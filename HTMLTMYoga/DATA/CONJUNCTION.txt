1 1883 122 REDUCING PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AND OBESITY THROUGH YOGA PRACTICE. BACKGROUND: YOGA PRACTICE HAS BEEN EFFECTIVELY PRESCRIBED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER MEDICAL AND YOGIC PROCEDURES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE PSYCHOSOMATIC DISEASES, INCLUDING CANCER, BRONCHIAL ASTHMA, COLITIS, PEPTIC AND ULCER. IT IMPROVES STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY, AND MAY HELP CONTROL PHYSIOLOGICAL VARIABLES SUCH AS BLOOD PRESSURE, LIPIDS, RESPIRATION, HEART RATE, AND METABOLIC RATE TO IMPROVE OVERALL EXERCISE CAPACITY. AIM OF THE STUDY: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGIC PRACTICE ON ANXIETY/DEPRESSION ASSOCIATED WITH OBESITY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PATIENTS WERE RECRUITED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSIOLOGY, C.S.M. MEDICAL UNIVERSITY (ERSTWHILE KGMU), LUCKNOW, UTTAR PRADESH, INDIA. A TOTAL OF 272 SUBJECTS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: 1) GROUP OF 205 SUBJECTS (WITH YOGIC PRACTICE) AND 2) A CONTROL GROUP OF 67 SUBJECTS (WITH AEROBIC EXERCISE). ASSESSMENT OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION WERE DONE BY HAMILTON RATING SCALE. RESULT: THIS STUDY SUPPORTS YOGA AS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL WITH NO DIET RESTRICTION TO IMPROVE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AS WELL AS OBESITY IN OBESE SUBJECTS CONCLUSION: INCORPORATING YOGIC ASANA IN THE TREATMENT PROTOCOL OF PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION MAY PROVE BENEFICIAL IN THE LONG RUN.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
2 1400  68 IMPACT OF YOGA NIDRA ON PSYCHOLOGICAL GENERAL WELLBEING IN PATIENTS WITH MENSTRUAL IRREGULARITIES: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: YOGIC RELAXATION THERAPY (YOGA NIDRA) HAS BEEN EFFECTIVELY PRESCRIBED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER MEDICAL AND YOGIC PROCEDURES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE PSYCHOSOMATIC DISEASES, INCLUDING CANCER, BRONCHIAL ASTHMA, COLITIS, PEPTIC ULCER AND MENSTRUAL IRREGULARITIES. AIM OF THE STUDY: TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF YOGA NIDRA ON PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS IN PATIENTS WITH MENSTRUAL DISORDERS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PATIENTS WERE RECRUITED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY, C.S.M. MEDICAL UNIVERSITY (ERSTWHILE KGMU), LUCKNOW, UTTAR PRADESH, INDIA. A TOTAL OF 150 FEMALE SUBJECTS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: 1) GROUP OF 75 SUBJECTS (WITH YOGIC INTERVENTION) AND 2) A CONTROL GROUP OF 75 SUBJECTS (WITHOUT YOGIC INTERVENTION). ASSESSMENT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL GENERAL WELLBEING (TOOL) WAS USED FOR ALL THE SUBJECTS ASSESSMENT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL GENERAL WELL BEING (TOOL) WAS USED FOR ALL THE SUBJECTS (CASES AND CONTROLS). THIS ASSESSMENT WAS DONE TWICE FIRST TIME IN THE BEGINNING (BASELINE) AND THEN AFTER SIX MONTHS. RESULTS: ANXIETY DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (P<0.003) AND DEPRESSION DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (P<0.01) IN THE YOGA GROUP. POSITIVE WELLBEING AND GENERAL HEALTH IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY (P<0.02), AND VITALITY IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY (P<0.01) AFTER SIX MONTHS OF YOGA THERAPY (YOGA NIDRA) IN THE YOGA GROUP COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: THE CURRENT FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT PATIENTS WITH MENSTRUAL IRREGULARITIES HAVING PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE AREAS OF THEIR WELLBEING, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION BY LEARNING AND APPLYING A PROGRAM BASED ON YOGIC INTERVENTION (YOGA NIDRA).	2011	
                                                                                                                   
3 1977  50 SIX-MONTH TRIAL OF YOGA NIDRA IN MENSTRUAL DISORDER PATIENTS: EFFECTS ON SOMATOFORM SYMPTOMS. BACKGROUND: YOGA NIDRA IS A SUCCESSFUL THERAPY FOR BOTH RECENT AND LONG-STANDING PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTURBANCES OF ALL KINDS ESPECIALLY DEPRESSION AND HIGH ANXIETY LEVEL AND NEUROTIC PATTERNS. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT WORK, THEREFORE, WAS TO CONDUCT A PRELIMINARY RANDOMIZED STUDY OF YOGA NIDRA AS A TREATMENT IN THE PATIENTS OF MENSTRUAL DISORDERS WITH SOMATOFORM SYMPTOMS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PATIENTS WERE RECRUITED FROM DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY, CSM MEDICAL UNIVERSITY (ERSTWHILE KGMU) LUCKNOW, UTTAR PRADESH, INDIA. ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FEMALE PATIENTS WITH MENSTRUAL DISORDERS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED IN TO TWO GROUPS 1- INTERVENTION GROUP: 75 SUBJECTS (YOGA NIDRA INTERVENTION AND MEDICATION) 2- CONTROL GROUP: 75 SUBJECTS (WITHOUT YOGA NIDRA INTERVENTION ONLY MEDICATION). SCHEDULE FOR CLINICAL ASSESSMENT IN NEUROPSYCHIATRY TOOL WAS USED. RESULTS: THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PAIN SYMPTOMS (P<0.006), GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS (P<0.04), CARDIOVASCULAR SYMPTOMS (P<0.02) AND UROGENITAL SYMPTOMS (P<0.005) AFTER 6 MONTHS OF YOGA NIDRA THERAPY IN INTERVENTION GROUP IN COMPARISON TO CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: YOGA NIDRA APPEARS TO BE A PROMISING INTERVENTION FOR PSYCHOSOMATIC PROBLEMS. IT IS COST-EFFECTIVE AND EASY TO IMPLEMENT. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT SOMATOFORM SYMPTOMS IN PATIENTS WITH MENSTRUAL DISORDER CAN BE DECREASED BY LEARNING AND APPLYING A PROGRAM BASED ON YOGIC INTERVENTION (YOGA NIDRA).	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
4 2725  52 YOGA NIDRA AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IN PATIENTS WITH MENSTRUAL DISORDER. BACKGROUND: EMOTIONAL INSECURITY, STRESS, DEPRESSIVE OR/AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS ARE COMMON WITH VARIABLE SEVERITY AMONG PATIENTS WITH MENSTRUAL DISORDER. YOGIC RELAXATION THERAPY (YOGA NIDRA) LEADS TO CONSCIOUS AND SUBCONSCIOUS RECOGNITION OF THESE UNDERLYING PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS AND HELPS RELEASING OF SUPPRESSED CONFLICTS. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA NIDRA ON ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IN PATIENTS WITH MENSTRUAL DISORDERS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SUBJECTS WERE RECRUITED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY, C.S.M. MEDICAL UNIVERSITY (ERSTWHILE KGMU), LUCKNOW UTTAR PRADESH, INDIA. THE SUBJECTS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED IN TO TWO GROUPS: INTERVENTION GROUP (WITH YOGIC INTERVENTION) AND CONTROL GROUP (WITHOUT YOGIC INTERVENTION). ASSESSMENTS OF ALL SUBJECTS WERE CARRIED OUT BY ADMINISTERING HAMILTON ANXIETY SCALE (HAM-A) AND HAMILTON RATING SCALE FOR DEPRESSION (HAM-D) AT BASELINE AND AFTER SIX MONTHS. RESULTS: THE MEAN AGE WITH S.D OF THE INTERVENTION GROUP WAS 27.67 +/- 7.85 YEARS, AND FOR CONTROL GROUP WAS 26.58 +/- 6.87 YEARS (AMONG COMPLETED INTERVENTION GROUP NN = 65 AND CONTROL GROUP NN = 61). THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF SCORES IN HAM-A (P<0.003) AND HAM-D (P<0.02) RESPECTIVELY IN SUBJECTS WITH MILD TO MODERATE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AFTER SIX MONTHS OF YOGA THERAPY (YOGA NIDRA) IN INTERVENTION GROUP IN COMPARISON TO CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: THE PATIENTS WITH MILD TO MODERATE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IMPROVE SIGNIFICANTLY WITH 'YOGA NIDRA' INTERVENTION. THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE PATIENTS WITH SEVERE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                  
5 1822  33 PROTOCOL TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF YOGA SUPPLEMENTATION ON COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN SCHIZOPHRENIA: A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: SCHIZOPHRENIA (SZ) IS A CHRONIC ILLNESS THAT IS TREATED SYMPTOMATICALLY. COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION IS A CORE FEATURE OF SZ THAT IS RELATIVELY INTRACTABLE TO PHARMACOTHERAPY. YOGA CAN IMPROVE COGNITIVE FUNCTION AMONG HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS. A RECENT OPEN TRIAL INDICATED SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS OF YOGA TRAINING (YT) IN CONJUNCTION WITH CONVENTIONAL PHARMACOTHERAPY AMONG PATIENTS WITH SZ. AIMS: TO DESCRIBE THE PROTOCOL FOR AN ONGOING RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL DESIGNED TO TEST WHETHER THE REPORTED BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YT ON COGNITIVE FUNCTION AMONG SZ PATIENTS CAN BE REPLICATED. SECONDARILY, THE EFFECTS OF YT ON DAILY FUNCTIONING LIVING SKILLS ARE EVALUATED. METHODS: CONSENTING PATIENTS WITH SZ RECEIVE ROUTINE CLINICAL TREATMENT AND ARE RANDOMISED TO ADJUNCTIVE YT, ADJUNCTIVE PHYSICAL EXERCISE (PE) OR TREATMENT AS USUAL (PROPOSED N = 234 TOTAL, N = 78 IN EACH GROUP). THE TRIAL INVOLVES YT OR PE 5 DAYS A WEEK AND LASTS 3 WEEKS. PARTICIPANTS ARE EVALUATED THRICE OVER 6 MONTHS. COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS MEASURED BY TRAIL MAKING TEST, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA NEUROCOGNITIVE COMPUTERISED BATTERY WERE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES WHILE CLINICAL SEVERITY AND DAILY FUNCTIONING MEASURED BY INDEPENDENT LIVING SKILLS SURVEY WERE SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 309 PARTICIPANTS HAVE BEEN RANDOMISED AS OF 31 AUGUST 2013, WHICH EXCEEDED BEYOND 294 PROPOSED AFTER ATTRITION. ONCE PARTICIPANTS BEGIN YT OR PE THEY GENERALLY COMPLETE THE PROTOCOL. NO INJURIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS: SHORT TERM YT IS FEASIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE TO INDIAN SZ PATIENTS. IF BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YT ARE DETECTED, IT WILL PROVIDE A NOVEL ADJUNCTIVE COGNITIVE REMEDIATION STRATEGY FOR SZ PATIENTS.	2014	
                                                                
6 1252  27 FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY AND EVALUATION OF MEDITATION TO AUGMENT YOGA PRACTICE AMONG PERSONS DIAGNOSED WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA. OBJECTIVE: TO DESIGN A MEDITATION PROTOCOL AND TEST ITS FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY AND EFFICACY IN CONJUNCTION WITH YT FOR PERSONS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA (SZ). METHODS: THE MEDITATION PROTOCOL CONSISTED OF ANAPANA (OBSERVING NORMAL RESPIRATION) AND YOGA NIDRA (SUPINE, RESTFUL AWARENESS). IN A SINGLE BLIND RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, MEDICATED AND CLINICALLY STABLE OUTPATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH SZ WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE TREATMENT AS USUAL (TAU), TAU AUGMENTED WITH YOGA TRAINING (YT), OR TAU AUGMENTED WITH MEDITATION AND YOGA TRAINING (MYT) FOR THREE WEEKS (N=145). ACCEPTABILITY, CLINICAL, SOCIAL AND COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS WERE ASSESSED AFTER 3 WEEKS AND 3 MONTHS POST RANDOMIZATION USING WITHIN GROUP AND BETWEEN GROUPS ANALYSES WITH REPEATED MEASURES MULTIVARIATE TESTS. RESULTS: NO GROUP-WISE DIFFERENCES IN COMPLIANCE, STUDY DISCONTINUATION, MAJOR/SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS OR ADVERSE EVENTS WERE NOTED. FOR SIX ASSESSED CLINICAL VARIABLES, THE DIRECTION OF CHANGES WERE IN THE DESIRED DIRECTION AND THE EFFECT SIZES WERE GREATER IN THE MYT GROUP COMPARED WITH THE TAU GROUP AT BOTH TIME POINTS. CHANGES IN SOCIAL FUNCTION VARIABLES WERE GREATER AT 3 MONTHS THAN AT 3 WEEKS. NOMINALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN INDIVIDUAL COGNITIVE DOMAINS WERE NOTED IN ALL GROUPS AT BOTH TIME POINTS. ALL EFFECT SIZES WERE IN THE SMALL TO MEDIUM RANGE. CONCLUSION: MYT IS FEASIBLE, ACCEPTABLE AND SHOWS MODEST BENEFITS FOR PERSONS WITH SZ. MYT CAN ALSO IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE AND CLINICAL SYMPTOMS. LARGER STUDIES OF LONGER DURATION ARE WARRANTED.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
7 2469  22 YOGA AS A TREATMENT FOR BINGE EATING DISORDER: A PRELIMINARY STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE EFFICACY OF A 12-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM AIMED AT REDUCING BINGE EATING SEVERITY. DESIGN: A RANDOMISED TRIAL WAS UNDERTAKEN ASSIGNING PARTICIPANTS TO YOGA (N=45) OR WAIT-LIST CONTROL (N=45) GROUPS. OF THESE, 25 IN EACH GROUP WERE ANALYSED. PARTICIPANTS: A COMMUNITY-BASED SAMPLE OF WOMEN BETWEEN 25 AND 63 YEARS OF AGE WHO IDENTIFIED WITH DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR BINGE EATING DISORDER (BED) AND A BMI>25 WERE RECRUITED FOR THE STUDY. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PRIMARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED THE BINGE EATING SCALE (BES) AND INTERNATIONAL PHYSICAL ACTIVITY QUESTIONNAIRE (IPAQ). SECONDARY OUTCOMES COMPRISED MEASURES FOR BMI, HIPS AND WAIST. RESULTS: FOR THE YOGA GROUP, SELF-REPORTED REDUCTIONS IN BINGE EATING AND INCREASES IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. SMALL YET STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS FOR BMI, HIPS AND WAIST MEASUREMENT WERE OBTAINED. THE WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP DID NOT IMPROVE SIGNIFICANTLY ON ANY MEASURES. CONCLUSION: IN CONJUNCTION WITH FORMAL WEEKLY SESSIONS, HOME-BASED YOGA PROGRAMS ARE POTENTIALLY EFFICACIOUS FOR THE TREATMENT OF BINGE EATING.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
8  273  30 ADDING A FACEBOOK SUPPORT GROUP TO AN ONLINE YOGA RANDOMIZED TRIAL FOR WOMEN WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED STILLBIRTH: A FEASIBILITY STUDY. OBJECTIVES: WOMEN WHO EXPERIENCE STILLBIRTH ARE MORE LIKELY TO DEVELOP POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD), AND ANXIOUS AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS THAN THOSE WHO DELIVER LIVE HEALTHY BABIES. PARTICIPANTS IN A RECENT STUDY OF ONLINE YOGA (OY) REPORTED A DESIRE FOR MORE SOCIAL SUPPORT, WHICH MAY HELP REDUCE PTSD RELATED TO GRIEF AND AID IN COPING. FACEBOOK (FB) HAS BEEN USED SUCCESSFULLY TO DELIVER SUPPORT FOR ONLINE INTERVENTIONS, BUT LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT ITS USE IN CONJUNCTION WITH OY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF A FB SUPPORT GROUP IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN 8-WEEK OY INTERVENTION. DESIGN: RANDOMIZED PARALLEL FEASIBILITY TRIAL WITH A 1:1 STUDY GROUP ALLOCATION RATIO. SETTING/LOCATION: ONLINE. SUBJECTS: WOMEN (N = 60) WHO EXPERIENCED STILLBIRTH WITHIN THE PAST 3 YEARS. INTERVENTIONS: PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED NATIONALLY TO PARTICIPATE AND RANDOMIZED INTO ONE OF TWO GROUPS: OY ONLY (N = 30) OR ONLINE YOGA WITH FACEBOOK (OYFB) (N = 30). BOTH GROUPS WERE ASKED TO COMPLETE 60 MIN OF OY PER WEEK. WOMEN IN THE OY GROUP WERE ASKED TO LOG ON TO A FB PAGE AT LEAST ONCE PER WEEK. OUTCOME MEASURES: ACCEPTABILITY (I.E., SATISFACTION) AND DEMAND (I.E., ATTENDANCE), PTSD, ANXIETY, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, SOCIAL SUPPORT. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS WERE SATISFIED WITH AND ENJOYED OY, AND 8/13 FB ACCEPTABILITY BENCHMARKS WERE MET. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS IN MINUTES OF YOGA PER WEEK. CONCLUSIONS: THE ADDITION OF A FB GROUP TO AN OY INTERVENTION FOR WOMEN WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED STILLBIRTH IS FEASIBLE, ALTHOUGH MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO INCREASE ITS EFFICACY.

9  529  26 COMPARISON OF PROTEIN-PACING ALONE OR WITH YOGA/STRETCHING AND RESISTANCE TRAINING ON GLYCEMIA, TOTAL AND REGIONAL BODY COMPOSITION, AND AEROBIC FITNESS IN OVERWEIGHT WOMEN. BACKGROUND: YOGA/STRETCHING (YS) AND FUNCTIONAL RESISTANCE (FR) TRAINING ARE POPULAR EXERCISE ROUTINES. A PROTEIN-PACING (PP) DIET IS A COMMON DIETARY REGIMEN. THUS, WE ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A PP DIET ALONE AND IN COMBINATION WITH EITHER YS OR FR TO IMPROVE BODY COMPOSITION AND CARDIOMETABOLIC HEALTH. METHODS: TWENTY-SEVEN OVERWEIGHT WOMEN (AGE = 43.2 +/- 4.6 YEARS) WERE RANDOMIZED INTO 3 GROUPS: YOGA (YS, N = 8) OR RESISTANCE (FR, N = 10) TRAINING (3 DAYS/WEEK) IN CONJUNCTION WITH PP DIET (50% CARBOHYDRATE, 25% PROTEIN, AND 25% FAT) OR PP DIET-ONLY (PP, N = 9) THROUGHOUT 12-WEEK STUDY. PP MAINTAINED PREEXISTING LEVELS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. BODY WEIGHT (BW), TOTAL (BF) AND ABDOMINAL (ABF) BODY FAT, WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE (WC), PLASMA BIOMARKERS, AND AEROBIC FITNESS (VO2) WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE AND 12 WEEKS. RESULTS: WC AND TOTAL CHOLESTEROL IMPROVED IN ALL GROUPS, WHEREAS GLYCEMIA TENDED TO IMPROVE (P = .06) IN S. BF, ABF, AND VO2 INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN YS AND FR (P < .05). FEELINGS OF VIGOR INCREASED IN YS AND TENSION DECREASED IN FR (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: YS TRAINING TENDED TO DECREASE BLOOD GLUCOSE COMPARED WITH FR AND PP AND IS EQUALLY EFFECTIVE AT ENHANCING BODY COMPOSITION, AND AEROBIC FITNESS IN OVERWEIGHT WOMEN PROVIDING A STRONG RATIONALE FOR FURTHER RESEARCH ON YS TRAINING.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
10  288  28 ADJUNCTIVE COGNITIVE REMEDIATION FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA USING YOGA: AN OPEN, NON-RANDOMIZED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: YOGA THERAPY (YT) IMPROVES COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS, BUT ITS IMPACT ON COGNITIVE FUNCTION AMONG PERSONS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA (SZ) HAS NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED. AIMS: EVALUATE ADJUNCTIVE YT FOR COGNITIVE DOMAINS IMPAIRED IN SZ. METHODS: PATIENTS WITH SZ RECEIVED YT OR TREATMENT AS USUAL (TAU; N = 65, N = 23, RESPECTIVELY). ACCURACY AND SPEED FOR SEVEN COGNITIVE DOMAINS WERE ASSESSED USING A COMPUTERIZED NEUROCOGNITIVE BATTERY (CNB), THUS MINIMIZING OBSERVER BIAS. SEPARATELY, YT WAS EVALUATED AMONG PATIENTS WITH BIPOLAR I DISORDER (N = 40), MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (N = 37), AND CARDIOLOGY OUTPATIENTS (N = 68). ALL PATIENTS ALSO RECEIVED ROUTINE PHARMACOTHERAPY. PATIENTS WERE NOT RANDOMIZED TO YT OR TAU. RESULTS: COMPARED WITH THE SZ/TAU GROUP, THE SZ/YT GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENT WITH REGARD TO MEASURES OF ATTENTION FOLLOWING CORRECTIONS FOR MULTIPLE COMPARISONS; THE CHANGES WERE MORE PROMINENT AMONG THE MEN. IN THE OTHER DIAGNOSTIC GROUPS, DIFFERING PATTERNS OF IMPROVEMENTS WERE NOTED WITH SMALL TO MEDIUM EFFECT SIZES. CONCLUSIONS: OUR INITIAL ANALYSES SUGGEST NOMINALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN SCHIZOPHRENIA WITH ADJUNCTIVE THERAPIES SUCH AS YT. THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CHANGE VARIES BY COGNITIVE DOMAIN AND MAY ALSO VARY BY DIAGNOSTIC GROUP.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
11 2672  30 YOGA IN PREMATURE EJACULATION: A COMPARATIVE TRIAL WITH FLUOXETINE. INTRODUCTION: YOGA IS A POPULAR FORM OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT. IT IS PRACTICED BOTH IN DEVELOPING AND DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. USE OF YOGA FOR VARIOUS BODILY AILMENTS IS RECOMMENDED IN ANCIENT AYVURVEDIC (AYUS = LIFE, VEDA = KNOWLEDGE) TEXTS AND IS BEING INCREASINGLY INVESTIGATED SCIENTIFICALLY. MANY PATIENTS AND YOGA PROTAGONISTS CLAIM THAT IT IS USEFUL IN SEXUAL DISORDERS. WE ARE INTERESTED IN KNOWING IF IT WORKS FOR PATIENTS WITH PREMATURE EJACULATION (PE) AND IN COMPARING ITS EFFICACY WITH FLUOXETINE, A KNOWN TREATMENT OPTION FOR PE. AIM: TO KNOW IF YOGA COULD BE TRIED AS A TREATMENT OPTION IN PE AND TO COMPARE IT WITH FLUOXETINE. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 68 PATIENTS (38 YOGA GROUP; 30 FLUOXETINE GROUP) ATTENDING THE OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY OF A TERTIARY CARE HOSPITAL WERE ENROLLED IN THE PRESENT STUDY. BOTH SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT TOOLS WERE ADMINISTERED TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF THE YOGA AND FLUOXETINE IN PE. THREE PATIENTS DROPPED OUT OF THE STUDY CITING THEIR INABILITY TO COPE UP WITH THE YOGA SCHEDULE AS THE REASON. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: INTRAVAGINAL EJACULATORY LATENCIES IN YOGA GROUP AND FLUOXETINE CONTROL GROUPS. RESULTS: WE FOUND THAT ALL 38 PATIENTS (25-65.7% = GOOD, 13-34.2% = FAIR) BELONGING TO YOGA AND 25 OUT OF 30 OF THE FLUOXETINE GROUP (82.3%) HAD STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PE. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA APPEARS TO BE A FEASIBLE, SAFE, EFFECTIVE AND ACCEPTABLE NONPHARMACOLOGICAL OPTION FOR PE. MORE STUDIES INVOLVING LARGER PATIENTS COULD BE CARRIED OUT TO ESTABLISH ITS UTILITY IN THIS CONDITION.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
12 1399  36 IMPACT OF YOGA NIDRA ON MENSTRUAL ABNORMALITIES IN FEMALES OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE. OBJECTIVES: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO OBSERVE THE EFFECT OF YOGA NIDRA PRACTICE ON HORMONE LEVELS IN PATIENTS WHO HAD MENSTRUAL IRREGULARITIES. DESIGN: THE STUDY WAS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTINGS/LOCATION: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY AT CHHATRAPATI SAHUJI MAHARAJ MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, UTTAR PRADESH, LUCKNOW, INDIA. SUBJECTS WERE DIVIDED RANDOMLY INTO 2 GROUPS-AN INTERVENTION AND A CONTROL GROUP, WITH 75 SUBJECTS IN EACH GROUP. OF THESE SUBJECTS, 126 COMPLETED THE STUDY PROTOCOL. SUBJECTS: THIS STUDY INVOLVED 150 SUBJECTS WITH MENSTRUAL IRREGULARITIES; 126 OF WHOM COMPLETED THE PROTOCOL. INTERVENTIONS: THE INTERVENTION WAS THE PRACTICE OF YOGA NIDRA. THE YOGIC INTERVENTION DURATION WAS 35-40 MINUTES/DAY, FIVE TIMES/WEEK FOR 6 MONTHS. AN ESTIMATION OF HORMONAL PROFILE WAS DONE FOR BOTH GROUPS AT BASELINE AND AFTER 6 MONTHS. RESULTS: THYROID-STIMULATING HORMONE (P<0.002), FOLLICLE-STIMULATING HORMONE (P<0.02), LUTEINIZING HORMONE (P<0.001), AND PROLACTIN (P<0.02) WERE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP, COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: THE PRESENT STUDY DEMONSTRATED THE EFFICACY OF YOGA NIDRA ON HORMONE PROFILES IN PATIENTS WITH MENSTRUAL IRREGULARITIES. YOGA NIDRA PRACTICE WAS HELPFUL IN PATIENTS WITH HORMONE IMBALANCES, SUCH AS DYSMENORRHEA, OLIGOMENORRHEA, MENORRHAGIA, METRORRHAGIA, AND HYPOMENORRHEA.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
13 2401  27 YOGA AND EATING DISORDER PREVENTION AND TREATMENT: A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. YOGA IS FREQUENTLY USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH STANDARD TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR EATING DISORDERS. HOWEVER, YOGA'S EFFICACY AND EFFECTIVENESS IN PREVENTING AND TREATING EATING DISORDERS HAS REMAINED UNCLEAR. THE AIM OF THIS COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS IS TO REVIEW THE EXTANT LITERATURE AND ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN THE PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION OF EATING DISORDER SYMPTOMS AND CORRELATES IN BOTH CLINICAL AND NON-CLINICAL POPULATIONS. STUDIES ASSESSING YOGA AND ITS EFFECT ON EATING DISORDER SYMPTOMS AND/OR BODY IMAGE AS RELATED TO DISORDERED EATING, WERE ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION. THE COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW DETAILS CORRELATIONAL, NON-CONTROLLED, NON-RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED, AND YOGA COMPARISON STUDIES. FOR THE META-ANALYSIS, ONLY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS COMPARING A YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION TO A NON-YOGA CONTROL GROUP WERE INCLUDED. IN TOTAL, 43 STUDIES ARE INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW, WITH 11 TRIALS INVOLVING 754 PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED IN THE META-ANALYSIS. RESULTS OF THE COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW AND META-ANALYSES RESULTS INDICATED YOGA INTERVENTIONS DEMONSTRATED A SMALL, SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON GLOBAL EATING DISORDER PSYCHOPATHOLOGY, A MODERATE-TO-LARGE EFFECT ON BINGE EATING AND BULIMIA, AND A SMALL EFFECT ON BODY IMAGE CONCERNS, AS COMPARED TO THE CONTROL CONDITIONS. THERE WAS NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON DIETARY RESTRAINT IN EITHER DIRECTION. ADDITIONALLY, RESULTS INDICATED A SMALL-TO-MODERATE EFFECT ON A COMPOSITE MEASURE OF EATING DISORDER-RELATED CONSTRUCTS. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE APPROACH SUPPORTING THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF EATING DISORDERS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                        
14 1403  17 IMPACT OF YOGA ON CARDIAC AUTONOMIC FUNCTION AND ARRHYTHMIAS. WITH THE EXPANDING INTEGRATION OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE (CAM) PRACTICES IN CONJUNCTION WITH MODERN MEDICINE, YOGA HAS QUICKLY RISEN TO BEING ONE OF THE MOST COMMON CAM PRACTICES ACROSS THE WORLD. DESPITE WIDESPREAD USE OF YOGA, LIMITED STUDIES ARE AVAILABLE, PARTICULARLY IN THE SETTING OF DYSRHYTHMIA. PRELIMINARY STUDIES DEMONSTRATE PROMISING RESULTS FROM INTEGRATION OF YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT TO MEDICAL THERAPY FOR MANAGEMENT OF DYSRHYTHMIAS. IN THIS REVIEW, WE DISCUSS THE ROLE OF AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IN CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIA,INTERACTION OF YOGA WITH AUTONOMIC TONE AND ITS SUBSEQUENT IMPACT ON THESE DISEASE STATES. THE ROLE OF YOGA IN SPECIFIC DISEASE STATES, AND POTENTIAL FUTURE DIRECTION FOR STUDIES ASSESSING THE ROLE OF YOGA IN DYSRHYTHMIA.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
15 1823  34 PSYCHO-BIOLOGICAL CHANGES WITH ADD ON YOGA NIDRA IN PATIENTS WITH MENSTRUAL DISORDERS: A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: MENSTRUAL DISORDERS ARE COMMON PROBLEMS AMONG WOMEN IN THE REPRODUCTIVE AGE GROUP. YUGA INTERVENTIONS MAY DECREASE THE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS RELATED TO MENSTRUAL DISORDERS. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS AIMED TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF YOGA NIDRA ON PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS IN PATIENTS WITH MENSTRUAL DISORDERS. METHODS: A TOTAL NUMBER OF 100 WOMEN RECRUITED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY AND WERE THEN RANDOMLY ALLOCATED INTO TWO GROUPS: A) INTERVENTION RECEIVED YOGIC INTERVENTION AND MEDICATION FOR 6 MONTH, AND B) CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED NO YOGIC INTERVENTION AND THEY ONLY RECEIVED PRESCRIBED MEDICATION). PSYCHOLOGICAL GENERAL WELL-BEING INDEX (PGWBI) AND HORMONAL PROFILE WERE ASSESSED AT THE TIME OF BEFORE AND AFTER SIX MONTHS ON BOTH GROUPS. RESULTS: THE MEAN SCORE OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, POSITIVE WELL-BEING, GENERAL HEALTH, AND VITALITY SCORES, AS WELL AS HORMONAL LEVELS, IN POSTTEST WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT IN INTERVENTION GROUP AS COMPARED WITH PRETEST. BUT THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: YOGA NIDRA CAN BE A SUCCESSFUL THERAPY TO OVERCOME THE PSYCHIATRIC MORBIDITY ASSOCIATED WITH MENSTRUAL IRREGULARITIES. THEREFORE, YOGIC RELAXATION TRAINING (YOGA NIDRA) COULD BE PRESCRIBED AS AN ADJUNCT TO CONVENTIONAL DRUG THERAPY FOR MENSTRUAL DYSFUNCTION.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
16 1554  24 LIVING ANATOME: TEACHING AND LEARNING MUSCULOSKELETAL ANATOMY THROUGH YOGA AND PILATES. LIVING ANATOME, A PROGRAM DESIGNED IN 2004 BY TWO MEDICAL STUDENTS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DIRECTOR OF ANATOMY, TEACHES MUSCULOSKELETAL ANATOMY THROUGH YOGA AND PILATES. PREVIOUSLY OFFERED AS AN ADJUNCT TO THE GROSS ANATOMY COURSE IN 2007, LIVING ANATOME BECAME AN OFFICIAL PART OF THE CURRICULUM. PREVIOUS RESEARCH CONDUCTED ON THE PROGRAM DEMONSTRATED ITS EFFICACY IN PROVIDING RELAXATION AND WELL-BEING TO STUDENTS WHO ATTENDED. IN 2007, WITH ALL 144 GROSS ANATOMY STUDENTS REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN A 1.5 HOUR LIVING ANATOME SESSION ON THE UPPER AND LOWER LIMBS, THE IMPACT OF THE PROGRAM ON STUDENTS' COMPREHENSION OF MUSCULOSKELETAL ANATOMY WAS ANALYZED THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATION OF 25-QUESTION PRE- AND POST-TESTS, GAUGING KNOWLEDGE IN THE FOLLOWING DOMAINS: UPPER LIMB, LOWER LIMB, MUSCLE FUNCTION, PALPATION, ATTACHMENT/LOCATION, CLINICAL CORRELATE, AND CONTROL (I.E., MATERIAL NOT EMPHASIZED DURING THE INTERVENTION). ANALYSIS OF POSTINTERVENTION TESTS REVEALED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN TOTAL LIVING ANATOME SCORES AS WELL AS IN THE DOMAINS OF UPPER LIMB, MUSCLE FUNCTION, AND PALPATION, INDICATING THE POSSIBLE EFFICACY OF LIVING ANATOME IN TEACHING ANATOMY. PERFORMANCE ON CONTROL QUESTIONS ALSO IMPROVED, ALTHOUGH NOT SIGNIFICANTLY, WHICH MAY INDICATE THE ROLE OF OTHER VARIABLES (E.G., ADDITIONAL STUDY TIME) IN INCREASED PERFORMANCE.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
17  161  26 A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF ADJUNCTIVE YOGA AND ADJUNCTIVE PHYSICAL EXERCISE TRAINING FOR COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION IN SCHIZOPHRENIA. BACKGROUND: YOGA AND PHYSICAL EXERCISE HAVE BEEN USED AS ADJUNCTIVE INTERVENTION FOR COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION IN SCHIZOPHRENIA (SZ), BUT CONTROLLED COMPARISONS ARE LACKING. AIMS A SINGLE-BLIND RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE WHETHER YOGA TRAINING OR PHYSICAL EXERCISE TRAINING ENHANCE COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS IN SZ, BASED ON A PRIOR PILOT STUDY. METHODS: CONSENTING, CLINICALLY STABLE, ADULT OUTPATIENTS WITH SZ (N=286) COMPLETED BASELINE ASSESSMENTS AND WERE RANDOMISED TO TREATMENT AS USUAL (TAU), SUPERVISED YOGA TRAINING WITH TAU (YT) OR SUPERVISED PHYSICAL EXERCISE TRAINING WITH TAU (PE). BASED ON THE PILOT STUDY, THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS SPEED INDEX FOR THE COGNITIVE DOMAIN OF 'ATTENTION' IN THE PENN COMPUTERISED NEUROCOGNITIVE BATTERY. USING MIXED MODELS AND CONTRASTS, COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS AT BASELINE, 21 DAYS (END OF TRAINING), 3 AND 6 MONTHS POST-TRAINING WERE EVALUATED WITH INTENTION-TO-TREAT PARADIGM. RESULTS: SPEED INDEX OF ATTENTION DOMAIN IN THE YT GROUP SHOWED GREATER IMPROVEMENT THAN PE AT 6 MONTHS FOLLOW-UP (P<0.036, EFFECT SIZE 0.51). IN THE PE GROUP, 'ACCURACY INDEX OF ATTENTION DOMAIN SHOWED GREATER IMPROVEMENT THAN TAU ALONE AT 6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP (P<0.025, EFFECT SIZE 0.61). FOR SEVERAL OTHER COGNITIVE DOMAINS, SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE OBSERVED WITH YT OR PE COMPARED WITH TAU ALONE (P<0.05, EFFECT SIZES 0.30-1.97). CONCLUSIONS: BOTH YT AND PE IMPROVED ATTENTION AND ADDITIONAL COGNITIVE DOMAINS WELL PAST THE TRAINING PERIOD, SUPPORTING OUR PRIOR REPORTED BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF YT ON SPEED INDEX OF ATTENTION DOMAIN. AS ADJUNCTS, YT OR PE CAN BENEFIT INDIVIDUALS WITH SZ.	2017	
                                                                                                                       
18 1500  20 INTRODUCTION TO THE SPECIAL ISSUE ON YOGA AND POSITIVE EMBODIMENT: A NOTE FROM THE EDITORS ON HOW WE GOT HERE. STUDYING THE PRACTICE OF YOGA AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO BODY IMAGE, EMBODIMENT, AND EATING DISORDERS BRINGS TOGETHER THE PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL ASPECTS OF OUR LIVES AS YOGA PRACTITIONERS, RESEARCHERS, AND WOMEN LIVING IN BODIES WITHIN A SOCIETY THAT CAN BE TOUGH ON BODY APPRECIATION. DEVELOPING THIS EDITION ON "YOGA FOR POSITIVE EMBODIMENT IN EATING DISORDER PREVENTION AND TREATMENT" HAS BEEN A WORK OF LOVE FOR ALL OF US. AS YOGA PRACTITIONERS, WE HAVE PERSONALLY EXPERIENCED THE BENEFITS OF YOGA IN OUR OWN BODIES AND FELT THAT THERE MAY BE BENEFITS FOR OTHERS. AS RESEARCHERS, WE ARE DEDICATED TO THE EXPLORATION AND UTILIZATION OF EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICES TO ENHANCE WELL-BEING, PROMOTE A POSITIVE BODY IMAGE AND SENSE OF EMBODIMENT, AND BOTH PREVENT AND TREAT EATING DISORDERS. OUR EXPERIENCES AS YOGA PRACTITIONERS, IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR CURIOSITY AS RESEARCHERS, LED US TO EXPLORE THE EXTANT EVIDENCE FOR YOGA AS A TOOL FOR LEADING TO IMPROVEMENTS IN BODY IMAGE, DISORDERED EATING BEHAVIORS, AND EATING DISORDERS, AND TO EMBARK ON OUR OWN RESEARCH IN THIS AREA TO FILL NECESSARY GAPS IN OUR KNOWLEDGE BASE. OUR LONG-TERM DEDICATION TO THE FIELDS OF BODY IMAGE AND EATING DISORDERS, IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR EMERGING INTEREST IN YOGA AS A POTENTIAL TOOL, LED US TO THE COMPILATION OF THIS EDITION ON YOGA AND POSITIVE EMBODIMENT.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
19 1833  22 PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLNESS, YOGA AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS AFFECTED BY SCHIZOPHRENIA SPECTRUM DISORDERS: A PILOT STUDY. SCHIZOPHRENIA IS A SERIOUS PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER CHARACTERIZED BY POSITIVE SYMPTOMS, NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS AND NEUROCOGNITIVE DEFICITS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ESTIMATE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN WELLNESS, YOGA AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS AFFECTED BY SCHIZOPHRENIA SPECTRUM DISORDERS. PARTICIPANTS WERE 30 PATIENTS WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA IN CARE AT THE REHABILITATIVE PSYCHIATRY AND RESEARCH VILLA CHIARA CLINIC IN MASCALUCIA (CATANIA, ITALY), AFTER THAT RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO TWO GROUPS. THE FIRST GROUP FOLLOWED THE EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT WITH SETS OF YOGA EXERCISES CONDUCTED BY A YOGA TRAINER AND A PSYCHIATRIST OR A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST EXPERT IN YOGA, WHILE A SECOND CONTROL GROUP WAS TREATED WITH USUAL CARE. THE RESULTS REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE, BEFORE AND AFTER TREATMENT, BETWEEN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND THE CONTROL GROUP IN QUALITY OF LIFE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
20  498  30 COMBINED PELVIC MUSCLE EXERCISE AND YOGA PROGRAM FOR URINARY INCONTINENCE IN MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN. AIM: URINARY INCONTINENCE IS A MAJOR HEALTH PROBLEM AMONG MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN. PELVIC MUSCLE EXERCISE IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY INTERVENTIONS, BUT DIFFICULTY PERFORMING THIS EXERCISE HAS LED RESEARCHERS TO SEEK ALTERNATIVE OR CONJUNCTIVE EXERCISE. THIS STUDY AIMED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF A COMBINED PELVIC MUSCLE EXERCISE AND YOGA INTERVENTION PROGRAM ON URINARY INCONTINENCE. METHODS: A SINGLE GROUP PRE-/POST-TEST DESIGN WAS USED. SUBJECTS WERE RECRUITED FROM A COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER IN SEOUL, KOREA, AND A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED. FIFTY-FIVE WOMEN PARTICIPATED IN THE FIRST DAY OF THE PROGRAM, 34 OF WHOM COMPLETED THE 8 WEEK, TWICE WEEKLY INTERVENTION PROGRAM. URINARY INCONTINENCE WAS MEASURED BY FIVE DOMAINS OF URINARY TRACT SYMPTOMS: FILLING FACTOR, VOIDING FACTOR, INCONTINENCE FACTOR, SEXUAL FUNCTION, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. ALSO MEASURED WERE ATTITUDE TOWARD PELVIC MUSCLE EXERCISE AND PELVIC MUSCLE STRENGTH. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE FOUND IN ATTITUDE TOWARD PELVIC MUSCLE EXERCISE, PELVIC MUSCLE STRENGTH, AND INCONTINENCE FACTOR. DAILY PERFORMANCE OF PELVIC MUSCLE EXERCISE WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH IMPROVED INCONTINENCE FACTOR AND WITH QUALITY OF LIFE RELATED TO URINARY TRACT SYMPTOMS. CONCLUSION: A COMBINED PELVIC MUSCLE EXERCISE AND YOGA PROGRAM WAS EFFECTIVE FOR IMPROVING OVERALL URINARY INCONTINENCE IN COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER ATTENDEES IN KOREA. FURTHER STUDY IS NEEDED WITH A CONTROL GROUP, DIFFERENT POPULATIONS, AND A LONGER INTERVENTION PERIOD.	2015

1 1524 138 ISOMETRIC YOGA-LIKE MANEUVERS IMPROVE ADOLESCENT IDIOPATHIC SCOLIOSIS-A NONRANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: ASSESS THERAPEUTIC VALUE OF SPECIFIC YOGA POSES FOR THORACIC AND LUMBAR ADOLESCENT IDIOPATHIC SCOLIOSIS (AIS) TAUGHT IN OFFICE OR INTERNET. STUDY DESIGN: NONRANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL: FIFTY-SIX ADOLESCENTS (MEAN AGE 14.0 YEARS; MEAN RISSER 3.0) WERE RECRUITED FROM OUR CLINIC; 41 DID THE SIDE-PLANK, THE HALF-MOON AND ELEVATED SIDE PLANK POSES AS APPROPRIATE (TREATMENT GROUP) AND 15 DID NOT (CONTROLS). THIRTY CURVES WERE TREATED IN OFFICE, 30 VIA INTERNET. CURVE CHANGE WAS EVALUATED BY BLINDED SERIAL COBB ANGLES, AND ANALYZED USING MANN-WHITNEY U, PAIRED T-TESTS AND CHI(2). RESULTS: MEAN LUMBAR AND THORACOLUMBAR COBB ANGLE CHANGE WAS -9.2 (95% CI = -11.8, -6.6) IN THE TREATMENT GROUP AND 5.4 (95% CI = 1.7, 9.0) IN CONTROLS. BOTH TREATMENT GROUP IMPROVEMENT AND DETERIORATION IN CONTROLS WERE SIGNIFICANT (TREATMENT GROUP: PAIRED T-TEST T = -7.1, DF = 40, P = .000; CONTROLS: T = 3.2, DF = 12, P = .008). MEAN THORACIC COBB ANGLE CHANGE WAS -7.1 (95% CI = -13.1, -1.2) IN THE TREATMENT GROUP AND 9.3 (95% CI = 4.5, 14.6) IN CONTROLS. BOTH CHANGES WERE SIGNIFICANT (PAIRED T-TEST T = -3.3, DF = 21, P = .022 FOR TREATMENT GROUP; T = 4.5, DF = 5, P = .006 FOR CONTROLS). NINE INTERNET PATIENTS WERE NON-COMPLIANT VS. 6 OFFICE PATIENTS. OFFICE PATIENTS IMPROVED 1.6 DEGREES/MONTH OR 5.5%/MONTH; INTERNET PATIENTS IMPROVED .72 DEGREES/MONTH OR 3.3%/MONTH. CONCLUSION: THESE YOGA POSES SHOW PROMISE FOR REVERSING ADOLESCENT IDIOPATHIC SCOLIOSIS. TELEMEDICINE HAD GREATER NON-COMPLIANCE AND LOWER EFFICACY BUT STILL PRODUCED PATIENT IMPROVEMENT.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
2 1610  29 METABOLIC AND VENTILATORY CHANGES DURING AND AFTER HIGH-FREQUENCY YOGA BREATHING. BACKGROUND PRACTICING HIGH-FREQUENCY YOGA BREATHING (HFYB) INDUCED A HYPERMETABOLIC STATE IN A SINGLE SUBJECT DURING THE PRACTICE BUT THE EFFECT HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED IN MULTIPLE PRACTITIONERS. MATERIAL AND METHODS HEALTHY MALE VOLUNTEERS (N=47, GROUP MEAN AGE +/- S.D., 23.2 +/- 4.1 YEARS) WERE RECRUITED AS AN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND ANOTHER TWENTY VOLUNTEERS WERE RECRUITED AS A CONTROL GROUP. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PRACTICED EITHER HFYB (BREATH RATE 1.0 HZ) OR BREATH AWARENESS (BAW) ON TWO SEPARATE DAYS. THE SEQUENCE WAS REVERSED FOR ALTERNATE PARTICIPANTS. THE CONTROL GROUP WAS ASSESSED UNDER SIMILAR CONDITIONS WHILE SITTING AT EASE. THE BREATH RATE (RR), TIDAL VOLUME (VT), VENTILATION (VE), VO2, VCO2, ARTERIAL PCO2 AND ENERGY EXPENDITURE (EE KCAL/DAY) WERE ASSESSED FOR 35 MINUTES USING AN OPEN CIRCUIT OXYGEN CONSUMPTION ANALYZER. THE ASSESSMENT PERIOD WAS DIVIDED INTO BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER CONDITIONS. REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSES OF VARIANCE (ANOVA) WERE USED TO COMPARE DATA RECORDED DURING AND AFTER THE TWO PRACTICES WITH DATA RECORDED BEFORE. BEFORE-AFTER COMPARISONS IN THE CONTROL GROUP WERE WITH PAIRED T-TESTS. RESULTS THE MOST RELEVANT SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE INCREASES IN VE, VO2, VCO2 AND EE DURING HFYB, WHILE THE SAME VARIABLES DECREASED DURING THE CONTROL PERIOD. HOWEVER AFTER HFYB THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN VO2 OR EE, ALTHOUGH VE DECREASED AS IT DID AFTER THE CONTROL PERIOD. CONCLUSIONS HFYB INDUCES A HYPERMETABOLIC STATE FOR THE DURATION OF THE PRACTICE WHICH RETURNS TO BASELINE AFTER HFYB SUGGESTING A POSSIBLE APPLICATION FOR HFYB IN HYPOMETABOLIC STATES.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
3  868  29 EFFECT OF YOGA RELAXATION TECHNIQUES ON PERFORMANCE OF DIGIT-LETTER SUBSTITUTION TASK BY TEENAGERS. BACKGROUND/AIMS: MEMORY AND SELECTIVE ATTENTION ARE IMPORTANT SKILLS FOR ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL PERFORMANCE. TECHNIQUES TO IMPROVE THESE SKILLS ARE NOT TAUGHT EITHER IN EDUCATION OR COMPANY TRAINING COURSES. ANY SYSTEM WHICH CAN SYSTEMATICALLY IMPROVE THESE SKILLS WILL BE OF VALUE IN SCHOOLS, UNIVERSITIES, AND WORKPLACES. AIMS: TO INVESTIGATE POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS IN MEMORY AND SELECTIVE ATTENTION, AS MEASURED BY THE DIGIT-LETTER SUBSTITUTION TASK (DLST), DUE TO PRACTICE OF CYCLIC MEDITATION (CM), A YOGA RELAXATION TECHNIQUE, AS COMPARED TO SUPINE REST (SR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: SUBJECTS CONSISTED OF 253 SCHOOL STUDENTS, 156 BOYS, 97 GIRLS, IN THE AGE RANGE 13-16 YEARS, WHO WERE ATTENDING A 10-DAY YOGA TRAINING COURSE DURING SUMMER VACATION. THE SELECTED SUBJECTS HAD ENGLISH AS THEIR MEDIUM OF INSTRUCTION IN SCHOOL AND THEY ACTED AS THEIR OWN CONTROLS. THEY WERE ALLOCATED TO TWO GROUPS, AND TESTED ON THE DLST, IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND AFTER 22.5 MINUTES PRACTICE OF CM ON ONE DAY, AND IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND AFTER AN EQUAL PERIOD OF SR ON THE OTHER DAY. THE FIRST GROUP PERFORMED CM ON DAY 9 AND SR ON DAY 10. FOR THE SECOND GROUP, THE ORDER WAS REVERSED. RESULTS: WITHIN EACH GROUP PRE-POST TEST DIFFERENCES WERE SIGNIFICANT FOR BOTH THE RELAXATION TECHNIQUES. THE MAGNITUDE OF NET SCORE IMPROVEMENT WAS GREATER AFTER SR (7.85%) COMPARED TO CM (3.95%). SIGNIFICANCE LEVELS WERE P < 0.4 X 10(-9)FOR SR AND P < 0.1 X 10(-3) FOR CM. THE NUMBER OF WRONG ATTEMPTS ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY ON BOTH INTERVENTIONS, EVEN AFTER REMOVING TWO OUTLIER DATA POINTS ON DAY 1 IN THE SR GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: BOTH CM AND SR LEAD TO IMPROVEMENT IN PERFORMANCE ON THE DLST. HOWEVER, THESE RELAXATION TECHNIQUES LEAD TO MORE WRONG CANCELLATION ERRORS.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
4  869  18 EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY IN REVERSIBLE INGUINAL HERNIA: A QUASI EXPERIMENTAL STUDY. BACKGROUND: HERNIA IS AN ABNORMAL PROTRUSION OF AN ORGAN OR TISSUE THROUGH A DEFECT IN ITS SURROUNDING WALLS WHICH MOST COMMONLY INVOLVES THE ABDOMINAL WALL, PARTICULARLY THE INGUINAL REGION. THE TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR HERNIA RANGES FROM SIMPLE EXERCISES TO MODERN SURGERIES. THE EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY IS NOT SCIENTIFICALLY EXAMINED FOR REVERSIBLE INGUINAL HERNIA AND HENCE THIS STUDY IS UNDERTAKEN WITH THE AIM TO TEST THE EFFECT OF SELECTED ASANAS IN REVERSIBLE INGUINAL HERNIA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A QUASI EXPERIMENTAL TRAIL OF 19 MALES THROUGH CONSECUTIVE SAMPLING WAS DONE WITH SELECTED ASANAS FOR THREE MONTHS AND THE OUTCOME WAS MEASURED BY A QUESTIONNAIRE FOCUSING ON PAIN, AGGRAVATING FACTORS, RELIEVING FACTORS AND FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE OF SYMPTOMS OF HERNIA. RESULTS: THE PRE AND POST INTERVENTIONAL DATA WERE COMPARED STATISTICALLY AND FOUND SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF SYMPTOMS WITH P</=0.001 IN PAIN, FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE AND AGGRAVATING FACTORS. THE RELIEVING FACTORS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT INCREASE WITH P</=0.001. CONCLUSION: YOGA THERAPY WITH SELECTED ASANAS IS EFFECTIVE IN THE TREATMENT OF REVERSIBLE INGUINAL HERNIA.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
5  384  26 BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA LIFESTYLE ON REVERSIBILITY OF ISCHAEMIC HEART DISEASE: CARING HEART PROJECT OF INTERNATIONAL BOARD OF YOGA. OBJECTIVES: YOGA BASED LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN EARLIER SHOWN TO BE BENEFICIAL IN CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE IN A SMALL NUMBER OF PATIENTS. WE EVALUATED THE ROLE OF LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION BASED ON YOGA TECHNIQUES, STRESS MANAGEMENT AND DIETARY MODIFICATIONS IN RETARDATION OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE. METHODS: THIS PROSPECTIVE, CONTROLLED, OPEN TRIAL INCLUDED ANGIOGRAPHICALLY PROVEN CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE PATIENTS (71 PATIENTS IN STUDY GROUP AND 42 PATIENTS IN CONTROL GROUP). THEY WERE ASSESSED CLINICALLY, BY BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS, STRESS MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION AND FUNCTION STUDIES AND CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY AND ON PSYCHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS. THE STUDY GROUP PATIENTS WERE GIVEN A FAMILY BASED YOGA PROGRAMME WHICH INCLUDED, CONTROL OF RISK FACTORS, DIETARY MODIFICATIONS AND STRESS MANAGEMENT FOR A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR. THE PATIENTS WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE, AT FREQUENT INTERVALS AND AT THE END OF ONE YEAR. RESULTS: AT THE END OF ONE YEAR OF YOGA TRAINING, STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANT CHANGES (P<0.05) WERE FOUND IN SERUM TOTAL CHOLESTEROL (REDUCTION BY 23.3% IN STUDY GROUP PATIENTS AS COMPARED TO 4.4% IN CONTROLS); SERUM LDL CHOLESTEROL (REDUCTION OF 26% IN STUDY GROUP PATIENTS AS COMPARED TO 2.6% IN THE CONTROL GROUP), REGRESSION OF DISEASE (43.7% OF STUDY GROUP PATIENTS V/S 31% CONTROL GROUP ON MPI AND 70.4% OF STUDY GROUP V/S 28% OF CONTROL GROUP ON ANGIOGRAPHY) ARREST OF PROGRESSION (46.5% STUDY GROUP V/S 33.3% CONTROL GROUP ON MPI) AND PROGRESSION (9.9% OF STUDY GROUP VS 35.7% OF CONTROLS ON MPI, 29.6% OF STUDY GROUP V/S 60.0% OF CONTROLS ON ANGIOGRAPHY). AT THE END OF THE STUDY IMPROVEMENT IN ANXIETY SCORES WAS CONCORDANT WITH THE IMPROVEMENT SEEN IN THE MPI. NO UNTOWARD EFFECTS OF THE THERAPY WERE OBSERVED. CONCLUSION: YOGA BASED LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS HELP IN REGRESSION OF CORONARY LESIONS AND IN IMPROVING MYOCARDIAL PERFUSION. THIS IS TRANSLATED INTO CLINICAL BENEFITS AND SYMPTOMATIC IMPROVEMENT.	2004	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
6 2131  30 THE EFFECTS OF A 6-MONTH MODERATE-INTENSITY HATHA YOGA-BASED TRAINING PROGRAM ON HEALTH-RELATED FITNESS IN MIDDLE-AGED SEDENTARY WOMEN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. BACKGROUND: THERE IS PAUCITY OF DATA EXAMINING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LONG-TERM HATHA YOGA-BASED (HY) PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON THE HEALTH-RELATED FITNESS (H-RF) OF ASYMPTOMATIC, SEDENTARY WOMEN. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF A 6-MONTH HY-BASED TRAINING PROGRAM ON H-RF COMPONENTS IN SEDENTARY MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN. METHODS: EIGHTY SEDENTARY WOMEN WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED INTO EITHER THE HY GROUP (HYG) (N.=42) OR THE CONTROL GROUP (CG) (N.=38). THE 6-MONTH HYG PROGRAM INVOLVED A PROGRESSIVE SERIES OF VINYASA FLOW POSES PERFORMED 3 TIMES/WEEK FOR 60 MINUTES (40 MINUTES WITHIN THE EXERCISE ZONE OF 60-75% HR<INF>MAX</INF>). THE CG PARTICIPANTS DID NOT UNDERGO ANY PHYSICAL TRAINING OR EDUCATION. HEALTH-RELATED FITNESS PARAMETERS INCLUDED MEASURES OF PRE- AND POST-TRAINING: BODY COMPOSITION, MUSCULAR STRENGTH AND MAXIMAL VOLUNTARY ISOMETRIC TORQUES OF ELBOW FLEXORS AND KNEE EXTENSORS, CARDIO-RESPIRATORY FITNESS, LOWER BACK AND HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY AND A STATIC-DYNAMIC BALANCE. RESULTS: TWO-WAY MIXED DESIGN ANOVA REVEALED SIGNIFICANT MAIN EFFECTS FOR ALL THE INDICATORS OF H-RF. TUKEY POST-HOC TESTS CONFIRMED THAT THE HYG DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN EVERY VARIABLE TESTED. EXAMPLES OF THE BENEFITS ACHIEVED INCLUDE (ALL P<.001): AN AVERAGE LOSS OF 1.03 KG AND A 4.82% DECREASE IN BODY FAT, 14.6% AND 13.1% GAINS IN ISOMETRIC STRENGTH OF THE KNEE EXTENSORS AND ELBOW FLEXORS RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE IN RELATIVE VO<INF>2MAX</INF> OF 6.1% (33.12+/-5.30 TO 35.14+/-4.82 ML/KG/MIN), A 4-CM OR 10.4% INCREASE IN THEIR MSAR, AND AN AVERAGE IMPROVED BALANCE INDEX OF 5.6 MM/S. REVERSELY, THE CG SHOWED NON-SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN H-RF VARIABLES (ALL P>0.05; PERCENT RANGE FROM -1.4% TO 1.1%). CONCLUSIONS: BY PARTICIPATING IN A MODERATE-INTENSITY 6-MONTH HY-BASED TRAINING PROGRAM, MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THEIR HR-F STATUS. THE APPLICATION OF PROGRESSIVE TARGET HEART RATE GOALS FACILITATED GREATER THAN EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS IN CARDIO-RESPIRATORY FITNESS AND IMPROVEMENTS IN BODY COMPOSITION.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                             
7 1728  17 PERFORMANCE ON PSYCHOMOTOR TASKS FOLLOWING TWO YOGA-BASED RELAXATION TECHNIQUES. PREVIOUSLY CYCLIC MEDITATION AND SUPINE REST HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE IN A LETTER CANCELLATION TASK REQUIRING ATTENTION, VISUAL SCANNING, AND MOTOR SPEED. THE PRESENT STUDY ASSESSED THE PERFORMANCE IN 57 VOLUNTEERS (ALL MALE, M AGE = 26.5 YR., SD = 4.6) IN THREE TASKS, VIZ., A DIGIT-LETTER SUBSTITUTION TASK (DLST), A LETTER-COPYING TASK, AND A CIRCLE-DOTTING TASK. THE DLST ASSESSED ATTENTION AND SPEED OF INFORMATION PROCESSING, WHILE THE OTHER 2 TESTS ASSESSED MOTOR SPEED. EACH PARTICIPANT WAS ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER THREE TYPES OF SESSIONS: CYCLIC MEDITATION, SUPINE REST, AND CONTROL (NO INTERVENTION). DLST SCORES AND SCORES FOR LETTER-COPYING AND CIRCLE-DOTTING TASKS IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER CYCLIC MEDITATION; THE SAME SCORES ALSO IMPROVED AFTER SUPINE REST. THERE WAS NO CHANGE AFTER THE NO-INTERVENTION/CONTROL SESSION. FROM THE RESULTS IT WAS DIFFICULT TO CONCLUDE WHETHER IMPROVED DLST SCORES AFTER CYCLIC MEDITATION WERE DUE TO BETTER INFORMATION PROCESSING SPEED OR IMPROVED MOTOR SPEED.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
8 1357  18 IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF TWO YOGA-BASED RELAXATION TECHNIQUES ON PERFORMANCE IN A LETTER-CANCELLATION TASK. THE PERFORMANCE IN A SIX-LETTER CANCELLATION TASK WAS ASSESSED WITH 69 MALE VOLUNTEERS, AGES 18 TO 48 YEARS, IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND AFTER TWO YOGA-BASED RELAXATION TECHNIQUES AND A CONTROL SESSION OF EQUAL DURATION. THE TECHNIQUES WERE CYCLIC MEDITATION AND SUPINE REST. CYCLIC MEDITATION CONSISTS OF ALTERNATING CYCLES OF YOGA POSTURES AND SUPINE REST. AFTER BOTH PRACTICES, THE NET SCORES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER, ALTHOUGH THE MAGNITUDE OF CHANGE WAS MORE AFTER CYCLIC MEDITATION THAN AFTER SUPINE REST (24.9% VERSUS 13.6%). THERE WAS REDUCTION IN SCORES FOR WRONG CANCELLATIONS AFTER CYCLIC MEDITATION AND NOT AFTER SUPINE REST. THE CONTROL GROUP SHOWED NO CHANGE. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT CYCLIC MEDITATION BRINGS ABOUT A GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN PERFORMANCE IN THIS TASK, WHICH REQUIRES SELECTIVE ATTENTION, CONCENTRATION, VISUAL SCANNING ABILITIES, AND A REPETITIVE MOTOR RESPONSE.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
9  768  26 EFFECT OF TWO YOGA-BASED RELAXATION TECHNIQUES ON MEMORY SCORES AND STATE ANXIETY. BACKGROUND: A YOGA PRACTICE INVOLVING CYCLES OF YOGA POSTURES AND SUPINE REST (CALLED CYCLIC MEDITATION) WAS PREVIOUSLY SHOWN TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE IN ATTENTION TASKS MORE THAN RELAXATION IN THE CORPSE POSTURE (SHAVASANA). THIS WAS ASCRIBED TO REDUCED ANXIETY, THOUGH THIS WAS NOT ASSESSED. METHODS: IN FIFTY-SEVEN MALE VOLUNTEERS (GROUP AVERAGE AGE +/- S.D., 26.6 +/- 4.5 YEARS) THE IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF TWO YOGA RELAXATION TECHNIQUES WAS STUDIED ON MEMORY AND STATE ANXIETY. ALL PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER (I) CYCLIC MEDITATION (CM) PRACTICED FOR 22:30 MINUTES ON ONE DAY AND (II) AN EQUAL DURATION OF SUPINE REST (SR) OR THE CORPSE POSTURE (SHAVASANA), ON ANOTHER DAY. SECTIONS OF THE WECHSLER MEMORY SCALE (WMS) WERE USED TO ASSESS; (I) ATTENTION AND CONCENTRATION (DIGIT SPAN FORWARD AND BACKWARD), AND (II) ASSOCIATE LEARNING. STATE ANXIETY WAS ASSESSED USING SPIELBERGER'S STATE-TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY (STAI). RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE SCORES OF ALL SECTIONS OF THE WMS STUDIED AFTER BOTH CM AND SR, BUT, THE MAGNITUDE OF CHANGE WAS MORE AFTER CM COMPARED TO AFTER SR. THE STATE ANXIETY SCORES DECREASED AFTER BOTH CM AND SR, WITH A GREATER MAGNITUDE OF DECREASE AFTER CM. THERE WAS NO CORRELATION BETWEEN PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN MEMORY SCORES AND STATE ANXIETY FOR EITHER SESSION. CONCLUSION: A CYCLICAL COMBINATION OF YOGA POSTURES AND SUPINE REST IN CM IMPROVED MEMORY SCORES IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE PRACTICE AND DECREASED STATE ANXIETY MORE THAN REST IN A CLASSICAL YOGA RELAXATION POSTURE (SHAVASANA).	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
10  463  24 CHANGES IN SHAPE AND SIZE DISCRIMINATION AND STATE ANXIETY AFTER ALTERNATE-NOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING AND BREATH AWARENESS IN ONE SESSION EACH. BACKGROUND YOGA BREATHING TECHNIQUES LIKE HIGH-FREQUENCY YOGA BREATHING (HFYB) AND BREATH AWARENESS (BAW) HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED PERFORMANCE IN THE SHAPE AND SIZE DISCRIMINATION TASK. A PUBMED SEARCH OF THE LITERATURE REVEALED THAT ALTERNATE-NOSTRIL BREATHING HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE IN ATTENTION TASKS, BUT THE EFFECT ON TACTILE PERCEPTION HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED. HENCE, THE PRESENT STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO ASSESS THE IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF ALTERNATE-NOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING (ANYB) COMPARED TO BREATH AWARENESS ON SHAPE AND SIZE DISCRIMINATION AND STATE ANXIETY. MATERIAL AND METHODS FIFTY HEALTHY MALE VOLUNTEERS AGES 20-50 YEARS (GROUP MEAN +/-S.D., 28.4+/-8.2 YEARS) WERE RECRUITED. EACH PARTICIPANT WAS ASSESSED IN 3 SESSIONS CONDUCTED ON 3 SEPARATE DAYS AT THE SAME TIME OF DAY. THE 3 SESSIONS WERE (I) ALTERNATE-NOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING (ANYB), (II) BREATH AWARENESS (BAW), AND (III) QUIET SITTING (QS), AND THE SEQUENCE OF THE SESSIONS WAS RANDOMLY ALLOCATED. THE SHAPE AND SIZE DISCRIMINATION TASK AND STATE ANXIETY WERE ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER ALL 3 SESSIONS. REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (RM-ANOVA) FOLLOWED BY POST HOC TESTS FOR MULTIPLE COMPARISONS, WHICH WERE BONFERRONI-ADJUSTED, WERE PERFORMED TO COMPARE DATA BEFORE AND AFTER ALL 3 SESSIONS USING SPSS VERSION 18.0. RESULTS THE ERRORS SCORES IN THE SHAPE AND SIZE DISCRIMINATION TASK SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION AFTER THE ANYB SESSION (P<0.001). A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION WAS FOUND IN THE LEVEL OF STATE ANXIETY AFTER BREATH AWARENESS (P<0.05) AND QUIET SITTING SESSIONS (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS THE PRESENT RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ANYB: (I) IMPROVES PERFORMANCE IN A TASK WHICH REQUIRES PERCEPTUAL SENSITIVITY AND FOCUSED ATTENTION, BUT (II) DOES NOT REDUCE STATE ANXIETY FOLLOWING THIS TASK.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
11  992  18 EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA PRACTICE ON THE HEALTH-RELATED ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL FITNESS. TEN HEALTHY, UNTRAINED VOLUNTEERS (NINE FEMALES AND ONE MALE), RANGING IN AGE FROM 18-27 YEARS, WERE STUDIED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA PRACTICE ON THE HEALTH-RELATED ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL FITNESS, INCLUDING MUSCULAR STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE, FLEXIBILITY, CARDIORESPIRATORY FITNESS, BODY COMPOSITION, AND PULMONARY FUNCTION. SUBJECTS WERE REQUIRED TO ATTEND A MINIMUM OF TWO YOGA CLASSES PER WEEK FOR A TOTAL OF 8 WEEKS. EACH YOGA SESSION CONSISTED OF 10 MINUTES OF PRANAYAMAS (BREATH-CONTROL EXERCISES), 15 MINUTES OF DYNAMIC WARM-UP EXERCISES, 50 MINUTES OF ASANAS (YOGA POSTURES), AND 10 MINUTES OF SUPINE RELAXATION IN SAVASANA (CORPSE POSE). THE SUBJECTS WERE EVALUATED BEFORE AND AFTER THE 8-WEEK TRAINING PROGRAM. ISOKINETIC MUSCULAR STRENGTH FOR ELBOW EXTENSION, ELBOW FLEXION, AND KNEE EXTENSION INCREASED BY 31%, 19%, AND 28% (P<0.05), RESPECTIVELY, WHEREAS ISOMETRIC MUSCULAR ENDURANCE FOR KNEE FLEXION INCREASED 57% (P<0.01). ANKLE FLEXIBILITY, SHOULDER ELEVATION, TRUNK EXTENSION, AND TRUNK FLEXION INCREASED BY 13% (P<0.01), 155% (P<0.001), 188% (P<0.001), AND 14% (P<0.05), RESPECTIVELY. ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE MAXIMAL OXYGEN UPTAKE INCREASED BY 7% AND 6%, RESPECTIVELY (P<0.01). THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT REGULAR HATHA YOGA PRACTICE CAN ELICIT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE HEALTH-RELATED ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL FITNESS.

12  632  25 DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS OF ETHICAL EDUCATION, PHYSICAL HATHA YOGA, AND MANTRA MEDITATION ON WELL-BEING AND STRESS IN HEALTHY PARTICIPANTS-AN EXPERIMENTAL SINGLE-CASE STUDY. TRADITIONALLY, YOGA IS A MULTICOMPONENT PRACTICE CONSISTING OF POSTURES, BREATHING TECHNIQUES, MEDITATION, MANTRAS, AND ETHICS. TO DATE, ONLY A FEW STUDIES HAVE TRIED TO DISMANTLE THE EFFECTS OF EACH OF THESE COMPONENTS AND THEIR COMBINATIONS. TO FILL THIS GAP, WE EXAMINED THE INCREMENTAL EFFECTS OF ETHICAL EDUCATION AND PHYSICAL HATHA YOGA ON MANTRA MEDITATION USING A SINGLE-CASE MULTIPLE-BASELINE DESIGN. THIS STUDY WAS PART OF A PROJECT EVALUATING THE NEW MIND-BODY PROGRAM MEDITATION-BASED LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION. FIFTY-SEVEN HEALTHY PARTICIPANTS WITH NO REGULAR YOGA OR MEDITATION PRACTICE WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO THREE BASELINES (7, 14, AND 21 DAYS) AND FOUR CONDITIONS USING A RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR. THE CONDITIONS WERE MANTRA MEDITATION ALONE (MA), MEDITATION PLUS PHYSICAL YOGA (MY), MEDITATION PLUS ETHICAL EDUCATION (ME), AND MEDITATION PLUS YOGA AND ETHICAL EDUCATION (MYE). ALL THE INTERVENTIONS LASTED FOR 8 WEEKS AND WERE RUN CONSECUTIVELY ACCORDING TO BASELINE LENGTH. DURING THE BASELINE AND TREATMENT PHASES, PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED DAILY QUESTIONNAIRES MEASURING THEIR WELL-BEING (WHO-5 WELL-BEING INDEX), STRESS (PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE), AND SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCES. FORTY-TWO PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE TREATMENT AND WERE ENTERED IN THE ANALYSES. WE ANALYZED OUR DATA USING VISUAL INSPECTION, EFFECT SIZE ESTIMATION (TAU-U), AND MULTILEVEL MODELING. ALMOST ALL PARTICIPANTS SHOWED A LONGITUDINAL INCREASE IN WELL-BEING. REGARDING BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCES, PARTICIPANTS WHO RECEIVED ETHICAL EDUCATION EXHIBITED THE LARGEST INCREASES IN WELL-BEING (TAU-U = 0.30/0.23 FOR ME/MYE), FOLLOWED BY PARTICIPANTS IN THE MY CONDITION (TAU-U = 0.12). CONVERSELY, PARTICIPANTS IN THE MA CONDITION SHOWED NO CHANGE (TAU-U = 0.07). THERE WAS A TENDENCY FOR THE COMBINED TREATMENTS TO DECREASE STRESS. THIS TENDENCY WAS STRONGEST IN THE MY CONDITION (TAU-U = -0.40) AND REVERSED IN THE MA CONDITION (TAU-U = 0.17). THESE RESULTS EMPHASIZE THE INCREMENTAL AND DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS OF PRACTICING MEDITATION IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER PRACTICES FROM THE EIGHT-FOLD YOGA PATH. THIS APPROACH IS VALUABLE FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING THE MULTIFACETED PRACTICE OF YOGA. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION:WWW.CLINICALTRIALS.GOV, IDENTIFIER: NCT04252976.	2021	

13 1317  23 HEART RATE VARIABILITY CHANGES DURING HIGH FREQUENCY YOGA BREATHING AND BREATH AWARENESS. BACKGROUND: PRE AND POST COMPARISON AFTER ONE MINUTE OF HIGH FREQUENCY YOGA BREATHING (HFYB) SUGGESTED THAT THE HFYB MODIFIES THE AUTONOMIC STATUS BY INCREASING SYMPATHETIC MODULATION, BUT ITS EFFECT DURING THE PRACTICE WAS NOT ASSESSED. METHODS: THIRTY-EIGHT MALE VOLUNTEERS WITH GROUP AVERAGE AGE +/- S.D., 23.3 +/- 4.4 YEARS WERE EACH ASSESSED ON TWO SEPARATE DAYS IN TWO SESSIONS, (I) HFYB AND (II) BREATH AWARENESS. EACH SESSION WAS FOR 35 MINUTES, WITH 3 PERIODS, I.E., PRE (5 MINUTES), DURING HFYB OR BREATH AWARENESS (15 MINUTES) AND POST (5 MINUTES). RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN NN50, PNN50 AND THE MEAN RR INTERVAL DURING AND AFTER HFYB AND AFTER BREATH AWARENESS, COMPARED TO THE RESPECTIVE 'PRE' VALUES (P < 0.05) (REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA FOLLOWED BY POST-HOC ANALYSIS). THE LF POWER INCREASED AND HF POWER DECREASED DURING AND AFTER BREATH AWARENESS AND LF/HF RATIO INCREASED AFTER BREATH AWARENESS (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THERE WAS REDUCED PARASYMPATHETIC MODULATION DURING AND AFTER HFYB AND INCREASED SYMPATHETIC MODULATION WITH REDUCED PARASYMPATHETIC MODULATION DURING AND AFTER BREATH AWARENESS.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
14 1261  25 FINGER DEXTERITY AND VISUAL DISCRIMINATION FOLLOWING TWO YOGA BREATHING PRACTICES. BACKGROUND: PRACTICING YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE MOTOR FUNCTIONS AND ATTENTION. THOUGH ATTENTION IS REQUIRED FOR FINE MOTOR AND DISCRIMINATION TASKS, THE EFFECT OF YOGA BREATHING TECHNIQUES ON FINE MOTOR SKILLS AND VISUAL DISCRIMINATION HAS NOT BEEN ASSESSED. AIM: TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF YOGA BREATHING TECHNIQUES ON FINGER DEXTERITY AND VISUAL DISCRIMINATION. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE PRESENT STUDY CONSISTED OF ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY SUBJECTS WHO HAD ENROLLED FOR STRESS MANAGEMENT. THEY WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS, ONE GROUP PRACTICED HIGH FREQUENCY YOGA BREATHING WHILE THE OTHER GROUP PRACTICED BREATH AWARENESS. HIGH FREQUENCY YOGA BREATHING (KAPALABHATI, BREATH RATE 1.0 HZ) AND BREATH AWARENESS ARE TWO YOGA PRACTICES WHICH IMPROVE ATTENTION. THE IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF HIGH FREQUENCY YOGA BREATHING AND BREATH AWARENESS (I) WERE ASSESSED ON THE PERFORMANCE ON THE O'CONNOR FINGER DEXTERITY TASK AND (II) (IN) A SHAPE AND SIZE DISCRIMINATION TASK. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE FINGER DEXTERITY TASK BY 19% AFTER KAPALABHATI AND 9% AFTER BREATH AWARENESS (P<0.001 IN BOTH CASES, REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA AND POST-HOC ANALYSES). THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION (P<0.001) IN ERROR (41% AFTER KAPALABHATI AND 21% AFTER BREATH AWARENESS) AS WELL AS TIME TAKEN TO COMPLETE THE SHAPE AND SIZE DISCRIMINATION TEST (15% AFTER KAPALABHATI AND 15% AFTER BREATH AWARENESS; P<0.001) WAS ALSO OBSERVED. CONCLUSION: BOTH KAPALABAHATI AND BREATH AWARENESS CAN IMPROVE FINE MOTOR SKILLS AND VISUAL DISCRIMINATION, WITH A GREATER MAGNITUDE OF CHANGE AFTER KAPALABHATI.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
15 2333  23 TWELVE-MINUTE DAILY YOGA REGIMEN REVERSES OSTEOPOROTIC BONE LOSS. OBJECTIVE: ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SELECTED YOGA POSTURES IN RAISING BONE MINERAL DENSITY (BMD). METHODS: TEN-YEAR STUDY OF 741 INTERNET-RECRUITED VOLUNTEERS COMPARING PREYOGA BMD CHANGES WITH POSTYOGA BMD CHANGES. OUTCOME MEASURES: DUAL-ENERGY X-RAY ABSORPTIOMETRIC SCANS. OPTIONAL RADIOGRAPHS OF HIPS AND SPINE AND BONE QUALITY STUDY (7 TESLA). RESULTS: BONE MINERAL DENSITY IMPROVED IN SPINE, HIPS, AND FEMUR OF THE 227 MODERATELY AND FULLY COMPLIANT PATIENTS. MONTHLY GAIN IN BMD WAS SIGNIFICANT IN SPINE (0.0029 G/CM(2), P = .005) AND FEMUR (0.00022 G/CM(2), P = .053), BUT IN 1 COHORT, ALTHOUGH MEAN GAIN IN HIP BMD WAS 50%, LARGE INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES RAISED THE CONFIDENCE INTERVAL AND THE GAIN WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR TOTAL HIP (0.000357 G/CM(2)). NO YOGA-RELATED SERIOUS INJURIES WERE IMAGED OR REPORTED. BONE QUALITY APPEARED QUALITATIVELY IMPROVED IN YOGA PRACTITIONERS. CONCLUSION: YOGA APPEARS TO RAISE BMD IN THE SPINE AND THE FEMUR SAFELY.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
16 1965  37 SERIAL CASE REPORTING YOGA FOR IDIOPATHIC AND DEGENERATIVE SCOLIOSIS. BACKGROUND: NON-SURGICAL TECHNIQUES FOR TREATING SCOLIOSIS FREQUENTLY FOCUS ON REALIGNING THE SPINE, TYPICALLY BY MUSCULAR RELAXATION OR MUSCULAR OR LIGAMENTOUS STRETCHING. HOWEVER, SUCH TREATMENTS, WHICH INCLUDE PHYSICAL THERAPEUTIC, CHIROPRACTIC, AND BRACING TECHNIQUES, ARE INCONSISTENTLY SUPPORTED BY CURRENT EVIDENCE. IN THIS STUDY, WE ASSESS THE POSSIBLE BENEFITS OF ASYMMETRICAL STRENGTHENING OF TRUNCAL MUSCLES ON THE CONVEX SIDE OF THE SCOLIOTIC CURVE THROUGH A SINGLE YOGA POSE, THE SIDE PLANK POSE, IN IDIOPATHIC AND DEGENERATIVE SCOLIOSIS. METHODS: TWENTY-FIVE PATIENTS WITH IDIOPATHIC OR DEGENERATIVE SCOLIOSIS AND PRIMARY CURVES MEASURING 6 TO 120 DEGREES BY THE COBB METHOD HAD SPINAL RADIOGRAPHS AND WERE THEN TAUGHT THE SIDE PLANK POSE. AFTER 1 WEEK PERFORMING THE POSE WITH CONVEXITY DOWNWARD FOR 10 TO 20 SECONDS, THEY WERE INSTRUCTED TO MAINTAIN THE POSTURE ONCE DAILY FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE ON THAT ONE SIDE ONLY. A SECOND SERIES OF SPINAL RADIOGRAPHS WAS TAKEN 3 TO 22 MONTHS LATER. PRE- AND POST-YOGA COBB MEASUREMENTS WERE COMPARED. RESULTS: THE MEAN SELF-REPORTED PRACTICE OF THE YOGA POSE WAS 1.5 MINUTES PER DAY, 6.1 DAYS PER WEEK, FOR A MEAN FOLLOW-UP PERIOD OF 6.8 MONTHS. AMONG ALL PATIENTS, A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE COBB ANGLE OF THE PRIMARY SCOLIOTIC CURVE OF 32.0% WAS FOUND. AMONG 19 COMPLIANT PATIENTS, THE MEAN IMPROVEMENT ROSE TO 40.9%. IMPROVEMENTS DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY AMONG ADOLESCENT IDIOPATHIC AND DEGENERATIVE SUBTYPES (49.6% AND 38.4%, RESPECTIVELY). CONCLUSIONS: ASYMMETRICALLY STRENGTHENING THE CONVEX SIDE OF THE PRIMARY CURVE WITH DAILY PRACTICE OF THE SIDE PLANK POSE HELD FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE FOR AN AVERAGE OF 6.8 MONTHS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE ANGLE OF PRIMARY SCOLIOTIC CURVES. THESE RESULTS WARRANT FURTHER TESTING.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
17 1355  18 IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF TWO YOGA-BASED RELAXATION TECHNIQUES ON ATTENTION IN CHILDREN. AIMS: TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF TWO YOGA-BASED RELAXATION TECHNIQUES, NAMELY, CYCLIC MEDITATION (CM) AND SUPINE REST (SR), USING THE SIX LETTER CANCELLATION TASK (SLCT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE SUBJECTS CONSISTED OF 208 SCHOOL STUDENTS, (132 BOYS, 76 GIRLS) IN THE AGE RANGE OF 13 - 16 YEARS. THE SUBJECTS WERE ASSESSED ON SLCT BEFORE AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER BOTH YOGA-BASED RELAXATION TECHNIQUES. RESULTS: AFTER BOTH PRACTICES, THE TOTAL AND NET SCORES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED, ALTHOUGH THE MAGNITUDE OF CHANGE WAS MORE AFTER CM THAN AFTER SR IN THE NET SCORES (14.5 VERSUS 11.31%). THE NET SCORE CHANGE IN THE CM SESSION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER THAN THE CHANGE IN THE SR, WHEREAS, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE WRONG CANCELLATION SCORE. AFTER EITHER PRACTICE, THE TOTAL AND NET SCORES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED, IRRESPECTIVE OF GENDER AND AGE. CONCLUSIONS: BOTH CM AND SR LED TO IMPROVEMENT IN PERFORMANCE, AS ASSESSED BY SLCT, BUT THE CHANGE CAUSED BY CM WAS LARGER THAN SR.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
18 1882  14 REDUCING ALLOSTATIC LOAD IN DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY DISORDERS: PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND YOGA PRACTICE AS ADD-ON THERAPIES. THE ALLOSTATIC LOAD (AL) INDEX CONSTITUTES A USEFUL TOOL TO OBJECTIVELY ASSESS THE BIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF CHRONIC STRESS IN CLINICAL PRACTICE. AL INDEX HAS BEEN POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH CUMULATIVE CHRONIC STRESS (PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESSORS) AND WITH A HIGH RISK TO DEVELOP PATHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS (E.G., METABOLIC SYNDROME, CARDIOVASCULAR PATHOLOGY, INFLAMMATORY DISORDERS) AND THE SO-CALLED STRESS-RELATED PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS, INCLUDING ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS. CHRONIC STRESS HAS NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON BRAIN NEUROPLASTICITY, ESPECIALLY ON HIPPOCAMPAL NEUROGENESIS AND THESE EFFECTS MAY BE REVERSED BY ANTIDEPRESSANT TREATMENTS. SEVERAL EVIDENCES INDICATE THAT NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS BASED ON PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND YOGA PRACTICE MAY ADD SYNERGIZING BENEFITS TO CLASSICAL TREATMENTS (ANTIDEPRESSANT AND BENZODIAZEPINES) FOR DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, REDUCING THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF CHRONIC STRESS. THE AIM OF THIS REVIEW IS TO PROVIDE A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON AL AND CHRONIC STRESS IN RELATION TO DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND YOGA PRACTICE.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
19 1691  12 OXYGEN CONSUMPTION AND RESPIRATION DURING AND AFTER TWO YOGA RELAXATION TECHNIQUES. CYCLIC MEDITATION (CM) IS A TECHNIQUE WHICH COMBINES "STIMULATING" AND "CALMING" PRACTICES, BASED ON A STATEMENT IN ANCIENT YOGA TEXTS SUGGESTING THAT SUCH A COMBINATION MAY BE ESPECIALLY HELPFUL TO REACH A STATE OF MENTAL EQUILIBRIUM. THE OXYGEN CONSUMPTION, BREATH RATE AND BREATH VOLUME OF 50 MALE VOLUNTEERS (GROUP MEAN AGE+/-SD, 27+/-6.3 YEARS) WERE ASSESSED BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER SESSIONS OF CM AND SESSIONS OF SUPINE REST IN THE CORPSE POSTURE (SHAVASANA, SH). THE SESSIONS WERE ONE DAY APART AND THE ORDER WAS ALTERNATED. THE OXYGEN CONSUMPTION, BREATH RATE AND BREATH VOLUME INCREASED DURING THE "STIMULATING" PRACTICES OF CM, RETURNED TO THE BASELINE DURING THE "CALMING" PRACTICES, AND THE OXYGEN CONSUMPTION DECREASED BY 19.3 PERCENT BELOW BASELINE VALUES AFTER CM. DURING THE SH SESSION THE OXYGEN CONSUMPTION, BREATH RATE AND BREATH VOLUME REDUCED; HOWEVER THE DECREASE IN OXYGEN CONSUMPTION AFTER SH WAS LESS THAN AFTER CM (I.E., 4.8 PERCENT). THE RESULTS SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT A COMBINATION OF YOGA POSTURES WITH SUPINE REST (IN CM) REDUCES THE OXYGEN CONSUMPTION MORE THAN RESTING SUPINE ALONE DOES.	2006	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
20 1147  23 ENERGY EXPENDITURE DURING A VINYASA YOGA SESSION. BACKGROUND: VINYASA YOGA HAS BEEN RECENTLY PROMOTED AS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR MINDFUL EXERCISES TO IMPROVE OVERALL HEALTH, INCLUDING BODY WEIGHT MANAGEMENT. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE METABOLIC RESPONSE OF 24 MODERATELY TRAINED INDIVIDUALS DURING A 90-MIN GROUP VINYASA YOGA ROUTINE. METHODS: HEART RATE (HR) TIME COURSE OF 12 MALES AND 12 FEMALES (AGE: 39+/-7.33 YEARS) WAS RECORDED DURING TWO GROUP VINYASA YOGA SESSIONS CONSISTED OF FOUR SECTIONS (WARM-UP, HIGH-INTENSITY SURYA NAMASKAR (HSN), NO SURYA NAMASKAR POSTURES, AND COOL-DOWN). MAXIMAL OXYGEN UPTAKE (VO<INF>2PEAK</INF>) AND MAXIMUM HR HAD BEEN ESTIMATED EARLIER AFTER A MAXIMAL TREADMILL TEST. VO<INF>2</INF> DURING VINYASA YOGA SESSIONS WAS ESTIMATED FROM INDIVIDUAL REGRESSION EQUATIONS USING THE RELATIONSHIP OF VO<INF>2</INF> AND HR VALUES DERIVED FROM VO<INF>2PEAK</INF> TEST, WHILE THE METABOLIC RATE (KCAL/MIN) WAS CALCULATED FROM THE RELATIONSHIP OF HR AND KCAL/MIN. TOTAL SESSION ENERGY CONSUMPTION WAS THE AVERAGE VALUE OF THE TWO YOGA SESSIONS. RESULTS: THE 2 (GENDER) X 4 (SECTIONS) MIXED ANOVA REVEALED NO SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION BETWEEN THE TWO FACTORS (P=0.101) FOR THE MEAN METABOLIC RATE (7.1+/-2.6 KCAL/MIN). MEAN METABOLIC RATE THOUGHT WAS HIGHER (P=0.015) IN MALES COMPARED TO FEMALES AT EACH SECTION. ALSO, SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND AMONG THE FOUR VINYASA YOGA SECTIONS (P<0.001) IN THE RATE OF ENERGY EXPENDITURE, WITH HSN PRESENTING THE HIGHEST MEAN VALUES (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: IT SEEMS THAT SYSTEMATIC PARTICIPATION IN VINYASA YOGA MAY EFFECTIVELY IMPROVE CARDIORESPIRATORY FITNESS AND PROMOTE BODY WEIGHT LOSS, AS AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD TO TRADITIONAL AEROBIC EXERCISE.	2020

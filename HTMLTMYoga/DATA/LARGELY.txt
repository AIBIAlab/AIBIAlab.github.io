1 1890 111 REGULATION OF GENE EXPRESSION BY YOGA, MEDITATION AND RELATED PRACTICES: A REVIEW OF RECENT STUDIES. INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE (IM) APPROACHES HAVE GAINED SIGNIFICANT INTEREST IN RECENT YEARS TO PROVIDE A SOLUTION FOR THE HEALTH CARE CHALLENGES WE FACE TODAY. YOGIC COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL PRACTICES ARE AMONG THE MOST WIDELY USED IM APPROACHES AND INCLUDE DIVERSE PRACTICES SUCH AS YOGA ASANAS, MEDITATION, BREATHING EXERCISES, QI GONG, TAI CHI CHIH, AND VARIOUS OTHERS. STUDIES TO DATE SUGGEST THAT THESE YOGIC/MEDITATIVE PRACTICES HAVE SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECTS ON THE MIND-BODY SYSTEM AND THEREBY CAN INCREASE WELLNESS AND SUPPORT THE HEALING PROCESS FROM DISEASE. PREVIOUS WORK HAS PROVIDED EVIDENCE FOR BOTH PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF THESE PRACTICES; HOWEVER, THE MECHANISMS OF THESE EFFECTS, ESPECIALLY AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL, HAVE LARGELY BEEN MISSING. THREE RECENT STUDIES STARTED TO PROVIDE SOME OF THIS INFORMATION THROUGH GENE EXPRESSION PROFILING IN CIRCULATING IMMUNE CELLS, WHICH SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT YOGIC/MEDITATIVE PRACTICES HAVE A MEASURABLE EFFECT AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL. THESE STUDIES ARE REVIEWED HEREIN AND SOME FUTURE PERSPECTIVES ARE CONSIDERED.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
2 2827  34 YOGA VERSUS NON-STANDARD CARE FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS AN ANCIENT SPIRITUAL PRACTICE THAT ORIGINATED IN INDIA AND IS CURRENTLY ACCEPTED IN THE WESTERN WORLD AS A FORM OF RELAXATION AND EXERCISE. IT HAS BEEN OF INTEREST FOR PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA AS AN ALTERNATIVE OR ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT. OBJECTIVES: TO SYSTEMATICALLY ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA VERSUS NON-STANDARD CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA. SEARCH METHODS: THE INFORMATION SPECIALIST OF THE COCHRANE SCHIZOPHRENIA GROUP SEARCHED THEIR SPECIALISED TRIALS REGISTER (LATEST 30 MARCH 2017), WHICH IS BASED ON REGULAR SEARCHES OF MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PSYCINFO, AND REGISTRIES OF CLINICAL TRIALS. WE SEARCHED THE REFERENCES OF ALL INCLUDED STUDIES. THERE ARE NO LANGUAGE, DATE, DOCUMENT TYPE, OR PUBLICATION STATUS LIMITATIONS FOR INCLUSION OF RECORDS IN THE REGISTER. SELECTION CRITERIA: ALL RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) INCLUDING PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA AND COMPARING YOGA WITH NON-STANDARD CARE. WE INCLUDED TRIALS THAT MET OUR SELECTION CRITERIA AND REPORTED USEABLE DATA. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: THE REVIEW TEAM INDEPENDENTLY SELECTED STUDIES, ASSESSED QUALITY, AND EXTRACTED DATA. FOR BINARY OUTCOMES, WE CALCULATED RISK RATIO (RR) AND ITS 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI), ON AN INTENTION-TO-TREAT BASIS. FOR CONTINUOUS DATA, WE ESTIMATED THE MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) BETWEEN GROUPS AND ITS 95% CI. WE EMPLOYED A FIXED-EFFECT MODELS FOR ANALYSES. WE EXAMINED DATA FOR HETEROGENEITY (I(2) TECHNIQUE), ASSESSED RISK OF BIAS FOR INCLUDED STUDIES, AND CREATED A 'SUMMARY OF FINDINGS' TABLE FOR SEVEN MAIN OUTCOMES OF INTEREST USING GRADE (GRADING OF RECOMMENDATIONS ASSESSMENT, DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION). MAIN RESULTS: WE WERE ABLE TO INCLUDE SIX STUDIES (586 PARTICIPANTS). NON-STANDARD CARE CONSISTED SOLELY OF ANOTHER TYPE OF EXERCISE PROGRAMME. ALL OUTCOMES WERE SHORT TERM (LESS THAN SIX MONTHS). THERE WAS A CLEAR DIFFERENCE IN THE OUTCOME LEAVING THE STUDY EARLY (6 RCTS, N=586, RR 0.64 CI 0.49 TO 0.83, MEDIUM QUALITY EVIDENCE) IN FAVOUR OF THE YOGA GROUP. THERE WERE NO CLEAR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS FOR THE REMAINING OUTCOMES. THESE INCLUDED MENTAL STATE (IMPROVEMENT IN POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SYNDROME SCALE, 1 RCT, N=84, RR 0.81 CI 0.62 TO 1.07, LOW QUALITY EVIDENCE), SOCIAL FUNCTIONING (IMPROVEMENT IN SOCIAL OCCUPATIONAL FUNCTIONING SCALE, 1 RCT, N=84, RR 0.90 CI 0.78 TO 1.04, LOW QUALITY EVIDENCE), QUALITY OF LIFE (MENTAL HEALTH) (AVERAGE CHANGE 36-ITEM SHORT FORM SURVEY (SF-36) QUALITY-OF-LIFE SUB-SCALE, 1 RCT, N=69, MD -5.30 CI -17.78 TO 7.18, LOW QUALITY EVIDENCE), PHYSICAL HEALTH, (AVERAGE CHANGE WHOQOL-BREF PHYSICAL-HEALTH SUB-SCALE, 1 RCT, N=69, MD 9.22 CI -0.42 TO 18.86, LOW QUALITY EVIDENCE). ONLY ONE STUDY REPORTED ADVERSE EFFECTS, FINDING NO INCIDENCE OF ADVERSE EVENTS IN EITHER TREATMENT GROUP. THERE WERE A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF MISSING OUTCOMES, WHICH INCLUDED RELAPSE, CHANGE IN COGNITION, COSTS OF CARE, EFFECT ON STANDARD CARE, SERVICE INTERVENTION, DISABILITY, AND ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: WE FOUND MINIMAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN YOGA AND NON-STANDARD CARE, THE LATTER CONSISTING OF ANOTHER EXERCISE COMPARATOR, WHICH COULD BE BROADLY CONSIDERED AEROBIC EXERCISE. OUTCOMES WERE LARGELY BASED ON SINGLE STUDIES WITH LIMITED SAMPLE SIZES AND SHORT-TERM FOLLOW-UP. OVERALL, MANY OUTCOMES WERE NOT REPORTED AND EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN THIS REVIEW IS OF LOW TO MODERATE QUALITY - TOO WEAK TO INDICATE THAT YOGA IS SUPERIOR OR INFERIOR TO NON-STANDARD CARE CONTROL FOR MANAGEMENT OF PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA.	2017	

3 2829  32 YOGA VERSUS STANDARD CARE FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS AN ANCIENT SPIRITUAL PRACTICE THAT ORIGINATED IN INDIA AND IS CURRENTLY ACCEPTED IN THE WESTERN WORLD AS A FORM OF RELAXATION AND EXERCISE. IT HAS BEEN OF INTEREST FOR PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA TO DETERMINE ITS EFFICACY AS AN ADJUNCT TO STANDARD-CARE TREATMENT. OBJECTIVES: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA VERSUS STANDARD CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA. SEARCH METHODS: WE SEARCHED THE COCHRANE SCHIZOPHRENIA GROUP TRIALS REGISTER (NOVEMBER 2012 AND JANUARY 29, 2015), WHICH IS BASED ON REGULAR SEARCHES OF MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PSYCINFO, AND REGISTRIES OF CLINICAL TRIALS. WE SEARCHED THE REFERENCES OF ALL INCLUDED STUDIES. THERE WERE NO LANGUAGE, DATE, DOCUMENT TYPE, OR PUBLICATION STATUS LIMITATIONS FOR INCLUSION OF RECORDS IN THE REGISTER. SELECTION CRITERIA: ALL RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) INCLUDING PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA COMPARING YOGA TO STANDARD-CARE CONTROL. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: THE REVIEW TEAM INDEPENDENTLY SELECTED STUDIES, QUALITY RATED THESE, AND EXTRACTED DATA. FOR BINARY OUTCOMES, WE CALCULATED RISK RATIO (RR) AND ITS 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI), ON AN INTENTION-TO-TREAT BASIS. FOR CONTINUOUS DATA, WE ESTIMATED THE MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) BETWEEN GROUPS AND ITS 95% CI. WE EMPLOYED MIXED-EFFECT AND FIXED-EFFECT MODELS FOR ANALYSES. WE EXAMINED DATA FOR HETEROGENEITY (I(2) TECHNIQUE), ASSESSED RISK OF BIAS FOR INCLUDED STUDIES, AND CREATED 'SUMMARY OF FINDINGS' TABLES USING GRADE (GRADING OF RECOMMENDATIONS ASSESSMENT, DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION). MAIN RESULTS: WE INCLUDED EIGHT STUDIES IN THE REVIEW. ALL OUTCOMES WERE SHORT TERM (LESS THAN SIX MONTHS). THERE WERE CLEAR DIFFERENCES IN A NUMBER OF OUTCOMES IN FAVOUR OF THE YOGA GROUP, ALTHOUGH THESE WERE BASED ON ONE STUDY EACH, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF LEAVING THE STUDY EARLY. THESE INCLUDED MENTAL STATE (IMPROVEMENT IN POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SYNDROME SCALE, 1 RCT, N = 83, RR 0.70 CI 0.55 TO 0.88, MEDIUM-QUALITY EVIDENCE), SOCIAL FUNCTIONING (IMPROVEMENT IN SOCIAL OCCUPATIONAL FUNCTIONING SCALE, 1 RCT, N = 83, RR 0.88 CI 0.77 TO 1, MEDIUM-QUALITY EVIDENCE), QUALITY OF LIFE (AVERAGE CHANGE 36-ITEM SHORT FORM SURVEY (SF-36) QUALITY-OF-LIFE SUBSCALE, 1 RCT, N = 60, MD 15.50, 95% CI 4.27 TO 26.73, LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE), AND LEAVING THE STUDY EARLY (8 RCTS, N = 457, RR 0.91 CI 0.6 TO 1.37, MEDIUM-QUALITY EVIDENCE). FOR THE OUTCOME OF PHYSICAL HEALTH, THERE WAS NOT A CLEAR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS (AVERAGE CHANGE SF-36 PHYSICAL-HEALTH SUBSCALE, 1 RCT, N = 60, MD 6.60, 95% CI -2.44 TO 15.64, LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE). ONLY ONE STUDY REPORTED ADVERSE EFFECTS, FINDING NO INCIDENCE OF ADVERSE EVENTS IN EITHER TREATMENT GROUP. THIS REVIEW WAS SUBJECT TO A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF MISSING OUTCOMES, WHICH INCLUDED GLOBAL STATE, CHANGE IN COGNITION, COSTS OF CARE, EFFECT ON STANDARD CARE, SERVICE INTERVENTION, DISABILITY, AND ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: EVEN THOUGH WE FOUND SOME POSITIVE EVIDENCE IN FAVOUR OF YOGA OVER STANDARD-CARE CONTROL, THIS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED CAUTIOUSLY IN VIEW OF OUTCOMES LARGELY BASED EACH ON ONE STUDY WITH LIMITED SAMPLE SIZES AND SHORT-TERM FOLLOW-UP. OVERALL, MANY OUTCOMES WERE NOT REPORTED AND EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN THIS REVIEW IS OF LOW TO MODERATE QUALITY - -TOO WEAK TO INDICATE THAT YOGA IS SUPERIOR TO STANDARD-CARE CONTROL FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                               
4 2497  30 YOGA AS PART OF A PACKAGE OF CARE VERSUS STANDARD CARE FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS AN ANCIENT SPIRITUAL PRACTICE THAT ORIGINATED IN INDIA AND IS CURRENTLY ACCEPTED IN THE WESTERN WORLD AS A FORM OF RELAXATION AND EXERCISE. IT HAS BEEN OF INTEREST FOR PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA DELIVERED AS A PACKAGE OF CARE VERSUS STANDARD CARE. OBJECTIVES: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AS A PACKAGE OF CARE VERSUS STANDARD CARE. SEARCH METHODS: WE SEARCHED THE COCHRANE SCHIZOPHRENIA GROUP TRIALS REGISTER (LATEST 30 MARCH 2017) WHICH IS BASED ON REGULAR SEARCHES OF MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE, CINAHL, BIOSS, AMED, PSYCHINFO, AND REGISTRIES OF CLINICAL TRIALS. WE SEARCHED THE REFERENCES OF ALL INCLUDED STUDIES. THERE ARE NO LANGUAGE, DATE, DOCUMENT TYPE, OR PUBLICATION STATUS LIMITATIONS FOR INCLUSION OF RECORDS IN THE REGISTER. SELECTION CRITERIA: ALL RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) INCLUDING PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA COMPARING YOGA AS A PACKAGE OF CARE WITH STANDARD-CARE CONTROL. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: THE REVIEW AUTHORS INDEPENDENTLY SELECTED STUDIES, QUALITY RATED THESE, AND EXTRACTED DATA. FOR BINARY OUTCOMES, WE CALCULATED RISK DIFFERENCE (RD) AND ITS 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI), ON AN INTENTION-TO-TREAT (ITT) BASIS. FOR CONTINUOUS DATA, WE ESTIMATED THE MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) BETWEEN GROUPS AND ITS CI. WE EMPLOYED MIXED-EFFECT AND FIXED-EFFECT MODELS FOR ANALYSIS. WE EXAMINED HETEROGENEITY (I(2) TECHNIQUE), ASSESSED RISK OF BIAS FOR INCLUDED STUDIES, AND CREATED A 'SUMMARY OF FINDINGS' TABLE USING GRADE (GRADING OF RECOMMENDATIONS ASSESSMENT, DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION). MAIN RESULTS: THREE STUDIES ARE INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW. ALL OUTCOMES WERE SHORT TERM (LESS THAN EIGHT WEEKS). USEABLE DATA WERE REPORTED FOR TWO OUTCOMES ONLY; LEAVING THE STUDY EARLY AND QUALITY OF LIFE. NONE OF THE PARTICIPANTS LEFT THE STUDIES EARLY AND THERE WAS SOME EVIDENCE IN FAVOUR OF THE YOGA PACKAGE FOR QUALITY OF LIFE ENDPOINT SCORES (1 RCT, N=80, MD 22.93 CI 19.74 TO 26.12, LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE). LEAVING THE STUDY EARLY DATA WERE EQUIVOCAL BETWEEN THE TREATMENT GROUPS (3 RCTS, N=193, RD 0.06 CI -0.01 TO 0.13, MEDIUM-QUALITY EVIDENCE, HIGH HETEROGENEITY). OVERALL, THIS REVIEW HAS AN INORDINATE NUMBER OF MISSING KEY OUTCOMES, WHICH INCLUDED MENTAL AND GLOBAL STATE, SOCIAL FUNCTIONING, PHYSICAL HEALTH, ADVERSE EFFECTS AND COSTS OF CARE. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: A SMALL NUMBER OF SMALL STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW AND THESE LACKED MANY KEY OUTCOMES. THE SPARSE DATA MEANS WE CANNOT STATE WITH ANY DEGREE OF CERTAINTY IF YOGA DELIVERED AS A PACKAGE OF CARE IS BENEFICIAL IN COMPARISON TO STANDARD CARE.	2017

AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: IN VIEW OF THE LACK OF EVIDENCE FROM RCTS, IT IS CURRENTLY NOT POSSIBLE FOR US TO COMMENT ON THE USE OF YOGA AS PART OF A PACKAGE OF CARE VERSUS NON-STANDARD CARE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
6   93  37 A NARRATIVE REVIEW OF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS AS COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES FOR ADDICTION. THIS PAPER REVIEWS THE PHILOSOPHICAL ORIGINS, CURRENT SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE, AND CLINICAL PROMISE OF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS AS COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES FOR ADDICTION. HISTORICALLY, THERE ARE EIGHT ELEMENTS OF YOGA THAT, TOGETHER, COMPRISE ETHICAL PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES FOR LIVING A MEANINGFUL, PURPOSEFUL, MORAL AND SELF-DISCIPLINED LIFE. TRADITIONAL YOGA PRACTICES, INCLUDING POSTURES AND MEDITATION, DIRECT ATTENTION TOWARD ONE'S HEALTH, WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THE SPIRITUAL ASPECTS OF ONE'S NATURE. MINDFULNESS DERIVES FROM ANCIENT BUDDHIST PHILOSOPHY, AND MINDFULNESS MEDITATION PRACTICES, SUCH AS GENTLE HATHA YOGA AND MINDFUL BREATHING, ARE INCREASINGLY INTEGRATED INTO SECULAR HEALTH CARE SETTINGS. CURRENT THEORETICAL MODELS SUGGEST THAT THE SKILLS, INSIGHTS, AND SELF-AWARENESS LEARNED THROUGH YOGA AND MINDFULNESS PRACTICE CAN TARGET MULTIPLE PSYCHOLOGICAL, NEURAL, PHYSIOLOGICAL, AND BEHAVIORAL PROCESSES IMPLICATED IN ADDICTION AND RELAPSE. A SMALL BUT GROWING NUMBER OF WELL-DESIGNED CLINICAL TRIALS AND EXPERIMENTAL LABORATORY STUDIES ON SMOKING, ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE, AND ILLICIT SUBSTANCE USE SUPPORT THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS AND HYPOTHESIZED MECHANISMS OF ACTION UNDERLYING MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR TREATING ADDICTION. BECAUSE VERY FEW STUDIES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED ON THE SPECIFIC ROLE OF YOGA IN TREATING OR PREVENTING ADDICTION, WE PROPOSE A CONCEPTUAL MODEL TO INFORM FUTURE STUDIES ON OUTCOMES AND POSSIBLE MECHANISMS. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS ALSO NEEDED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT TYPES OF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS WORK BEST FOR WHAT TYPES OF ADDICTION, WHAT TYPES OF PATIENTS, AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. OVERALL, CURRENT FINDINGS INCREASINGLY SUPPORT YOGA AND MINDFULNESS AS PROMISING COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES FOR TREATING AND PREVENTING ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
7 2282  36 THE THERAPEUTIC VALUE OF YOGA IN NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS. BACKGROUND: THE ANCIENT MIND AND BODY HEALING METHODS OF YOGA RECENTLY SPARKED FERVOR IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AS AN ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEANS OF THERAPY. SINCE THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION OFFICIALLY BEGAN PROMOTING YOGA IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IN 1978, YOGA HAS BEEN CITED FOR ITS THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL AND HAS BEEN WIDELY RECOGNIZED IN WESTERN CULTURE. HOWEVER, AS AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PEOPLE PRACTICE YOGA FOR REMEDIAL PURPOSES, RESEARCHERS RAISE TWO IMPORTANT QUESTIONS: 1) IS YOGA A VALID COMPLEMENTARY MANAGEMENT AND REHABILITATION TREATMENT MODALITY? 2) WHAT CONDITIONS SHOW PROMISE OF TREATMENT WITH THIS INTERVENTION?. OBJECTIVE: THIS REVIEW ARTICLE USES COMPREHENSIVE SCIENTIFIC, EVIDENCE-BASED STUDIES TO ANALYZE THE EFFICACY OF VARIOUS BASIC AND APPLIED ASPECTS OF YOGA IN DISEASE PREVENTION AND HEALTH PROMOTION. IT SPECIFICALLY INTENDS TO EXPOSE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS, PARTICULARLY EPILEPSY, STROKE, MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE, PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISEASE, AND FIBROMYALGIA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: INFORMATION WAS GATHERED FROM VARIOUS RESOURCES INCLUDING PUBMED, OVID, MD-CONSULT, USC, AND U.C.L.A. LIBRARIES. STUDIES WERE SELECTED AND REVIEWED ON THE BASIS OF SAMPLE SIZE, CONTROL, RANDOMIZATION, DOUBLE-BLINDING, AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF RESULTS. RESULTS: THE PRATICE OF YOGA AND MEDITATION DEMONSTRATES STATISTICALLY ENCOURAGING PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS IN THE AFOREMENTIONED NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS. HOWEVER, THERE WERE CERTAIN FLAWS AND INADEQUACIES IN THE STUDY DESIGNS EMPLOYED TO EVALUATE THE SAME. A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THESE STUDIES IS PRESENTED. CONCLUSIONS: WITH THE AIM TO FOCUS ATTENTION ON THIS WIDESPREAD YET LARGELY UNEXAMINED TREATMENT MODALITY, THIS PAPER SEEKS TO PROVIDE DIRECTION AND SUPPORT FOR FURTHER RESEARCH NECESSARY TO VALIDATE YOGA AS AN INTEGRATIVE, ALTERNATIVE, AND COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
8  226  33 A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMISED CONTROL TRIALS ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS MEASURES AND MOOD. STRESS RELATED DISORDERS SUCH AS DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY ARE LEADING SOURCES OF DISABILITY WORLDWIDE, AND CURRENT TREATMENT METHODS SUCH AS CONVENTIONAL ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATIONS ARE NOT BENEFICIAL FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT YOGA HAS MOOD-ENHANCING PROPERTIES POSSIBLY RELATED TO ITS INHIBITORY EFFECTS ON PHYSIOLOGICAL STRESS AND INFLAMMATION, WHICH ARE FREQUENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH AFFECTIVE DISORDERS. HOWEVER THE BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS VIA WHICH YOGA EXERTS ITS THERAPEUTIC MOOD-MODULATING EFFECTS ARE LARGELY UNKNOWN. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW INVESTIGATES THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND HYPOTHALAMIC PITUITARY ADRENAL AXIS REGULATION MEASURES. IT FOCUSES ON STUDIES COLLECTING PHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS SUCH AS BLOOD PRESSURE, HEART RATE, CORTISOL, PERIPHERAL CYTOKINE EXPRESSION AND/OR STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL BRAIN MEASURES IN REGIONS INVOLVED IN STRESS AND MOOD REGULATION. OVERALL THE 25 RANDOMISED CONTROL STUDIES DISCUSSED PROVIDE PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT YOGA PRACTICE LEADS TO BETTER REGULATION OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-ADRENAL SYSTEM, AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN DEPRESSIVE AND ANXIOUS SYMPTOMS IN A RANGE OF POPULATIONS. FURTHER RESEARCH IS WARRANTED TO CONFIRM THESE PRELIMINARY FINDINGS AND FACILITATE IMPLEMENTATION IN CLINICAL SETTINGS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
9 1894  44 RESEARCH TRENDS IN THE APPLICATION OF YOGA TO HUMAN HEALTH: A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH. YOGA IS AN INTEGRATIVE MIND-BODY SYSTEM OF WELLBEING DEVELOPED IN INDIA SINCE AT LEAST THREE MILLENNIA. YOGA HAS GAINED CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION IN RECENT DECADES, PARTLY DRIVEN BY RECENT RESEARCH AND EVIDENCE ABOUT ITS EFFECTIVENESS. IN THIS WORK, WE EXTRACTED RESEARCH TRENDS ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON HUMAN HEALTH FROM THE US NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE'S PUBMED DATABASE (PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL PAPERS). WE FOUND THAT YOGA RESEARCH SPANS ALL ORGAN SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM-WIDE ISSUES SUCH AS PAIN AND CANCER. RESEARCH ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM FAR OUTPACES OTHER SYSTEMS, WHICH IS EXPECTED BECAUSE OF THE EFFECTS OF BREATHING AND EXERCISE ON STRESS REDUCTION, WHICH HAS BEEN A MAJOR APPLICATION OF YOGA. THE NEXT CLUSTER OF IMPACT CONCERNS THE MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM AND PAIN (BOTH RELATED TO THE EXERCISE [ASANA] ASPECTS OF YOGA), AS WELL AS CARDIOVASCULAR/ENDOCRINE (ALSO RELATED TO STRESS) AND CANCER. STRESS AND MENTAL HEALTH, PAIN, DIABETES, AND CANCER ARE HEALTH ISSUES FOR WHICH A PERMANENT CURE IS NOT AVAILABLE IN A MAJORITY OF CASES IN MODERN MEDICINE, ALTHOUGH ALLEVIATING TREATMENTS ARE AVAILABLE. THIS HAS PROBABLY FUELED INTEREST IN COMPLEMENTARY APPROACHES SUCH AS YOGA FOR THESE HEALTH ISSUES. RESEARCH TIMELINE SHOWS THAT YOGA-RELATED RESEARCH LARGELY EXPANDED ONLY AFTER THE 2000S. THERE WAS A SPECIFIC UPTICK AFTER 2004. SIMILAR TRENDS ARE SEEN IF WE LOOK AT JUST CLINICAL TRIALS OR RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS (RCTS) OR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS. THE PERCENTAGE OF TRIALS (CLINICAL AND RCT) AMONG PUBLISHED LITERATURE IS AROUND 10-15 % THIS IS COMPARABLE TO OTHER FIELDS THAT GAINED TRACTION AROUND 2000S (E.G. NON-INVASIVE BRAIN STIMULATION). GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION SHOWS THAT 37% OF ALL YOGA RELATED RESEARCH OUTPUT ORIGINATES IN THE USA, 19% FROM INDIA, 13% FROM EUROPE AND 31% FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD. THEREFORE, THE INTEREST IS WIDESPREAD AND GLOBAL. AT LEAST THE UPTICK IN YOGA-RELATED RESEARCH IN THE US POST-2000S CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO A SUBSTANTIAL JUMP IN FUNDING BETWEEN 1998 AND 2005 FROM US NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH'S NATIONAL CENTER FOR COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH (NCCIH). WE CAN ONLY SURMISE THAT RESEARCH IN THIS FIELD REACHED A CRITICAL MASS IN LATE-1990S, WHICH INFUSED MORE MONEY INTO THIS FIELD, GENERATING MORE RESEARCH AND CREATING A POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOP THAT HAS SUSTAINED THE GROWTH SO FAR. WE PROPOSE THAT IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN OR EVEN ACCELERATE FUTURE RESEARCH IN THE AREA, RIGOR AND REPRODUCIBILITY MUST BE ENHANCED IN ADDITION TO PERFORMING MORE RCT AND CLINICAL TRIALS (INCREASING % OF TRIALS TO 20-25% FROM 10-15%). THE FRUITS OF RESEARCH IN THE FIELD HAS TO REACH THE COMMON MAN IN TERMS OF EVIDENCE-BASED SOLUTIONS TO HEALTH ISSUES. WITHOUT THIS, ACCELERATED FUNDING IN DEMOCRACIES SUCH AS INDIA AND THE USA WILL NOT BE REALIZABLE.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
10 2688  21 YOGA IN THE TREATMENT OF MOOD AND ANXIETY DISORDERS: A REVIEW. BACKGROUND: PATIENT USE OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS, INCLUDING YOGA, TO MANAGE MOOD AND ANXIETY DISORDERS, HAS BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED. DESPITE RESEARCH INTEREST, THERE ARE FEW RECENT REVIEWS OF THE EVIDENCE OF THE BENEFIT OF YOGA IN THESE CONDITIONS. METHOD: THE PUBMED, MEDLINE AND PSYCINFO DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR LITERATURE PUBLISHED UP TO JULY 2008, RELATING TO YOGA AND DEPRESSIVE AND ANXIETY DISORDERS. RESULTS: THE PAUCITY OF REPORTED STUDIES AND SEVERAL METHODOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS LIMIT DATA INTERPRETATION. IN DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS, YOGA MAY BE COMPARABLE TO MEDICATION AND THE COMBINATION SUPERIOR TO MEDICATION ALONE. THERE IS REASONABLE EVIDENCE FOR ITS USE AS SECOND-LINE MONOTHERAPY OR AUGMENTATION TO MEDICATION IN MILD TO MODERATE MAJOR DEPRESSION AND DYSTHYMIA, WITH EARLY EVIDENCE OF BENEFIT IN MORE SEVERE DEPRESSION. IN ANXIETY DISORDERS, YOGA MAY BE SUPERIOR TO MEDICATION FOR A SUBGROUP OF PATIENTS, BUT ITS BENEFITS IN SPECIFIC CONDITIONS ARE STILL LARGELY UNKNOWN. SECOND-LINE MONOTHERAPY IS INDICATED IN PERFORMANCE OR TEST ANXIETY, BUT ONLY PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE EXISTS FOR OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER AND POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. YOGA APPEARS TO BE SUPERIOR TO NO TREATMENT AND PROGRESSIVE RELAXATION FOR BOTH DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, AND MAY BENEFIT MOOD AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAL ILLNESS. IT SHOWS GOOD SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY IN SHORT-TERM TREATMENT. CONCLUSION: REASONABLE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE BENEFIT OF YOGA IN SPECIFIC DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS. THE EVIDENCE IS STILL PRELIMINARY IN ANXIETY DISORDERS. GIVEN ITS PATIENT APPEAL AND THE PROMISING FINDINGS THUS FAR, FURTHER RESEARCH ON YOGA IN THESE CONDITIONS IS ENCOURAGED.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
11 2126  32 THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR DEPRESSION: A CRITICAL LITERATURE REVIEW. IN THE UNITED STATES, THE PREVALENCE OF DEPRESSION IS QUITE HIGH-9% IN THE GENERAL POPULATION-WITH WOMEN, YOUNG ADULTS, AND SENIORS PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE. IN RECENT YEARS, INCREASING NUMBERS OF PEOPLE ARE TURNING TO COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE (CAM) FOR RELIEF FROM DEPRESSION AND OTHER MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS. ONE FORM OF CAM, YOGA, HAS BEEN GROWING IN POPULARITY; THIS RISE IN POPULARITY HAS, IN PART, BEEN DRIVEN BY INTEREST IN HOW THIS PRACTICE, WITH ITS MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION ASPECTS, MAY DECREASE DEPRESSION. THIS CRITICAL LITERATURE REVIEW EXAMINES SIX RECENT STUDIES ON YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION; SPECIFICALLY, THIS REVIEW FOCUSES ON YOGA STYLES IN WHICH THE PRACTICE OF YOGA POSES, CALLED ASANAS, IS THE CORE COMPONENT. ALTHOUGH THE SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE FINDINGS ARE PROMISING, THE STUDIES HAD METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS; IDENTIFICATION OF THESE LIMITATIONS CAN INFORM FUTURE STUDIES.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
12 1575  31 MANAGING MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS RESULTING FROM TRAUMA THROUGH YOGA: A REVIEW. THERE ARE MANY AND VARIED TYPES OF TRAUMA. THE EXTENT TO WHICH TRAUMA INFLUENCES THE MENTAL HEALTH OF AN INDIVIDUAL DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF TRAUMA, AS WELL AS ON THE INDIVIDUAL'S COPING CAPABILITIES. OFTEN TRAUMA IS FOLLOWED BY DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND PTSD. AS THE PHARMACOLOGICAL REMEDIES FOR THESE CONDITIONS OFTEN HAVE UNDESIRABLE SIDE-EFFECTS, NONPHARMACOLOGICAL REMEDIES ARE THOUGHT OF AS A POSSIBLE ADD-ON TREATMENT. YOGA IS ONE SUCH MIND-BODY INTERVENTION. THIS PAPER COVERS ELEVEN STUDIES INDEXED IN PUBMED, IN WHICH MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS RESULTING FROM TRAUMA WERE MANAGED THROUGH YOGA INCLUDING MEDITATION. THE AIM WAS TO EVALUATE THE USE OF YOGA IN MANAGING TRAUMA-RELATED DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, PTSD AND PHYSIOLOGICAL STRESS FOLLOWING EXPOSURE TO NATURAL CALAMITIES, WAR, INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE, AND INCARCERATION IN A CORRECTIONAL FACILITY. AN ATTEMPT HAS ALSO BEEN MADE TO EXPLORE POSSIBLE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING BENEFITS SEEN. AS MOST OF THESE STUDIES WERE NOT DONE ON PERSONS EXPOSED TO TRAUMA THAT HAD PRACTICED YOGA, THIS IS A DEFINITE AREA FOR FURTHER RESEARCH.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
13 1289  34 GREATER WIDESPREAD FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY OF THE CAUDATE IN OLDER ADULTS WHO PRACTICE KRIPALU YOGA AND VIPASSANA MEDITATION THAN IN CONTROLS. THERE HAS BEEN A GROWING INTEREST IN UNDERSTANDING HOW CONTEMPLATIVE PRACTICES AFFECT BRAIN FUNCTIONAL ORGANIZATION. HOWEVER, MOST STUDIES HAVE RESTRICTED THEIR EXPLORATION TO PREDEFINED NETWORKS. FURTHERMORE, SCIENTIFIC COMPARISONS OF DIFFERENT CONTEMPLATIVE TRADITIONS ARE LARGELY LACKING. HERE WE EXPLORED DIFFERENCES IN WHOLE BRAIN RESTING STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN EXPERIENCED YOGA PRACTITIONERS, EXPERIENCED MEDITATORS, AND MATCHED CONTROLS. ANALYSES WERE REPEATED IN AN INDEPENDENT SAMPLE OF EXPERIENCED MEDITATORS AND MATCHED CONTROLS. ANALYSES UTILIZING NETWORK-BASED STATISTICS (ZALESKY ET AL., 2010) REVEALED DIFFERENCE COMPONENTS FOR YOGA PRACTITIONERS > CONTROLS AND MEDITATORS > CONTROLS IN WHICH THE RIGHT CAUDATE WAS A CENTRAL NODE. FOLLOW UP ANALYSES REVEALED THAT YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND MEDITATORS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER DEGREE CENTRALITY IN THE CAUDATE THAN CONTROLS. THIS GREATER DEGREE CENTRALITY WAS NOT DRIVEN BY SINGLE CONNECTIONS BUT BY GREATER CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN THE CAUDATE AND NUMEROUS BRAIN REGIONS. FINDINGS OF GREATER CAUDATE CONNECTIVITY IN MEDITATORS THAN IN CONTROLS WAS REPLICATED IN AN INDEPENDENT DATASET. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA AND MEDITATION PRACTITIONERS HAVE STRONGER FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY WITHIN BASAL GANGLIA CORTICO-THALAMIC FEEDBACK LOOPS THAN NON-PRACTITIONERS. ALTHOUGH WE COULD NOT PROVIDE EVIDENCE FOR ITS MECHANISTIC ROLE, THIS GREATER CONNECTIVITY MIGHT BE RELATED TO THE OFTEN REPORTED EFFECTS OF MEDITATION AND YOGA ON BEHAVIORAL FLEXIBILITY, MENTAL HEALTH, AND WELL-BEING.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
14  588  31 DETERMINING PSYCHONEUROIMMUNOLOGIC MARKERS OF YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR PERSONS DIAGNOSED WITH PTSD: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. THERE IS A GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH ON YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS OF POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) ACCOMPANIED BY SPECULATIONS ON UNDERLYING PHYSIOLOGIC MECHANISMS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW IS TO IDENTIFY, QUALITATIVELY EVALUATE, AND SYNTHESIZE STUDIES OF YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR PTSD THAT MEASURED PHYSIOLOGIC OUTCOMES IN ORDER TO GAIN INSIGHTS INTO POTENTIAL MECHANISMS. THE FOCUS IS ON STUDIES EVALUATING YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION FOR PTSD RATHER THAN FOR TRAUMA EXPOSURE, PTSD PREVENTION, OR SUBCLINICAL PTSD. MULTIPLE DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR PUBLICATIONS FROM THE PAST TWO DECADES USING TERMS DERIVED FROM THE QUESTION, "IN PEOPLE WITH PTSD, WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON OBJECTIVE OUTCOMES?" ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA INCLUDED YOGA-ONLY MODALITIES TESTED AS AN INTERVENTION FOR FORMALLY DIAGNOSED PTSD WITH AT LEAST ONE PHYSIOLOGIC OUTCOME. RESULTS OF THIS REVIEW CONFIRMED THAT, THOUGH MUCH OF THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE PROPOSES PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS UNDERLYING YOGA'S EFFECTS ON PTSD, VERY FEW STUDIES ( N = 3) HAVE ACTUALLY EVALUATED PHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE. ADDITIONALLY, SEVERAL STUDIES HAD METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS. IN LIGHT OF THE LIMITED DATA SUPPORTING YOGA'S BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM DYSREGULATION, WE PRESENT A THEORETICAL MODEL OF THE PSYCHONEUROIMMUNOLOGIC PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH PTSD AND THE EFFECTS YOGA MAY HAVE ON THESE PROCESSES TO GUIDE FUTURE RESEARCH. GAPS IN THE LITERATURE REMAIN FOR MECHANISMS RELATED TO ACTIVATION OF THE HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-ADRENAL AXIS AND INFLAMMATION. ADDITIONAL RIGOROUS MECHANISTIC STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO GUIDE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR PTSD TO AUGMENT EXISTING EVIDENCE-BASED PTSD TREATMENTS.	2018

16 2014  33 SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA: BREATHING FOR HEALTH. BREATHING TECHNIQUES ARE REGULARLY RECOMMENDED FOR RELAXATION, STRESS MANAGEMENT, CONTROL OF PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL STATES, AND TO IMPROVE ORGAN FUNCTION. YOGIC BREATHING, DEFINED AS A MANIPULATION OF BREATH MOVEMENT, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO POSITIVELY AFFECT IMMUNE FUNCTION, AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IMBALANCES, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL OR STRESS-RELATED DISORDERS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS AND PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS, THE MIND-BODY CONNECTION, AND THE BENEFITS OF SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA (SKY) IN A WIDE RANGE OF CLINICAL CONDITIONS. VARIOUS ONLINE DATABASES SEARCHED WERE MEDLINE, PSYCHINFO, EMBASE, AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR. ALL THE RESULTS WERE CAREFULLY SCREENED AND ARTICLES ON SKY WERE SELECTED. THE REFERENCES FROM THESE ARTICLES WERE CHECKED TO FIND ANY OTHER POTENTIALLY RELEVANT ARTICLES. SKY, A UNIQUE YOGIC BREATHING PRACTICE, INVOLVES SEVERAL TYPES OF CYCLICAL BREATHING PATTERNS, RANGING FROM SLOW AND CALMING TO RAPID AND STIMULATING. THERE IS MOUNTING EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT SKY CAN BE A BENEFICIAL, LOW-RISK, LOW-COST ADJUNCT TO THE TREATMENT OF STRESS, ANXIETY, POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER, DEPRESSION, STRESS-RELATED MEDICAL ILLNESSES, SUBSTANCE ABUSE, AND REHABILITATION OF CRIMINAL OFFENDERS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
17 2632  27 YOGA FOR TRAUMA AND RELATED MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS: A META-REVIEW WITH CLINICAL AND SERVICE RECOMMENDATIONS. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE EXPRESSED GROWING INTEREST IN THE BENEFITS OF YOGA TO HELP INDIVIDUALS COPE WITH THE EFFECTS OF TRAUMA, INCLUDING ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD). DESPITE THE GROWING POPULARITY AND STRONG APPEAL OF YOGA, PROVIDERS MUST BE MINDFUL OF THE EVIDENCE REGARDING THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN TREATING TRAUMA EFFECTS AS WELL AS TRAUMA-RELATED MENTAL HEALTH SYMPTOMS AND ILLNESSES. THEREFORE, OUR RESEARCH TEAM SOUGHT TO ANSWER TWO QUESTIONS: (A) WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE REGARDING YOGA AS A TREATMENT FOR TRAUMA EFFECTS, INCLUDING ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND PTSD AND (B) WHAT ARE THE CLINICAL AND SERVICE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR USING YOGA WITH TRAUMA-EXPOSED INDIVIDUALS? OUR INITIAL SCANS IDENTIFIED A SUBSTANTIAL BODY OF RESEARCH, INCLUDING REVIEWS. RATHER THAN REPLICATE EARLIER EFFORTS, WE UNDERTOOK A SYSTEMATIC META-REVIEW OF 13 LITERATURE REVIEWS, ONE OF WHICH INCLUDED A META-ANALYSIS. WE DETERMINED THE 13 REVIEWS EXAMINED 185 DISTINCT STUDIES. FINDINGS SHOW THAT THE EVIDENCE REGARDING YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR THE EFFECTS OF TRAUMA AS WELL AS THE MENTAL HEALTH SYMPTOMS AND ILLNESSES OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH TRAUMA IS ENCOURAGING BUT PRELIMINARY. OVERALL, THE BODY OF RESEARCH IS LACKING IN RIGOR AS WELL AS SPECIFICITY REGARDING TRAUMA. REVIEW RESULTS ALSO ONLY ALLOW FOR THE RECOMMENDATION OF YOGA AS AN ANCILLARY TREATMENT. FURTHER, THE REVIEWS HAD CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCES IN THEIR METHODS AND LIMITATIONS. NONETHELESS, THE RESULTS YIELDED FINDINGS CONCERNING HOW CLINICIANS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS CAN USE YOGA IN THEIR OWN PRACTICES, WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FOR BUILDING AN EVIDENCE BASE IN THIS AREA.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
18  576  25 DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY DISORDERS: BENEFITS OF EXERCISE, YOGA, AND MEDITATION. MANY PEOPLE WITH DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY TURN TO NONPHARMACOLOGIC AND NONCONVENTIONAL INTERVENTIONS, INCLUDING EXERCISE, YOGA, MEDITATION, TAI CHI, OR QI GONG. META-ANALYSES AND SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS HAVE SHOWN THAT THESE INTERVENTIONS CAN IMPROVE SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY DISORDERS. AS AN ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT, EXERCISE SEEMS MOST HELPFUL FOR TREATMENT-RESISTANT DEPRESSION, UNIPOLAR DEPRESSION, AND POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. YOGA AS MONOTHERAPY OR ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY SHOWS POSITIVE EFFECTS, PARTICULARLY FOR DEPRESSION. AS AN ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY, IT FACILITATES TREATMENT OF ANXIETY DISORDERS, PARTICULARLY PANIC DISORDER. TAI CHI AND QI GONG MAY BE HELPFUL AS ADJUNCTIVE THERAPIES FOR DEPRESSION, BUT EFFECTS ARE INCONSISTENT. AS MONOTHERAPY OR AN ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY, MINDFULNESS-BASED MEDITATION HAS POSITIVE EFFECTS ON DEPRESSION, AND ITS EFFECTS CAN LAST FOR SIX MONTHS OR MORE. ALTHOUGH POSITIVE FINDINGS ARE LESS COMMON IN PEOPLE WITH ANXIETY DISORDERS, THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS ADJUNCTIVE USE. THERE ARE NO APPARENT NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS, AND THEIR GENERAL HEALTH BENEFITS JUSTIFY THEIR USE AS ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY DISORDERS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
19 2466  22 YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION: A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF PUBLISHED RESEARCH STUDIES. ALTHOUGH YOGA IS HISTORICALLY A SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE, IT HAS ALSO BEEN USED CLINICALLY AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION. A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS ON THE BIOMEDICAL JOURNAL LITERATURE INVOLVING RESEARCH ON THE CLINICAL APPLICATION OF YOGA HAS REVEALED AN INCREASE IN PUBLICATION FREQUENCY OVER THE PAST 3 DECADES WITH A SUBSTANTIAL AND GROWING USE OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. TYPES OF MEDICAL CONDITIONS HAVE INCLUDED PSYCHOPATHOLOGICAL (E.G. DEPRESSION, ANXIETY), CARDIOVASCULAR (E.G. HYPERTENSION, HEART DISEASE), RESPIRATORY (E.G. ASTHMA), DIABETES AND A VARIETY OF OTHERS. A MAJORITY OF THIS RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONDUCTED BY INDIAN INVESTIGATORS AND PUBLISHED IN INDIAN JOURNALS, PARTICULARLY YOGA SPECIALTY JOURNALS, ALTHOUGH RECENT TRENDS INDICATE INCREASING CONTRIBUTIONS FROM INVESTIGATORS IN THE U.S. AND ENGLAND. YOGA THERAPY IS A RELATIVELY NOVEL AND EMERGING CLINICAL DISCIPLINE WITHIN THE BROAD CATEGORY OF MIND-BODY MEDICINE, WHOSE GROWTH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE BURGEONING POPULARITY OF YOGA IN THE WEST AND THE INCREASING WORLDWIDE USE OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE.	2004	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
20 1640  41 MOLECULAR SIGNATURE OF THE IMMUNE RESPONSE TO YOGA THERAPY IN STRESS-RELATED CHRONIC DISEASE CONDITIONS: AN INSIGHT. THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION DEFINES HEALTH AS COMPLETE WELL-BEING IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL, MENTAL AND SOCIAL, AND NOT MERELY THE ABSENCE OF DISEASE. TO ATTAIN THIS, INDIVIDUAL SHOULD ADAPT AND SELF-MANGE THE SOCIAL, PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL CHALLENGES OF LIFE. EXPOSURE TO CHRONIC STRESS DUE TO URBANIZATION, WORK STRESS, NUCLEAR FAMILY, POLLUTION, UNHEALTHY FOOD HABITS, LIFESTYLE, ACCIDENTAL DEATH IN THE FAMILY, AND NATURAL CALAMITIES ARE THE TRIGGERING FACTORS, LEADING TO HORMONAL IMBALANCE AND INFLAMMATION IN THE TISSUE. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STRESS AND ILLNESS IS COMPLEX; ALL CHRONIC ILLNESSES SUCH AS CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND ASTHMA HAVE THEIR ROOT IN CHRONIC STRESS ATTRIBUTED BY INFLAMMATION. IN RECENT TIMES, YOGA THERAPY HAS EMERGED AS AN IMPORTANT COMPLEMENTARY ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE FOR MANY HUMAN DISEASES. YOGA THERAPY HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON MIND AND BODY; IT ACTS BY INCORPORATING APPROPRIATE BREATHING TECHNIQUES AND MINDFULNESS TO ATTAIN CONSCIOUS DIRECTION OF OUR AWARENESS OF THE PRESENT MOMENT BY MEDITATION, WHICH HELPS ACHIEVE HARMONY BETWEEN THE BODY AND MIND. STUDIES HAVE ALSO DEMONSTRATED THE IMPORTANT REGULATORY EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY ON BRAIN STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONS. DESPITE THESE ADVANCES, THE CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR MECHANISMS BY WHICH YOGA THERAPY RENDERS ITS BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ARE INADEQUATELY KNOWN. A GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT YOGA THERAPY HAS IMMUNOMODULATORY EFFECTS. HOWEVER, THE PRECISE MECHANISTIC BASIS HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED EMPIRICALLY. IN THIS REVIEW, WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO HIGHLIGHT THE EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY ON IMMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTIONING WITH AN AIM TO IDENTIFY IMPORTANT IMMUNOLOGICAL SIGNATURES THAT INDEX THE EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY.

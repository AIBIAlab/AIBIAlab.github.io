1  524 160 COMPARISON OF COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY AND YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF LATE-LIFE WORRY: A RANDOMIZED PREFERENCE TRIAL. BACKGROUND: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT) AND YOGA ON LATE-LIFE WORRY, ANXIETY, AND SLEEP; AND EXAMINE PREFERENCE AND SELECTION EFFECTS ON THESE OUTCOMES. METHODS: A RANDOMIZED PREFERENCE TRIAL OF CBT AND YOGA WAS CONDUCTED IN COMMUNITY-DWELLING ADULTS 60 YEARS OR OLDER, WHO SCORED 26 OR ABOVE ON THE PENN STATE WORRY QUESTIONNAIRE-ABBREVIATED (PSWQ-A). CBT CONSISTED OF 10 WEEKLY TELEPHONE SESSIONS. YOGA CONSISTED OF 20 BIWEEKLY GROUP YOGA CLASSES. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS WORRY (PSWQ-A); THE SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE ANXIETY (PROMIS-ANXIETY) AND SLEEP (INSOMNIA SEVERITY INDEX [ISI]). WE EXAMINED BOTH PREFERENCE EFFECTS (AVERAGE EFFECT FOR THOSE WHO RECEIVED THEIR PREFERRED INTERVENTION [REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT WAS CBT OR YOGA] MINUS THE AVERAGE FOR THOSE WHO DID NOT RECEIVE THEIR PREFERRED INTERVENTION [REGARDLESS OF THE INTERVENTION]) AND SELECTION EFFECT (WHICH ADDRESSES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THERE IS A BENEFIT TO GETTING TO SELECT ONE INTERVENTION OVER THE OTHER, AND MEASURES THE EFFECT ON OUTCOMES OF SELF-SELECTION TO A SPECIFIC INTERVENTION). RESULTS: FIVE HUNDRED OLDER ADULTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO THE RANDOMIZED TRIAL (125 EACH IN CBT AND YOGA) OR THE PREFERENCE TRIAL (120 CHOSE CBT; 130 CHOSE YOGA). IN THE RANDOMIZED TRIAL, THE INTERVENTION EFFECT OF YOGA COMPARED WITH CBT ADJUSTED FOR BASELINE PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION USE, GENDER, AND RACE WAS 1.6 (-0.2, 3.3), P = .08 FOR THE PSWQ-A. SIMILAR RESULTS WERE OBSERVED WITH PROMIS-ANXIETY (ADJUSTED INTERVENTION EFFECT: 0.3 [-1.5, 2.2], P = .71). PARTICIPANTS RANDOMIZED TO CBT EXPERIENCED A GREATER REDUCTION IN THE ISI COMPARED WITH YOGA (ADJUSTED INTERVENTION EFFECT: 2.4 [1.2, 3.7], P < .01]). ESTIMATED IN THE COMBINED DATA SET (N = 500), THE PREFERENCE AND SELECTION EFFECTS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR THE PSWQ-A, PROMIS-ANXIETY, AND ISI. OF THE 52 ADVERSE EVENTS, ONLY TWO WERE POSSIBLY RELATED TO THE INTERVENTION. NONE OF THE 26 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS WERE RELATED TO THE STUDY INTERVENTIONS. CONCLUSIONS: CBT AND YOGA WERE BOTH EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING LATE-LIFE WORRY AND ANXIETY. HOWEVER, A GREATER IMPACT WAS SEEN FOR CBT COMPARED WITH YOGA FOR IMPROVING SLEEP. NEITHER PREFERENCE NOR SELECTION EFFECTS WAS FOUND.	2020	
                                       
2 2562  44 YOGA FOR CHRONIC NECK PAIN: A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL. UNLABELLED: YOGA HAS BEEN FOUND EFFECTIVE IN THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. WE AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF IYENGAR YOGA IN CHRONIC NECK PAIN BY MEANS OF A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. SEVENTY-SEVEN PATIENTS (AGED 47.9 +/- 7.9, 67 FEMALE) WITH CHRONIC NECK PAIN WHO SCORED >40 MM ON A 100-MM VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS) WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 9-WEEK IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM WITH WEEKLY 90-MINUTE CLASSES (N = 38) OR TO A SELF-CARE/EXERCISE PROGRAM (N = 38). PATIENTS WERE EXAMINED AT BASELINE AND AFTER 4 AND 10 WEEKS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS CHANGE OF MEAN PAIN AT REST (VAS) FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 10. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED PAIN AT MOTION, FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), AND PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES. TWELVE PATIENTS IN THE YOGA GROUP AND 11 PATIENTS IN THE SELF-CARE/EXERCISE GROUP WERE LOST TO FOLLOW-UP, WITH HIGHER STUDY NONADHERENCE IN THE SELF-CARE GROUP (5 VERSUS 10 PATIENTS). MEAN PAIN AT REST WAS REDUCED FROM 44.3 +/- 20.1 TO 13.0 +/- 11.6 AT WEEK 10 BY YOGA AND FROM 41.9 +/- 21.9 TO 34.4 +/- 21.1 BY SELF-CARE/EXERCISE (GROUP DIFFERENCE: -20.1, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL: -30.0, -10.1; P < .001). PAIN AT MOTION WAS REDUCED FROM 53.4 +/- 18.5 TO 22.4 +/- 18.7 AT WEEK 10 BY YOGA AND FROM 49.4 +/- 22.8 TO 39.9 +/- 21.5 BY SELF-CARE/EXERCISE (GROUP DIFFERENCE: -18.7, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL: -29.3, -8.1; P < .001). SIGNIFICANT TREATMENT EFFECTS OF YOGA WERE ALSO FOUND FOR PAIN-RELATED APPREHENSION, DISABILITY, QOL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES. SENSITIVITY ANALYSES SUGGESTED MINIMAL INFLUENCE OF DROPOUT RATES. BOTH PROGRAMS WERE WELL TOLERATED. IN THIS PRELIMINARY TRIAL, YOGA APPEARS TO BE AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT IN CHRONIC NECK PAIN WITH POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL EFFECTS ON PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING AND QOL. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN CHRONIC NECK PAIN SHOULD BE FURTHER TESTED BY COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS STUDIES WITH LONGER OBSERVATION PERIODS. PERSPECTIVE: THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTS OF A 9-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM OR SELF-CARE EXERCISE IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC NECK PAIN. YOGA LED TO SUPERIOR PAIN RELIEF AND FUNCTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS AND MIGHT BE A USEFUL TREATMENT OPTION FOR CHRONIC NECK PAIN.	2012	
                                                                                                                                    
3  187  79 A RANDOMIZED PREFERENCE TRIAL COMPARING COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY AND YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF LATE-LIFE WORRY: EXAMINATION OF IMPACT ON DEPRESSION, GENERALIZED ANXIETY, FATIGUE, PAIN, SOCIAL PARTICIPATION, AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION. BACKGROUND: DEPRESSION, GENERALIZED ANXIETY, FATIGUE, DIMINISHED PHYSICAL FUNCTION, REDUCED SOCIAL PARTICIPATION, AND PAIN ARE COMMON FOR MANY OLDER ADULTS AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT QUALITY OF LIFE. THE PURPOSE OF THE OVERALL TRIAL WAS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT) AND YOGA ON LATE-LIFE WORRY, ANXIETY, AND SLEEP; AND EXAMINE PREFERENCE AND SELECTION EFFECTS ON THESE OUTCOMES. OBJECTIVE: THE PRESENT ANALYSES COMPARED EFFECTS OF THE 2 INTERVENTIONS ON ADDITIONAL OUTCOMES (DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, GENERALIZED ANXIETY SYMPTOMS, FATIGUE, PAIN INTERFERENCE/INTENSITY, PHYSICAL FUNCTION, SOCIAL PARTICIPATION); AND EXAMINED WHETHER THERE ARE PREFERENCE AND SELECTION EFFECTS FOR THESE TREATMENTS. METHODS: A RANDOMIZED PREFERENCE TRIAL OF CBT AND YOGA WAS CONDUCTED IN ADULTS >/=60 YEARS WHO SCORED >/=26 ON THE PENN STATE WORRY QUESTIONNAIRE-ABBREVIATED (PSWQ-A), RECRUITED FROM OUTPATIENT MEDICAL CLINICS, MAILINGS, AND ADVERTISEMENTS. COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY CONSISTED OF 10 WEEKLY TELEPHONE SESSIONS. YOGA CONSISTED OF 20 BI-WEEKLY GROUP YOGA CLASSES. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO(1): A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) OF CBT OR YOGA (N = 250); OR (2) A PREFERENCE TRIAL IN WHICH THEY SELECTED THEIR TREATMENT (CBT OR YOGA; N = 250). OUTCOMES WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION. RESULTS: WITHIN THE RCT, THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCES FOR BOTH PAIN INTERFERENCE AND INTENSITY. THE PAIN INTERFERENCE SCORE IMPROVED MORE FOR THE CBT GROUP COMPARED WITH THE YOGA GROUP [INTERVENTION EFFECT OF (MEAN (95% CI) = 2.5 (.5, 4.6), P = .02]. FOR THE PAIN INTENSITY SCORE, THE INTERVENTION EFFECT ALSO FAVORED CBT OVER YOGA [.7 (.2, 1.3), P < .01]. DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, GENERALIZED ANXIETY, AND FATIGUE SHOWED CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL WITHIN-GROUP CHANGES IN BOTH GROUPS. THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN OR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PHYSICAL FUNCTION OR SOCIAL PARTICIPATION FOR EITHER GROUP. NO PREFERENCE OR SELECTION EFFECTS WERE FOUND. CONCLUSION: BOTH CBT AND YOGA MAY BE USEFUL FOR OLDER ADULTS FOR IMPROVING PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS AND FATIGUE. COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY MAY OFFER EVEN GREATER BENEFIT THAN YOGA FOR DECREASING PAIN.	2022	

4 1419  40 IMPRISONING YOGA: YOGA PRACTICE MAY INCREASE THE CHARACTER MATURITY OF MALE PRISON INMATES. BACKGROUND: A SPECIFIC PERSONALITY PROFILE, CHARACTERIZED BY LOW CHARACTER MATURITY (LOW SCORES ON THE SELF-DIRECTEDNESS AND COOPERATIVENESS CHARACTER DIMENSIONS) AND HIGH SCORES ON THE NOVELTY SEEKING TEMPERAMENT DIMENSION OF THE TEMPERAMENT AND CHARACTER INVENTORY (TCI), HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH AGGRESSIVE ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOR IN MALE PRISON INMATES. IT HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN THAT YOGA PRACTICED IN SWEDISH CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES HAS POSITIVE EFFECTS ON THE INMATES' WELL-BEING AND ON RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH CRIMINAL RECIDIVISM (E.G., ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOR). IN THIS STUDY, WE AIMED TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICE ON INMATES' BEHAVIORS COULD BE EXTENDED TO INCLUDE EVENTUAL CHANGES IN THEIR PERSONALITY PROFILE. METHODS: MALE PRISON INMATES (N = 111) IN SWEDEN PARTICIPATED IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED 10-WEEK LONG YOGA INTERVENTION TRIAL. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER A YOGA GROUP (ONE CLASS A WEEK; N = 57) OR A CONTROL GROUP (FREE OF CHOICE WEEKLY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY; N = 54). ALL THE INMATES COMPLETED THE TCI QUESTIONNAIRE BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION PERIOD AS PART OF AN ASSESSMENT BATTERY. RESULTS: AFTER THE 10-WEEK-LONG INTERVENTION PERIOD MALE INMATES SCORED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER ON THE NOVELTY SEEKING AND THE HARM AVOIDANCE AND SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ON THE SELF-DIRECTEDNESS DIMENSIONS OF THE TCI. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT MEDIUM STRONG INTERACTION EFFECT BETWEEN TIME AND GROUP BELONGING FOR THE SELF-DIRECTEDNESS DIMENSION OF CHARACTER FAVORING THE YOGA GROUP. CONCLUSION: A 10-WEEK-LONG YOGA PRACTICE INTERVENTION AMONG MALE INMATES IN SWEDISH CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES INCREASED THE INMATES' CHARACTER MATURITY, IMPROVING SUCH ABILITIES AS THEIR CAPABILITY TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY, FEEL MORE PURPOSEFUL, AND BEING MORE SELF-ACCEPTANT-FEATURES THAT PREVIOUSLY WERE FOUND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED AGGRESSIVE ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOR.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
5 1622  29 MINDFULNESS AND LEVELS OF STRESS: A COMPARISON OF BEGINNER AND ADVANCED HATHA YOGA PRACTITIONERS. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO EXAMINE MINDFULNESS AND STRESS LEVELS IN BEGINNER AND ADVANCED PRACTITIONERS OF HATHA YOGA. PARTICIPANTS (N = 52) WERE RECRUITED THROUGH HATHA YOGA SCHOOLS LOCAL TO WESTERN MASSACHUSETTS. BEGINNER PRACTITIONERS (N = 24) WERE DESIGNATED AS THOSE WITH UNDER 5 YEARS (M = 3.33) EXPERIENCE AND ADVANCED PRACTITIONERS (N = 28) AS THOSE WITH OVER 5 YEARS (M = 14.53) EXPERIENCE IN HATHA YOGA. THE PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE MINDFUL ATTENTION AWARENESS SCALE (MAAS; BROWN AND RYAN 2003) AND THE PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE (PSS; COHEN ET AL. 1983) DIRECTLY PRECEDING A REGULARLY SCHEDULED HATHA YOGA CLASS. BASED ON TWO INDEPENDENT-SAMPLES T-TESTS, ADVANCED PARTICIPANTS SCORED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN MINDFULNESS LEVELS (P < .05) AND SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN STRESS LEVELS (P < .05) WHEN COMPARED TO BEGINNER PARTICIPANTS. ADDITIONALLY, A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE CORRELATION (R = -.45, P = .00) WAS FOUND BETWEEN MINDFULNESS AND STRESS LEVELS. NO SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS WERE FOUND BETWEEN EXPERIENCE LEVELS AND MINDFULNESS AND STRESS LEVELS. HATHA YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE TECHNIQUE FOR ENHANCING MINDFULNESS AND DECREASING STRESS LEVELS IN PRACTITIONERS.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
6  125  35 A PILOT STUDY OF YOGA TREATMENT IN CHILDREN WITH FUNCTIONAL ABDOMINAL PAIN AND IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME. OBJECTIVES: THE AIM OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA EXERCISES ON PAIN FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY AND ON QUALITY OF LIFE IN CHILDREN WITH FUNCTIONAL ABDOMINAL PAIN. DESIGN: 20 CHILDREN, AGED 8-18 YEARS, WITH IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME (IBS) OR FUNCTIONAL ABDOMINAL PAIN (FAP) WERE ENROLLED AND RECEIVED 10 YOGA LESSONS. PAIN INTENSITY AND PAIN FREQUENCY WERE SCORED IN A PAIN DIARY AND QUALITY OF LIFE WAS MEASURED WITH THE KIDSCREEN QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE (KQOL). RESULTS: IN THE 8-11 YEAR OLD GROUP AND THE 11-18 YEAR OLD GROUP PAIN FREQUENCY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED AT THE END OF THERAPY (P=0.031 AND P=0.004) COMPARED TO BASELINE. IN THE 8-11 YEAR GROUP PAIN INTENSITY WAS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED AT THIS TIME POINT (P=0.015). AFTER 3 MONTHS THERE STILL WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN PAIN FREQUENCY IN THE YOUNGER PATIENT GROUP (P=0.04) AND A BORDERLINE SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN PAIN FREQUENCY IN THE TOTAL GROUP (P=0.052). PARENTS REPORTED A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER KQOL-SCORE AFTER YOGA TREATMENT. CONCLUSION: THIS PILOT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT YOGA EXERCISES ARE EFFECTIVE FOR CHILDREN AGED 8-18 YEARS WITH FAP, RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF PAIN INTENSITY AND FREQUENCY, ESPECIALLY IN CHILDREN OF 8-11 YEARS OLD.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
7 1681  32 ONLINE ISHA UPA YOGA FOR STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING DURING COVID-19: A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL. COLLEGE STUDENTS EXPERIENCED INCREASED STRESS AND ANXIETY DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THIS STUDY EVALUATED THE EFFECT OF BRIEF ONLINE ISHA UPA YOGA MODULES ON UNDERGRADUATES' MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL (RCT) WITH WAITLIST CONTROL CROSSOVER (N = 679). THE INTERVENTION GROUP WAS INSTRUCTED TO LEARN AND PRACTICE THE MODULES DAILY FOR 12 WEEKS. AT THE END OF THE 4-WEEK RCT, THE CONTROL GROUP WAS INSTRUCTED TO LEARN AND PRACTICE THE MODULES FOR THE REMAINING 8 WEEKS. PRIMARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED STRESS AND WELL-BEING. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, RESILIENCE, POSITIVE AFFECT AND NEGATIVE AFFECT. LINEAR MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS WERE USED FOR ANALYSES. ISHA UPA YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED STRESS (GROUP [INTERVENTION, CONTROL] X TIME [BASELINE, WEEK 4] INTERACTION, P = .009, D = .27) AND INCREASED WELL-BEING (GROUP X TIME INTERACTION P = .002, D = .32). BY THE STUDY'S END, THE INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN WELL-BEING (P < .001, P < .001), STRESS (P < .001, P < .001), ANXIETY (P < .001, P < .001), DEPRESSION (P < .001, P = .004), POSITIVE AFFECT (P = .04, P < .001), AND NEGATIVE AFFECT (P < .001, P < .001). ONLINE ISHA UPA YOGA SHOWS PROMISE FOR MITIGATING THE PANDEMIC'S NEGATIVE IMPACT ON UNDERGRADUATES' MENTAL HEALTH AND IMPROVING THEIR WELL-BEING.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
8  936  35 EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA VERSUS EXERCISE FOR REDUCING FALLING RISK IN OLDER ADULTS: PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL INDICES. OUR PURPOSE IN THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA TO ADDRESS MULTIPLE RISK FACTORS OF FALLING IN ACTIVE AND LOW ACTIVE OLDER ADULTS. COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS (N = 35) OVER THE AGE OF 65 ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED IN EITHER A YOGA PROGRAM, AN EXERCISE PROGRAM, OR A NO-PROGRAM CONTROL. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED MEASURES ASSOCIATED WITH FALLING RISKS. PHYSICAL MEASURES INCLUDED LOWER BODY STRENGTH, STATIC BALANCE, AND LOWER BODY FLEXIBILITY. PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASURES INCLUDED PERCEIVED SELF-EFFICACY WITH RESPECT TO FALLS AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE. WE DETERMINED BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCES USING PLANNED COMPARISONS, EFFECT SIZE, CONFIDENCE INTERVALS, AND PROBABILITY OF SUPERIORITY. RESULTS OF PLANNED COMPARISONS AND PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE TESTING INDICATED THAT YOGA PARTICIPANTS SCORED HIGHER THAN THE EXERCISE AND CONTROL PARTICIPANTS ON BOTH RIGHT AND LEFT LOWER BODY FLEXIBILITY TESTS. YOGA PARTICIPANTS ALSO SCORED HIGHER THAN THE CONTROL PARTICIPANTS ON RIGHT LEG STATIC BALANCE, AND THE RIGHT AND LEFT LOWER BODY FLEXIBILITY TESTS. THE EXERCISE PARTICIPANTS SCORED HIGHER THAN YOGA PARTICIPANTS ON THE RAND-36 QUALITY OF LIFE SUBSCALES OF ENERGY/FATIGUE, PAIN, AND GENERAL HEALTH. THE PROBABILITY OF SUPERIORITY RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE NO-PROGRAM OLDER ADULT PARTICIPANTS WOULD BENEFIT BY ENROLLING IN THE YOGA RATHER THAN THE EXERCISE PROGRAM TO REDUCE PHYSICAL RISKS OF FALLING. THESE FINDINGS WERE DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO PROMOTING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PROGRAMS TO REDUCE RISKS OF FALLING, AND THE ROLES OF THE PROTOCOL, PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE, AND MEASURES EMPLOYED WHEN DETERMINING PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
9 2148  31 THE EFFECTS OF PILATES AND YOGA PARTICIPANT'S ON ENGAGEMENT IN FUNCTIONAL MOVEMENT AND INDIVIDUAL HEALTH LEVEL. THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF PILATES AND YOGA PARTICIPATING IN THEIR FUNCTIONAL MOVEMENT AND INDIVIDUAL HEALTH LEVEL. NINETY VOLUNTEERS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO THREE GROUPS AND EVENLY RECRUITED FEMALE AND MALE PARTICIPANTS IN EACH GROUP THROUGH A RELIABLE ORGANIZATION. THEIR AGE GROUP WAS BETWEEN THE 30S AND 40S. THEY WERE INFORMED THE RESEARCH PROCESS AND ASSIGNED TO THE CONSENT FORM. PILATES GROUP (N=30), YOGA GROUP (N=30), AND CONTROL GROUP (N=30) WERE ASSIGNED TO FULFILL SHORT FORM OF RAND 36-ITEM HEALTH SURVEY (SF-36) SURVEY FORM BASED ON SELF-ADMINISTRATION METHOD AND WERE SCORED FUNCTIONAL MOVEMENT SCREEN (FMS) TEST BEFORE THE INTERVENTION. PILATES AND YOGA GROUP WERE CARRIED OUT CERTAIN EXERCISE PROGRAM 1-HR DURATION 3 TIMES PER WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS. AND CONTROL GROUP DID NOT PERFORM ANY EXERCISE DURING EXPERIMENTAL PERIOD. AFTER COMPLETION OF THE 8-WEEK PILATES AND YOGA PROGRAM, THEY RECORDED SF-36 AND WERE SCORED FMS SCORE FOR POSTTEST IN SAME WAY. WHEN WE COMPARED THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRE- AND POSTTREATMENT SCORES, WE FOUND THAT THERE WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE AMONG THREE GROUPS ON FMS (F [2,89]=15.56, P<0.001) AND THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN FAVOR OF PILATES GROUP GROUPS (F [2,89]=52.36, P<0.001) ON SF-36. TO CONCLUDE, PILATES GROUP WAS MORE EFFECTIVE FOR IMPROVING FUNCTIONAL MOVEMENT AND INDIVIDUAL HEALTH LEVEL TO ASSESS QUALITY OF LIFE THAN YOGA GROUP AND CONTROL GROUP.	2019

11 1557  63 LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY AND YOGA FOR WORRIED OLDER ADULTS. OBJECTIVES: COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT) AND YOGA DECREASE WORRY AND ANXIETY. THERE ARE NO LONG-TERM DATA COMPARING CBT AND YOGA FOR WORRY, ANXIETY, AND SLEEP IN OLDER ADULTS. THE IMPACT OF PREFERENCE AND SELECTION ON THESE OUTCOMES IS UNKNOWN. IN THIS SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS, WE COMPARED LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF CBT BY TELEPHONE AND YOGA ON WORRY, ANXIETY, SLEEP, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, FATIGUE, PHYSICAL FUNCTION, SOCIAL PARTICIPATION, AND PAIN; AND EXAMINED PREFERENCE AND SELECTION EFFECTS. DESIGN: IN THIS RANDOMIZED PREFERENCE TRIAL, PARTICIPANTS (N = 500) WERE RANDOMIZED TO A: 1) RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) OF CBT OR YOGA (N = 250); OR 2) PREFERENCE TRIAL (SELECTED CBT OR YOGA; N = 250). OUTCOMES WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE AND WEEK 37. SETTING: COMMUNITY. PARTICIPANTS: COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS (AGE 60+ YEARS). INTERVENTIONS: CBT (BY TELEPHONE) AND YOGA (IN-PERSON GROUP CLASSES). MEASUREMENTS: PENN STATE WORRY QUESTIONNAIRE - ABBREVIATED (WORRY);(1)(,)(2) INSOMNIA SEVERITY INDEX (SLEEP);(3) PROMIS ANXIETY SHORT FORM V1.0 (ANXIETY);(4)(,)(5) GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER SCREENER (GENERALIZED ANXIETY);(6)(,)(7) AND PROMIS-29 (DEPRESSION, FATIGUE, PHYSICAL FUNCTION, SOCIAL PARTICIPATION, PAIN).(8)(,)(9) RESULTS: SIX MONTHS AFTER INTERVENTION COMPLETION, CBT AND YOGA RCT PARTICIPANTS REPORTED SUSTAINED IMPROVEMENTS FROM BASELINE IN WORRY, ANXIETY, SLEEP, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, FATIGUE, AND SOCIAL PARTICIPATION (NO SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCES). USING DATA COMBINED FROM THE RANDOMIZED AND PREFERENCE TRIALS, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT PREFERENCE OR SELECTION EFFECTS. LONG-TERM INTERVENTION EFFECTS WERE OBSERVED AT CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL LEVELS FOR MOST OF THE STUDY OUTCOMES. CONCLUSIONS: CBT AND YOGA BOTH DEMONSTRATED MAINTAINED IMPROVEMENTS FROM BASELINE ON MULTIPLE OUTCOMES SIX MONTHS AFTER INTERVENTION COMPLETION IN A LARGE SAMPLE OF OLDER ADULTS.

12  130  31 A PRAGMATIC CONTROLLED TRIAL OF A BRIEF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED PROGRAM FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS. OBJECTIVES: TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELLBEING IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS THAT ATTENDED A BRIEF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED PROGRAM. DESIGN: PRAGMATIC CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS THAT ATTENDED A YOGA MINDFULNESS-BASED PROGRAM (N = 9) TO A WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 22). SETTING: THE 3-DAY PROGRAM WAS DELIVERED AT THE KRIPALU CENTER FOR YOGA & HEALTH IN MASSACHUSETTS. INTERVENTION: THE 3-DAY YOGA MINDFULNESS PROGRAM INCLUDED 5 HOURS PER DAY OF YOGA, MINDFULNESS EXERCISES, FORMAL MEDITATION, DIDACTIC, AND EXPERIENTIAL ACTIVITIES. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELLBEING WERE COMPLETED BEFORE (BASELINE), IMMEDIATELY AFTER (POST-PROGRAM), AND TWO MONTHS AFTER THE PROGRAM (FOLLOW-UP). RESULTS: RELATIVE TO CONTROLS (N = 21), THE RISE GROUP (N = 9) SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN POSITIVE AFFECT (P = .033), NEGATIVE AFFECT (P = .044), MINDFULNESS (P = .001), EMPOWERMENT (P = .022), SELF-COMPASSION (P = .001), AND WORK ENGAGEMENT FROM BASELINE TO POST-PROGRAM. FROM BASELINE TO FOLLOW-UP, THE RISE GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN STRESS (P = .008), NEGATIVE AFFECT (P = .013), MINDFULNESS (P = .001), EMPOWERMENT (P = .007), AND SELF-COMPASSION (P = .001) COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: THE YOGA MINDFULNESS PROGRAM WAS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN EDUCATORS' PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELLBEING IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING AND 2-MONTHS FOLLOWING THE PROGRAM. FUTURE RESEARCH WITH A LARGER SAMPLE SIZE IS NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE RESULTS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
13  140  36 A PROSPECTIVE STUDY ON TYPE-2 DIABETIC COMPLICATIONS AND EFFICACY OF INTEGRATED YOGA: A PAN INDIA 2017. BACKGROUND: TYPE 2 DIABETES (T2DM) CONTRIBUTES TO HIGH MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY BECAUSE OF ITS MAJOR COMPLICATIONS RELATED TO KIDNEY, HEART, BRAIN, AND EYES. IT ALSO POSES A HIGH RISK FOR MORTALITY BECAUSE OF COVID-19. STUDIES SUGGEST THE POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS OF YOGA IN DELAYING OR ATTENUATING SUCH COMPLICATIONS. METHODOLOGY: THIS WAS A PAN-INDIA MULTI CENTERED CLUSTER-RANDOMIZED (4 LEVEL) TWO-ARMED TRIAL IN THE RURAL AND URBAN POPULATION OF ALL POPULOUS STATES OF INDIA. DATA WERE OBTAINED USING MOBILE APP IN ALL ADULTS IN THE HOUSEHOLD OF THE SELECTED CLUSTERS. RESULTS: WE REPORT THE DIABETES RELATED COMPLICATIONS IN 16623 ADULTS (48% MALES, 52% FEMALES) FROM 65 DISTRICTS (1 IN 10 DISTRICTS, 2011 CENSUS) OF 29 (OUT OF 35) STATES AND UNION TERRITORIES OF INDIA; MEAN AGE WAS 48.2 +/- 12.46 YEARS. OUT OF THIS 40% LIVED IN RURAL AND 62% IN URBAN LOCATIONS. IN HIGH RISK DIABETES INDIVIDUALS (SCORED >/= 60 POINTS ON INDIAN DIABETES RISK SCORE KEY), 18.0% HAD SELF-REPORTED HISTORY OF (PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY, 6.1% HAD H/O MAJOR STROKES, 5.5% HAD MINOR STROKES (TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC EPISODES), 18.1% HAD LOWER LIMB CLAUDICATION, 20.5% LEG ULCERS, 4.4% HAD H/O CARDIAC SURGERY, 4.8% ANGIOPLASTY, AND 15.1% HAD DIABETES RETINOPATHY. COMPLICATIONS WERE HIGHER IN RURAL THAN IN URBAN AREAS, HIGHER IN PEOPLE WITH EXTENDED DURATION OF DIABETES. INTEGRATED YOGA MODULE FOR THREE MONTHS (ONE HOUR DAILY) SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER REDUCTION IN SYMPTOMS RELATED TO COMPLICATIONS AS COMPARED TO CONTROL GROUP (P < .001). CONCLUSION: THE ALARMING HIGH PREVALENCE OF COMPLICATIONS IN DIABETES POPULATION CALLS FOR URGENT ACTION, WHERE YOGA MAY SHOW THE BENEFITS IN REDUCTION OF SYMPTOMS OF COMPLICATIONS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
14 2334  31 TWELVE-WEEK YOGA VS. AEROBIC CYCLING INITIATION IN SEDENTARY HEALTHY SUBJECTS: A BEHAVIORAL AND MULTIPARAMETRIC INTERVENTIONAL PET/MR STUDY. INTERVENTIONAL YOGA STUDIES WITH AN ACTIVE CONTROL GROUP REMAIN SCARCE AND ARE IMPORTANT TO CLARIFY THE UNDERLYING NEUROBIOLOGY. WE CONDUCTED AN INTERVENTIONAL STUDY IN HEALTHY CONTROLS USING SIMULTANEOUS POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY/MAGNETIC RESONANCE (PET/MR) IMAGING AND PSYCHOMETRIC SCALES. THIRTY HEALTHY, FEMALE VOLUNTEERS (28.4 +/- 8.4 YEARS) PARTICIPATED AND WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A 12-WEEK YOGA OR INDOOR CYCLING INTERVENTION. BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION, [(18)F]FDG AND [(11)C]UCB-J PET WAS PERFORMED ON A SIMULTANEOUS GE SIGNA PET/MR WITH VOLUMETRIC IMAGING. PSYCHOMETRIC SCALES WERE EVALUATED ON AFFECT, MINDFULNESS, STRESS, WORRYING, SELF-COMPASSION, AND INTEROCEPTIVE AWARENESS. YOGA SUBJECTS SCORED HIGHER ON INTEROCEPTIVE AWARENESS COMPARED TO BASELINE (P < 0.001). COGNITIVE (P = 0.009) AND OVERALL COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING (P = 0.01) IMPROVED AFTER THE YOGA INTERVENTION COMPARED TO THE CYCLING GROUP. WE DID NOT OBSERVE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN GLUCOSE METABOLISM, SYNAPTIC DENSITY, OR GRAY MATTER (GM) VOLUME. THE INDOOR CYCLING GROUP DID NOT SHOW CHANGES IN PSYCHOMETRIC VARIABLES, BUT SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN RELATIVE GLUCOSE METABOLISM WERE OBSERVED IN THE PARAHIPPOCAMPAL/FUSIFORM GYRUS AND CEREBELLUM (P < 0.001). IN CONCLUSION, 12 WEEKS OF YOGA PRACTICE HAS SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON INTEROCEPTIVE AWARENESS AND PERCEIVED COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN STARTERS. LONGER INTERVENTIONS AND/OR HIGHER FREQUENCY OF YOGA PRACTICE MAY BE NEEDED TO DETECT CEREBRAL METABOLIC AND/OR MORPHOLOGIC EFFECTS ON THE MACROSCOPIC LEVEL.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
15 1067  45 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON INNER-CITY CHILDREN'S WELL-BEING: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE YOGA'S EFFECTS ON INNER-CITY CHILDREN'S WELL-BEING. METHODS: THIS PILOT STUDY COMPARED FOURTH- AND FIFTH-GRADE STUDENTS AT 2 AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS IN BRONX, NEW YORK. ONE PROGRAM OFFERED YOGA 1 HOUR PER WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS (YOGA) AND THE OTHER PROGRAM (NON-YOGA) DID NOT. PREINTERVENTION AND POSTINTERVENTION EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING WAS ASSESSED BY HARTER'S GLOBAL SELF-WORTH AND PHYSICAL APPEARANCE SUBSCALES, WHICH WERE THE STUDY'S PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED OTHER MEASURES OF EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING ASSESSED BY 2 NEW SCALES: PERCEPTIONS OF PHYSICAL HEALTH AND YOGA TEACHINGS (INCLUDING NEGATIVE BEHAVIORS, POSITIVE BEHAVIORS, AND FOCUSING/RELAXATION SUBSCALES). PREINTERVENTION AND POSTINTERVENTION, PHYSICAL WELLBEING WAS ASSESSED BY MEASURES OF FLEXIBILITY AND BALANCE. SUBJECTIVE RATINGS OFYOGA'S EFFECTS ON WELL-BEING WERE EVALUATED BY AN ADDITIONAL QUESTIONNAIRE COMPLETED BY THE YOGA GROUP ONLY. RESULTS: DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM 78% (N=39) AND 86.5% (N=32) OF POTENTIAL YOGA AND NON-YOGA STUDY ENROLLEES. NO DIFFERENCES IN BASELINE DEMOGRAPHICS WERE FOUND. CONTROLLING FOR PREINTERVENTION WELL-BEING DIFFERENCES USING ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE, WE FOUND THAT CHILDREN IN THE YOGA GROUP HAD BETTER POSTINTERVENTION NEGATIVE BEHAVIORS SCORES AND BALANCE THAN THE NON-YOGA GROUP (P < .05). THE MAJORITY OF CHILDREN PARTICIPATING IN YOGA REPORTED ENHANCED WELLBEING, AS REFLECTED BY PERCEIVED IMPROVEMENTS IN BEHAVIORS DIRECTLY TARGETED BY YOGA (E.G., STRENGTH, FLEXIBILITY, BALANCE). CONCLUSIONS: ALTHOUGH NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND IN THE STUDY'S PRIMARY OUTCOMES (GLOBAL SELF-WORTH AND PERCEPTIONS OF PHYSICAL WELL-BEING), CHILDREN PARTICIPATING IN YOGA REPORTED USING FEWER NEGATIVE BEHAVIORS IN RESPONSE TO STRESS AND HAD BETTER BALANCE THAN A COMPARISON GROUP. IMPROVEMENTS IN WELLBEING, SPECIFICALLY IN BEHAVIORS DIRECTLY TARGETED BY YOGA, WERE REPORTED. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST A POSSIBLE ROLE OF YOGA AS A PREVENTIVE INTERVENTION AS WELL AS A MEANS OF IMPROVING CHILDREN'S PERCEIVED WELL-BEING.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
16 2234  32 THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON TEACHERS' SELF-RATED EMOTIONS. OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS (I) IF TEACHERS' AGE OR GENDER COULD PREDICT THEIR BASELINE LEVELS OF MENTAL WELL-BEING AND ANXIETY AND ANY CHANGE AFTER YOGA. (II) WHETHER MENTAL WELL-BEING OR ANXIETY CHANGED FOLLOWING 15 DAYS OF YOGA IN PRIMARY SCHOOL TEACHERS. PRIMARY SCHOOL TEACHERS TOOK PART IN THIS SINGLE GROUP LONGITUDINAL TRIAL (N = 302, GROUP MEAN AGE +/- SD; 41.8 +/- 5.90 YEARS). THEY RECEIVED 240 MIN OF YOGA PRACTICE AND 120 MIN OF YOGA THEORY EACH DAY. AT BASELINE AND AFTER 15 DAYS OF YOGA THE ASSESSMENTS WERE (I) MENTAL WELL-BEING (WARWICK-EDINBURGH SCALE) AND (II) STATE ANXIETY (SPIELBERGER'S STATE TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY). RESULTS: GENDER ACTED AS A SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR FOR MENTAL WELL-BEING SCORES (P = 0.001) AND STATE ANXIETY (P = 0.005) IN THE GROUP AT BASELINE. FEMALES SHOWED HIGHER ANXIETY SCORES AND LOWER MENTAL WELL-BEING SCORES. FOLLOWING YOGA THE TEACHERS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN MENTAL WELL-BEING BY 5.84% AND A DECREASE IN STATE ANXIETY BY 4.48%.

17 1827  37 PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR FEMALE INMATES. FEMALE INMATES INVOLVED IN THE YOGA PRISON PROJECT AT TWO CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES IN SOUTH CAROLINA SERVED AS SUBJECTS. INMATES WERE SELECTED FROM THOSE WHO APPLIED TO PARTICIPATE IN A TEN-WEEK TRAUMA-FOCUSED YOGA PROGRAM. TO CREATE CONTROL AND EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS, INMATES WHO REQUESTED TO PARTICIPATE WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO BE IN THE CLASS (TREATMENT GROUP, N = 33) OR A WAITLIST (CONTROL GROUP, N = 17). INMATES ON THE WAITLIST SUBSEQUENTLY JOINED THE NEXT CLASS, SO ALL WHO APPLIED AND WERE ELIGIBLE PARTICIPATED IN A YOGA CLASS. MEASURES OF STRESS, DEPRESSION, SELF CONTROL, ANXIETY, SELF AWARENESS AND RUMINATION WERE USED AND DATA WAS COLLECTED FROM BOTH GROUPS BEFORE THE INITIAL YOGA CLASS BEGAN AND AGAIN AT THE END, TEN WEEKS LATER. TO ASSESS THE CHANGES FROM PRE-INTERVENTION TO POST-INTERVENTION, MIXED DESIGN ANOVA TESTS WERE CONDUCTED. INMATES IN THE YOGA GROUP REPORTED SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN DEPRESSION AND STRESS AND IMPROVED SELF-AWARENESS. NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE FOUND ON MEASURES OF ANXIETY, RUMINATION AND SELF-CONTROL IN THE YOGA GROUPS. ALTHOUGH NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT, ANXIETY SCORES DID DECREASE AND SELF-CONTROL SCORES IMPROVED FOR THE YOGA GROUP, WHILE INMATES IN THE CONTROL GROUP REPORTED A WORSENING OR NO CHANGE ON THESE TWO MEASURES. NO CHANGES WERE FOUND IN RUMINATION LEVELS. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA IS A RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE INTERVENTION THAT COULD BENEFIT BOTH INMATES AND PRISON STAFF BY REDUCING SOME NEGATIVE BEHAVIORS AND POSSIBLY MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
18 1788  37 PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE THAT YOGA PRACTICE PROGRESSIVELY IMPROVES MOOD AND DECREASES STRESS IN A SAMPLE OF UK PRISONERS. OBJECTIVES. IN THE FIRST RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA ON UK PRISONERS, WE PREVIOUSLY SHOWED THAT YOGA PRACTICE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED MENTAL WELLBEING AND COGNITION. HERE, WE AIMED TO ASSESS HOW CLASS ATTENDANCE, SELF-PRACTICE, AND DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS WERE RELATED TO OUTCOME AMONGST PRISONERS ENROLLED IN THE 10-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. METHODS. THE DATA OF 55 PARTICIPANTS (52 MALE, 3 FEMALE) WHO COMPLETED A 10-WEEK YOGA COURSE WERE ANALYSED. CHANGES IN PRE- AND POSTYOGA MEASURES OF AFFECT, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS WERE ENTERED INTO LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSES WITH BIAS-CORRECTED AND ACCELERATED BOOTSTRAP CONFIDENCE INTERVALS. CLASS ATTENDANCE, SELF-PRACTICE, DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES, AND BASELINE PSYCHOMETRIC VARIABLES WERE INCLUDED AS REGRESSORS. RESULTS. PARTICIPANTS WHO ATTENDED MORE YOGA CLASSES AND THOSE WHO ENGAGED IN FREQUENT (5 TIMES OR MORE) SELF-PRACTICE REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER DECREASES IN PERCEIVED STRESS. DECREASES IN NEGATIVE AFFECT WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO HIGH FREQUENCY SELF-PRACTICE AND GREATER CLASS ATTENDANCE AT A NEAR-SIGNIFICANT LEVEL. AGE WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH YOGA CLASS ATTENDANCE, AND HIGHER LEVELS OF EDUCATION WERE ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER DECREASES IN NEGATIVE AFFECT. CONCLUSIONS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THERE MAY BE PROGRESSIVE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA WITHIN PRISON POPULATIONS AND POINT TO SUBPOPULATIONS WHO MAY BENEFIT THE MOST FROM THIS PRACTICE.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
19 1949  34 SCHOOL-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION INCREASES ADOLESCENT RESILIENCE: A PILOT TRIAL. BACKGROUND: YOUTH OFTEN EXPERIENCE STRESSORS LEADING TO NEGATIVE LONG-TERM OUTCOMES. ENHANCING SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL ATTRIBUTES IS IMPORTANT TO FOSTER RESILIENCY TO FACE THESE CHALLENGES. YOGA MAY ENHANCE SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL RESILIENCY AMONG YOUTH. HOWEVER, RESEARCH REPLICATING SUCH RESULTS IN SCHOOL-SETTINGS IS LIMITED. THIS RESEARCH DETAILS AN INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECTS OF THE KRIPALU YOGA IN THE SCHOOLS (KYIS) INTERVENTION INTEGRATED INTO A PHYSICAL EDUCATION CLASS AMONG A RACIALLY/ETHNICALLY DIVERSE STUDENT POPULATION. METHOD: MIDDLE SCHOOL SIXTH GRADE STUDENTS (N = 23 STUDENTS; 52% FEMALE; MEAN AGE = 12.1 YEARS) WERE EITHER ENROLLED IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION CLASS THAT INCLUDED KYIS (N = 9), OR WERE ENROLLED IN ART AND MUSIC (CONTROL CONDITION; N = 14). TO EVALUATE EFFECTS ON STUDENT CHARACTERISTICS, SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES OF SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL COMPETENCE AND PROBLEM BEHAVIOUR WERE ADMINISTERED PRE- AND POST-DELIVERY OF THE CURRICULUM. RESULTS: STUDENTS RECEIVING THE INTERVENTION INCREASED IN SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL COMPETENCE OVER TIME RELATIVE TO THE CONTROL CONDITION. ALTHOUGH PROMISING, RESULTS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION, AS STUDENTS WHO RECEIVED THE YOGA INTERVENTION SCORED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER ON SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL COMPETENCE THAN STUDENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP AT PRE-INTERVENTION MEASUREMENT TIME POINT. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA MAY IMPROVE SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL COMPETENCE AMONG YOUTH AND FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD EXPLORE THE UTILITY OF YOGA CURRICULA IN SCHOOL SETTINGS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
20  390  41 BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL-BEING IN A US HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM: A PRELIMINARY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: TO TEST FEASIBILITY OF YOGA WITHIN A HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM AND EVALUATE PREVENTIVE EFFICACY FOR PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL-BEING. METHODS: GRADE 11 OR 12 STUDENTS (N = 51) WHO REGISTERED FOR PHYSICAL EDUCATION (PE) WERE CLUSTER-RANDOMIZED BY CLASS 2:1 YOGA:PE-AS-USUAL. A KRIPALU-BASED YOGA PROGRAM OF PHYSICAL POSTURES, BREATHING EXERCISES, RELAXATION, AND MEDITATION WAS TAUGHT 2 TO 3 TIMES A WEEK FOR 10 WEEKS. SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES WERE ADMINISTERED TO STUDENTS 1 WEEK BEFORE AND AFTER. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES OF PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL-BEING WERE PROFILE OF MOOD STATES-SHORT FORM AND POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECT SCHEDULE FOR CHILDREN. ADDITIONAL MEASURES OF PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL-BEING INCLUDED PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE AND INVENTORY OF POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL ATTITUDES. SECONDARY MEASURES OF SELF-REGULATORY SKILLS INCLUDED RESILIENCE SCALE, STATE TRAIT ANGER EXPRESSION INVENTORY-2, AND CHILD ACCEPTANCE MINDFULNESS MEASURE. TO ASSESS FEASIBILITY, YOGA STUDENTS COMPLETED A PROGRAM EVALUATION. ANALYSES OF COVARIANCE WERE CONDUCTED BETWEEN GROUPS WITH BASELINE AS THE COVARIATE. RESULTS: ALTHOUGH PE-AS-USUAL STUDENTS SHOWED DECREASES IN PRIMARY OUTCOMES, YOGA STUDENTS MAINTAINED OR IMPROVED. TOTAL MOOD DISTURBANCE IMPROVED IN YOGA STUDENTS AND WORSENED IN CONTROLS (P = .015), AS DID PROFILE OF MOOD STATES-SHORT FORM (POMS-SF) TENSION-ANXIETY SUBSCALE (P = .002). ALTHOUGH POSITIVE AFFECT REMAINED UNCHANGED IN BOTH, NEGATIVE AFFECT SIGNIFICANTLY WORSENED IN CONTROLS WHILE IMPROVING IN YOGA STUDENTS (P = .006). SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT. STUDENTS RATED YOGA FAIRLY HIGH, DESPITE MODERATE ATTENDANCE. CONCLUSIONS: IMPLEMENTATION WAS FEASIBLE AND STUDENTS GENERALLY FOUND IT BENEFICIAL. ALTHOUGH NOT CAUSAL DUE TO SMALL, UNEVEN SAMPLE SIZE, THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY SUGGESTS PREVENTIVE BENEFITS IN PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL-BEING FROM KRIPALU YOGA DURING HIGH SCHOOL PE. THESE RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED STUDIES OF YOGA IN SCHOOL SETTINGS.	2012

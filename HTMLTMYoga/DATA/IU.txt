1 2212 116 THE HIGH DOSE OF VITAMIN D SUPPLEMENTATION COMBINED WITH YOGA TRAINING IMPROVE THE LEUKOCYTES CELL SURVIVAL-RELATED GENE EXPRESSION IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. BACKGROUND: THIS STUDY AIMED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING COMBINED WITH VITAMIN D SUPPLEMENTATION ON THE EXPRESSION OF SURVIVAL-RELATED GENES IN LEUKOCYTES AND PSYCHO-PHYSICAL STATUS IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. METHODS: THIRTY BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR WOMEN (AGE, 48 +/- 8 YRS) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED INTO THREE GROUPS: HIGH DOSE (4000 IU) OF VITAMIN D SUPPLEMENTATION (HD) (N = 10); YOGA TRAINING WITH A HIGH DOSE OF VITAMIN D (Y + HD); (N = 10); YOGA TRAINING WITH A LOW DOSE (2000 IU) OF VITAMIN D (Y + LD) (N = 10). PARTICIPANTS PERFORMED THE HATHA YOGA STYLE TWICE A WEEK. BLOOD SAMPLES AND A BATTERY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL TESTS WERE TAKEN BEFORE AND AFTER THE COMPLETION OF INTERVENTIONS. EXPRESSION OF P53, NF-KAPPAB, BCL2, AND BAX GENES WAS MEASURED IN LEUKOCYTES. RESULTS: BODY FAT PERCENTAGE (ETAP2 = 0.36), SHOULDER FLEXIBILITY (ETAP2 = 0.38), ROCKPORT WALK TESTS (ETAP2 = 0.49), AND ANXIETY (ETAP2 = 0.52) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED IN BOTH THE Y + HD AND Y + LD GROUPS COMPARED TO THE HD GROUP (P < 0.05). P53 WAS SIGNIFICANTLY OVER-EXPRESSED IN THE Y + HD GROUP WHILE BCL2 UPREGULATED IN BOTH THE Y + HD AND Y + LD GROUPS. NF-KAPPAB AND BAX EXPRESSION DOWNREGULATED IN ALL GROUPS BUT WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. CONCLUSION: YOGA TRAINING COMBINED WITH LOW AND HIGH DOSES OF VD IMPROVED PHYSICAL FITNESS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASURES WHILE ONLY IN COMBINATION WITH A HIGH DOSE OF VD POSITIVELY MODIFIED THE LEUKOCYTES CELL SURVIVAL-RELATED GENE EXPRESSION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
2 1966  74 SERUM AND GENE EXPRESSION PROFILE OF CYTOKINES FOLLOWING COMBINATION OF YOGA TRAINING AND VITAMIN D SUPPLEMENTATION IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: THIS STUDY AIMED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF THE COMBINATION OF YOGA TRAINING WITH HIGH VITAMIN D DOSE SUPPLEMENTATION ON THE EXPRESSION AND SYSTEMIC LEVELS OF INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES AND PSYCHOPHYSICAL STATUS OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. METHODS: THIRTY VOLUNTEERED BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS (48 +/- 8 YEARS) WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO A HIGH DOSE (4000 IU) OF VITAMIN D SUPPLEMENTATION (HD) GROUP (N = 10), YOGA WITH A HIGH DOSE OF VITAMIN D (YHD) GROUP (N = 10), AND YOGA WITH A LOW DOSE (2000 IU) OF VITAMIN D (YLD) GROUP (N = 10). PARTICIPANTS PERFORMED THE HATHA YOGA STYLE FOR 12 WEEKS, TWICE A WEEK. BLOOD SAMPLES, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) QUESTIONNAIRE, AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE TESTS WERE TAKEN BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION. RESULTS: BODY FAT PERCENTAGE (ETAP(2) = 0.36), HANDGRIP STRENGTH (ETAP(2) = 0.41) AND QOL INDICATORS INCLUDE GLOBAL HEALTH (ETAP(2) = 0.54), FUNCTIONAL SCALES (ETAP(2) = 0.49), AND SYMPTOMS SCALES (ETAP(2) = 0.50) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED IN THE BOTH YHD AND YLD GROUPS COMPARED TO THE HD GROUP (P < 0.05). ALSO, INTERLEUKIN-10 (IL-10) LEVELS WERE MARKEDLY INCREASED IN THE Y-HVD GROUP COMPARED TO THE Y-LVD AND HVD GROUPS. MOREOVER, THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR-ALPHA (TNF-ALPHA) AND INTERLEUKIN-6 LEVELS IN THE Y-HVD GROUP AFTER THE INTERVENTION. THE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY INDEX (IL-10/TNF-ALPHA) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN BOTH THE YOGA GROUPS (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: YOGA PROMOTES PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FITNESS AND, IN COMBINATION WITH A HIGH DOSE OF VITAMIN D, IMPROVES THE CYTOKINE PROFILE, WHICH CAN EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE SIDE EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH CANCER.

3  791  28 EFFECT OF YOGA EXERCISE THERAPY ON OXIDATIVE STRESS INDICATORS WITH END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE ON HEMODIALYSIS. BACKGROUND: OXIDATIVE STRESS PROMOTES ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION AND ATHEROSCLEROSIS IN CHRONIC RENAL DISEASE. OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE IMPACT OF HATHA YOGA ON OXIDATIVE STRESS INDICATORS AND OXIDANT STATUS, IN PATIENTS WITH END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE (ESRD) ON HEMODIALYSIS. DESIGN: THIS PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED STUDY CONSISTED OF 33 ESRD PATIENTS IN THE HATHA YOGA EXERCISE GROUP WHO WERE MATCHED WITH 35 ESRD PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE OXIDATIVE STRESS INDICATORS (MALONDIALDEHYDE - MDA, PROTEIN OXIDATION - POX, PHOSPHOLIPASE A2 - PLA2 ACTIVITY) AND THE OXIDATIVE STATUS (SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE (SOD) AND CATALASE ACTIVITIES) WERE DETERMINED IN THE BLOOD SAMPLES TAKEN AT THE PRE-HEMODIALYSIS TREATMENT, AT BASELINE (0 MONTHS) AND AFTER FOUR MONTHS. RESULTS: IN PATIENTS IN THE HATHA YOGA EXERCISE GROUP, LIPID PEROXIDATION, AS INDICATED BY MDA DECREASED BY 4.0% AFTER FOUR MONTHS (P = 0.096). THERE WAS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE ACTIVITY OF PLA FROM 2.68 +/- 0.02 IU / L TO 2.34 IU / L (- 12.7%; P = 0.010) AND POX FROM 2.28 +/- 0.02 NMOL / MG TO 2.22 +/- 0.01 NMOL / MG (- 22.6%; P = 0.0001). THE ACTIVITY OF SOD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FROM 12.91 +/- 0.17 U / L TO 13.54 +/- 0.15 U / L (4.65%; P = 0.0001) AND CATALASE FROM 79.83 +/- 0.63 U / L TO 80.54 +/- 0.80 U / L (0.90%; P = 0.0001). THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION BETWEEN THE PRE-HEMODIALYSIS OXIDATIVE STRESS PARAMETERS AT THE ZERO MONTH AND AFTER FOUR MONTHS FOR THE ACTIVITIES OF PLA (R = 0.440), CATALASE (R = 0.872), AND SOD (R = 0.775). CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE HATHA YOGA EXERCISE HAS THERAPEUTIC, PREVENTATIVE, AND PROTECTIVE EFFECTS IN ESRD SUBJECTS, BY DECREASING OXIDATIVE STRESS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
4  986  31 EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA EXERCISE ON PLASMA MALONDIALDEHYDE CONCENTRATION AND SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE ACTIVITY IN FEMALE PATIENTS WITH SHOULDER PAIN. [PURPOSE] THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ANALYZE THE EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA EXERCISE ON PLASMA MALONDIALDEHYDE (MDA) CONCENTRATION AND SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE (SOD) ACTIVITY IN FEMALE PATIENTS WITH SHOULDER PAIN. [SUBJECTS] SUBJECTS COMPRISED 20 FEMALE PATIENTS WITH SHOULDER PAIN. [METHODS] SUBJECTS WERE DIVIDED INTO 2 GROUPS: A HATHA YOGA EXERCISE GROUP (N = 10) AND A CONTROL GROUP THAT PERFORMED NO EXERCISE (N = 10). THE SUBJECTS' BODY COMPOSITION, PLASMA MALONDIALDEHYDE CONCENTRATIONS, AND SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE ACTIVITIES WERE MEASURED BEFORE AND AFTER A 16-WEEK HATHA YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM. [RESULTS] AFTER THE 16-WEEK HATHA YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM, THE EXERCISE GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER PLASMA MDA CONCENTRATIONS THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. IN ADDITION, THE EXERCISE GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PLASMA SOD ACTIVITY THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. [CONCLUSIONS] HATHA YOGA EXERCISE IMPROVES FLEXIBILITY, MUSCLE TONE AND STRENGTH, BALANCE, AND JOINT FUNCTION. OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT REGULAR AND CONTINUOUS YOGA EXERCISE EFFECTIVELY IMPROVED BODY COMPOSITION, DECREASE PLASMA MDA CONCENTRATION, AND INCREASE PLASMA SOD ACTIVITY IN FEMALE PATIENTS WITH SHOULDER PAIN.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
5  799  29 EFFECT OF YOGA MODULE ON PRO-INFLAMMATORY AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES IN INDUSTRIAL WORKERS OF LONAVLA: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: INFLAMMATORY MARKERS PLAY A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN BODY'S DEFENSE MECHANISM. PRO-INFLAMMATORY MARKERS AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY MARKERS COUNTERBALANCE EACH OTHER. IT IS EXTREMELY ESSENTIAL FOR THE BODY TO MAINTAIN THEIR BALANCE FOR A GOOD IMMUNE RESPONSE. OBJECTIVES: TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICES ON SELECTED PRO-INFLAMMATORY AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE AMONG INDUSTRIAL WORKERS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FORTY EIGHT MALE STUDY PARTICIPANTS, AGED 30-58 YEARS, WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO EXPERIMENTAL (N=24) & CONTROL (N=24) GROUPS. PRO-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE IL-1BETA AND ANTI-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE IL-10 WERE EVALUATED AT THE BASELINE AND AT THE END OF 12 WK OF YOGA TRAINING IN BOTH THE GROUPS. DURING THE EXPERIMENTAL STUDY, ALL THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS CONTINUED WITH THEIR DAILY LIFESTYLE AND DIET. DATA WERE ANALYSED USING PAIRED T-TEST AND INDEPENDENT T-TEST. RESULTS: THE RESULT OF WITHIN GROUP COMPARISON REVEALED THAT THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN IL-1 BETA WHILE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN IL-10 (P < 0.05), WHEREAS THE CONTROL GROUP REVEALED NO CHANGE IN IL-1 BETA (P > 0.05) AND IL-10 (P > 0.05). FURTHER, THE RESULTS BETWEEN THE GROUPS CONFIRMED THAT THE YOGA GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER LEVEL OF IL-1 BETA AND INCREASE IN IL-10 AS COMPARED TO CONTROL GROUP (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: THE PRESENT STUDY HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT YOGA PRACTICES COULD REDUCE PRO-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE AND INCREASE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE IN INDUSTRIAL WORKERS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
6  675  40 EFFECT OF A SIX-MONTH YOGA EXERCISE INTERVENTION ON FITNESS OUTCOMES FOR BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. YOGA-BASED EXERCISE HAS PROVEN TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR PRACTITIONERS, INCLUDING CANCER SURVIVORS. THIS STUDY REPORTS ON THE IMPROVEMENTS IN PHYSICAL FITNESS FOR 20 BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WHO PARTICIPATED IN A SIX-MONTH YOGA-BASED EXERCISE PROGRAM (YE). RESULTS ARE COMPARED TO A COMPREHENSIVE EXERCISE (CE) PROGRAM GROUP AND A COMPARISON (C) EXERCISE GROUP WHO CHOSE THEIR OWN EXERCISES. "PRE" AND "POST" FITNESS ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED MEASURES OF ANTHROPOMETRICS, CARDIORESPIRATORY CAPACITY, STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS, EFFECT SIZE (D), DEPENDENT SAMPLE 'T' TESTS FOR ALL OUTCOME MEASURES WERE CALCULATED FOR THE YE GROUP. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDED: DECREASED % BODY FAT (-3.00%, D = -0.44, P < 0.001); INCREASED SIT TO STAND LEG STRENGTH REPETITIONS (2.05, D = 0.48, P = 0.003); FORWARD REACH (3.59 CM, D = 0.61, P = 0.01); AND RIGHT ARM SAGITTAL RANGE OF MOTION (6.50 DEGREES , D = 0.92, P = 0.05). TO COMPARE YE OUTCOMES WITH THE OTHER TWO GROUPS, A ONE-WAY ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA) WAS USED. YE PARTICIPANTS SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPERFORMED C PARTICIPANTS ON "FORWARD REACH" (3.59 CM GAINED VERSUS -2.44 CM LOST), (P = 0.009) AND OUTPERFORMED CE PARTICIPANTS (3.59 CM GAINED VERSUS 1.35 CM GAINED), BUT NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. OUR RESULTS SUPPORT YOGA-BASED EXERCISE MODIFIED FOR BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS AS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
7  389  33 BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN HEART FAILURE PATIENTS. BACKGROUND: THE NUMBER OF AFRICAN AMERICAN (AA) PATIENTS LIVING WITH HEART FAILURE (HF) HAS BEEN INCREASING, ESPECIALLY AMONG THE ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED. YOGA THERAPY HAS BEEN FOUND TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS AMONG HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS, BUT ITS EFFECT IN PATIENTS WITH HF REMAINS UNKNOWN. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY ON CARDIOVASCULAR ENDURANCE (VO2PEAK), FLEXIBILITY, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), AND INFLAMMATORY MARKERS ON MEDICALLY STABLE HF PATIENTS. METHODS: FORTY PATIENTS (38 AA, 1 ASIAN, AND 1 CAUCASIAN) WITH SYSTOLIC OR DIASTOLIC HF WERE RANDOMIZED TO THE YOGA GROUP (YG, N = 21) OR THE CONTROL GROUP (CG, N = 19). ALL PATIENTS WERE ASKED TO FOLLOW A HOME WALK PROGRAM. PREMEASUREMENT AND POSTMEASUREMENT INCLUDED A TREADMILL STRESS TEST TO PEAK EXERTION, FLEXIBILITY, INTERLEUKIN-6 (IL-6), C-REACTIVE PROTEIN (CRP), AND EXTRACELLULAR SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE (EC-SOD). QOL WAS ASSESSED BY THE MINNESOTA LIVING WITH HEART FAILURE QUESTIONNAIRE (MLWHFQ). RESULTS: THE STATISTICAL ANALYSES (ASSESSED BY ANOVA AND T-TESTS) WERE SIGNIFICANT FOR FAVORABLE CHANGES IN THE YG, COMPARED WITH THOSE IN THE CG, FOR FLEXIBILITY (P = 0.012), TREADMILL TIME (P = 0.002), VO2PEAK (P = 0.003), AND THE BIOMARKERS (IL-6, P = 0.004; CRP, P = 0.016; AND EC-SOD, P = 0.012). WITHIN THE YG, PRETEST TO POSTTEST SCORES FOR THE TOTAL (P = 0.02) AND PHYSICAL SUBSCALES (P < 0.001) OF THE MLWHFQ WERE IMPROVED. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA THERAPY OFFERED ADDITIONAL BENEFITS TO THE STANDARD MEDICAL CARE OF PREDOMINANTLY AA HF PATIENTS BY IMPROVING CARDIOVASCULAR ENDURANCE, QOL, INFLAMMATORY MARKERS, AND FLEXIBILITY.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
8  881  31 EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES AND C-REACTIVE PROTEIN IN EMPLOYEES OF SMALL-SCALE INDUSTRIES. OBJECTIVE: THE PRESENT STUDY INTENDS TO SEE THE EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICES ON LIPID PROFILE, INTERLEUKIN (IL)-6, TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR (TNF)-ALPHA, AND HIGH-SENSITIVITY-C-REACTIVE PROTEIN (HS-CRP) AMONG APPARENTLY HEALTHY ADULTS EXPOSED TO OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IN THE PRESENT STUDY, 48 PARTICIPANTS AGED 30-58 YEARS (41.5 +/- 5.2) WHO WERE EXPOSED TO OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS, THAT IS, EXPERIMENTAL AND WAIT-LIST CONTROL. ALL THE PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSESSED FOR LIPID PROFILE, IL-6, TNF-ALPHA, AND HS-CRP AT THE BASELINE AND AFTER COMPLETION OF 3 MONTHS OF YOGA TRAINING INTERVENTION. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP UNDERWENT YOGA TRAINING INTERVENTION FOR 1 H FOR 6 DAYS A WEEK FOR 3 MONTHS, WHEREAS CONTROL GROUP CONTINUED WITH THEIR DAILY ACTIVITIES EXCEPT YOGA TRAINING. DATA ANALYSIS WAS DONE USING STATISTICAL SOFTWARE SPSS VERSION 20.0. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING PAIRED T-TESTS AND INDEPENDENT T-TEST. RESULTS: THE RESULTS OF WITHIN GROUP COMPARISON REVEALED HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN CHOLESTEROL (P < 0.001), HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (P < 0.001), LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (LDL)(P < 0.01), HS-CRP (P < 0.01), IL-6 (P < 0.001), AND TNF-ALPHA (P < 0.001) IN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP. COMPARISON BETWEEN EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUP REVEALED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN CHOLESTEROL (P < 0.01), LDL (P < 0.05), IL-6 (P < 0.01), TNF-ALPHA (P < 0.01), AND HS-CRP (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: A YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION SEEMS TO BE A HIGHLY PROMISING ALTERNATIVE THERAPY WHICH FAVORABLY ALTERS INFLAMMATORY MARKERS AND METABOLIC RISK FACTORS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
9  276  34 ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENT OF RESPIRATORY TECHNIQUE ON VASCULAR FUNCTION IN HYPERTENSIVE POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN FOLLOWING YOGA OR STRETCHING VIDEO CLASSES: THE YOGINI STUDY. BACKGROUND: HYPERTENSION REMAINS HIGHLY PREVALENT IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN, ALONG WITH VASCULAR DYSFUNCTION AND INCREASED OXIDATIVE STRESS. IN SUCH CONTEXT, REGULAR EXERCISES, YOGA PRACTICE, AND SLOW BREATHING HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED TO TREAT HYPERTENSION. HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS OF THE MULTIPLE COMPONENTS OF YOGA, INCLUDING THE RESPIRATORY TECHNIQUES INVOLVED IN THE PRACTICE, ON HYPERTENSION AND ON VASCULAR AND ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION HAVE NEVER BEEN EVALUATED. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE ADDITIONAL EFFECTS OF RESPIRATORY TECHNIQUE ON VASCULAR FUNCTION AND OXIDATIVE STRESS PROFILE IN HYPERTENSIVE POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN (HPMWS) FOLLOWING YOGA OR STRETCHING VIDEO CLASSES. STUDY DESIGN: HYPERTENSIVE POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WERE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED FOR 12 WEEKS, TWICE A WEEK, OF SUPERVISED YOGA OR STRETCHING VIDEO CLASSES OF 75 MIN FOR 12 WEEKS ASSOCIATED OR NOT WITH RESPIRATORY TECHNIQUE. BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION MEASUREMENTS INCLUDED PULSE WAVE VELOCITY (PWV), FLOW-MEDIATED DILATION (FMD), AND OXIDATIVE STRESS PARAMETERS. HYPERTENSIVE POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN (59 +/- 0.7 YEARS) WHO ENDED THE PROTOCOL WERE DISTRIBUTED INTO THREE GROUPS: (1) CONTROL GROUP (YOGA OR STRETCHING, C, N = 14); (2) YOGA + RESPIRATORY TECHNIQUE (Y+, N = 10); (3) STRETCHING + RESPIRATORY TECHNIQUE (S+, N = 9). RESULTS: DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND FMD [BASELINE: C: 6.94 +/- 1.97%, Y+: 7.05 +/- 1.65%, AND S+: 3.54 +/- 2.01% VS. POST: C: 16.59 +/- 3.46% (P = 0.006), Y+: 13.72 +/- 2.81% (P = 0.005), AND S+: 11.79 +/- 0.99% (P = 0.0001)] HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN ALL GROUPS WHEN BASELINE AND POST-PRACTICE VALUES WERE COMPARED. HOWEVER, RESTING HEART RATE AND PWV [BASELINE: Y+: 10.44 +/- 3.69 AND S+: 9.50 +/- 0.53 M/S VS. POST: Y+: 9.45 +/- 0.39 (P = 0.003) AND S+: 8.02 +/- 0.47 M/S (P = 0.003)] DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY ONLY IN THE Y+ AND S+ GROUPS (BASELINE VS. POST). SYSTEMIC ANTIOXIDANT ENZYME ACTIVITIES (SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE AND CATALASE) INCREASED IN ALL GROUPS, AND HYDROGEN PEROXIDE AND LIPOPEROXIDATION REDUCED IN Y+ AND S+ (BASELINE VS. POST). CONCLUSIONS: TWELVE WEEKS OF YOGA OR STRETCHING VIDEO CLASSES PROMOTED POSITIVE CHANGES IN SEVERAL OUTCOMES GENERALLY REGARDED AS CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS IN HPMWS, AND THESE CHANGES WERE EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED BY THE ASSOCIATION WITH RESPIRATORY TECHNIQUE.	2020	

10  268  31 ACUTE PHYSIOLOGIC EFFECTS OF PERFORMING YOGA IN THE HEAT ON ENERGY EXPENDITURE, RANGE OF MOTION, AND INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS. PERFORMING YOGA IN A HEATED ENVIRONMENT (HY) IS A POPULAR EXERCISE MODE PURPORTED TO IMPROVE RANGE OF MOTION (ROM), BODY COMPOSITION, AND AEROBIC FITNESS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS INVESTIGATION WAS TO COMPARE A SESSION OF HY TO ROOM TEMPERATURE YOGA (RTY) WITH REGARDS TO ROM, OXYGEN CONSUMPTION, CALORIC EXPENDITURE, AND BIOMARKERS OF ACUTE STRESS AND INFLAMMATION. SIXTEEN EXPERIENCED YOGA PRACTITIONERS (F14, M2; 40 +/- 11YR; 22.6 +/- 1.8 KG/M(2)) COMPLETED A 1-HOUR STANDARDIZED BIKRAM SEQUENCE IN HY (105 DEGREES F, 40 DEGREES C) AND RTY (74 DEGREES F, 23.3 DEGREES C) CONDITIONS (ORDER OF CONDITIONS RANDOMIZED, HUMIDITY STANDARDIZED AT 40%). INTRA-EXERCISE METABOLIC GAS EXCHANGE AND HEART RATE (HR) WAS MONITORED USING A METABOLIC CART. ROM MEASURES WERE TAKEN PRE AND POST-EXERCISE AT THE ELBOW, SHOULDER, HIP, AND KNEE. CYTOKINES INTERLEUKIN 6,10 (IL-6, IL-10) AND TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR ALPHA (TNF-ALPHA) WERE ANALYZED FROM BLOOD SAMPLES COLLECTED PRE- AND 30-MINUTES POST-EXERCISE. INTRA-EXERCISE METABOLIC GAS EXCHANGE AND HEART RATE (HR) WAS MONITORED USING A METABOLIC CART. BOTH BOUTS ELICITED SIMILAR ACUTE CHANGES IN ROM ALTHOUGH HY ELICITED A GREATER INCREASE IN HIP ABDUCTION (RTYDELTA DEGREES = 2.3 +/- 1.3|HYDELTA DEGREES = 6.6 +/- 1.5; P < 0.05). MEAN VO2, PEAK VO2, %VO2MAX, HR, AND KCAL EXPENDITURE DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN CONDITIONS. RER WAS LOWER DURING THE HY (RTY = 0.95 +/- 0.02| HY = 0.89 +/- 0.02; P < 0.05) WITH A CONCOMITANT ELEVATION IN FAT OXIDATION (RTY = 0.05 +/- 0.01|HY = 0.09 +/- 0.01, G.MIN(-1); P < 0.05) AND DECREASE IN CARBOHYDRATE OXIDATION (RTY = 0.51 +/- 0.04|HY = 0.44 +/- 0.03, G.MIN(-1); P < 0.05). SERUM IL-6 WAS INCREASED (15.5 +/- 8.0-FOLD) FOLLOWING HY ONLY (P < 0.05). HY DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY ELEVATE AEROBIC ENERGY COST COMPARED TO RTY BUT MAY ACUTELY INCREASE FAT SUBSTRATE UTILIZATION AND HIP ROM. FUTURE STUDIES REMAIN NEEDED TO ESTABLISH DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIPS FOR INCLUDING HY OR RTY INTO WELL-ROUNDED FITNESS PROGRAMS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
11  995  37 EFFECTS OF HIGH-INTENSITY HATHA YOGA ON CARDIOVASCULAR FITNESS, ADIPOCYTOKINES, AND APOLIPOPROTEINS IN HEALTHY STUDENTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. BACKGROUND: YOGA EXERCISES ARE OFTEN USED AS A FORM OF BODY AND MIND EXERCISE TO INCREASE PERFORMANCE. HOWEVER, KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE PHYSIOLOGIC EFFECTS OF PERFORMING HIGH-INTENSITY HATHA YOGA EXERCISES OVER A LONGER TIME PERIOD REMAINS LIMITED. OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF HIGH-INTENSITY YOGA (HIY) ON CARDIOVASCULAR FITNESS (MAXIMAL OXYGEN CONSUMPTION, ESTIMATED FROM THE COOPER RUNNING TEST), RATINGS OF PERCEIVED EXERTION (RPE), HEART RATE (HR), HEART RATE RECOVERY (HRR), BLOOD PRESSURE (BP), ADIPOCYTOKINES, APOLIPOPROTEIN A1 (APOA1), APOLIPOPROTEIN B (APOB), AND GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN (HBA1C) IN HEALTHY STUDENTS. METHODS: THE 44 PARTICIPANTS (38 WOMEN AND 6 MEN; MEDIAN AGE, 25 YEARS [RANGE, 20-39 YEARS]) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO AN HIY OR A CONTROL GROUP. THE HIY PROGRAM WAS HELD FOR 6 WEEKS (60 MINUTES ONCE A WEEK). CARDIOVASCULAR FITNESS, RPE, HR, HRR, BP, ADIPOCYTOKINES, HBA1C, APOA1, AND APOB WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE AND AFTER 6 WEEKS IN BOTH GROUPS. RESULTS: HIY HAD NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON CARDIOVASCULAR FITNESS (MEAN DOSE: 390 MINUTES [RANGE, 210-800 MINUTES]), HR, HRR, BP, OR ANY OF THE BLOOD PARAMETERS. HOWEVER, SECONDARY FINDINGS SHOWED THAT [CORRECTED] APOA1 (1.47 +/- 0.17 TO 1.55 +/- 0.16 G/L; P = 0.03) AND ADIPONECTIN (8.32 +/- 3.32 TO 9.68 +/- 3.83 MG/L; P = 0.003) LEVELS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE HIY GROUP AFTER 6 WEEKS. CONCLUSIONS: SIX WEEKS OF HIY DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE CARDIOVASCULAR FITNESS. HOWEVER, SECONDARY FINDINGS SHOWED THAT [CORRECTED] APOA1 AND ADIPONECTIN LEVELS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE HIY GROUP. THIS FINDING SUGGESTS THAT HIY MAY HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON BLOOD LIPIDS AND AN ANTI-INFLAMMATORY EFFECT.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
12 1018  37 EFFECTS OF SIX MONTHS OF YOGA ON INFLAMMATORY SERUM MARKERS PROGNOSTIC OF RECURRENCE RISK IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. YOGA-BASED EXERCISE HAS PROVEN TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR PRACTITIONERS, INCLUDING CANCER SURVIVORS. THIS STUDY REPORTS ON THE EFFECT ON INFLAMMATORY BIOLOGICAL MARKERS FOR 20 BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WHO PARTICIPATED IN A SIX-MONTH YOGA-BASED (YE) EXERCISE PROGRAM. RESULTS ARE COMPARED TO A COMPREHENSIVE EXERCISE (CE) PROGRAM GROUP AND A COMPARISON (C) EXERCISE GROUP WHO CHOSE THEIR OWN EXERCISES. "PRE" AND "POST" ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED MEASURES OF ANTHROPOMETRICS, CARDIORESPIRATORY CAPACITY, AND INFLAMMATORY MARKERS INTERLEUKIN 6 (IL-6), INTERLEUKIN 8 (IL-8), TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR ALPHA (TNFALPHA) AND C-REACTIVE PROTEIN (CRP). DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS, EFFECT SIZE (D), AND DEPENDENT SAMPLE 'T' TESTS FOR ALL OUTCOME MEASURES WERE CALCULATED FOR THE YE GROUP. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE SEEN IN DECREASED % BODY FAT, (-3.00%, D = -0.44, P = <.001) BUT NOT IN CARDIORESPIRATORY CAPACITY OR IN INFLAMMATORY SERUM MARKERS. TO COMPARE YE OUTCOMES WITH THE OTHER TWO GROUPS, A ONE-WAY ANALYSIS OF CO-VARIANCE (ANCOVA) WAS USED, CONTROLLING FOR AGE, BMI, CARDIORESPIRATORY CAPACITY AND SERUM MARKER BASELINE VALUES. WE FOUND NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS. MOREOVER, WE DID NOT SEE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ANY INFLAMMATORY MARKER FOR ANY GROUP. OUR RESULTS SUPPORT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA-BASED EXERCISE MODIFIED FOR BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS FOR IMPROVING BODY COMPOSITION. LARGER STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO DETERMINE IF THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN INFLAMMATORY SERUM MARKERS AS A RESULT OF SPECIFIC EXERCISE MODALITIES.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
13 1078  29 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH IN OLDER ADULTS. BACKGROUND: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF A YOGA INTERVENTION ON PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH IN OLDER ADULTS. METHOD: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL STUDY, CONDUCTED AT 2 NORTH FLORIDA FACILITIES FOR OLDER ADULTS. SUBJECTS WERE 98 OLDER ADULTS, AGES 65 TO 92. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO CHAIR YOGA, CHAIR EXERCISE, AND CONTROL GROUPS AND ASSESSED PREINTERVENTION, POSTINTERVENTION, AND 1-MONTH FOLLOW-UP ON THE STATE ANGER EXPRESSION INVENTORY, STATE ANXIETY INVENTORY, GERIATRIC DEPRESSION SCALE, LAWTON'S PGC MORALE SCALE, GENERAL SELF-EFFICACY SCALE, CHRONIC DISEASE SELF-EFFICACY SCALES, AND SELF- CONTROL SCHEDULE. RESULTS: YOGA PARTICIPANTS IMPROVED MORE THAN BOTH EXERCISE AND CONTROL PARTICIPANTS IN ANGER (COHEN'S D = 0.89 FOR YOGA VERSUS EXERCISE, AND 0.90 FOR YOGA VERSUS CONTROL, PRETEST TO POSTTEST; AND D = 0.90 AND 0.72, PRETEST TO FOLLOW-UP), ANXIETY (D = 0.27, 0.39 AND 0.62, 0.63), DEPRESSION (D = 0.47, 0.49 AND 0.53, 0.51), WELL-BEING (D = 0.14, 0.49 AND 0.25, 0.61), GENERAL SELF-EFFICACY (D = 0.63, 1.10 AND 0.30, 0.85), AND SELF-EFFICACY FOR DAILY LIVING (D = 0.52, 0.81 AND 0.27, 0.42). CHANGES IN SELF-CONTROL MODERATED CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH. CONCLUSIONS: OVER A 6-WEEK PERIOD, OUR FINDINGS INDICATE YOGA'S POTENTIAL FOR IMPROVING PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH IN OLDER ADULTS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
14 2836  32 YOGA'S IMPACT ON INFLAMMATION, MOOD, AND FATIGUE IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. PURPOSE: TO EVALUATE YOGA'S IMPACT ON INFLAMMATION, MOOD, AND FATIGUE. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED 3-MONTH TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED WITH TWO POST-TREATMENT ASSESSMENTS OF 200 BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS ASSIGNED TO EITHER 12 WEEKS OF 90-MINUTE TWICE PER WEEK HATHA YOGA CLASSES OR A WAIT-LIST CONTROL. THE MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES WERE LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE-STIMULATED PRODUCTION OF PROINFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES INTERLEUKIN-6 (IL-6), TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR ALPHA (TNF-ALPHA), AND INTERLEUKIN-1BETA (IL-1BETA), AND SCORES ON THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL FATIGUE SYMPTOM INVENTORY-SHORT FORM (MFSI-SF), THE VITALITY SCALE FROM THE MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY 36-ITEM SHORT FORM (SF-36), AND THE CENTER FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES-DEPRESSION (CES-D) SCALE. RESULTS: IMMEDIATELY POST-TREATMENT, FATIGUE WAS NOT LOWER (P > .05) BUT VITALITY WAS HIGHER (P = .01) IN THE YOGA GROUP COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. AT 3 MONTHS POST-TREATMENT, FATIGUE WAS LOWER IN THE YOGA GROUP (P = .002), VITALITY WAS HIGHER (P = .01), AND IL-6 (P = .027), TNF-ALPHA (P = .027), AND IL-1BETA (P = .037) WERE LOWER FOR YOGA PARTICIPANTS COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. GROUPS DID NOT DIFFER ON DEPRESSION AT EITHER TIME (P > .2). PLANNED SECONDARY ANALYSES SHOWED THAT THE FREQUENCY OF YOGA PRACTICE HAD STRONGER ASSOCIATIONS WITH FATIGUE AT BOTH POST-TREATMENT VISITS (P = .019; P < .001), AS WELL AS VITALITY (P = .016; P = .0045), BUT NOT DEPRESSION (P > .05) THAN SIMPLE GROUP ASSIGNMENT; MORE FREQUENT PRACTICE PRODUCED LARGER CHANGES. AT 3 MONTHS POST-TREATMENT, INCREASING YOGA PRACTICE ALSO LED TO A DECREASE IN IL-6 (P = .01) AND IL-1BETA (P = .03) PRODUCTION BUT NOT IN TNF-ALPHA PRODUCTION (P > .05). CONCLUSION: CHRONIC INFLAMMATION MAY FUEL DECLINES IN PHYSICAL FUNCTION LEADING TO FRAILTY AND DISABILITY. IF YOGA DAMPENS OR LIMITS BOTH FATIGUE AND INFLAMMATION, THEN REGULAR PRACTICE COULD HAVE SUBSTANTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
15 2768  33 YOGA REDUCES INFLAMMATORY SIGNALING IN FATIGUED BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS A POPULAR MIND-BODY THERAPY THAT HAS DEMONSTRATED BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON PSYCHOLOGICAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED EFFECTS ON INFLAMMATORY PROCESSES. THIS STUDY TESTED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT AN IYENGAR YOGA INTERVENTION SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR FATIGUED BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WOULD LEAD TO DECREASES IN INFLAMMATION-RELATED GENE EXPRESSION AND CIRCULATING MARKERS OF PROINFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE ACTIVITY. METHODS: BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WITH PERSISTENT CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 12-WEEK IYENGAR YOGA INTERVENTION (N=16) OR A 12-WEEK HEALTH EDUCATION CONTROL CONDITION (N=15). BLOOD SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE, POST-INTERVENTION, AND AT A 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP FOR GENOME-WIDE TRANSCRIPTIONAL PROFILING AND BIOINFORMATIC ANALYSES. PLASMA INFLAMMATORY MARKERS AND SALIVARY CORTISOL WERE ALSO ASSESSED. RESULTS: IN PROMOTER-BASED BIOINFORMATICS ANALYSES, THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED REDUCED ACTIVITY OF THE PRO-INFLAMMATORY TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR NUCLEAR FACTOR KAPPA B (NF-KAPPAB), INCREASED ACTIVITY OF THE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY GLUCOCORTICOID RECEPTOR, AND REDUCED ACTIVITY OF CAMP RESPONSE ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN (CREB) FAMILY TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS RELATIVE TO CONTROLS (ALL PS<.05). THERE WAS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT INTERVENTION EFFECT ON THE SOLUBLE TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR RECEPTOR TYPE II (STNF-RII), A MARKER OF TNF ACTIVITY; PLASMA LEVELS OF STNF-RII REMAINED STABLE IN THE YOGA GROUP, WHEREAS LEVELS OF THIS MARKER INCREASED IN THE HEALTH EDUCATION GROUP (P=.028). A SIMILAR, NON-SIGNIFICANT TREND WAS OBSERVED FOR THE INTERLEUKIN 1 RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST (P=.16). NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN C REACTIVE PROTEIN (CRP), INTERLEUKIN 6 (IL-6), OR DIURNAL CORTISOL MEASURES WERE OBSERVED. CONCLUSIONS: A 12-WEEK RESTORATIVE IYENGAR YOGA INTERVENTION REDUCED INFLAMMATION-RELATED GENE EXPRESSION IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WITH PERSISTENT FATIGUE. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT A TARGETED YOGA PROGRAM MAY HAVE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON INFLAMMATORY ACTIVITY IN THIS PATIENT POPULATION, WITH POTENTIAL RELEVANCE FOR BEHAVIORAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
16 1059  30 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON EXERCISE CAPACITY IN PATIENTS WITH LYMPHANGIOLEIOMYOMATOSIS: A NONRANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON EXERCISE CAPACITY AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH LYMPHANGIOLEIOMYOMATOSIS (LAM), A RARE CYSTIC LUNG DISEASE IN WOMEN. PATIENTS AND METHODS: THIS WAS A NONRANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED STUDY CONDUCTED IN BEIJING, CHINA (AUGUST 27, 2017 - APRIL 26, 2018). TWENTY-SIX PARTICIPANTS WERE ALLOCATED TO THE INTERVENTION (YOGA) GROUP (N = 13) OR CONTROL GROUP (N = 13). THE YOGA INTERVENTION INVOLVED A 24-WEEK PROGRAM OF YOGA CLASS TRAINING FOR 90 MIN ONCE A WEEK AND NO FEWER THAN 2 AT-HOME SESSIONS PER WEEK (AT LEAST 15 MIN PER SESSION). THE 6-MIN WALKING DISTANCE (6MWD), LUNG FUNCTION, SERUM VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH FACTOR-D (VEGF-D) LEVELS, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE, 12-WEEK AND 24-WEEK FOLLOW-UP. AN INCREMENTAL CARDIOPULMONARY EXERCISE TEST WAS CONDUCTED AT BASELINE AND THE 24-WEEK FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: ELEVEN PATIENTS COMPLETED THE YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM. THE YOGA GROUP EXHIBITED IMPROVEMENTS IN THE FOLLOWING OUTCOMES VERSUS THOSE OF THE CONTROL GROUP: 6MWD (+ 55 +/- 29 M VS + 18 +/- 49 M, P = 0.04), ANAEROBIC THRESHOLD (3.4 +/- 2.4 ML/MIN/KG VS 1.6 +/- 1.4 ML/MIN/KG, P = 0.035) AND PEAK WORK LOAD (11.7 +/- 14.6 W VS 0.2 +/- 9.1 W, P = 0.027). THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN PEAK OXYGEN CONSUMPTION (VO2PEAK), LUNG FUNCTION, VEGF-D LEVEL, AND QUALITY OF LIFE BETWEEN THE YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS. NO ADVERSE EFFECTS WERE FOUND IN THE YOGA GROUP. CONCLUSION: YOGA IS A FEASIBLE AND SAFE INTERVENTION FOR PULMONARY REHABILITATION AND POTENTIALLY IMPROVES EXERCISE CAPACITY IN PATIENTS WITH LAM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 60 PATIENTS WITH STABLE HF NEW YORK HEART ASSOCIATION CLASS II WITH LVEF 30%-40% WERE RANDOMIZED INTO CONTROL GROUP (CG) AND YOGA GROUP (YG). CG RECEIVED THE GUIDELINE-BASED THERAPY AND YG IN ADDITION PRACTICED THE YOGA, ONE HOUR DAILY FOR 3 MONTHS. ALL PATIENTS WERE ASSESSED FOR QOL, CRP, NTPROBNP, AND LVEF AT BASELINE AND AFTER 3 MONTHS. RESULTS: A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED IN ALL FOUR PARAMETERS IN THE YG AS COMPARED TO THE CG (P < 0.01) AFTER 12 WEEKS. QOL AS ASSESSED BY MINNESOTA LIVING WITH HEART FAILURE QUESTIONNAIRE SCORE IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY IN YG AS COMPARED TO CG (10 V/S 14, P < 0.001). THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT WITHIN YG IN TERMS OF LVEF (33.4-36.8, P = 0.001), AND THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN LVEF WAS SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN THE GROUPS (10% V/S 5%, P = 0.001). NTPROBNP ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BY 69.8% FROM 755 TO 220 PMOL/L IN YG AS COMPARED TO 39.3% IN CG (679-406 PMOL/L). CRP DECREASED BY 49.3% (5.36-2.73 MG/L) IN YG AND 35.8% (5.39-3.45 MG/L) IN CG. CONCLUSION: THE RESULT OF THIS PILOT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT ADDITION OF YOGA TO GUIDELINE-BASED THERAPY FOR HF PATIENTS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES QOL, LVEF, AND NTPROBNP AND REDUCES CRP LEVEL. LARGER STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE FINDINGS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
19 2507  32 YOGA BASED CARDIAC REHABILITATION AFTER CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS SURGERY: ONE-YEAR RESULTS ON LVEF, LIPID PROFILE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STATES--A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO COMPARE THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA BASED CARDIAC REHABILITATION PROGRAM WITH ONLY PHYSIOTHERAPY BASED PROGRAM AS AN ADD-ON TO CONVENTIONAL REHABILITATION AFTER CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING (CABG) ON RISK FACTORS. METHODS: IN THIS SINGLE BLIND PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED PARALLEL TWO ARMED ACTIVE CONTROL STUDY, 1026 PATIENTS POSTED FOR CABG AT NARAYANA HRUDAYALAYA INSTITUTE OF CARDIAC SCIENCES, BENGALURU (INDIA) WERE SCREENED. OF THESE, 250 MALE PARTICIPANTS (35-65 YEARS) WHO SATISFIED THE SELECTION CRITERIA AND CONSENTED WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS. WITHIN AND BETWEEN GROUP COMPARISONS WERE DONE AT THREE POINTS OF FOLLOW UP (I.E. 6TH WEEK, 6TH MONTH, AND 12TH MONTH) BY USING WILCOXON'S SIGNED RANKS TEST AND MANN WHITNEY U TEST RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS: YOGA GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY (P = 0.001, MANN WHITNEY) BETTER IMPROVEMENT IN LVEF THAN CONTROL GROUP IN THOSE WITH ABNORMAL BASELINE EF (<53%) AFTER 1 YEAR. THERE WAS A BETTER REDUCTION IN BMI IN THE YOGA GROUP (P = 0.038, BETWEEN GROUPS) IN THOSE WITH HIGH BASELINE BMI (>/=23) AFTER 12 MONTHS. YOGA GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT (P = 0.008, WILCOXON'S) REDUCTION IN BLOOD GLUCOSE AT ONE YEAR IN THOSE WITH HIGH BASELINE FBS >/=110 MG/DL. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER IMPROVEMENT IN YOGA THAN THE CONTROL GROUP IN HDL (P = 0.003), LDL (P = 0.01) AND VLDL (P = 0.03) IN THOSE WITH ABNORMAL BASELINE VALUES. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER IMPROVEMENT (P = 0.02, BETWEEN GROUPS) IN POSITIVE AFFECT IN YOGA GROUP. WITHIN YOGA GROUP, THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN PERCEIVED STRESS (P = 0.001), ANXIETY (P = 0.001), DEPRESSION (P = 0.001), AND NEGATIVE AFFECT (P = 0.03) WHILE IN THE CONTROL GROUP THERE WAS REDUCTION (P = 0.003) ONLY IN SCORES ON ANXIETY. CONCLUSION: ADDITION OF YOGA BASED RELAXATION TO CONVENTIONAL POST-CABG CARDIAC REHABILITATION HELPS IN BETTER MANAGEMENT OF RISK FACTORS IN THOSE WITH ABNORMAL BASELINE VALUES AND MAY HELP IN PREVENTING RECURRENCE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
20 2120  35 THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON ENHANCEMENT OF ADRENOCORTICOTROPIC HORMONE (ACTH) AND CORTISOL LEVELS IN FEMALE PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. THE EFFECT OF 8 WEEKS YOGA TRAINING ON CORTISOL AND ADRENOCORTICOTROPIC HORMONE (ACTH) LEVELS IN FEMALE PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) IS EXAMINED. TWENTY FOUR MS FEMALE PATIENTS WITH EXPANDED DISABILITY STATUS SCALE (EDSS) 1 TO 5.5 PARTICIPATED IN THIS STUDY AS THE SUBJECT. THE PARTICIPANTS WERE DIVIDED INTO CONTROL (N = 10) OR TRAINING GROUP (N = 14) RANDOMLY. TRAINING GROUP PERFORMED 90 MIN YOGA TRAINING PER SESSION, 3 DAYS A WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS. ASSESSMENTS INCLUDE BODY COMPOSITION MEASUREMENT AND BLOOD SAMPLING 48 H BEFORE FIRST SESSION AND 48 H AFTER THE INTERVENTION. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THAT ACTH INCREASED AND CORTISOL DECREASED COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP (P < 0.05); IN CONCLUSION, IT SEEMS THAT YOGA TRAINING MODULATES ACTH LEVEL IN CONCOMITANT WITH REDUCTION IN CORTISOL LEVEL IN FEMALE PATIENTS WITH MS.	2017

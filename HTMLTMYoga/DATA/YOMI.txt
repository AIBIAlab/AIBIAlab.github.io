1 2381 113 YIN YOGA AND MINDFULNESS: A FIVE WEEK RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY EVALUATING THE EFFECTS OF THE YOMI PROGRAM ON STRESS AND WORRY. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: THE YOMI PROGRAM IS A PSYCHOEDUCATIONAL TRAINING AND PHYSICAL PRACTICE-BASED PROGRAM THAT BRIDGES KNOWLEDGE FROM EVIDENCE-BASED PSYCHOTHERAPY WITH THE PRACTICE OF MINDFULNESS AND YIN YOGA. IT CONSISTS OF 10 CONTENT-SPECIFIC SESSIONS AND DOES NOT INCLUDE HOME ASSIGNMENTS. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF THE FIVE-WEEK YOMI PROGRAM ON PERCEIVED STRESS, WORRY AND MINDFULNESS IN A NON-CLINICAL SAMPLE. DESIGN AND METHOD: IN THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSIGNED TO TWO GROUPS. GROUP 1 PARTICIPATED IN THE FIVE-WEEK INTERVENTION TWICE A WEEK WHILE GROUP 2 WAS ASSIGNED TO A WAITING-LIST CONDITION AND PARTICIPATED IN THE INTERVENTION AFTER GROUP 1. ALL MEASURES WERE ADMINISTERED THROUGH SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES, CONDUCTED VIA A WEB-BASED PROGRAM. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY INDICATED SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS OF THE YOMI PROGRAM ON DECREASING STRESS AND WORRY, AND INCREASING MINDFULNESS. NOTABLY THESE CHANGES WERE STILL PRESENT AT FIVE-WEEK FOLLOW UP. CONSISTENT WITH THE HYPOTHESES, RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT THE YOMI PROGRAM ESTABLISHED A GROUP SETTING WHERE INDIVIDUALS LEARNED TO USE TOOLS AND METHODS TO FACILITATE BETTER SELF-DIRECTED PRACTICE. THE STUDY SHOWS MODERATE TO LARGE EFFECT SIZES.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
2 1262  48 FIVE-WEEK YIN YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS DECREASED PLASMA ADRENOMEDULLIN AND INCREASED PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH IN STRESSED ADULTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES (NCDS, E.G. CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE) ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR HIGH RATES OF MORBIDITY AND THE MAJORITY OF PREMATURE DEATHS WORLDWIDE. IT IS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP PREVENTATIVE INTERVENTIONS THAT CAN REDUCE THE ASSOCIATED RISK FACTORS OF NCDS. RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT THE BIOMARKER ADRENOMEDULLIN (ADM) BECOMES ELEVATED YEARS BEFORE THE ONSET OF NCDS AND MIGHT PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT. ADM HAS ALSO BEEN LINKED TO PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS SUCH AS STRESS, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION, WHICH ARE KNOWN RISK FACTORS OF NCDS. IN THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, WE EXAMINED WHETHER PARTICIPATING IN A FIVE-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION REDUCES ADM AND INCREASES PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH IN MIDDLE-AGED ADULTS WHO SELF-REPORT AS MODERATELY TO HIGHLY STRESSED, BUT WHO OTHERWISE EXHIBIT NO PHYSICAL COMPLAINTS. METHODS: ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE ADULTS (78% WOMEN; MEAN AGE = 53.5, SD = 6.7) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO (1) A FIVE-WEEK YIN YOGA INTERVENTION, (2) A FIVE-WEEK INTERVENTION COMBINING YIN YOGA WITH PSYCHOEDUCATION AND MINDFULNESS PRACTICE (CALLED THE YOMI PROGRAM), OR (3) A CONTROL GROUP WHO DID NOT PRACTICE YOGA OR MINDFULNESS FOR FIVE WEEKS. RESULTS: COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP, WE OBSERVED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER PRE-POST REDUCTIONS IN PLASMA ADM LEVELS (P < .001), ANXIETY (P </= .002), AND SLEEP PROBLEMS (P </= .003) IN BOTH INTERVENTION GROUPS. FURTHERMORE, THE YOMI GROUP EXCLUSIVELY SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER PRE-POST REDUCTIONS IN STRESS (P = .012) AND DEPRESSION (P = .021) COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS (P < .05) WERE FOUND BETWEEN PRE-POST REDUCTIONS IN ADM AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS (P = .02) AND DEPRESSION (P = .04) IN THE ENTIRE SAMPLE. CONCLUSION: THE FIVE-WEEK YIN YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS APPEARED TO REDUCE BOTH THE PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL RISK FACTORS KNOWN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH NCDS. THE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT INCORPORATING YIN YOGA COULD BE AN EASY AND LOW-COST METHOD OF LIMITING THE NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH STRESS.

3 1371  42 IMPACT OF A YIN YOGA AND MEDITATION INTERVENTION ON PHARMACY FACULTY AND STUDENT WELL-BEING. BACKGROUND: STUDENT PHARMACISTS AND FACULTY EXHIBIT HIGH LEVELS OF STRESS, INDEPENDENT OF THE CURRENT CORONAVIRUS 2019 PANDEMIC, AND THEIR PATH TOWARD WELLNESS, INCLUDING A REDUCTION IN STRESS AND ANXIETY, IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE. YOGA AND MEDITATION ARE PROVEN INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE STRESS AND ANXIETY AND INCREASE WELLNESS. YIN YOGA IS AN ADAPTABLE, QUIET PRACTICE IDEAL FOR THOSE LACKING PREVIOUS YOGA EXPERIENCE, FLEXIBILITY, AND TIME. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF A 6-WEEK YIN YOGA AND MEDITATION INTERVENTION ON COLLEGE OF PHARMACY FACULTY AND STUDENTS' STRESS PERCEPTION, ANXIETY LEVELS, AND MINDFULNESS SKILLS. METHODS: FACULTY AND STUDENTS PARTICIPATED IN A 6-WEEK PILOT PROGRAM COMPRISING A ONCE-WEEKLY YIN YOGA CLASS FOLLOWED BY GUIDED MEDITATION. YIN YOGA WAS SELECTED FOR ITS QUIET MEDITATIVE STYLE. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED A PRE- AND POSTQUESTIONNAIRE AT 6 WEEKS AND 3 AND 6 MONTHS TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN PERCEIVED STRESS SCORES, ANXIETY SCORES, AND MINDFULNESS SKILLS. THE QUESTIONNAIRE WAS COMPOSED OF 3 SELF-REPORTING TOOLS: BECK ANXIETY INVENTORY (BAI), PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE, AND THE FIVE FACET MINDFULNESS QUESTIONNAIRE. RESULTS: TWENTY PARTICIPANTS, 12 STUDENTS AND 8 FACULTY (AGES 18-66 YEARS), COMPLETED THE STUDY. ANXIETY AND STRESS SCORES DECREASED, AND MINDFULNESS INCREASED AT 6 WEEKS, 3 MONTHS AND 6 MONTHS, WITH ALL CHANGES REACHING STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. NO PARTICIPANTS REPORTED BEING IN THE "HIGH" CATEGORY OF ANXIETY AFTER INTERVENTION USING BAI CATEGORICAL DATA, ALTHOUGH THIS FINDING WAS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. CONCLUSION: FACULTY AND STUDENTS DEMONSTRATED A REDUCTION IN STRESS AND ANXIETY LEVELS AND AN INCREASE IN MINDFULNESS AFTER A 6-WEEK YIN YOGA AND MEDITATION PROGRAM. OUTCOMES SUGGEST THAT INCLUSION OF AN ADAPTABLE, MEDITATIVE PRACTICE, WHICH MAY EASILY BE REPLICATED AT HOME, FOR AS LITTLE AS ONCE PER WEEK FOR 6 WEEKS MAY REDUCE STRESS AND ANXIETY AND INCREASE MINDFULNESS LONG TERM. CREATING A CULTURE OF WELLNESS SHOULD BE A PRIORITY FOR ALL COLLEGES OF PHARMACY.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
4 1505  37 IREST YOGA-NIDRA ON THE COLLEGE CAMPUS: CHANGES IN STRESS, DEPRESSION, WORRY, AND MINDFULNESS. OBJECTIVES: THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT YOGA PRACTICE IS ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED STRESS, WORRY, AND DEPRESSION, AND WITH IMPROVED MINDFULNESS-BASED SKILLS. THESE FINDINGS HAD NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY REPLICATED FOR A SAMPLE OF COLLEGE STUDENTS. THIS STUDY EVALUATED WHETHER IREST YOGA-NIDRA PRACTICE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED PERCEIVED STRESS, WORRY, AND DEPRESSION, AND INCREASED MINDFULNESS IN A SAMPLE OF COLLEGE STUDENT S. METHODS: SIXTY-SIX STUDENTS AGE 18-56 COMPLETED AN 8-WEEK IREST YOGA-NIDRA INTERVENTION THAT WAS OFFERED FOR 8 SEMESTERS. ASSESSMENT OCCURRED 1 WEEK PRIOR TO INTERVENTION ONSET AND DURING THE CLASS PERIOD FOLLOWING THE INTERVENTION. QUALITATIVE DATA WERE COLLECTED AT WEEKS 4 AND 8. RESULTS: STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT PRE- TO POSTTEST IMPROVEMENTS IN PERCEIVED STRESS, WORRY, AND DEPRESSION WERE FOUND. PRE-EXISTING DEPRESSION ACCOUNTED FOR MOST OF THE CHANGE IN WORRY AND PERCEIVED STRESS SCORES. PRE- TO POST TEST IMPROVEMENTS IN MINDFULNESS-BASED SKILLS WERE ALSO DETECTED. CONCLUSIONS: IREST YOGA-NIDRA PRACTICE MAY REDUCE SYMPTOMS OF PERCEIVED STRESS, WORRY, AND DEPRESSION AND INCREASE MINDFULNESS-BASED SKILLS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
5 1597  31 MEDITATION WITH YOGA, GROUP THERAPY WITH HYPNOSIS, AND PSYCHOEDUCATION FOR LONG-TERM DEPRESSED MOOD: A RANDOMIZED PILOT TRIAL. THIS RANDOMIZED PILOT STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF MEDITATION WITH YOGA (AND PSYCHOEDUCATION) VERSUS GROUP THERAPY WITH HYPNOSIS (AND PSYCHOEDUCATION) VERSUS PSYCHOEDUCATION ALONE ON DIAGNOSTIC STATUS AND SYMPTOM LEVELS AMONG 46 INDIVIDUALS WITH LONG-TERM DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS. RESULTS INDICATE THAT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE MEDITATION GROUP PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCED A REMISSION THAN DID CONTROLS AT 9-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. EIGHT HYPNOSIS GROUP PARTICIPANTS ALSO EXPERIENCED A REMISSION, BUT THE DIFFERENCE FROM CONTROLS WAS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. THREE CONTROL PARTICIPANTS, BUT NO MEDITATION OR HYPNOSIS PARTICIPANTS, DEVELOPED A NEW DEPRESSIVE EPISODE DURING THE STUDY, THOUGH THIS DIFFERENCE DID NOT REACH STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE IN ANY CASE. ALTHOUGH ALL GROUPS REPORTED SOME REDUCTION IN SYMPTOM LEVELS, THEY DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY IN THAT OUTCOME. OVERALL, THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THESE TWO INTERVENTIONS SHOW PROMISE FOR TREATING LOW- TO MODERATE-LEVEL DEPRESSION.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
6  524  43 COMPARISON OF COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY AND YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF LATE-LIFE WORRY: A RANDOMIZED PREFERENCE TRIAL. BACKGROUND: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT) AND YOGA ON LATE-LIFE WORRY, ANXIETY, AND SLEEP; AND EXAMINE PREFERENCE AND SELECTION EFFECTS ON THESE OUTCOMES. METHODS: A RANDOMIZED PREFERENCE TRIAL OF CBT AND YOGA WAS CONDUCTED IN COMMUNITY-DWELLING ADULTS 60 YEARS OR OLDER, WHO SCORED 26 OR ABOVE ON THE PENN STATE WORRY QUESTIONNAIRE-ABBREVIATED (PSWQ-A). CBT CONSISTED OF 10 WEEKLY TELEPHONE SESSIONS. YOGA CONSISTED OF 20 BIWEEKLY GROUP YOGA CLASSES. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS WORRY (PSWQ-A); THE SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE ANXIETY (PROMIS-ANXIETY) AND SLEEP (INSOMNIA SEVERITY INDEX [ISI]). WE EXAMINED BOTH PREFERENCE EFFECTS (AVERAGE EFFECT FOR THOSE WHO RECEIVED THEIR PREFERRED INTERVENTION [REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT WAS CBT OR YOGA] MINUS THE AVERAGE FOR THOSE WHO DID NOT RECEIVE THEIR PREFERRED INTERVENTION [REGARDLESS OF THE INTERVENTION]) AND SELECTION EFFECT (WHICH ADDRESSES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THERE IS A BENEFIT TO GETTING TO SELECT ONE INTERVENTION OVER THE OTHER, AND MEASURES THE EFFECT ON OUTCOMES OF SELF-SELECTION TO A SPECIFIC INTERVENTION). RESULTS: FIVE HUNDRED OLDER ADULTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO THE RANDOMIZED TRIAL (125 EACH IN CBT AND YOGA) OR THE PREFERENCE TRIAL (120 CHOSE CBT; 130 CHOSE YOGA). IN THE RANDOMIZED TRIAL, THE INTERVENTION EFFECT OF YOGA COMPARED WITH CBT ADJUSTED FOR BASELINE PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION USE, GENDER, AND RACE WAS 1.6 (-0.2, 3.3), P = .08 FOR THE PSWQ-A. SIMILAR RESULTS WERE OBSERVED WITH PROMIS-ANXIETY (ADJUSTED INTERVENTION EFFECT: 0.3 [-1.5, 2.2], P = .71). PARTICIPANTS RANDOMIZED TO CBT EXPERIENCED A GREATER REDUCTION IN THE ISI COMPARED WITH YOGA (ADJUSTED INTERVENTION EFFECT: 2.4 [1.2, 3.7], P < .01]). ESTIMATED IN THE COMBINED DATA SET (N = 500), THE PREFERENCE AND SELECTION EFFECTS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR THE PSWQ-A, PROMIS-ANXIETY, AND ISI. OF THE 52 ADVERSE EVENTS, ONLY TWO WERE POSSIBLY RELATED TO THE INTERVENTION. NONE OF THE 26 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS WERE RELATED TO THE STUDY INTERVENTIONS. CONCLUSIONS: CBT AND YOGA WERE BOTH EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING LATE-LIFE WORRY AND ANXIETY. HOWEVER, A GREATER IMPACT WAS SEEN FOR CBT COMPARED WITH YOGA FOR IMPROVING SLEEP. NEITHER PREFERENCE NOR SELECTION EFFECTS WAS FOUND.	2020	
                                        
7   44  29 A CASE SERIES ON THE EFFECTS OF KRIPALU YOGA FOR GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER. GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER (GAD) IS A PREVALENT PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER ASSOCIATED WITH SUBSTANTIAL IMPAIRMENT AND POOR TREATMENT RESPONSE. YOGA INFLUENCES PROCESSES THAT ARE LINKED TO THE MAINTENANCE OF GAD INCLUDING MINDFULNESS, ANXIETY, AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY, BUT HAS YET TO BE EVALUATED AMONG PEOPLE WITH THE DISORDER. THE PRESENT STUDY IS A FIRST STEP TOWARD DOCUMENTING THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR REDUCING WORRY AMONG PEOPLE WITH GAD USING A SINGLE-SUBJECT AB DESIGN CASE SERIES AND DAILY RATINGS OF WORRY. STANDARDIZED SELF-REPORT MEASURES OF WORRY, TRAIT ANXIETY, EXPERIENTIAL AVOIDANCE, MINDFULNESS, AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY WERE ASSESSED PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION. THREE PARTICIPANTS WITH PRIMARY GAD RECEIVED EIGHT TWICE-WEEKLY KRIPALU YOGA SESSIONS FOLLOWING A BASELINE DATA COLLECTION PERIOD. ALL PARTICIPANTS SHOWED SYSTEMATIC IMPROVEMENT IN DAILY WORRY RATINGS ON AT LEAST ONE INDEX AND ALL SCORES ON SELF-REPORTED MEASURES OF WORRY, ANXIETY, EXPERIENTIAL AVOIDANCE, AND MINDFULNESS CHANGED IN THE EXPECTED DIRECTION FOLLOWING YOGA (WITH ONE OR TWO EXCEPTIONS). PARTICIPANTS ALSO SHOWED IMPROVED HEART RATE VARIABILITY DURING A WORRY PERIOD FROM PRE- TO POST-INTERVENTION. YOGA HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE PROCESSES LINKED TO GAD AND SHOULD STIMULATE FURTHER RESEARCH IN THIS AREA.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
8 1541  37 KRIPALU YOGA FOR MILITARY VETERANS WITH PTSD: A RANDOMIZED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA FOR MILITARY VETERANS AND ACTIVE DUTY PERSONNEL WITH POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) EVALUATED THE EFFICACY OF A 10-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION ON PTSD. METHOD: FIFTY-ONE PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO YOGA OR NO-TREATMENT ASSESSMENT-ONLY CONTROL GROUPS. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED QUESTIONNAIRES AND THE CLINICIAN ADMINISTERED PTSD SCALE. RESULTS: BOTH YOGA (N = 9) AND CONTROL (N = 6) PARTICIPANTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN REEXPERIENCING SYMPTOMS, WITH NO SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCES. SECONDARY WITHIN-GROUP ANALYSES OF A SELF-SELECTED WAIT-LIST YOGA GROUP (N = 7) SHOWED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN PTSD SYMPTOMS AFTER YOGA PARTICIPATION, IN CONTRAST TO THEIR CONTROL GROUP PARTICIPATION. CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT LITERATURE REGARDING HIGH RATES OF PTSD TREATMENT DROPOUT FOR VETERANS, THIS STUDY FACED CHALLENGES RETAINING PARTICIPANTS ACROSS CONDITIONS. CONCLUSION: THESE RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH RECENT LITERATURE INDICATING THAT YOGA MAY HAVE POTENTIAL AS A PTSD THERAPY IN A VETERAN OR MILITARY POPULATION. HOWEVER, ADDITIONAL LARGER SAMPLE SIZE TRIALS ARE NECESSARY TO CONFIRM THIS CONCLUSION.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
9  133  41 A PRAGMATIC PREFERENCE TRIAL OF THERAPEUTIC YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT TO GROUP COGNITIVE BEHAVIOUR THERAPY VERSUS GROUP CBT ALONE FOR DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY. BACKGROUND: YOGA HAS SEVERAL MECHANISMS THAT MAKE IT A PROMISING TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, INCLUDING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, BEHAVIOURAL ACTIVATION, AND MINDFULNESS. FOLLOWING POSITIVE OUTCOMES FROM ADAPTED CBT INTERVENTIONS INCORPORATING MINDFULNESS-BASED PRACTICES, THIS STUDY EXPLORED THE EFFECTS OF A THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM AS AN ADJUNCT TO GROUP-BASED CBT FOR DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY. METHODS: THIS WAS A PRAGMATIC PREFERENCE TRIAL INVOLVING ADULTS DIAGNOSED WITH DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY IN A REGIONAL PRIMARY MENTAL HEALTHCARE SERVICE (N = 59), COMPARING TRANSDIAGNOSTIC GROUP CBT (N = 27) WITH TRANSDIAGNOSTIC GROUP CBT COMBINED WITH AN ADJUNCT THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM (N = 32). A PREFERENCE RECRUITMENT DESIGN ALLOWED ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS (N = 35) TO SELF-SELECT INTO THE ADJUNCT PROGRAM. THE DEPRESSION ANXIETY STRESS SCALE-21 (DASS) WAS ASSESSED AT BASELINE, POST-INTERVENTION, AND THREE-MONTHS FOLLOW UP. RESULTS: CBT + YOGA WAS AN ACCEPTABLE ALTERNATIVE TO CBT ALONE. SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS WERE OBSERVED IN TOTAL DASS SCORES AND THE 3 SUBSCALES OF THE DASS FOR BOTH GROUPS, HOWEVER CBT + YOGA SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER DEPRESSIVE AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS POST-INTERVENTION, COMPARED TO CBT ALONE. CBT + YOGA ALSO SHOWED SUSTAINED REDUCTIONS IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS OVER THREE-MONTHS, AND MORE RAPID REDUCTIONS IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, COMPARED TO CBT ALONE. LIMITATIONS: THESE FINDINGS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED PRELIMINARY DUE TO THE MODERATE SAMPLE SIZE, WITH A RIGOROUS RANDOMISED CONTROL TRIAL NECESSARY TO DEFINITIVELY SUPPORT THE INTEGRATION OF YOGA WITHIN MENTAL HEALTH CARE TO AUGMENT THE BENEFITS AND UPTAKE OF TRANSDIAGNOSTIC CBT FOR DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY. CONCLUSIONS: COMPLEMENTING OTHER MINDFULNESS-BASED PRACTICES, THERAPEUTIC YOGA SHOWS PROMISE AS AN ADJUNCT TO TRANSDIAGNOSTIC CBT.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
10  345  35 ASSESSING FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF YOGA AND GROUP CBT FOR ADOLESCENTS WITH DEPRESSION: A PILOT RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. PURPOSE: GIVEN INCREASING RATES OF DEPRESSION IN ADOLESCENTS, THERE IS A CLEAR NEED FOR INNOVATIVE TREATMENTS. IN THIS PILOT RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL, WE ASSESSED ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF TWO GROUP-BASED INTERVENTIONS: YOGA AND COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT). THE GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO PREPARE FOR A FUTURE FULLY POWERED RANDOMIZED TRIAL TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT YOGA IS NOT INFERIOR TO AN ESTABLISHED ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION TREATMENT, NAMELY, GROUP CBT. METHODS: WE ENROLLED 42 ADOLESCENTS WITH ELEVATED DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A 12-WEEK GROUP-BASED INTERVENTION, YOGA OR CBT. WE HAD A PRIORI FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY TARGETS, INCLUDING FOR RECRUITMENT RATE, RETENTION RATE, EXPECTANCY, CREDIBILITY, PROGRAM SATISFACTION, CLASS ATTENDANCE, ENGAGEMENT IN HOME PRACTICE, AND INSTRUCTOR/LEADER MANUAL ADHERENCE. WE ASSESSED ADVERSE EVENTS, AND WITHIN-SUBJECT CHANGES IN OUTCOMES (DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, IMPAIRMENT, SLEEP DISTURBANCE) AND POSSIBLE MEDIATORS (MINDFULNESS, SELF-COMPASSION). RESULTS: BOTH INTERVENTIONS MET MOST ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY TARGETS. THE ONLY TARGET NOT MET RELATED TO LOW ENGAGEMENT IN HOME PRACTICE. PARTICIPANTS WITHIN EACH STUDY ARM SHOWED DECREASED DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS OVER TIME AND INCREASED SELF-COMPASSION. CONCLUSIONS: A YOGA INTERVENTION APPEARS TO BE ACCEPTABLE AND FEASIBLE TO ADOLESCENTS WITH DEPRESSION. HOWEVER, IT MAY BE CHALLENGING FOR THIS GROUP TO ENGAGE IN UNSTRUCTURED HOME PRACTICE.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
11 1827  35 PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR FEMALE INMATES. FEMALE INMATES INVOLVED IN THE YOGA PRISON PROJECT AT TWO CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES IN SOUTH CAROLINA SERVED AS SUBJECTS. INMATES WERE SELECTED FROM THOSE WHO APPLIED TO PARTICIPATE IN A TEN-WEEK TRAUMA-FOCUSED YOGA PROGRAM. TO CREATE CONTROL AND EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS, INMATES WHO REQUESTED TO PARTICIPATE WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO BE IN THE CLASS (TREATMENT GROUP, N = 33) OR A WAITLIST (CONTROL GROUP, N = 17). INMATES ON THE WAITLIST SUBSEQUENTLY JOINED THE NEXT CLASS, SO ALL WHO APPLIED AND WERE ELIGIBLE PARTICIPATED IN A YOGA CLASS. MEASURES OF STRESS, DEPRESSION, SELF CONTROL, ANXIETY, SELF AWARENESS AND RUMINATION WERE USED AND DATA WAS COLLECTED FROM BOTH GROUPS BEFORE THE INITIAL YOGA CLASS BEGAN AND AGAIN AT THE END, TEN WEEKS LATER. TO ASSESS THE CHANGES FROM PRE-INTERVENTION TO POST-INTERVENTION, MIXED DESIGN ANOVA TESTS WERE CONDUCTED. INMATES IN THE YOGA GROUP REPORTED SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN DEPRESSION AND STRESS AND IMPROVED SELF-AWARENESS. NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE FOUND ON MEASURES OF ANXIETY, RUMINATION AND SELF-CONTROL IN THE YOGA GROUPS. ALTHOUGH NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT, ANXIETY SCORES DID DECREASE AND SELF-CONTROL SCORES IMPROVED FOR THE YOGA GROUP, WHILE INMATES IN THE CONTROL GROUP REPORTED A WORSENING OR NO CHANGE ON THESE TWO MEASURES. NO CHANGES WERE FOUND IN RUMINATION LEVELS. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA IS A RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE INTERVENTION THAT COULD BENEFIT BOTH INMATES AND PRISON STAFF BY REDUCING SOME NEGATIVE BEHAVIORS AND POSSIBLY MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
12  390  49 BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL-BEING IN A US HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM: A PRELIMINARY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: TO TEST FEASIBILITY OF YOGA WITHIN A HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM AND EVALUATE PREVENTIVE EFFICACY FOR PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL-BEING. METHODS: GRADE 11 OR 12 STUDENTS (N = 51) WHO REGISTERED FOR PHYSICAL EDUCATION (PE) WERE CLUSTER-RANDOMIZED BY CLASS 2:1 YOGA:PE-AS-USUAL. A KRIPALU-BASED YOGA PROGRAM OF PHYSICAL POSTURES, BREATHING EXERCISES, RELAXATION, AND MEDITATION WAS TAUGHT 2 TO 3 TIMES A WEEK FOR 10 WEEKS. SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES WERE ADMINISTERED TO STUDENTS 1 WEEK BEFORE AND AFTER. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES OF PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL-BEING WERE PROFILE OF MOOD STATES-SHORT FORM AND POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECT SCHEDULE FOR CHILDREN. ADDITIONAL MEASURES OF PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL-BEING INCLUDED PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE AND INVENTORY OF POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL ATTITUDES. SECONDARY MEASURES OF SELF-REGULATORY SKILLS INCLUDED RESILIENCE SCALE, STATE TRAIT ANGER EXPRESSION INVENTORY-2, AND CHILD ACCEPTANCE MINDFULNESS MEASURE. TO ASSESS FEASIBILITY, YOGA STUDENTS COMPLETED A PROGRAM EVALUATION. ANALYSES OF COVARIANCE WERE CONDUCTED BETWEEN GROUPS WITH BASELINE AS THE COVARIATE. RESULTS: ALTHOUGH PE-AS-USUAL STUDENTS SHOWED DECREASES IN PRIMARY OUTCOMES, YOGA STUDENTS MAINTAINED OR IMPROVED. TOTAL MOOD DISTURBANCE IMPROVED IN YOGA STUDENTS AND WORSENED IN CONTROLS (P = .015), AS DID PROFILE OF MOOD STATES-SHORT FORM (POMS-SF) TENSION-ANXIETY SUBSCALE (P = .002). ALTHOUGH POSITIVE AFFECT REMAINED UNCHANGED IN BOTH, NEGATIVE AFFECT SIGNIFICANTLY WORSENED IN CONTROLS WHILE IMPROVING IN YOGA STUDENTS (P = .006). SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT. STUDENTS RATED YOGA FAIRLY HIGH, DESPITE MODERATE ATTENDANCE. CONCLUSIONS: IMPLEMENTATION WAS FEASIBLE AND STUDENTS GENERALLY FOUND IT BENEFICIAL. ALTHOUGH NOT CAUSAL DUE TO SMALL, UNEVEN SAMPLE SIZE, THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY SUGGESTS PREVENTIVE BENEFITS IN PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL-BEING FROM KRIPALU YOGA DURING HIGH SCHOOL PE. THESE RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED STUDIES OF YOGA IN SCHOOL SETTINGS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
13  110  26 A PILOT STUDY MEASURING THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON THE TRAIT OF MINDFULNESS. BACKGROUND: THE CURRENT STUDY EXAMINED WHETHER YOGA WOULD INCREASE LEVELS OF MINDFULNESS IN A HEALTHY POPULATION. METHOD: FORTY-SIX PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP OR A WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP. MINDFULNESS WAS ASSESSED PRE AND POST YOGA, USING THE FREIBURG MINDFULNESS INVENTORY (FMI). RESULTS: RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE YOGA GROUP EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OVERALL MINDFULNESS, AND IN THREE MINDFULNESS SUBSCALES; ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT MOMENT, ACCEPTING AND OPEN ATTITUDES TOWARD EXPERIENCE, AND INSIGHTFUL UNDERSTANDING (P < .01). THE CONTROL GROUP EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OVERALL MINDFULNESS (P < .02) AND INSIGHTFUL UNDERSTANDING (P < .01). FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT A YOGA INTERVENTION MAY BE A VIABLE METHOD FOR INCREASING LEVELS OF TRAIT MINDFULNESS IN A HEALTHY POPULATION, POTENTIALLY IMPLICATING YOGA AS A PREVENTIVE METHOD FOR THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF NEGATIVE EMOTIONAL MOOD STATES (I.E. ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION). THE CONTROL GROUP ALSO EXPERIENCED MODERATE ELEVATIONS OF MINDFULNESS AT THE SECOND ASSESSMENT.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
14 1557  39 LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY AND YOGA FOR WORRIED OLDER ADULTS. OBJECTIVES: COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT) AND YOGA DECREASE WORRY AND ANXIETY. THERE ARE NO LONG-TERM DATA COMPARING CBT AND YOGA FOR WORRY, ANXIETY, AND SLEEP IN OLDER ADULTS. THE IMPACT OF PREFERENCE AND SELECTION ON THESE OUTCOMES IS UNKNOWN. IN THIS SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS, WE COMPARED LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF CBT BY TELEPHONE AND YOGA ON WORRY, ANXIETY, SLEEP, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, FATIGUE, PHYSICAL FUNCTION, SOCIAL PARTICIPATION, AND PAIN; AND EXAMINED PREFERENCE AND SELECTION EFFECTS. DESIGN: IN THIS RANDOMIZED PREFERENCE TRIAL, PARTICIPANTS (N = 500) WERE RANDOMIZED TO A: 1) RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) OF CBT OR YOGA (N = 250); OR 2) PREFERENCE TRIAL (SELECTED CBT OR YOGA; N = 250). OUTCOMES WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE AND WEEK 37. SETTING: COMMUNITY. PARTICIPANTS: COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS (AGE 60+ YEARS). INTERVENTIONS: CBT (BY TELEPHONE) AND YOGA (IN-PERSON GROUP CLASSES). MEASUREMENTS: PENN STATE WORRY QUESTIONNAIRE - ABBREVIATED (WORRY);(1)(,)(2) INSOMNIA SEVERITY INDEX (SLEEP);(3) PROMIS ANXIETY SHORT FORM V1.0 (ANXIETY);(4)(,)(5) GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER SCREENER (GENERALIZED ANXIETY);(6)(,)(7) AND PROMIS-29 (DEPRESSION, FATIGUE, PHYSICAL FUNCTION, SOCIAL PARTICIPATION, PAIN).(8)(,)(9) RESULTS: SIX MONTHS AFTER INTERVENTION COMPLETION, CBT AND YOGA RCT PARTICIPANTS REPORTED SUSTAINED IMPROVEMENTS FROM BASELINE IN WORRY, ANXIETY, SLEEP, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, FATIGUE, AND SOCIAL PARTICIPATION (NO SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCES). USING DATA COMBINED FROM THE RANDOMIZED AND PREFERENCE TRIALS, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT PREFERENCE OR SELECTION EFFECTS. LONG-TERM INTERVENTION EFFECTS WERE OBSERVED AT CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL LEVELS FOR MOST OF THE STUDY OUTCOMES. CONCLUSIONS: CBT AND YOGA BOTH DEMONSTRATED MAINTAINED IMPROVEMENTS FROM BASELINE ON MULTIPLE OUTCOMES SIX MONTHS AFTER INTERVENTION COMPLETION IN A LARGE SAMPLE OF OLDER ADULTS.

15  201  39 A RESTORATIVE YOGA INTERVENTION FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: DATA SHOW THAT YOGA IS EFFECTIVE FOR IMPROVING HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOMES IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. WHILE BREAST CANCER IS THE MOST COMMONLY DIAGNOSED CANCER AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN (AAW), AAW ARE LESS LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN YOGA COMPARED TO OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS. THE GOALS OF THE CURRENT STUDY WERE TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF AN 8-WEEK RESTORATIVE YOGA PROGRAM AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICAN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS (AA BCS). SPECIFICALLY, STUDY AIMS WERE TO (1) MEASURE CHANGES IN STUDY OUTCOMES IN A RESTORATIVE YOGA (RY) GROUP COMPARED TO A WAIT LIST CONTROL GROUP, (2) ASSESS ADHERENCE TO THE RY PROGRAM, AND (3) ASSESS PROGRAM SATISFACTION AMONG STUDY PARTICIPANTS. METHODS: THIRTY-THREE AA BCS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER THE RY INTERVENTION (N = 18) OR WAIT LIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 15). RY CLASSES MET ONCE PER WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS. PRE- AND POST-TESTING ASSESSMENTS WERE MEASURED AT 0 AND 8 WEEKS (IMMEDIATELY POST-INTERVENTION). RESULTS: DEPRESSION SCORES AT FOLLOW-UP WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN THE YOGA GROUP (M = 4.78, SD = 3.56) COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP (M = 6.91, SD = 5.86). NO SIGNIFICANT GROUP DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED FOR SLEEP QUALITY, FATIGUE, OR PERCEIVED STRESS. YOGA PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS COMPLETING BASELINE ASSESSMENTS DEMONSTRATED 61% ADHERENCE TO THE YOGA CLASSES. AVERAGE RATING OF THE YOGA PROGRAM WAS "VERY USEFUL." RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE YOGA PROGRAMS WERE PROVIDED. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT YOGA HAS A BENEFICIAL EFFECT ON DEPRESSION IN AA BCS. THERE IS, HOWEVER, A NEED TO FURTHER EXPLORE THE BENEFITS OF YOGA AMONG MINORITY BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS USING A STUDY WITH LARGER SAMPLE SIZES.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
16 1861  32 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF BIKRAM YOGA AND AEROBIC EXERCISE FOR DEPRESSION IN WOMEN: EFFICACY AND STRESS-BASED MECHANISMS. BACKGROUND: THE CURRENT STUDY PRESENTS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED 8-WEEK TRIAL OF BIKRAM YOGA, AEROBIC EXERCISE, AND WAITLIST FOR DEPRESSION. BIKRAM YOGA WAS CHOSEN SPECIFICALLY FOR ITS STANDARDIZED NATURE. FURTHER, WE EXAMINED CHANGES IN THREE STRESS-RELATED CONSTRUCTS-PERCEIVED STRESS, RUMINATION, AND MINDFULNESS-AS MEDIATORS OF ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFECTS. METHOD: FIFTY-THREE WOMEN (AGE 18-65; 74% WHITE) WITH A UNIPOLAR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THE THREE CONDITIONS. RESPONSE WAS DEFINED AS >50% REDUCTION ON THE HAMILTON RATING SCALE FOR DEPRESSION (HAM-D). REMISSION WAS DEFINED AS NO LONGER MEETING CRITERIA FOR DEPRESSION AND A HAM-D </= 7. SELF-REPORTED PERCEIVED STRESS, RUMINATION, AND MINDFULNESS WERE ASSESSED WEEKLY. RESULTS: IN THE INTENTION-TO-TREAT SAMPLE (N = 53), RESPONSE RATES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN THE BIKRAM YOGA (61.1%; CHI(2) = 10.48, P = .001) AND AEROBIC EXERCISE (60.0%; CHI(2) = 10.44, P = .001) CONDITIONS RELATIVE TO WAITLIST (6.7%). IN THE COMPLETER SAMPLE (N = 42), 73.3% (CHI(2) = 11.41, P = .001) OF WOMEN IN YOGA AND 80.0% (CHI(2) = 13.72, P < .001) IN EXERCISE ACHIEVED RESPONSE COMPARED TO 8.3% IN WAITLIST. REDUCTIONS IN RUMINATION SIGNIFICANTLY MEDIATED HAM-D CHANGE FOR BOTH ACTIVE TREATMENTS, AND MINDFUL ACCEPTANCE WAS A PARTIAL MEDIATOR IN THE EXERCISE CONDITION. LIMITATIONS: THE SAMPLE WAS SMALL IN SIZE, CONSISTED OF WOMEN ONLY, AND WAS ETHNICALLY HOMOGENOUS. INTER-RATER RELIABILITY WAS NOT ASSESSED, AEROBIC EXERCISE WAS NOT STANDARDIZED, AND MEDIATORS WERE ASSESSED BY SELF-REPORT. CONCLUSIONS: BIKRAM YOGA SHOWED DESCRIPTIVELY SIMILAR EFFICACY TO AEROBIC EXERCISE AND BOTH MAY WORK, IN PART, BY HELPING INDIVIDUALS INTERRUPT NEGATIVE THINKING.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
17  187  42 A RANDOMIZED PREFERENCE TRIAL COMPARING COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY AND YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF LATE-LIFE WORRY: EXAMINATION OF IMPACT ON DEPRESSION, GENERALIZED ANXIETY, FATIGUE, PAIN, SOCIAL PARTICIPATION, AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION. BACKGROUND: DEPRESSION, GENERALIZED ANXIETY, FATIGUE, DIMINISHED PHYSICAL FUNCTION, REDUCED SOCIAL PARTICIPATION, AND PAIN ARE COMMON FOR MANY OLDER ADULTS AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT QUALITY OF LIFE. THE PURPOSE OF THE OVERALL TRIAL WAS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT) AND YOGA ON LATE-LIFE WORRY, ANXIETY, AND SLEEP; AND EXAMINE PREFERENCE AND SELECTION EFFECTS ON THESE OUTCOMES. OBJECTIVE: THE PRESENT ANALYSES COMPARED EFFECTS OF THE 2 INTERVENTIONS ON ADDITIONAL OUTCOMES (DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, GENERALIZED ANXIETY SYMPTOMS, FATIGUE, PAIN INTERFERENCE/INTENSITY, PHYSICAL FUNCTION, SOCIAL PARTICIPATION); AND EXAMINED WHETHER THERE ARE PREFERENCE AND SELECTION EFFECTS FOR THESE TREATMENTS. METHODS: A RANDOMIZED PREFERENCE TRIAL OF CBT AND YOGA WAS CONDUCTED IN ADULTS >/=60 YEARS WHO SCORED >/=26 ON THE PENN STATE WORRY QUESTIONNAIRE-ABBREVIATED (PSWQ-A), RECRUITED FROM OUTPATIENT MEDICAL CLINICS, MAILINGS, AND ADVERTISEMENTS. COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY CONSISTED OF 10 WEEKLY TELEPHONE SESSIONS. YOGA CONSISTED OF 20 BI-WEEKLY GROUP YOGA CLASSES. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO(1): A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) OF CBT OR YOGA (N = 250); OR (2) A PREFERENCE TRIAL IN WHICH THEY SELECTED THEIR TREATMENT (CBT OR YOGA; N = 250). OUTCOMES WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION. RESULTS: WITHIN THE RCT, THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCES FOR BOTH PAIN INTERFERENCE AND INTENSITY. THE PAIN INTERFERENCE SCORE IMPROVED MORE FOR THE CBT GROUP COMPARED WITH THE YOGA GROUP [INTERVENTION EFFECT OF (MEAN (95% CI) = 2.5 (.5, 4.6), P = .02]. FOR THE PAIN INTENSITY SCORE, THE INTERVENTION EFFECT ALSO FAVORED CBT OVER YOGA [.7 (.2, 1.3), P < .01]. DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, GENERALIZED ANXIETY, AND FATIGUE SHOWED CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL WITHIN-GROUP CHANGES IN BOTH GROUPS. THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN OR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PHYSICAL FUNCTION OR SOCIAL PARTICIPATION FOR EITHER GROUP. NO PREFERENCE OR SELECTION EFFECTS WERE FOUND. CONCLUSION: BOTH CBT AND YOGA MAY BE USEFUL FOR OLDER ADULTS FOR IMPROVING PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS AND FATIGUE. COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY MAY OFFER EVEN GREATER BENEFIT THAN YOGA FOR DECREASING PAIN.	2022	

18 2442  36 YOGA AND SELF-REPORTED COGNITIVE PROBLEMS IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: CANCER SURVIVORS OFTEN REPORT COGNITIVE PROBLEMS. FURTHERMORE, DECREASES IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TYPICALLY OCCUR OVER THE COURSE OF CANCER TREATMENT. ALTHOUGH PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BENEFITS COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN NONCANCER POPULATIONS, EVIDENCE LINKING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN CANCER SURVIVORS IS LIMITED. IN OUR RECENT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WHO RECEIVED A YOGA INTERVENTION HAD LOWER FATIGUE AND INFLAMMATION FOLLOWING THE TRIAL COMPARED WITH A WAIT LIST CONTROL GROUP. THIS SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF THE PARENT TRIAL ADDRESSED YOGA'S IMPACT ON COGNITIVE COMPLAINTS. METHODS: POSTTREATMENT STAGE 0-IIIA BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS (N = 200) WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 12-WEEK, TWICE-WEEKLY HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION OR A WAIT LIST CONTROL GROUP. PARTICIPANTS REPORTED COGNITIVE COMPLAINTS USING THE BREAST CANCER PREVENTION TRIAL COGNITIVE PROBLEMS SCALE AT BASELINE, IMMEDIATELY POSTINTERVENTION, AND 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: COGNITIVE COMPLAINTS DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN GROUPS IMMEDIATELY POSTINTERVENTION (P = 0.250). HOWEVER, AT 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP, YOGA PARTICIPANTS' BREAST CANCER PREVENTION TRIAL COGNITIVE PROBLEMS SCALE SCORES WERE AN AVERAGE OF 23% LOWER THAN WAIT LIST PARTICIPANTS' SCORES (P = 0.003). THESE GROUP DIFFERENCES IN COGNITIVE COMPLAINTS REMAINED AFTER CONTROLLING FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, FATIGUE, AND SLEEP QUALITY. CONSISTENT WITH THE PRIMARY RESULTS, THOSE WHO PRACTICED YOGA MORE FREQUENTLY REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER COGNITIVE PROBLEMS AT 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP THAN THOSE WHO PRACTICED LESS FREQUENTLY (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA CAN EFFECTIVELY REDUCE BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS' COGNITIVE COMPLAINTS AND PROMPT FURTHER RESEARCH ON MIND-BODY AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY INTERVENTIONS FOR IMPROVING CANCER-RELATED COGNITIVE PROBLEMS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
19 1130  30 EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR DEPRESSED POSTPARTUM WOMEN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: UP TO 20% OF WOMEN EXPERIENCE POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION (PPD). PPD IS ASSOCIATED WITH ANXIETY AND POOR HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL). EFFICACIOUS TREATMENTS ARE CRITICAL; MANY WOMEN WITH PPD PREFER COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES. THUS, THE CURRENT STUDY EXAMINED YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR PPD. METHODS: FIFTY-SEVEN POSTPARTUM WOMEN WITH SCORES >/=12 ON THE HAMILTON DEPRESSION RATING SCALE WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A YOGA (N = 28) OR WAIT-LIST CONTROL (N = 29) GROUP. THE YOGA INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF 16 CLASSES OVER 8 WEEKS. OUTCOMES WERE DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND HRQOL. RESULTS: THE YOGA GROUP EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER RATE OF IMPROVEMENT IN DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND HRQOL, RELATIVE TO THE CONTROL GROUP WITH MODERATE TO LARGE EFFECTS. RELIABLE CHANGE INDEX ANALYSES REVEALED THAT 78% OF WOMEN IN THE YOGA GROUP EXPERIENCED CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. CONCLUSION: THESE FINDINGS SUPPORT YOGA AS A PROMISING COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR PPD, AND WARRANT LARGE-SCALE REPLICATION STUDIES.

AT THE END OF THE 4-WEEK RCT, THE CONTROL GROUP WAS INSTRUCTED TO LEARN AND PRACTICE THE MODULES FOR THE REMAINING 8 WEEKS. PRIMARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED STRESS AND WELL-BEING. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, RESILIENCE, POSITIVE AFFECT AND NEGATIVE AFFECT. LINEAR MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS WERE USED FOR ANALYSES. ISHA UPA YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED STRESS (GROUP [INTERVENTION, CONTROL] X TIME [BASELINE, WEEK 4] INTERACTION, P = .009, D = .27) AND INCREASED WELL-BEING (GROUP X TIME INTERACTION P = .002, D = .32). BY THE STUDY'S END, THE INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN WELL-BEING (P < .001, P < .001), STRESS (P < .001, P < .001), ANXIETY (P < .001, P < .001), DEPRESSION (P < .001, P = .004), POSITIVE AFFECT (P = .04, P < .001), AND NEGATIVE AFFECT (P < .001, P < .001). ONLINE ISHA UPA YOGA SHOWS PROMISE FOR MITIGATING THE PANDEMIC'S NEGATIVE IMPACT ON UNDERGRADUATES' MENTAL HEALTH AND IMPROVING THEIR WELL-BEING.	2022

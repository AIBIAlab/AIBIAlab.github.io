1 1748 152 PILOT RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL OF A DYADIC YOGA PROGRAM FOR GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS. BACKGROUND: WHILE THE USE OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE IN MANAGING GLIOMA PATIENTS' SYMPTOMS IS NOT WELL STUDIED, THE HIGH SYMPTOM BURDEN IN PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS IS WELL ESTABLISHED. WE CONDUCTED A PILOT RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF A DYADIC YOGA (DY) INTERVENTION AS A SUPPORTIVE CARE STRATEGY. METHODS: GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 12-SESSION DY OR WAITLIST CONTROL (WLC) GROUP. PRIOR TO RADIOTHERAPY AND RANDOMIZATION, BOTH GROUPS COMPLETED MEASURES OF CANCER-RELATED SYMPTOMS (MD ANDERSON SYMPTOM INVENTORY-BRAIN TUMOR MODULE), DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (CENTER FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES-DEPRESSION MEASURE), FATIGUE (BRIEF FATIGUE INVENTORY), AND OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL; MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY 36-ITEM SHORT-FORM SURVEY). DYADS WERE REASSESSED AT THE LAST DAY OF RADIOTHERAPY. RESULTS: TWENTY PATIENTS (MEAN AGE: 46 YEARS, 50% FEMALE, 80% WHO GRADE IV AND CAREGIVERS (MEAN AGE: 50 YEARS, 70% FEMALE, 50% SPOUSES) PARTICIPATED IN THE TRIAL. A PRIORI FEASIBILITY CRITERIA WERE MET REGARDING CONSENT (70%), ADHERENCE (88%), AND RETENTION (95%) RATES. CONTROLLING FOR RELEVANT COVARIATES, CHANGE SCORE ANALYSES REVEALED CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS FOR PATIENTS IN THE DY COMPARED WITH THE WLC GROUP FOR OVERALL CANCER SYMPTOM SEVERITY (D = 0.96) AND SYMPTOM INTERFERENCE (D = 0.74), DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (D = 0.71), AND MENTAL QOL (D = 0.69). CAREGIVERS IN THE DY GROUP REPORTED CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (D = 1.12), FATIGUE (D = 0.89), AND MENTAL QOL (D = 0.49) RELATIVE TO THOSE IN THE WLC GROUP. CONCLUSION: A DY INTERVENTION APPEARS TO BE A FEASIBLE AND BENEFICIAL SYMPTOM AND QOL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. AN EFFICACY TRIAL WITH A MORE STRINGENT CONTROL GROUP IS WARRANTED. CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: NCT02481349.	2019	
                                     
2  962  36 EFFECTS OF A YOGA PROGRAM ON CORTISOL RHYTHM AND MOOD STATES IN EARLY BREAST CANCER PATIENTS UNDERGOING ADJUVANT RADIOTHERAPY: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. UNLABELLED: OBJECTIVES. THIS STUDY COMPARES THE EFFECTS OF AN INTEGRATED YOGA PROGRAM WITH BRIEF SUPPORTIVE THERAPY IN BREAST CANCER OUTPATIENTS UNDERGOING ADJUVANT RADIOTHERAPY AT A CANCER CENTER. METHODS: EIGHTY-EIGHT STAGE II AND III BREAST CANCER OUTPATIENTS ARE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO RECEIVE YOGA (N = 44) OR BRIEF SUPPORTIVE THERAPY (N = 44) PRIOR TO RADIOTHERAPY TREATMENT. ASSESSMENTS INCLUDE DIURNAL SALIVARY CORTISOL LEVELS 3 DAYS BEFORE AND AFTER RADIOTHERAPY AND SELF-RATINGS OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND STRESS COLLECTED BEFORE AND AFTER 6 WEEKS OF RADIOTHERAPY. RESULTS: ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE REVEALS SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN ANXIETY (P < .001), DEPRESSION (P = .002), PERCEIVED STRESS (P < .001), 6 A.M. SALIVARY CORTISOL (P = .009), AND POOLED MEAN CORTISOL (P = .03) IN THE YOGA GROUP COMPARED WITH CONTROLS. THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN MORNING SALIVARY CORTISOL LEVEL AND ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. CONCLUSION: YOGA MIGHT HAVE A ROLE IN MANAGING SELF-REPORTED PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AND MODULATING CIRCADIAN PATTERNS OF STRESS HORMONES IN EARLY BREAST CANCER PATIENTS UNDERGOING ADJUVANT RADIOTHERAPY.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
3 1087  46 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY COMPARES THE EFFECTS OF AN INTEGRATED YOGA PROGRAM WITH BRIEF SUPPORTIVE THERAPY ON DISTRESSFUL SYMPTOMS IN BREAST CANCER OUTPATIENTS UNDERGOING ADJUVANT RADIOTHERAPY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: EIGHTY-EIGHT STAGE II AND III BREAST CANCER OUTPATIENTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO RECEIVE YOGA (N = 44) OR BRIEF SUPPORTIVE THERAPY (N = 44) PRIOR TO THEIR RADIOTHERAPY TREATMENT. INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF YOGA SESSIONS LASTING 60 MIN DAILY WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP WAS IMPARTED SUPPORTIVE THERAPY ONCE IN 10 DAYS DURING THE COURSE OF THEIR ADJUVANT RADIOTHERAPY. ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED ROTTERDAM SYMPTOM CHECK LIST AND EUROPEAN ORGANIZATION FOR RESEARCH IN THE TREATMENT OF CANCER-QUALITY OF LIFE (EORTC QOL C30) SYMPTOM SCALE. ASSESSMENTS WERE DONE AT BASELINE AND AFTER 6 WEEKS OF RADIOTHERAPY TREATMENT. RESULTS: A GLM REPEATED-MEASURES ANOVA SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS (P = 0.01), FATIGUE (P = 0.007), INSOMNIA (P = 0.001), AND APPETITE LOSS (P = 0.002) OVER TIME IN THE YOGA GROUP AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE ACTIVITY LEVEL (P = 0.02) IN THE YOGA GROUP AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AND FATIGUE, NAUSEA AND VOMITING, PAIN, DYSPNEA, INSOMNIA, APPETITE LOSS, AND CONSTIPATION. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE ACTIVITY LEVEL AND FATIGUE, NAUSEA AND VOMITING, PAIN, DYSPNEA, INSOMNIA, AND APPETITE LOSS. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS SUGGEST BENEFICIAL EFFECTS WITH YOGA INTERVENTION IN MANAGING CANCER-AND TREATMENT-RELATED SYMPTOMS IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
4  199  57 A RESEARCH PROTOCOL FOR A PILOT, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL DESIGNED TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF A DYADIC VERSUS INDIVIDUAL YOGA PROGRAM FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS OF GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY. BACKGROUND: ALTHOUGH THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF A PRIMARY BRAIN TUMOR PRESENT UNIQUE CHALLENGES TO PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS, EVIDENCE-BASED SUPPORTIVE CARE INTERVENTIONS ARE GENERALLY LACKING. THE PRIMARY AIM OF THIS RESEARCH PROTOCOL IS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING A DYADIC YOGA (DY) VERSUS A CAREGIVER YOGA (CY) INTERVENTION OR A WAIT-LIST CONTROL (WLC) GROUP USING A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL DESIGN. METHODS: SEVENTY-FIVE GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS ARE RANDOMIZED TO THE DY, CY, OR A WLC GROUP. PATIENT-CAREGIVER DYADS IN THE DY GROUP AND CAREGIVERS IN THE CY GROUP RECEIVE 15 SESSIONS (45 MIN EACH) OVER THE COURSE OF PATIENTS' STANDARD RADIOTHERAPY (6 WEEKS). PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS IN ALL GROUPS COMPLETE BASELINE ASSESSMENTS OF SYMPTOMS, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), AND HEALTH UTILIZATION OUTCOMES PRIOR TO RANDOMIZATION. FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENTS ARE PERFORMED 6 WEEKS AND THEN AGAIN 3 MONTHS LATER. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME IS FEASIBILITY (I.E., >/= 50% OF ELIGIBLE DYADS CONSENT, >/= 70% OF ENROLLED DYADS COMPLETE ALL ASSESSMENTS, AND >/= 50% OF ALL PRACTICE SESSIONS ARE ATTENDED). WE WILL ALSO PERFORM PRIMARILY DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSES OF THE SELF-REPORTED OUTCOMES (E.G., FATIGUE, OVERALL QOL) AND EXPLORE POTENTIAL INTERVENTION MODERATORS (E.G., PERFORMANCE STATUS) TO INFORM A LARGER FUTURE TRIAL. CONCLUSION: THIS TRIAL WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING THE FEASIBILITY OF A DYADIC VERSUS A CAREGIVER YOGA INTERVENTION REGARDING SYMPTOM, QOL, AND HEALTH UTILIZATION OUTCOMES IN GLIOMA PATIENTS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS.

5  648  84 DYADIC YOGA PROGRAM FOR PATIENTS UNDERGOING THORACIC RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS: RESULTS OF A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: THORACIC RADIOTHERAPY (TRT) MAY RESULT IN TOXICITIES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH PERFORMANCE DECLINES AND POOR QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) FOR PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS TO ESTABLISH FEASIBILITY AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF A DYADIC YOGA (DY) INTERVENTION AS A SUPPORTIVE CARE STRATEGY. METHODS: PATIENTS WITH STAGE I TO III NON-SMALL CELL LUNG OR ESOPHAGEAL CANCER UNDERGOING TRT AND THEIR CAREGIVERS (N = 26 DYADS) WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 15-SESSION DY OR A WAITLIST CONTROL (WLC) GROUP. PRIOR TO TRT AND RANDOMIZATION, BOTH GROUPS COMPLETED MEASURES OF QOL (SF-36) AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (CES-D). PATIENTS ALSO COMPLETED THE 6-MINUTE WALK TEST (6MWT). DYADS WERE REASSESSED ON THE LAST DAY OF TRT AND 3 MONTHS LATER. RESULTS: A PRIORI FEASIBILITY CRITERIA WERE MET REGARDING CONSENT (68%), ADHERENCE (80%), AND RETENTION (81%) RATES. CONTROLLING FOR RELEVANT COVARIATES, MULTILEVEL MODELING ANALYSES REVEALED SIGNIFICANT CLINICAL IMPROVEMENTS FOR PATIENTS IN THE DY GROUP COMPARED WITH THE WLC GROUP FOR THE 6MWT (MEANS: DY = 473 M VS WLC = 397 M, D = 1.19) AND SF-36 PHYSICAL FUNCTION (MEANS: DY = 38.77 VS WLC = 30.88; D = .66) AND SOCIAL FUNCTION (MEANS: DY = 45.24 VS WLC = 39.09; D = .44) ACROSS THE FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. CAREGIVERS IN THE DY GROUP REPORTED MARGINALLY CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN SF-36 VITALITY (MEANS: DY = 53.05 VS WLC = 48.84; D = .39) AND ROLE PERFORMANCE (MEANS: DY = 52.78 VS WLC = 48.59; D = .51) RELATIVE TO THOSE IN THE WLC GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: THIS NOVEL SUPPORTIVE CARE PROGRAM APPEARS TO BE FEASIBLE AND BENEFICIAL FOR PATIENTS UNDERGOING TRT AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. A LARGER EFFICACY TRIAL WITH A MORE STRINGENT CONTROL GROUP IS WARRANTED.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
6 2654  36 YOGA IMPROVES QUALITY OF LIFE AND BENEFIT FINDING IN WOMEN UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY FOR BREAST CANCER. THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY. SIXTY-ONE WOMEN WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER A YOGA OR A WAIT-LIST GROUP. YOGA CLASSES WERE TAUGHT BIWEEKLY DURING THE 6 WEEKS OF RADIOTHERAPY. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED MEASURES OF QOL, FATIGUE, BENEFIT FINDING (FINDING MEANING IN THE CANCER EXPERIENCE), INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS, SLEEP DISTURBANCES, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, AND ANXIETY BEFORE RADIOTHERAPY AND THEN AGAIN 1 WEEK, 1 MONTH, AND 3 MONTHS AFTER THE END OF RADIOTHERAPY. GENERAL LINEAR MODEL ANALYSES REVEALED THAT COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP, THE YOGA GROUP REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER GENERAL HEALTH PERCEPTION (P = .005) AND PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING SCORES (P = .04) 1 WEEK POSTRADIOTHERAPY; HIGHER LEVELS OF INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS 1 MONTH POSTRADIOTHERAPY (P = .01); AND GREATER BENEFIT FINDING 3 MONTHS POSTRADIOTHERAPY (P = .01). THERE WERE NO OTHER GROUP DIFFERENCES IN OTHER QOL SUBSCALES FOR FATIGUE, DEPRESSION, OR SLEEP SCORES. EXPLORATORY ANALYSES INDICATED THAT INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS 1 MONTH AFTER RADIOTHERAPY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH BENEFIT FINDING 3 MONTHS AFTER RADIOTHERAPY (R = .36, P = .011). OUR RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE YOGA PROGRAM WAS ASSOCIATED WITH STATISTICALLY AND CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN ASPECTS OF QOL.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
7 1097  43 EFFECTS OF YOGA PROGRAM ON QUALITY OF LIFE AND AFFECT IN EARLY BREAST CANCER PATIENTS UNDERGOING ADJUVANT RADIOTHERAPY: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY COMPARES THE EFFECTS OF AN INTEGRATED YOGA PROGRAM WITH BRIEF SUPPORTIVE THERAPY IN BREAST CANCER OUTPATIENTS UNDERGOING ADJUVANT RADIOTHERAPY AT A CANCER CENTRE. METHODS: EIGHTY-EIGHT STAGE II AND III BREAST CANCER OUTPATIENTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO RECEIVE YOGA (N = 44) OR BRIEF SUPPORTIVE THERAPY (N = 44) PRIOR TO THEIR RADIOTHERAPY TREATMENT. INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF YOGA SESSIONS LASTING 60 MIN DAILY WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP WAS IMPARTED SUPPORTIVE THERAPY ONCE IN 10 DAYS. ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED EUROPEAN ORGANIZATION FOR RESEARCH IN THE TREATMENT OF CANCER-QUALITY OF LIFE (EORTCQOL C30) FUNCTIONAL SCALES AND POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECT SCHEDULE (PANAS). ASSESSMENTS WERE DONE AT BASELINE AND AFTER 6 WEEKS OF RADIOTHERAPY TREATMENT. RESULTS: AN INTENTION TO TREAT GLM REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE ACROSS GROUPS OVER TIME FOR POSITIVE AFFECT, NEGATIVE AFFECT AND EMOTIONAL FUNCTION AND SOCIAL FUNCTION. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN POSITIVE AFFECT (ES = 0.59, P = 0.007, 95%CI 1.25 TO 7.8), EMOTIONAL FUNCTION (ES = 0.71, P = 0.001, 95%CI 6.45 TO 25.33) AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION (ES = 0.48, P = 0.03, 95%CI 1.2 TO 18.5), AND DECREASE IN NEGATIVE AFFECT (ES = 0.84, P<0.001, 95%CI -13.4 TO -4.4) IN THE YOGA GROUP AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN POSITIVE AFFECT WITH ROLE FUNCTION, SOCIAL FUNCTION AND GLOBAL QUALITY OF LIFE. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN NEGATIVE AFFECT WITH PHYSICAL FUNCTION, ROLE FUNCTION, EMOTIONAL FUNCTION AND SOCIAL FUNCTION.

OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY COMPARES THE ANXIOLYTIC EFFECTS OF A YOGA PROGRAM AND SUPPORTIVE THERAPY IN BREAST CANCER OUTPATIENTS UNDERGOING CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT AT A CANCER CENTRE. METHODS: NINETY-EIGHT STAGE II AND III BREAST CANCER OUTPATIENTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO RECEIVE YOGA (N=45) OR BRIEF SUPPORTIVE THERAPY (N=53) PRIOR TO THEIR PRIMARY TREATMENT I.E., SURGERY. ONLY THOSE SUBJECTS WHO RECEIVED SURGERY FOLLOWED BY ADJUVANT RADIOTHERAPY AND SIX CYCLES OF CHEMOTHERAPY WERE CHOSEN FOR ANALYSIS FOLLOWING INTERVENTION (YOGA, N=18, CONTROL, N=20). INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF YOGA SESSIONS LASTING 60MIN DAILY WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP WAS IMPARTED SUPPORTIVE THERAPY DURING THEIR HOSPITAL VISITS AS A PART OF ROUTINE CARE. ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED SPEILBERGER'S STATE TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY AND SYMPTOM CHECKLIST. ASSESSMENTS WERE DONE AT BASELINE, AFTER SURGERY, BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER RADIOTHERAPY AND CHEMOTHERAPY. RESULTS: A GLM-REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA SHOWED OVERALL DECREASE IN BOTH SELF-REPORTED STATE ANXIETY (P<0.001) AND TRAIT ANXIETY (P=0.005) IN YOGA GROUP AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS. THERE WAS A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN ANXIETY STATES AND TRAITS WITH SYMPTOM SEVERITY AND DISTRESS DURING CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT INTERVALS. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA CAN BE USED FOR MANAGING TREATMENT-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND ANXIETY IN BREAST CANCER OUTPATIENTS.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
9 1194  35 EXAMINING MEDIATORS AND MODERATORS OF YOGA FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY. HYPOTHESIS THIS STUDY EXAMINES MODERATORS AND MEDIATORS OF A YOGA INTERVENTION TARGETING QUALITY-OF-LIFE (QOL) OUTCOMES IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER RECEIVING RADIOTHERAPY.METHODS WOMEN UNDERGOING 6 WEEKS OF RADIOTHERAPY WERE RANDOMIZED TO A YOGA (YG; N = 53) OR STRETCHING (ST; N = 56) INTERVENTION OR A WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (WL; N = 54). DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND SLEEP DISTURBANCES WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE. MEDIATOR (POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS SYMPTOMS, BENEFIT FINDING, AND CORTISOL SLOPE) AND OUTCOME (36-ITEM SHORT FORM [SF]-36 MENTAL AND PHYSICAL COMPONENT SCALES [MCS AND PCS]) VARIABLES WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE, END-OF-TREATMENT, AND 1-, 3-, AND 6-MONTHS POSTTREATMENT. RESULTS BASELINE DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (P = .03) AND SLEEP DISTURBANCES (P < .01) MODERATED THE GROUP X TIME EFFECT ON MCS, BUT NOT PCS. WOMEN WITH HIGH BASELINE DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IN YG REPORTED MARGINALLY HIGHER 3-MONTH MCS THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN WL (P = .11). WOMEN WITH HIGH BASELINE SLEEP DISTURBANCES IN YG REPORTED HIGHER 3-MONTHS MCS THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN WL (P < .01) AND HIGHER 6-MONTH MCS THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN ST (P = .01). YG LED TO GREATER BENEFIT FINDING THAN ST AND WL ACROSS THE FOLLOW-UP (P = .01). THREE-MONTH BENEFIT FINDING PARTIALLY MEDIATED THE EFFECT OF YG ON 6-MONTH PCS. POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS SYMPTOMS AND CORTISOL SLOPE DID NOT MEDIATE TREATMENT EFFECT ON QOL. CONCLUSION YOGA MAY PROVIDE THE GREATEST MENTAL-HEALTH-RELATED QOL BENEFITS FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING PRE-RADIOTHERAPY SLEEP DISTURBANCE AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. YOGA MAY IMPROVE PHYSICAL-HEALTH-RELATED QOL BY INCREASING ABILITY TO FIND BENEFIT IN THE CANCER EXPERIENCE.	2016

AIMS: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA PROGRAM WITH SUPPORTIVE THERAPY COUNSELING ON MOOD STATES, TREATMENT-RELATED SYMPTOMS, TOXICITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN STAGE II AND III BREAST CANCER PATIENTS ON CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT. METHODS: NINETY-EIGHT STAGE II AND III BREAST CANCER PATIENTS UNDERWENT SURGERY FOLLOWED BY ADJUVANT RADIOTHERAPY (RT) OR CHEMOTHERAPY (CT) OR BOTH AT A CANCER CENTER WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO RECEIVE YOGA (N = 45) AND SUPPORTIVE THERAPY COUNSELING (N = 53) OVER A 24-WEEK PERIOD. INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF 60-MIN YOGA SESSIONS, DAILY WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP WAS IMPARTED SUPPORTIVE THERAPY DURING THEIR HOSPITAL VISITS. ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED STATE-TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY, BECK'S DEPRESSION INVENTORY, SYMPTOM CHECKLIST, COMMON TOXICITY CRITERIA, AND FUNCTIONAL LIVING INDEX-CANCER. ASSESSMENTS WERE DONE AT BASELINE, AFTER SURGERY, BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER RT AND SIX CYCLES OF CT. RESULTS: BOTH GROUPS HAD SIMILAR BASELINE SCORES. THERE WERE 29 DROPOUTS 12 (YOGA) AND 17 (CONTROLS) FOLLOWING SURGERY. SIXTY-NINE PARTICIPANTS CONTRIBUTED DATA TO THE CURRENT ANALYSIS (33 IN YOGA, AND 36 IN CONTROLS). AN ANCOVA, ADJUSTING FOR BASELINE DIFFERENCES, SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE FOR THE YOGA INTERVENTION AS COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP DURING RT (FIRST RESULT) AND CT (SECOND RESULT), IN (I) ANXIETY STATE BY 4.72 AND 7.7 POINTS, (II) DEPRESSION BY 5.74 AND 7.25 POINTS, (III) TREATMENT-RELATED SYMPTOMS BY 2.34 AND 2.97 POINTS, (IV) SEVERITY OF SYMPTOMS BY 6.43 AND 8.83 POINTS, (V) DISTRESS BY 7.19 AND 13.11 POINTS, AND (VI) AND IMPROVED OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE BY 23.9 AND 31.2 POINTS AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS. TOXICITY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS IN THE YOGA GROUP (P = 0.01) DURING CT. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS SUGGEST A POSSIBLE USE FOR YOGA AS A PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS UNDERGOING CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT.	2017	
                                                   
11 2762  75 YOGA PROGRAM FOR HIGH-GRADE GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS. BACKGROUND: DESPITE THEIR HIGH SYMPTOM BURDEN AND POOR PROGNOSIS, EVIDENCE-BASED SUPPORTIVE CARE INTERVENTIONS FOR ADULTS WITH HIGH-GRADE GLIOMA (HGG) AND THEIR CAREGIVERS ARE LACKING. THUS, WE AIMED TO ESTABLISH FEASIBILITY OF A PATIENT-CAREGIVER DYADIC YOGA PROGRAM (DYP) FOR NEWLY DIAGNOSED HGG PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS TARGETING QUALITY-OF-LIFE (QOL) OUTCOMES. METHOD: IN THIS SINGLE-ARM PILOT TRIAL, DYADS PARTICIPATED IN A 12-SESSION DYP PROGRAM ACROSS THE COURSE OF PATIENTS' RADIOTHERAPY. THE INTERVENTION FOCUSED ON BREATHING EXERCISES, GENTLE MOVEMENTS, AND GUIDED MEDITATIONS. WE TRACKED FEASIBILITY DATA AND ASSESSED LEVELS OF CANCER-RELATED SYMPTOMS (MD ANDERSON SYMPTOM INVENTORY [MDASI]), DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (CENTERS FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES-DEPRESSION SCALE), FATIGUE (BRIEF FATIGUE INVENTORY), SLEEP DISTURBANCES (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX [PSQI]), AND OVERALL MENTAL AND PHYSICAL QOL (36-ITEM SHORT-FORM SURVEY [SF-36]) AT BASELINE AND POST-DYP, WHICH WAS AT THE END OF RADIOTHERAPY. RESULTS: WE APPROACHED 6 DYADS OF WHICH 5 DYADS (86%) CONSENTED AND COMPLETED ALL 12 SESSIONS AND PRE/POST ASSESSMENTS. ALL PATIENTS (MEAN AGE: 52 YEARS, 80% FEMALE, 80% GRADE IV) AND CAREGIVERS (MEAN AGE: 58 YEARS, 80% FEMALE, 60% SPOUSES) PERCEIVED BENEFIT FROM THE PROGRAM. PAIRED T TESTS REVEALED A MARGINALLY SIGNIFICANT, YET CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL, DECREASE IN PATIENT'S CANCER SYMPTOMS ( T = 2.32, P = .08; MDASI MEAN; PRE = 1.75, POST = 1.04). THERE WERE CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN PATIENT SLEEP DISTURBANCES (PSQI MEAN: PRE = 10.75, POST = 8.00) AND IMPROVEMENTS IN PATIENT AND CAREGIVER MENTAL QOL (MCS OF SF-36 MEAN: PRE = 42.35, POST = 52.34, AND PRE = 45.14, POST = 51.43, RESPECTIVELY). CONCLUSIONS: THIS NOVEL SUPPORTIVE CARE PROGRAM APPEARS TO BE SAFE, FEASIBLE, ACCEPTABLE, AND SUBJECTIVELY USEFUL FOR HGG PATIENTS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. THERE WAS ALSO PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE REGARDING QOL TREATMENT GAINS FOR BOTH PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS.	2018	
                      
12  974  47 EFFECTS OF AN INTEGRATED YOGA PROGRAM ON SELF-REPORTED DEPRESSION SCORES IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS UNDERGOING CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. AIM: TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA PROGRAM WITH SUPPORTIVE THERAPY ON SELF-REPORTED SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS UNDERGOING CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: NINETY-EIGHT BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WITH STAGE II AND III DISEASE FROM A CANCER CENTER WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO RECEIVE YOGA (N = 45) AND SUPPORTIVE THERAPY (N = 53) OVER A 24-WEEK PERIOD DURING WHICH THEY UNDERWENT SURGERY FOLLOWED BY ADJUVANT RADIOTHERAPY (RT) OR CHEMOTHERAPY (CT) OR BOTH. THE STUDY STOPPAGE CRITERIA WAS PROGRESSIVE DISEASE RENDERING THE PATIENT BEDRIDDEN OR ANY PHYSICAL MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURY RESULTING FROM INTERVENTION OR LESS THAN 60% ATTENDANCE TO YOGA INTERVENTION. SUBJECTS UNDERWENT YOGA INTERVENTION FOR 60 MIN DAILY WITH CONTROL GROUP UNDERGOING SUPPORTIVE THERAPY DURING THEIR HOSPITAL VISITS. BECK'S DEPRESSION INVENTORY (BDI) AND SYMPTOM CHECKLIST WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE, AFTER SURGERY, BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER RT AND SIX CYCLES OF CT. WE USED ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE (INTENT-TO-TREAT) TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF INTERVENTION ON DEPRESSION SCORES AND PEARSON CORRELATION ANALYSES TO EVALUATE THE BIVARIATE RELATIONSHIPS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 69 PARTICIPANTS CONTRIBUTED DATA TO THE CURRENT ANALYSIS (YOGA, N = 33, AND CONTROLS, N = 36). THERE WAS 29% ATTRITION IN THIS STUDY. THE RESULTS SUGGEST AN OVERALL DECREASE IN SELF-REPORTED DEPRESSION WITH TIME IN BOTH THE GROUPS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN DEPRESSION SCORES IN THE YOGA GROUP AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS FOLLOWING SURGERY, RT, AND CT (P < 0.01). THERE WAS A POSITIVE CORRELATION (P < 0.001) BETWEEN DEPRESSION SCORES WITH SYMPTOM SEVERITY AND DISTRESS DURING SURGERY, RT, AND CT. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS SUGGEST POSSIBLE ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFECTS WITH YOGA INTERVENTION IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS UNDERGOING CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT.	2015	
                                                                                                                       
13 1036  45 EFFECTS OF YOGA IN MANAGING FATIGUE IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE IS WIDELY PREVALENT IN CANCER PATIENTS AND AFFECTS QUALITY OF LIFE IN ADVANCED CANCER PATIENTS. FATIGUE IS CAUSED DUE TO BOTH PSYCHOLOGIC DISTRESS AND PHYSIOLOGICAL SEQUEL FOLLOWING CANCER PROGRESSION AND ITS TREATMENT. IN THIS STUDY, WE EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGIC INTERVENTION IN MANAGING FATIGUE IN METASTATIC BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. METHODS: NINETY-ONE PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC BREAST CANCER WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE INTEGRATED YOGA PROGRAM (N = 46) OR SUPPORTIVE THERAPY AND EDUCATION (N = 45) OVER A 3-MONTH PERIOD. ASSESSMENTS SUCH AS PERCEIVED STRESS, FATIGUE SYMPTOM INVENTORY, DIURNAL SALIVARY CORTISOL, AND NATURAL KILLER CELL COUNTS WERE CARRIED OUT BEFORE AND AFTER INTERVENTION. ANALYSIS WAS DONE USING AN INTENTION-TO-TREAT APPROACH. POSTMEASURES FOR THE ABOVE OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED USING ANCOVA WITH RESPECTIVE BASELINE MEASURE AS A COVARIATE. RESULTS: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA REDUCES PERCEIVED STRESS (P = 0.001), FATIGUE FREQUENCY (P < 0.001), FATIGUE SEVERITY (P < 0.001), INTERFERENCE (P < 0.001), AND DIURNAL VARIATION (P < 0.001) WHEN COMPARED TO SUPPORTIVE THERAPY. THERE WAS A POSITIVE CORRELATION OF CHANGE IN FATIGUE SEVERITY WITH 9 A.M. SALIVARY CORTISOL LEVELS. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA REDUCES FATIGUE IN ADVANCED BREAST CANCER PATIENTS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
14 2701  40 YOGA INTERVENTION FOR PATIENTS WITH PROSTATE CANCER UNDERGOING EXTERNAL BEAM RADIATION THERAPY: A PILOT FEASIBILITY STUDY. PURPOSE: STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED BENEFICIAL HEALTH EFFECTS FROM YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN CANCER PATIENTS, BUT PREDOMINANTLY IN BREAST CANCER. RESEARCH ON ITS ROLE IN ALLEVIATING PROSTATE CANCER (PC) PATIENTS' SIDE EFFECTS HAS BEEN LACKING. OUR PRIMARY GOAL WAS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF RECRUITING PC PATIENTS ON A CLINICAL TRIAL OF YOGA WHILE THEY UNDERWENT EXTERNAL BEAM RADIATION THERAPY (RT). METHODS: TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA INTERVENTIONS WERE OFFERED THROUGHOUT THE RT COURSE (6-9 WEEKS). BASELINE DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION WAS COLLECTED. FEASIBILITY WAS DECLARED IF 15 OF THE FIRST 75 ELIGIBLE PC PATIENTS APPROACHED (20%) WERE SUCCESSFULLY ACCRUED AND COMPLETED THE INTERVENTION. ADDITIONAL END POINTS INCLUDED STANDARDIZED ASSESSMENTS OF FATIGUE, ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION (ED), URINARY INCONTINENCE (UI), AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AT TIME POINTS BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER RT. RESULTS: BETWEEN MAY 2013 AND JUNE 2014, 68 ELIGIBLE PC PATIENTS WERE IDENTIFIED. 23 PATIENTS (34%) DECLINED, AND 45 (56%) CONSENTED TO THE STUDY. 18 (40%) WERE VOLUNTARILY WITHDRAWN DUE TO TREATMENT CONFLICTS. OF THE REMAINING 27, 12 (30%) PARTICIPATED IN >/=50% OF CLASSES, AND 15 (59%) WERE EVALUABLE. SEVERITY OF FATIGUE SCORES DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT VARIABILITY, WITH FATIGUE INCREASING BY WEEK 4, BUT THEN IMPROVING OVER THE COURSE OF TREATMENT (P = .008). ED, UI, AND GENERAL QOL SCORES DEMONSTRATED REASSURINGLY STABLE, ALBEIT NOT SIGNIFICANT TRENDS. CONCLUSIONS: A STRUCTURED YOGA INTERVENTION OF TWICE-WEEKLY CLASSES IS FEASIBLE FOR PC PATIENTS DURING A 6- TO 9-WEEK COURSE OF OUTPATIENT RADIOTHERAPY. PRELIMINARY RESULTS ARE PROMISING, SHOWING STABLE MEASUREMENTS IN FATIGUE, SEXUAL HEALTH, UI, AND GENERAL QOL.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
15 1980  34 SLEEP MODERATES THE EFFECTS OF TIBETAN YOGA FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY. THIS STUDY EXAMINED SELF-REPORTED AND ACTIGRAPHY-ASSESSED SLEEP AND DEPRESSION AS MODERATORS OF THE EFFECT OF A TIBETAN YOGA INTERVENTION ON SLEEP AND DEPRESSION AMONG WOMEN UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY FOR BREAST CANCER. THIS IS A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF AN RCT EXAMINING A 4-SESSION TIBETAN YOGA PROGRAM (TYP; N = 74) VERSUS STRETCHING PROGRAM (STP; N = 68) OR USUAL CARE (UC; N = 85) ON SELF-REPORTED SLEEP (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI), ACTIGRAPHY-ASSESSED SLEEP EFFICIENCY (SE)) AND DEPRESSION (CENTERS FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES DEPRESSION SCALE; CES-D) FOR WOMEN UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY FOR BREAST CANCER. DATA WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE AND 1-WEEK AND 3-MONTH POST-INTERVENTION. BASELINE PSQI, ACTIGRAPHY-SE, AND CES-D WERE EXAMINED AS MODERATORS OF THE EFFECT OF GROUP ON PSQI, ACTIGRAPHY-SE, AND CES-D 1 WEEK AND 3 MONTHS AFTER TREATMENT. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT BASELINE ACTIGRAPHY-SE X GROUP EFFECT ON PSQI AT 1 WEEK (P < .001) AND 3 MONTHS (P = .002) AND ON CES-D AT 3 MONTHS (P = .049). SPECIFICALLY, THE NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION OF BASELINE ACTIGRAPHY-SE WITH SUBSEQUENT PSQI AND CES-D WAS BUFFERED FOR WOMEN IN THE TYP AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT IN STP, COMPARED TO THOSE IN THE UC. BASELINE PSQI AND CES-D WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT MODERATORS OF THE EFFECT OF GROUP ON ANY OUTCOME. BEHAVIORALLY ASSESSED SLEEP MAY BE A MORE ROBUST INDICATOR OF WHICH PATIENTS ARE MOST APPROPRIATE FOR A YOGA INTERVENTION THAN SELF-REPORTED SLEEP QUALITY. WOMEN WITH POOR SLEEP EFFICIENCY MAY DERIVE THE GREATEST BENEFIT IN TERMS OF SLEEP QUALITY AND MOOD FROM A YOGA INTERVENTION.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
16 1862  47 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA AMONG A MULTIETHNIC SAMPLE OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS: EFFECTS ON QUALITY OF LIFE. PURPOSE: THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF YOGA, INCLUDING PHYSICAL POSES, BREATHING, AND MEDITATION EXERCISES, ON QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), FATIGUE, DISTRESSED MOOD, AND SPIRITUAL WELL-BEING AMONG A MULTIETHNIC SAMPLE OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-EIGHT PATIENTS (42% AFRICAN AMERICAN, 31% HISPANIC) RECRUITED FROM AN URBAN CANCER CENTER WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED (2:1 RATIO) TO A 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION (N = 84) OR A 12-WEEK WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 44). CHANGES IN QOL (EG, FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CANCER THERAPY) FROM BEFORE RANDOM ASSIGNMENT (T1) TO THE 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP (T3) WERE EXAMINED; PREDICTORS OF ADHERENCE WERE ALSO ASSESSED. NEARLY HALF OF ALL PATIENTS WERE RECEIVING MEDICAL TREATMENT. RESULTS: REGRESSION ANALYSES INDICATED THAT THE CONTROL GROUP HAD A GREATER DECREASE IN SOCIAL WELL-BEING COMPARED WITH THE INTERVENTION GROUP AFTER CONTROLLING FOR BASELINE SOCIAL WELL-BEING AND COVARIATES (P < .0001). SECONDARY ANALYSES OF 71 PATIENTS NOT RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY DURING THE INTERVENTION PERIOD INDICATED FAVORABLE OUTCOMES FOR THE INTERVENTION GROUP COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP IN OVERALL QOL (P < .008), EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING (P < .015), SOCIAL WELL-BEING (P < .004), SPIRITUAL WELL-BEING (P < .009), AND DISTRESSED MOOD (P < .031). SIXTY-NINE PERCENT OF INTERVENTION PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED CLASSES (MEAN NUMBER OF CLASSES ATTENDED BY ACTIVE CLASS PARTICIPANTS = 7.00 +/- 3.80), WITH LOWER ADHERENCE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED FATIGUE (P < .001), RADIOTHERAPY (P < .0001), YOUNGER AGE (P < .008), AND NO ANTIESTROGEN THERAPY (P < .02). CONCLUSION: DESPITE LIMITED ADHERENCE, THIS INTENT-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT YOGA IS ASSOCIATED WITH BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON SOCIAL FUNCTIONING AMONG A MEDICALLY DIVERSE SAMPLE OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. AMONG PATIENTS NOT RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY, YOGA APPEARS TO ENHANCE EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING AND MOOD AND MAY SERVE TO BUFFER DETERIORATION IN BOTH OVERALL AND SPECIFIC DOMAINS OF QOL.	2007	

17 2361  57 VIVEKANANDA YOGA PROGRAM FOR PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED LUNG CANCER AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS. BACKGROUND: THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ESTABLISH THE FEASIBILITY OF A COUPLE-BASED VIVEKANANDA YOGA (VKC) INTERVENTION IN LUNG CANCER PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS. SECONDLY, WE EXAMINED PRELIMINARY EFFICACY REGARDING QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) OUTCOMES. METHOD: IN THIS SINGLE-ARM FEASIBILITY TRIAL, PATIENTS WITH LUNG CANCER UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS PARTICIPATED IN A 15-SESSION VKC PROGRAM THAT FOCUSED ON THE INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF THE DYAD. WE ASSESSED PRE-AND POST-INTERVENTION LEVELS OF FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCES, PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, OVERALL QOL, SPIRITUALITY, AND RELATIONAL CLOSENESS. WE TRACKED FEASIBILITY DATA, AND PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED PROGRAM EVALUATIONS. RESULTS: WE APPROACHED 28 ELIGIBLE DYADS OF WHICH 15 (53%) CONSENTED AND 9 (60%) COMPLETED THE INTERVENTION. PATIENTS (MEAN AGE = 73 YEARS, 63% FEMALE, ALL STAGE III) AND CAREGIVERS (MEAN AGE = 62 YEARS, 38% FEMALE, 63% SPOUSES) COMPLETED A MEAN OF 10 SESSIONS AND 95.5% OF THEM RATED THE PROGRAM AS VERY USEFUL. PAIRED T TESTS REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PATIENTS' MENTAL HEALTH (D = 0.84; P = .04) AND A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN CAREGIVERS' SLEEP DISTURBANCES (D = 1.44; P = .02). ALTHOUGH NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT, FOR PATIENTS, EFFECT SIZES FOR CHANGE SCORES WERE MEDIUM FOR BENEFIT FINDING AND SMALL FOR DISTRESS (D = 0.65 AND 0.37, RESPECTIVELY). FOR CAREGIVERS, MEDIUM EFFECTS WERE FOUND FOR IMPROVEMENT IN PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING (D = 0.50). CONCLUSION: THIS NOVEL SUPPORTIVE CARE PROGRAM APPEARS TO BE SAFE, FEASIBLE, ACCEPTABLE, AND SUBJECTIVELY USEFUL FOR LUNG CANCER PATIENTS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS AND LENDS SUPPORT FOR FURTHER STUDY.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
18  975  39 EFFECTS OF AN INTEGRATED YOGA PROGRAMME ON CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA AND EMESIS IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE EFFECT OF AN INTEGRATED YOGA PROGRAMME ON CHEMOTHERAPY-RELATED NAUSEA AND EMESIS IN EARLY OPERABLE BREAST CANCER OUTPATIENTS. SIXTY-TWO SUBJECTS WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO RECEIVE YOGA (N = 28) OR SUPPORTIVE THERAPY INTERVENTION (N = 34) DURING THE COURSE OF THEIR CHEMOTHERAPY. BOTH GROUPS HAD SIMILAR SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC AND MEDICAL CHARACTERISTICS. INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF BOTH SUPERVISED AND HOME PRACTICE OF YOGA SESSIONS LASTING FOR 60 MIN DAILY, WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED SUPPORTIVE THERAPY AND COPING PREPARATION DURING THEIR HOSPITAL VISITS OVER A COMPLETE COURSE OF CHEMOTHERAPY. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS THE MORROW ASSESSMENT OF NAUSEA AND EMESIS (MANE) ASSESSED AFTER THE FOURTH CYCLE OF CHEMOTHERAPY. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED MEASURES FOR ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, QUALITY OF LIFE, DISTRESSFUL SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT-RELATED TOXICITY ASSESSED BEFORE AND DURING THE COURSE OF CHEMOTHERAPY. FOLLOWING YOGA, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN POST-CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA FREQUENCY (P = 0.01) AND NAUSEA INTENSITY (P = 0.01), AND INTENSITY OF ANTICIPATORY NAUSEA (P = 0.01) AND ANTICIPATORY VOMITING (P = 0.05) AS COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN MANE SCORES AND ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND DISTRESSFUL SYMPTOMS. IN CONCLUSION, THE RESULTS SUGGEST A POSSIBLE USE FOR STRESS REDUCTION INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS YOGA IN COMPLEMENTING CONVENTIONAL ANTIEMETICS TO MANAGE CHEMOTHERAPY-RELATED NAUSEA AND EMESIS.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
19 1461  41 INFLUENCE OF YOGA ON MOOD STATES, DISTRESS, QUALITY OF LIFE AND IMMUNE OUTCOMES IN EARLY STAGE BREAST CANCER PATIENTS UNDERGOING SURGERY. CONTEXT: BREAST CANCER PATIENTS AWAITING SURGERY EXPERIENCE HEIGHTENED DISTRESS THAT COULD AFFECT POSTOPERATIVE OUTCOMES. AIMS: THE AIM OF OUR STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON MOOD STATES, TREATMENT-RELATED SYMPTOMS, QUALITY OF LIFE AND IMMUNE OUTCOMES IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS UNDERGOING SURGERY. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: NINETY-EIGHT RECENTLY DIAGNOSED STAGE II AND III BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WERE RECRUITED FOR A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA PROGRAM WITH SUPPORTIVE THERAPY PLUS EXERCISE REHABILITATION ON POSTOPERATIVE OUTCOMES FOLLOWING SURGERY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SUBJECTS WERE ASSESSED PRIOR TO SURGERY AND FOUR WEEKS THEREAFTER. PSYCHOMETRIC INSTRUMENTS WERE USED TO ASSESS SELF-REPORTED ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, TREATMENT-RELATED DISTRESS AND QUALITY OF LIFE. BLOOD SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED FOR ENUMERATION OF T LYMPHOCYTE SUBSETS (CD4 %, CD8 % AND NATURAL KILLER (NK) CELL % COUNTS) AND SERUM IMMUNOGLOBULINS (IGG, IGA AND IGM). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: WE USED ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE TO COMPARE INTERVENTIONS POSTOPERATIVELY. RESULTS: SIXTY-NINE PATIENTS CONTRIBUTED DATA TO THE CURRENT ANALYSIS (YOGA N = 33, CONTROL N = 36). THE RESULTS SUGGEST A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE STATE (P = 0.04) AND TRAIT (P = 0.004) OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION (P = 0.01), SYMPTOM SEVERITY (P = 0.01), DISTRESS (P < 0.01) AND IMPROVEMENT IN QUALITY OF LIFE (P = 0.01) IN THE YOGA GROUP AS COMPARED TO THE CONTROLS. THERE WAS ALSO A SIGNIFICANTLY LESSER DECREASE IN CD 56% (P = 0.02) AND LOWER LEVELS OF SERUM IGA (P = 0.001) IN THE YOGA GROUP AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS FOLLOWING SURGERY. CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS SUGGEST POSSIBLE BENEFITS FOR YOGA IN REDUCING POSTOPERATIVE DISTRESS AND PREVENTING IMMUNE SUPPRESSION FOLLOWING SURGERY.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                               
20  972  29 EFFECTS OF AN INTEGRATED YOGA PROGRAM IN MODULATING PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS AND RADIATION-INDUCED GENOTOXIC STRESS IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY. EFFECTS OF AN INTEGRATED YOGA PROGRAM IN MODULATING PERCEIVED STRESS LEVELS, ANXIETY, AS WELL AS DEPRESSION LEVELS AND RADIATION-INDUCED DNA DAMAGE WERE STUDIED IN 68 BREAST CANCER PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY. TWO PSYCHOLOGICAL QUESTIONNAIRES--HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE (HADS) AND PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE (PSS)--AND DNA DAMAGE ASSAY WERE USED IN THE STUDY. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE HADS SCORES IN THE YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP, WHEREAS THE CONTROL GROUP DISPLAYED AN INCREASE IN THESE SCORES. MEAN PSS WAS DECREASED IN THE YOGA GROUP, WHEREAS THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT SHOW ANY CHANGE PRE- AND POSTRADIOTHERAPY. RADIATION-INDUCED DNA DAMAGE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ELEVATED IN BOTH THE YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS AFTER RADIOTHERAPY, BUT THE POSTRADIOTHERAPY DNA DAMAGE IN THE YOGA GROUP WAS SLIGHTLY LESS WHEN COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. AN INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA INTERVENTION MODULATES THE STRESS AND DNA DAMAGE LEVELS IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS DURING RADIOTHERAPY.	2007

1 1374 159 IMPACT OF AN INTEGRATED YOGA THERAPY PROTOCOL ON INSULIN RESISTANCE AND GLYCEMIC CONTROL IN PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS. OBJECTIVE: DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), CHARACTERIZED BY CHRONIC HYPERGLYCEMIA, IS ATTRIBUTED TO RELATIVE INSULIN DEFICIENCY OR RESISTANCE, OR BOTH. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT YOGA CAN MODULATE PARAMETERS OF INSULIN RESISTANCE. THE PRESENT STUDY EXPLORED THE POSSIBLE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF INTEGRATED YOGA THERAPY WITH REFERENCE TO GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND INSULIN RESISTANCE (IR) IN INDIVIDUALS WITH DIABETES MAINTAINED ON STANDARD ORAL MEDICAL CARE WITH YOGA THERAPY, COMPARED TO THOSE ON STANDARD ORAL MEDICAL CARE ALONE. METHODS: IN THIS STUDY, THE SUBJECTS ON YOGA INTERVENTION COMPRISED 35 TYPE 2 DIABETICS, AND AN EQUAL NUMBER OF VOLUNTEERS CONSTITUTED THE CONTROL GROUP. SUBJECTS RANGED IN AGE FROM 30 TO 70 YEARS, WITH HEMOGLOBIN A1C (HBA1C) TEST MORE THAN 7%, AND WERE MAINTAINED ON DIABETIC DIET AND ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC AGENTS. BLOOD SAMPLES WERE DRAWN PRIOR TO AND AFTER 120 DAYS OF INTEGRATED YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION. FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE (FBG), POST-PRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE (PPBG), HBA1C, INSULIN, AND LIPID PROFILE WERE ASSESSED IN BOTH THE INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS. RESULTS: THE INTERVENTION GROUP REVEALED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) (0.7 KG/M(2) MEDIAN DECREASE; P=0.001), FBG (20 MG/DL MEDIAN DECREASE; P<0.001), PPBG (33 MG/DL MEDIAN DECREASE; P<0.001), HBA1C (0.4% MEDIAN DECREASE; P<0.001), HOMEOSTATIC MODEL ASSESSMENT FOR INSULIN RESISTANCE (HOMA-IR) (1.2 MEDIAN DECREASE; P<0.001), CHOLESTEROL (13 MG/DL MEDIAN DECREASE, P=0.006), TRIACYLGLYCEROL (22 MG/DL MEDIAN DECREASE; P=0.027), LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (6 MG/DL MEDIAN DECREASE; P=0.004), AND VERY-LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN LEVELS (4 MG/DL MEDIAN DECREASE; P=0.032). INCREASES IN HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN AFTER 120 DAYS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT (6 MG/DL MEDIAN INCREASE; P=0.15). HOWEVER, WHEN COMPARED TO CHANGES OBSERVED IN PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP, ALL THESE IMPROVEMENTS PROVED TO BE SIGNIFICANT. CONCLUSION: ADMINISTRATION OF INTEGRATED YOGA THERAPY TO INDIVIDUALS WITH DIABETES LEADS TO A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN GLYCEMIC CONTROL, INSULIN RESISTANCE, AND KEY BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS.	2022	

2 1933  44 ROLE OF YOGA IN MODIFYING CERTAIN CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTIONS IN TYPE 2 DIABETIC PATIENTS. OBJECTIVES: 1. TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF FORTY DAYS OF YOGIC EXERCISES ON CARDIAC FUNCTIONS IN TYPE 2 DIABETICS. 2. TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF FORTY DAYS OF YOGIC EXERCISES ON BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL, GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN. METHODS: THE PRESENT STUDY DONE IN TWENTY-FOUR TYPE 2 DM CASES PROVIDES METABOLIC AND CLINICAL EVIDENCE OF IMPROVEMENT IN GLYCAEMIC CONTROL AND AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS. THESE MIDDLE-AGED SUBJECTS WERE TYPE II DIABETICS ON ANTIHYPERGLYCAEMIC AND DIETARY REGIMEN. THEIR BASELINE FASTING AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE AND GLYCOSYLATED HB WERE MONITORED ALONG WITH AUTONOMIC FUNCTION STUDIES. THE EXPERT GAVE THESE PATIENTS TRAINING IN YOGA ASANAS AND THEY PURSUED THOSE 30-40 MIN/DAY FOR 40 DAYS UNDER GUIDANCE. THESE ASANAS CONSISTED OF 13 WELL KNOWN POSTURES, DONE IN A SEQUENCE. AFTER 40 DAYS OF YOGA ASANAS REGIMEN, THE PARAMETERS WERE REPEATED. RESULTS: THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS FROM BASAL 190.08 +/- 18.54 IN MG/DL TO 141.5 +/- 16.3 IN MG/DL AFTER YOGA REGIMEN. THE POST PRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS DECREASED FROM 276.54 +/- 20.62 IN MG/DL TO 201.75 +/- 21.24 IN MG/DL, GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN SHOWED A DECREASE FROM 9.03 +/- 0.29% TO 7.83 +/- 0.53% AFTER YOGA REGIMEN. THE PULSE RATE, SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (FROM 86.45 +/- 2.0 TO 77.65 +/- 2.5 PULSE/MIN, FROM 142.0 +/- 3.9 TO 126.0 +/- 3.2 MM OF HG AND FROM 86.7 +/- 2.5 MM OF HG TO 75.5 +/- 2.1 MM OF HG AFTER YOGA REGIMEN RESPECTIVELY). CORRECTED QT INTERVAL (QTC) DECREASED FROM 0.42 +/- 0.0 TO 0.40 +/- 0.0. CONCLUSION: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT BETTER GLYCAEMIC CONTROL AND STABLE AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS CAN BE OBTAINED IN TYPE 2 DM CASES WITH YOGA ASANAS AND PRANAYAMA. THE EXACT MECHANISM AS TO HOW THESE POSTURES AND CONTROLLED BREATHING INTERACT WITH SOMATO-NEURO-ENDOCRINE MECHANISM AFFECTING METABOLIC AND AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS REMAINS TO BE WORKED OUT.	2004

4  138  38 A PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE ROLE OF YOGA ASANAS ON OXIDATIVE STRESS IN NON-INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS. NINETEEN SUBJECTS OF NON-INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS (NIDDM) BETWEEN THE AGE GROUP OF 30-60 YRS WERE STUDIED TO SEE THE EFFECT OF SPECIFIC YOGA ASANAS ON FASTING AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE (FBG, PPG), SERUM MALONDIALDEHYDE (MDA) AND GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN (HBA(1)) IN ADDITION TO DRUG TREATMENT AND DIET CONTROL. THE DURATION OF DIABETES RANGED FROM 1-10 YEARS. PATIENTS WITH RENAL, CARDIAC AND PROLIFERATIVE RETINAL DISEASES WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE STUDY. THE SAME PATIENTS SERVED AS THEIR OWN CONTROL. SUBJECTS WERE CALLED IN THE MORNING TO THE CARDIO-RESPIRATORY LABORATORY AND WERE GIVEN TRAINING BY A YOGA EXPERT. YOGA ASANAS INCLUDED SURYANAMSKAR, TADASAN, TRIKONASAN, PADMASAN, PRANAYAM, PASCHIMOTTANASAN, ARDHMATSYENDRASAN, PAVANMUKTHASAN, SARPASAN AND SHAVASAN. THE ASANAS WERE DONE EVERY DAY FOR 40 DAYS FOR 30-40 MIN. FBG, PPG, SERUM MDA AND HBA(1) WERE ESTIMATED BEFORE AND AFTER 40 DAYS OF YOGA ASANAS REGIMEN. SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION WAS SEEN IN FBG FROM 220 MG/DL TO 162 MG/DL, PPG FROM 311 MG/DL TO 255 MG/DL, MDA FROM 6 NMOL/L TO 3 NMOL/L AND HBA(1), FROM 8.8% TO 6.4%. SUBJECTS FELT BETTER AND WERE RELIEVED OF THEIR STRESSES AND HAD AN IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR DAY TO DAY PERFORMANCE. THE DECREASE WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P<0.0001 FOR FBG AND PPG, P<0.001 FOR MDA AND FOR HBA(1)).	2001	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
5 1033  33 EFFECTS OF YOGA IN ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS: A META-ANALYSIS. AIMS/INTRODUCTION: A META-ANALYSIS WAS CARRIED OUT TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE PUBMED, EMBASE AND COCHRANE DATABASES WERE SEARCHED TO OBTAIN ELIGIBLE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE, AND THE SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN A1C, TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL, LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDE AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE. WEIGHTED MEAN DIFFERENCES AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CIS) WERE CALCULATED. THE I(2) STATISTIC REPRESENTED HETEROGENEITY. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 12 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WITH A TOTAL OF 864 PATIENTS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. THE POOLED WEIGHTED MEAN DIFFERENCES WERE -23.72 MG/DL (95% CI -37.78 TO -9.65; P = 0.001; I(2) = 82%) FOR FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE AND -0.47% (95% CI -0.87 TO -0.07; P = 0.02; I(2) = 82%) FOR HEMOGLOBIN A1C. THE WEIGHTED MEAN DIFFERENCES WERE -17.38 MG/DL (95% CI -27.88 TO -6.89; P = 0.001; I(2) = 0%) FOR POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE, -18.50 MG/DL (95% CI -29.88 TO -7.11; P = 0.001; I(2) = 75%) FOR TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, 4.30 MG/DL (95% CI 3.25 TO 5.36; P < 0.00001; I(2) = 10%) FOR HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL, -12.95 MG/DL (95% CI -18.84 TO -7.06; P < 0.0001; I(2) = 37%) FOR LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL AND -12.57 MG/DL (95% CI -29.91 TO 4.76; P = 0.16; I(2) = 48%) FOR TRIGLYCERIDES. CONCLUSIONS: THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT YOGA BENEFITS ADULT PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS. HOWEVER, CONSIDERING THE LIMITED METHODOLOGY AND THE POTENTIAL HETEROGENEITY, FURTHER STUDIES ARE NECESSARY TO SUPPORT OUR FINDINGS AND INVESTIGATE THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA IN TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS PATIENTS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
6 1116  41 EFFICACY OF A VALIDATED YOGA PROTOCOL ON DYSLIPIDEMIA IN DIABETES PATIENTS: NMB-2017 INDIA TRIAL. BACKGROUND: DYSLIPIDEMIA IS CONSIDERED A RISK FACTOR IN TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM) RESULTING IN CARDIO-VASCULAR COMPLICATIONS. YOGA PRACTICES HAVE SHOWN PROMISING RESULTS IN ALLEVIATING TYPE 2 DIABETES PATHOLOGY. METHOD: IN THIS STRATIFIED TRIAL ON A YOGA BASED LIFESTYLE PROGRAM IN CASES WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES, IN THE RURAL AND URBAN POPULATION FROM ALL ZONES OF INDIA, A TOTAL OF 17,012 ADULTS (>20 YEARS) OF BOTH GENDERS WERE SCREENED FOR LIPID PROFILE AND SUGAR LEVELS. THOSE WHO SATISFIED THE SELECTION CRITERIA WERE TAUGHT THE DIABETES YOGA PROTOCOL (DYP) FOR THREE MONTHS AND THE DATA WERE ANALYZED. RESULTS: AMONG THOSE WITH DIABETES, 29.1% HAD ELEVATED TOTAL CHOLESTEROL (TC > 200 MG/DL) LEVELS THAT WERE HIGHER IN URBAN (69%) THAN RURAL (31%) DIABETES PATIENTS. THERE WAS A POSITIVE CORRELATION (P = 0.048) BETWEEN HBA1C AND TOTAL CHOLESTEROL LEVELS. DYP INTERVENTION HELPED IN REDUCING TC FROM 232.34 +/- 31.48 MG/DL TO 189.38 +/- 40.23 MG/DL WITH SIGNIFICANT PRE POST DIFFERENCE (P < 0.001). CONVERSION RATE FROM HIGH TC (>200 MG/DL) TO NORMAL TC (<200 MG/DL) WAS OBSERVED IN 60.3% OF CASES WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM); FROM HIGH LDL (>130 MG/DL) TO NORMAL LDL (<130 MG/DL) IN 73.7%; FROM HIGH TRIGLYCERIDE (>200 MG/DL) TO NORMAL TRIGLYCERIDE LEVEL (<200 MG/DL) IN 63%; FROM LOW HDL (<45 MG/DL) TO NORMAL HDL (>45 MG/DL) IN 43.7% OF T2DM PATIENTS AFTER THREE MONTHS OF DYP. CONCLUSIONS: A YOGA LIFESTYLE PROGRAM DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO MANAGE DIABETES HELPS IN REDUCING THE CO-MORBIDITY OF DYSLIPIDEMIA IN CASES OF PATIENTS WITH T2DM.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
7 2007  45 STUDY OF YOGA ASANAS IN ASSESSMENT OF PULMONARY FUNCTION IN NIDDM PATIENTS. CERTAIN YOGA ASANAS IF PRACTICED REGULARLY ARE KNOWN TO HAVE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON HUMAN BODY. THESE YOGA PRACTICES MIGHT BE INTERACTING WITH VARIOUS, SOMATO-NEURO-ENDOCRINE MECHANISMS TO HAVE THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS. THE PRESENT STUDY DONE IN TWENTY FOUR NIDDM PATIENTS OF 30 TO 60 YEAR OLD, PROVIDES METABOLIC AND CLINICAL EVIDENCE OF IMPROVEMENT IN GLYCAEMIC CONTROL AND PULMONARY FUNCTIONS. THESE MIDDLE-AGED SUBJECTS WERE TYPE II DIABETICS ON ANTIHYPERGLYCAEMIC AND DIETARY REGIMEN. THEIR BASELINE FASTING AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE AND GLYCOSYLATED HB WERE MONITORED ALONG WITH PULMONARY FUNCTION STUDIES. THE EXPERT GAVE THESE PATIENTS TRAINING IN YOGA ASANAS AND WERE PURSED 30-40 MIN/DAY FOR 40 DAYS UNDER GUIDANCE. THESE ASANAS CONSISTED OF 13 WELL KNOWN POSTURES, DONE IN A SEQUENCE. AFTER 40 DAYS OF YOGA ASANAS REGIMEN, THE PARAMETERS WERE REPEATED. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS (BASAL 190.08 +/- 90.8 IN MG/DL TO 141.5 +/- 79.8 IN MG/DL). THE POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS ALSO DECREASED (276.54 +/- 101.0 IN MG/DL TO 201.75 +/- 104.1 IN MG/DL), GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN SHOWED A DECREASE (9.03 +/- 1.4% TO 7.83 +/- 2.6%). THE FEV1, FVC, PEFR, MVV INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (1.81 +/- 0.4 LT TO 2.08 +/- 0.4 LT, 2.20 +/- 0.6 LT TO 2.37 +/- 0.5 LT, 3.30 +/- 1.0 LT/S TO 4.43 +/- 1.4 LT/S AND 64.59 +/- 25.7 LT MIN TO 76.28 +/- 28.1 LT/MIN RESPECTIVELY). FEV1/FVC% IMPROVED (85 +/- 0.2% TO 89 +/- 0.1%). THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT BETTER GLYCAEMIC CONTROL AND PULMONARY FUNCTIONS CAN BE OBTAINED IN NIDDM CASES WITH YOGA ASANAS AND PRANAYAMA. THE EXACT MECHANISM AS TO HOW THESE POSTURES AND CONTROLLED BREATHING, INTERACT WITH SOMATO-NEURO-ENDOCRINE MECHANISM AFFECTING METABOLIC AND PULMONARY FUNCTIONS REMAINS TO BE WORKED OUT.	2002	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
8 1476  47 INTEGRATED YOGA AND NATUROPATHY MODULE IN MANAGEMENT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME: A CASE REPORT. A 50-YEAR-OLD MALE PARTICIPANT WITH SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE, DIAGNOSED WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME (METS) [OBESITY, TYPE-2 DIABETES MELLITUS, HYPERTENSION] AND HYPOTHYROIDISM SINCE 2013, WAS ADMINISTERED INTEGRATED YOGA AND NATUROPATHY (IYN) FOR 6 WEEKS AS A TAILOR MADE INDIVIDUALIZED PROTOCOL AT THE RESIDENTIAL INTEGRATIVE MEDICAL FACILITY IN BANGALORE BETWEEN OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER 2015. THE RESULTS SHOWED REDUCTION IN WEIGHT (97.9 KG TO 74.6 KG), BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) (35.1 KG/M(2) TO 27.86 KG/M(2)), TOTAL CHOLESTEROL (192 MG% TO 145 MG%), TRIGLYCERIDES (153 MG% TO 90 MG%), LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (LDL) (124 MG% TO 81 MG%), HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (HDL) (40 MG% TO 46 MG%), FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE (110 MG/DL TO 75 MG/DL), POSTPRANDIAL GLUCOSE (267 MG/DL TO 100 MG/DL), GLYCATED HEMOGLOBIN (HBA1C) (7.8%-7.1%), THYROID STIMULATING HORMONE (TSH) (6.90 MUIU/ML TO 3.052 MUIU/ML). FOLLOWING THE INTERVENTION, THE ANTI-HYPERTENSIVE, ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC, THYROID RAISING AND ANALGESIC MEDICINES WERE NOT REQUIRED TO BE CONTINUED. HIS KNEE PAIN MINIMIZED ON DISCHARGE AS OBSERVED ON A VISUAL ANALOG SCALE. HE HAD AN IMPROVED FEELING OF WELLNESS AND OVERALL FUNCTIONAL HEALTH. ALL HIS PARAMETERS WERE WITHIN NORMAL RANGE AT THE 12-WEEKS FOLLOW-UP, AS HE HAD INCORPORATED THE LIFESTYLE PROGRAM INTO HIS DAILY ROUTINE. THIS CASE REPORT SUGGESTS THAT LIFESTYLE CHANGE BY INTEGRATION OF SPECIFIC NON-DRUG YOGA AND NATUROPATHIC INTERVENTION IS USEFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF METS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
9 1703  38 PARTITIONING OF RADIOLOGICAL, STRESS AND BIOCHEMICAL CHANGES IN PRE-DIABETIC WOMEN SUBJECTED TO DIABETIC YOGA PROTOCOL. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS AN ANCIENT SYSTEM OF WELLNESS WITH ASANA AND PRANAYAMA AS ITS MOST POPULAR AND PROPAGATED MODULES FOR MANAGEMENT OF LIFESTYLE DISORDERS. OBJECTIVES: THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO CHARACTERISE THE LIVER ABNORMALITIES, BIOCHEMICAL CHANGES, AND STRESS LEVELS AFTER YOGA INTERVENTION IN PREDIABETIC FEMALES. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 37 FEMALES WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO YOGA PRACTISING AND NON-PRACTISING CONTROL GROUPS. THE YOGA PRACTISING GROUP PERFORMED DIABETIC YOGA PROTOCOL (DYP) FOR 3 MONTHS. PARAMETERS INCLUDING SIZE OF LIVER, FATTY INFILTRATION, AND GRADE OF SEVERITY WERE MEASURED USING ULTRASONOGRAPHY ALONG WITH BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS AND STRESS LEVELS AT BASELINE AND AFTER YOGA PRACTICE. RESULTS: THE GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN (HBA1C) AND GLUCOSE LEVELS WERE FOUND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED IN PREDIABETIC (P=0.015) WOMEN AFTER PRACTISING DYP, ALTHOUGH CHOLESTEROL LEVELS INCREASED IN MENOPAUSAL WOMEN. NO ESCALATION OF FATTY LIVER WAS NOTED AMONG WOMEN PRACTISING DYP. CONCLUSION: DYP REDUCED THE HBA1C AND STRESS LEVELS AND THEREFORE, COULD BE A COST-EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR PREVENTING PREDIABETES TO DIABETES PROGRESSION.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
10  692  40 EFFECT OF COMMUNITY-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION ON OXIDATIVE STRESS AND GLYCEMIC PARAMETERS IN PREDIABETES: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: TO STUDY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON OXIDATIVE STRESS, GLYCEMIC STATUS, BLOOD PRESSURE AND ANTHROPOMETRY IN PREDIABETES. DESIGN: RANDOMIZED-CONTROLLED TRIAL. PARTICIPANTS: TWENTY NINE PREDIABETES SUBJECTS AGED 30-75 YEARS. SETTING: YOGA WAS CONDUCTED AT 4 DIFFERENT COMMUNITY DIABETES CLINICS IN MANGALORE, INDIA. INTERVENTIONS: PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER 3-MONTH YOGA OR WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUPS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: MALONDIALDEHYDE, GLUTATHIONE, VITAMIN C, VITAMIN E, SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE, PLASMA GLUCOSE, GLYCATED HAEMOGLOBIN, BMI, WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE, WAIST-TO-HIP RATIO AND BLOOD PRESSURE. RESULTS: YOGA INTERVENTION RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN MALONDIALDEHYDE (P<0.001), RELATIVE TO THE CONTROL GROUP. IN COMPARISON WITH THE CONTROL, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN BMI, WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE, SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND FASTING GLUCOSE LEVELS AT FOLLOW-UP. NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN GLYCATED HAEMOGLOBIN, WAIST-TO-HIP RATIO OR ANY OF THE ANTIOXIDANTS WAS OBSERVED. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA INTERVENTION MAY BE HELPFUL IN CONTROL OF OXIDATIVE STRESS IN PREDIABETES SUBJECTS. YOGA CAN ALSO BE BENEFICIAL IN REDUCTION IN BMI, WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE, SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND FASTING GLUCOSE. EFFECT OF YOGA ON ANTIOXIDANT PARAMETERS WAS NOT EVIDENT IN THIS STUDY. THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY NEED TO BE CONFIRMED IN LARGER TRIALS INVOLVING ACTIVE CONTROL GROUPS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
11  497  46 COMBINED AYURVEDA AND YOGA PRACTICES FOR NEWLY DIAGNOSED TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS: A CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: THE INCREASING PREVALENCE OF TYPE 2 DIABETES IN INDIA IS A CAUSE FOR NATIONAL CONCERN, PARTICULARLY THE SPIRALING COST BURDEN TO THE COUNTRY. AS ONE APPROACH TO STOP ITS INCREASE, YOGA MEDICINE HAS BEEN WIDELY IMPLEMENTED, FINDING POPULARITY WITH ALL SOCIAL STRATA. HERE, WE REPORT A STUDY SUGGESTING THAT TREATMENT WITH FRESH HERBAL JUICES AND YOGA CAN IMPROVE THE LEVELS OF BLOOD GLUCOSE AND HEMOGLOBIN A1C (HBA1C) IN PEOPLE WITH PRE-DIABETES. METHODS: STUDY DESIGN: 3-ARM CONTROLLED TRIAL 3 MONTHS IN DURATION. PARTICIPANTS: 157 MALE PRISONERS WITH NEWLY DIAGNOSED, HIGH FASTING BLOOD SUGAR (FBS) AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD SUGAR (PPBS) LEVELS. GROUP INTERVENTIONS: (1) RASAHARA AND YOGA, (2) YOGA, (3) NO INTERVENTION. ASSESSMENTS: FBS AND PPBS LEVELS WERE MEASURED EVERY 2 WEEKS; HBA1C AND BLOOD LIPIDS WERE DETERMINED PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT DECREASES OCCURRED IN THE FBS (-21.13 +/- 21.16 MG/DL) AND PPBS LEVELS (-15.02 +/- 14.89 MG/DL) IN GROUP 1 (BOTH P < 0.0001) AND IN THE FBS LEVEL (20.62 +/- 32.68 MG/DL) IN GROUP 2 (P = 0.0005), WHILE THE INCREASES IN GROUP 3 ATTAINED SIGNIFICANCE ONLY FOR THE PPBS LEVEL (9.62 +/- 21.83 MG/DL) (P = 0.0022). OBSERVED CHANGES IN HBA1C WERE: GROUP 1, -0.044 +/- 0.059 MG/DL; GROUP 2, +0.024 +/- 0.456 MG/DL (NOT SIGNIFICANT); AND GROUP 3, +0.365 +/- 0.369 MG/DL (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY OF YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF DIABETES SHOWS THAT ALL MALE PRISONERS COULD BENEFIT FROM THE YOGA PRISON PROGRAMS. ADDITION OF YOGA PROGRAMS TO STATE AND FEDERAL ACTIVITIES AT ALL LEVELS IS NOW NATIONAL POLICY IN INDIA. FOLLOW-UP STUDIES SHOULD BE CARRIED OUT TO OBTAIN MORE ROBUST RESULTS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
12 2463  53 YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS. PURPOSE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF 12 WEEKS YOGIC INTERVENTION ON BLOOD SUGAR AND LIPID PROFILE IN ELDER WOMEN WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: TWENTY ELDERLY (AGE RANGE 55-70 YEARS) T2DM WOMEN WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS, NAMELY, YOGIC INTERVENTION GROUP (YIG: N = 10, AGE 64.70 +/- 4.03, BODY MASS INDEX [BMI] 24.26 +/- 3.40) AND CONTROL GROUP (CG: N = 10, AGE 64.40 +/- 4.79, BMI 24.28 +/- 2.36). YIG UNDERWENT YOGA PRACTICE (ASANAS, KRIYAS, PRANAYAMAS) FOR 12 WEEKS (3 SESSIONS/WEEK), WHILE THE CG CONTINUED THEIR USUAL ROUTINE ACTIVITIES. STANDING HEIGHT, BODY WEIGHT, BMI, BLOOD SUGAR, AND LIPID PROFILE WERE MEASURED BEFORE COMMENCEMENT AND AFTER 6 AND 12 WEEKS OF YOGIC INTERVENTION IN BOTH GROUPS. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.01) DECREASE IN FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE, POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD SUGAR, TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDES, LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN, AND VERY LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN, WITH A SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.01) INCREASE IN HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN LEVEL FROM ITS INITIAL VALUE IN YIG, WHILE SHOWING INSIGNIFICANT RESULT IN CG. CONCLUSION: IT CAN BE SAID THAT YOGIC INTERVENTION MAY HAVE THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON BLOOD SUGAR AND LIPID PROFILE IN ELDERLY WOMEN WITH T2DM.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
13  685  45 EFFECT OF AN INTEGRATED NATUROPATHY AND YOGA PROGRAM ON LONG-TERM GLYCEMIC CONTROL IN TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS PATIENTS: A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY. AIM: LIFESTYLE IS AN IMPORTANT RISK FACTOR FOR INCREASING THE PREVALENCE OF DIABETES IN THE INDIAN POPULATION. IN THIS STUDY, WE EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF NATUROPATHY TREATMENT, SALT-RESTRICTED LOW-CALORIE DIETS, AND YOGA IN LONG-TERM GLYCEMIC CONTROL IN PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS. METHODS: IN THIS PROSPECTIVE, LONGITUDINAL, TWO-ARM COHORT STUDY, PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS REFERRED FROM A TERTIARY CARE CENTER UNDERGOING A 3-MONTH RESIDENTIAL NATUROPATHY TREATMENT WERE COMPARED WITH THOSE UNDERGOING ONLY CONVENTIONAL MANAGEMENT ON GLYCEMIC CONTROL. BOTH FASTING AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE (PPBG) LEVELS WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE, 3 MONTHS FOLLOWING INTERVENTION, AT 6 MONTHS, AND 12 MONTHS FROM THE STUDY START. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING REPEATED-MEASURES ANOVA WITH POST HOC BONFERRONI CORRECTION. RESULTS: NATUROPATHY AND YOGA INTERVENTION SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED PPBG LEVELS (P < 0.001), GLYCATED HEMOGLOBIN LEVELS (P < 0.001), AND REDUCED REQUIREMENT FOR ANTIDIABETIC MEDICATIONS (P < 0.008) IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP COMPARED TO CONTROLS. THE EFFECTS WERE MORE PROFOUND IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING INTERVENTION AND LASTED UP TO 6 MONTHS FROM THE START OF THE STUDY. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS SUGGEST BENEFIT WITH AN INTENSIVE RESIDENTIAL NATUROPATHY-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION PROGRAM. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS ARE NEEDED TO FURTHER VALIDATE THE FINDINGS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
14  691  56 EFFECT OF COMMUNITY-BASED STRUCTURED YOGA PROGRAM ON HBA1C LEVEL AMONG TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS PATIENTS: AN INTERVENTIONAL STUDY. CONTEXT: IN VIEW OF THE RISING BURDEN OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM) CASES IN INDIA, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR AN EFFECTIVE, LOW-COST, SUSTAINABLE INTERVENTION CONTROLLING DIABETES THUS PREVENTING COMPLICATIONS. AIMS: THIS STUDY AIMED TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF STRUCTURED YOGA PROGRAMS ON DIABETES. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: THIS WAS A COMMUNITY-BASED INTERVENTIONAL STUDY THAT WAS CONDUCTED IN AN URBAN RESETTLEMENT COLONY OF DELHI, INDIA. KNOWN DIABETES PATIENTS WITH GLYCATED HEMOGLOBIN (HB1AC) >/=6.5% WERE ENROLLED FROM 12 RANDOMLY SELECTED BLOCKS OF THE COMMUNITY WITH A SAMPLE SIZE OF 192 IN EACH INTERVENTION AND WAIT-LISTED CONTROL ARM. THE INTERVENTION WAS STRUCTURED YOGA OF 50 MIN DAILY, 2 CONSECUTIVE WEEKS IN A NEARBY PARK AND HEALTH CENTER FOLLOWED BY TWICE A WEEK HOME PRACTICE UP TO THE 3(RD) MONTH. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS HBA1C% AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES WERE LIPID PROFILE AND FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: APER-PROTOCOL ANALYSIS WAS DONE. MEAN, STANDARD DEVIATION (SD), AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL WERE ESTIMATED. THE LEVEL OF SIGNIFICANCE WAS CONSIDERED FOR 0.05. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE OF HB1AC (0.5%, SD = 1.5, P = 0.02), TOTAL CHOLESTEROL (11.7 MG/DL, SD = 40.5, P < 0.01), AND LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (3.2 MG/DL, SD = 37.4, P < 0.01) FROM BASELINE TO END LINE IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP. THESE CHANGES IN INTERVENTION GROUP WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE CHANGE IN THE WAIT-LISTED CONTROL GROUP. THE OTHER VARIABLES DID NOT CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY. CONCLUSIONS: IT REVEALED THAT STRUCTURED YOGA PROGRAM IMPROVED GLYCEMIC OUTCOME AND LIPID PROFILE OF INDIVIDUALS IN A COMMUNITY-BASED SETTING. YOGA CAN BE A FEASIBLE STRATEGY TO CONTROL HYPERGLYCEMIA, LIPID LEVELS, AND CAN HELP BETTER CONTROL TYPE 2 DM.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
15 1453  45 INFLUENCE OF PRANAYAMAS AND YOGA-ASANAS ON SERUM INSULIN, BLOOD GLUCOSE AND LIPID PROFILE IN TYPE 2 DIABETES. A DISTINGUISHABLE FEATURE OF TYPE 2 DIABETES BESIDES HYPERGLYCEMIA AND DERANGED LIPID PROFILE IS AN IMPAIRED INSULIN SECRETION, PERIPHERAL INSULIN RESISTANCE AND OBESITY WHICH HAS BECOME A MAJOR HEALTH CONCERN WORLDWIDE. INDIA WITH AN ESTIMATED 31MILLION DIABETICS IN 2000 AND 79MLLIONS BY THE YR 2030 HAS THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF TYPE 2 DIABETICS IN THE WORLD. IN THIS STUDY, WE AIMED TO SEE IF YOGA-ASANAS AND PRANAYAMAS HAVE ANY INFLUENCE IN MODIFYING CERTAIN BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS. SIXTY PATIENTS OF UNCOMPLICATED TYPE 2 DIABETES (AGE 35-60 YRS OF 1-10 YRS DURATION) WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: GROUP 1 (N=30): PERFORMED YOGA ALONG WITH THE CONVENTIONAL HYPOGLYCEMIC MEDICINES AND GROUP 2 (N=30): PATIENTS WHO ONLY RECEIVED CONVENTIONAL MEDICINES. DURATION OF THE STUDY WAS 45 DAYS. BASAL RECORDINGS OF BLOOD GLUCOSE (FASTING AND POST-PRANDIAL), LIPID PROFILE AND SERUM INSULIN WERE TAKEN AT THE TIME OF RECRUITMENT AND THE SECOND READING AFTER FORTY FIVE DAYS. RESULTS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ALL THE BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS IN GROUP 1 WHILE GROUP 2 SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ONLY FEW PARAMETERS, THUS SUGGESTING A BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF YOGA REGIMEN ON THESE PARAMETERS IN DIABETIC PATIENTS.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
16  823  44 EFFECT OF YOGA ON GLUCOSE CONTROL AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS OF PREDIABETES. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE EFFECT OF YOGA ON FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE (FPG), POSTPRANDIAL PLASMA GLUCOSE, AND HEMOGLOBIN A1C (HBA1C) AND ALSO ON QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: THIS WAS A COHORT STUDY IN WHICH 100 DIAGNOSED CASES OF PREDIABETES WERE RECRUITED FOR DOING SPECIFIC YOGA, AND THEY THEMSELVES ACT AS CONTROL FOR THE STUDY. THE MEASUREMENT AND COMPARISON OF FPG, PRANDIAL PLASMA GLUCOSE (PPG), AND HBA1C WERE DONE AT THREE DIFFERENT TIME INTERVALS, THAT IS, BASELINE, 3 MONTHS, AND AT 6 MONTHS. THE ASSESSMENT OF QOL WAS DONE USING SF-36 SCALE. RESULTS: ONE HUNDRED PREDIABETIC CASES WERE SELECTED FOR THE STUDY IN WHICH IMPAIRED FASTING GLUCOSE (IFG) WAS PRESENT MORE IN YOUNGER POPULATION COMPARED TO IMPAIRED GLUCOSE TOLERANCE (IGT) AND IFG PLUS IGT BOTH OF WHICH ARE MORE PREVALENT IN MIDDLE AGE GROUP. THE YOGA THERAPY WAS FOUND TO HAVE FAVORABLE EFFECT ON FPG, PPG, AND HBA1C ALONG WITH VARIOUS ANTHROPOMETRY MEASURES STUDIED IN THIS STUDY. AFTER ADJUSTING CORRELATION COEFFICIENT FOR VARIOUS ANTHROPOMETRY MEASURES, YOGA WAS FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR CONTROLLING GLYCEMIC PARAMETERS IN PREDIABETICS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA IS A TYPE OF EXERCISE KNOWN TO IMPROVE GLYCEMIC CONTROL BY CHANGING ANTHROPOMETRY MEASURES, BUT OUR STUDY AIDS IN KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT BEYOND THIS KNOWN FACT THROUGH OTHER MECHANISMS YET TO BE EXPLORED.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
17 2056  45 THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF YOGA IN DIABETES. TWENTY NIDDM SUBJECTS (MILD TO MODERATE DIABETICS) IN THE AGE GROUP OF 30-60 YEARS WERE SELECTED FROM THE OUT PATIENT CLINIC OF G.T.B. HOSPITAL. THEY WERE ON A 40 DAYS YOGA ASANA REGIME UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A YOGA EXPERT. 13 SPECIFIC YOGA ASANAS < OR = DONE BY TYPE 2 DIABETES PATIENTS INCLUDED. SURYA NAMASKAR, TRIKONASANA, TADASANA, SUKHASANA, PADMASANA, BHASTRIKA PRANAYAMA, PASHIMOTTANASANA, ARDHMATSYENDRASANA, PAWANMUKTASANA, BHUJANGASANA, VAJRASANA, DHANURASANA AND SHAVASANA ARE BENEFICIAL FOR DIABETES MELLITUS. SERUM INSULIN, PLASMA FASTING AND ONE HOUR POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS AND ANTHROPOMETRIC PARAMETERS WERE MEASURED BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA ASANAS. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN FASTING GLUCOSE LEVELS FROM BASAL 208.3 +/- 20.0 TO 171.7 +/- 19.5 MG/DL AND ONE HOUR POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS DECREASED FROM 295.3 +/- 22.0 TO 269.7 +/- 19.9 MG/DL. THE EXACT MECHANISM AS TO HOW THESE POSTURES AND CONTROLLED BREATHING INTERACT WITH SOMATOENDOCRINE MECHANISM AFFECTING INSULIN KINETICS WAS WORKED OUT. A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN WAIST-HIP RATIO AND CHANGES IN INSULIN LEVELS WERE ALSO OBSERVED, SUGGESTING A POSITIVE EFFECT OF YOGA ASANAS ON GLUCOSE UTILISATION AND FAT REDISTRIBUTION IN NIDDM. YOGA ASANAS MAY BE USED AS AN ADJUNCT WITH DIET AND DRUGS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES.	2005	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
18 1104  44 EFFECTS OF YOGA VERSUS SHAM YOGA ON OXIDATIVE STRESS, GLYCEMIC STATUS, AND ANTHROPOMETRY IN TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS: A SINGLE-BLINDED RANDOMIZED PILOT STUDY. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN A BENEFICIAL ROLE OF YOGA IN TRE A T I N G TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS. THE PRESENT STUDY PROCEEDS IN THE FIELD BY PROVIDING AN ACTIVE CONTROL. WE AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF 3 MONTHS OF YOGA ON OXIDATIVE STRESS, GLYCEMIC STATUS, AND ANTHROPOMETRY IN TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS. FORTY PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE EITHER YOGA (N = 20) OR SHAM YOGA (N = 20) AS A CONTROL. YOGA INCLUDED POSTURES AND BREATHING EXERCISES, AND NONAEROBIC STRETCHING EXERCISE COMPRISED THE CONTROL. SIGNIFICANT WITHIN-GROUP DIFFERENCES IN MALONDIALDEHYDE, VITAMIN C, SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE, FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE, GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN, BODY MASS INDEX, WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE, AND BLOOD PRESSURE WERE EVIDENT IN BOTH GROUPS. YOGA PARTICIPANTS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN REDUCED GLUTATHIONE COMPARED TO CONTROLS. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS WERE OBSERVED IN ANY OTHER OUTCOME VARIABLES. YOGA AND SHAM YOGA HAD IDENTICAL EFFECTS ON OXIDATIVE STRESS, GLYCEMIC STATUS, AND ANTHROPOMETRY IN TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS. LEVELS OF REDUCED GLUTATHIONE IMPROVED ONLY IN THE YOGA GROUP. THIS RESEARCH NEEDS TO BE CONFIRMED BY LARGER AND SUFFICIENTLY POWERED STUDIES.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
19  959  42 EFFECTS OF A YOGA INTERVENTION ON LIPID PROFILES OF DIABETES PATIENTS WITH DYSLIPIDEMIA. OBJECTIVE: THE PRESENT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF DYSLIPIDEMIA IN PATIENTS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS. METHODS: THIS RANDOMIZED PARALLEL STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT IN MEDICAL COLLEGE TRIVANDRUM, KERALA, INDIA. HUNDRED TYPE 2 DIABETICS WITH DYSLIPIDEMIA WERE RANDOMIZED INTO CONTROL AND YOGA GROUPS. THE CONTROL GROUP WAS PRESCRIBED ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC DRUGS. THE YOGA GROUP PRACTICED YOGA DAILY FOR 1 H DURATION ALONG WITH ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC DRUGS FOR 3 MONTHS. THE LIPID PROFILES OF BOTH THE GROUPS WERE COMPARED AT THE START AND AT THE END OF 3 MONTHS. RESULTS: AFTER INTERVENTION WITH YOGA FOR A PERIOD OF 3 MONTHS THE STUDY GROUP SHOWED A DECREASE IN TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDES AND LDL, WITH AN IMPROVEMENT IN HDL. CONCLUSION: YOGA, BEING A LIFESTYLE INCORPORATING EXERCISE AND STRESS MANAGEMENT TRAINING, TARGETS THE ELEVATED LIPID LEVELS IN PATIENTS WITH DIABETES THROUGH INTEGRATED APPROACHES.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
20  926  48 EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA LIFESTYLE ON LIPID METABOLISM IN A VULNERABLE POPULATION-A COMMUNITY BASED MULTICENTER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: DYSLIPIDEMIA POSES A HIGH RISK FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND STROKE IN TYPE 2 DIABETES (T2DM). THERE ARE NO STUDIES ON THE IMPACT OF A VALIDATED INTEGRATED YOGA LIFESTYLE PROTOCOL ON LIPID PROFILES IN A HIGH-RISK DIABETES POPULATION. METHODS: HERE, WE REPORT THE RESULTS OF LIPID PROFILE VALUES OF 11,254 (YOGA 5932 AND CONTROL 5322) ADULTS (20-70 YEARS) OF BOTH GENDERS WITH HIGH RISK (>/=60 ON INDIAN DIABETES RISK SCORE) FOR DIABETES FROM A NATIONWIDE RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITY-BASED TWO GROUP (YOGA AND CONVENTIONAL MANAGEMENT) CLUSTER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. THE YOGA GROUP PRACTICED A VALIDATED INTEGRATED YOGA LIFESTYLE PROTOCOL (DYP) IN NINE DAY CAMPS FOLLOWED BY DAILY ONE-HOUR PRACTICE. BIOCHEMICAL PROFILING INCLUDED GLYCATED HEMOGLOBIN AND LIPID PROFILES BEFORE AND AFTER THREE MONTHS. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS (P < 0.001 ANCOVA) WITH IMPROVED SERUM TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDES, LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN, AND HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN IN THE YOGA GROUP COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. FURTHER, THE REGULATORY EFFECT OF YOGA WAS NOTED WITH A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE OR INCREASE IN THOSE WITH HIGH OR LOW VALUES OF LIPIDS, RESPECTIVELY, WITH MARGINAL OR NO CHANGE IN THOSE WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE. CONCLUSION: YOGA LIFESTYLE IMPROVES AND REGULATES (LOWERED IF HIGH, INCREASED IF LOW) THE BLOOD LIPID LEVELS IN BOTH GENDERS OF PREDIABETIC AND DIABETIC INDIVIDUALS IN BOTH RURAL AND URBAN INDIAN COMMUNITIES.	2021

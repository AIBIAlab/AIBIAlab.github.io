1  347 143 ASSESSING FIDELITY OF IMPLEMENTATION (FOI) FOR SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA INTERVENTIONS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. AS SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PROGRAMS GAIN POPULARITY, THE SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF FIDELITY OF PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION (FOI) IS CRITICAL TO PROVIDE A MORE ROBUST UNDERSTANDING OF THE CORE COMPONENTS OF MINDFULNESS AND YOGA INTERVENTIONS, THEIR POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE SPECIFIED TEACHER AND STUDENT OUTCOMES, AND OUR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT THESE PROGRAMS CONSISTENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY. THIS PAPER REVIEWS THE CURRENT STATE OF THE SCIENCE WITH RESPECT TO INCLUSION AND REPORTING OF FOI IN PEER-REVIEWED STUDIES EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND/OR YOGA PROGRAMS TARGETING STUDENTS AND/OR TEACHERS IMPLEMENTED IN GRADES KINDERGARTEN THROUGH TWELVE (K-12) IN NORTH AMERICA. ELECTRONIC SEARCHES IN PSYCHINFO AND WEB OF SCIENCE FROM THEIR INCEPTION THROUGH MAY 2014, IN ADDITION TO HAND SEARCHES OF RELEVANT REVIEW ARTICLES, IDENTIFIED 312 PUBLICATIONS, 48 OF WHICH MET INCLUSION CRITERIA. FINDINGS INDICATED A RELATIVE PAUCITY OF RIGOROUS FOI. FEWER THAN 10% OF STUDIES OUTLINED POTENTIAL CORE PROGRAM COMPONENTS OR REFERENCED A FORMAL THEORY OF ACTION, AND FEWER THAN 20% ASSESSED ANY ASPECT OF FOI BEYOND PARTICIPANT DOSAGE. THE EMERGING NATURE OF THE EVIDENCE BASE PROVIDES A CRITICAL WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY TO GRAPPLE WITH KEY ISSUES RELEVANT TO FOI OF MINDFULNESS-BASED AND YOGA PROGRAMS, INCLUDING IDENTIFYING ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT SHOULD BE FAITHFULLY IMPLEMENTED AND HOW WE MIGHT DEVELOP RIGOROUS MEASURES TO ACCURATELY CAPTURE THEM. CONSIDERATION OF THESE QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTED NEXT STEPS ARE INTENDED TO HELP ADVANCE THE EMERGING FIELD OF SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA INTERVENTIONS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
2 1737  37 PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND YOGA-BASED APPROACHES FOR PREGNANCY-RELATED LOW BACK AND PELVIC PAIN. OBJECTIVE: TO CONDUCT AN INTEGRATIVE REVIEW TO EVALUATE CURRENT LITERATURE ABOUT NONPHARMACOLOGIC, EASILY ACCESSIBLE MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES FOR PREGNANCY-RELATED LOW BACK AND PELVIC PAIN (PR-LBPP). DATA SOURCES: PUBMED, CINAHL, COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS. STUDY SELECTION: ORIGINAL RESEARCH ARTICLES WERE CONSIDERED FOR REVIEW IF THEY WERE FULL-LENGTH PUBLICATIONS WRITTEN IN ENGLISH AND PUBLISHED IN PEER-REVIEWED JOURNALS FROM 2005 THROUGH 2015, INCLUDED MEASURES OF PAIN AND SYMPTOMS RELATED TO PR-LBPP, AND EVALUATED TREATMENT MODALITIES THAT USED A PHYSICAL EXERCISE OR YOGA-BASED APPROACH FOR THE DESCRIBED CONDITIONS. DATA EXTRACTION: ELECTRONIC DATABASE SEARCHES YIELDED 1,435 ARTICLES. A TOTAL OF 15 ARTICLES MET ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR FURTHER REVIEW. DATA SYNTHESIS: THESE MODALITIES SHOW PRELIMINARY PROMISE FOR PAIN RELIEF AND OTHER RELATED SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING STRESS AND DEPRESSION. HOWEVER, OUR FINDINGS ALSO INDICATE SEVERAL GAPS IN KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THESE THERAPIES FOR PR-LBPP AND METHODOLOGIC ISSUES WITH THE CURRENT LITERATURE. CONCLUSION: ALTHOUGH ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS REQUIRED, THE RESULTS OF THIS INTEGRATIVE REVIEW SUGGEST THAT CLINICIANS MAY CONSIDER RECOMMENDING NONPHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT OPTIONS, SUCH AS GENTLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS, FOR PR-LBPP AND RELATED SYMPTOMS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
3 2711  29 YOGA KERNELS: A PUBLIC HEALTH MODEL FOR DEVELOPING AND DISSEMINATING EVIDENCE-BASED YOGA PRACTICES. MANY PEOPLE ARE DRAWN TO YOGA FOR ITS POTENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS. WITH ITS RISING POPULARITY, YOGA COULD BECOME A WIDELY USED PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION, BUT ITS SUCCESS DEPENDS ON FINDING EVIDENCE-BASED YOGA PRACTICES THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE AND FEASIBLE FOR A LARGE SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION. COMPLEXITY AND VARIABILITY CREATE BARRIERS TO THE ADOPTION AND MAINTENANCE OF YOGA PRACTICES. IN AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE THE STUDY, ADOPTION, AND MAINTENANCE OF THERAPEUTIC PRACTICES USED IN THE CONTEXT OF PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS, WE INTRODUCE THE CONCEPT OF "YOGA KERNELS," DEFINED AS DISCRETE, EVIDENCE-BASED YOGA PRACTICES THAT ARE AMENABLE TO SCIENTIFIC STUDY AND CAN BE EFFECTIVELY DISSEMINATED AS A PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION. YOGA IS REVIEWED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF A PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION USING THE REACH EFFECTIVENESS ADOPTION IMPLEMENTATION AND MAINTENANCE (RE-AIM) MODEL. THIS MODEL IS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE SUCCESSFUL ADOPTION AND MAINTENANCE OF GENERALIZABLE, EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS. IN RESPONSE TO THE CHALLENGES TO THE ADOPTION AND MAINTENANCE OF YOGA PRACTICES, WE PROPOSE THAT A POTENTIALLY FRUITFUL DIRECTION FOR YOGA RESEARCH IS MOVING AWAY FROM STUDYING YOGA CLASSES TO STUDYING SPECIFIC YOGA PRACTICES THAT ARE SIMPLER AND EASIER FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO USE. YOGA KERNELS COULD BE A UNIFYING CONCEPT TO IDENTIFY THERAPEUTIC USES OF YOGA AND HELP PEOPLE ADOPT AND MAINTAIN THESE PRACTICES AS PART OF A SYSTEMATIC PUBLIC HEALTH STRATEGY.	2019

5 1937  25 ROLE OF YOGA IN THE TREATMENT OF NEUROTIC DISORDERS: CURRENT STATUS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS. A LARGE NUMBER OF STUDIES HAVE CONSISTENTLY DEMONSTRATED THE POTENTIAL OF YOGA, NOT ONLY IN THE TREATMENT OF PSYCHIATRIC AND PSYCHOSOMATIC DISORDER BUT ALSO IN PROMOTING POSITIVE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. THIS PAPER REVIEWS VARIOUS STUDIES ON THE TREATMENT OF NEUROSIS WITH TECHNIQUES DERIVED FROM YOGA. A FEW LACUNAE HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND POSSIBLE DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH ARE OUTLINED. IT IS HOPED THAT RESEARCH ALONG THESE LINES WILL DEVELOP A STANDARDIZED METHOD OF YOGA THERAPY WHICH CAN BE UTILIZED AND INTEGRATED WITHIN THE EXISTING METHODS OF TREATMENT OF NEUROTIC DISORDERS.	1994	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
6 2580  30 YOGA FOR HEALTHY AGING: SCIENCE OR HYPE? YOGA, ONE OF THE WORLD'S OLDEST HEALTH SYSTEMS IS RECEIVING NEW ATTENTION FOR CLAIMS THAT IT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTHY AGING. UNTIL RECENTLY, SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE FOR ITS EFFICACY HAS RELIED HEAVILY ON SMALL AND POORLY-DESIGNED RESEARCH, BUT THIS IS CHANGING. MULTIPLE, WELL-DESIGNED STUDIES PROVIDE DATA SHOWING THAT YOGA PRACTICE HAS POSITIVE EFFECTS ON CELLULAR AGING, MOBILITY, BALANCE, MENTAL HEALTH, AND PREVENTION OF COGNITIVE DECLINE-ALL AREAS OF CONCERN FOR OLDER ADULTS. SINCE THE COST OF IMPLEMENTING YOGA-BASED COMMUNITY AND HOME-BASED INTERVENTIONS IS LOW-POLICYMAKERS ARE ALSO EYEING YOGA PRACTICE AS A COST-EFFECTIVE WAY TO REDUCE MEDICAL COSTS AND IMPROVE OUTCOMES AMONG A GROWING AGING POPULATION. THIS COMMENTARY REVIEWS THE EVIDENCE FOR BOTH PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS FROM YOGA, AS WELL AS CONCERNS ABOUT INJURIES THAT HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN TYPES OF YOGA PRACTICE. IT REVEALS A SURPRISING RANGE OF YOGA PROGRAMS AND DIFFICULTY LEVELS THAT PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALMOST ANYONE TO PARTICIPATE AND GAIN HEALTH BENEFITS WITH PRACTICE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
7 2556  23 YOGA FOR CHILDREN. THERE IS AN INCREASING INTEREST IN THE USE OF YOGA FOR CHILDREN TO CALM THE MIND AND INCREASE HEALTH AND WELL BEING. DESPITE SCANT BUT INCREASING EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN CHILDREN, SPECIAL YOGA PROGRAMS WITHIN SCHOOLS ARE BEING DEVELOPED FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS. THIS INCREASING POPULARITY OF THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA MAY ENCOURAGE PARENTS TO CONSIDER YOGA FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND REQUEST REFERRALS OR CLARIFICATION OF THE PURPORTED EFFECTS. A DESCRIPTION OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL BASIS OF YOGA, THE BASIC COMPONENTS OF A YOGA PRACTICE, SAFETY CONCERNS, AND HOW TO LOCATE AND EVALUATE A YOGA PROGRAM FOR CHILDREN WILL BE ADDRESSED.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
8 2630  24 YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION: FIVE QUESTIONS TO MOVE THE EVIDENCE-BASE FORWARD. YOGA-BASED PRACTICES, DERIVED FROM ANCIENT EASTERN MIND-BODY PRACTICES, HAVE GROWN IN POPULARITY IN THE WEST OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES. INCREASING EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFECTS OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS (YBIS). HOWEVER, DESPITE YOGA'S PROMISE AS A POTENTIAL TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION, THE LITERATURE TO DATE IS MARKED BY SUBSTANTIAL METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS, WHICH REMAIN A BARRIER TO THE INTEGRATION OF YBIS INTO CONVENTIONAL CLINICAL CARE. WE HIGHLIGHT FIVE KEY AREAS OF STUDY THAT NEED FURTHER INVESTIGATION TO FILL CRUCIAL GAPS IN THE LITERATURE-BASE TO ADVANCE YOGA RESEARCH AND YOGA'S POTENTIAL AS AN EFFECTIVE EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
9 2061  33 THE BENEFITS OF YOGA IN CHILDREN. THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN SUFFERING FROM STRESS AND ANXIETY IN MALAYSIA IS ON THE RISE. EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT MIND-BODY THERAPIES SUCH AS MINDFULNESS THERAPY, MEDITATION AND YOGA HAVE BEEN PRACTICED IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES TO REDUCE AND/OR MANAGE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF STRESS AND ANXIETY. THIS REVIEW ARTICLE LOOKS AT THE INTERVENTION OF YOGA AS A MEDITATIVE MOVEMENT PRACTICE IN HELPING SCHOOL CHILDREN MANAGE STRESS AND ANXIETY. ARTICLES WERE RETRIEVED USING A COMBINATION OF DATABASES INCLUDING PUBMED/MEDLINE, AND PSYCINFO. NOT ONLY PEER-REVIEWED ARTICLES, BUT ALSO THOSE WRITTEN IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE WERE INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW. ALL STUDIES REVIEWED HAD INCORPORATED SOME FORM OF MEDITATIVE MOVEMENT EXERCISE. THE INTERVENTION ENCOMPASSED ASANAS (POSTURES), PRANAYAMA (EXPANSION OF LIFE FORCE), DHARANA (CONCENTRATION) AND DHYANA (MEDITATION), WHICH ARE THE DIFFERENT PATHS IN YOGA. A TOTAL OF EIGHT ARTICLES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA AND WERE REVIEWED. THE FINDINGS OF THIS REVIEW REVEAL THAT THE PRACTICE OF YOGA HAS BROUGHT ABOUT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, IMPROVEMENT IN MANAGING AND REDUCING STRESS AND ANXIETY. DESPITE THE LIMITATIONS IN MOST, IF NOT ALL OF THE STUDIES REVIEWED, IN TERMS OF HETEROGENEITY AND SAMPLE SIZE, YOGA APPEARS TO BE AN EFFECTIVE MODALITY FOR HELPING CHILDREN COPE WITH STRESS AND ANXIETY. IT APPEARS THAT IF SCHOOLS IN MALAYSIA CAN INCORPORATE YOGA AS PART OF THE PHYSICAL EDUCATION CURRICULUM, IT WILL DEFINITELY BENEFIT THE STUDENTS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
10  346  31 ASSESSING FIDELITY OF CORE COMPONENTS IN A MINDFULNESS AND YOGA INTERVENTION FOR URBAN YOUTH: APPLYING THE CORE PROCESS. IN THE PAST YEARS, THE NUMBER OF MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION PROGRAMS HAS INCREASED STEADILY. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE INTENDED PROGRAM OUTCOMES, PROGRAM IMPLEMENTERS NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE ESSENTIAL AND INDISPENSABLE COMPONENTS THAT DEFINE A PROGRAM'S SUCCESS. THIS CHAPTER DESCRIBES THE COMPLEX PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING THE CORE COMPONENTS OF A MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PROGRAM FOR URBAN EARLY ADOLESCENTS THROUGH THE SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF FIDELITY OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTERVENTION. THE AUTHORS ILLUSTRATE THE CORE PROCESS [(C) CONCEPTUALIZE CORE COMPONENTS; (O) OPERATIONALIZE AND MEASURE; (R) RUN ANALYSES AND REVIEW IMPLEMENTATION FINDINGS; AND (E) ENHANCE AND REFINE], BASED ON DATA GAINED FROM A MINDFULNESS AND YOGA INTERVENTION STUDY CONDUCTED AS A COMMUNITY-ACADEMIC PARTNERSHIP IN BALTIMORE CITY.	2014

12 1992  24 STAFF PERSPECTIVES REGARDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A YOGA INTERVENTION WITH CHRONIC PAIN SELF-MANAGEMENT IN A CLINICAL SETTING. CHRONIC PAIN AFFECTS MILLIONS OF AMERICANS AND CAN BE ADDRESSED THROUGH MULTIPLE MODALITIES, INTERVENTIONS, AND STRATEGIES. YOGA AND SELF-MANAGEMENT HAVE BEEN PROVEN EFFECTIVE IN TREATING CHRONIC PAIN, BUT LITTLE RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONDUCTED ON THE FEASIBILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS RELATED TO THESE ALTERNATIVE INTERVENTION FORMS. IN OUR QUALITATIVE STUDY, WE EXAMINED STAFF PERCEPTIONS REGARDING THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING YOGA ALONG WITH ESTABLISHED SELF-MANAGEMENT AT A PAIN MANAGEMENT CLINIC IN COLORADO. WE UTILIZED THE IMPLEMENTATION DRIVERS OF COMPETENCY, ORGANIZATIONAL, AND LEADERSHIP, AND OUR ADDED HYPOTHETICAL DRIVER TO EXPLORE BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS RELATED TO PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT POSITIVE STAFF AND PATIENT ATTITUDES WERE CRUCIAL FOR SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION. WE ALSO IDENTIFIED PHYSICAL SPACE, TRANSPORTATION, AND SUPPORTIVE LEADERSHIP AS NECESSARY COMPONENTS OF PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION. FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO EXAMINE BARRIERS SUCH AS FUNDING TO ENSURE INTERVENTION SUSTAINABILITY AND THE NEED FOR ADEQUATE STAFFING.	2017

14 2600  19 YOGA FOR OSTEOARTHRITIS: NURSING AND RESEARCH CONSIDERATIONS. OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) IS A LEADING CAUSE OF PAIN AND DISABILITY WORLDWIDE. CURRENT TREATMENT GUIDELINES RECOMMEND NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES SUCH AS YOGA FOR FIRSTLINE TREATMENT OF OA. YOGA IS A PROMISING MIND-BODY PRACTICE THAT INCLUDES PHYSICAL POSTURES, BREATHING PRACTICES, AND MEDITATIVE MENTAL FOCUS. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS THE CURRENT EVIDENCE, AS WELL AS A PROPOSED CONCEPTUAL MODEL FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. CURRENT RESEARCH ON YOGA FOR OA IS SCANT BUT PROMISING, SHOWING SOME EVIDENCE OF REDUCED PAIN, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, AND DISABILITY. THE CONCEPTUAL MODEL DESCRIBED HERE PROPOSES MUSCULOSKELETAL EFFECTS (STRENGTHENING, FLEXIBILITY, RELAXATION), REDUCTION OF AUTONOMIC AROUSAL, AND THERAPEUTIC COGNITIVE PATTERNS (DISTRACTION, MINDFULNESS) AS POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT MECHANISMS OF YOGA. THIS ARTICLE ALSO DESCRIBES CONSIDERATIONS FOR PATIENTS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WHEN EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL USEFULNESS AND SAFETY OF YOGA PROGRAMS: YOGA STYLE, INSTRUCTOR QUALIFICATIONS, AND AMOUNT OF TIME SPENT IN YOGA PRACTICE.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
15 2375  30 WHITE PAPER: YOGA THERAPY AND PAIN-HOW YOGA THERAPY SERVES IN COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT, AND HOW IT CAN DO MORE. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE ROLE OF YOGA THERAPY IN COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT (CIPM). THE PAIN CRISIS IS DESCRIBED, AND HOW YOGA THERAPISTS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO ITS SOLUTION IS EXPLAINED. YOGA THERAPY CAN BE AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF THE MULTIDISCIPLINARY UNDERTAKING THAT WILL BE REQUIRED TO IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES AND ALTER THE TRAJECTORY OF THE GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS CONSTITUTED BY AN EPIDEMIC OF POORLY UNDERSTOOD AND INADEQUATELY ADDRESSED PAIN. ADDITIONAL CONTEXT AND EVIDENCE ARE PRESENTED TO DOCUMENT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTIONS TO SUPPORT PEOPLE LIVING WITH PAIN. THE WHITE PAPER CONCLUDES BY LISTING RECOMMENDATIONS TO PROVIDERS, CONSUMERS, PAYERS, AND LEGISLATORS, WHO TOGETHER CAN ADDRESS SYSTEMIC AND STRUCTURAL BARRIERS TO CIPM, AS WELL AS SUGGESTIONS FOR ENABLING THE YOGA THERAPY PROFESSION TO MORE FULLY PARTICIPATE IN THESE SOLUTIONS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
16 1894  33 RESEARCH TRENDS IN THE APPLICATION OF YOGA TO HUMAN HEALTH: A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH. YOGA IS AN INTEGRATIVE MIND-BODY SYSTEM OF WELLBEING DEVELOPED IN INDIA SINCE AT LEAST THREE MILLENNIA. YOGA HAS GAINED CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION IN RECENT DECADES, PARTLY DRIVEN BY RECENT RESEARCH AND EVIDENCE ABOUT ITS EFFECTIVENESS. IN THIS WORK, WE EXTRACTED RESEARCH TRENDS ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON HUMAN HEALTH FROM THE US NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE'S PUBMED DATABASE (PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL PAPERS). WE FOUND THAT YOGA RESEARCH SPANS ALL ORGAN SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM-WIDE ISSUES SUCH AS PAIN AND CANCER. RESEARCH ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM FAR OUTPACES OTHER SYSTEMS, WHICH IS EXPECTED BECAUSE OF THE EFFECTS OF BREATHING AND EXERCISE ON STRESS REDUCTION, WHICH HAS BEEN A MAJOR APPLICATION OF YOGA. THE NEXT CLUSTER OF IMPACT CONCERNS THE MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM AND PAIN (BOTH RELATED TO THE EXERCISE [ASANA] ASPECTS OF YOGA), AS WELL AS CARDIOVASCULAR/ENDOCRINE (ALSO RELATED TO STRESS) AND CANCER. STRESS AND MENTAL HEALTH, PAIN, DIABETES, AND CANCER ARE HEALTH ISSUES FOR WHICH A PERMANENT CURE IS NOT AVAILABLE IN A MAJORITY OF CASES IN MODERN MEDICINE, ALTHOUGH ALLEVIATING TREATMENTS ARE AVAILABLE. THIS HAS PROBABLY FUELED INTEREST IN COMPLEMENTARY APPROACHES SUCH AS YOGA FOR THESE HEALTH ISSUES. RESEARCH TIMELINE SHOWS THAT YOGA-RELATED RESEARCH LARGELY EXPANDED ONLY AFTER THE 2000S. THERE WAS A SPECIFIC UPTICK AFTER 2004. SIMILAR TRENDS ARE SEEN IF WE LOOK AT JUST CLINICAL TRIALS OR RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS (RCTS) OR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS. THE PERCENTAGE OF TRIALS (CLINICAL AND RCT) AMONG PUBLISHED LITERATURE IS AROUND 10-15 % THIS IS COMPARABLE TO OTHER FIELDS THAT GAINED TRACTION AROUND 2000S (E.G. NON-INVASIVE BRAIN STIMULATION). GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION SHOWS THAT 37% OF ALL YOGA RELATED RESEARCH OUTPUT ORIGINATES IN THE USA, 19% FROM INDIA, 13% FROM EUROPE AND 31% FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD. THEREFORE, THE INTEREST IS WIDESPREAD AND GLOBAL. AT LEAST THE UPTICK IN YOGA-RELATED RESEARCH IN THE US POST-2000S CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO A SUBSTANTIAL JUMP IN FUNDING BETWEEN 1998 AND 2005 FROM US NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH'S NATIONAL CENTER FOR COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH (NCCIH). WE CAN ONLY SURMISE THAT RESEARCH IN THIS FIELD REACHED A CRITICAL MASS IN LATE-1990S, WHICH INFUSED MORE MONEY INTO THIS FIELD, GENERATING MORE RESEARCH AND CREATING A POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOP THAT HAS SUSTAINED THE GROWTH SO FAR. WE PROPOSE THAT IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN OR EVEN ACCELERATE FUTURE RESEARCH IN THE AREA, RIGOR AND REPRODUCIBILITY MUST BE ENHANCED IN ADDITION TO PERFORMING MORE RCT AND CLINICAL TRIALS (INCREASING % OF TRIALS TO 20-25% FROM 10-15%). THE FRUITS OF RESEARCH IN THE FIELD HAS TO REACH THE COMMON MAN IN TERMS OF EVIDENCE-BASED SOLUTIONS TO HEALTH ISSUES. WITHOUT THIS, ACCELERATED FUNDING IN DEMOCRACIES SUCH AS INDIA AND THE USA WILL NOT BE REALIZABLE.	2020	

17  646  30 DOES YOGA THERAPY REDUCE BLOOD PRESSURE IN PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION?: AN INTEGRATIVE REVIEW. THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE WAS TO PRESENT A EVIDENCE-BASED INTEGRATIVE RESEARCH REVIEW THAT VALIDATES YOGA THERAPY AS AN EFFECTIVE COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE (BP). THE ARTICLE ALSO USES THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK OF DR HANS SELYE'S GENERAL ADAPTATION SYNDROME. YOGA RESEARCHERS DEMONSTRATE THAT YOGA WORKS BECAUSE IT MODULATES THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SYSTEM OF THE BODY, SPECIFICALLY ITS EFFECT ON THE HEART RATE. THIS REVIEW IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE YOGA PRESENTS AN EFFECTIVE METHOD OF TREATING HYPERTENSION THAT IS NONPHARMACOLOGIC AND THEREFORE THERE ARE NO ADVERSE EFFECTS AND THERE ARE OTHER VALUABLE HEALTH BENEFITS. RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT STRESS IS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO HIGH BP; HENCE, THE USE OF THE GENERAL ADAPTATION SYNDROME AND THE MOST IMPORTANT ATTRIBUTE OF YOGA, THAT IS, IT IS A PHYSICAL AND MENTAL EXERCISE PROGRAM, THAT IS IN SYNC WITH THE PHILOSOPHY OF HOLISTIC NURSING CARE WHERE ONE TREATS THE WHOLE INDIVIDUAL AND NOT JUST THE DISEASE. THE REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED WITH A SEARCH OF COMPUTERIZED DATABASES SUCH AS OVID, ACADEMIC SEARCH PREMIER, CINAHL, MEDLINE, AND HEALTH SOURCE: NURSING/ACADEMIC EDITION, PSYCHINFO, AS WELL AS RELIABLE WEB SITES SUCH AS THE CDC.GOV, AMONG OTHERS. AN INTEGRATIVE REVIEW SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED, AND 10 STUDIES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. THEY INCLUDE A COMBINATION OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS, QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES, AND PILOT STUDIES. YOGA THERAPY IS A MULTIFUNCTIONAL EXERCISE MODALITY WITH NUMEROUS BENEFITS. NOT ONLY DOES YOGA REDUCE HIGH BP BUT IT HAS ALSO BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO EFFECTIVELY REDUCE BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL, CHOLESTEROL LEVEL, AND BODY WEIGHT, MAJOR PROBLEMS AFFECTING THE AMERICAN SOCIETY. THE COMPLETED INTEGRATIVE REVIEW PROVIDES GUIDELINES FOR NURSING IMPLEMENTATION AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT OF HIGH BP.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
18 2366  29 WAR-RELATED MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND NEED FOR YOGA INTERVENTION STUDIES: A SCOPING REVIEW. CONFLICTS AND HUMANITARIAN CRISES LEAD TO SERIOUS MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS, INCLUDING DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, STRESS, AND COGNITIVE DECLINE. EXPOSURE TO THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IN EARLY LIFE CAN LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF DISORDERS SUCH AS MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, DEMENTIA, AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD), FOR WHICH NO TREATMENTS ARE AVAILABLE. IN THIS REVIEW, VARIOUS RESEARCH PAPERS HAVE BEEN COMPILED TO DEVELOP AN UNDERSTANDING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH OF POPULATION AFFECTED DUE TO WARS AND CONFLICTS AND HOW STRESS AND DEPRESSION CAN ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF DEMENTIA AND AD. DUE TO FAILURE OF DRUGS IN THE TREATMENT OF DEMENTIA AND AD, YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED APPROACH HAS BEEN PROPOSED FOR FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS. ALTHOUGH STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT YOGA AND MINDFULNESS CAN BE HELPFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF STRESS, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER IN THE WAR-AFFLICTED AREAS, LIMITED MECHANISTIC STUDIES IN YOGA AND MINDFULNESS REMAIN THE CHIEF CAUSE PRECLUDING ITS CLINICAL APPLICATION IN SUCH WARZONES. THE MOLECULAR STUDIES IN THE FIELD OF YOGA CAN BE UNDERTAKEN BY TARGETING THESE WARZONES. THIS REVIEW PROVIDES A SCIENTIFIC EVALUATION OF MIND-BODY TECHNIQUES AS A JUSTIFICATION FOR MENTAL HEALTH REHABILITATION IN THE WAR-AFFLICTED ZONES IN FACE OF FAILED CLINICAL TRIALS FOR VARIOUS DRUGS. THIS MAY HELP REDUCE THE RISK OF DEVELOPING DEMENTIA AND AD IN THIS SUSCEPTIBLE POPULATION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
19 2908  16 [PHYSICAL EXERCISE AND YOGA IN PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF ADDICTIVE DISEASES]. PREVENTION OF ADDICTIVE DISEASES SHOULD BE COMPLEX AND SYSTEMATIC AND IT SHOULD INCLUDE TRAINING OF SOCIAL SKILLS, DECISION-MAKING SKILLS, FAMILY INTERVENTION, ETC. SIMILARLY, EFFECTIVE TREATMENT IS USUALLY LONG-TERM, SYSTEMATIC AND COMPLEX. PHYSICAL EXERCISE AND YOGA CAN BE USEFUL COMPONENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT PROGRAMMES. ON THE OTHER HAND, COMPETITIVE PROFESSIONAL SPORT RATHER INCREASES THE NUMBER OF RISK FACTORS FOR SUBSTANCE-RELATED PROBLEMS. PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE USE OF YOGA IN SUBSTANCE DEPENDENT PATIENTS AND PATHOLOGICAL GAMBLES ARE MENTIONED.

20  237  32 A SYSTEMATIC SCOPING REVIEW OF YOGA INTERVENTION COMPONENTS AND STUDY QUALITY. CONTEXT: THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF YOGA REQUIRES RIGOROUS METHODOLOGY. THIS REVIEW AIMED TO SYSTEMATICALLY ASSESS ALL STUDIES OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS TO (1) DETERMINE YOGA INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS; (2) EXAMINE METHODOLOGIC QUALITY OF THE SUBSET OF RCTS; AND (3) EXPLORE HOW WELL THESE INTERVENTIONS ARE REPORTED. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: SEARCHES WERE CONDUCTED THROUGH APRIL 2012 IN PUBMED, PSYCINFO, AGELINE, AND OVID'S ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE DATABASE USING THE TEXT TERM YOGA, AND THROUGH HANDSEARCHING FIVE JOURNALS. ORIGINAL STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IF THE INTERVENTION (1) CONSISTED OF AT LEAST ONE YOGA SESSION WITH SOME TYPE OF HEALTH ASSESSMENT; (2) TARGETED ADULTS AGED >/=18 YEARS; (3) WAS PUBLISHED IN AN ENGLISH-LANGUAGE PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL; AND (4) WAS AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: OF 3,062 STUDIES IDENTIFIED, 465 STUDIES IN 30 COUNTRIES WERE INCLUDED. ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED THROUGH 2013. MOST INTERVENTIONS TOOK PLACE IN INDIA (N=228) OR THE U.S. (N=124), WITH INTENSITY RANGING FROM A SINGLE YOGA SESSION UP TO TWO SESSIONS PER DAY. INTERVENTION LENGTHS RANGED FROM ONE SESSION TO 2 YEARS. ASANAS (POSES) WERE MENTIONED AS YOGA COMPONENTS IN 369 (79%) INTERVENTIONS, BUT WERE EITHER MINIMALLY OR NOT AT ALL DESCRIBED IN 200 (54%) OF THESE. MOST INTERVENTIONS (74%, N=336) DID NOT INCLUDE HOME PRACTICE. OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES, 151 WERE RCTS. RCT QUALITY WAS RATED AS POOR. CONCLUSIONS: THIS REVIEW HIGHLIGHTS THE INADEQUATE REPORTING AND METHODOLOGIC LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT YOGA INTERVENTION RESEARCH, WHICH LIMITS STUDY INTERPRETATION AND COMPARABILITY. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE METHODOLOGY AND REPORTING ARE DISCUSSED.	2014

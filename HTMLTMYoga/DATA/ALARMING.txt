1  140 173 A PROSPECTIVE STUDY ON TYPE-2 DIABETIC COMPLICATIONS AND EFFICACY OF INTEGRATED YOGA: A PAN INDIA 2017. BACKGROUND: TYPE 2 DIABETES (T2DM) CONTRIBUTES TO HIGH MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY BECAUSE OF ITS MAJOR COMPLICATIONS RELATED TO KIDNEY, HEART, BRAIN, AND EYES. IT ALSO POSES A HIGH RISK FOR MORTALITY BECAUSE OF COVID-19. STUDIES SUGGEST THE POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS OF YOGA IN DELAYING OR ATTENUATING SUCH COMPLICATIONS. METHODOLOGY: THIS WAS A PAN-INDIA MULTI CENTERED CLUSTER-RANDOMIZED (4 LEVEL) TWO-ARMED TRIAL IN THE RURAL AND URBAN POPULATION OF ALL POPULOUS STATES OF INDIA. DATA WERE OBTAINED USING MOBILE APP IN ALL ADULTS IN THE HOUSEHOLD OF THE SELECTED CLUSTERS. RESULTS: WE REPORT THE DIABETES RELATED COMPLICATIONS IN 16623 ADULTS (48% MALES, 52% FEMALES) FROM 65 DISTRICTS (1 IN 10 DISTRICTS, 2011 CENSUS) OF 29 (OUT OF 35) STATES AND UNION TERRITORIES OF INDIA; MEAN AGE WAS 48.2 +/- 12.46 YEARS. OUT OF THIS 40% LIVED IN RURAL AND 62% IN URBAN LOCATIONS. IN HIGH RISK DIABETES INDIVIDUALS (SCORED >/= 60 POINTS ON INDIAN DIABETES RISK SCORE KEY), 18.0% HAD SELF-REPORTED HISTORY OF (PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY, 6.1% HAD H/O MAJOR STROKES, 5.5% HAD MINOR STROKES (TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC EPISODES), 18.1% HAD LOWER LIMB CLAUDICATION, 20.5% LEG ULCERS, 4.4% HAD H/O CARDIAC SURGERY, 4.8% ANGIOPLASTY, AND 15.1% HAD DIABETES RETINOPATHY. COMPLICATIONS WERE HIGHER IN RURAL THAN IN URBAN AREAS, HIGHER IN PEOPLE WITH EXTENDED DURATION OF DIABETES. INTEGRATED YOGA MODULE FOR THREE MONTHS (ONE HOUR DAILY) SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER REDUCTION IN SYMPTOMS RELATED TO COMPLICATIONS AS COMPARED TO CONTROL GROUP (P < .001). CONCLUSION: THE ALARMING HIGH PREVALENCE OF COMPLICATIONS IN DIABETES POPULATION CALLS FOR URGENT ACTION, WHERE YOGA MAY SHOW THE BENEFITS IN REDUCTION OF SYMPTOMS OF COMPLICATIONS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
2 2130  33 THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA TO PREVENT DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2: A PROTOCOL FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM) IS BECOMING A LEADING PROBLEM WORLDWIDE. EMERGING REPORTS REVEAL ALARMING EVIDENCE OF INCREASING PREVALENCE OF T2DM THAT HAS REACHED PANDEMIC LEVELS. DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT INCIDENCE, THERE ARE LIMITED RELIABLE DATA RESOURCES AND COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PEOPLE WHO ARE A PREDIABETIC OR HIGH RISK FOR DEVELOPING T2DM. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROTOCOL IS TO CONDUCT A FULL-SCALE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSES ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PEOPLE WHO ARE PREDIABETES OR HIGH RISK OF DEVELOPING T2DM. METHODS: THE ARTICLES ENROLLED IN THE STUDY WILL BE RETRIEVED FROM THE ONLINE DATABASES BETWEEN 2002 AND THE DATE THE SEARCHES ARE EXECUTED. THE SEARCHES WILL BE REPEATED JUST BEFORE THE FINAL ANALYSES AND FURTHER RELEVANT STUDIES FOR INCLUSION. WE WILL CONDUCT A BIBLIOGRAPHIC SEARCH IN DATABASES: MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, COCHRANE LIBRARY, EBSCO, AND INDMED USING KEYWORDS INCLUDING PREDIABETES STATE, HIGH RISK FOR DIABETES, METABOLIC SYNDROME, AND YOGA. A DEFINED SEARCH STRATEGY WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ALONG WITH SELECTION CRITERIA TO OBTAIN FULL-TEXT ARTICLES OF RELEVANT STUDIES. THIS STUDY PROTOCOL WAS PREPARED ACCORDING TO THE PREFERRED REPORTING ITEMS FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND META-ANALYSIS FOR PROTOCOLS 2015 GUIDELINES. THERE WILL BE NO LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL BE BASED ON PUBLISHED STUDIES AND PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ANONYMIZED DATA WITHOUT DIRECTLY INVOLVING HUMAN PARTICIPANTS AND THEREFORE REQUIRES NEITHER FORMAL HUMAN ETHICAL REVIEW NOR APPROVAL BY A HUMAN RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEE. WE PUBLISHED AN OUTLINE OF THE PROTOCOL IN THE INTERNATIONAL PROSPECTIVE REGISTER OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS (PROSPERO) IN 2018. WE PLAN TO DISSEMINATE THE FINDINGS OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS THROUGH PUBLICATION IN A PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL AND PRESENTATION AT RELEVANT CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS. IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE THE RESULTS OF THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WILL HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND PRACTICE. WE WILL PREPARE POLICYMAKER SUMMARY USING A VALIDATED FORMAT, DISSEMINATE THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA AND EMAIL DISCUSSION GROUPS.

3 1311  18 HEALTH IMPACTS OF YOGA AND PRANAYAMA: A STATE-OF-THE-ART REVIEW. THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO YOGA ORIGINATED IN INDIA, AND IN PRESENT DAY AND AGE, AN ALARMING AWARENESS WAS OBSERVED IN HEALTH AND NATURAL REMEDIES AMONG PEOPLE BY YOGA AND PRANAYAMA WHICH HAS BEEN PROVEN AN EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR IMPROVING HEALTH IN ADDITION TO PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF DISEASES. WITH INCREASING SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IN YOGA, ITS THERAPEUTIC ASPECTS ARE ALSO BEING EXPLORED. YOGA IS REPORTED TO REDUCE STRESS AND ANXIETY, IMPROVES AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS BY TRIGGERING NEUROHORMONAL MECHANISMS BY THE SUPPRESSION OF SYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY, AND EVEN, NOW-A-DAYS, SEVERAL REPORTS SUGGESTED YOGA IS BENEFICIAL FOR PHYSICAL HEALTH OF CANCER PATIENTS. SUCH GLOBAL RECOGNITION OF YOGA ALSO TESTIFIES TO INDIA'S GROWING CULTURAL INFLUENCE.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
4 1581  29 MECHANISM OF ACTION OF YOGA ON PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS: NARRATIVE REVIEW. BACKGROUND: RESEARCH IN INDIA HAS RECOGNIZED TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM) AND PREDIABETES (PDM) AS PSYCHOSOMATIC METABOLIC ENDOCRINE DISORDERS CHARACTERIZED BY GLYCEMIC DISHARMONY. THIS REVIEW AIMED AT COLLATING INFORMATION FROM PUBLISHED E-PAPERS ON MECHANISM OF ACTION (MOA) OF YOGA THERAPY(YT) AND INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY (IAYT) ON PDM AND T2DM. METHOD: CONTENT ON YT AND THE MOA ON PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF T2DM WERE EXTRACTED FROM ONLINE SOURCES SUCH AS PUBMED, GOOGLE SCHOLAR, COCHRANE LIBRARY AND LIBRARY GENESIS. THIS REVIEW INCLUDED 58 ARTICLES RELATED TO PREDIABETES, T2DM, PRE-DIABETES TO T2DM CONVERSION, MECHANISM OF ACTION OF YOGA, YOGA AND T2DM, PREDIABETES AND YOGA. ARTICLES RELATED TO TYPE 1 DIABETES, DIABETES INSIPIDUS AND GESTATIONAL DIABETES WERE EXCLUDED. RESULT: CURRENT SCIENTIFIC REVIEW RESULTED IN UNDERSTANDING THE DIFFERENT MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN REJUVENATING EFFECT OF YOGA AS YT AND IAYT IN PREDIABETES AND T2DM. HOWEVER, THE VARIOUS MECHANISMS BY WHICH THE INTERVENTIONS WORK ARE UNDERSTOOD EITHER THROUGH A SINGLE OR COMBINED IMPACT ON REGAINING AUTONOMIC BALANCE, VAGAL MODULATION, REGULATION OF HORMONES AND THEREBY ATTAINING GLYCEMIC CONTROL. MOREOVER, THESE MECHANISMS ARE THE FORTHCOMINGS OF THE CROSS TALK BETWEEN BRAIN, MIND AND BODY SYSTEMS UNDER BRANCHES OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGY, NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY, PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGY, PSYCHO NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY AND/OR NEUROPSYCHOLOGY. CONCLUSION: EVIDENCE SOUGHT FROM PUBLISHED RESEARCH WORKS PROCLAIM YT BASED LIFE STYLE MODIFICATION FOR PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF T2DM. SUMMING UP, THE EFFECT IS STIPULATED BASED ON THE APPROACH, METHOD OF PRACTICE, TIME OF THE DAY, BELIEF AND DEDICATION OF THE PRACTITIONERS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
5 1803  55 PREVALENCE OF DIABETES AND ITS DETERMINANTS IN THE YOUNG ADULTS INDIAN POPULATION-CALL FOR YOGA INTERVENTION. BACKGROUND: THE YOUNG INDIAN POPULATION, WHICH CONSTITUTES 65% OF THE COUNTRY, IS FAST ADAPTING TO A NEW LIFESTYLE, WHICH WAS NOT KNOWN EARLIER. THEY ARE AT A HIGH RISK OF THE INCREASING BURDEN OF DIABETES AND ASSOCIATED COMPLICATIONS. THE NEW EVOLVING LIFESTYLE IS NOT ONLY AFFECTING PEOPLE'S HEALTH BUT ALSO MOUNTING THE MONETARY BURDEN ON A DEVELOPING COUNTRY SUCH AS INDIA. AIM: WE AIMED TO COLLECT INFORMATION REGARDING THE PREVALENCE OF RISK OF DIABETES IN YOUNG ADULTS (<35 YEARS) IN THE 29 MOST POPULOUS STATES AND UNION TERRITORIES (7 ZONES) OF INDIA, USING A VALIDATED QUESTIONNAIRE. METHODS: A USER-FRIENDLY QUESTIONNAIRE-BASED SURVEY USING A MOBILE APPLICATION WAS CONDUCTED ON ALL ADULTS IN THE 29 MOST POPULOUS STATES/UNION TERRITORIES OF INDIA, AFTER OBTAINING ETHICAL CLEARANCE FOR THE STUDY. HERE, WE REPORT THE ESTIMATION OF THE PREVALENCE OF THE RISK OF DIABETES AND SELF-REPORTED DIABETES ON 58,821 YOUNG INDIVIDUALS BELOW THE AGE OF 35 YEARS. RISK FOR DIABETES WAS ASSESSED USING A STANDARDIZED INSTRUMENT, THE INDIAN DIABETES RISK SCORE (IDRS), THAT HAS 4 FACTORS (AGE, FAMILY HISTORY OF DIABETES, WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE, AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY). SPEARMAN'S CORRELATION COEFFICIENT WAS USED TO CHECK THE CORRELATIONS. RESULTS: THE PREVALENCE OF HIGH (IDRS SCORE > 60), MODERATE (IDRS SCORE 30-50), AND LOW (IDRS < 30) DIABETES RISK IN YOUNG ADULTS (<35 YEARS) WAS 10.2%, 33.1%, AND 56.7%, RESPECTIVELY. THOSE WITH HIGH-RISK SCORES WERE HIGHEST (14.4%) IN THE JAMMU ZONE AND LOWEST (4.1%) IN THE CENTRAL ZONE. THE PREVALENCE OF SELF-REPORTED DIABETES WAS 1.8% WITH A SMALL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEN (1.7%) AND WOMEN (1.9%), AND THE HIGHEST (8.4%) IN THOSE WITH A PARENTAL HISTORY OF DIABETES. THE SOUTH ZONE HAD THE HIGHEST (2.5%), AND THE NORTH WEST ZONE HAD THE LOWEST (4.4%) PREVALENCE. CONCLUSIONS: INDIAN YOUTH ARE AT HIGH RISK FOR DIABETES, WHICH CALLS FOR AN URGENT ACTION PLAN THROUGH INTENSIVE EFFORTS TO PROMOTE LIFESTYLE BEHAVIOR MODIFICATIONS DURING THE PANDEMICS OF BOTH COMMUNICABLE AND NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES.	2020

TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM) IS ONE OF THE MAJOR HEALTH PROBLEMS IN THE WORLD AS WELL AS IN INDIA THAT GREATLY AFFECTS THE HEALTH CARE SECTOR AND ECONOMY. USE OF DRUGS HAS ITS OWN DRAWBACKS AND IN RECENT DAYS THE USE OF NON-MEDICAL MEASURES WERE REPORTED NOT ONLY TO MANAGE T2DM, BUT ALSO TO PREVENT ITS COMPLICATIONS. THROUGH THERE ARE VARIOUS REVIEW ARTICLES THAT ARE DEALING WITH THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON RISK PROFILES, MANAGEMENT ALONG WITH THE MECHANISMS OF ACTION OF YOGA IN T2DM SEPARATELY, THERE IS A LACK OF COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW ON THE EFFECT OF YOGA IN COMBINATION WITH ALL THE ABOVE MENTIONED INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF T2DM COMPLICATIONS. HENCE, WE PERFORMED A NARRATIVE REVIEW IN MEDLINE/PUBMED USING KEYWORD "YOGA AND DIABETES". ALL THE RELEVANT ARTICLES PUBLISHED TILL 08TH NOVEMBER 2016 WERE INCLUDED. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE LITERATURE, IT COULD BE CONCLUDED THAT YOGA PLAYS A VITAL ROLE AS AN ADJUVANT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF RISK FACTORS, DISEASE PROGRESSION AND THE COMPLICATIONS OF THE T2DM. FURTHER STUDIES ARE WARRANTED USING STANDARD RESEARCH DESIGNS AND VARIABLES TO FIND OUT THE VARIOUS MECHANISMS OF EFFECTS OF YOGA IN DETAIL.	2017

THIS STUDY SHOWED A WIDE VARIETY OF JOURNALS IN WHICH YOGA-DIABETIC ARTICLES ARE PUBLISHED; THESE BIBLIOMETRIC INDICATORS PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION ON PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT OF PRODUCTIVITY AND QUALITY OF RESEARCH OUTPUT. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY PROVIDES A HELPFUL REFERENCE FOR ENDOCRINOLOGISTS, YOGA THERAPISTS, POLICY DECISION-MAKERS, AND DIABETES RESEARCHERS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
9  921  33 EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AS THE PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION MODULE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES AND DIABETES ASSOCIATED DEMENTIA IN SOUTH EAST ASIA: A NARRATIVE REVIEW. BACKGROUND: DIABETES MELLITUS (DM) IS WIDELY SPREAD IN SOUTH ASIAN (ASEAN) AND INDIAN SUB-CONTINENT. THE INCREASING HEALTHCARE COSTS OF DM CAN BE PREVENTED IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD BY IMPROVED PUBLIC HEALTHCARE INTERVENTIONS. MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS OF DM LIKE SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE, OBESITY, AND STRESSFUL CONDITIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ITS PROGRESSION; HOWEVER, THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA COLLECTED BY PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS ARE LIMITED. SUMMARY: A REVIEW OF PUBLISHED LITERATURE DESCRIBING GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF DM AND ASSOCIATED DEMENTIA IN SOUTH ASIAN REGION, PARTICULARLY INDIA, WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE PURPOSE OF ASSESSING THE FEASIBILITY AND CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE YOGA-BASED RISK REDUCTION. PUBMED AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR DM AND DEMENTIA-RELATED ARTICLES BY USING A COMBINATION OF KEYWORDS: DIABETES, DIABETES RELATED DEMENTIA SOUTHEAST ASIA, PRE-DIABETES, YOGA, LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION, DEMENTIA AND EXERCISE. THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA GENERATED FROM THESE DISEASES HAVE NOT PROMPTED TO ANY MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH POLICIES. YOGA CAN BE A COST-EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR THE PREVENTION OF TYPE 2 DM (T2DM) AND ITS ASSOCIATED COGNITIVE DECLINE WHEN DETECTED EARLY. IF NATIONWIDE INTERVENTION OF YOGA IS BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE STATE, ITS INTEGRATION IN HEALTH CARE WILL BECOME MORE MEANINGFUL AND ACCEPTABLE. KEY MESSAGE: STUDIES SUGGEST THAT YOGA AND CHANGE IN LIFESTYLE CAN MODIFY THE HEALTH RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH T2DM AND ASSOCIATED DEMENTIA IF IT IS MAINSTREAMED WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH INITIATIVE OF AYUSHMAN BHARAT SCHEME.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
10 2171  31 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS AMONG PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM) IS A FASTEST EVOLVING METABOLIC DISORDER AND INDIA HOUSES SECOND HIGHEST NUMBER OF PATIENTS WITH DIABETES AFTER CHINA. CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES ARE THE MAJOR CAUSE OF MORTALITY AMONG PATIENTS WITH T2DM. YOGA IS AN ANCIENT INDIAN PRACTICE THAT PROVES TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR PATIENTS WITH DIABETES. THE PRESENT SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS HAS BEEN CONDUCTED TO SEE THE BENEFITS OF YOGA ON BLOOD PRESSURE, LIPID PROFILE, AND ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASURES AMONG PATIENTS WITH T2DM. THE ARTICLES WERE EXTRACTED FROM THREE DATABASES - PUBMED, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR. ONLY ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTICLES, WITH PEDRO SCORE>/=6, WERE INCLUDED IN THE CURRENT STUDY. THE DUPLICATES WERE REMOVED USING MENDELEY. FOURTEEN RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) AND THREE 3 NON-RCTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. THE META-ANALYSIS WAS DONE USING REVIEW MANAGER 5.3. THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT YOGA IS EFFECT IN IMPROVING BLOOD PRESSURE (P<0.01), LIPID PROFILE (P<0.01) EXCEPT HDL (P=0.06), AND ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASURES (P<0.01) EXCEPT WAIST-HIP RATIO (P=0.79). HETEROGENEITY WAS ALSO HIGH FOR MOST OF THE VARIABLES. IT MAY BE CONCLUDED FROM THE RESULTS THAT THE YOGA IS EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING OF BLOOD PRESSURE, LIPID PROFILE, AND ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASURES. HOWEVER, HIGH HETEROGENEITY SOUGHT THE NEED OF MORE HIGH QUALITY RCTS TO AFFIRM THESE FINDINGS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
11 2298  24 THERAPEUTIC ROLE OF YOGA IN TYPE 2 DIABETES. YOGA ORIGINATED IN INDIA MORE THAN 5,000 YEARS AGO AND IS A MEANS OF BALANCING AND HARMONIZING THE BODY, MIND, AND EMOTIONS. YOGA PRACTICE IS USEFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF VARIOUS LIFESTYLE DISEASES, INCLUDING TYPE 2 DIABETES.

12 2013  26 SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA: A BREATH OF HOPE DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC. IMPORTANT COUNTER MEASURES TO COMBAT AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE PANDEMIC INCLUDE VACCINATION, ANTIVIRAL THERAPY, AND IMMUNOMODULATION THERAPY. VACCINATIONS ARE DISEASE SPECIFIC AND MOREOVER STRAIN SPECIFIC, SO THE PROTECTION PROVIDED IS ALSO SPECIFIC AND LIMITED. ANTIVIRAL THERAPIES ARE COSTLY AND REQUIRE BULK PRODUCTION OF DRUGS, HENCE GLOBALLY THERE IS AN INCREASED INTEREST TOWARD LOW-RISK, COST-EFFECTIVE COMPLEMENTARY ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, SUCH AS YOGA AND AYURVEDA TO TACKLE THE INFECTIOUS PANDEMIC, CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19). THERE IS CLINICAL EVIDENCE AVAILABLE ON THE POTENTIAL COMPLEMENTARY ROLE OF YOGIC PRACTICES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF NONCOMMUNICABLE AND COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. VARIOUS ONLINE DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR ARTICLES PUBLISHED BETWEEN 2000 AND 2020. DATABASES EXPLORED WERE MEDLINE, EMBASE, INDIAN CITATION INDEX, PSYCINFO, INDEX MEDICUS FOR SOUTH-EAST ASIA REGION, AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR. ALL SEARCH RESULTS WERE SCREENED, AND ARTICLES RELATED TO KEYWORDS SUCH AS COVID-19, YOGA THERAPY, AND SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA (SKY) WERE SELECTED FOR DATA EXTRACTION. QUALITY OF THE STUDIES INCLUDED WAS EVALUATED ON THE BASIS OF THE CONSTRUCT VALIDITY, CONTENT VALIDITY, RELEVANCE, BIAS, CREDIBILITY RELATING TO INFORMATION, AND DATA SOURCES. SKY IS A UNIQUE YOGIC PRACTICE THAT INCLUDES SPECIFIC SEQUENTIAL BREATHING TECHNIQUES. IT BALANCES THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THUS CAN ALLEVIATE ANXIETY, ROUTINE STRESS, DEPRESSION, STRESS-RELATED MEDICAL DISORDERS, AND POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS. IT POTENTIATES NATURAL HOST IMMUNE DEFENSES THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO TACKLE A PLETHORA OF MICROBIAL INFECTIONS. THIS NARRATIVE REVIEW ARTICLE PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS THAT SKY CAN OFFER TO THE POPULATION AT LARGE DURING THIS COVID-19 PANDEMIC.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
13 2118  36 THE EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICE ON GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND OTHER HEALTH PARAMETERS IN THE PREDIABETIC STATE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON GLYCEMIC CONTROL, LIPID PROFILES, BODY COMPOSITION AND BLOOD PRESSURE IN PEOPLE IN THE PRE-DIABETIC STATE. STUDIES ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA ON POPULATION GROUPS UNDER HIGH RISK FOR DIABETES, CALLED PREDIABETIC OR SUFFERING FROM METABOLIC SYNDROMES WERE EXTRACTED FROM A THOROUGH SEARCH OF PUBMED, SCOPUS, COCHRANE LIBRARY, EBSCO AND INDMED DATABASES. BOTH RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) AND NON-RCT STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IN THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. STUDIES PUBLISHED BETWEEN JAN 2002 AND DEC 2018 WERE INCLUDED. STUDIES WERE CONSIDERED FOR EVALUATION IF THEY INVESTIGATED A YOGA INTERVENTION TO PREVENT T2DM, AGAINST A CONTROL GROUP, WHILE ALSO REPORTING GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND OTHER HEALTH PARAMETERS OF T2DM MANAGEMENT. SUMMARY EFFECT SIZES AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CI) WERE CALCULATED USING THE COMPREHENSIVE META-ANALYSIS SOFTWARE IN ADDITION TO PUBLICATION BIAS. OF THE 46,500 IDENTIFIED STUDIES, 14 STUDIES WITH 834 PARTICIPANTS OF WHOM WERE 50% WOMEN, WERE FOUND TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION IN OUR SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OUR QUANTITATIVE SYNTHESIS INCLUDED 12 RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS AND 2 NON-RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS, WITH THE FOLLOW-UP PERIOD RANGING FROM 4 TO 52 WEEKS. COMPARED TO CONTROLS, YOGA INTERVENTION IMPROVED FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE (FBG) [STANDARD MEAN DIFFERENCE (SMD -0.064 MG/DL (95% CI -0.201 TO 0.074)]; LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (LDL) [SMD-0.090 MG/DL (95% CI -0.270 TO 0.090)]; TRIGLYCERIDES [SMD -0.148 MG/DL (95% CI -0.285 TO -0.012)]; TOTAL CHOLESTEROL [SMD -0.058 MG/DL (95% CI -0.220 TO 0.104)] AND SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE [SMD -0.058 MM HG (95% CI -0.168 TO 0.053)]. THIS META-ANALYSIS UNCOVERED CLINICALLY IMPROVED EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON GLYCEMIC CONTROL, LIPID PROFILES AND OTHER PARAMETERS OF T2DM MANAGEMENT IN PREDIABETIC POPULATION. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA INTERVENTION MAY BE CONSIDERED AS A COMPREHENSIVE AND ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO PREVENTING T2DM. FURTHER ADEQUATELY POWERED, WELL DESIGNED RCTS ARE NEEDED TO SUPPORT OUR FINDINGS AND INVESTIGATE THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA IN T2DM PATIENTS.	2019

15 1824  33 PSYCHO-NEURO-ENDOCRINE-IMMUNE MECHANISMS OF ACTION OF YOGA IN TYPE II DIABETES. YOGA HAS BEEN FOUND TO BENEFIT ALL THE COMPONENTS OF HEALTH VIZ. PHYSICAL, MENTAL, SOCIAL AND SPIRITUAL WELL BEING BY INCORPORATING A WIDE VARIETY OF PRACTICES. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF TYPE II DM AND CO-MORBIDITIES IN TYPE II DM HAS BEEN CORRELATED WITH STRESS MECHANISMS. STRESS SUPPRESSES BODY'S IMMUNE SYSTEM AND NEURO-HUMORAL ACTIONS THEREBY AFF ECTING NORMAL PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE. IT WOULD NOT BE WRONG TO STATE THAT CORRELATION OF DIABETES WITH STRESS, ANXIETY AND OTHER PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS ARE BIDIRECTIONAL AND LEAD TO DIFFICULTY IN UNDERSTANDING THE INTERRELATED MECHANISMS. TYPE II DM CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD IN ISOLATION WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS SUCH AS STRESS, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, NEURO-ENDOCRINE AND IMMUNOLOGICAL FACTORS. THERE IS NO REVIEW WHICH TRIES TO UNDERSTAND THESE MECHANISMS EXCLUSIVELY. THE PRESENT LITERATURE REVIEW AIMS TO UNDERSTAND INTERRELATED PSYCHO-NEURO-ENDOCRINE AND IMMUNOLOGICAL MECHANISMS OF ACTION OF YOGA IN TYPE II DIABETES MELLITUS. PUBLISHED LITERATURE CONCERNING MECHANISMS OF ACTION OF YOGA IN TYPE II DM EMPHASIZING PSYCHO-NEURO-ENDOCRINE OR IMMUNOLOGICAL RELATIONS WAS RETRIEVED FROM PUBMED USING KEY WORDS YOGA, TYPE II DIABETES MELLITUS, PSYCHOLOGICAL, NEURAL, ENDOCRINE, IMMUNE AND MECHANISM OF ACTION. THOSE STUDIES WHICH EXPLAINED THE PSYCHO-NEUROENDOCRINE AND IMMUNE MECHANISMS OF ACTION OF YOGA WERE INCLUDED AND REST WERE EXCLUDED. ALTHOUGH PRIMARY AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXPLAIN THESE MECHANISMS IN TYPE II DM, SOME STUDIES IN NON-DIABETIC POPULATION WHICH HAD A SIMILAR PATHWAY OF STRESS MECHANISM WAS INCLUDED BECAUSE MANY INSIGHTFUL STUDIES WERE AVAILABLE IN THAT AREA. SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED USING TERMS YOGA OR YOGIC AND DIABETES OR DIABETIC IN TITLE OR ABSTRACT FOR ENGLISH ARTICLES. OF THE 89 ARTICLES, WE EXCLUDED NON-ENGLISH ARTICLES (22), EDITORIALS (20) AND LETTERS TO EDITOR (10). 37 STUDIES WERE CONSIDERED FOR THIS REVIEW. THE POSTULATED MECHANISM OF ACTION OF YOGA IS THROUGH PARASYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION AND THE ASSOCIATED ANTI STRESS MECHANISM. IT REDUCES PERCEIVED STRESS AND HPA AXIS ACTIVATION THEREBY IMPROVING OVERALL METABOLIC AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILES, INCREASING INSULIN SENSITIVITY, AND IMPROVING GLUCOSE TOLERANCE AND LIPID METABOLISM. YOGA HAS POSITIVE EFFECTS ON IMMUNE SYSTEM OF DIABETICS.- OVERALL, TYPE II DM IS INFLUENCED BY PSYCHO-NEURO-ENDOCRINE AND IMMUNE MECHANISMS WHERE YOGA HAS IMPORTANT POSITIVE ROLE IN COMBATING STRESSORS AND IMPROVING THESE SYSTEMS TO REGAIN HEALTH.	2015	

16 2465  33 YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION: A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF PUBLISHED RESEARCH STUDIES FROM 1967 TO 2013. OBJECTIVE: A COMPREHENSIVE BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED ON PUBLICATIONS FOR YOGA THERAPY RESEARCH IN CLINICAL POPULATIONS. METHODS: MAJOR ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR ARTICLES IN ALL LANGUAGES PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1967 AND 2013. DATABASES INCLUDED PUBMED, PSYCHINFO, MEDLINE, INDMED, INDIAN CITATION INDEX, INDEX MEDICUS FOR SOUTH-EAST ASIA REGION, WEB OF KNOWLEDGE, EMBASE, EBSCO, AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR. NONINDEXED JOURNALS WERE SEARCHED MANUALLY. KEY SEARCH WORDS INCLUDED YOGA, YOGA THERAPY, PRANAYAMA, ASANA. ALL STUDIES MET THE DEFINITION OF A CLINICAL TRIAL. ALL STYLES OF YOGA WERE INCLUDED. THE AUTHORS EXTRACTED THE DATA. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 486 ARTICLES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA AND WERE PUBLISHED IN 217 DIFFERENT PEER-REVIEWED JOURNALS FROM 29 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES ON 28,080 STUDY PARTICIPANTS. THE PRIMARY RESULT OBSERVED IS THE THREE-FOLD INCREASE IN NUMBER OF PUBLICATIONS SEEN IN THE LAST 10 YEARS, INCLUSIVE OF ALL STUDY DESIGNS. OVERALL, 45% OF THE STUDIES PUBLISHED WERE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS, 18% WERE CONTROLLED STUDIES, AND 37% WERE UNCONTROLLED STUDIES. MOST PUBLICATIONS ORIGINATED FROM INDIA (N=258), FOLLOWED BY THE UNITED STATES (N=122) AND CANADA (N=13). THE TOP THREE DISORDERS ADDRESSED BY YOGA INTERVENTIONS WERE MENTAL HEALTH, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, AND RESPIRATORY DISEASE. CONCLUSION: A SURGE IN PUBLICATIONS ON YOGA TO MITIGATE DISEASE-RELATED SYMPTOMS IN CLINICAL POPULATIONS HAS OCCURRED DESPITE CHALLENGES FACING THE FIELD OF YOGA RESEARCH, WHICH INCLUDE STANDARDIZATION AND LIMITATIONS IN FUNDING, TIME, AND RESOURCES. THE POPULATION AT LARGE HAS OBSERVED A PARALLEL SURGE IN THE USE OF YOGA OUTSIDE OF CLINICAL PRACTICE. THE USE OF YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY IN CLINICAL PRACTICE MAY LEAD TO HEALTH BENEFITS BEYOND TRADITIONAL TREATMENT ALONE; HOWEVER, TO EFFECT CHANGES IN HEALTH CARE POLICY, MORE HIGH-QUALITY, EVIDENCE-BASED RESEARCH IS NEEDED.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
17 1569  16 MALE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH AND YOGA. NOW-A-DAYS REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH PROBLEMS ALONG WITH INFERTILITY IN MALE IS VERY OFTEN OBSERVED. VARIOUS ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM, BUT COMMON PEOPLE CANNOT AFFORD THE COST OF SUCH PROCEDURES.

18  613  29 DEVELOPMENT OF A YOGA PROGRAM FOR TYPE-2 DIABETES PREVENTION (YOGA-DP) AMONG HIGH-RISK PEOPLE IN INDIA. INTRODUCTION: MANY INDIANS ARE AT HIGH-RISK OF TYPE-2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM). YOGA IS AN ANCIENT INDIAN MIND-BODY DISCIPLINE, THAT HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED GLUCOSE LEVELS AND CAN HELP TO PREVENT T2DM. THE STUDY AIMED TO SYSTEMATICALLY DEVELOP A YOGA PROGRAM FOR T2DM PREVENTION (YOGA-DP) AMONG HIGH-RISK PEOPLE IN INDIA USING A COMPLEX INTERVENTION DEVELOPMENT APPROACH. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AS PART OF THE INTERVENTION, WE DEVELOPED A BOOKLET AND A HIGH-DEFINITION VIDEO FOR PARTICIPANTS AND A MANUAL FOR YOGA-DP INSTRUCTORS. A SYSTEMATIC ITERATIVE PROCESS WAS FOLLOWED TO DEVELOP THE INTERVENTION AND INCLUDED FIVE STEPS: (I) A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE TO GENERATE A LIST OF YOGIC PRACTICES THAT IMPROVES BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS AMONG ADULTS AT HIGH-RISK OF OR WITH T2DM, (II) VALIDATION OF IDENTIFIED YOGIC PRACTICES BY YOGA EXPERTS, (III) DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTERVENTION, (IV) CONSULTATION WITH YOGA, EXERCISE, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, DIET, BEHAVIOR CHANGE, AND/OR DIABETES EXPERTS ABOUT THE INTERVENTION, AND (V) PRETEST THE INTERVENTION AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND LAY PEOPLE (THOSE AT RISK OF T2DM AND HAD NOT PRACTICED YOGA BEFORE) IN INDIA. RESULTS: YOGA-DP IS A STRUCTURED LIFESTYLE EDUCATION AND EXERCISE PROGRAM, PROVIDED OVER A PERIOD OF 24 WEEKS. THE EXERCISE PART IS BASED ON YOGA AND INCLUDES SHITHILIKARANA VYAYAMA (LOOSENING EXERCISES), SURYA NAMASKAR (SUN SALUTATION EXERCISES), ASANA (YOGIC POSES), PRANAYAMA (BREATHING PRACTICES), AND DHYANA (MEDITATION) AND RELAXATION PRACTICES. ONCE PARTICIPANTS COMPLETE THE PROGRAM, THEY ARE STRONGLY ENCOURAGED TO MAINTAIN A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE IN THE LONG-TERM. CONCLUSIONS: WE SYSTEMATICALLY DEVELOPED A NOVEL YOGA PROGRAM FOR T2DM PREVENTION (YOGA-DP) AMONG HIGH-RISK PEOPLE IN INDIA. A MULTI-CENTER FEASIBILITY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IS IN PROGRESS IN INDIA.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
19 1911  20 ROLE OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE IN THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC - A NARRATIVE REVIEW. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS POSED AN IMMENSE CHALLENGE TO HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AROUND THE GLOBE IN TERMS OF LIMITED HEALTH CARE FACILITIES AND PROVEN MEDICAL THERAPEUTICS TO ADDRESS THE SYMPTOMS OF THE INFECTION. THE CURRENT HEALTH CARE STRATEGIES ARE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON EITHER THE PATHOGEN OR THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. HOWEVER, EFFORTS TOWARDS STRENGTHENING THE HOST IMMUNITY ARE IMPORTANT FROM PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF INFECTION AND DOWNREGULATE THE POTENCY OF THE INFECTIOUS AGENT. WHILE A VACCINE CAN INDUCE SPECIFIC IMMUNITY IN THE HOST, NON-SPECIFIC WAYS OF IMPROVING OVERALL HOST IMMUNITY ARE NEEDED AS WELL. THIS SCENARIO HAS PAVED THE WAY FOR THE USE OF TRADITIONAL INDIAN THERAPIES SUCH AS AYURVEDA AND YOGA. THIS REVIEW AIMS AT COLLATING AVAILABLE EVIDENCE ON AYURVEDA, YOGA, AND COVID-19. FURTHER, IT DRAWS INFERENCES FROM RECENT STUDIES ON YOGA AND AYURVEDA ON IMMUNITY, RESPIRATORY HEALTH, AND MENTAL HEALTH RESPECTIVELY TO APPROXIMATE ITS PROBABLE ROLE IN PROPHYLAXIS AND AS AN ADD-ON MANAGEMENT OPTION FOR THE CURRENT PANDEMIC.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
20  495  24 COMBATING THE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC THROUGH YOGA: RECOMMENDATION FROM AN OVERVIEW. GLOBALLY, THE PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH OF THE PEOPLE IS BEING AFFECTED DUE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. GIVEN THE FACT THAT NUMEROUS SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS ALREADY EXIST ON YOGA AND MENTAL HEALTH, IT BECOMES VITAL TO UNDERTAKE AN OVERVIEW ON THE SAME. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE OVERVIEW WAS TO SUMMARISE THE EVIDENCE FROM DIFFERENT SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF DISTINCT YOGA INTERVENTIONS USED TO IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH AND RECOMMEND YOGA PRACTICES FOR THE SAME. THE PROTOCOL WAS REGISTERED ON PROSPERO (CRD42020185221). MEDLINE VIA PUBMED, COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR WERE SEARCHED FOR RELEVANT LITERATURE. SEARCH TERMS USED WERE "YOGA PRACTICE, MENTAL HEALTH AND SYSTEMATIC REVIEW". REVIEWS FROM EARLIEST POSSIBLE DATE TILL MAY 2020, INCLUDING THOSE EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF ANY SINGLE OR COMBINATION OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON MENTAL HEALTH REPORTED ON CHILDREN, YOUTH AND ADULTS WERE SELECTED. THE ASSESSMENT OF MULTIPLE SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS (AMSTAR) TOOL WAS USED TO EVALUATE THE EVIDENCE OF THE INCLUDED REVIEWS. OUT OF THE 90 REVIEWS FOUND, EIGHT UNIQUE REVIEWS WERE SELECTED FOR THE OVERVIEW. OVERALL, 243 STUDIES WERE ANALYZED, WITH AN OVERLAP OF ONLY 6 STUDIES ACROSS THE REVIEWS. OUT OF 8 REVIEWS, ONLY 2 WERE OF HIGH QUALITY AND THE REST WERE OF MODERATE QUALITY. OWING TO HETEROGENEITY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES, ONLY DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS WAS POSSIBLE. THE RESULTS OF THE REVIEW INDICATE MODERATE TO POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON THE MENTAL HEALTH PARAMETERS. PRACTICING YOGA (PHYSICAL POSTURES, BHRAMARY PRANAYAM, MINDFULNESS MEDITATION, SAHAJ YOGA AND LAUGHTER THERAPY) CAN BE BENEFICIAL TO IMPROVE PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH OF THE PEOPLE DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.	2021

1 2098 138 THE EFFECT OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. BACKGROUND: WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER (BC) ARE LIVING LONGER WITH DEBILITATING SIDE EFFECTS SUCH AS CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (CRF) THAT AFFECT OVERALL WELL-BEING. YOGA PROMOTES HEALTH, WELL-BEING AND MAY BE BENEFICIAL IN REDUCING CRF. ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN PREVIOUS SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND META-ANALYSES, THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CRF AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) REMAIN UNCLEAR, PARTICULARLY IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER TYPES OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (PA). OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO CARRY OUT A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CRF AND QOL IN WOMEN WITH BC. METHODS: ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE SEARCHED (MEDLINE, EMBASE CLASSIC+EMBASE AND EMB REVIEWS, COCHRANE CENTRAL CT) FROM INCEPTION TO MAY 2018. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE INCLUDED IF THEY WERE FULL TEXT, IN ENGLISH, INCLUDED A YOGA INTERVENTION, A COMPARATOR (INCLUDING NON-PA USUAL CARE OR ALTERNATE PA INTERVENTION), AND REPORTED ON CRF OR QOL. EFFECTS OF YOGA WERE POOLED USING STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE (SMD) VIA A RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL. RESULTS: OF THE 2468 RECORDS RETRIEVED, 24 TRIALS WERE INCLUDED; 18 STUDIES COMPARED YOGA TO A NON-PA COMPARATOR AND 6 TO A PA COMPARATOR. YOGA DEMONSTRATED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN CRF OVER NON-PA (SMD -0.30 [-0.51; -0.08]) BUT NOT PA (SMD -0.17 [-0.50; 0.17]) COMPARATORS. ADDITIONALLY, YOGA DEMONSTRATED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN QOL OVER NON-PA (SMD -0.27 [-0.46; -0.07]) BUT NOT PA (SMD 0.04 [-0.22; +0.31]) COMPARATORS. DISCUSSION: THIS META-ANALYSIS FOUND THAT YOGA PROVIDES SMALL TO MEDIUM IMPROVEMENTS IN CRF AND QOL COMPARED TO NON-PA, BUT NOT IN COMPARISON TO OTHER PA INTERVENTIONS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
2 2647  48 YOGA HAS A SOLID EFFECT ON CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER: A META-ANALYSIS. PURPOSE: THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO CRITICALLY EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. METHODS: EIGHT DATABASES (COCHRANE LIBRARY, PUBMED, OVID-MEDLINE, WEB OF SCIENCE, CBM, WANFANG, VIP, AND CNKI) WERE SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEWED FROM INCEPTION TO JANUARY 2019 FOR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS). TWO REVIEWERS CRITICALLY AND INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSED THE RISK OF BIAS USING COCHRANE COLLABORATION CRITERIA AND EXTRACTED CORRELATED DATA USING THE DESIGNED FORM. ALL ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED WITH REVIEW MANAGER 5.3. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 17 QUALIFIED STUDIES THAT INCLUDED 2183 PATIENTS (YOGA: 1112, CONTROL: 1071) WERE INCLUDED IN THE META-ANALYSIS. YOGA HAD A LARGE EFFECT ON FATIGUE IN POST-TREATMENT BREAST CANCER PATIENTS AND HAD A SMALL EFFECT ON INTRA-TREATMENT PATIENTS. THE META-ANALYSIS ALSO INDICATED THAT SUPERVISED YOGA CLASS HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON CRF; THE SIX-WEEK PROGRAM HAD A MODERATE BENEFICIAL EFFECT WHILE THE 60/90 MIN/SESSION SUPERVISED YOGA CLASS AND THE EIGHT-WEEK PROGRAM DEMONSTRATED A LARGE EFFECT ON FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. YOGA COULD MARKEDLY MITIGATE THE PHYSICAL FATIGUE IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS, HAD A MEDIUM IMPACT ON COGNITIVE FATIGUE, AND MANIFESTED A SMALL EFFECT ON MENTAL FATIGUE. EIGHT STUDIES REPORTED THE ADVERSE EVENTS, WHEREAS TEN STUDIES DID NOT. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA CAN BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE THERAPY FOR RELIEVING FATIGUE IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WHO HAVE COMPLETED TREATMENT OR ARE UNDERGOING ANTI-CANCER TREATMENT.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
3 1065  49 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER: A META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. BACKGROUND: COMPLICATIONS OF BREAST CANCER TREATMENT CAN CAUSE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL DISTRESS IN PATIENTS. YOGA DEMONSTRATES SUBSTANTIAL POTENTIAL AS A SUPPORTIVE THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. OUR AIM IS TO CONDUCT A META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN ENHANCING THE QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) OF PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. METHODS: WE SEARCHED FOR STUDIES PUBLISHED BEFORE MARCH 2020 IN THE PUBMED, EMBASE, AND COCHRANE LIBRARY DATABASES. INDIVIDUAL EFFECT SIZES WERE STANDARDIZED, AND THE POOLED EFFECT SIZE WAS CALCULATED USING A RANDOM EFFECT MODEL. MEASURED OUTCOMES INCLUDED QOL, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, STRESS, FATIGUE, PAIN SEVERITY, AND SLEEP QUALITY. RESULTS: IN TOTAL, 26 TRIALS INVOLVING 2069 PATIENTS WERE REVIEWED. SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENT IN QOL WAS OBSERVED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE YOGA INTERVENTION. THE POOLED MEAN DIFFERENCES IN SOCIAL (WEIGHTED MEAN DIFFERENCE [WMD]: 1.36, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI] 0.12-2.61), EMOTIONAL (WMD: 1.46, 95% CI 0.26-2.66), AND FUNCTIONAL WELL-BEING (WMD: 2.04, 95% CI 0.21-3.87) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN THE YOGA GROUP THAN IN THE CONTROL GROUP. PATIENTS PRACTICING YOGA EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN PHYSICAL WELL-BEING, MENTAL WELL-BEING, AND SLEEP QUALITY AS WELL AS REDUCTIONS IN ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, STRESS, FATIGUE, AND PAIN SEVERITY AFTER THE INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA MAY ENHANCE QOL IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER EXPERIENCING POST-TREATMENT COMPLICATIONS. THEREFORE, WE RECOMMEND YOGA AS A SUPPORTIVE THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER TO RELIEVE POST-TREATMENT DISTRESS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
4 1077  56 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PSYCHOLOGIC FUNCTION AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER: A META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS META-ANALYSIS WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PSYCHOLOGIC FUNCTION AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER. DESIGN: A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH OF PUBMED, EMBASE, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, THE CHINESE BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE DATABASE, AND THE CHINESE DIGITAL JOURNALS FULL-TEXT DATABASE WAS CARRIED OUT. RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS (RCTS) EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA, VERSUS A CONTROL GROUP RECEIVING NO INTERVENTION, ON PSYCHOLOGIC FUNCTIONING AND QOL IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER WERE INCLUDED. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF INCLUDED RCTS WAS ASSESSED ACCORDING TO THE COCHRANE HANDBOOK FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF INTERVENTIONS 5.0.1, AND DATA WERE ANALYZED USING THE COCHRANE COLLABORATION'S REVIEW MANAGER 5.1. RESULTS: SIX (6) STUDIES INVOLVING 382 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED. THE META-ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT YOGA CAN IMPROVE QOL FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER. A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT FAVORING YOGA FOR THE OUTCOME OF QOL WAS FOUND (STANDARD MEAN DIFFERENCE=0.27, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [0.02, 0.52], P=0.03). ALTHOUGH THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PSYCHOLOGIC FUNCTION OUTCOMES--SUCH AS ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, DISTRESS AND SLEEP--WERE IN THE EXPECTED DIRECTION, THESE EFFECTS WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P>0.05). FATIGUE SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: THE PRESENT DATA PROVIDED LITTLE INDICATION OF HOW EFFECTIVE YOGA MIGHT BE WHEN THEY WERE APPLIED BY WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER EXCEPT FOR MILDLY EFFECTIVE IN QOL IMPROVEMENT. THE FINDINGS WERE BASED ON A SMALL BODY OF EVIDENCE IN WHICH METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY WAS NOT HIGH. FURTHER WELL-DESIGNED RCTS WITH LARGE SAMPLE SIZE ARE NEEDED TO CLARIFY THE UTILITY OF YOGA PRACTICE FOR THIS POPULATION.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
5 2144  46 THE EFFECTS OF MEDITATION, YOGA, AND MINDFULNESS ON DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND STRESS IN TERTIARY EDUCATION STUDENTS: A META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: MEDITATION, YOGA, AND MINDFULNESS ARE POPULAR INTERVENTIONS AT UNIVERSITIES AND TERTIARY EDUCATION INSTITUTES TO IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH. HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS ON DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND STRESS ARE UNCLEAR. THIS STUDY ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MEDITATION, YOGA, AND MINDFULNESS ON SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND STRESS IN TERTIARY EDUCATION STUDENTS. METHODS: WE SEARCHED COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL), PUBMED, PSYCINFO AND IDENTIFIED 11,936 ARTICLES. AFTER RETRIEVING 181 PAPERS FOR FULL-TEXT SCREENING, 24 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE INCLUDED IN THE QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS. WE CONDUCTED A RANDOM-EFFECTS META-ANALYSIS AMONGST 23 STUDIES WITH 1,373 PARTICIPANTS. RESULTS: AT POST-TEST, AFTER EXCLUSION OF OUTLIERS, EFFECT SIZES FOR DEPRESSION, G = 0.42 (95% CI: 0.16-0.69), ANXIETY G = 0.46 (95% CI: 0.34-0.59), STRESS G = 0.42 (95% CI: 0.27-0.57) WERE MODERATE. HETEROGENEITY WAS LOW (I (2) = 6%). WHEN COMPARED TO ACTIVE CONTROL, THE EFFECT DECREASED TO G = 0.13 (95% CI: -0.18-0.43). NO RCT REPORTED ON SAFETY, ONLY TWO STUDIES REPORTED ON ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT, MOST STUDIES HAD A HIGH RISK OF BIAS. CONCLUSIONS: MOST STUDIES WERE OF POOR QUALITY AND RESULTS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION. OVERALL MODERATE EFFECTS WERE FOUND WHICH DECREASED SUBSTANTIALLY WHEN INTERVENTIONS WERE COMPARED TO ACTIVE CONTROL. IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER MEDITATION, YOGA OR MINDFULNESS AFFECT ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OR AFFECT HAVE ANY NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
6 2178  44 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PAIN, MOBILITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVE. TO SYSTEMATICALLY ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PAIN, MOBILITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS. METHODS. PUBMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE, THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS, PHYSIOTHERAPY EVIDENCE DATABASE (PEDRO), AND OTHER SOURCES WERE SEARCHED SYSTEMATICALLY IN THIS STUDY. TWO REVIEWERS IDENTIFIED ELIGIBLE STUDIES AND EXTRACTED DATA INDEPENDENTLY. DOWNS AND BLACK'S QUALITY INDEX WERE USED TO EVALUATE THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES. RESULTS. A TOTAL OF 9 ARTICLES (6 STUDIES) INVOLVING 372 PATIENTS WITH KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. THE MOST COMMON YOGA PROTOCOL IS 40~90 MINUTES/SESSION, LASTING FOR AT LEAST 8 WEEKS. THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON PAIN RELIEF AND FUNCTION IMPROVEMENT COULD BE SEEN AFTER TWO-WEEK INTERVENTION. CONCLUSION. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW SHOWED THAT YOGA MIGHT HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS IN RELIEVING PAIN AND MOBILITY ON PATIENTS WITH KOA, BUT THE EFFECTS ON QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) ARE UNCLEAR. BESIDES, MORE OUTCOME MEASURE RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH OF YOGA EFFECTS ON PEOPLE WITH KOA SHOULD BE CONDUCTED.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
7 2566  43 YOGA FOR DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IN PEOPLE WITH CANCER: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVE: CANCER AND ITS TREATMENT CAN LEAD TO A VARIETY OF PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL CONCERNS IMPACTING ON THOSE AFFECTED, INCLUDING SUBCLINICAL OR CLINICAL DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, WHICH IN TURN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON WELLBEING, QUALITY OF LIFE AND SURVIVAL. THE AIM OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ON SELF-REPORTED DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IN PEOPLE WITH CANCER IN RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. METHOD: SIX DATABASES WERE SEARCHED TO IDENTIFY RELEVANT STUDIES. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW PROCEDURES WERE FOLLOWED INCLUDING A QUALITY ASSESSMENT. META-ANALYSIS OF SUITABLE STUDIES WAS CONDUCTED. RESULTS: 26 STUDIES FROM OUR SEARCH CRITERIA WERE ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION FOR DEPRESSIVE AND 16 FOR ANXIETY SYMPTOMS. META-ANALYSES REVEALED EVIDENCE FOR SIGNIFICANT MEDIUM EFFECTS OF YOGA ON DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS (N = 1,486, G = -0.419, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI] = -0.558 TO -0.281, P < 0.001) AND ANXIETY (N = 977, G = -0.347, 95% CI = -0.473 TO -0.221, P < 0.001) COMPARED TO CONTROLS. SUBGROUP ANALYSES FOR DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS REVEALED SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS FOR ALL ANALYSES PERFORMED (TYPE OF CANCER, TYPE OF CONTROL, TREATMENT STATUS, DURATION OF INTERVENTION OR FREQUENCY OF YOGA SESSIONS), WITH EFFECT SIZES BEING COMPARABLE BETWEEN SUBGROUPS. SIMILAR FINDINGS WERE FOUND FOR ANXIETY SYMPTOMS EXCEPT FOR TREATMENT STATUS, WHERE THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT WAS FOUND WHEN YOGA WAS DELIVERED DURING ACTIVE TREATMENT. CONCLUSIONS: THIS REVIEW PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT IN PEOPLE WITH CANCER, YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH AMELIORATION OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND THEREFORE A PROMISING THERAPEUTIC MODALITY FOR THEIR MANAGEMENT. HOWEVER, THE POTENTIAL FOR RISK OF BIAS TOGETHER WITH CONTROL GROUP DESIGN CHALLENGES MEANS THE RESULTS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                     
8 1043  43 EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON FATIGUE: A META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND. RESEARCHERS AIMED AT SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEWING AND META-ANALYZING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR FATIGUE. METHODS. PUBMED/MEDLINE WAS SEARCHED UNTIL JANUARY 2012 FOR CONTROLLED CLINICAL STUDIES. TWO REVIEWERS INDEPENDENTLY EXTRACTED THE DATA. THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF THE STUDIES WAS ASSESSED. A META-ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED. RESULTS. NINETEEN CLINICAL STUDIES (TOTAL N = 948) WERE INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW. INVESTIGATED YOGA STYLES INCLUDED HATHA, IYENGAR, ASANAS, PATANJALI, SAHAJA, AND TIBETAN YOGA. PARTICIPANTS WERE SUFFERING FROM CANCER, MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, DIALYSIS, CHRONIC PANCREATITIS, FIBROMYALGIA, ASTHMA, OR WERE HEALTHY. YOGA HAD A SMALL POSITIVE EFFECT ON FATIGUE (SMD = 0.27, 59% CI = 0.23-0.31). SEVEN STUDIES RECEIVED 4 POINTS ON THE JADAD SCORE. THERE WERE BASELINE DIFFERENCES IN AT LEAST 5 STUDIES. CONCLUSION. OVERALL, THE EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON FATIGUE WERE ONLY SMALL, PARTICULARLY IN CANCER PATIENTS. ALTHOUGH YOGA IS GENERALLY A SAFE THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION AND EFFECTIVE TO ATTENUATE OTHER HEALTH-RELATED SYMPTOMS, THIS META-ANALYSIS WAS NOT ABLE TO DEFINE THE POWERFUL EFFECT OF YOGA ON PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM FATIGUE. TREATMENT EFFECTS OF YOGA COULD BE IMPROVED IN WELL-DESIGNED FUTURE STUDIES. ACCORDING TO THE GRADE RECOMMENDATIONS ASSESSING THE OVERALL QUALITY OF EVIDENCE, THERE IS A MODERATE EFFECT OF THE CONFIDENCE PLACED IN THE ESTIMATES OF THE EFFECTS DISCUSSED HERE.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
9 2365  37 WALKING IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN YOGA AT REDUCING SLEEP DISTURBANCE IN CANCER PATIENTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. THIS REVIEW AIMED TO DETERMINE WHETHER WALKING IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN YOGA AT IMPROVING SLEEP DISTURBANCE IN CANCER PATIENTS. A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WAS PERFORMED IN THE PUBMED, EMBASE, CINAHL, COCHRANE LIBRARY, CNKI, AIRITI LIBRARY, AND OTHER HEALTH-RELATED DATABASES. TWENTY-FIVE STUDIES WERE IDENTIFIED WITH A TOTAL OF 1918 PARTICIPANTS. THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX WAS THE MOST COMMONLY USED OUTCOME MEASUREMENT TOOL, AND MODERATE-INTENSITY WALKING WAS THE MOST FREQUENTLY USED INTERVENTION. THE MAJORITY OF THE INCLUDED SUBJECTS WERE BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. OVERALL, WALKING SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED SLEEP DISTURBANCE COMPARED TO YOGA (P = 0.01). STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT MODERATORS INCLUDED ADHERENCE RATE FOR WALKING (P < 0.001) AND ALLOCATION CONCEALMENT AND OUTCOME MEASUREMENT TOOL FOR YOGA (P = 0.04; P = 0.03). WE CONCLUDED THAT WALKING IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN YOGA IN IMPROVING SLEEP DISTURBANCE IN CANCER PATIENTS. THUS, MODERATE-INTENSITY WALKING IS RECOMMENDED FOR CANCER PATIENTS WITH SLEEP DISTURBANCE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
10 2559  42 YOGA FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: A META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. OBJECTIVES: TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) USING A META-ANALYTICAL APPROACH. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) THAT EXAMINED PAIN ANDOR FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY AS TREATMENT OUTCOMES WERE INCLUDED. POST-TREATMENT AND FOLLOW-UP OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED. METHODS: A COMPREHENSIVE SEARCH OF RELEVANT ELECTRONIC DATABASES, FROM THE TIME OF THEIR INCEPTION UNTIL NOVEMBER 2011, WAS CONDUCTED. COHEN'S D EFFECT SIZES WERE CALCULATED AND ENTERED IN A RANDOM-EFFECTS MODEL. RESULTS: EIGHT RCTS MET THE CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION (EIGHT ASSESSING FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY AND FIVE ASSESSING PAIN) AND INVOLVED A TOTAL OF 743 PATIENTS. AT POST-TREATMENT, YOGA HAD A MEDIUM TO LARGE EFFECT ON FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY (D=0.645) AND PAIN (D=0.623). DESPITE A WIDE RANGE OF YOGA STYLES AND TREATMENT DURATIONS, HETEROGENEITY IN POST-TREATMENT EFFECT SIZES WAS LOW. FOLLOW-UP EFFECT SIZES FOR FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY AND PAIN WERE SMALLER, BUT REMAINED SIGNIFICANT (D=0.397 AND D=0.486, RESPECTIVELY); HOWEVER, THERE WAS A MODERATE TO HIGH LEVEL OF VARIABILITY IN THESE EFFECT SIZES. DISCUSSION: THE RESULTS OF THE PRESENT STUDY INDICATE THAT YOGA MAY BE AN EFFICACIOUS ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT FOR CLBP. THE STRONGEST AND MOST CONSISTENT EVIDENCE EMERGED FOR THE SHORT-TERM BENEFITS OF YOGA ON FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY. HOWEVER, BEFORE ANY DEFINITIVE CONCLUSIONS CAN BE DRAWN, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF METHODOLOGICAL CONCERNS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. IN PARTICULAR, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT FUTURE RCTS INCLUDE AN ACTIVE CONTROL GROUP TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOGA HAS SPECIFIC TREATMENT EFFECTS AND WHETHER YOGA OFFERS ANY ADVANTAGES OVER TRADITIONAL EXERCISE PROGRAMS AND OTHER ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES FOR CLBP.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
11 1608  39 META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS ON YOGA, PSYCHOSOCIAL, AND MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE: WHAT INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS ARE RELATED TO HIGHER EFFICACY? CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (CRF) IS A BURDENSOME SEQUELA OF CANCER TREATMENTS. BESIDES EXERCISE, RECOMMENDED THERAPIES FOR CRF INCLUDE YOGA, PSYCHOSOCIAL, AND MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS. HOWEVER, INTERVENTIONS CONDUCTED VARY WIDELY, AND NOT ALL SHOW A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT. THIS META-ANALYSIS AIMED TO EXPLORE INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS RELATED TO GREATER REDUCTIONS IN CRF. WE INCLUDED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS PUBLISHED BEFORE OCTOBER 2021. STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCES WERE USED TO ASSESS INTERVENTION EFFICACY FOR CRF AND MULTIMODEL INFERENCE TO EXPLORE INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER EFFICACY. FOR THE META-ANALYSIS, WE INCLUDED 70 INTERVENTIONS (24 YOGA INTERVENTIONS, 31 PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTIONS, AND 15 MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS) WITH 6387 PARTICIPANTS. THE RESULTS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF YOGA, PSYCHOSOCIAL, AND MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS ON CRF BUT WITH HIGH HETEROGENEITY BETWEEN STUDIES. FOR YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS, NO PARTICULAR INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTIC WAS IDENTIFIED TO BE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR REDUCING CRF. REGARDING PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTIONS, A GROUP SETTING AND WORK ON COGNITION WERE RELATED TO HIGHER INTERVENTION EFFECTS ON CRF. THE RESULTS OF THIS META-ANALYSIS SUGGEST OPTIONS TO MAXIMIZE THE INTERVENTION EFFECTS OF PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTIONS FOR CRF. THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR CRF APPEAR TO BE INDEPENDENT OF THEIR DESIGN, ALTHOUGH THE LIMITED NUMBER OF STUDIES POINTS TO THE NEED FOR FURTHER RESEARCH.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
12 1057  43 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IN PEOPLE WITH MENTAL DISORDERS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS WHETHER PHYSICALLY ACTIVE YOGA IS SUPERIOR TO WAITLIST CONTROL, TREATMENT AS USUAL AND ATTENTION CONTROL IN ALLEVIATING DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IN PEOPLE WITH A DIAGNOSED MENTAL DISORDER RECOGNISED BY THE DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS (DSM). DESIGN: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS FOLLOWING THE PREFERRED REPORTING ITEMS FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND META-ANALYSES (PRISMA) GUIDELINES. DATA SOURCES: DATA WERE OBTAINED FROM ONLINE DATABASES (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PSYCHINFO, CENTRAL, EMCARE, PEDRO). THE SEARCH AND COLLECTION OF ELIGIBLE STUDIES WAS CONDUCTED UP TO 14 MAY 2019 (PROSPERO REGISTRATION NO CRD42018090441). ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: WE INCLUDED RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS WITH A YOGA INTERVENTION COMPRISING >/=50% PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN ADULTS WITH A RECOGNISED DIAGNOSED MENTAL DISORDER ACCORDING TO DSM-3, 4 OR 5. RESULTS: 19 STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IN THE REVIEW (1080 PARTICIPANTS) AND 13 STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IN THE META-ANALYSIS (632 PARTICIPANTS). DISORDERS OF DEPRESSION, POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS, SCHIZOPHRENIA, ANXIETY, ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE AND BIPOLAR WERE INCLUDED. YOGA SHOWED GREATER REDUCTIONS IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS THAN WAITLIST, TREATMENT AS USUAL AND ATTENTION CONTROL (STANDARDISED MEAN DIFFERENCE=0.41; 95% CI -0.65 TO -0.17; P<0.001). GREATER REDUCTIONS IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER FREQUENCY OF YOGA SESSIONS PER WEEK (BETA=-0.44, P<0.01).	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
13 1740  51 PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA IN CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS, A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. BACKGROUND: THIS STUDY AIMED TO SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEW THE EVIDENCE FROM RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) AND TO CONDUCT A META-ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES IN CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS. METHODS: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE SEARCH IN TEN DATABASES WAS CONDUCTED IN NOVEMBER 2011. STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IF THEY HAD AN RCT DESIGN, FOCUSED ON CANCER PATIENTS OR SURVIVORS, INCLUDED PHYSICAL POSTURES IN THE YOGA PROGRAM, COMPARED YOGA WITH A NON-EXERCISE OR WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP, AND EVALUATED PHYSICAL AND/OR PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES. TWO RESEARCHERS INDEPENDENTLY RATED THE QUALITY OF THE INCLUDED RCTS, AND HIGH QUALITY WAS DEFINED AS >50% OF THE TOTAL POSSIBLE SCORE. EFFECT SIZES (COHEN'S D) WERE CALCULATED FOR OUTCOMES STUDIED IN MORE THAN THREE STUDIES AMONG PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER USING MEANS AND STANDARD DEVIATIONS OF POST-TEST SCORES OF THE INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS. RESULTS: SIXTEEN PUBLICATIONS OF 13 RCTS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA, OF WHICH ONE INCLUDED PATIENTS WITH LYMPHOMAS AND THE OTHERS FOCUSED ON PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. THE MEDIAN QUALITY SCORE WAS 67% (RANGE: 22-89%). THE INCLUDED STUDIES EVALUATED 23 PHYSICAL AND 20 PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES. OF THE OUTCOMES STUDIED IN MORE THAN THREE STUDIES AMONG PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER, WE FOUND LARGE REDUCTIONS IN DISTRESS, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION (D = -0.69 TO -0.75), MODERATE REDUCTIONS IN FATIGUE (D = -0.51), MODERATE INCREASES IN GENERAL QUALITY OF LIFE, EMOTIONAL FUNCTION AND SOCIAL FUNCTION (D = 0.33 TO 0.49), AND A SMALL INCREASE IN FUNCTIONAL WELL-BEING (D = 0.31). EFFECTS ON PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND SLEEP WERE SMALL AND NOT SIGNIFICANT. CONCLUSION: YOGA APPEARED TO BE A FEASIBLE INTERVENTION AND BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON SEVERAL PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL SYMPTOMS WERE REPORTED. IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER, EFFECT SIZE ON FUNCTIONAL WELL-BEING WAS SMALL, AND THEY WERE MODERATE TO LARGE FOR PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES.	2012	
             
14 2683  49 YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC DISEASE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: HEART DISEASE, STROKE, AND CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD) ARE THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH AND DISABILITY WORLDWIDE. ALTHOUGH INDIVIDUALS WITH THESE CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO BENEFIT FROM YOGA, ITS EFFECTIVENESS REMAINS UNCLEAR. OBJECTIVE: TO PERFORM A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA ON EXERCISE CAPACITY, HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQL), AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC DISEASE AND DESCRIBE THE STRUCTURE AND DELIVERY OF PROGRAMS. RESEARCH DESIGN: WE PERFORMED A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS EXAMINING YOGA PROGRAMS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH HEART DISEASE, STROKE, AND COPD COMPARED WITH USUAL CARE. QUALITY WAS ASSESSED USING THE COCHRANE RISK OF BIAS TOOL. META-ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED USING REVIEW MANAGER 5.3. THE PROTOCOL WAS REGISTERED ON PROSPERO (CRD42014014589). RESULTS: TEN STUDIES (431 INDIVIDUALS, MEAN AGE 56+/-8 Y) WERE INCLUDED AND WERE COMPARABLE IN THEIR DESIGN AND COMPONENTS, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE CHRONIC DISEASE. THE STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE FOR THE MEAN CHANGE IN EXERCISE CAPACITY WAS 2.69 (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, 1.39-3.99) AND FOR HRQL IT WAS 1.24 (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, -0.37 TO 2.85). SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY WERE REDUCED AFTER YOGA IN INDIVIDUALS WITH STROKE, ALTHOUGH THIS WAS NOT OBSERVED IN INDIVIDUALS WITH COPD. THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION VARIED ACROSS STUDIES WITH NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS COMPARED WITH USUAL CARE. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA PROGRAMS HAVE SIMILAR DESIGNS AND COMPONENTS ACROSS CHRONIC DISEASE POPULATIONS. COMPARED WITH USUAL CARE, YOGA RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN EXERCISE CAPACITY AND A MEAN IMPROVEMENT IN HRQL. YOGA PROGRAMS MAY BE A USEFUL ADJUNCT TO FORMAL REHABILITATION PROGRAMS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
15 1108  33 EFFECTS OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ON CANCER-ASSOCIATED COGNITIVE DECLINE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: TO SUMMARIZE AND EVALUATE EVIDENCE AVAILABLE ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CANCER-ASSOCIATED COGNITIVE DECLINE (CACD). RECENT FINDINGS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED USING FOUR DATABASES OF ARTICLES PUBLISHED BEFORE JANUARY 1, 2020. TEN ARTICLES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA (SIX RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS, TWO SINGLE-ARM STUDIES, ONE NON-RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, AND ONE CASE SERIES STUDY). STUDIES WERE PREDOMINANTLY CONDUCTED WITH BREAST CANCER PATIENTS USING LOW-INTENSITY HATHA YOGA PROGRAMS. OF THE 10 ARTICLES, FIVE REPORTED SOME POSITIVE EFFECTS ON CACD, BUT SIGNIFICANT BIASES WERE POSSIBLE DUE TO DESIGN SHORTCOMINGS. COHEN'S D EFFECT SIZES RANGED FROM |0.03| TO |0.74|. THE EVIDENCE TO DATE IS INSUFFICIENT TO SUGGEST THAT YOGA IS BENEFICIAL FOR ATTENUATING CACD. MORE RIGOROUS TRIALS CONTROLLING FOR NON-SPECIFIC FACTORS ARE WARRANTED. THE FIELD WOULD ALSO BENEFIT FROM EXAMINING SELF-DELIVERED MODES OF YOGA FOR TREATING CACD IN VARIOUS CANCER POPULATIONS TO ENHANCE PRACTICE SUSTAINABILITY AND GENERALIZABILITY.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
16  590  58 DETERMINING THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA IN CHRONIC STROKE CARE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: SURVIVORS OF STROKE HAVE LONG-TERM PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES THAT IMPACT THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE. FEW INTERVENTIONS ARE AVAILABLE IN THE COMMUNITY TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS. YOGA, A TYPE OF MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTION, IS SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN PEOPLE WITH OTHER CHRONIC ILLNESSES AND MAY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE PROBLEMS REPORTED BY SURVIVORS OF STROKE. OBJECTIVES: TO DATE ONLY NARRATIVE REVIEWS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED. WE SOUGHT TO PERFORM, THE FIRST SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WITH META-ANALYSES OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) THAT INVESTIGATED YOGA FOR ITS POTENTIAL BENEFIT FOR CHRONIC SURVIVORS OF STROKE. METHODS: OVID MEDLINE, CINHAL PLUS, AMED, PUBMED, PSYCHINFO, PEDRO, COCHRANE DATABASE, SPORT DISCUSS, AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR WERE SEARCHED FOR PAPERS PUBLISHED BETWEEN JANUARY 1950 AND AUGUST 2016. REFERENCE LISTS OF INCLUDED PAPERS, REVIEW ARTICLES AND OPENGREY FOR GREY LITERATURE WERE ALSO SEARCHED. WE USED A MODIFIED COCHRANE TOOL TO EVALUATE RISK OF BIAS. THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF RCTS WAS ASSESSED USING THE GRADE APPROACH, RESULTS WERE COLLATED, AND RANDOM EFFECTS META-ANALYSES PERFORMED WHERE APPROPRIATE. RESULTS: THE SEARCH YIELDED FIVE ELIGIBLE PAPERS FROM FOUR RCTS WITH SMALL SAMPLE SIZES (N = 17-47). QUALITY OF RCTS WAS RATED AS LOW TO MODERATE. YOGA IS BENEFICIAL IN REDUCING STATE ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND DEPRESSION IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP (MEAN DIFFERENCES FOR STATE ANXIETY 6.05, 95% CI:-0.02 TO 12.12; P = 0.05 AND STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCES FOR DEPRESSION: 0.50, 95% CI:-0.01 TO 1.02; P = 0.05). CONSISTENT BUT NONSIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE DEMONSTRATED FOR BALANCE, TRAIT ANXIETY, AND OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA MAY BE EFFECTIVE FOR AMELIORATING SOME OF THE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES OF STROKE. LARGE WELL-DESIGNED RCTS ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE FINDINGS.	2017	
                                                                                                                        
17 2184  37 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW STUDY. INTRODUCTION: THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN MENOPAUSAL WOMEN IS CONSIDERED TO BE AN IMPORTANT HEALTH ISSUE IN DIFFERENT SOCIETIES AND ONE OF THE MAIN OBJECTIVES OF HEALTH CARE IN THIS PERIOD. THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN MENOPAUSAL WOMEN. METHOD: ENGLISH DATABASES OF GOOGLE SCHOLAR, SCIENCE DIRECT, PUBMED, SCOPUS, AND COCHRANE LIBRARY WERE SEARCHED TO ACCESS RELATED ARTICLES USING KEYWORDS OF MENOPAUSE, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND YOGA. FURTHERMORE, PERSIAN EQUIVALENTS OF THE SAME KEYWORDS WERE SEARCHED IN DATABASES OF GOOGLE SCHOLAR, SID, AND MAGIRAN, IN ADDITION TO A COMBINATION OF THE KEYWORDS. THE SEARCH INTERVAL WAS FROM THE INSPECTION TO JANUARY 2020. THE QUALITY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIED WAS ASSESSED BASED ON CONSORT 2017 CHECKLIST. RESULTS: OUT OF 120 ARTICLES FOUND IN THE DATABASES, SIX ARTICLES ENTERED THE STUDY BASED ON THE INCLUSION CRITERIA AND WERE INVESTIGATED FOR INTERVENTION METHODS AND CONSEQUENCES. THE RESULTS INDICATED THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF YOGA ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN MENOPAUSAL WOMEN.

BACKGROUND: THE WORLD'S ELDERLY POPULATION IS GROWING. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY HAS POSITIVE EFFECTS ON HEALTH AND COGNITION, BUT IS DECREASING AMONG THE ELDERLY. INTEREST IN YOGA-BASED EXERCISES HAS INCREASED IN THIS POPULATION, ESPECIALLY AS AN INTERVENTION TARGETING BALANCE, FLEXIBILITY, STRENGTH, AND WELL-BEING. RECENT INTEREST HAS ARISEN REGARDING YOGA'S POTENTIAL BENEFITS FOR COGNITION. OBJECTIVE: TO SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEW EVIDENCE FROM RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ON COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING IN HEALTHY ADULTS AGED >/=60. A SECONDARY AIM WAS TO DESCRIBE INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS AND, WHERE POSSIBLE, THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE INFLUENCED STUDY OUTCOMES. METHOD: THE REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH PRISMA GUIDELINES. SEARCHES WERE PERFORMED FROM INCEPTION TO JUNE 2020 USING THE FOLLOWING ELECTRONIC DATABASES: (1) PUBMED (NLM); (2) EMBASE (ELSEVIER); (3) COCHRANE CENTRAL (WILEY); (4) PSYCINFO (EBSCOHOST); AND (5) CINAHL (EBSCOHOST). INCLUSION CRITERIA: RCTS OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ASSESSING COGNITION IN HEALTHY ADULTS >/=60 YEARS. RISK OF BIAS WAS ASSESSED USING THE REVISED COCHRANE RISK OF BIAS TOOL. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 1466 RECORDS WERE INITIALLY IDENTIFIED; SIX STUDIES (5 UNIQUE TRIALS) WERE INCLUDED IN THE REVIEW. FOUR OF THE SIX ARTICLES REPORTED SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ON COGNITION, INCLUDING GROSS MEMORY FUNCTIONING AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS. INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS AND ASSESSMENT METHODS VARIED BETWEEN STUDIES, WITH A HIGH OVERALL RISK OF BIAS IN ALL STUDIES. CONCLUSION: YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN COGNITION IN HEALTHY OLDER ADULTS. ADEQUATELY POWERED RCTS WITH ROBUST STUDY DESIGNS AND LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UPS ARE REQUIRED. FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD EXPLICITLY REPORT THE INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN COGNITIVE FUNCTION.	2021	
                                                                      
19 2181  46 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING AND HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN OLDER ADULTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVE: THE GOAL WAS TO REVIEW SYSTEMATICALLY THE COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA, COMPARED WITH OTHER EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS, FOR OLDER ADULTS AS SHOWN ON MEASURES OF HEALTH AND PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING. DESIGN: THIS WAS A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WITH BOTH NARRATIVE SYNTHESIS AND META-ANALYSIS. DATA SOURCES: SEARCHES WERE CONDUCTED IN MEDLINE(R)/PUBMED, PSYCINFO, CINAHL, WEB OF SCIENCE, AND SCOPUS; BIBLIOGRAPHIES OF SELECTED ARTICLES; AND ONE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. METHODS: ORIGINAL STUDIES FROM 1950 TO NOVEMBER 2010 WERE SOUGHT, EVALUATING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON OLDER ADULTS. THE SEARCH WAS RESTRICTED TO RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS OF YOGA IN SUBJECTS >/=AGE 60, AND PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH. DATA WERE EXTRACTED AND EVALUATED REGARDING SETTING, POPULATION SIZE AND CHARACTERISTICS, INTERVENTION TYPE AND DURATION, COMPARISON GROUP, OUTCOME ASSESSMENT, DATA ANALYSIS, FOLLOW-UP, KEY RESULTS, AND THE QUALITY OF EACH STUDY ACCORDING TO SPECIFIC PREDETERMINED CRITERIA. RESULTS: THE SEARCH YIELDED 18 ELIGIBLE STUDIES (N=649). THE STUDIES REPORTED ON OLDER ADULTS ACROSS A RANGE OF SETTINGS, INTERVENTION INTENSITY, AND OUTCOME MEASURES. THE MAJORITY OF THE STUDIES HAD<35 PARTICIPANTS (RANGE 9-77). QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE SYNTHESIS OF THE STUDIES SUGGESTED THAT THE BENEFITS OF YOGA MAY EXCEED THOSE OF CONVENTIONAL EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS FOR SELF-RATED HEALTH STATUS, AEROBIC FITNESS, AND STRENGTH. HOWEVER, THE EFFECT SIZES WERE MODEST, AND THE EVIDENCE WAS MIXED FOR YOGA'S EFFECT ON DEPRESSION, SLEEP, AND BONE-MINERAL DENSITY. STUDIES DID NOT FIND AN EFFECT ON COGNITION. CONCLUSIONS: SMALL STUDIES WITH MIXED METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY SUGGESTED THAT YOGA MAY BE SUPERIOR TO CONVENTIONAL PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY INTERVENTIONS IN ELDERLY PEOPLE. THE PRECISION OF THE ESTIMATES REMAINS LOW. LARGER STUDIES ARE NECESSARY TO DEFINE BETTER THE INTERSECTION OF POPULATIONS, SETTINGS, AND INTERVENTIONS IN WHICH YOGA IS MOST BENEFICIAL.	2012	

20   83  40 A META-ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR MATERNAL DEPRESSION DURING PREGNANCY. PROMPT AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OF MATERNAL DEPRESSION DURING PREGNANCY IS IMPORTANT AS IT IS AN INDEPENDENT PREDICTOR OF NEGATIVE MATERNAL AND FETAL OUTCOMES. YOGA IS AN INCREASINGLY POPULAR NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL MODALITY. THIS STUDY THUS AIMED TO UNDERTAKE A META-ANALYSIS OF THE EFFICACY OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR MATERNAL DEPRESSION DURING PREGNANCY. A TOTAL OF 8 CLINICAL STUDIES WERE SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEWED, AND 6 STUDIES WITH A TOTAL OF 405 PREGNANT MOTHERS WERE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL META-ANALYSIS. APPLYING PER-PROTOCOL ANALYSIS AND A RANDOM-EFFECTS MODEL, THE POOLED STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE (SMD) FROM BASELINE DEPRESSIVE SCORE WAS -0.452 (95% CI: -0.816 TO -0.880, P=0.015), SUPPORTING A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ON MOOD. OVERALL, YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ARE A PROMISING NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL OPTION, HOWEVER, MOST TRIALS EXAMINED WERE PRELIMINARY, RECRUITED ONLY PARTICIPANTS WITH MILD DEPRESSION, DID NOT BLIND STUDY PARTICIPANTS AND HAD RELATIVELY SMALL SAMPLE SIZES. LARGER RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIALS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED.	2019

1 2245 155 THE INFLUENCE OF YOGA-BASED PROGRAMS ON RISK PROFILES IN ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE THAT YOGA MAY OFFER A SAFE AND COST-EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM 2). HOWEVER, SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS ARE LACKING. THIS ARTICLE CRITICALLY REVIEWS THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA-BASED PROGRAMS ON PHYSIOLOGIC AND ANTHROPOMETRIC RISK PROFILES AND RELATED CLINICAL OUTCOMES IN ADULTS WITH DM 2. WE PERFORMED A COMPREHENSIVE LITERATURE SEARCH USING FOUR COMPUTERIZED ENGLISH AND INDIAN SCIENTIFIC DATABASES. THE SEARCH WAS RESTRICTED TO ORIGINAL STUDIES (1970-2006) THAT EVALUATED THE METABOLIC AND CLINICAL EFFECTS OF YOGA IN ADULTS WITH DM 2. STUDIES TARGETING CLINICAL POPULATIONS WITH CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS THAT INCLUDED ADULTS WITH COMORBID DM WERE ALSO EVALUATED. DATA WERE EXTRACTED REGARDING STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, TARGET POPULATION, INTERVENTION, COMPARISON GROUP OR CONDITION, OUTCOME ASSESSMENT, DATA ANALYSIS AND PRESENTATION, FOLLOW-UP, AND KEY RESULTS, AND THE QUALITY OF EACH STUDY WAS EVALUATED ACCORDING TO SPECIFIC PREDETERMINED CRITERIA. WE IDENTIFIED 25 ELIGIBLE STUDIES, INCLUDING 15 UNCONTROLLED TRIALS, 6 NON-RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS AND 4 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS). OVERALL, THESE STUDIES SUGGEST BENEFICIAL CHANGES IN SEVERAL RISK INDICES, INCLUDING GLUCOSE TOLERANCE AND INSULIN SENSITIVITY, LIPID PROFILES, ANTHROPOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS, BLOOD PRESSURE, OXIDATIVE STRESS, COAGULATION PROFILES, SYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION AND PULMONARY FUNCTION, AS WELL AS IMPROVEMENT IN SPECIFIC CLINICAL OUTCOMES. YOGA MAY IMPROVE RISK PROFILES IN ADULTS WITH DM 2, AND MAY HAVE PROMISE FOR THE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF CARDIOVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS IN THIS POPULATION. HOWEVER, THE LIMITATIONS CHARACTERIZING MOST STUDIES PRECLUDE DRAWING FIRM CONCLUSIONS. ADDITIONAL HIGH-QUALITY RCTS ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM AND FURTHER ELUCIDATE THE EFFECTS OF STANDARDIZED YOGA PROGRAMS IN POPULATIONS WITH DM 2.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
2 1910 117 RISK INDICES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INSULIN RESISTANCE SYNDROME, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, AND POSSIBLE PROTECTION WITH YOGA: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVE: TO CONDUCT A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF PUBLISHED LITERATURE REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA, A PROMISING MIND-BODY THERAPY, ON SPECIFIC ANTHROPOMETRIC AND PHYSIOLOGIC INDICES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (CVD) RISK AND ON RELATED CLINICAL ENDPOINTS. METHODS: WE PERFORMED A LITERATURE SEARCH USING 4 COMPUTERIZED ENGLISH AND INDIAN SCIENTIFIC DATABASES. THE SEARCH WAS RESTRICTED TO ORIGINAL STUDIES (1970 TO 2004) EVALUATING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CVD OR INDICES OF CVD RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE INSULIN RESISTANCE SYNDROME (IRS). RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS), NONRANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS, UNCONTROLLED (PRE AND POST) CLINICAL TRIALS, AND CROSS-SECTIONAL (OBSERVATIONAL) STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IF THEY MET SPECIFIC CRITERIA. DATA WERE EXTRACTED REGARDING STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, POPULATION SIZE AND CHARACTERISTICS, INTERVENTION TYPE AND DURATION, COMPARISON GROUP OR CONDITION, OUTCOME ASSESSMENT, DATA ANALYSIS AND PRESENTATION, FOLLOW-UP, AND KEY RESULTS, AND THE QUALITY OF EACH STUDY WAS EVALUATED ACCORDING TO SPECIFIC PREDETERMINED CRITERIA. RESULTS: WE IDENTIFIED 70 ELIGIBLE STUDIES, INCLUDING 1 OBSERVATIONAL STUDY, 26 UNCONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS, 21 NONRANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS, AND 22 RCTS. TOGETHER, THE REPORTED RESULTS OF THESE STUDIES INDICATE BENEFICIAL CHANGES OVERALL IN SEVERAL IRS-RELATED INDICES OF CVD RISK, INCLUDING GLUCOSE TOLERANCE AND INSULIN SENSITIVITY, LIPID PROFILES, ANTHROPOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS, BLOOD PRESSURE, OXIDATIVE STRESS, COAGULATION PROFILES, SYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION, AND CARDIOVAGAL FUNCTION, AS WELL AS IMPROVEMENT IN SEVERAL CLINICAL ENDPOINTS. CONCLUSIONS: COLLECTIVELY, THESE STUDIES SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY REDUCE MANY IRS-RELATED RISK FACTORS FOR CVD, MAY IMPROVE CLINICAL OUTCOMES, AND MAY AID IN THE MANAGEMENT OF CVD AND OTHER IRS-RELATED CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, THE METHODOLOGIC AND OTHER LIMITATIONS CHARACTERIZING MOST OF THESE STUDIES PRECLUDE DRAWING FIRM CONCLUSIONS. ADDITIONAL HIGH QUALITY RCTS ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM AND FURTHER ELUCIDATE THE EFFECTS OF STANDARDIZED YOGA PROGRAMS ON SPECIFIC INDICES OF CVD RISK AND RELATED CLINICAL ENDPOINTS.	2005	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
3 2629  63 YOGA FOR THE PRIMARY PREVENTION OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. BACKGROUND: A SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE AND STRESS ARE MAJOR RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (CVD). SINCE YOGA INVOLVES EXERCISE AND IS THOUGHT TO HELP IN STRESS REDUCTION IT MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY IN THE PRIMARY PREVENTION OF CVD. OBJECTIVES: TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF ANY TYPE OF YOGA ON THE PRIMARY PREVENTION OF CVD. SEARCH METHODS: WE SEARCHED THE FOLLOWING ELECTRONIC DATABASES: THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL) (2013, ISSUE 11) IN THE COCHRANE LIBRARY; MEDLINE (OVID) (1946 TO NOVEMBER WEEK 3 2013); EMBASE CLASSIC + EMBASE (OVID) (1947 TO 2013 WEEK 48); WEB OF SCIENCE (THOMSON REUTERS) (1970 TO 4 DECEMBER 2013); DATABASE OF ABSTRACTS OF REVIEWS OF EFFECTS (DARE), HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT DATABASE AND HEALTH ECONOMICS EVALUATIONS DATABASE (ISSUE 4 OF 4, 2013) IN THE COCHRANE LIBRARY. WE ALSO SEARCHED A NUMBER OF ASIAN DATABASES AND THE ALLIED AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE DATABASE (AMED) (INCEPTION TO DECEMBER 2012). WE SEARCHED TRIAL REGISTERS AND REFERENCE LISTS OF REVIEWS AND ARTICLES, AND APPROACHED EXPERTS IN THE FIELD. WE APPLIED NO LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS. SELECTION CRITERIA: RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS LASTING AT LEAST THREE MONTHS INVOLVING HEALTHY ADULTS OR THOSE AT HIGH RISK OF CVD. TRIALS EXAMINED ANY TYPE OF YOGA AND THE COMPARISON GROUP WAS NO INTERVENTION OR MINIMAL INTERVENTION. OUTCOMES OF INTEREST WERE CLINICAL CVD EVENTS AND MAJOR CVD RISK FACTORS. WE DID NOT INCLUDE ANY TRIALS THAT INVOLVED MULTIFACTORIAL LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS OR WEIGHT LOSS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: TWO AUTHORS INDEPENDENTLY SELECTED TRIALS FOR INCLUSION, EXTRACTED DATA AND ASSESSED THE RISK OF BIAS. MAIN RESULTS: WE IDENTIFIED 11 TRIALS (800 PARTICIPANTS) AND TWO ONGOING STUDIES. STYLE AND DURATION OF YOGA DIFFERED BETWEEN TRIALS. HALF OF THE PARTICIPANTS RECRUITED TO THE STUDIES WERE AT HIGH RISK OF CVD. MOST OF STUDIES WERE AT RISK OF PERFORMANCE BIAS, WITH INADEQUATE DETAILS REPORTED IN MANY OF THEM TO JUDGE THE RISK OF SELECTION BIAS.NO STUDY REPORTED CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY, ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY OR NON-FATAL EVENTS, AND MOST STUDIES WERE SMALL AND SHORT-TERM. THERE WAS SUBSTANTIAL HETEROGENEITY BETWEEN STUDIES MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO COMBINE STUDIES STATISTICALLY FOR SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND TOTAL CHOLESTEROL. YOGA WAS FOUND TO PRODUCE REDUCTIONS IN DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) -2.90 MMHG, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) -4.52 TO -1.28), WHICH WAS STABLE ON SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, TRIGLYCERIDES (MD -0.27 MMOL/L, 95% CI -0.44 TO -0.11) AND HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (HDL) CHOLESTEROL (MD 0.08 MMOL/L, 95% CI 0.02 TO 0.14). HOWEVER, THE CONTRIBUTING STUDIES WERE SMALL, SHORT-TERM AND AT UNCLEAR OR HIGH RISK OF BIAS. THERE WAS NO CLEAR EVIDENCE OF A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS FOR LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (LDL) CHOLESTEROL (MD -0.09 MMOL/L, 95% CI -0.48 TO 0.30), ALTHOUGH THERE WAS MODERATE STATISTICAL HETEROGENEITY. ADVERSE EVENTS, OCCURRENCE OF TYPE 2 DIABETES AND COSTS WERE NOT REPORTED IN ANY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES. QUALITY OF LIFE WAS MEASURED IN THREE TRIALS BUT THE RESULTS WERE INCONCLUSIVE. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: THE LIMITED EVIDENCE COMES FROM SMALL, SHORT-TERM, LOW-QUALITY STUDIES. THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT YOGA HAS FAVOURABLE EFFECTS ON DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE, HDL CHOLESTEROL AND TRIGLYCERIDES, AND UNCERTAIN EFFECTS ON LDL CHOLESTEROL. THESE RESULTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS EXPLORATORY AND INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
4 2616  55 YOGA FOR SECONDARY PREVENTION OF CORONARY HEART DISEASE. BACKGROUND: CORONARY HEART DISEASE (CHD) IS THE MAJOR CAUSE OF EARLY MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IN MOST DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. SECONDARY PREVENTION AIMS TO PREVENT REPEAT CARDIAC EVENTS AND DEATH IN PEOPLE WITH ESTABLISHED CHD. LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN SECONDARY PREVENTION. YOGA HAS BEEN REGARDED AS A TYPE OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AS WELL AS A STRESS MANAGEMENT STRATEGY. GROWING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA ON VARIOUS AILMENTS. OBJECTIVES: TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR THE SECONDARY PREVENTION OF MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY IN, AND ON THE HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE OF, INDIVIDUALS WITH CHD. SEARCH METHODS: THIS IS AN UPDATE OF A REVIEW PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED IN 2012. FOR THIS UPDATED REVIEW, WE SEARCHED THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL) IN THE COCHRANE LIBRARY (ISSUE 1 OF 12, 2014), MEDLINE (1948 TO FEBRUARY WEEK 1 2014), EMBASE (1980 TO 2014 WEEK 6), WEB OF SCIENCE (THOMSON REUTERS, 1970 TO 12 FEBRUARY 2014), CHINA JOURNAL NET (1994 TO MAY 2014), WANFANG DATA (1990 TO MAY 2014), AND INDEX TO CHINESE PERIODICALS OF HONG KONG (HKINCHIP) (FROM 1980). ONGOING STUDIES WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE METAREGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (MAY 2014) AND THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION INTERNATIONAL CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRY PLATFORM (MAY 2014). WE APPLIED NO LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS. SELECTION CRITERIA: WE PLANNED TO INCLUDE RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) INVESTIGATING THE INFLUENCE OF YOGA PRACTICE ON CHD OUTCOMES IN MEN AND WOMEN (AGED 18 YEARS AND OVER) WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF ACUTE OR CHRONIC CHD. STUDIES WERE ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION IF THEY HAD A FOLLOW-UP DURATION OF SIX MONTHS OR MORE. WE CONSIDERED STUDIES THAT COMPARED ONE GROUP PRACTICING A TYPE OF YOGA WITH A CONTROL GROUP RECEIVING EITHER NO INTERVENTION OR INTERVENTIONS OTHER THAN YOGA. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: TWO AUTHORS INDEPENDENTLY SELECTED STUDIES ACCORDING TO PRESPECIFIED INCLUSION CRITERIA. WE RESOLVED DISAGREEMENTS EITHER BY CONSENSUS OR BY DISCUSSION WITH A THIRD AUTHOR. MAIN RESULTS: WE FOUND NO ELIGIBLE RCTS THAT MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA OF THE REVIEW AND THUS WE WERE UNABLE TO PERFORM A META-ANALYSIS. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR SECONDARY PREVENTION IN CHD REMAINS UNCERTAIN. LARGE RCTS OF HIGH QUALITY ARE NEEDED.	2015

METHODS: WE CONDUCTED AN ELECTRONIC LITERATURE SEARCH INCLUDING CINAHL, COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL), EMBASE, MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, AND MANUAL SEARCH OF RETRIEVED ARTICLES FROM INCEPTION OF EACH DATABASE UNTIL DECEMBER 2008. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) AND NONRANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (NRCTS) WERE SELECTED THAT INCLUDED YOGA OR YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS AGED 0 TO 21 YEARS. DATA WERE EXTRACTED AND ARTICLES CRITICALLY REVIEWED USING A MODIFIED JADAD SCORE AND DESCRIPTIVE METHODOLOGICAL CRITERIA, WITH SUMMARIZATION IN TABLES. RESULTS: THIRTY-FOUR CONTROLLED STUDIES PUBLISHED FROM 1979 TO 2008 WERE IDENTIFIED, WITH 19 RCTS AND 15 NRCTS. MANY STUDIES WERE OF LOW METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY. CLINICAL AREAS FOR WHICH YOGA HAS BEEN STUDIED INCLUDE PHYSICAL FITNESS, CARDIORESPIRATORY EFFECTS, MOTOR SKILLS/STRENGTH, MENTAL HEALTH AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS, BEHAVIOR AND DEVELOPMENT, IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME, AND BIRTH OUTCOMES FOLLOWING PRENATAL YOGA. NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED IN TRIALS REVIEWED. ALTHOUGH A LARGE MAJORITY OF STUDIES WERE POSITIVE, METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS SUCH AS RANDOMIZATION METHODS, WITHDRAWAL/DROPOUTS, AND DETAILS OF YOGA INTERVENTION PRECLUDE CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE. CONCLUSIONS: THERE ARE LIMITED DATA ON THE CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF YOGA AMONG THE PEDIATRIC POPULATION. MOST PUBLISHED CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE SUGGESTIVE OF BENEFIT, BUT RESULTS ARE PRELIMINARY BASED ON LOW QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF TRIALS. FURTHER RESEARCH OF YOGA FOR CHILDREN BY USING A HIGHER STANDARD OF METHODOLOGY AND REPORTING IS WARRANTED.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
6 2121  48 THE EFFECTIVENESS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF PREGNANCY YOGA INTERVENTIONS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW PROTOCOL. BACKGROUND: THE PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW IS TO SYSTEMATICALLY EXAMINE THE REPORTED CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF PREGNANCY YOGA. THE REVIEW WILL USE THE FITT (FREQUENCY, INTENSITY, TIME/DURATION AND TYPE) PRINCIPLE OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO CHARACTERISE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN EVALUATED IN THE INCLUDED STUDIES. STUDIES WILL BE CATEGORISED AS EFFECTIVENESS OR EFFICACY STUDIES AND THIS CONTINUUM OF EFFICACY VERSUS EFFECTIVENESS WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE FULL REVIEW. METHODS/DESIGN: THE FOLLOWING ELECTRONIC DATABASES WILL BE SEARCHED USING A DETAILED SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, WHOLIS, AMED, SCIELO, ASSIA AND WEB OF SCIENCE. RANDOMISED CONTROL TRIALS AND QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES EXAMINING PREGNANCY YOGA AND REPORTING ON EFFECT WILL BE INCLUDED. TITLES, ABSTRACTS AND FULL ARTICLES WILL BE SCREENED BY TWO INVESTIGATORS INDEPENDENTLY TO IDENTIFY ELIGIBLE STUDIES. THE COCHRANE COLLABORATION'S RISK OF BIAS ASSESSMENT TOOL WILL BE USED TO ASSESS STUDY QUALITY. QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE WILL BE EVALUATED USING THE GRADE CRITERIA. A STANDARDISED DATA EXTRACTION FORM WILL BE USED TO EXTRACT DATA. EFFECT SIZES WILL BE ESTIMATED USING MEAN DIFFERENCES FOR CONTINUOUS OUTCOMES, AND RELATIVE RISKS FOR DICHOTOMOUS OUTCOME. WHERE POSSIBLE, POOLING OF EFFECT ESTIMATES WILL BE DONE USING A RANDOM EFFECT MODEL. THE OUTCOMES OF INTEREST ARE QUALITY OF LIFE, STRESS, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, MODE OF BIRTH, LABOUR DURATION AND PAIN MANAGEMENT IN LABOUR. DISCUSSION: THIS REVIEW WILL SYNTHESISE THE BEST AVAILABLE EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA DURING PREGNANCY AND PROVIDE VALUABLE HIGH-QUALITY INFORMATION FOR CLINICIANS AND HEALTH POLICYMAKERS. FINDINGS WILL BE DISSEMINATED THROUGH PUBLICATION IN A PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL AND PRESENTATION AT RELEVANT CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS.

7  105  38 A PILOT FEASIBILITY STUDY OF WHOLE-SYSTEMS AYURVEDIC MEDICINE AND YOGA THERAPY FOR WEIGHT LOSS. OBJECTIVE: TO DEVELOP AND TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF A WHOLE-SYSTEMS LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION FOR OBESITY TREATMENT BASED ON THE PRACTICES OF AYURVEDIC MEDICINE/ YOGA THERAPY. DESIGN: A PRE-POST WEIGHT LOSS INTERVENTION PILOT STUDY USING CONVENTIONAL AND AYURVEDIC DIAGNOSIS INCLUSION CRITERIA, TAILORED TREATMENT WITHIN A STANDARDIZED TREATMENT ALGORITHM, AND STANDARDIZED DATA COLLECTION INSTRUMENTS FOR COLLECTING AYURVEDIC OUTCOMES. PARTICIPANTS: A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF OVERWEIGHT/OBESE ADULT COMMUNITY MEMBERS FROM TUCSON, ARIZONA INTERESTED IN A "HOLISTIC WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM" AND MEETING PREDETERMINED INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA. INTERVENTION: A COMPREHENSIVE DIET, ACTIVITY, AND LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION PROGRAM BASED ON PRINCIPLES OF AYURVEDIC MEDICINE/YOGA THERAPY WITH SIGNIFICANT SELF-MONITORING OF LIFESTYLE BEHAVIORS. THE 3-MONTH PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED TO CHANGE EATING AND ACTIVITY PATTERNS AND TO IMPROVE SELF-EFFICACY, QUALITY OF LIFE, WELL-BEING, VITALITY, AND SELF-AWARENESS AROUND FOOD CHOICES, STRESS MANAGEMENT, AND BARRIERS TO WEIGHT LOSS. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: CHANGES IN BODY WEIGHT, BODY MASS INDEX; BODY FAT PERCENTAGE, FAT/LEAN MASS, WAIST/HIP CIRCUMFERENCE AND RATIO, AND BLOOD PRESSURE. SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: DIET AND EXERCISE SELF-EFFICACY SCALES; PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE; VISUAL ANALOG SCALES (VAS) OF ENERGY, APPETITE, STRESS, QUALITY OF LIFE, WELL-BEING, AND PROGRAM SATISFACTION AT ALL TIME POINTS. RESULTS: TWENTY-TWO ADULTS ATTENDED AN IN-PERSON AYURVEDIC SCREENING; 17 INITIATED THE INTERVENTION, AND 12 COMPLETED THE 3-MONTH INTERVENTION. TWELVE COMPLETED FOLLOW-UP AT 6 MONTHS AND 11 COMPLETED FOLLOW-UP AT 9 MONTHS. MEAN WEIGHT LOSS AT 3 MONTHS WAS 3.54 KG (SD 4.76); 6 MONTHS: 4.63 KG, (SD 6.23) AND 9 MONTHS: 5.9 KG (SD 8.52). SELF-REPORT OF PROGRAM SATISFACTION WAS MORE THAN 90% AT ALL TIME POINTS. CONCLUSIONS: AN AYURVEDA-/YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION PROGRAM IS AN ACCEPTABLE AND FEASIBLE APPROACH TO WEIGHT MANAGEMENT. DATA COLLECTION, INCLUDING SELF-MONITORING AND CONVENTIONAL AND AYURVEDIC OUTCOMES, DID NOT UNDULY BURDEN PARTICIPANTS, WITH ATTRITION SIMILAR TO THAT OF OTHER WEIGHT LOSS STUDIES.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
8  546  32 CONTENT, STRUCTURE AND DELIVERY CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOARTHRITIS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW PROTOCOL. THE GLOBAL BURDEN OF OSTEOARTHRITIS AMONG ADULTS IS RISING. YOGA MIGHT BE A POTENTIAL SOLUTION FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOARTHRITIS. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AIMS TO SYNTHESISE THE CONTENT, STRUCTURE AND DELIVERY CHARACTERISTICS OF EFFECTIVE YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOARTHRITIS. THE JBI METHODOLOGY FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF EFFECTIVENESS AND THE PREFERRED REPORTING ITEMS FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND META-ANALYSES (PRISMA) GUIDELINES WILL BE FOLLOWED. RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOARTHRITIS IN ADULTS WILL BE INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW. WE AIM TO SEARCH THE FOLLOWING DATABASES TO FIND PUBLISHED AND UNPUBLISHED STUDIES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PSYCINFO, SPORTDISCUS, AMED, WEB OF SCIENCE, CENTRAL, TRIP, AYUSH RESEARCH PORTAL, ABIM, CAM-QUEST, PEDRO, OPENGREY, ETHOS, PROQUEST DISSERTATIONS AND THESES AND DART-EUROPE-E-THESES PORTAL. NO DATE OR LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS WILL BE APPLIED. A NARRATIVE SYNTHESIS WILL BE CONDUCTED WITH THE HELP OF TABLES. A META-REGRESSION WILL BE CONDUCTED TO EXPLORE THE STATISTICAL EVIDENCE FOR WHICH THE COMPONENTS (CONTENT, STRUCTURE AND DELIVERY CHARACTERISTICS) OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ARE EFFECTIVE.	2022

9 2543  67 YOGA FOR ASTHMA. BACKGROUND: ASTHMA IS A COMMON CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY DISORDER AFFECTING ABOUT 300 MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE. AS A HOLISTIC THERAPY, YOGA HAS THE POTENTIAL TO RELIEVE BOTH THE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SUFFERING OF PEOPLE WITH ASTHMA, AND ITS POPULARITY HAS EXPANDED GLOBALLY. A NUMBER OF CLINICAL TRIALS HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA PRACTICE, WITH INCONSISTENT RESULTS. OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN PEOPLE WITH ASTHMA. SEARCH METHODS: WE SYSTEMATICALLY SEARCHED THE COCHRANE AIRWAYS GROUP REGISTER OF TRIALS, WHICH IS DERIVED FROM SYSTEMATIC SEARCHES OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATABASES INCLUDING THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, AND PSYCINFO, AND HANDSEARCHING OF RESPIRATORY JOURNALS AND MEETING ABSTRACTS. WE ALSO SEARCHED PEDRO. WE SEARCHED CLINICALTRIALS.GOV AND THE WHO ICTRP SEARCH PORTAL. WE SEARCHED ALL DATABASES FROM THEIR INCEPTION TO 22 JULY 2015, AND USED NO RESTRICTION ON LANGUAGE OF PUBLICATION. WE CHECKED THE REFERENCE LISTS OF ELIGIBLE STUDIES AND RELEVANT REVIEW ARTICLES FOR ADDITIONAL STUDIES. WE ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT INVESTIGATORS OF ELIGIBLE STUDIES AND EXPERTS IN THE FIELD TO LEARN OF OTHER PUBLISHED AND UNPUBLISHED STUDIES. SELECTION CRITERIA: WE INCLUDED RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) THAT COMPARED YOGA WITH USUAL CARE (OR NO INTERVENTION) OR SHAM INTERVENTION IN PEOPLE WITH ASTHMA AND REPORTED AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING OUTCOMES: QUALITY OF LIFE, ASTHMA SYMPTOM SCORE, ASTHMA CONTROL, LUNG FUNCTION MEASURES, ASTHMA MEDICATION USAGE, AND ADVERSE EVENTS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: WE EXTRACTED BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, CHARACTERISTICS OF PARTICIPANTS, CHARACTERISTICS OF INTERVENTIONS AND CONTROLS, CHARACTERISTICS OF METHODOLOGY, AND RESULTS FOR THE OUTCOMES OF OUR INTEREST FROM ELIGIBLE STUDIES. FOR CONTINUOUS OUTCOMES, WE USED MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) WITH 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) TO DENOTE THE TREATMENT EFFECTS, IF THE OUTCOMES WERE MEASURED BY THE SAME SCALE ACROSS STUDIES. ALTERNATIVELY, IF THE OUTCOMES WERE MEASURED BY DIFFERENT SCALES ACROSS STUDIES, WE USED STANDARDISED MEAN DIFFERENCE (SMD) WITH 95% CI. FOR DICHOTOMOUS OUTCOMES, WE USED RISK RATIO (RR) WITH 95% CI TO MEASURE THE TREATMENT EFFECTS. WE PERFORMED META-ANALYSIS WITH REVIEW MANAGER 5.3. WE USED THE FIXED-EFFECT MODEL TO POOL THE DATA, UNLESS THERE WAS SUBSTANTIAL HETEROGENEITY AMONG STUDIES, IN WHICH CASE WE USED THE RANDOM-EFFECTS MODEL INSTEAD. FOR OUTCOMES INAPPROPRIATE OR IMPOSSIBLE TO POOL QUANTITATIVELY, WE CONDUCTED A DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS AND SUMMARISED THE FINDINGS NARRATIVELY. MAIN RESULTS: WE INCLUDED 15 RCTS WITH A TOTAL OF 1048 PARTICIPANTS. MOST OF THE TRIALS WERE CONDUCTED IN INDIA, FOLLOWED BY EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES. THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS WERE ADULTS OF BOTH SEXES WITH MILD TO MODERATE ASTHMA FOR SIX MONTHS TO MORE THAN 23 YEARS. FIVE STUDIES INCLUDED YOGA BREATHING ALONE, WHILE THE OTHER STUDIES ASSESSED YOGA INTERVENTIONS THAT INCLUDED BREATHING, POSTURE, AND MEDITATION. INTERVENTIONS LASTED FROM TWO WEEKS TO 54 MONTHS, FOR NO MORE THAN SIX MONTHS IN THE MAJORITY OF STUDIES. THE RISK OF BIAS WAS LOW ACROSS ALL DOMAINS IN ONE STUDY AND UNCLEAR OR HIGH IN AT LEAST ONE DOMAIN FOR THE REMAINDER.THERE WAS SOME EVIDENCE THAT YOGA MAY IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE (MD IN ASTHMA QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE (AQLQ) SCORE PER ITEM 0.57 UNITS ON A 7-POINT SCALE, 95% CI 0.37 TO 0.77; 5 STUDIES; 375 PARTICIPANTS), IMPROVE SYMPTOMS (SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.09 TO 0.65; 3 STUDIES; 243 PARTICIPANTS), AND REDUCE MEDICATION USAGE (RR 5.35, 95% CI 1.29 TO 22.11; 2 STUDIES) IN PEOPLE WITH ASTHMA. THE MD FOR AQLQ SCORE EXCEEDED THE MINIMAL CLINICALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE (MCID) OF 0.5, BUT WHETHER THE MEAN CHANGES EXCEEDED THE MCID FOR ASTHMA SYMPTOMS IS UNCERTAIN DUE TO THE LACK OF AN ESTABLISHED MCID IN THE SEVERITY SCORES USED IN THE INCLUDED STUDIES. THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CHANGE FROM BASELINE FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN ONE SECOND (MD 0.04 LITRES, 95% CI -0.10 TO 0.19; 7 STUDIES; 340 PARTICIPANTS; I(2) = 68%) WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. TWO STUDIES INDICATED IMPROVED ASTHMA CONTROL, BUT DUE TO VERY SIGNIFICANT HETEROGENEITY (I(2) = 98%) WE DID NOT POOL DATA. NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA WERE REPORTED, BUT THE DATA ON THIS OUTCOME WAS LIMITED. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: WE FOUND MODERATE-QUALITY EVIDENCE THAT YOGA PROBABLY LEADS TO SMALL IMPROVEMENTS IN QUALITY OF LIFE AND SYMPTOMS IN PEOPLE WITH ASTHMA. THERE IS MORE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND ITS IMPACT ON LUNG FUNCTION AND MEDICATION USAGE. RCTS WITH A LARGE SAMPLE SIZE AND HIGH METHODOLOGICAL AND REPORTING QUALITY ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM THE EFFECTS OF YOGA FOR ASTHMA.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
10 2181  65 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING AND HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN OLDER ADULTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVE: THE GOAL WAS TO REVIEW SYSTEMATICALLY THE COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA, COMPARED WITH OTHER EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS, FOR OLDER ADULTS AS SHOWN ON MEASURES OF HEALTH AND PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING. DESIGN: THIS WAS A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WITH BOTH NARRATIVE SYNTHESIS AND META-ANALYSIS. DATA SOURCES: SEARCHES WERE CONDUCTED IN MEDLINE(R)/PUBMED, PSYCINFO, CINAHL, WEB OF SCIENCE, AND SCOPUS; BIBLIOGRAPHIES OF SELECTED ARTICLES; AND ONE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. METHODS: ORIGINAL STUDIES FROM 1950 TO NOVEMBER 2010 WERE SOUGHT, EVALUATING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON OLDER ADULTS. THE SEARCH WAS RESTRICTED TO RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS OF YOGA IN SUBJECTS >/=AGE 60, AND PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH. DATA WERE EXTRACTED AND EVALUATED REGARDING SETTING, POPULATION SIZE AND CHARACTERISTICS, INTERVENTION TYPE AND DURATION, COMPARISON GROUP, OUTCOME ASSESSMENT, DATA ANALYSIS, FOLLOW-UP, KEY RESULTS, AND THE QUALITY OF EACH STUDY ACCORDING TO SPECIFIC PREDETERMINED CRITERIA. RESULTS: THE SEARCH YIELDED 18 ELIGIBLE STUDIES (N=649). THE STUDIES REPORTED ON OLDER ADULTS ACROSS A RANGE OF SETTINGS, INTERVENTION INTENSITY, AND OUTCOME MEASURES. THE MAJORITY OF THE STUDIES HAD<35 PARTICIPANTS (RANGE 9-77). QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE SYNTHESIS OF THE STUDIES SUGGESTED THAT THE BENEFITS OF YOGA MAY EXCEED THOSE OF CONVENTIONAL EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS FOR SELF-RATED HEALTH STATUS, AEROBIC FITNESS, AND STRENGTH. HOWEVER, THE EFFECT SIZES WERE MODEST, AND THE EVIDENCE WAS MIXED FOR YOGA'S EFFECT ON DEPRESSION, SLEEP, AND BONE-MINERAL DENSITY. STUDIES DID NOT FIND AN EFFECT ON COGNITION. CONCLUSIONS: SMALL STUDIES WITH MIXED METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY SUGGESTED THAT YOGA MAY BE SUPERIOR TO CONVENTIONAL PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY INTERVENTIONS IN ELDERLY PEOPLE. THE PRECISION OF THE ESTIMATES REMAINS LOW. LARGER STUDIES ARE NECESSARY TO DEFINE BETTER THE INTERSECTION OF POPULATIONS, SETTINGS, AND INTERVENTIONS IN WHICH YOGA IS MOST BENEFICIAL.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
11 2130  47 THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA TO PREVENT DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2: A PROTOCOL FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM) IS BECOMING A LEADING PROBLEM WORLDWIDE. EMERGING REPORTS REVEAL ALARMING EVIDENCE OF INCREASING PREVALENCE OF T2DM THAT HAS REACHED PANDEMIC LEVELS. DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT INCIDENCE, THERE ARE LIMITED RELIABLE DATA RESOURCES AND COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PEOPLE WHO ARE A PREDIABETIC OR HIGH RISK FOR DEVELOPING T2DM. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROTOCOL IS TO CONDUCT A FULL-SCALE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSES ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PEOPLE WHO ARE PREDIABETES OR HIGH RISK OF DEVELOPING T2DM. METHODS: THE ARTICLES ENROLLED IN THE STUDY WILL BE RETRIEVED FROM THE ONLINE DATABASES BETWEEN 2002 AND THE DATE THE SEARCHES ARE EXECUTED. THE SEARCHES WILL BE REPEATED JUST BEFORE THE FINAL ANALYSES AND FURTHER RELEVANT STUDIES FOR INCLUSION. WE WILL CONDUCT A BIBLIOGRAPHIC SEARCH IN DATABASES: MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, COCHRANE LIBRARY, EBSCO, AND INDMED USING KEYWORDS INCLUDING PREDIABETES STATE, HIGH RISK FOR DIABETES, METABOLIC SYNDROME, AND YOGA. A DEFINED SEARCH STRATEGY WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ALONG WITH SELECTION CRITERIA TO OBTAIN FULL-TEXT ARTICLES OF RELEVANT STUDIES. THIS STUDY PROTOCOL WAS PREPARED ACCORDING TO THE PREFERRED REPORTING ITEMS FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND META-ANALYSIS FOR PROTOCOLS 2015 GUIDELINES. THERE WILL BE NO LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL BE BASED ON PUBLISHED STUDIES AND PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ANONYMIZED DATA WITHOUT DIRECTLY INVOLVING HUMAN PARTICIPANTS AND THEREFORE REQUIRES NEITHER FORMAL HUMAN ETHICAL REVIEW NOR APPROVAL BY A HUMAN RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEE. WE PUBLISHED AN OUTLINE OF THE PROTOCOL IN THE INTERNATIONAL PROSPECTIVE REGISTER OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS (PROSPERO) IN 2018. WE PLAN TO DISSEMINATE THE FINDINGS OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS THROUGH PUBLICATION IN A PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL AND PRESENTATION AT RELEVANT CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS. IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE THE RESULTS OF THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WILL HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND PRACTICE. WE WILL PREPARE POLICYMAKER SUMMARY USING A VALIDATED FORMAT, DISSEMINATE THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA AND EMAIL DISCUSSION GROUPS.

12 2860  40 YOGA-BASED EXERCISE IMPROVES HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE AND MENTAL WELL-BEING IN OLDER PEOPLE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS. OBJECTIVE: HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) AND MENTAL WELL-BEING ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HEALTHY AGEING. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY POSITIVELY IMPACTS BOTH HRQOL AND MENTAL WELL-BEING. YOGA IS A PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THAT CAN BE MODIFIED TO SUITS THE NEEDS OF OLDER PEOPLE AND IS GROWING IN POPULARITY. WE CONDUCTED A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WITH META-ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF YOGA-BASED EXERCISE ON HRQOL AND MENTAL WELL-BEING IN PEOPLE AGED 60+. METHODS: SEARCHES WERE CONDUCTED FOR RELEVANT TRIALS IN THE FOLLOWING ELECTRONIC DATABASES; MEDLINE, EMBASE, COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS, CINAHL, ALLIED AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE DATABASE, PSYCINFO AND THE PHYSIOTHERAPY EVIDENCE DATABASE (PEDRO) FROM INCEPTION TO JANUARY 2017. TRIALS THAT EVALUATED THE EFFECT OF PHYSICAL YOGA ON HRQOL AND/OR ON MENTAL WELL-BEING IN PEOPLE AGED 60+ YEARS WERE INCLUDED. DATA ON HRQOL AND MENTAL WELL-BEING WERE EXTRACTED. STANDARDISED MEAN DIFFERENCES AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CI) WERE CALCULATED USING RANDOM EFFECTS MODELS. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF TRIALS WAS ASSESSED USING THE PEDRO SCALE. RESULTS: TWELVE TRIALS OF HIGH METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY (MEAN PEDRO SCORE 6.1), TOTALLING 752 PARTICIPANTS, WERE IDENTIFIED AND PROVIDED DATA FOR THE META-ANALYSIS. YOGA PRODUCED A MEDIUM EFFECT ON HRQOL (HEDGES' G = 0.51, 95% CI 0.25-0.76, 12 TRIALS) AND A SMALL EFFECT ON MENTAL WELL-BEING (HEDGES' G = 0.38, 95% CI 0.15-0.62, 12 TRIALS). CONCLUSION: YOGA INTERVENTIONS RESULTED IN SMALL TO MODERATE IMPROVEMENTS IN BOTH HRQOL AND MENTAL WELL-BEING IN PEOPLE AGED 60+ YEARS. FURTHER, RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMAL DOSE OF YOGA TO MAXIMISE HEALTH IMPACT.

13 2821  66 YOGA TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC NON-SPECIFIC LOW BACK PAIN. BACKGROUND: NON-SPECIFIC LOW BACK PAIN IS A COMMON, POTENTIALLY DISABLING CONDITION USUALLY TREATED WITH SELF-CARE AND NON-PRESCRIPTION MEDICATION. FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN, CURRENT GUIDELINES STATE THAT EXERCISE THERAPY MAY BE BENEFICIAL. YOGA IS A MIND-BODY EXERCISE SOMETIMES USED FOR NON-SPECIFIC LOW BACK PAIN. OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA FOR TREATING CHRONIC NON-SPECIFIC LOW BACK PAIN, COMPARED TO NO SPECIFIC TREATMENT, A MINIMAL INTERVENTION (E.G. EDUCATION), OR ANOTHER ACTIVE TREATMENT, WITH A FOCUS ON PAIN, FUNCTION, AND ADVERSE EVENTS. SEARCH METHODS: WE SEARCHED CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, FIVE OTHER DATABASES AND FOUR TRIALS REGISTERS TO 11 MARCH 2016 WITHOUT RESTRICTION OF LANGUAGE OR PUBLICATION STATUS. WE SCREENED REFERENCE LISTS AND CONTACTED EXPERTS IN THE FIELD TO IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL STUDIES. SELECTION CRITERIA: WE INCLUDED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS OF YOGA TREATMENT IN PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC NON-SPECIFIC LOW BACK PAIN. WE INCLUDED STUDIES COMPARING YOGA TO ANY OTHER INTERVENTION OR TO NO INTERVENTION. WE ALSO INCLUDED STUDIES COMPARING YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT TO OTHER THERAPIES, VERSUS THOSE OTHER THERAPIES ALONE. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: TWO AUTHORS INDEPENDENTLY SCREENED AND SELECTED STUDIES, EXTRACTED OUTCOME DATA, AND ASSESSED RISK OF BIAS. WE CONTACTED STUDY AUTHORS TO OBTAIN MISSING OR UNCLEAR INFORMATION. WE EVALUATED THE OVERALL CERTAINTY OF EVIDENCE USING THE GRADE APPROACH. MAIN RESULTS: WE INCLUDED 12 TRIALS (1080 PARTICIPANTS) CARRIED OUT IN THE USA (SEVEN TRIALS), INDIA (THREE TRIALS), AND THE UK (TWO TRIALS). STUDIES WERE UNFUNDED (ONE TRIAL), FUNDED BY A YOGA INSTITUTION (ONE TRIAL), FUNDED BY NON-PROFIT OR GOVERNMENT SOURCES (SEVEN TRIALS), OR DID NOT REPORT ON FUNDING (THREE TRIALS). MOST TRIALS USED IYENGAR, HATHA, OR VINIYOGA FORMS OF YOGA. THE TRIALS COMPARED YOGA TO NO INTERVENTION OR A NON-EXERCISE INTERVENTION SUCH AS EDUCATION (SEVEN TRIALS), AN EXERCISE INTERVENTION (THREE TRIALS), OR BOTH EXERCISE AND NON-EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS (TWO TRIALS). ALL TRIALS WERE AT HIGH RISK OF PERFORMANCE AND DETECTION BIAS BECAUSE PARTICIPANTS AND PROVIDERS WERE NOT BLINDED TO TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT, AND OUTCOMES WERE SELF-ASSESSED. THEREFORE, WE DOWNGRADED ALL OUTCOMES TO 'MODERATE' CERTAINTY EVIDENCE BECAUSE OF RISK OF BIAS, AND WHEN THERE WAS ADDITIONAL SERIOUS RISK OF BIAS, UNEXPLAINED HETEROGENEITY BETWEEN STUDIES, OR THE ANALYSES WERE IMPRECISE, WE DOWNGRADED THE CERTAINTY OF THE EVIDENCE FURTHER.FOR YOGA COMPARED TO NON-EXERCISE CONTROLS (9 TRIALS; 810 PARTICIPANTS), THERE WAS LOW-CERTAINTY EVIDENCE THAT YOGA PRODUCED SMALL TO MODERATE IMPROVEMENTS IN BACK-RELATED FUNCTION AT THREE TO FOUR MONTHS (STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE (SMD) -0.40, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) -0.66 TO -0.14; CORRESPONDING TO A CHANGE IN THE ROLAND-MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE OF MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) -2.18, 95% -3.60 TO -0.76), MODERATE-CERTAINTY EVIDENCE FOR SMALL TO MODERATE IMPROVEMENTS AT SIX MONTHS (SMD -0.44, 95% CI -0.66 TO -0.22; CORRESPONDING TO A CHANGE IN THE ROLAND-MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE OF MD -2.15, 95% -3.23 TO -1.08), AND LOW-CERTAINTY EVIDENCE FOR SMALL IMPROVEMENTS AT 12 MONTHS (SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.46 TO -0.05; CORRESPONDING TO A CHANGE IN THE ROLAND-MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE OF MD -1.36, 95% -2.41 TO -0.26). ON A 0-100 SCALE THERE WAS VERY LOW- TO MODERATE-CERTAINTY EVIDENCE THAT YOGA WAS SLIGHTLY BETTER FOR PAIN AT THREE TO FOUR MONTHS (MD -4.55, 95% CI -7.04 TO -2.06), SIX MONTHS (MD -7.81, 95% CI -13.37 TO -2.25), AND 12 MONTHS (MD -5.40, 95% CI -14.50 TO -3.70), HOWEVER WE PRE-DEFINED CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PAIN AS 15 POINTS OR GREATER AND THIS THRESHOLD WAS NOT MET. BASED ON INFORMATION FROM SIX TRIALS, THERE WAS MODERATE-CERTAINTY EVIDENCE THAT THE RISK OF ADVERSE EVENTS, PRIMARILY INCREASED BACK PAIN, WAS HIGHER IN YOGA THAN IN NON-EXERCISE CONTROLS (RISK DIFFERENCE (RD) 5%, 95% CI 2% TO 8%).FOR YOGA COMPARED TO NON-YOGA EXERCISE CONTROLS (4 TRIALS; 394 PARTICIPANTS), THERE WAS VERY-LOW-CERTAINTY EVIDENCE FOR LITTLE OR NO DIFFERENCE IN BACK-RELATED FUNCTION AT THREE MONTHS (SMD -0.22, 95% CI -0.65 TO 0.20; CORRESPONDING TO A CHANGE IN THE ROLAND-MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE OF MD -0.99, 95% -2.87 TO 0.90) AND SIX MONTHS (SMD -0.20, 95% CI -0.59 TO 0.19; CORRESPONDING TO A CHANGE IN THE ROLAND-MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE OF MD -0.90, 95% -2.61 TO 0.81), AND NO INFORMATION ON BACK-RELATED FUNCTION AFTER SIX MONTHS. THERE WAS VERY LOW-CERTAINTY EVIDENCE FOR LOWER PAIN ON A 0-100 SCALE AT SEVEN MONTHS (MD -20.40, 95% CI -25.48 TO -15.32), AND NO INFORMATION ON PAIN AT THREE MONTHS OR AFTER SEVEN MONTHS. BASED ON INFORMATION FROM THREE TRIALS, THERE WAS LOW-CERTAINTY EVIDENCE FOR NO DIFFERENCE IN THE RISK OF ADVERSE EVENTS BETWEEN YOGA AND NON-YOGA EXERCISE CONTROLS (RD 1%, 95% CI -4% TO 6%).FOR YOGA ADDED TO EXERCISE COMPARED TO EXERCISE ALONE (1 TRIAL; 24 PARTICIPANTS), THERE WAS VERY-LOW-CERTAINTY EVIDENCE FOR LITTLE OR NO DIFFERENCE AT 10 WEEKS IN BACK-RELATED FUNCTION (SMD -0.60, 95% CI -1.42 TO 0.22; CORRESPONDING TO A CHANGE IN THE OSWESTRY DISABILITY INDEX OF MD -17.05, 95% -22.96 TO 11.14) OR PAIN ON A 0-100 SCALE (MD -3.20, 95% CI -13.76 TO 7.36). THERE WAS NO INFORMATION ON OUTCOMES AT OTHER TIME POINTS. THERE WAS NO INFORMATION ON ADVERSE EVENTS.STUDIES PROVIDED LIMITED EVIDENCE ON RISK OF CLINICAL IMPROVEMENT, MEASURES OF QUALITY OF LIFE, AND DEPRESSION. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE ON WORK-RELATED DISABILITY. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: THERE IS LOW- TO MODERATE-CERTAINTY EVIDENCE THAT YOGA COMPARED TO NON-EXERCISE CONTROLS RESULTS IN SMALL TO MODERATE IMPROVEMENTS IN BACK-RELATED FUNCTION AT THREE AND SIX MONTHS. YOGA MAY ALSO BE SLIGHTLY MORE EFFECTIVE FOR PAIN AT THREE AND SIX MONTHS, HOWEVER THE EFFECT SIZE DID NOT MEET PREDEFINED LEVELS OF MINIMUM CLINICAL IMPORTANCE. IT IS UNCERTAIN WHETHER THERE IS ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOGA AND OTHER EXERCISE FOR BACK-RELATED FUNCTION OR PAIN, OR WHETHER YOGA ADDED TO EXERCISE IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN EXERCISE ALONE. YOGA IS ASSOCIATED WITH MORE ADVERSE EVENTS THAN NON-EXERCISE CONTROLS, BUT MAY HAVE THE SAME RISK OF ADVERSE EVENTS AS OTHER BACK-FOCUSED EXERCISE. YOGA IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS. THERE IS A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL HIGH-QUALITY RESEARCH TO IMPROVE CONFIDENCE IN ESTIMATES OF EFFECT, TO EVALUATE LONG-TERM OUTCOMES, AND TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON COMPARISONS BETWEEN YOGA AND OTHER EXERCISE FOR CHRONIC NON-SPECIFIC LOW BACK PAIN.	2017	

14 1202  46 EXERCISE, YOGA, AND TAI CHI FOR TREATMENT OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER IN OUTPATIENT SETTINGS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVE: EXERCISE, YOGA, AND TAI CHI ARE COMMONLY USED COMPLEMENTARY APPROACHES FOR HEALTH AND WELLNESS. THIS REVIEW AIMS TO SYNTHESIZE THE EVIDENCE FOR EXERCISE, YOGA, AND TAI CHI IN THE OUTPATIENT TREATMENT OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER. STUDY SELECTION: A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH OF THE OVID MEDLINE, EMBASE, PSYCINFO, AND COCHRANE DATABASES WAS CONDUCTED FOR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS OF EXERCISE, YOGA, AND TAI CHI FOR MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER. DATA EXTRACTION: STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCES WERE CALCULATED AND META-ANALYZED USING A RANDOM EFFECTS MULTILEVEL MODELING FRAMEWORK. HETEROGENEITY AND SUBGROUP ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED. RESULTS: TWENTY-FIVE STUDIES WERE INCLUDED FOR FINAL ANALYSIS (EXERCISE: 15, YOGA: 7, TAI CHI: 3). OVERALL, META-ANALYSIS SHOWED A MODERATE SIGNIFICANT CLINICAL EFFECT. HOWEVER, WHEN ONLY STUDIES (6 STUDIES) WITH THE LOWEST RISK OF BIAS WERE INCLUDED, THE OVERALL EFFECT SIZE WAS REDUCED TO LOW TO MODERATE EFFICACY. OVERALL QUALITY OF EVIDENCE WAS LOW. HETEROGENEITY AND PUBLICATION BIAS WERE HIGH. CONCLUSIONS: THE CURRENT META-ANALYSIS OF OUTPATIENT EXERCISE, YOGA, AND TAI CHI FOR TREATMENT OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER SUGGESTS THAT ADJUNCTIVE EXERCISE AND YOGA MAY HAVE SMALL ADDITIVE CLINICAL EFFECTS IN COMPARISON TO CONTROL FOR REDUCING DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. THE EVIDENCE FOR TAI CHI IS INSUFFICIENT TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS. THE CONCERNS WITH QUALITY OF STUDIES, HIGH HETEROGENEITY, AND EVIDENCE OF PUBLICATION BIAS PRECLUDE MAKING FIRM CONCLUSIONS.	2020

15  615  37 DEVELOPMENT OF AN INDIVIDUALIZED YOGA INTERVENTION TO ADDRESS FATIGUE IN HOSPITALIZED CHILDREN UNDERGOING INTENSIVE CHEMOTHERAPY. PURPOSE FATIGUE IS AN IMPORTANT PROBLEM IN CHILDREN RECEIVING INTENSIVE CHEMOTHERAPY AND HEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION (HSCT). EXERCISE MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR FATIGUE. INDIVIDUALIZED YOGA REPRESENTS AN IDEAL INTERVENTION BECAUSE IT CAN BE TAILORED ACCORDING TO AN INDIVIDUAL CHILD'S NEEDS. LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW TO STRUCTURE A STANDARDIZED YOGA PROGRAM FOR INTENSIVELYTREATED CHILDREN. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A YOGA PROGRAM AND AN APPROACH TO MONITORING SESSIONS SUITABLE FOR HOSPITALIZED CHILDREN RECEIVING INTENSIVE CHEMOTHERAPY OR HSCT. METHODS THE YOGA PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED TO INCREASE MOBILITY IN HOSPITALIZED CHILDREN AND TO PROVIDE CHILDREN WITH RELAXATION TECHNIQUES THAT COULD BE USED INDEPENDENTLY IN A VARIETY OF ENVIRONMENTS. THE PROGRAM WAS FOUNDED ON 4 KEY TENETS: SAFETY, ADAPTABILITY, ENVIRONMENTAL FLEXIBILITY, AND APPEAL TO CHILDREN. WE ALSO DEVELOPED QUALITY AND CONSISTENCY ASSURANCE PROCEDURES. RESULTS A MENU FORMAT WITH A FIXED STRUCTURE WAS SELECTED FOR THE YOGA PROGRAM. EACH YOGA SESSION CONTAINED UP TO 6 SECTIONS: BREATHING EXERCISES, WARMUP EXERCISES, YOGA POSES, BALANCING POSES, COOL-DOWN POSES, AND FINAL RELAXATION. YOGA INSTRUCTORS SELECTED SPECIFIC YOGA POSES FOR EACH SESSION FROM A PREDETERMINED LIST ORGANIZED BY INTENSITY LEVEL (LOW, MODERATE, OR HIGH). MONITORING PROCEDURES WERE DEVELOPED USING VIDEOTAPING AND MULTIRATER ADJUDICATION. CONCLUSION WE CREATED A STANDARDIZED YOGA PROGRAM AND AN APPROACH TO MONITORING THAT ARE NOW READY FOR INCORPORATION IN CLINICAL TRIALS. FUTURE WORK SHOULD INCLUDE THE ADAPTATION OF THE PROGRAM TO DIFFERENT PEDIATRIC POPULATIONS AND CLINICAL SETTINGS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
16 1661  61 NARRATIVE REVIEW OF YOGA INTERVENTION CLINICAL TRIALS INCLUDING WEIGHT-RELATED OUTCOMES. CONTEXT: MEDICAL AUTHORITIES HAVE IDENTIFIED OBESITY AS A CAUSAL FACTOR IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIABETES, HYPERTENSION, AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (CVD), AND MORE BROADLY, OF METABOLIC SYNDROME/INSULIN RESISTANCE SYNDROME. TO PROVIDE SOLUTIONS THAT CAN MODIFY THIS RISK FACTOR, RESEARCHERS NEED TO IDENTIFY METHODS OF EFFECTIVE RISK REDUCTION AND PRIMARY PREVENTION OF OBESITY. RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AS A TREATMENT FOR OBESITY IS LIMITED, AND STUDIES VARY IN OVERALL QUALITY AND METHODOLOGICAL RIGOR. OBJECTIVE: THIS NARRATIVE REVIEW ASSESSED THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF CLINICAL TRIALS OF YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR WEIGHT LOSS OR AS A MEANS OF RISK REDUCTION OR TREATMENT FOR OBESITY AND DISEASES IN WHICH OBESITY IS A CAUSAL FACTOR. THIS REVIEW SUMMARIZED THE STUDIES' RESEARCH DESIGNS AND EVALUATED THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR WEIGHT LOSS VIA THE CURRENT EVIDENCE BASE. DESIGN: THE RESEARCH TEAM EVALUATED PUBLISHED STUDIES TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF RESEARCH DESIGNS, COMPARABILITY OF PROGRAMS' INTERVENTION ELEMENTS, AND STANDARDIZATION OF OUTCOME MEASURES. THE RESEARCH TEAM'S LITERATURE SEARCH USED THE KEY TERMS YOGA AND OBESITY OR YOGA AND WEIGHT LOSS IN THREE PRIMARY MEDICAL-LITERATURE DATABASES (PUBMED, PSYCHINFO, AND WEB OF SCIENCE). THE STUDY EXCLUDED CLINICAL TRIALS WITH NO QUANTITATIVE OBESITY RELATED MEASURE. EXTRACTED DATA INCLUDED EACH STUDY'S (1) DESIGN; (2) SETTING AND POPULATION; (3) NATURE, DURATION, AND FREQUENCY OF INTERVENTIONS; (4) COMPARISON GROUPS; (5) RECRUITMENT STRATEGIES; (6) OUTCOME MEASURES; (7) DATA ANALYSIS AND PRESENTATION; AND (8) RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS. THE RESEARCH TEAM DEVELOPED AN OVERALL EVALUATION PARAMETER TO COMPARE DISPARATE TRIALS. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE RESEARCH TEAM REVIEWED EACH STUDY TO DETERMINE ITS KEY FEATURES, EACH WORTH A SPECIFIED NUMBER OF POINTS, WITH A MAXIMUM TOTAL OF 20 POINTS. THE FEATURES INCLUDED A STUDY'S (1) DURATION, (2) FREQUENCY OF YOGA PRACTICE, (3) INTENSITY OF (LENGTH OF) EACH PRACTICE, (4) NUMBER OF YOGIC ELEMENTS, (5) INCLUSION OF DIETARY MODIFICATION, (6) INCLUSION OF A RESIDENTIAL COMPONENT, (7) THE NUMBER OF WEIGHT-RELATED OUTCOME MEASURES, AND (8) A DISCUSSION OF THE DETAILS OF THE YOGIC ELEMENTS. RESULTS: OVERALL, THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAMS ARE FREQUENTLY EFFECTIVE IN PROMOTING WEIGHT LOSS AND/OR IMPROVEMENTS IN BODY COMPOSITION. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR WEIGHT LOSS IS RELATED TO THE FOLLOWING KEY FEATURES: (1) AN INCREASED FREQUENCY OF PRACTICE; (2) A LONGER INTERVENTION DURATION (3) A YOGIC DIETARY COMPONENT; (4) A RESIDENTIAL COMPONENT; (5) THE COMPREHENSIVE INCLUSION OF YOGIC COMPONENTS; (5) AND A HOME-PRACTICE COMPONENT. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA APPEARS TO BE AN APPROPRIATE AND POTENTIALLY SUCCESSFUL INTERVENTION FOR WEIGHT MAINTENANCE, PREVENTION OF OBESITY, AND RISK REDUCTION FOR DISEASES IN WHICH OBESITY PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT CAUSAL ROLE.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
17 2859  40 YOGA-BASED EXERCISE IMPROVES BALANCE AND MOBILITY IN PEOPLE AGED 60 AND OVER: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVE: ONE-THIRD OF COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS FALL ANNUALLY. EXERCISE THAT CHALLENGES BALANCE IS PROVEN TO PREVENT FALLS. WE CONDUCTED A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WITH META-ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF YOGA-BASED EXERCISE ON BALANCE AND PHYSICAL MOBILITY IN PEOPLE AGED 60+ YEARS. METHODS: SEARCHES FOR RELEVANT TRIALS WERE CONDUCTED ON THE FOLLOWING ELECTRONIC DATABASES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS, CINAHL, ALLIED AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE DATABASE AND THE PHYSIOTHERAPY EVIDENCE DATABASE (PEDRO) FROM INCEPTION TO FEBRUARY 2015. TRIALS WERE INCLUDED IF THEY EVALUATED THE EFFECT OF PHYSICAL YOGA (EXCLUDING MEDITATION AND BREATHING EXERCISES ALONE) ON BALANCE IN PEOPLE AGED 60+ YEARS. WE EXTRACTED DATA ON BALANCE AND THE SECONDARY OUTCOME OF PHYSICAL MOBILITY. STANDARDISED MEAN DIFFERENCES AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CI) WERE CALCULATED USING RANDOM-EFFECTS MODELS. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF TRIALS WAS ASSESSED USING THE 10-POINT PHYSIOTHERAPY EVIDENCE DATABASE (PEDRO) SCALE. RESULTS: SIX TRIALS OF RELATIVELY HIGH METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY, TOTALLING 307 PARTICIPANTS, WERE IDENTIFIED AND HAD DATA THAT COULD BE INCLUDED IN A META-ANALYSIS. OVERALL, YOGA INTERVENTIONS HAD A SMALL EFFECT ON BALANCE PERFORMANCE (HEDGES' G = 0.40, 95% CI 0.15-0.65, 6 TRIALS) AND A MEDIUM EFFECT ON PHYSICAL MOBILITY (HEDGES' G = 0.50, 95% CI 0.06-0.95, 3 TRIALS). CONCLUSION: YOGA INTERVENTIONS RESULTED IN SMALL IMPROVEMENTS IN BALANCE AND MEDIUM IMPROVEMENTS IN PHYSICAL MOBILITY IN PEOPLE AGED 60+ YEARS. FURTHER RESEARCH IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOGA-RELATED IMPROVEMENTS IN BALANCE AND MOBILITY TRANSLATE TO PREVENTION OF FALLS IN OLDER PEOPLE.

18  236  51 A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW: THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PREGNANCY. OBJECTIVE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED TO UPDATE AND PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF ANTENATAL YOGA ON PREGNANCY COMPARED TO STANDARD PRENATAL CARE. STUDY DESIGN: FOUR DATABASES WERE SEARCHED USING KEYWORDS "YOGA", "PREGNANCY", "PERINATAL CARE", "PRENATAL CARE", "POSTNATAL CARE", "POSTPARTUM PERIOD", "PERIPARTUM PERIOD", "PATIENT OUTCOME ASSESSMENT", "OUTCOME ASSESSMENT", "PREGNANCY OUTCOME", "TREATMENT OUTCOME". TRIALS WERE CONSIDERED IF THEY WERE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) PUBLISHED FROM 2011 TO 2018 AND EVALUATED AN ANTENATAL YOGA INTERVENTION. ALL STUDIES WERE ASSESSED FOR RISK OF BIAS USING THE COCHRANE CRITERIA. TRIAL CHARACTERISTICS AND OUTCOMES WERE EXTRACTED AND SYNTHESIZED DESCRIPTIVELY WHERE POSSIBLE. DUE TO HETEROGENEITY, META-ANALYSIS WAS NOT POSSIBLE. RESULTS: OF THE 175 NON-DUPLICATED STUDIES, 16 MET CRITERIA FOR FULL-TEXT REVIEW. FIVE RCTS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA AND WERE INCLUDED IN THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. THE FINDINGS OF THE RCTS SUGGEST ANTENATAL YOGA MAY BE SAFE AND MAY EFFECTIVELY DECREASE STRESS LEVELS, ANXIETY SCORES, DEPRESSION SCORES, AND PAIN RESPONSE AS WELL AS INCREASING MATERNAL IMMUNITY AND EMOTIONAL-WELLBEING. CONCLUSION: YOGA APPEARS TO BE SAFE AND MAY IMPROVE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PREGNANCY OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE LIMITED NUMBER OF STUDIES, MORE HIGH-QUALITY, LARGE RCTS ARE NEEDED TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS ABOUT IMPROVEMENT IN OTHER PREGNANCY OUTCOMES.	2020

19 1064  41 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON IMMUNE FUNCTION: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. OBJECTIVE: THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW ATTEMPTS TO CONFIRM THE ADDED EVIDENCE TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON IMMUNE FUNCTION. METHODS: THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, EMBASE, PSYCINFO, PUBMED, AND WEB OF SCIENCE ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE SEARCHED ACCORDING TO THE PRISRMA METHOD TO IDENTIFY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) ON THE IMMUNOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF YOGA PUBLISHED IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE FROM JANUARY 1, 2017, TO DECEMBER 31, 2020. THIS REVIEW COULD ONLY BE DESCRIPTIVELY SUMMARIZED BECAUSE OF HETEROGENEITY OF THE INCLUDED RCTS. RESULTS: ELEVEN POTENTIAL TRIALS WERE IDENTIFIED AND INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW. QUALITY APPRAISAL OF INCLUDED TRIALS RANGED FROM 3 FOR UNCLEAR RISK OF BIAS AND 8 FOR HIGH RISK OF BIAS. THERE IS EVIDENCE FROM 11 RCTS THAT YOGA MAY HAVE FAVORABLE EFFECTS FOR REDUCING THE LEVELS OF ANTI-INFLAMMATORY MARKERS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA MAY BE USED AS A COMPLEMENTARY INTERVENTION FOR CLINICAL POPULATIONS OR HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS.	2021

20 2829  60 YOGA VERSUS STANDARD CARE FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS AN ANCIENT SPIRITUAL PRACTICE THAT ORIGINATED IN INDIA AND IS CURRENTLY ACCEPTED IN THE WESTERN WORLD AS A FORM OF RELAXATION AND EXERCISE. IT HAS BEEN OF INTEREST FOR PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA TO DETERMINE ITS EFFICACY AS AN ADJUNCT TO STANDARD-CARE TREATMENT. OBJECTIVES: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA VERSUS STANDARD CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA. SEARCH METHODS: WE SEARCHED THE COCHRANE SCHIZOPHRENIA GROUP TRIALS REGISTER (NOVEMBER 2012 AND JANUARY 29, 2015), WHICH IS BASED ON REGULAR SEARCHES OF MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PSYCINFO, AND REGISTRIES OF CLINICAL TRIALS. WE SEARCHED THE REFERENCES OF ALL INCLUDED STUDIES. THERE WERE NO LANGUAGE, DATE, DOCUMENT TYPE, OR PUBLICATION STATUS LIMITATIONS FOR INCLUSION OF RECORDS IN THE REGISTER. SELECTION CRITERIA: ALL RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) INCLUDING PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA COMPARING YOGA TO STANDARD-CARE CONTROL. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: THE REVIEW TEAM INDEPENDENTLY SELECTED STUDIES, QUALITY RATED THESE, AND EXTRACTED DATA. FOR BINARY OUTCOMES, WE CALCULATED RISK RATIO (RR) AND ITS 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI), ON AN INTENTION-TO-TREAT BASIS. FOR CONTINUOUS DATA, WE ESTIMATED THE MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) BETWEEN GROUPS AND ITS 95% CI. WE EMPLOYED MIXED-EFFECT AND FIXED-EFFECT MODELS FOR ANALYSES. WE EXAMINED DATA FOR HETEROGENEITY (I(2) TECHNIQUE), ASSESSED RISK OF BIAS FOR INCLUDED STUDIES, AND CREATED 'SUMMARY OF FINDINGS' TABLES USING GRADE (GRADING OF RECOMMENDATIONS ASSESSMENT, DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION). MAIN RESULTS: WE INCLUDED EIGHT STUDIES IN THE REVIEW. ALL OUTCOMES WERE SHORT TERM (LESS THAN SIX MONTHS). THERE WERE CLEAR DIFFERENCES IN A NUMBER OF OUTCOMES IN FAVOUR OF THE YOGA GROUP, ALTHOUGH THESE WERE BASED ON ONE STUDY EACH, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF LEAVING THE STUDY EARLY. THESE INCLUDED MENTAL STATE (IMPROVEMENT IN POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SYNDROME SCALE, 1 RCT, N = 83, RR 0.70 CI 0.55 TO 0.88, MEDIUM-QUALITY EVIDENCE), SOCIAL FUNCTIONING (IMPROVEMENT IN SOCIAL OCCUPATIONAL FUNCTIONING SCALE, 1 RCT, N = 83, RR 0.88 CI 0.77 TO 1, MEDIUM-QUALITY EVIDENCE), QUALITY OF LIFE (AVERAGE CHANGE 36-ITEM SHORT FORM SURVEY (SF-36) QUALITY-OF-LIFE SUBSCALE, 1 RCT, N = 60, MD 15.50, 95% CI 4.27 TO 26.73, LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE), AND LEAVING THE STUDY EARLY (8 RCTS, N = 457, RR 0.91 CI 0.6 TO 1.37, MEDIUM-QUALITY EVIDENCE). FOR THE OUTCOME OF PHYSICAL HEALTH, THERE WAS NOT A CLEAR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS (AVERAGE CHANGE SF-36 PHYSICAL-HEALTH SUBSCALE, 1 RCT, N = 60, MD 6.60, 95% CI -2.44 TO 15.64, LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE). ONLY ONE STUDY REPORTED ADVERSE EFFECTS, FINDING NO INCIDENCE OF ADVERSE EVENTS IN EITHER TREATMENT GROUP. THIS REVIEW WAS SUBJECT TO A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF MISSING OUTCOMES, WHICH INCLUDED GLOBAL STATE, CHANGE IN COGNITION, COSTS OF CARE, EFFECT ON STANDARD CARE, SERVICE INTERVENTION, DISABILITY, AND ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: EVEN THOUGH WE FOUND SOME POSITIVE EVIDENCE IN FAVOUR OF YOGA OVER STANDARD-CARE CONTROL, THIS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED CAUTIOUSLY IN VIEW OF OUTCOMES LARGELY BASED EACH ON ONE STUDY WITH LIMITED SAMPLE SIZES AND SHORT-TERM FOLLOW-UP. OVERALL, MANY OUTCOMES WERE NOT REPORTED AND EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN THIS REVIEW IS OF LOW TO MODERATE QUALITY - -TOO WEAK TO INDICATE THAT YOGA IS SUPERIOR TO STANDARD-CARE CONTROL FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA.	2015

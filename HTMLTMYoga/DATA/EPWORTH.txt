1 2031 158 TAILORED INDIVIDUAL YOGA PRACTICE IMPROVES SLEEP QUALITY, FATIGUE, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION IN CHRONIC INSOMNIA DISORDER. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC INSOMNIA DISORDER (CI) IS A PREVALENT SLEEP DISORDER THAT CAN LEAD TO DISTURBED DAYTIME FUNCTIONING AND IS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. FIRST-CHOICE TREATMENT IS COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT-I). OTHER MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS TAI-CHI AND YOGA, HAVE DEMONSTRATED SUBJECTIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN SLEEP QUALITY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR IMPROVEMENT OF SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE SLEEP QUALITY AS WELL AS MEASURES OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, SLEEPINESS, AND FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH CI. METHODS: ADULTS WITH CI WERE PROSPECTIVELY INCLUDED IN THIS SINGLE GROUP PRE-POST STUDY. BASELINE ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED HOME POLYSOMNOGRAPHY (PSG), 7-DAY ACTIGRAPHY, AND QUESTIONNAIRES (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX QUESTIONNAIRE (PSQI), HOSPITAL ANXIETY DEPRESSION SCALE (HADS), EPWORTH SLEEPINESS SCALE (ESS), PICHOT FATIGUE SCALE (PS)). PATIENTS PRACTICED VINIYOGA, AN INDIVIDUALISED YOGA PRACTICE WITH DAILY SELF-ADMINISTERED EXERCISES, FOR 14 WEEKS. ASSESSMENTS WERE REPEATED AT THE END OF YOGA PRACTICE. RESULTS: TWENTY-ONE PATIENTS COMPLETED THE STUDY. OBJECTIVE SLEEP MEASUREMENTS REVEALED NO CHANGE IN PSG PARAMETERS AFTER YOGA PRACTICE, BUT A DECREASE IN AROUSALS ON ACTIGRAPHY (P < 0.001). SUBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS IMPROVED FOR ALL QUESTIONNAIRES (PSQI, P < 0.001; HAD-A, P = 0.020, HAD-D, P = 0.001, ESS, P = 0.041, PS, P = 0.010). IN UNIVARIATE CORRELATIONS, DECREASE IN PSQI WAS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASE IN SLEEP STAGE N3 (P < 0.001) ON PSG. CONCLUSIONS: WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED A POSITIVE IMPACT OF INDIVIDUALIZED YOGA PRACTICE ON SUBJECTIVE PARAMETERS RELATED TO SLEEP AND DAYTIME SYMPTOMS IN CI, RESULTING IN FEWER AROUSALS ON ACTIGRAPHY. YOGA COULD BE PROPOSED AS A POTENTIALLY USEFUL ALTERNATIVE TO CBT-I IN CI, AS IT IS EASY TO PRACTICE AUTONOMOUSLY OVER THE LONG-TERM. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE DESIGN OF THE PRESENT STUDY, FUTURE PROSPECTIVE CONTROLLED STUDIES SHOULD FIRST CONFIRM OUR RESULTS.

2  761  46 EFFECT OF SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA (SKY) ON DAYTIME AND SITUATIONAL SLEEP PROPENSITY IN NOVICE PRACTITIONERS: A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY. OBJECTIVES: HECTIC, LATE-NIGHT LIFESTYLE HAS REDUCED 90 MIN SLEEP IN 20% ADULTS RESULTING IN INSOMNIA AND EXCESSIVE DAYTIME SLEEPINESS (EDS). WE ASSESS THE SCOPE OF SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA (SKY), A 4-COMPONENT, BREATHING PROCESS IN REDUCING EDS, GENERALLY AND SITUATIONALLY. METHODS: THIS IS A PROSPECTIVE, CONTROLLED STUDY INVOLVING RANDOMIZED SUBJECTS WITHOUT ANY SLEEP-WAKE CYCLE ANOMALIES AND PRIOR EXPERIENCE IN SKY. SUBJECTS (N=52) PERFORMED 30 MIN OF SKY FOR 6 DAYS/WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS, WHILE CONTROLS (N=53) PERFORMED SITTING ACTIVITY AND SURYANAMASKAR FOR 4-WEEKS EACH. EPWORTH SLEEPINESS SCALE (ESS) WAS USED TO MEASURE EDS AT 0, 4, AND 8 WEEKS. RESULTS: SKY GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT ESS SCORE IMPROVEMENTS BETWEEN 0-4 WEEKS AND 4-8 WEEKS OF 1.22 (P=0.0001) AND 1.66 (P=0.001) RESPECTIVELY. CONTROLS HOWEVER FAILED TO IMPROVE WITH SCORE DIFFERENCES OF 0.02 (P=0.892) AND 0.02 (P=0.8212) RESPECTIVELY. SKY GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT ESS SCORE IMPROVEMENT OVER CONTROLS AT 4-WEEKS (DIFFERENCE=1.74; P=0.013) AND 8-WEEKS (DIFFERENCE EIGHT; P=0.0001). IMPROVEMENT WAS MOST FOR OBESE PEOPLE AND THOSE SITTING IN A HALTED CAR. CONCLUSIONS: IMPROVEMENT IN SUBJECTS' NIGHTTIME SLEEP AND DAYTIME WAKEFULNESS IN SKY PRACTITIONERS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO POLYVAGAL THEORY. INCREASED HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) ALTERATIONS AND SYMPATHETIC HYPERAROUSAL IN CHRONIC INSOMNIA; AND CHOLINERGIC AND GABAERGIC DYSREGULATION IN ANXIETY DISORDERS ARE COUNTERED BY REGULATED VAGAL NERVE STIMULATION POST SKY. OUR STUDY ESTABLISHES EFFECTIVITY OF SKY IN REDUCING EDS (TOTAL AND SITUATIONAL), PROVIDES A CLINICAL CORRELATION FOR PRIOR POLYSOMNOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE AND PAVES WAY FOR LARGER TRIALS DIRECTED TOWARDS SKY PRESCRIPTIONS FOR INSOMNIA.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
3 2588  50 YOGA FOR IMPROVING SLEEP QUALITY AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR OLDER ADULTS. CONTEXT: THE AGING PROCESS IS ASSOCIATED WITH PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES THAT AFFECT SLEEP. IN OLDER ADULTS, UNDIAGNOSED AND UNTREATED INSOMNIA MAY CAUSE IMPAIRED DAILY FUNCTION AND REDUCED QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). INSOMNIA IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR ACCIDENTS AND FALLS THAT ARE THE MAIN CAUSE OF ACCIDENTAL DEATHS IN OLDER ADULTS AND, THEREFORE, IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY RATES IN OLDER POPULATIONS. OBJECTIVES: THE RESEARCH TEAM AIMED TO (1) EXAMINE THE EFFICACY OF A YOGA INTERVENTION (YI) FOR THE TREATMENT OF INSOMNIA IN OLDER ADULTS, (2) DETERMINE THE ABILITY OF YOGA TO ENHANCE THE QOL OF OLDER ADULTS, AND (3) ESTABLISH THE APPLICABILITY OF YOGA PRACTICE FOR OLDER PEOPLE IN A WESTERN CULTURAL SETTING. DESIGN: A WAITING-LIST CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTINGS * THE STUDY TOOK PLACE IN JERUSALEM, ISRAEL, FROM 2008-2009. PARTICIPANTS: PARTICIPANTS WERE OLDER MEN AND WOMEN (AGE >/= 60 Y) WITH INSOMNIA. INTERVENTION: THE YI GROUP PARTICIPATED IN 12 WK OF CLASSES, HELD 2 X/WK, INCORPORATING YOGA POSTURES, MEDITATIVE YOGA, AND DAILY HOME PRACTICE OF MEDITATIVE YOGA. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE STUDY USED SELF-REPORT ASSESSMENTS OF SLEEP QUALITY USING THE FOLLOWING: (1) SLEEP QUALITY-THE KAROLINSKA SLEEPINESS SCALE (KSS), THE EPWORTH SLEEPINESS SCALE (ESS), AND THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI), AND DAILY SLEEP AND PRACTICE LOGS; (2) MOOD STATES-THE DEPRESSION ANXIETY STRESS SCALE LONG FORM (DASS-42) AND THE PROFILE OF MOOD STATES SHORT FORM (POMS-SF); (3) A HEALTH SURVEY (SF-36); AND (4) MOBILE AT-HOME SLEEP STUDIES. RESULTS: COMPARED WITH CONTROLS, THE YI GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN A RANGE OF SUBJECTIVE FACTORS, INCLUDING OVERALL SLEEP QUALITY; SLEEP EFFICIENCY; SLEEP LATENCY AND DURATION; SELF-ASSESSED SLEEP QUALITY; FATIGUE; GENERAL WELL-BEING; DEPRESSION; ANXIETY; STRESS; TENSION; ANGER; VITALITY; AND FUNCTION IN PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, AND SOCIAL ROLES. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA WAS SHOWN TO BE SAFE AND IMPROVED SLEEP AND QOL IN A GROUP OF OLDER ADULTS WITH INSOMNIA. OUTCOMES DEPENDED ON PRACTICE COMPLIANCE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
4  117  49 A PILOT STUDY OF GENTLE YOGA FOR SLEEP DISTURBANCE IN WOMEN WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS. OBJECTIVES: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO TEST THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF A GENTLE YOGA INTERVENTION FOR SLEEP DISTURBANCE IN OLDER WOMEN WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) AND TO COLLECT INITIAL EFFICACY DATA ON THE INTERVENTION. METHODS: ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED AN 8-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM THAT INCLUDED 75-MIN WEEKLY CLASSES AND 20 MIN OF NIGHTLY HOME PRACTICE. PARTICIPANTS WERE WOMEN WITH OA AND SYMPTOMS CONSISTENT WITH INSOMNIA. SYMPTOM QUESTIONNAIRES AND 1 WEEK OF WRIST ACTIGRAPHY AND SLEEP DIARIES WERE COMPLETED FOR 1 WEEK PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION. RESULTS: FOURTEEN WOMEN WERE ENROLLED OF WHOM 13 COMPLETED THE STUDY (MEAN AGE 65.2 +/- 6.9 YEARS). PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED A MEAN OF 7.2 +/- 1.0 CLASSES AND PRACTICED AT HOME 5.83 +/- 1.66 NIGHTS/WEEK. THE INSOMNIA SEVERITY INDEX AND DIARY-REPORTED SLEEP ONSET LATENCY, SLEEP EFFICIENCY, AND NUMBER OF NIGHTS WITH INSOMNIA WERE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED AT POST-INTERVENTION VERSUS PRE-INTERVENTION (P < .05). OTHER SLEEP OUTCOMES (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX, EPWORTH SLEEPINESS SCALE, DIARY-REPORTED TOTAL SLEEP TIME AND WAKE AFTER SLEEP ONSET) SHOWED IMPROVEMENT ON MEAN SCORES AT POST-INTERVENTION, BUT THESE WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. ACTIGRAPHIC SLEEP OUTCOMES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY SUPPORTS THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF A STANDARDIZED EVENING YOGA PRACTICE FOR MIDDLE-AGED TO OLDER WOMEN WITH OA. PRELIMINARY EFFICACY FINDINGS SUPPORT FURTHER RESEARCH ON THIS PROGRAM AS A POTENTIAL TREATMENT OPTION FOR OA-RELATED INSOMNIA.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
5  911  39 EFFECTIVENESS OF INTEGRATIVE RESTORATION (IREST) YOGA NIDRA ON MINDFULNESS, SLEEP, AND PAIN IN HEALTH CARE WORKERS. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTEGRATIVE RESTORATION (IREST) YOGA NIDRA MEDITATION ON MINDFULNESS, SLEEP, AND PAIN IN HEALTH CARE WORKERS. AS HEALTH CARE WORKERS PROVIDE EMOTIONAL SUPPORT TO PATIENTS, IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR WORKERS TO EXPERIENCE BOTH PHYSICAL AND MENTAL EXHAUSTION. ONE HOLISTIC APPROACH TO SUPPORT EMPLOYEES IS MINDFULNESS TRAINING. IREST YOGA NIDRA IS A COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH THERAPY THAT INCREASES MINDFULNESS. A PRE-/POSTINTERVENITON DESCRIPTIVE SURVEY DESIGN WAS USED. BEFORE AND AFTER EXPERIENCING IREST MEDITATION, PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED A 51-ITEM QUESTIONNAIRE CONSISTING OF DEMOGRAPHICS PLUS 3 VALIDATED INSTRUMENTS: THE FIVE-FACET MINDFULNESS QUESTIONNAIRE (FFMQ), THE EPWORTH SLEEPINESS SCALE (ESS), AND DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE/VETERANS ADMINISTRATION (DOD/VA) PAIN SUPPLEMENTAL QUESTIONS (PSQ). A TOTAL OF 15 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED BOTH QUESTIONNAIRES. POSTINTERVENTION FFMQ SCORES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN PREINTERVENTION (Z = -3.294, P = .001). THE HIGHEST SUBSCALE SCORES WERE "ACTING WITH AWARENESS" AND "NONJUDGING OF INNER EXPERIENCE." THERE WAS A NOT A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE MEAN ESS SCORES AT BASELINE AND FOLLOW-UP. HOWEVER, THERE WAS A STRONG NEGATIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE MEAN ESS IMPROVEMENT SCORE AND THE NUMBER OF WEEKS ATTENDED (RS = -0.705, P = .003). THERE WAS A NOT A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE MEAN PAIN BASELINE AND FOLLOW-UP SCORES. THIS STUDY SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN MINDFULNESS OF HEALTH CARE WORKERS FOLLOWING A GUIDED 8-WEEK IREST YOGA NIDRA PROGRAM. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY MAY PROVIDE SOME INSIGHT INTO HELPING HEALTH CARE WORKERS DEAL WITH THE DEMANDS OF THEIR PROFESSION IN A POSITIVE MANNER, THUS LEADING TO AN IMPROVED WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
6 2726  47 YOGA NIDRA PRACTICE SHOWS IMPROVEMENT IN SLEEP IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC INSOMNIA: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND YOGA NIDRA IS PRACTISED BY SAGES FOR SLEEP. THE PRACTICE IS SIMPLE TO USE AND HAS BEEN CLEARLY LAID OUT, BUT ITS ROLE IN THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC INSOMNIA HAS NOT BEEN WELL STUDIED. METHODS IN THIS RANDOMIZED PARALLEL-DESIGN STUDY CONDUCTED DURING 2012-16, WE ENROLLED 41 PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC INSOMNIA TO RECEIVE CONVENTIONAL INTERVENTION OF COGNITIVE BEHAVIOURAL THERAPY FOR INSOMNIA (N=20) OR YOGA NIDRA (N=21). OUTCOME MEASURES WERE BOTH SUBJECTIVE USING A SLEEP DIARY AND OBJECTIVE USING POLYSOMNOGRAPHY (PSG). SALIVARY CORTISOL LEVELS WERE ALSO MEASURED. PSG WAS DONE BEFORE THE INTERVENTION IN ALL PATIENTS AND REPEATED ONLY IN THOSE WHO VOLUNTEERED FOR THE SAME. RESULTS BOTH INTERVENTIONS SHOWED AN IMPROVEMENT IN SUBJECTIVE TOTAL SLEEP TIME (TST), SLEEP EFFICIENCY, WAKE AFTER SLEEP ONSET, REDUCTION IN TOTAL WAKE DURATION AND ENHANCEMENT IN SUBJECTIVE SLEEP QUALITY. OBJECTIVELY, BOTH THE INTERVENTIONS IMPROVED TST AND TOTAL WAKE DURATION AND INCREASED N1% OF TST. YOGA NIDRA SHOWED MARKED IMPROVEMENT IN N2% AND N3% IN TST. SALIVARY CORTISOL REDUCED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER YOGA NIDRA (P=0.041). CONCLUSION IMPROVEMENT OF N3 SLEEP, TOTAL WAKE DURATION AND SUBJECTIVE SLEEP QUALITY OCCURRED FOLLOWING YOGA NIDRA PRACTICE. YOGA NIDRA PRACTICE CAN BE USED FOR TREATMENT OF CHRONIC INSOMNIA AFTER SUPERVISED PRACTICE SESSIONS.	2021

METHODS: FORTY-ONE COMMUNITY-DWELLING, AMBULATORY NONPREGNANT ADULTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE RLS WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 12-WEEK YOGA (N = 19) OR EF PROGRAM (N = 22). IN ADDITION TO ATTENDING CLASSES, ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED PRACTICE/TREATMENT LOGS. YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO PRACTICE AT HOME 30 MINUTES PER DAY ON NONCLASS DAYS; EF PARTICIPANTS WERE INSTRUCTED TO RECORD ANY RLS TREATMENTS USED ON THEIR DAILY LOGS. CORE OUTCOMES ASSESSED PRETREATMENT AND POSTTREATMENT WERE RLS SYMPTOMS AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY (INTERNATIONAL RLS STUDY GROUP SCALE (IRLS) AND RLS ORDINAL SCALE), SLEEP QUALITY, MOOD, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). RESULTS: THIRTY ADULTS (13 YOGA, 17 EF), AGED 24 TO 73 (MEAN = 50.4 +/- 2.4 YEARS), COMPLETED THE 12-WEEK STUDY (78% FEMALE, 80.5% WHITE). POST-INTERVENTION, BOTH GROUPS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN RLS SYMPTOMS AND SEVERITY, PERCEIVED STRESS, MOOD, AND QOL-MENTAL HEALTH (P </= .04). RELATIVE TO THE EF GROUP, YOGA PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER REDUCTIONS IN RLS SYMPTOMS AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY (P </= .01), AND GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN PERCEIVED STRESS AND MOOD (P </= .04), AS WELL AS SLEEP QUALITY (P = .09); RLS SYMPTOMS DECREASED TO MINIMAL/MILD IN 77% OF YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS, WITH NONE SCORING IN THE SEVERE RANGE BY WEEK 12, VERSUS 24% AND 12%, RESPECTIVELY, IN EF PARTICIPANTS. IN THE YOGA GROUP, IRLS AND RLS SEVERITY SCORES DECLINED WITH INCREASING MINUTES OF HOMEWORK PRACTICE (R = .7, P = .009 AND R = .6, P = .03, RESPECTIVELY), SUGGESTING A POSSIBLE DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS OF THIS EXPLORATORY RCT SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING RLS SYMPTOMS AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY, DECREASING PERCEIVED STRESS, AND IMPROVING MOOD AND SLEEP IN ADULTS WITH RLS.

8 1980  37 SLEEP MODERATES THE EFFECTS OF TIBETAN YOGA FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY. THIS STUDY EXAMINED SELF-REPORTED AND ACTIGRAPHY-ASSESSED SLEEP AND DEPRESSION AS MODERATORS OF THE EFFECT OF A TIBETAN YOGA INTERVENTION ON SLEEP AND DEPRESSION AMONG WOMEN UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY FOR BREAST CANCER. THIS IS A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF AN RCT EXAMINING A 4-SESSION TIBETAN YOGA PROGRAM (TYP; N = 74) VERSUS STRETCHING PROGRAM (STP; N = 68) OR USUAL CARE (UC; N = 85) ON SELF-REPORTED SLEEP (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI), ACTIGRAPHY-ASSESSED SLEEP EFFICIENCY (SE)) AND DEPRESSION (CENTERS FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES DEPRESSION SCALE; CES-D) FOR WOMEN UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY FOR BREAST CANCER. DATA WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE AND 1-WEEK AND 3-MONTH POST-INTERVENTION. BASELINE PSQI, ACTIGRAPHY-SE, AND CES-D WERE EXAMINED AS MODERATORS OF THE EFFECT OF GROUP ON PSQI, ACTIGRAPHY-SE, AND CES-D 1 WEEK AND 3 MONTHS AFTER TREATMENT. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT BASELINE ACTIGRAPHY-SE X GROUP EFFECT ON PSQI AT 1 WEEK (P < .001) AND 3 MONTHS (P = .002) AND ON CES-D AT 3 MONTHS (P = .049). SPECIFICALLY, THE NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION OF BASELINE ACTIGRAPHY-SE WITH SUBSEQUENT PSQI AND CES-D WAS BUFFERED FOR WOMEN IN THE TYP AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT IN STP, COMPARED TO THOSE IN THE UC. BASELINE PSQI AND CES-D WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT MODERATORS OF THE EFFECT OF GROUP ON ANY OUTCOME. BEHAVIORALLY ASSESSED SLEEP MAY BE A MORE ROBUST INDICATOR OF WHICH PATIENTS ARE MOST APPROPRIATE FOR A YOGA INTERVENTION THAN SELF-REPORTED SLEEP QUALITY. WOMEN WITH POOR SLEEP EFFICIENCY MAY DERIVE THE GREATEST BENEFIT IN TERMS OF SLEEP QUALITY AND MOOD FROM A YOGA INTERVENTION.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
9 2323  52 TREATMENT OF CHRONIC PRIMARY SLEEP ONSET INSOMNIA WITH KUNDALINI YOGA: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH ACTIVE SLEEP HYGIENE COMPARISON. STUDY OBJECTIVES: PRIOR STUDIES HAVE SUGGESTED A BENEFIT OF YOGA FOR ALLEVIATING SLEEP DISTURBANCE; HOWEVER, MANY STUDIES HAVE HAD METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS. THIS TRIAL STUDY AIMED TO EXTEND THAT LITERATURE BY INCLUDING AN ACTIVE SLEEP HYGIENE COMPARISON. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS AGED 25-59 YEARS WITH A PRIMARY COMPLAINT OF SLEEP ONSET INSOMNIA LASTING AT LEAST 6 MONTHS WERE BLOCK RANDOMIZED TO AN 8-WEEK KUNDALINI YOGA OR SLEEP HYGIENE INTERVENTION, BOTH CONSISTING OF INITIAL 60-MINUTE INSTRUCTION AND WEEKLY CHECK-INS. DAILY SLEEP DIARIES AND QUESTIONNAIRES WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE, THROUGHOUT THE INTERVENTION, AND AT 6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING LINEAR MIXED MODELS (N = 20 IN EACH GROUP). RESULTS: PARTICIPANT RATINGS OF THE INTERVENTIONS DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFER. SLEEP HYGIENE IMPROVED SEVERAL DIARY AND QUESTIONNAIRE OUTCOMES, HOWEVER, YOGA RESULTED IN EVEN GREATER IMPROVEMENTS CORRESPONDING TO MEDIUM-TO-LARGE BETWEEN-GROUP EFFECT SIZES. TOTAL SLEEP TIME INCREASED PROGRESSIVELY ACROSS YOGA TREATMENT (D = 0.95, P = .002), CONCURRENT WITH INCREASED SLEEP EFFICIENCY (D = 1.36, P < .001) AND DECREASED SLEEP ONSET LATENCY (D = -1.16, P < .001), BUT WITHOUT CHANGES IN PRE-SLEEP AROUSAL (D =-0.30, P = .59). REMISSION RATES WERE ALSO HIGHER FOR YOGA COMPARED TO SLEEP HYGIENE, WITH >/= 80% OF YOGA PARTICIPANTS REPORTING AVERAGE SLEEP ONSET LATENCY < 30 MINUTES AND SLEEP EFFICIENCY > 80% AT 6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. FOR OVER 50% OF YOGA PARTICIPANTS, THE INSOMNIA SEVERITY INDEX DECREASED BY AT LEAST 8 POINTS AT END OF TREATMENT AND FOLLOW-UP. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA, TAUGHT IN A SELF-CARE FRAMEWORK WITH MINIMAL INSTRUCTOR BURDEN, WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SELF-REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS ABOVE AND BEYOND AN ACTIVE SLEEP HYGIENE COMPARISON, SUSTAINED AT 6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. FOLLOW-UP STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO ASSESS ACTIGRAPHY AND POLYSOMNOGRAPHY OUTCOMES, AS WELL AS POSSIBLE MECHANISMS OF CHANGE.

10 1650  50 MULTICENTER, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA FOR SLEEP QUALITY AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS. PURPOSE: THIRTY PERCENT TO 90% OF CANCER SURVIVORS REPORT IMPAIRED SLEEP QUALITY POST-TREATMENT, WHICH CAN BE SEVERE ENOUGH TO INCREASE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS EXERCISE, ARE RECOMMENDED IN CONJUNCTION WITH DRUGS AND COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF IMPAIRED SLEEP. PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT YOGA-A MIND-BODY PRACTICE AND FORM OF EXERCISE-MAY IMPROVE SLEEP AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS. THE PRIMARY AIM OF THIS RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF A STANDARDIZED YOGA INTERVENTION COMPARED WITH STANDARD CARE FOR IMPROVING GLOBAL SLEEP QUALITY (PRIMARY OUTCOME) AMONG POST-TREATMENT CANCER SURVIVORS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: IN ALL, 410 SURVIVORS SUFFERING FROM MODERATE OR GREATER SLEEP DISRUPTION BETWEEN 2 AND 24 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY, CHEMOTHERAPY, AND/OR RADIATION THERAPY WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO STANDARD CARE OR STANDARD CARE PLUS THE 4-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. THE YOGA INTERVENTION USED THE YOGA FOR CANCER SURVIVORS (YOCAS) PROGRAM CONSISTING OF PRANAYAMA (BREATHING EXERCISES), 16 GENTLE HATHA AND RESTORATIVE YOGA ASANAS (POSTURES), AND MEDITATION. PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED TWO 75-MINUTE SESSIONS PER WEEK. SLEEP QUALITY WAS ASSESSED BY USING THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX AND ACTIGRAPHY PRE- AND POSTINTERVENTION. RESULTS: IN ALL, 410 SURVIVORS WERE ACCRUED (96% FEMALE; MEAN AGE, 54 YEARS; 75% HAD BREAST CANCER). YOGA PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN GLOBAL SLEEP QUALITY AND, SECONDARILY, SUBJECTIVE SLEEP QUALITY, DAYTIME DYSFUNCTION, WAKE AFTER SLEEP ONSET, SLEEP EFFICIENCY, AND MEDICATION USE AT POSTINTERVENTION (ALL P </= .05) COMPARED WITH STANDARD CARE PARTICIPANTS. CONCLUSION: YOGA, SPECIFICALLY THE YOCAS PROGRAM, IS A USEFUL TREATMENT FOR IMPROVING SLEEP QUALITY AND REDUCING SLEEP MEDICATION USE AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
11 2132  36 THE EFFECTS OF A GENTLE YOGA PROGRAM ON SLEEP, MOOD, AND BLOOD PRESSURE IN OLDER WOMEN WITH RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS): A PRELIMINARY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE. TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA VERSUS AN EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM ON SLEEP, MOOD, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND SYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION IN OLDER WOMEN WITH RLS. METHODS. PARTICIPANTS WERE DRAWN FROM A LARGER TRIAL REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK PROFILES IN OVERWEIGHT, SEDENTARY POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. SEVENTY-FIVE WOMEN WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE EITHER AN 8-WEEK YOGA (N = 38) OR EDUCATIONAL FILM (N = 37) PROGRAM. ALL 75 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED AN RLS SCREENING QUESTIONNAIRE. THE 20 WOMEN WHO MET ALL FOUR DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR RLS (N = 10 YOGA, 10 FILM GROUP) COMPRISED THE POPULATION FOR THIS NESTED STUDY. MAIN OUTCOMES ASSESSED PRE- AND POST-TREATMENT INCLUDED: SLEEP (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX), STRESS (PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE), MOOD (PROFILE OF MOOD STATES, STATE-TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY), BLOOD PRESSURE, AND HEART RATE. RESULTS. THE YOGA GROUP DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENTS THAN CONTROLS IN MULTIPLE DOMAINS OF SLEEP QUALITY AND MOOD, AND SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER REDUCTIONS IN INSOMNIA PREVALENCE, ANXIETY, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND BLOOD PRESSURE (ALL P'S</=0.05). ADJUSTED INTERGROUP EFFECT SIZES FOR PSYCHOSOCIAL VARIABLES WERE LARGE, RANGING FROM 1.9 FOR STATE ANXIETY TO 2.6 FOR SLEEP QUALITY. CONCLUSIONS. THESE PRELIMINARY FINDINGS SUGGEST YOGA MAY OFFER AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR IMPROVING SLEEP, MOOD, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND BLOOD PRESSURE IN OLDER WOMEN WITH RLS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
12  258  46 ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF A 12-WEEK YOGA VS. EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS): STUDY PROTOCOL FOR A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS) IS A COMMON AND BURDENSOME SLEEP DISORDER ASSOCIATED WITH PROFOUND IMPAIRMENT OF HEALTH, WELL-BEING, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. UNFORTUNATELY, THE MEDICATIONS USED FOR RLS MANAGEMENT CARRY RISK OF SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS, INCLUDING AUGMENTATION OF SYMPTOMS. YOGA, AN ANCIENT MIND-BODY DISCIPLINE DESIGNED TO PROMOTE PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, AND MENTAL WELL-BEING, MAY OFFER A VIABLE, LOW-RISK NEW TREATMENT. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF THIS PILOT, PARALLEL-ARM, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) ARE TO ASSESS THE ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF A 12-WEEK YOGA VS. EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RLS. METHODS: FORTY-FOUR ADULTS WITH CONFIRMED MODERATE TO SEVERE RLS WILL BE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED TO A 12-WEEK YOGA (N = 22) OR STANDARDIZED EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM (N = 22). YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS WILL ATTEND TWO 75-MIN IYENGAR YOGA CLASSES PER WEEK FOR THE FIRST 4 WEEKS, THEN ONE 75-MIN CLASS PER WEEK FOR THE REMAINING 8 WEEKS, AND WILL COMPLETE A 30-MIN HOMEWORK ROUTINE ON NON-CLASS DAYS. EDUCATIONAL FILM GROUP PARTICIPANTS WILL ATTEND ONE 75-MIN CLASS PER WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS AND COMPLETE A DAILY RLS TREATMENT LOG; CLASSES WILL INCLUDE INFORMATION ON: RLS MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING SLEEP HYGIENE PRACTICES; OTHER SLEEP DISORDERS; AND COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES LIKELY TO BE OF INTEREST TO THOSE PARTICIPATING IN A YOGA AND SLEEP EDUCATION STUDY. YOGA AND TREATMENT LOGS WILL BE COLLECTED WEEKLY. FEASIBILITY OUTCOMES WILL INCLUDE RECRUITMENT, ENROLLMENT, AND RANDOMIZATION RATES, RETENTION, ADHERENCE, AND PROGRAM SATISFACTION. PROGRAM EVALUATION AND YOGA-DOSING QUESTIONNAIRES WILL BE COLLECTED AT WEEK 12; DATA ON EXPLORATORY OUTCOMES (E.G., RLS SYMPTOM SEVERITY (IRLS), SLEEP QUALITY (PSQI), MOOD (POMS, PSS), AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (SF-36)) WILL BE GATHERED AT BASELINE AND WEEK 12. DISCUSSION: THIS STUDY WILL LAY THE ESSENTIAL GROUNDWORK FOR A PLANNED LARGER RCT TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF A YOGA PROGRAM FOR REDUCING SYMPTOMS AND ASSOCIATED BURDEN OF RLS. IF THE FINDINGS OF THE CURRENT TRIAL AND THE SUBSEQUENT LARGER RCTS ARE POSITIVE, THIS STUDY WILL ALSO HELP SUPPORT A NEW APPROACH TO CLINICAL TREATMENT OF THIS CHALLENGING DISORDER, HELP FOSTER IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF RLS ETIOLOGY, AND ULTIMATELY CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCING THE INDIVIDUAL, SOCIETAL, AND ECONOMIC BURDEN ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CONDITION.

13  172  41 A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY OF YOGA SKILLS TRAINING VERSUS AN ATTENTION CONTROL DELIVERED DURING CHEMOTHERAPY ADMINISTRATION. CONTEXT: IT IS IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS FATIGUE AND CO-OCCURRING SYMPTOMS DURING CHEMOTHERAPY TO PRESERVE QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH GASTROINTESTINAL (GI) CANCER. OBJECTIVE: TO CONDUCT A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY OF A YOGA SKILLS TRAINING (YST) INTERVENTION COMPARED TO AN ATTENTION CONTROL (AC) AMONG ADULTS DIAGNOSED WITH GI CANCER. METHODS: YST CONSISTED OF FOUR 30-MINUTE SESSIONS DELIVERED INDIVIDUALLY DURING CHEMOTHERAPY PLUS HOME PRACTICE. AC PROVIDED EMPATHIC ATTENTION PLUS HOME DIARIES. PATIENT-REPORTED (PROMIS T-SCORE) ASSESSMENTS OF FATIGUE, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, SLEEP DISTURBANCES, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS (PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE) WERE COLLECTED AT CHEMOTHERAPY VISITS: BASELINE, WEEK 8, WEEK 10 AND WEEK 14, AND ANALYZED USING A MIXED EFFECTS MODEL. INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND WEEK 10. RESULTS: FORTY-FOUR OF 77 ADULTS APPROACHED AGREED TO PARTICIPATE (57%; YST N = 23; AC N = 21). PARTICIPANTS' MEAN AGE WAS 58 YEARS AND 48% WERE MEN. PARTICIPANTS RANDOMIZED TO YST REPORTED A LARGER DECLINE IN FATIGUE (-2.4 DIFFERENCE, D = 0.30) AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (-2.5 DIFFERENCE, D = 0.30) THAN AC PARTICIPANTS FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 10 AND SLEEP DISTURBANCES AT WEEK 8 (-3.9 DIFFERENCE, D = 0.50). DIFFERENCES IN MAGNITUDE OF CHANGE IN SYMPTOMS WERE CONSISTENT WITH OR EXCEEDED A MINIMALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE. PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS DECREASED MORE IN THE AC AT WEEK 10 (D = 0.30). REDUCTIONS IN INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES (IL-6, STNF R1) WERE LARGER IN THE YST GROUP THAN AC. CONCLUSION: YST SHOWED PROMISE FOR IMPROVING FATIGUE, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, SLEEP DISTURBANCES, AND INFLAMMATION. YST IS ALSO FEASIBLE AND REACHES PATIENTS UNDERREPRESENTED IN YOGA RESEARCH (I.E., GI CANCER, MEN), THUS WARRANTING FURTHER EXAMINATION.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
14 1118  44 EFFICACY OF AN EIGHT-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION ON SYMPTOMS OF RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS): A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS) IS A COMMON AND HIGHLY BURDENSOME SLEEP DISORDER. WHILE RELAXATION THERAPIES, INCLUDING YOGA, ARE OFTEN RECOMMENDED FOR RLS MANAGEMENT, RIGOROUS SUPPORTING RESEARCH IS SPARSE. THE GOAL OF THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON RLS SYMPTOMS AND RELATED OUTCOMES IN WOMEN WITH RLS. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE 13 NONSMOKING WOMEN WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE RLS, WHO DID NOT HAVE DIABETES, SLEEP APNEA, OR OTHER SERIOUS CONCOMITANT CHRONIC CONDITIONS, AND WHO WERE NOT PREGNANT. THE INTERVENTION WAS A GENTLE, 8-WEEK IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM. CORE OUTCOMES ASSESSED PRE- AND POST-TREATMENT WERE RLS SYMPTOMS AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY (INTERNATIONAL RLS SCALE [IRLS] AND RLS ORDINAL SCALE), SLEEP QUALITY (MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY SLEEP SCALE), MOOD (PROFILE OF MOOD STATES), AND PERCEIVED STRESS (PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE). PARTICIPANTS ALSO COMPLETED YOGA LOGS AND A BRIEF EXIT QUESTIONNAIRE REGARDING THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH THE STUDY. RESULTS: TEN (10) WOMEN, AGED 32-66 YEARS, COMPLETED THE STUDY. PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED AN AVERAGE 13.4+/-0.5 (OF 16 POSSIBLE) CLASSES, AND COMPLETED A MEAN OF 4.1+/-0.3 (OF 5 POSSIBLE) HOMEWORK SESSIONS/WEEK. AT FOLLOW-UP, PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED STRIKING REDUCTIONS IN RLS SYMPTOMS AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY, WITH SYMPTOMS DECREASING TO MINIMAL/MILD IN ALL BUT 1 WOMAN AND NO PARTICIPANT SCORING IN THE SEVERE RANGE BY WEEK 8. EFFECT SIZES (COHEN'S D) WERE LARGE: 1.6 FOR IRLS TOTAL, AND 2.2 FOR RLS ORDINAL SCALE. IRLS SCORES DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH INCREASING MINUTES OF HOMEWORK PRACTICE PER SESSION (R=0.70, P=0.025) AND TOTAL HOMEWORK MINUTES (R=0.64, P<0.05), SUGGESTING A POSSIBLE DOSE-RESPONSE RELATION. PARTICIPANTS ALSO SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN SLEEP, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND MOOD (ALL P'S</=0.02), WITH EFFECT SIZES RANGING FROM 1.0 TO 1.6. CONCLUSIONS: THESE PRELIMINARY FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN ATTENUATING RLS SYMPTOMS AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY, REDUCING PERCEIVED STRESS, AND IMPROVING SLEEP AND MOOD IN WOMEN WITH RLS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
15 2851  50 YOGA, PHYSICAL THERAPY, AND BACK PAIN EDUCATION FOR SLEEP QUALITY IN LOW-INCOME RACIALLY DIVERSE ADULTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: POOR SLEEP IS COMMON AMONG ADULTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP), BUT THE INFLUENCE OF CLBP TREATMENTS, SUCH AS YOGA AND PHYSICAL THERAPY (PT), ON SLEEP QUALITY IS UNDER STUDIED. OBJECTIVE: EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AND PT FOR IMPROVING SLEEP QUALITY IN ADULTS WITH CLBP. DESIGN: SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: ACADEMIC SAFETY-NET HOSPITAL AND 7 AFFILIATED COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS. PARTICIPANTS: A TOTAL OF 320 ADULTS WITH CLBP. INTERVENTION: TWELVE WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES, 1-ON-1 PT SESSIONS, OR AN EDUCATIONAL BOOK. MAIN MEASURES: SLEEP QUALITY WAS MEASURED USING THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI) GLOBAL SCORE (0-21) AT BASELINE, 12 WEEKS, AND 52 WEEKS. ADDITIONALLY, WE ALSO EVALUATED HOW THE PROPORTION OF PARTICIPANTS WHO ACHIEVED A CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL IMPROVEMENT IN SLEEP QUALITY (> 3-POINT REDUCTION IN PSQI) AT 12 WEEKS VARIED BY CHANGES IN PAIN AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION AT 6 WEEKS. KEY RESULTS: AMONG PARTICIPANTS (MEAN AGE = 46.0, 64% FEMALE, 82% NON-WHITE), NEARLY ALL (92%) REPORTED POOR SLEEP QUALITY (PSQI > 5) AT BASELINE. AT 12 WEEKS, MODEST IMPROVEMENTS IN SLEEP QUALITY WERE OBSERVED AMONG THE YOGA (PSQI MEAN DIFFERENCE [MD] = - 1.19, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI] - 1.82, - 0.55) AND PT (PSQI MD = - 0.91, 95% CI - 1.61, - 0.20) GROUPS. PARTICIPANTS WHO REPORTED A >/= 30% IMPROVEMENT IN PAIN OR PHYSICAL FUNCTION AT 6 WEEKS, COMPARED WITH THOSE WHO IMPROVED < 10%, WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE A SLEEP QUALITY RESPONDER AT 12 WEEKS (ODDS RATIO [OR] = 3.51, 95% CI 1.73, 7.11 AND OR = 2.16, 95% CI 1.18, 3.95, RESPECTIVELY). RESULTS WERE SIMILAR AT 52 WEEKS. CONCLUSION: IN A SAMPLE OF ADULTS WITH CLBP, VIRTUALLY ALL WITH POOR SLEEP QUALITY PRIOR TO INTERVENTION, MODEST BUT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN SLEEP QUALITY WERE OBSERVED WITH BOTH YOGA AND PT. IRRESPECTIVE OF TREATMENT, CLINICALLY IMPORTANT SLEEP IMPROVEMENTS AT THE END OF THE INTERVENTION WERE ASSOCIATED WITH MID-INTERVENTION PAIN AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION IMPROVEMENTS.

16 1194  28 EXAMINING MEDIATORS AND MODERATORS OF YOGA FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY. HYPOTHESIS THIS STUDY EXAMINES MODERATORS AND MEDIATORS OF A YOGA INTERVENTION TARGETING QUALITY-OF-LIFE (QOL) OUTCOMES IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER RECEIVING RADIOTHERAPY.METHODS WOMEN UNDERGOING 6 WEEKS OF RADIOTHERAPY WERE RANDOMIZED TO A YOGA (YG; N = 53) OR STRETCHING (ST; N = 56) INTERVENTION OR A WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (WL; N = 54). DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND SLEEP DISTURBANCES WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE. MEDIATOR (POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS SYMPTOMS, BENEFIT FINDING, AND CORTISOL SLOPE) AND OUTCOME (36-ITEM SHORT FORM [SF]-36 MENTAL AND PHYSICAL COMPONENT SCALES [MCS AND PCS]) VARIABLES WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE, END-OF-TREATMENT, AND 1-, 3-, AND 6-MONTHS POSTTREATMENT. RESULTS BASELINE DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (P = .03) AND SLEEP DISTURBANCES (P < .01) MODERATED THE GROUP X TIME EFFECT ON MCS, BUT NOT PCS. WOMEN WITH HIGH BASELINE DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IN YG REPORTED MARGINALLY HIGHER 3-MONTH MCS THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN WL (P = .11). WOMEN WITH HIGH BASELINE SLEEP DISTURBANCES IN YG REPORTED HIGHER 3-MONTHS MCS THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN WL (P < .01) AND HIGHER 6-MONTH MCS THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN ST (P = .01). YG LED TO GREATER BENEFIT FINDING THAN ST AND WL ACROSS THE FOLLOW-UP (P = .01). THREE-MONTH BENEFIT FINDING PARTIALLY MEDIATED THE EFFECT OF YG ON 6-MONTH PCS. POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS SYMPTOMS AND CORTISOL SLOPE DID NOT MEDIATE TREATMENT EFFECT ON QOL. CONCLUSION YOGA MAY PROVIDE THE GREATEST MENTAL-HEALTH-RELATED QOL BENEFITS FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING PRE-RADIOTHERAPY SLEEP DISTURBANCE AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. YOGA MAY IMPROVE PHYSICAL-HEALTH-RELATED QOL BY INCREASING ABILITY TO FIND BENEFIT IN THE CANCER EXPERIENCE.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
17 1748  40 PILOT RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL OF A DYADIC YOGA PROGRAM FOR GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS. BACKGROUND: WHILE THE USE OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE IN MANAGING GLIOMA PATIENTS' SYMPTOMS IS NOT WELL STUDIED, THE HIGH SYMPTOM BURDEN IN PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS IS WELL ESTABLISHED. WE CONDUCTED A PILOT RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF A DYADIC YOGA (DY) INTERVENTION AS A SUPPORTIVE CARE STRATEGY. METHODS: GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 12-SESSION DY OR WAITLIST CONTROL (WLC) GROUP. PRIOR TO RADIOTHERAPY AND RANDOMIZATION, BOTH GROUPS COMPLETED MEASURES OF CANCER-RELATED SYMPTOMS (MD ANDERSON SYMPTOM INVENTORY-BRAIN TUMOR MODULE), DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (CENTER FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES-DEPRESSION MEASURE), FATIGUE (BRIEF FATIGUE INVENTORY), AND OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL; MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY 36-ITEM SHORT-FORM SURVEY). DYADS WERE REASSESSED AT THE LAST DAY OF RADIOTHERAPY. RESULTS: TWENTY PATIENTS (MEAN AGE: 46 YEARS, 50% FEMALE, 80% WHO GRADE IV AND CAREGIVERS (MEAN AGE: 50 YEARS, 70% FEMALE, 50% SPOUSES) PARTICIPATED IN THE TRIAL. A PRIORI FEASIBILITY CRITERIA WERE MET REGARDING CONSENT (70%), ADHERENCE (88%), AND RETENTION (95%) RATES. CONTROLLING FOR RELEVANT COVARIATES, CHANGE SCORE ANALYSES REVEALED CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS FOR PATIENTS IN THE DY COMPARED WITH THE WLC GROUP FOR OVERALL CANCER SYMPTOM SEVERITY (D = 0.96) AND SYMPTOM INTERFERENCE (D = 0.74), DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (D = 0.71), AND MENTAL QOL (D = 0.69). CAREGIVERS IN THE DY GROUP REPORTED CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (D = 1.12), FATIGUE (D = 0.89), AND MENTAL QOL (D = 0.49) RELATIVE TO THOSE IN THE WLC GROUP. CONCLUSION: A DY INTERVENTION APPEARS TO BE A FEASIBLE AND BENEFICIAL SYMPTOM AND QOL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. AN EFFICACY TRIAL WITH A MORE STRINGENT CONTROL GROUP IS WARRANTED.

18 2553  33 YOGA FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS AFTER COMPLETING CANCER TREATMENT. SURVIVORS OF CHILDHOOD CANCER MAY EXPERIENCE PERSISTENT SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, AND BALANCE IMPAIRMENT. YOGA IS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY THAT IMPROVES FATIGUE, SLEEP, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN ADULT CANCER SURVIVORS. USING A ONE GROUP, REPEATED MEASURES DESIGN, WE EVALUATED THE FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA PROGRAM AND ASSESSED IF CANCER SURVIVOR PARTICIPANTS AGES 10 TO 17 YEARS (N = 13) HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LESS FATIGUE AND ANXIETY, AND BETTER BALANCE AND SLEEP, AFTER A 6-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION COMPARED WITH A 6-WEEK PRE-INTERVENTION WAIT PERIOD. STUDY RECRUITMENT WAS CHALLENGING WITH A 32% ENROLLMENT RATE; YOGA ATTENDANCE WAS 90%. NONE OF THE SCORES FOR ANXIETY, FATIGUE, SLEEP, AND BALANCE HAD SIGNIFICANT CHANGES DURING THE WAIT PERIOD. AFTER THE 6-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM, CHILDREN (N = 7) HAD A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN ANXIETY SCORE (P = .04) WHILE ADOLESCENT SCORES (N = 7) SHOWED A DECREASING TREND (P = .10). SCORES FOR FATIGUE, SLEEP, AND BALANCE REMAINED STABLE POST-INTERVENTION. FATIGUE AND BALANCE SCORES WERE BELOW NORMS FOR HEALTH CHILDREN/ADOLESCENTS WHILE SLEEP AND ANXIETY SCORES WERE SIMILAR TO HEALTHY PEERS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
19 2321  42 TREATMENT OF CHRONIC INSOMNIA WITH YOGA: A PRELIMINARY STUDY WITH SLEEP-WAKE DIARIES. THERE IS GOOD EVIDENCE FOR COGNITIVE AND PHYSIOLOGICAL AROUSAL IN CHRONIC INSOMNIA. ACCORDINGLY, CLINICAL TRIAL STUDIES OF INSOMNIA TREATMENTS AIMED AT REDUCING AROUSAL, INCLUDING RELAXATION AND MEDITATION, HAVE REPORTED POSITIVE RESULTS. YOGA IS A MULTICOMPONENT PRACTICE THAT IS ALSO KNOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING AROUSAL, ALTHOUGH IT HAS NOT BEEN WELL EVALUATED AS A TREATMENT FOR INSOMNIA. IN THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY, A SIMPLE DAILY YOGA TREATMENT WAS EVALUATED IN A CHRONIC INSOMNIA POPULATION CONSISTING OF SLEEP-ONSET AND/OR SLEEP-MAINTENANCE INSOMNIA AND PRIMARY OR SECONDARY INSOMNIA. PARTICIPANTS MAINTAINED SLEEP-WAKE DIARIES DURING A PRETREATMENT 2-WEEK BASELINE AND A SUBSEQUENT 8-WEEK INTERVENTION, IN WHICH THEY PRACTICED THE TREATMENT ON THEIR OWN FOLLOWING A SINGLE IN-PERSON TRAINING SESSION WITH SUBSEQUENT BRIEF IN-PERSON AND TELEPHONE FOLLOW-UPS. SLEEP EFFICIENCY (SE), TOTAL SLEEP TIME (TST), TOTAL WAKE TIME (TWT), SLEEP ONSET LATENCY (SOL), WAKE TIME AFTER SLEEP ONSET (WASO), NUMBER OF AWAKENINGS, AND SLEEP QUALITY MEASURES WERE DERIVED FROM SLEEP-WAKE DIARY ENTRIES AND WERE AVERAGED IN 2-WEEK INTERVALS. FOR 20 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETING THE PROTOCOL, STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE OBSERVED IN SE, TST, TWT, SOL, AND WASO AT END-TREATMENT AS COMPARED WITH PRETREATMENT VALUES.	2004	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
20  252  32 A YOGA PROGRAM FOR THE SYMPTOMS OF POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER IN VETERANS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF A YOGA PROGRAM AS AN ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY FOR IMPROVING POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) SYMPTOMS IN VETERANS WITH MILITARY-RELATED PTSD. VETERANS (N = 12) PARTICIPATED IN A 6 WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION HELD TWICE A WEEK. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PTSD HYPERAROUSAL SYMPTOMS AND OVERALL SLEEP QUALITY AS WELL AS DAYTIME DYSFUNCTION RELATED TO SLEEP. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE TOTAL PTSD, ANGER, OR QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOME SCORES. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THIS YOGA PROGRAM MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY FOR IMPROVING HYPERAROUSAL SYMPTOMS OF PTSD INCLUDING SLEEP QUALITY. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT THE YOGA PROGRAM IS ACCEPTABLE, FEASIBLE, AND THAT THERE IS GOOD ADHERENCE IN A VETERAN POPULATION.	2013

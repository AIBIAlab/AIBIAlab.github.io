1 2124 94 THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PRENATAL YOGA ON DELIVERY OUTCOMES: A META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: THE EFFICACY OF YOGA ON DELIVERY OUTCOMES REMAINING CONTROVERSY. OBJECTIVES: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF PRENATAL YOGA ON DELIVERY OUTCOMES. METHODS: THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, PUBMED, EMBASE, WEB OF SCIENCE, CINAHL AND ELSEVIER DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FROM INCEPTION TO JANUARY 22, 2020, AND RANDOMIZED, QUASI-RANDOMIZED AND NON-RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS EVALUATING THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE DELIVERY OUTCOMES IN PREGNANT WOMEN WERE INCLUDED. THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY WAS ASSESSED BY THE COCHRANE COLLABORATION'S TOOL. META-ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED USING REVMAN 5.3. RESULTS: THIS META-ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED THAT YOGA IMPROVED VAGINAL DELIVERY, DECREASED PREMATURE DELIVERY AND BIRTH WEIGHT OF NEWBORNS, SHORTEN THE LABOR DURATION. CONCLUSION: PRENATAL YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE TO IMPROVE DELIVERY OUTCOMES AND NOT TO INCREASE THE RISK OF FETUS, WHICH IS WORTH RECOMMENDING TO PREGNANT WOMEN. BUT STUDIES INVOLVED IN THIS META-ANALYSIS WERE NOT ALL OF HIGH QUALITY.

2 2088 26 THE EFFECT OF PRACTICING YOGA DURING PREGNANCY ON LABOR STAGES LENGTH, ANXIETY AND PAIN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: ANXIETY AND FEAR OF LABOR PAIN HAS LED TO ELEVATED CESAREAN SECTION RATE IN SOME COUNTRIES. THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA IN PREGNANCY ON ANXIETY, LABOR PAIN AND LENGTH OF LABOR STAGES. METHODS: THIS CLINICAL TRIAL STUDY WAS PERFORMED ON 84 NULLIPAROUS WOMEN WHO WERE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OLD AND WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS OF YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS. PREGNANCY YOGA PROGRAM CONSISTING OF 6 60-MIN TRAINING SESSIONS WAS STARTED EVERY 2 WEEKS FROM WEEK 26 OF PREGNANCY AND CONTINUED UNTIL 37 WEEKS OF GESTATION. ANXIETY SEVERITY AT MATERNAL ADMISSION TO LABOR WAS MEASURED BY THE SPIELBERGERS STATE-TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY, AND LABOR PAIN WAS MEASURED BY VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS) AT DILATATION (4-5 CM) AND 2 H AFTER THE FIRST MEASUREMENT. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING CHI-SQUARE AND T-TEST. RESULTS: INTERVENTION GROUP REPORTED LESS PAIN AT DILATATION (4-5 CM) (P=0.001) AND 2 H AFTER THE FIRST MEASUREMENT (P=0.001) THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. STAT ANXIETY WAS ALSO LOWER IN INTERVENTION GROUP THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (P=0.003) AT THE ENTRANCE TO LABOR ROOM. SUBJECTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP REQUIRED MORE INDUCTION COMPARED TO INTERVENTION GROUP (P=0.003). WOMEN IN INTERVENTION GROUP EXPERIENCED SHORTER DURATION OF THE FIRST PHASE OF THE LABOR THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (P=0.002). ALSO, THE TOTAL DURATION OF TWO STAGES OF LABOR WAS SHORTER IN INTERVENTION GROUP THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: PRACTICING YOGA DURING PREGNANCY MAY REDUCE WOMEN'S ANXIETY DURING LABOR; SHORTEN LABOR STAGES, AND LOWER LABOR PAIN.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
3 2524 22 YOGA DURING PREGNANCY: EFFECTS ON MATERNAL COMFORT, LABOR PAIN AND BIRTH OUTCOMES. THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA PROGRAM DURING PREGNANCY, ON MATERNAL COMFORT, LABOR PAIN, AND BIRTH OUTCOMES. A RANDOMIZED TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED USING 74-PRIMIGRAVID THAI WOMEN WHO WERE EQUALLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS (EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL). THE YOGA PROGRAM INVOLVED SIX, 1-H SESSIONS AT PRESCRIBED WEEKS OF GESTATION. A VARIETY OF INSTRUMENTS WERE USED TO ASSESS MATERNAL COMFORT, LABOR PAIN AND BIRTH OUTCOMES. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS FOUND TO HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF MATERNAL COMFORT DURING LABOR AND 2H POST-LABOR, AND EXPERIENCED LESS SUBJECT EVALUATED LABOR PAIN THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. IN EACH GROUP, PAIN INCREASED AND MATERNAL COMFORT DECREASED AS LABOR PROGRESSED. NO DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND, BETWEEN THE GROUPS, REGARDING PETHIDINE USAGE, LABOR AUGMENTATION OR NEWBORN APGAR SCORES AT 1 AND 5 MIN. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS FOUND TO HAVE A SHORTER DURATION OF THE FIRST STAGE OF LABOR, AS WELL AS THE TOTAL TIME OF LABOR.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
4 2113 35 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE DELIVERY AND NEONATAL OUTCOMES IN NULLIPAROUS PREGNANT WOMEN IN IRAN: A CLINICAL TRIAL STUDY. BACKGROUND: YOGA CAN REDUCE THE RISK OF PRETERM DELIVERY, CESAREAN SECTION (CS), AND FETAL DEATH. THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PREGNANCY, DELIVERY, AND NEONATAL OUTCOMES. METHODS: THIS WAS A CLINICAL TRIAL STUDY AND USING THE RANDOM SAMPLING WITHOUT REPLACEMENT 70 PREGNANT WOMEN ENTERED HATHA YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS ACCORDING TO THE COLOR OF THE BALL THEY TOOK FROM A BAG CONTAINING TWO BALLS (BLUE OR RED). THE DATA COLLECTION TOOL WAS A QUESTIONNAIRE PREGNANCY, DELIVERY, AND NEONATAL OUTCOMES. THE INTERVENTION IN THIS STUDY INCLUDED PREGNANCY HATHA YOGA EXERCISES THAT FIRST SESSION OF PREGNANCY YOGA STARTED FROM THE 26TH WEEK AND SAMPLES ATTENDED THE LAST SESSION IN THE 37TH WEEK. THEY EXERCISED YOGA TWICE A WEEK (EACH SESSION LASTING 75 MIN) IN A YOGA SPECIALIZED SPORTS CLUB. THE CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED THE ROUTINE PRENATAL CARE THAT ALL PREGNANT WOMEN RECEIVE. RESULTS: THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT YOGA REDUCED THE INDUCTION OF LABOR, THE EPISIOTOMY RUPTURE, DURATION OF LABOR, ALSO HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON NORMAL BIRTH WEIGHT AND DELIVERY AT THE APPROPRIATE GESTATIONAL AGE. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND APGAR SCORES OF THE INFANTS. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS OF THE PRESENT STUDY SHOWED THAT YOGA CAN IMPROVE THE OUTCOMES OF PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH. THEY CAN BE USED AS PART OF THE CARE PROTOCOL ALONG WITH CHILDBIRTH PREPARATION CLASSES TO REDUCE THE COMPLICATIONS OF PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH.

6 1053 32 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK FACTORS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: THE AIM OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO SYSTEMATICALLY ASSESS AND META-ANALYZE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON MODIFIABLE BIOLOGICAL CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK FACTORS IN THE GENERAL POPULATION AND IN HIGH-RISK DISEASE GROUPS. METHODS: MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, AND INDMED WERE SCREENED THROUGH AUGUST 2013 FOR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) ON YOGA FOR PREDEFINED CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS IN HEALTHY PARTICIPANTS, NON-DIABETIC PARTICIPANTS WITH HIGH RISK FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, OR PARTICIPANTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS. RISK OF BIAS WAS ASSESSED USING THE COCHRANE RISK OF BIAS TOOL. RESULTS: FORTY-FOUR RCTS WITH A TOTAL OF 3168 PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED. RISK OF BIAS WAS HIGH OR UNCLEAR FOR MOST RCTS. RELATIVE TO USUAL CARE OR NO INTERVENTION, YOGA IMPROVED SYSTOLIC (MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD)=-5.85 MM HG; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI)=-8.81, -2.89) AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (MD=-4.12 MM HG; 95%CI=-6.55, -1.69), HEART RATE (MD=-6.59 BPM; 95%CI=-12.89, -0.28), RESPIRATORY RATE (MD=-0.93 BREATHS/MIN; 95%CI=-1.70, -0.15), WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE (MD=-1.95 CM; 95%CI=-3.01, -0.89), WAIST/HIP RATIO (MD=-0.02; 95%CI=-0.03, -0.00), TOTAL CHOLESTEROL (MD=-13.09 MG/DL; 95%CI=-19.60, -6.59), HDL (MD=2.94 MG/DL; 95%CI=0.57, 5.31), VLDL (MD=-5.70 MG/DL; 95%CI=-7.36, -4.03), TRIGLYCERIDES (MD=-20.97 MG/DL; 95%CI=-28.61, -13.32), HBA1C (MD=-0.45%; 95%CI=-0.87, -0.02), AND INSULIN RESISTANCE (MD=-0.19; 95%CI=-0.30, -0.08). RELATIVE TO EXERCISE, YOGA IMPROVED HDL (MD=3.70 MG/DL; 95%CI=1.14, 6.26). CONCLUSIONS: THIS META-ANALYSIS REVEALED EVIDENCE FOR CLINICALLY IMPORTANT EFFECTS OF YOGA ON MOST BIOLOGICAL CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK FACTORS. DESPITE METHODOLOGICAL DRAWBACKS OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES, YOGA CAN BE CONSIDERED AS AN ANCILLARY INTERVENTION FOR THE GENERAL POPULATION AND FOR PATIENTS WITH INCREASED RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
7 2525 29 YOGA DURING PREGNANCY: THE EFFECTS ON LABOR PAIN AND DELIVERY OUTCOMES (A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL). OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF AN ANTENATAL YOGA PROGRAM ON PERCEIVED MATERNAL LABOR PAIN AND DELIVERY OUTCOMES. MATERIAL & METHODS: THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED WITH SIXTY PRIMIPAROUS WOMEN, AGED 18-35 YEARS OLD, WHO WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER AN ANTENATAL YOGA PROGRAM OR CONTROL GROUPS. LABOR PAIN AND DISCOMFORT LEVEL OF THE PARTICIPANTS WERE MEASURED USING A VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE AT CERVICAL DILATATION OF 3-4 C AND AT 2 AND 4 H AFTER THE INITIAL MEASUREMENT. DEMOGRAPHIC AND OBSTETRICAL INFORMATION WERE COLLECTED. THE ANTENATAL YOGA PROGRAM CONSISTED OF A 1-H SUPERVISED YOGA CLASS, THREE TIMES A WEEKLY, STARTING AT 26 WEEKS GESTATION. . RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS IN CONTROL GROUP REPORTED HIGHER PAIN INTENSITY COMPARED TO EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AT 3-4 CM OF DILATATION (P = 0.01) AND AT 2 H AFTER THE FIRST AND THE SECOND MEASUREMENTS (P = 0.000). MOTHERS IN THE ANTENATAL INTERVENTION GROUP THAT COMPLETED THE YOGA CLASS REQUIRED A DECREASED FREQUENCY OF LABOR INDUCTION IN COMPARISON WITH CONTROL GROUP (P = 0.008). IN ADDITION, MODE OF DELIVERY OF THE INTERVENTION GROUP RESULTED IN A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF CESAREAN SECTION THAN CONTROL GROUP (P = 0.002). LASTLY, THE INTERVENTION GROUP EXPERIENCED A SHORTER DURATION OF THE SECOND AND THIRD STAGES OF LABOR. INTERVAL LEVEL DATA WAS ANALYZED BY USING AN INDEPENDENT T-TEST AND CHI-SQUARE. CONCLUSION: YOGA DURING PREGNANCY MAY CONTRIBUTE TO A REDUCTION PAIN OF LABOR AND IMPROVED ADEQUACY OF CHILDBIRTH.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
8 1135 27 EFFICACY OF YOGA ON PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISCOMFORTS AND DELIVERY OUTCOMES IN CHINESE PRIMIPARAS. BACKGROUD AND PURPOSE: ALMOST EVERY WOMAN EXPERIENCES DISCOMFORTS DURING PREGNANCY. THIS STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA ON PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISCOMFORTS AND DELIVERY OUTCOMES IN CHINESE PRIMIPARAS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED. PARTICIPANTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP (N = 32) RECEIVED ROUTINE PRENATAL CARE, WHEREAS PARTICIPANTS IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 32) RECEIVED ROUTINE PRENATAL CARE AND YOGA EXERCISE THREE TIMES A WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS. OUTCOMES EVALUATED INCLUDED PHYSIOLOGICAL DISCOMFORTS, PRENATAL DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY AND DELIVERY OUTCOMES. INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED. RESULTS: YOGA DECREASED THE SYMPTOMS OF PHYSIOLOGICAL DISCOMFORTS DURING PREGNANCY (F = 6.966, P = 0.010), PROMOTED CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY (F = 11.900, P = 0.001), INCREASED THE RATE OF VAGINAL DELIVERY (CHI(2) = 4.267, P = 0.039), AND SHORTENED THE LENGTH OF THE FIRST (T = -2.612, P = 0.012), SECOND (Z = -3.313, P = 0.001) AND THIRD STAGES OF LABOR (Z = -3.137, P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: YOGA OFFERS BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON PHYSIOLOGICAL DISCOMFORTS, CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY AND DELIVERY OUTCOMES IN CHINESE PRIMIPARAS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
9  956 24 EFFECTS OF A PRENATAL YOGA PROGRAMME ON THE DISCOMFORTS OF PREGNANCY AND MATERNAL CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY IN TAIWAN. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE A YOGA PROGRAMME PROVIDED TO PRIMIGRAVIDAS IN THE THIRD TRIMESTER OF PREGNANCY WITH THE AIM OF DECREASING THE DISCOMFORTS ASSOCIATED WITH PREGNANCY AND INCREASING CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY. DESIGN: NON-RANDOMISED CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTAL STUDY. SETTING: A HOSPITAL IN NORTHERN TAIWAN. PARTICIPANTS: THE TARGET POPULATION WAS PRIMIGRAVIDAS AT 26-28 WEEKS OF GESTATION (NO HIGH-RISK PREGNANCIES) WHO HAD NOT ENGAGED IN REGULAR EXERCISE OR YOGA FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR. THE STUDY INCLUDED 88 INDIVIDUALS; 43 IN THE CONTROL GROUP AND 45 IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WHO TOOK PART IN THE PRENATAL YOGA PROGRAMME. INTERVENTION: THE DURATION OF THE PRENATAL YOGA PROGRAMME WAS 12-14 WEEKS, WITH AT LEAST THREE SESSIONS PER WEEK. EACH WORKOUT LASTED FOR 30 MINUTES. MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: WOMEN WHO TOOK PART IN THE PRENATAL YOGA PROGRAMME REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER PREGNANCY DISCOMFORTS THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (38.28 VS 43.26, Z=-2.58, P=0.01) AT 38-40 WEEKS OF GESTATION. THE SUBJECTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE YOGA PROGRAMME EXHIBITED HIGHER OUTCOME AND SELF-EFFICACY EXPECTANCIES DURING THE ACTIVE STAGE OF LABOUR (104.13 VS 83.53, T=3.24, P=0.002; 99.26 VS 77.70, T=3.99, P </= 0.001) AND THE SECOND STAGE OF LABOUR (113.33 VS 88.42, T=3.33, P=0.002; 102.19 VS 79.40, T=3.71, P </= 0.001) COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. KEY CONCLUSIONS: THE PROVISION OF BOOKLETS AND VIDEOS ON YOGA DURING PREGNANCY MAY CONTRIBUTE TO A REDUCTION IN PREGNANCY DISCOMFORTS AND IMPROVED CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: THIS YOGA PROGRAMME PROVIDES HEALTH-CARE PROFESSIONALS WITH AN EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTION.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
10 2051 30 THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PRENATAL YOGA AND THE ADMINISTRATION OF RITODRINE HYDROCHLORIDE DURING PREGNANCY: AN ADJUNCT STUDY OF THE JAPAN ENVIRONMENT AND CHILDREN'S STUDY. INTRODUCTION: WHILE THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF PRENATAL YOGA HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN RECENT YEARS, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT ITS EFFECTIVENESS IN PREGNANT JAPANESE WOMEN. DESPITE SEVERAL ADVERSE EFFECTS, RITODRINE HYDROCHLORIDE IS FREQUENTLY PRESCRIBED TO SUPPRESS PRETERM LABOR IN JAPAN, AND ITS USAGE MAY THEREFORE INDICATE CASES OF PRETERM LABOR. THIS STUDY AIMED TO CLARIFY THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PRENATAL YOGA AND RITODRINE HYDROCHLORIDE USE DURING PREGNANCY. METHODS: AN OBSERVATIONAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AS AN ADJUNCT STUDY BY THE HOKKAIDO UNIT OF THE JAPAN ENVIRONMENT AND CHILDREN'S STUDY. INFORMATION ON PRENATAL YOGA PRACTICE WAS COLLECTED USING A SELF-QUESTIONNAIRE BETWEEN MARCH 21, 2012, AND JULY 7, 2015, TARGETING WOMEN WHO HAD RECENTLY DELIVERED. RITODRINE HYDROCHLORIDE USE WAS IDENTIFIED FROM MEDICAL RECORDS. A TOTAL OF 2,692 WOMEN WERE ANALYZED USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELS THAT ADJUSTED FOR POSSIBLE CONFOUNDERS. RESULTS: THERE WERE 567 (21.1%) WOMEN WHO PRACTICED PRENATAL YOGA, WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A LOWER RISK OF RITODRINE HYDROCHLORIDE USE (ADJUSTED ODDS RATIO [OR] 0.77; 95% CI 0.61-0.98). THIS WAS ESPECIALLY EVIDENT IN WOMEN WITH A TOTAL PRACTICE DURATION THAT EXCEEDED 900 MINUTES THROUGHOUT THEIR PREGNANCY (ADJUSTED OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.38-0.76). A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS THAT EXCLUDED PATIENTS WITH THREATENED ABORTION DURING THE STUDY PERIOD PRODUCED SIMILAR RESULTS. CONCLUSIONS: PRENATAL YOGA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A LOWER RISK OF RITODRINE HYDROCHLORIDE USE, PARTICULARLY IN WOMEN WITH MORE THAN 900 MINUTES OF PRACTICE TIME OVER THE COURSE OF THEIR PREGNANCY. PRENATAL YOGA MAY BE A BENEFICIAL OPTION FOR PREGNANT WOMEN IN THE SELECTION OF ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
11 1797 37 PRENATAL YOGA: EFFECTS ON ALLEVIATION OF LABOR PAIN AND BIRTH OUTCOMES. BACKGROUND: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT PRENATAL YOGIC EXERCISES ARE EFFECTIVE IN ALLEVIATING LABOR PAIN AND IMPROVING BIRTH OUTCOMES, BY COMPARING PREGNANT WOMEN UNDERTAKING YOGA WITH A CONTROL GROUP. TRIAL DESIGN: SINGLE BLINDED, PARALLEL RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL. METHODS: TWO HUNDRED PRIMIGRAVID WOMEN OF 30 WEEKS OF GESTATION ONWARD WHO MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA (PRIMIGRAVIDA, 20-35 YEARS OF AGE, GESTATIONAL AGE OF 30 WEEKS, NO PRIOR EXPERIENCE OF YOGA) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO STUDY (N = 100) AND CONTROL GROUPS (N = 100) BY USING THE MINIMIZED RANDOMIZATION PROGRAM VERSION 2.01. THE STUDY GROUP RECEIVED THE INTERVENTION IN THE FORM OF INTEGRATED YOGA CONSISTING OF A SERIES OF 30-MIN PRACTICE SESSIONS AT THE 30TH, 32ND, 34TH, 36TH, 37TH, 38TH, AND 39TH WEEKS OF GESTATIONAL AGE. THE MATCHED CONTROL GROUP DID NOT PERFORM YOGA. THE PATIENTS WERE FOLLOWED TILL DELIVERY FOR MATERNAL COMFORT, ALLEVIATION OF LABOR PAIN, AND BIRTH OUTCOME. ALLEVIATION OF LABOR PAIN WAS ASSESSED BY USING NUMERICAL PAIN INTENSITY SCALE (NPIS), PAIN BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONAL SCALE (PBOS), AND MATERNAL DELIVERY COMFORT QUESTIONNAIRE. ONLY THE ASSESSORS WERE BLINDED. RESULTS: TWO HUNDRED PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO 100 EACH IN CASE AND CONTROL GROUPS. FINAL ANALYSIS WAS DONE ON 75 PATIENTS IN EACH GROUP AFTER EXCLUSION DUE TO DEVELOPMENT OF COMPLICATIONS, LOSS TO FOLLOW-UP. THE REQUIREMENT OF INDUCTION OF LABOR AND ANALGESICS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS IN THE STUDY GROUP (P < 0.044, P < 0.045). THERE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE NUMBER OF NORMAL VAGINAL DELIVERIES (P < 0.037) AND LESS CAESAREAN SECTIONS (P < 0.048), SHORTER FIRST STAGE OF LABOR (P < 0.0003) IN THE STUDY GROUP PRACTICING YOGA. THE TOLERANCE OF PAIN WAS BETTER IN THE STUDY GROUP AS SHOWN BY NPIS (P < 0.001) AND PBOS SCORES (P < 0.0001). POSTPARTUM, THE MATERNAL COMFORT QUESTIONNAIRE SCORE SHOWED HIGHER COMFORT IN THE STUDY GROUP (P < 0.032). THE NUMBER OF LOW BIRTH WEIGHT BABIES WAS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY LESS IN THE STUDY GROUP (P < 0.042). THERE WERE NO ADVERSE EFFECTS ATTRIBUTED TO YOGA. CONCLUSION: THE STUDY HAS HIGHLIGHTED THAT YOGA IS A NONINVASIVE, EASY TO LEARN MIND-BODY MEDICINE AND COMPLEMENTARY HEALTH PRACTICE, EFFECTIVE IN ALLEVIATION OF LABOR PAIN AND POSSIBLY IMPROVING BIRTH OUTCOME.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
12 2066 53 THE CHARACTERISTICS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF PREGNANCY YOGA INTERVENTIONS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS A POPULAR MIND-BODY MEDICINE FREQUENTLY RECOMMENDED TO PREGNANT WOMEN. GAPS REMAIN IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE CORE COMPONENTS OF EFFECTIVE PREGNANCY YOGA PROGRAMMES. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS EXAMINED THE CHARACTERISTICS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF PREGNANCY YOGA INTERVENTIONS, INCORPORATING THE FITT (FREQUENCY, INTENSITY, TIME/DURATION AND TYPE) PRINCIPLE OF EXERCISE PRESCRIPTION. METHODS: NINE ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE SEARCHED: MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, WHOLIS, AMED, SCIELO, ASSIA AND WEB OF SCIENCE. RANDOMISED CONTROL TRIALS AND QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES EXAMINING PREGNANCY YOGA INTERVENTIONS WERE ELIGIBLE. COVIDENCE WAS USED TO SCREEN TITLES, ABSTRACTS, AND FULL-TEXT ARTICLES. OUTCOMES OF INTEREST WERE STRESS, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, QUALITY OF LIFE, LABOUR DURATION, PAIN MANAGEMENT IN LABOUR AND MODE OF BIRTH. THE COCHRANE COLLABORATION'S RISK OF BIAS ASSESSMENT TOOL WAS USED TO ASSESS METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF STUDIES AND GRADE CRITERIA (GRADEPRO) EVALUATED QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE. META-ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED USING REVMAN 5.3. RESULTS: OF 862 CITATIONS RETRIEVED, 31 STUDIES MET INCLUSION CRITERIA. TWENTY-NINE STUDIES WITH 2217 PREGNANT WOMEN WERE INCLUDED FOR META-ANALYSIS. PREGNANCY YOGA INTERVENTIONS REDUCED ANXIETY (SMD: -0.91; 95% CI: - 1.49 TO - 0.33; P = 0.002), DEPRESSION (SMD: -0.47; 95% CI: - 0.9 TO - 0.04, P = 0.03) AND PERCEIVED STRESS (SMD: -1.03; 95% CI: - 1.55 TO - 0.52; P < 0.001). YOGA INTERVENTIONS ALSO REDUCED DURATION OF LABOUR (MD = - 117.75; 95% CI - 153.80 TO - 81.71, P < 0.001) AND, INCREASED ODDS OF NORMAL VAGINAL BIRTH (OR 2.58; 95% CI 1.46-4.56, P < 0.001) AND TOLERANCE FOR PAIN. THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE (GRADE CRITERIA) WAS LOW TO VERY LOW FOR ALL OUTCOMES. TWELVE OR MORE YOGA SESSIONS DELIVERED WEEKLY/BI-WEEKLY HAD A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON MODE OF BIRTH, WHILE 12 OR MORE YOGA SESSIONS OF LONG DURATION (> 60 MIN) HAD A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PERCEIVED STRESS. CONCLUSION: THE EVIDENCE HIGHLIGHTS POSITIVE EFFECTS OF PREGNANCY YOGA ON ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, PERCEIVED STRESS, MODE OF BIRTH AND DURATION OF LABOUR.

BACKGROUND: THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) HAS SHOWN VARIOUS RESULTS IN DIFFERENT REPORTS. AS A RESULT, PERFORMING A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS TO GUIDE PHYSICIANS AND PATIENTS SEEMS NECESSARY. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH MS. METHOD: THE PRESENT STUDY WAS DESIGNED BASED ON PRISMA GUIDELINES FROM THEIR INCEPTION UNTIL OCTOBER 2019. TWO RESEARCHERS INDEPENDENTLY PERFORMED ALL STEPS. WE SEARCHED SEVERAL INTERNATIONAL ONLINE DATABASES SUCH AS PUBMED/MEDILNE, SCOPUS, SCIENCE DIRECT, COCHRANE LIBRARY, PSYCINFO, WEB OF SCIENCE, CINAHL, CAM-QUEST, CAMBASE, INDMED AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR SEARCH ENGINE. THE DATA WERE ANALYZED USING COMPREHENSIVE META-ANALYSIS SOFTWARE VER. 2, WHILE P < 0.05 WAS CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT. THE PROTOCOL OF THIS META-ANALYSIS WAS REGISTERED AT PROSPERO WITH NUMBER IDENTIFIER: CRD42019127168. RESULTS: OVERALL, 693 PATIENTS WITH MS (YOGA (N = 209), EXERCISE (N = 298), CONTROL (N = 186) GROUPS) WERE EXAMINED IN TEN RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS). ACCORDING TO THIS META-ANALYSIS, THE EFFECT OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH MS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER COMPARED TO THE TYPICAL MS CARE GROUP [SMD = -0.872; 95%CI: -1.467 TO -0.277, P = 0.004], AND DID NOT SHOW SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE COMPARED TO THE EXERCISE GROUP [SMD = -0.093; 95%CI: -0.353 TO 0.167, P = 0.482]. THE EFFECT OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON THE OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE (COMPARED TO THE TYPICAL MS CARE GROUP: [SMD = 0.710; 95%CI: -0.172 TO 1.592, P = 0.114], AND COMPARED TO THE EXERCISE GROUP: [SMD = -0.453; 95%CI: -0.233 TO 1.138, P = 0.195]), PHYSICAL COMPONENT (COMPARED TO THE TYPICAL MS CARE GROUP: [SMD = 0.281; 95%CI: -0.157 TO 0.719, P = 0.209], AND COMPARED TO THE EXERCISE GROUP: [SMD = 0.074; 95%CI: -0.125 TO 0.273, P = 0.467]), PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPONENT (COMPARED TO THE TYPICAL MS CARE GROUP: [SMD = 0.250; 95% CI: - 0.132 TO 0.631, P = 0.199], AND COMPARED TO THE EXERCISE GROUP: [SMD = - 0.270; 95%CI: -0.813 TO 0.272, P = 0.329]), SEXUAL FUNCTION (COMPARED TO THE TYPICAL MS CARE GROUP: [SMD = 0.438; 95%CI: -0.350 TO 1.226, P = 0.276]), AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION (COMPARED TO THE TYPICAL MS CARE GROUP: [SMD = -0.390; 95%CI: -0.008 TO 0.789, P = 0.055]) IN PATIENTS WITH MS WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT. CONCLUSION: YOGA IS A SIMPLE EXERCISE FOR PATIENTS WITH MS THAT IS CAPABLE OF DECREASING FATIGUE IN THESE PATIENTS.	2020

CONCLUSIONS: YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR ALLEVIATING MENSTRUAL PAIN IN WOMEN WITH PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
18 2897 26 [EFFECTS OF A YOGA-FOCUSED PRENATAL PROGRAM ON STRESS, ANXIETY, SELF CONFIDENCE AND LABOR PAIN IN PREGNANT WOMEN WITH IN VITRO FERTILIZATION TREATMENT]. PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO IDENTIFY THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA-FOCUSED PRENATAL PROGRAM ON THE STRESS, ANXIETY, SELF CONFIDENCE AND LABOR PAIN OF PREGNANT WOMEN WHO HAD IN VITRO FERTILIZATION (IVF) TREATMENT. METHODS: A QUASI EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WITH A NON-EQUIVALENT CONTROL GROUP PRETEST-POSTTEST DESIGN WAS USED. THE DATA COLLECTION PERIOD AND MEDITATION PROGRAM WERE BETWEEN JANUARY 9 AND AUGUST 31, 2009. FORTY-SIX WOMEN WHO WERE PREGNANT FOLLOWING IVF, AND WERE BETWEEN 12-20 WEEKS GESTATION, PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY (23 EXPERIMENTAL GROUP, 23 CONTROL GROUP). DATA WERE ANALYZED USING CHI-SQUARE TEST, MANN-WHITNEY U TEST, ANCOVA, AND CRONBACH'S ALPHA COEFFICIENTS WITH THE SPSS 12.0 FOR WINDOWS PROGRAM. RESULTS: ALTHOUGH THE SAMPLE SIZE WAS LIMITED, WOMEN WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE PROGRAM SHOWED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN STRESS, ANXIETY, LABOR PAIN, AND LABOR CONFIDENCE FOR WOMEN PREGNANT AFTER IVF. CONCLUSION: THE RESULT INDICATE THAT THIS 12-WEEK YOGA-FOCUSED EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM CAN BE UTILIZED FOR WOMEN PREGNANT FOLLOWING IVF TO REDUCE THEIR STRESS, ANXIETY, AND LABOR PAIN, AND TO INCREASE DELIVERY CONFIDENCE. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE YOGA-FOCUSED EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM BE OFFERED TO EVERY PREGNANT WOMAN.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
19  534 25 COMPARISON OF YOGA AND WALKING-EXERCISE ON CARDIAC TIME INTERVALS AS A MEASURE OF CARDIAC FUNCTION IN ELDERLY WITH INCREASED PULSE PRESSURE. OBJECTIVE: ARTERIAL AGING ALONG WITH INCREASED BLOOD PRESSURE(BP) HAS BECOME THE MAJOR CARDIOVASCULAR(CV) RISK IN ELDERLY. THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA PROGRAM AND WALKING-EXERCISE ON CARDIAC FUNCTION IN ELDERLY WITH INCREASED PULSE PRESSURE (PP). METHODS: AN OPEN LABEL, PARALLEL-GROUP RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY DESIGN WAS ADOPTED. ELDERLY INDIVIDUALS AGED >/=60 YEARS WITH PP>/=60MMHG WERE RECRUITED FOR THE STUDY. YOGA (STUDY) GROUP (N=30) WAS ASSIGNED FOR YOGA TRAINING AND WALKING (EXERCISE) GROUP (N=30) FOR WALKING WITH LOOSENING PRACTICES FOR ONE HOUR IN THE MORNING FOR 6DAYS IN A WEEK FOR 3 MONTHS. THE OUTCOME MEASURES WERE CARDIAC TIME INTERVALS DERIVED FROM PULSE WAVE ANALYSIS AND ECG: RESTING HEART RATE (RHR), DIASTOLIC TIME(DT), VENTRICULAR EJECTION TIME(LVET), UPSTROKE TIME(UT), EJECTION DURATION INDEX (ED%), PRE-EJECTION PERIOD (PEP), RATE PRESSURE PRODUCT (RPP) AND PERCENTAGE OF MEAN ARTERIAL PRESSURE (%MAP). RESULTS: THE MEAN WITHIN-YOGA GROUP CHANGE IN RHR(BPM) WAS 4.41 (P=0.031), PD(MS): -50.29 (P=0.042), DT(MS): -49.04 (P=0.017), ED%: 2.107 (P=0.001), ES(MMHG/MS): 14.62 (P=0.118), ET(MS): -0.66 (P=0.903), UT(MS): -2.54 (P=0.676), PEP(MS): -1.25 (P=0.11) AND %MAP: 2.08 (P=0.04). THE MEAN WITHIN-CONTROL GROUP CHANGE IN HR (BPM) WAS 0.35 (P=0.887), PD (MS): 11.15(P=0.717), DT (MS): 11.3 (P=0.706), ED%: -0.101 (P=0.936), ES (MMHG/MS): 0.75 (P=0.926), ET(MS): 2.2 (P=0.721), UT(MS):4.7(P=455), PEP (MS): 2.1(P=0.11), %MAP: 0.65 (P=0.451). A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN-GROUP WAS FOUND IN RHR (P=0.036), PD (P=0.02), ED% (P=0.049), LVET (P=0.048), DT (P=0.02) AND RPP (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: YOGA PRACTICE FOR 3 MONTHS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN DIASTOLIC FUNCTION WITH A MINIMAL CHANGE IN SYSTOLIC FUNCTION. YOGA IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN WALKING IN IMPROVING CARDIAC FUNCTION IN ELDERLY WITH HIGH PP.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
20  166 23 A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF INTEGRATED YOGA ON PREGNANCY OUTCOME IN HYPERTENSIVE DISORDER OF PREGNANCY. OBJECTIVE: THE STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF INTEGRATED YOGA ON BLOOD PRESSURE AND PREGNANCY OUTCOME IN HYPERTENSIVE DISORDER OF PREGNANCY. METHODS: SEVENTY-NINE PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO STUDY AND CONTROL GROUPS. THE STUDY GROUP RECEIVED THE INTERVENTION IN THE FORM OF INTEGRATED YOGA FOR 4 WEEKS. FINAL ANALYSIS WAS DONE ON 30 PATIENTS EACH OF STUDY AND CONTROL GROUP. RESULTS: THE MEAN SYSTOLIC BP DECLINED BY 7.43 +/- 5.86 MMHG IN THE STUDY GROUP AS COMPARED TO 2.50 +/- 5.21 MM HG IN THE CONTROL GROUP (P VALUE 0.002). THE MEAN DIASTOLIC BP PRIOR TO DELIVERY WAS 88.00 +/- 3.71 MMHG IN THE STUDY GROUP AND 92.20 +/- 5.02 MMHG IN THE CONTROL GROUP (P = 0.001). THE MATERNAL COMFORT IN LABOR WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AND THE DURATION OF LABOR SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED IN THE STUDY GROUP.

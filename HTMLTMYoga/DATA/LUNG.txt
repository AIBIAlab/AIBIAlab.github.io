1  865 130 EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICES ON PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS INCLUDING TRANSFER FACTOR OF LUNG FOR CARBON MONOXIDE (TLCO) IN ASTHMA PATIENTS. PRANA IS THE ENERGY, WHEN THE SELF-ENERGIZING FORCE EMBRACES THE BODY WITH EXTENSION AND EXPANSION AND CONTROL, IT IS PRANAYAMA. IT MAY AFFECT THE MILIEU AT THE BRONCHIOLES AND THE ALVEOLI PARTICULARLY AT THE ALVEOLO-CAPILLARY MEMBRANE TO FACILITATE DIFFUSION AND TRANSPORT OF GASES. IT MAY ALSO INCREASE OXYGENATION AT TISSUE LEVEL. AIM OF OUR STUDY IS TO COMPARE PULMONARY FUNCTIONS AND DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN PATIENTS OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA BEFORE AND AFTER YOGIC INTERVENTION OF 2 MONTHS. SIXTY STABLE ASTHMATIC-PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS I.E GROUP 1 (YOGA TRAINING GROUP) AND GROUP 2 (CONTROL GROUP). EACH GROUP INCLUDED THIRTY PATIENTS. LUNG FUNCTIONS WERE RECORDED ON ALL PATIENTS AT BASELINE, AND THEN AFTER TWO MONTHS. GROUP 1 SUBJECTS SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT (P<0.001) IN TRANSFER FACTOR OF THE LUNG FOR CARBON MONOXIDE (TLCO), FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1ST SEC (FEV1), PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR), MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION (MVV) AND SLOW VITAL CAPACITY (SVC) AFTER YOGA PRACTICE. QUALITY OF LIFE ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT PRANAYAMA & YOGA BREATHING AND STRETCHING POSTURES ARE USED TO INCREASE RESPIRATORY STAMINA, RELAX THE CHEST MUSCLES, EXPAND THE LUNGS, RAISE ENERGY LEVELS, AND CALM THE BODY.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
2  867  70 EFFECT OF YOGA REGIMEN ON LUNG FUNCTIONS INCLUDING DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE PATIENTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. BACKGROUND: LUNG FUNCTIONS ARE FOUND TO BE IMPAIRED IN CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD), CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE, LEFT VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION, AND AFTER CARDIAC SURGERY. DIFFUSION CAPACITY PROGRESSIVELY WORSENS AS THE SEVERITY OF CAD INCREASES DUE TO REDUCTION IN LUNG TISSUE PARTICIPATING IN GAS EXCHANGE. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISES AND YOGIC POSTURES MAY PLAY AN IMPRESSIVE ROLE IN IMPROVING CARDIO-RESPIRATORY EFFICIENCY AND FACILITATING GAS DIFFUSION AT THE ALVEOLO-CAPILLARY MEMBRANE. THIS STUDY WAS DONE TO SEE THE EFFECT OF YOGA REGIMEN ON LUNG FUNCTIONS PARTICULARLY DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN CAD PATIENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 80 STABLE CAD PATIENTS BELOW 65 YEARS OF AGE OF BOTH SEXES WERE SELECTED AND RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS OF 40 EACH. GROUP I CAD PATIENTS WERE GIVEN YOGA REGIMEN FOR 3 MONTHS WHICH CONSISTED OF YOGIC POSTURES, PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISES, DIETARY MODIFICATION, AND HOLISTIC TEACHING ALONG WITH THEIR CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE WHILE GROUP II CAD PATIENTS WERE PUT ONLY ON CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE. LUNG FUNCTIONS INCLUDING DIFFUSION CAPACITY WERE RECORDED THRICE IN BOTH THE GROUPS: 0 DAY AS BASELINE, 22(ND) DAY AND ON 90(TH) DAY BY USING COMPUTERIZED MS MEDISOFT CARDIO-RESPIRATORY INSTRUMENT, HYP'AIR COMPACT MODEL OF CARDIO-RESPIRATORY TESTING MACHINE WAS MANUFACTURED BY P K MORGAN, INDIA. THE RECORDED PARAMETERS WERE STATISTICALLY ANALYZED BY REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA FOLLOWED BY TUKEY'S TEST IN BOTH THE GROUPS. CARDIOVASCULAR PARAMETERS WERE ALSO COMPARED BEFORE AND AFTER INTERVENTION IN BOTH THE GROUPS. RESULTS: STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE SEEN IN SLOW VITAL CAPACITY, FORCED VITAL CAPACITY, PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE, MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION, AND DIFFUSION FACTOR/ TRANSFER FACTOR OF LUNG FOR CARBON MONOXIDE AFTER 3 MONTHS OF YOGA REGIMEN IN GROUP I. FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1(ST) SEC (FEV1), AND FEV1 % ALSO SHOWED A TREND TOWARD IMPROVEMENT ALTHOUGH NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. HR, SBP AND DBP ALSO SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN GROUP-I PATIENTS WHO FOLLOWED YOGA REGIMEN. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA REGIMEN WAS FOUND TO IMPROVE LUNG FUNCTIONS AND DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN CAD PATIENTS BESIDES IMPROVING CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTIONS. THUS, IT CAN BE USED AS A COMPLIMENTARY OR ADJUNCT THERAPY ALONG WITH THE CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE FOR THEIR TREATMENT AND REHABILITATION.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
3  214  55 A STUDY OF THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA. THE ROLE OF YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES, AS AN ADJUNCT TREATMENT FOR BRONCHIAL ASTHMA IS WELL RECOGNIZED. ONE HUNDRED TWENTY PATIENTS OF ASTHMA WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS I.E GROUP A (YOGA TRAINING GROUP) AND GROUP B (CONTROL GROUP). EACH GROUP INCLUDED SIXTY PATIENTS. PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS WERE PERFORMED ON ALL THE PATIENTS AT BASELINE, AFTER 4 WEEKS AND THEN AFTER 8 WEEKS. MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS IN THE TWO GROUPS HAD MILD DISEASE (34 PATIENTS IN GROUP A AND 32 IN GROUP B). GROUP A SUBJECTS SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASING TREND (P < 0.01) IN % PREDICTED PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN THE FIRST SECOND (FEV1), FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), FORCED MID EXPIRATORY FLOW IN 0.25-0.75 SECONDS (FEF25-75) AND FEV1/FVC% RATIO AT 4 WEEKS AND 8 WEEKS AS COMPARED TO GROUP B. THUS, YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES USED ADJUNCTIVELY WITH STANDARD PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA.	2009

5  792  40 EFFECT OF YOGA IN CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE. YOGA IS ADJUNCTIVELY UTILIZED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN THE TREATMENT OF A VARIETY OF DISEASES, INCLUDING CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD), BUT THERE ARE NO STUDIES ASSESSING ITS ADJUNCTIVE EFFICACY IN THE UNITED STATES. WE PROSPECTIVELY EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA TRAINING ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AND THE PARAMETERS OF LUNG FUNCTION IN PATIENTS WITH COPD. THIRTY-THREE PATIENTS WITH DOCUMENTED COPD, PER GLOBAL INITIATIVE FOR OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE CRITERIA, WERE RECRUITED. ALL PATIENTS RECEIVED STANDARD COPD CARE. THE QOL WAS ASSESSED BY THE ST. GEORGE RESPIRATORY QUESTIONNAIRE. STANDARD SPIROMETRY AND MAXIMUM INSPIRATORY (MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE) AND EXPIRATORY PRESSURE (MAXIMAL EXPIRATORY PRESSURE) WERE MEASURED. PATIENTS WERE TAUGHT SELECTED YOGA EXERCISES INCLUDING BREATHING EXERCISES, MEDITATION, AND YOGA POSTURES FOR 1 HOUR, THRICE A WEEK FOR 6 WEEKS BY A CERTIFIED YOGA THERAPIST. THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND LUNG FUNCTION WERE AGAIN ASSESSED AT THE END OF 6 WEEKS. TWENTY-TWO PATIENTS COMPLETED THE STUDY. DIFFERENCES IN PREYOGA VERSUS POSTYOGA SCORES WERE EVALUATED USING PAIRED T-TESTS. STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS (P < 0.05) WERE OBSERVED FOR THE ST.

6  880  46 EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON HANDGRIP, RESPIRATORY PRESSURES AND PULMONARY FUNCTION. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REPORTS ON THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS, VERY FEW STUDIES HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN ON THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON RESPIRATORY PRESSURES AND HANDGRIP ENDURANCE. HENCE THE PRESENT WORK WAS PLANNED TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON HAND GRIP STRENGTH (HGS), HAND GRIP ENDURANCE (HGE), MAXIMUM EXPIRATORY PRESSURE (MEP), MAXIMUM INSPIRATORY PRESSURE (MIP), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME (FEV), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN FIRST SECOND (FEV1) AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR). 20 SCHOOL CHILDREN IN THE AGE GROUP OF 12 TO 15 YEARS WERE GIVEN YOGA TRAINING (ASANS AND PRANAYAMS) FOR 6 MONTHS. 20 AGE AND GENDER-MATCHED STUDENTS FORMED THE CONTROL GROUP. YOGA TRAINING PRODUCED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.05) INCREASE IN HGS AND HGE. MEP, MIP, FEV, FEV1 AND PEFR ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (P < 0.001) AFTER THE YOGA TRAINING. IN CONTRAST, THE INCREASE IN THESE PARAMETERS IN THE CONTROL GROUP WAS STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT. OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT YOGA TRAINING FOR 6 MONTHS IMPROVES LUNG FUNCTION, STRENGTH OF INSPIRATORY AND EXPIRATORY MUSCLES AS WELL AS SKELETAL MUSCLE STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT YOGA BE INTRODUCED AT SCHOOL LEVEL IN ORDER TO IMPROVE PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS, OVERALL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE OF STUDENTS.	2003	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
7 2446  30 YOGA AND TAI CHI: A MIND-BODY APPROACH IN MANAGING RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS IN OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASES. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD) IS CHARACTERIZED BY AIRFLOW LIMITATION BECAUSE OF AIRWAY AND/OR ALVEOLAR ABNORMALITIES. SYMPTOMS INCLUDE DYSPNEA, COUGH, CHRONIC SPUTUM PRODUCTION. AS THE THIRD-RANKED CAUSE OF DEATH AS WELL AS DISABILITY-ADJUSTED LIFE YEARS (DALYS), IT POSES A SIGNIFICANT BURDEN ON PATIENTS, FAMILIES, HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND SOCIETY. REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS LINKED TO DECREASE IN MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY ASSOCIATED WITH COPD, BUT IMPLEMENTATION REMAINS CHALLENGING. THERE IS A NEED FOR COMMUNITY-BASED INTERVENTIONS THAT PROMOTE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. YOGA AND TAI CHI ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE IN THE COMMUNITY AND HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE BENEFICIAL IN PATIENTS WITH COPD AS WELL AS MANY OF THE CO-MORBID CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH COPD. RECENT FINDINGS: YOGA AND TAI CHI HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN USUAL CARE IN COPD WITH CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL IMPROVEMENTS IN 6-MIN WALK DISTANCE (6MWD), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1 S (FEV1), AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL). THEY HAVE ALSO BEEN FOUND TO BE COMPARABLE TO PULMONARY REHABILITATION INTERVENTIONS. SUMMARY: YOGA AND TAI CHI PROVIDE COMMUNITY-BASED OPTIONS FOR PATIENTS WITH COPD TO IMPROVE THEIR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND PULMONARY FUNCTION.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
8  786  43 EFFECT OF YOGA BREATHING (PRANAYAMA) ON EXERCISE TOLERANCE IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE: A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: PULMONARY REHABILITATION IMPROVES EXERCISE TOLERANCE IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD). HOWEVER, MANY PATIENTS DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO PULMONARY REHABILITATION PROGRAMS. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT AN ALTERNATIVE TO PULMONARY REHABILITATION TO IMPROVE EXERCISE TOLERANCE IS THE PRACTICE OF PRANAYAMA, OR YOGA BREATHING, WHICH COULD BE DONE INDEPENDENTLY AT HOME. WE ALSO SOUGHT TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOGA NONPROFESSIONALS COULD ADEQUATELY TEACH PRANAYAMA TO PATIENTS. DESIGN: PROOF-OF-CONCEPT, RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE-BLIND, CONTROLLED PILOT TRIAL. SETTINGS/LOCATION: TWO ACADEMIC PULMONARY PRACTICES. SUBJECTS: FORTY-THREE PATIENTS WITH SYMPTOMATIC, MODERATE-TO-SEVERE COPD. INTERVENTIONS: TWELVE WEEKS OF PRANAYAMA PLUS EDUCATION VERSUS EDUCATION ALONE. TWO YOGA PROFESSIONALS TRAINED THE RESEARCH COORDINATORS TO CONDUCT ALL PRANAYAMA TEACHING AND MONITORED THE QUALITY OF THE TEACHING AND THE PRACTICE OF PRANAYAMA BY STUDY PARTICIPANTS. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS A CHANGE IN THE 6-MIN WALK DISTANCE (6MWD). SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED CHANGES IN LUNG FUNCTION, MARKERS OF OXIDATIVE STRESS AND SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION, AND MEASURES OF DYSPNEA AND QUALITY OF LIFE. RESULTS: THE 6MWD INCREASED IN THE PRANAYAMA GROUP (LEAST SQUARE MEAN [95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL] = 28 M [-5 TO 61]) AND DECREASED IN THE CONTROL GROUP (-15 M [-47 TO 16]), WITH A NEARLY SIGNIFICANT TREATMENT EFFECT (P = 0.06) IN FAVOR OF PRANAYAMA. PRANAYAMA ALSO RESULTED IN SMALL IMPROVEMENTS IN INSPIRATORY CAPACITY AND AIR TRAPPING. BOTH GROUPS HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN VARIOUS MEASURES OF SYMPTOMS, BUT NO OVERALL DIFFERENCES IN RESPIRATORY SYSTEM IMPEDANCE OR MARKERS OF OXIDATIVE STRESS OR SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION. CONCLUSION: THIS PILOT STUDY SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED THAT PRANAYAMA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED EXERCISE TOLERANCE IN PATIENTS WITH COPD. LAY PERSONNEL WERE ABLE TO ADEQUATELY TEACH PATIENTS TO PRACTICE PRANAYAMA. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT PRANAYAMA MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT CLINICAL BENEFITS FOR SYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS WITH COPD, A CONCEPT THAT NEEDS TO BE CONFIRMED IN FUTURE, LARGER CLINICAL TRIALS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
9 2803  22 YOGA THERAPY IN CHRONIC BRONCHITIS. FIFTEEN PATIENTS OF CHRONIC BRONCHITIS RECEIVED YOGA THERAPY IN THE FORM OF PRANAYAM AND 8 TYPES OF 'ASANS' FOR A PERIOD OF 4 WEEKS. THEY HAD A PERCEPTIBLE IMPROVEMENT IN DYSPNOEA AS WAS MEASURED BY VISUAL ANALOG. LUNG FUNCTION PARAMETERS (VC, FEV1, AND PEFR) ALSO IMPROVED AFTER THE PRACTICE OF YOGA. THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY INDICATES THAT, YOGA MAY BE AN USEFUL ADJUNCT TO OTHER CONVENTIONAL FORM OF THERAPY FOR COPD.	1998

REDUCTION OF CIGARETTE CONSUMPTION IN PATIENTS WITH LUNG CANCER CANDIDATES FOR THE SURGERY COULD LIMIT THE IMPACT OF TOBACCO ON POSTSURGICAL OUTCOMES. BREATHING EXERCISES APPEAR TO HELP COMBAT CIGARETTE CRAVINGS. YOGA EXERCISE BENEFITS HAVE BEEN STUDIED IN LUNG CANCER SURVIVORS, RATHER THAN IN THE PREOPERATIVE SETTING. IN THIS STUDY, WE HAVE RECRUITED 32 ACTIVE SMOKERS AFFECTED BY LUNG CANCER AND BEING CANDIDATES FOR PULMONARY SURGERY. THE PATIENTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO TWO GROUPS: ONE TREATED BY STANDARD BREATHING AND THE OTHER TREATED BY YOGA BREATHING (YB). THE GROUPS WERE EVALUATED AT TIMES T0 (BASELINE) AND T1 (AFTER 7 DAYS OF TREATMENT) TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF THE TWO BREATHING TREATMENTS ON PULMONARY PERFORMANCE IN A PRESURGERY SETTING. PULMONARY AND CARDIOCIRCULATORY FUNCTIONS HAVE BEEN TESTED USING A SELF-CALIBRATING COMPUTERIZED SPIROMETER AND A PORTABLE PULSE OXIMETRY DEVICE. THE FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE APPRECIABLE SHORT-TERM IMPROVEMENT IN LUNG FUNCTION ASSESSED BY SPIROMETRY. WE CONCLUDE THAT YOGA BREATHING CAN BE A BENEFICIAL PREOPERATIVE SUPPORT FOR THORACIC SURGERY.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
11 2344  39 USING A STANDARDIZED VINIYOGA PROTOCOL FOR LUNG CANCER SURVIVORS: A PILOT STUDY EXAMINING EFFECTS ON BREATHING EASE. ALTHOUGH LUNG CANCER IS PERCEIVED AS A DIRE DIAGNOSIS, INCREASES IN THE 5-YEAR SURVIVAL RATE OF INDIVIDUALS WITH NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER (NSCLC) HAVE BEEN REPORTED. SURVIVORS, HOWEVER, CONTINUE TO BE EXCESSIVELY BURDENED WITH SYMPTOMS SUCH AS RESPIRATORY DISTRESS WHICH INTERFERE WITH FUNCTIONING AND QUALITY OF LIFE. WHILE EXERCISE AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ARE STRONGLY RECOMMENDED, NSCLC SURVIVORS MAY BE RELUCTANT TO PARTICIPATE DUE TO ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED SHORTNESS OF BREATH EXACERBATED WITH MOVEMENT.THIS QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL, INTERVENTION-ONLY PILOT STUDY AIMED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF AN 8-WEEK STANDARDIZED YOGA PROTOCOL FOR STAGE I-IIIA NSCLC SURVIVORS (N=9). THE PROTOCOL WAS DEVELOPED WITHIN THE VINIYOGA (HATHA) TRADITION WITH RESPIRATORY EXPERTS. BREATHING EASE, DYSPNEA, OXYGEN SATURATION, AND RESPIRATORY FUNCTION WERE EXPLORED IN RELATIONSHIP TO YOGA PRACTICE (45-MINUTE SESSIONS ONCE PER WEEK AND HOME PRACTICE) USING REPEATED-MEASURES ANALYSIS. NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS REPORTING DYSPNEA RANGED FROM 25 TO 50% PRIOR TO PRACTICE WITH NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASE DURING SESSIONS, AND MODERATE DECREASES NOTED AT TIMES. OXYGEN SATURATION REMAINED HIGH AND VITAL SIGNS STABLE; FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1 SECOND (FEV1) VALUES INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE 14-WEEK STUDY PERIOD (P<0.0001). YOGA, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON POSTURES COORDINATED WITH BREATHING AND MEDITATION PRACTICES, OFFERS A POTENTIALLY FEASIBLE AND BENEFICIAL OPTION THAT REQUIRES FURTHER STUDY IN THIS POPULATION.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
12 2006  55 STUDY OF THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE PATIENTS: A CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: PATIENTS OF CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD) ARE AT HIGH RISK FOR DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY. YOGA TECHNIQUES ARE SUITED FOR PROMOTING RELAXATION, PSYCHO-EMOTIONAL STABILITY AND EXERCISE TOLERANCE. STUDIES SHOWING THE EFFECT OF YOGA IN DIFFUSION CAPACITY ARE NOT AVAILABLE; HENCE THIS STUDY WAS PLANNED. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON 60 DIAGNOSED STABLE MILD-TO-MODERATE COPD PATIENTS IN THE AGE GROUP OF 30-60 YEARS, OF EITHER SEX, IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSIOLOGY. PATIENTS WERE TAKEN FROM GURU TEG BAHADUR HOSPITAL, DELHI AND DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: CONTROL AND THE YOGA GROUP. BOTH THE GROUPS WERE ON CONVENTIONAL DRUG THERAPY. SUBJECTS FROM THE YOGA GROUP WAS CALLED TO CARDIOPULMONARY LABORATORY DAILY FOR 21 DAYS AND THEN WEEKLY FOR THE COMPLIANCE. YOGA INSTRUCTOR TAUGHT THEM THE TECHNIQUE OF PRANAYAMA AND VARIOUS POSTURES EVERY DAY. THEY PRACTICED YOGA AT HOME FOR 2 MONTHS FOR 45 MIN IN THE MORNINGS. DIFFUSION CAPACITY WAS RECORDED BY USING COMPUTERIZED MEDISOFT INSTRUMENT (HYPAIR COMPACT), IN BOTH THE GROUPS BEFORE AND AFTER 2 MONTHS. RESULTS: STATISTICAL ANALYSIS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN TLCO OF THE YOGA GROUP. TRANSFER FACTOR OF LUNG FOR CARBON MONOXIDE I.E. TLCO IN MILD COPD INCREASED FROM 17.61 +/- 4.55 TO 19.08 +/- 5.09 ML/MMHG/MIN, AND IN MODERATE COPD IT INCREASED FROM 14.99 +/- 4.02 TO17.35 +/- 3.97 ML/MMHG/MIN. CONCLUSION: IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT YOGIC BREATHING EXERCISES IMPROVE DIFFUSION CAPACITY. THEY ARE BENEFICIAL TO COPD PATIENTS AND THEY CAN BE USED AS AN ADJUNCT THERAPY WITH THE CONVENTIONAL MEDICAL THERAPY.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
13 2870  34 YOGA-BASED PULMONARY REHABILITATION FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF DYSPNEA IN COAL MINERS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: COAL MINE DUST EXPOSURE CAUSES CHRONIC AIRFLOW LIMITATION IN COAL MINERS RESULTING IN DYSPNEA, FATIGUE, AND EVENTUALLY CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD). YOGA CAN ALLEVIATE DYSPNEA IN COPD BY IMPROVING VENTILATORY MECHANICS, REDUCING CENTRAL NEURAL DRIVE, AND PARTIALLY RESTORING NEUROMECHANICAL COUPLING OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM. OBJECTIVES: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY (IAYT) IN THE MANAGEMENT OF DYSPNEA AND FATIGUE IN COAL MINERS WITH COPD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RANDOMIZED, WAITLIST CONTROLLED, SINGLE-BLIND CLINICAL TRIAL. EIGHTY-ONE COAL MINERS (36-60 YEARS) WITH STABLE STAGES II AND III COPD WERE RECRUITED. THE YOGA GROUP RECEIVED AN IAYT MODULE FOR COPD THAT INCLUDED ASANAS, LOOSENING EXERCISES, BREATHING PRACTICES, PRANAYAMA, CYCLIC MEDITATION, YOGIC COUNSELING AND LECTURES 90 MIN/DAY, 6 DAYS/WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS. MEASUREMENTS OF DYSPNEA AND FATIGUE ON THE BORG SCALE, EXERCISE CAPACITY BY THE 6 MIN WALK TEST, PERIPHERAL CAPILLARY OXYGEN SATURATION (SPO2%), AND PULSE RATE (PR) USING PULSE OXIMETRY WERE MADE BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION. RESULTS: STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT WITHIN GROUP REDUCTIONS IN DYSPNEA (P < 0.001), FATIGUE (P < 0.001) SCORES, PR (P < 0.001), AND SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN SPO2% (P < 0.001) AND 6 MIN WALK DISTANCE (P < 0.001) WERE OBSERVED IN THE YOGA GROUP; ALL EXCEPT THE LAST WERE SIGNIFICANT COMPARED TO CONTROLS (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS INDICATE THAT IAYT BENEFITS COAL MINERS WITH COPD, REDUCING DYSPNEA; FATIGUE AND PR, AND IMPROVING FUNCTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND PERIPHERAL CAPILLARY SPO2%. YOGA CAN NOW BE INCLUDED AS AN ADJUNCT TO CONVENTIONAL THERAPY FOR PULMONARY REHABILITATION PROGRAMS FOR COPD PATIENTS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
14 1520  57 IS YOGA TRAINING BENEFICIAL FOR EXERCISE-INDUCED BRONCHOCONSTRICTION? BACKGROUND: SOME STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH BRONCHIAL HYPERREACTIVITY WITH REGARD TO (1) A REDUCTION IN THE USE OF RESCUE MEDICATION, (2) AN INCREASE IN EXERCISE CAPACITY, AND (3) AN IMPROVEMENT IN LUNG FUNCTION. DESPITE THE FACT THAT YOGA IS PROMISING AS A NEW TREATMENT FOR PEDIATRIC PATIENTS, FURTHER STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO ASSESS THE USE OF THIS TRAINING FOR ASTHMA MANAGEMENT. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY WAS PERFORMED TO ASSESS THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA IN EXERCISE-INDUCED BRONCHOCONSTRICTION (EIB) IN CHILDREN. DESIGN: THE STUDY WAS PROSPECTIVE, WITH NO CONTROL GROUP. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY CHOSEN AMONG THE NEW PATIENTS AT THE UNIT. SETTING: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN THE ERCIYES UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, PEDIATRIC ALLERGY UNIT, IN KAYSERI, TURKEY. PARTICIPANTS: TWO GROUPS OF ASTHMATIC CHILDREN AGED 6-17 Y WERE ENROLLED IN THE STUDY: (1) CHILDREN WITH POSITIVE RESPONSES TO AN EXERCISE CHALLENGE (N = 10), AND (2) THOSE WITH NEGATIVE RESPONSES (N = 10). INTERVENTION: BOTH GROUPS ATTENDED 1-H SESSIONS OF YOGA TRAINING 2 X/WK FOR 3 MO. OUTCOME MEASURES: RESEARCHERS ADMINISTERED SPIROMETRIC MEASUREMENT TO ALL CHILDREN BEFORE AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER PARTICIPATING IN AN EXERCISE CHALLENGE. THIS PROCESS WAS PERFORMED AT BASELINE AND AT THE STUDY'S END. AGE, GENDER, IGE LEVELS, EOSINOPHIL NUMBERS, AND SPIROMETRIC MEASUREMENT PARAMETERS INCLUDING FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1 SEC (FEV1), FORCED EXPIRATORY FLOW 25%-75% (FEF25%-75%), FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW PERCENTAGE (PEF%), AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR) WERE COMPARED USING THE MANN-WHITNEY U TEST AND THE WILCOXON TEST. A P VALUE < .05 WAS CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT. RESULTS: AT BASELINE, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED BETWEEN THE GROUPS REGARDING DEMOGRAPHICS OR PRE-EXERCISE SPIROMETRIC MEASUREMENTS (P > .05, MANN-WHITNEY U TEST). LIKEWISE, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN SPIROMETRIC MEASUREMENTS EXISTED BETWEEN THE GROUPS REGARDING THE CHANGE IN RESPONSES TO AN EXERCISE CHALLENGE AFTER YOGA TRAINING (P > .05, WILCOXON TEST). FOR THE EXERCISE-RESPONSE-POSITIVE GROUP, THE RESEARCH TEAM OBSERVED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN MAXIMUM FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME 1% (FEV1%) FALL FOLLOWING THE EXERCISE CHALLENGE AFTER YOGA TRAINING (P > .05, WILCOXON TEST). ALL EXERCISE-RESPONSE-POSITIVE ASTHMATICS BECAME EXERCISERESPONSE-NEGATIVE ASTHMATICS AFTER YOGA TRAINING. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT TRAINING CHILDREN IN THE PRACTICE OF YOGA HAD BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON EIB. IT IS THE RESEARCH TEAM'S OPINION THAT YOGA TRAINING CAN SUPPLEMENT DRUG THERAPY TO ACHIEVE BETTER CONTROL OF ASTHMA.	2014	

15 2662  44 YOGA IN BURN: ROLE OF PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISE ON PULMONARY FUNCTION, RESPIRATORY MUSCLE ACTIVITY AND EXERCISE TOLERANCE IN FULL-THICKNESS CIRCUMFERENTIAL BURNS OF THE CHEST. BACKGROUND: CIRCUMFERENTIAL BURN OF CHEST (CBC) IS A SIGNIFICANT TYPE OF BURN AND CONSIDERS AS A MAJOR CAUSE OF RESTRICTIVE LUNG DISEASE (RLD). PATIENT WHO HAS CBC WITH RLD LEADS TO RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS SUCH AS BREATHING DIFFICULTY, AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION, REDUCED EXERCISE CAPACITY AND ALTERED PULMONARY FUNCTIONS. HOWEVER, STUDIES EXAMINING THE ROLE OF PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISE ON PULMONARY FUNCTION, RESPIRATORY MUSCLE ACTIVITY AND EXERCISE TOLERANCE IN FULL THICKNESS CIRCUMFERENTIAL BURN OF CHEST ARE LACKING. OBJECTIVE: TO FIND THE SHORT TERM EFFECTS OF PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISE ON PULMONARY FUNCTION, RESPIRATORY MUSCLE ACTIVITY AND EXERCISE TOLERANCE IN FULL THICKNESS CIRCUMFERENTIAL BURNS OF CHEST. METHODS: THROUGH SIMPLE RANDOM SAMPLING METHOD THIRTY SUBJECTS (N = 30) WITH RLD FOLLOWING CBC WERE ALLOCATED TO PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISE GROUP (PBE-G; N = 15) AND CONVENTIONAL BREATHING EXERCISE GROUP (CBE-G; N = 15). THEY RECEIVED PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISE AND CONVENTIONAL BREATHING EXERCISE FOR 4 WEEKS RESPECTIVELY. ALL THE SUBJECTS RECEIVED CHEST MOBILITY EXERCISE AS COMMON TREATMENT. PRIMARY (NUMERIC PAIN RATING SCALE - NPRS, FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME (FEV1), FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC) AND MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION (MVV) AND SECONDARY (ELECTROMYOGRAM OF STERNOCLEIDOMASTOID, SCALENE, EXTERNAL INTERCOSTAL AND DIAPHRAGM MUSCLE, 6 MIN WALK TEST & GLOBAL RATING OF CHANGE - GRC) OUTCOME MEASURES WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE, AFTER FOUR WEEKS AND AFTER THREE MONTHS FOLLOW UP. RESULTS: BASELINE DEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL VARIABLES SHOW HOMOGENOUS DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN THE GROUPS (P > 0.05). FOUR WEEKS FOLLOWING DIFFERENT BREATHING EXERCISES, PBE-G GROUP SHOWS MORE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PAIN INTENSITY, PULMONARY FUNCTION, RESPIRATORY MUSCLE ACTIVITY, EXERCISE TOLERANCE AND GLOBAL RATING OF CHANGE THAN CBE-G GROUP (P </= 0.05) AT FOUR WEEKS AND THREE MONTHS FOLLOW UP. CONCLUSION: BOTH GROUPS SHOWED IMPROVEMENT OVER TIME. HOWEVER, DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GROUPS WERE NOTICED SMALL. STILL PHYSIOTHERAPY MANAGEMENT, WHICH INCLUDED PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISES WITH CHEST MOBILIZATION PROGRAM, HAD AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY IN THE TREATMENT OF RESTRICTIVE LUNG DISEASE FOLLOWING CIRCUMFERENTIAL BURN OF CHEST.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
16 2786  46 YOGA THERAPY AS AN ADJUVANT IN MANAGEMENT OF ASTHMA. OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON CONTROL OF ASTHMA IN CHILDREN WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA. METHODS: THIS HOSPITAL-BASED INTERVENTIONAL RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL CONDUCTED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PEDIATRICS AT A TERTIARY CARE CENTER OF NORTH INDIA FROM NOVEMBER 2017 TO OCTOBER 2018 ENROLLED 140 NEWLY DIAGNOSED CASES OF ASTHMA OF AGE 10-16 Y WHO WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS. SEVENTY CHILDREN IN THE CASE GROUP PRACTICED YOGA UNDER SUPERVISION FOR A PERIOD OF 3 MO IN ADDITION TO PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT. SEVENTY CONTROLS RECEIVED ONLY PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT. PULMONARY-FUNCTION TESTS WERE DONE AT BASELINE, 6 WK, AND 12 WK ALONG WITH QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) ASSESSMENT BY PEDIATRIC ASTHMA QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE (PAQLQ). THE OUTCOME MEASURES ASSESSED WERE FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN ONE SECOND (FEV1), FEV1/FVC AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR). QOL EVALUATION WAS DONE IN 3 DOMAINS: ACTIVITY LIMITATION, SYMPTOMS, AND EMOTIONAL FUNCTION. RESULTS: THE ASTHMATIC CHILDREN PRACTICING YOGA HAVE SHOWN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC AND PEFR WHICH WAS BETTER AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS. IMPROVEMENT WAS ALSO NOTED IN MEAN-PAQLQ SCORE IN CASES WHICH WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS. CONCLUSION: YOGA APPEARS TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECT ON CONTROL OF ASTHMA MEASURED BY PULMONARY-FUNCTION TEST AND QOL. THEREFORE YOGA THERAPY CAN BE RECOMMENDED AS AN ADJUVANT IN MANAGEMENT OF ASTHMA ALONG WITH STANDARD PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
17  787  40 EFFECT OF YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES (PRANAYAMA) ON AIRWAY REACTIVITY IN SUBJECTS WITH ASTHMA. THE EFFECTS OF TWO PRANAYAMA YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES ON AIRWAY REACTIVITY, AIRWAY CALIBRE, SYMPTOM SCORES, AND MEDICATION USE IN PATIENTS WITH MILD ASTHMA WERE ASSESSED IN A RANDOMISED, DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, CROSSOVER TRIAL. AFTER BASELINE ASSESSMENT OVER 1 WEEK, 18 PATIENTS WITH MILD ASTHMA PRACTISED SLOW DEEP BREATHING FOR 15 MIN TWICE A DAY FOR TWO CONSECUTIVE 2-WEEK PERIODS. DURING THE ACTIVE PERIOD, SUBJECTS WERE ASKED TO BREATHE THROUGH A PINK CITY LUNG (PCL) EXERCISER--A DEVICE WHICH IMPOSES SLOWING OF BREATHING AND A 1:2 INSPIRATION:EXPIRATION DURATION RATIO EQUIVALENT TO PRANAYAMA BREATHING METHODS; DURING THE CONTROL PERIOD, SUBJECTS BREATHED THROUGH A MATCHED PLACEBO DEVICE. MEAN FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1 S (FEV1), PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE, SYMPTOM SCORE, AND INHALER USE OVER THE LAST 3 DAYS OF EACH TREATMENT PERIOD WERE ASSESSED IN COMPARISON WITH THE BASELINE ASSESSMENT PERIOD; ALL IMPROVED MORE WITH THE PCL EXERCISER THAN WITH THE PLACEBO DEVICE, BUT THE DIFFERENCES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT. THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE DOSE OF HISTAMINE NEEDED TO PROVOKE A 20% REDUCTION IN FEV1 (PD20) DURING PRANAYAMA BREATHING BUT NOT WITH THE PLACEBO DEVICE. THE USEFULNESS OF CONTROLLED VENTILATION EXERCISES IN THE CONTROL OF ASTHMA SHOULD BE FURTHER INVESTIGATED.	1990	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
18 1123  35 EFFICACY OF NATUROPATHY AND YOGA IN BRONCHIAL ASTHMA. THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF A ONE MONTH IN-PATIENT NATUROPATHY AND YOGA PROGRAMME FOR PATIENTS WITH ASTHMA. RETROSPECTIVE DATA OF 159 BRONCHIAL ASTHMA PATIENTS, UNDERGOING THE NATUROPATHY AND YOGA PROGRAMME, WAS ANALYZED FOR FORCED VITAL CAPACITY, FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME AT THE END OF 1 SECOND, MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE ON ADMISSION, 11TH DAY, ON DISCHARGE AND ONCE IN THREE MONTHS FOR THREE YEARS. THE PAIRED SAMPLE T TEST RESULTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE FORCED VITAL CAPACITY AND FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME FROM THE DATE OF ADMISSION UP TO 6TH MONTH (P < 0.0035) POST BONFERRONI CORRECTION. MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FROM ADMISSION TILL THE DATE OF DISCHARGE (P < 0.0035) AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FROM ADMISSION TILL THE 36TH MONTH OF FOLLOW-UP (P < 0.0035), POST BONFERRONI CORRECTION. THIS VALIDATED THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF COMBINING NATUROPATHY AND YOGA FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
19 1139  23 EFFICACY OF YOGA TRAINING IN CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE PATIENTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVES: TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF YOGA TRAINING IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD). METHOD: A LITERATURE SEARCH WAS PERFORMED IN PUBMED, COCHRANE LIBRARY, EMBASE, CINAHL, AND WEB OF SCIENCE FOR RELEVANT STUDIES PUBLISHED BEFORE JUNE 2017. QUALITY ASSESSMENT, SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS AND HETEROGENEITY WERE PERFORMED. STATA12.0 SOFTWARE WAS USED FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. RESULTS: TEN STUDIES WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS ANALYSIS. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN 6MWD (P = 0.000), BORG SCALE SCORES (P = 0.018), FEV1 VALUE (P = 0. 013), PACO2 (P = 0.037), SGRQ SCORES (P = 0. 000) AND CAT SCORES (P = 0.009) IN YOGA TRAINING PATIENTS. NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED IN THE FEV1/FVC (P = 0.75), FEV1 PREDICTED VALUE (P = 0.057) AND FVC (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: THIS META-ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT YOGA TRAINING CAN BE AN ACCEPTABLE AND APPROPRIATED ADJUNCTIVE REHABILITATION PROGRAM FOR COPD PATIENTS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
20  878  44 EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING AND DETRAINING ON RESPIRATORY MUSCLE STRENGTH IN PRE-PUBERTAL CHILDREN: A RANDOMIZED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN I(ST) SECOND (FEV1), PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR), FEVI/FVC RATIO, AND PULMONARY PRESSURES [MAXIMUM INSPIRATORY PRESSURE (MIP), MAXIMUM EXPIRATORY PRESSURE (MEP) AT THE END OF 3 MONTHS YOGA TRAINING AND THE DETRAINING EFFECT ON THE ABOVE PARAMETERS IN 7-9-YEARS-OLD SCHOOL GOING CHILDREN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 100 PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED FROM A SCHOOL IN BANGALORE. AFTER BASELINE ASSESSMENTS, THE PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO EITHER YOGA OR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY GROUP. INTERVENTION WAS GIVEN FOR 3 MONTHS, AND MEASURES OF PULMONARY FUNCTION AND PULMONARY PRESSURES WERE DETERMINED IMMEDIATELY POST-INTERVENTION AND AT 3-MONTHS FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: ALTHOUGH SIGNIFICANT INCREASE WAS OBSERVED IN FVC, FEV1, PEFR, FEV1/FVC, MIP, AND MEP AT POST-INTERVENTION, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO STUDY GROUPS AFTER ADJUSTING FOR HEIGHT AND AGE POST TRAINING . HOWEVER, MIP INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN BOTH THE GROUPS POST-INTERVENTION, BUT THE YOGA GROUP PERFORMED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE PE GROUP. THE EFFECTS OF TRAINING DID NOT FADE OFF EVEN AFTER 3 MONTHS OF DETRAINING. IN FACT, THE FVC AND FEV1 CONTINUED TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY. A TREND OF DECREASE WAS OBSERVED IN PEFR, MIP, AND MEP. HOWEVER, THE VALUES DID NOT REGRESS TO THE BASELINE VALUE. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT PRACTICE OF YOGA FOR A SHORT DURATION (3 MONTHS) OF TIME CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE RESPIRATORY MUSCLE STRENGTH IN PEDIATRIC POPULATION.	2014

1 2288 112 THE YOGA MAT TECHNIQUE IN POSTLESS HIP ARTHROSCOPY. HIP ARTHROSCOPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF FEMOROACETABULAR IMPINGEMENT SYNDROME WITH ANTI-SLIDING TECHNIQUES AND WITHOUT THE USE OF A PERINEAL POST TO ACHIEVE HIP DISTRACTION HAS INCREASED GREATLY IN THE PAST 5 TO 10 YEARS. TO ACCESS THE HIP JOINT, DISTRACTION IS MANDATORY TO TREAT INTRA-ARTICULAR DISORDERS SUCH AS LABRAL TEARS, ACETABULAR CARTILAGE DEFECTS, LOOSE BODIES, LIGAMENTUM TERES TEARS, AND AVASCULAR NECROSIS OF THE HIP. IN HIP DISTRACTION, COUNTER-DISTRACTION IS NEEDED, AND THIS IS ACHIEVED WITH A BULKY AND CUSHIONED PERINEAL POST. MOST OF THE DESCRIBED TECHNIQUES IN HIP ARTHROSCOPY WORLDWIDE USE A PERINEAL POST, BUT IATROGENIC PUDENDAL NERVE, GENITAL LACERATIONS, HEMATOMAS, AND GROIN COMPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO OCCUR. IN LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, DISPOSABLE HIP PAD DEVICES ARE EXPENSIVE, AND NOT ALL THE ARTHROSCOPIC COMPANIES PROVIDE THEM. OUR YOGA MAT TECHNIQUE PROVIDES ENOUGH COUNTERTRACTION TO ACHIEVE ADEQUATE HIP DISTRACTION. LABRAL REPAIR, LABRAL RECONSTRUCTION, AND DECOMPRESSION OF FEMOROACETABULAR IMPINGEMENT SYNDROME HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED PROPERLY, RELIABLY, AND REPRODUCIBLY, AND NO TRENDELENBURG POSITION IS NEEDED. POSTLESS HIP ARTHROSCOPY IS MADE SIMPLE, AND POSITIONING THE PATIENT IS NOT DIFFICULT. HIP SURGEONS CAN ADAPT THIS TECHNIQUE TO A FRACTURE TABLE, A HIP DISTRACTOR, AND A STANDARD OPERATING ROOM TABLE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
2  733  18 EFFECT OF MULA BANDHA YOGA IN MILD GRADE PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE IS THE GROWING HEALTH ISSUE RELATED TO WOMEN OF THE REPRODUCTIVE AND POSTMENOPAUSAL AGE GROUP IN INDIA AND ACROSS THE GLOBE. TREATMENT OPTION FOR PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE INCLUDES BOTH SURGICAL AND NON-SURGICAL INTERVENTION. THE DEVELOPMENT OF PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE IS AN INDICATION FOR MAJOR SURGERY AMONG 20% OF ALL WOMEN. NEVERTHELESS, THE RECURRENCE OF PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE IS DETECTED AMONG 58% OF THE PATIENT AFTER SURGERY. THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR PREVENTIVE MEASURES FOR REDUCING THE IMPACT OF PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE. AIMS AND OBJECTIVE: TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF 3 MONTHS YOGA THERAPY IN FEMALE PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM MILD PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 50 PARTICIPANTS WERE ALLOCATED INTO TWO GROUPS (25 IN EACH GROUP) BY GENERATING RANDOM ALLOCATION SEQUENCE. WOMEN AGED 20-60 WITH SYMPTOMATIC MILD PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE IN THE YOGA GROUP WERE OFFERED MULABANDHA YOGA THERAPY ALONG WITH OTHER CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT MODALITIES, WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP WAS ONLY ON CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT. ALL PARTICIPANTS GAVE WRITTEN INFORMED CONSENT. AN ASSESSMENT WAS DONE BY IMPROVEMENT IN CHIEF COMPLAINTS AND PELVIC FLOOR DISTRESS INVENTORY-20 (PFDI-20) & PELVIC FLOOR IMPACT QUESTIONNAIRE-7 (PFIQ-7) AT BASELINE AND AT THE END OF 4, 8 & 12 WEEKS. RESULTS AT THE END OF 12 WEEKS, POST-STUDY COMPARISON BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN CHIEF COMPLAINTS LIKE PERENNIAL PAIN, P/V DISCHARGE, PERINEAL MUSCLE LAXITY AND FEELING OF SOMETHING COMING OUT P/V (P < 0.001). PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP IMPROVED BY (ON AVERAGE) 5.7 (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL 3.1 TO 14.7) POINTS MORE ON THE PFDI-20 THAN DID PARTICIPANTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP (P = 0.1) AND A MEAN SCORE OF PFIQ-7 WAS ALSO IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY. CONCLUSIONS: ALTHOUGH MULABANDHA (ROOT LOCK) YOGA THERAPY LED TO A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN PFDI-20 & PFIQ-7 SCORES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GROUPS WAS BELOW THE PRESUMED LEVEL OF CLINICAL RELEVANCE (15 POINTS). MORE STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO IDENTIFY FACTORS RELATED TO THE SUCCESS OF MULABANDHA (ROOT LOCK) YOGA THERAPY AND TO INVESTIGATE LONG-TERM EFFECTS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
3 1522  12 ISOLATED RUPTURE OF THE LATERAL COLLATERAL LIGAMENT DURING YOGA PRACTICE: A CASE REPORT. WE REPORT A CASE OF ISOLATED RUPTURE OF THE LATERAL COLLATERAL LIGAMENT (LCL) OF THE KNEE WHILE ATTEMPTING TO PLACE THE LEFT FOOT BEHIND THE HEAD DURING YOGA PRACTICE. THE 34-YEAR-OLD MAN HAD DISCOMFORT OF THE LATERAL ASPECT OF THE KNEE PARTICULARLY WITH VARUS STRAIN. A MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGE REVEALED RUPTURE OF THE LCL AT THE INSERTION ONTO THE FIBULA. THE PATIENT HAD GRADE-II LAXITY OF THE LCL AND WAS TREATED NON-OPERATIVELY. AT THE 12-MONTH FOLLOW-UP, GRADE-I LAXITY OF THE LCL REMAINED CLINICALLY EVIDENT, BUT FUNCTION WAS NOT IMPAIRED.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
4  352  18 ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECT OF MULABANDHA YOGA THERAPY IN HEALTHY WOMEN, STIGMATIZED FOR PELVIC FLOOR DYSFUNCTIONS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, WOMEN DO NOT REVEAL THEIR PERINEUM RELATED HEALTH ISSUES BECAUSE MOST OF THE TIME THEY ARE STIGMATIZED BY THE SOCIETY. MULTIPARITY, MOSTLY FOUND IN WOMEN OF RURAL AREAS IS ONE OF THE MAJOR CAUSES OF PELVIC FLOOR DYSFUNCTIONS (PFDS) LIKE PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE, URINARY INCONTINENCE, RECTAL INCONTINENCE, ETC. USUALLY, THEY VISIT HEALTH CENTRES IN THE ADVANCED STAGE OF DISEASES, AND THEN MEDICAL TREATMENT IS NOT THE ONLY CHOICE LEFT. MANY RESEARCH STUDIES SHOW THAT YOGA PRACTICES PROMOTE HEALTH CONDITIONS, CONTRIBUTE TO ENHANCING ENDURANCE, FLEXIBILITY, AND MUSCULAR STRENGTH, AND IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE. OBJECTIVE(S): THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF MULABANDHA YOGA THERAPY (MYT) IN HEALTHY WOMAN PARTICIPANTS AS A PREVENTIVE MEASURE. MATERIAL AND METHODS: THE STUDY WAS A PROSPECTIVE AND RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. FIFTY HEALTHY WOMAN PARTICIPANTS WERE ALLOCATED IN TWO GROUPS VIZ., MYT GROUP AND NO MYT GROUP. MULABANDHA YOGA WAS CONDUCTED FOR THE MYT GROUP FOR 12 WEEKS. NO MYT GROUP WAS ADVISED NOT TO DO YOGA. PELVIC FLOOR MUSCLE STRENGTH WAS INTERNALLY EVALUATED BY EMPLOYING THE PERFECT SCHEME SCORE (P = POWER, E = ENDURANCE, R = REPETITIONS, F = FAST CONTRACTIONS, ECT = EVERY CONTRACTION TIMED). FOR ELIGIBLE SAMPLES, MYT SESSIONS WERE HELD FOR 12 WEEKS. DATA INTERPRETATION WAS DONE WITH SPSS SOFTWARE 20.0 (IBM CORP. RELEASED 2011. IBM SPSS STATISTICS FOR WINDOWS, VERSION 20.0. ARMONK, NY, USA). RESULTS: FIFTY HEALTHY WOMAN PARTICIPANTS WERE ALLOCATED FOR ANALYSIS. THERE WAS NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN BETWEEN THE GROUPS COMPARISON IN TERMS OF AGE, SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS, OCCUPATION, EDUCATION, PARITY AND MODE OF DELIVERY. PERFECT SCHEME SCORE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED IN PARTICIPANTS AFTER 12 WEEKS OF REGULAR MYT. NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED BETWEEN THE GROUPS COMPARISON IN TERMS OF PERFECT SCHEME SCORE. CONCLUSION: THE CURRENT STUDY SHOWS THAT REGULAR PRACTICE OF MYT FOR 12 WEEKS IS A BETTER MEANS TO REINFORCE THE STRENGTH OF PELVIC FLOOR MUSCLES IN WOMEN. THIS MYT PROCEDURE WILL ESTABLISH EVIDENCE FOR WOMEN WHO ARE RELUCTANT TOWARDS THEIR PELVIC ORGAN-RELATED ISSUES. WOMEN MUST INCORPORATE THE MYT PRACTICE IN THEIR ROUTINE LIFE AS A PREVENTIVE MEASURE TO REFRAIN FROM PELVIC FLOOR DYSFUNCTIONS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
5  197  15 A RARE CASE OF QUADRATUS FEMORIS MUSCLE RUPTURE AFTER YOGA EXERCISES. WE PRESENT A CASE OF A FEMALE PATIENT WITH LEFT GROIN PAIN AFTER INTENSE YOGA EXERCISES. THE PATIENT PRESENTED ABNORMAL PATTERN OF GAIT WITH NO SWELLING OVER THE GROIN, THIGH, OR BUTTOCK. MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING DEMONSTRATED A TEAR OF THE QUADRATUS FEMORIS MUSCLE WITH AN ASSOCIATED EXTENSIVE HEMATOMA FORMATION. PATIENT WAS TREATED WITH A REHABILITATION PROGRAM CONSISTING OF NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS AND PHYSIOTHERAPY. AT THE FOLLOW-UP CONTROL, THE PATIENT HAD IMPROVED HER PAIN AND FLEXIBILITY OF THE HIP, AND GRADUALLY SHE RETURNED TO DAILY ACTIVITIES AND YOGA EXERCISES. SUCH AN ENTITY IS A RARE CAUSE OF HIP PAIN AFTER EXERCISE AND SHOULD BE KEPT IN MIND BY THE ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON, IN CASES OF GLUTEAL PAIN AFTER INTENSE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. MOREOVER, SUCH A CONDITION SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE DIAGNOSTIC ALGORITHM OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN HIP PAIN.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
6 1327  24 HIGH RATE OF RETURN TO YOGA FOR ATHLETES AFTER HIP ARTHROSCOPY FOR FEMOROACETABULAR IMPINGEMENT SYNDROME. BACKGROUND: FEMOROACETABULAR IMPINGEMENT SYNDROME (FAIS) IS MOST COMMONLY DIAGNOSED IN PATIENTS WHO PERFORM ACTIVITIES THAT REQUIRE REPETITIVE HIP FLEXION AND ROTATIONAL LOADING. YOGA IS AN ACTIVITY GROWING IN POPULARITY THAT INVOLVES THESE MOTIONS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE PATIENTS' ABILITY TO RETURN TO YOGA AFTER HIP ARTHROSCOPY FOR FAIS. HYPOTHESIS: THERE WOULD BE A HIGH RATE OF RETURN TO YOGA AFTER HIP ARTHROSCOPY. STUDY DESIGN: RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: LEVEL 4. METHODS: CONSECUTIVE PATIENTS WITH FAIS WHO HAD IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS PARTICIPATING IN YOGA AND HAD UNDERGONE HIP ARTHROSCOPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF FAIS BETWEEN 2012 AND 2015 WERE REVIEWED. DEMOGRAPHIC DATA WERE COLLECTED AND ASSESSED FOR ALL PATIENTS, AS WELL AS PREOPERATIVE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION, IMAGING, AND PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOME (PRO) SCORES, INCLUDING THE MODIFIED HARRIS HIP SCORE (MHHS), HIP OUTCOME SCORE ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING (HOS-ADL) AND SPORTS-SPECIFIC (HOS-SS) SUBSCALES, AND VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS) FOR PAIN. POSTOPERATIVELY, EXAMINATION AND PRO DATA WERE COLLECTED AT A MINIMUM 1 YEAR AFTER SURGERY, INCLUDING A YOGA-SPECIFIC QUESTIONNAIRE. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 42 PATIENTS (90% FEMALE; MEAN AGE, 35 +/- 9 YEARS; MEAN BODY MASS INDEX, 23.1 +/- 3.2 KG/M(2)) WERE INCLUDED. THIRTY PATIENTS (71%) HAD TO DISCONTINUE THEIR YOGA ROUTINE PREOPERATIVELY BECAUSE OF HIP-RELATED SYMPTOMS AT A MEAN 9.5 +/- 8.2 MONTHS BEFORE SURGERY. AFTER SURGERY, 39 PATIENTS (93%) WERE ABLE TO RETURN TO YOGA AT A MEAN 5.3 +/- 2.2 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY. TWO OF THE 3 PATIENTS WHO DID NOT RETURN TO YOGA NOTED LOSS OF INTEREST AS THEIR REASON FOR STOPPING, WHILE 1 PATIENT WAS UNABLE TO RETURN BECAUSE OF PERSISTENT HIP PAIN. NINETEEN PATIENTS (45%) RETURNED TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF YOGA PRACTICE, 17 PATIENTS (40%) RETURNED TO THE SAME LEVEL, AND 3 PATIENTS (7%) RETURNED TO A LOWER LEVEL. THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN THE NUMBER OF HOURS SPENT PRACTICING YOGA PER WEEK PRE- AND POSTOPERATIVELY (2.7 +/- 1.9 VS 2.5 +/- 1.3 HOURS; P = 0.44). ALL PATIENTS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ALL PROS AS WELL AS PAIN SCORES AFTER SURGERY (HOS-ADL, 67.4 +/- 18.3 TO 93.1 +/- 6.9 [ P < 0.001]; HOS-SS, 45.6 +/- 24.7 TO 81.5 +/- 18.8 [ P < 0.001]; MHHS, 62.3 +/- 11.3 TO 86.8 +/- 12.3 [ P < 0.0001]; VAS PAIN, 6.3 +/- 2.2 TO 0.90 +/- 1.1 [ P < 0.001]). CONCLUSION: PATIENTS PARTICIPATING IN YOGA RETURN TO YOGA 93% OF THE TIME AND AT A MEAN 5.3 +/- 2.2 MONTHS AFTER HIP ARTHROSCOPY FOR FAIS. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: INFORMATION REGARDING SURGICAL OUTCOMES IS CRITICAL IN COUNSELING PATIENTS, PARTICULARLY FEMALE ATHLETES, ON THEIR EXPECTATIONS WITH RESPECT TO RETURNING TO YOGA AFTER HIP ARTHROSCOPY FOR FAIS.	2018

A 63-YEAR-OLD OVERWEIGHT FEMALE PREDIAGNOSED OF STRESS URINARY INCONTINENCE PRESENTED WITH EXACERBATED EVENTS OF URINE LEAKAGE. SHE WAS ADVISED A RESIDENTIAL LIFESTYLE AND BEHAVIORAL PROGRAM, PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF A MONITORED YOGA THERAPY MODULE, APART FROM HER ONGOING ANTICHOLINERGIC MEDICINE, FOR 21 DAYS. ASSESSMENTS WERE BASED ON A FREQUENCY VOLUME CHART, A BLADDER DIARY FOR THE ENTIRE DURATION OF TREATMENT, AND THE INTERNATIONAL CONSULTATION ON INCONTINENCE MODULAR QUESTIONNAIRE-URINARY INCONTINENCE SHORT FORM QUESTIONNAIRE ON THE DAYS OF ADMISSION AND DISCHARGE. A TOTAL OF 1.9 KG OF WEIGHT LOSS WAS OBSERVED DURING HER STAY. USAGE OF PAD, AS REPORTED IN HER DIARY, REDUCED FROM 3 TO 1 PER DAY. HER INTERNATIONAL CONSULTATION ON INCONTINENCE MODULAR QUESTIONNAIRE-URINARY INCONTINENCE SHORT FORM SCORE REDUCED FROM 16 TO 9, INDICATING BETTER CONTINENCE. SHE EXPRESSED SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING AND CONFIDENCE IN HER SOCIAL INTERACTIONS. THIS IS PROBABLY THE FIRST CASE REPORT DEMONSTRATING FEASIBILITY OF INTEGRATION OF YOGA THERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF URINARY INCONTINENCE.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
8   99  22 A PATIENT WITH ELECTROCONVULSIVE THERAPY-RESISTANT MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER WITH A FULL RESPONSE TO HEATED YOGA: A CASE REPORT. DEPRESSION REMAINS DIFFICULT TO TREAT AS A RESULT OF LESS THAN OPTIMAL EFFICACY AND TROUBLESOME SIDE EFFECTS OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS. THE AUTHORS PRESENT THE CASE OF A PATIENT WITH TREATMENT-RESISTANT DEPRESSION WITH MELANCHOLIC FEATURES WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN UNRESPONSIVE TO ELECTROCONVULSIVE THERAPY (ECT) PLUS AN ANTIDEPRESSANT REGIMEN BUT WHOSE CONDITION FULLY REMITTED WITH THE ADDITION OF A STANDARDIZED FORM OF HEATED HATHA YOGA (HY; BIKRAM YOGA) PRACTICED IN A ROOM HEATED TO 105 DEGREES F. THE PATIENT WAS A 28-YEAR-OLD WOMAN WHO UNDERWENT 8 WEEKS OF HY AS PART OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF HY FOR DEPRESSION WHILE CONTINUING HER ANTIDEPRESSANT TREATMENT. THE PATIENT WAS ASKED TO ATTEND A MINIMUM OF 2 WEEKLY, 90-MINUTE HY CLASSES. AFTER 8 WEEKS (12 CLASSES IN TOTAL), THE PATIENT NO LONGER MET THE CRITERIA FOR A MAJOR DEPRESSIVE EPISODE WITH MELANCHOLIC FEATURES, PER MINI-INTERNATIONAL NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INTERVIEW (MINI) CRITERIA. HER DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS HAD IMPROVED DRAMATICALLY, WITH INVENTORY OF DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMATOLOGY, CLINICIAN-RATED (IDS-C30), AND HAMILTON DEPRESSION RATING SCALE (HAM-D28) SCORES DECREASING FROM 28 AT BASELINE TO 3, AND FROM 28 AT BASELINE TO 4, RESPECTIVELY, INDICATING REMISSION. THIS PATIENT'S ECT-RESISTANT DEPRESSION REMITTED WITH THE ADDITION OF HY TO HER ANTIDEPRESSANT REGIMEN. BECAUSE OF HER YOUTH AND ATHLETICISM, THIS PATIENT WAS LIKELY WELL SUITED TO THIS RIGOROUS FORM OF YOGA. FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO EXPLORE HY AS A POTENTIAL INTERVENTION FOR TREATMENT-RESISTANT DEPRESSION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
9  140  16 A PROSPECTIVE STUDY ON TYPE-2 DIABETIC COMPLICATIONS AND EFFICACY OF INTEGRATED YOGA: A PAN INDIA 2017. BACKGROUND: TYPE 2 DIABETES (T2DM) CONTRIBUTES TO HIGH MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY BECAUSE OF ITS MAJOR COMPLICATIONS RELATED TO KIDNEY, HEART, BRAIN, AND EYES. IT ALSO POSES A HIGH RISK FOR MORTALITY BECAUSE OF COVID-19. STUDIES SUGGEST THE POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS OF YOGA IN DELAYING OR ATTENUATING SUCH COMPLICATIONS. METHODOLOGY: THIS WAS A PAN-INDIA MULTI CENTERED CLUSTER-RANDOMIZED (4 LEVEL) TWO-ARMED TRIAL IN THE RURAL AND URBAN POPULATION OF ALL POPULOUS STATES OF INDIA. DATA WERE OBTAINED USING MOBILE APP IN ALL ADULTS IN THE HOUSEHOLD OF THE SELECTED CLUSTERS. RESULTS: WE REPORT THE DIABETES RELATED COMPLICATIONS IN 16623 ADULTS (48% MALES, 52% FEMALES) FROM 65 DISTRICTS (1 IN 10 DISTRICTS, 2011 CENSUS) OF 29 (OUT OF 35) STATES AND UNION TERRITORIES OF INDIA; MEAN AGE WAS 48.2 +/- 12.46 YEARS. OUT OF THIS 40% LIVED IN RURAL AND 62% IN URBAN LOCATIONS. IN HIGH RISK DIABETES INDIVIDUALS (SCORED >/= 60 POINTS ON INDIAN DIABETES RISK SCORE KEY), 18.0% HAD SELF-REPORTED HISTORY OF (PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY, 6.1% HAD H/O MAJOR STROKES, 5.5% HAD MINOR STROKES (TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC EPISODES), 18.1% HAD LOWER LIMB CLAUDICATION, 20.5% LEG ULCERS, 4.4% HAD H/O CARDIAC SURGERY, 4.8% ANGIOPLASTY, AND 15.1% HAD DIABETES RETINOPATHY. COMPLICATIONS WERE HIGHER IN RURAL THAN IN URBAN AREAS, HIGHER IN PEOPLE WITH EXTENDED DURATION OF DIABETES. INTEGRATED YOGA MODULE FOR THREE MONTHS (ONE HOUR DAILY) SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER REDUCTION IN SYMPTOMS RELATED TO COMPLICATIONS AS COMPARED TO CONTROL GROUP (P < .001). CONCLUSION: THE ALARMING HIGH PREVALENCE OF COMPLICATIONS IN DIABETES POPULATION CALLS FOR URGENT ACTION, WHERE YOGA MAY SHOW THE BENEFITS IN REDUCTION OF SYMPTOMS OF COMPLICATIONS.	2021

POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME (PCOS) AFFECTS 8-13% OF REPRODUCTIVE-AGED WOMEN. PCOS IS CHARACTERISED BY MENSTRUAL IRREGULARITY, HYPERANDROGENISM AND POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN MORPHOLOGY (PCOM). THE EFFICACY OF YOGA AS A THERAPY TO TACKLE THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT CAUSE OF AILMENT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PCOS IS TO BE DOCUMENTED. THIS IS THE CASE STUDY OF A FEMALE PATIENT AGE 25 YEARS, A DIAGNOSED CASE OF PCOS WAS REGISTERED AT THE AYURVEDA, YOGA, UNANI,SIDDHA,HOMEOPATHY (AYUSH), YOGA OPD, WITH COMPLAINTS OF IRREGULAR MENSTRUATION, TREATED SUCCESSFULLY BY YOGA AND NATUROPATHY (Y AND N), I.E., YOGA, DIET AND LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION. THIS IS EVIDENT FROM THE REDUCTION IN WEIGHT, REGULARISATION OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE ALONG WITH MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE OVARY AFTER A FOLLOW-UP OF 6 MONTHS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
11 2211  16 THE HEALTH IMAGINARY OF POSTURAL YOGA. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE CAPACITY OF YOGA NARRATIVES AND PRACTICES TO CONTRIBUTE TO AND RELATE IDEAS ABOUT HEALTH. IT ADDS THEORETICALLY TO EXISTING LITERATURE ON YOGA BY INTRODUCING THE CONCEPT OF THE 'HEALTH IMAGINARY' AS AN ANALYTIC LENS FOR CONSIDERING YOGA DISCOURSES IN LATE MODERN TIMES, WHERE PERSONAL HEALTH CARE AND SPIRITUAL AMBITIONS ARE ONCE AGAIN BECOMING BLURRED. WITH THIS PERSPECTIVE, THE PAPER PROVIDES A THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF HOW YOGA POSTURES (ASANAS) ARE CONCEIVED TO WORK THERAPEUTICALLY, IN YOGA'S RECENT HISTORY AND IN PRESENT-DAY YOGA THERAPY. TAKING CASE STUDIES FROM INDIA AND GERMANY, IT IS SHOWN EMPIRICALLY HOW THE APPLICATION OF ASANAS IS RATIONALIZED DIFFERENTLY IN SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHICAL AND THERAPEUTIC ENVIRONMENTS - PARTICULARLY REGARDING THE PRESUMED THEORY OF THE BODY. THUS, THE CONCEPT OF THE HEALTH IMAGINARY NOT ONLY PROVIDES ANALYTIC SPACE TO EXPLORE THE IMPLICIT LOGICS AND GOALS OF HEALING IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS, BUT ALSO OFFERS CLUES ABOUT THE DISTINCT SOCIAL, CULTURAL/RELIGIOUS, AND LOCAL INFLUENCES THAT DRAW PEOPLE INTO YOGA AND CONTRIBUTE TO ITS SELECTIVE APPROPRIATION ACROSS THE GLOBE.	2021

13 1911  16 ROLE OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE IN THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC - A NARRATIVE REVIEW. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS POSED AN IMMENSE CHALLENGE TO HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AROUND THE GLOBE IN TERMS OF LIMITED HEALTH CARE FACILITIES AND PROVEN MEDICAL THERAPEUTICS TO ADDRESS THE SYMPTOMS OF THE INFECTION. THE CURRENT HEALTH CARE STRATEGIES ARE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON EITHER THE PATHOGEN OR THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. HOWEVER, EFFORTS TOWARDS STRENGTHENING THE HOST IMMUNITY ARE IMPORTANT FROM PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF INFECTION AND DOWNREGULATE THE POTENCY OF THE INFECTIOUS AGENT. WHILE A VACCINE CAN INDUCE SPECIFIC IMMUNITY IN THE HOST, NON-SPECIFIC WAYS OF IMPROVING OVERALL HOST IMMUNITY ARE NEEDED AS WELL. THIS SCENARIO HAS PAVED THE WAY FOR THE USE OF TRADITIONAL INDIAN THERAPIES SUCH AS AYURVEDA AND YOGA. THIS REVIEW AIMS AT COLLATING AVAILABLE EVIDENCE ON AYURVEDA, YOGA, AND COVID-19. FURTHER, IT DRAWS INFERENCES FROM RECENT STUDIES ON YOGA AND AYURVEDA ON IMMUNITY, RESPIRATORY HEALTH, AND MENTAL HEALTH RESPECTIVELY TO APPROXIMATE ITS PROBABLE ROLE IN PROPHYLAXIS AND AS AN ADD-ON MANAGEMENT OPTION FOR THE CURRENT PANDEMIC.	2022

SHE STATED THAT YOGA HELPED HER TO FIND ACCESS TO HER BODY AND ITS NEEDS AND TO COPE WITH HER TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES. SHE ALSO REPORTED THAT ATTITUDES HAVE CHANGED IN RELATION TO HER STOMACH IN THE TREATMENT OF HER ANOREXIA. THE CASE REPORT CONFIRMED THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF YOGA ON EATING DISORDERS. RESEARCH SHOULD PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE INFLUENCE OF INDIVIDUAL'S CO-MORBIDITIES, AS EATING DISORDERS USUALLY OCCUR IN ASSOCIATION WITH CO-MORBIDITIES.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
15 2880  15 YOGA: A BIOBEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO REDUCE SYMPTOM DISTRESS IN WOMEN WITH URGE URINARY INCONTINENCE. URGE URINARY INCONTINENCE IS A DEBILITATING CHRONIC CONDITION THAT POSES CHALLENGES FOR AFFECTED WOMEN AND THE CLINICIANS WHO CARE FOR THEM. MULTICOMPONENT BEHAVIORAL THERAPIES HAVE SHOWN PROMISE IN ALLOWING WOMEN TO MANAGE THEIR SYMPTOMS. NEW EVIDENCE SUGGESTS AN UNDERLYING PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC INFLAMMATORY PROCESS FOR URGE URINARY INCONTINENCE, AND COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES THAT ADDRESS THE PSYCHONEUROIMMUNOLOGY COMPONENT MAY IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THE MILLIONS OF WOMEN WITH THIS CONDITION. YOGA, A MIND-BODY THERAPY, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE INFLAMMATION AND MAY HELP IMPROVE SYMPTOMS OF URGE URINARY INCONTINENCE. MORE RESEARCH IS NECESSARY TO DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA TO REDUCE URGE URINARY INCONTINENCE SYMPTOM BURDEN AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
16 1991  22 SPINE FUSIONS, YOGA INSTRUCTORS, AND HIP FRACTURES: THE ROLE OF DUAL MOBILITY IN PRIMARY TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY. BACKGROUND: DESPITE THE INCREASED USE OF DUAL MOBILITY (DM) IN PRIMARY TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY (THA), DEBATE EXISTS REGARDING THE INDICATIONS FOR ITS USE. NO SPECIFIC ALGORITHM EXISTS TO GUIDE THIS DECISION-MAKING PROCESS. THEREFORE, THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO SUMMARIZE THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE LITERATURE REGARDING THE USE OF DM IN PRIMARY THA AND PROVIDE EVIDENCE-BASED GUIDELINES BASED ON SPECIFIC PATIENT POPULATIONS AND RISK FACTORS FOR INSTABILITY. METHODS: WE REVIEWED THE CURRENT LITERATURE FOR STUDIES EVALUATING RISK FACTORS FOR DISLOCATION IN PRIMARY THA, AS WELL AS THE CLINICAL USE AND RESULTS OF DM IN PRIMARY THA. BASED ON THE STRENGTH OF THE LITERATURE, WE DISCUSS THE USE OF DM IN SPECIFIC PATIENT POPULATIONS. WE PROVIDE A DECISION-MAKING ALGORITHM TO DETERMINE WHETHER A PATIENT MAY BE INDICATED FOR DM IN PRIMARY THA. RESULTS: SURGEONS SHOULD CONSIDER PREOPERATIVE PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS, RISK FACTORS FOR INSTABILITY (EG, SIGNIFICANT HIP-SPINE ISSUES), TYPE OF PROCEDURE TO BE PERFORMED (EG, CONVERSION ARTHROPLASTY), AND INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY (EG, THA FOR FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE). BASED ON THIS ALGORITHMIC ASSESSMENT, DM MAY BE WARRANTED IN THE PRIMARY THA SETTING IF A PATIENT'S COMBINED RISK REACHES AN ESTABLISHED THRESHOLD BASED ON THE LITERATURE. CONCLUSION: THIS EVIDENCE-BASED ALGORITHM MAY HELP GUIDE CURRENT PRACTICE IN THE USE OF DM IN PRIMARY THA. WE ADVOCATE THE CONTINUED JUDICIOUS USE OF DM IN HIP ARTHROPLASTY. LONGER TERM STUDIES ARE NEEDED IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE DURABILITY OF DM, AS WELL AS ANY COMPLICATIONS RELATED TO THE DM ARTICULATION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
17   74  18 A GROUP-BASED YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION FOR URINARY INCONTINENCE IN WOMEN: A PILOT RANDOMIZED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY, EFFICACY, AND SAFETY OF A GROUP-BASED YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION FOR MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER WOMEN WITH URINARY INCONTINENCE. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A PILOT RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF AMBULATORY WOMEN AGED 40 YEARS AND OLDER WITH STRESS, URGENCY, OR MIXED-TYPE INCONTINENCE. WOMEN WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 6-WEEK YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM (N = 10) CONSISTING OF TWICE WEEKLY GROUP CLASSES AND ONCE WEEKLY HOME PRACTICE OR A WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 9). ALL PARTICIPANTS ALSO RECEIVED WRITTEN PAMPHLETS ABOUT STANDARD BEHAVIORAL SELF-MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES FOR INCONTINENCE. CHANGES IN INCONTINENCE WERE ASSESSED WITH 7-DAY VOIDING DIARIES. RESULTS: THE MEAN (SD) AGE WAS 61.4 (8.2) YEARS, AND THE MEAN BASELINE FREQUENCY OF INCONTINENCE WAS 2.5 (1.3) EPISODES/D. AFTER 6 WEEKS, THE TOTAL INCONTINENCE FREQUENCY DECREASED BY 70% (1.8 [0.9] FEWER EPISODES/D) IN THE YOGA THERAPY VERSUS 13% (0.3 [1.7] FEWER EPISODES/D) IN THE CONTROL GROUP (P = 0.049). PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA THERAPY GROUP ALSO REPORTED AN AVERAGE OF 71% DECREASE IN STRESS INCONTINENCE FREQUENCY (0.7 [0.8] FEWER EPISODES/D) COMPARED WITH A 25% INCREASE IN CONTROLS (0.2 [1.1] MORE EPISODES/D) (P = 0.039). NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN REDUCTION IN URGENCY INCONTINENCE WERE DETECTED BETWEEN THE YOGA THERAPY VERSUS CONTROL GROUPS (1.0 [1.0] VERSUS 0.5 [0.5] FEWER EPISODES/D; P = 0.20). ALL WOMEN STARTING THE YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM COMPLETED AT LEAST 90% OF THE GROUP CLASSES AND PRACTICE SESSIONS. TWO PARTICIPANTS IN EACH GROUP REPORTED ADVERSE EVENTS UNRELATED TO THE INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS PROVIDE PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE FEASIBILITY, EFFICACY, AND SAFETY OF A GROUP-BASED YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE URINARY INCONTINENCE IN WOMEN.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
18 1546  18 LATE ANTERIOR PROSTHETIC HIP DISLOCATION DUE TO YOGA. THE POPULARITY OF YOGA AND THE PREVALENCE OF TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY (THA) HAVE SIMULTANEOUSLY INCREASED IN THE UNITED STATES. ACCORDINGLY, ONE CAN ASSUME THAT THE NUMBER OF THA PATIENTS PRACTICING YOGA HAS INCREASED. CERTAIN YOGA POSES REACH THE EXTREMES OF HIP RANGE OF MOTION, POTENTIALLY LEAVING PATIENTS VULNERABLE TO DISLOCATION. TO DATE, 2 CASES OF LATE POSTERIOR PROSTHETIC HIP DISLOCATIONS DURING YOGA HAVE BEEN REPORTED; HOWEVER, THERE HAVE BEEN NO REPORTS OF ANTERIOR PROSTHETIC HIP DISLOCATIONS. WE PRESENT ONE CASE OF LATE ANTERIOR PROSTHETIC HIP DISLOCATION DURING YOGA IN A PATIENT WHO UNDERWENT THA VIA THE DIRECT ANTERIOR APPROACH. PROSTHETIC HIP DISLOCATION DURING YOGA MAY BE A GROWING CONCERN.

19 1532  17 IYENGAR YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION FOR ISCHIAL PRESSURE ULCERS IN A PATIENT WITH AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS: A CASE STUDY. BACKGROUND: ALTHOUGH SOME RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THE FORMATION OF PRESSURE ULCERS IS RARE IN PATIENTS WITH AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS (ALS), SEVERAL PATIENTS HAVE NONETHELESS DEVELOPED THIS PROBLEM. TO DATE, HOWEVER, NO CASE REPORTS IN THE LITERATURE HAVE DESCRIBED PATIENTS WITH ALS WHO DEVELOP ISCHIAL PRESSURE ULCERS. OUTSIDE OF THE ALS LITERATURE, EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT ISCHIAL PRESSURE ULCERS FREQUENTLY DEVELOP IN WHEELCHAIR USERS AND ALSO IN PATIENTS TREATED IN VARIOUS HEALTH CARE SETTINGS. CASE DESCRIPTION: A PATIENT DIAGNOSED WITH ALS REPORTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF ISCHIAL PRESSURE ULCERS AFTER CONSISTENT IMMOBILITY FOR 1 YEAR (32 MONTHS AFTER HER ALS DIAGNOSIS). THIS PATIENT, WHO WAS SITTING ON THE WOUNDS, WAS TREATED WITH OINTMENT AND MORPHINE; THE LATTER WAS INEFFECTIVE IN CONTROLLING THE PAIN. MOVING THE PATIENT FROM SITTING TO SUPINE, LATERAL, OR SEMILATERAL POSITIONS, EITHER ON THE BED OR WHEELCHAIR, TO SEPARATE THE ULCERS FROM THE SURFACE OF THE CHAIR OR BED WAS DEEMED IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE OF EXAGGERATION OF OTHER SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND PAIN IN OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY. A NEW METHOD OF POSTURAL ALIGNMENT WAS DEVELOPED TO ALLEVIATE THE PAIN ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRESSURE ULCER. THIS METHOD, IYENGAR YOGA THERAPY, WHICH USES PROPS TO REPOSITION A PATIENT, ALLEVIATED PAIN AND HEALING OF TWO PRESSURE ULCERS OF THE PATIENT AFTER 3 WEEKS OF STARTING THIS INTERVENTION. CONCLUSION: ALTHOUGH THE ISCHIAL PRESSURE ULCERS WERE SUCCESSFULLY TREATED IN A PATIENT WITH ALS, FURTHER STUDY IS NECESSARY TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS POSTURAL ALIGNMENT INTERVENTION IN ALS AND OTHER PATIENT POPULATIONS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF ISCHIAL PRESSURE ULCERS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
20  795  16 EFFECT OF YOGA INTERVENTION IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION: A PREVENTIVE TRIAL. BACKGROUND: NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES ARE ON THE RISE IN INDIA. HYPERTENSION IS ONE OF THE MAJOR RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES AND ALSO LABELED AS A CHRONIC LIFESTYLE DISORDER. HENCE, NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS LEADING TO LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS ARE OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO CONTROL AND PREVENT HYPERTENSION. THIS TRIAL AIMS TO IMPLEMENT YOGA INTERVENTION TO THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP IN ADDITION TO MEDICINES, ADVICE ON DIET AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND TO COMPARE BLOOD PRESSURE AND PERCEIVED STRESS SCORES WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. METHODS: IT WAS AN OPEN-LABEL, TWO-ARMED, NON-RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, CONDUCTED AT A TERTIARY CARE CENTER ON 145 PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION: 73 IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP AND 72 IN THE CONTROL GROUP. THE INTERVENTION GROUP RECEIVED YOGA INTERVENTION FOR A PERIOD OF 4 MONTHS ON A WEEKLY BASIS ALONG WITH ADVICE ON PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, DIET, AND ROUTINE MEDICINES. THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT RECEIVE YOGA INTERVENTION. RESULTS: THE MEAN AGE OF THE PARTICIPANTS WAS 51.3 +/- 9.4, FEMALES (58.2%) OUTNUMBERED MALES (41.3%). FOLLOWING THE INTERVENTION, PERCEIVED STRESS SCORE AND BLOOD PRESSURE SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION BETWEEN TWO GROUPS (P < 0.001). ALSO, PERCEIVED STRESS AND BLOOD PRESSURE WERE FOUND TO BE REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY WITHIN BOTH GROUPS (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: YOGA PROVES TO BE AN EFFECTIVE, SAFE, AND LESS EXPENSIVE ADJUNCT THERAPY FOR HYPERTENSION MANAGEMENT. YOGA WAS ALSO FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE LEVEL OF STRESS. DIET MODIFICATION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY HAVE GOT AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN THE CONTROL AND PREVENTION OF HYPERTENSION.	2021

1 1385 144 IMPACT OF RELAXATION TRAINING ACCORDING TO YOGA IN DAILY LIFE(R) SYSTEM ON SELF-ESTEEM AFTER BREAST CANCER SURGERY. OBJECTIVES: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO GATHER INFORMATION ON THE IMMEDIATE AND SHORT-TERM EFFECTS OF RELAXATION TRAINING ACCORDING TO THE YOGA IN DAILY LIFE((R)) SYSTEM ON THE SELF-ESTEEM OF PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. DESIGN: THIS IS A PARALLEL-GROUPS DESIGN. SETTINGS/LOCATION: BASELINE INTERVENTIONS TOOK PLACE AT THE INSTITUTE FOR ONCOLOGY OF LJUBLJANA (SLOVENIA). AT DISCHARGE, THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS ISSUED WITH AUDIOCASSETTE RECORDINGS CONTAINING THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR RELAXATION TRAINING TO BE PRACTICED INDIVIDUALLY AT HOME FOR AN ADDITIONAL 3 WEEKS. SUBJECTS: THE CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF 32 PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER WAS RECRUITED FROM AN ACCESSIBLE POPULATION OF HOSPITALIZED WOMEN. PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO THE EXPERIMENTAL (N=16) AND TO THE CONTROL GROUP (N=16). INTERVENTIONS: BOTH GROUPS RECEIVED THE SAME STANDARD PHYSIOTHERAPY FOR 1 WEEK, WHILE THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP ADDITIONALLY RECEIVED A GROUP RELAXATION TRAINING SESSIONS ACCORDING TO THE YOGA IN DAILY LIFE((R)) SYSTEM. AT DISCHARGE, THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS ISSUED WITH AUDIOCASSETTE RECORDINGS CONTAINING SIMILAR INSTRUCTIONS FOR RELAXATION TRAINING TO BE PRACTICED INDIVIDUALLY AT HOME FOR AN ADDITIONAL 3 WEEKS. OUTCOME MEASURES: OUTCOME MEASURES WERE OBTAINED BY BLINDED INVESTIGATORS (PHYSIOTHERAPISTS) USING STANDARDIZED QUESTIONNAIRES (ROSENBERG SELF-ESTEEM SCALE) AT BASELINE (AFTER THE SURGERY); AT 1 WEEK (1 WEEK POSTATTENDANCE; AT DISCHARGE); AND AT 4 WEEKS (4 WEEKS POSTATTENDANCE); PRIOR THE COMMENCEMENT OF RADIATION. RESULTS: ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE SHOWED THAT THERE WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUP IN ALL MEASURING SELF-ESTEEM SCORES OVER THE STUDY PERIOD (P<0.0005). AT THE SAME TIME, THE CONTROL GROUP'S SCORES REMAINED UNCHANGED OVER THE STUDY PERIOD (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT RELAXATION TRAINING ACCORDING TO THE YOGA IN DAILY LIFE SYSTEM COULD BE A USEFUL CLINICAL PHYSIOTHERAPY INTERVENTION FOR PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST CANCER AND WHO ARE EXPERIENCING LOW SELF-ESTEEM. ALTHOUGH THIS KIND OF RELAXATION TRAINING CAN BE APPLIED TO CLINICAL ONCOLOGY IN SLOVENIA, MORE STUDIES NEED TO BE DONE.	2011	

2 1384 104 IMPACT OF RELAXATION TRAINING ACCORDING TO YOGA IN DAILY LIFE(R) SYSTEM ON PERCEIVED STRESS AFTER BREAST CANCER SURGERY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO GATHER INFORMATION ON THE IMMEDIATE AND SHORT-TERM EFFECTS OF RELAXATION TRAINING ACCORDING TO YOGA IN DAILY LIFE((R)) (YIDL) SYSTEM ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. 32 PATIENTS AT THE INSTITUTE FOR ONCOLOGY OF LJUBLJANA WERE RANDOMIZED TO THE EXPERIMENTAL (N=16) AND TO THE CONTROL GROUP (N=16). BOTH GROUPS RECEIVED THE SAME STANDARD PHYSIOTHERAPY FOR 1 WEEK, WHILE THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP ADDITIONALLY RECEIVED A GROUP RELAXATION TRAINING SESSIONS ACCORDING TO YIDL((R)) SYSTEM. AT DISCHARGE THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS ISSUED WITH AUDIOCASSETTE RECORDINGS CONTAINING THE SIMILAR INSTRUCTIONS FOR RELAXATION TRAINING TO BE PRACTICED INDIVIDUALLY AT HOME (FOR FURTHER 3 WEEKS). AN EXPERIMENTAL REPEATED MEASURES DESIGN WAS USED TO INVESTIGATE THE DIFFERENCES OVER 1 MONTH PERIOD IN STRESS LEVELS, CHANGES IN MENTAL HEALTH AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS. MEASURES WERE OBTAINED AT THREE TIME POINTS DURING THE STUDY PERIOD: BASELINE, AT 1 WEEK, AND AT 4 WEEKS, BY BLINDED INVESTIGATORS USING STANDARDIZED QUESTIONNAIRES GENERAL HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE-12 (GHQ-12), ROTTERDAM SYMPTOM CHECKLIST (RSCL) PSYCHOLOGICAL SUBSCALE, PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE (PSS). PATIENTS WHO RECEIVED RELAXATION TRAINING REPORTED FEELING SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DISTRESSED DURING HOSPITALIZATION AND AFTER DISCHARGE-PERIOD THAN DID THE CONTROLS THAT DID NOT RECEIVE RELAXATION TRAINING. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT RELAXATION TRAINING ACCORDING TO YOGA IN DAILY LIFE((R)) SYSTEM COULD BE USEFUL CLINICAL PHYSIOTHERAPY INTERVENTION FOR BREAST CANCER PATIENTS EXPERIENCING PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. ALTHOUGH THIS KIND OF RELAXATION TRAINING CAN BE APPLIED TO CLINICAL ONCOLOGY IN SLOVENIA, MORE STUDIES NEED TO BE DONE.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
3 1383  80 IMPACT OF RELAXATION TRAINING ACCORDING TO THE YOGA IN DAILY LIFE(R) SYSTEM ON ANXIETY AFTER BREAST CANCER SURGERY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO GATHER INFORMATION ON THE IMMEDIATE AND SHORT-TERM EFFECTS OF RELAXATION TRAINING ACCORDING TO THE YOGA IN DAILY LIFE(R) (YIDL(R)) SYSTEM ON ANXIETY OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. THE YIDL(R) SYSTEM IS A HOLISTIC SYSTEM BEING PRACTISED AND TAUGHT WORLDWIDE AND HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF VARIOUS DISEASES. THE SYSTEM AIMS TO ESTABLISH PHYSICAL, MENTAL, SPIRITUAL, AND SOCIAL HEALTH. THIRTY-TWO PATIENTS AT THE INSTITUTE FOR ONCOLOGY LJUBLJANA WERE RANDOMIZED TO THE EXPERIMENTAL (N=16) AND TO THE CONTROL GROUPS (N=16). BOTH GROUPS RECEIVED THE SAME STANDARD PHYSIOTHERAPY FOR 1 WEEK, WHILE THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP ADDITIONALLY RECEIVED 1-HOUR GROUP RELAXATION TRAINING SESSION ACCORDING TO THE YIDL(R) SYSTEM PER DAY. AT DISCHARGE, THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS ISSUED WITH AUDIOCASSETTE RECORDINGS CONTAINING SIMILAR INSTRUCTIONS FOR RELAXATION TRAINING TO BE PRACTICED FOR 3 WEEKS INDIVIDUALLY AT HOME. ANXIETY MEASURES WERE OBTAINED BY BLINDED ASSESSORS USING STANDARDIZED QUESTIONNAIRES. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT RELAXATION TRAINING ACCORDING TO THE YIDL(R) SYSTEM COULD BE A USEFUL CLINICAL PHYSIOTHERAPY INTERVENTION FOR BREAST CANCER PATIENTS EXPERIENCING ANXIETY.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
4 1123  22 EFFICACY OF NATUROPATHY AND YOGA IN BRONCHIAL ASTHMA. THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF A ONE MONTH IN-PATIENT NATUROPATHY AND YOGA PROGRAMME FOR PATIENTS WITH ASTHMA. RETROSPECTIVE DATA OF 159 BRONCHIAL ASTHMA PATIENTS, UNDERGOING THE NATUROPATHY AND YOGA PROGRAMME, WAS ANALYZED FOR FORCED VITAL CAPACITY, FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME AT THE END OF 1 SECOND, MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE ON ADMISSION, 11TH DAY, ON DISCHARGE AND ONCE IN THREE MONTHS FOR THREE YEARS. THE PAIRED SAMPLE T TEST RESULTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE FORCED VITAL CAPACITY AND FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME FROM THE DATE OF ADMISSION UP TO 6TH MONTH (P < 0.0035) POST BONFERRONI CORRECTION. MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FROM ADMISSION TILL THE DATE OF DISCHARGE (P < 0.0035) AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FROM ADMISSION TILL THE 36TH MONTH OF FOLLOW-UP (P < 0.0035), POST BONFERRONI CORRECTION. THIS VALIDATED THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF COMBINING NATUROPATHY AND YOGA FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA.	2014

6 1227  41 FEASIBILITY AND EFFICACY OF YOGA AS AN ADD-ON INTERVENTION IN ATTENTION DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER: AN EXPLORATORY STUDY. CONTEXT: ATTENTION DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (ADHD) IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS. STIMULANT MEDICATION IS FREQUENTLY USED IN MANAGEMENT, WITH SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECTS. THERE IS A GROWING INTEREST IN COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENTS LIKE YOGA. AIMS: TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY IN CHILDREN WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE ADHD. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: THE STUDY WAS PERFORMED ON CHILDREN (CONSENT WAS TAKEN FROM PARENTS) ADMITTED IN A CHILD PSYCHIATRY UNIT USING AN OPEN-LABEL EXPLORATORY STUDY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CHILDREN BETWEEN 5 AND 16 YEARS OF AGE DIAGNOSED WITH ADHD AND CO-OPERATIVE FOR YOGA WERE INCLUDED. SUBJECTS WITH OTHER SERIOUS PSYCHIATRIC AND MEDICAL ILLNESSES WERE EXCLUDED. THE PARTICIPANTS WERE GIVEN YOGA TRAINING DAILY DURING THEIR IN-PATIENT STAY. THEY WERE RATED ON CONNERS' ABBREVIATED RATING SCALE - (CARS), ADHD-RATING SCALE-IV (ADHD - RS IV) AND CLINICAL GLOBAL IMPRESSION (CGI)-SEVERITY, AT THE BEGINNING OF STUDY, AT DISCHARGE AND SUBSEQUENTLY AT THE END OF 1(ST), 2(ND) AND 3(RD) MONTH BY A RESEARCH ASSOCIATE NOT INVOLVED IN YOGA INSTRUCTION. PAIRED T-TEST WAS EMPLOYED TO COMPARE THE MEANS OF SCORES BETWEEN BASELINE AND FOLLOW-UPS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 9 CHILDREN (8 MALES, 1 FEMALE) WERE RECRUITED INTO THE STUDY. ALL, BUT ONE WERE ON MEDICATIONS. AN AVERAGE OF 8 YOGA TRAINING SESSIONS WAS GIVEN TO SUBJECTS. THEY WERE ABLE TO LEARN YOGA REASONABLY WELL. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE ADHD SYMPTOMS AS ASSESSED ON CARS (P-0.014), ADHD-RS IV (P=0.021) AND CGI- S SCALES (P=0.004) AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
7  511  50 COMPARATIVE STUDY OF CONVENTIONAL THERAPY AND ADDITIONAL YOGASANAS FOR KNEE REHABILITATION AFTER TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY. BACKGROUND: AMONGST VARIOUS MODALITIES OF POST OPERATIVE REHABILITATION IN A TOTAL KNEE REPLACEMENT (TKR) SURGERY, THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON EVALUATING THE EFFECT OF ADDITIONAL YOGA THERAPY ON FUNCTIONAL OUTCOME OF TKR PATIENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A COMPARATIVE STUDY WAS DONE TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF CONVENTIONAL PHYSIOTHERAPY AND ADDITIONAL YOGA ASANAS, ON 56 PATIENTS UNDERGOING TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY DUE TO OSTEOARTHRITIS. AFTER OBTAINING WRITTEN INFORMED CONSENT, THE PATIENTS WERE ALTERNATELY ASSIGNED TO TWO GROUPS: CONVENTIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL. BASELINE WOMAC SCORES FOR PAIN AND STIFFNESS WERE TAKEN ON THIRD POST OPERATIVE DAY. THE SUBJECTS IN CONVENTIONAL GROUP RECEIVED PHYSIOTHERAPY REHABILITATION PROGRAM OF SANCHETI INSTITUTE WHERE THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED, THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP RECEIVED ADDITIONAL MODIFIED YOGA ASANAS ONCE DAILY BY THE THERAPIST. AFTER DISCHARGE FROM THE HOSPITAL, PATIENTS WERE PROVIDED WITH WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS AND PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE ASANAS, TWO SETS OF WOMAC QUESTIONNAIRE WITH STAMPED AND ADDRESSED ENVELOPES AND WERE INSTRUCTED TO PERFORM YOGA ASANAS 3 DAYS/WEEK. SUBJECTS FILLED THE QUESTIONNAIRE AFTER 6 WEEKS AND 3 MONTHS FROM THE DAY OF SURGERY AND MAILED BACK. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS WOMAC QUESTIONNAIRE WHICH CONSISTS OF 24 QUESTIONS, EACH CORRESPONDING TO A VISUAL ANALOG SCALE, DESIGNED TO MEASURE PATIENT'S PERCEPTION OF PAIN, STIFFNESS AND FUNCTION. RESULTS: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE (P<0.05) FOR ALL THE GROUPS FOR PAIN, STIFFNESS AND FUNCTION SUBSCALES OF WOMAC SCALE. THE PAIN AND STIFFNESS WAS FOUND TO BE LESS IN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP RECEIVING ADDITIONAL YOGA THERAPY THAN IN CONVENTIONAL GROUP ON 3(RD) POST OPERATIVE DAY, 6 WEEKS AND 3 MONTHS AFTER THE SURGERY. CONCLUSION: A COMBINATION OF PHYSIOTHERAPY AND YOGA ASANA PROTOCOL WORKS BETTER THAN ONLY PHYSIOTHERAPY PROTOCOL. LARGER AND BLINDED STUDY IS NEEDED.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
8 1821  45 PROTOCOL FOR TESTING YOGA TO REDUCE POST-LUMBAR SPINE SURGERY PAIN: A METHODOLOGY ARTICLE. CURRENTLY, ACUTE POSTOPERATIVE PAIN DURING HOSPITALIZATION IS PRIMARILY MANAGED BY MEDICATIONS, AND PATIENTS MUST ADHERE TO RESTRICTIVE POSTOPERATIVE PRECAUTIONS FOR 3 MONTHS FOLLOWING LUMBAR SPINE SURGERIES. YOGA CAN BE AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO ASSIST IN ACUTE AND SUBACUTE POSTOPERATIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT, ANXIETY, AND RETURN TO FUNCTION. THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT WORK WAS TO DEVELOP AND TEST THE FEASIBILITY AND EXPLORE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A TAILORED YOGA PROGRAM, DELIVERED IN-PERSON DURING THE HOSPITAL STAY AND ELECTRONICALLY AFTER HOSPITAL DISCHARGE, AS A POTENTIAL NEW AVENUE FOR POSTOPERATIVE CARE. THIS PILOT STUDY WILL USE A CROSSOVER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED DESIGN. INDIVIDUALS AGED BETWEEN 40 AND 80 YEARS WHO ARE SCHEDULED FOR LUMBAR LAMINECTOMY AND/OR FUSION, AND WHO HAVE NOT PRACTICED REGULAR YOGA WITHIN THE PAST 6 MONTHS AT THE TIME OF ENROLLMENT, WILL BE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED TO EITHER A TAILORED YOGA PROGRAM (INTERVENTION GROUP) OR USUAL CARE (CONTROL GROUP) DURING THE HOSPITAL STAY (PHASE ONE). BEARING IN MIND POSTOPERATIVE PRECAUTIONS, ALL SUBJECTS WILL BE INSTRUCTED TO PERFORM A HOME-BASED TAILORED YOGA PROGRAM DELIVERED ELECTRONICALLY VIA YOUTUBE LINKS FOR 8 WEEKS POST-HOSPITAL DISCHARGE (PHASE TWO). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES ASSESSING FEASIBILITY ARE ADHERENCE/COMPLIANCE. SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDE PAIN, ANXIETY, FUNCTION, SLEEP, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND PAIN-CATASTROPHIZING BEHAVIOR.

9 2783  31 YOGA THERAPY AS AN ADJUNCT TO CONVENTIONAL MANAGEMENT OF SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS: A CASE SERIES. SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS (SSC) IS AN AUTOIMMUNE DISORDER LEADING TO SIGNIFICANT DISABILITY AND LOSS OF QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). YOGA HAS BECOME POPULAR IN RECENT TIMES FOR ITS POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS. SINCE THERE ARE NO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS ON THE USE OF YOGA FOR SSC, WE PRESENT TWO FEMALE CASES (AGED 49 AND 29 RESPECTIVELY) OF LIMITED SSC (DURATION OF ILLNESS 4 AND 3 YEARS RESPECTIVELY) WHO UNDERWENT YOGA THERAPY AS AN ADJUNCT TO CONVENTIONAL MANAGEMENT IN A RESIDENTIAL SETTING FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE AND FOUR WEEKS, RESPECTIVELY. DURING THEIR STAY, THEY UNDERWENT A SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED YOGA MODULE. AFTER THEIR DISCHARGE, THEY WERE FOLLOWED-UP FOR FOUR WEEKS, DURING WHICH THEY WERE ASKED TO CONTINUE PRACTICING YOGA FOR 1 H EVERY DAY. BOTH OF THEM REPORTED A REDUCTION IN PAIN, STIFFNESS, SYMPTOM SCORES, AND IMPROVED QOL ON DISCHARGE AND AT THE FOLLOW-UP COMPARED TO THE VALUES ON ADMISSION. ERYTHROCYTE SEDIMENTATION RATE (ESR) AND C-REACTIVE PROTEIN (CRP), AS BIOMARKERS OF INFLAMMATION, REDUCED ON THE DISCHARGE WHEN COMPARED TO THE BASELINE. NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE NOTED DURING THE STAY AND THE FOLLOW-UP. THUS, THE PRESENT CASE SERIES INDICATE A POSSIBLE BENEFICIAL ROLE OF YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT THERAPY TO CONVENTIONAL MANAGEMENT OF SSC. FURTHER STUDIES IN THE AREA ARE WARRANTED TO ASCERTAIN THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR SSC.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
10 2803  24 YOGA THERAPY IN CHRONIC BRONCHITIS. FIFTEEN PATIENTS OF CHRONIC BRONCHITIS RECEIVED YOGA THERAPY IN THE FORM OF PRANAYAM AND 8 TYPES OF 'ASANS' FOR A PERIOD OF 4 WEEKS. THEY HAD A PERCEPTIBLE IMPROVEMENT IN DYSPNOEA AS WAS MEASURED BY VISUAL ANALOG. LUNG FUNCTION PARAMETERS (VC, FEV1, AND PEFR) ALSO IMPROVED AFTER THE PRACTICE OF YOGA.

11  568  29 DECODING THE INTEGRATED APPROACH TO YOGA THERAPY: QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE BASED CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK. AIM: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DEFINE, DECODE, AND APPEND TO THE CONCEPTUAL FRAME-WORK OF THE INTEGRATED APPROACH TO YOGA THERAPY (IAYT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: FOUR STAKEHOLDERS WHO FOLLOWED TWO IN-PATIENTS WITH DEPRESSION OVER A PERIOD OF 2 WEEKS IN THE RESIDENTIAL CENTER AROGYADHAMA (OF SWAMI VIVEKANANDA YOGA ANUSANDANA SAMSTHANA, BANGALORE, INDIA) WERE INTERVIEWED BEFORE THE START OF THE IAYT TREATMENT AND PRIOR TO DISCHARGE OF THE PATIENT. THE PATIENTS WERE ALSO INTERVIEWED PRE AND POST AND WERE OBSERVED ONCE DURING THEIR SESSION. THE DATA FROM THE AUDIO RECORDINGS FROM EIGHT IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WERE TRANSCRIBED MANUALLY AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED. RESULTS: THE CONCEPTUAL FRAME-WORK OF IAYT DEPICTS THAT PATIENT RELATED FACTORS ("CO-OPERATION OF PATIENT", "PATIENTS AWARENESS OF HIS/HER CONDITION"), THERAPIST RELATED FACTORS ("ABILITY TO GUIDE", "THE ASSISTANCE TO THE PATIENTS", "EXPLANATION OF THE EXERCISES") AND TREATMENT RELATED FACTORS ("COMBINATION OF PSYCHIATRIC OR AYURVEDIC MEDICATION WITH YOGA", "COUNSELING DURING THE IAYT TREATMENT", DURATION OF TREATMENT), PLAY AN INTEGRATED ROLE IN REACHING THE "AIM OF IAYT" AND EXPERIENCING "IMPROVEMENTS AND CHANGES". CONCLUSION: THE IAYT IS A HOLISTIC PROGRAM AND THE ABILITY OF THE PATIENT TO COOPERATE WITH AND INTEGRATE THE AVAILABLE FACTORS (THERAPIST RELATED AND TREATMENT RELATED) COULD ENABLE BEST RESULTS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
12 1272  32 FROM 200 BC TO 2015 AD: AN INTEGRATION OF ROBOTIC SURGERY AND AYURVEDA/YOGA. BACKGROUND: AMONG THE TRADITIONAL SYSTEMS OF MEDICINE PRACTICED ALL OVER THE WORLD, AYURVEDA AND YOGA HAS A DOCUMENTED HISTORY DATING BACK TO BEYOND 200 BC. ROBOTIC AND VIDEO ASSISTED THORACIC SURGERY (VATS) IS AN INVENTION OF THE 21(ST) CENTURY. WE AIM TO QUANTIFY THE EFFECTS OF INTEGRATION OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA ON PATIENTS UNDERGOING MINIMALLY INVASIVE ROBOTIC AND VATS. METHODS: FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY-FOUR PATIENTS UNDERGOING VATS AND ROBOTIC THORACIC SURGERY WERE INTRODUCED TO A PRE AND POSTOPERATIVE PROTOCOL OF YOGA THERAPY, MEDIATION AND OIL MASSAGES. YOGA EXERCISES INCLUDED PRANAYAM, ANULOM VILOM, AND OIL MASSAGES INCLUDED UROTARPAN. PREOPERATIVE AND POSTOPERATIVE RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS WERE RECORDED. PATIENT SATISFACTION QUESTIONNAIRE WERE NOTED. STATISTICAL COMPARISON WAS MADE TO CONTROL GROUP UNDERGOING MINIMALLY INVASIVE THORACIC SURGERY WITHOUT INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE. ONLY ONE PATIENT REFUSED TO UNDERGO AYURVEDA THERAPY AND WAS DELETED FROM THE GROUP. RESULTS: ACCEPTABILITY WAS HIGH AMONG ALL PATIENTS. PREOPERATIVE TRAINING LED TO IMPLEMENTATION AS EARLY AS 6 HOURS POST SURGERY. PULMONARY FUNCTION TEST SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. ALL PATIENTS SUGGESTED AN IMPROVEMENT IN SATISFACTION SCORE. PAIN SCORE WERE LESS IN STUDY PATIENTS. QUICKER MOBILIZATION LED TO EARLY DISCHARGE AND DRAIN REMOVAL. CHRONIC PAIN WAS PREVENTED IN PATIENTS HAVING OIL MASSAGES OVER THE HEALED WOUND SITES. CONCLUSIONS: INTEGRATION OF AYURVEDA, YOGA AND MINIMALLY INVASIVE ROBOTIC AND VATS IS ACCEPTABLE TO INDIAN PATIENTS AND GIVES BETTER CLINICAL RESULTS AND HIGHER PATIENT SATISFACTION.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
13  651  35 EAST MEETS WEST IN PSYCHIATRY: YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT THERAPY FOR MANAGEMENT OF ANXIETY. PURPOSE: PROVIDE YOGA FOR COPING AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT IN A LOCKED, ADULT INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC UNIT. DESIGN: HATHA YOGA WAS OFFERED TO INPATIENTS WITH MOOD DISORDERS AND/OR PSYCHOSIS 3 TIMES PER WEEK IN THIS EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE CHANGE PROJECT. IMPACT ON SLEEP WAS EXAMINED USING RECORDED SLEEP HOURS. ANXIETY SYMPTOMS WERE ASSESSED USING 6 OF THE 7 SYMPTOMS RECORDED ON THE GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDERS (GAD) 7. SUSTAINABILITY OF BENEFITS WAS EXAMINED. A SELF-ASSESSMENT WAS CONDUCTED AT DISCHARGE TO DETERMINE ACQUISITION OF NEW COPING SKILLS. RESULTS: NO DIFFERENCE IN SLEEP HOURS OR INTERRUPTIONS WAS NOTED. A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE TOTAL ANXIETY SCORES (Z=-1.9815, P=0.02385) AND SUSTAINABILITY OF BENEFITS (Z=-2.0894, P=0.03662) BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND YOGA CLASS WERE OBSERVED. A POSITIVE CHANGE FROM BASELINE IN SUSTAINABILITY OF SYMPTOMS FOR "LESS ANXIETY" (K=0.108) AND "MORE RELAXED" (K=0.083) WAS FOUND. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN UTILIZATION OF YOGA (P=0.0015) AND MEDITATION (P=0.013) AS COPING MECHANISMS AT DISCHARGE. CONCLUSIONS: ADULTS IN AN ACUTE INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC UNIT WHO PARTICIPATED IN YOGA PRACTICE IDENTIFIED YOGA AND MEDITATION AS NEWLY-ACQUIRED COPING MECHANISMS AND REPORTED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ANXIETY SYMPTOMS WITH SUSTAINED BENEFITS RANGING FROM HALF DAY TO FULL DAY.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
14  733  57 EFFECT OF MULA BANDHA YOGA IN MILD GRADE PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE IS THE GROWING HEALTH ISSUE RELATED TO WOMEN OF THE REPRODUCTIVE AND POSTMENOPAUSAL AGE GROUP IN INDIA AND ACROSS THE GLOBE. TREATMENT OPTION FOR PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE INCLUDES BOTH SURGICAL AND NON-SURGICAL INTERVENTION. THE DEVELOPMENT OF PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE IS AN INDICATION FOR MAJOR SURGERY AMONG 20% OF ALL WOMEN. NEVERTHELESS, THE RECURRENCE OF PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE IS DETECTED AMONG 58% OF THE PATIENT AFTER SURGERY. THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR PREVENTIVE MEASURES FOR REDUCING THE IMPACT OF PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE. AIMS AND OBJECTIVE: TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF 3 MONTHS YOGA THERAPY IN FEMALE PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM MILD PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 50 PARTICIPANTS WERE ALLOCATED INTO TWO GROUPS (25 IN EACH GROUP) BY GENERATING RANDOM ALLOCATION SEQUENCE. WOMEN AGED 20-60 WITH SYMPTOMATIC MILD PELVIC ORGAN PROLAPSE IN THE YOGA GROUP WERE OFFERED MULABANDHA YOGA THERAPY ALONG WITH OTHER CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT MODALITIES, WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP WAS ONLY ON CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT. ALL PARTICIPANTS GAVE WRITTEN INFORMED CONSENT. AN ASSESSMENT WAS DONE BY IMPROVEMENT IN CHIEF COMPLAINTS AND PELVIC FLOOR DISTRESS INVENTORY-20 (PFDI-20) & PELVIC FLOOR IMPACT QUESTIONNAIRE-7 (PFIQ-7) AT BASELINE AND AT THE END OF 4, 8 & 12 WEEKS. RESULTS AT THE END OF 12 WEEKS, POST-STUDY COMPARISON BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN CHIEF COMPLAINTS LIKE PERENNIAL PAIN, P/V DISCHARGE, PERINEAL MUSCLE LAXITY AND FEELING OF SOMETHING COMING OUT P/V (P < 0.001). PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP IMPROVED BY (ON AVERAGE) 5.7 (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL 3.1 TO 14.7) POINTS MORE ON THE PFDI-20 THAN DID PARTICIPANTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP (P = 0.1) AND A MEAN SCORE OF PFIQ-7 WAS ALSO IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY. CONCLUSIONS: ALTHOUGH MULABANDHA (ROOT LOCK) YOGA THERAPY LED TO A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN PFDI-20 & PFIQ-7 SCORES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GROUPS WAS BELOW THE PRESUMED LEVEL OF CLINICAL RELEVANCE (15 POINTS). MORE STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO IDENTIFY FACTORS RELATED TO THE SUCCESS OF MULABANDHA (ROOT LOCK) YOGA THERAPY AND TO INVESTIGATE LONG-TERM EFFECTS.	2018

AYURVEDIC DIAGNOSIS WAS AMAVATA (A CLINICAL CONDITION CHARACTERISED BY JOINT INFLAMMATION) THE PATIENT WAS MANAGED AS OUTPATIENT FOR ELEVEN DAYS AND HOSPITALISED FOR THIRTY THREE DAYS. INTERNAL MEDICINES AND EXTERNAL THERAPIES WITH DIET MODIFICATION, LIFESTYLE ADJUSTMENTS, COUNSELLING, YOGA AND IAM TECHNIQUE (INTEGRATED AMRITA MEDITATION TECHNIQUE ) WERE ADMINISTERED DURING THE HOSPITAL STAY. AT YEARLY FOLLOW UP, C-REACTIVE PROTEIN WAS REDUCED TO 15.7 MG/L FROM THE BASELINE VALUE OF 37.5 MG/L, AND ESR FROM 103 MM/H TO 8 MM/H INDICATING REDUCTION IN INFLAMMATION. THE DOSE OF NSAID AND DMARD (DISEASE MODIFYING ANTIRHEUMATIC DRUG) COULD BE REDUCED FROM ONCE IN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS TO ONCE IN EIGHTY-FOUR HOURS AND STEROIDS FROM TWICE DAILY TO ONCE IN A WEEK. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PAIN AND STIFFNESS. INTEGRATION OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA WITH CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT CAN REDUCE DRUG DEPENDENCE AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE IN AS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
16  135  28 A PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECTS OF ONE YOGA SESSION FOR SERVICE RECIPIENTS IN A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT PROGRAM. THIS WAS AN INVESTIGATION OF THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF A BRIEF YOGA INTERVENTION (ONE SESSION) WITHIN AN INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT PROGRAM (IOP) FOR SERVICE RECIPIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH VARIOUS PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS. PARTICIPANTS (N=26) COMPLETED THE TORONTO MINDFULNESS SCALE (TMS) AND THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECT SCHEDULE (PANAS). DATA WAS COLLECTED BEFORE AND AFTER ONE YOGA SESSION AND FOLLOW-UP DATA WAS COLLECTED VIA MAIL AFTER DISCHARGE FROM THE IOP. SCORES INDICATED THAT NEGATIVE AFFECT SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED AND POSITIVE AFFECT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FROM PRE TO POST YOGA SESSION. MINDFULNESS SCORES SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FROM PRE TO POST YOGA SESSION. THOUGH THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SUPPORTED THAT A YOGA INTERVENTION IS BOTH FEASIBLE AND EFFECTIVE WITHIN AN IOP, COLLECTION OF FOLLOW-UP DATA AFTER DISCHARGE VIA MAIL WAS NOT AS FEASIBLE. THE RESULTS OF THIS PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION SUPPORT A LARGER AND LONGITUDINAL STUDY TO FURTHER EXAMINE YOGA AS A TREATMENT MODALITY WITH THIS CLINICAL POPULATION.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
17  904  43 EFFECTIVENESS OF ADJUVANT YOGA THERAPY IN DIABETIC LUNG: A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL. CONTEXT: RECENT STUDIES PROVIDE AMPLE EVIDENCE OF THE BENEFITS OF YOGA IN VARIOUS CHRONIC DISORDERS. DIABETES MELLITUS IS A GROUP OF METABOLIC DISEASES CHARACTERIZED BY CHRONIC HYPERGLYCEMIA AND SANDLER COINED THE TERM "DIABETIC LUNG" FOR THE ABNORMAL PULMONARY FUNCTION DETECTED IN DIABETIC PATIENTS DUE UNDERLYING PULMONARY DYSFUNCTION. YOGA THERAPY MAY HELP IN ACHIEVING BETTER PULMONARY FUNCTION ALONG WITH ENHANCED GLYCAEMIC CONTROL AND OVERALL HEALTH BENEFITS. AIM: TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF ADJUVANT YOGA THERAPY IN DIABETIC LUNG THROUGH SPIROMETRY. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL WAS MADE AS INTERDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATIVE WORK BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS OF YOGA THERAPY, PULMONARY MEDICINE AND ENDOCRINOLOGY, OF MGMC & RI, SRI BALAJI VIDYAPEETH PUDUCHERRY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 72 PATIENTS OF DIABETIC LUNG AS CONFIRMED BY SPIROMETRY (<70% OF EXPECTED) WERE RANDOMIZED INTO CONTROL GROUP (N=36) WHO RECEIVED ONLY STANDARD MEDICAL TREATMENT AND YOGA GROUP (N=36) WHO RECEIVED YOGA TRAINING THRICE WEEKLY FOR 4 MONTHS ALONG WITH STANDARD MEDICAL MANAGEMENT. YOGA THERAPY PROTOCOL INCLUDED YOGIC COUNSELING, PREPARATORY PRACTICES, ASANAS OR STATIC POSTURES, PRANAYAMA OR BREATHING TECHNIQUES AND RELAXATION TECHNIQUES. HATHENAS OF THE GITANANDA YOGA TRADITION WERE THE MAIN PRACTICES USED. SPIROMETRY WAS DONE AT THE END OF THE STUDY PERIOD. DATA WAS ANALYZED BY STUDENT'S PAIRED AND UNPAIRED 'T' TEST AS IT PASSED NORMALITY. RESULTS: THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.05) REDUCTION IN WEIGHT, AND BMI ALONG WITH A SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.01) IMPROVEMENT IN PULMONARY FUNCTION (FEV1, FVC) IN YOGA GROUP AS COMPARED TO CONTROL GROUP WHERE PARAMETERS WORSENED OVER STUDY PERIOD. CONCLUSION: IT IS CONCLUDED FROM THE PRESENT RCT THAT YOGA HAS A DEFINITE ROLE AS AN ADJUVANT THERAPY AS IT ENHANCES STANDARD MEDICAL CARE AND HENCE IS EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT IN ROUTINE CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES, IMPROVING PHYSICAL CONDITION AND PULMONARY FUNCTION.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
18 1914  27 ROLE OF INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY IN A FAILED POST-TOTAL KNEE REPLACEMENT OF BILATERAL KNEES. OA KNEE IS THE MOST COMMON ARTHRITIS. KNEE REPLACEMENT SURGERIES ARE BEING DONE INCREASINGLY IN THE PRESENT TIMES. THIS HAS LED TO THE VIOLATION OF THE STANDARD INDICATIONS AND WHEN KNEES ARE REPLACED IGNORING OTHER CO - MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS IT RESULTS IN THE SURGERY FAILING EARLY. THIS IS ABOUT A PATIENT WHO ENCOUNTERED A FAILED TKR DUE TO IMPROPER SELECTION AS PATIENT HAD BILATERAL OA HIP THAT WAS IGNORED IN THE INITIAL STAGES. TO OVERCOME THE PROBLEM SHE WAS ADVISED BILATERAL HIP REPLACEMENT WHICH WOULD LEAVE HER WITH FOUR REPLACEMENTS IN THE LOWER LIMB. SHE REFUSED SURGERY AND WAS TOLD THERE ARE NO ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS. THIS PATIENT UNDERWENT A 3 WEEK INTEGRATED COURSE OF IAYT AT OUR CENTER AND SHE MADE A REMARKABLE RECOVERY. IAYT IS A GOOD NON-SURGICAL TREATMENT THAT CAN BE AFFECTIVE BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER KNEE REPLACEMENT AND IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS THE FIRST CHOICE OF TREATMENT BEFORE SURGERY.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
19 2855  38 YOGA-AN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH BLUNT CHEST TRAUMA: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: YOGA AS ALTERNATIVE FORM OF THERAPY HAS SHOWN POSITIVE IMPACT ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS, EXERCISE CAPACITY, BEHAVIORAL CHANGES, AND INFLAMMATION IN NON-TRAUMA PATIENTS. HOWEVER, THE EFFICACY OF YOGA HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED IN CHEST TRAUMA PATIENTS. METHODS: THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED AT LEVEL-1 TRAUMA CENTRE. ISOLATED CHEST INJURY PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO EITHER STANDARD PHYSIOTHERAPY OR YOGATHERAPY GROUPS. PATIENTS IN PHYSIOTHERAPY GROUP RECEIVED CONVENTIONAL CHEST PHYSIOTHERAPY AND YOGATHERAPY GROUP RECEIVED A SET OF YOGIC EXERCISES IN ADDITION TO CONVENTIONAL CHEST PHYSIOTHERAPY. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS CHANGES IN PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS (PFT) AT 4 WEEKS OF DISCHARGE. SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE CHANGES IN QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), RESPIRATORY MUSCLE STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE, CHEST WALL MOBILITY, AND LEVELS OF CYTOKINES AT 4 WEEKS. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING STATA V14.0. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 89 ELIGIBLE PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO PHYSIOTHERAPY (N = 46) AND YOGA THERAPY (N = 43) GROUPS. DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS WERE COMPARABLE IN BOTH THE GROUPS. THERE WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN PFT IN THE YOGATHERAPY GROUP COMPARED WITH PHYSIOTHERAPY WITH AN INCREASE IN FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (P = 0.02) AND FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME (P = 0.01) AT 4 WEEKS. IN ADDITION, THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PHYSICAL COMPONENT OF QOL, RESPIRATORY MUSCLE ENDURANCE (P = 0.003) AND AXILLARY CIRTOMETRY (P = 0.009) IN THE YOGATHERAPY GROUP. HOWEVER, NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE TRENDS OF CYTOKINE MARKERS SEEN BETWEEN THE GROUPS. CONCLUSION: YOGA WAS FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING PULMONARY FUNCTIONS AND QOL IN PATIENTS WITH CHEST TRAUMA.

20 2786  44 YOGA THERAPY AS AN ADJUVANT IN MANAGEMENT OF ASTHMA. OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON CONTROL OF ASTHMA IN CHILDREN WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA. METHODS: THIS HOSPITAL-BASED INTERVENTIONAL RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL CONDUCTED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PEDIATRICS AT A TERTIARY CARE CENTER OF NORTH INDIA FROM NOVEMBER 2017 TO OCTOBER 2018 ENROLLED 140 NEWLY DIAGNOSED CASES OF ASTHMA OF AGE 10-16 Y WHO WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS. SEVENTY CHILDREN IN THE CASE GROUP PRACTICED YOGA UNDER SUPERVISION FOR A PERIOD OF 3 MO IN ADDITION TO PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT. SEVENTY CONTROLS RECEIVED ONLY PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT. PULMONARY-FUNCTION TESTS WERE DONE AT BASELINE, 6 WK, AND 12 WK ALONG WITH QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) ASSESSMENT BY PEDIATRIC ASTHMA QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE (PAQLQ). THE OUTCOME MEASURES ASSESSED WERE FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN ONE SECOND (FEV1), FEV1/FVC AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR). QOL EVALUATION WAS DONE IN 3 DOMAINS: ACTIVITY LIMITATION, SYMPTOMS, AND EMOTIONAL FUNCTION. RESULTS: THE ASTHMATIC CHILDREN PRACTICING YOGA HAVE SHOWN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC AND PEFR WHICH WAS BETTER AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS. IMPROVEMENT WAS ALSO NOTED IN MEAN-PAQLQ SCORE IN CASES WHICH WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS. CONCLUSION: YOGA APPEARS TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECT ON CONTROL OF ASTHMA MEASURED BY PULMONARY-FUNCTION TEST AND QOL. THEREFORE YOGA THERAPY CAN BE RECOMMENDED AS AN ADJUVANT IN MANAGEMENT OF ASTHMA ALONG WITH STANDARD PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT.	2021

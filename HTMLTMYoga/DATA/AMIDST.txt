1    2 149 "A STUDY PROTOCOL FOR A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL ON THE EFFICACY OF YOGA AS AN ADJUVANT THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS AMIDST COVID-19 PANDEMIC". BACKGROUND: AMIDST THE ADVERSITIES OF THE COVID 19 PANDEMIC, THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM HAS SEEN A NEW PARADIGM SHIFT TOWARDS E-HEALTH SERVICES. IN THE ADVENT OF CATERING TO THE GEOMETRICALLY INCREASING HEALTH CARE NEEDS OF THE PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM VARIOUS CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS WHEN IN SOCIAL ISOLATION, THE NEED FOR THE SHIFT SEEMS TO BE PARAMOUNT. PATIENTS WITH ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS UNDER IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS AND VARIABLE DEGREES OF DISABILITIES ARE AT HIGHER RISK. THIS STUDY AIMS TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF E-YOGA AS A TREATMENT OPTION FOR THESE PATIENTS IN NEED. METHODS: THIS IS A SINGLE-CENTER, PARALLEL-GROUP PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED, OPEN-BLINDED END-POINT TRIAL. PATIENTS AGED BETWEEN 30 TO 50 YEARS WILL BE RECRUITED FROM THE MEMBERS OF ANTARDHWANI: A SOCIETY OF ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS, AHMEDABAD, GUJARAT. THE YOGA EXPERTS WILL ADMINISTER A SCIENTIFICALLY DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED YOGA MODULE VIA E-YOGA MODALITIES. A TOTAL OF 135 PATIENTS WILL BE RECRUITED AND RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS. DATA WILL BE RECORDED AT BASELINE AND THREE MONTHS ON DISEASE ACTIVITY, DEGREE OF FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS IN PATIENTS, QUALITY OF LIFE, INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS, DEPRESSION, AND ANXIETY USING BATH AS DISEASE ACTIVITY INDEX (BASDAI), BATH AS FUNCTIONAL INDEX(BASFI), AS QUALITY OF LIFE INDEX(ASQOL), C REACTIVE PROTEIN (CRP), ERYTHROCYTE SEDIMENTATION RATE (ESR), PHYSICAL HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE-4 (PHQ-4), RESPECTIVELY. DISCUSSION: THE STUDY WILL REPORT THE EFFICACY OF E-YOGA IN CATERING TO THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL INSUFFICIENCIES OF INPATIENTS WITH ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS AMIDST COVID 19 PANDEMIC. THE STUDY IS PROSPECTIVELY REGISTERED IN THE CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY OF INDIA (CTRI/2020/08/027215).	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                         
2 1878  22 REALIZING YOGA'S ALL-ACCESS PASS: A SOCIAL JUSTICE CRITIQUE OF WESTERNIZED YOGA AND INCLUSIVE EMBODIMENT. IN THE 21(ST) CENTURY, THE ANCIENT MIND-BODY PRACTICE OF YOGA HAS SURGED IN POPULARITY AMONG WESTERN ENTHUSIASTS FOR ITS NUMEROUS HEALTH BENEFITS. PARTICULARLY, A GROWING EVIDENCE BASE SUPPORTS YOGA FOR CULTIVATING POSITIVE EMBODIMENT AND REDUCING RISK FOR DISORDERED EATING. NEVERTHELESS, AMIDST ITS RISE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT YOGA'S DEPARTURE FROM ITS SPIRITUAL FOUNDATIONS AND INCREASING ASSIMILATION INTO THE APPEARANCE- AND COMMERCIAL-DRIVEN EXERCISE AND FITNESS CULTURE. CONSEQUENTLY, AN EXCLUSIONARY IDENTITY HAS BEEN PERPETUATED IN SHAPING NORMS SURROUNDING WHO CAN AND DOES PRACTICE YOGA, WHICH CONTRADICTS EARLIER EGALITARIAN VISIONS OF A YOGA FOR ALL. THEREFORE, WE ADOPT A SOCIAL JUSTICE LENS IN OFFERING A FOCUSED ANALYSIS OF THE INTERSECTION OF YOGA, EMBODIMENT, AND INCLUSION FOR SELECT MARGINALIZED SOCIAL IDENTITIES TYPICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND IN YOGA SCHOLARSHIP. DATA ARE SYNTHESIZED FROM BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE SOURCES AND INTEGRATE AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW CONFINED MEDIA REPRESENTATIONS OF "THE YOGA BODY" AND OTHER PRACTICAL CONSTRAINTS MAY UNDERMINE THE PERCEIVED ACCESS TO THE PRACTICE FOR MEMBERS OF DIVERSE GROUPS. WE CONCLUDE WITH INVITING FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS TOWARDS FOSTERING MORE INTERDISCIPLINARY COMMUNITY-BASED RESEARCH PARTNERSHIPS AMONG THE VARIETY OF STAKEHOLDERS INVESTED IN ADVANCING THE ACCESSIBILITY AND INCLUSION OF YOGA AND POSITIVE EMBODIMENT FOR ALL BODIES.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
3  124  22 A PILOT STUDY OF YOGA FOR CHRONIC HEADACHES IN YOUTH: PROMISE AMIDST CHALLENGES. THE PRIMARY AIM OF THE CURRENT STUDY WAS TO PROVIDE PRELIMINARY DATA ON THE FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND SAFETY OF ALIGNMENT-BASED YOGA FOR YOUTHS WITH CHRONIC HEADACHES. A SECONDARY AIM WAS TO PROVIDE PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES OF YOGA'S ABILITY TO IMPROVE HEADACHE PAIN, DAILY FUNCTIONING, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND ANXIETY LEVEL IN THIS POPULATION. THE YOGA INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF 8 WEEKLY, 75-MINUTE CLASSES. PARTICIPANT FLOW DATA REVEALED CHALLENGES TO FEASIBILITY PRIMARILY DUE TO RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION. SCORES ON MOST OUTCOME MEASURES CHANGED IN THE PREDICTED DIRECTION WITH MEDIUM EFFECT SIZES FOUND FOR THE FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES. PAIN MEASURES DID NOT CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY. THIS PILOT SUGGESTS THAT YOGA FOR PEDIATRIC HEADACHES MAY BE ACCEPTABLE, AS INDICATED BY POSITIVE PARENT AND PARTICIPANT RATINGS OF THE YOGA EXPERIENCE. THESE PRELIMINARY FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA TRIALS FOR PEDIATRIC HEADACHES INCLUDE BOTH CHALLENGES AND PROMISE. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OVERCOMING CHALLENGES INCLUDE DESIGNS THAT OPTIMIZE FAMILY CONVENIENCE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
4 2304  23 TOWARD AN EXPLANATORY FRAMEWORK FOR YOGA THERAPY INFORMED BY PHILOSOPHICAL AND ETHICAL PERSPECTIVES. CONTEXT * YOGA THERAPY IS AN EMERGING COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH PRACTICE FOR WHICH THERE IS INCREASING INTEREST FROM BOTH CLINICAL AND RESEARCH PERSPECTIVES. CURRENTLY MISSING, HOWEVER, IS AN EXPLANATORY FRAMEWORK FOR THE PROFESSION THAT PROVIDES PRACTITIONERS, CLIENTS, AND THE PUBLIC WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW VARIOUS YOGIC TRADITIONS AND PRINCIPLES CAN BE UNDERSTOOD IN MODERN HEALTH CARE CONTEXTS. OBJECTIVE * THIS STUDY PROPOSES AN EXPLANATORY FRAMEWORK FOR YOGA THERAPY, INFORMED BY PHENOMENOLOGY, EUDAIMONIA, VIRTUE ETHICS, AND FIRST-PERSON ETHICAL INQUIRY. CONCLUSIONS * THESE 4 PHILOSOPHICAL PERSPECTIVES-PHENOMENOLOGY, EUDAIMONIA, VIRTUE ETHICS, AND FIRST-PERSON ETHICAL INQUIRY-PROVIDE A LENS THROUGH WHICH TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOGIC PRACTICES SUPPORT THE INDIVIDUAL'S TRANSFORMATION IN THE EXPERIENCE OF ILLNESS, PAIN, OR DISABILITY. WE PROPOSE THAT THIS TRANSFORMATION OCCURS THROUGH FACILITATING A REHARMONIZATION OF BODY, MIND, AND ENVIRONMENT TOWARD THE EXPERIENCE OF EUDAIMONIC WELL-BEING.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
5 2517  18 YOGA COMMUNITIES AND EATING DISORDERS: CREATING SAFE SPACE FOR POSITIVE EMBODIMENT. WITH ADEQUATE EDUCATION AND GUIDANCE, YOGA COMMUNITIES, AS PART OF THE THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPE IN THE 21ST CENTURY, CAN PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE PROMOTING POSITIVE EMBODIMENT FOR THOSE WITH, AND AT-RISK FOR, EATING DISORDERS (EDS). TO DO THIS, YOGA TEACHERS NEED TO KNOW HOW TO CREATE A BODY-POSITIVE COMMUNITY AND BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE AND RESPOND TO THOSE AT RISK AND STRUGGLING WITH EDS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS YOGA TEACHING METHODS ASSOCIATED WITH EDS AND ED RISK, BROADER CONCEPTUAL APPROACHES AND SPECIFIC PRACTICES ASSOCIATED WITH POSITIVE EMBODIMENT ARE OFFERED. THESE INCLUDE THE BROADER CONCEPTUAL APPROACHES OF: INTENTIONAL INCLUSION AND ACCEPTANCE, EXPERIENTIAL EMPHASIS, SUPPORTING POSITIVE EMBODIMENT AND INQUIRY. STUDIO PRAGMATICS ARE ALSO DETAILED AS RELATED TO THE BODY, BREATH, EMOTIONS, AND COMMUNITY. ASSESSMENT, REFERRAL, AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT ARE ALSO ADDRESSED.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
6 2035  24 TELE-YOGA FOR CHRONIC PAIN: CURRENT STATUS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS. PAIN IS A PERVASIVE, DEBILITATING DISORDER THAT IS RESISTANT TO LONG-TERM PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS. ALTHOUGH PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPIES SUCH AS COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY DEMONSTRATE MODERATE EFFICACY, MANY INDIVIDUALS CONTINUE TO HAVE ONGOING DIFFICULTIES FOLLOWING TREATMENT. THERE IS A CURRENT TREND TO ESTABLISH COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH INTERVENTIONS FOR CHRONIC PAIN, FOR WHICH YOGA HAS BEEN FOUND TO HAVE EXCITING POTENTIAL. NEVERTHELESS, AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION WITHIN THE FIELD IS ACCESSIBILITY TO ADEQUATE CARE. TELEHEALTH CAN BE USED TO PROVIDE REAL-TIME INTERACTIVE VIDEO CONFERENCING LEADING TO INCREASED ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FOR INDIVIDUALS LOCATED REMOTELY OR WHO OTHERWISE HAVE DIFFICULTY ACCESSING SERVICES, PERHAPS THROUGH ISSUES OF MOBILITY OR PROXIMITY OF ADEQUATE SERVICES. THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES THE CURRENT STATUS AND FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING TELE-YOGA FOR CHRONIC PAIN. METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH ARE DISCUSSED.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
7  653  21 EATING DISORDERS, EMBODIMENT, AND YOGA: A CONCEPTUAL OVERVIEW. YOGA AND ITS RELATION TO EMBODIMENT AND DISORDERED EATING HAS ONLY RECENTLY RECEIVED RESEARCH ATTENTION. NEVERTHELESS, EARLY RESEARCH INDICATES THAT YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF EATING DISORDERS. IT IS ASSUMED THAT YOGA AMELIORATES EATING DISORDER SYMPTOMS AND FACILITATES A SHIFT FROM NEGATIVE TOWARDS POSITIVE BODY IMAGE AND WELL-BEING BY CULTIVATING POSITIVE EMBODIMENT (I.E., THE ABILITY TO FEEL A SENSE OF CONNECTION BETWEEN MIND AND BODY). IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE CONTEXT OF THE CONSTRUCTS OF DISORDERED EATING, EMBODIMENT, AND YOGA, THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A BRIEF OVERVIEW AND CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THESE CONSTRUCTS. THE THREE MAJOR EATING DISORDERS AND CURRENT TREATMENT METHODS ARE DESCRIBED. FURTHER, THE PHILOSOPHICAL ROOTS AND THEORETICAL MODELS OF EMBODIMENT ARE DELINEATED AND THEIR COMMUNAL CORE FEATURES ARE OUTLINED. LASTLY, THE ORIGIN, BASIC PRINCIPLES, AND MODERN INTERPRETATIONS OF YOGA ARE DISCUSSED.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
8 1911  25 ROLE OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE IN THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC - A NARRATIVE REVIEW. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS POSED AN IMMENSE CHALLENGE TO HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AROUND THE GLOBE IN TERMS OF LIMITED HEALTH CARE FACILITIES AND PROVEN MEDICAL THERAPEUTICS TO ADDRESS THE SYMPTOMS OF THE INFECTION. THE CURRENT HEALTH CARE STRATEGIES ARE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON EITHER THE PATHOGEN OR THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. HOWEVER, EFFORTS TOWARDS STRENGTHENING THE HOST IMMUNITY ARE IMPORTANT FROM PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF INFECTION AND DOWNREGULATE THE POTENCY OF THE INFECTIOUS AGENT. WHILE A VACCINE CAN INDUCE SPECIFIC IMMUNITY IN THE HOST, NON-SPECIFIC WAYS OF IMPROVING OVERALL HOST IMMUNITY ARE NEEDED AS WELL. THIS SCENARIO HAS PAVED THE WAY FOR THE USE OF TRADITIONAL INDIAN THERAPIES SUCH AS AYURVEDA AND YOGA. THIS REVIEW AIMS AT COLLATING AVAILABLE EVIDENCE ON AYURVEDA, YOGA, AND COVID-19. FURTHER, IT DRAWS INFERENCES FROM RECENT STUDIES ON YOGA AND AYURVEDA ON IMMUNITY, RESPIRATORY HEALTH, AND MENTAL HEALTH RESPECTIVELY TO APPROXIMATE ITS PROBABLE ROLE IN PROPHYLAXIS AND AS AN ADD-ON MANAGEMENT OPTION FOR THE CURRENT PANDEMIC.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
9 2773  22 YOGA RESEARCH AND SPIRITUALITY: A CASE STUDY DISCUSSION. THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE THAT YOGA CAN BE BENEFICIAL AS AN ASPECT OF SELF-CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH ARTHRITIS. HOWEVER, YOGA MAY BE LESS ACCEPTABLE TO THOSE FROM DIFFERENT CULTURES, SOCIOECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS, AND RACIAL/ETHNIC IDENTITIES. WHILE IMPLEMENTING A FEASIBILITY/ACCEPTABILITY PILOT STUDY OF YOGA AS SELF-CARE IN MINORITY COMMUNITIES, THE SUBJECT OF SPIRITUALITY SURFACED. THIS COMMENTARY SHARES THE EXPERIENCE OF THE RESEARCHERS AND YOGA TEACHERS COLLABORATING ON THE STUDY AND THE LARGER CONVERSATION THAT ENSUED FOLLOWING THE WITHDRAWAL OF ONE OF THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS. IT IS AN ATTEMPT TO START A RELEVANT AND NEEDED DIALOGUE AROUND YOGA RESEARCH AS AN INTEGRATIVE HEALTH MODALITY, AND WHY THE UNDERLYING BODY-MIND-SPIRIT APPROACH TO YOGA MAY SOMETIMES SERVE AS A BARRIER TO PARTICIPATION FOR DIVERSE POPULATIONS SUFFERING FROM ARTHRITIS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
10 2346  22 USING REALIST EVALUATION TO UNDERSTAND PROCESS OUTCOMES IN A COVID-19-IMPACTED YOGA INTERVENTION TRIAL: A WORKED EXAMPLE. REALIST EVALUATION OFFERS A VALUABLE WAY TO UNDERSTAND HOW INTERVENTIONS FUNCTION AND THUS HOW THEY CAN BE IMPROVED AND LOCALLY ADAPTED. CONSEQUENTLY, REALIST EVALUATION IS INCREASINGLY CONDUCTED IN PARALLEL WITH INTERVENTION TRIALS. IT COMPRISES A CLEAR PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATION AND VIEW OF CAUSALITY, PRAGMATIC MIXED DATA COLLECTION METHODS, AND A THEORY-DRIVEN APPROACH IN WHICH HYPOTHESISED PROGRAM THEORIES ARE TESTED AND REFINED. HOWEVER, DETAILED METHODS FOR DATA ANALYSIS ARE SELDOM WELL-DESCRIBED IN REALIST STUDIES AND NO CLEAR METHOD FOR ANALYSING AND PRESENTING REALIST EVALUATION DATA HAS YET EMERGED. IN THIS METHODOLOGICAL PAPER WE USE THE WORKED EXAMPLE OF OUR REALIST PROCESS EVALUATION OF THE SAGE YOGA TRIAL TO ILLUSTRATE AN APPLIED PROCESS OF DATA ANALYSIS AND PRESENTATION OF FINDINGS. WE SHOW HOW WE DREW ON OTHER REALIST STUDIES FOR IDEAS, PROVIDE EXAMPLES OF SIX KEY TASKS INVOLVED IN CONDUCTING A REALIST PROCESS EVALUATION (INCLUDING CODING DATA AND STRUCTURING RESULTS) AND DESCRIBE STRATEGIES THAT DID NOT WORK AND OUR RATIONALE FOR REJECTING THEM. THIS DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE DECISIONS AND METHODS THAT WORKED FOR US IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE A PRACTICAL AND INFORMED POINT OF DEPARTURE FOR RESEARCHERS CONDUCTING A REALIST EVALUATION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
11 2373  22 WHAT IS OUR "EPISTEMIC RESPONSIBILITY"? REFLECTIONS ON SOCIAL WORK'S ORIENTATION IN YOGA THERAPY RESEARCH. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO EXPLORE HOW THE SOCIAL WORK DISCIPLINE COULD PROVIDE A COMPLEMENTARY LENS THROUGH WHICH YOGA THERAPY CAN BE ANALYZED AND EVALUATED BY ENGAGING IN KNOWLEDGE-CREATION PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES THAT PRIORITIZE THE "EPISTEMIC RESPONSIBILITY" DESCRIBED BY PHILOSOPHER LORRAINE CODE. MORE SPECIFICALLY, BY SEEKING TO STRATEGICALLY INCLUDE OFTEN-SUBJUGATED TYPES OF KNOWLEDGE AND BY FOCUSING ON REDISTRIBUTING EPISTEMIC POWER TO AGENTS THAT TYPICALLY HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM EPISTEMIC PARTICIPATION IN CONTEMPORARY YOGA THERAPY RESEARCH, THE SOCIAL WORK DISCIPLINE, WITH ITS STRONG COMMITMENT TO SOCIAL JUSTICE, HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CONTRIBUTE TO FILLING AN IMPORTANT GAP IN SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE. WE BEGIN BY PRESENTING THE RELEVANCE OF THE SOCIAL WORK PERSPECTIVE IN RELATION TO THE FIELD OF YOGA THERAPY. WE NEXT OFFER A RESERVED CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE DOMINANT TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE BASE THAT CURRENTLY INFORMS YOGA THERAPY PRACTICE. THIS ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHTS THE SOCIAL PARAMETERS THAT MAY BE RENDERED INVISIBLE OR LEFT ASIDE WHEN ADOPTING A POSITIVIST EPISTEMOLOGICAL LENS AND JUSTIFIES HOW THE CONCEPTUAL APPARATUS OF EPISTEMIC RESPONSIBILITY SERVES AS A POTENTIAL PLATFORM FOR RETHINKING SOCIAL WORK'S POSITION AND FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FIELD OF YOGA THERAPY. FINALLY, WE MOBILIZE THE CONCEPT OF CULTURAL APPROPRIATION TO ILLUSTRATE HOW STRIVING FOR EPISTEMIC RESPONSIBILITY PROVIDES AN ENTRY POINT FOR ADDRESSING THE MULTILEVEL, COMPLEX SOCIAL PROCESSES EMBEDDED IN YOGA THERAPY PRACTICE AND RESEARCH WHILE AIMING TO CAPTURE THE MANY VOICES-AND HENCE THE VARIOUS TRUTHS-IMPLICATED IN A DEMOCRATIC, REFLEXIVE, AND INCLUSIVE RESEARCH PROCESS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
12 1481  21 INTEGRATING YOGA INTO PSYCHOTHERAPY: THE ETHICS OF MOVING FROM THE MIND TO THE MAT. GIVEN THE RISE IN ATTENTION TO CLIENT PREFERENCES IN MEDICAL TREATMENT AND THE SHIFT IN FOCUS TOWARD HEALTH PROMOTION, IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT THE USE OF COMPLEMENTARY HEALTH APPROACHES HAVE INCREASED IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. YOGA IS AMONG THE MOST PROMINENT COMPLEMENTARY HEALTH APPROACHES. RECENTLY, BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE WORK HAS EMERGED SUPPORTING ITS USE FOR A VARIETY OF MEDICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS. HOWEVER, THERE IS A CRITICAL GAP IN KNOWLEDGE REGARDING HOW TO MOST OPTIMALLY AND ETHICALLY INTEGRATE COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES (I.E., YOGA) INTO CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY PRACTICES. MOREOVER, IT REMAINS UNCLEAR WHICH CLIENTS ARE THE BEST CANDIDATES FOR RECEIVING SUCH COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENTS AND WHICH THERAPISTS SHOULD PROVIDE THEM. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE HISTORY OF YOGA, THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF ITS USE FOR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES, AND AN ETHICAL FRAMEWORK TO GUIDE PSYCHOLOGISTS INTERESTED IN INTEGRATING YOGA INTO PSYCHOTHERAPY.	2017

14  538  20 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT FOR NECK PAIN: CHIROPRACTIC, ACUPUNCTURE, TENS, MASSAGE, YOGA, TAI CHI, AND FELDENKRAIS. OF THE MULTITUDE OF TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF NECK PAIN, NO OBVIOUS SINGLE TREATMENT MODALITY HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE MOST EFFICACIOUS. AS SUCH, THE CLINICIAN SHOULD CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT MODALITIES IF A MODALITY IS ENGAGING, AVAILABLE, FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE, POTENTIALLY EFFICACIOUS, AND IS LOW RISK FOR THE PATIENT. AS EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE FOR NECK PAIN DEVELOPS, THE CLINICIAN IS FACED WITH THE CHALLENGE OF WHICH TREATMENTS TO ENCOURAGE PATIENTS TO PURSUE. TREATMENT MODALITIES EXPLORED IN THIS ARTICLE, INCLUDING CHIROPRACTIC, ACUPUNCTURE, TENS, MASSAGE, YOGA, TAI CHI, AND FELDENKRAIS, REPRESENT REASONABLE COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE METHODS FOR PATIENTS WITH NECK PAIN.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
15 2807  24 YOGA THERAPY RESEARCH: A WHOLE-SYSTEMS PERSPECTIVE ON COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS AND PATIENT-CENTERED OUTCOMES. FOR THE YOGA RESEARCH COMMUNITY TO CAPITALIZE ON ITS CURRENT MOMENTUM, IT IS CRITICAL TO CONSIDER CERTAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESEARCH THEORY AND INNOVATIVE METHODOLOGIES. THE CONCEPT OF MODEL VALIDITY MUST BE INCORPORATED IN YOGA THERAPY RESEARCH SO THAT EXPLANATORY CONSTRUCTS EMPLOYED AND OUTCOME MEASURES CHOSEN REFLECT THE PRINCIPLES OF TRADITIONAL YOGIC SCIENCE. FOCUSING ON EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH WILL ENSURE MAXIMUM GENERALIZABILITY OF STUDY RESULTS AND REFLECT REAL-WORLD THERAPY DELIVERY SETTINGS, THEREBY INCREASING THE RELEVANCE OF OUTCOMES. WHOLE SYSTEMS OF HEALING REQUIRE RESEARCH METHODOLOGIES THAT ADDRESS COMPLEX RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MULTI-TARGET THERAPIES WITH MULTIPLE POTENTIAL TREATMENT RESULTS. COMPLEX, DYNAMIC SYSTEMS THEORY PROVIDES THE THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS NECESSARY TO DESIGN STUDIES, CHOOSE OUTCOMES, AND ANALYZE DATA IN A WAY THAT CAN ACCOUNT FOR CHARTING COMPLEX, CYCLICAL, THERAPEUTIC TRAJECTORIES ACROSS TIME. EMPHASIZING PATIENT-CENTERED OUTCOMES IS ALIGNED WITH THE PATENT-ORIENTED AND TAILORED NATURED OF YOGA THERAPY DELIVERY. INCREASING THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH TO ANALYZE THE HARMS AND BENEFITS OF CONTRASTING THERAPIES CAN PROVIDE AN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR DESIGNING STUDIES THAT CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT PRACTICAL IMPACT. THE CREATION OF PRACTICE-BASED RESEARCH NETWORKS WITHIN THE YOGA RESEARCH COMMUNITY WILL INCENTIVIZE LINKS BETWEEN MAINSTREAM CLINICAL RESEARCHERS AND YOGA THERAPY DELIVERY SETTINGS, ULTIMATELY DEVELOPING COLLABORATIVE NETWORKS. YOGA THERAPY CENTERS CAN FACILITATE PATIENT RECRUITMENT FOR STUDIES AND INFORM STANDARDS FOR YOGA RESEARCHERS. COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS BETWEEN THE YOGA AND AYURVEDIC RESEARCH COMMUNITIES WILL STREAMLINE EFFORTS, SOLIDIFY EXPERTISE, CROSS-POLLINATE THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL INNOVATION, AND CONSOLIDATE EFFORTS TO SECURE RESEARCH FUNDING AND INCREASE PUBLICATION AND DISSEMINATION OF STUDY FINDINGS.	2015	

16  491  22 CO-DESIGNING A NEW YOGA-BASED MINDFULNESS INTERVENTION FOR SURVIVORS OF STROKE: A FORMATIVE EVALUATION. MOVEMENT-BASED MINDFULNESS INTERVENTIONS (MBI) ARE COMPLEX, MULTI-COMPONENT INTERVENTIONS FOR WHICH THE DESIGN PROCESS IS RARELY REPORTED. FOR PEOPLE WITH STROKE, EMERGING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS BENEFITS, BUT MAINSTREAM PROGRAMS ARE GENERALLY UNSUITABLE. WE AIMED TO DESCRIBE THE PROCESSES INVOLVED AND TO CONDUCT A FORMATIVE EVALUATION OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL YOGA-BASED MBI DESIGNED FOR SURVIVORS OF STROKE. WE USED THE MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL COMPLEX INTERVENTIONS FRAMEWORK AND PRINCIPLES OF CO-DESIGN. WE PURPOSEFULLY APPROACHED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND CONSUMERS TO ESTABLISH AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR DEVELOPING THE INTERVENTION. MEMBERS COLLABORATED AND ITERATIVELY REVIEWED THE DESIGN AND CONTENT OF THE PROGRAM, FORMATTED INTO A TRAINING MANUAL. FOUR EXTERNAL YOGA TEACHERS INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWED THE PROGRAM. FORMATIVE EVALUATION INCLUDED REVIEW OF MULTIPLE DATA SOURCES AND DOCUMENTATION (E.G., FORMAL MEETING MINUTES, FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS, RESEARCHER OBSERVATIONS). THE DATA WERE SYNTHESIZED USING INDUCTIVE THEMATIC ANALYSIS. THREE BROAD THEMES EMERGED: (A) MBI CONTENT AND TERMINOLOGY; (B) MANUAL DESIGN AND READABILITY; AND (C) BARRIERS AND ENABLERS TO DELIVER THE INTERVENTION. VARIOUS PERSPECTIVES AND FEEDBACK ON ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS GUIDED FINALIZING THE PROGRAM. THE DESIGN PHASE OF A NOVEL YOGA-BASED MBI WAS STRENGTHENED BY INTERDISCIPLINARY, CONSUMER CONTRIBUTIONS AND PEER REVIEW. THE 12-WEEK INTERVENTION IS READY FOR TESTING AMONG SURVIVORS OF STROKE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
17 1872  20 RAPID CONVERSION OF A GROUP-BASED YOGA TRIAL FOR DIVERSE OLDER WOMEN TO HOME-BASED TELEHEALTH: LESSONS LEARNED USING ZOOM TO DELIVER MOVEMENT-BASED INTERVENTIONS. THIS BRIEF REPORT DESCRIBES THE RAPID CONVERSION OF A RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF A HATHA-BASED YOGA PROGRAM FOR OLDER WOMEN WITH URINARY INCONTINENCE TO A TELEHEALTH VIDEOCONFERENCE PLATFORM DURING THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) PANDEMIC. INTERIM RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF RECRUITING AND RETAINING PARTICIPANTS ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF AGES AND ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS, BUT ALSO POINT TO POTENTIAL OBSTACLES AND SAFETY CONCERNS ARISING FROM TELEHEALTH-BASED INSTRUCTION. THE INVESTIGATORS PRESENT LESSONS LEARNED ABOUT THE BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES OF USING TELEHEALTH PLATFORMS TO DELIVER MOVEMENT-BASED INTERVENTIONS AND CONSIDER STRATEGIES TO PROMOTE ACCESSIBLE AND WELL-TOLERATED TELEHEALTH-BASED YOGA PROGRAMS FOR OLDER AND DIVERSE POPULATIONS.

18 2646  25 YOGA FOR YOUTH IN PAIN: THE UCLA PEDIATRIC PAIN PROGRAM MODEL. CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS, AND YOUNG ADULTS DO NOT TYPICALLY FEATURE IN CLINICS, STUDIES, AND MAINSTREAM NOTIONS OF CHRONIC PAIN. YET MANY YOUNG PEOPLE EXPERIENCE DEBILITATING PAIN FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME. CHRONIC PAIN IN THESE FORMATIVE YEARS MAY BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO TREAT IN ORDER FOR YOUNG PATIENTS TO MAINTAIN LIFE TASKS AND TO PREVENT PROTRACTED DISABILITY. THE PEDIATRIC PAIN PROGRAM AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES, IS A MULTIDISCIPLINARY TREATMENT PROGRAM DESIGNED FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN AND THEIR FAMILIES. WE OFFER BOTH CONVENTIONAL AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE TO TREAT THE WHOLE INDIVIDUAL. THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE WORK UNDERTAKEN IN THE CLINIC AND OUR NEWLY DEVELOPED YOGA FOR YOUTH RESEARCH PROGRAM. THE CLINICAL AND RESEARCH PROGRAMS FILL A CRITICAL NEED TO PROVIDE SERVICE TO YOUTH WITH CHRONIC PAIN AND TO SCIENTIFICALLY STUDY ONE OF THE MORE POPULAR COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENTS WE OFFER, IYENGAR YOGA.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
19  381  22 BEING ALONE TOGETHER: YOGA, BODYWORK, AND INTIMATE SOCIALITY IN AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS. USING ETHNOGRAPHIC DATA FROM PROVIDENCE COUNTY, RHODE ISLAND, THIS PAPER EXPLORES YOGA AS A BODYWORK PRACTICE THAT IS PART OF EVERYDAY HEALTH AND WELLBEING ROUTINES IN MIDDLE CLASS HOUSEHOLDS. IN THIS CONTEXT, PARTICIPANTS DEFINE THEIR BODYWORK PRACTICES AS INDIVIDUAL ACTIVITIES THAT ANSWER HEALTH AND WELLBEING NEEDS, BUT NOTABLY DISCUSS BODYWORK IN TERMS OF THEIR EVERYDAY SOCIAL EXPERIENCE. ALONG WITH OTHER BODYWORK ACTIVITIES, YOGA EMERGES AS A SHARED SOCIAL PRACTICE THAT LINKS PARTICIPANTS TO THEIR PARTNERS, CHILDREN, AND OTHER INTIMATES, FACILITATING A SENSE OF TOGETHERNESS BY ALLOWING TIME AND SPACE FOR AUTONOMY. BY GIVING ATMOSPHERIC AND SENSORY ATTENTION TO THE ETHNOGRAPHIC DATA, THE PAPER FURTHER REVEALS HOW DOMESTIC INTIMACY IS CULTIVATED VIA THE GENERATION OF BODILY HEAT AND POSITIVE ENERGIES AND THAT YOGA MAY TACITLY FACILITATE SUCH ATMOSPHERES. IN THIS WAY, YOGA CAN HELP HOUSEHOLDS MEET AN AMERICAN NEED FOR SELF-DEVELOPMENT AND AUTONOMY WHILE STILL FACILITATING A FAR MORE ENDURING HUMAN NEED FOR INTIMATE CONNECTION. ULTIMATELY YOGA IS CHARACTERIZED AS A PRAGMATIC BODYWORK PRACTICE THAT BLENDS SELF-DEVELOPMENT AND SOCIAL INTIMACY THROUGH SHARED ENERGETIC ENCOUNTERS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
20 2709  25 YOGA IS FOR EVERY (ABLE) BODY: A CONTENT ANALYSIS OF DISABILITY THEMES WITHIN MAINSTREAM YOGA MEDIA. YOGA IS INCREASINGLY BEING RECOMMENDED AS A HEALTH SELF-MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR PEOPLE WITH A RANGE OF DISABILITIES. MAINSTREAM YOGA MEDIA HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED FOR LIMITED REPRESENTATION OF RACIAL/ETHNIC, GENDER, AGE, AND BODY SIZE DIVERSITY WITHIN THEIR PUBLICATIONS; HOWEVER, IT IS NOT KNOWN HOW THESE MEDIA OUTLETS INCLUDE VISUAL REPRESENTATIONS OF OR TEXTUAL INFORMATION RELEVANT FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES (PWDS). THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO UNDERSTAND IF AND HOW MAINSTREAM YOGA MEDIA VISUALLY REPRESENT AND INCLUDE INFORMATION FOR PWDS. WE CONDUCTED A CONTENT ANALYSIS OF THE "YOGAPEDIA" SECTION OF EACH YOGA JOURNAL MAGAZINE PUBLISHED IN 2015 AND 2016 (N = 17). TWO INDEPENDENT CODERS RATED ALL OF THE IMAGES AND TEXT IN THESE SECTIONS. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING A THEMATIC APPROACH INFORMED BY A PROMINENT THEORETICAL MODEL OF DISABLEMENT. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT IMAGES CONTAINED NO REPRESENTATION OF DISABILITY. IN CONTRAST, MAGAZINE TEXT INCLUDED AN ABUNDANCE OF REFERENCES TO DISABILITY; HOWEVER, THESE MENTIONS PREDOMINATELY ALIGNED WITH CONSTRUCTS FOUND EARLY IN THE DISABLEMENT PROCESS AND STRONGLY FOCUSED ON PHYSICAL AND MOBILITY LIMITATIONS. THESE FINDINGS EXPAND UPON PREVIOUS RESEARCH EXAMINING THE UNDERREPRESENTATION OF MARGINALIZED GROUPS WITHIN YOGA MEDIA AND ILLUMINATE A PAUCITY OF RELEVANT INFORMATION FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES WHO ARE INTERESTED IN AND MAY BENEFIT FROM YOGA PRACTICE.	2019

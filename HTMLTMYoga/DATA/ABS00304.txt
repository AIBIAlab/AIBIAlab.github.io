1  304 120 AN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF YOGA-RELATED INJURY PRESENTATIONS TO EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS IN AUSTRALIA. OBJECTIVES: DESPITE BEING CONSIDERED A LOW-INTENSITY EXERCISE, CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT THE RISK OF INJURIES ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA. THIS STUDY AIMED TO ANALYZE THE CHARACTERISTICS AND TREND OF YOGA-RELATED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) PRESENTATIONS FROM JULY 2009 TO JUNE 2016 IN VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA. METHODS: THE VICTORIAN EMERGENCY MINIMUM DATASET (VEMD) WAS USED TO COLLECT THE DE-IDENTIFIED DATA. THE DATA WERE FIRST ANALYZED USING DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS AND SPEARMAN'S CORRELATION. FURTHER INJURY TREND WAS ANALYZED BY CALCULATING THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE OF THE NUMBER OF YOGA-RELATED INJURIES DURING THE 7-YEAR STUDY PERIOD. RESULTS: THERE WERE 118 YOGA-RELATED INJURY CASES THAT SIGNIFICANTLY (P < .05) INCREASED BY 357% FROM JULY 2009 TO JUNE 2016. MOST OF THE CASES WERE FEMALE (N = 96; 81.4%) AND BETWEEN 20 AND 39 YEARS OLD (N = 68, 57.6%). MOST COMMON INJURIES COMPRISED DISLOCATIONS/SPRAINS/STRAINS (N = 60, 51.7%) FOLLOWED BY FRACTURES (N = 17, 14.4%), AND INJURY TO MUSCLE/TENDON (N = 15, 12.7%). CONCLUSION: THE FINDINGS WARRANT FUTURE NATIONWIDE RESEARCH AS WELL AS AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES OF YOGA SERVICE PROVIDERS TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF INJURY.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
2 2876  40 YOGA-RELATED INJURIES IN THE UNITED STATES FROM 2001 TO 2014. BACKGROUND: YOGA HAS BECOME MORE POPULAR AMONG PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES AND HAS BEEN TOUTED BY BOTH YOGA PARTICIPANTS AS WELL AS SOME PHYSICIANS AND RESEARCHERS FOR ITS HEALTH BENEFITS. WHILE THE HEALTH BENEFITS HAVE BEEN STUDIED, THE FREQUENCY OF INJURY AMONG YOGA PARTICIPANTS HAS NOT BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED. PURPOSE: INJURY INCIDENCE, RATES, AND TYPES ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE NOT BEEN QUANTIFIED. THIS STUDY ESTIMATES US YOGA-ASSOCIATED INJURY INCIDENCE AND CHARACTERIZES INJURY TYPE OVER A 13-YEAR PERIOD. STUDY DESIGN: DESCRIPTIVE EPIDEMIOLOGY STUDY. METHODS: DATA FROM THE NATIONAL ELECTRONIC INJURY SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM (NEISS) FROM 2001 TO 2014 WERE USED TO ESTIMATE THE INCIDENCE AND TYPE OF YOGA-ASSOCIATED INJURIES. THE NUMBER AND AGE DISTRIBUTION OF YOGA PARTICIPANTS WAS ESTIMATED USING DATA FROM NATIONAL HEALTH STATISTICS REPORTS. THESE NATIONAL POPULATION ESTIMATES WERE APPLIED TO THE NEISS DATA TO DETERMINE INJURY RATES OVERALL AND STRATIFIED ACCORDING TO AGE CATEGORIES. RESULTS: THERE WERE 29,590 YOGA-RELATED INJURIES SEEN IN HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS FROM 2001 TO 2014. THE TRUNK (46.6%) WAS THE MOST FREQUENT REGION INJURED, AND SPRAIN/STRAIN (45.0%) ACCOUNTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF DIAGNOSES. THE INJURY RATE INCREASED OVERALL FROM 2001 TO 2014, AND IT WAS GREATEST FOR THOSE AGED 65 YEARS AND OLDER (57.9/100,000) COMPARED WITH THOSE AGED 18 TO 44 YEARS (11.9/100,000) AND 45 TO 64 YEARS (17.7/100,000) IN 2014. CONCLUSION: PARTICIPANTS AGED 65 YEARS AND OLDER HAVE A GREATER RATE OF INJURY FROM PRACTICING YOGA WHEN COMPARED WITH OTHER AGE GROUPS. MOST INJURIES SUSTAINED WERE TO THE TRUNK AND INVOLVED A SPRAIN/STRAIN. WHILE THERE ARE MANY HEALTH BENEFITS TO PRACTICING YOGA, PARTICIPANTS AND THOSE WISHING TO BECOME PARTICIPANTS SHOULD CONFER WITH A PHYSICIAN PRIOR TO ENGAGING IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND PRACTICE ONLY UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF CERTIFIED INSTRUCTORS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
3 1157  32 EPIDEMIOLOGY OF YOGA-RELATED INJURIES IN CANADA FROM 1991 TO 2010: A CASE SERIES STUDY. THE AIM IS TO DESCRIBE THE EPIDEMIOLOGY OF YOGA INJURIES PRESENTING TO SELECT CANADIAN EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS (EDS). THOSE WHO PRESENTED WITH A YOGA INJURY TO A CANADIAN ED PARTICIPATING IN THE CANADIAN HOSPITALS INJURY REPORTING AND PREVENTION PROGRAM AND HAD COMPLETED A DATA COLLECTION FORM BETWEEN 1991 AND 2010 WERE INCLUDED. DEMOGRAPHIC AND INJURY CHARACTERISTICS WERE TABULATED AND INJURY PROFILES OF CHILDREN WERE COMPARED TO ADULTS. SIXTY-SIX INDIVIDUALS (48 FEMALE, 18 MALE) WHO SUSTAINED 67 INJURIES WERE INCLUDED. THE MEDIAN AGE WAS 19 (INTRAQUARTILE RANGE: 13, 32) AND 73% OF INDIVIDUALS WERE INJURED AFTER 2005 (P = 0.0003). SPRAIN WAS THE MOST COMMON INJURY (23/67, 34%) AND THE MOST COMMON BODY REGION INJURED WAS THE LOWER EXTREMITY (27/67, 42%). SIGNIFICANTLY MORE CHILDREN WERE INJURED WHILE BEING INSTRUCTED THAN ADULTS (P = 0.003) BUT MORE ADULTS REQUIRED TREATMENT (P = 0.023). ALTHOUGH YOGA-RELATED INJURIES PRESENTING TO AN ED ARE NOT COMMON, THE NUMBER OF INJURIES ARE INCREASING.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
4  639  26 DO SIDE-EFFECTS/INJURIES FROM YOGA PRACTICE RESULT IN DISCONTINUED USE? RESULTS OF A NATIONAL SURVEY. CONTEXT: YOGA-RELATED INJURIES ARE OF INCREASING CONCERN AS THE USE OF YOGA CONTINUES TO RISE. AIMS: THE AIM OF THE FOLLOWING STUDY IS TO EXAMINE WHETHER A NATIONAL SAMPLE OF YOGA PRACTITIONERS WOULD REPORT DISCONTINUED USE OF YOGA DUE TO INJURY FROM THE PRACTICE, ASSESS WHAT INJURIES RESULTED IN DISCONTINUED USE, DETERMINE WHAT INJURIES WERE MOST COMMON AND IDENTIFY INJURIES REQUIRING MEDICAL ATTENTION. METHODS: SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS OF A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF ADULTS IN THE UNITED STATES (N = 23,393). RESULTS: LESS THAN 1% OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD EVER PRACTICED YOGA (N = 2230) REPORTED AN INJURY FROM YOGA THAT LED TO DISCONTINUED USE. OF THOSE REPORTING INJURY, LESS THAN ONE-THIRD (N = 4) REPORTED SEEKING MEDICAL ATTENTION. THE MOST COMMON SIDE-EFFECT WAS BACK PAIN. APPROXIMATELY, HALF OF THOSE REPORTING BACK PAIN SOUGHT MEDICAL ATTENTION. CONCLUSIONS: INJURY DUE TO YOGA IS AN INFREQUENT BARRIER TO CONTINUED PRACTICE AND SEVERE INJURY DUE TO YOGA IS RARE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
5  386  29 BENEFITS AND ADVERSE EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA PRACTICE: A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY FROM INDIA. OBJECTIVE: BENEFITS AND ADVERSE EFFECTS OF YOGA WERE REPORTED IN SURVEYS FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO (I) DETERMINE THE BENEFITS AND ADVERSE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN YOGA EXPERIENCED PERSONS IN INDIA AND (II) CORRELATE THESE EFFECTS OF YOGA WITH FACTORS RELATED TO THE INDIVIDUAL AND THEIR YOGA PRACTICE. DESIGN AND SETTING: THIS CONVENIENCE SAMPLING IN-PERSON SURVEY REPORTS BENEFITS AND ADVERSE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN 3135 YOGA EXPERIENCED PERSONS. RESULTS: THE BENEFITS OF YOGA WERE REPORTED BY 94.5 PERCENT OF THE RESPONDENTS. THE THREE MOST COMMON BENEFITS WERE IMPROVEMENT IN: (I) PHYSICAL FITNESS, (II) MENTAL STATE AND (III) COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS. AN ADVERSE EFFECT OF YOGA WAS REPORTED BY 1.9 PERCENT OF THE RESPONDENTS. THE THREE MOST COMMON ADVERSE EFFECTS REPORTED WERE: (I) SORENESS AND PAIN, (II) MUSCLE INJURIES AND (III) FATIGUE. THE FOLLOWING FACTORS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION (IN ALL CASES P < 0.05 CHI SQUARE TEST; CRAMER'S V > 0.10) WITH REPORTED BENEFITS OF YOGA: (I) EXPERIENCE OF YOGA IN MONTHS, (II) TIME SPENT PRACTICING YOGA IN A WEEK, (III) NUMBER OF YOGA TECHNIQUES PRACTICED, AND (IV) WHETHER AWARENESS WAS MAINTAINED DURING THE YOGA PRACTICE OR NOT. CONCLUSION: BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE TO PHYSICAL HEALTH WERE THE MOST COMMON, WITH SORENESS AND PAIN THE MOST COMMON ADVERSE EFFECT OF YOGA. YOGA PRACTICE RELATED FACTORS INFLUENCE THE BENEFITS OF YOGA.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
6  469  31 CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA AND MEDITATION USERS AMONG OLDER AUSTRALIAN WOMEN - RESULTS FROM THE 45 AND UP STUDY. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: YOGA AND MEDITATION ARE PREDOMINANTLY UTILISED BY HEALTHY WELL-EDUCATED YOUNG WOMEN, BUT LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT UTILISATION BY OLDER CHRONICALLY ILL WOMEN. THEREFORE, THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA AND MEDITATION USE AMONG MIDDLE-TO-HIGHER AGED AUSTRALIAN WOMEN WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS IS A SUB-STUDY OF THE 45 AND UP STUDY INCLUDING 1925 AUSTRALIAN WOMEN AGED 53-95 YEARS DIAGNOSED WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS (ASTHMA, DEPRESSION, DIABETES, OSTEOARTHRITIS, AND OSTEOPOROSIS). INFORMATION ON YOGA AND MEDITATION USE FREQUENCIES (CATEGORIES: 'NO YOGA', 'AT LEAST ONCE DAILY', 'AT LEAST ONCE WEEKLY', AND 'AT LEAST ONCE MONTHLY'), SELF-PERCEIVED EFFECTIVENESS AND COMMUNICATION WITH HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WERE ASSESSED VIA SELF-REPORT. LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY INDEPENDENT PREDICTORS OF YOGA AND MEDITATION USE, USING SPSS 24.0. RESULTS: OVERALL 6.8% AND 10.7% OF WOMEN REPORTED THE USE OF YOGA AND MEDITATION RESPECTIVELY. MEDITATION WAS RARELY PRACTICED SUPERVISED (11.7%), COMPARED TO SIGNIFICANT HIGHER RATES IN YOGA (53.2%). PREDICTORS FOR YOGA AND MEDITATION USE WERE MARITAL STATUS (MARRIED/IN RELATIONSHIP>NOT MARRIED/IN RELATIONSHIP), HIGHER HEALTH RELATED HARDINESS, AND HIGHER EDUCATION, WHEREAS OBESITY, AND DIABETES DECREASED LIKELIHOOD OF USE. WHILE THE MAJORITY FOUND YOGA AND MEDITATION HELPFUL FOR THEIR CONDITION, THE USE WAS RARELY MONITORED BY OR DISCUSSED WITH HEALTH CARE PRACTITIONERS. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY FINDS THAT YOGA AND MEDITATION ARE USED BY MIDDLE-TO-HIGHER AGED AUSTRALIAN WOMEN WITH CHRONIC ILLNESSES. THE LACK OF COMMUNICATION WITH HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS IS CONCERNING AND MIGHT HINDER COORDINATED AND EFFECTIVE HEALTH CARE AROUND CHRONIC ILLNESS. FURTHER RESEARCH IS NECESSARY TO HELP UNDERSTAND POSSIBLE CONCURRENT HEALTH CARE USE AND THEREBY HELP INFORM SAFE, EFFECTIVE AND COORDINATE HEALTH SEEKING AMONGST THOSE WITH CHRONIC ILLNESS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
7 2661  30 YOGA IN AUSTRALIA: RESULTS OF A NATIONAL SURVEY. INTRODUCTION: THE THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS OF YOGA AND MEDITATION ARE WELL DOCUMENTED, YET LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE PRACTICE OF YOGA IN AUSTRALIA OR ELSEWHERE, WHETHER AS A PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, A FORM OF THERAPY, A SPIRITUAL PATH OR A LIFESTYLE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TO INVESTIGATE THE PRACTICE OF YOGA IN AUSTRALIA, A NATIONAL SURVEY OF YOGA PRACTITIONERS WAS CONDUCTED UTILIZING A COMPREHENSIVE WEB-BASED QUESTIONNAIRE. RESPONDENTS WERE SELF-SELECTING TO PARTICIPATE. A TOTAL OF 3,892 RESPONDENTS COMPLETED THE SURVEY. SIXTY OVERSEAS RESPONDENTS AND 1265 YOGA TEACHERS (TO BE REPORTED SEPARATELY) WERE EXCLUDED, LEAVING 2,567 YOGA PRACTITIONER RESPONDENTS. RESULTS: THE TYPICAL YOGA SURVEY RESPONDENT WAS A 41-YEAR-OLD, TERTIARY EDUCATED, EMPLOYED, HEALTH-CONSCIOUS FEMALE (85% WOMEN). ASANA (POSTURES) AND VINYASA (SEQUENCES OF POSTURES) REPRESENTED 61% OF THE TIME SPENT PRACTICING, WITH THE OTHER 39% DEVOTED TO THE GENTLER PRACTICES OF RELAXATION, PRANAYAMA (BREATHING TECHNIQUES), MEDITATION AND INSTRUCTION. RESPONDENTS COMMONLY STARTED PRACTICING YOGA FOR HEALTH AND FITNESS BUT OFTEN CONTINUED PRACTICING FOR STRESS MANAGEMENT. ONE IN FIVE RESPONDENTS PRACTICED YOGA FOR A SPECIFIC HEALTH OR MEDICAL REASON WHICH WAS SEEN TO BE IMPROVED BY YOGA PRACTICE. OF THESE, MORE PEOPLE USED YOGA FOR STRESS MANAGEMENT AND ANXIETY THAN BACK, NECK OR SHOULDER PROBLEMS, SUGGESTING THAT MENTAL HEALTH MAY BE THE PRIMARY HEALTH-RELATED MOTIVATION FOR PRACTICING YOGA. HEALTHY LIFESTYLE CHOICES WERE SEEN TO BE MORE PREVALENT IN RESPONDENTS WITH MORE YEARS OF PRACTICE. YOGA-RELATED INJURIES OCCURRING UNDER SUPERVISION IN THE PREVIOUS 12 MONTHS WERE LOW AT 2.4% OF RESPONDENTS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA PRACTICE WAS SEEN TO ASSIST IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SPECIFIC HEALTH ISSUES AND MEDICAL CONDITIONS. REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE MAY ALSO EXERT A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE EFFECT INCLUDING VEGETARIANISM, NON-SMOKING, REDUCED ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION, INCREASED EXERCISE AND REDUCED STRESS WITH RESULTING COST BENEFITS TO THE COMMUNITY.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
8 1507  34 IS A YOGA-BASED PROGRAM WITH POTENTIAL TO DECREASE FALLS PERCEIVED TO BE ACCEPTABLE TO COMMUNITY-DWELLING PEOPLE OLDER THAN 60? OBJECTIVES AND IMPORTANCE OF STUDY: YOGA IMPROVES BALANCE AND MOBILITY, AND THEREFORE HAS POTENTIAL AS A FALL PREVENTION STRATEGY, YET ITS VALIDITY FOR PREVENTING FALLS HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED. THE OTAGO EXERCISE PROGRAMME (OEP) AND TAI CHI ARE PROVEN TO PREVENT FALLS. THIS STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE THE PERCEPTIONS AND PREFERENCES OF OLDER PEOPLE TOWARDS A YOGA-BASED PROGRAM WITH POTENTIAL TO DECREASE FALLS, TO COMPARE THESE PERCEPTIONS TO THE VIEWS EXPRESSED ABOUT THE OEP AND TAI CHI, AND TO IDENTIFY PARTICIPANT CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH A PREFERENCE FOR THE YOGA PROGRAM. STUDY TYPE: SURVEY. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE 235 COMMUNITY-DWELLERS AGED 60 YEARS OR OLDER WHO WERE NOT PARTICIPATING OR HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY PARTICIPATED (WITHIN THE PAST 10 YEARS) IN YOGA-BASED EXERCISE. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED A SELF-REPORT SURVEY MEASURING DEMOGRAPHICS, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY LEVEL AND ATTITUDE. THEY THEN VIEWED EXPLANATIONS OF THE YOGA-BASED PROGRAM, THE OEP AND TAI CHI. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE ATTITUDES TO FALLS-RELATED INTERVENTIONS SCALE (AFRIS) TO MEASURE PROGRAM ACCEPTABILITY AND IDENTIFIED THEIR PREFERRED PROGRAM. ACCEPTABILITY SCORES AND PREFERENCE WERE COMPARED BETWEEN THE PROGRAMS, AND FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA PREFERENCE WERE IDENTIFIED WITH ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE. RESULTS: THE MEAN AGE OF PARTICIPANTS (69% FEMALE) WAS 69.4 YEARS (STANDARD DEVIATION 7.4). ALL PROGRAMS WERE RATED AS EQUALLY ACCEPTABLE (P = 0.17), WITH AFRIS SCORES RANGING FROM 28.1 TO 29.4. EIGHTY-TWO PEOPLE (35%) PREFERRED YOGA, 32% CHOSE THE OEP AND 33% CHOSE TAI CHI. OVERALL, PEOPLE WHO PREFERRED YOGA WERE SIGNIFICANTLY YOUNGER, HEALTHIER, LESS FEARFUL OF FALLING, AND PERCEIVED EXERCISE MORE POSITIVELY THAN PEOPLE WHO PREFERRED THE OEP (P VALUES RANGED FROM 0.03 TO <0.001). THE CHARACTERISTICS OF PEOPLE WHO PREFERRED YOGA AND THOSE WHO PREFERRED TAI CHI DID NOT VARY SIGNIFICANTLY. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA WAS PERCEIVED TO BE APPROPRIATE AND WAS AS POPULAR AS TWO VALIDATED FALL PREVENTION PROGRAMS. YOGA WARRANTS FURTHER INVESTIGATION AS A FALL PREVENTION STRATEGY, PARTICULARLY FOR 'YOUNGER' AND HEALTHIER PEOPLE AGED 60 YEARS OR OLDER.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                       
9 1315  33 HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES WITH REGULAR YOGA AND HEARTFULNESS MEDITATION PRACTICE: RESULTS FROM A MULTINATIONAL, CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY. BACKGROUND: ALTHOUGH THE BENEFITS OF YOGA ARE WELL ESTABLISHED ACROSS THE WORLD, THERE ARE LIMITED STUDIES EXPLORING THE LONG-TERM INTERRELATION BETWEEN YOGA, MEDITATION, AND HEALTH. SPECIFICALLY, THERE IS LIMITED RESEARCH EXPLORING THE DIFFERENCES IN HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) AMONG REGULAR MEDITATORS AND NONMEDITATORS. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY EXPLORED THE DIFFERENCES IN 7 DOMAINS OF HRQOL (INCLUDING QUALITY OF LIFE, ABILITY TO ADOPT A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE, ABILITY TO RELAX, FREQUENCY OF NERVOUSNESS AND STRESS, COPING WITH DAY-TO-DAY STRESS, WORKPLACE PRODUCTIVITY, AND STAYING HEALTHY DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC) AMONG PRACTITIONERS OF YOGA AND MEDITATION. METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL, ONLINE SURVEY WAS DISTRIBUTED TO ALL MEMBERS WHO PARTICIPATED IN A 100-DAY YOGA AND MEDITATION PROGRAM, CULMINATING IN THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF YOGA EVENT, ORGANIZED BY THE HEARTFULNESS INSTITUTE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CENTRAL COUNCIL FOR RESEARCH IN YOGA AND NATUROPATHY, MINISTRY OF AYUSH, SVYASA YOGA UNIVERSITY, AND PATANJALI YOGA INSTITUTE, INDIA. THE PROGRAM CONSISTED OF DAILY VIRTUAL YOGA, MEDITATION, AND SPEAKER SESSIONS. THE DATA WERE ANALYZED BY NONPARAMETRIC MANN-WHITNEY U TEST AND KRUSKAL-WALLIS TESTS FOR CONTINUOUS VARIABLES AND CHI-SQUARE TEST FOR CATEGORICAL VARIABLES. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 3164 PARTICIPANTS FROM 39 COUNTRIES COMPLETED THE SURVEY. MEAN AGE WAS 33.8 (SD 13.6) YEARS. THE MAJORITY OF THE PARTICIPANTS WERE FEMALE (N=1643, 52%) AND STUDENTS (N=1312, 41.5%). REGULAR YOGA AND MEDITATION PRACTICE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A POSITIVE IMPACT ON ALL 7 DOMAINS OF HRQOL (MANN-WHITNEY P<.05 AND CHI(2)P<.05). NOTABLY, EXPERIENCED HEARTFULNESS (>/=2 YEARS) MEDITATORS REPORTED BETTER OUTCOMES IN ALL THE DOMAINS OF HRQOL AS COMPARED TO THOSE NOT CURRENTLY PRACTICING THIS FORM OF MEDITATION AND PARTICIPANTS WITH </=1 YEAR OF HEARTFULNESS MEDITATION EXPERIENCE (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDIES TO EXPLORE HRQOL OUTCOMES AMONG PARTICIPANTS OF A 100-DAY VIRTUAL YOGA AND MEDITATION PROGRAM. OVERALL, A YOGA AND MEDITATION PRACTICE WAS FOUND TO BE AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR PROMOTING HRQOL. REGULAR YOGA AND MEDITATION PRACTICE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH FACTORS PROMOTING HEALTH AND WELL-BEING, WITH LONG-TERM MEDITATION PRACTICE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED BENEFITS.	2022	

10 2751  30 YOGA PRACTICE IS ASSOCIATED WITH ATTENUATED WEIGHT GAIN IN HEALTHY, MIDDLE-AGED MEN AND WOMEN. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS PROMOTED OR WEIGHT MAINTENANCE, BUT THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE OF ITS EFFICACY. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE WHETHER YOGA PRACTICE IS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER MEAN 10-YEAR WEIGHT GAIN AFTER AGE 45. PARTICIPANTS: PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED 15,550 ADULTS, AGED 53 TO 57 YEARS, RECRUITED TO THE VITAMIN AND LIFESTYLE (VITAL) COHORT STUDY BETWEEN 2000 AND 2002. MEASUREMENTS: PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (INCLUDING YOGA) DURING THE PAST 10 YEARS, DIET, HEIGHT, AND WEIGHT AT RECRUITMENT AND AT AGES 30 AND 45. ALL MEASURES WERE BASED ON SELF-REPORTING, AND PAST WEIGHT WAS RETROSPECTIVELY ASCERTAINED. METHODS: MULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSES WERE USED TO EXAMINED COVARIATE-ADJUSTED ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN YOGA PRACTICE AND WEIGHT CHANGE FROM AGE 45 TO RECRUITMENT, AND POLYCHOTOMOUS LOGISTIC REGRESSION WAS USED TO EXAMINE ASSOCIATIONS OF YOGA PRACTICE WITH THE RELATIVE ODDS OF WEIGHT MAINTENANCE (WITHIN 5%) AND WEIGHT LOSS (> 5%) COMPARED TO WEIGHT GAIN. RESULTS: YOGA PRACTICE FOR FOUR OR MORE YEARS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A 3.1-LB LOWER WEIGHT GAIN AMONG NORMAL WEIGHT (BMI < 25) PARTICIPANTS [9.5 LBS VERSUS 12.6 IBS] AND AN 18.5-LB LOWER WEIGHT GAIN AMONG OVERWEIGHT PARTICIPANTS [-5.0 LBS VERSUS 13.5 IBS] (BOTH P FOR TREND <.001). AMONG OVERWEIGHT INDIVIDUALS, 4+ YEARS OF YOGA PRACTICE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A RELATIVE ODDS OF 1.85 (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI] 0.63-5.42) FOR WEIGHT MAINTENANCE (WITHIN 5%) AND 3.88 (95% CL 1.30-9.88) FOR WEIGHT LOSS (> 5%) COMPARED TO WEIGHT GAIN (P FOR TREND .026 AND .003, RESPECTIVELY). CONCLUSIONS: REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH ATTENUATED WEIGHT GAIN, MOST STRONGLY AMONG INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE OVERWEIGHT. ALTHOUGH CAUSAL INFERENCE FROM THIS OBSERVATIONAL STUDY IS NOT POSSIBLE, RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE HYPOTHESIS THAT REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE CAN BENEFIT INDIVIDUALS WHO WISH TO MAINTAIN OR LOSE WEIGHT.	2005	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
11  471  32 CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA PRACTITIONERS, MOTIVATORS, AND YOGA TECHNIQUES OF CHOICE: A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY. BACKGROUND: THE CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND FACTORS MOTIVATING PEOPLE TO PRACTICE YOGA HAVE BEEN STUDIED IN THE US AND IN AUSTRALIA. THIS STUDY AIMED TO DETERMINE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA USERS IN INDIA, THE FACTORS THAT MOTIVATE THEM TO PRACTICE YOGA, AND THE YOGA TECHNIQUES OF CHOICE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE STUDY WAS A ONE-TIME, CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY BASED ON CONVENIENCE SAMPLING. INCLUSION CRITERIA WERE (A) A MINIMUM OF 1 WEEK EXPERIENCE OF YOGA AND (B) AT LEAST 10 YEARS OF AGE. 14,250 PEOPLE RECEIVED THE SURVEY. AFTER EXCLUDING THOSE WHO DID NOT MEET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA OR FILLED IN THE SURVEY INCOMPLETELY OR INCORRECTLY, 5,157 RESPONDENTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. RESULTS: OUT OF 5,157 RESPONDENTS, THERE WERE MORE MALES (67.3%), AGED BETWEEN 21 AND 44 YEARS (33.7% OF THE SAMPLE SURVEYED), EDUCATED UP TO HIGH SCHOOL (62.5%), STUDENTS (39.3%), AND THOSE WHO HAD BETWEEN 1 AND 12 MONTHS OF EXPERIENCE IN YOGA (54.4%). THE FIRST MOST COMMON REASON TO PRACTICE YOGA FOR ALL RESPONDENTS WAS PHYSICAL FITNESS. THREE OF THE REMAINING REASONS TO PRACTICE YOGA DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH AGE: (I) YOGA FOR DISEASE MANAGEMENT (CHI(2) = 17.62, P < 0.005), (II) YOGA AS A HOBBY (CHI(2) = 10.87, P < 0.05), AND (III) YOGA BASED ON THE GURU'S (TEACHER'S) INSTRUCTIONS (CHI(2) = 20.05, P < 0.001). THE YOGA TECHNIQUE OF CHOICE [I.E., (I) ASANAS (CHI(2) = 23.17, P < 0.001), (II) PRANAYAMA (CHI(2) = 19.87, P < 0.001), OR (III) MEDITATION (CHI(2) = 9.64, P < 0.05)] DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY ACROSS AGE GROUPS. CONCLUSION: IN INDIA, A YOGA PRACTITIONER WAS MORE LIKELY TO BE MALE, BETWEEN 21 AND 44 YEARS OF AGE, HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATED, AND A STUDENT. THE REASONS TO PRACTICE YOGA AND THE YOGA TECHNIQUE OF CHOICE DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH AGE.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
12 1807  27 PREVALENCE, PATTERNS, AND PREDICTORS OF YOGA USE: RESULTS OF A U.S. NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SURVEY. INTRODUCTION: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE PREVALENCE, PATTERNS, AND PREDICTORS OF YOGA USE IN THE U.S. GENERAL POPULATION. METHODS: USING CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA FROM THE 2012 NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY FAMILY CORE, SAMPLE ADULT CORE, AND ADULT COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE QUESTIONNAIRES (N=34,525), WEIGHTED FREQUENCIES FOR LIFETIME AND 12-MONTH PREVALENCE OF YOGA USE AND PATTERNS OF YOGA PRACTICE WERE ANALYZED. USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSES, SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC PREDICTORS OF LIFETIME YOGA USE WERE ANALYZED. ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED IN 2015. RESULTS: LIFETIME AND 12-MONTH PREVALENCE OF YOGA USE WERE 13.2% AND 8.9%, RESPECTIVELY. COMPARED WITH NONPRACTITIONERS, LIFETIME YOGA PRACTITIONERS WERE MORE LIKELY FEMALE, YOUNGER, NON-HISPANIC WHITE, COLLEGE EDUCATED, HIGHER EARNERS, LIVING IN THE WEST, AND OF BETTER HEALTH STATUS. AMONG THOSE WHO HAD PRACTICED IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS, 51.2% ATTENDED YOGA CLASSES, 89.9% USED BREATHING EXERCISES, AND 54.9% USED MEDITATION. YOGA WAS PRACTICED FOR GENERAL WELLNESS OR DISEASE PREVENTION (78.4%), TO IMPROVE ENERGY (66.1%), OR TO IMPROVE IMMUNE FUNCTION (49.7%). BACK PAIN (19.7%), STRESS (6.4%), AND ARTHRITIS (6.4%) WERE THE MAIN SPECIFIC HEALTH PROBLEMS FOR WHICH PEOPLE PRACTICED YOGA. CONCLUSIONS: ABOUT 31 MILLION U.S. ADULTS HAVE EVER USED YOGA, AND ABOUT 21 MILLION PRACTICED YOGA IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS. DISEASE PREVENTION AND BACK PAIN RELIEF WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT HEALTH REASONS FOR YOGA PRACTICE. YOGA PRACTICE IS ASSOCIATED WITH AGE, GENDER, ETHNICITY, SES, AND HEALTH STATUS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
13 1719  37 PERCEIVED USEFULNESS OF YOGA TO MAINTAIN WELL-BEING AND IN RELATION TO COVID-19 CASES AMONG HUNGARIAN YOGA PRACTITIONERS. BACKGROUND: THE PRESENT COVID-19 EPIDEMIC HAS HAD A CONSIDERABLE IMPACT ON THE MENTAL HEALTH OF INDIVIDUALS WORLDWIDE. RESEARCH PROJECTS SUGGESTS POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE FOR PREVENTION, OR AS MEDICAL SUPPLEMENTATION IN RELATION TO THE PRESENT PANDEMIC. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN YOGA AND HEALTH STATUS, AND HOW THE FREQUENCY OF YOGA PRACTICE AFFECTED THE MENTAL WELL-BEING (MWB) OF THE RESPONDENTS. METHODS: HUNGARIAN YOGA PRACTITIONERS (N=379) AGED 20 TO 75 YEARS (93.4% FEMALE) WERE ASKED ABOUT THEIR PERSONAL HEALTH, PERCEIVED USEFULNESS OF YOGA PRACTICE FOR COVID-19 CASES AND THEIR MWB. DATA WERE COLLECTED BETWEEN APRIL 17 AND MAY 17, 2021. THE MEASUREMENT TOOL USED WAS AN ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRE INCLUDING SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC DATA, CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA PRACTICE, COVID-19 AND HEALTH RELATED QUESTIONS, AND WHO WELL-BEING INDEX (WBI-5). ASSOCIATIONS WERE EXAMINED THROUGH ANOVA AND CHI-SQUARE TESTS. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE AMONG THE YOGA PRACTICE GROUPS BY WEEKLY FREQUENCY (ONCE A WEEK, 2-3 TIMES A WEEK, 4-5 TIMES A WEEK, DAILY) ON THE TOTAL MEAN SCORE OF WELL-BEING (WBI-5), F (3, 373) = 12.97, P < 0.001, ETAP 2 = 0.094. THE DAILY PRACTICE OF YOGA SHOWED THE HIGHEST MWB. CONCLUSIONS: ACCORDING TO OUR FINDINGS, IT CAN BE STATED THAT REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER LEVEL OF MWB WHICH CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN DEALING WITH COVID-19 ISSUES SUCH AS STRESS AND DEPRESSION.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
14 1906  22 RETURNING TO YOGA PRACTICE AND TEACHING AFTER TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY. PATIENTS WHO PRACTICE YOGA ARE MOTIVATED TO RETURN TO PRACTICE AFTER TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY (THA). WITH CASE REPORTS OF DISLOCATIONS DURING YOGA, THE SAFETY OF SUCH A RETURN IS UNCLEAR. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE TIMING AND FEASIBILITY OF A RETURN IN A SUBSET OF HIGHLY EXPERIENCED AND MOTIVATED PATIENTS. BETWEEN 2010 AND 2019, A TOTAL OF 19 THA'S PERFORMED IN 14 PATIENTS WHO SELF-IDENTIFIED AS YOGA INSTRUCTORS WERE RETROSPECTIVELY REVIEWED. PATIENTS WHO PRACTICED YOGA BUT WERE NOT TEACHERS WERE EXCLUDED FROM THIS SERIES. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES WERE THE ABILITY TO RETURN TO YOGA, TO RESUME TEACHING, AND FLUENCY WITH 14 CLASSIC POSES. SECONDARY OUTCOMES MEASURED WERE PATIENT-REPORTED HIP DISABILITY AND OSTEOARTHRITIS OUTCOME SCORE (HOOS, JR.), COMPLICATIONS, AND RADIOGRAPHIC POSITION OF THE IMPLANTS. AFTER SURGERY, ALL PATIENTS RETURNED TO PRACTICING AND TEACHING YOGA, AND THE MEAN TIME TO EACH WAS 2 MONTHS. ALL PATIENTS WERE ABLE TO PERFORM ALL 14 CLASSIC POSES. AT A MEAN FOLLOW-UP OF 5 YEARS (SD +/- 4), THERE WERE NO COMPLICATIONS, AND THE MEAN HOOS, JR SCORE WAS 92 POINTS (SD +/- 15). THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT A RETURN TO YOGA IN AN EXPERIENCED POPULATION IS NOT ONLY POSSIBLE BUT ALSO SAFE AFTER A DIRECT ANTERIOR THA. LIMITATIONS IN PERFORMING THE POSES SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD, AND APPROPRIATE MODIFICATIONS SHOULD BE INCORPORATED WHEN NEEDED.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
15  328  33 ANTIHYPERTENSIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN A GENERAL PATIENT POPULATION: REAL-WORLD EVIDENCE FROM ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS, A RETROSPECTIVE CASE-CONTROL STUDY. BACKGROUND: DESPITE DECADES OF RESEARCH AND ESTABLISHED TREATMENT STRATEGIES, HYPERTENSION REMAINS A PREVALENT AND INTRACTABLE PROBLEM AT THE POPULATION LEVEL. YOGA, A LIFESTYLE-BASED PRACTICE, HAS DEMONSTRATED ANTIHYPERTENSIVE EFFECTS IN CLINICAL TRIAL SETTINGS, BUT LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT ITS EFFECTIVENESS IN THE REAL WORLD. HERE, WE USE ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS TO INVESTIGATE THE ANTIHYPERTENSIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA AS USED BY PATIENTS IN THEIR DAILY LIVES. METHODS: A RETROSPECTIVE, OBSERVATIONAL CASE-CONTROL STUDY OF 1815 RECORDS AMONG 1355 YOGA EXPOSED PATIENTS AND 40,326 RECORDS AMONG 8682 YOGA NON-EXPOSED PATIENTS COLLECTED BETWEEN 2006 AND 2016 FROM A REGIONAL ACADEMIC HEALTH SYSTEM. LINEAR MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS WERE USED TO ESTIMATE THE AVERAGE TREATMENT EFFECT OF YOGA ON SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURES. MIXED EFFECTS LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELS WERE USED TO CALCULATE ODDS RATIOS FOR YOGA USE AND FOUR BLOOD PRESSURE CATEGORIES: NORMAL, ELEVATED, STAGE I, AND STAGE II HYPERTENSION. RESULTS: YOGA PATIENTS ARE PREDOMINANTLY WHITE (88.0%) AND FEMALE (87.8%) WITH MEDIAN AGE 46 YEARS (IQR 32-57) WHO USE YOGA ONE TIME PER WEEK (62.3%). YOGA IS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER SYSTOLIC (- 2.8 MMHG, STANDARD ERROR 0.6; P < .001) AND DIASTOLIC (- 1.5 MMHG, STANDARD ERROR 0.5; P = 0.001) BLOOD PRESSURES. PATIENTS USING YOGA HAVE 85% INCREASED ODDS (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.39-2.46) OF HAVING NORMAL BLOOD PRESSURE RELATIVE TO YOGA NON-EXPOSED PATIENTS. PATIENTS AGED 40-59 YEARS HAVE 67% DECREASED ODDS (0.33, 95% CI 0.14-0.75) OF HAVING STAGE II HYPERTENSION. ALL EFFECT SIZES ARE AGE-DEPENDENT. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA, AS USED BY PATIENTS IN THEIR DAILY LIVES, MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY FOR BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL AND THE PREVENTION OF HYPERTENSION AT THE POPULATION LEVEL.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
16 1774  26 PRACTICE AND ACCEPTABILITY OF YOGA AMONG PREGNANT WOMEN IN INDIA: A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY. THE PRACTICE OF YOGA IS BENEFICIAL DURING PREGNANCY, BUT WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT PROPORTION OF PREGNANT WOMEN IN INDIA PRACTICE YOGA. TO ADDRESS THIS RESEARCH GAP, WE CONDUCTED A STUDY TO ADDRESS FOLLOWING RESEARCH QUESTIONS: (1) WHAT PROPORTION OF PREGNANT WOMEN IN RURAL MAHARASHTRA PRACTICE YOGA? (2) WHICH SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRACTICE OF YOGA AMONG THESE WOMEN? AND (3) WHAT IS THE PERCEIVED ACCEPTABILITY OF INTEGRATING YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION INTO ROUTINE ANTENATAL CARE? A CONSECUTIVE SAMPLE OF PREGNANT WOMEN ATTENDING THE ANTENATAL CLINIC OF A TERTIARY CARE HOSPITAL, WHO COULD FLUENTLY COMMUNICATE IN MARATHI AND WHO DID NOT HAVE ANY SERIOUS PHYSICAL ILLNESS OR COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, WERE INCLUDED IN THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY. A TOTAL OF 228 SUBJECTS WERE INCLUDED IN OUR STUDY. YOGA WAS PRACTICED BY 38 OF THEM (16.7%, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL 12.1-22.1) DURING THE CURRENT PREGNANCY. OLDER AGE, HIGHER EDUCATION, AND BEING A PROFESSIONAL (TEACHER, HEALTHCARE PROVIDER, OR BANK OFFICIAL) WERE ASSOCIATED WITH PRACTICE OF YOGA. MORE THAN HALF OF THE PARTICIPANTS (53.9%) THOUGHT THAT YOGA SHOULD BE INCLUDED AS PART OF THEIR ANTENATAL CARE; THIS PERCEIVED ACCEPTABILITY OF YOGA WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH ANY OF THE SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS EXCEPT FOR THE PARTICIPANTS' OCCUPATION. THIS STUDY PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE PREVALENCE AND SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRACTICE OF YOGA AMONG PREGNANT WOMEN IN A RURAL SETTING IN INDIA. IT ALSO EXPLORES THE PERCEIVED ACCEPTABILITY OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS AMONG THIS GROUP. FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY CAN INFORM DESIGN OF FUTURE STUDIES TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS DURING PREGNANCY.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
17 1802  31 PREVALENCE AND PREDICTORS OF YOGIC BREATHING AND MEDITATION USE - A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SURVEY OF US ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS. INTRODUCTION: YOGA PRACTICE IN COMMON USAGE IS OFTEN CONFINED TO THE PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF THE COMPREHENSIVE PRACTICE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE USE OF TWO ADDITIONAL ASPECTS OF YOGA AS PART OF YOGA PRACTICE, I.E. YOGIC BREATHING AND MEDITATION (YOBAM). PREVALENCE AND PREDICTORS OF YOBAM USE AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS IN THE US GENERAL POPULATION WERE ANALYZED. METHOD: CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA FROM THE 2012 AND 2017 NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY (NHIS) (N = 61,267) WAS USED. 12-MONTH PREVALENCE OF YOGA USE AND YOBAM USE AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS WERE ANALYZED DESCRIPTIVELY FOR THE TWO COHORTS RESPECTIVELY. LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSES WERE USED TO ANALYZE SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND HEALTH-RELATED PREDICTORS OF YOBAM USE AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS. RESULTS: 12-MONTH PREVALENCE OF YOGA USE AND YOBAM USE WERE 8.9 % AND 4.8 % RESPECTIVELY IN 2012. IN 2017, 13.3 % HAD PRACTICED YOGA IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS AND 7.0 % HAD USED YOBAM. YOGA PRACTITIONERS AGED BETWEEN 50 AND 64 COMPARED TO BEING 29 OR YOUNGER, FEMALES, HISPANICS AND THOSE EXPERIENCING MILD TO SEVERE FORMS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS WERE MORE LIKELY TO USE YOBAM AS PART OF THEIR YOGA PRACTICE. YOGA PRACTITIONERS LIVING IN THE MIDWEST OR IN A RELATIONSHIP WERE LESS LIKELY TO USE YOBAM. CONCLUSION: IN RECENT YEARS, THE NUMBER OF YOGA PRACTITIONERS IN THE US GENERAL POPULATION HAS CONSIDERABLY INCREASED AND YOBAM USE IS COMMON AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS. YOBAM USE SEEMS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH AGE, GENDER, ETHNICITY, REGION, MARITAL STATUS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS DIMENSIONS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
18 1805  25 PREVALENCE OF TYPE 2 DIABETES AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS: A PILOT CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY IN TWO DISTRICTS IN INDIA. INTRODUCTION: DIABETES IS ONE OF THE MAJOR HEALTH DISEASES IN THE WORLD TODAY. THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES IS WELL-ESTABLISHED. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE PREVALENCE OF TYPE 2 DIABETES AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS IN TWO DISTRICTS OF INDIA (ONE EACH IN WEST AND SOUTH OF INDIA). METHODOLOGY: IN THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL FIELD STUDY, 155 YOGA PRACTITIONERS FROM PUNE AND 192 FROM ERNAKULAM DISTRICTS WERE ASSESSED USING THE DIABETES RISK TEST AND FASTING BLOOD SUGAR. THE DATA COLLECTED WERE ENTERED IN A STATISTICS SOFTWARE PACKAGE AND ANALYZED USING THE PEARSON'S CORRELATION ANALYSIS, T-TEST, UNIVARIATE ANOVA, AND LINEAR REGRESSION TO UNDERSTAND THE PREDICTORS OF RISK FOR DIABETES. RESULTS: THE OVERALL PREVALENCE OF DIABETES AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS IN CENTRAL PUNE WAS 3.6% (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI]: [0.01-0.04]). 18.9% OF PARTICIPANTS (95% CI: [0.16-0.19]) WERE DIAGNOSED TO BE "AT RISK" FOR DIABETES. IN ERNAKULAM, THE OVERALL PREVALENCE OF DIABETES AMONG PRACTITIONERS WAS 26% (95% CI: [0.05-0.06]) WITH 12% OF PRACTITIONERS (95% CI: [0.05-0.06]) DIAGNOSED TO BE "AT RISK" FOR DIABETES (PREDIABETIC). HIGHER AGE AND LESSER DURATION OF YOGA PRACTICE WERE SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS OF DIABETES. CONCLUSION: IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR EVERY PERSON ABOVE THE AGE OF 40 TO UNDERGO REGULAR HEALTH CHECK-UPS AND SCREENING FOR DIABETES AND INVOLVE ONESELF IN LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION PROGRAMS SUCH AS YOGA FOR SIGNIFICANTLY LONG DURATION OF TIME ON A DAILY BASIS, TO BETTER MANAGE DIABETES.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
19  554  30 CORRELATION OF PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE WITH INTENT TO RECOMMEND ADJUNCTIVE OSTEOPATHIC MANIPULATIVE TREATMENT OR YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. CONTEXT: OSTEOPATHIC MANIPULATIVE TREATMENT (OMT) AND YOGA ARE BOTH RECOMMENDED BY SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS IN THE EVIDENCE-BASED RESEARCH LITERATURE FOR LOW BACK PAIN MANAGEMENT. IT IS UNKNOWN, TO THE AUTHORS' KNOWLEDGE, WHAT THE EFFECT OF PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH OMT OR YOGA, READING RESEARCH ARTICLES ON OMT OR YOGA, OR BOTH WILL HAVE ON MEDICAL STUDENTS' RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THESE TREATMENT OPTIONS TO FUTURE PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF OSTEOPATHIC MEDICAL STUDENTS RECOMMENDING OMT OR YOGA TO TREAT PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN BASED ON THEIR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OR READING RESEARCH ARTICLES THAT RECOMMEND OMT OR YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. METHODS: IN THIS PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY, RESEARCHERS ADMINISTERED AN ANONYMOUS 18-QUESTION ONLINE SURVEY FOR OSTEOPATHIC MEDICAL STUDENTS. THE SURVEY INCLUDED A PATIENT VIGNETTE, 2 EVIDENCE-BASED ARTICLES, AND MULTIPLE CHOICE, YES/NO, AND LIKERT-TYPE QUESTIONS. PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED VIA EMAIL FROM ALL 4 YEARS OF MEDICAL SCHOOL. BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCES IN PROPORTIONS WERE ASSESSED WITH DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS AND CHI2 TESTS; DIFFERENCES WITHIN GROUPS WERE ASSESSED WITH THE MCNEMAR TEST; AND FISCHER EXACT TESTS WERE USED WHEN EXPECTED CELL COUNTS WERE LESS THAN 5. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 180 PARTICIPANTS (100 MALE, 80 FEMALE) COMPLETED THE STUDY. PERSONAL EXPERIENCE INCREASED THE LIKELIHOOD OF OSTEOPATHIC MEDICAL STUDENTS RECOMMENDING OMT (P<.018) OR YOGA (P<.001) TO A FUTURE PATIENT OR TO A PATIENT IN A CASE VIGNETTE (P<.05) WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. STUDENTS WHO READ RESEARCH ARTICLES WERE MORE LIKELY TO RECOMMEND OMT TO THE CASE PATIENT AND FUTURE PATIENTS BEFORE AND AFTER READING THE INTERVENTION ARTICLE REGARDLESS OF THEIR EXPERIENCE (P<.001). CONCLUSION: PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND READING EVIDENCE-BASED RESEARCH MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT OSTEOPATHIC MEDICAL STUDENTS WILL RECOMMEND OMT TO FUTURE PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
20 2262  26 THE PREVALENCE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA OR MEDITATION USERS IN ICELAND: RESULTS OF A NATIONAL HEALTH SURVEY. BACKGROUND: USE OF YOGA OR MEDITATION HAS INCREASED DECISIVELY IN RECENT YEARS. FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF YOGA AND MEDITATION ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. THE AIM WAS TO FOCUS ON THE RELATIONSHIP OF YOGA AND MEDITATION TO SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND, RELIGIOSITY, HEALTHCARE-RELATED ATTITUDES, MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH, AND PHYSICIAN VISITS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS STUDY BUILDS ON DATA FROM A NATIONAL HEALTH SURVEY OF A RANDOM SAMPLE OF ICELANDIC ADULTS, AGED 18-75 (N = 1599; RESPONSE RATE OF 58%). RESULTS: THE OVERALL USE OF YOGA OR MEDITATION REACHED 19.3% IN 2015. THIS IS AN INCREASE OF 12.5% POINTS OVER A NINE-YEAR PERIOD. THE INCREASE WAS MUCH GREATER FOR WOMEN. YOGA OR MEDITATION USE WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO THE FEMALE GENDER, YOUNGER AGE, HIGHER LEVELS OF EDUCATION, AND NOT BELONGING TO A RELIGIOUS DENOMINATION.

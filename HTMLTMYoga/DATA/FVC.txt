1  865 130 EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICES ON PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS INCLUDING TRANSFER FACTOR OF LUNG FOR CARBON MONOXIDE (TLCO) IN ASTHMA PATIENTS. PRANA IS THE ENERGY, WHEN THE SELF-ENERGIZING FORCE EMBRACES THE BODY WITH EXTENSION AND EXPANSION AND CONTROL, IT IS PRANAYAMA. IT MAY AFFECT THE MILIEU AT THE BRONCHIOLES AND THE ALVEOLI PARTICULARLY AT THE ALVEOLO-CAPILLARY MEMBRANE TO FACILITATE DIFFUSION AND TRANSPORT OF GASES. IT MAY ALSO INCREASE OXYGENATION AT TISSUE LEVEL. AIM OF OUR STUDY IS TO COMPARE PULMONARY FUNCTIONS AND DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN PATIENTS OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA BEFORE AND AFTER YOGIC INTERVENTION OF 2 MONTHS. SIXTY STABLE ASTHMATIC-PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS I.E GROUP 1 (YOGA TRAINING GROUP) AND GROUP 2 (CONTROL GROUP). EACH GROUP INCLUDED THIRTY PATIENTS. LUNG FUNCTIONS WERE RECORDED ON ALL PATIENTS AT BASELINE, AND THEN AFTER TWO MONTHS. GROUP 1 SUBJECTS SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT (P<0.001) IN TRANSFER FACTOR OF THE LUNG FOR CARBON MONOXIDE (TLCO), FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1ST SEC (FEV1), PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR), MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION (MVV) AND SLOW VITAL CAPACITY (SVC) AFTER YOGA PRACTICE. QUALITY OF LIFE ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT PRANAYAMA & YOGA BREATHING AND STRETCHING POSTURES ARE USED TO INCREASE RESPIRATORY STAMINA, RELAX THE CHEST MUSCLES, EXPAND THE LUNGS, RAISE ENERGY LEVELS, AND CALM THE BODY.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
2  214  55 A STUDY OF THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA. THE ROLE OF YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES, AS AN ADJUNCT TREATMENT FOR BRONCHIAL ASTHMA IS WELL RECOGNIZED. ONE HUNDRED TWENTY PATIENTS OF ASTHMA WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS I.E GROUP A (YOGA TRAINING GROUP) AND GROUP B (CONTROL GROUP). EACH GROUP INCLUDED SIXTY PATIENTS. PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS WERE PERFORMED ON ALL THE PATIENTS AT BASELINE, AFTER 4 WEEKS AND THEN AFTER 8 WEEKS. MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS IN THE TWO GROUPS HAD MILD DISEASE (34 PATIENTS IN GROUP A AND 32 IN GROUP B). GROUP A SUBJECTS SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASING TREND (P < 0.01) IN % PREDICTED PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN THE FIRST SECOND (FEV1), FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), FORCED MID EXPIRATORY FLOW IN 0.25-0.75 SECONDS (FEF25-75) AND FEV1/FVC% RATIO AT 4 WEEKS AND 8 WEEKS AS COMPARED TO GROUP B. THUS, YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES USED ADJUNCTIVELY WITH STANDARD PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
3  878  44 EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING AND DETRAINING ON RESPIRATORY MUSCLE STRENGTH IN PRE-PUBERTAL CHILDREN: A RANDOMIZED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN I(ST) SECOND (FEV1), PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR), FEVI/FVC RATIO, AND PULMONARY PRESSURES [MAXIMUM INSPIRATORY PRESSURE (MIP), MAXIMUM EXPIRATORY PRESSURE (MEP) AT THE END OF 3 MONTHS YOGA TRAINING AND THE DETRAINING EFFECT ON THE ABOVE PARAMETERS IN 7-9-YEARS-OLD SCHOOL GOING CHILDREN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 100 PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED FROM A SCHOOL IN BANGALORE. AFTER BASELINE ASSESSMENTS, THE PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO EITHER YOGA OR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY GROUP. INTERVENTION WAS GIVEN FOR 3 MONTHS, AND MEASURES OF PULMONARY FUNCTION AND PULMONARY PRESSURES WERE DETERMINED IMMEDIATELY POST-INTERVENTION AND AT 3-MONTHS FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: ALTHOUGH SIGNIFICANT INCREASE WAS OBSERVED IN FVC, FEV1, PEFR, FEV1/FVC, MIP, AND MEP AT POST-INTERVENTION, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO STUDY GROUPS AFTER ADJUSTING FOR HEIGHT AND AGE POST TRAINING . HOWEVER, MIP INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN BOTH THE GROUPS POST-INTERVENTION, BUT THE YOGA GROUP PERFORMED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE PE GROUP. THE EFFECTS OF TRAINING DID NOT FADE OFF EVEN AFTER 3 MONTHS OF DETRAINING. IN FACT, THE FVC AND FEV1 CONTINUED TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY. A TREND OF DECREASE WAS OBSERVED IN PEFR, MIP, AND MEP. HOWEVER, THE VALUES DID NOT REGRESS TO THE BASELINE VALUE. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT PRACTICE OF YOGA FOR A SHORT DURATION (3 MONTHS) OF TIME CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE RESPIRATORY MUSCLE STRENGTH IN PEDIATRIC POPULATION.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
4  880  46 EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON HANDGRIP, RESPIRATORY PRESSURES AND PULMONARY FUNCTION. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REPORTS ON THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS, VERY FEW STUDIES HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN ON THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON RESPIRATORY PRESSURES AND HANDGRIP ENDURANCE. HENCE THE PRESENT WORK WAS PLANNED TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON HAND GRIP STRENGTH (HGS), HAND GRIP ENDURANCE (HGE), MAXIMUM EXPIRATORY PRESSURE (MEP), MAXIMUM INSPIRATORY PRESSURE (MIP), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME (FEV), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN FIRST SECOND (FEV1) AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR). 20 SCHOOL CHILDREN IN THE AGE GROUP OF 12 TO 15 YEARS WERE GIVEN YOGA TRAINING (ASANS AND PRANAYAMS) FOR 6 MONTHS. 20 AGE AND GENDER-MATCHED STUDENTS FORMED THE CONTROL GROUP. YOGA TRAINING PRODUCED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.05) INCREASE IN HGS AND HGE. MEP, MIP, FEV, FEV1 AND PEFR ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (P < 0.001) AFTER THE YOGA TRAINING. IN CONTRAST, THE INCREASE IN THESE PARAMETERS IN THE CONTROL GROUP WAS STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT. OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT YOGA TRAINING FOR 6 MONTHS IMPROVES LUNG FUNCTION, STRENGTH OF INSPIRATORY AND EXPIRATORY MUSCLES AS WELL AS SKELETAL MUSCLE STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT YOGA BE INTRODUCED AT SCHOOL LEVEL IN ORDER TO IMPROVE PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS, OVERALL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE OF STUDENTS.	2003	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
5  777  52 EFFECT OF YOGA AND PHYSIOTHERAPY ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN CHILDREN WITH DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY - A COMPARATIVE STUDY. CONTEXT: ABNORMAL RESPIRATORY FUNCTION IS KNOWN TO BE DETECTABLE ALMOST AS SOON AS IT CAN BE MEASURED RELIABLY. STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED THE EFFECT OF RESPIRATORY MUSCLE TRAINING AS WELL AS BREATHING EXERCISES IN IMPROVING PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN CHILDREN WITH DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY (DMD). AIMS: THIS STUDY AIMS TO IDENTIFY THE ADD-ON EFFECT OF YOGA OVER PHYSIOTHERAPY ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN CHILDREN WITH DMD. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FOUR PATIENTS WITH DMD WERE RANDOMIZED TO TWO GROUPS. GROUP I RECEIVED HOME-BASED PHYSIOTHERAPY AND GROUP II RECEIVED PHYSIOTHERAPY ALONG WITH YOGA INTERVENTION. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PULMONARY FUNCTION TEST (PFT) WAS ASSESSED BEFORE THE INTERVENTION (BASELINE DATA) AND AT REGULAR INTERVALS OF 3 MONTHS FOR A PERIOD OF 1 YEAR. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: NORMALITY WAS ASSESSED USING SHAPIRO-WILK NORMALITY TEST. THE BASELINE DATA WERE ANALYZED USING MANN-WHITNEY U-TEST TO IDENTIFY THE HOMOGENEITY. REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE WAS USED TO ASSESS SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN STUDY PARAMETERS DURING THE ASSESSMENT OF EVERY 3 MONTHS, BOTH WITHIN AND BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS OF PATIENTS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 88 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED ALL THE 5 ASSESSMENTS, WITH A MEAN AGE OF 7.9 +/- 1.5 YEARS. PFT PARAMETERS SUCH AS FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE, MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION (MVV), AND TIDAL VOLUME DURING MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION (MVT) DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN GROUP I. IN GROUP II, FVC AND MVT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED FROM BASELINE UP TO 1 YEAR, WHEREAS MVV IMPROVED FROM BASELINE UP TO 9 MONTHS. TIDAL VOLUME DID NOT SHOW ANY CHANGES IN BOTH THE GROUPS. CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT INTRODUCTION OF YOGA WITH PHYSIOTHERAPY INTERVENTION AT AN EARLY AGE CAN BE CONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES IN IMPROVING PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH DMD.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
6 1123  35 EFFICACY OF NATUROPATHY AND YOGA IN BRONCHIAL ASTHMA. THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF A ONE MONTH IN-PATIENT NATUROPATHY AND YOGA PROGRAMME FOR PATIENTS WITH ASTHMA. RETROSPECTIVE DATA OF 159 BRONCHIAL ASTHMA PATIENTS, UNDERGOING THE NATUROPATHY AND YOGA PROGRAMME, WAS ANALYZED FOR FORCED VITAL CAPACITY, FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME AT THE END OF 1 SECOND, MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE ON ADMISSION, 11TH DAY, ON DISCHARGE AND ONCE IN THREE MONTHS FOR THREE YEARS. THE PAIRED SAMPLE T TEST RESULTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE FORCED VITAL CAPACITY AND FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME FROM THE DATE OF ADMISSION UP TO 6TH MONTH (P < 0.0035) POST BONFERRONI CORRECTION. MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FROM ADMISSION TILL THE DATE OF DISCHARGE (P < 0.0035) AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FROM ADMISSION TILL THE 36TH MONTH OF FOLLOW-UP (P < 0.0035), POST BONFERRONI CORRECTION. THIS VALIDATED THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF COMBINING NATUROPATHY AND YOGA FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
7  867  70 EFFECT OF YOGA REGIMEN ON LUNG FUNCTIONS INCLUDING DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE PATIENTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. BACKGROUND: LUNG FUNCTIONS ARE FOUND TO BE IMPAIRED IN CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD), CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE, LEFT VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION, AND AFTER CARDIAC SURGERY. DIFFUSION CAPACITY PROGRESSIVELY WORSENS AS THE SEVERITY OF CAD INCREASES DUE TO REDUCTION IN LUNG TISSUE PARTICIPATING IN GAS EXCHANGE. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISES AND YOGIC POSTURES MAY PLAY AN IMPRESSIVE ROLE IN IMPROVING CARDIO-RESPIRATORY EFFICIENCY AND FACILITATING GAS DIFFUSION AT THE ALVEOLO-CAPILLARY MEMBRANE. THIS STUDY WAS DONE TO SEE THE EFFECT OF YOGA REGIMEN ON LUNG FUNCTIONS PARTICULARLY DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN CAD PATIENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 80 STABLE CAD PATIENTS BELOW 65 YEARS OF AGE OF BOTH SEXES WERE SELECTED AND RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS OF 40 EACH. GROUP I CAD PATIENTS WERE GIVEN YOGA REGIMEN FOR 3 MONTHS WHICH CONSISTED OF YOGIC POSTURES, PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISES, DIETARY MODIFICATION, AND HOLISTIC TEACHING ALONG WITH THEIR CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE WHILE GROUP II CAD PATIENTS WERE PUT ONLY ON CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE. LUNG FUNCTIONS INCLUDING DIFFUSION CAPACITY WERE RECORDED THRICE IN BOTH THE GROUPS: 0 DAY AS BASELINE, 22(ND) DAY AND ON 90(TH) DAY BY USING COMPUTERIZED MS MEDISOFT CARDIO-RESPIRATORY INSTRUMENT, HYP'AIR COMPACT MODEL OF CARDIO-RESPIRATORY TESTING MACHINE WAS MANUFACTURED BY P K MORGAN, INDIA. THE RECORDED PARAMETERS WERE STATISTICALLY ANALYZED BY REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA FOLLOWED BY TUKEY'S TEST IN BOTH THE GROUPS. CARDIOVASCULAR PARAMETERS WERE ALSO COMPARED BEFORE AND AFTER INTERVENTION IN BOTH THE GROUPS. RESULTS: STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE SEEN IN SLOW VITAL CAPACITY, FORCED VITAL CAPACITY, PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE, MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION, AND DIFFUSION FACTOR/ TRANSFER FACTOR OF LUNG FOR CARBON MONOXIDE AFTER 3 MONTHS OF YOGA REGIMEN IN GROUP I. FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1(ST) SEC (FEV1), AND FEV1 % ALSO SHOWED A TREND TOWARD IMPROVEMENT ALTHOUGH NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. HR, SBP AND DBP ALSO SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN GROUP-I PATIENTS WHO FOLLOWED YOGA REGIMEN. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA REGIMEN WAS FOUND TO IMPROVE LUNG FUNCTIONS AND DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN CAD PATIENTS BESIDES IMPROVING CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTIONS. THUS, IT CAN BE USED AS A COMPLIMENTARY OR ADJUNCT THERAPY ALONG WITH THE CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE FOR THEIR TREATMENT AND REHABILITATION.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
8 2786  46 YOGA THERAPY AS AN ADJUVANT IN MANAGEMENT OF ASTHMA. OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON CONTROL OF ASTHMA IN CHILDREN WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA. METHODS: THIS HOSPITAL-BASED INTERVENTIONAL RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL CONDUCTED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PEDIATRICS AT A TERTIARY CARE CENTER OF NORTH INDIA FROM NOVEMBER 2017 TO OCTOBER 2018 ENROLLED 140 NEWLY DIAGNOSED CASES OF ASTHMA OF AGE 10-16 Y WHO WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS. SEVENTY CHILDREN IN THE CASE GROUP PRACTICED YOGA UNDER SUPERVISION FOR A PERIOD OF 3 MO IN ADDITION TO PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT. SEVENTY CONTROLS RECEIVED ONLY PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT. PULMONARY-FUNCTION TESTS WERE DONE AT BASELINE, 6 WK, AND 12 WK ALONG WITH QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) ASSESSMENT BY PEDIATRIC ASTHMA QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE (PAQLQ). THE OUTCOME MEASURES ASSESSED WERE FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN ONE SECOND (FEV1), FEV1/FVC AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR). QOL EVALUATION WAS DONE IN 3 DOMAINS: ACTIVITY LIMITATION, SYMPTOMS, AND EMOTIONAL FUNCTION. RESULTS: THE ASTHMATIC CHILDREN PRACTICING YOGA HAVE SHOWN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC AND PEFR WHICH WAS BETTER AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS. IMPROVEMENT WAS ALSO NOTED IN MEAN-PAQLQ SCORE IN CASES WHICH WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS. CONCLUSION: YOGA APPEARS TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECT ON CONTROL OF ASTHMA MEASURED BY PULMONARY-FUNCTION TEST AND QOL. THEREFORE YOGA THERAPY CAN BE RECOMMENDED AS AN ADJUVANT IN MANAGEMENT OF ASTHMA ALONG WITH STANDARD PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
9  305  39 AN EVALUATION OF PULMONARY PARAMETERS IN TWO GROUPS OF SUBJECTS DURING YOGA PRACTICE. THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE HOW FAR THE SHORT TERM PRACTICE OF YOGA (30 AND 60 DAYS) FOR AN HOUR DAILY CAN IMPROVE THE RESPIRATORY FUNCTION. MALE SUBJECTS (N=50, AGE 30-50 YEARS) WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED. RESPIRATORY PARAMETERS (FVC, FEV1, PEFR, FEF(25-75%) AND MVV) WERE DETERMINED BY USING A MULTIFUNCTIONAL COMPUTERIZED SPIROMETER. YOGA (POSTURE AND PRANAYAMAS) PRACTICE FOR A MONTH PRODUCED NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PULMONARY PARAMETERS. NEVERTHELESS, WHEN THE SUBJECTS CONTINUED IT FOR NEXT 30 DAYS, I.E., AFTER 60 DAYS SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE NOTED IN FVC (P<0.001), FEV, (P<0.01) AND PEFR (P<0.05). THE RESULT ALSO REVEALED THAT AMONGST THEM 30 DAYS YOGA TRAINING RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN FVC IN ELDER GROUP OF PEOPLE (AGE 41-50 YRS) WHERE AS IN YOUNGER GROUP (AGE 30-40 YRS) THE CHANGES WERE NOT SO PROMINENT. RESULT INDICATED THAT SHORT TERM (30 DAYS) YOGA PRACTICE QUICKLY IMPROVES RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS IN RELATIVELY ELDER PEOPLE (AGE 41-50 YRS), WHEN MANY OF THEM IN OUR TROPICAL COUNTRY SUFFER FROM PRIMARY LEVEL OF RESPIRATORY PROBLEM. REGULAR PRACTICE OF YOGA (POSTURE AND PRANAYAMAS) CAN PREVENT IT BY INCREASING THE EFFICACY OF RESPIRATORY MUSCLES.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
10 1520  57 IS YOGA TRAINING BENEFICIAL FOR EXERCISE-INDUCED BRONCHOCONSTRICTION? BACKGROUND: SOME STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH BRONCHIAL HYPERREACTIVITY WITH REGARD TO (1) A REDUCTION IN THE USE OF RESCUE MEDICATION, (2) AN INCREASE IN EXERCISE CAPACITY, AND (3) AN IMPROVEMENT IN LUNG FUNCTION. DESPITE THE FACT THAT YOGA IS PROMISING AS A NEW TREATMENT FOR PEDIATRIC PATIENTS, FURTHER STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO ASSESS THE USE OF THIS TRAINING FOR ASTHMA MANAGEMENT. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY WAS PERFORMED TO ASSESS THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA IN EXERCISE-INDUCED BRONCHOCONSTRICTION (EIB) IN CHILDREN. DESIGN: THE STUDY WAS PROSPECTIVE, WITH NO CONTROL GROUP. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY CHOSEN AMONG THE NEW PATIENTS AT THE UNIT. SETTING: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN THE ERCIYES UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, PEDIATRIC ALLERGY UNIT, IN KAYSERI, TURKEY. PARTICIPANTS: TWO GROUPS OF ASTHMATIC CHILDREN AGED 6-17 Y WERE ENROLLED IN THE STUDY: (1) CHILDREN WITH POSITIVE RESPONSES TO AN EXERCISE CHALLENGE (N = 10), AND (2) THOSE WITH NEGATIVE RESPONSES (N = 10). INTERVENTION: BOTH GROUPS ATTENDED 1-H SESSIONS OF YOGA TRAINING 2 X/WK FOR 3 MO. OUTCOME MEASURES: RESEARCHERS ADMINISTERED SPIROMETRIC MEASUREMENT TO ALL CHILDREN BEFORE AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER PARTICIPATING IN AN EXERCISE CHALLENGE. THIS PROCESS WAS PERFORMED AT BASELINE AND AT THE STUDY'S END. AGE, GENDER, IGE LEVELS, EOSINOPHIL NUMBERS, AND SPIROMETRIC MEASUREMENT PARAMETERS INCLUDING FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1 SEC (FEV1), FORCED EXPIRATORY FLOW 25%-75% (FEF25%-75%), FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW PERCENTAGE (PEF%), AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR) WERE COMPARED USING THE MANN-WHITNEY U TEST AND THE WILCOXON TEST. A P VALUE < .05 WAS CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT. RESULTS: AT BASELINE, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED BETWEEN THE GROUPS REGARDING DEMOGRAPHICS OR PRE-EXERCISE SPIROMETRIC MEASUREMENTS (P > .05, MANN-WHITNEY U TEST). LIKEWISE, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN SPIROMETRIC MEASUREMENTS EXISTED BETWEEN THE GROUPS REGARDING THE CHANGE IN RESPONSES TO AN EXERCISE CHALLENGE AFTER YOGA TRAINING (P > .05, WILCOXON TEST). FOR THE EXERCISE-RESPONSE-POSITIVE GROUP, THE RESEARCH TEAM OBSERVED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN MAXIMUM FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME 1% (FEV1%) FALL FOLLOWING THE EXERCISE CHALLENGE AFTER YOGA TRAINING (P > .05, WILCOXON TEST). ALL EXERCISE-RESPONSE-POSITIVE ASTHMATICS BECAME EXERCISERESPONSE-NEGATIVE ASTHMATICS AFTER YOGA TRAINING. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT TRAINING CHILDREN IN THE PRACTICE OF YOGA HAD BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON EIB. IT IS THE RESEARCH TEAM'S OPINION THAT YOGA TRAINING CAN SUPPLEMENT DRUG THERAPY TO ACHIEVE BETTER CONTROL OF ASTHMA.	2014	

11  751  27 EFFECT OF SHORT TERM YOGA PRACTICE ON VENTILATORY FUNCTION TESTS. TWENTYFIVE NORMAL MALE VOLUNTEERS UNDERGOING A TEN WEEKS COURSE IN THE PRACTICE OF YOGA HAVE BEEN STUDIED BY SOME PARAMETERS OF VENTILATORY FUNCTIONS TESTS. THE OBSERVATIONS RECORDED AT THE END OF TEN WEEKS OF THE COURSE HAVE SHOWN IMPROVED VENTILATORY FUNCTIONS IN THE FORM OF LOWERED RESPIRATORY RATE, INCREASED FORCED VITAL CAPACITY, FEV1, MAXIMUM BREATHING CAPACITY AND BREATH HOLDING TIME, WHILE TIDAL VOLUME AND %FEV1, DID NOT REVEAL ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. THUS, A COMBINED PRACTICE OF YOGA SEEMS TO BE BENEFICIAL ON RESPIRATORY EFFICIENCY.	1988	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
12  844  38 EFFECT OF YOGA ON PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS OF HYPOTHYROID PATIENTS. AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO SEE ANY EFFECT ON RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS IN HYPOTHYROID PATIENTS AFTER PRANAYAMA (YOGA). THE SUBJECTS FOR THE STUDY WERE 20 HYPOTHYROID FEMALES, 39.70 +/- 8.27 YEARS OF MEAN AGE REFERRED FROM MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF UCMS & G.T.B. HOSPITAL. SPIRO METRIC RECORDINGS WERE TAKEN WITH HYPAIR (VERSION-1.28). BASELINE (FIRST) RECORDINGS WERE TAKEN WHEN PATIENT CAME FOR THE FIRST TIME. PATIENTS CAME TO YOGA LAB IN PHYSIOLOGY DEPARTMENT FOR 21 DAYS CONTINUOUSLY WHERE THEY WERE TRAINED BY THE YOGA INSTRUCTORS AND THEN TOLD TO DO PRANAYAMA AT HOME AND CALLED AT REGULAR INTERVALS AFTER 7 DAYS TO SEE THE COMPLIANCE. THE BREATHING EXERCISES WERE DONE FOR 45 MINUTES EVERYDAY. AFTER 6 MONTHS OF PRANAYAMA SECOND RECORDING WAS TAKEN AND COMPARED WITH THE BASELINE. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN FIRST SECOND (FEV1), MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION (MVV) AND INSPIRATORY CAPACITY(IC). THUS PRANAYAMA AND MEDITATION HAS BENEFICIAL EFFECT ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS OF HYPOTHYROID PATIENTS ALONG WITH CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
13 2007  39 STUDY OF YOGA ASANAS IN ASSESSMENT OF PULMONARY FUNCTION IN NIDDM PATIENTS. CERTAIN YOGA ASANAS IF PRACTICED REGULARLY ARE KNOWN TO HAVE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON HUMAN BODY. THESE YOGA PRACTICES MIGHT BE INTERACTING WITH VARIOUS, SOMATO-NEURO-ENDOCRINE MECHANISMS TO HAVE THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS. THE PRESENT STUDY DONE IN TWENTY FOUR NIDDM PATIENTS OF 30 TO 60 YEAR OLD, PROVIDES METABOLIC AND CLINICAL EVIDENCE OF IMPROVEMENT IN GLYCAEMIC CONTROL AND PULMONARY FUNCTIONS. THESE MIDDLE-AGED SUBJECTS WERE TYPE II DIABETICS ON ANTIHYPERGLYCAEMIC AND DIETARY REGIMEN. THEIR BASELINE FASTING AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE AND GLYCOSYLATED HB WERE MONITORED ALONG WITH PULMONARY FUNCTION STUDIES. THE EXPERT GAVE THESE PATIENTS TRAINING IN YOGA ASANAS AND WERE PURSED 30-40 MIN/DAY FOR 40 DAYS UNDER GUIDANCE. THESE ASANAS CONSISTED OF 13 WELL KNOWN POSTURES, DONE IN A SEQUENCE. AFTER 40 DAYS OF YOGA ASANAS REGIMEN, THE PARAMETERS WERE REPEATED. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS (BASAL 190.08 +/- 90.8 IN MG/DL TO 141.5 +/- 79.8 IN MG/DL). THE POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS ALSO DECREASED (276.54 +/- 101.0 IN MG/DL TO 201.75 +/- 104.1 IN MG/DL), GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN SHOWED A DECREASE (9.03 +/- 1.4% TO 7.83 +/- 2.6%). THE FEV1, FVC, PEFR, MVV INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (1.81 +/- 0.4 LT TO 2.08 +/- 0.4 LT, 2.20 +/- 0.6 LT TO 2.37 +/- 0.5 LT, 3.30 +/- 1.0 LT/S TO 4.43 +/- 1.4 LT/S AND 64.59 +/- 25.7 LT MIN TO 76.28 +/- 28.1 LT/MIN RESPECTIVELY). FEV1/FVC% IMPROVED (85 +/- 0.2% TO 89 +/- 0.1%). THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT BETTER GLYCAEMIC CONTROL AND PULMONARY FUNCTIONS CAN BE OBTAINED IN NIDDM CASES WITH YOGA ASANAS AND PRANAYAMA. THE EXACT MECHANISM AS TO HOW THESE POSTURES AND CONTROLLED BREATHING, INTERACT WITH SOMATO-NEURO-ENDOCRINE MECHANISM AFFECTING METABOLIC AND PULMONARY FUNCTIONS REMAINS TO BE WORKED OUT.	2002	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
14 2662  44 YOGA IN BURN: ROLE OF PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISE ON PULMONARY FUNCTION, RESPIRATORY MUSCLE ACTIVITY AND EXERCISE TOLERANCE IN FULL-THICKNESS CIRCUMFERENTIAL BURNS OF THE CHEST. BACKGROUND: CIRCUMFERENTIAL BURN OF CHEST (CBC) IS A SIGNIFICANT TYPE OF BURN AND CONSIDERS AS A MAJOR CAUSE OF RESTRICTIVE LUNG DISEASE (RLD). PATIENT WHO HAS CBC WITH RLD LEADS TO RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS SUCH AS BREATHING DIFFICULTY, AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION, REDUCED EXERCISE CAPACITY AND ALTERED PULMONARY FUNCTIONS. HOWEVER, STUDIES EXAMINING THE ROLE OF PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISE ON PULMONARY FUNCTION, RESPIRATORY MUSCLE ACTIVITY AND EXERCISE TOLERANCE IN FULL THICKNESS CIRCUMFERENTIAL BURN OF CHEST ARE LACKING. OBJECTIVE: TO FIND THE SHORT TERM EFFECTS OF PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISE ON PULMONARY FUNCTION, RESPIRATORY MUSCLE ACTIVITY AND EXERCISE TOLERANCE IN FULL THICKNESS CIRCUMFERENTIAL BURNS OF CHEST. METHODS: THROUGH SIMPLE RANDOM SAMPLING METHOD THIRTY SUBJECTS (N = 30) WITH RLD FOLLOWING CBC WERE ALLOCATED TO PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISE GROUP (PBE-G; N = 15) AND CONVENTIONAL BREATHING EXERCISE GROUP (CBE-G; N = 15). THEY RECEIVED PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISE AND CONVENTIONAL BREATHING EXERCISE FOR 4 WEEKS RESPECTIVELY. ALL THE SUBJECTS RECEIVED CHEST MOBILITY EXERCISE AS COMMON TREATMENT. PRIMARY (NUMERIC PAIN RATING SCALE - NPRS, FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME (FEV1), FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC) AND MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION (MVV) AND SECONDARY (ELECTROMYOGRAM OF STERNOCLEIDOMASTOID, SCALENE, EXTERNAL INTERCOSTAL AND DIAPHRAGM MUSCLE, 6 MIN WALK TEST & GLOBAL RATING OF CHANGE - GRC) OUTCOME MEASURES WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE, AFTER FOUR WEEKS AND AFTER THREE MONTHS FOLLOW UP. RESULTS: BASELINE DEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL VARIABLES SHOW HOMOGENOUS DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN THE GROUPS (P > 0.05). FOUR WEEKS FOLLOWING DIFFERENT BREATHING EXERCISES, PBE-G GROUP SHOWS MORE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PAIN INTENSITY, PULMONARY FUNCTION, RESPIRATORY MUSCLE ACTIVITY, EXERCISE TOLERANCE AND GLOBAL RATING OF CHANGE THAN CBE-G GROUP (P </= 0.05) AT FOUR WEEKS AND THREE MONTHS FOLLOW UP. CONCLUSION: BOTH GROUPS SHOWED IMPROVEMENT OVER TIME. HOWEVER, DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GROUPS WERE NOTICED SMALL. STILL PHYSIOTHERAPY MANAGEMENT, WHICH INCLUDED PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISES WITH CHEST MOBILIZATION PROGRAM, HAD AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY IN THE TREATMENT OF RESTRICTIVE LUNG DISEASE FOLLOWING CIRCUMFERENTIAL BURN OF CHEST.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
15   54  40 A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND SWIMMING ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN SEDENTARY SUBJECTS. CONTEXT: THE MODALITY OF EXERCISE THAT IS MOST BENEFICIAL AND EASY TO PERFORM HAS BECOME A TOPIC OF RESEARCH. YOGIC EXERCISES ARE BEING WIDELY STUDIED; HOWEVER, POSTULATED BENEFITS OF YOGIC EXERCISES OVER OTHER EXERCISES MUST BE SCIENTIFICALLY EXPLORED. PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED COMPARATIVE STUDIES INVOLVING YOGA AND OTHER ENDURANCE EXERCISES ARE CONSPICUOUS BY THEIR ABSENCE. AIM: THIS STUDY WAS, THEREFORE, DESIGNED TO ASSESS AND COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF YOGIC TRAINING AND SWIMMING ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN NORMAL HEALTHY YOUNG VOLUNTEERS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 100 VOLUNTEERS WERE INDUCTED INTO THE STUDY AND RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: ONE GROUP UNDERWENT 12 WEEKS TRAINING FOR YOGIC EXERCISES AND OTHER FOR SWIMMING. THE TRAINING AND DATA ACQUISITION WAS DONE IN SMALL COHORTS OF 10 SUBJECTS EACH. THE SUBJECTS WERE ASSESSED BY STUDYING THEIR ANTHROPOMETRIC PARAMETERS AND PULMONARY FUNCTION PARAMETERS (FVC, FEV1/FVC RATIO, PEFR, FEF25-75%, FEF 0.2-1.2 L AND MVV) BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER TRAINING. RESULTS: ALL PARAMETERS SHOWED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS AFTER BOTH YOGA AND SWIMMING. COMPARISON OF THESE IMPROVEMENTS FOR DIFFERENT PARAMETERS STATISTICALLY ANALYZED BY UNPAIRED T TEST OR MANN WHITNEY U TEST DEPICTED A STATISTICALLY BETTER IMPROVEMENT IN FVC, FEF25-75% AND MVV WITH SWIMMING AS COMPARED TO YOGIC EXERCISES. CONCLUSIONS: THE OUTPUT OF THIS STUDY GIVES SLIGHT EDGE TO SWIMMING AS A PREFERRED MODALITY OF EXERCISE THOUGH EITHER YOGA OR SWIMMING CAN BE ADVOCATED AS AN EXERCISE PRESCRIPTION AS BOTH THE MODALITIES CAUSE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OF RESPIRATORY HEALTH. HOWEVER, OTHER FACTORS LIKE ABILITY OF ANY EXERCISE REGIME TO KEEP CONTINUED MOTIVATION AND INTEREST OF THE TRAINEES MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT FOR EXERCISE PRESCRIPTION.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
16 2803  22 YOGA THERAPY IN CHRONIC BRONCHITIS. FIFTEEN PATIENTS OF CHRONIC BRONCHITIS RECEIVED YOGA THERAPY IN THE FORM OF PRANAYAM AND 8 TYPES OF 'ASANS' FOR A PERIOD OF 4 WEEKS. THEY HAD A PERCEPTIBLE IMPROVEMENT IN DYSPNOEA AS WAS MEASURED BY VISUAL ANALOG. LUNG FUNCTION PARAMETERS (VC, FEV1, AND PEFR) ALSO IMPROVED AFTER THE PRACTICE OF YOGA. THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY INDICATES THAT, YOGA MAY BE AN USEFUL ADJUNCT TO OTHER CONVENTIONAL FORM OF THERAPY FOR COPD.	1998

A FOLLOW-UP STUDY SPANNING TWO YEARS SHOWED A GOOD RESPONSE WITH REDUCED SYMPTOM SCORE AND DRUG REQUIREMENTS IN THESE SUBJECTS. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT YOGA TRAINING IS BENEFICIAL FOR YOUNG ASTHMATICS.	1991	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
18 1026  29 EFFECTS OF YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES ON PULMONARY FUNCTION IN PATIENTS WITH DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY: AN EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVE: DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY (DMD) IS THE MOST COMMON FORM OF MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY IN CHILDREN, AND CHILDREN WITH DMD DIE PREMATURELY BECAUSE OF RESPIRATORY FAILURE. WE SOUGHT TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES, AS WELL AS THE EFFECTS OF THOSE EXERCISES ON RESPIRATORY FUNCTION, IN SUCH CHILDREN. METHODS: THIS WAS A PROSPECTIVE OPEN-LABEL STUDY OF PATIENTS WITH A CONFIRMED DIAGNOSIS OF DMD, RECRUITED FROM AMONG THOSE FOLLOWED AT THE NEUROLOGY OUTPATIENT CLINIC OF A UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL IN THE CITY OF SAO PAULO, BRAZIL. PARTICIPANTS WERE TAUGHT HOW TO PERFORM HATHA YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES AND WERE INSTRUCTED TO PERFORM THE EXERCISES THREE TIMES A DAY FOR 10 MONTHS. RESULTS: OF THE 76 PATIENTS WHO ENTERED THE STUDY, 35 DROPPED OUT AND 15 WERE UNABLE TO PERFORM THE BREATHING EXERCISES, 26 HAVING THEREFORE COMPLETED THE STUDY (MEAN AGE, 9.5 +/- 2.3 YEARS; BODY MASS INDEX, 18.2 +/- 3.8 KG/M(2)). THE YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN FVC (% OF PREDICTED: 82.3 +/- 18.6% AT BASELINE VS. 90.3 +/- 22.5% AT 10 MONTHS LATER; P = 0.02) AND FEV1 (% OF PREDICTED: 83.8 +/- 16.6% AT BASELINE VS. 90.1 +/- 17.4% AT 10 MONTHS LATER; P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES CAN IMPROVE PULMONARY FUNCTION IN PATIENTS WITH DMD.	2014

20 1139  23 EFFICACY OF YOGA TRAINING IN CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE PATIENTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVES: TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF YOGA TRAINING IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD). METHOD: A LITERATURE SEARCH WAS PERFORMED IN PUBMED, COCHRANE LIBRARY, EMBASE, CINAHL, AND WEB OF SCIENCE FOR RELEVANT STUDIES PUBLISHED BEFORE JUNE 2017. QUALITY ASSESSMENT, SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS AND HETEROGENEITY WERE PERFORMED. STATA12.0 SOFTWARE WAS USED FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. RESULTS: TEN STUDIES WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS ANALYSIS. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN 6MWD (P = 0.000), BORG SCALE SCORES (P = 0.018), FEV1 VALUE (P = 0. 013), PACO2 (P = 0.037), SGRQ SCORES (P = 0. 000) AND CAT SCORES (P = 0.009) IN YOGA TRAINING PATIENTS. NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED IN THE FEV1/FVC (P = 0.75), FEV1 PREDICTED VALUE (P = 0.057) AND FVC (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: THIS META-ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT YOGA TRAINING CAN BE AN ACCEPTABLE AND APPROPRIATED ADJUNCTIVE REHABILITATION PROGRAM FOR COPD PATIENTS.	2018

1 2278 102 THE ROLES OF SELF-COMPASSION, BODY SURVEILLANCE, AND BODY APPRECIATION IN PREDICTING INTRINSIC MOTIVATION FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: CROSS-SECTIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, AND PROSPECTIVE CHANGES WITHIN A YOGA CONTEXT. ENGAGING IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOR THE IMMEDIATE INTERNAL EXPERIENCES IT BRINGS (E.G., PLEASURE, SATISFACTION) IS CRITICAL FOR LONG-TERM EXERCISE ADHERENCE. INVESTIGATIONS OF HOW FACTORS SUCH AS BODY IMAGE CONTRIBUTE TO INTRINSIC MOTIVATION FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ARE NEEDED. THE PRESENT STUDY EXAMINED BODY SURVEILLANCE AND BODY APPRECIATION AS MEDIATORS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SELF-COMPASSION AND INTRINSIC MOTIVATION FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY CROSS-SECTIONALLY AND PROSPECTIVELY. ONE SAMPLE OF COLLEGE WOMEN COMPLETED MEASURES OF STUDY VARIABLES AT ONE TIME POINT (SAMPLE 1; N = 269, MAGE = 19.96) AND A SECOND SAMPLE DID SO DURING WEEKS 1, 8, AND 16 WHILE PARTICIPATING IN A 16-WEEK YOGA COURSE (SAMPLE 2; N = 323, MAGE = 20.31). IN SAMPLE 1, LATENT VARIABLE STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING SUPPORTED BODY APPRECIATION AS A MEDIATOR BETWEEN SELF-COMPASSION AND INTRINSIC MOTIVATION FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. IN SAMPLE 2, LATENT GROWTH CURVE ANALYSES REVEALED THAT CHANGE IN SELF-COMPASSION PREDICTED CHANGES IN BODY SURVEILLANCE AND BODY APPRECIATION IN EXPECTED DIRECTIONS. FURTHER, CHANGE IN BODY APPRECIATION POSITIVELY PREDICTED CHANGE IN INTRINSIC MOTIVATION. TARGETING SELF-COMPASSION AND BODY APPRECIATION MAY HELP SUPPORT WOMEN'S INTRINSIC MOTIVATION FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
2 1785  27 PREDICTORS OF YOGA USE AMONG INTERNAL MEDICINE PATIENTS. BACKGROUND: YOGA SEEMS TO BE AN EFFECTIVE MEANS TO COPE WITH A VARIETY OF INTERNAL MEDICINE CONDITIONS. WHILE CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA USERS HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED IN THE GENERAL POPULATION, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT PREDICTORS OF YOGA USE AND BARRIERS TO YOGA USE IN INTERNAL MEDICINE PATIENTS. THE AIM OF THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYSIS WAS TO IDENTIFY SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC, CLINICAL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PREDICTORS OF YOGA USE AMONG INTERNAL MEDICINE PATIENTS. METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED AMONG ALL PATIENTS BEING REFERRED TO A DEPARTMENT OF INTERNAL AND INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DURING A 3-YEAR PERIOD. IT WAS ASSESSED WHETHER PATIENTS HAD EVER USED YOGA FOR THEIR PRIMARY MEDICAL COMPLAINT, THE PERCEIVED BENEFIT, AND THE PERCEIVED HARM OF YOGA PRACTICE. POTENTIAL PREDICTORS OF YOGA USE INCLUDING SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, HEALTH BEHAVIOR, INTERNAL MEDICINE DIAGNOSIS, GENERAL HEALTH STATUS, MENTAL HEALTH, SATISFACTION WITH HEALTH, AND HEALTH LOCUS OF CONTROL WERE ASSESSED; AND ASSOCIATIONS WITH YOGA USE WERE TESTED USING MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS. ODDS RATIOS (OR) WITH 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CI) WERE CALCULATED FOR SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS. RESULTS: OF 2486 PARTICIPANTS, 303 (12.19%) REPORTED HAVING USED YOGA FOR THEIR PRIMARY MEDICAL COMPLAINT. OF THOSE, 184 (60.73%) REPORTED BENEFITS AND 12 (3.96%) REPORTED HARMS DUE TO YOGA PRACTICE. COMPARED TO YOGA NON-USERS, YOGA USERS WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE 50-64 YEARS OLD (OR = 1.45; 95%CI = 1.05-2.01; P = 0.025); FEMALE (OR = 2.45; 95%CI = 1.45-4.02; P < 0.001); AND COLLEGE GRADUATES (OR = 1.61; 95%CI = 1.14-2.27; P = 0.007); AND LESS LIKELY TO CURRENTLY SMOKE (OR = 0.61; 95%CI = 0.39-0.96; P = 0.031). MANIFEST ANXIETY (OR = 1.47; 95%CI = 1.06-2.04; P = 0.020); AND HIGH INTERNAL HEALTH LOCUS OF CONTROL (OR = 1.92; 95%CI = 1.38-2.67; P < 0.001) WERE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA USE, WHILE HIGH EXTERNAL-FATALISTIC HEALTH LOCUS OF CONTROL (OR = 0.66; 95%CI = 0.47-0.92; P = 0.014) WAS NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA USE. CONCLUSION: YOGA WAS USED FOR THEIR PRIMARY MEDICAL COMPLAINT BY 12.19% OF AN INTERNAL INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE PATIENT POPULATION AND WAS COMMONLY PERCEIVED AS BENEFICIAL. YOGA USE WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH THE PATIENTS' SPECIFIC DIAGNOSIS BUT WITH SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS, MENTAL HEALTH, AND HEALTH LOCUS OF CONTROL. TO IMPROVE ADHERENCE TO YOGA PRACTICE, IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED THAT MALE, YOUNGER, AND ANXIOUS PATIENTS AND THOSE WITH LOW INTERNAL HEALTH LOCUS OF CONTROL MIGHT BE LESS INTRINSICALLY MOTIVATED TO START YOGA.	2013	
         
3 1535  15 KARMA YOGA: A PATH TOWARDS WORK IN POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY. KARMA YOGA IS THE PATH THAT LEADS TO SALVATION THROUGH ACTION. SALVATION IS THE ULTIMATE STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS. WORK IS THE CENTRAL AND DEFINING CHARACTERISTIC OF LIFE. IT MAY HAVE INTRINSIC VALUE, INSTRUMENTAL VALUE, OR BOTH. INSTRUMENTAL VALUE INCLUDES INCENTIVE, DIGNITY AND POWER, ETC., WHICH IS THE RESULT EXPECTED FROM THE WORK. THE GITA TEACHES US TO DO WORK WITHOUT THINKING OF RESULT (WORK WITH INTRINSIC VALUE). ATTACHMENT WITH THE RESULT LEADS TO STRESS, COMPETITION AND AGGRESSION. STRESS FURTHER GIVES RISE TO HEART AILMENTS, DEPRESSION AND SUICIDE. POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY STUDIES THE FACTORS AND CONDITIONS LEADING TO PLEASURABLE AND SATISFYING LIFE. UNDERSTANDING KARMA YOGA AND ITS PRACTICE HAS A SIMILAR ROLE THAT LEAD AN INDIVIDUAL TOWARDS WORK AND LEADING TO A SATISFIED LIFE. THIS MAY PLAY A UNIQUE ROLE TOWARDS PRACTICAL ASPECTS OF POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY TO IMPROVE ONE'S LIFESTYLE AND AID IN THE TREATMENT OF STRESS DISORDERS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
4 2372  32 WHAT HELPS OLDER PEOPLE PERSEVERE WITH YOGA CLASSES? A REALIST PROCESS EVALUATION OF A COVID-19-AFFECTED YOGA PROGRAM FOR FALL PREVENTION. BACKGROUND: FALLS AMONG OLDER PEOPLE ARE A MAJOR GLOBAL HEALTH CONCERN. THIS PROCESS EVALUATION INVESTIGATES THE EXPERIENCE OF PARTICIPANTS AGED 60+ IN A YOGA PROGRAM AIMED AT PREVENTING FALLS WHICH TRANSITIONED FROM STUDIO-BASED CLASSES TO ONLINE CLASSES IN RESPONSE TO COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS. WE SOUGHT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE SUCCESSFUL AGEING (SAGE) YOGA PROGRAM FUNCTIONED IN BOTH SETTINGS AND AS A HYBRID PROGRAM, AND TO EXPLAIN WHY IT WORKED WELL FOR MOST PARTICIPANTS. METHODS: REALIST PROCESS EVALUATION WAS USED TO EXPLORE THE FACTORS THAT FACILITATED A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION FOR MOST PARTICIPANTS, AND TO CONSIDER WHY IT DID NOT WORK FOR A MINORITY. THIS APPROACH DEVELOPS PROGRAM THEORIES THAT DESCRIBE WHICH MECHANISMS AN INTERVENTION IS (OR IS NOT) ACTIVATING, AND HOW THIS IS MEDIATED BY CONTEXT TO GENERATE PROCESS OUTCOMES. DATA INCLUDED INTERVIEWS WITH PARTICIPANTS (N = 21) AND YOGA INSTRUCTORS (N = 3), SELF-REPORT FEEDBACK FORMS (N = 46), OBSERVATION OF CLASSES AND ROUTINE PROCESS MEASURES. RESULTS: FACTORS THAT FACILITATED A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION FOR MOST PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED THE QUALITY OF YOGA INSTRUCTION, THE PROGRAM FORMAT AND INHERENT CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA. GAINS IN TRANSITIONING ONLINE INCLUDED CONTINUITY AND GREATER CONVENIENCE. LOSSES INCLUDED PERCEIVED REDUCTION IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA INSTRUCTION. THERE WERE GREATER CHALLENGES FOR PEOPLE STRUGGLING WITH PAIN AND IN DISADVANTAGEOUS HOME ENVIRONMENTS. WE IDENTIFIED SIX PROGRAM THEORIES CONFIGURED AROUND 16 MECHANISMS: 1. IT'S WORTH THE EFFORT AND 2. IN EXPERT HANDS (THESE HAD THE SAME MECHANISMS: VALUE EXPECTANCY, THERAPEUTIC ALLIANCE AND ACHIEVEMENT/MASTERY), 3. A COMMUNAL EXPERIENCE (THESE MECHANISMS WERE SHARED EXPERIENCE, SOCIAL CONNECTION, SOCIAL COMPARISON AND PEER CHECKING), 4. PUTTING YOGA WITHIN REACH (ACCESSIBILITY, CONVENIENCE, GRATITUDE), 5. BUILDING YOGA HABITS (PURPOSEFUL STRUCTURE, MOMENTUM, ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTINUITY), AND 6. YOGA'S SPECIAL PROPERTIES (EMBODIMENT AND MINDFULNESS). CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT ONLINE DELIVERY OF A YOGA PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE AGED 60+ RETAINED MUCH OF THE VALUE OF A FACE-TO-FACE PROGRAM FOR THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS, AND INCREASED THE VALUE FOR SOME. THE STRUCTURED, COMMUNAL NATURE OF AN ORGANISED GROUP PROGRAM DELIVERED BY A SKILLED INSTRUCTOR, TOGETHER WITH YOGA'S INTRINSIC FOCUS ON MINDFULNESS, FACILITATED CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT AND PERCEIVED HEALTH BENEFITS, DESPITE THE CHANGE IN DELIVERY MODE.	2022	

5 2071  20 THE EFFECT OF A SINGLE YOGA CLASS ON INTEROCEPTIVE ACCURACY IN PATIENTS AFFECTED BY ANOREXIA NERVOSA AND IN HEALTHY CONTROLS: A PILOT STUDY. PURPOSE: TO EVALUATE INTEROCEPTIVE ACCURACY (IAC) BEFORE AND AFTER A SINGLE YOGA CLASS IN A POPULATION OF PATIENTS WITH ANOREXIA NERVOSA (AN) AND IN A POPULATION OF HEALTHY CONTROLS (HC). METHODS: FIFTEEN PATIENTS WITH AN AND TWENTY HC WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. ALL INDIVIDUALS PARTICIPATED IN A SINGLE YOGA CLASS. BEFORE (T0) AND AFTER (T1) THE YOGA CLASS, THEY UNDERWENT THE HEARTBEAT DETECTION TASK FOR THE EVALUATION OF IAC. AT T0, ALL PARTICIPANTS ALSO UNDERWENT A PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT, INCLUDING EVALUATION OF DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, BODY AWARENESS, ALEXITHYMIA, SELF-OBJECTIFICATION AND EATING DISORDERS PSYCHOPATHOLOGY. RESULTS: PATIENTS WITH AN HAD LOWER IAC THAN HC AT T0. A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OF IAC AT T1 WAS FOUND IN THE HC GROUP BUT NOT IN THE GROUP OF PATIENTS WITH AN. CONCLUSION: WE INFER THAT OUR FINDINGS MIGHT BE LINKED TO THE FACT THAT PATIENTS WITH AN, DIFFERENTLY FROM HC, DID NOT PROPERLY ATTEND TO THEIR BODIES, DESPITE THE YOGA CLASS. THIS HYPOTHESIS IS CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS STUDIES SHOWING THAT PATIENTS WITH AN HAVE DECREASED IAC DURING SELF-FOCUSED BEHAVIOR BECAUSE OF BODY-RELATED AVOIDANCE. MOREOVER, WE SURMISE THAT HC MIGHT BE KEENER TO IMPROVE THEIR PERCEPTION OF INTERNAL BODY SIGNALS EVEN AFTER A SINGLE YOGA CLASS BECAUSE THEIR EMOTIONAL AWARENESS SYSTEM IS NOT IMPAIRED. PATIENTS WITH AN, ON THE CONTRARY, MAY HAVE AN INTRINSIC IMPAIRMENT OF THEIR EMOTIONAL AWARENESS, MAKING IT HARDER FOR THEM TO MODULATE THEIR IAC. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: LEVEL III, EVIDENCE OBTAINED FROM WELL-DESIGNED COHORT OR CASE-CONTROL ANALYTICAL STUDIES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
6  586  28 DETERMINANTS OF MAINTAINING A DAILY YOGA PRACTICE: HEALTH LOCUS OF CONTROL AND SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY PERSPECTIVE. BACKGROUND: DESPITE THE GROWING EVIDENCE OF THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF A YOGA PRACTICE, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO ITS SUSTAINED PRACTICE. AIMS: THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PRESENT STUDY WERE TWOFOLD: (1) TO DESCRIBE THE PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS (AGE, EDUCATION LEVEL, AND MARITAL STATUS) AND YOGA ASANA-RELATED BEHAVIOR OF PARTICIPANTS WHO PRACTICE ASHTANGA AND (2) TO EXAMINE THE HEALTH LOCUS OF CONTROL (HLOC) (AN INDIVIDUAL'S BELIEFS ABOUT THE EXTENT OF CONTROL THAT THEY HAVE OVER THINGS THAT HAPPEN TO THEM) AND SELF-DETERMINATION THEORIES. (PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO BECOME SELF-DETERMINED WHEN THEIR NEEDS FOR COMPETENCE, CONNECTION, AND AUTONOMY ARE FULFILLED IN RELATION TO THE MOTIVATED BEHAVIOR.). METHODS: ASHTANGA YOGA PRACTITIONERS (N = 100, AGE RANGE: 20-62 YEARS) REPORTED PRACTICING YOGA AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK COMPLETED SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES: DEMOGRAPHICS, ASANA PRACTICE, THE PERCEIVED CHOICE AND AWARENESS OF SELF SCALE, HLOC, THE GENERAL HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE-12, THE PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE, AND THE STATE-TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY. RESULTS: IT WAS OBSERVED THAT PARTICIPANTS PRACTICED YOGA FOR AN AVERAGE 6.43 YEARS, 5 DAYS A WEEK FOR 93 MIN REPRESENTING A SUSTAINED, MOTIVATED HEALTH-RELATED BEHAVIOR. YEARS OF PRACTICE AND PERCENTAGE OF TIME SPENT IN HOME PRACTICE EXPLAIN 9% OF THE VARIANCE IN THE AWARENESS OF SELF, AND 7% IS EXPLAINED BY THE NUMBER OF PRACTICE DAYS A WEEK AND STATE ANXIETY. ASHTANGA YOGA PRACTITIONERS HAVE A HIGH INTERNAL HLOC; THIS IS RELATED TO REDUCED TRAIT ANXIETY AND INCREASED PERCEIVED CHOICE. CONCLUSIONS: THE MYSORE SYSTEM OF YOGA APPEARS TO FACILITATE SUSTAINED HEALTH-RELATED BEHAVIOR; IT IS SUGGESTED THAT HEALTH PROMOTION SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THE THREE ASPECTS OF SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY: COMPETENCE, AUTONOMY, AND RELATEDNESS, WHILE FOCUSING ON THE INCREASING INTRINSIC MOTIVATION AND INTERNALIZING HLOC.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
7   43  14 A CASE REPORT OF PATIENT PRACTISING YOGA LEADING TO DENTAL EROSION. THE ARTICLE PRESENTS THE CASE OF A PATIENT WHO WAS PRACTISING YOGA (KUNJAL KRIYA) WHICH LED TO DENTAL EROSION. DENTAL EROSION CAN BE DUE TO EXTRINSIC OR INTRINSIC CAUSES. THE INTRINSIC CAUSES INCLUDE VOMITING DUE TO ANOREXIA NERVOSA, REGURGITATION DUE TO ABNORMALITY IN GASTRO-INTESTINAL TRACT OR RUMINATION. A 38-YEAR-OLD MALE PATIENT PRESENTED WITH A RARE AETIOLOGY OF DENTAL EROSION. HE HAD PRACTICED KUNJAL KRIYA ONE OF THE YOGIC EXERCISES DESCRIBED IN ANCIENT INDIA. IN KUNJAL KRIYA THE PATIENT VOMITS ON AN EMPTY STOMACH IN ORDER TO CLEAN HIS OR HER GASTRO-INTESTINAL TRACT. THE PATIENT HAD PRACTICED THIS FORM OF EXERCISE FOR OVER 12 YEARS WHICH HAD LED TO SEVERE DENTAL EROSION. A PROPER CASE HISTORY SHOULD BE EVALUATED FOR EVERY PATIENT SO THAT THEY CAN BE COUNSELLED FOR ANY FACTORS THAT COULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO DENTAL HEALTH. EARLY DIAGNOSIS IS PARAMOUNT IN RECOGNISING THE AETIOLOGY OF DENTAL EROSION SO THAT DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON THE DENTITION CAN BE PREVENTED.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
8 2346  17 USING REALIST EVALUATION TO UNDERSTAND PROCESS OUTCOMES IN A COVID-19-IMPACTED YOGA INTERVENTION TRIAL: A WORKED EXAMPLE. REALIST EVALUATION OFFERS A VALUABLE WAY TO UNDERSTAND HOW INTERVENTIONS FUNCTION AND THUS HOW THEY CAN BE IMPROVED AND LOCALLY ADAPTED. CONSEQUENTLY, REALIST EVALUATION IS INCREASINGLY CONDUCTED IN PARALLEL WITH INTERVENTION TRIALS. IT COMPRISES A CLEAR PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATION AND VIEW OF CAUSALITY, PRAGMATIC MIXED DATA COLLECTION METHODS, AND A THEORY-DRIVEN APPROACH IN WHICH HYPOTHESISED PROGRAM THEORIES ARE TESTED AND REFINED. HOWEVER, DETAILED METHODS FOR DATA ANALYSIS ARE SELDOM WELL-DESCRIBED IN REALIST STUDIES AND NO CLEAR METHOD FOR ANALYSING AND PRESENTING REALIST EVALUATION DATA HAS YET EMERGED. IN THIS METHODOLOGICAL PAPER WE USE THE WORKED EXAMPLE OF OUR REALIST PROCESS EVALUATION OF THE SAGE YOGA TRIAL TO ILLUSTRATE AN APPLIED PROCESS OF DATA ANALYSIS AND PRESENTATION OF FINDINGS. WE SHOW HOW WE DREW ON OTHER REALIST STUDIES FOR IDEAS, PROVIDE EXAMPLES OF SIX KEY TASKS INVOLVED IN CONDUCTING A REALIST PROCESS EVALUATION (INCLUDING CODING DATA AND STRUCTURING RESULTS) AND DESCRIBE STRATEGIES THAT DID NOT WORK AND OUR RATIONALE FOR REJECTING THEM. THIS DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE DECISIONS AND METHODS THAT WORKED FOR US IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE A PRACTICAL AND INFORMED POINT OF DEPARTURE FOR RESEARCHERS CONDUCTING A REALIST EVALUATION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
9 1972  25 SHORT-TERM SAHAJA YOGA MEDITATION TRAINING MODULATES BRAIN STRUCTURE AND SPONTANEOUS ACTIVITY IN THE EXECUTIVE CONTROL NETWORK. INTRODUCTION: WHILE CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN NEURAL CHANGES IN LONG-TERM MEDITATORS, THEY MIGHT BE CONFOUNDED BY SELF-SELECTION AND POTENTIAL BASELINE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEDITATORS AND NON MEDITATORS. PROSPECTIVE LONGITUDINAL STUDIES OF THE EFFECTS OF MEDITATION IN NAIVE SUBJECTS ARE MORE CONCLUSIVE WITH RESPECT TO CAUSAL INFERENCES, BUT RELATED EVIDENCE IS SO FAR LIMITED. METHODS: HERE, WE ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF A 4-WEEK SAHAJA YOGA MEDITATION TRAINING ON GRAY MATTER DENSITY AND SPONTANEOUS RESTING-STATE BRAIN ACTIVITY IN A GROUP OF 12 MEDITATION-NAIVE HEALTHY ADULTS. RESULTS: COMPARED WITH 30 CONTROL SUBJECTS, THE PARTICIPANTS TO MEDITATION TRAINING SHOWED INCREASED GRAY MATTER DENSITY AND CHANGES IN THE COHERENCE OF INTRINSIC BRAIN ACTIVITY IN TWO ADJACENT REGIONS OF THE RIGHT INFERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS ENCOMPASSING THE ANTERIOR COMPONENT OF THE EXECUTIVE CONTROL NETWORK. BOTH THESE MEASURES CORRELATED WITH SELF-REPORTED WELL-BEING SCORES IN THE MEDITATION GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: THE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT OF A BRIEF MEDITATION TRAINING ON BRAIN REGIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ATTENTION, SELF-CONTROL, AND SELF-AWARENESS MAY REFLECT THE ENGAGEMENT OF COGNITIVE CONTROL SKILLS IN SEARCHING FOR A STATE OF MENTAL SILENCE, A DISTINCTIVE FEATURE OF SAHAJA YOGA MEDITATION. THE MANIFOLD IMPLICATIONS OF THESE FINDINGS INVOLVE BOTH MANAGERIAL AND REHABILITATIVE SETTINGS CONCERNED WITH WELL-BEING AND EMOTIONAL STATE IN NORMAL AND PATHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
10 1195  27 EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA INSTRUCTION ON POSITIVE EMBODIMENT AND AFFECTIVE RESPONSES. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR THE INCLUSION OF YOGA AS PART OF EATING DISORDER PREVENTION EFFORTS THROUGH ITS POSITIVE IMPACT ON POSITIVE EMBODIMENT AND EXPERIENCE OF POSITIVE CORE AFFECT. HOWEVER, THERE IS A NEED TO IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES THAT WILL MORE CONSISTENTLY SUPPORT POSITIVE EMBODIMENT AND POSITIVE AFFECT. WE EXAMINED THE EFFECT OF TEACHING A SINGLE YOGA CLASS USING MINDFULNESS-BASED INSTRUCTION COMPARED TO APPEARANCE-BASED AND NEUTRAL INSTRUCTION ALTERNATIVES ON EMBODIMENT (I.E., STATE BODY SURVEILLANCE, STATE BODY APPRECIATION, PLEASURE DURING YOGA) AND CHANGES IN AFFECT FROM BEFORE TO AFTER CLASS. FEMALE PARTICIPANTS (N = 62; M AGE = 23.89, SD = 6.86) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A YOGA CLASS THAT EMPHASIZED: BEING MINDFULLY PRESENT IN ONE'S BODY, CHANGING ONE'S APPEARANCE, OR JUST GETTING INTO YOGA POSES. ANOVAS REVEALED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER BODY SURVEILLANCE (ETAP (2) =.10) AND LOWER FORECASTED PLEASURE (ETAP (2) =.21) IN THE APPEARANCE CLASS COMPARED TO THE OTHER TWO CLASSES. PARTICIPANTS IN THE MINDFULNESS CLASS EXPERIENCED GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN AFFECT (ETAP (2) =.08) FROM BEFORE TO AFTER CLASS AND HIGHER REMEMBERED PLEASURE DURING THE YOGA CLASS (ETAP (2) =.19) COMPARED TO THOSE IN THE APPEARANCE CLASS. EMPHASIZING CHANGES TO APPEARANCE IN YOGA INSTRUCTION MAY PLACE PARTICIPANTS AT RISK FOR LESS POSITIVE AFFECT AND LESS POSITIVE EXPERIENCES OF EMBODIMENT COMPARED TO MINDFULNESS-BASED OR EVEN NEUTRAL YOGA INSTRUCTION.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
11  924  16 EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN EATING DISORDERS - A CASE REPORT. EATING DISORDERS ARE AMONG THE MOST COMMON PSYCHOSOMATIC DISEASES AND ARE OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH NEGATIVE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES. THE USE OF YOGA AS A TREATMENT METHOD IN EATING DISORDERS IS CONTROVERSIAL DISCUSSED. THE INTERVIEWEE WAS A 38 YEAR OLD FEMALE PATIENT SUFFERING ON ANOREXIA NERVOSA AND VARIOUS PSYCHOSOMATIC-PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSES IN HER MEDICAL HISTORY. THE PATIENT REPORTED THAT YOGA RECOVERED THE SOUL CONTACT WHICH SHE LOST AND SHE HAD LEARNED TO PERCEIVE AND FEEL HERSELF AGAIN. SHE STATED THAT YOGA HELPED HER TO FIND ACCESS TO HER BODY AND ITS NEEDS AND TO COPE WITH HER TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES. SHE ALSO REPORTED THAT ATTITUDES HAVE CHANGED IN RELATION TO HER STOMACH IN THE TREATMENT OF HER ANOREXIA. THE CASE REPORT CONFIRMED THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF YOGA ON EATING DISORDERS. RESEARCH SHOULD PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE INFLUENCE OF INDIVIDUAL'S CO-MORBIDITIES, AS EATING DISORDERS USUALLY OCCUR IN ASSOCIATION WITH CO-MORBIDITIES.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
12 2392  25 YOGA AND BODY IMAGE: HOW DO YOUNG ADULTS PRACTICING YOGA DESCRIBE ITS IMPACT ON THEIR BODY IMAGE? THIS STUDY EXPLORED THE PERCEIVED IMPACT OF YOGA ON BODY IMAGE. YOUNG ADULTS (N= 34 FEMALE, 12 MALE; MAGE = 30.6 [SD = 1.6]) PRACTICING YOGA WERE INTERVIEWED AND DATA WERE ANALYZED FOR EMERGING THEMES ACROSS WEIGHT STATUS. IN GENERAL, PARTICIPANTS DISCUSSED THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF YOGA ON THEIR BODY IMAGE, BUT SOME DESCRIBED BOTH A POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE IMPACT. YOGA WAS PERCEIVED AS HAVING A POSITIVE IMPACT ON BODY IMAGE VIA PERCEIVED PHYSICAL CHANGES, GRATITUDE FOR ONE'S BODY, A SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT WITHIN ONE'S YOGA PRACTICE, SELF-CONFIDENCE, AND WITNESSING DIFFERENT TYPES OF BODIES PRACTICING YOGA. YOGA WAS PERCEIVED TO HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON BODY IMAGE VIA COMPARATIVE CRITIQUE (E.G., UPWARD COMPARISONS WITH OTHERS) AND INNER CRITIQUE (E.G., NEGATIVE SELF-TALK). THEMES WERE GENERALLY SIMILAR ACROSS WEIGHT STATUS; EXCEPTIONS WERE THAT PARTICIPANTS AT HIGHER WEIGHT STATUS WERE MORE LIKELY THAN THOSE AT LOWER WEIGHT STATUS TO DISCUSS ACCOMPLISHMENT WITHIN ONE'S YOGA PRACTICE AS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON BODY IMAGE AND COMPARATIVE CRITIQUE AS A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON BODY IMAGE. YOGA STUDIOS AND INSTRUCTORS CAN TAKE STEPS TO FURTHER ENHANCE THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF YOGA AND TO PROVIDE ENVIRONMENTS THAT ARE INCLUSIVE OF PARTICIPANTS WITH DIVERSE BODY SHAPES AND SIZES.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
13  664  23 EFFECT OF 90-MIN BIKRAM YOGA ON BASIC PSYCHOLOGICAL NEEDS AMONG PRACTITIONERS IN THE SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES. BACKGROUND: IN OUR MODERN SOCIETY, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS A LIFESTYLE CHOICE. BIKRAM YOGA IS A LOW IMPACT; MODERATE EXERCISE AND THE UNDERSTANDING OF MOTIVATION AND ADHERENCE TO THE PRACTICE IS UNKNOWN. THIS STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF 90 MIN BIKRAM YOGA PRACTICE ON BASIC PSYCHOLOGICAL NEEDS OF COMPETENCE (THE SENSE OF SKILL MASTERY), AUTONOMY (VOLITIONALLY PERFORMING A TASK), AND RELATEDNESS (A CONNECTION WITH OTHERS) AS POSTULATED IN SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY FOR MOTIVATION. METHODS: THE SAMPLE INCLUDED BIKRAM YOGA PRACTITIONERS IN THE SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES (N = 126) AVERAGED BETWEEN THE AGE GROUP OF 35 AND 64, PREDOMINATELY FEMALE, AND HIGHLY EDUCATED. RESPONSES TO THE PSYCHOLOGICAL NEED SATISFACTION IN EXERCISE SCALE WERE ANALYZED USING MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE. RESULTS: RESULTS SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF FREQUENCY OF YOGA ATTENDANCE ON THE SATISFACTION OF BASIC PSYCHOLOGICAL NEEDS (I.E., COMPETENCE, AUTONOMY, AND RELATEDNESS); (P = 0.025); SPECIFICALLY, YOGA PRACTITIONERS WHO ATTENDED FOUR OR MORE CLASSES PER WEEK HAD HIGHER SATISFACTION LEVELS OF BASIC PSYCHOLOGICAL NEED FOR COMPETENCE (P = 0.013) AND RELATEDNESS (P = 0.034). A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF THE LEVEL OF EXPERIENCE ON THE SATISFACTION OF BASIC PSYCHOLOGICAL NEEDS (I.E., COMPETENCE, AUTONOMY, AND RELATEDNESS) (P = 0.014) FOUND IN EXPERIENCED BIKRAM YOGA PRACTITIONERS, SPECIFICALLY FOR COMPETENCE (P = 0.013) AND RELATEDNESS (P = 0.023) COMPARED TO NOVICE COUNTERPARTS. CONCLUSION: THE STUDY PROVIDES SOME EVIDENCE OF AN INDIVIDUAL'S MOTIVATION FOR A 90 MIN BIKRAM YOGA PRACTICE AND POSSIBLE ADHERENCE. FUTURE INVESTIGATION OF BIKRAM YOGA PRACTICE ADOPTING SELF-DETERMINATION THEORY APPEARS WORTHWHILE.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
14   26  25 'A TOOL TO HELP ME THROUGH THE DARKNESS': SUFFERING AND HEALING AMONG TEACHER-PRACTITIONERS OF ASHTANGA YOGA. YOGA IS WIDELY REGARDED AS BENEFICIAL FOR PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL HEALTH, AND AS A SAFE ANCILLARY INTERVENTION FOR MANAGING A RANGE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS. EVIDENCE OF INJURY, HARM, AND ABUSE IN YOGA TRADITIONS IS DIFFICULT TO SQUARE WITH THIS EMPHASIS ON HEALING. DRAWING MAINLY FROM ON ONLINE MEMOIRS BY LONG-TERM PRACTITIONERS OF ASHTANGA YOGA, THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SUFFERING AND HEALING IN YOGA, SHOWING HOW LONG-TERM ABUSE CAN BE PERPETUATED AND INJURY SUSTAINED IN A SYSTEM WIDELY UNDERSTOOD AND LABELLED BY ITS PRACTITIONERS AS THERAPEUTIC. THE PAPER ARGUES THAT ELEMENTS OF HEALING AND HARM ARE PRESENT IN THE RITUALS OF PRACTICE, THE CONCEPTS THAT SUPPORT IT, AND THE POWER STRUCTURE OF THE ASHTANGA SYSTEM. THE SYSTEM'S ORGANIZATIONAL DYNAMICS TOGETHER WITH A THERAPEUTIC DISCOURSE THAT LINKS SUFFERING TO ITS TRANSCENDENCE ENABLED THE SAME KINDS OF ABUSE AND TRAUMA THAT ASHTANGA YOGA IS PURPORTED TO HEAL. THE ANALYSIS RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THE OVERARCHING NARRATIVE OF YOGA AS SAFE AND HEALTHY, AND ABOUT THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN HEALING AND HARM WITHIN THERAPEUTIC TRADITIONS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
15  474  17 CLAIMING PEACEFUL EMBODIMENT THROUGH YOGA IN THE AFTERMATH OF TRAUMA. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DESCRIBE THE EXPERIENCES OF PRACTICING YOGA AND ITS ROLE WITHIN PROCESSES OF HEALING FOR ADULT WOMEN WITH COMPLEX TRAUMA HISTORIES. USING A HERMENEUTIC PHENOMENOLOGICAL METHOD, DATA WERE ANALYZED FROM INTERVIEWS WITH 39 WOMEN. RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE CORE MEANING OF PARTICIPANTS' EXPERIENCE OF HEALING THROUGH YOGA IS CLAIMING PEACEFUL EMBODIMENT. THIS IS AN ONGOING PROCESS OCCURRING ON A CONTINUUM WHEREBY WOMEN EXPERIENCED IMPROVED CONNECTIONS WITH AND SENSE OF OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OVER THEIR BODIES, EMOTIONS AND THOUGHTS, AND A GREATER SENSE OF WELL-BEING, CALMNESS, AND WHOLENESS IN THEIR BODIES AND MINDS. A NUMBER OF INTERCONNECTED ESSENTIAL THEMES RELATED TO THIS CORE MEANING WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED, ILLUMINATING PROCESSES THAT SUPPORTED CLAIMING PEACEFUL EMBODIMENT AND CAPABILITIES THAT WERE ENABLED BY BEING MORE PEACEFULLY EMBODIED. ADDITIONAL THEMES WERE IDENTIFIED HIGHLIGHTING FACTORS THAT FACILITATED OR IMPEDED PARTICIPANTS' ENGAGEMENT WITH YOGA AND THEIR EXPERIENCES OF HEALING THROUGH YOGA.	2015

17  957  22 EFFECTS OF A SINGLE YOGA SESSION ON CARDIAC INTEROCEPTIVE ACCURACY AND EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE. BACKGROUND: THERE IS AN INCREASING BODY OF RESEARCH SUPPORTING THE IDEA THAT CARDIAC INTEROCEPTIVE ACCURACY (IAC) CAN BE IMPROVED BY TRAINING. FINDINGS CONCERNING THE EFFECTS OF A SINGLE YOGA SESSION ON IAC AND THE RELATED CONSTRUCT EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE ARE SPARSE. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE IF A SINGLE YOGA SESSION INCREASES IAC AND IMPROVES EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE. METHODS: 137 STUDENTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A 20-MIN YOGA SESSION (N = 47), AN ENDURANCE SESSION (N = 46), OR AN INACTIVE CONTROL CONDITION (N = 44). IAC AND EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE WERE ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER THE SESSIONS. RESULTS: THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN IAC, OR POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECT. IAC AT BASELINE AND THE CHANGE IN POSITIVE EFFECT WERE FOUND AS PREDICTORS FOR IAC AFTER THE YOGA SESSION. CONCLUSION: A 20-MIN YOGA SESSION SEEMS TO BE NOT APPLICABLE TO IMPROVE IAC AND EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE. FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD INVESTIGATE LONG-TERM INTERVENTIONS AND DIVERSE HEALTHY AND CLINICAL POPULATIONS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
18 2370  37 WHAT BRINGS YOUNG ADULTS TO THE YOGA MAT? CROSS-SECTIONAL ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AND PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH AMONG PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROJECT EAT-IV SURVEY. OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY EXAMINES MOTIVATIONS FOR YOGA AND IDENTIFIES UNIQUE MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AMONG A SAMPLE OF YOUNG ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS. THIS STUDY FURTHER DETERMINES HOW YOUNG ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS' MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES ASSOCIATE WITH PHYSICAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS. SUBJECTS/SETTING: SURVEY DATA WERE DRAWN FROM THE FOURTH WAVE OF A LARGE, POPULATION-BASED STUDY (PROJECT EAT-IV; EATING AND ACTIVITY IN TEENS AND YOUNG ADULTS). DESIGN: LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS (LCA) WAS USED TO IDENTIFY MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AMONG PROJECT EAT-IV PARTICIPANTS PRACTICING YOGA (N = 297; MEAN AGE: 30.8-1.7 YEARS; 79.7 % FEMALE). CROSS-SECTIONAL ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN LATENT MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES, PHYSICAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS WERE DETERMINED WITH UNADJUSTED AND ADJUSTED (GENDER, RACE/ETHNICITY, AND BODY MASS INDEX) GENERAL LINEAR MODELS. RESULTS: ACROSS MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES, MOST YOUNG ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS WERE MOTIVATED BY ENHANCED FITNESS AND STRESS REDUCTION/RELAXATION. ADDITIONAL MOTIVATIONS FOR YOGA CLUSTERED BY APPEARANCE (DESIRE TO CHANGE BODY APPEARANCE OR WEIGHT) OR MINDFULNESS (DESIRE TO INCREASE PRESENT MOMENT AWARENESS) UNDERPINNINGS. THE LCA CHARACTERIZED MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AS "LOW APPEARANCE, LOW MINDFULNESS" (CLASS 1; N = 77), "LOW APPEARANCE, HIGH MINDFULNESS" (CLASS 2; N = 48), "HIGH APPEARANCE, LOW MINDFULNESS" (CLASS 3; N = 79), AND "HIGH APPEARANCE, HIGH MINDFULNESS" (CLASS 4; N = 93). HAVING A PROFILE WITH HIGH MINDFULNESS AND LOW APPEARANCE MOTIVATIONS (CLASS 2) WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER BODY SATISFACTION IN COMPARISON TO THE OTHER CLASSES (P < 0.001). RELATIVE TO CLASS 2, THOSE WITH LOW MINDFULNESS MOTIVATIONS (CLASS 1; CLASS 3) REPORTED LESS TOTAL PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (P = 0.002) AND THOSE WITH HIGH APPEARANCE MOTIVATIONS (CLASS 3; CLASS 4) REPORTED HIGHER COMPULSIVE EXERCISE SCORES (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: IN THIS SAMPLE, HIGH MINDFULNESS AND LOW APPEARANCE MOTIVATIONS FOR YOGA APPEARED OPTIMAL FOR PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH. CROSS-SECTIONAL FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOUNG ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS' MIND-BODY HEALTH MAY BE SUPPORTED BY MOTIVATIONAL UNDERPINNINGS THAT EMPHASIZE YOGA'S INTERNAL (MINDFULNESS) RATHER THAN EXTERNAL (APPEARANCE) BENEFITS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                     
19 2219  18 THE IMPACT OF AN AUTONOMY-SUPPORTIVE YOGA INTERVENTION ON SELF-DETERMINATION IN ADULTS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF AN AUTONOMY-SUPPORTIVE YOGA INTERVENTION ON THE SELF-DETERMINATION OF ADULTS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. RESEARCH SUPPORTS THE USE OF AUTONOMY-SUPPORTIVE INTERVENTIONS TO INCREASE POSITIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES WITH THIS POPULATION. THE PRESENT STUDY UTILIZED A QUALITATIVE APPROACH WITH EIGHT SUBJECTS PARTICIPATING IN SEMI-STRUCTURED QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS. CONTENT ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED SUPPORT FOR THREE THEMES RELATED TO THE IMPACT OF YOGA: AUTONOMY, RELATEDNESS, COMPETENCE. THE RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT THE YOGA INTERVENTION MAY SUPPORT SELF-DETERMINATION FOR ADULTS WITH IDD, AS THE PARTICIPANTS' RESPONSES DEMONSTRATED INCREASED FEELINGS OF AUTONOMY, COMPETENCE, AND RELATEDNESS. THE RESULTS ALSO INDICATED THAT AN AUTONOMY-SUPPORTIVE YOGA INTERVENTION CAN BE ACHIEVED WITH ADULTS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES BY TARGETING THE KEY CONSTRUCTS OF AUTONOMY, RELATEDNESS, AND COMPETENCE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
20  128  29 A PILOT YOGA PHYSICAL EDUCATION CURRICULUM TO PROMOTE POSITIVE BODY IMAGE. WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF A PILOT YOGA-BASED PHYSICAL EDUCATION (PE) CURRICULUM BY TESTING FOR CHANGE IN TRAIT BODY SURVEILLANCE, PHYSICAL SELF-WORTH, AND BODY APPRECIATION. FURTHER, WE EXAMINED THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG CHANGE IN BODY IMAGE VARIABLES AND THE ROLE OF STATE MINDFULNESS IN PREDICTING STATE BODY SURVEILLANCE DURING CLASSES. ADOLESCENTS PARTICIPATED IN 12 WEEKS OF YOGA-BASED (N=20; MAGE=16.45, 90% FEMALE) OR TRADITIONAL (N=23;MAGE=14.52, 57% FEMALE) PE. RESULTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT (P=.004), MODERATE DECREASES IN TRAIT BODY SURVEILLANCE AND MINIMAL NONSIGNIFICANT (P=.11) INCREASES IN PHYSICAL SELF-WORTH.

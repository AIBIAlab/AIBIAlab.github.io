1 1080 115 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF SLEEP OF WOMEN WITH PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME. OBJECTIVE: WOMEN WITH PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME (PMS) COMMONLY COMPLAIN OF SLEEP DISTURBANCES, SPECIFICALLY IN THE LUTEAL PHASE OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE. THEREFORE, THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF SLEEP OF WOMEN EXPERIENCING PMS WAS INVESTIGATED. MATERIAL AND METHODS: WOMEN (AGED 20-45 Y) MONITORED FOR PMS, WHO WERE REFERRED TO THE PRIVATE OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY CLINICS IN TABRIZ, IRAN, WERE REFERRED TO THE PRIVATE OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY CLINICS IN TABRIZ, IRAN. AFTERWARD, 62 WOMEN, WERE SELECTED AND DIVIDED INTO 2 GROUPS, RANDOMLY: 31 SUBJECTS IN YOGA THE YOGA GROUP AND 31 IN THE CONTROL GROUP. SUBJECTS IN YOGA PERFORMED FOR 10 WK IN 3 SESSIONS, WITH EACH SESSION LASTING 60 MIN. SUBJECTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT PERFORM ANY YOGA. SUBJECTS COMPLETED A DEMOGRAPHIC QUESTIONNAIRE AND THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX QUESTIONNAIRE BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA IN BOTH GROUPS. RESULTS: AFTER YOGA INTERVENTION, SUBJECTS SIGNIFICANTLY EXPRESSED IMPROVEMENT IN SLEEPING (P < .05). BASED ON THE MANN-WHITNEY U TEST, A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED IN THE SUBDOMAINS OF BOTH GROUPS ON QUALITY OF SLEEP (P < .01), SLEEP LATENCY (P < .01), AND SLEEP EFFICIENCY (P < .05). CONCLUSION: YOGA REDUCED THE DISTURBANCES OF SLEEP IN THE SUBJECTS WITH PMS, WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY IMPROVED THE EFFICIENCY OF THEIR SLEEP. THEREFORE, WE CONCLUDE THAT YOGA CAN BE PRESCRIBED FOR IMPROVING SLEEP DISTURBANCES IN WOMEN WITH PMS AND MEDICAL THERAPY WILL PROBABLY BE NEEDED IN SEVERE SITUATIONS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
2  351  34 ASSESSMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE IN ASTHMA PATIENTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. BACKGROUND: ASTHMA IS A CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY RESPIRATORY DISEASE CHARACTERIZED BY PERIODIC ATTACKS OF WHEEZING, SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND A TIGHT FEELING IN THE CHEST. THE CURRENT STUDY IS BASED ON THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE IN ASTHMATICS IN NORTHERN INDIA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 300 PARTICIPANTS OF MILD-TO-MODERATE PERSISTENT ASTHMA (FEV1 >60%) AGED BETWEEN 12 AND 60 YEARS WERE RECRUITED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PULMONARY MEDICINE. THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE WAS ASSESSED WITH THE HELP OF MINI ASTHMA QUALITY-OF-LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE (AQLQ) AT BASELINE AND THEN AFTER 3(RD) AND 6(TH) MONTH FROM BASELINE. FORTY-FIVE PARTICIPANTS WERE DROPPED OUT DURING THE STUDY WHILE 255 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE STUDY SUCCESSFULLY. RESULTS: IN "THE YOGA GROUP," SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE FOUND IN ALL THE SUBDOMAINS OF AQLQ AT 3(RD) MONTH AND AT 6(TH) MONTH IN COMPARISON TO "THE CONTROL GROUP." THE NUMBER NEEDED TO TREAT WAS FOUND TO BE 2.67 FOR THE TOTAL AQLQ SCORE WHICH WAS GREATER THAN THE MINIMAL IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE. CONCLUSION: "THE YOGA GROUP" GOT SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER IMPROVEMENT IN ASTHMA QUALITY-OF-LIFE SCORES THAN "THE CONTROL GROUP." THUS, YOGA CAN BE USED AS AN ADJUVANT THERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ASTHMA.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
3 1052  27 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE AND GLOBAL SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN IN OLDER CANCER SURVIVORS. BACKGROUND: SIXTY PERCENT OF CANCER SURVIVORS ARE 65YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER. CANCER AND ITS TREATMENTS LEAD TO CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE AND MANY OTHER SIDE EFFECTS, IN TURN, CREATING SUBSTANTIAL GLOBAL SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN (TOTAL BURDEN FROM ALL SIDE EFFECTS) WHICH, ULTIMATELY, COMPROMISES FUNCTIONAL INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY OF LIFE. VARIOUS MODES OF EXERCISE, SUCH AS YOGA, REDUCE CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE AND GLOBAL SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN IN YOUNGER CANCER SURVIVORS, BUT NO STUDIES HAVE SPECIFICALLY EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON OLDER CANCER SURVIVORS. OBJECTIVES: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF A 4-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION (YOGA FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: YOCAS(C)(R)) ON OVERALL CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, AND DUE TO ITS MULTIDIMENSIONAL NATURE, THE SUBDOMAINS OF CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (GENERAL, PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, AND MENTAL) AND GLOBAL SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN IN OLDER CANCER SURVIVORS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A SECONDARY ANALYSIS ON DATA FROM A MULTICENTER PHASE III RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL WITH 2 ARMS (STANDARD CARE AND STANDARD CARE PLUS A 4-WEEK YOCAS(C)(R) INTERVENTION). THE SAMPLE FOR THIS SECONDARY ANALYSIS WAS 97 OLDER CANCER SURVIVORS (>/=60YEARS OF AGE), BETWEEN 2MONTHS AND 2YEARS POST-TREATMENT, WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE ORIGINAL TRIAL. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOCAS(C)(R) INTERVENTION ARM REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, PHYSICAL FATIGUE, MENTAL FATIGUE, AND GLOBAL SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN THAN PARTICIPANTS IN THE STANDARD CARE ARM FOLLOWING THE 4-WEEK INTERVENTION PERIOD (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: YOCAS(C)(R) IS AN EFFECTIVE STANDARDIZED YOGA INTERVENTION FOR REDUCING CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, PHYSICAL FATIGUE, MENTAL FATIGUE, AND GLOBAL SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN AMONG OLDER CANCER SURVIVORS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
4 1198  22 EXERCISE AND SELF-ESTEEM IN MENOPAUSAL WOMEN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL INVOLVING WALKING AND YOGA. PURPOSE: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF WALKING AND YOGA ON MULTIDIMENSIONAL SELF-ESTEEM AND ROLES PLAYED BY SELF-EFFICACY, BODY COMPOSITION, AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (PA) IN CHANGES IN ESTEEM. DESIGN: FOUR-MONTH RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED EXERCISE TRIAL WITH THREE ARMS: WALKING, YOGA, AND CONTROL. SUBJECTS: PREVIOUSLY LOW-ACTIVE MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN (N=164; M AGE = 49.9; SD = 3.6). INTERVENTION: STRUCTURED AND SUPERVISED WALKING PROGRAM MEETING THREE TIMES PER WEEK FOR I HOUR AND SUPERVISED YOGA PROGRAM MEETING TWICE PER WEEK FOR 90 MINUTES. MEASURES: BODY COMPOSITION, FITNESS ASSESSMENT, AND BATTERY OF PSYCHOLOGIC MEASURES. ANALYSIS: PANEL ANALYSIS WITHIN A STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING FRAMEWORK USING MPLUS 3.0. RESULTS: THE WALKING AND YOGA INTERVENTIONS FAILED TO ENHANCE GLOBAL OR PHYSICAL SELF-ESTEEM BUT IMPROVED SUBDOMAIN ESTEEM RELATIVE TO PHYSICAL CONDITION AND STRENGTH (FOR WALKING) AND BODY ATTRACTIVENESS (FOR BOTH WALKING AND YOGA). OVER TIME THE EFFECTS OF PA, SELF-EFFICACY, AND BODY FAT ON CHANGES IN PHYSICAL SELF-ESTEEM AND GLOBAL ESTEEM WERE MEDIATED BY CHANGES IN PHYSICAL CONDITION AND BODY ATTRACTIVENESS SUBDOMAIN ESTEEM. WOMEN REPORTING GREATER LEVELS OF SELF-EFFICACY AND PA WITH LOWER BODY FAT ALSO REPORTED GREATER ENHANCEMENTS IN SUBDOMAIN ESTEEM. CONCLUSION: THESE RESULTS PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THE HIERARCHIC AND MULTIDIMENSIONAL NATURE OF SELF-ESTEEM AND INDICATE THAT MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN MAY ENHANCE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL SELF-ESTEEM BY PARTICIPATING IN PA.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
5 2233  26 THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS IN CAREGIVERS FOR PATIENTS WITH CANCER. PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF A SIX-WEEK VINYASA YOGA (VY) INTERVENTION ON CAREGIVERS' OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. DESIGN: A SINGLE-GROUP, PRE- AND POST-TEST PILOT STUDY. SETTING: UNIVERSITY PUBLIC RECREATIONAL FACILITY. SAMPLE: 12 INFORMAL CAREGIVERS FOR PATIENTS WITH CANCER. METHODS: CAREGIVERS PARTICIPATED IN A SIX-WEEK VY INTERVENTION AND COMPLETED MEASURES OF QOL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS PRE- AND POSTINTERVENTION. PROGRAM SATISFACTION WAS MEASURED WITH OPEN-ENDED SURVEY QUESTIONS. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: QOL, PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, AND PROGRAM SATISFACTION. FINDINGS: SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE FOUND IN THE MENTAL COMPONENT SCORE OF OVERALL QOL AND IN OVERALL PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. SEVERAL SUBDOMAINS OF QOL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS WERE ALSO IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY. OPEN-ENDED SURVEY QUESTION RESPONSES REVEALED PARTICIPANTS PERCEIVED PHYSICAL AND MENTAL BENEFIT FROM THE INTERVENTION, HIGHLIGHTING IMPROVEMENTS IN FLEXIBILITY, CORE AND UPPER-BODY STRENGTH, BALANCE, BREATHING, AND ENERGY. CONCLUSIONS: INFORMAL CAREGIVERS MAY BENEFIT MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY FROM PARTICIPATING IN VY. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: CAREGIVERS OF PATIENTS WITH CANCER CHARACTERIZE A GROUP WORTHY OF ATTENTION, RESEARCH, AND INTERVENTIONS FOCUSING ON THEIR HEALTHCARE NEEDS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
6 2382  33 YOCAS(C)(R) YOGA REDUCES SELF-REPORTED MEMORY DIFFICULTY IN CANCER SURVIVORS IN A NATIONWIDE RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL: INVESTIGATING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MEMORY AND SLEEP. UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND INTERVENTIONS ARE NEEDED TO ALLEVIATE MEMORY DIFFICULTY IN CANCER SURVIVORS. WE PREVIOUSLY SHOWED IN A PHASE III RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL THAT YOCAS(C)(R) YOGA-A PROGRAM THAT CONSISTS OF BREATHING EXERCISES, POSTURES, AND MEDITATION-SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED SLEEP QUALITY IN CANCER SURVIVORS. THIS STUDY ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF YOCAS(C)(R) ON MEMORY AND IDENTIFIED RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MEMORY AND SLEEP. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: SURVIVORS WERE RANDOMIZED TO STANDARD CARE (SC) OR SC WITH YOCAS(C)(R) . 328 PARTICIPANTS WHO PROVIDED DATA ON THE MEMORY DIFFICULTY ITEM OF THE MD ANDERSON SYMPTOM INVENTORY ARE INCLUDED. SLEEP QUALITY WAS MEASURED USING THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX. GENERAL LINEAR MODELING (GLM) DETERMINED THE GROUP EFFECT OF YOCAS(C)(R) ON MEMORY DIFFICULTY COMPARED WITH SC. GLM ALSO DETERMINED MODERATION OF BASELINE MEMORY DIFFICULTY ON POSTINTERVENTION SLEEP AND VICE VERSA. PATH MODELING ASSESSED THE MEDIATING EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN MEMORY DIFFICULTY ON YOCAS(C)(R) CHANGES IN SLEEP AND VICE VERSA. RESULTS: YOCAS(C)(R) SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED MEMORY DIFFICULTY AT POSTINTERVENTION COMPARED WITH SC (MEAN CHANGE: YOGA=-0.60; SC=-0.16; P<.05). BASELINE MEMORY DIFFICULTY DID NOT MODERATE THE EFFECTS OF POSTINTERVENTION SLEEP QUALITY IN YOCAS(C)(R) COMPARED WITH SC. BASELINE SLEEP QUALITY DID MODERATE THE EFFECTS OF POSTINTERVENTION MEMORY DIFFICULTY IN YOCAS(C)(R) COMPARED WITH SC (P<.05). CHANGES IN SLEEP QUALITY WAS A SIGNIFICANT MEDIATOR OF REDUCED MEMORY DIFFICULTY IN YOCAS(C)(R) COMPARED WITH SC (P<.05); HOWEVER, CHANGES IN MEMORY DIFFICULTY DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY MEDIATE IMPROVED SLEEP QUALITY IN YOCAS(C)(R) COMPARED WITH SC. CONCLUSIONS: IN THIS LARGE NATIONWIDE TRIAL, YOCAS(C)(R) YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED PATIENT-REPORTED MEMORY DIFFICULTY IN CANCER SURVIVORS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                 
7 2737  58 YOGA POSITIVELY AFFECTED DEPRESSION AND BLOOD PRESSURE IN WOMEN WITH PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL. WOMEN WITH PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME (PMS) OFTEN COMPLAIN ABOUT DEPRESSION WHEN THEIR MENSTRUAL CYCLE BEGINS. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON WOMEN WITH PMS SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION DURING MENSTRUAL CYCLE. METHODS: THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED FROM APRIL TO OCTOBER 2015 IN TABRIZ, IRAN. ALL SUBJECTS (20-45 YEARS OLD), WHO WERE FREQUENTLY REFERRED TO THE PRIVATE OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY CLINICS, WERE INITIALLY MONITORED FOR PMS AND DEPRESSION. SUBJECTS COMPLETED THE DEMOGRAPHIC AND BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY-II (BDI-II) QUESTIONNAIRES BEFORE AND AFTER INTERVENTION. IN ADDITION, SUBJECTS WERE MONITORED FOR ELIGIBLE AND INELIGIBLE CRITERIA. IN THIS STUDY 62 SUBJECTS WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED FOR THE YOGA GROUP AND CONTROL GROUPS. SUBJECTS PRACTICED YOGA OVER TWO MONTHS IN THREE SESSIONS, THE DURATION OF EACH SESSION WAS 60MIN. RESULTS: THE GENERAL SCORE OF THE DEPRESSION AFTER YOGA INTERVENTION WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP (P<0.036) AND YOGA GROUP BEFORE INTERVENTION (P<0.001). THE DIASTOLIC PRESSURE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER YOGA INTERVENTION (P<0.029). YOGA DECREASED THE STATE OF DEPRESSION AND DIASTOLIC PRESSURE OF THE SUBJECTS WITH PMS COMPLAINING FROM DEPRESSION. CONCLUSION: WE CONCLUDE THAT YOGA HAS STRONG EFFECTS ON DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AND BLOOD PRESSURE, THEREFORE IT CAN BE USED AS A COMPLEMENTARY OR ALTERNATIVE REMEDY FOR PMS PATIENTS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
8  111  37 A PILOT STUDY OF A HATHA YOGA TREATMENT FOR MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS. OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFICACY OF A YOGA TREATMENT FOR MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS. BOTH PHYSIOLOGIC AND SELF-REPORTED MEASURES OF HOT FLASHES WERE INCLUDED. METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE WITHIN-GROUP PILOT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED. PARTICIPANTS WERE 12 PERI- AND POST-MENOPAUSAL WOMEN EXPERIENCING AT LEAST 4 MENOPAUSAL HOT FLASHES PER DAY, AT LEAST 4 DAYS PER WEEK. ASSESSMENTS WERE ADMINISTERED BEFORE AND AFTER COMPLETION OF A 10-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM. PRE- AND POST-TREATMENT MEASURES INCLUDED: SEVERITY OF QUESTIONNAIRE-RATED MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS (WIKLUND SYMPTOM CHECK LIST), FREQUENCY, DURATION, AND SEVERITY OF HOT FLASHES (24-H AMBULATORY SKIN-CONDUCTANCE MONITORING; HOT-FLASH DIARY), INTERFERENCE OF HOT FLASHES WITH DAILY LIFE (HOT FLASH RELATED DAILY INTERFERENCE SCALE), AND SUBJECTIVE SLEEP QUALITY (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX). YOGA CLASSES INCLUDED BREATHING TECHNIQUES, POSTURES, AND RELAXATION POSES DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS. PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO PRACTICE AT HOME 15 MIN EACH DAY IN ADDITION TO WEEKLY CLASSES. RESULTS: ELEVEN WOMEN COMPLETED THE STUDY AND ATTENDED A MEAN OF 7.45 (S.D. 1.63) CLASSES. SIGNIFICANT PRE- TO POST-TREATMENT IMPROVEMENTS WERE FOUND FOR SEVERITY OF QUESTIONNAIRE-RATED TOTAL MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS, HOT-FLASH DAILY INTERFERENCE; AND SLEEP EFFICIENCY, DISTURBANCES, AND QUALITY. NEITHER 24-H MONITORING NOR ACCOMPANYING DIARIES YIELDED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN HOT FLASHES. CONCLUSIONS: THE YOGA TREATMENT AND STUDY PROCEDURES WERE FEASIBLE FOR MIDLIFE WOMEN. IMPROVEMENT IN SYMPTOM PERCEPTIONS AND WELL BEING WARRANT FURTHER STUDY OF YOGA FOR MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS, WITH A LARGER NUMBER OF WOMEN AND INCLUDING A CONTROL GROUP.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
9 2623  26 YOGA FOR SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT IN ONCOLOGY: A REVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE BASE AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS FOR RESEARCH. BECAUSE YOGA IS INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED AS A COMPLEMENTARY APPROACH TO CANCER SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT, PATIENTS/SURVIVORS AND PROVIDERS NEED TO UNDERSTAND ITS POTENTIAL BENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS BOTH DURING AND AFTER TREATMENT. THE AUTHORS REVIEWED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) OF YOGA CONDUCTED AT THESE POINTS IN THE CANCER CONTINUUM (N = 29; N = 13 DURING TREATMENT, N = 12 POST-TREATMENT, AND N = 4 WITH MIXED SAMPLES). FINDINGS BOTH DURING AND AFTER TREATMENT DEMONSTRATED THE EFFICACY OF YOGA TO IMPROVE OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), WITH IMPROVEMENT IN SUBDOMAINS OF QOL VARYING ACROSS STUDIES. FATIGUE WAS THE MOST COMMONLY MEASURED OUTCOME, AND MOST RCTS CONDUCTED DURING OR AFTER CANCER TREATMENT REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN FATIGUE. RESULTS ALSO SUGGESTED THAT YOGA CAN IMPROVE STRESS/DISTRESS DURING TREATMENT AND POST-TREATMENT DISTURBANCES IN SLEEP AND COGNITION. SEVERAL RCTS PROVIDED EVIDENCE THAT YOGA MAY IMPROVE BIOMARKERS OF STRESS, INFLAMMATION, AND IMMUNE FUNCTION. OUTCOMES WITH LIMITED OR MIXED FINDINGS (EG, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, PAIN, CANCER-SPECIFIC SYMPTOMS, SUCH AS LYMPHEDEMA) AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES (SUCH AS BENEFIT-FINDING AND LIFE SATISFACTION) WARRANT FURTHER STUDY. IMPORTANT FUTURE DIRECTIONS FOR YOGA RESEARCH IN ONCOLOGY INCLUDE: ENROLLING PARTICIPANTS WITH CANCER TYPES OTHER THAN BREAST, STANDARDIZING SELF-REPORT ASSESSMENTS, INCREASING THE USE OF ACTIVE CONTROL GROUPS AND OBJECTIVE MEASURES, AND ADDRESSING THE HETEROGENEITY OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS, WHICH VARY IN TYPE, KEY COMPONENTS (MOVEMENT, MEDITATION, BREATHING), DOSE, AND DELIVERY MODE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
10  694  30 EFFECT OF EISCHENS YOGA DURING RADIATION THERAPY ON PROSTATE CANCER PATIENT SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE: A RANDOMIZED PHASE II TRIAL. PURPOSE: A RANDOMIZED PHASE II STUDY WAS PERFORMED TO MEASURE THE POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF YOGA ON FATIGUE, ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION, URINARY INCONTINENCE, AND OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) IN PROSTATE CANCER (PCA) PATIENTS UNDERGOING EXTERNAL BEAM RADIATION THERAPY (RT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: THE PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA AND NO-YOGA COHORTS (1:1). TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA INTERVENTIONS WERE OFFERED THROUGHOUT THE 6- TO 9-WEEK COURSES OF RT. COMPARISONS OF STANDARDIZED ASSESSMENTS WERE PERFORMED BETWEEN THE 2 COHORTS FOR THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT OF FATIGUE AND THE SECONDARY ENDPOINTS OF ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION, URINARY INCONTINENCE, AND QOL BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER RT. RESULTS: FROM OCTOBER 2014 TO JANUARY 2016, 68 ELIGIBLE PCA PATIENTS UNDERWENT INFORMED CONSENT AND AGREED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY. OF THE 68 PATIENTS, 18 WITHDREW EARLY, MOSTLY BECAUSE OF TREATMENT SCHEDULE-RELATED TIME CONSTRAINTS, RESULTING IN 22 AND 28 PATIENTS IN THE YOGA AND NO-YOGA GROUPS, RESPECTIVELY. THROUGHOUT TREATMENT, THOSE IN THE YOGA ARM REPORTED LESS FATIGUE THAN THOSE IN THE CONTROL ARM, WITH GLOBAL FATIGUE, EFFECT OF FATIGUE, AND SEVERITY OF FATIGUE SUBSCALES SHOWING STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INTERACTIONS (P<.0001). THE SEXUAL HEALTH SCORES (INTERNATIONAL INDEX OF ERECTILE FUNCTION QUESTIONNAIRE) ALSO DISPLAYED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION (P=.0333). THE INTERNATIONAL PROSTATE SYMPTOM SCORE REVEALED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF TIME (P<.0001) BUT NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF TREATMENT (P=.1022). THE QOL MEASURES HAD MIXED RESULTS, WITH YOGA HAVING A SIGNIFICANT TIME BY TREATMENT EFFECT ON THE EMOTIONAL, PHYSICAL, AND SOCIAL SCORES BUT NOT ON FUNCTIONAL SCORES. CONCLUSIONS: A STRUCTURED YOGA INTERVENTION OF TWICE-WEEKLY CLASSES DURING A COURSE OF RT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PRE-EXISTING AND RT-RELATED FATIGUE AND URINARY AND SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION IN PCA PATIENTS.	2017	
                                                                                                           
11 1068  35 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS AND SLEEP QUALITY ACROSS MENOPAUSE STATUSES: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS AND SLEEP QUALITY ACROSS MENOPAUSE STATUSES. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER THE INTERVENTION OR CONTROL GROUP (N = 104 EACH), AND THOSE IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP PRACTICED YOGA FOR 20 WEEKS. THE PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONNAIRES: THE DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND STRESS SCALE; MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALE OF PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT; MENOPAUSE RATING SCALE; AND PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX. THE RESULTS REVEALED THAT YOGA EFFECTIVELY DECREASED MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS, WITH THE STRONGEST EFFECTS NOTED IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN (MEAN +/- STANDARD DEVIATION: 14.98 +/- 7.10), FOLLOWED BY PERIMENOPAUSAL WOMEN (6.11 +/- 2.07). YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED SLEEP QUALITY IN POSTMENOPAUSAL AND PERIMENOPAUSAL WOMEN AFTER CONTROLLING FOR SOCIAL SUPPORT, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, STRESS, AND MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS (P < 0.001). HOWEVER, YOGA DID NOT AFFECT SLEEP QUALITY IN PREMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. OVERALL SLEEP QUALITY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED IN POSTMENOPAUSAL AND PERIMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. OUR DATA INDICATE THAT YOGA CAN HELP DECREASE MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS, PARTICULARLY IN PERIMENOPAUSAL AND POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN, AND IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
12 2303  41 TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA ON PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME. BACKGROUND: EIGHTY PERCENT OF WOMEN DURING THEIR REPRODUCTIVE AGE EXPERIENCE SOME SYMPTOMS ATTRIBUTED TO PREMENSTRUAL PHASE OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE. PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME (PMS) IS CHARACTERIZED BY EMOTIONAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS THAT OCCUR DURING LATE LUTEAL PHASE OF MENSTRUAL CYCLE AND ARE RELIEVED AFTER THE ONSET OF MENSTRUATION. AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA ARE ONE OF THE WAYS TO REDUCE THESE SYMPTOMS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA ON PMS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 72 PARTICIPANTS OF PMS, REFERRED FOR PHYSIOTHERAPY TREATMENT (MEAN AGE 28 YEARS), WERE ENROLLED AND ALLOCATED INTO TWO GROUPS (GROUP A AND B) BY SIMPLE COMPUTERIZED RANDOMIZATION. PATIENTS IN GROUP A RECEIVED AEROBIC EXERCISE AND IN GROUP B RECEIVED YOGA MOVEMENTS FOR 40 MIN, 3 TIMES A WEEK FOR 1 MONTH. THE PAIN INTENSITY (VISUAL ANALOG SCALE) AND PMS SCALE WERE MEASURED BEFORE, AT THE END OF 15 DAYS, AND 1 MONTH OF TREATMENT PROGRAM. RESULTS: DATA WERE ANALYZED BY PAIRED T-TEST, UNPAIRED T-TEST, AND ONE-WAY ANOVA; AND THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT BOTH AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA MOVEMENTS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED PAIN INTENSITY AND PMS SYMPTOMS. SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PMS SYMPTOMS WAS FOUND IN PATIENTS TREATED WITH YOGA COMPARED TO AEROBIC EXERCISE; HOWEVER, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND IN PAIN INTENSITY BETWEEN THESE TWO GROUPS (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: IT IS CONCLUDED THAT BOTH AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA MOVEMENTS ARE EFFECTIVE IN TREATING PMS; HOWEVER, YOGA IS MORE EFFECTIVE IN RELIEVING THE SYMPTOMS OF PMS THAN AEROBIC EXERCISE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
13 1460  35 INFLUENCE OF YOGA ON CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE AND ON MEDIATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CHANGES IN SLEEP AND CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE: A NATIONWIDE, MULTICENTER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA IN CANCER SURVIVORS. BACKGROUND: CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (CRF) OFTEN CO-OCCURS WITH SLEEP DISTURBANCE AND IS ONE OF THE MOST PERVASIVE TOXICITIES RESULTING FROM CANCER AND ITS TREATMENT. WE AND OTHER INVESTIGATORS HAVE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THAT YOGA THERAPY CAN IMPROVE SLEEP QUALITY IN CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS. NO NATIONWIDE MULTICENTER PHASE III RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) HAS INVESTIGATED WHETHER YOGA THERAPY IMPROVES CRF OR WHETHER IMPROVEMENTS IN SLEEP MEDIATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON CRF. WE EXAMINED THE EFFECT OF A STANDARDIZED, 4-WEEK, YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM (YOGA FOR CANCER SURVIVORS [YOCAS]) ON CRF AND WHETHER YOCAS-INDUCED CHANGES IN SLEEP MEDIATED CHANGES IN CRF AMONG SURVIVORS. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: FOUR HUNDRED TEN CANCER SURVIVORS WERE RECRUITED TO A NATIONWIDE MULTICENTER PHASE III RCT COMPARING THE EFFECT OF YOCAS TO STANDARD SURVIVORSHIP CARE ON CRF AND EXAMINING THE MEDIATING EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN SLEEP, STEMMING FROM YOGA, ON CHANGES IN CRF. CRF WAS ASSESSED BY THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL FATIGUE SYMPTOM INVENTORY. SLEEP WAS ASSESSED VIA THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX. BETWEEN- AND WITHIN-GROUP INTERVENTION EFFECTS ON CRF WERE ASSESSED BY ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE AND 2-TAILED T TEST, RESPECTIVELY. PATH ANALYSIS WAS USED TO EVALUATE MEDIATION. RESULTS: YOCAS PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN CRF COMPARED WITH PARTICIPANTS IN STANDARD SURVIVORSHIP CARE AT POST-INTERVENTION ( P < .01). IMPROVEMENTS IN OVERALL SLEEP QUALITY AND REDUCTIONS IN DAYTIME DYSFUNCTION (EG, EXCESSIVE NAPPING) RESULTING FROM YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY MEDIATED THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON CRF (22% AND 37%, RESPECTIVELY, BOTH P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: YOCAS IS EFFECTIVE FOR TREATING CRF AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS; 22% TO 37% OF THE IMPROVEMENTS IN CRF FROM YOGA THERAPY RESULT FROM IMPROVEMENTS IN SLEEP QUALITY AND DAYTIME DYSFUNCTION. ONCOLOGISTS SHOULD CONSIDER PRESCRIBING YOGA TO CANCER SURVIVORS FOR TREATING CRF AND SLEEP DISTURBANCE.	2019	

14 2729  27 YOGA OF AWARENESS PROGRAM FOR MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS: RESULTS FROM A RANDOMIZED TRIAL. GOAL OF WORK: BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS HAVE LIMITED OPTIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF HOT FLASHES AND RELATED SYMPTOMS. FURTHER, THERAPIES WIDELY USED TO PREVENT RECURRENCE IN SURVIVORS, SUCH AS TAMOXIFEN, TEND TO INDUCE OR EXACERBATE MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS. THE AIM OF THIS PRELIMINARY, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA INTERVENTION ON MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS IN A SAMPLE OF SURVIVORS OF EARLY-STAGE BREAST CANCER (STAGES IA-IIB). MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIRTY-SEVEN DISEASE-FREE WOMEN EXPERIENCING HOT FLASHES WERE RANDOMIZED TO THE 8-WEEK YOGA OF AWARENESS PROGRAM (GENTLE YOGA POSES, MEDITATION, AND BREATHING EXERCISES) OR TO WAIT-LIST CONTROL. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS DAILY REPORTS OF HOT FLASHES COLLECTED AT BASELINE, POSTTREATMENT, AND 3 MONTHS AFTER TREATMENT VIA AN INTERACTIVE TELEPHONE SYSTEM. DATA WERE ANALYZED BY INTENTION TO TREAT. MAIN RESULTS: AT POSTTREATMENT, WOMEN WHO RECEIVED THE YOGA PROGRAM SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENTS RELATIVE TO THE CONTROL CONDITION IN HOT-FLASH FREQUENCY, SEVERITY, AND TOTAL SCORES AND IN LEVELS OF JOINT PAIN, FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, SYMPTOM-RELATED BOTHER, AND VIGOR. AT 3 MONTHS FOLLOW-UP, PATIENTS MAINTAINED THEIR TREATMENT GAINS IN HOT FLASHES, JOINT PAIN, FATIGUE, SYMPTOM-RELATED BOTHER, AND VIGOR AND SHOWED ADDITIONAL SIGNIFICANT GAINS IN NEGATIVE MOOD, RELAXATION, AND ACCEPTANCE. CONCLUSIONS: THIS PILOT STUDY PROVIDES PROMISING SUPPORT FOR THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF A COMPREHENSIVE YOGA PROGRAM FOR HOT FLASHES AND OTHER MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS IN EARLY-STAGE BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
15 1650  36 MULTICENTER, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA FOR SLEEP QUALITY AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS. PURPOSE: THIRTY PERCENT TO 90% OF CANCER SURVIVORS REPORT IMPAIRED SLEEP QUALITY POST-TREATMENT, WHICH CAN BE SEVERE ENOUGH TO INCREASE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS EXERCISE, ARE RECOMMENDED IN CONJUNCTION WITH DRUGS AND COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF IMPAIRED SLEEP. PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT YOGA-A MIND-BODY PRACTICE AND FORM OF EXERCISE-MAY IMPROVE SLEEP AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS. THE PRIMARY AIM OF THIS RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF A STANDARDIZED YOGA INTERVENTION COMPARED WITH STANDARD CARE FOR IMPROVING GLOBAL SLEEP QUALITY (PRIMARY OUTCOME) AMONG POST-TREATMENT CANCER SURVIVORS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: IN ALL, 410 SURVIVORS SUFFERING FROM MODERATE OR GREATER SLEEP DISRUPTION BETWEEN 2 AND 24 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY, CHEMOTHERAPY, AND/OR RADIATION THERAPY WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO STANDARD CARE OR STANDARD CARE PLUS THE 4-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. THE YOGA INTERVENTION USED THE YOGA FOR CANCER SURVIVORS (YOCAS) PROGRAM CONSISTING OF PRANAYAMA (BREATHING EXERCISES), 16 GENTLE HATHA AND RESTORATIVE YOGA ASANAS (POSTURES), AND MEDITATION. PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED TWO 75-MINUTE SESSIONS PER WEEK. SLEEP QUALITY WAS ASSESSED BY USING THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX AND ACTIGRAPHY PRE- AND POSTINTERVENTION. RESULTS: IN ALL, 410 SURVIVORS WERE ACCRUED (96% FEMALE; MEAN AGE, 54 YEARS; 75% HAD BREAST CANCER). YOGA PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN GLOBAL SLEEP QUALITY AND, SECONDARILY, SUBJECTIVE SLEEP QUALITY, DAYTIME DYSFUNCTION, WAKE AFTER SLEEP ONSET, SLEEP EFFICIENCY, AND MEDICATION USE AT POSTINTERVENTION (ALL P </= .05) COMPARED WITH STANDARD CARE PARTICIPANTS. CONCLUSION: YOGA, SPECIFICALLY THE YOCAS PROGRAM, IS A USEFUL TREATMENT FOR IMPROVING SLEEP QUALITY AND REDUCING SLEEP MEDICATION USE AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
16 2093  27 THE EFFECT OF YOCAS(C)(R) YOGA FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS ON HORMONAL THERAPY. UP TO 50% OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS ON AROMATASE INHIBITOR THERAPY REPORT MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS SUCH AS JOINT AND MUSCLE PAIN, SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTING TREATMENT ADHERENCE AND DISCONTINUATION RATES. WE CONDUCTED A SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS OF A NATIONWIDE, MULTI-SITE, PHASE II/III RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED, CLINICAL TRIAL EXAMINING THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR IMPROVING MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS CURRENTLY RECEIVING HORMONE THERAPY (AROMATASE INHIBITORS [AI] OR TAMOXIFEN [TAM]). BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS CURRENTLY RECEIVING AI (N = 95) OR TAM (N = 72) WITH NO PARTICIPATION IN YOGA DURING THE PREVIOUS 3 MONTHS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO 2 ARMS: (1) STANDARD CARE MONITORING AND (2) STANDARD CARE PLUS THE 4-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION (2X/WEEK; 75 MIN/SESSION) AND INCLUDED IN THIS ANALYSIS. THE YOGA INTERVENTION UTILIZED THE UR YOGA FOR CANCER SURVIVORS (YOCAS(C)((R))) PROGRAM CONSISTING OF BREATHING EXERCISES, 18 GENTLE HATHA AND RESTORATIVE YOGA POSTURES, AND MEDITATION. MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS WERE ASSESSED PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION. AT BASELINE, AI USERS REPORTED HIGHER LEVELS OF GENERAL PAIN, MUSCLE ACHES, AND TOTAL PHYSICAL DISCOMFORT THAN TAM USERS (ALL P </= 0.05). AMONG ALL BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS ON HORMONAL THERAPY, PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP DEMONSTRATED GREATER REDUCTIONS IN MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS SUCH AS GENERAL PAIN, MUSCLE ACHES AND TOTAL PHYSICAL DISCOMFORT FROM PRE- TO POST-INTERVENTION THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (ALL P </= 0.05). THE SEVERITY OF MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS WAS HIGHER FOR AI USERS COMPARED TO TAM USERS. AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS ON HORMONE THERAPY, THE BRIEF COMMUNITY-BASED YOCAS(C)(R) INTERVENTION SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED GENERAL PAIN, MUSCLE ACHES, AND PHYSICAL DISCOMFORT.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
17 1746  32 PILOT EVALUATION OF AN IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM FOR BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. BACKGROUND: WITH CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENTS IN SCREENING UPTAKE AND ADJUVANT CANCER TREATMENTS, THE NUMBER OF CANADIAN WOMEN SURVIVING BREAST CANCER CONTINUES TO GROW. PRELIMINARY FINDINGS SUGGEST YOGA CAN IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS, BUT FEW STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON IYENGAR YOGA (IY). OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF IY ON QOL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING IN A SELECT SAMPLE OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. METHODS: BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS (N = 24) PARTICIPATING IN IY CLASSES COMPLETED A QUESTIONNAIRE MEASURING GENERIC AND DISEASE-SPECIFIC QOL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING, BEFORE AND AFTER THE 12-WEEK CLASSES. RESULTS: POSTPROGRAM QUESTIONNAIRES WERE COMPLETED BY 17 PARTICIPANTS (71%) WHO ATTENDED AN AVERAGE OF 78.9% OF THE IY SESSIONS. SEVERAL INDICATORS OF GENERIC QOL IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY, INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH (MEAN CHANGE, +4.2; P = .045), VITALITY (MEAN CHANGE, +4.9; P = .033), ROLE-EMOTIONAL (MEAN CHANGE, +6.4; P = .010), AND BODILY PAIN (MEAN CHANGE, +4.4; P = .024). OTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN QOL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING WERE MEANINGFUL BUT WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. FINDINGS WERE FURTHER SUBSTANTIATED BY PARTICIPANT'S EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM'S BENEFITS AND MOTIVATIONAL VALUE. CONCLUSION: IN THIS PILOT STUDY OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS PARTICIPATING IN IY, WE FOUND IMPROVEMENTS IN QOL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING. MOREOVER, POSITIVE PROGRAM EVALUATION AND MOTIVATIONAL PROFILE PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THE ACCEPTABILITY OF IY WITH BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS COMPARING IY TO USUAL CARE AND OTHER FORMS OF YOGA IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS ARE WARRANTED. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: NURSES MAY CONSIDER IY AS A POSSIBLE INTERVENTION STRATEGY TO HELP BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS IMPROVE THEIR QOL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
18 1865  29 RANDOMIZED PILOT TRIAL OF YOGA VERSUS STRENGTHENING EXERCISES IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WITH CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE. PURPOSE: FATIGUE IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON AND BOTHERSOME REFRACTORY SYMPTOMS EXPERIENCED BY CANCER SURVIVORS. MINDFUL EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS YOGA IMPROVE CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE; HOWEVER, STUDIES OF YOGA HAVE INCLUDED HETEROGENEOUS SURVIVORSHIP POPULATIONS, AND THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON FATIGUED SURVIVORS REMAINS UNCLEAR. METHODS: WE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED 34 EARLY-STAGE BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WITH CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (>/=4 ON A LIKERT SCALE FROM 1-10) WITHIN 1 YEAR FROM DIAGNOSIS TO A 12-WEEK INTERVENTION OF HOME-BASED YOGA VERSUS STRENGTHENING EXERCISES, BOTH PRESENTED ON A DVD. THE PRIMARY ENDPOINTS WERE FEASIBILITY AND CHANGES IN FATIGUE, AS MEASURED BY THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL FATIGUE SYMPTOM INVENTORY-SHORT FORM (MFSI-SF). SECONDARY ENDPOINT WAS QUALITY OF LIFE, ASSESSED BY THE FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CANCER THERAPIES-BREAST (FACT-B). RESULTS: WE INVITED 401 WOMEN TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY; 78 RESPONDED, AND WE ENROLLED 34. BOTH GROUPS HAD SIGNIFICANT WITHIN-GROUP IMPROVEMENT IN MULTIPLE DOMAINS OF THE FATIGUE AND QUALITY OF LIFE SCORES FROM BASELINE TO POST-INTERVENTION, AND THESE BENEFITS WERE MAINTAINED AT 3 MONTHS POST-INTERVENTION. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS IN FATIGUE OR QUALITY OF LIFE AT ANY ASSESSMENT TIME. SIMILARLY, THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS IN ADHERENCE TO THE EXERCISE INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: BOTH DVD-BASED YOGA AND STRENGTHENING EXERCISES DESIGNED FOR CANCER SURVIVORS MAY BE GOOD OPTIONS TO ADDRESS FATIGUE IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. BOTH HAVE REASONABLE UPTAKE, ARE CONVENIENT AND REPRODUCIBLE, AND MAY BE HELPFUL IN DECREASING FATIGUE AND IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE FIRST YEAR POST-DIAGNOSIS IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WITH CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
19  353  27 ASSESSMENT OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA, BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA: A RANDOMISED TRIAL. YOGA WHICH IS USED AS AN ADJUNCT TREATMENT FOR BRONCHIAL ASTHMA IS GAINING POPULARITY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA. 120 NON-SMOKING MALE AND FEMALE PATIENTS OF ASTHMA IN THE AGE GROUP OF 17-50 YEARS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS I.E. GROUP A (YOGA GROUP) AND GROUP B (CONTROL GROUP). ALL PATIENTS REMAINED ON THEIR PRESCRIBED MEDICATION, BUT GROUP A PATIENTS PRACTICED YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES FOR 8 WEEKS. ASTHMA QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE (AQLQ) AND DIARY RECORD WAS USED TO ASSESS QUALITY OF LIFE, NUMBER AND SEVERITY OF ASTHMATIC ATTACKS, AND THE DOSAGE OF THE MEDICATION REQUIRED AT BASELINE AND AFTER 8 WEEKS. GROUP A SUBJECTS SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN "SYMPTOMS", "ACTIVITIES" AND "ENVIRONMENTAL" DOMAINS OF AQLQ AT 8 WEEKS (P<0.01) AND SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DAILY NUMBER AND SEVERITY OF ATTACKS, AND THE DOSAGE OF MEDICATION REQUIRED AT 4 AND 8 WEEKS (P<0.01) COMPARED TO THE BASELINE. YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES USED ADJUNCTIVELY WITH STANDARD PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
20 2415  33 YOGA AND MEDITATION FOR MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS-A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS HAVE ONLY VERY LIMITED TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS TRIAL WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF A 12-WEEK TRADITIONAL HATHA YOGA AND MEDITATION INTERVENTION ON MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. METHODS: PATIENTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED EITHER TO A 12-WEEK YOGA AND MEDITATION INTERVENTION OR TO USUAL CARE. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS TOTAL MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS (MENOPAUSE RATING SCALE [MRS] TOTAL SCORE). SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED MRS SUBSCALES, QUALITY OF LIFE (FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CANCER THERAPY-BREAST), FATIGUE (FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CHRONIC ILLNESS THERAPY-FATIGUE), DEPRESSION, AND ANXIETY (HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE). OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED AT WEEK 12 AND WEEK 24 AFTER RANDOMIZATION. RESULTS: IN TOTAL, 40 WOMEN (MEAN AGE +/- STANDARD DEVIATION, 49.2 +/- 5.9 YEARS) WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA (N = 19) OR TO USUAL CARE (N = 21). WOMEN IN THE YOGA GROUP REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER TOTAL MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS COMPARED WITH THE USUAL CARE GROUP AT WEEK 12 (MEAN DIFFERENCE, -5.6; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, -9.2 TO -1.9; P = .004) AND AT WEEK 24 (MEAN DIFFERENCE, -4.5; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, -8.3 TO -0.7; P = .023). AT WEEK 12, THE YOGA GROUP REPORTED LESS SOMATOVEGETATIVE, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND UROGENITAL MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS; LESS FATIGUE; AND IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE (ALL P < .05). AT WEEK 24, ALL EFFECTS PERSISTED EXCEPT FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS. SHORT-TERM EFFECTS ON MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS REMAINED SIGNIFICANT WHEN ONLY WOMEN WHO WERE RECEIVING ANTIESTROGEN MEDICATION (N = 36) WERE ANALYZED. SIX MINOR ADVERSE EVENTS OCCURRED IN EACH GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA COMBINED WITH MEDITATION CAN BE CONSIDERED A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE COMPLEMENTARY INTERVENTION FOR MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. THE EFFECTS SEEM TO PERSIST FOR AT LEAST 3 MONTHS.	2015

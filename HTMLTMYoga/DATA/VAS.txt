1 2088 124 THE EFFECT OF PRACTICING YOGA DURING PREGNANCY ON LABOR STAGES LENGTH, ANXIETY AND PAIN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: ANXIETY AND FEAR OF LABOR PAIN HAS LED TO ELEVATED CESAREAN SECTION RATE IN SOME COUNTRIES. THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA IN PREGNANCY ON ANXIETY, LABOR PAIN AND LENGTH OF LABOR STAGES. METHODS: THIS CLINICAL TRIAL STUDY WAS PERFORMED ON 84 NULLIPAROUS WOMEN WHO WERE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OLD AND WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS OF YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS. PREGNANCY YOGA PROGRAM CONSISTING OF 6 60-MIN TRAINING SESSIONS WAS STARTED EVERY 2 WEEKS FROM WEEK 26 OF PREGNANCY AND CONTINUED UNTIL 37 WEEKS OF GESTATION. ANXIETY SEVERITY AT MATERNAL ADMISSION TO LABOR WAS MEASURED BY THE SPIELBERGERS STATE-TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY, AND LABOR PAIN WAS MEASURED BY VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS) AT DILATATION (4-5 CM) AND 2 H AFTER THE FIRST MEASUREMENT. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING CHI-SQUARE AND T-TEST. RESULTS: INTERVENTION GROUP REPORTED LESS PAIN AT DILATATION (4-5 CM) (P=0.001) AND 2 H AFTER THE FIRST MEASUREMENT (P=0.001) THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. STAT ANXIETY WAS ALSO LOWER IN INTERVENTION GROUP THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (P=0.003) AT THE ENTRANCE TO LABOR ROOM. SUBJECTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP REQUIRED MORE INDUCTION COMPARED TO INTERVENTION GROUP (P=0.003). WOMEN IN INTERVENTION GROUP EXPERIENCED SHORTER DURATION OF THE FIRST PHASE OF THE LABOR THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (P=0.002). ALSO, THE TOTAL DURATION OF TWO STAGES OF LABOR WAS SHORTER IN INTERVENTION GROUP THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: PRACTICING YOGA DURING PREGNANCY MAY REDUCE WOMEN'S ANXIETY DURING LABOR; SHORTEN LABOR STAGES, AND LOWER LABOR PAIN.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
2 2525  69 YOGA DURING PREGNANCY: THE EFFECTS ON LABOR PAIN AND DELIVERY OUTCOMES (A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL). OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF AN ANTENATAL YOGA PROGRAM ON PERCEIVED MATERNAL LABOR PAIN AND DELIVERY OUTCOMES. MATERIAL & METHODS: THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED WITH SIXTY PRIMIPAROUS WOMEN, AGED 18-35 YEARS OLD, WHO WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER AN ANTENATAL YOGA PROGRAM OR CONTROL GROUPS. LABOR PAIN AND DISCOMFORT LEVEL OF THE PARTICIPANTS WERE MEASURED USING A VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE AT CERVICAL DILATATION OF 3-4 C AND AT 2 AND 4 H AFTER THE INITIAL MEASUREMENT. DEMOGRAPHIC AND OBSTETRICAL INFORMATION WERE COLLECTED. THE ANTENATAL YOGA PROGRAM CONSISTED OF A 1-H SUPERVISED YOGA CLASS, THREE TIMES A WEEKLY, STARTING AT 26 WEEKS GESTATION. . RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS IN CONTROL GROUP REPORTED HIGHER PAIN INTENSITY COMPARED TO EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AT 3-4 CM OF DILATATION (P = 0.01) AND AT 2 H AFTER THE FIRST AND THE SECOND MEASUREMENTS (P = 0.000). MOTHERS IN THE ANTENATAL INTERVENTION GROUP THAT COMPLETED THE YOGA CLASS REQUIRED A DECREASED FREQUENCY OF LABOR INDUCTION IN COMPARISON WITH CONTROL GROUP (P = 0.008). IN ADDITION, MODE OF DELIVERY OF THE INTERVENTION GROUP RESULTED IN A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF CESAREAN SECTION THAN CONTROL GROUP (P = 0.002). LASTLY, THE INTERVENTION GROUP EXPERIENCED A SHORTER DURATION OF THE SECOND AND THIRD STAGES OF LABOR. INTERVAL LEVEL DATA WAS ANALYZED BY USING AN INDEPENDENT T-TEST AND CHI-SQUARE. CONCLUSION: YOGA DURING PREGNANCY MAY CONTRIBUTE TO A REDUCTION PAIN OF LABOR AND IMPROVED ADEQUACY OF CHILDBIRTH.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
3   90  35 A MODIFIED YOGA-BASED EXERCISE PROGRAM IN HEMODIALYSIS PATIENTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. AIM: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA-BASED EXERCISE PROGRAM ON PAIN, FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, AND BIOCHEMICAL MARKERS IN HEMODIALYSIS PATIENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IN 2004 A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS CARRIED OUT IN THE OUTPATIENT HEMODIALYSIS UNIT OF THE NEPHROLOGY DEPARTMENT, ULUDAG UNIVERSITY FACULTY OF MEDICINE. CLINICALLY STABLE HEMODIALYSIS PATIENTS (N=37) WERE INCLUDED AND FOLLOWED IN TWO GROUPS: THE MODIFIED YOGA-BASED EXERCISE GROUP (N=19) AND THE CONTROL GROUP (N=18). YOGA-BASED EXERCISES WERE DONE IN GROUPS FOR 30 MIN/DAY TWICE A WEEK FOR 3 MONTHS. ALL OF THE PATIENTS IN THE YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS WERE GIVEN AN ACTIVE RANGE OF MOTION EXERCISES TO DO FOR 10 MIN AT HOME. THE MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES WERE PAIN INTENSITY (MEASURED BY THE VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE, VAS), FATIGUE (VAS), SLEEP DISTURBANCE (VAS), AND GRIP STRENGTH (MMHG); BIOCHEMICAL VARIABLES-- UREA, CREATININE, CALCIUM, ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE, PHOSPHORUS, CHOLESTEROL, HDL-CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDE, ERYTHROCYTE, HEMATOCRIT--WERE EVALUATED. RESULTS: AFTER A 12-WEEK INTERVENTION, SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE SEEN IN THE VARIABLES: PAIN -37%, FATIGUE -55%, SLEEP DISTURBANCE -25%, GRIP STRENGTH +15%, UREA -29%, CREATININE -14%, ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE -15%, CHOLESTEROL -15%, ERYTHROCYTE +11%, AND HEMATOCRIT COUNT +13%; NO SIDE-EFFECTS WERE SEEN. IMPROVEMENT OF THE VARIABLES IN THE YOGA-BASED EXERCISE PROGRAM WAS FOUND TO BE SUPERIOR TO THAT IN THE CONTROL GROUP FOR ALL THE VARIABLES EXCEPT CALCIUM, PHOSPHORUS, HDL-CHOLESTEROL AND TRIGLYCERIDE LEVELS. CONCLUSION: A SIMPLIFIED YOGA-BASED REHABILITATION PROGRAM IS A COMPLEMENTARY, SAFE AND EFFECTIVE CLINICAL TREATMENT MODALITY IN PATIENTS WITH END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
4 2193  33 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA TRAINING AND A SINGLE BOUT OF YOGA ON DELAYED ONSET MUSCLE SORENESS IN THE LOWER EXTREMITY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA TRAINING AND A SINGLE BOUT OF YOGA ON THE INTENSITY OF DELAYED ONSET MUSCLE SORENESS (DOMS). 24 YOGA-TRAINED (YT; N = 12) AND NON-YOGA-TRAINED (CON; N = 12), MATCHED WOMEN VOLUNTEERS WERE ADMINISTERED A DOMS-INDUCING BENCH-STEPPING EXERCISE. MUSCLE SORENESS WAS ASSESSED AT BASELINE, 24, 48, 72, 96, AND 120 HOURS AFTER BENCH-STEPPING USING A VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS). GROUPS WERE ALSO COMPARED ON BODY AWARENESS (BA), FLEXIBILITY USING THE SIT-AND-REACH TEST (SR), AND PERCEIVED EXERTION (RPE). STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE WAS ACCEPTED AT P </= 0.05. A 2 X 2 MIXED FACTORIAL ANOVA WITH REPEATED MEASURES AT 24 AND 48 HOURS REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.05) GROUP MAIN EFFECT WITH VAS SCORES GREATER FOR CON THAN YT. PAIRED T-TESTS REVEALED THAT IN YT, VAS SCORES WERE HIGHER BEFORE YOGA CLASS THAN AFTER YOGA CLASS AT 24 HOURS (21.4 [+/- 6.9] MM VS. 11.1 [+/- 4.1] MM; P = 0.02). THE SR WAS GREATER IN YT THAN IN CON (65.0 [+/- 7.9] CM VS. 33.3 [+/- 7.0] CM; P < 0.01); HOWEVER, NO DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND BETWEEN YOGA AND CONTROL IN BA (94.0 [+/- 4.4] UNITS VS. 83.8 [+/- 3.7] UNITS; P = 0.21) OR IN RPE AT 5-MINUTE INTERVALS (2.9 [+/- 0.3], 5.3 [+/- 0.8], 5.8 [+/- 0.9], AND 5.2 [+/- 0.8] VS. 2.5 [+/- 0.3], 4.0 [+/- 0.5], 4.2 [+/- 0.3], AND 4.9 [+/- 0.4]. YOGA TRAINING AND A SINGLE BOUT OF YOGA APPEAR TO ATTENUATE PEAK MUSCLE SORENESS IN WOMEN FOLLOWING A BOUT OF ECCENTRIC EXERCISE. THESE FINDINGS HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR COACHES, ATHLETES, AND THE EXERCISING PUBLIC WHO MAY WANT TO IMPLEMENT YOGA TRAINING AS A PRESEASON REGIMEN OR SUPPLEMENTAL ACTIVITY TO LESSEN THE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH MUSCLE SORENESS.	2004	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
5 1039  36 EFFECTS OF YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION - A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. BACKGROUND: PATIENTS WITH ATRIAL FIBRILLATION OFTEN HAVE AN IMPAIRED QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). PRACTISING YOGA MAY DECREASE STRESS AND HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER YOGA CAN IMPROVE QOL AND DECREASE BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEART RATE IN PATIENTS WITH PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (PAF). METHODS: IN THIS PILOT STUDY, 80 PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH PAF WERE RANDOMIZED TO STANDARD TREATMENT (CONTROL GROUP, N=40) OR STANDARD TREATMENT IN COMBINATION WITH YOGA (YOGA GROUP, N=40) DURING A 12-WEEK PERIOD. QOL, BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEART RATE WERE EVALUATED AT BASELINE AND AT THE END OF THE STUDY (12 (+2) WEEKS). EUROQOL-5D (EQ-5D) VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS) AND THE TWO DIMENSIONS IN SHORT-FORM HEALTH SURVEY (SF-36) WERE USED TO EVALUATE QOL. RESULTS: AT BASELINE THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN QOL BETWEEN THE GROUPS IN EQ-5D VAS- SCALE ( P=0.02) AND SF-36 MENTAL HEALTH SCORE ( P<0.001) IN WHICH THE CONTROL GROUP HAD HIGHER SCORES. AT THE END OF THE STUDY, THE YOGA GROUP AVERAGED HIGHER SF-36 MENTAL HEALTH SCORES. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS ( P=0.016), BUT NO DIFFERENCES IN EQ-5D VAS- SCALE AND PHYSIOLOGICAL HEALTH SCORE WAS SEEN BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. AT THE END OF THE STUDY, THE YOGA GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER HEART RATE ( P=0.024) AND SYSTOLIC ( P=0.033) AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE ( P<0.001) COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA WITH LIGHT MOVEMENTS AND DEEP BREATHING MAY LEAD TO IMPROVED QOL, LOWER BLOOD PRESSURE AND LOWER HEART RATE IN PATIENTS WITH PAF COMPARED TO A CONTROL GROUP. YOGA COULD BE A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT METHOD TO STANDARD THERAPY.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
6  688  56 EFFECT OF ANTENATAL EXERCISES, INCLUDING YOGA, ON THE COURSE OF LABOR, DELIVERY AND PREGNANCY: A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY. BACKGROUND: DELIVERING A CHILD IS A VERY STRESSFUL EXPERIENCE FOR WOMEN. PREGNANCY AND LABOR ENTAIL COMPLEX EVENTS THAT ARE UNIQUE TO EACH INDIVIDUAL FEMALE. THE MANAGEMENT OF LABOR PAIN IS OFTEN DONE USING ANALGESICS AND ANESTHESIA, WHICH HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE SOME SIDE EFFECTS. MORE COMPREHENSIVE DATA ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE FOR CLINICIANS TO CONFIDENTLY PRESCRIBE EXERCISES TO PATIENTS. THIS STUDY WAS DONE TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF ANTENATAL EXERCISES, INCLUDING YOGA, ON THE COURSE OF LABOR, DELIVERY, AND PREGNANCY OUTCOMES. METHODS: A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AMONG 200 PRIMIPAROUS SUBJECTS (AGED 20-40). A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS PROVIDED TO THE SUBJECTS TO OBTAIN THEIR DEMOGRAPHIC AND OBSTETRICAL INFORMATION 6 WEEKS AFTER DELIVERY, AND THEIR HOSPITAL RECORDS WERE ALSO ASSESSED FOR FURTHER DETAILS. BASED ON THE NATURE AND DETAILS OBTAINED FOR THE ANTENATAL EXERCISES, SUBJECTS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: CONTROL AND EXERCISE. OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED THE NEED FOR LABOR INDUCTION, SELF-PERCEIVED PAIN AND PERCEIVED EXERTION DURING LABOR, DURATION AND NATURE OF THE DELIVERY, NEWBORN INFANT WEIGHT, MATERNAL WEIGHT GAIN, HISTORY OF BACK PAIN, AND POST-PARTUM RECOVERY. THE TOTAL MATERNAL WEIGHT GAIN (IN KILOGRAMS) WAS CALCULATED FROM WEIGHT AT 6 WEEKS AFTER DELIVERY MINUS THE WEIGHT AT 12-14 WEEKS OF GESTATION. BACK PAIN DURING PREGNANCY AND SELF-PERCEIVED LABOR PAIN WERE MEASURED USING A VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS). THE OVERALL PERCEIVED EXERTION DURING LABOR WAS MEASURED USING AN ADAPTED BORG SCALE FOR PERCEIVED EFFORT. RESULTS: THE SUBJECTS WHO FOLLOWED REGULAR ANTENATAL EXERCISES, INCLUDING YOGA, HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER RATES OF CESAREAN SECTION, LOWER WEIGHT GAIN, HIGHER NEWBORN INFANT WEIGHT, LOWER PAIN AND OVERALL DISCOMFORT DURING LABOR, LOWER BACK PAIN THROUGHOUT PREGNANCY, AND EARLIER POST-PARTUM RECOVERY COMPARED TO THOSE WHO DID NO SPECIFIC EXERCISES OR ONLY WALKED DURING PREGNANCY. CONCLUSIONS: THIS RETROSPECTIVE STUDY SHOWED THAT REGULAR ANTENATAL EXERCISES, INCLUDING YOGA, RESULT IN BETTER OUTCOMES RELATED TO THE COURSE OF LABOR, DELIVERY, AND PREGNANCY. THESE RESULTS NOTABLY INDICATED THAT PREGNANT WOMEN SHOULD BE ACTIVE THROUGHOUT PREGNANCY AND FOLLOW A SUPERVISED EXERCISE PROGRAM THAT INCLUDES YOGA UNLESS CONTRAINDICATED. WE REQUIRE FURTHER LARGE-SCALE PROSPECTIVE STUDIES AND QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL TRIALS TO CONFIRM THE OBSERVED FINDINGS.	2020	

7 2189  33 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND DEPRESSION IN ELDERLY BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER. DESIGN: TWENTY PATIENTS (10 WERE IN YOGA PROGRAM, 10 WERE IN EXERCISE GROUP) BETWEEN 65 AND 70 YEARS OF AGE UNDER GOING TREATMENT FOR CANCER WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PATIENTS WERE RECORDED AND GENERAL PHYSIOTHERAPY ASSESSMENTS PERFORMED. EIGHT SESSIONS OF A CLASSICAL YOGA PROGRAM INCLUDING WARMING AND BREATHING EXERCISES, ASANAS, RELAXATION IN SUPINE POSITION, AND MEDITATION AND 8 SESSIONS OF CLASSICAL EXERCISE PROGRAM WERE APPLIED TO PARTICIPANTS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA AND EXERCISE PROGRAM, QUALITY OF LIFE ASSESSMENTS FOR THE PATIENTS WERE CONDUCTED USING THE NOTTINGHAM HEALTH PROFILE (NHP). PATIENTS' DEPRESSION LEVELS WERE ASSESSED USING THE BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY. THEIR LEVEL OF PAIN, FATIGUE AND SLEEP QUALITY WAS EVALUATED USING THE VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS). RESULTS: IT WAS FOUND THAT ALL PATIENTS' QUALITY OF LIFE SCORES AFTER THE YOGA AND EXERCISE PROGRAM WERE BETTER THAN SCORES OBTAINED BEFORE THE YOGA AND EXERCISE PROGRAM (P < 0.05). WHEN THE POST TREATMENT DATA OF THE GROUPS WERE COMPARED IN TERMS OF NHP AND SUBCATEGORIES, ER, SI, S, PA AND THE TOTAL SCORES OF NHP WERE FOUND SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT IN FAVOR OF GROUP I (P < 0.05). HOWEVER EL AND P SCORES OF THE NHP WERE NOT DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE GROUPS (P > 0.05). WHEN THE GROUPS WERE COMPARED IN TERMS OF DEPRESSION, PAIN, FATIGUE, AND SLEEP QUALITY, STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND IN ALL PARAMETERS BETWEEN PRE AND POST TREATMENT VALUES FOR BOTH GROUPS (P < 0.05). WHEN THE POST-TREATMENT VALUES OF THE GROUPS WERE COMPARED, FATIGUE AND SLEEP QUALITY WERE FOUND STATISTICALLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE GROUPS IN FAVOR OF GROUP I (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT YOGA IS VALUABLE IN HELPING TO DIMINISH DEPRESSION, PAIN, FATIGUE AND HELPS CANCER PATIENTS TO PERFORM DAILY AND ROUTINE ACTIVITIES, AND INCREASES THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
8 2845  33 YOGA, EURYTHMY THERAPY AND STANDARD PHYSIOTHERAPY (YES-TRIAL) FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC NON-SPECIFIC LOW BACK PAIN: A THREE-ARMED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. WE AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND EURYTHMY THERAPY COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL PHYSIOTHERAPY EXERCISES IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. IN A THREE-ARMED, MULTICENTRE, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN WERE TREATED FOR 8 WEEKS IN GROUP SESSIONS (75 MINUTES ONCE PER WEEK). PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS PATIENTS' PHYSICAL DISABILITY (MEASURED BY RMDQ) FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 8. SECONDARY OUTCOME VARIABLES WERE PAIN INTENSITY AND PAIN-RELATED BOTHERSOMENESS (VAS), HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (SF-12) AND LIFE SATISFACTION (BMLSS). OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE, AFTER THE INTERVENTION AT 8 WEEKS AND AT A 16-WEEK FOLLOW UP. DATA OF 274 PARTICIPANTS WERE USED FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSES. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE THREE GROUPS FOR THE PRIMARY AND ALL SECONDARY OUTCOMES. IN ALL GROUPS, RMDQ DECREASED COMPARABLY AT 8 WEEKS, BUT DID NOT REACH CLINICAL MEANINGFULNESS. PAIN INTENSITY AND PAIN-RELATED BOTHERSOMENESS DECREASED, WHILE QUALITY OF LIFE INCREASED IN ALL 3 GROUPS. IN EXPLORATIVE GENERAL LINEAR MODELS FOR THE SF-12'S MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENT PARTICIPANTS IN THE EURYTHMY ARM BENEFITTED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE COMPARED TO PHYSIOTHERAPY AND YOGA. FURTHERMORE, WITHIN-GROUP ANALYSES SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS OF SF-12 MENTAL SCORE FOR YOGA AND EURYTHMY THERAPY ONLY. ALL INTERVENTIONS WERE SAFE. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTER: DRKS-ID: DRKS00004651 PERSPECTIVE: THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A MULTICENTRE THREE-ARMED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTS OF THREE 8-WEEK PROGRAMS IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. COMPARED TO THE 'GOLD STANDARD' OF CONVENTIONAL PHYSIOTHERAPEUTIC EXERCISES, EURYTHMY THERAPY AND YOGA THERAPY LEAD TO COMPARABLE SYMPTOMATIC IMPROVEMENTS IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. HOWEVER, THE WITHIN-GROUP EFFECT SIZES WERE SMALL TO MODERATE AND DID NOT REACH CLINICAL MEANINGFULNESS ON PATIENTS' PHYSICAL DISABILITY (RMDQ).	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
9 1870  35 RANDOMIZED-CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING YOGA AND HOME-BASED EXERCISE FOR CHRONIC NECK PAIN. OBJECTIVES: CHRONIC NECK PAIN IS A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM WITH ONLY VERY FEW EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT OPTIONS. THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE FOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR RELIEVING MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF IYENGAR YOGA COMPARED WITH EXERCISE ON CHRONIC NONSPECIFIC NECK PAIN. METHODS: PATIENTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER YOGA OR EXERCISE. THE YOGA GROUP ATTENDED A 9-WEEK YOGA COURSE AND THE EXERCISE GROUP RECEIVED A SELF-CARE MANUAL ON HOME-BASED EXERCISES FOR NECK PAIN RELIEF. THE MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE WAS THE PRESENT NECK PAIN INTENSITY (100 MM VISUAL ANALOG SCALE). SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY (NECK DISABILITY INDEX), PAIN AT MOTION (VISUAL ANALOG SCALE), HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (SHORT FORM-36 QUESTIONNAIRE), CERVICAL RANGE OF MOTION, PROPRIOCEPTIVE ACUITY, AND PRESSURE PAIN THRESHOLD. RESULTS: FIFTY-ONE PATIENTS (MEAN AGE 47.8 Y ; 82.4% FEMALE) WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA (N=25) AND EXERCISE (N=26) INTERVENTION. AFTER THE STUDY PERIOD, PATIENTS IN THE YOGA GROUP REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY LESS NECK PAIN INTENSITY COMPARED WITH THE EXERCISE GROUP [MEAN DIFFERENCE: -13.9 MM (95% CI, -26.4 TO -1.4), P=0.03]. THE YOGA GROUP REPORTED LESS DISABILITY AND BETTER MENTAL QUALITY OF LIFE. RANGE OF MOTION AND PROPRIOCEPTIVE ACUITY WERE IMPROVED AND THE PRESSURE PAIN THRESHOLD WAS ELEVATED IN THE YOGA GROUP. DISCUSSION: YOGA WAS MORE EFFECTIVE IN RELIEVING CHRONIC NONSPECIFIC NECK PAIN THAN A HOME-BASED EXERCISE PROGRAM. YOGA REDUCED NECK PAIN INTENSITY AND DISABILITY AND IMPROVED HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE. MOREOVER, YOGA SEEMS TO INFLUENCE THE FUNCTIONAL STATUS OF NECK MUSCLES, AS INDICATED BY IMPROVEMENT OF PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES OF NECK PAIN.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
10  835  33 EFFECT OF YOGA ON PAIN, BRAIN-DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR, AND SEROTONIN IN PREMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. BACKGROUND. SEROTONIN AND BRAIN-DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR (BDNF) ARE KNOWN TO BE MODULATORS OF NOCICEPTION. HOWEVER, PAIN-RELATED CONNECTION BETWEEN YOGA AND THOSE NEUROMODULATORS HAS NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED. THEREFORE, WE AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON PAIN, BDNF, AND SEROTONIN. METHODS. PREMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN PRACTICED YOGA THREE TIMES A WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS. AT BASELINE AND AFTER 12 WEEKS, BACK PAIN INTENSITY WAS MEASURED USING VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS), AND SERUM BDNF AND SEROTONIN LEVELS WERE EVALUATED. ADDITIONALLY, BACK FLEXIBILITY AND LEVEL OF DEPRESSION WERE ASSESSED. RESULTS. AFTER 12-WEEK YOGA, VAS DECREASED IN THE YOGA GROUP (P < 0.001), WHEREAS IT INCREASED (P < 0.05) IN THE CONTROL GROUP. BACK FLEXIBILITY WAS IMPROVED IN THE YOGA GROUP (P < 0.01). SERUM BDNF INCREASED IN THE YOGA GROUP (P < 0.01), WHEREAS IT TENDED TO DECREASE IN THE CONTROL GROUP (P = 0.05). SERUM SEROTONIN MAINTAINED IN THE YOGA GROUP, WHILE IT REDUCED (P < 0.01) IN THE CONTROL GROUP. THE DEPRESSION LEVEL MAINTAINED IN THE YOGA GROUP, WHEREAS IT TENDED TO INCREASE IN THE CONTROL GROUP (P = 0.07). CONCLUSIONS. WE PROPOSE THAT BDNF MAY BE ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS MEDIATING BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
11 2562  35 YOGA FOR CHRONIC NECK PAIN: A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL. UNLABELLED: YOGA HAS BEEN FOUND EFFECTIVE IN THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. WE AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF IYENGAR YOGA IN CHRONIC NECK PAIN BY MEANS OF A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. SEVENTY-SEVEN PATIENTS (AGED 47.9 +/- 7.9, 67 FEMALE) WITH CHRONIC NECK PAIN WHO SCORED >40 MM ON A 100-MM VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS) WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 9-WEEK IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM WITH WEEKLY 90-MINUTE CLASSES (N = 38) OR TO A SELF-CARE/EXERCISE PROGRAM (N = 38). PATIENTS WERE EXAMINED AT BASELINE AND AFTER 4 AND 10 WEEKS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS CHANGE OF MEAN PAIN AT REST (VAS) FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 10. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED PAIN AT MOTION, FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), AND PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES. TWELVE PATIENTS IN THE YOGA GROUP AND 11 PATIENTS IN THE SELF-CARE/EXERCISE GROUP WERE LOST TO FOLLOW-UP, WITH HIGHER STUDY NONADHERENCE IN THE SELF-CARE GROUP (5 VERSUS 10 PATIENTS). MEAN PAIN AT REST WAS REDUCED FROM 44.3 +/- 20.1 TO 13.0 +/- 11.6 AT WEEK 10 BY YOGA AND FROM 41.9 +/- 21.9 TO 34.4 +/- 21.1 BY SELF-CARE/EXERCISE (GROUP DIFFERENCE: -20.1, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL: -30.0, -10.1; P < .001). PAIN AT MOTION WAS REDUCED FROM 53.4 +/- 18.5 TO 22.4 +/- 18.7 AT WEEK 10 BY YOGA AND FROM 49.4 +/- 22.8 TO 39.9 +/- 21.5 BY SELF-CARE/EXERCISE (GROUP DIFFERENCE: -18.7, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL: -29.3, -8.1; P < .001). SIGNIFICANT TREATMENT EFFECTS OF YOGA WERE ALSO FOUND FOR PAIN-RELATED APPREHENSION, DISABILITY, QOL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES. SENSITIVITY ANALYSES SUGGESTED MINIMAL INFLUENCE OF DROPOUT RATES. BOTH PROGRAMS WERE WELL TOLERATED. IN THIS PRELIMINARY TRIAL, YOGA APPEARS TO BE AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT IN CHRONIC NECK PAIN WITH POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL EFFECTS ON PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING AND QOL. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN CHRONIC NECK PAIN SHOULD BE FURTHER TESTED BY COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS STUDIES WITH LONGER OBSERVATION PERIODS. PERSPECTIVE: THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTS OF A 9-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM OR SELF-CARE EXERCISE IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC NECK PAIN. YOGA LED TO SUPERIOR PAIN RELIEF AND FUNCTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS AND MIGHT BE A USEFUL TREATMENT OPTION FOR CHRONIC NECK PAIN.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
12 1024  37 EFFECTS OF YOGA AND THE ADDITION OF TUI NA IN PATIENTS WITH FIBROMYALGIA. OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY AIMED TO VERIFY WHETHER TECHNIQUES OF YOGA WITH AND WITHOUT THE ADDITION OF TUI NA MIGHT IMPROVE PAIN AND THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF FIBROMYALGIA (FMS) ON PATIENTS' DAILY LIFE. DESIGN: FORTY (40) FMS WOMEN WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS, RELAXING YOGA (RY) AND RELAXING YOGA PLUS TOUCH (RYT), FOR EIGHT WEEKLY SESSIONS OF STRETCHING, BREATHING, AND RELAXING YOGIC TECHNIQUES. RYT PATIENTS WERE FURTHER SUBMITTED TO MANIPULATIVE TECHNIQUES OF TUI NA. OUTCOME MEASURE: OUTCOME MEASURES COMPRISED THE FIBROMYALGIA IMPACT QUESTIONNAIRE (FIQ), PAIN THRESHOLD AT THE 18 FMS TENDER POINTS, AND A VERBAL GRADUATION OF PAIN ASSESSED BEFORE TREATMENT AND ON THE FOLLOWUP. THE VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS) FOR PAIN WAS ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER EACH SESSION AND ON THE FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: SEVENTEEN (17) RYT AND 16 RY PATIENTS COMPLETED THE STUDY. BOTH RY AND RYT GROUPS SHOWED IMPROVEMENT IN THE FIQ AND VAS SCORES, WHICH DECREASED ON ALL SESSIONS. THE RYT GROUP SHOWED LOWER VAS AND VERBAL SCORES FOR PAIN ON THE EIGHTH SESSION, BUT THIS DIFFERENCE WAS NOT MAINTAINED ON THE FOLLOW-UP. CONVERSELY, RY VAS AND VERBAL SCORES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER JUST ON THE FOLLOW-UP. CONCLUSIONS: THESE STUDY RESULTS SHOWED THAT YOGIC TECHNIQUES ARE VALID THERAPEUTIC METHODS FOR FMS. TOUCH ADDITION YIELDED GREATER IMPROVEMENT DURING THE TREATMENT. OVER TIME, HOWEVER, RY PATIENTS REPORTED LESS PAIN THAN RYT. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT A PASSIVE THERAPY MAY POSSIBLY DECREASE CONTROL OVER FMS SYMPTOMS.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
13  963  37 EFFECTS OF A YOGA PROGRAM ON MENSTRUAL CRAMPS AND MENSTRUAL DISTRESS IN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WITH PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA: A SINGLE-BLIND, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA PROGRAM ON MENSTRUAL CRAMPS AND MENSTRUAL DISTRESS IN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WITH PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA. DESIGN: SINGLE-BLIND, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. PARTICIPANTS: 40 RANDOMLY SELECTED UNDERGRADUATE NURSING STUDENTS, WITH 20 EACH ASSIGNED TO AN EXERCISE OR A CONTROL GROUP. INTERVENTION: THE PARTICIPANTS ENGAGED IN A YOGA PROGRAM FOR 60 MINUTES ONCE A WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS. THE PROGRAM CONSISTED OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE COMBINED WITH RELAXATION AND MEDITATION. OUTCOME MEASURES: MENSTRUAL CRAMPS AND MENSTRUAL DISTRESS LEVELS WERE MEASURED BY USING THE VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE FOR PAIN AND THE MENSTRUAL DISTRESS QUESTIONNAIRE, RESPECTIVELY. DATA WERE ANALYZED BY USING THE KOLMOGOROV-SMIRNOV AND SHAPIRO-WILK NORMALITY TESTS, T-TEST, CHI-SQUARE TEST, LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS, AND MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (SPSS PROGRAM). RESULTS: MENSTRUAL PAIN INTENSITY (GROUP DIFFERENCE, -0.94; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI], -1.47 TO -0.42; P = 0.001) AND MENSTRUAL DISTRESS (GROUP DIFFERENCE, -1.13; 95% CI, -1.43 TO -0.82; P < 0.0001) SCORES DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT YOGA INTERVENTIONS MAY REDUCE MENSTRUAL CRAMPS AND MENSTRUAL DISTRESS IN FEMALE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WITH PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
14 2716  47 YOGA MANAGEMENT OF BREAST CANCER-RELATED LYMPHOEDEMA: A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED PILOT-TRIAL. BACKGROUND: SECONDARY ARM LYMPHOEDEMA CONTINUES TO AFFECT AT LEAST 20% OF WOMEN AFTER TREATMENT FOR BREAST CANCER REQUIRING LIFELONG PROFESSIONAL TREATMENT AND SELF-MANAGEMENT. THE HOLISTIC PRACTICE OF YOGA MAY OFFER BENEFITS AS AN ADJUNCT SELF-MANAGEMENT OPTION. THE AIM OF THIS SMALL PILOT TRIAL WAS TO GAIN PRELIMINARY DATA TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON WOMEN WITH STAGE ONE BREAST CANCER-RELATED LYMPHOEDEMA (BCRL). THIS PAPER REPORTS THE RESULTS FOR THE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMISED, AFTER BASELINE TESTING, TO RECEIVE EITHER AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION (N = 15), CONSISTING OF A WEEKLY 90-MINUTE TEACHER-LED CLASS AND A 40-MINUTE DAILY SESSION DELIVERED BY DVD, OR TO A USUAL CARE WAIT-LISTED CONTROL GROUP (N = 13). PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES WERE: ARM VOLUME OF LYMPHOEDEMA MEASURED BY CIRCUMFERENCE AND EXTRA-CELLULAR FLUID MEASURED BY BIOIMPEDANCE SPECTROSCOPY. SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES WERE: TISSUE INDURATION MEASURED BY TONOMETRY; LEVELS OF SENSATIONS, PAIN, FATIGUE, AND THEIR LIMITING EFFECTS ALL MEASURED BY A VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS) AND QUALITY OF LIFE BASED ON THE LYMPHOEDEMA QUALITY OF LIFE TOOL (LYMQOL). MEASUREMENTS WERE CONDUCTED AT BASELINE, WEEK 8 (POST-INTERVENTION) AND WEEK 12 (FOUR WEEKS AFTER CESSATION OF THE INTERVENTION). RESULTS: AT WEEK 8, THE INTERVENTION GROUP HAD A GREATER DECREASE IN TISSUE INDURATION OF THE AFFECTED UPPER ARM COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP (P = 0.050), AS WELL AS A GREATER REDUCTION IN THE SYMPTOM SUB-SCALE FOR QOL (P = 0.038). THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN ARM VOLUME OF LYMPHOEDEMA OR EXTRA-CELLULAR FLUID BETWEEN GROUPS AT WEEK 8; HOWEVER, AT WEEK 12, ARM VOLUME INCREASED MORE FOR THE INTERVENTION GROUP THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (P = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION REDUCED TISSUE INDURATION OF THE AFFECTED UPPER ARM AND DECREASED THE QOL SUB-SCALE OF SYMPTOMS. ARM VOLUME OF LYMPHOEDEMA AND EXTRA-CELLULAR FLUID DID NOT INCREASE. THESE BENEFITS DID NOT LAST ON CESSATION OF THE INTERVENTION WHEN ARM VOLUME OF LYMPHOEDEMA INCREASED. FURTHER RESEARCH TRIALS WITH A LONGER DURATION, HIGHER LEVELS OF LYMPHOEDEMA AND LARGER NUMBERS ARE WARRANTED BEFORE DEFINITIVE CONCLUSIONS CAN BE MADE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
15 2326  45 TREATMENT OF PREGNANCY-RELATED LUMBAR AND PELVIC GIRDLE PAIN BY THE YOGA METHOD: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. OBJECTIVE: PREGNANCY-RELATED LUMBOPELVIC PAIN IS A MAJOR PROBLEM FOR THE MAJORITY OF PREGNANT WOMEN. COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE HAS BEEN USED TO ALLEVIATE PAIN, AND YOGA IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE METHODS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HATHA YOGA IN THE REDUCTION OF LUMBOPELVIC PAIN IN PREGNANCY. METHODS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH 60 PREGNANT WOMEN (AGE RANGE, 14-40 YEARS) WHO REPORTED LUMBOPELVIC PAIN AT 12 TO 32 WEEKS OF GESTATION WAS CONDUCTED FROM JUNE 2009 TO JUNE 2011. PREGNANT WOMEN WHO HAD TWIN PREGNANCIES, HAD MEDICAL RESTRICTIONS FOR EXERCISE, USED ANALGESICS, AND PARTICIPATED IN PHYSICAL THERAPY WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE STUDY. PREGNANT WOMEN WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: THE YOGA GROUP, PRACTICING EXERCISES GUIDED BY THIS METHOD, AND THE POSTURAL ORIENTATION GROUP, PERFORMING STANDARDIZED POSTURE ORIENTATION ACCORDING TO INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED IN A PAMPHLET. TREATMENT IN EACH GROUP LASTED 10 WEEKS. A VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS) WAS USED TO MEASURE PAIN INTENSITY. LUMBAR PAIN AND POSTERIOR PELVIC PAIN PROVOCATION TESTS WERE USED TO CONFIRM THE PRESENCE OF PAIN. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS INCLUDED THE MANN-WHITNEY TEST, THE MCNEMAR TEST, A PAIRED WILCOXON TEST, AND ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE. RESULTS: THE MEDIAN PAIN SCORE WAS LOWER IN THE YOGA GROUP (P<.0058) THAN THE POSTURAL ORIENTATION GROUP. LUMBAR PAIN PROVOCATION TESTS SHOWED A DECREASED RESPONSE IN RELATION TO POSTERIOR PELVIC PAIN PROVOCATION TESTS AND A GRADUAL REDUCTION IN PAIN INTENSITY DURING 10 YOGA SESSIONS (P<.024). CONCLUSIONS: THE YOGA METHOD WAS MORE EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING LUMBOPELVIC PAIN INTENSITY COMPARED WITH POSTURAL ORIENTATION.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
16 1180  42 EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICACY OF IYENGAR YOGA THERAPY ON CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. STUDY DESIGN: THE EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICACY OF IYENGAR YOGA FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) WERE ASSESSED WITH INTENTION-TO-TREAT AND PER-PROTOCOL ANALYSIS. NINETY SUBJECTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO A YOGA (N = 43) OR CONTROL GROUP (N = 47) RECEIVING STANDARD MEDICAL CARE. PARTICIPANTS WERE FOLLOWED 6 MONTHS AFTER COMPLETION OF THE INTERVENTION. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE IYENGAR YOGA THERAPY ON CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. YOGA SUBJECTS WERE HYPOTHESIZED TO REPORT GREATER REDUCTIONS IN FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY, PAIN INTENSITY, DEPRESSION, AND PAIN MEDICATION USAGE THAN CONTROLS. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: CLBP IS A MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDER WITH PUBLIC HEALTH AND ECONOMIC IMPACT. PILOT STUDIES OF YOGA AND BACK PAIN HAVE REPORTED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN CLINICALLY IMPORTANT OUTCOMES. METHODS: SUBJECTS WERE RECRUITED THROUGH SELF-REFERRAL AND HEALTH PROFESSIONAL REFERRALS ACCORDING TO EXPLICIT INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA. YOGA SUBJECTS PARTICIPATED IN 24 WEEKS OF BIWEEKLY YOGA CLASSES DESIGNED FOR CLBP. OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED AT 12 (MIDWAY), 24 (IMMEDIATELY AFTER), AND 48 WEEKS (6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP) AFTER THE START OF THE INTERVENTION USING THE OSWESTRY DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE, A VISUAL ANALOG SCALE, THE BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY, AND A PAIN MEDICATION-USAGE QUESTIONNAIRE. RESULTS: USING INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS WITH REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA (GROUP X TIME), SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER REDUCTIONS IN FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY AND PAIN INTENSITY WERE OBSERVED IN THE YOGA GROUP WHEN COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP AT 24 WEEKS. A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER PROPORTION OF YOGA SUBJECTS ALSO REPORTED CLINICAL IMPROVEMENTS AT BOTH 12 AND 24 WEEKS. IN ADDITION, DEPRESSION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN YOGA SUBJECTS. FURTHERMORE, WHILE A REDUCTION IN PAIN MEDICATION OCCURRED, THIS WAS COMPARABLE IN BOTH GROUPS. WHEN RESULTS WERE ANALYZED USING PER-PROTOCOL ANALYSIS, IMPROVEMENTS WERE OBSERVED FOR ALL OUTCOMES IN THE YOGA GROUP, INCLUDING AGREATER TREND FOR REDUCED PAIN MEDICATION USAGE. ALTHOUGH SLIGHTLY LESS THAN AT 24 WEEKS, THE YOGA GROUP HAD STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY, PAIN INTENSITY, AND DEPRESSION COMPARED TO STANDARD MEDICAL CARE 6-MONTHS POSTINTERVENTION. CONCLUSION: YOGA IMPROVES FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY, PAIN INTENSITY, AND DEPRESSION IN ADULTS WITH CLBP. THERE WAS ALSO A CLINICALLY IMPORTANT TREND FOR THE YOGA GROUP TO REDUCE THEIR PAIN MEDICATION USAGE COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP.	2009	
          
17  521  35 COMPARING YOGA, EXERCISE, AND A SELF-CARE BOOK FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN IS A COMMON PROBLEM THAT HAS ONLY MODESTLY EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOGA IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN CONVENTIONAL THERAPEUTIC EXERCISE OR A SELF-CARE BOOK FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. DESIGN: RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: A NONPROFIT, INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. PATIENTS: 101 ADULTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. INTERVENTION: 12-WEEK SESSIONS OF YOGA OR CONVENTIONAL THERAPEUTIC EXERCISE CLASSES OR A SELF-CARE BOOK. MEASUREMENTS: PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE BACK-RELATED FUNCTIONAL STATUS (MODIFIED 24-POINT ROLAND DISABILITY SCALE) AND "BOTHERSOMENESS" OF PAIN (11-POINT NUMERICAL SCALE). THE PRIMARY TIME POINT WAS 12 WEEKS. CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE WAS CONSIDERED TO BE 2.5 POINTS ON THE FUNCTIONAL STATUS SCALE AND 1.5 POINTS ON THE BOTHERSOMENESS SCALE. SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE DAYS OF RESTRICTED ACTIVITY, GENERAL HEALTH STATUS, AND MEDICATION USE. RESULTS: AFTER ADJUSTMENT FOR BASELINE VALUES, BACK-RELATED FUNCTION IN THE YOGA GROUP WAS SUPERIOR TO THE BOOK AND EXERCISE GROUPS AT 12 WEEKS (YOGA VS. BOOK: MEAN DIFFERENCE, -3.4 [95% CI, -5.1 TO - 1.6] [P < 0.001]; YOGA VS. EXERCISE: MEAN DIFFERENCE, -1.8 [CI, -3.5 TO - 0.1] [P = 0.034]). NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN SYMPTOM BOTHERSOMENESS WERE FOUND BETWEEN ANY 2 GROUPS AT 12 WEEKS; AT 26 WEEKS, THE YOGA GROUP WAS SUPERIOR TO THE BOOK GROUP WITH RESPECT TO THIS MEASURE (MEAN DIFFERENCE, -2.2 [CI, -3.2 TO - 1.2]; P < 0.001). AT 26 WEEKS, BACK-RELATED FUNCTION IN THE YOGA GROUP WAS SUPERIOR TO THE BOOK GROUP (MEAN DIFFERENCE, -3.6 [CI, -5.4 TO - 1.8]; P < 0.001). LIMITATIONS: PARTICIPANTS IN THIS STUDY WERE FOLLOWED FOR ONLY 26 WEEKS AFTER RANDOMIZATION. ONLY 1 INSTRUCTOR DELIVERED EACH INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA WAS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN A SELF-CARE BOOK FOR IMPROVING FUNCTION AND REDUCING CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN, AND THE BENEFITS PERSISTED FOR AT LEAST SEVERAL MONTHS.	2005	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
18 2524  41 YOGA DURING PREGNANCY: EFFECTS ON MATERNAL COMFORT, LABOR PAIN AND BIRTH OUTCOMES. THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA PROGRAM DURING PREGNANCY, ON MATERNAL COMFORT, LABOR PAIN, AND BIRTH OUTCOMES. A RANDOMIZED TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED USING 74-PRIMIGRAVID THAI WOMEN WHO WERE EQUALLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS (EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL). THE YOGA PROGRAM INVOLVED SIX, 1-H SESSIONS AT PRESCRIBED WEEKS OF GESTATION. A VARIETY OF INSTRUMENTS WERE USED TO ASSESS MATERNAL COMFORT, LABOR PAIN AND BIRTH OUTCOMES. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS FOUND TO HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF MATERNAL COMFORT DURING LABOR AND 2H POST-LABOR, AND EXPERIENCED LESS SUBJECT EVALUATED LABOR PAIN THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. IN EACH GROUP, PAIN INCREASED AND MATERNAL COMFORT DECREASED AS LABOR PROGRESSED. NO DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND, BETWEEN THE GROUPS, REGARDING PETHIDINE USAGE, LABOR AUGMENTATION OR NEWBORN APGAR SCORES AT 1 AND 5 MIN. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS FOUND TO HAVE A SHORTER DURATION OF THE FIRST STAGE OF LABOR, AS WELL AS THE TOTAL TIME OF LABOR.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
19 1585  38 MEDICAL YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH STRESS-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSES IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PATIENTS ARE SUFFERING FROM STRESS-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE MEDICAL YOGA TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH STRESS-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSES IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE. A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY WAS PERFORMED AT A PRIMARY HEALTH CARE CENTRE IN SWEDEN FROM MARCH TO JUNE, 2011. PATIENTS WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO A CONTROL GROUP RECEIVING STANDARD CARE OR A YOGA GROUP TREATED WITH MEDICAL YOGA FOR 1 HOUR, ONCE A WEEK, OVER A 12-WEEK PERIOD IN ADDITION TO THE STANDARD CARE. A TOTAL OF 37 MEN AND WOMEN, MEAN AGE OF 53 +/- 12 YEARS WERE INCLUDED. GENERAL STRESS LEVEL (MEASURED USING PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE (PSS)), BURNOUT (SHIROM-MELAMED BURNOUT QUESTIONNAIRE (SMBQ)), ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION (HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE (HADS)), INSOMNIA SEVERITY (INSOMNIA SEVERITY INDEX (ISI)), PAIN (VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS)), AND OVERALL HEALTH STATUS (EURO QUALITY OF LIFE VAS (EQ-VAS)) WERE MEASURED BEFORE AND AFTER 12 WEEKS. PATIENTS ASSIGNED TO THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENTS ON MEASURES OF GENERAL STRESS LEVEL (P < 0.000), ANXIETY (P < 0.019), AND OVERALL HEALTH STATUS (P < 0.018) COMPARED TO CONTROLS. TREATMENT WITH MEDICAL YOGA IS EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING LEVELS OF STRESS AND ANXIETY IN PATIENTS WITH STRESS-RELATED SYMPTOMS IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
20 1022  57 EFFECTS OF YOGA AND MEDITATION ON THE BIRTH PROCESS. CONTEXT: DURING LABOR, CONSCIOUS MATERNAL EXPULSIVE EFFORTS ARE CRUCIAL, ESPECIALLY IN THE SECOND STAGE. CONTEMPORARILY, MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL'S BEDSIDE OBSERVATIONS INDICATE AN INADEQUACY IN THE MATERNAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE PROCESS OF DELIVERY THAT HAS LED TO INCREASED RATES OF CAESAREAN SECTIONS AND INTERVENTIONAL DELIVERIES. FOR THAT REASON, THE IMPORTANCE OF YOGA, MEDITATION, AND BREATH-AWARENESS PRACTICES INCREASES DURING PREGNANCY AND BIRTH. OBJECTIVE: THE STUDY INTENDED TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT ON THE DELIVERY PROCESS OF THE PRACTICE OF YOGA AND MEDITATION DURING PREGNANCY AND LABOR. DESIGN: THE RESEARCH TEAM DESIGNED A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: THE RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED BETWEEN OCTOBER 2016 AND MAY 2018 AT AN EDUCATIONAL AND RESEARCH HOSPITAL IN ISTANBUL, TURKEY, ON THE ANATOLIAN SIDE OF THE ISTANBUL PROVINCE. PARTICIPANTS: PARTICIPANTS WERE 90 PRIMIPAROUS PREGNANT WOMEN WHO APPLIED TO THE PREGNANCY SCHOOL AT THE HOSPITAL AND WHO MET THE CRITERIA FOR ACCEPTANCE INTO THE STUDY. INTERVENTION: THE PARTICIPANTS WAS RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS, 30 IN AN INTERVENTION GROUP AND 60 IN A CONTROL GROUP. THE INTERVENTION GROUP PERFORMED YOGA AND MEDITATION FOR 60 MINUTES TWO TIMES A WEEK FOR 10 WEEKS. YOGA AND MEDITATION PRACTICES ALSO OCCURRED DURING THE COURSE OF LABOR FOR THE INTERVENTION GROUP. ROUTINE MIDWIFERY CARE WAS GIVEN TO BOTH GROUPS DURING LABOR. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE DATA WERE COLLECTED USING: (1) THE STATE TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY (STAI), (2) THE WIJMA DELIVERY EXPECTANCY/EXPERIENCE QUESTIONNAIRE A, (3) THE CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY SCALE (CBSEI) SHORT FORM, (4) THE WIJMA DELIVERY EXPECTANCY/EXPERIENCE QUESTIONNAIRE VERSION B, AND (5) A VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS) FOR PAIN. RESULTS: WHEN THE LABOR DATA WERE EVALUATED, THE INTERVENTION GROUP HAD STATISTICALLY HIGHER VAGINAL DELIVERY RATES, LOWER LABOR INTERVENTION RATES AND EPISIOTOMY OPENING FREQUENCIES, LOWER PAIN MEASUREMENT SCORES AND WIJMA B SCORES, AND HIGHER CBSEI SCORES THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. HOWEVER, THE INTERVENTION GROUP'S STAI SCORES HAD INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER THE PRACTICE POST INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA AND MEDITATION ARE EFFECTIVE METHODS FOR REDUCING PAIN AND FEAR PERCEPTION AND INCREASING SELF-EFFICACY AND VAGINAL DELIVERY RATES DURING THE LABOR PROCESS.	2022

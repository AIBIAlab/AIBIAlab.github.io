1  304 120 AN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF YOGA-RELATED INJURY PRESENTATIONS TO EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS IN AUSTRALIA. OBJECTIVES: DESPITE BEING CONSIDERED A LOW-INTENSITY EXERCISE, CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT THE RISK OF INJURIES ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA. THIS STUDY AIMED TO ANALYZE THE CHARACTERISTICS AND TREND OF YOGA-RELATED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) PRESENTATIONS FROM JULY 2009 TO JUNE 2016 IN VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA. METHODS: THE VICTORIAN EMERGENCY MINIMUM DATASET (VEMD) WAS USED TO COLLECT THE DE-IDENTIFIED DATA. THE DATA WERE FIRST ANALYZED USING DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS AND SPEARMAN'S CORRELATION. FURTHER INJURY TREND WAS ANALYZED BY CALCULATING THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE OF THE NUMBER OF YOGA-RELATED INJURIES DURING THE 7-YEAR STUDY PERIOD. RESULTS: THERE WERE 118 YOGA-RELATED INJURY CASES THAT SIGNIFICANTLY (P < .05) INCREASED BY 357% FROM JULY 2009 TO JUNE 2016. MOST OF THE CASES WERE FEMALE (N = 96; 81.4%) AND BETWEEN 20 AND 39 YEARS OLD (N = 68, 57.6%). MOST COMMON INJURIES COMPRISED DISLOCATIONS/SPRAINS/STRAINS (N = 60, 51.7%) FOLLOWED BY FRACTURES (N = 17, 14.4%), AND INJURY TO MUSCLE/TENDON (N = 15, 12.7%). CONCLUSION: THE FINDINGS WARRANT FUTURE NATIONWIDE RESEARCH AS WELL AS AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES OF YOGA SERVICE PROVIDERS TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF INJURY.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
2 2001  24 STRESS, INFLAMMATION, AND YOGA PRACTICE. OBJECTIVE: TO ADDRESS THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING HATHA YOGA'S POTENTIAL STRESS-REDUCTION BENEFITS, WE COMPARED INFLAMMATORY AND ENDOCRINE RESPONSES OF NOVICE AND EXPERT YOGA PRACTITIONERS BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER A RESTORATIVE HATHA YOGA SESSION, AS WELL AS IN TWO CONTROL CONDITIONS. STRESSORS BEFORE EACH OF THE THREE CONDITIONS PROVIDED DATA ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH YOGA SPEEDED AN INDIVIDUAL'S PHYSIOLOGICAL RECOVERY. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 50 HEALTHY WOMEN (MEAN AGE, 41.32 YEARS; RANGE, 30-65 YEARS), 25 NOVICES AND 25 EXPERTS, WERE EXPOSED TO EACH OF THE CONDITIONS (YOGA, MOVEMENT CONTROL, AND PASSIVE-VIDEO CONTROL) DURING THREE SEPARATE VISITS. RESULTS: THE YOGA SESSION BOOSTED PARTICIPANTS' POSITIVE AFFECT COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL CONDITIONS, BUT NO OVERALL DIFFERENCES IN INFLAMMATORY OR ENDOCRINE RESPONSES WERE UNIQUE TO THE YOGA SESSION. IMPORTANTLY, EVEN THOUGH NOVICES AND EXPERTS DID NOT DIFFER ON KEY DIMENSIONS, INCLUDING AGE, ABDOMINAL ADIPOSITY, AND CARDIORESPIRATORY FITNESS, NOVICES' SERUM INTERLEUKIN (IL)-6 LEVELS WERE 41% HIGHER THAN THOSE OF EXPERTS ACROSS SESSIONS, AND THE ODDS OF A NOVICE HAVING DETECTABLE C-REACTIVE PROTEIN (CRP) WERE 4.75 TIMES AS HIGH AS THAT OF AN EXPERT. DIFFERENCES IN STRESS RESPONSES BETWEEN EXPERTS AND NOVICES PROVIDED ONE PLAUSIBLE MECHANISM FOR THEIR DIVERGENT SERUM IL-6 DATA; EXPERTS PRODUCED LESS LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE-STIMULATED IL-6 IN RESPONSE TO THE STRESSOR THAN NOVICES, AND IL-6 PROMOTES CRP PRODUCTION. CONCLUSION: THE ABILITY TO MINIMIZE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES TO STRESSFUL ENCOUNTERS INFLUENCES THE BURDEN THAT STRESSORS PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL. IF YOGA DAMPENS OR LIMITS STRESS-RELATED CHANGES, THEN REGULAR PRACTICE COULD HAVE SUBSTANTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
3 1490  33 INTEREST IN YOGA AMONG FIBROMYALGIA PATIENTS: AN INTERNATIONAL INTERNET SURVEY. STUDIES IN CIRCUMSCRIBED CLINICAL SETTINGS HAVE REPORTED THE ADOPTION OF YOGA BY MANY FIBROMYALGIA (FM) PATIENTS. HOWEVER, IT IS UNCLEAR FROM EXISTING STUDIES WHICH TYPES OF YOGA PRACTICES FM PATIENTS ARE TYPICALLY ENGAGING IN AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY EXPERIENCE YOGA AS HELPFUL OR NOT. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO SURVEY FM PATIENTS IN MANY DIFFERENT REGIONS TO INQUIRE ABOUT THEIR ENGAGEMENT IN VARIOUS YOGA PRACTICES, THE PERCEIVED BENEFITS, AND THE OBSTACLES TO FURTHER PRACTICE. A 13-QUESTION INTERNET SURVEY OF PERSONS SELF-IDENTIFIED AS FM PATIENTS WAS CONDUCTED AMONG SUBSCRIBERS TO 2 ELECTRONIC NEWSLETTERS ON THE TOPIC OF FM. RESPONDENTS (N = 2543) REPLIED FROM ALL 50 U.S. STATES AND ALSO FROM CANADA, AUSTRALIA, AND THE UNITED KINGDOM, AND FROM MORE THAN TWO DOZEN OTHER COUNTRIES. ON AVERAGE, RESPONDENTS WERE 57 YEARS OF AGE AND 96% WERE FEMALE, WITH AN AVERAGE TIME SINCE DIAGNOSIS OF 13 YEARS. OF THESE RESPONDENTS, 79.8% HAD CONSIDERED TRYING YOGA AND 57.8% HAD ATTENDED 1 YOGA CLASS. THE RESPONDENTS' CLASSES TYPICALLY FOCUSED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON YOGA POSES, WITH MINIMAL TRAINING IN MEDITATION, BREATHING TECHNIQUES, OR OTHER PRACTICES. THE MOST COMMONLY CITED BENEFITS WERE REDUCED STIFFNESS, RELAXATION, AND BETTER BALANCE. THE MOST FREQUENTLY CITED OBSTACLES WERE CONCERNS ABOUT THE POSES BEING TOO PHYSICALLY DEMANDING AND FEAR THAT THE POSES WOULD CAUSE TOO MUCH PAIN. THESE FINDINGS CONFIRM STRONG INTEREST IN YOGA ACROSS A GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSE RANGE OF FM PATIENTS. HOWEVER, CONCERNS ABOUT YOGA-INDUCED PAIN AND YOGA POSES BEING TOO DIFFICULT ARE COMMON REASONS THAT FM PATIENTS DO NOT ENGAGE IN YOGA EXERCISES. THIS STUDY SUPPORTS THE NEED FOR YOGA PROGRAMS TAILORED FOR FM PATIENTS TO INCLUDE MODIFICATION OF POSES TO MINIMIZE AGGRAVATING MOVEMENTS AND SUBSTANTIVE TRAINING IN MEDITATION AND OTHER YOGA-BASED COPING METHODS TO MINIMIZE PAIN-RELATED FEAR.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
4  253  28 A YOGA STRENGTHENING PROGRAM DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE THE KNEE ADDUCTION MOMENT FOR WOMEN WITH KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS: A PROOF-OF-PRINCIPLE COHORT STUDY. UNLABELLED: PEOPLE WITH KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS MAY BENEFIT FROM EXERCISE PRESCRIPTIONS THAT MINIMIZE KNEE LOADS IN THE FRONTAL PLANE. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER A NOVEL 12-WEEK STRENGTHENING PROGRAM DESIGNED TO MINIMIZE EXPOSURE TO THE KNEE ADDUCTION MOMENT (KAM) COULD IMPROVE SYMPTOMS AND KNEE STRENGTH IN WOMEN WITH SYMPTOMATIC KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS. A SECONDARY OBJECTIVE WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PROGRAM COULD IMPROVE MOBILITY AND FITNESS, AND DECREASE PEAK KAM DURING GAIT. THE TERTIARY OBJECTIVE WAS TO EVALUATE THE BIOMECHANICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS YOGA PROGRAM. IN PARTICULAR, WE COMPARED THE PEAK KAM DURING GAIT WITH THAT DURING YOGA POSTURES AT BASELINE. WE ALSO COMPARED LOWER LIMB NORMALIZED MEAN ELECTROMYOGRAPHY (EMG) AMPLITUDES DURING YOGA POSTURES BETWEEN BASELINE AND FOLLOW-UP. PRIMARY MEASURES INCLUDED SELF-REPORTED PAIN AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION (KNEE INJURY AND OSTEOARTHRITIS OUTCOME SCORE) AND KNEE STRENGTH (EXTENSOR AND FLEXOR TORQUES). SECONDARY MEASURES INCLUDED MOBILITY (SIX-MINUTE WALK, 30-SECOND CHAIR STAND, STAIR CLIMBING), FITNESS (SUBMAXIMAL CYCLE ERGOMETER TEST), AND CLINICAL GAIT ANALYSIS USING MOTION CAPTURE SYNCHRONIZED WITH ELECTROMYOGRAPHY AND FORCE MEASUREMENT. ALSO, KAM AND NORMALIZED MEAN EMG AMPLITUDES WERE COLLECTED DURING YOGA POSTURES. FORTY-FIVE WOMEN OVER AGE 50 WITH SYMPTOMATIC KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS, CONSISTENT WITH THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RHEUMATOLOGY CRITERIA, ENROLLED IN OUR 12-WEEK (3 SESSIONS PER WEEK) PROGRAM. DATA FROM 38 WERE ANALYZED (SIX DROP-OUTS; ONE LOST TO CO-INTERVENTION). PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCED REDUCED PAIN (MEAN IMPROVEMENT 10.1-20.1 NORMALIZED TO 100; P<0.001), INCREASED KNEE EXTENSOR STRENGTH (MEAN IMPROVEMENT 0.01 NM/KG; P = 0.004), AND INCREASED FLEXOR STRENGTH (MEAN IMPROVEMENT 0.01 NM/KG; P = 0.001) AT FOLLOW-UP COMPARED TO BASELINE. PARTICIPANTS IMPROVED MOBILITY ON THE SIX-MINUTE WALK (MEAN IMPROVEMENT 37.7 M; P<0.001) AND 30-SECOND CHAIR STAND (MEAN IMPROVEMENT 1.3; P = 0.006) AT FOLLOW-UP COMPARED TO BASELINE. FITNESS AND PEAK KAM DURING GAIT WERE UNCHANGED BETWEEN BASELINE AND FOLLOW-UP. AVERAGE KAM DURING THE YOGA POSTURES WERE LOWER THAN THAT OF NORMAL GAIT. NORMALIZED MEAN EMG AMPLITUDES DURING YOGA POSTURES WERE UP TO 31.0% OF MAXIMUM BUT DID NOT CHANGE BETWEEN BASELINE AND FOLLOW-UP. IN THIS COHORT STUDY, THE YOGA-BASED STRENGTHENING POSTURES THAT ELICIT LOW KAMS IMPROVED KNEE SYMPTOMS AND STRENGTH IN WOMEN WITH KNEE OA FOLLOWING A 12 WEEK PROGRAM (3 SESSIONS PER WEEK). THE PROGRAM ALSO IMPROVED MOBILITY, BUT DID NOT IMPROVE FITNESS OR REDUCE PEAK KAM DURING GAIT. THE KAM DURING THE YOGA POSTURES WERE LOWER THAN THAT OF NORMAL GAIT. OVERALL, THE PROPOSED PROGRAM MAY BE USEFUL IN IMPROVING PAIN, STRENGTH, AND MOBILITY IN WOMEN WITH KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS. CLINICAL EFFICACY NEEDS TO BE ASSESSED USING A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL DESIGN. TRIAL REGISTRATION: CLINICALTRIALS.GOV NCT02146105.	2015	

5 2734  28 YOGA PARTICIPATION ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN DIETARY PATTERNS AND STRESS: A PILOT STUDY IN STRESSED ADULTS WITH POOR DIET. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: STRESS CONTRIBUTES TO DIETARY PATTERNS THAT IMPEDE HEALTH. YOGA IS AN INTEGRATIVE STRESS MANAGEMENT APPROACH ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED DIETARY PATTERNS IN BURGEONING RESEARCH. YET, NO RESEARCH HAS EXAMINED CHANGE IN DIETARY PATTERNS, BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), AND STRESS DURING A YOGA INTERVENTION AMONG STRESSED ADULTS WITH POOR DIET. MATERIALS AND METHODS: OBJECTIVELY-MEASURED BMI AND A BATTERY OF SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES WERE COLLECTED AT FOUR TIME POINTS DURING AND FOLLOWING A 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION (N = 78, 71% WOMEN, MEAN BMI = 25.69 KG/M(2)+/-4.59) - PRE-TREATMENT (T1), MID-TREATMENT (6 WEEKS; T2), POST-TREATMENT (12 WEEKS; T3), AND AT 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP (24 WEEKS; T4). RESULTS: T1 TO T3 FRUIT AND VEGETABLE INTAKE, BMI, AND STRESS SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINED IN THE OVERALL SAMPLE. REDUCTION IN VEGETABLE INTAKE WAS NO LONGER SIGNIFICANT AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR REDUCTIONS IN CALORIC INTAKE, AND REDUCTION IN CALORIC INTAKE REMAINED SIGNIFICANT AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR REDUCTIONS IN STRESS. CONCLUSION: FINDINGS MAY BE INTERPRETED AS YOGA EITHER ENCOURAGING OR ADVERSELY IMPACTING HEALTHY DIETARY PATTERNS (I.E., MINIMIZING LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE WEIGHT GAIN VS. DECREASING VEGETABLE INTAKE AND OVERALL CALORIC INTAKE AMONG INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY NOT NEED TO LOSE WEIGHT, RESPECTIVELY).

6 1927  23 ROLE OF YOGA IN CARDIAC DISEASE AND REHABILITATION. PURPOSE: CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE CONTINUES TO BE THE LEADING CAUSE OF MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY AROUND THE WORLD. YOGA, A COMBINATION OF PHYSICAL POSTURES (ASANA), BREATHING EXERCISES (PRANAYAMA), AND MEDITATION (DHYANA), HAS GAINED INCREASING RECOGNITION AS A FORM OF MIND-BODY EXERCISE. IN THIS NARRATIVE REVIEW, WE INTENDED TO REVIEW THE EMERGING EVIDENCE ASSESSING THE PHYSIOLOGIC AND CLINICAL EFFECTS OF YOGA ON THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM AND THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF YOGA AS A COMPONENT OF COMPREHENSIVE CARDIAC REHABILITATION. METHODS: WE SEARCHED PUBMED, GOOGLE SCHOLAR, EMBASE, AND COCHRANE DATABASES FOR LITERATURE RELATED TO CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS OF YOGA FROM INCEPTION UP UNTIL 2017. RESULTS: YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE FAVORABLE EFFECTS ON SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION, STRESS, THE CARDIAC AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM, AND TRADITIONAL AND EMERGING CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA HAS SHOWN PROMISE AS A USEFUL LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION THAT CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE MANAGEMENT ALGORITHMS. ALTHOUGH MANY INVESTIGATORS HAVE REPORTED THE CLINICAL BENEFITS OF YOGA IN REDUCING CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS, MORBIDITY, AND MORTALITY, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THESE CONCLUSIONS IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED, THEREBY EMPHASIZING THE NEED FOR LARGE, WELL-DESIGNED RANDOMIZED TRIALS THAT MINIMIZE BIAS AND METHODOLOGICAL DRAWBACKS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
7 1391  35 IMPACT OF YOGA AND EXERCISES ON POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME RISK AMONG ADOLESCENT SCHOOLGIRLS IN SOUTH INDIA. BACKGROUND: TO IDENTIFY THE ADOLESCENT SCHOOL GIRLS WITH RISK FOR POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME (PCOS), ASSESS THEIR RISK STATUS, AND EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS ON PCOS RISK REDUCTION. METHODS: AN EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED AMONG ADOLESCENT GIRLS BELONGING TO TWO GOVERNMENT RUN SCHOOLS IN TIRUVALLUR DISTRICT OF TAMIL NADU STATE, INDIA, FROM 6 JUNE TO 9 DECEMBER 2016. A STANDARD RISK ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRE WAS ADOPTED FOR RISK ASSESSMENT AFTER MAKING FEW MODIFICATIONS (CRONBACH ALPHA 0.86). THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP RECEIVED LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS (YOGA FOR TWO MONTHS AND WALKING EXERCISE FOR TWO MONTHS), WITH NO SUCH INTERVENTION PROVIDED FOR THE CONTROL GROUP. THE IMPACT OF THESE INTERVENTIONS WAS ASSESSED IN TERMS OF RISK MINIMIZATION AND A P VALUE LESS THAN .05 WAS CONSIDERED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 204 (CONTROL-102; EXPERIMENTAL-102) GIRLS WITH STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN DEMOGRAPHIC FEATURES WERE STUDIED. DURING THE PRETEST, 85.2% (N = 87) IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND 83.3% (N = 85) THE CONTROLS HAD "MODERATE RISK" FOR PCOS. GIRLS WITH "HIGH RISK" LEVEL OF PCOS WERE 14.8% (N = 15) AND 15.7% (N = 17) IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND THE CONTROL GROUP, RESPECTIVELY. IN POSTTEST-1 (AFTER YOGA SESSIONS) RISK ASSESSMENT, 71.6% HAD "MODERATE RISK," 5.9% HAD "HIGH RISK" IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP, WHEREAS 87.3% HAD "MODERATE RISK" AND 12.7% HAD "HIGH RISK" IN THE CONTROL GROUP. IN POSTTEST-2 (AFTER EXERCISE SESSIONS) RISK ASSESSMENT, 48% HAD "MODERATE RISK" AND 0% HAD HIGH RISK IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP, WHEREAS 88.2% WERE "MODERATE RISK" AND 11.8% WERE "HIGH RISK" IN THE CONTROL GROUP. REPEATED MEASURE ANOVA WITH GREENHOUSE-GEISSER CORRECTION SHOWED MEAN RISK REDUCTION SCORE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN PRETEST AND POST-TEST (33.38 +/- 7.28 VS 22.75 +/- 12.09, RESPECTIVELY MEAN DIFFERENCE IS 10.63: F = 236.12 P < .001), SUGGESTING A POSITIVE CORRELATION WITH THE INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA AND EXERCISE WERE BENEFICIAL IN MINIMIZING PCOS RISK, AS REFLECTED IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT SCORE. MORE SUCH INTERVENTIONS, COVERING DIFFERENT SCHOOLS, COULD PROVIDE LARGER HEALTH BENEFITS.	2020

9 2438  21 YOGA AND QIGONG IN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PREVENTION OF MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS: A CONCEPTUAL SYNTHESIS. THE STUDY PROPOSES TO EXPLORE TWO ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE THERAPIES-QIGONG AND YOGA FOR BALANCING THE ESSENTIAL DUO OF HOLISTIC MIND-BODY AND CONSEQUENTLY OFFER A SOLUTION FOR STRESS, UNCERTAINTY, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. QUALITATIVE RESEARCH METHODS HAVE BEEN USED TO CREATE A CONCEPTUAL SYNTHESIS OF YOGA AND QIGONG. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT AN INCREASED SENSE OF CONTROL IS THE INTERFACE BETWEEN THESE TWO MODALITIES. THIS CONCEPTUAL CONGRUENCE OF QIGONG AND YOGA IS THOUGHT TO BE A SELECTIVE, CURATIVE METHOD, A PRESCRIPTION FOR IDEAL LIVING AND A GROUND OF HUMAN ESSENCE EXISTENCE. FURTHERMORE, THIS ESSENCE IS THOUGHT TO ENHANCE THE MIND'S SELF-REGULATORY PROCESSES AND PREVENT MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS. THE TWO ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES CAN PREVENT MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS SUCH AS ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND, MINIMIZE MENTAL HEALTH DISRUPTIONS SUCH AS STRESS AND POOR QUALITY OF LIFE. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT PATIENTS AND/OR CLIENTS CAN BENEFIT FROM THIS FUSION.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
10   92  19 A NARRATIVE REVIEW OF MOVEMENT-BASED MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS: EFFECTS OF YOGA, TAI CHI, AND QIGONG FOR BACK PAIN PATIENTS. THIS NARRATIVE LITERATURE REVIEW EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF MOVEMENT-BASED MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS (MMBIS; YOGA, TAI CHI, AND QIGONG) ON LOW BACK PAIN. A SEARCH OF DATABASES WAS CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY RELEVANT STUDIES. THIRTY-TWO ARTICLES MET INCLUSION CRITERIA AND WERE INCLUDED FOR THIS NARRATIVE REVIEW. OF THE REVIEWED STUDIES, THE HIGHEST NUMBER FOCUSED ON YOGA INTERVENTION (N = 25), 4 FOCUSED ON QIGONG, AND 3 FOCUSED ON TAI CHI IN MANAGING BACK PAIN. THE SELECTED ARTICLES SHOWED MMBI TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR TREATMENT OF LOW BACK PAIN, REPORTING POSITIVE OUTCOMES SUCH AS REDUCTION IN PAIN OR PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS (EG, DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY), AND IMPROVED FUNCTIONAL ABILITY. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF MMBI, IN PARTICULAR QIGONG AND TAI CHI. MORE CLINICAL TRIALS ARE NEEDED TO DETERMINE HOW TO REDUCE BACK PAIN, IMPROVE PHYSICAL FUNCTION, AND MINIMIZE BEHAVIORAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH LOW BACK PAIN. NURSE PRACTITIONERS MAY INTRODUCE SUCH MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS FOR MANAGING PAIN, ESPECIALLY FOR PATIENTS AT HIGH RISK FOR ADVERSE EFFECTS FROM PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT, AND REFER THEM TO A YOGA THERAPIST, TAI-CHI INSTRUCTOR, OR QIGONG INSTRUCTOR.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
11 2306  28 TRAINING BENEFITS AND INJURY RISKS OF STANDING YOGA APPLIED IN MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS: LOWER LIMB BIOMECHANICAL ANALYSIS. STANDING YOGA POSES STRENGTHEN A PERSON'S LEGS AND HELPS TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF MUSCULOSKELETAL REHABILITATION, BUT INADEQUATE EXERCISE PLANNING CAN CAUSE INJURIES. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED CHANGES IN THE ELECTROMYOGRAM AND JOINT MOMENTS OF FORCE (JMOFS) OF LOWER EXTREMITIES DURING COMMON STANDING YOGA POSES IN ORDER TO EXPLORE THE FEASIBILITY AND POSSIBLE INJURY RISK IN DEALING WITH MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS. ELEVEN YOGA INSTRUCTORS WERE RECRUITED TO EXECUTE FIVE YOGA POSES (CHAIR, TREE, WARRIOR 1, 2, AND 3). THE RESULTS REVEALED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN HIP, KNEE, AND ANKLE JMOFS AND VARYING DEGREES OF MUSCLE ACTIVATION AMONG THE POSES. AMONG THESE POSES, RECTUS FEMORIS MUSCLE ACTIVATION DURING THE CHAIR POSE WAS THE HIGHEST, WARRIOR 2 PRODUCED THE HIGHEST MUSCLE ACTIVATION IN THE VASTUS LATERALIS OF THE FRONT LIMB, WHILE WARRIOR 1 HAD THE HIGHEST MUSCLE ACTIVATION IN THE VASTUS MEDIALIS OF THE BACK LIMB. THEREFORE, ALL THREE POSES CAN POSSIBLY BE SUGGESTED AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION FOR QUADRICEPS STRENGTHENING. WARRIOR 1 WAS POSSIBLY SUGGESTED AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION IN ORDER TO REDUCE EXCESSIVE LATERAL OVERLOAD OF THE PATELLA, BUT THE POSSIBLE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF WARRIOR 2 WITH THE HIGHEST KNEE ADDUCTOR JMOF IN THE BACK LIMB COULD RAISE JOINT REACTION FORCES ACROSS THE MEDIAL CONDYLES. IN SINGLE-LEG BALANCE POSTURES, WARRIOR 3 HAD UNIQUE TRAINING EFFECTS ON THE HAMSTRING, AND IS THEREFORE SUGGESTED AS A PART OF HAMSTRING REHABILITATION EXERCISES. THE TREE POSE INDUCED LOW LOWER-EXTREMITY JMOFS AND A LOW LEVEL OF THIGH MUSCLE ACTIVATIONS WHEN IT WAS PERFORMED BY SENIOR INSTRUCTORS WITH EXCELLENT BALANCE CONTROL; HOWEVER, FOR YOGA BEGINNERS WITH INSUFFICIENT STABILITY, IT WILL BE A USEFUL TRAINING MODE FOR STRENGTHENING THE MUSCLES THAT HELP TO KEEP ONE UPRIGHT. THIS STUDY QUANTIFIED THE PHYSICAL DEMANDS OF YOGA POSES USING BIOMECHANICAL DATA AND ELUCIDATED THE STRUCTURES AND PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING EACH YOGA MOVEMENT. THIS IS CRUCIAL FOR YOGA PRACTITIONERS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
12 1752  23 PILOT-TESTING THE EFFECTS OF A NEWLY-DEVELOPED SILVER YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM FOR FEMALE SENIORS. THIS STUDY AIMED TO PILOT-TEST THE HEALTH PROMOTION EFFECTS OF A SILVER YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM FOR FEMALE SENIORS. USING A ONE-GROUP, PRE-POST TEST DESIGN, A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF 16 COMMUNITY-DWELLING FEMALE SENIORS WAS RECRUITED. THE SILVER YOGA EXERCISE INTERVENTION WAS ADMINISTERED THREE TIMES A WEEK, 70 MINUTES PER SESSION, FOR FOUR WEEKS. DATA WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE AND AFTER COMPLETION OF THE FOUR-WEEK INTERVENTION. RESULTS INDICATED THAT PARTICIPANTS' BODY FAT PERCENTAGE AND SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE DECREASED, BALANCE AND RANGE OF MOTION ON SHOULDER FLEXION AND ABDUCTION IMPROVED, AND SLEEP DISTURBANCE WAS MINIMIZED (ALL P < .05). PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THAT THE SILVER YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM PROVIDES POSITIVE EFFECTS ON THE PROMOTION OF GOOD HEALTH IN FEMALE SENIORS LIVING IN THE COMMUNITIES.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
13 2454  21 YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR METABOLIC SYNDROME: A NARRATIVE REVIEW. METABOLIC SYNDROME (MS) IS ASSOCIATED WITH A SEDENTARY AND STRESSFUL LIFESTYLE AND AFFECTS UNDERACTIVE PEOPLE DISPROPORTIONATELY. YOGA IS CONSIDERED TO BE A LOW-IMPACT MIND-BODY STRESS-RELIEVING EXERCISE, AND RESEARCHERS ARE INCREASING THEIR FOCUS ON THE BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR MANAGING METABOLIC DISORDERS. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR PHYSICIANS AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS TO UNDERSTAND THE THERAPEUTIC EFFICACY OF YOGA INTERVENTION, IN TERMS OF ITS TYPE, DURATION AND FREQUENCY ON VARIOUS MS RISK FACTORS. THE PRESENT REVIEW SUMMARIZES THE CURRENT SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON MS RISK FACTORS SUCH AS GLUCOSE HOMEOSTASIS MARKERS, LIPID PROFILE, ADIPOCYTOKINES AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS, AND DISCUSSES THE POSSIBLE MECHANISMS OF ACTION. MEDLINE, PUBMED, SCOPUS AND COCHRANE LIBRARY WERE SEARCHED FROM THEIR INCEPTION UP TO DECEMBER 2019, USING THE KEYWORDS "METABOLIC SYNDROME," "DIABETES," "CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES," "OBESITY" AND "YOGA." THE LITERATURE SUMMARIZED IN THIS REVIEW HAVE SHOWN MIXED EFFECTS OF YOGA ON MS RISK FACTORS AND DO NOT PROVIDE ROBUST EVIDENCE FOR ITS EFFICACY. MORE RIGOROUS RESEARCH AND WELL-DESIGNED TRIALS THAT HAVE A HIGHER STANDARD OF METHODOLOGY AND EVALUATE YOGA'S LONG-TERM IMPACTS ON MS ARE NEEDED. UNDERSTANDING YOGA'S BIOCHEMICAL AND MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF ACTION ON VARIOUS METABOLIC PATHWAYS IS ALSO NEEDED.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
14  628  24 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN VEGETARIAN AND OMNIVOROUS YOGA PRACTITIONERS-RESULTS OF A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SURVEY OF US ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS. BACKGROUND: TO EXAMINE THE PREVALENCE OF VEGETARIANISM AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS, AND TO EXPLORE DIFFERENCES AND SIMILARITIES BETWEEN YOGA PRACTITIONERS WHO ALSO USE VEGETARIAN DIET AND THOSE WHO DO NOT. DESIGN AND SETTING: USING CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA FROM THE 2012 NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY (NHIS) (N = 34,525), WEIGHTED FREQUENCIES FOR 12-MONTH PREVALENCE OF VEGETARIAN DIET USE AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS WERE ANALYZED. LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSES WERE USED TO ANALYZE SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL PREDICTORS OF VEGETARIAN DIET USE. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 1.7 MILLION US YOGA PRACTITIONERS HAVE USED A VEGETARIAN DIET IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS (8.3%), COMPARED TO 2.7 MILLION NON-YOGA PRACTITIONERS (1.3%). YOGA PRACTITIONERS WHO WERE AGED BETWEEN 30 AND 64 YEARS AS COMPARED TO BEING 29 YEARS OR YOUNGER WERE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE USED A VEGETARIAN DIET IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS; WHILE THOSE BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP (OR = 0.64), OVERWEIGHT (OR = 0.54), SMOKING (OR 0.64) OR HAVING PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE (OR = 0.59) WERE LESS LIKELY. VEGETARIAN DIET PRACTITIONERS MORE OFTEN INCLUDED MEDITATION AS PART OF THEIR YOGA PRACTICE AND MORE OFTEN CHOSE YOGA BECAUSE IT HAD A HOLISTIC FOCUS, AND WAS PERCEIVED TO TREAT THE CAUSE AND NOT THE SYMPTOMS OF THEIR HEALTH COMPLAINT. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA PRACTITIONERS FOLLOWING A VEGETARIAN DIET SEEM TO EMBRACE YOGA MORE AS A LIFESTYLE THAN AS A THERAPY.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
15 2377  20 WHO PRACTICES YOGA? A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF DEMOGRAPHIC, HEALTH-RELATED, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA PRACTICE. YOGA HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY POPULAR IN THE US AND AROUND THE WORLD, YET BECAUSE MOST YOGA RESEARCH IS CONDUCTED AS CLINICAL TRIALS OR EXPERIMENTS, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE CHARACTERISTICS AND CORRELATES OF PEOPLE WHO INDEPENDENTLY CHOOSE TO PRACTICE YOGA. WE CONDUCTED A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THIS ISSUE, IDENTIFYING 55 STUDIES AND CATEGORIZING CORRELATES OF YOGA PRACTICE INTO SOCIODEMOGRAPHICS, PSYCHOSOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS, AND MENTAL AND PHYSICAL WELL-BEING. YOGA USE IS GREATEST AMONG WOMEN AND THOSE WITH HIGHER SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AND APPEARS FAVORABLY RELATED TO PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS SUCH AS COPING AND MINDFULNESS. YOGA PRACTICE OFTEN RELATES TO BETTER SUBJECTIVE HEALTH AND HEALTH BEHAVIORS BUT ALSO WITH MORE DISTRESS AND PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENT. HOWEVER, EVIDENCE IS SPARSE AND METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS PRECLUDE DRAWING CAUSAL INFERENCES. NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE STUDIES HAVE MINIMALLY ASSESSED YOGA WHILE STUDIES WITH STRONG ASSESSMENT OF YOGA PRACTICE (E.G., TYPE, DOSE) ARE GENERALLY CONDUCTED WITH CONVENIENCE SAMPLES. ALMOST ALL STUDIES REVIEWED ARE CROSS-SECTIONAL AND FEW CONTROL FOR POTENTIAL CONFOUNDING VARIABLES. WE PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CORRELATES OF YOGA PRACTICE.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
16 2534  21 YOGA EMPOWERS SENIORS STUDY (YESS): DESIGN AND ASANA SERIES. THE PRACTICE OF YOGA ASANAS (POSTURES) MAY BE AN OPTIMAL METHOD OF PRESERVING OR ENHANCING PHYSICAL FUNCTION IN OLDER MEN AND WOMEN. HOWEVER, THE PHYSICAL DEMANDS, EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF AN ASANA PRACTICE FOR SENIORS HAVE NOT BEEN WELL STUDIED. THE YOGA EMPOWERS SENIORS STUDY (YESS) IS AN INTERVENTION DEVELOPMENT STUDY THAT CREATED TWO SENIOR-ADAPTED SERIES OF ASANAS TARGETED FOR AN AMBULATORY OLDER POPULATION. YESS IS USING BIOMECHANICS AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE TESTS TO ACQUIRE INFORMATION ABOUT THE PHYSICAL DEMANDS PLACED ON THE MUSCLES AND JOINTS BY THE ASANAS AND THE FUNCTIONAL PERFORMANCE ADAPTATIONS RESULTING FROM THE YOGA PRACTICE. THIS MANUSCRIPT DETAILS THE STANDARDIZED, SENIOR-ADAPTED, YESS ASANA SERIES AND THE ADDITIONAL ASANA MODIFICATIONS PROVIDED WHEN PARTICIPANTS HAD PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS. THIS PRESENTATION WILL ENABLE THE YOGA RESEARCH AND TEACHING COMMUNITIES TO INTERPRET THE BIOMECHANICS, PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE AND SIDE EFFECTS OUTCOMES OF YESS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
17 1445  37 INCREASING TREND OF YOGA PRACTICE AMONG U.S. ADULTS FROM 2002 TO 2017. INTRODUCTION: BENEFITS, RISKS, AND THE INCREASING POPULARITY OF YOGA USE WARRANT ASSESSING YOGA PRACTICE PREVALENCE AND USERS' PROFILES. THIS STUDY DESCRIBES TRENDS IN YOGA PRACTICE EXCLUSIVELY AMONG AMERICAN ADULTS FROM 2002 TO 2017, COMPARES THE PROFILE OF YOGA USERS, AND IDENTIFIES FACTORS RELATED TO YOGA USE OVER TIME. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS STUDY IS A SECONDARY ANALYSIS DONE IN 2019 AND 2020 USING THE NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY (NHIS) 2002, 2007, 2012, AND 2017 DATA. POPULATION WEIGHTS WERE USED TO OBTAIN STATISTICALLY ACCURATE ESTIMATES OF YOGA USE PREVALENCE FOR THE U.S. POPULATION. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS WERE USED TO PROFILE THE SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND HEALTH-RELATED CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA USERS. MULTIVARIABLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION WAS USED TO IDENTIFY FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA USE IN EACH COHORT DEFINED BY THE NHIS YEAR. RESULTS: YOGA PRACTICE PREVALENCE NEARLY TRIPLED FROM 5.1% IN 2002 TO 13.7% IN 2017 (WEIGHTED ESTIMATE 10,386,456 AND 32,761,194 AMERICAN ADULTS, RESPECTIVELY). TYPICAL YOGA USERS WERE YOUNG NON-HISPANIC SINGLE WHITE FEMALE ADULTS WITH BACHELOR OR HIGHER EDUCATION AND HEALTH INSURANCE, AND RESIDED IN THE WEST REGION OF THE UNITED STATES. YOGA USE PATTERN CHANGE OVER TIME WAS SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO ONLY YOUNGER AGE (P < 0.001) BUT NOT TO OTHER SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC OR HEALTH-RELATED FACTORS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA HAS GAINED INCREASING POPULARITY IN THE PAST TWO DECADES AMONG AMERICAN ADULTS, WITH YOUNGER ADULTS BEING THE DRIVING FORCE. YOGA APPEARS TO BE ADOPTED FOR GENERAL WELL-BEING OR PREVENTION MORE THAN FOR SPECIFIC DISEASE TREATMENT. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD EVALUATE HOW YOGA CAN BE EFFECTIVELY AND SAFELY INTEGRATED INTO PREVENTIVE MEDICINE STRATEGIES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
18   68  25 A DIFFERENT WEIGHT LOSS EXPERIENCE: A QUALITATIVE STUDY EXPLORING THE BEHAVIORAL, PHYSICAL, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA THAT PROMOTE WEIGHT LOSS. YOGA INTERVENTIONS IMPROVE OBESITY-RELATED OUTCOMES INCLUDING BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), BODY WEIGHT, BODY FAT, AND WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE, YET IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THESE IMPROVEMENTS ARE DUE TO INCREASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, INCREASED LEAN MUSCLE MASS, AND/OR CHANGES IN EATING BEHAVIORS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXPAND OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE EXPERIENCE OF LOSING WEIGHT THROUGH YOGA. METHODS. SEMISTRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE QUALITATIVELY ANALYZED USING A DESCRIPTIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL APPROACH. RESULTS. TWO DISTINCT GROUPS WHO HAD LOST WEIGHT THROUGH YOGA RESPONDED: THOSE WHO WERE OVERWEIGHT AND HAD REPEATEDLY STRUGGLED IN THEIR ATTEMPTS TO LOSE WEIGHT (55%, N = 11) AND THOSE WHO WERE OF NORMAL WEIGHT AND HAD LOST WEIGHT UNINTENTIONALLY (45%, N = 9). FIVE THEMES EMERGED THAT DIFFERED SLIGHTLY BY GROUP: SHIFT TOWARD HEALTHY EATING, IMPACT OF THE YOGA COMMUNITY/YOGA CULTURE, PHYSICAL CHANGES, PSYCHOLOGICAL CHANGES, AND THE BELIEF THAT THE YOGA WEIGHT LOSS EXPERIENCE WAS DIFFERENT THAN PAST WEIGHT LOSS EXPERIENCES. CONCLUSIONS. THESE FINDINGS IMPLY THAT YOGA COULD OFFER DIVERSE BEHAVIORAL, PHYSICAL, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL EFFECTS THAT MAY MAKE IT A USEFUL TOOL FOR WEIGHT LOSS. ROLE MODELING AND SOCIAL SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THE YOGA COMMUNITY MAY CONTRIBUTE TO WEIGHT LOSS, PARTICULARLY FOR INDIVIDUALS STRUGGLING TO LOSE WEIGHT.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
19 2466  19 YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION: A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF PUBLISHED RESEARCH STUDIES. ALTHOUGH YOGA IS HISTORICALLY A SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE, IT HAS ALSO BEEN USED CLINICALLY AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION. A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS ON THE BIOMEDICAL JOURNAL LITERATURE INVOLVING RESEARCH ON THE CLINICAL APPLICATION OF YOGA HAS REVEALED AN INCREASE IN PUBLICATION FREQUENCY OVER THE PAST 3 DECADES WITH A SUBSTANTIAL AND GROWING USE OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. TYPES OF MEDICAL CONDITIONS HAVE INCLUDED PSYCHOPATHOLOGICAL (E.G. DEPRESSION, ANXIETY), CARDIOVASCULAR (E.G. HYPERTENSION, HEART DISEASE), RESPIRATORY (E.G. ASTHMA), DIABETES AND A VARIETY OF OTHERS. A MAJORITY OF THIS RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONDUCTED BY INDIAN INVESTIGATORS AND PUBLISHED IN INDIAN JOURNALS, PARTICULARLY YOGA SPECIALTY JOURNALS, ALTHOUGH RECENT TRENDS INDICATE INCREASING CONTRIBUTIONS FROM INVESTIGATORS IN THE U.S. AND ENGLAND. YOGA THERAPY IS A RELATIVELY NOVEL AND EMERGING CLINICAL DISCIPLINE WITHIN THE BROAD CATEGORY OF MIND-BODY MEDICINE, WHOSE GROWTH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE BURGEONING POPULARITY OF YOGA IN THE WEST AND THE INCREASING WORLDWIDE USE OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE.	2004	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
20 2025  19 SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS TO PROMOTE CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH IN OLDER ADULTS. THE BENEFITS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ARE WELL ESTABLISHED, YET FEW OLDER ADULTS ENGAGE IN ADEQUATE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO OPTIMIZE HEALTH. WHILE YOGA MAY REDUCE THE RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, FEW STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE EFFICACY OF YOGA-BASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO PROMOTE CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH IN OLDER ADULTS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS REVIEW IS TO PROVIDE AN EVALUATION OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE CARDIOVASCULAR RISK IN OLDER ADULTS. FOUR DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN OLDER ADULTS. STUDIES WITH CARDIOVASCULAR OUTCOMES WERE INCLUDED. LITERATURE SEARCHES IDENTIFIED NINE ARTICLES ELIGIBLE FOR REVIEW. SIGNIFICANT HEALTH BENEFITS WERE REPORTED, INCLUDING FAVORABLE CHANGES IN BLOOD PRESSURE, BODY COMPOSITION, GLUCOSE, AND LIPIDS. YOGA PRACTICES, PARTICIPANT CHARACTERISTICS, AND OUTCOME MEASURES WERE VARIABLE. THERE WAS LIMITED USE OF THEORY. YOGA IS SAFE AND FEASIBLE IN OLDER ADULTS; ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS WARRANTED TO EXAMINE THE SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ESSENTIAL TO REDUCING CARDIOVASCULAR RISK.	2016

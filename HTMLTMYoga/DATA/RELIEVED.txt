1  149 185 A QUALITATIVE EXPLORATION OF THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WITH AROMATASE INHIBITOR-ASSOCIATED ARTHRALGIAS. RESEARCH QUESTION: ARTHRALGIA AFFECTS POSTMENOPAUSAL BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS (BCS) RECEIVING AROMATASE INHIBITORS (AI), WHICH MAY RESULT IN REDUCED FUNCTION AND LONG-TERM WELL-BEING. THIS IS AN EXPLORATORY, QUALITATIVE INVESTIGATION OF BCS WHO PARTICIPATED IN A YOGA-BASED PROGRAM TO UNDERSTAND IMPACT ON JOINT PAIN AND VARIOUS ASPECTS OF QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) THROUGH A YOGA PROGRAM. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK: SOCIAL COGNITIVE THEORY WAS USED AND PROVIDED THE FOUNDATION FOR DEVELOPING A YOGA INTERVENTION THROUGH SOURCES OF EFFICACY INFORMATION: (1) PERFORMANCE ACCOMPLISHMENT, (2) STRUCTURED EXPERIENCE, (3) VERBAL SUPPORT FROM INSTRUCTOR AND GROUP, AND (4) PHYSICAL FEEDBACK. METHODOLOGY: TEN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WITH STAGE I-III BREAST CANCER AND AI ASSOCIATED ARTHRALGIA (AIAA) RECEIVED YOGA TWICE A WEEK FOR EIGHT WEEKS FOR 90 MINUTES AND WERE INSTRUCTED TO CONTINUE IN A HOME-BASED YOGA PROGRAM. WE USED SOCIAL COGNITIVE THEORY (SCT) TO STRUCTURE A YOGA INTERVENTION AS AN ONGOING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO MANAGE JOINT PAIN AND FUNCTION. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED JOURNAL REFLECTIONS ON THEIR EXPERIENCE AND RECEIVED WEEKLY PHONE CALLS. ANALYSIS: DATA WAS COLLECTED AND ANALYZED USING QUALITATIVE METHODS. MEMBER CHECKS WERE COMPLETED AND EMERGENT THEMES WERE EXPLORED AND AGREED UPON BY THE RESEARCH TEAM TO ENSURE RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY OF DATA. SEVERAL EMERGENT THEMES WERE DISCOVERED: EMPOWERMENT: IMPORTANCE OF CAMARADERIE, COMMUNITY, AND SHARING; PAIN RELIEF; INCREASED PHYSICAL FITNESS (ENERGY, FLEXIBILITY, AND FUNCTION); RELIEVED STRESS/ANXIETY AND TRANSFERABILITY OF YOGA THROUGH BREATHING. THESE THEMES WERE IDENTIFIED THROUGH INSTRUCTOR OBSERVATION, PARTICIPANT OBSERVATION, AND WEEKLY PHONE CALL DOCUMENTATION. INTERPRETATION: PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCED AN EIGHT-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION AS AN EFFECTIVE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND SUPPORT GROUP THAT FOSTERED VARIOUS IMPROVEMENTS IN QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AND REDUCTION IN AIAA. PARTICIPANTS WERE HIGHLY MOTIVATED TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL FITNESS LEVELS AND REDUCE PAIN. THIS STUDY REVEALED BENEFITS FROM ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF EXERCISE SUCH AS YOGA TO PROVIDE A STRUCTURE, WHICH IS TRANSFERABLE IN OTHER SITUATIONS. INFORMATION, STRUCTURED PHYSICAL GUIDANCE IN YOGA POSTURES, SUPPORT, AND FEEDBACK ARE NECESSARY TO FOSTER PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOR BCS EXPERIENCING PAIN. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: RESULTS OF THIS QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS INDICATE THAT INTERVENTIONS TO SUPPORT BCS WITH AIAA ARE WARRANTED. YOGA APPEARS TO POSITIVELY IMPACT THESE SIDE EFFECTS OF HORMONAL THERAPIES. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH WOULD AID IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER INTERVENTIONS.	2012	

2  138  25 A PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE ROLE OF YOGA ASANAS ON OXIDATIVE STRESS IN NON-INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS. NINETEEN SUBJECTS OF NON-INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS (NIDDM) BETWEEN THE AGE GROUP OF 30-60 YRS WERE STUDIED TO SEE THE EFFECT OF SPECIFIC YOGA ASANAS ON FASTING AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE (FBG, PPG), SERUM MALONDIALDEHYDE (MDA) AND GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN (HBA(1)) IN ADDITION TO DRUG TREATMENT AND DIET CONTROL. THE DURATION OF DIABETES RANGED FROM 1-10 YEARS. PATIENTS WITH RENAL, CARDIAC AND PROLIFERATIVE RETINAL DISEASES WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE STUDY. THE SAME PATIENTS SERVED AS THEIR OWN CONTROL. SUBJECTS WERE CALLED IN THE MORNING TO THE CARDIO-RESPIRATORY LABORATORY AND WERE GIVEN TRAINING BY A YOGA EXPERT. YOGA ASANAS INCLUDED SURYANAMSKAR, TADASAN, TRIKONASAN, PADMASAN, PRANAYAM, PASCHIMOTTANASAN, ARDHMATSYENDRASAN, PAVANMUKTHASAN, SARPASAN AND SHAVASAN. THE ASANAS WERE DONE EVERY DAY FOR 40 DAYS FOR 30-40 MIN. FBG, PPG, SERUM MDA AND HBA(1) WERE ESTIMATED BEFORE AND AFTER 40 DAYS OF YOGA ASANAS REGIMEN. SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION WAS SEEN IN FBG FROM 220 MG/DL TO 162 MG/DL, PPG FROM 311 MG/DL TO 255 MG/DL, MDA FROM 6 NMOL/L TO 3 NMOL/L AND HBA(1), FROM 8.8% TO 6.4%. SUBJECTS FELT BETTER AND WERE RELIEVED OF THEIR STRESSES AND HAD AN IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR DAY TO DAY PERFORMANCE. THE DECREASE WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P<0.0001 FOR FBG AND PPG, P<0.001 FOR MDA AND FOR HBA(1)).	2001	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
3 1506  28 IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME: YOGA AS REMEDIAL THERAPY. IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME (IBS) IS A GROUP OF SYMPTOMS MANIFESTING AS A FUNCTIONAL GASTROINTESTINAL (GI) DISORDER IN WHICH PATIENTS EXPERIENCE ABDOMINAL PAIN, DISCOMFORT, AND BLOATING THAT IS OFTEN RELIEVED WITH DEFECATION. IBS IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH A HOST OF SECONDARY COMORBIDITIES SUCH AS ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, HEADACHES, AND FATIGUE. IN THIS REVIEW, WE EXAMINED THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF PANCHA KOSHA (FIVE SHEATHS OF HUMAN EXISTENCE) CONCEPT FROM AN INDIAN SCRIPTURE TAITTIRIYA UPANISHAD AND THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF A DISEASE FROM THE YOGA APPROACH, YOGA VASISTHA'S ADHI (ORIGINATED FROM MIND) AND VYADHI (AILMENT/DISEASE) CONCEPT. AN ANALOGY BETWEEN THE AGE OLD, THE MOST PROFOUND CONCEPT OF ADHI-VYADHI, AND MODERN SCIENTIFIC STRESS-INDUCED DYSREGULATION OF BRAIN-GUT AXIS, AS IT RELATES TO IBS THAT COULD PAVE WAY FOR IMPACTING IBS, IS EMPHASIZED. BASED ON THESE PERSPECTIVES, A PLAUSIBLE YOGA MODULE AS A REMEDIAL THERAPY IS PROVIDED TO BETTER MANAGE THE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SYMPTOMS OF IBS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
4  157  46 A QUALITATIVE STUDY ON THE PRACTICE OF YOGA FOR WOMEN WITH PAIN-ASSOCIATED ENDOMETRIOSIS. OBJECTIVES: TO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING WOMEN WITH PAIN-ASSOCIATED ENDOMETRIOSIS ATTRIBUTE TO YOGA PRACTICE REGARDING THEIR PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL STATE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PRACTICE; PAIN MANAGEMENT BY INTEGRATING BODY AND MIND; SECONDARY BENEFITS OF THE PRACTICE OF YOGA, SUCH AS SELF-KNOWLEDGE, SELF-CARE, AND AUTONOMY; AND THE ROLE OF THE YOGA GROUP AS PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT. DESIGN: QUALITATIVE STUDY CONDUCTED SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. SETTING: PUBLIC UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL IN SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL BETWEEN AUGUST 2013 AND DECEMBER 2014. PARTICIPANTS: FIFTEEN WOMEN WITH PAIN-ASSOCIATED ENDOMETRIOSIS WHO PRACTICED YOGA FOR 8 WEEKS. INTERVENTION: AFTER COMPLETING THE TWICE-A-WEEK PROGRAM, ALL WOMEN PARTICIPATED IN A SINGLE, SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW. INTERVIEWS WERE RECORDED AND TRANSCRIBED VERBATIM, AND THEMATIC ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE MAIN THEMES OF ANALYSIS WERE WOMEN'S EXPECTATIONS REGARDING THE PRACTICE OF YOGA, PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL STATE OF WOMEN AT THE BEGINNING OF YOGA PRACTICE, CONTROL AND PAIN MANAGEMENT THROUGH THE INTEGRATION OF BODY AND MIND, SECONDARY BENEFITS, ACQUISITION OF SELF-KNOWLEDGE AND AUTONOMY, AND THE ROLE OF YOGA GROUP AS PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT. RESULTS: ALL PARTICIPANTS REPORTED THAT YOGA WAS BENEFICIAL TO CONTROL PELVIC PAIN. THEY RELATED THAT THEY WERE AWARE OF THE INTEGRATION OF BODY AND PSYCHE DURING YOGA PRACTICE AND THAT THIS HELPED IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PAIN. WOMEN SAID THEY HAD IDENTIFIED A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PAIN MANAGEMENT AND BREATHING TECHNIQUES (PRANAYAMA) LEARNED IN YOGA AND THAT BREATHING INCREASED THEIR ABILITY TO BE INTROSPECTIVE, WHICH RELIEVED PAIN. THE PARTICIPANTS HAVE DEVELOPED GREATER SELF-KNOWLEDGE, AUTONOMY, AND SELF-CARE AND HAVE REDUCED THE USE OF PAIN AND PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATIONS. THEY CREATED TIES AMONG THEMSELVES, SUGGESTING THAT THE YOGA GROUP ALLOWED PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT. CONCLUSIONS: BODILY AND PSYCHOSOCIAL MECHANISMS TO CONTROL PAIN WERE IDENTIFIED IN WOMEN WITH ENDOMETRIOSIS. TO REACH SUCH CONTROL, IT IS CRUCIAL THAT MIND AND BODY INTEGRATIVE TECHNIQUES ARE LEARNED.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
5 1128  34 EFFICACY OF VAMANA KARMA WITH IKSHVAKU KSHEERA YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF TAMAKA SHVASA (BRONCHIAL ASTHMA). INTRODUCTION: BRONCHIAL ASTHMA IS A HIGHLY PREVALENT DISEASE, AND IN MOST OF THE ETIOPATHOGENESIS AND SYMPTOMATOLOGY, IT CAN BE CORRELATED WITH TAMAKA SHVASA. IKSHVAKU (LAGENARIA VULGARIS [MANILA] STANDLEY.) IS AN ANNUAL HERBACEOUS CLIMBING PLANT WITH A LONG HISTORY OF MEDICINAL USES FOR THE TREATMENT OF VARIOUS AILMENTS INCLUDING JAUNDICE, DIABETES, ULCER, PILES, COLITIS, ASTHMA, INSANITY, HYPERTENSION, CONGESTIVE CARDIAC FAILURE AND SKIN DISORDERS. ITS FRUIT PULP IS USED BOTH AS AN EMETIC AND AS A PURGATIVE. AIMS: TO STUDY THE EFFICACY OF VAMANA KARMA WITH IKSHVAKU (LAGENARIA VULGARIS [MANILA] STANDLEY) KSHEERA YOGA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 15 PATIENTS FULFILLING THE DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR BRONCHIAL ASTHMA WERE SELECTED FROM OUTPATIENT AND INPATIENT DEPARTMENT OF PANCHAKARMA DEPARTMENT. THE SIGN AND SYMPTOMS, MAINLY BREATHLESSNESS, COUGH AND RHONCHI WERE GIVEN SCORES DEPENDING ON THEIR SEVERITY. THE PATIENTS WERE ALSO ASSESSED FOR LUNG FUNCTION TEST TO DETERMINE PULMONARY IMPAIRMENT. FOR VAMANA, THEY WERE GIVEN DEEPANA AND PACHANA WITH TRIKATU CHURNA FOR 3 DAYS AND THEN THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO SNEHAPANA WITH LUKEWARM COW'S GHEE. AFTER THE COMPLETION OF SNEHAPANA, THE PATIENT WERE GIVEN ABHYANGA, VASHPA SWEDANA AND DIET WITH PREDOMINANCE OF KAPHA (KAPHA BAHULA AHARA- DIET MIXED WITH MILK OR CURD), WHICH WAS THEN FOLLOWED BY VAMANA WITH IKSHVAKU KSHEERA YOGA AND SAMSARJANA KRAMA. FOLLOW-UP WAS DONE AT AN INTERVAL OF 15 DAYS FOR THREE TIMES AND T SCORES WERE NOTED BEFORE AND AFTER THE TREATMENT. THE SCORES WERE ANALYZED USING WILCOXON SIGNED-RANK TEST FOR SUBJECTIVE PARAMETERS AND STUDENT'S PAIRED T-TEST FOR OBJECTIVE PARAMETERS. RESULTS: THE TRIAL DRUG HAS SHOWN STATISTICALLY HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN BREATHLESSNESS, COUGH, RHONCHI, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN LUNG FUNCTION TESTS. CONCLUSION: THE TEST DRUG PROVED ITS EMETIC EFFECT ON THE PATIENTS OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA AND THUS RELIEVED THE SYMPTOMS OF THE DISEASE IMMEDIATELY. IT HAS REDUCED FREQUENCY OF EPISODES OF BREATHLESSNESS AND SEVERITY OF SYMPTOMS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
6 1456  41 INFLUENCE OF YOGA AND AEROBICS EXERCISE ON FATIGUE, PAIN AND PSYCHOSOCIAL STATUS IN PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: A RANDOMIZED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) IS AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE INVOLVING BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD. WEAKNESS, COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, PAIN, DEPRESSION AND FATIGUE, AS COMMON SYMPTOMS OF MS, MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT ON GENERAL HEALTH OF MS PATIENTS. THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE INFLUENCE OF YOGA AND AEROBIC EXERCISE ON FATIGUE, PAIN, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL STATUS AMONG THESE PATIENTS. METHODS: IN A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL STUDY ON 90 PATIENTS WHOM WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO THREE EQUAL GROUPS OF YOGA EXERCISES, AEROBICS EXERCISES, AND CONTROL GROUP. THE EXERCISE PROGRAM WAS PERFORMED AS THREE SESSIONS PER WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS. THE EXERCISE PROGRAM INCLUDED 40 MINUTES, INCLUDING 5-10 MINUTES FOR WARM-UP, 25-30 MINUTES OF EXERCISE (WALKING), AND 5 MINUTES FOR COOLING DOWN. YOGA EXERCISES WERE SCHEDULED THREE SESSIONS A WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS AS WELL. RESULTS: THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN FATIGUE, PAIN SEVERITY AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STATUS AMONG THREE GROUPS PRIOR TO THE STUDY, BUT AFTER THE STUDY, IN YOGA AND EXERCISE GROUPS, FATIGUE PHYSICAL FUNCTION, PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL ROLE WHICH PATIENTS PLAY THROUGHOUT DAILY LIFE, SOCIAL FUNCTION, ENERGY, MENTAL STATUS AND OVERALL HYGIENE INCREASED, AND THE PAIN AND FATIGUE WERE RELIEVED IN THE PATIENTS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA AND AEROBICS EXERCISE COULD DECREASE SOME OF THE MS SYMPTOMS, THERAPEUTIC COSTS, HOSPITAL STAY, AND DAYS LOST FROM WORK AS WELL AS INCREASING THE PATIENTS' EFFICIENCY.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
7 2303  42 TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA ON PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME. BACKGROUND: EIGHTY PERCENT OF WOMEN DURING THEIR REPRODUCTIVE AGE EXPERIENCE SOME SYMPTOMS ATTRIBUTED TO PREMENSTRUAL PHASE OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE. PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME (PMS) IS CHARACTERIZED BY EMOTIONAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS THAT OCCUR DURING LATE LUTEAL PHASE OF MENSTRUAL CYCLE AND ARE RELIEVED AFTER THE ONSET OF MENSTRUATION. AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA ARE ONE OF THE WAYS TO REDUCE THESE SYMPTOMS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA ON PMS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 72 PARTICIPANTS OF PMS, REFERRED FOR PHYSIOTHERAPY TREATMENT (MEAN AGE 28 YEARS), WERE ENROLLED AND ALLOCATED INTO TWO GROUPS (GROUP A AND B) BY SIMPLE COMPUTERIZED RANDOMIZATION. PATIENTS IN GROUP A RECEIVED AEROBIC EXERCISE AND IN GROUP B RECEIVED YOGA MOVEMENTS FOR 40 MIN, 3 TIMES A WEEK FOR 1 MONTH. THE PAIN INTENSITY (VISUAL ANALOG SCALE) AND PMS SCALE WERE MEASURED BEFORE, AT THE END OF 15 DAYS, AND 1 MONTH OF TREATMENT PROGRAM. RESULTS: DATA WERE ANALYZED BY PAIRED T-TEST, UNPAIRED T-TEST, AND ONE-WAY ANOVA; AND THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT BOTH AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA MOVEMENTS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED PAIN INTENSITY AND PMS SYMPTOMS. SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PMS SYMPTOMS WAS FOUND IN PATIENTS TREATED WITH YOGA COMPARED TO AEROBIC EXERCISE; HOWEVER, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND IN PAIN INTENSITY BETWEEN THESE TWO GROUPS (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: IT IS CONCLUDED THAT BOTH AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA MOVEMENTS ARE EFFECTIVE IN TREATING PMS; HOWEVER, YOGA IS MORE EFFECTIVE IN RELIEVING THE SYMPTOMS OF PMS THAN AEROBIC EXERCISE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
8  781  26 EFFECT OF YOGA ASANAS ON NERVE CONDUCTION IN TYPE 2 DIABETES. TWENTY TYPE 2 DIABETIC SUBJECTS BETWEEN THE AGE GROUP OF 30-60 YEARS WERE STUDIED TO SEE THE EFFECT OF 40 DAYS OF YOGA ASANAS ON THE NERVE CONDUCTION VELOCITY. THE DURATION OF DIABETES RANGED FROM 0-10 YEARS. SUBJECT SUFFERING FROM CARDIAC, RENAL AND PROLIFERATIVE RETINAL COMPLICATIONS WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE STUDY YOGA ASANAS INCLUDED SURYANAMSKAR. TADASAN, KONASAN, PADMASAN PRANAYAM, PASCHIMOTTANSAN ARDHMATSYENDRASAN, SHAVASAN, PAVANMUKTHASAN, SARPASAN AND SHAVASAN. SUBJECTS WERE CALLED TO THE CARDIO-RESPIRATORY LABORATORY IN THE MORNING TIME AND WERE GIVEN TRAINING BY THE YOGA EXPERT. THE YOGA EXERCISES WERE PERFORMED FOR 30-40 MINUTES EVERY DAY FOR 40 DAYS IN THE ABOVE SEQUENCE. THE SUBJECTS WERE PRESCRIBED CERTAIN MEDICINES AND DIET. THE BASAL BLOOD GLUCOSE, NERVE CONDUCTION VELOCITY OF THE MEDIAN NERVE WAS MEASURED AND REPEATED AFTER 40 DAYS OF YOGIC REGIME. ANOTHER GROUP OF 20 TYPE 2 DIABETES SUBJECTS OF COMPARABLE AGE AND SEVERITY, CALLED THE CONTROL GROUP, WERE KEPT ON PRESCRIBED MEDICATION AND LIGHT PHYSICAL EXERCISES LIKE WALKING. THEIR BASAL & POST 40 DAYS PARAMETERS WERE RECORDED FOR COMPARISON. RIGHT HAND AND LEFT HAND MEDIAN NERVE CONDUCTION VELOCITY INCREASED FROM 52.81 +/- 1.1 M/SEC TO 53.87 +/- 1.1 M/SEC AND 52.46 +/- 1.0 TO 54.75 +/- 1/1 M/SEC RESPECTIVELY. CONTROL GROUP NERVE FUNCTION PARAMETERS DETERIORATED OVER THE PERIOD OF STUDY, INDICATING THAT DIABETES IS A SLOWLY PROGRESSIVE DISEASE INVOLVING THE NERVES. YOGA ASANAS HAVE A BENEFICIAL EFFECT ON GLYCAEMIC CONTROL AND IMPROVE NERVE FUNCTION IN MILD TO MODERATE TYPE 2 DIABETES WITH SUB-CLINICAL NEUROPATHY.	2002	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
9 1820  44 PROTOCOL FOR A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY OF IYENGAR YOGA FOR YOUTH WITH IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME. INTRODUCTION: IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME AFFECTS AS MANY AS 14% OF HIGH SCHOOL-AGED STUDENTS. SYMPTOMS INCLUDE DISCOMFORT IN THE ABDOMEN, ALONG WITH DIARRHEA AND/OR CONSTIPATION AND OTHER GASTROENTEROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS THAT CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT QUALITY OF LIFE AND DAILY FUNCTIONING. EMOTIONAL STRESS APPEARS TO EXACERBATE IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME SYMPTOMS SUGGESTING THAT MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS REDUCING AROUSAL MAY PROVE BENEFICIAL. FOR MANY SUFFERERS, SYMPTOMS CAN BE TRACED TO CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE, MAKING THE EARLY MANIFESTATION OF IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND. THE CURRENT STUDY WILL FOCUS ON YOUNG PEOPLE AGED 14-26 YEARS WITH IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME. THE STUDY WILL TEST THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF IYENGAR YOGA ON CLINICAL SYMPTOMS, PSYCHOSPIRITUAL FUNCTIONING AND VISCERAL SENSITIVITY. YOGA IS THOUGHT TO BRING PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SPIRITUAL BENEFITS TO PRACTITIONERS AND HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED STRESS AND PAIN. THROUGH ITS FOCUS ON RESTORATION AND USE OF PROPS, IYENGAR YOGA IS ESPECIALLY DESIGNED TO DECREASE AROUSAL AND PROMOTE PSYCHOSPIRITUAL RESOURCES IN PHYSICALLY COMPROMISED INDIVIDUALS. AN EXTENSIVE AND STANDARDIZED TEACHER-TRAINING PROGRAM SUPPORT IYENGAR YOGA'S RELIABILITY AND SAFETY. IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT YOGA WILL BE FEASIBLE WITH LESS THAN 20% ATTRITION; AND THE YOGA GROUP WILL DEMONSTRATE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED OUTCOMES COMPARED TO CONTROLS, WITH PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOSPIRITUAL MECHANISMS CONTRIBUTING TO IMPROVEMENTS. METHODS/DESIGN: SIXTY IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME PATIENTS AGED 14-26 WILL BE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A STANDARDIZED 6-WEEK TWICE WEEKLY IYENGAR YOGA GROUP-BASED PROGRAM OR A WAIT-LIST USUAL CARE CONTROL GROUP. THE GROUPS WILL BE COMPARED ON THE PRIMARY CLINICAL OUTCOMES OF IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME SYMPTOMS, QUALITY OF LIFE AND GLOBAL IMPROVEMENT AT POST-TREATMENT AND 2-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. SECONDARY OUTCOMES WILL INCLUDE VISCERAL PAIN SENSITIVITY ASSESSED WITH A STANDARDIZED LABORATORY TASK (WATER LOAD TASK), FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY AND PSYCHOSPIRITUAL VARIABLES INCLUDING CATASTROPHIZING, SELF-EFFICACY, MOOD, ACCEPTANCE AND MINDFULNESS. MECHANISMS OF ACTION INVOLVED IN THE PROPOSED BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA UPON CLINICAL OUTCOMES WILL BE EXPLORED, AND INCLUDE THE MEDIATING EFFECTS OF VISCERAL SENSITIVITY, INCREASED PSYCHOSPIRITUAL RESOURCES, REGULATED AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM RESPONSES AND REGULATED HORMONAL STRESS RESPONSE ASSESSED VIA SALIVARY CORTISOL.

10  526  29 COMPARISON OF LAUGHTER YOGA AND ANTI-ANXIETY MEDICATION ON ANXIETY AND GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS OF PATIENTS WITH IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME. BACKGROUND IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME (IBS) IS THE MOST COMMON CHRONIC GASTROINTESTINAL (GI) DISORDER. PATIENTS WITH IBS USUALLY SUFFER FROM ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. A COMBINATION OF PSYCHOLOGICAL APPROACHES AND PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENTS CAN BE A SIGNIFICANTLY EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR IBS. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO PROVIDE A THERAPEUTIC PLAN BASED ON LAUGHTER YOGA AND ANTI-ANXIETY MEDICATION, EMPLOYED FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME, AND TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE TREATMENTS ON THE ANXIETY AND GI SYMPTOMS OF PATIENTS WITH IBS. METHODS IN THIS RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED, CLINICAL TRIAL, THE PARTICIPANTS WERE 60 PATIENTS SELECTED FROM THOSE WHO REFERRED TO THE GI CLINIC OF VALI-ASR HOSPITAL (BIRJAND, IRAN) DURING THE STUDY PERIOD (APRIL 2017 TO MARCH 2017) AND WERE DIAGNOSED AS HAVING IBS BASED ON ROME III CRITERIA. THE PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER THE LAUGHTER YOGA GROUP, THE ANTI-ANXIETY MEDICATION GROUP, OR THE SYMPTOMATIC TREATMENT (CONTROL) GROUP. SEVERITY LEVELS OF ANXIETY AND GI SYMPTOMS BEFORE AND AFTER INTERVENTION WERE DETERMINED AND COMPARED AMONG THESE THREE GROUPS ACCORDING TO APPROVED PROTOCOLS. RESULTS THE SEVERITY OF IBS SYMPTOMS AFTER THE INTERVENTIONS WAS MORE GREATLY REDUCED IN THE LAUGHTER YOGA GROUP THAN IN THE ANTI-ANXIETY MEDICATION AND CONTROL GROUPS (P = 0.006). THE SEVERITY OF ANXIETY AFTER INTERVENTIONS DECREASED IN ALL THREE GROUPS, ESPECIALLY IN THE YOGA TREATMENT GROUP, BUT THE DIFFERENCE WAS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P = 0.1). CONCLUSION LAUGHTER YOGA IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN ANTI-ANXIETY MEDICATION IN REDUCING THE GI SYMPTOMS OF PATIENTS WITH IBS. THEREFORE, APPLYING LAUGHTER YOGA ALONG WITH COMMON PHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPIES FOR PATIENTS WITH IBS MIGHT BE STRONGLY ADVISED.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
11 2300  31 THERAPEUTIC YOGA: SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) IS THE MOST COMMON AUTOIMMUNE INFLAMMATORY DEMYELINATING DISEASE OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM, AFFECTING OVER 2.3 MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE, THE AGE OF DISEASE ONSET IS TYPICALLY BETWEEN 20 AND 40 YEARS, WITH A HIGHER INCIDENCE IN WOMEN. INDIVIDUALS WITH MS EXPERIENCE A WIDE RANGE OF SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING DECLINING PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS (E.G., FATIGUE, IMBALANCE, SPASTICITY, CHRONIC PAIN, COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, BLADDER AND BOWEL DYSFUNCTION, VISUAL AND SPEECH IMPAIRMENTS, DEPRESSION, SENSORY DISTURBANCE, AND MOBILITY IMPAIRMENT). TO DATE, BOTH THE CAUSE OF AND CURE FOR MS REMAIN UNKNOWN. IN RECENT YEARS, MORE INDIVIDUALS WITH MS HAVE BEEN PURSUING ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF TREATMENT TO MANAGE SYMPTOMS OF THE DISEASE, INCLUDING MIND-BODY THERAPIES SUCH AS YOGA, MEDITATION, BREATHING, AND RELAXATION TECHNIQUES. IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT THE PRACTICE OF YOGA MAY BE A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE WAY OF MANAGING SYMPTOMS OF MS. THEREFORE, THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO SUMMARIZE THE MOST RELEVANT LITERATURE ON EXERCISE AND MIND-BODY MODALITIES TO TREAT MS SYMPTOMS AND, MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE BENEFITS AND POTENTIAL ROLE OF YOGA AS AN ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT OF SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH MS.

12  519  27 COMPARING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA & ORAL CALCIUM ADMINISTRATION IN ALLEVIATING SYMPTOMS OF PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME IN MEDICAL UNDERGRADUATES. INTRODUCTION: MEDICAL UNDERGRADUATES ARE HEAVILY BURDENED BY THEIR CURRICULUM. THE FEMALES, IN ADDITION, SUFFER FROM VIVID AFFECTIVE OR SOMATIC PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME (PMS) SYMPTOMS SUCH AS BLOATING, MASTALGIA, INSOMNIA, FATIGUE, MOOD SWINGS, IRRITABILITY, AND DEPRESSION. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS PROPOSED TO ATTENUATE THE SYMPTOMS OF PMS BY SIMPLE LIFESTYLE MEASURES LIKE YOGA AND/OR ORAL CALCIUM. METHODS: 65 MEDICAL FEMALE STUDENTS (18-22 YEARS) WITH A REGULAR MENSTRUAL CYCLE WERE ASKED TO SELF-RATE THEIR SYMPTOMS, ALONG WITH THEIR SEVERITY, IN A VALIDATED QUESTIONNAIRE FOR TWO CONSECUTIVE MENSTRUAL CYCLES. FIFTY-EIGHT STUDENTS WERE FOUND TO HAVE PMS. TWENTY GIRLS WERE GIVEN YOGA TRAINING (45 MINUTES DAILY, FIVE DAYS A WEEK, FOR THREE MONTHS). ANOTHER GROUP OF 20 WAS GIVEN ORAL TABLETS OF CALCIUM CARBONATE DAILY (500 MG, FOR THREE MONTHS) AND REST 18 GIRL SERVED AS CONTROL GROUP. DATA WERE ANALYZED BY SPSS VER.13 SOFTWARE. RESULTS: THE YOGA AND CALCIUM GROUPS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN NUMBER AND SEVERITY OF PREMENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS WHEREAS IN THE CONTROL GROUP THERE WAS NOT THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE. CONCLUSION: ENCOURAGING A REGULAR PRACTICE OF YOGA OR TAKING A TABLET OF CALCIUM DAILY IN THE MEDICAL SCHOOLS CAN DECREASE THE SYMPTOMS OF PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
13 1126  43 EFFICACY OF STRUCTURED YOGA INTERVENTION FOR SLEEP, GASTROINTESTINAL AND BEHAVIOUR PROBLEMS OF ASD CHILDREN: AN EXPLORATORY STUDY. INTRODUCTION: AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (ASD) IS A NEURO DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER WHICH APPEARS AT EARLY CHILDHOOD AGE BETWEEN 18 AND 36 MONTHS. APART FROM BEHAVIOUR PROBLEMS ASD CHILDREN ALSO SUFFER FROM SLEEP AND GASTROINTESTINAL (GI) PROBLEMS. MAJOR BEHAVIOUR PROBLEMS OF ASD CHILDREN ARE LACK OF SOCIAL COMMUNICATION AND INTERACTION, LESS ATTENTION SPAN, REPETITIVE AND RESTRICTIVE BEHAVIOUR, LACK OF EYE TO EYE CONTACT, AGGRESSIVE AND SELF-INJURIOUS BEHAVIOURS, SENSORY INTEGRATION PROBLEMS, MOTOR PROBLEMS, DEFICIENCY IN ACADEMIC ACTIVITIES, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION ETC. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT STRUCTURED YOGA INTERVENTION WILL BRINGS SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE PROBLEMS OF ASD CHILDREN. AIM: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO FIND OUT EFFICACY OF STRUCTURED YOGA INTERVENTION FOR SLEEP PROBLEMS, GASTROINTESTINAL PROBLEMS AND BEHAVIOUR PROBLEMS OF ASD CHILDREN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IT WAS AN EXPLORATORY STUDY WITH PRE-TEST AND POST-TEST CONTROL DESIGN. THREE SETS OF QUESTIONNAIRES HAVING 61 QUESTIONS DEVELOPED BY RESEARCHERS WERE USED TO COLLECT DATA PRE AND POST YOGA INTERVENTION. QUESTIONNAIRES WERE BASED ON THREE PROBLEMATIC AREAS OF ASD CHILDREN AS MENTIONED ABOVE AND WERE ADMINISTERED TO PARENTS BY TEACHERS UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF RESEARCHER AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGISTS. EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS GIVEN YOGA INTERVENTION FOR A PERIOD OF 90 DAYS AND CONTROL GROUP CONTINUED WITH SCHOOL CURRICULUM. RESULTS: BOTH CHILDREN AND PARENTS PARTICIPATED IN THIS INTERVENTION. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE SEEN POST YOGA INTERVENTION IN THREE AREAS OF PROBLEMS AS MENTIONED ABOVE. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS ALSO SHOWED SIGNIFICANCE VALUE OF 0.001 IN THE RESULT. CONCLUSION: STRUCTURED YOGA INTERVENTION CAN BE CONDUCTED FOR A LARGE GROUP OF ASD CHILDREN WITH PARENT'S INVOLVEMENT. YOGA CAN BE USED AS ALTERNATIVE THERAPY TO REDUCE THE SEVERITY OF SYMPTOMS OF ASD CHILDREN.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
14 2412  36 YOGA AND ITS IMPACT ON CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY AUTOIMMUNE ARTHRITIS. RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA) IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES, WHICH ADVERSELY AFFECTS THE QUALITY OF LIFE. RA IS A DISEASE OF UNKNOWN ETIOLOGY, HOWEVER, BOTH GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS APPEAR TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUSCEPTIBILITY TO THIS DISEASE. THE SEVERITY AND PROGRESSION OF THE DISEASE ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RELEASE OF A HOST OF INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES, CYTOTOXIC AND IMMUNE REGULATORY FACTORS. THE TREATMENTS OF RA ARE PRIMARILY LIMITED TO SYMPTOMATIC ALLEVIATION OF PAIN OR OTHER SYMPTOMS OR TO THE USE OF CYTOTOXIC DRUG TREATMENT IN SEVERE FORMS OF THE DISEASE WHICH IS COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT SIDE EFFECTS. DESPITE LACK OF A CURE, THE DISEASE MAY BE CONTROLLED BY MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS. HOLISTIC TREATMENTS SUCH AS YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE AND REDUCE THE PSYCHO-SOMATIC SYMPTOMS, PAIN PERCEPTION, DISABILITY QUOTIENT, JOINT FLEXIBILITY, RANGE OF MOTION, POSTURE, MUSCLE STRENGTH, COORDINATION, AND DISEASE ACTIVITY. HERE, WE DISCUSS THE FEATURES OF RA AND ADDRESS HOW YOGA CAN BE USED AS A THERAPEUTIC REGIMEN TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF PATIENTS WITH RA.	2021

16  783  29 EFFECT OF YOGA BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION ON STATE AND TRAIT ANXIETY. CONSIDERABLE EVIDENCE EXISTS FOR THE PLACE OF MIND BODY MEDICINE IN THE TREATMENT OF ANXIETY DISORDERS. EXCESSIVE ANXIETY IS MALADAPTIVE. IT IS OFTEN CONSIDERED TO BE THE MAJOR COMPONENT OF UNHEALTHY LIFESTYLE THAT CONTRIBUTES SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE PATHOGENESIS OF NOT ONLY PSYCHIATRIC BUT ALSO MANY OTHER SYSTEMIC DISORDERS. AMONG THE APPROACHES TO REDUCE THE LEVEL OF ANXIETY HAS BEEN THE SEARCH FOR HEALTHY LIFESTYLES. THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO STUDY THE SHORT-TERM IMPACT OF A COMPREHENSIVE BUT BRIEF LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION, BASED ON YOGA, ON ANXIETY LEVELS IN NORMAL AND DISEASED SUBJECTS. THE STUDY WAS THE RESULT OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH CARRIED OUT IN THE INTEGRAL HEALTH CLINIC (IHC) AT THE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSIOLOGY OF ALL INDIA INSTITUTE OF MEDICAL SCIENCES. THE SUBJECTS HAD HISTORY OF HYPERTENSION, CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE, DIABETES MELLITUS, OBESITY, PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS (DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, 'STRESS'), GASTROINTESTINAL PROBLEMS (NON ULCER DYSPEPSIA, DUODENAL ULCERS, IRRITABLE BOWEL DISEASE, CROHN'S DISEASE, CHRONIC CONSTIPATION) AND THYROID DISORDERS (HYPERTHYROIDISM AND HYPOTHYROIDISM). THE INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF ASANAS, PRANAYAMA, RELAXATION TECHNIQUES, GROUP SUPPORT, INDIVIDUALIZED ADVICE, AND LECTURES AND FILMS ON PHILOSOPHY OF YOGA, THE PLACE OF YOGA IN DAILY LIFE, MEDITATION, STRESS MANAGEMENT, NUTRITION, AND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE ILLNESS. THE OUTCOME MEASURES WERE ANXIETY SCORES, TAKEN ON THE FIRST AND LAST DAY OF THE COURSE. ANXIETY SCORES, BOTH STATE AND TRAIT ANXIETY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED. AMONG THE DISEASED SUBJECTS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT WAS SEEN IN THE ANXIETY LEVELS OF PATIENTS OF HYPERTENSION, CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE, OBESITY, CERVICAL SPONDYLITIS AND THOSE WITH PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS. THE OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT A SHORT EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMME FOR LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AND STRESS MANAGEMENT LEADS TO REMARKABLE REDUCTION IN THE ANXIETY SCORES WITHIN A PERIOD OF 10 DAYS.	2006	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
17 1405  59 IMPACT OF YOGA ON FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WITH AROMATASE INHIBITOR-ASSOCIATED ARTHRALGIAS. ARTHRALGIA AFFECTS POSTMENOPAUSAL BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS (BCSS) RECEIVING AROMATASE INHIBITORS (AIS). THIS STUDY AIMS TO ESTABLISH THE FEASIBILITY OF STUDYING THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON OBJECTIVE FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES, PAIN, AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HR-QOL) FOR AI-ASSOCIATED ARTHRALGIA (AIAA). POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WITH STAGE I TO III BREAST CANCER WHO REPORTED AIAA WERE ENROLLED IN A SINGLE-ARM PILOT TRIAL. A YOGA PROGRAM WAS PROVIDED TWICE A WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS. THE FUNCTIONAL REACH (FR) AND SIT AND REACH (SR) WERE EVALUATED AS PRIMARY OUTCOMES. PAIN, AS MEASURED BY THE BRIEF PAIN INVENTORY (BPI), SELF-REPORTED PATIENT SPECIFIC FUNCTIONAL SCALE (PSFS), AND FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CANCER THERAPY-BREAST (FACT-B) WERE SECONDARY OUTCOMES. PAIRED T TESTS WERE USED FOR ANALYSIS, AND 90% PROVIDED DATA FOR ASSESSMENT AT THE END OF THE INTERVENTION. PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN BALANCE, AS MEASURED BY FR, AND FLEXIBILITY, AS MEASURED BY SR. THE PSFS IMPROVED FROM 4.55 TO 7.21, AND HR-QOL MEASURED BY FACT-B ALSO IMPROVED; BOTH P < .05. THE SCORE FOR THE PAIN SEVERITY SUBSCALE OF THE BPI REDUCED. NO ADVERSE EVENTS NOR DEVELOPMENT OR WORSENING OF LYMPHEDEMA WAS OBSERVED. IN ALL, 80% OF PARTICIPANTS ADHERED TO THE HOME PROGRAM. PRELIMINARY DATA SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY REDUCE PAIN AND IMPROVE BALANCE AND FLEXIBILITY IN BCSS WITH AIAA. A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IS NEEDED TO ESTABLISH THE DEFINITIVE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR OBJECTIVE FUNCTIONAL IMPROVEMENT IN BCSS RELATED TO AIAA.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
18  321  36 ANALOGY BETWEEN CLASSICAL YOGA/ZEN BREATHING AND MODERN CLINICAL RESPIRATORY THERAPY. ANESTHESIOLOGISTS AND INTENSIVISTS ARE MODERN-DAY PROFESSIONALS WHO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE RESPIRATORY CARE, VITAL FOR PATIENT SURVIVAL. RECENTLY, ANESTHESIOLOGISTS HAVE INCREASINGLY FOCUSED THEIR ATTENTION ON THE TYPE OF SPONTANEOUS BREATHING MADE BY NON-INTUBATED PATIENTS WITH PULMONARY DISEASE CARED FOR IN AN INTENSIVE CARE UNIT, AND ALSO PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC PAIN RECEIVING COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY. PRIOR TO OUR MODERN UNDERSTANDING OF RESPIRATORY PHYSIOLOGY, ZEN MEDITATORS RECOGNIZED THAT BREATHING HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON A PERSON'S MENTAL STATE AND GENERAL PHYSICAL WELL-BEING. EXAMPLES OF THIS KNOWLEDGE REGARDING RESPIRATION INCLUDE THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF DEEP INHALATION AND SLOW EXHALATION ON ANXIETY AND GENERAL WELLNESS. THE CLASSICAL LITERATURE HAS NOTED MANY SUGGESTIONS FOR BREATHING AND ITS PSYCHO-PHYSICAL EFFECTS. IN THE PRESENT REVIEW, WE EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF CLASSICAL BREATHING METHODS AND FIND AN ANALOGY BETWEEN TYPICAL YOGA/ZEN BREATHING AND MODERN CLINICAL RESPIRATORY THERAPY. EVIDENCE IS INCREASING ABOUT HISTORICAL BREATHING AND RELATED MEDITATION TECHNIQUES THAT MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN MODERN CLINICAL PRACTICE, ESPECIALLY IN THE FIELD OF ANESTHESIOLOGY, SUCH AS IN IMPROVING RESPIRATORY FUNCTION AND REDUCING CHRONIC PAIN. CLARIFICATION OF THE DETAILED MECHANISMS INVOLVED IS ANTICIPATED.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
19 2283  35 THE USE OF INTEGRATIVE THERAPY BASED ON YOGA AND AYURVEDA IN THE TREATMENT OF A HIGH-RISK CASE OF COVID-19/SARS-COV-2 WITH MULTIPLE COMORBIDITIES: A CASE REPORT. BACKGROUND: WE REPORT A HIGH-RISK CASE OF A CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 19 (COVID-19)-POSITIVE PATIENT WITH COMORBIDITIES INCLUDING DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), HYPERTENSION (HTN), HYPOTHYROIDISM AND CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (CKD), TREATED SUCCESSFULLY USING AN INTEGRATIVE THERAPY PLAN BASED ON AYURVEDA AND YOGA, ALONG WITH GOVERNMENT-MANDATED COMPULSORY MODERN WESTERN MEDICINE (MWM) TREATMENT. RECENTLY, SOME EVIDENCE HAS BEEN EMERGING ON THE USE OF AYURVEDA FOR TREATMENT OF COVID-19. THE CLASSICAL TEXTS OF AYURVEDIC MEDICINE SUCH AS CHARAKA SAMHITA AND SUSHRUTA SAMHITA CONTAIN DESCRIPTIONS OF PANDEMICS OF SIMILAR PROPORTIONS AND DESCRIBE THEM AS JANAPADODDHVANSA, MEANING THE DESTRUCTION OF COMMUNITIES, ALONG WITH THEIR CAUSES AND TREATMENT. CASE PRESENTATION: THE CASE REPORTED HEREIN IS A 55-YEAR-OLD MAN FROM DELHI, INDIA, WITH CONFIRMED (TESTED) COVID-19, WHO FIRST TOOK MWM FOR 7 DAYS BEFORE SEEKING INTEGRATIVE THERAPY. THE PATIENT HAS COMORBIDITIES INCLUDING DM, HTN, HYPOTHYROIDISM AND CKD AND HAD DEVELOPED SYMPTOMS INCLUDING FEVER (WHICH WAS RESOLVED BY THE TIME INTEGRATIVE THERAPY WAS STARTED), SORE THROAT, DRY COUGH, BODY ACHES, WEAKNESS, BAD TASTE AND SMELL, AND HEAVINESS IN THE ABDOMEN. BASED ON THE PATIENT'S SYMPTOMS AND COMORBIDITIES, A TREATMENT PLAN INCLUDING AYURVEDIC MEDICINES, YOGA PROTOCOL, DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS AND LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS WAS PRESCRIBED BY A REGISTERED AYURVEDA DOCTOR AND A YOGA CONSULTANT. THE PATIENT STARTED EXPERIENCING IMPROVEMENT IN ALL THE SYMPTOMS WITHIN 2 DAYS AFTER STARTING THE TREATMENT; HE REPORTED APPROXIMATELY [FORMULA: SEE TEXT] RELIEF FROM THE SYMPTOMS AFTER 5 DAYS, AND ALMOST COMPLETE RELIEF WITHIN 9 DAYS. ALSO, THE BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS (BOTH FASTING BLOOD SUGAR [FBS] AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD SUGAR [PPBS]) EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT AFTER 5 DAYS, AND DECREASED TO WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE WITHIN 12 DAYS. BESIDES RELIEF IN SYMPTOMS, THE PATIENT'S REAL-TIME REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (RT-PCR) TEST DONE ON THE 19TH DAY RETURNED NEGATIVE RESULTS. CONCLUSIONS: INTEGRATIVE THERAPY WAS FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE IN MITIGATING THE SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19 IN THIS PATIENT WITH MULTIPLE COMORBIDITIES. MOREOVER, A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS (NOT UNDER CONTROL WITH MODERN MEDICINE) WAS ALSO ACHIEVED. INTEGRATIVE THERAPY BASED ON THE CLASSICAL TEXTS OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA MAY OFFER A PROMISING AND SCALABLE TREATMENT OPTION FOR COVID-19 PATIENTS. A CASE SERIES OR A SUITABLY DESIGNED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IS NEEDED TO ASSESS ITS EFFICACY.	2021	
                        
20 1918  27 ROLE OF YOGA AND MEDITATION AS COMPLIMENTARY THERAPEUTIC REGIME FOR STRESS-RELATED NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS: UTILIZATION OF BRAIN WAVES ACTIVITY AS NOVEL TOOL. DURING RECENT DECADES, STRESS-RELATED NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS SUCH AS ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, CHRONIC TENSION HEADACHE, AND MIGRAINE HAVE ESTABLISHED THEIR STRONGHOLD IN THE LIVES OF A VAST NUMBER OF PEOPLE WORLDWIDE. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS GLOBAL PHENOMENON, INTENSIVE STUDIES HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT LEADING TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF DRUGS LIKE ANTI-DEPRESSANTS, ANXIOLYTICS, AND ANALGESICS WHICH ALTHOUGH HELP IN COMBATING THE SYMPTOMS OF SUCH DISORDERS BUT ALSO CREATE LONG-TERM SIDE EFFECTS. THUS, AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO SUCH CLINICAL PRACTICES, VARIOUS COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES SUCH AS YOGA AND MEDITATION HAVE BEEN PROVED TO BE EFFECTIVE IN ALLEVIATING THE CAUSES AND SYMPTOMS OF DIFFERENT NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS. THE ROLE OF ALTERED BRAIN WAVES IN THIS CONTEXT HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AND NEEDS TO BE PURSUED AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. THUS, THE CURRENT STUDY PROVIDES A REVIEW FOCUSED ON DESCRIBING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND MEDITATION ON ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AS WELL AS EXPLORING BRAIN WAVES AS A TOOL FOR ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL OF THESE COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES FOR SUCH DISORDERS.	2020

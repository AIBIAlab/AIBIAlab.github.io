1 2288 112 THE YOGA MAT TECHNIQUE IN POSTLESS HIP ARTHROSCOPY. HIP ARTHROSCOPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF FEMOROACETABULAR IMPINGEMENT SYNDROME WITH ANTI-SLIDING TECHNIQUES AND WITHOUT THE USE OF A PERINEAL POST TO ACHIEVE HIP DISTRACTION HAS INCREASED GREATLY IN THE PAST 5 TO 10 YEARS. TO ACCESS THE HIP JOINT, DISTRACTION IS MANDATORY TO TREAT INTRA-ARTICULAR DISORDERS SUCH AS LABRAL TEARS, ACETABULAR CARTILAGE DEFECTS, LOOSE BODIES, LIGAMENTUM TERES TEARS, AND AVASCULAR NECROSIS OF THE HIP. IN HIP DISTRACTION, COUNTER-DISTRACTION IS NEEDED, AND THIS IS ACHIEVED WITH A BULKY AND CUSHIONED PERINEAL POST. MOST OF THE DESCRIBED TECHNIQUES IN HIP ARTHROSCOPY WORLDWIDE USE A PERINEAL POST, BUT IATROGENIC PUDENDAL NERVE, GENITAL LACERATIONS, HEMATOMAS, AND GROIN COMPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO OCCUR. IN LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, DISPOSABLE HIP PAD DEVICES ARE EXPENSIVE, AND NOT ALL THE ARTHROSCOPIC COMPANIES PROVIDE THEM. OUR YOGA MAT TECHNIQUE PROVIDES ENOUGH COUNTERTRACTION TO ACHIEVE ADEQUATE HIP DISTRACTION. LABRAL REPAIR, LABRAL RECONSTRUCTION, AND DECOMPRESSION OF FEMOROACETABULAR IMPINGEMENT SYNDROME HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED PROPERLY, RELIABLY, AND REPRODUCIBLY, AND NO TRENDELENBURG POSITION IS NEEDED. POSTLESS HIP ARTHROSCOPY IS MADE SIMPLE, AND POSITIONING THE PATIENT IS NOT DIFFICULT. HIP SURGEONS CAN ADAPT THIS TECHNIQUE TO A FRACTURE TABLE, A HIP DISTRACTOR, AND A STANDARD OPERATING ROOM TABLE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
2 1656  14 MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURIES RELATED TO YOGA: IMAGING OBSERVATIONS. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO DESCRIBE THE IMAGING APPEARANCES OF MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURIES RELATED TO YOGA. WE PERFORMED AN AUTOMATED SEARCH IN THE DATABASE OF A LARGE TERTIARY CARE CENTER AND CONDUCTED A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE IMAGING FINDINGS IN 38 PATIENTS OVER A 9-YEAR PERIOD. CONCLUSION: THE MOST FREQUENTLY ENCOUNTERED MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURIES WERE TENDINOUS LESIONS, INCLUDING TEARS OF THE SUPRASPINATUS, ACHILLES, AND PERONEUS BREVIS TENDONS AND FIBROCARTILAGINOUS TEARS INVOLVING THE MEDIAL MENISCUS, ACETABULAR LABRUM, GLENOID LABRUM, AND LUMBAR DISK WITH EXTRUSION.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
3 2914  16 [SPONTANOUS PNEUMOMEDIASTINUM AFTER YOGA PRACTICE - A CASE REPORT]. PNEUMOMEDIASTINUM IS DEFINED AS INTERSTITIAL AIR IN THE MEDIASTINUM, WITHOUT ANY APPARENT PRECIPATING FACTOR SUCH AS TRAUMA, OESOPHAGEAL PERFORATION OR INFECTIONS. IT IS VERY UNCOMMON AND USUALLY AFFECTS YOUNG OTHERWISE HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS. THE MOST COMMON SYMTOMS ARE CHEST PAIN AND DYSPNEA WITH SUBCUTANEOUS EMPHYSEMA FOUND ON EXAMINATION. TREATMENT IS USUALLY CONSERVATIVE WITH PAIN RELIEF. HERE, WE PRESENT AN UNUSUAL CASE OF A 23-YEAR-OLD PREVIOUSLY HEALTHY MALE WHO WAS DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMOMEDIASTINUM AFTER PRACTISING YOGA. THIS CASE DEMONSTRATES THE NEED TO STUDY PATIENTS WITH CHEST PAIN OF UNKNOWN CAUSE IN DETAILS TO FIND CAUSES.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
4 2911  22 [PSEUDOARTHROSIS OF THE FIRST RIB IN A PATIENT WHO PRACTICES YOGA. A CASE REPORT]. INTRODUCTION: PSEUDOARTHROSIS OF THE FIRST RIB IS A RARE CONDITION THAT MAY OCCUR IN ATHLETES AS A RESULT OF REPETITIVE ACTIVITIES, MAINLY OVERHEAD. THE USUAL CLINICAL PRESENTATION IS PAIN IN THE NECK OR THE IPSILATERAL SHOULDER. CASE REPORT: THIS IS THE CASE OF A 19-YEAR-OLD FEMALE PATIENT WHO HAD SUDDEN PAIN OF THE BASE OF THE NECK WHILE DOING YOGA. PSEUDOARTHROSIS OF THE FIRST RIB WAS DIAGNOSED WITH X-RAYS AND CAT SCAN. TREATMENT CONSISTED OF A REHABILITATION AND PHYSICAL THERAPY PROGRAM THAT WAS SUCCESSFUL DESPITE THE PERSISTENCE OF THE PSEUDOARTHROSIS. DISCUSSION: CASES OF FIRST RIB FRACTURES HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN ATHLETES PRACTICING MULTIPLE ACTIVITIES; HOWEVER, PSEUDOARTHROSIS CASES ARE RARE SINCE MOST OF THEM PROGRESS TO BONE HEALING. THIS IS THE FIRST REPORTED CASE OF A FRACTURE OR PSEUDOARTHROSIS IN A PATIENT PRACTICING YOGA. AS IN MOST REPORTED CASES, CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT WAS SUCCESSFUL. CONCLUSION: FRACTURES AND PSEUDOARTHROSIS OF THE FIRST RIB ARE RARE IN ATHLETES AND SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF ATHLETES PRESENTING WITH SHOULDER AND NECK PAIN. CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT IS SUCCESSFUL IN MOST CASES.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
5 2873  20 YOGA-INDUCED MYOSITIS OSSIFICANS TRAUMATICA OF THE SCAPHOLUNATE LIGAMENT. BACKGROUND MYOSITIS OSSIFICANS TRAUMATICA (MOT) INVOLVES THE HETEROTOPIC DEVELOPMENT OF LAMELLAR BONE AFTER A TRAUMATIC INJURY. DESPITE BEING TERMED "MYOSITIS," MOT IS NOT LIMITED TO MUSCLE BUT RATHER CAN INVOLVE TENDONS, FAT, AND FASCIA. "TRAUMATICA" REFLECTS THAT LESIONS ARE USUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH A HISTORY OF SIGNIFICANT TRAUMA, THAT IS, FRACTURES OR SURGERY; HOWEVER, MANY REPORTS SUGGEST THEY CAN ALSO BE LINKED TO REPETITIVE LOW-ENERGY INSULTS. IN BOTH CASES, THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE SECONDARY TO TISSUE INJURY GENERATES A PROLIFERATIVE OSTEOBLASTIC CASCADE. CASE DESCRIPTION WE PRESENT A CASE OF PERSISTENT WRIST PAIN IN A 43-YEAR-OLD WOMAN ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA ACTIVITIES. HER RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES DEMONSTRATED PARTIAL SCAPHOLUNATE (SL) LIGAMENT TEAR AND AN ASSOCIATED MASS LESION. SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REVEALED MOT INVOLVING THE SL LIGAMENT. LITERATURE REVIEW MOT LESIONS IN THE UPPER EXTREMITY ARE USUALLY LOCALIZED AROUND THE ELBOW, AND CASES IN THE HAND ARE RELATIVELY RARE. THERE ARE NO PRIOR REPORTS OF OCCURRENCES WITHIN THE WRIST JOINT OR IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE SL LIGAMENT. HOWEVER, BIOMECHANICAL STUDIES HAVE QUANTIFIED SIGNIFICANT MECHANICAL STRAINS ACROSS THE SL INTERVAL DURING VARIOUS YOGA POSES. THIS PATTERN OF MICROTRAUMA IS CAPABLE OF GENERATING MOT. CLINICAL RELEVANCE UPPER EXTREMITY WEIGHT-BEARING POSITIONS ARE COMMON IN YOGA AND SUBJECT THE WRIST, ESPECIALLY THE SL INTERVAL, TO HIGH MECHANICAL STRAINS. THIS PATTERN OF MICROTRAUMA SHOULD LEAD THE CLINICIAN TO SUSPECT MOT WHEN ENCOUNTERING A MASS IN THE WRIST, BUT MALIGNANCY AND INFECTION MUST BE RULED OUT.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
6 1536  18 KETAMINE, TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION, AND DEPRESSION SPECIFIC YOGA AND MINDFULNESS BASED COGNITIVE THERAPY IN MANAGEMENT OF TREATMENT RESISTANT DEPRESSION: REVIEW AND SOME DATA ON EFFICACY. DEPRESSION AFFECTS ABOUT 121 MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE AND PREVALENCE OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD) IN US ADULTS IS 6.4%. TREATMENT RESISTANT DEPRESSION (TRD) ACCOUNTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 12-20% OF ALL DEPRESSION PATIENTS AND COSTS $29-$48 BILLION ANNUALLY. KETAMINE AND REPETITIVE TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION (RTMS) HAVE USEFUL ROLES IN TRD, BUT THEIR UTILITY IN LONG TERM IS UNKNOWN. AS PER THE LATEST LITERATURE, THE INTERVENTIONS USING YOGA AND MEDITATION INCLUDING THE MINDFULNESS BASED COGNITIVE THERAPY (MBCT) HAVE BEEN USEFUL IN TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION AND RELAPSE PREVENTION. WE PRESENT A REVIEW OF RTMS, KETAMINE, AND MBCT AND ALSO REPORT EFFICACY OF A DEPRESSION SPECIFIC, INNOVATIVE, AND TRANSLATIONAL MODEL OF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS BASED COGNITIVE THERAPY (DEPS Y-MBCT), DEVELOPED BY THE FIRST AUTHOR. DEPS Y-MBCT AS AN ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT SUCCESSFULLY AMELIORATED TRD SYMPTOMS IN 27/32 PATIENTS IN AN OPEN LABEL PILOT TRIAL IN TRD PATIENTS. CONSIDERING THE LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING TREATMENT OPTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE OF KETAMINE AND RTMS WHEN USED AS THE SOLE MODALITY OF TREATMENT, WE SUGGEST A "TIERED APPROACH FOR TRD" BY COMBINING KETAMINE AND RTMS (ALONE OR ALONG WITH ANTIDEPRESSANTS) FOR RAPID REMISSION OF ACUTE DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AND TO USE DEPS Y-MBCT FOR MAINTAINING REMISSION AND PREVENTING RELAPSE.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
7 1501  17 INVERTED YOGA AND NEAR SYNCOPE: AN UNUSUAL DIAGNOSIS OF RIGHT VENTRICULAR MYXOMA. PRIMARY CARDIAC TUMORS ARE EXTREMELY RARE AND ARE DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE. ALTHOUGH USUALLY BENIGN IN NATURE, MYXOMAS REQUIRE SURGICAL RESECTION DUE TO THEIR INCREASED RISK OF EMBOLIC AND CARDIAC COMPLICATIONS, WITH THE TIMING OF RESECTION DEPENDENT ON THE PRESENTATION AND SIZE OF THE TUMOR. HOWEVER, IF DIAGNOSED EARLY, PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY BENIGN CARDIAC TUMORS HAVE EXCELLENT PROGNOSIS FOLLOWING SURGERY. THEREFORE, A HIGH INDEX OF SUSPICION AND A WIDE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN DETECTING RARE CONDITIONS THAT CAN AFFECT OTHERWISE HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS. WE PRESENT AN UNCOMMON CASE OF A RIGHT VENTRICULAR MYXOMA THAT WAS DISCOVERED WHEN THE PATIENT WAS PERFORMING INVERTED YOGA AND EXPERIENCED A NEAR SYNCOPAL EPISODE. PATIENT SUBSEQUENTLY UNDERWENT AN ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION AND WAS FOUND TO HAVE A RIGHT VENTRICULAR MYXOMA THAT WAS EXCISED. ALTHOUGH RECURRENCE IS RARE, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR PHYSICIANS TO REMAIN VIGILANT AND CONTINUE CAREFUL AND CONSISTENT FOLLOW-UP FOR PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF A CARDIAC MYXOMA.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
8  533  16 COMPARISON OF TWO TAGTEACH ERROR-CORRECTION PROCEDURES TO TEACH BEGINNER YOGA POSES TO ADULTS. TEACHING WITH ACOUSTICAL GUIDANCE INVOLVES AUDITORY FEEDBACK (E.G., A CLICK SOUND WHEN A DESIRED BEHAVIOR OCCURS) AS PART OF A MULTICOMPONENT INTERVENTION KNOWN AS TAGTEACH. TAGTEACH HAS BEEN FOUND TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE IN SPORT, DANCE, SURGICAL TECHNIQUE, AND WALKING. WE COMPARED THE EFFICACY AND EFFICIENCY OF THE STANDARD TAGTEACH ERROR-CORRECTION PROCEDURE AND A MODIFIED TAGTEACH ERROR-CORRECTION PROCEDURE TO TEACH 4 NOVICE ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS BEGINNER YOGA POSES. BOTH ERROR-CORRECTION PROCEDURES WERE EFFECTIVE FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS; HOWEVER, THE RELATIVE EFFICIENCY OF THESE ERROR-CORRECTION PROCEDURES WAS UNCLEAR. RESULTS ARE DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF LIMITATIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
9 2912  20 [RECENT MEDICAL RESEARCH ON YOGA AND STATES OF CONCENTRATION]. TRADITIONAL ORIENTAL THINKING ATTRACTS THE GROWING SCIENTIFIC INTEREST OF OCCIDENTAL PRACTITIONERS. DR. PIERRE ETEVENON, HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF NEURO-PSYCHO-PHARMACOLOGY AT THE FRENCH INSTITUTE FOR HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESEARCH (INSERM), HELD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS AND SCIENTIFIC EXCHANGES WITH THE AUTHOR, AND KINDLY PROVIDED COPIES OF SOME OF HIS WORKS. THEY ARE AT THE BASIS OF THE PRESENT PAPER. M. A. DESCAMPS (PARIS) FOUND THAT ASANAS--YOGA POSTURES-- ARE GENERATORS OF DYNAMIC ACTION WHEN THERE IS AN EXTENSION OF THE SPINAL COLUMN, WHILST THEY LEAD TO QUIET STATES WHEN THERE IS A FLEXION OF IT. CLAEYS AND GONES (BELGIUM) PROVED THAT OVERALL GLOBAL RELAXATION, AS WELL AS DIFFERENTIAL RELAXATION WERE FAR MORE EFFECTIVE AND DEEP WHEN OBTAINED BY YOGIS THAN THOSE ATTEMPTED BY UNIVERSITY STUDENTS MAJORING IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION. LONSDORFER AND NUSSBAUM (FRANCE) STUDIED SEVERAL PARAMETERS CONCERNING HATHA-YOGA AND CONCLUDED THAT IT PROVIDES A REGULAR FUNCTIONING OF THE MAIN BODILY FUNCTIONS FOSTERING THUS A PSYCHO-PHYSICAL BALANCE. WALLACE AND BENSON (U.S.A.) PROVED THAT TRANSCENDENTAL MEDITATION INCREASES AEROBIC METABOLISM, COUNTERACTING ANAEROBIC METABOLISM WHICH IS RELATED TO MENTAL DISTRESS. ETEVENON (PARIS) INVESTIGATED NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF YOGA IN CONNECTION TO ANCIENT INDIAN CONCEPTS (UPANISHADS) ON SLEEPING, MEDITATION AND DEGREE OF CONSCIOUSNESS. DR. ETEVENON HAS STUDIED THE PHYLOGENETIC EVOLUTION OF WAKING-SLEEPING CYCLES, FOCUSING ON PHYLOGENETIC AND ONTONGENETIC APPEARANCES OF REM CYCLES (ACTIVATED SLEEP). A CORRELATION HAS BEEN MADE WITH EEG STUDIES DURING STATES OF CONCENTRATION (YOGA, TRANSCENDENTAL MEDITATION, ZEN). THESE STATES HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE SPECIFIC BRAIN ACTIVITIES, AND DIFFERENT FROM DEEP SLEEP, IN SPITE OF CERTAIN SIMILARITIES IN THE EEG. SEVERAL HYPOTHESIS ARE SET FORTH TO EXPLAIN BRAIN ACTIVITIES UNDERLYING SITES OF CONCENTRATION. THE POSSIBILITIES OF DEVELOPING A CONSCIOUS MASTERING OF DREAMS ARE ALSO UNDER RESEARCH, AND SPECIAL ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE WORKS OF SAINT DENYS (1867), AND HINDU TRADITION. THIS PAPER DISCUSSES ALSO THE PSYCHOLOGICAL, THERAPEUTIC AND ANTHROPOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS OF RECENT DISCOVERIES IN THE FIELD.	1975	

10 1754  12 PLACE OF NUTRITION IN YOGA. NUTRITION PLAYS A VERY VITAL ROLE IN OUR LIFE. YOGA AND AYURVEDA HAD LAID DOWN THE FOUNDATIONS OF DIETETICS. THE VALUABLE GUIDELINES REGARDING VARIOUS FOOD ARTICLES AND DIET FOR YOGA SADHAKA, TO ACHIEVE MAXIMUM BENEFITS, ARE GIVEN IN TRADITIONAL YOGA TEXTS LIKE HATHA PRADIPIKA AND GHERANDA SAMHITHA.

12  407  13 BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF PIEZOELECTRICITY IN RELATION TO ACUPUNCTURE, HATHA YOGA, OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE AND ACTION OF AIR IONS. PIEZOELECTRIC PROPERTIES OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES SUCH AS PROTEINS, NUCLEIC ACIDS AND MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDES ARE REVIEWED IN THIS PAPER. IT IS INDICATED THAT THE STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS OF THE HUMAN BODY COMPOSED OF THESE PIEZOELECTRIC SUBSTANCES ARE CAPABLE OF TRANSDUCING A MECHANICAL ENERGY INTO AN ELECTRIC CURRENT. SUCH A TRANSDUCTION MAY BE BROUGHT ABOUT BY MOVEMENTS OF AN ACUPUNCTURE NEEDLE, OSTEOPATHIC MANIPULATIONS; HATHA YOGA POSTURES OR ACTION OF NEGATIVELY CHARGED AIR IRONS. IT IS POSTULATED THAT ELECTRIC CURRENT INDUCED BY STIMULATION OF THE SPECIFIC SITES ON THE SURFACE OF HUMAN BODY FLOWS TOWARDS THE INTERNAL ORGANS ALONG THE SEMICONDUCTIVE CHANNELS OF BIOLOGIC MACROMOLECULES. ELECTRIC CURRENT INDUCED EITHER BY THE PIEZOELECTRIC TRANSDUCTION OR DIRECTLY APPLIED FROM AN EXTERNAL SOURCE MAY IN TURN STIMULATE INDIVIDUAL CELLS IN THE TARGET ORGAN. INVOLVEMENT OF ELECTRICAL PHENOMENA IN REGULATORY MECHANISMS ON CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR LEVELS IS DISCUSSED.	1977	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
13 1570  23 MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE CALCULUS CHOLECYSTITIS WITH INTEGRATED AYURVEDA AND YOGA INTERVENTION: A CASE REPORT. ACUTE CALCULUS CHOLECYSTITIS (ACC) IS A FREQUENTLY REPORTED MEDICAL CONDITION IN GENERAL PRACTICE. APPROXIMATELY 20% OF PATIENTS WITH GALLBLADDER STONES EXPERIENCE ACC IN THEIR LIFETIME. AYURVEDA AND YOGA ARE ANCIENT TRADITIONAL SYSTEMS OF MEDICINE USED FOR TREATMENT OF DISEASES AND IMPROVING AND MAINTAINING HEALTH. THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASED USE OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SEVERAL HEALTH CONDITIONS IN INDIA AND WORLDWIDE. THE PRESENT CASE STUDY IS OF 34 YEARS FEMALE PATIENT WHO HAD ACC. POST DIAGNOSIS OF ACC PATIENT WAS ADVISED TO UNDERGO CHOLECYSTECTOMY; HOWEVER, SHE APPROACHED ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES WITH C/O VOMITING, NAUSEA, ABDOMINAL PAIN, JAUNDICE, ITCHING, AND ABDOMINAL BLOATING WITH DERANGED LIVER FUNCTIONS. AYURVEDA AND YOGA INTERVENTION PROTOCOL WAS DESIGNED. AYURVEDA TREATMENT CONSISTED OF MILD PURGATION (MRUDUVIRECHANA) WITH TRIVRITTALEHYAM FOR CONSECUTIVE SEVEN DAYS, FOLLOWED BY ORAL ADMINISTRATION OF TAB LIV 52, BHUNIMBADI KADHA TWICE DAILY, AND AMALAKI RASAYANA IN THE MORNING FOR 45 DAYS. PATIENTS RECEIVED 8 TELEYOGA SESSIONS OVER A PERIOD OF 45 DAYS. A THERAPEUTIC DIET WAS ADVISED DURING TREATMENT PERIOD. AFTER TWO MONTHS PATIENT REPORTED COMPLETE RECOVERY IN SYMPTOMS, AND ALL LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS REACHED TO NORMAL RANGE. THIS CASE STUDY SUGGESTS THE POSITIVE ROLE OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA INTERVENTION IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ACC. THIS CASE REPORT WARRANTS FUTURE CLINICAL STUDIES ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE IN ACC.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
14 1952  16 SEASONAL AFFECTIVE DISORDER AND THE YOGA PARADIGM: A RECONSIDERATION OF THE ROLE OF THE PINEAL GLAND. SEASONAL AFFECTIVE DISORDER IS A PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER WHOSE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND CLINICAL PRESENTATION ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. BY APPLYING THE ANCIENT PARADIGM OF YOGA PSYCHOLOGY TO THIS SUBJECT, NEW UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE SYNDROME EMERGE REGARDING THE POSSIBLE ROLE OF THE PINEAL GLAND, THE CLINICAL PRESENTATION OF THE SYNDROME, AND THE POSSIBLE MECHANISM OF ACTION OF PHOTOTHERAPY. THE ENERGY DEPLETION MODEL PRESENTED HERE TIES TOGETHER SUCH DIVERSE ELEMENTS AS: DOSE-RESPONSE ASPECTS OF PHOTOTHERAPY, ANERGIA AS A PRIMARY SYMPTOM OF SAD, 'SPRING FEVER', MYOFASCIAL PAIN DISORDER, THE ANTI-GONADOTROPHIC EFFECT OF MELATONIN, AND PINEAL SUPERSENSITIVITY IN BIPOLAR PATIENTS. CLINICAL PREDICTIONS ARE MADE, AND SIMPLE RESEARCH PROTOCOLS ARE SUGGESTED WHICH CAN DIRECTLY TEST THE HYPOTHESES GENERATED BY THIS PARADIGM.	1990

16 2498  15 YOGA AS SANCTUARY: A VALUABLE MIND-BODY INTERVENTION FOR THE LESBIAN COMMUNITY. POETIC AUTOETHNOGRAPHY PROVIDES A RESEARCH METHODOLOGY TO EXPLORE YOGA AS A MIND-BODY INTERVENTION THAT CREATES SANCTUARY. USING THIS QUALITATIVE METHOD AND RETRIEVING DATA FROM MY PERSONAL JOURNALS, DAILY WORKOUT JOURNALS, EXPERIENCES AS A LESBIAN-IDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT IN YOGA CLASSES, AND YOGA INSTRUCTOR, I TURN THE RESEARCH LENS ON MYSELF IN ORDER TO EXAMINE MY SOCIOLOGICAL LIFE STORY. AT A CRITICAL TIME IN MY LIFE WHEN I WAS STRUGGLING WITH THE FRAGMENTATION, ANXIETY, AND DESPAIR RESULTING FROM DEALING WITH HOMOPHOBIA IN A HETERONORMATIVE WORLD, YOGA PROVIDED SANCTUARY FOR ME. MY YOGA PRACTICE INCREASED MY SELF-EFFICACY, PROVIDING TRANSFERABLE TECHNIQUES FOR FINDING REFUGE WITHIN MYSELF, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE ADVERSITY I WAS FACING IN MY LIFE. PLACES OF SANCTUARY ARE CRITICAL FOR MEMBERS OF MINORITY GROUPS WHO OFTEN FACE MARGINALIZATION AND OPPRESSION, WHICH COMPROMISE THEIR WELL-BEING.	2017

18  486  13 CLINICAL HYPNOSIS AND PATANJALI YOGA SUTRAS. THE TRANCE STATES IN YOGA AND HYPNOSIS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH SIMILAR PHENOMENA LIKE RELAXATION, DISINCLINATION TO TALK, UNREALITY, MISREPRESENTATION, ALTERATIONS IN PERCEPTION, INCREASED CONCENTRATION, SUSPENSION OF NORMAL REALITY TESTING, AND THE TEMPORARY NATURE OF THE PHENOMENA. WHILE SOME RESEARCHERS CONSIDER YOGA TO BE A FORM OF HYPNOSIS, OTHERS NOTE THAT THERE ARE MANY SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE TRANCE IN YOGA AND THE HYPNOTIC TRANCE. THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO FIND SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE TRANCE STATES OF HYPNOSIS AND PATANJALI'S YOGA SUTRAS. THE TRANCE STATES WERE COMPARED WITH THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE PHENOMENA OF TRANCE, AND THE THERAPEUTIC TECHNIQUES AND BENEFITS OF BOTH. AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONCEPT OF TRANCE IN PATANJALI'S YOGA SUTRAS WAS GAINED THROUGH A THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF THE BOOK FOUR CHAPTERS ON FREEDOM BY SWAMI SATYANANDA SARASWATI. THIS LED TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONCEPT OF TRANCE IN THE YOGA SUTRAS. THE OBTAINED CONCEPTS WERE COMPARED TO THE CONCEPTS OF TRANCE IN HYPNOSIS (OBTAINED THROUGH THE LITERATURE ON HYPNOSIS) TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER OR NOT THERE EXIST SIMILARITIES. THE FINDINGS OF THE STUDY SHOW THAT THERE ARE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE TRANCE IN HYPNOSIS AND THE TRANCE IN PATANJALI'S YOGA SUTRAS IN THE INDUCTION AND DEEPENING OF THE TRANCE STATES IN HYPNOSIS AND THAT OF SAMADHI, THE PHENOMENA PRESENT IN HYPNOSIS AND THE KINDS OF SIDDHIS THAT ARE OBTAINED THROUGH SAMADHI, AND THE THERAPEUTIC TECHNIQUES AND THE THERAPEUTIC PROCESS IN PATANJALI'S YOGA SUTRA AND HYPNOSIS.	2013

PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS IDENTIFIED FIELDS OF SKIN RECRUITED DURING SINGLE JOINT MOTION, CALLED CUTANEOUS FUNCTIONAL UNITS (CFU), INDICATING THAT IMPAIRMENTS MAY BE SEEN DISTAL TO THE INJURED TISSUE. THIS CASE REPORT CONNECTS THE PRINCIPLES OF CFU AND YOGA-INSPIRED THERAPY MODALITIES IN IMPROVING CLINICAL OUTCOMES FOR A BURN SURVIVOR. THE PATIENT IS A 38-YEAR-OLD MALE WHO SUSTAINED DEEP PARTIAL-THICKNESS ELECTRICAL BURNS TO HIS NECK, CHEST, AND BILATERAL UPPER EXTREMITIES, PRESENTING WITH SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED RANGE OF MOTION. THE PATIENT ATTENDED PHYSICAL THERAPY 4 DAYS A WEEK, WHERE HE PERFORMED A SPECIFIC YOGA ASANA PROGRAM DURING EACH SESSION. OUTCOMES INCLUDING STANDARD RANGE OF MOTION MEASURES, THE VANCOUVER SCAR SCALE (VSS), AND THE NECK DISABILITY INDEX (NDI), WHICH WERE RECORDED EVERY 10 SESSIONS. CFUS OF CERVICAL EXTENSION AND SHOULDER FLEXION WERE ANALYZED VIA PHOTOGRAPHS COMPARING CUTANEOUS POSITION DURING SPECIFIED YOGA POSES AND RESTING ANATOMICAL POSITION IN STANDING. OVER 30 VISITS, CERVICAL AND SHOULDER RANGE OF MOTION INCREASED, ALTHOUGH THE VSS AND NDI DID NOT SHOW SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. YOGA POSES SHOWED OVERALL CUTANEOUS RECRUITMENT DISTAL TO THE TARGETED JOINTS, AND BURNED SKIN WAS RECRUITED SIMILARLY TO NONBURNED SKIN IN POSITIONS OF STRETCH. INCORPORATING MULTIJOINT APPROACHES FOR STRETCHING, LIKE YOGA, APPEARS TO CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVED CLINICAL RANGE-OF-MOTION OUTCOMES WHEN PAIRED WITH TRADITIONAL BURN-REHABILITATION INTERVENTIONS. YOGA POSES INVOLVING MULTIPLE JOINTS ALIGN WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF CFUS, WARRANTING CONTINUED INVESTIGATION.	2022

1  877 106 EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY ON SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY IN CANCER PATIENTS. BACKGROUND: MANY CANCER PATIENTS SUFFER FROM SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND FATIGUE. SUPPORTIVE TREATMENTS ARE INCREASINGLY USED TO ALLEVIATE DISTRESS IN CANCER. IN THIS STUDY, THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON THESE SYMPTOMS ARE EXAMINED. METHODS: WE PERFORMED A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY ON CANCER PATIENTS WITH MIXED DIAGNOSES COMPARING YOGA THERAPY WITH A WAITING LIST CONTROL GROUP. WE MEASURED ANXIETY SYMPTOMS WITH THE GENERAL ANXIETY DISORDER (GAD-7) SCALE, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS WITH THE PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE-2 (PHQ-2), AND FATIGUE WITH THE EUROPEAN ORGANISATION FOR RESEARCH AND TREATMENT OF CANCER FATIGUE SCALE (EORTC QLQ-FA13). YOGA THERAPY WAS CARRIED OUT IN WEEKLY SESSIONS OF 60 MIN EACH FOR 8 WEEKS. THE PROGRAM PROVIDED RESTRAINED BODY AND BREATHING EXERCISES AS WELL AS MEDITATION. THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT RECEIVE ANY YOGA THERAPY WHILE ON THE WAITING LIST. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 70 SUBJECTS PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY. ANXIETY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BY THE YOGA THERAPY IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP (P = 0.005). HOWEVER, YOGA THERAPY DID NOT SHOW ANY SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON DEPRESSION (P = 0.21) AND FATIGUE (P = 0.11) COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: YOGA THERAPY MAY BE USED TO ALLEVIATE ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IN CANCER PATIENTS AND SHOULD BE THE SUBJECT OF FURTHER RESEARCH.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
2 1519  33 IS YOGA EFFECTIVE FOR PAIN? A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AS A TREATMENT OPTION FOR ANY TYPE OF PAIN. METHOD: SEVEN DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FROM THEIR INCEPTION TO FEBRUARY 2011. RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS WERE CONSIDERED IF THEY INVESTIGATED YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH ANY TYPE OF PAIN AND IF THEY ASSESSED PAIN AS A PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE. THE 5-POINT JADAD SCALE WAS USED TO ASSESS METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF STUDIES. THE SELECTION OF STUDIES, DATA EXTRACTION AND QUALITY ASSESSMENT WERE PERFORMED INDEPENDENTLY BY TWO REVIEWERS. RESULTS: TEN RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS (RCTS) MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. THEIR METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY RANGED BETWEEN 1 AND 4 ON THE JADAD SCALE. NINE RCTS SUGGESTED THAT YOGA LEADS TO A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER REDUCTION IN PAIN THAN VARIOUS CONTROL INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS STANDARD CARE, SELF CARE, THERAPEUTIC EXERCISES, RELAXING YOGA, TOUCH AND MANIPULATION, OR NO INTERVENTION. ONE RCT FAILED TO PROVIDE BETWEEN GROUP DIFFERENCES IN PAIN SCORES. CONCLUSIONS: IT IS CONCLUDED THAT YOGA HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR ALLEVIATING PAIN. HOWEVER, DEFINITIVE JUDGMENTS ARE NOT POSSIBLE.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
3 2172  34 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON DEPRESSION AND MOTOR FUNCTION IN PATIENTS WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE: A REVIEW OF CONTROLLED STUDIES. BACKGROUND: PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD) IS A NEURODEGENERATIVE/NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDER CHARACTERIZED BY BOTH MOTOR AND NON-MOTOR SYMPTOMOLOGY. THE REPORTED PREVALENCE OF DEPRESSION IN PATIENTS WITH PD IS DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN DUE TO OVERLAPPING SOMATIC SYMPTOMS AND FAILURE TO SELF-REPORT SYMPTOMS. ALTHOUGH ANTIDEPRESSANTS REMAIN A FIRST-LINE TREATMENT, THEY CAN HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS. RECENTLY, LITERATURE HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT DUE TO ITS ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PROPERTIES, YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE NONPHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY FOR DEPRESSION. METHODS: A SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) PUBLISHED FROM JANUARY 2000 TO JANUARY 2019 THAT ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON DEPRESSION AND MOTOR FUNCTIONING IN PD. RESULTS: THREE STUDIES MET THE CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION. IN ONE RCT, BIWEEKLY YOGA RESULTED IN A DECREASE IN DEPRESSION SCORE (P = .056). IN ANOTHER RCT, WEEKLY YOGA RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN DEPRESSION AND DEMONSTRATED THAT ITS THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS ARE LONG-LASTING. FINALLY, IN A THIRD RCT, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND BETWEEN CONTROL AND EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS IN DEPRESSION AFTER BIWEEKLY YOGA. HOWEVER, YOGA WAS FOUND TO BE PROTECTIVE AGAINST WORSENING OF DEPRESSION. CONCLUSIONS: OUR REVIEW SUGGESTS THAT THE PRACTICE OF YOGA MAY BE A USEFUL NONPHARMACOLOGIC ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION IN PATIENTS WITH PD. HOWEVER, MORE CONTROLLED RCTS ARE NEEDED TO VALIDATE OUR CONCLUSIONS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
4 1056  42 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY OF WOMEN. UNLABELLED: YOGA HAS OFTEN BEEN PERCEIVED AS A METHOD OF STRESS MANAGEMENT TOOL THAT CAN ASSIST IN ALLEVIATING DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY DISORDERS. THIS STUDY SOUGHT TO EVALUATE THE INFLUENCE OF YOGA IN RELIEVING SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY IN WOMEN WHO WERE REFERRED TO A YOGA CLINIC. METHODS: THE STUDY INVOLVED A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF WOMEN WHO WERE REFERRED TO A YOGA CLINIC FROM JULY 2006 TO JULY 2007. ALL NEW CASES WERE EVALUATED ON ADMISSION USING A PERSONAL INFORMATION QUESTIONNAIRE WELL AS BECK AND SPIELBERGER TESTS. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED INTO AN EXPERIMENTAL AND A CONTROL GROUP. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (N=34) PARTICIPATED IN TWICE WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES OF 90 MIN DURATION FOR TWO MONTHS. THE CONTROL GROUP (N=31) WAS ASSIGNED TO A WAITING LIST AND DID NOT RECEIVE YOGA. BOTH GROUPS WERE EVALUATED AGAIN AFTER THE TWO-MONTH STUDY PERIOD. RESULTS: THE AVERAGE PREVALENCE OF DEPRESSION IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PRE AND POST YOGA INTERVENTION WAS 12.82+/-7.9 AND 10.79+/-6.04 RESPECTIVELY, A STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT DECREASE (P=0.13). HOWEVER, WHEN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP, WOMEN WHO PARTICIPATED IN YOGA CLASSES SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN STATE ANXIETY (P=0.03) AND TRAIT ANXIETY (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: PARTICIPATION IN A TWO-MONTH YOGA CLASS CAN LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PERCEIVED LEVELS OF ANXIETY IN WOMEN WHO SUFFER FROM ANXIETY DISORDERS. THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT YOGA CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY OR AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD FOR MEDICAL THERAPY IN THE TREATMENT OF ANXIETY DISORDERS.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
5 1040  29 EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTION DURING PREGNANCY: A REVIEW FOR CURRENT STATUS. OBJECTIVES: THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO REVIEW ALL RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS (RCTS) THAT HAVE LOOKED AT THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PREGNANCY, AND TO PRESENT THEIR EVIDENCE ON THE SPECIFIC WAYS IN WHICH PREGNANT WOMEN, AND THEIR INFANTS CAN BENEFIT FROM YOGA INTERVENTION. THE PURPOSE IS ALSO TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOGA INTERVENTION DURING PREGNANCY IS MORE BENEFICIAL THAN OTHER PHYSICAL EXERCISES. METHODS: FOUR DATABASES WERE SEARCHED USING THE TERMS "YOGA AND (PREGNANCY OR PREGNANT OR PRENATAL OR POSTNATAL OR POSTPARTUM)." DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FROM JANUARY 2004 TO FEBRUARY 2014. RESULTS: TEN RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE EVALUATED. THE FINDINGS CONSISTENTLY INDICATE THAT YOGA INTERVENTION PRESENTED WITH LOWER INCIDENCES OF PRENATAL DISORDERS (P </= 0.05), AND SMALL GESTATIONAL AGE (P < 0.05), LOWER LEVELS OF PAIN AND STRESS (P < 0.05), AND HIGHER SCORE OF RELATIONSHIP (P < 0.05). IN ADDITION, YOGA CAN BE SAFELY USED FOR PREGNANT WOMEN WHO ARE DEPRESSED, AT HIGH-RISK, OR EXPERIENCE LUMBOPELVIC PAIN. MOREOVER, YOGA IS A MORE EFFECTIVE EXERCISE THAN WALKING OR STANDARD PRENATAL EXERCISES. CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA IS A SAFE AND MORE EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION DURING PREGNANCY. HOWEVER, FURTHER RCTS ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE FIRMER EVIDENCE REGARDING THE UTILITY AND VALIDITY OF YOGA INTERVENTION.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
6 2387  33 YOGA AMELIORATES PERFORMANCE ANXIETY AND MOOD DISTURBANCE IN YOUNG PROFESSIONAL MUSICIANS. YOGA AND MEDITATION CAN ALLEVIATE STRESS, ANXIETY, MOOD DISTURBANCE, AND MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS, AND CAN ENHANCE COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE. PROFESSIONAL MUSICIANS EXPERIENCE HIGH LEVELS OF STRESS, PERFORMANCE ANXIETY, AND DEBILITATING PERFORMANCE-RELATED MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS (PRMDS). THE GOAL OF THIS CONTROLLED STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE BENEFITS OF YOGA AND MEDITATION FOR MUSICIANS. YOUNG ADULT PROFESSIONAL MUSICIANS WHO VOLUNTEERED TO PARTICIPATE IN A 2-MONTH PROGRAM OF YOGA AND MEDITATION WERE RANDOMIZED TO A YOGA LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 15) OR TO A GROUP PRACTICING YOGA AND MEDITATION ONLY (N = 15). ADDITIONAL MUSICIANS WERE RECRUITED TO A NO-PRACTICE CONTROL GROUP (N = 15). BOTH YOGA GROUPS ATTENDED THREE KRIPALU YOGA OR MEDITATION CLASSES EACH WEEK. THE YOGA LIFESTYLE GROUP ALSO EXPERIENCED WEEKLY GROUP PRACTICE AND DISCUSSION SESSIONS AS PART OF THEIR MORE IMMERSIVE TREATMENT. ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED BASELINE AND END-PROGRAM SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES THAT EVALUATED MUSIC PERFORMANCE ANXIETY, MOOD, PRMDS, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND SLEEP QUALITY; MANY PARTICIPANTS LATER COMPLETED A 1-YEAR FOLLOWUP ASSESSMENT USING THE SAME QUESTIONNAIRES. BOTH YOGA GROUPS SHOWED A TREND TOWARDS LESS MUSIC PERFORMANCE ANXIETY AND SIGNIFICANTLY LESS GENERAL ANXIETY/TENSION, DEPRESSION, AND ANGER AT END-PROGRAM RELATIVE TO CONTROLS, BUT SHOWED NO CHANGES IN PRMDS, STRESS, OR SLEEP. SIMILAR RESULTS IN THE TWO YOGA GROUPS, DESPITE PSYCHOSOCIAL DIFFERENCES IN THEIR INTERVENTIONS, SUGGEST THAT THE YOGA AND MEDITATION TECHNIQUES THEMSELVES MAY HAVE MEDIATED THE IMPROVEMENTS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA AND MEDITATION TECHNIQUES CAN REDUCE PERFORMANCE ANXIETY AND MOOD DISTURBANCE IN YOUNG PROFESSIONAL MUSICIANS.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
7 2899  43 [EFFECTS OF PRENATAL YOGA: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS]. OBJECTIVES: WHILE SEVERAL STUDIES ON THE PREVENTIVE AND THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF PRENATAL YOGA (MATERNITY YOGA) HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN NO SYSTEMATIC REVIEW ON THE EFFECTS OF PRENATAL YOGA BASED ON RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCT). THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY, THEREFORE, WAS TO SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEW THE LITERATURE TO CLARIFY THE EFFECTS OF PRENATAL YOGA IN RCT FOCUSING ON THE CONTENTS OF THE INTERVENTION, THE INTERVENTION MEANS, AND THE FREQUENCY OF PRACTICE. METHODS: THE LITERATURE SEARCH WAS PERFORMED USING THE ELECTRONIC DATABASE, PUBMED. THE INCLUSION CRITERIA WERE RCT, PREGNANT WOMEN, AND YOGA INTERVENTION. RESULTS: IN TOTAL, 54 CITATIONS WERE FOUND; OF THESE, EIGHT STUDIES (10 REPORTS) WERE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS. IN FOUR STUDIES ON HEALTHY PREGNANT WOMEN, SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PAIN AND PLEASURE AT DELIVERY, DURATION OF DELIVERY, PERCEIVED STRESS LEVELS DURING PREGNANCY, ANXIETY LEVELS, DEPRESSION, PREGNANCY-RELATED EXPERIENCES, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS WERE COMPARED TO THOSE IN THE CONTROL GROUP. IN TWO STUDIES ON DEPRESSED PREGNANT WOMEN, ONE REPORTED THAT DEPRESSION, ANXIETY LEVELS, ANGER LEVELS, LEG PAIN, AND BACK PAIN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED WITH YOGA, WHILE THE OTHER FOUND NO DIFFERENCES FROM THE CONTROL GROUP. IN ONE STUDY OF HIGH-RISK PREGNANT WOMEN WITH MORBIDITY FACTORS SUCH AS OBESITY OR ADVANCED AGE, YOGA RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER CASES OF PREGNANCY-INDUCED HYPERTENSION, GESTATIONAL DIABETES, AND INTRAUTERINE GROWTH RESTRICTION, AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN PERCEIVED STRESS LEVELS. IN ONE STUDY ON PREGNANT WOMEN WITH PELVIC PAIN, THE MEDIAN PAIN SCORE WAS LOWER IN THE YOGA GROUP. REGARDING THE CONTENTS OF THE INTERVENTION, WHILE THE TWO STUDIES FOR DEPRESSED PREGNANT WOMEN ONLY INCLUDED PHYSICAL POSTURES, THE REMAINING SIX STUDIES ALSO INCLUDED BREATHING TECHNIQUE AND MEDITATION. INTERVENTIONS WERE PERFORMED USING LECTURES BY INSTRUCTORS ALONE OR TOGETHER WITH SELF-TEACHING. THE FREQUENCY OF THE INTERVENTION VARIED WITHIN EACH STUDY. CONCLUSION: THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT PRENATAL YOGA MAY HELP REDUCE PELVIC PAIN. IT MAY ALSO IMPROVE MENTAL CONDITION (STRESS, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, ETC.), PHYSICAL CONDITION (PAIN AND PLEASURE AT THE DELIVERY, ETC.), AND PERINATAL OUTCOMES (OBSTETRICAL COMPLICATIONS, DELIVERY TIME, ETC.). HOWEVER, FURTHER STUDIES ARE NEEDED. THE CONTENTS OF THE INTERVENTION, THE INTERVENTION MEANS, AND THE FREQUENCY VARIED WITH EACH STUDY. THUS, IT IS NECESSARY TO FURTHER EXAMINE THE CONTENT OF EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS, INTERVENTION MEANS, AND FREQUENCY THAT SUIT PARTICIPANT'S CHARACTERISTICS AND EACH OUTCOME. FURTHER RESEARCH IN THIS FIELD, PARTICULARLY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS, IS MERITED.	2015	

8 2170  30 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON ANXIETY AND STRESS. STRESS AND ANXIETY HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED AS CONTRIBUTORS TO MANY CHRONIC DISEASES AND TO DECREASED QUALITY OF LIFE, EVEN WITH PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT. EFFORTS ARE UNDERWAY TO FIND NON-PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPIES TO RELIEVE STRESS AND ANXIETY, AND YOGA IS ONE OPTION FOR WHICH RESULTS ARE PROMISING. THE FOCUS OF THIS REVIEW IS ON THE RESULTS OF HUMAN TRIALS ASSESSING THE ROLE OF YOGA IN IMPROVING THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF STRESS AND ANXIETY. OF 35 TRIALS ADDRESSING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON ANXIETY AND STRESS, 25 NOTED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN STRESS AND/OR ANXIETY SYMPTOMS WHEN A YOGA REGIMEN WAS IMPLEMENTED; HOWEVER, MANY OF THE STUDIES WERE ALSO HINDERED BY LIMITATIONS, SUCH AS SMALL STUDY POPULATIONS, LACK OF RANDOMIZATION, AND LACK OF A CONTROL GROUP. FOURTEEN OF THE 35 STUDIES REPORTED BIOCHEMICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL MARKERS OF STRESS AND ANXIETY, BUT YIELDED INCONSISTENT SUPPORT OF YOGA FOR RELIEF OF STRESS AND ANXIETY. EVALUATION OF THE CURRENT PRIMARY LITERATURE IS SUGGESTIVE OF BENEFITS OF YOGA IN RELIEVING STRESS AND ANXIETY, BUT FURTHER INVESTIGATION INTO THIS RELATIONSHIP USING LARGE, WELL-DEFINED POPULATIONS, ADEQUATE CONTROLS, RANDOMIZATION AND LONG DURATION SHOULD BE EXPLORED BEFORE RECOMMENDING YOGA AS A TREATMENT OPTION.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
9 2326  33 TREATMENT OF PREGNANCY-RELATED LUMBAR AND PELVIC GIRDLE PAIN BY THE YOGA METHOD: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. OBJECTIVE: PREGNANCY-RELATED LUMBOPELVIC PAIN IS A MAJOR PROBLEM FOR THE MAJORITY OF PREGNANT WOMEN. COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE HAS BEEN USED TO ALLEVIATE PAIN, AND YOGA IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE METHODS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HATHA YOGA IN THE REDUCTION OF LUMBOPELVIC PAIN IN PREGNANCY. METHODS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH 60 PREGNANT WOMEN (AGE RANGE, 14-40 YEARS) WHO REPORTED LUMBOPELVIC PAIN AT 12 TO 32 WEEKS OF GESTATION WAS CONDUCTED FROM JUNE 2009 TO JUNE 2011. PREGNANT WOMEN WHO HAD TWIN PREGNANCIES, HAD MEDICAL RESTRICTIONS FOR EXERCISE, USED ANALGESICS, AND PARTICIPATED IN PHYSICAL THERAPY WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE STUDY. PREGNANT WOMEN WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: THE YOGA GROUP, PRACTICING EXERCISES GUIDED BY THIS METHOD, AND THE POSTURAL ORIENTATION GROUP, PERFORMING STANDARDIZED POSTURE ORIENTATION ACCORDING TO INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED IN A PAMPHLET. TREATMENT IN EACH GROUP LASTED 10 WEEKS. A VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS) WAS USED TO MEASURE PAIN INTENSITY. LUMBAR PAIN AND POSTERIOR PELVIC PAIN PROVOCATION TESTS WERE USED TO CONFIRM THE PRESENCE OF PAIN. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS INCLUDED THE MANN-WHITNEY TEST, THE MCNEMAR TEST, A PAIRED WILCOXON TEST, AND ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE. RESULTS: THE MEDIAN PAIN SCORE WAS LOWER IN THE YOGA GROUP (P<.0058) THAN THE POSTURAL ORIENTATION GROUP. LUMBAR PAIN PROVOCATION TESTS SHOWED A DECREASED RESPONSE IN RELATION TO POSTERIOR PELVIC PAIN PROVOCATION TESTS AND A GRADUAL REDUCTION IN PAIN INTENSITY DURING 10 YOGA SESSIONS (P<.024). CONCLUSIONS: THE YOGA METHOD WAS MORE EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING LUMBOPELVIC PAIN INTENSITY COMPARED WITH POSTURAL ORIENTATION.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
10 1199  31 EXERCISE AND YOGA DURING PREGNANCY AND THEIR IMPACT ON DEPRESSION: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW. IT IS WELL ESTABLISHED THAT EXERCISE CAN IMPROVE DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IN THE GENERAL POPULATION; HOWEVER, IT IS NOT CLEAR IF THESE BENEFITS ARE ALSO SEEN IN PREGNANCY. THIS REVIEW AIMED TO SYNTHESIZE THE EVIDENCE THAT EXAMINES WHETHER EXERCISE DURING PREGNANCY IMPACTS DEPRESSIVE AND ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS (E.G. ANXIETY) DURING THE PERINATAL PERIOD. THE REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH PRISMA GUIDELINES AND REPORTING CRITERIA; LITERATURE WAS SEARCHED USING PUBMED, SCOPUS AND WEB OF SCIENCE DATABASE ENGINES. CLINICAL TRIALS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH EVALUATING THE EFFECTS OF A DEFINED EXERCISE PROTOCOL DURING PREGNANCY ON DEPRESSIVE AND/OR ANXIETY SYMPTOMS DURING THE PERINATAL PERIOD WERE INCLUDED. STUDIES WITHOUT A CONTROL GROUP WERE EXCLUDED. RISK OF BIAS WAS CONDUCTED BY COCHRANE ASSESSMENT TO APPRAISE THE QUALITY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES. TWENTY-SEVEN ARTICLES, BETWEEN 1994 AND 2019, WERE INCLUDED. OF THESE, ONLY 5 SPECIFICALLY RECRUITED WOMEN WITH DEPRESSION (N = 334), WHICH ALL ASSESSED A YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION; 4 OF THESE STUDIES SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN DEPRESSIVE AND/OR ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP COMPARED TO BASELINE; HOWEVER, 2 OF THESE STUDIES ALSO SHOWED AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE CONTROL GROUP. THE REMAINING 22 STUDIES USED VARIOUS EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS IN PREGNANT WOMEN (N = 4808) WITH 20 STUDIES REPORTING THAT EXERCISE DURING PREGNANCY HAS THE ABILITY TO IMPROVE DEPRESSIVE AND/OR ANXIETY MEASURES IN THE PERINATAL PERIOD COMPARED TO EITHER BASELINE OR CONTROL. THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT EXERCISE OF VARIOUS TYPES IN PREGNANCY CAN REDUCE DEPRESSIVE AND/OR ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IN THE PERINATAL PERIOD IN OTHERWISE HEALTHY WOMEN. SPECIFICALLY IN WOMEN WITH ANTENATAL DEPRESSION, THE INCORPORATION OF YOGA IN PREGNANCY CAN IMPROVE DEPRESSIVE/ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IN THE PERINATAL PERIOD; HOWEVER, THIS IS BASED ON A SMALL NUMBER OF STUDIES, AND IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER THIS IS SUPERIOR TO NON-EXERCISE CONTROLS. FURTHER STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF EXERCISE OF VARIOUS TYPES DURING PREGNANCY ON SYMPTOMS OF ANTENATAL DEPRESSION.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
11 1767  31 POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA IN PREGNANCY-RELATED COMPLICATIONS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND IMPLICATIONS FOR WORKING WOMEN. BACKGROUND: PREGNANCY IS A VULNERABLE PERIOD OF GROWTH AND ENRICHMENT ALONG WITH MANY PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CHALLENGES. THESE CHANGES CAN LEAD TO COMPLICATIONS IF COMPOUNDED BY EXTERNAL STRESS AND ANXIETY. COVID-19 HAS EMERGED AS A CHIEF STRESSOR AMONG THE GENERAL POPULATION AND IS A SERIOUS THREAT AMONG VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. THEREFORE, THERE IS A NEED FOR STRESS MANAGEMENT TOOLS, SUCH AS YOGA AND PHYSICAL EXERCISES, BOTH AT HOME AND AT WORK. THESE CAN BE ADOPTED DURING THE PANDEMIC WITH PROPER MAINTENANCE OF SOCIAL DISTANCING. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE AND COMPILE LITERATURE THAT HAS REPORTED THE HEALTH OUTCOMES OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON PREGNANCY AT THE WORKPLACE AND ANALYZES BOTH THE RESTRICTIONS AS WELL AS ADVANTAGES OF ITS BENEFICIAL EFFECTS IN COMPARISON TO PHYSICAL EXERCISES. METHODOLOGY: A COMPREHENSIVE LITERATURE REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED UTILIZING PUBMED AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR. THE KEYWORDS USED FOR THE SEARCH INCLUDE "YOGA", "WORK", "COMPLICATIONS", "PHYSICAL EXERCISE", "DRUGS" AND "COVID" INDIFFERENT PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS WITH "PREGNANCY". WE COMPILED THE LITERATURE WITH RESPECT TO PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS AND THE EFFECTS OF DRUGS, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND YOGA FOR PREVENTING THESE COMPLICATIONS. RESULTS: WE NOTED THAT PREGNANCY-RELATED COMPLICATIONS ARE BECOMING MORE PREVALENT BECAUSE OF A SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE, RESTRICTED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND GROWING STRESS. IN SUCH SITUATIONS, A HOME OR WORKPLACE YOGA PROTOCOL CAN COMBINE BOTH EXERCISE AND MINDFULNESS-BASED ALLEVIATION OF ANXIETY FOR BOTH WORKING AND NON-WORKING WOMEN. CONCLUSION: YOGA CAN BE EFFECTIVE FOR COMBATING STRESS AND ANXIETY BESIDES BOOSTING IMMUNITY IN PREGNANT WORKING WOMEN CONFRONTED WITH THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
12 1918  24 ROLE OF YOGA AND MEDITATION AS COMPLIMENTARY THERAPEUTIC REGIME FOR STRESS-RELATED NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS: UTILIZATION OF BRAIN WAVES ACTIVITY AS NOVEL TOOL. DURING RECENT DECADES, STRESS-RELATED NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS SUCH AS ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, CHRONIC TENSION HEADACHE, AND MIGRAINE HAVE ESTABLISHED THEIR STRONGHOLD IN THE LIVES OF A VAST NUMBER OF PEOPLE WORLDWIDE. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS GLOBAL PHENOMENON, INTENSIVE STUDIES HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT LEADING TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF DRUGS LIKE ANTI-DEPRESSANTS, ANXIOLYTICS, AND ANALGESICS WHICH ALTHOUGH HELP IN COMBATING THE SYMPTOMS OF SUCH DISORDERS BUT ALSO CREATE LONG-TERM SIDE EFFECTS. THUS, AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO SUCH CLINICAL PRACTICES, VARIOUS COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES SUCH AS YOGA AND MEDITATION HAVE BEEN PROVED TO BE EFFECTIVE IN ALLEVIATING THE CAUSES AND SYMPTOMS OF DIFFERENT NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS. THE ROLE OF ALTERED BRAIN WAVES IN THIS CONTEXT HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AND NEEDS TO BE PURSUED AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. THUS, THE CURRENT STUDY PROVIDES A REVIEW FOCUSED ON DESCRIBING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND MEDITATION ON ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AS WELL AS EXPLORING BRAIN WAVES AS A TOOL FOR ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL OF THESE COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES FOR SUCH DISORDERS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
13 2485  25 YOGA AS AN ANCILLARY TREATMENT FOR NEUROLOGICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS: A REVIEW. YOGA IS GAINING ACCEPTANCE AS AN ANCILLARY MEDICAL TREATMENT, BUT THERE HAVE BEEN FEW STUDIES EVALUATING ITS THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS IN NEUROLOGICAL AND MAJOR PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS. THE AUTHORS REVIEWED THE LITERATURE IN ENGLISH ON THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR THESE DISORDERS. ONLY RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE INCLUDED, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ONLY STUDY OF YOGA FOR BIPOLAR DISORDER, WHICH WAS OBSERVATIONAL. TRIALS WERE EXCLUDED IF YOGA WAS NOT THE CENTRAL COMPONENT OF THE INTERVENTION. OF SEVEN RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIALS OF YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS, SIX FOUND SIGNIFICANT, POSITIVE EFFECTS. OF 13 RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIALS OF YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS, 10 FOUND SIGNIFICANT, POSITIVE EFFECTS. THESE RESULTS, ALTHOUGH ENCOURAGING, INDICATE THAT ADDITIONAL RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO CRITICALLY DEFINE THE BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR BOTH NEUROLOGICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
14 2670  18 YOGA IN PREGNANCY. YOGA IS A MIND-BODY PRACTICE THAT ENCOMPASSES A SYSTEM OF POSTURES (ASANA), DEEP BREATHING (PRANAYAMA), AND MEDITATION. OVER 36 MILLION AMERICANS PRACTICE YOGA OF WHICH THE MAJORITY ARE REPRODUCTIVE-AGED WOMEN. LITERATURE TO SUPPORT THIS PRACTICE IS LIMITED, ALBEIT ON THE RISE. A PRENATAL YOGA PRACTICE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BENEFIT WOMEN WHO SUFFER FROM ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, STRESS, LOW BACK PAIN, AND SLEEP DISTURBANCES. A SMALL NUMBER OF STUDIES HAVE BEEN PERFORMED IN HIGH-RISK PREGNANCIES THAT ALSO DEMONSTRATE AN IMPROVEMENT IN OUTCOMES. THE SAFETY OF PERFORMING YOGA FOR THE FIRST TIME IN PREGNANCY AND FETAL TOLERANCE HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
15 2610  33 YOGA FOR REDUCING PERCEIVED STRESS AND BACK PAIN AT WORK. BACKGROUND: STRESS AND BACK PAIN ARE TWO KEY FACTORS LEADING TO SICKNESS ABSENCE AT WORK. RECENT RESEARCH INDICATES THAT YOGA CAN BE EFFECTIVE FOR REDUCING PERCEIVED STRESS, ALLEVIATING BACK PAIN, AND IMPROVING PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING. AIMS: TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION FOR REDUCING PERCEIVED STRESS AND BACK PAIN AT WORK. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED FROM A BRITISH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY AND RANDOMIZED INTO A YOGA GROUP WHO RECEIVED ONE 50 MIN DRU YOGA SESSION EACH WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS AND A 20 MIN DVD FOR HOME PRACTICE AND A CONTROL GROUP WHO RECEIVED NO INTERVENTION. BASELINE AND END-PROGRAMME MEASUREMENTS OF SELF-REPORTED STRESS, BACK PAIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING WERE ASSESSED WITH THE PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE, ROLAND MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE AND THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECT SCALE. RESULTS: THERE WERE 37 PARTICIPANTS IN EACH GROUP. ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE AND MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION SHOWED THAT IN COMPARISON TO THE CONTROL GROUP, THE YOGA GROUP REPORTED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN PERCEIVED STRESS AND BACK PAIN, AND A SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT IN PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING. WHEN COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP AT THE END OF THE PROGRAMME, THE YOGA GROUP SCORES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER FOR PERCEIVED STRESS, BACK PAIN, SADNESS AND HOSTILITY, AND SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER FOR FEELING SELF-ASSURED, ATTENTIVE AND SERENE. CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT A WORKPLACE YOGA INTERVENTION CAN REDUCE PERCEIVED STRESS AND BACK PAIN AND IMPROVE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING. LARGER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS ARE NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE BROADER EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR IMPROVING WORKPLACE PRODUCTIVITY AND REDUCING SICKNESS ABSENCE.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
16 2023  35 SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF YOGA FOR SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT DURING CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. INTRODUCTION: BREAST CANCER IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY DIAGNOSED CANCERS IN WOMEN IN THE US, AND ITS TREATMENTS HAVE SIGNIFICANT PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SIDE EFFECTS AND LONG-TERM COMPLICATIONS CAUSING SIGNIFICANT MORBIDITY AND DECREASED QUALITY OF LIFE. INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE MODALITIES, SUCH AS YOGA, HAVE BEEN FOUND TO REDUCE SIDE EFFECTS OF CONVENTIONAL TREATMENTS WITHOUT INTERFERING WITH THE TREATMENT ITSELF AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE. IN THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW, WE SPECIFICALLY EXPLORED YOGA AS A POTENTIAL OPTION FOR SYMPTOMATIC MANAGEMENT IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING CONVENTIONAL BREAST CANCER TREATMENTS. METHODS: WE PERFORMED A LITERATURE SEARCH THAT WAS CONDUCTED TO INCLUDE THE DATABASES PUBMED, PSYCHINFO, COCHRANE LIBRARY, SCOPUS, AND CINAHL, RESULTING IN 28 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) ARTICLES. WE REVIEW THE RESULTS OF THESE TRIALS REGARDING THE IMPACT OF YOGA IN THIS PATIENT POPULATION. RESULTS: OVERALL, THE MAJORITY OF THE RCT ARTICLES SHOWED SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS OF YOGA INTERVENTION IN VARIOUS ASPECTS OF QUALITY OF LIFE, FATIGUE, NAUSEA/VOMITING, SLEEP QUALITY, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND DISTRESS. THERE ARE SEVERAL STUDIES THAT HAVE EXPLORED THE PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISM BEHIND THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND FOUND THAT YOGA AFFECTS BOTH THE IMMUNE RESPONSE AND INFLAMMATION. DISCUSSION: THESE STUDIES REVEALED THAT YOGA HAS A POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC ROLE IN THE SYMPTOMATIC MANAGEMENT OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS, ENHANCING QUALITY OF LIFE DURING TREATMENT AS WELL AS IMPROVING ADHERENCE TO TREATMENT. FUTURE STUDIES WITH MORE DEFINED AND CONSISTENT METHODOLOGIES ARE NECESSARY TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL USE OF YOGA THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
17 2927  33 [YOGA FOR MENTAL DISORDERS]. BACKGROUND: THE DEMAND FOR COMPLEMENTARY CLINICALLY EFFICACIOUS, SAFE, PATIENT ACCEPTABLE, AND COST-EFFECTIVE FORMS OF TREATMENT FOR MENTAL ILLNESS IS GROWING. YOGA HAS BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON SOMATIC AND MENTAL HEALTH FACTORS; THEREFORE, YOGA HAS PREVENTIVE AND THERAPEUTIC CAPABILITIES TO IMPROVE MENTAL DYSFUNCTION. OBJECTIVE: IN THIS OVERVIEW OF THE CURRENT LITERATURE, THE EVIDENCE OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SELECTED MAJOR PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS IS SUMMARIZED. RESULTS: THE STRONGEST EVIDENCE BASE FOR YOGA EXISTS IN REDUCING DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS BUT ITS USE IN MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS IS LESS CLEAR. THE EVIDENCE FOR THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR ANXIETY DISORDERS, AND POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) IS ENCOURAGING, BUT NOT DEFINITIVE DUE TO ONLY A FEW RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS AND METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS. CONCLUSION: THERE IS PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE THAT MEDITATION-BASED YOGA INTERVENTIONS MAY BE HELPFUL FOR DEPRESSION, ANXIETY AND PTSD; HOWEVER, THERE MAY ALSO BE THE RISK OF ENGAGING IN EXTREME YOGA PRACTICES. THE VALUE OF INTEGRATING YOGA INTO A TREATMENT PLAN FOR PATIENTS WITH PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS NEEDS TO BE EVALUATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS CAN MOTIVATE AND HELP PATIENTS EVALUATE WHETHER A GIVEN YOGA CLASS IS HELPFUL AND SAFE FOR THEM. METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS AND THE UNCLEAR RISK-BENEFIT RATIO PRECLUDE DEFINITIVE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT TREATMENT.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
18 2087  34 THE EFFECT OF MUSIC, MASSAGE, YOGA AND EXERCISE ON ANTENATAL DEPRESSION: A META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: PRENATAL DEPRESSION AFFECTS 20.7 PERCENT OF WOMEN WORLDWIDE, WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH PRETERM BIRTH, LOW BIRTH WEIGHT AND APGAR SCORE, AS WELL AS COGNITIVE, EMOTIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL DEVELOPMENT DISORDERS. WE CONDUCTED A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS TO RETRIEVE THE LATEST AND BEST EVIDENCE ABOUT MUSIC, MASSAGE, YOGA AND EXERCISE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF PRENATAL DEPRESSION, AND TO PRELIMINARILY COMPARE THE FOUR METHODS TO EXPLORE THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS. WE ALSO COMPARED DIFFERENT TYPES OF YOGA AND MUSIC, IN ORDER TO FIND THE MOST EFFECTIVE TYPE OF INTERVENTION. METHODS: A COMPREHENSIVE LITERATURE SEARCH WAS CARRIED OUT THROUGH SIX DATABASES ON RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS). EFFECTS WERE SUMMARIZED BY A RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL USING MEAN DIFFERENCES WITH 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS. EVIDENCE QUALITY WAS ASSESSED USING THE GRADING OF RECOMMENDATIONS ASSESSMENT, DEVELOPMENT, AND EVALUATION (GRADE) CRITERIA. RESULTS: THIS RESEARCH FOUND LOW TO VERY LOW EVIDENCE THAT YOGA, EXERCISE, MUSIC AND MASSAGE COULD REDUCE ANTENATAL DEPRESSION. AMONG THEM, MUSIC MAY BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION, AND INTEGRATED YOGA OTHER THAN SIMPLE YOGA WOULD IMPROVE PRENATAL DEPRESSION. THE EFFECT OF CHINESE MEDICINE FIVE ELEMENT MUSIC MAY BE BETTER THAN ORDINARY MUSIC. CONCLUSION: IT IS IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT PRENATAL DEPRESSION PATIENTS TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR BEHAVIOR THERAPY.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
19 1588  36 MEDICAL YOGA: ANOTHER WAY OF BEING IN THE WORLD-A PHENOMENOLOGICAL STUDY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF PERSONS SUFFERING FROM STRESS-RELATED SYMPTOMS. THE PREVALENCE OF STRESS-RELATED ILLNESS HAS GROWN IN RECENT YEARS. MANY OF THESE PATIENTS SEEK HELP IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE. YOGA CAN REDUCE STRESS AND THUS COMPLEMENTS PHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPY IN MEDICAL PRACTICE. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, NO STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED PATIENTS' EXPERIENCES OF YOGA TREATMENT IN A PRIMARY HEALTH CARE SETTING OR, SPECIFICALLY, THE EXPERIENCES OF YOGA WHEN SUFFERING FROM STRESS-RELATED ILLNESS. THUS, THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE THE MEANING OF PARTICIPATING IN MEDICAL YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR STRESS-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSIS IN A PRIMARY HEALTH CARE SETTING. THIS STUDY HAS A DESCRIPTIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL DESIGN AND TOOK PLACE AT A PRIMARY HEALTH CARE CENTRE IN SWEDEN DURING 2011. FIVE WOMEN AND ONE MAN (43-51 YEARS) PARTICIPATED. THEY WERE RECRUITED FROM THE INTERVENTION GROUP (N=18) IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL, IN WHICH THEY HAD PARTICIPATED IN A MEDICAL YOGA GROUP IN ADDITION TO STANDARD CARE FOR 12 WEEKS. DATA WERE COLLECTED BY MEANS OF QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS, AND A PHENOMENOLOGICAL DATA ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED. THE ESSENTIAL MEANING OF THE MEDICAL YOGA EXPERIENCE WAS THAT THE MEDICAL YOGA WAS NOT AN ENDPOINT OF RECOVERY BUT THE START OF A PROCESS TOWARDS AN INCREASED SENSE OF WHOLENESS. IT WAS DESCRIBED AS A WAY OF ALLEVIATING SUFFERING, AND IT PROVIDED THE PARTICIPANTS WITH A TOOL FOR DEALING WITH THEIR STRESS AND CURRENT SITUATION ON A PRACTICAL LEVEL. IT LED TO GREATER SELF-AWARENESS AND SELF-ESTEEM, WHICH IN TURN HAD AN IMPLICIT IMPACT ON THEIR LIFEWORLD. IN PHENOMENOLOGICAL TERMS, THIS CAN BE SUMMARIZED AS ANOTHER WAY OF BEING IN THE WORLD, ENCOMPASSING A PERCEPTION OF DEEPENED IDENTITY. FROM A PHILOSOPHICAL PERSPECTIVE, DUE TO USING THE BODY IN A NEW WAY (YOGA), THE PARTICIPANTS HAD LEARNT TO SEE THINGS DIFFERENTLY, WHICH ENRICHED AND RECAST THEIR PERCEPTION OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR LIVES.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
20 2589  29 YOGA FOR LOW BACK PAIN: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS. IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT YOGA HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON LOW BACK PAIN AND FUNCTION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AS A TREATMENT OPTION FOR LOW BACK PAIN. SEVEN DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FROM THEIR INCEPTION TO MARCH 2011. RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS WERE CONSIDERED IF THEY INVESTIGATED YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH LOW BACK PAIN AND IF THEY ASSESSED PAIN AS AN OUTCOME MEASURE. THE SELECTION OF STUDIES, DATA EXTRACTION AND VALIDATION WERE PERFORMED INDEPENDENTLY BY TWO REVIEWERS. SEVEN RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS (RCTS) MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. THEIR METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY RANGED BETWEEN 2 AND 4 ON THE JADAD SCALE. FIVE RCTS SUGGESTED THAT YOGA LEADS TO A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER REDUCTION IN LOW BACK PAIN THAN USUAL CARE, EDUCATION OR CONVENTIONAL THERAPEUTIC EXERCISES. TWO RCTS SHOWED NO BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCES. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT YOGA HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ALLEVIATE LOW BACK PAIN. HOWEVER, ANY DEFINITIVE CLAIMS SHOULD BE TREATED WITH CAUTION.	2011

1 2172 118 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON DEPRESSION AND MOTOR FUNCTION IN PATIENTS WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE: A REVIEW OF CONTROLLED STUDIES. BACKGROUND: PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD) IS A NEURODEGENERATIVE/NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDER CHARACTERIZED BY BOTH MOTOR AND NON-MOTOR SYMPTOMOLOGY. THE REPORTED PREVALENCE OF DEPRESSION IN PATIENTS WITH PD IS DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN DUE TO OVERLAPPING SOMATIC SYMPTOMS AND FAILURE TO SELF-REPORT SYMPTOMS. ALTHOUGH ANTIDEPRESSANTS REMAIN A FIRST-LINE TREATMENT, THEY CAN HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS. RECENTLY, LITERATURE HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT DUE TO ITS ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PROPERTIES, YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE NONPHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY FOR DEPRESSION. METHODS: A SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) PUBLISHED FROM JANUARY 2000 TO JANUARY 2019 THAT ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON DEPRESSION AND MOTOR FUNCTIONING IN PD. RESULTS: THREE STUDIES MET THE CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION. IN ONE RCT, BIWEEKLY YOGA RESULTED IN A DECREASE IN DEPRESSION SCORE (P = .056). IN ANOTHER RCT, WEEKLY YOGA RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN DEPRESSION AND DEMONSTRATED THAT ITS THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS ARE LONG-LASTING. FINALLY, IN A THIRD RCT, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND BETWEEN CONTROL AND EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS IN DEPRESSION AFTER BIWEEKLY YOGA. HOWEVER, YOGA WAS FOUND TO BE PROTECTIVE AGAINST WORSENING OF DEPRESSION. CONCLUSIONS: OUR REVIEW SUGGESTS THAT THE PRACTICE OF YOGA MAY BE A USEFUL NONPHARMACOLOGIC ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION IN PATIENTS WITH PD. HOWEVER, MORE CONTROLLED RCTS ARE NEEDED TO VALIDATE OUR CONCLUSIONS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
2 2268  38 THE RATIONALE OF YOGA IN PARKINSON'S DISEASE: A CRITICAL REVIEW. BACKGROUND: PATIENTS WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD) COMMONLY USE COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICATIONS. YOGA IS A MIND-BODY INTERVENTION THAT IS BEING INCREASINGLY EXPLORED AS A TOOL IN THE THERAPEUTIC ARMAMENTARIUM OF PD. OBJECTIVE: TO CRITICALLY EVALUATE THE STUDIES AND SUMMARIZE THE UTILITY OF YOGA IN PD. MATERIAL AND METHODS: WE PERFORMED A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE SEARCH IN THE MEDLINE AND COCHRANE DATABASES AND INCLUDED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCT) OF YOGA IN PD. THE STUDIES WERE EVALUATED FOR INTERNAL VALIDITY AND THE RELEVANT DATA WERE EXTRACTED. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF SEVEN STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. WE COLLATED THE DATA ON THE CHANGES IN MOTOR FUNCTION, GAIT AND BALANCE PARAMETERS, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND QUALITY OF LIFE SCORES OBSERVED AFTER INTERVENTION (YOGA) IN PATIENTS WITH PD AND HIGHLIGHTED THE LIMITATIONS OF THESE STUDIES. CONCLUSION: ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND BALANCE ISSUES IN PD MAY BENEFIT FROM YOGA. YOGA HAS POTENTIAL AS AN ADD-ON THERAPY IN PD.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
3 2020  47 SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN PEOPLE WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE. PURPOSE: YOGA MAY BE A BENEFICIAL TREATMENT FOR PEOPLE WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD). HOWEVER, NO STUDIES HAVE CRITICALLY REVIEWED AND META-ANALYZED THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE FOR YOGA'S BENEFITS REGARDING MOTOR AND NON-MOTOR SYMPTOMS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO CONDUCT A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AS A REHABILITATION STRATEGY FOR PD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FOLLOWING THE PREFERRED REPORTING ITEMS FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND META-ANALYSES GUIDELINES, A LITERATURE SEARCH WAS PERFORMED USING MEDLINE/PUBMED, PEDRO, SPORTDISCUS, AND SCOPUS. STUDIES ADDRESSING ANY CONCEPTS ON THE IMPACT OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES IN PEOPLE WITH PD WERE INCLUDED. RESULTS: FOURTEEN RCTS WERE SELECTED, WITH HETEROGENEOUS PROTOCOLS AND OUTCOMES MEASURES. YOGA INTERVENTIONS WERE SAFE AND WELL-ACCEPTED FOR PATIENTS WITH MILD TO MODERATE PD. THE DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT ITS PRACTICE MIGHT PROVIDE BOTH PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFITS. PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE SHOWED THAT YOGA HAS COMPARABLE OR SUPERIOR EFFICACY TO EXERCISE. A SUBSEQUENT META-ANALYSIS ON FIVE RCTS DETECTED THAT YOGA WAS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN PASSIVE CONTROL IN AMELIORATING MOTOR SYMPTOMS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA APPEARS TO BE A PROMISING REHABILITATIVE THERAPY FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH PD. RECOMMENDATIONS ARE PROPOSED FOR FUTURE STUDIES.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONYOGA IS A SAFE AND FEASIBLE THERAPY FOR PEOPLE WITH MILD TO MODERATE PD.YOGA PRACTICE POSITIVELY IMPACTS PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH IN THIS POPULATION.WHEN COMPARED TO EXERCISE, YOGA SHOWED TO HAVE SIMILAR OR EVEN GREATER EFFECTS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
4 2488  33 YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR THE REDUCTION OF SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW IS TO EVALUATE THE IMPLEMENTATION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR THE REDUCTION OF SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION IN YOUTH. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THERE ARE NO SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS TO DATE LOOKING AT THE REDUCTION OF SYMPTOMS OF BOTH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. METHODS: NUMEROUS SCIENTIFIC DATABASES WERE SEARCHED UP TO NOVEMBER 2018 FOR EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES ASSESSING CHANGES IN SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AND/OR DEPRESSION IN YOUTHS FOLLOWING YOGA INTERVENTIONS. QUALITY AND LEVEL OF EVIDENCE WERE ASSESSED, AND INFORMATION WAS SYNTHESIZED ACROSS STUDIES. RESULTS: TWENTY-SEVEN STUDIES INVOLVING YOUTH WITH VARYING HEALTH STATUSES WERE REVIEWED. INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS VARIED GREATLY ACROSS STUDIES REVEALING MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT MAY IMPACT INTERVENTION EFFICACY, HOWEVER 70% OF THE STUDIES OVERALL SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS. FOR STUDIES ASSESSING ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, 58% SHOWED REDUCTIONS IN BOTH SYMPTOMS, WHILE 25% SHOWED REDUCTIONS IN ANXIETY ONLY. ADDITIONALLY, 70% OF STUDIES ASSESSING ANXIETY ALONE SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS AND 40% OF STUDIES ONLY ASSESSING DEPRESSION SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS. CONCLUSION: THE STUDIES REVIEWED, WHILE OF WEAK TO MODERATE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY, SHOWED THAT YOGA, DEFINED BY THE PRACTICE OF POSTURES, GENERALLY LEADS TO SOME REDUCTIONS IN ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION IN YOUTH REGARDLESS OF HEALTH STATUS AND INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
5 2609  48 YOGA FOR QUALITY OF LIFE IN INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC DISEASE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC DISEASES, INCLUDING HEART DISEASE, STROKE, CANCER, AND CHRONIC PULMONARY DISEASE ARE THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH AND DISABILITY WORLDWIDE. COMPOUNDING SYMPTOMS AND LOSS OF FUNCTION, PEOPLE LIVING WITH CHRONIC DISEASE OFTEN EXPERIENCE REDUCED QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). VARIOUS PHYSICAL AND MENTAL PRACTICES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO RELIEVE STRESS AND IMPROVE QOL. YOGA IS A PHYSICAL AND MENTAL PRACTICE THAT MAY BE A VIABLE APPROACH FOR IMPROVING QOL IN PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC DISEASE. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE AND SUMMARIZE THE EVIDENCE FOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA ON QOL IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC DISEASE. DESIGN: THE STUDY DESIGN WAS A A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WITH QUALITATIVE SYNTHESIS. METHODS: WE INCLUDED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS THAT EVALUATED THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON QOL OR HEALTH-RELATED QOL (HRQOL) FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC DISEASE. WE INCLUDED ONLY STUDIES THAT USED AT LEAST 1 PREVIOUSLY VALIDATED MEASURE OF QOL OR HRQOL AND SPECIFIED A MINIMUM DURATION OF FOLLOW-UP OF AT LEAST 1 WK. INTERVENTIONS: WE INCLUDED BOTH MOVEMENT-BASED AND BREATH-BASED YOGA PRACTICES. STUDIES THAT INCLUDED YOGA AS PART OF A LARGER INTERVENTION PROGRAM (EG, MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION TRAINING) OR STUDIES THAT DID NOT PROVIDE FINDINGS SPECIFIC TO YOGA WERE EXCLUDED. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: THE PRIMARY OUTCOME ANALYZED WAS IMPROVEMENT IN QOL AS MEASURED BY A VALIDATED QOL OR HRQOL SCALE. RESULTS: AMONG THE 1488 STUDIES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED ON INITIAL SEARCH, 7 ARTICLES MET ALL INCLUSION CRITERIA. FIVE STUDIES REPORTED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE OVER USUAL CARE ALONE FOR IMPROVEMENT OF QOL IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC DISEASE, BUT THE CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DIFFERENCES WAS CLEAR IN ONLY 1 TRIAL. WE FOUND CONSIDERABLE HETEROGENEITY AMONG THE INCLUDED STUDIES AND STUDY QUALITY WAS GENERALLY LOW. CONCLUSIONS: MORE HIGH-QUALITY RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE VALUE OF YOGA AS AN ADJUNCTIVE APPROACH TO IMPROVING QOL IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC DISEASE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
6 1079  35 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND PHYSICAL HEALTH OF PATIENTS WITH CANCER: A META-ANALYSIS. YOGA IS ONE OF THE MOST WIDELY USED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE THERAPIES TO MANAGE ILLNESS. THIS META-ANALYSIS AIMED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND PHYSICAL HEALTH OF PATIENTS WITH CANCER. STUDIES WERE IDENTIFIED THROUGH A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH OF SEVEN ELECTRONIC DATABASES AND WERE SELECTED IF THEY USED A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL DESIGN TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER. THE QUALITY OF EACH ARTICLE WAS RATED BY TWO OF THE AUTHORS USING THE PEDRO SCALE. TEN ARTICLES WERE SELECTED; THEIR PEDRO SCORES RANGED FROM 4 TO 7. THE YOGA GROUPS COMPARED TO WAITLIST CONTROL GROUPS OR SUPPORTIVE THERAPY GROUPS SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH: ANXIETY (P = .009), DEPRESSION (P = .002), DISTRESS (P = .003), AND STRESS (P = .006). HOWEVER, DUE TO THE MIXED AND LOW TO FAIR QUALITY AND SMALL NUMBER OF STUDIES CONDUCTED, THE FINDINGS ARE PRELIMINARY AND LIMITED AND SHOULD BE CONFIRMED THROUGH HIGHER-QUALITY, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
7  559  41 COULD YOGA PRACTICE IMPROVE TREATMENT-RELATED SIDE EFFECTS AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER? A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. AIM: TO DETERMINE IF YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPY WAS ASSOCIATED WITH ENHANCED HEALTH AND TREATMENT-RELATED SIDE EFFECTS IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW EXAMINES WHETHER YOGA PRACTICE PROVIDES ANY MEASURABLE BENEFIT, BOTH PHYSICALLY AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY, FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER. METHODS: PUBMED, EMBASE AND THE COCHRANE LIBRARY FOR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) THROUGHOUT JUNE 2013. WE EVALUATED THE QUALITY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES BY THE COCHRANE HANDBOOK 5.2 STANDARDS AND ANALYZED THE DATA USING THE STATA SOFTWARE, VERSION 10.0. META-REGRESSION AND SUBGROUP ANALYSIS WERE ALSO PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL PREDICTORS OF OUTCOME AND TO ASSESS HETEROGENEITY. RESULTS: SIXTEEN RCTS WITH A TOTAL OF 930 PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED. COMPARING YOGA GROUPS TO CONTROL GROUPS, THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN OVERALL HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY AND GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS. META-REGRESSION ANALYSES REVEALED THAT THE DURATION OF YOGA PRACTICE AND TYPE OF CONTROL GROUP PARTLY EXPLAINED THE HETEROGENEITY. SUBGROUP ANALYSES REVEALED THAT YOGA HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON ANXIETY ONLY WHEN IT HAD BEEN PRACTICED FOR LONGER THAN 3 MONTHS. ONLY THE WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP SHOWED AN EFFECT OF YOGA ON PHYSICAL WELL-BEING. CONCLUSION: THE CURRENT EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATES THAT YOGA PRACTICE COULD BE EFFECTIVE IN ENHANCING HEALTH AND MANAGING SOME TREATMENT-RELATED SIDE EFFECTS FOR PATIENTS RECOVERING FROM BREAST CANCER. IN FUTURE CLINICAL STUDIES, CLINICIANS SHOULD CONSIDER THE PATIENT'S WISHES ALONG WITH THE CURRENT BEST EVIDENCE OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA PRACTICE IN THEIR CLINICAL DECISION-MAKING.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
8 2485  34 YOGA AS AN ANCILLARY TREATMENT FOR NEUROLOGICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS: A REVIEW. YOGA IS GAINING ACCEPTANCE AS AN ANCILLARY MEDICAL TREATMENT, BUT THERE HAVE BEEN FEW STUDIES EVALUATING ITS THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS IN NEUROLOGICAL AND MAJOR PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS. THE AUTHORS REVIEWED THE LITERATURE IN ENGLISH ON THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR THESE DISORDERS. ONLY RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE INCLUDED, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE ONLY STUDY OF YOGA FOR BIPOLAR DISORDER, WHICH WAS OBSERVATIONAL. TRIALS WERE EXCLUDED IF YOGA WAS NOT THE CENTRAL COMPONENT OF THE INTERVENTION. OF SEVEN RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIALS OF YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS, SIX FOUND SIGNIFICANT, POSITIVE EFFECTS. OF 13 RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIALS OF YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS, 10 FOUND SIGNIFICANT, POSITIVE EFFECTS. THESE RESULTS, ALTHOUGH ENCOURAGING, INDICATE THAT ADDITIONAL RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO CRITICALLY DEFINE THE BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR BOTH NEUROLOGICAL AND PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
9 2915  41 [SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF YOGA FOR DEPRESSION AND QUALITY OF SLEEP IN THE ELDERLY]. BACKGROUND: AGING AND AGE-RELATED HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE MAJOR ISSUES OF CONCERN FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH SERVICES. YOGA IS AN EXERCISE WITH BOTH PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS ON AGING. ALTHOUGH MANY STUDIES HAVE ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN THE ELDERLY, LITTLE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE IN THE LITERATURE TO SUPPORT EMPIRICAL CONCLUSIONS. PURPOSE: THIS REVIEW SYNTHESIZES AND CHARACTERIZES FINDINGS RELATED TO THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON DEPRESSION AND QUALITY OF SLEEP IN THE ELDERLY. METHODS: RESEARCHERS USED KEYWORDS INCLUDING YOGA, ELDERLY, AGED / OLDER ADULT, DEPRESSION, SLEEP, AND QUALITY TO SEARCH 6 ELECTRONIC DATABASES FOR RELEVANT STUDIES PUBLISHED PRIOR TO MARCH 2013. INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA WERE USED TO SCREEN IDENTIFIED STUDY ABSTRACTS. THE JADAD SCALE APPRAISED THE QUALITY OF IDENTIFIED STUDIES. RESULTS: SEVEN STUDIES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. FIVE STUDIES FOUND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PARTICIPANT DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AFTER DOING YOGA. THREE STUDIES FOUND SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON THE QUALITY OF SLEEP OF PARTICIPANTS AFTER 6 MONTHS OF DOING YOGA. CONCLUSION: YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS OF ELDERLY PARTICIPANTS AND IMPROVED THEIR QUALITY OF SLEEP AFTER 6 MONTHS. FINDINGS WERE SIMILAR FOR ELDERLY LIVING IN INSTITUTIONS AND IN THE COMMUNITY. HOWEVER, THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE ASSESSED STUDIES WERE WOMEN CHARACTERIZED BY A HIGH LEVEL OF SOCIAL PARTICIPATION AND PROACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN HEALTH PROMOTION ACTIVITIES. FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD BROADEN THE SCOPE OF RESEARCH TO ADDRESS DIFFERENT AGING POPULATIONS AND USE LONG-TERM COHORT OBSERVATIONS IN ORDER TO BETTER ELICIT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AND TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO INTRODUCE YOGA INTO DAILY ACTIVITIES.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
10 2592  39 YOGA FOR MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AS A TREATMENT OPTION FOR MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS. METHODS: WE SEARCHED THE LITERATURE USING 14 DATABASES FROM THEIR INCEPTION TO JULY 2008 AND INCLUDED ALL TYPES OF CLINICAL STUDIES REGARDLESS OF THEIR DESIGN. THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF ALL STUDIES WAS ASSESSED USING A MODIFIED JADAD SCORE. RESULTS: SEVEN STUDIES MET OUR INCLUSION CRITERIA. TWO RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS COMPARED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA WITH THOSE OF WALKING OR PHYSICAL EXERCISE. THE META-ANALYSIS OF THESE DATA FAILED TO SHOW SPECIFIC EFFECTS OF YOGA ON MENOPAUSAL COMPLAINTS INCLUDING PSYCHOLOGICAL, SOMATIC, AND VASOMOTOR SYMPTOMS. TWO RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS FOUND NO EFFECTS OF YOGA ON TOTAL MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS COMPARED WITH WAIT-LIST CONTROL OR NO TREATMENT. THE REMAINING STUDIES WERE EITHER NON-RANDOMIZED (N = 1) OR UNCONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS (N = 3). THEY REPORTED FAVORABLE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS. THESE DATA COLLECTIVELY SHOW THAT THE RESULTS OF RIGOROUS STUDIES OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA FOR MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS ARE UNCONVINCING. CONCLUSION: THE EVIDENCE IS INSUFFICIENT TO SUGGEST THAT YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR MENOPAUSE. FURTHER RESEARCH IS REQUIRED TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER THERE ARE SPECIFIC BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR TREATING MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
11 2170  33 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON ANXIETY AND STRESS. STRESS AND ANXIETY HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED AS CONTRIBUTORS TO MANY CHRONIC DISEASES AND TO DECREASED QUALITY OF LIFE, EVEN WITH PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT. EFFORTS ARE UNDERWAY TO FIND NON-PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPIES TO RELIEVE STRESS AND ANXIETY, AND YOGA IS ONE OPTION FOR WHICH RESULTS ARE PROMISING. THE FOCUS OF THIS REVIEW IS ON THE RESULTS OF HUMAN TRIALS ASSESSING THE ROLE OF YOGA IN IMPROVING THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF STRESS AND ANXIETY. OF 35 TRIALS ADDRESSING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON ANXIETY AND STRESS, 25 NOTED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN STRESS AND/OR ANXIETY SYMPTOMS WHEN A YOGA REGIMEN WAS IMPLEMENTED; HOWEVER, MANY OF THE STUDIES WERE ALSO HINDERED BY LIMITATIONS, SUCH AS SMALL STUDY POPULATIONS, LACK OF RANDOMIZATION, AND LACK OF A CONTROL GROUP. FOURTEEN OF THE 35 STUDIES REPORTED BIOCHEMICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL MARKERS OF STRESS AND ANXIETY, BUT YIELDED INCONSISTENT SUPPORT OF YOGA FOR RELIEF OF STRESS AND ANXIETY. EVALUATION OF THE CURRENT PRIMARY LITERATURE IS SUGGESTIVE OF BENEFITS OF YOGA IN RELIEVING STRESS AND ANXIETY, BUT FURTHER INVESTIGATION INTO THIS RELATIONSHIP USING LARGE, WELL-DEFINED POPULATIONS, ADEQUATE CONTROLS, RANDOMIZATION AND LONG DURATION SHOULD BE EXPLORED BEFORE RECOMMENDING YOGA AS A TREATMENT OPTION.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
12 2383  31 YOGA & CANCER INTERVENTIONS: A REVIEW OF THE CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOMES FOR CANCER SURVIVORS. LIMITED RESEARCH SUGGESTS YOGA MAY BE A VIABLE GENTLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OPTION WITH A VARIETY OF HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, PSYCHOSOCIAL AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT BENEFITS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO DETERMINE THE CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES FROM YOGA INTERVENTIONS CONDUCTED WITH CANCER SURVIVORS. A TOTAL OF 25 PUBLISHED YOGA INTERVENTION STUDIES FOR CANCER SURVIVORS FROM 2004-2011 HAD PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES, INCLUDING QUALITY OF LIFE, PSYCHOSOCIAL OR SYMPTOM MEASURES. THIRTEEN OF THESE STUDIES MET THE NECESSARY CRITERIA TO ASSESS CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE FOR EACH OF THE OUTCOMES OF INTEREST WAS EXAMINED BASED ON 1 STANDARD ERROR OF THE MEASUREMENT, 0.5 STANDARD DEVIATION, AND RELATIVE COMPARATIVE EFFECT SIZES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE CONFIDENCE INTERVALS. THIS REVIEW DESCRIBES IN DETAIL THESE PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES, HOW THEY WERE OBTAINED, THEIR RELATIVE CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPLICATIONS FOR BOTH CLINICAL AND RESEARCH SETTINGS. OVERALL, CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES SUGGEST THAT YOGA INTERVENTIONS HOLD PROMISE FOR IMPROVING CANCER SURVIVORS' WELL-BEING. THIS RESEARCH OVERVIEW PROVIDES NEW DIRECTIONS FOR EXAMINING HOW CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE CAN PROVIDE A UNIQUE CONTEXT FOR DESCRIBING CHANGES IN PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES FROM YOGA INTERVENTIONS. RESEARCHERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO EMPLOY INDICES OF CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE IN THE INTERPRETATION AND DISCUSSION OF RESULTS FROM YOGA STUDIES.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
13 2354  34 UTILIZING YOGA IN ONCOLOGIC PATIENTS TREATED WITH RADIOTHERAPY: REVIEW. PURPOSE: SEVERAL TRIALS ON NONCANCER POPULATION INDICATE THAT YOGA IS ASSOCIATED WITH MEANINGFUL CLINICAL EFFECTS. THIS STUDY EVALUATED THE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES OF YOGA IN ONCOLOGIC PATIENTS TREATED WITH RADIOTHERAPY. METHODS: WE FOCUSED ON A RESEARCH THROUGH COCHRANE REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL), BIOMED CENTRAL, AND MEDLINE STUDIES UP TO MAY 2017. RESULTS: YOGA WAS FOUND TO HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL BENEFIT IN CANCER PATIENTS' DISTRESS, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION. IT ALSO DEMONSTRATED A MODERATE IMPACT ON FATIGUE AND EMOTIONAL FUNCTION AND A SMALL AND INSIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON FUNCTIONAL WELL-BEING AND SLEEP DISTURBANCES. AS FAR AS THE EFFECTS ON PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES ARE CONCERNED, THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE. CONCLUSIONS: THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS SHOWED THAT YOGA HAS STRONG BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON ONCOLOGIC PATIENTS' QUALITY OF LIFE. RESULTS OF THE CURRENT REVIEW MUST BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION DUE TO THE RELATIVE SMALL SAMPLE SIZES OF MOST OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES, WHILE A PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED STUDY STANDS IN NEED FOR THE CONFIRMATION OF OUR RESULTS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
14 2023  41 SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF YOGA FOR SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT DURING CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. INTRODUCTION: BREAST CANCER IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY DIAGNOSED CANCERS IN WOMEN IN THE US, AND ITS TREATMENTS HAVE SIGNIFICANT PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SIDE EFFECTS AND LONG-TERM COMPLICATIONS CAUSING SIGNIFICANT MORBIDITY AND DECREASED QUALITY OF LIFE. INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE MODALITIES, SUCH AS YOGA, HAVE BEEN FOUND TO REDUCE SIDE EFFECTS OF CONVENTIONAL TREATMENTS WITHOUT INTERFERING WITH THE TREATMENT ITSELF AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE. IN THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW, WE SPECIFICALLY EXPLORED YOGA AS A POTENTIAL OPTION FOR SYMPTOMATIC MANAGEMENT IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING CONVENTIONAL BREAST CANCER TREATMENTS. METHODS: WE PERFORMED A LITERATURE SEARCH THAT WAS CONDUCTED TO INCLUDE THE DATABASES PUBMED, PSYCHINFO, COCHRANE LIBRARY, SCOPUS, AND CINAHL, RESULTING IN 28 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) ARTICLES. WE REVIEW THE RESULTS OF THESE TRIALS REGARDING THE IMPACT OF YOGA IN THIS PATIENT POPULATION. RESULTS: OVERALL, THE MAJORITY OF THE RCT ARTICLES SHOWED SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS OF YOGA INTERVENTION IN VARIOUS ASPECTS OF QUALITY OF LIFE, FATIGUE, NAUSEA/VOMITING, SLEEP QUALITY, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND DISTRESS. THERE ARE SEVERAL STUDIES THAT HAVE EXPLORED THE PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISM BEHIND THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND FOUND THAT YOGA AFFECTS BOTH THE IMMUNE RESPONSE AND INFLAMMATION. DISCUSSION: THESE STUDIES REVEALED THAT YOGA HAS A POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC ROLE IN THE SYMPTOMATIC MANAGEMENT OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS, ENHANCING QUALITY OF LIFE DURING TREATMENT AS WELL AS IMPROVING ADHERENCE TO TREATMENT. FUTURE STUDIES WITH MORE DEFINED AND CONSISTENT METHODOLOGIES ARE NECESSARY TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL USE OF YOGA THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
15 1124  35 EFFICACY OF PRENATAL YOGA IN THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY DURING PREGNANCY: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. WOMEN COMMONLY SUFFER FROM DEPRESSION DURING PREGNANCY. FOR REDUCING DEPRESSION, YOGA SEEMS TO BE MORE SUITABLE FOR PREGNANT WOMEN THAN OTHER PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES BECAUSE OF ITS LOW EXERCISE INTENSITY. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF PRENATAL YOGA ON THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION DURING PREGNANCY. THREE ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR RELEVANT ARTICLES FROM THEIR INCEPTION TO MAY 2021, INCLUDING PUBMED, COCHRANE LIBRARY, AND SCIENCEDIRECT. PRE- AND POST-TEST OUTCOMES WERE ADOPTED TO ESTIMATE STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE WITH A 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL FOR ASSESSING THE EFFICACY OF YOGA. HETEROGENEITY AMONG ARTICLES WAS DETECTED USING I(2) VALUE. A TOTAL OF 13 ARTICLES THAT CONTAINED 379 SUBJECTS WERE INCLUDED FOR META-ANALYSIS. NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN DEPRESSION SCORES AFTER PRACTICING YOGA WAS OBSERVED FOR WOMEN WITHOUT DEPRESSION (P = 0.09) BUT SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT WAS OBSERVED FOR WOMEN WITH DEPRESSION (P = 0.001). ALTHOUGH SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ANXIETY SCORES AFTER YOGA WAS OBSERVED FOR WOMEN WITHOUT DEPRESSION (P = 0.02), THE RESULTS OF THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS WERE NOT CONSISTENT, WHILE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ANXIETY SCORES AFTER YOGA WAS ALSO OBSERVED FOR WOMEN WITH DEPRESSION (P &LT; 0.00001). THE CURRENT EVIDENCE HAS SUGGESTED THAT YOGA HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SCORES IN PREGNANT WOMEN WITH DEPRESSION. HOWEVER, THE LEVEL OF EVIDENCE OF THIS STUDY WAS NOT HIGH. MORE ARTICLES WITH HIGH LEVELS OF EVIDENCE SHOULD BE CONDUCTED TO CONFIRM OUR CONCLUSION IN THE FUTURE.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
16 1199  36 EXERCISE AND YOGA DURING PREGNANCY AND THEIR IMPACT ON DEPRESSION: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW. IT IS WELL ESTABLISHED THAT EXERCISE CAN IMPROVE DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IN THE GENERAL POPULATION; HOWEVER, IT IS NOT CLEAR IF THESE BENEFITS ARE ALSO SEEN IN PREGNANCY. THIS REVIEW AIMED TO SYNTHESIZE THE EVIDENCE THAT EXAMINES WHETHER EXERCISE DURING PREGNANCY IMPACTS DEPRESSIVE AND ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS (E.G. ANXIETY) DURING THE PERINATAL PERIOD. THE REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH PRISMA GUIDELINES AND REPORTING CRITERIA; LITERATURE WAS SEARCHED USING PUBMED, SCOPUS AND WEB OF SCIENCE DATABASE ENGINES. CLINICAL TRIALS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH EVALUATING THE EFFECTS OF A DEFINED EXERCISE PROTOCOL DURING PREGNANCY ON DEPRESSIVE AND/OR ANXIETY SYMPTOMS DURING THE PERINATAL PERIOD WERE INCLUDED. STUDIES WITHOUT A CONTROL GROUP WERE EXCLUDED. RISK OF BIAS WAS CONDUCTED BY COCHRANE ASSESSMENT TO APPRAISE THE QUALITY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES. TWENTY-SEVEN ARTICLES, BETWEEN 1994 AND 2019, WERE INCLUDED. OF THESE, ONLY 5 SPECIFICALLY RECRUITED WOMEN WITH DEPRESSION (N = 334), WHICH ALL ASSESSED A YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION; 4 OF THESE STUDIES SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN DEPRESSIVE AND/OR ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP COMPARED TO BASELINE; HOWEVER, 2 OF THESE STUDIES ALSO SHOWED AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE CONTROL GROUP. THE REMAINING 22 STUDIES USED VARIOUS EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS IN PREGNANT WOMEN (N = 4808) WITH 20 STUDIES REPORTING THAT EXERCISE DURING PREGNANCY HAS THE ABILITY TO IMPROVE DEPRESSIVE AND/OR ANXIETY MEASURES IN THE PERINATAL PERIOD COMPARED TO EITHER BASELINE OR CONTROL. THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT EXERCISE OF VARIOUS TYPES IN PREGNANCY CAN REDUCE DEPRESSIVE AND/OR ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IN THE PERINATAL PERIOD IN OTHERWISE HEALTHY WOMEN. SPECIFICALLY IN WOMEN WITH ANTENATAL DEPRESSION, THE INCORPORATION OF YOGA IN PREGNANCY CAN IMPROVE DEPRESSIVE/ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IN THE PERINATAL PERIOD; HOWEVER, THIS IS BASED ON A SMALL NUMBER OF STUDIES, AND IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER THIS IS SUPERIOR TO NON-EXERCISE CONTROLS. FURTHER STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF EXERCISE OF VARIOUS TYPES DURING PREGNANCY ON SYMPTOMS OF ANTENATAL DEPRESSION.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
17  931  51 EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA THERAPY AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR MAJOR PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS: A META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA THERAPY AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS SUCH AS SCHIZOPHRENIA, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD). DATA SOURCES: ELIGIBLE TRIALS WERE IDENTIFIED BY A LITERATURE SEARCH OF PUBMED/MEDLINE, COCHRANE CONTROL TRIALS REGISTER, GOOGLE SCHOLAR, AND EBSCO ON THE BASIS OF CRITERIA OF ACCEPTABLE QUALITY AND RELEVANCE. THE SEARCH WAS PERFORMED USING THE FOLLOWING TERMS: YOGA FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA, YOGA FOR DEPRESSION, YOGA FOR ANXIETY, YOGA FOR PTSD, YOGA THERAPY, YOGA FOR PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS, COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT, AND EFFICACY OF YOGA THERAPY. TRIALS BOTH UNPUBLISHED AND PUBLISHED WITH NO LIMITATION PLACED ON YEAR OF PUBLICATION WERE INCLUDED; HOWEVER, THE OLDEST ARTICLE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL META-ANALYSIS WAS PUBLISHED IN 2000. STUDY SELECTION: ALL AVAILABLE RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIALS OF YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF MENTAL ILLNESS WERE REVIEWED, AND 10 STUDIES WERE ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION. AS VERY FEW RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED YOGA FOR MENTAL ILLNESS, THIS META-ANALYSIS INCLUDES STUDIES WITH PARTICIPANTS WHO WERE DIAGNOSED WITH MENTAL ILLNESS, AS WELL AS STUDIES WITH PARTICIPANTS WHO WERE NOT DIAGNOSED WITH MENTAL ILLNESS BUT REPORTED SYMPTOMS OF MENTAL ILLNESS. TRIALS WERE EXCLUDED DUE TO THE FOLLOWING: (1) INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION, (2) INADEQUATE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS, (3) YOGA WAS NOT THE CENTRAL COMPONENT OF THE INTERVENTION, (4) SUBJECTS WERE NOT DIAGNOSED WITH OR DID NOT REPORT EXPERIENCING SYMPTOMS OF ONE OF THE PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS OF INTEREST (IE, SCHIZOPHRENIA, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND PTSD), (5) STUDY WAS NOT REPORTED IN ENGLISH, AND (6) STUDY DID NOT INCLUDE A CONTROL GROUP. DATA EXTRACTION: DATA WERE EXTRACTED ON PARTICIPANT DIAGNOSIS, INCLUSION CRITERIA, TREATMENT AND CONTROL GROUPS, DURATION OF INTERVENTION, AND RESULTS (PRE-POST MEAN AND STANDARD DEVIATIONS, T VALUES, AND F VALUES). NUMBER, AGE, AND SEX RATIO OF PARTICIPANTS WERE ALSO OBTAINED WHEN AVAILABLE. DATA SYNTHESIS: THE COMBINED ANALYSIS OF ALL 10 STUDIES PROVIDED A POOLED EFFECT SIZE OF -3.25 (95% CI, -5.36 TO -1.14; P = .002), INDICATING THAT YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS HAVE A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT AS AN ADJUNCT TREATMENT FOR MAJOR PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS. FINDINGS IN SUPPORT OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY INTERVENTIONS MAY ESPECIALLY BE AN AID IN THE TREATMENT OF DISORDERS FOR WHICH CURRENT TREATMENTS ARE FOUND TO BE INADEQUATE OR TO CARRY SEVERE LIABILITIES. CONCLUSIONS: AS CURRENT PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS FOR SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED RISK OF WEIGHT GAIN AS WELL AS OTHER METABOLIC SIDE EFFECTS THAT INCREASE PATIENTS' RISK FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE, FAR LESS TOXIC ADJUNCT TREATMENT OPTION FOR SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS.	2011	

18 1084  33 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS MANAGEMENT IN HEALTHY ADULTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVE: THIS ARTICLE REPORTS A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON STRESS MANAGEMENT IN HEALTHY ADULTS. METHODS: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE SEARCH WAS PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) AND CLINICAL CONTROLLED TRIALS (CCTS) THAT ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS MANAGEMENT IN HEALTHY ADULTS. SELECTED STUDIES WERE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE TYPES OF INTERVENTION, DURATION, OUTCOME MEASURES, AND RESULTS. THEY WERE ALSO QUALITATIVELY ASSESSED BASED ON PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS. RESULTS: THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS BASED ON EIGHT RCTS AND CCTS THAT INDICATED A POSITIVE EFFECT OF YOGA IN REDUCING STRESS LEVELS OR STRESS SYMPTOMS. HOWEVER, MOST OF THE STUDIES HAD METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS IN THAT THE INTERVENTION DURATION WAS SHORT AND LIMITED FOLLOW-UP DATA WAS AVAILABLE. CONCLUSION: THIS REVIEW REVEALED POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS REDUCTION IN HEALTHY ADULT POPULATIONS. HOWEVER, THE RESULT SHOULD BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION DUE TO THE SMALL NUMBER OF STUDIES AND THE ASSOCIATED METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS. FURTHER STUDIES TO ASCERTAIN YOGA'S LONG-TERM EFFECTS AND THE UNDERLYING BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS LEADING TO ITS STRESS REDUCTION EFFECT SHOULD BE CONDUCTED.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
19 2194  40 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA VERSUS STRETCHING AND RESISTANCE TRAINING EXERCISES ON PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS FOR PEOPLE WITH MILD-TO-MODERATE PARKINSON'S DISEASE: STUDY PRXOTOCOL FOR A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS IS PREVALENT AMONG PEOPLE WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD) AND AGGRAVATES THEIR MOTOR SYMPTOMS, THEREBY LEADING TO INCREASED DISABILITY, HIGH HEALTHCARE COSTS, AND POOR HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL). THE UNDER-RECOGNITION AND ADVERSE EFFECTS OF THE PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AMONG THE PD POPULATION ARE CONSIDERABLE. THUS, ADOPTING A COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MANAGEMENT (CAM) APPROACH TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM IS IMPORTANT. YOGA, ONE OF THE MOST COMMON "MIND-BODY" CAM THERAPIES, CAN IMPROVE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING OF PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC ILLNESSES. HOWEVER, LIMITED RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN PEOPLE WITH PD HAS BEEN CONDUCTED. THIS STUDY WILL DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING OF PEOPLE WITH MILD-TO-MODERATE PD AND WILL COMPARE THESE EFFECTS WITH THOSE OF STRETCHING AND RESISTANCE TRAINING EXERCISES. METHODS: A COMMUNITY-BASED, SINGLE-BLIND, RANDOMIZED TRIAL WILL BE CONDUCTED. A TOTAL OF 126 SUBJECTS WILL BE RECRUITED AND RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO YOGA (N = 63) OR STRETCHING AND RESISTANCE EXERCISE (N = 63) GROUPS. FOR 8 WEEKS, THE YOGA GROUP WILL RECEIVE A WEEKLY 90-MIN SESSION OF YOGA, AND THE CONTROL GROUP WILL RECEIVE A WEEKLY 60-MIN SESSION OF STRETCHING AND RESISTANCE EXERCISES. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WILL BE THE LEVEL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS MEASURED USING THE HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE. THE SECONDARY OUTCOMES WILL INCLUDE THE SEVERITY OF MOTOR SYMPTOMS MEASURED BY THE MOVEMENT DISORDERS SOCIETY - UNIFIED PARKINSON'S DISEASE SCALE - PART III MOTOR EXAMINATION; MOBILITY, BALANCE, AND FALL RISK MEASURED BY THE TIMED UP AND GO TEST; SPIRITUAL WELLBEING MEASURED BY THE HOLISTIC WELLBEING SCALE; AND HRQOL MEASURED BY THE PARKINSON'S DISEASE QUESTIONNAIRE-8. ASSESSMENT WILL BE CONDUCTED AT BASELINE, 8TH, AND 20TH WEEKS OF FOLLOW-UPS. DISCUSSION: THIS STUDY WILL BE THE FIRST RANDOMIZED TRIAL TO COMPARE THE EFFECT OF YOGA VERSUS STRETCHING AND RESISTANCE TRAINING EXERCISES IN A PD POPULATION. RESULTS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE VALUE OF YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC OPTION FOR MANAGING PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS IN PD PATIENTS. MULTIPLE OUTCOMES INCLUDING PSYCHOLOGICAL, PHYSIOLOGICAL, AND SPIRITUAL AND HRQOL WILL ALSO BE MEASURED TO ELUCIDATE THE POTENTIAL MECHANISMS OF YOGA. THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC ILLNESSES WILL FURTHER BE ELUCIDATED. THIS INFORMATION SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO FUTURE RESEARCH, PRACTICE, AND POLICY RELATED TO PD MANAGEMENT.

20 2200  28 THE EFFICACY OF YOGA AS A FORM OF TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE WAS TO SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEW YOGA INTERVENTIONS AIMED AT IMPROVING DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. A TOTAL OF 23 INTERVENTIONS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 2011 AND MAY 2016 WERE EVALUATED IN THIS REVIEW. THREE STUDY DESIGNS WERE USED: RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS, QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL, AND PRETEST/POSTTEST, WITH MAJORITY BEING RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS. MOST OF THE STUDIES WERE IN THE UNITED STATES. VARIOUS YOGA SCHOOLS WERE USED, WITH THE MOST COMMON BEING HATHA YOGA. THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS PARTICIPATING IN THE STUDIES RANGED FROM 14 TO 136, IMPLYING THAT MOST STUDIES HAD A SMALL SAMPLE. THE DURATION OF THE INTERVENTION PERIOD VARIED GREATLY, WITH THE MAJORITY BEING 6 WEEKS OR LONGER. LIMITATIONS OF THE INTERVENTIONS INVOLVED THE SMALL SAMPLE SIZES USED BY THE MAJORITY OF THE STUDIES, MOST STUDIES EXAMINING THE SHORT-TERM EFFECT OF YOGA FOR DEPRESSION, AND THE NONUTILIZATION OF BEHAVIORAL THEORIES. DESPITE THE LIMITATIONS, IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT THE YOGA INTERVENTIONS WERE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING DEPRESSION.	2017

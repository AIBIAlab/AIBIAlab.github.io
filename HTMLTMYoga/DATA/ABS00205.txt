1  205 106 A REVIEW ON ROLE OF YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIAS. EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT YOGA IS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING VARIOUS RISK FACTORS, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), AND PSYCHOLOGICAL BURDEN THAT IS RELATED TO ARRHYTHMIA. HOWEVER, THIS IS THE FIRST-EVER SYSTEMATIC REVIEW PERFORMED TO REPORT THE ROLE OF YOGA IN ARRHYTHMIA. WE HAVE PERFORMED A LITERATURE SEARCH USING COCHRANE LIBRARY, MEDLINE/PUBMED, WEB OF SCIENCE CORE COLLECTION, AND INDMED ELECTRONIC DATABASES UP TO 3, JANUARY 2018. OF 240 ARTICLES, 6 POTENTIALLY ELIGIBLE ARTICLES WERE IDENTIFIED AND INCLUDED IN THE REVIEW. RESULTS SHOWED THAT YOGA COULD BE CONSIDERED AN EFFICIENT ADJUVANT IN REDUCING ARRHYTHMIA (PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, VENTRICULAR TACHYARRHYTHMIA, AND PALPITATION) RELATED HEALTH PROBLEMS; BLOOD PRESSURE, HEART RATE, DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SCORES; AND IN IMPROVING HEALTH-RELATED QOL OF ARRHYTHMIA PATIENTS. HOWEVER, THERE IS A LACK OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS AND A CLEAR MECHANISM BEHIND THE EFFECT OF YOGA; STUDIES HAD RELATIVELY A SMALL SAMPLE SIZE AND DIFFERENT YOGA PROTOCOLS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
2 1084  34 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS MANAGEMENT IN HEALTHY ADULTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVE: THIS ARTICLE REPORTS A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON STRESS MANAGEMENT IN HEALTHY ADULTS. METHODS: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE SEARCH WAS PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) AND CLINICAL CONTROLLED TRIALS (CCTS) THAT ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS MANAGEMENT IN HEALTHY ADULTS. SELECTED STUDIES WERE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE TYPES OF INTERVENTION, DURATION, OUTCOME MEASURES, AND RESULTS. THEY WERE ALSO QUALITATIVELY ASSESSED BASED ON PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS. RESULTS: THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS BASED ON EIGHT RCTS AND CCTS THAT INDICATED A POSITIVE EFFECT OF YOGA IN REDUCING STRESS LEVELS OR STRESS SYMPTOMS. HOWEVER, MOST OF THE STUDIES HAD METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS IN THAT THE INTERVENTION DURATION WAS SHORT AND LIMITED FOLLOW-UP DATA WAS AVAILABLE. CONCLUSION: THIS REVIEW REVEALED POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS REDUCTION IN HEALTHY ADULT POPULATIONS. HOWEVER, THE RESULT SHOULD BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION DUE TO THE SMALL NUMBER OF STUDIES AND THE ASSOCIATED METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS. FURTHER STUDIES TO ASCERTAIN YOGA'S LONG-TERM EFFECTS AND THE UNDERLYING BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS LEADING TO ITS STRESS REDUCTION EFFECT SHOULD BE CONDUCTED.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
3 2184  34 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW STUDY. INTRODUCTION: THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN MENOPAUSAL WOMEN IS CONSIDERED TO BE AN IMPORTANT HEALTH ISSUE IN DIFFERENT SOCIETIES AND ONE OF THE MAIN OBJECTIVES OF HEALTH CARE IN THIS PERIOD. THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN MENOPAUSAL WOMEN. METHOD: ENGLISH DATABASES OF GOOGLE SCHOLAR, SCIENCE DIRECT, PUBMED, SCOPUS, AND COCHRANE LIBRARY WERE SEARCHED TO ACCESS RELATED ARTICLES USING KEYWORDS OF MENOPAUSE, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND YOGA. FURTHERMORE, PERSIAN EQUIVALENTS OF THE SAME KEYWORDS WERE SEARCHED IN DATABASES OF GOOGLE SCHOLAR, SID, AND MAGIRAN, IN ADDITION TO A COMBINATION OF THE KEYWORDS. THE SEARCH INTERVAL WAS FROM THE INSPECTION TO JANUARY 2020. THE QUALITY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIED WAS ASSESSED BASED ON CONSORT 2017 CHECKLIST. RESULTS: OUT OF 120 ARTICLES FOUND IN THE DATABASES, SIX ARTICLES ENTERED THE STUDY BASED ON THE INCLUSION CRITERIA AND WERE INVESTIGATED FOR INTERVENTION METHODS AND CONSEQUENCES. THE RESULTS INDICATED THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF YOGA ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN MENOPAUSAL WOMEN. CONCLUSION: CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON THE SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN MENOPAUSAL WOMEN, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THIS LOW-COST METHOD BE USED TO IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE AND HEALTH.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
4 2539  37 YOGA FOR ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF CONTROLLED TRIALS. A GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE SUGGESTS YOGIC PRACTICES MAY BENEFIT ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES (DM2). IN THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW, WE EVALUATE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE FROM PROSPECTIVE CONTROLLED TRIALS REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA-BASED PROGRAMS ON SPECIFIC HEALTH OUTCOMES PERTINENT TO DM2 MANAGEMENT. TO IDENTIFY QUALIFYING STUDIES, WE SEARCHED NINE DATABASES AND SCANNED BIBLIOGRAPHIES OF RELEVANT REVIEW PAPERS AND ALL IDENTIFIED ARTICLES. CONTROLLED TRIALS THAT DID NOT TARGET ADULTS WITH DIABETES, INCLUDED ONLY ADULTS WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES, WERE UNDER TWO-WEEK DURATION, OR DID NOT INCLUDE QUANTITATIVE OUTCOME DATA WERE EXCLUDED. STUDY QUALITY WAS EVALUATED USING THE PEDRO SCALE. THIRTY-THREE PAPERS REPORTING FINDINGS FROM 25 CONTROLLED TRIALS (13 NONRANDOMIZED, 12 RANDOMIZED) MET OUR INCLUSION CRITERIA (N = 2170 PARTICIPANTS). COLLECTIVELY, FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGIC PRACTICES MAY PROMOTE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN SEVERAL INDICES OF IMPORTANCE IN DM2 MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING GLYCEMIC CONTROL, LIPID LEVELS, AND BODY COMPOSITION. MORE LIMITED DATA SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY ALSO LOWER OXIDATIVE STRESS AND BLOOD PRESSURE; ENHANCE PULMONARY AND AUTONOMIC FUNCTION, MOOD, SLEEP, AND QUALITY OF LIFE; AND REDUCE MEDICATION USE IN ADULTS WITH DM2. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING STUDIES, ADDITIONAL HIGH-QUALITY INVESTIGATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO CONFIRM AND FURTHER ELUCIDATE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA PROGRAMS IN POPULATIONS WITH DM2.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
5 2181  40 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING AND HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN OLDER ADULTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVE: THE GOAL WAS TO REVIEW SYSTEMATICALLY THE COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA, COMPARED WITH OTHER EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS, FOR OLDER ADULTS AS SHOWN ON MEASURES OF HEALTH AND PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING. DESIGN: THIS WAS A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WITH BOTH NARRATIVE SYNTHESIS AND META-ANALYSIS. DATA SOURCES: SEARCHES WERE CONDUCTED IN MEDLINE(R)/PUBMED, PSYCINFO, CINAHL, WEB OF SCIENCE, AND SCOPUS; BIBLIOGRAPHIES OF SELECTED ARTICLES; AND ONE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. METHODS: ORIGINAL STUDIES FROM 1950 TO NOVEMBER 2010 WERE SOUGHT, EVALUATING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON OLDER ADULTS. THE SEARCH WAS RESTRICTED TO RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS OF YOGA IN SUBJECTS >/=AGE 60, AND PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH. DATA WERE EXTRACTED AND EVALUATED REGARDING SETTING, POPULATION SIZE AND CHARACTERISTICS, INTERVENTION TYPE AND DURATION, COMPARISON GROUP, OUTCOME ASSESSMENT, DATA ANALYSIS, FOLLOW-UP, KEY RESULTS, AND THE QUALITY OF EACH STUDY ACCORDING TO SPECIFIC PREDETERMINED CRITERIA. RESULTS: THE SEARCH YIELDED 18 ELIGIBLE STUDIES (N=649). THE STUDIES REPORTED ON OLDER ADULTS ACROSS A RANGE OF SETTINGS, INTERVENTION INTENSITY, AND OUTCOME MEASURES. THE MAJORITY OF THE STUDIES HAD<35 PARTICIPANTS (RANGE 9-77). QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE SYNTHESIS OF THE STUDIES SUGGESTED THAT THE BENEFITS OF YOGA MAY EXCEED THOSE OF CONVENTIONAL EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS FOR SELF-RATED HEALTH STATUS, AEROBIC FITNESS, AND STRENGTH. HOWEVER, THE EFFECT SIZES WERE MODEST, AND THE EVIDENCE WAS MIXED FOR YOGA'S EFFECT ON DEPRESSION, SLEEP, AND BONE-MINERAL DENSITY. STUDIES DID NOT FIND AN EFFECT ON COGNITION. CONCLUSIONS: SMALL STUDIES WITH MIXED METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY SUGGESTED THAT YOGA MAY BE SUPERIOR TO CONVENTIONAL PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY INTERVENTIONS IN ELDERLY PEOPLE. THE PRECISION OF THE ESTIMATES REMAINS LOW. LARGER STUDIES ARE NECESSARY TO DEFINE BETTER THE INTERSECTION OF POPULATIONS, SETTINGS, AND INTERVENTIONS IN WHICH YOGA IS MOST BENEFICIAL.	2012	

6 2294  27 THERAPEUTIC EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR COMMON PRIMARY CARE CONDITIONS. INTRODUCTION: YOGA IS A POPULAR FORM OF EXERCISE THAT USES BODY POSTURES, MEDITATION, AND BREATHING TECHNIQUES AND HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE MANY HEALTH BENEFITS. OBJECTIVE/METHODS: OUR GOAL FOR THIS REVIEW IS TO ORIENT HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO THE EVIDENCE-BASED USES OF YOGA MOST RELEVANT TO PRIMARY CARE. WE CONDUCTED A PUBMED SEARCH THAT INCLUDED META-ANALYSES, REVIEWS, SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS, AND RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. RESULTS: RESULTS WERE LIMITED TO ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND PUBLICATION BETWEEN 2010 AND 2020. YOGA WAS FOUND TO HELP DECREASE HYPERTENSION, RELIEVE BACK PAIN, PROMOTE OVERALL WELL-BEING, AND IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA IS A RELATIVELY SAFE AND EFFECTIVE OPTION FOR PATIENTS INTERESTED IN THERAPEUTIC LIFESTYLE CHANGE TO PROMOTE WELL-BEING AND TO HELP MANAGE HYPERTENSION, BACK PAIN, AND OVERALL MENTAL HEALTH.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
7 2105  27 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON MENSTRUAL DISORDERS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVE: TO SUMMARIZE AND EVALUATE EVIDENCE FOR THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON MENSTRUAL DISORDERS. METHODS: PUBMED, CINAHL/MEDLINE, WEB OF SCIENCE, AMED, AND SCOPUS WERE SEARCHED FOR ENGLISH-LANGUAGE LITERATURE RELEVANT TO THE REVIEW QUESTION. ALL PRIMARY RESEARCH STUDIES WERE INCLUDED. RESULTS: FIFTEEN STUDIES DESCRIBED IN 18 PAPERS WERE INCLUDED IN THE REVIEW. A RANGE OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS WERE USED. SOME STUDIES USED A COMBINATION OF ASANA, PRANAYAMA, AND OTHER YOGIC RELAXATION OR MEDITATION TECHNIQUES. ALL INCLUDED STUDIES REPORTED SOME CHANGE IN THEIR OUTCOME MEASURES, SUGGESTING REDUCED SYMPTOMS OF MENSTRUAL DISTRESS FOLLOWING A YOGA INTERVENTION; HOWEVER, THE HETEROGENEITY AND INTENSITY OF THE INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOME MEASURES MEANT THAT FINDINGS HAVE LIMITED GENERALIZABILITY AND APPLICABILITY IN PRACTICE SETTINGS. CONCLUSIONS: FURTHER RESEARCH ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOGA PRACTICE AND MENSTRUAL DISORDERS IS WARRANTED, BUT THERE MUST BE BOTH CONSISTENCY IN THE METHODS, MEASURES, AND QUALITY OF STUDIES AND A SHIFT TOWARD RESEARCH ON YOGA PRACTICES THAT ARE REPLICABLE OUTSIDE OF THE CLINICAL TRIAL SETTING.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
8 2566  36 YOGA FOR DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IN PEOPLE WITH CANCER: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVE: CANCER AND ITS TREATMENT CAN LEAD TO A VARIETY OF PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL CONCERNS IMPACTING ON THOSE AFFECTED, INCLUDING SUBCLINICAL OR CLINICAL DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, WHICH IN TURN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON WELLBEING, QUALITY OF LIFE AND SURVIVAL. THE AIM OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ON SELF-REPORTED DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IN PEOPLE WITH CANCER IN RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. METHOD: SIX DATABASES WERE SEARCHED TO IDENTIFY RELEVANT STUDIES. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW PROCEDURES WERE FOLLOWED INCLUDING A QUALITY ASSESSMENT. META-ANALYSIS OF SUITABLE STUDIES WAS CONDUCTED. RESULTS: 26 STUDIES FROM OUR SEARCH CRITERIA WERE ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION FOR DEPRESSIVE AND 16 FOR ANXIETY SYMPTOMS. META-ANALYSES REVEALED EVIDENCE FOR SIGNIFICANT MEDIUM EFFECTS OF YOGA ON DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS (N = 1,486, G = -0.419, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI] = -0.558 TO -0.281, P < 0.001) AND ANXIETY (N = 977, G = -0.347, 95% CI = -0.473 TO -0.221, P < 0.001) COMPARED TO CONTROLS. SUBGROUP ANALYSES FOR DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS REVEALED SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS FOR ALL ANALYSES PERFORMED (TYPE OF CANCER, TYPE OF CONTROL, TREATMENT STATUS, DURATION OF INTERVENTION OR FREQUENCY OF YOGA SESSIONS), WITH EFFECT SIZES BEING COMPARABLE BETWEEN SUBGROUPS. SIMILAR FINDINGS WERE FOUND FOR ANXIETY SYMPTOMS EXCEPT FOR TREATMENT STATUS, WHERE THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT WAS FOUND WHEN YOGA WAS DELIVERED DURING ACTIVE TREATMENT. CONCLUSIONS: THIS REVIEW PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT IN PEOPLE WITH CANCER, YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH AMELIORATION OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND THEREFORE A PROMISING THERAPEUTIC MODALITY FOR THEIR MANAGEMENT. HOWEVER, THE POTENTIAL FOR RISK OF BIAS TOGETHER WITH CONTROL GROUP DESIGN CHALLENGES MEANS THE RESULTS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                    
9 2178  40 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PAIN, MOBILITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVE. TO SYSTEMATICALLY ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PAIN, MOBILITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS. METHODS. PUBMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE, THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS, PHYSIOTHERAPY EVIDENCE DATABASE (PEDRO), AND OTHER SOURCES WERE SEARCHED SYSTEMATICALLY IN THIS STUDY. TWO REVIEWERS IDENTIFIED ELIGIBLE STUDIES AND EXTRACTED DATA INDEPENDENTLY. DOWNS AND BLACK'S QUALITY INDEX WERE USED TO EVALUATE THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES. RESULTS. A TOTAL OF 9 ARTICLES (6 STUDIES) INVOLVING 372 PATIENTS WITH KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. THE MOST COMMON YOGA PROTOCOL IS 40~90 MINUTES/SESSION, LASTING FOR AT LEAST 8 WEEKS. THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON PAIN RELIEF AND FUNCTION IMPROVEMENT COULD BE SEEN AFTER TWO-WEEK INTERVENTION. CONCLUSION. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW SHOWED THAT YOGA MIGHT HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS IN RELIEVING PAIN AND MOBILITY ON PATIENTS WITH KOA, BUT THE EFFECTS ON QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) ARE UNCLEAR. BESIDES, MORE OUTCOME MEASURE RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH OF YOGA EFFECTS ON PEOPLE WITH KOA SHOULD BE CONDUCTED.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
10 2622  38 YOGA FOR SUBSTANCE USE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. INTRODUCTION: SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS (SUDS) ARE COMPLEX INTERACTIONS BETWEEN VARIOUS GENETIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, DEVELOPMENTAL, AND SOCIAL FACTORS. YOGA IS RECOMMENDED AS A NONMAINSTREAM TREATMENT FOR MANY HEALTH CONDITIONS, INCLUDING SUDS. METHODS: FIVE DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) THAT EVALUATED YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION IN ADULTS WITH ANY TYPE OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. THE INTERVENTIONS BEING STUDIED INCLUDED HATHA YOGA, SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA, BREATHING YOGA EXERCISES, AND MEDITATION. STUDIES, WHERE YOGA WAS COMBINED WITH OTHER INTERVENTIONS WERE EXCLUDED. THE EFFECT OF YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION WAS ANALYZED USING PRIMARY OUTCOMES SUCH AS ANXIETY, PAIN, AND CRAVING. EIGHT RCTS MET THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, AND QUALITY ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED USING THE COCHRANE CRITERIA. RESULTS: AMONG THE 8 FINAL STUDIES ELIGIBLE FOR QUALITY ANALYSIS, 2 HAD UNDEFINED SUBSTANCE USE, WHILE THE OTHERS WERE FOCUSED ON TOBACCO, ALCOHOL, OR OPIOIDS. SEVEN OUT OF 8 STUDIES SHOWED SIGNIFICANT RESULTS AND IMPROVED PRIMARY OUTCOMES SUCH AS ANXIETY, PAIN, OR SUBSTANCE USE. SEVEN OUT OF THE 8 STUDIES SHOWED SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE OUTCOMES USING YOGA IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT MODALITIES LIKE OPIOID SUBSTITUTION THERAPY. CONCLUSIONS: SIX OUT OF 8 STUDIES SHOWED LOW CONCERNS, WHILE 2 STUDIES SHOWED SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE RISK OF BIAS JUDGMENT. ALTHOUGH THE RESULTS LOOK ENCOURAGING, RCTS WITH LARGER SAMPLE SIZE ARE NEEDED TO BETTER EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AS A TREATMENT MODALITY FOR SUBSTANCE USE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
11 1109  35 EFFECTS OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ON COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN HEALTHY OLDER ADULTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. BACKGROUND: THE WORLD'S ELDERLY POPULATION IS GROWING. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY HAS POSITIVE EFFECTS ON HEALTH AND COGNITION, BUT IS DECREASING AMONG THE ELDERLY. INTEREST IN YOGA-BASED EXERCISES HAS INCREASED IN THIS POPULATION, ESPECIALLY AS AN INTERVENTION TARGETING BALANCE, FLEXIBILITY, STRENGTH, AND WELL-BEING. RECENT INTEREST HAS ARISEN REGARDING YOGA'S POTENTIAL BENEFITS FOR COGNITION. OBJECTIVE: TO SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEW EVIDENCE FROM RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ON COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING IN HEALTHY ADULTS AGED >/=60. A SECONDARY AIM WAS TO DESCRIBE INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS AND, WHERE POSSIBLE, THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE INFLUENCED STUDY OUTCOMES. METHOD: THE REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH PRISMA GUIDELINES. SEARCHES WERE PERFORMED FROM INCEPTION TO JUNE 2020 USING THE FOLLOWING ELECTRONIC DATABASES: (1) PUBMED (NLM); (2) EMBASE (ELSEVIER); (3) COCHRANE CENTRAL (WILEY); (4) PSYCINFO (EBSCOHOST); AND (5) CINAHL (EBSCOHOST). INCLUSION CRITERIA: RCTS OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ASSESSING COGNITION IN HEALTHY ADULTS >/=60 YEARS. RISK OF BIAS WAS ASSESSED USING THE REVISED COCHRANE RISK OF BIAS TOOL. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 1466 RECORDS WERE INITIALLY IDENTIFIED; SIX STUDIES (5 UNIQUE TRIALS) WERE INCLUDED IN THE REVIEW. FOUR OF THE SIX ARTICLES REPORTED SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ON COGNITION, INCLUDING GROSS MEMORY FUNCTIONING AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS. INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS AND ASSESSMENT METHODS VARIED BETWEEN STUDIES, WITH A HIGH OVERALL RISK OF BIAS IN ALL STUDIES. CONCLUSION: YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN COGNITION IN HEALTHY OLDER ADULTS. ADEQUATELY POWERED RCTS WITH ROBUST STUDY DESIGNS AND LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UPS ARE REQUIRED. FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD EXPLICITLY REPORT THE INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN COGNITIVE FUNCTION.	2021	
                                                                     
12  413  40 BLOOD PRESSURE RESPONSE TO MEDITATION AND YOGA: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVES: TO INTRODUCE RESEARCH THAT PRESENTS SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF MANTRA AND MINDFULNESS MEDITATION TECHNIQUES AND YOGA ON DECREASING BLOOD PRESSURE (BP) IN PATIENTS WHO HAVE HYPERTENSION. METHODS: A LITERATURE SEARCH WAS PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY ALL STUDIES PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1946 AND 2014 FROM PERIODICALS INDEXED IN OVID MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PSYCINFO, KOREAMED, AND NDSL BY USING THE FOLLOWING KEYWORDS: "HYPERTENSION," "BLOOD PRESSURE," "PSYCHOTHERAPY," "RELAXATION THERAPY," "MEDITATION," "YOGA," AND "MIND-BODY THERAPY." THE COCHRANE'S RISK OF BIAS WAS APPLIED TO ASSESS THE INTERNAL VALIDITY OF THE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL STUDIES. THIRTEEN STUDIES WERE ANALYZED IN THIS META-ANALYSIS BY USING REVIEW MANAGER 5.3. RESULTS: AMONG 510 POSSIBLE STUDIES, 13 MET THE SELECTION CRITERIA. SEVEN EXAMINED MEDITATION, AND SIX EXAMINED YOGA. THE META-ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT MEDITATION AND YOGA APPEARED TO DECREASE BOTH SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC BP, WHICH WERE WITHIN SIMILAR BASELINE RANGES, AND THE REDUCTION WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT; HOWEVER, SOME RESULTS SHOWED LITTLE DIFFERENCE. AFTER AN IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF THOSE RESULTS, BP RANGE AND PATIENT AGE WERE REVEALED AS THE FACTORS THAT AFFECTED THE DIFFERENT RESULTS IN SOME REPORTS. IN PARTICULAR, MEDITATION PLAYED A NOTICEABLE ROLE IN DECREASING THE BP OF SUBJECTS OLDER THAN 60 YEARS OF AGE, WHEREAS YOGA SEEMED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DECREASE OF SUBJECTS AGED LESS THAN 60 YEARS. CONCLUSIONS: WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS RESEARCH DUE TO THE DIFFERENCES IN BP AND THE PARTICIPANTS' AGES, MEDITATION AND YOGA ARE DEMONSTRATED TO BE EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVES TO PHARMACOTHERAPY. GIVEN THAT BP DECREASED WITH THE USE OF MEDITATION AND YOGA, AND THIS EFFECT VARIED IN DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS, SCIENTIFICALLY MEASURED OUTCOMES INDICATE THAT THESE PRACTICES ARE SAFE ALTERNATIVES IN SOME CASES.	2017	
                                                                                                                                           
13  590  43 DETERMINING THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA IN CHRONIC STROKE CARE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: SURVIVORS OF STROKE HAVE LONG-TERM PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES THAT IMPACT THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE. FEW INTERVENTIONS ARE AVAILABLE IN THE COMMUNITY TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS. YOGA, A TYPE OF MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTION, IS SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN PEOPLE WITH OTHER CHRONIC ILLNESSES AND MAY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE PROBLEMS REPORTED BY SURVIVORS OF STROKE. OBJECTIVES: TO DATE ONLY NARRATIVE REVIEWS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED. WE SOUGHT TO PERFORM, THE FIRST SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WITH META-ANALYSES OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) THAT INVESTIGATED YOGA FOR ITS POTENTIAL BENEFIT FOR CHRONIC SURVIVORS OF STROKE. METHODS: OVID MEDLINE, CINHAL PLUS, AMED, PUBMED, PSYCHINFO, PEDRO, COCHRANE DATABASE, SPORT DISCUSS, AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR WERE SEARCHED FOR PAPERS PUBLISHED BETWEEN JANUARY 1950 AND AUGUST 2016. REFERENCE LISTS OF INCLUDED PAPERS, REVIEW ARTICLES AND OPENGREY FOR GREY LITERATURE WERE ALSO SEARCHED. WE USED A MODIFIED COCHRANE TOOL TO EVALUATE RISK OF BIAS. THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF RCTS WAS ASSESSED USING THE GRADE APPROACH, RESULTS WERE COLLATED, AND RANDOM EFFECTS META-ANALYSES PERFORMED WHERE APPROPRIATE. RESULTS: THE SEARCH YIELDED FIVE ELIGIBLE PAPERS FROM FOUR RCTS WITH SMALL SAMPLE SIZES (N = 17-47). QUALITY OF RCTS WAS RATED AS LOW TO MODERATE. YOGA IS BENEFICIAL IN REDUCING STATE ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND DEPRESSION IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP (MEAN DIFFERENCES FOR STATE ANXIETY 6.05, 95% CI:-0.02 TO 12.12; P = 0.05 AND STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCES FOR DEPRESSION: 0.50, 95% CI:-0.01 TO 1.02; P = 0.05). CONSISTENT BUT NONSIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE DEMONSTRATED FOR BALANCE, TRAIT ANXIETY, AND OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA MAY BE EFFECTIVE FOR AMELIORATING SOME OF THE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES OF STROKE. LARGE WELL-DESIGNED RCTS ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE FINDINGS.	2017	
                                                                                                                       
14 2559  28 YOGA FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: A META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. OBJECTIVES: TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) USING A META-ANALYTICAL APPROACH. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) THAT EXAMINED PAIN ANDOR FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY AS TREATMENT OUTCOMES WERE INCLUDED. POST-TREATMENT AND FOLLOW-UP OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED. METHODS: A COMPREHENSIVE SEARCH OF RELEVANT ELECTRONIC DATABASES, FROM THE TIME OF THEIR INCEPTION UNTIL NOVEMBER 2011, WAS CONDUCTED. COHEN'S D EFFECT SIZES WERE CALCULATED AND ENTERED IN A RANDOM-EFFECTS MODEL. RESULTS: EIGHT RCTS MET THE CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION (EIGHT ASSESSING FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY AND FIVE ASSESSING PAIN) AND INVOLVED A TOTAL OF 743 PATIENTS. AT POST-TREATMENT, YOGA HAD A MEDIUM TO LARGE EFFECT ON FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY (D=0.645) AND PAIN (D=0.623). DESPITE A WIDE RANGE OF YOGA STYLES AND TREATMENT DURATIONS, HETEROGENEITY IN POST-TREATMENT EFFECT SIZES WAS LOW. FOLLOW-UP EFFECT SIZES FOR FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY AND PAIN WERE SMALLER, BUT REMAINED SIGNIFICANT (D=0.397 AND D=0.486, RESPECTIVELY); HOWEVER, THERE WAS A MODERATE TO HIGH LEVEL OF VARIABILITY IN THESE EFFECT SIZES. DISCUSSION: THE RESULTS OF THE PRESENT STUDY INDICATE THAT YOGA MAY BE AN EFFICACIOUS ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT FOR CLBP. THE STRONGEST AND MOST CONSISTENT EVIDENCE EMERGED FOR THE SHORT-TERM BENEFITS OF YOGA ON FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY. HOWEVER, BEFORE ANY DEFINITIVE CONCLUSIONS CAN BE DRAWN, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF METHODOLOGICAL CONCERNS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. IN PARTICULAR, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT FUTURE RCTS INCLUDE AN ACTIVE CONTROL GROUP TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOGA HAS SPECIFIC TREATMENT EFFECTS AND WHETHER YOGA OFFERS ANY ADVANTAGES OVER TRADITIONAL EXERCISE PROGRAMS AND OTHER ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES FOR CLBP.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
15  340  30 ARE THERE BENEFITS FROM TEACHING YOGA AT SCHOOLS? A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS. INTRODUCTION. YOGA IS A HOLISTIC SYSTEM OF VARIED MIND-BODY PRACTICES THAT CAN BE USED TO IMPROVE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH AND IT HAS BEEN UTILIZED IN A VARIETY OF CONTEXTS AND SITUATIONS. EDUCATORS AND SCHOOLS ARE LOOKING TO INCLUDE YOGA AS A COST-EFFECTIVE, EVIDENCE-BASED COMPONENT OF URGENTLY NEEDED WELLNESS PROGRAMS FOR THEIR STUDENTS. OBJECTIVES. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THIS STUDY WAS TO SYSTEMATICALLY EXAMINE THE AVAILABLE LITERATURE FOR YOGA INTERVENTIONS EXCLUSIVELY IN SCHOOL SETTINGS, EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ON ACADEMIC, COGNITIVE, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL BENEFITS. METHODS. AN EXTENSIVE SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED FOR STUDIES PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1980 AND OCTOBER 31, 2014 (PUBMED, PSYCINFO, EMBASE, ISI, AND THE COCHRANE LIBRARY). EFFECT SIZE ANALYSIS, THROUGH STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE AND HEDGES'G, ALLOWED FOR THE COMPARISON BETWEEN EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS. NINE RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS MET CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION IN THIS REVIEW. EFFECT SIZE WAS FOUND FOR MOOD INDICATORS, TENSION AND ANXIETY IN THE POMS SCALE, SELF-ESTEEM, AND MEMORY WHEN THE YOGA GROUPS WERE COMPARED TO CONTROL. FUTURE RESEARCH REQUIRES GREATER STANDARDIZATION AND SUITABILITY OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR CHILDREN.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
16 2573  34 YOGA FOR ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS THOUGHT TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR HEALTH CONDITIONS. THE ARTICLE AIMS TO ASSESS THE CURRENT CLINICAL EVIDENCE OF YOGA FOR ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION (EH). STRATEGY: MEDLINE, EMBASE, AND THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL) IN THE COCHRANE LIBRARY WERE SEARCHED UNTIL JUNE, 2013. WE INCLUDED RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS TESTING YOGA AGAINST CONVENTIONAL THERAPY, YOGA VERSUS NO TREATMENT, YOGA COMBINED WITH CONVENTIONAL THERAPY VERSUS CONVENTIONAL THERAPY OR CONVENTIONAL THERAPY COMBINED WITH BREATH AWARENESS. STUDY SELECTION, DATA EXTRACTION, QUALITY ASSESSMENT, AND DATA ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED ACCORDING TO THE COCHRANE STANDARDS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 6 STUDIES (INVOLVING 386 PATIENTS) WERE INCLUDED. THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF THE INCLUDED TRIALS WAS EVALUATED AS GENERALLY LOW. A TOTAL OF 6 RCTS MET ALL THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. 4 OF THEM COMPARED YOGA PLUS CONVENTIONAL THERAPY WITH CONVENTIONAL THERAPY. 1 RCT DESCRIBED YOGA COMBINED WITH CONVENTIONAL THERAPY VERSUS CONVENTIONAL THERAPY COMBINED WITH BREATH AWARENESS. 2 RCT TESTED THE EFFECT OF YOGA VERSUS CONVENTIONAL THERAPY ALONE. 1 RCT DESCRIBED YOGA COMPARED TO NO TREATMENT. ONLY ONE TRIAL REPORTED ADVERSE EVENTS WITHOUT DETAILS, THE SAFETY OF YOGA IS STILL UNCERTAIN. CONCLUSIONS: THERE IS SOME ENCOURAGING EVIDENCE OF YOGA FOR LOWERING SBP AND DBP. HOWEVER, DUE TO LOW METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF THESE IDENTIFIED TRIALS, A DEFINITE CONCLUSION ABOUT THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF YOGA ON EH CANNOT BE DRAWN FROM THIS REVIEW. THEREFORE, FURTHER THOROUGH INVESTIGATION, LARGE-SCALE, PROPER STUDY DESIGNED, RANDOMIZED TRIALS OF YOGA FOR HYPERTENSION WILL BE REQUIRED TO JUSTIFY THE EFFECTS REPORTED HERE.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
17 1108  28 EFFECTS OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ON CANCER-ASSOCIATED COGNITIVE DECLINE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: TO SUMMARIZE AND EVALUATE EVIDENCE AVAILABLE ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CANCER-ASSOCIATED COGNITIVE DECLINE (CACD). RECENT FINDINGS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED USING FOUR DATABASES OF ARTICLES PUBLISHED BEFORE JANUARY 1, 2020. TEN ARTICLES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA (SIX RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS, TWO SINGLE-ARM STUDIES, ONE NON-RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, AND ONE CASE SERIES STUDY). STUDIES WERE PREDOMINANTLY CONDUCTED WITH BREAST CANCER PATIENTS USING LOW-INTENSITY HATHA YOGA PROGRAMS. OF THE 10 ARTICLES, FIVE REPORTED SOME POSITIVE EFFECTS ON CACD, BUT SIGNIFICANT BIASES WERE POSSIBLE DUE TO DESIGN SHORTCOMINGS. COHEN'S D EFFECT SIZES RANGED FROM |0.03| TO |0.74|. THE EVIDENCE TO DATE IS INSUFFICIENT TO SUGGEST THAT YOGA IS BENEFICIAL FOR ATTENUATING CACD. MORE RIGOROUS TRIALS CONTROLLING FOR NON-SPECIFIC FACTORS ARE WARRANTED. THE FIELD WOULD ALSO BENEFIT FROM EXAMINING SELF-DELIVERED MODES OF YOGA FOR TREATING CACD IN VARIOUS CANCER POPULATIONS TO ENHANCE PRACTICE SUSTAINABILITY AND GENERALIZABILITY.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
18 1058  39 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON EATING DISORDERS-A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. BACKGROUND: THE QUESTION OF WHETHER YOGA PRACTICE AMELIORATES OR EVEN AGGRAVATES EATING DISORDERS IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEBATE. THE AIM OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO SYSTEMATICALLY ASSESS AND THE EFFECTIVENESS AND SAFETY OF YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH EATING DISORDERS. METHODS: MEDLINE/PUBMED, PSYCINFO, AND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE COLLECTION WERE SCREENED THROUGH JULY 2018 FOR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS, NON-RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS AND LONGITUDINAL OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES ON YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH EATING DISORDERS AND OTHER INDIVIDUALS WITH DISORDERED EATING AND/OR BODY DISSATISFACTION. RISK OF BIAS WAS ASSESSED USING THE COCHRANE RISK OF BIAS TOOL AND THE NEWCASTLE-OTTAWA QUALITY ASSESSMENT SCALE. RESULTS: EIGHT RANDOMIZED TRIALS AND FOUR UNCONTROLLED TRIALS INVOLVING A TOTAL OF 495 PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED. RISK OF BIAS WAS MIXED. COMPARING YOGA TO UNTREATED CONTROL GROUPS, EFFECT SIZES RANGED FROM NEGLIGIBLE EFFECTS OF D=0.02 TO VERY LARGE EFFECTS OF D=2.15. HOWEVER, MOST EFFECTS WERE SMALL TO MODERATELY SIZED AND IN MOST CASES NOT SIGNIFICANT. NO SAFETY-RELATED DATA WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS: THERE IS LIMITED EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTIVENESS AND SAFETY OF YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH EATING DISORDERS. YOGA CAN BE PRELIMINARILY CONSIDERED AS AN ADDITIONAL TREATMENT OPTION IN MULTIMODAL PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT PROGRAMS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
19  227  35 A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE EFFECT OF LAUGHTER YOGA ON PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES IN OLDER ADULTS. BACKGROUND: LAUGHTER YOGA IS ONE OF THE INCREASINGLY USED METHODS AMONG COMPLEMENTARY HEALTH APPROACHES IN THE WORLD. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LAUGHTER YOGA ON PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES IN OLDER ADULTS. METHODS: IN THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW, ELECTRONIC SEARCHES WERE PERFORMED IN CINAHL, WEB OF SCIENCE, COCHRANE, SCOPUS, PROQUEST DATABASES FROM MAY 2010 TO MAY 2020. THE SCREENING PROCESS WAS CONDUCTED BY TWO AUTHORS INDEPENDENTLY AND FINALLY AGREED TOGETHER. THE REVIEW WAS REPORTED ACCORDING TO PRISMA GUIDELINE. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 3210 STUDIES WERE EXAMINED, AND SEVEN PUBLICATIONS (SIX QUASI EXPERIMENTAL AND ONE RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL), IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INCLUSION CRITERIA WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY AND EVALUATED. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LAUGHTER YOGA ON PHYSICAL FUNCTION (BLOOD PRESSURE, CORTISOL LEVEL, SLEEP QUALITY) AND PSYCHOSOCIAL HEALTH (LIFE SATISFACTION, QUALITY OF LIFE, LONELINESS, DEATH ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, MOOD, HAPPINESS) IN OLDER ADULTS. CONCLUSION: LAUGHTER YOGA IS A COST-EFFECTIVE AND NO ADVERSE EFFECT IN OLDER ADULTS. IT CAN BE USED FOR HEALTH PROMOTION FOR OLDER ADULTS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
20 1043  32 EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON FATIGUE: A META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND. RESEARCHERS AIMED AT SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEWING AND META-ANALYZING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR FATIGUE. METHODS. PUBMED/MEDLINE WAS SEARCHED UNTIL JANUARY 2012 FOR CONTROLLED CLINICAL STUDIES. TWO REVIEWERS INDEPENDENTLY EXTRACTED THE DATA. THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF THE STUDIES WAS ASSESSED. A META-ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED. RESULTS. NINETEEN CLINICAL STUDIES (TOTAL N = 948) WERE INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW. INVESTIGATED YOGA STYLES INCLUDED HATHA, IYENGAR, ASANAS, PATANJALI, SAHAJA, AND TIBETAN YOGA. PARTICIPANTS WERE SUFFERING FROM CANCER, MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, DIALYSIS, CHRONIC PANCREATITIS, FIBROMYALGIA, ASTHMA, OR WERE HEALTHY. YOGA HAD A SMALL POSITIVE EFFECT ON FATIGUE (SMD = 0.27, 59% CI = 0.23-0.31). SEVEN STUDIES RECEIVED 4 POINTS ON THE JADAD SCORE. THERE WERE BASELINE DIFFERENCES IN AT LEAST 5 STUDIES. CONCLUSION. OVERALL, THE EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON FATIGUE WERE ONLY SMALL, PARTICULARLY IN CANCER PATIENTS. ALTHOUGH YOGA IS GENERALLY A SAFE THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION AND EFFECTIVE TO ATTENUATE OTHER HEALTH-RELATED SYMPTOMS, THIS META-ANALYSIS WAS NOT ABLE TO DEFINE THE POWERFUL EFFECT OF YOGA ON PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM FATIGUE. TREATMENT EFFECTS OF YOGA COULD BE IMPROVED IN WELL-DESIGNED FUTURE STUDIES. ACCORDING TO THE GRADE RECOMMENDATIONS ASSESSING THE OVERALL QUALITY OF EVIDENCE, THERE IS A MODERATE EFFECT OF THE CONFIDENCE PLACED IN THE ESTIMATES OF THE EFFECTS DISCUSSED HERE.	2012

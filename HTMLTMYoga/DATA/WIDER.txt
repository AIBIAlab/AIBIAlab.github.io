1 1671 130 NEW ENERGY GEOGRAPHIES: A CASE STUDY OF YOGA, MEDITATION AND HEALTHFULNESS. BEGINNING WITH A ROUTINE DAY IN THE LIFE OF A PRACTITIONER OF YOGA AND MEDITATION AND EMPHASISING THE IMPORTANCE OF NURTURING, MAINTAINING AND PREVENTING THE DISSIPATION OF DIVERSE 'ENERGIES', THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE POSSIBILITIES FOR GEOGRAPHICAL HEALTH STUDIES WHICH TAKE SERIOUSLY 'NEW ENERGY GEOGRAPHIES'. IT IS EXPLAINED HOW THIS ACCOUNT IS DERIVED FROM IN-DEPTH FIELDWORK TRACING HOW PRACTITIONERS OF YOGA AND MEDITATION FIND TIMES AND SPACES FOR THESE PRACTICES, OFTEN IN THE FACE OF BUSY URBAN LIFESTYLES. ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE 'ENERGY TALK' FEATURING HEAVILY IN HOW PRACTITIONERS DESCRIBE THE BENEFITS THAT THEY PERCEIVE THEMSELVES TO DERIVE FROM THESE PRACTICES, AND TO CLAIMS MADE ABOUT 'ENERGIES' GENERATED DURING THE TIME-SPACES OF THESE PRACTICES WHICH SEEMINGLY FLOW, USUALLY WITH POSITIVE EFFECTS, INTO OTHER DOMAINS OF THEIR LIVES. THE PAPER THEN DISCUSSES THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS ENERGY TALK IN THE CONTEXT OF: (A) CRITICALLY REVIEWING CONVENTIONAL APPROACHES TO STUDYING 'ENERGY GEOGRAPHIES'; (B) IDENTIFYING AN ALERTNESS TO THE LIKES OF 'AFFECTIVE ENERGIES' SURFACING IN RECENT THEORETICALLY-ATTUNED WORKS OF HUMAN GEOGRAPHY (AND COGNATE DISCIPLINES); AND (C) EXPLORING DIFFERING UNDERSTANDINGS OF ENERGY/ENERGIES EXTANT IN GEOGRAPHICAL STUDIES OF HEALTH AND IN STEP WITH THE EMPIRICAL RESEARCH MATERIALS PRESENTED ABOUT YOGA, MEDITATION AND HEALTHFULNESS. WHILE ORIENTATED TOWARDS EXPLICITLY GEOGRAPHICAL INQUIRIES, THE PAPER IS INTENDED AS A STATEMENT OF INTEREST TO THE WIDER MEDICAL HUMANITIES.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
2 1479  32 INTEGRATING BRAIN SCIENCE INTO HEALTH STUDIES: AN INTERDISCIPLINARY COURSE IN CONTEMPLATIVE NEUROSCIENCE AND YOGA. AS NEUROSCIENCE KNOWLEDGE GROWS IN ITS SCOPE OF SOCIETAL APPLICATIONS SO DOES THE NEED TO EDUCATE A WIDER AUDIENCE ON HOW TO CRITICALLY EVALUATE ITS RESEARCH FINDINGS. EFFORTS AT FINDING TEACHING APPROACHES THAT ARE INTERDISCIPLINARY, ACCESSIBLE AND HIGHLY APPLICABLE TO STUDENT EXPERIENCE ARE THUS ONGOING. THE ARTICLE DESCRIBES AN INTERDISCIPLINARY UNDERGRADUATE HEALTH COURSE THAT COMBINES THE ACADEMIC STUDY OF CONTEMPLATIVE NEUROSCIENCE WITH CONTEMPLATIVE PRACTICE, SPECIFICALLY YOGA. THE CLASS AIMS TO REACH A DIVERSE MIX OF STUDENTS BY TEACHING APPLICABLE, HEALTH-RELEVANT NEUROSCIENCE MATERIAL WHILE DIRECTLY CONNECTING IT TO FIRST-HAND EXPERIENCE. OUTCOMES INDICATE SUCCESS ON THESE GOALS: THE COURSE ATTRACTED A WIDE RANGE OF STUDENTS, INCLUDING NEARLY 50% NON-SCIENCE MAJORS. ON A PRE/POST TEST, STUDENTS SHOWED LARGE INCREASES IN THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF NEUROSCIENCE. STUDENTS' RATINGS OF THE COURSE OVERALL, OF INCREASES IN POSITIVE FEELINGS ABOUT ITS FIELD, AND OF THEIR PROGRESS ON SPECIFIC COURSE OBJECTIVES WERE HIGHLY POSITIVE. FINALLY, STUDENTS IN THEIR WRITTEN WORK APPLIED NEUROSCIENCE COURSE CONTENT TO THEIR PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL LIVES. SUCH RESULTS INDICATE THAT THIS APPROACH COULD SERVE AS A MODEL FOR THE INTERDISCIPLINARY, ACCESSIBLE AND APPLIED INTEGRATION OF RELEVANT NEUROSCIENCE MATERIAL INTO THE UNDERGRADUATE HEALTH CURRICULUM.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
3  421  22 BRIDGING BODY AND MIND: CONSIDERATIONS FOR TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA. INDIVIDUALS WHO SUFFER FROM TRAUMA-RELATED SYMPTOMS ARE A UNIQUE POPULATION THAT COULD BENEFIT FROM THE MIND-BODY PRACTICE OF YOGA-OR HAVE THEIR SYMPTOMS REACTIVATED BY IT, DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF YOGA. TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA (TIY), THAT IS, YOGA ADAPTED TO THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS WORKING TO OVERCOME TRAUMA, MAY AMELIORATE SYMPTOMS BY CREATING A SAFE, TAILORED PRACTICE FOR STUDENTS TO LEARN HOW TO RESPOND, RATHER THAN REACT, TO SYMPTOMS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. YOGA NOT THUS ADAPTED, ON THE OTHER HAND, MAY INCREASE REACTIVITY AND ACTIVATE SYMPTOMS SUCH AS HYPERAROUSAL OR DISSOCIATION. THIS ARTICLE REPORTS ON EXPERT INPUT ABOUT ADAPTING YOGA FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH TRAUMA, WITH SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR MILITARY POPULATIONS. ELEVEN EXPERTS, RECRUITED BASED ON LITERATURE REVIEW AND REFERRALS, WERE INTERVIEWED IN PERSON OR VIA TELEPHONE AND ASKED SEVEN QUESTIONS ABOUT TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA. VERBATIM TRANSCRIPTS WERE SUBJECTED TO OPEN-CODING THEMATIC ANALYSIS AND A PRIORI THEMES. FINDINGS REVEALED THAT TIY NEEDS TO EMPHASIZE BENEFICIAL PRACTICES (E.G., DIAPHRAGMATIC BREATH AND RESTORATIVE POSTURES), CONSIDER CONTRAINDICATIONS (E.G., AVOIDING SEQUENCES THAT OVERLY ENGAGE THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM), ADAPT TO LIMITATIONS AND CHALLENGES FOR TEACHING IN UNCONVENTIONAL SETTINGS (E.G., PRISONS, VA HOSPITALS), AND PROVIDE SPECIALIZED TRAINING AND PREPARATION (E.G., SPECIALIZED TIY CERTIFICATIONS, SELF-CARE OF INSTRUCTORS/THERAPISTS, ADAPTIONS FOR STUDENT NEEDS). TIY FOR VETERANS MUST ADDITIONALLY CONSIDER GENDER- AND CULTURE-RELATED BARRIERS, DIFFERING RELATIONSHIPS TO PAIN AND INJURY, AND MEDICATION AS A BARRIER TO PRACTICE.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
4  429  25 CAN YOGA MEET THE REQUIREMENT OF THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY GUIDELINE OF INDIA? A DESCRIPTIVE REVIEW. BACKGROUND: PHYSICAL INACTIVITY IS THE FOURTH MAJOR RISK FACTOR FOR GLOBAL MORTALITY ACCOUNTING FOR 6% OF ALL DEATHS GLOBALLY AND IT IS A KEY RISK FACTOR FOR NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASE OCCURRENCES. ABOUT 54.4% OF INDIANS ARE PHYSICALLY INACTIVE AND <10% ENGAGE IN RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES. ON THE ONE HAND, INDIA IS SPREADING THE MESSAGE OF YOGA, AS A FORM OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (PA) TO THE WHOLE WORLD. ON THE OTHER HAND, UNTIL NOW, THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY GUIDELINE (PAG) IN INDIA IS NOT YET FULLY DEVELOPED. THEREFORE, WE CONDUCTED A DESCRIPTIVE REVIEW OF THE RATIONALITY OF YOGA AS ONE OF THE PA TOOLS WITH TWO HYPOTHESES - DOES YOGA QUALIFY AS A PA TOOL? MOREOVER, CAN YOGA HELP TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT OF INDIAN PAG?. METHODS: AN IN-DEPTH LITERATURE REVIEW WAS CARRIED OUT USING DATABASES SUCH AS PUBMED, SCOPEMED, GOOGLE SCHOLAR, AND COCHRANE LIBRARY. ALL THE PUBLISHED ARTICLES, GOVERNMENT REPORTS AND POLICY DOCUMENTS, WHICH MET INCLUSION CRITERIA WITH SPECIFIC REFERENCE TO YOGA AND ENERGY EXPENDITURE, WERE GATHERED. RESULTS: THE SEARCH STRATEGY YIELDED 838 ARTICLES, OF WHICH 16 DOCUMENTS WERE CONSIDERED FOR REVIEW. THE REVIEW INCLUDED 7 POLICY DOCUMENTS AND/OR STUDIES THAT DISCUSSED PAGS/POLICY/STRATEGY GLOBALLY AND 9 RESEARCH STUDIES TARGETED TOWARD THE ENERGY EXPENDITURE AND YOGA. HUGE VARIABILITY WAS DOCUMENTED IN THE RECOMMENDED PAGS GLOBALLY AND YOGA FOUND TO BE THE MODERATE METABOLIC EQUIVALENTS OF TASKS IN THE FORM OF ENERGY EXPENDITURE IN THIS REVIEW. CONCLUSION: THE COMPENDIUM OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES SHOULD ADD A SEPARATE CATEGORY FOR ENERGY EXPENDITURE BY YOGA. THIS WILL HELP BUILD-UP NEWER EXERCISE FORMATS INVOLVING YOGIC PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES TO COMPLY WITH THE DAILY-RECOMMENDED PA DOSE. IN THE NATIONAL PA PLAN FOR INDIA, YOGA SHOULD GET A PROMINENT PLACE. FURTHER, IN THE INDIAN PERSPECTIVE, AN EXCLUSIVE PA PLAN IS JUSTIFIED INSTEAD OF A PA EMBEDDED WITHIN THE NATIONAL HEALTH PROGRAMS IN LIEU OF WIDER SCOPE.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
5 1872  15 RAPID CONVERSION OF A GROUP-BASED YOGA TRIAL FOR DIVERSE OLDER WOMEN TO HOME-BASED TELEHEALTH: LESSONS LEARNED USING ZOOM TO DELIVER MOVEMENT-BASED INTERVENTIONS. THIS BRIEF REPORT DESCRIBES THE RAPID CONVERSION OF A RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF A HATHA-BASED YOGA PROGRAM FOR OLDER WOMEN WITH URINARY INCONTINENCE TO A TELEHEALTH VIDEOCONFERENCE PLATFORM DURING THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) PANDEMIC. INTERIM RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF RECRUITING AND RETAINING PARTICIPANTS ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF AGES AND ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS, BUT ALSO POINT TO POTENTIAL OBSTACLES AND SAFETY CONCERNS ARISING FROM TELEHEALTH-BASED INSTRUCTION. THE INVESTIGATORS PRESENT LESSONS LEARNED ABOUT THE BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES OF USING TELEHEALTH PLATFORMS TO DELIVER MOVEMENT-BASED INTERVENTIONS AND CONSIDER STRATEGIES TO PROMOTE ACCESSIBLE AND WELL-TOLERATED TELEHEALTH-BASED YOGA PROGRAMS FOR OLDER AND DIVERSE POPULATIONS.

6 1911  21 ROLE OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE IN THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC - A NARRATIVE REVIEW. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS POSED AN IMMENSE CHALLENGE TO HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AROUND THE GLOBE IN TERMS OF LIMITED HEALTH CARE FACILITIES AND PROVEN MEDICAL THERAPEUTICS TO ADDRESS THE SYMPTOMS OF THE INFECTION. THE CURRENT HEALTH CARE STRATEGIES ARE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON EITHER THE PATHOGEN OR THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. HOWEVER, EFFORTS TOWARDS STRENGTHENING THE HOST IMMUNITY ARE IMPORTANT FROM PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF INFECTION AND DOWNREGULATE THE POTENCY OF THE INFECTIOUS AGENT. WHILE A VACCINE CAN INDUCE SPECIFIC IMMUNITY IN THE HOST, NON-SPECIFIC WAYS OF IMPROVING OVERALL HOST IMMUNITY ARE NEEDED AS WELL. THIS SCENARIO HAS PAVED THE WAY FOR THE USE OF TRADITIONAL INDIAN THERAPIES SUCH AS AYURVEDA AND YOGA. THIS REVIEW AIMS AT COLLATING AVAILABLE EVIDENCE ON AYURVEDA, YOGA, AND COVID-19. FURTHER, IT DRAWS INFERENCES FROM RECENT STUDIES ON YOGA AND AYURVEDA ON IMMUNITY, RESPIRATORY HEALTH, AND MENTAL HEALTH RESPECTIVELY TO APPROXIMATE ITS PROBABLE ROLE IN PROPHYLAXIS AND AS AN ADD-ON MANAGEMENT OPTION FOR THE CURRENT PANDEMIC.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
7 1294  24 GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPING YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR RANDOMIZED TRIALS. LITTLE GUIDANCE IS AVAILABLE TO ASSIST RESEARCHERS IN DEVELOPING TREATMENT PROTOCOLS FOR RESEARCH ON YOGA FOR HEALTH CONCERNS. BECAUSE YOGA IS A COMPLEX MULTIFACTORIAL MIND-BODY DISCIPLINE HISTORICALLY DEVELOPED FOR NONMEDICAL PURPOSES, NUMEROUS DECISIONS MUST BE MADE IN ORDER TO THOUGHTFULLY DEVELOP SUCH PROTOCOLS. IN THIS PAPER, A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH IS PROPOSED TO ASSIST RESEARCHERS IN SELECTING AN INTERVENTION THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE CONDITION UNDER CONSIDERATION AND EXPLICITLY DEVELOPED. RESEARCHERS NEED TO CONSIDER THE TYPE OR "STYLE" OF YOGA, THE COMPONENTS TO INCLUDE (E.G., BREATHING EXERCISES, POSTURES) AS WELL AS THE SPECIFIC PROTOCOL FOR EACH COMPONENT, THE DOSE TO BE DELIVERED (FREQUENCY, DURATION OF PRACTICE, AND THE TOTAL DURATION OF PRACTICE), AND ISSUES RELATED TO SELECTION OF INSTRUCTORS AND MONITORING THE FIDELITY TO THE INTERVENTION. EACH OF THESE DOMAINS AND THE KEY ISSUES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROTOCOLS IS DISCUSSED. FINALLY, SOME AREAS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH RELATED TO PROTOCOL DEVELOPMENT ARE RECOMMENDED.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
8 2807  23 YOGA THERAPY RESEARCH: A WHOLE-SYSTEMS PERSPECTIVE ON COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS AND PATIENT-CENTERED OUTCOMES. FOR THE YOGA RESEARCH COMMUNITY TO CAPITALIZE ON ITS CURRENT MOMENTUM, IT IS CRITICAL TO CONSIDER CERTAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESEARCH THEORY AND INNOVATIVE METHODOLOGIES. THE CONCEPT OF MODEL VALIDITY MUST BE INCORPORATED IN YOGA THERAPY RESEARCH SO THAT EXPLANATORY CONSTRUCTS EMPLOYED AND OUTCOME MEASURES CHOSEN REFLECT THE PRINCIPLES OF TRADITIONAL YOGIC SCIENCE. FOCUSING ON EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH WILL ENSURE MAXIMUM GENERALIZABILITY OF STUDY RESULTS AND REFLECT REAL-WORLD THERAPY DELIVERY SETTINGS, THEREBY INCREASING THE RELEVANCE OF OUTCOMES. WHOLE SYSTEMS OF HEALING REQUIRE RESEARCH METHODOLOGIES THAT ADDRESS COMPLEX RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MULTI-TARGET THERAPIES WITH MULTIPLE POTENTIAL TREATMENT RESULTS. COMPLEX, DYNAMIC SYSTEMS THEORY PROVIDES THE THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS NECESSARY TO DESIGN STUDIES, CHOOSE OUTCOMES, AND ANALYZE DATA IN A WAY THAT CAN ACCOUNT FOR CHARTING COMPLEX, CYCLICAL, THERAPEUTIC TRAJECTORIES ACROSS TIME. EMPHASIZING PATIENT-CENTERED OUTCOMES IS ALIGNED WITH THE PATENT-ORIENTED AND TAILORED NATURED OF YOGA THERAPY DELIVERY. INCREASING THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH TO ANALYZE THE HARMS AND BENEFITS OF CONTRASTING THERAPIES CAN PROVIDE AN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR DESIGNING STUDIES THAT CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT PRACTICAL IMPACT. THE CREATION OF PRACTICE-BASED RESEARCH NETWORKS WITHIN THE YOGA RESEARCH COMMUNITY WILL INCENTIVIZE LINKS BETWEEN MAINSTREAM CLINICAL RESEARCHERS AND YOGA THERAPY DELIVERY SETTINGS, ULTIMATELY DEVELOPING COLLABORATIVE NETWORKS. YOGA THERAPY CENTERS CAN FACILITATE PATIENT RECRUITMENT FOR STUDIES AND INFORM STANDARDS FOR YOGA RESEARCHERS. COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS BETWEEN THE YOGA AND AYURVEDIC RESEARCH COMMUNITIES WILL STREAMLINE EFFORTS, SOLIDIFY EXPERTISE, CROSS-POLLINATE THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL INNOVATION, AND CONSOLIDATE EFFORTS TO SECURE RESEARCH FUNDING AND INCREASE PUBLICATION AND DISSEMINATION OF STUDY FINDINGS.	2015

10 2795  25 YOGA THERAPY FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL AND VETERANS: QUALITATIVE PERSPECTIVES OF YOGA STUDENTS AND INSTRUCTORS. OBJECTIVE: MILLIONS OF MILITARY PERSONNEL AND VETERANS LIVE WITH CHRONIC MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH CONDITIONS THAT OFTEN DO NOT RESPOND WELL TO PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENTS. SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS AND LACK OF TREATMENT RESPONSE HAVE LED TO WIDESPREAD EFFORTS TO STUDY AND PROMOTE NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENTS FOR MANY CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS. YOGA IS AN INCREASINGLY POPULAR MIND-BODY INTERVENTION THAT HAS GROWING RESEARCH SUPPORT FOR ITS EFFICACY AND SAFETY. OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO EXPLORE THE ATTITUDES, PERSPECTIVES, AND PREFERENCES OF MILITARY PERSONNEL AND VETERANS TOWARD YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC MODALITY, THUS PROVIDING NEEDED INFORMATION FOR DESIGNING AND PROMOTING YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR THIS POPULATION. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED 24 INDIVIDUALS WITH YOGA EXPERIENCE AND CURRENT OR PAST MILITARY SERVICE AND 12 INSTRUCTORS WHO HAVE TAUGHT YOGA FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL AND/OR VETERANS. A SEMI-STRUCTURED SET OF QUESTIONS GUIDED INTERVIEWS WITH EACH PARTICIPANT. RESULTS: FIVE THEMES EMERGED FROM THE INTERVIEWS: (1) MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS EXPERIENCED FROM YOGA PRACTICE; (2) PHYSICAL HEALTH BENEFITS EXPERIENCED FROM YOGA PRACTICE; (3) IMPORTANT YOGA ELEMENTS AND CONDITIONS THAT SUPPORT EFFECTIVE PRACTICE; (4) FACILITATORS FOR ENGAGING MILITARY IN YOGA PRACTICE; AND (5) CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS TO YOGA PRACTICE FOR MILITARY. CONCLUSIONS: THE STUDY HIGHLIGHTS CONSISTENT REPORTS OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE, ONGOING STIGMA RESULTING IN THE NEED FOR COMBATTING AND DEMYSTIFYING YOGA AND OTHER COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH (CIH) PRACTICES, THE IMPORTANCE OF DESIGNING INTERVENTIONS TO ADDRESS THE UNIQUE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND PERSPECTIVES OF THIS POPULATION, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF EFFORTS BY MILITARY LEADERSHIP TO BRING CIH TO MILITARY PERSONNEL AND VETERANS. RIGOROUS RESEARCH ADDRESSING THESE FINDINGS, ALONG WITH FURTHER RESEARCH ON THE EFFICACY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR TREATING VARIOUS CONDITIONS ARE NEEDED.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
11 1895  20 RESILIENT TO PAIN: A MODEL OF HOW YOGA MAY DECREASE INTERFERENCE AMONG PEOPLE EXPERIENCING CHRONIC PAIN. CHRONIC MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DISABILITY GLOBALLY, YET FOR THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE CHRONIC PAIN, IT DOES NOT SERIOUSLY DISABLE THEM OR INTERFERE WITH THEIR LIFE. PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE SEVERE PAIN YET LOW DISABILITY DISPLAY A RESILIENT COURSE OF PAIN. YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO DECREASE DISABILITY AMONG PEOPLE WITH PAIN, BUT IT IS NOT KNOWN HOW. BECAUSE EVEN THE MOST BASIC YOGA PRACTICES POSSESS MANY OF THE COMPONENTS THOUGHT TO BE IMPORTANT IN FOSTERING RESILIENCE, YOGA IS A PROMISING MEANS OF IMPROVING RESILIENCE AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN. A VALIDATED CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF HOW THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRONIC PAIN IS AFFECTED BY YOGA IS NEEDED TO GUIDE A FUTURE RESEARCH AGENDA AND IDENTIFY POTENTIAL TARGETS FOR CHRONIC PAIN INTERVENTION. ULTIMATELY, AN EXPLANATORY MODEL COULD GUIDE THE OPTIMIZATION OF YOGA AND OTHER NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPIES FOR THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC PAIN. I PRESENT A TESTABLE MODEL.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
12 2369  27 WHAT ARE THE KNOWN EFFECTS OF YOGA ON THE BRAIN IN RELATION TO MOTOR PERFORMANCES, BODY AWARENESS AND PAIN? A NARRATIVE REVIEW. OBJECTIVE: THE CURRENT BODY OF LITERATURE WAS REVIEWED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON THE BRAIN IN RELATION TO MOTOR PERFORMANCE, BODY AWARENESS AND PAIN. BACKGROUND: YOGA HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY POPULAR IN THE WESTERN COUNTRIES ESPECIALLY FOR ITS UNIQUE INTEGRATION OF THE MIND AND BODY. YOGA HAS BEEN STUDIED MORE INTENSELY IN THE LAST DECADE. ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS, FEW STUDIES HAVE LOOKED INTO THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON IMPROVING MOTOR PERFORMANCE, BODY AWARENESS OR PAIN AND THE POSSIBLE UNDERLYING BRAIN MECHANISMS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. METHODS: A SEARCH OF THE CURRENT LITERATURE WAS MADE USING KEYWORDS SUCH AS: "YOGA BRAIN MOTOR", "YOGA BRAIN PAIN", "EFFECTS YOGA BRAIN" AND "EFFECTS YOGA BRAIN MOTOR PERFORMANCE". THE FINDINGS WERE THEN DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO MOTOR PERFORMANCE, BODY AWARENESS AND PAIN AND THEIR REPORTED MECHANISMS OF ACTION ON THE BRAIN. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 61 ARTICLES WERE SELECTED, OUT OF WHICH 29 WERE EXCLUDED BECAUSE THEY DID NOT MEET OUR CRITERIA. A TOTAL OF THIRTY-TWO ARTICLES WERE INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW, WHICH WE FURTHER SUBDIVIDED BY FOCUS: MOTOR PERFORMANCE (N=10), BODY AWARENESS (N=14) AND PAIN (N=8). DISCUSSION: OUR REVIEW SHOWS THAT YOGA HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON LEARNING RATE, SPEED AND ACCURACY OF A MOTOR TASK BY INCREASING ATTENTION AND DECREASING STRESS THROUGH A BETTER CONTROL OF SENSORIMOTOR RHYTHMS. YOGA ALSO SEEMS TO IMPROVE SENSORY AWARENESS AND INTEROCEPTION, REGULATE AUTONOMIC INPUT, INCREASE PARASYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY AND PROMOTE SELF-REGULATION. YOGA WAS ALSO SHOWN TO REDUCE THE THREAT SIGNAL, INCREASE PAIN TOLERANCE, DECREASE PAIN UNPLEASANTNESS AND DECREASE THE ANXIETY AND DISTRESS ASSOCIATED WITH PAIN. THOSE CHANGES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE RECRUITMENT OF SPECIFIC BRAIN AREAS SUCH AS THE INSULA, THE AMYGDALA AND THE HIPPOCAMPUS. CONCLUSION: BASED ON THE STUDIES REVIEWED IN THIS REPORT, WE FOUND THAT THE PRACTICE OF YOGA SEEMS TO FACILITATE MOTOR LEARNING, TO INCREASE BODY AWARENESS AND TO DECREASE PAIN. THESE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF CHANGES IN TERMS OF BRAIN ACTIVITY AND STRUCTURE. FURTHER STUDIES ARE NECESSARY TO REVEAL ITS PRECISE MECHANISM OF ACTION ON THE BRAIN AND TO VALIDATE ITS WIDER APPLICATION IN CLINICAL SETTINGS.	2019	

13 2032  23 TAILORING TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA FOR HIGH-RISK POPULATIONS IN PUBLIC-SECTOR SETTINGS. LOW-INCOME, RACIAL-MINORITY, HIGH-RISK POPULATIONS HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENTS FOR POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD), AND THEIR ACCEPTANCE OF COMPLEMENTARY INTERVENTIONS IS UNKNOWN. TRAUMA CENTER TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA (TC-TSY), WHICH HAS DEMONSTRATED EFFICACY IN COMMUNITY SAMPLES, HAS NOT YET BEEN WIDELY USED WITH ETHNIC MINORITY LOW-INCOME INDIVIDUALS. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A CULTURALLY TAILORED VERSION OF A TC-TSY INTERVENTION DELIVERED AS A DROP-IN SERVICE IN A PUBLIC HOSPITAL-BASED CLINIC TO PATIENTS WITH HISTORIES OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE AND SUICIDE ATTEMPTS. TC-TSY WAS ITERATIVELY TAILORED TO MEET THE UNIQUE CLINICAL NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THIS SETTING. GROUP FACILITATOR OBSERVATIONS ARE SUMMARIZED; THEY DESCRIBE A SUCCESSFUL INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION AND CULTURALLY INFORMED ADAPTATION OF THE GROUP INTERVENTION. THE FACILITATORS' OBSERVATIONS ILLUSTRATED THAT GROUP MEMBERS ACCEPTED THE INTEGRATION OF THIS STRUCTURED, GENTLE YOGA PRACTICE INTO OUTPATIENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAMMING AND IDENTIFIED SITE-SPECIFIC MODIFICATIONS TO INFORM FORMAL STUDY. THE PROCESS BY WHICH TC-TSY WAS ADAPTED AND IMPLEMENTED FOR BLACK INDIVIDUALS WITH A HISTORY OF INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA AT RISK FOR SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR CAN SERVE AS A GUIDE FOR TAILORING OTHER COMPLEMENTARY, INTEGRATIVE INTERVENTIONS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF UNIQUE CLINICAL SETTINGS. THIS PROCESS IS OFFERED AS A FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE SYSTEMATIC TESTING OF THIS COMPLEMENTARY, INTEGRATED, CULTURALLY ADAPTED TRAUMA THERAPY IN HIGH-RISK CLINICAL POPULATIONS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
14   93  27 A NARRATIVE REVIEW OF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS AS COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES FOR ADDICTION. THIS PAPER REVIEWS THE PHILOSOPHICAL ORIGINS, CURRENT SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE, AND CLINICAL PROMISE OF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS AS COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES FOR ADDICTION. HISTORICALLY, THERE ARE EIGHT ELEMENTS OF YOGA THAT, TOGETHER, COMPRISE ETHICAL PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES FOR LIVING A MEANINGFUL, PURPOSEFUL, MORAL AND SELF-DISCIPLINED LIFE. TRADITIONAL YOGA PRACTICES, INCLUDING POSTURES AND MEDITATION, DIRECT ATTENTION TOWARD ONE'S HEALTH, WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THE SPIRITUAL ASPECTS OF ONE'S NATURE. MINDFULNESS DERIVES FROM ANCIENT BUDDHIST PHILOSOPHY, AND MINDFULNESS MEDITATION PRACTICES, SUCH AS GENTLE HATHA YOGA AND MINDFUL BREATHING, ARE INCREASINGLY INTEGRATED INTO SECULAR HEALTH CARE SETTINGS. CURRENT THEORETICAL MODELS SUGGEST THAT THE SKILLS, INSIGHTS, AND SELF-AWARENESS LEARNED THROUGH YOGA AND MINDFULNESS PRACTICE CAN TARGET MULTIPLE PSYCHOLOGICAL, NEURAL, PHYSIOLOGICAL, AND BEHAVIORAL PROCESSES IMPLICATED IN ADDICTION AND RELAPSE. A SMALL BUT GROWING NUMBER OF WELL-DESIGNED CLINICAL TRIALS AND EXPERIMENTAL LABORATORY STUDIES ON SMOKING, ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE, AND ILLICIT SUBSTANCE USE SUPPORT THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS AND HYPOTHESIZED MECHANISMS OF ACTION UNDERLYING MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR TREATING ADDICTION. BECAUSE VERY FEW STUDIES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED ON THE SPECIFIC ROLE OF YOGA IN TREATING OR PREVENTING ADDICTION, WE PROPOSE A CONCEPTUAL MODEL TO INFORM FUTURE STUDIES ON OUTCOMES AND POSSIBLE MECHANISMS. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS ALSO NEEDED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT TYPES OF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS WORK BEST FOR WHAT TYPES OF ADDICTION, WHAT TYPES OF PATIENTS, AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. OVERALL, CURRENT FINDINGS INCREASINGLY SUPPORT YOGA AND MINDFULNESS AS PROMISING COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES FOR TREATING AND PREVENTING ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
15  376  19 BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO YOGA USE IN A POPULATION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH SELF-REPORTED CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: A QUALITATIVE APPROACH. YOGA HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE EFFICACIOUS IN TREATING CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN, YET BIOMEDICAL TREATMENTS ARE MOST COMMONLY USED FOR PAIN. PROMOTING YOGA AS PART OF INTEGRATIVE CARE WOULD REDUCE EXCLUSIVE RELIANCE ON HIGH-COST, HIGHER-RISK BIOMEDICAL TREATMENTS. ATTITUDES TOWARD YOGA PLAY A ROLE IN CONSIDERATION OF IT AS A TREATMENT. THE CURRENT STUDY EXAMINED ATTITUDES TOWARD YOGA IN ADULTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN AND COMPARED THESE RESULTS TO THOSE FOUND IN A 2009 GENERAL POPULATION STUDY. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED A SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW WHERE THEY RESPONDED TO ITEMS ABOUT PERCEPTIONS OF POTENTIAL BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO TRYING YOGA. PARTICIPANT RESPONSES WERE ANALYZED QUALITATIVELY AND SEVERAL COMMON THEMES EMERGED. THEMES IDENTIFIED BY PARTICIPANTS INDICATED THERE IS MIXED INFORMATION ABOUT YOGA IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN AND THAT CLARIFICATION OF WHAT YOGA IS, HOW IT CAN BE BENEFICIAL, AND WHAT IT REQUIRES ONE TO DO PHYSICALLY MAY HELP PROMOTE ITS USE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
16 2042  23 THE 'WORLD OF YOGA': THE PRODUCTION AND REPRODUCTION OF THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPES. YOGA IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE FASHIONABLE ALL AROUND THE WORLD. THIS ACTIVITY, PARTLY CONSIDERED AS THERAPEUTIC, REVEALS CONTEMPORARY WAYS OF PRODUCING GLOBAL PRACTICES. VIA A QUESTIONNAIRE COMPLETED BY INDIVIDUALS AT YOGA CENTRES IN INDIA AND FRANCE, THE PAPER ANALYSES THIS PHENOMENON USING THE CONCEPT OF THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPES. FURTHERMORE, IT EXAMINES HOW THESE THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPES ARE INFLUENCED BY GLOBALISATION. BRINGING TOGETHER THE CONCEPTS OF THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPES, GLOBALISATION AND THE PRACTICE OF YOGA, THE PAPER ANALYSES THE PRODUCTION AND REPRODUCTION OF YOGIC THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPES IN THE WORLD'S SPACE. CONSTITUTED OF NATURAL PHYSICAL ELEMENTS AND BUILT STRUCTURES, THESE THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPES ARE ALSO STRONGLY LINKED TO EMOTIONAL QUALITIES AND INTIMATE FEELINGS EVOKED BY THE PLACE AND RELATED TO HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. THE PAPER ALSO UNDERLINES THAT THE EMERGENCE OF INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNISED THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPES DEMANDS A CULTURAL AND SOCIAL GEOGRAPHICAL APPROACH THAT COULD HELP TO EXAMINE THE REPERCUSSIONS OF LOCAL AND GLOBAL PHENOMENA ON THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPES. INDEED, VERY OFTEN, YOGIS, ALL AROUND THE WORLD, REFER TO IDEAL PLACES WHERE THEY RARELY GO. CONSEQUENTLY, THEY CREATE AN IMAGINED THERAPEUTIC ENVIRONMENT THAT THE PAPER DESCRIBES.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
17 2211  31 THE HEALTH IMAGINARY OF POSTURAL YOGA. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE CAPACITY OF YOGA NARRATIVES AND PRACTICES TO CONTRIBUTE TO AND RELATE IDEAS ABOUT HEALTH. IT ADDS THEORETICALLY TO EXISTING LITERATURE ON YOGA BY INTRODUCING THE CONCEPT OF THE 'HEALTH IMAGINARY' AS AN ANALYTIC LENS FOR CONSIDERING YOGA DISCOURSES IN LATE MODERN TIMES, WHERE PERSONAL HEALTH CARE AND SPIRITUAL AMBITIONS ARE ONCE AGAIN BECOMING BLURRED. WITH THIS PERSPECTIVE, THE PAPER PROVIDES A THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF HOW YOGA POSTURES (ASANAS) ARE CONCEIVED TO WORK THERAPEUTICALLY, IN YOGA'S RECENT HISTORY AND IN PRESENT-DAY YOGA THERAPY. TAKING CASE STUDIES FROM INDIA AND GERMANY, IT IS SHOWN EMPIRICALLY HOW THE APPLICATION OF ASANAS IS RATIONALIZED DIFFERENTLY IN SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHICAL AND THERAPEUTIC ENVIRONMENTS - PARTICULARLY REGARDING THE PRESUMED THEORY OF THE BODY. THUS, THE CONCEPT OF THE HEALTH IMAGINARY NOT ONLY PROVIDES ANALYTIC SPACE TO EXPLORE THE IMPLICIT LOGICS AND GOALS OF HEALING IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS, BUT ALSO OFFERS CLUES ABOUT THE DISTINCT SOCIAL, CULTURAL/RELIGIOUS, AND LOCAL INFLUENCES THAT DRAW PEOPLE INTO YOGA AND CONTRIBUTE TO ITS SELECTIVE APPROPRIATION ACROSS THE GLOBE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
18 2773  25 YOGA RESEARCH AND SPIRITUALITY: A CASE STUDY DISCUSSION. THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE THAT YOGA CAN BE BENEFICIAL AS AN ASPECT OF SELF-CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH ARTHRITIS. HOWEVER, YOGA MAY BE LESS ACCEPTABLE TO THOSE FROM DIFFERENT CULTURES, SOCIOECONOMIC BACKGROUNDS, AND RACIAL/ETHNIC IDENTITIES. WHILE IMPLEMENTING A FEASIBILITY/ACCEPTABILITY PILOT STUDY OF YOGA AS SELF-CARE IN MINORITY COMMUNITIES, THE SUBJECT OF SPIRITUALITY SURFACED. THIS COMMENTARY SHARES THE EXPERIENCE OF THE RESEARCHERS AND YOGA TEACHERS COLLABORATING ON THE STUDY AND THE LARGER CONVERSATION THAT ENSUED FOLLOWING THE WITHDRAWAL OF ONE OF THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS. IT IS AN ATTEMPT TO START A RELEVANT AND NEEDED DIALOGUE AROUND YOGA RESEARCH AS AN INTEGRATIVE HEALTH MODALITY, AND WHY THE UNDERLYING BODY-MIND-SPIRIT APPROACH TO YOGA MAY SOMETIMES SERVE AS A BARRIER TO PARTICIPATION FOR DIVERSE POPULATIONS SUFFERING FROM ARTHRITIS.	2015

THE THEORETICAL UNDERSTANDING OF THIS BENEFIT HAS PREVIOUSLY FOCUSED ON PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES INVOLVED IN YOGA PRACTICE, HOWEVER INTEREST HAS TURNED TO THE POTENTIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL MECHANISMS ELICITING PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING. THE CURRENT PAPER BUILDS ON PREVIOUS THEORY AND ARGUES THAT YOGA PRACTICE TARGETS TRANSDIAGNOSTIC PSYCHOLOGICAL PROCESSES; MECHANISMS THAT FEATURE COMMONLY ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF PRESENTATIONS, THUS REDUCING DISTRESS AND INCREASING WELLBEING ACROSS CLINICAL AND NON-CLINICAL POPULATIONS. FEATURES OF YOGA PRACTICE ARE DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO THESE TRANSDIAGNOSTIC PROCESSES AND THE FEATURES OF MODERN TALKING THERAPIES. A NEW MODEL IS PROPOSED POSITING SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF YOGA PRACTICE CORRELATE WITH SPECIFIC TRANSDIAGNOSTIC PROCESSES TO ELICIT PSYCHOLOGICAL CHANGE AND ARGUES THAT THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH CHANGE OCCURS ARE DIRECTLY COMPARED WITH THE CHANGES OBSERVED IN TALKING THERAPIES. THE IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH AND THE POTENTIAL FOR THIS TO SUPPORT THE COMMISSIONING OF HOLISTIC APPROACHES IN CLINICAL PRACTICE ARE DISCUSSED.	2022

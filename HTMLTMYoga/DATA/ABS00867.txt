1  867 190 EFFECT OF YOGA REGIMEN ON LUNG FUNCTIONS INCLUDING DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE PATIENTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. BACKGROUND: LUNG FUNCTIONS ARE FOUND TO BE IMPAIRED IN CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD), CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE, LEFT VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION, AND AFTER CARDIAC SURGERY. DIFFUSION CAPACITY PROGRESSIVELY WORSENS AS THE SEVERITY OF CAD INCREASES DUE TO REDUCTION IN LUNG TISSUE PARTICIPATING IN GAS EXCHANGE. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISES AND YOGIC POSTURES MAY PLAY AN IMPRESSIVE ROLE IN IMPROVING CARDIO-RESPIRATORY EFFICIENCY AND FACILITATING GAS DIFFUSION AT THE ALVEOLO-CAPILLARY MEMBRANE. THIS STUDY WAS DONE TO SEE THE EFFECT OF YOGA REGIMEN ON LUNG FUNCTIONS PARTICULARLY DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN CAD PATIENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 80 STABLE CAD PATIENTS BELOW 65 YEARS OF AGE OF BOTH SEXES WERE SELECTED AND RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS OF 40 EACH. GROUP I CAD PATIENTS WERE GIVEN YOGA REGIMEN FOR 3 MONTHS WHICH CONSISTED OF YOGIC POSTURES, PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISES, DIETARY MODIFICATION, AND HOLISTIC TEACHING ALONG WITH THEIR CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE WHILE GROUP II CAD PATIENTS WERE PUT ONLY ON CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE. LUNG FUNCTIONS INCLUDING DIFFUSION CAPACITY WERE RECORDED THRICE IN BOTH THE GROUPS: 0 DAY AS BASELINE, 22(ND) DAY AND ON 90(TH) DAY BY USING COMPUTERIZED MS MEDISOFT CARDIO-RESPIRATORY INSTRUMENT, HYP'AIR COMPACT MODEL OF CARDIO-RESPIRATORY TESTING MACHINE WAS MANUFACTURED BY P K MORGAN, INDIA. THE RECORDED PARAMETERS WERE STATISTICALLY ANALYZED BY REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA FOLLOWED BY TUKEY'S TEST IN BOTH THE GROUPS. CARDIOVASCULAR PARAMETERS WERE ALSO COMPARED BEFORE AND AFTER INTERVENTION IN BOTH THE GROUPS. RESULTS: STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE SEEN IN SLOW VITAL CAPACITY, FORCED VITAL CAPACITY, PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE, MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION, AND DIFFUSION FACTOR/ TRANSFER FACTOR OF LUNG FOR CARBON MONOXIDE AFTER 3 MONTHS OF YOGA REGIMEN IN GROUP I. FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1(ST) SEC (FEV1), AND FEV1 % ALSO SHOWED A TREND TOWARD IMPROVEMENT ALTHOUGH NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. HR, SBP AND DBP ALSO SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN GROUP-I PATIENTS WHO FOLLOWED YOGA REGIMEN. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA REGIMEN WAS FOUND TO IMPROVE LUNG FUNCTIONS AND DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN CAD PATIENTS BESIDES IMPROVING CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTIONS. THUS, IT CAN BE USED AS A COMPLIMENTARY OR ADJUNCT THERAPY ALONG WITH THE CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE FOR THEIR TREATMENT AND REHABILITATION.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
2  865  70 EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICES ON PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS INCLUDING TRANSFER FACTOR OF LUNG FOR CARBON MONOXIDE (TLCO) IN ASTHMA PATIENTS. PRANA IS THE ENERGY, WHEN THE SELF-ENERGIZING FORCE EMBRACES THE BODY WITH EXTENSION AND EXPANSION AND CONTROL, IT IS PRANAYAMA. IT MAY AFFECT THE MILIEU AT THE BRONCHIOLES AND THE ALVEOLI PARTICULARLY AT THE ALVEOLO-CAPILLARY MEMBRANE TO FACILITATE DIFFUSION AND TRANSPORT OF GASES. IT MAY ALSO INCREASE OXYGENATION AT TISSUE LEVEL. AIM OF OUR STUDY IS TO COMPARE PULMONARY FUNCTIONS AND DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN PATIENTS OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA BEFORE AND AFTER YOGIC INTERVENTION OF 2 MONTHS. SIXTY STABLE ASTHMATIC-PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS I.E GROUP 1 (YOGA TRAINING GROUP) AND GROUP 2 (CONTROL GROUP). EACH GROUP INCLUDED THIRTY PATIENTS. LUNG FUNCTIONS WERE RECORDED ON ALL PATIENTS AT BASELINE, AND THEN AFTER TWO MONTHS. GROUP 1 SUBJECTS SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT (P<0.001) IN TRANSFER FACTOR OF THE LUNG FOR CARBON MONOXIDE (TLCO), FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1ST SEC (FEV1), PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR), MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION (MVV) AND SLOW VITAL CAPACITY (SVC) AFTER YOGA PRACTICE. QUALITY OF LIFE ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT PRANAYAMA & YOGA BREATHING AND STRETCHING POSTURES ARE USED TO INCREASE RESPIRATORY STAMINA, RELAX THE CHEST MUSCLES, EXPAND THE LUNGS, RAISE ENERGY LEVELS, AND CALM THE BODY.	2012

4 2006  73 STUDY OF THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE PATIENTS: A CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: PATIENTS OF CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD) ARE AT HIGH RISK FOR DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY. YOGA TECHNIQUES ARE SUITED FOR PROMOTING RELAXATION, PSYCHO-EMOTIONAL STABILITY AND EXERCISE TOLERANCE. STUDIES SHOWING THE EFFECT OF YOGA IN DIFFUSION CAPACITY ARE NOT AVAILABLE; HENCE THIS STUDY WAS PLANNED. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON 60 DIAGNOSED STABLE MILD-TO-MODERATE COPD PATIENTS IN THE AGE GROUP OF 30-60 YEARS, OF EITHER SEX, IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSIOLOGY. PATIENTS WERE TAKEN FROM GURU TEG BAHADUR HOSPITAL, DELHI AND DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: CONTROL AND THE YOGA GROUP. BOTH THE GROUPS WERE ON CONVENTIONAL DRUG THERAPY. SUBJECTS FROM THE YOGA GROUP WAS CALLED TO CARDIOPULMONARY LABORATORY DAILY FOR 21 DAYS AND THEN WEEKLY FOR THE COMPLIANCE. YOGA INSTRUCTOR TAUGHT THEM THE TECHNIQUE OF PRANAYAMA AND VARIOUS POSTURES EVERY DAY. THEY PRACTICED YOGA AT HOME FOR 2 MONTHS FOR 45 MIN IN THE MORNINGS. DIFFUSION CAPACITY WAS RECORDED BY USING COMPUTERIZED MEDISOFT INSTRUMENT (HYPAIR COMPACT), IN BOTH THE GROUPS BEFORE AND AFTER 2 MONTHS. RESULTS: STATISTICAL ANALYSIS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN TLCO OF THE YOGA GROUP. TRANSFER FACTOR OF LUNG FOR CARBON MONOXIDE I.E. TLCO IN MILD COPD INCREASED FROM 17.61 +/- 4.55 TO 19.08 +/- 5.09 ML/MMHG/MIN, AND IN MODERATE COPD IT INCREASED FROM 14.99 +/- 4.02 TO17.35 +/- 3.97 ML/MMHG/MIN. CONCLUSION: IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT YOGIC BREATHING EXERCISES IMPROVE DIFFUSION CAPACITY. THEY ARE BENEFICIAL TO COPD PATIENTS AND THEY CAN BE USED AS AN ADJUNCT THERAPY WITH THE CONVENTIONAL MEDICAL THERAPY.	2012

6 2786  59 YOGA THERAPY AS AN ADJUVANT IN MANAGEMENT OF ASTHMA. OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON CONTROL OF ASTHMA IN CHILDREN WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA. METHODS: THIS HOSPITAL-BASED INTERVENTIONAL RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL CONDUCTED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PEDIATRICS AT A TERTIARY CARE CENTER OF NORTH INDIA FROM NOVEMBER 2017 TO OCTOBER 2018 ENROLLED 140 NEWLY DIAGNOSED CASES OF ASTHMA OF AGE 10-16 Y WHO WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS. SEVENTY CHILDREN IN THE CASE GROUP PRACTICED YOGA UNDER SUPERVISION FOR A PERIOD OF 3 MO IN ADDITION TO PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT. SEVENTY CONTROLS RECEIVED ONLY PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT. PULMONARY-FUNCTION TESTS WERE DONE AT BASELINE, 6 WK, AND 12 WK ALONG WITH QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) ASSESSMENT BY PEDIATRIC ASTHMA QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE (PAQLQ). THE OUTCOME MEASURES ASSESSED WERE FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN ONE SECOND (FEV1), FEV1/FVC AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR). QOL EVALUATION WAS DONE IN 3 DOMAINS: ACTIVITY LIMITATION, SYMPTOMS, AND EMOTIONAL FUNCTION. RESULTS: THE ASTHMATIC CHILDREN PRACTICING YOGA HAVE SHOWN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC AND PEFR WHICH WAS BETTER AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS. IMPROVEMENT WAS ALSO NOTED IN MEAN-PAQLQ SCORE IN CASES WHICH WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS. CONCLUSION: YOGA APPEARS TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECT ON CONTROL OF ASTHMA MEASURED BY PULMONARY-FUNCTION TEST AND QOL. THEREFORE YOGA THERAPY CAN BE RECOMMENDED AS AN ADJUVANT IN MANAGEMENT OF ASTHMA ALONG WITH STANDARD PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
7  777  69 EFFECT OF YOGA AND PHYSIOTHERAPY ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN CHILDREN WITH DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY - A COMPARATIVE STUDY. CONTEXT: ABNORMAL RESPIRATORY FUNCTION IS KNOWN TO BE DETECTABLE ALMOST AS SOON AS IT CAN BE MEASURED RELIABLY. STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED THE EFFECT OF RESPIRATORY MUSCLE TRAINING AS WELL AS BREATHING EXERCISES IN IMPROVING PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN CHILDREN WITH DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY (DMD). AIMS: THIS STUDY AIMS TO IDENTIFY THE ADD-ON EFFECT OF YOGA OVER PHYSIOTHERAPY ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN CHILDREN WITH DMD. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FOUR PATIENTS WITH DMD WERE RANDOMIZED TO TWO GROUPS. GROUP I RECEIVED HOME-BASED PHYSIOTHERAPY AND GROUP II RECEIVED PHYSIOTHERAPY ALONG WITH YOGA INTERVENTION. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PULMONARY FUNCTION TEST (PFT) WAS ASSESSED BEFORE THE INTERVENTION (BASELINE DATA) AND AT REGULAR INTERVALS OF 3 MONTHS FOR A PERIOD OF 1 YEAR. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: NORMALITY WAS ASSESSED USING SHAPIRO-WILK NORMALITY TEST. THE BASELINE DATA WERE ANALYZED USING MANN-WHITNEY U-TEST TO IDENTIFY THE HOMOGENEITY. REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE WAS USED TO ASSESS SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN STUDY PARAMETERS DURING THE ASSESSMENT OF EVERY 3 MONTHS, BOTH WITHIN AND BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS OF PATIENTS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 88 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED ALL THE 5 ASSESSMENTS, WITH A MEAN AGE OF 7.9 +/- 1.5 YEARS. PFT PARAMETERS SUCH AS FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE, MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION (MVV), AND TIDAL VOLUME DURING MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION (MVT) DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN GROUP I. IN GROUP II, FVC AND MVT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED FROM BASELINE UP TO 1 YEAR, WHEREAS MVV IMPROVED FROM BASELINE UP TO 9 MONTHS. TIDAL VOLUME DID NOT SHOW ANY CHANGES IN BOTH THE GROUPS. CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT INTRODUCTION OF YOGA WITH PHYSIOTHERAPY INTERVENTION AT AN EARLY AGE CAN BE CONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES IN IMPROVING PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH DMD.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
8 1477  61 INTEGRATED YOGA PRACTICE IN CARDIAC REHABILITATION PROGRAM: A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL. BACKGROUND: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD) IS A DETRIMENTAL NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASE, WHICH IS INCREASING DUE TO SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE AND URBANIZATION IN THE YOUNG POPULATION. IT IS FURTHER ELEVATED WITH RISK FACTORS SUCH AS STRESS, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AN INCREASE IN TRIGLYCERIDES, DYSLIPIDEMIA, HYPERGLYCEMIA, HYPERTENSION, AND SO ON, WHICH MANIFESTS AS ATHEROSCLEROTIC DISEASE. YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION IS A NONINVASIVE EFFECTIVE TREATMENT METHOD TO CONTROL AND PREVENT CARDIAC RISK FACTORS IN CAD PATIENTS. YOGA HAS BEEN USED IN INDIA AS A THERAPEUTIC METHOD TO MANAGE HYPERTENSION AND OTHER CHRONIC DISORDERS AND IS FAST GAINING POPULARITY AS AN EFFECTIVE MEANS FOR THE ALLEVIATION OF STRESS, IMPROVEMENT OF FITNESS, AND ENHANCEMENT OF WELL-BEING. THIS STUDY AIMED TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF INTRODUCING THE INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY (IAYT) IN A CARDIAC REHABILITATION CENTER IN INDIA AND UNDERSTAND ITS USEFULNESS IN IMPROVING THE CARDIAC FUNCTION AND MANAGING THE CARDIAC RISK FACTORS IN ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION PATIENTS WITH LEFT VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION. METHODS AND DESIGN: CARDIAC PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO A YOGA-PRACTICING GROUP (N = 33) AND A CONTROL GROUP (N = 33). THE YOGA-PRACTICING GROUP WAS INSTRUCTED TO ATTEND THREE SUPERVISED IAYT CLASSES 3 DAYS PER WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS AT THE HOSPITAL YOGA CENTER. THE CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED STANDARD CARE THAT INCLUDED PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT AND THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE CARDIOLOGIST. THE OUTCOME MEASURES WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE (T1 = 0) AND COMPLETION (T2 = 3 MONTHS). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS THE LEFT VENTRICULAR EJECTION FRACTION (LVEF). RESULTS: THERE WAS NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN LVEF (U = 420.500, P VALUE = 0.218) BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. HOWEVER, THE YOGA-PRACTICING GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DEPRESSION (CARDIAC DEPRESSION SCALE [CDS], U = 71, P VALUE = 0.0), ANXIETY (HAMILTON ANXIETY RATING SCALE [HAM-A], U = 128, P VALUE = 0.0), AND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) SCORES (DUKE ACTIVITY STATUS INDEX [DASI], U = 146, P VALUE = 0.0; AND METABOLIC EQUIVALENTS (METS), U = 136, P VALUE = 0.0) AT 3 MONTHS COMPARED TO CONTROL. OVERALL, THE CAD PATIENTS PRACTICING YOGA SHOWED A FAVORABLE PROFILE COMPARED TO CONTROL INDIVIDUALS ON CDS, HAM-A, DASI, AND MET OUTCOMES. CONTROL AND YOGA PRACTICING GROUPS DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE LIPID LEVELS. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY INDICATED THAT THE INTEGRATION OF YOGA PRACTICE IN A CARDIAC REHABILITATION PROGRAM IS FEASIBLE AND HAS NO ADDED BENEFIT IN IMPROVING THE CARDIAC FUNCTION. HOWEVER, THE ADDITION OF YOGA TO CARDIAC REHABILITATION MAY BE BENEFICIAL IN REDUCING DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY AND IMPROVING QOL IN PATIENTS.	2020	

9 2547  37 YOGA FOR BRONCHIAL ASTHMA: A CONTROLLED STUDY. FIFTY THREE PATIENTS WITH ASTHMA UNDERWENT TRAINING FOR TWO WEEKS IN AN INTEGRATED SET OF YOGA EXERCISES, INCLUDING BREATHING EXERCISES, SURYANAMASKAR, YOGASANA (PHYSICAL POSTURES), PRANAYAMA (BREATH SLOWING TECHNIQUES), DHYANA (MEDITATION), AND A DEVOTIONAL SESSION, AND WERE TOLD TO PRACTISE THESE EXERCISES FOR 65 MINUTES DAILY. THEY WERE THEN COMPARED WITH A CONTROL GROUP OF 53 PATIENTS WITH ASTHMA MATCHED FOR AGE, SEX, AND TYPE AND SEVERITY OF ASTHMA, WHO CONTINUED TO TAKE THEIR USUAL DRUGS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN THE GROUP WHO PRACTISED YOGA IN THE WEEKLY NUMBER OF ATTACKS OF ASTHMA, SCORES FOR DRUG TREATMENT, AND PEAK FLOW RATE. THIS STUDY SHOWS THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN THE LONG TERM MANAGEMENT OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA, BUT THE PHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS FOR THIS BENEFICIAL EFFECT NEEDS TO BE EXAMINED IN MORE DETAIL.	1985	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
10  286  35 ADJUNCT TREATMENT WITH YOGA IN CHRONIC SEVERE AIRWAYS OBSTRUCTION. ELEVEN PATIENTS WITH SEVERE CHRONIC AIRWAYS OBSTRUCTION WERE GIVEN TRAINING IN YOGIC BREATHING EXERCISES AND POSTURES. A MATCHED GROUP OF 11 PATIENTS WERE GIVEN PHYSIOTHERAPY BREATHING EXERCISES. BOTH GROUPS OF PATIENTS WERE FOLLOWED UP AT MONTHLY INTERVALS FOR NINE MONTHS WITH PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS, TESTS OF EXERCISE TOLERANCE, AND INQUIRY INTO THEIR SYMPTOMS. AFTER TRAINING IN YOGA THE MEAN MAXIMUM WORK INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY BY 60.55 KPM; WHEREAS NO SUCH RISE OCCURRED AFTER TRAINING IN PHYSIOTHERAPY. THIS OBJECTIVE IMPROVEMENT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SYMPTOMATIC IMPROVEMENT IN A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NUMBER OF PATIENTS GIVEN TRAINING IN YOGA.	1978	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
11  844  44 EFFECT OF YOGA ON PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS OF HYPOTHYROID PATIENTS. AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO SEE ANY EFFECT ON RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS IN HYPOTHYROID PATIENTS AFTER PRANAYAMA (YOGA). THE SUBJECTS FOR THE STUDY WERE 20 HYPOTHYROID FEMALES, 39.70 +/- 8.27 YEARS OF MEAN AGE REFERRED FROM MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF UCMS & G.T.B. HOSPITAL. SPIRO METRIC RECORDINGS WERE TAKEN WITH HYPAIR (VERSION-1.28). BASELINE (FIRST) RECORDINGS WERE TAKEN WHEN PATIENT CAME FOR THE FIRST TIME. PATIENTS CAME TO YOGA LAB IN PHYSIOLOGY DEPARTMENT FOR 21 DAYS CONTINUOUSLY WHERE THEY WERE TRAINED BY THE YOGA INSTRUCTORS AND THEN TOLD TO DO PRANAYAMA AT HOME AND CALLED AT REGULAR INTERVALS AFTER 7 DAYS TO SEE THE COMPLIANCE. THE BREATHING EXERCISES WERE DONE FOR 45 MINUTES EVERYDAY. AFTER 6 MONTHS OF PRANAYAMA SECOND RECORDING WAS TAKEN AND COMPARED WITH THE BASELINE. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN FIRST SECOND (FEV1), MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION (MVV) AND INSPIRATORY CAPACITY(IC). THUS PRANAYAMA AND MEDITATION HAS BENEFICIAL EFFECT ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS OF HYPOTHYROID PATIENTS ALONG WITH CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
12 1520  65 IS YOGA TRAINING BENEFICIAL FOR EXERCISE-INDUCED BRONCHOCONSTRICTION? BACKGROUND: SOME STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH BRONCHIAL HYPERREACTIVITY WITH REGARD TO (1) A REDUCTION IN THE USE OF RESCUE MEDICATION, (2) AN INCREASE IN EXERCISE CAPACITY, AND (3) AN IMPROVEMENT IN LUNG FUNCTION. DESPITE THE FACT THAT YOGA IS PROMISING AS A NEW TREATMENT FOR PEDIATRIC PATIENTS, FURTHER STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO ASSESS THE USE OF THIS TRAINING FOR ASTHMA MANAGEMENT. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY WAS PERFORMED TO ASSESS THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA IN EXERCISE-INDUCED BRONCHOCONSTRICTION (EIB) IN CHILDREN. DESIGN: THE STUDY WAS PROSPECTIVE, WITH NO CONTROL GROUP. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY CHOSEN AMONG THE NEW PATIENTS AT THE UNIT. SETTING: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN THE ERCIYES UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, PEDIATRIC ALLERGY UNIT, IN KAYSERI, TURKEY. PARTICIPANTS: TWO GROUPS OF ASTHMATIC CHILDREN AGED 6-17 Y WERE ENROLLED IN THE STUDY: (1) CHILDREN WITH POSITIVE RESPONSES TO AN EXERCISE CHALLENGE (N = 10), AND (2) THOSE WITH NEGATIVE RESPONSES (N = 10). INTERVENTION: BOTH GROUPS ATTENDED 1-H SESSIONS OF YOGA TRAINING 2 X/WK FOR 3 MO. OUTCOME MEASURES: RESEARCHERS ADMINISTERED SPIROMETRIC MEASUREMENT TO ALL CHILDREN BEFORE AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER PARTICIPATING IN AN EXERCISE CHALLENGE. THIS PROCESS WAS PERFORMED AT BASELINE AND AT THE STUDY'S END. AGE, GENDER, IGE LEVELS, EOSINOPHIL NUMBERS, AND SPIROMETRIC MEASUREMENT PARAMETERS INCLUDING FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1 SEC (FEV1), FORCED EXPIRATORY FLOW 25%-75% (FEF25%-75%), FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW PERCENTAGE (PEF%), AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR) WERE COMPARED USING THE MANN-WHITNEY U TEST AND THE WILCOXON TEST. A P VALUE < .05 WAS CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT. RESULTS: AT BASELINE, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED BETWEEN THE GROUPS REGARDING DEMOGRAPHICS OR PRE-EXERCISE SPIROMETRIC MEASUREMENTS (P > .05, MANN-WHITNEY U TEST). LIKEWISE, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN SPIROMETRIC MEASUREMENTS EXISTED BETWEEN THE GROUPS REGARDING THE CHANGE IN RESPONSES TO AN EXERCISE CHALLENGE AFTER YOGA TRAINING (P > .05, WILCOXON TEST). FOR THE EXERCISE-RESPONSE-POSITIVE GROUP, THE RESEARCH TEAM OBSERVED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN MAXIMUM FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME 1% (FEV1%) FALL FOLLOWING THE EXERCISE CHALLENGE AFTER YOGA TRAINING (P > .05, WILCOXON TEST). ALL EXERCISE-RESPONSE-POSITIVE ASTHMATICS BECAME EXERCISERESPONSE-NEGATIVE ASTHMATICS AFTER YOGA TRAINING. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT TRAINING CHILDREN IN THE PRACTICE OF YOGA HAD BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON EIB. IT IS THE RESEARCH TEAM'S OPINION THAT YOGA TRAINING CAN SUPPLEMENT DRUG THERAPY TO ACHIEVE BETTER CONTROL OF ASTHMA.	2014	
                                                                                       
13 1904  56 RETARDATION OF CORONARY ATHEROSCLEROSIS WITH YOGA LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION. BACKGROUND: YOGA HAS POTENTIAL FOR BENEFIT FOR PATIENTS WITH CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE THOUGH OBJECTIVE, ANGIOGRAPHIC STUDIES ARE LACKING. MATERIAL AND METHODS: WE EVALUATED POSSIBLE ROLE OF LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION INCORPORATING YOGA, ON RETARDATION OF CORONARY ATHEROSCLEROTIC DISEASE. IN THIS PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL, 42 MEN WITH ANGIOGRAPHICALLY PROVEN CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD) WERE RANDOMIZED TO CONTROL (N = 21) AND YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 21) AND WERE FOLLOWED FOR ONE YEAR. THE ACTIVE GROUP WAS TREATED WITH A USER-FRIENDLY PROGRAM CONSISTING OF YOGA, CONTROL OF RISK FACTORS, DIET CONTROL AND MODERATE AEROBIC EXERCISE. THE CONTROL GROUP WAS MANAGED BY CONVENTIONAL METHODS I.E. RISK FACTOR CONTROL AND AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION STEP I DIET. RESULTS: AT ONE YEAR, THE YOGA GROUPS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN NUMBER OF ANGINAL EPISODES PER WEEK, IMPROVED EXERCISE CAPACITY AND DECREASE IN BODY WEIGHT. SERUM TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, LDL CHOLESTEROL AND TRIGLYCERIDE LEVELS ALSO SHOWED GREATER REDUCTIONS AS COMPARED WITH CONTROL GROUP. REVASCULARISATION PROCEDURES (CORONARY ANGIOPLASTY OR BYPASS SURGERY) WERE LESS FREQUENTLY REQUIRED IN THE YOGA GROUP (ONE VERSUS EIGHT PATIENTS; RELATIVE RISK = 5.45; P = 0.01). CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY REPEATED AT ONE YEAR SHOWED THAT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LESIONS REGRESSED (20% VERSUS 2%) AND LESS LESIONS PROGRESSED (5% VERSUS 37%) IN THE YOGA GROUP (CHI-SQUARE = 24.9; P < 0.0001). THE COMPLIANCE TO THE TOTAL PROGRAM WAS EXCELLENT AND NO SIDE EFFECTS WERE OBSERVED. CONCLUSION: YOGA LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION RETARDS PROGRESSION AND INCREASES REGRESSION OF CORONARY ATHEROSCLEROSIS IN PATIENTS WITH SEVERE CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.

TWENTYFIVE NORMAL MALE VOLUNTEERS UNDERGOING A TEN WEEKS COURSE IN THE PRACTICE OF YOGA HAVE BEEN STUDIED BY SOME PARAMETERS OF VENTILATORY FUNCTIONS TESTS. THE OBSERVATIONS RECORDED AT THE END OF TEN WEEKS OF THE COURSE HAVE SHOWN IMPROVED VENTILATORY FUNCTIONS IN THE FORM OF LOWERED RESPIRATORY RATE, INCREASED FORCED VITAL CAPACITY, FEV1, MAXIMUM BREATHING CAPACITY AND BREATH HOLDING TIME, WHILE TIDAL VOLUME AND %FEV1, DID NOT REVEAL ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. THUS, A COMBINED PRACTICE OF YOGA SEEMS TO BE BENEFICIAL ON RESPIRATORY EFFICIENCY.	1988	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
15  435  46 CARDIOPULMONARY AND METABOLIC EFFECTS OF YOGA IN HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS. BACKGROUND: YOGA THE SPIRITUAL UNION OF MIND WITH THE DIVINE INTELLIGENCE OF THE UNIVERSE AIMS TO LIBERATE A HUMAN BEING FROM CONFLICTS OF BODY-MIND DUALITY. BENEFICIAL CARDIOVASCULAR AND PULMONARY EFFECTS OF YOGA ARE IN PAR WITH AEROBIC EXERCISE, EVEN AMOUNTING TO REPLACE THE EXERCISE MODEL. WE CONDUCTED AN INTERVENTIONAL STUDY IN HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS, TO ANALYZE THE IMPACT OF SHORT-TERM YOGA TRAINING ON CARDIOVASCULAR, PULMONARY, AUTONOMIC FUNCTION TESTS, LIPID PROFILE, AND THYROID FUNCTION TESTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A SAMPLE OF FIFTY NEW RECRUITS ATTENDING THE DISTRICT YOGA CENTER WAS SUBJECT TO 75 MIN YOGA PRACTICE A DAY FOR 41 DAYS. BASAL VALUES OF CARDIOVASCULAR, PULMONARY, AUTONOMIC FUNCTION TESTS, LIPID PROFILE, AND THYROID FUNCTION TESTS WERE RECORDED BEFORE YOGA TRAINING AND WERE REASSESSED FOR POSTYOGA CHANGES AFTER 41 DAYS. RESULTS: AFTER YOGA PRACTICE THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE RESTING HEART RATE, SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE, DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE, AND MEAN BLOOD PRESSURE OF THE PARTICIPANTS. EFFECTS ON AUTONOMIC FUNCTION TESTS WERE VARIABLE AND INCONCLUSIVE. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN FORCED VITAL CAPACITY, FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1 S, AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE AFTER YOGA. A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN BODY MASS INDEX WAS OBSERVED. EFFECTS ON METABOLIC PARAMETERS WERE PROMISING WITH A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN FASTING BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL, SERUM TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, SERUM TRIGLYCERIDES SERUM LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN LEVELS, AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THYROID FUNCTION TESTS AFTER YOGA. CONCLUSION: SHORT-TERM YOGA PRACTICE HAS NO EFFECT ON THYROID FUNCTIONS. YOGA PRACTICE WAS FOUND BENEFICIAL IN MAINTAINING PHYSIOLOGICAL MILIEU PERTAINING TO CARDIOVASCULAR AND OTHER METABOLIC PARAMETERS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
16  904  57 EFFECTIVENESS OF ADJUVANT YOGA THERAPY IN DIABETIC LUNG: A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL. CONTEXT: RECENT STUDIES PROVIDE AMPLE EVIDENCE OF THE BENEFITS OF YOGA IN VARIOUS CHRONIC DISORDERS. DIABETES MELLITUS IS A GROUP OF METABOLIC DISEASES CHARACTERIZED BY CHRONIC HYPERGLYCEMIA AND SANDLER COINED THE TERM "DIABETIC LUNG" FOR THE ABNORMAL PULMONARY FUNCTION DETECTED IN DIABETIC PATIENTS DUE UNDERLYING PULMONARY DYSFUNCTION. YOGA THERAPY MAY HELP IN ACHIEVING BETTER PULMONARY FUNCTION ALONG WITH ENHANCED GLYCAEMIC CONTROL AND OVERALL HEALTH BENEFITS. AIM: TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF ADJUVANT YOGA THERAPY IN DIABETIC LUNG THROUGH SPIROMETRY. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL WAS MADE AS INTERDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATIVE WORK BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS OF YOGA THERAPY, PULMONARY MEDICINE AND ENDOCRINOLOGY, OF MGMC & RI, SRI BALAJI VIDYAPEETH PUDUCHERRY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 72 PATIENTS OF DIABETIC LUNG AS CONFIRMED BY SPIROMETRY (<70% OF EXPECTED) WERE RANDOMIZED INTO CONTROL GROUP (N=36) WHO RECEIVED ONLY STANDARD MEDICAL TREATMENT AND YOGA GROUP (N=36) WHO RECEIVED YOGA TRAINING THRICE WEEKLY FOR 4 MONTHS ALONG WITH STANDARD MEDICAL MANAGEMENT. YOGA THERAPY PROTOCOL INCLUDED YOGIC COUNSELING, PREPARATORY PRACTICES, ASANAS OR STATIC POSTURES, PRANAYAMA OR BREATHING TECHNIQUES AND RELAXATION TECHNIQUES. HATHENAS OF THE GITANANDA YOGA TRADITION WERE THE MAIN PRACTICES USED. SPIROMETRY WAS DONE AT THE END OF THE STUDY PERIOD. DATA WAS ANALYZED BY STUDENT'S PAIRED AND UNPAIRED 'T' TEST AS IT PASSED NORMALITY. RESULTS: THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.05) REDUCTION IN WEIGHT, AND BMI ALONG WITH A SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.01) IMPROVEMENT IN PULMONARY FUNCTION (FEV1, FVC) IN YOGA GROUP AS COMPARED TO CONTROL GROUP WHERE PARAMETERS WORSENED OVER STUDY PERIOD. CONCLUSION: IT IS CONCLUDED FROM THE PRESENT RCT THAT YOGA HAS A DEFINITE ROLE AS AN ADJUVANT THERAPY AS IT ENHANCES STANDARD MEDICAL CARE AND HENCE IS EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT IN ROUTINE CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES, IMPROVING PHYSICAL CONDITION AND PULMONARY FUNCTION.	2019

IT IS CONCLUDED THAT YOGA TRAINING IS BENEFICIAL FOR YOUNG ASTHMATICS.	1991	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
18 2929  39 [YOGA TO IMPROVE ASTHMA CONTROL IN SEVERE ASTHMATICS TREATED WITH BIOLOGICS]. WE CONDUCTED A PROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL STUDY TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN POORLY CONTROLLED SEVERE ASTHMATIC PATIENTS TREATED WITH MAXIMAL INHALED THERAPY AND BIOLOGICS. THE OBJECTIVE OF YOGA WAS TO IMPROVE BREATHING CONSCIOUSNESS, EXERCISING CONTROLLED VENTILATION WITH AND WITHOUT RETENTION, ABDOMINAL BREATHING OBSERVATION, IMPROVEMENT OF INSPIRATORY AND EXPIRATORY MUSCLES, OPENING OF THE CHEST, DIAPHRAGM EXERCISES AND RELAXATION. WE MEASURED EXHALED NITRIC OXIDE, FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN ONE SECOND, FORCED VITAL CAPACITY, ASTHMA CONTROL AND QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRES, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION QUESTIONNAIRES BEFORE AND AFTER THE TENTH YOGA COURSE (PERFORMED TWICE A WEEK). HALF OF THE PATIENTS WHO WERE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE TO THE STUDY DECLINED DUE TO ORGANIZATION PROBLEMS. TWO PATIENTS WERE EXCLUDED DUE TO BRONCHITIS AND ARTHRALGIA RESPECTIVELY. THE ANALYSIS OF THE DATA FROM 12 PARTICIPANTS REVEALED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ASTHMA CONTROL AND ASTHMA QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRES AND A REDUCTION OF ANXIETY.THE REGULAR PRACTICE OF YOGA IN SEVERE ASTHMATICS INSUFFICIENTLY CONTROLLED DESPITE MAXIMAL INHALED TREATMENT AND BIOTHERAPY SEEMS TO BE AN INTERESTING COMPLEMENTARY OPTION TO IMPROVE ASTHMA CONTROL. OUR RESULTS MUST BE CONFIRMED IN LARGER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
19 1835  30 PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES AT THE TIME OF EXAMINATION IN MEDICAL STUDENTS BEFORE AND AFTER THE PRACTICE OF YOGA AND RELAXATION. THE EFFECT OF YOGA AND RELAXATION CHANGES IN PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS IN RESPONSE TO THE STRESS OF EXAMINATION IN 75 MEDICAL STUDENTS WAS STUDIED. INITIALLY FIVE PARAMETERS (ANXIETY LEVEL, HEART RATE, BLOOD PRESSURE, GALVANIC SKIN RESISTANCE AND CHOICE REACTION TIME) WERE RECORDED, A MONTH BEFORE THE EXAMINATION AND ON THE DAY OF EXAMINATION. STUDENTS WERE THEN RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO 3 GROUP OF 25 EACH. ONE GROUP PRACTICED YOGA (GROUP- Y), AND ANOTHER GROUP PRACTICED RELAXATION (GROUP-R) REGULARLY FOR THREE MONTHS. THE THIRD GROUP WAS CONTROL GROUP (GROUP-C). ALL THE PARAMETERS WERE RECORDED AFTER THE CHANGES IN ANXIETY LEVEL, HEART RATE, BLOOD PRESSURE, AND GALVANIC SKIN RESISTANCE IN RESPONSE TO STRESS OF EXAMINATION WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ATTENUATED AND THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN CHOICE REACTION TIME IN GROUP-Y AND GROUP-R AS COMPARED TO GROUP-C AFTER YOGA AND RELAXATION.	1998	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
20 2072  49 THE EFFECT OF A SIX-WEEK PROGRAM OF YOGA AND MEDITATION ON BRACHIAL ARTERY REACTIVITY: DO PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTIONS AFFECT VASCULAR TONE? BACKGROUND: CHRONIC STRESS IS ESTIMATED TO INCREASE THE RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR (CV) EVENTS TWO-FOLD. ALTHOUGH STRESS REDUCTION HAS BEEN LINKED TO A REDUCTION IN CV EVENTS, LITTLE IS KNOWN REGARDING ITS EXACT MECHANISM OF BENEFIT. HYPOTHESIS: YOGA AND MEDITATION WILL IMPROVE PARAMETERS OF ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION. METHODS: WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND MEDITATION ON HEMODYNAMIC AND LABORATORY PARAMETERS AS WELL AS ON ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION IN A 6-WEEK PILOT STUDY. SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURES, HEART RATE, BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), FASTING GLUCOSE, LIPIDS, HS C-REACTIVE PROTEIN (CRP), AND ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION (AS ASSESSED BY BRACHIAL ARTERY REACTIVITY) WERE ALL STUDIED AT BASELINE AND AFTER 6 WEEKS OF YOGA PRACTICE. RESULTS: A COURSE IN YOGA AND MEDITATION WAS GIVEN TO THE SUBJECTS FOR 1.5 H THREE TIMES WEEKLY FOR 6 WEEKS AND SUBJECTS WERE INSTRUCTED TO CONTINUE THEIR EFFORTS AT HOME. THIS PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY INCLUDED 33 SUBJECTS (MEAN AGE 55 +/- 11 YEARS) BOTH WITH (30%) AND WITHOUT (70%) ESTABLISHED CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD). THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN BLOOD PRESSURE, HEART RATE, AND BMI IN THE TOTAL COHORT WITH YOGA. NONE OF THE LABORATORY PARAMETERS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH YOGA. FOR THE TOTAL COHORT THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ENDOTHELIAL-DEPENDENT VASODILATATION WITH YOGA TRAINING AND MEDITATION COMPARED WITH BASELINE (16.7% RELATIVE IMPROVEMENT FROM 7.2-8.4%; P = 0.3). IN THE GROUP WITH CAD, ENDOTHELIAL-DEPENDENT VASODILATATION IMPROVED 69% WITH YOGA TRAINING (6.38-10.78%; P = 0.09). CONCLUSION: YOGA AND MEDITATION APPEAR TO IMPROVE ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION IN SUBJECTS WITH CAD.	2006

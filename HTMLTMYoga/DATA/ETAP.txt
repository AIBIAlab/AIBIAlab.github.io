1 1167 123 EVALUATING THE USE OF MINDFULNESS AND YOGA TRAINING ON FORENSIC INPATIENTS: A PILOT STUDY. FORENSIC INPATIENTS (I. E., INDIVIDUALS FOUND NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR A CRIMINAL OFFENSE ON ACCOUNT OF MENTAL ILLNESS) REPRESENT AN OFTEN MARGINALIZED AND DIFFICULT-TO-TREAT POPULATION. THIS HAS LED TO THE NEED FOR RESEARCH EXPLORING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF NOVEL INTERVENTIONS. A CANADIAN FORENSIC HOSPITAL HAS DEVELOPED AN 8-WEEKS MINDFULNESS AND YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM (MTP). THIS PILOT STUDY EXAMINED THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF THIS PROGRAM ON PATIENTS' MINDFULNESS, STRESS, AND USE OF COGNITIVE AND EMOTION REGULATION STRATEGIES. A SAMPLE OF 13 FORENSIC INPATIENTS (MALE = 92%) PARTICIPATING IN THE MTP PROGRAM COMPLETED SELF-REPORT MEASURES ASSESSING DISPOSITIONAL MINDFULNESS, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND USE OF COGNITIVE EMOTION REGULATION STRATEGIES AT BASELINE, POST-INTERVENTION, AND A 3-MONTHS FOLLOW-UP. REPEATED MEASURE ANOVAS FOUND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE DESCRIBE FACET OF MINDFULNESS (P = 0.03) WITH A LARGE EFFECT SIZE (ETAP (2) = 0.26) AND A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN STRESS (P = 0.003) WITH A LARGE EFFECT SIZE (ETAP (2) = 0.39). PAIRWISE COMPARISONS REVEALED MEDIUM TO LARGE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES BETWEEN BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION FOR BOTH THE DESCRIBE FACET (P = 0.03, HEDGE'S G = 0.55) AND STRESS (P = 0.003, HEDGE'S G = 0.70). HOWEVER, COMPARISONS WERE INSIGNIFICANT BETWEEN BASELINE AND FOLLOW-UP. NO SIGNIFICANT MAIN EFFECTS WERE FOUND ON THE USE OF COGNITIVE EMOTION REGULATION STRATEGIES. THIS PILOT STUDY OFFERS PRELIMINARY SUPPORT FOR THE USE OF THE MTP AS AN ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY IN FORENSIC INPATIENT TREATMENT. FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS NEEDED INTO THE LONG-TERM IMPACTS OF THIS TRAINING.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
2 1195  30 EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA INSTRUCTION ON POSITIVE EMBODIMENT AND AFFECTIVE RESPONSES. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR THE INCLUSION OF YOGA AS PART OF EATING DISORDER PREVENTION EFFORTS THROUGH ITS POSITIVE IMPACT ON POSITIVE EMBODIMENT AND EXPERIENCE OF POSITIVE CORE AFFECT. HOWEVER, THERE IS A NEED TO IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES THAT WILL MORE CONSISTENTLY SUPPORT POSITIVE EMBODIMENT AND POSITIVE AFFECT. WE EXAMINED THE EFFECT OF TEACHING A SINGLE YOGA CLASS USING MINDFULNESS-BASED INSTRUCTION COMPARED TO APPEARANCE-BASED AND NEUTRAL INSTRUCTION ALTERNATIVES ON EMBODIMENT (I.E., STATE BODY SURVEILLANCE, STATE BODY APPRECIATION, PLEASURE DURING YOGA) AND CHANGES IN AFFECT FROM BEFORE TO AFTER CLASS. FEMALE PARTICIPANTS (N = 62; M AGE = 23.89, SD = 6.86) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A YOGA CLASS THAT EMPHASIZED: BEING MINDFULLY PRESENT IN ONE'S BODY, CHANGING ONE'S APPEARANCE, OR JUST GETTING INTO YOGA POSES. ANOVAS REVEALED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER BODY SURVEILLANCE (ETAP (2) =.10) AND LOWER FORECASTED PLEASURE (ETAP (2) =.21) IN THE APPEARANCE CLASS COMPARED TO THE OTHER TWO CLASSES. PARTICIPANTS IN THE MINDFULNESS CLASS EXPERIENCED GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN AFFECT (ETAP (2) =.08) FROM BEFORE TO AFTER CLASS AND HIGHER REMEMBERED PLEASURE DURING THE YOGA CLASS (ETAP (2) =.19) COMPARED TO THOSE IN THE APPEARANCE CLASS. EMPHASIZING CHANGES TO APPEARANCE IN YOGA INSTRUCTION MAY PLACE PARTICIPANTS AT RISK FOR LESS POSITIVE AFFECT AND LESS POSITIVE EXPERIENCES OF EMBODIMENT COMPARED TO MINDFULNESS-BASED OR EVEN NEUTRAL YOGA INSTRUCTION.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
3 1719  30 PERCEIVED USEFULNESS OF YOGA TO MAINTAIN WELL-BEING AND IN RELATION TO COVID-19 CASES AMONG HUNGARIAN YOGA PRACTITIONERS. BACKGROUND: THE PRESENT COVID-19 EPIDEMIC HAS HAD A CONSIDERABLE IMPACT ON THE MENTAL HEALTH OF INDIVIDUALS WORLDWIDE. RESEARCH PROJECTS SUGGESTS POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE FOR PREVENTION, OR AS MEDICAL SUPPLEMENTATION IN RELATION TO THE PRESENT PANDEMIC. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN YOGA AND HEALTH STATUS, AND HOW THE FREQUENCY OF YOGA PRACTICE AFFECTED THE MENTAL WELL-BEING (MWB) OF THE RESPONDENTS. METHODS: HUNGARIAN YOGA PRACTITIONERS (N=379) AGED 20 TO 75 YEARS (93.4% FEMALE) WERE ASKED ABOUT THEIR PERSONAL HEALTH, PERCEIVED USEFULNESS OF YOGA PRACTICE FOR COVID-19 CASES AND THEIR MWB. DATA WERE COLLECTED BETWEEN APRIL 17 AND MAY 17, 2021. THE MEASUREMENT TOOL USED WAS AN ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRE INCLUDING SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC DATA, CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA PRACTICE, COVID-19 AND HEALTH RELATED QUESTIONS, AND WHO WELL-BEING INDEX (WBI-5). ASSOCIATIONS WERE EXAMINED THROUGH ANOVA AND CHI-SQUARE TESTS. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE AMONG THE YOGA PRACTICE GROUPS BY WEEKLY FREQUENCY (ONCE A WEEK, 2-3 TIMES A WEEK, 4-5 TIMES A WEEK, DAILY) ON THE TOTAL MEAN SCORE OF WELL-BEING (WBI-5), F (3, 373) = 12.97, P < 0.001, ETAP 2 = 0.094. THE DAILY PRACTICE OF YOGA SHOWED THE HIGHEST MWB. CONCLUSIONS: ACCORDING TO OUR FINDINGS, IT CAN BE STATED THAT REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER LEVEL OF MWB WHICH CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN DEALING WITH COVID-19 ISSUES SUCH AS STRESS AND DEPRESSION.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
4 1017  29 EFFECTS OF SINGLE BOUTS OF WALKING EXERCISE AND YOGA ON ACUTE MOOD SYMPTOMS IN PEOPLE WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. BACKGROUND: LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE ACUTE OR IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF WALKING EXERCISE AND YOGA ON MOOD IN PEOPLE WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS). SUCH AN EXAMINATION IS IMPORTANT FOR IDENTIFYING AN EXERCISE MODALITY FOR INCLUSION IN EXERCISE-TRAINING INTERVENTIONS THAT YIELDS MOOD BENEFITS IN MS. WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF SINGLE BOUTS OF TREADMILL WALKING AND YOGA COMPARED WITH A QUIET, SEATED-REST CONTROL CONDITION ON ACUTE MOOD SYMPTOMS IN MS. METHODS: TWENTY-FOUR PARTICIPANTS WITH MS COMPLETED 20 MINUTES OF TREADMILL WALKING, YOGA, OR QUIET REST IN A RANDOMIZED, COUNTERBALANCED ORDER WITH 1 WEEK BETWEEN SESSIONS. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE PROFILE OF MOOD STATES QUESTIONNAIRE BEFORE AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER EACH CONDITION. TOTAL MOOD DISTURBANCE (TMD) AND THE SIX SUBSCALES OF THE PROFILE OF MOOD STATES WERE ANALYZED USING REPEATED-MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE AND PAIRED-SAMPLES T TESTS. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT CONDITION X TIME INTERACTION ON TMD SCORES (ETAP (2) = 0.13). WALKING AND YOGA CONDITIONS YIELDED COMPARABLE REDUCTIONS IN TMD SCORES. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT CONDITION X TIME INTERACTION ON VIGOR (ETAP (2) = 0.23) WHEREBY WALKING BUT NOT YOGA YIELDED AN IMPROVEMENT IN VIGOR. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT MAIN EFFECT OF TIME ON ANGER, CONFUSION, DEPRESSION, AND TENSION (P < .05) BUT NOT ON FATIGUE. CONCLUSIONS: WALKING AND YOGA YIELDED SIMILAR IMPROVEMENTS IN OVERALL ACUTE MOOD SYMPTOMS, AND WALKING IMPROVED FEELINGS OF VIGOR. THESE EFFECTS SHOULD BE FURTHER INVESTIGATED IN LONG-TERM EXERCISE-TRAINING STUDIES.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
5 2278  26 THE ROLES OF SELF-COMPASSION, BODY SURVEILLANCE, AND BODY APPRECIATION IN PREDICTING INTRINSIC MOTIVATION FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: CROSS-SECTIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, AND PROSPECTIVE CHANGES WITHIN A YOGA CONTEXT. ENGAGING IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOR THE IMMEDIATE INTERNAL EXPERIENCES IT BRINGS (E.G., PLEASURE, SATISFACTION) IS CRITICAL FOR LONG-TERM EXERCISE ADHERENCE. INVESTIGATIONS OF HOW FACTORS SUCH AS BODY IMAGE CONTRIBUTE TO INTRINSIC MOTIVATION FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ARE NEEDED. THE PRESENT STUDY EXAMINED BODY SURVEILLANCE AND BODY APPRECIATION AS MEDIATORS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SELF-COMPASSION AND INTRINSIC MOTIVATION FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY CROSS-SECTIONALLY AND PROSPECTIVELY. ONE SAMPLE OF COLLEGE WOMEN COMPLETED MEASURES OF STUDY VARIABLES AT ONE TIME POINT (SAMPLE 1; N = 269, MAGE = 19.96) AND A SECOND SAMPLE DID SO DURING WEEKS 1, 8, AND 16 WHILE PARTICIPATING IN A 16-WEEK YOGA COURSE (SAMPLE 2; N = 323, MAGE = 20.31). IN SAMPLE 1, LATENT VARIABLE STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING SUPPORTED BODY APPRECIATION AS A MEDIATOR BETWEEN SELF-COMPASSION AND INTRINSIC MOTIVATION FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. IN SAMPLE 2, LATENT GROWTH CURVE ANALYSES REVEALED THAT CHANGE IN SELF-COMPASSION PREDICTED CHANGES IN BODY SURVEILLANCE AND BODY APPRECIATION IN EXPECTED DIRECTIONS. FURTHER, CHANGE IN BODY APPRECIATION POSITIVELY PREDICTED CHANGE IN INTRINSIC MOTIVATION. TARGETING SELF-COMPASSION AND BODY APPRECIATION MAY HELP SUPPORT WOMEN'S INTRINSIC MOTIVATION FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
6 1492  39 INTERNALIZED WEIGHT STIGMA AND INTUITIVE EATING AMONG STRESSED ADULTS DURING A MINDFUL YOGA INTERVENTION: ASSOCIATIONS WITH CHANGES IN MINDFULNESS AND SELF-COMPASSION. PURPOSE: INTERNALIZED WEIGHT STIGMA (IWS) IS COMMON IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ACROSS BODY WEIGHT CATEGORIES, AND IS IMPLICATED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DISTRESS AND UNHEALTHY EATING BEHAVIORS (E.G. OVEREATING, DISORDERED EATING) THAT CAN FOSTER POOR CARDIOMETABOLIC HEALTH. WHILE EMERGING INTERVENTION RESEARCH SHOWS EARLY PROMISE IN REDUCING IWS, LONG-TERM EFFICACY IS UNCLEAR AND NOVEL STRATEGIES REMAIN NEEDED. THIS ANALYSIS EXAMINED WHETHER PARTICIPATION IN A MINDFUL YOGA INTERVENTION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED IWS AND INCREASED INTUITIVE EATING, AN ADAPTIVE EATING BEHAVIOR, AND WHETHER THESE CHANGES CORRELATED WITH EACH OTHER OR WITH CHANGES IN MINDFULNESS AND SELF-COMPASSION. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE STRESSED ADULTS WITH LOW FRUIT AND VEGETABLE INTAKE (N = 78, 64.1% WHITE, M. BODY MASS INDEX 25.59 +/- 4.45) ENROLLED IN A PARENT CLINICAL TRIAL OF A 12-WEEK MINDFUL YOGA INTERVENTION. VALIDATED SELF-REPORT MEASURES OF IWS, INTUITIVE EATING, MINDFULNESS, AND SELF-COMPASSION WERE ADMINISTERED AT PRE-TREATMENT, MID-TREATMENT (8 WEEKS), POST-TREATMENT (12 WEEKS), AND 4-MONTH FOLLOW-UP (24 WEEKS). RESULTS: LINEAR MIXED MODELING REVEALED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN IWS AND INTUITIVE EATING ACROSS THE FOUR TIMEPOINTS (P < .001). REDUCED IWS CORRELATED WITH INCREASED INTUITIVE EATING PRE- TO POST-TREATMENT (P = .01). IMPROVED SELF-COMPASSION AND MINDFULNESS CORRELATED WITH INTUITIVE EATING (BOTH P = . 04), BUT NOT IWS (P = .74 AND P = .56, RESPECTIVELY). CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY OFFERS PRELIMINARY SUPPORT FOR THE HYPOTHESIS THAT MINDFUL YOGA MAY PROMOTE INTUITIVE EATING AND REDUCE IWS AMONG STRESSED ADULTS WITH POOR DIET, AND SUGGESTS THAT CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS MAY CO-OCCUR OVER TIME. FURTHER INVESTIGATION WITH CONTROLLED DESIGNS IS NECESSARY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE TEMPORALITY AND CAUSALITY OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS.TRIAL REGISTRATION: CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT02098018.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
7  128  18 A PILOT YOGA PHYSICAL EDUCATION CURRICULUM TO PROMOTE POSITIVE BODY IMAGE. WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF A PILOT YOGA-BASED PHYSICAL EDUCATION (PE) CURRICULUM BY TESTING FOR CHANGE IN TRAIT BODY SURVEILLANCE, PHYSICAL SELF-WORTH, AND BODY APPRECIATION. FURTHER, WE EXAMINED THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG CHANGE IN BODY IMAGE VARIABLES AND THE ROLE OF STATE MINDFULNESS IN PREDICTING STATE BODY SURVEILLANCE DURING CLASSES. ADOLESCENTS PARTICIPATED IN 12 WEEKS OF YOGA-BASED (N=20; MAGE=16.45, 90% FEMALE) OR TRADITIONAL (N=23;MAGE=14.52, 57% FEMALE) PE. RESULTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT (P=.004), MODERATE DECREASES IN TRAIT BODY SURVEILLANCE AND MINIMAL NONSIGNIFICANT (P=.11) INCREASES IN PHYSICAL SELF-WORTH. CHANGE IN TRAIT BODY SURVEILLANCE WAS INVERSELY RELATED TO CHANGE IN PHYSICAL SELF-WORTH AND BODY APPRECIATION IN YOGA PARTICIPANTS. MULTI-LEVEL MODELING ANALYSES REVEALED THAT MORE MINDFUL STUDENTS ALSO SURVEYED THEIR BODY LESS DURING CLASS. INTENTIONALLY STRUCTURED YOGA PARTICIPATION MAY SUPPORT POSITIVE BODY IMAGE AMONG ADOLESCENTS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
8 1209  25 EXPLORING CHANGES IN MINDFULNESS AND BODY APPRECIATION DURING YOGA PARTICIPATION. EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE POSITIVE ROLE THAT YOGA PARTICIPATION CAN PLAY IN PREDICTING POSITIVE BODY IMAGE EXPERIENCES. HOWEVER, LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT THE MECHANISMS THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN THIS RELATIONSHIP. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO TEST FOR CHANGE IN STATE AND TRAIT MINDFULNESS AND BODY APPRECIATION AS WELL AS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHANGE IN TRAIT MINDFULNESS AND CHANGE IN BODY APPRECIATION ACROSS 16 WEEKS OF YOGA PARTICIPATION. PARTICIPANTS (N=376; MAGE=20.45; 87% FEMALE) WERE RECRUITED FROM FOR-CREDIT YOGA CLASSES AT A UNIVERSITY. THEY COMPLETED MEASURES OF TRAIT MINDFULNESS AND BODY APPRECIATION AT THE BEGINNING, MID-POINT, AND END OF THE 16-WEEK COURSE. THEY ALSO COMPLETED A MEASURE OF STATE MINDFULNESS OF THE BODY THAT TARGETED THEIR EXPERIENCE DURING YOGA EVERY OTHER WEEK AFTER CLASS. LATENT GROWTH CURVES WERE ESTIMATED FOR EACH VARIABLE AND DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT (P<.001) POSITIVE CHANGE IN TRAIT MINDFULNESS AND BODY APPRECIATION. THE FULL STRUCTURAL MODEL SHOWED THAT THE RATE OF CHANGE IN TRAIT MINDFULNESS ASSOCIATED POSITIVELY WITH THE RATE OF CHANGE IN BODY APPRECIATION. THIS SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP SUPPORTS THE ROLE THAT MINDFULNESS MAY PLAY IN SUPPORTING GROWTH IN POSITIVE BODY IMAGE DURING YOGA PARTICIPATION.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
9 2535  29 YOGA ENHANCES POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL STATES IN YOUNG ADULT MUSICIANS. ALTHOUGH YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE A VIABLE TECHNIQUE FOR IMPROVING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE MIND AND BODY, LITTLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN DIRECTED TO STUDYING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOGA AND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL STATES OF FLOW AND MINDFULNESS. MUSICIANS ENROLLED IN A 2-MONTH FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM IN 2005, 2006 AND 2007 WERE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN A YOGA AND MEDITATION PROGRAM. FELLOWS NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE YOGA PROGRAM WERE RECRUITED SEPARATELY AS CONTROLS. ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED BASELINE AND END-PROGRAM QUESTIONNAIRES EVALUATING DISPOSITIONAL FLOW, MINDFULNESS, CONFUSION, AND MUSIC PERFORMANCE ANXIETY. COMPARED TO CONTROLS, YOGA PARTICIPANTS REPORTED SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN CONFUSION AND INCREASES IN DISPOSITIONAL FLOW. YOGA PARTICIPANTS IN THE 2006 SAMPLE ALSO REPORTED SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE MINDFULNESS SUBSCALE OF AWARENESS. CORRELATIONAL ANALYSES REVEALED THAT INCREASES IN PARTICIPANTS' DISPOSITIONAL FLOW AND MINDFULNESS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASES IN CONFUSION AND MUSIC PERFORMANCE ANXIETY. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THE COMMONALITIES BETWEEN POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY AND YOGA, BOTH OF WHICH ARE FOCUSED ON ENHANCING HUMAN PERFORMANCE AND PROMOTING BENEFICIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL STATES. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA AND MEDITATION MAY ENHANCE THE STATES OF FLOW AND MINDFUL AWARENESS, AND REDUCE CONFUSION.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
10 1505  29 IREST YOGA-NIDRA ON THE COLLEGE CAMPUS: CHANGES IN STRESS, DEPRESSION, WORRY, AND MINDFULNESS. OBJECTIVES: THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT YOGA PRACTICE IS ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED STRESS, WORRY, AND DEPRESSION, AND WITH IMPROVED MINDFULNESS-BASED SKILLS. THESE FINDINGS HAD NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY REPLICATED FOR A SAMPLE OF COLLEGE STUDENTS. THIS STUDY EVALUATED WHETHER IREST YOGA-NIDRA PRACTICE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED PERCEIVED STRESS, WORRY, AND DEPRESSION, AND INCREASED MINDFULNESS IN A SAMPLE OF COLLEGE STUDENT S. METHODS: SIXTY-SIX STUDENTS AGE 18-56 COMPLETED AN 8-WEEK IREST YOGA-NIDRA INTERVENTION THAT WAS OFFERED FOR 8 SEMESTERS. ASSESSMENT OCCURRED 1 WEEK PRIOR TO INTERVENTION ONSET AND DURING THE CLASS PERIOD FOLLOWING THE INTERVENTION. QUALITATIVE DATA WERE COLLECTED AT WEEKS 4 AND 8. RESULTS: STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT PRE- TO POSTTEST IMPROVEMENTS IN PERCEIVED STRESS, WORRY, AND DEPRESSION WERE FOUND. PRE-EXISTING DEPRESSION ACCOUNTED FOR MOST OF THE CHANGE IN WORRY AND PERCEIVED STRESS SCORES. PRE- TO POST TEST IMPROVEMENTS IN MINDFULNESS-BASED SKILLS WERE ALSO DETECTED. CONCLUSIONS: IREST YOGA-NIDRA PRACTICE MAY REDUCE SYMPTOMS OF PERCEIVED STRESS, WORRY, AND DEPRESSION AND INCREASE MINDFULNESS-BASED SKILLS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
11 2177  24 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON MOOD IN PSYCHIATRIC INPATIENTS. THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON MOOD WERE EXAMINED IN 13 PSYCHIATRIC INPATIENTS AT NEW HAMPSHIRE HOSPITAL. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE PROFILE OF MOOD STATES (POMS) PRIOR TO AND FOLLOWING PARTICIPATION IN A YOGA CLASS. ANALYSES INDICATED THAT PARTICIPANTS REPORTED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS ON ALL FIVE OF THE NEGATIVE EMOTION FACTORS ON THE POMS, INCLUDING TENSION-ANXIETY, DEPRESSION-DEJECTION, ANGER-HOSTILITY, FATIGUE-INERTIA, AND CONFUSION-BEWILDERMENT. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE ON THE SIXTH POMS FACTOR, VIGOR-ACTIVITY. IMPROVEMENTS IN MOOD WERE NOT RELATED TO GENDER OR DIAGNOSIS. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED MOOD, AND MAY BE A USEFUL WAY OF REDUCING STRESS DURING INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT.	2005	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
12   96  28 A NATURALISTIC STUDY OF YOGA, MEDITATION, SELF-PERCEIVED STRESS, SELF-COMPASSION, AND MINDFULNESS IN COLLEGE STUDENTS. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY COMPARED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS MEDITATION ON SELF-COMPASSION, MINDFULNESS, AND PERCEIVED STRESS IN COLLEGE STUDENTS; AND EXPLORED MIND-BODY MECHANISMS AND PREDICTORS OF STRESS REDUCTION. PARTICIPANTS: STUDENT PARTICIPANTS (N = 92) WERE ENROLLED IN EITHER YOGA OR MINDFULNESS MEDITATION CLASSES AT A COLLEGE IN THE SOUTHERN UNITED STATES FROM AUGUST THROUGH MAY OF 2015-2016. METHODS: STUDENTS PARTICIPATED IN 50-MINUTE CLASSES TWICE A WEEK FOR 10 WEEKS, COMPLETING SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES DURING THE 1ST AND 10TH WEEK. RESULTS: MULTIPLE-LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS FOUND CHANGE IN SELF-COMPASSION WAS THE STRONGEST PREDICTOR OF STRESS REDUCTION. CONCLUSIONS: INCREASING SELF-COMPASSION MAY INCREASE THE EFFICACY OF MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS. RESEARCH INTO MIND-BODY MECHANISMS IS NEEDED TO IDENTIFY INTERVENTION COMPONENTS THAT MOST IMPROVE STUDENT WELL-BEING.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
13  262  41 ACUTE AND CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF VINYASA YOGA ON AFFECT AND STRESS AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS PARTICIPATING IN AN EIGHT-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE VULNERABLE TO A CRITICAL PERIOD IN DEVELOPMENTAL MATURATION, FACING RIGOROUS ACADEMIC WORK AND LEARNING HOW TO FUNCTION INDEPENDENTLY. WESTERN AEROBIC EXERCISE (WAE), SUCH AS RUNNING AND BICYCLING, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE MOOD AND RELIEVE STRESS. HOWEVER, COLLEGE STUDENTS OFTEN HAVE LOW LEVELS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. YOGA IS AN ANCIENT PHYSICAL AND MENTAL PRACTICE THAT MAY AFFECT MOOD AND STRESS. HOWEVER, RIGOROUS STUDIES EXAMINING THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF YOGA ARE RARE IN PEERREVIEWED WESTERN JOURNALS. THE AIM OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO ESTABLISH PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE FOR THE ACUTE EFFECTS OF VINYASA YOGA ON AFFECT AND STRESS IN YOUNG-ADULT COLLEGE STUDENTS. METHODS: TWENTY HEALTHY COLLEGE STUDENTS AGE 18 YEARS AND OLDER WERE RECRUITED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PILOT STUDY. PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED A VINYASA YOGA CLASS AT A LOCAL STUDIO TWICE WEEKLY FOR 8 WEEKS. AFFECT AND STRESS WERE ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER EACH YOGA SESSION. MEASURES INCLUDED THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECTIVE SCHEDULE (PANAS) AND THE COHEN PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE. RESULTS: POSITIVE AFFECT SCORES INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (P < 0.05) FOR 14 OF THE 16 YOGA SESSIONS (MEAN INCREASE = 23.2%). NEGATIVE AFFECT DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PRE- TO POSTYOGA (P < 0.05) FOR 15 OF THE 16 SESSIONS (MEAN DECREASE = 22%). REPEATED MEASURES ANOVAS EXAMINING PRE-POST COMPOSITE SCORES ACROSS ALL 8 WEEKS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PANAS, BUT NOT STRESS SCORES. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA PRACTICE IS ASSOCIATED WITH ACUTE IMPROVEMENTS IN AFFECT IN A YOUNG-ADULT COLLEGE POPULATION. FUTURE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO EXAMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH DIFFERENT TYPES OF YOGA ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF DIFFERENT COLLEGE SUB-POPULATIONS (E.G., EATING DISORDERED, OVERWEIGHT/OBESE, SEDENTARY, AND SMOKERS).	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
14 2175  22 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON FUNCTIONALITY APPRECIATION AND ADDITIONAL FACETS OF POSITIVE BODY IMAGE. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON FUNCTIONALITY APPRECIATION, AND THE POTENTIAL MECHANISMS THAT COULD EXPLAIN THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON ADDITIONAL FACETS OF POSITIVE BODY IMAGE. YOUNG ADULT WOMEN (N=114; MAGE=22.19) WERE RANDOMISED TO A 10-WEEK HATHA YOGA PROGRAMME OR WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED MEASURES OF FUNCTIONALITY APPRECIATION, BODY APPRECIATION, BODY COMPASSION, APPEARANCE EVALUATION, SELF-OBJECTIFICATION, AND EMBODIMENT AT PRETEST, MIDTEST, POSTTEST, AND 1-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. FOLLOW-UP DATA COULD NOT BE ANALYSED DUE TO HIGH LEVELS OF ATTRITION. THE REMAINING DATA SHOWED THAT, COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP, WOMEN IN THE YOGA PROGRAMME EXPERIENCED LOWER SELF-OBJECTIFICATION AT MIDTEST AND GREATER EMBODIMENT OVER TIME. FURTHER, ALL PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCED IMPROVEMENTS IN BODY APPRECIATION, BODY COMPASSION, AND APPEARANCE EVALUATION OVER TIME, REGARDLESS OF THEIR ASSIGNED GROUP. LOWER SELF-OBJECTIFICATION CONTRIBUTED TO IMPROVEMENTS IN BODY APPRECIATION AND BODY COMPASSION. IN ADDITION, GREATER EMBODIMENT CONTRIBUTED TO IMPROVEMENTS IN BODY APPRECIATION, BODY COMPASSION, AND APPEARANCE EVALUATION. CONTRARY TO OUR EXPECTATIONS, YOGA DID NOT LEAD TO INCREASED FUNCTIONALITY APPRECIATION, NOR WAS FUNCTIONALITY APPRECIATION A MEDIATOR OF THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON POSITIVE BODY IMAGE. INSTEAD, LOWER SELF-OBJECTIFICATION, AND GREATER EMBODIMENT, DROVE IMPROVEMENTS IN POSITIVE BODY IMAGE.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
15 2370  26 WHAT BRINGS YOUNG ADULTS TO THE YOGA MAT? CROSS-SECTIONAL ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AND PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH AMONG PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROJECT EAT-IV SURVEY. OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY EXAMINES MOTIVATIONS FOR YOGA AND IDENTIFIES UNIQUE MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AMONG A SAMPLE OF YOUNG ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS. THIS STUDY FURTHER DETERMINES HOW YOUNG ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS' MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES ASSOCIATE WITH PHYSICAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS. SUBJECTS/SETTING: SURVEY DATA WERE DRAWN FROM THE FOURTH WAVE OF A LARGE, POPULATION-BASED STUDY (PROJECT EAT-IV; EATING AND ACTIVITY IN TEENS AND YOUNG ADULTS). DESIGN: LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS (LCA) WAS USED TO IDENTIFY MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AMONG PROJECT EAT-IV PARTICIPANTS PRACTICING YOGA (N = 297; MEAN AGE: 30.8-1.7 YEARS; 79.7 % FEMALE). CROSS-SECTIONAL ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN LATENT MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES, PHYSICAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS WERE DETERMINED WITH UNADJUSTED AND ADJUSTED (GENDER, RACE/ETHNICITY, AND BODY MASS INDEX) GENERAL LINEAR MODELS. RESULTS: ACROSS MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES, MOST YOUNG ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS WERE MOTIVATED BY ENHANCED FITNESS AND STRESS REDUCTION/RELAXATION. ADDITIONAL MOTIVATIONS FOR YOGA CLUSTERED BY APPEARANCE (DESIRE TO CHANGE BODY APPEARANCE OR WEIGHT) OR MINDFULNESS (DESIRE TO INCREASE PRESENT MOMENT AWARENESS) UNDERPINNINGS. THE LCA CHARACTERIZED MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AS "LOW APPEARANCE, LOW MINDFULNESS" (CLASS 1; N = 77), "LOW APPEARANCE, HIGH MINDFULNESS" (CLASS 2; N = 48), "HIGH APPEARANCE, LOW MINDFULNESS" (CLASS 3; N = 79), AND "HIGH APPEARANCE, HIGH MINDFULNESS" (CLASS 4; N = 93). HAVING A PROFILE WITH HIGH MINDFULNESS AND LOW APPEARANCE MOTIVATIONS (CLASS 2) WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER BODY SATISFACTION IN COMPARISON TO THE OTHER CLASSES (P < 0.001). RELATIVE TO CLASS 2, THOSE WITH LOW MINDFULNESS MOTIVATIONS (CLASS 1; CLASS 3) REPORTED LESS TOTAL PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (P = 0.002) AND THOSE WITH HIGH APPEARANCE MOTIVATIONS (CLASS 3; CLASS 4) REPORTED HIGHER COMPULSIVE EXERCISE SCORES (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: IN THIS SAMPLE, HIGH MINDFULNESS AND LOW APPEARANCE MOTIVATIONS FOR YOGA APPEARED OPTIMAL FOR PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH. CROSS-SECTIONAL FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOUNG ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS' MIND-BODY HEALTH MAY BE SUPPORTED BY MOTIVATIONAL UNDERPINNINGS THAT EMPHASIZE YOGA'S INTERNAL (MINDFULNESS) RATHER THAN EXTERNAL (APPEARANCE) BENEFITS.	2022	

16 2746  26 YOGA PRACTICE IN A COLLEGE SAMPLE: ASSOCIATED CHANGES IN EATING DISORDER, BODY IMAGE, AND RELATED FACTORS OVER TIME. YOGA PRACTICE IS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN EATING DISORDER (ED) SYMPTOMS AND BODY DISSATISFACTION. THIS STUDY CONTINUED TO EVALUATE THIS RELATIONSHIP WHILE ALSO ASSESSING CHANGES IN VARIABLES NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH ED SYMPTOMS (SELF-COMPASSION, MINDFULNESS, BODY APPRECIATION, SELF-EFFICACY) THAT ARE EMPHASIZED THROUGHOUT YOGA. MEN WERE ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS STUDY GIVEN STUDIES HAVE PREDOMINANTLY FOCUSED ON WOMEN. PARTICIPANTS (N = 99, 77.8% WOMEN) WERE RECRUITED FROM A UNIVERSITY-IMPLEMENTED YOGA COURSE AND COMPLETED ASSESSMENTS AT THE BEGINNING (TIME 1 (T1)) AND END (TIME 2 (T2)) OF AN EIGHT-WEEK YOGA COURSE MEETING THREE TIMES A WEEK FOR FIFTY MINUTES. BODY DISSATISFACTION (PS <.05) AND ED PATHOLOGY (P = .02) WERE LOWER AT T2. BODY APPRECIATION (P < .001), SELF-COMPASSION (P = .01), YOGA SELF-EFFICACY (P = .004) WERE HIGHER AT T2. SOME GENDER DIFFERENCES EMERGED. MEN REPORTED GREATER REDUCTIONS IN CONCERN WITH BEING OVERWEIGHT, (OVERWEIGHT PREOCCUPATION) FROM T1 (M = 2.46, SD = 0.61) TO T2 (M = 2.13, SD = 0.61) COMPARED TO WOMEN, T1 (M = 2.75, SD = 0.98) TO T2 (M = 2.69, SD = 0.97) ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA PRACTICE. MEN ALSO REPORTED GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN BODY SATISFACTION (APPEARANCE EVALUATION) FROM T1 (M = 3.60, SD = 0.49) TO T2 (M = 3.90, SD = 0.34) COMPARED WITH WOMEN, T1 (M = 3.48, SD = 0.58) TO T2 (M = 3.39, SD = 0.52) ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA PRACTICE. RESULTS SUGGEST YOGA MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH CONCURRENT CHANGES IN PROTECTIVE AND RISK FACTORS FOR ED IN A COLLEGE POPULATION.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
17 2376  26 WHO ENROLLS IN A QUIT SMOKING PROGRAM WITH YOGA THERAPY? OBJECTIVES: YOGA MAY IMPROVE STRESS, AFFECT, AND WEIGHT CONTROL, ALL OF WHICH ARE COMMONLY CITED BARRIERS TO QUITTING SMOKING. HOWEVER, THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE CONCERNS MAY VARY BY SEX, RACE, ETHNICITY, AND AGE. WE EXAMINED SMOKING-RELEVANT CHARACTERISTICS OF INDIVIDUALS ENROLLING IN AN 8-WEEK RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL TESTING YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT TO STANDARD SMOKING CESSATION. METHODS: OF 958 CALLERS, 227 WERE ELIGIBLE AND ENROLLED. RESULTS: THE SAMPLE WAS 55% FEMALE, 86% NON-HISPANIC WHITE, WITH A MEAN AGE OF 46 YEARS (SD = 12). MALES SMOKED MORE CIGARETTES/ DAY THAN FEMALES AND HAD LOWER MOTIVATION TO QUIT SMOKING. FEMALES WERE MORE LIKELY TO SMOKE FOR WEIGHT CONTROL, SOCIAL AND MOOD-RELATED REASONS, AND HAD HIGHER EXPECTATIONS FOR THE EFFICACY OF YOGA. AGE WAS NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRESENCE OF OTHER SMOKERS IN THE HOUSEHOLD, AND SMOKING IN RESPONSE TO NEGATIVE MOODS, AND WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH SMOKING RATE, AND CONFIDENCE IN QUITTING. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT BOTH MALES AND FEMALES WERE INTERESTED IN A PROGRAM OFFERING YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR SMOKING CESSATION. HOWEVER, THERE WERE BOTH SEX AND AGE-RELATED DIFFERENCES WITH RESPECT TO SMOKING-RELATED VARIABLES THAT MAY SUGGEST A NEED TO ADAPT THE INTERVENTION FOR SUB-POPULATIONS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
18  110  25 A PILOT STUDY MEASURING THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON THE TRAIT OF MINDFULNESS. BACKGROUND: THE CURRENT STUDY EXAMINED WHETHER YOGA WOULD INCREASE LEVELS OF MINDFULNESS IN A HEALTHY POPULATION. METHOD: FORTY-SIX PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP OR A WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP. MINDFULNESS WAS ASSESSED PRE AND POST YOGA, USING THE FREIBURG MINDFULNESS INVENTORY (FMI). RESULTS: RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE YOGA GROUP EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OVERALL MINDFULNESS, AND IN THREE MINDFULNESS SUBSCALES; ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT MOMENT, ACCEPTING AND OPEN ATTITUDES TOWARD EXPERIENCE, AND INSIGHTFUL UNDERSTANDING (P < .01). THE CONTROL GROUP EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OVERALL MINDFULNESS (P < .02) AND INSIGHTFUL UNDERSTANDING (P < .01). FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT A YOGA INTERVENTION MAY BE A VIABLE METHOD FOR INCREASING LEVELS OF TRAIT MINDFULNESS IN A HEALTHY POPULATION, POTENTIALLY IMPLICATING YOGA AS A PREVENTIVE METHOD FOR THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF NEGATIVE EMOTIONAL MOOD STATES (I.E. ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION). THE CONTROL GROUP ALSO EXPERIENCED MODERATE ELEVATIONS OF MINDFULNESS AT THE SECOND ASSESSMENT.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
19 1622  27 MINDFULNESS AND LEVELS OF STRESS: A COMPARISON OF BEGINNER AND ADVANCED HATHA YOGA PRACTITIONERS. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO EXAMINE MINDFULNESS AND STRESS LEVELS IN BEGINNER AND ADVANCED PRACTITIONERS OF HATHA YOGA. PARTICIPANTS (N = 52) WERE RECRUITED THROUGH HATHA YOGA SCHOOLS LOCAL TO WESTERN MASSACHUSETTS. BEGINNER PRACTITIONERS (N = 24) WERE DESIGNATED AS THOSE WITH UNDER 5 YEARS (M = 3.33) EXPERIENCE AND ADVANCED PRACTITIONERS (N = 28) AS THOSE WITH OVER 5 YEARS (M = 14.53) EXPERIENCE IN HATHA YOGA. THE PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE MINDFUL ATTENTION AWARENESS SCALE (MAAS; BROWN AND RYAN 2003) AND THE PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE (PSS; COHEN ET AL. 1983) DIRECTLY PRECEDING A REGULARLY SCHEDULED HATHA YOGA CLASS. BASED ON TWO INDEPENDENT-SAMPLES T-TESTS, ADVANCED PARTICIPANTS SCORED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN MINDFULNESS LEVELS (P < .05) AND SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN STRESS LEVELS (P < .05) WHEN COMPARED TO BEGINNER PARTICIPANTS. ADDITIONALLY, A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE CORRELATION (R = -.45, P = .00) WAS FOUND BETWEEN MINDFULNESS AND STRESS LEVELS. NO SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS WERE FOUND BETWEEN EXPERIENCE LEVELS AND MINDFULNESS AND STRESS LEVELS. HATHA YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE TECHNIQUE FOR ENHANCING MINDFULNESS AND DECREASING STRESS LEVELS IN PRACTITIONERS.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
20 2419  20 YOGA AND MENTAL HEALTH AMONG BRAZILIAN PRACTITIONERS DURING COVID-19: AN INTERNET-BASED CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY. THIS STUDY AIMED TO DESCRIBE YOGA PRACTICE AND VERIFY ITS ASSOCIATION WITH DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND STRESS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AMONG BRAZILIAN PRACTITIONERS. A CROSS-SECTIONAL ANONYMOUS ONLINE SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED IN ALL REGIONS OF BRAZIL USING A SNOWBALL SAMPLING STRATEGY AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS. A TOTAL OF 860 PARTICIPANTS (87% FEMALE, AGED: 19-82 YEARS) COMPLETED THE SURVEY. SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC DATA, LIFESTYLE FACTORS, YOGA PRACTICE DURING THE PANDEMIC, AND THE DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND STRESS SCALE (DASS-21) SCORES WERE COLLECTED BETWEEN JULY 9 AND JULY 15, 2021. OVERALL, 9.5%, 9.3%, AND 5.6% OF PARTICIPANTS EXHIBITED SOME TRAITS (MILD TO SEVERE) OF DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND STRESS, RESPECTIVELY. HATHA YOGA (48%) WAS THE MOST COMMONLY PRACTICED YOGA STYLE. IN THE ADJUSTED ANALYSIS, A HIGHER YOGA EXPERIENCE (> 5 YEARS) WAS ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER ANXIETY (ODDS RATIO; BOOTSTRAP 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL: 2.42; 1.32, 4.49) AND STRESS STATUS (1.80; 1.06, 3.00) THAN BEGINNERS (< 1 YEAR). PRACTITIONERS WHO REPORTED HIGHER TIME AND DAYS OF YOGA PRACTICE DURING THE STUDY PERIOD WERE MORE LIKELY TO SHOW NORMAL LEVELS OF DEPRESSION (ODDS RATIO: 2.56-6.49; P < 0.05), ANXIETY (ODDS RATIO: 3.68-8.84; P < 0.05), AND STRESS (ODDS RATIO: 2.15-5.21; P < 0.05). MOREOVER, THE MAINTENANCE OF PRACTICE FREQUENCY DURING THE PANDEMIC WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER ODDS OF NORMAL LEVELS OF DEPRESSION (2.27; 1.39-3.79), ANXIETY (1.97; 1.25-3.10), AND STRESS (1.97; 1.32-2.96). IN CONCLUSION, OUR FINDINGS INDICATED THAT A HIGHER LEVEL OF YOGA PRACTICE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER MENTAL HEALTH LEVELS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.	2022

1  648 153 DYADIC YOGA PROGRAM FOR PATIENTS UNDERGOING THORACIC RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS: RESULTS OF A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: THORACIC RADIOTHERAPY (TRT) MAY RESULT IN TOXICITIES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH PERFORMANCE DECLINES AND POOR QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) FOR PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS TO ESTABLISH FEASIBILITY AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF A DYADIC YOGA (DY) INTERVENTION AS A SUPPORTIVE CARE STRATEGY. METHODS: PATIENTS WITH STAGE I TO III NON-SMALL CELL LUNG OR ESOPHAGEAL CANCER UNDERGOING TRT AND THEIR CAREGIVERS (N = 26 DYADS) WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 15-SESSION DY OR A WAITLIST CONTROL (WLC) GROUP. PRIOR TO TRT AND RANDOMIZATION, BOTH GROUPS COMPLETED MEASURES OF QOL (SF-36) AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (CES-D). PATIENTS ALSO COMPLETED THE 6-MINUTE WALK TEST (6MWT). DYADS WERE REASSESSED ON THE LAST DAY OF TRT AND 3 MONTHS LATER. RESULTS: A PRIORI FEASIBILITY CRITERIA WERE MET REGARDING CONSENT (68%), ADHERENCE (80%), AND RETENTION (81%) RATES. CONTROLLING FOR RELEVANT COVARIATES, MULTILEVEL MODELING ANALYSES REVEALED SIGNIFICANT CLINICAL IMPROVEMENTS FOR PATIENTS IN THE DY GROUP COMPARED WITH THE WLC GROUP FOR THE 6MWT (MEANS: DY = 473 M VS WLC = 397 M, D = 1.19) AND SF-36 PHYSICAL FUNCTION (MEANS: DY = 38.77 VS WLC = 30.88; D = .66) AND SOCIAL FUNCTION (MEANS: DY = 45.24 VS WLC = 39.09; D = .44) ACROSS THE FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. CAREGIVERS IN THE DY GROUP REPORTED MARGINALLY CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN SF-36 VITALITY (MEANS: DY = 53.05 VS WLC = 48.84; D = .39) AND ROLE PERFORMANCE (MEANS: DY = 52.78 VS WLC = 48.59; D = .51) RELATIVE TO THOSE IN THE WLC GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: THIS NOVEL SUPPORTIVE CARE PROGRAM APPEARS TO BE FEASIBLE AND BENEFICIAL FOR PATIENTS UNDERGOING TRT AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. A LARGER EFFICACY TRIAL WITH A MORE STRINGENT CONTROL GROUP IS WARRANTED.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
2 1748  84 PILOT RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL OF A DYADIC YOGA PROGRAM FOR GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS. BACKGROUND: WHILE THE USE OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE IN MANAGING GLIOMA PATIENTS' SYMPTOMS IS NOT WELL STUDIED, THE HIGH SYMPTOM BURDEN IN PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS IS WELL ESTABLISHED. WE CONDUCTED A PILOT RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF A DYADIC YOGA (DY) INTERVENTION AS A SUPPORTIVE CARE STRATEGY. METHODS: GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 12-SESSION DY OR WAITLIST CONTROL (WLC) GROUP. PRIOR TO RADIOTHERAPY AND RANDOMIZATION, BOTH GROUPS COMPLETED MEASURES OF CANCER-RELATED SYMPTOMS (MD ANDERSON SYMPTOM INVENTORY-BRAIN TUMOR MODULE), DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (CENTER FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES-DEPRESSION MEASURE), FATIGUE (BRIEF FATIGUE INVENTORY), AND OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL; MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY 36-ITEM SHORT-FORM SURVEY). DYADS WERE REASSESSED AT THE LAST DAY OF RADIOTHERAPY. RESULTS: TWENTY PATIENTS (MEAN AGE: 46 YEARS, 50% FEMALE, 80% WHO GRADE IV AND CAREGIVERS (MEAN AGE: 50 YEARS, 70% FEMALE, 50% SPOUSES) PARTICIPATED IN THE TRIAL. A PRIORI FEASIBILITY CRITERIA WERE MET REGARDING CONSENT (70%), ADHERENCE (88%), AND RETENTION (95%) RATES. CONTROLLING FOR RELEVANT COVARIATES, CHANGE SCORE ANALYSES REVEALED CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS FOR PATIENTS IN THE DY COMPARED WITH THE WLC GROUP FOR OVERALL CANCER SYMPTOM SEVERITY (D = 0.96) AND SYMPTOM INTERFERENCE (D = 0.74), DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (D = 0.71), AND MENTAL QOL (D = 0.69). CAREGIVERS IN THE DY GROUP REPORTED CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (D = 1.12), FATIGUE (D = 0.89), AND MENTAL QOL (D = 0.49) RELATIVE TO THOSE IN THE WLC GROUP. CONCLUSION: A DY INTERVENTION APPEARS TO BE A FEASIBLE AND BENEFICIAL SYMPTOM AND QOL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. AN EFFICACY TRIAL WITH A MORE STRINGENT CONTROL GROUP IS WARRANTED.

3  199  53 A RESEARCH PROTOCOL FOR A PILOT, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL DESIGNED TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF A DYADIC VERSUS INDIVIDUAL YOGA PROGRAM FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS OF GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY. BACKGROUND: ALTHOUGH THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF A PRIMARY BRAIN TUMOR PRESENT UNIQUE CHALLENGES TO PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS, EVIDENCE-BASED SUPPORTIVE CARE INTERVENTIONS ARE GENERALLY LACKING. THE PRIMARY AIM OF THIS RESEARCH PROTOCOL IS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING A DYADIC YOGA (DY) VERSUS A CAREGIVER YOGA (CY) INTERVENTION OR A WAIT-LIST CONTROL (WLC) GROUP USING A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL DESIGN. METHODS: SEVENTY-FIVE GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS ARE RANDOMIZED TO THE DY, CY, OR A WLC GROUP. PATIENT-CAREGIVER DYADS IN THE DY GROUP AND CAREGIVERS IN THE CY GROUP RECEIVE 15 SESSIONS (45 MIN EACH) OVER THE COURSE OF PATIENTS' STANDARD RADIOTHERAPY (6 WEEKS). PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS IN ALL GROUPS COMPLETE BASELINE ASSESSMENTS OF SYMPTOMS, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), AND HEALTH UTILIZATION OUTCOMES PRIOR TO RANDOMIZATION. FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENTS ARE PERFORMED 6 WEEKS AND THEN AGAIN 3 MONTHS LATER. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME IS FEASIBILITY (I.E., >/= 50% OF ELIGIBLE DYADS CONSENT, >/= 70% OF ENROLLED DYADS COMPLETE ALL ASSESSMENTS, AND >/= 50% OF ALL PRACTICE SESSIONS ARE ATTENDED). WE WILL ALSO PERFORM PRIMARILY DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSES OF THE SELF-REPORTED OUTCOMES (E.G., FATIGUE, OVERALL QOL) AND EXPLORE POTENTIAL INTERVENTION MODERATORS (E.G., PERFORMANCE STATUS) TO INFORM A LARGER FUTURE TRIAL. CONCLUSION: THIS TRIAL WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING THE FEASIBILITY OF A DYADIC VERSUS A CAREGIVER YOGA INTERVENTION REGARDING SYMPTOM, QOL, AND HEALTH UTILIZATION OUTCOMES IN GLIOMA PATIENTS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS.

4 2867  25 YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE TREATMENT AND COMPOSITE TREATMENT GOALS IN TYPE 2 DIABETES IN A RURAL SOUTH INDIAN SETUP- A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY. THIS MULTICENTRE RETROSPECTIVE STUDY EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF ADJUNCT YOGA-TREATMENT IN ACHIEVING COMPOSITE CARDIOVASCULAR GOALS FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES (T2D), SET FORTH BY THE AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION (ADA) IN RURAL INDIAN SETTINGS. RECORDS WERE EXTRACTED FOR 146 T2D PATIENTS, AGED >/=20-70 YEARS, AND TREATED UNDER THE "APOLLO TOTAL HEALTH PROGRAMME" FOR RURAL DIABETES MANAGEMENT, FOR THE PERIOD APRIL 2016 TO NOVEMBER 2016. THE STUDY COHORT COMPRISED OF TWO TREATMENT GROUPS (N = 73 EACH); NON-YOGA GROUP (STANDARD OF CARE) AND YOGA GROUP (ADJUNCT YOGA-TREATMENT). PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING WAS APPLIED BETWEEN THE STUDY GROUPS TO DEFINE THE COHORT. COMPOSITE CARDIOVASCULAR SCORES WERE BASED ON THE COMBINATION OF INDIVIDUAL ADA GOALS; A1C < 7%, BLOOD PRESSURE (BP) < 140/90 MMHG, STRINGENT BP (<130/80 MMHG) AND LIPID, LDL-C < 100 MG/DL [RISK FACTOR FOR ATHEROSCLEROTIC CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE]. LOGISTIC REGRESSION WAS USED TO COMPARE BETWEEN THE TWO TREATMENT GROUPS. COMPARED TO STANDARD OF CARE, ADJUNCT YOGA-TREATMENT WAS FOUND TO SIGNIFICANTLY FACILITATE THE ATTAINMENT OF ADA COMPOSITE SCORE BY 8-FOLD; A1C, ~2-FOLD; LDL-C, ~2-FOLD; BP < 140/90 MMHG AND <130/80 MMHG BY ~8-AND ~6-FOLD RESPECTIVELY. THIS STUDY PROVIDES THE FIRST EVIDENCE FOR SIGNIFICANT EFFICACY OF ADJUNCT YOGA-TREATMENT FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF FAVOURABLE TREATMENT GOALS FOR T2D IN RURAL INDIAN SETTINGS.

5 1568  17 MAINSTREAMING OF AYURVEDA, YOGA, NATUROPATHY, UNANI, SIDDHA, AND HOMEOPATHY WITH THE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN INDIA. INDIA HAS A POPULATION OF 1.21 BILLION PEOPLE AND THERE IS A HIGH DEGREE OF SOCIO-CULTURAL, LINGUISTIC, AND DEMOGRAPHIC HETEROGENEITY. THERE IS A LIMITED NUMBER OF HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS, ESPECIALLY DOCTORS, PER HEAD OF POPULATION. THE NATIONAL RURAL HEALTH MISSION HAS DECIDED TO MAINSTREAM THE AYURVEDA, YOGA, NATUROPATHY, UNANI, SIDDHA, AND HOMEOPATHY (AYUSH) SYSTEM OF INDIGENOUS MEDICINE TO HELP MEET THE CHALLENGE OF THIS SHORTAGE OF HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS AND TO STRENGTHEN THE DELIVERY SYSTEM OF THE HEALTH CARE SERVICE. MULTIPLE INTERVENTIONS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED TO ENSURE A SYSTEMATIC MERGER; HOWEVER, THE ANTICIPATED RESULTS HAVE NOT BEEN ACHIEVED AS A RESULT OF MULTIPLE CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS. TO ENSURE THE ACCESSIBILITY AND AVAILABILITY OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO ALL, POLICY-MAKERS NEED TO IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES TO FACILITATE THE MAINSTREAMING OF THE AYUSH SYSTEM AND TO SUPPORT THIS SYSTEM WITH STRINGENT MONITORING MECHANISMS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
6 2039  42 TESTING THE EFFICACY OF YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR SMOKING CESSATION: DESIGN AND METHODS OF THE BREATHEASY TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: SMOKERS TRYING TO QUIT ENCOUNTER MANY CHALLENGES INCLUDING NICOTINE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS, CIGARETTE CRAVING, INCREASED STRESS AND NEGATIVE MOOD AND CONCERN REGARDING WEIGHT GAIN. THESE PHENOMENA MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO SUCCESSFULLY QUIT SMOKING. STUDIES IN NON-SMOKING POPULATIONS SHOW THAT YOGA REDUCES STRESS AND NEGATIVE MOOD AND IMPROVES WEIGHT CONTROL. BY INCREASING MINDFULNESS WE ANTICIPATE THAT YOGA MAY ALSO IMPROVE SMOKERS' ABILITY TO COPE WITH THE NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH QUITTING. YOGA MAY ALSO IMPROVE COGNITIVE DELIBERATION WHICH IS NEEDED TO MAKE EFFECTIVE CHOICES AND AVOID SMOKING IN TEMPTING SITUATIONS. METHODS/DESIGN: THE BREATHEASY STUDY IS A RIGOROUS, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL EXAMINING THE EFFICACY OF IYENGAR YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY TO COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR SMOKING CESSATION. ALL PARTICIPANTS ARE GIVEN AN 8-WEEK PROGRAM OF SMOKING CESSATION CLASSES, AND ARE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER TWICE WEEKLY YOGA (YOGA) OR TWICE-WEEKLY HEALTH AND WELLNESS CLASSES WHICH SERVE AS A CONTROL FOR CONTACT AND PARTICIPANT BURDEN (CTL). ASSESSMENTS ARE CONDUCTED AT BASELINE, 8 WEEKS, 3, 6, AND 12 MONTHS OF FOLLOW-UP. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME IS PROLONGED ABSTINENCE USING AN INTENTION-TO-TREAT APPROACH. MULTIPLE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL AUDITS USING BLIND DATA COLLECTION ARE EMPLOYED TO ENSURE TREATMENT FIDELITY AND RELIABILITY OF STUDY RESULTS. TO UNDERSTAND WHY YOGA MAY BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN CTL, WE WILL EXAMINE THE MECHANISMS OF ACTION (I.E., MEDIATORS) UNDERLYING INTERVENTION EFFICACY. WE WILL EXAMINE THE MAINTENANCE OF YOGA PRACTICE AND SMOKING STATUS AT EACH FOLLOW-UP. FOCUS GROUPS AND INTERVIEWS WILL BE USED TO ENRICH OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF YOGA PRACTICE AND SMOKING ABSTINENCE. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY WILL PROVIDE A STRINGENT TEST OF THE RELATIVE EFFICACY OF YOGA COMPARED TO A CONDITION THAT CONTROLS FOR CONTACT TIME AND ATTENTION. THE USE OF MIXED METHODOLOGY ALSO PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY TO VALIDATE EXISTING KNOWLEDGE ABOUT YOGA AND HELPS TO EXPLORE NEW THEMES FOR FUTURE MINDFULNESS AND YOGA RESEARCH.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                        
7  349  27 ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT FOR POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER: A REVIEW AND SYNTHESIS. OBJECTIVES: POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) IS A DEBILITATING CONDITION THAT AFFECTS MANY WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED TRAUMA. IN ADDITION TO SKILLS-FOCUSED TREATMENTS, EXPOSURE-BASED TREATMENTS, COGNITIVE THERAPY, COMBINATION TREATMENTS, AND EMDR, A NUMBER OF ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS FOR PTSD HAVE EMERGED IN RECENT YEARS. THE SEARCH FOR ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS IS JUSTIFIED BASED ON THE EMPIRICAL OBSERVATION THAT A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF INDIVIDUALS FAIL TO BENEFIT OPTIMALLY FROM EXISTING TREATMENTS (E.G., BETWEEN 30 AND 60). MOREOVER, CURRENT STUDIES OFTEN UTILIZE STRINGENT INCLUSION CRITERIA (E.G., ABSENCE OF COMORBID DISORDERS), RAISING THE LIKELIHOOD THAT RESULTS WILL NOT GENERALIZE TO MANY INDIVIDUALS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING PTSD. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE CURRENT PAPER WAS TO EXPLORE THE EFFECTS OF ONE TYPE OF ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT: YOGA. DESIGN: A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE WAS CONDUCTED TARGETING RESEARCH EXAMINING YOGA POSTURES AND PTSD. SEVEN RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) WERE IDENTIFIED AND REVIEWED, AND EFFECT SIZES WERE COMPUTED FOR THE POST-TEST ASSESSMENTS. RESULTS: COHEN'S D FOR EACH STUDY RANGED (IN ABSOLUTE VALUE) FROM A LOW OF -0.06 TO A HIGH OF 1.42 (AVERAGE WEIGHTED D ACROSS STUDIES WAS 0.48; 95% CI: 0.26, 0.69).

BACKGROUND: DESPITE THEIR HIGH SYMPTOM BURDEN AND POOR PROGNOSIS, EVIDENCE-BASED SUPPORTIVE CARE INTERVENTIONS FOR ADULTS WITH HIGH-GRADE GLIOMA (HGG) AND THEIR CAREGIVERS ARE LACKING. THUS, WE AIMED TO ESTABLISH FEASIBILITY OF A PATIENT-CAREGIVER DYADIC YOGA PROGRAM (DYP) FOR NEWLY DIAGNOSED HGG PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS TARGETING QUALITY-OF-LIFE (QOL) OUTCOMES. METHOD: IN THIS SINGLE-ARM PILOT TRIAL, DYADS PARTICIPATED IN A 12-SESSION DYP PROGRAM ACROSS THE COURSE OF PATIENTS' RADIOTHERAPY. THE INTERVENTION FOCUSED ON BREATHING EXERCISES, GENTLE MOVEMENTS, AND GUIDED MEDITATIONS. WE TRACKED FEASIBILITY DATA AND ASSESSED LEVELS OF CANCER-RELATED SYMPTOMS (MD ANDERSON SYMPTOM INVENTORY [MDASI]), DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (CENTERS FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES-DEPRESSION SCALE), FATIGUE (BRIEF FATIGUE INVENTORY), SLEEP DISTURBANCES (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX [PSQI]), AND OVERALL MENTAL AND PHYSICAL QOL (36-ITEM SHORT-FORM SURVEY [SF-36]) AT BASELINE AND POST-DYP, WHICH WAS AT THE END OF RADIOTHERAPY. RESULTS: WE APPROACHED 6 DYADS OF WHICH 5 DYADS (86%) CONSENTED AND COMPLETED ALL 12 SESSIONS AND PRE/POST ASSESSMENTS. ALL PATIENTS (MEAN AGE: 52 YEARS, 80% FEMALE, 80% GRADE IV) AND CAREGIVERS (MEAN AGE: 58 YEARS, 80% FEMALE, 60% SPOUSES) PERCEIVED BENEFIT FROM THE PROGRAM. PAIRED T TESTS REVEALED A MARGINALLY SIGNIFICANT, YET CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL, DECREASE IN PATIENT'S CANCER SYMPTOMS ( T = 2.32, P = .08; MDASI MEAN; PRE = 1.75, POST = 1.04). THERE WERE CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN PATIENT SLEEP DISTURBANCES (PSQI MEAN: PRE = 10.75, POST = 8.00) AND IMPROVEMENTS IN PATIENT AND CAREGIVER MENTAL QOL (MCS OF SF-36 MEAN: PRE = 42.35, POST = 52.34, AND PRE = 45.14, POST = 51.43, RESPECTIVELY). CONCLUSIONS: THIS NOVEL SUPPORTIVE CARE PROGRAM APPEARS TO BE SAFE, FEASIBLE, ACCEPTABLE, AND SUBJECTIVELY USEFUL FOR HGG PATIENTS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. THERE WAS ALSO PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE REGARDING QOL TREATMENT GAINS FOR BOTH PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
9  484  23 CLINICAL EVALUATION OF THE EFFICACY OF KHADIRADI YOGA AVACHOORNANA IN KACHCHU WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO GENITOINGUINAL INTERTRIGO. KACHCHU IS A SIMPLE LOCALIZED DERMATOLOGICAL INFECTION OF THE GENITOINGUINAL REGION, WHICH OCCURS BECAUSE OF UNHYGIENIC OBSERVANCE, AND MANIFESTS IN THE FORM OF INFLAMMATION FOLLOWED BY SECONDARY BACTERIAL OR FUNGAL INFECTIONS THAT CAN BE BEST CORRELATED TO GENITOINGUINAL INTERTRIGO. EVEN THOUGH IT RARELY CAUSES SYSTEMIC MANIFESTATIONS, ITS MERE PRESENCE ITSELF IS DISTURBING BECAUSE OF INTRACTABLE ITCHING AND PAIN. IT MAY DELAY THE PROPER HEALING OF THE EPISIOTOMY WOUND AND MAY CAUSE DIFFICULTY IN WALKING BECAUSE OF SEVERE PAIN. CANDIDA POWDER IS THE HIGHEST SELLING MEDICINE FOR THE INTERTRIGO, AS THE INCIDENCE OF INTERTRIGO IS AS HIGH AS 40% IN SOME PARTICULAR SEASONS. IN THE AYURVEDA FRATERNITY, THERE IS NO ESTABLISHED PREPARATION THAT CAN BE PRESERVED SAFELY IN ALL THE EPOCHS OF LIFE IN FEMALES AND WHICH IS EASY TO APPLY. AFTER UNDERSTANDING THE DISEASE IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE AYURVEDIC AND MODERN MEDICINAL SYSTEMS, KHADIRADI YOGA CHOORNA - A NEW AYURVEDIC FORMULATION - WAS PREPARED ON THE BASIS OF STRINGENT AYURVEDIC PRINCIPLES. HENCE, AN ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE TO STUDY THE EFFICACY OF THE KHADIRADI YOGA AVACHURNANA(1) IN KACHCHU, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO GENITOINGUINAL INTERTRIGO IN FEMALES.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
10 2455  40 YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR SMOKING CESSATION: RESULTS FROM BREATHEASY, A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT YOGA MAY BE HELPFUL AS AN AID FOR SMOKING CESSATION. YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE STRESS AND NEGATIVE MOOD AND MAY AID WEIGHT CONTROL, ALL OF WHICH HAVE PROVEN TO BE BARRIERS TO QUITTING SMOKING. THIS STUDY IS THE FIRST RIGOROUS, RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL OF YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR SMOKERS ATTEMPTING TO QUIT. METHODS: ADULT SMOKERS (N = 227; 55.5% WOMEN) WERE RANDOMIZED TO AN 8-WEEK PROGRAM OF COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL SMOKING CESSATION AND EITHER TWICE-WEEKLY IYENGAR YOGA OR GENERAL WELLNESS CLASSES (CONTROL). ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED COTININE-VERIFIED 7-DAY POINT PREVALENCE ABSTINENCE AT WEEK 8, 3-MONTH, AND 6-MONTH FOLLOW-UPS. RESULTS: AT BASELINE, PARTICIPANTS' MEAN AGE WAS 46.2 (SD = 12.0) YEARS AND SMOKING RATE WAS 17.3 (SD = 7.6) CIGARETTES/DAY. LONGITUDINALLY ADJUSTED MODELS OF ABSTINENCE OUTCOMES DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT GROUP EFFECTS FAVORING YOGA. YOGA PARTICIPANTS HAD 37% GREATER ODDS OF ACHIEVING ABSTINENCE THAN WELLNESS PARTICIPANTS AT THE END OF TREATMENT (EOT). LOWER BASELINE SMOKING RATES (</=10 CIGARETTES/DAY) WERE ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF QUITTING IF GIVEN YOGA VERSUS WELLNESS (OR = 2.43, 95% CI = 1.09% TO 6.30%) CLASSES AT EOT. A SIGNIFICANT DOSE EFFECT WAS OBSERVED FOR YOGA (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.09% TO 1.26%), BUT NOT WELLNESS, SUCH THAT EACH YOGA CLASS ATTENDED INCREASED QUITTING ODDS AT EOT BY 12%. LATENT CLASS MODELING REVEALED A 4-CLASS MODEL OF DISTINCT QUITTING PATTERNS AMONG PARTICIPANTS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA APPEARS TO INCREASE THE ODDS OF SUCCESSFUL SMOKING ABSTINENCE, PARTICULARLY AMONG LIGHT SMOKERS. ADDITIONAL WORK IS NEEDED TO IDENTIFY PREDICTORS OF QUITTING PATTERNS AND INFORM ADJUSTMENTS TO THERAPY NEEDED TO ACHIEVE CESSATION AND PREVENT RELAPSE. IMPLICATIONS: THIS STUDY ADDS TO OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE TYPES OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THAT AID SMOKING CESSATION. YOGA INCREASES THE ODDS OF SUCCESSFUL SMOKING ABSTINENCE, AND DOES SO IN A DOSE-RESPONSE MANNER. THIS STUDY ALSO REVEALED FOUR DISTINCT PATTERNS OF SMOKING BEHAVIOR AMONG PARTICIPANTS RELEVANT TO QUITTING SMOKING. ADDITIONAL WORK IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE WHETHER VARIABLES THAT ARE PREDICTIVE OF THESE QUITTING PATTERNS CAN BE IDENTIFIED, WHICH MIGHT SUGGEST MODIFICATIONS TO THERAPY FOR THOSE WHO ARE UNABLE TO QUIT.	2019	

11 2360  32 VIDEOCONFERENCED YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR CANCER PATIENTS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: A REPORT FROM A CLINICIAN'S PERSPECTIVE. BACKGROUND: THE ACCEPTABILITY OF VIDEOCONFERENCING DELIVERY OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN THE ADVANCED CANCER SETTING IS RELATIVELY UNEXPLORED. THE CURRENT REPORT SUMMARIZES THE CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS OF THE TRANSITION FROM AN IN-PERSON (IE, FACE-TO-FACE) TO A VIDEOCONFERENCE INTERVENTION DELIVERY APPROACH IN RESPONSE TO THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE PANDEMIC. METHOD: PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED PATIENT-FAMILY CAREGIVER DYADS WHO WERE ENROLLED IN ONGOING YOGA TRIALS AND 2 CERTIFIED YOGA THERAPISTS WHO DELIVERED THE YOGA SESSIONS. WE SUMMARIZED THEIR EXPERIENCES USING RECORDINGS OF THE YOGA SESSIONS AND INTERVENTIONISTS' PROGRESS NOTES. RESULTS: OUT OF 7 DYADS PARTICIPATING IN THE PARENT TRIAL, 1 DECLINED THE VIDEOCONFERENCED SESSIONS. PARTICIPANTS WERE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 55 AND 76 AND MOSTLY NON-HISPANIC WHITE (83%). PATIENTS WERE MAINLY MALE (83%), ALL HAD STAGE III OR IV CANCER AND WERE UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY. CAREGIVERS WERE ALL FEMALE. DESPITE CHALLENGES IN THE AREAS OF TECHNOLOGY, LOCATION, AND SETTING, INSTRUCTION AND PERSONAL CONNECTION, THE OVERALL ACCEPTABILITY WAS HIGH AMONG PATIENTS, CAREGIVERS, AND INSTRUCTORS. THROUGH THIS TRANSITION PROCESS, SOLUTIONS TO THESE CHALLENGES WERE FOUND, WHICH ARE DESCRIBED HERE. CONCLUSION: ALTHOUGH IN-PERSON INTERVENTIONS ARE FAVORED BY BOTH THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS AND THE INTERVENTIONISTS, VIDEOCONFERENCE SESSIONS WERE DEEMED ACCEPTABLE. ALL PARTICIPANTS HAD THE BENEFIT OF A PREVIOUS IN-PERSON EXPERIENCE, WHICH WAS HELPFUL AND PERHAPS NECESSARY FOR OLDER AND ADVANCED CANCER PATIENTS REQUIRING PRACTICE MODIFICATIONS. IN A REMOTE SETTING, THE ASSISTANCE OF CAREGIVERS SEEMS PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL TO ENSURE PRACTICE SAFETY.

12 2457  34 YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR SMOKING CESSATION: RATIONALE, STUDY DESIGN AND PARTICIPANT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE QUITTING-IN-BALANCE STUDY. BACKGROUND: TOBACCO SMOKING REMAINS THE LEADING PREVENTABLE CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG AMERICAN WOMEN. EXERCISE HAS SHOWN PROMISE AS AN AID TO SMOKING CESSATION BECAUSE IT REDUCES WEIGHT GAIN AND WEIGHT CONCERNS, IMPROVES AFFECT, AND REDUCES NICOTINE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS AND CIGARETTE CRAVING. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE PRACTICE OF YOGA IMPROVES WEIGHT CONTROL, AND REDUCES PERCEIVED STRESS AND NEGATIVE AFFECT. YOGA PRACTICE ALSO INCLUDES REGULATION OF BREATHING AND FOCUSED ATTENTION, BOTH OF WHICH MAY ENHANCE STRESS REDUCTION AND IMPROVE MOOD AND WELL-BEING AND MAY IMPROVE CESSATION OUTCOMES. METHODS/DESIGN: THIS PILOT EFFICACY STUDY IS DESIGNED TO EXAMINE THE RATES OF CESSATION AMONG WOMEN RANDOMIZED TO EITHER A NOVEL, 8-WEEK YOGA PLUS COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT) SMOKING CESSATION INTERVENTION VERSUS A WELLNESS PROGRAM PLUS THE SAME CBT SMOKING CESSATION INTERVENTION. OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDE 7-DAY POINT PREVALENCE ABSTINENCE AT END OF TREATMENT, 3 AND 6 MONTHS FOLLOW UP AND POTENTIAL MEDIATING VARIABLES (E.G., CONFIDENCE IN QUITTING SMOKING, SELF-EFFICACY). OTHER ASSESSMENTS INCLUDE MEASURES OF MINDFULNESS, SPIRITUALITY, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, ANXIETY AND PERCEIVED HEALTH (SF-36). DISCUSSION: INNOVATIVE TREATMENTS ARE NEEDED THAT ADDRESS BARRIERS TO SUCCESSFUL SMOKING CESSATION AMONG MEN AND WOMEN. THE DESIGN CHOSEN FOR THIS STUDY WILL ALLOW US TO EXPLORE POTENTIAL MEDIATORS OF INTERVENTION EFFICACY SO THAT WE MAY BETTER UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISM(S) BY WHICH YOGA MAY ACT AS AN EFFECTIVE COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR SMOKING CESSATION. IF SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE, YOGA CAN OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL EXERCISE FOR REDUCING NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS THAT OFTEN ACCOMPANY SMOKING CESSATION AND PREDICT RELAPSE TO SMOKING AMONG RECENT QUITTERS.

13 2361  54 VIVEKANANDA YOGA PROGRAM FOR PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED LUNG CANCER AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS. BACKGROUND: THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ESTABLISH THE FEASIBILITY OF A COUPLE-BASED VIVEKANANDA YOGA (VKC) INTERVENTION IN LUNG CANCER PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS. SECONDLY, WE EXAMINED PRELIMINARY EFFICACY REGARDING QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) OUTCOMES. METHOD: IN THIS SINGLE-ARM FEASIBILITY TRIAL, PATIENTS WITH LUNG CANCER UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS PARTICIPATED IN A 15-SESSION VKC PROGRAM THAT FOCUSED ON THE INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF THE DYAD. WE ASSESSED PRE-AND POST-INTERVENTION LEVELS OF FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCES, PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, OVERALL QOL, SPIRITUALITY, AND RELATIONAL CLOSENESS. WE TRACKED FEASIBILITY DATA, AND PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED PROGRAM EVALUATIONS. RESULTS: WE APPROACHED 28 ELIGIBLE DYADS OF WHICH 15 (53%) CONSENTED AND 9 (60%) COMPLETED THE INTERVENTION. PATIENTS (MEAN AGE = 73 YEARS, 63% FEMALE, ALL STAGE III) AND CAREGIVERS (MEAN AGE = 62 YEARS, 38% FEMALE, 63% SPOUSES) COMPLETED A MEAN OF 10 SESSIONS AND 95.5% OF THEM RATED THE PROGRAM AS VERY USEFUL. PAIRED T TESTS REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PATIENTS' MENTAL HEALTH (D = 0.84; P = .04) AND A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN CAREGIVERS' SLEEP DISTURBANCES (D = 1.44; P = .02). ALTHOUGH NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT, FOR PATIENTS, EFFECT SIZES FOR CHANGE SCORES WERE MEDIUM FOR BENEFIT FINDING AND SMALL FOR DISTRESS (D = 0.65 AND 0.37, RESPECTIVELY). FOR CAREGIVERS, MEDIUM EFFECTS WERE FOUND FOR IMPROVEMENT IN PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING (D = 0.50). CONCLUSION: THIS NOVEL SUPPORTIVE CARE PROGRAM APPEARS TO BE SAFE, FEASIBLE, ACCEPTABLE, AND SUBJECTIVELY USEFUL FOR LUNG CANCER PATIENTS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS AND LENDS SUPPORT FOR FURTHER STUDY.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
14 2046  38 THE ACUTE IMPACT OF HATHA YOGA ON CRAVING AMONG SMOKERS ATTEMPTING TO REDUCE OR QUIT. INTRODUCTION: DESPITE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF SMOKING, SMOKERS HAVE DIFFICULTY QUITTING, SUGGESTING A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL STRATEGIES TO HELP THEM QUIT. A SINGLE-SESSION HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION ACUTELY REDUCED CRAVING AMONG NICOTINE-DEPRIVED SMOKERS NOT ATTEMPTING TO REDUCE OR QUIT, YET IT IS UNKNOWN IF IT REDUCES CRAVING AMONG THOSE ATTEMPTING TO CHANGE THEIR SMOKING. THUS, THIS STUDY TESTED THE EFFICACY OF A SINGLE-SESSION HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION FOR ACUTELY REDUCING CRAVING AMONG SMOKERS ATTEMPTING TO REDUCE OR QUIT SMOKING. METHODS: DATA PRESENTED ARE PART OF A LARGER DISSERTATION PROJECT. PARTICIPANTS WERE 55 COMMUNITY-RECRUITED SMOKERS (62% MALE) MOTIVATED TO REDUCE OR QUIT SMOKING RANDOMIZED TO ONE SESSION OF HATHA YOGA (N = 25) OR WELLNESS CONTROL (IE, READING EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS ABOUT HEALTHY LIFESTYLE; N = 30) ON THEIR INTERVENTION DAY (IE, THE DAY ON WHICH THEY BEGAN TO REDUCE OR QUIT SMOKING). PARTICIPANTS RATED, "I HAVE A DESIRE FOR A CIGARETTE RIGHT NOW," ON A 7-POINT LIKERT SCALE IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION. RESULTS: AFTER STATISTICALLY CONTROLLING FOR CO IN BREATH, PARTICIPANT TYPE, AGE, GENDER, RACE, AND ETHNICITY, A SIGNIFICANT TIME X CONDITION INTERACTION WAS FOUND, F(1, 47) = 4.72, P = .035, ETAP2 = .09, SUGGESTING CRAVING DECREASED AT A GREATER RATE IN THE HATHA YOGA CONDITION RELATIVE TO THE WELLNESS CONDITION. CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS FROM THIS STUDY ADD TO A GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH DEMONSTRATING THE POTENTIAL CLINICAL UTILITY OF HATHA YOGA AS AN ADJUNCTIVE INTERVENTION TOOL FOR SMOKING CESSATION. IMPLICATIONS: THIS IS THE FIRST KNOWN STUDY TO TEST THE IMPACT OF A SINGLE-SESSION HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION ON CRAVING AMONG ADULT SMOKERS ATTEMPTING TO REDUCE OR QUIT SMOKING. WE FOUND THAT 30 MINUTES OF HATHA YOGA PRODUCED A GREATER REDUCTION IN CRAVING COMPARED TO A 30-MINUTE WELLNESS CONTROL CONDITION. THIS RELATIONSHIP WAS EVIDENT EVEN AFTER STATISTICALLY ACCOUNTING FOR OTHER IMPORTANT VARIABLES (EG, GENDER). RESULTS OF THIS STUDY ADD TO A GROWING BODY OF LITERATURE DEMONSTRATING THE POTENTIAL CLINICAL UTILITY OF HATHA YOGA AS AN ADJUNCTIVE INTERVENTION STRATEGY FOR SMOKING CESSATION.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                 
15 1563  28 LONGITUDINAL EFFECTS OF A COMBINED PROGRAM OF PELVIC FLOOR MUSCLE TRAINING AND YOGA ON GENITOURINARY SYMPTOMS IN ASIAN WOMEN OF OLDER AGE: A RANDOMIZED EXPERIMENTAL STUDY. THIS PARALLEL-TWO-GROUP RANDOMIZED EXPERIMENTAL STUDY INCLUDING A SUPERVISED GROUP AND AN UNSUPERVISED GROUP EXAMINED THE LONGITUDINAL EFFECTS OF PELVIC FLOOR MUSCLE TRAINING (PFMT) COMBINED WITH YOGA ON GENITOURINARY SYMPTOMS AND THE HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL), AND COMPARED PRACTICE ADHERENCE RATES OF THE TWO GROUPS. A SAMPLE OF WOMEN EXPERIENCING >/=1 GENITOURINARY SYMPTOM(S) WERE RECRUITED AND ASSIGNED TO A SUPERVISED GROUP OR AN UNSUPERVISED GROUP. THE SUPERVISED GROUP ATTENDED SUPERVISED GROUP PRACTICE SESSIONS AND PERFORMED AT-HOME PRACTICE OF PFMT AND YOGA. THE UNSUPERVISED GROUP PERFORMED AT-HOME PRACTICE OF PFMT AND YOGA. INFORMATION WAS COLLECTED AT FIVE TIME POINTS (N = 91). GENERALIZED ESTIMATING EQUATION PROCEDURES WERE USED TO EXAMINE THE INTERVENTION EFFECTS. AN INDEPENDENT T-TEST WAS CONDUCTED TO COMPARE THE PRACTICE ADHERENCE RATES. BOTH GROUPS' GENITOURINARY SYMPTOMS AND HRQOL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED OVER TIME. THE SUPERVISED GROUP DISPLAYED GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN GENITOURINARY SYMPTOMS AND HRQOL AND BETTER ADHERENCE THAN DID THE UNSUPERVISED GROUP.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
16 2577  34 YOGA FOR GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER: DESIGN OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL. GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER (GAD) IS A COMMON DISORDER ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT DISTRESS AND INTERFERENCE. ALTHOUGH COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT) HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE FORM OF PSYCHOTHERAPY, FEW PATIENTS RECEIVE OR HAVE ACCESS TO THIS INTERVENTION. YOGA THERAPY OFFERS ANOTHER PROMISING, YET UNDER-RESEARCHED, INTERVENTION THAT IS GAINING INCREASING POPULARITY IN THE GENERAL PUBLIC, AS AN ANXIETY REDUCTION INTERVENTION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS INNOVATIVE CLINICAL TRIAL PROTOCOL IS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFICACY OF A KUNDALINI YOGA INTERVENTION, RELATIVE TO CBT AND A CONTROL CONDITION. KUNDALINI YOGA AND CBT ARE COMPARED WITH EACH OTHER IN A NONINFERIORITY TEST AND BOTH TREATMENTS ARE COMPARED TO STRESS EDUCATION TRAINING, AN ATTENTION CONTROL INTERVENTION, IN SUPERIORITY TESTS. THE SAMPLE WILL CONSIST OF 230 INDIVIDUALS WITH A PRIMARY DSM-5 DIAGNOSIS OF GAD. THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WILL COMPARE YOGA (N=95) TO BOTH CBT FOR GAD (N=95) AND STRESS EDUCATION (N=40), A COMMONLY USED CONTROL CONDITION. ALL THREE TREATMENTS WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY TWO INSTRUCTORS IN A GROUP FORMAT OVER 12 WEEKLY SESSIONS WITH FOUR TO SIX PATIENTS PER GROUP. GROUPS WILL BE RANDOMIZED USING PERMUTED BLOCK RANDOMIZATION, WHICH WILL BE STRATIFIED BY SITE. TREATMENT OUTCOME WILL BE EVALUATED BI-WEEKLY AND AT 6MONTH FOLLOW-UP. FURTHERMORE, POTENTIAL MEDIATORS OF TREATMENT OUTCOME WILL BE INVESTIGATED. GIVEN THE INDIVIDUAL AND ECONOMIC BURDEN ASSOCIATED WITH GAD, IDENTIFYING ACCESSIBLE ALTERNATIVE BEHAVIORAL TREATMENTS WILL HAVE SUBSTANTIVE PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLICATIONS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
17   16  34 "SMOKING DOES NOT GO WITH YOGA:" A QUALITATIVE STUDY OF WOMEN'S PHENOMENOLOGICAL PERCEPTIONS DURING YOGA AND SMOKING CESSATION. INTRODUCTION: SMOKING CESSATION IS OFTEN ACCOMPANIED BY WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS, CIGARETTE CRAVING, INCREASED NEGATIVE AFFECT, AND INCREASED EXPERIENCE OF STRESS. BECAUSE YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE STRESS AND NEGATIVE AFFECT, IT MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE AID TO SMOKING CESSATION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE WOMEN'S PHENOMENOLOGICAL EXPERIENCES OF VINYASA YOGA AS PART OF A SMOKING CESSATION PROGRAM. METHODS: FOCUS GROUPS WERE CONDUCTED POST-INTERVENTION WITH WOMEN (N = 20) WHO PARTICIPATED IN A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR SMOKING CESSATION. THE 8-WEEK VINYASA YOGA INTERVENTION INCLUDED TWICE WEEKLY 60-MINUTE CLASSES THAT INVOLVED BREATHING EXERCISES, POSTURES (ASANAS), AND RELAXATION TECHNIQUES. FOCUS GROUPS WERE AUDIO RECORDED AND TRANSCRIBED. THEMATIC ANALYSIS FOCUSED ON DESCRIPTIONS OF YOGA, BREATHING, AND BODILY SENSATIONS INCLUDING CIGARETTE CRAVING. RESULTS: FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANTS DESCRIBED VINYASA YOGA AS PHYSICALLY CHALLENGING. MOST REPORTED DELIBERATE USE OF YOGIC BREATHING TO COPE WITH CIGARETTE CRAVING AND STRESS. OTHER PERCEIVED EFFECTS INCLUDED RELAXATION AND AN INCREASED SENSE OF BODY AWARENESS AND WELLBEING. CONCLUSIONS: PARTICIPANTS VIEWED YOGA AS POSITIVE AND POTENTIALLY HELPFUL FOR QUITTING SMOKING. YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE ADJUNCT FOR SMOKING CESSATION.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
18 2456  40 YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR SMOKING CESSATION IN WOMEN. BACKGROUND: TOBACCO SMOKING REMAINS THE LEADING PREVENTABLE CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG AMERICAN WOMEN. AEROBIC EXERCISE HAS SHOWN PROMISE AS AN AID TO SMOKING CESSATION BECAUSE IT IMPROVES AFFECT AND REDUCES NICOTINE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS. STUDIES OUTSIDE THE REALM OF SMOKING CESSATION HAVE SHOWN THAT YOGA PRACTICE ALSO REDUCES PERCEIVED STRESS AND NEGATIVE AFFECT. METHODS: THIS PILOT STUDY EXAMINES THE FEASIBILITY AND INITIAL EFFICACY OF YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR SMOKING CESSATION. FIFTY-FIVE WOMEN WERE GIVEN 8-WEEK GROUP-BASED COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR SMOKING CESSATION AND WERE RANDOMIZED TO A TWICE-WEEKLY PROGRAM OF VINYASA YOGA OR A GENERAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS PROGRAM (CONTACT CONTROL). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS 7-DAY POINT PREVALENCE ABSTINENCE AT THE END OF TREATMENT VALIDATED BY SALIVA COTININE TESTING. LONGITUDINAL ANALYSES WERE ALSO CONDUCTED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF INTERVENTION ON SMOKING CESSATION AT 3- AND 6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF THE INTERVENTION ON POTENTIAL MEDIATING VARIABLES (E.G., CONFIDENCE IN QUITTING SMOKING, SELF-EFFICACY), AS WELL AS MEASURES OF DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, ANXIETY, AND PERCEIVED HEALTH (SF-36). RESULTS: AT END OF TREATMENT, WOMEN IN THE YOGA GROUP HAD A GREATER 7-DAY POINT-PREVALENCE ABSTINENCE RATE THAN CONTROLS (ODDS RATIO [OR], 4.56; 95% CI, 1.1-18.6). ABSTINENCE REMAINED HIGHER AMONG YOGA PARTICIPANTS THROUGH THE SIX MONTH ASSESSMENT (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 0.34-6.92), ALTHOUGH DIFFERENCES WERE NO LONGER STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. WOMEN PARTICIPATING IN THE YOGA PROGRAM ALSO SHOWED REDUCED ANXIETY AND IMPROVEMENTS IN PERCEIVED HEALTH AND WELL-BEING WHEN COMPARED WITH CONTROLS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA MAY BE AN EFFICACIOUS COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR SMOKING CESSATION AMONG WOMEN.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
19 2788  26 YOGA THERAPY DYADS: A NOVEL APPROACH TO CHRONIC PAIN MANAGEMENT IN UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS. YOGA THERAPY IS AN EMERGING INTEGRATIVE HEALTH APPROACH THAT APPLIES THE PRACTICES AND TEACHINGS OF YOGA FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH CLINICAL CONCERNS. IT IS GENERALLY OFFERED AS INDIVIDUAL SESSIONS BETWEEN A YOGA THERAPIST AND CLIENT OR IN A SMALL GROUP SETTING WITH SEVERAL CLIENTS WHO SHARE A CLINICAL CONCERN. HERE WE DESCRIBE A THIRD MODEL FOR CONSIDERATION- THE YOGA THERAPY DYAD. A DYAD INCLUDES TWO CLIENTS WORKING SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH A SINGLE YOGA THERAPIST AND DIFFERS FROM BOTH INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP SESSIONS IN THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES. THE YOGA THERAPY DYAD MODEL THAT IS DETAILED HERE WAS IMPLEMENTED AS PART OF A FEASIBILITY TRIAL ALONG WITH GROUP ACUPUNCTURE THERAPY FOR CHRONIC PAIN IN AN UNDERSERVED POPULATION. UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS ARE AT RISK FOR PAIN AND REDUCED ACCESS TO CARE. THIS PILOT MAY INFORM FUTURE RESEARCH, POLICY, EDUCATION, AND CLINICAL PRACTICE.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
20 2880  19 YOGA: A BIOBEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO REDUCE SYMPTOM DISTRESS IN WOMEN WITH URGE URINARY INCONTINENCE. URGE URINARY INCONTINENCE IS A DEBILITATING CHRONIC CONDITION THAT POSES CHALLENGES FOR AFFECTED WOMEN AND THE CLINICIANS WHO CARE FOR THEM. MULTICOMPONENT BEHAVIORAL THERAPIES HAVE SHOWN PROMISE IN ALLOWING WOMEN TO MANAGE THEIR SYMPTOMS.

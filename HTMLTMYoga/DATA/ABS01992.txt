1 1992 98 STAFF PERSPECTIVES REGARDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A YOGA INTERVENTION WITH CHRONIC PAIN SELF-MANAGEMENT IN A CLINICAL SETTING. CHRONIC PAIN AFFECTS MILLIONS OF AMERICANS AND CAN BE ADDRESSED THROUGH MULTIPLE MODALITIES, INTERVENTIONS, AND STRATEGIES. YOGA AND SELF-MANAGEMENT HAVE BEEN PROVEN EFFECTIVE IN TREATING CHRONIC PAIN, BUT LITTLE RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONDUCTED ON THE FEASIBILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS RELATED TO THESE ALTERNATIVE INTERVENTION FORMS. IN OUR QUALITATIVE STUDY, WE EXAMINED STAFF PERCEPTIONS REGARDING THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING YOGA ALONG WITH ESTABLISHED SELF-MANAGEMENT AT A PAIN MANAGEMENT CLINIC IN COLORADO. WE UTILIZED THE IMPLEMENTATION DRIVERS OF COMPETENCY, ORGANIZATIONAL, AND LEADERSHIP, AND OUR ADDED HYPOTHETICAL DRIVER TO EXPLORE BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS RELATED TO PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT POSITIVE STAFF AND PATIENT ATTITUDES WERE CRUCIAL FOR SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION. WE ALSO IDENTIFIED PHYSICAL SPACE, TRANSPORTATION, AND SUPPORTIVE LEADERSHIP AS NECESSARY COMPONENTS OF PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION. FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO EXAMINE BARRIERS SUCH AS FUNDING TO ENSURE INTERVENTION SUSTAINABILITY AND THE NEED FOR ADEQUATE STAFFING.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
2 1712 25 PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF YOGA AMONG URBAN SCHOOL STUDENTS: A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS. THIS STUDY REPORTS ON THE FINDINGS OF A QUALITATIVE EVALUATION OF A YOGA INTERVENTION PROGRAM FOR URBAN MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL YOUTH IN NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC AND CHARTER SCHOOLS. SIX FOCUS GROUPS WERE CONDUCTED WITH STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN A YEAR-LONG YOGA PROGRAM TO DETERMINE THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL BENEFITS AS WELL AS BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES. RESULTS SHOW THAT STUDENTS PERCEIVED THE BENEFITS OF YOGA AS INCREASED SELF-REGULATION, MINDFULNESS, SELF-ESTEEM, PHYSICAL CONDITIONING, ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE, AND STRESS REDUCTION. BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES FOR A YOGA PRACTICE INCLUDE LACK OF TIME AND SPACE. THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE BENEFITS EXPERIENCED ARE INTERRELATED TO ONE ANOTHER IS DISCUSSED. SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH AND SCHOOL-BASED PROGRAMMING ARE ALSO OFFERED.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
3 2600 17 YOGA FOR OSTEOARTHRITIS: NURSING AND RESEARCH CONSIDERATIONS. OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) IS A LEADING CAUSE OF PAIN AND DISABILITY WORLDWIDE. CURRENT TREATMENT GUIDELINES RECOMMEND NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES SUCH AS YOGA FOR FIRSTLINE TREATMENT OF OA. YOGA IS A PROMISING MIND-BODY PRACTICE THAT INCLUDES PHYSICAL POSTURES, BREATHING PRACTICES, AND MEDITATIVE MENTAL FOCUS. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS THE CURRENT EVIDENCE, AS WELL AS A PROPOSED CONCEPTUAL MODEL FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. CURRENT RESEARCH ON YOGA FOR OA IS SCANT BUT PROMISING, SHOWING SOME EVIDENCE OF REDUCED PAIN, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, AND DISABILITY. THE CONCEPTUAL MODEL DESCRIBED HERE PROPOSES MUSCULOSKELETAL EFFECTS (STRENGTHENING, FLEXIBILITY, RELAXATION), REDUCTION OF AUTONOMIC AROUSAL, AND THERAPEUTIC COGNITIVE PATTERNS (DISTRACTION, MINDFULNESS) AS POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT MECHANISMS OF YOGA. THIS ARTICLE ALSO DESCRIBES CONSIDERATIONS FOR PATIENTS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WHEN EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL USEFULNESS AND SAFETY OF YOGA PROGRAMS: YOGA STYLE, INSTRUCTOR QUALIFICATIONS, AND AMOUNT OF TIME SPENT IN YOGA PRACTICE.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
4 1956 14 SELF-CARE AND YOGA-ACADEMIC-PRACTICE COLLABORATION FOR OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH.

5 2711 27 YOGA KERNELS: A PUBLIC HEALTH MODEL FOR DEVELOPING AND DISSEMINATING EVIDENCE-BASED YOGA PRACTICES. MANY PEOPLE ARE DRAWN TO YOGA FOR ITS POTENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS. WITH ITS RISING POPULARITY, YOGA COULD BECOME A WIDELY USED PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION, BUT ITS SUCCESS DEPENDS ON FINDING EVIDENCE-BASED YOGA PRACTICES THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE AND FEASIBLE FOR A LARGE SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION. COMPLEXITY AND VARIABILITY CREATE BARRIERS TO THE ADOPTION AND MAINTENANCE OF YOGA PRACTICES. IN AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE THE STUDY, ADOPTION, AND MAINTENANCE OF THERAPEUTIC PRACTICES USED IN THE CONTEXT OF PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS, WE INTRODUCE THE CONCEPT OF "YOGA KERNELS," DEFINED AS DISCRETE, EVIDENCE-BASED YOGA PRACTICES THAT ARE AMENABLE TO SCIENTIFIC STUDY AND CAN BE EFFECTIVELY DISSEMINATED AS A PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION. YOGA IS REVIEWED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF A PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION USING THE REACH EFFECTIVENESS ADOPTION IMPLEMENTATION AND MAINTENANCE (RE-AIM) MODEL. THIS MODEL IS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE SUCCESSFUL ADOPTION AND MAINTENANCE OF GENERALIZABLE, EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS. IN RESPONSE TO THE CHALLENGES TO THE ADOPTION AND MAINTENANCE OF YOGA PRACTICES, WE PROPOSE THAT A POTENTIALLY FRUITFUL DIRECTION FOR YOGA RESEARCH IS MOVING AWAY FROM STUDYING YOGA CLASSES TO STUDYING SPECIFIC YOGA PRACTICES THAT ARE SIMPLER AND EASIER FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO USE. YOGA KERNELS COULD BE A UNIFYING CONCEPT TO IDENTIFY THERAPEUTIC USES OF YOGA AND HELP PEOPLE ADOPT AND MAINTAIN THESE PRACTICES AS PART OF A SYSTEMATIC PUBLIC HEALTH STRATEGY.	2019

SUPPORTED BY OTHER TREATMENT MODALITIES, YOGA CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR INCREASING SELF-AWARENESS, REFLECTION AND THE ABILITY TO SELF-SOOTHE. LIKE OTHER INTERVENTIONS, YOGA HAS POTENTIAL MISUSES. THESE MISUSES ARE UNCOVERED WITH SUGGESTIONS MADE AS TO HOW THERAPISTS CAN SUPPORT THE PRACTICE OF YOGA IN RESIDENTIAL AND OUTPATIENT SETTINGS.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
7  376 30 BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO YOGA USE IN A POPULATION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH SELF-REPORTED CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: A QUALITATIVE APPROACH. YOGA HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE EFFICACIOUS IN TREATING CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN, YET BIOMEDICAL TREATMENTS ARE MOST COMMONLY USED FOR PAIN. PROMOTING YOGA AS PART OF INTEGRATIVE CARE WOULD REDUCE EXCLUSIVE RELIANCE ON HIGH-COST, HIGHER-RISK BIOMEDICAL TREATMENTS. ATTITUDES TOWARD YOGA PLAY A ROLE IN CONSIDERATION OF IT AS A TREATMENT. THE CURRENT STUDY EXAMINED ATTITUDES TOWARD YOGA IN ADULTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN AND COMPARED THESE RESULTS TO THOSE FOUND IN A 2009 GENERAL POPULATION STUDY. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED A SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW WHERE THEY RESPONDED TO ITEMS ABOUT PERCEPTIONS OF POTENTIAL BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO TRYING YOGA. PARTICIPANT RESPONSES WERE ANALYZED QUALITATIVELY AND SEVERAL COMMON THEMES EMERGED. THEMES IDENTIFIED BY PARTICIPANTS INDICATED THERE IS MIXED INFORMATION ABOUT YOGA IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN AND THAT CLARIFICATION OF WHAT YOGA IS, HOW IT CAN BE BENEFICIAL, AND WHAT IT REQUIRES ONE TO DO PHYSICALLY MAY HELP PROMOTE ITS USE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
8 2586 25 YOGA FOR HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS: A STUDY ON BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS OF ITS IMPLEMENTATION IN PRIMARY CARE. BACKGROUND: INTERNATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR HYPERTENSION TREATMENT RECOMMEND THE USE OF YOGA, PARTICULARLY AMONG LOW-RISK PATIENTS. HOWEVER, EVIDENCE IS LACKING ON THE IMPLEMENTATION POTENTIAL OF HEALTH-WORKER-LED YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN LOW-RESOURCE, PRIMARY CARE SETTINGS. OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS BARRIERS TO AND FACILITATORS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS IN PRIMARY CARE IN NEPAL. METHODS: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED USING FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS, IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS, KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS, AND TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS. DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM THE 'YOGA AND HYPERTENSION' (YOH) TRIAL PARTICIPANTS, YOH INTERVENTION IMPLEMENTERS, AND OFFICIALS FROM THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND POPULATION IN NEPAL. RESULTS: MOST YOH TRIAL PARTICIPANTS STATED THAT: (1) IT WAS EASY TO LEARN YOGA DURING A FIVE-DAY TRAINING PERIOD AND PRACTISE IT FOR THREE MONTHS AT HOME; (2) PRACTISING YOGA IMPROVED THEIR HEALTH; AND (3) GROUP YOGA SESSIONS IN A COMMUNITY CENTRE WOULD HELP THEM PRACTISE YOGA MORE REGULARLY. MOST YOH INTERVENTION IMPLEMENTERS STATED THAT: (1) THEY WERE HIGHLY MOTIVATED TO IMPLEMENT THE INTERVENTION; (2) THE COST OF IMPLEMENTATION WAS ACCEPTABLE; (3) THEY DID NOT NEED ADDITIONAL STAFF TO EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT THE INTERVENTION; (4) PROVIDING REMUNERATION TO THE STAFF INVOLVED IN THE INTERVENTION WOULD INCREASE THEIR MOTIVATION; AND (5) THE YOGA PROGRAMME WAS 'SIMPLE AND EASY TO FOLLOW' AND 'EASILY PERFORMED BY PARTICIPANTS OF ANY AGE'. THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS STATED THAT: (1) YOGA IS CONSIDERED AS A KEY HEALTH PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY IN NEPAL; AND (2) THE INTEGRATION OF THE YOGA INTERVENTION INTO THE EXISTING HEALTH CARE PROGRAMME WOULD NOT BE TOO CHALLENGING, BECAUSE THE EXISTING PERSONNEL AND OTHER RESOURCES CAN BE UTILISED. CONCLUSION: WHILE THERE IS A GOOD POTENTIAL THAT A YOGA INTERVENTION CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN PRIMARY CARE, CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT FOR HEALTH WORKERS AND THE INVOLVEMENT OF COMMUNITY YOGA CENTRES IN THE DELIVERY OF THE INTERVENTIONS MAY BE REQUIRED TO FACILITATE THIS IMPLEMENTATION.	2021	
                                          
9 1937 24 ROLE OF YOGA IN THE TREATMENT OF NEUROTIC DISORDERS: CURRENT STATUS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS. A LARGE NUMBER OF STUDIES HAVE CONSISTENTLY DEMONSTRATED THE POTENTIAL OF YOGA, NOT ONLY IN THE TREATMENT OF PSYCHIATRIC AND PSYCHOSOMATIC DISORDER BUT ALSO IN PROMOTING POSITIVE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. THIS PAPER REVIEWS VARIOUS STUDIES ON THE TREATMENT OF NEUROSIS WITH TECHNIQUES DERIVED FROM YOGA. A FEW LACUNAE HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND POSSIBLE DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH ARE OUTLINED. IT IS HOPED THAT RESEARCH ALONG THESE LINES WILL DEVELOP A STANDARDIZED METHOD OF YOGA THERAPY WHICH CAN BE UTILIZED AND INTEGRATED WITHIN THE EXISTING METHODS OF TREATMENT OF NEUROTIC DISORDERS.	1994

THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE ROLE OF YOGA THERAPY IN COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT (CIPM). THE PAIN CRISIS IS DESCRIBED, AND HOW YOGA THERAPISTS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO ITS SOLUTION IS EXPLAINED. YOGA THERAPY CAN BE AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF THE MULTIDISCIPLINARY UNDERTAKING THAT WILL BE REQUIRED TO IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES AND ALTER THE TRAJECTORY OF THE GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS CONSTITUTED BY AN EPIDEMIC OF POORLY UNDERSTOOD AND INADEQUATELY ADDRESSED PAIN. ADDITIONAL CONTEXT AND EVIDENCE ARE PRESENTED TO DOCUMENT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTIONS TO SUPPORT PEOPLE LIVING WITH PAIN. THE WHITE PAPER CONCLUDES BY LISTING RECOMMENDATIONS TO PROVIDERS, CONSUMERS, PAYERS, AND LEGISLATORS, WHO TOGETHER CAN ADDRESS SYSTEMIC AND STRUCTURAL BARRIERS TO CIPM, AS WELL AS SUGGESTIONS FOR ENABLING THE YOGA THERAPY PROFESSION TO MORE FULLY PARTICIPATE IN THESE SOLUTIONS.	2020

HOWEVER, DESPITE YOGA'S PROMISE AS A POTENTIAL TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION, THE LITERATURE TO DATE IS MARKED BY SUBSTANTIAL METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS, WHICH REMAIN A BARRIER TO THE INTEGRATION OF YBIS INTO CONVENTIONAL CLINICAL CARE. WE HIGHLIGHT FIVE KEY AREAS OF STUDY THAT NEED FURTHER INVESTIGATION TO FILL CRUCIAL GAPS IN THE LITERATURE-BASE TO ADVANCE YOGA RESEARCH AND YOGA'S POTENTIAL AS AN EFFECTIVE EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
13 1213 24 EXPLORING PERCEIVED BENEFITS, MOTIVES, BARRIERS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRESCRIBING YOGA EXERCISES AS A NONPHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION FOR PATIENTS WITH EPILEPSY: A QUALITATIVE STUDY FROM PALESTINE. OBJECTIVES: YOGA IS BELIEVED TO PLAY A ROLE IN STABILIZING THE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM AND THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM, THUS MIGHT HELP CONTROL SEIZURES IN PEOPLE WITH EPILEPSY (PWE). THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO EXPLORE EXPERIENCES OF PALESTINIAN PWE WITH REGARD TO BENEFITS, MOTIVES, BARRIERS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF PRESCRIBING YOGA EXERCISES AS A NONPHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION. METHODS: PURPOSIVE AND SNOWBALL SAMPLING TECHNIQUES WERE USED TO RECRUIT PWE WHO PRACTICED YOGA. SEMI-STRUCTURED IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS (N=18) WERE CONDUCTED WITH THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS. THE INTERPRETIVE DESCRIPTION METHOD WAS USED TO QUALITATIVELY ANALYZE THE DATA COLLECTED DURING THE INTERVIEWS. RESULTS: FOLLOWING THE THEMATIC ANALYSIS ADOPTED FOR THIS STUDY, FOUR MAJOR THEMES EMERGED. THESE THEMES WERE AS FOLLOWS: PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF YOGA, MOTIVES TO PRACTICE YOGA, BARRIERS TO PRACTICE YOGA, AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON EFFECTIVE YOGA PRACTICE FOR PWE. THE PERCEIVED BENEFITS INCLUDED IMPROVEMENTS IN MANAGEMENT OF SEIZURES, PSYCHOLOGICAL, PHYSICAL, AND SOCIAL WELL-BEING. PEOPLE WITH EPILEPSY WERE MOTIVATED BY THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF YOGA. BARRIERS OF ADHERENCE TO PRACTICE INCLUDED PERSONAL AND LOGISTIC FACTORS. THE INTERVIEWEES RECOMMENDED TAILORING YOGA SESSIONS TO THE NEEDS OF PWE. CONCLUSION: THIS EXPLORATIVE QUALITATIVE STUDY REPORTED PERCEIVED BENEFITS, MOTIVES, BARRIERS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF YOGA AS A NONPHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION FOR PWE. PEOPLE WITH EPILEPSY USED YOGA AS A BENEFICIAL NONPHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH AND REDUCE THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF EPILEPSY ON THEIR PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL-BEING. FUTURE STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO INVESTIGATE THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF YOGA WHEN SESSIONS ARE TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF PWE.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
14   25 23 'A SOFTENING OF EDGES': A COMPARISON OF YOGA CLASSES AT PALLIATIVE CARE SERVICES IN NEW DELHI AND LONDON. ALTHOUGH THE USE OF YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY IS COMMON IN PALLIATIVE CARE, THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE REGARDING CURRENT PRACTICE TO INFORM SERVICE PROVISION AND RESEARCH. THE AIM WAS TO EXPLORE AND COMPARE YOGA CLASSES OFFERED BY PALLIATIVE CARE SERVICES IN NEW DELHI AND LONDON. SEMI-STRUCTURED QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH YOGA TEACHERS AND PARTICIPANTS AT TWO SERVICES AND ANALYSED THEMATICALLY. PARTICIPANTS WERE: IN DELHI EIGHT FAMILY CARERS, THREE PATIENTS, AND TWO TEACHERS; IN LONDON SIX PATIENTS, ONE TEACHER, AND ONE ASSISTANT. SIX KEY THEMES ARE DESCRIBED: CONTENT OF CLASSES, SYMPTOMS AND PROBLEMS, PRECONCEPTIONS AND THE MEANING OF YOGA, EFFECTS OF YOGA, CHALLENGES, AND RECOMMENDATIONS. THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY TO EXAMINE THE EXPERIENCES OF PATIENTS AND CARERS PRACTISING YOGA IN PALLIATIVE CARE SETTINGS. RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE SUPPORTING AND EDUCATING YOGA TEACHERS WORKING WITH THIS POPULATION, AND THE NEED FOR ROBUST TRIALS.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
15  333 17 APPLICATION OF YOGA IN RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT OF TRAUMATIZED YOUTH. BACKGROUND: THE TRAUMA CENTER AT JUSTICE RESOURCE INSTITUTE HAS ADAPTED A FORM OF HATHA YOGA INTO A TRAUMA-SENSITIVE ADJUNCTIVE COMPONENT OF INTERVENTION FOR USE WITH COMPLEXLY TRAUMATIZED INDIVIDUALS EXHIBITING CHRONIC AFFECTIVE AND SOMATIC DYSREGULATION AND ASSOCIATED BEHAVIORAL, FUNCTIONING, AND HEALTH COMPLAINTS. OBJECTIVES: THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE USE OF YOGA WITH TRAUMATIZED YOUTH (AGED 12-21 YEARS) IN RESIDENTIAL TREATMENT. DESIGN: A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE ON THE SOMATIC IMPACT OF TRAUMA EXPOSURE PROVIDES A RATIONALE FOR THE USE OF YOGA WITH THIS POPULATION AND HIGHLIGHTS AN EMERGING EVIDENCE BASE IN SUPPORT OF THIS PRACTICE. CASE VIGNETTES ILLUSTRATE THE INTEGRATION OF STRUCTURED, GENTLE YOGA PRACTICES INTO RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMMING FOR YOUTH WITH SEVERE EMOTIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS. RESULTS: ANECDOTAL DATA AND CLINICAL OBSERVATION UNDERSCORE THE PROMISE OF YOGA AS A VIABLE APPROACH TO BUILD SELF-REGULATORY CAPACITY OF TRAUMATIZED YOUTH. CONCLUSIONS: FUTURE DIRECTIONS IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA PRACTICES FOR YOUTH ARE DISCUSSED.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
16 1950 27 SCHOOL-BASED YOGA PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES: A SURVEY. CONTEXT: SUBSTANTIAL INTEREST HAS BEGUN TO EMERGE AROUND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN SCHOOLS. RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT YOGA PRACTICES MAY ENHANCE SKILLS SUCH AS SELF-REGULATION AND PROSOCIAL BEHAVIOR, AND LEAD TO IMPROVEMENTS IN STUDENTS' PERFORMANCE. THESE RESEARCHERS, THEREFORE, HAVE PROPOSED THAT CONTEMPLATIVE PRACTICES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN ENHANCING THE QUALITY OF US PUBLIC EDUCATION. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO PROVIDE A SUMMARY AND COMPARISON OF SCHOOL-BASED YOGA PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES. DESIGN: ONLINE, LISTSERV, AND DATABASE SEARCHES WERE CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY PROGRAMS, AND INFORMATION WAS COLLECTED REGARDING EACH PROGRAM'S SCOPE OF WORK, CURRICULUM CHARACTERISTICS, TEACHER-CERTIFICATION AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS, IMPLEMENTATION MODELS, MODES OF OPERATION, AND GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS. SETTING: THE ONLINE, LISTSERV, AND DATABASE SEARCHES TOOK PLACE IN BOSTON, MA, USA, AND NEW HAVEN, CT, USA. RESULTS: THIRTY-SIX PROGRAMS WERE IDENTIFIED THAT OFFER YOGA IN MORE THAN 940 SCHOOLS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES, AND MORE THAN 5400 INSTRUCTORS HAVE BEEN TRAINED BY THESE PROGRAMS TO OFFER YOGA IN EDUCATIONAL SETTINGS. DESPITE SOME VARIABILITY IN THE EXACT MODE OF IMPLEMENTATION, TRAINING REQUIREMENTS, LOCATIONS SERVED, AND GRADES COVERED, THE MAJORITY OF THE PROGRAMS SHARE A COMMON GOAL OF TEACHING 4 BASIC ELEMENTS OF YOGA: (1) PHYSICAL POSTURES, (2) BREATHING EXERCISES, (3) RELAXATION TECHNIQUES, AND (4) MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION PRACTICES. THE PROGRAMS ALSO TEACH A VARIETY OF ADDITIONAL EDUCATIONAL, SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL, AND DIDACTIC TECHNIQUES TO ENHANCE STUDENTS' MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH AND BEHAVIOR. CONCLUSIONS: THE FACT THAT THE PRESENT STUDY WAS ABLE TO FIND A RELATIVELY LARGE NUMBER OF FORMAL, SCHOOL-BASED YOGA PROGRAMS CURRENTLY BEING IMPLEMENTED IN THE UNITED STATES SUGGESTS THAT THE PROGRAMS MAY BE ACCEPTABLE AND FEASIBLE TO IMPLEMENT. THE RESULTS ALSO SUGGEST THAT THE POPULARITY OF SCHOOL-BASED YOGA PROGRAMS MAY CONTINUE TO GROW.	2015	
                                                                                                       
17  380 23 BECOMING CONNECTED: THE LIVED EXPERIENCE OF YOGA PARTICIPATION AFTER STROKE. PURPOSE: TO INVESTIGATE THE PERSONAL EXPERIENCES AND PERCEIVED OUTCOMES OF A YOGA PROGRAMME FOR STROKE SURVIVORS. METHOD: THIS ARTICLE REPORTS ON A PRELIMINARY STUDY USING QUALITATIVE METHODS TO INVESTIGATE THE PERSONAL EXPERIENCES AND PERCEIVED OUTCOMES OF A YOGA PROGRAMME. NINE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD EXPERIENCED STROKE WERE INTERVIEWED FOLLOWING A 10-WEEK YOGA PROGRAMME INVOLVING MOVEMENT, BREATHING AND MEDITATION PRACTICES. AN INTERPRETATIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL APPROACH WAS USED TO DETERMINE MEANINGS ATTACHED TO YOGA PARTICIPATION AS WELL AS PERCEPTIONS OF OUTCOMES. RESULTS: INTERPRETATIVE THEMES EVOLVING FROM THE DATA WERE ORGANISED AROUND A BIO-PSYCHOSOCIAL MODEL OF HEALTH BENEFITS FROM YOGA. EMERGENT THEMES FROM THE ANALYSIS INCLUDED: GREATER SENSATION; FEELING CALMER AND BECOMING CONNECTED. THESE THEMES RESPECTIVELY REVEALED PERCEIVED PHYSICAL IMPROVEMENTS IN TERMS OF STRENGTH, RANGE OF MOVEMENT OR WALKING ABILITY, AN IMPROVED SENSE OF CALMNESS AND THE POSSIBILITY FOR RECONNECTING AND ACCEPTING A DIFFERENT BODY. CONCLUSION: THE STUDY HAS GENERATED ORIGINAL FINDINGS THAT SUGGEST THAT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD A STROKE YOGA PARTICIPATION CAN PROVIDE A NUMBER OF MEANINGFUL PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL BENEFITS AND SUPPORT THE RATIONALE FOR INCORPORATING YOGA AND MEDITATION-BASED PRACTICES INTO REHABILITATION PROGRAMMES.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
18  375 38 BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO IMPLEMENTING BUNDLED ACUPUNCTURE AND YOGA THERAPY TO TREAT CHRONIC PAIN IN COMMUNITY HEALTHCARE SETTINGS: A FEASIBILITY PILOT. OBJECTIVE: TO IDENTIFY FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTING BUNDLED GROUP ACUPUNCTURE AND YOGA THERAPY (YT) TO TREAT UNDERSERVED PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC PAIN IN COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER (CHC) SETTINGS. THIS IS NOT AN IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE STUDY, BUT RATHER AN ORGANIZED APPROACH FOR IDENTIFICATION OF BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO IMPLEMENTING THESE THERAPIES AS A PRECURSOR TO A FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE STUDY. DESIGN: THIS STUDY WAS PART OF A SINGLE-ARM FEASIBILITY TRIAL, WHICH AIMED TO TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF BUNDLING GA AND YT FOR CHRONIC PAIN IN CHCS. TREATMENT OUTCOMES WERE MEASURED BEFORE AND AFTER THE 10-WEEK INTERVENTION PERIOD. IMPLEMENTATION FEASIBILITY WAS ASSESSED THROUGH WEEKLY RESEARCH TEAM MEETINGS, WEEKLY YOGA PROVIDER MEETINGS, MONTHLY ACUPUNCTURE PROVIDER MEETINGS, AND WEEKLY PROVIDER SURVEYS. SETTINGS: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN NEW YORK CITY AT TWO MONTEFIORE MEDICAL GROUP (MMG) SITES IN THE BRONX, AND ONE INSTITUTE FOR FAMILY HEALTH (IFH) SITE IN HARLEM. SUBJECTS: PARTICIPANTS IN THE FEASIBILITY TRIAL WERE RECRUITED FROM IFH AND MMG SITES, AND NEEDED TO HAVE HAD LOWER BACK, NECK, OR OSTEOARTHRITIS PAIN FOR >3 MONTHS. IMPLEMENTATION STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDED THE RESEARCH TEAM, PROVIDERS OF ACUPUNCTURE AND YT, REFERRING PROVIDERS, AND CHC STAFF. RESULTS: IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE THERAPIES WAS ASSESSED USING THE CONSOLIDATED FRAMEWORK FOR IMPLEMENTATION RESEARCH. WE IDENTIFIED ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH SCHEDULING, TREATMENT FIDELITY, COMMUNICATION, THE THREE-WAY DISCIPLINARY INTERACTION OF ACUPUNCTURE, YOGA, AND BIOMEDICINE, SPACE ADAPTATION, SITE-SPECIFIC LOGISTICAL AND OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS, AND PATIENT-PROVIDER LANGUAGE BARRIERS. ISSUES VARIED AS TO THEIR FREQUENCY AND RESOLUTION DIFFICULTY. CONCLUSIONS: THIS FEASIBILITY TRIAL IDENTIFIED IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND RESOLUTION STRATEGIES THAT COULD BE FURTHER EXPLORED IN FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION STUDIES.

19 1588 29 MEDICAL YOGA: ANOTHER WAY OF BEING IN THE WORLD-A PHENOMENOLOGICAL STUDY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF PERSONS SUFFERING FROM STRESS-RELATED SYMPTOMS. THE PREVALENCE OF STRESS-RELATED ILLNESS HAS GROWN IN RECENT YEARS. MANY OF THESE PATIENTS SEEK HELP IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE. YOGA CAN REDUCE STRESS AND THUS COMPLEMENTS PHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPY IN MEDICAL PRACTICE. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, NO STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED PATIENTS' EXPERIENCES OF YOGA TREATMENT IN A PRIMARY HEALTH CARE SETTING OR, SPECIFICALLY, THE EXPERIENCES OF YOGA WHEN SUFFERING FROM STRESS-RELATED ILLNESS. THUS, THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE THE MEANING OF PARTICIPATING IN MEDICAL YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR STRESS-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSIS IN A PRIMARY HEALTH CARE SETTING. THIS STUDY HAS A DESCRIPTIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL DESIGN AND TOOK PLACE AT A PRIMARY HEALTH CARE CENTRE IN SWEDEN DURING 2011. FIVE WOMEN AND ONE MAN (43-51 YEARS) PARTICIPATED. THEY WERE RECRUITED FROM THE INTERVENTION GROUP (N=18) IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL, IN WHICH THEY HAD PARTICIPATED IN A MEDICAL YOGA GROUP IN ADDITION TO STANDARD CARE FOR 12 WEEKS. DATA WERE COLLECTED BY MEANS OF QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS, AND A PHENOMENOLOGICAL DATA ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED. THE ESSENTIAL MEANING OF THE MEDICAL YOGA EXPERIENCE WAS THAT THE MEDICAL YOGA WAS NOT AN ENDPOINT OF RECOVERY BUT THE START OF A PROCESS TOWARDS AN INCREASED SENSE OF WHOLENESS. IT WAS DESCRIBED AS A WAY OF ALLEVIATING SUFFERING, AND IT PROVIDED THE PARTICIPANTS WITH A TOOL FOR DEALING WITH THEIR STRESS AND CURRENT SITUATION ON A PRACTICAL LEVEL. IT LED TO GREATER SELF-AWARENESS AND SELF-ESTEEM, WHICH IN TURN HAD AN IMPLICIT IMPACT ON THEIR LIFEWORLD. IN PHENOMENOLOGICAL TERMS, THIS CAN BE SUMMARIZED AS ANOTHER WAY OF BEING IN THE WORLD, ENCOMPASSING A PERCEPTION OF DEEPENED IDENTITY. FROM A PHILOSOPHICAL PERSPECTIVE, DUE TO USING THE BODY IN A NEW WAY (YOGA), THE PARTICIPANTS HAD LEARNT TO SEE THINGS DIFFERENTLY, WHICH ENRICHED AND RECAST THEIR PERCEPTION OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR LIVES.	2014

OBJECTIVE: THIS PRELIMINARY, PILOT STUDY ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A GROUP-BASED, MINDFULNESS INTERVENTION IN A RESIDENTIAL, REHABILITATION SETTING WITH SPECIFIC FOCUS ON ASSESSING PARTICIPANTS' SELF-REPORT OF PERCEIVED BENEFIT OF THE INTERVENTION ON OVERALL HEALTH, PAIN, SLEEP, MOOD/ANXIETY, ATTENTION, AND SELF-AWARENESS, AS WELL AS IMPLEMENTING MODIFICATIONS NEEDED FOR SUCCESSFUL INTERVENTION APPLICATION AMONG A DIVERSE, CLINICAL MILITARY POPULATION. METHOD/DESIGN: PARTICIPANTS WERE 19 VETERANS AND ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBERS WITH A HISTORY OF TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI; 63% SEVERE) WHO COMPLETED A MINDFULNESS-BASED GROUP INTERVENTION DURING INPATIENT ADMISSION AT A VETERANS AFFAIRS POLYTRAUMA TRANSITIONAL REHABILITATION PROGRAM (PTRP). MINDFULNESS AND YOGA SKILLS WERE TAUGHT IN A REQUIRED, WEEKLY GROUP INCORPORATED INTO PARTICIPANTS' REHABILITATION SCHEDULE. OPINIONS AND ATTITUDES ABOUT MINDFULNESS, AS WELL AS PERTINENT SELF-REPORT OUTCOME MEASURES, WERE OBTAINED PRE- AND POSTGROUP PARTICIPATION. RESULTS: RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT PARTICIPATION IN THE GROUP WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH INDIVIDUALS' SELF-REPORTED BELIEF ABOUT THE BENEFIT OF MINDFULNESS IN THE AREAS OF OVERALL HEALTH, PHYSICAL HEALTH, MOOD, FOCUS, AND SELF-AWARENESS. THE MORE GROUPS ATTENDED, THE MORE POSITIVE THE PARTICIPANTS' BELIEFS ABOUT POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OVERALL HEALTH AND MOOD BECAME, EVEN WHILE CONTROLLING FOR LENGTH OF REHABILITATION STAY. ADDITIONALLY, SEVERAL SPECIFIC GROUP MODIFICATIONS RELEVANT TO THIS POPULATION (E.G., PHYSICAL/ENVIRONMENTAL MODIFICATIONS, REPETITION, IGNORING/REORIENTING) WERE IMPLEMENTED TO SUPPORT SUCCESSFUL PARTICIPATION. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: THESE PRELIMINARY AND EXPLORATORY FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT IT MAY BE WORTHWHILE FOR PSYCHOLOGISTS, CLINICIANS, AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WORKING WITH A MIXED TBI POPULATION, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY A MILITARY POPULATION WITH TBI, TO CONSIDER INTRODUCING MINDFULNESS SKILLS AS PART OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY REHABILITATION.

1   46 264 A CLINICO-ANALYTICAL STUDY ON SEED OF WRIGHTIA ANTIDYSENTERICA LINN. AS A THERAPEUTIC EMETIC AGENT (VAMAKA YOGA) IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS. OBJECTIVES: WRIGHTIA ANTIDYSENTERICA LINN. (WA) IS MALE VARIETY KUTAJA STATED TO BE POTENT THERAPEUTIC EMETIC AGENT IN SKIN DISORDERS. EXPULSION OF DOSHAS THROUGH ORAL ROUTE IS TERMED AS VAMANA KARMA (VK) (THERAPEUTIC EMESIS). HOWEVER, SO FAR, ITS UTILITY FOR VAMANA IS NOT EXPLORED IN DETAIL, THEREFORE THERE IS A NEED TO REVALIDATE THE UTILITY OF WA FOR VAMANA. HENCE, THE ABOVE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO ASCERTAIN THE EFFICACY AS A THERAPEUTIC EMETIC AGENT (VAMAKA YOGA) IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PSORIASIS ALONG WITH QUALITY CONTROL AND STANDARDIZATION OF THIS HERB. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE DRUG WAS STANDARDIZED AS PER ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES IN PHARMACOPEIAS. THIRTY PATIENTS OF PSORIASIS FULFILLING INCLUSION CRITERIA WERE TAKEN FOR THE STUDY AND VAMANA WITH WA WAS CONDUCTED. CRITERIA WERE PREPARED TO ASSESS THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF PSORIASIS. VK WAS ASSESSED USING THE CLASSICAL LAKSHANAS (FEATURES) SUCH AS ANTHIKI SHUDHI (ENDING SYMPTOMS OF EMESIS), VAIGIKI SHUDHI (FEATURES OF VOMITING BOUTS), MANIKI SHUDHI (QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE PURIFICATION), COMPLICATIONS. RESULT: VK WITH WA SHOWED SIGNIFICANT RELIEF IN PARAMETERS OF PSORIASIS SUCH AS SCALING, ITCHING, CANDLE GREASE SIGN (P < 0.001), AND PSORIASIS AREA AND SEVERITY INDEX SCORE (P = 0.001). IN VK WITH WA, MEAN NUMBER OF VEGAS (VOMITING BOUTS) WAS 6.91. 66% PATIENTS SHOWING QUANTITATIVE PURIFICATION BETWEEN 301 AND 600 ML. 73.33% SHOWED ALL SYMPTOMS OF PURIFICATION. 73.33% PATIENTS SHOWED KAPHANTA VAMANA (MODERATE EXPULSION OF DESIRE HUMOR). IN THE LEVEL OF BIOPURIFICATION, 66.66% PATIENTS SHOWED MODERATED PURIFICATION. NO COMPLICATION WAS NOTED WITH MODERATE DRUG PALATABILITY. CONCLUSION: PHARMACOPEIAL ANALYTICAL STUDY SHOWED ITS STANDARDIZED VALUES FOR TESTING THE DRUG USED FOR THE STUDY. IT IS PROVED AS POTENT THERAPEUTIC EMETIC AGENT WITH NO COMPLICATION SHOWED ITS CLINICAL BENEFITS OVER SKIN DISORDER LIKE PSORIASIS. SUMMARY: SEEDS OF WRIGHTIA ANTIDYSENTERICA (WA) LINN. FREE FROM ANY FOREIGN MATTER WERE SELECTED FOR THE STUDY. LOSS ON DRYING REVEALED 6.535% MOISTURE CONTENT; TOTAL ASH INDICATING OF TOTAL INORGANIC CONTENT WAS FOUND TO BE 5.12%; ACID INSOLUBLE ASH IS THE ACID INSOLUBLE PART OF TOTAL ASH, MAINLY SILICA, WA SHOWED 0.393% ACID INSOLUBLE ASH; ETHANOL AND WATER SOLUBLE EXTRACTIVE IS INDICATIVE OF PERCENTAGE ACTIVE CONSTITUENTS WERE FOUND TO BE 25.66 AND 20.854%, RESPECTIVELY. HIGH-PERFORMANCE THIN LAYER CHROMATOGRAPHY FINGERPRINTING PROFILES OF WA UNDER 254 NM SHOWED THE PRESENCE OF 7 SPOTS (ALL IN GREEN) AT RF VALUES RANGING FROM 0.21 TO 0.88. UNDER 366 NM THERE WERE 4 PROMINENT SPOTS (ALL IN FLUORESCENT) AT RF 0.49 TO 0.82 AND, WHEN SCANNED UNDER WHITE LIGHT 620 NM FOLLOWING DERIVATIZATION WITH VANILLIN SULFURIC ACID 6 SPOTS (IN DIFFERENT COLORS) WERE EVIDENT AT RF 0.28 TO 0.58. AMONG THESE SPOT WITH RF OF 0.58 WAS COMMON WHEN VISUALIZED UNDER ALL THE THREE METHODS. RF VALUES BY DENSITOMETRIC SCAN OF WA SHOWED 12 PEAKS AT 254 NM AND 5 PEAKS AT 366 NM. HOWEVER, IN CLINICAL TRIAL, IT WAS FOUND TO BE A POTENT EMETIC AGENT WITHOUT ANY COMPLICATION. ABBREVIATIONS USED: WA: WRIGHTIA ANTIDYSENTERICA; LINN.; VK: VAMANA KARMA; BT: BEFORE TREATMENT; FP: FREIDMAN'S P VALUE; CHS: CHI-SQUARE VALUE; NR: NEGATIVE RANKS; PR: POSITIVE RANKS; N: SAMPLE NUMBER, AS: AUSTIPZ SIGN; CG: CANDLE GREASE TEST; SSL: SAMYAK SNIGDHA LAKSHANA.	2016	

2  484  27 CLINICAL EVALUATION OF THE EFFICACY OF KHADIRADI YOGA AVACHOORNANA IN KACHCHU WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO GENITOINGUINAL INTERTRIGO. KACHCHU IS A SIMPLE LOCALIZED DERMATOLOGICAL INFECTION OF THE GENITOINGUINAL REGION, WHICH OCCURS BECAUSE OF UNHYGIENIC OBSERVANCE, AND MANIFESTS IN THE FORM OF INFLAMMATION FOLLOWED BY SECONDARY BACTERIAL OR FUNGAL INFECTIONS THAT CAN BE BEST CORRELATED TO GENITOINGUINAL INTERTRIGO. EVEN THOUGH IT RARELY CAUSES SYSTEMIC MANIFESTATIONS, ITS MERE PRESENCE ITSELF IS DISTURBING BECAUSE OF INTRACTABLE ITCHING AND PAIN. IT MAY DELAY THE PROPER HEALING OF THE EPISIOTOMY WOUND AND MAY CAUSE DIFFICULTY IN WALKING BECAUSE OF SEVERE PAIN. CANDIDA POWDER IS THE HIGHEST SELLING MEDICINE FOR THE INTERTRIGO, AS THE INCIDENCE OF INTERTRIGO IS AS HIGH AS 40% IN SOME PARTICULAR SEASONS. IN THE AYURVEDA FRATERNITY, THERE IS NO ESTABLISHED PREPARATION THAT CAN BE PRESERVED SAFELY IN ALL THE EPOCHS OF LIFE IN FEMALES AND WHICH IS EASY TO APPLY. AFTER UNDERSTANDING THE DISEASE IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE AYURVEDIC AND MODERN MEDICINAL SYSTEMS, KHADIRADI YOGA CHOORNA - A NEW AYURVEDIC FORMULATION - WAS PREPARED ON THE BASIS OF STRINGENT AYURVEDIC PRINCIPLES. HENCE, AN ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE TO STUDY THE EFFICACY OF THE KHADIRADI YOGA AVACHURNANA(1) IN KACHCHU, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO GENITOINGUINAL INTERTRIGO IN FEMALES.	2010

IS ONE OF THE MOST CELEBRATED HERBS IN THE INDIAN SYSTEM OF TRADITIONAL MEDICINE. IT IS ONE OF THE BEST RASAYANA-S (HEALTH PROMOTING) DRUG. IN DUGDHAMALAKYADI YOGA, AMALAKI (EMBELICA OFFICINALIS GAERTN.) POWDER IS ADMINISTERED ALONG WITH MILK IN CASE OF SVARABHANGA (HOARSENESS OF VOICE). HERE AN ATTEMPT IS MADE TO CONVERT THIS FORMULATION INTO CHEWABLE TABLET WITHOUT ALTERING ITS PROPERTY TO IMPROVE ITS PALATABILITY, SHELF LIFE AND FIXATION OF PROPER THERAPEUTIC DOSE. METHODOLOGY: CHEWABLE TABLETS WERE PREPARED BY WET GRANULATION METHOD. HERE, AMALAKI POWDER WAS PREPARED INITIALLY AND IT WAS MIXED WITH ADDITIVES AND PRESERVATIVES. GRANULES WERE PREPARED FROM THIS MIXTURE BY ADDING BINDING AGENT, FINALLY COMPRESSED IN TO TABLETS. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: THE PHYSICO-CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF AMALAKI STANDARD ARE: FOREIGN MATTER-NIL, ACID INSOLUBLE ASH-0.51%W/W, WATER SOLUBLE ASH-2.01% W/W, ALCOHOLIC EXTRACTIVES-44.48%, AQUEOUS EXTRACTIVES 67.52%, PH-3.1, MOISTURE CONTENT-8.19%. QUALITY CONTROL TEST FOR CHEWABLE TABLET WAS CARRIED OUT AND FOUND SATISFACTORY WITH GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF TABLET VIZ. HARDNESS 1.8, DISINTEGRATION TIME 15-20 MIN, FRIABILITY 0.5%, WEIGHT VARIATION +/- 3%. THE TLC OF AMALAKI POWDER SHOWED 3 SPOTS WITH RF VALUE 0.14, 0.4, AND 0.73 AND THE CHEWABLE TABLETS SHOWED 2 SPOTS WITH RF VALUE 0.31 AND 0.89 UNDER 254 NM. THE ADAPTATION OF MODERN TECHNIQUES OR METHODS TO CONVERT THE AYURVEDIC FORMULATIONS WITHOUT ALTERING ITS THERAPEUTIC PROPERTY IS NECESSARY TO MADE THEM SUITABLE FOR THE PRESENT TRENDS OF NEWER DRUG DELIVERY DOSAGE FORMS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
4  483  53 CLINICAL EFFICACY OF VAMANA KARMA WITH IKSHWAAKU BEEJA YOGA FOLLOWED BY SHATAPUSHPADI GHANAVATI IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ARTAVA KSHAYA W. S. R TO POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME. BACKGROUND: DUE TO SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE AND STRESS, THE INCIDENCE OF METABOLIC DISORDERS ARE INCREASING DAY BY DAY. AMONG THESE POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME (PCOS) IS AN INTRICATE DISORDER AFFECTING 4%-8% WOMEN IN THEIR REPRODUCTIVE AGE AND RELATED TO OVARIAN DYSFUNCTION CHARACTERIZED BY OBESITY, OLIGOMENORRHEA, ANOVULATION AND HYPERANDROGENISM. IN MODERN SYSTEM OF MEDICINE, THE AVAILABLE ALLOPATHIC REGIMEN HAS ITS OWN LIMITATIONS, SO IT IS NEED OF TIME TO FIND A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE THERAPY FOR SUCH TYPE OF CONDITION. THE MOST COMMON SYMPTOM IN 85%-90% OF PCOS PATIENTS IS OLIGOMENORRHEA WHICH CAN BE CORRELATED TO ARTAVA KSHAYA (LOSS OF MENSTRUAL FLUID) IN AYURVEDA. HENCE, IN THE PRESENT CLINICAL STUDY, VAMANA KARMA (THERAPEUTIC VOMITING) WITH IKSHWAAKU SEED FORMULATION FOLLOWED BY SHATAPUSHPADI GHANAVATI WAS PLANNED. AIMS: TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF VAMANA KARMA (THERAPEUTIC VOMITING) FOLLOWED BY SHATAPUSHPADI GHANAVATI IN THE MANAGEMENT OF AARTAVA KSHAYA (LOSS OF MENSTRUAL FLUID) W. S. R TO PCOS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 15 PATIENTS OF PCOS WERE CLINICALLY DIAGNOSED AND TREATED BY VAMANA KARMA (THERAPEUTIC VOMITING) PROCEDURE WITH IKSHWAAKU SEED FORMULATION. AFTER COMPLETION OF VAMANA KARMA (THERAPEUTIC VOMITING) AND SAMSARJANA KRAMA, (POST THERAPY DIETARY REGIMEN FOR REVIVAL) SHATAPUSHPADI GHANAVATI 2 VATI (EACH 500 MG) TWICE IN A DAY WITH LUKEWARM WATER WAS GIVEN FOR 45 DAYS. AFTER COMPLETION OF 2-MONTH TRIAL, ASSESSMENT OF THERAPY WAS ESTIMATED BY SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE PARAMETERS. RESULTS: STATISTICALLY EXTREMELY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.0001) RESULTS WERE FOUND IN MENSTRUAL IRREGULARITIES, OBESITY, AND BODY MASS INDEX. THE SIGNIFICANT RESULT IN REDUCTION OF NONDOMINANT FOLLICLES (P = 0.01 AND 0.03 FOR RIGHT AND LEFT OVARY, RESPECTIVELY), LOWERING THE FASTING BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL (P = 0.02) AND HIRSUTISM (P = 0.03) WAS FOUND. CONCLUSION: VAMANA KARMA (THERAPEUTIC VOMITING) FOLLOWED BY SHATAPUSHPADI GHANAVATI IS VERY EFFECTIVE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF OBESE PCOS PATIENTS AND INCREASING CHANCES OF CONCEPTION.	2017

POST DIAGNOSIS OF ACC PATIENT WAS ADVISED TO UNDERGO CHOLECYSTECTOMY; HOWEVER, SHE APPROACHED ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES WITH C/O VOMITING, NAUSEA, ABDOMINAL PAIN, JAUNDICE, ITCHING, AND ABDOMINAL BLOATING WITH DERANGED LIVER FUNCTIONS. AYURVEDA AND YOGA INTERVENTION PROTOCOL WAS DESIGNED. AYURVEDA TREATMENT CONSISTED OF MILD PURGATION (MRUDUVIRECHANA) WITH TRIVRITTALEHYAM FOR CONSECUTIVE SEVEN DAYS, FOLLOWED BY ORAL ADMINISTRATION OF TAB LIV 52, BHUNIMBADI KADHA TWICE DAILY, AND AMALAKI RASAYANA IN THE MORNING FOR 45 DAYS. PATIENTS RECEIVED 8 TELEYOGA SESSIONS OVER A PERIOD OF 45 DAYS. A THERAPEUTIC DIET WAS ADVISED DURING TREATMENT PERIOD. AFTER TWO MONTHS PATIENT REPORTED COMPLETE RECOVERY IN SYMPTOMS, AND ALL LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS REACHED TO NORMAL RANGE. THIS CASE STUDY SUGGESTS THE POSITIVE ROLE OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA INTERVENTION IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ACC. THIS CASE REPORT WARRANTS FUTURE CLINICAL STUDIES ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE IN ACC.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
6 2283  42 THE USE OF INTEGRATIVE THERAPY BASED ON YOGA AND AYURVEDA IN THE TREATMENT OF A HIGH-RISK CASE OF COVID-19/SARS-COV-2 WITH MULTIPLE COMORBIDITIES: A CASE REPORT. BACKGROUND: WE REPORT A HIGH-RISK CASE OF A CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 19 (COVID-19)-POSITIVE PATIENT WITH COMORBIDITIES INCLUDING DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), HYPERTENSION (HTN), HYPOTHYROIDISM AND CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (CKD), TREATED SUCCESSFULLY USING AN INTEGRATIVE THERAPY PLAN BASED ON AYURVEDA AND YOGA, ALONG WITH GOVERNMENT-MANDATED COMPULSORY MODERN WESTERN MEDICINE (MWM) TREATMENT. RECENTLY, SOME EVIDENCE HAS BEEN EMERGING ON THE USE OF AYURVEDA FOR TREATMENT OF COVID-19. THE CLASSICAL TEXTS OF AYURVEDIC MEDICINE SUCH AS CHARAKA SAMHITA AND SUSHRUTA SAMHITA CONTAIN DESCRIPTIONS OF PANDEMICS OF SIMILAR PROPORTIONS AND DESCRIBE THEM AS JANAPADODDHVANSA, MEANING THE DESTRUCTION OF COMMUNITIES, ALONG WITH THEIR CAUSES AND TREATMENT. CASE PRESENTATION: THE CASE REPORTED HEREIN IS A 55-YEAR-OLD MAN FROM DELHI, INDIA, WITH CONFIRMED (TESTED) COVID-19, WHO FIRST TOOK MWM FOR 7 DAYS BEFORE SEEKING INTEGRATIVE THERAPY. THE PATIENT HAS COMORBIDITIES INCLUDING DM, HTN, HYPOTHYROIDISM AND CKD AND HAD DEVELOPED SYMPTOMS INCLUDING FEVER (WHICH WAS RESOLVED BY THE TIME INTEGRATIVE THERAPY WAS STARTED), SORE THROAT, DRY COUGH, BODY ACHES, WEAKNESS, BAD TASTE AND SMELL, AND HEAVINESS IN THE ABDOMEN. BASED ON THE PATIENT'S SYMPTOMS AND COMORBIDITIES, A TREATMENT PLAN INCLUDING AYURVEDIC MEDICINES, YOGA PROTOCOL, DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS AND LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS WAS PRESCRIBED BY A REGISTERED AYURVEDA DOCTOR AND A YOGA CONSULTANT. THE PATIENT STARTED EXPERIENCING IMPROVEMENT IN ALL THE SYMPTOMS WITHIN 2 DAYS AFTER STARTING THE TREATMENT; HE REPORTED APPROXIMATELY [FORMULA: SEE TEXT] RELIEF FROM THE SYMPTOMS AFTER 5 DAYS, AND ALMOST COMPLETE RELIEF WITHIN 9 DAYS. ALSO, THE BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS (BOTH FASTING BLOOD SUGAR [FBS] AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD SUGAR [PPBS]) EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT AFTER 5 DAYS, AND DECREASED TO WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE WITHIN 12 DAYS. BESIDES RELIEF IN SYMPTOMS, THE PATIENT'S REAL-TIME REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (RT-PCR) TEST DONE ON THE 19TH DAY RETURNED NEGATIVE RESULTS. CONCLUSIONS: INTEGRATIVE THERAPY WAS FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE IN MITIGATING THE SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19 IN THIS PATIENT WITH MULTIPLE COMORBIDITIES. MOREOVER, A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS (NOT UNDER CONTROL WITH MODERN MEDICINE) WAS ALSO ACHIEVED. INTEGRATIVE THERAPY BASED ON THE CLASSICAL TEXTS OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA MAY OFFER A PROMISING AND SCALABLE TREATMENT OPTION FOR COVID-19 PATIENTS. A CASE SERIES OR A SUITABLY DESIGNED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IS NEEDED TO ASSESS ITS EFFICACY.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
7 1347  27 HYPOXIA IN CNS PATHOLOGIES: EMERGING ROLE OF MIRNA-BASED NEUROTHERAPEUTICS AND YOGA BASED ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES. CELLULAR RESPIRATION IS A VITAL PROCESS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF LIFE. ANY CONDITION THAT RESULTS IN DEPRIVATION OF OXYGEN (ALSO TERMED AS HYPOXIA) MAY EVENTUALLY LEAD TO DELETERIOUS EFFECTS ON THE FUNCTIONING OF TISSUES. BRAIN BEING THE HIGHEST CONSUMER OF OXYGEN IS PRONE TO INCREASED RISK OF HYPOXIA-INDUCED NEUROLOGICAL INSULTS. THIS IN TURN HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH MANY DISEASES OF CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) SUCH AS STROKE, ALZHEIMER'S, ENCEPHALOPATHY ETC. ALTHOUGH SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS UNDERLYING ISCHEMIC/HYPOXIC CNS DISEASES, THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT PROTECTIVE THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES TO AMELIORATE THE AFFECTED NEURONAL CELLS IS MEAGER. THIS HAS AUGMENTED THE NEED TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE HYPOXIC AND ISCHEMIC EVENTS OCCURRING IN THE BRAIN AND IDENTIFY NOVEL AND ALTERNATE TREATMENT MODALITIES FOR SUCH INSULTS. MICRORNA (MIRNAS), SMALL NON-CODING RNA MOLECULES, HAVE RECENTLY EMERGED AS POTENTIAL NEUROPROTECTIVE AGENTS AS WELL AS TARGETS, UNDER HYPOXIC CONDITIONS. THESE 18-22 NUCLEOTIDE LONG RNA MOLECULES ARE PROFUSELY PRESENT IN BRAIN AND OTHER ORGANS AND FUNCTION AS GENE REGULATORS BY CLEAVING AND SILENCING THE GENE EXPRESSION. IN BRAIN, THESE ARE KNOWN TO BE INVOLVED IN NEURONAL DIFFERENTIATION AND PLASTICITY. THEREFORE, TARGETING MIRNA EXPRESSION REPRESENTS A NOVEL THERAPEUTIC APPROACH TO INTERCEDE AGAINST HYPOXIC AND ISCHEMIC BRAIN INJURY. IN THE FIRST PART OF THIS REVIEW, WE WILL DISCUSS THE NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES CAUSED AS A RESULT OF HYPOXIA, FOLLOWED BY THE CONTRIBUTION OF HYPOXIA IN THE NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES. SECONDLY, WE WILL PROVIDE RECENT UPDATES AND INSIGHTS INTO THE ROLES OF MIRNA IN THE REGULATION OF GENES IN OXYGEN AND GLUCOSE DEPRIVED BRAIN IN ASSOCIATION WITH CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS AND HOW THESE CAN BE TARGETED AS NEUROPROTECTIVE AGENTS FOR CNS INJURIES. FINALLY, WE WILL EMPHASIZE ON ALTERNATE BREATHING OR YOGIC INTERVENTIONS TO OVERCOME THE HYPOXIA ASSOCIATED ANOMALIES THAT COULD ULTIMATELY LEAD TO IMPROVEMENT IN CEREBRAL PERFUSION.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
8  373  29 AYURVEDA AND YOGA IN CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES. AYURVEDA IS DERIVED FROM 2 SANSKRIT WORDS, NAMELY, "AYUS" AND "VEDA," MEANING LIFE AND KNOWLEDGE, RESPECTIVELY. IT LITERALLY MEANS SCIENCE OF LIFE. AYURVEDA, OF WHICH YOGA IS AN INTEGRAL PART, IS WIDELY PRACTICED IN INDIA AND IS GAINING ACCEPTANCE IN MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. IT IS A COMPREHENSIVE AND A HOLISTIC SYSTEM, THE FOCUS OF WHICH IS ON THE BODY, MIND, AND CONSCIOUSNESS. THE AYURVEDIC TREATMENT CONSISTS OF THE USE HERBAL PREPARATIONS, DIET, YOGA, MEDITATION, AND OTHER PRACTICES. BASED ON THE REVIEW OF AVAILABLE STUDIES, THE EVIDENCE IS NOT CONVINCING THAT ANY AYURVEDIC HERBAL TREATMENT IS EFFECTIVE IN THE TREATMENT OF HEART DISEASE OR HYPERTENSION. HOWEVER, THE USE OF CERTAIN SPICES AND HERBS SUCH AS GARLIC AND TURMERIC IN AN OVERALL HEALTHY DIET IS APPROPRIATE. MANY HERBS USED BY AYURVEDIC PRACTITIONERS SHOW PROMISE AND COULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR LARGER RANDOMIZED TRIALS. YOGA, AN INTEGRAL PART OF AYURVEDA, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE USEFUL TO PATIENTS WITH HEART DISEASE AND HYPERTENSION. YOGA REDUCES ANXIETY, PROMOTES WELL-BEING, AND IMPROVES QUALITY OF LIFE. ITS SAFETY PROFILE IS EXCELLENT. ITS USE AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPEUTIC REGIMEN UNDER MEDICAL SUPERVISION IS APPROPRIATE AND COULD BE WORTH CONSIDERING.	2005	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
9 1911  22 ROLE OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE IN THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC - A NARRATIVE REVIEW. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS POSED AN IMMENSE CHALLENGE TO HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AROUND THE GLOBE IN TERMS OF LIMITED HEALTH CARE FACILITIES AND PROVEN MEDICAL THERAPEUTICS TO ADDRESS THE SYMPTOMS OF THE INFECTION. THE CURRENT HEALTH CARE STRATEGIES ARE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON EITHER THE PATHOGEN OR THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. HOWEVER, EFFORTS TOWARDS STRENGTHENING THE HOST IMMUNITY ARE IMPORTANT FROM PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF INFECTION AND DOWNREGULATE THE POTENCY OF THE INFECTIOUS AGENT. WHILE A VACCINE CAN INDUCE SPECIFIC IMMUNITY IN THE HOST, NON-SPECIFIC WAYS OF IMPROVING OVERALL HOST IMMUNITY ARE NEEDED AS WELL. THIS SCENARIO HAS PAVED THE WAY FOR THE USE OF TRADITIONAL INDIAN THERAPIES SUCH AS AYURVEDA AND YOGA. THIS REVIEW AIMS AT COLLATING AVAILABLE EVIDENCE ON AYURVEDA, YOGA, AND COVID-19. FURTHER, IT DRAWS INFERENCES FROM RECENT STUDIES ON YOGA AND AYURVEDA ON IMMUNITY, RESPIRATORY HEALTH, AND MENTAL HEALTH RESPECTIVELY TO APPROXIMATE ITS PROBABLE ROLE IN PROPHYLAXIS AND AS AN ADD-ON MANAGEMENT OPTION FOR THE CURRENT PANDEMIC.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
10 2486  31 YOGA AS AN INTEGRATIVE APPROACH FOR PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF ORAL CANCER. DESPITE TREMENDOUS ADVANCEMENTS IN MEDICINE, THE NUMBER OF ORAL CANCER CASES CONTINUES TO INCREASE, AND THE NEED FOR INTEGRATING ALTERNATE MEDICINE OR ADOPTING AN INTEGRATIVE APPROACH HAS BECOME A COMPELLING COST-EFFECTIVE REQUIREMENT FOR THE MANAGEMENT AND TREATMENT OF DISEASES. CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT OF ORAL CANCER INVOLVES SURGERY FOLLOWED BY RADIOTHERAPY WITH OR WITHOUT CHEMOTHERAPY WHICH CAUSES SEVERAL COMPLICATIONS INCLUDING POOR QUALITY OF LIFE AND HIGH CHANCES OF RECURRENCE OF CANCER. ORAL CANCER IS OFTEN LINKED WITH OBESITY WHICH IS MAJOR RISK FACTORS IN OTHER CANCERS. APART FROM OBESITY, ORAL CANCER IS THOUGHT TO HAVE AN INVERSE RELATION WITH NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS PRESUMABLY BECAUSE CELL DEATH DECREASES IN THE FORMER CASE AND INCREASES IN THE LATTER. ANCIENT MIND-BODY TECHNIQUES SUCH AS YOGA HAVE NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY TESTED AS A TOOL TO SYNERGIZE THE CELLULAR EQUILIBRIUM PERTAINING TO THE TREATMENT OF ORAL CANCER. NERVE GROWTH FACTOR (NGF), TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR-ALPHA (TNF-ALPHA), AND INTERLEUKIN-6 (IL-6) ARE AMONG THE EARLY EXPERIMENTAL CELLULAR BIOMARKERS THAT MAY BE USED TO PROBE THE MODULATION OF ORAL CANCER, OBESITY, AND NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS. YOGA HAS BEEN REPORTED TO INFLUENCE THESE MOLECULES IN HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS BUT WHETHER THEIR EXPRESSION CAN BE ALTERED IN PATIENTS OF ORAL CANCER BY YOGA INTERVENTION IS THE SUBJECT OF THIS RESEARCH BEING DISCUSSED IN THIS REVIEW ARTICLE. THEREFORE, THE PRESENT ARTICLE NOT ONLY REVIEWS THE CURRENT STATUS OF RESEARCH STUDIES IN ORAL CANCER, OBESITY, AND NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS BUT ALSO HOW THESE ARE LINKED TO EACH OTHER AND WHY THE INVESTIGATIONS OF THE PUTATIVE NGF PATHWAY, INVOLVING TNF-ALPHA AND IL-6, COULD PROVIDE USEFUL CLUES TO UNDERSTAND THE MOLECULAR EFFECTS BROUGHT ABOUT BY YOGA INTERVENTION IN SUCH PATIENTS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
11  924  20 EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN EATING DISORDERS - A CASE REPORT. EATING DISORDERS ARE AMONG THE MOST COMMON PSYCHOSOMATIC DISEASES AND ARE OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH NEGATIVE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES. THE USE OF YOGA AS A TREATMENT METHOD IN EATING DISORDERS IS CONTROVERSIAL DISCUSSED. THE INTERVIEWEE WAS A 38 YEAR OLD FEMALE PATIENT SUFFERING ON ANOREXIA NERVOSA AND VARIOUS PSYCHOSOMATIC-PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSES IN HER MEDICAL HISTORY. THE PATIENT REPORTED THAT YOGA RECOVERED THE SOUL CONTACT WHICH SHE LOST AND SHE HAD LEARNED TO PERCEIVE AND FEEL HERSELF AGAIN. SHE STATED THAT YOGA HELPED HER TO FIND ACCESS TO HER BODY AND ITS NEEDS AND TO COPE WITH HER TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES. SHE ALSO REPORTED THAT ATTITUDES HAVE CHANGED IN RELATION TO HER STOMACH IN THE TREATMENT OF HER ANOREXIA. THE CASE REPORT CONFIRMED THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF YOGA ON EATING DISORDERS. RESEARCH SHOULD PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE INFLUENCE OF INDIVIDUAL'S CO-MORBIDITIES, AS EATING DISORDERS USUALLY OCCUR IN ASSOCIATION WITH CO-MORBIDITIES.	2019

IT IS LIVING SCIENCE, PRACTICED IN AN ELEMENTARY FASHION BY MANY IN INDIA. WHILE A FEW PERHAPS ARE THERE WHO HAVE ATTAINED MASTERY OF THIS SCIENCE.THE BACKGROUND OF THE DERIVATION AND CONCEPT OF YOGA IN INDIA IS PRESENTED FOLLOWED BY A SIMPLE EXPOSITION OF YOGIC PRACTICES AND SOME POSSIBLE NEUROPHYSIOLOGIC EXPLANATIONS. RESEARCH IN YOGA WILL BE REWARDING AS IT GIVES MEANS OF EXPLORING AND ENLARGING THE FUNCTIONS OF THE HUMAN BRAIN.	1981	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
13  426  24 CAN YOGA BE USED TO TREAT GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE? YOGA METHODS INCLUDING PRANAYAMA ARE THE BEST WAYS TO PREVENT MANY DISEASES AND THEIR PROGRESSION. EVEN THOUGH, YOGA IS WIDELY PRACTICED, ITS EFFECTS ON CERTAIN MEDICAL CONDITIONS HAVE NOT BEEN STUDIED OR REPORTED. GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE (GERD) IS ONE OF THEM. GERD IS EXTREMELY COMMON CONDITION REQUIRING FREQUENT CONSUMPTION OF OVER-THE-COUNTER OR PRESCRIBED PROTON PUMP INHIBITORS (PPI). IN SEVERE SYMPTOMS OF GERD AND IN THE PRESENCE OF MULTIPLE ETIOLOGIES, PPIS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO RELIEVE THE SYMPTOMS OF GASTRIC REFLUX. REGULAR AND PROPER USE OF THE YOGA ALONG WITH PPI CAN CONTROL THE SEVERE SYMPTOMS OF GERD AND CAN AVOID OR DELAY THE NECESSITY OF INVASIVE PROCEDURES. THIS EVIDENCE-BASED CASE REPORT FOCUSES ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON GERD. OUR CASE REPORT SHOWED THAT REGULAR PRACTICE OF KAPALBHATI AND AGNISAR KRIYA ALONG WITH PPI, PATIENTS WITH HIATAL HERNIA HAD IMPROVEMENT IN SEVERE SYMPTOMS OF GERD, WHICH WERE INITIALLY REFRACTORY TO PPI ALONE.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
14 2570  19 YOGA FOR DERMATOLOGIC CONDITIONS. AS BOTH A DERMATOLOGY RESIDENT AND YOGA INSTRUCTOR, I FIND THE POTENTIAL CORRELATION BETWEEN THE 2 DISCIPLINES TO BE INTERESTING AND A GROWING TOPIC OF ATTENTION IN THE MEDIA TODAY. WITH THE RISING TREND OF PRACTICING YOGA, WHICH ENCOMPASSES PHYSICAL POSTURES, BREATHING EXERCISES, AND MEDITATION OR MINDFULNESS, IT IS INEVITABLE THAT PATIENTS WILL INQUIRE ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF YOGA IN MANAGING DERMATOLOGIC PROBLEMS. IN THIS COLUMN, I WILL DISCUSS THE DERMATOLOGIC MANIFESTATIONS OF STRESS AS WELL AS THE KNOWN HEALTH BENEFITS OF YOGA AS DESCRIBED IN THE LITERATURE SO THAT RESIDENTS MAY OFFER AN OBJECTIVE OPINION ABOUT YOGA IN RESPONSE TO PATIENT INQUIRIES.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
15 1768  25 POTENTIAL FOR INTEGRATING YOGA WITHIN PULMONARY REHABILITATION AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF REPORTING FRAMEWORK. THERE IS A RISING BURDEN OF CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD) IN INDIA. PULMONARY REHABILITATION (PR), IS A UNIVERSALLY RECOMMENDED MULTIDISCIPLINARY THERAPEUTIC STRATEGY FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF COPD; HOWEVER, ITS NEEDS ARE UNMET. THE DIVERSITY IN THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS, AVAILABILITY OF PR SPECIALISTS AND SOCIOCULTURAL MULTIFORMITY REQUIRES CONTEXTUALISED AND INNOVATIVE PR MODELS. CULTURALLY SENSITIVE ELEMENTS, SUCH AS YOGA, HAVE SOME EVIDENCE OF A POSITIVE IMPACT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF COPD. YOGA AND PR ARE BASED ON SIMILAR PRINCIPLES WITH A HOLISTIC APPROACH OF INVOLVING PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES, BEHAVIOUR CHANGE TECHNIQUES AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORT TO IMPROVE DISEASE OUTCOMES. ARGUABLY THE PRINCIPLES OF PR AND YOGA ARE COMPLEMENTARY BUT THERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES IN THE INTENSITIES OF ACTIVITIES, EXERCISE TYPES AND INCLUSION OF MINDFULNESS IN COMPONENTS THAT MUST BE CONSIDERED. COMPONENTS OF PR ENABLE AEROBIC CAPACITY BUILDING, STRENGTHENING OF MUSCLES OF THE UPPER AND LOWER EXTREMITIES AND BUILDING AWARENESS TOWARDS DISEASE MANAGEMENT. YOGA, ON THE OTHER HAND, PRIMARILY CAN FOCUS ON CORE STRENGTHENING, BREATHING CONTROL, MINDFULNESS AND SELF-AWARENESS. WE DISCUSS THE POTENTIAL OF INTEGRATING THE SOCIOCULTURAL APPEAL OF YOGA WITH PR DELIVERED AT INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS, AND HOW AN INTEGRATED APPROACH MAY LEAD TO OPTIMAL REFERRAL, UPTAKE AND COMPLETION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
16  433  26 CAN YOGA THERAPY STIMULATE STEM CELL TRAFFICKING FROM BONE MARROW? IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT MESENCHYMAL STROMAL CELLS (MSCS) FROM BONE MARROW ENTER THE PERIPHERAL CIRCULATION INTERMITTENTLY FOR POSSIBLE TISSUE REGENERATION, REPAIR AND TO TAKE CARE OF DAILY WEAR AND TEAR. THIS IS EVIDENT FROM THE DETECTION OF MSCS FROM PERIPHERAL BLOOD. THE FACTORS GOVERNING THIS MIGRATION REMAIN ELUSIVE. THESE MSCS CARRY OUT THE WORK OF POLICING AND ARE SUPPOSED TO REPAIR THE INJURED TISSUES. THUS, THESE CELLS HELP IN MAINTAINING THE TISSUE AND ORGAN HOMEOSTASIS. YOGA AND PRANAYAMA ORIGINATED IN INDIA AND IS NOW BEING PRACTICED ALL OVER THE WORLD FOR POSITIVE HEALTH. SO FAR, THE CHEMICAL STIMULATION OF BONE MARROW HAS BEEN WIDELY USED EMPLOYING INJECTION OF COLONY STIMULATING FACTOR. HOWEVER, THE ROLE OF PHYSICAL FACTORS SUCH AS MECHANICAL STIMULATION AND STRETCHING HAS NOT BEEN SUBSTANTIATED. IT IS CLAIMED THAT PRACTICING YOGA DELAYS SENESCENCE, IMPROVES THE PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS OF HEART AND LUNG AND YOGA POSTURES MAKE THE BODY ELASTIC. IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER THE YOGA THERAPY PROMOTES TRAFFICKING OF THE STEM CELLS FROM BONE MARROW FOR POSSIBLE REPAIR AND REGENERATION OF WORN OUT AND DEGENERATING TISSUES. WE COVER IN THIS SHORT REVIEW, MAINLY THE ROLE OF PHYSICAL FACTORS ESPECIALLY THE YOGA THERAPY ON STEM CELLS TRAFFICKING FROM BONE MARROW.	2016

18 1525  24 IYENGAR YOGA AND THE USE OF PROPS FOR PEDIATRIC CHRONIC PAIN: A CASE STUDY. IYENGAR YOGA USES POSTURES AND PROPS TO SUPPORT THE BODY SO THAT PRACTITIONERS CAN ENGAGE IN POSES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE MORE DIFFICULT. THIS TYPE OF YOGA MAY BE USEFUL IN TREATING CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WHO HAVE CHRONIC PAIN AND DISABILITY. IN THIS CASE STUDY, THE AUTHORS DISCUSS A 14-Y-OLD GIRL WHO HAD TWO SURGERIES FOR GASTRO-ESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE (GERD) AND WHO HAD CONTINUED CHEST AND ABDOMINAL PAIN, AS WELL AS VOMITING, DIFFICULTY EATING, WEIGHT LOSS, AND ANXIETY. HAVING SIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIRED FUNCTIONING, SHE WAS UNABLE TO ATTEND SCHOOL, SLEEP, SOCIALIZE, OR EAT, AND SHE HAD BECOME WHEELCHAIR-BOUND. DESPITE EVALUATIONS AND TREATMENTS BY SPECIALISTS OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, HER SYMPTOMS HAD NOT IMPROVED. THIS CASE HISTORY DESCRIBES HOW THE AUTHORS USED A 4-MO TREATMENT OF IYENGAR YOGA TO HELP THE ADOLESCENT RESUME ACTIVITIES AND RE-ENGAGE WITH HER ENVIRONMENT. THE AUTHORS INTEND THIS REPORT TO STIMULATE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF THIS FORM OF TREATMENT FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH CHRONIC PAIN.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
19 1918  26 ROLE OF YOGA AND MEDITATION AS COMPLIMENTARY THERAPEUTIC REGIME FOR STRESS-RELATED NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS: UTILIZATION OF BRAIN WAVES ACTIVITY AS NOVEL TOOL. DURING RECENT DECADES, STRESS-RELATED NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS SUCH AS ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, CHRONIC TENSION HEADACHE, AND MIGRAINE HAVE ESTABLISHED THEIR STRONGHOLD IN THE LIVES OF A VAST NUMBER OF PEOPLE WORLDWIDE. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS GLOBAL PHENOMENON, INTENSIVE STUDIES HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT LEADING TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF DRUGS LIKE ANTI-DEPRESSANTS, ANXIOLYTICS, AND ANALGESICS WHICH ALTHOUGH HELP IN COMBATING THE SYMPTOMS OF SUCH DISORDERS BUT ALSO CREATE LONG-TERM SIDE EFFECTS. THUS, AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO SUCH CLINICAL PRACTICES, VARIOUS COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES SUCH AS YOGA AND MEDITATION HAVE BEEN PROVED TO BE EFFECTIVE IN ALLEVIATING THE CAUSES AND SYMPTOMS OF DIFFERENT NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS. THE ROLE OF ALTERED BRAIN WAVES IN THIS CONTEXT HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AND NEEDS TO BE PURSUED AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL.

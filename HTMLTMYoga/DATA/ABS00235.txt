1  235 143 A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR HELPING HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND STUDENTS. HELPING HEALTH PROFESSIONALS (HHP) AND HHP STUDENTS ARE AMONG THE HIGHEST RISK OCCUPATIONAL GROUPS FOR COMPROMISED MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH. THERE IS A PAUCITY OF INFORMATION REGARDING PREVENTIVE INTERVENTIONS FOR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH IN THIS GROUP OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR THE PREVENTION AND REDUCTION OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL DISORDERS AMONG HHPS AND HHP STUDENTS. DESIGN: AN EXHAUSTIVE SYSTEMATIC SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED IN MAY 2020. DATABASES SEARCHED IN THE OVID INTERFACE INCLUDED: MEDLINE(R) AND EPUB AHEAD OF PRINT, IN-PROCESS & OTHER NON-INDEXED CITATIONS AND DAILY, EMBASE, AND PSYCINFO. EBSCOHOST DATABASES SEARCHED INCLUDED: CINAHL PLUS WITH FULL TEXT, SPORTDISCUS WITH FULL TEXT, ALT HEALTHWATCH, EDUCATION RESEARCH COMPLETE, SOCINDEX WITH FULL TEXT, ERIC, AND ACADEMIC SEARCH COMPLETE. SCOPUS WAS ALSO SEARCHED. RESULTS: THE SEARCH YIELDED 4,973 RECORDS, AND AFTER REMOVAL OF DUPLICATES 3197 RECORDS REMAINED. USING INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA, TITLES AND ABSTRACTS WERE SCREENED AND FULL TEXT ARTICLES (N = 82) WERE RETRIEVED AND SCREENED. TWENTY-FIVE STUDIES WERE IDENTIFIED FOR INCLUSION IN THIS REVIEW. MOST FREQUENTLY REPORTED FINDINGS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN THIS POPULATION INCLUDED A REDUCTION IN STRESS, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN. CONCLUSION: IT IS OUR CONCLUSION THAT MENTAL AND PHYSICAL BENEFITS CAN BE OBTAINED THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR HHPS AND HHP STUDENTS ACROSS A VARIETY OF SETTINGS AND BACKGROUNDS. HOWEVER, RESEARCHERS WOULD BENEFIT FROM FOLLOWING RECOMMENDED GUIDELINES FOR THE DESIGN AND REPORTING OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE STUDY QUALITY AND RIGOUR.	2021	
                                                                                      
2 1737  40 PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND YOGA-BASED APPROACHES FOR PREGNANCY-RELATED LOW BACK AND PELVIC PAIN. OBJECTIVE: TO CONDUCT AN INTEGRATIVE REVIEW TO EVALUATE CURRENT LITERATURE ABOUT NONPHARMACOLOGIC, EASILY ACCESSIBLE MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES FOR PREGNANCY-RELATED LOW BACK AND PELVIC PAIN (PR-LBPP). DATA SOURCES: PUBMED, CINAHL, COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS. STUDY SELECTION: ORIGINAL RESEARCH ARTICLES WERE CONSIDERED FOR REVIEW IF THEY WERE FULL-LENGTH PUBLICATIONS WRITTEN IN ENGLISH AND PUBLISHED IN PEER-REVIEWED JOURNALS FROM 2005 THROUGH 2015, INCLUDED MEASURES OF PAIN AND SYMPTOMS RELATED TO PR-LBPP, AND EVALUATED TREATMENT MODALITIES THAT USED A PHYSICAL EXERCISE OR YOGA-BASED APPROACH FOR THE DESCRIBED CONDITIONS. DATA EXTRACTION: ELECTRONIC DATABASE SEARCHES YIELDED 1,435 ARTICLES. A TOTAL OF 15 ARTICLES MET ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR FURTHER REVIEW. DATA SYNTHESIS: THESE MODALITIES SHOW PRELIMINARY PROMISE FOR PAIN RELIEF AND OTHER RELATED SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING STRESS AND DEPRESSION. HOWEVER, OUR FINDINGS ALSO INDICATE SEVERAL GAPS IN KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THESE THERAPIES FOR PR-LBPP AND METHODOLOGIC ISSUES WITH THE CURRENT LITERATURE. CONCLUSION: ALTHOUGH ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS REQUIRED, THE RESULTS OF THIS INTEGRATIVE REVIEW SUGGEST THAT CLINICIANS MAY CONSIDER RECOMMENDING NONPHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT OPTIONS, SUCH AS GENTLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS, FOR PR-LBPP AND RELATED SYMPTOMS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
3  237  37 A SYSTEMATIC SCOPING REVIEW OF YOGA INTERVENTION COMPONENTS AND STUDY QUALITY. CONTEXT: THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF YOGA REQUIRES RIGOROUS METHODOLOGY. THIS REVIEW AIMED TO SYSTEMATICALLY ASSESS ALL STUDIES OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS TO (1) DETERMINE YOGA INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS; (2) EXAMINE METHODOLOGIC QUALITY OF THE SUBSET OF RCTS; AND (3) EXPLORE HOW WELL THESE INTERVENTIONS ARE REPORTED. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: SEARCHES WERE CONDUCTED THROUGH APRIL 2012 IN PUBMED, PSYCINFO, AGELINE, AND OVID'S ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE DATABASE USING THE TEXT TERM YOGA, AND THROUGH HANDSEARCHING FIVE JOURNALS. ORIGINAL STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IF THE INTERVENTION (1) CONSISTED OF AT LEAST ONE YOGA SESSION WITH SOME TYPE OF HEALTH ASSESSMENT; (2) TARGETED ADULTS AGED >/=18 YEARS; (3) WAS PUBLISHED IN AN ENGLISH-LANGUAGE PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL; AND (4) WAS AVAILABLE FOR REVIEW. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: OF 3,062 STUDIES IDENTIFIED, 465 STUDIES IN 30 COUNTRIES WERE INCLUDED. ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED THROUGH 2013. MOST INTERVENTIONS TOOK PLACE IN INDIA (N=228) OR THE U.S. (N=124), WITH INTENSITY RANGING FROM A SINGLE YOGA SESSION UP TO TWO SESSIONS PER DAY. INTERVENTION LENGTHS RANGED FROM ONE SESSION TO 2 YEARS. ASANAS (POSES) WERE MENTIONED AS YOGA COMPONENTS IN 369 (79%) INTERVENTIONS, BUT WERE EITHER MINIMALLY OR NOT AT ALL DESCRIBED IN 200 (54%) OF THESE. MOST INTERVENTIONS (74%, N=336) DID NOT INCLUDE HOME PRACTICE. OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES, 151 WERE RCTS. RCT QUALITY WAS RATED AS POOR. CONCLUSIONS: THIS REVIEW HIGHLIGHTS THE INADEQUATE REPORTING AND METHODOLOGIC LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT YOGA INTERVENTION RESEARCH, WHICH LIMITS STUDY INTERPRETATION AND COMPARABILITY. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE METHODOLOGY AND REPORTING ARE DISCUSSED.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                           
4 1435  34 IN SEARCH OF YOGA: RESEARCH TRENDS IN A WESTERN MEDICAL DATABASE. CONTEXT: THE PROMOTION OF YOGA PRACTICE AS A PREVENTATIVE AND TREATMENT THERAPY FOR HEALTH OUTCOMES IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE IS INCREASING RAPIDLY. AS THE COMMERCIAL SUCCESS OF YOGA BURGEONS IN POPULAR CULTURE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO INVESTIGATE THE TRENDS OF YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION IN ACADEMIC LITERATURE. THE FREE-ACCESS SEARCH ENGINE, PUBMED IS A PREEMINENT RESOURCE TO IDENTIFY HEALTH-RELATED RESEARCH ARTICLES PUBLISHED FOR ACADEMICS, HEALTH PRACTITIONERS AND OTHERS. AIMS: TO REPORT THE RECENT YOGA-RELATED PUBLICATIONS IN THE WESTERN HEALTHCARE CONTEXT WITH PARTICULAR INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT AND TYPE OF YOGA TITLES. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS TO DESCRIBE THE ANNUAL TRENDS IN PUBLICATION ON PUBMED FROM JANUARY 1950 TO DECEMBER 2012. RESULTS: THE NUMBER OF YOGA-RELATED TITLES INCLUDED IN THE PUBMED DATABASE IS LIMITED UNTIL A MARKED INCREASE 2000 AND STEADY SURGE SINCE 2007. BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT MORE THAN 200 NEW TITLES ARE ADDED PER ANNUM SINCE 2011. SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND YOGA TRIALS ARE INCREASING EXPONENTIALLY, INDICATING A POTENTIAL INCREASE IN THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE. TITLES INCLUDING PAIN MANAGEMENT, STRESS OR ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND CANCER CONDITIONS ARE HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH YOGA AND HEALTHCARE RESEARCH. CONCLUSIONS: THE PREVALENCE OF YOGA RESEARCH IN WESTERN HEALTHCARE IS INCREASING. THE MARKED INCREASE IN VOLUME INDICATES THE NEED FOR MORE SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS OF THE LITERATURE IN TERMS OF QUALITY AND RESULTS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
5 1108  34 EFFECTS OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ON CANCER-ASSOCIATED COGNITIVE DECLINE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: TO SUMMARIZE AND EVALUATE EVIDENCE AVAILABLE ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CANCER-ASSOCIATED COGNITIVE DECLINE (CACD). RECENT FINDINGS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED USING FOUR DATABASES OF ARTICLES PUBLISHED BEFORE JANUARY 1, 2020. TEN ARTICLES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA (SIX RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS, TWO SINGLE-ARM STUDIES, ONE NON-RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, AND ONE CASE SERIES STUDY). STUDIES WERE PREDOMINANTLY CONDUCTED WITH BREAST CANCER PATIENTS USING LOW-INTENSITY HATHA YOGA PROGRAMS. OF THE 10 ARTICLES, FIVE REPORTED SOME POSITIVE EFFECTS ON CACD, BUT SIGNIFICANT BIASES WERE POSSIBLE DUE TO DESIGN SHORTCOMINGS. COHEN'S D EFFECT SIZES RANGED FROM |0.03| TO |0.74|. THE EVIDENCE TO DATE IS INSUFFICIENT TO SUGGEST THAT YOGA IS BENEFICIAL FOR ATTENUATING CACD. MORE RIGOROUS TRIALS CONTROLLING FOR NON-SPECIFIC FACTORS ARE WARRANTED. THE FIELD WOULD ALSO BENEFIT FROM EXAMINING SELF-DELIVERED MODES OF YOGA FOR TREATING CACD IN VARIOUS CANCER POPULATIONS TO ENHANCE PRACTICE SUSTAINABILITY AND GENERALIZABILITY.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
6 2178  39 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PAIN, MOBILITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVE. TO SYSTEMATICALLY ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PAIN, MOBILITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS. METHODS. PUBMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE, THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS, PHYSIOTHERAPY EVIDENCE DATABASE (PEDRO), AND OTHER SOURCES WERE SEARCHED SYSTEMATICALLY IN THIS STUDY. TWO REVIEWERS IDENTIFIED ELIGIBLE STUDIES AND EXTRACTED DATA INDEPENDENTLY. DOWNS AND BLACK'S QUALITY INDEX WERE USED TO EVALUATE THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES. RESULTS. A TOTAL OF 9 ARTICLES (6 STUDIES) INVOLVING 372 PATIENTS WITH KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. THE MOST COMMON YOGA PROTOCOL IS 40~90 MINUTES/SESSION, LASTING FOR AT LEAST 8 WEEKS. THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON PAIN RELIEF AND FUNCTION IMPROVEMENT COULD BE SEEN AFTER TWO-WEEK INTERVENTION. CONCLUSION. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW SHOWED THAT YOGA MIGHT HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS IN RELIEVING PAIN AND MOBILITY ON PATIENTS WITH KOA, BUT THE EFFECTS ON QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) ARE UNCLEAR. BESIDES, MORE OUTCOME MEASURE RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH OF YOGA EFFECTS ON PEOPLE WITH KOA SHOULD BE CONDUCTED.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
7  317  39 AN INTEGRATED METHODOLOGY TO ASSESS COMPLIANCE WITH DELPHI SURVEY KEY COMPONENTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS AS APPLIED IN A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF FIBROMYALGIA STUDIES. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS ARTICLE WAS TO PRESENT A METHODOLOGY INCORPORATING EXISTING GUIDELINES AND TOOLS FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND TO EVALUATE THE DELPHI SURVEY 33 KEY COMPONENT RECOMMENDATIONS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS AS A TOOL FOR A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW IN FIBROMYALGIA STUDIES. DATA SOURCES: DATABASES SEARCHED INCLUDED PUBMED, OVID MEDLINE, PSYCHINFO, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, CINAHL, ALT HEALTHWATCH, PEDRO, AND WEB OF SCIENCE. ARTICLE SELECTION: SELECTED WERE ARTICLES PUBLISHED BETWEEN NOVEMBER 14, 2004 AND NOVEMBER 13, 2014, WRITTEN IN ENGLISH, REPORTING ORIGINAL RESEARCH OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR ADULTS WITH FIBROMYALGIA. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: SIX ARTICLES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA, REVEALING THAT THREE YOGA STYLES ("RELAXING" YOGA, YOGA OF AWARENESS, AND HATHA YOGA) HAVE BEEN ASSESSED IN PERSONS WITH FIBROMYALGIA. OVERALL, REPORTING COMPLIANCE WITH THE 33 KEY COMPONENTS RANGED FROM 39.4% TO 84.8%, WITH A MEAN ADHERENCE RATE OF 62.63% +/- 17.74. NONE OF THE AUTHORS USED AN ACCEPTED REPORTING GUIDELINE; SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OF ASANA, PRANAYAMA, RELAXATION, AND MINDFULNESS PRACTICES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE INTERVENTIONS TESTED WERE IDENTIFIED IN ONLY 33.33% OF THE ARTICLES REVIEWED; AND NONE OF THE ARTICLES INCLUDED DETAILED, REPLICABLE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE INTERVENTIONS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW SUPPORTS THE NEED FOR COMPREHENSIVE YOGA RESEARCH GUIDELINES. FINDINGS REVEAL A LACK OF REPORTING OF INTERVENTION DETAILS, THE NEED TO REPORT A DISEASE-SPECIFIC RATIONALE FOR SELECTION OF THE PARTICULAR YOGA STYLE USED FOR THE INTERVENTION, AND THAT A LIMITED NUMBER OF YOGA STYLES HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED IN PERSONS WITH FIBROMYALGIA.	2016	

8 2539  41 YOGA FOR ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF CONTROLLED TRIALS. A GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE SUGGESTS YOGIC PRACTICES MAY BENEFIT ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES (DM2). IN THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW, WE EVALUATE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE FROM PROSPECTIVE CONTROLLED TRIALS REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA-BASED PROGRAMS ON SPECIFIC HEALTH OUTCOMES PERTINENT TO DM2 MANAGEMENT. TO IDENTIFY QUALIFYING STUDIES, WE SEARCHED NINE DATABASES AND SCANNED BIBLIOGRAPHIES OF RELEVANT REVIEW PAPERS AND ALL IDENTIFIED ARTICLES. CONTROLLED TRIALS THAT DID NOT TARGET ADULTS WITH DIABETES, INCLUDED ONLY ADULTS WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES, WERE UNDER TWO-WEEK DURATION, OR DID NOT INCLUDE QUANTITATIVE OUTCOME DATA WERE EXCLUDED. STUDY QUALITY WAS EVALUATED USING THE PEDRO SCALE. THIRTY-THREE PAPERS REPORTING FINDINGS FROM 25 CONTROLLED TRIALS (13 NONRANDOMIZED, 12 RANDOMIZED) MET OUR INCLUSION CRITERIA (N = 2170 PARTICIPANTS). COLLECTIVELY, FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGIC PRACTICES MAY PROMOTE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN SEVERAL INDICES OF IMPORTANCE IN DM2 MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING GLYCEMIC CONTROL, LIPID LEVELS, AND BODY COMPOSITION. MORE LIMITED DATA SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY ALSO LOWER OXIDATIVE STRESS AND BLOOD PRESSURE; ENHANCE PULMONARY AND AUTONOMIC FUNCTION, MOOD, SLEEP, AND QUALITY OF LIFE; AND REDUCE MEDICATION USE IN ADULTS WITH DM2. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING STUDIES, ADDITIONAL HIGH-QUALITY INVESTIGATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO CONFIRM AND FURTHER ELUCIDATE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA PROGRAMS IN POPULATIONS WITH DM2.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
9 2199  36 THE EFFICACY OF TAI CHI AND YOGA IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND SPONDYLOARTHROPATHIES: A NARRATIVE BIOMEDICAL REVIEW. RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA) AND SPONDYLOARTHROPATHIES (SPA) ARE AMONG THE MOST COMMON INFLAMMATORY RHEUMATIC DISEASES, WHICH MIGHT INDUCE CHRONIC PAIN FOR THEIR SUFFERERS. MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS LIKE TAI CHI AND YOGA ARE AMONG THE MANY ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES FOR COMBATTING CHRONIC PAIN. THIS REVIEW AIMS TO OVERVIEW THE ARTICLES ABOUT THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN RA AND SPA. WE SEARCHED PUBMED/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, AND WEB OF SCIENCE FOR ENGLISH-LANGUAGE SOURCES FROM THEIR INCEPTION THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2017. CASE-CONTROL STUDIES, INTERVENTIONAL STUDIES, AND CASE SERIES THAT INCLUDED MORE THAN THREE CASES AND RANDOMIZED CROSSOVER STUDIES WERE INCLUDED. THE LITERATURE SEARCH RETRIEVED 133 NON-DUPLICATE RECORDS, AND 15 OF THEM WERE ELIGIBLE AND WERE INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW. THE INFLUENCE OF TAI CHI REMAINS DEBATABLE IN RA, WHILE THERE IS ONLY ONE STUDY THAT INVESTIGATED ITS EFFICACY IN SPA. YOGA SEEMS EFFECTIVE IN DECREASING PAIN AND INFLAMMATION WHILE INCREASING QUALITY OF LIFE. THERE ARE NO DATA AVAILABLE ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON SPA. EVEN AFTER A THOROUGH RESEARCH, THE NUMBER OF ARTICLES IS QUITE LIMITED ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TAI CHI AND YOGA IN RA AND SPA. WHILE THESE COMPLEMENTARY APPROACHES STILL SHOW SOME PROMISE AS ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES IN RA AND SPA, THE LITERATURE LACKS LONG-TERM STUDIES WITH LARGER PATIENT GROUPS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
10 2184  38 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW STUDY. INTRODUCTION: THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN MENOPAUSAL WOMEN IS CONSIDERED TO BE AN IMPORTANT HEALTH ISSUE IN DIFFERENT SOCIETIES AND ONE OF THE MAIN OBJECTIVES OF HEALTH CARE IN THIS PERIOD. THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN MENOPAUSAL WOMEN. METHOD: ENGLISH DATABASES OF GOOGLE SCHOLAR, SCIENCE DIRECT, PUBMED, SCOPUS, AND COCHRANE LIBRARY WERE SEARCHED TO ACCESS RELATED ARTICLES USING KEYWORDS OF MENOPAUSE, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND YOGA. FURTHERMORE, PERSIAN EQUIVALENTS OF THE SAME KEYWORDS WERE SEARCHED IN DATABASES OF GOOGLE SCHOLAR, SID, AND MAGIRAN, IN ADDITION TO A COMBINATION OF THE KEYWORDS. THE SEARCH INTERVAL WAS FROM THE INSPECTION TO JANUARY 2020. THE QUALITY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIED WAS ASSESSED BASED ON CONSORT 2017 CHECKLIST. RESULTS: OUT OF 120 ARTICLES FOUND IN THE DATABASES, SIX ARTICLES ENTERED THE STUDY BASED ON THE INCLUSION CRITERIA AND WERE INVESTIGATED FOR INTERVENTION METHODS AND CONSEQUENCES. THE RESULTS INDICATED THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF YOGA ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN MENOPAUSAL WOMEN. CONCLUSION: CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON THE SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN MENOPAUSAL WOMEN, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THIS LOW-COST METHOD BE USED TO IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE AND HEALTH.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
11  347  35 ASSESSING FIDELITY OF IMPLEMENTATION (FOI) FOR SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA INTERVENTIONS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. AS SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PROGRAMS GAIN POPULARITY, THE SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF FIDELITY OF PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION (FOI) IS CRITICAL TO PROVIDE A MORE ROBUST UNDERSTANDING OF THE CORE COMPONENTS OF MINDFULNESS AND YOGA INTERVENTIONS, THEIR POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE SPECIFIED TEACHER AND STUDENT OUTCOMES, AND OUR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT THESE PROGRAMS CONSISTENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY. THIS PAPER REVIEWS THE CURRENT STATE OF THE SCIENCE WITH RESPECT TO INCLUSION AND REPORTING OF FOI IN PEER-REVIEWED STUDIES EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND/OR YOGA PROGRAMS TARGETING STUDENTS AND/OR TEACHERS IMPLEMENTED IN GRADES KINDERGARTEN THROUGH TWELVE (K-12) IN NORTH AMERICA. ELECTRONIC SEARCHES IN PSYCHINFO AND WEB OF SCIENCE FROM THEIR INCEPTION THROUGH MAY 2014, IN ADDITION TO HAND SEARCHES OF RELEVANT REVIEW ARTICLES, IDENTIFIED 312 PUBLICATIONS, 48 OF WHICH MET INCLUSION CRITERIA. FINDINGS INDICATED A RELATIVE PAUCITY OF RIGOROUS FOI. FEWER THAN 10% OF STUDIES OUTLINED POTENTIAL CORE PROGRAM COMPONENTS OR REFERENCED A FORMAL THEORY OF ACTION, AND FEWER THAN 20% ASSESSED ANY ASPECT OF FOI BEYOND PARTICIPANT DOSAGE. THE EMERGING NATURE OF THE EVIDENCE BASE PROVIDES A CRITICAL WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY TO GRAPPLE WITH KEY ISSUES RELEVANT TO FOI OF MINDFULNESS-BASED AND YOGA PROGRAMS, INCLUDING IDENTIFYING ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT SHOULD BE FAITHFULLY IMPLEMENTED AND HOW WE MIGHT DEVELOP RIGOROUS MEASURES TO ACCURATELY CAPTURE THEM. CONSIDERATION OF THESE QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTED NEXT STEPS ARE INTENDED TO HELP ADVANCE THE EMERGING FIELD OF SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA INTERVENTIONS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                         
12 2061  44 THE BENEFITS OF YOGA IN CHILDREN. THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN SUFFERING FROM STRESS AND ANXIETY IN MALAYSIA IS ON THE RISE. EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT MIND-BODY THERAPIES SUCH AS MINDFULNESS THERAPY, MEDITATION AND YOGA HAVE BEEN PRACTICED IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES TO REDUCE AND/OR MANAGE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF STRESS AND ANXIETY. THIS REVIEW ARTICLE LOOKS AT THE INTERVENTION OF YOGA AS A MEDITATIVE MOVEMENT PRACTICE IN HELPING SCHOOL CHILDREN MANAGE STRESS AND ANXIETY. ARTICLES WERE RETRIEVED USING A COMBINATION OF DATABASES INCLUDING PUBMED/MEDLINE, AND PSYCINFO. NOT ONLY PEER-REVIEWED ARTICLES, BUT ALSO THOSE WRITTEN IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE WERE INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW. ALL STUDIES REVIEWED HAD INCORPORATED SOME FORM OF MEDITATIVE MOVEMENT EXERCISE. THE INTERVENTION ENCOMPASSED ASANAS (POSTURES), PRANAYAMA (EXPANSION OF LIFE FORCE), DHARANA (CONCENTRATION) AND DHYANA (MEDITATION), WHICH ARE THE DIFFERENT PATHS IN YOGA. A TOTAL OF EIGHT ARTICLES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA AND WERE REVIEWED. THE FINDINGS OF THIS REVIEW REVEAL THAT THE PRACTICE OF YOGA HAS BROUGHT ABOUT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, IMPROVEMENT IN MANAGING AND REDUCING STRESS AND ANXIETY. DESPITE THE LIMITATIONS IN MOST, IF NOT ALL OF THE STUDIES REVIEWED, IN TERMS OF HETEROGENEITY AND SAMPLE SIZE, YOGA APPEARS TO BE AN EFFECTIVE MODALITY FOR HELPING CHILDREN COPE WITH STRESS AND ANXIETY. IT APPEARS THAT IF SCHOOLS IN MALAYSIA CAN INCORPORATE YOGA AS PART OF THE PHYSICAL EDUCATION CURRICULUM, IT WILL DEFINITELY BENEFIT THE STUDENTS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
13  514  28 COMPARING AEROBIC EXERCISE WITH YOGA IN ANXIETY REDUCTION: AN INTEGRATIVE REVIEW. ANXIETY IS A COMMON MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER THAT AFFECTS MANY AMERICANS YET OFTEN GOES UNRECOGNIZED OR UNDERTREATED. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO REVIEW THE CURRENT LITERATURE TO ASSIST IN DETERMINING WHICH ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLIMENTARY THERAPY, AEROBIC EXERCISE OR YOGA, IS MOST BENEFICIAL IN REDUCING ANXIETY SYMPTOMS. THE LITERATURE SEARCH PROCESS RESULTED IN A TOTAL OF 14 ARTICLES INCLUDED IN THE REVIEW. RESULTS INDICATE THAT YOGA IS MORE EFFECTIVE IN DECREASING ANXIETY SYMPTOMS THAN AEROBIC EXERCISE. HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS CAN USE THIS INFORMATION TO HELP RECOMMEND AN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF THERAPY FOR PATIENTS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
14 1553  36 LITERATURE REVIEW OF RESEARCH ON CHRONIC PAIN AND YOGA IN MILITARY POPULATIONS. BACKGROUND: ALTHOUGH YOGA IS INCREASINGLY BEING PROVIDED TO ACTIVE DUTY SOLDIERS AND VETERANS, STUDIES WITH MILITARY POPULATIONS ARE LIMITED AND EFFECTS ON CHRONIC PAIN ARE LARGELY UNKNOWN. WE REVIEWED THE EXISTING BODY OF LITERATURE AND PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A LITERATURE REVIEW OF ELECTRONIC DATABASES (PUBMED, PSYCHINFO, WEB OF SCIENCE, SCIENCE CITATION INDEX EXPANDED, SOCIAL SCIENCES CITATION INDEX, CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS CITATION INDEX-SCIENCE, AND CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS CITATION INDEX-SOCIAL SCIENCE &AMP; HUMANITIES). THE STUDIES WERE REVIEWED FOR CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS MEAN AGE OF PARTICIPANTS, SAMPLE SIZE, YOGA TYPE, AND STUDY DESIGN. ONLY PEER-REVIEWED STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IN THE REVIEW. RESULTS: THE SEARCH YIELDED ONLY SIX STUDIES THAT EXAMINED PAIN AS AN OUTCOME OF YOGA FOR MILITARY POPULATIONS. WITH ONE EXCEPTION, STUDIES WERE WITH VETERAN POPULATIONS. ONLY ONE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED WITH OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM (OEF) OR OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM (OIF) VETERANS. ONE STUDY WAS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT). FOUR OF THE FIVE STUDIES REMAINING USED PRE/POST DESIGN, WHILE THE LAST STUDY USED A POST-ONLY DESIGN. CONCLUSIONS: STUDIES ON THE USE OF YOGA TO TREAT CHRONIC PAIN IN MILITARY POPULATIONS ARE IN THEIR INFANCY. METHODOLOGICAL WEAKNESSES INCLUDE SMALL SAMPLE SIZES, A LACK OF STUDIES WITH KEY GROUPS (ACTIVE DUTY, OEF/IEF VETERANS), AND USE OF SINGLE GROUP UNCONTROLLED DESIGNS (PRE/POST; POST ONLY) FOR ALL BUT ONE STUDY. FUTURE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO ADDRESS THESE METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS AND BUILD ON THIS SMALL BODY OF LITERATURE.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
15 2410  33 YOGA AND HYPERTENSION: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION IS A CORNERSTONE OF HYPERTENSION (HPT) TREATMENT, YET MOST RECOMMENDATIONS CURRENTLY FOCUS ON DIET AND EXERCISE AND DO NOT CONSIDER STRESS REDUCTION STRATEGIES. YOGA IS A SPIRITUAL PATH THAT MAY REDUCE BLOOD PRESSURE (BP) THROUGH REDUCING STRESS, INCREASING PARASYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION, AND ALTERING BARORECEPTOR SENSITIVITY; HOWEVER, DESPITE REVIEWS ON YOGA AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, DIABETES, METABOLIC SYNDROME, AND ANXIETY THAT SUGGEST YOGA MAY REDUCE BP, NO COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW HAS YET FOCUSED ON YOGA AND HPT. A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF ALL PUBLISHED STUDIES ON YOGA AND HPT WAS PERFORMED REVEALING 39 COHORT STUDIES, 30 NONRANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIALS (NRCTS), 48 RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS), AND 3 CASE REPORTS WITH DURATIONS RANGING FROM 1 WK TO 4 Y AND INVOLVING A TOTAL OF 6693 SUBJECTS. MOST STUDIES REPORTED THAT YOGA EFFECTIVELY REDUCED BP IN BOTH NORMOTENSIVE AND HYPERTENSIVE POPULATIONS. THESE STUDIES SUGGEST THAT YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE ADJUNCT THERAPY FOR HPT AND WORTHY OF INCLUSION IN CLINICAL GUIDELINES, YET THE GREAT HETEROGENEITY OF YOGA PRACTICES AND THE VARIABLE QUALITY OF THE RESEARCH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO RECOMMEND ANY SPECIFIC YOGA PRACTICE FOR HPT. FUTURE RESEARCH NEEDS TO FOCUS ON HIGH QUALITY CLINICAL TRIALS ALONG WITH STUDIES ON THE MECHANISMS OF ACTION OF DIFFERENT YOGA PRACTICES.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
16 1689  34 OVERVIEW OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS: YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION FOR ADULTS WITH ACUTE AND CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS. OBJECTIVES. OVERVIEW THE QUALITY, DIRECTION, AND CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR TREATMENT OF ACUTE AND CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS IN ADULT POPULATIONS. METHODS. WE SEARCHED FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS IN 10 ONLINE DATABASES, BIBLIOGRAPHIC REFERENCES, AND HAND-SEARCHES IN YOGA-RELATED JOURNALS. INCLUDED REVIEWS SATISFY OXMAN CRITERIA AND SPECIFY YOGA AS A PRIMARY INTERVENTION IN ONE OR MORE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS FOR TREATMENT IN ADULTS. THE AMSTAR TOOL AND GRADE APPROACH EVALUATED THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF REVIEWS AND QUALITY OF EVIDENCE. RESULTS. WE IDENTIFIED 2202 TITLES, OF WHICH 41 FULL-TEXT ARTICLES WERE ASSESSED FOR ELIGIBILITY AND 26 SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS SATISFIED INCLUSION CRITERIA. THIRTEEN SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS INCLUDE QUANTITATIVE DATA AND SIX PAPERS INCLUDE META-ANALYSIS. THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE IS GENERALLY LOW. SIXTEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF HEALTH CONDITIONS ARE INCLUDED. ELEVEN REVIEWS SHOW TENDENCY TOWARDS POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTION, 15 REVIEWS REPORT UNCLEAR RESULTS, AND NO, REVIEWS REPORT ADVERSE EFFECTS OF YOGA. YOGA APPEARS MOST EFFECTIVE FOR REDUCING SYMPTOMS IN ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND PAIN. CONCLUSION. ALTHOUGH THE QUALITY OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS IS HIGH, THE QUALITY OF SUPPORTING EVIDENCE IS LOW. SIGNIFICANT HETEROGENEITY AND VARIABILITY IN REPORTING INTERVENTIONS BY TYPE OF YOGA, SETTINGS, AND POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS LIMIT THE GENERALIZABILITY OF RESULTS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
17 2559  40 YOGA FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: A META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. OBJECTIVES: TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) USING A META-ANALYTICAL APPROACH. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) THAT EXAMINED PAIN ANDOR FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY AS TREATMENT OUTCOMES WERE INCLUDED. POST-TREATMENT AND FOLLOW-UP OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED. METHODS: A COMPREHENSIVE SEARCH OF RELEVANT ELECTRONIC DATABASES, FROM THE TIME OF THEIR INCEPTION UNTIL NOVEMBER 2011, WAS CONDUCTED. COHEN'S D EFFECT SIZES WERE CALCULATED AND ENTERED IN A RANDOM-EFFECTS MODEL. RESULTS: EIGHT RCTS MET THE CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION (EIGHT ASSESSING FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY AND FIVE ASSESSING PAIN) AND INVOLVED A TOTAL OF 743 PATIENTS. AT POST-TREATMENT, YOGA HAD A MEDIUM TO LARGE EFFECT ON FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY (D=0.645) AND PAIN (D=0.623). DESPITE A WIDE RANGE OF YOGA STYLES AND TREATMENT DURATIONS, HETEROGENEITY IN POST-TREATMENT EFFECT SIZES WAS LOW. FOLLOW-UP EFFECT SIZES FOR FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY AND PAIN WERE SMALLER, BUT REMAINED SIGNIFICANT (D=0.397 AND D=0.486, RESPECTIVELY); HOWEVER, THERE WAS A MODERATE TO HIGH LEVEL OF VARIABILITY IN THESE EFFECT SIZES. DISCUSSION: THE RESULTS OF THE PRESENT STUDY INDICATE THAT YOGA MAY BE AN EFFICACIOUS ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT FOR CLBP. THE STRONGEST AND MOST CONSISTENT EVIDENCE EMERGED FOR THE SHORT-TERM BENEFITS OF YOGA ON FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY. HOWEVER, BEFORE ANY DEFINITIVE CONCLUSIONS CAN BE DRAWN, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF METHODOLOGICAL CONCERNS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. IN PARTICULAR, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT FUTURE RCTS INCLUDE AN ACTIVE CONTROL GROUP TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOGA HAS SPECIFIC TREATMENT EFFECTS AND WHETHER YOGA OFFERS ANY ADVANTAGES OVER TRADITIONAL EXERCISE PROGRAMS AND OTHER ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES FOR CLBP.	2013	
                                                                                                                
18  646  43 DOES YOGA THERAPY REDUCE BLOOD PRESSURE IN PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION?: AN INTEGRATIVE REVIEW. THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE WAS TO PRESENT A EVIDENCE-BASED INTEGRATIVE RESEARCH REVIEW THAT VALIDATES YOGA THERAPY AS AN EFFECTIVE COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE (BP). THE ARTICLE ALSO USES THE THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK OF DR HANS SELYE'S GENERAL ADAPTATION SYNDROME. YOGA RESEARCHERS DEMONSTRATE THAT YOGA WORKS BECAUSE IT MODULATES THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SYSTEM OF THE BODY, SPECIFICALLY ITS EFFECT ON THE HEART RATE. THIS REVIEW IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE YOGA PRESENTS AN EFFECTIVE METHOD OF TREATING HYPERTENSION THAT IS NONPHARMACOLOGIC AND THEREFORE THERE ARE NO ADVERSE EFFECTS AND THERE ARE OTHER VALUABLE HEALTH BENEFITS. RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT STRESS IS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO HIGH BP; HENCE, THE USE OF THE GENERAL ADAPTATION SYNDROME AND THE MOST IMPORTANT ATTRIBUTE OF YOGA, THAT IS, IT IS A PHYSICAL AND MENTAL EXERCISE PROGRAM, THAT IS IN SYNC WITH THE PHILOSOPHY OF HOLISTIC NURSING CARE WHERE ONE TREATS THE WHOLE INDIVIDUAL AND NOT JUST THE DISEASE. THE REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED WITH A SEARCH OF COMPUTERIZED DATABASES SUCH AS OVID, ACADEMIC SEARCH PREMIER, CINAHL, MEDLINE, AND HEALTH SOURCE: NURSING/ACADEMIC EDITION, PSYCHINFO, AS WELL AS RELIABLE WEB SITES SUCH AS THE CDC.GOV, AMONG OTHERS. AN INTEGRATIVE REVIEW SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED, AND 10 STUDIES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. THEY INCLUDE A COMBINATION OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS, QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES, AND PILOT STUDIES. YOGA THERAPY IS A MULTIFUNCTIONAL EXERCISE MODALITY WITH NUMEROUS BENEFITS. NOT ONLY DOES YOGA REDUCE HIGH BP BUT IT HAS ALSO BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO EFFECTIVELY REDUCE BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL, CHOLESTEROL LEVEL, AND BODY WEIGHT, MAJOR PROBLEMS AFFECTING THE AMERICAN SOCIETY. THE COMPLETED INTEGRATIVE REVIEW PROVIDES GUIDELINES FOR NURSING IMPLEMENTATION AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT OF HIGH BP.	2012	
      
19 1084  32 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS MANAGEMENT IN HEALTHY ADULTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVE: THIS ARTICLE REPORTS A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON STRESS MANAGEMENT IN HEALTHY ADULTS. METHODS: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE SEARCH WAS PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) AND CLINICAL CONTROLLED TRIALS (CCTS) THAT ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS MANAGEMENT IN HEALTHY ADULTS. SELECTED STUDIES WERE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE TYPES OF INTERVENTION, DURATION, OUTCOME MEASURES, AND RESULTS. THEY WERE ALSO QUALITATIVELY ASSESSED BASED ON PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS. RESULTS: THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS BASED ON EIGHT RCTS AND CCTS THAT INDICATED A POSITIVE EFFECT OF YOGA IN REDUCING STRESS LEVELS OR STRESS SYMPTOMS. HOWEVER, MOST OF THE STUDIES HAD METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS IN THAT THE INTERVENTION DURATION WAS SHORT AND LIMITED FOLLOW-UP DATA WAS AVAILABLE. CONCLUSION: THIS REVIEW REVEALED POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS REDUCTION IN HEALTHY ADULT POPULATIONS. HOWEVER, THE RESULT SHOULD BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION DUE TO THE SMALL NUMBER OF STUDIES AND THE ASSOCIATED METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS. FURTHER STUDIES TO ASCERTAIN YOGA'S LONG-TERM EFFECTS AND THE UNDERLYING BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS LEADING TO ITS STRESS REDUCTION EFFECT SHOULD BE CONDUCTED.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
20 1083  40 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS AMONG HEALTHY ADULTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. BACKGROUND: YOGA WAS RECOMMENDED IN BOTH CLINICAL AND NONCLINICAL POPULATIONS AS THERAPY METHODS. THE DIVERSITY OF YOGA PRACTICE AS A THERAPY METHOD HAS RARELY BEEN DISCUSSED AND IT IS ESSENTIAL TO ADDRESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS. PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVE: THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF YOGA ON STRESS IN HEALTHY POPULATION. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE AUTHORS INTENDED TO FIGURE OUT YOGA EFFECTS ON STRESS SYSTEMATICALLY. METHODS/DESIGN: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY ARTICLES THAT ASSESS THE EFFECT OF YOGA AND YOGA-RELATED INTERVENTIONS ON STRESS REDUCTION IN NONCLINICAL POPULATIONS. STUDIES WERE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE LENGTH OF THE INTERVENTION, YOGA TYPE, AND MEASURES OF OUTCOME. THE STUDIES WERE SELECTED THROUGHOUT LAST 5 YEARS (JANUARY 2014 TO NOVEMBER 2018) BY USING THE KEY SEARCHING TERM YOGA AND STRESS INCORPORATION WITH TENSION AND PRESSURE. THE SELECTION PROCESS FOLLOWED THE PRISMA FLOW DIAGRAM. RESULTS: TOTALLY, 12 ARTICLES ELABORATING ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA OR YOGA-RELATED INTERVENTIONS ON STRESS MANAGEMENT AND REMISSION WERE INCLUDED IN THE REVIEW. THIS REVIEW INCLUDED VARIOUS TYPES OF YOGA PRACTICE (E.G., HATHA YOGA, BIKRAM YOGA, KUNDALINI YOGA, SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA, KRIPALU YOGA, YIN YOGA). A TIME SPECTRUM WAS CONDUCTED FROM 4 WKS TO 28 WKS. THIS REVIEW REVEALED THAT MOST TYPES OF YOGA HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON STRESS REDUCTION IN HEATHY POPULATIONS. CONCLUSION: FURTHER STUDIES ARE RECOMMENDED TO EXAMINE THE LONG-TERM EFFECT OF YOGA AND UNDERLYING PSYCHOLOGICAL MECHANISMS CAUSING STRESS AND MENTAL RESTRAIN. IN ADDITION, IT IS SUGGESTED TO CONSIDER AGE AS A RISK FACTOR AFFECTING THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON STRESS.	2020

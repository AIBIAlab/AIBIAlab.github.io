1  561 81 CREATING SPACE THROUGH AFRICA YOGA PROJECT: A QUALITATIVE STUDY. THIS QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS EXAMINED TEACHERS' EXPERIENCES OF THE AFRICA YOGA PROJECT (AYP), A MENTORING-ORIENTED YOGA PROGRAM FOR FOSTERING RESILIENCE AMONG INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS IMPACTED BY POVERTY AND TRAUMA. INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED WITH AYP TEACHERS WERE CODED USING QUALITATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS. THEMES DEMONSTRATED THAT AYP BENEFITED PARTICIPANTS BY CREATING S.P.A.C.E. (SAFETY AND STABILITY, PERSONAL GROWTH, ACTION, CULTURAL DIVERSITY, AND EMPOWERMENT). THE FINDINGS ILLUSTRATED WAYS IN WHICH THIS PROGRAM FOSTERED INDIVIDUAL AND COMMUNITY WELLNESS AND POSITIVE ENGAGEMENT. IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL FOR PROVIDING YOGA AS A LOW-COST, SUSTAINABLE, AND EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION TO PROMOTE HEALTH, ECONOMIC SELF-SUFFICIENCY, AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IN DIVERSE SETTINGS WITH LIMITED RESOURCES.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
2   10 29 "MAKING IT OKAY": PROFESSIONALS IN HIGH-STRESS ENVIRONMENTS CONSTRUCT THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT OF A YOGA-BASED RETREAT DESIGNED TO BUILD RESILIENCE. PURPOSE: WHILE THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE FOR RESILIENCE BUILDING PROGRAMMES, TO DATE RESEARCH HAS NOT EXPLORED HOW PROFESSIONALS CONSTRUCT UNDERSTANDING OF PROGRAMME IMPACT. RISE (RESILIENCE, INTEGRATION, SELF-AWARENESS, ENGAGEMENT), A 5-DAY YOGA-BASED RETREAT PROGRAMME, HAS BEEN LINKED WITH POSITIVE WELLNESS OUTCOMES. THIS QUALITATIVE INQUIRY EXPLORES PARTICIPANTS' REFLECTION AND EXPERIENCE 3 MONTHS AFTER PROGRAMME COMPLETION. METHODS: THROUGH A GROUNDED CONSTRUCTIVIST LENS, IN-DEPTH SEMI-STRUCTURED PHONE INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH 17 ADULT PROFESSIONALS IN HIGH-STRESS WORK ENVIRONMENTS WHO ATTENDED RISE. INITIAL HAND-CODING INFORMED CODEBOOK DEVELOPMENT FOR SYSTEMATIC CODING USING DIRECTED CONTENT ANALYSIS USING SENSITIZING STRUCTURING. RESULTS: TWO INTEGRATED PERCEPTIONS WOVEN THROUGH FIVE THEMES. PERSISTENT THREADS OF EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING AND SENSE OF PERMISSION PROVIDED STRUCTURE FOR THEMES FOUND. FIVE INTERRELATED THEMES RELATED TO PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH AND WORKPLACE DYNAMICS WERE (1) USE OF ACQUIRED BEHAVIOURAL SKILLS AND PRACTICES; (2) LIVED MINDFULNESS; (3) RESILIENCE TO STRESS AND EMOTION REGULATION (4) SELF-CARE AND SELF-COMPASSION, AND (5) SHARING WITH OTHERS. CONCLUSION: FINDINGS PROVIDE MEANINGFUL INTERPRETATION OF PREVIOUSLY REPORTED PROGRAMME EFFICACY BY CONTEXTUALIZING PERCEIVED BENEFITS WITHIN PARTICIPANTS' CONSTRUCTED UNDERSTANDING OF CHANGE. SPECIFICALLY, ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND EXPERIENTIAL CONSIDERATIONS HAVE SUGGESTED IMPLICATIONS FOR RESILIENCE BUILDING PROGRAMMES.ABBREVIATIONS: RISE (RESILIENCE, INTEGRATION, SELF-AWARENESS, ENGAGEMENT).	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
3 1155 28 ENHANCING YOGA PARTICIPATION: A QUALITATIVE INVESTIGATION OF BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO YOGA AMONG PREDOMINANTLY RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY, LOW-INCOME ADULTS. YOGA IS UNDERUTILIZED AMONG RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES AND LOW-INCOME POPULATIONS. TO ENHANCE PARTICIPATION AMONG THESE DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS AND TO INFORM A FUTURE CLINICAL TRIAL, WE CONDUCTED A QUALITATIVE FORMATIVE INVESTIGATION, INFORMED BY THE SOCIAL CONTEXTUAL MODEL OF HEALTH BEHAVIOR CHANGE, TO IDENTIFY BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO YOGA THAT COULD IMPACT STUDY PARTICIPATION. WE RECRUITED TWENTY-FOUR RACIALLY/ETHNICALLY DIVERSE ADULTS, WITH AND WITHOUT PRIOR YOGA EXPERIENCE, FROM A LOW-INCOME, URBAN HOUSING COMMUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN EITHER AN INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEW OR FOCUS GROUP. A THEMATIC DATA ANALYSIS APPROACH WAS EMPLOYED. BARRIERS TO YOGA ENGAGEMENT INCLUDED THE PERCEPTION THAT YOGA LACKS PHYSICALITY AND WEIGHT LOSS BENEFITS, FEAR OF INJURY, LACK OF ABILITY/SELF-EFFICACY TO PERFORM THE PRACTICES, PREFERENCE FOR OTHER PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES, AND SCHEDULING DIFFICULTIES. FACILITATORS OF YOGA ENGAGEMENT INCLUDED A QUALITY YOGA INSTRUCTOR WHO PROVIDES INDIVIDUALIZED INSTRUCTION, BEGINNER LEVEL CLASSES, AND PROMOTIONAL MESSAGING THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA, SUCH AS STRESS REDUCTION.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
4  148 24 A QUALITATIVE EXPLORATION OF IMPLEMENTATION FACTORS IN A SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PROGRAM: LESSONS LEARNED FROM STUDENTS AND TEACHERS. IDENTIFYING FACTORS RELEVANT FOR SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF SCHOOL-BASED INTERVENTIONS IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THAT PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED IN AN EFFECTIVE AND ENGAGING MANNER. THE PERSPECTIVES OF TWO KEY STAKEHOLDERS CRITICAL FOR IDENTIFYING IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS - STUDENTS AND THEIR CLASSROOM TEACHERS - MERIT ATTENTION IN THIS CONTEXT AND HAVE RARELY BEEN EXPLORED USING QUALITATIVE METHODS. THIS STUDY REPORTS QUALITATIVE PERSPECTIVES OF FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADE PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR TEACHERS OF A 16-WEEK SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PROGRAM IN THREE PUBLIC SCHOOLS SERVING LOW-INCOME URBAN COMMUNITIES. FOUR THEMES RELATED TO PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS EMERGED: PROGRAM DELIVERY FACTORS, PROGRAM BUY-IN, IMPLEMENTER COMMUNICATION WITH TEACHERS, AND INSTRUCTOR QUALITIES. FEEDBACK FROM STUDENTS AND TEACHERS IS DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT OF INFORMING IMPLEMENTATION, ADAPTATION, AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PROGRAMMING IN URBAN SETTINGS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
5  151 30 A QUALITATIVE INVESTIGATION TO INFORM YOGA INTERVENTION RECRUITMENT PRACTICES FOR RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY ADOLESCENTS IN OUTPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. OBJECTIVE: YOGA IS RECOGNIZED AS AN EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO IMPROVING OVERALL PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH; HOWEVER, THERE MAY BE PERCEIVED BARRIERS TO YOGA PARTICIPATION, PARTICULARLY AMONG POPULATIONS MOST AT RISK FOR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. WE CONDUCTED QUALITATIVE FORMATIVE RESEARCH TO HELP INFORM RECRUITMENT PRACTICES FOR A FUTURE STUDY AND TO SPECIFICALLY UNDERSTAND THE BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO ENGAGEMENT IN YOGA PRACTICE AMONG RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY ADOLESCENTS, AS WELL AS ADOLESCENTS IN OUTPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. METHODS: QUALITATIVE DATA WERE COLLECTED AT A COMMUNITY HEALTH CLINIC THAT SERVES LOW INCOME FAMILIES IN SOUTHEASTERN FLORIDA. USING SEMI STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY ADOLESCENTS BETWEEN 12 AND 17 YEARS OLD, PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED ABOUT BELIEFS AND PERCEPTIONS ABOUT YOGA, AS WELL AS RECOMMENDATIONS ON RECRUITING PEERS. A THEMATIC ANALYSIS APPROACH WAS USED TO IDENTIFY AND EXAMINE COMMON THEMES. RESULTS: TWENTY INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED AND EIGHT MAJOR THEMES EMERGED FROM THE DATA. THEMES WERE GROUPED AS (1) FACILITATORS TO RECRUITMENT AND (2) BARRIERS TO RECRUITMENT. INTERPRETATION: ADVERTISING FREE YOGA THAT EMPHASIZES THE SOCIAL, PHYSICAL, AND MENTAL BENEFITS CAN HELP ASSUAGE NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OF YOGA AND PROMOTE THE ADVANTAGES OF YOGA AMONG TEENAGERS. HAVING RECRUITMENT MATERIALS AND MODALITIES THAT HIGHLIGHT INCLUSIVITY OF ALL GENDERS AND PHYSICAL ABILITIES IN THE YOGA CLASSES ARE ALSO IMPORTANT IN FACILITATING PARTICIPATION. UNDERSTANDING PERCEPTIONS OF YOGA, AS WELL AS PERCEIVED BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS, AMONG RACIALLY/ETHNICALLY DIVERSE ADOLESCENTS IN OUTPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT, CAN ASSIST RECRUITMENT EFFORTS, INCREASE YOGA INTERVENTION PARTICIPATION, AND ULTIMATELY, IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
6 2517 19 YOGA COMMUNITIES AND EATING DISORDERS: CREATING SAFE SPACE FOR POSITIVE EMBODIMENT. WITH ADEQUATE EDUCATION AND GUIDANCE, YOGA COMMUNITIES, AS PART OF THE THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPE IN THE 21ST CENTURY, CAN PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE PROMOTING POSITIVE EMBODIMENT FOR THOSE WITH, AND AT-RISK FOR, EATING DISORDERS (EDS). TO DO THIS, YOGA TEACHERS NEED TO KNOW HOW TO CREATE A BODY-POSITIVE COMMUNITY AND BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE AND RESPOND TO THOSE AT RISK AND STRUGGLING WITH EDS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS YOGA TEACHING METHODS ASSOCIATED WITH EDS AND ED RISK, BROADER CONCEPTUAL APPROACHES AND SPECIFIC PRACTICES ASSOCIATED WITH POSITIVE EMBODIMENT ARE OFFERED. THESE INCLUDE THE BROADER CONCEPTUAL APPROACHES OF: INTENTIONAL INCLUSION AND ACCEPTANCE, EXPERIENTIAL EMPHASIS, SUPPORTING POSITIVE EMBODIMENT AND INQUIRY. STUDIO PRAGMATICS ARE ALSO DETAILED AS RELATED TO THE BODY, BREATH, EMOTIONS, AND COMMUNITY.

8 2520 31 YOGA COMPLEMENTS COGNITIVE BEHAVIOUR THERAPY AS AN ADJUNCT TREATMENT FOR ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION: QUALITATIVE FINDINGS FROM A MIXED-METHODS STUDY. OBJECTIVES: COGNITIVE BEHAVIOUR THERAPY (CBT) IS RECOMMENDED FOR TREATING ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, DEMONSTRATING GOOD EFFICACY AND MODERATE RATES OF ENGAGEMENT. TO FURTHER IMPROVE OUTCOMES AND ACCESS TO EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENTS, RESEARCHERS HAVE SOUGHT TO ENHANCE CBT PROTOCOLS WITH MINDFULNESS-BASED APPROACHES, SUCH AS YOGA. THIS STUDY AIMED TO EXAMINE WHETHER YOGA IS AN ACCEPTABLE AND COMPLEMENTARY ADJUNCT TO CBT THROUGH EXPLORING THE LIVED EXPERIENCES OF ADULTS WITH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION WHO ENGAGED IN AN ADJUNCT THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAMME ALONGSIDE GROUP CBT. DESIGN: SINGLE-GROUP QUALITATIVE DESIGN WITH POST-INTERVENTION AND FOLLOW-UP TIMEPOINTS. METHODS: THIRTY-SIX ADULTS WITH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SELF-SELECTED INTO A THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAMME AS AN ADJUNCT TO GROUP CBT. QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH 27 PARTICIPANTS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE EIGHT-WEEK PROGRAMME AND AGAIN THREE MONTHS LATER. THEMATIC ANALYSIS WAS USED TO IDENTIFY COMMON THEMES FROM THE LIVED EXPERIENCES. RESULTS: THREE PRIMARY THEMES, WITH NINE SUBTHEMES, WERE IDENTIFIED WHICH REFLECT THE EXPERIENCES OF THE COMBINED THERAPIES, THE COMPLEMENTARY ELEMENTS, AND PROCESS OF ENGAGEMENT OVER TIME. THE ADJUNCT YOGA PROGRAMME WAS HIGHLY ACCEPTABLE TO ADULTS WITH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, ENHANCING ENGAGEMENT AND PERCEIVED OUTCOMES. YOGA WAS IDENTIFIED AS PROVIDING A UNIQUE COMBINATION OF ELEMENTS THAT COMPLEMENTED PROCESSES OF CBT, SUCH AS BEHAVIOURAL ACTIVATION AND THOUGHT DISPUTATION. YOGA PRACTICES REPRESENTED MENTAL HEALTH SELF-MANAGEMENT TOOLS THAT ARE ACCESSIBLE AND AVAILABLE AS RELAPSE PREVENTION STRATEGIES. CONCLUSIONS: THERAPEUTIC YOGA WARRANTS CONSIDERATION AS AN ADJUNCT TREATMENT FOR ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AS IT OFFERS UNIQUE AND COMPLEMENTARY ELEMENTS TO CBT AND CAN ENHANCE ENGAGEMENT AND PERCEIVED CLINICAL OUTCOMES. PRACTITIONER POINTS: ADULTS WITH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION EXPERIENCED A THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAMME AS A SUITABLE AND APPEALING ADJUNCT THAT ENHANCED ENGAGEMENT WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENT. YOGA OFFERS A UNIQUE COMBINATION OF ELEMENTS, INCLUDING A VALUES SYSTEM, BODY-BASED MINDFULNESS PRACTICES, AND BREATHING TECHNIQUES, THAT COMPLEMENT CBT PROCESSES, SUCH AS BEHAVIOURAL ACTIVATION, AWARENESS OF MALADAPTIVE PATTERNS, AND THOUGHT DISPUTATION. A THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAMME PROVIDES ADULTS WITH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION WITH AN ACCESSIBLE AND SUSTAINABLE MENTAL HEALTH SELF-MANAGEMENT TOOL. THERAPEUTIC YOGA CAN BE CONSIDERED FOR INTEGRATION TO MODELS OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE PROVISION TO ENHANCE ENGAGEMENT AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES FOR ADULTS WITH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION.	2021

FOCUSING ON COMMUNITY-CLINICAL PARTNERSHIPS, UTILIZING A CLASS STRUCTURE WITH VOLUNTEERS, AND FOSTERING AN ONGOING INCLUSIVE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT ARE POTENTIAL STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS IN OTHER COMMUNITY PROGRAMS FOR THOSE WITH DISABILITY.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
11   11 28 "MAYBE BLACK GIRLS DO YOGA": A FOCUS GROUP STUDY WITH PREDOMINANTLY LOW-INCOME AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN. OBJECTIVE: TO EXPLORE AFRICAN AMERICAN (AA) WOMEN'S USE OF MIND-BODY THERAPIES, SUCH AS YOGA AND MINDFULNESS, AND FACTORS THAT IMPACT THEIR EXPERIENCES, OBSERVATIONS AND OPINIONS. DESIGN: FOCUS GROUPS WERE CONDUCTED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW AA WOMEN PERCEIVE MIND-BODY THERAPIES AND HOW TO BEST BRING THESE INTERVENTIONS INTO THEIR COMMUNITY. INTERVIEWS WERE AUDIOTAPED AND TRANSCRIBED. SETTING: THE URBAN MIDWEST. OUTCOME MEASURES: IN ADDITION TO QUALITATIVE OUTCOMES, DESCRIPTIVE MEASURES INCLUDED THE PERCEIVED STRESSOR SCALE, BELIEFS ABOUT YOGA SCALE, AND DETERMINANTS OF MEDITATION PRACTICE INVENTORY (DOMPI). RESULTS: TWENTY-TWO, PREDOMINANTLY LOW-INCOME (75% REPORTED INCOME <$50,000) AND SINGLE (82%) WOMEN PARTICIPATED IN THREE AGE STRATIFIED FOCUS GROUPS (18-34 YEARS, 35-65 YEARS, 66 YEARS AND OLDER). PARTICIPANTS ACKNOWLEDGED LIFE STRESS AND SHARED COMMON COPING MECHANISMS. THEY RECOGNIZED THAT YOGA AND MINDFULNESS COULD BE BENEFICIAL AND DISCUSSED BARRIERS TO PRACTICE (INCLUDING PERSONAL AND STRUCTURAL). YOUNGER WOMEN REPORTED MORE TIME CONSTRAINTS AS BARRIERS, MIDDLE AGED WOMEN HAD MORE EXPERIENCE WITH YOGA, AND OLDER WOMEN IDENTIFIED THE SPIRITUAL COMPONENT TO YOGA/MINDFULNESS AS POTENTIALLY CONFLICTING WITH CURRENT COPING STRATEGIES. PARTICIPANTS SUGGESTED WAYS TO SHARE MIND-BODY THERAPIES WITHIN THE AA COMMUNITY ALONG WITH SOLUTIONS FOR ENGAGEMENT. CONCLUSIONS: AA WOMEN ACKNOWLEDGED STRESS IN THEIR LIVES AND RECOGNIZED THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL COPING MEASURES. ALTHOUGH WOMEN REPORTED INTEREST IN YOGA/MINDFULNESS THEY IDENTIFIED BARRIERS, INCLUDING LIMITED ACCESS TO CONVENIENT CLASSES, AND OFFERED SUGGESTIONS FOR BRINGING YOGA AND MINDFULNESS TO THEIR COMMUNITIES.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
12  156 30 A QUALITATIVE STUDY OF LOVEYOURBRAIN YOGA: A GROUP-BASED YOGA WITH PSYCHOEDUCATION INTERVENTION TO FACILITATE COMMUNITY INTEGRATION FOR PEOPLE WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. PURPOSE: TO EXPLORE PARTICIPANTS' EXPERIENCES IN A GROUP-BASED YOGA WITH PSYCHOEDUCATION INTERVENTION DESIGNED TO FACILITATE COMMUNITY INTEGRATION FOR PEOPLE WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS.MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE CONDUCTED SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH 13 PEOPLE WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND THREE CAREGIVERS WHO HAD COMPLETED LOVEYOURBRAIN YOGA, A 6-SESSION, MANUALIZED, GROUP-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION THAT INCORPORATES BREATHING EXERCISES, YOGA, MEDITATION, AND PSYCHOEDUCATION. INTERVIEWS WERE ANALYZED USING CONTENT ANALYSIS.RESULTS: WE IDENTIFIED SEVEN THEMES: EASE OF PARTICIPATION, BELONGING, SUSTAINING COMMUNITY CONNECTION, PHYSICAL HEALTH, SELF-REGULATION, SELF-EFFICACY, AND RESILIENCE. ALL PARTICIPANTS VALUED THE COMMUNITY-BASED YOGA STUDIO ENVIRONMENT AND MULTIFACETED STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM. PARTICIPANTS REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN STRENGTH, BALANCE, FLEXIBILITY, AND ATTENTION CONTROL, AND A GREATER SENSE OF BELONGING, COMMUNITY CONNECTION, AND ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR LIVES. PARTICIPANTS REPORTED ONGOING USE OF TOOLS (E.G., BREATHING EXERCISES) TO COPE WITH NEGATIVE EMOTIONS AND STRESS. ABOUT HALF OF PARTICIPANTS SUSTAINED RELATIONSHIPS BUILT DURING LOVEYOURBRAIN YOGA AND FELT MORE CAPABLE OF ACCESSING OTHER ACTIVITIES IN THEIR COMMUNITY.CONCLUSIONS: LOVEYOURBRAIN YOGA SUCCESSFULLY PROMOTED COMMUNITY INTEGRATION FOR PEOPLE WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY. IT ALSO FACILITATED DIVERSE AND MEANINGFUL PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND SOCIAL HEALTH BENEFITS, WHICH SUGGEST THAT IT MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE MODE OF COMMUNITY-BASED REHABILITATION.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONTRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY SURVIVORS OFTEN STRUGGLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR COMMUNITY, THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF REHABILITATIONYOGA IS A HOLISTIC THERAPY WITH MANY BENEFITS, YET IS NOT ACCESSIBLE TO THE TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY POPULATION AT THE COMMUNITY LEVELPARTICIPANTS IN A COMMUNITY-BASED YOGA WITH PSYCHOEDUCATION INTERVENTION IN SIX STATES EXPERIENCED DIVERSE AND MEANINGFUL PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND SOCIAL HEALTH BENEFITSGROUP-BASED YOGA WITH PSYCHOEDUCATION MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE MODE OF COMMUNITY INTEGRATION AND COMMUNITY-BASED REHABILITATION FOR TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY SURVIVORS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
13  474 22 CLAIMING PEACEFUL EMBODIMENT THROUGH YOGA IN THE AFTERMATH OF TRAUMA. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DESCRIBE THE EXPERIENCES OF PRACTICING YOGA AND ITS ROLE WITHIN PROCESSES OF HEALING FOR ADULT WOMEN WITH COMPLEX TRAUMA HISTORIES. USING A HERMENEUTIC PHENOMENOLOGICAL METHOD, DATA WERE ANALYZED FROM INTERVIEWS WITH 39 WOMEN. RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE CORE MEANING OF PARTICIPANTS' EXPERIENCE OF HEALING THROUGH YOGA IS CLAIMING PEACEFUL EMBODIMENT. THIS IS AN ONGOING PROCESS OCCURRING ON A CONTINUUM WHEREBY WOMEN EXPERIENCED IMPROVED CONNECTIONS WITH AND SENSE OF OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OVER THEIR BODIES, EMOTIONS AND THOUGHTS, AND A GREATER SENSE OF WELL-BEING, CALMNESS, AND WHOLENESS IN THEIR BODIES AND MINDS. A NUMBER OF INTERCONNECTED ESSENTIAL THEMES RELATED TO THIS CORE MEANING WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED, ILLUMINATING PROCESSES THAT SUPPORTED CLAIMING PEACEFUL EMBODIMENT AND CAPABILITIES THAT WERE ENABLED BY BEING MORE PEACEFULLY EMBODIED. ADDITIONAL THEMES WERE IDENTIFIED HIGHLIGHTING FACTORS THAT FACILITATED OR IMPEDED PARTICIPANTS' ENGAGEMENT WITH YOGA AND THEIR EXPERIENCES OF HEALING THROUGH YOGA.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
14 1342 25 HOW YOGA HELPS HEAL INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA: PERSPECTIVES AND THEMES FROM 11 INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA SURVIVORS. TRAUMA IS UBIQUITOUS IN OUR SOCIETY; THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO EXPLORE HOW INDIVIDUALS CULTIVATE HEALING AFTER TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES. YOGA MAY BE ONE AVENUE TO CULTIVATE HEALING. QUALITATIVE METHODS WERE EMPLOYED TO STUDY THE ROLE YOGA PRACTICE PLAYED IN THE HEALING PROCESS OF THOSE WHO EXPERIENCED INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA. ELEVEN INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA SURVIVORS WHO PRACTICED YOGA REGULARLY WERE IDENTIFIED THROUGH A CRITERION SAMPLING METHOD. DATA ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE EMPHASIS OF YOGA ON MIND AND PHYSICAL BODY FOSTERED NUMEROUS POSITIVE OUTCOMES, SUCH AS SPIRITUAL GROWTH, SELF-ACCEPTANCE, ALLEVIATION OF TRAUMA-RELATED SYMPTOMS, AND INCREASED FEELINGS OF SELF-COMPASSION, EMPOWERMENT, AND SERENITY. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY BE HELPFUL TO REGAIN MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH, FOSTER WELLBEING, AND CULTIVATE PERSONAL GROWTH AFTER INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA.	2016

THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A CULTURALLY TAILORED VERSION OF A TC-TSY INTERVENTION DELIVERED AS A DROP-IN SERVICE IN A PUBLIC HOSPITAL-BASED CLINIC TO PATIENTS WITH HISTORIES OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE AND SUICIDE ATTEMPTS. TC-TSY WAS ITERATIVELY TAILORED TO MEET THE UNIQUE CLINICAL NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THIS SETTING. GROUP FACILITATOR OBSERVATIONS ARE SUMMARIZED; THEY DESCRIBE A SUCCESSFUL INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION AND CULTURALLY INFORMED ADAPTATION OF THE GROUP INTERVENTION. THE FACILITATORS' OBSERVATIONS ILLUSTRATED THAT GROUP MEMBERS ACCEPTED THE INTEGRATION OF THIS STRUCTURED, GENTLE YOGA PRACTICE INTO OUTPATIENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAMMING AND IDENTIFIED SITE-SPECIFIC MODIFICATIONS TO INFORM FORMAL STUDY. THE PROCESS BY WHICH TC-TSY WAS ADAPTED AND IMPLEMENTED FOR BLACK INDIVIDUALS WITH A HISTORY OF INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA AT RISK FOR SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR CAN SERVE AS A GUIDE FOR TAILORING OTHER COMPLEMENTARY, INTEGRATIVE INTERVENTIONS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF UNIQUE CLINICAL SETTINGS. THIS PROCESS IS OFFERED AS A FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE SYSTEMATIC TESTING OF THIS COMPLEMENTARY, INTEGRATED, CULTURALLY ADAPTED TRAUMA THERAPY IN HIGH-RISK CLINICAL POPULATIONS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
16   17 33 "THE PAIN LEFT, I WAS OFF AND RUNNING": A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF GROUP ACUPUNCTURE AND YOGA THERAPY FOR CHRONIC PAIN IN A LOW-INCOME AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE POPULATION. INTRODUCTION: CHRONIC PAIN AND THE CURRENT OPIOID EPIDEMIC ARE PRESSING PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS, ESPECIALLY IN LOW-INCOME AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE COMMUNITIES. NONPHARMACOLOGIC THERAPIES THAT ARE SAFE, EFFECTIVE, AND ACCEPTABLE FOR THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC PAIN CONDITIONS MAY PROVIDE A SOLUTION FOR ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE. THIS QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS EXPLORES THE EXPERIENCE OF STUDY PARTICIPANTS WHO RECEIVED COMBINED ACUPUNCTURE AND YOGA THERAPY (YT) TO TREAT CHRONIC PAIN DELIVERED IN A PRIMARY CARE SETTING. METHODS: THE GROUP ACUPUNCTURE WITH YOGA THERAPY FOR CHRONIC NECK, LOW BACK, AND OSTEOARTHRITIC PAIN TRIAL (GAPYOGA) ASSESSED THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF GROUP ACUPUNCTURE (GA) COMBINED WITH YT IN A LOW-INCOME, RACIAL, AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE POPULATION. INDIVIDUAL IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH A SUBSET OF PATIENTS IN THE TRIAL. NINETEEN PARTICIPANTS WERE INTERVIEWED FOR QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THEIR EXPERIENCE. USING THE IMMERSION AND CRYSTALLIZATION METHOD, TRANSCRIBED INTERVIEWS WERE ANALYZED FOR THEMES MEANINGFULLY REPRESENTING PARTICIPANT EXPERIENCE. RESULTS: THE COMBINED GA AND YT RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT PAIN RELIEF AND TRANSFORMATIVE HEALING EXPERIENCES. THREE THEMES EMERGED FROM PARTICIPANT NARRATIVES: (1) TRANSFORMATIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH SELF IN THE HEALING PROCESS THROUGH PAIN RELIEF, PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING, AND SELF-EFFICACY; (2) THERAPEUTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH ACUPUNCTURE AND YOGA PROVIDERS; AND (3) FOSTERING RELATIONSHIPS WITH FELLOW PARTICIPANTS IN THE GROUP. DISCUSSION: IN THIS STUDY OF A LOW-INCOME AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE POPULATION, THE COMBINATION OF ACUPUNCTURE AND YT WAS FOUND TO ALLEVIATE PAIN, IMPROVE FUNCTION, PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING, AND ENGAGE PARTICIPANTS IN SELF-CARE PRACTICES IN A TRANSFORMATIVE HEALING PROCESS-RESULTING IN PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFITS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
17 1211 20 EXPLORING HOW DIFFERENT TYPES OF YOGA CHANGE PSYCHOLOGICAL RESOURCES AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING ACROSS A SINGLE SESSION. OBJECTIVES: YOGA DEMONSTRATES BENEFICIAL EFFECTS IN MANY POPULATIONS, YET OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW YOGA BRINGS ABOUT THESE EFFECTS IS QUITE LIMITED. AMONG THE PROPOSED MECHANISMS OF YOGA ARE INCREASING PSYCHOLOGICAL RESOURCES (MINDFULNESS, BODY CONSCIOUSNESS, SELF-TRANSCENDENCE, SPIRITUAL PEACE, AND SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS) THAT MAY BRING ABOUT SALUTARY EFFECTS ON EMOTIONAL WELLBEING. FURTHER, YOGA IS A COMPLEX PRACTICE COMPRISING MEDITATION, ACTIVE AND RESTORATIVE POSTURES, AND BREATHWORK; HOWEVER LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW DIFFERENT COMPONENTS MAY AFFECT MECHANISMS. WE AIMED TO DETERMINE HOW AN ACUTE SESSION OF YOGA (AND ITS SPECIFIC COMPONENTS) RELATED TO PRE- TO POST- SESSION CHANGES IN PROPOSED MECHANISMS (PSYCHOLOGICAL RESOURCES) AND WHETHER THOSE CHANGES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH POSITIVE CHANGES IN EMOTIONS. DESIGN: 144 REGULAR YOGA PRACTITIONERS COMPLETED MEASURES OF MINDFULNESS, BODY CONSCIOUSNESS, SELF-TRANSCENDENCE, SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS, SPIRITUAL PEACE, AND EXERCISE-INDUCED EMOTIONS (POSITIVE ENGAGEMENT, REVITALIZATION, TRANQUILITY, EXHAUSTION) IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND AFTER A YOGA SESSION (N=11 SESSIONS, EACH A DIFFERENT TYPE OF YOGA). PERCEIVED PROPERTIES OF EACH YOGA SESSION, EXERCISE EXERTION AND ENGAGEMENT WITH THE YOGA TEACHER WERE ASSESSED IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE SESSION. RESULTS: PRE-TO POST- YOGA, LEVELS OF POSITIVE EMOTIONS (ENGAGEMENT, TRANQUILITY AND REVITALIZATION) INCREASED WHILE EXHAUSTION DECREASED. FURTHER, ALL PSYCHOLOGICAL RESOURCES INCREASED AND CLOSELY TRACKED IMPROVED EMOTIONS. ADDITIONALLY, ASPECTS OF THE YOGA SESSION CORRELATED WITH CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL RESOURCES (MECHANISMS) AND EMOTIONS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA MAY INFLUENCE MULTIPLE PSYCHOLOGICAL MECHANISMS THAT INFLUENCE EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING. FURTHER, DIFFERENT TYPES OF YOGA MAY AFFECT DIFFERENT MECHANISMS. RESULTS CAN INFORM YOGA INTERVENTIONS AIMING TO OPTIMIZE EFFECTS THROUGH SPECIFIC MECHANISMS SUCH AS MINDFULNESS OR SPIRITUALITY.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
18 1343 30 HOW YOGA IMPACTS THE SUBSTANCE USE OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV WHO ARE IN REENTRY FROM PRISON OR JAIL: A QUALITATIVE STUDY. OBJECTIVES: NASCENT RESEARCH REFLECTS THE PROMISE OF YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR SUBSTANCE USE. WHILE PUTATIVE MECHANISMS BEHIND YOGA'S IMPACT ON SUBSTANCE USE HAVE BEEN PROPOSED, THE RESEARCH IS LIMITED. THIS MANUSCRIPT AIMS TO DETERMINE HOW A HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION IMPACTS THE SUBSTANCE USE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN REENTRY FROM PRISON OR JAIL (RETURNING CITIZENS), AND LIVING WITH HIV AND SUBSTANCE USE PROBLEMS. DESIGN: SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH 28 RETURNING CITIZENS WHO PARTICIPATED IN A YOGA INTERVENTION. GUIDED BY A QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTIVE METHODOLOGY, THEMATIC ANALYSIS WAS USED TO IDENTIFY THEMES THAT ANSWERED HOW YOGA IMPACTED PARTICIPANT SUBSTANCE USE. SETTING: A COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN PHILADELPHIA, PA, USA THAT CONNECTS PEOPLE TO HEALTH SERVICES, PROVIDES EDUCATION AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES, AND ADVOCATES FOR PEOPLE WITH CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT. INTERVENTION: A 90-MINUTE HATHA YOGA CLASS OFFERED ONCE A WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS. RESULTS: FOURTEEN PARTICIPANTS REPORTED THAT YOGA EITHER REDUCED SUBSTANCE USE OR MAINTAINED NON-USE, VIA THE MECHANISMS OF PURPOSEFUL DISTRACTION, STRESS COPING (BY CULTIVATING MINDFULNESS AND REDUCING PHYSICAL DISCOMFORT), SOCIAL SUPPORT AND CONFIDENCE. ELEVEN PARTICIPANTS REPORTED THAT YOGA DID NOT IMPACT THEIR SUBSTANCE USE. THREE PARTICIPANTS DID NOT DISCUSS IT. CONCLUSIONS: BY PROVIDING PURPOSEFUL DISTRACTION, INCREASED STRESS COPING, SOCIAL SUPPORT AND CONFIDENCE; YOGA MAY REDUCE SUBSTANCE USE AND MAINTAIN ENGAGEMENT IN RECOVERY. THESE MECHANISTIC ACTIONS PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR THEMES TO HIGHLIGHT IN YOGA CLASSES THAT AIM TO IMPACT SUBSTANCE USE AMONG RETURNING CITIZENS LIVING WITH HIV.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
19  155 28 A QUALITATIVE STUDY EXPLORING YOGA IN VETERANS WITH PTSD SYMPTOMS. QUANTITATIVE STUDIES OF YOGA HAVE REPORTED REDUCED POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) SYMPTOMS IN VETERANS, BUT LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW AND WHY VETERANS ARE ATTRACTED TO AND STICK WITH A YOGA PRACTICE. GUIDED BY THE HEALTH BELIEF MODEL, THIS STUDY EXAMINED VETERANS' PERCEPTIONS OF THE BENEFITS, BARRIERS, AND MOTIVATIONS TO CONTINUE PRACTICING TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA. INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH NINE INDIVIDUALS, FIVE OF WHOM COMPLETED A 6-WEEK TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA INTERVENTION DESIGNED FOR VETERANS AND FOUR WHO DID NOT COMPLETE THE INTERVENTION. TRANSCRIPTS WERE ANALYZED FOR THEMES. THE BENEFITS IDENTIFIED BY VETERANS WERE FINDING MENTAL STILLNESS, BODY AWARENESS, AND SOCIAL CONNECTION. THE BARRIERS WERE PERCEPTIONS THAT YOGA IS SOCIALLY UNACCEPTABLE, ESPECIALLY FOR MEN, AND PHYSICALLY UNCHALLENGING. UNDERSTANDING THESE BENEFITS AND BARRIERS CAN HELP TO MAKE YOGA MORE ATTRACTIVE TO SERVICE MEMBERS AND VETERANS. FOR EXAMPLE, MEDICAL PERSONNEL CAN REFER SERVICE MEMBERS AND VETERANS TO YOGA NOT ONLY FOR PTSD SYMPTOMS, BUT ALSO TO ADDRESS BACK PAIN AND TO REDUCE ISOLATION. ACCESS TO MALE YOGA INSTRUCTORS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE THEMSELVES SERVICE MEMBERS OR VETERANS, COULD BE EXPANDED, AND CLASSES COULD BE INTEGRATED INTO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ROUTINES REQUIRED OF ACTIVE-DUTY PERSONNEL. PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS CAN FEATURE MALE SERVICE MEMBERS AND VETERANS WITH CAPTIONS RELATED TO YOGA AS A WAY TO INCREASE RESILIENCY, SELF-SUFFICIENCY, AND PHYSICAL AND MENTAL MISSION READINESS. FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY CAN HELP THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND THE VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION IMPLEMENT YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT OR ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT FOR VETERANS WITH PTSD SYMPTOMS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
20 2372 28 WHAT HELPS OLDER PEOPLE PERSEVERE WITH YOGA CLASSES? A REALIST PROCESS EVALUATION OF A COVID-19-AFFECTED YOGA PROGRAM FOR FALL PREVENTION. BACKGROUND: FALLS AMONG OLDER PEOPLE ARE A MAJOR GLOBAL HEALTH CONCERN. THIS PROCESS EVALUATION INVESTIGATES THE EXPERIENCE OF PARTICIPANTS AGED 60+ IN A YOGA PROGRAM AIMED AT PREVENTING FALLS WHICH TRANSITIONED FROM STUDIO-BASED CLASSES TO ONLINE CLASSES IN RESPONSE TO COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS. WE SOUGHT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE SUCCESSFUL AGEING (SAGE) YOGA PROGRAM FUNCTIONED IN BOTH SETTINGS AND AS A HYBRID PROGRAM, AND TO EXPLAIN WHY IT WORKED WELL FOR MOST PARTICIPANTS. METHODS: REALIST PROCESS EVALUATION WAS USED TO EXPLORE THE FACTORS THAT FACILITATED A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION FOR MOST PARTICIPANTS, AND TO CONSIDER WHY IT DID NOT WORK FOR A MINORITY. THIS APPROACH DEVELOPS PROGRAM THEORIES THAT DESCRIBE WHICH MECHANISMS AN INTERVENTION IS (OR IS NOT) ACTIVATING, AND HOW THIS IS MEDIATED BY CONTEXT TO GENERATE PROCESS OUTCOMES. DATA INCLUDED INTERVIEWS WITH PARTICIPANTS (N = 21) AND YOGA INSTRUCTORS (N = 3), SELF-REPORT FEEDBACK FORMS (N = 46), OBSERVATION OF CLASSES AND ROUTINE PROCESS MEASURES. RESULTS: FACTORS THAT FACILITATED A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION FOR MOST PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED THE QUALITY OF YOGA INSTRUCTION, THE PROGRAM FORMAT AND INHERENT CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA. GAINS IN TRANSITIONING ONLINE INCLUDED CONTINUITY AND GREATER CONVENIENCE. LOSSES INCLUDED PERCEIVED REDUCTION IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA INSTRUCTION. THERE WERE GREATER CHALLENGES FOR PEOPLE STRUGGLING WITH PAIN AND IN DISADVANTAGEOUS HOME ENVIRONMENTS. WE IDENTIFIED SIX PROGRAM THEORIES CONFIGURED AROUND 16 MECHANISMS: 1. IT'S WORTH THE EFFORT AND 2. IN EXPERT HANDS (THESE HAD THE SAME MECHANISMS: VALUE EXPECTANCY, THERAPEUTIC ALLIANCE AND ACHIEVEMENT/MASTERY), 3. A COMMUNAL EXPERIENCE (THESE MECHANISMS WERE SHARED EXPERIENCE, SOCIAL CONNECTION, SOCIAL COMPARISON AND PEER CHECKING), 4. PUTTING YOGA WITHIN REACH (ACCESSIBILITY, CONVENIENCE, GRATITUDE), 5. BUILDING YOGA HABITS (PURPOSEFUL STRUCTURE, MOMENTUM, ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTINUITY), AND 6. YOGA'S SPECIAL PROPERTIES (EMBODIMENT AND MINDFULNESS). CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT ONLINE DELIVERY OF A YOGA PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE AGED 60+ RETAINED MUCH OF THE VALUE OF A FACE-TO-FACE PROGRAM FOR THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS, AND INCREASED THE VALUE FOR SOME. THE STRUCTURED, COMMUNAL NATURE OF AN ORGANISED GROUP PROGRAM DELIVERED BY A SKILLED INSTRUCTOR, TOGETHER WITH YOGA'S INTRINSIC FOCUS ON MINDFULNESS, FACILITATED CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT AND PERCEIVED HEALTH BENEFITS, DESPITE THE CHANGE IN DELIVERY MODE.	2022

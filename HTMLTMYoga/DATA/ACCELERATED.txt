1 2668 101 YOGA IN MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER: MOLECULAR MECHANISMS AND CLINICAL UTILITY. MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD) IS A MIND-BODY DISORDER. CELLULAR AGING HAS BEEN IMPLICATED IN THE PATHOGENESIS OF MDD WITH THE ALTERED MIND-BODY COMMUNICATION MARKERS LIKE STRESS RESPONSE, IMMUNE RESPONSE, NUTRITION SENSING, AND A RANGE OF OTHER REGULATORY FEEDBACK SYSTEMS. IN THIS AGE OF SUPER SPECIALIZATIONS, ONE SPECIFIC TARGET AND INTERVENTIONS (PREFERABLY A DRUG) ON IT ARE BEING RIGOROUSLY SOUGHT BY THE HEALTH CARE COMMUNITY AND INDUSTRY, BUT HAVE FAILED IN IT IN THE LAST FIFTY YEARS IN SPITE OF ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY. SINCE, DEPRESSION IS A COMPLEX DISORDER ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED INCIDENCE OF OTHER COMPLEX DISORDERS, IT MUST BE TREATED BY AN INTEGRATED HOLISTIC APPROACH THAT CAN ADDRESS THE COMPLEXITY OF MDD. INTERVENTIONS TARGETING ACCELERATED BIOLOGICAL AGING TO INCREASE CELLULAR HEALTH IN WHOLE BODY HAVE POTENTIAL TO MANAGE COMPLEX CONDITIONS LIKE MDD AND ITS OVERLAPPING SYMPTOMS AND COMORBIDITIES. YOGA HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE THE NEXUS BETWEEN, CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF MDD AND OTHER LIFESTYLE DISEASES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
2 2238  21 THE IMPLEMENTATION OF PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOME MEASURES IN YOGA THERAPY. YOGA THERAPISTS ARE INTERESTED IN KNOWING WHETHER THEIR THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS ARE HELPFUL IN IMPROVING HEALTH AND WELLBEING IN THEIR YOGA THERAPY CLIENTS. HOWEVER, FEW YOGA THERAPISTS USE STANDARDIZED, RELIABLE, AND VALID QUESTIONNAIRES TO DETERMINE THE THERAPEUTIC EFFECTIVENESS OF THEIR TREATMENTS. PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOME (PRO) MEASURES ARE PAPER OR WEB-BASED QUESTIONNAIRES USED TO ASSESS AN INDIVIDUAL'S PERCEPTIONS OF THEIR SYMPTOMS AND/OR QUALITY OF LIFE. IN 2004, THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH) LAUNCHED THE PROMIS((R)) INITIATIVE TO STANDARDIZE AND SIMPLIFY THE COLLECTION OF PROS IN RESEARCH AND IN CLINICAL PRACTICE. THE PROMIS((R)) INITIATIVE LAUNCHED A MULTICENTER COOPERATIVE GROUP THAT COLLECTED AND REVIEWED THOUSANDS OF PROS, THEN EXTENSIVELY TESTED THEM IN OVER 20,000 RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS. THE RESULT WAS A WEB-BASED COLLECTION OF ITEM BANKS OF THE BEST QUESTIONS OR "ITEMS" WITHIN THREE DOMAINS OF INTEREST: PHYSICAL, MENTAL, AND SOCIAL HEALTH. THESE ITEM BANKS ARE HOUSED IN THE ASSESSMENT CENTER, A FREE ONLINE RESOURCE FOR COLLECTING PROS.(1) INCORPORATING PROMIS((R)) OUTCOMES INTO YOGA THERAPY STREAMLINES AND OPTIMIZES THE COLLECTION OF PROS BY ENABLING ACCESS TO RELIABLE AND VALID QUESTIONNAIRES THAT ARE EASY TO READ, SIMPLE TO COMPLETE, AND ARE AVAILABLE IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES AS WELL AS IN BOTH ADULT AND PEDIATRIC VERSIONS. THE USE OF STANDARDIZED PROS MAY IMPROVE YOGA THERAPY IMPLEMENTATION IN HEALTHCARE AND ACCELERATE TRANSLATION OF CLINICAL RESEARCH BY ALLOWING YOGA THERAPISTS TO CONDUCT INDEPTH SYMPTOM ASSESSMENTS USING TOOLS THAT ALLOW FOR COMPARISONS TO OTHER THERAPEUTIC CLINICAL AND RESEARCH INTERVENTIONS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO SUMMARIZE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NIH PROMIS((R)) INITIATIVE AND TO PROVIDE SUGGESTIONS FOR INCORPORATING PRO COLLECTION INTO YOGA THERAPY. IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS TO CONSIDER WHEN IMPLEMENTING PROS INTO YOGA THERAPY ARE DISCUSSED, INCLUDING THE CHOICE OF QUESTIONNAIRES AND METHOD OF DELIVERY (PAPER OR WEB-BASED), FREQUENCY OF PRO ADMINISTRATION, INTERPRETATION AND MANAGEMENT OF PRO RESULTS, AND THE MANAGEMENT OF PROBLEMATIC ISSUES THAT ARISE.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
3 1409  26 IMPACT OF YOGA ON PERIODONTAL DISEASE AND STRESS MANAGEMENT. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT, EFFECTIVE, AND VALUABLE TOOLS AVAILABLE FOR MAN TO OVERCOME VARIOUS PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS. STRESS CONTRIBUTES SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE PATHOGENESIS OF PERIODONTAL DISEASES; HENCE, IT BECOMES IMPORTANT TO REDUCE THE LEVEL OF STRESS FOR PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF DISEASES. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: THE PRESENT STUDY WAS AIMED: (1) TO UNDERSTAND AND ANALYZE THE POSSIBILITIES OF EMPLOYING YOGIC PRACTICES IN THE TREATMENT OF PERIODONTAL DISEASE ALONG WITH CONVENTIONAL DENTAL THERAPY, (2) TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECT OF STRESS ON PERIODONTAL TREATMENT OUTCOME, (3) TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PERIODONTAL DISEASE WITH REFERENCE TO STRESS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AN OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENT-BASED PARALLEL GROUP RANDOMIZED STUDY WAS PERFORMED WITH STANDARD TREATMENT FOR PERIODONTAL DISEASE YOGA THERAPY AS GROUP II AND ONLY STANDARD TREATMENT AS GROUP I. PERIODONTAL HEALTH STATUS WAS RECORDED USING INDICES OF MODIFIED PLAQUE INDEX (PI), BLEEDING ON PROBING (BOP), PROBING DEPTH, AND CLINICAL ATTACHMENT LOSS (CAL). THE COHEN'S PERCEIVED STRESS QUESTIONNAIRE WAS ALSO USED TO DETERMINE STRESS SEVERITY. THE YOGIC INTERVENTION CONSISTS OF LECTURES AND PRACTICAL SESSIONS ON ASANAS, PRANAYAMA, KRIYAS, AND MEDITATION. RESULTS: REPEATED MEASURE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE (P < 0.001) IN ALL THE OUTCOME VARIABLES WITH RESPECT TO TIME IN BOTH GROUPS. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT MEAN PI SCORE REDUCED BY 1.35 IN GROUP II AS COMPARED TO 0.54 IN GROUP I, MEAN PROBING POCKET DEPTH REDUCED BY 1.60 IN GROUP II AS COMPARED TO ONLY 0.68 IN GROUP I, AND MEAN CAL SCORE REDUCED BY 1.60 IN GROUP II AS COMPARED TO 0.68 IN GROUP I. SIMILARLY, COHEN'S PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE SCORE ALSO REDUCED BY 18.76 POINTS IN GROUP II AS COMPARED TO ONLY 2.58 POINTS IN GROUP I, BOP ALSO SHOWS BETTER IMPROVEMENT IN GROUP II WITH A REDUCTION OF 0.68 AS COMPARED TO REDUCTION OF ONLY 0.08 IN GROUP I. THE RESULTS OBTAINED ASCERTAINED THE ROLE OF YOGA IN STRESS REDUCTION IN PERIODONTAL DISEASE. CONCLUSION: ALTHOUGH YOGA DOES NOT PLAY A DIRECT ROLE IN IMPROVING PERIODONTAL DISEASE, IT ACCELERATES THE TREATMENT OUTCOMES BY COMBATING THE STRESS WHICH IS A MAJOR FACTOR AFFECTING THE TREATMENT OF PERIODONTAL DISEASE.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
4 2454  30 YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR METABOLIC SYNDROME: A NARRATIVE REVIEW. METABOLIC SYNDROME (MS) IS ASSOCIATED WITH A SEDENTARY AND STRESSFUL LIFESTYLE AND AFFECTS UNDERACTIVE PEOPLE DISPROPORTIONATELY. YOGA IS CONSIDERED TO BE A LOW-IMPACT MIND-BODY STRESS-RELIEVING EXERCISE, AND RESEARCHERS ARE INCREASING THEIR FOCUS ON THE BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR MANAGING METABOLIC DISORDERS. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR PHYSICIANS AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS TO UNDERSTAND THE THERAPEUTIC EFFICACY OF YOGA INTERVENTION, IN TERMS OF ITS TYPE, DURATION AND FREQUENCY ON VARIOUS MS RISK FACTORS. THE PRESENT REVIEW SUMMARIZES THE CURRENT SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON MS RISK FACTORS SUCH AS GLUCOSE HOMEOSTASIS MARKERS, LIPID PROFILE, ADIPOCYTOKINES AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS, AND DISCUSSES THE POSSIBLE MECHANISMS OF ACTION. MEDLINE, PUBMED, SCOPUS AND COCHRANE LIBRARY WERE SEARCHED FROM THEIR INCEPTION UP TO DECEMBER 2019, USING THE KEYWORDS "METABOLIC SYNDROME," "DIABETES," "CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES," "OBESITY" AND "YOGA." THE LITERATURE SUMMARIZED IN THIS REVIEW HAVE SHOWN MIXED EFFECTS OF YOGA ON MS RISK FACTORS AND DO NOT PROVIDE ROBUST EVIDENCE FOR ITS EFFICACY. MORE RIGOROUS RESEARCH AND WELL-DESIGNED TRIALS THAT HAVE A HIGHER STANDARD OF METHODOLOGY AND EVALUATE YOGA'S LONG-TERM IMPACTS ON MS ARE NEEDED. UNDERSTANDING YOGA'S BIOCHEMICAL AND MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF ACTION ON VARIOUS METABOLIC PATHWAYS IS ALSO NEEDED.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
5 2543  32 YOGA FOR ASTHMA. BACKGROUND: ASTHMA IS A COMMON CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY DISORDER AFFECTING ABOUT 300 MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE. AS A HOLISTIC THERAPY, YOGA HAS THE POTENTIAL TO RELIEVE BOTH THE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SUFFERING OF PEOPLE WITH ASTHMA, AND ITS POPULARITY HAS EXPANDED GLOBALLY. A NUMBER OF CLINICAL TRIALS HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA PRACTICE, WITH INCONSISTENT RESULTS. OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN PEOPLE WITH ASTHMA. SEARCH METHODS: WE SYSTEMATICALLY SEARCHED THE COCHRANE AIRWAYS GROUP REGISTER OF TRIALS, WHICH IS DERIVED FROM SYSTEMATIC SEARCHES OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATABASES INCLUDING THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, AND PSYCINFO, AND HANDSEARCHING OF RESPIRATORY JOURNALS AND MEETING ABSTRACTS. WE ALSO SEARCHED PEDRO. WE SEARCHED CLINICALTRIALS.GOV AND THE WHO ICTRP SEARCH PORTAL. WE SEARCHED ALL DATABASES FROM THEIR INCEPTION TO 22 JULY 2015, AND USED NO RESTRICTION ON LANGUAGE OF PUBLICATION. WE CHECKED THE REFERENCE LISTS OF ELIGIBLE STUDIES AND RELEVANT REVIEW ARTICLES FOR ADDITIONAL STUDIES. WE ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT INVESTIGATORS OF ELIGIBLE STUDIES AND EXPERTS IN THE FIELD TO LEARN OF OTHER PUBLISHED AND UNPUBLISHED STUDIES. SELECTION CRITERIA: WE INCLUDED RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) THAT COMPARED YOGA WITH USUAL CARE (OR NO INTERVENTION) OR SHAM INTERVENTION IN PEOPLE WITH ASTHMA AND REPORTED AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING OUTCOMES: QUALITY OF LIFE, ASTHMA SYMPTOM SCORE, ASTHMA CONTROL, LUNG FUNCTION MEASURES, ASTHMA MEDICATION USAGE, AND ADVERSE EVENTS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: WE EXTRACTED BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, CHARACTERISTICS OF PARTICIPANTS, CHARACTERISTICS OF INTERVENTIONS AND CONTROLS, CHARACTERISTICS OF METHODOLOGY, AND RESULTS FOR THE OUTCOMES OF OUR INTEREST FROM ELIGIBLE STUDIES. FOR CONTINUOUS OUTCOMES, WE USED MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) WITH 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) TO DENOTE THE TREATMENT EFFECTS, IF THE OUTCOMES WERE MEASURED BY THE SAME SCALE ACROSS STUDIES. ALTERNATIVELY, IF THE OUTCOMES WERE MEASURED BY DIFFERENT SCALES ACROSS STUDIES, WE USED STANDARDISED MEAN DIFFERENCE (SMD) WITH 95% CI. FOR DICHOTOMOUS OUTCOMES, WE USED RISK RATIO (RR) WITH 95% CI TO MEASURE THE TREATMENT EFFECTS. WE PERFORMED META-ANALYSIS WITH REVIEW MANAGER 5.3. WE USED THE FIXED-EFFECT MODEL TO POOL THE DATA, UNLESS THERE WAS SUBSTANTIAL HETEROGENEITY AMONG STUDIES, IN WHICH CASE WE USED THE RANDOM-EFFECTS MODEL INSTEAD. FOR OUTCOMES INAPPROPRIATE OR IMPOSSIBLE TO POOL QUANTITATIVELY, WE CONDUCTED A DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS AND SUMMARISED THE FINDINGS NARRATIVELY. MAIN RESULTS: WE INCLUDED 15 RCTS WITH A TOTAL OF 1048 PARTICIPANTS. MOST OF THE TRIALS WERE CONDUCTED IN INDIA, FOLLOWED BY EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES. THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS WERE ADULTS OF BOTH SEXES WITH MILD TO MODERATE ASTHMA FOR SIX MONTHS TO MORE THAN 23 YEARS. FIVE STUDIES INCLUDED YOGA BREATHING ALONE, WHILE THE OTHER STUDIES ASSESSED YOGA INTERVENTIONS THAT INCLUDED BREATHING, POSTURE, AND MEDITATION. INTERVENTIONS LASTED FROM TWO WEEKS TO 54 MONTHS, FOR NO MORE THAN SIX MONTHS IN THE MAJORITY OF STUDIES. THE RISK OF BIAS WAS LOW ACROSS ALL DOMAINS IN ONE STUDY AND UNCLEAR OR HIGH IN AT LEAST ONE DOMAIN FOR THE REMAINDER.THERE WAS SOME EVIDENCE THAT YOGA MAY IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE (MD IN ASTHMA QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE (AQLQ) SCORE PER ITEM 0.57 UNITS ON A 7-POINT SCALE, 95% CI 0.37 TO 0.77; 5 STUDIES; 375 PARTICIPANTS), IMPROVE SYMPTOMS (SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.09 TO 0.65; 3 STUDIES; 243 PARTICIPANTS), AND REDUCE MEDICATION USAGE (RR 5.35, 95% CI 1.29 TO 22.11; 2 STUDIES) IN PEOPLE WITH ASTHMA. THE MD FOR AQLQ SCORE EXCEEDED THE MINIMAL CLINICALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE (MCID) OF 0.5, BUT WHETHER THE MEAN CHANGES EXCEEDED THE MCID FOR ASTHMA SYMPTOMS IS UNCERTAIN DUE TO THE LACK OF AN ESTABLISHED MCID IN THE SEVERITY SCORES USED IN THE INCLUDED STUDIES. THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CHANGE FROM BASELINE FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN ONE SECOND (MD 0.04 LITRES, 95% CI -0.10 TO 0.19; 7 STUDIES; 340 PARTICIPANTS; I(2) = 68%) WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. TWO STUDIES INDICATED IMPROVED ASTHMA CONTROL, BUT DUE TO VERY SIGNIFICANT HETEROGENEITY (I(2) = 98%) WE DID NOT POOL DATA. NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA WERE REPORTED, BUT THE DATA ON THIS OUTCOME WAS LIMITED. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: WE FOUND MODERATE-QUALITY EVIDENCE THAT YOGA PROBABLY LEADS TO SMALL IMPROVEMENTS IN QUALITY OF LIFE AND SYMPTOMS IN PEOPLE WITH ASTHMA. THERE IS MORE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND ITS IMPACT ON LUNG FUNCTION AND MEDICATION USAGE. RCTS WITH A LARGE SAMPLE SIZE AND HIGH METHODOLOGICAL AND REPORTING QUALITY ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM THE EFFECTS OF YOGA FOR ASTHMA.	2016	

6 1927  24 ROLE OF YOGA IN CARDIAC DISEASE AND REHABILITATION. PURPOSE: CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE CONTINUES TO BE THE LEADING CAUSE OF MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY AROUND THE WORLD. YOGA, A COMBINATION OF PHYSICAL POSTURES (ASANA), BREATHING EXERCISES (PRANAYAMA), AND MEDITATION (DHYANA), HAS GAINED INCREASING RECOGNITION AS A FORM OF MIND-BODY EXERCISE. IN THIS NARRATIVE REVIEW, WE INTENDED TO REVIEW THE EMERGING EVIDENCE ASSESSING THE PHYSIOLOGIC AND CLINICAL EFFECTS OF YOGA ON THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM AND THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF YOGA AS A COMPONENT OF COMPREHENSIVE CARDIAC REHABILITATION. METHODS: WE SEARCHED PUBMED, GOOGLE SCHOLAR, EMBASE, AND COCHRANE DATABASES FOR LITERATURE RELATED TO CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS OF YOGA FROM INCEPTION UP UNTIL 2017. RESULTS: YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE FAVORABLE EFFECTS ON SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION, STRESS, THE CARDIAC AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM, AND TRADITIONAL AND EMERGING CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA HAS SHOWN PROMISE AS A USEFUL LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION THAT CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE MANAGEMENT ALGORITHMS. ALTHOUGH MANY INVESTIGATORS HAVE REPORTED THE CLINICAL BENEFITS OF YOGA IN REDUCING CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS, MORBIDITY, AND MORTALITY, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THESE CONCLUSIONS IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED, THEREBY EMPHASIZING THE NEED FOR LARGE, WELL-DESIGNED RANDOMIZED TRIALS THAT MINIMIZE BIAS AND METHODOLOGICAL DRAWBACKS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
7  921  29 EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AS THE PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION MODULE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES AND DIABETES ASSOCIATED DEMENTIA IN SOUTH EAST ASIA: A NARRATIVE REVIEW. BACKGROUND: DIABETES MELLITUS (DM) IS WIDELY SPREAD IN SOUTH ASIAN (ASEAN) AND INDIAN SUB-CONTINENT. THE INCREASING HEALTHCARE COSTS OF DM CAN BE PREVENTED IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD BY IMPROVED PUBLIC HEALTHCARE INTERVENTIONS. MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS OF DM LIKE SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE, OBESITY, AND STRESSFUL CONDITIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ITS PROGRESSION; HOWEVER, THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA COLLECTED BY PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS ARE LIMITED. SUMMARY: A REVIEW OF PUBLISHED LITERATURE DESCRIBING GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF DM AND ASSOCIATED DEMENTIA IN SOUTH ASIAN REGION, PARTICULARLY INDIA, WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE PURPOSE OF ASSESSING THE FEASIBILITY AND CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE YOGA-BASED RISK REDUCTION. PUBMED AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR DM AND DEMENTIA-RELATED ARTICLES BY USING A COMBINATION OF KEYWORDS: DIABETES, DIABETES RELATED DEMENTIA SOUTHEAST ASIA, PRE-DIABETES, YOGA, LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION, DEMENTIA AND EXERCISE. THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA GENERATED FROM THESE DISEASES HAVE NOT PROMPTED TO ANY MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH POLICIES. YOGA CAN BE A COST-EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR THE PREVENTION OF TYPE 2 DM (T2DM) AND ITS ASSOCIATED COGNITIVE DECLINE WHEN DETECTED EARLY. IF NATIONWIDE INTERVENTION OF YOGA IS BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE STATE, ITS INTEGRATION IN HEALTH CARE WILL BECOME MORE MEANINGFUL AND ACCEPTABLE. KEY MESSAGE: STUDIES SUGGEST THAT YOGA AND CHANGE IN LIFESTYLE CAN MODIFY THE HEALTH RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH T2DM AND ASSOCIATED DEMENTIA IF IT IS MAINSTREAMED WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH INITIATIVE OF AYUSHMAN BHARAT SCHEME.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
8 2245  27 THE INFLUENCE OF YOGA-BASED PROGRAMS ON RISK PROFILES IN ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE THAT YOGA MAY OFFER A SAFE AND COST-EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM 2). HOWEVER, SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS ARE LACKING. THIS ARTICLE CRITICALLY REVIEWS THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA-BASED PROGRAMS ON PHYSIOLOGIC AND ANTHROPOMETRIC RISK PROFILES AND RELATED CLINICAL OUTCOMES IN ADULTS WITH DM 2. WE PERFORMED A COMPREHENSIVE LITERATURE SEARCH USING FOUR COMPUTERIZED ENGLISH AND INDIAN SCIENTIFIC DATABASES. THE SEARCH WAS RESTRICTED TO ORIGINAL STUDIES (1970-2006) THAT EVALUATED THE METABOLIC AND CLINICAL EFFECTS OF YOGA IN ADULTS WITH DM 2. STUDIES TARGETING CLINICAL POPULATIONS WITH CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS THAT INCLUDED ADULTS WITH COMORBID DM WERE ALSO EVALUATED. DATA WERE EXTRACTED REGARDING STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, TARGET POPULATION, INTERVENTION, COMPARISON GROUP OR CONDITION, OUTCOME ASSESSMENT, DATA ANALYSIS AND PRESENTATION, FOLLOW-UP, AND KEY RESULTS, AND THE QUALITY OF EACH STUDY WAS EVALUATED ACCORDING TO SPECIFIC PREDETERMINED CRITERIA. WE IDENTIFIED 25 ELIGIBLE STUDIES, INCLUDING 15 UNCONTROLLED TRIALS, 6 NON-RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS AND 4 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS). OVERALL, THESE STUDIES SUGGEST BENEFICIAL CHANGES IN SEVERAL RISK INDICES, INCLUDING GLUCOSE TOLERANCE AND INSULIN SENSITIVITY, LIPID PROFILES, ANTHROPOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS, BLOOD PRESSURE, OXIDATIVE STRESS, COAGULATION PROFILES, SYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION AND PULMONARY FUNCTION, AS WELL AS IMPROVEMENT IN SPECIFIC CLINICAL OUTCOMES. YOGA MAY IMPROVE RISK PROFILES IN ADULTS WITH DM 2, AND MAY HAVE PROMISE FOR THE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF CARDIOVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS IN THIS POPULATION. HOWEVER, THE LIMITATIONS CHARACTERIZING MOST STUDIES PRECLUDE DRAWING FIRM CONCLUSIONS. ADDITIONAL HIGH-QUALITY RCTS ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM AND FURTHER ELUCIDATE THE EFFECTS OF STANDARDIZED YOGA PROGRAMS IN POPULATIONS WITH DM 2.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
9 1661  25 NARRATIVE REVIEW OF YOGA INTERVENTION CLINICAL TRIALS INCLUDING WEIGHT-RELATED OUTCOMES. CONTEXT: MEDICAL AUTHORITIES HAVE IDENTIFIED OBESITY AS A CAUSAL FACTOR IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIABETES, HYPERTENSION, AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (CVD), AND MORE BROADLY, OF METABOLIC SYNDROME/INSULIN RESISTANCE SYNDROME. TO PROVIDE SOLUTIONS THAT CAN MODIFY THIS RISK FACTOR, RESEARCHERS NEED TO IDENTIFY METHODS OF EFFECTIVE RISK REDUCTION AND PRIMARY PREVENTION OF OBESITY. RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AS A TREATMENT FOR OBESITY IS LIMITED, AND STUDIES VARY IN OVERALL QUALITY AND METHODOLOGICAL RIGOR. OBJECTIVE: THIS NARRATIVE REVIEW ASSESSED THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF CLINICAL TRIALS OF YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR WEIGHT LOSS OR AS A MEANS OF RISK REDUCTION OR TREATMENT FOR OBESITY AND DISEASES IN WHICH OBESITY IS A CAUSAL FACTOR. THIS REVIEW SUMMARIZED THE STUDIES' RESEARCH DESIGNS AND EVALUATED THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR WEIGHT LOSS VIA THE CURRENT EVIDENCE BASE. DESIGN: THE RESEARCH TEAM EVALUATED PUBLISHED STUDIES TO DETERMINE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF RESEARCH DESIGNS, COMPARABILITY OF PROGRAMS' INTERVENTION ELEMENTS, AND STANDARDIZATION OF OUTCOME MEASURES. THE RESEARCH TEAM'S LITERATURE SEARCH USED THE KEY TERMS YOGA AND OBESITY OR YOGA AND WEIGHT LOSS IN THREE PRIMARY MEDICAL-LITERATURE DATABASES (PUBMED, PSYCHINFO, AND WEB OF SCIENCE). THE STUDY EXCLUDED CLINICAL TRIALS WITH NO QUANTITATIVE OBESITY RELATED MEASURE. EXTRACTED DATA INCLUDED EACH STUDY'S (1) DESIGN; (2) SETTING AND POPULATION; (3) NATURE, DURATION, AND FREQUENCY OF INTERVENTIONS; (4) COMPARISON GROUPS; (5) RECRUITMENT STRATEGIES; (6) OUTCOME MEASURES; (7) DATA ANALYSIS AND PRESENTATION; AND (8) RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS. THE RESEARCH TEAM DEVELOPED AN OVERALL EVALUATION PARAMETER TO COMPARE DISPARATE TRIALS. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE RESEARCH TEAM REVIEWED EACH STUDY TO DETERMINE ITS KEY FEATURES, EACH WORTH A SPECIFIED NUMBER OF POINTS, WITH A MAXIMUM TOTAL OF 20 POINTS. THE FEATURES INCLUDED A STUDY'S (1) DURATION, (2) FREQUENCY OF YOGA PRACTICE, (3) INTENSITY OF (LENGTH OF) EACH PRACTICE, (4) NUMBER OF YOGIC ELEMENTS, (5) INCLUSION OF DIETARY MODIFICATION, (6) INCLUSION OF A RESIDENTIAL COMPONENT, (7) THE NUMBER OF WEIGHT-RELATED OUTCOME MEASURES, AND (8) A DISCUSSION OF THE DETAILS OF THE YOGIC ELEMENTS. RESULTS: OVERALL, THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAMS ARE FREQUENTLY EFFECTIVE IN PROMOTING WEIGHT LOSS AND/OR IMPROVEMENTS IN BODY COMPOSITION. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR WEIGHT LOSS IS RELATED TO THE FOLLOWING KEY FEATURES: (1) AN INCREASED FREQUENCY OF PRACTICE; (2) A LONGER INTERVENTION DURATION (3) A YOGIC DIETARY COMPONENT; (4) A RESIDENTIAL COMPONENT; (5) THE COMPREHENSIVE INCLUSION OF YOGIC COMPONENTS; (5) AND A HOME-PRACTICE COMPONENT. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA APPEARS TO BE AN APPROPRIATE AND POTENTIALLY SUCCESSFUL INTERVENTION FOR WEIGHT MAINTENANCE, PREVENTION OF OBESITY, AND RISK REDUCTION FOR DISEASES IN WHICH OBESITY PLAYS A SIGNIFICANT CAUSAL ROLE.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
10 1185  34 EVIDENCE BASE OF YOGA STUDIES ON CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH: A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS. NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES INCLUDING CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE CONTRIBUTE TO APPROXIMATELY 50% OF GLOBAL MORTALITY. PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT ALONE MAY NOT BE A PANACEA FOR SUCH DISEASES SINCE IT MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS OTHER ADVERSE EFFECTS. HENCE, STRATEGIES SUCH AS YOGA INVOLVING HEALTHY LIFESTYLE AND STRESS MANAGEMENT ARE WIDELY SOUGHT BY THE PATIENT POPULATION. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AN ELECTRONIC SEARCH OF PUBMED AS A STANDARD BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATABASE WAS PERFORMED THROUGH FEBRUARY 2015 USING THE KEYWORDS "YOGA" AND "CARDIOVASCULAR." STUDIES WITH YOGA AS THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE AND PARAMETERS RELATED TO CARDIAC HEALTH AS THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE WERE INCLUDED AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA WERE APPLIED. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 149 PUBLICATIONS WERE IDENTIFIED WHICH MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ANALYSIS. OF THE TOTAL PUBLICATIONS, 44% WERE CLINICAL TRIALS OF WHICH 19% WERE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WHICH MAY BE CATEGORIZED AS HIGH-QUALITY ONES. AN UPWARD TREND IN THE OVERALL RESEARCH IN THIS AREA IS EVIDENT. MAJOR WORK HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BY RESEARCHERS OF THE UNITED STATES (38%) AND INDIA (29%). CONCLUSION: THE SURVEY INDICATES THAT THE NUMBER OF PUBLICATIONS IN THE FIELD OF "YOGA" AND "CARDIOVASCULAR" HEALTH HAS INCREASED RAPIDLY IN THE LATE YEARS. ANALYSIS COMPRISING THE NATION/STATE HELPS DEFINE ITS STATUS WITH REGARD TO ITS COUNTERPARTS AND HELPS UNDERSTAND SCIENCE PRIORITIES AND DISEASE CONTROL STRATEGIES IN AN EFFORT TO PROVIDE COST-EFFECTIVENESS AND QUALITY CONTROL. THERE IS A NEED FOR FURTHER HIGH-QUALITY STUDIES IN THE FIELD OF "YOGA" AND "CARDIOVASCULAR" DISEASES TO VALIDATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON HEALTH PARAMETERS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
11 2629  28 YOGA FOR THE PRIMARY PREVENTION OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. BACKGROUND: A SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE AND STRESS ARE MAJOR RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (CVD). SINCE YOGA INVOLVES EXERCISE AND IS THOUGHT TO HELP IN STRESS REDUCTION IT MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY IN THE PRIMARY PREVENTION OF CVD. OBJECTIVES: TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF ANY TYPE OF YOGA ON THE PRIMARY PREVENTION OF CVD. SEARCH METHODS: WE SEARCHED THE FOLLOWING ELECTRONIC DATABASES: THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL) (2013, ISSUE 11) IN THE COCHRANE LIBRARY; MEDLINE (OVID) (1946 TO NOVEMBER WEEK 3 2013); EMBASE CLASSIC + EMBASE (OVID) (1947 TO 2013 WEEK 48); WEB OF SCIENCE (THOMSON REUTERS) (1970 TO 4 DECEMBER 2013); DATABASE OF ABSTRACTS OF REVIEWS OF EFFECTS (DARE), HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT DATABASE AND HEALTH ECONOMICS EVALUATIONS DATABASE (ISSUE 4 OF 4, 2013) IN THE COCHRANE LIBRARY. WE ALSO SEARCHED A NUMBER OF ASIAN DATABASES AND THE ALLIED AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE DATABASE (AMED) (INCEPTION TO DECEMBER 2012). WE SEARCHED TRIAL REGISTERS AND REFERENCE LISTS OF REVIEWS AND ARTICLES, AND APPROACHED EXPERTS IN THE FIELD. WE APPLIED NO LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS. SELECTION CRITERIA: RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS LASTING AT LEAST THREE MONTHS INVOLVING HEALTHY ADULTS OR THOSE AT HIGH RISK OF CVD. TRIALS EXAMINED ANY TYPE OF YOGA AND THE COMPARISON GROUP WAS NO INTERVENTION OR MINIMAL INTERVENTION. OUTCOMES OF INTEREST WERE CLINICAL CVD EVENTS AND MAJOR CVD RISK FACTORS. WE DID NOT INCLUDE ANY TRIALS THAT INVOLVED MULTIFACTORIAL LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS OR WEIGHT LOSS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: TWO AUTHORS INDEPENDENTLY SELECTED TRIALS FOR INCLUSION, EXTRACTED DATA AND ASSESSED THE RISK OF BIAS. MAIN RESULTS: WE IDENTIFIED 11 TRIALS (800 PARTICIPANTS) AND TWO ONGOING STUDIES. STYLE AND DURATION OF YOGA DIFFERED BETWEEN TRIALS. HALF OF THE PARTICIPANTS RECRUITED TO THE STUDIES WERE AT HIGH RISK OF CVD. MOST OF STUDIES WERE AT RISK OF PERFORMANCE BIAS, WITH INADEQUATE DETAILS REPORTED IN MANY OF THEM TO JUDGE THE RISK OF SELECTION BIAS.NO STUDY REPORTED CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY, ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY OR NON-FATAL EVENTS, AND MOST STUDIES WERE SMALL AND SHORT-TERM. THERE WAS SUBSTANTIAL HETEROGENEITY BETWEEN STUDIES MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO COMBINE STUDIES STATISTICALLY FOR SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND TOTAL CHOLESTEROL. YOGA WAS FOUND TO PRODUCE REDUCTIONS IN DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) -2.90 MMHG, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) -4.52 TO -1.28), WHICH WAS STABLE ON SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, TRIGLYCERIDES (MD -0.27 MMOL/L, 95% CI -0.44 TO -0.11) AND HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (HDL) CHOLESTEROL (MD 0.08 MMOL/L, 95% CI 0.02 TO 0.14). HOWEVER, THE CONTRIBUTING STUDIES WERE SMALL, SHORT-TERM AND AT UNCLEAR OR HIGH RISK OF BIAS. THERE WAS NO CLEAR EVIDENCE OF A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS FOR LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (LDL) CHOLESTEROL (MD -0.09 MMOL/L, 95% CI -0.48 TO 0.30), ALTHOUGH THERE WAS MODERATE STATISTICAL HETEROGENEITY. ADVERSE EVENTS, OCCURRENCE OF TYPE 2 DIABETES AND COSTS WERE NOT REPORTED IN ANY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES. QUALITY OF LIFE WAS MEASURED IN THREE TRIALS BUT THE RESULTS WERE INCONCLUSIVE. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: THE LIMITED EVIDENCE COMES FROM SMALL, SHORT-TERM, LOW-QUALITY STUDIES. THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT YOGA HAS FAVOURABLE EFFECTS ON DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE, HDL CHOLESTEROL AND TRIGLYCERIDES, AND UNCERTAIN EFFECTS ON LDL CHOLESTEROL. THESE RESULTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS EXPLORATORY AND INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
12  588  28 DETERMINING PSYCHONEUROIMMUNOLOGIC MARKERS OF YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR PERSONS DIAGNOSED WITH PTSD: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. THERE IS A GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH ON YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS OF POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) ACCOMPANIED BY SPECULATIONS ON UNDERLYING PHYSIOLOGIC MECHANISMS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW IS TO IDENTIFY, QUALITATIVELY EVALUATE, AND SYNTHESIZE STUDIES OF YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR PTSD THAT MEASURED PHYSIOLOGIC OUTCOMES IN ORDER TO GAIN INSIGHTS INTO POTENTIAL MECHANISMS. THE FOCUS IS ON STUDIES EVALUATING YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION FOR PTSD RATHER THAN FOR TRAUMA EXPOSURE, PTSD PREVENTION, OR SUBCLINICAL PTSD. MULTIPLE DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR PUBLICATIONS FROM THE PAST TWO DECADES USING TERMS DERIVED FROM THE QUESTION, "IN PEOPLE WITH PTSD, WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON OBJECTIVE OUTCOMES?" ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA INCLUDED YOGA-ONLY MODALITIES TESTED AS AN INTERVENTION FOR FORMALLY DIAGNOSED PTSD WITH AT LEAST ONE PHYSIOLOGIC OUTCOME. RESULTS OF THIS REVIEW CONFIRMED THAT, THOUGH MUCH OF THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE PROPOSES PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS UNDERLYING YOGA'S EFFECTS ON PTSD, VERY FEW STUDIES ( N = 3) HAVE ACTUALLY EVALUATED PHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE. ADDITIONALLY, SEVERAL STUDIES HAD METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS. IN LIGHT OF THE LIMITED DATA SUPPORTING YOGA'S BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM DYSREGULATION, WE PRESENT A THEORETICAL MODEL OF THE PSYCHONEUROIMMUNOLOGIC PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH PTSD AND THE EFFECTS YOGA MAY HAVE ON THESE PROCESSES TO GUIDE FUTURE RESEARCH. GAPS IN THE LITERATURE REMAIN FOR MECHANISMS RELATED TO ACTIVATION OF THE HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-ADRENAL AXIS AND INFLAMMATION. ADDITIONAL RIGOROUS MECHANISTIC STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO GUIDE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR PTSD TO AUGMENT EXISTING EVIDENCE-BASED PTSD TREATMENTS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
13 2858  19 YOGA-BASED CARDIAC REHABILITATION: CURRENT PERSPECTIVES FROM RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS IN CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE. CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE CARRIES A HIGH MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY WORLDWIDE, AND EXERCISE-BASED CARDIAC REHABILITATION PROGRAMMES PLAY A LARGE ROLE IN SECONDARY PREVENTION. EXERCISE-BASED REHABILITATION PROGRAMMES ARE EXPENSIVE, AND IN CERTAIN SUBGROUPS UPTAKE IS POOR. YOGA HAS BEEN SUGGESTED TO SHOW IMPROVEMENTS IN CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH WHICH WOULD SUPPORT ITS USE IN CARDIAC REHABILITATION PROGRAMMES. WE CARRIED OUT A REVIEW OF CURRENT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS TO DETERMINE IF YOGA-BASED CARDIAC REHABILITATION LEADS TO REDUCED CARDIAC RISK FACTORS, AND IMPROVED PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS WITH CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE COMPARED TO STANDARD CARE. SIX RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDIES WERE IDENTIFIED AFTER A MEDICAL DATABASE SEARCH, AND META-ANALYSIS WAS CARRIED OUT FOR THE DIFFERENT OUTCOMES. OVERALL, THE ADDITION OF YOGA TO STANDARD CARE RESULTED IN IMPROVED SUBJECTIVE FEELING OF CARDIAC HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE. THERE WAS ALSO A TREND TOWARDS IMPROVEMENT IN LEFT VENTRICULAR SYSTOLIC FUNCTION. IMPROVEMENT IN CARDIAC RISK FACTORS, MACE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH IN THIS COHORT HAS STILL TO BE PROVEN, BUT WAS NOT INFERIOR TO STANDARD OR ENHANCED CARE, AND THE BENEFITS BECAME MORE PRONOUNCED AT LONGER FOLLOW-UP. FUTURE STUDIES WITH LONGER FOLLOW-UP AND LARGER PATIENT NUMBERS WOULD AID IN ACCURATELY ASSESSING THE LONG-TERM BENEFIT OF YOGA-BASED REHABILITATION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
14 2416  23 YOGA AND MEDITATION IN CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. YOGA IS A HOLISTIC MIND-BODY INTERVENTION AIMED AT PHYSICAL, MENTAL, EMOTIONAL AND SPIRITUAL WELL BEING. SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT YOGA AND/OR MEDITATION CAN CONTROL RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE LIKE HYPERTENSION, TYPE II DIABETES AND INSULIN RESISTANCE, OBESITY, LIPID PROFILE, PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS AND SMOKING. SOME RANDOMIZED STUDIES SUGGEST THAT YOGA/MEDITATION COULD RETARD OR EVEN REGRESS EARLY AND ADVANCED CORONARY ATHEROSCLEROSIS. A RECENT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT TRANSCENDENTAL MEDITATION MAY BE EXTREMELY USEFUL IN SECONDARY PREVENTION OF CORONARY HEART DISEASE AND MAY REDUCE CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS BY 48% OVER A 5-YEAR PERIOD. ANOTHER SMALL STUDY SUGGESTS THAT YOGA MAY BE HELPFUL IN PREVENTION OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. HOWEVER, MOST STUDIES HAVE SEVERAL LIMITATIONS LIKE LACK OF ADEQUATE CONTROLS, SMALL SAMPLE SIZE, INCONSISTENCIES IN BASELINE AND DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES, ETC. AND THEREFORE LARGE TRIALS WITH IMPROVED METHODOLOGIES ARE REQUIRED TO CONFIRM THESE FINDINGS. HOWEVER, IN VIEW OF THE EXISTING KNOWLEDGE AND YOGA BEING A COST-EFFECTIVE TECHNIQUE WITHOUT SIDE EFFECTS, IT APPEARS APPROPRIATE TO INCORPORATE YOGA/MEDITATION FOR PRIMARY AND SECONDARY PREVENTION OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
15 2850  27 YOGA, MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION AND STRESS-RELATED PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES: A META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: PRACTICES THAT INCLUDE YOGA ASANAS AND MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF STRESS ARE INCREASINGLY POPULAR; HOWEVER, THE NEUROBIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF THESE PRACTICES ON STRESS REACTIVITY ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD. MANY STUDIES INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTS OF SUCH PRACTICES FAIL TO INCLUDE AN ACTIVE CONTROL GROUP. GIVEN THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH PEOPLE ARE SELECTING SUCH INTERVENTIONS AS A FORM OF SELF-MANAGEMENT, IT IS IMPORTANT TO DETERMINE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS. THUS, THIS REVIEW INVESTIGATES THE EFFECTS OF PRACTICES THAT INCLUDE YOGA ASANAS, WITH AND WITHOUT MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION, COMPARED TO AN ACTIVE CONTROL, ON PHYSIOLOGICAL MARKERS OF STRESS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH COMPARED PRACTICES THAT INCLUDED YOGA ASANAS, WITH AND WITHOUT MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION, TO AN ACTIVE CONTROL, ON STRESS-RELATED PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES. THE REVIEW FOCUSED ON STUDIES THAT MEASURED PHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS SUCH AS BLOOD PRESSURE, HEART RATE, CORTISOL AND PERIPHERAL CYTOKINE EXPRESSION. MEDLINE, AMED, CINAHL, PSYCINFO, SOCINDEX, PUBMED, AND SCOPUS WERE SEARCHED IN MAY 2016 AND UPDATED IN DECEMBER 2016. RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE INCLUDED IF THEY ASSESSED AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING OUTCOMES: HEART RATE, BLOOD PRESSURE, HEART RATE VARIABILITY, MEAN ARTERIAL PRESSURE, C-REACTIVE PROTEIN, INTERLEUKINS OR CORTISOL. RISK OF BIAS ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED SEQUENCE GENERATION, ALLOCATION CONCEALMENT, BLINDING OF ASSESSORS, INCOMPLETE OUTCOME DATA, SELECTIVE OUTCOME REPORTING AND OTHER SOURCES OF BIAS. META-ANALYSIS WAS UNDERTAKEN USING COMPREHENSIVE META-ANALYSIS SOFTWARE VERSION 3. SENSITIVITY ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED USING 'ONE-STUDY-REMOVED' ANALYSIS. SUBGROUP ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED FOR DIFFERENT YOGA AND CONTROL GROUP TYPES, INCLUDING MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION VERSUS NON-MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION BASED INTERVENTIONS, DIFFERENT POPULATIONS, LENGTH OF INTERVENTION, AND METHOD OF DATA ANALYSIS. A RANDOM-EFFECTS MODEL WAS USED IN ALL ANALYSES. RESULTS: FORTY TWO STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IN THE META-ANALYSIS. INTERVENTIONS THAT INCLUDED YOGA ASANAS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED EVENING CORTISOL, WAKING CORTISOL, AMBULATORY SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE, RESTING HEART RATE, HIGH FREQUENCY HEART RATE VARIABILITY, FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE, CHOLESTEROL AND LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN, COMPARED TO ACTIVE CONTROL. HOWEVER, THE REPORTED INTERVENTIONS WERE HETEROGENEOUS. CONCLUSIONS: PRACTICES THAT INCLUDE YOGA ASANAS APPEAR TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED REGULATION OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-ADRENAL SYSTEM IN VARIOUS POPULATIONS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
16 1803  26 PREVALENCE OF DIABETES AND ITS DETERMINANTS IN THE YOUNG ADULTS INDIAN POPULATION-CALL FOR YOGA INTERVENTION. BACKGROUND: THE YOUNG INDIAN POPULATION, WHICH CONSTITUTES 65% OF THE COUNTRY, IS FAST ADAPTING TO A NEW LIFESTYLE, WHICH WAS NOT KNOWN EARLIER. THEY ARE AT A HIGH RISK OF THE INCREASING BURDEN OF DIABETES AND ASSOCIATED COMPLICATIONS. THE NEW EVOLVING LIFESTYLE IS NOT ONLY AFFECTING PEOPLE'S HEALTH BUT ALSO MOUNTING THE MONETARY BURDEN ON A DEVELOPING COUNTRY SUCH AS INDIA. AIM: WE AIMED TO COLLECT INFORMATION REGARDING THE PREVALENCE OF RISK OF DIABETES IN YOUNG ADULTS (<35 YEARS) IN THE 29 MOST POPULOUS STATES AND UNION TERRITORIES (7 ZONES) OF INDIA, USING A VALIDATED QUESTIONNAIRE. METHODS: A USER-FRIENDLY QUESTIONNAIRE-BASED SURVEY USING A MOBILE APPLICATION WAS CONDUCTED ON ALL ADULTS IN THE 29 MOST POPULOUS STATES/UNION TERRITORIES OF INDIA, AFTER OBTAINING ETHICAL CLEARANCE FOR THE STUDY. HERE, WE REPORT THE ESTIMATION OF THE PREVALENCE OF THE RISK OF DIABETES AND SELF-REPORTED DIABETES ON 58,821 YOUNG INDIVIDUALS BELOW THE AGE OF 35 YEARS. RISK FOR DIABETES WAS ASSESSED USING A STANDARDIZED INSTRUMENT, THE INDIAN DIABETES RISK SCORE (IDRS), THAT HAS 4 FACTORS (AGE, FAMILY HISTORY OF DIABETES, WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE, AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY). SPEARMAN'S CORRELATION COEFFICIENT WAS USED TO CHECK THE CORRELATIONS. RESULTS: THE PREVALENCE OF HIGH (IDRS SCORE > 60), MODERATE (IDRS SCORE 30-50), AND LOW (IDRS < 30) DIABETES RISK IN YOUNG ADULTS (<35 YEARS) WAS 10.2%, 33.1%, AND 56.7%, RESPECTIVELY. THOSE WITH HIGH-RISK SCORES WERE HIGHEST (14.4%) IN THE JAMMU ZONE AND LOWEST (4.1%) IN THE CENTRAL ZONE. THE PREVALENCE OF SELF-REPORTED DIABETES WAS 1.8% WITH A SMALL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEN (1.7%) AND WOMEN (1.9%), AND THE HIGHEST (8.4%) IN THOSE WITH A PARENTAL HISTORY OF DIABETES. THE SOUTH ZONE HAD THE HIGHEST (2.5%), AND THE NORTH WEST ZONE HAD THE LOWEST (4.4%) PREVALENCE. CONCLUSIONS: INDIAN YOUTH ARE AT HIGH RISK FOR DIABETES, WHICH CALLS FOR AN URGENT ACTION PLAN THROUGH INTENSIVE EFFORTS TO PROMOTE LIFESTYLE BEHAVIOR MODIFICATIONS DURING THE PANDEMICS OF BOTH COMMUNICABLE AND NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
17  914  23 EFFECTIVENESS OF PILATES AND YOGA TO IMPROVE BONE DENSITY IN ADULT WOMEN: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: THE AGEING POPULATION BRINGS ABOUT THE APPEARANCE OF AGE-RELATED HEALTH DISORDERS, SUCH AS OSTEOPOROSIS OR OSTEOPENIA. THESE DISORDERS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH FRAGILITY FRACTURES. THE IMPACT IS GREATER AMONG POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN DUE TO AN ACCELERATION OF BONE MINERAL DENSITY (BMD) LOSS. OBJECTIVE: TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PILATES OR YOGA ON BMD IN ADULT WOMEN. METHODS: FIVE ELECTRONICS DATABASES WERE SEARCHED UP TO APRIL 2021. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS), NON-RCTS AND PRE-POST STUDIES WERE INCLUDED. THE MAIN OUTCOME WAS BMD. RISK OF BIAS WAS EVALUATED USING THE COCHRANE RISK OF BIAS TOOL. A RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL WAS USED TO POOL DATA FROM PRIMARY STUDIES. SUBGROUP ANALYSES BASED ON THE TYPE OF EXERCISE WERE CONDUCTED. RESULTS: ELEVEN STUDIES INCLUDING 591 PARTICIPANTS AGED BETWEEN 45 AND 78 YEARS WERE INCLUDED. THE MEAN LENGTH OF THE INTERVENTIONS RANGED FROM 12 TO 32 WEEKS, AND TWO STUDIES WERE PERFORMED FOR A PERIOD OF AT LEAST ONE YEAR. THE POOLED EFFECT SIZE FOR THE EFFECT OF THE INTERVENTION (PILATES/YOGA) VS THE CONTROL GROUP WAS 0.07 (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI]: -0.05 TO 0.19; I2 = 0.0%), AND 0.10 (95% CI: 0.01 TO 0.18; I2 = 18.4%) FOR THE SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF THE PRE-POST INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: DESPITE OF THE NON-SIGNIFICANT RESULTS, THE BMD MAINTENANCE IN THE POSTMENOPAUSAL POPULATION, WHEN BMD DETRIMENTAL IS EXPECTED, COULD BE UNDERSTOOD AS A POSITIVE RESULT ADDED TO THE BENEFICIAL IMPACT OF PILATES-YOGA IN MULTIPLE FRACTURE RISK FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, STRENGTH AND BALANCE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
18 2035  23 TELE-YOGA FOR CHRONIC PAIN: CURRENT STATUS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS. PAIN IS A PERVASIVE, DEBILITATING DISORDER THAT IS RESISTANT TO LONG-TERM PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS. ALTHOUGH PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPIES SUCH AS COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY DEMONSTRATE MODERATE EFFICACY, MANY INDIVIDUALS CONTINUE TO HAVE ONGOING DIFFICULTIES FOLLOWING TREATMENT. THERE IS A CURRENT TREND TO ESTABLISH COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH INTERVENTIONS FOR CHRONIC PAIN, FOR WHICH YOGA HAS BEEN FOUND TO HAVE EXCITING POTENTIAL. NEVERTHELESS, AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION WITHIN THE FIELD IS ACCESSIBILITY TO ADEQUATE CARE.

19 2130  23 THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA TO PREVENT DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2: A PROTOCOL FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM) IS BECOMING A LEADING PROBLEM WORLDWIDE. EMERGING REPORTS REVEAL ALARMING EVIDENCE OF INCREASING PREVALENCE OF T2DM THAT HAS REACHED PANDEMIC LEVELS. DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT INCIDENCE, THERE ARE LIMITED RELIABLE DATA RESOURCES AND COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PEOPLE WHO ARE A PREDIABETIC OR HIGH RISK FOR DEVELOPING T2DM. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROTOCOL IS TO CONDUCT A FULL-SCALE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSES ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PEOPLE WHO ARE PREDIABETES OR HIGH RISK OF DEVELOPING T2DM. METHODS: THE ARTICLES ENROLLED IN THE STUDY WILL BE RETRIEVED FROM THE ONLINE DATABASES BETWEEN 2002 AND THE DATE THE SEARCHES ARE EXECUTED. THE SEARCHES WILL BE REPEATED JUST BEFORE THE FINAL ANALYSES AND FURTHER RELEVANT STUDIES FOR INCLUSION. WE WILL CONDUCT A BIBLIOGRAPHIC SEARCH IN DATABASES: MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, COCHRANE LIBRARY, EBSCO, AND INDMED USING KEYWORDS INCLUDING PREDIABETES STATE, HIGH RISK FOR DIABETES, METABOLIC SYNDROME, AND YOGA. A DEFINED SEARCH STRATEGY WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ALONG WITH SELECTION CRITERIA TO OBTAIN FULL-TEXT ARTICLES OF RELEVANT STUDIES. THIS STUDY PROTOCOL WAS PREPARED ACCORDING TO THE PREFERRED REPORTING ITEMS FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND META-ANALYSIS FOR PROTOCOLS 2015 GUIDELINES. THERE WILL BE NO LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL BE BASED ON PUBLISHED STUDIES AND PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ANONYMIZED DATA WITHOUT DIRECTLY INVOLVING HUMAN PARTICIPANTS AND THEREFORE REQUIRES NEITHER FORMAL HUMAN ETHICAL REVIEW NOR APPROVAL BY A HUMAN RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEE. WE PUBLISHED AN OUTLINE OF THE PROTOCOL IN THE INTERNATIONAL PROSPECTIVE REGISTER OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS (PROSPERO) IN 2018. WE PLAN TO DISSEMINATE THE FINDINGS OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS THROUGH PUBLICATION IN A PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL AND PRESENTATION AT RELEVANT CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS. IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE THE RESULTS OF THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WILL HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND PRACTICE. WE WILL PREPARE POLICYMAKER SUMMARY USING A VALIDATED FORMAT, DISSEMINATE THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA AND EMAIL DISCUSSION GROUPS.

20 2732  24 YOGA ON OUR MINDS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF YOGA FOR NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS. BACKGROUND: THE DEMAND FOR CLINICALLY EFFICACIOUS, SAFE, PATIENT ACCEPTABLE, AND COST-EFFECTIVE FORMS OF TREATMENT FOR MENTAL ILLNESS IS GROWING. SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED BENEFIT FROM YOGA IN SPECIFIC PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS AND A GENERAL SENSE OF WELL-BEING. OBJECTIVE: TO SYSTEMATICALLY EXAMINE THE EVIDENCE FOR EFFICACY OF YOGA IN THE TREATMENT OF SELECTED MAJOR PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS. METHODS: ELECTRONIC SEARCHES OF THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS AND THE STANDARD BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATABASES, MEDLINE, EMBASE, AND PSYCINFO, WERE PERFORMED THROUGH APRIL 2011 AND AN UPDATED IN JUNE 2011 USING THE KEYWORDS YOGA AND PSYCHIATRY OR DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY OR SCHIZOPHRENIA OR COGNITION OR MEMORY OR ATTENTION AND RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT). STUDIES WITH YOGA AS THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE AND ONE OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED TERMS AS THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE WERE INCLUDED AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA WERE APPLIED. RESULTS: THE SEARCH YIELDED A TOTAL OF 124 TRIALS, OF WHICH 16 MET RIGOROUS CRITERIA FOR THE FINAL REVIEW. GRADE B EVIDENCE SUPPORTING A POTENTIAL ACUTE BENEFIT FOR YOGA EXISTS IN DEPRESSION (FOUR RCTS), AS AN ADJUNCT TO PHARMACOTHERAPY IN SCHIZOPHRENIA (THREE RCTS), IN CHILDREN WITH ADHD (TWO RCTS), AND GRADE C EVIDENCE IN SLEEP COMPLAINTS (THREE RCTS). RCTS IN COGNITIVE DISORDERS AND EATING DISORDERS YIELDED CONFLICTING RESULTS. NO STUDIES LOOKED AT PRIMARY PREVENTION, RELAPSE PREVENTION, OR COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS VERSUS PHARMACOTHERAPY. CONCLUSION: THERE IS EMERGING EVIDENCE FROM RANDOMIZED TRIALS TO SUPPORT POPULAR BELIEFS ABOUT YOGA FOR DEPRESSION, SLEEP DISORDERS, AND AS AN AUGMENTATION THERAPY. LIMITATIONS OF LITERATURE INCLUDE INABILITY TO DO DOUBLE-BLIND STUDIES, MULTIPLICITY OF COMPARISONS WITHIN SMALL STUDIES, AND LACK OF REPLICATION. BIOMARKER AND NEUROIMAGING STUDIES, THOSE COMPARING YOGA WITH STANDARD PHARMACO- AND PSYCHOTHERAPIES, AND STUDIES OF LONG-TERM EFFICACY ARE NEEDED TO FULLY TRANSLATE THE PROMISE OF YOGA FOR ENHANCING MENTAL HEALTH.	2012

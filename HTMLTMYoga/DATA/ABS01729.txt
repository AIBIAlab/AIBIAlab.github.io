1 1729 151 PERSONALISED YOGA FOR BURNOUT AND TRAUMATIC STRESS IN JUNIOR DOCTORS. OBJECTIVES: JUNIOR DOCTORS ARE FREQUENTLY EXPOSED TO OCCUPATIONAL AND TRAUMATIC STRESS, SOMETIMES WITH TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES. MINDFULNESS-BASED AND FITNESS INTERVENTIONS ARE INCREASINGLY USED TO MITIGATE THIS, BUT HAVE NOT BEEN COMPARED.WE CONDUCTED A RANDOMISED, CONTROLLED PILOT TRIAL TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE INTERVENTIONS IN JUNIOR DOCTORS. METHODS: WE RANDOMISED PARTICIPANTS (N=21) TO WEEKLY 1-HOUR SESSIONS OF PERSONALISED, TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA (N=10), WITH A 4-HOUR WORKSHOP, AND EHEALTH HOMEWORK; OR GROUP-FORMAT FITNESS (N=8) IN AN EXISTING WELLNESS PROGRAMME, MDOK. BURNOUT, TRAUMATIC STRESS AND SUICIDALITY WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE AND 8 WEEKS. RESULTS: BOTH INTERVENTIONS REDUCED BURNOUT, AND YOGA INCREASED COMPASSION SATISFACTION WITHIN GROUP ON THE PROFESSIONAL QUALITY OF LIFE SCALE, WITHOUT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS ON THIS MEASURE.PERSONALISED YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED DEPERSONALISATION (Z=-1.99, P=0.05) COMPARED WITH GROUP FITNESS ON THE MASLACH BURNOUT INVENTORY (MBI-HSS (MP)) AND SHOWED GREATER FLEXIBILITY CHANGES. BOTH INTERVENTIONS INCREASED MBI PERSONAL ACCOMPLISHMENT, WITH NO CHANGES IN OTHER SELF-REPORT PSYCHOLOGICAL OR PHYSIOLOGICAL METRICS, INCLUDING BREATH-COUNTING.PARTICIPANTS DOING ONE-TO-ONE YOGA RATED IT MORE HIGHLY OVERALL (P=0.02) THAN GROUP FITNESS, AND REPORTED IT COMPARATIVELY MORE BENEFICIAL FOR MENTAL (P=0.01) AND PHYSICAL HEALTH (P=0.05). FACE-TO-FACE WEEKLY SESSIONS WERE 100% ATTENDED IN YOGA, BUT ONLY 45% IN FITNESS. CONCLUSION: IN THIS PILOT TRIAL, BOTH YOGA AND FITNESS IMPROVED BURNOUT, BUT TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA REDUCED DEPERSONALISATION IN JUNIOR DOCTORS MORE THAN GROUP-FORMAT FITNESS. ONE-TO-ONE YOGA WAS BETTER ADHERED THAN FITNESS, BUT WAS MORE RESOURCE INTENSIVE. JUNIOR DOCTORS NEED LARGER-SCALE COMPARATIVE RESEARCH OF THE EFFECTIVENESS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF INDIVIDUAL, ORGANISATIONAL AND SYSTEMIC MENTAL HEALTH INTERVENTIONS.

2 2618  34 YOGA FOR SELF-CARE AND BURNOUT PREVENTION AMONG NURSES. THE PROMOTION OF SELF-CARE AND THE PREVENTION OF BURNOUT AMONG NURSES IS A PUBLIC HEALTH PRIORITY. EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE EFFICACY OF YOGA TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES, BUT FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE INFLUENCE OF YOGA ON NURSE-SPECIFIC OUTCOMES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT-LEVEL RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA TO IMPROVE SELF-CARE AND REDUCE BURNOUT AMONG NURSES. COMPARED WITH CONTROLS (N = 20), YOGA PARTICIPANTS (N = 20) REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SELF-CARE AS WELL AS LESS EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION AND DEPERSONALIZATION UPON COMPLETION OF AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. ALTHOUGH THE CONTROL GROUP DEMONSTRATED NO CHANGE THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE STUDY, THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SCORES FROM PRE- TO POST-INTERVENTION FOR SELF-CARE (P < .001), MINDFULNESS (P = .028), EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION (P = .008), AND DEPERSONALIZATION (P = .007) OUTCOMES. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE ARE DISCUSSED.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
3 2162  43 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND MINDFUL MEDITATION ON ELDERLY CARE WORKER'S BURNOUT: A CONSORT-COMPLIANT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF MINDFUL MEDITATION AND YOGA ON REDUCING BURNOUT AND STRESS IN CARE WORKERS WHO ASSIST ELDERLY INDIVIDUALS. KNOWING HOW TO REDUCE BURNOUT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT OF CARE WORKERS IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE QUALITY OF CLIENT CARE, WORKER PRODUCTIVITY, AND JOB TURNOVER. PATIENTS AND METHODS: THE PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED 44 CARE WORKERS WHO WORKED FOR ELDERLY CARE FACILITIES IN RURAL FUKUOKA. THEY WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THREE INTERVENTION GROUPS: CONTROL, YOGA, OR MINDFULNESS. IN THE YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP, A CERTIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTOR TAUGHT A 60-MINUTE YOGA SESSION EACH WEEK FOR SIX WEEKS. IN THE MINDFULNESS GROUP, AN EXPERIENCED MEDICAL DOCTOR INSTRUCTED A MINDFUL MEDITATION PROGRAM FOR THE SAME LENGTH. PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO COMPLETE THE JAPANESE BURNOUT SCALE (JBS), AND THE RESEARCH TEAM COLLECTED THE LEVEL OF ALPHA-AMYLASE IN SALIVA USING NIPRO: T-110-N PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTIONS. RESULTS: MANOVA WAS PERFORMED WITH EACH INTERVENTION (CONTROL, YOGA, MINDFULNESS) AS THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE ON THE THREE SUBSCALES OF THE JBS (EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION, DEPERSONALIZATION, AND PERSONAL ACHIEVEMENT) AND A BIOMARKER OF STRESS LEVEL (ALPHA-AMYLASE). THE RESULTS INDICATED A SIGNIFICANT MAIN EFFECT OF INTERVENTIONS, AND A FOLLOW-UP ANOVA SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF INTERVENTIONS ON EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION AND PERSONAL ACHIEVEMENT. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT PRACTICING MINDFUL MEDITATION OR YOGA FOR 60 MINUTES ONCE A WEEK FOR SIX WEEKS CAN REDUCE CARE WORKERS' BURNOUT. THIS STUDY WAS NOTABLE BECAUSE THE BIOMARKER OF STRESS ALSO IMPROVED. IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED AND ENCOURAGED THAT INSTITUTIONS CARING FOR THE ELDERLY POPULATION PROVIDE MINDFUL MEDITATION OR YOGA INTERVENTION TO REDUCE BURNOUT, WHICH BENEFITS NOT ONLY CARE WORKERS BUT ALSO THEIR CLIENTS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
4 1620  49 MINDFUL2WORK: EFFECTS OF COMBINED PHYSICAL EXERCISE, YOGA, AND MINDFULNESS MEDITATIONS FOR STRESS RELIEVE IN EMPLOYEES. A PROOF OF CONCEPT STUDY. WORK-RELATED STRESS AND ASSOCIATED ILLNESS AND BURNOUT IS RISING IN WESTERN SOCIETY, WITH NOW AS MUCH AS ALMOST A QUARTER OF EUROPEAN AND HALF OF USA'S EMPLOYEES ESTIMATED TO BE AT THE POINT OF BURNOUT. MINDFULNESS MEDITATION, YOGA, AND PHYSICAL EXERCISE HAVE ALL SHOWN BENEFICIAL EFFECTS FOR WORK-RELATED STRESS AND ILLNESS. THIS PROOF OF CONCEPT STUDY ASSESSED THE FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND PRELIMINARY EFFECTS OF THE NEWLY DEVELOPED MINDFUL2WORK TRAINING, A COMBINATION OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE, RESTORATIVE YOGA, AND MINDFULNESS MEDITATIONS, DELIVERED IN SIX WEEKLY GROUP SESSIONS PLUS A FOLLOW-UP SESSION. PARTICIPANTS (N = 26, FOUR MALES), REFERRED BY COMPANY DOCTORS WITH (WORK-RELATED) STRESS AND BURNOUT COMPLAINTS, COMPLETED MEASUREMENTS PRE AND POST THE INTERVENTION, AS WELL AS AT 6-WEEK (FU1) AND 6-MONTH (FU2) FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS SHOWED VERY HIGH FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF THE MINDFUL2WORK TRAINING. THE TRAINING AND TRAINERS WERE RATED WITH AN 8.1 AND 8.4 ON A 1-10 SCALE, RESPECTIVELY, AND TRAINING DROPOUT RATE WAS ZERO. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WITH (VERY) LARGE EFFECT SIZES WERE DEMONSTRATED FOR THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES OF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WORKABILITY, AND FOR ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, STRESS, SLEEP QUALITY, POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECT, WHICH REMAINED (VERY) LARGE AND MOSTLY INCREASED FURTHER OVER TIME. RISK FOR LONG-TERM DROPOUT FROM WORK (CHECKLIST INDIVIDUAL STRENGTH [CIS]) WAS 92 % AT PRE-TEST, REDUCED TO 67 % AT POST-TEST, TO 44 % AT FU1, AND 35 % AT FU2, WHEREAS EMPLOYEES WORKED (RTWI) 65 % OF THEIR CONTRACT HOURS PER WEEK AT PRE-TEST, WHICH INCREASED TO 73 % AT POST-TEST, 81 % AT FU1 AND 93 % AT FU2. INTENSITY OF HOME PRACTICE OR NUMBER OF ATTENDED SESSIONS WERE NOT RELATED TO TRAINING EFFECTS. TO CONCLUDE, THE NEWLY DEVELOPED MINDFUL2WORK TRAINING SEEMS VERY FEASIBLE, AND ACCEPTABLE, AND ALTHOUGH NO CONTROL GROUP WAS INCLUDED, THE LARGE EFFECTS OF MINDFUL2WORK ARE HIGHLY PROMISING.	2017	
                                                                                                                                              
5 1341  53 HOW JUNIOR DOCTORS PERCEIVE PERSONALISED YOGA AND GROUP EXERCISE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF OCCUPATIONAL AND TRAUMATIC STRESSORS. OBJECTIVES: JUNIOR DOCTORS ARE EXPOSED TO OCCUPATIONAL AND TRAUMATIC STRESSORS, SOME OF WHICH ARE INHERENT TO MEDICINE. THIS CAN RESULT IN BURNOUT, MENTAL ILL-HEALTH AND SUICIDE. WITHIN A CROSSOVER PILOT STUDY COMPARING PERSONALISED, TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA TO GROUP-FORMAT EXERCISE, QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED TO UNDERSTAND THE EXPERIENCE OF JUNIOR DOCTORS AND WHETHER SUCH INTERVENTIONS WERE PERCEIVED TO HELP MANAGE THESE STRESSORS. METHODS: TWENTY-ONE DOCTORS, 76% FEMALE, WERE ORDER-RANDOMISED TO CONSECUTIVE 8-WEEK YOGA AND EXERCISE PROGRAMMES. FIFTY-TWO INTERVIEWS WERE RECORDED BEFORE AND AFTER EACH PROGRAMME. RESULTS: MANY PARTICIPANTS REPORTED BEING TIME POOR, SLEEP-AFFECTED, FREQUENTLY STRESSED AND OCCASIONALLY IN PHYSICAL PAIN/DISTRESS. MAJOR STRESSOR THEMES WERE WORKPLACE INCIVILITY, DEATH/HUMAN SUFFERING AND SHIFT WORK WITH MINIMAL SUPPORT. BOTH INTERVENTIONS WERE ACCEPTABLE FOR DIFFERENT REASONS. PERSONALISED YOGA OFFERED A THERAPEUTIC ALLIANCE, TIME TO CHECK-IN AND REDUCED ANXIETY/RUMINATION. GROUP EXERCISE PROVIDED ENERGY AND SOCIAL CONNECTION. ONE PARTICIPANT FOUND YOGA BENEFICIAL FOLLOWING AN ACUTE WORKPLACE TRAUMA: 'IT WAS REALLY EYE OPENING HOW MUCH I FELT MY BODY JUST NEEDED TO DETOX ... I WOULDN'T HAVE GONE TO A GROUP FITNESS THE NEXT DAY ... I JUST WANTED TO RELAX AND BREATHE ...WE STILL HAD A BIG DEBRIEF WHICH WAS GREAT ... (BUT) I ALMOST FELT LIKE ... I DEALT WITH IT PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY BEFORE GOING INTO IT (P20).' CONCLUSION: JUNIOR DOCTORS FOUND BOTH INTERVENTIONS USEFUL FOR STRESS MANAGEMENT ADJUNCTIVE TO OTHER ORGANISATIONAL PROGRAMMES THOUGH FOR DIFFERENT AND COMPLEMENTARY REASONS, POSSIBLY RELATED TO DELIVERY MODE. PERSONALISED, TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA PROVIDED A CONFIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC ALLIANCE WHEREAS GROUP EXERCISE OFFERED SOCIAL CONNECTION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
6 1230  45 FEASIBILITY AND OUTCOME OF AN ONLINE STREAMED YOGA INTERVENTION ON STRESS AND WELLBEING OF PEOPLE WORKING FROM HOME DURING COVID-19. BACKGROUND: THE OUTBREAK OF COVID-19 AND ITS ASSOCIATED MEASURES HAS RESULTED IN A SIZEABLE WORKING POPULATION TRANSITIONING TO WORKING FROM HOME (WFH), BRINGING ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES, AND INCREASING WORK-RELATED STRESS. RESEARCH HAS INDICATED THAT YOGA HAS PROMISING POTENTIAL IN REDUCING STRESS IN THE WORKPLACE. HOWEVER, THERE ARE VERY FEW STUDIES EXPLORING THE IMPACT OF ONLINE STREAMED YOGA ON STRESS MANAGEMENT FOR PEOPLE-WFH. OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY AND OUTCOME OF AN ONLINE STREAMED YOGA INTERVENTION ON STRESS AND WELLBEING OF PEOPLE-WFH DURING COVID-19. METHODS: A SIX-WEEK PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) YOGA INTERVENTION WAS DESIGNED WITH YOGA (N = 26) AND A WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 26). A MIXED TWO-WAY ANOVA WAS USED TO ASSESS CHANGES IN STANDARDISED OUTCOME MEASURES AT BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION. LIKERT AND OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS ASSESSED ENJOYMENT, ACCEPTABILITY AND PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM, WHICH WERE ANALYSED THEMATICALLY. RESULTS: COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL, THE YOGA GROUP REPORTED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN PERCEIVED STRESS, MENTAL WELLBEING, DEPRESSION AND COPING SELF-EFFICACY, BUT NOT STRESS AND ANXIETY. PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCED PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS AND REPORTED HIGH ACCEPTABILITY AND ENJOYMENT OF THE INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: AN ONLINE YOGA INTERVENTION CAN HELP PEOPLE WFH MANAGE STRESS AND ENHANCE WELLBEING AND COPING ABILITIES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
7 1830  44 PSYCHOLOGICAL FLEXIBILITY AND SET-SHIFTING AMONG VETERANS PARTICIPATING IN A YOGA PROGRAM: A PILOT STUDY. INTRODUCTION: TRAUMA-FOCUSED PSYCHOTHERAPIES DO NOT MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL VETERANS. YOGA SHOWS SOME POTENTIAL IN REDUCING STRESS AND PERHAPS EVEN PTSD IN VETERANS, ALTHOUGH LITTLE IS UNDERSTOOD ABOUT THE MECHANISMS OF ACTION. THIS STUDY IDENTIFIES PRELIMINARY CORRELATES OF CHANGE IN PTSD AND PERCEIVED STRESS FOR VETERANS PARTICIPATING IN YOGA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: NINE VETERANS (SEVEN MALES AND TWO FEMALES) WERE RECRUITED FROM AN EXISTING CLINICAL YOGA PROGRAM AND OBSERVED OVER 16 WK. SEVERITY OF PTSD SYMPTOMS (PCL-5) AND PERCEIVED STRESS (PSS-10) WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE AND WEEKS 4, 6, 8, AND 16. PSYCHOLOGICAL FLEXIBILITY (AAQ-II) AND SET-SHIFTING (RATIO OF TRAIL MAKING TEST A TO B) WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE AND AT WEEK 6. SUBJECTS ATTENDED YOGA SESSIONS FREELY, RANGING FROM 1 TO 23 CLASSES OVER THE 16 WEEKS. THE STANFORD UNIVERSITY INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD APPROVED THIS RESEARCH PROTOCOL. RESULTS: SELF-REPORTED PTSD SYMPTOMS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED WHILE PERCEIVED STRESS DID NOT. LOWER BASELINE SET-SHIFTING PREDICTED GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN PTSD BETWEEN BASELINE AND 4 WEEKS; EARLY IMPROVEMENTS IN SET-SHIFTING PREDICTED OVERALL REDUCTION IN PTSD. GREATER PSYCHOLOGICAL FLEXIBILITY WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER PTSD AND PERCEIVED STRESS; MORE YOGA PRACTICE, BEFORE AND DURING THE STUDY, WAS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER PSYCHOLOGICAL FLEXIBILITY. OTHER PREDICTORS WERE NOT SUPPORTED. CONCLUSIONS: IN A SMALL UNCONTROLLED SAMPLE, PSYCHOLOGICAL FLEXIBILITY AND SET-SHIFTING PREDICTED CHANGES IN PTSD SYMPTOMS IN VETERANS PARTICIPATING IN A CLINICAL YOGA PROGRAM, WHICH SUPPORTS FINDINGS FROM PRIOR RESEARCH. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD INCLUDE AN ACTIVE COMPARISON GROUP AND RECORD FREQUENCY OF YOGA PRACTICED OUTSIDE FORMAL SESSIONS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
8  719  38 EFFECT OF IYENGAR YOGA ON MENTAL HEALTH OF INCARCERATED WOMEN: A FEASIBILITY STUDY. BACKGROUND: INCARCERATED WOMEN SHARE A DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN OF MENTAL ILLNESS. ALTHOUGH PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO WOMEN IN PRISON, ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT MODALITIES, SUCH AS IYENGAR YOGA, MAY INCREASE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING. OBJECTIVES: THE PURPOSES OF THIS STUDY WERE (A) TO ADDRESS THE FEASIBILITY OF PROVIDING A GENDER-RESPONSIVE EXERCISE INTERVENTION WITHIN A CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION AND (B) TO OBSERVE THE EFFECT OF A GROUP-FORMAT IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM THAT MET TWO SESSIONS A WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS ON LEVELS OF DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS, ANXIETY SYMPTOMS, AND PERCEIVED STRESS AMONG INCARCERATED WOMEN. METHODS: A REPEATED MEASURES DESIGN, IN WHICH EACH PARTICIPANT SERVED AS HER OWN CONTROL, WAS USED. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THREE SELF-ADMINISTERED INSTRUMENTS: THE BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY, THE BECK ANXIETY INVENTORY, AND THE PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE BEFORE TREATMENT (BASELINE) AND DURING TREATMENT (WEEKS 4, 8, AND 12). LINEAR MIXED EFFECTS MODELS WERE USED TO EXAMINE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN MENTAL HEALTH MEASURES OVER TIME, TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ALL AVAILABLE DATA. RESULTS: ALTHOUGH 21 WOMEN INITIALLY PARTICIPATED IN THE INTERVENTION, 6 WOMEN COMPLETED THE 12-WEEK INTERVENTION. A SIGNIFICANT LINEAR DECREASE WAS DEMONSTRATED IN SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION OVER TIME, WITH MEAN VALUES CHANGING FROM 24.90 AT BASELINE TO 5.67 AT WEEK 12. THERE WAS A MARGINALLY SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN ANXIETY OVER TIME (12.00 AT BASELINE TO 7.33 AT WEEK 12) AND A NONLINEAR CHANGE IN STRESS OVER TIME, WITH DECREASES FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 4 AND SUBSEQUENT INCREASES TO WEEK 12. DISCUSSION: WOMEN WHO PARTICIPATED IN THIS PROGRAM EXPERIENCED FEWER SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY OVER TIME. FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY MAY BE USED TO IMPROVE FUTURE INTERVENTIONS FOCUSING ON THE HEALTH OUTCOMES OF INCARCERATED WOMEN.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
9 1367  33 IMPACT OF A MINDFULNESS-BASED, WORKPLACE GROUP YOGA INTERVENTION ON BURNOUT, SELF-CARE, AND COMPASSION IN HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER A WORKPLACE, GROUP MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION COULD HELP MANAGE BURNOUT AND IMPROVE WELLBEING AMONG HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 43 HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS PARTICIPATED IN 8-WEEK SUPERVISED WORKPLACE, GROUP MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA ACTIVITIES. THE AUTHORS USED A SINGLE-SAMPLE, PRE-POST DESIGN. AT TWO POINTS IN TIME (BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION), PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED A SET OF ONLINE MEASURES ASSESSING BURNOUT, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, STRESS, RESILIENCE, AND COMPASSION. THE AUTHORS USED LINEAR MIXED MODEL ANALYSIS TO ASSESS CHANGES IN OUTCOME MEASURES. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS HAD IMPROVEMENTS AFTER THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION. AT POSTINTERVENTION, THEY HAD SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER SCORES ON PERSONAL ACCOMPLISHMENT, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, STRESS, PERCEIVED RESILIENCE, AND COMPASSION. PARTICIPANTS HAD A POSITIVE PERCEPTION OF THE YOGA INTERVENTION. CONCLUSION: GROUP MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA PROGRAM MAY BE CONVENIENT AND LOW-COST APPROACH TO SUPPORT HEALTH AND WELLBEING AMONG HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
10 2127  44 THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF WELL-BEING AND RESILIENCE TO STRESS IN THE WORKPLACE. OBJECTIVES: RECENT RESEARCH HAS INDICATED CONCERN FOR THE DEGREE OF STRESS AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING AMONG UNIVERSITY STAFF. THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN ENHANCING EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING AND RESILIENCE TO STRESS AMONG UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES. METHODS: IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL AT A BRITISH UNIVERSITY, WE RECRUITED 48 EMPLOYEES AND RANDOMIZED THEM INTO EITHER A YOGA OR A WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP. THE YOGA GROUP WAS OFFERED SIX WEEKS OF DRU YOGA, COMPRISING ONE 60-MINUTE CLASS PER WEEK. THESE CLASSES WERE OFFERED BY A CERTIFIED DRU YOGA INSTRUCTOR AT LUNCHTIME FROM JANUARY-MARCH 2008. THE WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED NO INTERVENTION DURING THIS SIX-WEEK STUDY. BASELINE AND END-PROGRAM MEASUREMENTS OF SELF-REPORTED MOOD AND WELL-BEING WERE SELF-ASSESSED WITH THE PROFILE OF MOOD STATES - BIPOLAR (POMS-BI) AND THE INVENTORY OF POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL ATTITUDES (IPPA). RESULTS: THIS SIX-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED POMS-BI AND IPPA SCORES FOR THE YOGA COMPARED TO THE WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP FOR SEVEN OF EIGHT MEASURES OF MOOD AND WELL-BEING. IN COMPARISON TO THE WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP AT BASELINE AND THE END OF THE PROGRAM, THE YOGA GROUP REPORTED MARKED IMPROVEMENTS IN FEELINGS OF CLEAR-MINDEDNESS, COMPOSURE, ELATION, ENERGY, AND CONFIDENCE. IN ADDITION, THE YOGA GROUP REPORTED INCREASED LIFE PURPOSE AND SATISFACTION, AND FEELINGS OF GREATER SELF-CONFIDENCE DURING STRESSFUL SITUATIONS. CONCLUSION: THESE RESULTS SHOW THAT EVEN A SHORT PROGRAM OF YOGA IS EFFECTIVE FOR ENHANCING EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING AND RESILIENCE TO STRESS IN THE WORKPLACE. WE SUGGEST THAT EMPLOYERS SHOULD CONSIDER OFFERING YOGA CLASSES TO THEIR EMPLOYEES.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
11 2495  27 YOGA AS PALLIATION IN WOMEN WITH ADVANCED CANCER: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE PALLIATIVE POTENTIAL OF HOME-BASED YOGA SESSIONS PROVIDED TO WOMEN WITH ADVANCED CANCER. METHOD: PERSONALISED 45-MINUTE YOGA SESSIONS WERE OFFERED TO THREE WOMEN WITH ADVANCED CANCER BY AN EXPERIENCED YOGA TEACHER. EACH WOMAN TOOK PART IN A ONE-TO-ONE INTERVIEW AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE YOGA PROGRAMME AND WAS ASKED TO DESCRIBE HER EXPERIENCES OF THE PROGRAMME'S IMPACT. RESULTS: THE PERSONALISED NATURE OF THE YOGA SESSIONS RESULTED IN SIMILAR POSITIVE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL EFFECTS COMPARABLE TO THOSE DEMONSTRATED IN OTHER STUDIES WITH CANCER PATIENTS. PARTICIPANTS DESCRIBED PHYSICAL, MENTAL, AND EMOTIONAL BENEFITS AS WELL AS THE ALLEVIATION OF ILLNESS IMPACTS. THE ENHANCEMENT OF MIND-BODY AND BODY-SPIRIT CONNECTIONS WERE ALSO NOTED. CONCLUSION: PERSONALISED HOME-BASED YOGA PROGRAMMES FOR PEOPLE WITH ADVANCED CANCER MAY PRODUCE SIMILAR BENEFITS, INCLUDING PALLIATION, AS THOSE INSTITUTIONALLY-BASED PROGRAMMES FOR PEOPLE WITH NON-ADVANCED CANCER.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
12 1174  54 EVALUATION OF A YOGA-BASED MIND-BODY INTERVENTION FOR RESIDENT PHYSICIANS: A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS (MBIS) HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL INTERVENTIONS FOR MITIGATING PHYSICIAN BURNOUT, BUT THERE ARE NO CONTROLLED STUDIES OF YOGA-BASED MBIS IN RESIDENT PHYSICIANS. WE ASSESSED THE FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA-BASED MBI CALLED RISE (RESILIENCE, INTEGRATION, SELF-AWARENESS, ENGAGEMENT) FOR RESIDENTS AMONG MULTIPLE SPECIALTIES AND ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A WAITLIST CONTROLLED RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL OF THE RISE PROGRAM WITH RESIDENTS FROM MULTIPLE SPECIALTY DEPARTMENTS AT THREE ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS. THE RISE PROGRAM CONSISTED OF SIX WEEKLY SESSIONS WITH SUGGESTED HOME PRACTICE. FEASIBILITY WAS ASSESSED ACROSS SIX DOMAINS: DEMAND, IMPLEMENTATION, PRACTICALITY, ACCEPTABILITY, ADAPTATION, AND INTEGRATION. SELF-REPORTED MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE, POST-PROGRAM, AND TWO-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: AMONG 2,000 RESIDENTS CONTACTED, 75 WERE ASSESSED FOR ELIGIBILITY AND 56 WERE ENROLLED. FORTY-FOUR PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE STUDY AND WERE INCLUDED IN ANALYSIS. ON AVERAGE, PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED TWO OF SIX SESSIONS. FEASIBILITY OF IN-PERSON ATTENDANCE WAS RATED AS 28.9 (SD 25.6) ON A 100-POINT VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE. PARTICIPANTS RATED FEASIBILITY AS 69.2 (SD 26.0) IF THE PROGRAM WAS OFFERED VIRTUALLY. THOSE WHO RECEIVED RISE REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN MINDFULNESS, STRESS, BURNOUT, AND PHYSICIAN WELL-BEING FROM BASELINE TO POST-PROGRAM, WHICH WERE SUSTAINED AT TWO-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. CONCLUSION: THIS IS THE FIRST CONTROLLED STUDY OF A YOGA-BASED MBI IN RESIDENTS. WHILE THE PROGRAM WAS NOT FEASIBLE AS DELIVERED IN THIS PILOT STUDY, INITIAL ANALYSES SHOWED IMPROVEMENT IN MULTIPLE MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH. RESIDENTS REPORTED THAT VIRTUAL DELIVERY WOULD INCREASE FEASIBILITY.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
13 2812  45 YOGA TO REDUCE TRAUMA-RELATED DISTRESS AND EMOTIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL DIFFICULTIES AMONG CHILDREN LIVING IN ORPHANAGES IN HAITI: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVES: TO MEASURE TRAUMA-RELATED DISTRESS AND EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION (YI) IN REDUCING TRAUMA-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND EMOTIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL DIFFICULTIES (EBD) AMONG CHILDREN LIVING IN ORPHANAGES IN HAITI. DESIGN: CASE COMPARISON WITH RANDOM ASSIGNMENT TO YI OR AEROBIC DANCE CONTROL (DC) PLUS A NONRANDOMIZED WAIT-LIST CONTROL (WLC) GROUP. SETTING: TWO ORPHANAGES FOR CHILDREN IN HAITI. PARTICIPANTS: 76 CHILDREN AGE 7 TO 17 YEARS. INTERVENTION: THE YI INCLUDED YOGA POSTURES, BREATHING EXERCISES, AND MEDITATION. THE DC GROUP LEARNED A SERIES OF DANCE ROUTINES. THE WLC GROUP RECEIVED SERVICES AS USUAL IN THE INSTITUTIONAL SETTING. AFTER COMPLETION OF DATA COLLECTION, THE WLC GROUP RECEIVED BOTH YOGA AND DANCE CLASSES FOR 8 WEEKS. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE UCLA PTSD REACTION INDEX AND THE STRENGTHS AND DIFFICULTIES QUESTIONNAIRE WERE USED TO INDICATE TRAUMA-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND EBD, RESPECTIVELY. A WITHIN-SUBJECT ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED TO COMPARE PRE- AND POST-TREATMENT SCORES. A POST-TREATMENT YOGA EXPERIENCE QUESTIONNAIRE EVALUATED ACCEPTABILITY OF THE YI. RESULTS: ANALYSES OF VARIANCE REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT (F[2,28]=3.30; P=0.05) OF THE YI ON THE TRAUMA-RELATED SYMPTOM SCORES. REGRESSION ANALYSES SHOWED THAT PARTICIPATION IN EITHER 8 WEEKS OF YOGA OR DANCE CLASSES SUGGESTED A REDUCTION IN TRAUMA-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND EBD, ALTHOUGH THIS FINDING WAS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P>0.05). RESPONDENTS REPORTED SATISFACTION WITH THE YOGA PROGRAM AND IMPROVED WELL-BEING. CONCLUSIONS: CHILDREN WITH TRAUMA-RELATED DISTRESS SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS IN SYMPTOMS AFTER PARTICIPATION IN AN 8-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM COMPARED TO CONTROLS. YOGA IS A FEASIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE ACTIVITY WITH SELF-REPORTED BENEFITS TO CHILD MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO FURTHER EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA TO RELIEVE TRAUMA-RELATED DISTRESS AND PROMOTE WELL-BEING AMONG CHILDREN.	2015	
                                                                                                                
14 2673  32 YOGA IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE: A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY TO ACCESS THE EFFECTS ON QUALITY OF LIFE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. BACKGROUND: AND PURPOSE: YOGA IS GROWING IN POPULARITY, BUT ITS BENEFITS AND INTEGRATION INTO PRIMARY CARE REMAIN UNCERTAIN. HERE, WE DETERMINE YOGA EFFECTS ON QUALITY OF LIFE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, AND EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF INTRODUCING YOGA AT PRIMARY CARE LEVEL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS IS A PROSPECTIVE, LONGITUDINAL, QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY, WITH AN INTERVENTION (N=49) AND A CONTROL GROUP (N=37). YOGA GROUP UNDERWENT 24-WEEKS PROGRAM OF ONE-HOUR SESSIONS. OUR PRIMARY ENDPOINT WAS QUALITY OF LIFE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, AS WELL AS SATISFACTION LEVEL AND ADHERENCE RATE. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS REPORTED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ALL DOMAINS OF QUALITY OF LIFE AND A REDUCTION OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES PSYCHOLOGICAL QUALITY OF LIFE (P=0.046). CONCLUSION: YOGA IN PRIMARY CARE IS FEASIBLE, SAFE AND HAS A SATISFACTORY ADHERENCE, AS WELL AS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON PSYCHOLOGICAL QUALITY OF LIFE OF PARTICIPANTS.	2019

16 1701  39 PARTICIPATION IN A YOGA STUDY DECREASES STRESS AND DEPRESSION SCORES FOR INCARCERATED WOMEN. INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS EXHIBIT A HIGH INCIDENCE OF STRESS-RELATED DISORDERS, INCLUDING ADDICTION AND POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD), AS WELL AS THE ADDED STRESS OF CAPTIVITY. ACCESS TO STRESS-REDUCTION TOOLS IS LIMITED FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS. ONE POSSIBLE APPROACH MAY BE REGULAR STRUCTURED YOGA CLASSES. USING TWO APPROACHES, WE TESTED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A BRIEF, INTENSIVE YOGA INTERVENTION IN A POPULATION OF INCARCERATED WOMEN IN A COUNTY JAIL. THE FIRST APPROACH WAS AN EXAMINATION OF ARCHIVAL DATA COLLECTED AS PART OF A PROGRAM ANALYSIS. INDIVIDUALS SHOWED CONSIDERABLE REDUCTION IN SELF-REPORTED STRESS FOLLOWING A SINGLE YOGA SESSION. THE SECOND APPROACH WAS AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY USING A WEEK-LONG YOGA INTERVENTION. THIRTY-FOUR PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSIGNED TO EITHER THE YOGA OR CONTROL GROUP FOR THE FIRST WEEK. IN THE SECOND WEEK, THE CONDITIONS WERE REVERSED. PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSESSED WEEKLY, BEFORE AND AFTER INTERVENTION. BASELINE SCORES REVEALED HIGH RATES OF DEPRESSION, STRESS, AND EXPOSURE TO TRAUMATIC LIFE EVENTS COMPARED TO NORMATIVE DATA. STRESS AND DEPRESSION WERE ASSESSED USING THE PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE AND BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY, RESPECTIVELY. COMPARED TO CONTROLS, PARTICIPANTS REPORTED LESS DEPRESSION AFTER A WEEK OF DAILY YOGA SESSIONS. PERCEIVED STRESS DECLINED UNDER BOTH CONTROL AND YOGA CONDITIONS. DUE TO THE TRANSIENT NATURE OF THE JAIL INSTITUTION, IT IS IMPORTANT TO EXAMINE INTERVENTIONS THAT CAN BE PROVIDED ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS. ALTHOUGH THERE WERE LIMITATIONS IN THIS STUDY, THE RESULTS SUPPORT THE CONCLUSION THAT THE BRIEF YOGA INTERVENTION HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON PARTICIPANTS' WELL-BEING.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
17  893  23 EFFECT OF YOGA-BASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ON PERCEIVED STRESS, ANXIETY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN YOUNG ADULTS. PURPOSE: THIS STUDY, CONDUCTED AT A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY IN TURKEY, SOUGHT TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA-BASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ON PERCEIVED STRESS, ANXIETY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN YOUNG ADULTS. DESIGN AND METHODS: THIS STUDY WAS PLANNED AS A SEMIEXPERIMENTAL NONRANDOMIZED STUDY WITH A CONTROL GROUP. FINDINGS: YOGA-BASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY DECREASED THE PERCEIVED STRESS AND STATE ANXIETY LEVELS, BUT HAD NO EFFECT ON TRAIT ANXIETY LEVELS AND QUALITY OF LIFE. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOGA-BASED TREATMENT CAN BE INCLUDED IN NURSING INTERVENTIONS FOR REDUCING STRESS AND ANXIETY LEVELS IN YOUNG ADULTS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
18 2818  37 YOGA TRAINING IN JUNIOR PRIMARY SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN HAS AN IMPACT ON PHYSICAL SELF-PERCEPTIONS AND PROBLEM-RELATED BEHAVIOR. THE PRESENT PILOT STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA TRAINING, AS COMPARED TO PHYSICAL SKILL TRAINING, ON MOTOR AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION, PHYSICAL SELF-CONCEPT, AND ANXIETY-RELATED BEHAVIOR IN JUNIOR PRIMARY SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN. TWENTY-FOUR PARTICIPANTS WITH A MEAN AGE OF 8.4 (+/-1.4) YEARS COMPLETED EITHER YOGA OR PHYSICAL SKILL TRAINING TWICE A WEEK FOR 6 WEEKS OUTSIDE OF REGULAR SCHOOL CLASS TIME. BOTH FORMS OF TRAINING WERE DELIVERED IN AN INDIVIDUALIZED AND CHILD-ORIENTED MANNER. THE TYPE OF TRAINING DID NOT RESULT IN ANY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN MOVEMENT AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION OUTCOMES. IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SELF-CONCEPT, SIGNIFICANT GROUP DIFFERENCES WERE REVEALED ONLY FOR PERCEIVED MOVEMENT SPEED SUCH THAT YOGA TRAINING RESULTED IN PERCEPTIONS OF BEING SLOWER WHILE PHYSICAL SKILL TRAINING RESULTED IN PERCEPTIONS OF MOVING FASTER. ANALYSIS OF ANXIETY RELATED OUTCOMES REVEALED SIGNIFICANT GROUP EFFECTS ONLY FOR AVOIDANCE BEHAVIOR AND COPING STRATEGIES. AVOIDANCE BEHAVIOR INCREASED FOLLOWING YOGA TRAINING, BUT DECREASED FOLLOWING PHYSICAL SKILL TRAINING. IN ADDITION, FOLLOWING YOGA TRAINING, CHILDREN SHOWED AN INCREASED USE OF DIVERGENT COPING STRATEGIES WHEN FACING PROBLEMATIC SITUATIONS WHILE AFTER PHYSICAL SKILL TRAINING CHILDREN DEMONSTRATED A DECREASE IN USE OF DIVERGENT COPING STRATEGIES. CHANGES IN OVERALL PHYSICAL SELF-CONCEPT SCORES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH CHANGES IN AVOIDANCE BEHAVIOR FOLLOWING YOGA TRAINING. IN CONTRAST, FOLLOWING PHYSICAL SKILL TRAINING INCREASED PHYSICAL SELF-CONCEPT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH DECREASES IN AVOIDANCE BEHAVIOR. IN SUM, EXPOSURE TO YOGA OR PHYSICAL SKILL TRAINING APPEARS TO RESULT IN DISTINCT EFFECTS FOR SPECIFIC DOMAINS OF PHYSICAL SELF-CONCEPT AND ANXIETY-RELATED BEHAVIOR. FURTHER STUDIES WITH LARGER SAMPLES AND MORE RIGOROUS METHODOLOGIES ARE REQUIRED TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS REPORTED HERE. WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE STUDIES, WE ADDRESS POTENTIAL RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND SPECIFIC FEATURES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN A SAMPLE OF SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN.	2016

20 1085  38 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS, FATIGUE, MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN, AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG EMPLOYEES OF DIAMOND INDUSTRY: A NEW APPROACH IN EMPLOYEE WELLNESS. BACKGROUND: DIAMOND INDUSTRY EMPLOYEES OFTEN EXPERIENCE MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN, FATIGUE, AND STRESS, CONTRIBUTING TO A LOW QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). YOGA IS AN ANCIENT DISCIPLINE OF MIND-BODY PRACTICE YOGA HAS NUMEROUS HEALTH BENEFITS. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFICACY OF WORKPLACE YOGA IN IMPROVING STRESS, MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN, FATIGUE, AND QOL AMONG EMPLOYEES OF THE DIAMOND INDUSTRY. METHODS: ONE-HUNDRED SIXTY-SIX EMPLOYEES OF THE DIAMOND INDUSTRY BETWEEN THE AGES OF 20 AND 60 PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY. PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSIGNED TO EITHER YOGA (N = 84) OR WAITLIST (N = 82) GROUPS. THE YOGA GROUP RECEIVED ONE HOUR OF YOGA, FOUR DAYS A WEEK FOR THREE CONSECUTIVE MONTHS. PARTICIPANTS IN THE WAITLIST GROUP FOLLOWED THEIR DAILY ROUTINES. MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN, FATIGUE, STRESS, AND QOL WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND AFTER THREE MONTHS. RESULTS: ONE-HUNDRED FIFTY-FIVE EMPLOYEES COMPLETED THE STUDY. THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.05) IMPROVEMENT IN PAIN, PERCEIVED STRESS, FATIGUE, AND QOL DOMAINS AFTER THREE MONTHS COMPARED TO BASELINE. THE WAITLIST GROUP SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ANY OF THE MEASURES. IN THE POST SCORES COMPARISON BETWEEN THE GROUPS REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GROUPS. CONCLUSION: WORKPLACE YOGA FOUND TO BE A USEFUL, COST-EFFECTIVE AND FEASIBLE INTERVENTION IN IMPROVING STRESS, MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN, FATIGUES AND QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG EMPLOYEES OF THE DIAMOND INDUSTRY. YOGA MAY BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE WORKPLACE AS A WELLNESS PROGRAM AT THE WORKPLACE.	2021

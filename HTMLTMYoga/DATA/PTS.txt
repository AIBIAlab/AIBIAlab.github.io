1  587 145 DETERMINING PHYSICAL THERAPISTS' READINESS FOR INTEGRATING YOGA THERAPEUTICS INTO REHABILITATION. THE POSITIVE HEALTH EFFECTS OF YOGA HAVE LED PHYSICAL THERAPISTS (PTS) TO INTEGRATE ELEMENTS OF THE DISCIPLINE INTO THEIR TREATMENTS IN SOME SETTINGS. FORMAL PT EDUCATION INCLUDES LIMITED, IF ANY, TRAINING IN YOGA, AND THERE IS NO SYSTEM IN PLACE TO PROVIDE EDUCATION ON SAFELY IMPLEMENTING THERAPEUTIC YOGA (TY) AS AN ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT APPROACH. THE PURPOSES OF THIS STUDY WERE TO: (1) ASSESS THE READINESS OF PTS (THOSE WHO DO NOT CURRENTLY PRESCRIBE TY TO PATIENTS) TO INTEGRATE TY INTO TREATMENT, AND (2) DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF A 5-WEEK ONLINE TY TRAINING TO IMPROVE THE READINESS OF PTS TO UTILIZE TY IN THEIR PRACTICES. LICENSED PTS (N = 103) WERE RECRUITED NATIONALLY THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA AND EMAIL. ELIGIBLE AND CONSENTED PTS REGISTERED FOR A 5-WEEK ONLINE TY TRAINING COURSE. PTS' PERCEPTIONS OF TY AND THE ROLE OF SAFETY AND CONFIDENCE IN PRESCRIBING TY TO PATIENTS WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION. FEASIBILITY OUTCOMES WERE MEASURED AFTER COMPLETION OF THE COURSE. BENCHMARKS INCLUDED: (1) > 70% OF PTS WOULD FIND THE COURSE ACCEPTABLE; (2) > 60% WOULD FINISH THE COURSE; AND (3) THERE WOULD BE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN PTS' PERCEPTIONS OF TY. A TOTAL OF 95 ELIGIBLE PTS CONSENTED AND REGISTERED FOR THE COURSE, WITH 60 (63.1%) COMPLETING THE INTERVENTION. PRIOR TO THE TRAINING, MOST PTS FELT THEY WERE NOT READY (N = 19/60, 31.7%) OR SOMEWHAT READY (N = 25/60, 41.7%) TO INTEGRATE TY. MORE THAN HALF THOUGHT THE ONLINE TRAINING WAS ACCEPTABLE (N = 50/60, 83.3%) AND FINISHED THE COURSE (N = 60/95, 63.1%). THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN PERSONAL READINESS AND CONFIDENCE TO SAFELY PRESCRIBE TY, CURRENT UNDERSTANDING/KNOWLEDGE OF TY, AND FEELING ADEQUATELY TRAINED TO USE SOME FORM OF TY WITH PATIENTS. A 5-WEEK ONLINE TY TRAINING COURSE IS FEASIBLE TO DELIVER FOR IMPROVING PTS' READINESS TO PRESCRIBE TY. FUTURE STUDIES ARE PROPOSED TO TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TY TRAINING AND EDUCATION WITH PTS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                         
2 2285  40 THE USE OF YOGA BY PHYSICAL THERAPISTS IN THE UNITED STATES. HOW PHYSICAL THERAPISTS (PTS) IN THE UNITED STATES CURRENTLY USE YOGA IN THEIR CLINICAL PRACTICES IS UNKNOWN. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE HOW PTS IN THE UNITED STATES VIEW YOGA AS A PHYSICAL THERAPY (PT) TOOL AND HOW PTS USE YOGA THERAPEUTICALLY. THE AUTHORS CONDUCTED A 24-ITEM SURVEY VIA ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS OF THE GERIATRIC, ORTHOPEDIC, PEDIATRIC, AND WOMEN'S HEALTH SECTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHYSICAL THERAPY ASSOCIATION. PARTICIPANTS (N = 333) FROM 47 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA REPLIED. REPORTED USE OF THERAPEUTIC YOGA AMONG PARTICIPANTS WAS HIGH (70.6%). OF THOSE PARTICIPANTS, NEARLY A THIRD USE ASANA AND PRANAYAMA ONLY. MOST PARTICIPANTS USING THERAPEUTIC YOGA ALSO INCLUDE ADDITIONAL MINDFULNESS-RELATED ELEMENTS SUCH AS SENSORY AWARENESS, CONCENTRATION/FOCUS, AND/OR MEDITATION. MOST PARTICIPANTS LEARNED ABOUT YOGA THROUGH PERSONAL EXPERIENCES, WITH MANY PARTICIPANTS CITING LACK OF FAMILIARITY IN USING YOGA IN PT PRACTICE. SAFETY IS THE PRIMARY CONCERN OF PARTICIPANTS WHEN RECOMMENDING YOGA TO PATIENTS AS AN INDEPENDENT HEALTH AND WELLNESS ACTIVITY. INTERDISCIPLINARY COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PTS, YOGA THERAPISTS, AND YOGA TEACHERS IS WARRANTED TO ADDRESS THE POST-DISCHARGE NEEDS OF CLIENTS. HEALTHCARE CHANGES HAVE REQUIRED PTS TO ADAPT TO A BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL-SPIRITUAL MODEL (BPSS) FOR IMPROVED PATIENT OUTCOMES. THERAPEUTIC YOGA MAY PROVIDE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PTS TO EXPAND THEIR ROLE IN HEALTH AND WELLNESS AND CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT. THERE IS OPPORTUNITY FOR CONTINUING EDUCATION IN THERAPEUTIC YOGA FOR PTS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
3 2336  35 UNDERSTANDING NORTH AMERICAN YOGA THERAPISTS' ATTITUDES, SKILLS AND USE OF EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE: A CROSS-NATIONAL SURVEY. INTRODUCTION: LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE ADOPTION OF EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE (EBP) BY YOGA THERAPISTS (YTS). OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE THE ATTITUDES, SKILLS, TRAINING, USE, BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO THE USE OF EBP AMONGST NORTH AMERICAN YTS DESIGN: CROSS-SECTIONAL, DESCRIPTIVE SURVEY METHODS: SELF-IDENTIFIED YTS PRACTICING IN NORTH AMERICA WERE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN AN ONLINE SURVEY. YT ATTITUDES, SKILLS, TRAINING, UTILISATION, BARRIERS TO USE, AND FACILITATORS OF EBP USE WERE MEASURED USING THE 84-ITEM EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICE ATTITUDE AND UTILIZATION SURVEY (EBASE). RESULTS: 367 MEMBERS RESPONDED ( APPROXIMATELY 20% OF ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS). ATTITUDES TOWARDS EBP WERE GENERALLY POSITIVE WITH 88% AGREEING THAT PROFESSIONAL LITERATURE AND RESEARCH FINDINGS WERE USEFUL FOR THE PRACTICE OF YOGA THERAPY. MOST (80%) WERE INTERESTED IN IMPROVING THEIR SKILLS AND THE MAJORITY AGREED THAT EBP IMPROVES THE QUALITY OF CARE (68%), ASSISTS IN MAKING DECISIONS (74%) AND TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE YTS CLINICAL EXPERIENCE WHEN MAKING CLINICAL DECISIONS (59%). MODERATE TO MODERATELY-HIGH LEVELS OF PERCEIVED SKILL IN EBP WERE REPORTED MOSTLY UTILIZING ONLINE SEARCH ENGINES (51%). LACK OF CLINICAL EVIDENCE WAS THE ONLY NOTABLE BARRIER TO UPTAKE REPORTED BY YTS (48%). FACILITATORS TO EBP INCLUDED ACCESS TO ONLINE EBP EDUCATION MATERIALS (70.6%), ABILITY TO DOWNLOAD FULL-TEXT JOURNAL ARTICLES AND ACCESS TO FREE ONLINE DATABASES IN THE WORKPLACE (67.3%). CONCLUSION: NORTH AMERICAN YTS REPORT POSITIVE ATTITUDES, MODERATE TO MODERATELY-HIGH LEVELS OF PERCEIVED SKILL AND MODERATE UPTAKE OF EBP. THIS ALIGNS THEM WITH OTHER COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH PRACTITIONERS. INITIATIVES TO SUPPORT THE ADOPTION OF EBP ARE PROPOSED AS A MEANS OF IMPROVING BEST PRACTICE IN YOGA THERAPY.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
4  466  35 CHARACTERISTICS OF CLIENTS SEEKING YOGA THERAPY IN A UNIVERSITY-BASED STUDENT CLINIC. YOGA THERAPY IS AN EMERGING PROFESSION WITH RECENT DEVELOPMENT OF EDUCATIONAL COMPETENCIES, TRAINING PROGRAM ACCREDITATION, AND PRACTITIONER CERTIFICATION. IN THE UNITED STATES, MOST YOGA THERAPY TRAINING PROGRAMS ARE STUDIO-BASED AND DATA ON MENTORED CLINICAL ENCOUNTERS ARE LACKING. THIS STUDY AIMED TO CHARACTERIZE THE CLIENT POPULATION IN A UNIVERSITY-BASED MENTORED STUDENT CLINIC. AS PART OF A LARGER FEASIBILITY STUDY, DATA WERE COLLECTED AT ALL CLINIC VISITS FOR 70 CONSENTING CLIENTS. DATA COLLECTED INCLUDED DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, REASONS FOR PURSUING CARE, USE OF OTHER HEALTHCARE APPROACHES, AND THE PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES MEASUREMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM (PROMIS) FOR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. PARTICIPANTS WERE MOSTLY MIDDLE-AGED, WHITE, AND HIGHLY EDUCATED. COMMON REASONS FOR PURSUING CARE WERE PAIN AND MENTAL HEALTH. MOST USED MULTIPLE HEALTHCARE APPROACHES. AVERAGE SCORES FOR MOST PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES FELL WITHIN NORMAL RANGE AT BASELINE. FUTURE STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO BETTER CHARACTERIZE YOGA THERAPY USERS AND TO EXPAND ACCESS FOR POPULATIONS IN WHOM THE MODALITY IS UNDERUTILIZED DESPITE EMERGING EVIDENCE OF RELEVANCE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
5 2517  26 YOGA COMMUNITIES AND EATING DISORDERS: CREATING SAFE SPACE FOR POSITIVE EMBODIMENT. WITH ADEQUATE EDUCATION AND GUIDANCE, YOGA COMMUNITIES, AS PART OF THE THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPE IN THE 21ST CENTURY, CAN PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE PROMOTING POSITIVE EMBODIMENT FOR THOSE WITH, AND AT-RISK FOR, EATING DISORDERS (EDS). TO DO THIS, YOGA TEACHERS NEED TO KNOW HOW TO CREATE A BODY-POSITIVE COMMUNITY AND BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE AND RESPOND TO THOSE AT RISK AND STRUGGLING WITH EDS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS YOGA TEACHING METHODS ASSOCIATED WITH EDS AND ED RISK, BROADER CONCEPTUAL APPROACHES AND SPECIFIC PRACTICES ASSOCIATED WITH POSITIVE EMBODIMENT ARE OFFERED. THESE INCLUDE THE BROADER CONCEPTUAL APPROACHES OF: INTENTIONAL INCLUSION AND ACCEPTANCE, EXPERIENTIAL EMPHASIS, SUPPORTING POSITIVE EMBODIMENT AND INQUIRY. STUDIO PRAGMATICS ARE ALSO DETAILED AS RELATED TO THE BODY, BREATH, EMOTIONS, AND COMMUNITY. ASSESSMENT, REFERRAL, AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT ARE ALSO ADDRESSED.	2017

7 2314  28 TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA TRAINING IN KENYA: A QUALITATIVE PILOT STUDY ON FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY. THE CURRENT STUDY PRESENTS A PILOT QUALITATIVE EXPLORATION OF THE COLLABORATION OF TWO YOGA SERVICE AGENCIES IN IMPLEMENTING A TRAUMA-INFORMED MINDFULNESS-BASED TEACHING CURRICULUM IN KENYA, AFRICA. YOGA AND MINDFULNESS PRACTICES HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED AS SUCCESSFUL COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO MANAGING THE IMPACTS OF STRESS TRAUMA. THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF MINDFULNESS PROGRAMMING FOR YOGA TEACHERS IN THE NAIROBI REGION OF KENYA. GROUNDED THEORY IS USED TO EXPLORE SURVEY RESULTS. OUTCOMES DEMONSTRATE PROMISE FOR BOTH ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY. CURRICULUM TOOLS WERE VIEWED AS EFFECTIVE, AND PARTICIPANTS INDICATED INTENTION TO BOTH UTILIZE AND SHARE TOOLS. REFLECTIONS ON PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS AND IMPACTS ARE ADDRESSED, AS ARE POTENTIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPROVED PROGRAM TRANSLATION. FINDINGS SUGGEST THE POTENTIAL BENEFIT FOR FUTURE COLLABORATIONS, AND ALSO SUGGEST BEST PRACTICES CONSIDERATIONS FOR GLOBAL IMPLEMENTATION OF EMBODIED MINDFULNESS PROGRAMMING.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
8  414  20 BODIES IN YOGA: TANGLED DISCOURSES IN CANADIAN STUDIOS. THIS PAPER PRESENTS THE PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF A ONE AND A HALF-YEAR ETHNOGRAPHIC STUDY CONDUCTED IN VICTORIA, BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA. THE RESEARCH FOCUSED ON PARTICIPANTS' EXPERIENCES OF THEIR BODIES IN THE CONTEXT OF YOGA AS A HEALTH PRACTICE-SPECIFICALLY HOW THEY CONCEPTUALISED THEIR MUSCULOSKELETAL BODIES IN THIS PRACTICE THROUGH IDEAS OF SYSTEMS, FRAGMENTS, AND MATERIALITY. IT ARGUES THAT PARTICIPANTS' LARGER NARRATIVES ABOUT HEALTH AND HEALTHY BODIES INFORM HOW YOGA AS A HEALTH PRACTICE IS EMBEDDED IN DISCOURSES OF BODY WORK WHERE YOGA, HEALTH, AND PARTICULAR NOTIONS OF BODILY-NESS BECOME A PROJECT FOR THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE SELF INTO A PARTICULAR IDEA OF WHAT A BODY IS OR SHOULD BE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
9 1724  43 PERCEPTIONS OF MYELOPROLIFERATIVE NEOPLASM PATIENTS PARTICIPATING IN AN ONLINE YOGA INTERVENTION: A QUALITATIVE STUDY. MYELOPROLIFERATIVE NEOPLASMS (MPNS) ARE RARE HEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES WITH A SIGNIFICANT SYMPTOM BURDEN OFTEN LEFT UNRESOLVED DESPITE RECENT ADVANCES IN PHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPY. YOGA IS A NONPHARMACOLOGICAL STRATEGY THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE SYMPTOMS IN OTHER CANCERS AND MAY BE EFFECTIVE FOR IMPROVING SYMPTOMS IN MPN PATIENTS. ONLINE YOGA HELPS ADDRESS MANY OF THE COMMONLY REPORTED BARRIERS OF CANCER PATIENTS TO IN-PERSON INTERVENTIONS AND MAY MAKE YOGA MORE ACCESSIBLE TO MPNS. AN EXPLORATION OF MPN PATIENT PERCEPTIONS OF PARTICIPATION IN ONLINE YOGA IS NEEDED TO TAILOR INTERVENTIONS TO PATIENT NEEDS AND INFORM FUTURE STUDIES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE THE PERCEPTIONS OF MPN PATIENTS PARTICIPATING IN A 12-WEEK ONLINE YOGA INTERVENTION. THIS ARTICLE REPRESENTS THE COMBINED QUALITATIVE INTERVIEW DATA FROM TWO STUDIES. PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO COMPLETE 60 MIN/WK OF ONLINE, HOME-BASED YOGA AND WERE ASKED TO PARTICIPATE IN A 15- TO 20-MINUTE PHONE INTERVIEW POSTINTERVENTION. THE QUALITATIVE DATA WAS CODED IN NVIVO 11 FOR CONTENT ANALYSIS. THE TOTAL SAMPLE INCLUDED 39 MPN PATIENTS. ONLINE YOGA WAS WELL ACCEPTED AND LIKED AMONG THESE PATIENTS. THEY REPORTED PHYSICAL (EG, IMPROVED SLEEP, REDUCED FATIGUE) AND MENTAL (EG, REDUCED STRESS) HEALTH BENEFITS AND LIKED THE CONVENIENCE OF BEING ABLE TO DO YOGA AT HOME. ONLINE YOGA PROVIDES A FEASIBLE AND ATTRACTIVE FORMAT THROUGH WHICH TO DELIVER A NONPHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION AMONG MPN PATIENTS. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM THE EFFECTS OF ONLINE YOGA ON MPN PATIENT SYMPTOMS. THE QUALITATIVE FINDINGS PRESENTED HERE HELP INFORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE FUTURE TRIALS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
10 2891  36 YOGA: THEORY AND PRACTICE-A COURSE THAT ILLUSTRATES WHY YOGA BELONGS IN THE ACADEMY. THE COURSE "YOGA: THEORY AND PRACTICE" (YTP) EVOLVED FROM THE REALIZATION THAT ALTHOUGH GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC YOGA COURSE OFFERINGS WERE FILLED BEYOND CAPACITY WITH WAITLISTS, STUDENTS WERE OFTEN NOT BEING EXPOSED TO THE DEPTH AND BREADTH OF YOGA AS A HOLISTIC, INTEGRATIVE HEALTH PRACTICE. IN THE AUTHORS' EXPERIENCE, STUDENTS EXPERIENTIALLY UNDERSTOOD THE CONTRIBUTION THAT YOGA PRACTICE MADE IN THEIR LIVES AND SENSED THE HEALTH BENEFITS IT AFFORDED, YET THEY WERE HUNGRY FOR THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE FOR USING YOGA TO ADDRESS VARIOUS CLINICAL CONDITIONS AND TO UNDERSTAND WHY YOGA FELT LIKE A GROUNDING PRACTICE. STUDENTS WANTED SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE FOR WHAT THEY EXPERIENTIALLY KNEW TO BE TRUE: YOGA HELPED THEM FEEL MORE GROUNDED IN THEIR BODIES. IN 2004, WHEN YTP WAS DESIGNED, COLLEGE YOGA COURSES WERE TYPICALLY IN DEPARTMENTS OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION, AND LITTLE TO NO ATTENTION WAS GIVEN TO THE THEORETICAL/PHILOSOPHICAL ROOTS BEHIND WHY YOGA IS PRACTICED. THIS IS NO LONGER THE CASE. YTP IS AN ELECTIVE WITHIN AN ACADEMIC MINOR OF STUDY, INTEGRATIVE APPROACHES TO HEALTH AND WELLNESS, AND THE COURSE OFFERS COLLEGE STUDENTS AN INDEPTH, ACADEMIC STUDY OF YOGA THAT INCORPORATES BOTH SCIENTIFIC (REDUCTIONIST) AND HOLISTIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVES. THE CLINICAL/EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVE OF THIS COURSE IS TO EXPOSE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS (INCLUDING THOSE STUDYING TO BECOME HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS) TO THE EVIDENCE-BASED INTEGRATIVE HEALTH BENEFITS THAT YOGA AND YOGA THERAPY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO PROVIDE. USING THE UNIVERSITY'S EDUCATIONAL SETTING PROVIDES A VENUE TO AUGMENT THE FUTURE USE OF YOGA IN HEALTHCARE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
11 2032  33 TAILORING TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA FOR HIGH-RISK POPULATIONS IN PUBLIC-SECTOR SETTINGS. LOW-INCOME, RACIAL-MINORITY, HIGH-RISK POPULATIONS HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENTS FOR POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD), AND THEIR ACCEPTANCE OF COMPLEMENTARY INTERVENTIONS IS UNKNOWN. TRAUMA CENTER TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA (TC-TSY), WHICH HAS DEMONSTRATED EFFICACY IN COMMUNITY SAMPLES, HAS NOT YET BEEN WIDELY USED WITH ETHNIC MINORITY LOW-INCOME INDIVIDUALS. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A CULTURALLY TAILORED VERSION OF A TC-TSY INTERVENTION DELIVERED AS A DROP-IN SERVICE IN A PUBLIC HOSPITAL-BASED CLINIC TO PATIENTS WITH HISTORIES OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE AND SUICIDE ATTEMPTS. TC-TSY WAS ITERATIVELY TAILORED TO MEET THE UNIQUE CLINICAL NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THIS SETTING. GROUP FACILITATOR OBSERVATIONS ARE SUMMARIZED; THEY DESCRIBE A SUCCESSFUL INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION AND CULTURALLY INFORMED ADAPTATION OF THE GROUP INTERVENTION. THE FACILITATORS' OBSERVATIONS ILLUSTRATED THAT GROUP MEMBERS ACCEPTED THE INTEGRATION OF THIS STRUCTURED, GENTLE YOGA PRACTICE INTO OUTPATIENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAMMING AND IDENTIFIED SITE-SPECIFIC MODIFICATIONS TO INFORM FORMAL STUDY. THE PROCESS BY WHICH TC-TSY WAS ADAPTED AND IMPLEMENTED FOR BLACK INDIVIDUALS WITH A HISTORY OF INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA AT RISK FOR SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR CAN SERVE AS A GUIDE FOR TAILORING OTHER COMPLEMENTARY, INTEGRATIVE INTERVENTIONS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF UNIQUE CLINICAL SETTINGS. THIS PROCESS IS OFFERED AS A FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE SYSTEMATIC TESTING OF THIS COMPLEMENTARY, INTEGRATED, CULTURALLY ADAPTED TRAUMA THERAPY IN HIGH-RISK CLINICAL POPULATIONS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
12 2805  31 YOGA THERAPY IN THE GERMAN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. AN ESTIMATED 15.7 MILLION GERMANS ARE CURRENTLY PRACTICING YOGA OR ARE AT LEAST INTERESTED IN STARTING TO PRACTICE, AND THEY OFTEN PERCEIVE YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC APPROACH. FROM A HEALTHCARE SYSTEM PERSPECTIVE, THE SITUATION IS LESS CLEAR. HERE, YOGA IS ONLY RECOGNIZED AS A RECREATIONAL OR PREVENTIVE ACTIVITY. WHEN YOGA TEACHERS FULFILL SPECIFIC QUALIFICATIONS, THEIR PREVENTIVE YOGA CLASSES ARE COVERED BY THE STATUTORY HEALTH INSURANCES. ONLY THOSE WITH ADDITIONAL QUALIFICATIONS IN MEDICINE OR PSYCHOTHERAPY, HOWEVER, CAN INDEPENDENTLY USE AND PROMOTE "YOGA THERAPY." THE GENERAL PERCEPTION OF YOGA IN GERMANY AS A PREVENTIVE PRACTICE IS REFLECTED IN THE PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION OF YOGA PROVIDERS. MOST PROVIDERS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE YOGA TEACHERS RATHER THAN YOGA THERAPISTS AND ARE ORGANIZED MAINLY IN YOGA TEACHER ASSOCIATIONS. DESPITE THE UNCERTAIN LEGAL FRAMEWORK, YOGA IS NOW CONSIDERED IN A NUMBER OF MEDICAL GUIDELINES; IN A NUMBER OF HOSPITALS, YOGA IS PART OF MULTIMODAL INPATIENT TREATMENT PROGRAMS AND IS DELIVERED BY PHYSICAL THERAPISTS OR MEMBERS OF OTHER HEALTH PROFESSIONS. AN INCREASING NUMBER OF YOGA THERAPY CLINICAL TRIALS ARE CONDUCTED IN GERMANY, AND EFFORTS ARE UNDERWAY TO ESTABLISH YOGA THERAPY AS AN ACCEPTED ADJUNCT TREATMENT APPROACH FOR SELECTED MEDICAL CONDITIONS WITHIN THE GERMAN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
13  400  25 BEYOND THE EAST/WEST DICHOTOMY-THE COURSE YOGA: THEORY AND PRACTICE CONVEYS THE BENEFITS OF AN AYURVEDIC LENS FOR GLOBAL HEALTH. THE COURSE YOGA: THEORY AND PRACTICE (YTP) EVOLVED FROM THE REALIZATION THAT GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC OFFERINGS OF "YOGA COURSES" WERE FILLED BEYOND CAPACITY, WHILE STUDENTS WERE NOT BEING EXPOSED TO THE DEPTH AND BREADTH OF WHAT YOGA HAS TO OFFER AS A HOLISTIC, INTEGRATIVE PRACTICE, NOR HOW IT GREW UP ALONGSIDE AYURVEDA. STUDENTS EXPERIENTIALLY UNDERSTOOD THE CONTRIBUTION THAT YOGA PRACTICE MADE IN THEIR LIVES AND SENSED THE HEALTH BENEFITS IT AFFORDED. YET, THEY WERE HUNGRY FOR AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE LENS THROUGH WHICH YOGA EMERGED. YTP IS AN ELECTIVE COURSE WITHIN AN ACADEMIC MINOR OF STUDY, "INTEGRATIVE APPROACHES TO HEALTH AND WELLNESS" THAT PROVIDES NONWESTERN WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING GLOBAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH. THE FOCUS OF YTP IS TO OFFER COLLEGE STUDENTS AN IN-DEPTH, ACADEMIC STUDY OF YOGA, INCORPORATING BOTH SCIENTIFIC (REDUCTIONIST), AND AN AYURVEDA HEALTH PERSPECTIVE.

14  402  27 BEYOND TURMERIC AND YOGA: ADVANCE CARE PLANNING AND END-OF-LIFE CONSIDERATIONS AMONG ASIAN INDIAN AMERICAN HINDUS. HINDUISM IS THE FOURTH LARGEST RELIGION IN THE UNITED STATES; AN UNDERSTANDING OF HINDU BELIEFS AND PRACTICES WILL HELP HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS DELIVER CULTURALLY SENSITIVE CARE WHILE DISCUSSING ADVANCE CARE PLANNING AND END-OF-LIFE CARE FOR ADULT PATIENTS. FOR MANY WESTERNERS, THE PRACTICE OF YOGA, AYURVEDA, AND VEGETARIANISM IS USED BY PEOPLE STRIVING TO LIVE HEALTHFULLY. HOWEVER, WHAT MIGHT BE UNFAMILIAR TO WESTERNERS IS HOW FOR HINDUS, THESE PRACTICES REFLECT THEIR MILLENNIA-OLD SPIRITUALITY AND RELIGIOSITY. KNOWING THE HINDU BELIEFS OF ATMAN, BRAHMAN, KARMA, AND MOKSHA WILL HELP NURSES CONNECT TO HINDUS' VARIOUS END-OF-LIFE WISHES. IN ADDITION, GETTING FAMILIAR WITH INTERRELATING FACTORS SUCH AS LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ON PALLIATIVE CARE AND ADVANCE CARE PLANNING, FAMILY DYNAMICS, ACCULTURATION, AND PERSONAL PREFERENCES WILL ALLOW NURSES TO PROVIDE CULTURALLY COMPETENT CARE. BY FACILITATING END-OF-LIFE CONVERSATIONS AT AN EARLY STAGE, NURSES CAN PROMOTE CONFIDENCE AND SELF-EFFICACY FOR PATIENTS WHO MAY FEAR THAT THEIR RELIGIOSITY AND PERSONAL PRIORITIES ARE TRIVIALIZED BY ACCULTURATED FAMILY MEMBERS OR DISREGARDED BY THEIR ADOPTED HOMELAND. THIS CLINICAL ARTICLE PROVIDES NURSES WITH INFORMATION ABOUT ASIAN INDIAN AMERICAN HINDUS' BELIEFS AND PRACTICES, CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR ASSESSMENT, AND SUGGESTIONS TO SUPPORT PATIENTS' AND FAMILIES' END-OF-LIFE WISHES.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
15  440  35 CASE REPORT: THE USE OF MEDICAL YOGA FOR ADOLESCENT MENTAL HEALTH. MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES ARE EPIDEMIC AMONG YOUTH IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY. RECENT STUDIES SUGGEST THAT UP TO 50% OF ALL TEENAGERS HAVE COMPLAINTS RELATED TO STRESS, ANXIETY, AND/OR DEPRESSION. THIS PROBLEM IS ACCOMPANIED BY AN UNPRECEDENTED RISE IN THE RATES OF CHILD AND TEEN SUICIDE IN THE UNITED STATES. IN RESPONSE TO THIS EPIDEMIC, THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS IS RECOMMENDING UNIVERSAL DEPRESSION SCREENING FOR ALL TEENS. MEDICATIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO AMELIORATE MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS, AND MANY CAN BE SAFELY USED IN THE PRIMARY CARE SETTING. HOWEVER, MANY OF THESE MEDICATIONS HAVE UNWANTED SIDE EFFECTS OR MAY NOT BE FAMILIAR TO THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN. FOR THESE REASONS AND OTHERS, PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS REQUIRE ADDITIONAL APPROACHES TO RESPOND TO THE CHALLENGES IMPOSED BY A GROWING NUMBER OF PATIENTS REQUIRING MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT. MEDICAL YOGA THERAPY, PRESCRIBED BY A PHYSICIAN WITH SPECIAL YOGA THERAPY TRAINING, OFFERS A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE WAY TO SERVE THE PATIENT WITH PHYSICAL OR MENTAL CHALLENGES DISABILITIES. MEDICAL YOGA THERAPY IS AN INDIVIDUALIZED AND PERSONAL APPROACH TO THE PATIENT, AND IT MAY BE INTEGRATED WITH ANY CURRENT THERAPY OR MEDICAL REGIMEN. HERE, EVIDENCE FOR MEDICAL YOGA IS REVIEWED IN THE CONTEXT OF AN ADOLESCENT PATIENT WITH A COMMON DISORDER. YOGA PRACTICES, WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS ON MINDFULNESS, OFFER A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR A GROWING NUMBER OF PEDIATRIC PATIENTS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
16 1479  29 INTEGRATING BRAIN SCIENCE INTO HEALTH STUDIES: AN INTERDISCIPLINARY COURSE IN CONTEMPLATIVE NEUROSCIENCE AND YOGA. AS NEUROSCIENCE KNOWLEDGE GROWS IN ITS SCOPE OF SOCIETAL APPLICATIONS SO DOES THE NEED TO EDUCATE A WIDER AUDIENCE ON HOW TO CRITICALLY EVALUATE ITS RESEARCH FINDINGS. EFFORTS AT FINDING TEACHING APPROACHES THAT ARE INTERDISCIPLINARY, ACCESSIBLE AND HIGHLY APPLICABLE TO STUDENT EXPERIENCE ARE THUS ONGOING. THE ARTICLE DESCRIBES AN INTERDISCIPLINARY UNDERGRADUATE HEALTH COURSE THAT COMBINES THE ACADEMIC STUDY OF CONTEMPLATIVE NEUROSCIENCE WITH CONTEMPLATIVE PRACTICE, SPECIFICALLY YOGA. THE CLASS AIMS TO REACH A DIVERSE MIX OF STUDENTS BY TEACHING APPLICABLE, HEALTH-RELEVANT NEUROSCIENCE MATERIAL WHILE DIRECTLY CONNECTING IT TO FIRST-HAND EXPERIENCE. OUTCOMES INDICATE SUCCESS ON THESE GOALS: THE COURSE ATTRACTED A WIDE RANGE OF STUDENTS, INCLUDING NEARLY 50% NON-SCIENCE MAJORS. ON A PRE/POST TEST, STUDENTS SHOWED LARGE INCREASES IN THEIR KNOWLEDGE OF NEUROSCIENCE. STUDENTS' RATINGS OF THE COURSE OVERALL, OF INCREASES IN POSITIVE FEELINGS ABOUT ITS FIELD, AND OF THEIR PROGRESS ON SPECIFIC COURSE OBJECTIVES WERE HIGHLY POSITIVE. FINALLY, STUDENTS IN THEIR WRITTEN WORK APPLIED NEUROSCIENCE COURSE CONTENT TO THEIR PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL LIVES. SUCH RESULTS INDICATE THAT THIS APPROACH COULD SERVE AS A MODEL FOR THE INTERDISCIPLINARY, ACCESSIBLE AND APPLIED INTEGRATION OF RELEVANT NEUROSCIENCE MATERIAL INTO THE UNDERGRADUATE HEALTH CURRICULUM.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
17 2788  28 YOGA THERAPY DYADS: A NOVEL APPROACH TO CHRONIC PAIN MANAGEMENT IN UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS. YOGA THERAPY IS AN EMERGING INTEGRATIVE HEALTH APPROACH THAT APPLIES THE PRACTICES AND TEACHINGS OF YOGA FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH CLINICAL CONCERNS. IT IS GENERALLY OFFERED AS INDIVIDUAL SESSIONS BETWEEN A YOGA THERAPIST AND CLIENT OR IN A SMALL GROUP SETTING WITH SEVERAL CLIENTS WHO SHARE A CLINICAL CONCERN. HERE WE DESCRIBE A THIRD MODEL FOR CONSIDERATION- THE YOGA THERAPY DYAD. A DYAD INCLUDES TWO CLIENTS WORKING SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH A SINGLE YOGA THERAPIST AND DIFFERS FROM BOTH INDIVIDUAL AND SMALL GROUP SESSIONS IN THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES. THE YOGA THERAPY DYAD MODEL THAT IS DETAILED HERE WAS IMPLEMENTED AS PART OF A FEASIBILITY TRIAL ALONG WITH GROUP ACUPUNCTURE THERAPY FOR CHRONIC PAIN IN AN UNDERSERVED POPULATION. UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS ARE AT RISK FOR PAIN AND REDUCED ACCESS TO CARE. THIS PILOT MAY INFORM FUTURE RESEARCH, POLICY, EDUCATION, AND CLINICAL PRACTICE.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
18 1725  36 PERCEPTIONS OF YOGA THERAPY EMBEDDED IN TWO INPATIENT REHABILITATION HOSPITALS: AGENCY PERSPECTIVES. INPATIENT MEDICAL REHABILITATION HAS MAINTAINED A TYPICAL MEDICAL-MODEL FOCUS AND STRUCTURE FOR MANY YEARS. HOWEVER, AS INTEGRATIVE THERAPIES, SUCH AS YOGA THERAPY, EMERGE AS TREATMENTS WHICH CAN ENHANCE THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OF ITS PARTICIPANTS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO DETERMINE IF THEY CAN BE EASILY IMPLEMENTED INTO THE TRADITIONAL REHABILITATION STRUCTURE AND MILIEU. THEREFORE, THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE PERCEPTIONS OF KEY AGENCY PERSONNEL ON THE FEASIBILITY AND UTILITY OF YOGA THERAPY IMPLEMENTED IN INPATIENT REHABILITATION. THIS STUDY REPORTS THE RESULTS OF FOCUS GROUPS AND AN INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEW WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS (ADMINISTRATORS AND REHABILITATION THERAPISTS) FROM TWO REHABILITATION HOSPITALS FOLLOWING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF YOGA THERAPY. RESULTS FOCUSED ON SEVERAL KEY THEMES: FEASIBILITY FROM THE THERAPIST AND ADMINISTRATOR PERSPECTIVES, CHALLENGES TO IMPLEMENTATION, AND UTILITY AND BENEFIT. OVERALL, THE IMPLEMENTATION AND INTEGRATION OF YOGA THERAPY WERE POSITIVE; HOWEVER, SOME PROGRAMMATIC AND POLICY AND ORGANIZATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS REMAIN. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND FUTURE RESEARCH ARE PROVIDED.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
19 2408  33 YOGA AND HEALTHCARE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. THE EMERGENCE OF YOGA THERAPY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM BEGAN ABOUT 45 YEARS AGO WITH THE EMERGENCE OF YOGA THERAPY ORGANIZATIONS THAT OFFERED BOTH TREATMENT AND TRAINING. THE INTEGRATION OF YOGA INTO THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE (NHS) IS GRADUALLY HAPPENING BECAUSE: (A) YOGA RESEARCH SUPPORTS ITS EFFICACY AS A COST-EFFECTIVE, PREVENTIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR A HOST OF NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES; AND (B) THE ESCALATING ECONOMIC BURDEN OF LONG-TERM CONDITIONS IS OVERWHELMING THE NHS. THE NHS IS ACTIVELY DEVELOPING 'SUSTAINABILITY AND TRANSFORMATION PLANS' THAT INCLUDE YOGA. CHIEF AMONG THESE IS 'SOCIAL PRESCRIBING,' WHICH EMPOWERS PATIENTS WITH COMPLEX HEALTH NEEDS THROUGH ACTIVITIES GROUPS. THESE ACTIVITIES REDUCE SEDENTARY HABITS AND SOCIAL ISOLATION, WHILE HELPING PATIENTS TO BE MORE SELF-RELIANT. THE NHS HAS ALLOCATED POUND450 MILLION IN FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS FOR ITS OWN STAFF, IN WHICH STAFF YOGA CLASSES WERE EXPRESSLY MENTIONED. THE YOGA COMMUNITY IS MOBILIZING FORCES AND APPLYING FOR FUNDING TO PILOT RELEVANT NHS STAFF YOGA COURSES THAT CAN SUPPORT THE SERVICE IN ACHIEVING ITS VISION. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT INTEGRATING YOGA THERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF LOW BACK PAIN (LBP) INTO THE NHS WOULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS AS COMPARED WITH USUAL CARE. THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR HEALTH AND CARE EXCELLENCE (NICE) GUIDELINES ON LBP AND SCIATICA INCLUDE YOGA AS ONE OF THE RECOMMENDED TREATMENTS FOR THESE CONDITIONS. THREE GROUPS OF YOGA TEACHERS, USING DIFFERENT YOGA PRACTICES, HAVE GAINED TRACTION WITH THE NHS FOR THE APPLICATION OF YOGA THERAPY TO LBP. MANY REGIONAL HOSPITALS IN ENGLAND HAVE YOGA CLASSES. THE NHS CHOICES WEBSITE, WHICH CONVEYS INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC REGARDING TREATMENT OPTIONS, HAS A PAGE DEDICATED TO THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF YOGA. SEVERAL INSTITUTIONS OFFER COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING PROGRAMS IN YOGA THERAPY AND YOGA THERAPY IS RECOGNIZED AS AN OFFICIAL PROFESSION. THE YOGA IN HEALTHCARE ALLIANCE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED TO HELP INTEGRATE YOGA THERAPY INTO THE NHS. THIS CONSISTS OF PARLIAMENTARIANS, LEADERS IN THE NHS, YOGA RESEARCHERS, HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM LEADING YOGA ORGANIZATIONS.	2017	

20  155  37 A QUALITATIVE STUDY EXPLORING YOGA IN VETERANS WITH PTSD SYMPTOMS. QUANTITATIVE STUDIES OF YOGA HAVE REPORTED REDUCED POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) SYMPTOMS IN VETERANS, BUT LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW AND WHY VETERANS ARE ATTRACTED TO AND STICK WITH A YOGA PRACTICE. GUIDED BY THE HEALTH BELIEF MODEL, THIS STUDY EXAMINED VETERANS' PERCEPTIONS OF THE BENEFITS, BARRIERS, AND MOTIVATIONS TO CONTINUE PRACTICING TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA. INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH NINE INDIVIDUALS, FIVE OF WHOM COMPLETED A 6-WEEK TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA INTERVENTION DESIGNED FOR VETERANS AND FOUR WHO DID NOT COMPLETE THE INTERVENTION. TRANSCRIPTS WERE ANALYZED FOR THEMES. THE BENEFITS IDENTIFIED BY VETERANS WERE FINDING MENTAL STILLNESS, BODY AWARENESS, AND SOCIAL CONNECTION. THE BARRIERS WERE PERCEPTIONS THAT YOGA IS SOCIALLY UNACCEPTABLE, ESPECIALLY FOR MEN, AND PHYSICALLY UNCHALLENGING. UNDERSTANDING THESE BENEFITS AND BARRIERS CAN HELP TO MAKE YOGA MORE ATTRACTIVE TO SERVICE MEMBERS AND VETERANS. FOR EXAMPLE, MEDICAL PERSONNEL CAN REFER SERVICE MEMBERS AND VETERANS TO YOGA NOT ONLY FOR PTSD SYMPTOMS, BUT ALSO TO ADDRESS BACK PAIN AND TO REDUCE ISOLATION. ACCESS TO MALE YOGA INSTRUCTORS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE THEMSELVES SERVICE MEMBERS OR VETERANS, COULD BE EXPANDED, AND CLASSES COULD BE INTEGRATED INTO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ROUTINES REQUIRED OF ACTIVE-DUTY PERSONNEL. PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS CAN FEATURE MALE SERVICE MEMBERS AND VETERANS WITH CAPTIONS RELATED TO YOGA AS A WAY TO INCREASE RESILIENCY, SELF-SUFFICIENCY, AND PHYSICAL AND MENTAL MISSION READINESS.

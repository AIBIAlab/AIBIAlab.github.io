1 1482 100 INTEGRATING YOGA THERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF URINARY INCONTINENCE: A CASE REPORT. A 63-YEAR-OLD OVERWEIGHT FEMALE PREDIAGNOSED OF STRESS URINARY INCONTINENCE PRESENTED WITH EXACERBATED EVENTS OF URINE LEAKAGE. SHE WAS ADVISED A RESIDENTIAL LIFESTYLE AND BEHAVIORAL PROGRAM, PRIMARILY CONSISTING OF A MONITORED YOGA THERAPY MODULE, APART FROM HER ONGOING ANTICHOLINERGIC MEDICINE, FOR 21 DAYS. ASSESSMENTS WERE BASED ON A FREQUENCY VOLUME CHART, A BLADDER DIARY FOR THE ENTIRE DURATION OF TREATMENT, AND THE INTERNATIONAL CONSULTATION ON INCONTINENCE MODULAR QUESTIONNAIRE-URINARY INCONTINENCE SHORT FORM QUESTIONNAIRE ON THE DAYS OF ADMISSION AND DISCHARGE. A TOTAL OF 1.9 KG OF WEIGHT LOSS WAS OBSERVED DURING HER STAY. USAGE OF PAD, AS REPORTED IN HER DIARY, REDUCED FROM 3 TO 1 PER DAY. HER INTERNATIONAL CONSULTATION ON INCONTINENCE MODULAR QUESTIONNAIRE-URINARY INCONTINENCE SHORT FORM SCORE REDUCED FROM 16 TO 9, INDICATING BETTER CONTINENCE. SHE EXPRESSED SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING AND CONFIDENCE IN HER SOCIAL INTERACTIONS. THIS IS PROBABLY THE FIRST CASE REPORT DEMONSTRATING FEASIBILITY OF INTEGRATION OF YOGA THERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF URINARY INCONTINENCE.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
2  528  32 COMPARISON OF MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION VERSUS YOGA ON URINARY URGE INCONTINENCE: A RANDOMIZED PILOT STUDY. WITH 6-MONTH AND 1-YEAR FOLLOW-UP VISITS. OBJECTIVES: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION (MBSR) VERSUS YOGA ON URINARY URGE INCONTINENCE (UI) AT 8 WEEKS, 6 MONTHS, AND 1 YEAR AFTER BEGINNING AN 8-WEEK PROGRAM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PARTICIPANTS IN THIS PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED SINGLE-MASKED PILOT STUDY WERE WOMEN AGED 18 YEARS OR OLDER WITH URGE-PREDOMINANT INCONTINENCE, 5 OR MORE UI EPISODES (UIES) ON A 3-DAY VOIDING DIARY, AND NO RECENT ANTICHOLINERGIC USE. WOMEN WERE RANDOMIZED TO MBSR OR YOGA. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS THE PERCENT CHANGE OF UIE. RESULTS: OF 30 ENROLLEES (15 IN MBSR, 15 IN YOGA), 24 COMPLETED AT LEAST 5 OF 8 SESSIONS (13 IN MBSR AND 11 IN YOGA). TWENTY AND 21 WOMEN COMPLETED THE 6-MONTH AND 12-MONTH FOLLOW-UP VISITS, RESPECTIVELY. AT 8 WEEKS, 6 MONTHS, AND 12 MONTHS, THE MEDIAN PERCENT CHANGE FROM THE BASELINE IN UIE ON THE INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS WAS GREATER FOR THE MBSR GROUP (-55.6, -71.4, AND -66.7, RESPECTIVELY) COMPARED WITH THAT FOR THE YOGA GROUP (-33.3, -11.8, AND -16.7, RESPECTIVELY), WITH P VALUES RANGING FROM 0.01 TO 0.08. ON INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS, THE MEDIAN PERCENT CHANGE IN THE OVERACTIVE BLADDER SYMPTOM AND QUALITY OF LIFE-SHORT FORM AND THE HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE WAS GREATER AT EACH TIME POINT FOR MBSR THAN FOR YOGA BUT WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT ONLY AT 8 WEEKS (P = 0.003 AND 0.02, RESPECTIVELY). AS PER PROTOCOL ANALYSIS, AT 8 WEEKS, 6/13 AND 0/11 WOMEN IN MBSR AND YOGA, RESPECTIVELY, REPORTED THEY WERE VERY MUCH OR MUCH BETTER (P = 0.02), WHEREAS AT 1 YEAR, 6/12 AND 1/9 WOMEN IN MBSR AND YOGA, RESPECTIVELY, DID SO (P = 0.16). DISCUSSION: THESE RESULTS SUPPORT LARGER SCALE TRIALS TO EVALUATE MBSR, WHICH SEEMS TO BE A PROMISING TREATMENT OF UI.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
3 2880  16 YOGA: A BIOBEHAVIORAL APPROACH TO REDUCE SYMPTOM DISTRESS IN WOMEN WITH URGE URINARY INCONTINENCE. URGE URINARY INCONTINENCE IS A DEBILITATING CHRONIC CONDITION THAT POSES CHALLENGES FOR AFFECTED WOMEN AND THE CLINICIANS WHO CARE FOR THEM. MULTICOMPONENT BEHAVIORAL THERAPIES HAVE SHOWN PROMISE IN ALLOWING WOMEN TO MANAGE THEIR SYMPTOMS. NEW EVIDENCE SUGGESTS AN UNDERLYING PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC INFLAMMATORY PROCESS FOR URGE URINARY INCONTINENCE, AND COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES THAT ADDRESS THE PSYCHONEUROIMMUNOLOGY COMPONENT MAY IMPROVE THE HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THE MILLIONS OF WOMEN WITH THIS CONDITION. YOGA, A MIND-BODY THERAPY, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE INFLAMMATION AND MAY HELP IMPROVE SYMPTOMS OF URGE URINARY INCONTINENCE. MORE RESEARCH IS NECESSARY TO DEMONSTRATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA TO REDUCE URGE URINARY INCONTINENCE SYMPTOM BURDEN AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE.	2014

THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE PREVALENCE OF UI AMONG FEMALE GROUP FITNESS INSTRUCTORS, INCLUDING PILATES AND YOGA TEACHERS. METHODS: THIS WAS A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY OF 1,473 INSTRUCTORS REPRESENTING THREE OF THE LARGEST FITNESS COMPANIES RECRUITED FROM 59 FITNESS CENTERS IN NORWAY. THEY FILLED IN AN ONLINE SURVEY (QUESTBACK) ABOUT GENERAL HEALTH, EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND, AND NUMBER OF HOURS TEACHING PER WEEK. PREVALENCE OF UI WAS EVALUATED BY THE INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS ON INCONTINENCE QUESTIONNAIRE, SHORT FORM (ICIQ-UI SF). RESULTS: THREE OUT OF 152 MEN (2%) REPORTED UI. SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY-FIVE WOMEN, MEAN AGE 32.7 YEARS (RANGE 18-68) ANSWERED THE QUESTIONNAIRE. 26.3% OF ALL THE FEMALE INSTRUCTORS REPORTED TO HAVE UI, WITH 21.4% REPORTING LEAKAGE >/= ONCE A WEEK, 3.2% 2-3 TIMES/WEEK AND 1.7% >/= ONCE PER DAY. 24.4% REPORTED THE LEAKAGE TO BE SMALL TO MODERATE AND THE BOTHER SCORE WAS 4.6 (SD 2.4) OUT OF 21. 15.3% REPORTED LEAKAGE DURING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND 10.9% WHEN COUGHING/SNEEZING. 25.9% OF YOGA AND PILATES INSTRUCTORS REPORTED UI. CONCLUSIONS: THIS IS THE FIRST REPORT ON UI AMONG FITNESS INSTRUCTORS AND THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT UI IS PREVALENT AMONG FEMALE FITNESS INSTRUCTORS, INCLUDING YOGA AND PILATES TEACHERS. MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS TOPIC SEEMS TO BE IMPORTANT IN THE BASIC EDUCATION OF FITNESS INSTRUCTORS.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
5  498  22 COMBINED PELVIC MUSCLE EXERCISE AND YOGA PROGRAM FOR URINARY INCONTINENCE IN MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN. AIM: URINARY INCONTINENCE IS A MAJOR HEALTH PROBLEM AMONG MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN. PELVIC MUSCLE EXERCISE IS ONE OF THE PRIMARY INTERVENTIONS, BUT DIFFICULTY PERFORMING THIS EXERCISE HAS LED RESEARCHERS TO SEEK ALTERNATIVE OR CONJUNCTIVE EXERCISE. THIS STUDY AIMED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF A COMBINED PELVIC MUSCLE EXERCISE AND YOGA INTERVENTION PROGRAM ON URINARY INCONTINENCE. METHODS: A SINGLE GROUP PRE-/POST-TEST DESIGN WAS USED. SUBJECTS WERE RECRUITED FROM A COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER IN SEOUL, KOREA, AND A QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED. FIFTY-FIVE WOMEN PARTICIPATED IN THE FIRST DAY OF THE PROGRAM, 34 OF WHOM COMPLETED THE 8 WEEK, TWICE WEEKLY INTERVENTION PROGRAM. URINARY INCONTINENCE WAS MEASURED BY FIVE DOMAINS OF URINARY TRACT SYMPTOMS: FILLING FACTOR, VOIDING FACTOR, INCONTINENCE FACTOR, SEXUAL FUNCTION, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. ALSO MEASURED WERE ATTITUDE TOWARD PELVIC MUSCLE EXERCISE AND PELVIC MUSCLE STRENGTH. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE FOUND IN ATTITUDE TOWARD PELVIC MUSCLE EXERCISE, PELVIC MUSCLE STRENGTH, AND INCONTINENCE FACTOR. DAILY PERFORMANCE OF PELVIC MUSCLE EXERCISE WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH IMPROVED INCONTINENCE FACTOR AND WITH QUALITY OF LIFE RELATED TO URINARY TRACT SYMPTOMS. CONCLUSION: A COMBINED PELVIC MUSCLE EXERCISE AND YOGA PROGRAM WAS EFFECTIVE FOR IMPROVING OVERALL URINARY INCONTINENCE IN COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER ATTENDEES IN KOREA. FURTHER STUDY IS NEEDED WITH A CONTROL GROUP, DIFFERENT POPULATIONS, AND A LONGER INTERVENTION PERIOD.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
6   74  26 A GROUP-BASED YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION FOR URINARY INCONTINENCE IN WOMEN: A PILOT RANDOMIZED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY, EFFICACY, AND SAFETY OF A GROUP-BASED YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION FOR MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER WOMEN WITH URINARY INCONTINENCE. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A PILOT RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF AMBULATORY WOMEN AGED 40 YEARS AND OLDER WITH STRESS, URGENCY, OR MIXED-TYPE INCONTINENCE. WOMEN WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 6-WEEK YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM (N = 10) CONSISTING OF TWICE WEEKLY GROUP CLASSES AND ONCE WEEKLY HOME PRACTICE OR A WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 9). ALL PARTICIPANTS ALSO RECEIVED WRITTEN PAMPHLETS ABOUT STANDARD BEHAVIORAL SELF-MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES FOR INCONTINENCE. CHANGES IN INCONTINENCE WERE ASSESSED WITH 7-DAY VOIDING DIARIES. RESULTS: THE MEAN (SD) AGE WAS 61.4 (8.2) YEARS, AND THE MEAN BASELINE FREQUENCY OF INCONTINENCE WAS 2.5 (1.3) EPISODES/D. AFTER 6 WEEKS, THE TOTAL INCONTINENCE FREQUENCY DECREASED BY 70% (1.8 [0.9] FEWER EPISODES/D) IN THE YOGA THERAPY VERSUS 13% (0.3 [1.7] FEWER EPISODES/D) IN THE CONTROL GROUP (P = 0.049). PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA THERAPY GROUP ALSO REPORTED AN AVERAGE OF 71% DECREASE IN STRESS INCONTINENCE FREQUENCY (0.7 [0.8] FEWER EPISODES/D) COMPARED WITH A 25% INCREASE IN CONTROLS (0.2 [1.1] MORE EPISODES/D) (P = 0.039). NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN REDUCTION IN URGENCY INCONTINENCE WERE DETECTED BETWEEN THE YOGA THERAPY VERSUS CONTROL GROUPS (1.0 [1.0] VERSUS 0.5 [0.5] FEWER EPISODES/D; P = 0.20). ALL WOMEN STARTING THE YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM COMPLETED AT LEAST 90% OF THE GROUP CLASSES AND PRACTICE SESSIONS. TWO PARTICIPANTS IN EACH GROUP REPORTED ADVERSE EVENTS UNRELATED TO THE INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS PROVIDE PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE FEASIBILITY, EFFICACY, AND SAFETY OF A GROUP-BASED YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE URINARY INCONTINENCE IN WOMEN.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
7 2432  28 YOGA AND PILATES COMPARED TO PELVIC FLOOR MUSCLE TRAINING FOR URINARY INCONTINENCE IN ELDERLY WOMEN: A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED PILOT TRIAL. BACKGROUND: AND PURPOSE: THERE IS LIMITED EVIDENCE FROM RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) REGARDING THE USE OF YOGA AND PILATES FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF URINARY INCONTINENCE (UI) IN WOMEN. THIS STUDY AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE PRELIMINARY EFFECTS OF USING PILATES AND YOGA TO MANAGE UI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AN ASSESSOR-BLINDED, PROSPECTIVE, THREE-ARM PARALLEL-GROUP RANDOMISED CONTROLLED PILOT TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED IN THREE ELDERLY CARE CENTRES IN HONG KONG. THIRTY WOMEN AGED 60 YEARS OR ABOVE WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. STUDY CENTRES WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EACH OF THE THREE INTERVENTIONS (YOGA, PILATES AND PELVIC FLOOR MUSCLE TRAINING [PFMT; STANDARD CARE CONTROL]). STUDY INTERVENTIONS WERE PROVIDED ONCE A WEEK FOR FOUR WEEKS, FOLLOWED BY UNSUPERVISED CD-GUIDED HOME EXERCISES FOR EIGHT WEEKS. OUTCOMES INCLUDED THE INTERNATIONAL CONSULTATION ON INCONTINENCE QUESTIONNAIRE-SHORT FORM (ICIQ-SF), 1-H PAD TEST, AND FEASIBILITY MEASURES SUCH AS ADHERENCE TO THE INTERVENTION PROGRAMME, RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION RATES AND SAFETY. OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE, 4 AND 12 WEEKS. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED USING TWO-WAY REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE. RESULTS: ALL THREE INTERVENTIONS DEMONSTRATED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON ICIQ-SF SCORES FROM BASELINE TO WEEKS 4 AND 12. SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS IN UI WERE REPORTED FOR YOGA COMPARED WITH PILATES (MEAN: -2.93, 95% CI -5.35, -0.51; P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: YOGA POSES INTENDED TO ADDRESS THE PELVIC FLOOR AND CORE MUSCLES WERE FOUND TO HAVE SUPERIOR BENEFITS OVER PILATES EXERCISES IN TERMS OF IMPROVED CONTINENCE MEASURED WITH THE ICIQ-SF.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
8 2273  33 THE ROLE OF YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF BLADDER PAIN SYNDROME: A SINGLE-ARM PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: BLADDER PAIN SYNDROME (BPS) IS A DEVASTATING UROLOGIC CONDITION CHARACTERIZED BY IRRITATIVE BLADDER SYMPTOMS, PELVIC PAIN, AND DYSPAREUNIA. FIRST-LINE TREATMENT INCLUDES DIETARY, SELF-CARE AND BEHAVIORAL MODIFICATIONS. THE ANCIENT PRACTICE OF YOGA IS WELL SUITED TO TREAT BPS, BUT EVIDENCE IS LACKING ON ITS USE. AIMS: TO INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFICACY OF AN INTEGRATED YOGA MODULE ON BPS OUTCOMES AS MEASURED BY SELF-REPORTED QUESTIONNAIRES FROM BASELINE TO 3 MONTHS AFTER THERAPY. METHODS AND MATERIALS: THIS WAS A PROSPECTIVE SINGLE-ARM STUDY OF 8 PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT 3 MONTHS OF INTEGRATED YOGA THERAPY. THE TREATMENT MODULE WAS PERFORMED 3 TO 4 TIMES WEEKLY AT HOME WITH 1 SESSION PERFORMED WEEKLY IN-OFFICE DURING THE FIRST MONTH TO ENSURE PROPER PERFORMANCE OF POSTURES. PATIENTS COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES (PELVIC PAIN AND URGENCY/FREQUENCY PATIENT SYMPTOM SCALE [PUF], PELVIC FLOOR IMPACT QUESTIONNAIRE - SHORT FORM 7 [PFIQ-7], SHORT FORM 36 QUESTIONNAIRE [SF-36], PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX [PSQI]) AT BASELINE AND 3 MONTHS, INCLUDING PATIENT GLOBAL IMPRESSION OF IMPROVEMENT (PGI-I) AT THE 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP VISIT. VOIDING DIARIES WERE ALSO REQUESTED AT BASELINE AND AT THE 3-MONTH ASSESSMENT. RESULTS: THERE WAS A TREND TOWARD IMPROVEMENT REGARDING PATIENTS' RESPONSES TO ALL QUESTIONNAIRES 3 MONTHS AFTER YOGA THERAPY, WITH THE ONLY STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS NOTED IN SOCIAL FUNCTION AND PAIN COMPONENTS OF THE SF-36. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES NOTED ON THE VOIDING DIARIES EXCEPT A NON-STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT TREND TOWARD INCREASED VOIDED VOLUMES. PATIENTS RATED THEIR EXPERIENCES WITH YOGA THERAPY POSITIVELY. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA THERAPY FOR BPS SHOWED EVIDENCE OF BENEFIT FOR IMPROVING BOTHERSOME BLADDER SYMPTOMS, PAIN AND VOIDING. A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WILL FOLLOW TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFICACY OF THIS YOGA MODULE AGAINST A CONTROL GROUP.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
9 1916  16 ROLE OF TEMPORALIS MUSCLE OVER ACTIVITY IN CHRONIC TENSION TYPE HEADACHE: EFFECT OF YOGA BASED MANAGEMENT. THE ROLE OF CENTRAL VERSUS PERIPHERAL MECHANISMS HAS ALWAYS BEEN QUESTIONED WHILE EXPLAINING THE ETIOPATHOGENESIS OF CHRONIC TENSION TYPE HEADACHE (CTTH). THE FOLLOWING STUDY WAS DONE TO STUDY THE ROLE OF MUSCLE SPASM IN CTTH. 15 PATIENTS OF CTTH AND 7 AGE MATCHED CONTROLS WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY AND THEIR M. TEMPORALIS EMG WAS RECORDED FOR ONE MINUTE EACH DURING REST, MENTAL ACTIVITY AND MAXIMAL VOLUNTARY CONTRACTION AND SUBJECTIVE PAIN SCORING WAS DONE BY VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE. THE RESULTS REVEALED SIGNIFICANT OVERACTIVITY OF M.TEMPORALIS IN CTTH PATIENTS AT REST WHEN COMPARED WITH CONTROL SUBJECTS (P = 0.01 AND 0.03 LEFT AND RIGHT SIDE RESPECTIVELY). AFTER RESPECTIVE INTERVENTIONS NAMELY NON STEROIDAL ANTI INFLAMMATORY DRUGS, BOTULINUM TOXIN INJECTIONS AND YOGIC LIFE STYLE COURSE, THE EMG RECORDS REVEALED DECREASE IN THE MEAN EMG AMPLITUDE OF M. TEMPORALIS DURING REST AND MENTAL ACTIVITY MORE SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER YOGA BASED INTERVENTIONS (P = 0.03) AND SUBJECTIVE PAIN SCORES DECREASED FROM 7.00 +/- 2.10 TO 2.00 +/- 1.26 (P = 0.02) SUPPORTING THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF SUCH NON INVASIVE TECHNIQUES.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
10   73  30 A GROUP-BASED YOGA PROGRAM FOR URINARY INCONTINENCE IN AMBULATORY WOMEN: FEASIBILITY, TOLERABILITY, AND CHANGE IN INCONTINENCE FREQUENCY OVER 3 MONTHS IN A SINGLE-CENTER RANDOMIZED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: BECAUSE OF THE LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING CLINICAL TREATMENTS FOR URINARY INCONTINENCE, MANY WOMEN WITH INCONTINENCE ARE INTERESTED IN COMPLEMENTARY STRATEGIES FOR MANAGING THEIR SYMPTOMS. YOGA HAS BEEN RECOMMENDED AS A BEHAVIORAL SELF-MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR INCONTINENCE, BUT EVIDENCE OF ITS FEASIBILITY, TOLERABILITY, AND EFFICACY IS LACKING. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY AND TOLERABILITY OF A GROUP-BASED THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM FOR AMBULATORY MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER WOMEN WITH INCONTINENCE, AND TO EXAMINE PRELIMINARY CHANGES IN INCONTINENCE FREQUENCY AS THE PRIMARY EFFICACY OUTCOME AFTER 3 MONTHS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AMBULATORY WOMEN AGED 50 YEARS OR OLDER WHO REPORTED AT LEAST DAILY STRESS-, URGENCY-, OR MIXED-TYPE INCONTINENCE, WERE NOT ALREADY ENGAGED IN YOGA, AND WERE WILLING TO TEMPORARILY FORGO CLINICAL INCONTINENCE TREATMENTS WERE RECRUITED INTO A RANDOMIZED TRIAL IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. WOMEN WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO TAKE PART IN A PROGRAM OF TWICE-WEEKLY GROUP CLASSES AND ONCE-WEEKLY HOME PRACTICE FOCUSED ON IYENGAR-BASED YOGA TECHNIQUES SELECTED BY AN EXPERT YOGA PANEL (YOGA GROUP), OR A NONSPECIFIC MUSCLE STRETCHING AND STRENGTHENING PROGRAM DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A RIGOROUS TIME-AND-ATTENTION CONTROL (CONTROL GROUP) FOR 3 MONTHS. ALL PARTICIPANTS ALSO RECEIVED WRITTEN, EVIDENCE-BASED INFORMATION ABOUT BEHAVIORAL INCONTINENCE SELF-MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES (PELVIC FLOOR EXERCISES, BLADDER TRAINING) CONSISTENT WITH USUAL FIRST-LINE CARE. INCONTINENCE FREQUENCY AND TYPE WERE ASSESSED BY VALIDATED VOIDING DIARIES. ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE MODELS EXAMINED WITHIN- AND BETWEEN-GROUP CHANGES IN INCONTINENCE FREQUENCY AS THE PRIMARY EFFICACY OUTCOME OVER 3 MONTHS. RESULTS: OF THE 56 WOMEN RANDOMIZED (28 TO YOGA, 28 TO CONTROL), THE MEAN AGE WAS 65.4 (+/-8.1) YEARS (RANGE, 55-83 YEARS), THE MEAN BASELINE INCONTINENCE FREQUENCY WAS 3.5 (+/-2.0) EPISODES/D, AND 37 WOMEN (66%) HAD URGENCY-PREDOMINANT INCONTINENCE. A TOTAL OF 50 WOMEN COMPLETED THEIR ASSIGNED 3-MONTH INTERVENTION PROGRAM (89%), INCLUDING 27 IN THE YOGA AND 23 IN THE CONTROL GROUP (P = .19). OF THOSE, 24 (89%) IN THE YOGA AND 20 (87%) IN THE CONTROL GROUP ATTENDED AT LEAST 80% OF GROUP CLASSES. OVER 3 MONTHS, TOTAL INCONTINENCE FREQUENCY DECREASED BY AN AVERAGE OF 76% FROM BASELINE IN THE YOGA AND 56% IN THE CONTROL GROUP (P = .07 FOR BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCE). STRESS INCONTINENCE FREQUENCY ALSO DECREASED BY AN AVERAGE OF 61% IN THE YOGA GROUP AND 35% IN CONTROLS (P = .045 FOR BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCE), BUT CHANGES IN URGENCY INCONTINENCE FREQUENCY DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN GROUPS. A TOTAL OF 48 NONSERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED, INCLUDING 23 IN THE YOGA AND 25 IN THE CONTROL GROUP, BUT NONE WERE DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO YOGA OR CONTROL PROGRAM PRACTICE. CONCLUSION: FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE THE FEASIBILITY OF RECRUITING AND RETAINING INCONTINENT WOMEN ACROSS THE AGING SPECTRUM INTO A THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM, AND PROVIDE PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE OF REDUCTION IN TOTAL AND STRESS-TYPE INCONTINENCE FREQUENCY AFTER 3 MONTHS OF YOGA PRACTICE. WHEN TAUGHT WITH ATTENTION TO WOMEN'S CLINICAL NEEDS, YOGA MAY OFFER A POTENTIAL COMMUNITY-BASED BEHAVIORAL SELF-MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR INCONTINENCE TO ENHANCE CLINICAL TREATMENT, ALTHOUGH FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD ASSESS WHETHER YOGA OFFERS UNIQUE BENEFITS FOR INCONTINENCE ABOVE AND BEYOND OTHER PHYSICAL ACTIVITY-BASED INTERVENTIONS.	2019	

11 2528  18 YOGA EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR REDUCING DRUG DEPENDENCY AND PROMOTING BETTER ASTHMA CONTROL FOR CHRONIC ASTHMATIC CHILDREN: A MULTICITY EXPERIMENT. THIS ARTICLE REPORTS A 1-YEAR LONG YOGA EDUCATION PROGRAM (YEP) EXPERIMENT AIMED AT REDUCING DRUG DEPENDENCY AND PROMOTING BETTER ASTHMA CONTROL FOR CHRONIC ASTHMATIC CHILDREN. PARTICIPANTS WERE 450 CHRONIC ASTHMATIC CHILDREN ACROSS 4 CITIES. TWO MEASURES WERE USED: PEDIATRIC ASTHMA DIARY (PAD) AND CHILDHOOD ASTHMA CONTROL TEST (C-ACT). RESULTS INDICATED THAT INTERVENTION GROUP CHILDREN HAD BETTER ASTHMA CONTROL IN TERMS OF LOWER AVERAGE PAD SCORES AND HIGHER C-ACT SCORES AND REDUCED DRUG INTAKE VIS-A-VIS THE CONTROL GROUP. WITHIN THE INTERVENTION COHORT, ASTHMA SYMPTOMS PERSISTENCE WAS LOWER AND CONTROL WAS HIGHER FOR CHILDREN FROM ASIAN CITIES, BOYS, HINDUS, MIDDLE-CLASS CHILDREN, THOSE WHOSE MOTHERS WERE THEIR PRIMARY CAREGIVERS, WHO LIVED IN STANDARD FAMILY SETUPS, WHO ALSO ATTENDED THE OPTIONAL YEP ROUNDS, AND REGULARLY SELF-PRACTICED. THE STRONGEST PREDICTOR OF LOWER POSTTEST PAD SCORES AND HIGHER C-ACT SCORES WAS SELF-PRACTICE. THE YEP CAN BE USED AS AN EFFECTIVE COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC ASTHMATIC CHILDREN.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
12 2561  20 YOGA FOR CHRONIC NECK PAIN: A 12-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF A 9-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION ON CHRONIC NONSPECIFIC NECK PAIN 12 MONTHS AFTER COMPLETION. DESIGN: TWELVE-MONTH FOLLOW-UP OF THE POOLED DATA OF BOTH ARMS OF A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: DEPARTMENT OF INTERNAL AND INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE AT AN ACADEMIC TEACHING HOSPITAL. SUBJECTS: FIFTY-ONE PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC NONSPECIFIC NECK PAIN (MEAN AGE 47.8 YEARS; 82.4% FEMALE). INTERVENTIONS: A 9-WEEK YOGA GROUP INTERVENTION. OUTCOME MEASURES: NECK PAIN INTENSITY (100-MM VISUAL ANALOG SCALE), FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY (NECK DISABILITY INDEX), HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (SHORT-FORM 36 QUESTIONNAIRE, SF-36), GENERIC DISABILITY (DAYS WITH RESTRICTED ACTIVITIES), AND GLOBAL IMPROVEMENT. RESULTS: FROM BASELINE TO 12-MONTH FOLLOW-UP, PAIN INTENSITY IMPROVED FROM 48.81 +/- 17.71 TO 32.31 +/- 20.68 (P < 0.001), NECK-RELATED DISABILITY DECREASED FROM 25.26 +/- 9.02 TO 19.49 +/- 11.52 (P = 0.001), AND BODILY PAIN IN THE SF-36 IMPROVED FROM 49.37 +/- 12.40 TO 59.26 +/- 17.57 (P = 0.005). IMPROVEMENTS IN PAIN INTENSITY WERE PREDICTED BY WEEKLY MINUTES OF YOGA PRACTICE DURING THE PAST 4 WEEKS (R(2) = 0.12, P = 0.028); IMPROVED NECK-RELATED DISABILITY (R(2) = 0.24, P = 0.001) AND BODILY PAIN (R(2) = 0.26, P = 0.006) WERE PREDICTED BY REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE DURING THE PAST 12 MONTHS. GENERIC DISABILITY DID NOT DECREASE SIGNIFICANTLY. TWENTY-FOUR PATIENTS (68.6%) RATED THEIR HEALTH AS AT LEAST SOMEWHAT IMPROVED. CONCLUSIONS: A 9-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION IMPROVED PAIN AND NECK-RELATED DISABILITY FOR AT LEAST 12 MONTHS AFTER COMPLETION. SUSTAINED YOGA PRACTICE SEEMS TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT PREDICTOR OF LONG-TERM EFFECTIVENESS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
13 1123  19 EFFICACY OF NATUROPATHY AND YOGA IN BRONCHIAL ASTHMA. THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF A ONE MONTH IN-PATIENT NATUROPATHY AND YOGA PROGRAMME FOR PATIENTS WITH ASTHMA. RETROSPECTIVE DATA OF 159 BRONCHIAL ASTHMA PATIENTS, UNDERGOING THE NATUROPATHY AND YOGA PROGRAMME, WAS ANALYZED FOR FORCED VITAL CAPACITY, FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME AT THE END OF 1 SECOND, MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE ON ADMISSION, 11TH DAY, ON DISCHARGE AND ONCE IN THREE MONTHS FOR THREE YEARS. THE PAIRED SAMPLE T TEST RESULTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE FORCED VITAL CAPACITY AND FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME FROM THE DATE OF ADMISSION UP TO 6TH MONTH (P < 0.0035) POST BONFERRONI CORRECTION. MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FROM ADMISSION TILL THE DATE OF DISCHARGE (P < 0.0035) AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FROM ADMISSION TILL THE 36TH MONTH OF FOLLOW-UP (P < 0.0035), POST BONFERRONI CORRECTION.

15  125  21 A PILOT STUDY OF YOGA TREATMENT IN CHILDREN WITH FUNCTIONAL ABDOMINAL PAIN AND IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME. OBJECTIVES: THE AIM OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA EXERCISES ON PAIN FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY AND ON QUALITY OF LIFE IN CHILDREN WITH FUNCTIONAL ABDOMINAL PAIN. DESIGN: 20 CHILDREN, AGED 8-18 YEARS, WITH IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME (IBS) OR FUNCTIONAL ABDOMINAL PAIN (FAP) WERE ENROLLED AND RECEIVED 10 YOGA LESSONS. PAIN INTENSITY AND PAIN FREQUENCY WERE SCORED IN A PAIN DIARY AND QUALITY OF LIFE WAS MEASURED WITH THE KIDSCREEN QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE (KQOL). RESULTS: IN THE 8-11 YEAR OLD GROUP AND THE 11-18 YEAR OLD GROUP PAIN FREQUENCY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED AT THE END OF THERAPY (P=0.031 AND P=0.004) COMPARED TO BASELINE. IN THE 8-11 YEAR GROUP PAIN INTENSITY WAS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED AT THIS TIME POINT (P=0.015). AFTER 3 MONTHS THERE STILL WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN PAIN FREQUENCY IN THE YOUNGER PATIENT GROUP (P=0.04) AND A BORDERLINE SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN PAIN FREQUENCY IN THE TOTAL GROUP (P=0.052). PARENTS REPORTED A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER KQOL-SCORE AFTER YOGA TREATMENT. CONCLUSION: THIS PILOT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT YOGA EXERCISES ARE EFFECTIVE FOR CHILDREN AGED 8-18 YEARS WITH FAP, RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF PAIN INTENSITY AND FREQUENCY, ESPECIALLY IN CHILDREN OF 8-11 YEARS OLD.	2011

WE REPORT A CASE OF ISOLATED RUPTURE OF THE LATERAL COLLATERAL LIGAMENT (LCL) OF THE KNEE WHILE ATTEMPTING TO PLACE THE LEFT FOOT BEHIND THE HEAD DURING YOGA PRACTICE. THE 34-YEAR-OLD MAN HAD DISCOMFORT OF THE LATERAL ASPECT OF THE KNEE PARTICULARLY WITH VARUS STRAIN. A MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGE REVEALED RUPTURE OF THE LCL AT THE INSERTION ONTO THE FIBULA. THE PATIENT HAD GRADE-II LAXITY OF THE LCL AND WAS TREATED NON-OPERATIVELY. AT THE 12-MONTH FOLLOW-UP, GRADE-I LAXITY OF THE LCL REMAINED CLINICALLY EVIDENT, BUT FUNCTION WAS NOT IMPAIRED.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
17 1346  20 HYPERTENSION ANALYSIS OF STRESS REDUCTION USING MINDFULNESS MEDITATION AND YOGA: RESULTS FROM THE HARMONY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: THE HARMONY STUDY WAS A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL EXAMINING THE EFFICACY OF AN 8-WEEK MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION (MBSR) PROGRAM FOR BLOOD PRESSURE (BP) LOWERING AMONG UNMEDICATED STAGE 1 HYPERTENSIVE PARTICIPANTS. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS DIAGNOSED WITH STAGE 1 HYPERTENSION BASED ON AMBULATORY BP WERE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER IMMEDIATE TREATMENT OF MBSR FOR 8 WEEKS OR WAIT-LIST CONTROL. PRIMARY OUTCOME ANALYSIS EVALUATED WHETHER CHANGE IN AWAKE AND 24-HOUR AMBULATORY BP FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 12 WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE 2 GROUPS. A WITHIN-GROUP BEFORE AND AFTER MBSR ANALYSIS WAS ALSO PERFORMED. RESULTS: THE STUDY ENROLLED 101 ADULTS (38% MALE) WITH BASELINE AVERAGE 24-HOUR AMBULATORY BP OF 135+/-7.9/82+/-5.8MM HG AND DAYTIME AMBULATORY BP OF 140+/-7.7/87+/-6.3 MMHG. AT WEEK 12, THE CHANGE FROM BASELINE IN 24-HOUR AMBULATORY BP WAS 0.4+/-6.7/0.0+/-4.9MM HG FOR THE IMMEDIATE INTERVENTION AND 0.4+/-7.8/-0.4+/-4.6MM HG FOR THE WAIT-LIST CONTROL. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INTERVENTION AND WAIT-LIST CONTROL FOR ALL AMBULATORY BP PARAMETERS. THE SECONDARY WITHIN-GROUP ANALYSIS FOUND A SMALL REDUCTION IN BP AFTER MBSR COMPARED WITH BASELINE, A FINDING LIMITED TO FEMALE SUBJECTS IN A SEX ANALYSIS. CONCLUSIONS: MBSR DID NOT LOWER AMBULATORY BP BY A STATISTICALLY OR CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT IN UNTREATED, STAGE 1 HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS WHEN COMPARED WITH A WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP. IT LEAVES UNTESTED WHETHER MBSR MIGHT BE USEFUL FOR LOWERING BP BY IMPROVING ADHERENCE IN TREATED HYPERTENSIVE PARTICIPANTS.

PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: CHANGE IN STATE AND TRAIT ANXIETY QUESTIONNAIRE (STAI-Y; 40 ITEMS), SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING INVENTORY (SUBI; 40 ITEMS), AND NEUROTICISM EXTRAVERSION OPENNESS TO EXPERIENCE FIVE FACTOR PERSONALITY INVENTORY REVISED (NEO-FF PI-R; 60 ITEMS) AT THE END OF INTERVENTION. RESULTS: FOLLOWING INTERVENTION, THE STAI-Y SCORES REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY (P<0.001) AT DAY 10 (66.7 +/- 13.0) VERSUS DAY 1 (72.5 +/- 14.7). ALSO, POSITIVE SUBI SCORES (F1- F6) IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY (P<0.01) AT DAY 10 VERSUS DAY 1. SIMILARLY NEO-FF PI-R SCORES IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY (P<0.001) AT DAY 10 VERSUS DAY 1. CONTROL GROUP SHOWED AN INCREASE IN STAI-Y WHILE SUBI AND NEO-FF PI-R SCORES REMAINED COMPARABLE AT DAY 10 VERSUS DAY 1. CONCLUSIONS: THE OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT A SHORT-TERM, YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION MAY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE ANXIETY AND IMPROVE SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING AND PERSONALITY IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC DISEASES.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
19 2802  19 YOGA THERAPY IN CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS DECREASES IMMEDIATE ANXIETY AND JOINT PAIN. THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOGA MIGHT ALLEVIATE SYMPTOMS OF PAIN, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION IN CHILDREN WITH CYSTIC FIBROSIS (CF). CF IS THE MOST COMMON GENETIC, LIFE-LIMITING CHRONIC DISEASE AMONG CAUCASIAN POPULATIONS. IT PRIMARILY AFFECTS THE LUNGS BUT ALSO MANY OTHER SECRETORY ORGANS AND CONSEQUENTLY LEADS TO SIGNIFICANT MORBIDITIES. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT CHILDREN WITH CF HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND PAIN COMPARED TO THEIR HEALTHY COUNTERPARTS. SUBJECTS PARTICIPATED IN SIX ONE-ON-ONE SESSIONS OVER A 10-WEEK PERIOD WITH A CERTIFIED INSTRUCTOR WHO DESIGNED EACH YOGA PRACTICE BASED ON A PREESTABLISHED LIST OF 30 YOGA ASANAS. QUESTIONNAIRES EVALUATING PAIN, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, SUSTAINED ANXIETY, IMMEDIATE ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION WERE ADMINISTERED. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PREMEASURES AND POSTMEASURES WERE EVALUATED USING A TWO-SIDED TEST. TWENTY SUBJECTS WERE ASSESSED (12 FEMALES/8 MALES), MEDIAN AGE OF 11 (7-20) YEARS. MEAN IMMEDIATE ANXIETY SCORES DECREASED (BEFORE SESSION TO AFTER SESSION 29 TO 23.6, RESPECTIVELY, P < 0.001). JOINT PAIN IMPROVED (3.25 TO 3.65, P = 0.028). CFQ-R EMOTION SUBSCALE IMPROVED FROM 79.2 TO 85 (P = 0.073), AND THE RESPIRATORY SUBSCALE IMPROVED FROM 66.7 TO 79.2 (P = 0.076). OTHER RESULTS WERE LESS NOTABLE. WE CONCLUDE THAT YOGA MAY REDUCE IMMEDIATE ANXIETY AND JOINT PAIN IN PATIENTS WITH CF.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
20 2251  22 THE MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC TINNITUS--COMPARISON OF A COGNITIVE-BEHAVIOURAL GROUP TRAINING WITH YOGA. TWO NON-MEDICAL TREATMENT STRATEGIES FOR CHRONIC IDIOPATHIC TINNITUS WERE EVALUATED IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROL GROUP DESIGN. A COGNITIVE-BEHAVIOURAL TINNITUS COPING TRAINING (TCT) WAS DEVELOPED AND COMPARED TO YOGA AND A SELF-MONITORING CONTROL CONDITION. FORTY-THREE CHRONIC TINNITUS PATIENTS, WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE, DIRECTLY AFTER THERAPY, AND AT 3 MONTHS FOLLOW-UP. FOR EVALUATION, DIFFERENTIAL PSYCHOACOUSTIC VARIABLES WERE REGISTERED, A TINNITUS DIARY AS WELL AS THE TINNITUS QUESTIONNAIRE AND DIFFERENT MEASURES OF GENERAL WELL-BEING WERE USED. STATISTICAL ANALYSES SHOWED EFFECTS FAVOURING THE TCT TREATMENT IN COMPARISON TO THE CONTROL AND YOGA TREATMENT. THE TCT-TREATED PATIENTS REPORTED MORE SATISFACTION WITH THE TRAINING THAN THE YOGA GROUP. PARTICIPANTS IN THE SELF-MONITORING CONTROL GROUP WERE TREATED EITHER BY TCT OR YOGA AFTER A WAITING PERIOD. THE OUTCOME IN THIS GROUP WAS EVEN BETTER THAN IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS WHILE YOGA AGAIN SHOWED RATHER POOR EFFECTS.	1995

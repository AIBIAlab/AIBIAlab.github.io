1 2475 94 YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT FOR MANAGEMENT OF OPIOID DEPENDENCE SYNDROME: A NINE-MONTH FOLLOW-UP CASE REPORT. OPIOID DEPENDENCE SYNDROME (ODS) IS A CHRONIC RELAPSING REMITTING CONDITION ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT AND MORTALITY RISK. OPIOID SUBSTITUTION THERAPY IS USED WORLDWIDE, BUT LONG-TERM RETENTION RATES ARE LOW AND THERE IS RISK OF MISUSE AND DIVERSION. YOGA PRACTICE CAN IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE, REDUCE CHRONIC PAIN, AND ENHANCE ENDOGENOUS OPIOIDS (BETA-ENDORPHINS). WE DESCRIBE A CASE OF ODS WHERE YOGA WAS ADDED TO THE CONVENTIONAL MANAGEMENT AND WHO WAS FOLLOWED UP FOR 9 MONTHS. ASSESSMENTS WERE DONE FOR CLINICAL SYMPTOMS, URINE DRUG SCREENING, PLASMA BETA-ENDORPHINS, AND BUPRENORPHINE DOSAGE. WE OBSERVED AN IMPROVEMENT IN HIS CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND REDUCTION IN THE REQUIREMENTS FOR BUPRENORPHINE. A SLIGHT INCREASE IN BASAL PLASMA BETA-ENDORPHIN LEVELS WAS ALSO OBSERVED AT THE 9-MONTH FOLLOW-UP (FROM 2.02 PMOL/L AT BASELINE TO 6.51 PMOL/L).	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
2 1356 23 IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF TWO YOGA-BASED RELAXATION TECHNIQUES ON COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM RELAPSING REMITTING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: A COMPARATIVE STUDY. COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT (CI) IS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF RELAPSING REMITTING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (RRMS). YOGIC RELAXATION TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN FOUND USEFUL IN IMPROVING VARIOUS COGNITIVE DOMAINS IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. EIGHTEEN SUBJECTS (13 FEMALES) IN THE AGE RANGE OF 51.5 +/- 12.72 YEARS WITH THE DIAGNOSIS OF RRMS BY A NEUROLOGIST (MCDONALD CRITERIA 2010) SINCE LAST 18.16 +/- 12.59 YEARS WERE RECRUITED INTO THE STUDY FROM A NEURO-REHABILITATION CENTRE IN GERMANY. ASSESSMENTS WERE DONE BEFORE AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER TWO RANDOMLY ALLOCATED 30-MIN SESSIONS OF YOGIC RELAXATION: CYCLIC MEDITATION (CM) AND SR (SUPINE REST OR SHAVASANA). ASSESSMENTS WERE DONE FOR ATTENTION, PSYCHOMOTOR PERFORMANCE, INFORMATION PROCESSING SPEED, EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS, AND IMMEDIATE AND DELAYED RECALL USING STANDARD PSYCHOMETRIC TOOLS. RMANOVA WAS APPLIED TO ANALYSE THE DATA USING SPSS VERSION 10. BOTH CM AND SR SESSIONS IMPROVED SCORES ON DIGIT SYMBOL SUBSTITUTION TEST (DSST) (P < 0.01) AND AUDITORY VERBAL LEARNING TEST (AVLT) (P < 0.05). THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER PERFORMANCE IN TRAIL MAKING TEST (TMT)-A AND FORWARD DIGIT SPAN (FDS) AFTER CM AS COMPARED TO SR (P < 0.01). YOGIC RELAXATION TECHNIQUES MAY HAVE AN IMMEDIATE ENHANCING EFFECT ON PROCESSING SPEED, PSYCHOMOTOR PERFORMANCE, AND RECALL OF RRMS PATIENTS. CM IS BETTER THAN SR IN IMPROVING PROCESSING SPEED, SHORT-TERM MEMORY, AND VERBAL WORKING MEMORY.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
3 2697 24 YOGA INTERVENTION AND FUNCTIONAL PAIN SYNDROMES: A SELECTIVE REVIEW. THE DEFINITION OF FUNCTIONAL PAIN SYNDROMES IS VARIED ACROSS LITERATURE. NO EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE TO SEE ALL FUNCTIONAL PAIN DISORDER GROUPS UNDER BROAD NOMENCLATURE WHICH WOULD EXCLUDE CONDITIONS FOR WHICH PATHOPHYSIOLOGY IS STRONGLY KNOWN. SINCE THESE DISORDERS ARE COMMONLY TREATED WITH ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT MODALITIES AND IMPOSE SIGNIFICANT BURDEN ON HEALTH UTILIZATION, AN EFFORT TO LOOK INTO STUDIES ON YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ON 'FUNCTIONAL PAIN SYNDROMES' (FPS) WAS MADE. THIS STUDY DEFINED FPS AS 'CHRONIC RELAPSING REMITTING PAIN CONDITIONS, THE ORIGIN OF WHICH IS DIFFICULT TO TRACE WITH NO DEFINITE PHYSICAL PATHOLOGY ON CLINICAL SUSPICION OR AVAILABLE LABORATORY MEASURES AND ARE VALID BASED ON SUBJECTIVE PAIN REPORTING, ASSOCIATED DISTRESS AND SOCIO-OCCUPATIONAL DYSFUNCTION'. CHRONIC HEADACHE, NECK PAIN, BACK PAIN, FIBROMYALGIA, PELVIC PAIN, IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME, CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME, AND SOMATOFORM PAIN DISORDERS WERE INCLUDED FOR THIS REVIEW. THE REVIEW FOUND FOUR META-ANALYSES ON THE SELECTED TOPIC BOTH INDICATING MODEST EFFICACY AND BENEFIT OF YOGA IN THESE DISORDERS. FUTURE EFFORTS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO DO A LARGE META-ANALYSIS OF FUNCTIONAL PAIN SYNDROMES.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
4 2780 31 YOGA THERAPY AND AMBULATORY MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS ASSESSMENT OF GAIT ANALYSIS PARAMETERS, FATIGUE AND BALANCE. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: GAIT IMPAIRMENT, FALLS DUE TO BALANCE PROBLEMS AND FATIGUE ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPLAINTS IN PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) AND CAUSE SIGNIFICANT FUNCTIONAL LIMITATION. USE OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE (CAM) TO HELP SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT AND TO IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE IS GROWING AMONG MS PATIENTS. YOGA IS WIDELY USED AS ONE OF THESE CAM INTERVENTIONS, HOWEVER, THE NUMBER OF STUDIES THAT SHOW THE EFFICACY OF YOGA TRAINING IN MS IS INADEQUATE. IN THIS STUDY, WE AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF A SHORT TERM YOGA PROGRAM ON FATIGUE, BALANCE AND GAIT IN PATIENTS WITH MS. METHOD: EIGHT VOLUNTEER AMBULATORY MS PATIENTS WITH CLINICALLY DEFINITE RELAPSING REMITTING MS WHOSE EXPANDED DISABILITY STATUS SCORE (EDSS) IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 6.0, AND EIGHT HEALTHY SUBJECTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. PATIENTS PARTICIPATED IN 12 WEEKS OF A BI-WEEKLY YOGA PROGRAM UNDER SUPERVISION. AT THEIR BASELINE AND AFTER YOGA THERAPY, THE FATIGUE SEVERITY SCALE (FSS) AND BERG BALANCE SCALE (BBS) ARE USED TO ASSESS FATIGUE AND BALANCE. THREE DIMENSIONAL GAIT ANALYSIS IS DONE USING THE VICON 612 SYSTEM WITH SIX CAMERAS AND TWO BERTEC FORCE PLATES, BEFORE AND AFTER THERAPY. RESULTS: AFTER SHORT TERM YOGA THERAPY, STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS WERE OBTAINED IN FATIGUE, BALANCE, STEP LENGTH AND WALKING SPEED. ALTHOUGH SAGITTAL PLANE PELVIS AND HIP ANGLES, ANKLE PLANTAR FLEXOR MOMENT, POWERS GENERATED AT THE HIP AND ANKLE JOINTS AT THE PRE-SWING WERE IMPROVED, THE IMPROVEMENTS WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. CONCLUSION: YOGA THERAPY IS A SAFE AND BENEFICIAL INTERVENTION FOR IMPROVING FATIGUE, BALANCE AND SPATIOTEMPORAL GAIT PARAMETERS IN PATIENTS WITH MS. FURTHER STUDIES WITH A LARGER SAMPLE SIZE AND LONGER FOLLOW-UP WILL BE NEEDED TO EVALUATE THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                              
5  746 26 EFFECT OF SAHAJ YOGA ON NEURO-COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM MAJOR DEPRESSION. COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS ARE IMPAIRED IN MAJOR DEPRESSION. STUDIES ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS HAVE SHOWN IMPROVEMENT IN MEMORY, VIGILANCE AND ANXIETY LEVELS. 30 PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM MAJOR DEPRESSION (AGE 18 TO 45 YEARS) WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: GROUP 1: (10 MALES AND 5 FEMALES) PATIENTS WHO PRACTISED SAHAJ YOGA MEDITATION AND ALSO RECEIVED CONVENTIONAL ANTI-DEPRESSANT MEDICATION. GROUP 2: (9 MALES AND 6 FEMALES) PATIENTS WHO ONLY RECEIVED CONVENTIONAL ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATION. GROUP 1 PATIENTS WERE ADMINISTERED SAHAJ YOGA PRACTICE FOR 8 WEEKS. NEURO-COGNITIVE TEST BATTERY CONSISTING OF LETTER CANCELLATION TEST (LCT), TRAIL MAKING TEST 'A' (TTA), TRAIL MAKING TEST 'B' (TTB), RUFF FIGURAL FLUENCY TEST (RFFT), FORWARD DIGIT SPAN (FDS) & REVERSE DIGIT SPAN TEST (RDS) WAS USED TO ASSESS FOLLOWING COGNITIVE DOMAINS: ATTENTION SPAN, VISUO-MOTOR SPEED, SHORT-TERM MEMORY, WORKING MEMORY AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS. AFTER 8 WEEKS, BOTH GROUP 1 AND GROUP 2 SUBJECTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN LCT, TTA & TTB BUT IMPROVEMENT IN LCT WAS MORE MARKED IN GROUP 1 SUBJECTS. ALSO, THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN RDS SCORES IN ONLY GROUP 1 SUBJECTS (P < 0.05). THE RESULTS THEREBY, DEMONSTRATE THAT SAHAJ YOGA PRACTICE IN ADDITION TO THE IMPROVEMENT IN VARIOUS OTHER COGNITIVE DOMAINS SEEN WITH CONVENTIONAL ANTI-DEPRESSANTS, CAN LEAD TO ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENT IN EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS LIKE MANIPULATION OF INFORMATION IN THE VERBAL WORKING MEMORY AND ADDED IMPROVEMENT IN ATTENTION SPAN AND VISUO-MOTOR SPEED OF THE DEPRESSIVES.	2006	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
6 2490 19 YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION TO MANAGE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS SYMPTOMS. MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) IS AN AUTOIMMUNE, DEMYELINATING, INFLAMMATORY DISEASE OF CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) WHICH IS CHARACTERIZED BY SPASTICITY, FATIGUE, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, BOWEL AND BLADDER DYSFUNCTION, IMPAIRED MOBILITY, COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT ETC. AND AFFECTS APPROXIMATELY 2.5 MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE. DISEASE MODIFYING THERAPIES FOR MS WHICH HELP IN PREVENTING ACCUMULATION OF LESIONS IN WHITE MATTER OF CNS ARE COSTLY AND HAVE SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECTS. THEREFORE, PATIENTS WITH MS ARE USING COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE (CAM) AND YOGA IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR FORM OF CAM WHICH IS BEING USED IMMENSELY TO REDUCE OR OVERCOME THE SYMPTOMS OF MS. IN THE CURRENT REVIEW ATTEMPTED TO PRESENT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF YOGA PRACTICES ON REDUCING MS RELATED SYMPTOMS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
7 1396 18 IMPACT OF YOGA IN A CASE OF VOCAL CORD DYSFUNCTION WITH DYSAUTONOMIA. A 23-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH A PAST MEDICAL HISTORY OF GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE PRESENTED WITH SHORTNESS OF BREATH INDUCED BY EXERCISE AND CERTAIN ODORS. SHE REPORTED THE SYMPTOMS OF AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION INCLUDING FATIGUE, CHEST PAIN, LIGHTHEADEDNESS, HEADACHES, NUMBNESS/TINGLING IN THE ARMS AND LEGS, AND EXERCISE INTOLERANCE. VITAL SIGNS WERE SIGNIFICANT FOR ORTHOSTATIC INTOLERANCE. VOLUME FLOW LOOP IN THE PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS SHOWED A FLATTENING OF THE INSPIRATORY PORTION CHARACTERISTIC OF VOCAL CORD DYSFUNCTION.

8 2300 20 THERAPEUTIC YOGA: SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) IS THE MOST COMMON AUTOIMMUNE INFLAMMATORY DEMYELINATING DISEASE OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM, AFFECTING OVER 2.3 MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE, THE AGE OF DISEASE ONSET IS TYPICALLY BETWEEN 20 AND 40 YEARS, WITH A HIGHER INCIDENCE IN WOMEN. INDIVIDUALS WITH MS EXPERIENCE A WIDE RANGE OF SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING DECLINING PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS (E.G., FATIGUE, IMBALANCE, SPASTICITY, CHRONIC PAIN, COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, BLADDER AND BOWEL DYSFUNCTION, VISUAL AND SPEECH IMPAIRMENTS, DEPRESSION, SENSORY DISTURBANCE, AND MOBILITY IMPAIRMENT). TO DATE, BOTH THE CAUSE OF AND CURE FOR MS REMAIN UNKNOWN. IN RECENT YEARS, MORE INDIVIDUALS WITH MS HAVE BEEN PURSUING ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF TREATMENT TO MANAGE SYMPTOMS OF THE DISEASE, INCLUDING MIND-BODY THERAPIES SUCH AS YOGA, MEDITATION, BREATHING, AND RELAXATION TECHNIQUES. IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT THE PRACTICE OF YOGA MAY BE A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE WAY OF MANAGING SYMPTOMS OF MS. THEREFORE, THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO SUMMARIZE THE MOST RELEVANT LITERATURE ON EXERCISE AND MIND-BODY MODALITIES TO TREAT MS SYMPTOMS AND, MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE BENEFITS AND POTENTIAL ROLE OF YOGA AS AN ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT OF SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH MS. THE ARTICLE ALSO DISCUSSES FUTURE DIRECTIONS FOR RESEARCH.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
9 2224 25 THE IMPACT OF THE "YOGIC LIFESTYLE" ON CANCER PROGNOSIS AND SURVIVAL: CAN WE TARGET CANCER STEM CELLS WITH YOGA? CANCER HAS RECENTLY BEEN KNOWN TO ORIGINATE FROM STEM CELL-LIKE CELLS, CALLED CANCER STEM CELLS (CSCS). THEIR UNIQUE PROPERTIES OF SELF-DUPLICATION, MULTIPLICATION, AS WELL AS MIGRATION GIVE THE CSC RESISTANCE OVER CONVENTIONAL CANCER THERAPIES. NEWER THERAPIES ARE IN DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE TO TARGET THESE STEM CELL-LIKE POPULATIONS AND BECOME THE VANGUARD OF FUTURE TREATMENTS. SEVERAL COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS HAVE BEEN USED IN CANCER MANAGEMENT AS AN ADJUNCT TO CONVENTIONAL THERAPY TO IMPROVE THE OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE AND REDUCE RECURRENCE. YOGA STANDS AS THE THIRD MOST POPULAR OF ALL COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE TREATMENTS CURRENTLY USED IN CANCER PATIENTS TODAY. PRELIMINARY RESULTS SHOW THAT YOGA MODULATES NEURAL, HORMONAL, AND IMMUNE FUNCTIONS AT A CELLULAR LEVEL. THE SCOPE OF THIS COMMENTARY IS TO DISCUSS THE CURRENT EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE ON YOGA AND ITS EFFECT ON CSCS.	2017

11  422 20 BRIDGING THE SCHISM OF SCHIZOPHRENIA THROUGH YOGA-REVIEW OF PUTATIVE MECHANISMS. SCHIZOPHRENIA PATIENTS EXPERIENCE A 'DISCONNECT' AT MULTIPLE LEVELS-NEURONAL NETWORKS, MENTAL PROCESSES, AND INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS. THE RESULTANT POOR QUALITY-OF-LIFE AND FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY ARE RELATED TO THE PERSISTENT COGNITIVE DEFICITS AND NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS, WHICH ARE RATHER RESISTANT TO CONVENTIONAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDICATIONS. YOGA HAS EMERGED AS AN IMPORTANT THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE QUALITY-OF-LIFE IN SCHIZOPHRENIA. RECENT PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT EFFECTS OF YOGA ON COGNITIVE AND NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS MAY DRIVE THIS BENEFIT. THIS STUDY ATTEMPTS TO INTEGRATE EVIDENCE FROM NEUROSCIENCE-BASED RESEARCH, WHICH FOCUSES ON THE NEUROPLASTICITY-HARNESSING EFFECTS OF YOGA TO BRIDGE THE SCHIZOPHRENIA CONNECTOPATHY. IN AN OVERARCHING MODEL TO STUDY PUTATIVE NEUROBIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS THAT DRIVE THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF YOGA, IT IS PROPOSED THAT (A) VARIOUS STYLES OF MEDITATION MAY HELP IN STRENGTHENING THE LATERAL AND MEDIAL PREFRONTAL BRAIN NETWORKS, THUS IMPROVING NEUROCOGNITION AND MENTALIZING ABILITIES, AND (B) LEARNING AND PERFORMING CO-ORDINATED PHYSICAL POSTURES WITH A TEACHER FACILITATES IMITATION AND THE PROCESS OF BEING IMITATED, WHICH CAN IMPROVE SOCIAL COGNITION AND EMPATHY THROUGH REINFORCEMENT OF THE PREMOTOR AND PARIETAL MIRROR NEURON SYSTEM. OXYTOCIN MAY PLAY A ROLE IN MEDIATING THESE PROCESSES, LEADING TO BETTER SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS AND SOCIAL OUTCOMES. CLINICAL AND HEURISTIC IMPLICATIONS OF THIS MODEL ARE FURTHER DISCUSSED.	2016

13 1525 23 IYENGAR YOGA AND THE USE OF PROPS FOR PEDIATRIC CHRONIC PAIN: A CASE STUDY. IYENGAR YOGA USES POSTURES AND PROPS TO SUPPORT THE BODY SO THAT PRACTITIONERS CAN ENGAGE IN POSES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE MORE DIFFICULT. THIS TYPE OF YOGA MAY BE USEFUL IN TREATING CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WHO HAVE CHRONIC PAIN AND DISABILITY. IN THIS CASE STUDY, THE AUTHORS DISCUSS A 14-Y-OLD GIRL WHO HAD TWO SURGERIES FOR GASTRO-ESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE (GERD) AND WHO HAD CONTINUED CHEST AND ABDOMINAL PAIN, AS WELL AS VOMITING, DIFFICULTY EATING, WEIGHT LOSS, AND ANXIETY. HAVING SIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIRED FUNCTIONING, SHE WAS UNABLE TO ATTEND SCHOOL, SLEEP, SOCIALIZE, OR EAT, AND SHE HAD BECOME WHEELCHAIR-BOUND. DESPITE EVALUATIONS AND TREATMENTS BY SPECIALISTS OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, HER SYMPTOMS HAD NOT IMPROVED. THIS CASE HISTORY DESCRIBES HOW THE AUTHORS USED A 4-MO TREATMENT OF IYENGAR YOGA TO HELP THE ADOLESCENT RESUME ACTIVITIES AND RE-ENGAGE WITH HER ENVIRONMENT. THE AUTHORS INTEND THIS REPORT TO STIMULATE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF THIS FORM OF TREATMENT FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH CHRONIC PAIN.	2013

15   82 20 A MECHANISTIC MODEL FOR YOGA AS A PREVENTIVE AND THERAPEUTIC MODALITY. YOGA IS AN ANCIENT INDIAN TECHNIQUE OF HEALTHY LIVING. NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE CORROBORATED YOGA'S BENEFICIAL EFFECTS, INCLUDING A FAVORABLE INFLUENCE ON AUTONOMIC FUNCTION AND NEGATIVE EMOTIONS. EXTENSIVE RESEARCH IN THE LAST FEW DECADES HAS REVEALED THE CRITICAL ROLE THAT YOGA CAN PLAY IN ERADICATING STRESS. THIS HAS LAID TO THE FOUNDATION FOR A SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES ATTRIBUTED TO STRESS, PARTICULARLY AT THE MOLECULAR AND GENETIC LEVELS. THIS PRIMARILY HAS HELPED UNDERSTAND THE EPIGENETIC AND GENETIC MECHANISM AT PLAY TO INDUCE AND ALLEVIATE STRESS, PARTICULARLY THOSE RELATED TO EMOTIONAL ABERRATIONS. AS RESEARCH HAS INDICATED, NEGATIVE EMOTIONS ARE TRANSLATED INTO VASCULAR INFLAMMATION APPROPRIATELY ACCENTUATED BY A SYMPATHETIC PREDOMINANT AUTONOMIC FUNCTION. THIS CASCADE IS BOLSTERED BY MULTIPLE FACTORS, INCLUDING ACTIVATION OF "STRESSOR" GENES AND ELABORATING HORMONES, INCLUDING STEROIDS WITH SOMETIMES NOCUOUS CONSEQUENCES, PARTICULARLY WHEN CHRONIC. YOGA HAS BEEN CATEGORICALLY FOUND TO HAVE INHIBITED EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THESE BANEFUL EFFECTS OF STRESS. IN FACT, IT ALSO CHANGES THE NEURONAL CIRCUITS THAT POTENTIATE SUCH A PLETHORA OF PATHOLOGICAL CHANGES. THIS, IN TURN, HAS ACCENTUATED YOGA'S RELEVANCE AS A POWERFUL PREVENTIVE INTERVENTION IN NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES (NCD). NCDS, INCLUDING HEART DISEASE, STROKE, AND RHEUMATOLOGICAL DISORDERS, ARE ESSENTIALLY INFLAMMATORY DISEASES THAT PERPETUATE INFLAMMATION IN DIFFERENT BEDS LIKE VASCULAR OR JOINT SPACES. THE PRECISE MECHANISM BY WHICH YOGA INDUCES SUCH BENEFICIAL CHANGES IS YET TO BE DELINEATED. HOWEVER, A CORNUCOPIA OF POINTERS INDICATES THAT NEURAL, ENDOCRINE, IMMUNOLOGICAL, CELLULAR, GENETIC, AND EPIGENETIC MECHANISMS ARE AT PLAY. THIS ARTICLE ATTEMPTS TO COBBLE TOGETHER NEWFANGLED RESEARCH TO DELINEATE A MEDICAL MODEL FOR THIS 5000-YEAR-OLD PRACTICE FROM INDIA. THIS IS IMPERATIVE, AS A MECHANISTIC MODEL OF THIS ANCIENT-BUT-COMPLEX SYSTEM WOULD ENABLE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF ITS MECHANISM AND REVEAL ITS YET-UNDISCOVERED POSITIVE HEALTH EFFECTS.	2021	

16  538 15 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT FOR NECK PAIN: CHIROPRACTIC, ACUPUNCTURE, TENS, MASSAGE, YOGA, TAI CHI, AND FELDENKRAIS. OF THE MULTITUDE OF TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF NECK PAIN, NO OBVIOUS SINGLE TREATMENT MODALITY HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE MOST EFFICACIOUS. AS SUCH, THE CLINICIAN SHOULD CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT MODALITIES IF A MODALITY IS ENGAGING, AVAILABLE, FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE, POTENTIALLY EFFICACIOUS, AND IS LOW RISK FOR THE PATIENT. AS EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE FOR NECK PAIN DEVELOPS, THE CLINICIAN IS FACED WITH THE CHALLENGE OF WHICH TREATMENTS TO ENCOURAGE PATIENTS TO PURSUE. TREATMENT MODALITIES EXPLORED IN THIS ARTICLE, INCLUDING CHIROPRACTIC, ACUPUNCTURE, TENS, MASSAGE, YOGA, TAI CHI, AND FELDENKRAIS, REPRESENT REASONABLE COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE METHODS FOR PATIENTS WITH NECK PAIN.	2011

18 2460 21 YOGA AS A METHOD OF SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) IS AN IMMUNE-MEDIATED PROCESS IN WHICH THE BODY'S IMMUNE SYSTEM DAMAGES MYELIN IN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS). THE ONSET OF THIS DISORDER TYPICALLY OCCURS IN YOUNG ADULTS, AND IT IS MORE COMMON AMONG WOMEN. CURRENTLY, THERE IS NO CURE AND THE LONG-TERM DISEASE PROGRESSION MAKES SYMPTOMATIC MANAGEMENT CRITICAL FOR MAINTAINING QUALITY OF LIFE. SEVERAL PHARMACOTHERAPEUTIC AGENTS ARE APPROVED FOR TREATMENT, BUT MANY PATIENTS SEEK COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE INTERVENTIONS. REVIEWS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED REGARDING BROAD TOPICS SUCH AS MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR PEOPLE DIAGNOSED WITH MS AND THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON A RANGE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PRESENT REVIEW IS TO EXAMINE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH MS AND ADDRESS ITS USE IN MANAGING SYMPTOMS INCLUDING PAIN, MENTAL HEALTH, FATIGUE, SPASTICITY, BALANCE, BLADDER CONTROL, AND SEXUAL FUNCTION.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
19 2501 28 YOGA AS THERAPY FOR NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS: A CASE REPORT OF THERAPEUTIC YOGA FOR ADRENOMYELONEUROPATHY. YOGA IS A PROMISING THERAPEUTIC MODALITY FOR NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES. THIS CASE STUDY PRESENTS A THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROTOCOL FOR ADRENOMYELONEUROPATHY (AMN) AND ITS EFFECT ON A PATIENT'S QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), AGILITY, BALANCE, AND PERIPHERAL DEXTERITY. A 61-Y-OLD MAN DIAGNOSED WITH AMN WHO WAS EXPERIENCING (1) PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY IN HIS LEGS AND FEET, (2) LOWER-BACK PAIN (LBP), AND (3) OSTEOARTHRITIS RECEIVED 60-MIN WEEKLY THERAPEUTIC YOGA SESSIONS FOR A 10-MO PERIOD. YOGA THERAPY INCLUDED HATHA YOGA ASANAS (POSES) AND PRANAYAMA (BREATHING EXERCISES). HATHA YOGA ASANAS WERE ALIGNED WITH 7 BERG BALANCE SCALE (BBS) INDICATORS TO MEASURE IMPROVEMENT IN BALANCE AND RANGE OF MOTION. THE 10-MO COURSE OF THERAPEUTIC YOGA RESULTED IN IMPROVED LBP; IMPROVED FLEXION OF THE PATIENT'S HIPS, KNEES, AND ANKLES; IMPROVED PROPULSION PHASE OF WALKING; AND IMPROVEMENT IN THE PATIENT'S ABILITY TO STAND AND BALANCE WITHOUT AN ASSISTIVE DEVICE. THE EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY ON THE PATIENT IN THIS CASE STUDY ALIGNS WITH CURRENT QOL IMPROVEMENTS NOTED IN CURRENT RESEARCH ON YOGA THERAPY FOR NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS. THE DESCRIBED CONCEPTS AND METHODS OF EMPLOYING THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROVIDE INSIGHTS FOR CLINICIANS INTO A MODALITY THAT IS LOW RISK AND LOW COST AND THAT CAN SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS WITH OTHER NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS, SUCH AS MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS), FIBROMYALGIA (FM), AND DISEASES OF THE PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. FURTHER STUDY IS WARRANTED TO HELP DETERMINE THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF YOGA THERAPY FOR THESE CONDITIONS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
20 1887 20 REFLECTIONS ON CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF YOGA IN VOICE THERAPY WITH MTD. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE APPLICATION OF MODIFIED YOGA TECHNIQUES, AS AN ADJUNCT TO VOICE THERAPY, BY A SPEECH PATHOLOGIST WHO IS ALSO A YOGA TEACHER. YOGA PRACTICES, WITH EFFECTS THAT MAY BE SHORT-TERM, ARE NOT CONSIDERED A SUBSTITUTE FOR COMPREHENSIVE AND INTEGRATED SOMATIC RETRAINING SYSTEMS (SUCH AS THE ALEXANDER TECHNIQUE OR FELDENKRAIS ATM). HOWEVER, WHEN YOGA IS CONDUCTED EMPHASIZING KINAESTHETIC AND PROPRIOCEPTIVE AWARENESS, THE CLIENT MAY ACHIEVE AN 'AWARENESS STATE' THAT FACILITATES THE LEARNING OF VOCAL REMEDIATION TECHNIQUES (FOR EXAMPLE, BY MORE EASILY 'TUNING IN' TO THE SUBTLE SENSATIONS OF SUPRALARYNGEAL DECONSTRICTION). CORE YOGA ELEMENTS AND CLINICAL APPLICATIONS ARE IDENTIFIED. THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS AND CONSIDERATIONS WHEN USING YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT TO THE TREATMENT OF MUSCLE TENSION DYSPHONIA (MTD) ARE EXPLORED.	2012

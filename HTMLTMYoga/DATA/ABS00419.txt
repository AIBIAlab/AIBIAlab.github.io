1  419 213 BREATHING-FOCUSED YOGA INTERVENTION ON RESPIRATORY DECLINE IN CHRONICALLY PESTICIDE-EXPOSED FARMERS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO PESTICIDES HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH LUNG AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION EXACERBATIONS. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WE TESTED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BREATHING FOCUSED YOGA INTERVENTION ON ALLEVIATION OF ADVERSE RESPIRATORY AND COGNITIVE EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH CHRONIC PESTICIDE EXPOSURE IN FARMERS. METHODS: WE UNDERTOOK A PARALLEL, TWO-ARMED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH BLINDED OUTCOME ASSESSORS ON A CHRONICALLY PESTICIDE-EXPOSED FARMING POPULATION. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT DISTRICT PANIPAT, STATE HARYANA LOCATED IN THE NORTHERN PART OF INDIA FROM NOVEMBER 2019 TO AUGUST 2020. A TOTAL OF 634 FARMERS WERE SCREENED, AND 140 FARMERS WERE RANDOMIZED TO BREATHING-FOCUSED YOGA INTERVENTION (BFY, N = 70) AND WAITLIST CONTROL ARMS (N = 65). BFY WAS DELIVERED WEEKLY IN 45-MIN GROUP SESSIONS OVER 12 WEEKS FOLLOWED BY HOME-BASED PRACTICE. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS THE CHANGE IN SPIROMETRY-BASED MARKERS OF PULMONARY FUNCTION FROM BASELINE EXPRESSED AS RAW VALUES, GLOBAL LUNG INITIATIVE (GLI) PERCENT PREDICTED (PP), AND GLI Z-SCORES AFTER 24 WEEKS OF INTERVENTION. SECONDARY VARIABLES WERE TRAIL MAKING TESTS (TMT A AND B), DIGIT SYMBOL SUBSTITUTION (DSST), AND WHO QUALITY OF LIFE-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF). ANALYSIS WAS BY INTENTION-TO-TREAT. MEDIATION ANALYSIS WAS DONE CONSIDERING OXIDATIVE STRESS MARKERS AS POTENTIAL MEDIATORS. RESULTS: AT THE END OF 6 MONTHS OF INTERVENTION, THE OVERALL FOLLOW-UP IN THE PARTICIPANTS WAS 87.85% (N = 123); 90% (N = 63) IN THE CONTROL GROUP, AND 85.71% IN THE YOGA GROUP (N = 60). THE MEAN AGE OF THE STUDY COHORT (N = 140) WAS 38.75 (SD = 7.50) YEARS. COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP, AT 24 WEEKS POST-INTERVENTION, THE BFY GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED STATUS OF THE RAW SAND Z SCORES MARKERS OF AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION, AFTER ADJUSTING FOR CONFOUNDERS, FEV1, FVC, FEF25-75 [Z SCORE-ADJUSTED MEAN DIFFERENCES (95% CI); 1.66 (1.10-2.21) 1.88 (1.21-2.55), AND 6.85 (5.12-8.57), RESPECTIVELY. A FRACTION OF FEF25-75 CHANGE (MEDIATION PERCENTAGE 23.95%) WAS EXPLAINED BY GLUTATHIONE AUGMENTATION. THERE WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN COGNITIVE SCORES OF DSST, TMT-A AND TMT-B, AND WHOQOL-BREF. CONCLUSION: IN CONCLUSION, REGULAR PRACTICE OF BFY COULD IMPROVE THE EXACERBATIONS IN THE MARKERS OF AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION IN CHRONICALLY PESTICIDE-EXPOSED FARMERS AND COGNITIVE VARIABLES. A SIGNIFICANT MEDIATING EFFECT OF GLUTATHIONE AUGMENTATION WAS ALSO OBSERVED CONCERNING THE EFFECT OF THE INTERVENTION ON FEF25-75. THESE FINDINGS PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF BENEFICIAL EVIDENCE OF THE BREATHING-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION THAT NEEDS VALIDATION ACROSS DIFFERENT FARMING ETHNICITIES.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION:WWW.CLINICALTRIALS.GOV, IDENTIFIER: CTRI/2019/11/021989.	2022

MATERIAL AND METHOD: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED BETWEEN MAY AND AUGUST 2020 AS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. 'PERSONAL INFORMATION FORM', 'RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS MONITORING FORM', 'COPD AND ASTHMA FATIGUE SCALE (CAFS), "ASTHMA AND COPD SLEEP IMPACT SCALE (CASIS)" AND MODIFIED MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL DYSPNEA SCALE (MMRC) WERE USED IN DATA COLLECTION. RESULTS: WHEN THE POST-TEST MEAN SCORES OF THE PATIENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUP WERE COMPARED, IT WAS FOUND THAT CAFS, CASIS AND MMRC MEAN SCORES OF THE PATIENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP DECREASED POSITIVELY COMPARED TO THE PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WAS FOUND TO BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: YOGA HAS BEEN FOUND TO REDUCE THE SEVERITY OF DYSPNEA AND FATIGUE AND IMPROVE SLEEP QUALITY IN CHRONIC RESPIRATORY DISEASES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
3 2653  53 YOGA IMPROVES OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE, DEPRESSION, AND DAILY ACTIVITIES FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC PAIN IS A COMPLEX ACCUMULATION OF PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS, THUS INTERVENTIONS THAT ADDRESS PAIN AND PROMOTE OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE ARE NEEDED. A HOLISTIC INTERVENTION, WITH MIND AND BODY COMPONENTS, IS LIKELY NECESSARY TO BEST TREAT THE COMPLEXITIES OF CHRONIC PAIN. THUS, WE DEVELOPED AND TESTED A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN. OBJECTIVES: IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL (RCT), PARTICIPANTS WITH CHRONIC PAIN WERE RANDOMIZED TO A YOGA INTERVENTION OR USUAL CARE GROUP. BETWEEN AND WITHIN GROUP DIFFERENCES FOR PRE-AND POST-OUTCOME MEASURE SCORES WERE ASSESSED FOR: OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE, COMPLETION OF ACTIVITIES, AND DEPRESSION. METHODS: PILOT RCT WITH PARTICIPANT ALLOCATION TO 8 WEEKS OF YOGA OR USUAL CARE. BOTH GROUPS RECEIVED ONGOING MONTHLY SELF-MANAGEMENT PROGRAMMING. DATA WERE COLLECTED BEFORE AND AFTER THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA OR USUAL CARE AFTER BASELINE ASSESSMENTS. DEMOGRAPHICS WERE COLLECTED AND MEASURES INCLUDED: CANADIAN OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE MEASURE (COPM) TO ASSESS OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE; THE 15-ITEM FRENCHAY ACTIVITIES INDEX (FAI)(ACTIVITIES); AND THE 9-ITEM PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE (PHQ-9) FOR DEPRESSION. INDEPENDENT T-TESTS WERE USED TO ASSESS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS. PAIRED T-TESTS WERE USED TO ASSESS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRE- AND POST 8-WEEK INTERVENTION FOR BOTH THE YOGA AND THE USUAL CARE GROUPS. PERCENT CHANGE SCORES AND EFFECT SIZES WERE CALCULATED. RESULTS: 83 PEOPLE WERE RECRUITED FOR THE STUDY AND COMPLETED BASELINE ASSESSMENTS; 44 INDIVIDUALS WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA AND 39 TO THE CONTROL GROUP. THE AVERAGE AGE OF ALL PARTICIPANTS WAS 51.4+/-10.5 YEARS, 68% WERE FEMALE; AND 60% HAD AT LEAST SOME COLLEGE EDUCATION. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN DEMOGRAPHICS OR OUTCOME MEASURES BETWEEN GROUPS AT BASELINE OR 8 WEEKS; HOWEVER, THE STUDY WAS NOT POWERED TO SEE SUCH DIFFERENCES. INDIVIDUALS RANDOMIZED TO THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE IN ANY OUTCOME MEASURE OVER THE 8 WEEKS. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN COPM PERFORMANCE AND COPM SATISFACTION SCORES FOR INDIVIDUALS RANDOMIZED TO THE YOGA GROUP; BOTH SCORES SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED. COPM PERFORMANCE IMPROVED BY 27% WITH A MODERATE TO LARGE EFFECT SIZE (3.66+/-1.85 VS 4.66+/-1.93, P < 0.001, D = 0.76). COPM SATISFACTION SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED BY 78% (2.14+/-2.31 VS. 3.80+/-2.50, P < 0.001) AND HAD A LARGE EFFECTS SIZE (D = 1.02). FAI SCORES IMPROVED, INDICATING INCREASED ACTIVITY OR ENGAGEMENT IN DAILY OCCUPATION DURING THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION. SCORES INCREASED BY 5% (38.13+/-8.48 VS. 39.90+/-8.57, P = 0.024) WITH A SMALL EFFECT SIZE (D = 0.37). DEPRESSION SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED FROM 13.21+/-5.60 TO 11.41+/-5.82, P = 0.041, WITH A SMALL EFFECT SIZE. CONCLUSION: DATA FROM THIS PILOT RCT INDICATE YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION WITH PEOPLE IN CHRONIC PAIN TO IMPROVE OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE, INCREASE ENGAGEMENT IN ACTIVITIES, AND DECREASE DEPRESSION. OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY PRACTITIONERS MAY CONSIDER ADDING YOGA AS A TREATMENT INTERVENTION TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH PAIN.	2019	

4  822  40 EFFECT OF YOGA ON FEV1, 6-MINUTE WALK DISTANCE (6-MWD) AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH COPD GROUP B. INTRODUCTION: YOGA IS USED IN THE TREATMENT OF VARIOUS DISEASES, INCLUDING CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE. HOWEVER, NO STUDIES HAVE ASSESSED THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON COPD PATIENTS IN INDONESIA. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS STUDY AND SIMILAR STUDIES COMPLETED IN OTHER COUNTRIES LIES IN THE TYPE OF YOGA EXERCISES COMPLETED, THE METHOD IN WHICH THEY WERE COMPLETED, AND IN CERTAIN, UNIQUE DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS. THIS STUDY AIMS TO ANALYZE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON FEV1, 6-MINUTE WALK DISTANCE, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH COPD GROUP B IN INDONESIA. MATERIAL AND METHODS: THIS ARTICLE REFLECTS RESEARCH DONE IN THE FORM OF AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY USING ARANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH PRE AND POST-TEST CONTROL GROUP DESIGN. THE SAMPLES WERE DIVIDED INTO 2 GROUPS: THE TREATMENT GROUP (YOGA PRACTICE FOR 1 HOUR, 2 TIMES AWEEK FOR 12 WEEKS) AND THE CONTROL GROUP (UNTREATED WITH YOGA, GIVEN LUNG REHABILITATION BROCHURE). ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECT OF YOGA EXERCISES ON LUNG FUNCTION PARAMETERS (FEV1), 6-MINUTE WALK DISTANCE AND QUALITY OF LIFE WERE USED USING SGRQ QUESTIONNAIRES IN COPD GROUP B. RESULTS: 33 COPD PATIENTS FULFILLED THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. 30 PATIENTS COMPLETED THE STUDY. PRE AND POST YOGA RESULTS WERE EVALU-ATED IN THE TREATMENT GROUP VERSUS THE CONTROL GROUP AND THEN FURTHER ASSESSED USING STATISTICAL TESTS. THERE WAS ASIGNIFICANT IN-CREASE IN FEV1, 6-MWD AND QUALITY OF LIFE USING ASGRQ QUESTIONNAIRE AFTER 12 WEEKS OF YOGA (P < 0.05) AS WELL AS AASIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN FEV1, 6-MWD AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE TREATMENT GROUP (P < 0.05) WHEN COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: YOGA AFFECTS FEV1, 6-MWD, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH GROUP B COPD.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
5  271  40 ADD-ON EFFECT OF HOT SAND FOMENTATION TO YOGA ON PAIN, DISABILITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN CHRONIC NECK PAIN PATIENTS. BACKGROUND: NECK PAIN IS ONE OF THE COMMONEST COMPLAINTS AND AN IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM ACROSS THE GLOBE. YOGA HAS REPORTED TO BE USEFUL FOR NECK PAIN AND HOT SAND HAS REPORTED TO BE USEFUL FOR CHRONIC RHEUMATISM. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO EVALUATE THE ADD-ON EFFECT OF HOT SAND FOMENTATION (HSF) TO YOGA ON PAIN, DISABILITY, QUALITY OF SLEEP (QOS) AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) OF THE PATIENTS WITH NON-SPECIFIC NECK PAIN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 60 SUBJECTS WITH NON-SPECIFIC OR COMMON NECK PAIN WERE RECRUITED AND RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO EITHER STUDY GROUP OR CONTROL GROUP. BOTH THE GROUPS HAVE RECEIVED YOGA AND SESAME SEED OIL (SESAMUM INDICUM L.) APPLICATION. IN ADDITION TO YOGA AND SESAME SEED OIL, STUDY GROUP RECEIVED HSF FOR 15 MIN PER DAY FOR 5-DAYS. ASSESSMENTS WERE TAKEN PRIOR TO AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION. RESULTS: RESULTS OF THE STUDY SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE SCORES OF VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE FOR PAIN, NECK DISABILITY INDEX (NDI), THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI), AND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PHYSICAL FUNCTION, PHYSICAL HEALTH, EMOTIONAL PROBLEM, PAIN, AND GENERAL HEALTH BOTH IN STUDY AND CONTROL GROUPS. HOWEVER, REDUCTIONS IN PAIN AND NDI ALONG WITH IMPROVEMENT IN SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WERE BETTER IN THE STUDY GROUP AS COMPARED WITH CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT ADDITION OF HSF TO YOGA PROVIDES A BETTER REDUCTION IN PAIN AND DISABILITY ALONG WITH IMPROVEMENT IN THE SOCIAL FUNCTIONING OF THE PATIENTS WITH NON-SPECIFIC NECK PAIN THAN YOGA ALONE.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
6 1852  49 RANDOMISED CLINICAL TRIAL: YOGA VS A LOW-FODMAP DIET IN PATIENTS WITH IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME. BACKGROUND: IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME IS THE MOST FREQUENT GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDER. IT IS ASSUMED THAT LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS MIGHT BE A RATIONAL TREATMENT APPROACH. AIM: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF A YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION VS A LOW-FODMAP DIET ON PATIENTS WITH IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME. METHODS: FIFTY-NINE PATIENTS WITH IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME UNDERTOOK A SINGLE-BLIND, RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL INVOLVING YOGA OR A LOW-FODMAP DIET FOR 12 WEEKS. PATIENTS IN THE YOGA GROUP RECEIVED TWO SESSIONS WEEKLY, WHILE PATIENTS IN THE LOW-FODMAP GROUP RECEIVED A TOTAL OF THREE SESSIONS OF NUTRITIONAL COUNSELLING. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS A CHANGE IN GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS (IBS-SSS). SECONDARY OUTCOMES EXPLORED CHANGES IN QUALITY OF LIFE (IBS-QOL), HEALTH (SF-36), PERCEIVED STRESS (CPSS, PSQ), BODY AWARENESS (BAQ), BODY RESPONSIVENESS (BRS) AND SAFETY OF THE INTERVENTIONS. OUTCOMES WERE EXAMINED IN WEEKS 12 AND 24 BY ASSESSORS "BLINDED" TO PATIENTS' GROUP ALLOCATION. RESULTS: NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND BETWEEN THE INTERVENTION GROUPS, WITH REGARD TO IBS-SSS SCORE, AT EITHER 12 (DELTA = 31.80; 95%CI = -11.90, 75.50; P = .151) OR 24 WEEKS (DELTA = 33.41; 95%CI = -4.21, 71.04; P = .081). WITHIN-GROUP COMPARISONS SHOWED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS FOR YOGA AND LOW-FODMAP DIET AT BOTH 12 AND 24 WEEKS (ALL P < .001). COMPARABLE WITHIN-GROUP EFFECTS OCCURRED FOR THE OTHER OUTCOMES. ONE PATIENT IN EACH INTERVENTION GROUP EXPERIENCED SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (P = 1.00) AND ANOTHER, ALSO IN EACH GROUP, EXPERIENCED NONSERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (P = 1.00). CONCLUSIONS: PATIENTS WITH IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME MIGHT BENEFIT FROM YOGA AND A LOW-FODMAP DIET, AS BOTH GROUPS SHOWED A REDUCTION IN GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS. MORE RESEARCH ON THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS OF BOTH INTERVENTIONS IS WARRANTED, AS WELL AS EXPLORATION OF POTENTIAL BENEFITS FROM THEIR COMBINED USE.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
7  866  46 EFFECT OF YOGA PROGRAM ON EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS OF ADOLESCENTS DWELLING IN AN ORPHAN HOME: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. EXECUTIVE FUNCTION (EF) IS IMPORTANT FOR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OF CHILDREN. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT CHILDREN WITH POVERTY AND EARLY LIFE STRESS HAVE REDUCED EF. THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA PROGRAM ON THE EF OF ORPHAN ADOLESCENTS. SEVENTY TWO APPARENTLY HEALTHY ORPHAN ADOLESCENTS RANDOMIZED AND ALLOCATED INTO TWO GROUPS AS YOGA GROUP (N = 40; 14 GIRLS, AGE = 12.69 +/- 1.35 YRS) AND WAIT LIST CONTROL (WLC) GROUP (N = 32, 13 GIRLS, AGE = 12.58 +/- 1.52 YRS). YOGA GROUP UNDERWENT THREE MONTHS OF YOGA PROGRAM IN A SCHEDULE OF 90 MIN PER DAY, FOUR DAYS PER WEEK WHEREAS THE WLC GROUP FOLLOWED THE ROUTINE ACTIVITIES. THEY WERE ASSESSED BY STROOP COLOR-WORD TASK, DIGIT SYMBOL SUBSTITUTION TEST (DSST), DIGITS SPAN TEST AND TRIAL MAKING TEST (TMT) AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE PROGRAM. THE REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN TIME AND GROUP INTERACTIONS (P < 0.05) FOR ALL SUBTESTS OF STROOP COLOR-WORD TASK AND DIGIT SPAN TEST AND PART-A OF TMT WHEREAS THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE FOUND IN DSST AND TMT (PART-B). THE POST-HOC TEST WITH BONFERRONI ADJUSTMENT ALSO SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS (P < 0.001) WITHIN THE YOGA GROUP IN ALL TEST SCORES WHILE IN WRONG SCORE OF DSST DID NOT EXHIBIT SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION. WHEREAS THE WLC GROUP, SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT (P < 0.05) IN STROOP COLOR, COLOR-WORD SCORE, NET SCORE OF DSST, DIGIT SPAN FORWARD AND DIGIT SPAN TOTAL. THREE MONTHS YOGA PROGRAM WAS FOUND USEFUL FOR THE YOUNG ORPHAN ADOLESCENTS IN IMPROVING THEIR EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
8  277  39 ADDITIONAL PRACTICE OF YOGA BREATHING WITH INTERMITTENT BREATH HOLDING ENHANCES PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS IN YOGA PRACTITIONERS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: THE PRACTICE OF YOGA IS ASSOCIATED WITH ENHANCED PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING. THE CURRENT STUDY ASSESSED THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE DURATION OF YOGA PRACTICE WITH STATE MINDFULNESS, MIND-WANDERING AND STATE ANXIETY. ALSO, WE EXAMINED IF AN ADDITIONAL 20 MIN OF YOGA BREATHING WITH INTERMITTENT BREATH HOLDING (EXPERIMENTAL GROUP) FOR 8 WEEKS WOULD AFFECT THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIABLES MORE THAN REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE (CONTROL GROUP) ALONE. METHODS: ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN SUBJECTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EXPERIMENTAL (N = 60) AND CONTROL (N = 56) GROUPS. STATE MINDFULNESS ATTENTION AWARENESS SCALE (SMAAS), MIND-WANDERING QUESTIONNAIRE (MWQ) AND STATE ANXIETY INVENTORY WERE ADMINISTERED AT BASELINE AND AT THE END OF 8 WEEKS. RESULTS: BASELINE ASSESSMENT REVEALED A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN DURATION OF YOGA PRACTICE WITH SMAAS SCORES AND NEGATIVE CORRELATION WITH MWQ AND STATE ANXIETY SCORES. AT THE END OF 8 WEEKS, BOTH GROUPS DEMONSTRATED ENHANCED PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS, BUT THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP RECEIVING ADDITIONAL YOGA BREATHING PERFORMED BETTER THAN THE GROUP PRACTICING YOGA ALONE. CONCLUSION: AN ADDITIONAL PRACTICE OF YOGA BREATHING WITH INTERMITTENT BREATH HOLDING WAS FOUND TO ENHANCE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS IN YOUNG ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS.	2018

RESULTS: FOLLOWING THE PROGRAM, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN MOBILITY (P = 0.482), PERCEIVED WALKING QUALITY (P = 0.325), RESPIRATORY MUSCLE STRENGTH (MAXIMUM INSPIRATORY PRESSURE: P = 0.263, MAXIMUM EXPIRATORY PRESSURE: P = 0.866), AND COGNITION (SYMBOL DIGIT MODALITIES TEST: P = 0.324, CALIFORNIA VERBAL LEARNING TEST-II: P = 0.514, BRIEF VISUOSPATIAL MEMORY TEST-REVISED: P = 0.279) BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. IMPROVEMENTS WERE HIGHER IN BALANCE CONFIDENCE (P = 0.006), WALKING SPEED (P = 0.004), AND QUALITY OF LIFE (P = 0.019) IN THE CLINICAL PILATES GROUP COMPARED TO THE YOGA GROUP. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY SHOWED POSITIVE EFFECTS IN WALKING AND RESPIRATORY ASPECTS IN PWMS WHO RECEIVED YOGA AND CLINICAL PILATES TRAINING. PILATES TRAINING WAS SUPERIOR IN IMPROVING WALKING SPEED, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND BALANCE CONFIDENCE COMPARED TO YOGA TRAINING.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
10 1081  46 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SEXUAL FUNCTION IN WOMEN WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: FEMALE SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION IS AN IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE; IT HAS A HIGH GLOBAL PREVALENCE, BUT NO EFFECTIVE AND SAFE TREATMENT OPTIONS. THE PREVALENCE OF SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION IS HIGHER IN WOMEN WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME THAN IN THE GENERAL POPULATION. AIM: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA AS A TREATMENT FOR SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION IN WOMEN WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME. METHODS: IN THIS RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED STUDY, 41 WOMEN WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME (AGE 30-60 YEARS) WERE ASSIGNED TO A 12-WEEK YOGA EXERCISE GROUP (N=20) OR A WAIT-LISTED CONTROL GROUP (N=21). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PRIMARY END POINTS WERE CHANGES IN TOTAL AND INDIVIDUAL DOMAIN SCORES ON THE FEMALE SEXUAL FUNCTION INDEX. RESULTS: THE 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN AROUSAL (0.74+/-1.18 VS. 0.16+/-0.82, RESPECTIVELY; P=0.042) AND LUBRICATION (0.72+/-1.12 VS. 0.06+/-0.87, RESPECTIVELY; P=0.008) COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN THE YOGA GROUP THAN IN THE CONTROL GROUP AT THE 12-WEEK FOLLOW UP (-3.5+/-13.7 VS. 2.0+/-14.7, RESPECTIVELY; P=0.040). CONCLUSION: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION IN WOMEN WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME AS WELL AS FOR METABOLIC RISK FACTORS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
11  270  53 ADD ON YOGA TREATMENT FOR NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA: A MULTI-CENTRIC, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. THE EFFICACY OF ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDICATIONS IN THE TREATMENT OF NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA IS MODEST AT BEST. PRELIMINARY STUDIES SUGGEST THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF ADD ON YOGA, A TRADITIONAL INDIAN PRACTICE, IN THE TREATMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. HENCE, IN THIS STUDY, WE EXAMINED THE EFFICACY OF YOGA AS AN ADD-ON TREATMENT FOR NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA IN A RANDOMIZED, WAIT-LIST CONTROLLED DESIGN FROM TWO CLINICAL INSTITUTES IN SOUTH INDIA. 89 PATIENTS (AGE - 34.20 +/- 8.06 YEARS; EDUCATION - 14.22 +/- 2.69 YEARS; 28 FEMALES) WERE RANDOMIZED INTO THE ADD-ON YOGA OR TREATMENT AS USUAL (TAU - WAIT-LIST CONTROL) GROUP. PATIENTS HAD A MEAN ILLNESS DURATION OF 10.97 +/- 7.24 YEARS WITH AN AGE AT ONSET OF 23.34 +/- 5.81 YEARS. CENTRAL BLOCK RANDOMIZATION WAS FOLLOWED TO ENSURE CONCEALED ALLOCATION. PARTICIPANTS RANDOMIZED TO THE YOGA TREATMENT GROUP ATTENDED 12 SUPERVISED YOGA TRAINING SESSIONS OVER TWO WEEKS AND PRACTICED YOGA SESSIONS AT HOME FOR THE SUBSEQUENT 10 WEEKS. 64 PATIENTS COMPLETED THE TRIAL. AN INTENT TO TREAT ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED WITH 89 PARTICIPANTS USING A LINEAR MIXED MODEL. IMPROVEMENT IN NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS WAS OUR PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE. THE TWO GROUPS WERE MATCHED ON DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES AND BASELINE PSYCHOPATHOLOGY SEVERITY. PARTICIPANTS IN THE ADD-ON YOGA GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS (SANS BASELINE: 49.13 +/- 2.30; 12-WEEKS FOLLOW UP: 31.55 +/- 2.53) COMPARED TO THE TAU GROUP (SANS BASELINE: 51.22 +/- 2.40; 12-WEEKS FOLLOW UP: 45.30 +/- 2.93; T = 3.36; P = 0.006; COHEN'S D-0.65). THE CURRENT STUDY FINDINGS SUGGEST THE EFFICACY OF YOGA AS AN ADD-ON TREATMENT FOR NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA PRACTICE AS A REGULAR CLINICAL INTERVENTION FOR PATIENTS NEEDS TO BE EXPLORED IN FUTURE STUDIES BY INTEGRATING YOGA SERVICES ALONG WITH OTHER CLINICAL SERVICES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
12  819  40 EFFECT OF YOGA ON DEPRESSION IN HYPOTHYROIDISM: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: THE PREVALENCE OF HYPOTHYROIDISM AMONG INDIAN WOMEN IS 15.8%. DEPRESSION IS FREQUENTLY REPORTED IN HYPOTHYROIDISM. YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR DEPRESSION. HOWEVER, THE INFLUENCE OF YOGA ON DEPRESSION IN PATIENTS WITH HYPOTHYROIDISM HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED. AIM: THE PRESENT STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECT OF A 3-MONTH INTEGRATED YOGA INTERVENTION (3-IY) ON DEPRESSION, LIPID INDICES, AND SERUM THYROID-STIMULATING HORMONE (STSH) LEVELS AMONG FEMALE PATIENTS HAVING HYPOTHYROIDISM, AND MILD-TO-MODERATE DEPRESSION. METHOD: THE PRESENT SINGLE-ARM PRE-POST DESIGN STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN THIRTY-EIGHT WOMEN (AVERAGE AGE 34.2 +/- 4.7 YEARS). PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED A 3-IY COMPRISING ASANAS, PRANAYAMA, AND RELAXATION TECHNIQUES FOR 60 MIN DAILY (5 DAYS A WEEK). DEPRESSION, STSH, LIPID PROFILE INDICES, BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), FATIGUE, ANXIETY, AND STRESS WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND AFTER 12 WEEKS. THYROID MEDICATION WAS KEPT CONSTANT DURING THE STUDY PERIOD. DATA WERE ANALYSED USING R STUDIO SOFTWARE. RESULT: A SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.05) REDUCTION IN DEPRESSION (58%), STSH (37%), BMI (6%), FATIGUE (64%), ANXIETY (57%), LIPID PROFILE INDICES (HLD INCREASED SIGNIFICANTY), AND STRESS (55%) LEVELS WAS OBSERVED AFTER 3 MONTHS, COMPARED WITH THE CORRESPONDING BASELINE LEVELS. CONCLUSION: THE 3-IY IS USEFUL FOR REDUCING DEPRESSION, DYSLIPIDEMIA, AND STSH IN WOMEN WITH HYPOTHYROIDISM AND DEPRESSION.

13  459  44 CHANGES IN PAIN INTENSITY AND HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE WITH IYENGAR YOGA IN NONSPECIFIC CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. BACKGROUND: NONSPECIFIC CHRONIC LOW BACK (NCLBP) PAIN IS PREVALENT AMONG ADULT POPULATION AND OFTEN LEADS TO FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS, PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS, LOWER QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), AND HIGHER HEALTHCARE COSTS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF IYENGAR YOGA THERAPY ON PAIN INTENSITY AND HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) WITH NCLBP. AIM OF THE STUDY: TO COMPARE THE EFFECT OF IYENGAR YOGA THERAPY AND CONVENTIONAL EXERCISE THERAPY ON PAIN INTENSITY AND HRQOL IN NONSPECIFIC CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WITH RANDOM SAMPLING TECHNIQUE. SUBJECTS/INTERVENTION: SIXTY SUBJECTS WHO FULFILLED THE SELECTION CRITERIA WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO IYENGAR YOGA (YOGA GROUP, N = 30) AND CONTROL GROUP (EXERCISE GROUP, N = 30). PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED LOW BACK PAIN EVALUATION FORM AND HRQOL-4 QUESTIONNAIRE BEFORE THEIR INTERVENTION AND AGAIN 4 WEEKS AND 6 MONTH LATER. YOGA GROUP UNDERWENT 29 YOGIC POSTURES TRAINING AND EXERCISE GROUP HAD UNDERGONE GENERAL EXERCISE PROGRAM FOR 4 WEEKS. STATISTICS: REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA) WAS USED TO ANALYZE GROUP DIFFERENCES OVER TIME, WHILE CONTROLLING FOR BASELINE DIFFERENCES. RESULTS: PATIENTS IN BOTH GROUPS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PAIN AND IMPROVEMENT IN HRQOL. IN VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS) YOGA GROUP SHOWED REDUCTION OF 72.81% (P = 0.001) AS COMPARED TO EXERCISE GROUP 42.50% (P = 0.001). IN HRQOL, YOGA GROUP SHOWED REDUCTION OF 86.99% (P = 0.001) AS COMPARED TO EXERCISE GROUP 67.66% (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT IYENGAR YOGA PROVIDES BETTER IMPROVEMENT IN PAIN REDUCTION AND IMPROVEMENT IN HRQOL IN NONSPECIFIC CHRONIC BACK PAIN THAN GENERAL EXERCISE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
14  771  46 EFFECT OF YOGA AND AEROBICS EXERCISE ON SLEEP QUALITY IN WOMEN WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS INVESTIGATING THE EFFECT OF 12 WEEKS OF YOGA AND AEROBIC EXERCISE (RUNNING ON A TREADMILL) ON THE SLEEP QUALITY IN WOMEN WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 39 DIABETIC WOMEN WERE SELECTED FROM SEMNAN CITY WITH THE MEAN AGE OF 46.85+/-3.35 YEARS, WEIGHT OF 69.79+/-17.18 KG, HEIGHT OF 155.03+/-5.00, BMI OF 29.64+/-5.00 KG/M(2) WHO HAD A BACKGROUND OF DIABETES FOR 6.46+/-2.69 YEARS. THEY WERE THEN RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO YOGA EXERCISE (N=15), AEROBIC EXERCISE (N=13), AND CONTROL GROUP (N=11). THE EXERCISE PROGRAM WAS PERFORMED FOR 12 WEEKS, THREE SESSIONS PER EACH WEEK. IN ORDER TO MEASURE THE SLEEP QUALITY, THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI) WAS USED. THE DATA WERE ANALYZED BY NON-PARAMETRIC WILCOXON AND KRUSKAL-WALLIS TEST AT SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL OF P<0.05. RESULTS: OVERALL SCORE OF SLEEP QUALITY IMPROVED AFTER SIX (P=0.001) AND 12 (P=0.001) WEEKS OF YOGA EXERCISE. ALSO, SIGNIFICANT EFFECT WAS OBSERVED AFTER 6 WEEKS OF AEROBIC EXERCISE (P=0.039). HOWEVER, THE POSITIVE EFFECT WAS DIMINISHED TO UNDER SIGNIFICANT LEVELS AFTER 12 WEEKS OF AEROBIC EXERCISE (P=0.154). KRUSKAL-WALLIS TEST SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN YOGA AND AEROBIC GROUPS AFTER 12 WEEKS OF EXERCISE (P=0.002). NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED IN CONTROL GROUPS IN ALL SITUATION. CONCLUSIONS: IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT YOGA EXERCISE IS MORE EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING THE SLEEP QUALITY IN COMPARISON WITH THE SAME COURSE OF AEROBIC EXERCISE IN WOMEN SUFFERING FROM DIABETES TYPE 2. THUS, YOGA EXERCISE CAN BE SUGGESTED TO THESE PATIENTS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
15 2461  30 YOGA AS A NOVEL ADJUVANT THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH IDIOPATHIC INFLAMMATORY MYOPATHIES. CONTEXT: RECENT STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS WELL TOLERATED BY PATIENTS WITH IDIOPATHIC INFLAMMATORY MYOPATHIES (IIMS) AND CAN HAVE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS AS AN ADJUVANT THERAPY TO PHARMACOLOGIC AGENTS, ESPECIALLY IF STARTED EARLY. TO DATE, NO STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PATIENTS WITH IIMS. AIMS: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SELF-REPORTED DIFFICULTY IN PERFORMING ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING (ADL) AND MUSCLE STRENGTH IN PATIENTS WITH MILD-TO-MODERATE IIMS. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A LONGITUDINAL COHORT STUDY IN WHICH PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSESSED USING THE MYOSITIS ACTIVITIES PROFILE (MAP) AND MANUAL MUSCLE TESTING (MMT) BEFORE AND AFTER THE COMPLETION OF AN 8-WEEK INSTRUCTOR-GUIDED YOGA COURSE WAS PERFORMED. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: WILCOXON SIGNED-RANKED TEST WAS PERFORMED FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. RESULTS: THE AVERAGE POSTTREATMENT MAP SCORES OF SIX PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED AN INCREASE OF 2.51 POINTS, WHILE THE AVERAGE MMT SCORE OF FOUR PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED AN INCREASE OF 11 POINTS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY IS THE FIRST STUDY TO DATE TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA AS AN ADJUVANT COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH IIM. CONTINUED RESEARCH SHOULD BE DONE ON THE EFFECT OF YOGA AS AN ADJUVANT THERAPY, FOR IN ADDITION TO INCREASE IN MUSCLE STRENGTH AND ABILITY TO PERFORM ADL, YOGA MAY OFFER POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS IN MOOD, MENTAL HEALTH, AND SLEEP.	2021

THOSE WITH CARDIAC DISEASE, JAUNDICE, TUBERCULOSIS, OR ON ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY/YOGA INTERVENTION WERE EXCLUDED. ALL WERE GIVEN STANDARD CARE, RANDOMIZED TO SKY INTERVENTION (31: I-SKY) AND ONLY STANDARD OF CARE IN CONTROL (30: O-SOC) ARMS. THE I-SKY PARTICIPANTS WERE TRAINED FOR SIX DAYS TO PREPARE FOR DAILY PRACTICE OF SKY AT HOME FOR 30 MIN. A VALIDATED 31-ITEM WHOQOL-HIVBREF QUESTIONNAIRE WAS USED TO DOCUMENT EFFECT IN BOTH ARMS FROM BASELINE TO THREE VISITS AT 4 WK INTERVAL. RESULTS: BASELINE QOL SCORES, HYPERTENSION AND CD4 COUNT WERE SIMILAR IN BOTH ARMS. AN OVERALL 6 PER CENT IMPROVEMENT OF QOL SCORES WAS OBSERVED IN I-SKY GROUP AS COMPARED TO O-SOC GROUP, AFTER CONTROLLING FOR BASELINE VARIABLES LIKE AGE, GENDER, EDUCATION AND OCCUPATION ( P =0.016); 12 PER CENT FOR PHYSICAL ( P =0.004), 11 PER CENT PSYCHOLOGICAL (P =0.023) AND 9 PER CENT LEVEL OF INDEPENDENCE (P =0.001) DOMAINS. IMPROVEMENT IN I-SKY OBSERVED AT POST-TRAINING AND IN THE SKY ADHERENCE GROUP SHOWED INCREASE IN THESE TWO DOMAINS. CONCLUSIONS: A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN QOL SCORES WAS OBSERVED FOR THE THREE HEALTH RELATED QOL DOMAINS IN SKY INTERVENTION ARM. THIS LOW COST STRATEGY IMPROVED PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE OF PLHIV CALLING FOR UPSCALING WITH EFFECTIVE MONITORING FOR SUSTAINABILITY OF QUALITY OF LIFE.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
17 1818  41 PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF STANDARD ANTIEMETIC THERAPY WITH YOGA VERSUS STANDARD ANTIEMETIC THERAPY ALONE FOR HIGHLY EMETOGENIC CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA AND VOMITING IN SOUTH ASIAN POPULATION. AIM/BACKGROUND: CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA AND VOMITING (CINV) IS ONE OF THE MOST DISTRESSING SIDE EFFECTS OF HIGHLY EMETOGENIC CHEMOTHERAPY REGIMENS. THERE HAVE BEEN CONTINUOUS EFFORTS IN THE DIRECTION TO CONTROL CINV BY MANY INVESTIGATORS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RANDOMLY SELECTED PATIENTS WERE THOSE RECEIVING HIGHLY EMETOGENIC CHEMOTHERAPY REGIMEN GROUPED INTO YOGA AND STANDARD ANTIEMETIC THERAPY (N = 50) JUST BEFORE RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY AND CONTINUED FOR THE FOLLOWING DAYS AND OTHER GROUP (N = 50) RECEIVED ONLY THE STANDARD ANTIEMETIC AGENT. BOTH THE GROUPS WERE ASSESSED, FOLLOWED FOR ACUTE AND DELAYED ONSET OF CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED AND ANTICIPATORY NAUSEA AND VOMITING USING RADIATION THERAPY ONCOLOGY GROUP GRADING FOR THE SAME. WE ALSO ASSESSED THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF THE PATIENT USING THE FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CANCER THERAPY-GENERAL QUESTIONNAIRE. RESULTS: THE MEDIAN AGE GROUP OF THE PATIENTS WAS 51 YEARS WITH MALE:FEMALE RATIO 2:1, THE EASTERN COOPERATIVE ONCOLOGY GROUP (ECOG) PERFORMANCE STATUS WAS 0/1 IN 38% OF THE SELECTED POPULATION, WHILE ECOG 2 IN 62% OF THE PATIENTS. IN YOGA ARM, INSIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA (90% VS. 78%, P = 0.35) AND BUT SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN VOMITING (42% VS. 22%, P =0.01) WAS OBSERVED AS COMPARED TO THE STANDARD ANTIEMETICS ONLY ARM. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN GRADE 2 AND 3 NAUSEA (84% VS. 38% P < 0.01) AND VOMITING (14% VS. 0% P < 0.01). QUALITY OF LIFE IS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED IN THE YOGA ARM, ESPECIALLY IN THE ECOG 2 PERFORMANCE STATUS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY CONCLUDES THAT YOGA ALONG WITH STANDARD ANTIEMETIC MEDICATION SHOULD BE A PART OF THE MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR THE CANCER PATIENTS RECEIVING HIGHLY EMETOGENIC CHEMOTHERAPY.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
18 2799  43 YOGA THERAPY FOR SOCIAL COGNITION IN SCHIZOPHRENIA: AN EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE-BASED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS AND COGNITIVE DEFICITS ARE DIFFICULT-TO-TREAT SYMPTOMS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. IN THIS SINGLE BLIND RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY, WE COMPARED CHANGE IN SOCIAL COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE IN PERSONS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA (PWS) (AS PER DSM-5), AFTER 6 WEEKS OF YOGA INTERVENTION WITH A WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP. WE ALSO EXAMINED CHANGES IN PUTATIVE MIRROR NEURON SYSTEM (MNS) ACTIVITY MEASURED BY TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION (TMS) IN A SUBSET OF SAMPLE (N = 30). 51 PWS STABILIZED ON ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDICATION FOR AT LEAST 6 WEEKS, WERE ASSIGNED TO ADD-ON YOGA THERAPY (YT) (N = 26) OR WAITLIST (WL) (N = 25). SUBJECTS IN THE YT GROUP RECEIVED ADD-ON YOGA THERAPY (20 SESSIONS IN 6 WEEKS). BOTH THE GROUPS CONTINUED THEIR STANDARD TREATMENT AND WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND AFTER 6 WEEKS FOR SOCIAL COGNITION, CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND SOCIAL DISABILITY. RM-ANOVA SHOWED SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION BETWEEN TIME AND GROUP FOR SOCIAL COGNITION COMPOSITE SCORE (SCCS) (F = 42.09 [1,44], P < 0.001); NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS (SANS) (F = 74.91 [1,45], P < 0.001); POSITIVE SYMPTOMS (SAPS) (F = 16.05 [1,45], P < 0.001) AND SOCIAL DISABILITY (GSDS) (F = 29.91 [1,46], P < 0.001). MNS ACTIVITY HAD INCREASED AFTER 6 WEEKS IN BOTH GROUPS BUT NOT OF STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT 6 WEEKS OF ADD-ON YOGA THERAPY COULD IMPROVE SOCIAL COGNITION IN PWS COMPARED TO WAITLIST CONTROL SUBJECTS. HOWEVER, THE CHANGE IN SOCIAL COGNITION WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH A CHANGE IN THE PUTATIVE MNS-ACTIVITY. IT NECESSIATATES FURTHER STUDIES TO INVESTIGATE THE MECHANISTIC PROCESSES OF YOGA AND REPLICATE THESE OBSERVATIONS IN A LARGER SAMPLE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
19 2187  66 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH: A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: UNIVERSITIES AROUND THE WORLD ARE FACING AN EPIDEMIC OF MENTAL DISTRESS AMONG THEIR STUDENTS. THE PROBLEM IS TRULY A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE, AFFECTING MANY AND WITH SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES. THE GLOBAL BURDEN OF DISEASE-AGENDA CALLS FOR EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS WITH LASTING EFFECTS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE MENTAL HEALTH OF YOUNG ADULTS. IN THIS STUDY WE AIMED TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOGA, A POPULAR AND WIDELY AVAILABLE MIND-BODY PRACTICE, CAN IMPROVE STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH. METHODS: WE PERFORMED A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH 202 HEALTHY UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN THE OSLO AREA. THE PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSIGNED TO A YOGA GROUP OR WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP IN A 1:1 RATIO BY A SIMPLE ONLINE RANDOMISATION PROGRAM. THE INTERVENTION GROUP WAS OFFERED 24 YOGA SESSIONS OVER 12 WEEKS. MEASUREMENTS WERE TAKEN AT WEEK 0 (BASELINE), WEEK 12 (POST-INTERVENTION), AND WEEK 24 (FOLLOW-UP). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS ASSESSED BY THE HSCL-25 QUESTIONNAIRE. ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED BASED ON THE INTENTION TO TREAT-PRINCIPLE. RESULTS: BETWEEN 24 JANUARY 2017, AND 27 AUGUST 2017, WE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED 202 STUDENTS TO A YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 100), OR WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 102). COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP, THE YOGA PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DISTRESS SYMPTOMS BOTH AT POST-INTERVENTION (ADJUSTED DIFFERENCE IN THE MEAN CHANGE -0.15, 95% CI -0.26 TO -0.03, P = 0.0110) AND FOLLOW-UP (ADJUSTED DIFFERENCE IN THE MEAN CHANGE -0.18, 95% CI -0.29 TO -0.06, P = 0.0025). SLEEP QUALITY ALSO IMPROVED AT POST-INTERVENTION AND FOLLOW-UP. NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS: OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA HAS A MODERATELY LARGE AND LASTING EFFECT, AT LEAST FOR SOME MONTHS, REDUCING SYMPTOMS OF DISTRESS AND IMPROVING SLEEP QUALITY AMONG STUDENTS. FURTHER RESEARCH SHOULD SEEK WAYS TO ENHANCE THE EFFECT, ASSESS AN EVEN LONGER FOLLOW-UP PERIOD, INCLUDE ACTIVE CONTROL GROUPS, AND CONSIDER PERFORMING SIMILAR STUDIES IN OTHER CULTURAL SETTINGS.TRIAL REGISTRATION: CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT04258540.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
20   97  28 A NONRANDOMIZED COMPARISON STUDY OF SELF-HYPNOSIS, YOGA, AND COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY TO REDUCE EMOTIONAL DISTRESS IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. THE AUTHORS ASKED BREAST CANCER (BC) PATIENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN 1 OF 3 MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS (COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT), YOGA, OR SELF-HYPNOSIS) TO EXPLORE THEIR FEASIBILITY, EASE OF COMPLIANCE, AND IMPACT ON THE PARTICIPANTS' DISTRESS, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), SLEEP, AND MENTAL ADJUSTMENT. NINETY-NINE PATIENTS COMPLETED AN INTERVENTION (CBT: N = 10; YOGA: N = 21; AND SELF-HYPNOSIS: N = 68). RESULTS SHOWED HIGH FEASIBILITY AND HIGH COMPLIANCE. AFTER THE INTERVENTIONS, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT IN THE CBT GROUP BUT SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECTS ON DISTRESS IN THE YOGA AND SELF-HYPNOSIS GROUPS, AND, ALSO, ON QOL, SLEEP, AND MENTAL ADJUSTMENT IN THE SELF-HYPNOSIS GROUP. IN CONCLUSION, MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS CAN DECREASE DISTRESS IN BC PATIENTS, BUT RCTS ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE FINDINGS.	2017

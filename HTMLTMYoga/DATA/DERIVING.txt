1 1032 155 EFFECTS OF YOGA EXERCISES ON DIABETIC MELLITUS AS VALIDATED BY MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING. CONTEXT AND AIMS: EFFECTS OF PRACTICING YOGA IN DIABETIC MELLITUS (DM) PATIENTS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED TO IMPROVE IN CONTROL OF BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS WORK IS TO EVALUATE CHANGES IN BLOOD FLOW OF CALF MUSCLES AFTER SPECIFIC YOGA POSTURES FOR PATIENTS WITH DM USING MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) TECHNIQUES. TIME OF FLIGHT (TOF) MAGNETIC RESONANCE ANGIOGRAPHY MAXIMUM INTENSITY PROJECTION (MIP), T1 MAPS, T2 MAPS, AND DIFFUSION-WEIGHTED IMAGING ARE PERFORMED ON VOLUNTEERS AND DM PATIENTS BOTH PRE- AND POST-EXERCISE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TOF MIP, T1 MAPS WITH VARIABLE FLIP ANGLES, AND T2-WEIGHTED SPIN-ECHO IMAGING WERE PERFORMED ON FOUR VOLUNTEERS (AGED 30 +/- 5) AND DM PATIENTS (AGED 32-68) PREEXERCISE, ON A 1.5 T SIEMENS SCANNER. THE TOTAL ACQUISITION TIME WAS 6 MIN 20 S. EACH VOLUNTEER AND DM PATIENT WERE THEN REQUESTED TO PERFORM YOGA POSTURES SUPTA PADANGUSTHASANA, UTKATASANA, AND CALF RAISE FOR 6 MIN 30 S AT MAXIMUM EFFORT, OUTSIDE THE SCANNER, AND SUBSEQUENTLY RESCANNED. TO CALCULATE SIGNIFICANT SIGNAL INCREASE, REGION OF INTERESTS WAS DRAWN ON TOF MIP CORONAL IMAGES IN ARTERIES OF CALF MUSCLES. STUDENT T-TESTS WERE PERFORMED TO DETERMINE STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. RESULTS: AMONG VOLUNTEERS, A SIGNIFICANT SIGNAL INCREASE IN ARTERIES OF CALF MUSCLES WAS NOTICED, SIGNAL INTENSITY GRAPHS WERE PLOTTED. IN DM PATIENTS, SIGNAL INCREASE IN TOF MIP, T2-WEIGHTED IMAGES WERE SEEN IN SPECIFIC ARTERIES (POSTERIOR, ANTERIOR TIBIAL, AND POSTERIOR TIBIAL) OF CALF MUSCLES POSTEXERCISE. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: THE STUDY INDICATES THAT YOGA HAS A POSITIVE SHORT-TERM EFFECT ON MULTIPLE DM-RELATED FOOT COMPLICATIONS. THIS STUDY DEPICTS THAT MRI PROVIDES POTENTIAL INSIGHT INTO THE BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR DM PATIENTS THROUGH DERIVING BIOMARKERS FOR PREVENTIVE MEDICINE RELEVANT TO YOGA INTERCEPTION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
2  605  27 DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF YOGA MODULE FOR ANGER MANAGEMENT IN ADOLESCENTS. BACKGROUND: DEVELOPMENT OF ANGER MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS AND IN PARTICULAR, YOGA MODULE FOR ANGER MANAGEMENT HAS NOT BEEN WELL RESEARCHED. BEING A COMPLEX EMOTION, ANGER POSES SERIOUS CHALLENGES IN DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE ANGER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. WHILE VARIOUS THEORIES OF ANGER ARE DEALT IN MODERN PSYCHOLOGY, SEVERAL ANGER MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES ARE SET FORTH IN INDIAN TRADITIONAL TEXTS. YOGA, WHICH IS CONSIDERED AS A HOLISTIC AND INTEGRATED APPROACH IS EXPLORED IN THIS STUDY TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE A SCHOOL-BASED YOGA PROGRAM FOR ANGER MANAGEMENT IN ADOLESCENCE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: INTEGRATED APPROACH TO YOGA THERAPY (IAYT) PRINCIPLES AND LITERARY REVIEW FORMED THE BASIS FOR DERIVING THE CONCEPTS OF ANGER MANAGEMENT. THE METHODOLOGY INCLUDES CONSTRUCTION OF THE YOGA MODULE, VALIDATION OF THE MODULE BY 22 EXPERTS FOLLOWED BY A PILOT NON-RANDOMISED CONTROL STUDY (N-50) TO ASSESS FEASIBILITY AND INITIAL EFFECTIVENESS. CONTENT VALIDITY RATIO (CVR) AND PAIRED T-TEST WERE EMPLOYED TO ANALYSE THE EXPERTS' RATING AND PILOT-STUDY DATA RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS: EMERGENCE OF IAYT BASED YOGA PROGRAM FOR ANGER MANAGEMENT. BASED ON CVR RATIO, 16 OUT OF 18 YOGIC TECHNIQUES QUALIFIED FOR THE FINAL MODULE. THE PILOT STUDY REVEALED VIABILITY OF THE MODULE AND ITS RECOGNITION AS AN ANGER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF ANGER SCORES IN YOGA GROUP SUBSTANTIATES INITIAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MODULE. CONCLUSION: THE DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED YOGA MODULE FOR ANGER MANAGEMENT IS RECOGNISED AS A WELL-ACCEPTED AND EFFECTIVE YOGA PROGRAM FOR ANGER MANAGEMENT IN ADOLESCENTS.	2021

4  602  31 DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF A YOGA MODULE FOR PARKINSON DISEASE. BACKGROUND PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD), A PROGRESSIVE NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE, AFFECTS MOTOR AND NONMOTOR FUNCTIONS, LEADING TO SEVERE DEBILITY AND POOR QUALITY OF LIFE. STUDIES HAVE REPORTED THE BENEFICIAL ROLE OF YOGA IN ALLEVIATING THE SYMPTOMS OF PD; HOWEVER, A VALIDATED YOGA MODULE FOR PD IS UNAVAILABLE. THIS STUDY DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED AN INTEGRATED YOGA MODULE(IYM) FOR PD. METHODS THE IYM WAS PREPARED AFTER A THOROUGH REVIEW OF CLASSICAL YOGA TEXTS AND PREVIOUS FINDINGS. TWENTY EXPERIENCED YOGA EXPERTS, WHO FULFILLED THE INCLUSION CRITERIA, WERE SELECTED VALIDATING THE CONTENT OF THE IYM. A TOTAL OF 28 PRACTICES WERE INCLUDED IN THE IYM, AND EACH PRACTICE WAS DISCUSSED AND RATED AS (I) NOT ESSENTIAL, (II) USEFUL BUT NOT ESSENTIAL, AND (III) ESSENTIAL; THE CONTENT VALIDITY RATIO (CVR) WAS CALCULATED USING LAWSHE'S FORMULA.

5  582  30 DESIGNING AND VALIDATION OF A YOGA-BASED MODULE FOR OBESITY WITH METABOLIC COMORBIDITIES. OBJECTIVES: OBESITY IS A CONDITION OF INCREASED ADIPOSE TISSUE IN THE BODY, WHICH IS COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS COMORBIDITIES LIKE DIABETES, HYPERTENSION, ARTHRITIS, BACK PAIN, AND MANY OTHERS. YOGA MODULES HAVE BEEN DESIGNED AND VALIDATED FOR OBESITY; HOWEVER, WE COULDN'T FIND ANY SPECIFIC MODULE FOR METABOLIC SYNDROME, A CONDITION WHICH INCLUDES OBESITY, DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2 AND/OR HYPERTENSION TOGETHER. KEEPING THIS IN VIEW, OUR STUDY AIMED TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE A SPECIFIC GENERIC YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION MODULE FOR METABOLIC SYNDROME PATIENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A YOGA MODULE WAS DESIGNED BASED ON TRADITIONAL AND CONTEMPORARY YOGA LITERATURE AS WELL AS PUBLISHED STUDIES. WE DERIVED THE YOGA PRACTICES FOR THE MODULE, FROM THESE YOGA TEXTS AND RESEARCH EVIDENCE WERE ALREADY AVAILABLE. THE YOGA MODULE WAS SENT TO 40 YOGA EXPERTS FOR THEIR VALIDATION. RESULTS: TWENTY-TWO EXPERTS GAVE THEIR OPINION ON THE USEFULNESS OF A YOGA MODULE FOR PATIENTS WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME WITH SOME SUGGESTIONS. OF THESE EXPERTS, 73% WERE MALES, AND 27% WERE FEMALES. YOGA THERAPY PRACTICES WITH CONTENT VALIDITY RATIO (CVR) >0.08 WERE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL MODULE. IN TOTAL, 86% (31 OF 36 ITEMS) OF THE ITEMS IN THE INITIAL MODULE WERE RETAINED. CONCLUSION: A SPECIFIC YOGA-BASED MODULE FOR METABOLIC SYNDROME WAS DESIGNED AND VALIDATED BY EXPERTS. FURTHER STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM THE EFFICACY AND CLINICAL UTILITY OF THE MODULE.ADDITIONAL CLINICAL VALIDATION IS SUGGESTED.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
6  601  45 DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF A NEED-BASED INTEGRATED YOGA PROGRAM FOR CANCER PATIENTS: A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY. CONTEXT AND AIM: COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES (CAM) ARE GAINING POPULARITY AMONGST PATIENTS AS ADD ON TO CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE. YOGA STANDS THIRD AMONGST ALL CAM THAT IS BEING USED BY CANCER PATIENTS TODAY. DIFFERENT SCHOOLS OF YOGA USE DIFFERENT SETS OF PRACTICES, WITH SOME USING A MORE PHYSICAL APPROACH AND MANY USING MEDITATION AND/OR BREATHING. ALL THESE MODULES ARE DEVELOPED BASED ON THE NEEDS OF THE PATIENT. THIS PAPER IS AN ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR A COMPREHENSIVE NEED BASED INTEGRATIVE YOGA MODULE FOR CANCER PATIENTS AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF TREATMENT AND FOLLOW UP. IN THIS PAPER, THE HOLISTIC MODULES OF THE INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY FOR CANCER (IAYTC) HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BASED ON THE PATIENT NEEDS, AS PER THE OBSERVATIONS BY THE CLINICIANS AND THE CAREGIVERS. AUTHORS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO SYSTEMATICALLY CREATE HOLISTIC MODULES OF IAYTC FOR VARIOUS STAGES OF THE DISEASE AND TREATMENT. THESE MODULES HAVE BEEN USED IN RANDOMIZED TRIALS TO EVALUATE ITS EFFICACY AND HAVE SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE AS ADD-ON TO CONVENTIONAL MANAGEMENT OF CANCER. THUS, THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS EFFORT WAS TO PRESENT THE THEORETICAL BASIS AND VALIDATE THE NEED BASED HOLISTIC YOGA MODULES FOR CANCER PATIENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: LITERATURE FROM TRADITIONAL TEXTS INCLUDING VEDAS, AYURVEDA, UPANISHADS, BHAGAVAT GITA, YOGA VASISHTHA ETC. AND THEIR COMMENTARIES WERE LOOKED INTO FOR REFERENCES OF CANCER AND THERAPEUTIC DIRECTIVES. PRESENT DAY SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE WAS ALSO EXPLORED WITH REGARDS TO DEFINING CANCER, ITS ETIOPATHOLOGY AND ITS MANAGEMENT. RESULTS OF STUDIES DONE USING CAM THERAPIES WERE ALSO LOOKED AT, FOR SALIENT FINDINGS. FOCUSED GROUP DISCUSSIONS (FGD) AMONGST RESEARCHERS, EXPERIENCED GURUS, AND MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS INVOLVED IN RESEARCH AND CLINICAL CANCER PRACTICE WERE CARRIED OUT WITH THE OBJECTIVES OF DETERMINING NEEDS OF THE PATIENT AND YOGA PRACTICES THAT COULD PROVE EFFICIENT. A LIST OF NEEDS AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF CONVENTIONAL THERAPIES (SURGERY, CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIATION THERAPY) WAS LISTED AND YOGA MODULES WERE DEVELOPED ACCORDINGLY. CONSIDERING THE NEEDS, EXPECTED SIDE EFFECTS, THE ENERGY LEVELS AND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL STATES OF THE PARTICIPANTS, EIGHT MODULES EVOLVED. RESULTS: THE RESULTS OF THE SIX STEPS FOR DEVELOPING THE VALIDATED MODULE ARE REPORTED. STEP 1: LITERATURE REVIEW FROM TRADITIONAL YOGA AND AYURVEDA TEXTS ON ETIOPATHOGENESIS AND MANAGEMENT OF CANCER (ARBUDA), AND THE RECENT LITERATURE ON CANCER STEM CELLS AND IMMUNOLOGY OF CANCER. STEP 2: FOCUSED GROUP DISCUSSIONS AND DELIBERATIONS TO COMPILE THE NEEDS OF PATIENTS BASED ON THE EXPECTED SIDE EFFECTS, ENERGY LEVELS AND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE OF THE PATIENT AS OBSERVED BY THE CAREGIVERS AND THE CLINICIANS. STEP 3: CONTENT VALIDATION THROUGH CONSENSUS BY THE EXPERTS FOR THE EIGHT MODULES OF IAYTC THAT COULD BE USED AS COMPLIMENTARY TO CONVENTIONAL MANAGEMENT OF CANCER AT DIFFERENT STAGES DURING AND AFTER THE DIAGNOSIS WAS CREATED. STEP 4: FIELD TESTING FOR SAFETY AND FEASIBILITY OF THE MODULES THROUGH PILOT STUDIES. STEP 5: COMPILATION OF THE RESULTS OF EFFICACY TRIALS THROUGH RCTS AND STEP 6: A REVIEW OF OUR STUDIES ON MECHANISMS TO OFFER EVIDENCE FOR ACTION OF IAYTC ON PSYCHO-NEURO-IMMUNOLOGICAL PATHWAYS IN CANCER. CONCLUSION: THE EVIDENCE FROM THE TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND RECENT SCIENTIFIC STUDIES VALIDATES EIGHT MODULES OF INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY FOR CANCER THAT CAN BE USED SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY AS COMPLIMENTARY DURING ALL CONVENTIONAL CANCER THERAPIES.	2012	

7  544  35 CONTENT VALIDITY OF AN INTEGRATED YOGA MODULE FOR PRACTICE DURING REMISSION IN RELAPSING-REMITTING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PATIENTS. BACKGROUND: SOME INVESTIGATIONS POINT TO THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA IN ALLEVIATING THE MOTOR AND COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTIONS IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) PATIENTS BY USING VARYING COMBINATIONS OF PHYSICAL, BREATHING, AND MEDITATIVE PRACTICES OF YOGA. THERE IS A NEED FOR A VALIDATED YOGA MODULE WITH A HOLISTIC APPROACH THAT CAN BE USED AS A STANDARDIZED PROTOCOL BY RESEARCHERS AND THERAPISTS. PURPOSE: TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE AN INTEGRATED YOGA MODULE FOR PRACTICE IN RELAPSING-REMITTING MS PATIENTS TO IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE. METHODS: WE DID A THOROUGH REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE YOGA MODULE. WE FORMED AN EXPERT GROUP WITH 24 EXPERTS AND A NEUROLOGIST AND USED TWO ROUNDS OF INTERACTIVE DELPHI METHOD TO COMBINE THEIR OPINION TO OBTAIN CONTENT VALIDITY OF THE MODULE THROUGH ONLINE STRUCTURED QUESTIONNAIRE PREPARED FOR THE PURPOSE ON A GOOGLE FORM. WE INCORPORATED ALL SUGGESTIONS OBTAINED BY THE EXPERTS. THE FINAL MODULE (60 MIN PER SESSION, TWICE A DAY, FIVE DAYS PER WEEK) INCLUDED WARM-UP EXERCISES, CUSTOMIZED ASANAS, RELAXATION TECHNIQUES, AND OM MEDITATION. ADVICE ON YOGIC DIET AND DISCUSSION USING YOGIC CONCEPTS FOR STRESS MANAGEMENT ALSO FORM A PART OF THE HOLISTIC APPROACH TO YOGA LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION.

8  581  31 DESIGNING AND VALIDATION OF A YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA. CONTEXT: SCHIZOPHRENIA IS A CHRONIC MENTAL ILLNESS WHICH CAUSES SIGNIFICANT DISTRESS AND DYSFUNCTION. YOGA HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE AS AN ADD-ON THERAPY IN SCHIZOPHRENIA. MODULES OF YOGA USED IN PREVIOUS STUDIES WERE BASED ON INDIVIDUAL RESEARCHER'S EXPERIENCE. AIM: THIS STUDY AIMED TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE A SPECIFIC GENERIC YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION MODULE FOR PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT NIMHANS INTEGRATED CENTRE FOR YOGA (NICY). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A YOGA MODULE WAS DESIGNED BASED ON TRADITIONAL AND CONTEMPORARY YOGA LITERATURE AS WELL AS PUBLISHED STUDIES. THE YOGA MODULE ALONG WITH THREE CASE VIGNETTES OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA WAS SENT TO 10 YOGA EXPERTS FOR THEIR VALIDATION. RESULTS: EXPERTS (N = 10) GAVE THEIR OPINION ON THE USEFULNESS OF A YOGA MODULE FOR PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA WITH SOME MODIFICATIONS. IN TOTAL, 87% (13 OF 15 ITEMS) OF THE ITEMS IN THE INITIAL MODULE WERE RETAINED, WITH MODIFICATION IN THE REMAINDER AS SUGGESTED BY THE EXPERTS. CONCLUSION: A SPECIFIC YOGA-BASED MODULE FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA WAS DESIGNED AND VALIDATED BY EXPERTS. FURTHER STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM EFFICACY AND CLINICAL UTILITY OF THE MODULE. ADDITIONAL CLINICAL VALIDATION IS SUGGESTED.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
9 1991  29 SPINE FUSIONS, YOGA INSTRUCTORS, AND HIP FRACTURES: THE ROLE OF DUAL MOBILITY IN PRIMARY TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY. BACKGROUND: DESPITE THE INCREASED USE OF DUAL MOBILITY (DM) IN PRIMARY TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY (THA), DEBATE EXISTS REGARDING THE INDICATIONS FOR ITS USE. NO SPECIFIC ALGORITHM EXISTS TO GUIDE THIS DECISION-MAKING PROCESS. THEREFORE, THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO SUMMARIZE THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE LITERATURE REGARDING THE USE OF DM IN PRIMARY THA AND PROVIDE EVIDENCE-BASED GUIDELINES BASED ON SPECIFIC PATIENT POPULATIONS AND RISK FACTORS FOR INSTABILITY. METHODS: WE REVIEWED THE CURRENT LITERATURE FOR STUDIES EVALUATING RISK FACTORS FOR DISLOCATION IN PRIMARY THA, AS WELL AS THE CLINICAL USE AND RESULTS OF DM IN PRIMARY THA. BASED ON THE STRENGTH OF THE LITERATURE, WE DISCUSS THE USE OF DM IN SPECIFIC PATIENT POPULATIONS. WE PROVIDE A DECISION-MAKING ALGORITHM TO DETERMINE WHETHER A PATIENT MAY BE INDICATED FOR DM IN PRIMARY THA. RESULTS: SURGEONS SHOULD CONSIDER PREOPERATIVE PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS, RISK FACTORS FOR INSTABILITY (EG, SIGNIFICANT HIP-SPINE ISSUES), TYPE OF PROCEDURE TO BE PERFORMED (EG, CONVERSION ARTHROPLASTY), AND INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY (EG, THA FOR FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE). BASED ON THIS ALGORITHMIC ASSESSMENT, DM MAY BE WARRANTED IN THE PRIMARY THA SETTING IF A PATIENT'S COMBINED RISK REACHES AN ESTABLISHED THRESHOLD BASED ON THE LITERATURE. CONCLUSION: THIS EVIDENCE-BASED ALGORITHM MAY HELP GUIDE CURRENT PRACTICE IN THE USE OF DM IN PRIMARY THA. WE ADVOCATE THE CONTINUED JUDICIOUS USE OF DM IN HIP ARTHROPLASTY. LONGER TERM STUDIES ARE NEEDED IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE DURABILITY OF DM, AS WELL AS ANY COMPLICATIONS RELATED TO THE DM ARTICULATION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
10  611  31 DEVELOPMENT OF A YOGA MODULE TARGETING CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH FOR PATIENTS WITH POST-MYOCARDIAL LEFT VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION IN INDIA. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS KNOWN TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEED-BASED YOGA PROGRAM WHICH IS SUITABLE TO BE INTEGRATED INTO THE CARDIAC REHABILITATION OF POST-MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION PATIENTS WITH LEFT VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BASED ON THE ASSESSMENT OF THE NEED OF THE PATIENTS, LITERATURE REVIEW, AND EXPERT OPINION, A YOGA MODULE WAS DEVELOPED USING THE QUALITATIVE METHOD OF INQUIRY. THE PROGRAM INCLUDED WARM-UP EXERCISES, YOGIC ASANAS, PRANAYAMA, MEDITATION AND COUNSELING SESSIONS. A STRUCTURED QUESTIONNAIRE ELICITING COMMENTS ON THE CONTENTS WAS GIVEN INDEPENDENTLY TO TEN EXPERTS WORKING IN THE FIELD OF HEALTH AND YOGA FOR VALIDATION. THE FINAL MODULE WAS DERIVED AFTER INCORPORATING THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE EXPERTS. RESULTS: USING THE RATERS' EXPERTISE IN CARDIOLOGY AND YOGA PRACTICE, THE PRACTICES WHICH CONSTITUTE THE MODULE WERE OPTIMIZED. MAJORITY OF THE EXPERTS (RATERS) AGREED WITH THE DURATION OF 1 H TRAINING FOR 1MONTH UNDER SUPERVISION AS ADEQUATE FOR SUBSEQUENT PRACTICE AT HOME. THERE WAS A 0.786 INTER-RATER RELIABILITY ESTIMATED USING THE INTERCLASS COEFFICIENT (ICC) AND 0.789 INTERNAL CONSISTENCY OF THE QUESTIONS, MEASURED USING CRONBACH'S ALPHA. BOTH VALUES INDICATE "GOOD" RELIABILITY AND CONSISTENCY OF THE YOGA MODULE. CONCLUSION: THE DEVELOPED YOGA MODULE WAS FOUND TO BE ACCEPTABLE. FUTURE RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS WILL BE NECESSARY TO VALIDATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS MODULE AND IF THE MODULE DEMONSTRATES TO BE EFFECTIVE BY CLINICAL STUDIES, IT MAY ADD A THERAPEUTIC OPTION IN THE REHABILITATION OF PATIENTS WITH HEART FAILURE FOLLOWING MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, WHICH CAN BE APPLIED IN THE HOSPITALS AND COMMUNITY LEVEL.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
11 2723  34 YOGA MODULE FOR SOMATOFORM PAIN DISORDERS: DEVELOPMENT, CONTENT VALIDATION, AND FEASIBILITY TESTING. BACKGROUND: YOGA PRACTICES HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE USEFUL IN CHRONIC PAIN CONDITIONS BUT STUDIES FOCUSSING SPECIFICALLY ON SOMATOFORM PAIN DISORDERS (SPDS) ARE LIMITED. AIMS: CURRENT STUDY AIMS TO DEVELOP AND TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA PROGRAM FOR PATIENTS WITH SPDS. MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY: ATHOROUGH SEARCH OF TRADITIONAL AND CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE WAS PERFORMED WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF FORMULATING A YOGA PROGRAM FOR REDUCING CHRONIC NON-SPECIFIC PAIN AND ASSOCIATED PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. CONTENT VALIDITY OF THE PROGRAM WAS THEN DETERMINED BY TAKING THE OPINION OF 18 YOGA EXPERTS (WHO HAD >5 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN TREATING MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS) USING CONTENT VALIDATION RATIO (CVR) THROUGH LAWSHE'S FORMULA. THE FEASIBILITY OF THE MODULE WAS TESTED ON 10 SUBJECTS DIAGNOSED WITH SPDS AS PER THE INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES (ICD) -10 CRITERIA USING STANDARD SCALES. RESULTS: IN THE FINALIZED MODULE, 70.83% (34 OUT OF 48 ITEMS) OF THE PRACTICES WERE RETAINED ALONG WITH THE MODIFICATIONS AS SUGGESTED BY THE EXPERTS. TWO PRACTICES WERE NOT FOUND TO BE FEASIBLE (TRIKONASANA AND SHALABHASANA) AND HENCE WERE REMOVED FROM THE FINAL MODULE. A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PAIN SEVERITY WAS OBSERVED IN THE SUBJECTS AFTER PRACTISING THE YOGA MODULE FOR 2 WEEKS. THE CONTENT VALIDITY INDEX FOR THE WHOLE MODULE (AVERAGE OF ALL CVRS) WAS 0.55. CONCLUSIONS: AYOGA MODULE WAS DEVELOPED FOR SPD. THE CONTENT VALIDITY OF THE MODULE WAS FOUND TO BE GOOD. THE MODULE WAS FOUND SAFE AND POTENTIALLY USEFUL FOR REDUCING PAIN SEVERITY IN PATIENTS WITH SPD. FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD TEST THE EFFICACY OF THE DEVELOPED PROGRAM THROUGH A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
12  600  30 DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF 20-MIN YOGA MODULE FOR REDUCING BURNOUT AMONG HEALTHCARE WORKER(S). BACKGROUND: A HIGH PREVALENCE OF BURNOUT HAS BEEN REPORTED AMONG HEALTHCARE WORKER(S). DURING THE CURRENT PANDEMIC, SUCH BURNOUT HAS INCREASED DUE TO EXCESSIVE LOAD OF PATIENT CARE, USE OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) KITS, WORKING IN LONG SHIFTS, STAYING AWAY FROM FAMILY DUE TO ISOLATION NORMS, AND DISRUPTED SOCIAL LIFE. EXISTING YOGA TECHNIQUES USED FOR REDUCING BURNOUT INCLUDE 45 MIN TO HOUR-LONG SESSIONS, WHICH MAY NOT BE FEASIBLE FOR REGULAR PRACTICE BY THE HEALTHCARE WORKER(S). OBJECTIVE: THE PROPOSED STUDY AIMED TO DEVELOP A 20-MIN YOGA MODULE TO REDUCE BURNOUT AMONG HEALTHCARE WORKER(S). METHODS: TO DEVELOP A 20-MIN YOGA MODULE, WE REVIEWED YOGA TEXTS AND RELEVANT SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ARTICLES. COMPONENTS OF THE 20-MIN YOGA MODULE INCLUDE SUKSHMA VYAYAMA (LOOSENING EXERCISES), PRANAYAMA (REGULATED BREATHING), AND DHYANA (MEDITATION). NINETEEN YOGA EXPERTS VALIDATED THE 20-MIN YOGA MODULE WITH AN AVERAGE (SD) OF 11.47 (6.77) YEARS OF RESEARCH AND CLINICAL EXPERIENCE IN YOGA. CONTENT VALIDITY RATIO (CVR) WAS CALCULATED ACCORDING TO LAWSHE'S METHOD. ITEMS HAVING A CVR OF 0.47 AND ABOVE WERE RETAINED IN THE MODULE. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: THE CONTENT VALIDITY INDEX (CVI) OF THE ENTIRE MODULE WAS 0.83. CVR RESULTS OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE 20-MIN YOGA MODULE INDICATED THAT EXPERTS CONSIDER THESE PRACTICES TO BE ESSENTIAL FOR REDUCING BURNOUT AMONG THE HEALTHCARE WORKER(S). THE STRENGTH OF THE 20-MIN YOGA MODULE LIES IN ITS SHORT DURATION AND EASY-TO-LEARN PRACTICES. 20-MIN YOGA MODULE CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN PRACTICE BY THE HEALTHCARE WORKER(S) FOR REDUCING BURNOUT FOLLOWING EFFICACY STUDIES THROUGH FURTHER CLINICAL TRIALS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
13 1773  28 POTENTIAL YOGA MODULES FOR TREATMENT OF HEMATOPOIETIC INHIBITION IN HIV-1 INFECTION. THIS ARTICLE IS EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS UNDERSTANDING THE THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS OF SPECIFIC YOGA MODULES ON THE INHIBITION OF REPLICATION AND ENHANCEMENT TO NORMAL LEVELS OF HEMATOPOIESIS IN HIV-1 INFECTED SUBJECTS. MORE UNIQUE COULD BE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON THE INDIRECT EFFECTS OF HIV-1 INDUCED HEMATOPOIETIC INHIBITION OF THE CD34+ PROGENITOR STEM CELLS, VIA THE CD4+ T LYMPHOCYTES. SUCH INDIRECT EFFECTS MAY BE CAUSED BY HOST CELLULAR FACTORS. YOGA PRACTICES MAY ALSO IMPROVE THE SELF RENEWAL CAPACITY (A STEP THAT PRECEDES COMMITMENT OF CD34+ PROGENITOR CELLS TO TERMINAL DIFFERENTIATION), VIA STAT5 GENE REGULATION. THIS MAY ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR CONSTITUTIVE STAT5 GENE EXPRESSION THROUGH GENE THERAPY. IN THIS ARTICLE RECENT RESEARCH AND ANCIENT INDIAN LITERATURE ARE REVIEWED TO DEVISE YOGA MODULES FOR THE POTENTIAL TREATMENT OF HEMATOPOIETIC INHIBITION IN HIV-1 INFECTION. THE POSSIBLE MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH HEMATOPOIETIC INHIBITION MAY OCCUR IN HIV-1 INFECTED PATIENTS ARE FIRST DESCRIBED FOLLOWED BY THE ROLE OF STRESS IN THE PROGRESSION OF HIV WHERE PROBABLE INVOLVEMENT OF PSYCHO-NEURO-IMMUNOLOGICAL AXIS (PNI) IS HIGHLIGHTED. YOGA THERAPY IS INTRODUCED AND ITS EFFECTIVENESS IN TERMS OF EVIDENCE IN RELEVANT AREA IS REVIEWED. FURTHER, THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY [IAYT] ARE DESCRIBED AND DEPENDING ON THE POTENTIAL MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH YOGA THERAPY MAY ACT, BOTH MODERN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND ANCIENT "SCRIPTURAL" EVIDENCE ARE PROVIDED AT ALL THE FIVE LEVELS OF EXISTENCE (BODY, LIFE FORCE, EMOTIONAL, INTELLECTUAL AND BLISS). THIS WILL ENABLE TO DESIGN COMPREHENSIVE YOGA MODULES THAT MAY INTERVENE IN THIS INDIRECT INHIBITION OF HAEMATOPOIESIS IN HIV-1 INFECTED INDIVIDUALS AND POTENTIALLY RESTORE NORMAL LEVELS OF HAEMATOPOIESIS.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
14  580  27 DESIGNING AND VALIDATION OF A YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION FOR OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER. SOME YOGA-BASED PRACTICES HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE USEFUL FOR PATIENTS WITH OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD). THE AUTHORS COULD NOT FIND A VALIDATED YOGA THERAPY MODULE AVAILABLE FOR OCD. THIS STUDY ATTEMPTED TO FORMULATE A GENERIC YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION MODULE FOR OCD. A YOGA MODULE WAS DESIGNED BASED ON TRADITIONAL AND CONTEMPORARY YOGA LITERATURE. THE MODULE WAS SENT TO 10 YOGA EXPERTS FOR CONTENT VALIDATION. THE EXPERTS RATED THE USEFULNESS OF THE PRACTICES ON A SCALE OF 1-5 (5 = EXTREMELY USEFUL). THE FINAL VERSION OF THE MODULE WAS PILOT-TESTED ON PATIENTS WITH OCD (N = 17) FOR BOTH FEASIBILITY AND EFFECT ON SYMPTOMS. EIGHTY-EIGHT PER CENT (22 OUT OF 25) OF THE ITEMS IN THE INITIAL MODULE WERE RETAINED, WITH MODIFICATIONS IN THE MODULE AS SUGGESTED BY THE EXPERTS ALONG WITH PATIENTS' INPUTS AND AUTHORS' EXPERIENCE. THE MODULE WAS FOUND TO BE FEASIBLE AND SHOWED AN IMPROVEMENT IN SYMPTOMS OF OCD ON TOTAL YALE-BROWN OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE SCALE (YBOCS) SCORE (P = 0.001). A GENERIC YOGA THERAPY MODULE FOR OCD WAS VALIDATED BY EXPERTS IN THE FIELD AND FOUND FEASIBLE TO PRACTICE IN PATIENTS. A DECREASE IN THE SYMPTOM SCORES WAS ALSO FOUND FOLLOWING YOGA PRACTICE OF 2 WEEKS. FURTHER CLINICAL VALIDATION IS WARRANTED TO CONFIRM EFFICACY.	2016

16  584  32 DESIGNING, VALIDATION, AND FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA MODULE FOR PATIENTS WITH ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS. BACKGROUND: ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS (AS) IS A CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE THAT CAUSES SIGNIFICANT DISABILITY AND REDUCED QUALITY OF LIFE. SCIENTIFIC STUDIES ON YOGA HAVE REVEALED ITS VARIOUS HEALTH BENEFITS IN CHRONIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES. HOWEVER, WHETHER YOGA IS FEASIBLE FOR AS PATIENTS OR NOT IS NOT STUDIED. FURTHER, NO VALIDATED YOGA MODULE IS AVAILABLE FOR AS PATIENTS. OBJECTIVE(S): THIS STUDY INTENDED TO DEVELOP A YOGA MODULE FOR AS PATIENTS AND INVESTIGATED ITS FEASIBILITY OF USE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE STUDY WAS COMPLETED IN THREE STAGES. IN STAGE I, SIX YOGA EXPERTS PREPARED A LIST OF 64 YOGA PRACTICES BASED ON THE CLASSICAL AND CONTEMPORARY YOGIC LITERATURE REVIEW. OF THESE PRACTICES, 41 WERE INCLUDED IN THE DESIGNED YOGA MODULE. IN STAGE II, 41 EXPERTS WITH A MINIMUM OF FIVE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN YOGA THERAPY WERE INVITED FOR YOGA MODULE VALIDATION. THE USEFULNESS OF THE PRACTICES WAS RATED BY EXPERTS ON A 3-POINT SCALE (1: NOT AT ALL USEFUL, 2: MODERATELY USEFUL, AND 3: VERY MUCH USEFUL). THE LAWSHE CONTENT VALIDITY RATIO (CVR) METHOD WAS USED FOR THE CONTENT VALIDITY OF THE YOGA MODULE. PRACTICES WITH A CVR SCORE OF > 0.3 WERE RETAINED IN THE FINAL YOGA MODULE. IN STAGE III, A CERTIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTOR ADMINISTERED THE VALIDATED YOGA MODULE TO 19 AS PATIENTS (AVERAGE AGE: 35.5 +/- 10.7 YEARS) THRICE WEEKLY FOR A MONTH. FEASIBILITY WAS ASSESSED ON THE BASIS OF THE ATTRITION RATE, RETENTION RATE, ATTENDANCE OF THE PARTICIPANTS, AND THE SUBJECTIVE RESPONSE ON PRACTICAL SESSIONS USING A STRUCTURED CHECKLIST. RESULTS: OF THE 41 PRACTICES IN THE MODULE, 31 HAD A CVR SCORE OF > 0.3 AND WERE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL YOGA MODULE. OF THE 25 PARTICIPANTS, 19 (76%) COMPLETED THE STUDY WHILE SIX DROPPED OUT (24%). NINETEEN PATIENTS REPORTED GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN PAIN AND FLEXIBILITY. THEY FOUND YOGA RELAXING AND EASY TO PRACTICE. MOST PARTICIPANTS (65%) WERE ABLE TO PRACTICE A MINIMUM OF 30 MIN/DAY. CONCLUSION: THE PRESENT STUDY OFFERS A VALIDATED YOGA MODULE CONSISTING OF 31 PRACTICES FOR AS PATIENTS. THE RESULTS OF THE PILOT SUGGESTED THAT THE MODULE IS FEASIBLE, ACCEPTABLE, AND EASY TO PRACTICE FOR AS PATIENTS.

17  374  38 AYURVEDA BODY-MIND CONSTITUTIONAL TYPES AND ROLE OF YOGA INTERVENTION AMONG TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS POPULATION OF CHANDIGARH AND PANCHKULA REGIONS. BACKGROUND: TYPE 2 DIABETES NEEDS A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF ETIOLOGICAL FACTORS AND MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES BASED ON LIFESTYLE AND CONSTITUTIONAL FACTORS, GIVEN ITS HIGH ASSOCIATION RATE WITH MANY CARDIOVASCULAR, NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS, AND COVID-19 INFECTION. PURPOSE: THE PRESENT STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF DIABETES-SPECIFIC INTEGRATED YOGA LIFESTYLE PROTOCOL (DYP) ON GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND LIPID PROFILES OF DIABETIC ADULTS. ALONG WITH THE DYP INTERVENTION, THE INDIVIDUALS RESIDING IN CHANDIGARH AND PANCHKULA UNION TERRITORIES IN THE NORTHERN PART OF INDIA WERE ASSESSED FOR AYURVEDA-BASED BODY-MIND CONSTITUTIONAL TYPE. AYURVEDA DESCRIBES BODY-MIND CONSTITUTION AS "PRAKRITI," WHICH HAS BEEN DISCUSSED FROM TWO ANGLES, NAMELY PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL AS BODY AND MIND ARE CORRELATED. METHODS: CLUSTER SAMPLING OF WAITLIST CONTROL STUDY SUBJECTS WAS USED AS THE SAMPLING METHOD FOR THE STUDY. A TOTAL OF 1,215 REGISTERED SUBJECTS (81 DIABETIC) RESPONDED IN RANDOMLY SELECTED CLUSTERS IN CHANDIGARH AND PANCHKULA. AYURVEDA PHYSICIANS DID AYURVEDA BODY-MIND CONSTITUTIONAL ASSESSMENT CALLED PRAKRITI ASSESSMENT (PHYSIOLOGICAL BODY-MIND CONSTITUTION ASSESSMENT) IN 35 PARTICIPANTS (23 DIABETIC, 12 PREDIABETIC) AS A PART OF THE STUDY. RESULTS: A GROUP OF 50 SUBJECTS WAS RANDOMLY SELECTED FOR YOGA INTERVENTION OUT OF 81 DIABETES MELLITUS ADULTS, AND 31 SUBJECTS WERE ENROLLED AS WAITLIST CONTROLS. A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN LEVELS FROM 8.49 +/- 1.94% TO 7.97 +/- 2.20% IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP WAS NOTICED. THE LIPID PROFILES OF THE DYP INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS WERE MONITORED. THREE-MONTH FOLLOW-UP RESULTS OF LIPID PROFILE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS IN INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS (P < 0.05). MOST DIABETIC AND PREDIABETIC INDIVIDUALS WERE FOUND TO HAVE PITTA DOSHA (PITTA CONTROLS ALL HEAT, METABOLISM, AND TRANSFORMATION IN THE MIND AND BODY) AS DOMINANT CONSTITUTION TYPE. CONCLUSION: THE STUDY RESULTS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN DIABETIC INDIVIDUALS. THIS STUDY HAS INDICATED THE EVIDENCE FOR THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THE VALIDATED DYP FOR COMMUNITY-LEVEL INTERVENTIONS TO PREVENT MALADIES LIKE BRAIN DAMAGE AND STROKE.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
18  596  33 DEVELOPMENT AND FEASIBILITY OF YOGA THERAPY MODULE FOR OUT-PATIENTS WITH DEPRESSION IN INDIA. CONTEXT: EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT CERTAIN YOGA PRACTICES ARE USEFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF DEPRESSION. TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, THERE HAS BEEN NO STUDY THAT DEALS WITH THE FORMULATION OF A YOGA MODULE FOR THE PARTICULAR CLINICAL FEATURES OF DEPRESSION. AIM: THE MAIN AIM OF OUR STUDY WAS TO DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE YOGA THERAPY MODULE TARGETING SPECIFIC CLINICAL FEATURES OF DEPRESSION. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: SPECIFIC YOGA PRACTICES WERE MATCHED FOR CLINICAL FEATURES OF DEPRESSION BASED ON A THOROUGH LITERATURE REVIEW. A YOGA PROGRAM WAS DEVELOPED, WHICH CONSISTED OF SUKSMAVYAYAMA, (LOOSENING EXERCISES), ASANAS (POSTURES), RELAXATION TECHNIQUES, PRANAYAMA (BREATHING EXERCISES) AND CHANTING MEDITATION TO BE TAUGHT IN A 2 WEEK PERIOD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A STRUCTURED QUESTIONNAIRE WAS DEVELOPED FOR VALIDATION FROM NINE EXPERIENCED YOGA PROFESSIONALS. THE FINAL VERSION OF YOGA THERAPY MODULE WAS PILOT-TESTED ON SEVEN PATIENTS (FIVE FEMALES) WITH DEPRESSION RECRUITED FROM OUTPATIENT SERVICE OF NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH AND NEURO SCIENCES, BANGALORE. RESULTS: THE FINAL YOGA THERAPY MODULE HAD THOSE PRACTICES THAT RECEIVED A SCORE OF THREE OR MORE (MODERATELY/VERY MUCH/EXTREMELY USEFUL) FROM ALL RESPONDERS. SIX OUT OF NINE (>65%) EXPERTS SUGGESTED SUKSMAVYAYAMA SHOULD BE INCLUDED. FIVE OUT OF NINE EXPERTS OPINED THAT TRAINING WITH 10 SESSIONS (OVER 2 WEEKS) IS RATHER SHORT. ALL EXPERTS OPINED THAT THE MODULE IS EASY TO TEACH, LEARN AND PRACTICE. AT THE PILOT STAGE, THE FIVE PATIENTS WHO COMPLETED THE MODULE REPORTED MORE THAN 80% SATISFACTION ABOUT THE YOGA PRACTICES AND HOW THE YOGA WAS TAUGHT. SEVERITY OF DEPRESSION SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED AT BOTH 1 AND 3 MONTHS FOLLOW-UP. CONCLUSION: THE DEVELOPED COMPREHENSIVE YOGA THERAPY MODULE WAS VALIDATED BY EXPERTS IN THE FIELD AND WAS FOUND TO BE FEASIBLE AND USEFUL IN PATIENTS WITH DEPRESSION.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
19  921  23 EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AS THE PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION MODULE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES AND DIABETES ASSOCIATED DEMENTIA IN SOUTH EAST ASIA: A NARRATIVE REVIEW. BACKGROUND: DIABETES MELLITUS (DM) IS WIDELY SPREAD IN SOUTH ASIAN (ASEAN) AND INDIAN SUB-CONTINENT. THE INCREASING HEALTHCARE COSTS OF DM CAN BE PREVENTED IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD BY IMPROVED PUBLIC HEALTHCARE INTERVENTIONS. MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS OF DM LIKE SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE, OBESITY, AND STRESSFUL CONDITIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ITS PROGRESSION; HOWEVER, THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA COLLECTED BY PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS ARE LIMITED. SUMMARY: A REVIEW OF PUBLISHED LITERATURE DESCRIBING GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF DM AND ASSOCIATED DEMENTIA IN SOUTH ASIAN REGION, PARTICULARLY INDIA, WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE PURPOSE OF ASSESSING THE FEASIBILITY AND CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE YOGA-BASED RISK REDUCTION. PUBMED AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR DM AND DEMENTIA-RELATED ARTICLES BY USING A COMBINATION OF KEYWORDS: DIABETES, DIABETES RELATED DEMENTIA SOUTHEAST ASIA, PRE-DIABETES, YOGA, LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION, DEMENTIA AND EXERCISE. THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA GENERATED FROM THESE DISEASES HAVE NOT PROMPTED TO ANY MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH POLICIES. YOGA CAN BE A COST-EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR THE PREVENTION OF TYPE 2 DM (T2DM) AND ITS ASSOCIATED COGNITIVE DECLINE WHEN DETECTED EARLY. IF NATIONWIDE INTERVENTION OF YOGA IS BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE STATE, ITS INTEGRATION IN HEALTH CARE WILL BECOME MORE MEANINGFUL AND ACCEPTABLE. KEY MESSAGE: STUDIES SUGGEST THAT YOGA AND CHANGE IN LIFESTYLE CAN MODIFY THE HEALTH RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH T2DM AND ASSOCIATED DEMENTIA IF IT IS MAINSTREAMED WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH INITIATIVE OF AYUSHMAN BHARAT SCHEME.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
20  568  25 DECODING THE INTEGRATED APPROACH TO YOGA THERAPY: QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE BASED CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK. AIM: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DEFINE, DECODE, AND APPEND TO THE CONCEPTUAL FRAME-WORK OF THE INTEGRATED APPROACH TO YOGA THERAPY (IAYT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: FOUR STAKEHOLDERS WHO FOLLOWED TWO IN-PATIENTS WITH DEPRESSION OVER A PERIOD OF 2 WEEKS IN THE RESIDENTIAL CENTER AROGYADHAMA (OF SWAMI VIVEKANANDA YOGA ANUSANDANA SAMSTHANA, BANGALORE, INDIA) WERE INTERVIEWED BEFORE THE START OF THE IAYT TREATMENT AND PRIOR TO DISCHARGE OF THE PATIENT. THE PATIENTS WERE ALSO INTERVIEWED PRE AND POST AND WERE OBSERVED ONCE DURING THEIR SESSION. THE DATA FROM THE AUDIO RECORDINGS FROM EIGHT IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WERE TRANSCRIBED MANUALLY AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED. RESULTS: THE CONCEPTUAL FRAME-WORK OF IAYT DEPICTS THAT PATIENT RELATED FACTORS ("CO-OPERATION OF PATIENT", "PATIENTS AWARENESS OF HIS/HER CONDITION"), THERAPIST RELATED FACTORS ("ABILITY TO GUIDE", "THE ASSISTANCE TO THE PATIENTS", "EXPLANATION OF THE EXERCISES") AND TREATMENT RELATED FACTORS ("COMBINATION OF PSYCHIATRIC OR AYURVEDIC MEDICATION WITH YOGA", "COUNSELING DURING THE IAYT TREATMENT", DURATION OF TREATMENT), PLAY AN INTEGRATED ROLE IN REACHING THE "AIM OF IAYT" AND EXPERIENCING "IMPROVEMENTS AND CHANGES". CONCLUSION: THE IAYT IS A HOLISTIC PROGRAM AND THE ABILITY OF THE PATIENT TO COOPERATE WITH AND INTEGRATE THE AVAILABLE FACTORS (THERAPIST RELATED AND TREATMENT RELATED) COULD ENABLE BEST RESULTS.	2014

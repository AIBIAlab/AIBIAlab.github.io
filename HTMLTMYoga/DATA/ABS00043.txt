1   43 90 A CASE REPORT OF PATIENT PRACTISING YOGA LEADING TO DENTAL EROSION. THE ARTICLE PRESENTS THE CASE OF A PATIENT WHO WAS PRACTISING YOGA (KUNJAL KRIYA) WHICH LED TO DENTAL EROSION. DENTAL EROSION CAN BE DUE TO EXTRINSIC OR INTRINSIC CAUSES. THE INTRINSIC CAUSES INCLUDE VOMITING DUE TO ANOREXIA NERVOSA, REGURGITATION DUE TO ABNORMALITY IN GASTRO-INTESTINAL TRACT OR RUMINATION. A 38-YEAR-OLD MALE PATIENT PRESENTED WITH A RARE AETIOLOGY OF DENTAL EROSION. HE HAD PRACTICED KUNJAL KRIYA ONE OF THE YOGIC EXERCISES DESCRIBED IN ANCIENT INDIA. IN KUNJAL KRIYA THE PATIENT VOMITS ON AN EMPTY STOMACH IN ORDER TO CLEAN HIS OR HER GASTRO-INTESTINAL TRACT. THE PATIENT HAD PRACTICED THIS FORM OF EXERCISE FOR OVER 12 YEARS WHICH HAD LED TO SEVERE DENTAL EROSION. A PROPER CASE HISTORY SHOULD BE EVALUATED FOR EVERY PATIENT SO THAT THEY CAN BE COUNSELLED FOR ANY FACTORS THAT COULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO DENTAL HEALTH. EARLY DIAGNOSIS IS PARAMOUNT IN RECOGNISING THE AETIOLOGY OF DENTAL EROSION SO THAT DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON THE DENTITION CAN BE PREVENTED.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
2 2911 23 [PSEUDOARTHROSIS OF THE FIRST RIB IN A PATIENT WHO PRACTICES YOGA. A CASE REPORT]. INTRODUCTION: PSEUDOARTHROSIS OF THE FIRST RIB IS A RARE CONDITION THAT MAY OCCUR IN ATHLETES AS A RESULT OF REPETITIVE ACTIVITIES, MAINLY OVERHEAD. THE USUAL CLINICAL PRESENTATION IS PAIN IN THE NECK OR THE IPSILATERAL SHOULDER. CASE REPORT: THIS IS THE CASE OF A 19-YEAR-OLD FEMALE PATIENT WHO HAD SUDDEN PAIN OF THE BASE OF THE NECK WHILE DOING YOGA. PSEUDOARTHROSIS OF THE FIRST RIB WAS DIAGNOSED WITH X-RAYS AND CAT SCAN. TREATMENT CONSISTED OF A REHABILITATION AND PHYSICAL THERAPY PROGRAM THAT WAS SUCCESSFUL DESPITE THE PERSISTENCE OF THE PSEUDOARTHROSIS. DISCUSSION: CASES OF FIRST RIB FRACTURES HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN ATHLETES PRACTICING MULTIPLE ACTIVITIES; HOWEVER, PSEUDOARTHROSIS CASES ARE RARE SINCE MOST OF THEM PROGRESS TO BONE HEALING. THIS IS THE FIRST REPORTED CASE OF A FRACTURE OR PSEUDOARTHROSIS IN A PATIENT PRACTICING YOGA. AS IN MOST REPORTED CASES, CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT WAS SUCCESSFUL. CONCLUSION: FRACTURES AND PSEUDOARTHROSIS OF THE FIRST RIB ARE RARE IN ATHLETES AND SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF ATHLETES PRESENTING WITH SHOULDER AND NECK PAIN. CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT IS SUCCESSFUL IN MOST CASES.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
3 2363 23 VOLUNTARILY INDUCED VOMITING - A YOGA TECHNIQUE TO ENHANCE PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN HEALTHY HUMANS. VOMITING IS A COMPLEX AUTONOMIC REFLEX ORCHESTRATED BY SEVERAL NEUROLOGICAL CENTRES IN THE BRAIN. VAGUS, THE CRANIAL NERVE PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN REGULATION OF VOMITING. KUNJAL KRIYA (VOLUNTARILY INDUCED VOMITING), IS A YOGIC CLEANSING TECHNIQUE WHICH INVOLVES VOLUNTARILY INDUCING VOMITING AFTER DRINKING SALINE WATER (5%) ON EMPTY STOMACH. THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED WITH AN OBJECTIVE TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECT OF VOLUNTARY INDUCED VOMITING (VIV) ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN EXPERIENCED PRACTITIONERS AND NOVICES AND DERIVE ITS POSSIBLE THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS. EIGHTEEN HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS VOLUNTEERED FOR THE STUDY OF WHICH NINE HAD PRIOR EXPERIENCE OF VIV WHILE NINE DID NOT. PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS WERE PERFORMED BEFORE AND AFTER 10 MIN OF REST FOLLOWING VIV. ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE WAS PERFORMED ADJUSTED FOR GENDER AND BASELINE VALUES. NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE OBSERVED ACROSS GENDERS. THE RESULTS OF THE PRESENT STUDY SUGGEST A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SLOW VITAL CAPACITY [F(1,13) = 5.699; P = 0.03] AND FORCED INSPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1ST SECOND [P = 0.02] AND REDUCTION IN EXPIRATORY RESERVE VOLUME [F(1,13) = 5.029; P = 0.04] AND RESPIRATORY RATE [F(1,13) = 3.244, P = 0.09]. THESE CHANGES SUGGEST THE POSSIBLE ROLE OF VIV IN ENHANCING THE ENDURANCE OF THE RESPIRATORY MUSCLES, DECREASED AIRWAY RESISTANCE, BETTER EMPTYING OF LUNGS AND VAGAL PREDOMINANCE RESPECTIVELY. WE CONCLUDE THAT VIV WHEN PRACTICED REGULARLY ENHANCES THE ENDURANCE OF THE RESPIRATORY MUSCLES AND DECREASES AIRWAY RESISTANCE. THESE FINDINGS ALSO INDICATE NEED FOR SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF VIV IN THE MANAGEMENT OF MOTION SICKNESS AND RESTRICTIVE PULMONARY DISORDERS LIKE BRONCHITIS AND BRONCHIAL ASTHMA.	2018	
                                                            
4 1570 26 MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE CALCULUS CHOLECYSTITIS WITH INTEGRATED AYURVEDA AND YOGA INTERVENTION: A CASE REPORT. ACUTE CALCULUS CHOLECYSTITIS (ACC) IS A FREQUENTLY REPORTED MEDICAL CONDITION IN GENERAL PRACTICE. APPROXIMATELY 20% OF PATIENTS WITH GALLBLADDER STONES EXPERIENCE ACC IN THEIR LIFETIME. AYURVEDA AND YOGA ARE ANCIENT TRADITIONAL SYSTEMS OF MEDICINE USED FOR TREATMENT OF DISEASES AND IMPROVING AND MAINTAINING HEALTH. THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASED USE OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SEVERAL HEALTH CONDITIONS IN INDIA AND WORLDWIDE. THE PRESENT CASE STUDY IS OF 34 YEARS FEMALE PATIENT WHO HAD ACC. POST DIAGNOSIS OF ACC PATIENT WAS ADVISED TO UNDERGO CHOLECYSTECTOMY; HOWEVER, SHE APPROACHED ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES WITH C/O VOMITING, NAUSEA, ABDOMINAL PAIN, JAUNDICE, ITCHING, AND ABDOMINAL BLOATING WITH DERANGED LIVER FUNCTIONS. AYURVEDA AND YOGA INTERVENTION PROTOCOL WAS DESIGNED. AYURVEDA TREATMENT CONSISTED OF MILD PURGATION (MRUDUVIRECHANA) WITH TRIVRITTALEHYAM FOR CONSECUTIVE SEVEN DAYS, FOLLOWED BY ORAL ADMINISTRATION OF TAB LIV 52, BHUNIMBADI KADHA TWICE DAILY, AND AMALAKI RASAYANA IN THE MORNING FOR 45 DAYS. PATIENTS RECEIVED 8 TELEYOGA SESSIONS OVER A PERIOD OF 45 DAYS. A THERAPEUTIC DIET WAS ADVISED DURING TREATMENT PERIOD. AFTER TWO MONTHS PATIENT REPORTED COMPLETE RECOVERY IN SYMPTOMS, AND ALL LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS REACHED TO NORMAL RANGE. THIS CASE STUDY SUGGESTS THE POSITIVE ROLE OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA INTERVENTION IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ACC. THIS CASE REPORT WARRANTS FUTURE CLINICAL STUDIES ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE IN ACC.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
5 2396 15 YOGA AND CHEMOREFLEX RESPONSE TO HYPOXIA AND HYPERCAPNIA. WE TESTED WHETHER CHEMOREFLEX SENSITIVITY COULD BE AFFECTED BY THE PRACTICE OF YOGA, AND WHETHER THIS IS SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF A SLOW BREATHING RATE OBTAINED DURING YOGA OR AS A GENERAL CONSEQUENCE OF YOGA. WE FOUND THAT SLOW BREATHING RATE PER SE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED CHEMOREFLEX SENSITIVITY, BUT LONG-TERM YOGA PRACTICE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR A GENERALISED REDUCTION IN CHEMOREFLEX.	2000

7 2913 15 [RELATION BETWEEN YOGA AND PSYCHOTHERAPY]. WESTERN PSYCHOTHERAPY AND YOGA OVERLAP INSOFAR AS BOTH SYSTEMS ARE BASED UPON RELIGIOUS AND MYTHOLOGICAL FACTS, AND--ON THE LEVEL OF PSYCHOTHERAPEUTICAL PRAXIS--ON THE TECHNICS OF HYPNOSIS, AUTO- AND HETEROSUGGESTIONS AND/OR MEDITATION. IT IS 50 YEARS AGO THAT THE WEST CONSIDERED THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTICAL EFFECTS OF THEAYOGA-SYSTEMS, FIRST OF ALL OF HATHA- YOGA. EVEN TODAY A THEORETICAL FOUNDATION BY MEANS OF PROPER COMPARISON OF THE TWO STRUCTURES IS MISSING. IN PRESENT-DAY INDIA YOGA FULFILLS PSYCHOHYGIENICAL FUNCTIONS WITHOUT BEING A PSYCHOTHERAPY IN OUR SENSE. THERE ARE VARIOUS TECHNIQUES OF MAGIC IN USE, WHICH REPLACE THE EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGICAL-PSYCHOTHERAPEUTICAL METHODS IN THE WEST. THE ACCEPTANCE OF MEDITATION COULD ONLY BE SUCCESSFUL IF THE METAPHYSICAL AND SOCIOCULTURAL CONTEXT WOULD BE INTEGRATED AT THE SAME TIME. THE TRADITIONAL FUNCTION OF YOGA GUARANTEES ITS CONTINUITY EVEN IN THE MODERN INDUSTRIALIZED SOCIETY OF INDIA. NEITHER THE THEORETICAL NOR THE PRATICAL FUNDAMENTS ALLOW A DIRECT TRANSFER AT PRESENT.	1980

THIS ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSIOPHILOSOPHICAL FUNDAMENTALS AND GENESIS OF TSIGUN, INDIAN, AND TIBETAN YOGA BASED ON THE OVERVIEW OF THE RELEVANT LITERATURE WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE METHODOLOGY OF THESE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL DISCIPLINES AND THEIR THERAPEUTIC AND HEALTH-GIVING EFFICACY. BASED ON THE COMBINATION OF PHYSIOPHILOSOPHICAL CATEGORIES AND MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE CONCEPT OF THE FIVE PRIMARY ELEMENTS, THE AUTHORS ILLUSTRATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEMIC APPROACH BY WHICH ANCIENT PHYSICIANS RELATED MAN TO NATURE IN ORDER TO DERIVE THE ADAPTATION PRINCIPLE REALIZED THROUGH HUMAN ACTIVITIES. TRADITIONAL AND MODERN ASPECTS OF THESE ACTIVITIES ARE CONSIDERED. IN THE TRADITIONAL CONTEXT, THE PERFORMANCE OF EXERCISES AS ASSIGNED BY TSIGUN, INDIAN, AND TIBETAN YOGA IS CONSIDERED AS THE PURPOSEFUL REALIZATION OF THE ENERGY OF CONSCIENCE FOR HEALTH IMPROVEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT AND IN THE MODERN CONTEXT AS THE REALIZATION OF A NOVEL FORM OF PSYCHIC CREATIVE CAPACITY TO THE SAME EFFECT BASED ON FRUITFUL BRAINWORK.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
11 2324 25 TREATMENT OF ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION WITH YOGA RELAXATION THERAPY IN A USAF AVIATOR: A CASE REPORT. A 46-YEAR-OLD CAUCASIAN MALE USAF AVIATOR WITH A 6-YEAR HISTORY OF MILD ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION (MEDICAL WAIVER FOR FLIGHT DUTY) UNDER UNSUCCESSFUL TREATMENT WITH HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE, DIETARY MODIFICATION, AND EXERCISE, WAS SUBSEQUENTLY TRAINED IN YOGA RELAXATION. AFTER 6 WEEKS, MEDICATION HAD BEEN DISCONTINUED, AND HIS DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE REMAINED WITHIN NORMAL LEVELS. THE PATIENT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY RETURNED TO FULL FLIGHT STATUS WITHOUT RECURRENCE OF DIASTOLIC HYPERTENSION AT FOLLOWUP 6 MONTHS LATER. RELAXATION TRAINING, OF WHICH YOGA IS ONE TYPE, HAS BEEN REPORTED IN THE MEDICAL LITERATURE TO HAVE WIDE CLINICAL APPLICATION. IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A NONPHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPY ADJUNCT OR ALTERNATIVE FOR MEDICAL DISORDERS AMONG PERSONNEL IN OCCUPATIONS (E.G., AVIATION) WHERE THE SIDE EFFECTS FROM MEDICATIONS ARE OF GREAT CONCERN AND COULD BE DISQUALIFYING FROM THOSE DUTIES.	1989

IN THIS ARTICLE I FOCUS ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONCEPTS OF SELF AND HEALTH IN MODERN NORTH INDIA. DRAWING ON FIELD RESEARCH IN A POPULAR YOGA SOCIETY, I ARGUE THAT YOGA THERAPY, AS PRACTICED BY THE BHARATIYA YOG SANSTHAN OF DELHI, PROVIDES A RECONCEPTUALIZATION OF WHAT CAN BE MEANT BY PUBLIC HEALTH. USING STUDIES THAT CHALLENGE BOTH THE ESSENTIALIST AND EPISTEMOLOGICAL FACTICITY OF THE SELF, I SHOW HOW THE DISCOURSE AND PRACTICE OF YOGA IS IMPLICATED IN, AND DERIVED FROM, A COMPLEX SEARCH FOR SELF DEFINITION IN TERMS OF HEALTH; HEALTH WHICH IS CONCEIVED OF AS A PUBLIC REGIMEN THAT SEEKS TO RECONNECT THAT WHICH MODERNITY HAS BROKEN APART: MIND AND BODY.	1997

THIS PAPER AIMS TO SHOW THAT AN AGE-OLD YOGA PRACTICE, CALLED UDDHYANA BHANDA AND NOULI, IS AN EFFECTIVE MEANS OF CORE STABILITY.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
15 2887 23 YOGA: CAN IT BE INTEGRATED WITH TREATMENT OF NEUROPATHIC PAIN? BACKGROUND: NEUROPATHIC PAIN (NP) IS A DEBILITATING CONDITION THAT MAY RESULT FROM SPINAL CORD INJURY (SCI). NEARLY 75% OF ALL SCI RESULTS IN NP AFFECTING 17,000 NEW INDIVIDUALS IN THE UNITED STATES EVERY YEAR, AND AN ESTIMATED 7-10% OF PEOPLE WORLDWIDE. IT IS CAUSED BY DAMAGED OR DYSFUNCTIONAL NERVE FIBERS SENDING ABERRANT SIGNALS TO PAIN CENTERS IN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM CAUSING SEVERE PAIN THAT AFFECTS DAILY LIFE AND ROUTINE. THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING NP ARE NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD, MAKING TREATMENT DIFFICULT. IDENTIFICATION OF SPECIFIC MOLECULAR PATHWAYS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN PAIN SYNDROMES AND FINDING EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS HAS BECOME A MAJOR PRIORITY IN CURRENT SCI RESEARCH. YOGA HAS THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS MAY PROVE BENEFICIAL IN TREATING SUBJECTS SUFFERING CHRONICALLY WITH SCI INDUCED NP, CHRONIC BACK AND ASSOCIATED PAINS IF NECESSARY EXPERIMENTAL DATA IS GENERATED. SUMMARY: THIS REVIEW AIMS TO DISCUSS THE IMPLICATIONS OF VARIOUS MECHANISTIC APPROACHES OF YOGA WHICH CAN BE TESTED BY NEW STUDY DESIGNS AROUND VARIOUS NOCICEPTIVE MOLECULES INCLUDING MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASES (MMPS), CATION-DEPENDENT CHLORIDE TRANSPORTER (NKCC1) ETC IN SCI INDUCED NP PATIENTS. KEY MESSAGES: THUS, YOGIC PRACTICES COULD BE USED IN MANAGING SCI INDUCED NP PAIN BY REGULATING THE ACTION OF VARIOUS MECHANISMS AND ITS ASSOCIATED MOLECULES. MODERN PRESCRIPTIVE TREATMENT STRATEGIES COMBINED WITH ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES LIKE YOGA SHOULD BE USED IN REHABILITATION CENTERS AND CLINICS IN ORDER TO AMELIORATE CHRONIC NP. WE RECOMMEND PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS OF CAREFUL YOGA PRACTICE AS PART OF AN INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE APPROACH FOR NP ASSOCIATED WITH SCI.	2019	
                                                                                                                               
16 2248 14 THE ISLAMIC PRAYER (SALAH/NAMAAZ) AND YOGA TOGETHERNESS IN MENTAL HEALTH. RELIGION AND ITS PRACTICES HAVE BEEN DULY IMPLICATED IN TREATING NOT ONLY PROBLEMS RELATED TO MEDICAL HEALTH, RATHER, INTERVENING AND PREVENTING SUCH PROBLEMS AS WELL. IN THE PRESENT ARTICLE, THE AUTHORS HAVE REVIEWED SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ISLAMIC PRAYERS (SALAH/NAMAAZ) IN HEALTHCARE IN GENERAL AND MENTAL HEALTH IN PARTICULAR. THE NATURE, PROCEDURES, PRACTICES AND THE BENEFITS OF SALAH HAVE BEEN COMPREHENSIVELY DESCRIBED AND DISCUSSED. IN ADDITION, AN ATTEMPT TO COMBINE YOGA AND ITS PRACTICES WITH SALAH HAS BEEN MADE FOR INTERVENING AND PREVENTING THE PROBLEMS OF MENTAL HEALTH AS AN EXPEDITIOUS TOOL. IN UPSHOT, THE CLINICIANS IN THE FIELD OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED TO INCORPORATE THESE TWO VIEWPOINTS IN THEIR INTERVENTION PROGRAM, AT LEAST, FOR THE MUSLIM PATIENTS FOR A MORE DESIRABLE OUTCOME.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
17 1754 10 PLACE OF NUTRITION IN YOGA. NUTRITION PLAYS A VERY VITAL ROLE IN OUR LIFE. YOGA AND AYURVEDA HAD LAID DOWN THE FOUNDATIONS OF DIETETICS. THE VALUABLE GUIDELINES REGARDING VARIOUS FOOD ARTICLES AND DIET FOR YOGA SADHAKA, TO ACHIEVE MAXIMUM BENEFITS, ARE GIVEN IN TRADITIONAL YOGA TEXTS LIKE HATHA PRADIPIKA AND GHERANDA SAMHITHA.

20 2399 25 YOGA AND CUTANEOUS FUNCTIONAL UNIT RECRUITMENT FOR A PATIENT WITH CERVICAL AND UPPER EXTREMITY BURN SCAR CONTRACTURE: CASE REPORT. BURN SCAR CONTRACTURE GREATLY LIMITS FUNCTION FOR BURN SURVIVORS, PARTICULARLY WHEN THE SCARRING CROSSES MULTIPLE JOINTS. PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS IDENTIFIED FIELDS OF SKIN RECRUITED DURING SINGLE JOINT MOTION, CALLED CUTANEOUS FUNCTIONAL UNITS (CFU), INDICATING THAT IMPAIRMENTS MAY BE SEEN DISTAL TO THE INJURED TISSUE. THIS CASE REPORT CONNECTS THE PRINCIPLES OF CFU AND YOGA-INSPIRED THERAPY MODALITIES IN IMPROVING CLINICAL OUTCOMES FOR A BURN SURVIVOR. THE PATIENT IS A 38-YEAR-OLD MALE WHO SUSTAINED DEEP PARTIAL-THICKNESS ELECTRICAL BURNS TO HIS NECK, CHEST, AND BILATERAL UPPER EXTREMITIES, PRESENTING WITH SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED RANGE OF MOTION. THE PATIENT ATTENDED PHYSICAL THERAPY 4 DAYS A WEEK, WHERE HE PERFORMED A SPECIFIC YOGA ASANA PROGRAM DURING EACH SESSION. OUTCOMES INCLUDING STANDARD RANGE OF MOTION MEASURES, THE VANCOUVER SCAR SCALE (VSS), AND THE NECK DISABILITY INDEX (NDI), WHICH WERE RECORDED EVERY 10 SESSIONS. CFUS OF CERVICAL EXTENSION AND SHOULDER FLEXION WERE ANALYZED VIA PHOTOGRAPHS COMPARING CUTANEOUS POSITION DURING SPECIFIED YOGA POSES AND RESTING ANATOMICAL POSITION IN STANDING. OVER 30 VISITS, CERVICAL AND SHOULDER RANGE OF MOTION INCREASED, ALTHOUGH THE VSS AND NDI DID NOT SHOW SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. YOGA POSES SHOWED OVERALL CUTANEOUS RECRUITMENT DISTAL TO THE TARGETED JOINTS, AND BURNED SKIN WAS RECRUITED SIMILARLY TO NONBURNED SKIN IN POSITIONS OF STRETCH. INCORPORATING MULTIJOINT APPROACHES FOR STRETCHING, LIKE YOGA, APPEARS TO CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVED CLINICAL RANGE-OF-MOTION OUTCOMES WHEN PAIRED WITH TRADITIONAL BURN-REHABILITATION INTERVENTIONS. YOGA POSES INVOLVING MULTIPLE JOINTS ALIGN WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF CFUS, WARRANTING CONTINUED INVESTIGATION.	2022

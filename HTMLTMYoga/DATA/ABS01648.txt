1 1648 87 MOVING OUT OF YOUR MIND AND INTO YOUR BODY: YOGA BUFFERS THE EFFECTS OF CHILDHOOD MALTREATMENT ON PTSD SYMPTOMS. OBJECTIVE: CHILDHOOD MALTREATMENT HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY LINKED TO POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) SYMPTOMS AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS AND YOGA MAY BUFFER THE EFFECTS. THE CURRENT STUDY EXAMINED THE FREQUENCY OF COLLEGE STUDENT'S YOGA PRACTICE OVER THE PAST YEAR AS A MODERATOR OF CHILDHOOD MALTREATMENT AND PTSD SYMPTOMS IN THE PAST 30 DAYS. PARTICIPANTS: A SAMPLE OF 177 COLLEGE STUDENTS FROM A SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS COMPETED AN ONLINE SURVEY IN EXCHANGE FOR EXTRA CREDIT OR ENTRY INTO A GIFT CARD RAFFLE. RESULTS: MODERATION ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT A MORE FREQUENT YOGA PRACTICE BUFFERED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MALTREATMENT AND PTSD SYMPTOMS. CONCLUSION: CLINICIANS WORKING WITH COLLEGE STUDENTS WITH A HISTORY OF MALTREATMENT ARE ENCOURAGED TO MAKE REFERRALS TO YOGA CLASSES. UNIVERSITIES ARE ENCOURAGED TO ADOPT TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA PROGRAMS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
2 2890 23 YOGA: POTENTIAL BENEFITS FOR PERSONS WHO STUTTER. YOGA HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO MODULATE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM ACTIVITY, DECREASING ANXIETY AND STRESS, AND IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE. THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY SOUGHT TO EXAMINE THE USE OF YOGIC TECHNIQUES ON PERSONS WHO STUTTER GIVEN THE INTERACTION BETWEEN PHYSIOLOGICAL AROUSAL/ANXIETY AND STUTTERING THAT CURRENT MULTIFACTORIAL MODELS OF STUTTERING PROPOSE. FOUR PARTICIPANTS (M = 52 YR, SD = 10; 2 FEMALE, 2 MALE), RECRUITED FROM LOCAL STUTTERING SUPPORT GROUPS IN THE GREATER PHILADELPHIA COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERED TO PARTICIPATE. STUTTERING SEVERITY, ANXIETY, AND EXPERIENCES REGARDING STUTTERING AND COMMUNICATION WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE, POST INTERVENTION, AND AT 4 MONTHS FOLLOW-UP. THE PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED GROUP YOGA SESSIONS AND ENGAGED IN HOME PRACTICE. DESCRIPTIVE RESULTS REVEALED THAT PARTICIPANTS SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS ACROSS OUTCOME MEASURES, WITH THE MOST IMPROVEMENT RELATED TO ANXIETY. PARTICIPANTS ALSO REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR PERCEPTIONS ABOUT COMMUNICATION AS PER QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF RESPONSES TO THE OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONNAIRES. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR PERSONS WHO STUTTER AND WARRANTS FURTHER STUDY USING AN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
3 1629 17 MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA FOR YOUTH WITH PERSISTENT CONCUSSION: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: WE EXPLORED THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA (MBY) FOR YOUTH WITH PERSISTENT CONCUSSION BY EXAMINING OCCUPATION-BASED AND NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL OUTCOMES. METHOD: IN THIS CASE SERIES DESIGN STUDY, 6 YOUTHS AGES 13-17 YR WITH CONCUSSION SYMPTOMS FOR >4 WK PARTICIPATED IN AN 8-WK MBY INTERVENTION, 1X/WK FOR 45 MIN. PARTICIPATION, SELF-EFFICACY, AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY (24 HR) WERE COLLECTED BEFORE, AFTER, AND 3 MO AFTER THE INTERVENTION. HEART RATE VARIABILITY WAS ALSO MEASURED DURING EACH SESSION. RESULTS: TRENDS OF INCREASED SELF-EFFICACY IN ACADEMIC, SOCIAL, AND EMOTIONAL DOMAINS WERE FOUND AFTER MBY AND MAINTAINED AT 3-MO FOLLOW-UP. TRENDS OF INCREASING HEART RATE VARIABILITY WERE ALSO FOUND PRE- TO POSTINTERVENTION AND WITHIN THE EIGHT MBY SESSIONS. CONCLUSION: PRELIMINARY RESULTS REVEAL POSITIVE TRENDS AFTER A NOVEL, SAFE INTERVENTION FOR YOUTH WITH PERSISTENT CONCUSSION SYMPTOMS AND THE VALUE OF EXPLORING BOTH OCCUPATION-BASED AND NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES. FUTURE RESEARCH WITH A LARGER SAMPLE AND CONTROL GROUP IS WARRANTED.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
4  918 21 EFFECTIVENESS OF TRAINING PROGRAM COMBINING CHAKRAYOGA AND MEDITATION. BACKGROUND THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PROGRAM COMBINING CHAKRAYOGA AND MEDITATION ON THE PHYSICAL HEALTH AND DISEASE-RELATED FACTORS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS OF PEOPLE. METHODS NINETY-SEVEN SUBJECTS (32-83 YEARS OLD) WHO HAD FREE FROM PRIOR EXPERIENCES IN MEDITATION PROGRAMS OR CHAKRAYOGA TRAINING COURSES WERE ASSIGNED TO EITHER THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (EXP) (45 SUBJECTS; 13 MALE SUBJECTS AND 32 FEMALE SUBJECTS; AVERAGE AGE OF 60.67 YEARS, SD=11.09 YEARS) OR THE CONTROL GROUP (CONT) OF REMAINING SUBJECTS (52 SUBJECTS; 14 MALE SUBJECTS AND 38 FEMALE SUBJECTS; AVERAGE AGE OF 61.58 YEARS, SD=9.70 YEARS). SUBJECTS IN THE EXP PARTICIPATED IN THE CHAKRAYOGA MEDITATION PROGRAM FOR TWICE A WEEK FOR 2 H DURING 6 WEEKS IN EACH SESSION CONSISTED OF 1 H OF CHAKRAYOGA AND 1 H OF MEDITATION. THE MEASUREMENTS IN THIS STUDY INCLUDED THE MINDFULNESS, STRESS RESPONSE, SUBJECTIVE QUALITY OF LIFE, MEDICAL SYMPTOM CHECKLIST, DIFFICULTY IN EMOTIONAL REGULATION AND OBJECTIVE OF LIFE AND SENSE OF CONTROL. RESULTS RESULTS REVEALED THAT PARTICIPANTS IN THE EXP REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE RELIEF OF MINDFULNESS, STRESS RESPONSE, SUBJECTIVE QUALITY OF LIFE AND MEDICAL SYMPTOM CHECKLIST THAN THOSE IN THE CONT. CONCLUSIONS THESE FINDINGS PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT THE CHAKRAYOGA MEDITATION PROGRAM CAN HELP RELIEVE THE PHYSICAL HEALTH AND DISEASE-RELATED FACTORS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
5 2167 21 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN HELPING CANCER PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS MANAGE THE STRESS OF A NATURAL DISASTER: A BRIEF REPORT ON HURRICANE HARVEY. BACKGROUND: THIS SMALL QUALITATIVE STUDY REPORTS ON THE EXPERIENCES OF PATIENTS AND FAMILY CAREGIVERS WHO PARTICIPATED IN A DYADIC YOGA PILOT TRIAL WHILE UNDERGOING CANCER TREATMENT IN THE MIDST OF HURRICANE HARVEY. OUR PRIMARY PURPOSE WAS TO DETERMINE IF PARTICIPANTS IMPLEMENTED COMPONENTS OF THE PROGRAM TO COPE WITH THE STRESSORS ASSOCIATED WITH HURRICANE HARVEY AND IF THEY PERCEIVED BENEFITS FROM THE YOGA PRACTICES. METHODS: WE ADMINISTERED BRIEF SEMISTRUCTURED INTERVIEWS TO THE DYADS PARTICIPATING IN A DYADIC YOGA PILOT TRIAL. PARTICIPANTS (N = 5 DYADS) WERE ASKED TO DISCUSS THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH HURRICANE HARVEY, INCLUDING FACTORS THAT HELPED THEM COPE WITH THE EVENT WHILE RECEIVING TREATMENT. RESULT: PATIENTS HAD A MEAN AGE OF 55.6 YEARS, WERE MOSTLY NON-HISPANIC WHITE, MALE, AND HAD ADVANCE STAGE HEAD AND NECK CANCER. CAREGIVERS HAD A MEAN AGE OF 58 YEARS AND WERE MAINLY NON-HISPANIC WHITE AND FEMALE. ANALYSES OF THE INTERVIEWS REVEALED 2 OVERARCHING THEMES: (1) THE STORM'S NEGATIVE IMPACT AND (2) THE USE OF YOGA TO COPE WITH THE HURRICANE-RELATED STRESSORS. CONCLUSIONS: PATIENT-CAREGIVER DYADS EXPERIENCED PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS DURING THE STORM AND/OR ITS AFTERMATH. DYADS USED YOGA TECHNIQUES TO COPE WITH THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESSORS. YOGA SERVED AS A MEANS OF SOCIAL SUPPORT AS DYADS EITHER PARTICIPATED IN THESE ACTIVITIES TOGETHER OR WITH OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
6 1802 24 PREVALENCE AND PREDICTORS OF YOGIC BREATHING AND MEDITATION USE - A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SURVEY OF US ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS. INTRODUCTION: YOGA PRACTICE IN COMMON USAGE IS OFTEN CONFINED TO THE PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF THE COMPREHENSIVE PRACTICE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE USE OF TWO ADDITIONAL ASPECTS OF YOGA AS PART OF YOGA PRACTICE, I.E. YOGIC BREATHING AND MEDITATION (YOBAM). PREVALENCE AND PREDICTORS OF YOBAM USE AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS IN THE US GENERAL POPULATION WERE ANALYZED. METHOD: CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA FROM THE 2012 AND 2017 NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY (NHIS) (N = 61,267) WAS USED. 12-MONTH PREVALENCE OF YOGA USE AND YOBAM USE AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS WERE ANALYZED DESCRIPTIVELY FOR THE TWO COHORTS RESPECTIVELY. LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSES WERE USED TO ANALYZE SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND HEALTH-RELATED PREDICTORS OF YOBAM USE AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS. RESULTS: 12-MONTH PREVALENCE OF YOGA USE AND YOBAM USE WERE 8.9 % AND 4.8 % RESPECTIVELY IN 2012. IN 2017, 13.3 % HAD PRACTICED YOGA IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS AND 7.0 % HAD USED YOBAM. YOGA PRACTITIONERS AGED BETWEEN 50 AND 64 COMPARED TO BEING 29 OR YOUNGER, FEMALES, HISPANICS AND THOSE EXPERIENCING MILD TO SEVERE FORMS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS WERE MORE LIKELY TO USE YOBAM AS PART OF THEIR YOGA PRACTICE. YOGA PRACTITIONERS LIVING IN THE MIDWEST OR IN A RELATIONSHIP WERE LESS LIKELY TO USE YOBAM. CONCLUSION: IN RECENT YEARS, THE NUMBER OF YOGA PRACTITIONERS IN THE US GENERAL POPULATION HAS CONSIDERABLY INCREASED AND YOBAM USE IS COMMON AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS. YOBAM USE SEEMS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH AGE, GENDER, ETHNICITY, REGION, MARITAL STATUS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS DIMENSIONS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
7  579 18 DESIGNING A YOGA INTERVENTION PROGRAM TO IMPROVE WELL-BEING FOR PHYSICIAN TRAINEES: CHALLENGES AND LESSONS LEARNED. WELL-BEING ACTIVITIES MAY HELP TO COUNTERACT PHYSICIAN BURNOUT. YOGA IS KNOWN TO ENHANCE WELL-BEING, BUT THERE ARE FEW STUDIES OF YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR PHYSICIANS IN TRAINING. THIS PROSPECTIVE METHODOLOGY-DEVELOPMENT STUDY AIMED TO EXPLORE HOW TO ESTABLISH A YOGA-BASED WELL-BEING INTERVENTION FOR PHYSICIAN TRAINEES IN A LARGE URBAN TRAINING HOSPITAL. WE AIMED TO IDENTIFY FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO TRAINEE PARTICIPATION AND EXPLORE AN INSTRUMENT TO MEASURE CHANGES IN SELF-REPORTED WELL-BEING AFTER YOGA. COHORTS INCLUDED A REQUIRED-ATTENDANCE GROUP, A VOLUNTARY-ATTENDANCE GROUP, AND AN UNASSIGNED WALK-IN YOGA GROUP. WEEKLY 1-HOUR YOGA SESSIONS WERE LED BY A QUALIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTOR FOR 4 WEEKS. THE SEVEN-QUESTION RESIDENT PHYSICIAN WELL-BEING INDEX (RPWBI) WAS USED TO MEASURE RESIDENT WELL-BEING BEFORE YOGA, AFTER 4 WEEKS OF YOGA, AND 6 MONTHS POST-YOGA. TRAINEES ATTENDING EACH SESSION RANGED FROM 17 FOR REQUIRED YOGA TO 0-2 FOR VOLUNTARY YOGA, 2-9 FOR LUNCHTIME WALK-IN YOGA, AND 1-7 FOR EVENING WALK-IN YOGA. IN THE REQUIRED-YOGA GROUP (N = 17), OVERALL RPWBI MEAN SCORES DID NOT CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY ACROSS THE THREE QUERY TIMES, AND PARTICIPATION IN THE SURVEY DECLINED OVER TIME. THE MEAN BASELINE RPWBI SCORE FOR THE REQUIRED GROUP BEFORE YOGA WAS IN THE NON-DISTRESSED RANGE AND ANSWERS TO THE SEVEN INDIVIDUAL QUESTIONS VARIED. REQUIRING A YOGA ACTIVITY FOR MEDICAL TRAINEES MAY BE A GOOD STRATEGY FOR PROMOTING PARTICIPATION IN YOGA. THE RPWBI MAY HAVE LIMITED UTILITY FOR MEASURING CHANGES IN OVERALL GROUP WELL-BEING AFTER A YOGA INTERVENTION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
8  598 27 DEVELOPMENT AND PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES OF THE YOGA SELF-EFFICACY SCALE (YSES). BACKGROUND: YOGA IS A BEHAVIORAL PRACTICE THAT USES PHYSICAL MOVEMENT, BREATHING, AND MEDITATION TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND PROMOTE PERSONAL TRANSFORMATION. ANCIENT YOGA PHILOSOPHY PROPOSED THAT AN INDIVIDUAL'S CONFIDENCE ABOUT YOGA, A CONCEPT SIMILAR TO SELF-EFFICACY, WILL AFFECT THE LIKELIHOOD OF IMPROVED HEALTH FROM YOGA PRACTICE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DEVELOP AND EXAMINE THE PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES OF A SELF-EFFICACY MEASURE FOR YOGA PRACTICE (THE YOGA SELF-EFFICACY SCALE; YSES). METHODS: YOGA PRACTITIONERS WERE RECRUITED TO EVALUATE THE PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES OF YSES VIA A SECURE ONLINE SURVEY. WE COLLECTED DATA ON ADDITIONAL MEASURES TO FURTHER EXAMINE CONSTRUCT VALIDITY. AFTER TWO WEEKS, PARTICIPANTS WERE INVITED TO COMPLETE YSES ITEMS AGAIN TO ASSESS TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY. RESULTS: A MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS (N = 309) WERE WHITE (85%), FEMALE (82%), AND YOGA INSTRUCTORS (56%). THE 12-ITEM YSES IS UNIDIMENSIONAL WITH A CRONBACH'S ALPHA OF 0.93. TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY IS R = 0.79 (N = 170). YSES SCORES ARE POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH HEALTH COMPETENCE, HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, AND YEARS PRACTICING YOGA, SUPPORTING CONSTRUCT VALIDITY. ALSO, YOGA TEACHERS SCORED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ON THE YSES THAN NON-TEACHERS (P < 0.001). NON-SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS WITH EDUCATION, INCOME AND SEX SUPPORTED DISCRIMINANT VALIDITY. YSES MAINTAINED INTERNAL CONSISTENCY AND CONSTRUCT VALIDITY FOR ALL YOGA STYLES SURVEYED. CONCLUSION: YSES IS A RELIABLE AND VALID MEASURE OF SELF-EFFICACY FOR YOGA PRACTICE THAT MAY PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO BARRIERS TO ADOPTING AND MAINTAINING YOGA AS A HEALTH BEHAVIOR.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
9 1708 15 PEACEBUILDING THROUGH YOGA? QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF A YOGA PROGRAM IN A SOCIAL HOUSING COMPLEX IN SANTA MARTA, COLOMBIA. THE GOAL OF THE STUDY WAS TO ASSESS PERCEIVED MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH BENEFITS OF A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR PEOPLE LIVING IN CIUDAD EQUIDAD, A SOCIAL HOUSING COMPLEX IN COLOMBIA. THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS VOLUNTARILY ENROLLED TO COMPLETE TWO YOGA SESSIONS PER WEEK, EACH LASTING 1.5 HOURS, DURING A 3-MONTH PERIOD. ADDITIONALLY, THEY PARTICIPATED IN BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION FOCUS GROUPS. THIS QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT WAS INTENDED TO IDENTIFY PERCEIVED CHANGES IN AGGRESSIVENESS, INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND STRESS AFTER PARTICIPATING IN THE YOGA SESSIONS. DATA ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT PARTICIPANTS PERCEIVED CHANGES OVER TIME IN RELATION TO WHEN THEY BEGAN THE INTERVENTION.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
10 1657 25 MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN AND INTEREST IN MEDITATION AND YOGA IN HOME HEALTH AIDES: EVIDENCE FROM THE HOME HEALTH OCCUPATIONS MUSCULOSKELETAL EXAMINATIONS (HHOME) STUDY. HOME HEALTHCARE AIDES (HHAS) ARE A GROWING U.S. WORKFORCE HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO WORKPLACE STRESSORS AND MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN. IN THE PRESENT STUDY WE: 1) EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATION OF MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN TO LIFE SATISFACTION AND EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION; AND 2) CHARACTERIZE INTEREST IN MEDITATION AND YOGA IN A SAMPLE OF HHAS. A NONPROBABILISTIC SAMPLE OF HHAS EMPLOYED AT HOME HEALTHCARE AGENCIES IN FLORIDA, MASSACHUSETTS, AND OREGON (N = 285 TOTAL) COMPLETED A SELF-ADMINISTERED QUESTIONNAIRE WITH STANDARD SURVEY MEASURES ON MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN LOCATION, DURATION, AND SEVERITY; LIFE SATISFACTION; EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION; AND INTEREST IN MEDITATION TECHNIQUES AND YOGA. AMONG HHAS RESPONDING, 48.4% REPORTED PAIN IN THE LAST 7 DAYS AND 46.6% REPORTED PAIN IN THE LAST 3 MONTHS. HOME HEALTHCARE AIDES WHO REPORTED CURRENT PAIN AND CHRONIC PAIN HAD A SIGNIFICANT (P < .05) DECREASE IN SATISFACTION WITH LIFE SCORE AND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION SCORE. THE MAJORITY OF HHAS REPORTED AN INTEREST IN LEARNING ABOUT THE BENEFITS (65.6%) AND PRACTICE (66.4%) OF MEDITATION AND A WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN A YOGA CLASS (59.2%) OR STRESS MANAGEMENT MEETING (59.1%). THE HHAS REPORTED BOTH ACUTE AND CHRONIC MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN THAT WAS CORRELATED WITH LOWER LIFE SATISFACTION AND GREATER EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION. MORE EFFORTS ARE NEEDED TO REDUCE THE SOURCES OF INJURY AND EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
11 1009 25 EFFECTS OF MULTIMODAL MANDALA YOGA ON SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL SKILLS FOR YOUTH WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER: AN EXPLORATORY STUDY. CONTEXT: YOUTH WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (ASD) DEMONSTRATES IMPAIRMENT IN THE ABILITY TO SOCIALLY AND EMOTIONALLY RELATE TO OTHERS THAT CAN LIMIT PARTICIPATION IN GROUPS, INTERACTION WITH PEERS, AND BUILDING SUCCESSFUL LIFE RELATIONSHIPS. AIMS: THE AIM OF THIS EXPLORATORY STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF A NOVEL MULTIMODAL MANDALA YOGA PROGRAM ON SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL SKILLS FOR YOUTH WITH ASD. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: FIVE MALES WITH ASD ATTENDED 1 H YOGA SESSIONS, TWICE A WEEK FOR 4 WEEKS. MULTIMODAL MANDALA YOGA COMPRISED 26 CIRCULAR PARTNER/GROUP POSES, COLOR AND TRACING SHEETS, RHYTHMIC CHANTING, YOGA CARDS, AND GAMES. TREATMENT AND RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR ASD SOCIAL SKILLS ASSESSMENT (TSSA) SCORES WERE COLLECTED BEFORE AND AFTER THE EIGHT YOGA SESSIONS. THE MODIFIED FACIAL MOOD SCALE (MFMS) WAS USED TO OBSERVE MOOD CHANGES BEFORE AND AFTER EACH YOGA CLASS. PAIRED SAMPLE T-TESTS WERE CONDUCTED ON TSSA AND MFMS SCORES TO COMPARE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL DIFFERENCES POST THE 4-WEEK CAMP. NARRATIVE FIELD NOTES WERE DOCUMENTED AFTER EACH OF THE EIGHT YOGA SESSIONS. RESULTS: A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT FROM PRE- TO POST-TEST WAS FOUND IN OVERALL TSSA (T(4) = -5.744, P = 0.005) AND ON RESPONDENT TO INITIATION (T(4) = -3.726, P = 0.020), INITIATING INTERACTION (T(4) = -8.5, P = 0.039), AND AFFECTIVE UNDERSTANDING AND PERSPECTIVE TAKING SUBSCALES (T(4) = -5.171 P = 0.007). YOUTH'S MFMS SCORES INCREASED FROM 80% TO 100% AT THE END OF EIGHT YOGA SESSIONS DEMONSTRATING A PLEASANT OR POSITIVE MOOD. THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF THE NARRATIVE NOTES IDENTIFIED THREE KEY FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE YOGA EXPERIENCE: (A) ENHANCED MOOD AND EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION, (B) INCREASED EMPATHY TOWARD OTHERS, AND (C) IMPROVED TEAMWORK SKILLS. CONCLUSION: THIS MULTIMODAL MANDALA YOGA TRAINING HAS IMPLICATION FOR DEVELOPING POSITIVE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL SKILLS FOR YOUTH WITH ASD.	2018	

12 2556 18 YOGA FOR CHILDREN. THERE IS AN INCREASING INTEREST IN THE USE OF YOGA FOR CHILDREN TO CALM THE MIND AND INCREASE HEALTH AND WELL BEING. DESPITE SCANT BUT INCREASING EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN CHILDREN, SPECIAL YOGA PROGRAMS WITHIN SCHOOLS ARE BEING DEVELOPED FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS. THIS INCREASING POPULARITY OF THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA MAY ENCOURAGE PARENTS TO CONSIDER YOGA FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND REQUEST REFERRALS OR CLARIFICATION OF THE PURPORTED EFFECTS. A DESCRIPTION OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL BASIS OF YOGA, THE BASIC COMPONENTS OF A YOGA PRACTICE, SAFETY CONCERNS, AND HOW TO LOCATE AND EVALUATE A YOGA PROGRAM FOR CHILDREN WILL BE ADDRESSED.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
13 1539 20 KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDE, AND PRACTICE OF YOGA IN MEDICAL STUDENTS: ASSESSMENT OF ANTHROPOMETRY AND LIFESTYLE FACTORS. MEDICAL STUDENTS OFTEN EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT STRESS DURING THEIR UNDERGRADUATE TRAINING. EVIDENCE HAS SHOWN SHORT-TERM YOGA TO BE EFFECTIVE IN DECREASING STRESS IN STUDENTS. THIS STUDY AIMED TO ASSESS KNOWLEDGE ABOUT, ATTITUDE TOWARD, AND PRACTICE OF (KAP) YOGA AMONG MEDICAL STUDENTS. A SECONDARY OBJECTIVE WAS TO ANALYZE THEIR DIETARY HABITS AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. PARTICIPANTS CONSISTED OF 224 MEDICAL STUDENTS AGED 18-23 YEARS IN PRE- AND PARACLINICAL GROUPS. A CLOSED-ENDED KAP QUESTIONNAIRE WAS USED TO COLLECT DATA. ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS WERE TAKEN. RESULTS SHOWED THAT PARACLINICAL STUDENTS (70.5%) FAVORABLY PERCEIVED THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF YOGA. NEARLY THREE-FOURTHS OF STUDY SUBJECTS HAD PREVIOUSLY PRACTICED YOGA; GREATER NUMBERS INTENDED TO PRACTICE YOGA IN THE FUTURE. ABOUT 95.5% OF THE PRECLINICAL STUDENTS WHO HAD DONE YOGA HAD DISCONTINUED THE PRACTICE. PERCEIVED BARRIERS TO THE PRACTICE OF YOGA WERE LACK OF TIME, INSUFFICIENT FACILITIES, LACK OF COMPANY, AND LACK OF INTEREST. CONSIDERATION OF THE UNDERGRADUATES' LIFESTYLE REVEALED THAT 50.4% OF PRECLINICAL STUDENTS DID NOT EXERCISE, AND THEY ROUTINELY CONSUMED MORE JUNK FOOD WITH FEWER SERVINGS OF FRESH FRUITS/SALADS. PRECLINICAL STUDENTS EXHIBITED HIGHER BMI AND WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE COMPARED TO PARACLINICAL STUDENTS. FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT KNOWLEDGE OF AND ATTITUDE REGARDING YOGA WERE GOOD AMONG MEDICAL UNDERGRADUATES.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
14 1214 16 EXPLORING THE BENEFIT OF YOGA PROGRAMS IN CARCERAL SETTINGS. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A PERSPECTIVE ON THE VALUE OF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS PROGRAMMING IN CARCERAL SETTINGS. THE AUTHORS EXPLORE THIS TOPIC THROUGH INTERVIEWS WITH TWO FORMERLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATED IN YOGA PROGRAMMING WHILE INCARCERATED AND WHO WENT ON TO BECOME YOGA INSTRUCTORS THEMSELVES. ALSO EXAMINED ARE THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA PROGRAMMING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED, FOR THOSE WORKING WITHIN CARCERAL SETTINGS, AND ON CARCERAL ENVIRONMENTS GENERALLY. WE SHARE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTING YOGA PROGRAMMING IN CARCERAL INSTITUTIONS AND DISCUSS POLICY IMPLICATIONS. THE STORIES OF BOTH INTERVIEWEES REFLECT THE VALUE AND POTENTIAL POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA PROGRAMMING WITHIN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SETTINGS AND SUGGEST THE NEED FOR SUSTAINED PROGRAMMING AND ONGOING EMPIRICAL EVALUATION.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
15 2349 23 USING THE MULTI-THEORY MODEL (MTM) OF HEALTH BEHAVIOR CHANGE TO EXPLAIN YOGA PRACTICE. BACKGROUND: DIVERSE GROUPS, INCLUDING COLLEGE STUDENTS, ARE BEING ENCOURAGED TO PRACTICE YOGA. RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT COLLEGE STUDENTS FAIL TO ATTAIN THE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE. OBJETIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO UTILIZE THE FOURTH-GENERATION, MULTI-THEORY MODEL (MTM) OF HEALTH BEHAVIOR CHANGE TO EXPLAIN CHANGE REGARDING YOGA PRACTICE OF ASANAS, SHAVA ASANA, PRANAYAMA, DHYANA, YAMA AND NIYAMA AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS. METHOD: THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY RELIED ON A QUOTA SAMPLE OF STUDENTS 18 YEARS AND OLDER ATTENDING JACKSON STATE UNIVERSITY, A HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGE IN JACKSON, MISSISSIPPI, UNITED STATES. MEASURES: A 36-ITEM FACE AND CONTENT VALID INSTRUMENT WAS USED TO COLLECT DATA. STEPWISE MULTIPLE REGRESSION WAS USED TO ANALYZE THE SURVEY DATA FOR IDENTIFYING THE BEST POSSIBLE PREDICTORS OF YOGA PRACTICE. A STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL OF 0.05 WAS SET A PRIORI. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 70 PARTICIPANTS, MEAN AGE 28.62 YEARS (SD, 6.11), PREDOMINATELY FEMALE (84%) AND BLACK (87%) COMPLETED THE SURVEY. THE INITIATION MODEL CONSTRUCTS- CHANGES IN THE PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT (BETA = 3.99, P = .002) AND BEHAVIORAL CONFIDENCE (BETA = 0.331, P = .008)-WERE SIGNIFICANT, EXPLAINING 40% OF THE VARIABILITY IN THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE. PRACTICE CHANGE WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (F1,65 =7.569; P = .0001; ADJUSTED R2 = 0.460) FOR THE MAINTENANCE MODEL, EXPLAINING 46% OF THE VARIABILITY. CONCLUSION: THE MTM MODEL OF HEALTH BEHAVIOR CHANGE IS EFFECTIVE FOR EXPLAINING THE INTENT TO INITIATE AND MAINTAIN YOGA BEHAVIOR AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
16 2748 27 YOGA PRACTICE IN ENGLAND 1997-2008: PREVALENCE, TEMPORAL TRENDS, AND CORRELATES OF PARTICIPATION. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS A HOLISTIC PRACTICE THAT MAY OFFER SEVERAL HEALTH BENEFITS. NO STUDY HAS EXAMINED THE PREVALENCE, TEMPORAL TRENDS, OR CORRELATES OF YOGA PRACTICE AT THE POPULATION LEVEL IN A EUROPEAN COUNTRY AND VERY FEW SUCH STUDIES EXIST WORLDWIDE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE PREVALENCE, TRENDS AND CORRELATES OF YOGA PRACTICE IN ENGLAND BETWEEN 1997 AND 2008. FINDINGS: ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED IN EARLY 2013 USING HEALTH SURVEY FOR ENGLAND DATA. INDEPENDENT COHORTS, REPRESENTATIVE OF ADULTS LIVING IN ENGLAND, WERE SURVEYED IN ANNUAL CYCLES IN 1997-1999, 2003-2004, AND 2006/2008. PREVALENCE OF YOGA PRACTICE (DEFINED AS ANY PRACTICE IN THE PAST FOUR WEEKS) WAS DETERMINED AT EACH TIME POINT AND MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION WAS USED TO EXAMINE TEMPORAL TRENDS (USING 1997-1999 AS REFERENCE TIME POINT) AND THE CORRELATES OF YOGA PRACTICE. THE PREVALENCE OF YOGA PRACTICE WAS 0.46% (95% CI: 0.39%-0.52%) IN 1997-1999, 0.94% (0.83%-1.06%) IN 2003-2004, AND 1.11% (0.95%-1.28%) IN 2006/2008. YOGA PARTICIPANTS IN ENGLAND WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE OLDER, FEMALE, DEGREE EDUCATED, OF NON-MANUAL SOCIAL CLASS, LOWER BMI, BETTER SELF-RATED GENERAL HEALTH, INACTIVE OCCUPATION, AND HIGHER MODERATE-TO-VIGOROUS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. ADJUSTED FOR AGE, SEX, SOCIAL CLASS, AND LONG STANDING ILLNESSES, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASING TREND OF YOGA PRACTICE FROM 1997 TO 2008 (2003/04 OR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.59-2.34; 2006/08 OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.77-2.71). CONCLUSIONS: YOGA PRACTICE HAS INCREASED IN POPULARITY, THOUGH THE ABSOLUTE RATES ARE STILL RELATIVELY LOW. FUTURE POPULATION STUDIES SHOULD MORE COMPREHENSIVELY EXAMINE THE CONTEXTS, SETTINGS, STYLES, CORRELATES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE.	2014

SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS (SLE) IS AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE ASSOCIATED WITH WIDESPREAD INFLAMMATION AND TISSUE DAMAGE. IT IS MORE COMMON AND SEVERE AMONG BLACKS, HISPANICS, AND ASIANS; WITH HIGHER INCIDENCE IN WOMEN. WHILE THE GOALS OF MEDICAL TREATMENT ARE TO PREVENT FLARES AND REDUCE ORGAN DAMAGE, UP TO 50% OF PATIENTS PERCEIVE THEIR HEALTH TO BE SUBOPTIMAL WITH UNADDRESSED NEEDS INCLUDING FATIGUE AND PAIN. RECENT SLE TREATMENT GUIDELINES FOCUS ON IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE. YOGA HAS SHOWN IMPROVEMENTS IN QUALITY-OF-LIFE AND FATIGUE IN VARIOUS DIAGNOSES. WHILE THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE THAT YOGA THERAPY MAY HELP OSTEOARTHRITIS AND RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS SYMPTOMS, THERE IS ONLY ONE REFERENCE IN THE LITERATURE RELATED TO SLE. METHODS/SETTING: AN ADJUNCT STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO EVALUATE ADAPTING THE YOGA AS SELF CARE FOR ARTHRITIS IN MINORITY COMMUNITIES STUDY FOR A BILINGUAL POPULATION LIVING WITH SLE IN THE WASHINGTON, DC AREA. INFORMANTS INCLUDED 7 PATIENTS ENROLLED ONTO THE STUDY, AND 3 YOGA INSTRUCTORS LIVING WITH SLE. QUALITATIVE METHODS INCLUDED JOURNALS AND SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS. RESULTS: ENROLLING PATIENTS CLARIFIED REVISIONS FOR INTAKE QUESTIONNAIRES, AND SYMPTOMS THAT MAY IMPACT CLASS PARTICIPATION. PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED INCREASED BALANCE, BODY AWARENESS, AND TOLERATED A FASTER-PACED YOGA CLASS WHEN COMPARED TO THOSE IN THE PARENT STUDY. YOGA INSTRUCTORS' RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDED MODIFYING YOGA BASED ON ENERGY LEVELS AND FREQUENT CHANGES IN PHYSICAL ABILITY. CONCLUSION: THIS PAPER SHARES PERSPECTIVES FROM VARIOUS INFORMANTS AND AFFIRMS THE FEASIBILITY OF PROGRESSING TO A LARGER STUDY. IT SUMMARIZES OUR FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS TOWARDS CREATING A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, AS THERE ARE CURRENTLY NONE IN THE LITERATURE.	2018	
                                                                                    
18 2898 24 [EFFECTS OF FITNESS TRAINING AND YOGA ON WELL-BEING STRESS, SOCIAL COMPETENCE AND BODY IMAGE]. OBJECTIVES: AIMS OF OUR STUDY WERE TO DESCRIBE AND COMPARE INFLUENCES FROM A PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PROGRAM AND A YOGA PROGRAM ON WELL-BEING, MOOD, STRESSCOPING, BODY-IMAGE AND SOCIAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTHY PEOPLE. METHODS: 18 PERSONS ATTENDING A GYM AND 21 TAKING PART IN A YOGA PROGRAM ANSWERED FOLLOWING QUESTIONNAIRES BEFORE ENTERING THE PROGRAM AND AFTER TAKING PART FOR 20 UNITS: BODY-IMAGE-QUESTIONNAIRE (25), SYMPTOM-CHECKLIST- 90R (8), COMPLAINT- LIST (31), ADJECTIVE MOOD-SCALE (32) AND A VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE FOR ASSESSING STRESS-LEVEL (10). RESULTS: STATISTICAL ANALYSES SHOW SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SOCIAL COMPETENCE IN BOTH TRAINING GROUPS; THE GYM-GROUP REPORT REDUCED SEXUAL DISCOMFORT, WHEREAS PEOPLE TAKING PART IN YOGA-GROUP SHOW A REDUCTION IN SOMATIZATION AND BODY-RELATED ANXIETY AS WELL AS AN IMPROVEMENT IN PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING. CONCLUSION: OUR FINDINGS SUPPORT THE EVIDENCE THAT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN GENERAL IMPROVES PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING, HOWEVER, GYM AND YOGA SEEM TO HAVE DIFFERENT PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACTS. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD FOCUS ON COMPARING THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY INTERVENTIONS IN PREVENTION PROGRAMMES AS WELL AS EXERCISE PRESCRIPTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
19 2115 16 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH HAEMOPHILIA. THE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY HAEMOPHILIA LEAD TO IMPAIRMENTS OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH HAEMOPHILIA. THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH HAEMOPHILIA IN SHIRAZ, IRAN. THIS SEMI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WITH PRE- AND POST-TEST DESIGN WAS PERFORMED ON 27 BOYS BETWEEN 8 AND 16 YEARS OLD WHO SUFFERED FROM HAEMOPHILIA. THE PATIENTS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS. THE NUMBER OF BLEEDINGS, ABSENCES FROM SCHOOL, AND REFERRALS TO THE CLINIC WAS EVALUATED. THE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH INTERVIEWS AND USING THE PATIENTS' RECORDS IN THE HAEMOPHILIA CENTER. BESIDES, THE QUALITY OF LIFE WAS ASSESSED THROUGH THE HAEMO-QOL QUESTIONNAIRE. THEN, THE YOGA INTERVENTION WAS PERFORMED FOR 14 WEEKS AND THE DATA WERE COLLECTED IN THREE STAGES. THE COLLECTED DATA WERE ENTERED INTO THE SPSS STATISTICAL SOFTWARE, VERSION 18 AND WERE ANALYZED USING NON-PARAMETRIC FRIEDMAN TEST. AFTER THE INTERVENTION, SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED IN THE MEAN SCORES OF QUALITY OF LIFE DIMENSIONS AND THE NUMBER OF BLEEDINGS, SCHOOL ABSENCES, AND REFERRALS TO THE HAEMOPHILIA CLINIC (P<0.001). THUS, YOGA MAY IMPROVE THE HAEMOPHILIA CHILDREN'S AND ADOLESCENTS' PERCEPTION OF QUALITY OF LIFE WITHOUT THE RISK OF INJURY. THIS INTERVENTION ALSO SEEMED TO BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE NUMBER OF BLEEDINGS, REFERRALS TO THE HAEMOPHILIA CLINIC, AND ABSENCES FROM SCHOOL.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
20 2757 20 YOGA PRACTICES AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING OF STUDENT NURSES. YOGA HAS BEEN WITH US SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL, BUT IT IS ONLY DURING RECENT YEARS THAT IT HAS ASSUMED WORLDWIDE IMPORTANCE. THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE CT OF SELECTED YOGA PRACTICES ON PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING. IN THIS QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL ONE GROUP PRE-TEST AND POST- TEST STUDY, 83 UNDER GRADUATE STUDENT NURSES. WERE TAUGHT SELECTED YOGA EXERCISES. THE SE- LECTED YOGA EXERCISES WERE SYSTEMATIC RELAXATION, BREATHING, AND STRETCHING THAT WERE PER- FORMED IN THE FORMATIVE MANNER. THE' INTERVENTION WAS CARRIED OUT FOR THE MINIMAL DURATION OF ONE HOUR PER DAY, THREE DAYS A WEEK FOR A PERIOD OF 6 WEEKS. ASSESSMENT WAS- CARRIED OUT ON THE FIRST AND LAST- DAY OF THE INTERVENTION, USING-A MODIFIED HINDI VERSION OF POSITIVE AFFECT AND NEGATIVE AFFECT SCALE, (PANAS-H). IT,HAS 10 QUESTIONS EACH TO MEASURE POSITIVE (PA) AND NEGA- TIVE AFFECT (NA). SINCE THE DATA WAS TESTED AND FORMED A NORMAL DISTRIBUTION, THE PAIRED 'T' TEST WAS USED FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. THE. MEAN PA SCORE OF 42.92 AFTER YOGA PRACTICE WAS STATISTI- CALLY HIGHER THAN THE MEAN PA SCORE OF 32. 50 BEFORE YOGA PRACTICE (P=O. 01). THE MEAN NA SCORE OF 20.75 AFTER YOGA PRACTICE WAS LOWER THAN THE MEAN NA SCORE OF 23.33 BEFORE YOGA PRACTICE (P=0.427). THE YOGA PRACTICE CAN BE TAUGHT TO NORMALPARTICIPANTS AS IT MAY REDUCE NEGATIVE AFFECT AND INCREASE THE POSITIVE AFFECT WITHIN A FEW WEEKS.	2015

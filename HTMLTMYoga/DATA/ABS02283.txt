1 2283 202 THE USE OF INTEGRATIVE THERAPY BASED ON YOGA AND AYURVEDA IN THE TREATMENT OF A HIGH-RISK CASE OF COVID-19/SARS-COV-2 WITH MULTIPLE COMORBIDITIES: A CASE REPORT. BACKGROUND: WE REPORT A HIGH-RISK CASE OF A CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 19 (COVID-19)-POSITIVE PATIENT WITH COMORBIDITIES INCLUDING DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), HYPERTENSION (HTN), HYPOTHYROIDISM AND CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (CKD), TREATED SUCCESSFULLY USING AN INTEGRATIVE THERAPY PLAN BASED ON AYURVEDA AND YOGA, ALONG WITH GOVERNMENT-MANDATED COMPULSORY MODERN WESTERN MEDICINE (MWM) TREATMENT. RECENTLY, SOME EVIDENCE HAS BEEN EMERGING ON THE USE OF AYURVEDA FOR TREATMENT OF COVID-19. THE CLASSICAL TEXTS OF AYURVEDIC MEDICINE SUCH AS CHARAKA SAMHITA AND SUSHRUTA SAMHITA CONTAIN DESCRIPTIONS OF PANDEMICS OF SIMILAR PROPORTIONS AND DESCRIBE THEM AS JANAPADODDHVANSA, MEANING THE DESTRUCTION OF COMMUNITIES, ALONG WITH THEIR CAUSES AND TREATMENT. CASE PRESENTATION: THE CASE REPORTED HEREIN IS A 55-YEAR-OLD MAN FROM DELHI, INDIA, WITH CONFIRMED (TESTED) COVID-19, WHO FIRST TOOK MWM FOR 7 DAYS BEFORE SEEKING INTEGRATIVE THERAPY. THE PATIENT HAS COMORBIDITIES INCLUDING DM, HTN, HYPOTHYROIDISM AND CKD AND HAD DEVELOPED SYMPTOMS INCLUDING FEVER (WHICH WAS RESOLVED BY THE TIME INTEGRATIVE THERAPY WAS STARTED), SORE THROAT, DRY COUGH, BODY ACHES, WEAKNESS, BAD TASTE AND SMELL, AND HEAVINESS IN THE ABDOMEN. BASED ON THE PATIENT'S SYMPTOMS AND COMORBIDITIES, A TREATMENT PLAN INCLUDING AYURVEDIC MEDICINES, YOGA PROTOCOL, DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS AND LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS WAS PRESCRIBED BY A REGISTERED AYURVEDA DOCTOR AND A YOGA CONSULTANT. THE PATIENT STARTED EXPERIENCING IMPROVEMENT IN ALL THE SYMPTOMS WITHIN 2 DAYS AFTER STARTING THE TREATMENT; HE REPORTED APPROXIMATELY [FORMULA: SEE TEXT] RELIEF FROM THE SYMPTOMS AFTER 5 DAYS, AND ALMOST COMPLETE RELIEF WITHIN 9 DAYS. ALSO, THE BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS (BOTH FASTING BLOOD SUGAR [FBS] AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD SUGAR [PPBS]) EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT AFTER 5 DAYS, AND DECREASED TO WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE WITHIN 12 DAYS. BESIDES RELIEF IN SYMPTOMS, THE PATIENT'S REAL-TIME REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (RT-PCR) TEST DONE ON THE 19TH DAY RETURNED NEGATIVE RESULTS. CONCLUSIONS: INTEGRATIVE THERAPY WAS FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE IN MITIGATING THE SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19 IN THIS PATIENT WITH MULTIPLE COMORBIDITIES. MOREOVER, A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS (NOT UNDER CONTROL WITH MODERN MEDICINE) WAS ALSO ACHIEVED. INTEGRATIVE THERAPY BASED ON THE CLASSICAL TEXTS OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA MAY OFFER A PROMISING AND SCALABLE TREATMENT OPTION FOR COVID-19 PATIENTS. A CASE SERIES OR A SUITABLY DESIGNED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IS NEEDED TO ASSESS ITS EFFICACY.	2021	
                                                       
2 1644  43 MORBIDITY PROFILE OF PATIENTS SEEKING NATUROPATHY AND YOGA TREATMENT IN SOUTH INDIA: A DESCRIPTIVE STUDY. BACKGROUND YOGA AND NATUROPATHY (Y&N) IS ONE OF THE APPROVED COMPLEMENTARY AND TRADITIONAL SYSTEMS OF MEDICINE PRACTICED IN INDIA. UNLIKE OTHER SYSTEMS, IT IS A DRUGLESS SYSTEM AIMED TO OPTIMIZE AND FACILITATE THE INHERENT ABILITY OF THE HUMAN BODY TO HEAL ITSELF. THERE IS LACK OF LITERATURE ON THE TYPE OF PATIENTS SEEKING YOGA AND NATUROPATHY TREATMENTS IN INDIA. THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED WITH AN OBJECTIVE TO ASSESS THE MORBIDITY PROFILE OF THE IN-PATIENTS TREATED IN A NATUROPATHY AND YOGA HOSPITAL. METHODS DESCRIPTIVE STUDY DESIGN BASED ON CLINICAL CASE RECORDS. SIX HUNDRED AND FOUR CASES TREATED AS IN-PATIENTS BETWEEN APRIL 2017 AND JULY 2018 WAS ANALYZED. RESULTS THE AVERAGE AGE OF THE PATIENTS WAS 47.4 (SD +/- 16.1) YEARS, WITH 56% WERE FEMALES AND 44% MALES. ABOUT 50 DIFFERENT TYPES OF MORBIDITY RANGING FROM GENERAL REJUVENATION TO CHRONIC DISEASES HAD BEEN REPORTED. HIGHEST REPORTED DISEASES WERE CHRONIC IN NATURE, WITH HIGHER REPORTING FOR MULTIPLE SYSTEM MORBIDITY, FOLLOWED BY OBESITY, DIABETES MELLITUS, HYPERTENSION, ARTHRITIS, AND BACK PAIN. VARIATIONS WERE OBSERVED IN THE MORBIDITIES BASED ON AGE AND GENDER OF THE PATIENTS. THE MEDIAN DURATION OF TREATMENT WAS 8DAYS. CONCLUSIONS PATIENTS SEEK YOGA & NATUROPATHY CARE MAINLY FOR CHRONIC CONDITIONS, FURTHER OBSERVATIONS ON TREATMENT OUTCOMES, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND TREATMENT SEEKING BEHAVIOR CAN BE EXPLORED FOR THE EFFICACY AND FEASIBILITY OF YOGA & NATUROPATHY CARE IN MANAGING CHRONIC DISEASES.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
3 1915  38 ROLE OF NATUROPATHY AND YOGA TREATMENT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION. AIM: THE PRIMARY AIM WAS TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF NATUROPATHY AND YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN TREATMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE HYPERTENSION. DESIGN: THE VARIABLES OF INTEREST WERE MEASURED AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE INTERVENTION USING A PRE-POST DESIGN. SETTING: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED BY INYS MEDICAL RESEARCH SOCIETY IN JINDAL NATURE CURE INSTITUTE, BANGALORE. SUBJECTS: A TOTAL OF 104 SUBJECTS, ALREADY DIAGNOSED WITH MILD TO MODERATE HYPERTENSION AND ON TREATMENT WITH ANTIHYPERTENSIVE MEDICINES WERE INCLUDED IN STUDY. INTERVENTIONS: THE INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF VARIOUS INPATIENT ADMINISTRATION OF DIFFERENT NATUROPATHY TREATMENTS, YOGA THERAPIES, LOW CALORIE AND LOW SODIUM DIET FOR 21 DAYS. ANTIHYPERTENSIVE MEDICINES WERE WITHDRAWN FOR SOME PATIENTS IN ONE WEEK BASED UPON RESPONSE TO THE TREATMENT. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE OUTCOME MEASURES WERE VALUES OF DIASTOLIC AND SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND BODY WEIGHT. SUBJECTS WERE FOLLOWED FOR A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR AFTER EVERY 3 MONTHS. RESULTS: AFTER STARTING NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACH OF NATUROPATHY AND YOGA, SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE CAME DOWN FROM MEAN OF 139.6 TO 129.6 WHERE AS IT CAME DOWN FROM 91.2 TO 86.1 FOR DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE. AT THE SAME TIME FAVORABLE EFFECT WAS ALSO SEEN IN OTHER VARIABLES LIKE LIPID PROFILE AND BODY WEIGHT. AT THE END OF ONE YEAR OUT OF 57 PATIENTS WHO CAME FOR FOLLOW-UP, 14 CASES WERE FOUND TO HAVE BLOOD PRESSURE WITHIN NORMAL RANGES WITHOUT ANY MEDICATION OVER THE PREVIOUS 12 MONTHS. CONCLUSION: NATUROPATHY AND YOGA THERAPY CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A VALUABLE NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACH IN TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
4 2196  35 THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF YOGA IN MANAGING HYPERTENSION. HYPERTENSION IS A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM AND ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT CAUSES OF PREMATURE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. YOGA IS A TRADITIONAL INDIAN PRACTICE THAT HAS BEEN ADAPTED FOR USE IN COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE AND MAINLY INCLUDES PHYSICAL POSTURES, BREATHING TECHNIQUES, AND MEDITATION. THE IMPACT OF YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY INTERVENTION FOR HYPERTENSION HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED IN A NUMBER OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS; WITH AN OVERALL EFFECT OF ABOUT 10 MMHG REDUCTION IN SYSTOLIC AND ABOUT 8 MMHG REDUCTION IN DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE. YOGA SEEMS TO BE EFFECTIVE ONLY FOR HYPERTENSION BUT NOT FOR PREHYPERTENSION; AND ONLY AS AN ADJUNCT TO ANTIHYPERTENSIVE PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT BUT NOT AS AN ALTERNATIVE THERAPY. BREATHING AND MEDITATION RATHER THAN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY SEEM TO BE THE ACTIVE PART OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS. THESE PRACTICES CAN INCREASE PARASYMPATHIC ACTIVITY AND DECREASE SYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY, ARGUABLY MAINLY BY INCREASING GABA ACTIVITY; THUS COUNTERACTING EXCESS ACTIVITY OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM WHICH HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH HYPERTENSION. ALTHOUGH YOGA HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS IN SINGLE CASE REPORTS, POPULATION-BASED SURVEYS AS WELL AS CLINICAL TRIALS INDICATE THAT YOGA IS A RELATIVELY SAFE INTERVENTION THAT IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH MORE ADVERSE EVENTS THAN OTHER FORMS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. YOGA CAN THUS BE CONSIDERED A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR MANAGING HYPERTENSION. GIVEN THE POSSIBLY BETTER RISK/BENEFIT RATIO, IT MAY BE ADVISABLE TO FOCUS ON YOGIC MEDITATION AND/OR BREATHING TECHNIQUES.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
5  283  41 ADHERENCE TO YOGA AND ITS RESULTANT EFFECTS ON BLOOD GLUCOSE IN TYPE 2 DIABETES: A COMMUNITY-BASED FOLLOW-UP STUDY. AIM: TO STUDY THE ADHERENCE TO YOGA AND ITS EFFECTS ON BLOOD GLUCOSE PARAMETERS IN PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS. METHODS: A SINGLE GROUP LONGITUDINAL STUDY OVER 6 MONTHS WAS CONDUCTED AT VASK YOGA CENTRE, BANGALORE. FASTING BLOOD SUGAR, POST PRANDIAL BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS AND GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN AND QUALITATIVE IN-DEPTH INTERVIEW OF THE PARTICIPANTS AND THERAPIST WAS CONDUCTED AT BASELINE, END OF 3(RD) MONTH AND END OF 6 MONTHS; INTERMEDIATE OBSERVATIONS WAS CONDUCTED AT THE END OF EVERY MONTH. RESULTS: ADHERENCE TO YOGA IN THE COMMUNITY IN BANGALORE IS AROUND 50% OVER 6 MONTHS. PARTICIPANTS WHO COMPLETED THE YOGA PROGRAMME HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER HBA1C (END OF 3(RD) MONTH). AT THE END OF 6 MONTHS YOGA ADHERENCE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH FBS AND STRESS. FURTHER THERE WAS A TREND TOWARDS THOSE WHO DROPPED OUT HAVING HIGHER FBS, CONTROLLING FOR MEDICATION INTAKE, STRESS LEVELS AND DIET PATTERN (OR = 1.027, P = 0.07). QUALITATIVE DATA REVEALED THAT MOST OF THE PARTICIPANTS JOINED AND COMPLETED THE YOGA PROGRAMME TO HELP CURE THEIR DIABETES. PARTICIPANTS WHO DROPPED OUT FROM THE YOGA PROGRAMME GAVE REASONS OF TRAVEL, ILL-HEALTH AND INCREASED WORK-LOAD AT OFFICE. CONCLUSIONS: ADHERENCE TO YOGA HAS AN EFFECT ON THE BLOOD GLUCOSE PARAMETERS IN DIABETES. HENCE, STRATEGIES TO MOTIVATE PARTICIPANTS TO UNDERGO 'LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION PRACTICES' INCLUDING MAXIMIZING ADHERENCE TO YOGA SHOULD BE THE FOCUS TO EXPERIENCE ANY BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
6 1928  40 ROLE OF YOGA IN DIABETES. THE SCIENCE OF YOGA IS AN ANCIENT ONE. IT IS A RICH HERITAGE OF OUR CULTURE. SEVERAL OLDER BOOKS MAKE A MENTION OF THE USEFULNESS OF YOGA IN THE TREATMENT OF CERTAIN DISEASES AND PRESERVATION OF HEALTH IN NORMAL INDIVIDUALS. THE EFFECT OF YOGIC PRACTICES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES HAS NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED WELL. WE CARRIED OUT WELL DESIGNED STUDIES IN NORMAL INDIVIDUALS AND THOSE WITH DIABETES TO ASSESS THE ROLE OF YOGIC PRACTICES ON GLYCAEMIC CONTROL, INSULIN KINETICS, BODY COMPOSITION EXERCISE TOLERANCE AND VARIOUS CO-MORBIDITIES LIKE HYPERTENSION AND DYSLIPIDEMIA. THESE STUDIES WERE BOTH SHORT TERM AND LONG-TERM. THESE STUDIES HAVE CONFIRMED THE USEFUL ROLE OF YOGA IN THE CONTROL OF DIABETES MELLITUS. FASTING AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS CAME DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY. GOOD GLYCAEMIC STATUS CAN BE MAINTAINED FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME. THERE WAS A LOWERING OF DRUG REQUIREMENT AND THE INCIDENCE OF ACUTE COMPLICATIONS LIKE INFECTION AND KETOSIS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE INSULIN KINETICS AND THOSE OF COUNTER-REGULATORY HORMONES LIKE CORTISOL. THERE WAS A DECREASE IN FREE FATTY ACIDS. THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN LEAN BODY MASS AND DECREASE IN BODY FAT PERCENTAGE. THE NUMBER OF INSULIN RECEPTORS WAS ALSO INCREASED. THERE WAS AN IMPROVEMENT IN INSULIN SENSITIVITY AND DECLINE IN INSULIN RESISTANCE. ALL THESE SUGGEST THAT YOGIC PRACTICES HAVE A ROLE EVEN IN THE PREVENTION OF DIABETES. THERE IS A BENEFICIAL EFFECT ON THE CO-MORBID CONDITIONS LIKE HYPERTENSION AND DYSLIPIDEMIA.	2007

THIS STUDY WITH AIM OF DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF A YOGA PROGRAM FOR PATIENTS WITH T2DM WAS CARRIED IN VIEW OF EMERGING EVIDENCE OF YOGA AS AN ALTERNATIVE AND/OR COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT. CLASSICAL AND CONTEMPORARY YOGA TEXTS WERE REVIEWED FOR IDENTIFICATION OF YOGA PRACTICES. AFTER REVIEWING RESEARCH PAPERS AND YOGA TEXTS A THREE-STEP YOGA PROGRAM, IN ORDER OF INCREASING DIFFICULTY LEVEL FOR T2DM WAS PREPARED. FOR VALIDATION OF YOGA PROGRAM, MIXED METHODS APPROACH INTEGRATING QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE INPUTS WAS CONSIDERED. EIGHTEEN EXPERTS OVER THREE ROUNDS OF ITERATION CONTRIBUTED TOWARD VALIDATION OF YOGA PROGRAM. A FINAL SET OF THREE-STEP YOGA PROGRAM WAS OBTAINED WHICH FURTHER NEEDS TO BE TESTED IN STANDARDIZED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS.TRIAL REGISTRATION WITH INDIAN COUNCIL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH: CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY OF INDIA; ICMR-CTRI: DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION STUDY: CTRI/2013/11/004163.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
8  783  44 EFFECT OF YOGA BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION ON STATE AND TRAIT ANXIETY. CONSIDERABLE EVIDENCE EXISTS FOR THE PLACE OF MIND BODY MEDICINE IN THE TREATMENT OF ANXIETY DISORDERS. EXCESSIVE ANXIETY IS MALADAPTIVE. IT IS OFTEN CONSIDERED TO BE THE MAJOR COMPONENT OF UNHEALTHY LIFESTYLE THAT CONTRIBUTES SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE PATHOGENESIS OF NOT ONLY PSYCHIATRIC BUT ALSO MANY OTHER SYSTEMIC DISORDERS. AMONG THE APPROACHES TO REDUCE THE LEVEL OF ANXIETY HAS BEEN THE SEARCH FOR HEALTHY LIFESTYLES. THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO STUDY THE SHORT-TERM IMPACT OF A COMPREHENSIVE BUT BRIEF LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION, BASED ON YOGA, ON ANXIETY LEVELS IN NORMAL AND DISEASED SUBJECTS. THE STUDY WAS THE RESULT OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH CARRIED OUT IN THE INTEGRAL HEALTH CLINIC (IHC) AT THE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSIOLOGY OF ALL INDIA INSTITUTE OF MEDICAL SCIENCES. THE SUBJECTS HAD HISTORY OF HYPERTENSION, CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE, DIABETES MELLITUS, OBESITY, PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS (DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, 'STRESS'), GASTROINTESTINAL PROBLEMS (NON ULCER DYSPEPSIA, DUODENAL ULCERS, IRRITABLE BOWEL DISEASE, CROHN'S DISEASE, CHRONIC CONSTIPATION) AND THYROID DISORDERS (HYPERTHYROIDISM AND HYPOTHYROIDISM). THE INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF ASANAS, PRANAYAMA, RELAXATION TECHNIQUES, GROUP SUPPORT, INDIVIDUALIZED ADVICE, AND LECTURES AND FILMS ON PHILOSOPHY OF YOGA, THE PLACE OF YOGA IN DAILY LIFE, MEDITATION, STRESS MANAGEMENT, NUTRITION, AND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE ILLNESS. THE OUTCOME MEASURES WERE ANXIETY SCORES, TAKEN ON THE FIRST AND LAST DAY OF THE COURSE. ANXIETY SCORES, BOTH STATE AND TRAIT ANXIETY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED. AMONG THE DISEASED SUBJECTS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT WAS SEEN IN THE ANXIETY LEVELS OF PATIENTS OF HYPERTENSION, CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE, OBESITY, CERVICAL SPONDYLITIS AND THOSE WITH PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS. THE OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT A SHORT EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMME FOR LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AND STRESS MANAGEMENT LEADS TO REMARKABLE REDUCTION IN THE ANXIETY SCORES WITHIN A PERIOD OF 10 DAYS.	2006	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
9  103  39 A PILOT CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY ON AWARENESS AND PRACTICE REGARDING TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS AND ITS MANAGEMENT WITH YOGA. DIABETES MELLITUS IS A METABOLIC DISORDER OF MULTIPLE ETIOLOGY, CHARACTERIZED BY CHRONIC HYPERGLYCAEMIA WITH DISTURBANCE OF CARBOHYDRATE, FAT, AND PROTEIN METABOLISM RESULTING FROM DEFECT IN INSULIN SECRETION, INSULIN ACTION OR BOTH. IMPROPER LIFESTYLE CONTRIBUTES TO THE INCREASING NUMBER OF PEOPLE AFFECTED WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM). SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS ON THE MANAGEMENT OF T2DM IN ADULTS THROUGH YOGA REPORTED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN MULTIPLE MODIFIABLE INDICES OF DIABETES MELLITUS MANAGEMENT INCLUDING GLYCEMIC CONTROL, LIPID LEVELS, AND BODY COMPOSITION. AWARENESS LEVELS OF A CONDITION AMONG THE POPULATION PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN BEHAVIOUR CHANGE. HOWEVER, STUDIES RELATED TO ASSESSING THE AWARENESS AND PRACTICE OF YOGA FOR MANAGING DISEASES ARE LIMITED. HENCE, THIS STUDY WAS FORMULATED WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF ASSESSING THE AWARENESS LEVEL AND EXTENT OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT DIABETES MELLITUS AND ITS MANAGEMENT THROUGH YOGA. A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY WITH A SAMPLE SIZE OF 317 WAS CONDUCTED USING A STRUCTURED QUESTIONNAIRE AT 5 DISTRICTS IN TAMIL NADU AND KERALA. 95% OF THE STUDY POPULATION WERE AWARE OF DIABETES MELLITUS WHILE 61.2% RESPONDED THAT DIABETES CAN BE PREVENTED BY REGULAR EXERCISE AND HEALTHY DIET. 62.4% PEOPLE PERCEIVED THAT YOGA PRACTICES CAN PREVENT DIABETES MELLITUS AND 59% MENTIONED THAT REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE CAN HELP IN CONTROLLING DIABETES AND PREVENT FURTHER COMPLICATIONS. ONLY 13% REPORTED TO PRACTICE YOGA REGULARLY AT LEAST THREE DAYS A WEEK. IDENTIFYING A QUALIFIED YOGA TRAINER WAS REPORTED TO BE A LIMITING FACTOR FOR REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE. THE STUDY SUGGESTED THAT THERE IS A NEED TO INCREASE THE ACCESS TO QUALIFIED YOGA PROFESSIONALS AT COMMUNITY LEVEL. FURTHER LARGE SCALE STUDIES WITH RANDOM SAMPLING METHOD TO ASSESS THE AWARENESS LEVEL AND PRACTICE OF YOGA IN DIFFERENT SETTINGS IS INDICATED.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
10  876  54 EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY ON REACTION TIME, BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS AND WELLNESS SCORE OF PERI AND POST-MENOPAUSAL DIABETIC PATIENTS. BACKGROUND: YOGIC PRACTICES MAY AID IN THE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES MELLITUS (DM) AND REDUCE CARDIOVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS IN THE POPULATION. THE PRESENT STUDY HAS BEEN UNDERTAKEN TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY ON REACTION TIME, BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS AND WELLNESS SCORE OF PERI AND POST-MENOPAUSAL DIABETIC PATIENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 15 PERI AND POST-MENOPAUSAL PATIENTS RECEIVING STANDARD MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR TYPE 2 DM WERE RECRUITED AND REACTION TIME AND BIOCHEMICAL INVESTIGATIONS WERE DONE BEFORE AND AFTER A COMPREHENSIVE YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM COMPRISING OF THREE TIMES A WEEK SESSIONS FOR SIX WEEKS. A POST-INTERVENTION, RETROSPECTIVE WELLNESS QUESTIONNAIRE COMPILED BY ACYTER WAS USED TO EVALUATE THE COMPARATIVE FEELINGS OF THE PATIENTS AFTER THE THERAPY PROGRAM. RESULTS: YOGA TRAINING REDUCED AUDITORY REACTION TIME (ART) FROM RIGHT AS WELL AS LEFT HAND, THE DECREASE BEING STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P<0.05) FOR ART FROM THE RIGHT HAND. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT (P<0.01) DECREASE IN FASTING AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS AS WELL AS LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN. THE DECREASE IN TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDES, AND VERY LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN AND INCREASE IN HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN WAS ALSO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P<0.05). ALL THE LIPID RATIOS SHOWED DESIRABLE IMPROVEMENT WITH A DECREASE (P<0.01) OF TC/HDL AND LDL/HDL RATIOS AND INCREASE (P<0.05) IN THE HDL/LDL RATIO. DISCUSSION OR CONCLUSION: SHORTENING OF RT IMPLIES AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE INFORMATION PROCESSING AND REFLEXES AND IS THE FIRST SUCH REPORT IN DIABETIC PATIENTS. THIS HAS CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE AND IS WORTH FURTHER EXPLORATION WITH WIDER, WELL CONTROLLED, RANDOMIZED STUDIES IN THE DIABETIC POPULATION. CHANGES IN BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS MAY BE DUE TO IMPROVED INSULIN SENSITIVITY, DECLINE IN INSULIN RESISTANCE AND INCREASED SENSITIVITY OF THE PANCREATIC B CELLS TO GLUCOSE SIGNALS. YOGA IMPROVED THE 'HEART FRIENDLY' STATUS OF LIPID PROFILE IN OUR SUBJECTS AND AS OUR PARTICIPANTS WERE PERI AND POST-MENOPAUSAL, THE DECREASE IN CARDIOVASCULAR RISK PROFILE IS OF GREATER SIGNIFICANCE. A COMPREHENSIVE YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ENHANCE THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF STANDARD MEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES MELLITUS AND CAN BE USED AS AN EFFECTIVE COMPLEMENTARY OR INTEGRATIVE THERAPY PROGRAM.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
11  784  33 EFFECT OF YOGA BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION ON SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING. YOGA IS ASSUMING IMPORTANCE IN IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE TREATMENT OF A NUMBER OF PSYCHIATRIC AND PSYCHOSOMATIC DISORDERS. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS A PROSPECTIVE CONTROLLED STUDY TO EXPLORE THE SHORT-TERM IMPACT OF A COMPREHENSIVE BUT BRIEF LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION, BASED ON YOGA, ON SUBJECTIVE WELL BEING LEVELS IN NORMAL AND DISEASED SUBJECTS. NORMAL HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS AND SUBJECTS HAVING HYPERTENSION, CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE, DIABETES MELLITUS OR A VARIETY OF OTHER ILLNESSES WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. THE OUTCOME MEASURES WERE 'SUBJECTIVE WELL BEING INVENTORY' (SUBI) SCORES, TAKEN ON THE FIRST AND LAST DAY OF THE COURSE. THE INVENTORY CONSISTS OF QUESTIONS RELATED TO ONE'S FEELINGS AND ATTITUDE ABOUT VARIOUS AREAS OF LIFE, SUCH AS HAPPINESS, ACHIEVEMENT AND INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIP. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE SUBJECTIVE WELL BEING SCORES OF THE 77 SUBJECTS WITHIN A PERIOD OF 10 DAYS AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS. THESE OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT A SHORT LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AND STRESS MANAGEMENT EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM LEADS TO REMARKABLE IMPROVEMENT IN THE SUBJECTIVE WELL BEING SCORES OF THE SUBJECTS AND CAN THEREFORE MAKE AN APPRECIABLE CONTRIBUTION TO PRIMARY PREVENTION AS WELL AS MANAGEMENT OF LIFESTYLE DISEASES.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
12 1929  35 ROLE OF YOGA IN MANAGEMENT OF ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION. TWENTY FIVE PATIENTS OF ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION WERE STUDIED. OF THESE, 20 PATIENTS WERE NOT GIVEN ANY ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUG TREATMENT (GROUP A); OTHER 5 HAD TO BE PUT ON ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS BEFORE INCLUDING THEM IN THE STUDY (GROUP B). THESE PATIENTS WERE DEMONSTRATED "SHAVASANA" AND TRAINED TO PERFORM IT CORRECTLY. SHAVASANA THERAPY WAS CONTINUED FOR SIX MONTHS. THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT FALL IN BOTH MEAN SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC PRESSURE OF BOTH GROUPS. FURTHER, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DOSES OF ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS, BEING GIVEN TO PATIENTS OF GROUP B. IN 65% PATIENTS OF GROUP A, BLOOD PRESSURE COULD BE CONTROLLED WITH SHAVASANA ONLY AND NO DRUG WAS NEEDED IN THEM AT ALL. BLOOD PRESSURE ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY TO PRE-SHAVASANA LEVELS IN PATIENTS WHO LEFT PRACTISING YOGA. THUS, WITH USE OF YOGA (SHAVASANA) IN THERAPY OF HYPERTENSION, REQUIREMENT OF ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED AND IN SOME CASES MAY BE TOTALLY DISPENSED WITH AND IT MAY BE AN USEFUL ADJUNCT IN TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION.	1984	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
13  609  50 DEVELOPMENT OF A MODIFIED YOGA PROGRAM FOR PULMONARY HYPERTENSION: A CASE SERIES. BACKGROUND: PULMONARY HYPERTENSION (PH) IS A HEMODYNAMIC CONDITION IN WHICH THE PRESSURE IN THE BED OF THE PULMONARY ARTERIES IS ELEVATED. ALTHOUGH MEDICATIONS HAVE IMPROVED BOTH SYMPTOMS AND MORTALITY, PH REMAINS A DEBILITATING AND DEVASTATING DISEASE. LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF NONPHARMACOLOGIC APPROACHES, SUCH AS YOGA AND MEDITATIVE BREATHING, IN TREATMENT OF THE DISEASE. OBJECTIVE: GIVEN THE UNIQUE HEMODYNAMIC CONCERNS OF PH PATIENTS, THE RESEARCH TEAM INTENDED TO DESCRIBE THE DEVELOPMENT AND SUBSEQUENT INITIATION OF A THERAPEUTIC TREATMENT PLAN THAT USES MODIFIED YOGA AND TO EVALUATE ITS BENEFITS AND SAFETY. DESIGN: THIS STUDY WAS A CASE SERIES WITH 3 PH PATIENTS OF VARYING FUNCTIONAL ABILITIES. EACH PATIENT WAS PROVIDED WITH A DVD, ACCESS TO YOUTUBE VIDEO SEGMENTS, AND A DOWNLOAD OF THE YOGA FOR PH APPLICATION. THE PATIENTS WERE ASKED TO DOCUMENT THEIR USE OF THE HOME EXERCISE REGIMEN AND JOURNAL AROUND THEIR SUBJECTIVE OBSERVATIONS. THEY WERE ALSO ADMINISTERED THE HEALTH PROMOTING LIFESTYLE PROFILE II (HPLPII) AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE 8 WK. SETTING: THE STUDY TOOK PLACE IN A TERTIARY CARE, ACADEMIC HOSPITAL IN A LARGE URBAN SETTING. PARTICIPANTS: IN THIS CASE SERIES, 3 PATIENTS WITH GROUP 1 PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION, WITH VARYING FUNCTIONAL ABILITIES, ARE DESCRIBED. INTERVENTION: THREE DISCREET YOGA PROGRAMS WERE DESIGNED WITH MODIFICATIONS SPECIFIC TO PH PATIENTS: CHAIR YOGA, INTERMEDIATE YOGA WITH A CHAIR ASSIST, AND EXPERIENCED YOGA. PATIENTS WERE PROVIDED WITH A VIDEO, YOGA FOR PH, IN THE FORM OF A DVD, A VIDEO ON YOUTUBE, AND A DOWNLOADABLE APPLICATION AND WERE INSTRUCTED TO LOG ACTIVITY AND SUBJECTIVE MARKERS OF WELL-BEING. OUTCOME MEASURES: SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE EFFECTS ON CLINICAL, PHYSICAL FUNCTION, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES WERE MEASURED. SUBJECTIVE EFFECTS WERE IDENTIFIED THROUGH JOURNALING AS WELL AS THE SELF-ADMINISTERED QUESTIONNAIRE HPLPII. WHEN AVAILABLE, 6-MIN WALK DISTANCE (6MWD) TESTING AND OXYGEN SATURATION WERE ALSO USED. RESULTS: THE MODIFIED YOGA PROGRAM PROVED FEASIBLE, SAFE, AND EFFECTIVE IN THE 3 DESCRIBED CASES. PATIENTS DESCRIBED DECREASES IN ANXIETY AND JOINT PAIN, WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN HEALTH-PROMOTING BEHAVIORS AS MEASURED BY THE HPLPII. OVERALL MEAN SCORES FOR HEALTH-PROMOTING LIFESTYLE INCREASED IN EACH PATIENT, THOUGH DUE TO THE SMALL SAMPLE SIZE, STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE CANNOT BE MEASURED. NO PATIENT EXPERIENCED AN ADVERSE EVENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRACTICE. CONCLUSIONS: THE MODIFIED YOGA PROGRAM FOR PH PATIENTS CAN PROVIDE A STANDARDIZED, ACCESSIBLE STARTING POINT FOR FURTHER STUDY ON THE FEASIBILITY, EFFICACY, AND SAFETY OF SUCH A PROGRAM ON A LARGER SCALE.	2015	

14  582  37 DESIGNING AND VALIDATION OF A YOGA-BASED MODULE FOR OBESITY WITH METABOLIC COMORBIDITIES. OBJECTIVES: OBESITY IS A CONDITION OF INCREASED ADIPOSE TISSUE IN THE BODY, WHICH IS COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS COMORBIDITIES LIKE DIABETES, HYPERTENSION, ARTHRITIS, BACK PAIN, AND MANY OTHERS. YOGA MODULES HAVE BEEN DESIGNED AND VALIDATED FOR OBESITY; HOWEVER, WE COULDN'T FIND ANY SPECIFIC MODULE FOR METABOLIC SYNDROME, A CONDITION WHICH INCLUDES OBESITY, DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2 AND/OR HYPERTENSION TOGETHER. KEEPING THIS IN VIEW, OUR STUDY AIMED TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE A SPECIFIC GENERIC YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION MODULE FOR METABOLIC SYNDROME PATIENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A YOGA MODULE WAS DESIGNED BASED ON TRADITIONAL AND CONTEMPORARY YOGA LITERATURE AS WELL AS PUBLISHED STUDIES. WE DERIVED THE YOGA PRACTICES FOR THE MODULE, FROM THESE YOGA TEXTS AND RESEARCH EVIDENCE WERE ALREADY AVAILABLE. THE YOGA MODULE WAS SENT TO 40 YOGA EXPERTS FOR THEIR VALIDATION. RESULTS: TWENTY-TWO EXPERTS GAVE THEIR OPINION ON THE USEFULNESS OF A YOGA MODULE FOR PATIENTS WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME WITH SOME SUGGESTIONS. OF THESE EXPERTS, 73% WERE MALES, AND 27% WERE FEMALES. YOGA THERAPY PRACTICES WITH CONTENT VALIDITY RATIO (CVR) >0.08 WERE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL MODULE. IN TOTAL, 86% (31 OF 36 ITEMS) OF THE ITEMS IN THE INITIAL MODULE WERE RETAINED. CONCLUSION: A SPECIFIC YOGA-BASED MODULE FOR METABOLIC SYNDROME WAS DESIGNED AND VALIDATED BY EXPERTS. FURTHER STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM THE EFFICACY AND CLINICAL UTILITY OF THE MODULE.ADDITIONAL CLINICAL VALIDATION IS SUGGESTED.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
15 1370  44 IMPACT OF A STRUCTURED YOGA PROGRAM ON BLOOD PRESSURE REDUCTION AMONG HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS: STUDY PROTOCOL FOR A PRAGMATIC RANDOMIZED MULTICENTER TRIAL IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE SETTINGS IN NEPAL. BACKGROUND: HYPERTENSION CONTROL REMAINS A MAJOR GLOBAL CHALLENGE. THE BEHAVIORAL APPROACHES RECOMMENDED FOR BLOOD PRESSURE REDUCTION ARE STRESS REDUCTION, INCREASED EXERCISE AND HEALTHY DIETARY HABITS. SOME STUDY FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA HAS A BENEFICIAL EFFECT IN REDUCING BLOOD PRESSURE. HOWEVER, THE ROLE OF YOGA ON BLOOD PRESSURE HAS RECEIVED LITTLE ATTENTION IN EXISTING HEALTH CARE PRACTICES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THIS STUDY WILL BE CONDUCTED IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE FACILITIES IN NEPAL TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A PRAGMATIC YOGA INTERVENTION TO COMPLEMENT STANDARD PRACTICE IN FURTHER REDUCING BLOOD PRESSURE. METHODS: THIS WILL BE MULTICENTRIC, TWO ARMS, RANDOMIZED, NONBLINDED, PRAGMATIC TRIAL. IT WILL BE CONDUCTED IN SEVEN DISTRICT AYURVEDA HEALTH CENTERS (DAHCS) IN NEPAL BETWEEN JULY 2017 AND JUNE 2018. THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS WILL CONSIST OF HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS WITH OR WITHOUT ANTIHYPERTENSIVE MEDICATION ATTENDING TO THE OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENT (OPD). ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY PARTICIPANTS WILL BE RANDOMIZED TO TREATMENT OR CONTROL GROUPS BY USING A STRATIFIED BLOCK RANDOMIZATION. AT THE STUDY SITE, THE TREATMENT ARM PARTICIPANTS WILL RECEIVE AN INTERVENTION CONSISTING OF FIVE DAYS OF STRUCTURED YOGA TRAINING AND PRACTICE OF THE SAME PACKAGE AT HOME WITH A RECOMMENDATION OF FIVE DAYS A WEEK FOR THE FOLLOWING 90 DAYS. BOTH THE INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS WILL RECEIVE TWO HOURS OF HEALTH EDUCATION ON LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME OF THIS TRIAL WILL BE THE CHANGE IN SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND IT WILL BE ASSESSED AFTER 90 DAYS OF THE INTERVENTION. DISCUSSION: THIS STUDY WILL ESTABLISH THE EXTENT TO WHICH A YOGA INTERVENTION PACKAGE CAN HELP REDUCE BLOOD PRESSURE IN HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS. IF PROVEN EFFECTIVE, STUDY FINDINGS MAY BE USED TO RECOMMEND THE GOVERNING BODIES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS FOR THE INTEGRATION OF YOGA IN THE NATIONAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FOR THE TREATMENT AND CONTROL OF HYPERTENSION.

16 2923  24 [WHERE AND HOW DOES YOGA WORK? - A SCIENTIFIC OVERVIEW]. AS A TRADITIONAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEM, YOGA COMBINES PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, BREATHING TECHNIQUES AND MEDITATION. IT IS INCREASINGLY USED AS A PREVENTIVE OR THERAPEUTIC MEANS. YOGA HAS BEEN RESEARCHED IN HUNDREDS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. POSITIVE EFFECTS ARE ESPECIALLY FOUND FOR CHRONIC PAIN CONDITIONS, HYPERTENSION, DEPRESSION AND IN SUPPORTIVE CANCER CARE. WHILE THERE ARE CASE REPORTS OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA, THE RISK SEEMS TO BE EXTREMELY LOW AND COMPARABLE TO OTHER FORMS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. YOGA CAN THUS BE CONSIDERED AS A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE ADJUNCT THERAPY FOR A NUMBER OF CONDITIONS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
17  373  41 AYURVEDA AND YOGA IN CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES. AYURVEDA IS DERIVED FROM 2 SANSKRIT WORDS, NAMELY, "AYUS" AND "VEDA," MEANING LIFE AND KNOWLEDGE, RESPECTIVELY. IT LITERALLY MEANS SCIENCE OF LIFE. AYURVEDA, OF WHICH YOGA IS AN INTEGRAL PART, IS WIDELY PRACTICED IN INDIA AND IS GAINING ACCEPTANCE IN MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. IT IS A COMPREHENSIVE AND A HOLISTIC SYSTEM, THE FOCUS OF WHICH IS ON THE BODY, MIND, AND CONSCIOUSNESS. THE AYURVEDIC TREATMENT CONSISTS OF THE USE HERBAL PREPARATIONS, DIET, YOGA, MEDITATION, AND OTHER PRACTICES. BASED ON THE REVIEW OF AVAILABLE STUDIES, THE EVIDENCE IS NOT CONVINCING THAT ANY AYURVEDIC HERBAL TREATMENT IS EFFECTIVE IN THE TREATMENT OF HEART DISEASE OR HYPERTENSION. HOWEVER, THE USE OF CERTAIN SPICES AND HERBS SUCH AS GARLIC AND TURMERIC IN AN OVERALL HEALTHY DIET IS APPROPRIATE. MANY HERBS USED BY AYURVEDIC PRACTITIONERS SHOW PROMISE AND COULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR LARGER RANDOMIZED TRIALS. YOGA, AN INTEGRAL PART OF AYURVEDA, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE USEFUL TO PATIENTS WITH HEART DISEASE AND HYPERTENSION. YOGA REDUCES ANXIETY, PROMOTES WELL-BEING, AND IMPROVES QUALITY OF LIFE. ITS SAFETY PROFILE IS EXCELLENT. ITS USE AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPEUTIC REGIMEN UNDER MEDICAL SUPERVISION IS APPROPRIATE AND COULD BE WORTH CONSIDERING.	2005	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
18 1732  41 PERSPECTIVE OF PATIENTS REFERRED TO YOGA CENTER IN A TERTIARY NEUROPSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL: A CROSS-SECTIONAL RETROSPECTIVE STUDY. BACKGROUND: YOGA HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE OR COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY IN PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS DEPENDING ON THE TYPE AND SEVERITY OF THE DISORDERS. HOWEVER, DATA RELATED TO PERSPECTIVE ON YOGA SERVICES AND THE BENEFITS AND ADVERSE EFFECTS ATTRIBUTED TO YOGA BY PATIENTS WITH MAJOR PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS IS LACKING. AIM: THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO ASSESS FEEDBACK OF THE PATIENTS WHO ATTENDED YOGA SESSIONS AT A YOGA CENTER IN A TERTIARY NEUROPSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS WAS A CROSS-SECTIONAL RETROSPECTIVE STUDY USING A SPECIFIC QUESTIONNAIRE TO GET FEEDBACK FROM PATIENTS REFERRED TO THE NIMHANS INTEGRATED CENTER FOR YOGA, AT THE END OF THEIR YOGA TRAINING. RESULTS: TWO HUNDRED AND ONE PATIENTS' DATA WERE INCLUDED IN THIS RETROSPECTIVE STUDY. MOST OF THE PATIENTS WERE REFERRED BY THE DOCTORS. THE YOGA MODULE FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA WAS MOST COMMONLY UTILIZED, FOLLOWED BY DEPRESSION. ON AN AVERAGE, PATIENTS ATTENDED 13 SESSIONS. MOST OF THEM PRACTICED YOGA FOR 1-2 WEEKS AND HAD MISSED LESS THAN 2 SESSIONS. THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE PATIENTS REPORTED THAT PRACTICING YOGA HELPED THEM. SPEARMAN CORRELATION ANALYSIS REVEALED POSITIVE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN IMPROVEMENT ATTRIBUTED TO YOGA AND VARIABLES AFFECTING QUALITY OF YOGA SERVICES AT THE CENTER, INCLUDING THE QUALITY OF YOGA SESSIONS ATTENDED. OVERALL HEALTH AND SLEEP IMPROVEMENT ALSO POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH IMPROVEMENT ATTRIBUTED TO YOGA. A MINORITY OF PATIENTS REPORTED ADVERSE EFFECTS, ALTHOUGH THESE DID NOT LEAD TO DISCONTINUATION. CONCLUSION: IN THIS RETROSPECTIVE STUDY OF PATIENTS REFERRED TO A YOGA CENTER IN A TERTIARY PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY, THE MAJORITY OF PATIENTS WITH MAJOR MENTAL DISORDERS WERE ABLE TO PRACTICE YOGA UNDER SUPERVISION AND REPORTED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SYMPTOMS WITH MINIMAL ADVERSE EFFECTS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
19 1552  44 LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION IN BLOOD PRESSURE STUDY II (LIMBS): STUDY PROTOCOL OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL ASSESSING THE EFFICACY OF A 24 WEEK STRUCTURED YOGA PROGRAM VERSUS LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION ON BLOOD PRESSURE REDUCTION. HYPERTENSION IS A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE AFFECTING 68 MILLION ADULTS IN THE UNITED STATES. LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS INCLUDING COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES SUCH AS THE MOVEMENT BASED MIND BODY PRACTICE OF YOGA HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY POPULAR IN THE UNITED STATES AND HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED AS A POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE TO MEDICATION IN BLOOD PRESSURE REDUCTION. WE COMPLETED A PILOT STUDY IN 2009 WHICH SHOWED MEANINGFUL DECREASES IN 24-HOUR AMBULATORY BLOOD PRESSURE READINGS AFTER A 12 WEEK PERIOD OF YOGA PARTICIPATION. BASED ON DATA FROM OUR PILOT STUDY WE ARE NOW COMPLETING THE LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AND BLOOD PRESSURE STUDY (LIMBS II) WHICH IS A PHASE 2 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL DESIGNED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY AND ENHANCED LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION ON LOWERING BLOOD PRESSURE IN PRE-HYPERTENSIVE AND STAGE 1 HYPERTENSIVE SUBJECTS. USING 24-HOUR AMBULATORY BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORING, LIMBS II AIMS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS ON BLOOD PRESSURE REDUCTION IN SUBJECTS RANDOMIZED FOR 24 WEEKS TO ONE OF THE THREE FOLLOWING GROUPS: YOGA THERAPY VERSUS BLOOD PRESSURE EDUCATION PROGRAM (SODIUM RESTRICTION AND WALKING PROGRAM) VERSUS A COMBINATION PROGRAM THAT INVOLVES COMPONENTS OF BOTH GROUPS. LIMBS II WILL ALSO EXAMINE THE IMPACT THAT CHANGES IN BLOOD PRESSURE HAVE ON CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW. IF SUCCESSFUL, THE LIMBS STUDY WILL DETERMINE IF YOGA THERAPY COMBINED WITH ENHANCED LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION WILL RESULT IN CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL DECREASES IN BLOOD PRESSURE AND THUS CAN BE IMPLEMENTED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO DRUG THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH PREHYPERTENSION AND STAGE 1 HYPERTENSION.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
20  549  21 CONTEXTUALIZING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY ON DIABETES MANAGEMENT: A REVIEW OF THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A REVIEW OF LITERATURE BOTH TO IDENTIFY THE EFFECTS OF YOGA-BASED THERAPY ON THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS AND TO EXAMINE THE SOCIAL CONTEXT OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. FINDINGS FROM THE REVIEW INDICATE THAT YOGA HAS A POSITIVE SHORT-TERM EFFECT ON MULTIPLE DIABETES-RELATED OUTCOMES; HOWEVER, LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY ON DIABETES MANAGEMENT REMAIN UNCLEAR.

FURTHER RESEARCH IS NECESSARY TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THIS INFLUENCE.	2008

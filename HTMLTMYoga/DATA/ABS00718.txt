1  718 99 EFFECT OF INTEGRATIVE NATUROPATHY AND YOGA IN A PATIENT WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS ASSOCIATED WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES AND HYPERTENSION. A 54-YEAR OLD MARRIED WOMAN WAS DIAGNOSED WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS IN 2002, ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION IN 2008, TYPE-2 DIABETES IN 2011 AND GANGRENE OVER 2(ND) TOE OF RIGHT FOOT. SHE UNDERWENT CONVENTIONAL MANAGEMENT IN PRIVATE HOSPITALS. HER SYMPTOMS, BEGAN WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE PAIN ASSOCIATED WITH SWELLING, STIFFNESS (MORE IN THE MORNING) IN MULTIPLE JOINTS ESPECIALLY OVER SMALL JOINTS. IN JULY-2014 SHE VISITED OUR COLLEGE HOSPITAL WITH THE COMPLAINTS OF PAIN, MILD SWELLING AND STIFFNESS OVER MULTIPLE JOINTS ASSOCIATED WITH POOR QUALITY OF SLEEP (QOS) AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). SUBJECT RECEIVED INTEGRATIVE NATUROPATHY AND YOGA THERAPIES (INYT) WITH CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE DAILY FOR 10-DAYS. AFTER 10-DAYS, IMPROVEMENTS IN PAIN, BLOOD SUGAR, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, STRESS, QOS, QOL, BLOOD ANALYSIS WITH NORMAL BLOOD PRESSURE (BP) WAS OBSERVED. THIS SUGGESTS THAT INYT COULD BE CONSIDERED AS AN ADJUVANT TO CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE IN RA ASSOCIATED WITH TYPE-2 DIABETES AND ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION.	2017

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO FIND THE EFFECT OF YOGA AND NATUROPATHY (YN) IN A PATIENT WITH ACTIVE MODERATE PANCOLITIS. CASE PRESENTATION: AN 18-YEAR OLD UNMARRIED FEMALE DIAGNOSED WITH UC IN 2017. PATIENT'S SYMPTOMS BEGAN WITH ABDOMINAL PAIN, NAUSEA, VOMITING AND DIARRHEA WITH/WITHOUT BLOOD STAINS MORE THAN SEVEN TIMES A DAY, DAILY. THE SYMPTOMS REDUCED AFTER TAKING REGULAR CONVENTIONAL MEDICATION FOR A PERIOD OF ONE-YEAR. HOWEVER, IN FEBRUARY-2019, THE PATIENT VISITED OUR HOSPITAL WITH THE SAME COMPLAINTS AND RECEIVED 21-DAYS OF YN TREATMENTS. RESULTS SHOWED A BETTER REDUCTION IN THE ABDOMINAL PAIN, DISEASE ACTIVITY, STRESS AND DEPRESSION AND A BETTER IMPROVEMENT IN HEMOGLOBIN LEVELS, QUALITY OF SLEEP, AND QUALITY OF LIFE WITH NO ADVERSE EFFECTS. CONCLUSIONS: YN COULD BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE THERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF UC. HOWEVER, FURTHER STUDIES ARE REQUIRED TO WARRANT THIS EFFECT.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
4  371 15 AWARENESS AND PRACTICE OF AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA AMONG HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS IN ANAND CITY. BACKGROUND: AEROBIC EXERCISE IS HELPFUL IN REDUCING ELEVATED BLOOD PRESSURE (BP). IT WAS ALSO FOUND THAT YOGA IS USEFUL IN REDUCING RAISED BP. THUS, THEY BOTH CAN BE USED IN PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION. HENCE, THE STUDY AIMED TO OBSERVE BOTH AWARENESS AND PRACTICE OF AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA AMONG HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS IN ANAND CITY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL DESCRIPTIVE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED. A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS PREPARED CONTAINING 24 QUESTIONS ABOUT AWARENESS AND PRACTICE OF AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA AMONG HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS. THE QUESTIONS WERE EXPLAINED TO ALL THE PATIENTS, AND 200 PATIENTS WERE RECRUITED FROM ANAND CITY THROUGH CONVENIENCE SAMPLING. RESULTS: TWO-HUNDRED PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED IN THIS STUDY, OF WHICH 100% WERE AWARE OF HYPERTENSION. 67.68% WERE AWARE OF THE ROLE OF AEROBIC EXERCISE IN HYPERTENSION, OF WHICH 58.29% PRACTICED THEM. THE AWARENESS OF THE ROLE OF YOGA IN HYPERTENSION WAS NOTED IN 33.67% OF PATIENTS, OF WHICH ONLY 13.07% PRACTICED PRANAYAMA AND 9.50% PRACTICED ASANAS. CONCLUSION: THERE WAS A COMPLETE AWARENESS OF HYPERTENSION AMONG HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS. A LARGE NUMBER OF PATIENTS WERE AWARE OF THE ROLE OF AEROBIC EXERCISE IN HYPERTENSION, BUT ONLY FEW OF THE PATIENTS PRACTICED THEM. HOWEVER, THERE WAS LESS AWARENESS OF THE ROLE OF YOGA IN HYPERTENSION AND EVEN LESSER NUMBER PRACTICED THEM.	2019

6 1665 31 NATUROPATHY AND YOGA FOR IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE IN PEMPHIGUS VULGARIS AND MANAGING CO-MORBID TYPE 2 DIABETES: A CASE REPORT. A 57 YEARS OLD MALE PATIENT WAS ADMITTED TO AN INPATIENT NATUROPATHY AND YOGA (N&Y) HOSPITAL, DIAGNOSED WITH PEMPHIGUS VULGARIS (PV) FOR ONE YEAR AND CO-MORBID TYPE 2 DIABETES (T2DM) FOR 10 YEARS, ASSOCIATED WITH POOR QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). HE WAS ADMINISTERED N&Y THERAPIES FOR 10 DAYS, ALONG WITH CONVENTIONAL MEDICINES. THERE WAS IMPROVED QOL AND REDUCED DOSAGE OF INSULIN, ALONG WITH REDUCTION IN BODY WEIGHT. THESE CHANGES WERE SUSTAINED AND IMPROVED FURTHER DURING THE 60-DAY FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO IMPROVEMENT IN THE SKIN LESIONS, THE IMPROVEMENT IN QOL INDICATE A POSSIBLE ROLE OF N&Y IN MANAGEMENT OF PV AND T2DM. THIS CASE REPORT ALSO WARRANTS FURTHER STUDIES FOR N&Y IN THE MANAGEMENT OF DERMATOLOGICAL CONDITIONS AS WELL AS METABOLIC SYNDROME.	2020

8 2461 23 YOGA AS A NOVEL ADJUVANT THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH IDIOPATHIC INFLAMMATORY MYOPATHIES. CONTEXT: RECENT STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS WELL TOLERATED BY PATIENTS WITH IDIOPATHIC INFLAMMATORY MYOPATHIES (IIMS) AND CAN HAVE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS AS AN ADJUVANT THERAPY TO PHARMACOLOGIC AGENTS, ESPECIALLY IF STARTED EARLY. TO DATE, NO STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PATIENTS WITH IIMS. AIMS: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SELF-REPORTED DIFFICULTY IN PERFORMING ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING (ADL) AND MUSCLE STRENGTH IN PATIENTS WITH MILD-TO-MODERATE IIMS. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A LONGITUDINAL COHORT STUDY IN WHICH PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSESSED USING THE MYOSITIS ACTIVITIES PROFILE (MAP) AND MANUAL MUSCLE TESTING (MMT) BEFORE AND AFTER THE COMPLETION OF AN 8-WEEK INSTRUCTOR-GUIDED YOGA COURSE WAS PERFORMED. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: WILCOXON SIGNED-RANKED TEST WAS PERFORMED FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. RESULTS: THE AVERAGE POSTTREATMENT MAP SCORES OF SIX PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED AN INCREASE OF 2.51 POINTS, WHILE THE AVERAGE MMT SCORE OF FOUR PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED AN INCREASE OF 11 POINTS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY IS THE FIRST STUDY TO DATE TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA AS AN ADJUVANT COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH IIM. CONTINUED RESEARCH SHOULD BE DONE ON THE EFFECT OF YOGA AS AN ADJUVANT THERAPY, FOR IN ADDITION TO INCREASE IN MUSCLE STRENGTH AND ABILITY TO PERFORM ADL, YOGA MAY OFFER POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS IN MOOD, MENTAL HEALTH, AND SLEEP.	2021

THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO MEASURE THE EFFECTS OF A BI-WEEKLY RAJ YOGA PROGRAM ON RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA) DISEASE ACTIVITY. SUBJECTS WERE RECRUITED FROM AMONG RA PATIENTS IN DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES BY EMAIL INVITATIONS OF THE RA DATABASE. DEMOGRAPHIC DATA, DISEASE ACTIVITY INDICES, HEALTH ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRE (HAQ), AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) BY SF-36 WERE DOCUMENTED AT ENROLLMENT AND AFTER COMPLETION OF 12 SESSIONS OF RAJ YOGA. A TOTAL OF 47 PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED: 26 YOGA AND 21 CONTROLS. BASELINE DEMOGRAPHICS WERE SIMILAR IN BOTH GROUPS. PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT YOGA HAD STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN DAS28 AND HAQ, BUT NOT QOL. OUR PILOT STUDY OF 12 SESSIONS OF YOGA FOR RA WAS ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN RA DISEASE PARAMETERS. WE BELIEVE THAT A LONGER DURATION OF TREATMENT COULD RESULT IN MORE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
10 1571 19 MANAGEMENT OF MYOFASCIAL PAIN DYSFUNCTION SYNDROME WITH MEDITATION AND YOGA: HEALING THROUGH NATURAL THERAPY. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY WERE TO STUDY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RAJ-YOGA MEDITATION AND PRANAYAMA IN PATIENTS WITH MYOFASCIAL PAIN DYSFUNCTION SYNDROME (MPDS) AND COMPARED THE EFFECTS WITH ONGOING CONVENTIONAL NONINVASIVE TREATMENT MODALITIES. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE STUDY COMPRISED 30 PATIENTS DIVIDED EQUALLY (10 EACH) INTO 3 GROUP, I.E., CONTROL GROUP (CONVENTIONAL, NONINVASIVE TREATMENT), EXPERIMENTAL A GROUP (CONVENTIONAL, NONINVASIVE TREATMENT WITH RAJ-YOGA MEDITATION THERAPY AND PRANAYAMA), AND EXPERIMENTAL B GROUP (RAJ-YOGA MEDITATION THERAPY AND PRANAYAMA ONLY). PARAMETERS SUCH AS PAIN, MOUTH OPENING, MANDIBULAR DEVIATION, INFLAMMATION, SWELLING, CLICKING, OCCLUSION, AND PSYCHOLOGIC EVALUATION SUCH AS ANXIETY, STRESS, AND DEPRESSION WERE ASSESSED BEFORE THE START OF THE STUDY AND AT WEEKLY INTERVALS FOR 3 MONTHS. RESULTS: POSTTREATMENT PAIN AND INFLAMMATION IMPROVED BOTH IN THE CONTROL GROUP AND EXPERIMENTAL A GROUP, BUT STATISTICALLY IT IS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT IN THE EXPERIMENTAL A GROUP. FURTHERMORE, IT IS EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY AS WELL AS FOR A LONG PERIOD IN EXPERIMENTAL A GROUP. IMPROVEMENT IN MOUTH OPENING WAS STATISTICALLY HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT IN CONTROL GROUP BUT NOT IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS. POSTTREATMENT ANXIETY AND STRESS STATUS WAS IMPROVED WITH STATISTICALLY HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT RESULT IN THE EXPERIMENTAL A AND B. THE POSTTREATMENT DEPRESSION STATUS ALONG WITH MANDIBULAR DEVIATION, SWELLING, CLICKING, AND OCCLUSION HAS NOT IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY IN ANY OF THE GROUPS. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION: RAJ-YOGA MEDITATION AND PRANAYAMA IN COMBINATION WITH CONVENTIONAL, NONINVASIVE, TREATMENT MODALITIES SHOWED PROMISING RESULTS IN MPDS PATIENTS AS COMPARED TO EITHER MODALITIES ALONE.	2018	

11 1915 27 ROLE OF NATUROPATHY AND YOGA TREATMENT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION. AIM: THE PRIMARY AIM WAS TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF NATUROPATHY AND YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN TREATMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE HYPERTENSION. DESIGN: THE VARIABLES OF INTEREST WERE MEASURED AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE INTERVENTION USING A PRE-POST DESIGN. SETTING: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED BY INYS MEDICAL RESEARCH SOCIETY IN JINDAL NATURE CURE INSTITUTE, BANGALORE. SUBJECTS: A TOTAL OF 104 SUBJECTS, ALREADY DIAGNOSED WITH MILD TO MODERATE HYPERTENSION AND ON TREATMENT WITH ANTIHYPERTENSIVE MEDICINES WERE INCLUDED IN STUDY. INTERVENTIONS: THE INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF VARIOUS INPATIENT ADMINISTRATION OF DIFFERENT NATUROPATHY TREATMENTS, YOGA THERAPIES, LOW CALORIE AND LOW SODIUM DIET FOR 21 DAYS. ANTIHYPERTENSIVE MEDICINES WERE WITHDRAWN FOR SOME PATIENTS IN ONE WEEK BASED UPON RESPONSE TO THE TREATMENT. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE OUTCOME MEASURES WERE VALUES OF DIASTOLIC AND SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND BODY WEIGHT. SUBJECTS WERE FOLLOWED FOR A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR AFTER EVERY 3 MONTHS. RESULTS: AFTER STARTING NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACH OF NATUROPATHY AND YOGA, SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE CAME DOWN FROM MEAN OF 139.6 TO 129.6 WHERE AS IT CAME DOWN FROM 91.2 TO 86.1 FOR DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE. AT THE SAME TIME FAVORABLE EFFECT WAS ALSO SEEN IN OTHER VARIABLES LIKE LIPID PROFILE AND BODY WEIGHT. AT THE END OF ONE YEAR OUT OF 57 PATIENTS WHO CAME FOR FOLLOW-UP, 14 CASES WERE FOUND TO HAVE BLOOD PRESSURE WITHIN NORMAL RANGES WITHOUT ANY MEDICATION OVER THE PREVIOUS 12 MONTHS. CONCLUSION: NATUROPATHY AND YOGA THERAPY CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A VALUABLE NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACH IN TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                  
12 2501 26 YOGA AS THERAPY FOR NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS: A CASE REPORT OF THERAPEUTIC YOGA FOR ADRENOMYELONEUROPATHY. YOGA IS A PROMISING THERAPEUTIC MODALITY FOR NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES. THIS CASE STUDY PRESENTS A THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROTOCOL FOR ADRENOMYELONEUROPATHY (AMN) AND ITS EFFECT ON A PATIENT'S QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), AGILITY, BALANCE, AND PERIPHERAL DEXTERITY. A 61-Y-OLD MAN DIAGNOSED WITH AMN WHO WAS EXPERIENCING (1) PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY IN HIS LEGS AND FEET, (2) LOWER-BACK PAIN (LBP), AND (3) OSTEOARTHRITIS RECEIVED 60-MIN WEEKLY THERAPEUTIC YOGA SESSIONS FOR A 10-MO PERIOD. YOGA THERAPY INCLUDED HATHA YOGA ASANAS (POSES) AND PRANAYAMA (BREATHING EXERCISES). HATHA YOGA ASANAS WERE ALIGNED WITH 7 BERG BALANCE SCALE (BBS) INDICATORS TO MEASURE IMPROVEMENT IN BALANCE AND RANGE OF MOTION. THE 10-MO COURSE OF THERAPEUTIC YOGA RESULTED IN IMPROVED LBP; IMPROVED FLEXION OF THE PATIENT'S HIPS, KNEES, AND ANKLES; IMPROVED PROPULSION PHASE OF WALKING; AND IMPROVEMENT IN THE PATIENT'S ABILITY TO STAND AND BALANCE WITHOUT AN ASSISTIVE DEVICE. THE EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY ON THE PATIENT IN THIS CASE STUDY ALIGNS WITH CURRENT QOL IMPROVEMENTS NOTED IN CURRENT RESEARCH ON YOGA THERAPY FOR NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS. THE DESCRIBED CONCEPTS AND METHODS OF EMPLOYING THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROVIDE INSIGHTS FOR CLINICIANS INTO A MODALITY THAT IS LOW RISK AND LOW COST AND THAT CAN SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS WITH OTHER NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS, SUCH AS MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS), FIBROMYALGIA (FM), AND DISEASES OF THE PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. FURTHER STUDY IS WARRANTED TO HELP DETERMINE THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF YOGA THERAPY FOR THESE CONDITIONS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
13  271 26 ADD-ON EFFECT OF HOT SAND FOMENTATION TO YOGA ON PAIN, DISABILITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN CHRONIC NECK PAIN PATIENTS. BACKGROUND: NECK PAIN IS ONE OF THE COMMONEST COMPLAINTS AND AN IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM ACROSS THE GLOBE. YOGA HAS REPORTED TO BE USEFUL FOR NECK PAIN AND HOT SAND HAS REPORTED TO BE USEFUL FOR CHRONIC RHEUMATISM. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO EVALUATE THE ADD-ON EFFECT OF HOT SAND FOMENTATION (HSF) TO YOGA ON PAIN, DISABILITY, QUALITY OF SLEEP (QOS) AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) OF THE PATIENTS WITH NON-SPECIFIC NECK PAIN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 60 SUBJECTS WITH NON-SPECIFIC OR COMMON NECK PAIN WERE RECRUITED AND RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO EITHER STUDY GROUP OR CONTROL GROUP. BOTH THE GROUPS HAVE RECEIVED YOGA AND SESAME SEED OIL (SESAMUM INDICUM L.) APPLICATION. IN ADDITION TO YOGA AND SESAME SEED OIL, STUDY GROUP RECEIVED HSF FOR 15 MIN PER DAY FOR 5-DAYS. ASSESSMENTS WERE TAKEN PRIOR TO AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION. RESULTS: RESULTS OF THE STUDY SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE SCORES OF VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE FOR PAIN, NECK DISABILITY INDEX (NDI), THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI), AND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PHYSICAL FUNCTION, PHYSICAL HEALTH, EMOTIONAL PROBLEM, PAIN, AND GENERAL HEALTH BOTH IN STUDY AND CONTROL GROUPS. HOWEVER, REDUCTIONS IN PAIN AND NDI ALONG WITH IMPROVEMENT IN SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WERE BETTER IN THE STUDY GROUP AS COMPARED WITH CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT ADDITION OF HSF TO YOGA PROVIDES A BETTER REDUCTION IN PAIN AND DISABILITY ALONG WITH IMPROVEMENT IN THE SOCIAL FUNCTIONING OF THE PATIENTS WITH NON-SPECIFIC NECK PAIN THAN YOGA ALONE.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                      
14  532 14 COMPARISON OF THE EFFECT OF YOGA, ZUMBA AND AEROBICS IN CONTROLLING BLOOD PRESSURE IN THE INDIAN POPULATION. AIM: THIS STUDY AIMS AT COMPARING THE EFFECT OF YOGA, ZUMBA DANCE, AND AEROBIC EXERCISES IN CONTROLLING BLOOD PRESSURE AMONG THE INDIAN POPULATION WITHOUT USING HYPERTENSIVE DRUGS. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY IS DESIGNED TO ANALYZE THE EFFECT OF YOGA, ZUMBA, AND AEROBICS IN CONTROLLING BLOOD PRESSURE AMONG THE INDIAN POPULATION AND TO DETERMINE WHICH OF THE THREE IS BETTER TO TREAT HYPERTENSION WITHOUT USING HYPERTENSIVE DRUGS. BACKGROUND: HYPERTENSION IS A DISEASE WHICH IS NOWADAYS MOST COMMONLY SEEN AMONG CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS AND HAS BEEN FOUND THAT REGULAR EXERCISE TENDS TO REDUCE THE LEVELS OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE IN A VERY EFFECTIVE WAY AMONG WHICH THE EFFECTS OF AEROBICS EXERCISE ON REDUCING HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE IN HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS HAD BEEN MORE CONVINCING THAT REGULAR AEROBICS EXERCISE REDUCES THE BLOOD PRESSURE BY > 1.5 MMHG.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
15 1381 25 IMPACT OF NATUROPATHY, YOGA, AND DIETARY INTERVENTIONS AS ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF STAGE II AND III ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE COLON. INTRODUCTION: NATUROPATHY, YOGA AND DIETARY INTERVENTIONS ARE KNOWN TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN CANCER PATIENTS. WE AIM TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF NATUROPATHY INTERVENTIONS ALONG WITH ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT SURGERY FOR ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE COLON. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 116 ADULT PATIENTS WERE RANDOMISED IN TO ONE OF THE TWO GROUPS; THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP RECEIVED NATUROPATHY, YOGA AND DIETARY INTERVENTIONS AND THE CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED PSYCHO-SOCIAL COUNSELLING IN ADDITION TO STANDARD CHEMOTHERAPY. HAEMATOLOGICAL, BIOCHEMICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATIONS WERE PERFORMED AT SET INTERVALS DURING A TOTAL PERIOD OF EIGHTEEN MONTHS STARTING FROM THE FIRST CYCLE OF ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY. RESULTS: RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE OVERALL HEMOGLOBIN (P < 0.0001) AND CARCINOEMBRYONIC ANTIGEN (CEA) (P = 0.0038) LEVELS WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IN PATIENTS ON THE EXPERIMENTAL ARM. THE REST OF THE LABORATORY PARAMETERS, VIZ. TOTAL LEUKOCYTE COUNT, PLATELET COUNTS, AND SERUM CREATININE LEVELS, FOR OVERALL DATA WAS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IN BOTH THE GROUPS. PSYCHOLOGICAL ATTRIBUTES SUCH AS ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, SYMPTOM SEVERITY, AND FUNCTIONAL LIVING INDEX: CANCER (FLIC) WERE FOUND TO BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.0001) IN THE EXPERIMENTAL SUBJECTS AS COMPARED WITH THOSE IN THE CONTROL. ON THE WHOLE, MEN BENEFITED MORE THAN WOMEN FROM THE STUDY INTERVENTIONS. CONCLUSIONS: WE CONCLUDE THAT YOGA AND NATUROPATHY INTERVENTIONS IN ADDITION TO CHEMOTHERAPY SHOW IMPROVEMENT IN OVERALL FUNCTIONAL LIFE INDEX ALONG WITH IMPROVEMENT IN HAEMOGLOBIN IN PATIENTS WITH STAGES II AND III ADENOCARCINOMA OF COLON.	2020	
                                                                    
16 2173 15 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON DYSPNEA, SLEEP AND FATIGUE IN CHRONIC RESPIRATORY DISEASES. PURPOSE: THIS STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT TO FIND OUT THE EFFECTS OF YOGA APPLIED TO CHRONIC RESPIRATORY DISEASE PATIENTS ON DYSPNEA, SLEEP QUALITY AND FATIGUE. MATERIAL AND METHOD: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED BETWEEN MAY AND AUGUST 2020 AS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. 'PERSONAL INFORMATION FORM', 'RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS MONITORING FORM', 'COPD AND ASTHMA FATIGUE SCALE (CAFS), "ASTHMA AND COPD SLEEP IMPACT SCALE (CASIS)" AND MODIFIED MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL DYSPNEA SCALE (MMRC) WERE USED IN DATA COLLECTION. RESULTS: WHEN THE POST-TEST MEAN SCORES OF THE PATIENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUP WERE COMPARED, IT WAS FOUND THAT CAFS, CASIS AND MMRC MEAN SCORES OF THE PATIENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP DECREASED POSITIVELY COMPARED TO THE PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WAS FOUND TO BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: YOGA HAS BEEN FOUND TO REDUCE THE SEVERITY OF DYSPNEA AND FATIGUE AND IMPROVE SLEEP QUALITY IN CHRONIC RESPIRATORY DISEASES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
17 2410 20 YOGA AND HYPERTENSION: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION IS A CORNERSTONE OF HYPERTENSION (HPT) TREATMENT, YET MOST RECOMMENDATIONS CURRENTLY FOCUS ON DIET AND EXERCISE AND DO NOT CONSIDER STRESS REDUCTION STRATEGIES. YOGA IS A SPIRITUAL PATH THAT MAY REDUCE BLOOD PRESSURE (BP) THROUGH REDUCING STRESS, INCREASING PARASYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION, AND ALTERING BARORECEPTOR SENSITIVITY; HOWEVER, DESPITE REVIEWS ON YOGA AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, DIABETES, METABOLIC SYNDROME, AND ANXIETY THAT SUGGEST YOGA MAY REDUCE BP, NO COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW HAS YET FOCUSED ON YOGA AND HPT. A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF ALL PUBLISHED STUDIES ON YOGA AND HPT WAS PERFORMED REVEALING 39 COHORT STUDIES, 30 NONRANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIALS (NRCTS), 48 RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS), AND 3 CASE REPORTS WITH DURATIONS RANGING FROM 1 WK TO 4 Y AND INVOLVING A TOTAL OF 6693 SUBJECTS. MOST STUDIES REPORTED THAT YOGA EFFECTIVELY REDUCED BP IN BOTH NORMOTENSIVE AND HYPERTENSIVE POPULATIONS. THESE STUDIES SUGGEST THAT YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE ADJUNCT THERAPY FOR HPT AND WORTHY OF INCLUSION IN CLINICAL GUIDELINES, YET THE GREAT HETEROGENEITY OF YOGA PRACTICES AND THE VARIABLE QUALITY OF THE RESEARCH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO RECOMMEND ANY SPECIFIC YOGA PRACTICE FOR HPT. FUTURE RESEARCH NEEDS TO FOCUS ON HIGH QUALITY CLINICAL TRIALS ALONG WITH STUDIES ON THE MECHANISMS OF ACTION OF DIFFERENT YOGA PRACTICES.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
18 1833 16 PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLNESS, YOGA AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS AFFECTED BY SCHIZOPHRENIA SPECTRUM DISORDERS: A PILOT STUDY. SCHIZOPHRENIA IS A SERIOUS PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER CHARACTERIZED BY POSITIVE SYMPTOMS, NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS AND NEUROCOGNITIVE DEFICITS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ESTIMATE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN WELLNESS, YOGA AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS AFFECTED BY SCHIZOPHRENIA SPECTRUM DISORDERS.

THIS IS ABOUT A PATIENT WHO ENCOUNTERED A FAILED TKR DUE TO IMPROPER SELECTION AS PATIENT HAD BILATERAL OA HIP THAT WAS IGNORED IN THE INITIAL STAGES. TO OVERCOME THE PROBLEM SHE WAS ADVISED BILATERAL HIP REPLACEMENT WHICH WOULD LEAVE HER WITH FOUR REPLACEMENTS IN THE LOWER LIMB. SHE REFUSED SURGERY AND WAS TOLD THERE ARE NO ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS. THIS PATIENT UNDERWENT A 3 WEEK INTEGRATED COURSE OF IAYT AT OUR CENTER AND SHE MADE A REMARKABLE RECOVERY. IAYT IS A GOOD NON-SURGICAL TREATMENT THAT CAN BE AFFECTIVE BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER KNEE REPLACEMENT AND IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS THE FIRST CHOICE OF TREATMENT BEFORE SURGERY.	2014

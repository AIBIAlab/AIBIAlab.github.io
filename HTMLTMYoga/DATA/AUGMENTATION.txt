1  419 213 BREATHING-FOCUSED YOGA INTERVENTION ON RESPIRATORY DECLINE IN CHRONICALLY PESTICIDE-EXPOSED FARMERS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO PESTICIDES HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH LUNG AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION EXACERBATIONS. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WE TESTED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BREATHING FOCUSED YOGA INTERVENTION ON ALLEVIATION OF ADVERSE RESPIRATORY AND COGNITIVE EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH CHRONIC PESTICIDE EXPOSURE IN FARMERS. METHODS: WE UNDERTOOK A PARALLEL, TWO-ARMED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH BLINDED OUTCOME ASSESSORS ON A CHRONICALLY PESTICIDE-EXPOSED FARMING POPULATION. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT DISTRICT PANIPAT, STATE HARYANA LOCATED IN THE NORTHERN PART OF INDIA FROM NOVEMBER 2019 TO AUGUST 2020. A TOTAL OF 634 FARMERS WERE SCREENED, AND 140 FARMERS WERE RANDOMIZED TO BREATHING-FOCUSED YOGA INTERVENTION (BFY, N = 70) AND WAITLIST CONTROL ARMS (N = 65). BFY WAS DELIVERED WEEKLY IN 45-MIN GROUP SESSIONS OVER 12 WEEKS FOLLOWED BY HOME-BASED PRACTICE. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS THE CHANGE IN SPIROMETRY-BASED MARKERS OF PULMONARY FUNCTION FROM BASELINE EXPRESSED AS RAW VALUES, GLOBAL LUNG INITIATIVE (GLI) PERCENT PREDICTED (PP), AND GLI Z-SCORES AFTER 24 WEEKS OF INTERVENTION. SECONDARY VARIABLES WERE TRAIL MAKING TESTS (TMT A AND B), DIGIT SYMBOL SUBSTITUTION (DSST), AND WHO QUALITY OF LIFE-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF). ANALYSIS WAS BY INTENTION-TO-TREAT. MEDIATION ANALYSIS WAS DONE CONSIDERING OXIDATIVE STRESS MARKERS AS POTENTIAL MEDIATORS. RESULTS: AT THE END OF 6 MONTHS OF INTERVENTION, THE OVERALL FOLLOW-UP IN THE PARTICIPANTS WAS 87.85% (N = 123); 90% (N = 63) IN THE CONTROL GROUP, AND 85.71% IN THE YOGA GROUP (N = 60). THE MEAN AGE OF THE STUDY COHORT (N = 140) WAS 38.75 (SD = 7.50) YEARS. COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP, AT 24 WEEKS POST-INTERVENTION, THE BFY GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED STATUS OF THE RAW SAND Z SCORES MARKERS OF AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION, AFTER ADJUSTING FOR CONFOUNDERS, FEV1, FVC, FEF25-75 [Z SCORE-ADJUSTED MEAN DIFFERENCES (95% CI); 1.66 (1.10-2.21) 1.88 (1.21-2.55), AND 6.85 (5.12-8.57), RESPECTIVELY. A FRACTION OF FEF25-75 CHANGE (MEDIATION PERCENTAGE 23.95%) WAS EXPLAINED BY GLUTATHIONE AUGMENTATION. THERE WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN COGNITIVE SCORES OF DSST, TMT-A AND TMT-B, AND WHOQOL-BREF. CONCLUSION: IN CONCLUSION, REGULAR PRACTICE OF BFY COULD IMPROVE THE EXACERBATIONS IN THE MARKERS OF AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION IN CHRONICALLY PESTICIDE-EXPOSED FARMERS AND COGNITIVE VARIABLES. A SIGNIFICANT MEDIATING EFFECT OF GLUTATHIONE AUGMENTATION WAS ALSO OBSERVED CONCERNING THE EFFECT OF THE INTERVENTION ON FEF25-75. THESE FINDINGS PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF BENEFICIAL EVIDENCE OF THE BREATHING-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION THAT NEEDS VALIDATION ACROSS DIFFERENT FARMING ETHNICITIES.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION:WWW.CLINICALTRIALS.GOV, IDENTIFIER: CTRI/2019/11/021989.	2022	

2  418  51 BREATHING-FOCUSED YOGA AS AUGMENTATION FOR UNIPOLAR AND BIPOLAR DEPRESSION: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL: LE YOGA AXE SUR LA RESPIRATION COMME TRAITEMENT D'APPOINT POUR LA DEPRESSION UNIPOLAIRE ET BIPOLAIRE: UN ESSAI RANDOMISE CONTROLE. OBJECTIVE: PATIENTS WITH DEPRESSION FREQUENTLY EXPERIENCE PERSISTENT RESIDUAL SYMPTOMS EVEN WITH OPTIMAL INTERVENTIONS. THESE PATIENTS OFTEN USE COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENTS, INCLUDING YOGA, AS A PREFERRED ALTERNATIVE OR ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT. THERE IS EVIDENCE FOR THE BENEFIT OF YOGA FOR DEPRESSION, BUT THIS HAS NOT BEEN RIGOROUSLY EVALUATED, PARTICULARLY IN BIPOLAR DEPRESSION. WE AIMED TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND BENEFIT OF MANUALIZED BREATHING-FOCUSED YOGA IN COMPARISON TO PSYCHOEDUCATION AS AUGMENTATION TO PHARMACOTHERAPY FOR IMPROVING RESIDUAL SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION IN UNIPOLAR AND BIPOLAR PATIENTS. METHODS: USING A RANDOMIZED SINGLE-BLIND CROSSOVER DESIGN, 72 OUTPATIENTS WITH UNIPOLAR OR BIPOLAR DEPRESSION WERE AUGMENTED WITH THE TWO 8-WEEK INTERVENTIONS AT SEPARATE TIMES, AS ADD-ONS TO CURRENT FIRST-LINE ANTIDEPRESSANTS AND MOOD STABILIZERS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS THE MONTGOMERY-ASBERG DEPRESSION RATING SCALE (MADRS). DUE TO THE HIGH DROPOUT OF PARTICIPANTS AFTER CROSSOVER AT WEEK 8, ANALYSIS FOCUSED ON BETWEEN-GROUP COMPARISONS OF YOGA AND PSYCHOEDUCATION DURING THE INITIAL 8 WEEKS OF THE STUDY. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, AS MEASURED BY THE MADRS, FOLLOWING 8 WEEKS OF YOGA. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN MADRS RATINGS BETWEEN INTERVENTION GROUPS. SIMILAR IMPROVEMENTS IN SELF-RATED DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND WELL-BEING WERE ALSO OBSERVED ACROSS TIME. CONCLUSIONS: BOTH YOGA AND PSYCHOEDUCATION MAY IMPROVE RESIDUAL SYMPTOMS OF UNIPOLAR AND BIPOLAR DEPRESSION AS ADD-ON TO MEDICATIONS. IN-CLASS GROUP SESSIONS AND LONG STUDY DURATIONS MAY REDUCE FEASIBILITY FOR THIS POPULATION. LARGER TRIALS WITH PARALLEL GROUP DESIGN AND SHORTER DURATION MAY BE MORE FEASIBLE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
3  258  35 ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF A 12-WEEK YOGA VS. EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS): STUDY PROTOCOL FOR A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS) IS A COMMON AND BURDENSOME SLEEP DISORDER ASSOCIATED WITH PROFOUND IMPAIRMENT OF HEALTH, WELL-BEING, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. UNFORTUNATELY, THE MEDICATIONS USED FOR RLS MANAGEMENT CARRY RISK OF SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS, INCLUDING AUGMENTATION OF SYMPTOMS. YOGA, AN ANCIENT MIND-BODY DISCIPLINE DESIGNED TO PROMOTE PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, AND MENTAL WELL-BEING, MAY OFFER A VIABLE, LOW-RISK NEW TREATMENT. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF THIS PILOT, PARALLEL-ARM, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) ARE TO ASSESS THE ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF A 12-WEEK YOGA VS. EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RLS. METHODS: FORTY-FOUR ADULTS WITH CONFIRMED MODERATE TO SEVERE RLS WILL BE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED TO A 12-WEEK YOGA (N = 22) OR STANDARDIZED EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM (N = 22). YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS WILL ATTEND TWO 75-MIN IYENGAR YOGA CLASSES PER WEEK FOR THE FIRST 4 WEEKS, THEN ONE 75-MIN CLASS PER WEEK FOR THE REMAINING 8 WEEKS, AND WILL COMPLETE A 30-MIN HOMEWORK ROUTINE ON NON-CLASS DAYS. EDUCATIONAL FILM GROUP PARTICIPANTS WILL ATTEND ONE 75-MIN CLASS PER WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS AND COMPLETE A DAILY RLS TREATMENT LOG; CLASSES WILL INCLUDE INFORMATION ON: RLS MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING SLEEP HYGIENE PRACTICES; OTHER SLEEP DISORDERS; AND COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES LIKELY TO BE OF INTEREST TO THOSE PARTICIPATING IN A YOGA AND SLEEP EDUCATION STUDY. YOGA AND TREATMENT LOGS WILL BE COLLECTED WEEKLY. FEASIBILITY OUTCOMES WILL INCLUDE RECRUITMENT, ENROLLMENT, AND RANDOMIZATION RATES, RETENTION, ADHERENCE, AND PROGRAM SATISFACTION. PROGRAM EVALUATION AND YOGA-DOSING QUESTIONNAIRES WILL BE COLLECTED AT WEEK 12; DATA ON EXPLORATORY OUTCOMES (E.G., RLS SYMPTOM SEVERITY (IRLS), SLEEP QUALITY (PSQI), MOOD (POMS, PSS), AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (SF-36)) WILL BE GATHERED AT BASELINE AND WEEK 12. DISCUSSION: THIS STUDY WILL LAY THE ESSENTIAL GROUNDWORK FOR A PLANNED LARGER RCT TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF A YOGA PROGRAM FOR REDUCING SYMPTOMS AND ASSOCIATED BURDEN OF RLS. IF THE FINDINGS OF THE CURRENT TRIAL AND THE SUBSEQUENT LARGER RCTS ARE POSITIVE, THIS STUDY WILL ALSO HELP SUPPORT A NEW APPROACH TO CLINICAL TREATMENT OF THIS CHALLENGING DISORDER, HELP FOSTER IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF RLS ETIOLOGY, AND ULTIMATELY CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCING THE INDIVIDUAL, SOCIETAL, AND ECONOMIC BURDEN ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CONDITION.

4 1627  33 MINDFULNESS YOGA DURING PREGNANCY FOR PSYCHIATRICALLY AT-RISK WOMEN: PRELIMINARY RESULTS FROM A PILOT FEASIBILITY STUDY. PRENATAL PSYCHOPATHOLOGY MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON MOTHER AND BABY, BUT FEW WOMEN RECEIVE TREATMENT. WE OFFERED A 10-WEEK MINDFULNESS YOGA (M-YOGA) INTERVENTION TO PSYCHIATRICALLY HIGH-RISK PREGNANT WOMEN AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT. PARTICIPANTS (N = 18) WERE PRIMIPAROUS, 12-26 WEEKS PREGNANT, AND HAD ELEVATED SCORES (>9) ON THE EDINBURGH POSTNATAL DEPRESSION SCREEN AT BASELINE. IN ADDITION TO A BASELINE DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT, WOMEN COMPLETED SELF-RATINGS ON DEPRESSION, MINDFULNESS, AND MATERNAL-FETAL ATTACHMENT BEFORE AND AFTER M-YOGA. FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT M-YOGA WAS FEASIBLE, ACCEPTED AND EFFECTIVE. SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION WERE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED (P = 0.025), WHILE MINDFULNESS (P = 0.007) AND MATERNAL-FETAL ATTACHMENT (P = 0.000) SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED. OVERALL, THIS PILOT STUDY IS THE FIRST TO DEMONSTRATE THAT M-YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT ALTERNATIVE OR AUGMENTATION TO PHARMACOTHERAPY FOR PREGNANT WOMEN AT HIGH RISK FOR PSYCHOPATHOLOGY.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
5 2043  30 THE ACUTE EFFECTS OF VINYASA FLOW YOGA ON VASCULAR FUNCTION, LIPID AND GLUCOSE CONCENTRATIONS, AND MOOD. WHILE THE CHRONIC EFFECTS OF CERTAIN STYLES OF YOGA ON CARDIOMETABOLIC FACTORS HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE ACUTE EFFECTS OF A SINGLE YOGA SESSION ON THESE OUTCOMES. MOREOVER, VINYASA YOGA'S POTENTIAL TO MODULATE CARDIOMETABOLIC OUTCOMES HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DETERMINE THE ACUTE EFFECTS OF A VINYASA YOGA SESSION ON ARTERIAL STIFFNESS, WAVE REFLECTION, LIPID AND GLUCOSE CONCENTRATIONS, AND MOOD IN ADULTS WITH PRIOR YOGA EXPERIENCE. THIRTY YOGA PRACTITIONERS WITH A MINIMUM OF 3 MONTHS OF PRACTICE EXPERIENCE WERE ENROLLED INTO THE STUDY. CAROTID-FEMORAL PULSE WAVE VELOCITY (CF-PWV), AUGMENTATION INDEX (AIX), LIPID PROFILE, GLUCOSE CONCENTRATIONS, AND MOOD (POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECT SCALE) WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING A 1 -H VINYASA YOGA SESSION. AFTER THE YOGA SESSION, PARTICIPANTS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AIX (P < 0.001), NON-HDL CHOLESTEROL (P < 0.05), AND NEGATIVE AFFECT (P < 0.01) COMPARED TO BASELINE. THESE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE EFFICACY OF A SINGLE BOUT OF YOGA IN ALTERING WAVE REFLECTION WHILE IMPROVING MOOD AND LIPID CONCENTRATIONS IN HEALTHY ADULTS WITH A HISTORY OF YOGA PRACTICE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
6 2524  26 YOGA DURING PREGNANCY: EFFECTS ON MATERNAL COMFORT, LABOR PAIN AND BIRTH OUTCOMES. THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA PROGRAM DURING PREGNANCY, ON MATERNAL COMFORT, LABOR PAIN, AND BIRTH OUTCOMES. A RANDOMIZED TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED USING 74-PRIMIGRAVID THAI WOMEN WHO WERE EQUALLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS (EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL). THE YOGA PROGRAM INVOLVED SIX, 1-H SESSIONS AT PRESCRIBED WEEKS OF GESTATION. A VARIETY OF INSTRUMENTS WERE USED TO ASSESS MATERNAL COMFORT, LABOR PAIN AND BIRTH OUTCOMES. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS FOUND TO HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF MATERNAL COMFORT DURING LABOR AND 2H POST-LABOR, AND EXPERIENCED LESS SUBJECT EVALUATED LABOR PAIN THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. IN EACH GROUP, PAIN INCREASED AND MATERNAL COMFORT DECREASED AS LABOR PROGRESSED. NO DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND, BETWEEN THE GROUPS, REGARDING PETHIDINE USAGE, LABOR AUGMENTATION OR NEWBORN APGAR SCORES AT 1 AND 5 MIN. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS FOUND TO HAVE A SHORTER DURATION OF THE FIRST STAGE OF LABOR, AS WELL AS THE TOTAL TIME OF LABOR.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
7 2688  25 YOGA IN THE TREATMENT OF MOOD AND ANXIETY DISORDERS: A REVIEW. BACKGROUND: PATIENT USE OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS, INCLUDING YOGA, TO MANAGE MOOD AND ANXIETY DISORDERS, HAS BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED. DESPITE RESEARCH INTEREST, THERE ARE FEW RECENT REVIEWS OF THE EVIDENCE OF THE BENEFIT OF YOGA IN THESE CONDITIONS. METHOD: THE PUBMED, MEDLINE AND PSYCINFO DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR LITERATURE PUBLISHED UP TO JULY 2008, RELATING TO YOGA AND DEPRESSIVE AND ANXIETY DISORDERS. RESULTS: THE PAUCITY OF REPORTED STUDIES AND SEVERAL METHODOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS LIMIT DATA INTERPRETATION. IN DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS, YOGA MAY BE COMPARABLE TO MEDICATION AND THE COMBINATION SUPERIOR TO MEDICATION ALONE. THERE IS REASONABLE EVIDENCE FOR ITS USE AS SECOND-LINE MONOTHERAPY OR AUGMENTATION TO MEDICATION IN MILD TO MODERATE MAJOR DEPRESSION AND DYSTHYMIA, WITH EARLY EVIDENCE OF BENEFIT IN MORE SEVERE DEPRESSION. IN ANXIETY DISORDERS, YOGA MAY BE SUPERIOR TO MEDICATION FOR A SUBGROUP OF PATIENTS, BUT ITS BENEFITS IN SPECIFIC CONDITIONS ARE STILL LARGELY UNKNOWN. SECOND-LINE MONOTHERAPY IS INDICATED IN PERFORMANCE OR TEST ANXIETY, BUT ONLY PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE EXISTS FOR OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER AND POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. YOGA APPEARS TO BE SUPERIOR TO NO TREATMENT AND PROGRESSIVE RELAXATION FOR BOTH DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, AND MAY BENEFIT MOOD AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH MEDICAL ILLNESS. IT SHOWS GOOD SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY IN SHORT-TERM TREATMENT. CONCLUSION: REASONABLE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE BENEFIT OF YOGA IN SPECIFIC DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS. THE EVIDENCE IS STILL PRELIMINARY IN ANXIETY DISORDERS. GIVEN ITS PATIENT APPEAL AND THE PROMISING FINDINGS THUS FAR, FURTHER RESEARCH ON YOGA IN THESE CONDITIONS IS ENCOURAGED.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
8  778  31 EFFECT OF YOGA AND WORKING MEMORY TRAINING ON COGNITIVE COMMUNICATIVE ABILITIES AMONG MIDDLE AGED ADULTS. SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN COGNITIVE COMMUNICATIVE ABILITIES WITH WORKING MEMORY TRAINING AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPEUTIC METHODS CONDUCTED SEPARATELY. THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF COMBINING YOGA AND WORKING MEMORY TRAINING AMONG HEALTHY MIDDLE AGED ADULTS. A TOTAL OF 45 PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED INTO THREE GROUPS. GROUP 1 RECEIVED BOTH YOGA AND WORKING MEMORY TRAINING, GROUP 2 RECEIVED ONLY WORKING MEMORY TRAINING AND GROUP 3 SERVED AS THE CONTROL GROUP. WORKING MEMORY TRAINING WAS PROVIDED ON SIX TASKS. YOGA TRAINING INVOLVED PRANAYAMAS AND MUDRAS. EFFECTS OF TRAINING WERE ASSESSED ALONG WITH THE SELF-PERCEPTUAL RATING OF THE PARTICIPANTS TOWARDS TRAINING. RESULTS REVEAL GREATER TRAINING EFFECTS AMONG GROUP 1 PARTICIPANTS, FOLLOWED BY GROUP 2 AND GROUP 3. GROUP 1 ALSO REPORTED BETTER PERCEPTION OF TRAINING (P < 0.05) THAN GROUP 2. THE STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THAT YOGA IS NOT ONLY AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH, BUT ALSO AUGMENTATIVE IN IMPROVING COGNITIVE COMMUNICATIVE ABILITIES.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
9  682  42 EFFECT OF ADJUNCT YOGA THERAPY IN DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS: FINDINGS FROM A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. BACKGROUND: DEPRESSION CAUSES SIGNIFICANT BURDEN BOTH TO THE INDIVIDUAL AND TO SOCIETY, AND ITS TREATMENT BY ANTIDEPRESSANTS HAS VARIOUS DISADVANTAGES. THERE IS PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE THAT ADDS ON YOGA THERAPY IMPROVES DEPRESSION BY IMPACTING THE NEUROTRANSMITTERS INVOLVED IN THE REGULATION OF MOOD, MOTIVATION, AND PLEASURE. OUR STUDY AIMED TO FIND THE EFFECT OF ADJUNCTIVE YOGA THERAPY ON OUTCOME OF DEPRESSION AND COMORBID ANXIETY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY INVOLVING PATIENTS WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (N = 80) WERE ALLOCATED TO TWO GROUPS, ONE RECEIVED STANDARD THERAPY (ANTIDEPRESSANTS AND COUNSELING) AND THE OTHER RECEIVED ADJUNCT YOGA THERAPY ALONG WITH STANDARD THERAPY. RATINGS OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY WERE DONE USING MONTGOMERY-ASBERG DEPRESSION RATING SCALE AND HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE AT BASELINE, 10(TH) AND 30(TH) DAY. CLINICAL GLOBAL IMPRESSION (CGI) SCALE WAS APPLIED AT BASELINE AND 30(TH) DAY TO VIEW THE SEVERITY OF ILLNESS AND CLINICAL IMPROVEMENT. RESULTS: BY THE 30(TH) DAY, INDIVIDUALS IN THE YOGA GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER SCORES OF DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND CGI SCORES, IN COMPARISON TO THE CONTROL GROUP. THE INDIVIDUALS IN THE YOGA GROUP HAD A SIGNIFICANT FALL IN DEPRESSION SCORES AND SIGNIFICANT CLINICAL IMPROVEMENT, COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP, FROM BASELINE TO 30(TH) DAY AND 10(TH) TO 30(TH) DAY. IN ADDITION, THE INDIVIDUALS IN THE YOGA GROUP HAD A SIGNIFICANT FALL IN ANXIETY SCORES FROM BASELINE TO 10(TH) DAY. CONCLUSION: ANXIETY STARTS TO IMPROVE WITH SHORT-TERM YOGA SESSIONS, WHILE LONG-TERM YOGA THERAPY IS LIKELY TO BE BENEFICIAL IN THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
10  978  44 EFFECTS OF BODY-ORIENTED YOGA: A RCT STUDY FOR PATIENTS WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER. THE MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON MENTAL ILLNESSES WORLDWIDE. CURRENT TREATMENT STANDARDS RECOMMEND A COMBINED THERAPY WITH MEDICATION AND PSYCHOTHERAPY. AS AN ADDITIVE COMPONENT AND TO FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN TREATMENT, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY SUCH AS YOGA MAY BE INTEGRATED INTO CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE IMPACT OF A 3-MONTH BODY-ORIENTED YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD). IN TOTAL, N = 83 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED. AN INTERVENTION GROUP RECEIVED A VIGOROUS ASHTANGA-YOGA THREE TIMES A WEEK. THE WAITING-LIST CONTROL GROUP OBTAINED A TREATMENT AS USUAL (TAU). AS A PRIMARY OUTCOME DEPRESSION SCORES (BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY-II (BDI-II), MONTGOMERY ASBERG DEPRESSION RATING SCALE (MADRS)) WERE TESTED AT THREE TIME POINTS. SECONDARY OUTCOME WAS THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECT [POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECT SCALE (PANAS)] AND REMISSION RATES. TO ANALYZE THE DATA, MULTILEVEL MODELS AND EFFECT SIZES WERE CONDUCTED. THE RESULTS SHOWED AN IMPROVEMENT IN BDI-II SCORES FOR BOTH GROUPS OVER TIME [GAMMA = - 3.46, T(165) = - 7.99, P < 0.001] BUT NOT BETWEEN GROUPS [GAMMA = 0.98, T(164) = 1.12, P = 0.263]. AN INTERACTION EFFECT (TIME X GROUP) OCCURRED FOR MADRS [GAMMA = 2.10, T(164) = 2.10, P < 0.038]. POSITIVE AFFECTS IMPROVED OVER TIME FOR BOTH GROUPS [GAMMA = 1.65, T(165) = 4.03, P < 0.001]. NEGATIVE AFFECTS DECREASED FOR ALL OVER TIME [GAMMA = - 1.00, T(165) = - 2.51, P = 0.013]. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT GROUP DIFFERENCES IN PANAS. POST HOC TESTS REVEALED A GREATER SYMPTOM REDUCTION WITHIN THE FIRST 6 WEEKS FOR ALL MEASUREMENTS. THE EFFECT SIZES FOR DEPRESSION SCORES SHOWED A POSITIVE TREND. REMISSION RATES INDICATED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE YOGA GROUP (BDI-II: 46.81%, MADRS: 17.02%) COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP (BDI: 33.33%, MADRS: 8.33%). THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THERE IS A TRENDSETTING ADDITIVE EFFECT OF ASHTANGA-YOGA AFTER 3 MONTHS ON PSYCHOPATHOLOGY AND MOOD WITH A GREATER IMPROVEMENT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE INTERVENTION. FURTHER RESEARCH IN THIS FIELD CAN HELP TO ACHIEVE MORE DIFFERENTIATED RESULTS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
11 2732  33 YOGA ON OUR MINDS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF YOGA FOR NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS. BACKGROUND: THE DEMAND FOR CLINICALLY EFFICACIOUS, SAFE, PATIENT ACCEPTABLE, AND COST-EFFECTIVE FORMS OF TREATMENT FOR MENTAL ILLNESS IS GROWING. SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED BENEFIT FROM YOGA IN SPECIFIC PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS AND A GENERAL SENSE OF WELL-BEING. OBJECTIVE: TO SYSTEMATICALLY EXAMINE THE EVIDENCE FOR EFFICACY OF YOGA IN THE TREATMENT OF SELECTED MAJOR PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS. METHODS: ELECTRONIC SEARCHES OF THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS AND THE STANDARD BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATABASES, MEDLINE, EMBASE, AND PSYCINFO, WERE PERFORMED THROUGH APRIL 2011 AND AN UPDATED IN JUNE 2011 USING THE KEYWORDS YOGA AND PSYCHIATRY OR DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY OR SCHIZOPHRENIA OR COGNITION OR MEMORY OR ATTENTION AND RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT). STUDIES WITH YOGA AS THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE AND ONE OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED TERMS AS THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE WERE INCLUDED AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA WERE APPLIED. RESULTS: THE SEARCH YIELDED A TOTAL OF 124 TRIALS, OF WHICH 16 MET RIGOROUS CRITERIA FOR THE FINAL REVIEW. GRADE B EVIDENCE SUPPORTING A POTENTIAL ACUTE BENEFIT FOR YOGA EXISTS IN DEPRESSION (FOUR RCTS), AS AN ADJUNCT TO PHARMACOTHERAPY IN SCHIZOPHRENIA (THREE RCTS), IN CHILDREN WITH ADHD (TWO RCTS), AND GRADE C EVIDENCE IN SLEEP COMPLAINTS (THREE RCTS). RCTS IN COGNITIVE DISORDERS AND EATING DISORDERS YIELDED CONFLICTING RESULTS. NO STUDIES LOOKED AT PRIMARY PREVENTION, RELAPSE PREVENTION, OR COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS VERSUS PHARMACOTHERAPY. CONCLUSION: THERE IS EMERGING EVIDENCE FROM RANDOMIZED TRIALS TO SUPPORT POPULAR BELIEFS ABOUT YOGA FOR DEPRESSION, SLEEP DISORDERS, AND AS AN AUGMENTATION THERAPY. LIMITATIONS OF LITERATURE INCLUDE INABILITY TO DO DOUBLE-BLIND STUDIES, MULTIPLICITY OF COMPARISONS WITHIN SMALL STUDIES, AND LACK OF REPLICATION. BIOMARKER AND NEUROIMAGING STUDIES, THOSE COMPARING YOGA WITH STANDARD PHARMACO- AND PSYCHOTHERAPIES, AND STUDIES OF LONG-TERM EFFICACY ARE NEEDED TO FULLY TRANSLATE THE PROMISE OF YOGA FOR ENHANCING MENTAL HEALTH.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
12 2318  49 TREATING MAJOR DEPRESSION WITH YOGA: A PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED PILOT TRIAL. BACKGROUND: CONVENTIONAL PHARMACOTHERAPIES AND PSYCHOTHERAPIES FOR MAJOR DEPRESSION ARE ASSOCIATED WITH LIMITED ADHERENCE TO CARE AND RELATIVELY LOW REMISSION RATES. YOGA MAY OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT OPTION, BUT RIGOROUS STUDIES ARE FEW. THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH BLINDED OUTCOME ASSESSORS EXAMINED AN 8-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION AS MONO-THERAPY FOR MILD-TO-MODERATE MAJOR DEPRESSION. METHODS: INVESTIGATORS RECRUITED 38 ADULTS IN SAN FRANCISCO MEETING CRITERIA FOR MAJOR DEPRESSION OF MILD-TO-MODERATE SEVERITY, PER STRUCTURED PSYCHIATRIC INTERVIEW AND SCORES OF 14-28 ON BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY-II (BDI). AT SCREENING, INDIVIDUALS ENGAGED IN PSYCHOTHERAPY, ANTIDEPRESSANT PHARMACOTHERAPY, HERBAL OR NUTRACEUTICAL MOOD THERAPIES, OR MIND-BODY PRACTICES WERE EXCLUDED. PARTICIPANTS WERE 68% FEMALE, WITH MEAN AGE 43.4 YEARS (SD = 14.8, RANGE = 22-72), AND MEAN BDI SCORE 22.4 (SD = 4.5). TWENTY PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO 90-MINUTE HATHA YOGA PRACTICE GROUPS TWICE WEEKLY FOR 8 WEEKS. EIGHTEEN PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO 90-MINUTE ATTENTION CONTROL EDUCATION GROUPS TWICE WEEKLY FOR 8 WEEKS. CERTIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTORS DELIVERED BOTH INTERVENTIONS AT A UNIVERSITY CLINIC. PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS DEPRESSION SEVERITY, MEASURED BY BDI SCORES EVERY 2 WEEKS FROM BASELINE TO 8 WEEKS. SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE SELF-EFFICACY AND SELF-ESTEEM, MEASURED BY SCORES ON THE GENERAL SELF-EFFICACY SCALE (GSES) AND ROSENBERG SELF-ESTEEM SCALE (RSES) AT BASELINE AND AT 8 WEEKS. RESULTS: IN INTENT-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS, YOGA PARTICIPANTS EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER 8-WEEK DECLINE IN BDI SCORES THAN CONTROLS (P-VALUE = 0.034). IN SUB-ANALYSES OF PARTICIPANTS COMPLETING FINAL 8-WEEK MEASURES, YOGA PARTICIPANTS WERE MORE LIKELY TO ACHIEVE REMISSION, DEFINED PER FINAL BDI SCORE </= 9 (P-VALUE = 0.018). EFFECT SIZE OF YOGA IN REDUCING BDI SCORES WAS LARGE, PER COHEN'S D = -0.96 [95%CI, -1.81 TO -0.12]. INTERVENTION GROUPS DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY IN 8-WEEK CHANGE SCORES FOR EITHER THE GSES OR RSES. CONCLUSION: IN ADULTS WITH MILD-TO-MODERATE MAJOR DEPRESSION, AN 8-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION RESULTED IN STATISTICALLY AND CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN DEPRESSION SEVERITY.

13  945  45 EFFECTS OF A 12-WEEK YOGA VERSUS A 12-WEEK EDUCATIONAL FILM INTERVENTION ON SYMPTOMS OF RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME AND RELATED OUTCOMES: AN EXPLORATORY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. STUDY OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA VERSUS EDUCATIONAL FILM (EF) PROGRAM ON RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS) SYMPTOMS AND RELATED OUTCOMES IN ADULTS WITH RLS. METHODS: FORTY-ONE COMMUNITY-DWELLING, AMBULATORY NONPREGNANT ADULTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE RLS WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 12-WEEK YOGA (N = 19) OR EF PROGRAM (N = 22). IN ADDITION TO ATTENDING CLASSES, ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED PRACTICE/TREATMENT LOGS. YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO PRACTICE AT HOME 30 MINUTES PER DAY ON NONCLASS DAYS; EF PARTICIPANTS WERE INSTRUCTED TO RECORD ANY RLS TREATMENTS USED ON THEIR DAILY LOGS. CORE OUTCOMES ASSESSED PRETREATMENT AND POSTTREATMENT WERE RLS SYMPTOMS AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY (INTERNATIONAL RLS STUDY GROUP SCALE (IRLS) AND RLS ORDINAL SCALE), SLEEP QUALITY, MOOD, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). RESULTS: THIRTY ADULTS (13 YOGA, 17 EF), AGED 24 TO 73 (MEAN = 50.4 +/- 2.4 YEARS), COMPLETED THE 12-WEEK STUDY (78% FEMALE, 80.5% WHITE). POST-INTERVENTION, BOTH GROUPS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN RLS SYMPTOMS AND SEVERITY, PERCEIVED STRESS, MOOD, AND QOL-MENTAL HEALTH (P </= .04). RELATIVE TO THE EF GROUP, YOGA PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER REDUCTIONS IN RLS SYMPTOMS AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY (P </= .01), AND GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN PERCEIVED STRESS AND MOOD (P </= .04), AS WELL AS SLEEP QUALITY (P = .09); RLS SYMPTOMS DECREASED TO MINIMAL/MILD IN 77% OF YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS, WITH NONE SCORING IN THE SEVERE RANGE BY WEEK 12, VERSUS 24% AND 12%, RESPECTIVELY, IN EF PARTICIPANTS. IN THE YOGA GROUP, IRLS AND RLS SEVERITY SCORES DECLINED WITH INCREASING MINUTES OF HOMEWORK PRACTICE (R = .7, P = .009 AND R = .6, P = .03, RESPECTIVELY), SUGGESTING A POSSIBLE DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS OF THIS EXPLORATORY RCT SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING RLS SYMPTOMS AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY, DECREASING PERCEIVED STRESS, AND IMPROVING MOOD AND SLEEP IN ADULTS WITH RLS.

14  312  38 AN EXPLORATORY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF A 12-WEEK YOGA VERSUS EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME: FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY. OBJECTIVES: THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF THIS PILOT TRIAL WERE TO ASSESS THE STUDY FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF THE 12-WEEK YOGA AND EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAMS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS) IN PREPARATION FOR A FUTURE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS PILOT, PARALLEL-ARM, RANDOMIZED FEASIBILITY TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED AT TWO SITES, MORGANTOWN, WV AND COLUMBUS, OH. YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED 75-MIN IYENGAR YOGA CLASSES, TWICE WEEKLY FOR 4 WEEKS, THEN ONCE A WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS (16 TOTAL CLASSES), AND COMPLETED A 30-MIN HOMEWORK ROUTINE ON NONCLASS DAYS. EDUCATIONAL FILM GROUP PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED ONCE WEEKLY, 75-MIN CLASSES (12 TOTAL CLASSES), WHICH INCLUDED INFORMATION ON RLS AND OTHER SLEEP DISORDERS, RLS MANAGEMENT INCLUDING SLEEP HYGIENE PRACTICES, AND COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES. FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OUTCOMES INCLUDED PROGRAM SATISFACTION AND RECRUITMENT, RETENTION, AND ADHERENCE RATES. IN ADDITION, PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED THEIR PREFERENCES REGARDING THREE YOGA CLASS SCHEDULE SCENARIOS FOR A FUTURE STUDY. ATTENDANCE, YOGA, AND TREATMENT LOGS WERE COLLECTED WEEKLY. PROGRAM EVALUATION AND YOGA SCHEDULING QUESTIONNAIRES WERE COLLECTED AT WEEK 12. RESULTS: FORTY-ONE ADULTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE RLS WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 12-WEEK YOGA (N = 19) OR EDUCATIONAL FILM (N = 22) PROGRAM. THIRTY PARTICIPANTS (73%) COMPLETED THE PROGRAM. YOGA AND EDUCATION GROUP PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED AN AVERAGE OF 13.0 +/- 0.84 (81%) AND 10.3 +/- 0.3 CLASSES (85%), RESPECTIVELY. PARTICIPANTS FROM BOTH GROUPS INDICATED SATISFACTION WITH THE STUDY. ALL YOGA GROUP RESPONDENTS TO THE PROGRAM EVALUATION REPORTED THEY WOULD LIKELY (N = 6) OR VERY LIKELY (N = 7) CONTINUE YOGA PRACTICE; 86.7% OF EDUCATION GROUP RESPONDENTS (13 OF 15) INDICATED THAT THEY WERE LIKELY (N = 7) OR VERY LIKELY (N = 6) TO MAKE LASTING CHANGES BASED ON WHAT THEY HAD LEARNED. THE PREFERRED SCHEDULE FOR A FUTURE STUDY WAS A 16-WEEK STUDY WITH ONCE-WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES. CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT A LARGER RCT COMPARING YOGA WITH AN EDUCATIONAL FILM GROUP FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RLS IS FEASIBLE.

15  133  46 A PRAGMATIC PREFERENCE TRIAL OF THERAPEUTIC YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT TO GROUP COGNITIVE BEHAVIOUR THERAPY VERSUS GROUP CBT ALONE FOR DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY. BACKGROUND: YOGA HAS SEVERAL MECHANISMS THAT MAKE IT A PROMISING TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, INCLUDING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, BEHAVIOURAL ACTIVATION, AND MINDFULNESS. FOLLOWING POSITIVE OUTCOMES FROM ADAPTED CBT INTERVENTIONS INCORPORATING MINDFULNESS-BASED PRACTICES, THIS STUDY EXPLORED THE EFFECTS OF A THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM AS AN ADJUNCT TO GROUP-BASED CBT FOR DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY. METHODS: THIS WAS A PRAGMATIC PREFERENCE TRIAL INVOLVING ADULTS DIAGNOSED WITH DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY IN A REGIONAL PRIMARY MENTAL HEALTHCARE SERVICE (N = 59), COMPARING TRANSDIAGNOSTIC GROUP CBT (N = 27) WITH TRANSDIAGNOSTIC GROUP CBT COMBINED WITH AN ADJUNCT THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM (N = 32). A PREFERENCE RECRUITMENT DESIGN ALLOWED ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS (N = 35) TO SELF-SELECT INTO THE ADJUNCT PROGRAM. THE DEPRESSION ANXIETY STRESS SCALE-21 (DASS) WAS ASSESSED AT BASELINE, POST-INTERVENTION, AND THREE-MONTHS FOLLOW UP. RESULTS: CBT + YOGA WAS AN ACCEPTABLE ALTERNATIVE TO CBT ALONE. SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS WERE OBSERVED IN TOTAL DASS SCORES AND THE 3 SUBSCALES OF THE DASS FOR BOTH GROUPS, HOWEVER CBT + YOGA SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER DEPRESSIVE AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS POST-INTERVENTION, COMPARED TO CBT ALONE. CBT + YOGA ALSO SHOWED SUSTAINED REDUCTIONS IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS OVER THREE-MONTHS, AND MORE RAPID REDUCTIONS IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, COMPARED TO CBT ALONE. LIMITATIONS: THESE FINDINGS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED PRELIMINARY DUE TO THE MODERATE SAMPLE SIZE, WITH A RIGOROUS RANDOMISED CONTROL TRIAL NECESSARY TO DEFINITIVELY SUPPORT THE INTEGRATION OF YOGA WITHIN MENTAL HEALTH CARE TO AUGMENT THE BENEFITS AND UPTAKE OF TRANSDIAGNOSTIC CBT FOR DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY. CONCLUSIONS: COMPLEMENTING OTHER MINDFULNESS-BASED PRACTICES, THERAPEUTIC YOGA SHOWS PROMISE AS AN ADJUNCT TO TRANSDIAGNOSTIC CBT.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
16  176  44 A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF KUNDALINI YOGA IN MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT. BACKGROUND: GLOBAL POPULATION AGING WILL RESULT IN INCREASING RATES OF COGNITIVE DECLINE AND DEMENTIA. THUS, EFFECTIVE, LOW-COST, AND LOW SIDE-EFFECT INTERVENTIONS FOR THE TREATMENT AND PREVENTION OF COGNITIVE DECLINE ARE URGENTLY NEEDED. OUR STUDY IS THE FIRST TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF KUNDALINI YOGA (KY) TRAINING ON MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT (MCI). METHODS: OLDER PARTICIPANTS (>/=55 YEARS OF AGE) WITH MCI WERE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER A 12-WEEK KY INTERVENTION OR MEMORY ENHANCEMENT TRAINING (MET; GOLD-STANDARD, ACTIVE CONTROL). COGNITIVE (I.E. MEMORY AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING) AND MOOD (I.E. DEPRESSION, APATHY, AND RESILIENCE) ASSESSMENTS WERE ADMINISTERED AT BASELINE, 12 WEEKS AND 24 WEEKS. RESULTS: AT BASELINE, 81 PARTICIPANTS HAD NO SIGNIFICANT BASELINE GROUP DIFFERENCES IN CLINICAL OR DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS. AT 12 WEEKS AND 24 WEEKS, BOTH KY AND MET GROUPS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN MEMORY; HOWEVER, ONLY KY SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING. ONLY THE KY GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND RESILIENCE AT WEEK 12. CONCLUSION: KY GROUP SHOWED SHORT- AND LONG-TERM IMPROVEMENTS IN EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING AS COMPARED TO MET, AND BROADER EFFECTS ON DEPRESSED MOOD AND RESILIENCE. THIS OBSERVATION SHOULD BE CONFIRMED IN FUTURE CLINICAL TRIALS OF YOGA INTERVENTION FOR TREATMENT AND PREVENTION OF COGNITIVE DECLINE (NCT01983930).	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
17 1118  43 EFFICACY OF AN EIGHT-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION ON SYMPTOMS OF RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS): A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS) IS A COMMON AND HIGHLY BURDENSOME SLEEP DISORDER. WHILE RELAXATION THERAPIES, INCLUDING YOGA, ARE OFTEN RECOMMENDED FOR RLS MANAGEMENT, RIGOROUS SUPPORTING RESEARCH IS SPARSE. THE GOAL OF THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON RLS SYMPTOMS AND RELATED OUTCOMES IN WOMEN WITH RLS. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE 13 NONSMOKING WOMEN WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE RLS, WHO DID NOT HAVE DIABETES, SLEEP APNEA, OR OTHER SERIOUS CONCOMITANT CHRONIC CONDITIONS, AND WHO WERE NOT PREGNANT. THE INTERVENTION WAS A GENTLE, 8-WEEK IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM. CORE OUTCOMES ASSESSED PRE- AND POST-TREATMENT WERE RLS SYMPTOMS AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY (INTERNATIONAL RLS SCALE [IRLS] AND RLS ORDINAL SCALE), SLEEP QUALITY (MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY SLEEP SCALE), MOOD (PROFILE OF MOOD STATES), AND PERCEIVED STRESS (PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE). PARTICIPANTS ALSO COMPLETED YOGA LOGS AND A BRIEF EXIT QUESTIONNAIRE REGARDING THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH THE STUDY. RESULTS: TEN (10) WOMEN, AGED 32-66 YEARS, COMPLETED THE STUDY. PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED AN AVERAGE 13.4+/-0.5 (OF 16 POSSIBLE) CLASSES, AND COMPLETED A MEAN OF 4.1+/-0.3 (OF 5 POSSIBLE) HOMEWORK SESSIONS/WEEK. AT FOLLOW-UP, PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED STRIKING REDUCTIONS IN RLS SYMPTOMS AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY, WITH SYMPTOMS DECREASING TO MINIMAL/MILD IN ALL BUT 1 WOMAN AND NO PARTICIPANT SCORING IN THE SEVERE RANGE BY WEEK 8. EFFECT SIZES (COHEN'S D) WERE LARGE: 1.6 FOR IRLS TOTAL, AND 2.2 FOR RLS ORDINAL SCALE. IRLS SCORES DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH INCREASING MINUTES OF HOMEWORK PRACTICE PER SESSION (R=0.70, P=0.025) AND TOTAL HOMEWORK MINUTES (R=0.64, P<0.05), SUGGESTING A POSSIBLE DOSE-RESPONSE RELATION. PARTICIPANTS ALSO SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN SLEEP, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND MOOD (ALL P'S</=0.02), WITH EFFECT SIZES RANGING FROM 1.0 TO 1.6. CONCLUSIONS: THESE PRELIMINARY FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN ATTENUATING RLS SYMPTOMS AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY, REDUCING PERCEIVED STRESS, AND IMPROVING SLEEP AND MOOD IN WOMEN WITH RLS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
18  106  23 A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING PRENATAL YOGA TO PERINATAL HEALTH EDUCATION FOR ANTENATAL DEPRESSION. WE CONDUCTED A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) COMPARING A PRENATAL YOGA INTERVENTION TO PERINATAL-FOCUSED HEALTH EDUCATION IN PREGNANT WOMEN WITH DEPRESSION. FINDINGS DOCUMENT ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF THE YOGA INTERVENTION: NO YOGA-RELATED INJURIES WERE OBSERVED, INSTRUCTORS SHOWED FIDELITY TO THE YOGA MANUAL, AND WOMEN RATED INTERVENTIONS AS ACCEPTABLE. ALTHOUGH IMPROVEMENTS IN DEPRESSION WERE NOT STATISTICALLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN GROUPS, THEY FAVORED YOGA. THIS STUDY PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR A LARGER SCALE RCT EXAMINING PRENATAL YOGA TO IMPROVE MOOD DURING PREGNANCY.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
19 2441  37 YOGA AND SCHIZOPHRENIA-A COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF NEUROPLASTICITY: PROTOCOL FOR A SINGLE BLIND RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY OF YOGA IN SCHIZOPHRENIA. INTRODUCTION: SCHIZOPHRENIA IS ONE OF THE MOST SEVERE MENTAL DISORDERS WITH A PREVALENCE OF ABOUT 1% AND A LEADING CAUSE OF DISABILITY AMONG YOUNG ADULTS. PHARMACOTHERAPY IS THE MAINSTAY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. HOWEVER, EVEN WITH THE BEST OF MEDICATION, SEVERAL PROBLEMS LIKE REFRACTORINESS, NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS, FREQUENT RELAPSES, AND COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS PERSIST. METHODS: THIS IS A RANDOMIZED-CONTROLLED CLINICAL STUDY INCLUDING PATIENTS FROM AN URBAN TERTIARY HOSPITAL AND A SEMI-URBAN COMMUNITY CENTER, WITH A BETWEEN-GROUP, REPEATED-MEASURES, LONGITUDINAL DESIGN. THIS STUDY WILL RECRUIT 160 PATIENTS WITH DSM 5 DIAGNOSIS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA WHO ARE ON STABLE MEDICATION FOR A MINIMUM OF 6 WEEKS; THEY WILL BE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED INTO 2 ARMS VIZ., YOGA THERAPY (YT), AND TREATMENT-AS-USUAL (TAU) WITH 80 PATIENTS IN EACH ARM. PARTICIPANTS WILL UNDERGO CLINICAL, LABORATORY, AND RADIOLOGICAL ASSESSMENTS AT BASELINE AND AT INTERVALS OF 1 MONTH, 3 MONTHS, AND 6 MONTHS FROM THE BASELINE. IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT YOGA WILL IMPROVE PSYCHOPATHOLOGY AND EMOTION PROCESSING, INCREASE SERUM BRAIN DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR (BDNF) AND PLASMA OXYTOCIN LEVELS AND EFFECT CHANGES IN CEREBRAL ACTIVATION IN AREAS OF THE BRAIN ASSOCIATED WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA. DISCUSSION: THIS STUDY AIMS TO MEASURE THE EFFICACY OF A YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION AS AN ADJUNCT IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA AS WELL AS THE MECHANISMS OF THESE EFFECTS.

20 2132  37 THE EFFECTS OF A GENTLE YOGA PROGRAM ON SLEEP, MOOD, AND BLOOD PRESSURE IN OLDER WOMEN WITH RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS): A PRELIMINARY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE. TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA VERSUS AN EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM ON SLEEP, MOOD, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND SYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION IN OLDER WOMEN WITH RLS. METHODS. PARTICIPANTS WERE DRAWN FROM A LARGER TRIAL REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK PROFILES IN OVERWEIGHT, SEDENTARY POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. SEVENTY-FIVE WOMEN WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE EITHER AN 8-WEEK YOGA (N = 38) OR EDUCATIONAL FILM (N = 37) PROGRAM. ALL 75 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED AN RLS SCREENING QUESTIONNAIRE. THE 20 WOMEN WHO MET ALL FOUR DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR RLS (N = 10 YOGA, 10 FILM GROUP) COMPRISED THE POPULATION FOR THIS NESTED STUDY. MAIN OUTCOMES ASSESSED PRE- AND POST-TREATMENT INCLUDED: SLEEP (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX), STRESS (PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE), MOOD (PROFILE OF MOOD STATES, STATE-TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY), BLOOD PRESSURE, AND HEART RATE. RESULTS.

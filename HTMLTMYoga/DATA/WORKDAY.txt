1  256 148 A YOGA-BASED PROGRAM DECREASES PHYSICIAN BURNOUT IN NEONATOLOGISTS AND OBSTETRICIANS AT AN ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER. BACKGROUND: NEARLY HALF OF U.S. PEDIATRICIANS HAVE SYMPTOMS OF BURNOUT. THIS PILOT STUDY EXAMINED THE FEASIBILITY OF A 6-WEEK YOGA-BASED PROGRAM (RISE) FOR NEONATOLOGISTS AND OBSTETRICIANS AT BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL AND STUDIED THE EFFECTS ON BURNOUT, PROFESSIONAL FULFILLMENT, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED VIA EMAIL TO PARTICIPATE EITHER IN BOTH PROGRAM AND RESEARCH STUDY, OR EXCLUSIVELY THE PROGRAM. RISE WAS DELIVERED 1 HOUR/WEEK DURING THE WORKDAY FOR 6 CONSECUTIVE WEEKS EITHER IN-PERSON OR REMOTELY; 18 PHYSICIANS PARTICIPATED, 12 COMPLETED POST-PROGRAM, AND 11 COMPLETED 2-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. THE QUESTIONNAIRES ASSESSED BURNOUT AND MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH, PROFESSIONAL FULFILLMENT, WORK EXHAUSTION, INTERPERSONAL DISENGAGEMENT/BURNOUT (PFI), MINDFULNESS (FFMQ), PERCEIVED STRESS (PSS), POSITIVE/NEGATIVE AFFECT (PANAS), RESILIENCE (RS), ANXIETY/DEPRESSION/SLEEP DISTURBANCES (PROMIS), AT BASELINE, POST-PROGRAM, AND 2 MONTHS AFTER RISE. FINDINGS: AVERAGE ATTENDANCE IN-PERSON WAS 2.8 SESSIONS AND REMOTELY 1.4 SESSIONS (4.2/6 SESSIONS). PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATING TOTAL BURNOUT REDUCED FROM 50.0% AT BASELINE TO 9.1% POST-PROGRAM. PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATING PROFESSIONAL FULFILLMENT WERE 8.3% AT BASELINE AND 27.3% POST-PROGRAM. PAIRED SAMPLES T-TESTS REVEALED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN BURNOUT, PROFESSIONAL FULFILLMENT, INTERPERSONAL DISENGAGEMENT, STRESS, RESILIENCE, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION AT POST-PROGRAM COMPARED WITH BASELINE (N = 12, ALL PS < .05). AT 2-MONTH FOLLOW-UP, STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN INTERPERSONAL DISENGAGEMENT, RESILIENCE, AND MINDFULNESS (N = 11, ALL PS < .05) COMPARED WITH BASELINE WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS/APPLICATION TO PRACTICE: RISE IS FEASIBLE WITHIN A WORKDAY AND MAY ADDRESS BURNOUT AND OTHER PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH MEASURES IN PHYSICIANS WITH EFFECTS POTENTIALLY SUSTAINABLE OVER 2 MONTHS. OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH PRACTITIONERS IN HEALTH CARE SHOULD CONSIDER THIS TYPE OF INTERVENTION FOR THEIR WORKERS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                        
2 1430  48 IMPROVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH FOLLOWING A RESIDENTIAL YOGA-BASED PROGRAM FOR FRONTLINE PROFESSIONALS. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF A RESIDENTIAL YOGA-BASED PROGRAM ON PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH AND HEALTH BEHAVIORS IN FRONTLINE PROFESSIONALS. METHODS: FRONTLINE PROFESSIONALS FROM EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE, HUMAN SERVICES, AND CORRECTIONS PARTICIPATED IN THE RISE (RESILIENCE, INTEGRATION, SELF-AWARENESS, ENGAGEMENT) PROGRAM AND COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES AT BASELINE, POST-PROGRAM, AND 2 MONTHS FOLLOWING RISE. RESULTS: PAIRED SAMPLES T TESTS REVEALED IMPROVEMENTS IN MINDFULNESS, STRESS, RESILIENCE, AFFECT, AND SLEEP QUALITY FROM BASELINE TO POST-PROGRAM (ALL PS < 0.001, N = 55), WHICH WERE SUSTAINED AT THE 2-MONTH FOLLOW-UP (ALL PS < 0.01, N = 40). PARTICIPANTS ALSO REPORTED INCREASES IN EXERCISE, FRUIT, AND VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION POST-PROGRAM (ALL PS < 0.001), ALL OF WHICH PERSISTED AT THE 2-MONTH FOLLOW-UP (ALL PS < 0.01) EXCEPT EXERCISE. CONCLUSION: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT RISE IMPROVED INDICES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH AND HEALTHY BEHAVIORS THAT REMAINED 2 MONTHS FOLLOWING RISE.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
3 1364  38 IMPACT OF 10-MIN DAILY YOGA EXERCISES ON PHYSICAL AND MENTAL DISCOMFORT OF HOME-OFFICE WORKERS DURING COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF 10 MIN/DAY OF YOGA FOR 1 MONTH ON MUSCULOSKELETAL DISCOMFORT AND MOOD DISTURBANCE OF HOME-OFFICE WORKERS. BACKGROUND: THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC FORCED MANY PEOPLE TO SWITCH TO TELEWORKING. THE ABRUPT CHANGE FROM AN OFFICE SETTING TO AN IMPROVISED HOME-OFFICE MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE MUSCULOSKELETAL AND EMOTIONAL HEALTH OF WORKERS. BY PROVIDING MENTAL AND PHYSICAL EXERCISES, YOGA MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING ADVERSE EFFECTS. METHOD: FIFTY-FOUR PARTICIPANTS (42 WOMEN, 12 MEN) FOLLOWED A 1-MONTH YOGA PROGRAM, WHILE 40 PARTICIPANTS (26 WOMEN, 14 MEN) CONTINUED WITH THEIR COMMON WORK ROUTINE. THE CORNELL MUSCULOSKELETAL DISCOMFORT QUESTIONNAIRE WAS USED TO EVALUATE SEVERITY, INTERFERENCE WITH WORK AND FREQUENCY OF PAIN, AND TO OBTAIN A TOTAL DISCOMFORT SCORE FOR 25 BODY AREAS. MOOD DISTURBANCE WAS EVALUATED WITH THE PROFILE OF MOOD STATES QUESTIONNAIRE. BOTH GROUPS COMPLETED BOTH QUESTIONNAIRES, BEFORE AND AFTER THE EXPERIMENTATION PERIOD. RESULTS: AFTER 1 MONTH, FOR THE YOGA GROUP ONLY, SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS WERE OBSERVED IN THE DISCOMFORT OF EYES, HEAD, NECK, UPPER AND LOWER BACK, RIGHT WRIST, AND HIPS/BUTTOCKS, AS WELL AS REDUCTIONS IN DISCOMFORT SEVERITY, FREQUENCY AND INTERFERENCE FOR THE NECK, UPPER AND LOWER BACK. TOTAL MOOD DISTURBANCE WAS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED FOR THE YOGA GROUP ONLY. NO FAVORABLE CHANGES OCCURRED FOR THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: THE YOGA INTERVENTION PROGRAM APPEARS TO REDUCE MUSCULOSKELETAL DISCOMFORT AND MOOD DISTURBANCE OF HOME-OFFICE WORKERS. APPLICATION: SEDENTARY WORKERS MAY BENEFIT FROM 10 MIN/DAY OF YOGA DURING THE WORKDAY TO ATTENUATE POTENTIAL PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL DISCOMFORT DURING THE CURRENT PANDEMIC AND BEYOND.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
4 1428  57 IMPROVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING FOLLOWING A BRIEF YOGA-BASED PROGRAM FOR EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS WHO ATTENDED A YOGA-BASED PROGRAM. METHODS: EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS WHO ATTENDED A 3-DAY YOGA-BASED RISE (RESILIENCE, INTEGRATION, SELF-AWARENESS, ENGAGEMENT) PROGRAM WERE RECRUITED TO PARTICIPATE. RISE WAS ADMINISTERED AT THE KRIPALU CENTER FOR YOGA & HEALTH. MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING, AND HEALTH-RELATED BEHAVIORS WERE COMPLETED BEFORE (BASELINE), AFTER (POST), AND 2 MONTHS AFTER RISE (FOLLOW-UP). FORTY-FOUR PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED BASELINE AND POST AND WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. OF THOSE, 33 PARTICIPANTS ALSO COMPLETED THE FOLLOW-UP. PAIRED SAMPLES T TESTS WERE USED TO COMPARE SCORES BETWEEN TIME POINTS. RESULTS: COMPARED TO BASELINE, AT POST, PARTICIPANTS SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS IN PERCEIVED STRESS, MINDFULNESS, EMPOWERMENT, POSITIVE AFFECT, NEGATIVE AFFECT, SELF-COMPASSION, TOTAL WORK ENGAGEMENT, VIGOR, SLEEP QUALITY (ALL P VALUES < .001), RESILIENCE, SATISFACTION WITH LIFE, AS WELL AS EXHAUSTION AND PROFESSIONAL EFFICACY WHICH ARE DIMENSIONS OF BURNOUT (ALL P VALUES < .01). AT THE FOLLOW-UP, SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE MAINTAINED FOR MINDFULNESS, EMPOWERMENT, SELF-COMPASSION, SLEEP QUALITY (ALL P VALUES < .001), RESILIENCE, VIGOR, AND EXHAUSTION (ALL P VALUES < .01) AND POSITIVE AFFECT, SATISFACTION WITH LIFE, AND WORK ENGAGEMENT (ALL P VALUES < .05). CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE YOGA-BASED RISE PROGRAM IMPROVES PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS. IN ADDITION, PARTICIPANTS REPORTED THAT ATTENDING RISE WAS FEASIBLE, THEY COULD CONTINUE USING RISE PRACTICES LONG-TERM, SHARED THEM WITH WORK COLLEAGUES, AND REPORTED THAT RISE POSITIVELY IMPACTED BOTH THEIR DAILY LIVES AND WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT. WITH THESE PROMISING RESULTS, ADDITIONAL CONTROLLED RESEARCH IS WARRANTED.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
5  911  39 EFFECTIVENESS OF INTEGRATIVE RESTORATION (IREST) YOGA NIDRA ON MINDFULNESS, SLEEP, AND PAIN IN HEALTH CARE WORKERS. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTEGRATIVE RESTORATION (IREST) YOGA NIDRA MEDITATION ON MINDFULNESS, SLEEP, AND PAIN IN HEALTH CARE WORKERS. AS HEALTH CARE WORKERS PROVIDE EMOTIONAL SUPPORT TO PATIENTS, IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR WORKERS TO EXPERIENCE BOTH PHYSICAL AND MENTAL EXHAUSTION. ONE HOLISTIC APPROACH TO SUPPORT EMPLOYEES IS MINDFULNESS TRAINING. IREST YOGA NIDRA IS A COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH THERAPY THAT INCREASES MINDFULNESS. A PRE-/POSTINTERVENITON DESCRIPTIVE SURVEY DESIGN WAS USED. BEFORE AND AFTER EXPERIENCING IREST MEDITATION, PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED A 51-ITEM QUESTIONNAIRE CONSISTING OF DEMOGRAPHICS PLUS 3 VALIDATED INSTRUMENTS: THE FIVE-FACET MINDFULNESS QUESTIONNAIRE (FFMQ), THE EPWORTH SLEEPINESS SCALE (ESS), AND DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE/VETERANS ADMINISTRATION (DOD/VA) PAIN SUPPLEMENTAL QUESTIONS (PSQ). A TOTAL OF 15 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED BOTH QUESTIONNAIRES. POSTINTERVENTION FFMQ SCORES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN PREINTERVENTION (Z = -3.294, P = .001). THE HIGHEST SUBSCALE SCORES WERE "ACTING WITH AWARENESS" AND "NONJUDGING OF INNER EXPERIENCE." THERE WAS A NOT A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE MEAN ESS SCORES AT BASELINE AND FOLLOW-UP. HOWEVER, THERE WAS A STRONG NEGATIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE MEAN ESS IMPROVEMENT SCORE AND THE NUMBER OF WEEKS ATTENDED (RS = -0.705, P = .003). THERE WAS A NOT A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE MEAN PAIN BASELINE AND FOLLOW-UP SCORES. THIS STUDY SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN MINDFULNESS OF HEALTH CARE WORKERS FOLLOWING A GUIDED 8-WEEK IREST YOGA NIDRA PROGRAM. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY MAY PROVIDE SOME INSIGHT INTO HELPING HEALTH CARE WORKERS DEAL WITH THE DEMANDS OF THEIR PROFESSION IN A POSITIVE MANNER, THUS LEADING TO AN IMPROVED WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
6   38  48 A 3-DAY RESIDENTIAL YOGA-BASED PROGRAM IMPROVES EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS' PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH IN A SINGLE ARM TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY EXAMINED CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH IN URBAN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS AFTER ATTENDING A BRIEF YOGA-BASED PROGRAM. METHODS: EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS FROM THE NEW YORK CITY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION (NYC DOE) WHO WERE ATTENDING A RESIDENTIAL 3-DAY YOGA-BASED PROGRAM AT KRIPALU CENTER FOR YOGA & HEALTH WERE RECRUITED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY. MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND HEALTH-RELATED BEHAVIORS WERE COMPLETED BEFORE (BASELINE), AFTER (POST), AND TWO MONTHS AFTER THE PROGRAM (FOLLOW-UP). PAIRED SAMPLES T-TESTS WERE USED TO COMPARE SCORES BETWEEN TIME POINTS. RESULTS: AT POST, PARTICIPANTS (N=74) SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS IN STRESS, RESILIENCE, AFFECT, MINDFULNESS, EMPOWERMENT, SELF-COMPASSION, SATISFACTION WITH LIFE, WORK ENGAGEMENT, BURNOUT, EXERCISE, AND VEGETABLE INTAKE (ALL P VALUES < 0.05) COMPARED TO BASELINE. AT THE FOLLOW-UP (N=33), SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS IN RESILIENCE, AFFECT, MINDFULNESS, EMPOWERMENT, SELF-COMPASSION, WORK ENGAGEMENT, AND BURNOUT (ALL P VALUES < 0.05) COMPARED TO BASELINE. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS BETWEEN THE DEGREE OF HOME PRACTICE OF THE SKILLS AND TECHNIQUES LEARNED IN THE PROGRAM AND IMPROVEMENTS IN MULTIPLE MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AT FOLLOW-UP (ALL P VALUES < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE YOGA-BASED PROGRAM IMPROVES PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND HEALTHY BEHAVIORS IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE PROGRAM AND UP TO TWO-MONTHS FOLLOWING THE PROGRAM, HOWEVER, MORE DATA WITH LARGER SAMPLE SIZES ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM SUSTAINED BENEFITS OVER THE LONGER TERM.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
7 1372  44 IMPACT OF A YOGA AND MEDITATION INTERVENTION ON STUDENTS' STRESS AND ANXIETY LEVELS. OBJECTIVE. TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF A SIX-WEEK YOGA AND MEDITATION INTERVENTION ON COLLEGE STUDENTS' STRESS PERCEPTION, ANXIETY LEVELS, AND MINDFULNESS SKILLS. METHODS. COLLEGE STUDENTS PARTICIPATED IN A SIX-WEEK PILOT PROGRAM THAT CONSISTED OF A 60-MINUTE VINYASA FLOW YOGA CLASS ONCE WEEKLY, FOLLOWED BY GUIDED MEDITATION DELIVERED BY TRAINED FACULTY MEMBERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND COLLEGE OF PHARMACY. STUDENTS COMPLETED PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION QUESTIONNAIRES TO EVALUATE CHANGES IN THE FOLLOWING OUTCOMES: STRESS LEVELS, ANXIETY LEVELS, AND MINDFULNESS SKILLS. THE QUESTIONNAIRE CONSISTED OF THREE SELF-REPORTING TOOLS: THE BECK ANXIETY INVENTORY (BAI), THE PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE (PSS), AND THE FIVE FACET MINDFULNESS QUESTIONNAIRE (FFMQ). STUDENTS' SCORES ON EACH WERE ASSESSED TO DETECT ANY CHANGES FROM BASELINE USING THE NUMERICAL AND CATEGORICAL SCALES (LOW, MEDIUM, AND HIGH) FOR EACH INSTRUMENT. RESULTS. SEVENTEEN PARTICIPANTS, AGED 19 TO 23 YEARS, COMPLETED THE STUDY. THIRTEEN PARTICIPANTS WERE FEMALE AND FOUR WERE MALE. NINE OF THE STUDENTS WERE ENROLLED IN THE DOCTOR OF PHARMACY PROGRAM AND EIGHT WERE ENROLLED IN OTHER ACADEMIC PROGRAMS. STUDENTS' ANXIETY AND STRESS SCORES DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY WHILE THEIR TOTAL MINDFULNESS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. CHANGES IN CATEGORICAL DATA FROM PRE- TO POST-INTERVENTION ON THE BAI AND PSS WERE SIGNIFICANT, WITH NO STUDENTS SCORING IN THE "HIGH" CATEGORY FOR STRESS OR ANXIETY ON THE POST-INTERVENTION QUESTIONNAIRE. CONCLUSION. STUDENTS EXPERIENCED A REDUCTION IN STRESS AND ANXIETY LEVELS AFTER COMPLETING A SIX-WEEK YOGA AND MEDITATION PROGRAM PRECEDING FINAL EXAMINATIONS. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ADOPTING A MINDFULNESS PRACTICE FOR AS LITTLE AS ONCE PER WEEK MAY REDUCE STRESS AND ANXIETY IN COLLEGE STUDENTS. ADMINISTRATORS SHOULD CONSIDER INCLUDING INSTRUCTION IN NONPHARMACOLOGIC STRESS AND ANXIETY REDUCTION METHODS, WITHIN CURRICULA IN ORDER TO SUPPORT STUDENT SELF-CARE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
8  130  39 A PRAGMATIC CONTROLLED TRIAL OF A BRIEF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED PROGRAM FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS. OBJECTIVES: TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELLBEING IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS THAT ATTENDED A BRIEF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED PROGRAM. DESIGN: PRAGMATIC CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS THAT ATTENDED A YOGA MINDFULNESS-BASED PROGRAM (N = 9) TO A WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 22). SETTING: THE 3-DAY PROGRAM WAS DELIVERED AT THE KRIPALU CENTER FOR YOGA & HEALTH IN MASSACHUSETTS. INTERVENTION: THE 3-DAY YOGA MINDFULNESS PROGRAM INCLUDED 5 HOURS PER DAY OF YOGA, MINDFULNESS EXERCISES, FORMAL MEDITATION, DIDACTIC, AND EXPERIENTIAL ACTIVITIES. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELLBEING WERE COMPLETED BEFORE (BASELINE), IMMEDIATELY AFTER (POST-PROGRAM), AND TWO MONTHS AFTER THE PROGRAM (FOLLOW-UP). RESULTS: RELATIVE TO CONTROLS (N = 21), THE RISE GROUP (N = 9) SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN POSITIVE AFFECT (P = .033), NEGATIVE AFFECT (P = .044), MINDFULNESS (P = .001), EMPOWERMENT (P = .022), SELF-COMPASSION (P = .001), AND WORK ENGAGEMENT FROM BASELINE TO POST-PROGRAM. FROM BASELINE TO FOLLOW-UP, THE RISE GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN STRESS (P = .008), NEGATIVE AFFECT (P = .013), MINDFULNESS (P = .001), EMPOWERMENT (P = .007), AND SELF-COMPASSION (P = .001) COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: THE YOGA MINDFULNESS PROGRAM WAS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN EDUCATORS' PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELLBEING IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING AND 2-MONTHS FOLLOWING THE PROGRAM. FUTURE RESEARCH WITH A LARGER SAMPLE SIZE IS NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE RESULTS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
9 1367  33 IMPACT OF A MINDFULNESS-BASED, WORKPLACE GROUP YOGA INTERVENTION ON BURNOUT, SELF-CARE, AND COMPASSION IN HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER A WORKPLACE, GROUP MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION COULD HELP MANAGE BURNOUT AND IMPROVE WELLBEING AMONG HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 43 HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS PARTICIPATED IN 8-WEEK SUPERVISED WORKPLACE, GROUP MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA ACTIVITIES. THE AUTHORS USED A SINGLE-SAMPLE, PRE-POST DESIGN. AT TWO POINTS IN TIME (BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION), PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED A SET OF ONLINE MEASURES ASSESSING BURNOUT, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, STRESS, RESILIENCE, AND COMPASSION. THE AUTHORS USED LINEAR MIXED MODEL ANALYSIS TO ASSESS CHANGES IN OUTCOME MEASURES. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS HAD IMPROVEMENTS AFTER THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION. AT POSTINTERVENTION, THEY HAD SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER SCORES ON PERSONAL ACCOMPLISHMENT, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, STRESS, PERCEIVED RESILIENCE, AND COMPASSION. PARTICIPANTS HAD A POSITIVE PERCEPTION OF THE YOGA INTERVENTION. CONCLUSION: GROUP MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA PROGRAM MAY BE CONVENIENT AND LOW-COST APPROACH TO SUPPORT HEALTH AND WELLBEING AMONG HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
10 1429  42 IMPROVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING IN A PRAGMATIC CONTROLLED TRIAL OF A YOGA-BASED PROGRAM FOR PROFESSIONALS. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PRAGMATIC CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING IN PROFESSIONALS WHO ATTENDED A YOGA-BASED PROGRAM. SETTING: THE 5-DAY RISE (RESILIENCE, INTEGRATION, SELF-AWARENESS, ENGAGEMENT) PROGRAM WAS DELIVERED AT THE KRIPALU CENTER FOR YOGA & HEALTH. RISE INCLUDED 5 H PER DAY OF YOGA, MEDITATION, LECTURES, AND EXPERIENTIAL ACTIVITIES. SUBJECTS: ADULT PROFESSIONALS FROM EDUCATION, CORRECTIONS, AND SOCIAL SERVICE INSTITUTIONS WERE PRAGMATICALLY ASSIGNED TO THE RISE GROUP (N = 61) OR A WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 60). OUTCOME MEASURES: MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING WERE COMPLETED BEFORE RISE (BASELINE), IMMEDIATELY AFTER RISE (POSTPROGRAM), AND 2 MONTHS AFTER RISE (FOLLOW-UP). ANALYSES OF COVARIANCE WERE CONDUCTED TO COMPARE CHANGE SCORES BETWEEN GROUPS. RESULTS: EIGHTY-TWO PARTICIPANTS (RISE N = 41, CONTROL N = 41) COMPLETED BASELINE AND POSTMEASURES AND WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS, AND 57 (RISE N = 27, CONTROL N = 30) ALSO COMPLETED THE FOLLOW-UP. RELATIVE TO CONTROLS, THE RISE GROUP REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN STRESS (P = 0.001, R(2) = 0.51), RESILIENCE (P = 0.028, R(2) = 0.34), POSITIVE AFFECT (P = 0.001, R(2) = 0.52), NEGATIVE AFFECT (P = 0.001, R(2) = 0.52), MINDFULNESS (P = 0.021, R(2) = 0.13), AND JOB SATISFACTION (P = 0.034, R(2) = 0.08) FROM BASELINE TO POSTPROGRAM. FROM BASELINE TO FOLLOW-UP, COMPARED WITH CONTROLS THE RISE GROUP SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS IN STRESS (P = 0.001, R(2) = 0.33), RESILIENCE (P = 0.001, R(2) = 0.24), POSITIVE AFFECT (P = 0.006, R(2) = 0.49), NEGATIVE AFFECT (P = 0.043, R(2) = 0.32), MINDFULNESS (P = 0.001, R(2) = 0.28), EMPOWERMENT (P = 0.005, R(2) = 0.20), AND SELF-COMPASSION (P = 0.011, R(2) = 0.19). CONCLUSIONS: THE RISE PROGRAM WAS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING IMMEDIATELY AFTER AND 2 MONTHS AFTER THE PROGRAM. FUTURE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE RESULTS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                    
11 1255  48 FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND OUTCOMES OF A YOGA-BASED MEDITATION INTERVENTION FOR HOSPICE PROFESSIONALS TO COMBAT BURNOUT. (1) BACKGROUND. THIS RESEARCH EXAMINED THE FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY AND OUTCOMES OF DELIVERING A 6-WEEK YOGA-BASED MEDITATION INTERVENTION TO CLINICAL TEAMS OF HOSPICE PROFESSIONALS (HPS) AT A LARGE NON-PROFIT HOSPICE ORGANIZATION. THE INTERVENTION WAS DESIGNED TO INCREASE MIND-BODY INTEGRATION AND COMBAT BURNOUT. THIS ARTICLE WAS WRITTEN FOR DIFFERENT AUDIENCES, INCLUDING RESEARCH SCIENTISTS WHO STUDY INTEROCEPTION, BURNOUT, MEDITATION, OR YOGA, DESIGNERS OF MEDITATION INTERVENTIONS, AND HOSPICE ORGANIZATIONS LOOKING FOR WAYS TO MITIGATE HP BURNOUT. (2) METHODS. THE INTERVENTION WAS LAUNCHED WITHIN CLINICAL TEAMS, BEGINNING WITH A HALF-HOUR ONLINE INTRODUCTION TO THE PROGRAM AND EXPOSURE TO THE WEEK 1 MEDITATION AT EACH TEAM'S MONTHLY ALL-STAFF MEETING. THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAM, HPS COULD ACCESS THE MEDITATIONS ON THEIR OWN VIA THEIR WORKPLACE COMPUTERS, TABLETS, AND SMARTPHONES. ONLINE PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION SURVEYS WERE SUBMITTED BY 151 HPS, 76 OF WHOM WERE EXPOSED TO THE INTERVENTION AND COMPLETED BOTH SURVEYS. THE SURVEYS ASSESSED BURNOUT USING THE PROFESSIONAL FULFILLMENT INDEX AND MIND-BODY INTEGRATION USING THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL ASSESSMENT OF INTEROCEPTIVE AWARENESS SCALES. (3) RESULTS. TWO-THIRDS OF HPS WHO WERE PRESENT AT A STAFF MEETING WHERE THE PROGRAM WAS INTRODUCED WENT ON TO DO A MEDITATION ON THEIR OWN AT LEAST ONCE. HALF OF HPS EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO CONTINUE WITH ACCESS TO THE MEDITATIONS AFTER THE 6-WEEK PROGRAM ENDED. DUE TO COVID-19 WORK FROM HOME RESTRICTIONS, THREE-FOURTH OF HPS DID A MEDITATION AT HOME, 29% IN A CAR BETWEEN PATIENT VISITS (NOT WHILE DRIVING), AND 23% AT THE OFFICE. HIGHER INTEROCEPTIVE AWARENESS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO LOWER BURNOUT, PARTICULARLY LOWER WORK EXHAUSTION. MEDITATION FREQUENCY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO HIGHER INTEROCEPTIVE AWARENESS BUT NOT TO BURNOUT. INTERPERSONAL DISENGAGEMENT WAS RARE AND TEMPORARY. (4) CONCLUSIONS. FINDINGS SHOWED THAT THE YOGA-BASED MEDITATION INTERVENTION WAS FEASIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE AND ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER INTEROCEPTIVE AWARENESS. THE RESULTS POINT TO A ROLE FOR INTEROCEPTIVE AWARENESS IN REDUCING THE RISK FOR BURNOUT.	2021	

12 1174  52 EVALUATION OF A YOGA-BASED MIND-BODY INTERVENTION FOR RESIDENT PHYSICIANS: A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS (MBIS) HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL INTERVENTIONS FOR MITIGATING PHYSICIAN BURNOUT, BUT THERE ARE NO CONTROLLED STUDIES OF YOGA-BASED MBIS IN RESIDENT PHYSICIANS. WE ASSESSED THE FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA-BASED MBI CALLED RISE (RESILIENCE, INTEGRATION, SELF-AWARENESS, ENGAGEMENT) FOR RESIDENTS AMONG MULTIPLE SPECIALTIES AND ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A WAITLIST CONTROLLED RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL OF THE RISE PROGRAM WITH RESIDENTS FROM MULTIPLE SPECIALTY DEPARTMENTS AT THREE ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS. THE RISE PROGRAM CONSISTED OF SIX WEEKLY SESSIONS WITH SUGGESTED HOME PRACTICE. FEASIBILITY WAS ASSESSED ACROSS SIX DOMAINS: DEMAND, IMPLEMENTATION, PRACTICALITY, ACCEPTABILITY, ADAPTATION, AND INTEGRATION. SELF-REPORTED MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE, POST-PROGRAM, AND TWO-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: AMONG 2,000 RESIDENTS CONTACTED, 75 WERE ASSESSED FOR ELIGIBILITY AND 56 WERE ENROLLED. FORTY-FOUR PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE STUDY AND WERE INCLUDED IN ANALYSIS. ON AVERAGE, PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED TWO OF SIX SESSIONS. FEASIBILITY OF IN-PERSON ATTENDANCE WAS RATED AS 28.9 (SD 25.6) ON A 100-POINT VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE. PARTICIPANTS RATED FEASIBILITY AS 69.2 (SD 26.0) IF THE PROGRAM WAS OFFERED VIRTUALLY. THOSE WHO RECEIVED RISE REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN MINDFULNESS, STRESS, BURNOUT, AND PHYSICIAN WELL-BEING FROM BASELINE TO POST-PROGRAM, WHICH WERE SUSTAINED AT TWO-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. CONCLUSION: THIS IS THE FIRST CONTROLLED STUDY OF A YOGA-BASED MBI IN RESIDENTS. WHILE THE PROGRAM WAS NOT FEASIBLE AS DELIVERED IN THIS PILOT STUDY, INITIAL ANALYSES SHOWED IMPROVEMENT IN MULTIPLE MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH. RESIDENTS REPORTED THAT VIRTUAL DELIVERY WOULD INCREASE FEASIBILITY.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
13 1832  40 PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING, HEALTH BEHAVIORS, AND WEIGHT LOSS AMONG PARTICIPANTS IN A RESIDENTIAL, KRIPALU YOGA-BASED WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM. UNLABELLED: THE INCREASING PREVALENCE OF OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY IN HUMANS IS A GROWING PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN IN THE UNITED STATES. CONCOMITANTS INCLUDE POOR HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND REDUCED PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING. PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE SUGGESTS YOGA AND TREATMENT PARADIGMS INCORPORATING MINDFULNESS, SELF-COMPASSION (SC), ACCEPTANCE, NON-DIETING, AND INTUITIVE EATING MAY IMPROVE THESE ANCILLARY CORRELATES, WHICH MAY PROMOTE LONG-TERM WEIGHT LOSS. METHODS: WE EXPLORED THE IMPACT OF A 5-DAY RESIDENTIAL WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM, WHICH WAS MULTIFACETED AND BASED ON KRIPALU YOGA, ON HEALTH BEHAVIORS, WEIGHT LOSS, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING IN OVERWEIGHT/OBESE INDIVIDUALS. THIRTY-SEVEN OVERWEIGHT/OBESE PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS (AGE 32-65, BMI<25) COMPLETED VALIDATED MIND-FULNESS, SC, LIFESTYLE BEHAVIOR, AND MOOD QUESTIONNAIRES AT BASELINE, POST-PROGRAM, AND 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP AND REPORTED THEIR WEIGHT 1 YEAR AFTER PROGRAM COMPLETION. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN NUTRITION BEHAVIORS, SC, MINDFULNESS, STRESS MANAGEMENT, AND SPIRITUAL GROWTH WERE OBSERVED IMMEDIATELY POST-PROGRAM (N = 31, 84% RETENTION), WITH MEDIUM TO LARGE EFFECT SIZES. AT 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP (N = 18, 49% RETENTION), MOST CHANGES PERSISTED. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND MOOD DISTURBANCE HAD IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY POST-PROGRAM BUT FAILED TO REACH SIGNIFICANCE AT 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. SELF-REPORT WEIGHT LOSS AT 1 YEAR (N = 19, 51% RETENTION) WAS SIGNIFICANT. CONCLUSION: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST A KRIPALU YOGA-BASED, RESIDENTIAL WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM MAY FOSTER PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING, IMPROVED NUTRITION BEHAVIORS, AND WEIGHT LOSS. GIVEN THE EXPLORATORY NATURE OF THIS INVESTIGATION, MORE RIGOROUS WORK IN THIS AREA IS WARRANTED.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
14 2553  33 YOGA FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS AFTER COMPLETING CANCER TREATMENT. SURVIVORS OF CHILDHOOD CANCER MAY EXPERIENCE PERSISTENT SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, AND BALANCE IMPAIRMENT. YOGA IS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY THAT IMPROVES FATIGUE, SLEEP, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN ADULT CANCER SURVIVORS. USING A ONE GROUP, REPEATED MEASURES DESIGN, WE EVALUATED THE FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA PROGRAM AND ASSESSED IF CANCER SURVIVOR PARTICIPANTS AGES 10 TO 17 YEARS (N = 13) HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LESS FATIGUE AND ANXIETY, AND BETTER BALANCE AND SLEEP, AFTER A 6-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION COMPARED WITH A 6-WEEK PRE-INTERVENTION WAIT PERIOD. STUDY RECRUITMENT WAS CHALLENGING WITH A 32% ENROLLMENT RATE; YOGA ATTENDANCE WAS 90%. NONE OF THE SCORES FOR ANXIETY, FATIGUE, SLEEP, AND BALANCE HAD SIGNIFICANT CHANGES DURING THE WAIT PERIOD. AFTER THE 6-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM, CHILDREN (N = 7) HAD A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN ANXIETY SCORE (P = .04) WHILE ADOLESCENT SCORES (N = 7) SHOWED A DECREASING TREND (P = .10). SCORES FOR FATIGUE, SLEEP, AND BALANCE REMAINED STABLE POST-INTERVENTION. FATIGUE AND BALANCE SCORES WERE BELOW NORMS FOR HEALTH CHILDREN/ADOLESCENTS WHILE SLEEP AND ANXIETY SCORES WERE SIMILAR TO HEALTHY PEERS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
15  172  44 A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY OF YOGA SKILLS TRAINING VERSUS AN ATTENTION CONTROL DELIVERED DURING CHEMOTHERAPY ADMINISTRATION. CONTEXT: IT IS IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS FATIGUE AND CO-OCCURRING SYMPTOMS DURING CHEMOTHERAPY TO PRESERVE QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH GASTROINTESTINAL (GI) CANCER. OBJECTIVE: TO CONDUCT A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY OF A YOGA SKILLS TRAINING (YST) INTERVENTION COMPARED TO AN ATTENTION CONTROL (AC) AMONG ADULTS DIAGNOSED WITH GI CANCER. METHODS: YST CONSISTED OF FOUR 30-MINUTE SESSIONS DELIVERED INDIVIDUALLY DURING CHEMOTHERAPY PLUS HOME PRACTICE. AC PROVIDED EMPATHIC ATTENTION PLUS HOME DIARIES. PATIENT-REPORTED (PROMIS T-SCORE) ASSESSMENTS OF FATIGUE, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, SLEEP DISTURBANCES, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS (PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE) WERE COLLECTED AT CHEMOTHERAPY VISITS: BASELINE, WEEK 8, WEEK 10 AND WEEK 14, AND ANALYZED USING A MIXED EFFECTS MODEL. INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND WEEK 10. RESULTS: FORTY-FOUR OF 77 ADULTS APPROACHED AGREED TO PARTICIPATE (57%; YST N = 23; AC N = 21). PARTICIPANTS' MEAN AGE WAS 58 YEARS AND 48% WERE MEN. PARTICIPANTS RANDOMIZED TO YST REPORTED A LARGER DECLINE IN FATIGUE (-2.4 DIFFERENCE, D = 0.30) AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (-2.5 DIFFERENCE, D = 0.30) THAN AC PARTICIPANTS FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 10 AND SLEEP DISTURBANCES AT WEEK 8 (-3.9 DIFFERENCE, D = 0.50). DIFFERENCES IN MAGNITUDE OF CHANGE IN SYMPTOMS WERE CONSISTENT WITH OR EXCEEDED A MINIMALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE. PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS DECREASED MORE IN THE AC AT WEEK 10 (D = 0.30). REDUCTIONS IN INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES (IL-6, STNF R1) WERE LARGER IN THE YST GROUP THAN AC. CONCLUSION: YST SHOWED PROMISE FOR IMPROVING FATIGUE, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, SLEEP DISTURBANCES, AND INFLAMMATION. YST IS ALSO FEASIBLE AND REACHES PATIENTS UNDERREPRESENTED IN YOGA RESEARCH (I.E., GI CANCER, MEN), THUS WARRANTING FURTHER EXAMINATION.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
16 1192  45 EXAMINING A THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS. BACKGROUND: IN THE EARLIER STAGES OF PROSTATE CANCER, EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS HAVE CREATED A NEED FOR RESEARCH TO FOCUS ON PRACTICES THAT MAY IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE THROUGHOUT SURVIVORSHIP. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS A SIGNIFICANT SUPPORTIVE CARE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS, THOUGH THE OPTIMAL MODALITY IS NOT YET UNDERSTOOD. HYPOTHESES: THE AUTHORS HYPOTHESIZED THAT YOGA WOULD BE A FEASIBLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OPTION FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS AND THEIR SUPPORT PERSONS AND THAT THE INCORPORATION OF SOCIAL SUPPORT WOULD INCREASE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ADHERENCE. METHODS: THIS 14-WEEK FEASIBILITY STUDY INVOLVED A 7-WEEK CLASS-BASED YOGA PROGRAM (ADHERENCE PHASE), FOLLOWED BY 7 WEEKS OF SELF-SELECTED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (MAINTENANCE PHASE). DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEHAVIOR, QUALITY OF LIFE, FATIGUE, STRESS, MOOD, AND FITNESS VARIABLES WERE ASSESSED AT 3 TIME POINTS. PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS' PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT WAS RATED DURING YOGA AND AFTER YOGA. RESULTS: CLASS ATTENDANCE WAS 6.1 AND 5.8 FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS (N = 15) AND THEIR SUPPORT PERSONS (N = 10), RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE 7 CLASSES. LEVELS OF PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT WERE HIGHER FOR THOSE WHO BROUGHT A SUPPORT PERSON. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WITH REGARD TO STRESS, FATIGUE, AND MOOD BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA CLASS (ALL PS < .05) WERE REPORTED BY ALL PARTICIPANTS. NO CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE NOTED ON PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVOR'S QUALITY OF LIFE OR FATIGUE OVER THE COURSE OF THE 14-WEEK STUDY. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA IS A FEASIBLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OPTION FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS. THE PROGRAM HAD A PROMISING UPTAKE RATE, HIGH PROGRAM ADHERENCE RATE, AND THERE WERE ACUTE PROGRAM BENEFITS WITH REGARD TO STRESS, FATIGUE, AND MOOD FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS. FUTURE EXAMINATION IS WARRANTED WITH REGARD TO CHRONIC BENEFITS AND GROUP COHESION INFLUENCES ON LEVELS OF PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
17 1118  50 EFFICACY OF AN EIGHT-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION ON SYMPTOMS OF RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS): A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS) IS A COMMON AND HIGHLY BURDENSOME SLEEP DISORDER. WHILE RELAXATION THERAPIES, INCLUDING YOGA, ARE OFTEN RECOMMENDED FOR RLS MANAGEMENT, RIGOROUS SUPPORTING RESEARCH IS SPARSE. THE GOAL OF THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON RLS SYMPTOMS AND RELATED OUTCOMES IN WOMEN WITH RLS. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE 13 NONSMOKING WOMEN WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE RLS, WHO DID NOT HAVE DIABETES, SLEEP APNEA, OR OTHER SERIOUS CONCOMITANT CHRONIC CONDITIONS, AND WHO WERE NOT PREGNANT. THE INTERVENTION WAS A GENTLE, 8-WEEK IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM. CORE OUTCOMES ASSESSED PRE- AND POST-TREATMENT WERE RLS SYMPTOMS AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY (INTERNATIONAL RLS SCALE [IRLS] AND RLS ORDINAL SCALE), SLEEP QUALITY (MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY SLEEP SCALE), MOOD (PROFILE OF MOOD STATES), AND PERCEIVED STRESS (PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE). PARTICIPANTS ALSO COMPLETED YOGA LOGS AND A BRIEF EXIT QUESTIONNAIRE REGARDING THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH THE STUDY. RESULTS: TEN (10) WOMEN, AGED 32-66 YEARS, COMPLETED THE STUDY. PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED AN AVERAGE 13.4+/-0.5 (OF 16 POSSIBLE) CLASSES, AND COMPLETED A MEAN OF 4.1+/-0.3 (OF 5 POSSIBLE) HOMEWORK SESSIONS/WEEK. AT FOLLOW-UP, PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED STRIKING REDUCTIONS IN RLS SYMPTOMS AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY, WITH SYMPTOMS DECREASING TO MINIMAL/MILD IN ALL BUT 1 WOMAN AND NO PARTICIPANT SCORING IN THE SEVERE RANGE BY WEEK 8. EFFECT SIZES (COHEN'S D) WERE LARGE: 1.6 FOR IRLS TOTAL, AND 2.2 FOR RLS ORDINAL SCALE. IRLS SCORES DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH INCREASING MINUTES OF HOMEWORK PRACTICE PER SESSION (R=0.70, P=0.025) AND TOTAL HOMEWORK MINUTES (R=0.64, P<0.05), SUGGESTING A POSSIBLE DOSE-RESPONSE RELATION. PARTICIPANTS ALSO SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN SLEEP, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND MOOD (ALL P'S</=0.02), WITH EFFECT SIZES RANGING FROM 1.0 TO 1.6. CONCLUSIONS: THESE PRELIMINARY FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN ATTENUATING RLS SYMPTOMS AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY, REDUCING PERCEIVED STRESS, AND IMPROVING SLEEP AND MOOD IN WOMEN WITH RLS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                  
18 2769  33 YOGA REDUCES PERCEIVED STRESS AND EXHAUSTION LEVELS IN HEALTHY ELDERLY INDIVIDUALS. UNLABELLED: THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED WHETHER A 7-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION COULD IMPROVE PHYSICAL FUNCTION, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND MENTAL/EMOTIONAL WELLNESS IN ELDERLY PARTICIPANTS. METHODS: 8 PARTICIPANTS (66.5 +/- 0.3 YEARS) ATTENDED 2 60-MIN HATHA YOGA SESSIONS/WEEK FOR 7 WEEKS, AND PERFORMED PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION ASSESSMENTS. BALANCE WAS ASSESSED USING A 5-TEST BATTERY. FLEXIBILITY WAS MEASURED BY SIT-AND-REACH AND SHOULDER FLEXIBILITY TESTS. FUNCTIONAL MOBILITY TESTS INCLUDED 8-FT UP-AND-GO, 5 CHAIR STANDS, AND 4-M WALK. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED SF-12, EXHAUSTION LEVEL, AND PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE (PSS) QUESTIONNAIRES. RESULTS: SF-12 MENTAL COMPONENT SUMMARY SCORES, EXHAUSTION LEVELS, AND PSS SCORES IMPROVED POST-INTERVENTION. NO DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND FOR PHYSICAL FUNCTION MEASURES. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA PARTICIPATION CAN IMPROVE MENTAL/EMOTIONAL WELLNESS, EXHAUSTION LEVELS, AND STRESS LEVELS IN ELDERLY INDIVIDUALS, EVEN WITHOUT MEASURABLE IMPROVEMENTS IN PHYSICAL FUNCTION. CLINICIANS AND HEALTH PRACTITIONERS WHO WORK WITH THE ELDERLY SHOULD CONSIDER YOGA AS A POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC MODALITY FOR IMPROVING IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF QUALITY OF LIFE IN THIS POPULATION.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
19  117  39 A PILOT STUDY OF GENTLE YOGA FOR SLEEP DISTURBANCE IN WOMEN WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS. OBJECTIVES: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO TEST THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF A GENTLE YOGA INTERVENTION FOR SLEEP DISTURBANCE IN OLDER WOMEN WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) AND TO COLLECT INITIAL EFFICACY DATA ON THE INTERVENTION. METHODS: ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED AN 8-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM THAT INCLUDED 75-MIN WEEKLY CLASSES AND 20 MIN OF NIGHTLY HOME PRACTICE. PARTICIPANTS WERE WOMEN WITH OA AND SYMPTOMS CONSISTENT WITH INSOMNIA. SYMPTOM QUESTIONNAIRES AND 1 WEEK OF WRIST ACTIGRAPHY AND SLEEP DIARIES WERE COMPLETED FOR 1 WEEK PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION. RESULTS: FOURTEEN WOMEN WERE ENROLLED OF WHOM 13 COMPLETED THE STUDY (MEAN AGE 65.2 +/- 6.9 YEARS). PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED A MEAN OF 7.2 +/- 1.0 CLASSES AND PRACTICED AT HOME 5.83 +/- 1.66 NIGHTS/WEEK. THE INSOMNIA SEVERITY INDEX AND DIARY-REPORTED SLEEP ONSET LATENCY, SLEEP EFFICIENCY, AND NUMBER OF NIGHTS WITH INSOMNIA WERE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED AT POST-INTERVENTION VERSUS PRE-INTERVENTION (P < .05). OTHER SLEEP OUTCOMES (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX, EPWORTH SLEEPINESS SCALE, DIARY-REPORTED TOTAL SLEEP TIME AND WAKE AFTER SLEEP ONSET) SHOWED IMPROVEMENT ON MEAN SCORES AT POST-INTERVENTION, BUT THESE WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. ACTIGRAPHIC SLEEP OUTCOMES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY SUPPORTS THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF A STANDARDIZED EVENING YOGA PRACTICE FOR MIDDLE-AGED TO OLDER WOMEN WITH OA. PRELIMINARY EFFICACY FINDINGS SUPPORT FURTHER RESEARCH ON THIS PROGRAM AS A POTENTIAL TREATMENT OPTION FOR OA-RELATED INSOMNIA.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
20  294  33 AFFECT AND MINDFULNESS AS PREDICTORS OF CHANGE IN MOOD DISTURBANCE, STRESS SYMPTOMS, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN A COMMUNITY-BASED YOGA PROGRAM FOR CANCER SURVIVORS. LITTLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID TO THE PSYCHOLOGICAL DETERMINANTS BY WHICH BENEFITS ARE ACCRUED VIA YOGA PRACTICE IN CANCER-RELATED CLINICAL SETTINGS. USING A LONGITUDINAL MULTILEVEL MODELING APPROACH, ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN AFFECT, MINDFULNESS, AND PATIENT-REPORTED MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES, INCLUDING MOOD DISTURBANCE, STRESS SYMPTOMS, AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQL), WERE EXAMINED IN AN EXISTING SEVEN-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM FOR CANCER SURVIVORS. PARTICIPANTS (N = 66) WERE ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER THE YOGA PROGRAM AND AT THREE- AND SIX-MONTH FOLLOW-UPS. DECREASES IN MOOD DISTURBANCE AND STRESS SYMPTOMS AND IMPROVEMENTS IN HRQL WERE OBSERVED UPON PROGRAM COMPLETION. IMPROVEMENTS IN MOOD DISTURBANCE AND STRESS SYMPTOMS WERE MAINTAINED AT THE THREE- AND SIX-MONTH FOLLOW-UPS. HRQL EXHIBITED FURTHER IMPROVEMENT AT THE THREE-MONTH FOLLOW-UP, WHICH WAS MAINTAINED AT THE SIX-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. IMPROVEMENTS IN MEASURES OF WELL-BEING WERE PREDICTED BY INITIAL POSITIVE YOGA BELIEFS AND CONCURRENTLY ASSESSED AFFECTIVE AND MINDFULNESS PREDICTOR VARIABLES. PREVIOUS YOGA EXPERIENCE, AFFECT, MINDFULNESS, AND HRQL WERE RELATED TO YOGA PRACTICE MAINTENANCE OVER THE COURSE OF THE STUDY.	2013

1 2216 123 THE IMPACT OF A DAILY YOGA PROGRAM FOR WOMEN WITH FIBROMYALGIA. BACKGROUND: FIBROMYALGIA (FM) IS CHARACTERIZED BY WIDESPREAD PAIN, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, NEGATIVE AFFECT, AND STRESS AND IS NOTABLY DIFFICULT TO TREAT. INDIVIDUALS WITH FM HAVE LOWER PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND ENDORSE FEARS THAT EXERCISE MAY WORSEN PAIN. GENTLE DAILY YOGA PRACTICE MAY ALLOW A GRADUAL INCREASE IN ACTIVITY AND POSITIVELY IMPACT MANY OF THESE FM SYMPTOMS. THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY INVESTIGATED THE IMPACT OF PARTICIPATION IN A PILOT TRIAL OF GROUP AND DAILY INDIVIDUAL HOME YOGA INTERVENTION ON WOMEN WITH FM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FIFTEEN INDIVIDUALS PARTICIPATED IN TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS AFTER PARTICIPATING IN THE YOGA INTERVENTION, WHICH INCLUDED SEMI-STRUCTURED QUESTIONS TO ELICIT INSIGHTS AND IMPRESSIONS OF THEIR EXPERIENCE. RESPONSES WERE SYSTEMATICALLY CODED AND THEMES IDENTIFIED. RESULTS: FIVE THEMES WERE IDENTIFIED: (1) PHYSICAL/BODY PERCEPTUAL CHANGES, (2) PRACTICES AFFECTING PAIN, (3) EMOTIONAL CHANGES, (4) PRACTICE MOTIVATORS AND BARRIERS, AND (5) GROUP EFFECT. PARTICIPANTS NOT ONLY REPORTED REDUCTIONS IN FM SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING PAIN AND STRESS, BUT ALSO A POSITIVE IMPACT ON MOOD, SLEEP, AND SELF-CONFIDENCE. CONCLUSIONS: PARTICIPANTS ENUMERATED BOTH PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF STARTING YOGA PRACTICE. SPECIFIC HELPFUL POSES AND PRACTICES AND IMPORTANT BARRIERS WERE IDENTIFIED. GROUP PRACTICE AND SOCIAL CONNECTION WITH OTHERS WITH OTHER FM PATIENTS WAS AN IMPORTANT BENEFIT TO PARTICIPANTS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
2  108  37 A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF THE YOGA OF AWARENESS PROGRAM IN THE MANAGEMENT OF FIBROMYALGIA. A MOUNTING BODY OF LITERATURE RECOMMENDS THAT TREATMENT FOR FIBROMYALGIA (FM) ENCOMPASS MEDICATIONS, EXERCISE AND IMPROVEMENT OF COPING SKILLS. HOWEVER, THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT GAP IN DETERMINING AN EFFECTIVE COUNTERPART TO PHARMACOTHERAPY THAT INCORPORATES BOTH EXERCISE AND COPING. THE AIM OF THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF A COMPREHENSIVE YOGA INTERVENTION ON FM SYMPTOMS AND COPING. A SAMPLE OF 53 FEMALE FM PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO THE 8-WEEK YOGA OF AWARENESS PROGRAM (GENTLE POSES, MEDITATION, BREATHING EXERCISES, YOGA-BASED COPING INSTRUCTIONS, GROUP DISCUSSIONS) OR TO WAIT-LISTED STANDARD CARE. DATA WERE ANALYZED BY INTENTION TO TREAT. AT POST-TREATMENT, WOMEN ASSIGNED TO THE YOGA PROGRAM SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENTS ON STANDARDIZED MEASURES OF FM SYMPTOMS AND FUNCTIONING, INCLUDING PAIN, FATIGUE, AND MOOD, AND IN PAIN CATASTROPHIZING, ACCEPTANCE, AND OTHER COPING STRATEGIES. THIS PILOT STUDY PROVIDES PROMISING SUPPORT FOR THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF A YOGA PROGRAM FOR WOMEN WITH FM.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
3  142  31 A PROTOCOL AND PILOT STUDY FOR MANAGING FIBROMYALGIA WITH YOGA AND MEDITATION. FIBROMYALGIA IS A CHRONIC SYNDROME CHARACTERIZED BY WIDESPREAD PAIN, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, STIFFNESS, FATIGUE, HEADACHE, AND MOOD DISORDERS. RECENT RESEARCH HAS RESULTED IN AN IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF FIBROMYALGIA AND ITS POSSIBLE CAUSES. THIS ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THE CURRENT RESEARCH, DISCUSSES A STRATEGY FOR USING YOGA AND MEDITATION AS A THERAPY FOR FIBROMYALGIA SUFFERERS, AND PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A PRELIMINARY 8-WEEK STUDY USING YOGA AND MEDITATION TO HELP MANAGE FIBROMYALGIA SYMPTOMS. THE STUDY OF 11 PARTICIPANTS FOUND SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE OVERALL HEALTH STATUS OF THE PARTICIPANTS AND IN SYMPTOMS OF STIFFNESS, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE ALSO SEEN IN THE REPORTED NUMBER OF DAYS "FELT GOOD" AND NUMBER OF DAYS "MISSED WORK" BECAUSE OF FIBROMYALGIA. NONSIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE SEEN IN MEASURES OF PAIN, FATIGUE, AND HOW ONE FELT IN THE MORNING. EFFECT SIZES WERE MEDIUM TO LARGE FOR MOST TESTED AREAS. THIS STUDY SUPPORTS THE BENEFITS OF YOGA AND MEDITATION FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH FIBROMYALGIA AND ENCOURAGES FURTHER RESEARCH TO EXPLORE THEIR USE AS STANDARD THERAPIES FOR FIBROMYALGIA.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
4 1375  56 IMPACT OF DAILY YOGA-BASED EXERCISE ON PAIN, CATASTROPHIZING, AND SLEEP AMONGST INDIVIDUALS WITH FIBROMYALGIA. BACKGROUND: FIBROMYALGIA (FM) IS A CHRONIC WIDESPREAD PAIN DISORDER CHARACTERIZED BY NEGATIVE AFFECT, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, AND FATIGUE. THIS UNCONTROLLED PILOT STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFICACY OF DAILY YOGA-BASED EXERCISE TO IMPROVE FM SYMPTOMS AND EXPLORED BASELINE PHENOTYPIC CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH THE GREATEST BENEFIT. METHODS: FM PATIENTS (N=46, WITH 36 COMPLETERS) REPORTED PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING AND A RANGE OF FM SYMPTOMS USING VALIDATED INSTRUMENTS BEFORE AND AFTER PARTICIPATION IN SATYANANDA YOGA, WHICH INCLUDED WEEKLY IN-PERSON PAIN-TAILORED GROUP CLASSES FOR 6 WEEKS AND DAILY HOME YOGA VIDEO PRACTICE. RESULTS: CHANGES IN FM SYMPTOMS FROM PRE- TO POST-YOGA WERE VARIABLE AMONGST PARTICIPANTS. GROUP MEANS FOR PAIN DECREASED, AS REPORTED BY AVERAGE DAILY DIARY AND BRIEF PAIN INVENTORY, WITH GREATER HOME PRACTICE MINUTES ASSOCIATED WITH A GREATER DECREASE IN PAIN. AVERAGE DAILY RATINGS OF SLEEP AND FATIGUE IMPROVED. PAIN CATASTROPHIZING WAS DECREASED OVERALL, WITH GREATER CHANGE CORRELATED TO A DECREASE IN FM SYMPTOMS. WE DID NOT OBSERVE ANY GROUP MEAN CHANGES IN ACTIGRAPHY SLEEP EFFICIENCY, PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES MEASUREMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM-ANXIETY AND THE REVISED FIBROMYALGIA IMPACT QUESTIONNAIRE. MULTILEVEL MODELING ANALYSIS REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION BETWEEN ANXIETY AND CATASTROPHIZING FOR END-STUDY SLEEP EFFICIENCY, FATIGUE, AND PAIN, SUCH THAT PATIENTS WITH HIGHER BASELINE CATASTROPHIZING AND LOWER BASELINE ANXIETY REPORTED LESS PAIN AND FATIGUE, AND HIGHER SLEEP EFFICIENCY AFTER THE SIXTH WEEK OF YOGA PRACTICE. CONCLUSION: THIS PILOT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT YOGA MAY REDUCE PAIN AND CATASTROPHIZING, AS WELL AS IMPROVE SLEEP, BUT THESE CHANGES WERE MODEST ACROSS STUDY PARTICIPANTS. GREATER UPTAKE OF HOME YOGA PRACTICE AS WELL AS A PHENOTYPE OF HIGHER BASELINE CATASTROPHIZING COMBINED WITH LOWER BASELINE ANXIETY WERE ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER IMPACT. FUTURE RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIALS COMPARING DIFFERENT TYPES OF YOGA OR EXERCISE WILL ALLOW DETERMINATION OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS FOR FM AND ALLOW CLOSER TARGETING TO THE PATIENTS WHO WILL BENEFIT MOST FROM THEM.	2019	
                              
5   87  49 A MIXED METHODS EVALUATION OF AN INDIVIDUALISED YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS: PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVES: TO EXPLORE PATIENTS' EXPERIENCES OF AN INDIVIDUALISED YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA), SPECIFICALLY IN TERMS OF ITS ACCEPTABILITY AND IMPACT ON PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES. DESIGN: TEN PATIENTS TOOK PART IN A 16 WEEK YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION IN A HOSPITAL SETTING, CONSISTING OF 10 ONE-TO-ONE CONSULTATIONS WITH A YOGA THERAPIST FOLLOWED BY TWO GROUP REVIEW SESSIONS. CHANGES IN HEALTH (EQ-5D, HADS) WERE ASSESSED PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION AND AT 12-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED POST-INTERVENTION AND ANALYSED USING THEMATIC ANALYSIS. RESULTS: ATTENDANCE OF THE 1-TO-1 SESSIONS WAS HIGH (98 %) AND ALL PARTICIPANTS REPORTED STRONG COMMITMENT TO THEIR PERSONALISED HOME PRACTICE. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN MEASURES OF DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, PAIN, QUALITY OF LIFE AND GENERAL HEALTH AT POST-INTERVENTION AND 12-MONTHS (P < 0.05). IN INTERVIEWS, ALL BUT ONE PARTICIPANT REPORTED POSITIVE CHANGES TO THEIR SYMPTOMS AND SEVERAL REPORTED REDUCTIONS IN THEIR MEDICATION AND BROADER BENEFITS SUCH AS IMPROVED SLEEP, MOOD AND ENERGY, ENABLING RE-ENGAGEMENT WITH LIFE. THE PERSONALLY TAILORED NATURE OF THE PRACTICE AND PERCEIVED BENEFITS WERE KEY MOTIVATIONAL FACTORS. PARTICULAR VALUE WAS PLACED ON THE THERAPEUTIC FUNCTION OF THE CONSULTATION AND PROVISION OF TOOLS TO MANAGE STRESS AND BUILD RESILIENCE. CONCLUSION: THIS YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION WAS POSITIVELY RECEIVED BY PATIENTS WITH RA, WITH HIGH LEVELS OF ADHERENCE TO BOTH THE TREATMENTS AND TAILORED HOME PRACTICE. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA THERAPY HAS POTENTIAL AS AN ADJUNCT THERAPY TO IMPROVE RA SYMPTOMS, INCREASE SELF-CARE BEHAVIOURS AND MANAGE STRESS AND NEGATIVE AFFECT SUCH AS ANXIETY. A LARGER MULTI-CENTRE STUDY IS THEREFORE WARRANTED.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
6 1723  41 PERCEPTIONS OF HATHA YOGA AMONGST PERSISTENTLY DEPRESSED INDIVIDUALS ENROLLED IN A TRIAL OF YOGA FOR DEPRESSION. OBJECTIVES: TO UNDERSTAND DEPRESSED INDIVIDUALS' EXPERIENCES IN A 10-WEEK HATHA YOGA PROGRAM. DESIGN: IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSIGNED TO EITHER 10 WEEKS OF HATHA YOGA CLASSES OR A HEALTH EDUCATION CONTROL GROUP. THIS REPORT INCLUDES RESPONSES FROM PARTICIPANTS IN YOGA CLASSES. AT THE START OF CLASSES, AVERAGE DEPRESSION SYMPTOM SEVERITY LEVEL WAS MODERATE. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: AFTER 10 WEEKS OF YOGA CLASSES, WE ASKED PARTICIPANTS (N=50) TO PROVIDE WRITTEN RESPONSES TO OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THEY LIKED ABOUT CLASSES, WHAT THEY DID NOT LIKE OR DID NOT FIND HELPFUL, AND WHAT THEY LEARNED. WE ANALYZED QUALITATIVE DATA USING THEMATIC ANALYSIS. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: ELEMENTS OF YOGA CLASSES THAT MAY INCREASE ACCEPTABILITY FOR DEPRESSED INDIVIDUALS INCLUDE HAVING INSTRUCTORS WHO PROMOTE A NON-COMPETITIVE AND NON-JUDGMENTAL ATMOSPHERE, WHO ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE AND ABLE TO PROVIDE INDIVIDUALIZED ATTENTION, AND WHO ARE KIND AND WARM. INCLUDING DEPRESSION-RELATED THEMES IN CLASSES, TEACHING MINDFULNESS, TEACHING BREATHING EXERCISES, AND PROVIDING GUIDANCE FOR TRANSLATING CLASS INTO HOME PRACTICE MAY HELP TO MAKE YOGA EFFECTIVE FOR TARGETING DEPRESSION. PARTICIPANTS' COMMENTS REINFORCED THE IMPORTANCE OF ASPECTS OF MINDFULNESS, SUCH AS ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT MOMENT AND ACCEPTANCE OF ONE'S SELF AND ONE'S EXPERIENCE, AS POTENTIAL MECHANISMS OF ACTION. OTHER POTENTIAL MECHANISMS INCLUDE USE OF BREATHING PRACTICES IN EVERYDAY LIFE AND THE BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS THAT UNDERLIE THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF YOGIC BREATHING. THE MOST SERIOUS CONCERN HIGHLIGHTED BY A FEW PARTICIPANTS WAS THE CONCERN THAT THE YOGA CLASSES WERE TOO DIFFICULT GIVEN THEIR PHYSICAL ABILITIES.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
7 1373  40 IMPACT OF A YOGA INTERVENTION ON PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, SELF-EFFICACY, AND MOTIVATION IN WOMEN WITH PTSD SYMPTOMS. BACKGROUND: STUDIES USING YOGA HAVE DEMONSTRATED INITIAL EFFICACY FOR TREATING SYMPTOMS ACROSS ANXIETY DISORDERS, INCLUDING POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. OBJECTIVE: UNDERSTANDING HOW INTERVENTIONS INFLUENCE PARTICIPANTS' PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND WHAT DETERMINANTS AFFECT CONTINUED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEHAVIOR CHANGE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE MAINTENANCE OF THE BEHAVIOR MAY BE CRITICAL TO CONTINUED MENTAL HEALTH GAINS AND SYMPTOM REDUCTION. METHODS: THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED CHANGE IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND POSSIBLE PSYCHOLOGICAL MECHANISMS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEHAVIOR CHANGE, INCLUDING SELF-EFFICACY AND REGULATORY MOTIVATION, IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA FOR WOMEN WITH POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER SYMPTOMS (N=38). RESULTS: GROWTH CURVE MODELING RESULTS SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OR SELF-EFFICACY FOR EITHER GROUP, WHEREAS EXTERNAL MOTIVATION DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE YOGA GROUP BUT NOT IN THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: INVESTIGATORS OF FUTURE YOGA INTERVENTIONS MAY WANT TO FOCUS ON INCREASING SELF-EFFICACY AND INTERNAL REGULATORY MOTIVATION, SO THAT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND RESULTANT SYMPTOM RELIEF CAN BE MAINTAINED.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
8 1684  32 OPEN TRIAL OF VINYASA YOGA FOR PERSISTENTLY DEPRESSED INDIVIDUALS: EVIDENCE OF FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF VINYASA YOGA AS AN ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSED PATIENTS WHO WERE NOT RESPONDING ADEQUATELY TO ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATION. THE AUTHORS ALSO PLANNED TO ASK PARTICIPANTS FOR QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK ON THEIR EXPERIENCE OF THE CLASS AND TO ASSESS CHANGE OVER TIME IN DEPRESSION AND IN POSSIBLE MEDIATING VARIABLES. THE AUTHORS RECRUITED 11 PARTICIPANTS IN 1 MONTH FOR AN 8-WEEK OPEN TRIAL OF YOGA CLASSES. THEY FOUND THAT 10 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENTS, 9 OF 10 WERE POSITIVE ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE, AND ALL PROVIDED FEEDBACK ABOUT WHAT WAS AND WAS NOT HELPFUL ABOUT YOGA, AS WELL AS BARRIERS TO CLASS ATTENDANCE. OVER THE 2-MONTH PERIOD, PARTICIPANTS EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN AN ASPECT OF MINDFULNESS AND IN BEHAVIOR ACTIVATION. THIS PILOT STUDY PROVIDED SUPPORT FOR CONTINUING TO INVESTIGATE VINYASA YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION. THE NEXT STEP REQUIRED IS A RIGOROUS RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
9 2903  32 [HOW SHOULD YOGA IN ANOREXIA NERVOSA TREATMENT BE APPLIED? A QUALITATIVE PILOT STUDY ON YOGA STRATEGIES PERCEIVED TO BE BENEFICIAL FROM PATIENTS' PERSPECTIVE]. AN ALTERED INTEROCEPTION IS A CENTRAL CORRELATE OF ANOREXIA NERVOSA (AN) AND ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE OFFERS A PROMISING APPROACH IN THE TREATMENT OF AN. FIRST RESULTS HAVE SHOWN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AS A BODY-FOCUSED INTERVENTION IN THE TREATMENT OF AN. HOWEVER, TO DATE THERE IS A LACK OF EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE REGARDING THE QUESTION HOW YOGA STRATEGIES AND YOGA ELEMENTS (POSTURES, RELAXATION, BREATH, MEDITATION) SHOULD BE APPLIED. AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND, WE CONDUCTED A QUALITATIVE PILOT STUDY WITH N=6 FEMALE PATIENTS WITH AN UNDERGOING TREATMENT IN A SPECIALIST UNIT SUPPORTING RE-INSERTION SUBSEQUENT TO A PRECEDING INPATIENT AN TREATMENT. STUDY PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED A WEEKLY ONE-HOUR HATHA-YOGA INTERVENTION OVER AT LEAST 12 WEEKS. AFTER THE YOGA INTERVENTION, SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS (1/2 TO 1 HOUR) WERE CONDUCTED TO ASSESS THE EXPERIENCES OF THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS DURING THE YOGA INTERVENTION. THE DATA WERE ANALYZED USING GROUNDED THEORY. AT THE UPPER LEVEL OF ANALYSIS, FOUR CATEGORIES WERE DIFFERENTIATED: INFORMATION REGARDING 1) STUDY PARTICIPANTS' SYMPTOMS, 2) ASPECTS OF THE SETTING EXPERIENCED TO BE BENEFICIAL, 3) YOGA STRATEGIES PERCEIVED TO BE BENEFICIAL AND 4) PERCEIVED CONSEQUENCES OF YOGA STRATEGIES. WITH REGARD TO THE YOGA STRATEGIES PERCEIVED TO BE BENEFICIAL, ANALYSES REVEALED 4 SUBCATEGORIES: FEATURES OF 1) POSTURES AND MOVEMENTS, 2) BREATH AND MEDITATION EXERCISES, 3) RELAXATION EXERCISES AND 4) GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE SETTING. THE RESULTS GIVE FIRST INDICATIONS REGARDING THE CONCEPTUALIZATION OF YOGA IN THE TREATMENT OF AN AND POTENTIAL MECHANISMS. FURTHER QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE STUDIES ARE NEEDED, E.G., WITH REGARD TO EFFECTIVENESS, CONTRAINDICATIONS, MEDIATORS OR MODERATORS TO BETTER EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL OF YOGA IN THE TREATMENT OF AN.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
10 2695  34 YOGA INFLUENCES RECOVERY DURING INPATIENT REHABILITATION: A PILOT STUDY. PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ADD YOGA THERAPY TO INPATIENT REHABILITATION AND ASSESS WHETHER PATIENTS CHOSE TO ENGAGE IN YOGA THERAPY IN ADDITION TO OTHER DAILY THERAPIES, TO DESCRIBE PATIENTS' PERCEPTIONS OF HOW YOGA THERAPY INFLUENCED RECOVERY, AND TO ASSESS AND DESCRIBE PATIENT SATISFACTION WITH THE PROGRAM. METHODS: THIS WAS A SINGLE-ARM PILOT STUDY, ADDING YOGA THERAPY TO ONGOING INPATIENT REHABILITATION. YOGA THERAPY WAS OFFERED AS GROUP YOGA OR INDIVIDUAL YOGA TWICE A WEEK. SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW QUESTIONS WERE COMPLETED VIA TELEPHONE POST-DISCHARGE. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 55 OF THE 77 (71%) PEOPLE CONTACTED ABOUT THE STUDY ENGAGED IN YOGA THERAPY IN THE INPATIENT REHABILITATION SETTING FOR THIS STUDY AND 31 (56%) OF THESE COMPLETED THE SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW QUESTIONS. QUALITATIVE DATA SUPPORT THAT PARTICIPANTS PERCEIVED THAT YOGA THERAPY IMPROVED BREATHING, RELAXATION, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING. OVERALL, PARTICIPANTS WERE SATISFIED WITH THE PROGRAM, ALTHOUGH THEY OFTEN INDICATED THEY WOULD LIKE INCREASED FLEXIBILITY OR FREQUENCY OF YOGA. ALMOST ALL PARTICIPANTS (97%) SAID THEY WOULD RECOMMEND THE YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM TO OTHERS IN INPATIENT REHABILITATION. CONCLUSION: WE WERE ABLE TO ADD YOGA THERAPY TO ONGOING INPATIENT REHABILITATION AND PARTICIPANTS PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF HAVING THE YOGA THERAPY IN THEIR REHABILITATION STAY.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
11 2385  45 YOGA ADHERENCE IN OLDER WOMEN SIX MONTHS POST-OSTEOARTHRITIS INTERVENTION. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) IS A HIGHLY PREVALENT CONDITION WORLDWIDE. YOGA IS POTENTIALLY A SAFE AND FEASIBLE OPTION FOR MANAGING OA; HOWEVER, THE EXTENT OF LONG-TERM YOGA ADHERENCE IS UNKNOWN. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE YOGA ADHERENCE 6 MONTHS AFTER PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED AN OA INTERVENTION PROGRAM. METHODS: THIS FOLLOW-UP STUDY EMPLOYED A CROSS-SECTIONAL DESCRIPTIVE DESIGN USING SURVEY, INTERVIEW, AND VIDEO RECORDINGS TO COLLECT BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA. A TOTAL OF 31 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED AND RETURNED THE SURVEY, AND 10 VIDEOTAPED THEIR YOGA PRACTICE FOR 1 WEEK AND PARTICIPATED IN A FACE-TO-FACE INTERVIEW. RESULTS: A MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS (N=19, 61%) REPORTED THAT THEY WERE STILL PRACTICING YOGA 6 MONTHS AFTER THE INTERVENTION PROGRAM. ON AVERAGE, PARTICIPANTS REPORTED PRACTICING 21 TO 30 MINUTES OF YOGA PER DAY (32%) 3 TO 4 DAYS PER WEEK (47%). "FEELING GOOD OR FEELING BETTER AFTER YOGA PRACTICE" (50%) AND "SET ASIDE A TIME" (31%) WERE THE MOST COMMON MOTIVATING FACTORS FOR YOGA ADHERENCE. DEALING WITH HEALTH PROBLEMS (42%), HAVING PAIN (25%), AND BEING TOO BUSY (25%) WERE THE MAJOR BARRIERS. QUALITATIVE DATA REVEALED THAT PARTICIPANTS: (1) USED MINDFUL YOGA MOVEMENT, (2) INCORPORATED OTHER FORMS OF EXERCISE AND RESOURCES DURING YOGA PRACTICE, AND (3) CREATED PERSONALIZED YOGA PROGRAMS. ADDITIONALLY, THE PARTICIPANTS REPORTED LESS OA PAIN, INCREASED PHYSICAL ENDURANCE, AND MORE RELAXATION. CONCLUSION: MANY PARTICIPANTS ADHERED TO YOGA PRACTICE 6 MONTHS POST-INTERVENTION ALTHOUGH NOT AT THE FREQUENCY AND SEQUENCE AS PRESCRIBED. FEELING BETTER AFTER PRACTICE MOTIVATED PARTICIPANTS, BUT OTHER FACTORS REMAINED KEY BARRIERS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
12 2249  33 THE LIVED EXPERIENCE AND PATIENT-REPORTED BENEFITS OF YOGA PARTICIPATION IN AN INPATIENT BRAIN INJURY REHABILITATION SETTING. CONTEXT: THE MULTIFACTORIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA HAVE BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED IN THE LITERATURE, WITH THE INTEGRATION OF YOGA THERAPY INTO HEALTHCARE BEING AN EMERGING FIELD. IN GENERAL, YOGA THERAPY PROGRAMS ARE UTILIZED IN THE COMMUNITY AS AN ADJUNCT TO OTHER THERAPY. AT PRESENT, LIMITED REHABILITATION UNITS ROUTINELY INCORPORATE INTEGRATIVE THERAPY OPTIONS WITHIN A HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT. AIMS: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXPLORE THE LIVED EXPERIENCE AND PATIENT-REPORTED BENEFITS OF YOGA IN AN INPATIENT BRAIN INJURY REHABILITATION SETTING. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: THIRTY-ONE PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED TO THE STUDY AFTER VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATING IN A YOGA CLASS WITHIN AN INPATIENT BRAIN INJURY REHABILITATION UNIT OF A MAJOR METROPOLITAN HOSPITAL. YOGA SESSIONS WERE HELD WEEKLY FOR 60 MIN AND CONSISTED OF A MODIFIED HATHA YOGA STYLE. THIS WAS A MIXED-METHODS, QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL ONE-GROUP PRETEST-POSTTEST STUDY. METHODOLOGY: QUANTITATIVE DATA WERE COLLECTED TO MEASURE PERCEPTIONS OF RELAXATION AND WELL-BEING BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA CLASSES, ALONG WITH THE SATISFACTION OF THE CLASS. SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE UTILIZED TO COLLECT QUALITATIVE DATA OF EXPERIENCES AND PERCEPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA PARTICIPATION. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: THEMATIC ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETED FOR QUALITATIVE DATA. QUANTITATIVE DATA WERE ANALYZED USING NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICAL METHODS, AND DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS WERE ALSO PROVIDED. RESULTS: THE BENEFITS DESCRIBED BY PARTICIPANTS ARE REPORTED IN THIS PAPER. THESE INCLUDE IMPROVED RELAXATION, PHYSICAL WELL-BEING, EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING, BEING PRESENT, AND SELF-AWARENESS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY DESCRIBES THE PERSONAL BENEFITS EXPERIENCED FROM REGULAR YOGA PARTICIPATION WITHIN AN INPATIENT REHABILITATION SETTING.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
13 1628  27 MINDFULNESS, SELF-COMPASSION, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION MEASURES IN SOUTH AUSTRALIAN YOGA PARTICIPANTS: IMPLICATIONS FOR DESIGNING A YOGA INTERVENTION. AIM: THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE DEMOGRAPHIC AND PRACTICE CHARACTERISTICS OF CURRENT YOGA PARTICIPANTS AND ASSESS THEIR LEVELS OF MINDFULNESS, SELF-COMPASSION, STRESS, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND WELLBEING AND IMPLICATIONS FOR DESIGNING A YOGA INTERVENTION. METHODS: A WEB-BASED SURVEY WAS ADMINISTERED TO SOUTH AUSTRALIAN YOGA TEACHERS AND STUDENTS FROM SEPTEMBER 2014 TO FEBRUARY 2015. RESULTS: RESULTS SHOWED A POSITIVE CORRELATION WITH MINDFULNESS AND SELF-COMPASSION AND NEGATIVE CORRELATION WITH DEPRESSION, ANXIETY AND STRESS SCORES WITH MONTHS OF PRACTICE. MINDFULNESS AND SELF-COMPASSION SCORES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER WITH TWO OR MORE CLASSES PER WEEK AND MINDFULNESS HIGHER IN THOSE WITH A REGULAR MEDITATION PRACTICE. DISCUSSION: KEY FINDINGS INDICATE THAT CLASS FREQUENCY, PRACTICE EXPERIENCE AND MEDITATION PRACTICE ARE IMPORTANT FACTORS IN DESIGNING A YOGA INTERVENTION EXAMINING MINDFULNESS AND MENTAL HEALTH. CONCLUSION: FINDINGS PROVIDE IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR GUIDING DEVELOPMENT OF A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
14   14  36 "NOW I SEE A BRIGHTER DAY": EXPECTATIONS AND PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF AN IYENGAR YOGA INTERVENTION FOR YOUNG PATIENTS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA) IS A CHRONIC DISEASE CHARACTERIZED BY INFLAMMATION OF JOINTS AND ASSOCIATED FATIGUE, DETERIORATED RANGE OF MOTION, AND IMPAIRED PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING. YOUNG ADULTS WITH RA ARE AT A PARTICULAR RISK FOR COMPROMISED HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, AND THERE IS A NEED FOR SAFE, EFFECTIVE COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT IN ADDITION TO TRADITIONAL MEDICAL APPROACHES. THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO USE FACE-TO-FACE PARTICIPANT INTERVIEWS, CONDUCTED BEFORE AND AFTER AN IYENGAR YOGA (IY) PROGRAM, TO EXAMINE MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH YOGA MAY BE BENEFICIAL TO YOUNG ADULTS WITH RA.THIS PILOT STUDY UTILIZED A SINGLE-ARM DESIGN WHERE ALL PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED THE INTERVENTION. CLASSES WERE TAUGHT TWICE PER WEEK (1.5 HOURS EACH) FOR 6 WEEKS BY AN IY TEACHER QUALIFIED IN THERAPEUTICS. INTERVIEW THEMES INCLUDED PARTICIPANTS' BASELINE EXPECTATIONS ABOUT YOGA AND VIEWPOINTS AS TO HOW THEIR FUNCTIONING HAD BEEN IMPACTED BY THE IY INTERVENTION WERE EXAMINED. FIVE YOUNG ADULTS WITH RA AGED 24-31 YEARS (MEAN = 28; 80% FEMALE) COMPLETED THE YOGA INTERVENTION. PARTICIPANTS CONSISTENTLY REPORTED THAT YOGA HELPED WITH ENERGY, RELAXATION AND MOOD AND THEY DISCUSSED PERCEIVED MECHANISMS FOR HOW YOGA IMPACTED WELL-BEING. MECHANISMS INCLUDED PHYSICAL CHANGES SUCH AS RANGE OF MOTION AND PHYSIOLOGICAL AWARENESS, AND PSYCHOSPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENTS SUCH AS ACCEPTANCE, COPING, SELF-EFFICACY AND MINDFULNESS. THOUGH THE STUDY IS LIMITED, PARTICIPANTS' RESPONSES PROVIDE COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT IY FOR RA PATIENTS IS AN INTERVENTION WORTHY OF FURTHER EXPLORATION. THE MECHANISMS AND OUTCOMES REPORTED BY PARTICIPANTS SUPPORT A BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL MODEL, WHICH PROPOSES THAT YOGA BENEFITS PATIENTS THROUGH BOTH PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOSPIRITUAL CHANGES.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
15 2563  38 YOGA FOR CHRONIC PAIN MANAGEMENT: A QUALITATIVE EXPLORATION. OBJECTIVE: TO EXPLORE PATIENTS' PERCEPTIONS OF THEIR PAIN WHILE PARTICIPATING IN A WEEKLY YOGA PROGRAM. METHODS: A CONSECUTIVE CONVENIENCE SAMPLE WAS RECRUITED FROM A MULTIDISCIPLINARY PAIN CENTRE. SEVEN ADULT PATIENTS (SIX WOMEN), AGREED TO PARTICIPATE IN AN 8-WEEK HATHA YOGA PROGRAM, INCLUDING WEEKLY GROUP SESSIONS AND AT-HOME PRACTICE. DATA WERE GATHERED FROM PARTICIPANT OBSERVATION AND IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS. INTERVIEWS EXPLORED THE EXPERIENCE OF PRACTICING YOGA AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO THE PARTICIPANT'S PAIN EXPERIENCE. AN INDUCTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE INTERVIEWS EXPLORED EMERGENT THEMES FROM PARTICIPANTS' DESCRIPTIONS OF THEIR EXPERIENCE. RESULTS: ANALYSES IDENTIFIED THREE THEMES: RENEWED AWARENESS OF THE BODY; TRANSFORMED RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BODY IN PAIN; AND ACCEPTANCE. DISCUSSION: PARTICIPANTS' DATA SUGGESTED THAT THEY REFRAMED WHAT IT MEANT TO LIVE WITH CHRONIC PAIN. SOME PARTICIPANTS REPORTED THAT THE SENSORY ASPECTS OF PAIN DID NOT CHANGE BUT THAT PAIN BECAME LESS BOTHERSOME. THEY WERE BETTER ABLE TO CONTROL THE DEGREE TO WHICH PAIN INTERFERED WITH THEIR DAILY LIFE. OTHER PARTICIPANTS REPORTED LESS FREQUENT OR LESS INTENSE PAIN EPISODES BECAUSE THEY COULD RECOGNIZE BODY SIGNALS AND ADJUST THEMSELVES TO ALLEVIATE PAINFUL SENSATIONS. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT PATIENTS WHO BENEFIT FROM YOGA MAY DO SO IN PART BECAUSE YOGA ENABLES CHANGES IN COGNITIONS AND BEHAVIOURS TOWARDS PAIN.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
16 1151  38 ENHANCING ACCESSIBILITY OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY DURING PREGNANCY: A PILOT STUDY ON WOMEN'S EXPERIENCES WITH INTEGRATING YOGA INTO GROUP PRENATAL CARE. INTRODUCTION: HEALTH GUIDELINES SUGGEST THAT PREGNANT WOMEN SHOULD PARTICIPATE IN DAILY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, YET RARELY DO THEY MEET THESE GUIDELINES. MEANS TO ENHANCE ACCESSIBILITY OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOR PREGNANT WOMEN ARE REQUIRED, AND YOGA HAS BEEN SUGGESTED AS A POSSIBLE METHOD TO ENHANCE WOMEN'S SENSE OF CONFIDENCE AND COMPETENCE WITH PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. IN THIS PILOT STUDY, OUR PRIMARY AIM IS TO EVALUATE PREGNANT WOMEN'S PERCEPTIONS ABOUT THEIR LIVED EXPERIENCE OF AN INTERVENTION WHICH INTEGRATES A LOW-INTENSITY FORM OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, YOGA, INTO PRENATAL CARE; OUR SECONDARY AIM IS TO EVALUATE CHANGES IN PARTICIPANTS' SELF-EFFICACY FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND TIME SPENT IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OVER TIME. METHODS: HELD IN AN OUTPATIENT OBSTETRICS DEPARTMENT OF AN URBAN HOSPITAL SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES, THIS PILOT STUDY ENROLLED 16 PREGNANT WOMEN TO PARTICIPATE IN THE INTERVENTION THROUGHOUT THEIR PREGNANCY. WE EXPLORED PARTICIPANTS' LIVED EXPERIENCE OF THE INTERVENTION USING QUALITATIVE METHODS (PHENOMENOLOGY). MEANS, VARIANCES, AND COVARIANCES WERE CALCULATED FOR THE 2 MEASURES (SELF-EFFICACY AND TIME SPENT IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY) OVER THE INTERVENTION PERIOD. RESULTS: QUALITATIVE FINDINGS FROM FOCUS GROUPS SUGGEST THAT IT IS ACCEPTABLE FOR PRENATAL YOGA TO BE INTEGRATED INTO GROUP PRENATAL CARE CLASSES AND WOMEN REPORTED INCREASED CONFIDENCE WITH PHYSICAL ACTIVITY DURING PREGNANCY. PARTICIPANTS DID NOT CONSIDER THE INTERVENTION TO FIT WITHIN THE TRADITIONAL DEFINITION OF EXERCISE. WOMEN REPORTED INCREASED AMOUNTS OF TIME SPENT IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FROM BASELINE TO THE END OF PREGNANCY, BUT THERE WERE NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN SELF-EFFICACY OVER TIME. DISCUSSION: THE INTEGRATION OF GENTLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY INTO THE GROUP PRENATAL CARE MODEL WARRANTS FURTHER ATTENTION FOR POTENTIAL BENEFITS WITH REGARD TO MATERNAL PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WELLNESS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
17   13  34 "MORE THAN I EXPECTED": PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE AMONG OLDER ADULTS AT RISK FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED WITH PARTICIPANTS FROM TRIALS EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF AN IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE CURRENT STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF YOGA IN A POPULATION OF OLDER, PREDOMINANTLY OVERWEIGHT ADULTS PARTICIPATING IN A GENTLE 8-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM. DESIGN: THIS STUDY USED A CONSTRUCTIVIST-INTERPRETIVE APPROACH TO NATURALISTIC INQUIRY. SETTING: A TOTAL OF 42 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE INTERVENTION AND MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR THE CURRENT QUALITATIVE STUDY. INTERVENTION: THE 8-WEEK IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM INCLUDED TWO 90-MIN YOGA CLASSES AND FIVE 30-MIN HOME SESSIONS PER WEEK. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED WEEKLY LOGS AND AN EXIT QUESTIONNAIRE AT THE END OF THE STUDY. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: QUALITATIVE DATA FROM WEEKLY LOGS AND EXIT QUESTIONNAIRES WERE COMPILED AND CONVENTIONAL CONTENT ANALYSIS PERFORMED WITH THE USE OF ATLAS.TI TO FACILITATE THE PROCESS. RESULTS: FOUR BROAD THEMES EMERGED FROM CONTENT ANALYSIS: PRACTICING YOGA IMPROVED OVERALL PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND CAPACITY (FOR 83% OF PARTICIPANTS); PRACTICING YOGA REDUCED STRESS/ANXIETY AND ENHANCED CALMNESS (83% OF PARTICIPANTS); PRACTICING YOGA ENRICHED THE QUALITY OF SLEEP (21% OF PARTICIPANTS); AND PRACTICING YOGA SUPPORTED EFFORTS TOWARD DIETARY IMPROVEMENTS (14% OF PARTICIPANTS). CONCLUSIONS: THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY HAVE ANCILLARY BENEFITS IN TERMS OF IMPROVED PHYSICAL FUNCTION, ENHANCED MENTAL/EMOTIONAL STATE, ENRICHED SLEEP QUALITY, AND IMPROVED LIFESTYLE CHOICES, AND MAY BE USEFUL AS A HEALTH PROMOTION STRATEGY IN THE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC DISEASE.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
18 2659  44 YOGA IN ADULT CANCER: AN EXPLORATORY, QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE PATIENT EXPERIENCE. BACKGROUND: SOME PATIENTS RECEIVING TREATMENT IN CONVENTIONAL HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS ACCESS THERAPEUTIC YOGA OUTSIDE THEIR MAINSTREAM CARE TO IMPROVE CANCER SYMPTOMS. GIVEN THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE GAP AROUND PATIENT PREFERENCES AND DOCUMENTED EXPERIENCES OF YOGA IN ADULT CANCER, THIS STUDY AIMED TO DESCRIBE PATIENT-REPORTED BENEFITS, BARRIERS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF PROGRAMMING FOR YOGA PRACTICE DURING CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT. METHODS: IN DEPTH SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS (N=10) WERE CONDUCTED IN MEN AND WOMEN RECRUITED FROM CANCER CARE CLINICS IN VANCOUVER, CANADA USING A PURPOSIVE SAMPLING TECHNIQUE. THE EXPLORATORY INTERVIEWS WERE AUDIO-RECORDED, TRANSCRIBED AND ANALYZED USING INTERPRETIVE DESCRIPTION METHODOLOGY AND CONSTANT COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS METHODS. RESULTS: FOUR THEMES EMERGED FROM THE DATA TO ADDRESS OUR RESEARCH OBJECTIVES: PATIENT-PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF YOGA, REASONS AND MOTIVATIONS FOR PRACTISING YOGA, HURDLES AND BARRIERS TO PRACTISING YOGA, AND ADVICE FOR EFFECTIVE YOGA PROGRAM DELIVERY IN ADULT CANCER. SEVERAL PATIENTS REPORTED YOGA REDUCED STRESS AND OTHER SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH CANCER TREATMENT. THEMATIC ANALYSIS FOUND THE SOCIAL DIMENSION OF GROUP YOGA WAS IMPORTANT, AS WELL AS YOGA'S ABILITY TO ENCOURAGE PERSONAL EMPOWERMENT AND AWARENESS OF PHYSICAL BODY AND SELF. BARRIERS TO YOGA ADHERENCE FROM THE PATIENT PERSPECTIVE INCLUDED LACK OF TIME, SCHEDULING CONFLICTS AND WORRIES ABOUT FINANCIAL BURDEN. CONCLUSION: THIS SMALL, DIVERSE SAMPLE OF PATIENTS REPORTED POSITIVE EXPERIENCES AND NO ADVERSE EFFECTS FOLLOWING YOGA PRACTICE FOR MANAGEMENT OF CANCER AND ITS SYMPTOMS. RESULTS OF THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY IDENTIFIED PATIENT-REPORTED PREFERENCES, BARRIERS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA INTERVENTION OPTIMAL DURING ADULT CANCER TREATMENT.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
19 1618  31 MINDFUL YOGA PILOT STUDY SHOWS MODULATION OF ABNORMAL PAIN PROCESSING IN FIBROMYALGIA PATIENTS. PUBLISHED FINDINGS FROM A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL HAVE SHOWN THAT MINDFUL YOGA TRAINING IMPROVES SYMPTOMS, FUNCTIONAL DEFICITS, AND COPING ABILITIES IN INDIVIDUALS WITH FIBROMYALGIA AND THAT THESE BENEFITS ARE REPLICABLE AND CAN BE MAINTAINED 3 MONTHS POST-TREATMENT. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COLLECT PILOT DATA IN FEMALE FIBROMYALGIA PATIENTS (N = 7) TO DETERMINE IF INITIAL EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT MINDFUL YOGA ALSO MODULATES THE ABNORMAL PAIN PROCESSING THAT CHARACTERIZES FIBROMYALGIA. PRE- AND POST-TREATMENT DATA WERE OBTAINED ON QUANTITATIVE SENSORY TESTS AND MEASURES OF SYMPTOMS, FUNCTIONAL DEFICITS, AND COPING ABILITIES. SEPARATION TEST ANALYSES INDICATED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN HEAT PAIN TOLERANCE, PRESSURE PAIN THRESHOLD, AND HEAT PAIN AFTER-SENSATIONS AT POST-TREATMENT. FIBROMYALGIA SYMPTOMS AND FUNCTIONAL DEFICITS ALSO IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY, INCLUDING PHYSICAL TESTS OF STRENGTH AND BALANCE, AND PAIN COPING STRATEGIES. THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS WARRANTED INTO THE EFFECT OF MINDFUL YOGA ON NEUROBIOLOGICAL PAIN PROCESSING.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
20 2204  39 THE EXPERIENCE OF MINDFUL YOGA FOR OLDER ADULTS WITH DEPRESSION. WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: MINDFUL YOGA COMBINES YOGA TECHNIQUES WITH THE MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION APPROACH. PREVIOUS STUDIES ON MINDFUL YOGA HAVE REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN DEPRESSION FOR WORKING-AGE ADULTS, BUT NO STUDIES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED WITH OLDER PEOPLE. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: MINDFUL YOGA MAY BE A SAFE AND ACCEPTABLE INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE THE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH OF OLDER ADULTS WITH DEPRESSION. THE BENEFICIAL THERAPEUTIC INGREDIENTS OF MINDFUL YOGA, INCLUDED CALMNESS, BEING NON-JUDGMENTAL, LETTING GO AND SEIZING THE DAY. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: SINGLE-SEX MINDFUL YOGA GROUPS MAY BE MORE ACCEPTABLE FOR SOME PEOPLE. WELL-CONDUCTED FEASIBILITY STUDIES COMPARING MINDFUL YOGA WITH AN ALTERNATIVE GROUP-BASED APPROACH ARE NECESSARY. ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION MINDFUL YOGA COMBINES YOGA TECHNIQUES WITH THE MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION APPROACH. PREVIOUS STUDIES ON MINDFUL YOGA HAVE REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN DEPRESSION FOR WORKING-AGE ADULTS, BUT NO STUDIES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED WITH OLDER PEOPLE. AIMS TO EXPLORE THE EXPERIENCES OF OLDER ADULTS WITH DEPRESSION PARTICIPATING IN A MINDFUL YOGA GROUP TO ESTABLISH WHETHER THE APPROACH HAS POTENTIAL AS A FUTURE INTERVENTION FOR THIS CLIENT GROUP. METHOD THIS STUDY ADOPTED A QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTIVE METHOD AND USED INDUCTIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS. EIGHTEEN IN-DEPTH INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH NINE PARTICIPANTS (EACH PARTICIPANT HAD ONE INTERVIEW FOLLOWING THE PROGRAMME AND ANOTHER FOUR WEEKS LATER). RESULTS SIX MAIN THEMES EMERGED: "IMPROVED PHYSICAL STATUS," "ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THE COMMUNITY," "POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS," "PERCEIVED THERAPEUTIC INGREDIENTS," "FACILITATORS OF PRACTISING MINDFUL YOGA" AND "BARRIERS TO PRACTISING MINDFUL YOGA.". DISCUSSION MOST PARTICIPANTS REPORTED BENEFITTING FROM THE PROGRAMME. TWO MALE PARTICIPANTS EXPRESSED THAT EXERCISES WERE TOO CHALLENGING AND MORE SUITED TO WOMEN, SUGGESTING SINGLE-SEX GROUPS MAY BE MORE ACCEPTABLE. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE MINDFUL YOGA MAY BE AN ACCEPTABLE/USEFUL INTERVENTION FOR OLDER ADULTS WITH DEPRESSION, BUT FUTURE STUDIES ARE REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH ITS FEASIBILITY AND POTENTIAL EFFICACY.	2019

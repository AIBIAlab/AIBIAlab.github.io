3 2725  46 YOGA NIDRA AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IN PATIENTS WITH MENSTRUAL DISORDER. BACKGROUND: EMOTIONAL INSECURITY, STRESS, DEPRESSIVE OR/AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS ARE COMMON WITH VARIABLE SEVERITY AMONG PATIENTS WITH MENSTRUAL DISORDER. YOGIC RELAXATION THERAPY (YOGA NIDRA) LEADS TO CONSCIOUS AND SUBCONSCIOUS RECOGNITION OF THESE UNDERLYING PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS AND HELPS RELEASING OF SUPPRESSED CONFLICTS. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA NIDRA ON ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IN PATIENTS WITH MENSTRUAL DISORDERS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SUBJECTS WERE RECRUITED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY, C.S.M. MEDICAL UNIVERSITY (ERSTWHILE KGMU), LUCKNOW UTTAR PRADESH, INDIA. THE SUBJECTS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED IN TO TWO GROUPS: INTERVENTION GROUP (WITH YOGIC INTERVENTION) AND CONTROL GROUP (WITHOUT YOGIC INTERVENTION). ASSESSMENTS OF ALL SUBJECTS WERE CARRIED OUT BY ADMINISTERING HAMILTON ANXIETY SCALE (HAM-A) AND HAMILTON RATING SCALE FOR DEPRESSION (HAM-D) AT BASELINE AND AFTER SIX MONTHS. RESULTS: THE MEAN AGE WITH S.D OF THE INTERVENTION GROUP WAS 27.67 +/- 7.85 YEARS, AND FOR CONTROL GROUP WAS 26.58 +/- 6.87 YEARS (AMONG COMPLETED INTERVENTION GROUP NN = 65 AND CONTROL GROUP NN = 61). THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF SCORES IN HAM-A (P<0.003) AND HAM-D (P<0.02) RESPECTIVELY IN SUBJECTS WITH MILD TO MODERATE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AFTER SIX MONTHS OF YOGA THERAPY (YOGA NIDRA) IN INTERVENTION GROUP IN COMPARISON TO CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: THE PATIENTS WITH MILD TO MODERATE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IMPROVE SIGNIFICANTLY WITH 'YOGA NIDRA' INTERVENTION. THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE PATIENTS WITH SEVERE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS.	2012

CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT YOGA NIDRA COULD ALLEVIATE THE LIFE STRESS INTENSITY LEVEL AND INCREASE THE SELF-ESTEEM IN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
8 2726  33 YOGA NIDRA PRACTICE SHOWS IMPROVEMENT IN SLEEP IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC INSOMNIA: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND YOGA NIDRA IS PRACTISED BY SAGES FOR SLEEP. THE PRACTICE IS SIMPLE TO USE AND HAS BEEN CLEARLY LAID OUT, BUT ITS ROLE IN THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC INSOMNIA HAS NOT BEEN WELL STUDIED. METHODS IN THIS RANDOMIZED PARALLEL-DESIGN STUDY CONDUCTED DURING 2012-16, WE ENROLLED 41 PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC INSOMNIA TO RECEIVE CONVENTIONAL INTERVENTION OF COGNITIVE BEHAVIOURAL THERAPY FOR INSOMNIA (N=20) OR YOGA NIDRA (N=21). OUTCOME MEASURES WERE BOTH SUBJECTIVE USING A SLEEP DIARY AND OBJECTIVE USING POLYSOMNOGRAPHY (PSG). SALIVARY CORTISOL LEVELS WERE ALSO MEASURED. PSG WAS DONE BEFORE THE INTERVENTION IN ALL PATIENTS AND REPEATED ONLY IN THOSE WHO VOLUNTEERED FOR THE SAME. RESULTS BOTH INTERVENTIONS SHOWED AN IMPROVEMENT IN SUBJECTIVE TOTAL SLEEP TIME (TST), SLEEP EFFICIENCY, WAKE AFTER SLEEP ONSET, REDUCTION IN TOTAL WAKE DURATION AND ENHANCEMENT IN SUBJECTIVE SLEEP QUALITY. OBJECTIVELY, BOTH THE INTERVENTIONS IMPROVED TST AND TOTAL WAKE DURATION AND INCREASED N1% OF TST. YOGA NIDRA SHOWED MARKED IMPROVEMENT IN N2% AND N3% IN TST. SALIVARY CORTISOL REDUCED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER YOGA NIDRA (P=0.041). CONCLUSION IMPROVEMENT OF N3 SLEEP, TOTAL WAKE DURATION AND SUBJECTIVE SLEEP QUALITY OCCURRED FOLLOWING YOGA NIDRA PRACTICE. YOGA NIDRA PRACTICE CAN BE USED FOR TREATMENT OF CHRONIC INSOMNIA AFTER SUPERVISED PRACTICE SESSIONS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
9 2350  31 USING YOGA NIDRA RECORDINGS FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING COLONOSCOPY. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS PRODUCED BY YOGA NIDRA AND RELAXATION MUSIC FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING COLONOSCOPY. A QUASIEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN WAS USED. METHODS: IN TOTAL, 144 PATIENTS WHO WERE SCHEDULED TO UNDERGO COLONOSCOPY WERE ASSIGNED TO THREE DIFFERENT TREATMENT GROUPS. GROUP 1 WAS A NO TREATMENT CONTROL GROUP, GROUP 2 WAS DELIVERED RELAXING MUSIC, AND GROUP 3 WAS DELIVERED A YOGA NIDRA RECORDING. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS PAIN SCORE. SECONDARY TREATMENT EFFICACY MEASURES WERE AN OVERALL PATIENT SATISFACTION SCORE, A WILLINGNESS TO REPEAT THE PROCEDURE SCORE, AND A PERCEIVED COLONOSCOPE INSERTION DIFFICULTY SCORE. SECONDARY OBJECTIVE TREATMENT EFFECT MEASURES WERE SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND TOTAL PROCEDURE DURATION. RESULTS: THE PATIENTS' PERCEPTIONS OF PAIN AND THE ENDOSCOPIST'S PERCEIVED COLONOSCOPE INSERTION DIFFICULTY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BY BOTH THE MUSIC AND THE YOGA NIDRA RECORDING (P < .05). OVERALL PATIENT SATISFACTION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED BY BOTH THE MUSIC AND THE YOGA NIDRA RECORDING (P < .05). PATIENTS' WILLINGNESS TO REPEAT THE PROCEDURE AND THE TOTAL PROCEDURE DURATION WERE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED AND REDUCED, RESPECTIVELY, BY THE YOGA NIDRA RECORDING (P < .05), BUT THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES COMPARED TO THE MUSIC GROUP. THERE WERE NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AMONG THE THREE GROUPS IN TERMS OF BLOOD PRESSURE. CONCLUSIONS: BOTH THE YOGA NIDRA RECORDING AND THE RELAXATION MUSIC HELPED REDUCE THE PAIN PARTICIPANTS UNDERGOING COLONOSCOPY EXPERIENCED. THE YOGA NIDRA RECORDING WAS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL INTERVENTION AMONG THE THREE GROUPS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
10   47  25 A CLOSER LOOK AT YOGA NIDRA: SLEEP LAB PROTOCOL. EXTENDED SLEEP ONSET LATENCY (SOL), OR "SLEEP ONSET INSOMNIA," CAN DECREASE TOTAL SLEEP TIME, INCREASING RISK FOR MANY HEALTH CONDITIONS, INCLUDING HEART DISEASE, STROKE, AND ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY. SLEEP DISORDERS PERSIST IN THE UNITED STATES DESPITE CURRENT BEHAVIORAL/PHARMACEUTICAL REMEDIES, WITH 10% TO 15% OF THE POPULATION SUFFERING FROM INSOMNIA. MIND-BODY THERAPIES OFFER ADDITIONAL SOLUTIONS, AS MEDITATION HAS BEEN CORRELATED WITH DECREASED SOL. MORE RESEARCH ON USE OF MIND-BODY PRACTICES FOR INSOMNIA IS NEEDED. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE GUIDED MEDITATION PRACTICE OF YOGA NIDRA (YOGIC SLEEP) AS A PROMISING INTERVENTION FOR SLEEP DISORDERS BECAUSE OF ITS PURPORTED ABILITY TO INDUCE MENTAL, PHYSICAL, AND EMOTIONAL RELAXATION. IN THIS PILOT STUDY, WE ADDRESS THE FEASIBILITY OF YOGA NIDRA FOR INSOMNIA, APPROPRIATENESS OF OUR SELECTED MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS, AND EFFECT OF YOGA NIDRA ON BRAINWAVES, SLEEP ONSET, AND THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM. OUR STUDY SAMPLE INCLUDES 22 ADULTS, AGES 18-45, WITH INSOMNIA. THE DESIGN INCLUDES TWO CLINIC VISITS (V1, LYING QUIETLY FOR 90 MIN; V2, RANDOMIZATION TO 90-MIN LYING QUIETLY VS. 30-MIN YOGA NIDRA PLUS 60-MIN LYING QUIETLY), TAKING PLACE 1 TO 14 DAYS APART. OUTCOMES MEASURED DURING/AFTER YOGA NIDRA (VS. CONTROL) INCLUDE SLEEP ONSET, ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY (EEG) POWER, HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV), AND RESPIRATORY RATE. SELF-REPORTED MOOD AND ANXIETY WILL BE MEASURED BEFORE/AFTER EACH VISIT. RESULTING PHYSIOLOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND FEASIBILITY DATA WILL BE USED TO INFORM FUTURE CLINICAL STUDIES OF YOGA NIDRA FOR SLEEP AND RELAXATION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
11 2067  26 THE CONSCIOUSNESS STATE OF TRADITIONAL NIDRA YOGA/MODERN YOGA NIDRA: PHENOMENOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION AND PRELIMINARY INSIGHTS FROM AN EEG STUDY. NIDRA YOGA IS AN ANCIENT YOGIC PRACTICE CAPABLE OF INDUCING ALTERED STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS CHARACTERIZED BY DEEP RELAXATION, STRONG CONCENTRATION, ACUTE SELF-AWARENESS, AND JOY. IN MODERN CONTEMPLATIVE NEUROSCIENCE LANGUAGE, IT IS KNOWN BY THE NAME YOGA NIDRA, AND FEW STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED ITS PHENOMENOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS. SIX HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS (FOUR FEMALES AGED 31-74) PERFORMED 12 YOGA NIDRA SESSIONS GUIDED BY AN EXPERT DURING A 6-DAY RETREAT. EACH SESSION CONSISTED OF 10 MINUTES IN A RESTING STATE (BASELINE) FOLLOWED BY 2 HOURS OF YOGA NIDRA. PSYCHOMETRIC DATA REGARDING DISSOCIATIVE EXPERIENCES (CLINICIAN ADMINISTERED DISSOCIATIVE STATES SCALE) AND THE STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS (PHENOMENOLOGY OF CONSCIOUSNESS INVENTORY) WERE COLLECTED AFTER BASELINE AND YOGA NIDRA, WHILE HIGH-DENSITY EEG WAS RECORDED DURING THE ENTIRE SESSION. DURING NIDRA SESSIONS, NO SLEEP HALLMARKS (I.E., K-COMPLEXES AND SLEEP SPINDLES) WERE DETECTED BY THE EEG IN ANY SUBJECT. PSYCHOMETRIC DATA WE RE ANALYZED USING A WILCOXON SIGNED-RANK TEST CORRECTED WITH THE FALSE DISCOVERY RATE APPROACH FOR MULTIPLE COMPARISONS. COMPARED TO BASELINE, YOGA NIDRA PRACTICE WAS RELATED TO: (1) INCREASED DISSOCIATIVE EFFECTS (P = 0.022); (2) PERCEPTION OF BEING IN AN ALTERED STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS (P = 0.026); (3) ALTERATIONS IN PERCEIVED BODY IMAGE (P = 0.022); (4) INCREASED "MEANINGFULNESS" ATTRIBUTED TO THE EXPERIENCE (P = 0.026); (5) REDUCED RATIONAL THINKING (P = 0.029); AND (6) REDUCED VOLITIONAL THOUGHT CONTROL (P = 0.026). FIRST-PERSON EXPERIENCE IS DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO DESCRIPTIVE EEG POWER SPECTRAL DENSITY ANALYSIS, WHICH WAS PERFORMED IN ONE SUBJECT BECAUSE OF SEVERE EEG ARTIFACTS IN THE OTHER RECORDINGS; THAT SUBJECT SHOWED, COMPARED TO BASELINE: (1) EARLY INCREASE OF ALPHA AND BETA POWER, FOLLOWED BY A PROGRESSIVE WIDESPREAD REDUCTION; (2) WIDESPREAD EARLY INCREASE OF THETA POWER, FOLLOWED BY A PROGRESSIVE REDUCTION; AND (3) WIDESPREAD INCREASE OF GAMMA POWER IN THE LATEST STAGES. THE PRESENT PRELIMINARY RESULTS ENRICH THE KNOWLEDGE OF YOGA NIDRA, ELUCIDATING ITS PHENOMENOLOGY AND SUGGESTING SOME PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATES THAT FUTURE STUDIES MAY ADDRESS.	2021	

12  927  27 EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA NIDRA IN REDUCING STRESS IN SCHOOL GOING ADOLESCENTS: AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: ACADEMIC STRESS CAN EXERT SEVERE STRESS IN ADOLESCENTS ANSWERING THEIR CAREER DECIDING BOARD EXAMS. THE PRESENT STUDY ATTEMPTED TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFICACY OF YOGA NIDRA (YN) IN MITIGATING PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS. DESIGN: AND METHODS: THIS STUDY WAS CARRIED ON 10TH-GRADE STUDENTS (AGES 14 TO 16) AND HAD TWO ARMS, ONE PERFORMING YN (EXPERIMENTAL) AND THE OTHER WITHOUT YN (CONTROL) FOR 21 CONSECUTIVE DAYS. MODIFIED ADOLESCENT STRESS QUESTIONNAIRE (ASQ-I) WAS USED TO ASSESS THE STRESS IN THE STUDENTS BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION. RESULTS: THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT PERFORMING YN WAS EFFECTIVE AND SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED THE TOTAL STRESS (P < 0.001) AND VITAL DOMAINS LIKE THE STRESS OF HOME LIFE (P < 0.005), SCHOOL PERFORMANCE (P < 0.026), TEACHER INTERACTION (P < 0.024), FUTURE UNCERTAINTY (P < 0.001), SCHOOL AND LEISURE CONFLICT (P < 0.001). ALSO, AT THE END OF THE STUDY IN CONTROL, LOW AND MODERATE STRESS WAS OBSERVED IN 58.06% AND 41.93%, WHILE IN THE YN GROUP, IT WAS 96.15% AND 3.85% AND WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT YN EFFECTIVELY REDUCED PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS IN ADOLESCENTS AND COULD BE USEFUL IN SCHOOL CURRICULUM.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
13  911  28 EFFECTIVENESS OF INTEGRATIVE RESTORATION (IREST) YOGA NIDRA ON MINDFULNESS, SLEEP, AND PAIN IN HEALTH CARE WORKERS. THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTEGRATIVE RESTORATION (IREST) YOGA NIDRA MEDITATION ON MINDFULNESS, SLEEP, AND PAIN IN HEALTH CARE WORKERS. AS HEALTH CARE WORKERS PROVIDE EMOTIONAL SUPPORT TO PATIENTS, IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR WORKERS TO EXPERIENCE BOTH PHYSICAL AND MENTAL EXHAUSTION. ONE HOLISTIC APPROACH TO SUPPORT EMPLOYEES IS MINDFULNESS TRAINING. IREST YOGA NIDRA IS A COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH THERAPY THAT INCREASES MINDFULNESS. A PRE-/POSTINTERVENITON DESCRIPTIVE SURVEY DESIGN WAS USED. BEFORE AND AFTER EXPERIENCING IREST MEDITATION, PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED A 51-ITEM QUESTIONNAIRE CONSISTING OF DEMOGRAPHICS PLUS 3 VALIDATED INSTRUMENTS: THE FIVE-FACET MINDFULNESS QUESTIONNAIRE (FFMQ), THE EPWORTH SLEEPINESS SCALE (ESS), AND DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE/VETERANS ADMINISTRATION (DOD/VA) PAIN SUPPLEMENTAL QUESTIONS (PSQ). A TOTAL OF 15 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED BOTH QUESTIONNAIRES. POSTINTERVENTION FFMQ SCORES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN PREINTERVENTION (Z = -3.294, P = .001). THE HIGHEST SUBSCALE SCORES WERE "ACTING WITH AWARENESS" AND "NONJUDGING OF INNER EXPERIENCE." THERE WAS A NOT A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE MEAN ESS SCORES AT BASELINE AND FOLLOW-UP. HOWEVER, THERE WAS A STRONG NEGATIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE MEAN ESS IMPROVEMENT SCORE AND THE NUMBER OF WEEKS ATTENDED (RS = -0.705, P = .003). THERE WAS A NOT A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE MEAN PAIN BASELINE AND FOLLOW-UP SCORES. THIS STUDY SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN MINDFULNESS OF HEALTH CARE WORKERS FOLLOWING A GUIDED 8-WEEK IREST YOGA NIDRA PROGRAM. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY MAY PROVIDE SOME INSIGHT INTO HELPING HEALTH CARE WORKERS DEAL WITH THE DEMANDS OF THEIR PROFESSION IN A POSITIVE MANNER, THUS LEADING TO AN IMPROVED WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT.	2018

IT IMPROVES STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY, AND MAY HELP CONTROL PHYSIOLOGICAL VARIABLES SUCH AS BLOOD PRESSURE, LIPIDS, RESPIRATION, HEART RATE, AND METABOLIC RATE TO IMPROVE OVERALL EXERCISE CAPACITY. AIM OF THE STUDY: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGIC PRACTICE ON ANXIETY/DEPRESSION ASSOCIATED WITH OBESITY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PATIENTS WERE RECRUITED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSIOLOGY, C.S.M. MEDICAL UNIVERSITY (ERSTWHILE KGMU), LUCKNOW, UTTAR PRADESH, INDIA. A TOTAL OF 272 SUBJECTS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: 1) GROUP OF 205 SUBJECTS (WITH YOGIC PRACTICE) AND 2) A CONTROL GROUP OF 67 SUBJECTS (WITH AEROBIC EXERCISE). ASSESSMENT OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION WERE DONE BY HAMILTON RATING SCALE. RESULT: THIS STUDY SUPPORTS YOGA AS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL WITH NO DIET RESTRICTION TO IMPROVE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AS WELL AS OBESITY IN OBESE SUBJECTS CONCLUSION: INCORPORATING YOGIC ASANA IN THE TREATMENT PROTOCOL OF PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION MAY PROVE BENEFICIAL IN THE LONG RUN.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
15 2227  27 THE IMPACT OF YOGA NIDRA AND SEATED MEDITATION ON THE MENTAL HEALTH OF COLLEGE PROFESSORS. BACKGROUND: WORLD STATISTICS FOR THE PREVALENCE OF ANXIETY AND MOOD DISORDERS SHOWS THAT A GREAT NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS WILL EXPERIENCE SOME TYPE OF ANXIETY OR MOOD DISORDER AT SOME POINT IN THEIR LIFETIME. MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS HATHA YOGA AND SEATED MEDITATION HAVE BEEN USED AS A FORM OF SELF-HELP THERAPY AND IT IS ESPECIALLY USEFUL FOR CHALLENGING OCCUPATIONS SUCH AS TEACHERS AND PROFESSORS. AIMS: IN THIS INVESTIGATION, WE AIMED AT OBSERVING THE IMPACT OF YOGA NIDRA AND SEATED MEDITATION ON THE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION LEVELS OF COLLEGE PROFESSORS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SIXTY COLLEGE PROFESSORS, MEN AND WOMEN, AGED BETWEEN 30 AND 55 YEARS WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED IN ONE OF THE THREE EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS: YOGA NIDRA, SEATED MEDITATION, AND CONTROL GROUP. PROFESSORS WERE EVALUATED TWO TIMES THROUGHOUT THE 3-MONTH STUDY PERIOD. PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIABLES INCLUDED ANXIETY, STRESS, AND DEPRESSION. RESULTS: DATA ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE RELAXATION GROUP PRESENTED BETTER INTRAGROUP RESULTS IN THE ANXIETY LEVELS. MEDITATION GROUP PRESENTED BETTER INTRAGROUP RESULTS ONLY IN THE ANXIETY VARIABLE (PHYSICAL COMPONENT). INTERGROUP ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE DEPRESSION LEVELS, BOTH INTERVENTION GROUPS PRESENTED BETTER RESULTS THAN THE CONTROL GROUP IN ALL OTHER VARIABLES. CONCLUSIONS: PREPOST RESULTS INDICATE THAT BOTH INTERVENTIONS REPRESENT AN EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC APPROACH IN REDUCING ANXIETY AND STRESS LEVELS. HOWEVER, THERE WAS A TENDENCY TOWARD A GREATER EFFECTIVENESS OF THE YOGA NIDRA INTERVENTION REGARDING ANXIETY, WHICH MIGHT REPRESENT AN EFFECTIVE TOOL IN REDUCING BOTH COGNITIVE AND PHYSIOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
16  801  27 EFFECT OF YOGA NIDRA ON THE SELF-ESTEEM AND BODY IMAGE OF BURN PATIENTS. BACKGROUND: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE EFFECT OF YOGA NIDRA ON THE SELF-ESTEEM AND BODY IMAGE OF BURN PATIENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS STUDY WAS PERFORMED IN A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL MODEL WITH PRETEST AND POST-TEST CONTROL GROUPS. THE DOMAIN OF THE STUDY WAS FORMED WITH THE PATIENTS AT ADULT BURN UNIT OF A UNIVERSITY. ONE HUNDRED TEN PATIENTS PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY. THE DATA WERE COLLECTED USING THE SELF-DESCRIPTION FORM, THE ROSENBERG SELF-ESTEEM SCALE, AND THE BODY IMAGE SCALE. RESULTS: AFTER YOGA PRACTICE, THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE AND IMPROVEMENT IN THE SELF-ESTEEM AND BODY IMAGE OF THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (P<0.05). A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE SCORE AVERAGE OF PRETEST AND POST-TEST OF BODY IMAGE OF THE PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP WAS OBSERVED (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED THAT YOGA PRACTICE INCREASES SELF-ESTEEM AND IMPROVES THE BODY IMAGE OF BURN PATIENTS SIGNIFICANTLY.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
17  789  23 EFFECT OF YOGA EXERCISE ON PREMENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS AMONG FEMALE EMPLOYEES IN TAIWAN. YOGA CLASSES DESIGNED FOR WOMEN WITH PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME ARE AVAILABLE, BUT THEIR EFFICACY IS UNCLEAR. WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF 12 WEEKS' YOGA EXERCISE (YOGA INTERVENTION) ON PREMENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS IN MENSTRUATING FEMALES IN TAIWAN. SIXTY-FOUR SUBJECTS COMPLETED THE YOGA INTERVENTION, AND BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION FILLED OUT A STRUCTURED SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRE ABOUT THEIR DEMOGRAPHICS, PERSONAL LIFESTYLE, MENSTRUAL STATUS, BASELINE MENSTRUAL PAIN SCORES, PREMENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS, AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE. OF 64 SUBJECTS, 90.6% REPORTED EXPERIENCING MENSTRUAL PAIN DURING MENSTRUATION. AFTER THE YOGA INTERVENTION, SUBJECTS REPORTED DECREASED USE OF ANALGESICS DURING MENSTRUATION (P = 0.0290) AND DECREASED MODERATE OR SEVERE EFFECTS OF MENSTRUAL PAIN ON WORK (P = 0.0011). THE YOGA EXERCISE INTERVENTION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE SCALE OF PHYSICAL FUNCTION (P = 0.0340) AND BODILY PAIN (P = 0.0087) OF THE SF-36, AND SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED ABDOMINAL SWELLING (P = 0.0011), BREAST TENDERNESS (P = 0.0348), ABDOMINAL CRAMPS (P = 0.0016), AND COLD SWEATS (P = 0.0143). MENSTRUAL PAIN MITIGATION AFTER YOGA EXERCISE CORRELATED WITH IMPROVEMENT IN SIX SCALES OF THE SF-36 (PHYSICAL FUNCTION, BODILY PAIN, GENERAL HEALTH PERCEPTION, VITALITY/ENERGY, SOCIAL FUNCTION, MENTAL HEALTH). EMPLOYERS CAN EDUCATE FEMALE EMPLOYEES ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF REGULAR EXERCISE SUCH AS YOGA, WHICH MAY DECREASE PREMENSTRUAL DISTRESS AND IMPROVE FEMALE EMPLOYEE HEALTH.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
18 1178  27 EVALUATION OF STAMBHANAKARAKA YOGA AND COUNSELING IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SHUKRAGATA VATA (PREMATURE EJACULATION). PREMATURE EJACULATION (PE) IS A VERY COMMON MALE SEXUAL PROBLEM. ANXIETY, STRESS, FEAR ETC., ARE THE MAIN PREDISPOSING FACTORS OF PE. IN AYURVEDA, THIS CONDITION CAN BE CORRELATED WITH SHUKRAGATA VATA. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, FIFTY FIVE PATIENTS WITH PE WERE GROUPED INTO TWO AND WERE TREATED WITH STAMBHANAKARAKA YOGA (N = 30) AND PLACEBO (N = 20) FOR A DURATION OF TWO MONTHS, WITH LUKE WARM WATER AS ANUPANA. PSYCHOLOGICAL COUNSELING WAS GIVEN TO THE PATIENTS IN BOTH THE GROUPS. AFTER COMPLETION OF TREATMENT, STAMBHANAKARAKA YOGA SHOWED SIGNIFICANT RESULTS AGAINST PLACEBO IN ALL PARAMETERS, NAMELY INTRAVAGINAL EJACULATION LATENCY TIME (IELT), VOLUNTARY CONTROL OVER EJACULATION, PATIENT AND PARTNER'S SATISFACTION, PERFORMANCE ANXIETY.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
19 2727  36 YOGA NIDRA RELAXATION INCREASES HEART RATE VARIABILITY AND IS UNAFFECTED BY A PRIOR BOUT OF HATHA YOGA. OBJECTIVE: THE MEASUREMENT OF HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) IS OFTEN APPLIED AS AN INDEX OF AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM (ANS) BALANCE AND, THEREFORE, MYOCARDIAL STABILITY. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SUGGESTED THAT RELAXATION OR MIND-BODY EXERCISE CAN INFLUENCE ANS BALANCE POSITIVELY AS MEASURED BY HRV BUT MAY ACT VIA DIFFERENT MECHANISMS. NO STUDIES, TO THE AUTHORS' KNOWLEDGE, HAVE EXAMINED THE ACUTE RESPONSE IN HRV TO INTERVENTIONS COMBINING RELAXATION AND MIND-BODY EXERCISE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE ACUTE HRV RESPONSES TO YOGA NIDRA RELAXATION ALONE VERSUS YOGA NIDRA RELAXATION PRECEDED BY HATHA YOGA. DESIGN: THIS WAS A RANDOMIZED COUNTER-BALANCED TRIAL. SETTING: THE TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED IN A UNIVERSITY EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY LABORATORY. SUBJECTS: SUBJECTS INCLUDED 20 WOMEN AND MEN (29.15+/-6.98 YEARS OF AGE, WITH A RANGE OF 18-47 YEARS). INTERVENTIONS: PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED A YOGA PLUS RELAXATION (YR) SESSION AND A RELAXATION ONLY (R) SESSION. RESULTS: THE YR CONDITION PRODUCED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES FROM BASELINE IN HEART RATE (HR; BEATS PER MINUTE [BPM], P<0.001) AND INDICES OF HRV: R-R (MS, P<0.001), PNN50 (%, P=0.009), LOW FREQUENCY (LF; %, P=0.008) AND HIGH FREQUENCY (HF; %, P=0.035). THE R CONDITION PRODUCED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES FROM BASELINE IN HEART RATE (BPM, P<0.001) AS WELL AS INDICES OF HRV: R-R (MS, P<0.001), HF (MS(2), P=0.004), LF (%, P=0.005), HF (%, P=0.008) AND LF:HF RATIO (%, P=0.008). THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CONDITIONS AT BASELINE NOR FOR THE CHANGES FROM BASELINE FOR ANY OF THE VARIABLES. CONCLUSIONS: THESE CHANGES DEMONSTRATE A FAVORABLE SHIFT IN AUTONOMIC BALANCE TO THE PARASYMPATHETIC BRANCH OF THE ANS FOR BOTH CONDITIONS, AND THAT YOGA NIDRA RELAXATION PRODUCES FAVORABLE CHANGES IN MEASURES OF HRV WHETHER ALONE OR PRECEDED BY A BOUT OF HATHA YOGA.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
20 1844  28 QUALITATIVE IMPRESSIONS OF A YOGA NIDRA PRACTICE FOR INSOMNIA: AN EXPLORATORY MIXED-METHODS DESIGN. INTRODUCTION: INSOMNIA AFFECTS UP TO HALF OF THE U.S. POPULATION, AND DUE TO LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT TREATMENTS, THERE IS A GROWING INTEREST IN MIND-BODY PRACTICES TO REDUCE INSOMNIA. TO UNDERSTAND HOW A GUIDED MEDITATION PRACTICE, YOGA NIDRA, MAY AFFECT RELAXATION AND ALIGN WITH CURRENT DESCRIPTIONS OF NONPHARMACEUTICAL PRACTICES THAT COULD IMPROVE SLEEP, QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE METHODS WERE USED TO EXPLORE PARTICIPANT EXPERIENCE OF A SINGLE YOGA NIDRA PRACTICE, ADMINISTERED IN A GROUP SETTING. METHODS: CURRENT INSOMNIA (INSOMNIA SEVERITY INDEX), SLEEP PRACTICES, AND MOOD (POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECT SCHEDULE [PANAS]) WERE MEASURED AT INTAKE. AFTER 30 MIN OF YOGA NIDRA PRACTICE, THE PANAS WAS READMINISTERED. IN A FOCUS GROUP THAT FOLLOWED, PARTICIPANTS DISCUSSED THEIR EXPERIENCE BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER THE PRACTICE AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF REPEATING IT. SIX GROUPS WERE CONDUCTED. ALL INTERESTED ADULTS WERE WELCOME TO JOIN. RESULTS: IN THE FINAL SAMPLE OF 33 INDIVIDUALS (79% FEMALE), 80% OF PARTICIPANTS REPORTED INSOMNIA AT INTAKE AND 45% REPORTED A REGULAR MIND-BODY PRACTICE, SUPPORTING THE PREVALENCE OF INSOMNIA IN THE SOCIETY AS WELL AS THE INTEREST IN MIND-BODY PRACTICES. AFTER THE YOGA NIDRA INTERVENTION, MEAN NEGATIVE AFFECT DECREASED 5.6 +/- 4.5 POINTS, A 31% DECREASE FROM BASELINE, AND POSITIVE AFFECT DECREASED 3.5 +/- 9.7 POINTS, A 13% DECREASE. THREE MAJOR THEMES WERE IDENTIFIED FROM FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS: RESPONSE TO THE PRACTICE (RELAXATION, PERCEIVED SLEEP, AND SENSE WITHDRAWAL); FACTORS THAT AFFECT ENGAGEMENT (DELIVERY METHOD AND INTRAPERSONAL FACTORS); AND POTENTIAL AS A CLINICAL INTERVENTION (FOR CONDITIONS INCLUDING SLEEP, ANXIETY, AND PAIN). CONCLUSION: YOGA NIDRA APPEARED TOLERABLE WITHIN THE SAMPLE, AND DESCRIPTIONS SUGGEST IT MAY BE USEFUL FOR ENHANCING RELAXATION, FACILITATING SLEEP, EASING ANXIETY, AND REDUCING PAIN. RESULTS FROM THIS STUDY WILL INFORM THE DESIGN OF FUTURE STUDIES OF YOGA NIDRA FOR INSOMNIA AND RELATED CONDITIONS.	2021

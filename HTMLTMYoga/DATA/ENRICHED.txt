1 2206 115 THE EXPERIENCE OF TRAUMA CENTER-TRAUMA SENSITIVE YOGA TRAINING ON PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE OF MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND YOGA INSTRUCTORS. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: TRAUMATIC PSYCHOLOGICAL EVENTS ARE THOUGHT TO ALTER BRAIN PHYSIOLOGY, NOTABLY REGIONS SUCH AS THE THALAMUS AND THE LIMBIC SYSTEM, AFFECTING PERSONAL CHOICE, AUTONOMY, AND BEHAVIOR. INNOVATIVE THERAPIES ARE NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE DIVERSE, MENTAL AND PHYSICAL CONSEQUENCES OF THESE CHANGES. TRAUMA CENTER-TRAUMA SENSITIVE YOGA (TC-TSY) HAS SHOWN PROMISING RESULTS IN CLINICAL TRIALS AMONG INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING POSTTRAUMATIC SYMPTOMATOLOGY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: USING A QUALITATIVE, DESCRIPTIVE DESIGN, WE EXAMINED THE IMPACT OF TC-TSY TRAINING ON THE PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE OF SEVEN PRACTITIONERS WHO WERE CERTIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTORS AND/OR REGISTERED PSYCHOLOGISTS. RESULTS: THE FINDINGS SUGGEST TC-TSY TRAINING ENRICHED THEIR PRACTICES, CHIEFLY THROUGH ITS CHOICE-BASED, WIDELY APPLICABLE APPROACH; INVITATION- AND MINDFULNESS-BASED LANGUAGE; AND BUILDING OF THERAPEUTIC TRUST AND ATTUNEMENT. SOME PARTICIPANTS QUESTIONED THE ACCESSIBILITY AND SUITABILITY OF THE TRAINING, AS WELL AS THE RIGIDITY OF TC-TSY TERMINOLOGY. CONCLUSION: MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO EXAMINE POTENTIAL OUTCOMES OF TC-TSY PRACTICE RELATED TO SELF-EFFICACY, COPING, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND STRESS REDUCTION AMONG TRAUMATIZED INDIVIDUALS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
2   13  27 "MORE THAN I EXPECTED": PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE AMONG OLDER ADULTS AT RISK FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED WITH PARTICIPANTS FROM TRIALS EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF AN IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE CURRENT STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF YOGA IN A POPULATION OF OLDER, PREDOMINANTLY OVERWEIGHT ADULTS PARTICIPATING IN A GENTLE 8-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM. DESIGN: THIS STUDY USED A CONSTRUCTIVIST-INTERPRETIVE APPROACH TO NATURALISTIC INQUIRY. SETTING: A TOTAL OF 42 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE INTERVENTION AND MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR THE CURRENT QUALITATIVE STUDY. INTERVENTION: THE 8-WEEK IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM INCLUDED TWO 90-MIN YOGA CLASSES AND FIVE 30-MIN HOME SESSIONS PER WEEK. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED WEEKLY LOGS AND AN EXIT QUESTIONNAIRE AT THE END OF THE STUDY. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: QUALITATIVE DATA FROM WEEKLY LOGS AND EXIT QUESTIONNAIRES WERE COMPILED AND CONVENTIONAL CONTENT ANALYSIS PERFORMED WITH THE USE OF ATLAS.TI TO FACILITATE THE PROCESS. RESULTS: FOUR BROAD THEMES EMERGED FROM CONTENT ANALYSIS: PRACTICING YOGA IMPROVED OVERALL PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND CAPACITY (FOR 83% OF PARTICIPANTS); PRACTICING YOGA REDUCED STRESS/ANXIETY AND ENHANCED CALMNESS (83% OF PARTICIPANTS); PRACTICING YOGA ENRICHED THE QUALITY OF SLEEP (21% OF PARTICIPANTS); AND PRACTICING YOGA SUPPORTED EFFORTS TOWARD DIETARY IMPROVEMENTS (14% OF PARTICIPANTS). CONCLUSIONS: THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY HAVE ANCILLARY BENEFITS IN TERMS OF IMPROVED PHYSICAL FUNCTION, ENHANCED MENTAL/EMOTIONAL STATE, ENRICHED SLEEP QUALITY, AND IMPROVED LIFESTYLE CHOICES, AND MAY BE USEFUL AS A HEALTH PROMOTION STRATEGY IN THE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC DISEASE.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
3 1588  27 MEDICAL YOGA: ANOTHER WAY OF BEING IN THE WORLD-A PHENOMENOLOGICAL STUDY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF PERSONS SUFFERING FROM STRESS-RELATED SYMPTOMS. THE PREVALENCE OF STRESS-RELATED ILLNESS HAS GROWN IN RECENT YEARS. MANY OF THESE PATIENTS SEEK HELP IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE. YOGA CAN REDUCE STRESS AND THUS COMPLEMENTS PHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPY IN MEDICAL PRACTICE. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, NO STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED PATIENTS' EXPERIENCES OF YOGA TREATMENT IN A PRIMARY HEALTH CARE SETTING OR, SPECIFICALLY, THE EXPERIENCES OF YOGA WHEN SUFFERING FROM STRESS-RELATED ILLNESS. THUS, THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE THE MEANING OF PARTICIPATING IN MEDICAL YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR STRESS-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSIS IN A PRIMARY HEALTH CARE SETTING. THIS STUDY HAS A DESCRIPTIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL DESIGN AND TOOK PLACE AT A PRIMARY HEALTH CARE CENTRE IN SWEDEN DURING 2011. FIVE WOMEN AND ONE MAN (43-51 YEARS) PARTICIPATED. THEY WERE RECRUITED FROM THE INTERVENTION GROUP (N=18) IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL, IN WHICH THEY HAD PARTICIPATED IN A MEDICAL YOGA GROUP IN ADDITION TO STANDARD CARE FOR 12 WEEKS. DATA WERE COLLECTED BY MEANS OF QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS, AND A PHENOMENOLOGICAL DATA ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED. THE ESSENTIAL MEANING OF THE MEDICAL YOGA EXPERIENCE WAS THAT THE MEDICAL YOGA WAS NOT AN ENDPOINT OF RECOVERY BUT THE START OF A PROCESS TOWARDS AN INCREASED SENSE OF WHOLENESS. IT WAS DESCRIBED AS A WAY OF ALLEVIATING SUFFERING, AND IT PROVIDED THE PARTICIPANTS WITH A TOOL FOR DEALING WITH THEIR STRESS AND CURRENT SITUATION ON A PRACTICAL LEVEL. IT LED TO GREATER SELF-AWARENESS AND SELF-ESTEEM, WHICH IN TURN HAD AN IMPLICIT IMPACT ON THEIR LIFEWORLD. IN PHENOMENOLOGICAL TERMS, THIS CAN BE SUMMARIZED AS ANOTHER WAY OF BEING IN THE WORLD, ENCOMPASSING A PERCEPTION OF DEEPENED IDENTITY. FROM A PHILOSOPHICAL PERSPECTIVE, DUE TO USING THE BODY IN A NEW WAY (YOGA), THE PARTICIPANTS HAD LEARNT TO SEE THINGS DIFFERENTLY, WHICH ENRICHED AND RECAST THEIR PERCEPTION OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR LIVES.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
4 2491  26 YOGA AS ANTIHYPERTENSIVE LIFESTYLE THERAPY: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA AS ANTIHYPERTENSIVE LIFESTYLE THERAPY AND IDENTIFY MODERATORS THAT ACCOUNT FOR VARIABILITY IN THE BLOOD PRESSURE (BP) RESPONSE TO YOGA. METHODS: WE SYSTEMATICALLY SEARCHED 6 ELECTRONIC DATABASES FROM INCEPTION THROUGH JUNE 4, 2018, FOR ARTICLES PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE JOURNALS ON TRIALS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS THAT INVOLVED ADULT PARTICIPANTS, REPORTED PREINTERVENTION AND POSTINTERVENTION BP, AND HAD A NONEXERCISE/NONDIET CONTROL GROUP. OUR SEARCH YIELDED 49 QUALIFYING CONTROLLED TRIALS (56 INTERVENTIONS). WE (1) EVALUATED THE RISK OF BIAS AND METHODOLOGICAL STUDY QUALITY, (2) PERFORMED META-REGRESSION ANALYSIS FOLLOWING RANDOM-EFFECTS ASSUMPTIONS, AND (3) GENERATED ADDITIVE MODELS THAT REPRESENTED THE LARGEST POSSIBLE CLINICALLY RELEVANT BP REDUCTIONS. RESULTS: ON AVERAGE, THE 3517 TRIAL PARTICIPANTS WERE MIDDLE-AGED (49.2+/-19.5 YEARS), OVERWEIGHT (27.9+/-3.6 KG/M(2)) ADULTS WITH HIGH BP (SYSTOLIC BP, 129.3+/-13.3 MM HG; DIASTOLIC BP, 80.7+/-8.4 MM HG). YOGA WAS PRACTICED 4.8+/-3.4 SESSIONS PER WEEK FOR 59.2+/-25.0 MINUTES PER SESSION FOR 13.2+/-7.5 WEEKS. ON AVERAGE, YOGA ELICITED MODERATE REDUCTIONS IN SYSTOLIC BP (WEIGHTED MEAN EFFECT SIZE, -0.47; 95% CI, -0.62-0.32, -5.0 MM HG) AND DIASTOLIC BP (WEIGHTED MEAN EFFECT SIZE, -0.47; 95% CI, -0.61 TO -0.32; -3.9 MM HG) COMPARED WITH CONTROLS (P<.001 FOR BOTH SYSTOLIC BP AND DIASTOLIC BP). CONTROLLING FOR PUBLICATION BIAS AND METHODOLOGICAL STUDY QUALITY, WHEN YOGA WAS PRACTICED 3 SESSIONS PER WEEK AMONG SAMPLES WITH HYPERTENSION, YOGA INTERVENTIONS THAT INCLUDED BREATHING TECHNIQUES AND MEDITATION/MENTAL RELAXATION ELICITED BP REDUCTIONS OF 11/6 MM HG COMPARED WITH THOSE THAT DID NOT (IE, 6/3 MM HG). CONCLUSION: OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT YOGA IS A VIABLE ANTIHYPERTENSIVE LIFESTYLE THERAPY THAT PRODUCES THE GREATEST BP BENEFITS WHEN BREATHING TECHNIQUES AND MEDITATION/MENTAL RELAXATION ARE INCLUDED.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
5 2032  22 TAILORING TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA FOR HIGH-RISK POPULATIONS IN PUBLIC-SECTOR SETTINGS. LOW-INCOME, RACIAL-MINORITY, HIGH-RISK POPULATIONS HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENTS FOR POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD), AND THEIR ACCEPTANCE OF COMPLEMENTARY INTERVENTIONS IS UNKNOWN. TRAUMA CENTER TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA (TC-TSY), WHICH HAS DEMONSTRATED EFFICACY IN COMMUNITY SAMPLES, HAS NOT YET BEEN WIDELY USED WITH ETHNIC MINORITY LOW-INCOME INDIVIDUALS. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A CULTURALLY TAILORED VERSION OF A TC-TSY INTERVENTION DELIVERED AS A DROP-IN SERVICE IN A PUBLIC HOSPITAL-BASED CLINIC TO PATIENTS WITH HISTORIES OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE AND SUICIDE ATTEMPTS. TC-TSY WAS ITERATIVELY TAILORED TO MEET THE UNIQUE CLINICAL NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THIS SETTING. GROUP FACILITATOR OBSERVATIONS ARE SUMMARIZED; THEY DESCRIBE A SUCCESSFUL INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION AND CULTURALLY INFORMED ADAPTATION OF THE GROUP INTERVENTION. THE FACILITATORS' OBSERVATIONS ILLUSTRATED THAT GROUP MEMBERS ACCEPTED THE INTEGRATION OF THIS STRUCTURED, GENTLE YOGA PRACTICE INTO OUTPATIENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAMMING AND IDENTIFIED SITE-SPECIFIC MODIFICATIONS TO INFORM FORMAL STUDY. THE PROCESS BY WHICH TC-TSY WAS ADAPTED AND IMPLEMENTED FOR BLACK INDIVIDUALS WITH A HISTORY OF INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA AT RISK FOR SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR CAN SERVE AS A GUIDE FOR TAILORING OTHER COMPLEMENTARY, INTEGRATIVE INTERVENTIONS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF UNIQUE CLINICAL SETTINGS. THIS PROCESS IS OFFERED AS A FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE SYSTEMATIC TESTING OF THIS COMPLEMENTARY, INTEGRATED, CULTURALLY ADAPTED TRAUMA THERAPY IN HIGH-RISK CLINICAL POPULATIONS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
6  250  32 A YOGA INTERVENTION PROGRAM FOR PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM SYMPTOMS OF POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER: A QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTIVE STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO UNDERSTAND HOW INDIVIDUALS WITH SYMPTOMS OF POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) PERCEIVE A TRAUMA-SENSITIVE KUNDALINI YOGA (KY) PROGRAM. METHODS: DIGITALLY RECORDED TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS 30-60 MINUTES IN DURATION WERE CONDUCTED WITH 40 INDIVIDUALS WITH PTSD PARTICIPATING IN AN 8-WEEK KY TREATMENT PROGRAM. INTERVIEWS WERE TRANSCRIBED VERBATIM AND ANALYZED USING QUALITATIVE THEMATIC ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES. RESULTS: QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS IDENTIFIES THREE MAJOR THEMES: SELF-OBSERVED CHANGES, NEW AWARENESS, AND THE YOGA PROGRAM ITSELF. FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT PARTICIPANTS NOTED CHANGES IN AREAS OF HEALTH AND WELL-BEING, LIFESTYLE, PSYCHOSOCIAL INTEGRATION, AND PERCEPTIONS OF SELF IN RELATION TO THE WORLD. PRESENTED ARE PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS FOR TRAUMA-RELATED PROGRAMMING. CONCLUSION: THERE IS A NEED TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE AND POTENTIALLY EMPOWERING APPROACHES TO TRAUMA TREATMENT. YOGA-RELATED SELF-CARE OR SELF-MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES ARE WIDELY ACCESSIBLE, ARE EMPOWERING, AND MAY ADDRESS THE MIND-BODY ELEMENTS OF PTSD.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
7  383  39 BENDING WITHOUT BREAKING: A NARRATIVE REVIEW OF TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA FOR WOMEN WITH PTSD. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW IS TO EVALUATE THE PEER-REVIEWED EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON THE USE OF TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA (TSY) FOR THE TREATMENT OF WOMEN WITH POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD): SPECIFICALLY INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA SUCH AS INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE. TO DATE, NO SUCH REVIEW HAS BEEN CONDUCTED. METHODS: ARTICLES MEETING STUDY INCLUSIONARY CRITERIA WERE IDENTIFIED THROUGH ELECTRONIC DATABASE SEARCHES. A TOTAL OF FIVE STUDIES (N = 5) WERE SELECTED AND REVIEWED. THESE STUDIES INCLUDED TWO RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCT), ONE FOLLOW-UP OF AN RCT, ONE QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY, AND ONE QUALITATIVE STUDY. RESULTS: THERE IS TENTATIVE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE EFFICACY OF TSY IN REDUCING PTSD, DEPRESSION, AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMATOLOGY FOR WOMEN WITH PTSD; THERE IS ALSO TENTATIVE EVIDENCE CONFIRMING THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING TSY AS AN ADJUNCTIVE MENTAL HEALTH INTERVENTION, PARTICULARLY FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NON-RESPONSIVE TO COGNITIVE-BASED PSYCHOTHERAPIES. THE QUALITATIVE FINDINGS SPEAK TO A NUMBER OF BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE STIMULATED BY TSY PARTICIPATION CENTERING ON THE PHENOMENON OF PEACEFUL EMBODIMENT. CONCLUSIONS: REPLICATION OF THESE RESULTS USING LARGER AND MORE DIVERSE SAMPLES AND RIGOROUS STUDY DESIGNS BY INDEPENDENT RESEARCHERS WOULD ADD CREDIBILITY TO THESE FINDINGS AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE GROWING BODY OF KNOWLEDGE ON TSY. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS A DEARTH OF STUDIES ON THIS NASCENT FORM OF THERAPEUTIC YOGA. THEREFORE, FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL EFFICACY OF TSY WITH OTHER TYPES OF TRAUMA, POPULATIONS, AND SETTINGS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
8 1342  29 HOW YOGA HELPS HEAL INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA: PERSPECTIVES AND THEMES FROM 11 INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA SURVIVORS. TRAUMA IS UBIQUITOUS IN OUR SOCIETY; THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO EXPLORE HOW INDIVIDUALS CULTIVATE HEALING AFTER TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES. YOGA MAY BE ONE AVENUE TO CULTIVATE HEALING. QUALITATIVE METHODS WERE EMPLOYED TO STUDY THE ROLE YOGA PRACTICE PLAYED IN THE HEALING PROCESS OF THOSE WHO EXPERIENCED INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA. ELEVEN INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA SURVIVORS WHO PRACTICED YOGA REGULARLY WERE IDENTIFIED THROUGH A CRITERION SAMPLING METHOD. DATA ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE EMPHASIS OF YOGA ON MIND AND PHYSICAL BODY FOSTERED NUMEROUS POSITIVE OUTCOMES, SUCH AS SPIRITUAL GROWTH, SELF-ACCEPTANCE, ALLEVIATION OF TRAUMA-RELATED SYMPTOMS, AND INCREASED FEELINGS OF SELF-COMPASSION, EMPOWERMENT, AND SERENITY. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY BE HELPFUL TO REGAIN MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH, FOSTER WELLBEING, AND CULTIVATE PERSONAL GROWTH AFTER INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA.	2016

10   20  30 "WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER": A QUALITATIVE STUDY OF PREDOMINANTLY LOW INCOME MINORITY PARTICIPANTS IN A YOGA TRIAL FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. OBJECTIVE: TO EXPLORE THE EXPERIENCES OF LOW-INCOME MINORITY ADULTS TAKING PART IN A YOGA DOSING TRIAL FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. DESIGN: INDIVIDUAL SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH NINETEEN PARTICIPANTS RECRUITED FROM A RANDOMIZED YOGA DOSING TRIAL FOR PREDOMINANTLY LOW-INCOME MINORITY ADULTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. INTERVIEWS DISCUSSED THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON LOW BACK PAIN AND EMOTIONS; OTHER PERCEIVED ADVANTAGES OR DISADVANTAGES OF THE INTERVENTION; AND FACILITATORS AND BARRIERS TO PRACTICING YOGA. INTERVIEWS WERE AUDIO TAPED AND TRANSCRIBED, CODED USING ATLAS.TI SOFTWARE, AND ANALYZED WITH INDUCTIVE AND DEDUCTIVE THEMATIC ANALYSIS METHODS. SETTING: BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER, BOSTON, MA, USA. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS VIEWED YOGA AS A MEANS OF PAIN RELIEF AND ATTRIBUTED IMPROVED MOOD, GREATER ABILITY TO MANAGE STRESS, AND ENHANCED RELAXATION TO YOGA. OVERALL, PARTICIPANTS FELT EMPOWERED TO SELF-MANAGE THEIR PAIN. SOME FOUND YOGA TO BE HELPFUL IN BEING MINDFUL OF THEIR EMOTIONS AND ACCEPTING OF THEIR PAIN. TRUST IN THE YOGA INSTRUCTORS WAS A COMMONLY CITED FACILITATOR FOR YOGA CLASS ATTENDANCE. LACK OF TIME, MOTIVATION, AND FEAR OF INJURY WERE REPORTED BARRIERS TO YOGA PRACTICE. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA IS A MULTIDIMENSIONAL TREATMENT FOR LOW BACK PAIN THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO FAVORABLY IMPACT HEALTH IN A PREDOMINANTLY LOW-INCOME MINORITY POPULATION.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
11 2317  36 TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA INTERVENTIONS AND POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS AND DEPRESSION OUTCOMES AMONG WOMEN: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT MOST PEOPLE EXPERIENCE AT LEAST ONE TRAUMATIC EVENT IN THEIR LIFETIMES, AND BETWEEN 6% AND 8% OF THOSE WITH A HISTORY OF TRAUMA WILL DEVELOP POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) AND/OR RELATED MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. WOMEN FACE A GREATER THREAT OF TRAUMA EXPOSURE AND HAVE A HIGHER RISK OF PTSD AND DEPRESSION THAN MEN. TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA (TSY), A BODY-BASED ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY, HAS SHOWN POTENTIAL IN SEVERAL STUDIES AS AN EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR REDUCING PTSD AND DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS. HOWEVER, EXISTING RESEARCH AND SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS VARY WIDELY IN THEIR METHODOLOGICAL RIGOR AND COMPARISON SAMPLES. THUS, IN THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TSY AMONG WOMEN WITH A HISTORY OF TRAUMA AND DEPRESSION WHO HAD PARTICIPATED IN RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS WITH CLEAR CONTROL AND EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS. FINDINGS IN FIXED- AND MIXED-EFFECTS META-ANALYSIS MODELS SUGGEST MARGINALLY SIGNIFICANT TO NO EFFECTS OF TSY ON PTSD AND DEPRESSION OUTCOMES. OUR SYSTEMATIC REVIEW HIGHLIGHTS CRITICAL QUESTIONS AND SIGNIFICANT GAPS IN THE EXISTING LITERATURE ABOUT THE RATIONALE AND BEST PRACTICES OF TSY INTERVENTION DURATION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
12 2632  31 YOGA FOR TRAUMA AND RELATED MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS: A META-REVIEW WITH CLINICAL AND SERVICE RECOMMENDATIONS. HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE EXPRESSED GROWING INTEREST IN THE BENEFITS OF YOGA TO HELP INDIVIDUALS COPE WITH THE EFFECTS OF TRAUMA, INCLUDING ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD). DESPITE THE GROWING POPULARITY AND STRONG APPEAL OF YOGA, PROVIDERS MUST BE MINDFUL OF THE EVIDENCE REGARDING THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN TREATING TRAUMA EFFECTS AS WELL AS TRAUMA-RELATED MENTAL HEALTH SYMPTOMS AND ILLNESSES. THEREFORE, OUR RESEARCH TEAM SOUGHT TO ANSWER TWO QUESTIONS: (A) WHAT IS THE EVIDENCE REGARDING YOGA AS A TREATMENT FOR TRAUMA EFFECTS, INCLUDING ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND PTSD AND (B) WHAT ARE THE CLINICAL AND SERVICE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR USING YOGA WITH TRAUMA-EXPOSED INDIVIDUALS? OUR INITIAL SCANS IDENTIFIED A SUBSTANTIAL BODY OF RESEARCH, INCLUDING REVIEWS. RATHER THAN REPLICATE EARLIER EFFORTS, WE UNDERTOOK A SYSTEMATIC META-REVIEW OF 13 LITERATURE REVIEWS, ONE OF WHICH INCLUDED A META-ANALYSIS. WE DETERMINED THE 13 REVIEWS EXAMINED 185 DISTINCT STUDIES. FINDINGS SHOW THAT THE EVIDENCE REGARDING YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR THE EFFECTS OF TRAUMA AS WELL AS THE MENTAL HEALTH SYMPTOMS AND ILLNESSES OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH TRAUMA IS ENCOURAGING BUT PRELIMINARY. OVERALL, THE BODY OF RESEARCH IS LACKING IN RIGOR AS WELL AS SPECIFICITY REGARDING TRAUMA. REVIEW RESULTS ALSO ONLY ALLOW FOR THE RECOMMENDATION OF YOGA AS AN ANCILLARY TREATMENT. FURTHER, THE REVIEWS HAD CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCES IN THEIR METHODS AND LIMITATIONS. NONETHELESS, THE RESULTS YIELDED FINDINGS CONCERNING HOW CLINICIANS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS CAN USE YOGA IN THEIR OWN PRACTICES, WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FOR BUILDING AN EVIDENCE BASE IN THIS AREA.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
13  491  21 CO-DESIGNING A NEW YOGA-BASED MINDFULNESS INTERVENTION FOR SURVIVORS OF STROKE: A FORMATIVE EVALUATION. MOVEMENT-BASED MINDFULNESS INTERVENTIONS (MBI) ARE COMPLEX, MULTI-COMPONENT INTERVENTIONS FOR WHICH THE DESIGN PROCESS IS RARELY REPORTED. FOR PEOPLE WITH STROKE, EMERGING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS BENEFITS, BUT MAINSTREAM PROGRAMS ARE GENERALLY UNSUITABLE. WE AIMED TO DESCRIBE THE PROCESSES INVOLVED AND TO CONDUCT A FORMATIVE EVALUATION OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL YOGA-BASED MBI DESIGNED FOR SURVIVORS OF STROKE. WE USED THE MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL COMPLEX INTERVENTIONS FRAMEWORK AND PRINCIPLES OF CO-DESIGN. WE PURPOSEFULLY APPROACHED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND CONSUMERS TO ESTABLISH AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR DEVELOPING THE INTERVENTION. MEMBERS COLLABORATED AND ITERATIVELY REVIEWED THE DESIGN AND CONTENT OF THE PROGRAM, FORMATTED INTO A TRAINING MANUAL. FOUR EXTERNAL YOGA TEACHERS INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWED THE PROGRAM. FORMATIVE EVALUATION INCLUDED REVIEW OF MULTIPLE DATA SOURCES AND DOCUMENTATION (E.G., FORMAL MEETING MINUTES, FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS, RESEARCHER OBSERVATIONS). THE DATA WERE SYNTHESIZED USING INDUCTIVE THEMATIC ANALYSIS. THREE BROAD THEMES EMERGED: (A) MBI CONTENT AND TERMINOLOGY; (B) MANUAL DESIGN AND READABILITY; AND (C) BARRIERS AND ENABLERS TO DELIVER THE INTERVENTION. VARIOUS PERSPECTIVES AND FEEDBACK ON ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS GUIDED FINALIZING THE PROGRAM. THE DESIGN PHASE OF A NOVEL YOGA-BASED MBI WAS STRENGTHENED BY INTERDISCIPLINARY, CONSUMER CONTRIBUTIONS AND PEER REVIEW. THE 12-WEEK INTERVENTION IS READY FOR TESTING AMONG SURVIVORS OF STROKE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
14 2574  24 YOGA FOR EVERYONE: A QUALITATIVE STUDY OF A COMMUNITY YOGA CLASS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITY. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: PEOPLE WITH MOBILITY IMPAIRMENTS FACE INCREASED BARRIERS TO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. THE STUDY AIMED TO UNDERSTAND THE LIVED EXPERIENCES OF INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITY WHO ARE REGULAR PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA FOR EVERYONE CLASS TO INFORM FUTURE RESEARCH, INTERVENTION AND COMMUNITY PROGRAMS.METHODS: A PHENOMENOLOGICAL QUALITATIVE APPROACH UTILIZED SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS AND CLASS OBSERVATIONS. DATA WAS ANALYZED THROUGH ITERATIVE INDUCTIVE THEMATIC ANALYSIS.RESULTS: SIX PEOPLE OF VARIED MOBILITY LIMITATIONS PARTICIPATED. THEMATIC ANALYSIS REVEALED THEMES ON INFLUENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND PERSONAL FACTORS, A HOLISTIC-FOCUSED CLASS ENVIRONMENT, PHYSICAL IMPROVEMENTS, MENTAL/EMOTIONAL IMPACT, AND A SENSE OF BELONGING TO COMMUNITY.CONCLUSION: THE YOGA FOR EVERYONE CLASS FOSTERED MULTI-FACETED OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE WITH DIVERSE MOVEMENT IMPAIRMENTS. FOCUSING ON COMMUNITY-CLINICAL PARTNERSHIPS, UTILIZING A CLASS STRUCTURE WITH VOLUNTEERS, AND FOSTERING AN ONGOING INCLUSIVE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT ARE POTENTIAL STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS IN OTHER COMMUNITY PROGRAMS FOR THOSE WITH DISABILITY.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
15 2312  32 TRAUMA SENSITIVE YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER: A QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS. RESEARCH ON POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AND CHRONIC CHILDHOOD ABUSE HAS REVEALED THAT TRADITIONAL TRAUMA TREATMENTS OFTEN FAIL TO FULLY ADDRESS THE COMPLICATED SYMPTOM PRESENTATION, INCLUDING THE SOMATIC COMPLAINTS, LOSS OF AWARENESS OF ONE'S EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL BEING IN THE PRESENT MOMENT, AND OVERALL LACK OF INTEGRATION BETWEEN THE SELF AND THE BODY. THE MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTION OF HATHA YOGA SHOWS PROMISE AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT, AND FOCUSES ON PERSONAL GROWTH IN ADDITION TO SYMPTOM REDUCTION. THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY EXPLORED THE EXPERIENCES OF THIRTY-ONE ADULT WOMEN WITH PTSD RELATED TO CHRONIC CHILDHOOD TRAUMA WHO PARTICIPATED IN A 10-WEEK TRAUMA SENSITIVE YOGA CLASS, SPECIFICALLY EXAMINING PERCEIVED CHANGES IN SYMPTOMS AND PERSONAL GROWTH.

16 2520  37 YOGA COMPLEMENTS COGNITIVE BEHAVIOUR THERAPY AS AN ADJUNCT TREATMENT FOR ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION: QUALITATIVE FINDINGS FROM A MIXED-METHODS STUDY. OBJECTIVES: COGNITIVE BEHAVIOUR THERAPY (CBT) IS RECOMMENDED FOR TREATING ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, DEMONSTRATING GOOD EFFICACY AND MODERATE RATES OF ENGAGEMENT. TO FURTHER IMPROVE OUTCOMES AND ACCESS TO EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENTS, RESEARCHERS HAVE SOUGHT TO ENHANCE CBT PROTOCOLS WITH MINDFULNESS-BASED APPROACHES, SUCH AS YOGA. THIS STUDY AIMED TO EXAMINE WHETHER YOGA IS AN ACCEPTABLE AND COMPLEMENTARY ADJUNCT TO CBT THROUGH EXPLORING THE LIVED EXPERIENCES OF ADULTS WITH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION WHO ENGAGED IN AN ADJUNCT THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAMME ALONGSIDE GROUP CBT. DESIGN: SINGLE-GROUP QUALITATIVE DESIGN WITH POST-INTERVENTION AND FOLLOW-UP TIMEPOINTS. METHODS: THIRTY-SIX ADULTS WITH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SELF-SELECTED INTO A THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAMME AS AN ADJUNCT TO GROUP CBT. QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH 27 PARTICIPANTS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE EIGHT-WEEK PROGRAMME AND AGAIN THREE MONTHS LATER. THEMATIC ANALYSIS WAS USED TO IDENTIFY COMMON THEMES FROM THE LIVED EXPERIENCES. RESULTS: THREE PRIMARY THEMES, WITH NINE SUBTHEMES, WERE IDENTIFIED WHICH REFLECT THE EXPERIENCES OF THE COMBINED THERAPIES, THE COMPLEMENTARY ELEMENTS, AND PROCESS OF ENGAGEMENT OVER TIME. THE ADJUNCT YOGA PROGRAMME WAS HIGHLY ACCEPTABLE TO ADULTS WITH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, ENHANCING ENGAGEMENT AND PERCEIVED OUTCOMES. YOGA WAS IDENTIFIED AS PROVIDING A UNIQUE COMBINATION OF ELEMENTS THAT COMPLEMENTED PROCESSES OF CBT, SUCH AS BEHAVIOURAL ACTIVATION AND THOUGHT DISPUTATION. YOGA PRACTICES REPRESENTED MENTAL HEALTH SELF-MANAGEMENT TOOLS THAT ARE ACCESSIBLE AND AVAILABLE AS RELAPSE PREVENTION STRATEGIES. CONCLUSIONS: THERAPEUTIC YOGA WARRANTS CONSIDERATION AS AN ADJUNCT TREATMENT FOR ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AS IT OFFERS UNIQUE AND COMPLEMENTARY ELEMENTS TO CBT AND CAN ENHANCE ENGAGEMENT AND PERCEIVED CLINICAL OUTCOMES. PRACTITIONER POINTS: ADULTS WITH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION EXPERIENCED A THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAMME AS A SUITABLE AND APPEALING ADJUNCT THAT ENHANCED ENGAGEMENT WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENT. YOGA OFFERS A UNIQUE COMBINATION OF ELEMENTS, INCLUDING A VALUES SYSTEM, BODY-BASED MINDFULNESS PRACTICES, AND BREATHING TECHNIQUES, THAT COMPLEMENT CBT PROCESSES, SUCH AS BEHAVIOURAL ACTIVATION, AWARENESS OF MALADAPTIVE PATTERNS, AND THOUGHT DISPUTATION. A THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAMME PROVIDES ADULTS WITH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION WITH AN ACCESSIBLE AND SUSTAINABLE MENTAL HEALTH SELF-MANAGEMENT TOOL. THERAPEUTIC YOGA CAN BE CONSIDERED FOR INTEGRATION TO MODELS OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE PROVISION TO ENHANCE ENGAGEMENT AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES FOR ADULTS WITH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION.	2021	

17  156  30 A QUALITATIVE STUDY OF LOVEYOURBRAIN YOGA: A GROUP-BASED YOGA WITH PSYCHOEDUCATION INTERVENTION TO FACILITATE COMMUNITY INTEGRATION FOR PEOPLE WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. PURPOSE: TO EXPLORE PARTICIPANTS' EXPERIENCES IN A GROUP-BASED YOGA WITH PSYCHOEDUCATION INTERVENTION DESIGNED TO FACILITATE COMMUNITY INTEGRATION FOR PEOPLE WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS.MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE CONDUCTED SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH 13 PEOPLE WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND THREE CAREGIVERS WHO HAD COMPLETED LOVEYOURBRAIN YOGA, A 6-SESSION, MANUALIZED, GROUP-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION THAT INCORPORATES BREATHING EXERCISES, YOGA, MEDITATION, AND PSYCHOEDUCATION. INTERVIEWS WERE ANALYZED USING CONTENT ANALYSIS.RESULTS: WE IDENTIFIED SEVEN THEMES: EASE OF PARTICIPATION, BELONGING, SUSTAINING COMMUNITY CONNECTION, PHYSICAL HEALTH, SELF-REGULATION, SELF-EFFICACY, AND RESILIENCE. ALL PARTICIPANTS VALUED THE COMMUNITY-BASED YOGA STUDIO ENVIRONMENT AND MULTIFACETED STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM. PARTICIPANTS REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN STRENGTH, BALANCE, FLEXIBILITY, AND ATTENTION CONTROL, AND A GREATER SENSE OF BELONGING, COMMUNITY CONNECTION, AND ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR LIVES. PARTICIPANTS REPORTED ONGOING USE OF TOOLS (E.G., BREATHING EXERCISES) TO COPE WITH NEGATIVE EMOTIONS AND STRESS. ABOUT HALF OF PARTICIPANTS SUSTAINED RELATIONSHIPS BUILT DURING LOVEYOURBRAIN YOGA AND FELT MORE CAPABLE OF ACCESSING OTHER ACTIVITIES IN THEIR COMMUNITY.CONCLUSIONS: LOVEYOURBRAIN YOGA SUCCESSFULLY PROMOTED COMMUNITY INTEGRATION FOR PEOPLE WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY. IT ALSO FACILITATED DIVERSE AND MEANINGFUL PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND SOCIAL HEALTH BENEFITS, WHICH SUGGEST THAT IT MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE MODE OF COMMUNITY-BASED REHABILITATION.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONTRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY SURVIVORS OFTEN STRUGGLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR COMMUNITY, THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF REHABILITATIONYOGA IS A HOLISTIC THERAPY WITH MANY BENEFITS, YET IS NOT ACCESSIBLE TO THE TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY POPULATION AT THE COMMUNITY LEVELPARTICIPANTS IN A COMMUNITY-BASED YOGA WITH PSYCHOEDUCATION INTERVENTION IN SIX STATES EXPERIENCED DIVERSE AND MEANINGFUL PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND SOCIAL HEALTH BENEFITSGROUP-BASED YOGA WITH PSYCHOEDUCATION MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE MODE OF COMMUNITY INTEGRATION AND COMMUNITY-BASED REHABILITATION FOR TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY SURVIVORS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
18  157  28 A QUALITATIVE STUDY ON THE PRACTICE OF YOGA FOR WOMEN WITH PAIN-ASSOCIATED ENDOMETRIOSIS. OBJECTIVES: TO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING WOMEN WITH PAIN-ASSOCIATED ENDOMETRIOSIS ATTRIBUTE TO YOGA PRACTICE REGARDING THEIR PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL STATE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PRACTICE; PAIN MANAGEMENT BY INTEGRATING BODY AND MIND; SECONDARY BENEFITS OF THE PRACTICE OF YOGA, SUCH AS SELF-KNOWLEDGE, SELF-CARE, AND AUTONOMY; AND THE ROLE OF THE YOGA GROUP AS PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT. DESIGN: QUALITATIVE STUDY CONDUCTED SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. SETTING: PUBLIC UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL IN SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL BETWEEN AUGUST 2013 AND DECEMBER 2014. PARTICIPANTS: FIFTEEN WOMEN WITH PAIN-ASSOCIATED ENDOMETRIOSIS WHO PRACTICED YOGA FOR 8 WEEKS. INTERVENTION: AFTER COMPLETING THE TWICE-A-WEEK PROGRAM, ALL WOMEN PARTICIPATED IN A SINGLE, SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW. INTERVIEWS WERE RECORDED AND TRANSCRIBED VERBATIM, AND THEMATIC ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE MAIN THEMES OF ANALYSIS WERE WOMEN'S EXPECTATIONS REGARDING THE PRACTICE OF YOGA, PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL STATE OF WOMEN AT THE BEGINNING OF YOGA PRACTICE, CONTROL AND PAIN MANAGEMENT THROUGH THE INTEGRATION OF BODY AND MIND, SECONDARY BENEFITS, ACQUISITION OF SELF-KNOWLEDGE AND AUTONOMY, AND THE ROLE OF YOGA GROUP AS PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT. RESULTS: ALL PARTICIPANTS REPORTED THAT YOGA WAS BENEFICIAL TO CONTROL PELVIC PAIN. THEY RELATED THAT THEY WERE AWARE OF THE INTEGRATION OF BODY AND PSYCHE DURING YOGA PRACTICE AND THAT THIS HELPED IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PAIN. WOMEN SAID THEY HAD IDENTIFIED A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PAIN MANAGEMENT AND BREATHING TECHNIQUES (PRANAYAMA) LEARNED IN YOGA AND THAT BREATHING INCREASED THEIR ABILITY TO BE INTROSPECTIVE, WHICH RELIEVED PAIN. THE PARTICIPANTS HAVE DEVELOPED GREATER SELF-KNOWLEDGE, AUTONOMY, AND SELF-CARE AND HAVE REDUCED THE USE OF PAIN AND PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATIONS. THEY CREATED TIES AMONG THEMSELVES, SUGGESTING THAT THE YOGA GROUP ALLOWED PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT. CONCLUSIONS: BODILY AND PSYCHOSOCIAL MECHANISMS TO CONTROL PAIN WERE IDENTIFIED IN WOMEN WITH ENDOMETRIOSIS. TO REACH SUCH CONTROL, IT IS CRUCIAL THAT MIND AND BODY INTEGRATIVE TECHNIQUES ARE LEARNED.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
19 2795  36 YOGA THERAPY FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL AND VETERANS: QUALITATIVE PERSPECTIVES OF YOGA STUDENTS AND INSTRUCTORS. OBJECTIVE: MILLIONS OF MILITARY PERSONNEL AND VETERANS LIVE WITH CHRONIC MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH CONDITIONS THAT OFTEN DO NOT RESPOND WELL TO PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENTS. SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS AND LACK OF TREATMENT RESPONSE HAVE LED TO WIDESPREAD EFFORTS TO STUDY AND PROMOTE NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENTS FOR MANY CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS. YOGA IS AN INCREASINGLY POPULAR MIND-BODY INTERVENTION THAT HAS GROWING RESEARCH SUPPORT FOR ITS EFFICACY AND SAFETY. OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO EXPLORE THE ATTITUDES, PERSPECTIVES, AND PREFERENCES OF MILITARY PERSONNEL AND VETERANS TOWARD YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC MODALITY, THUS PROVIDING NEEDED INFORMATION FOR DESIGNING AND PROMOTING YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR THIS POPULATION. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED 24 INDIVIDUALS WITH YOGA EXPERIENCE AND CURRENT OR PAST MILITARY SERVICE AND 12 INSTRUCTORS WHO HAVE TAUGHT YOGA FOR MILITARY PERSONNEL AND/OR VETERANS. A SEMI-STRUCTURED SET OF QUESTIONS GUIDED INTERVIEWS WITH EACH PARTICIPANT. RESULTS: FIVE THEMES EMERGED FROM THE INTERVIEWS: (1) MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS EXPERIENCED FROM YOGA PRACTICE; (2) PHYSICAL HEALTH BENEFITS EXPERIENCED FROM YOGA PRACTICE; (3) IMPORTANT YOGA ELEMENTS AND CONDITIONS THAT SUPPORT EFFECTIVE PRACTICE; (4) FACILITATORS FOR ENGAGING MILITARY IN YOGA PRACTICE; AND (5) CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS TO YOGA PRACTICE FOR MILITARY. CONCLUSIONS: THE STUDY HIGHLIGHTS CONSISTENT REPORTS OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE, ONGOING STIGMA RESULTING IN THE NEED FOR COMBATTING AND DEMYSTIFYING YOGA AND OTHER COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH (CIH) PRACTICES, THE IMPORTANCE OF DESIGNING INTERVENTIONS TO ADDRESS THE UNIQUE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND PERSPECTIVES OF THIS POPULATION, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF EFFORTS BY MILITARY LEADERSHIP TO BRING CIH TO MILITARY PERSONNEL AND VETERANS. RIGOROUS RESEARCH ADDRESSING THESE FINDINGS, ALONG WITH FURTHER RESEARCH ON THE EFFICACY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR TREATING VARIOUS CONDITIONS ARE NEEDED.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
20 2247  35 THE INTEGRATION OF YOGA IN PHYSICAL THERAPY CLINICAL PRACTICE. HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ARE BEGINNING TO USE YOGA AS A TREATMENT MODALITY. HOWEVER, EVIDENCE EXPLAINING PHYSICAL THERAPISTS' INTEGRATION OF YOGA IN CLINICAL PRACTICE IS LACKING. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE HOW, WHY, AND WITH WHOM PHYSICAL THERAPISTS INTEGRATE YOGA INTO CLINICAL PRACTICE. DESIGN: THIS STUDY IS A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF QUALITATIVE DATA COLLECTED DURING A LARGER MULTI-METHODS STUDY. THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF 13 INTERVIEWS WAS CONDUCTED. RESULTS: ANALYSIS INDICATED FOUR THEMES, AND SIX SUBTHEMES. FACILITATING YOGA IN CLINICAL PRACTICE AND YOGA TRAINING THEMES; INCLUDING EVALUATION OF OUTCOMES, BILLING, TERMINOLOGY, AND SAFETY SUBTHEMES DESCRIBE HOW PHYSICAL THERAPISTS ARE USING YOGA IN CLINICAL PRACTICE. THE PERCEIVED CLIENT OUTCOMES THEME, INCLUDING PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES EXPLAIN WHY PHYSICAL THERAPISTS USE YOGA IN PRACTICE. THE YOGA WITH CLINICAL POPULATIONS THEME ADDRESSES WITH WHOM PHYSICAL THERAPISTS ARE USING YOGA. CONCLUSION: PHYSICAL THERAPISTS ARE USING YOGA WITH INDIVIDUALS WITH VARIOUS HEALTH CONDITIONS TO IMPROVE THEIR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. FINDINGS SUPPORT THE NEED FOR PHYSICAL THERAPISTS TO INCREASE THEIR ASSESSMENT AND DOCUMENTATION OF FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH CLIENT'S YOGA PARTICIPATION. DOCUMENTATION COULD CONTRIBUTE TO EVIDENCE-BASED LITERATURE RELATED TO HOW, WHY, AND WITH WHOM PHYSICAL THERAPISTS ARE USING YOGA. DOCUMENTED OUTCOMES COULD ALSO PROVIDE RATIONALE FOR YOGA TO RECEIVE CLASSIFICATION AS A REIMBURSABLE COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH APPROACH. FUTURE RESEARCH INVOLVING A LARGER, DIVERSE SAMPLE (E.G., PHYSICAL THERAPISTS WITH VARYING LEVELS OF EDUCATION AND YOGA TRAINING) FOCUSED ON HOW, WHY, AND WITH WHOM PHYSICAL THERAPISTS INTEGRATE YOGA INTO CLINICAL PRACTICE IS RECOMMENDED.	2021

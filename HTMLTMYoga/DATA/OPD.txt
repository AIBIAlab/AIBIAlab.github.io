1  776 111 EFFECT OF YOGA AND NATUROPATHY-BASED LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION ON LEFT VENTRICULAR EJECTION FRACTION IN A PATIENT WITH SEVERE TRIPLE VESSEL DISEASE: A CASE REPORT. A 75-YEAR-OLD, MARRIED MAN WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD) [SEVERE TRIPLE VESSEL DISEASE (TVD)] IN THE 2(ND) WEEK, JUNE-2018. THE PHYSICIAN ADVISED HIM TO UNDERGO CONVENTIONAL MEDICATION AND CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT. SINCE THE PATIENT REFUSED TO UNDERGO SURGERY HE WAS ADMITTED IN OUR HOSPITAL AND UNDERWENT YOGA AND NATUROPATHY-BASED LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION (YNLM) ALONG WITH CONVENTIONAL MEDICINES FOR 16 WEEKS [12 WEEKS OF INTENSIVE CARE AT INPATIENT DEPARTMENT AND 4 WEEKS AT OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENT (OPD)]. AFTER 16 WEEKS, THE PATIENT VISITED OUR OPD ONCE/TWICE A MONTH FOR 6 MONTHS. AN INCREASE IN LEFT VENTRICULAR EJECTION FRACTION FROM 35 TO 48%; AND A REDUCTION IN WEIGHT FROM 77.5 TO 71-KG, AND BMI FROM 26.60 TO 24-KG/M(2) WERE OBSERVED AFTER 6 MONTHS OF FOLLOW-UP COMPARED WITH BASELINE. THUS, YNLM MIGHT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ADJUVANT IN REDUCING RISK FACTOR AND IN IMPROVING LEFT VENTRICULAR SYSTOLIC DYSFUNCTION IN PATIENTS WITH CAD (SEVERE-TVD). HOWEVER, FURTHER STUDIES ARE REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH THE EFFICACY OF YNLM FOR CAD.	2020

BACKGROUND: DUE TO SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE AND STRESS, THE INCIDENCE OF METABOLIC DISORDERS ARE INCREASING DAY BY DAY. AMONG THESE POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME (PCOS) IS AN INTRICATE DISORDER AFFECTING 4%-8% WOMEN IN THEIR REPRODUCTIVE AGE AND RELATED TO OVARIAN DYSFUNCTION CHARACTERIZED BY OBESITY, OLIGOMENORRHEA, ANOVULATION AND HYPERANDROGENISM. IN MODERN SYSTEM OF MEDICINE, THE AVAILABLE ALLOPATHIC REGIMEN HAS ITS OWN LIMITATIONS, SO IT IS NEED OF TIME TO FIND A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE THERAPY FOR SUCH TYPE OF CONDITION. THE MOST COMMON SYMPTOM IN 85%-90% OF PCOS PATIENTS IS OLIGOMENORRHEA WHICH CAN BE CORRELATED TO ARTAVA KSHAYA (LOSS OF MENSTRUAL FLUID) IN AYURVEDA. HENCE, IN THE PRESENT CLINICAL STUDY, VAMANA KARMA (THERAPEUTIC VOMITING) WITH IKSHWAAKU SEED FORMULATION FOLLOWED BY SHATAPUSHPADI GHANAVATI WAS PLANNED. AIMS: TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF VAMANA KARMA (THERAPEUTIC VOMITING) FOLLOWED BY SHATAPUSHPADI GHANAVATI IN THE MANAGEMENT OF AARTAVA KSHAYA (LOSS OF MENSTRUAL FLUID) W. S. R TO PCOS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 15 PATIENTS OF PCOS WERE CLINICALLY DIAGNOSED AND TREATED BY VAMANA KARMA (THERAPEUTIC VOMITING) PROCEDURE WITH IKSHWAAKU SEED FORMULATION. AFTER COMPLETION OF VAMANA KARMA (THERAPEUTIC VOMITING) AND SAMSARJANA KRAMA, (POST THERAPY DIETARY REGIMEN FOR REVIVAL) SHATAPUSHPADI GHANAVATI 2 VATI (EACH 500 MG) TWICE IN A DAY WITH LUKEWARM WATER WAS GIVEN FOR 45 DAYS. AFTER COMPLETION OF 2-MONTH TRIAL, ASSESSMENT OF THERAPY WAS ESTIMATED BY SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE PARAMETERS. RESULTS: STATISTICALLY EXTREMELY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.0001) RESULTS WERE FOUND IN MENSTRUAL IRREGULARITIES, OBESITY, AND BODY MASS INDEX. THE SIGNIFICANT RESULT IN REDUCTION OF NONDOMINANT FOLLICLES (P = 0.01 AND 0.03 FOR RIGHT AND LEFT OVARY, RESPECTIVELY), LOWERING THE FASTING BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL (P = 0.02) AND HIRSUTISM (P = 0.03) WAS FOUND. CONCLUSION: VAMANA KARMA (THERAPEUTIC VOMITING) FOLLOWED BY SHATAPUSHPADI GHANAVATI IS VERY EFFECTIVE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF OBESE PCOS PATIENTS AND INCREASING CHANCES OF CONCEPTION.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
6 1570  26 MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE CALCULUS CHOLECYSTITIS WITH INTEGRATED AYURVEDA AND YOGA INTERVENTION: A CASE REPORT. ACUTE CALCULUS CHOLECYSTITIS (ACC) IS A FREQUENTLY REPORTED MEDICAL CONDITION IN GENERAL PRACTICE. APPROXIMATELY 20% OF PATIENTS WITH GALLBLADDER STONES EXPERIENCE ACC IN THEIR LIFETIME. AYURVEDA AND YOGA ARE ANCIENT TRADITIONAL SYSTEMS OF MEDICINE USED FOR TREATMENT OF DISEASES AND IMPROVING AND MAINTAINING HEALTH. THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASED USE OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SEVERAL HEALTH CONDITIONS IN INDIA AND WORLDWIDE. THE PRESENT CASE STUDY IS OF 34 YEARS FEMALE PATIENT WHO HAD ACC. POST DIAGNOSIS OF ACC PATIENT WAS ADVISED TO UNDERGO CHOLECYSTECTOMY; HOWEVER, SHE APPROACHED ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES WITH C/O VOMITING, NAUSEA, ABDOMINAL PAIN, JAUNDICE, ITCHING, AND ABDOMINAL BLOATING WITH DERANGED LIVER FUNCTIONS. AYURVEDA AND YOGA INTERVENTION PROTOCOL WAS DESIGNED. AYURVEDA TREATMENT CONSISTED OF MILD PURGATION (MRUDUVIRECHANA) WITH TRIVRITTALEHYAM FOR CONSECUTIVE SEVEN DAYS, FOLLOWED BY ORAL ADMINISTRATION OF TAB LIV 52, BHUNIMBADI KADHA TWICE DAILY, AND AMALAKI RASAYANA IN THE MORNING FOR 45 DAYS. PATIENTS RECEIVED 8 TELEYOGA SESSIONS OVER A PERIOD OF 45 DAYS. A THERAPEUTIC DIET WAS ADVISED DURING TREATMENT PERIOD. AFTER TWO MONTHS PATIENT REPORTED COMPLETE RECOVERY IN SYMPTOMS, AND ALL LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS REACHED TO NORMAL RANGE. THIS CASE STUDY SUGGESTS THE POSITIVE ROLE OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA INTERVENTION IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ACC. THIS CASE REPORT WARRANTS FUTURE CLINICAL STUDIES ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE IN ACC.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
7  840  26 EFFECT OF YOGA ON POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME (PCOS) IS NOT A DISEASE BUT A MERE SYNDROME. MANY RESEARCHERS HAVE STUDIED POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME AND FOUND THAT THERE IS NO PROPER CAUSE OF THAT, IT MAY OCCUR DUE TO HORMONAL IMBALANCE OR STRESS, OR DUE TO A SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE. THE RATE OF POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME IN INDIAN WOMEN HAS BEEN INCREASING RAPIDLY. THE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE ACNE, WEIGHT GAIN, HIRSUTISM, DIFFICULTIES IN FERTILITY, IRREGULAR OR INFREQUENT PERIODS, IMMATURE OVARIAN EGGS THAT DO NOT OVULATE, MULTIPLE CYSTS IN THE OVARY. IF LEFT UNTREATED, IT MAY BECOME THE CAUSE FOR HEART DISEASES, DIABETES, HYPERTENSION, INFERTILITY, AND EVEN CANCER. THERE ARE VARIETIES OF MEDICAL TREATMENTS AVAILABLE TO TREAT POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME BUT THEY HAVE A TEMPORARY EFFECT AND IF TAKEN FOR A LONG TIME THEN IT MAY LEAD TO SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS. YOGA HAS PROVEN EFFECTS IN REDUCING AND MANAGING THE SYMPTOMS OF POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME MORE EFFECTIVELY ALONG WITH MEDICINE. THIS REVIEW WORK HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO CONSIDER THE AVAILABLE LITERATURE CONCERNING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME. IT INCLUDES SOME RESEARCH PAPERS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 2012 AND 2019. BY PROVIDING YOGIC TREATMENT EFFECT ON SEVERAL PARAMETERS (SUCH AS BLOOD LIPID LEVEL, GLUCOSE METABOLISM, ENDOCRINE PARAMETERS, QUALITY OF LIFE, RESTING CARDIOVASCULAR PARAMETERS, LEVEL OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION) ON THE WOMAN WITH POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME WERE MEASURED. AFTER THOROUGHLY STUDYING ABOUT 74 RESEARCH PAPERS, 16 ARE FOUND MOST RELEVANT TO BE REVIEWED. THE STUDIES OF THESE PAPERS CONCLUDED THE SUCCESSFUL USE OF DIFFERENT YOGIC LIMBS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME WITH OR WITHOUT MEDICATIONS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
8 1665  31 NATUROPATHY AND YOGA FOR IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE IN PEMPHIGUS VULGARIS AND MANAGING CO-MORBID TYPE 2 DIABETES: A CASE REPORT. A 57 YEARS OLD MALE PATIENT WAS ADMITTED TO AN INPATIENT NATUROPATHY AND YOGA (N&Y) HOSPITAL, DIAGNOSED WITH PEMPHIGUS VULGARIS (PV) FOR ONE YEAR AND CO-MORBID TYPE 2 DIABETES (T2DM) FOR 10 YEARS, ASSOCIATED WITH POOR QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). HE WAS ADMINISTERED N&Y THERAPIES FOR 10 DAYS, ALONG WITH CONVENTIONAL MEDICINES. THERE WAS IMPROVED QOL AND REDUCED DOSAGE OF INSULIN, ALONG WITH REDUCTION IN BODY WEIGHT. THESE CHANGES WERE SUSTAINED AND IMPROVED FURTHER DURING THE 60-DAY FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO IMPROVEMENT IN THE SKIN LESIONS, THE IMPROVEMENT IN QOL INDICATE A POSSIBLE ROLE OF N&Y IN MANAGEMENT OF PV AND T2DM. THIS CASE REPORT ALSO WARRANTS FURTHER STUDIES FOR N&Y IN THE MANAGEMENT OF DERMATOLOGICAL CONDITIONS AS WELL AS METABOLIC SYNDROME.	2020

10  660  27 EFFECT OF 12 WEEKS OF YOGA THERAPY ON QUALITY OF LIFE AND INDIAN DIABETES RISK SCORE IN NORMOTENSIVE INDIAN YOUNG ADULT PREDIABETICS AND DIABETICS: RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: INDIA HAS BECOME THE EPICENTRE FOR DIABETES, A STRESS-RELATED DISORDER AFFECTING THE WORKING SKILLS AND DAY-TO-DAY LIFESTYLE MANAGEMENT OF YOUNGER POPULATION. MOST OF THE STUDIES HAVE REPORTED THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) IN DIABETIC PATIENTS WITH OTHER COMORBIDITIES. TILL DATE, NO RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL REPORTS ARE AVAILABLE TO SHOW THE EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY ON QOL AND INDIAN DIABETES RISK SCORE (IDRS) IN NORMOTENSIVE PREDIABETIC AND DIABETIC YOUNG INDIVIDUALS. AIM: TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF 12 WEEKS OF YOGA THERAPY ON QOL AND IDRS AMONG NORMOTENSIVE PREDIABETIC AND DIABETIC YOUNG INDIAN ADULTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED IN ENDOCRINOLOGY OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENT (OPD). NORMOTENSIVE PARTICIPANTS (N=310) AGED 18-45 YEARS WERE DIVIDED INTO HEALTHY CONTROLS (N=62), PREDIABETICS (N=124) AND DIABETICS (N=124). STUDY GROUP SUBJECTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO GROUP II (N=62, PREDIABETES-STANDARD TREATMENT), GROUP III (N=62, PREDIABETES-STANDARD TREATMENT + YOGA THERAPY), GROUP IV (N=62, DIABETES-STANDARD TREATMENT) AND GROUP V (N=62, DIABETES-STANDARD TREATMENT + YOGA THERAPY). FLANAGAN QOL SCALE, IDRS QUESTIONNAIRE, FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE (FPG) AND INSULIN WERE ASSESSED PRE AND POST 12 WEEKS OF INTERVENTION. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS DONE USING STUDENT'S PAIRED T-TEST AND ONE-WAY ANOVA. RESULTS: PRE-POST INTERVENTION ANALYSIS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN QOL SCALE WITH P<0.01 IN GROUP II AND GROUP IV; P<0.001 IN GROUP III AND GROUP V RESPECTIVELY. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN IDRS IN GROUP II (P<0.05); P<0.001 IN GROUP III, GROUP IV AND GROUP V RESPECTIVELY. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE (P<0.001) IN QOL SCALE AND IDRS WERE FOUND WHEN STUDY GROUPS WITH STANDARD TREATMENT ALONG WITH YOGA THERAPY WERE COMPARED TO STANDARD TREATMENT ALONE. CONCLUSION: YOGA THERAPY ALONG WITH STANDARD TREATMENT FOR 12 WEEKS IMPROVED QOL AND ATTENUATED THE DIABETES RISK AMONG INDIAN PREDIABETICS AND DIABETICS COMPARED TO STANDARD TREATMENT ALONE.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
11  689  30 EFFECT OF AYURVEDA INTERVENTION, LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AND YOGA IN PREDIABETIC AND TYPE 2 DIABETES UNDER THE NATIONAL PROGRAMME FOR PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF CANCER, DIABETES, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES AND STROKE (NPCDCS)-AYUSH INTEGRATION PROJECT. BACKGROUND: TYPE 2 DIABETES IS A LIFESTYLE-RELATED DISORDER THAT AFFECTS AROUND 422 MILLION INDIVIDUALS IN INDIA. INTEGRATION OF AYUSH (AYURVEDA) WITH THE NATIONAL PROGRAMME FOR PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF CANCER, DIABETES, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES AND STROKE (NPCDCS) WAS CONCEIVED ON PILOT BASIS AT GAYA, BIHAR, TO PROVIDE INTEGRATIVE TREATMENT FOR NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASE PATIENTS AND TO MANAGE THE BURDEN OF NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES IN INDIA. OBJECTIVES: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ANALYZE THE EFFECT OF AYURVEDA INTERVENTION, LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AND YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES UNDER NPCDCS-AYUSH INTEGRATION PROJECT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A MULTI-CENTRIC, OPEN-LABELED, PROSPECTIVE, COMPARATIVE CLINICAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT 17 COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS AND 1 DISTRICT HOSPITAL. POPULATION OVER 30 YEARS OF AGE WAS SCREENED AND PREDIABETIC OR TYPE 2 DIABETIC INDIVIDUALS WERE ENROLLED IN TWO COHORTS, I.E., PRE-DIABETIC (COHORT A) AND TYPE 2 DIABETIC (COHORT B). EACH COHORT WAS FURTHER DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: GROUP A1 WAS ADVISED FOR LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AND YOGA AND GROUP A2 WAS GIVEN AYURVEDA MEDICATION IN ADDITION TO LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AND YOGA. SIMILARLY, GROUP B1 WAS ADVISED FOR LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AND YOGA ALONG WITH ALLOPATHIC MEDICATION AND GROUP B2 WAS GIVEN AYURVEDA MEDICATION, I.E., MAMAJJAKA, AMALAKI AND GUDUCHI POWDER IN ADDITION TO LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AND YOGA ALONG WITH ALLOPATHIC MEDICATION. TREATMENT WAS GIVEN FOR 6 MONTHS. DATA WERE ANALYZED THROUGH PAIRED T-TEST. RESULTS: A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION WAS OBSERVED IN FASTING BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL IN GROUPS A2 AND B2 (P = 0.001) AND ALSO IN THE POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL IN GROUPS A2 AND B2 (P = 0.001). FURTHER, IMPROVEMENT IN SUBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS SUCH AS POLYURIA, POLYDIPSIA, POLYPHAGIA, BLURRED VISION AND WEAKNESS WAS FOUND IN ALL THE GROUPS, WHILE NON-HEALING ULCER DOES NOT SHOW ANY IMPROVEMENT. CONCLUSION: THE STUDY REVEALS THAT AYURVEDA INTERVENTION, I.E., MAMAJJAKA CHURNA (1 G), AMALAKI CHURNA (3 G) AND GUDUCHI CHURNA (3 G) TWO TIMES A DAY EFFECTIVELY CONTROLS BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL IN PRE-DIABETIC AND TYPE 2 DIABETIC PATIENTS AND IMPROVES THE DISEASE MANAGEMENT WITH LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AND YOGASANA AS WELL AS WITH ALLOPATHIC TREATMENT.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                       
12  512  28 COMPARATIVE STUDY ON THE EFFECT OF SAPTAMRITA LAUHA AND YOGA THERAPY IN MYOPIA. BACKGROUND: MYOPIA IS VERY COMMON OPHTHALMIC DISEASE ESPECIALLY IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENCE. IN AYURVEDIC TEXTS, ONLY BY THE MAIN FEATURE IMPAIRMENT OF DISTANT VISION MYOPIA CAN BE CORRELATED WITH DRISHTIGATA ROGAS (2(ND) PATALGATA TIMIRA). AIM: TO COMPARE THE EFFECT OF SAPTAMRUTA LAUHA AND YOGA THERAPY IN MYOPIA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IN PRESENT STUDY, A TOTAL 60 PATIENTS WITH AGE GROUP BETWEEN 8 TO 30 YEARS WERE SELECTED RANDOMLY FROM THE OUT-PATIENT DEPARTMENT OF SWASTHAVRITTA AND SHALAKYATANTRA DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT AYURVEDA COLLEGE, TRIVANDRUM, AND WERE DIVIDED IN TWO GROUPS. IN GROUP A, SAPTAMRITA LAUHA 250 MG TWICE DAILY WITH UNEQUAL QUANTITY OF HONEY AND GHRITA WAS ADMINISTERED WHILE IN GROUP B, PATIENTS SUBJECTED TO YOGA THERAPY (JALA NETI, NADI SHODHANA, SHITALI PRANAYAMA AND POINT TRATAK) FOR 3 MONTHS DURATION WITH 1 MONTH FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: THE RESULT OBTAINED FROM THE STUDY REVEALS THAT THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE VISUAL ACUITY AND CLINICAL REFRACTION, BUT ASSOCIATED CHANGES WERE OBSERVED AS REDUCED IN GROUP B WHEN COMPARED TO GROUP A. HOWEVER, RELIEF FROM HEADACHE WAS FOUND TO BE EQUALLY EFFECTIVE IN BOTH THE GROUPS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
13 1476  33 INTEGRATED YOGA AND NATUROPATHY MODULE IN MANAGEMENT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME: A CASE REPORT. A 50-YEAR-OLD MALE PARTICIPANT WITH SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE, DIAGNOSED WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME (METS) [OBESITY, TYPE-2 DIABETES MELLITUS, HYPERTENSION] AND HYPOTHYROIDISM SINCE 2013, WAS ADMINISTERED INTEGRATED YOGA AND NATUROPATHY (IYN) FOR 6 WEEKS AS A TAILOR MADE INDIVIDUALIZED PROTOCOL AT THE RESIDENTIAL INTEGRATIVE MEDICAL FACILITY IN BANGALORE BETWEEN OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER 2015. THE RESULTS SHOWED REDUCTION IN WEIGHT (97.9 KG TO 74.6 KG), BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) (35.1 KG/M(2) TO 27.86 KG/M(2)), TOTAL CHOLESTEROL (192 MG% TO 145 MG%), TRIGLYCERIDES (153 MG% TO 90 MG%), LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (LDL) (124 MG% TO 81 MG%), HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (HDL) (40 MG% TO 46 MG%), FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE (110 MG/DL TO 75 MG/DL), POSTPRANDIAL GLUCOSE (267 MG/DL TO 100 MG/DL), GLYCATED HEMOGLOBIN (HBA1C) (7.8%-7.1%), THYROID STIMULATING HORMONE (TSH) (6.90 MUIU/ML TO 3.052 MUIU/ML). FOLLOWING THE INTERVENTION, THE ANTI-HYPERTENSIVE, ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC, THYROID RAISING AND ANALGESIC MEDICINES WERE NOT REQUIRED TO BE CONTINUED. HIS KNEE PAIN MINIMIZED ON DISCHARGE AS OBSERVED ON A VISUAL ANALOG SCALE. HE HAD AN IMPROVED FEELING OF WELLNESS AND OVERALL FUNCTIONAL HEALTH. ALL HIS PARAMETERS WERE WITHIN NORMAL RANGE AT THE 12-WEEKS FOLLOW-UP, AS HE HAD INCORPORATED THE LIFESTYLE PROGRAM INTO HIS DAILY ROUTINE. THIS CASE REPORT SUGGESTS THAT LIFESTYLE CHANGE BY INTEGRATION OF SPECIFIC NON-DRUG YOGA AND NATUROPATHIC INTERVENTION IS USEFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF METS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
14 1914  23 ROLE OF INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY IN A FAILED POST-TOTAL KNEE REPLACEMENT OF BILATERAL KNEES. OA KNEE IS THE MOST COMMON ARTHRITIS. KNEE REPLACEMENT SURGERIES ARE BEING DONE INCREASINGLY IN THE PRESENT TIMES. THIS HAS LED TO THE VIOLATION OF THE STANDARD INDICATIONS AND WHEN KNEES ARE REPLACED IGNORING OTHER CO - MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS IT RESULTS IN THE SURGERY FAILING EARLY. THIS IS ABOUT A PATIENT WHO ENCOUNTERED A FAILED TKR DUE TO IMPROPER SELECTION AS PATIENT HAD BILATERAL OA HIP THAT WAS IGNORED IN THE INITIAL STAGES. TO OVERCOME THE PROBLEM SHE WAS ADVISED BILATERAL HIP REPLACEMENT WHICH WOULD LEAVE HER WITH FOUR REPLACEMENTS IN THE LOWER LIMB. SHE REFUSED SURGERY AND WAS TOLD THERE ARE NO ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS. THIS PATIENT UNDERWENT A 3 WEEK INTEGRATED COURSE OF IAYT AT OUR CENTER AND SHE MADE A REMARKABLE RECOVERY. IAYT IS A GOOD NON-SURGICAL TREATMENT THAT CAN BE AFFECTIVE BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER KNEE REPLACEMENT AND IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS THE FIRST CHOICE OF TREATMENT BEFORE SURGERY.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
15  213  19 A STUDY OF RESPONSE PATTERN OF NON-INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETICS TO YOGA THERAPY. CHANGES IN BLOOD GLUCOSE AND GLUCOSE TOLERANCE BY ORAL GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST (OGTT) AFTER 40 DAYS OF YOGA THERAPY IN 149 NON-INSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETICS (NIDDM) WERE INVESTIGATED. THE RESPONSE TO YOGA IN THESE SUBJECTS WAS CATEGORIZED ACCORDING TO A SEVERITY SCALE INDEX (SSI) BASED ON AREA INDEX TOTAL (AIT) UNDER OGTT CURVE.

16 1128  32 EFFICACY OF VAMANA KARMA WITH IKSHVAKU KSHEERA YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF TAMAKA SHVASA (BRONCHIAL ASTHMA). INTRODUCTION: BRONCHIAL ASTHMA IS A HIGHLY PREVALENT DISEASE, AND IN MOST OF THE ETIOPATHOGENESIS AND SYMPTOMATOLOGY, IT CAN BE CORRELATED WITH TAMAKA SHVASA. IKSHVAKU (LAGENARIA VULGARIS [MANILA] STANDLEY.) IS AN ANNUAL HERBACEOUS CLIMBING PLANT WITH A LONG HISTORY OF MEDICINAL USES FOR THE TREATMENT OF VARIOUS AILMENTS INCLUDING JAUNDICE, DIABETES, ULCER, PILES, COLITIS, ASTHMA, INSANITY, HYPERTENSION, CONGESTIVE CARDIAC FAILURE AND SKIN DISORDERS. ITS FRUIT PULP IS USED BOTH AS AN EMETIC AND AS A PURGATIVE. AIMS: TO STUDY THE EFFICACY OF VAMANA KARMA WITH IKSHVAKU (LAGENARIA VULGARIS [MANILA] STANDLEY) KSHEERA YOGA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 15 PATIENTS FULFILLING THE DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR BRONCHIAL ASTHMA WERE SELECTED FROM OUTPATIENT AND INPATIENT DEPARTMENT OF PANCHAKARMA DEPARTMENT. THE SIGN AND SYMPTOMS, MAINLY BREATHLESSNESS, COUGH AND RHONCHI WERE GIVEN SCORES DEPENDING ON THEIR SEVERITY. THE PATIENTS WERE ALSO ASSESSED FOR LUNG FUNCTION TEST TO DETERMINE PULMONARY IMPAIRMENT. FOR VAMANA, THEY WERE GIVEN DEEPANA AND PACHANA WITH TRIKATU CHURNA FOR 3 DAYS AND THEN THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO SNEHAPANA WITH LUKEWARM COW'S GHEE. AFTER THE COMPLETION OF SNEHAPANA, THE PATIENT WERE GIVEN ABHYANGA, VASHPA SWEDANA AND DIET WITH PREDOMINANCE OF KAPHA (KAPHA BAHULA AHARA- DIET MIXED WITH MILK OR CURD), WHICH WAS THEN FOLLOWED BY VAMANA WITH IKSHVAKU KSHEERA YOGA AND SAMSARJANA KRAMA. FOLLOW-UP WAS DONE AT AN INTERVAL OF 15 DAYS FOR THREE TIMES AND T SCORES WERE NOTED BEFORE AND AFTER THE TREATMENT. THE SCORES WERE ANALYZED USING WILCOXON SIGNED-RANK TEST FOR SUBJECTIVE PARAMETERS AND STUDENT'S PAIRED T-TEST FOR OBJECTIVE PARAMETERS. RESULTS: THE TRIAL DRUG HAS SHOWN STATISTICALLY HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN BREATHLESSNESS, COUGH, RHONCHI, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN LUNG FUNCTION TESTS. CONCLUSION: THE TEST DRUG PROVED ITS EMETIC EFFECT ON THE PATIENTS OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA AND THUS RELIEVED THE SYMPTOMS OF THE DISEASE IMMEDIATELY. IT HAS REDUCED FREQUENCY OF EPISODES OF BREATHLESSNESS AND SEVERITY OF SYMPTOMS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
17  479  18 CLINICAL EFFECT OF NIRGUNDI PATRA PINDA SWEDA AND ASHWAGANDHADI GUGGULU YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SANDHIGATA VATA (OSTEOARTHRITIS). SANDHIGATA VATA IS ONE AMONG THE 80 NANATMAJA VATA VYADHIES. SANDHIGATA VATA AND OSTEOARTHRITIS HAVE COMMON SYMPTOMS, AND HENCE, BOTH ARE CONSIDERED AS SIMILAR ENTITIES BY A MAJORITY OF AYURVEDIC SCHOLARS AND SAME HAS BEEN ADOPTED HERE. OSTEOARTHRITIS IS THE MOST COMMON JOINT DISEASE AMONG HUMAN BEINGS TODAY. IN THIS STUDY, A TOTAL OF 116 PATIENTS WERE REGISTERED, OUT OF THEM 101 PATIENTS HAD COMPLETED THE FULL COURSE OF TREATMENT, WHILE 15 PATIENTS LEFT AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE. THE 101 PATIENTS OF SANDHIGATA VATA WERE TREATED IN TWO GROUPS. GROUP A: IN THIS GROUP 50 PATIENTS OF SANDHIGATA VATA WERE TREATED WITH NIRGUNDI PATRA PINDA SWEDA FOR 21 DAYS AND ASHWAGANDHADI GUGGULU YOGA3 G/DAY FOR 45 DAYS WAS GIVEN ORALLY. GROUP B: IN THIS GROUP 51 PATIENTS OF SANDHIGATA VATA WERE TREATED WITH ONLY ASHWAGANDHADI GUGGULU YOGA 3 G/DAY FOR 45 DAYS. TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF THE THERAPY OBJECTIVELY, ALL THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF SANDHIGATA VATA WERE GIVEN A SCORE, DEPENDING UPON THEIR SEVERITY. ALSO FUNCTIONAL TESTS LIKE WALKING TIME, CLIMBING STAIRS, AND JOINT MOVEMENT, WERE MEASURED AS A CRITERIA FOR ASSESSMENT. BOTH THE GROUPS SHOWED GOOD RESULTS, BUT GROUP B SHOWED BETTER RESULTS IN COMPARISON TO GROUP A.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
18 1370  32 IMPACT OF A STRUCTURED YOGA PROGRAM ON BLOOD PRESSURE REDUCTION AMONG HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS: STUDY PROTOCOL FOR A PRAGMATIC RANDOMIZED MULTICENTER TRIAL IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE SETTINGS IN NEPAL. BACKGROUND: HYPERTENSION CONTROL REMAINS A MAJOR GLOBAL CHALLENGE. THE BEHAVIORAL APPROACHES RECOMMENDED FOR BLOOD PRESSURE REDUCTION ARE STRESS REDUCTION, INCREASED EXERCISE AND HEALTHY DIETARY HABITS. SOME STUDY FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA HAS A BENEFICIAL EFFECT IN REDUCING BLOOD PRESSURE. HOWEVER, THE ROLE OF YOGA ON BLOOD PRESSURE HAS RECEIVED LITTLE ATTENTION IN EXISTING HEALTH CARE PRACTICES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THIS STUDY WILL BE CONDUCTED IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE FACILITIES IN NEPAL TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A PRAGMATIC YOGA INTERVENTION TO COMPLEMENT STANDARD PRACTICE IN FURTHER REDUCING BLOOD PRESSURE. METHODS: THIS WILL BE MULTICENTRIC, TWO ARMS, RANDOMIZED, NONBLINDED, PRAGMATIC TRIAL. IT WILL BE CONDUCTED IN SEVEN DISTRICT AYURVEDA HEALTH CENTERS (DAHCS) IN NEPAL BETWEEN JULY 2017 AND JUNE 2018. THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS WILL CONSIST OF HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS WITH OR WITHOUT ANTIHYPERTENSIVE MEDICATION ATTENDING TO THE OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENT (OPD). ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY PARTICIPANTS WILL BE RANDOMIZED TO TREATMENT OR CONTROL GROUPS BY USING A STRATIFIED BLOCK RANDOMIZATION. AT THE STUDY SITE, THE TREATMENT ARM PARTICIPANTS WILL RECEIVE AN INTERVENTION CONSISTING OF FIVE DAYS OF STRUCTURED YOGA TRAINING AND PRACTICE OF THE SAME PACKAGE AT HOME WITH A RECOMMENDATION OF FIVE DAYS A WEEK FOR THE FOLLOWING 90 DAYS. BOTH THE INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS WILL RECEIVE TWO HOURS OF HEALTH EDUCATION ON LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME OF THIS TRIAL WILL BE THE CHANGE IN SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND IT WILL BE ASSESSED AFTER 90 DAYS OF THE INTERVENTION. DISCUSSION: THIS STUDY WILL ESTABLISH THE EXTENT TO WHICH A YOGA INTERVENTION PACKAGE CAN HELP REDUCE BLOOD PRESSURE IN HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS. IF PROVEN EFFECTIVE, STUDY FINDINGS MAY BE USED TO RECOMMEND THE GOVERNING BODIES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS FOR THE INTEGRATION OF YOGA IN THE NATIONAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FOR THE TREATMENT AND CONTROL OF HYPERTENSION.

THE CLASSICAL TEXTS OF AYURVEDIC MEDICINE SUCH AS CHARAKA SAMHITA AND SUSHRUTA SAMHITA CONTAIN DESCRIPTIONS OF PANDEMICS OF SIMILAR PROPORTIONS AND DESCRIBE THEM AS JANAPADODDHVANSA, MEANING THE DESTRUCTION OF COMMUNITIES, ALONG WITH THEIR CAUSES AND TREATMENT. CASE PRESENTATION: THE CASE REPORTED HEREIN IS A 55-YEAR-OLD MAN FROM DELHI, INDIA, WITH CONFIRMED (TESTED) COVID-19, WHO FIRST TOOK MWM FOR 7 DAYS BEFORE SEEKING INTEGRATIVE THERAPY. THE PATIENT HAS COMORBIDITIES INCLUDING DM, HTN, HYPOTHYROIDISM AND CKD AND HAD DEVELOPED SYMPTOMS INCLUDING FEVER (WHICH WAS RESOLVED BY THE TIME INTEGRATIVE THERAPY WAS STARTED), SORE THROAT, DRY COUGH, BODY ACHES, WEAKNESS, BAD TASTE AND SMELL, AND HEAVINESS IN THE ABDOMEN. BASED ON THE PATIENT'S SYMPTOMS AND COMORBIDITIES, A TREATMENT PLAN INCLUDING AYURVEDIC MEDICINES, YOGA PROTOCOL, DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS AND LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS WAS PRESCRIBED BY A REGISTERED AYURVEDA DOCTOR AND A YOGA CONSULTANT. THE PATIENT STARTED EXPERIENCING IMPROVEMENT IN ALL THE SYMPTOMS WITHIN 2 DAYS AFTER STARTING THE TREATMENT; HE REPORTED APPROXIMATELY [FORMULA: SEE TEXT] RELIEF FROM THE SYMPTOMS AFTER 5 DAYS, AND ALMOST COMPLETE RELIEF WITHIN 9 DAYS. ALSO, THE BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS (BOTH FASTING BLOOD SUGAR [FBS] AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD SUGAR [PPBS]) EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT AFTER 5 DAYS, AND DECREASED TO WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE WITHIN 12 DAYS. BESIDES RELIEF IN SYMPTOMS, THE PATIENT'S REAL-TIME REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (RT-PCR) TEST DONE ON THE 19TH DAY RETURNED NEGATIVE RESULTS. CONCLUSIONS: INTEGRATIVE THERAPY WAS FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE IN MITIGATING THE SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19 IN THIS PATIENT WITH MULTIPLE COMORBIDITIES. MOREOVER, A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS (NOT UNDER CONTROL WITH MODERN MEDICINE) WAS ALSO ACHIEVED. INTEGRATIVE THERAPY BASED ON THE CLASSICAL TEXTS OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA MAY OFFER A PROMISING AND SCALABLE TREATMENT OPTION FOR COVID-19 PATIENTS. A CASE SERIES OR A SUITABLY DESIGNED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IS NEEDED TO ASSESS ITS EFFICACY.	2021

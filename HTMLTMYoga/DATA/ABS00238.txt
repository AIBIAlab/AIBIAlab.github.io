1  238 75 A THERAPY TO LIVE BY: PUBLIC HEALTH, THE SELF AND NATIONALISM IN THE PRACTICE OF A NORTH INDIAN YOGA SOCIETY. IN THIS ARTICLE I FOCUS ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONCEPTS OF SELF AND HEALTH IN MODERN NORTH INDIA. DRAWING ON FIELD RESEARCH IN A POPULAR YOGA SOCIETY, I ARGUE THAT YOGA THERAPY, AS PRACTICED BY THE BHARATIYA YOG SANSTHAN OF DELHI, PROVIDES A RECONCEPTUALIZATION OF WHAT CAN BE MEANT BY PUBLIC HEALTH. USING STUDIES THAT CHALLENGE BOTH THE ESSENTIALIST AND EPISTEMOLOGICAL FACTICITY OF THE SELF, I SHOW HOW THE DISCOURSE AND PRACTICE OF YOGA IS IMPLICATED IN, AND DERIVED FROM, A COMPLEX SEARCH FOR SELF DEFINITION IN TERMS OF HEALTH; HEALTH WHICH IS CONCEIVED OF AS A PUBLIC REGIMEN THAT SEEKS TO RECONNECT THAT WHICH MODERNITY HAS BROKEN APART: MIND AND BODY.	1997

THE AUTHOR GIVES AN ACCOUNT OF HIS EXPERIENCE WITH THE APPLICATION OF YOGA IN PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG RELATED PROBLEMS, IN PSYCHOSOMATIC MEDICINE, SEXUOLOGY, TREATMENT OF NEUROSES, IN GERONTOPSYCHIATRY ETC. THE PROBLEM WHEN USING YOGA IN PSYCHIATRY IS ACTIVE COOPERATION; SYSTEMIC INTERACTIONS MUST BE FORESEEN, IT IS IMPORTANT TO WARN AGAINST COMPETITIVENESS AND SPECIFIC INDICATIONS AND CONTRAINDICATIONS OF DIFFERENT YOGA EXERCISES MUST BE RESPECTED. YOGA IS ALSO A SUITABLE ELEMENT OF PREVENTION OF PROFESSIONAL STRESS IN THE HEALTH SERVICES.	1994

8 1735 24 PHENOMENOLOGICAL INQUIRY INTO PHOENIX RISING YOGA THERAPY. THERE IS GROWING RECOGNITION WITHIN PSYCHOLOGY AND OTHER DISCIPLINES THAT BODY EXPERIENCE MAY BE AS IMPORTANT AS COGNITIVE AND EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE. HOWEVER, PSYCHOLOGY HAS FEW PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS TO SUPPORT THE INTEGRATION OF MIND AND BODY WITHIN THERAPY. PHOENIX RISING YOGA THERAPY (PRYT) IS A FORM OF MIND-BODY THERAPY THAT USES YOGA POSTURE, TOUCH, AND PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC DIALOGUE TO FACILITATE GROWTH AND HEALING. THE CURRENT STUDY EXPLORED THE PHENOMENOLOGICAL EXPERIENCE OF FOUR WOMEN WHO EACH RECEIVED FIVE PRYT SESSIONS. RESEARCH QUESTIONS POSED WERE: (1) WHAT ARE THE CLIENTS' EXPERIENCES OF THE PHENOMENA OF PRYT? AND (2) HOW DOES RECEIVING PRYT SESSIONS IMPACT THE CLIENTS' LIVES? THE FOLLOWING THEMES EMERGED FROM THE DATA AS THE ESSENCE OF PRYT SESSIONS: MINDFULNESS, SELF-AWARENESS, MIND-BODY CONNECTION, IN VIVO EXPERIENCE OF NEW BEHAVIORS, CLIENT-DIRECTED, EMPOWERMENT, AND LIFE CHANGES. THESE THEMES SHOW SIGNIFICANCE IN THE MIND-BODY CONNECTION AND THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE MODALITIES SUCH AS PRYT FOR CLIENTS. EACH PARTICIPANT NOTED GREATER INSIGHT INTO MIND-BODY CONNECTION. THEY NOTICED THE EFFECT OF COGNITION AND EMOTION ON THE BODY, OBSERVED HOW THE BODY CAN BE USED TO IMPROVE COPING THROUGH MOVEMENT AND BREATHING, AND EXPERIENCED DIFFERENT THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT AREAS OF THEIR BODIES. ALTHOUGH THESE RESULTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY GENERALIZABLE, THEY OFFER INTERESTING THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR EMBODIED INTERVENTIONS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
9 2239 18 THE IMPORTANCE OF RESEARCH LITERACY FOR YOGA THERAPISTS. EVIDENCE-INFORMED PRACTICE (EIP) UTILIZES THE THREE COMPONENTS OF EXPERT OPINION, RESEARCH EVIDENCE, AND CLIENT VALUES. IT IS A RECOMMENDED TRAINING COMPETENCY FOR INTEGRATIVE HEALTH PRACTITIONERS IN DIVERSE FIELDS, SUCH AS ACUPUNCTURE AND MASSAGE THERAPY. RESEARCH LITERACY (RL) IS A NECESSARY PRE-REQUISITE TO EIP. MANY YOGA THERAPISTS HAVE LIMITED TRAINING IN THESE SKILLS, WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTS INTER-PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION, AS WELL AS FURTHER ADVANCEMENT OF YOGA THERAPY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE PROPOSE INCLUSION OF RL AND EIP IN THE TRAINING OF YOGA THERAPISTS. BENEFITS FOR CLIENT CARE, COLLABORATIVE CARE, AND THE FIELD OF YOGA THERAPY ARE DISCUSSED.	2017

IN UPSHOT, THE CLINICIANS IN THE FIELD OF MENTAL HEALTH CARE HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED TO INCORPORATE THESE TWO VIEWPOINTS IN THEIR INTERVENTION PROGRAM, AT LEAST, FOR THE MUSLIM PATIENTS FOR A MORE DESIRABLE OUTCOME.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
11 2909 19 [PHYSIOPHILOSOPHICAL FUNDAMENTALS AND GENESIS OF TSIGUN, INDIAN, AND TIBETAN YOGA. PARAMOUNT EMPIRICAL EFFICACY]. THIS ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSIOPHILOSOPHICAL FUNDAMENTALS AND GENESIS OF TSIGUN, INDIAN, AND TIBETAN YOGA BASED ON THE OVERVIEW OF THE RELEVANT LITERATURE WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE METHODOLOGY OF THESE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL DISCIPLINES AND THEIR THERAPEUTIC AND HEALTH-GIVING EFFICACY. BASED ON THE COMBINATION OF PHYSIOPHILOSOPHICAL CATEGORIES AND MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE CONCEPT OF THE FIVE PRIMARY ELEMENTS, THE AUTHORS ILLUSTRATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEMIC APPROACH BY WHICH ANCIENT PHYSICIANS RELATED MAN TO NATURE IN ORDER TO DERIVE THE ADAPTATION PRINCIPLE REALIZED THROUGH HUMAN ACTIVITIES. TRADITIONAL AND MODERN ASPECTS OF THESE ACTIVITIES ARE CONSIDERED. IN THE TRADITIONAL CONTEXT, THE PERFORMANCE OF EXERCISES AS ASSIGNED BY TSIGUN, INDIAN, AND TIBETAN YOGA IS CONSIDERED AS THE PURPOSEFUL REALIZATION OF THE ENERGY OF CONSCIENCE FOR HEALTH IMPROVEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT AND IN THE MODERN CONTEXT AS THE REALIZATION OF A NOVEL FORM OF PSYCHIC CREATIVE CAPACITY TO THE SAME EFFECT BASED ON FRUITFUL BRAINWORK.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
12 2913 18 [RELATION BETWEEN YOGA AND PSYCHOTHERAPY]. WESTERN PSYCHOTHERAPY AND YOGA OVERLAP INSOFAR AS BOTH SYSTEMS ARE BASED UPON RELIGIOUS AND MYTHOLOGICAL FACTS, AND--ON THE LEVEL OF PSYCHOTHERAPEUTICAL PRAXIS--ON THE TECHNICS OF HYPNOSIS, AUTO- AND HETEROSUGGESTIONS AND/OR MEDITATION. IT IS 50 YEARS AGO THAT THE WEST CONSIDERED THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTICAL EFFECTS OF THEAYOGA-SYSTEMS, FIRST OF ALL OF HATHA- YOGA. EVEN TODAY A THEORETICAL FOUNDATION BY MEANS OF PROPER COMPARISON OF THE TWO STRUCTURES IS MISSING. IN PRESENT-DAY INDIA YOGA FULFILLS PSYCHOHYGIENICAL FUNCTIONS WITHOUT BEING A PSYCHOTHERAPY IN OUR SENSE. THERE ARE VARIOUS TECHNIQUES OF MAGIC IN USE, WHICH REPLACE THE EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGICAL-PSYCHOTHERAPEUTICAL METHODS IN THE WEST. THE ACCEPTANCE OF MEDITATION COULD ONLY BE SUCCESSFUL IF THE METAPHYSICAL AND SOCIOCULTURAL CONTEXT WOULD BE INTEGRATED AT THE SAME TIME. THE TRADITIONAL FUNCTION OF YOGA GUARANTEES ITS CONTINUITY EVEN IN THE MODERN INDUSTRIALIZED SOCIETY OF INDIA. NEITHER THE THEORETICAL NOR THE PRATICAL FUNDAMENTS ALLOW A DIRECT TRANSFER AT PRESENT.	1980	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
13 1475 13 INTEGRATED APPROACH TO YOGA. YOGA IS A SCIENCE OF HOLISTIC LIVING AND NOT MERELY A SET OF ASANAS AND PRANAYAMA. IT IS A PSYCHO PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL SCIENCE, WHICH AIMS AT THE HARMONIOUS DEVELOPMENT OF THE HUMAN BODY, MIND AND SOUL. YOGA IS THE CONSCIOUS ART OF SELF-DISCOVERY. IT IS A PROCESS BY WHICH ANIMAL MAN ASCENDS THROUGH THE STAGES FROM NORMAL MAN TO SUPER MAN AND THEN THE DIVINE MAN. IT IS AN EXPANSION OF THE NARROW CONSTRICTED EGOISTIC PERSONALITY TO AN ALL-PERVASIVE ETERNAL AND BLISSFUL STATE OF REALITY. YOGA IS AN ALL ROUND DEVELOPMENT OF PERSONALITY AT PHYSICAL, MENTAL INTELLECTUAL, EMOTIONAL AND SPIRITUAL LEVEL.	2000	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
14 1310 25 HEALING MYTHS, YOGA STYLES AND SOCIAL BODIES: SOCIO-LOGICS OF YOGA AS A HEALTH PRACTICE IN THE SOCIALLY STRATIFIED CITY OF MARSEILLE, FRANCE. DRAWING ON PARTICIPANT OBSERVATION AND INTERVIEWS IN TWO YOGA STUDIOS IN THE HIGHLY SOCIALLY STRATIFIED CITY OF MARSEILLE, FRANCE, THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE UNDERSTANDINGS OF YOGA AS A HEALTH PRACTICE THAT EMERGE AT THE INTERSECTIONS BETWEEN YOGA STYLES AND THEIR SOCIAL CONTEXTS OF CONSUMPTION. ITS INSIGHTS EMERGE FROM THE COMPARISON OF THREE MODERN YOGA STYLES THAT WERE DEVELOPED FOR WESTERN ENGLISH-SPEAKING CULTURAL CONTEXTS - IYENGAR, BIKRAM AND FORREST - AND WHICH DIFFER IN FORM BUT ALSO IN THE CHRONOLOGY OF THEIR EMERGENCE ON THE GLOBAL YOGA MARKET AND THAT OF THEIR RECEPTION IN FRANCE. THESE THREE YOGA STYLES ARE ALSO BRANDED THROUGH CONTRASTING MYTHOLOGIES OF TRANSFORMATIONAL HEALING, AND THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXPLORE HOW A BRAND CONCEPTUALIZATION OF YOGA AS A HEALTH PRACTICE RELATES TO OR RESONATES WITH THE EMBODIED EXPERIENCES OF PRACTITIONERS, AND TO THE SOCIO-CULTURAL CONTEXTS IN WHICH PRACTITIONERS AND THEIR PRACTICES ARE EMBEDDED. THE PAPER CONTRIBUTES A NEW CASE STUDY TO THE GLOBAL YOGA SCHOLARSHIP AND TO A POORLY STUDIED FRENCH YOGA SCENE, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT CROSS-EXAMINES THE DISCOURSES THROUGH WHICH A YOGA STYLE IS BRANDED, THE WAY IT IS TRANSMITTED, AND THE SOCIAL CONTEXT AND SOCIAL POSITIONING OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO PRACTICE IT. COMBINING PERSPECTIVES ON THE BODY, NARRATIVE AND RITUALS, IT IDENTIFIES HOW YOGA HEALING IS CONSTRUED IN RELATION TO GENDER, ETHNICITY AND CLASS AND THE POINTS OF CONSENSUS AND DISSENT THAT EMERGE FROM THE ENCOUNTERS BETWEEN FRENCH SOCIAL BODIES AND EXOGENOUS YOGA STYLES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
15 1493 17 INTERPRETIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF A LAWSUIT CONTENDING THAT SCHOOL-BASED YOGA IS RELIGION: A STUDY OF SCHOOL PERSONNEL. THIS STUDY FOCUSED ON THE PERSPECTIVES OF SCHOOL PERSONNEL AFFILIATED WITH THE ENCINITAS UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA FOLLOWING A LAWSUIT ARGUING THAT THEIR YOGA-BASED PROGRAM INCLUDED RELIGION AND THEREFORE WAS UNSUITABLE FOR IMPLEMENTATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. PARTICIPANTS (N = 32) WERE INTERVIEWED USING A SEMISTRUCTURED INTERVIEW, AND DATA WERE ANALYZED ACCORDING TO INTERPRETATIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL ANALYSIS. FIVE SUPER-ORDINATE THEMES (INCLUDING SUB-THEMES) WERE IDENTIFIED IN AN ITERATIVE PROCESS, INCLUDING: PARTICIPANTS' PERSPECTIVES ON THE ROOTS OF YOGA AND THE TYPE OF YOGA TAUGHT IN THEIR DISTRICT; THE PROCESS OF INTRODUCING A YOGA-IN-THE-SCHOOLS PROGRAM IN LIGHT OF THIS CONTENTION (INCLUDING CHALLENGES AND OBSTACLES, AND HOW THESE WERE MET); PERSPECTIVES ON THE LAWSUIT AND HOW THE PROCESS UNFOLDED; EFFECTS OF THE LAWSUIT ON SCHOOL CLIMATE AND BEYOND; AND PERSPECTIVES ON YOGA AS, AND AS NOT, RELIGIOUS. THE STUDY ATTEMPTS TO SHED LIGHT ON THE IMPACT OF AN ONGOING LAWSUIT ON A SCHOOL DISTRICT AT THE TIME OF IMPLEMENTATION OF A PROGRAM FOR STUDENTS' WELL BEING.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
16 2378 19 WHY AYURVEDIC YOGA THERAPISTS AND WHY NOW? IAYT HAS PAVED THE WAY FOR YOGA THERAPY AS A HEALING PROFESSION TO GROW AND DEVELOP ITS MISSION TO DELIVER OPTIMAL THERAPEUTICS VIA INDIVIDUAL SESSIONS AND TAILORED GROUP CLASSES. FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS, THE NATIONAL AYURVEDIC MEDICAL ASSOCIATION (NAMA) HAS BEEN WORKING BEHIND THE SCENES TO CONSIDER THE VALUE AND DEFINITION OF AN AYURVEDIC YOGA THERAPIST (AYT) PROFESSIONAL DESIGNATION WITHIN THE YOGA THERAPY DISCIPLINE. THE AYT DESIGNATION WOULD COMPLEMENT THE CURRENT STANDARDS FOR YOGA THERAPISTS THAT HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED BY IAYT. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO DISCUSS (1) WHY THE AYT DESIGNATION IS IMPORTANT; (2) HOW IT SUPPORTS AND EXPANDS ON IAYT'S MISSION; AND (3) WHY NOW IS THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO DEVELOP COMPETENCIES, STANDARDS, AND A SCOPE OF PRACTICE FOR AYURVEDIC YOGA THERAPY.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
17  367 19 ASTHMA: THE YOGA PERSPECTIVE. PART II: YOGA THERAPY IN THE TREATMENT OF ASTHMA. THE INTEGRAL YOGA APPROACH TO ASTHMA (AND OTHER PSYCHOSOMATIC DISORDERS) IS BRIEFLY OUTLINED AS MEETING ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR AN OPTIMAL, HOLISTIC, SOMATOPSYCHIC THERAPY (AS OUTLINED IN PART I), INCLUDING CORRECTION OF DISTORTED POSTURE AND FAULTY BREATHING HABITS, TEACHING A SYSTEM OF GENERAL MUSCLE RELAXATION, TECHNIQUES FOR THE RELEASE OF SUPPRESSED EMOTION AND FOR REDUCING ANXIETY AND SELF-CONSCIOUS AWARENESS, AS WELL AS SPECIAL METHODS FOR THE EXPECTORATION OF MUCUS. YOGA PRACTICES ARE DESCRIBED IN DETAIL AND THE AVAILABLE PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL RESEARCH ON YOGA PRACTICE, AS WELL AS CLINICAL-THERAPEUTIC STUDIES ON YOGA AS ASTHMATIC THERAPY, ARE REVIEWED. IT CAN THEREFORE BE CONCLUDED THAT YOGA THERAPY IS MOST EFFECTIVE WITH ASTHMA.	1982	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
18  485 14 CLINICAL GROUP SUPERVISION IN YOGA THERAPY: MODEL EFFECTS, AND LESSONS LEARNED. CLINICAL SUPERVISION IS AN INTEGRAL COMPONENT OF THERAPIST TRAINING AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE OF ITS CAPACITY FOR FOSTERING KNOWLEDGE, SELF-AWARENESS, AND CLINICAL ACUMEN. INDIVIDUAL SUPERVISION IS PART OF MANY YOGA THERAPY TRAINING PROGRAMS AND IS REFERENCED IN THE IAYT STANDARDS AS "MENTORING." GROUP SUPERVISION IS NOT TYPICALLY USED IN THE TRAINING OF YOGA THERAPISTS. WE PROPOSE THAT GROUP SUPERVISION EFFECTIVELY SUPPORTS THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF YOGA THERAPISTS-IN-TRAINING. WE PRESENT A MODEL OF GROUP SUPERVISION FOR YOGA THERAPIST TRAINEES DEVELOPED BY THE NEW ENGLAND SCHOOL OF INTEGRATIVE YOGA THERAPEUTICS (THE NESIYT MODEL) THAT INCLUDES THE BACKGROUND, STRUCTURE, FORMAT, AND DEVELOPMENT OF OUR INAUGURAL 18-MONTH SUPERVISION GROUP. PRE-AND POST-SUPERVISION SURVEYS AND ANALYZED CASE NOTES, WHICH CAPTURED KEY DIDACTIC AND PROCESS THEMES, ARE DISCUSSED. CLINICAL ISSUES, SUCH AS BOUNDARIES, PERFORMANCE ANXIETY, SENSE OF SELF EFFICACY, THE THERAPEUTIC ALLIANCE, TRANSFERENCE AND COUNTER TRANSFERENCE, PACING OF YOGA THERAPY SESSIONS, EVALUATION OF CLIENT PROGRESS, AND ADJUNCT THERAPIST INTERACTION ARE REVIEWED. THE TIMING AND SEQUENCE OF DIDACTIC AND PROCESS THEMES AND BENEFITS FOR YOGA THERAPIST TRAINEES' PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, ARE DISCUSSED. THE NESIYT GROUP SUPERVISION MODEL IS OFFERED AS AN EFFECTIVE BLUEPRINT FOR YOGA THERAPY TRAINING PROGRAMS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
19 1678 19 OLDER WOMEN, EXERCISE TO MUSIC, AND YOGA: SENSES OF PLEASURE? THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE LIVED EXPERIENCE OF OLDER WOMEN PARTICIPANTS IN (A) A LOW-IMPACT EXERCISE TO MUSIC (ETM) CLASS AND (B) A YOGA CLASS TO UNCOVER WHAT IS IMPORTANT FOR THEM IN TAKING PART IN THESE CLASSES. RESEARCHER S IS THE INSTRUCTOR OF THE ETM GROUP AND DRAWS UPON INDIVIDUAL AND FOCUS GROUP INTERVIEWS AND PARTICIPANT OBSERVATION. RESEARCHER B IS A MEMBER OF THE YOGA CLASS WHERE SHE INTERVIEWED THE WOMEN AND UNDERTOOK PARTICIPANT OBSERVATIONS. BOTH AUTHORS ARE A SIMILAR AGE TO THE OLDER WOMEN INTERVIEWEES. THROUGH A PHENOMENOLOGICAL INTERPRETATIVE APPROACH, THE PAPER EXAMINES THE WOMEN'S PERCEPTIONS OF THEIR EXERCISE CLASS AND YOGA EXPERIENCES, HIGHLIGHTING PLEASURABLE EXPERIENCES AND FEATURES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THIS ENJOYMENT. THE PAPER CONSIDERS RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PLEASURE, WELLBEING, THE SENSES, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND AGING, DRAWING UPON A VARIETY OF ANALYSES. IT PAYS ATTENTION TO THE CONTEXTUAL FEATURES OF THE ETM AND YOGA CLASSES IN MAKING AVAILABLE AND ACCESSIBLE PLEASURABLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY EXPERIENCES FOR THE WOMEN AND DRAWS, IN PART, ON 'TYPOLOGIES' OF PLEASURE TO FRAME THE DEBATE AROUND OLDER WOMEN, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND SENSES OF PLEASURE. OUR RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS THE CONSIDERABLE WELLBEING AFFECTS FOR WOMEN WHEN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PROVISION TAKES ACCOUNT OF CONTEXT (THE SPATIAL, CULTURAL, SOCIAL, AND SENTIENT).	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
20 2554 26 YOGA FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE'S MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING: RESEARCH REVIEW AND REFLECTIONS ON THE MENTAL HEALTH POTENTIALS OF YOGA. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES YOGA AS A POTENTIAL TOOL FOR CHILDREN TO DEAL WITH STRESS AND REGULATE THEMSELVES. YOGA PROVIDES TRAINING OF MIND AND BODY TO BRING EMOTIONAL BALANCE. WE ARGUE THAT CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE NEED SUCH TOOLS TO LISTEN INWARD TO THEIR BODIES, FEELINGS, AND IDEAS. YOGA MAY ASSIST THEM IN DEVELOPING IN SOUND WAYS, TO STRENGTHEN THEMSELVES, AND BE CONTRIBUTING SOCIAL BEINGS. FIRST, WE ADDRESS HOW CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE IN TODAY'S WORLD FACE NUMEROUS EXPECTATIONS AND CONSTANT STIMULATION THROUGH THE INTERNET AND OTHER MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES. ONE REASON WHY CHILDREN EXPERIENCE STRESS AND MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES IS THAT GLOBALIZATION EXPOSES THE YOUTH ALL OVER THE WORLD TO VARIOUS NEW DEMANDS, STANDARDS, AND OPTIONS. THERE IS ALSO INCREASED PRESSURE TO SUCCEED IN SCHOOL, PARTLY DUE TO INCREASED COMPETITION BUT ALSO A DIVERSE RANGE OF OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN CONTEMPORARY TIMES THAN IN THE PAST. OUR ARGUMENT ALSO PARTIALLY RESTS ON THE FACT THAT MODERN SOCIETY OFFERS PLENTY OF DISTRACTIONS AND UNWELCOME ATTRACTIONS, ESPECIALLY LINKED TO NEW MEDIA TECHNOLOGIES. THE DOMINANT PRESENCE OF MULTIMEDIA DEVICES AND THE TIME SPENT ON THEM BY CHILDREN ARE CLEAR INDICATORS OF THE SHIFT IN LIFESTYLES AND PRIORITIES OF OUR NEW GENERATION. WHILE THESE MEDIA TECHNOLOGIES ARE VALUABLE RESOURCES IN CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE'S LIVES FOR COMMUNICATION, LEARNING, AND ENTERTAINMENT, THEY ALSO RESULT IN CONSTANT COMPETITION FOR YOUNGSTER'S ATTENTION. A MAIN CONCEPT IN OUR ARTICLE IS THAT YOGA MAY HELP CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE COPE WITH STRESS AND THUS, CONTRIBUTE POSITIVELY TO BALANCE IN LIFE, WELL-BEING, AND MENTAL HEALTH. WE PRESENT RESEARCH LITERATURE SUGGESTING THAT YOGA IMPROVES CHILDREN'S PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WELL-BEING. SIMILARLY, YOGA IN SCHOOLS HELPS STUDENTS IMPROVE RESILIENCE, MOOD, AND SELF-REGULATION SKILLS PERTAINING TO EMOTIONS AND STRESS.	2014

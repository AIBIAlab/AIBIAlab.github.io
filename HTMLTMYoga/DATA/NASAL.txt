1  699 110 EFFECT OF HATHA YOGA TRAINING ON RHINITIS SYMPTOMS AND CYTOKINES IN ALLERGIC RHINITIS PATIENTS. INTRODUCTION: ALLERGIC RHINITIS IS AN INFLAMMATION OF THE NASAL MUCOSA IN RESPONSE TO ALLERGENS. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT YOGA CAN IMPROVE PERSONAL HEALTH AND HAS POSITIVE EFFECTS ON IMMUNE FUNCTION. HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA TRAINING ON RHINITIS SYMPTOMS AND CYTOKINES IN PATIENTS WITH ALLERGIC RHINITIS ARE STILL UNCLEAR. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA TRAINING ON RHINITIS SYMPTOMS AND CYTOKINES IN ALLERGIC RHINITIS PATIENTS. METHODS: TWENTY-SEVEN ALLERGIC RHINITIS PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO 2 GROUPS: A CONTROL GROUP (CON; N = 14) AND A YOGA GROUP (YOG; N = 13). THE CON GROUP CONTINUED WITH NORMAL ACTIVITIES AND THE YOG GROUP WAS REQUIRED TO COMPLETE A PROTOCOL OF HATHA YOGA TRAINING FOR 60 MINUTES PER SESSION, 3 TIMES PER WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS. PHYSIOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS, ALLERGIC RHINITIS SYMPTOMS, AND CYTOKINE SECRETIONS WERE COMPARATIVELY ANALYZED BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA TRAINING. RESULTS: AFTER 8 WEEKS, THE YOG GROUP HAD INCREASED PEAK NASAL INSPIRATORY FLOW (PNIF) AND EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED RHINITIS SYMPTOMS AND NASAL BLOOD FLOW (NBF) COMPARED TO PRE-TEST. MOREOVER, THE YOG GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NASAL SECRETION OF INTERLEUKIN (IL)-2 THAN THE CON GROUP. CONCLUSION: THE PRESENT FINDINGS DEMONSTRATED THAT 8 WEEKS OF HATHA YOGA TRAINING HAD BENEFICIAL EFFECTS IN ALLERGIC RHINITIS BY IMPROVED CLINICAL ALLERGIC RHINITIS AND CYTOKINE PROFILES.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
2  770  30 EFFECT OF UNINOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING ON BRAIN HEMODYNAMICS: A FUNCTIONAL NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY STUDY. OBJECTIVES: TO MEASURE THE EFFECT OF THE RIGHT AND LEFT NOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING ON FRONTAL HEMODYNAMIC RESPONSES IN 32 RIGHT HANDED HEALTHY MALE SUBJECTS WITHIN THE AGE RANGE OF 18-35 YEARS (23.75 +/- 4.14 YEARS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: EACH SUBJECT PRACTICED RIGHT NOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING (RNYB), LEFT NOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING (LNYB) OR BREATH AWARENESS (BA) (AS CONTROL) FOR 10 MIN AT THE SAME TIME OF THE DAY FOR THREE CONSECUTIVE DAYS, RESPECTIVELY. THE SEQUENCE OF INTERVENTION WAS ASSIGNED RANDOMLY. THE FRONTAL HEMODYNAMIC RESPONSE IN TERMS OF CHANGES IN THE OXYGENATED HEMOGLOBIN (OXYHB), DEOXYGENATED HEMOGLOBIN (DEOXYHB), AND TOTAL HEMOGLOBIN (TOTALHB OR BLOOD VOLUME) CONCENTRATION WAS TAPPED FOR 5 MIN BEFORE (PRE) AND 10 MIN DURING THE BREATHING PRACTICES USING A 16 CHANNEL FUNCTIONAL NEAR-INFRARED SYSTEM (FNIR100-ACK-W, BIOPAC SYSTEMS, INC., U.S.A.). AVERAGE OF THE EIGHT CHANNELS ON EACH SIDE (RIGHT AND LEFT FRONTALS) WAS OBTAINED FOR THE TWO SESSIONS (PRE AND DURING). DATA WAS ANALYZED USING SPSS VERSION 10.0 THROUGH PAIRED AND INDEPENDENT SAMPLES T-TEST. RESULTS: WITHIN GROUP COMPARISON SHOWED THAT DURING RNYB, OXYHB LEVELS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE LEFT PREFRONTAL CORTEX (PFC) AS COMPARED TO THE BASELINE (P = 0.026). LNYB SHOWED A TREND TOWARDS SIGNIFICANCE FOR REDUCTION IN OXYHB IN THE RIGHT HEMISPHERE (P = 0.057). WHEREAS BA CAUSED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DEOXYHB (P = 0.023) IN THE LEFT HEMISPHERE. BETWEEN GROUPS COMPARISON REVEALED THAT OXYHB AND BLOOD VOLUME IN THE LEFT PFC INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING RNYB AS COMPARED TO BA (OXYHB: P =0.012; TOTALHB: P =0.017) AND LNYB (OXYHB: P =0.024; TOTALHB: P =0.034). CONCLUSION: RNYB INCREASED OXYGENATION AND BLOOD VOLUME IN THE LEFT PFC AS COMPARED TO BA AND LNYB. THIS SUPPORTS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NASAL CYCLE AND ULTRADIAN RHYTHM OF CEREBRAL DOMINANCE AND SUGGESTS A POSSIBLE APPLICATION OF UNINOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PSYCHOPATHOLOGICAL STATES WHICH SHOW LATERALIZED CEREBRAL DYSFUNCTIONS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
3 1273  35 FRONTAL HEMODYNAMIC RESPONSES TO HIGH FREQUENCY YOGA BREATHING IN SCHIZOPHRENIA: A FUNCTIONAL NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY STUDY. FRONTAL HEMODYNAMIC RESPONSES TO HIGH FREQUENCY YOGA BREATHING TECHNIQUE, KAPALABHATI (KB), WERE COMPARED BETWEEN PATIENTS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA (N = 18; 14 MALES, 4 FEMALES) AND AGE, GENDER, AND EDUCATION MATCHED HEALTHY SUBJECTS (N = 18; 14 MALES, 4 FEMALES) USING FUNCTIONAL NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY. THE DIAGNOSIS WAS CONFIRMED BY A PSYCHIATRIST USING DSM-IV. ALL PATIENTS EXCEPT ONE RECEIVED ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS (ONE WAS ON TYPICAL). THEY HAD OBTAINED A STABILIZED STATE AS EVIDENCED BY A STEADY UNCHANGED MEDICATION FROM THEIR PSYCHIATRIST FOR THE PAST 3 MONTHS OR LONGER. THEY LEARNED KB, AMONG OTHER YOGA PROCEDURES, IN A YOGA RETREAT. KB WAS PRACTICED AT THE RATE OF 120 TIMES/MIN FOR 1 MIN. HEALTHY SUBJECTS WHO WERE FRESHLY LEARNING YOGA TOO WERE TAUGHT KB. BOTH THE GROUPS HAD NO PREVIOUS EXPOSURE TO KB PRACTICE AND THE TRAINING WAS CARRIED OUT OVER 2 WEEKS. A CHEST PRESSURE TRANSDUCER WAS USED TO MONITOR THE FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY OF THE PRACTICE OBJECTIVELY. THE FRONTAL HEMODYNAMIC RESPONSE IN TERMS OF THE OXYGENATED HEMOGLOBIN (OXYHB), DEOXYGENATED HEMOGLOBIN (DEOXYHB), AND TOTAL HEMOGLOBIN (TOTALHB) OR BLOOD VOLUME CONCENTRATION WAS TAPPED FOR 5 MIN BEFORE, 1 MIN DURING, AND FOR 5 MIN AFTER KB. THIS WAS OBTAINED IN A QUIET ROOM USING A 16-CHANNEL FUNCTIONAL NEAR-INFRARED SYSTEM (FNIR100-ACK-W, BIOPAC SYSTEMS, INC., USA). THE AVERAGE OF THE EIGHT CHANNELS FOR EACH SIDE (RIGHT AND LEFT FRONTALS) WAS OBTAINED FOR THE THREE SESSIONS. THE CHANGES IN THE LEVELS OF OXYHB, DEOXYHB, AND BLOOD VOLUME FOR THE THREE SESSIONS WERE COMPARED BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS USING INDEPENDENT SAMPLES T-TEST. WITHIN GROUP COMPARISON SHOWED THAT THE INCREASE IN BILATERAL OXYHB AND TOTALHB FROM THE BASELINE WAS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT IN HEALTHY CONTROLS DURING KB (RIGHT OXYHB, P = 0.00; LEFT OXYHB, P = 0.00 AND RIGHT TOTALHB, P = 0.01; LEFT TOTALHB, P = 0.00), WHEREAS SCHIZOPHRENIA PATIENTS DID NOT SHOW ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE SAME ON BOTH THE SIDES. ON THE OTHER HAND, SCHIZOPHRENIA PATIENTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DEOXYHB IN THE RIGHT PRE-FRONTAL CORTEX (RIGHT DEOXYHB, P = 0.00). COMPARISON BETWEEN THE GROUPS SHOWED THAT SCHIZOPHRENIA PATIENTS HAVE REDUCED BILATERAL PRE-FRONTAL ACTIVATION (RIGHT OXYHB, P = 0.01; LEFT OXYHB, P = 0.03 AND RIGHT TOTAL HB, P = 0.03; LEFT TOTAL HB, P = 0.04) DURING KB AS COMPARED TO HEALTHY CONTROLS. THIS HYPO-FRONTALITY OF SCHIZOPHRENIA PATIENTS IN RESPONSE TO KB MAY BE USED CLINICALLY TO SUPPORT THE DIAGNOSIS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA IN FUTURE.	2014	

4 1376  37 IMPACT OF HATHA YOGA ON THE AIRWAY RESISTANCES IN HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS AND ALLERGIC RHINITIS PATIENTS. THERE HAVE BEEN LIMITED STUDIES ON HATHA YOGA TRAINING AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY TO MANAGE THE SYMPTOMS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS. THE MAIN AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO CHECK THE IMPACT OF HATHA YOGASANAS ON THE AIRWAY RESISTANCES IN HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS, A BASELINE DATA CAN BE ESTABLISHED AND ALSO TO STUDY THE IMPACT OF HATHA YOGASANAS ON THE AIRWAY RESISTANCES IN ALLERGIC RHINITIS PATIENTS IN BANGALORE, INDIA. THIS IS A PROSPECTIVE CASE SERIES OF 51 HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS (18 MALES AND 33 FEMALES) GROUP 1 AND 51 ALLERGIC RHINITIS PATIENTS (18 MALES AND 33 FEMALES) GROUP 2. THE OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE UPPER AIRWAY RESISTANCE WAS MEASURED USING A RHINOMANOMETER AND THE LOWER AIRWAY RESISTANCE WAS MEASURED USING A SPIROMETER. THEN THE SUBJECTS PRACTICED SPECIFIC HATHA YOGASANAS FOR THREE MONTHS. THEN THE AIRWAY RESISTANCE TESTS WERE AGAIN DONE AT 3 MONTHS INTERVAL. THE SUBJECTIVE ANALYSIS WAS DONE PRE YOGA AND POST YOGA USING THE SHORT FORM-12 (SF-12) AND SINO NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT) QUESTIONNAIRES TO ASSESS THE QUALITY OF LIFE. THE DATA WAS ANALYZED BY DOING A PAIRED (2-TAILED) T TEST, USING SPSS (SOFTWARE PACKAGE FOR SOCIAL SCIENCES) VERSION 16. TOTAL NASAL AIRWAY RESISTANCE PRE YOGA AND POST YOGA IN 51 HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED AT 150 PA AND THE FORCED VITAL CAPACITY(FVC) PRE YOGA AND POST YOGA HAD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED,FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME (FEV1) & % RESIDUAL STANDARD DEVIATION (%RSD) HAD INCREASED BUT NOT SIGNIFICANT. THE PHYSICAL COMPONENT SCORE (PCS) AND MENTAL COMPONENT SCORE (MCS) OF THE SF-12 HEALTH SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRE HAD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED WITH AND THE SNOT QUESTIONNAIRE SCORE HAD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED. THE TOTAL NASAL AIRWAY RESISTANCE IN 51 ALLERGIC RHINITIS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED AT 150 PA AND THE FVC PRE YOGA AND POST YOGA SHOWED INCREASE BUT CHANGE WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT, FEV1 PRE YOGA AND POST YOGA HAD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED, %RSD PRE YOGA AND POST YOGA HAD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED. THE PCS AND MCS OF THE SF-12 HEALTH SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRE HAD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED AND THE SNOT QUESTIONNAIRE SCORE HAD SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED. THE SCIENTIFIC DOCUMENTATION OF THE IMPACT OF HATHA YOGA ON THE AIRWAY RESISTANCES CAN BE AN EYE OPENER IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SEVERAL OTHER DISEASES OF THE AIRWAYS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
5 1353  24 IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF SPECIFIC NOSTRIL MANIPULATING YOGA BREATHING PRACTICES ON AUTONOMIC AND RESPIRATORY VARIABLES. THE EFFECT OF RIGHT, LEFT, AND ALTERNATE NOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING (I.E., RNYB, LNYB, AND ANYB, RESPECTIVELY) WERE COMPARED WITH BREATH AWARENESS (BAW) AND NORMAL BREATHING (CTL). AUTONOMIC AND RESPIRATORY VARIABLES WERE STUDIED IN 21 MALE VOLUNTEERS WITH AGES BETWEEN 18 AND 45 YEARS AND EXPERIENCE IN THE YOGA BREATHING PRACTICES BETWEEN 3 AND 48 MONTHS. SUBJECTS WERE ASSESSED IN FIVE EXPERIMENTAL SESSIONS ON FIVE SEPARATE DAYS. THE SESSIONS WERE IN FIXED POSSIBLE SEQUENCES AND SUBJECTS WERE ASSIGNED TO A SEQUENCE RANDOMLY. EACH SESSION WAS FOR 40 MIN; 30 MIN FOR THE BREATHING PRACTICE, PRECEDED AND FOLLOWED BY 5 MIN OF QUIET SITTING. ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED HEART RATE VARIABILITY, SKIN CONDUCTANCE, FINGER PLETHYSMOGRAM AMPLITUDE, BREATH RATE, AND BLOOD PRESSURE. FOLLOWING RNYB THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SYSTOLIC, DIASTOLIC AND MEAN PRESSURE. IN CONTRAST, THE SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC PRESSURE DECREASED AFTER ANYB AND THE SYSTOLIC AND MEAN PRESSURE WERE LOWER AFTER LNYB. HENCE, UNILATERAL NOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING PRACTICES APPEAR TO INFLUENCE THE BLOOD PRESSURE IN DIFFERENT WAYS. THESE EFFECTS SUGGEST POSSIBLE THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
6  985  38 EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA AND OMKAR MEDITATION ON CARDIORESPIRATORY PERFORMANCE, PSYCHOLOGIC PROFILE, AND MELATONIN SECRETION. OBJECTIVES: TO EVALUATE EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA AND OMKAR MEDITATION ON CARDIORESPIRATORY PERFORMANCE, PSYCHOLOGIC PROFILE, AND MELATONIN SECRETION. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: THIRTY HEALTHY MEN IN THE AGE GROUP OF 25-35 YEARS VOLUNTEERED FOR THE STUDY. THEY WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED IN TWO GROUPS OF 15 EACH. GROUP 1 SUBJECTS SERVED AS CONTROLS AND PERFORMED BODY FLEXIBILITY EXERCISES FOR 40 MINUTES AND SLOW RUNNING FOR 20 MINUTES DURING MORNING HOURS AND PLAYED GAMES FOR 60 MINUTES DURING EVENING HOURS DAILY FOR 3 MONTHS. GROUP 2 SUBJECTS PRACTICED SELECTED YOGIC ASANAS (POSTURES) FOR 45 MINUTES AND PRANAYAMA FOR 15 MINUTES DURING THE MORNING, WHEREAS DURING THE EVENING HOURS THESE SUBJECTS PERFORMED PREPARATORY YOGIC POSTURES FOR 15 MINUTES, PRANAYAMA FOR 15 MINUTES, AND MEDITATION FOR 30 MINUTES DAILY, FOR 3 MONTHS. ORTHOSTATIC TOLERANCE, HEART RATE, BLOOD PRESSURE, RESPIRATORY RATE, DYNAMIC LUNG FUNCTION (SUCH AS FORCED VITAL CAPACITY, FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1 SECOND, FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME PERCENTAGE, PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE, AND MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION), AND PSYCHOLOGIC PROFILE WERE MEASURED BEFORE AND AFTER 3 MONTHS OF YOGIC PRACTICES. SERIAL BLOOD SAMPLES WERE DRAWN AT VARIOUS TIME INTERVALS TO STUDY EFFECTS OF THESE YOGIC PRACTICES AND OMKAR MEDITATION ON MELATONIN LEVELS. RESULTS: YOGIC PRACTICES FOR 3 MONTHS RESULTED IN AN IMPROVEMENT IN CARDIORESPIRATORY PERFORMANCE AND PSYCHOLOGIC PROFILE. THE PLASMA MELATONIN ALSO SHOWED AN INCREASE AFTER THREE MONTHS OF YOGIC PRACTICES. THE SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE, DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE, MEAN ARTERIAL PRESSURE, AND ORTHOSTATIC TOLERANCE DID NOT SHOW ANY SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION WITH PLASMA MELATONIN. HOWEVER, THE MAXIMUM NIGHT TIME MELATONIN LEVELS IN YOGA GROUP SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION (R = 0.71, P < 0.05) WITH WELL-BEING SCORE. CONCLUSION: THESE OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT YOGIC PRACTICES CAN BE USED AS PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGIC STIMULI TO INCREASE ENDOGENOUS SECRETION OF MELATONIN, WHICH, IN TURN, MIGHT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPROVED SENSE OF WELL-BEING.	2004	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
7  214  33 A STUDY OF THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA. THE ROLE OF YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES, AS AN ADJUNCT TREATMENT FOR BRONCHIAL ASTHMA IS WELL RECOGNIZED. ONE HUNDRED TWENTY PATIENTS OF ASTHMA WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS I.E GROUP A (YOGA TRAINING GROUP) AND GROUP B (CONTROL GROUP). EACH GROUP INCLUDED SIXTY PATIENTS. PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS WERE PERFORMED ON ALL THE PATIENTS AT BASELINE, AFTER 4 WEEKS AND THEN AFTER 8 WEEKS. MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS IN THE TWO GROUPS HAD MILD DISEASE (34 PATIENTS IN GROUP A AND 32 IN GROUP B). GROUP A SUBJECTS SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASING TREND (P < 0.01) IN % PREDICTED PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN THE FIRST SECOND (FEV1), FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), FORCED MID EXPIRATORY FLOW IN 0.25-0.75 SECONDS (FEF25-75) AND FEV1/FVC% RATIO AT 4 WEEKS AND 8 WEEKS AS COMPARED TO GROUP B.

8  865  33 EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICES ON PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS INCLUDING TRANSFER FACTOR OF LUNG FOR CARBON MONOXIDE (TLCO) IN ASTHMA PATIENTS. PRANA IS THE ENERGY, WHEN THE SELF-ENERGIZING FORCE EMBRACES THE BODY WITH EXTENSION AND EXPANSION AND CONTROL, IT IS PRANAYAMA. IT MAY AFFECT THE MILIEU AT THE BRONCHIOLES AND THE ALVEOLI PARTICULARLY AT THE ALVEOLO-CAPILLARY MEMBRANE TO FACILITATE DIFFUSION AND TRANSPORT OF GASES. IT MAY ALSO INCREASE OXYGENATION AT TISSUE LEVEL. AIM OF OUR STUDY IS TO COMPARE PULMONARY FUNCTIONS AND DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN PATIENTS OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA BEFORE AND AFTER YOGIC INTERVENTION OF 2 MONTHS. SIXTY STABLE ASTHMATIC-PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS I.E GROUP 1 (YOGA TRAINING GROUP) AND GROUP 2 (CONTROL GROUP). EACH GROUP INCLUDED THIRTY PATIENTS. LUNG FUNCTIONS WERE RECORDED ON ALL PATIENTS AT BASELINE, AND THEN AFTER TWO MONTHS. GROUP 1 SUBJECTS SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT (P<0.001) IN TRANSFER FACTOR OF THE LUNG FOR CARBON MONOXIDE (TLCO), FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1ST SEC (FEV1), PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR), MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION (MVV) AND SLOW VITAL CAPACITY (SVC) AFTER YOGA PRACTICE. QUALITY OF LIFE ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT PRANAYAMA & YOGA BREATHING AND STRETCHING POSTURES ARE USED TO INCREASE RESPIRATORY STAMINA, RELAX THE CHEST MUSCLES, EXPAND THE LUNGS, RAISE ENERGY LEVELS, AND CALM THE BODY.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
9  880  33 EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON HANDGRIP, RESPIRATORY PRESSURES AND PULMONARY FUNCTION. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REPORTS ON THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS, VERY FEW STUDIES HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN ON THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON RESPIRATORY PRESSURES AND HANDGRIP ENDURANCE. HENCE THE PRESENT WORK WAS PLANNED TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON HAND GRIP STRENGTH (HGS), HAND GRIP ENDURANCE (HGE), MAXIMUM EXPIRATORY PRESSURE (MEP), MAXIMUM INSPIRATORY PRESSURE (MIP), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME (FEV), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN FIRST SECOND (FEV1) AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR). 20 SCHOOL CHILDREN IN THE AGE GROUP OF 12 TO 15 YEARS WERE GIVEN YOGA TRAINING (ASANS AND PRANAYAMS) FOR 6 MONTHS. 20 AGE AND GENDER-MATCHED STUDENTS FORMED THE CONTROL GROUP. YOGA TRAINING PRODUCED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.05) INCREASE IN HGS AND HGE. MEP, MIP, FEV, FEV1 AND PEFR ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (P < 0.001) AFTER THE YOGA TRAINING. IN CONTRAST, THE INCREASE IN THESE PARAMETERS IN THE CONTROL GROUP WAS STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT. OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT YOGA TRAINING FOR 6 MONTHS IMPROVES LUNG FUNCTION, STRENGTH OF INSPIRATORY AND EXPIRATORY MUSCLES AS WELL AS SKELETAL MUSCLE STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT YOGA BE INTRODUCED AT SCHOOL LEVEL IN ORDER TO IMPROVE PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS, OVERALL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE OF STUDENTS.	2003	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
10  332  29 APPLICATION OF STANDARDISED YOGA PROTOCOLS AS THE BASIS OF PHYSIOTHERAPY RECOMMENDATION IN TREATMENT OF SLEEP APNEAS: MOVING BEYOND PRANAYAMAS. YOGA IS AN ANCIENT INDIAN PRACTICE OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL EXERCISES (SYN: ASANAS), POSTURES (SYN: MUDRAS), MOVEMENTS AND BREATHING TECHNIQUES WHICH SUSTAIN HEALTHY LIVING OF THE BODY AND THE MIND. IT INCORPORATES VARIOUS EXERCISES OF BREATHING, OROPHARYNGEAL STRUCTURES AND FACIAL EXPRESSIONS, THE PHYSIOLOGY AND EFFECT OF WHICH ARE COMPARABLE TO INTERNATIONAL PHYSIOTHERAPY RECOMMENDATIONS IN TREATMENT OF OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA (OSA) I.E. TO PRESERVE UPPER AIRWAY PATENCY BY MAINTAINING AIRWAY DILATOR MUSCLE TONE. PRELIMINARY RESULTS SHOW THAT YOGA CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO PHYSIOTHERAPY FOR SLEEP APNEA AND SNORING PATIENTS. TO COMPARE THE PHYSIOTHERAPY RECOMMENDATIONS IN SNORING PATIENTS WITH VARIOUS YOGA EXERCISES POSTURES. TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN TREATMENT OF SLEEP APNEA. TO FORMULATE A STANDARDIZED YOGA PROTOCOL FOR UNIVERSAL USAGE IN SLEEP APNEA. WE STUDIED THE AVAILABLE LITERATURE ON PHYSIOTHERAPY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OSA AND YOGA ASANAS INVOLVING THE NASAL, OROPHARYNX AND FACIAL STRUCTURES AND PERCEIVED A NOTEWORTHY SIMILARITY IN PHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS OF BOTH. A SET OF THESE YOGASANAS WERE PUT TOGETHER AND PATIENTS PRESENTING WITH SNORING AND DIAGNOSED WITH MILD TO MODERATE SLEEP APNEA WERE PRESENTED AND ENCOURAGED TO PERFORM THE STANDARDIZED SET OF YOGA EXERCISES FOR A PERIOD OF 3 MONTHS. A TOTAL OF 23 PATIENTS WERE RECOMMENDED YOGA PROTOCOLS AS INITIAL FORM OF TREATMENT IN SNORING AND MILD TO MODERATE SLEEP APNEA. CLINICAL AND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT GAUZED BY RECOMMENDED SCORE CHART WAS DISCERNED IN MAJORITY OF SUBJECTS. THE RESULTS WERE COMPARABLE TO THE EFFICACY OF EXISTING PHYSIOTHERAPY REGIMEN PUBLISHED IN INTERNATIONAL LITERATURE. THE BENEFITS OF YOGA IN SLEEP DISORDERS GO BEYOND THE SCOPE OF MEASURED OUTCOMES. STANDARDIZING THE PROTOCOLS FOR YOGA IN TREATMENT FOR SNORING AND SLEEP APNEA IS THE NEED OF THE HOUR. FURTHER STUDIES ON EFFICACY OF YOGA NEED TO BE PERFORMED TO UNDERSTAND ITS FULL REALM OF POTENTIAL.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
11  867  40 EFFECT OF YOGA REGIMEN ON LUNG FUNCTIONS INCLUDING DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE PATIENTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. BACKGROUND: LUNG FUNCTIONS ARE FOUND TO BE IMPAIRED IN CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD), CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE, LEFT VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION, AND AFTER CARDIAC SURGERY. DIFFUSION CAPACITY PROGRESSIVELY WORSENS AS THE SEVERITY OF CAD INCREASES DUE TO REDUCTION IN LUNG TISSUE PARTICIPATING IN GAS EXCHANGE. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISES AND YOGIC POSTURES MAY PLAY AN IMPRESSIVE ROLE IN IMPROVING CARDIO-RESPIRATORY EFFICIENCY AND FACILITATING GAS DIFFUSION AT THE ALVEOLO-CAPILLARY MEMBRANE. THIS STUDY WAS DONE TO SEE THE EFFECT OF YOGA REGIMEN ON LUNG FUNCTIONS PARTICULARLY DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN CAD PATIENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 80 STABLE CAD PATIENTS BELOW 65 YEARS OF AGE OF BOTH SEXES WERE SELECTED AND RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS OF 40 EACH. GROUP I CAD PATIENTS WERE GIVEN YOGA REGIMEN FOR 3 MONTHS WHICH CONSISTED OF YOGIC POSTURES, PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISES, DIETARY MODIFICATION, AND HOLISTIC TEACHING ALONG WITH THEIR CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE WHILE GROUP II CAD PATIENTS WERE PUT ONLY ON CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE. LUNG FUNCTIONS INCLUDING DIFFUSION CAPACITY WERE RECORDED THRICE IN BOTH THE GROUPS: 0 DAY AS BASELINE, 22(ND) DAY AND ON 90(TH) DAY BY USING COMPUTERIZED MS MEDISOFT CARDIO-RESPIRATORY INSTRUMENT, HYP'AIR COMPACT MODEL OF CARDIO-RESPIRATORY TESTING MACHINE WAS MANUFACTURED BY P K MORGAN, INDIA. THE RECORDED PARAMETERS WERE STATISTICALLY ANALYZED BY REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA FOLLOWED BY TUKEY'S TEST IN BOTH THE GROUPS. CARDIOVASCULAR PARAMETERS WERE ALSO COMPARED BEFORE AND AFTER INTERVENTION IN BOTH THE GROUPS. RESULTS: STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE SEEN IN SLOW VITAL CAPACITY, FORCED VITAL CAPACITY, PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE, MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION, AND DIFFUSION FACTOR/ TRANSFER FACTOR OF LUNG FOR CARBON MONOXIDE AFTER 3 MONTHS OF YOGA REGIMEN IN GROUP I. FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1(ST) SEC (FEV1), AND FEV1 % ALSO SHOWED A TREND TOWARD IMPROVEMENT ALTHOUGH NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. HR, SBP AND DBP ALSO SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN GROUP-I PATIENTS WHO FOLLOWED YOGA REGIMEN. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA REGIMEN WAS FOUND TO IMPROVE LUNG FUNCTIONS AND DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN CAD PATIENTS BESIDES IMPROVING CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTIONS. THUS, IT CAN BE USED AS A COMPLIMENTARY OR ADJUNCT THERAPY ALONG WITH THE CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE FOR THEIR TREATMENT AND REHABILITATION.	2015	
                                                                                                                                
12 2510  26 YOGA BREATHING THROUGH A PARTICULAR NOSTRIL INCREASES SPATIAL MEMORY SCORES WITHOUT LATERALIZED EFFECTS. UNINOSTRIL BREATHING FACILITATES THE PERFORMANCE ON SPATIAL AND VERBAL COGNITIVE TASKS, SAID TO BE RIGHT AND LEFT BRAIN FUNCTIONS, RESPECTIVELY. SINCE HEMISPHERIC MEMORY FUNCTIONS ARE ALSO KNOWN TO BE LATERALIZED, THE PRESENT STUDY ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF UNINOSTRIL BREATHING ON THE PERFORMANCE IN VERBAL AND SPATIAL MEMORY TESTS. SCHOOL CHILDREN (N = 108 WHOSE AGES RANGED FROM 10 TO 17 YEARS) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO FOUR GROUPS. EACH GROUP PRACTICED A SPECIFIC YOGA BREATHING TECHNIQUE: (I) RIGHT NOSTRIL BREATHING, (II) LEFT NOSTRIL BREATHING, (III) ALTERNATE NOSTRIL BREATHING, OR (IV) BREATH AWARENESS WITHOUT MANIPULATION OF NOSTRILS. THESE TECHNIQUES WERE PRACTICED FOR 10 DAYS. VERBAL AND SPATIAL MEMORY WAS ASSESSED INITIALLY AND AFTER 10 DAYS. AN AGE-MATCHED CONTROL GROUP OF 27 WERE SIMILARLY ASSESSED. ALL 4 TRAINED GROUPS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SPATIAL TEST SCORES AT RETEST, BUT THE CONTROL GROUP SHOWED NO CHANGE. AVERAGE INCREASE IN SPATIAL MEMORY SCORES FOR THE TRAINED GROUPS WAS 84%. IT APPEARS YOGA BREATHING INCREASES SPATIAL RATHER THAN VERBAL SCORES, WITHOUT A LATERALIZED EFFECT.	1997	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
13 1321  25 HEMISPHERE SPECIFIC EEG RELATED TO ALTERNATE NOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING. BACKGROUND: PREVIOUSLY, FORCED UNILATERAL NOSTRIL BREATHING WAS ASSOCIATED WITH IPSILATERAL, OR CONTRALATERAL CEREBRAL HEMISPHERE CHANGES, OR NO CHANGE. HENCE IT WAS INCONCLUSIVE. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON 13 NORMAL HEALTHY PARTICIPANTS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF ALTERNATE NOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING ON (A) CEREBRAL HEMISPHERE ASYMMETRY, AND (B) CHANGES IN THE STANDARD EEG BANDS. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO THREE SESSIONS (A) ALTERNATE NOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING (ANYB), (B) BREATH AWARENESS AND (C) QUIET SITTING, ON SEPARATE DAYS. EEG WAS RECORDED FROM BILATERALLY SYMMETRICAL SITES (FP1, FP2, C3, C4, O1 AND O2). ALL SITES WERE REFERENCED TO THE IPSILATERAL EAR LOBE. RESULTS: THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN CEREBRAL HEMISPHERE SYMMETRY. THE RELATIVE POWER IN THE THETA BAND WAS DECREASED DURING ALTERNATE NOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING (ANYB) AND THE BETA AMPLITUDE WAS LOWER AFTER ANYB. DURING QUIET SITTING THE RELATIVE POWER IN THE BETA BAND INCREASED, WHILE THE AMPLITUDE OF THE ALPHA BAND REDUCED. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ANYB WAS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER CALMNESS, WHEREAS QUIET SITTING WITHOUT SPECIFIC DIRECTIONS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH AROUSAL. THE RESULTS IMPLY A POSSIBLE USE OF ANYB FOR STRESS AND ANXIETY REDUCTION.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
14  777  40 EFFECT OF YOGA AND PHYSIOTHERAPY ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN CHILDREN WITH DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY - A COMPARATIVE STUDY. CONTEXT: ABNORMAL RESPIRATORY FUNCTION IS KNOWN TO BE DETECTABLE ALMOST AS SOON AS IT CAN BE MEASURED RELIABLY. STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED THE EFFECT OF RESPIRATORY MUSCLE TRAINING AS WELL AS BREATHING EXERCISES IN IMPROVING PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN CHILDREN WITH DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY (DMD). AIMS: THIS STUDY AIMS TO IDENTIFY THE ADD-ON EFFECT OF YOGA OVER PHYSIOTHERAPY ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN CHILDREN WITH DMD. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FOUR PATIENTS WITH DMD WERE RANDOMIZED TO TWO GROUPS. GROUP I RECEIVED HOME-BASED PHYSIOTHERAPY AND GROUP II RECEIVED PHYSIOTHERAPY ALONG WITH YOGA INTERVENTION. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PULMONARY FUNCTION TEST (PFT) WAS ASSESSED BEFORE THE INTERVENTION (BASELINE DATA) AND AT REGULAR INTERVALS OF 3 MONTHS FOR A PERIOD OF 1 YEAR. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: NORMALITY WAS ASSESSED USING SHAPIRO-WILK NORMALITY TEST. THE BASELINE DATA WERE ANALYZED USING MANN-WHITNEY U-TEST TO IDENTIFY THE HOMOGENEITY. REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE WAS USED TO ASSESS SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN STUDY PARAMETERS DURING THE ASSESSMENT OF EVERY 3 MONTHS, BOTH WITHIN AND BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS OF PATIENTS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 88 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED ALL THE 5 ASSESSMENTS, WITH A MEAN AGE OF 7.9 +/- 1.5 YEARS. PFT PARAMETERS SUCH AS FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE, MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION (MVV), AND TIDAL VOLUME DURING MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION (MVT) DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN GROUP I. IN GROUP II, FVC AND MVT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED FROM BASELINE UP TO 1 YEAR, WHEREAS MVV IMPROVED FROM BASELINE UP TO 9 MONTHS. TIDAL VOLUME DID NOT SHOW ANY CHANGES IN BOTH THE GROUPS. CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT INTRODUCTION OF YOGA WITH PHYSIOTHERAPY INTERVENTION AT AN EARLY AGE CAN BE CONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES IN IMPROVING PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH DMD.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
15  411  31 BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY DURING YOGA-BASED ALTERNATE NOSTRIL BREATHING PRACTICE AND BREATH AWARENESS. BACKGROUND: PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS SHOWN A REDUCTION IN BLOOD PRESSURE (BP) IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE PRACTICE OF ALTERNATE NOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING (ANYB) IN NORMAL HEALTHY MALE VOLUNTEERS AND IN HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS OF BOTH SEXES. THE BP DURING ANYB HAS NOT BEEN RECORDED. MATERIAL/METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE 26 MALE VOLUNTEERS (GROUP MEAN AGE +/-SD, 23.8+/-3.5 YEARS). WE ASSESSED (1) HEART RATE VARIABILITY, (2) NON-INVASIVE ARTERIAL BP, AND (3) RESPIRATION RATE, DURING (A) ANYB AND (B) BREATH AWARENESS (BAW) SESSIONS. EACH SESSION WAS 25 MINUTES. WE PERFORMED ASSESSMENTS AT 3 TIME POINTS: PRE (5 MINUTES), DURING (15 MINUTES; FOR ANYB OR BAW) AND POST (5 MINUTES). A NAIVE-TO-YOGA CONTROL GROUP (N=15 MALES, MEAN AGE +/-SD 26.1+/-4.0 YEARS) WERE ASSESSED WHILE SEATED QUIETLY FOR 25 MINUTES. RESULTS: DURING ANYB THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE (REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA) IN SYSTOLIC BP AND RESPIRATION RATE; WHILE RMSSD (THE SQUARE ROOT OF THE MEAN OF THE SUM OF SQUARES OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ADJACENT NN INTERVALS) AND NN50 (THE NUMBER OF INTERVAL DIFFERENCES OF SUCCESSIVE NORMAL TO NORMAL INTERVALS GREATER THAN 50 MS) SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED. DURING BAW RESPIRATION RATE DECREASED. IN CONTRAST, RESPIRATION RATE INCREASED DURING THE CONTROL STATE. ANYB AND BAW WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT (2-FACTOR ANOVA) IN RMSSD AND RESPIRATION RATE. BAW AND CONTROL WERE DIFFERENT WITH RESPECT TO RESPIRATION RATE. CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT VAGAL ACTIVITY INCREASED DURING AND AFTER ANYB, WHICH COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECREASE IN BP AND CHANGES IN THE HRV.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
16  442  31 CEREBROVASCULAR DYNAMICS ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA BREATHING AND BREATH AWARENESS. AIMS: BREATH FREQUENCY CAN ALTER CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW. THE STUDY AIMED TO DETERMINE BILATERAL MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERIAL HEMODYNAMICS IN HIGH-FREQUENCY YOGA BREATHING (HFYB) AND SLOW FREQUENCY ALTERNATE NOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING (ANYB) USING TRANSCRANIAL DOPPLER SONOGRAPHY. METHODS: HEALTHY MALE VOLUNTEERS WERE ASSESSED IN TWO SEPARATE TRIALS BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER HFYB (2.0 HZ FOR 1 MIN, N = 16) AND ANYB (12 BREATHS PER MINUTE FOR 5 MIN, N = 22). HFYB AND ANYB WERE SEPARATELY COMPARED TO BREATH AWARENESS (BAW) AND TO CONTROL SESSIONS. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: THE DATA WERE ANALYZED USING REPEATED-MEASURES ANOVA WITH BONFERRONI ADJUSTED POST HOC TESTS. RESULTS: DURING HFYB THERE WAS A DECREASE IN END-DIASTOLIC VELOCITY (EDV) AND MEAN FLOW VELOCITY (MFV) (P < 0.01 FOR LEFT AND P < 0.05 FOR RIGHT MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERIES; MCA) WITH AN INCREASE IN PULSATILITY INDEX (PI) FOR THE RIGHT MCA (P < 0.05). DURING ANYB, THERE WAS A BILATERAL DECREASE IN PEAK SYSTOLIC VELOCITY (P < 0.05 FOR LEFT AND P < 0.01 FOR RIGHT MCA), EDV (P < 0.01) AND MFV (P < 0.01 FOR LEFT AND P < 0.001 FOR RIGHT MCA) AND AN INCREASE IN PI (P < 0.01). DURING BAW OF THE TWO SESSIONS THERE WAS A DECREASE IN LATERALIZED FLOW AND END-DIASTOLIC VELOCITIES (P < 0.05) AND AN INCREASE IN PI (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: CHANGES IN PEAK FLOW VELOCITIES AND PULSATILITY INDICES DURING AND AFTER HFYB, ANYB, AND BAW SUGGEST DECREASED CEREBROVASCULAR BLOOD FLOW AND INCREASED FLOW RESISTANCE BASED ON DIFFERENT MECHANISMS.	2022

19  453  32 CHANGES IN MIDAS, PERCEIVED STRESS, FRONTALIS MUSCLE ACTIVITY AND NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS USAGE IN PATIENTS WITH MIGRAINE HEADACHE WITHOUT AURA FOLLOWING AYURVEDA AND YOGA COMPARED TO CONTROLS: AN OPEN LABELED NON-RANDOMIZED STUDY. BACKGROUND: THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE USE OF COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE TO PROVIDE LONG-TERM HEALING SOLUTIONS IN MIGRAINE HEADACHE PATIENTS. KNOWING THE LIMITATIONS OF CONVENTIONAL MEDICAL APPROACH, THE PRESENT STUDY EVALUATED THE INFLUENCE OF TWO INDIAN TRADITIONAL SYSTEMS OF MEDICINE ON MIGRAINE-RELATED DISABILITY, AUTONOMIC VARIABLES, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND MUSCLE ACTIVITY IN PATIENTS WITH MIGRAINE HEADACHE WITHOUT AURA. METHODS: THIRTY SUBJECTS RECRUITED TO THE AYURVEDA AND YOGA (AY) GROUP UNDERWENT TRADITIONAL PANCHAKARMA (BIO-PURIFICATION) USING THERAPEUTIC PURGATION FOLLOWED BY YOGA THERAPY, WHILE 30 SUBJECTS OF CONTROL (CT) GROUP CONTINUED ON SYMPTOMATIC TREATMENT (NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS [NSAID'S]) FOR 90 DAYS. MIGRAINE DISABILITY ASSESSMENT SCORE, PERCEIVED STRESS, HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV), AND SURFACE ELECTROMYOGRAPHY (EMG) OF FRONTALIS MUSCLE WERE MEASURED ON DAY 1, DAY 30, AND DAY 90 IN BOTH GROUPS. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN MIGRAINE DISABILITY AND PERCEIVED STRESS SCORES WERE OBSERVED IN THE AY GROUP. THE LOW-FREQUENCY COMPONENT OF THE HRV DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY, THE HIGH-FREQUENCY COMPONENT INCREASED AND THEIR RATIO SHOWED IMPROVED SYMPATHOVAGAL BALANCE. THE EMG SHOWED DECREASED ACTIVITY OF THE FRONTALIS MUSCLE IN THE AY GROUP COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: THE INTEGRATIVE APPROACH COMBINING AYURVEDA AND YOGA THERAPY REDUCES MIGRAINE-RELATED DISABILITY, PERCEIVED STRESS, SYMPATHETIC AROUSAL, AND MUSCLE TENSION.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
20  844  28 EFFECT OF YOGA ON PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS OF HYPOTHYROID PATIENTS. AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO SEE ANY EFFECT ON RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS IN HYPOTHYROID PATIENTS AFTER PRANAYAMA (YOGA). THE SUBJECTS FOR THE STUDY WERE 20 HYPOTHYROID FEMALES, 39.70 +/- 8.27 YEARS OF MEAN AGE REFERRED FROM MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF UCMS & G.T.B. HOSPITAL. SPIRO METRIC RECORDINGS WERE TAKEN WITH HYPAIR (VERSION-1.28). BASELINE (FIRST) RECORDINGS WERE TAKEN WHEN PATIENT CAME FOR THE FIRST TIME. PATIENTS CAME TO YOGA LAB IN PHYSIOLOGY DEPARTMENT FOR 21 DAYS CONTINUOUSLY WHERE THEY WERE TRAINED BY THE YOGA INSTRUCTORS AND THEN TOLD TO DO PRANAYAMA AT HOME AND CALLED AT REGULAR INTERVALS AFTER 7 DAYS TO SEE THE COMPLIANCE. THE BREATHING EXERCISES WERE DONE FOR 45 MINUTES EVERYDAY. AFTER 6 MONTHS OF PRANAYAMA SECOND RECORDING WAS TAKEN AND COMPARED WITH THE BASELINE. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN FIRST SECOND (FEV1), MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION (MVV) AND INSPIRATORY CAPACITY(IC). THUS PRANAYAMA AND MEDITATION HAS BENEFICIAL EFFECT ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS OF HYPOTHYROID PATIENTS ALONG WITH CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT.	2010

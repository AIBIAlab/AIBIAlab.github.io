1 1531 122 IYENGAR YOGA THERAPY AS AN INTERVENTION FOR CRAMP MANAGEMENT IN INDIVIDUALS WITH AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS: THREE CASE REPORTS. OBJECTIVES: PATIENTS WITH AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS (ALS), A NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE OF MOTOR NEURONS, EXPERIENCE CRAMPS AT ALL STAGES OF THE ILLNESS. THERE IS, AT PRESENT, NO EFFECTIVE MEDICATION TO CONTROL THE CRAMPS AND NO AGREEMENT ON HOW TO TREAT THE SYMPTOM IN ALS PATIENTS. SUBJECTS: THREE INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE DIAGNOSED WITH ALS AND REPORTED SUFFERING CRAMPS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE BODY, WHICH LIMITED THEIR ACTIVITIES OR AFFECTED THEIR SLEEP WERE INVITED TO TRY IYENGAR YOGA. INTERVENTION AND OUTCOME: YOGA THERAPY, COMPOSED OF STRETCHING, BREATHING, AND RELAXATION EXERCISES, WAS PRESCRIBED FOR EACH CASE, BASED ON THE SUBJECT'S PHYSICAL DISABILITY AND THE PRESENCE OF OTHER SYMPTOMS. ALTHOUGH TWO SUBJECTS EXPERIENCED CRAMPS DURING THE FIRST THERAPY SESSION, ALL THREE SUBJECTS REPORTED THE COMPLETE CESSATION OF CRAMPING WITHIN 3 WEEKS TO 8 WEEKS OF THERAPY. ONE OF THE SUBJECTS DEVELOPED CRAMPS IN THE HAND AFTER DISCONTINUING YOGA THERAPY FOR 7 MONTHS. HOWEVER, THE SYMPTOM STOPPED WITHIN 2 WEEKS OF RESUMING YOGA THERAPY. CONCLUSION: THE ALLEVIATION OF CRAMPS IN THESE THREE SUBJECTS INDICATES THE POSSIBILITY OF YOGIC INTERVENTION FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF CRAMPS IN INDIVIDUALS WITH ALS, BUT FURTHER RESEARCH IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA THERAPY AND TO DETERMINE THE EXERCISES THAT ARE MORE PRONE TO LEAD TO CRAMPING IN SOME ALS INDIVIDUALS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
2  963  25 EFFECTS OF A YOGA PROGRAM ON MENSTRUAL CRAMPS AND MENSTRUAL DISTRESS IN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WITH PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA: A SINGLE-BLIND, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA PROGRAM ON MENSTRUAL CRAMPS AND MENSTRUAL DISTRESS IN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WITH PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA. DESIGN: SINGLE-BLIND, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. PARTICIPANTS: 40 RANDOMLY SELECTED UNDERGRADUATE NURSING STUDENTS, WITH 20 EACH ASSIGNED TO AN EXERCISE OR A CONTROL GROUP. INTERVENTION: THE PARTICIPANTS ENGAGED IN A YOGA PROGRAM FOR 60 MINUTES ONCE A WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS. THE PROGRAM CONSISTED OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE COMBINED WITH RELAXATION AND MEDITATION. OUTCOME MEASURES: MENSTRUAL CRAMPS AND MENSTRUAL DISTRESS LEVELS WERE MEASURED BY USING THE VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE FOR PAIN AND THE MENSTRUAL DISTRESS QUESTIONNAIRE, RESPECTIVELY. DATA WERE ANALYZED BY USING THE KOLMOGOROV-SMIRNOV AND SHAPIRO-WILK NORMALITY TESTS, T-TEST, CHI-SQUARE TEST, LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS, AND MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (SPSS PROGRAM). RESULTS: MENSTRUAL PAIN INTENSITY (GROUP DIFFERENCE, -0.94; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI], -1.47 TO -0.42; P = 0.001) AND MENSTRUAL DISTRESS (GROUP DIFFERENCE, -1.13; 95% CI, -1.43 TO -0.82; P < 0.0001) SCORES DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT YOGA INTERVENTIONS MAY REDUCE MENSTRUAL CRAMPS AND MENSTRUAL DISTRESS IN FEMALE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WITH PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
3  789  28 EFFECT OF YOGA EXERCISE ON PREMENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS AMONG FEMALE EMPLOYEES IN TAIWAN. YOGA CLASSES DESIGNED FOR WOMEN WITH PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME ARE AVAILABLE, BUT THEIR EFFICACY IS UNCLEAR. WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF 12 WEEKS' YOGA EXERCISE (YOGA INTERVENTION) ON PREMENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS IN MENSTRUATING FEMALES IN TAIWAN. SIXTY-FOUR SUBJECTS COMPLETED THE YOGA INTERVENTION, AND BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION FILLED OUT A STRUCTURED SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRE ABOUT THEIR DEMOGRAPHICS, PERSONAL LIFESTYLE, MENSTRUAL STATUS, BASELINE MENSTRUAL PAIN SCORES, PREMENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS, AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE. OF 64 SUBJECTS, 90.6% REPORTED EXPERIENCING MENSTRUAL PAIN DURING MENSTRUATION. AFTER THE YOGA INTERVENTION, SUBJECTS REPORTED DECREASED USE OF ANALGESICS DURING MENSTRUATION (P = 0.0290) AND DECREASED MODERATE OR SEVERE EFFECTS OF MENSTRUAL PAIN ON WORK (P = 0.0011). THE YOGA EXERCISE INTERVENTION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE SCALE OF PHYSICAL FUNCTION (P = 0.0340) AND BODILY PAIN (P = 0.0087) OF THE SF-36, AND SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED ABDOMINAL SWELLING (P = 0.0011), BREAST TENDERNESS (P = 0.0348), ABDOMINAL CRAMPS (P = 0.0016), AND COLD SWEATS (P = 0.0143). MENSTRUAL PAIN MITIGATION AFTER YOGA EXERCISE CORRELATED WITH IMPROVEMENT IN SIX SCALES OF THE SF-36 (PHYSICAL FUNCTION, BODILY PAIN, GENERAL HEALTH PERCEPTION, VITALITY/ENERGY, SOCIAL FUNCTION, MENTAL HEALTH). EMPLOYERS CAN EDUCATE FEMALE EMPLOYEES ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF REGULAR EXERCISE SUCH AS YOGA, WHICH MAY DECREASE PREMENSTRUAL DISTRESS AND IMPROVE FEMALE EMPLOYEE HEALTH.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
4 1206  37 EXPERIENCES OF PREGNANT WOMEN PARTICIPATING IN ANTENATAL YOGA: A QUALITATIVE STUDY. CONTEXT: PREGNANCY YOGA IS A MODIFIED VERSION OF YOGA FOR PREGNANT WOMEN, AND IT AIMS TO REDUCE PREGNANCY-RELATED SYMPTOMS, SUCH AS INSOMNIA, LOW BACK PAIN, TIREDNESS, CONSTIPATION, LEG CRAMPS, AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH. OBJECTIVE: THE STUDY AIMED TO IDENTIFY THE EXPERIENCES AND EXPECTATIONS OF PREGNANT WOMEN RELATED TO THE PRACTICE OF YOGA. METHOD: THE RESEARCH TEAM CONDUCTED A QUALITATIVE STUDY. SETTING: THE STUDY TOOK PLACE AT THE ANTENATAL CLINIC OF A PUBLIC HOSPITAL IN THE CENTRAL ANATOLIA REGION OF TURKEY. PARTICIPANTS: THE PARTICIPANTS WERE 24 PREGNANT WOMEN AT THE CLINIC. INTERVENTION: THE STUDY INCLUDED AN INTERVENTION GROUP THAT PERFORMED YOGA AND RECEIVED ROUTINE ANTENATAL CARE; HOWEVER, NO CONTROL GROUPS WERE USED. EACH YOGA INTERVENTION WAS HELD FOR APPROXIMATELY 40-45 MINUTES, WITH YOGA ASANA PERIODS LASTING 30 MINUTES. THE PREGNANT WOMEN WERE EXPECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN YOGA PRACTICE TWICE A WEEK ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR 8 WEEKS. OUTCOME MEASURES: DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS. THE INTERVIEWS WERE RECORDED AND TRANSCRIBED VERBATIM AND THEMATIC ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED. RESULTS: FOUR MAJOR THEMES EMERGED: (1) PERCEPTIONS ABOUT PREGNANCY, (2) MANAGEMENT OF PREGNANCY SYMPTOMS, (3) PRENATAL ATTACHMENT, AND (4) BIRTH PERCEPTIONS. ACCORDING TO PARTICIPANTS, THE BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE WERE MANAGEMENT OF PREGNANCY SYMPTOMS, INCREASED PRENATAL ATTACHMENT, A POSITIVE PERCEPTION OF THE BIRTH, NATURAL-BIRTH BELIEFS, AND MANAGEMENT OF FEAR AND PAIN DURING BIRTH. CONCLUSIONS: THE PARTICIPANTS REPORTED BARRIERS TO PERFORMING YOGA; HOWEVER, THEY ALSO SAID THAT THEY WOULD TRY PREGNANCY YOGA IF THEY WERE ENCOURAGED BY HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS. ALSO, THE PARTICIPANTS STATED THAT PREGNANCY YOGA PRACTICE SHOULD BE MADE A PART OF ANTENATAL EDUCATION TO FACILITATE PARTICIPATION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
5 1532  51 IYENGAR YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION FOR ISCHIAL PRESSURE ULCERS IN A PATIENT WITH AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS: A CASE STUDY. BACKGROUND: ALTHOUGH SOME RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THE FORMATION OF PRESSURE ULCERS IS RARE IN PATIENTS WITH AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS (ALS), SEVERAL PATIENTS HAVE NONETHELESS DEVELOPED THIS PROBLEM. TO DATE, HOWEVER, NO CASE REPORTS IN THE LITERATURE HAVE DESCRIBED PATIENTS WITH ALS WHO DEVELOP ISCHIAL PRESSURE ULCERS. OUTSIDE OF THE ALS LITERATURE, EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT ISCHIAL PRESSURE ULCERS FREQUENTLY DEVELOP IN WHEELCHAIR USERS AND ALSO IN PATIENTS TREATED IN VARIOUS HEALTH CARE SETTINGS. CASE DESCRIPTION: A PATIENT DIAGNOSED WITH ALS REPORTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF ISCHIAL PRESSURE ULCERS AFTER CONSISTENT IMMOBILITY FOR 1 YEAR (32 MONTHS AFTER HER ALS DIAGNOSIS). THIS PATIENT, WHO WAS SITTING ON THE WOUNDS, WAS TREATED WITH OINTMENT AND MORPHINE; THE LATTER WAS INEFFECTIVE IN CONTROLLING THE PAIN. MOVING THE PATIENT FROM SITTING TO SUPINE, LATERAL, OR SEMILATERAL POSITIONS, EITHER ON THE BED OR WHEELCHAIR, TO SEPARATE THE ULCERS FROM THE SURFACE OF THE CHAIR OR BED WAS DEEMED IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE OF EXAGGERATION OF OTHER SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND PAIN IN OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY. A NEW METHOD OF POSTURAL ALIGNMENT WAS DEVELOPED TO ALLEVIATE THE PAIN ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRESSURE ULCER. THIS METHOD, IYENGAR YOGA THERAPY, WHICH USES PROPS TO REPOSITION A PATIENT, ALLEVIATED PAIN AND HEALING OF TWO PRESSURE ULCERS OF THE PATIENT AFTER 3 WEEKS OF STARTING THIS INTERVENTION. CONCLUSION: ALTHOUGH THE ISCHIAL PRESSURE ULCERS WERE SUCCESSFULLY TREATED IN A PATIENT WITH ALS, FURTHER STUDY IS NECESSARY TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS POSTURAL ALIGNMENT INTERVENTION IN ALS AND OTHER PATIENT POPULATIONS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF ISCHIAL PRESSURE ULCERS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
6  766  30 EFFECT OF THREE YOGA POSES (COBRA, CAT AND FISH POSES) IN WOMEN WITH PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA: A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: WE HAVE EVALUATED THE CLINICAL EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA. PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA OCCURS IN 50% OF FEMALE ADOLESCENTS AND IS A COMMON PROBLEM IN WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE. WE HAVE ASSESSED WHETHER THREE YOGA POSES (COBRA, CAT, AND FISH POSES) ARE ABLE TO REDUCE SEVERITY AND DURATION OF PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA. METHODS: TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN ADOLESCENTS WITH PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA, 92 GIRL STUDENTS,18-22 YEARS OLD, WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO AN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (N = 50) AND A CONTROL GROUP (N = 42). THE VISUAL ANALOG SCALE FOR PAIN WAS USED TO ASSESS INTENSITY OF PAIN AND THE PAIN DURATION WAS CALCULATED IN TERMS OF HOURS. EACH GROUP WAS EVALUATED FOR THREE MENSTRUAL CYCLES. AT FIRST CYCLE NO METHOD WAS PRESENTED; THE PARTICIPANTS ONLY WERE ASKED TO COMPLETE THE QUESTIONNAIRE OF MENSTRUAL CHARACTERISTICS DURING THEIR MENSTRUAL. THEN THE PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED BY THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP TO DO YOGA POSES AT LUTEAL PHASE, AND ALSO TO COMPLETE THE MENSTRUAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE IN DURING OF MENSTRUATION. THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT RECEIVE ANY INTERVENTION EXCEPT TO COMPLETE MENSTRUAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE IN DURING OF MENSTRUATION. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE PAIN INTENSITY AND PAIN DURATION IN THE POST-TESTS COMPARED WITH THE PRETEST IN YOGA GROUP (P < 0.05). THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE PAIN INTENSITY AND PAIN DURATION IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: YOGA REDUCED THE SEVERITY AND DURATION OF PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA POSES ARE SAFE AND SIMPLE TREATMENT FOR PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
7 2107  25 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON PAIN LEVEL IN PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA. THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON PAIN LEVELS IN FEMALE STUDENTS WITH PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA. THIS STUDY IS A RANDOMIZED EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WITH CONTROL GROUP AND PRETEST POST-TEST PRACTICE. THIS STUDY INCLUDED 60 VOLUNTEER FEMALE STUDENTS (30 EXPERIMENTAL AND 30 CONTROL GROUPS). THE PATIENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP TOOK PART IN THE YOGA PROGRAM A TOTAL OF 12 SESSIONS, ONCE PER WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS. "PERSONAL INFORMATION FORM", "VISUAL ANALOG SKALA (VAS)" AND "DYSMENORRHEA MONITORING FORM (DMF)" WERE USED IN DATA COLLECTION PROCESS. TO MEASURE DYSMENORRHEA PAIN, THE STUDENTS WERE REQUESTED TO MARK A NUMBER BETWEEN 1 AND 10 ON THE VAS SCALE ACCORDING TO THE SEVERITY OF THEIR PAIN ON THE MENSTRUATION STARTING DATE. THE YOGA APPLICATIONS WERE USED FOR THREE MENSTRUAL CYCLES. THE MEAN AGE OF THE STUDENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS 20.30 +/- 0.46, WHILE THE MEAN AGE OF THE STUDENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP WAS 20.46 +/- 0.50. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PAIN LEVELS OF THE STUDENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP IN THE FIRST, SECOND, THIRD AND FOURTH MEASUREMENTS WAS FOUND TO BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.001). IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PAIN LEVELS OF THE STUDENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP IN THE FIRST, SECOND, THIRD AND FOURTH MEASUREMENTS WAS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P > 0.05). YOGA CAN BE USED AS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION IN REDUCING MENSTRUAL PAIN IN WOMEN WITH PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA.	2021

SHORT-FORM MENSTRUAL DISTRESS QUESTIONNAIRES (MDQS) WERE ADMINISTERED TO ASSESS THE MENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS. ALL PARTICIPANTS WERE PROVIDED YOGA INTERVENTION, TWICE A WEEK AT 30 MINUTES/SESSION, CONSECUTIVELY FOR 8 WEEKS. BLOOD SAMPLES WERE DRAWN FROM EACH WOMAN ON THE THIRD DAY OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE. ASSESSMENTS OF MDQS AND BLOOD SAMPLES FOR THE DETERMINATION OF HOMOCYSTEINE AND NO CONCENTRATIONS WERE PERFORMED AT BASELINE AND WITHIN THE FIRST 3 DAYS OF THEIR NEXT MENSES AFTER COMPLETION OF YOGA INTERVENTION. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 30 WOMEN FROM THE DYSMENORRHEAL GROUP AND 30 FROM THE CONTROL GROUP COMPLETED THE STUDY. HOMOCYSTEINE LEVELS WERE HIGHER IN THOSE WITH DYSMENORRHEA WHEN COMPARED WITH HEALTHY CONTROLS BEFORE YOGA INTERVENTION (MANN-WHITNEY U TEST, P<0.05); HOWEVER, NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS AFTER 8 WEEKS OF YOGA TRAINING (P<0.05). THE CONCENTRATIONS OF HOMOCYSTEINE IN BOTH THE DYSMENORRHEAL AND CONTROL GROUPS AFTER 8 WEEKS DECREASED BY 51.37% AND 46.46%, RESPECTIVELY (P<0.001). THERE WERE NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN NO LEVELS BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS AT BASELINE AND AFTER INTERVENTION. THE TOTAL SCORES ON THE MDQS DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER YOGA INTERVENTION IN THE DYSMENORRHEAL GROUP (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: YOGA INTERVENTION WAS FOUND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCTIONS IN SEVERITY OF DYSMENORRHEA AND MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN LOWERING SERUM HOMOCYSTEINE LEVELS AFTER AN INTERVENTION PERIOD OF 8 WEEKS. THESE OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY HAVE THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS IN WOMEN BY RESTORING ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
9 2524  23 YOGA DURING PREGNANCY: EFFECTS ON MATERNAL COMFORT, LABOR PAIN AND BIRTH OUTCOMES. THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA PROGRAM DURING PREGNANCY, ON MATERNAL COMFORT, LABOR PAIN, AND BIRTH OUTCOMES. A RANDOMIZED TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED USING 74-PRIMIGRAVID THAI WOMEN WHO WERE EQUALLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS (EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL). THE YOGA PROGRAM INVOLVED SIX, 1-H SESSIONS AT PRESCRIBED WEEKS OF GESTATION. A VARIETY OF INSTRUMENTS WERE USED TO ASSESS MATERNAL COMFORT, LABOR PAIN AND BIRTH OUTCOMES. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS FOUND TO HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF MATERNAL COMFORT DURING LABOR AND 2H POST-LABOR, AND EXPERIENCED LESS SUBJECT EVALUATED LABOR PAIN THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. IN EACH GROUP, PAIN INCREASED AND MATERNAL COMFORT DECREASED AS LABOR PROGRESSED. NO DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND, BETWEEN THE GROUPS, REGARDING PETHIDINE USAGE, LABOR AUGMENTATION OR NEWBORN APGAR SCORES AT 1 AND 5 MIN. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS FOUND TO HAVE A SHORTER DURATION OF THE FIRST STAGE OF LABOR, AS WELL AS THE TOTAL TIME OF LABOR.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
10  852  19 EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE MENSTRUAL PAIN, PHYSICAL FITNESS, AND QUALITY OF LIFE OF YOUNG WOMEN WITH PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA. THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE EFFECT OF SPECIALLY DESIGNED YOGA PROGRAM ON THE MENSTRUAL PAIN, PHYSICAL FITNESS, AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) OF NON-ATHLETE WOMEN WITH PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA (PD) AGED 18-22 YEARS. THIRTY-FOUR VOLUNTEERS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED INTO CONTROL AND YOGA GROUPS. MENSTRUAL PAIN, PHYSICAL FITNESS, AND QOL WERE EVALUATED AT BASELINE AND AT THE END OF THE 12-WEEK STUDY PERIOD. THE YOGA GROUP WAS ASKED TO PRACTICE YOGA FOR 30 MIN PER DAY, TWICE A WEEK, FOR 12 WEEKS AT HOME, WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT RECEIVE ANY FORM OF EXERCISE OVER THE STUDY PERIOD. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVE IN MENSTRUAL PAIN, PHYSICAL FITNESS, AND QOL IN THE YOGA GROUP MORE THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. THEREFORE, THIS SPECIALLY DESIGNED YOGA PROGRAM MAY BE A POSSIBLE COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR PD.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
11 1022  30 EFFECTS OF YOGA AND MEDITATION ON THE BIRTH PROCESS. CONTEXT: DURING LABOR, CONSCIOUS MATERNAL EXPULSIVE EFFORTS ARE CRUCIAL, ESPECIALLY IN THE SECOND STAGE. CONTEMPORARILY, MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL'S BEDSIDE OBSERVATIONS INDICATE AN INADEQUACY IN THE MATERNAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE PROCESS OF DELIVERY THAT HAS LED TO INCREASED RATES OF CAESAREAN SECTIONS AND INTERVENTIONAL DELIVERIES. FOR THAT REASON, THE IMPORTANCE OF YOGA, MEDITATION, AND BREATH-AWARENESS PRACTICES INCREASES DURING PREGNANCY AND BIRTH. OBJECTIVE: THE STUDY INTENDED TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT ON THE DELIVERY PROCESS OF THE PRACTICE OF YOGA AND MEDITATION DURING PREGNANCY AND LABOR. DESIGN: THE RESEARCH TEAM DESIGNED A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: THE RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED BETWEEN OCTOBER 2016 AND MAY 2018 AT AN EDUCATIONAL AND RESEARCH HOSPITAL IN ISTANBUL, TURKEY, ON THE ANATOLIAN SIDE OF THE ISTANBUL PROVINCE. PARTICIPANTS: PARTICIPANTS WERE 90 PRIMIPAROUS PREGNANT WOMEN WHO APPLIED TO THE PREGNANCY SCHOOL AT THE HOSPITAL AND WHO MET THE CRITERIA FOR ACCEPTANCE INTO THE STUDY. INTERVENTION: THE PARTICIPANTS WAS RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS, 30 IN AN INTERVENTION GROUP AND 60 IN A CONTROL GROUP. THE INTERVENTION GROUP PERFORMED YOGA AND MEDITATION FOR 60 MINUTES TWO TIMES A WEEK FOR 10 WEEKS. YOGA AND MEDITATION PRACTICES ALSO OCCURRED DURING THE COURSE OF LABOR FOR THE INTERVENTION GROUP. ROUTINE MIDWIFERY CARE WAS GIVEN TO BOTH GROUPS DURING LABOR. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE DATA WERE COLLECTED USING: (1) THE STATE TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY (STAI), (2) THE WIJMA DELIVERY EXPECTANCY/EXPERIENCE QUESTIONNAIRE A, (3) THE CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY SCALE (CBSEI) SHORT FORM, (4) THE WIJMA DELIVERY EXPECTANCY/EXPERIENCE QUESTIONNAIRE VERSION B, AND (5) A VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS) FOR PAIN. RESULTS: WHEN THE LABOR DATA WERE EVALUATED, THE INTERVENTION GROUP HAD STATISTICALLY HIGHER VAGINAL DELIVERY RATES, LOWER LABOR INTERVENTION RATES AND EPISIOTOMY OPENING FREQUENCIES, LOWER PAIN MEASUREMENT SCORES AND WIJMA B SCORES, AND HIGHER CBSEI SCORES THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. HOWEVER, THE INTERVENTION GROUP'S STAI SCORES HAD INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER THE PRACTICE POST INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA AND MEDITATION ARE EFFECTIVE METHODS FOR REDUCING PAIN AND FEAR PERCEPTION AND INCREASING SELF-EFFICACY AND VAGINAL DELIVERY RATES DURING THE LABOR PROCESS.	2022	

12 2136  23 THE EFFECTS OF ACUPRESSURE AND YOGA FOR COPING WITH PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROMES ON PREMENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMS TO IDENTIFY THE EFFECTS OF ACUPRESSURE AND YOGA FOR COPING WITH PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROMES (PMS) ON THE PREMENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE. METHODS: THIS STUDY ADOPTED A RANDOMIZED INTERVENTION DESIGN WITH A PRETEST-POSTTEST CONTROL GROUP. THE SAMPLE CONSISTED OF 155 STUDENTS WITH PMS COMPLAINTS (50 IN YOGA, 51 IN ACUPRESSURE, AND 54 IN CONTROL GROUP). THE STUDENTS IN THE INTERVENTION GROUPS DID YOGA AND RECEIVED ACUPRESSURE THROUGHOUT 12 WEEKS. RESULTS: IT WAS FOUND THAT THE PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME SCALE POSTTEST MEAN SCORE OF THE STUDENTS WAS LOWER, AND THE PHYSICAL HEALTH, PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH, AND ENVIRONMENT SUB-SCALE MEAN SCORES OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE WERE HIGHER IN THE YOGA GROUP IN COMPARISON TO THE OTHER GROUPS (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: YOGA WAS FOUND TO BE A MORE EFFECTIVE NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL METHOD FOR COPING WITH PREMENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
13 2525  30 YOGA DURING PREGNANCY: THE EFFECTS ON LABOR PAIN AND DELIVERY OUTCOMES (A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL). OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF AN ANTENATAL YOGA PROGRAM ON PERCEIVED MATERNAL LABOR PAIN AND DELIVERY OUTCOMES. MATERIAL & METHODS: THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED WITH SIXTY PRIMIPAROUS WOMEN, AGED 18-35 YEARS OLD, WHO WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER AN ANTENATAL YOGA PROGRAM OR CONTROL GROUPS. LABOR PAIN AND DISCOMFORT LEVEL OF THE PARTICIPANTS WERE MEASURED USING A VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE AT CERVICAL DILATATION OF 3-4 C AND AT 2 AND 4 H AFTER THE INITIAL MEASUREMENT. DEMOGRAPHIC AND OBSTETRICAL INFORMATION WERE COLLECTED. THE ANTENATAL YOGA PROGRAM CONSISTED OF A 1-H SUPERVISED YOGA CLASS, THREE TIMES A WEEKLY, STARTING AT 26 WEEKS GESTATION. . RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS IN CONTROL GROUP REPORTED HIGHER PAIN INTENSITY COMPARED TO EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AT 3-4 CM OF DILATATION (P = 0.01) AND AT 2 H AFTER THE FIRST AND THE SECOND MEASUREMENTS (P = 0.000). MOTHERS IN THE ANTENATAL INTERVENTION GROUP THAT COMPLETED THE YOGA CLASS REQUIRED A DECREASED FREQUENCY OF LABOR INDUCTION IN COMPARISON WITH CONTROL GROUP (P = 0.008). IN ADDITION, MODE OF DELIVERY OF THE INTERVENTION GROUP RESULTED IN A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF CESAREAN SECTION THAN CONTROL GROUP (P = 0.002). LASTLY, THE INTERVENTION GROUP EXPERIENCED A SHORTER DURATION OF THE SECOND AND THIRD STAGES OF LABOR. INTERVAL LEVEL DATA WAS ANALYZED BY USING AN INDEPENDENT T-TEST AND CHI-SQUARE. CONCLUSION: YOGA DURING PREGNANCY MAY CONTRIBUTE TO A REDUCTION PAIN OF LABOR AND IMPROVED ADEQUACY OF CHILDBIRTH.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
14 2088  27 THE EFFECT OF PRACTICING YOGA DURING PREGNANCY ON LABOR STAGES LENGTH, ANXIETY AND PAIN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: ANXIETY AND FEAR OF LABOR PAIN HAS LED TO ELEVATED CESAREAN SECTION RATE IN SOME COUNTRIES. THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA IN PREGNANCY ON ANXIETY, LABOR PAIN AND LENGTH OF LABOR STAGES. METHODS: THIS CLINICAL TRIAL STUDY WAS PERFORMED ON 84 NULLIPAROUS WOMEN WHO WERE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OLD AND WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS OF YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS. PREGNANCY YOGA PROGRAM CONSISTING OF 6 60-MIN TRAINING SESSIONS WAS STARTED EVERY 2 WEEKS FROM WEEK 26 OF PREGNANCY AND CONTINUED UNTIL 37 WEEKS OF GESTATION. ANXIETY SEVERITY AT MATERNAL ADMISSION TO LABOR WAS MEASURED BY THE SPIELBERGERS STATE-TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY, AND LABOR PAIN WAS MEASURED BY VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS) AT DILATATION (4-5 CM) AND 2 H AFTER THE FIRST MEASUREMENT. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING CHI-SQUARE AND T-TEST. RESULTS: INTERVENTION GROUP REPORTED LESS PAIN AT DILATATION (4-5 CM) (P=0.001) AND 2 H AFTER THE FIRST MEASUREMENT (P=0.001) THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. STAT ANXIETY WAS ALSO LOWER IN INTERVENTION GROUP THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (P=0.003) AT THE ENTRANCE TO LABOR ROOM. SUBJECTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP REQUIRED MORE INDUCTION COMPARED TO INTERVENTION GROUP (P=0.003). WOMEN IN INTERVENTION GROUP EXPERIENCED SHORTER DURATION OF THE FIRST PHASE OF THE LABOR THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (P=0.002). ALSO, THE TOTAL DURATION OF TWO STAGES OF LABOR WAS SHORTER IN INTERVENTION GROUP THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: PRACTICING YOGA DURING PREGNANCY MAY REDUCE WOMEN'S ANXIETY DURING LABOR; SHORTEN LABOR STAGES, AND LOWER LABOR PAIN.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
15  992  26 EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA PRACTICE ON THE HEALTH-RELATED ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL FITNESS. TEN HEALTHY, UNTRAINED VOLUNTEERS (NINE FEMALES AND ONE MALE), RANGING IN AGE FROM 18-27 YEARS, WERE STUDIED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA PRACTICE ON THE HEALTH-RELATED ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL FITNESS, INCLUDING MUSCULAR STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE, FLEXIBILITY, CARDIORESPIRATORY FITNESS, BODY COMPOSITION, AND PULMONARY FUNCTION. SUBJECTS WERE REQUIRED TO ATTEND A MINIMUM OF TWO YOGA CLASSES PER WEEK FOR A TOTAL OF 8 WEEKS. EACH YOGA SESSION CONSISTED OF 10 MINUTES OF PRANAYAMAS (BREATH-CONTROL EXERCISES), 15 MINUTES OF DYNAMIC WARM-UP EXERCISES, 50 MINUTES OF ASANAS (YOGA POSTURES), AND 10 MINUTES OF SUPINE RELAXATION IN SAVASANA (CORPSE POSE). THE SUBJECTS WERE EVALUATED BEFORE AND AFTER THE 8-WEEK TRAINING PROGRAM. ISOKINETIC MUSCULAR STRENGTH FOR ELBOW EXTENSION, ELBOW FLEXION, AND KNEE EXTENSION INCREASED BY 31%, 19%, AND 28% (P<0.05), RESPECTIVELY, WHEREAS ISOMETRIC MUSCULAR ENDURANCE FOR KNEE FLEXION INCREASED 57% (P<0.01). ANKLE FLEXIBILITY, SHOULDER ELEVATION, TRUNK EXTENSION, AND TRUNK FLEXION INCREASED BY 13% (P<0.01), 155% (P<0.001), 188% (P<0.001), AND 14% (P<0.05), RESPECTIVELY. ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE MAXIMAL OXYGEN UPTAKE INCREASED BY 7% AND 6%, RESPECTIVELY (P<0.01). THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT REGULAR HATHA YOGA PRACTICE CAN ELICIT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE HEALTH-RELATED ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL FITNESS.

16 2303  33 TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA ON PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME. BACKGROUND: EIGHTY PERCENT OF WOMEN DURING THEIR REPRODUCTIVE AGE EXPERIENCE SOME SYMPTOMS ATTRIBUTED TO PREMENSTRUAL PHASE OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE. PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME (PMS) IS CHARACTERIZED BY EMOTIONAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS THAT OCCUR DURING LATE LUTEAL PHASE OF MENSTRUAL CYCLE AND ARE RELIEVED AFTER THE ONSET OF MENSTRUATION. AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA ARE ONE OF THE WAYS TO REDUCE THESE SYMPTOMS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA ON PMS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 72 PARTICIPANTS OF PMS, REFERRED FOR PHYSIOTHERAPY TREATMENT (MEAN AGE 28 YEARS), WERE ENROLLED AND ALLOCATED INTO TWO GROUPS (GROUP A AND B) BY SIMPLE COMPUTERIZED RANDOMIZATION. PATIENTS IN GROUP A RECEIVED AEROBIC EXERCISE AND IN GROUP B RECEIVED YOGA MOVEMENTS FOR 40 MIN, 3 TIMES A WEEK FOR 1 MONTH. THE PAIN INTENSITY (VISUAL ANALOG SCALE) AND PMS SCALE WERE MEASURED BEFORE, AT THE END OF 15 DAYS, AND 1 MONTH OF TREATMENT PROGRAM. RESULTS: DATA WERE ANALYZED BY PAIRED T-TEST, UNPAIRED T-TEST, AND ONE-WAY ANOVA; AND THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT BOTH AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA MOVEMENTS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED PAIN INTENSITY AND PMS SYMPTOMS. SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PMS SYMPTOMS WAS FOUND IN PATIENTS TREATED WITH YOGA COMPARED TO AEROBIC EXERCISE; HOWEVER, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND IN PAIN INTENSITY BETWEEN THESE TWO GROUPS (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: IT IS CONCLUDED THAT BOTH AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA MOVEMENTS ARE EFFECTIVE IN TREATING PMS; HOWEVER, YOGA IS MORE EFFECTIVE IN RELIEVING THE SYMPTOMS OF PMS THAN AEROBIC EXERCISE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
17  519  24 COMPARING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA & ORAL CALCIUM ADMINISTRATION IN ALLEVIATING SYMPTOMS OF PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME IN MEDICAL UNDERGRADUATES. INTRODUCTION: MEDICAL UNDERGRADUATES ARE HEAVILY BURDENED BY THEIR CURRICULUM. THE FEMALES, IN ADDITION, SUFFER FROM VIVID AFFECTIVE OR SOMATIC PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME (PMS) SYMPTOMS SUCH AS BLOATING, MASTALGIA, INSOMNIA, FATIGUE, MOOD SWINGS, IRRITABILITY, AND DEPRESSION. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS PROPOSED TO ATTENUATE THE SYMPTOMS OF PMS BY SIMPLE LIFESTYLE MEASURES LIKE YOGA AND/OR ORAL CALCIUM. METHODS: 65 MEDICAL FEMALE STUDENTS (18-22 YEARS) WITH A REGULAR MENSTRUAL CYCLE WERE ASKED TO SELF-RATE THEIR SYMPTOMS, ALONG WITH THEIR SEVERITY, IN A VALIDATED QUESTIONNAIRE FOR TWO CONSECUTIVE MENSTRUAL CYCLES. FIFTY-EIGHT STUDENTS WERE FOUND TO HAVE PMS. TWENTY GIRLS WERE GIVEN YOGA TRAINING (45 MINUTES DAILY, FIVE DAYS A WEEK, FOR THREE MONTHS). ANOTHER GROUP OF 20 WAS GIVEN ORAL TABLETS OF CALCIUM CARBONATE DAILY (500 MG, FOR THREE MONTHS) AND REST 18 GIRL SERVED AS CONTROL GROUP. DATA WERE ANALYZED BY SPSS VER.13 SOFTWARE. RESULTS: THE YOGA AND CALCIUM GROUPS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN NUMBER AND SEVERITY OF PREMENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS WHEREAS IN THE CONTROL GROUP THERE WAS NOT THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE. CONCLUSION: ENCOURAGING A REGULAR PRACTICE OF YOGA OR TAKING A TABLET OF CALCIUM DAILY IN THE MEDICAL SCHOOLS CAN DECREASE THE SYMPTOMS OF PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
18 2326  29 TREATMENT OF PREGNANCY-RELATED LUMBAR AND PELVIC GIRDLE PAIN BY THE YOGA METHOD: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. OBJECTIVE: PREGNANCY-RELATED LUMBOPELVIC PAIN IS A MAJOR PROBLEM FOR THE MAJORITY OF PREGNANT WOMEN. COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE HAS BEEN USED TO ALLEVIATE PAIN, AND YOGA IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE METHODS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HATHA YOGA IN THE REDUCTION OF LUMBOPELVIC PAIN IN PREGNANCY. METHODS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH 60 PREGNANT WOMEN (AGE RANGE, 14-40 YEARS) WHO REPORTED LUMBOPELVIC PAIN AT 12 TO 32 WEEKS OF GESTATION WAS CONDUCTED FROM JUNE 2009 TO JUNE 2011. PREGNANT WOMEN WHO HAD TWIN PREGNANCIES, HAD MEDICAL RESTRICTIONS FOR EXERCISE, USED ANALGESICS, AND PARTICIPATED IN PHYSICAL THERAPY WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE STUDY. PREGNANT WOMEN WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: THE YOGA GROUP, PRACTICING EXERCISES GUIDED BY THIS METHOD, AND THE POSTURAL ORIENTATION GROUP, PERFORMING STANDARDIZED POSTURE ORIENTATION ACCORDING TO INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED IN A PAMPHLET. TREATMENT IN EACH GROUP LASTED 10 WEEKS. A VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS) WAS USED TO MEASURE PAIN INTENSITY. LUMBAR PAIN AND POSTERIOR PELVIC PAIN PROVOCATION TESTS WERE USED TO CONFIRM THE PRESENCE OF PAIN. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS INCLUDED THE MANN-WHITNEY TEST, THE MCNEMAR TEST, A PAIRED WILCOXON TEST, AND ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE. RESULTS: THE MEDIAN PAIN SCORE WAS LOWER IN THE YOGA GROUP (P<.0058) THAN THE POSTURAL ORIENTATION GROUP. LUMBAR PAIN PROVOCATION TESTS SHOWED A DECREASED RESPONSE IN RELATION TO POSTERIOR PELVIC PAIN PROVOCATION TESTS AND A GRADUAL REDUCTION IN PAIN INTENSITY DURING 10 YOGA SESSIONS (P<.024). CONCLUSIONS: THE YOGA METHOD WAS MORE EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING LUMBOPELVIC PAIN INTENSITY COMPARED WITH POSTURAL ORIENTATION.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
19 1889  32 REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE IMPROVES ANTIOXIDANT STATUS, IMMUNE FUNCTION, AND STRESS HORMONE RELEASES IN YOUNG HEALTHY PEOPLE: A RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE-BLIND, CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY IS TO HIGHLIGHT THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA PRACTICE ON BIO-PARAMETERS, SUCH AS OXIDATIVE STRESS, ANTIOXIDANT COMPONENTS, IMMUNE FUNCTIONS, AND SECRETION OF STRESS HORMONES, IN HEALTHY YOUNG PEOPLE. STUDY DESIGN: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS RECRUITED FROM AMONG UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, WHO WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: A CONTROL (NO YOGA INTERVENTION, N=13) GROUP AND A YOGA (N=12) GROUP. YOGA PRACTICE WAS WITH AN INSTRUCTOR FOR 90 MINUTES ONCE A WEEK SPREAD OVER 12 WEEKS, WITH RECOMMENDATIONS TO PRACTICE DAILY AT HOME FOR 40 MINUTES WITH THE HELP OF A DVD. THE YOGA PROGRAM CONSISTED OF YOGA BODY POSES (ASANAS), EXERCISES INVOLVING AWARENESS, VOLUNTARY REGULATION OF BREATH (PRANAYAMA), AND MEDITATIONAL PRACTICES. WHOLE BLOOD SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED WHEN THE VOLUNTEERS HAD FASTED FOR 8 HOURS AT 0 AND 12 WEEKS. THE OXIDATIVE STRESS/ANTIOXIDANT COMPONENTS, IMMUNE-RELATED CYTOKINES, AND STRESS HORMONES WERE EVALUATED IN SERUM OR PLASMA. RESULTS: SERUM LEVELS OF NITRIC OXIDE, F2-ISOPROSTANE, AND LIPID PEROXIDE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED BY YOGA PRACTICE (P<0.05 OR P=0.01), WHEREAS SERUM TOTAL GLUTATHIONE (GSH) CONTENTS, ACTIVITIES OF GSH-PEROXIDASE, AND GSH-S-TRANSFERASE WERE REMARKABLY INCREASED AFTER YOGA PRACTICE COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP (P<0.05 OR P=0.01). YOGA PRACTICE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IMMUNE-RELATED CYTOKINES, SUCH AS INTERLEUKIN-12, AND INTERFERON-GAMMA, IN SERUM (P<0.05 OR P=0.01). YOGA PRACTICE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE PLASMA LEVELS OF ADRENALIN (P<0.05) AND INCREASED PLASMA LEVELS OF SEROTONIN COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE REMARKABLY ATTENUATED OXIDATIVE STRESS AND IMPROVED ANTIOXIDANT LEVELS OF THE BODY. MOREOVER, YOGA BENEFICIALLY AFFECTED STRESS HORMONE RELEASES AS WELL AS PARTIALLY IMPROVED IMMUNE FUNCTION.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
20  818  33 EFFECT OF YOGA ON COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS IN CLIMACTERIC SYNDROME: A RANDOMISED CONTROL STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF AN INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY (IAYT) ON COGNITIVE ABILITIES IN CLIMACTERIC SYNDROME. DESIGN: A RANDOMISED CONTROL STUDY WHEREIN THE PARTICIPANTS WERE DIVIDED INTO EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUPS. SETTINGS: FOURTEEN CENTRES OF SWAMI VIVEKANANDA YOGA RESEARCH FOUNDATION, BANGALORE, INDIA. SAMPLE: ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHT PERIMENOPAUSAL WOMEN BETWEEN 40 AND 55 YEARS WITH FOLLICLE-STIMULATING HORMONE LEVEL EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN 15 MIU/ML. ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY PERIMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WERE RANDOMLY ALLOTTED INTO THE YOGA AND THE CONTROL GROUPS. METHODS: THE YOGA GROUP PRACTISED A MODULE COMPRISING BREATHING PRACTICES, SUN SALUTATION AND CYCLIC MEDITATION, WHEREAS THE CONTROL GROUP PRACTISED A SET OF SIMPLE PHYSICAL EXERCISES, UNDER SUPERVISION (1 HOUR/DAY, 5 DAYS/WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ASSESSMENTS WERE MADE BY VASOMOTOR SYMPTOM CHECKLIST, SIX-LETTER CANCELLATION TEST (SLCT) FOR ATTENTION AND CONCENTRATION AND PUNIT GOVIL INTELLIGENCE MEMORY SCALE (PGIMS) WITH TEN SUBTESTS. RESULTS: THE WILCOXON TEST SHOWED SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.001) REDUCTION IN HOT FLUSHES, NIGHT SWEATS AND SLEEP DISTURBANCE IN YOGA GROUP, WITH A TREND OF SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS AT P = 0.06 ON MANN-WHITNEY TEST IN NIGHT SWEATS. THERE WAS NO CHANGE WITHIN OR BETWEEN GROUPS IN THE CONTROL GROUP. THE SLCT SCORE AND THE PGIMS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN EIGHT OF TEN SUBTESTS IN THE YOGA GROUP AND SIX OF TEN SUBTESTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP. THE YOGA GROUP PERFORMED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER (P < 0.001) WITH HIGHER EFFECT SIZES IN SLCT AND SEVEN TESTS OF PGIMS COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY CAN IMPROVE HOT FLUSHES AND NIGHT SWEATS. IT ALSO CAN IMPROVE COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS SUCH AS REMOTE MEMORY, MENTAL BALANCE, ATTENTION AND CONCENTRATION, DELAYED AND IMMEDIATE RECALL, VERBAL RETENTION AND RECOGNITION TESTS.	2008

1  190 139 A RANDOMIZED STUDY OF YOGA THERAPY FOR THE PREVENTION OF RECURRENT REFLEX VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE. AIMS: VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE (VVS) IS A COMMON CARDIOVASCULAR DYSAUTONOMIC DISORDER THAT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTS HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE A POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON CARDIOVASCULAR AUTONOMICS. THIS STUDY ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA THERAPY ON THE RECURRENCE OF VVS AND QOL. METHODS AND RESULTS: WE RANDOMIZED SUBJECTS WITH RECURRENT REFLEX VVS (>3 EPISODES IN THE PAST 1 YEAR) AND POSITIVE HEAD-UP TILT TEST TO GUIDELINE-DIRECTED THERAPY (GROUP 1) OR YOGA THERAPY (GROUP 2). PATIENTS IN GROUP 1 WERE ADVISED GUIDELINE-DIRECTED TREATMENT AND GROUP 2 WAS TAUGHT YOGA BY A CERTIFIED INSTRUCTOR. THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT WAS VVS RECURRENCES AND QOL. BETWEEN JUNE 2015 AND FEBRUARY 2017, 97 HIGHLY SYMPTOMATIC VVS PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED (GROUP 1: 47 AND GROUP 2: 50). THE MEAN AGE WAS 33.1 +/- 16.6 YEARS, MALE:FEMALE OF 40:57, SYMPTOM DURATION OF 17.1 +/- 20.7 MONTHS, WITH A MEAN OF 6.4 +/- 6.1 SYNCOPE EPISODES. OVER A FOLLOW-UP OF 14.3 +/- 2.1 MONTHS GROUP 2 HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER SYNCOPE BURDEN COMPARED WITH GROUP 1 AT 3 (0.8 +/- 0.9 VS. 1.8 +/- 1.4, P < 0.001), 6 (1.0 +/- 1.2 VS. 3.4 +/- 3.0, P < 0.001), AND AT 12 MONTHS (1.1 +/- 0.8 VS. 3.8 +/- 3.2, P < 0.001). THE SYNCOPE FUNCTIONAL SCORE QUESTIONNAIRE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN GROUP 2 COMPARED WITH GROUP 1 AT 3 (31.4 +/- 7.2 VS. 64.1 +/- 11.5, P < 0.001), 6 (26.4 +/- 6.3 VS. 61.4 +/- 10.7, P < 0.001), AND 12 MONTHS (22.2 +/- 4.7 VS. 68.3 +/- 11.4, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: FOR PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT VVS, GUIDED YOGA THERAPY IS SUPERIOR TO CONVENTIONAL THERAPY IN REDUCING SYMPTOM BURDEN AND IMPROVING QOL.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
2 2471  47 YOGA AS A TREATMENT FOR VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: YOGA THERAPY IS BEING USED FOR VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE (VVS). HOWEVER, THERE IS NO SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE. WE AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT TO THE STANDARD THERAPY ON PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT VVS. METHODS: ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE SYSTEMATICALLY SEARCHED TO COLLECT STUDIES ASSESSING THE CLINICAL EFFECTS OF YOGA ALONG WITH GUIDELINE-DIRECTED TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT VVS. THE OUTCOMES WERE THE NUMBER OF VVS ATTACKS AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) ASSESSMENT BY SYNCOPE FUNCTIONAL STATUS QUESTIONNAIRE (SFSQ) SCORES AT 12 MONTHS. WE USED THE MANTEL- HAENSZEL RANDOM-EFFECTS MODEL TO CALCULATE THE MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI). WE USED THE COCHRANE COLLABORATION RISK OF BIAS TOOL AND NEWCASTLE-OTTAWA SCALE FOR RISK OF BIAS ASSESSMENT. RESULTS: FOUR STUDIES WERE INCLUDED, TWO RCTS AND TWO OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES. THE TOTAL OF PARTICIPANTS WAS 309, WITH A MEAN AGE OF 36.4 +/- 13.5 YEARS. THE MALE PARTICIPANTS REPRESENTED 141 (45.6%) BEING MALES. THE BASELINE SYNCOPE BURDEN WAS 3.5 +/- 2.38 EPISODES OVER 15.6 +/- 12.8 MONTHS. YOGA THERAPY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE NUMBER OF EPISODES OF SYNCOPE AND PRESYNCOPE COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP (MD -1.86; 95% CI -3.30, -0.43; P = 0.01). NEVERTHELESS, YOGA THERAPY DID NOT SHOW SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE QOL ASSESSED BY SFSQ SCORES (MD -30.69; 95% CI -62.22,0.83; P = 0.06). CONCLUSION: YOGA THERAPY IS A USEFUL LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION THAT CAN REDUCE THE FREQUENCY OF SYNCOPE AND PRESYNCOPE AMONG PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT VVS. HOWEVER, HIGHER-QUALITY RCTS ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM OUR RESULTS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
3  816  57 EFFECT OF YOGA ON CLINICAL OUTCOMES AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE (LIVE-YOGA). OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY AIMS TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT TO STANDARD THERAPY VERSUS STANDARD THERAPY ALONE ON THE SYMPTOMATIC BURDEN IN PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE (VVS). BACKGROUND: THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) OF PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT VVS. EXISTING MANAGEMENT THERAPIES HAVE BEEN LARGELY INEFFECTIVE. RECENT TRIALS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN DISEASES WITH AUTONOMIC IMBALANCE, SUGGESTING ITS POSSIBLE UTILITY IN VVS. METHODS: PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT VVS WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE EITHER A SPECIALIZED YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM IN ADDITION TO CURRENT GUIDELINE-BASED THERAPY (INTERVENTION ARM, GROUP 1) OR CURRENT GUIDELINE-BASED THERAPY ALONE (CONTROL ARM, GROUP 2). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS A COMPOSITE OF THE NUMBER OF EPISODES OF SYNCOPE AND PRESYNCOPE AT 12 MONTHS. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED QOL ASSESSMENT BY WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION QUALITY OF LIFE BRIEF FIELD QUESTIONNAIRE (WHOQOL-BREF) SCORES AND SYNCOPE FUNCTIONAL STATUS QUESTIONNAIRE SCORES AT 12 MONTHS, HEAD UP TILT TEST, AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY AT 6 WEEKS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 55 PATIENTS UNDERWENT RANDOMIZATION. THE MEAN NUMBER OF SYNCOPAL OR PRESYNCOPAL EVENTS AT 12 MONTHS WAS 0.7 +/- 0.7 IN THE INTERVENTION ARM COMPARED TO 2.52 +/- 1.93 IN THE CONTROL ARM (P < 0.01). IN THE INTERVENTION ARM, 13 (43.3%) PATIENTS REMAINED FREE OF EVENTS VERSUS 4 (16.0%) PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL ARM (P = 0.02). QOL AT 12 MONTHS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OF ALL SYNCOPE FUNCTIONAL STATUS QUESTIONNAIRE SCORES AND 2 DOMAINS OF WHOQOL-BREF SCORES (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: YOGA AS ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY IS SUPERIOR TO STANDARD THERAPY ALONE IN REDUCING THE SYMPTOMATIC BURDEN AND IMPROVING QOL IN PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT VVS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
4 1923  51 ROLE OF YOGA AS AN ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH NEUROCARDIOGENIC SYNCOPE: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: NEUROCARDIOGENIC SYNCOPE (NCS) IS A COMMON CLINICAL CONDITION CHARACTERIZED BY ABRUPT CARDIOVASCULAR AUTONOMIC CHANGES RESULTING IN SYNCOPE. THIS IS A RECURRING CONDITION WITH MIXED RESULTS FROM CURRENT STRATEGIES OF TREATMENT. METHODS: SUBJECTS WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF NCS WERE SCREENED AND ENROLLED. ALL THE PARTICIPANTS WERE GIVEN A DVD CONTAINING YOGA VIDEOS AND WERE INSTRUCTED TO PRACTICE YOGA THERAPY FOR 60 MIN, THREE TIMES A WEEK FOR 3 CONSECUTIVE MONTHS. SYNCOPE FUNCTIONAL STATUS QUESTIONNAIRE SCORE (SFSQS) WAS ADMINISTERED AT THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF THE STUDY. THE SUBJECTS WERE FOLLOWED FOR 3 MONTHS AND UNDERWENT REPEAT TILT TABLE TESTING AT THE END OF THE STUDY. RESULTS: OF THE 60 PATIENTS SCREENED, 44 SUBJECTS WERE ENROLLED, 21 IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP AND 23 IN THE CONTROL GROUP. MOST OF THE PARTICIPANTS WERE FEMALES, AND THE MEAN AGE WAS 21 +/- 3 YEARS. IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP, WHO FINISHED THE YOGA REGIMEN, THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT FROM CONTROL PHASE TO THE INTERVENTION PHASE, IN NUMBER OF EPISODES OF SYNCOPE (4 +/- 1 VS 1.3 +/- 0.7, P < 0.001) AND PRESYNCOPE (4.7 +/- 1.5 VS 1.5 +/- 0.5, P < 0.001). THE MEAN SFSQS ALSO DECREASED FROM 67 +/- 7.8 TO 29.8 +/- 4.6 (P < 0.001). ALL SUBJECTS HAD POSITIVE HEAD UP TILT TABLE (HUTT) STUDY AT THE TIME OF ENROLLMENT COMPARED TO ONLY SIX PATIENTS AT THE COMPLETION OF INTERVENTION PHASE (10/100 VS 6/28 %, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: YOGA THERAPY CAN POTENTIALLY IMPROVE THE SYMPTOMS OF PRESYNCOPE AND SYNCOPE IN YOUNG FEMALE PATIENTS WITH NCS.	2015

CONCLUSIONS: YOGA THERAPY MAY BENEFIT TO REDUCE THE HEADACHE FREQUENCY OF MIGRAINE PATIENTS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
6  807  43 EFFECT OF YOGA ON ARRHYTHMIA BURDEN, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: THE YOGA MY HEART STUDY. OBJECTIVES: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AF) BURDEN, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), DEPRESSION, AND ANXIETY SCORES. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS KNOWN TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT ON CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH. THE EFFECT OF YOGA IN REDUCING AF BURDEN IS UNKNOWN. METHODS: THIS SINGLE-CENTER, PRE-POST STUDY ENROLLED PATIENTS WITH SYMPTOMATIC PAROXYSMAL AF WITH AN INITIAL 3-MONTH NONINTERVENTIONAL OBSERVATION PERIOD FOLLOWED BY TWICE-WEEKLY 60-MIN YOGA TRAINING FOR NEXT 3 MONTHS. AF EPISODES DURING THE CONTROL AND STUDY PERIODS AS WELL AS SF-36, ZUNG SELF-RATED ANXIETY, AND ZUNG SELF-RATED DEPRESSION SCORES AT BASELINE, BEFORE, AND AFTER THE STUDY PHASE WERE ASSESSED. RESULTS: YOGA TRAINING REDUCED SYMPTOMATIC AF EPISODES (3.8 +/- 3 VS. 2.1 +/- 2.6, P < 0.001), SYMPTOMATIC NON-AF EPISODES (2.9 +/- 3.4 VS. 1.4 +/- 2.0; P < 0.001), ASYMPTOMATIC AF EPISODES (0.12 +/- 0.44 VS. 0.04 +/- 0.20; P < 0.001), AND DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY (P < 0.001), AND IMPROVED THE QOL PARAMETERS OF PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING, GENERAL HEALTH, VITALITY, SOCIAL FUNCTIONING, AND MENTAL HEALTH DOMAINS ON SF-36 (P = 0.017, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P = 0.019, AND P < 0.001, RESPECTIVELY). THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN HEART RATE, AND SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: IN PATIENTS WITH PAROXYSMAL AF, YOGA IMPROVES SYMPTOMS, ARRHYTHMIA BURDEN, HEART RATE, BLOOD PRESSURE, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCORES, AND SEVERAL DOMAINS OF QOL.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
7 2633  29 YOGA FOR TREATING HEADACHES: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: HEADACHE DISORDERS ARE CURRENTLY THE SIXTH LEADING CAUSE OF DISABILITY ACROSS THE GLOBE AND THEREFORE CARRY A SIGNIFICANT DISEASE BURDEN. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON HEADACHE DISORDERS. METHODS: MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, AND PSYCINFO WERE SCREENED THROUGH MAY 2019. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) WERE INCLUDED WHEN THEY ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF CHRONIC OR EPISODIC HEADACHE (TENSION-TYPE HEADACHE AND/OR MIGRAINE). USUAL CARE (NO SPECIFIC TREATMENT) OR ANY ACTIVE TREATMENTS WERE ACCEPTABLE AS CONTROL INTERVENTIONS. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES WERE HEADACHE FREQUENCY, HEADACHE DURATION, AND PAIN INTENSITY. FOR EACH OUTCOME, STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCES (SMD) AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CI) WERE CALCULATED. RESULTS: META-ANALYSIS REVEALED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT OVERALL EFFECT IN FAVOR OF YOGA FOR HEADACHE FREQUENCY (5 RCTS; STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE (SMD) = - 1.97; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) - 2.75 TO - 1.20; I(2) = 63.0%, TAU(2) = 0.25, P = 0.03), HEADACHE DURATION (4 RCTS; SMD = - 1.45; 95% CI - 2.54 TO - 0.37; I(2) = 69.0%, TAU(2) = 0.33, P = 0.02), AND PAIN INTENSITY (5 RCTS; SMD = - 3.43; 95% CI - 6.08 TO - 0.70, I(2) = 95.0%, TAU(2) = 4.25, P < 0.01). THE SIGNIFICANT OVERALL EFFECT WAS MAINLY DUE TO PATIENTS WITH TENSION-TYPE HEADACHES. FOR PATIENTS WITH MIGRAINE, NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT WAS OBSERVED. DISCUSSION: DESPITE DISCUSSED LIMITATIONS, THIS REVIEW FOUND PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE OF SHORT-TERM EFFICACY OF YOGA IN IMPROVING HEADACHE FREQUENCY, HEADACHE DURATION, AND PAIN INTENSITY IN PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM TENSION-TYPE HEADACHES. FURTHER STUDIES ARE URGENTLY NEEDED TO DRAW DEEPER CONCLUSIONS FROM THE AVAILABLE RESULTS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
8 2614  34 YOGA FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: THE AIM OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEW AND META-ANALYZE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SYMPTOMS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA, QUALITY OF LIFE, FUNCTION, AND HOSPITALIZATION IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA. METHODS: MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, PSYCINFO, AND INDMED WERE SCREENED THROUGH AUGUST 2012. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) COMPARING YOGA TO USUAL CARE OR NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS WERE ANALYZED WHEN THEY ASSESSED SYMPTOMS OR QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA. COGNITIVE FUNCTION, SOCIAL FUNCTION, HOSPITALIZATION, AND SAFETY WERE DEFINED AS SECONDARY OUTCOMES. RISK OF BIAS WAS ASSESSED USING THE RISK OF BIAS TOOL RECOMMENDED BY THE COCHRANE BACK REVIEW GROUP. STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCES (SMD) AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CI) WERE CALCULATED. RESULTS: FIVE RCTS WITH A TOTAL OF 337 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED; 2 RCTS HAD LOW RISK OF BIAS. TWO RCTS COMPARED YOGA TO USUAL CARE; 1 RCT COMPARED YOGA TO EXERCISE; AND 2 3-ARM RCTS COMPARED YOGA TO USUAL CARE AND EXERCISE. NO EVIDENCE WAS FOUND FOR SHORT-TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA COMPARED TO USUAL CARE ON POSITIVE SYMPTOMS (SMD = -0.58; 95% CI -1.52 TO 0.37; P = 0.23), OR NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS (SMD = -0.59; 95% CI -1.87 TO 0.69; P = 0.36). MODERATE EVIDENCE WAS FOUND FOR SHORT-TERM EFFECTS ON QUALITY OF LIFE COMPARED TO USUAL CARE (SMD = 2.28; 95% CI 0.42 TO 4.14; P = 0.02). THESE EFFECTS WERE ONLY PRESENT IN STUDIES WITH HIGH RISK OF BIAS. NO EVIDENCE WAS FOUND FOR SHORT-TERM EFFECTS ON SOCIAL FUNCTION (SMD = 1.20; 95% CI -0.78 TO 3.18; P = 0.23). COMPARING YOGA TO EXERCISE, NO EVIDENCE WAS FOUND FOR SHORT-TERM EFFECTS ON POSITIVE SYMPTOMS (SMD = -0.35; 95% CI -0.75 TO 0.05; P = 0.09), NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS (SMD = -0.28; 95% CI -1.42 TO 0.86; P = 0.63), QUALITY OF LIFE (SMD = 0.17; 95% CI -0.27 TO 0.61; P = 0.45), OR SOCIAL FUNCTION (SMD = 0.20; 95% CI -0.27 TO 0.67; P = 0.41). ONLY 1 RCT REPORTED ADVERSE EVENTS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW FOUND ONLY MODERATE EVIDENCE FOR SHORT-TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE. AS THESE EFFECTS WERE NOT CLEARLY DISTINGUISHABLE FROM BIAS AND SAFETY OF THE INTERVENTION WAS UNCLEAR, NO RECOMMENDATION CAN BE MADE REGARDING YOGA AS A ROUTINE INTERVENTION FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA PATIENTS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
9  779  43 EFFECT OF YOGA AS ADD-ON THERAPY IN MIGRAINE (CONTAIN): A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AS AN ADJUVANT TO CONVENTIONAL MEDICAL MANAGEMENT ON CLINICAL OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS WITH MIGRAINE. METHODS: CONTAIN WAS A PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, OPEN-LABEL SUPERIORITY TRIAL WITH BLINDED ENDPOINT ASSESSMENT CARRIED OUT AT A SINGLE TERTIARY CARE ACADEMIC HOSPITAL IN NEW DELHI, INDIA. PATIENTS ENROLLED WERE AGED 18-50 YEARS WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF EPISODIC MIGRAINE AND WERE RANDOMIZED INTO MEDICAL AND YOGA GROUPS (1:1). RANDOMIZATION WAS COMPUTER-GENERATED WITH A VARIABLE BLOCK SIZE AND CONCEALED. A PREDESIGNED YOGA INTERVENTION WAS GIVEN FOR 3 MONTHS. OUTCOMES WERE RECORDED BY A BLINDED ASSESSOR. THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT WAS A DECREASE IN HEADACHE FREQUENCY, HEADACHE INTENSITY, AND HEADACHE IMPACT TEST (HIT)-6 SCORE. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED CHANGE IN MIGRAINE DISABILITY ASSESSMENT (MIDAS) SCORE, PILL COUNT, AND PROPORTION OF HEADACHE FREE PATIENTS. RESULTS: BETWEEN APRIL 2017 AND AUGUST 2018, 160 PATIENTS WITH EPISODIC MIGRAINE WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO MEDICAL AND YOGA GROUPS. A TOTAL OF 114 PATIENTS COMPLETED THE TRIAL. BASELINE MEASURES WERE COMPARABLE EXCEPT FOR A HIGHER MEAN HEADACHE FREQUENCY IN THE YOGA GROUP. COMPARED TO MEDICAL THERAPY, THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT MEAN DELTA VALUE REDUCTION IN HEADACHE FREQUENCY (DELTA DIFFERENCE 3.53 [95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL 2.52-4.54]; P < 0.0001), HEADACHE INTENSITY (1.31 [0.60-2.01]; P = 0.0004), HIT SCORE (8.0 [4.78-11.22]; P < 0.0001), MIDAS SCORE (7.85 [4.98-10.97]; P < 0.0001), AND PILL COUNT (2.28 [1.06-3.51]; P < 0.0003). CONCLUSION: YOGA AS AN ADD-ON THERAPY IN MIGRAINE IS SUPERIOR TO MEDICAL THERAPY ALONE. IT MAY BE USEFUL TO INTEGRATE A COST-EFFECTIVE AND SAFE INTERVENTION LIKE YOGA INTO THE MANAGEMENT OF MIGRAINE. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: CTRI/2017/03/008041. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: THIS STUDY PROVIDES CLASS III EVIDENCE THAT FOR PATIENTS WITH EPISODIC MIGRAINE, YOGA AS ADJUVANT TO MEDICAL THERAPY IMPROVES HEADACHE FREQUENCY, INTENSITY, IMPACT, AND DISABILITY.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
10 1033  24 EFFECTS OF YOGA IN ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS: A META-ANALYSIS. AIMS/INTRODUCTION: A META-ANALYSIS WAS CARRIED OUT TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE PUBMED, EMBASE AND COCHRANE DATABASES WERE SEARCHED TO OBTAIN ELIGIBLE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE, AND THE SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN A1C, TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL, LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDE AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE. WEIGHTED MEAN DIFFERENCES AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CIS) WERE CALCULATED. THE I(2) STATISTIC REPRESENTED HETEROGENEITY. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 12 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WITH A TOTAL OF 864 PATIENTS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. THE POOLED WEIGHTED MEAN DIFFERENCES WERE -23.72 MG/DL (95% CI -37.78 TO -9.65; P = 0.001; I(2) = 82%) FOR FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE AND -0.47% (95% CI -0.87 TO -0.07; P = 0.02; I(2) = 82%) FOR HEMOGLOBIN A1C. THE WEIGHTED MEAN DIFFERENCES WERE -17.38 MG/DL (95% CI -27.88 TO -6.89; P = 0.001; I(2) = 0%) FOR POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE, -18.50 MG/DL (95% CI -29.88 TO -7.11; P = 0.001; I(2) = 75%) FOR TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, 4.30 MG/DL (95% CI 3.25 TO 5.36; P < 0.00001; I(2) = 10%) FOR HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL, -12.95 MG/DL (95% CI -18.84 TO -7.06; P < 0.0001; I(2) = 37%) FOR LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL AND -12.57 MG/DL (95% CI -29.91 TO 4.76; P = 0.16; I(2) = 48%) FOR TRIGLYCERIDES. CONCLUSIONS: THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT YOGA BENEFITS ADULT PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS. HOWEVER, CONSIDERING THE LIMITED METHODOLOGY AND THE POTENTIAL HETEROGENEITY, FURTHER STUDIES ARE NECESSARY TO SUPPORT OUR FINDINGS AND INVESTIGATE THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA IN TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS PATIENTS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
11 2544  31 YOGA FOR ASTHMA: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: ALTHOUGH YOGA IS FREQUENTLY USED BY PATIENTS WITH ASTHMA, ITS EFFICACY IN ALLEVIATING ASTHMA REMAINS UNCLEAR. OBJECTIVE: TO SYSTEMATICALLY ASSESS AND META-ANALYZE THE AVAILABLE DATA ON EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF YOGA IN ALLEVIATING ASTHMA. METHODS: MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS, PSYCINFO, CAM-QUEST, CAMBASE, AND INDMED WERE SEARCHED THROUGH JANUARY 2014. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS OF YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH ASTHMA WERE INCLUDED IF THEY ASSESSED ASTHMA CONTROL, SYMPTOMS, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND/OR PULMONARY FUNCTION. FOR EACH OUTCOME, STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCES (SMDS) OR RISK RATIOS (RRS) AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CIS) WERE CALCULATED. RISK OF BIAS WAS ASSESSED USING THE COCHRANE TOOL. RESULTS: FOURTEEN RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WITH 824 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED. EVIDENCE FOR EFFECTS OF YOGA COMPARED WITH USUAL CARE WAS FOUND FOR ASTHMA CONTROL (RR, 10.64; 95% CI, 1.98 TO 57.19; P = .006), ASTHMA SYMPTOMS (SMD, -0.37; 95% CI, -0.55 TO -0.19; P < .001), QUALITY OF LIFE (SMD, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.39 TO 1.33; P < .001), PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (SMD, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.32 TO 0.67; P < .001), AND RATIO OF FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1 SECOND TO FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (SMD, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.24 TO 0.75; P < .001); EVIDENCE FOR EFFECTS OF YOGA COMPARED WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS WAS FOUND FOR QUALITY OF LIFE (SMD, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.22 TO 0.99; P = .002) AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (SMD, 2.87; 95% CI, 0.14 TO 5.60; P = .04). NO EVIDENCE FOR EFFECTS OF YOGA COMPARED WITH SHAM YOGA OR BREATHING EXERCISES WAS REVEALED. NO EFFECT WAS ROBUST AGAINST ALL POTENTIAL SOURCES OF BIAS. YOGA WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS. CONCLUSION: YOGA CANNOT BE CONSIDERED A ROUTINE INTERVENTION FOR ASTHMATIC PATIENTS AT THIS POINT. IT CAN BE CONSIDERED AN ANCILLARY INTERVENTION OR AN ALTERNATIVE TO BREATHING EXERCISES FOR ASTHMA PATIENTS INTERESTED IN COMPLEMENTARY INTERVENTIONS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
12 2546  34 YOGA FOR BREAST CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: MANY BREAST CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS USE YOGA TO COPE WITH THEIR DISEASE. THE AIM OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO SYSTEMATICALLY ASSESS AND META-ANALYZE THE EVIDENCE FOR EFFECTS OF YOGA ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS. METHODS: MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, EMBASE, CAMBASE, AND THE COCHRANE LIBRARY WERE SCREENED THROUGH FEBRUARY 2012. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) COMPARING YOGA TO CONTROLS WERE ANALYZED WHEN THEY ASSESSED HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE OR PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS OR SURVIVORS. RISK OF BIAS WAS ASSESSED USING THE COCHRANE RISK OF BIAS TOOL. STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCES (SMD) AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CI) WERE CALCULATED. RESULTS: TWELVE RCTS WITH A TOTAL OF 742 PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED. SEVEN RCTS COMPARED YOGA TO NO TREATMENT; 3 RCTS COMPARED YOGA TO SUPPORTIVE THERAPY; 1 RCT COMPARED YOGA TO HEALTH EDUCATION; AND 1 RCT COMPARED A COMBINATION OF PHYSIOTHERAPY AND YOGA TO PHYSIOTHERAPY ALONE. EVIDENCE WAS FOUND FOR SHORT-TERM EFFECTS ON GLOBAL HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (SMD = 0.62 [95% CI: 0.04 TO 1.21]; P = 0.04), FUNCTIONAL (SMD = 0.30 [95% CI: 0.03 TO 0.57), SOCIAL (SMD = 0.29 [95% CI: 0.08 TO 0.50]; P < 0.01), AND SPIRITUAL WELL-BEING (SMD = 0.41 [95% CI: 0.08; 0.74]; P = 0.01). THESE EFFECTS WERE, HOWEVER, ONLY PRESENT IN STUDIES WITH UNCLEAR OR HIGH RISK OF SELECTION BIAS. SHORT-TERM EFFECTS ON PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH ALSO WERE FOUND: ANXIETY (SMD = -1.51 [95% CI: -2.47; -0.55]; P < 0.01), DEPRESSION (SMD = -1.59 [95% CI: -2.68 TO -0.51]; P < 0.01), PERCEIVED STRESS (SMD = -1.14 [95% CI:-2.16; -0.12]; P = 0.03), AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS (SMD = -0.86 [95% CI:-1.50; -0.22]; P < 0.01). SUBGROUP ANALYSES REVEALED EVIDENCE OF EFFICACY ONLY FOR YOGA DURING ACTIVE CANCER TREATMENT BUT NOT AFTER COMPLETION OF ACTIVE TREATMENT. CONCLUSIONS: THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW FOUND EVIDENCE FOR SHORT-TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA IN IMPROVING PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. THE SHORT-TERM EFFECTS ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE COULD NOT BE CLEARLY DISTINGUISHED FROM BIAS. YOGA CAN BE RECOMMENDED AS AN INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH DURING BREAST CANCER TREATMENT.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
13 1139  22 EFFICACY OF YOGA TRAINING IN CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE PATIENTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVES: TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF YOGA TRAINING IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD). METHOD: A LITERATURE SEARCH WAS PERFORMED IN PUBMED, COCHRANE LIBRARY, EMBASE, CINAHL, AND WEB OF SCIENCE FOR RELEVANT STUDIES PUBLISHED BEFORE JUNE 2017. QUALITY ASSESSMENT, SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS AND HETEROGENEITY WERE PERFORMED. STATA12.0 SOFTWARE WAS USED FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. RESULTS: TEN STUDIES WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS ANALYSIS. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN 6MWD (P = 0.000), BORG SCALE SCORES (P = 0.018), FEV1 VALUE (P = 0. 013), PACO2 (P = 0.037), SGRQ SCORES (P = 0. 000) AND CAT SCORES (P = 0.009) IN YOGA TRAINING PATIENTS. NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED IN THE FEV1/FVC (P = 0.75), FEV1 PREDICTED VALUE (P = 0.057) AND FVC (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: THIS META-ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT YOGA TRAINING CAN BE AN ACCEPTABLE AND APPROPRIATED ADJUNCTIVE REHABILITATION PROGRAM FOR COPD PATIENTS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
14 2634  29 YOGA FOR TREATING LOW BACK PAIN: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. ABSTRACT: YOGA IS FREQUENTLY USED FOR BACK PAIN RELIEF. HOWEVER, THE EVIDENCE WAS JUDGED TO BE OF ONLY LOW TO MODERATE CERTAINTY. TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH LOW BACK PAIN, A META-ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED. THEREFORE, MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, AND THE COCHRANE LIBRARY WERE SEARCHED TO MAY 26, 2020. ONLY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS COMPARING YOGA WITH PASSIVE CONTROL (USUAL CARE OR WAIT LIST), OR AN ACTIVE COMPARATOR, FOR PATIENTS WITH LOW BACK PAIN AND THAT ASSESSED PAIN INTENSITY OR PAIN-RELATED DISABILITY AS A PRIMARY OUTCOME WERE CONSIDERED TO BE ELIGIBLE. TWO REVIEWERS INDEPENDENTLY EXTRACTED DATA ON STUDY CHARACTERISTICS, OUTCOME MEASURES, AND RESULTS AT SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP. RISK OF BIAS WAS ASSESSED USING THE COCHRANE RISK OF BIAS TOOL. THIRTY ARTICLES ON 27 INDIVIDUAL STUDIES (2702 PARTICIPANTS IN TOTAL) PROVED ELIGIBLE FOR REVIEW. COMPARED WITH PASSIVE CONTROL, YOGA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SHORT-TERM IMPROVEMENTS IN PAIN INTENSITY (15 RCTS; MEAN DIFFERENCE [MD] = -0.74 POINTS ON A NUMERIC RATING SCALE; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI] = -1.04 TO -0.44; STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE [SMD] = -0.37 95% CI = -0.52 TO -0.22), PAIN-RELATED DISABILITY (15 RCTS; MD = -2.28; 95% CI = -3.30 TO -1.26; SMD = -0.38 95% CI = -0.55 TO -0.21), MENTAL HEALTH (7 RCTS; MD = 1.70; 95% CI = 0.20-3.20; SMD = 0.17 95% CI = 0.02-0.32), AND PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING (9 RCTS; MD = 2.80; 95% CI = 1.00-4.70; SMD = 0.28 95% CI = 0.10-0.47). EXCEPT FOR MENTAL HEALTH, ALL EFFECTS WERE SUSTAINED LONG-TERM. COMPARED WITH AN ACTIVE COMPARATOR, YOGA WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH ANY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN SHORT-TERM OR LONG-TERM OUTCOMES.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
15 2180  32 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PATIENTS WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE: A META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. METHODS: A META-ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED BY SYSTEMATICALLY SEARCHING PUBMED, EMBASE, AND COCHRANE LIBRARY DATABASES TILL AUGUST 2020 FOR STUDIES PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH. THE REFERENCE LISTS OF ELIGIBLE STUDIES WERE ALSO SEARCHED. THE MOTOR SYMPTOMS (UPDRS-PART III), BALANCE FUNCTION (BBS AND BESTEST), FUNCTIONAL MOBILITY (TUG), ANXIETY (HADS AND BAI), DEPRESSION (HADS AND BDI), AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE (PDQ-39 AND PDQ-8) WERE THE PRIMARY EVALUATION INDEXES. RESULTS: TEN STUDIES INCLUDING 359 PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED IN THIS META-ANALYSIS. THE POOLED RESULTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE YOGA TRAINING GROUP AND THE CONTROL GROUP. PATIENTS IN THE YOGA TRAINING GROUP HAD BETTER FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES IN TERMS OF MOTOR STATUS (MD = -5.64; 95% CI, -8.57 TO -2.7), BALANCE FUNCTION (SMD = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.08 TO 0.77), FUNCTIONAL MOBILITY (MD = -1.71; 95% CI, -2.58 TO -0.84), ANXIETY SCALE SCORES (SMD = -0.72; 95% CI, -1.01 TO -0.43), DEPRESSION SCALE SCORES (SMD = -0.92; 95% CI, -1.22 TO -0.62), AND QOL (SMD = -0.54; 95% CI, -0.97 TO -0.11). CONCLUSION: OUR POOLED RESULTS SHOWED THE BENEFITS OF YOGA IN IMPROVING MOTOR FUNCTION, BALANCE, FUNCTIONAL MOBILITY, REDUCING ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, AND INCREASING QOL IN PD PATIENTS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
16 2271  33 THE RISKS AND BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVES: TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND SAFETY OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON DISEASE SYMPTOMS, QUALITY OF LIFE AND FUNCTION IN PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD). DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, AND CENTRAL (COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS) WERE SEARCHED THROUGH 6 JUNE 2019. REVIEW METHODS: RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS ASSESSING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE, DYSPNEA, EXERCISE CAPACITY, AND PULMONARY FUNCTION (FEV1) IN PATIENTS WITH COPD WERE INCLUDED. SAFETY WAS DEFINED AS SECONDARY OUTCOME. MEAN DIFFERENCES (MD) AND STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCES (SMD) WITH 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CIS) WERE COMPUTED. RISK OF BIAS WAS ASSESSED USING THE COCHRANE TOOL. RESULTS: ELEVEN RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WITH A TOTAL OF 586 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED. META-ANALYSIS REVEALED EVIDENCE FOR EFFECTS OF YOGA COMPARED TO NO TREATMENT ON QUALITY OF LIFE ON THE COPD ASSESSMENT TEST (MD = 3.81; 95% CI = 0.97 TO 6.65; P = 0.009, I(2) = 70%), EXERCISE CAPACITY ASSESSED BY THE 6-MINUTE WALK TEST (MD = 25.53 M; 95% CI = 12.16 M TO 38.90 M; P = 0.001, I(2) = 0%), AND PULMONARY FUNCTION ASSESSED BY FEV1 PREDICTED (MD = 3.95%; 95% CI = 2.74% TO 5.17%; P < 0.001, I(2) = 0%). ONLY THE EFFECTS ON EXERCISE CAPACITY AND PULMONARY FUNCTION WERE ROBUST AGAINST METHODOLOGICAL BIAS. EFFECTS WERE ONLY PRESENT IN BREATHING-FOCUSED YOGA INTERVENTIONS BUT NOT IN INTERVENTIONS INCLUDING YOGA POSTURES. ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED INFREQUENTLY. CONCLUSION: THIS META-ANALYSIS FOUND ROBUST EFFECTS OF YOGA ON EXERCISE CAPACITY AND PULMONARY FUNCTION IN PATIENTS WITH COPD. YOGA, SPECIFICALLY YOGA BREATHING TECHNIQUES, CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE ADJUNCT INTERVENTION FOR PATIENTS WITH COPD. YOGA'S SAFETY NEEDS TO BE ASSESSED IN MORE DEPTH IN FUTURE STUDIES.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
17  167  36 A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED BICENTER TRIAL OF YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH COLORECTAL CANCER. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS TRIAL WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH COLORECTAL CANCER. METHODS: PATIENTS WITH NON-METASTATIC COLORECTAL CANCER WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A 10-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION (90 MIN ONCE WEEKLY) OR A WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS DISEASE-SPECIFIC QUALITY OF LIFE (FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CANCER THERAPY - COLORECTAL [FACT-C]) AT WEEK 10. SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED FACT-C SUBSCALES: SPIRITUAL WELL-BEING (FACT - SPIRITUALITY); FATIGUE (FACT - FATIGUE); SLEEP DISTURBANCES (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INVENTORY); DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY (HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE); BODY AWARENESS (SCALE OF BODY CONNECTION); AND BODY-EFFICACY EXPECTATIONS (BODY-EFFICACY EXPECTATIONS SCALE). OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED AT WEEK 10 AND WEEK 22 AFTER RANDOMIZATION. RESULTS: FIFTY-FOUR PATIENTS (MEAN AGE 68.3 +/- 9.7 YEARS) WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA (N = 27; ATTRITION RATE 22.2%) AND CONTROL GROUP (N = 27; ATTRITION RATE 18.5%). PATIENTS IN THE YOGA GROUP ATTENDED A MEAN OF 5.3 +/- 4.0 YOGA CLASSES. NO SIGNIFICANT GROUP DIFFERENCES FOR THE FACT-C TOTAL SCORE WERE FOUND. GROUP DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND FOR EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING AT WEEK 22 ( = 1.59; 95% CI = 0.27,2.90; P = 0.019), SLEEP DISTURBANCES AT WEEK 22 ( = -1.08; 95% CI = -2.13, -0.03; P = 0.043), ANXIETY AT WEEK 10 ( = -1.14; 95% CI = -2.20, -0.09; P = 0.043), AND DEPRESSION AT WEEK 10 ( = -1.34; 95% CI = -2.61, -0.8; P = 0.038). NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS OCCURRED IN THE YOGA GROUP, WHILE LIVER METASTASES WERE DIAGNOSED IN ONE PATIENT IN THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: THIS RANDOMIZED TRIAL FOUND NO EFFECTS OF YOGA ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH COLORECTAL CANCER. GIVEN THE HIGH ATTRITION RATE AND LOW INTERVENTION ADHERENCE, NO DEFINITE CONCLUSIONS CAN BE DRAWN FROM THIS TRIAL.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
18 2518  48 YOGA COMPARED TO NON-EXERCISE OR PHYSICAL THERAPY EXERCISE ON PAIN, DISABILITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) IS A COMMON AND OFTEN DISABLING MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITION. YOGA HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE AN EFFECTIVE THERAPY FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. HOWEVER, THERE ARE STILL CONTROVERSIES ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AT DIFFERENT FOLLOW-UP PERIODS AND COMPARED WITH OTHER PHYSICAL THERAPY EXERCISES. OBJECTIVE: TO CRITICALLY COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN ON PAIN, DISABILITY, QUALITY OF LIFE WITH NON-EXERCISE (E.G. USUAL CARE, EDUCATION), PHYSICAL THERAPY EXERCISE. METHODS: THIS STUDY WAS REGISTERED IN PROSPERO, AND THE REGISTRATION NUMBER WAS CRD42020159865. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) OF ONLINE DATABASES INCLUDED PUBMED, WEB OF SCIENCE, COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS, EMBASE WHICH EVALUATED EFFECTS OF YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN ON PAIN, DISABILITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE WERE SEARCHED FROM INCEPTION TIME TO NOVEMBER 1, 2019. STUDIES WERE ELIGIBLE IF THEY ASSESSED AT LEAST ONE IMPORTANT OUTCOME, NAMELY PAIN, BACK-SPECIFIC DISABILITY, QUALITY OF LIFE. THE COCHRANE RISK OF BIAS TOOL WAS USED TO ASSESS THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF INCLUDED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. THE CONTINUOUS OUTCOMES WERE ANALYZED BY CALCULATING THE MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) OR STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE (SMD) WITH 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CI) ACCORDING TO WHETHER COMBINING OUTCOMES MEASURED ON DIFFERENT SCALES OR NOT. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 18 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE INCLUDED IN THIS META-ANALYSIS. YOGA COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE PAIN AT 4 TO 8 WEEKS (MD = -0.83, 95% CI = -1.19 TO -0.48, P<0.00001, I2 = 0%), 3 MONTHS (MD = -0.43, 95% CI = -0.64 TO -0.23, P<0.0001, I2 = 0%), 6 TO 7 MONTHS (MD = -0.56, 95% CI = -1.02 TO -0.11, P = 0.02, I2 = 50%), AND WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT IN 12 MONTHS (MD = -0.52, 95% CI = -1.64 TO 0.59, P = 0.36, I2 = 87%) COMPARED WITH NON-EXERCISE. YOGA WAS BETTER THAN NON-EXERCISE ON DISABILITY AT 4 TO 8 WEEKS (SMD = -0.30, 95% CI = -0.51 TO -0.10, P = 0.003, I2 = 0%), 3 MONTHS (SMD = -0.31, 95% CI = -0.45 TO -0.18, P<0.00001, I2 = 30%), 6 MONTHS (SMD = -0.38, 95% CI = -0.53 TO -0.23, P<0.00001, I2 = 0%), 12 MONTHS (SMD = -0.33, 95% CI = -0.54 TO -0.12, P = 0.002, I2 = 9%). THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE ON PAIN, DISABILITY COMPARED WITH PHYSICAL THERAPY EXERCISE GROUP. FURTHERMORE, IT SUGGESTED THAT THERE WAS A NON-SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE ON PHYSICAL AND MENTAL QUALITY OF LIFE BETWEEN YOGA AND ANY OTHER INTERVENTIONS. CONCLUSION: THIS META-ANALYSIS PROVIDED EVIDENCE FROM VERY LOW TO MODERATE INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN PATIENTS AT DIFFERENT TIME POINTS. YOGA MIGHT DECREASE PAIN FROM SHORT TERM TO INTERMEDIATE TERM AND IMPROVE FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY STATUS FROM SHORT TERM TO LONG TERM COMPARED WITH NON-EXERCISE (E.G. USUAL CARE, EDUCATION). YOGA HAD THE SAME EFFECT ON PAIN AND DISABILITY AS ANY OTHER EXERCISE OR PHYSICAL THERAPY. YOGA MIGHT NOT IMPROVE THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL QUALITY OF LIFE BASED ON THE RESULT OF A MERGING.	2020	

19   74  39 A GROUP-BASED YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION FOR URINARY INCONTINENCE IN WOMEN: A PILOT RANDOMIZED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY, EFFICACY, AND SAFETY OF A GROUP-BASED YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION FOR MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER WOMEN WITH URINARY INCONTINENCE. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A PILOT RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF AMBULATORY WOMEN AGED 40 YEARS AND OLDER WITH STRESS, URGENCY, OR MIXED-TYPE INCONTINENCE. WOMEN WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 6-WEEK YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM (N = 10) CONSISTING OF TWICE WEEKLY GROUP CLASSES AND ONCE WEEKLY HOME PRACTICE OR A WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 9). ALL PARTICIPANTS ALSO RECEIVED WRITTEN PAMPHLETS ABOUT STANDARD BEHAVIORAL SELF-MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES FOR INCONTINENCE. CHANGES IN INCONTINENCE WERE ASSESSED WITH 7-DAY VOIDING DIARIES. RESULTS: THE MEAN (SD) AGE WAS 61.4 (8.2) YEARS, AND THE MEAN BASELINE FREQUENCY OF INCONTINENCE WAS 2.5 (1.3) EPISODES/D. AFTER 6 WEEKS, THE TOTAL INCONTINENCE FREQUENCY DECREASED BY 70% (1.8 [0.9] FEWER EPISODES/D) IN THE YOGA THERAPY VERSUS 13% (0.3 [1.7] FEWER EPISODES/D) IN THE CONTROL GROUP (P = 0.049). PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA THERAPY GROUP ALSO REPORTED AN AVERAGE OF 71% DECREASE IN STRESS INCONTINENCE FREQUENCY (0.7 [0.8] FEWER EPISODES/D) COMPARED WITH A 25% INCREASE IN CONTROLS (0.2 [1.1] MORE EPISODES/D) (P = 0.039). NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN REDUCTION IN URGENCY INCONTINENCE WERE DETECTED BETWEEN THE YOGA THERAPY VERSUS CONTROL GROUPS (1.0 [1.0] VERSUS 0.5 [0.5] FEWER EPISODES/D; P = 0.20). ALL WOMEN STARTING THE YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM COMPLETED AT LEAST 90% OF THE GROUP CLASSES AND PRACTICE SESSIONS. TWO PARTICIPANTS IN EACH GROUP REPORTED ADVERSE EVENTS UNRELATED TO THE INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS PROVIDE PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE FEASIBILITY, EFFICACY, AND SAFETY OF A GROUP-BASED YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE URINARY INCONTINENCE IN WOMEN.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
20 2591  24 YOGA FOR MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS-A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVES: TO SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEW AND META-ANALYZE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS. METHODS: MEDLINE (VIA PUBMED), THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS, AND SCOPUS WERE SCREENED THROUGH TO FEBRUARY 21, 2017 FOR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) COMPARING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS TO THOSE OF NO TREATMENT OR ACTIVE COMPARATORS. STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCES (SMD) AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CI) WERE CALCULATED. TWO AUTHORS INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSED RISK OF BIAS USING THE COCHRANE RISK OF BIAS TOOL. RESULTS: THIRTEEN RCTS WITH 1306 PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED. COMPARED WITH NO TREATMENT, YOGA REDUCED TOTAL MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS (SMD=-1.05; 95% CI -1.57 TO -0.53), PSYCHOLOGICAL (SMD=-0.75; 95% CI -1.17 TO -0.34), SOMATIC (SMD=-0.65; 95% CI -1.05 TO -0.25), VASOMOTOR (SMD=-0.76; 95% CI -1.27 TO -0.25), AND UROGENITAL SYMPTOMS (SMD=-0.53; 95% CI -0.81 TO -0.25). COMPARED WITH EXERCISE CONTROLS, ONLY AN EFFECT ON VASOMOTOR SYMPTOMS WAS FOUND (SMD=-0.45; 95% CI -0.87 TO -0.04). EFFECTS WERE ROBUST AGAINST SELECTION BIAS, BUT NOT AGAINST DETECTION AND ATTRITION BIAS. NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSION: YOGA SEEMS TO BE EFFECTIVE AND SAFE FOR REDUCING MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS. EFFECTS ARE COMPARABLE TO THOSE OF OTHER EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS.	2018

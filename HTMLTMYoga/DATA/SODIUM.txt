1 1944 138 SALT AND WATER BALANCE AFTER SWEAT LOSS: A STUDY OF BIKRAM YOGA. BIKRAM YOGA IS PRACTICED IN A ROOM HEATED TO 105 DEGREES F WITH 40% HUMIDITY FOR 90 MIN. DURING THE CLASS A LARGE VOLUME OF WATER AND ELECTROLYTES ARE LOST IN THE SWEAT, SPECIFICALLY, SODIUM IS LOST, THE MAIN CATION OF THE EXTRACELLULAR FLUID. THERE IS LITTLE KNOWN ABOUT THE VOLUME OF SWEAT AND THE AMOUNT OF SODIUM LOST IN SWEAT DURING BIKRAM YOGA OR THE OPTIMUM QUANTITY OF FLUID REQUIRED TO REPLACE THESE LOSSES. THE PARTICIPANTS WHO TOOK PART IN THIS SMALL FEASIBILITY STUDY WERE FIVE FEMALES WITH A MEAN AGE OF 47.4 +/- 4.7 YEARS AND 2.6 +/- 1.6 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AT BIKRAM YOGA. THE TOTAL BODY WEIGHT, WATER CONSUMED, SERUM SODIUM CONCENTRATION, SERUM OSMOLALITY, AND SERUM ALDOSTERONE LEVELS WERE ALL MEASURED BEFORE AND AFTER A BIKRAM YOGA PRACTICE. SWEAT SODIUM CHLORIDE CONCENTRATION AND OSMOLALITY WERE MEASURED AT THE END OF THE PRACTICE. THE MEAN ESTIMATED SWEAT LOSS WAS 1.54 +/- 0.65 L, WHILE THE AMOUNT OF WATER CONSUMED DURING BIKRAM YOGA WAS 0.38 +/- 0.22 L. EVEN THOUGH ONLY 25% OF THE SWEAT LOSS WAS REPLENISHED WITH WATER INTAKE DURING THE BIKRAM YOGA CLASS, WE DID NOT OBSERVE A CHANGE IN SERUM SODIUM LEVELS OR SERUM OSMOLALITY. THE SWEAT CONTAINED 82 +/- 16 MMOL/L OF SODIUM CHLORIDE FOR AN ESTIMATED TOTAL OF 6.8 +/- 2.1 G OF SODIUM CHLORIDE LOST IN THE SWEAT. THE SERUM ALDOSTERONE INCREASED 3.5-FOLD FROM BEFORE TO AFTER BIKRAM YOGA. THERE WAS A DECREASE IN THE EXTRACELLULAR BODY FLUID COMPARTMENT OF 9.7%. SWEAT LOSS IN BIKRAM YOGA PREDOMINATELY PRODUCED A VOLUME DEPLETION RATHER THAN THE DEHYDRATION OF BODY FLUIDS. THE SWEATING-STIMULATED RISE IN SERUM ALDOSTERONE LEVELS WILL LEAD TO INCREASED SODIUM REABSORPTION FROM THE KIDNEY TUBULES AND RESTORE THE EXTRACELLULAR FLUID VOLUME OVER THE NEXT 24 HR.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
2 1119  35 EFFICACY OF BOLUS LUKEWARM SALINE AND YOGA POSTURES AS COLONOSCOPY PREPARATION: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: COLONOSCOPY IS NOW THE GOLD STANDARD FOR COLON CANCER SCREENING AND A VITAL DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC TOOL IN 21ST CENTURY MEDICAL PRACTICE. ALTHOUGH ADVANCES HAVE BEEN SWIFT SINCE COLONOSCOPY CAME INTO WIDE USE A GENERATION AGO, ITS EFFECTIVENESS CAN BE COMPROMISED BY PATIENTS' ABILITY TO ADEQUATELY PREPARE FOR THE PROCEDURE. MANY PATIENTS DREAD THIS TASK MORE THAN THE PROCEDURE ITSELF. WHILE NO PREP REGIMEN CAN BE IDEAL FOR ALL PATIENTS, THE AUTHORS PRESENT A NOVEL APPROACH THAT REPRESENTS A POTENTIAL TIME-SAVING IMPROVEMENT FOR YOUNGER, HEALTHIER PATIENTS. IT IS A MODERN VERSION OF AN INDIAN PRACTICE CALLED SHANKH PRAKSHALANA, IN WHICH LUKEWARM SALINE IS USED IN COMBINATION WITH FIVE YOGA POSTURES TO CLEANSE THE BOWEL. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE SAFETY, EFFICACY, AND TOLERABILITY OF LUKEWARM SALINE AND YOGA (LWS/YOGA) AS A COLONOSCOPY PREPARATION IN COMPARISON WITH NULYTELY((R)) (PEG-3350, SODIUM CHLORIDE, SODIUM BICARBONATE, AND POTASSIUM CHLORIDE SOLUTION) USED ACCORDING TO THE MANUFACTURER'S INSTRUCTIONS. RESEARCH DESIGN: THIS WAS A PILOT STUDY COMPRISING 54 HEALTHY ADULTS, AGES 18-65, EQUALLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: GROUP A PREPARING WITH LUKEWARM SALINE AND YOGA POSTURES (LWS/YOGA); AND GROUP B PREPARING WITH NULYTELY((R)) AS DIRECTED ON THE LABEL. MEASUREMENTS: DATA WERE COLLECTED ON THE QUALITY OF BOWEL PREPARATION, PATIENT SAFETY, PATIENT TOLERABILITY, AND SIDE-EFFECTS. THE SETTING WAS A JOINT COMMISSION ACCREDITED OUTPATIENT ENDOSCOPY CLINIC. INTERVENTIONS: PATIENTS PERFORMED THE SERIES OF FIVE YOGA POSTURES KNOWN AS SHANKH PRAKSHALANA, INTERRUPTING THE EXERCISES AT REGULAR INTERVALS TO CONSUME 480 ML OF LUKEWARM SALINE. THE SOLUTION WAS PREPARED BY ADDING 9 G OF SODIUM CHLORIDE PER LITER OF LUKEWARM WATER (99 DEGREES F-102 DEGREES F/37.2 DEGREES C-38.9 DEGREES C). RESULTS: THE MEAN TOTAL SCORE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER IN GROUP A VERSUS GROUP B (20.63 +/- 5.09 VERSUS 16.48 +/- 5.18, P < 0.0007). IN GROUP A, 24/27 (88.9%) OF PATIENTS HAD EXCELLENT OR OPTIMUM TOTAL SCORES, COMPARED WITH 21/27 (77.8%) IN GROUP B (NOT SIGNIFICANT). IN OUR PILOT STUDY, LWS/YOGA, USED UNDER SUPERVISION, PRODUCED BETTER COLON PREPARATION THAN NULYTELY, USED AS DIRECTED. LIMITATIONS: A RANDOMIZED, ENDOSCOPIST-BLINDED STUDY IS NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE RESULTS. CONCLUSIONS: SHANKH PRAKSHALANA IS EFFECTIVE AS A COLONOSCOPY PREPARATION.	2010	

3  722  24 EFFECT OF KARAMARDADI YOGA VERSUS DICLOFENAC SODIUM IN POST-OPERATIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT: A RANDOMIZED COMPARATIVE CLINICAL TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: POST-OPERATIVE PAIN IS NOCICEPTIVE I.E., ANTICIPATED UNAVOIDABLE PHYSIOLOGICAL PAIN WHICH IS CAUSED DUE TO TISSUE TRAUMA. DRUGS SUCH AS NSAIDS (NON STEROIDAL ANTI INFLAMMATORY DRUGS) AND OPIOIDS ARE USED FOR POST-OPERATIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT BUT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR OWN DRAWBACKS. KARAMARDADI YOGA HAS BEEN IN USE IN AYURVEDIC PRACTICE FOR ANALGESIA. IT IS KNOWN TO RELIEVE PAIN AND CAN BE USED TO SUPPLEMENT ANAESTHESIA AND ALSO GET RID OF ADVERSE EFFECT OF MODERN ANALGESIC DRUGS. AIMS AND OBJECTIVE: TO STUDY THE COMPARATIVE EFFECT OF KARAMARDADI YOGA AND DICLOFENAC SODIUM IN POST-OPERATIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL WITH GROUP A (CONTROL GROUP: TAB DICLOFENAC SODIUM 50 MG AS A SINGLE DOSE) AND GROUP B (TRIAL GROUP: CAP KARAMARDADI YOGA 500 MG AS A SINGLE DOSE). THOSE WHO HAD UNDERGONE HAEMORRHOIDECTOMY OPERATION UNDER LOCAL ANAESTHESIA WERE SELECTED AS PER INCLUSION CRITERIA. VITALS, DESIRABLE EFFECT AND UNDESIRABLE EFFECT, TOTAL SURGICAL TIME, REQUIREMENT OF 1(ST) DOSE OF ANALGESIC, REQUIREMENT OF RESCUE ANALGESIC AND PAIN DETERMINED BY VAS (VISUAL ANALOG SCALE) WERE THE ASSESSMENT CRITERIA AND WERE OBSERVED AND RECORDED. RESULTS: KARAMARDADI YOGA DOES NOT SHOW ANY UNDESIRABLE OR SERIOUS ILL EFFECTS AND ALTERED VALUES OF VITALS AS PER STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. AS PER VAS SCALE, PAIN FELT BY TRIAL GROUP WAS EARLIER THAN CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: KARAMARDADI YOGA HAS ANALGESIC PROPERTY BUT ITS ANALGESIC PROPERTY AND PAIN THRESHOLD CAPACITY IS LESSER THAN THOSE OF DICLOFENAC SODIUM.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
4 1915  24 ROLE OF NATUROPATHY AND YOGA TREATMENT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION. AIM: THE PRIMARY AIM WAS TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF NATUROPATHY AND YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN TREATMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE HYPERTENSION. DESIGN: THE VARIABLES OF INTEREST WERE MEASURED AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE INTERVENTION USING A PRE-POST DESIGN. SETTING: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED BY INYS MEDICAL RESEARCH SOCIETY IN JINDAL NATURE CURE INSTITUTE, BANGALORE. SUBJECTS: A TOTAL OF 104 SUBJECTS, ALREADY DIAGNOSED WITH MILD TO MODERATE HYPERTENSION AND ON TREATMENT WITH ANTIHYPERTENSIVE MEDICINES WERE INCLUDED IN STUDY. INTERVENTIONS: THE INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF VARIOUS INPATIENT ADMINISTRATION OF DIFFERENT NATUROPATHY TREATMENTS, YOGA THERAPIES, LOW CALORIE AND LOW SODIUM DIET FOR 21 DAYS. ANTIHYPERTENSIVE MEDICINES WERE WITHDRAWN FOR SOME PATIENTS IN ONE WEEK BASED UPON RESPONSE TO THE TREATMENT. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE OUTCOME MEASURES WERE VALUES OF DIASTOLIC AND SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND BODY WEIGHT. SUBJECTS WERE FOLLOWED FOR A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR AFTER EVERY 3 MONTHS. RESULTS: AFTER STARTING NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACH OF NATUROPATHY AND YOGA, SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE CAME DOWN FROM MEAN OF 139.6 TO 129.6 WHERE AS IT CAME DOWN FROM 91.2 TO 86.1 FOR DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE. AT THE SAME TIME FAVORABLE EFFECT WAS ALSO SEEN IN OTHER VARIABLES LIKE LIPID PROFILE AND BODY WEIGHT. AT THE END OF ONE YEAR OUT OF 57 PATIENTS WHO CAME FOR FOLLOW-UP, 14 CASES WERE FOUND TO HAVE BLOOD PRESSURE WITHIN NORMAL RANGES WITHOUT ANY MEDICATION OVER THE PREVIOUS 12 MONTHS. CONCLUSION: NATUROPATHY AND YOGA THERAPY CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A VALUABLE NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACH IN TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
5 1552  24 LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION IN BLOOD PRESSURE STUDY II (LIMBS): STUDY PROTOCOL OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL ASSESSING THE EFFICACY OF A 24 WEEK STRUCTURED YOGA PROGRAM VERSUS LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION ON BLOOD PRESSURE REDUCTION. HYPERTENSION IS A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE AFFECTING 68 MILLION ADULTS IN THE UNITED STATES. LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS INCLUDING COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES SUCH AS THE MOVEMENT BASED MIND BODY PRACTICE OF YOGA HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY POPULAR IN THE UNITED STATES AND HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED AS A POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE TO MEDICATION IN BLOOD PRESSURE REDUCTION. WE COMPLETED A PILOT STUDY IN 2009 WHICH SHOWED MEANINGFUL DECREASES IN 24-HOUR AMBULATORY BLOOD PRESSURE READINGS AFTER A 12 WEEK PERIOD OF YOGA PARTICIPATION. BASED ON DATA FROM OUR PILOT STUDY WE ARE NOW COMPLETING THE LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AND BLOOD PRESSURE STUDY (LIMBS II) WHICH IS A PHASE 2 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL DESIGNED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY AND ENHANCED LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION ON LOWERING BLOOD PRESSURE IN PRE-HYPERTENSIVE AND STAGE 1 HYPERTENSIVE SUBJECTS. USING 24-HOUR AMBULATORY BLOOD PRESSURE MONITORING, LIMBS II AIMS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS ON BLOOD PRESSURE REDUCTION IN SUBJECTS RANDOMIZED FOR 24 WEEKS TO ONE OF THE THREE FOLLOWING GROUPS: YOGA THERAPY VERSUS BLOOD PRESSURE EDUCATION PROGRAM (SODIUM RESTRICTION AND WALKING PROGRAM) VERSUS A COMBINATION PROGRAM THAT INVOLVES COMPONENTS OF BOTH GROUPS. LIMBS II WILL ALSO EXAMINE THE IMPACT THAT CHANGES IN BLOOD PRESSURE HAVE ON CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW. IF SUCCESSFUL, THE LIMBS STUDY WILL DETERMINE IF YOGA THERAPY COMBINED WITH ENHANCED LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION WILL RESULT IN CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL DECREASES IN BLOOD PRESSURE AND THUS CAN BE IMPLEMENTED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO DRUG THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH PREHYPERTENSION AND STAGE 1 HYPERTENSION.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
6 2350  21 USING YOGA NIDRA RECORDINGS FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING COLONOSCOPY. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS PRODUCED BY YOGA NIDRA AND RELAXATION MUSIC FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING COLONOSCOPY. A QUASIEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN WAS USED. METHODS: IN TOTAL, 144 PATIENTS WHO WERE SCHEDULED TO UNDERGO COLONOSCOPY WERE ASSIGNED TO THREE DIFFERENT TREATMENT GROUPS. GROUP 1 WAS A NO TREATMENT CONTROL GROUP, GROUP 2 WAS DELIVERED RELAXING MUSIC, AND GROUP 3 WAS DELIVERED A YOGA NIDRA RECORDING. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS PAIN SCORE. SECONDARY TREATMENT EFFICACY MEASURES WERE AN OVERALL PATIENT SATISFACTION SCORE, A WILLINGNESS TO REPEAT THE PROCEDURE SCORE, AND A PERCEIVED COLONOSCOPE INSERTION DIFFICULTY SCORE. SECONDARY OBJECTIVE TREATMENT EFFECT MEASURES WERE SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND TOTAL PROCEDURE DURATION. RESULTS: THE PATIENTS' PERCEPTIONS OF PAIN AND THE ENDOSCOPIST'S PERCEIVED COLONOSCOPE INSERTION DIFFICULTY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BY BOTH THE MUSIC AND THE YOGA NIDRA RECORDING (P < .05). OVERALL PATIENT SATISFACTION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED BY BOTH THE MUSIC AND THE YOGA NIDRA RECORDING (P < .05). PATIENTS' WILLINGNESS TO REPEAT THE PROCEDURE AND THE TOTAL PROCEDURE DURATION WERE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED AND REDUCED, RESPECTIVELY, BY THE YOGA NIDRA RECORDING (P < .05), BUT THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES COMPARED TO THE MUSIC GROUP. THERE WERE NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AMONG THE THREE GROUPS IN TERMS OF BLOOD PRESSURE. CONCLUSIONS: BOTH THE YOGA NIDRA RECORDING AND THE RELAXATION MUSIC HELPED REDUCE THE PAIN PARTICIPANTS UNDERGOING COLONOSCOPY EXPERIENCED. THE YOGA NIDRA RECORDING WAS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL INTERVENTION AMONG THE THREE GROUPS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
7 1929  26 ROLE OF YOGA IN MANAGEMENT OF ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION. TWENTY FIVE PATIENTS OF ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION WERE STUDIED. OF THESE, 20 PATIENTS WERE NOT GIVEN ANY ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUG TREATMENT (GROUP A); OTHER 5 HAD TO BE PUT ON ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS BEFORE INCLUDING THEM IN THE STUDY (GROUP B). THESE PATIENTS WERE DEMONSTRATED "SHAVASANA" AND TRAINED TO PERFORM IT CORRECTLY. SHAVASANA THERAPY WAS CONTINUED FOR SIX MONTHS. THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT FALL IN BOTH MEAN SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC PRESSURE OF BOTH GROUPS. FURTHER, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DOSES OF ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS, BEING GIVEN TO PATIENTS OF GROUP B. IN 65% PATIENTS OF GROUP A, BLOOD PRESSURE COULD BE CONTROLLED WITH SHAVASANA ONLY AND NO DRUG WAS NEEDED IN THEM AT ALL. BLOOD PRESSURE ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY TO PRE-SHAVASANA LEVELS IN PATIENTS WHO LEFT PRACTISING YOGA. THUS, WITH USE OF YOGA (SHAVASANA) IN THERAPY OF HYPERTENSION, REQUIREMENT OF ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED AND IN SOME CASES MAY BE TOTALLY DISPENSED WITH AND IT MAY BE AN USEFUL ADJUNCT IN TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION.	1984	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
8  867  34 EFFECT OF YOGA REGIMEN ON LUNG FUNCTIONS INCLUDING DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE PATIENTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. BACKGROUND: LUNG FUNCTIONS ARE FOUND TO BE IMPAIRED IN CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD), CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE, LEFT VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION, AND AFTER CARDIAC SURGERY. DIFFUSION CAPACITY PROGRESSIVELY WORSENS AS THE SEVERITY OF CAD INCREASES DUE TO REDUCTION IN LUNG TISSUE PARTICIPATING IN GAS EXCHANGE. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISES AND YOGIC POSTURES MAY PLAY AN IMPRESSIVE ROLE IN IMPROVING CARDIO-RESPIRATORY EFFICIENCY AND FACILITATING GAS DIFFUSION AT THE ALVEOLO-CAPILLARY MEMBRANE. THIS STUDY WAS DONE TO SEE THE EFFECT OF YOGA REGIMEN ON LUNG FUNCTIONS PARTICULARLY DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN CAD PATIENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 80 STABLE CAD PATIENTS BELOW 65 YEARS OF AGE OF BOTH SEXES WERE SELECTED AND RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS OF 40 EACH. GROUP I CAD PATIENTS WERE GIVEN YOGA REGIMEN FOR 3 MONTHS WHICH CONSISTED OF YOGIC POSTURES, PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISES, DIETARY MODIFICATION, AND HOLISTIC TEACHING ALONG WITH THEIR CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE WHILE GROUP II CAD PATIENTS WERE PUT ONLY ON CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE. LUNG FUNCTIONS INCLUDING DIFFUSION CAPACITY WERE RECORDED THRICE IN BOTH THE GROUPS: 0 DAY AS BASELINE, 22(ND) DAY AND ON 90(TH) DAY BY USING COMPUTERIZED MS MEDISOFT CARDIO-RESPIRATORY INSTRUMENT, HYP'AIR COMPACT MODEL OF CARDIO-RESPIRATORY TESTING MACHINE WAS MANUFACTURED BY P K MORGAN, INDIA. THE RECORDED PARAMETERS WERE STATISTICALLY ANALYZED BY REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA FOLLOWED BY TUKEY'S TEST IN BOTH THE GROUPS. CARDIOVASCULAR PARAMETERS WERE ALSO COMPARED BEFORE AND AFTER INTERVENTION IN BOTH THE GROUPS. RESULTS: STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE SEEN IN SLOW VITAL CAPACITY, FORCED VITAL CAPACITY, PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE, MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION, AND DIFFUSION FACTOR/ TRANSFER FACTOR OF LUNG FOR CARBON MONOXIDE AFTER 3 MONTHS OF YOGA REGIMEN IN GROUP I. FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1(ST) SEC (FEV1), AND FEV1 % ALSO SHOWED A TREND TOWARD IMPROVEMENT ALTHOUGH NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. HR, SBP AND DBP ALSO SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN GROUP-I PATIENTS WHO FOLLOWED YOGA REGIMEN. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA REGIMEN WAS FOUND TO IMPROVE LUNG FUNCTIONS AND DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN CAD PATIENTS BESIDES IMPROVING CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTIONS. THUS, IT CAN BE USED AS A COMPLIMENTARY OR ADJUNCT THERAPY ALONG WITH THE CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE FOR THEIR TREATMENT AND REHABILITATION.	2015

CONCLUSION: YOGA, BEING A LIFESTYLE INCORPORATING EXERCISE AND STRESS MANAGEMENT TRAINING, TARGETS THE ELEVATED LIPID LEVELS IN PATIENTS WITH DIABETES THROUGH INTEGRATED APPROACHES.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
10 1644  25 MORBIDITY PROFILE OF PATIENTS SEEKING NATUROPATHY AND YOGA TREATMENT IN SOUTH INDIA: A DESCRIPTIVE STUDY. BACKGROUND YOGA AND NATUROPATHY (Y&N) IS ONE OF THE APPROVED COMPLEMENTARY AND TRADITIONAL SYSTEMS OF MEDICINE PRACTICED IN INDIA. UNLIKE OTHER SYSTEMS, IT IS A DRUGLESS SYSTEM AIMED TO OPTIMIZE AND FACILITATE THE INHERENT ABILITY OF THE HUMAN BODY TO HEAL ITSELF. THERE IS LACK OF LITERATURE ON THE TYPE OF PATIENTS SEEKING YOGA AND NATUROPATHY TREATMENTS IN INDIA. THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED WITH AN OBJECTIVE TO ASSESS THE MORBIDITY PROFILE OF THE IN-PATIENTS TREATED IN A NATUROPATHY AND YOGA HOSPITAL. METHODS DESCRIPTIVE STUDY DESIGN BASED ON CLINICAL CASE RECORDS. SIX HUNDRED AND FOUR CASES TREATED AS IN-PATIENTS BETWEEN APRIL 2017 AND JULY 2018 WAS ANALYZED. RESULTS THE AVERAGE AGE OF THE PATIENTS WAS 47.4 (SD +/- 16.1) YEARS, WITH 56% WERE FEMALES AND 44% MALES. ABOUT 50 DIFFERENT TYPES OF MORBIDITY RANGING FROM GENERAL REJUVENATION TO CHRONIC DISEASES HAD BEEN REPORTED. HIGHEST REPORTED DISEASES WERE CHRONIC IN NATURE, WITH HIGHER REPORTING FOR MULTIPLE SYSTEM MORBIDITY, FOLLOWED BY OBESITY, DIABETES MELLITUS, HYPERTENSION, ARTHRITIS, AND BACK PAIN. VARIATIONS WERE OBSERVED IN THE MORBIDITIES BASED ON AGE AND GENDER OF THE PATIENTS. THE MEDIAN DURATION OF TREATMENT WAS 8DAYS. CONCLUSIONS PATIENTS SEEK YOGA & NATUROPATHY CARE MAINLY FOR CHRONIC CONDITIONS, FURTHER OBSERVATIONS ON TREATMENT OUTCOMES, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND TREATMENT SEEKING BEHAVIOR CAN BE EXPLORED FOR THE EFFICACY AND FEASIBILITY OF YOGA & NATUROPATHY CARE IN MANAGING CHRONIC DISEASES.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
11 1345  26 HYPERTENSION ANALYSIS OF STRESS REDUCTION USING MINDFULNESS MEDITATION AND YOGA (THE HARMONY STUDY): STUDY PROTOCOL OF A RANDOMISED CONTROL TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: HYPERTENSION (HTN) IS A LEADING RISK FACTOR FOR PREVENTABLE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, WITH OVER ONE IN FIVE ADULTS AFFECTED WORLDWIDE. LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION IS A KEY STRATEGY FOR THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF HTN. STRESS HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER CARDIOVASCULAR RISK, AND STRESS MANAGEMENT IS A RECOMMENDED INTERVENTION FOR HYPERTENSIVES. STRESS REDUCTION THROUGH RELAXATION THERAPIES HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE AN EFFECT ON HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY, INCLUDING LOWERING BLOOD PRESSURE (BP). HOWEVER, INDIVIDUALISED BEHAVIOURAL INTERVENTIONS ARE RESOURCE INTENSIVE, AND GROUP STRESS MANAGEMENT APPROACHES HAVE NOT BEEN VALIDATED FOR REDUCING HTN. THE HARMONY STUDY IS A PILOT RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL DESIGNED TO DETERMINE IF MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION (MBSR), A STANDARDISED GROUP THERAPY, IS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR LOWERING BP IN STAGE 1 UNMEDICATED HYPERTENSIVES. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: MEN AND WOMEN UNMEDICATED FOR HTN WITH MEAN DAYTIME AMBULATORY BLOOD PRESSURE (ABP) >/=135/85 MM HG OR 24 H ABP >/=130/80 MM HG ARE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. SUBJECTS ARE RANDOMISED TO RECEIVE MBSR IMMEDIATELY OR AFTER A WAIT-LIST CONTROL PERIOD. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE IS MEAN AWAKE AND 24 H ABP. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE HARMONY STUDY IS TO COMPARE ABP BETWEEN THE TREATMENT AND WAIT-LIST CONTROL ARM AT THE 12-WEEK PRIMARY ASSESSMENT PERIOD. RESULTS FROM THIS STUDY WILL DETERMINE IF MBSR IS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR LOWERING BP IN EARLY UNMEDICATED HYPERTENSIVES. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: THIS RESEARCH PROJECT WAS APPROVED BY THE SUNNYBROOK RESEARCH ETHICS BOARD AND THE UNIVERSITY HEALTH NETWORK RESEARCH ETHICS BOARD (TORONTO, CANADA). PLANNED ANALYSES ARE IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE DECLARATION OF HELSINKI. DATA COLLECTION WILL BE COMPLETED BY EARLY SPRING 2012. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY ANALYSIS WILL COMMENCE IMMEDIATELY AFTER DATA MONITORING IS COMPLETED; DISSEMINATION PLANS INCLUDE PREPARING PUBLICATIONS FOR SUBMISSION DURING THE SUMMER OF 2012.

12 1453  26 INFLUENCE OF PRANAYAMAS AND YOGA-ASANAS ON SERUM INSULIN, BLOOD GLUCOSE AND LIPID PROFILE IN TYPE 2 DIABETES. A DISTINGUISHABLE FEATURE OF TYPE 2 DIABETES BESIDES HYPERGLYCEMIA AND DERANGED LIPID PROFILE IS AN IMPAIRED INSULIN SECRETION, PERIPHERAL INSULIN RESISTANCE AND OBESITY WHICH HAS BECOME A MAJOR HEALTH CONCERN WORLDWIDE. INDIA WITH AN ESTIMATED 31MILLION DIABETICS IN 2000 AND 79MLLIONS BY THE YR 2030 HAS THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF TYPE 2 DIABETICS IN THE WORLD. IN THIS STUDY, WE AIMED TO SEE IF YOGA-ASANAS AND PRANAYAMAS HAVE ANY INFLUENCE IN MODIFYING CERTAIN BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS. SIXTY PATIENTS OF UNCOMPLICATED TYPE 2 DIABETES (AGE 35-60 YRS OF 1-10 YRS DURATION) WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: GROUP 1 (N=30): PERFORMED YOGA ALONG WITH THE CONVENTIONAL HYPOGLYCEMIC MEDICINES AND GROUP 2 (N=30): PATIENTS WHO ONLY RECEIVED CONVENTIONAL MEDICINES. DURATION OF THE STUDY WAS 45 DAYS. BASAL RECORDINGS OF BLOOD GLUCOSE (FASTING AND POST-PRANDIAL), LIPID PROFILE AND SERUM INSULIN WERE TAKEN AT THE TIME OF RECRUITMENT AND THE SECOND READING AFTER FORTY FIVE DAYS. RESULTS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ALL THE BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS IN GROUP 1 WHILE GROUP 2 SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ONLY FEW PARAMETERS, THUS SUGGESTING A BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF YOGA REGIMEN ON THESE PARAMETERS IN DIABETIC PATIENTS.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
13 1370  24 IMPACT OF A STRUCTURED YOGA PROGRAM ON BLOOD PRESSURE REDUCTION AMONG HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS: STUDY PROTOCOL FOR A PRAGMATIC RANDOMIZED MULTICENTER TRIAL IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE SETTINGS IN NEPAL. BACKGROUND: HYPERTENSION CONTROL REMAINS A MAJOR GLOBAL CHALLENGE. THE BEHAVIORAL APPROACHES RECOMMENDED FOR BLOOD PRESSURE REDUCTION ARE STRESS REDUCTION, INCREASED EXERCISE AND HEALTHY DIETARY HABITS. SOME STUDY FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA HAS A BENEFICIAL EFFECT IN REDUCING BLOOD PRESSURE. HOWEVER, THE ROLE OF YOGA ON BLOOD PRESSURE HAS RECEIVED LITTLE ATTENTION IN EXISTING HEALTH CARE PRACTICES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THIS STUDY WILL BE CONDUCTED IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE FACILITIES IN NEPAL TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A PRAGMATIC YOGA INTERVENTION TO COMPLEMENT STANDARD PRACTICE IN FURTHER REDUCING BLOOD PRESSURE. METHODS: THIS WILL BE MULTICENTRIC, TWO ARMS, RANDOMIZED, NONBLINDED, PRAGMATIC TRIAL. IT WILL BE CONDUCTED IN SEVEN DISTRICT AYURVEDA HEALTH CENTERS (DAHCS) IN NEPAL BETWEEN JULY 2017 AND JUNE 2018. THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS WILL CONSIST OF HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS WITH OR WITHOUT ANTIHYPERTENSIVE MEDICATION ATTENDING TO THE OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENT (OPD). ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY PARTICIPANTS WILL BE RANDOMIZED TO TREATMENT OR CONTROL GROUPS BY USING A STRATIFIED BLOCK RANDOMIZATION. AT THE STUDY SITE, THE TREATMENT ARM PARTICIPANTS WILL RECEIVE AN INTERVENTION CONSISTING OF FIVE DAYS OF STRUCTURED YOGA TRAINING AND PRACTICE OF THE SAME PACKAGE AT HOME WITH A RECOMMENDATION OF FIVE DAYS A WEEK FOR THE FOLLOWING 90 DAYS. BOTH THE INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS WILL RECEIVE TWO HOURS OF HEALTH EDUCATION ON LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME OF THIS TRIAL WILL BE THE CHANGE IN SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND IT WILL BE ASSESSED AFTER 90 DAYS OF THE INTERVENTION. DISCUSSION: THIS STUDY WILL ESTABLISH THE EXTENT TO WHICH A YOGA INTERVENTION PACKAGE CAN HELP REDUCE BLOOD PRESSURE IN HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS. IF PROVEN EFFECTIVE, STUDY FINDINGS MAY BE USED TO RECOMMEND THE GOVERNING BODIES AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS FOR THE INTEGRATION OF YOGA IN THE NATIONAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FOR THE TREATMENT AND CONTROL OF HYPERTENSION.

14 1758  25 POSITIVE ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFECTS OF GENERIC YOGA IN DEPRESSIVE OUT-PATIENTS: A COMPARATIVE STUDY. CONTEXT: THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS IN DEPRESSION OF YOGA ADOPTED FROM DIFFERENT SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED. THE EFFICACY OF A GENERIC MODULE OF YOGA ON DEPRESSED PATIENTS HAS NOT YET BEEN TESTED IN THE LITERATURE. AIMS: THE STUDY WAS AIMED TO COMPARE THE THERAPEUTIC EFFECT OF A GENERIC YOGA MODULE WITH ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUGS IN NON-SUICIDAL OUT-PATIENTS OF MAJOR DEPRESSION ATTENDING A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: THE STUDY WAS OUTPATIENT-BASED USING AN OPEN-LABELED DESIGN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 137 OUT-PATIENTS OF DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS RECEIVED ONE OF THE THREE TREATMENTS AS THEY CHOSE - YOGA-ONLY, DRUGS-ONLY OR BOTH. THE YOGA WAS TAUGHT BY A TRAINED YOGA PHYSICIAN FOR OVER A MONTH IN SPACED SESSIONS TOTALING AT LEAST 12. PATIENTS WERE ASSESSED BEFORE TREATMENT, AFTER 1 AND 3 MONTHS ON DEPRESSION AND CLINICAL GLOBAL IMPRESSION SCALES. OUT OF 137, 58 PATIENTS COMPLETED THE STUDY PERIOD WITH ALL ASSESSMENTS. RESULTS: PATIENTS IN THE THREE ARMS OF TREATMENT WERE COMPARABLE ON DEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL VARIABLES. PATIENTS IN ALL THREE ARMS OF TREATMENT OBTAINED A REDUCTION IN DEPRESSION SCORES AS WELL AS CLINICAL SEVERITY. HOWEVER, BOTH YOGA GROUPS (WITH OR WITHOUT DRUGS) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN THE DRUGS-ONLY GROUP. HIGHER PROPORTION OF PATIENTS REMITTED IN THE YOGA GROUPS COMPARED WITH THE DRUGS-ONLY GROUP. NO UNTOWARD EVENTS WERE SPONTANEOUSLY REPORTED IN THE YOGA-TREATED PATIENTS. CONCLUSION: WITHIN THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY, IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT THE FINDINGS SUPPORT A CASE FOR PRESCRIBING YOGA AS TAUGHT IN THE STUDY IN DEPRESSIVE NON-SUICIDAL OUT-PATIENTS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
15 2615  26 YOGA FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA: PATIENTS' PERSPECTIVE. CONTEXT: YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION IS EMERGING AS AN EFFECTIVE ADD-ON THERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. HOWEVER, MANY BARRIERS MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR PATIENTS TO AVAIL YOGA THERAPY PROGRAMS. ONE OF THEM IS MOTIVATION FOR YOGA THERAPY. WAYS TO ADDRESS THE BARRIERS ARE CRITICAL TO EMPLOY YOGA AS A TREATMENT IN THIS POPULATION. AIM: THIS STUDY AIMS AT EXPLORING PATIENTS' WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN ADD-ON YOGA THERAPY PROGRAMS ON OUT-PATIENT BASIS. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON 100 SCHIZOPHRENIA PATIENTS ATTENDING PSYCHIATRY OUT-PATIENT SERVICES OF A TERTIARY CARE HOSPITAL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 100 SCHIZOPHRENIA PATIENTS (MALE: FEMALE = 57:43; AGE: 35.8 +/- 9.2 YEARS) ATTENDING THE PSYCHIATRY OUT-PATIENT SERVICES OF A TERTIARY NEUROPSYCHIATRY HOSPITAL WERE ADMINISTERED A SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRE. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: CHI-SQUARE TEST WAS USED FOR TESTING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PROPORTIONS. P < 0.05 WAS TAKEN TO BE SIGNIFICANT. RESULTS: ABOUT 46% WERE AWARE THAT YOGA IS ALSO ONE OF THE COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES USEFUL IN SCHIZOPHRENIA. 32% HAD TRIED YOGA IN THE PAST FOR SOME REASONS, BUT ONLY 31% OF THEM WERE CONTINUING YOGA; COMMONEST REASONS FOR NOT CONTINUING BEING LACK OF MOTIVATION (31%) AND INABILITY TO SPARE TIME (27.6%). HOWEVER, THE MAJORITY (88.5%) OF THEM WERE WILLING TO TAKE UP ADD-ON YOGA THERAPY ON OUT-PATIENT BASIS ALONG WITH THEIR REGULAR MEDICAL FOLLOW-UP. CONCLUSIONS: IN SPITE OF THE LACK OF MOTIVATION TO PRACTICE YOGA, THE MAJORITY OF PATIENTS WERE WILLING TO PARTICIPATE IN ADD-ON YOGA THERAPY PROGRAMS IF GIVEN ON OUT-PATIENT BASIS ALONG WITH THEIR REGULAR CONVENTIONAL MEDICAL FOLLOW-UP.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
16   39  25 A BRIEF BUT COMPREHENSIVE LIFESTYLE EDUCATION PROGRAM BASED ON YOGA REDUCES RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND DIABETES MELLITUS. OBJECTIVES: THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY WAS TO STUDY THE SHORT-TERM IMPACT OF A BRIEF LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION BASED ON YOGA ON SOME OF THE BIOCHEMICAL INDICATORS OF RISK FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND DIABETES MELLITUS. DESIGN: THE VARIABLES OF INTEREST WERE MEASURED AT THE BEGINNING (DAY 1) AND END (DAY 10) OF THE INTERVENTION USING A PRE-POST DESIGN. SETTING: THE STUDY IS THE RESULT OF OPERATIONAL RESEARCH CARRIED OUT IN OUR INTEGRAL HEALTH CLINIC (IHC). THE IHC IS AN OUTPATIENT FACILITY WHICH CONDUCTS 8-DAY LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION PROGRAMS BASED ON YOGA FOR PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC DISEASE. A NEW COURSE BEGINS EVERY ALTERNATE WEEK OF THE YEAR. SUBJECTS: THE STUDY IS BASED ON DATA COLLECTED ON 98 SUBJECTS (67 MALE, 31 FEMALE), AGES 20-74 YEARS, WHO ATTENDED ONE OF OUR PROGRAMS. THE SUBJECTS WERE A HETEROGENEOUS GROUP OF PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION, CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE, DIABETES MELLITUS, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER ILLNESSES. INTERVENTION: THE INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF ASANAS (POSTURES), PRANAYAMA (BREATHING EXERCISES), RELAXATION TECHNIQUES, GROUP SUPPORT, INDIVIDUALIZED ADVICE, LECTURES AND FILMS ON THE PHILOSOPHY OF YOGA AND THE PLACE OF YOGA IN DAILY LIFE, MEDITATION, STRESS MANAGEMENT, NUTRITION, AND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE ILLNESS. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE OUTCOME MEASURES WERE FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE AND SERUM LIPOPROTEIN PROFILE. THESE VARIABLES WERE DETERMINED IN FASTING BLOOD SAMPLES, TAKEN ON THE FIRST AND LAST DAY OF THE COURSE. RESULTS: FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE, SERUM TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (LDL) CHOLESTEROL, VERY- LDL CHOLESTEROL, THE RATIO OF TOTAL CHOLESTEROL TO HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (HDL) CHOLESTEROL, AND TOTAL TRIGLYCERIDES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER, AND HDL CHOLESTEROL SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER, ON THE LAST DAY OF THE COURSE COMPARED TO THE FIRST DAY OF THE COURSE. THE CHANGES WERE MORE MARKED IN SUBJECTS WITH HYPERGLYCEMIA OR HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA. CONCLUSIONS: THE OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT A SHORT LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AND STRESS MANAGEMENT EDUCATION PROGRAM LEADS TO FAVORABLE METABOLIC EFFECTS WITHIN A PERIOD OF 9 DAYS.	2005	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
17  373  17 AYURVEDA AND YOGA IN CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES. AYURVEDA IS DERIVED FROM 2 SANSKRIT WORDS, NAMELY, "AYUS" AND "VEDA," MEANING LIFE AND KNOWLEDGE, RESPECTIVELY. IT LITERALLY MEANS SCIENCE OF LIFE. AYURVEDA, OF WHICH YOGA IS AN INTEGRAL PART, IS WIDELY PRACTICED IN INDIA AND IS GAINING ACCEPTANCE IN MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. IT IS A COMPREHENSIVE AND A HOLISTIC SYSTEM, THE FOCUS OF WHICH IS ON THE BODY, MIND, AND CONSCIOUSNESS. THE AYURVEDIC TREATMENT CONSISTS OF THE USE HERBAL PREPARATIONS, DIET, YOGA, MEDITATION, AND OTHER PRACTICES. BASED ON THE REVIEW OF AVAILABLE STUDIES, THE EVIDENCE IS NOT CONVINCING THAT ANY AYURVEDIC HERBAL TREATMENT IS EFFECTIVE IN THE TREATMENT OF HEART DISEASE OR HYPERTENSION. HOWEVER, THE USE OF CERTAIN SPICES AND HERBS SUCH AS GARLIC AND TURMERIC IN AN OVERALL HEALTHY DIET IS APPROPRIATE. MANY HERBS USED BY AYURVEDIC PRACTITIONERS SHOW PROMISE AND COULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR LARGER RANDOMIZED TRIALS. YOGA, AN INTEGRAL PART OF AYURVEDA, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE USEFUL TO PATIENTS WITH HEART DISEASE AND HYPERTENSION. YOGA REDUCES ANXIETY, PROMOTES WELL-BEING, AND IMPROVES QUALITY OF LIFE. ITS SAFETY PROFILE IS EXCELLENT. ITS USE AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPEUTIC REGIMEN UNDER MEDICAL SUPERVISION IS APPROPRIATE AND COULD BE WORTH CONSIDERING.	2005	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
18 1928  25 ROLE OF YOGA IN DIABETES. THE SCIENCE OF YOGA IS AN ANCIENT ONE. IT IS A RICH HERITAGE OF OUR CULTURE. SEVERAL OLDER BOOKS MAKE A MENTION OF THE USEFULNESS OF YOGA IN THE TREATMENT OF CERTAIN DISEASES AND PRESERVATION OF HEALTH IN NORMAL INDIVIDUALS. THE EFFECT OF YOGIC PRACTICES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES HAS NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED WELL. WE CARRIED OUT WELL DESIGNED STUDIES IN NORMAL INDIVIDUALS AND THOSE WITH DIABETES TO ASSESS THE ROLE OF YOGIC PRACTICES ON GLYCAEMIC CONTROL, INSULIN KINETICS, BODY COMPOSITION EXERCISE TOLERANCE AND VARIOUS CO-MORBIDITIES LIKE HYPERTENSION AND DYSLIPIDEMIA. THESE STUDIES WERE BOTH SHORT TERM AND LONG-TERM. THESE STUDIES HAVE CONFIRMED THE USEFUL ROLE OF YOGA IN THE CONTROL OF DIABETES MELLITUS. FASTING AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS CAME DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY. GOOD GLYCAEMIC STATUS CAN BE MAINTAINED FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME. THERE WAS A LOWERING OF DRUG REQUIREMENT AND THE INCIDENCE OF ACUTE COMPLICATIONS LIKE INFECTION AND KETOSIS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE INSULIN KINETICS AND THOSE OF COUNTER-REGULATORY HORMONES LIKE CORTISOL. THERE WAS A DECREASE IN FREE FATTY ACIDS. THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN LEAN BODY MASS AND DECREASE IN BODY FAT PERCENTAGE. THE NUMBER OF INSULIN RECEPTORS WAS ALSO INCREASED. THERE WAS AN IMPROVEMENT IN INSULIN SENSITIVITY AND DECLINE IN INSULIN RESISTANCE. ALL THESE SUGGEST THAT YOGIC PRACTICES HAVE A ROLE EVEN IN THE PREVENTION OF DIABETES. THERE IS A BENEFICIAL EFFECT ON THE CO-MORBID CONDITIONS LIKE HYPERTENSION AND DYSLIPIDEMIA.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
19  603  16 DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF INTEGRATED YOGA MODULE FOR OBESITY IN ADOLESCENTS. BACKGROUND: OBESITY IS A GROWING GLOBAL EPIDEMIC AND CAUSE OF NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES. YOGA IS ONE OF THE EFFECTIVE WAYS TO REDUCE STRESS WHICH IS ONE OF THE CAUSES OF OBESITY. NOWADAYS, CHILDREN IN ADOLESCENT AGE ARE MORE PRONE TO GET OBESE DUE TO LACK OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY MAKING THEM MORE SEDENTARY. AIM: TO IDENTIFY THE DESIGN AND VALIDATION OF INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY MODULE (IAYTM) FOR OBESITY IN ADOLESCENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FIRST PHASE - IAYTM FOR OBESITY WAS DESIGNED BASED ON THE LITERATURE REVIEW OF CLASSICAL TEXTS AND RECENTLY PUBLISHED RESEARCH ARTICLES. SECOND PHASE - DESIGNED IAYTM WAS VALIDATED BY 16 SUBJECT MATTER (YOGA) EXPERTS. CONTENT-VALIDITY RATIO (CVR) WAS ANALYZED USING LAWSHE'S FORMULA.

20 1212  22 EXPLORING KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDE AND PRACTICE REGARDING YOGA AMONG PATIENTS ATTENDING CARDIOLOGY AND NEUROLOGY CLINICS IN A TERTIARY CARE HOSPITAL IN NORTHERN INDIA. BACKGROUND THE USE OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE, PARTICULARLY YOGA IS INCREASING IN NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES (NCDS). WE ASSESSED THE OVERALL AWARENESS REGARDING YOGA AMONG PATIENTS AND THEIR OPINION ABOUT IT AS AN ADJUNCT THERAPY FOR NCDS. METHODS WE INCLUDED 384 PATIENTS ATTENDING THE CARDIOLOGY AND NEUROLOGY CLINICS AT A TERTIARY CARE CENTRE IN NORTHERN INDIA. A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS DEVELOPED TO ASSESS THE KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDE AND PRACTICE OF YOGA AS A THERAPY. RESULTS NINETY PER CENT OF PATIENTS WERE AWARE OF YOGA, MAINLY THROUGH PRINT AND ELECTRONIC MEDIA. OF THE SURVEYED PATIENTS, 22% PRACTISED YOGA. LACK OF TIME AND KNOWLEDGE WERE CITED AS THE MAIN REASONS FOR NON-PRACTICE AMONG THE NON-PRACTISING PATIENTS (88%), OF WHICH 82% BELIEVED THAT YOGA COULD BE PRACTISED ALONG WITH MODERN MEDICINE. IN ADDITION, 61% WERE READY TO ACCEPT TREATMENT IF OFFERED AT THE SURVEYED TERTIARY CARE CENTRE. CONCLUSIONS ADEQUATE KNOWLEDGE, AWARENESS AND ATTITUDE TOWARDS YOGA APPEARS TO BE PRESENT IN CONTRAST TO THE LOW PRACTICE AMONG THE PATIENT POPULATION SURVEYED. IF IMPLEMENTED IN AN INTEGRATED FASHION, THE PATIENTS WERE WILLING TO ACCEPT YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT THERAPY FOR THEIR CARDIAC AND NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS-AN ENCOURAGING SIGN GIVEN THE BURDEN OF NCDS IN INDIA.	2022

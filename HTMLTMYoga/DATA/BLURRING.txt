1   56 131 A COMPARATIVE STUDY ON THE EFFECTS OF VINTAGE NONPHARMACOLOGICAL TECHNIQUES IN REDUCING MYOPIA (BATES EYE EXERCISE THERAPY VS. TRATAKA YOGA KRIYA). BACKGROUND: HUMAN EYE CAPTURES LIGHT RAYS AS THEY COME AND FALL ON THE RETINA AND CONVERT THEM INTO AN IMAGE. HOWEVER, IN MYOPIA, LIGHT RAYS FALL IN FRONT OF RETINA, CAUSING BLURRING OF IMAGE. CORRECTION OF THIS IS GENERALLY DONE USING CORRECTING DEVICES SUCH AS CORRECTIVE GLASSES AND CONTACT LENSES. EXISTENCE OF SOME ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES IS ALSO NOTICED IN LITERATURE. AIM: TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF BATES EYE EXERCISES AND TRATAKA YOGA KRIYA ON MYOPIA. MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY: ETHICAL CLEARANCE WAS OBTAINED FROM THE INSTITUTION, AND INFORMED CONSENT WAS TAKEN FROM PARTICIPANTS. IN THIS RANDOMIZED COMPARATIVE STUDY, 24 PARTICIPANTS (48 EYES) WERE TAKEN BASED ON INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA AND WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: GROUP A AND GROUP B, WHERE BATES EYE EXERCISE THERAPY AND TRATAKA YOGA KRIYA WERE GIVEN, RESPECTIVELY, FOR 8 WEEKS. PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSESSED FOR THEIR REFRACTIVE ERRORS AND VISUAL ACUITY PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION. RESULTS: DATA WERE ANALYZED BY SPSS VERSION 20. RESULTS OBTAINED REVEALED THAT BOTH BATES EXERCISES AND TRATAKA YOGA KRIYA WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING REFRACTIVE ERRORS AND IN IMPROVING VISUAL ACUITY (P VALUE OF REFRACTIVE ERROR IN RIGHT EYE: 0.4250; LEFT EYE: 0.4596; P VALUE OF VISUAL ACUITY IN RIGHT EYE: 0.5691; LEFT EYE: 0.8952). CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY CONCLUDES THAT NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES SUCH AS EYE EXERCISES AND TRATAKA YOGA KRIYA ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT ON MYOPIA.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
2 1763  22 POSTERIOR VITREOUS DETACHMENT PRECIPITATED BY YOGA. YOGA HAS RECENTLY BEEN TOUTED AS A MEANS TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WELL-BEING. HOWEVER, NO FORM OF EXERCISE IS WITHOUT ITS RISKS. A 32-YEAR-OLD CHINESE FEMALE WITH MODERATE MYOPIA COMPLAINED OF RIGHT EYE SUDDEN ONSET OF FLOATERS AND MILD BLURRING OF VISION AFTER THE HEAD-DOWN POSTURE. THE VISUAL ACUITY WAS 6/12 IN THE RIGHT EYE AND 6/9 IN THE LEFT EYE. A RIGHT EYE FUNDUS EXAMINATION SHOWED POSTERIOR VITREOUS DETACHMENT, WITH A SMALL BLOOD CLOT LOCATED AT THE INFERIOR MARGIN OF THE OPTIC DISC. THE PATIENT WAS DIAGNOSED WITH RIGHT EYE VITREOUS HEMORRHAGE SECONDARY TO ACUTE POSTERIOR VITREOUS DETACHMENT AND WAS MANAGED CONSERVATIVELY. ACUTE CHANGES IN POSTURE, ESPECIALLY BETWEEN AN UPRIGHT AND A HEAD-DOWN POSITION, MAY CAUSE ACUTE POSTERIOR VITREOUS DETACHMENT. AS YOGA PRACTITIONERS MAY BE REQUIRED TO ASSUME THIS HEAD-DOWN POSITION, MYOPIC PATIENTS SHOULD BE WARNED OF THE POSSIBLE OCULAR COMPLICATIONS OF THIS EXERCISE.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
3   45  40 A CLINICAL STUDY TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF TRATAKA YOGA KRIYA AND EYE EXERCISES (NON-PHARMOCOLOGICAL METHODS) IN THE MANAGEMENT OF TIMIRA (AMMETROPIA AND PRESBYOPIA). TIMIRA IS A DISEASE THAT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO WIDE RANGE OF CLINICAL CONDITIONS STARTING FROM MILD BLURRING OF VISION AND HAVING POTENTIAL RISK OF PERMANENT VISION LOSS. ACCORDING TO THE INVOLVEMENT OF DHATUS (BODY ELEMENTS) THE CONDITION CAN BE GROUPED INTO TWO STAGES. THE INITIAL STAGE OR UTTANA, WHERE THE INVOLVEMENT OF DHATUS IS LIMITED TO RASA, RAKTA (BLOOD), AND MAMSA DHATU (MUSCLE TISSUE). WHEN THE DOSHAS ARE LOCALIZED IN THE FIRST AND SECOND PATALA REFRACTIVE ERROR DO HAPPEN AND IN PRESBYOPIA MORE EMPHASIS IS GIVEN TO MAMSA DHATU. IN THIS STUDY ONLY UTTANA STAGE OF TIMIRA WAS CONSIDERED. THE CLINICAL STUDY WAS DONE ON 66 PATIENTS OF TIMIRA IN TWO GROUPS OF FOUR SUB GROUPS EACH OF MYOPIA, HYPERMETROPIA, ASTIGMATISM, AND PRESBYOPIA. GROUP A WAS SUBJECTED TO EYE EXERCISES (BATES METHOD) AND GROUP B WAS SUBJECTED TO TRATAKA YOGA KRIYA. AFTER THE ENROLMENT OF PATIENTS FOR THIS STUDY, SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS WERE ASSESSED BOTH SUBJECTIVELY AND OBJECTIVELY BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER TREATMENT. THE STUDY INDICATES THAT SUBJECTIVELY THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT RESULTS IN BOTH THE GROUPS BUT OBJECTIVELY THERE IS NOT MUCH IMPROVEMENT.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
4  512  41 COMPARATIVE STUDY ON THE EFFECT OF SAPTAMRITA LAUHA AND YOGA THERAPY IN MYOPIA. BACKGROUND: MYOPIA IS VERY COMMON OPHTHALMIC DISEASE ESPECIALLY IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENCE. IN AYURVEDIC TEXTS, ONLY BY THE MAIN FEATURE IMPAIRMENT OF DISTANT VISION MYOPIA CAN BE CORRELATED WITH DRISHTIGATA ROGAS (2(ND) PATALGATA TIMIRA). AIM: TO COMPARE THE EFFECT OF SAPTAMRUTA LAUHA AND YOGA THERAPY IN MYOPIA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IN PRESENT STUDY, A TOTAL 60 PATIENTS WITH AGE GROUP BETWEEN 8 TO 30 YEARS WERE SELECTED RANDOMLY FROM THE OUT-PATIENT DEPARTMENT OF SWASTHAVRITTA AND SHALAKYATANTRA DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT AYURVEDA COLLEGE, TRIVANDRUM, AND WERE DIVIDED IN TWO GROUPS. IN GROUP A, SAPTAMRITA LAUHA 250 MG TWICE DAILY WITH UNEQUAL QUANTITY OF HONEY AND GHRITA WAS ADMINISTERED WHILE IN GROUP B, PATIENTS SUBJECTED TO YOGA THERAPY (JALA NETI, NADI SHODHANA, SHITALI PRANAYAMA AND POINT TRATAK) FOR 3 MONTHS DURATION WITH 1 MONTH FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: THE RESULT OBTAINED FROM THE STUDY REVEALS THAT THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE VISUAL ACUITY AND CLINICAL REFRACTION, BUT ASSOCIATED CHANGES WERE OBSERVED AS REDUCED IN GROUP B WHEN COMPARED TO GROUP A. HOWEVER, RELIEF FROM HEADACHE WAS FOUND TO BE EQUALLY EFFECTIVE IN BOTH THE GROUPS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
5 1813  19 PROGRESSION OF GLAUCOMA ASSOCIATED WITH THE SIRSASANA (HEADSTAND) YOGA POSTURE. THIS ARTICLE REPORTS A CASE OF PROGRESSIVE GLAUCOMATOUS OPTIC NEUROPATHY AND VISUAL FIELD LOSS THAT OCCURRED IN A PATIENT WHO PRACTICED THE SIRSASANA (HEADSTAND) YOGA POSTURE ON A DAILY BASIS FOR MANY YEARS. VISUAL FIELD ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED THROUGH STANDARD AUTOMATED PERIMETRY. INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE (IOP) WAS MEASURED THROUGH PNEUMOTONOMETRY IN THE SITTING POSITION AND IN THE HEAD-DOWN POSITION. STEREO-OPTIC DISC PHOTOGRAPHS WERE OBTAINED. IOP INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE HEAD-DOWN POSITION. OPTIC DISC EVALUATION REVEALED A NEW DISC HEMORRHAGE IN THE LEFT EYE. VISUAL FIELD ANALYSIS OVER A PERIOD OF 2 Y SHOWED PROGRESSION OF A SUPERIOR ARCUATE DEFECT IN THE LEFT EYE. TRANSIENT INCREASES IN IOP ASSOCIATED WITH THE YOGA HEADSTAND POSTURE MAY LEAD TO PROGRESSIVE GLAUCOMATOUS OPTIC NERVE DAMAGE AND VISUAL FIELD LOSS.	2006

IN THIS CASE REPORT, WE PRESENT A MAN IN HIS LATE 30S WHO WAS PRACTISING A SPECIFIC YOGA STANCE WHEN HE EXPERIENCED A FEMORAL SHAFT FRACTURE.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
8  379  12 BASILAR ARTERY OCCLUSION FOLLOWING YOGA EXERCISE: A CASE REPORT. BASILAR ARTERY OCCLUSION DEVELOPED IN A 34 YEAR OLD WOMAN 2 MONTHS AFTER ADOPTING UNUSUAL NECK POSTURES DURING YOGA PRACTICE. ON ANGIOGRAPHY, HER BASILAR ARTERY WAS FILLED WITH INTRALUMINAL CLOT WHILE THE VERTEBRAL ARTERIES WERE NORMAL. WE POSTULATE THAT A SEVERE REDUCTION IN BLOOD FLOW AND POSSIBLY AN INTIMAL TEAR TRIGGERED THROMBOSIS OF THE VERTEBRAL ARTERY AND THAT THE FINAL STROKE MECHANISM WAS ARTERY-TO-ARTERY EMBOLISM.	1993	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
9 2809  17 YOGA THERAPY: BUILDING A HOLDING ENVIRONMENT FOR SOMATIC AND PSYCHE CHANGE. DRAWING ON IDEAS FROM D.W. WINNICOTT AND THE WORK OF QUAKER THEOLOGIAN PARKER PALMER, THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE CONCEPT OF A HOLDING ENVIRONMENT, ITS REFINED UNDERSTANDING IN THE LITERATURE OVER THE YEARS, AND HOW IT CAN BE OPTIMALLY USED IN YOGA THERAPY. THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT EFFECTIVELY ESTABLISHING A HOLDING ENVIRONMENT CAN FACILITATE BOTH SOMATIC AND DEEP STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN A CLIENT, FACILITATING HEALING FROM PRIMAL WOUNDING AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL RECONNECTION TO THE TRUE SELF.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
10  486  24 CLINICAL HYPNOSIS AND PATANJALI YOGA SUTRAS. THE TRANCE STATES IN YOGA AND HYPNOSIS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH SIMILAR PHENOMENA LIKE RELAXATION, DISINCLINATION TO TALK, UNREALITY, MISREPRESENTATION, ALTERATIONS IN PERCEPTION, INCREASED CONCENTRATION, SUSPENSION OF NORMAL REALITY TESTING, AND THE TEMPORARY NATURE OF THE PHENOMENA. WHILE SOME RESEARCHERS CONSIDER YOGA TO BE A FORM OF HYPNOSIS, OTHERS NOTE THAT THERE ARE MANY SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE TRANCE IN YOGA AND THE HYPNOTIC TRANCE. THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO FIND SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE TRANCE STATES OF HYPNOSIS AND PATANJALI'S YOGA SUTRAS. THE TRANCE STATES WERE COMPARED WITH THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE PHENOMENA OF TRANCE, AND THE THERAPEUTIC TECHNIQUES AND BENEFITS OF BOTH. AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONCEPT OF TRANCE IN PATANJALI'S YOGA SUTRAS WAS GAINED THROUGH A THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF THE BOOK FOUR CHAPTERS ON FREEDOM BY SWAMI SATYANANDA SARASWATI. THIS LED TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONCEPT OF TRANCE IN THE YOGA SUTRAS. THE OBTAINED CONCEPTS WERE COMPARED TO THE CONCEPTS OF TRANCE IN HYPNOSIS (OBTAINED THROUGH THE LITERATURE ON HYPNOSIS) TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER OR NOT THERE EXIST SIMILARITIES. THE FINDINGS OF THE STUDY SHOW THAT THERE ARE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE TRANCE IN HYPNOSIS AND THE TRANCE IN PATANJALI'S YOGA SUTRAS IN THE INDUCTION AND DEEPENING OF THE TRANCE STATES IN HYPNOSIS AND THAT OF SAMADHI, THE PHENOMENA PRESENT IN HYPNOSIS AND THE KINDS OF SIDDHIS THAT ARE OBTAINED THROUGH SAMADHI, AND THE THERAPEUTIC TECHNIQUES AND THE THERAPEUTIC PROCESS IN PATANJALI'S YOGA SUTRA AND HYPNOSIS.	2013

12  407  20 BIOLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF PIEZOELECTRICITY IN RELATION TO ACUPUNCTURE, HATHA YOGA, OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE AND ACTION OF AIR IONS. PIEZOELECTRIC PROPERTIES OF BIOLOGICAL MACROMOLECULES SUCH AS PROTEINS, NUCLEIC ACIDS AND MUCOPOLYSACCHARIDES ARE REVIEWED IN THIS PAPER. IT IS INDICATED THAT THE STRUCTURAL ELEMENTS OF THE HUMAN BODY COMPOSED OF THESE PIEZOELECTRIC SUBSTANCES ARE CAPABLE OF TRANSDUCING A MECHANICAL ENERGY INTO AN ELECTRIC CURRENT. SUCH A TRANSDUCTION MAY BE BROUGHT ABOUT BY MOVEMENTS OF AN ACUPUNCTURE NEEDLE, OSTEOPATHIC MANIPULATIONS; HATHA YOGA POSTURES OR ACTION OF NEGATIVELY CHARGED AIR IRONS. IT IS POSTULATED THAT ELECTRIC CURRENT INDUCED BY STIMULATION OF THE SPECIFIC SITES ON THE SURFACE OF HUMAN BODY FLOWS TOWARDS THE INTERNAL ORGANS ALONG THE SEMICONDUCTIVE CHANNELS OF BIOLOGIC MACROMOLECULES. ELECTRIC CURRENT INDUCED EITHER BY THE PIEZOELECTRIC TRANSDUCTION OR DIRECTLY APPLIED FROM AN EXTERNAL SOURCE MAY IN TURN STIMULATE INDIVIDUAL CELLS IN THE TARGET ORGAN. INVOLVEMENT OF ELECTRICAL PHENOMENA IN REGULATORY MECHANISMS ON CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR LEVELS IS DISCUSSED.	1977	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
13 2873  22 YOGA-INDUCED MYOSITIS OSSIFICANS TRAUMATICA OF THE SCAPHOLUNATE LIGAMENT. BACKGROUND MYOSITIS OSSIFICANS TRAUMATICA (MOT) INVOLVES THE HETEROTOPIC DEVELOPMENT OF LAMELLAR BONE AFTER A TRAUMATIC INJURY. DESPITE BEING TERMED "MYOSITIS," MOT IS NOT LIMITED TO MUSCLE BUT RATHER CAN INVOLVE TENDONS, FAT, AND FASCIA. "TRAUMATICA" REFLECTS THAT LESIONS ARE USUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH A HISTORY OF SIGNIFICANT TRAUMA, THAT IS, FRACTURES OR SURGERY; HOWEVER, MANY REPORTS SUGGEST THEY CAN ALSO BE LINKED TO REPETITIVE LOW-ENERGY INSULTS. IN BOTH CASES, THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE SECONDARY TO TISSUE INJURY GENERATES A PROLIFERATIVE OSTEOBLASTIC CASCADE. CASE DESCRIPTION WE PRESENT A CASE OF PERSISTENT WRIST PAIN IN A 43-YEAR-OLD WOMAN ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA ACTIVITIES. HER RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES DEMONSTRATED PARTIAL SCAPHOLUNATE (SL) LIGAMENT TEAR AND AN ASSOCIATED MASS LESION. SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REVEALED MOT INVOLVING THE SL LIGAMENT. LITERATURE REVIEW MOT LESIONS IN THE UPPER EXTREMITY ARE USUALLY LOCALIZED AROUND THE ELBOW, AND CASES IN THE HAND ARE RELATIVELY RARE. THERE ARE NO PRIOR REPORTS OF OCCURRENCES WITHIN THE WRIST JOINT OR IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE SL LIGAMENT. HOWEVER, BIOMECHANICAL STUDIES HAVE QUANTIFIED SIGNIFICANT MECHANICAL STRAINS ACROSS THE SL INTERVAL DURING VARIOUS YOGA POSES. THIS PATTERN OF MICROTRAUMA IS CAPABLE OF GENERATING MOT. CLINICAL RELEVANCE UPPER EXTREMITY WEIGHT-BEARING POSITIONS ARE COMMON IN YOGA AND SUBJECT THE WRIST, ESPECIALLY THE SL INTERVAL, TO HIGH MECHANICAL STRAINS. THIS PATTERN OF MICROTRAUMA SHOULD LEAD THE CLINICIAN TO SUSPECT MOT WHEN ENCOUNTERING A MASS IN THE WRIST, BUT MALIGNANCY AND INFECTION MUST BE RULED OUT.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
14 2911  17 [PSEUDOARTHROSIS OF THE FIRST RIB IN A PATIENT WHO PRACTICES YOGA. A CASE REPORT]. INTRODUCTION: PSEUDOARTHROSIS OF THE FIRST RIB IS A RARE CONDITION THAT MAY OCCUR IN ATHLETES AS A RESULT OF REPETITIVE ACTIVITIES, MAINLY OVERHEAD. THE USUAL CLINICAL PRESENTATION IS PAIN IN THE NECK OR THE IPSILATERAL SHOULDER. CASE REPORT: THIS IS THE CASE OF A 19-YEAR-OLD FEMALE PATIENT WHO HAD SUDDEN PAIN OF THE BASE OF THE NECK WHILE DOING YOGA. PSEUDOARTHROSIS OF THE FIRST RIB WAS DIAGNOSED WITH X-RAYS AND CAT SCAN. TREATMENT CONSISTED OF A REHABILITATION AND PHYSICAL THERAPY PROGRAM THAT WAS SUCCESSFUL DESPITE THE PERSISTENCE OF THE PSEUDOARTHROSIS. DISCUSSION: CASES OF FIRST RIB FRACTURES HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN ATHLETES PRACTICING MULTIPLE ACTIVITIES; HOWEVER, PSEUDOARTHROSIS CASES ARE RARE SINCE MOST OF THEM PROGRESS TO BONE HEALING. THIS IS THE FIRST REPORTED CASE OF A FRACTURE OR PSEUDOARTHROSIS IN A PATIENT PRACTICING YOGA. AS IN MOST REPORTED CASES, CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT WAS SUCCESSFUL. CONCLUSION: FRACTURES AND PSEUDOARTHROSIS OF THE FIRST RIB ARE RARE IN ATHLETES AND SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF ATHLETES PRESENTING WITH SHOULDER AND NECK PAIN. CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT IS SUCCESSFUL IN MOST CASES.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
15 1501  17 INVERTED YOGA AND NEAR SYNCOPE: AN UNUSUAL DIAGNOSIS OF RIGHT VENTRICULAR MYXOMA. PRIMARY CARDIAC TUMORS ARE EXTREMELY RARE AND ARE DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE. ALTHOUGH USUALLY BENIGN IN NATURE, MYXOMAS REQUIRE SURGICAL RESECTION DUE TO THEIR INCREASED RISK OF EMBOLIC AND CARDIAC COMPLICATIONS, WITH THE TIMING OF RESECTION DEPENDENT ON THE PRESENTATION AND SIZE OF THE TUMOR. HOWEVER, IF DIAGNOSED EARLY, PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY BENIGN CARDIAC TUMORS HAVE EXCELLENT PROGNOSIS FOLLOWING SURGERY. THEREFORE, A HIGH INDEX OF SUSPICION AND A WIDE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN DETECTING RARE CONDITIONS THAT CAN AFFECT OTHERWISE HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS. WE PRESENT AN UNCOMMON CASE OF A RIGHT VENTRICULAR MYXOMA THAT WAS DISCOVERED WHEN THE PATIENT WAS PERFORMING INVERTED YOGA AND EXPERIENCED A NEAR SYNCOPAL EPISODE. PATIENT SUBSEQUENTLY UNDERWENT AN ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION AND WAS FOUND TO HAVE A RIGHT VENTRICULAR MYXOMA THAT WAS EXCISED. ALTHOUGH RECURRENCE IS RARE, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR PHYSICIANS TO REMAIN VIGILANT AND CONTINUE CAREFUL AND CONSISTENT FOLLOW-UP FOR PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF A CARDIAC MYXOMA.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
16 1416  14 IMPORTANCE OF MANAS TATTVA: A SEARCHLIGHT IN YOGA DARSHANA. SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL 'MANAS' HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF CURIOSITY FOR SCHOLARS, SCIENTISTS AND PHILOSOPHERS. THE REASON BEHIND THIS CURIOSITY IS ITS IMPORTANCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MANKIND. HUMAN BEING IS SUPERIOR TO OTHER CREATURES IN THE SERIES OF DEVELOPMENT. THIS SUPREMACY OF MAN REMAINS IN HIS QUALITY TO WORK AFTER THINKING, WHICH IS THE FUNCTION OF 'MANAS'. NO OTHER ANIMAL IS CAPABLE TO THINK LOGICALLY. THIS IS THE ONLY REASON WHICH LEADS THE MANKIND TO THE CREST OF DEVELOPMENT IN EVERY ASPECT. TO HIGHLIGHT THE CONCEPT OF MANAS IN YOGA DARSHANA, INFORMATION EXTRACTED FROM YOGA LITERATURES AND AYURVEDIC SAMHITAS. IN INDIAN CULTURE MIND HAS BEEN DESCRIBED FROM VARIOUS ANGLES. VEDIC, PHILOSOPHICAL AND AYURVEDIC LITERATURES HAVE A VAST AND EXCLUSIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANAS. PHILOSOPHERS EITHER ASTIKA OR NASTIKA HAVE DESCRIBED MANAS SIDDHANTA VIVIDLY. THOUGH MANY KINDS OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINIONS ARE THERE, YOGA DARSHANA ACCEPT THE IMPORTANCE OF MIND IN THE PROCESS OF PERCEPTION AND EVEN FOR THE BIRTH OF ANY INDIVIDUAL.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
17   43  18 A CASE REPORT OF PATIENT PRACTISING YOGA LEADING TO DENTAL EROSION. THE ARTICLE PRESENTS THE CASE OF A PATIENT WHO WAS PRACTISING YOGA (KUNJAL KRIYA) WHICH LED TO DENTAL EROSION. DENTAL EROSION CAN BE DUE TO EXTRINSIC OR INTRINSIC CAUSES. THE INTRINSIC CAUSES INCLUDE VOMITING DUE TO ANOREXIA NERVOSA, REGURGITATION DUE TO ABNORMALITY IN GASTRO-INTESTINAL TRACT OR RUMINATION. A 38-YEAR-OLD MALE PATIENT PRESENTED WITH A RARE AETIOLOGY OF DENTAL EROSION. HE HAD PRACTICED KUNJAL KRIYA ONE OF THE YOGIC EXERCISES DESCRIBED IN ANCIENT INDIA. IN KUNJAL KRIYA THE PATIENT VOMITS ON AN EMPTY STOMACH IN ORDER TO CLEAN HIS OR HER GASTRO-INTESTINAL TRACT. THE PATIENT HAD PRACTICED THIS FORM OF EXERCISE FOR OVER 12 YEARS WHICH HAD LED TO SEVERE DENTAL EROSION. A PROPER CASE HISTORY SHOULD BE EVALUATED FOR EVERY PATIENT SO THAT THEY CAN BE COUNSELLED FOR ANY FACTORS THAT COULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO DENTAL HEALTH. EARLY DIAGNOSIS IS PARAMOUNT IN RECOGNISING THE AETIOLOGY OF DENTAL EROSION SO THAT DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON THE DENTITION CAN BE PREVENTED.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
18  409  24 BLENDING MARTIAL ARTS AND YOGA FOR HEALTH: FROM THE LAST SAMURAI TO THE FIRST ODAKA YOGA WARRIOR. THIS PAPER INTRODUCES THE CASE STUDY OF ODAKA YOGA, AN INNOVATIVE STYLE OF POSTURAL YOGA BLENDED WITH MARTIAL ARTS ELEMENTS WHICH EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF PRACTITIONERS' HEALTH AND PROCESSES OF SELF-TRANSFORMATION AS PIVOTAL TO THE SCHOOL'S ETHOS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE PAPER EXPLORES HOW ODAKA YOGA'S PHILOSOPHICAL BACKDROPS AND PRACTICAL REPERTOIRE, COMPOSED BY A MIXTURE OF "EXOTIC" RESOURCES SUCH AS BUSHIDO, ZEN, YOGA, AND A CONSTANT REFERENCE TO THE OCEAN WAVES AND BIOMECHANICS, CONSTITUTE A VERY SPECIFIC VISION OF HEALTH AT THE INTERSECTION OF WESTERN SCIENCE AND ESOTERIC KNOWLEDGE. THEORETICALLY, THE PAPER BORROWS FROM JENNINGS' THEORY OF MARTIAL CREATION AND ENRICHES IT WITH SOME OF THE CENTRAL ANALYTICAL TOOLS PROPOSED BY THEORISTS SUCH AS BOURDIEU AND FOUCAULT. METHODOLOGICALLY, IT RELIES ON A MULTIMODAL APPROACH INCLUDING DISCURSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE SCHOOL'S PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS, INTERVIEWS WITH THE FOUNDERS AND OTHER KEY TEACHERS, AND OBSERVANT PARTICIPATION OF PRACTITIONERS' APPRENTICESHIP PROCESSES. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE BIRTH OF ODAKA YOGA AS OCCURRING AT THE INTERSECTION OF ASIAN MARTIAL ARTS AND YOGA, AS WELL AS THE FOUNDERS' BIOGRAPHICAL TRAJECTORIES FROM THE WORLD OF COMPETITIVE MARTIAL ARTS AND FITNESS, TO YOGA; IT THEN TURNS TO AN EXAMINATION OF ODAKA YOGA'S CONCEPTION OF HEALTH AS A MIXTURE OF THE WESTERN BIOMEDICAL MODEL AND THE SUBTLE BODY MODEL OF ASIAN TRADITIONS SUCH AS YOGA AND MARTIAL ARTS. IT ARGUES THAT THE CONCEPTION OF HEALTH PROMOTED BY THIS SCHOOL GIVES RISE TO THE ODAKA YOGA WARRIOR, THE IDEAL-TYPICAL PRACTITIONER WHOSE BODY IS SIMULTANEOUSLY EXPOSED TO THE MEDICAL GAZE AND ITS IMPERATIVES OF CONTROL, KNOWLEDGE, AND MANIPULATION; WHILE IT ALSO DEIFIES IT, AS IT IS ANIMATED BY THE ELUSIVE FLOWS OF ENERGY (QI OR PRANA) THAT PROLONGED PRACTICE AIMS TO MASTER. THE PAPER CONCLUDES WITH A REFLECTION ON HYBRID CONCEPTIONS OF HEALTH AND THE UBIQUITOUS ROLE OF HEALTH DISCOURSES AND NARRATIVES ACROSS SOCIOCULTURAL DOMAINS.	2020	

19  655  22 EEG PAROXYSMAL GAMMA WAVES DURING BHRAMARI PRANAYAMA: A YOGA BREATHING TECHNIQUE. HERE WE REPORT THAT A SPECIFIC FORM OF YOGA CAN GENERATE CONTROLLED HIGH-FREQUENCY GAMMA WAVES. FOR THE FIRST TIME, PAROXYSMAL GAMMA WAVES (PGW) WERE OBSERVED IN EIGHT SUBJECTS PRACTICING A YOGA TECHNIQUE OF BREATHING CONTROL CALLED BHRAMARI PRANAYAMA (BHPR). TO OBTAIN NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE NATURE OF THE EEG DURING BHPR, WE ANALYZED EEG SIGNALS USING TIME-FREQUENCY REPRESENTATIONS (TFR), INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS (ICA), AND EEG TOMOGRAPHY (LORETA). WE FOUND THAT THE PGW CONSISTS OF HIGH-FREQUENCY BIPHASIC RIPPLES. THIS UNUSUAL ACTIVITY IS DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO PREVIOUS REPORTS ON YOGA AND MEDITATION. IT IS CONCLUDED THIS EEG ACTIVITY IS MOST PROBABLY NON-EPILEPTIC, AND THAT APPLYING THE SAME METHODOLOGY TO OTHER MEDITATION RECORDINGS MIGHT YIELD AN IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEUROCORRELATES OF MEDITATION.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
20 2694  13 YOGA INDUCED ACUTE ULNAR NERVE COMPRESSION BY A GANGLION CYST IN GUYON'S CANAL. ACUTE ULNAR NEUROPATHY AT THE WRIST CAN BE DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE, AS IT IS AN UNCOMMON NEUROPATHY WITH VARIABLE CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS AND NUMEROUS ETIOLOGIES. WE PRESENT A CASE OF ACUTE ULNAR NEUROPATHY OF THE DEEP MOTOR BRANCH CAUSED BY A GANGLION CYST IN GUYON'S CANAL. INTERESTINGLY, THIS CASE OF ACUTE LOSS OF MOTOR FUNCTION OCCURRED AFTER THE PATIENT PARTICIPATED IN YOGA (SPECIFICALLY THE DOWNWARD DOG POSITION), AND RESOLVED SPONTANEOUSLY OVER TIME AFTER STOPPING YOGA, WITHOUT SURGICAL EXCISION OF THE GANGLION, SUGGESTING EXACERBATION OR PROTRUSION OF AN OCCULT GANGLION CYST DUE TO INCREASED ACTIVITY AND COMPRESSION OF THE HYPOTHENAR EMINENCE.	2013

1  816 139 EFFECT OF YOGA ON CLINICAL OUTCOMES AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE (LIVE-YOGA). OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY AIMS TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT TO STANDARD THERAPY VERSUS STANDARD THERAPY ALONE ON THE SYMPTOMATIC BURDEN IN PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE (VVS). BACKGROUND: THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) OF PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT VVS. EXISTING MANAGEMENT THERAPIES HAVE BEEN LARGELY INEFFECTIVE. RECENT TRIALS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN DISEASES WITH AUTONOMIC IMBALANCE, SUGGESTING ITS POSSIBLE UTILITY IN VVS. METHODS: PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT VVS WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE EITHER A SPECIALIZED YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM IN ADDITION TO CURRENT GUIDELINE-BASED THERAPY (INTERVENTION ARM, GROUP 1) OR CURRENT GUIDELINE-BASED THERAPY ALONE (CONTROL ARM, GROUP 2). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS A COMPOSITE OF THE NUMBER OF EPISODES OF SYNCOPE AND PRESYNCOPE AT 12 MONTHS. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED QOL ASSESSMENT BY WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION QUALITY OF LIFE BRIEF FIELD QUESTIONNAIRE (WHOQOL-BREF) SCORES AND SYNCOPE FUNCTIONAL STATUS QUESTIONNAIRE SCORES AT 12 MONTHS, HEAD UP TILT TEST, AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY AT 6 WEEKS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 55 PATIENTS UNDERWENT RANDOMIZATION. THE MEAN NUMBER OF SYNCOPAL OR PRESYNCOPAL EVENTS AT 12 MONTHS WAS 0.7 +/- 0.7 IN THE INTERVENTION ARM COMPARED TO 2.52 +/- 1.93 IN THE CONTROL ARM (P < 0.01). IN THE INTERVENTION ARM, 13 (43.3%) PATIENTS REMAINED FREE OF EVENTS VERSUS 4 (16.0%) PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL ARM (P = 0.02). QOL AT 12 MONTHS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OF ALL SYNCOPE FUNCTIONAL STATUS QUESTIONNAIRE SCORES AND 2 DOMAINS OF WHOQOL-BREF SCORES (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: YOGA AS ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY IS SUPERIOR TO STANDARD THERAPY ALONE IN REDUCING THE SYMPTOMATIC BURDEN AND IMPROVING QOL IN PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT VVS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
2 2471  58 YOGA AS A TREATMENT FOR VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: YOGA THERAPY IS BEING USED FOR VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE (VVS). HOWEVER, THERE IS NO SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE. WE AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT TO THE STANDARD THERAPY ON PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT VVS. METHODS: ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE SYSTEMATICALLY SEARCHED TO COLLECT STUDIES ASSESSING THE CLINICAL EFFECTS OF YOGA ALONG WITH GUIDELINE-DIRECTED TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT VVS. THE OUTCOMES WERE THE NUMBER OF VVS ATTACKS AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) ASSESSMENT BY SYNCOPE FUNCTIONAL STATUS QUESTIONNAIRE (SFSQ) SCORES AT 12 MONTHS. WE USED THE MANTEL- HAENSZEL RANDOM-EFFECTS MODEL TO CALCULATE THE MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI). WE USED THE COCHRANE COLLABORATION RISK OF BIAS TOOL AND NEWCASTLE-OTTAWA SCALE FOR RISK OF BIAS ASSESSMENT. RESULTS: FOUR STUDIES WERE INCLUDED, TWO RCTS AND TWO OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES. THE TOTAL OF PARTICIPANTS WAS 309, WITH A MEAN AGE OF 36.4 +/- 13.5 YEARS. THE MALE PARTICIPANTS REPRESENTED 141 (45.6%) BEING MALES. THE BASELINE SYNCOPE BURDEN WAS 3.5 +/- 2.38 EPISODES OVER 15.6 +/- 12.8 MONTHS. YOGA THERAPY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE NUMBER OF EPISODES OF SYNCOPE AND PRESYNCOPE COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP (MD -1.86; 95% CI -3.30, -0.43; P = 0.01). NEVERTHELESS, YOGA THERAPY DID NOT SHOW SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE QOL ASSESSED BY SFSQ SCORES (MD -30.69; 95% CI -62.22,0.83; P = 0.06). CONCLUSION: YOGA THERAPY IS A USEFUL LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION THAT CAN REDUCE THE FREQUENCY OF SYNCOPE AND PRESYNCOPE AMONG PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT VVS. HOWEVER, HIGHER-QUALITY RCTS ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM OUR RESULTS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
3 1923  54 ROLE OF YOGA AS AN ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH NEUROCARDIOGENIC SYNCOPE: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: NEUROCARDIOGENIC SYNCOPE (NCS) IS A COMMON CLINICAL CONDITION CHARACTERIZED BY ABRUPT CARDIOVASCULAR AUTONOMIC CHANGES RESULTING IN SYNCOPE. THIS IS A RECURRING CONDITION WITH MIXED RESULTS FROM CURRENT STRATEGIES OF TREATMENT. METHODS: SUBJECTS WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF NCS WERE SCREENED AND ENROLLED. ALL THE PARTICIPANTS WERE GIVEN A DVD CONTAINING YOGA VIDEOS AND WERE INSTRUCTED TO PRACTICE YOGA THERAPY FOR 60 MIN, THREE TIMES A WEEK FOR 3 CONSECUTIVE MONTHS. SYNCOPE FUNCTIONAL STATUS QUESTIONNAIRE SCORE (SFSQS) WAS ADMINISTERED AT THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF THE STUDY. THE SUBJECTS WERE FOLLOWED FOR 3 MONTHS AND UNDERWENT REPEAT TILT TABLE TESTING AT THE END OF THE STUDY. RESULTS: OF THE 60 PATIENTS SCREENED, 44 SUBJECTS WERE ENROLLED, 21 IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP AND 23 IN THE CONTROL GROUP. MOST OF THE PARTICIPANTS WERE FEMALES, AND THE MEAN AGE WAS 21 +/- 3 YEARS. IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP, WHO FINISHED THE YOGA REGIMEN, THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT FROM CONTROL PHASE TO THE INTERVENTION PHASE, IN NUMBER OF EPISODES OF SYNCOPE (4 +/- 1 VS 1.3 +/- 0.7, P < 0.001) AND PRESYNCOPE (4.7 +/- 1.5 VS 1.5 +/- 0.5, P < 0.001). THE MEAN SFSQS ALSO DECREASED FROM 67 +/- 7.8 TO 29.8 +/- 4.6 (P < 0.001). ALL SUBJECTS HAD POSITIVE HEAD UP TILT TABLE (HUTT) STUDY AT THE TIME OF ENROLLMENT COMPARED TO ONLY SIX PATIENTS AT THE COMPLETION OF INTERVENTION PHASE (10/100 VS 6/28 %, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: YOGA THERAPY CAN POTENTIALLY IMPROVE THE SYMPTOMS OF PRESYNCOPE AND SYNCOPE IN YOUNG FEMALE PATIENTS WITH NCS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
4  190  57 A RANDOMIZED STUDY OF YOGA THERAPY FOR THE PREVENTION OF RECURRENT REFLEX VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE. AIMS: VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE (VVS) IS A COMMON CARDIOVASCULAR DYSAUTONOMIC DISORDER THAT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTS HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE A POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON CARDIOVASCULAR AUTONOMICS. THIS STUDY ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA THERAPY ON THE RECURRENCE OF VVS AND QOL. METHODS AND RESULTS: WE RANDOMIZED SUBJECTS WITH RECURRENT REFLEX VVS (>3 EPISODES IN THE PAST 1 YEAR) AND POSITIVE HEAD-UP TILT TEST TO GUIDELINE-DIRECTED THERAPY (GROUP 1) OR YOGA THERAPY (GROUP 2). PATIENTS IN GROUP 1 WERE ADVISED GUIDELINE-DIRECTED TREATMENT AND GROUP 2 WAS TAUGHT YOGA BY A CERTIFIED INSTRUCTOR. THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT WAS VVS RECURRENCES AND QOL. BETWEEN JUNE 2015 AND FEBRUARY 2017, 97 HIGHLY SYMPTOMATIC VVS PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED (GROUP 1: 47 AND GROUP 2: 50). THE MEAN AGE WAS 33.1 +/- 16.6 YEARS, MALE:FEMALE OF 40:57, SYMPTOM DURATION OF 17.1 +/- 20.7 MONTHS, WITH A MEAN OF 6.4 +/- 6.1 SYNCOPE EPISODES. OVER A FOLLOW-UP OF 14.3 +/- 2.1 MONTHS GROUP 2 HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER SYNCOPE BURDEN COMPARED WITH GROUP 1 AT 3 (0.8 +/- 0.9 VS. 1.8 +/- 1.4, P < 0.001), 6 (1.0 +/- 1.2 VS. 3.4 +/- 3.0, P < 0.001), AND AT 12 MONTHS (1.1 +/- 0.8 VS. 3.8 +/- 3.2, P < 0.001). THE SYNCOPE FUNCTIONAL SCORE QUESTIONNAIRE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN GROUP 2 COMPARED WITH GROUP 1 AT 3 (31.4 +/- 7.2 VS. 64.1 +/- 11.5, P < 0.001), 6 (26.4 +/- 6.3 VS. 61.4 +/- 10.7, P < 0.001), AND 12 MONTHS (22.2 +/- 4.7 VS. 68.3 +/- 11.4, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: FOR PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT VVS, GUIDED YOGA THERAPY IS SUPERIOR TO CONVENTIONAL THERAPY IN REDUCING SYMPTOM BURDEN AND IMPROVING QOL.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
5  428  42 CAN YOGA HAVE ANY EFFECT ON SHOULDER AND ARM PAIN AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER? A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED, SINGLE-BLIND TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SHOULDER AND ARM PAIN, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), DEPRESSION, AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. METHODS: THIS PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED STUDY INCLUDED 42 PATIENTS. THE PATIENTS IN GROUP 1 UNDERWENT A 10-WEEK HATHA YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM. THE PATIENTS IN GROUP 2 WERE INCLUDED IN A 10-WEEK FOLLOW-UP PROGRAM. OUR PRIMARY ENDPOINT WAS ARM AND SHOULDER PAIN INTENSITY. RESULTS: THE GROUP RECEIVING YOGA SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR PAIN SEVERITY FROM BASELINE TO POST-TREATMENT, AND THESE BENEFITS WERE MAINTAINED AT 2.5 MONTHS POST-TREATMENT. WHEN COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP, THERE WERE NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 2 GROUPS WITH RESPECT TO THE PARAMETERS ASSESSED AT THE END OF WEEK 10. CONCLUSION: YOGA WAS AN EFFECTIVE AND SAFE EXERCISE FOR ALLEVIATING SHOULDER AND ARM PAIN, WHICH IS A COMPLICATION WITH A HIGH PREVALENCE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
6 1585  43 MEDICAL YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH STRESS-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSES IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PATIENTS ARE SUFFERING FROM STRESS-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE MEDICAL YOGA TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH STRESS-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSES IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE. A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY WAS PERFORMED AT A PRIMARY HEALTH CARE CENTRE IN SWEDEN FROM MARCH TO JUNE, 2011. PATIENTS WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO A CONTROL GROUP RECEIVING STANDARD CARE OR A YOGA GROUP TREATED WITH MEDICAL YOGA FOR 1 HOUR, ONCE A WEEK, OVER A 12-WEEK PERIOD IN ADDITION TO THE STANDARD CARE. A TOTAL OF 37 MEN AND WOMEN, MEAN AGE OF 53 +/- 12 YEARS WERE INCLUDED. GENERAL STRESS LEVEL (MEASURED USING PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE (PSS)), BURNOUT (SHIROM-MELAMED BURNOUT QUESTIONNAIRE (SMBQ)), ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION (HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE (HADS)), INSOMNIA SEVERITY (INSOMNIA SEVERITY INDEX (ISI)), PAIN (VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS)), AND OVERALL HEALTH STATUS (EURO QUALITY OF LIFE VAS (EQ-VAS)) WERE MEASURED BEFORE AND AFTER 12 WEEKS. PATIENTS ASSIGNED TO THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENTS ON MEASURES OF GENERAL STRESS LEVEL (P < 0.000), ANXIETY (P < 0.019), AND OVERALL HEALTH STATUS (P < 0.018) COMPARED TO CONTROLS. TREATMENT WITH MEDICAL YOGA IS EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING LEVELS OF STRESS AND ANXIETY IN PATIENTS WITH STRESS-RELATED SYMPTOMS IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
7 1402  55 IMPACT OF YOGA ON BLOOD PRESSURE AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION - A CONTROLLED TRIAL IN PRIMARY CARE, MATCHED FOR SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE. BACKGROUND: MEDICAL TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION IS NOT ALWAYS SUFFICIENT TO ACHIEVE BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL. DESPITE THIS, PREVIOUS STUDIES ON SUPPLEMENTARY THERAPIES, SUCH AS YOGA, ARE RELATIVELY FEW. WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF TWO YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON BLOOD PRESSURE AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE DIAGNOSED WITH HYPERTENSION. METHODS: ADULT PATIENTS (AGE 20-80 YEARS) WITH DIAGNOSED HYPERTENSION WERE IDENTIFIED BY AN ELECTRONIC CHART SEARCH AT A PRIMARY HEALTH CARE CENTER IN SOUTHERN SWEDEN. IN TOTAL, 83 SUBJECTS WITH BLOOD PRESSURE VALUES OF 120-179/</=109 MMHG AT BASELINE WERE ENROLLED. AT BASELINE, THE PATIENTS UNDERWENT STANDARDIZED BLOOD PRESSURE MEASUREMENT AT THE HEALTH CARE CENTER AND THEY COMPLETED A QUESTIONNAIRE ON SELF-RATED QUALITY OF LIFE (WHOQOL-BREF). THERE WERE THREE GROUPS: 1) YOGA CLASS WITH YOGA INSTRUCTOR (N = 28); 2) YOGA AT HOME (N = 28); AND 3) A CONTROL GROUP (N = 27). THE PARTICIPANTS WERE MATCHED AT THE GROUP LEVEL FOR SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE. AFTER 12 WEEKS OF INTERVENTION, THE ASSESSMENTS WERE PERFORMED AGAIN. AT BASELINE A MAJORITY OF THE PATIENTS (92%) WERE ON ANTIHYPERTENSIVE MEDICATION, AND THE PATIENTS WERE REQUESTED NOT TO CHANGE THEIR MEDICATION DURING THE STUDY. RESULTS: THE YOGA CLASS GROUP SHOWED NO IMPROVEMENT IN BLOOD PRESSURE OR SELF-RATED QUALITY OF LIFE, WHILE IN THE YOGA AT HOME GROUP THERE WAS A DECLINE IN DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE OF 4.4 MMHG (P < 0.05) COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. MOREOVER, THE YOGA AT HOME GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SELF-RATED QUALITY OF LIFE COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A SHORT YOGA PROGRAM FOR THE PATIENT TO PRACTICE AT HOME SEEMS TO HAVE AN ANTIHYPERTENSIVE EFFECT, AS WELL AS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON SELF-RATED QUALITY OF LIFE COMPARED TO CONTROLS. THIS IMPLIES THAT SIMPLE YOGA EXERCISES MAY BE USEFUL AS A SUPPLEMENTARY BLOOD PRESSURE THERAPY IN ADDITION TO MEDICAL TREATMENT WHEN PRESCRIBED BY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS.	2013	

8  353  43 ASSESSMENT OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA, BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA: A RANDOMISED TRIAL. YOGA WHICH IS USED AS AN ADJUNCT TREATMENT FOR BRONCHIAL ASTHMA IS GAINING POPULARITY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA. 120 NON-SMOKING MALE AND FEMALE PATIENTS OF ASTHMA IN THE AGE GROUP OF 17-50 YEARS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS I.E. GROUP A (YOGA GROUP) AND GROUP B (CONTROL GROUP). ALL PATIENTS REMAINED ON THEIR PRESCRIBED MEDICATION, BUT GROUP A PATIENTS PRACTICED YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES FOR 8 WEEKS. ASTHMA QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE (AQLQ) AND DIARY RECORD WAS USED TO ASSESS QUALITY OF LIFE, NUMBER AND SEVERITY OF ASTHMATIC ATTACKS, AND THE DOSAGE OF THE MEDICATION REQUIRED AT BASELINE AND AFTER 8 WEEKS. GROUP A SUBJECTS SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN "SYMPTOMS", "ACTIVITIES" AND "ENVIRONMENTAL" DOMAINS OF AQLQ AT 8 WEEKS (P<0.01) AND SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DAILY NUMBER AND SEVERITY OF ATTACKS, AND THE DOSAGE OF MEDICATION REQUIRED AT 4 AND 8 WEEKS (P<0.01) COMPARED TO THE BASELINE.

BACKGROUND: CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) ADVERSELY AFFECTS QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) IN NURSING PROFESSIONALS. INTEGRATED YOGA HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON CLBP. STUDIES ASSESSING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CLBP IN NURSING POPULATION ARE LACKING. AIM: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF INTEGRATED YOGA AND PHYSICAL EXERCISES ON QOL IN NURSES WITH CLBP. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 88 WOMEN NURSES FROM A TERTIARY CARE HOSPITAL OF SOUTH INDIA WERE RANDOMIZED INTO YOGA GROUP (N = 44; AGE - 31.45 +/- 3.47 YEARS) AND PHYSICAL EXERCISE GROUP (N = 44; AGE - 32.75 +/- 3.71 YEARS). YOGA GROUP WAS INTERVENED WITH INTEGRATED YOGA THERAPY MODULE PRACTICES, 1 H/DAY AND 5 DAYS A WEEK FOR 6 WEEKS. PHYSICAL EXERCISE GROUP PRACTICED A SET OF PHYSICAL EXERCISES FOR THE SAME DURATION. ALL PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND AFTER 6 WEEKS WITH THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION QUALITY OF LIFE-BRIEF (WHOQOL-BREF) QUESTIONNAIRE. RESULTS: DATA WERE ANALYZED BY PAIRED-SAMPLES T-TEST AND INDEPENDENT-SAMPLES T-TEST FOR WITHIN- AND BETWEEN-GROUP COMPARISONS, RESPECTIVELY, USING THE STATISTICAL PACKAGE FOR THE SOCIAL SCIENCES (SPSS). WITHIN-GROUP ANALYSIS FOR QOL REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND SOCIAL DOMAINS (EXCEPT ENVIRONMENTAL DOMAIN) IN BOTH GROUPS. BETWEEN-GROUP ANALYSIS SHOWED A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF IMPROVEMENT IN YOGA AS COMPARED TO EXERCISE GROUP EXCEPT ENVIRONMENTAL DOMAIN. CONCLUSIONS: INTEGRATED YOGA WAS SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS IN PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND SOCIAL HEALTH DOMAINS OF QOL BETTER THAN PHYSICAL EXERCISES AMONG NURSING PROFESSIONALS WITH CLBP. THERE IS A NEED TO INCORPORATE YOGA AS LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION FOR NURSING PROFESSIONALS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
10 1041  43 EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON SLEEP AND QUALITY-OF-LIFE IN ELDERLY: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. CONTEXT: YOGA AS A LIFE-STYLE PRACTICE HAS DEMONSTRATED BENEFICIAL EFFECTS. THE ROLE OF YOGA IN THE ELDERLY FOR SUCH BENEFITS MERITS INVESTIGATION. AIMS: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON QUALITY-OF-LIFE (QOL) AND SLEEP QUALITY IN THE ELDERLY LIVING IN OLD AGE HOMES. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: SINGLE BLIND CONTROLLED STUDY WITH BLOCK RANDOMIZATION OF ELDERLY HOMES. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 120 SUBJECTS FROM NINE ELDERLY HOMES WERE RANDOMIZED IN TO YOGA GROUP (N=62) AND WAITLIST GROUP (N=58). SUBJECTS IN THE YOGA GROUP WERE GIVEN YOGA INTERVENTION DAILY FOR 1 MONTH AND WEEKLY UNTIL 3 MONTHS AND WERE ENCOURAGED TO PRACTICE YOGA WITHOUT SUPERVISION UNTIL FOR 6 MONTHS. SUBJECTS IN WAITLIST GROUP RECEIVED NO INTERVENTION DURING THIS PERIOD. SUBJECTS WERE EVALUATED WITH WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION QUALITY OF LIFE (WHOQOL)-BREF FOR MEASURING QOL AND PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX FOR SLEEP QUALITY IN THE BASELINE AND AFTER 6 MONTHS. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: INDEPENDENT T-TEST AND REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE RESPECTIVELY WAS USED TO MEASURE THE DIFFERENCE IN OUTCOME MEASURES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS AT BASELINE AND AFTER THE STUDY PERIOD. RESULTS: SUBJECTS IN THE YOGA GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NUMBER OF YEARS OF FORMAL EDUCATION. SUBJECTS IN THE YOGA GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ALL THE DOMAINS OF QOL AND TOTAL SLEEP QUALITY AFTER CONTROLLING FOR THE EFFECT OF BASELINE DIFFERENCE IN EDUCATION BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. CONCLUSION: YOGA INTERVENTION APPEARS TO IMPROVE THE QOL AND SLEEP QUALITY OF ELDERLY LIVING IN OLD AGE HOMES. THERE IS A NEED FOR FURTHER STUDIES OVERCOMING THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS STUDY TO CONFIRM THE BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR ELDERLY IN QOL AND SLEEP QUALITY.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
11 1731  41 PERSONALIZED YOGA THERAPY FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: EFFECT ON SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT AND QUALITY OF LIFE. THIS STUDY AIMED TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF PERSONALIZED YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION IN A PRIVATE SETTING AND ITS EFFECT ON QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), SLEEP QUALITY, AND SYMPTOM RELIEF AMONG PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS). A SINGLE-GROUP PRE- AND POST-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AMONG 10 MEMBERS OF THE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS SOCIETY OF INDIA BETWEEN DECEMBER 2017 AND APRIL 2018. AT BASELINE AND DURING FOLLOW-UP, QOL, SLEEP QUALITY, SYMPTOMS, AND PAIN WERE ASSESSED USING THE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS QUALITY OF LIFE, PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX, MS SYMPTOM CHECKLIST, AND VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE, RESPECTIVELY. THE INTERVENTION COMPRISED 12 PRIVATE CUSTOMIZED YOGA SESSIONS OF 1 HOUR DURATION AND THREE GROUP SESSIONS, ALL SPREAD OVER 3-MONTHS. PATIENT FEEDBACK AND DIRECT OBSERVATIONS BY THE YOGA THERAPIST WE RE DOCUMENTED AT EACH SESSION. TEN PATIENTS (SEVEN FEMALE, THREE MALE, AGE 31-52 YEARS) WERE ENROLLED IN THE YOGA INTERVENTION; SEVEN COMPLETED 8-12 SESSIONS, AND THREE COMPLETED FEWER THAN 5 SESSIONS. THERAPIST-TO-PATIENT RATIO WAS 1:2. ALL DOMAINS EXCEPT SEXUAL FUNCTION SHOWED CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN QOL SCORES. STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT WAS FOUND IN SOCIAL FUNCTION (P = 0.014) AND CHANGE IN HEALTH STATUS (P = 0.029) SCORES AFTER THE INTERVENTION. ALTHOUGH THERE WAS IMPROVEMENT IN PAIN AND SLEEP QUALITY, THESE CHANGES WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. PATIENTS REPORTED IMPROVEMENT IN SYMPTOMS WITH PRACTICE OF YOGA ALONGSIDE LIFESTYLE CHANGES. THE STUDY SUPPORTS THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS 3-MONTH YOGA INTERVENTION FOR PATIENTS WITH MS. STUDIES WITH LARGER SAMPLE SIZES ARE REQUIRED TO CONFIRM OUR FINDINGS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
12 2883  33 YOGA: A TOOL FOR IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN CHRONIC PANCREATITIS. AIM: TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA ON IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS OF CHRONIC PANCREATITIS. METHODS: THE PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO TWO GROUPS. THE CONTROL GROUP CONTINUED THEIR USUAL CARE AS DIRECTED BY THEIR PHYSICIANS. PATIENTS IN THE YOGA GROUP, IN ADDITION, RECEIVED BIWEEKLY YOGA SESSIONS FOR 12 WK. THE PATIENTS' DEMOGRAPHIC AND HEALTH BEHAVIOUR VARIABLES WERE ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER THE YOGA PROGRAMME USING MEDICAL OUTCOMES SHORT FORM (SF-36) FOR QUALITY OF LIFE, PROFILE OF MOOD STATES FOR ASSESSING MOOD AND SYMPTOMS OF STRESS INVENTORY FOR MEASURING STRESS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 60 PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED, WITH 8 DROP-OUTS. THIRTY PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO THE YOGA GROUP AND 30 TO THE CONTROL GROUP. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE SEEN IN OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE, SYMPTOMS OF STRESS, MOOD CHANGES, ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE AND APPETITE AFTER THE 12 WK PERIOD APART FROM THE GENERAL FEELING OF WELL-BEING AND DESIRE TO CONTINUE WITH THE PROGRAMME IN FUTURE IN THE YOGA GROUP, WHILE THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: YOGA IS EFFECTIVE ON IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS OF CHRONIC PANCREATITIS.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
13 1075  43 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PHASE ANGLE AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER: A RANDOMIZED, SINGLE-BLIND, CONTROLLED TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: PHASE ANGLE (PA), A PARAMETER THAT IS OBTAINED FROM BODY COMPOSITION ANALYSIS, IS AN INDICATOR OF CELLULAR HEALTH STATUS. A LOWER PA IN CANCER PATIENTS CAN LEAD TO A DECREASE IN FUNCTIONAL STATUS AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AND INCREASED MORTALITY. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY INCREASES PA. IN THIS STUDY, WE AIMED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA ON PA, BODY COMPOSITION, AND QOL IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. METHODS: THIRTY-ONE PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO THE YOGA (GROUP 1, N = 15) AND THE CONTROL GROUP (GROUP 2, N = 16). HATHA YOGA WAS PRACTICED TWICE A WEEK FOR 10 WEEKS IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP. THE PA OF THE PATIENTS WAS ASSESSED USING A BODY ANALYSIS INSTRUMENT, AND QOL WAS EVALUATED WITH AN EORTC QLQ QUESTIONNAIRE BOTH BEFORE TREATMENT AND AT WEEK 10. RESULTS: GROUP 1 HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE POSTTREATMENT EORTC QLQ FUNCTIONAL AND GLOBAL SCORES (P < 0.05). IN GROUP 2, A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT WAS OBSERVED IN THE EORTC QLQ SYMPTOM SUBSCALE (P = 0.035). PA VALUES DID NOT SHOW ANY IMPROVEMENTS IN BOTH GROUPS (P > 0.05). COMPARISON OF THE 2 GROUPS REVEALED NO DIFFERENCES. CONCLUSION: YOGA MAY HAVE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON QOL IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER BUT DOES NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON PA. THERE IS A NEED FOR FURTHER STUDIES TO MAKE A DEFINITIVE STATEMENT.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
14 2644  38 YOGA FOR WOMEN WITH URGENCY URINARY INCONTINENCE: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVES: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF A GENTLE YOGA PROGRAM FOR WOMEN WITH URGENCY URINARY INCONTINENCE (UUI). ALSO, THESE PRELIMINARY DATA CAN EVALUATE IF YOGA IMPROVES SYMPTOM BURDEN, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS FOR WOMEN WITH UUI. METHODS: THIS PROSPECTIVE NONRANDOMIZED SINGLE-ARM PILOT STUDY EVALUATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A TWICE-WEEKLY, 8-WEEK GENTLE YOGA INTERVENTION TO REDUCE UUI SYMPTOM BURDEN. CHANGES IN SYMPTOM BURDEN WERE MEASURED USING THE PELVIC FLOOR DISTRESS INVENTORY 20. SECONDARY MEASURES INCLUDED QUALITY OF LIFE, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, SLEEP, STRESS, ANXIETY, AND INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS. OUTCOMES WERE EVALUATED WITH PAIRED T TESTING. RESULTS: TWELVE WOMEN COMPLETED THE YOGA INTERVENTION WITH NO ADVERSE OUTCOMES NOTED. URGENCY SYMPTOM BURDEN WAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED AFTER THE INTERVENTION (P = 0.01), AND WOMEN REPORTED AN INCREASE IN QUALITY OF LIFE (P = 0.04) AFTER THE YOGA INTERVENTION. FOLLOWING THE YOGA INTERVENTION, THE MAJORITY OF WOMEN REPORTED SYMPTOMS AS "MUCH BETTER" (N = 4 [33%]) AND "A LITTLE BETTER" (N = 5 [42%]), WITH 3 WOMEN (25%) REPORTING "NO CHANGE." WOMEN ALSO REPORTED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (P = 0.03) AND BETTER QUALITY OF SLEEP (P = 0.03). NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE FOUND IN ANXIETY OR STRESS PERCEPTION. PLASMA LEVELS OF THE INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKER TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR ALPHA WERE REDUCED AFTER YOGA INTERVENTION (P = 0.009); HOWEVER, NO SIGNIFICANT POSTYOGA CHANGES WERE FOUND FOR INTERLEUKIN 6 OR C-REACTIVE PROTEIN. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY PROVIDES PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE THAT YOGA IS A FEASIBLE COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY THAT REDUCES INCONTINENCE SYMPTOM BURDEN, ALONG WITH IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, AND SLEEP QUALITY. ADDITIONALLY, YOGA MAY LOWER INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS ASSOCIATED WITH INCONTINENCE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
15  831  46 EFFECT OF YOGA ON MIGRAINE: A COMPREHENSIVE STUDY USING CLINICAL PROFILE AND CARDIAC AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS. CONTEXT AND AIMS: MIGRAINE IS AN EPISODIC DISABLING HEADACHE REQUIRING LONG-TERM MANAGEMENT. MIGRAINE MANAGEMENT THROUGH YOGA THERAPY WOULD REDUCE THE MEDICATION COST WITH POSITIVE HEALTH BENEFITS. YOGA HAS SHOWN TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE, REDUCE THE EPISODE OF HEADACHE AND MEDICATION. THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA AS AN ADJUVANT THERAPY IN MIGRAINE PATIENTS BY ASSESSING CLINICAL OUTCOME AND AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS TESTS. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: MIGRAINE PATIENTS WERE RANDOMLY GIVEN EITHER CONVENTIONAL CARE (N = 30) OR YOGA WITH CONVENTIONAL CARE (N = 30). YOGA GROUP RECEIVED YOGA PRACTICE SESSION FOR 5 DAYS A WEEK FOR 6 WEEKS ALONG WITH CONVENTIONAL CARE. CLINICAL ASSESSMENT (FREQUENCY, INTENSITY OF HEADACHE AND HEADACHE IMPACT) AND AUTONOMIC FUNCTION TEST WERE DONE AT BASELINE AND AT THE END OF THE INTERVENTION. RESULTS: YOGA WITH CONVENTIONAL CARE AND CONVENTION CARE GROUPS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN CLINICAL VARIABLES, BUT IT WAS BETTER WITH YOGA THERAPY. IMPROVEMENT IN THE VAGAL TONE ALONG WITH REDUCED SYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY WAS OBSERVED IN PATIENTS WITH MIGRAINE RECEIVING YOGA AS ADJUVANT THERAPY. CONCLUSIONS: INTERVENTION SHOWED SIGNIFICANT CLINICAL IMPROVEMENT IN BOTH GROUPS. HEADACHE FREQUENCY AND INTENSITY WERE REDUCED MORE IN YOGA WITH CONVENTIONAL CARE THAN THE CONVENTIONAL CARE GROUP ALONE. FURTHERMORE, YOGA THERAPY ENHANCED THE VAGAL TONE AND DECREASED THE SYMPATHETIC DRIVE, HENCE IMPROVING THE CARDIAC AUTONOMIC BALANCE. THUS, YOGA THERAPY CAN BE EFFECTIVELY INCORPORATED AS AN ADJUVANT THERAPY IN MIGRAINE PATIENTS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
16 2003  49 STUDY OF ADDITIVE EFFECT OF YOGA AND PHYSICAL THERAPIES TO STANDARD PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT IN MIGRAINE. OBJECTIVE WE AIMED TO EVALUATE AND COMPARE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PHYSICAL AND YOGA THERAPIES AS AN ADJUVANT THERAPY ALONG WITH STANDARD PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH MIGRAINE. MATERIALS AND METHODS A TOTAL OF 61 CONSENTING PATIENTS DIAGNOSED TO HAVE MIGRAINE WERE RANDOMIZED INTO THREE GROUPS TO RECEIVE EITHER STANDARD TREATMENT ALONE, PHYSICAL THERAPY ALONG WITH STANDARD TREATMENT, OR YOGA THERAPY ALONG WITH STANDARD TREATMENT. THE RESPECTIVE ADJUVANT INTERVENTION WAS TAUGHT TO THE RESPECTIVE GROUP OF PATIENTS AND THEY WERE ADVISED TO PERFORM IT DAILY FOR 3 MONTHS WITH WEEKLY TELEPHONIC REMINDERS AND REVIEW OF THEIR ACTIVITY LOGS. OUTCOME MEASURES ASSESSED WERE HEADACHE FREQUENCY, SHORT-FORM MCGILL PAIN QUESTIONNAIRE (SF-MPQ), AND HEADACHE IMPACT TEST-6 (HIT-6) AT RECRUITMENT AND ONCE EVERY MONTH FOR 3 MONTHS. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE STUDY WAS DONE BY USING STATA 14.1 SOFTWARE. ALL THE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS, PAIRED T -TEST WAS USED TO COMPARE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRE AND POSTINTERVENTION VALUES OF HEADACHE FREQUENCY, SF-MPQ, AND HIT-6 SCORE WITHIN ALL THE THREE GROUPS. ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE TEST AND POST HOC TEST WERE USED TO COMPARE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ALL GROUPS FOR OUTCOME MEASURES ( P < 0.05). RESULTS HEADACHE FREQUENCY AND THE VISUAL ANALOG SCALE BEFORE INTERVENTION COMPARED DURING EACH MONTH INTERVALS FOR 3 MONTHS IN ALL THE THREE GROUPS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED IN ALL THE THREE GROUPS ( P < 0.005). YOGA OR PHYSICAL THERAPY AS AN ADJUVANT TO STANDARD TREATMENT LEADS TO A HIGHER REDUCTION IN HEADACHE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY. SENSORY AND AFFECTIVE PAIN RATINGS OF SF-MPQ AND HIT-6 ALSO SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT AT 1 TO 3 MONTHS OF TREATMENT COMPARED WITH BASELINE IN ALL THE THREE GROUPS. CONCLUSION EITHER PHYSICAL OR YOGA THERAPY AS AN ADJUVANT TO STANDARD PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT MAY FURTHER IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND REDUCE HEADACHE FREQUENCY IN PATIENTS WITH MIGRAINE.	2021	
                                                                       
17  877  35 EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY ON SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY IN CANCER PATIENTS. BACKGROUND: MANY CANCER PATIENTS SUFFER FROM SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND FATIGUE. SUPPORTIVE TREATMENTS ARE INCREASINGLY USED TO ALLEVIATE DISTRESS IN CANCER. IN THIS STUDY, THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON THESE SYMPTOMS ARE EXAMINED. METHODS: WE PERFORMED A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY ON CANCER PATIENTS WITH MIXED DIAGNOSES COMPARING YOGA THERAPY WITH A WAITING LIST CONTROL GROUP. WE MEASURED ANXIETY SYMPTOMS WITH THE GENERAL ANXIETY DISORDER (GAD-7) SCALE, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS WITH THE PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE-2 (PHQ-2), AND FATIGUE WITH THE EUROPEAN ORGANISATION FOR RESEARCH AND TREATMENT OF CANCER FATIGUE SCALE (EORTC QLQ-FA13). YOGA THERAPY WAS CARRIED OUT IN WEEKLY SESSIONS OF 60 MIN EACH FOR 8 WEEKS. THE PROGRAM PROVIDED RESTRAINED BODY AND BREATHING EXERCISES AS WELL AS MEDITATION. THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT RECEIVE ANY YOGA THERAPY WHILE ON THE WAITING LIST. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 70 SUBJECTS PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY. ANXIETY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BY THE YOGA THERAPY IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP (P = 0.005). HOWEVER, YOGA THERAPY DID NOT SHOW ANY SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON DEPRESSION (P = 0.21) AND FATIGUE (P = 0.11) COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: YOGA THERAPY MAY BE USED TO ALLEVIATE ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IN CANCER PATIENTS AND SHOULD BE THE SUBJECT OF FURTHER RESEARCH.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
18 2235  34 THE IMPACT OF YOGA UPON FEMALE PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM HYPOTHYROIDISM. OBJECTIVE: TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF FEMALE HYPOTHYROID PATIENTS. DESIGN: THE WHO QUALITY OF LIFE SCALE(22) WAS USED TO ASSESS THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF 20 FEMALE HYPOTHYROID PATIENTS. SUBJECTS ATTENDED ONE HOUR YOGA SESSIONS DAILY FOR A PERIOD OF ONE MONTH. A PRETEST-POST-TEST RESEARCH DESIGN WAS USED FOR DATA ANALYSIS. RESULTS: PATIENTS' QUALITY OF LIFE SCORES FOLLOWING THE YOGA PROGRAM WERE GREATER THAN SCORES OBTAINED PRIOR TO UNDERTAKING YOGA (P < 0.01). PATIENTS ALSO REPORTED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR PERCEPTION OF THE OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE AND OF THEIR HEALTH POST YOGA INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT YOGA IS VALUABLE IN HELPING THE HYPOTHYROID PATIENTS TO MANAGE THEIR DISEASE-RELATED SYMPTOMS. YOGA MAY BE CONSIDERED AS SUPPORTIVE OR COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY IN CONJUNCTION WITH MEDICAL THERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF HYPOTHYROID DISORDER.	2011

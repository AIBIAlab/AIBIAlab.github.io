1  256 148 A YOGA-BASED PROGRAM DECREASES PHYSICIAN BURNOUT IN NEONATOLOGISTS AND OBSTETRICIANS AT AN ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER. BACKGROUND: NEARLY HALF OF U.S. PEDIATRICIANS HAVE SYMPTOMS OF BURNOUT. THIS PILOT STUDY EXAMINED THE FEASIBILITY OF A 6-WEEK YOGA-BASED PROGRAM (RISE) FOR NEONATOLOGISTS AND OBSTETRICIANS AT BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL AND STUDIED THE EFFECTS ON BURNOUT, PROFESSIONAL FULFILLMENT, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED VIA EMAIL TO PARTICIPATE EITHER IN BOTH PROGRAM AND RESEARCH STUDY, OR EXCLUSIVELY THE PROGRAM. RISE WAS DELIVERED 1 HOUR/WEEK DURING THE WORKDAY FOR 6 CONSECUTIVE WEEKS EITHER IN-PERSON OR REMOTELY; 18 PHYSICIANS PARTICIPATED, 12 COMPLETED POST-PROGRAM, AND 11 COMPLETED 2-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. THE QUESTIONNAIRES ASSESSED BURNOUT AND MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH, PROFESSIONAL FULFILLMENT, WORK EXHAUSTION, INTERPERSONAL DISENGAGEMENT/BURNOUT (PFI), MINDFULNESS (FFMQ), PERCEIVED STRESS (PSS), POSITIVE/NEGATIVE AFFECT (PANAS), RESILIENCE (RS), ANXIETY/DEPRESSION/SLEEP DISTURBANCES (PROMIS), AT BASELINE, POST-PROGRAM, AND 2 MONTHS AFTER RISE. FINDINGS: AVERAGE ATTENDANCE IN-PERSON WAS 2.8 SESSIONS AND REMOTELY 1.4 SESSIONS (4.2/6 SESSIONS). PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATING TOTAL BURNOUT REDUCED FROM 50.0% AT BASELINE TO 9.1% POST-PROGRAM. PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATING PROFESSIONAL FULFILLMENT WERE 8.3% AT BASELINE AND 27.3% POST-PROGRAM. PAIRED SAMPLES T-TESTS REVEALED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN BURNOUT, PROFESSIONAL FULFILLMENT, INTERPERSONAL DISENGAGEMENT, STRESS, RESILIENCE, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION AT POST-PROGRAM COMPARED WITH BASELINE (N = 12, ALL PS < .05). AT 2-MONTH FOLLOW-UP, STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN INTERPERSONAL DISENGAGEMENT, RESILIENCE, AND MINDFULNESS (N = 11, ALL PS < .05) COMPARED WITH BASELINE WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS/APPLICATION TO PRACTICE: RISE IS FEASIBLE WITHIN A WORKDAY AND MAY ADDRESS BURNOUT AND OTHER PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH MEASURES IN PHYSICIANS WITH EFFECTS POTENTIALLY SUSTAINABLE OVER 2 MONTHS. OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH PRACTITIONERS IN HEALTH CARE SHOULD CONSIDER THIS TYPE OF INTERVENTION FOR THEIR WORKERS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
2 2387  39 YOGA AMELIORATES PERFORMANCE ANXIETY AND MOOD DISTURBANCE IN YOUNG PROFESSIONAL MUSICIANS. YOGA AND MEDITATION CAN ALLEVIATE STRESS, ANXIETY, MOOD DISTURBANCE, AND MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS, AND CAN ENHANCE COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE. PROFESSIONAL MUSICIANS EXPERIENCE HIGH LEVELS OF STRESS, PERFORMANCE ANXIETY, AND DEBILITATING PERFORMANCE-RELATED MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS (PRMDS). THE GOAL OF THIS CONTROLLED STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE BENEFITS OF YOGA AND MEDITATION FOR MUSICIANS. YOUNG ADULT PROFESSIONAL MUSICIANS WHO VOLUNTEERED TO PARTICIPATE IN A 2-MONTH PROGRAM OF YOGA AND MEDITATION WERE RANDOMIZED TO A YOGA LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 15) OR TO A GROUP PRACTICING YOGA AND MEDITATION ONLY (N = 15). ADDITIONAL MUSICIANS WERE RECRUITED TO A NO-PRACTICE CONTROL GROUP (N = 15). BOTH YOGA GROUPS ATTENDED THREE KRIPALU YOGA OR MEDITATION CLASSES EACH WEEK. THE YOGA LIFESTYLE GROUP ALSO EXPERIENCED WEEKLY GROUP PRACTICE AND DISCUSSION SESSIONS AS PART OF THEIR MORE IMMERSIVE TREATMENT. ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED BASELINE AND END-PROGRAM SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES THAT EVALUATED MUSIC PERFORMANCE ANXIETY, MOOD, PRMDS, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND SLEEP QUALITY; MANY PARTICIPANTS LATER COMPLETED A 1-YEAR FOLLOWUP ASSESSMENT USING THE SAME QUESTIONNAIRES. BOTH YOGA GROUPS SHOWED A TREND TOWARDS LESS MUSIC PERFORMANCE ANXIETY AND SIGNIFICANTLY LESS GENERAL ANXIETY/TENSION, DEPRESSION, AND ANGER AT END-PROGRAM RELATIVE TO CONTROLS, BUT SHOWED NO CHANGES IN PRMDS, STRESS, OR SLEEP. SIMILAR RESULTS IN THE TWO YOGA GROUPS, DESPITE PSYCHOSOCIAL DIFFERENCES IN THEIR INTERVENTIONS, SUGGEST THAT THE YOGA AND MEDITATION TECHNIQUES THEMSELVES MAY HAVE MEDIATED THE IMPROVEMENTS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA AND MEDITATION TECHNIQUES CAN REDUCE PERFORMANCE ANXIETY AND MOOD DISTURBANCE IN YOUNG PROFESSIONAL MUSICIANS.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
3  960  37 EFFECTS OF A YOGA LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION ON PERFORMANCE-RELATED CHARACTERISTICS OF MUSICIANS: A PRELIMINARY STUDY. BACKGROUND: PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS SUGGESTED THAT YOGA AND MEDITATION PRACTICES ARE EFFECTIVE IN STRESS MANAGEMENT, ALLEVIATING ANXIETY AND MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS AND IMPROVING MOOD AND COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE. MUSICIANS EXPERIENCE A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES IN THEIR PROFESSION INCLUDING HIGH LEVELS OF STRESS, PERFORMANCE ANXIETY AND PERFORMANCE-RELATED MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS. YOGA AND MEDITATION TECHNIQUES ARE THEREFORE POTENTIALLY USEFUL PRACTICES FOR PROFESSIONAL MUSICIANS. MATERIAL/METHODS: MUSICIANS ENROLLED IN A PRESTIGIOUS 2-MONTH SUMMER FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM WERE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN A REGULAR YOGA AND MEDITATION PROGRAM AT A YOGA CENTER DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROGRAM. THE 10 PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA PROGRAM COMPLETED BASELINE AND END-PROGRAM QUESTIONNAIRES EVALUATING PERFORMANCE-RELATED MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS, PERFORMANCE ANXIETY, MOOD AND FLOW EXPERIENCE. FELLOWS NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE YOGA PROGRAM WERE RECRUITED TO SERVE AS CONTROLS AND COMPLETED THE SAME ASSESSMENTS (N=8). RESULTS: THE YOGA PARTICIPANTS SHOWED SOME IMPROVEMENTS RELATIVE TO CONTROL SUBJECTS ON MOST MEASURES, WITH THE RELATIVE IMPROVEMENT IN PERFORMANCE ANXIETY BEING THE GREATEST. CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS FROM THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY SUGGEST THAT YOGA AND MEDITATION MAY BE BENEFICIAL AS A ROUTINE PRACTICE TO REDUCE PERFORMANCE ANXIETY IN MUSICIANS.	2006	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
4 2515  27 YOGA CLASSES AS AN EARLY INTERVENTION FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS REPORTING HIGH LEVELS OF STRESS AND ANXIETY: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND:TODAY'S COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE EXPERIENCING UNPRECEDENTED RATES OF STRESS, ANXIETY, AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. AS A RESULT, COLLEGE COUNSELING CENTERS ARE OFTEN OVERWHELMED BY THE DEMAND FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. METHODS: THE CURRENT STUDY EVALUATED THE POTENTIAL FOR HATHA YOGA CLASSES TO BE USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO CONVENTIONAL PSYCHOTHERAPY FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS REPORTING HIGH LEVELS OF STRESS AND ANXIETY. RESULTS: AFTER 6 WEEKS OF TWICE-WEEKLY, HOUR-LONG YOGA CLASSES, SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN STRESS, ANXIETY, PATHOLOGICAL WORRY, AND RUMINATION WERE REPORTED BY 7 UNDERGRADUATE COLLEGE STUDENTS. CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS OF THIS PILOT STUDY SUGGEST THAT HATHA YOGA CLASSES MAY SERVE AS A WIDELY ACCESSIBLE, COST-EFFECTIVE EARLY INTERVENTION THAT CAN BE OFFERED AS A FIRST-LINE RECOMMENDATION TO STUDENTS WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH HEIGHTENED LEVELS OF STRESS AND ANXIETY.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
5  599  35 DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING OF AN AUDIO-VISUAL SELF-HELP YOGA MANUAL FOR INDIAN CAREGIVERS OF PERSONS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA LIVING IN THE COMMUNITY: A SINGLE-BLIND RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: TO TEST THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF AN AUDIO-VISUAL SELF-HELP AUDIO-VISUAL YOGA MANUAL ON BURDEN OF INDIAN CAREGIVERS OF PERSONS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA, LIVING IN THE COMMUNITY. METHODS: AN EARLIER DEVELOPED YOGA PROGRAM FOR CAREGIVERS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA WAS REMODELED INTO AN AUDIO-VISUAL SELF-HELP MANUAL IN THREE LANGUAGES AND VALIDATED BY MENTAL HEALTH AND YOGA EXPERTS. 48 CONSENTING PRIMARY FAMILY CAREGIVERS OF OUTPATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA WERE SCREENED, RECRUITED, AND ALLOTTED RANDOMLY TO YOGA OR CARE AS USUAL GROUP. PARTICIPANTS IN YOGA GROUP WERE TAUGHT YOGA FROM THE SELF-HELP MANUAL (1 SESSION OF 1 H EVERY MONTH FOR 5 MONTHS). THE CAREGIVERS WERE ASKED TO FOLLOW THE MANUAL FOR THE REMAINING MONTH AT HOME. ASSESSMENTS OF BURDEN, PERCEIVED STRESS, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND ANXIETY-DEPRESSION WERE CONDUCTED BY A RATER BLIND TO THE GROUP STATUS AT BASELINE AND AT THE END OF EVERY MONTH. RESULTS: POST FACTORING FOR MISSING DATA, REPEATEDMEASURE ANOVA WAS CONDUCTED; WHICH SHOWED THAT THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GROUP THAT PRACTICED THE SELFHELP YOGA MANUAL AND THE CARE AS USUAL GROUP. THE CAREGIVERS WHO PRACTICED YOGA AT HOME MAINTAINED AN AVERAGE OF 50% ATTENDANCE AND "VERY WELL" LEVEL OF YOGA PERFORMANCE. CONCLUSION: THE AUDIO-VISUAL SELF-HELP YOGA MANUAL WAS FOUND TO BE FEASIBLE TO USE BY THE CAREGIVERS EVEN THOUGH ITS EFFECTIVENESS COULD NOT BE ASCERTAINED DUE TO HIGH ATTRITION.	2020

THERE ARE NO LONG-TERM DATA COMPARING CBT AND YOGA FOR WORRY, ANXIETY, AND SLEEP IN OLDER ADULTS. THE IMPACT OF PREFERENCE AND SELECTION ON THESE OUTCOMES IS UNKNOWN. IN THIS SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS, WE COMPARED LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF CBT BY TELEPHONE AND YOGA ON WORRY, ANXIETY, SLEEP, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, FATIGUE, PHYSICAL FUNCTION, SOCIAL PARTICIPATION, AND PAIN; AND EXAMINED PREFERENCE AND SELECTION EFFECTS. DESIGN: IN THIS RANDOMIZED PREFERENCE TRIAL, PARTICIPANTS (N = 500) WERE RANDOMIZED TO A: 1) RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) OF CBT OR YOGA (N = 250); OR 2) PREFERENCE TRIAL (SELECTED CBT OR YOGA; N = 250). OUTCOMES WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE AND WEEK 37. SETTING: COMMUNITY. PARTICIPANTS: COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS (AGE 60+ YEARS). INTERVENTIONS: CBT (BY TELEPHONE) AND YOGA (IN-PERSON GROUP CLASSES). MEASUREMENTS: PENN STATE WORRY QUESTIONNAIRE - ABBREVIATED (WORRY);(1)(,)(2) INSOMNIA SEVERITY INDEX (SLEEP);(3) PROMIS ANXIETY SHORT FORM V1.0 (ANXIETY);(4)(,)(5) GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER SCREENER (GENERALIZED ANXIETY);(6)(,)(7) AND PROMIS-29 (DEPRESSION, FATIGUE, PHYSICAL FUNCTION, SOCIAL PARTICIPATION, PAIN).(8)(,)(9) RESULTS: SIX MONTHS AFTER INTERVENTION COMPLETION, CBT AND YOGA RCT PARTICIPANTS REPORTED SUSTAINED IMPROVEMENTS FROM BASELINE IN WORRY, ANXIETY, SLEEP, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, FATIGUE, AND SOCIAL PARTICIPATION (NO SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCES). USING DATA COMBINED FROM THE RANDOMIZED AND PREFERENCE TRIALS, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT PREFERENCE OR SELECTION EFFECTS. LONG-TERM INTERVENTION EFFECTS WERE OBSERVED AT CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL LEVELS FOR MOST OF THE STUDY OUTCOMES. CONCLUSIONS: CBT AND YOGA BOTH DEMONSTRATED MAINTAINED IMPROVEMENTS FROM BASELINE ON MULTIPLE OUTCOMES SIX MONTHS AFTER INTERVENTION COMPLETION IN A LARGE SAMPLE OF OLDER ADULTS.

7 2535  32 YOGA ENHANCES POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL STATES IN YOUNG ADULT MUSICIANS. ALTHOUGH YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE A VIABLE TECHNIQUE FOR IMPROVING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE MIND AND BODY, LITTLE ATTENTION HAS BEEN DIRECTED TO STUDYING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOGA AND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL STATES OF FLOW AND MINDFULNESS. MUSICIANS ENROLLED IN A 2-MONTH FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM IN 2005, 2006 AND 2007 WERE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN A YOGA AND MEDITATION PROGRAM. FELLOWS NOT PARTICIPATING IN THE YOGA PROGRAM WERE RECRUITED SEPARATELY AS CONTROLS. ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED BASELINE AND END-PROGRAM QUESTIONNAIRES EVALUATING DISPOSITIONAL FLOW, MINDFULNESS, CONFUSION, AND MUSIC PERFORMANCE ANXIETY. COMPARED TO CONTROLS, YOGA PARTICIPANTS REPORTED SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN CONFUSION AND INCREASES IN DISPOSITIONAL FLOW. YOGA PARTICIPANTS IN THE 2006 SAMPLE ALSO REPORTED SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THE MINDFULNESS SUBSCALE OF AWARENESS. CORRELATIONAL ANALYSES REVEALED THAT INCREASES IN PARTICIPANTS' DISPOSITIONAL FLOW AND MINDFULNESS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASES IN CONFUSION AND MUSIC PERFORMANCE ANXIETY. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THE COMMONALITIES BETWEEN POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY AND YOGA, BOTH OF WHICH ARE FOCUSED ON ENHANCING HUMAN PERFORMANCE AND PROMOTING BENEFICIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL STATES. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA AND MEDITATION MAY ENHANCE THE STATES OF FLOW AND MINDFUL AWARENESS, AND REDUCE CONFUSION.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
8 1505  36 IREST YOGA-NIDRA ON THE COLLEGE CAMPUS: CHANGES IN STRESS, DEPRESSION, WORRY, AND MINDFULNESS. OBJECTIVES: THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT YOGA PRACTICE IS ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED STRESS, WORRY, AND DEPRESSION, AND WITH IMPROVED MINDFULNESS-BASED SKILLS. THESE FINDINGS HAD NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY REPLICATED FOR A SAMPLE OF COLLEGE STUDENTS. THIS STUDY EVALUATED WHETHER IREST YOGA-NIDRA PRACTICE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED PERCEIVED STRESS, WORRY, AND DEPRESSION, AND INCREASED MINDFULNESS IN A SAMPLE OF COLLEGE STUDENT S. METHODS: SIXTY-SIX STUDENTS AGE 18-56 COMPLETED AN 8-WEEK IREST YOGA-NIDRA INTERVENTION THAT WAS OFFERED FOR 8 SEMESTERS. ASSESSMENT OCCURRED 1 WEEK PRIOR TO INTERVENTION ONSET AND DURING THE CLASS PERIOD FOLLOWING THE INTERVENTION. QUALITATIVE DATA WERE COLLECTED AT WEEKS 4 AND 8. RESULTS: STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT PRE- TO POSTTEST IMPROVEMENTS IN PERCEIVED STRESS, WORRY, AND DEPRESSION WERE FOUND. PRE-EXISTING DEPRESSION ACCOUNTED FOR MOST OF THE CHANGE IN WORRY AND PERCEIVED STRESS SCORES. PRE- TO POST TEST IMPROVEMENTS IN MINDFULNESS-BASED SKILLS WERE ALSO DETECTED. CONCLUSIONS: IREST YOGA-NIDRA PRACTICE MAY REDUCE SYMPTOMS OF PERCEIVED STRESS, WORRY, AND DEPRESSION AND INCREASE MINDFULNESS-BASED SKILLS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
9 1372  44 IMPACT OF A YOGA AND MEDITATION INTERVENTION ON STUDENTS' STRESS AND ANXIETY LEVELS. OBJECTIVE. TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF A SIX-WEEK YOGA AND MEDITATION INTERVENTION ON COLLEGE STUDENTS' STRESS PERCEPTION, ANXIETY LEVELS, AND MINDFULNESS SKILLS. METHODS. COLLEGE STUDENTS PARTICIPATED IN A SIX-WEEK PILOT PROGRAM THAT CONSISTED OF A 60-MINUTE VINYASA FLOW YOGA CLASS ONCE WEEKLY, FOLLOWED BY GUIDED MEDITATION DELIVERED BY TRAINED FACULTY MEMBERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND COLLEGE OF PHARMACY. STUDENTS COMPLETED PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION QUESTIONNAIRES TO EVALUATE CHANGES IN THE FOLLOWING OUTCOMES: STRESS LEVELS, ANXIETY LEVELS, AND MINDFULNESS SKILLS. THE QUESTIONNAIRE CONSISTED OF THREE SELF-REPORTING TOOLS: THE BECK ANXIETY INVENTORY (BAI), THE PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE (PSS), AND THE FIVE FACET MINDFULNESS QUESTIONNAIRE (FFMQ). STUDENTS' SCORES ON EACH WERE ASSESSED TO DETECT ANY CHANGES FROM BASELINE USING THE NUMERICAL AND CATEGORICAL SCALES (LOW, MEDIUM, AND HIGH) FOR EACH INSTRUMENT. RESULTS. SEVENTEEN PARTICIPANTS, AGED 19 TO 23 YEARS, COMPLETED THE STUDY. THIRTEEN PARTICIPANTS WERE FEMALE AND FOUR WERE MALE. NINE OF THE STUDENTS WERE ENROLLED IN THE DOCTOR OF PHARMACY PROGRAM AND EIGHT WERE ENROLLED IN OTHER ACADEMIC PROGRAMS. STUDENTS' ANXIETY AND STRESS SCORES DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY WHILE THEIR TOTAL MINDFULNESS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. CHANGES IN CATEGORICAL DATA FROM PRE- TO POST-INTERVENTION ON THE BAI AND PSS WERE SIGNIFICANT, WITH NO STUDENTS SCORING IN THE "HIGH" CATEGORY FOR STRESS OR ANXIETY ON THE POST-INTERVENTION QUESTIONNAIRE. CONCLUSION. STUDENTS EXPERIENCED A REDUCTION IN STRESS AND ANXIETY LEVELS AFTER COMPLETING A SIX-WEEK YOGA AND MEDITATION PROGRAM PRECEDING FINAL EXAMINATIONS. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ADOPTING A MINDFULNESS PRACTICE FOR AS LITTLE AS ONCE PER WEEK MAY REDUCE STRESS AND ANXIETY IN COLLEGE STUDENTS. ADMINISTRATORS SHOULD CONSIDER INCLUDING INSTRUCTION IN NONPHARMACOLOGIC STRESS AND ANXIETY REDUCTION METHODS, WITHIN CURRICULA IN ORDER TO SUPPORT STUDENT SELF-CARE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
10 2730  40 YOGA OF IMMORTALS INTERVENTION REDUCES SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION, INSOMNIA AND ANXIETY. BACKGROUND: DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND DISORDERED SLEEP ARE SOME COMMON SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH SUB-OPTIMAL MENTAL HEALTH. DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES HAVE GROWN INCREASINGLY MORE PREVALENT IN THE POPULATION. DUE TO SOCIAL DISTANCING AND OTHER LIMITATIONS DURING THE PANDEMIC, THERE IS A NEED FOR HOME-BASED, FLEXIBLE INTERVENTIONS THAT CAN IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH. THE YOGA OF IMMORTALS (YOI) MOBILE APPLICATION PROVIDES A STRUCTURED INTERVENTION THAT CAN BE USED ON ANY MOBILE DEVICE AND APPLIED FROM THE USER'S HOME. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 1,505 PARTICIPANTS WERE ENROLLED IN THE STUDY AND USED THE YOI APP FOR AN 8-WEEK PERIOD. PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO FILL OUT THREE QUESTIONNAIRES: THE PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE, 8 ITEMS (PHQ-8), THE GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER QUESTIONNAIRE (GAD-7) AND THE INSOMNIA SEVERITY INDEX (ISI). THESE THREE ITEMS WERE COMPLETED BY 1,297 PARTICIPANTS A TOTAL OF FOUR TIMES: BEFORE STARTING YOI, TWO MORE TIMES DURING USE, AND A FOURTH TIME AFTER THE 8-WEEK USAGE PERIOD. CHANGES IN PHQ8, GAD7 AND ISI IN PARTICIPANTS WERE COMPARED TO A CONTROL GROUP, WHO DID NOT USE THE YOI APP BUT COMPLETED ALL QUESTIONNAIRES (590 CONTROLS FINISHED ALL QUESTIONNAIRES). RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS REPORTED SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY-RELATED SYMPTOMS. COMPARED TO BASELINE, PHQ-8 SCORES DECREASED 50% ON AVERAGE AFTER THE 8-WEEK PERIOD. GAD-7 SCORES ALSO DECREASED BY 40-50% ON AVERAGE, AND ISI SCORES DECREASED BY 50%. THESE CHANGES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER (P < 0.05) THAN THAT OBSERVED IN THE CONTROL GROUP. PARTICIPANTS WHO REPORTED A PREVIOUS DIAGNOSIS OF DEPRESSION AND GENERALIZED ANXIETY REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER DECREASES IN PHQ-8 AND GAD-7 AS COMPARED TO PARTICIPANTS WITH NO PRIOR DIAGNOSIS (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: REGULAR USE OF THE YOI INTERVENTION OVER AN 8-WEEK PERIOD LED TO SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN SYMPTOMS OF BOTH DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, AS WELL AS ALLEVIATION OF INSOMNIA.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
11 1371  45 IMPACT OF A YIN YOGA AND MEDITATION INTERVENTION ON PHARMACY FACULTY AND STUDENT WELL-BEING. BACKGROUND: STUDENT PHARMACISTS AND FACULTY EXHIBIT HIGH LEVELS OF STRESS, INDEPENDENT OF THE CURRENT CORONAVIRUS 2019 PANDEMIC, AND THEIR PATH TOWARD WELLNESS, INCLUDING A REDUCTION IN STRESS AND ANXIETY, IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE. YOGA AND MEDITATION ARE PROVEN INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE STRESS AND ANXIETY AND INCREASE WELLNESS. YIN YOGA IS AN ADAPTABLE, QUIET PRACTICE IDEAL FOR THOSE LACKING PREVIOUS YOGA EXPERIENCE, FLEXIBILITY, AND TIME. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF A 6-WEEK YIN YOGA AND MEDITATION INTERVENTION ON COLLEGE OF PHARMACY FACULTY AND STUDENTS' STRESS PERCEPTION, ANXIETY LEVELS, AND MINDFULNESS SKILLS. METHODS: FACULTY AND STUDENTS PARTICIPATED IN A 6-WEEK PILOT PROGRAM COMPRISING A ONCE-WEEKLY YIN YOGA CLASS FOLLOWED BY GUIDED MEDITATION. YIN YOGA WAS SELECTED FOR ITS QUIET MEDITATIVE STYLE. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED A PRE- AND POSTQUESTIONNAIRE AT 6 WEEKS AND 3 AND 6 MONTHS TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN PERCEIVED STRESS SCORES, ANXIETY SCORES, AND MINDFULNESS SKILLS. THE QUESTIONNAIRE WAS COMPOSED OF 3 SELF-REPORTING TOOLS: BECK ANXIETY INVENTORY (BAI), PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE, AND THE FIVE FACET MINDFULNESS QUESTIONNAIRE. RESULTS: TWENTY PARTICIPANTS, 12 STUDENTS AND 8 FACULTY (AGES 18-66 YEARS), COMPLETED THE STUDY. ANXIETY AND STRESS SCORES DECREASED, AND MINDFULNESS INCREASED AT 6 WEEKS, 3 MONTHS AND 6 MONTHS, WITH ALL CHANGES REACHING STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. NO PARTICIPANTS REPORTED BEING IN THE "HIGH" CATEGORY OF ANXIETY AFTER INTERVENTION USING BAI CATEGORICAL DATA, ALTHOUGH THIS FINDING WAS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. CONCLUSION: FACULTY AND STUDENTS DEMONSTRATED A REDUCTION IN STRESS AND ANXIETY LEVELS AND AN INCREASE IN MINDFULNESS AFTER A 6-WEEK YIN YOGA AND MEDITATION PROGRAM. OUTCOMES SUGGEST THAT INCLUSION OF AN ADAPTABLE, MEDITATIVE PRACTICE, WHICH MAY EASILY BE REPLICATED AT HOME, FOR AS LITTLE AS ONCE PER WEEK FOR 6 WEEKS MAY REDUCE STRESS AND ANXIETY AND INCREASE MINDFULNESS LONG TERM. CREATING A CULTURE OF WELLNESS SHOULD BE A PRIORITY FOR ALL COLLEGES OF PHARMACY.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
12 2818  40 YOGA TRAINING IN JUNIOR PRIMARY SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN HAS AN IMPACT ON PHYSICAL SELF-PERCEPTIONS AND PROBLEM-RELATED BEHAVIOR. THE PRESENT PILOT STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA TRAINING, AS COMPARED TO PHYSICAL SKILL TRAINING, ON MOTOR AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION, PHYSICAL SELF-CONCEPT, AND ANXIETY-RELATED BEHAVIOR IN JUNIOR PRIMARY SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN. TWENTY-FOUR PARTICIPANTS WITH A MEAN AGE OF 8.4 (+/-1.4) YEARS COMPLETED EITHER YOGA OR PHYSICAL SKILL TRAINING TWICE A WEEK FOR 6 WEEKS OUTSIDE OF REGULAR SCHOOL CLASS TIME. BOTH FORMS OF TRAINING WERE DELIVERED IN AN INDIVIDUALIZED AND CHILD-ORIENTED MANNER. THE TYPE OF TRAINING DID NOT RESULT IN ANY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN MOVEMENT AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION OUTCOMES. IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL SELF-CONCEPT, SIGNIFICANT GROUP DIFFERENCES WERE REVEALED ONLY FOR PERCEIVED MOVEMENT SPEED SUCH THAT YOGA TRAINING RESULTED IN PERCEPTIONS OF BEING SLOWER WHILE PHYSICAL SKILL TRAINING RESULTED IN PERCEPTIONS OF MOVING FASTER. ANALYSIS OF ANXIETY RELATED OUTCOMES REVEALED SIGNIFICANT GROUP EFFECTS ONLY FOR AVOIDANCE BEHAVIOR AND COPING STRATEGIES. AVOIDANCE BEHAVIOR INCREASED FOLLOWING YOGA TRAINING, BUT DECREASED FOLLOWING PHYSICAL SKILL TRAINING. IN ADDITION, FOLLOWING YOGA TRAINING, CHILDREN SHOWED AN INCREASED USE OF DIVERGENT COPING STRATEGIES WHEN FACING PROBLEMATIC SITUATIONS WHILE AFTER PHYSICAL SKILL TRAINING CHILDREN DEMONSTRATED A DECREASE IN USE OF DIVERGENT COPING STRATEGIES. CHANGES IN OVERALL PHYSICAL SELF-CONCEPT SCORES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH CHANGES IN AVOIDANCE BEHAVIOR FOLLOWING YOGA TRAINING. IN CONTRAST, FOLLOWING PHYSICAL SKILL TRAINING INCREASED PHYSICAL SELF-CONCEPT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH DECREASES IN AVOIDANCE BEHAVIOR. IN SUM, EXPOSURE TO YOGA OR PHYSICAL SKILL TRAINING APPEARS TO RESULT IN DISTINCT EFFECTS FOR SPECIFIC DOMAINS OF PHYSICAL SELF-CONCEPT AND ANXIETY-RELATED BEHAVIOR. FURTHER STUDIES WITH LARGER SAMPLES AND MORE RIGOROUS METHODOLOGIES ARE REQUIRED TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS REPORTED HERE. WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE STUDIES, WE ADDRESS POTENTIAL RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND SPECIFIC FEATURES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN A SAMPLE OF SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
13  661  45 EFFECT OF 12 WEEKS OF YOGA TRAINING ON THE SOMATIZATION, PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS, AND STRESS-RELATED BIOMARKERS OF HEALTHY WOMEN. BACKGROUND: PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE PRACTICE OF YOGA REDUCES PERCEIVED STRESS AND NEGATIVE FEELINGS AND THAT IT IMPROVES PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS. OUR PREVIOUS STUDY ALSO SUGGESTED THAT LONG-TERM YOGA TRAINING IMPROVES STRESS-RELATED PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS SUCH AS ANXIETY AND ANGER. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA PRACTICE ON SOMATIZATION, THE MOST COMMON STRESS-RELATED PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS, AND STRESS-RELATED BIOMARKERS. WE PERFORMED A PROSPECTIVE, SINGLE ARM STUDY TO EXAMINE THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF 12 WEEKS OF YOGA TRAINING ON SOMATIZATION, PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS, AND STRESS-RELATED BIOMARKERS. METHODS: WE RECRUITED HEALTHY WOMEN WHO HAD NO EXPERIENCE WITH YOGA. THE DATA OF 24 PARTICIPANTS WHO WERE FOLLOWED DURING 12 WEEKS OF YOGA TRAINING WERE ANALYZED. SOMATIZATION AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS WERE ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER 12 WEEKS OF YOGA TRAINING USING THE PROFILE OF MOOD STATE (POMS) AND THE SYMPTOM CHECKLIST-90-REVISED (SCL-90-R) QUESTIONNAIRES. URINARY 8-HYDROXYDEOXYGUANOSINE (8-OHDG), BIOPYRRIN, AND CORTISOL LEVELS WERE MEASURED AS STRESS-RELATED BIOMARKERS. THE WILCOXON SIGNED-RANK TEST WAS USED TO COMPARE THE STRESS-RELATED BIOMARKERS AND THE SCORES OF QUESTIONNAIRES BEFORE AND AFTER 12 WEEKS OF YOGA TRAINING. RESULTS: AFTER 12 WEEKS OF YOGA TRAINING, ALL NEGATIVE SUBSCALE SCORES (TENSION-ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, ANGER-HOSTILITY, FATIGUE, AND CONFUSION) FROM THE POMS AND SOMATIZATION, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND HOSTILITY FROM THE SCL-90-R WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED COMPARED WITH THOSE BEFORE STARTING YOGA TRAINING. CONTRARY TO OUR EXPECTATION, THE URINARY 8-OHDG CONCENTRATION AFTER 12 WEEKS OF YOGA TRAINING SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE COMPARED WITH THAT BEFORE STARTING YOGA TRAINING. NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE OBSERVED IN THE LEVELS OF URINARY BIOPYRRIN AND CORTISOL AFTER THE 12 WEEKS OF YOGA TRAINING. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA TRAINING HAS THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE THE SOMATIZATION SCORE AND THE SCORES RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH INDICATORS, SUCH AS ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, ANGER, AND FATIGUE. THE PRESENT FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA CAN IMPROVE SOMATIZATION AND MENTAL HEALTH STATUS AND HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PREVENTION OF PSYCHOSOMATIC SYMPTOMS IN HEALTHY WOMEN.

14 1367  33 IMPACT OF A MINDFULNESS-BASED, WORKPLACE GROUP YOGA INTERVENTION ON BURNOUT, SELF-CARE, AND COMPASSION IN HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER A WORKPLACE, GROUP MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION COULD HELP MANAGE BURNOUT AND IMPROVE WELLBEING AMONG HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 43 HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS PARTICIPATED IN 8-WEEK SUPERVISED WORKPLACE, GROUP MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA ACTIVITIES. THE AUTHORS USED A SINGLE-SAMPLE, PRE-POST DESIGN. AT TWO POINTS IN TIME (BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION), PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED A SET OF ONLINE MEASURES ASSESSING BURNOUT, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, STRESS, RESILIENCE, AND COMPASSION. THE AUTHORS USED LINEAR MIXED MODEL ANALYSIS TO ASSESS CHANGES IN OUTCOME MEASURES. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS HAD IMPROVEMENTS AFTER THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION. AT POSTINTERVENTION, THEY HAD SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER SCORES ON PERSONAL ACCOMPLISHMENT, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, STRESS, PERCEIVED RESILIENCE, AND COMPASSION. PARTICIPANTS HAD A POSITIVE PERCEPTION OF THE YOGA INTERVENTION. CONCLUSION: GROUP MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA PROGRAM MAY BE CONVENIENT AND LOW-COST APPROACH TO SUPPORT HEALTH AND WELLBEING AMONG HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
15 2520  34 YOGA COMPLEMENTS COGNITIVE BEHAVIOUR THERAPY AS AN ADJUNCT TREATMENT FOR ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION: QUALITATIVE FINDINGS FROM A MIXED-METHODS STUDY. OBJECTIVES: COGNITIVE BEHAVIOUR THERAPY (CBT) IS RECOMMENDED FOR TREATING ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, DEMONSTRATING GOOD EFFICACY AND MODERATE RATES OF ENGAGEMENT. TO FURTHER IMPROVE OUTCOMES AND ACCESS TO EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENTS, RESEARCHERS HAVE SOUGHT TO ENHANCE CBT PROTOCOLS WITH MINDFULNESS-BASED APPROACHES, SUCH AS YOGA. THIS STUDY AIMED TO EXAMINE WHETHER YOGA IS AN ACCEPTABLE AND COMPLEMENTARY ADJUNCT TO CBT THROUGH EXPLORING THE LIVED EXPERIENCES OF ADULTS WITH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION WHO ENGAGED IN AN ADJUNCT THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAMME ALONGSIDE GROUP CBT. DESIGN: SINGLE-GROUP QUALITATIVE DESIGN WITH POST-INTERVENTION AND FOLLOW-UP TIMEPOINTS. METHODS: THIRTY-SIX ADULTS WITH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SELF-SELECTED INTO A THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAMME AS AN ADJUNCT TO GROUP CBT. QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH 27 PARTICIPANTS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE EIGHT-WEEK PROGRAMME AND AGAIN THREE MONTHS LATER. THEMATIC ANALYSIS WAS USED TO IDENTIFY COMMON THEMES FROM THE LIVED EXPERIENCES. RESULTS: THREE PRIMARY THEMES, WITH NINE SUBTHEMES, WERE IDENTIFIED WHICH REFLECT THE EXPERIENCES OF THE COMBINED THERAPIES, THE COMPLEMENTARY ELEMENTS, AND PROCESS OF ENGAGEMENT OVER TIME. THE ADJUNCT YOGA PROGRAMME WAS HIGHLY ACCEPTABLE TO ADULTS WITH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, ENHANCING ENGAGEMENT AND PERCEIVED OUTCOMES. YOGA WAS IDENTIFIED AS PROVIDING A UNIQUE COMBINATION OF ELEMENTS THAT COMPLEMENTED PROCESSES OF CBT, SUCH AS BEHAVIOURAL ACTIVATION AND THOUGHT DISPUTATION. YOGA PRACTICES REPRESENTED MENTAL HEALTH SELF-MANAGEMENT TOOLS THAT ARE ACCESSIBLE AND AVAILABLE AS RELAPSE PREVENTION STRATEGIES. CONCLUSIONS: THERAPEUTIC YOGA WARRANTS CONSIDERATION AS AN ADJUNCT TREATMENT FOR ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AS IT OFFERS UNIQUE AND COMPLEMENTARY ELEMENTS TO CBT AND CAN ENHANCE ENGAGEMENT AND PERCEIVED CLINICAL OUTCOMES. PRACTITIONER POINTS: ADULTS WITH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION EXPERIENCED A THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAMME AS A SUITABLE AND APPEALING ADJUNCT THAT ENHANCED ENGAGEMENT WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENT. YOGA OFFERS A UNIQUE COMBINATION OF ELEMENTS, INCLUDING A VALUES SYSTEM, BODY-BASED MINDFULNESS PRACTICES, AND BREATHING TECHNIQUES, THAT COMPLEMENT CBT PROCESSES, SUCH AS BEHAVIOURAL ACTIVATION, AWARENESS OF MALADAPTIVE PATTERNS, AND THOUGHT DISPUTATION. A THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAMME PROVIDES ADULTS WITH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION WITH AN ACCESSIBLE AND SUSTAINABLE MENTAL HEALTH SELF-MANAGEMENT TOOL. THERAPEUTIC YOGA CAN BE CONSIDERED FOR INTEGRATION TO MODELS OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE PROVISION TO ENHANCE ENGAGEMENT AND CLINICAL OUTCOMES FOR ADULTS WITH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION.	2021	

16 1428  57 IMPROVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING FOLLOWING A BRIEF YOGA-BASED PROGRAM FOR EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS WHO ATTENDED A YOGA-BASED PROGRAM. METHODS: EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS WHO ATTENDED A 3-DAY YOGA-BASED RISE (RESILIENCE, INTEGRATION, SELF-AWARENESS, ENGAGEMENT) PROGRAM WERE RECRUITED TO PARTICIPATE. RISE WAS ADMINISTERED AT THE KRIPALU CENTER FOR YOGA & HEALTH. MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING, AND HEALTH-RELATED BEHAVIORS WERE COMPLETED BEFORE (BASELINE), AFTER (POST), AND 2 MONTHS AFTER RISE (FOLLOW-UP). FORTY-FOUR PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED BASELINE AND POST AND WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. OF THOSE, 33 PARTICIPANTS ALSO COMPLETED THE FOLLOW-UP. PAIRED SAMPLES T TESTS WERE USED TO COMPARE SCORES BETWEEN TIME POINTS. RESULTS: COMPARED TO BASELINE, AT POST, PARTICIPANTS SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS IN PERCEIVED STRESS, MINDFULNESS, EMPOWERMENT, POSITIVE AFFECT, NEGATIVE AFFECT, SELF-COMPASSION, TOTAL WORK ENGAGEMENT, VIGOR, SLEEP QUALITY (ALL P VALUES < .001), RESILIENCE, SATISFACTION WITH LIFE, AS WELL AS EXHAUSTION AND PROFESSIONAL EFFICACY WHICH ARE DIMENSIONS OF BURNOUT (ALL P VALUES < .01). AT THE FOLLOW-UP, SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE MAINTAINED FOR MINDFULNESS, EMPOWERMENT, SELF-COMPASSION, SLEEP QUALITY (ALL P VALUES < .001), RESILIENCE, VIGOR, AND EXHAUSTION (ALL P VALUES < .01) AND POSITIVE AFFECT, SATISFACTION WITH LIFE, AND WORK ENGAGEMENT (ALL P VALUES < .05). CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE YOGA-BASED RISE PROGRAM IMPROVES PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS. IN ADDITION, PARTICIPANTS REPORTED THAT ATTENDING RISE WAS FEASIBLE, THEY COULD CONTINUE USING RISE PRACTICES LONG-TERM, SHARED THEM WITH WORK COLLEAGUES, AND REPORTED THAT RISE POSITIVELY IMPACTED BOTH THEIR DAILY LIVES AND WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT. WITH THESE PROMISING RESULTS, ADDITIONAL CONTROLLED RESEARCH IS WARRANTED.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
17 1718  38 PERCEIVED STRESS, RESILIENCE, WELL-BEING, AND COVID 19 RESPONSE IN ISHA YOGA PRACTITIONERS COMPARED TO MATCHED CONTROLS: A RESEARCH PROTOCOL. OBJECTIVES: THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT STRESSOR WORLDWIDE AND REPORTS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, DEPRESSION, SEDENTARY LIFESTYLES, AND OVERALL DECREASED WELLBEING ARE INCREASING. YOGA PRACTICES HAVE BEEN FOUND TO IMPROVE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH. THE PURPOSE OF THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IS TO COMPARE ISHA YOGA PRACTITIONERS TO CONTROLS ON PERCEIVED STRESS, RESILIENCE, WELLBEING, AND PROTECTION AND RECOVERY FROM COVID-19. TRIAL DESIGN. IN THIS PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL, THE EFFECTS OF YOGA PRACTICES ARE BEING COMPARED BETWEEN SEASONED YOGA PRACTITIONERS WITH TWO CONTROLS WHO ARE AGE (+/-3 YEARS), GENDER MATCHED, AND LIVING IN THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WILL BE ASKED TO COMPLETE A SERIES OF WEB-BASED SURVEYS AT BASELINE, SIX WEEKS, AND 12 WEEKS. THESE SURVEYS INCLUDE VALIDATED SCALES AND OBJECTIVE QUESTIONS ON COVID-19 INFECTION AND MEDICAL HISTORY. THE VALIDATED QUESTIONNAIRES ASSESS STRESS, MOOD STATES, RESILIENCE, AND OVERALL WELLBEING. QUESTIONNAIRES, WEEKLY ACTIVITY DIARIES, AND MEDICAL HISTORY, WILL BE COLLECTED USING REDCAP. RESULTS: WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT ROUTINE YOGA PRACTICE DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC WILL REDUCE STRESS, ENHANCE WELL-BEING, AND PROVIDE PROTECTIVE EFFECTS AGAINST COVID-19. CONCLUSION: WITH THE GROWING CONCERN ABOUT THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL IMPACTS OF COVID-19 AND INCREASED INTEREST IN ALTERNATIVE PRACTICES SUCH AS YOGIC PRACTICES, THIS STUDY WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE ABOUT THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR EMOTIONAL, MENTAL, AND PHYSICAL HEALTH CONDITIONS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
18  133  44 A PRAGMATIC PREFERENCE TRIAL OF THERAPEUTIC YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT TO GROUP COGNITIVE BEHAVIOUR THERAPY VERSUS GROUP CBT ALONE FOR DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY. BACKGROUND: YOGA HAS SEVERAL MECHANISMS THAT MAKE IT A PROMISING TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, INCLUDING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, BEHAVIOURAL ACTIVATION, AND MINDFULNESS. FOLLOWING POSITIVE OUTCOMES FROM ADAPTED CBT INTERVENTIONS INCORPORATING MINDFULNESS-BASED PRACTICES, THIS STUDY EXPLORED THE EFFECTS OF A THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM AS AN ADJUNCT TO GROUP-BASED CBT FOR DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY. METHODS: THIS WAS A PRAGMATIC PREFERENCE TRIAL INVOLVING ADULTS DIAGNOSED WITH DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY IN A REGIONAL PRIMARY MENTAL HEALTHCARE SERVICE (N = 59), COMPARING TRANSDIAGNOSTIC GROUP CBT (N = 27) WITH TRANSDIAGNOSTIC GROUP CBT COMBINED WITH AN ADJUNCT THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM (N = 32). A PREFERENCE RECRUITMENT DESIGN ALLOWED ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS (N = 35) TO SELF-SELECT INTO THE ADJUNCT PROGRAM. THE DEPRESSION ANXIETY STRESS SCALE-21 (DASS) WAS ASSESSED AT BASELINE, POST-INTERVENTION, AND THREE-MONTHS FOLLOW UP. RESULTS: CBT + YOGA WAS AN ACCEPTABLE ALTERNATIVE TO CBT ALONE. SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS WERE OBSERVED IN TOTAL DASS SCORES AND THE 3 SUBSCALES OF THE DASS FOR BOTH GROUPS, HOWEVER CBT + YOGA SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER DEPRESSIVE AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS POST-INTERVENTION, COMPARED TO CBT ALONE. CBT + YOGA ALSO SHOWED SUSTAINED REDUCTIONS IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS OVER THREE-MONTHS, AND MORE RAPID REDUCTIONS IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, COMPARED TO CBT ALONE. LIMITATIONS: THESE FINDINGS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED PRELIMINARY DUE TO THE MODERATE SAMPLE SIZE, WITH A RIGOROUS RANDOMISED CONTROL TRIAL NECESSARY TO DEFINITIVELY SUPPORT THE INTEGRATION OF YOGA WITHIN MENTAL HEALTH CARE TO AUGMENT THE BENEFITS AND UPTAKE OF TRANSDIAGNOSTIC CBT FOR DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY. CONCLUSIONS: COMPLEMENTING OTHER MINDFULNESS-BASED PRACTICES, THERAPEUTIC YOGA SHOWS PROMISE AS AN ADJUNCT TO TRANSDIAGNOSTIC CBT.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
19  634  34 DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN PERCEPTIONS OF REAL AND IDEAL YOGA TEACHERS AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING. OBJECTIVES: ALTHOUGH MORE INDIVIDUALS ARE ADOPTING YOGA INTO THEIR LIVES, LITTLE RESEARCH HAS EXAMINED PRACTITIONERS' EXPECTATIONS AND EXPERIENCES OF THEIR YOGA INSTRUCTOR'S BEHAVIOR. DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN REAL AND IDEAL BEHAVIORS OF YOGA INSTRUCTORS MAY LEAD TO UNSATISFACTORY EXPERIENCES AND DECREASE THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF YOGA PRACTICE. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED DIFFERENCES BETWEEN YOGA PRACTITIONERS' REAL AND IDEAL PERCEPTIONS OF THEIR YOGA TEACHER'S BEHAVIOR AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DISCREPANT BELIEFS AND STUDENTS' SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION, ANXIETY,AND STRESS. METHODS: THE PERCEPTIONS OF YOGA TEACHER QUESTIONNAIRE (PYTQ), A RECENTLY DEVELOPED SURVEY OF STUDENT ATTITUDES REGARDING YOGA TEACHERS' BEHAVIOR, WAS ADMINISTERED INA NATIONAL ONLINE SURVEY OF YOGA STUDENTS AND TEACHERS. GREATER DISCREPANCY BETWEEN REAL AND IDEA YOGA TEACHER BEHAVIOR WAS ANTICIPATED TO BE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH PRACTITIONERS' SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND STRESS. RESULTS: PEARSON CORRELATIONS CORRECTED FOR MULTIPLE COMPARISONS REVEALED THAT YOGA STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ARE GENERALLY SATISFIED WITH THEIR TEACHER'S BEHAVIORS. SIGNIFICANT DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN REAL AND IDEAL TEACHER BEHAVIOR WERE FOUND FOR BOTH GROUPS. HIGHER DISCREPANCY SCORES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH SYMPTOMS OF STRESS AND ANXIETY BUT NOT DEPRESSION FOR STUDENTS, BUT NOT FOR TEACHERS. CONCLUSIONS: THESE PRELIMINARY FINDINGS PROVIDE INSIGHT INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EXPECTANCIES AND REAL YOGA TEACHER BEHAVIORS AND THEIR LINKS TO STUDENT EMOTIONAL ADJUSTMENT.MORE RESEARCH IN THIS AREA IS WARRANTED.	2013

BACKGROUND: YOGA PRACTICE HAS BEEN EFFECTIVELY PRESCRIBED IN CONJUNCTION WITH OTHER MEDICAL AND YOGIC PROCEDURES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SEVERE PSYCHOSOMATIC DISEASES, INCLUDING CANCER, BRONCHIAL ASTHMA, COLITIS, PEPTIC AND ULCER. IT IMPROVES STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY, AND MAY HELP CONTROL PHYSIOLOGICAL VARIABLES SUCH AS BLOOD PRESSURE, LIPIDS, RESPIRATION, HEART RATE, AND METABOLIC RATE TO IMPROVE OVERALL EXERCISE CAPACITY. AIM OF THE STUDY: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGIC PRACTICE ON ANXIETY/DEPRESSION ASSOCIATED WITH OBESITY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PATIENTS WERE RECRUITED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSIOLOGY, C.S.M. MEDICAL UNIVERSITY (ERSTWHILE KGMU), LUCKNOW, UTTAR PRADESH, INDIA. A TOTAL OF 272 SUBJECTS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: 1) GROUP OF 205 SUBJECTS (WITH YOGIC PRACTICE) AND 2) A CONTROL GROUP OF 67 SUBJECTS (WITH AEROBIC EXERCISE). ASSESSMENT OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION WERE DONE BY HAMILTON RATING SCALE. RESULT: THIS STUDY SUPPORTS YOGA AS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL WITH NO DIET RESTRICTION TO IMPROVE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AS WELL AS OBESITY IN OBESE SUBJECTS CONCLUSION: INCORPORATING YOGIC ASANA IN THE TREATMENT PROTOCOL OF PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION MAY PROVE BENEFICIAL IN THE LONG RUN.	2013

1 2013 157 SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA: A BREATH OF HOPE DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC. IMPORTANT COUNTER MEASURES TO COMBAT AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE PANDEMIC INCLUDE VACCINATION, ANTIVIRAL THERAPY, AND IMMUNOMODULATION THERAPY. VACCINATIONS ARE DISEASE SPECIFIC AND MOREOVER STRAIN SPECIFIC, SO THE PROTECTION PROVIDED IS ALSO SPECIFIC AND LIMITED. ANTIVIRAL THERAPIES ARE COSTLY AND REQUIRE BULK PRODUCTION OF DRUGS, HENCE GLOBALLY THERE IS AN INCREASED INTEREST TOWARD LOW-RISK, COST-EFFECTIVE COMPLEMENTARY ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, SUCH AS YOGA AND AYURVEDA TO TACKLE THE INFECTIOUS PANDEMIC, CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19). THERE IS CLINICAL EVIDENCE AVAILABLE ON THE POTENTIAL COMPLEMENTARY ROLE OF YOGIC PRACTICES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF NONCOMMUNICABLE AND COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. VARIOUS ONLINE DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR ARTICLES PUBLISHED BETWEEN 2000 AND 2020. DATABASES EXPLORED WERE MEDLINE, EMBASE, INDIAN CITATION INDEX, PSYCINFO, INDEX MEDICUS FOR SOUTH-EAST ASIA REGION, AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR. ALL SEARCH RESULTS WERE SCREENED, AND ARTICLES RELATED TO KEYWORDS SUCH AS COVID-19, YOGA THERAPY, AND SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA (SKY) WERE SELECTED FOR DATA EXTRACTION. QUALITY OF THE STUDIES INCLUDED WAS EVALUATED ON THE BASIS OF THE CONSTRUCT VALIDITY, CONTENT VALIDITY, RELEVANCE, BIAS, CREDIBILITY RELATING TO INFORMATION, AND DATA SOURCES. SKY IS A UNIQUE YOGIC PRACTICE THAT INCLUDES SPECIFIC SEQUENTIAL BREATHING TECHNIQUES. IT BALANCES THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THUS CAN ALLEVIATE ANXIETY, ROUTINE STRESS, DEPRESSION, STRESS-RELATED MEDICAL DISORDERS, AND POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS. IT POTENTIATES NATURAL HOST IMMUNE DEFENSES THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO TACKLE A PLETHORA OF MICROBIAL INFECTIONS. THIS NARRATIVE REVIEW ARTICLE PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS THAT SKY CAN OFFER TO THE POPULATION AT LARGE DURING THIS COVID-19 PANDEMIC.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
2  100  34 A PERSPECTIVE ON YOGA AS A PREVENTIVE STRATEGY FOR CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019. THE PANDEMIC OUTBREAK OF CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) INFECTION CAUSED BY SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME-CORONAVIRUS 2 HAS LED TO PROFOUND PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. IN PARTICULAR, INDIVIDUALS WITH PREEXISTING CONDITIONS OF HEART DISEASE, DIABETES, CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES AND THE ELDERLY ARE MOST VULNERABLE TO SUCCUMB TO THIS INFECTION. THE CURRENT COVID-19 EMERGENCY CALLS FOR RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF POTENTIAL PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AGAINST THIS VIRUS-MEDIATED DISEASE. THERE IS A PLETHORA OF EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTS THE ADD-ON BENEFITS OF YOGA IN STRESS MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES. THERE ARE SOME STUDIES ON THE EFFECT OF YOGA IN COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AS WELL BUT VERY FEW FOR ACUTE CONDITIONS AND ALMOST NONE FOR THE RAPIDLY SPREADING INFECTIONS RESULTING IN PANDEMICS. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCES ON YOGA IN IMPROVING RESPIRATORY AND IMMUNE FUNCTIONS, WE HAVE FORMULATED VERY SIMPLE DOABLE INTEGRATED YOGA MODULES IN THE FORM OF VIDEOS TO BE PRACTICED FOR PREVENTION OF THE DISEASE BY CHILDREN, ADULTS, AND THE ELDERLY.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
3  906  36 EFFECTIVENESS OF APP-BASED YOGA OF IMMORTALS (YOI) INTERVENTION FOR INSOMNIA IN ASIAN POPULATION DURING PANDEMIC RESTRICTIONS. THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) PANDEMIC CREATED SIGNIFICANT PSYCHOLOGICAL CHALLENGES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING STRESS, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, AND INSOMNIA. IN ADDITION, SOCIAL DISTANCING, TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS, AND SPREAD OF DISEASE HAVE RESULTED IN UNIQUE CHALLENGES, CREATING BARRIERS TO HEALTHCARE ACCESS. COMPARED TO THE RATE PRIOR TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CLINICAL INSOMNIA RATES HAVE BEEN REPORTED. WITH WELL-KNOWN LIMITATIONS OF CURRENTLY ESTABLISHED TREATMENTS (E.G., COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY-INSOMNIA (CBT-I), PHARMACOTHERAPY), THERE IS A NEED TO EXPLORE OTHER EFFECTIVE AND SAFE TREATMENT MODALITIES TO TREAT INSOMNIA, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT CAN BE USED REMOTELY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF APP-BASED INTERVENTION TO TREAT INSOMNIA IN THE CURRENT ERA OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC (USING THE YOGA OF IMMORTALS (YOI) APP). THIS PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY WAS APPROVED BY THE INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD. ALL PARTICIPANTS IN THIS STUDY WERE ASKED TO COMPLETE AN ONLINE SURVEY INCLUDING DEMOGRAPHIC DATA AND VALIDATED INSOMNIA SEVERITY INDEX (ISI) AT BASELINE (15 MAY 2020), 4 WEEKS, AND 8 WEEKS AFTER STARTING THE YOI INTERVENTION. SURVEY DATA WAS EXPORTED USING MICROSOFT EXCEL. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS DONE USING THE GRAPHPAD PRISM 8. YOI INTERVENTION SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED THE MEAN ISI SCORES IN ALL CATEGORIES OF INSOMNIA (SEVERE, MODERATE, AND SUBTHRESHOLD) AT EACH FOLLOW-UP (P </= 0.0001). THE IMPROVEMENT WAS SIGNIFICANT AMONG ALL AGE GROUPS AND IN BOTH GENDERS. IN OUR STUDY, YOI WAS A NOVEL AND EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR IMPROVING INSOMNIA SYMPTOMS AND MAY BE A NEW ADDITION TO THE ARMAMENTARIUM OF INSOMNIA MANAGEMENT. BEING APP-BASED, THIS HAS POTENTIAL WIDER APPLICABILITY, ESPECIALLY DURING THE CURRENT COVID-19 PANDEMIC.	2021

5 1911  35 ROLE OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE IN THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC - A NARRATIVE REVIEW. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS POSED AN IMMENSE CHALLENGE TO HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AROUND THE GLOBE IN TERMS OF LIMITED HEALTH CARE FACILITIES AND PROVEN MEDICAL THERAPEUTICS TO ADDRESS THE SYMPTOMS OF THE INFECTION. THE CURRENT HEALTH CARE STRATEGIES ARE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON EITHER THE PATHOGEN OR THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. HOWEVER, EFFORTS TOWARDS STRENGTHENING THE HOST IMMUNITY ARE IMPORTANT FROM PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF INFECTION AND DOWNREGULATE THE POTENCY OF THE INFECTIOUS AGENT. WHILE A VACCINE CAN INDUCE SPECIFIC IMMUNITY IN THE HOST, NON-SPECIFIC WAYS OF IMPROVING OVERALL HOST IMMUNITY ARE NEEDED AS WELL. THIS SCENARIO HAS PAVED THE WAY FOR THE USE OF TRADITIONAL INDIAN THERAPIES SUCH AS AYURVEDA AND YOGA. THIS REVIEW AIMS AT COLLATING AVAILABLE EVIDENCE ON AYURVEDA, YOGA, AND COVID-19. FURTHER, IT DRAWS INFERENCES FROM RECENT STUDIES ON YOGA AND AYURVEDA ON IMMUNITY, RESPIRATORY HEALTH, AND MENTAL HEALTH RESPECTIVELY TO APPROXIMATE ITS PROBABLE ROLE IN PROPHYLAXIS AND AS AN ADD-ON MANAGEMENT OPTION FOR THE CURRENT PANDEMIC.	2022

7 2417  33 YOGA AND MEDITATION, AN ESSENTIAL TOOL TO ALLEVIATE STRESS AND ENHANCE IMMUNITY TO EMERGING INFECTIONS: A PERSPECTIVE ON THE EFFECT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON STUDENTS. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC CAUSED BY THE SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS-2 (SARS-COV-2) HAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE GLOBAL HEALTHCARE AND ECONOMIC SYSTEMS WORLDWIDE. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS ALSO CREATED AN EMOTIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PANDEMIC AMONG PEOPLE OF ALL AGES IRRESPECTIVE OF ECONOMIC STATUS AND PHYSICAL WELLBEING. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF PROLONGED LOCKDOWNS, ONE OF THE MOST SEVERELY AFFECTED AGE GROUPS GLOBALLY IS THE YOUNG ADULTS' GROUP, ESPECIALLY STUDENTS. UNCERTAINTIES IN THE ACADEMIC CALENDAR, RESTRICTED OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES, AND UNUSUAL DAILY ROUTINES DURING LOCKDOWNS LED TO HIGHER INCIDENCES OF STRESS, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION AMONG STUDENTS WORLDWIDE. IN THIS REVIEW, WE SUMMARISE THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECT OF LOCKDOWNS ON STUDENTS AND DISCUSS POSSIBLE POSITIVE IMPACTS OF YOGA AND MEDITATION ON VARIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL, EMOTIONAL, AND IMMUNOLOGICAL PARAMETERS, WHICH CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE THE GENERAL WELLBEING AND ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF STUDENTS. PERSPECTIVES SHARED IN THE REVIEW WILL ALSO BRING AWARENESS ON HOW YOGA AND MEDITATION COULD BOOST STUDENTS' PERFORMANCE AND ASSIST THEM IN MAINTAINING PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WELLBEING DURING STRESSFUL CONDITIONS SUCH AS FUTURE EPIDEMICS AND PANDEMICS WITH NOVEL INFECTIONS. THIS INFORMATION COULD HELP CREATE BETTER EDUCATIONAL CURRICULUMS AND HEALTHY ROUTINES FOR STUDENTS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
8 2275  47 THE ROLE OF YOGA IN WORKING FROM HOME DURING THE COVID-19 GLOBAL LOCKDOWN. BACKGROUND: THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS BECOME A MAJOR CAUSE OF STRESS AND ANXIETY WORLDWIDE. DUE TO THE GLOBAL LOCKDOWN, WORK, EMPLOYMENT, BUSINESSES AND THE ECONOMIC CLIMATE HAVE BEEN SEVERELY AFFECTED. IT HAS GENERATED STRESS AMONG PEOPLE FROM ALL SECTIONS OF SOCIETY, ESPECIALLY TO WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED TO CATER TO HEALTHCARE SERVICE OR THOSE CONSTRAINED TO SECURE DAILY ESSENTIAL ITEMS. IT IS WIDELY PERCEIVED THAT ELDERLY OR THOSE AFFECTED BY DIABETES, HYPERTENSION AND OTHER CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES ARE PRONE TO COVID-19. AS PER AN ONGOING SURVEY, THE INITIAL DATA SHOWS THAT THE ABOVE-MENTIONED ANXIETY AND STRESS CAUSE INSOMNIA, AND HAS THE CONSIDERABLE POTENTIAL TO WEAKEN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM, THE SOLE PROTECTION AGAINST THE VIRUS. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON THE NEED OF YOGA PRACTICE AT WORK PLACES AND AT HOME DURING THE GLOBAL LOCKDOWN DUE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. METHODS: LITERATURE WAS SEARCHED USING PUBMED AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR FOR COVID-19-RELATED STRESS AND ANXIETY AT WORK AND SOCIETY DUE TO THE WORLDWIDE LOCKDOWN. THE PREDISPOSING COMORBIDITIES, VIRAL MECHANISM OF ACTION AND TREATMENT REGIMEN WERE ALSO SEARCHED. YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION STUDIES AND ONLINE PROGRAMS WERE ALSO SEARCHED. RESULTS: AS THE LOCKDOWN CANNOT LAST FOREVER AND WORKPLACES WILL HAVE TO BE FUNCTIONAL SOON, THERE IS AN INCREASED POSSIBILITY OF RECURRENT INFECTION. THEREFORE, YOGA CAN PROVIDE THE NECESSARY TOOL FOR RISK REDUCTION, AMELIORATION OF STRESS AND ANXIETY AND STRENGTHENING OF THE IMMUNE FUNCTION. THE ONLINE PLATFORMS PROVIDE A GOOD MEDIA FOR YOGA TRAINING AT WORK PLACES AND HOMES. CONCLUSION: DUE TO SOCIAL DISTANCING NORMS, THE AVAILABILITY OF YOGA TRAINERS HAS BECOME RESTRICTED. YOGA PRACTICE IS ACTIVELY SOUGHT TO ACHIEVE REDUCED ANXIETY AND STRESS SO THAT IMPROVED SLEEP MAY POSITIVELY IMPACT IMMUNITY. AS A CONSEQUENCE, THERE IS A SPURT IN SOCIAL MEDIA, CATERING TO DAILY ONLINE YOGA SESSIONS WHICH APPARENTLY PROVE USEFUL IN PROVIDING ACCESSIBLE MEANS TO ACHIEVE MENTAL AS WELL AS PHYSICAL WELL-BEING.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
9 2283  28 THE USE OF INTEGRATIVE THERAPY BASED ON YOGA AND AYURVEDA IN THE TREATMENT OF A HIGH-RISK CASE OF COVID-19/SARS-COV-2 WITH MULTIPLE COMORBIDITIES: A CASE REPORT. BACKGROUND: WE REPORT A HIGH-RISK CASE OF A CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 19 (COVID-19)-POSITIVE PATIENT WITH COMORBIDITIES INCLUDING DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), HYPERTENSION (HTN), HYPOTHYROIDISM AND CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (CKD), TREATED SUCCESSFULLY USING AN INTEGRATIVE THERAPY PLAN BASED ON AYURVEDA AND YOGA, ALONG WITH GOVERNMENT-MANDATED COMPULSORY MODERN WESTERN MEDICINE (MWM) TREATMENT. RECENTLY, SOME EVIDENCE HAS BEEN EMERGING ON THE USE OF AYURVEDA FOR TREATMENT OF COVID-19. THE CLASSICAL TEXTS OF AYURVEDIC MEDICINE SUCH AS CHARAKA SAMHITA AND SUSHRUTA SAMHITA CONTAIN DESCRIPTIONS OF PANDEMICS OF SIMILAR PROPORTIONS AND DESCRIBE THEM AS JANAPADODDHVANSA, MEANING THE DESTRUCTION OF COMMUNITIES, ALONG WITH THEIR CAUSES AND TREATMENT. CASE PRESENTATION: THE CASE REPORTED HEREIN IS A 55-YEAR-OLD MAN FROM DELHI, INDIA, WITH CONFIRMED (TESTED) COVID-19, WHO FIRST TOOK MWM FOR 7 DAYS BEFORE SEEKING INTEGRATIVE THERAPY. THE PATIENT HAS COMORBIDITIES INCLUDING DM, HTN, HYPOTHYROIDISM AND CKD AND HAD DEVELOPED SYMPTOMS INCLUDING FEVER (WHICH WAS RESOLVED BY THE TIME INTEGRATIVE THERAPY WAS STARTED), SORE THROAT, DRY COUGH, BODY ACHES, WEAKNESS, BAD TASTE AND SMELL, AND HEAVINESS IN THE ABDOMEN. BASED ON THE PATIENT'S SYMPTOMS AND COMORBIDITIES, A TREATMENT PLAN INCLUDING AYURVEDIC MEDICINES, YOGA PROTOCOL, DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS AND LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS WAS PRESCRIBED BY A REGISTERED AYURVEDA DOCTOR AND A YOGA CONSULTANT. THE PATIENT STARTED EXPERIENCING IMPROVEMENT IN ALL THE SYMPTOMS WITHIN 2 DAYS AFTER STARTING THE TREATMENT; HE REPORTED APPROXIMATELY [FORMULA: SEE TEXT] RELIEF FROM THE SYMPTOMS AFTER 5 DAYS, AND ALMOST COMPLETE RELIEF WITHIN 9 DAYS. ALSO, THE BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS (BOTH FASTING BLOOD SUGAR [FBS] AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD SUGAR [PPBS]) EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT AFTER 5 DAYS, AND DECREASED TO WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE WITHIN 12 DAYS. BESIDES RELIEF IN SYMPTOMS, THE PATIENT'S REAL-TIME REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (RT-PCR) TEST DONE ON THE 19TH DAY RETURNED NEGATIVE RESULTS. CONCLUSIONS: INTEGRATIVE THERAPY WAS FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE IN MITIGATING THE SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19 IN THIS PATIENT WITH MULTIPLE COMORBIDITIES. MOREOVER, A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS (NOT UNDER CONTROL WITH MODERN MEDICINE) WAS ALSO ACHIEVED. INTEGRATIVE THERAPY BASED ON THE CLASSICAL TEXTS OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA MAY OFFER A PROMISING AND SCALABLE TREATMENT OPTION FOR COVID-19 PATIENTS. A CASE SERIES OR A SUITABLY DESIGNED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IS NEEDED TO ASSESS ITS EFFICACY.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
10 2753  33 YOGA PRACTICE IS BENEFICIAL FOR MAINTAINING HEALTHY LIFESTYLE AND ENDURANCE UNDER RESTRICTIONS AND STRESS IMPOSED BY LOCKDOWN DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC. UNCERTAINTY ABOUT CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) AND RESULTING LOCKDOWN CAUSED WIDESPREAD PANIC, STRESS, AND ANXIETY. YOGA IS A KNOWN PRACTICE THAT REDUCES STRESS AND ANXIETY AND MAY ENHANCE IMMUNITY. THIS STUDY AIMED TO (1) INVESTIGATE THAT INCLUDING YOGA IN DAILY ROUTINE IS BENEFICIAL FOR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH, AND (2) TO EVALUATE LIFESTYLE OF YOGA PRACTITIONERS THAT MAY BE INSTRUMENTAL IN COPING WITH STRESS ASSOCIATED WITH LOCKDOWN. THIS IS A PAN-INDIA CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY STUDY, WHICH WAS CONDUCTED DURING THE LOCKDOWN. A SELF-RATED SCALE, COVID HEALTH ASSESSMENT SCALE (CHAS), WAS DESIGNED BY 11 EXPERTS IN 3 DELPHI ROUNDS (CONTENT VALID RATIO = 0.85) TO EVALUATE THE PHYSICAL HEALTH, MENTAL HEALTH, LIFESTYLE, AND COPING SKILLS OF THE INDIVIDUALS. THE SURVEY WAS MADE AVAILABLE DIGITALLY USING GOOGLE FORMS AND COLLECTED 23,760 CHAS RESPONSES. THERE WERE 23,290 VALID RESPONSES (98%). AFTER THE STUDY'S INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA OF YOGIC PRACTICES, THE RESPONDENTS WERE CATEGORIZED INTO THE YOGA (N = 9,840) AND NON-YOGA (N = 3,377) GROUPS, WHO ACTIVELY PRACTICED YOGA DURING THE LOCKDOWN IN INDIA. THE STATISTICAL ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED RUNNING LOGISTIC AND MULTINOMIAL REGRESSION AND CALCULATING ODDS RATIO ESTIMATION USING R SOFTWARE VERSION 4.0.0. THE NON-YOGA GROUP WAS MORE LIKELY TO USE SUBSTANCES AND UNHEALTHY FOOD AND LESS LIKELY TO HAVE GOOD QUALITY SLEEP. YOGA PRACTITIONERS REPORTED GOOD PHYSICAL ABILITY AND ENDURANCE. YOGA GROUP ALSO SHOWED LESS ANXIETY, STRESS, FEAR, AND HAVING BETTER COPING STRATEGIES THAN THE NON-YOGA GROUP. THE YOGA GROUP DISPLAYED STRIKING AND SUPERIOR ABILITY TO COPE WITH STRESS AND ANXIETY ASSOCIATED WITH LOCKDOWN AND COVID-19. IN THE YOGA GROUP, PARTICIPANTS PERFORMING MEDITATION REPORTEDLY HAD RELATIVELY BETTER MENTAL HEALTH. YOGA MAY LEAD TO RISK REDUCTION OF COVID-19 BY DECREASING STRESS AND IMPROVING IMMUNITY IF SPECIFIC YOGA PROTOCOLS ARE IMPLEMENTED THROUGH A GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH INITIATIVE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
11 2360  28 VIDEOCONFERENCED YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR CANCER PATIENTS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: A REPORT FROM A CLINICIAN'S PERSPECTIVE. BACKGROUND: THE ACCEPTABILITY OF VIDEOCONFERENCING DELIVERY OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN THE ADVANCED CANCER SETTING IS RELATIVELY UNEXPLORED. THE CURRENT REPORT SUMMARIZES THE CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS OF THE TRANSITION FROM AN IN-PERSON (IE, FACE-TO-FACE) TO A VIDEOCONFERENCE INTERVENTION DELIVERY APPROACH IN RESPONSE TO THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE PANDEMIC. METHOD: PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED PATIENT-FAMILY CAREGIVER DYADS WHO WERE ENROLLED IN ONGOING YOGA TRIALS AND 2 CERTIFIED YOGA THERAPISTS WHO DELIVERED THE YOGA SESSIONS. WE SUMMARIZED THEIR EXPERIENCES USING RECORDINGS OF THE YOGA SESSIONS AND INTERVENTIONISTS' PROGRESS NOTES. RESULTS: OUT OF 7 DYADS PARTICIPATING IN THE PARENT TRIAL, 1 DECLINED THE VIDEOCONFERENCED SESSIONS. PARTICIPANTS WERE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 55 AND 76 AND MOSTLY NON-HISPANIC WHITE (83%). PATIENTS WERE MAINLY MALE (83%), ALL HAD STAGE III OR IV CANCER AND WERE UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY. CAREGIVERS WERE ALL FEMALE. DESPITE CHALLENGES IN THE AREAS OF TECHNOLOGY, LOCATION, AND SETTING, INSTRUCTION AND PERSONAL CONNECTION, THE OVERALL ACCEPTABILITY WAS HIGH AMONG PATIENTS, CAREGIVERS, AND INSTRUCTORS. THROUGH THIS TRANSITION PROCESS, SOLUTIONS TO THESE CHALLENGES WERE FOUND, WHICH ARE DESCRIBED HERE. CONCLUSION: ALTHOUGH IN-PERSON INTERVENTIONS ARE FAVORED BY BOTH THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS AND THE INTERVENTIONISTS, VIDEOCONFERENCE SESSIONS WERE DEEMED ACCEPTABLE. ALL PARTICIPANTS HAD THE BENEFIT OF A PREVIOUS IN-PERSON EXPERIENCE, WHICH WAS HELPFUL AND PERHAPS NECESSARY FOR OLDER AND ADVANCED CANCER PATIENTS REQUIRING PRACTICE MODIFICATIONS. IN A REMOTE SETTING, THE ASSISTANCE OF CAREGIVERS SEEMS PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL TO ENSURE PRACTICE SAFETY.

12 2035  23 TELE-YOGA FOR CHRONIC PAIN: CURRENT STATUS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS. PAIN IS A PERVASIVE, DEBILITATING DISORDER THAT IS RESISTANT TO LONG-TERM PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS. ALTHOUGH PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPIES SUCH AS COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY DEMONSTRATE MODERATE EFFICACY, MANY INDIVIDUALS CONTINUE TO HAVE ONGOING DIFFICULTIES FOLLOWING TREATMENT. THERE IS A CURRENT TREND TO ESTABLISH COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH INTERVENTIONS FOR CHRONIC PAIN, FOR WHICH YOGA HAS BEEN FOUND TO HAVE EXCITING POTENTIAL. NEVERTHELESS, AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION WITHIN THE FIELD IS ACCESSIBILITY TO ADEQUATE CARE. TELEHEALTH CAN BE USED TO PROVIDE REAL-TIME INTERACTIVE VIDEO CONFERENCING LEADING TO INCREASED ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FOR INDIVIDUALS LOCATED REMOTELY OR WHO OTHERWISE HAVE DIFFICULTY ACCESSING SERVICES, PERHAPS THROUGH ISSUES OF MOBILITY OR PROXIMITY OF ADEQUATE SERVICES. THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES THE CURRENT STATUS AND FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING TELE-YOGA FOR CHRONIC PAIN. METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH ARE DISCUSSED.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
13 1767  36 POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA IN PREGNANCY-RELATED COMPLICATIONS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND IMPLICATIONS FOR WORKING WOMEN. BACKGROUND: PREGNANCY IS A VULNERABLE PERIOD OF GROWTH AND ENRICHMENT ALONG WITH MANY PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CHALLENGES. THESE CHANGES CAN LEAD TO COMPLICATIONS IF COMPOUNDED BY EXTERNAL STRESS AND ANXIETY. COVID-19 HAS EMERGED AS A CHIEF STRESSOR AMONG THE GENERAL POPULATION AND IS A SERIOUS THREAT AMONG VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. THEREFORE, THERE IS A NEED FOR STRESS MANAGEMENT TOOLS, SUCH AS YOGA AND PHYSICAL EXERCISES, BOTH AT HOME AND AT WORK. THESE CAN BE ADOPTED DURING THE PANDEMIC WITH PROPER MAINTENANCE OF SOCIAL DISTANCING. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE AND COMPILE LITERATURE THAT HAS REPORTED THE HEALTH OUTCOMES OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON PREGNANCY AT THE WORKPLACE AND ANALYZES BOTH THE RESTRICTIONS AS WELL AS ADVANTAGES OF ITS BENEFICIAL EFFECTS IN COMPARISON TO PHYSICAL EXERCISES. METHODOLOGY: A COMPREHENSIVE LITERATURE REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED UTILIZING PUBMED AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR. THE KEYWORDS USED FOR THE SEARCH INCLUDE "YOGA", "WORK", "COMPLICATIONS", "PHYSICAL EXERCISE", "DRUGS" AND "COVID" INDIFFERENT PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS WITH "PREGNANCY". WE COMPILED THE LITERATURE WITH RESPECT TO PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS AND THE EFFECTS OF DRUGS, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND YOGA FOR PREVENTING THESE COMPLICATIONS. RESULTS: WE NOTED THAT PREGNANCY-RELATED COMPLICATIONS ARE BECOMING MORE PREVALENT BECAUSE OF A SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE, RESTRICTED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND GROWING STRESS. IN SUCH SITUATIONS, A HOME OR WORKPLACE YOGA PROTOCOL CAN COMBINE BOTH EXERCISE AND MINDFULNESS-BASED ALLEVIATION OF ANXIETY FOR BOTH WORKING AND NON-WORKING WOMEN. CONCLUSION: YOGA CAN BE EFFECTIVE FOR COMBATING STRESS AND ANXIETY BESIDES BOOSTING IMMUNITY IN PREGNANT WORKING WOMEN CONFRONTED WITH THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.	2020

15 1996  36 STAY MINDFULLY ACTIVE DURING THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC: A FEASIBILITY STUDY OF MHEALTH-DELIVERED MINDFULNESS YOGA PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE. IMPORTANCE: PATIENTS WITH LONG-TERM NEUROLOGICAL CONDITIONS, SUCH AS PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD), ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES TAKEN TO COMBAT THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE INACCESSIBILITY OF CENTER-BASED REHABILITATION FURTHER AGGRAVATED THEIR MOTOR DYSFUNCTIONS AS WELL AS MENTAL DISTRESS, LEADING TO EXACERBATION OF MOTOR AND NON-MOTOR SYMPTOMS, HIGH HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION AND WORSENED HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL). OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY, SAFETY, AND PRELIMINARY EFFECTS OF THE MHEALTH-DELIVERED HOME-BASED MINDFULNESS YOGA PROGRAM ON FUNCTIONAL BALANCE, MOTOR SYMPTOMS, MENTAL HEALTH AND HRQOL IN PATIENTS WITH PD. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: THIS PROSPECTIVE, SINGLE-ARM, NON-RANDOMIZED FEASIBILITY STUDY ADOPTED A SEQUENTIAL EXPLANATORY MIXED-METHOD DESIGN. ADULTS (AGED >/= 18) WITH A CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS OF IDIOPATHIC PARKINSON'S DISEASE (HOEHN AND YAHR STAGE I TO III) WHO WERE ABLE TO STAND UNAIDED AND WALK WITH OR WITHOUT AN ASSISTIVE DEVICE WERE ENROLLED VIA CONVENIENCE SAMPLING. INTERVENTION: HOME-BASED MINDFULNESS YOGA TRAINING WERE DELIVERED VIA VIDEO-CONFERENCING SOFTWARE (ZOOM) IN EIGHT BI-WEEKLY 90-MIN SESSIONS. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: THIS CURRENT STUDY MEASURED FUNCTIONAL BALANCE, MOTOR SYMPTOMS, PERCEIVED BALANCE CONFIDENCE, PERCEIVED FREEZING OF GAIT SYMPTOMS, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, MINDFULNESS AND HRQOL USING A TELE-ASSESSMENT APPROACH AT BASELINE AND 1-WEEK POST-INTERVENTION. ALL PARTICIPANTS WERE INVITED TO ATTEND QUALITATIVE INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS TO EXPLORE THEIR EXPERIENCE OF USING ONLINE MINDFULNESS YOGA PROGRAM AS A LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION FOR PD REHABILITATION. RESULTS: AMONG THE TEN PATIENTS, 80% COMPLETED THE PROGRAM WITH AN ADHERENCE RATE OF 98.4%. ALL PARTICIPANTS WERE ABLE TO LEARN AND PRACTICE MINDFULNESS YOGA FOLLOWING THE EIGHT BI-WEEKLY ONLINE MINDFULNESS YOGA TRAINING SESSIONS, WITHOUT ANY SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EVENTS. TELE-ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES WERE FEASIBLE AND UNEVENTFUL. QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK REVEALED PARTICIPANTS HAD A HIGH PREFERENCE OF USING THE TELE-REHABILITATION APPROACH TO STAY MINDFUL AND BEING ACTIVE, BOTH PHYSICALLY AND SOCIALLY, WHILE CONFRONTING THE CHANGES BROUGHT BY COVID-19 PANDEMIC. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: THE MHEALTH-DELIVERED HOME-BASED MINDFULNESS YOGA INTERVENTION WAS FEASIBLE, SAFE, AND WELL-ACCEPTED AMONG PEOPLE WITH PD TO RELIEVE THE BURDEN BROUGHT BY COVID-19 PANDEMIC. FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD ADOPT A DESIGN WITH ENHANCED RIGOR, A COMPARISON GROUP, AND ENLARGED SAMPLE SIZE TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF THE PROGRAM IN PATIENTS WITH LONG-TERM NEUROLOGICAL CONDITIONS AND/OR PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENTS. WE RECOMMEND A LONGER INTERVENTION DURATION OF AT LEAST 8 WEEKS TO ENHANCE THE PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS.	2022	

16 2032  28 TAILORING TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA FOR HIGH-RISK POPULATIONS IN PUBLIC-SECTOR SETTINGS. LOW-INCOME, RACIAL-MINORITY, HIGH-RISK POPULATIONS HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENTS FOR POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD), AND THEIR ACCEPTANCE OF COMPLEMENTARY INTERVENTIONS IS UNKNOWN. TRAUMA CENTER TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA (TC-TSY), WHICH HAS DEMONSTRATED EFFICACY IN COMMUNITY SAMPLES, HAS NOT YET BEEN WIDELY USED WITH ETHNIC MINORITY LOW-INCOME INDIVIDUALS. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A CULTURALLY TAILORED VERSION OF A TC-TSY INTERVENTION DELIVERED AS A DROP-IN SERVICE IN A PUBLIC HOSPITAL-BASED CLINIC TO PATIENTS WITH HISTORIES OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE AND SUICIDE ATTEMPTS. TC-TSY WAS ITERATIVELY TAILORED TO MEET THE UNIQUE CLINICAL NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THIS SETTING. GROUP FACILITATOR OBSERVATIONS ARE SUMMARIZED; THEY DESCRIBE A SUCCESSFUL INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION AND CULTURALLY INFORMED ADAPTATION OF THE GROUP INTERVENTION. THE FACILITATORS' OBSERVATIONS ILLUSTRATED THAT GROUP MEMBERS ACCEPTED THE INTEGRATION OF THIS STRUCTURED, GENTLE YOGA PRACTICE INTO OUTPATIENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAMMING AND IDENTIFIED SITE-SPECIFIC MODIFICATIONS TO INFORM FORMAL STUDY. THE PROCESS BY WHICH TC-TSY WAS ADAPTED AND IMPLEMENTED FOR BLACK INDIVIDUALS WITH A HISTORY OF INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA AT RISK FOR SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR CAN SERVE AS A GUIDE FOR TAILORING OTHER COMPLEMENTARY, INTEGRATIVE INTERVENTIONS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF UNIQUE CLINICAL SETTINGS. THIS PROCESS IS OFFERED AS A FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE SYSTEMATIC TESTING OF THIS COMPLEMENTARY, INTEGRATED, CULTURALLY ADAPTED TRAUMA THERAPY IN HIGH-RISK CLINICAL POPULATIONS.	2021

AIM: THE AIM WAS TO STUDY GLOBAL PUBLIC INTEREST IN YOGA FOR MENTAL HEALTH DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: GLOBAL TIME TRENDS WERE OBTAINED FOR YOGA, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION FROM NOVEMBER 1, 2019 TO MAY 31, 2020 USING GT. THE TIME SERIES ANALYSIS WAS DONE IN THREE DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS - PRE-COVID-19 PHASE, TRANSITION PERIOD, AND COVID-19 PANDEMIC PHASE. CROSS-CORRELATION, SPEARMAN RHO, FRIEDMAN ANOVA TEST, AND FORECASTING WERE USED FOR ANALYSIS. RESULTS: GT FOUND A GLOBAL CHANGE IN THE SEARCH QUERIES FOR YOGA, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION DURING THE THREE TIME PERIODS. HIGH BURDEN COVID-19 COUNTRIES - ITALY, SPAIN, RUSSIA, AND BRAZIL HAD AN INCREASING SEARCH TREND FOR YOGA. DURING THE COVID-19 PHASE, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE SEARCH TRENDS OF YOGA WITH DEPRESSION (R = 0.232; P < 0.05) AND ANXIETY (R = 0.351; P < 0.05), BUT HIGHER ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SEARCHES LEAD TO LOWER YOGA SEARCHES AT LAG +6. FORECAST PROJECTED A CONTINUOUS INCREASE IN YOGA SEARCHES AND ANXIETY QUERIES. CONCLUSION: GOOGLE TRENDS CAPTURED A SIGNIFICANT RISE IN INTEREST OF YOGA AMONG THE GLOBAL COMMUNITY BUT DIMINISHED WITH TIME. HENCE, THE NEED FOR INTERVENTIONS TO PROMOTE YOGA TO BE PART OF ROUTINE LIFE AND FOR MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE ADHERE TO THE YOGA PRACTICES ON A CONTINUOUS BASIS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
20 2767  28 YOGA PROVISION FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: IS THE FUTURE ONLINE? BACKGROUND: YOGA HAS MULTIPLE BENEFITS FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS), INCLUDING REDUCED PAIN, DEPRESSION, FATIGUE, STRENGTH, AND IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE. DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, HOME-BASED DELIVERY OF YOGA INCREASED. HOWEVER, NO STUDIES TO DATE HAVE EXPLORED ONLINE HOME-BASED YOGA FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MS, MORE SPECIFICALLY THE MOTIVATIONS, EXPERIENCES, OR THE SUSTAINABILITY OF HOME-BASED YOGA PRACTICE FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MS. AIM: THIS STUDY AIMED TO EXPLORE THE FACILITATORS AND BARRIERS OF ONLINE YOGA PROVISION FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MS. METHODS: ONE FOCUS GROUP AND THREE SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE CARRIED OUT ONLINE VIA ZOOM WITH ONE YOGA INSTRUCTOR AND SEVEN YOGA PARTICIPANTS LIVING WITH MS. THEMATIC ANALYSIS WAS USED TO ANALYSE THIS DATA. FINDINGS: TWO THEMES WERE GENERATED FROM THE INTERVIEWS, THE ENVIRONMENT AND FUTURE PROVISION, EACH WITH THEIR OWN SUB-THEMES. THE THEMES REFLECT VARIOUS FACILITATORS AND BARRIERS OF HOME-BASED YOGA PROVISION WHICH DIFFERED DEPENDING UPON THE INDIVIDUALS HOME ENVIRONMENT, SOCIAL CONNECTIONS, PHYSICAL ABILITY, AND CONFIDENCE PRACTISING YOGA. FURTHERMORE, PREFERENCES OF HOME PROVISION FLUCTUATED OVER TIME DEPENDING UPON SYMPTOMS OF MS. CONCLUSIONS: HOME-BASED YOGA PRACTICE IS A VIABLE AND ENJOYABLE OPTION FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MS. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOGA STUDIOS OFFERING HOME-BASED YOGA PROVISION CONSIDER INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN PREFERENCE, AS WELL AS FLUCTUATIONS IN SYMPTOMS THAT MAY CREATE INEQUITABLE ACCESS TO SERVICES AND MAY PREVENT PARTICIPATION FOR SOME.	2022

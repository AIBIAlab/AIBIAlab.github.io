1  561 81 CREATING SPACE THROUGH AFRICA YOGA PROJECT: A QUALITATIVE STUDY. THIS QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS EXAMINED TEACHERS' EXPERIENCES OF THE AFRICA YOGA PROJECT (AYP), A MENTORING-ORIENTED YOGA PROGRAM FOR FOSTERING RESILIENCE AMONG INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS IMPACTED BY POVERTY AND TRAUMA. INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED WITH AYP TEACHERS WERE CODED USING QUALITATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS. THEMES DEMONSTRATED THAT AYP BENEFITED PARTICIPANTS BY CREATING S.P.A.C.E. (SAFETY AND STABILITY, PERSONAL GROWTH, ACTION, CULTURAL DIVERSITY, AND EMPOWERMENT). THE FINDINGS ILLUSTRATED WAYS IN WHICH THIS PROGRAM FOSTERED INDIVIDUAL AND COMMUNITY WELLNESS AND POSITIVE ENGAGEMENT. IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL FOR PROVIDING YOGA AS A LOW-COST, SUSTAINABLE, AND EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION TO PROMOTE HEALTH, ECONOMIC SELF-SUFFICIENCY, AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IN DIVERSE SETTINGS WITH LIMITED RESOURCES.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
2 2047 27 THE AFRICA YOGA PROJECT AND WELL-BEING: A CONCEPT MAP OF STUDENTS' PERCEPTIONS. BACKGROUND: CONCEPT MAPPING METHODOLOGY WAS USED TO EXPLORE THE PERCEIVED IMPACT OF PRACTICING YOGA WITH THE AFRICA YOGA PROJECT (AYP)-AN ORGANISATION CREATED TO INCREASE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING BY PROVIDING COMMUNITY-BASED YOGA CLASSES THROUGHOUT KENYA. AYP'S MISSION FIT WITH THEORETICAL MODELS OF WELL-BEING IS DISCUSSED. ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE AND INITIAL QUALITATIVE RESEARCH SUGGESTED THE AYP MEANINGFULLY IMPACTED ADULT STUDENTS. METHODS: OF THE HUNDREDS OF AYP'S ADULT STUDENTS, 56 AND 82 STUDENTS PARTICIPATED IN PHASES I AND II, RESPECTIVELY. PHASE I BRAINSTORMING RESULTED IN 94 STUDENT-GENERATED STATEMENTS ABOUT THEIR PERCEIVED CHANGE. PHASE II PARTICIPANTS SORTED AND RATED STATEMENTS IN TERMS OF IMPORTANCE. MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING AND HIERARCHICAL CLUSTER ANALYSIS OF SORT DATA WAS UTILISED TO MAP AND GROUP STATEMENTS INTO CLUSTERS. RESULTS: BASED ON STATISTICAL AND INTERPRETIVE CRITERIA, A FIVE-CLUSTER SOLUTION WITH THE FOLLOWING CONCEPTS WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE BEST MODEL OF STUDENTS' CHANGE: PERSONAL GROWTH; INTERPERSONAL EFFECTIVENESS (LOWEST IMPORTANCE); PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL BENEFITS; EMOTIONAL RESILIENCY; AND IMPROVED SELF-CONCEPT (HIGHEST IMPORTANCE). CONCLUSIONS: OVERALL, STUDENTS REPORTED POSITIVE PERCEPTIONS OF THE AYP. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO QUANTIFY STUDENTS' CHANGE, AND TO COMPARE THE AYP OUTCOMES TO THOSE OF OTHER PROGRAMS AIMED AT POVERTY-RELATED STRESS REDUCTION AND WELL-BEING.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
3 2048 29 THE AFRICA YOGA PROJECT: A PARTICIPANT-DRIVEN CONCEPT MAP OF KENYAN TEACHERS' REPORTED EXPERIENCES. OBJECTIVE: THE AFRICA YOGA PROJECT (AYP) TRAINS AND FUNDS KENYANS TO TEACH COMMUNITY YOGA CLASSES. PRELIMINARY RESEARCH WITH A SMALL SAMPLE OF AYP TEACHERS SUGGESTED THE PROGRAM HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT. THIS STUDY USED CONCEPT MAPPING TO EXPLORE THE EXPERIENCES OF A LARGER SAMPLE. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS BRAINSTORMED STATEMENTS ABOUT HOW PRACTICING AND/OR TEACHING YOGA CHANGED THEM. THEY SORTED STATEMENTS INTO SELF-DEFINED PILES AND RATED THEM IN TERMS OF PERCEIVED IMPORTANCE. MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING (MDS) OF SORT DATA CALCULATED STATEMENT COORDINATES WHEREIN EACH STATEMENT IS PLACED IN PROXIMITY TO OTHER STATEMENTS AS A FUNCTION OF HOW FREQUENTLY STATEMENTS ARE SORTED TOGETHER BY PARTICIPANTS. THESE RESULTS ARE THEN AND MAPPED IN A TWO-DIMENSIONAL SPACE. HIERARCHICAL CLUSTER ANALYSIS (HCA) OF THESE DATA IDENTIFIED CLUSTERS (I.E., CONCEPTS) AMONG STATEMENTS. CLUSTER AVERAGE IMPORTANCE RATINGS GAVE THE CONCEPT MAP DEPTH AND INDICATED CONCEPT IMPORTANCE. BRIDGING ANALYSIS AND RESEARCHERS' CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF YOGA LITERATURE FACILITATED HCA INTERPRETIVE DECISIONS. RESULTS: OF 72 AYP TEACHERS, 52 AND 48 TEACHERS PARTICIPATED IN BRAINSTORMING AND SORTING/RATING ACTIVITIES, RESPECTIVELY. TEACHERS BRAINSTORMED 93 STATEMENTS ABOUT HOW THEY HAD CHANGED. THE RESULTANT MDS STATEMENT MAP HAD ADEQUATE VALIDITY (STRESS VALUE = .29). HCA CREATED A 12-CLUSTER SOLUTION WITH THE FOLLOWING CONCEPTS OF PERCEIVED CHANGE: IDENTITY AS A YOGA TEACHER; PROSOCIAL DEVELOPMENT; EXISTENTIAL POSSIBILITY; GENUINE POSITIVE REGARD; VALUE AND RESPECT FOR OTHERS (HIGHEST IMPORTANCE); PRESENCE, ACCEPTANCE, AND COMPETENCE; SERVICE AND TRUST; NON-JUDGMENT AND EMOTION REGULATION (LOWEST IMPORTANCE); ENGAGEMENT AND CONNECTION; INTERPERSONAL EFFECTIVENESS; PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING; AND PHYSICAL COMPETENCE AND SECURITY. CONCLUSIONS: TEACHERS PERCEIVED THE AYP AS FACILITATING CHANGE ACROSS PHYSICAL, MENTAL, AND SPIRITUAL DOMAINS. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO QUANTIFY AND COMPARE THIS CHANGE TO OTHER HEALTH PROMOTION PROGRAM OUTCOMES.	2015	

4   10 29 "MAKING IT OKAY": PROFESSIONALS IN HIGH-STRESS ENVIRONMENTS CONSTRUCT THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT OF A YOGA-BASED RETREAT DESIGNED TO BUILD RESILIENCE. PURPOSE: WHILE THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE FOR RESILIENCE BUILDING PROGRAMMES, TO DATE RESEARCH HAS NOT EXPLORED HOW PROFESSIONALS CONSTRUCT UNDERSTANDING OF PROGRAMME IMPACT. RISE (RESILIENCE, INTEGRATION, SELF-AWARENESS, ENGAGEMENT), A 5-DAY YOGA-BASED RETREAT PROGRAMME, HAS BEEN LINKED WITH POSITIVE WELLNESS OUTCOMES. THIS QUALITATIVE INQUIRY EXPLORES PARTICIPANTS' REFLECTION AND EXPERIENCE 3 MONTHS AFTER PROGRAMME COMPLETION. METHODS: THROUGH A GROUNDED CONSTRUCTIVIST LENS, IN-DEPTH SEMI-STRUCTURED PHONE INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH 17 ADULT PROFESSIONALS IN HIGH-STRESS WORK ENVIRONMENTS WHO ATTENDED RISE. INITIAL HAND-CODING INFORMED CODEBOOK DEVELOPMENT FOR SYSTEMATIC CODING USING DIRECTED CONTENT ANALYSIS USING SENSITIZING STRUCTURING. RESULTS: TWO INTEGRATED PERCEPTIONS WOVEN THROUGH FIVE THEMES. PERSISTENT THREADS OF EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING AND SENSE OF PERMISSION PROVIDED STRUCTURE FOR THEMES FOUND. FIVE INTERRELATED THEMES RELATED TO PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH AND WORKPLACE DYNAMICS WERE (1) USE OF ACQUIRED BEHAVIOURAL SKILLS AND PRACTICES; (2) LIVED MINDFULNESS; (3) RESILIENCE TO STRESS AND EMOTION REGULATION (4) SELF-CARE AND SELF-COMPASSION, AND (5) SHARING WITH OTHERS. CONCLUSION: FINDINGS PROVIDE MEANINGFUL INTERPRETATION OF PREVIOUSLY REPORTED PROGRAMME EFFICACY BY CONTEXTUALIZING PERCEIVED BENEFITS WITHIN PARTICIPANTS' CONSTRUCTED UNDERSTANDING OF CHANGE. SPECIFICALLY, ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND EXPERIENTIAL CONSIDERATIONS HAVE SUGGESTED IMPLICATIONS FOR RESILIENCE BUILDING PROGRAMMES.ABBREVIATIONS: RISE (RESILIENCE, INTEGRATION, SELF-AWARENESS, ENGAGEMENT).	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
5 1343 30 HOW YOGA IMPACTS THE SUBSTANCE USE OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV WHO ARE IN REENTRY FROM PRISON OR JAIL: A QUALITATIVE STUDY. OBJECTIVES: NASCENT RESEARCH REFLECTS THE PROMISE OF YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR SUBSTANCE USE. WHILE PUTATIVE MECHANISMS BEHIND YOGA'S IMPACT ON SUBSTANCE USE HAVE BEEN PROPOSED, THE RESEARCH IS LIMITED. THIS MANUSCRIPT AIMS TO DETERMINE HOW A HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION IMPACTS THE SUBSTANCE USE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN REENTRY FROM PRISON OR JAIL (RETURNING CITIZENS), AND LIVING WITH HIV AND SUBSTANCE USE PROBLEMS. DESIGN: SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH 28 RETURNING CITIZENS WHO PARTICIPATED IN A YOGA INTERVENTION. GUIDED BY A QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTIVE METHODOLOGY, THEMATIC ANALYSIS WAS USED TO IDENTIFY THEMES THAT ANSWERED HOW YOGA IMPACTED PARTICIPANT SUBSTANCE USE. SETTING: A COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN PHILADELPHIA, PA, USA THAT CONNECTS PEOPLE TO HEALTH SERVICES, PROVIDES EDUCATION AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES, AND ADVOCATES FOR PEOPLE WITH CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT. INTERVENTION: A 90-MINUTE HATHA YOGA CLASS OFFERED ONCE A WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS. RESULTS: FOURTEEN PARTICIPANTS REPORTED THAT YOGA EITHER REDUCED SUBSTANCE USE OR MAINTAINED NON-USE, VIA THE MECHANISMS OF PURPOSEFUL DISTRACTION, STRESS COPING (BY CULTIVATING MINDFULNESS AND REDUCING PHYSICAL DISCOMFORT), SOCIAL SUPPORT AND CONFIDENCE. ELEVEN PARTICIPANTS REPORTED THAT YOGA DID NOT IMPACT THEIR SUBSTANCE USE. THREE PARTICIPANTS DID NOT DISCUSS IT. CONCLUSIONS: BY PROVIDING PURPOSEFUL DISTRACTION, INCREASED STRESS COPING, SOCIAL SUPPORT AND CONFIDENCE; YOGA MAY REDUCE SUBSTANCE USE AND MAINTAIN ENGAGEMENT IN RECOVERY. THESE MECHANISTIC ACTIONS PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR THEMES TO HIGHLIGHT IN YOGA CLASSES THAT AIM TO IMPACT SUBSTANCE USE AMONG RETURNING CITIZENS LIVING WITH HIV.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
6 2314 23 TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA TRAINING IN KENYA: A QUALITATIVE PILOT STUDY ON FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY. THE CURRENT STUDY PRESENTS A PILOT QUALITATIVE EXPLORATION OF THE COLLABORATION OF TWO YOGA SERVICE AGENCIES IN IMPLEMENTING A TRAUMA-INFORMED MINDFULNESS-BASED TEACHING CURRICULUM IN KENYA, AFRICA. YOGA AND MINDFULNESS PRACTICES HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED AS SUCCESSFUL COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO MANAGING THE IMPACTS OF STRESS TRAUMA. THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF MINDFULNESS PROGRAMMING FOR YOGA TEACHERS IN THE NAIROBI REGION OF KENYA. GROUNDED THEORY IS USED TO EXPLORE SURVEY RESULTS. OUTCOMES DEMONSTRATE PROMISE FOR BOTH ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY. CURRICULUM TOOLS WERE VIEWED AS EFFECTIVE, AND PARTICIPANTS INDICATED INTENTION TO BOTH UTILIZE AND SHARE TOOLS. REFLECTIONS ON PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS AND IMPACTS ARE ADDRESSED, AS ARE POTENTIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPROVED PROGRAM TRANSLATION. FINDINGS SUGGEST THE POTENTIAL BENEFIT FOR FUTURE COLLABORATIONS, AND ALSO SUGGEST BEST PRACTICES CONSIDERATIONS FOR GLOBAL IMPLEMENTATION OF EMBODIED MINDFULNESS PROGRAMMING.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
7 1342 25 HOW YOGA HELPS HEAL INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA: PERSPECTIVES AND THEMES FROM 11 INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA SURVIVORS. TRAUMA IS UBIQUITOUS IN OUR SOCIETY; THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO EXPLORE HOW INDIVIDUALS CULTIVATE HEALING AFTER TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES. YOGA MAY BE ONE AVENUE TO CULTIVATE HEALING. QUALITATIVE METHODS WERE EMPLOYED TO STUDY THE ROLE YOGA PRACTICE PLAYED IN THE HEALING PROCESS OF THOSE WHO EXPERIENCED INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA. ELEVEN INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA SURVIVORS WHO PRACTICED YOGA REGULARLY WERE IDENTIFIED THROUGH A CRITERION SAMPLING METHOD. DATA ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE EMPHASIS OF YOGA ON MIND AND PHYSICAL BODY FOSTERED NUMEROUS POSITIVE OUTCOMES, SUCH AS SPIRITUAL GROWTH, SELF-ACCEPTANCE, ALLEVIATION OF TRAUMA-RELATED SYMPTOMS, AND INCREASED FEELINGS OF SELF-COMPASSION, EMPOWERMENT, AND SERENITY. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY BE HELPFUL TO REGAIN MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH, FOSTER WELLBEING, AND CULTIVATE PERSONAL GROWTH AFTER INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
8   21 26 "YOGA RESETS MY INNER PEACE BAROMETER": A QUALITATIVE STUDY ILLUMINATING THE PATHWAYS OF HOW YOGA IMPACTS ONE'S RELATIONSHIP TO ONESELF AND TO OTHERS. OBJECTIVES: THE PURPOSE OF THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY WAS TWOFOLD: (1) TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW YOGA PRACTITIONERS PERCEIVE INTRA- AND INTERPERSONAL OUTCOMES OF THEIR YOGA PRACTICE, AND (2) TO DEVELOP A CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF YOGA EFFECTS ON INTRA- AND INTERPERSONAL OUTCOMES THAT MAY UNDERLIE THE "RELATIONAL" INFLUENCES OF YOGA. DESIGN: AS PART OF A LARGER STUDY, 107 COMMUNITY-DWELLING YOGA PRACTITIONERS (AGE M=41.2+/-15.9YEARS) COMPLETED OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS WHICH ASKED QUESTIONS FOCUSING ON WHETHER YOGA INFLUENCES ONE'S RELATIONSHIP TO ONESELF AND TO OTHERS. A SUBSAMPLE (N=12) COMPLETED IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS. THE OPEN-ENDED RESPONSES WERE ANALYZED USING CONTENT ANALYSIS, AND VERBATIM INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTS WERE ANALYZED FOR EMERGENT THEMES USING A CONSTANT COMPARISON APPROACH. RESULTS: FOUR EMERGING THEMES WERE IDENTIFIED SUCH THAT PRACTITIONERS TALKED ABOUT THE ABILITY OF YOGA TO GENERATE CALM STATES, MINDFULNESS, (SELF-)COMPASSION, AND A SENSE OF CONNECTEDNESS. THROUGHOUT THE THEMES, A COMMON PATTERN EMERGED SUCH THAT YOGA PRACTICE FIRST LED TO POSITIVE INTRAPERSONAL CHANGES, WHICH THEN INFLUENCED ONE'S INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS. BASED ON THESE RESULTS, A CONCEPTUAL MODEL WAS DEVELOPED DEPICTING POTENTIAL PATHWAYS OF HOW YOGA WORKS TO ENHANCE RELATIONAL OUTCOMES. CONCLUSION: FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE THE PROMISE YOGA HOLDS TO IMPROVE ONE'S RELATIONSHIP TO ONESELF (INTRAPERSONAL) THROUGH MINDFULNESS AND SELF-COMPASSION, AND TO OTHERS (INTERPERSONAL), THROUGH THE ENHANCEMENT OF COMPASSION AND SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS, WHICH MAY POTENTIALLY LEAD TO ENHANCED HEALTH AND WELLBEING OUTCOMES. FURTHER EMPIRICAL TESTING OF THE MODEL IS WARRANTED.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
9  250 28 A YOGA INTERVENTION PROGRAM FOR PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM SYMPTOMS OF POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER: A QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTIVE STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO UNDERSTAND HOW INDIVIDUALS WITH SYMPTOMS OF POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) PERCEIVE A TRAUMA-SENSITIVE KUNDALINI YOGA (KY) PROGRAM. METHODS: DIGITALLY RECORDED TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS 30-60 MINUTES IN DURATION WERE CONDUCTED WITH 40 INDIVIDUALS WITH PTSD PARTICIPATING IN AN 8-WEEK KY TREATMENT PROGRAM. INTERVIEWS WERE TRANSCRIBED VERBATIM AND ANALYZED USING QUALITATIVE THEMATIC ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES. RESULTS: QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS IDENTIFIES THREE MAJOR THEMES: SELF-OBSERVED CHANGES, NEW AWARENESS, AND THE YOGA PROGRAM ITSELF. FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT PARTICIPANTS NOTED CHANGES IN AREAS OF HEALTH AND WELL-BEING, LIFESTYLE, PSYCHOSOCIAL INTEGRATION, AND PERCEPTIONS OF SELF IN RELATION TO THE WORLD. PRESENTED ARE PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS FOR TRAUMA-RELATED PROGRAMMING. CONCLUSION: THERE IS A NEED TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE AND POTENTIALLY EMPOWERING APPROACHES TO TRAUMA TREATMENT. YOGA-RELATED SELF-CARE OR SELF-MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES ARE WIDELY ACCESSIBLE, ARE EMPOWERING, AND MAY ADDRESS THE MIND-BODY ELEMENTS OF PTSD.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
10  155 28 A QUALITATIVE STUDY EXPLORING YOGA IN VETERANS WITH PTSD SYMPTOMS. QUANTITATIVE STUDIES OF YOGA HAVE REPORTED REDUCED POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) SYMPTOMS IN VETERANS, BUT LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW AND WHY VETERANS ARE ATTRACTED TO AND STICK WITH A YOGA PRACTICE. GUIDED BY THE HEALTH BELIEF MODEL, THIS STUDY EXAMINED VETERANS' PERCEPTIONS OF THE BENEFITS, BARRIERS, AND MOTIVATIONS TO CONTINUE PRACTICING TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA. INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH NINE INDIVIDUALS, FIVE OF WHOM COMPLETED A 6-WEEK TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA INTERVENTION DESIGNED FOR VETERANS AND FOUR WHO DID NOT COMPLETE THE INTERVENTION. TRANSCRIPTS WERE ANALYZED FOR THEMES. THE BENEFITS IDENTIFIED BY VETERANS WERE FINDING MENTAL STILLNESS, BODY AWARENESS, AND SOCIAL CONNECTION. THE BARRIERS WERE PERCEPTIONS THAT YOGA IS SOCIALLY UNACCEPTABLE, ESPECIALLY FOR MEN, AND PHYSICALLY UNCHALLENGING. UNDERSTANDING THESE BENEFITS AND BARRIERS CAN HELP TO MAKE YOGA MORE ATTRACTIVE TO SERVICE MEMBERS AND VETERANS. FOR EXAMPLE, MEDICAL PERSONNEL CAN REFER SERVICE MEMBERS AND VETERANS TO YOGA NOT ONLY FOR PTSD SYMPTOMS, BUT ALSO TO ADDRESS BACK PAIN AND TO REDUCE ISOLATION. ACCESS TO MALE YOGA INSTRUCTORS, ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE THEMSELVES SERVICE MEMBERS OR VETERANS, COULD BE EXPANDED, AND CLASSES COULD BE INTEGRATED INTO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ROUTINES REQUIRED OF ACTIVE-DUTY PERSONNEL. PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS CAN FEATURE MALE SERVICE MEMBERS AND VETERANS WITH CAPTIONS RELATED TO YOGA AS A WAY TO INCREASE RESILIENCY, SELF-SUFFICIENCY, AND PHYSICAL AND MENTAL MISSION READINESS. FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY CAN HELP THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND THE VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION IMPLEMENT YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT OR ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT FOR VETERANS WITH PTSD SYMPTOMS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
11 2310 17 TRANSFORMING TRAUMA: A QUALITATIVE FEASIBILITY STUDY OF INTEGRATIVE RESTORATION (IREST) YOGA NIDRA ON COMBAT-RELATED POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. THIS EIGHT-WEEK STUDY EXAMINED THE FEASIBILITY OF OFFERING WEEKLY CLASSES IN INTEGRATIVE RESTORATION (IREST), A FORM OF MINDFULNESS MEDITATION, TO MILITARY COMBAT VETERANS AT A COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH AGENCY IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. PARTICIPANTS WERE 16 MALE COMBAT VETERANS (15 VIETNAM WAR AND 1 IRAQ WAR) OF MIXED ETHNICITY, AGED 41 TO 66 YEARS, SUFFERING FROM POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD). THE 11 PARTICIPANTS WHO COMPLETED THE STUDY REPORTED REDUCED RAGE, ANXIETY, AND EMOTIONAL REACTIVITY, AND INCREASED FEELINGS OF RELAXATION, PEACE, SELF-AWARENESS, AND SELF-EFFICACY, DESPITE CHALLENGES WITH MENTAL FOCUS, INTRUSIVE MEMORIES, AND OTHER CONCERNS. ALL PARTICIPANTS REPORTED THEY WOULD HAVE ATTENDED ONGOING IREST CLASSES AT THE AGENCY APPROXIMATELY ONCE PER WEEK.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
12  145 32 A QUALITATIVE EVALUATION OF STUDENT LEARNING AND SKILLS USE IN A SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PROGRAM. PREVIOUS STUDIES ON SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PROGRAMS HAVE FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENT OF PROGRAM OUTCOMES. THIS STUDY USED QUALITATIVE DATA TO INVESTIGATE PROGRAM CONTENT AND SKILLS THAT STUDENTS REMEMBERED AND APPLIED IN THEIR DAILY LIVES. DATA WERE GATHERED FOLLOWING A 16-WEEK MINDFULNESS AND YOGA INTERVENTION DELIVERED AT THREE URBAN SCHOOLS BY A COMMUNITY NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION. WE CONDUCTED FOCUS GROUPS AND INTERVIEWS WITH NINE CLASSROOM TEACHERS WHO DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM AND HELD SIX FOCUS GROUPS WITH 22 FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADE PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS. THIS STUDY ADDRESSES TWO PRIMARY RESEARCH QUESTIONS: (1) WHAT SKILLS DID STUDENTS LEARN, RETAIN, AND UTILIZE OUTSIDE THE PROGRAM? AND (2) WHAT CHANGES DID CLASSROOM TEACHERS EXPECT AND OBSERVE AMONG PROGRAM RECIPIENTS? FOUR MAJOR THEMES RELATED TO SKILL LEARNING AND APPLICATION EMERGED AS FOLLOWS: (1) YOUTHS RETAINED AND UTILIZED PROGRAM SKILLS INVOLVING BREATH WORK AND POSES; (2) KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HEALTH BENEFITS OF THESE TECHNIQUES PROMOTED SELF-UTILIZATION AND SHARING OF SKILLS; (3) YOUTHS DEVELOPED KEENER EMOTIONAL APPRAISAL THAT, COUPLED WITH NEW AND IMPROVED EMOTIONAL REGULATION SKILLS, HELPED DE-ESCALATE NEGATIVE EMOTIONS, PROMOTE CALM, AND REDUCE STRESS; AND (4) YOUTHS AND TEACHERS REPORTED REALISTIC AND OPTIMISTIC EXPECTATIONS FOR FUTURE IMPACT OF ACQUIRED PROGRAM SKILLS. WE DISCUSS IMPLICATIONS OF THESE FINDINGS FOR GUIDING FUTURE RESEARCH AND PRACTICE.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
13  148 24 A QUALITATIVE EXPLORATION OF IMPLEMENTATION FACTORS IN A SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PROGRAM: LESSONS LEARNED FROM STUDENTS AND TEACHERS. IDENTIFYING FACTORS RELEVANT FOR SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF SCHOOL-BASED INTERVENTIONS IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THAT PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED IN AN EFFECTIVE AND ENGAGING MANNER. THE PERSPECTIVES OF TWO KEY STAKEHOLDERS CRITICAL FOR IDENTIFYING IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS - STUDENTS AND THEIR CLASSROOM TEACHERS - MERIT ATTENTION IN THIS CONTEXT AND HAVE RARELY BEEN EXPLORED USING QUALITATIVE METHODS. THIS STUDY REPORTS QUALITATIVE PERSPECTIVES OF FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADE PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR TEACHERS OF A 16-WEEK SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PROGRAM IN THREE PUBLIC SCHOOLS SERVING LOW-INCOME URBAN COMMUNITIES. FOUR THEMES RELATED TO PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS EMERGED: PROGRAM DELIVERY FACTORS, PROGRAM BUY-IN, IMPLEMENTER COMMUNICATION WITH TEACHERS, AND INSTRUCTOR QUALITIES. FEEDBACK FROM STUDENTS AND TEACHERS IS DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT OF INFORMING IMPLEMENTATION, ADAPTATION, AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PROGRAMMING IN URBAN SETTINGS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
14 2417 18 YOGA AND MEDITATION, AN ESSENTIAL TOOL TO ALLEVIATE STRESS AND ENHANCE IMMUNITY TO EMERGING INFECTIONS: A PERSPECTIVE ON THE EFFECT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC ON STUDENTS. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC CAUSED BY THE SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME CORONAVIRUS-2 (SARS-COV-2) HAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE GLOBAL HEALTHCARE AND ECONOMIC SYSTEMS WORLDWIDE. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS ALSO CREATED AN EMOTIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PANDEMIC AMONG PEOPLE OF ALL AGES IRRESPECTIVE OF ECONOMIC STATUS AND PHYSICAL WELLBEING. AS A CONSEQUENCE OF PROLONGED LOCKDOWNS, ONE OF THE MOST SEVERELY AFFECTED AGE GROUPS GLOBALLY IS THE YOUNG ADULTS' GROUP, ESPECIALLY STUDENTS. UNCERTAINTIES IN THE ACADEMIC CALENDAR, RESTRICTED OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES, AND UNUSUAL DAILY ROUTINES DURING LOCKDOWNS LED TO HIGHER INCIDENCES OF STRESS, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION AMONG STUDENTS WORLDWIDE. IN THIS REVIEW, WE SUMMARISE THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECT OF LOCKDOWNS ON STUDENTS AND DISCUSS POSSIBLE POSITIVE IMPACTS OF YOGA AND MEDITATION ON VARIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL, EMOTIONAL, AND IMMUNOLOGICAL PARAMETERS, WHICH CAN SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE THE GENERAL WELLBEING AND ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE OF STUDENTS. PERSPECTIVES SHARED IN THE REVIEW WILL ALSO BRING AWARENESS ON HOW YOGA AND MEDITATION COULD BOOST STUDENTS' PERFORMANCE AND ASSIST THEM IN MAINTAINING PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WELLBEING DURING STRESSFUL CONDITIONS SUCH AS FUTURE EPIDEMICS AND PANDEMICS WITH NOVEL INFECTIONS. THIS INFORMATION COULD HELP CREATE BETTER EDUCATIONAL CURRICULUMS AND HEALTHY ROUTINES FOR STUDENTS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
15   19 24 "WE REALLY NEED THIS": TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA FOR VETERAN WOMEN WITH A HISTORY OF MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA. OBJECTIVES: UP TO 70% OF WOMEN SERVICE MEMBERS IN THE UNITED STATES REPORT MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA (MST); MANY DEVELOP POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) AND CO-OCCURRING DISORDERS. TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA (TIY) IS SUGGESTED TO IMPROVE PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS AND SHOWN FEASIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE IN EMERGING RESEARCH, YET NO WORK HAS EVALUATED TIY IN MST SURVIVORS. THE CURRENT QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT AIMED TO EXAMINE TIY'S FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND PERCEIVED EFFECTS IN THE CONTEXT OF MST. DESIGN: COLLECTIVE CASE SERIES (N = 7). SETTING: NEW ENGLAND VET CENTER. INTERVENTIONS: EXTANT TIY PROGRAM (MINDFUL YOGA THERAPY) ADAPTED FOR VETERAN WOMEN WITH MST IN CONCURRENT PSYCHOTHERAPY. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ATTRITION AND ATTENDANCE; QUALITATIVE EXIT INTERVIEW; VALIDATED SELF-REPORT MEASURE OF NEGATIVE AFFECT PRE/POST EACH YOGA CLASS, AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY ASSESSMENTS AND SURVEYS BEFORE (T1; TIME 1) AND AFTER THE YOGA PROGRAM (T2; TIME 2). RESULTS: FEASIBILITY WAS DEMONSTRATED AND WOMEN REPORTED TIY WAS ACCEPTABLE. IN QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS, WOMEN REPORTED IMPROVED SYMPTOM SEVERITY, DIET, EXERCISE, ALCOHOL USE, SLEEP, AND PAIN; REDUCED MEDICATION USE; AND THEMES RELATED TO STRESS REDUCTION, MINDFULNESS, AND SELF-COMPASSION. REGARDING QUANTITATIVE CHANGE, RESULTS SUGGEST ACUTE REDUCTIONS IN NEGATIVE AFFECT FOLLOWING YOGA SESSIONS ACROSS PARTICIPANTS, AS WELL AS IMPROVED AFFECT DYSREGULATION, SHAME, AND MINDFULNESS T1 TO T2. CONCLUSIONS: TIY IS BOTH FEASIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE TO VETERAN WOMEN MST SURVIVORS IN ONE SPECIFIC VET CENTER, WITH PERCEIVED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BENEFITS. RESULTS SUGGEST TIY MAY TARGET PSYCHOSOCIAL MECHANISMS IMPLICATED IN HEALTH BEHAVIOR CHANGE (STRESS REDUCTION, MINDFULNESS, AFFECT REGULATION, SHAME). FORMAL RESEARCH SHOULD BE CONDUCTED TO CONFIRM THESE QI PROJECT RESULTS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
16 2312 27 TRAUMA SENSITIVE YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER: A QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS. RESEARCH ON POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AND CHRONIC CHILDHOOD ABUSE HAS REVEALED THAT TRADITIONAL TRAUMA TREATMENTS OFTEN FAIL TO FULLY ADDRESS THE COMPLICATED SYMPTOM PRESENTATION, INCLUDING THE SOMATIC COMPLAINTS, LOSS OF AWARENESS OF ONE'S EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL BEING IN THE PRESENT MOMENT, AND OVERALL LACK OF INTEGRATION BETWEEN THE SELF AND THE BODY. THE MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTION OF HATHA YOGA SHOWS PROMISE AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT, AND FOCUSES ON PERSONAL GROWTH IN ADDITION TO SYMPTOM REDUCTION. THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY EXPLORED THE EXPERIENCES OF THIRTY-ONE ADULT WOMEN WITH PTSD RELATED TO CHRONIC CHILDHOOD TRAUMA WHO PARTICIPATED IN A 10-WEEK TRAUMA SENSITIVE YOGA CLASS, SPECIFICALLY EXAMINING PERCEIVED CHANGES IN SYMPTOMS AND PERSONAL GROWTH.

RESULTS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH AND CLINICAL WORK ARE PRESENTED.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
17   14 29 "NOW I SEE A BRIGHTER DAY": EXPECTATIONS AND PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF AN IYENGAR YOGA INTERVENTION FOR YOUNG PATIENTS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA) IS A CHRONIC DISEASE CHARACTERIZED BY INFLAMMATION OF JOINTS AND ASSOCIATED FATIGUE, DETERIORATED RANGE OF MOTION, AND IMPAIRED PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING. YOUNG ADULTS WITH RA ARE AT A PARTICULAR RISK FOR COMPROMISED HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, AND THERE IS A NEED FOR SAFE, EFFECTIVE COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT IN ADDITION TO TRADITIONAL MEDICAL APPROACHES. THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO USE FACE-TO-FACE PARTICIPANT INTERVIEWS, CONDUCTED BEFORE AND AFTER AN IYENGAR YOGA (IY) PROGRAM, TO EXAMINE MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH YOGA MAY BE BENEFICIAL TO YOUNG ADULTS WITH RA.THIS PILOT STUDY UTILIZED A SINGLE-ARM DESIGN WHERE ALL PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED THE INTERVENTION. CLASSES WERE TAUGHT TWICE PER WEEK (1.5 HOURS EACH) FOR 6 WEEKS BY AN IY TEACHER QUALIFIED IN THERAPEUTICS. INTERVIEW THEMES INCLUDED PARTICIPANTS' BASELINE EXPECTATIONS ABOUT YOGA AND VIEWPOINTS AS TO HOW THEIR FUNCTIONING HAD BEEN IMPACTED BY THE IY INTERVENTION WERE EXAMINED. FIVE YOUNG ADULTS WITH RA AGED 24-31 YEARS (MEAN = 28; 80% FEMALE) COMPLETED THE YOGA INTERVENTION. PARTICIPANTS CONSISTENTLY REPORTED THAT YOGA HELPED WITH ENERGY, RELAXATION AND MOOD AND THEY DISCUSSED PERCEIVED MECHANISMS FOR HOW YOGA IMPACTED WELL-BEING. MECHANISMS INCLUDED PHYSICAL CHANGES SUCH AS RANGE OF MOTION AND PHYSIOLOGICAL AWARENESS, AND PSYCHOSPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENTS SUCH AS ACCEPTANCE, COPING, SELF-EFFICACY AND MINDFULNESS. THOUGH THE STUDY IS LIMITED, PARTICIPANTS' RESPONSES PROVIDE COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT IY FOR RA PATIENTS IS AN INTERVENTION WORTHY OF FURTHER EXPLORATION. THE MECHANISMS AND OUTCOMES REPORTED BY PARTICIPANTS SUPPORT A BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL MODEL, WHICH PROPOSES THAT YOGA BENEFITS PATIENTS THROUGH BOTH PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOSPIRITUAL CHANGES.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
18 1428 27 IMPROVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING FOLLOWING A BRIEF YOGA-BASED PROGRAM FOR EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS WHO ATTENDED A YOGA-BASED PROGRAM. METHODS: EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS WHO ATTENDED A 3-DAY YOGA-BASED RISE (RESILIENCE, INTEGRATION, SELF-AWARENESS, ENGAGEMENT) PROGRAM WERE RECRUITED TO PARTICIPATE. RISE WAS ADMINISTERED AT THE KRIPALU CENTER FOR YOGA & HEALTH. MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING, AND HEALTH-RELATED BEHAVIORS WERE COMPLETED BEFORE (BASELINE), AFTER (POST), AND 2 MONTHS AFTER RISE (FOLLOW-UP). FORTY-FOUR PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED BASELINE AND POST AND WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. OF THOSE, 33 PARTICIPANTS ALSO COMPLETED THE FOLLOW-UP. PAIRED SAMPLES T TESTS WERE USED TO COMPARE SCORES BETWEEN TIME POINTS. RESULTS: COMPARED TO BASELINE, AT POST, PARTICIPANTS SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS IN PERCEIVED STRESS, MINDFULNESS, EMPOWERMENT, POSITIVE AFFECT, NEGATIVE AFFECT, SELF-COMPASSION, TOTAL WORK ENGAGEMENT, VIGOR, SLEEP QUALITY (ALL P VALUES < .001), RESILIENCE, SATISFACTION WITH LIFE, AS WELL AS EXHAUSTION AND PROFESSIONAL EFFICACY WHICH ARE DIMENSIONS OF BURNOUT (ALL P VALUES < .01). AT THE FOLLOW-UP, SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE MAINTAINED FOR MINDFULNESS, EMPOWERMENT, SELF-COMPASSION, SLEEP QUALITY (ALL P VALUES < .001), RESILIENCE, VIGOR, AND EXHAUSTION (ALL P VALUES < .01) AND POSITIVE AFFECT, SATISFACTION WITH LIFE, AND WORK ENGAGEMENT (ALL P VALUES < .05). CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE YOGA-BASED RISE PROGRAM IMPROVES PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS. IN ADDITION, PARTICIPANTS REPORTED THAT ATTENDING RISE WAS FEASIBLE, THEY COULD CONTINUE USING RISE PRACTICES LONG-TERM, SHARED THEM WITH WORK COLLEAGUES, AND REPORTED THAT RISE POSITIVELY IMPACTED BOTH THEIR DAILY LIVES AND WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT. WITH THESE PROMISING RESULTS, ADDITIONAL CONTROLLED RESEARCH IS WARRANTED.	2019	
                                                                                                      
19 2574 26 YOGA FOR EVERYONE: A QUALITATIVE STUDY OF A COMMUNITY YOGA CLASS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITY. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: PEOPLE WITH MOBILITY IMPAIRMENTS FACE INCREASED BARRIERS TO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. THE STUDY AIMED TO UNDERSTAND THE LIVED EXPERIENCES OF INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITY WHO ARE REGULAR PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA FOR EVERYONE CLASS TO INFORM FUTURE RESEARCH, INTERVENTION AND COMMUNITY PROGRAMS.METHODS: A PHENOMENOLOGICAL QUALITATIVE APPROACH UTILIZED SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS AND CLASS OBSERVATIONS. DATA WAS ANALYZED THROUGH ITERATIVE INDUCTIVE THEMATIC ANALYSIS.RESULTS: SIX PEOPLE OF VARIED MOBILITY LIMITATIONS PARTICIPATED. THEMATIC ANALYSIS REVEALED THEMES ON INFLUENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND PERSONAL FACTORS, A HOLISTIC-FOCUSED CLASS ENVIRONMENT, PHYSICAL IMPROVEMENTS, MENTAL/EMOTIONAL IMPACT, AND A SENSE OF BELONGING TO COMMUNITY.CONCLUSION: THE YOGA FOR EVERYONE CLASS FOSTERED MULTI-FACETED OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE WITH DIVERSE MOVEMENT IMPAIRMENTS. FOCUSING ON COMMUNITY-CLINICAL PARTNERSHIPS, UTILIZING A CLASS STRUCTURE WITH VOLUNTEERS, AND FOSTERING AN ONGOING INCLUSIVE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT ARE POTENTIAL STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS IN OTHER COMMUNITY PROGRAMS FOR THOSE WITH DISABILITY.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
20 1842 33 QUALITATIVE EVALUATION OF A COMMUNITY-BASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND YOGA PROGRAM FOR MEN LIVING WITH PROSTATE CANCER: SURVIVOR PERSPECTIVES. PURPOSE: PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (PA) PROGRAMS FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON MANY ASPECTS OF HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE. TRANSLATING THIS RESEARCH INTO SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY-BASED SETTINGS IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE ACCESS TO PROGRAMS FOR SURVIVORS. THIS STUDY EXAMINES PATIENT PERSPECTIVES IN THE COMMUNITY-BASED TRUENTH LIFESTYLE MANAGEMENT (TRUENTH LM) PROGRAM IN CALGARY, CANADA. METHODS: ELEVEN MEN FROM PROGRAMS AT CIVIC WELLNESS CENTERS PARTICIPATED IN 2 SMALL SEMISTRUCTURED FOCUS GROUPS (N = 5 AND 6) AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY. MOTIVATION FOR PROGRAM INITIATION AND ADHERENCE, BENEFITS AND BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATION, AND INDIVIDUAL SATISFACTION AND FEEDBACK ON PROGRAM IMPROVEMENT WERE DISCUSSED. AUDIO RECORDINGS WERE TRANSCRIBED AND ANALYZED USING THEMATIC METHODOLOGY GUIDED BY A PRAGMATIC PHILOSOPHY ON THE PATIENT EXPERIENCE IN THE PROGRAM. RESULTS: THEMES IDENTIFIED INCLUDED PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF PARTICIPATING (PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND SOCIAL), FACILITATORS FOR INVOLVEMENT IN THE PA PROGRAM (PROGRAM DESIGN, INITIAL FREE ACCESS, TAILORED TO PROSTATE CANCER SPECIFIC NEEDS, PSYCHOSOCIAL ENVIRONMENT), AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY (EXERCISE AS A PART OF STANDARD CARE, COST STRUCTURE, HOME-BASED OPTIONS). CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS PROVIDE VALUABLE INSIGHT INTO PATIENT PERSPECTIVES ON EFFECTIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF PROSTATE CANCER AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS. TRUENTH LM HAS IMPLEMENTED FINDINGS, AND ENSURING NEEDS (BENEFITS AND BARRIERS) ARE ADDRESSED FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS WHEN ENTERING COMMUNITY-BASED PA PROGRAMS.	2019

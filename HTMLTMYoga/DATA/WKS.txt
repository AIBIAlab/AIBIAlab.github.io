1 1207 146 EXPERIENCES OF WOMEN WHO PARTICIPATED IN A BETA-TEST FOR AN ONLINE-STREAMED YOGA INTERVENTION AFTER A STILLBIRTH. BACKGROUND: LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW TO BEST CARE FOR MOTHERS AFTER STILLBIRTH. AS SUCH, THIS PAPER WILL REPORT THE SATISFACTION AND PERCEPTIONS OF AN ONLINE YOGA INTERVENTION (12-WEEK BETA TEST) IN WOMEN AFTER STILLBIRTH. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS (N=74) HAD A STILLBIRTH WITHIN THE LAST 24-MONTHS (M TIME SINCE LOSS 9.65 +/- 6.9 MONTHS). POST-INTERVENTION SATISFACTION SURVEYS AND INTERVIEWS AND DROPOUT SURVEYS WERE CONDUCTED. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS WERE USED TO ANALYZE SURVEY RESPONSES AND DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION. A PHENOMENOLOGICAL APPROACH WAS USED TO EXPLORE AND UNDERSTAND UNIQUE EXPERIENCES OF PARTICIPANT INTERVIEWS. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING NVIVO10. RESULTS: TWENTY-SIX WOMEN (M AGE 33.73 +/- 4.38) WERE COMPLETERS (> 3 WKS OF YOGA), 26 (M AGE 31.82 +/- 4.13) WERE NON-COMPLETERS (< 3 WKS OF YOGA), AND 22 (M AGE 32.94 +/- 2.93) DROPPED OUT. TWENTY COMPLETERS PARTICIPATED IN A POST-INTERVENTION SATISFACTION SURVEY WITH 75% (N=15) REPORTING BEING VERY SATISFIED OR SATISFIED WITH THE ONLINE YOGA INTERVENTION, FOUND IT TO BE VERY ENJOYABLE OR ENJOYABLE, AND VERY HELPFUL OR HELPFUL TO COPE WITH GRIEF. SATISFACTION AND PERCEPTIONS OF THE INTERVENTION IN THOSE WHO COMPLETED AN INTERVIEW (N=12) WERE CLUSTERED AROUND THE FOLLOWING THEMES: BENEFITS, BARRIERS, DISLIKES, SATISFACTION, AND PREFERENCES. OF THE 22 DROPOUTS, 14 COMPLETED A DROPOUT SURVEY. WOMEN WITHDREW FROM THE STUDY DUE TO PREGNANCY (N=3, 21%), BURDEN (N=3, 21%), STRESS (N=2, 14%), LACK OF TIME (N=2, 14%), DID NOT ENJOY (N=1, 7%), AND OTHER (N=3, 21%). CONCLUSION: FINDINGS HERE MAY BE USED TO HELP DESIGN FUTURE RESEARCH.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
2 2095  23 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ASANA "VRKSASANA (TREE POSE)" ON BALANCE IN PATIENTS WITH POSTMENOPAUSAL OSTEOPOROSIS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: IN THIS STUDY, THE EFFECT OF THE ADD-ON EFFECT OF THE TREE POSE (VRKSASANA) ON THE BALANCE OF PATIENTS WITH POSTMENOPAUSAL OSTEOPOROSIS WAS INVESTIGATED. DESIGN: THIRTY-TWO PATIENTS WITH POSTMENOPAUSAL OSTEOPOROSIS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO CONSERVATIVE EXERCISE GROUP (30 MINS/D FOR 12 WKS) OR TREE POSE-ADDED EXERCISE GROUP (30-MIN CONVENTIONAL EXERCISE + 2-MIN TREE POSE/D FOR 12 WKS) BY MICROSOFT EXCEL RANDOMIZATION OPTION. THE BALANCE OF THE PATIENTS WAS EVALUATED WITH BERG BALANCE SCALE, TIMED UP AND GO TEST, SINGLE-LEG STANDING TEST, TANDEM WALK TEST, TANDEM STANCE TEST, AND KOREBALANCE STATIC&DYNAMIC BALANCE TESTS AT BASELINE, SIXTH WEEK, AND THIRD MONTH OF THE EXERCISE PROGRAM. RESULTS: THERE WAS NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE ON BASELINE DATA BETWEEN GROUPS. THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS IN THE SIXTH-WEEK MEASUREMENT OF SINGLE-LEG STANCE (P < 0.05). IN THE BERG BALANCE SCALE, STATIC BALANCE TEST, DYNAMIC BALANCE TEST, AND TANDEM WALK TEST, A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND AMONG BASELINE, SIXTH-WEEK, AND 12TH WEEK MEASUREMENTS IN BOTH THE EXERCISE GROUP AND THE TREE POSE-ADDED EXERCISE GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: GAINS IN THE STATIC AND DYNAMIC BALANCE OF POSTMENOPAUSAL OSTEOPOROTIC PATIENTS CAN BE OBTAINED BY ADDING "VRKSASANA" TO CONVENTIONAL EXERCISES.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
3  942  22 EFFECTS OF 8-WEEK HATHA YOGA TRAINING ON METABOLIC AND INFLAMMATORY MARKERS IN HEALTHY, FEMALE CHINESE SUBJECTS: A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. WE AIMED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF AN 8 WK HATHA YOGA TRAINING ON BLOOD GLUCOSE, INSULIN, LIPID PROFILES, ENDOTHELIAL MICROPARTICLES (EMPS), AND INFLAMMATORY STATUS IN HEALTHY, LEAN, AND FEMALE CHINESE SUBJECTS. A TOTAL OF 30 HEALTHY, FEMALE CHINESE SUBJECTS WERE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED INTO CONTROL OR YOGA PRACTICE GROUP. THE YOGA PRACTICE INCLUDED 8 WKS OF YOGA PRACTICE (2 TIMES/WK) FOR A TOTAL OF 16 TIMES. FASTING BLOOD SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA TRAINING. PLASMA WAS ISOLATED FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF LIPID PROFILES, GLUCOSE, INSULIN, EMPS, AND INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES. WHOLE BLOOD WAS CULTURED EX VIVO AND STIMULATED WITH LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE (LPS) AND PAM3CYS-SK4. PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS (PBMCS) WERE ISOLATED FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF TLR2 AND TLR4 PROTEIN EXPRESSION. YOGA PRACTICE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED PLASMA CHOLESTEROL, LDL-CHOLESTEROL, INSULIN LEVELS, AND CD31+/CD42B- EMPS. CULTURED WHOLE BLOOD FROM THE YOGA GROUP HAS REDUCED PROINFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES SECRETION BOTH AT UNSTIMULATED CONDITION AND WHEN STIMULATED WITH PAM3CYS-SK4; THIS MIGHT BE ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED TLR2 PROTEIN EXPRESSION IN PBMCS AFTER YOGA TRAINING. HATHA YOGA PRACTICE IN HEALTHY CHINESE FEMALE SUBJECTS COULD IMPROVE HALLMARKS RELATED TO METS; THUS IT CAN BE CONSIDERED AS AN ANCILLARY INTERVENTION IN THE PRIMARY METS PREVENTION FOR THE HEALTHY POPULATION. THIS TRIAL IS REGISTERED WITH CHICTR-IOR-14005747.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
4 2790  19 YOGA THERAPY FOR ANXIETY: A CASE REPORT. YOGA THERAPY IS A MIND-BODY INTERVENTION THAT CAN BE AN IMPORTANT SOLUTION IN THE TREATMENT OF ANXIETY. YOGA THERAPY ALLEVIATES THE HYPERAROUSAL OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM (SNS) AND THE HYPERVIGILANCE OF THE HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-ADRENAL (HPA) AXIS THAT OCCURS IN ANXIETY. YOGA THERAPY ACTIVATES THE PARASYMPATHETIC BRANCH OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM, REPLACING SNS OVERDRIVE, OR THE FLIGHT-OR-FIGHT RESPONSE, WITH THE RELAXATION RESPONSE AND BALANCING THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. YOGA THERAPY INCREASES POSITIVE COPING SKILLS AND BUILDS SELF-ESTEEM WITHOUT HARMFUL SIDE EFFECTS. THE RESULTS OF THIS CASE STUDY HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE CLINICAL EFFICACY OF YOGA THERAPY IN THE TREATMENT OF ANXIETY AND PANIC DISORDER (PD) IN AN ADOLESCENT FEMALE. TREATMENT CONSISTED OF 4 WKS OF INDIVIDUAL SESSIONS (60-MIN SESSION/WK) AND 6 WKS OF GROUP SESSIONS (90-MIN SESSION/WK) WITH DAILY HOME PRACTICE. THE RESULTS OF THE CASE STUDY ARE SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE GROWING NUMBERS OF YOUTH IN THE UNITED STATES ARE PRESENTING WITH ANXIETY AND SEEKING NONPHARMACOLOGICAL OPTIONS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
5 1083  31 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS AMONG HEALTHY ADULTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. BACKGROUND: YOGA WAS RECOMMENDED IN BOTH CLINICAL AND NONCLINICAL POPULATIONS AS THERAPY METHODS. THE DIVERSITY OF YOGA PRACTICE AS A THERAPY METHOD HAS RARELY BEEN DISCUSSED AND IT IS ESSENTIAL TO ADDRESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS. PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVE: THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF YOGA ON STRESS IN HEALTHY POPULATION. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE AUTHORS INTENDED TO FIGURE OUT YOGA EFFECTS ON STRESS SYSTEMATICALLY. METHODS/DESIGN: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY ARTICLES THAT ASSESS THE EFFECT OF YOGA AND YOGA-RELATED INTERVENTIONS ON STRESS REDUCTION IN NONCLINICAL POPULATIONS. STUDIES WERE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE LENGTH OF THE INTERVENTION, YOGA TYPE, AND MEASURES OF OUTCOME. THE STUDIES WERE SELECTED THROUGHOUT LAST 5 YEARS (JANUARY 2014 TO NOVEMBER 2018) BY USING THE KEY SEARCHING TERM YOGA AND STRESS INCORPORATION WITH TENSION AND PRESSURE. THE SELECTION PROCESS FOLLOWED THE PRISMA FLOW DIAGRAM. RESULTS: TOTALLY, 12 ARTICLES ELABORATING ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA OR YOGA-RELATED INTERVENTIONS ON STRESS MANAGEMENT AND REMISSION WERE INCLUDED IN THE REVIEW. THIS REVIEW INCLUDED VARIOUS TYPES OF YOGA PRACTICE (E.G., HATHA YOGA, BIKRAM YOGA, KUNDALINI YOGA, SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA, KRIPALU YOGA, YIN YOGA). A TIME SPECTRUM WAS CONDUCTED FROM 4 WKS TO 28 WKS. THIS REVIEW REVEALED THAT MOST TYPES OF YOGA HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON STRESS REDUCTION IN HEATHY POPULATIONS. CONCLUSION: FURTHER STUDIES ARE RECOMMENDED TO EXAMINE THE LONG-TERM EFFECT OF YOGA AND UNDERLYING PSYCHOLOGICAL MECHANISMS CAUSING STRESS AND MENTAL RESTRAIN. IN ADDITION, IT IS SUGGESTED TO CONSIDER AGE AS A RISK FACTOR AFFECTING THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON STRESS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
6 2241  26 THE INFLUENCE OF HATHA YOGA AS AN ADD-ON TREATMENT IN MAJOR DEPRESSION ON HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-ADRENAL-AXIS ACTIVITY: A RANDOMIZED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: THE IMPACT OF HATHA YOGA AS ADD-ON TREATMENT TO QUETIAPINE FUMARATE EXTENDED RELEASE (QXR) OR ESCITALOPRAM (ESC) IN DEPRESSED PATIENTS ON HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-ADRENAL (HPA) AXIS ACTIVITY WAS ASSESSED. METHODS: 60 INPATIENTS SUFFERING FROM MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD) ACCORDING TO DSM-IV WERE RANDOMIZED FOR A 5 WEEK TREATMENT WITH YOGA OR NOT (CONTROL GROUP) AND WITH EITHER QXR (300 MG/DAY) OR ESC (10 MG/DAY). SERIAL DEXAMETHASONE/CORTICOTROPIN RELEASING HORMONE (DEX/CRH) TESTS WERE PERFORMED TO ASSESS HPA AXIS FUNCTION. THE HAMILTON DEPRESSION RATING SCALE (21-HAMD) WAS USED WEEKLY. RESULTS: A MORE PRONOUNCED DOWN REGULATION OF THE HPA AXIS ACTIVITY DUE TO YOGA COULD NOT BE DETECTED. THE STEPWISE LONG TERM CORTISOL REDUCTION WAS SEEN IN BOTH MEDICATION GROUPS, IRRESPECTIVELY OF YOGA ADD-ON TREATMENT. IN ADDITION, CORTISOL IMPROVERS IN WEEK 1 OF THERAPY (REDUCTION IN CORTISOL PEAK VALUE WITHIN THE DEX/CRH TEST) REACHED SIGNIFICANT GREATER AMELIORATION OF DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AFTER 5 WEEKS. CONCLUSIONS: OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ANTIDEPRESSANT AGENTS DOWN REGULATE HPA AXIS FUNCTION TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN ADDITIONAL HATHA YOGA TREATMENT. MOREOVER, AN EARLY REDUCTION OF HPA SYSTEM HYPERACTIVITY AFTER ONE WEEK OF PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT SEEMS TO RAISE THE POSSIBILITY OF A FAVORABLE TREATMENT RESPONSE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
7  264  18 ACUTE CHEST PAIN AND ESOPHAGEAL MUCOSAL INJURY FOLLOWING AN EXTREME YOGA POSITION CASE REPORT. A YOUNG LADY COMPLAINED OF THE SUDDEN ONSET OF INTENSE CHEST PAIN, IN CONSEQUENCE OF AN EXTREME HYPEREXTENSION OF THE BACK IN A YOGA POSITION. AT ENDOSCOPY A LARGE LESION OF THE ESOPHAGEAL EPITHELIUM WAS DETECTED, INVOLVING THE MIDDLE THIRD OF THE ANTERIOR WALL OF THE ESOPHAGUS. OTHER SYMPTOMS REPORTED BY THE PATIENT WERE DYSPHAGIA AND ODYNOPHAGIA, DEPICTING THE TYPICAL FEATURES OF INTRAMURAL HEMATOMA, ALSO KNOWN AS INTRAMURAL DISSECTION OR INTRAMURAL PERFORATION OF THE OESOPHAGUS. THE PATIENT WAS MANAGED CONSERVATIVELY AND SYMPTOMS DISAPPEARED WITHIN A WEEK. A BARIUM SWALLOW AT SIX MONTHS REPORTED NORMAL FINDINGS. DIFFERENT TYPES OF ACCIDENTS OCCURRING DURING YOGA PRACTICE ARE REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE, MAINLY INVOLVING MUSCULOSKELETAL OR NERVOUS SYSTEMS. VISCERAL LESIONS ARE EXCEPTIONAL AND NO SIMILAR CASES HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN THE LITERATURE.

8 1603  16 MENTAL DEPRESSION AND KUNDALINI YOGA. IN CASES OF MENTAL DEPRESSION, THE PLASMA SEROTONIN, MELATONIN AND GLUTAMATE LEVELS ARE INCREASED ALONG WITH THE LOWERING OF URINARY - 5 - HYDROXYINDOLE ACETIC ACID, PLASMA MONOAMINE OXIDASE AND CORTISOL LEVELS FOLLOWING THREE AND SIX MONTHS PRACTICE OF KUNDALINI YOGA. THE PULSE RATE AND BLOOD PRESSURE IN THESE PATIENTS ARE ALSO LOWERED AFTER KUNDALINI YOGA PRACTICE. THUS, THE PRACTICE OF KUNDALINI YOGA HELPS TO MAINTAIN A PERFECT HOMEOSTASIS BY BRINGING AN EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN THE SYMPATHETIC AND PARASYMPATHETIC ACTIVITIES AND IT CAN BE USED AS A NON - MEDICAL MEASURE IN TREATING PATIENTS WITH MENTAL DEPRESSION.	1986

KNEE REPLACEMENT SURGERIES ARE BEING DONE INCREASINGLY IN THE PRESENT TIMES. THIS HAS LED TO THE VIOLATION OF THE STANDARD INDICATIONS AND WHEN KNEES ARE REPLACED IGNORING OTHER CO - MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS IT RESULTS IN THE SURGERY FAILING EARLY. THIS IS ABOUT A PATIENT WHO ENCOUNTERED A FAILED TKR DUE TO IMPROPER SELECTION AS PATIENT HAD BILATERAL OA HIP THAT WAS IGNORED IN THE INITIAL STAGES. TO OVERCOME THE PROBLEM SHE WAS ADVISED BILATERAL HIP REPLACEMENT WHICH WOULD LEAVE HER WITH FOUR REPLACEMENTS IN THE LOWER LIMB. SHE REFUSED SURGERY AND WAS TOLD THERE ARE NO ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS. THIS PATIENT UNDERWENT A 3 WEEK INTEGRATED COURSE OF IAYT AT OUR CENTER AND SHE MADE A REMARKABLE RECOVERY. IAYT IS A GOOD NON-SURGICAL TREATMENT THAT CAN BE AFFECTIVE BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER KNEE REPLACEMENT AND IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS THE FIRST CHOICE OF TREATMENT BEFORE SURGERY.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
10 2911  20 [PSEUDOARTHROSIS OF THE FIRST RIB IN A PATIENT WHO PRACTICES YOGA. A CASE REPORT]. INTRODUCTION: PSEUDOARTHROSIS OF THE FIRST RIB IS A RARE CONDITION THAT MAY OCCUR IN ATHLETES AS A RESULT OF REPETITIVE ACTIVITIES, MAINLY OVERHEAD. THE USUAL CLINICAL PRESENTATION IS PAIN IN THE NECK OR THE IPSILATERAL SHOULDER. CASE REPORT: THIS IS THE CASE OF A 19-YEAR-OLD FEMALE PATIENT WHO HAD SUDDEN PAIN OF THE BASE OF THE NECK WHILE DOING YOGA. PSEUDOARTHROSIS OF THE FIRST RIB WAS DIAGNOSED WITH X-RAYS AND CAT SCAN. TREATMENT CONSISTED OF A REHABILITATION AND PHYSICAL THERAPY PROGRAM THAT WAS SUCCESSFUL DESPITE THE PERSISTENCE OF THE PSEUDOARTHROSIS. DISCUSSION: CASES OF FIRST RIB FRACTURES HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN ATHLETES PRACTICING MULTIPLE ACTIVITIES; HOWEVER, PSEUDOARTHROSIS CASES ARE RARE SINCE MOST OF THEM PROGRESS TO BONE HEALING. THIS IS THE FIRST REPORTED CASE OF A FRACTURE OR PSEUDOARTHROSIS IN A PATIENT PRACTICING YOGA. AS IN MOST REPORTED CASES, CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT WAS SUCCESSFUL. CONCLUSION: FRACTURES AND PSEUDOARTHROSIS OF THE FIRST RIB ARE RARE IN ATHLETES AND SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF ATHLETES PRESENTING WITH SHOULDER AND NECK PAIN. CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT IS SUCCESSFUL IN MOST CASES.	2009

13  839  21 EFFECT OF YOGA ON PLASMA GLUCOSE, LIPID PROFILE, BLOOD PRESSURE AND INSULIN REQUIREMENT IN A PATIENT WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES MELLITUS. OBJECTIVES: THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY IS TO EVALUATE THE SHORT-TERM EFFECT OF YOGA ON PLASMA GLUCOSE, LIPID PROFILE, BLOOD PRESSURE AND INSULIN REQUIREMENT IN A PATIENT WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES MELLITUS (T1DM). CASE PRESENTATION: A 28-YEARS OLD FEMALE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH T1DM AT THE AGE OF SEVEN. SHE WAS UNDER HUMAN MIXTARD INSULIN 30-70, THRICE/DAY FOR 15-15-15 UNITS. SHE HAD A HISTORY OF POOR GLYCEMIC CONTROL, DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS AND HYPOGLYCEMIC SHOCK. AT THE AGE OF 27, SHE GOT ADMITTED WITH COMPLAINTS OF GENERAL WEAKNESS, JOINTS STIFFNESS AND WEIGHT LOSS IN OUR HOLISTIC HEALTH CENTRE AND UNDERWENT TWO WEEKS OF YOGA. RESULTS SHOWED A BETTER REDUCTION IN THE PLASMA GLUCOSE LEVELS, LIPID PROFILE, BLOOD PRESSURE AND INSULIN DOSE AND AN INCREASE IN HEMOGLOBIN LEVELS WITH NO EPISODES OF HYPOGLYCEMIA AFTER YOGA. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA MIGHT BE CONSIDERED AS A SAFER AND EFFECTIVE ADJUVANT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF T1DM.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
14 1615  15 MIND-BODY PRACTICES AND THE SELF: YOGA AND MEDITATION DO NOT QUIET THE EGO BUT INSTEAD BOOST SELF-ENHANCEMENT. MIND-BODY PRACTICES ENJOY IMMENSE PUBLIC AND SCIENTIFIC INTEREST. YOGA AND MEDITATION ARE HIGHLY POPULAR. PURPORTEDLY, THEY FOSTER WELL-BEING BY CURTAILING SELF-ENHANCEMENT BIAS. HOWEVER, THIS "EGO-QUIETING" EFFECT CONTRADICTS AN APPARENT PSYCHOLOGICAL UNIVERSAL, THE SELF-CENTRALITY PRINCIPLE. ACCORDING TO THIS PRINCIPLE, PRACTICING ANY SKILL RENDERS THAT SKILL SELF-CENTRAL, AND SELF-CENTRALITY BREEDS SELF-ENHANCEMENT BIAS. WE EXAMINED THOSE OPPOSING PREDICTIONS IN THE FIRST TESTS OF MIND-BODY PRACTICES' SELF-ENHANCEMENT EFFECTS. IN EXPERIMENT 1, WE FOLLOWED 93 YOGA STUDENTS OVER 15 WEEKS, ASSESSING SELF-CENTRALITY AND SELF-ENHANCEMENT BIAS AFTER YOGA PRACTICE (YOGA CONDITION, N = 246) AND WITHOUT PRACTICE (CONTROL CONDITION, N = 231). IN EXPERIMENT 2, WE FOLLOWED 162 MEDITATORS OVER 4 WEEKS (MEDITATION CONDITION: N = 246; CONTROL CONDITION: N = 245). SELF-ENHANCEMENT BIAS WAS HIGHER IN THE YOGA (EXPERIMENT 1) AND MEDITATION (EXPERIMENT 2) CONDITIONS, AND THOSE EFFECTS WERE MEDIATED BY GREATER SELF-CENTRALITY. ADDITIONALLY, GREATER SELF-ENHANCEMENT BIAS MEDIATED MIND-BODY PRACTICES' WELL-BEING BENEFITS. EVIDENTLY, NEITHER YOGA NOR MEDITATION FULLY QUIET THE EGO; TO THE CONTRARY, THEY BOOST SELF-ENHANCEMENT.	2018

16 2324  22 TREATMENT OF ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION WITH YOGA RELAXATION THERAPY IN A USAF AVIATOR: A CASE REPORT. A 46-YEAR-OLD CAUCASIAN MALE USAF AVIATOR WITH A 6-YEAR HISTORY OF MILD ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION (MEDICAL WAIVER FOR FLIGHT DUTY) UNDER UNSUCCESSFUL TREATMENT WITH HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE, DIETARY MODIFICATION, AND EXERCISE, WAS SUBSEQUENTLY TRAINED IN YOGA RELAXATION. AFTER 6 WEEKS, MEDICATION HAD BEEN DISCONTINUED, AND HIS DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE REMAINED WITHIN NORMAL LEVELS. THE PATIENT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY RETURNED TO FULL FLIGHT STATUS WITHOUT RECURRENCE OF DIASTOLIC HYPERTENSION AT FOLLOWUP 6 MONTHS LATER. RELAXATION TRAINING, OF WHICH YOGA IS ONE TYPE, HAS BEEN REPORTED IN THE MEDICAL LITERATURE TO HAVE WIDE CLINICAL APPLICATION. IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A NONPHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPY ADJUNCT OR ALTERNATIVE FOR MEDICAL DISORDERS AMONG PERSONNEL IN OCCUPATIONS (E.G., AVIATION) WHERE THE SIDE EFFECTS FROM MEDICATIONS ARE OF GREAT CONCERN AND COULD BE DISQUALIFYING FROM THOSE DUTIES.	1989	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
17 1088  25 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SYMPTOMS, PHYSICAL FUNCTION, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES IN ADULTS WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS: A FOCUSED REVIEW. OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) IS A HIGHLY PREVALENT AND DISABLING CHRONIC CONDITION. BECAUSE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS A KEY COMPONENT IN OA MANAGEMENT, EFFECTIVE EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS ARE NEEDED. YOGA IS AN INCREASINGLY POPULAR MULTIMODAL MIND-BODY EXERCISE THAT AIMS TO PROMOTE FLEXIBILITY, STRENGTH, ENDURANCE, AND BALANCE. ITS GENTLE APPROACH IS POTENTIALLY A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE EXERCISE OPTION FOR MANAGING OA. THE PURPOSE OF THIS FOCUSED REVIEW IS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON OA SYMPTOMS AND PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES. A COMPREHENSIVE SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED USING SEVEN ELECTRONIC DATABASES. TWELVE REPORTS MET INCLUSION CRITERIA INVOLVING A TOTAL OF 589 PARTICIPANTS WITH OA-RELATED SYMPTOMS. A VARIETY OF TYPES, FREQUENCIES, AND DURATIONS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS WERE REPORTED; HATHA AND IYENGAR YOGA WERE THE MOST COMMONLY USED TYPES. FREQUENCY OF INTERVENTION RANGED FROM ONCE A WEEK TO 6 DAYS A WEEK. DURATION OF THE INTERVENTIONS RANGED FROM 45 TO 90 MINS PER SESSION FOR 6 TO 12 WKS. YOGA INTERVENTION RESULTED IN REDUCTIONS IN PAIN, STIFFNESS, AND SWELLING, BUT RESULTS ON PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL-BEING WERE INCONCLUSIVE BECAUSE OF A VARIETY OF OUTCOME MEASURES BEING USED.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
18 2771  16 YOGA REDUCES SYMPTOMS OF DISTRESS IN TSUNAMI SURVIVORS IN THE ANDAMAN ISLANDS. A MONTH AFTER THE DECEMBER 2004 TSUNAMI THE EFFECT OF A 1 WEEK YOGA PROGRAM WAS EVALUATED ON SELF RATED FEAR, ANXIETY, SADNESS AND DISTURBED SLEEP IN 47 SURVIVORS IN THE ANDAMAN ISLANDS. POLYGRAPH RECORDINGS OF THE HEART RATE, BREATH RATE AND SKIN RESISTANCE WERE ALSO MADE. AMONG THE 47 PEOPLE, 31 WERE SETTLERS FROM THE MAINLAND (I.E. INDIA, ML GROUP) AND 16 WERE ENDOGENOUS PEOPLE (EP GROUP). THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN SELF RATED FEAR, ANXIETY, SADNESS AND DISTURBED SLEEP IN BOTH GROUPS, AND IN THE HEART AND BREATH RATE IN THE ML GROUP, AND IN THE BREATH RATE ALONE IN THE EP GROUP, FOLLOWING YOGA (P < 0.05, T-TEST). THIS SUGGESTS THAT YOGA PRACTICE MAY BE USEFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF STRESS FOLLOWING A NATURAL DISASTER IN PEOPLE WITH WIDELY DIFFERING SOCIAL, CULTURAL AND SPIRITUAL BELIEFS.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
19 1984  29 SOFT TISSUE AND BONY INJURIES ATTRIBUTED TO THE PRACTICE OF YOGA: A BIOMECHANICAL ANALYSIS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR MANAGEMENT. OBJECTIVE: TO ANALYZE INJURIES THAT WERE DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA PRACTICE AND IDENTIFY SPECIFIC POSES THAT SHOULD BE AVOIDED IN PATIENTS WITH OSTEOPENIA OR OSTEOPOROSIS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: WE RETROSPECTIVELY REVIEWED THE MEDICAL RECORDS OF PATIENTS WITH INJURIES THAT WERE PRIMARILY CAUSED BY YOGA. PATIENTS WERE SEEN FROM JANUARY 1, 2006, THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2018. INJURIES WERE CATEGORIZED INTO 3 GROUPS: (1) SOFT TISSUE INJURY, (2) AXIAL NONBONY INJURY, AND (3) BONY INJURY. PATIENTS UNDERWENT EVALUATION AND WERE COUNSELED TO MODIFY EXERCISE ACTIVITY. RESULTS: WE IDENTIFIED 89 PATIENTS FOR INCLUSION IN THE STUDY. WITHIN THE SOFT TISSUE GROUP, 66 PATIENTS (74.2%) HAD MECHANICAL MYOFASCIAL PAIN DUE TO OVERUSE. ROTATOR CUFF INJURY WAS SEEN IN 6 (6.7%), AND TROCHANTERIC BURSOPATHY WAS OBSERVED IN 1 (1.1%). IN THE AXIAL GROUP, EXACERBATION OF PAIN IN DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASE (46 PATIENTS [51.7%]) AND FACET ARTHROPATHY (N=34 [38.2%]) WERE OBSERVED. RADICULOPATHY WAS SEEN IN 5 PATIENTS (5.6%). WITHIN THE BONY INJURY CATEGORY, KYPHOSCOLIOSIS WAS SEEN ON IMAGING IN 15 PATIENTS (16.9%). SPONDYLOLISTHESIS WAS PRESENT IN 15 PATIENTS (16.9%). ANTERIOR WEDGING WAS SEEN IN 16 (18.0%), AND COMPRESSION FRACTURES WERE PRESENT IN 13 (14.6%). THE POSES THAT WERE MOST COMMONLY IDENTIFIED AS CAUSING THE INJURIES INVOLVED HYPERFLEXION AND HYPEREXTENSION OF THE SPINE. WE CORRELATED THE KINESIOLOGIC EFFECT OF SUCH EXERCISES ON SPECIFIC MUSCULOSKELETAL STRUCTURES. CONCLUSION: YOGA POTENTIALLY HAS MANY BENEFITS, BUT CARE MUST BE TAKEN WHEN PERFORMING POSITIONS WITH EXTREME SPINAL FLEXION AND EXTENSION. PATIENTS WITH OSTEOPENIA OR OSTEOPOROSIS MAY HAVE HIGHER RISK OF COMPRESSION FRACTURES OR DEFORMITIES AND WOULD BENEFIT FROM AVOIDING EXTREME SPINAL FLEXION. PHYSICIANS SHOULD CONSIDER THIS RISK WHEN DISCUSSING YOGA AS EXERCISE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
20 1119  32 EFFICACY OF BOLUS LUKEWARM SALINE AND YOGA POSTURES AS COLONOSCOPY PREPARATION: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: COLONOSCOPY IS NOW THE GOLD STANDARD FOR COLON CANCER SCREENING AND A VITAL DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC TOOL IN 21ST CENTURY MEDICAL PRACTICE. ALTHOUGH ADVANCES HAVE BEEN SWIFT SINCE COLONOSCOPY CAME INTO WIDE USE A GENERATION AGO, ITS EFFECTIVENESS CAN BE COMPROMISED BY PATIENTS' ABILITY TO ADEQUATELY PREPARE FOR THE PROCEDURE. MANY PATIENTS DREAD THIS TASK MORE THAN THE PROCEDURE ITSELF. WHILE NO PREP REGIMEN CAN BE IDEAL FOR ALL PATIENTS, THE AUTHORS PRESENT A NOVEL APPROACH THAT REPRESENTS A POTENTIAL TIME-SAVING IMPROVEMENT FOR YOUNGER, HEALTHIER PATIENTS. IT IS A MODERN VERSION OF AN INDIAN PRACTICE CALLED SHANKH PRAKSHALANA, IN WHICH LUKEWARM SALINE IS USED IN COMBINATION WITH FIVE YOGA POSTURES TO CLEANSE THE BOWEL. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE SAFETY, EFFICACY, AND TOLERABILITY OF LUKEWARM SALINE AND YOGA (LWS/YOGA) AS A COLONOSCOPY PREPARATION IN COMPARISON WITH NULYTELY((R)) (PEG-3350, SODIUM CHLORIDE, SODIUM BICARBONATE, AND POTASSIUM CHLORIDE SOLUTION) USED ACCORDING TO THE MANUFACTURER'S INSTRUCTIONS. RESEARCH DESIGN: THIS WAS A PILOT STUDY COMPRISING 54 HEALTHY ADULTS, AGES 18-65, EQUALLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: GROUP A PREPARING WITH LUKEWARM SALINE AND YOGA POSTURES (LWS/YOGA); AND GROUP B PREPARING WITH NULYTELY((R)) AS DIRECTED ON THE LABEL. MEASUREMENTS: DATA WERE COLLECTED ON THE QUALITY OF BOWEL PREPARATION, PATIENT SAFETY, PATIENT TOLERABILITY, AND SIDE-EFFECTS. THE SETTING WAS A JOINT COMMISSION ACCREDITED OUTPATIENT ENDOSCOPY CLINIC. INTERVENTIONS: PATIENTS PERFORMED THE SERIES OF FIVE YOGA POSTURES KNOWN AS SHANKH PRAKSHALANA, INTERRUPTING THE EXERCISES AT REGULAR INTERVALS TO CONSUME 480 ML OF LUKEWARM SALINE. THE SOLUTION WAS PREPARED BY ADDING 9 G OF SODIUM CHLORIDE PER LITER OF LUKEWARM WATER (99 DEGREES F-102 DEGREES F/37.2 DEGREES C-38.9 DEGREES C). RESULTS: THE MEAN TOTAL SCORE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER IN GROUP A VERSUS GROUP B (20.63 +/- 5.09 VERSUS 16.48 +/- 5.18, P < 0.0007). IN GROUP A, 24/27 (88.9%) OF PATIENTS HAD EXCELLENT OR OPTIMUM TOTAL SCORES, COMPARED WITH 21/27 (77.8%) IN GROUP B (NOT SIGNIFICANT). IN OUR PILOT STUDY, LWS/YOGA, USED UNDER SUPERVISION, PRODUCED BETTER COLON PREPARATION THAN NULYTELY, USED AS DIRECTED. LIMITATIONS: A RANDOMIZED, ENDOSCOPIST-BLINDED STUDY IS NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE RESULTS. CONCLUSIONS: SHANKH PRAKSHALANA IS EFFECTIVE AS A COLONOSCOPY PREPARATION.	2010

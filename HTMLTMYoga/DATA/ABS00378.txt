1  378 143 BARRIERS TO YOGA THERAPY AS AN ADD-ON TREATMENT FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA IN INDIA. AIM: TO DESCRIBE THE POSSIBLE BARRIERS TO YOGA THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA IN INDIA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL AT NIMHANS, PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA (ON STABLE DOSES OF ANTIPSYCHOTICS, 18-60 YEARS OF AGE, WITH A CLINICAL GLOBAL IMPRESSION-SEVERITY SCORE OF 3 OR MORE) WERE RANDOMIZED INTO ONE OF THREE LIMBS: YOGA THERAPY, PHYSICAL EXERCISE AND WAITLIST. OF 857 PATIENTS SCREENED, 392 (45.7%) PATIENTS WERE FOUND ELIGIBLE FOR THE STUDY. AMONG THEM, 223 (56.8%) DECLINED TO TAKE PART IN THE TRIAL. THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR DECLINING WERE ANALYZED. RESULTS: THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR DECLINING WERE (A) DISTANCE FROM THE CENTER (N=83; 37.2%); (B) NO ONE TO ACCOMPANY THEM FOR TRAINING (N=25; 11.2%); (C) BUSY WORK SCHEDULE (N=21, 9.4%); (D) UNWILLING TO COME FOR ONE MONTH (N=11; 4.9%), (E) NOT WILLING FOR YOGA THERAPY (N=9, 4.0%); (F) PERSONAL REASONS (N=3, 1.3%); (G) RELIGIOUS REASONS (N=1, 0.4%). IN 70 PATIENTS (31.6%), NO REASONS WERE ASCRIBED. NO PATIENT REFUSED CITING RESEARCH NATURE OF THE INTERVENTION AS A REASON. CONCLUSION: MORE THAN HALF OF THE PATIENTS ELIGIBLE FOR YOGA DID NOT CONSENT TO THE STUDY. LOGISTIC FACTORS, SUCH AS THE NEED FOR DAILY TRAINING UNDER SUPERVISION IN A SPECIALIZED CENTER FOR LONG PERIODS, ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT BARRIERS THAT PREVENT PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA FROM RECEIVING YOGA THERAPY. ALTERNATIVE MODELS/SCHEDULES THAT ARE PATIENT-FRIENDLY MUST BE EXPLORED TO REACH THE BENEFIT OF YOGA TO PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
2 2615  38 YOGA FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA: PATIENTS' PERSPECTIVE. CONTEXT: YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION IS EMERGING AS AN EFFECTIVE ADD-ON THERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. HOWEVER, MANY BARRIERS MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR PATIENTS TO AVAIL YOGA THERAPY PROGRAMS. ONE OF THEM IS MOTIVATION FOR YOGA THERAPY. WAYS TO ADDRESS THE BARRIERS ARE CRITICAL TO EMPLOY YOGA AS A TREATMENT IN THIS POPULATION. AIM: THIS STUDY AIMS AT EXPLORING PATIENTS' WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN ADD-ON YOGA THERAPY PROGRAMS ON OUT-PATIENT BASIS. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON 100 SCHIZOPHRENIA PATIENTS ATTENDING PSYCHIATRY OUT-PATIENT SERVICES OF A TERTIARY CARE HOSPITAL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 100 SCHIZOPHRENIA PATIENTS (MALE: FEMALE = 57:43; AGE: 35.8 +/- 9.2 YEARS) ATTENDING THE PSYCHIATRY OUT-PATIENT SERVICES OF A TERTIARY NEUROPSYCHIATRY HOSPITAL WERE ADMINISTERED A SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRE. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: CHI-SQUARE TEST WAS USED FOR TESTING THE SIGNIFICANCE OF PROPORTIONS. P < 0.05 WAS TAKEN TO BE SIGNIFICANT. RESULTS: ABOUT 46% WERE AWARE THAT YOGA IS ALSO ONE OF THE COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES USEFUL IN SCHIZOPHRENIA. 32% HAD TRIED YOGA IN THE PAST FOR SOME REASONS, BUT ONLY 31% OF THEM WERE CONTINUING YOGA; COMMONEST REASONS FOR NOT CONTINUING BEING LACK OF MOTIVATION (31%) AND INABILITY TO SPARE TIME (27.6%). HOWEVER, THE MAJORITY (88.5%) OF THEM WERE WILLING TO TAKE UP ADD-ON YOGA THERAPY ON OUT-PATIENT BASIS ALONG WITH THEIR REGULAR MEDICAL FOLLOW-UP. CONCLUSIONS: IN SPITE OF THE LACK OF MOTIVATION TO PRACTICE YOGA, THE MAJORITY OF PATIENTS WERE WILLING TO PARTICIPATE IN ADD-ON YOGA THERAPY PROGRAMS IF GIVEN ON OUT-PATIENT BASIS ALONG WITH THEIR REGULAR CONVENTIONAL MEDICAL FOLLOW-UP.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
3  386  22 BENEFITS AND ADVERSE EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA PRACTICE: A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY FROM INDIA. OBJECTIVE: BENEFITS AND ADVERSE EFFECTS OF YOGA WERE REPORTED IN SURVEYS FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO (I) DETERMINE THE BENEFITS AND ADVERSE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN YOGA EXPERIENCED PERSONS IN INDIA AND (II) CORRELATE THESE EFFECTS OF YOGA WITH FACTORS RELATED TO THE INDIVIDUAL AND THEIR YOGA PRACTICE. DESIGN AND SETTING: THIS CONVENIENCE SAMPLING IN-PERSON SURVEY REPORTS BENEFITS AND ADVERSE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN 3135 YOGA EXPERIENCED PERSONS. RESULTS: THE BENEFITS OF YOGA WERE REPORTED BY 94.5 PERCENT OF THE RESPONDENTS. THE THREE MOST COMMON BENEFITS WERE IMPROVEMENT IN: (I) PHYSICAL FITNESS, (II) MENTAL STATE AND (III) COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS. AN ADVERSE EFFECT OF YOGA WAS REPORTED BY 1.9 PERCENT OF THE RESPONDENTS. THE THREE MOST COMMON ADVERSE EFFECTS REPORTED WERE: (I) SORENESS AND PAIN, (II) MUSCLE INJURIES AND (III) FATIGUE. THE FOLLOWING FACTORS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION (IN ALL CASES P < 0.05 CHI SQUARE TEST; CRAMER'S V > 0.10) WITH REPORTED BENEFITS OF YOGA: (I) EXPERIENCE OF YOGA IN MONTHS, (II) TIME SPENT PRACTICING YOGA IN A WEEK, (III) NUMBER OF YOGA TECHNIQUES PRACTICED, AND (IV) WHETHER AWARENESS WAS MAINTAINED DURING THE YOGA PRACTICE OR NOT. CONCLUSION: BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE TO PHYSICAL HEALTH WERE THE MOST COMMON, WITH SORENESS AND PAIN THE MOST COMMON ADVERSE EFFECT OF YOGA. YOGA PRACTICE RELATED FACTORS INFLUENCE THE BENEFITS OF YOGA.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
4 1732  39 PERSPECTIVE OF PATIENTS REFERRED TO YOGA CENTER IN A TERTIARY NEUROPSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL: A CROSS-SECTIONAL RETROSPECTIVE STUDY. BACKGROUND: YOGA HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE OR COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY IN PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS DEPENDING ON THE TYPE AND SEVERITY OF THE DISORDERS. HOWEVER, DATA RELATED TO PERSPECTIVE ON YOGA SERVICES AND THE BENEFITS AND ADVERSE EFFECTS ATTRIBUTED TO YOGA BY PATIENTS WITH MAJOR PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS IS LACKING. AIM: THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO ASSESS FEEDBACK OF THE PATIENTS WHO ATTENDED YOGA SESSIONS AT A YOGA CENTER IN A TERTIARY NEUROPSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS WAS A CROSS-SECTIONAL RETROSPECTIVE STUDY USING A SPECIFIC QUESTIONNAIRE TO GET FEEDBACK FROM PATIENTS REFERRED TO THE NIMHANS INTEGRATED CENTER FOR YOGA, AT THE END OF THEIR YOGA TRAINING. RESULTS: TWO HUNDRED AND ONE PATIENTS' DATA WERE INCLUDED IN THIS RETROSPECTIVE STUDY. MOST OF THE PATIENTS WERE REFERRED BY THE DOCTORS. THE YOGA MODULE FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA WAS MOST COMMONLY UTILIZED, FOLLOWED BY DEPRESSION. ON AN AVERAGE, PATIENTS ATTENDED 13 SESSIONS. MOST OF THEM PRACTICED YOGA FOR 1-2 WEEKS AND HAD MISSED LESS THAN 2 SESSIONS. THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE PATIENTS REPORTED THAT PRACTICING YOGA HELPED THEM. SPEARMAN CORRELATION ANALYSIS REVEALED POSITIVE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN IMPROVEMENT ATTRIBUTED TO YOGA AND VARIABLES AFFECTING QUALITY OF YOGA SERVICES AT THE CENTER, INCLUDING THE QUALITY OF YOGA SESSIONS ATTENDED. OVERALL HEALTH AND SLEEP IMPROVEMENT ALSO POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH IMPROVEMENT ATTRIBUTED TO YOGA. A MINORITY OF PATIENTS REPORTED ADVERSE EFFECTS, ALTHOUGH THESE DID NOT LEAD TO DISCONTINUATION. CONCLUSION: IN THIS RETROSPECTIVE STUDY OF PATIENTS REFERRED TO A YOGA CENTER IN A TERTIARY PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY, THE MAJORITY OF PATIENTS WITH MAJOR MENTAL DISORDERS WERE ABLE TO PRACTICE YOGA UNDER SUPERVISION AND REPORTED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SYMPTOMS WITH MINIMAL ADVERSE EFFECTS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                            
5 2103  29 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY LEVEL IN SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS. PURPOSE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY LEVEL IN SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN WITH PRETEST-POSTTEST CONTROL GROUP. THE POPULATION OF THE STUDY CONSISTED OF SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS WITH REGISTERED IN MALATYA AND ELAZIG COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH CENTERS AND REGULARLY GOING TO THESE CENTERS. THE SAMPLE GROUP OF THE STUDY CONSISTED OF TOTALLY 100 PATIENTS INCLUDING 50 PATIENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND 50 PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP WHO WERE SPECIFIED THROUGH POWER ANALYSIS AND CHOSEN BY USING RANDOM SAMPLING METHOD FROM THIS POPULATION. THE DATA WERE COLLECTED BETWEEN APRIL 2015 AND AUGUST 2015. 'PATIENT DESCRIPTION FORM' AND 'FROGS' WERE USED TO COLLECT THE DATA. YOGA WAS APPLIED TO PATIENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP. ANY INTERVENTION WAS NOT MADE TO PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP. PERCENTAGE DISTRIBUTION, ARITHMETIC MEAN, STANDARD DEVIATION, CHI-SQUARE, INDEPENDENT SAMPLES T TEST, AND PAIRED T TEST WERE USED TO ASSESS THE DATA. RESULTS: PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL AND EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PRETEST SUBSCALE AND THE TOTAL MEANS SCORES OF FROGS WAS FOUND TO BE LOW. IN THE POSTTEST SUBSCALE AND TOTAL MEANS SCORES OF FROGS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WERE HIGHER THAN IN THE CONTROL GROUP AND THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM WERE FOUND TO BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P<0.05). IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PRETEST AND POSTTEST SUBSCALE AND TOTAL MEANS SCORES OF FR0GS WAS DETERMINED TO BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: YOGA THAT APPLIED TO SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS IT WAS DETERMINED TO INCREASED THE LEVEL OF FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY. IT CAN BE SUGGESTED THAT YOGA SHOULD BE USED AS AN COMPLEMENTARY METHOD IN NURSING PRACTISE IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE TREATMENT.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
6 1138  28 EFFICACY OF YOGA THERAPY ON SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING AND BASIC LIVING SKILLS OF PATIENTS HAVING CHRONIC SCHIZOPHRENIA. BACKGROUND: SCIENTIFIC STUDIES DEMONSTRATE EFFICACY OF YOGIC TREATMENT METHODS IN STRESS AND ANXIETY RELATED DISORDERS, PSYCHOSOMATIC DISORDERS AND PHYSICAL ILLNESS. VERY FEW STUDIES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED ON SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS. AIMS: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA THERAPY ON SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING, BASIC LIVING SKILLS, SELF-CARE, INTERPERSONAL, COMMUNICATIONAL AND ROUTINE FUNCTIONS OF SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIRTY CHRONIC SCHIZOPHRENIC HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS WERE SELECTED FROM RANCHI INSTITUTE OF NEURO-PSYCHIATRY AND ALLIED SCIENCES, RANCHI AND WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (YOGA THERAPY ALONG WITH PHARMACOTHERAPY, N=15), AND TO CONTROL GROUP (PHARMACOTHERAPY ALONE, N=15). BASELINE ASSESSMENT WAS DONE USING POST GRADUATE INSTITUTE GENERAL WELL-BEING MEASURE (GWBM), CHECKLIST FOR BASIC LIVING SKILLS AND INDIAN DISABILITY EVALUATION AND ASSESSMENT SCALE (IDEAS). THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP ATTENDED YOGA THERAPY EVERY DAY FOR ABOUT 1(1/2) H INCLUDING MOTIVATIONAL AND FEEDBACK SESSION. AFTER 1 MONTH POST-ASSESSMENT WAS DONE FOR BOTH THE GROUPS. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: PEARSON CHI-SQUARE TEST WAS USED FOR COMPARING THE RESULTS. RESULTS: AT THE END OF 1 MONTH EXPERIMENTAL GROUP SHOWED BETTER RATING IN COMPARISON TO CONTROL GROUP IN PGI GWBM, BASIC LIVING SKILLS AND IDEAS. CONCLUSION: YOGA COULD IMPROVE PATIENTS' SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING, THEIR DAILY BASIC LIVING FUNCTIONING, PERSONAL HYGIENE, SELF-CARE, INTERPERSONAL ACTIVITIES AND COMMUNICATION, AND PROMPTED MORE INVOLVEMENT IN ROUTINE WORK.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
7 1221  29 FACTORS INFLUENCING TREATMENT ACCEPTANCE IN NEUROTIC PATIENTS REFERRED FOR YOGA THERAPY-;AN EXPLORATORY STUDY. A TOTAL OF 186 NEUROTIC PATIENTS SEEKING TREATMENT IN THE PSYCHIATRY OUTPATIENT CLINIC OF THE NEHRU HOSPITAL, P.G.I.M.E.R. WERE ASSIGNED CONSEQUENTLY TO THREE TREATMENTS I.E. YOGA THERAPY (Y), YOGIC RELAXATION (YR) AND CHEMOTHERAPY (C). A RECORD WAS KEPT OF THE NUMBER OF VISITS MADE BY EACH PATIENT DURING THE 5 MONTHS STUDY PERIOD. IN ORDER TO FIND OUT THE FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH TREATMENT ACCEPTANCE, A COMPARISON WAS MADE OF THOSE SUBJECTS WHO COMPLETED 4-6 WEEKS OF TREATMENT WITH THOSE WHO DROPPED OUT BEFORE COMPLETING THE TREATMENT IN THE YOGA GROUP. THE DROPOUTS AND NON-DROPOUTS WERE FOUND TO BE COMPARABLE ON SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL VARIABLES. THEY WERE ALSO SIMILAR WITH REGARD TO THE ATTITUDE TO YOGA. THE ONLY FACTOR WHICH DISTINGUISHED THE TWO GROUPS WAS THE SEVERITY OF ILLNESS AT INTAKE. THOSE WHO CONTINUED TREATMENT HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SCORES ON THE P. G. I. HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE N-2 AND THE CLINICAL RATINGS OF THE SEVERITY OF ILLNESS. FURTHER, ANALYSIS OF STAGE AT WHICH DROPOUT OCCURRED, AND THE RESPONSES TO THE REPLY PAID QUESTIONNAIRE INDICATED THAT TREATMENT FAILURE AS NOT THE MAIN REASON FOR DROPOUT.	1989	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
8 1774  33 PRACTICE AND ACCEPTABILITY OF YOGA AMONG PREGNANT WOMEN IN INDIA: A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY. THE PRACTICE OF YOGA IS BENEFICIAL DURING PREGNANCY, BUT WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT PROPORTION OF PREGNANT WOMEN IN INDIA PRACTICE YOGA. TO ADDRESS THIS RESEARCH GAP, WE CONDUCTED A STUDY TO ADDRESS FOLLOWING RESEARCH QUESTIONS: (1) WHAT PROPORTION OF PREGNANT WOMEN IN RURAL MAHARASHTRA PRACTICE YOGA? (2) WHICH SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRACTICE OF YOGA AMONG THESE WOMEN? AND (3) WHAT IS THE PERCEIVED ACCEPTABILITY OF INTEGRATING YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION INTO ROUTINE ANTENATAL CARE? A CONSECUTIVE SAMPLE OF PREGNANT WOMEN ATTENDING THE ANTENATAL CLINIC OF A TERTIARY CARE HOSPITAL, WHO COULD FLUENTLY COMMUNICATE IN MARATHI AND WHO DID NOT HAVE ANY SERIOUS PHYSICAL ILLNESS OR COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, WERE INCLUDED IN THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY. A TOTAL OF 228 SUBJECTS WERE INCLUDED IN OUR STUDY. YOGA WAS PRACTICED BY 38 OF THEM (16.7%, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL 12.1-22.1) DURING THE CURRENT PREGNANCY. OLDER AGE, HIGHER EDUCATION, AND BEING A PROFESSIONAL (TEACHER, HEALTHCARE PROVIDER, OR BANK OFFICIAL) WERE ASSOCIATED WITH PRACTICE OF YOGA. MORE THAN HALF OF THE PARTICIPANTS (53.9%) THOUGHT THAT YOGA SHOULD BE INCLUDED AS PART OF THEIR ANTENATAL CARE; THIS PERCEIVED ACCEPTABILITY OF YOGA WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH ANY OF THE SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS EXCEPT FOR THE PARTICIPANTS' OCCUPATION. THIS STUDY PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE PREVALENCE AND SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRACTICE OF YOGA AMONG PREGNANT WOMEN IN A RURAL SETTING IN INDIA. IT ALSO EXPLORES THE PERCEIVED ACCEPTABILITY OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS AMONG THIS GROUP. FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY CAN INFORM DESIGN OF FUTURE STUDIES TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS DURING PREGNANCY.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
9 2871  24 YOGA-BASED RELAXATION TECHNIQUE FACILITATES SUSTAINED ATTENTION IN PATIENTS WITH LOW BACK PAIN: A PILOT STUDY. CONTEXT: THE EXPERIENCE OF PAIN STRONGLY INFLUENCES SUSTAINED ATTENTION, WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR NEUROCOGNITIVE PERFORMANCE. YOGA-BASED RELAXATION TECHNIQUES MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING SUSTAINED ATTENTION BY ATTENUATING PAIN IN PATIENTS WITH LOW BACK PAIN. HENCE, WE AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF A YOGA-BASED RELAXATION TECHNIQUE ON SUSTAINED ATTENTION AND SELF-REPORTED PAIN DISABILITY IN PATIENTS WITH LOW BACK PAIN. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 22 MEN AGED 30 TO 50 YEARS WITH LOW BACK PAIN WERE RECRUITED FOR THE STUDY. THEY WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER THE YOGA (N = 11) OR CONTROL (N = 11) GROUPS. THE YOGA GROUP PRACTICED A YOGA-BASED RELAXATION TECHNIQUE (YBRT) 1 HOUR A DAY FOR 4 WEEKS AND THE CONTROL GROUP MAINTAINED THEIR USUAL PHYSICAL ACTIVITY REGIMEN. ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED THE SUSTAINED ATTENTION TO RESPONSE TASK (SART) AND THE OSWESTRY LOW BACK PAIN DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE (OLBPDQ) MEASURED BEFORE AND AFTER THE 4-WEEK INTERVENTION. RESULTS: THE STUDY SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN ALL SELF-REPORTED OLBPDQ DOMAINS AND IMPROVEMENT IN SUSTAINED ATTENTION IN A BEFORE AND AFTER COMPARISON 4 WEEKS FOLLOWING THE YOGA INTERVENTION. PEARSON'S CORRELATION ALSO SHOWED A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN SUSTAINED ATTENTION AND PAIN REDUCTION FOLLOWING THE YOGA INTERVENTION. CONCLUSION: THE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT YOGA PRACTICE REDUCES PAIN AND SIMULTANEOUSLY IMPROVES INFORMATION PROCESSING SPEED WITH IMPULSE CONTROL DURING THE PERFORMANCE OF A SUSTAINED ATTENTION TASK.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
10 2740  31 YOGA PRACTICE AMONG VETERANS WITH AND WITHOUT CHRONIC PAIN: A MIXED METHODS STUDY. OBJECTIVES: THE PRIMARY AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE DIFFERENCES IN YOGA PRACTICE BETWEEN PERSONS WITH AND WITHOUT CHRONIC PAIN. SECONDARILY, WE DESCRIBE USE OF THE ESSENTIAL PROPERTIES OF YOGA QUESTIONNAIRE, SHORT FORM (EPYQ-SF) FOR SELF-REPORT. DESIGN: PARTICIPANTS WERE MEMBERS OF AN EXISTING COHORT OF VETERANS WHO COMPLETED A 2015-2016 SURVEY FOCUSED ON PAIN AND NONPHARMACOLOGICAL HEALTH PRACTICES. COHORT MEMBERS WHO REPORTED YOGA IN THE PAST YEAR [N=174 (9.4%) OF 1850] WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THE PRESENT STUDY, WHICH USED MULTIPLE-CONTACT MIXED-MODE SURVEY METHODOLOGY TO COLLECT DATA ON YOGA PRACTICES. THE EPYQ-SF WAS USED TO ASSESS PROPERTIES AND CONTEXT OF YOGA PRACTICE. PRACTICE PATTERNS WERE COMPARED FOR PARTICIPANTS WITH AND WITHOUT CHRONIC PAIN. TO EXPLORE POTENTIAL REASONS FOR REPORTED YOGA PRACTICE PATTERNS, FOCUSED SEMISTRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH A SUBSET OF PARTICIPANTS. RESULTS: OF 174 PARTICIPANTS CONTACTED, 141 (82%) RETURNED THE YOGA QUESTIONNAIRE AND 110 (78% OF RESPONDENTS) WERE STILL PRACTICING YOGA. AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS, 41 (37%) HAD CHRONIC PAIN. PRACTITIONERS WITH CHRONIC PAIN REPORTED GENTLER (2.8 VS. 3.1, 5-POINT SCALE) AND LESS ACTIVE (2.9 VS. 3.3) YOGA PRACTICE THAN THOSE WITHOUT. THOSE WITH CHRONIC PAIN ATTENDED YOGA STUDIOS LESS FREQUENTLY AND REPORTED SHORTER YOGA PRACTICES THAN THOSE WITHOUT. MOST YOGA PRACTICE WAS SELF-DIRECTED AND AT HOME. CONCLUSIONS: DIFFERENCES IN YOGA PRACTICE OF PERSONS WITH AND WITHOUT CHRONIC PAIN HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR CHRONIC PAIN. FUTURE INTERVENTIONS SHOULD FOCUS ON ALTERNATIVE INDIVIDUAL DELIVERY FORMATS OR ADDRESSING BARRIERS TO GROUP PRACTICE AMONG PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
11 1833  21 PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLNESS, YOGA AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS AFFECTED BY SCHIZOPHRENIA SPECTRUM DISORDERS: A PILOT STUDY. SCHIZOPHRENIA IS A SERIOUS PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER CHARACTERIZED BY POSITIVE SYMPTOMS, NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS AND NEUROCOGNITIVE DEFICITS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ESTIMATE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN WELLNESS, YOGA AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS AFFECTED BY SCHIZOPHRENIA SPECTRUM DISORDERS. PARTICIPANTS WERE 30 PATIENTS WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA IN CARE AT THE REHABILITATIVE PSYCHIATRY AND RESEARCH VILLA CHIARA CLINIC IN MASCALUCIA (CATANIA, ITALY), AFTER THAT RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO TWO GROUPS. THE FIRST GROUP FOLLOWED THE EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT WITH SETS OF YOGA EXERCISES CONDUCTED BY A YOGA TRAINER AND A PSYCHIATRIST OR A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST EXPERT IN YOGA, WHILE A SECOND CONTROL GROUP WAS TREATED WITH USUAL CARE. THE RESULTS REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE, BEFORE AND AFTER TREATMENT, BETWEEN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND THE CONTROL GROUP IN QUALITY OF LIFE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
12  585  34 DESIGNING, VALIDATION, AND FEASIBILITY OF INTEGRATED YOGA THERAPY MODULE FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. CONTEXT: CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) IS A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM THAT HAS REACHED EPIDEMIC PROPORTIONS. YOGA THERAPY HAS EMERGED AS ONE OF THE COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES FOR CLBP. AIM: THE PRESENT STUDY REPORTS THE DEVELOPMENT, VALIDATION, AND FEASIBILITY OF AN INTEGRATED YOGA THERAPY MODULE (IYTM) FOR CLBP. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: THIS STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT AT THE SVYASA YOGA UNIVERSITY, BENGALURU, SOUTH INDIA. THE IYTM FOR CLBP WAS DESIGNED, VALIDATED, AND LATER TESTED FOR FEASIBILITY IN PATIENTS WITH CLBP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IN THE FIRST PHASE, IYTM FOR CLBP WAS DESIGNED BASED ON THE LITERATURE REVIEW OF CLASSICAL TEXTS AND RECENTLY PUBLISHED RESEARCH STUDIES. IN THE SECOND PHASE, DESIGNED IYTM (26 YOGA PRACTICES) WAS VALIDATED BY THIRTY SUBJECT MATTER (YOGA) EXPERTS. CONTENT VALIDITY RATIO (CVR) WAS ANALYZED USING LAWSHE'S FORMULA. IN THE THIRD PHASE, THE VALIDATED IYTM (20 YOGA PRACTICES) WAS TESTED ON 12 PATIENTS FOR PAIN, DISABILITY AND PERCEIVED STRESS AT BASELINE AND AFTER 1-MONTH OF THIS INTERVENTION. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 20 YOGA PRACTICES WITH CVR >/=0.33 WERE INCLUDED, 6 YOGA PRACTICES WITH CVR >/=0.33 WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE DESIGNED IYTM. THE FEASIBILITY STUDY WITH VALIDATED IYTM SHOWED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN NUMERICAL PAIN RATING SCALE (P = 0.02), OSWESTRY DISABILITY SCALE (P = 0.02), AND PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: THE DESIGNED IYTM WAS VALIDATED BY THIRTY YOGA EXPERTS AND LATER EVALUATED ON A SMALL SAMPLE. THIS STUDY HAS SHOWN THAT THE VALIDATED IYTM IS FEASIBLE, HAD NO ADVERSE EFFECTS AND WAS USEFUL IN ALLEVIATING PAIN, DISABILITY, AND PERCEIVED STRESS IN PATIENTS WITH CLBP. HOWEVER, RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS WITH LARGER SAMPLE ARE NEEDED TO STRENGTHEN THE STUDY.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
13 2586  37 YOGA FOR HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS: A STUDY ON BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS OF ITS IMPLEMENTATION IN PRIMARY CARE. BACKGROUND: INTERNATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR HYPERTENSION TREATMENT RECOMMEND THE USE OF YOGA, PARTICULARLY AMONG LOW-RISK PATIENTS. HOWEVER, EVIDENCE IS LACKING ON THE IMPLEMENTATION POTENTIAL OF HEALTH-WORKER-LED YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN LOW-RESOURCE, PRIMARY CARE SETTINGS. OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS BARRIERS TO AND FACILITATORS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS IN PRIMARY CARE IN NEPAL. METHODS: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED USING FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS, IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS, KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS, AND TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS. DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM THE 'YOGA AND HYPERTENSION' (YOH) TRIAL PARTICIPANTS, YOH INTERVENTION IMPLEMENTERS, AND OFFICIALS FROM THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND POPULATION IN NEPAL. RESULTS: MOST YOH TRIAL PARTICIPANTS STATED THAT: (1) IT WAS EASY TO LEARN YOGA DURING A FIVE-DAY TRAINING PERIOD AND PRACTISE IT FOR THREE MONTHS AT HOME; (2) PRACTISING YOGA IMPROVED THEIR HEALTH; AND (3) GROUP YOGA SESSIONS IN A COMMUNITY CENTRE WOULD HELP THEM PRACTISE YOGA MORE REGULARLY. MOST YOH INTERVENTION IMPLEMENTERS STATED THAT: (1) THEY WERE HIGHLY MOTIVATED TO IMPLEMENT THE INTERVENTION; (2) THE COST OF IMPLEMENTATION WAS ACCEPTABLE; (3) THEY DID NOT NEED ADDITIONAL STAFF TO EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT THE INTERVENTION; (4) PROVIDING REMUNERATION TO THE STAFF INVOLVED IN THE INTERVENTION WOULD INCREASE THEIR MOTIVATION; AND (5) THE YOGA PROGRAMME WAS 'SIMPLE AND EASY TO FOLLOW' AND 'EASILY PERFORMED BY PARTICIPANTS OF ANY AGE'. THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS STATED THAT: (1) YOGA IS CONSIDERED AS A KEY HEALTH PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY IN NEPAL; AND (2) THE INTEGRATION OF THE YOGA INTERVENTION INTO THE EXISTING HEALTH CARE PROGRAMME WOULD NOT BE TOO CHALLENGING, BECAUSE THE EXISTING PERSONNEL AND OTHER RESOURCES CAN BE UTILISED. CONCLUSION: WHILE THERE IS A GOOD POTENTIAL THAT A YOGA INTERVENTION CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN PRIMARY CARE, CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT FOR HEALTH WORKERS AND THE INVOLVEMENT OF COMMUNITY YOGA CENTRES IN THE DELIVERY OF THE INTERVENTIONS MAY BE REQUIRED TO FACILITATE THIS IMPLEMENTATION.	2021	

14 2112  25 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON STRESS, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION IN WOMEN. BACKGROUND: IN RECENT DECADES, SEVERAL MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC STUDIES ON YOGA PROVED IT TO BE VERY USEFUL IN THE TREATMENT OF SOME DISEASES. THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION IN WOMEN LIVING IN ILAM, IRAN. METHODS: THIS STUDY IS A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WITH PRE-POST TEST. TO COLLECT DATA, THE QUESTIONNAIRE OF DASS-21 (DEPRESSION ANXIETY STRESS SCALE-21) WAS USED. FOR ELIGIBLE SAMPLES, HATHA YOGA EXERCISES AND TRAINING SESSIONS WERE HELD FOR 4 WEEKS (3 TIME/WEEKS; 60-70 MIN EACH) BY A SPECIALIST. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING SPSS VERSION 20. RESULTS: 52 WOMEN WITH A MEAN AGE OF 33.5 +/- 6.5 WERE INCLUDED FOR ANALYSIS. DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND STRESS DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN WOMEN AFTER 12 SESSIONS OF REGULAR HATHA YOGA PRACTICE (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: YOGA HAS AN EFFECTIVE ROLE IN REDUCING STRESS, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION. THUS, IT CAN BE USED AS COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
15 2579  28 YOGA FOR HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN ADULT CANCER: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED FEASIBILITY STUDY. AN INCREASE IN PATIENT-LED UPTAKE OF COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN ADULT CANCER HAS LED TO A NEED FOR MORE RIGOROUS STUDY OF SUCH INTERVENTIONS AND THEIR OUTCOMES. THIS STUDY THEREFORE AIMED TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF A YOGA INTERVENTION IN MEN AND WOMEN RECEIVING CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT FOR A CANCER DIAGNOSIS. PROSPECTIVE, MIXED METHODS FEASIBILITY TRIAL ALLOCATED PARTICIPANTS TO RECEIVE ONE OF THREE YOGA INTERVENTIONS OVER A FOUR-WEEK STUDY PERIOD. DATA COLLECTION WAS COMPLETED THROUGH ONLINE SURVEY OF QOL-CA/CS AND CUSTOMIZED SURVEYS. FIFTEEN PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED (11 FEMALE) UNDERGOING TREATMENT FOR BREAST, PROSTATE, COLORECTAL, BRAIN, AND BLOOD AND LUNG CANCER. TWO PARTICIPANTS DROPPED OUT AND COMPLETE QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DATA SETS WERE COLLECTED FROM 12 PARTICIPANTS AND FOUR YOGA INSTRUCTORS. OTHER OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED IMPLEMENTATION COSTS PATIENT-REPORTED PREFERENCES FOR YOGA INTERVENTION AND CHANGES IN QOL-CA/CS. THREE TYPES OF YOGA INTERVENTION WERE SAFELY ADMINISTERED IN ADULT CANCER. MIXED METHODS, COST-EFFICIENCY, QOL-CA/CS, AND EVIDENCE-BASED DESIGN OF YOGA INTERVENTION HAVE BEEN USED TO ESTABLISH FEASIBILITY AND PATIENT-PREFERENCES FOR YOGA DELIVERY IN ADULT CANER. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT, WITH SOME METHODOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS, A LARGE-SCALE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IS WARRANTED TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR MALE AND FEMALE CANCER PATIENTS. THIS TRIAL IS REGISTERED WITH CLINICALTRIALS.GOV NCT02309112.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
16  472  29 CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA PROVIDERS AND THEIR SESSIONS AND ATTENDEES IN THE UK: A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY. YOGA IS AN ANCIENT INDIAN PHILOSOPHY AND WAY OF LIFE THAT IS BEING USED AS A METHOD OF IMPROVING HEALTH AND WELLBEING. EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT YOGA HAS SEVERAL HEALTH BENEFITS, SUCH AS MANAGING MANY NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES, SUCH AS HYPERTENSION, AND IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH. THE POPULARITY OF YOGA IS GROWING IN THE UK, BUT IT IS MOSTLY UNREGULATED WITH LITTLE INFORMATION AVAILABLE ABOUT YOGA PROVIDERS AND THEIR SESSIONS AND ATTENDEES. THIS STUDY AIMED TO EXPLORE WHO IS PROVIDING YOGA; WHAT SESSIONS ARE AVAILABLE, WHERE, AND AT WHAT COST; AND WHO ATTENDS THESE SESSIONS IN THE UK AND WHETHER YOGA PROVIDERS WERE AWARE OF HEALTH CONDITIONS IN THEIR SESSIONS. A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY WAS UNDERTAKEN AMONG YOGA PROVIDERS IN THE UK. THEY WERE APPROACHED THROUGH FOUR MAJOR UK YOGA ASSOCIATIONS. IN TOTAL, 407 YOGA PROVIDERS PARTICIPATED. MOST PROVIDERS WERE AGED 45-64 YEARS (69%), FEMALE (93%), AND WHITE (93%). THE MEDIAN NUMBER OF GROUP SESSIONS AND ONE-TO-ONE SESSIONS DELIVERED PER WEEK WAS FOUR AND TWO, RESPECTIVELY. THE MOST COMMON STYLES WERE HATHA (28%), IYENGAR (26%), AND VINYASA (15%). SESSIONS HAD A VARYING EMPHASIS ON DIFFERENT YOGIC PRACTICES, BUT 59% OF PROVIDERS ALLOCATED MOST TIME TO YOGIC POSES (ASANA), 18% TO BREATHING PRACTICES (PRANAYAMA), AND 12% TO MEDITATION (DHYANA) AND RELAXATION PRACTICES. MOST (73%) REPORTED THAT THEIR ATTENDEES DISCLOSED THEIR HEALTH CONDITIONS TO THEM, MOST COMMONLY MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES (41%), HYPERTENSION (25%), AND HEART DISEASES (9%). THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT YOGA SESSIONS ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE IN THE UK, OFTEN PROVIDED AND PRACTICED BY WOMEN, AND CONCENTRATE ON YOGIC POSES. SESSIONS CONCENTRATE ON THE ASANA AND TEND NOT TO INCLUDE MANY OF THE MORE HOLISTIC ASPECTS OF YOGA THAT ARE PRACTICED IN SOUTH ASIAN COUNTRIES. YOGA PROVIDERS ARE OFTEN AWARE OF HEALTH CONDITIONS BUT MAY BENEFIT FROM TRAINING TO DELIVER SESSIONS SUITABLE FOR SPECIFIC HEALTH CONDITIONS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                       
17  595  26 DEVELOPMENT AND FEASIBILITY OF NEED-BASED YOGA PROGRAM FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS OF IN-PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA IN INDIA. CONTEXT AND AIM: YOGA HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF STRESS. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A YOGA PROGRAM AIMED TO REDUCE BURDEN AND IMPROVE COPING OF FAMILY CAREGIVERS OF INPATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA IN INDIA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BASED ON THE ASSESSMENT OF CAREGIVER NEEDS, LITERATURE REVIEW, AND EXPERT OPINION, A TEN-DAY GROUP YOGA PROGRAM WAS INITIALLY DEVELOPED USING THE QUALITATIVE INDUCTIVE METHOD OF INQUIRY. EACH DAY'S PROGRAM INCLUDED WARM-UP EXERCISES, YOGIC ASANAS, PRANAYAMA, AND SATSANG. A STRUCTURED QUESTIONNAIRE ELICITING COMMENTS ON EACH DAY'S CONTENTS WAS GIVEN INDEPENDENTLY TO TEN EXPERIENCED YOGA PROFESSIONALS WORKING IN THE FIELD OF HEALTH FOR VALIDATION. THE FINAL VERSION OF THE PROGRAM WAS PILOT-TESTED ON A GROUP OF SIX CAREGIVERS OF IN-PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA ADMITTED AT NIMHANS, BANGALORE. RESULTS: ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE PROGRAM WOULD HELP REDUCE THE BURDEN OF CAREGIVERS, SIX OF THE TEN EXPERTS (60%) GAVE A RANK OF FOUR OF FIVE (VERY MUCH USEFUL). BASED ON COMMENTS OF THE EXPERTS, SEVERAL CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE PROGRAM. IN THE PILOT-TESTING STAGE, MORE THAN 60% OF THE CAREGIVERS ASSIGNED A SCORE OF FOUR AND ABOVE (ON A FIVE-POINT LIKERT SCALE, FIVE BEING EXTREMELY USEFUL) FOR THE OVERALL PROGRAM, HANDOUTS DISTRIBUTED, AND PERFORMANCE OF THE TRAINER. QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK OF THE CAREGIVERS FURTHER ENDORSED THE FEASIBILITY AND USEFULNESS OF THE PROGRAM. CONCLUSION: THE DEVELOPED YOGA PROGRAM WAS FOUND TO BE ACCEPTABLE TO CAREGIVERS OF IN-PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
18 1414  30 IMPLEMENTING YOGA THERAPY ADAPTED FOR OLDER VETERANS WHO ARE CANCER SURVIVORS. OBJECTIVES: THIS GOAL OF THIS PAPER IS TO DESCRIBE THE REACH, APPLICATION, AND EFFECTIVENESS OF AN 8-WEEK YOGA THERAPY PROTOCOL WITH OLDER CANCER SURVIVORS WITHIN A VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION SETTING. METHODS: TO DOCUMENT THE REACH OF THIS INTERVENTION, RECRUITMENT EFFORTS, ATTENDANCE, AND PRACTICE RATES WERE TRACKED. TO EXPLORE THE APPLICATION OF THE PROTOCOL TO THIS POPULATION, PHYSICAL THERAPY PRE-ASSESSMENT AND OBSERVATIONS BY THE YOGA THERAPIST WERE RECORDED TO ASCERTAIN NECESSARY POSE MODIFICATIONS. EFFECTIVENESS WAS MEASURED THROUGH PRE- AND POST-COURSE STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS, TRACKING SELF-REPORTED SYMPTOMS OF COMBAT-RELATED POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, FATIGUE, INSOMNIA, AND PAIN. RESULTS: REGARDING REACH, 15% OF ELIGIBLE VETERANS (N = 14) ENROLLED, PARTICIPATED IN 3-16 CLASSES (M+/-SD = 11.64+/-3.39), AND PRACTICED AT HOME FOR 0-56 DAYS (M+/-SD = 26.36+/-17.87). PARTICIPANTS WERE PRIMARILY CAUCASIAN (N = 13), MALE (N = 13), RANGED IN AGE FROM 55 TO 78 YEARS (M+/-SD = 65.64+/-5.15), AND HAD MULTIPLE MEDICAL PROBLEMS. DURING APPLICATION, SUBSTANTIAL INDIVIDUALIZED MODIFICATIONS TO THE YOGA THERAPY PROTOCOL WERE NECESSARY. EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERVENTION WAS MIXED. DURING POST-COURSE INTERVIEWS, PARTICIPANTS REPORTED A VARIETY OF QUALITATIVE BENEFITS. NOTABLY, THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS REPORTED THAT BREATHING AND RELAXATION TECHNIQUES WERE THE MOST USEFUL TO LEARN. GROUP COMPARISONS OF MEAN PRE- AND POST-COURSE SCORES ON STANDARDIZED MEASURES SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES. CONCLUSIONS: A MINORITY OF OLDER VETERANS EXPRESS AN INTEREST IN YOGA, BUT THOSE WHO DO HAVE HIGH RATES OF CLASS ATTENDANCE AND HOME PRACTICE. CAREFUL PHYSICAL PRE-ASSESSMENT AND ATTENTIVE THERAPISTS ARE REQUIRED TO UNDERTAKE THE ADAPTATIONS REQUIRED BY PARTICIPANTS WITH MULTIPLE COMORBIDITIES. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN THIS SETTING REQUIRES ADDITIONAL STUDY.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                               
19 1512  26 IS THERE MORE TO YOGA THAN EXERCISE? CONTEXT: YOGA IS INCREASING IN POPULARITY, WITH AN ESTIMATED 15 MILLION PRACTITIONERS IN THE UNITED STATES, YET THERE IS A DEARTH OF EMPIRICAL DATA ADDRESSING THE HOLISTIC BENEFITS OF YOGA. OBJECTIVE: TO COMPARE THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL BENEFITS OF AN EXERCISE-BASED YOGA PRACTICE TO THAT OF A MORE COMPREHENSIVE YOGA PRACTICE (ONE WITH AN ETHICAL/SPIRITUAL COMPONENT). DESIGN: STUDENTS WITH MILD TO MODERATE DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, OR STRESS AND WHO AGREED TO PARTICIPATE WERE ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THREE GROUPS: INTEGRATED YOGA, YOGA AS EXERCISE, CONTROL. PARTICIPANTS: A TOTAL OF 81 UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS 18 YEARS AND OLDER AT A UNIVERSITY IN THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, STRESS, HOPE, AND SALIVARY CORTISOL. RESULTS: OVER TIME, PARTICIPANTS IN BOTH THE INTEGRATED AND EXERCISE YOGA GROUPS EXPERIENCED DECREASED DEPRESSION AND STRESS, AN INCREASED SENSE OF HOPEFULNESS, AND INCREASED FLEXIBILITY COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. HOWEVER, ONLY THE INTEGRATED YOGA GROUP EXPERIENCED DECREASED ANXIETY-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND DECREASED SALIVARY CORTISOL FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END OF THE STUDY. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA, PRACTICED IN A MORE INTEGRATED FORM, IE, WITH AN ETHICAL AND SPIRITUAL COMPONENT, MAY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS OVER YOGA PRACTICED AS AN EXERCISE REGIMEN.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
20 1786  32 PREDICTORS OF YOGA USE AMONG PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. OBJECTIVE: EMERGING RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT YOGA MAY BE BENEFICIAL FOR REDUCING SYMPTOMS AND IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. HOWEVER, VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WHO USE YOGA; THUS, THIS STUDY SEEKS TO IDENTIFY THE SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA USERS AMONG THIS POPULATION. DESIGN: A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY STUDY WAS CONDUCTED. SETTING: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT AN OUTPATIENT BREAST ONCOLOGY CLINIC AT A LARGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL. PARTICIPANTS: THREE HUNDRED POSTMENOPAUSAL BREAST CANCER PATIENTS CURRENTLY RECEIVING AROMATASE INHIBITORS WERE INCLUDED IN THIS STUDY. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: SELF-REPORTED USE OF YOGA FOLLOWING THE CANCER DIAGNOSIS WAS COLLECTED ALONG WITH SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL DATA. MULTIVARIATE LOGISTIC REGRESSION WAS USED TO IDENTIFY INDEPENDENT PREDICTORS OF YOGA USE AMONG BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. RESULTS: OF 300 PARTICIPANTS, 53 (17.7%) REPORTED HAVING USED YOGA FOLLOWING CANCER DIAGNOSIS. WHITE PATIENTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO USE YOGA THAN NONWHITE PATIENTS (P = .02). HIGHER EDUCATION LEVEL, LOWER BMI (BODY MASS INDEX), PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT STATUS, PREVIOUS CHEMOTHERAPY, AND RADIATION THERAPY WERE ALL ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER YOGA USE (ALL P < .05). CONTROLLING FOR OTHER FACTORS, GREATER YOGA USE WAS INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER EDUCATION LEVEL (ADJUSTED ODDS RATIO [AOR] 2.72, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI], 1.15-6.46), AND LOWER BMI (AOR 0.25, 95% CI, 0.09-0.66). CONCLUSION: YOGA USE FOLLOWING BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSIS WAS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER FOR WHITE PATIENTS AND THOSE WITH LOWER BMI AND HIGHER EDUCATION LEVELS. CONSIDERING ITS POTENTIAL BENEFITS FOR SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT IN CANCER, MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND THE ATTITUDES AND BARRIERS TO YOGA USE AMONG INDIVIDUALS WITH NONWHITE RACE, LOWER EDUCATION, AND HIGHER BMI LEVEL. SUCH INVESTIGATION WILL HELP DESIGN YOGA PROGRAMS THAT ARE ALIGNED TO THE NEEDS OF THESE POPULATIONS.	2010

1 1498 149 INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE CHANGES AND OCULAR BIOMETRY DURING SIRSASANA (HEADSTAND POSTURE) IN YOGA PRACTITIONERS. PURPOSE: TO STUDY THE INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE (IOP) CHANGES IN SIRSASANA (HEADSTAND POSTURE) DONE BY EXPERIENCED YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND CORRELATE THE OCULAR BIOMETRIC PARAMETERS WITH THE IOP CHANGES, AND TO SCREEN FOR THE PREVALENCE OF OCULAR HYPERTENSION IN THIS GROUP OF SUBJECTS. DESIGN: PROSPECTIVE CASE OBSERVATIONAL SERIES. PARTICIPANTS: SEVENTY-FIVE SUBJECTS (50 ASIAN INDIANS AND 25 CAUCASIANS) FROM A YOGA TRAINING INSTITUTE VOLUNTEERED FOR THE STUDY. METHODS: ALL PARTICIPANTS UNDERWENT A DETAILED OPHTHALMIC EXAMINATION ALONG WITH OCULAR BIOMETRY AND CORNEAL PACHYMETRY. INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE WAS RECORDED USING A TONOPEN BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER THE SIRSASANA. CHANGES WERE COMPARED USING THE PAIRED T TEST. AGE, AXIAL LENGTH, ANTERIOR CHAMBER DEPTH, LENS THICKNESS, CORNEAL CURVATURE, CORNEAL THICKNESS, RACE, AND THE LENGTH OF TIME FOR WHICH THE PRACTITIONER WAS PERFORMING YOGA WERE CORRELATED WITH THE INDUCED IOP DIFFERENCE IN A RANDOMLY SELECTED EYE USING PEARSON'S CORRELATION COEFFICIENT WITH BONFERRONI CORRECTION FOR MULTIPLE COMPARISONS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: OCULAR BIOMETRY AND INDUCED IOP DIFFERENCE. RESULTS: THE MEAN INCREASE IN IOP AT BASELINE AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER ASSUMING SIRSASANA WAS 15.1+/-4.1 MMHG (R = 0.07; P = 0.999) AND AFTER 5 MINUTES WAS 15.8+/-4.6 MMHG (R = -0.25; P = 0.357). THE INDUCED INCREASE IN IOP DURING THE POSTURE WAS TWICE THE BASELINE IOP. THERE WAS NO CORRELATION BETWEEN AGE, OCULAR BIOMETRY, AND ULTRASOUND PACHYMETRY WHEN COMPARED WITH THE INDUCED IOP DIFFERENCE. ONE SUBJECT (1.33%) WAS FOUND TO HAVE BASELINE IOP OF MORE THAN 21 MMHG. CONCLUSION: THERE WAS A UNIFORM 2-FOLD INCREASE IN THE IOP DURING SIRSASANA, WHICH WAS MAINTAINED DURING THE POSTURE IN ALL AGE GROUPS IRRESPECTIVE OF THE OCULAR BIOMETRY AND ULTRASOUND PACHYMETRY. WE DID NOT DEMONSTRATE A HIGHER PREVALENCE OF OCULAR HYPERTENSIVES IN THIS COHORT OF YOGA PRACTITIONERS NOR DID THE RISK FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO GLAUCOMA SHOW ANY CORRELATION WITH MAGNITUDE OF IOP RAISE DURING THE POSTURE.	2006	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
2  706  34 EFFECT OF INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY ON MALE OBESITY AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS-A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: OBESITY IS A GROWING GLOBAL EPIDEMIC AND CAUSE OF NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. YOGA IS ONE OF THE EFFECTIVE WAYS TO REDUCE STRESS WHICH IS ONE OF THE CAUSES OF OBESITY. AIM: TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY (IAYT) YOGA MODULE ON ADULT MALE OBESITY IN AN URBAN SETTING. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RCT (RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL) WAS CONDUCTED FOR 14 WEEKS ON OBESE MALE SUBJECTS WITH YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS. TOTAL NUMBER OF SUBJECTS WERE 72 AND THEY WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS (YOGA N=37, CONTROL N=35). THE SUBJECTS WERE FROM AN URBAN SETTING OF MUMBAI AND WERE DOING YOGA FOR THE FIRST TIME. SPECIAL YOGA TRAINING OF IAYT WAS GIVEN TO YOGA GROUP FOR ONE AND HALF HOUR FOR 5 DAYS IN A WEEK FOR 14 WEEKS. THE CONTROL GROUP CONTINUED REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES AND NO SPECIFIC PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WAS GIVEN. THE ASSESSMENTS WERE ANTHROPOMETRIC PARAMETERS OF WEIGHT, BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), MAC (MID UPPER ARM CIRCUMFERENCES) OF LEFT AND RIGHT ARM, WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE (WC), HC (HIP CIRCUMFERENCE), WHR (WAIST HIP RATIO), SKF(SKIN FOLD THICKNESS OF BICEPS, TRICEPS, SUB SCAPULAR, SUPRAILIAC AND CUMULATIVE), PERCENTAGE BODY FAT BASED ON SKF AND PSYCHOLOGICAL QUESTIONNAIRES OF PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE (PSS) AND AAQW (ACCEPTANCE AND ACTION QUESTIONNAIRE FOR WEIGHT RELATED DIFFICULTY). THESE WERE TAKEN BEFORE AND AFTER INTERVENTION FOR BOTH YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS. WITHIN AND BETWEEN GROUP ANALYSIS & CORRELATION OF DIFFERENCES FROM POST TO PRE READINGS AMONG THE VARIABLES, WERE CARRIED OUT USING SPSS 21. RESULTS: THE ANTHROPOMETRIC AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS WERE IMPROVED IN BOTH THE GROUPS BUT CHANGES WERE SIGNIFICANT IN YOGA GROUP. CONCLUSION: INCORPORATING THE IAYT FOR OBESE MALE IN URBAN SETTING WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR OBESITY TREATMENT AND FOR REDUCING THE OBESITY RELATED PROBLEMS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
3 2741  39 YOGA PRACTICE FOR REDUCING THE MALE OBESITY AND WEIGHT RELATED PSYCHOLOGICAL DIFFICULTIES-A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: OBESITY IS A HEALTH DISORDER AND INCREASING ALL OVER THE WORLD. IT IS ALSO A CAUSE FOR MANY NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. YOGA PRACTICE REDUCES THE STRESS LEVEL WHICH MAY IMPROVE THE EATING HABITS AND HELP IN WEIGHT REDUCTION. AIM: TO ASSESS THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THE EFFECTS AFTER 3 MONTHS OF THE 14 WEEKS YOGA TRAINING ON OBESITY OF ADULT MALE IN AN URBAN SETTING. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS WAS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH PARALLEL GROUPS (YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS) ON MALE OBESE. TOTAL 80 SUBJECTS WITH BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) BETWEEN 25 TO 35 KG/CM(2) WERE ENROLLED AND RANDOMIZED INTO TWO EQUAL GROUPS IN WHICH 72 SUBJECTS (YOGA N = 37 AND CONTROL N=35) COMPLETED THE TRIAL. YOGA GROUP MEAN AGE +/- SD WAS 40.03+/-8.74 AND CONTROL GROUP MEAN AGE+/-SD WAS 42.20+/-12.06. A 14 WEEKS SPECIAL IAYT (INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY) YOGA TRAINING WAS GIVEN TO THE YOGA GROUP AND NO SPECIFIC ACTIVITY WAS GIVEN TO CONTROL GROUP. THE INTERIM RESULTS OF THIS STUDY AT 14 WEEKS WERE COVERED IN ANOTHER ARTICLE WHICH IS UNDER PROCESS. AFTER THE 14 WEEKS OF YOGA TRAINING THE YOGA GROUP WAS ASKED TO CONTINUE THE YOGA PRACTICE FOR THE NEXT 3 MONTHS AND THE CONTROL GROUP WAS NOT GIVEN ANY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. THE FINAL OUTCOME IS COVERED IN THIS PAPER. THE ASSESSMENTS WERE ANTHROPOMETRIC PARAMETERS OF BODY WEIGHT (WT), BMI (BODY MASS INDEX), MAC (MID-UPPER ARM CIRCUMFERENCES OF LEFT AND RIGHT ARM), WC (WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE), HC (HIP CIRCUMFERENCE), WHR (WAIST HIP RATIO), SKF (SKIN FOLD THICKNESS) OF BICEPS, TRICEPS, SUB SCAPULAR, SUPRAILIAC AND CUMULATIVE SKIN FOLD THICKNESS VALUE), PERCENTAGE BODY FAT BASED ON SKF AND PSYCHOLOGICAL QUESTIONNAIRES OF PSS (PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE) AND AAQW (ACCEPTANCE AND ACTION QUESTIONNAIRE FOR WEIGHT RELATED DIFFICULTY). ASSESSMENTS WERE TAKEN AFTER 3 MONTHS OF YOGA TRAINING, FOR BOTH YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS. WITHIN GROUP, BETWEEN GROUP AND CORRELATION ANALYSES WERE CARRIED OUT USING SPSS 21. RESULTS: IMPROVEMENT IN ANTHROPOMETRIC AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS SUCH AS WT, PERCENTAGE BODY FAT, PSS WERE OBSERVED IN THE FINAL OUTCOME. ALSO, SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS SUCH AS AAQW SCORE WERE LOST IN THE FINAL OUTCOME, COMPARED TO INTERIM RESULTS. CONCLUSION: THE YOGA PRACTICE IS EFFECTIVE FOR OBESITY CONTROL FOR ADULT MALE IN AN URBAN SETTING.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
4  649  35 DYNAMIC EVALUATION OF THE CONTRACTILE FUNCTION OF LUMBODORSAL MUSCLES DURING LOCUST POSE IN YOGA BY REAL-TIME ULTRASOUND. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP), WHICH HAS A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH LUMBAR MUSCLE DEGENERATION, CAN BE EFFECTIVELY TREATED BY EXERCISE THERAPY, AND YOGA HAS BEEN WIDELY ACCEPTED BY CLINICIANS AND PATIENTS WITH CLBP. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO OBSERVE THE CHANGES IN THE THICKNESS OF LUMBODORSAL MUSCLES THAT OCCUR DURING LOCUST POSE IN YOGA AND HOW THESE CHANGES OCCUR. FROM THE CHANGES IN MUSCLE THICKNESS THAT OCCUR IN THE LOCUST POSE, THE CONTRACTILE FUNCTION OF LUMBODORSAL MUSCLES CAN BE EVALUATED. METHODS: FIFTY-TWO HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS (FROM MAY 2019 TO AUGUST 2019, AGE FROM 28 TO 68 YEARS, 23 MALES AND 29 FEMALES (AGE: 40 +/- 8 YEARS; WEIGHT: 68.3 +/- 5.2 KG; HEIGHT: 170.2 +/- 13.1 CM) WERE RECRUITED, AND LUMBODORSAL MUSCLE, INCLUDING THE MULTIFIDUS, LONGISSIMUS, ILIOCOSTALIS, AND QUADRATUS LUMBORUM, ULTRASONIC EXAMINATIONS WERE CARRIED OUT IN THE RELAXED AND CONTRACTED STATES. THE CHANGES IN THE THICKNESS OF THE LUMBODORSAL MUSCLES IN THE RELAXED AND CONTRACTED STATES WERE DYNAMICALLY OBSERVED BY REAL-TIME ULTRASOUND WHEN SUBJECTS WERE PERFORMING THE LOCUST YOGA POSE. THEN, THE THICKNESSES OF THE MUSCLES DURING THE TWO STATES WERE MEASURED TO CALCULATE THE RATIO OF CONTRACTION OF EACH MUSCLE AND DETERMINE THE STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CHANGE IN THICKNESS OF EACH MUSCLE. RESULTS: THE MEAN THICKNESS OF THE LEFT MULTIFIDUS IN THE RELAXED STATE WAS 1.32 +/- 0.27 CM (95 % CI: 1.24 ~ 1.39), THAT IN THE CONTRACTED STATE WAS 1.60 +/- 0.30 CM (95 % CI: 1.52 ~ 1.69) (OBVIOUSLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE RELAXED AND CONTRACTED STATES, P < 0.001), AND THOSE IN THE CORRESPONDING RIGHT SIDE WERE 1.37 +/- 0.31 CM (95 % CI: 1.29 ~ 2.46) AND 1.68 +/- 0.38 CM (95 % CI: 1.58 ~ 1.79) (P < 0.001), RESPECTIVELY. THE MEAN THICKNESS OF THE LEFT QUADRATUS LUMBORUM IN THE RELAXED STATE WAS 1.38 +/- 0.32 CM (95 % CI: 1.29 ~ 1.47), THAT IN THE CONTRACTED STATE WAS 1.62 +/- 0.40 CM (95 % CI: 1.50 ~ 1.73) (P = 0.001), AND THOSE IN THE CORRESPONDING RIGHT SIDE WERE 1.30 +/- 0.32 CM (95 % CI: 1.21 ~ 1.39) AND 1.55 +/- 0.41 CM (95 % CI: 1.44 ~ 1.67) (P = 0.001), RESPECTIVELY. THE MEAN THICKNESS OF THE LEFT LONGISSIMUS IN THE RELAXED WAS 2.33 +/- 0.51 CM (95 % CI: 2.19 ~ 2.47), THAT IN THE CONTRACTED STATE WAS 3.20 +/- 0.61 CM (95 % CI: 3.03 ~ 3.37) (P < 0.001), AND THOSE IN THE CORRESPONDING RIGHT SIDE WERE 2.34 +/- 0.49 CM (95 % CI 2.20 ~ 2.48) AND 3.26 +/- 0.68 CM (95 % CI 3.07 ~ 3.45) (P < 0.001), RESPECTIVELY. THE MEAN THICKNESS OF THE LEFT ILIOCOSTALIS IN THE RELAXED STATE WAS 1.88 +/- 0.41 CM (95 % CI: 1.76 ~ 1.99), THAT IN THE CONTRACTED STATE WAS 2.34 +/- 0.49 CM (95 % CI: 2.00 ~ 2.47) (P < 0.001), AND THOSE IN THE CORRESPONDING RIGHT SIDE WERE 1.98 +/- 0.40 CM (95 % CI: 1.87 ~ 2.09) AND 2.44 +/- 0.56 CM (95 % CI: 2.29 ~ 2.60) (P < 0.001), RESPECTIVELY. THE MEAN CONTRACTED STATE/RESTING STATE (C/R) OF THE LONGISSIMUS WAS 1.39 +/- 0.14 ON THE LEFT AND 1.40 +/- 0.16 ON THE RIGHT. THE MULTIFIDUS AND ILIOCOSTALIS HAD THE SECOND HIGHEST C/R. THE MEAN C/R OF THE MULTIFIDUS WAS 1.23 +/- 0.12 ON THE LEFT AND 1.24 +/- 0.15 ON THE RIGHT, AND THE MEAN C/R OF THE ILIOCOSTALIS WAS 1.25 +/- 0.12 ON THE LEFT AND 1.24 +/- 0.14 ON THE RIGHT. THE QUADRATUS LUMBORUM HAD THE LOWEST C/R, AND THE MEAN C/R OF THE QUADRATUS LUMBORUM WAS 1.17 +/- 0.10 ON THE LEFT AND 1.19 +/- 0.11 ON THE RIGHT. CONCLUSIONS: ULTRASOUND CAN BE USED TO DYNAMICALLY ASSESS THE CONTRACTILE FUNCTION OF THE LUMBAR MUSCLE IN THE LOCUST POSE OF YOGA, THE C/R RATIO CAN BE USED TO INDICATE THE ABILITY OF A MUSCLE TO CONTRACT, AND DYNAMIC ULTRASOUND CAN GUIDE LUMBAR EXERCISE AND FEEDBACK THE EXERCISE RESULTS. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS MODEL ALLOWED DATA REGARDING THE CONTRACTION STATE OF THE LUMBAR MUSCLE TO BE OBTAINED IN A NORMAL POPULATION, AND BASED ON THIS, FUTURE STUDIES CAN FURTHER EXPLORE AND EVALUATE THE CONTRACTION STATE OF THE LUMBAR MUSCLE AFTER YOGA EXERCISE IN CLBP PATIENTS, THE EFFECT EXERCISE ON LUMBAR INSTABILITY AND ON A PATIENT POPULATION AFTER LUMBAR OPERATION.	2021	

5 1981  31 SLEEP QUALITY AND BODY COMPOSITION VARIATIONS IN OBESE MALE ADULTS AFTER 14 WEEKS OF YOGA INTERVENTION: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: OBESITY IS A BIG CHALLENGE ALL OVER THE WORLD. IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH MANY NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES. YOGA KNOWN TO BE ADD-ON TREATMENT MAY BE EFFECTIVE FOR OBESITY CONTROL. AIM: TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY (IAYT) FOR BODY COMPOSITION AND QUALITY OF SLEEP IN ADULT OBESE MALE. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED FOR 14 WEEKS ON OBESE MALE OF URBAN SETTING. EIGHTY INDIVIDUALS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS, I.E., YOGA GROUP (N = 40; AGE; 40.03 +/- 8.74 YEARS, BODY MASS INDEX [BMI] 28.7 +/- 2.35 KG/M(2)) AND CONTROL GROUP (AGE; 42.20 +/- 12.06 YEARS, BMI 27.70 +/- 2.05 KG/M(2)). THE IAYT WAS IMPARTED TO YOGA GROUP FOR 1(1/2) HOUR FOR 5 DAYS IN A WEEK FOR 14 WEEKS. THE CONTROL GROUP CONTINUED THEIR REGULAR ACTIVITIES. THE BODY COMPOSITION BY INBODY R20 AND SLEEP QUALITY BY PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI) WERE ASSESSED. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS DONE FOR WITHIN AND BETWEEN GROUPS USING SPSS VERSION 21. THE CORRELATION ANALYSIS WAS DONE ON THE DIFFERENCE IN PRE-POST VALUES. RESULTS: THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT WEIGHT (P = 0.004), BMI (P = 0.008), BONE MASS (P = 0.017), OBESITY DEGREE (P = 0.005), AND MINERAL MASS (P = 0.046) WERE IMPROVED IN YOGA GROUP AND NO CHANGE IN CONTROL GROUP (P > 0.05). THE GLOBAL SCORE OF PSQI IMPROVED (P = 0.017) IN YOGA GROUP ALONE. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS INDICATE THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF IAYT ON BODY COMPOSITION AND SLEEP QUALITY IN OBESE MALES. THE YOGA PRACTICE MAY REDUCE OBESITY WITH THE IMPROVEMENT IN QUALITY OF LIFE.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
6 2756  39 YOGA PRACTICE TO IMPROVE SLEEP QUALITY AND BODY COMPOSITION PARAMETERS OF OBESE MALE - A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND GLOBALLY OBESITY INCREASE IS A BIG CHALLENGE. OBESITY CAUSES MANY NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. OPTIONS TO CONTROL OBESITY ARE IN SEARCH. AIM: TO ASSESS THE OUTCOME OF 3 MONTHS FOLLOW-UP PERIOD, AFTER 14 WEEKS YOGA INTERVENTION, FOR BODY COMPOSITION AND SLEEP QUALITY PARAMETERS ON OBESE MALE IN URBAN SETTING. MATERIALS AND METHODS DESIGN: PARALLEL GROUP RCT (RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL) ON OBESE MALE. THE TWO GROUPS WERE YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS, WITH YOGA (N = 37, AGE 40.03 +/- 8.74), CONTROL (N = 35, AGE 42.20 +/- 12.06). THE IAYT (INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY) TRAINING WAS GIVEN TO YOGA GROUP FOR 14 WEEKS, AND THE UNSUPERVISED YOGA PRACTICE WAS CONTINUED BY THE SUBJECTS AT THEIR HOME, FOR FURTHER 3 MONTHS. TRAINING WAS 1.5 HOUR DAILY FOR 5 DAYS IN A WEEK, WHICH INCLUDED THE IAYT MODULE OF SURYANAMASKARA ASANA PRANAYAMA AND RELAXATION. NO YOGA ACTIVITY BUT WALKING ETC. FOR THE SAME TIME, WAS GIVEN TO CONTROL GROUP. BODY COMPOSITION PARAMETERS WERE ASSESSED THROUGH BIA (BIOELECTRICAL IMPEDANCE) METHOD USING INBODY R 20 MODEL. THE SLEEP QUALITY WAS ASSESSED USING PSQI (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX). WITHIN GROUP AND BETWEEN GROUP ANALYSIS WERE PERFORMED, USING SPSS VERSION 21. THE CORRELATION ANALYSIS WAS CARRIED OUT ON THE DIFFERENCE IN PRE FOLLOW-UP VALUES. RESULTS DURING THE FOLLOW-UP PERIOD WITHIN THE GROUP, THE BODY COMPOSITION PARAMETERS IMPROVED AND THE PARAMETERS OF QUALITY OF SLEEP SHOWED TRENDS OF IMPROVEMENT. ALSO SOME OF THE GAIN OBTAINED DURING 14 WEEKS INTERVENTION WAS LOST DURING FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. CONCLUSIONS THE CHANGES OBSERVED MAY INDICATE THE LONG-TERM BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE FOR CONTROL OF OBESITY IN URBAN SETTING FOR MALES.	2018

8 1014  33 EFFECTS OF PILATES AND YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC NECK PAIN: A SONOGRAPHIC STUDY. BACKGROUND: VARIOUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THE EFFICACY OF CONVENTIONAL ISOMETRIC, PILATES AND YOGA EXERCISES. HOWEVER, DATA ON THE EFFECTS AND COMPARISON OF THESE SPECIFIC EXERCISES ON THE CERVICAL MUSCLE MORPHOLOGY ARE INSUFFICIENT OR LACKING. OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT EXERCISE TREATMENTS ON NECK MUSCLES IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC NECK PAIN. DESIGN: A RANDOMIZED STUDY. METHODS: FIFTY-SIX PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC NECK PAIN WERE RANDOMIZED INTO 3 GROUPS AS FOLLOWS: PILATES GROUP (N = 20), YOGA GROUP (N = 18) AND ISOMETRIC GROUP (N = 18). DEMOGRAPHICS AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION WERE RECORDED. THE THICKNESS AND CROSS-SECTIONAL AREA OF NECK MUSCLES WERE EVALUATED BY ULTRASOUND IMAGING. CERVICAL MOTIONS WERE MEASURED WITH A GONIOMETER. PAIN SEVERITY WAS EVALUATED WITH THE MCGILL PAIN SCALE, DISABILITY WITH THE NECK DISABILITY INDEX, QUALITY OF LIFE WITH THE NOTTINGHAM HEALTH PROFILE, AND EMOTIONAL STATUS WITH THE BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY. IN ADDITION TO A CONVENTIONAL PHYSIO-THERAPY PROGRAMME, 15 SESSIONS OF PHYSICAL THERAPY, INCLUDING HOT PACK, ULTRASOUND, AND TRANSCUTANEOUS ELECTRICAL NERVE STIMULATION (TENS), WERE PROVIDED TO ALL PATIENTS. ALL GROUPS PERFORMED THE EXERCISES FOR 6 WEEKS. THE AFOREMENTIONED ASSESSMENTS WERE PERFORMED BEFORE AND 6 WEEKS AFTER THE TREATMENT. RESULTS: ALTHOUGH PAIN, DISABILITY, DEPRESSION AND QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVED SIMILARLY WITHIN ALL GROUPS (ALL P < 0.05), MUSCLE THICKNESS VALUES AS REGARDS THE SEMISPINALIS CAPITIS WERE INCREASED ONLY IN THE PILATES GROUP (P = 0.022). STUDY LIMITATIONS: THE LACK OF COMPLEX (PROGRESSIVE RESISTIVE) EXERCISE TREATMENT PROTOCOLS, SHORT TREATMENT DURATION AND PARTIAL SUPERVISION. CONCLUSION: ALL 3 TYPES OF EXERCISE HAD FAVOURABLE EFFECTS ON PAIN AND FUNCTIONAL SCORES, BUT NO DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND AMONG THE GROUPS, EXCEPT FOR THE PILATES GROUP, IN WHICH THE SEMISPINALIS CAPITIS MUSCLE INCREASED IN THICKNESS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
9  881  34 EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES AND C-REACTIVE PROTEIN IN EMPLOYEES OF SMALL-SCALE INDUSTRIES. OBJECTIVE: THE PRESENT STUDY INTENDS TO SEE THE EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICES ON LIPID PROFILE, INTERLEUKIN (IL)-6, TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR (TNF)-ALPHA, AND HIGH-SENSITIVITY-C-REACTIVE PROTEIN (HS-CRP) AMONG APPARENTLY HEALTHY ADULTS EXPOSED TO OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IN THE PRESENT STUDY, 48 PARTICIPANTS AGED 30-58 YEARS (41.5 +/- 5.2) WHO WERE EXPOSED TO OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS, THAT IS, EXPERIMENTAL AND WAIT-LIST CONTROL. ALL THE PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSESSED FOR LIPID PROFILE, IL-6, TNF-ALPHA, AND HS-CRP AT THE BASELINE AND AFTER COMPLETION OF 3 MONTHS OF YOGA TRAINING INTERVENTION. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP UNDERWENT YOGA TRAINING INTERVENTION FOR 1 H FOR 6 DAYS A WEEK FOR 3 MONTHS, WHEREAS CONTROL GROUP CONTINUED WITH THEIR DAILY ACTIVITIES EXCEPT YOGA TRAINING. DATA ANALYSIS WAS DONE USING STATISTICAL SOFTWARE SPSS VERSION 20.0. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING PAIRED T-TESTS AND INDEPENDENT T-TEST. RESULTS: THE RESULTS OF WITHIN GROUP COMPARISON REVEALED HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN CHOLESTEROL (P < 0.001), HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (P < 0.001), LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (LDL)(P < 0.01), HS-CRP (P < 0.01), IL-6 (P < 0.001), AND TNF-ALPHA (P < 0.001) IN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP. COMPARISON BETWEEN EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUP REVEALED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN CHOLESTEROL (P < 0.01), LDL (P < 0.05), IL-6 (P < 0.01), TNF-ALPHA (P < 0.01), AND HS-CRP (P < 0.01).

10  553  38 CORRELATION OF HEART RATE VARIABILITY WITH CAROTID INTIMA MEDIA THICKNESS AFTER 6 MONTH OF YOGA INTERVENTION IN PREDIABETICS. INTRODUCTION: ATHEROSCLEROTIC CAROTID INTIMAMEDIA THICKNESS (CIMT) MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH ALTERATIONS IN THE AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF 6-MONTH YOGA INTERVENTION ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) AND CIMT IN ELDERLY SUBJECTS AND THE CORRELATION BETWEEN HRV AND CIMT. METHODOLOGY: THIS WAS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY, IN WHICH A TOTAL OF 250 SUBJECTS WERE ENROLLED. RANDOMIZATION AND ALLOCATION IN YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS WERE PERFORMED USING COMPUTER-GENERATED RANDOM NUMBERS. THE CIMT WAS DETERMINED BY B-MODE ULTRASONOGRAPHY, AND CARDIAC AUTONOMIC FUNCTION WAS DETERMINED THROUGH FREQUENCY DOMAIN PARAMETER OF HRV MEASURES AT BASELINE AND AFTER 6 MONTHS OF YOGA INTERVENTION. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS HAD A MEAN AGE OF 45.4 +/- 6.4 YEARS, AND A MEAN CIMT IN CONTROL (0.70 +/- 0.05) AND STUDY GROUP (0.69 +/- 0.073), AND LOW FREQUENCY/HIGH FREQUENCY (LF/HF) RATIO IN CONTROL (2.20 +/- 1.05) AND STUDY GROUP (0.57 +/- 0.54). YOGA GROUP HAD EVIDENCE OF INCREASED VAGAL ACTIVITY IN THE FREQUENCY DOMAIN (HF AND LF/HF RATIO, P < 0.001) WITH RESPECT TO CONTROL GROUP. MOREOVER, A STUDY GROUP SHOWED LOWER INTIMAMEDIA THICKNESS (IMT) THAN CONTROL SUBJECTS (P < 0.01). IN THE WHOLE POPULATION, LF/HF RATIO POSITIVELY AND SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED (R = 0.665, P < 0.01) TO IMT. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT, AFTER YOGA INTERVENTION, LF/HF RATIO IS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH CIMT, A PUTATIVE INDEX OF ATHEROSCLEROSIS, CONFIRMING CARDIAC AUTONOMIC NEUROPATHY AS A PART OF THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL PATHWAY FOR ATHEROSCLEROSIS. IT CONFIRMS THAT THE REGULAR YOGA REPRESENTS A VALUABLE STRATEGY TO COUNTER IMPAIRMENTS OF CARDIAC AUTONOMIC ACTIVITY AND ARTERY STRUCTURAL CHANGES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
11 1317  31 HEART RATE VARIABILITY CHANGES DURING HIGH FREQUENCY YOGA BREATHING AND BREATH AWARENESS. BACKGROUND: PRE AND POST COMPARISON AFTER ONE MINUTE OF HIGH FREQUENCY YOGA BREATHING (HFYB) SUGGESTED THAT THE HFYB MODIFIES THE AUTONOMIC STATUS BY INCREASING SYMPATHETIC MODULATION, BUT ITS EFFECT DURING THE PRACTICE WAS NOT ASSESSED. METHODS: THIRTY-EIGHT MALE VOLUNTEERS WITH GROUP AVERAGE AGE +/- S.D., 23.3 +/- 4.4 YEARS WERE EACH ASSESSED ON TWO SEPARATE DAYS IN TWO SESSIONS, (I) HFYB AND (II) BREATH AWARENESS. EACH SESSION WAS FOR 35 MINUTES, WITH 3 PERIODS, I.E., PRE (5 MINUTES), DURING HFYB OR BREATH AWARENESS (15 MINUTES) AND POST (5 MINUTES). RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN NN50, PNN50 AND THE MEAN RR INTERVAL DURING AND AFTER HFYB AND AFTER BREATH AWARENESS, COMPARED TO THE RESPECTIVE 'PRE' VALUES (P < 0.05) (REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA FOLLOWED BY POST-HOC ANALYSIS). THE LF POWER INCREASED AND HF POWER DECREASED DURING AND AFTER BREATH AWARENESS AND LF/HF RATIO INCREASED AFTER BREATH AWARENESS (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THERE WAS REDUCED PARASYMPATHETIC MODULATION DURING AND AFTER HFYB AND INCREASED SYMPATHETIC MODULATION WITH REDUCED PARASYMPATHETIC MODULATION DURING AND AFTER BREATH AWARENESS.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
12   50  28 A COMPARATIVE CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND WALKING FOR OVERWEIGHT AND OBESE ADULTS. BACKGROUND: WALKING AND YOGA HAVE BEEN INDEPENDENTLY EVALUATED FOR WEIGHT CONTROL; HOWEVER, THERE ARE VERY FEW STUDIES COMPARING THE 2 WITH RANDOMIZATION. MATERIAL AND METHODS: THE PRESENT STUDY COMPARED THE EFFECTS OF 90 MINUTES/DAY FOR 15 DAYS OF SUPERVISED YOGA OR SUPERVISED WALKING ON: (I) RELATED BIOCHEMISTRY, (II) ANTHROPOMETRIC VARIABLES, (III) BODY COMPOSITION, (IV) POSTURAL STABILITY, AND (V) BILATERAL HAND GRIP STRENGTH IN OVERWEIGHT AND OBESE PERSONS. SIXTY-EIGHT PARTICIPANTS, OF WHOM 5 WERE OVERWEIGHT (BMI >/=25 KG/M2) AND 63 WERE OBESE (BMI >/=30 KG/M2; GROUP MEAN AGE +/-S.D., 36.4+/-11.2 YEARS; 35 FEMALES), WERE RANDOMIZED AS 2 GROUPS - (I) A YOGA GROUP AND (II) A WALKING GROUP - GIVEN THE SAME DIET. RESULTS: ALL DIFFERENCES WERE PRE-POST CHANGES WITHIN EACH GROUP. BOTH GROUPS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT (P<0.05; REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA, POST-HOC ANALYSES) DECREASE IN: BMI, WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE, HIP CIRCUMFERENCE, LEAN MASS, BODY WATER, AND TOTAL CHOLESTEROL. THE YOGA GROUP INCREASED SERUM LEPTIN (P<0.01) AND DECREASED LDL CHOLESTEROL (P<0.05). THE WALKING GROUP DECREASED SERUM ADIPONECTIN (P<0.05) AND TRIGLYCERIDES (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: BOTH YOGA AND WALKING IMPROVED ANTHROPOMETRIC VARIABLES AND SERUM LIPID PROFILE IN OVERWEIGHT AND OBESE PERSONS. THE POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
13 1102  34 EFFECTS OF YOGA TRAINING ON BODY COMPOSITION AND OXIDANT-ANTIOXIDANT STATUS AMONG HEALTHY MALE. BACKGROUND: THE STRESSFUL CONDITION MAY CAUSE OXIDATIVE STRESS, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR VARIOUS DISEASES. AIMS: THE PRESENT STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO FIND OUT WHETHER YOGA HAS IMPACT ON THE REDUCTION OF OXIDATIVE STRESS. METHODS: FOR THE PRESENT STUDY, 95 (N = 95) HEALTHY MALE VOLUNTEERS WITHIN THE AGE GROUP OF 18-24 YEARS WERE INCLUDED, 35 (N = 35) VOLUNTEERS WERE EXCLUDED. THE REMAINING 60 (N = 60) VOLUNTEERS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: (A) YOGA GROUP (N = 30) AND (B) CONTROL GROUP (N = 30). YOGA TRAINING WAS GIVEN FOR 60 MIN PER DAY, 6 DAYS PER WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS IN THE YOGA GROUP, WITH NO YOGA TRAINING IN CONTROL GROUP. ASSESSMENT OF BODY COMPOSITION AND OXIDANT-ANTIOXIDANT STATUS WERE PERFORMED IN BOTH THE GROUPS AT BASELINE, BEFORE YOGA TRAINING (0 WEEK) AND AFTER (12 WEEKS) OF THE TRAINING. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION (P < 0.001) IN THE PERCENTAGE OF BODY FAT AND MALONDIALDEHYDE; SIGNIFICANT ELEVATION (P < 0.001) IN SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE, CATALASE, REDUCED GLUTATHIONE AND ASCORBIC ACID LEVELS WERE NOTED IN THE YOGA GROUP AFTER 12 WEEKS WHEN COMPARED TO BASELINE DATA (0 WEEK). HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN HEIGHT, WEIGHT, BODY MASS INDEX, BODY SURFACE AREA AND LEAN BODY MASS AMONG THE YOGA GROUP AFTER 12 WEEKS WHEN COMPARED TO BASELINE DATA. THESE CHANGES MIGHT BE DUE TO YOGA TRAINING. CONCLUSIONS: REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE REDUCES BODY FAT AND OXIDATIVE STRESS. YOGA TRAINING MAY BE HELPFUL TO REDUCE THE CHANCE OF OCCURRENCE OF VARIOUS DISEASES AND HELPS TO MAINTAIN NORMAL HEALTHY LIFESTYLE.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
14  324  27 ANTHROPOMETRIC, BIOCHEMICAL AND CLINICAL PARAMETERS IN CLIMACTERIC YOGA PRACTITIONERS. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE ANTHROPOMETRIC, BIOCHEMICAL AND CLINICAL PARAMETERS IN CLIMACTERIC YOGA PRACTITIONERS. METHODS: THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED 108 CLIMACTERIC WOMEN. WE RECRUITED 28 WOMEN BETWEEN 40 AND 65 YEARS OLD WHO STARTED YOGA PRACTICES IN PREMENOPAUSE AND HAD ALREADY PRACTICED FOR AT LEAST 5 YEARS. AS CONTROLS, WE SELECTED 30 PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (PA) PRACTITIONERS WHO HAD PRACTICED FOR AT LEAST 5 YEARS AND 50 SEDENTARY WOMEN IN THE SAME AGE RANGE. WE CONDUCED ANTHROPOMETRIC, BIOCHEMICAL AND BLOOD PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS. RESULTS: THE YOGA GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE THAN THE PA PRACTITIONERS AND SEDENTARY WOMEN. YOGA PRACTITIONERS ALSO HAD LOWER WEIGHT, BODY MASS INDEX, WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE, BODY FAT PERCENTAGE AND WAIST-TO-HEIGHT RATIO; HIGHER LEVELS OF HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL; LOWER LEVELS OF TRIGLYCERIDES, INSULIN, HOMEOSTASIS MODEL ASSESSMENT OF INSULIN RESISTANCE, URIC ACID, APOLIPOPROTEIN B AND HIGH-SENSITIVITY C-REACTIVE PROTEIN; AND LOWER FREQUENCY OF METABOLIC SYNDROME, LIPID ACCUMULATION PRODUCT, VISCERAL ADIPOSITY INDEX AND SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE THAN THE SEDENTARY WOMEN. CONCLUSION: YOGA PRACTITIONERS HAD LOWER GLUCOSE SERUM CONCENTRATIONS THAN THE PA PRACTITIONERS AND SEDENTARY WOMEN. OVERALL, THE YOGA GROUP ALSO HAD BETTER ANTHROPOMETRIC, BIOCHEMICAL AND CLINICAL VARIABLES THAN THE OTHER GROUPS. ALTHOUGH FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS REQUIRED, YOGA PRACTICE IN PREMENOPAUSE SEEMS TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR WOMEN WHEN THEY REACH MENOPAUSE.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
15 2507  36 YOGA BASED CARDIAC REHABILITATION AFTER CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS SURGERY: ONE-YEAR RESULTS ON LVEF, LIPID PROFILE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STATES--A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO COMPARE THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA BASED CARDIAC REHABILITATION PROGRAM WITH ONLY PHYSIOTHERAPY BASED PROGRAM AS AN ADD-ON TO CONVENTIONAL REHABILITATION AFTER CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING (CABG) ON RISK FACTORS. METHODS: IN THIS SINGLE BLIND PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED PARALLEL TWO ARMED ACTIVE CONTROL STUDY, 1026 PATIENTS POSTED FOR CABG AT NARAYANA HRUDAYALAYA INSTITUTE OF CARDIAC SCIENCES, BENGALURU (INDIA) WERE SCREENED. OF THESE, 250 MALE PARTICIPANTS (35-65 YEARS) WHO SATISFIED THE SELECTION CRITERIA AND CONSENTED WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS. WITHIN AND BETWEEN GROUP COMPARISONS WERE DONE AT THREE POINTS OF FOLLOW UP (I.E. 6TH WEEK, 6TH MONTH, AND 12TH MONTH) BY USING WILCOXON'S SIGNED RANKS TEST AND MANN WHITNEY U TEST RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS: YOGA GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY (P = 0.001, MANN WHITNEY) BETTER IMPROVEMENT IN LVEF THAN CONTROL GROUP IN THOSE WITH ABNORMAL BASELINE EF (<53%) AFTER 1 YEAR. THERE WAS A BETTER REDUCTION IN BMI IN THE YOGA GROUP (P = 0.038, BETWEEN GROUPS) IN THOSE WITH HIGH BASELINE BMI (>/=23) AFTER 12 MONTHS. YOGA GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT (P = 0.008, WILCOXON'S) REDUCTION IN BLOOD GLUCOSE AT ONE YEAR IN THOSE WITH HIGH BASELINE FBS >/=110 MG/DL. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER IMPROVEMENT IN YOGA THAN THE CONTROL GROUP IN HDL (P = 0.003), LDL (P = 0.01) AND VLDL (P = 0.03) IN THOSE WITH ABNORMAL BASELINE VALUES. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER IMPROVEMENT (P = 0.02, BETWEEN GROUPS) IN POSITIVE AFFECT IN YOGA GROUP. WITHIN YOGA GROUP, THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN PERCEIVED STRESS (P = 0.001), ANXIETY (P = 0.001), DEPRESSION (P = 0.001), AND NEGATIVE AFFECT (P = 0.03) WHILE IN THE CONTROL GROUP THERE WAS REDUCTION (P = 0.003) ONLY IN SCORES ON ANXIETY. CONCLUSION: ADDITION OF YOGA BASED RELAXATION TO CONVENTIONAL POST-CABG CARDIAC REHABILITATION HELPS IN BETTER MANAGEMENT OF RISK FACTORS IN THOSE WITH ABNORMAL BASELINE VALUES AND MAY HELP IN PREVENTING RECURRENCE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
16 2242  31 THE INFLUENCE OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND YOGA ON CENTRAL ARTERIAL STIFFNESS. PURPOSE: CENTRAL ARTERIAL STIFFNESS IS AN ACCEPTED RISK FACTOR FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. WHILE AEROBIC ACTIVITY IS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED STIFFNESS THE INFLUENCE OF PRACTICING YOGA IS UNKNOWN. THE AIMS OF THIS STUDY WERE TO: 1) EVALUATE ARTERIAL STIFFNESS IN MIDDLE-AGED ADULTS WHO REGULARLY PRACTICED YOGA, PERFORMED REGULAR EXERCISE, OR WERE INACTIVE, 2) EVALUATE THE REPRODUCIBILITY OF ARTERIAL STIFFNESS MEASURED IN THE LEFT AND RIGHT CAROTID ARTERY AND BY PULSE WAVE VELOCITY (PWV). METHODS: TWENTY SIX HEALTHY SUBJECTS (MALE AND FEMALE, 40-65 YRS OLD) WERE TESTED ON TWO SEPARATE DAYS. CAROTID ARTERY DISTENSIBILITY (DC) WAS MEASURED WITH ULTRASOUND. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WAS DETERMINED BY QUESTIONNAIRE. RESULTS: YOGA AND AEROBIC SUBJECTS HAD SIMILAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY LEVELS. YOGA AND AEROBIC GROUPS WERE NOT DIFFERENT IN EITHER DC (P = 0.26) OR PWV (P = 0.21). THE SEDENTARY GROUP HAD LOWER DC AND HIGHER PWV COMPARED TO THE AEROBIC AND YOGA GROUPS (BOTH, P < 0.001). STIFFNESS MEASURES WERE RELIABLE DAY TO DAY (COEFFICIENTS OF VARIATION APPROXIMATELY 2.5%) AND SIMILAR BETWEEN LEFT AND RIGHT ARTERIES (CV = 2.2%). CONCLUSION: PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WAS A STRONG PREDICTOR OF BOTH MEASURES OF ARTERIAL STIFFNESS, ALTHOUGH OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS NUTRITIONAL STATUS NEED TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR. AN INDEPENDENT EFFECT OF PRACTICING YOGA COULD NOT BE DETECTED. STIFFNESS MEASURES WERE REPRODUCIBLE AND LEFT AND RIGHT SIDES WERE CONSISTENT WITH EACH OTHER.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
17 1578  34 MEASUREMENT OF THE EFFECT OF ISHA YOGA ON CARDIAC AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM USING SHORT-TERM HEART RATE VARIABILITY. BACKGROUND: BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA HAVE BEEN POSTULATED TO BE DUE TO MODULATION OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM. OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF ISHA YOGA PRACTICES ON CARDIOVASCULAR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THROUGH SHORT-TERM HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV). DESIGN OF THE STUDY: SHORT-TERM HRV OF LONG-TERM REGULAR HEALTHY 14 (12 MALES AND 2 FEMALES) ISHA YOGA PRACTITIONERS WAS COMPARED WITH THAT OF AGE- AND GENDER-MATCHED 14 (12 MALES AND 2 FEMALES) NON-YOGA PRACTITIONERS. METHODS AND MATERIALS: ECG LEAD II AND RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS WERE RECORDED IN BOTH GROUPS USING POLYRITE DURING SUPINE REST FOR 5 MIN AND CONTROLLED DEEP BREATHING FOR 1 MINUTE. FREQUENCY DOMAIN ANALYSIS [RR INTERVAL IS THE MEAN OF DISTANCE BETWEEN SUBSEQUENT R WAVE PEAKS IN ECG], LOW FREQUENCY (LF) POWER, HIGH FREQUENCY (HF) POWER, LF NORMALIZED UNITS (NU), HF NU, LF/HF RATIO] AND TIME DOMAIN ANALYSIS [STANDARD DEVIATION OF NORMAL TO NORMAL INTERVAL (SDNN), SQUARE OF MEAN SQUARED DIFFERENCE OF SUCCESSIVE NORMAL TO NORMAL INTERVALS (RMSSD), NORMAL TO NORMAL INTERVALS WHICH ARE DIFFERING BY 50 MS (NN50), AND PERCENTAGE OF NN50 (PNN50)] OF HRV VARIABLES WERE ANALYZED FOR SUPINE REST. TIME DOMAIN ANALYSIS WAS RECORDED FOR DEEP BREATHING. RESULTS: RESULTS SHOWED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ISHA YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND CONTROLS IN BOTH FREQUENCY AND TIME DOMAIN ANALYSES OF HRV INDICES, WITH NO DIFFERENCE IN RESTING HEART RATE BETWEEN THE GROUPS. CONCLUSIONS: PRACTITIONERS OF ISHA YOGA SHOWED WELL-BALANCED BENEFICIAL ACTIVITY OF VAGAL EFFERENTS, AN OVERALL INCREASED HRV, AND SYMPATHOVAGAL BALANCE, COMPARED TO NON-YOGA PRACTITIONERS DURING SUPINE REST AND DEEP BREATHING.	2012

YOGA, A MIND-BODY ACTIVITY THAT REQUIRES ATTENTIONAL ENGAGEMENT, HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH POSITIVE CHANGES IN BRAIN STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION, ESPECIALLY IN AREAS RELATED TO AWARENESS, ATTENTION, EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS AND MEMORY. NORMAL AGING, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAS ALSO BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL BRAIN CHANGES, BUT THESE GENERALLY INVOLVE DECREASED COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS. THE AIM OF THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS TO COMPARE BRAIN CORTICAL THICKNESS (CT) IN ELDERLY YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND A GROUP OF AGE-MATCHED HEALTHY NON-PRACTITIONERS. WE TESTED 21 OLDER WOMEN WHO HAD PRACTICED HATHA YOGA FOR AT LEAST 8 YEARS AND 21 WOMEN NAIVE TO YOGA, MEDITATION OR ANY MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS WHO WERE MATCHED TO THE FIRST GROUP IN AGE, YEARS OF FORMAL EDUCATION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY LEVEL. A T1-WEIGHTED MPRAGE SEQUENCE WAS ACQUIRED FOR EACH PARTICIPANT. YOGA PRACTITIONERS SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER CT IN A LEFT PREFRONTAL LOBE CLUSTER, WHICH INCLUDED PORTIONS OF THE LATERAL MIDDLE FRONTAL GYRUS, ANTERIOR SUPERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS AND DORSAL SUPERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS. WE FOUND GREATER CT IN THE LEFT PREFRONTAL CORTEX OF HEALTHY ELDERLY WOMEN WHO TRAINED YOGA FOR A MINIMUM OF 8 YEARS COMPARED WITH WOMEN IN THE CONTROL GROUP.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
19  884  34 EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON ONE LEG STANDING AND FUNCTIONAL REACH TESTS IN OBESE INDIVIDUALS WITH POOR POSTURAL CONTROL. [PURPOSE] THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON STATIC AND DYNAMIC STANDING BALANCE IN OBESE INDIVIDUALS WITH POOR STANDING BALANCE. [SUBJECTS AND METHODS] SIXTEEN OBESE VOLUNTEERS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED INTO YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS. THE YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM WAS PERFORMED FOR 45 MINUTES PER DAY, 3 TIMES PER WEEK, FOR 4 WEEKS. STATIC AND DYNAMIC BALANCE WERE ASSESSED IN VOLUNTEERS WITH ONE LEG STANDING AND FUNCTIONAL REACH TESTS. OUTCOME MEASURES WERE TESTED BEFORE TRAINING AND AFTER A SINGLE WEEK OF TRAINING. TWO-WAY REPEATED MEASURE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE WITH TUKEY'S HONESTLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE POST HOC STATISTICS WAS USED TO ANALYZE THE DATA. [RESULTS] OBESE INDIVIDUALS SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED STATIC STANDING BALANCE IN THE YOGA TRAINING GROUP, BUT THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OF STATIC OR DYNAMIC STANDING BALANCE IN THE CONTROL GROUP AFTER 4 WEEKS. IN THE YOGA GROUP, SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN STATIC STANDING BALANCE WAS FOUND AFTER THE 2ND, 3RD, AND 4TH WEEKS. COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP, STATIC STANDING BALANCE IN THE YOGA GROUP WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT AFTER THE 2ND WEEK, AND DYNAMIC STANDING BALANCE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT AFTER THE 4TH WEEK. [CONCLUSION] YOGA TRAINING WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR IMPROVING STANDING BALANCE IN OBESE INDIVIDUALS WITH POOR STANDING BALANCE.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
20  969  38 EFFECTS OF AN 8-MONTH YOGA INTERVENTION ON ARTERIAL COMPLIANCE AND MUSCLE STRENGTH IN PREMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE INDICATED THAT YOGA EXERCISE HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON REDUCING BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEART RATE. HOWEVER, NO RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDIES TO DATE HAVE INVESTIGATED ITS EFFECTS ON ARTERIAL COMPLIANCE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF AN 8-MONTH YOGA INTERVENTION ON ARTERIAL COMPLIANCE AND MUSCLE STRENGTH IN NORMAL PREMENOPAUSAL WOMEN 35-50 YEARS OF AGE. THIRTY-FOUR WOMEN WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED EITHER TO A YOGA EXERCISE GROUP (YE, N = 16) OR A CONTROL GROUP (CON, N = 18). PARTICIPANTS IN YE GROUP PERFORMED 60 MINUTES OF AN ASHTANGA YOGA SERIES 2 TIMES/WEEK WITH ONE DAY BETWEEN SESSIONS FOR 8 MONTHS. EACH YOGA SESSION CONSISTED OF 15 MINUTES OF WARM-UP EXERCISES, 35 MINUTES OF ASHTANGA YOGA POSTURES AND 10 MINUTES OF COOL-DOWN WITH RELAXATION; AND THE SESSION INTENSITY WAS PROGRESSIVELY INCREASED DURING THE 8 MONTHS. PARTICIPANTS IN CON WERE ENCOURAGED TO MAINTAIN THEIR NORMAL DAILY LIFESTYLES MONITORED BY THE BONE-SPECIFIC PHYSICAL ACTIVITY QUESTIONNAIRE AT 2 MONTH INTERVALS FOR 8 MONTHS. ARTERIAL COMPLIANCE (PULSE CONTOUR ANALYSIS) AND MUSCLE STRENGTH (1 REPETITION MAXIMUM) WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION. ARTERIAL COMPLIANCE OF THE LARGE AND SMALL ARTERIES WAS NOT AFFECTED BY THE 8 MONTH YOGA TRAINING (P > 0.05). ALSO, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT (P > 0.05) GROUP, TIME, OR GROUP X TIME INTERACTION EFFECTS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR VARIABLES.

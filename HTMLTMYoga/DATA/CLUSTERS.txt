1 2316 205 TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA FOR POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER IN WOMEN VETERANS WHO EXPERIENCED MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA: INTERIM RESULTS FROM A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: TO CONDUCT AN INTERIM ANALYSIS OF DATA COLLECTED FROM AN ONGOING MULTISITE RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL (RCT) ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TRAUMA CENTER TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA (TCTSY) FOR POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) AMONG WOMEN VETERANS WITH PTSD RELATED TO MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA (MST). THE PURPOSE OF THE INTERIM ANALYSIS WAS TO ASSESS OUTCOMES FROM THE PRIMARY SITE, WHICH IS GEOGRAPHICALLY, DEMOGRAPHICALLY, CULTURALLY, AND PROCEDURALLY DISTINCT FROM THE SECOND SITE. DESIGN: RCT WAS CONDUCTED WITHIN A VETERANS ADMINISTRATION HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. DATA COLLECTION INCLUDED PREINTERVENTION THROUGH 3 MONTHS POSTINTERVENTION. PARTICIPANTS: ENROLLMENT FOR THE MAIN SITE WAS 152 WOMEN. THE SAMPLE SIZE FOR THE INTENT-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS WAS 104. THE MAJORITY WERE AFRICAN AMERICAN (91.3%) WITH A MEAN AGE OF 48.46 YEARS. INTERVENTION: THE TCTSY INTERVENTION (N = 58) WAS CONDUCTED BY TCTSY-CERTIFIED YOGA FACILITATORS AND CONSISTED OF 10 WEEKLY 60-MIN GROUP SESSIONS. THE CONTROL INTERVENTION, COGNITIVE PROCESSING THERAPY (CPT; N = 46), CONSISTED OF 12 90-MIN WEEKLY GROUP SESSIONS CONDUCTED PER VETERANS ADMINISTRATION PROTOCOL BY CLINICIANS IN THE PTSD CLINIC. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE CLINICIAN ADMINISTERED PTSD SCALE FOR DSM-5 (CAPS-5) WAS USED TO ASSESS CURRENT PTSD DIAGNOSIS AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY, INCLUDING OVERALL PTSD AND FOUR SYMPTOM CLUSTERS. THE PTSD CHECKLIST FOR DSM-5 (PCL-5) WAS USED TO OBTAIN SELF-REPORT OF PTSD SYMPTOM SEVERITY, INCLUDING TOTAL SCORE AND FOUR SYMPTOM CLUSTERS. RESULTS: THE FINDINGS REPORTED HERE ARE INTERIM RESULTS FROM ONE CLINICAL SITE. FOR BOTH THE CAPS-5 AND PCL-5, TOTAL SCORES AND ALL FOUR CRITERION SCORES DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (P < 0.01) OVER TIME IN ALL FIVE MULTILEVEL LINEAR MODELS WITHIN BOTH TCTSY AND CPT GROUPS, WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS. THERE WERE CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL IMPROVEMENTS SEEN FOR BOTH TCTSY AND CPT WITH 51.1%-64.3% OF TCTSY SUBJECTS AND 43.5%-73.7% OF CPT DECREASING THEIR CAPS-5 SCORES BY 10 POINTS OR MORE. EFFECT SIZES FOR TOTAL SYMPTOM SEVERITY WERE LARGE FOR TCTSY (COHEN'S D = 1.10-1.18) AND CPT (COHEN'S D = 0.90-1.40). INTERVENTION COMPLETION WAS HIGHER IN TCTSY (60.3%) THAN IN CPT (34.8%). SYMPTOM IMPROVEMENT OCCURRED EARLIER FOR TCTSY (MIDINTERVENTION) THAN FOR CPT (2 WEEKS POSTINTERVENTION). SAFETY: THERE WERE NO UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE EVENTS IN THIS STUDY. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATE THAT TCTSY MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR PTSD THAT YIELDS SYMPTOM IMPROVEMENT MORE QUICKLY, HAS HIGHER RETENTION THAN CPT, AND HAS A SUSTAINED EFFECT. TCTSY MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO TRAUMA-FOCUSED THERAPY FOR WOMEN VETERANS WITH PTSD RELATED TO MST. THE STUDY IS REGISTERED IN CLINICALTRIALS.GOV (CTR NO.: NCT02640690).	2021	

2  140  39 A PROSPECTIVE STUDY ON TYPE-2 DIABETIC COMPLICATIONS AND EFFICACY OF INTEGRATED YOGA: A PAN INDIA 2017. BACKGROUND: TYPE 2 DIABETES (T2DM) CONTRIBUTES TO HIGH MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY BECAUSE OF ITS MAJOR COMPLICATIONS RELATED TO KIDNEY, HEART, BRAIN, AND EYES. IT ALSO POSES A HIGH RISK FOR MORTALITY BECAUSE OF COVID-19. STUDIES SUGGEST THE POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS OF YOGA IN DELAYING OR ATTENUATING SUCH COMPLICATIONS. METHODOLOGY: THIS WAS A PAN-INDIA MULTI CENTERED CLUSTER-RANDOMIZED (4 LEVEL) TWO-ARMED TRIAL IN THE RURAL AND URBAN POPULATION OF ALL POPULOUS STATES OF INDIA. DATA WERE OBTAINED USING MOBILE APP IN ALL ADULTS IN THE HOUSEHOLD OF THE SELECTED CLUSTERS. RESULTS: WE REPORT THE DIABETES RELATED COMPLICATIONS IN 16623 ADULTS (48% MALES, 52% FEMALES) FROM 65 DISTRICTS (1 IN 10 DISTRICTS, 2011 CENSUS) OF 29 (OUT OF 35) STATES AND UNION TERRITORIES OF INDIA; MEAN AGE WAS 48.2 +/- 12.46 YEARS. OUT OF THIS 40% LIVED IN RURAL AND 62% IN URBAN LOCATIONS. IN HIGH RISK DIABETES INDIVIDUALS (SCORED >/= 60 POINTS ON INDIAN DIABETES RISK SCORE KEY), 18.0% HAD SELF-REPORTED HISTORY OF (PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY, 6.1% HAD H/O MAJOR STROKES, 5.5% HAD MINOR STROKES (TRANSIENT ISCHEMIC EPISODES), 18.1% HAD LOWER LIMB CLAUDICATION, 20.5% LEG ULCERS, 4.4% HAD H/O CARDIAC SURGERY, 4.8% ANGIOPLASTY, AND 15.1% HAD DIABETES RETINOPATHY. COMPLICATIONS WERE HIGHER IN RURAL THAN IN URBAN AREAS, HIGHER IN PEOPLE WITH EXTENDED DURATION OF DIABETES. INTEGRATED YOGA MODULE FOR THREE MONTHS (ONE HOUR DAILY) SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER REDUCTION IN SYMPTOMS RELATED TO COMPLICATIONS AS COMPARED TO CONTROL GROUP (P < .001). CONCLUSION: THE ALARMING HIGH PREVALENCE OF COMPLICATIONS IN DIABETES POPULATION CALLS FOR URGENT ACTION, WHERE YOGA MAY SHOW THE BENEFITS IN REDUCTION OF SYMPTOMS OF COMPLICATIONS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
3 1803  37 PREVALENCE OF DIABETES AND ITS DETERMINANTS IN THE YOUNG ADULTS INDIAN POPULATION-CALL FOR YOGA INTERVENTION. BACKGROUND: THE YOUNG INDIAN POPULATION, WHICH CONSTITUTES 65% OF THE COUNTRY, IS FAST ADAPTING TO A NEW LIFESTYLE, WHICH WAS NOT KNOWN EARLIER. THEY ARE AT A HIGH RISK OF THE INCREASING BURDEN OF DIABETES AND ASSOCIATED COMPLICATIONS. THE NEW EVOLVING LIFESTYLE IS NOT ONLY AFFECTING PEOPLE'S HEALTH BUT ALSO MOUNTING THE MONETARY BURDEN ON A DEVELOPING COUNTRY SUCH AS INDIA. AIM: WE AIMED TO COLLECT INFORMATION REGARDING THE PREVALENCE OF RISK OF DIABETES IN YOUNG ADULTS (<35 YEARS) IN THE 29 MOST POPULOUS STATES AND UNION TERRITORIES (7 ZONES) OF INDIA, USING A VALIDATED QUESTIONNAIRE. METHODS: A USER-FRIENDLY QUESTIONNAIRE-BASED SURVEY USING A MOBILE APPLICATION WAS CONDUCTED ON ALL ADULTS IN THE 29 MOST POPULOUS STATES/UNION TERRITORIES OF INDIA, AFTER OBTAINING ETHICAL CLEARANCE FOR THE STUDY. HERE, WE REPORT THE ESTIMATION OF THE PREVALENCE OF THE RISK OF DIABETES AND SELF-REPORTED DIABETES ON 58,821 YOUNG INDIVIDUALS BELOW THE AGE OF 35 YEARS. RISK FOR DIABETES WAS ASSESSED USING A STANDARDIZED INSTRUMENT, THE INDIAN DIABETES RISK SCORE (IDRS), THAT HAS 4 FACTORS (AGE, FAMILY HISTORY OF DIABETES, WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE, AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY). SPEARMAN'S CORRELATION COEFFICIENT WAS USED TO CHECK THE CORRELATIONS. RESULTS: THE PREVALENCE OF HIGH (IDRS SCORE > 60), MODERATE (IDRS SCORE 30-50), AND LOW (IDRS < 30) DIABETES RISK IN YOUNG ADULTS (<35 YEARS) WAS 10.2%, 33.1%, AND 56.7%, RESPECTIVELY. THOSE WITH HIGH-RISK SCORES WERE HIGHEST (14.4%) IN THE JAMMU ZONE AND LOWEST (4.1%) IN THE CENTRAL ZONE. THE PREVALENCE OF SELF-REPORTED DIABETES WAS 1.8% WITH A SMALL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEN (1.7%) AND WOMEN (1.9%), AND THE HIGHEST (8.4%) IN THOSE WITH A PARENTAL HISTORY OF DIABETES. THE SOUTH ZONE HAD THE HIGHEST (2.5%), AND THE NORTH WEST ZONE HAD THE LOWEST (4.4%) PREVALENCE. CONCLUSIONS: INDIAN YOUTH ARE AT HIGH RISK FOR DIABETES, WHICH CALLS FOR AN URGENT ACTION PLAN THROUGH INTENSIVE EFFORTS TO PROMOTE LIFESTYLE BEHAVIOR MODIFICATIONS DURING THE PANDEMICS OF BOTH COMMUNICABLE AND NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
4 1613  73 MILITARY-TAILORED YOGA FOR VETERANS WITH POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. INTRODUCTION: AMONG VETERANS OF POST-9/11 CONFLICTS, ESTIMATES OF POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) RANGE FROM 9% SHORTLY AFTER RETURNING FROM DEPLOYMENT TO 31% A YEAR AFTER DEPLOYMENT. CLINICAL AND PHARMACEUTICALLY BASED TREATMENTS ARE UNDERUTILIZED. THIS COULD BE DUE TO CONCERNS RELATED TO LOST DUTY DAYS, AS WELL AS PTSD PATIENTS' FEARS OF STIGMA OF HAVING A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION. YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE PTSD SYMPTOMS IN THE CIVILIAN POPULATION, BUT FEW STUDIES HAVE TESTED THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON VETERANS OF POST-9/11 CONFLICTS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO TEST THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON POST-9/11 VETERANS DIAGNOSED WITH PTSD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE 18 YR OF AGE OR OLDER AND VETERANS OF POST-9/11 CONFLICTS. THEY HAD SUBTHRESHOLD OR DIAGNOSTIC-LEVEL PTSD RELATED TO THEIR COMBAT MILITARY SERVICE, AS DETERMINED BY A SCORE OF 30 OR HIGHER ON THE PTSD CHECKLIST-MILITARY VERSION (PCL-M). VETERANS PARTICIPATED IN 60-MIN WEEKLY YOGA SESSIONS FOR 6 WK TAUGHT BY A WARRIORS AT EASE-TRAINED YOGA INSTRUCTOR WHO IS A, POST-9/11 VETERAN. THE YOGA SESSIONS INCORPORATED VINYASA-STYLE YOGA AND A TRAUMA-SENSITIVE, MILITARY-CULTURE INFORMED APPROACH ADVOCATED BY TWO SEPARATE ORGANIZATIONS: WARRIORS AT EASE AND MEGHAN'S FOUNDATION. DATA WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE AND AGAIN AFTER 7 WK. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS PCL-M SCORE. PARTICIPANTS ALSO COMPLETED THE PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE, THE BECK ANXIETY INVENTORY, THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX, AND THE MINDFUL ATTENTION AWARENESS SCALE AT BOTH TIME POINTS. RESULTS: EIGHTEEN OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM, OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM, AND OPERATION NEW DAWN VETERANS COMPLETED THE PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES. AGE RANGED FROM 26 TO 62 YR (MEDIAN = 43 YR), LENGTH OF SERVICE RANGED FROM 2 TO 34 YR (MEDIAN = 18.8 YR), AND 13 (72.2%) HAD COMPLETED COLLEGE. DECREASED PTSD SYMPTOMATOLOGY WAS DEMONSTRATED IN THE THREE-SYMPTOM CLUSTERS REPRESENTED IN THE PCL-M (I.E., HYPERAROUSAL, RE-EXPERIENCING, AND AVOIDANCE). IN ADDITION, THE TOTAL SCORE ON THE PCL-M DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY, BY BOTH STATISTICAL AND CLINICAL MEASURES. THE PARTICIPANTS ALSO DEMONSTRATED IMPROVED MINDFULNESS SCORES AND REPORTED DECREASED INSOMNIA, DEPRESSION, AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT A TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA INTERVENTION MAY BE EFFECTIVE FOR VETERANS WITH PTSD SYMPTOMS, WHETHER AS STAND-ALONE OR ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY. THE IMPRESSIVE DECREASE IN PTSD SYMPTOMATOLOGY MAY BE DUE TO THE TAILORED MILITARY-SPECIFIC NATURE OF THIS INTERVENTION AND THE FACT THAT IT WAS LED BY A VETERAN OF POST-9/11 CONFLICTS. MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED WITH A LARGER SAMPLE AND A MORE DIVERSE VETERAN POPULATION.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                               
5 2370  51 WHAT BRINGS YOUNG ADULTS TO THE YOGA MAT? CROSS-SECTIONAL ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AND PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH AMONG PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROJECT EAT-IV SURVEY. OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY EXAMINES MOTIVATIONS FOR YOGA AND IDENTIFIES UNIQUE MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AMONG A SAMPLE OF YOUNG ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS. THIS STUDY FURTHER DETERMINES HOW YOUNG ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS' MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES ASSOCIATE WITH PHYSICAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS. SUBJECTS/SETTING: SURVEY DATA WERE DRAWN FROM THE FOURTH WAVE OF A LARGE, POPULATION-BASED STUDY (PROJECT EAT-IV; EATING AND ACTIVITY IN TEENS AND YOUNG ADULTS). DESIGN: LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS (LCA) WAS USED TO IDENTIFY MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AMONG PROJECT EAT-IV PARTICIPANTS PRACTICING YOGA (N = 297; MEAN AGE: 30.8-1.7 YEARS; 79.7 % FEMALE). CROSS-SECTIONAL ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN LATENT MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES, PHYSICAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS WERE DETERMINED WITH UNADJUSTED AND ADJUSTED (GENDER, RACE/ETHNICITY, AND BODY MASS INDEX) GENERAL LINEAR MODELS. RESULTS: ACROSS MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES, MOST YOUNG ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS WERE MOTIVATED BY ENHANCED FITNESS AND STRESS REDUCTION/RELAXATION. ADDITIONAL MOTIVATIONS FOR YOGA CLUSTERED BY APPEARANCE (DESIRE TO CHANGE BODY APPEARANCE OR WEIGHT) OR MINDFULNESS (DESIRE TO INCREASE PRESENT MOMENT AWARENESS) UNDERPINNINGS. THE LCA CHARACTERIZED MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AS "LOW APPEARANCE, LOW MINDFULNESS" (CLASS 1; N = 77), "LOW APPEARANCE, HIGH MINDFULNESS" (CLASS 2; N = 48), "HIGH APPEARANCE, LOW MINDFULNESS" (CLASS 3; N = 79), AND "HIGH APPEARANCE, HIGH MINDFULNESS" (CLASS 4; N = 93). HAVING A PROFILE WITH HIGH MINDFULNESS AND LOW APPEARANCE MOTIVATIONS (CLASS 2) WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER BODY SATISFACTION IN COMPARISON TO THE OTHER CLASSES (P < 0.001). RELATIVE TO CLASS 2, THOSE WITH LOW MINDFULNESS MOTIVATIONS (CLASS 1; CLASS 3) REPORTED LESS TOTAL PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (P = 0.002) AND THOSE WITH HIGH APPEARANCE MOTIVATIONS (CLASS 3; CLASS 4) REPORTED HIGHER COMPULSIVE EXERCISE SCORES (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: IN THIS SAMPLE, HIGH MINDFULNESS AND LOW APPEARANCE MOTIVATIONS FOR YOGA APPEARED OPTIMAL FOR PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH. CROSS-SECTIONAL FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOUNG ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS' MIND-BODY HEALTH MAY BE SUPPORTED BY MOTIVATIONAL UNDERPINNINGS THAT EMPHASIZE YOGA'S INTERNAL (MINDFULNESS) RATHER THAN EXTERNAL (APPEARANCE) BENEFITS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
6 2048  31 THE AFRICA YOGA PROJECT: A PARTICIPANT-DRIVEN CONCEPT MAP OF KENYAN TEACHERS' REPORTED EXPERIENCES. OBJECTIVE: THE AFRICA YOGA PROJECT (AYP) TRAINS AND FUNDS KENYANS TO TEACH COMMUNITY YOGA CLASSES. PRELIMINARY RESEARCH WITH A SMALL SAMPLE OF AYP TEACHERS SUGGESTED THE PROGRAM HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT. THIS STUDY USED CONCEPT MAPPING TO EXPLORE THE EXPERIENCES OF A LARGER SAMPLE. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS BRAINSTORMED STATEMENTS ABOUT HOW PRACTICING AND/OR TEACHING YOGA CHANGED THEM. THEY SORTED STATEMENTS INTO SELF-DEFINED PILES AND RATED THEM IN TERMS OF PERCEIVED IMPORTANCE. MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING (MDS) OF SORT DATA CALCULATED STATEMENT COORDINATES WHEREIN EACH STATEMENT IS PLACED IN PROXIMITY TO OTHER STATEMENTS AS A FUNCTION OF HOW FREQUENTLY STATEMENTS ARE SORTED TOGETHER BY PARTICIPANTS. THESE RESULTS ARE THEN AND MAPPED IN A TWO-DIMENSIONAL SPACE. HIERARCHICAL CLUSTER ANALYSIS (HCA) OF THESE DATA IDENTIFIED CLUSTERS (I.E., CONCEPTS) AMONG STATEMENTS. CLUSTER AVERAGE IMPORTANCE RATINGS GAVE THE CONCEPT MAP DEPTH AND INDICATED CONCEPT IMPORTANCE. BRIDGING ANALYSIS AND RESEARCHERS' CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF YOGA LITERATURE FACILITATED HCA INTERPRETIVE DECISIONS. RESULTS: OF 72 AYP TEACHERS, 52 AND 48 TEACHERS PARTICIPATED IN BRAINSTORMING AND SORTING/RATING ACTIVITIES, RESPECTIVELY. TEACHERS BRAINSTORMED 93 STATEMENTS ABOUT HOW THEY HAD CHANGED. THE RESULTANT MDS STATEMENT MAP HAD ADEQUATE VALIDITY (STRESS VALUE = .29). HCA CREATED A 12-CLUSTER SOLUTION WITH THE FOLLOWING CONCEPTS OF PERCEIVED CHANGE: IDENTITY AS A YOGA TEACHER; PROSOCIAL DEVELOPMENT; EXISTENTIAL POSSIBILITY; GENUINE POSITIVE REGARD; VALUE AND RESPECT FOR OTHERS (HIGHEST IMPORTANCE); PRESENCE, ACCEPTANCE, AND COMPETENCE; SERVICE AND TRUST; NON-JUDGMENT AND EMOTION REGULATION (LOWEST IMPORTANCE); ENGAGEMENT AND CONNECTION; INTERPERSONAL EFFECTIVENESS; PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING; AND PHYSICAL COMPETENCE AND SECURITY. CONCLUSIONS: TEACHERS PERCEIVED THE AYP AS FACILITATING CHANGE ACROSS PHYSICAL, MENTAL, AND SPIRITUAL DOMAINS. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO QUANTIFY AND COMPARE THIS CHANGE TO OTHER HEALTH PROMOTION PROGRAM OUTCOMES.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
7  390  57 BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL-BEING IN A US HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM: A PRELIMINARY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: TO TEST FEASIBILITY OF YOGA WITHIN A HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM AND EVALUATE PREVENTIVE EFFICACY FOR PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL-BEING. METHODS: GRADE 11 OR 12 STUDENTS (N = 51) WHO REGISTERED FOR PHYSICAL EDUCATION (PE) WERE CLUSTER-RANDOMIZED BY CLASS 2:1 YOGA:PE-AS-USUAL. A KRIPALU-BASED YOGA PROGRAM OF PHYSICAL POSTURES, BREATHING EXERCISES, RELAXATION, AND MEDITATION WAS TAUGHT 2 TO 3 TIMES A WEEK FOR 10 WEEKS. SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES WERE ADMINISTERED TO STUDENTS 1 WEEK BEFORE AND AFTER. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES OF PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL-BEING WERE PROFILE OF MOOD STATES-SHORT FORM AND POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECT SCHEDULE FOR CHILDREN. ADDITIONAL MEASURES OF PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL-BEING INCLUDED PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE AND INVENTORY OF POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL ATTITUDES. SECONDARY MEASURES OF SELF-REGULATORY SKILLS INCLUDED RESILIENCE SCALE, STATE TRAIT ANGER EXPRESSION INVENTORY-2, AND CHILD ACCEPTANCE MINDFULNESS MEASURE. TO ASSESS FEASIBILITY, YOGA STUDENTS COMPLETED A PROGRAM EVALUATION. ANALYSES OF COVARIANCE WERE CONDUCTED BETWEEN GROUPS WITH BASELINE AS THE COVARIATE. RESULTS: ALTHOUGH PE-AS-USUAL STUDENTS SHOWED DECREASES IN PRIMARY OUTCOMES, YOGA STUDENTS MAINTAINED OR IMPROVED. TOTAL MOOD DISTURBANCE IMPROVED IN YOGA STUDENTS AND WORSENED IN CONTROLS (P = .015), AS DID PROFILE OF MOOD STATES-SHORT FORM (POMS-SF) TENSION-ANXIETY SUBSCALE (P = .002). ALTHOUGH POSITIVE AFFECT REMAINED UNCHANGED IN BOTH, NEGATIVE AFFECT SIGNIFICANTLY WORSENED IN CONTROLS WHILE IMPROVING IN YOGA STUDENTS (P = .006). SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT. STUDENTS RATED YOGA FAIRLY HIGH, DESPITE MODERATE ATTENDANCE. CONCLUSIONS: IMPLEMENTATION WAS FEASIBLE AND STUDENTS GENERALLY FOUND IT BENEFICIAL. ALTHOUGH NOT CAUSAL DUE TO SMALL, UNEVEN SAMPLE SIZE, THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY SUGGESTS PREVENTIVE BENEFITS IN PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL-BEING FROM KRIPALU YOGA DURING HIGH SCHOOL PE. THESE RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED STUDIES OF YOGA IN SCHOOL SETTINGS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
8  625  44 DIABETIC YOGA PROTOCOL IMPROVES GLYCEMIC, ANTHROPOMETRIC AND LIPID LEVELS IN HIGH RISK INDIVIDUALS FOR DIABETES: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL FROM NORTHERN INDIA. PURPOSE: TO STUDY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DIABETIC YOGA PROTOCOL (DYP) AGAINST MANAGEMENT OF CARDIOVASCULAR RISK PROFILE IN A HIGH-RISK COMMUNITY FOR DIABETES, FROM CHANDIGARH, INDIA. METHODS: THE STUDY WAS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, CONDUCTED AS A SUB STUDY OF THE PAN INDIA TRIAL NIYANTRITA MADHUMEHA BHARATH (NMB). THE COHORT WAS IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE INDIAN DIABETES RISK SCORING (IDRS) (>/= 60) AND A TOTAL OF 184 INDIVIDUALS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO INTERVENTION (N = 91) AND CONTROL GROUPS (N = 93). THE DYP GROUP UNDERWENT THE SPECIFIC DYP TRAINING WHEREAS THE CONTROL GROUP FOLLOWED THEIR DAILY REGIMEN. THE STUDY OUTCOMES INCLUDED CHANGES IN GLYCEMIC AND LIPID PROFILE. ANALYSIS WAS DONE UNDER INTENT-TO-TREAT PRINCIPLE. RESULTS: THE 3 MONTHS DYP PRACTICE SHOWED DIVERSE RESULTS SHOWING GLYCEMIC AND LIPID PROFILE OF THE HIGH RISK INDIVIDUALS. THREE MONTHS OF DYP INTERVENTION WAS FOUND TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE LEVELS OF POST-PRANDIAL GLUCOSE LEVELS (P = 0.035) AND LDL-C LEVELS (P = 0.014) AND WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: THE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE DYP INTERVENTION COULD IMPROVE THE METABOLIC STATUS OF THE HIGH-DIABETES-RISK INDIVIDUALS WITH RESPECT TO THEIR GLUCOSE TOLERANCE AND LIPID LEVELS, PARTIALLY EXPLAINED BY THE REDUCTION IN ABDOMINAL OBESITY.

9  938  41 EFFECTS OF 1-YEAR YOGA ON CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS IN MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER ADULTS WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME: A RANDOMIZED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: METABOLIC SYNDROME (METS) IS A CLUSTERING OF CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS, WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH DIABETES MELLITUS AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS APPLIED TO PEOPLE WITH METS HAS CONSIDERABLE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON DISEASE PREVENTIVE OUTCOMES. THIS STUDY AIMED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF 1-YEAR OF YOGA EXERCISE ON THE CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS INCLUDING CENTRAL OBESITY, HYPERTENSION, DYSLIPIDEMIA AND HYPERGLYCEMIA IN MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER HONG KONG CHINESE ADULTS WITH METS. METHODS: ADULTS DIAGNOSED WITH METS USING NATIONAL CHOLESTEROL EDUCATION PROGRAM CRITERIA (N = 182; MEAN +/- SD AGE = 56 +/- 9.1) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A 1-YEAR YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP OR CONTROL GROUP. SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE, WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE, FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE, TRIGLYCERIDES, AND HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL WERE EXAMINED AT BASELINE, MIDWAY, AND ON COMPLETION OF THE STUDY. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY LEVEL AND CALORIC INTAKE WERE ASSESSED AND INCLUDED IN THE COVARIATE ANALYSES. RESULTS: A REDUCTION OF THE NUMBER OF DIAGNOSTIC COMPONENTS FOR METS WAS FOUND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE YOGA INTERVENTION. WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED AFTER THE 1-YEAR YOGA INTERVENTION. A TREND TOWARDS A DECREASE IN SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE WAS OBSERVED FOLLOWING YOGA INTERVENTION. CONCLUSION: THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA EXERCISE IMPROVES THE CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS INCLUDING CENTRAL OBESITY AND BLOOD PRESSURE IN MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER ADULTS WITH METS. THESE FINDINGS SUPPORT THE COMPLEMENTARY BENEFICIAL ROLE OF YOGA IN MANAGING METS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
10 1787  45 PREFERENCE AND EXPECTATION FOR TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF ONCE- VS TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. BACKGROUND: IN STUDIES INVOLVING NONPHARMACOLOGICAL COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE INTERVENTIONS, PARTICIPANT BLINDING IS VERY DIFFICULT. PARTICIPANT EXPECTATIONS MAY AFFECT PERCEIVED BENEFIT OF THERAPY. IN STUDIES OF YOGA AS TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PATIENT EXPECTATIONS AND PREFERENCES ON OUTCOMES. THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY BASELINE PREDICTORS OF PREFERENCE AND TO DETERMINE IF EXPECTATIONS AND PREFERENCES FOR DIFFERENT DOSES OF YOGA AFFECT BACK-RELATED FUNCTION AND LOW BACK PAIN INTENSITY. METHODS: THIS WAS A SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS OF A 12-WEEK RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING ONCE-WEEKLY VS TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA FOR TREATMENT OF CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN IN 93 ADULTS FROM A PREDOMINANTLY LOW-INCOME MINORITY POPULATION. AT BASELINE, PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED ABOUT BACK FUNCTION, BACK PAIN, TREATMENT EXPECTATIONS, AND TREATMENT PREFERENCES. WE CREATED A VARIABLE "CONCORDANCE" TO DESCRIBE THE MATCHING OF PARTICIPANT PREFERENCE TO RANDOMIZED TREATMENT. OUR OUTCOME VARIABLES WERE CHANGE IN BACK FUNCTION AND PAIN INTENSITY AFTER 12 WEEKS OF YOGA INSTRUCTION. WE PERFORMED LOGISTIC REGRESSION TO IDENTIFY PREDICTORS OF PREFERENCE FOR ONCE- OR TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA INSTRUCTION. WE CREATED LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS TO IDENTIFY INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN EXPECTATIONS, PREFERENCE, CONCORDANCE, AND OUTCOMES. RESULTS: WORSE BACK FUNCTION AT BASELINE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH 20% HIGHER ODDS OF PREFERRING TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA (OR 1.2, CI 1.1, 1.3). INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGHER EXPECTATION SCORES FOR TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA HAD 90% HIGHER ODDS OF PREFERRING TWICE-WEEKLY VS ONCE-WEEKLY YOGA (OR 1.9, CI 1.3, 2.7). INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGHER EXPECTATION SCORES FOR ONCE-WEEKLY YOGA HAD 40% LESS ODDS OF PREFERRING TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA (OR 0.6, CI 0.5, 0.9). AFTER CONTROLLING FOR BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS, WE FOUND NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TREATMENT OUTCOMES, PREFERENCE, EXPECTATION SCORES, OR CONCORDANCE. CONCLUSION: IN A POPULATION OF PREDOMINANTLY LOW-INCOME MINORITY PARTICIPANTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN, WORSE BACK FUNCTION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH PREFERENCE FOR MORE FREQUENT YOGA CLASSES. THOSE WHO PREFERRED MORE YOGA CLASSES HAD HIGHER EXPECTATIONS FOR THOSE CLASSES. TWELVE-WEEK CHANGE IN BACK PAIN INTENSITY AND BACK FUNCTION WERE NOT AFFECTED BY DOSING PREFERENCE, EXPECTATION SCORE, OR CONCORDANCE. MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO BETTER MEASURE AND QUANTIFY PREFERENCE, EXPECTATIONS, AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO OUTCOMES IN YOGA RESEARCH.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
11 2763  43 YOGA PROGRAM FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES PREVENTION (YOGA-DP) AMONG HIGH-RISK PEOPLE: QUALITATIVE STUDY TO EXPLORE REASONS FOR NON-PARTICIPATION IN A FEASIBILITY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IN INDIA. BACKGROUND: YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM). WE DEVELOPED A YOGA PROGRAM FOR T2DM PREVENTION (YOGA-DP) AMONG HIGH-RISK PEOPLE AND CONDUCTED A FEASIBILITY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) IN INDIA. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO IDENTIFY AND EXPLORE WHY POTENTIAL PARTICIPANTS DECLINED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FEASIBILITY RCT. METHODS: AN EXPLORATORY QUALITATIVE STUDY, USING SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS, WAS CONDUCTED AT A YOGA CENTER IN NEW DELHI, INDIA. FOURTEEN PEOPLE (10 WOMEN AND FOUR MEN) WHO DECLINED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FEASIBILITY RCT WERE INTERVIEWED, AND 13 OF THEM COMPLETED THE NON-PARTICIPANT QUESTIONNAIRE, WHICH CAPTURED THEIR SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHICS, DIETS, PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES, AND REASONS FOR DECLINING. RESULTS: THREE TYPES OF BARRIERS WERE IDENTIFIED AND EXPLORED WHICH PREVENTED PARTICIPATION IN THE FEASIBILITY RCT: (1) PERSONAL BARRIERS, SUCH AS LACK OF TIME, PERCEIVED SUFFICIENCY OF KNOWLEDGE, PREFERENCES ABOUT SELF-MANAGEMENT OF HEALTH, AND TRUST IN OTHER TRADITIONAL AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES; (2) CONTEXTUAL BARRIERS, SUCH AS SOCIAL INFLUENCES AND LACK OF AWARENESS ABOUT PREVENTIVE CARE; AND (3) STUDY-RELATED BARRIERS, SUCH AS LACK OF STUDY INFORMATION, POOR ACCESSIBILITY TO THE YOGA SITE, AND LACK OF TRUST IN THE STUDY METHODS AND INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: WE IDENTIFIED AND EXPLORED PERSONAL, CONTEXTUAL, AND STUDY-RELATED BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATION IN A FEASIBILITY RCT IN INDIA. THE FINDINGS WILL HELP TO ADDRESS RECRUITMENT CHALLENGES IN FUTURE YOGA AND OTHER RCTS.

12  217  55 A STUDY PROTOCOL OF A THREE-GROUP RANDOMIZED FEASIBILITY TRIAL OF AN ONLINE YOGA INTERVENTION FOR MOTHERS AFTER STILLBIRTH (THE MINDFUL HEALTH STUDY). BACKGROUND: IN THE USA, STILLBIRTH (IN UTERO FETAL DEATH >/=20 WEEKS GESTATION) IS A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE. WOMEN WHO EXPERIENCE STILLBIRTH, COMPARED TO WOMEN WITH LIVE BIRTH, HAVE A NEARLY SEVENFOLD INCREASED RISK OF A POSITIVE SCREEN FOR POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) AND A FOURFOLD INCREASED RISK OF DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF WOMEN WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THE DEATH OF THEIR BABY BECOME PREGNANT WITHIN 12-18 MONTHS AND THE LACK OF INTERVENTION STUDIES CONDUCTED WITHIN THIS POPULATION, NOVEL APPROACHES TARGETING PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH, SPECIFIC TO THE NEEDS OF THIS POPULATION, ARE CRITICAL. EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT YOGA IS EFFICACIOUS, SAFE, ACCEPTABLE, AND COST-EFFECTIVE FOR IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH IN A VARIETY OF POPULATIONS, INCLUDING PREGNANT AND POSTPARTUM WOMEN. TO DATE, THERE ARE NO KNOWN STUDIES EXAMINING ONLINE-STREAMING YOGA AS A STRATEGY TO HELP MOTHERS COPE WITH PTSD SYMPTOMS AFTER STILLBIRTH. METHODS: THE PRESENT STUDY IS A TWO-PHASE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. PHASE 1 WILL INVOLVE (1) AN ITERATIVE DESIGN PROCESS TO DEVELOP THE ONLINE YOGA PRESCRIPTION FOR PHASE 2 AND (2) QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS TO IDENTIFY CULTURAL BARRIERS TO RECRUITMENT IN NON-CAUCASIAN WOMEN (I.E., PREDOMINATELY HISPANIC AND/OR AFRICAN AMERICAN) WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED STILLBIRTH (N = 5). PHASE 2 IS A THREE-GROUP RANDOMIZED FEASIBILITY TRIAL WITH ASSESSMENTS AT BASELINE, AND AT 12 AND 20 WEEKS POST-INTERVENTION. NINETY WOMEN WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED A STILLBIRTH WITHIN 6 WEEKS TO 24 MONTHS WILL BE RANDOMIZED INTO ONE OF THE FOLLOWING THREE ARMS FOR 12 WEEKS: (1) INTERVENTION LOW DOSE (LD) = 60 MIN/WEEK ONLINE-STREAMING YOGA (N = 30), (2) INTERVENTION MODERATE DOSE (MD) = 150 MIN/WEEK ONLINE-STREAMING YOGA (N = 30), OR (3) STRETCH AND TONE CONTROL (STC) GROUP = 60 MIN/WEEK OF STRETCHING/TONING EXERCISES (N = 30). DISCUSSION: THIS STUDY WILL EXPLORE THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF A 12-WEEK, HOME-BASED, ONLINE-STREAMED YOGA INTERVENTION, WITH VARYING DOSES AMONG MOTHERS AFTER A STILLBIRTH. IF FEASIBLE, THE FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY WILL INFORM A FULL-SCALE TRIAL TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HOME-BASED ONLINE-STREAMED YOGA TO IMPROVE PTSD. LONG-TERM, HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS COULD USE ONLINE YOGA AS A NON-PHARMACEUTICAL, INEXPENSIVE RESOURCE FOR STILLBIRTH AFTERCARE.

13  258  51 ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF A 12-WEEK YOGA VS. EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS): STUDY PROTOCOL FOR A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS) IS A COMMON AND BURDENSOME SLEEP DISORDER ASSOCIATED WITH PROFOUND IMPAIRMENT OF HEALTH, WELL-BEING, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. UNFORTUNATELY, THE MEDICATIONS USED FOR RLS MANAGEMENT CARRY RISK OF SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS, INCLUDING AUGMENTATION OF SYMPTOMS. YOGA, AN ANCIENT MIND-BODY DISCIPLINE DESIGNED TO PROMOTE PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, AND MENTAL WELL-BEING, MAY OFFER A VIABLE, LOW-RISK NEW TREATMENT. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF THIS PILOT, PARALLEL-ARM, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) ARE TO ASSESS THE ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF A 12-WEEK YOGA VS. EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RLS. METHODS: FORTY-FOUR ADULTS WITH CONFIRMED MODERATE TO SEVERE RLS WILL BE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED TO A 12-WEEK YOGA (N = 22) OR STANDARDIZED EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM (N = 22). YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS WILL ATTEND TWO 75-MIN IYENGAR YOGA CLASSES PER WEEK FOR THE FIRST 4 WEEKS, THEN ONE 75-MIN CLASS PER WEEK FOR THE REMAINING 8 WEEKS, AND WILL COMPLETE A 30-MIN HOMEWORK ROUTINE ON NON-CLASS DAYS. EDUCATIONAL FILM GROUP PARTICIPANTS WILL ATTEND ONE 75-MIN CLASS PER WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS AND COMPLETE A DAILY RLS TREATMENT LOG; CLASSES WILL INCLUDE INFORMATION ON: RLS MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING SLEEP HYGIENE PRACTICES; OTHER SLEEP DISORDERS; AND COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES LIKELY TO BE OF INTEREST TO THOSE PARTICIPATING IN A YOGA AND SLEEP EDUCATION STUDY. YOGA AND TREATMENT LOGS WILL BE COLLECTED WEEKLY. FEASIBILITY OUTCOMES WILL INCLUDE RECRUITMENT, ENROLLMENT, AND RANDOMIZATION RATES, RETENTION, ADHERENCE, AND PROGRAM SATISFACTION. PROGRAM EVALUATION AND YOGA-DOSING QUESTIONNAIRES WILL BE COLLECTED AT WEEK 12; DATA ON EXPLORATORY OUTCOMES (E.G., RLS SYMPTOM SEVERITY (IRLS), SLEEP QUALITY (PSQI), MOOD (POMS, PSS), AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (SF-36)) WILL BE GATHERED AT BASELINE AND WEEK 12. DISCUSSION: THIS STUDY WILL LAY THE ESSENTIAL GROUNDWORK FOR A PLANNED LARGER RCT TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF A YOGA PROGRAM FOR REDUCING SYMPTOMS AND ASSOCIATED BURDEN OF RLS. IF THE FINDINGS OF THE CURRENT TRIAL AND THE SUBSEQUENT LARGER RCTS ARE POSITIVE, THIS STUDY WILL ALSO HELP SUPPORT A NEW APPROACH TO CLINICAL TREATMENT OF THIS CHALLENGING DISORDER, HELP FOSTER IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF RLS ETIOLOGY, AND ULTIMATELY CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCING THE INDIVIDUAL, SOCIETAL, AND ECONOMIC BURDEN ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CONDITION.

14 2047  30 THE AFRICA YOGA PROJECT AND WELL-BEING: A CONCEPT MAP OF STUDENTS' PERCEPTIONS. BACKGROUND: CONCEPT MAPPING METHODOLOGY WAS USED TO EXPLORE THE PERCEIVED IMPACT OF PRACTICING YOGA WITH THE AFRICA YOGA PROJECT (AYP)-AN ORGANISATION CREATED TO INCREASE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING BY PROVIDING COMMUNITY-BASED YOGA CLASSES THROUGHOUT KENYA. AYP'S MISSION FIT WITH THEORETICAL MODELS OF WELL-BEING IS DISCUSSED. ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE AND INITIAL QUALITATIVE RESEARCH SUGGESTED THE AYP MEANINGFULLY IMPACTED ADULT STUDENTS. METHODS: OF THE HUNDREDS OF AYP'S ADULT STUDENTS, 56 AND 82 STUDENTS PARTICIPATED IN PHASES I AND II, RESPECTIVELY. PHASE I BRAINSTORMING RESULTED IN 94 STUDENT-GENERATED STATEMENTS ABOUT THEIR PERCEIVED CHANGE. PHASE II PARTICIPANTS SORTED AND RATED STATEMENTS IN TERMS OF IMPORTANCE. MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING AND HIERARCHICAL CLUSTER ANALYSIS OF SORT DATA WAS UTILISED TO MAP AND GROUP STATEMENTS INTO CLUSTERS. RESULTS: BASED ON STATISTICAL AND INTERPRETIVE CRITERIA, A FIVE-CLUSTER SOLUTION WITH THE FOLLOWING CONCEPTS WAS IDENTIFIED AS THE BEST MODEL OF STUDENTS' CHANGE: PERSONAL GROWTH; INTERPERSONAL EFFECTIVENESS (LOWEST IMPORTANCE); PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL BENEFITS; EMOTIONAL RESILIENCY; AND IMPROVED SELF-CONCEPT (HIGHEST IMPORTANCE). CONCLUSIONS: OVERALL, STUDENTS REPORTED POSITIVE PERCEPTIONS OF THE AYP. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO QUANTIFY STUDENTS' CHANGE, AND TO COMPARE THE AYP OUTCOMES TO THOSE OF OTHER PROGRAMS AIMED AT POVERTY-RELATED STRESS REDUCTION AND WELL-BEING.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
15 1541  53 KRIPALU YOGA FOR MILITARY VETERANS WITH PTSD: A RANDOMIZED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA FOR MILITARY VETERANS AND ACTIVE DUTY PERSONNEL WITH POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) EVALUATED THE EFFICACY OF A 10-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION ON PTSD. METHOD: FIFTY-ONE PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO YOGA OR NO-TREATMENT ASSESSMENT-ONLY CONTROL GROUPS. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED QUESTIONNAIRES AND THE CLINICIAN ADMINISTERED PTSD SCALE. RESULTS: BOTH YOGA (N = 9) AND CONTROL (N = 6) PARTICIPANTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN REEXPERIENCING SYMPTOMS, WITH NO SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCES. SECONDARY WITHIN-GROUP ANALYSES OF A SELF-SELECTED WAIT-LIST YOGA GROUP (N = 7) SHOWED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN PTSD SYMPTOMS AFTER YOGA PARTICIPATION, IN CONTRAST TO THEIR CONTROL GROUP PARTICIPATION. CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT LITERATURE REGARDING HIGH RATES OF PTSD TREATMENT DROPOUT FOR VETERANS, THIS STUDY FACED CHALLENGES RETAINING PARTICIPANTS ACROSS CONDITIONS. CONCLUSION: THESE RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH RECENT LITERATURE INDICATING THAT YOGA MAY HAVE POTENTIAL AS A PTSD THERAPY IN A VETERAN OR MILITARY POPULATION. HOWEVER, ADDITIONAL LARGER SAMPLE SIZE TRIALS ARE NECESSARY TO CONFIRM THIS CONCLUSION.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
16  518  47 COMPARING ONCE- VERSUS TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN IN PREDOMINANTLY LOW INCOME MINORITIES: A RANDOMIZED DOSING TRIAL. BACKGROUND. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT ONCE-WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES ARE EFFECTIVE FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) IN WHITE ADULTS WITH HIGH SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. THE COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF TWICE-WEEKLY CLASSES AND GENERALIZABILITY TO RACIALLY DIVERSE LOW INCOME POPULATIONS ARE UNKNOWN. METHODS. WE CONDUCTED A 12-WEEK RANDOMIZED, PARALLEL-GROUP, DOSING TRIAL FOR 95 ADULTS RECRUITED FROM AN URBAN SAFETY-NET HOSPITAL AND FIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS COMPARING ONCE-WEEKLY (N = 49) VERSUS TWICE-WEEKLY (N = 46) STANDARDIZED YOGA CLASSES SUPPLEMENTED BY HOME PRACTICE. PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE CHANGE FROM BASELINE TO 12 WEEKS IN PAIN (11-POINT SCALE) AND BACK-RELATED FUNCTION (23-POINT MODIFIED ROLAND-MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE). RESULTS. 82% OF PARTICIPANTS WERE NONWHITE; 77% HAD ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD INCOMES <$40,000. THE SAMPLE'S BASELINE MEAN PAIN INTENSITY [6.9 (SD 1.6)] AND FUNCTION [13.7 (SD 5.0)] REFLECTED MODERATE TO SEVERE BACK PAIN AND IMPAIRMENT. PAIN AND BACK-RELATED FUNCTION IMPROVED WITHIN BOTH GROUPS (P < 0.001). HOWEVER, THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ONCE-WEEKLY AND TWICE-WEEKLY GROUPS FOR PAIN REDUCTION [-2.1 (95% CI -2.9, -1.3) VERSUS -2.4 (95% CI -3.1, -1.8), P = 0.62] OR BACK-RELATED FUNCTION [-5.1 (95% CI -7.0, -3.2) VERSUS -4.9 (95% CI -6.5, -3.3), P = 0.83]. CONCLUSIONS. TWELVE WEEKS OF ONCE-WEEKLY OR TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES WERE SIMILARLY EFFECTIVE FOR PREDOMINANTLY LOW INCOME MINORITY ADULTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. THIS TRIAL IS REGISTERED WITH CLINICALTRIALS.GOV NCT01761617.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
17 1699  53 PARTICIPANT CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH SYMPTOMATIC IMPROVEMENT FROM YOGA FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. CONTEXT: STUDIES SUGGEST THAT YOGA IS EFFECTIVE FOR MODERATE TO SEVERE CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) IN DIVERSE PREDOMINANTLY LOWER SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS POPULATIONS. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH BENEFIT FROM THE YOGA INTERVENTION. OBJECTIVE: IDENTIFY FACTORS AT BASELINE INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER EFFICACY AMONG PARTICIPANTS IN A STUDY OF YOGA FOR CLBP. DESIGN: FROM SEPTEMBER-DECEMBER 2011, A 12-WEEK RANDOMIZED DOSING TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED COMPARING WEEKLY VS. TWICE-WEEKLY 75-MINUTE HATHA YOGA CLASSES FOR 95 PREDOMINANTLY LOW-INCOME MINORITY ADULTS WITH NONSPECIFIC CLBP. PARTICIPANT CHARACTERISTICS COLLECTED AT BASELINE WERE USED TO DETERMINE FACTORS BEYOND TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT (REPORTED IN THE INITIAL STUDY) THAT PREDICTED OUTCOME. WE USED BIVARIATE TESTING TO IDENTIFY BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENT IN FUNCTION AND PAIN, AND INCLUDED SELECT FACTORS IN A MULTIVARIATE LINEAR REGRESSION. SETTING: RECRUITMENT AND CLASSES OCCURRED IN AN ACADEMIC SAFETY-NET HOSPITAL AND FIVE AFFILIATED COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS IN BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS. PARTICIPANTS: NINETY-FIVE ADULTS WITH NONSPECIFIC CLBP, AGES RANGING FROM 20-64 (MEAN 48) YEARS; 72 WOMEN AND 23 MEN. OUTCOME MEASURES: PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE CHANGES IN BACK-RELATED FUNCTION (MODIFIED ROLAND-MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE, RMDQ; 0-23) AND MEAN LOW BACK PAIN INTENSITY (0-10) IN THE PREVIOUS WEEK, FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 12. RESULTS: ADJUSTING FOR GROUP ASSIGNMENT, BASELINE RMDQ, AGE, AND GENDER, FOREIGN NATIONALITY AND LOWER BASELINE SF36 PHYSICAL COMPONENT SCORE (PCS) WERE INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENT IN RMDQ. GREATER THAN HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION LEVEL, CLBP LESS THAN 1 YEAR, AND LOWER BASELINE SF36 PCS WERE INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENT IN PAIN INTENSITY. OTHER DEMOGRAPHICS INCLUDING RACE, INCOME, GENDER, BMI, AND USE OF PAIN MEDICATIONS WERE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH EITHER OUTCOME. CONCLUSIONS: POOR PHYSICAL HEALTH AT BASELINE IS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER IMPROVEMENT FROM YOGA IN BACK-RELATED FUNCTION AND PAIN. RACE, INCOME, AND BODY MASS INDEX DO NOT AFFECT THE POTENTIAL FOR A PERSON WITH LOW BACK PAIN TO EXPERIENCE BENEFIT FROM YOGA.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
18 2596  63 YOGA FOR MILITARY VETERANS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) IS PREVALENT, ESPECIALLY AMONG MILITARY VETERANS. MANY CLBP TREATMENT OPTIONS HAVE LIMITED BENEFITS AND ARE ACCOMPANIED BY SIDE EFFECTS. MAJOR EFFORTS TO REDUCE OPIOID USE AND EMBRACE NONPHARMACOLOGICAL PAIN TREATMENTS HAVE RESULTED. RESEARCH WITH COMMUNITY CLBP PATIENTS INDICATES THAT YOGA CAN IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND HAS FEW SIDE EFFECTS. THE BENEFITS OF YOGA AMONG MILITARY VETERANS WERE EXAMINED. DESIGN: PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER YOGA OR DELAYED YOGA TREATMENT IN 2013-2015. OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE, 6 WEEKS, 12 WEEKS, AND 6 MONTHS. INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSES OCCURRED IN 2016. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILITARY VETERANS WITH CLBP WERE RECRUITED FROM A MAJOR VETERANS AFFAIRS MEDICAL CENTER IN CALIFORNIA. INTERVENTION: YOGA CLASSES (WITH HOME PRACTICE) WERE LED BY A CERTIFIED INSTRUCTOR TWICE WEEKLY FOR 12 WEEKS, AND CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF PHYSICAL POSTURES, MOVEMENT, AND BREATHING TECHNIQUES. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS ROLAND-MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE SCORES AFTER 12 WEEKS. PAIN INTENSITY WAS IDENTIFIED AS AN IMPORTANT SECONDARY OUTCOME. RESULTS: PARTICIPANT CHARACTERISTICS WERE MEAN AGE 53 YEARS, 26% WERE FEMALE, 35% WERE UNEMPLOYED OR DISABLED, AND MEAN BACK PAIN DURATION WAS 15 YEARS. IMPROVEMENTS IN ROLAND-MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE SCORES DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS AT 12 WEEKS, BUT YOGA PARTICIPANTS HAD GREATER REDUCTIONS IN ROLAND-MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE SCORES THAN DELAYED TREATMENT PARTICIPANTS AT 6 MONTHS -2.48 (95% CI= -4.08, -0.87). YOGA PARTICIPANTS IMPROVED MORE ON PAIN INTENSITY AT 12 WEEKS AND AT 6 MONTHS. OPIOID MEDICATION USE DECLINED AMONG ALL PARTICIPANTS, BUT GROUP DIFFERENCES WERE NOT FOUND. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA IMPROVED HEALTH OUTCOMES AMONG VETERANS DESPITE EVIDENCE THEY HAD FEWER RESOURCES, WORSE HEALTH, AND MORE CHALLENGES ATTENDING YOGA SESSIONS THAN COMMUNITY SAMPLES STUDIED PREVIOUSLY. THE MAGNITUDE OF PAIN INTENSITY DECLINE WAS SMALL, BUT OCCURRED IN THE CONTEXT OF REDUCED OPIOID USE. THE FINDINGS SUPPORT WIDER IMPLEMENTATION OF YOGA PROGRAMS FOR VETERANS.

19 2132  49 THE EFFECTS OF A GENTLE YOGA PROGRAM ON SLEEP, MOOD, AND BLOOD PRESSURE IN OLDER WOMEN WITH RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS): A PRELIMINARY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE. TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA VERSUS AN EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM ON SLEEP, MOOD, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND SYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION IN OLDER WOMEN WITH RLS. METHODS. PARTICIPANTS WERE DRAWN FROM A LARGER TRIAL REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK PROFILES IN OVERWEIGHT, SEDENTARY POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. SEVENTY-FIVE WOMEN WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE EITHER AN 8-WEEK YOGA (N = 38) OR EDUCATIONAL FILM (N = 37) PROGRAM. ALL 75 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED AN RLS SCREENING QUESTIONNAIRE. THE 20 WOMEN WHO MET ALL FOUR DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR RLS (N = 10 YOGA, 10 FILM GROUP) COMPRISED THE POPULATION FOR THIS NESTED STUDY. MAIN OUTCOMES ASSESSED PRE- AND POST-TREATMENT INCLUDED: SLEEP (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX), STRESS (PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE), MOOD (PROFILE OF MOOD STATES, STATE-TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY), BLOOD PRESSURE, AND HEART RATE. RESULTS. THE YOGA GROUP DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENTS THAN CONTROLS IN MULTIPLE DOMAINS OF SLEEP QUALITY AND MOOD, AND SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER REDUCTIONS IN INSOMNIA PREVALENCE, ANXIETY, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND BLOOD PRESSURE (ALL P'S</=0.05). ADJUSTED INTERGROUP EFFECT SIZES FOR PSYCHOSOCIAL VARIABLES WERE LARGE, RANGING FROM 1.9 FOR STATE ANXIETY TO 2.6 FOR SLEEP QUALITY. CONCLUSIONS. THESE PRELIMINARY FINDINGS SUGGEST YOGA MAY OFFER AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR IMPROVING SLEEP, MOOD, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND BLOOD PRESSURE IN OLDER WOMEN WITH RLS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
20 1224  48 FEASIBILITY AND ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME MEASURES FOR YOGA AS SELF-CARE FOR MINORITIES WITH ARTHRITIS: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: WHILE THERE IS A GROWING INTEREST IN THE THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS OF YOGA, MINORITY POPULATIONS WITH ARTHRITIS TEND TO BE UNDER-REPRESENTED IN THE RESEARCH. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS AN ABSENCE OF GUIDANCE IN THE LITERATURE REGARDING THE USE OF MULTICULTURAL TEAMS AND SOCIOCULTURAL HEALTH BELIEFS, WHEN DESIGNING YOGA STUDIES FOR A RACIALLY DIVERSE POPULATION WITH ARTHRITIS. THIS PILOT STUDY EXAMINED THE FEASIBILITY OF OFFERING YOGA AS A SELF-CARE MODALITY TO AN URBAN, BILINGUAL, MINORITY POPULATION WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) OR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA), IN THE WASHINGTON, DC AREA. METHODS: THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF OFFERING AN 8-WEEK, BILINGUAL YOGA INTERVENTION ADAPTED FOR ARTHRITIS TO A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF PRIMARILY HISPANIC AND BLACK/AFRICAN-AMERICAN ADULTS. A RACIALLY DIVERSE INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH TEAM WAS ASSEMBLED TO DESIGN A STUDY TO FACILITATE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION. THE SECOND OBJECTIVE IDENTIFIED OUTCOME MEASURES TO OPERATIONALIZE POTENTIAL FACILITATORS AND BARRIERS TO SELF-CARE AND SELF-EFFICACY. THE THIRD OBJECTIVE DETERMINED THE FEASIBILITY OF USING COMPUTER-ASSISTED SELF-INTERVIEW (CASI) FOR DATA COLLECTION. RESULTS: ENROLLED PARTICIPANTS (N = 30) WERE MOSTLY FEMALE (93%), SPANISH SPEAKING (69%), AND DIAGNOSED WITH RA (88.5%). FEASIBILITY WAS EVALUATED USING PRACTICALITY, ACCEPTABILITY, ADAPTATION, AND EXPANSION OF AN ARTHRITIS-ADAPTED YOGA INTERVENTION, MODIFIED FOR THIS POPULATION. RECRUITMENT (51%) AND PARTICIPATION (60%) RATES WERE SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND CLINICAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE STUDY POPULATION. OF THOSE ENROLLED, 18 STARTED THE INTERVENTION. FOR ADHERENCE, 12 OUT OF 18 (67%) PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE INTERVENTION. ALL (100%), WHO COMPLETED THE INTERVENTION, CONTINUED TO PRACTICE YOGA 3 MONTHS AFTER COMPLETING THE STUDY. USING NONPARAMETRIC TESTS, SELECTED OUTCOME MEASURES SHOWED A MEASURABLE CHANGE POST-INTERVENTION SUGGESTING APPROPRIATE USE IN FUTURE STUDIES. AN IN-PERSON COMPUTERIZED QUESTIONNAIRE WAS DETERMINED TO BE A FEASIBLE METHOD OF DATA COLLECTION. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS FROM THIS PILOT STUDY CONFIRM THE FEASIBILITY OF OFFERING YOGA TO THIS RACIALLY/ETHNICALLY DIVERSE POPULATION WITH ARTHRITIS. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES RECRUITMENT/RETENTION RATES, OUTCOME MEASURES WITH ERROR RATES, AND DATA COLLECTION RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A PREVIOUSLY UNDER-REPRESENTED POPULATION. SUGGESTIONS INCLUDE ALLOCATING RESOURCES FOR TRANSLATION AND USING A MULTICULTURAL DESIGN TO FACILITATE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION.

1  724 201 EFFECT OF LAUGHTER YOGA ON MOOD AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY IN PATIENTS AWAITING ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION: A PILOT STUDY. CONTEXT: RESEARCH SHOWS THAT LAUGHTER HAS MYRIAD HEALTH BENEFITS, YET THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY HAS NOT IMPLEMENTED IT FORMALLY AS A TREATMENT. PATIENTS AWAITING ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION HAVE SIGNIFICANT PHYSICAL DISABILITIES AND ARE AT RISK FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. ATTENUATED HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) IS A RISK FACTOR FOR A NEGATIVE LONG-TERM OUTCOME IN SOME PATIENTS. OBJECTIVE: THE STUDY INTENDED TO EVALUATE THE CLINICAL UTILITY OF LAUGHTER YOGA IN IMPROVING PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES IN OUTPATIENTS AWAITING ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION. POSITIVE RESULTS WOULD INDICATE PROMISING AREAS TO PURSUE IN A FOLLOW-UP STUDY. DESIGN: SIX PARTICIPANTS MET FOR 10 SESSIONS OVER 4 WEEKS. THE RESEARCH TEAM MEASURED EACH PARTICIPANT'S HEART RATE, HRV, BLOOD PRESSURE (BP), AND IMMEDIATE MOOD BEFORE AND AFTER THE LAUGHTER AND CONTROL INTERVENTIONS. THE TEAM ASSESSED PARTICIPANTS' LONGER-TERM MOOD (ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION) AT THE STUDY'S INITIATION, AFTER A NO-TREATMENT CONTROL WEEK, AND AT THE END OF THE STUDY. SETTING: THE STUDY OCCURRED AT THE DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY AND MEDICINE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER, TUCSON. PARTICIPANTS: PARTICIPANTS WERE PATIENTS AWAITING TRANSPLANTS (THREE HEART AND THREE LUNG), TWO WOMEN AND FOUR MEN (AGES 51-69 Y). PARTICIPANTS HAD RECEIVED NO MAJOR SURGERY IN THE 3 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE INTERVENTION, DID NOT HAVE A HERNIA OR UNCONTROLLED HYPERTENSION, AND DID NOT FALL INTO THE NEW YORK HEART ASSOCIATION FUNCTION CLASS 4. INTERVENTION: THE 20-MINUTE LAUGHTER INTERVENTION INVOLVED BREATHING AND STRETCHING EXERCISES, SIMULATED LAUGHTER (IE, UNCONDITIONAL LAUGHTER THAT IS NOT CONTINGENT ON THE ENVIRONMENT), CHANTING, CLAPPING, AND A MEDITATION. THE 20-MINUTE CONTROL INTERVENTION INVOLVED THE STUDY'S PERSONNEL DISCUSSING HEALTH AND STUDY-RELATED TOPICS WITH THE PARTICIPANTS. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE RESEARCH TEAM MEASURED BP, HEART RATE, AND HRV AND ADMINISTERED THE PROFILE OF MOOD STATES, BECK ANXIETY INVENTORY, AND BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY-II TO EVALUATE IMMEDIATE AND LONGER-TERM MOOD. THE TEAM HAD PLANNED QUANTITATIVE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE DATA AT THE STUDY'S INITIATION BUT DID NOT COMPLETE IT BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF ENROLLED PARTICIPANTS WAS TOO LOW FOR THE ANALYSIS TO BE MEANINGFUL. THE TEAM VISUALLY EXAMINED THE DATA, HOWEVER, FOR TRENDS THAT WOULD INDICATE AREAS TO EXAMINE FURTHER IN A FOLLOW-UP STUDY. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS SHOWED IMPROVED IMMEDIATE MOOD (VIGOR-ACTIVITY AND FRIENDLINESS) AND INCREASED HRV AFTER THE LAUGHTER INTERVENTION. BOTH THE LAUGHTER AND CONTROL INTERVENTIONS APPEARED TO IMPROVE LONGER-TERM ANXIETY. TWO PARTICIPANTS AWAITING A LUNG TRANSPLANT DROPPED OUT OF THE STUDY, AND NO ADVERSE EVENTS OCCURRED. CONCLUSION: THIS PILOT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT LAUGHTER YOGA MAY IMPROVE HRV AND SOME ASPECTS OF MOOD, AND THIS TOPIC WARRANTS FURTHER RESEARCH.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
2  127  41 A PILOT STUDY TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF INDIVIDUALIZED YOGA FOR INPATIENT CHILDREN RECEIVING INTENSIVE CHEMOTHERAPY. BACKGROUND: FATIGUE IS AN IMPORTANT PROBLEM IN PAEDIATRIC CANCER PATIENTS AND YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE WAS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF INDIVIDUALIZED YOGA FOR HOSPITALIZED CHILDREN RECEIVING INTENSIVE CHEMOTHERAPY. METHODS: WE INCLUDED ENGLISH-SPEAKING CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS AGED 7-18 YEARS RECEIVING INTENSIVE CHEMOTHERAPY OR HAEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION (HSCT). YOGA WAS CONDUCTED THREE TIMES WEEKLY FOR THREE WEEKS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS FEASIBILITY, DEFINED AS ABILITY TO DELIVER AT LEAST 60% OF PLANNED SESSIONS. SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE PARENT-REPORTED PEDIATRIC QUALITY OF LIFE INVENTORY (PEDSQL) MULTIDIMENSIONAL FATIGUE SCALE, FATIGUE SCALE-PARENT, PEDSQL GENERIC CORE SCALES AND PEDSQL ACUTE CANCER MODULE. RESULTS: BETWEEN JANUARY AND OCTOBER 2013, 11 PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED. MEDIAN AGE WAS 14.0 (RANGE 7.7-16.4) YEARS AND 6 (55%) WERE BOYS. YOGA WAS FEASIBLE WITH 10/11 PARTICIPANTS MEETING THE THRESHOLD FOR FEASIBILITY. THE MEDIAN NUMBER OF YOGA SESSIONS WAS 9 (RANGE 3-13). NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE ATTRIBUTED TO YOGA. MEAN+/-STANDARD DEVIATION FOR THE DAY 21 PROXY-REPORTED PEDSQL GENERAL FATIGUE SCORES WAS 55.6+/-15.5. QUALITATIVE COMMENTS SUGGESTED DESIGN CHANGES FOR FUTURE YOGA STUDIES. CONCLUSIONS: INDIVIDUALIZED YOGA IS FEASIBLE FOR INPATIENT CHILDREN RECEIVING INTENSIVE CHEMOTHERAPY. FUTURE WORK WILL INCLUDE DEVELOPMENT AND CONDUCT OF A RANDOMIZED TRIAL FOR FATIGUE AMELIORATION.

3 1331  48 HOME-BASED YOGA PROGRAM FOR THE PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM MALIGNANT LYMPHOMA DURING CHEMOTHERAPY: A FEASIBILITY STUDY. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS PROVEN BENEFICIAL IN IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY, BUT ITS EFFECTIVENESS IN LYMPHOMA PATIENTS NEEDS TO BE EXPLORED. AS CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NEUTROPENIA IS VERY COMMON AMONG LYMPHOMA PATIENTS, THEY ARE MUCH PRONE TO INFECTIONS FROM THE ENVIRONMENT. FURTHERMORE, TRAINED YOGA INSTRUCTORS ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN EVERY SETTING, SO THERE IS A NEED TO DEVELOP HOME-BASED YOGA PROGRAM MODULES FOR LYMPHOMA PATIENTS RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY. AIM: THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE THE FEASIBILITY AND SAFETY OF YOGIC EXERCISES AMONG LYMPHOMA PATIENTS DURING CHEMOTHERAPY. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: AN INTERVENTIONAL, SINGLE-ARM PREPOST DESIGN STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT A TERTIARY HEALTH-CARE CENTER. PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM MALIGNANT LYMPHOMA (18-65 YEARS) WITH EASTERN COOPERATIVE ONCOLOGY GROUP PERFORMANCE STATUS FROM 0 TO 2, PLANNED TO RECEIVE CHEMOTHERAPY WERE ADMINISTERED A HOME-BASED YOGA PROGRAM OVER A PERIOD OF 2 MONTHS FROM THE START OF CHEMOTHERAPY. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME VARIABLES WERE RETENTION RATE, ACCEPTANCE RATE, SAFETY, AND ADHERENCE. HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL), FATIGUE LEVEL, OVERALL SLEEP QUALITY, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY LEVEL, AND PAIN WERE ALSO ASSESSED. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS WAS USED TO SEE THE FEASIBILITY AND ADHERENCE. THE PAIRED T-TEST WAS USED TO COMPARE VARIOUS PRE AND POSTINTERVENTION OUTCOME MEASURES. RESULTS: FOURTEEN PATIENTS (MEDIAN AGE: 36 YEARS, RANGE13-65 YEARS) OF MALIGNANT LYMPHOMA WERE ENROLLED IN THE STUDY. MALE-TO-FEMALE RATIO WAS 9:5. NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA PATIENTS CONSTITUTED 64%. THE RECRUITMENT RATE WAS 93%. FAVORABLE RETENTION (100%), ACCEPTABILITY (97%), ADHERENCE (78.6%), AND NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS FOLLOWING YOGA PRACTICE WERE REPORTED. IMPROVEMENT WAS ALSO FOUND IN HRQOL, FATIGUE, SLEEP, DEPRESSION, AND ANXIETY. HOWEVER, IT NEEDS FURTHER VALIDATION IN A RANDOMIZED STUDY. CONCLUSION: HOME-BASED YOGA PROGRAM IS SAFE AND FEASIBLE AMONG THE PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM MALIGNANT LYMPHOMA RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
4   70  48 A FEASIBILITY STUDY EXAMINING THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON PSYCHOSOCIAL HEALTH AND SYMPTOMS IN PEDIATRIC OUTPATIENTS RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY. PURPOSE: PEDIATRIC CANCER PATIENTS EXPERIENCE SYMPTOMS THAT NEGATIVELY IMPACT QUALITY OF LIFE; YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE WAS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF A 10-WEEK, WEEKLY INDIVIDUALIZED YOGA INTERVENTION FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS RECEIVING OUTPATIENT CANCER THERAPY PRIMARILY DELIVERED REMOTELY USING SKYPE. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES WERE TO DESCRIBE DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, ANGER, FATIGUE, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND SYMPTOMS AT 5 AND 10 WEEKS AFTER ENROLLMENT. METHODS: WE INCLUDED ENGLISH-SPEAKING PATIENTS AGED 10 TO 18 YEARS RECEIVING OUTPATIENT CHEMOTHERAPY FOR CANCER. WEEKLY INDIVIDUALIZED YOGA SESSIONS WERE OFFERED FOR 10 WEEKS. WEEKS 1, 5, AND 10 WERE IN-HOSPITAL WHILE THE REMAINING SESSIONS WERE DELIVERED REMOTELY USING SKYPE. TWICE WEEKLY, HOMEWORK WAS ASSIGNED BETWEEN EACH SESSION. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS FEASIBILITY, DEFINED AS 80% OF PARTICIPANTS COMPLETING AT LEAST 60% OF PLANNED IN-HOSPITAL OR REMOTE YOGA SESSIONS. RESULTS: BETWEEN MARCH AND NOVEMBER 2017, 10 PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED. TWO PATIENTS DISCONTINUED THE STUDY AFTER ONE AND TWO SESSIONS. ONLY SIX PARTICIPANTS ACHIEVED AT LEAST 60% OF PLANNED YOGA SESSIONS AND THUS, THE STUDY DID NOT MEET THE A PRIORI DEFINED FEASIBILITY THRESHOLD. AMONG ALL PARTICIPANTS, ONLY ONE HOMEWORK SESSION WAS PERFORMED. CONCLUSIONS: A 10-WEEK INDIVIDUALIZED IN-PERSON AND REMOTELY CONDUCTED YOGA INTERVENTION WAS NOT FEASIBLE IN CHILDREN RECEIVING CANCER TREATMENTS BECAUSE OF FAILURE TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED FREQUENCY OF YOGA SESSIONS IN A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD IDENTIFY APPROACHES TO IMPROVE COMPLIANCE WITH REMOTE YOGA SESSIONS AND HOME PRACTICE.

5 1345  52 HYPERTENSION ANALYSIS OF STRESS REDUCTION USING MINDFULNESS MEDITATION AND YOGA (THE HARMONY STUDY): STUDY PROTOCOL OF A RANDOMISED CONTROL TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: HYPERTENSION (HTN) IS A LEADING RISK FACTOR FOR PREVENTABLE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, WITH OVER ONE IN FIVE ADULTS AFFECTED WORLDWIDE. LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION IS A KEY STRATEGY FOR THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF HTN. STRESS HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER CARDIOVASCULAR RISK, AND STRESS MANAGEMENT IS A RECOMMENDED INTERVENTION FOR HYPERTENSIVES. STRESS REDUCTION THROUGH RELAXATION THERAPIES HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE AN EFFECT ON HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY, INCLUDING LOWERING BLOOD PRESSURE (BP). HOWEVER, INDIVIDUALISED BEHAVIOURAL INTERVENTIONS ARE RESOURCE INTENSIVE, AND GROUP STRESS MANAGEMENT APPROACHES HAVE NOT BEEN VALIDATED FOR REDUCING HTN. THE HARMONY STUDY IS A PILOT RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL DESIGNED TO DETERMINE IF MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION (MBSR), A STANDARDISED GROUP THERAPY, IS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR LOWERING BP IN STAGE 1 UNMEDICATED HYPERTENSIVES. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: MEN AND WOMEN UNMEDICATED FOR HTN WITH MEAN DAYTIME AMBULATORY BLOOD PRESSURE (ABP) >/=135/85 MM HG OR 24 H ABP >/=130/80 MM HG ARE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. SUBJECTS ARE RANDOMISED TO RECEIVE MBSR IMMEDIATELY OR AFTER A WAIT-LIST CONTROL PERIOD. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE IS MEAN AWAKE AND 24 H ABP. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE HARMONY STUDY IS TO COMPARE ABP BETWEEN THE TREATMENT AND WAIT-LIST CONTROL ARM AT THE 12-WEEK PRIMARY ASSESSMENT PERIOD. RESULTS FROM THIS STUDY WILL DETERMINE IF MBSR IS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR LOWERING BP IN EARLY UNMEDICATED HYPERTENSIVES. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: THIS RESEARCH PROJECT WAS APPROVED BY THE SUNNYBROOK RESEARCH ETHICS BOARD AND THE UNIVERSITY HEALTH NETWORK RESEARCH ETHICS BOARD (TORONTO, CANADA).

6 1780  42 PREDICTORS OF ADHERENCE TO AN IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. CONTEXT: DESPITE THE KNOWN HEALTH BENEFITS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, PARTICIPATION RATES IN CANCER SURVIVOR GROUPS REMAIN LOW. RESEARCHERS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVE MODES OF NONTRADITIONAL PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES THAT MAY INCREASE PARTICIPATION AND ADHERENCE RATES. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE DETERMINANTS OF YOGA IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. AIM: TO EXAMINE PREDICTORS OF IYENGAR YOGA ADHERENCE IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS USING THE THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOUR. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: CLASSES WERE HELD EITHER IN CAMPUS RECREATION FACILITIES OR AT THE BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE FITNESS CENTER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA IN EDMONTON, CANADA. THE STUDY WAS AN EVALUATION OF AN EXISTING YOGA PROGRAM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TWENTY-THREE POST ADJUVANT THERAPY BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS PARTICIPATING IN A COMMUNITY-BASED, TWICE WEEKLY, 12 WEEK IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM WERE ASKED TO COMPLETE BASELINE MEASURES OF THE THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOR, DEMOGRAPHIC, MEDICAL, HEALTH/FITNESS, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL VARIABLES. ADHERENCE WAS MEASURED BY OBJECTIVE ATTENDANCE TO THE CLASSES. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: WE ANALYZED UNIVARIATE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN PREDICTORS AND YOGA ADHERENCE WITH INDEPENDENT T-TESTS. RESULTS: ADHERENCE TO THE IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM WAS 63.9% AND WAS PREDICTED BY STRONGER INTENTION (P<0.001), GREATER SELF-EFFICACY (P=0.003), MORE POSITIVE INSTRUMENTAL ATTITUDE (PS=0.025), HIGHER DISEASE STAGE (P=0.018), YOGA EXPERIENCE IN THE PAST YEAR, (P=0.044), DIAGNOSIS OF A SECOND CANCER (P=0.008), LOWER FATIGUE (P=0.037), AND GREATER HAPPINESS (P=0.023). CONCLUSIONS: ADHERENCE TO IYENGAR YOGA IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WAS STRONGLY RELATED TO MOTIVATIONAL VARIABLES FROM THE THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOUR. RESEARCHERS ATTEMPTING TO IMPROVE YOGA ADHERENCE IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS MAY BENEFIT FROM TARGETING THE KEY CONSTRUCTS IN THE THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOUR.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
7  729  41 EFFECT OF MIND SOUND RESONANCE TECHNIQUE (MSRT - A YOGA-BASED RELAXATION TECHNIQUE) ON PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIABLES AND COGNITION IN SCHOOL CHILDREN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: SCHOOL CHILDREN UNDERGO STRESS, WHICH COULD IMPACT THEIR PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS AND COGNITIVE ABILITIES. YOGA PRACTICES HAVE BEEN FOUND USEFUL IN ENHANCING PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS AND PERFORMANCE. THE CURRENT STUDY WAS PLANNED TO EVALUATE A YOGA-BASED RELAXATION TECHNIQUE'S EFFICACY AS AN EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITY ON PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION. DESIGN AND SETTING: THIS STUDY WAS A PARALLEL-GROUP RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL CONDUCTED AT A GOVERNMENT SCHOOL IN SOUTH INDIA. PARTICIPANTS: SIXTY STUDENTS WITH AGE RANGING BETWEEN 14-16 YEARS (MEAN AGE +/- SD; 15.3 +/- 0.71 YEARS) SATISFYING THE INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA WERE RANDOMIZED TO EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUPS WITH AN ALLOCATION RATIO OF 1:1. INTERVENTION: EXPERIMENTAL GROUP RECEIVED MIND SOUND RESONANCE TECHNIQUE (MSRT), WHEREAS THE CONTROL GROUP PERFORMED SUPINE REST (SR) FOR TWO-WEEKS. OUTCOME MEASURES: PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSESSED WITH STATE TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY - SHORT FORM, MIND WANDERING QUESTIONNAIRE, STATE MINDFULNESS ATTENTION AWARENESS SCALE, AND TRAIL MAKING TASK AT BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION.

8   69  46 A FEASIBILITY RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF NOVEL ACTIVITY MANAGEMENT IN SEVERE ASTHMA-TAILORED EXERCISE (NAMASTE): YOGA AND MINDFULNESS. BACKGROUND: PHYSICAL INACTIVITY IS COMMON IN SEVERE ASTHMA AND ASSOCIATED WITH POOR HEALTH OUTCOMES. NEW APPROACHES ARE NEEDED TO ADDRESS PHYSICAL INACTIVITY IN THIS GROUP. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE WHETHER YOGA AND MINDFULNESS IMPROVES HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) COMPARED WITH A MINIMAL ACTIVE CONTROL GROUP AND COLLECT FEASIBILITY DATA TO INFORM FUTURE STUDIES. METHODS: OVER 12-WEEKS, ADULTS WITH SEVERE ASTHMA WERE RECRUITED. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMISED 2:1 TO PARALLEL YOGA OR CONTROL GROUPS. ALL PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED AN ACTIVITY TRACKER. THE YOGA GROUP RECEIVED TAILORED GROUP CLASSES TWICE A WEEK FOR 16-WEEKS WITH A QUALIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTOR. THE CONTROL GROUP SET ACTIVITY GOALS WITH A RESEARCH OFFICER AND RECEIVED EIGHT PROGRESS CALLS. OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED AT 16-WEEKS. PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS ST GEORGE'S RESPIRATORY QUESTIONNAIRE (SGRQ). SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED ASTHMA CONTROL, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, BREATHLESSNESS, AND INFLAMMATION. FACE-TO-FACE QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE ACCEPTABILITY. RESULTS: THERE WERE 15 PARTICIPANTS RANDOMISED TO YOGA (MEAN 67 YEARS; 60% FEMALE) AND 9 TO CONTROL (68 YEARS; 56% FEMALE). PLANNED COMPARISONS INDICATED THE YOGA GROUP HAD GREATER SGRQ IMPROVEMENT THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. THERE WAS LITTLE CHANGE IN SECONDARY OUTCOMES. MODERATE-VIGOROUS ACTIVITY INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY IN THE CONTROL GROUP. PARTICIPANTS FOUND THE INTERVENTION ACCEPTABLE; KEY BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS WERE SOCIAL CONNECTION, THE SETTING, ADDRESSING BREATHING AND ASTHMA SYMPTOMS, CHANGING THEIR MINDSET, AND THE INTERSECTION OF DIFFERENT ELEMENTS. CONCLUSION: A YOGA AND MINDFULNESS INTERVENTION WAS FEASIBLE, ACCEPTABLE TO PATIENTS AND IMPROVED HRQOL. THE FINDINGS WILL INFORM DESIGN OF MUCH NEEDED FUTURE RESEARCH INTO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY INTERVENTIONS FOR SEVERE ASTHMA.

9 1223  44 FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF RESTORATIVE YOGA FOR TREATMENT OF HOT FLUSHES: A PILOT TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF A RESTORATIVE YOGA INTERVENTION FOR THE TREATMENT OF HOT FLUSHES IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. METHODS: A PILOT TRIAL IN 14 POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN EXPERIENCING > OR =4 MODERATE TO SEVERE HOT FLUSHES PER DAY OR > OR =30 MODERATE TO SEVERE HOT FLUSHES PER WEEK. THE INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF EIGHT RESTORATIVE YOGA POSES TAUGHT IN A 3-H INTRODUCTORY SESSION AND 8 WEEKLY 90-MIN SESSIONS. FEASIBILITY WAS MEASURED BY RECRUITMENT RATES, SUBJECT RETENTION AND ADHERENCE. ACCEPTABILITY WAS ASSESSED BY SUBJECT INTERVIEW AND QUESTIONNAIRES. EFFICACY MEASURES INCLUDED CHANGE IN FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF HOT FLUSHES AS RECORDED ON A 7-DAY DIARY. RESULTS: RECRUITMENT WAS ACCOMPLISHED AS PLANNED. THE MAJORITY OF STUDY SUBJECTS (93%) COMPLETED THE TRIAL. OF THOSE WHO COMPLETED THE TRIAL, 92% ATTENDED SEVEN OR MORE OF THE EIGHT YOGA SESSIONS. THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS WERE SATISFIED WITH THE STUDY AND 75% CONTINUED TO PRACTICE YOGA 3 MONTHS AFTER THE STUDY. MEAN NUMBER OF HOT FLUSHES PER WEEK DECREASED BY 30.8% (95% CI 15.6-45.9%) AND MEAN HOT FLUSH SCORE DECREASED 34.2% (95% CI 16.0-52.5%) FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 8. NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE OBSERVED. CONCLUSIONS: THIS PILOT TRIAL DEMONSTRATES THAT IT IS FEASIBLE TO TEACH RESTORATIVE YOGA TO MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN WITHOUT PRIOR YOGA EXPERIENCE. THE HIGH RATES OF SUBJECT RETENTION AND SATISFACTION SUGGEST THAT YOGA IS AN ACCEPTABLE INTERVENTION IN THIS POPULATION. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT A LARGER, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL TO EXPLORE THE EFFICACY OF RESTORATIVE YOGA FOR TREATMENT OF MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS WOULD BE SAFE AND FEASIBLE.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
10  258  40 ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF A 12-WEEK YOGA VS. EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS): STUDY PROTOCOL FOR A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS) IS A COMMON AND BURDENSOME SLEEP DISORDER ASSOCIATED WITH PROFOUND IMPAIRMENT OF HEALTH, WELL-BEING, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. UNFORTUNATELY, THE MEDICATIONS USED FOR RLS MANAGEMENT CARRY RISK OF SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS, INCLUDING AUGMENTATION OF SYMPTOMS. YOGA, AN ANCIENT MIND-BODY DISCIPLINE DESIGNED TO PROMOTE PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, AND MENTAL WELL-BEING, MAY OFFER A VIABLE, LOW-RISK NEW TREATMENT. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF THIS PILOT, PARALLEL-ARM, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) ARE TO ASSESS THE ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF A 12-WEEK YOGA VS. EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RLS. METHODS: FORTY-FOUR ADULTS WITH CONFIRMED MODERATE TO SEVERE RLS WILL BE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED TO A 12-WEEK YOGA (N = 22) OR STANDARDIZED EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM (N = 22). YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS WILL ATTEND TWO 75-MIN IYENGAR YOGA CLASSES PER WEEK FOR THE FIRST 4 WEEKS, THEN ONE 75-MIN CLASS PER WEEK FOR THE REMAINING 8 WEEKS, AND WILL COMPLETE A 30-MIN HOMEWORK ROUTINE ON NON-CLASS DAYS. EDUCATIONAL FILM GROUP PARTICIPANTS WILL ATTEND ONE 75-MIN CLASS PER WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS AND COMPLETE A DAILY RLS TREATMENT LOG; CLASSES WILL INCLUDE INFORMATION ON: RLS MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING SLEEP HYGIENE PRACTICES; OTHER SLEEP DISORDERS; AND COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES LIKELY TO BE OF INTEREST TO THOSE PARTICIPATING IN A YOGA AND SLEEP EDUCATION STUDY. YOGA AND TREATMENT LOGS WILL BE COLLECTED WEEKLY. FEASIBILITY OUTCOMES WILL INCLUDE RECRUITMENT, ENROLLMENT, AND RANDOMIZATION RATES, RETENTION, ADHERENCE, AND PROGRAM SATISFACTION. PROGRAM EVALUATION AND YOGA-DOSING QUESTIONNAIRES WILL BE COLLECTED AT WEEK 12; DATA ON EXPLORATORY OUTCOMES (E.G., RLS SYMPTOM SEVERITY (IRLS), SLEEP QUALITY (PSQI), MOOD (POMS, PSS), AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (SF-36)) WILL BE GATHERED AT BASELINE AND WEEK 12. DISCUSSION: THIS STUDY WILL LAY THE ESSENTIAL GROUNDWORK FOR A PLANNED LARGER RCT TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF A YOGA PROGRAM FOR REDUCING SYMPTOMS AND ASSOCIATED BURDEN OF RLS. IF THE FINDINGS OF THE CURRENT TRIAL AND THE SUBSEQUENT LARGER RCTS ARE POSITIVE, THIS STUDY WILL ALSO HELP SUPPORT A NEW APPROACH TO CLINICAL TREATMENT OF THIS CHALLENGING DISORDER, HELP FOSTER IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF RLS ETIOLOGY, AND ULTIMATELY CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCING THE INDIVIDUAL, SOCIETAL, AND ECONOMIC BURDEN ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CONDITION.

11 1346  44 HYPERTENSION ANALYSIS OF STRESS REDUCTION USING MINDFULNESS MEDITATION AND YOGA: RESULTS FROM THE HARMONY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: THE HARMONY STUDY WAS A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL EXAMINING THE EFFICACY OF AN 8-WEEK MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION (MBSR) PROGRAM FOR BLOOD PRESSURE (BP) LOWERING AMONG UNMEDICATED STAGE 1 HYPERTENSIVE PARTICIPANTS. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS DIAGNOSED WITH STAGE 1 HYPERTENSION BASED ON AMBULATORY BP WERE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER IMMEDIATE TREATMENT OF MBSR FOR 8 WEEKS OR WAIT-LIST CONTROL. PRIMARY OUTCOME ANALYSIS EVALUATED WHETHER CHANGE IN AWAKE AND 24-HOUR AMBULATORY BP FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 12 WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE 2 GROUPS. A WITHIN-GROUP BEFORE AND AFTER MBSR ANALYSIS WAS ALSO PERFORMED. RESULTS: THE STUDY ENROLLED 101 ADULTS (38% MALE) WITH BASELINE AVERAGE 24-HOUR AMBULATORY BP OF 135+/-7.9/82+/-5.8MM HG AND DAYTIME AMBULATORY BP OF 140+/-7.7/87+/-6.3 MMHG. AT WEEK 12, THE CHANGE FROM BASELINE IN 24-HOUR AMBULATORY BP WAS 0.4+/-6.7/0.0+/-4.9MM HG FOR THE IMMEDIATE INTERVENTION AND 0.4+/-7.8/-0.4+/-4.6MM HG FOR THE WAIT-LIST CONTROL. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INTERVENTION AND WAIT-LIST CONTROL FOR ALL AMBULATORY BP PARAMETERS. THE SECONDARY WITHIN-GROUP ANALYSIS FOUND A SMALL REDUCTION IN BP AFTER MBSR COMPARED WITH BASELINE, A FINDING LIMITED TO FEMALE SUBJECTS IN A SEX ANALYSIS. CONCLUSIONS: MBSR DID NOT LOWER AMBULATORY BP BY A STATISTICALLY OR CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT IN UNTREATED, STAGE 1 HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS WHEN COMPARED WITH A WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP. IT LEAVES UNTESTED WHETHER MBSR MIGHT BE USEFUL FOR LOWERING BP BY IMPROVING ADHERENCE IN TREATED HYPERTENSIVE PARTICIPANTS.

12 1902  47 RESTORATIVE YOGA IN ADULTS WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME: A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED PILOT TRIAL. BACKGROUND: METABOLIC SYNDROME INCREASES THE RISK OF DIABETES AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. YOGA IMPROVES SOME METABOLIC PARAMETERS, BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED IN PERSONS WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME. WE CONDUCTED A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT TRIAL TO DETERMINE WHETHER A RESTORATIVE YOGA INTERVENTION WAS FEASIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE IN UNDERACTIVE, OVERWEIGHT ADULTS WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME. METHODS: TWENTY SIX UNDERACTIVE, OVERWEIGHT ADULT MEN AND WOMEN WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME WERE RANDOMIZED TO ATTEND 15 YOGA SESSIONS OF 90 MINUTES EACH OVER 10 WEEKS OR TO A WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP. FEASIBILITY WAS MEASURED BY RECRUITMENT RATES, SUBJECT RETENTION, AND ADHERENCE. ACCEPTABILITY WAS ASSESSED BY INTERVIEW AND QUESTIONNAIRES. CHANGES IN METABOLIC OUTCOMES AND QUESTIONNAIRE MEASURES FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 10 WERE CALCULATED. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 280 PEOPLE WERE SCREENED BY PHONE, AND 93 WITH HIGH LIKELIHOOD OF METABOLIC SYNDROME WERE INVITED TO A SCREENING VISIT. OF THE 68 WHO ATTENDED SCREENING VISITS, 26 (38%) WERE RANDOMIZED, AND 24 (92%) COMPLETED THE TRIAL. ATTENDANCE AT YOGA CLASSES AND ADHERENCE TO HOME PRACTICE EXCEEDED OUR GOALS. IN THE YOGA GROUP, ALL PARTICIPANTS GAVE THE STUDY THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE SATISFACTION RATING, AND THE MAJORITY (87%) FELT THAT THE YOGA POSES WERE EASY TO PERFORM. THERE WAS TREND TO REDUCED BLOOD PRESSURE (P = 0.07), A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN ENERGY LEVEL (P < 0.009), AND TRENDS TO IMPROVEMENT IN WELL-BEING (P < 0.12) AND STRESS (P < 0.22) IN THE YOGA VERSUS CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: RESTORATIVE YOGA WAS A FEASIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE INTERVENTION IN OVERWEIGHT ADULTS WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME. THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR IMPROVING METABOLIC PARAMETERS IN THIS POPULATION SHOULD BE EXPLORED IN A LARGER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
13 2639  54 YOGA FOR VETERANS WITH CHRONIC LOW-BACK PAIN. OBJECTIVES: CHRONIC BACK PAIN AFFECTS A LARGE PROPORTION OF BOTH THE GENERAL POPULATION AND OF MILITARY VETERANS. ALTHOUGH NUMEROUS THERAPIES EXIST FOR TREATING CHRONIC BACK PAIN, THEY CAN BE COSTLY AND TEND TO HAVE LIMITED EFFECTIVENESS. THUS, DEMONSTRATING THE EFFICACY AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF ADDITIONAL TREATMENT ALTERNATIVES IS IMPORTANT. THE PURPOSE OF OUR STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE BENEFITS OF A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR VETERANS ADMINISTRATION (VA) PATIENTS. SUBJECTS/INTERVENTION: VA PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC BACK PAIN WERE REFERRED BY THEIR PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS TO A YOGA PROGRAM AS PART OF CLINICAL CARE. BEFORE STARTING YOGA, A VA PHYSICIAN TRAINED IN YOGA EVALUATED EACH PATIENT TO ENSURE THAT THEY COULD PARTICIPATE SAFELY. DESIGN: THE RESEARCH STUDY CONSISTED OF COMPLETING A SHORT BATTERY OF QUESTIONNAIRES AT BASELINE AND AGAIN 10 WEEKS LATER. OUTCOME MEASURES: QUESTIONNAIRES INCLUDED MEASURES OF PAIN, DEPRESSION, ENERGY/FATIGUE, HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, AND PROGRAM SATISFACTION. PAIRED T-TESTS WERE USED TO COMPARE BASELINE SCORES TO THOSE AT THE 10-WEEK FOLLOW-UP FOR THE SINGLE GROUP, PRE-POST DESIGN. CORRELATIONS WERE USED TO EXAMINE WHETHER YOGA ATTENDANCE AND HOME PRACTICE WERE ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER OUTCOMES. RESULTS: BASELINE AND FOLLOW-UP DATA WERE AVAILABLE FOR 33 PARTICIPANTS. PARTICIPANTS WERE VA PATIENTS WITH A MEAN AGE OF 55 YEARS. THEY WERE 21% FEMALE, 70% WHITE, 52% MARRIED, 68% COLLEGE GRADUATES, AND 44% WERE RETIRED. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE FOUND FOR PAIN, DEPRESSION, ENERGY/FATIGUE, AND THE SHORT FORM-12 MENTAL HEALTH SCALE. THE NUMBER OF YOGA SESSIONS ATTENDED AND THE FREQUENCY OF HOME PRACTICE WERE ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED OUTCOMES. PARTICIPANTS APPEARED HIGHLY SATISFIED WITH THE YOGA INSTRUCTOR AND MODERATELY SATISFIED WITH THE EASE OF PARTICIPATION AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF THE YOGA PROGRAM. CONCLUSIONS: PRELIMINARY DATA SUGGEST THAT A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR VA PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC BACK PAIN MAY IMPROVE THE HEALTH OF VETERANS. HOWEVER, THE LIMITATIONS OF A PRE-POST STUDY DESIGN MAKE CONCLUSIONS TENTATIVE. A LARGER RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL OF THE YOGA PROGRAM IS PLANNED.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
14  162  49 A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: RESULTS OF A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO CONDUCT A PILOT TRIAL OF YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (LBP) TO INFORM THE FEASIBILITY AND PRACTICALITY OF CONDUCTING A FULL-SCALE TRIAL IN THE UK; AND TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. DESIGN: A PRAGMATIC RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS UNDERTAKEN COMPARING YOGA TO USUAL CARE. PARTICIPANTS: TWENTY PARTICIPANTS WHO HAD PRESENTED TO THEIR GP WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN IN THE PREVIOUS 18 MONTHS WERE RECRUITED VIA GP RECORDS FROM ONE PRACTICE IN YORK, UK. INTERVENTIONS: TWENTY PATIENTS WERE RANDOMISED TO EITHER 12 WEEKLY 75-MIN SESSIONS OF SPECIALISED YOGA PLUS WRITTEN ADVICE, OR USUAL CARE PLUS WRITTEN ADVICE. ALLOCATION WAS 50/50. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: RECRUITMENT RATE, LEVELS OF INTERVENTION ATTENDANCE, AND LOSS TO FOLLOW-UP WERE THE MAIN NON-CLINICAL OUTCOMES. CHANGE AS MEASURED BY THE ROLAND AND MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE WAS THE PRIMARY CLINICAL OUTCOME. CHANGES IN THE ABERDEEN BACK PAIN SCALE, SF-12, EQ-5D, AND PAIN SELF-EFFICACY WERE SECONDARY CLINICAL OUTCOMES. DATA WERE COLLECTED VIA POSTAL QUESTIONNAIRE AT BASELINE, 4 WEEKS, AND 12 WEEKS FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: OF THE 286 PATIENTS IDENTIFIED FROM THE GP DATABASE, 52 (18%) CONSENTED AND RETURNED THE ELIGIBILITY QUESTIONNAIRE, OUT OF THESE 20 (6.9%) WERE ELIGIBLE AND RANDOMISED. THE TOTAL PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS RANDOMISED FROM THE GP PRACTICE POPULATION WAS 0.28%. TEN PATIENTS WERE RANDOMISED TO YOGA, RECEIVING AN AVERAGE OF 1.7 SESSIONS (RANGE 0-5), AND 10 WERE RANDOMISED TO USUAL CARE. AT 12 WEEKS FOLLOW-UP DATA WAS RECEIVED FROM 60% OF PATIENTS IN THE YOGA GROUP AND 90% OF PATIENTS IN THE USUAL CARE GROUP (75% OVERALL). NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE SEEN BETWEEN GROUPS IN CLINICAL OUTCOMES APART FROM ON THE ABERDEEN BACK PAIN SCALE AT FOUR WEEKS FOLLOW-UP WHERE THE YOGA GROUP REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY LESS PAIN. CONCLUSION: THIS PILOT STUDY PROVIDED USEFUL DATA AND INFORMATION TO INFORM THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF A FULL-SCALE TRIAL OF YOGA FOR CLBP IN THE UK. A KEY FINDING IS THE CALCULATION OF GP PRACTICE TOTAL LIST SIZE REQUIRED FOR PATIENT RECRUITMENT IN A FULL-SCALE TRIAL, AND THE NEED TO IMPLEMENT METHODS TO INCREASE CLASS ATTENDANCE.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
15 2657  67 YOGA IN ADDITION TO STANDARD CARE FOR PATIENTS WITH HAEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES. BACKGROUND: HAEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES ARE MALIGNANT NEOPLASMS OF THE MYELOID OR LYMPHATIC CELL LINES INCLUDING LEUKAEMIA, LYMPHOMA AND MYELOMA. IN ORDER TO MANAGE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF THE DISEASE AND ITS TREATMENT, COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES LIKE YOGA ARE COMING INCREASINGLY INTO FOCUS. HOWEVER, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA PRACTICE FOR PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM HAEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES REMAINS UNCLEAR. OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA PRACTICE IN ADDITION TO STANDARD CANCER TREATMENT FOR PEOPLE WITH HAEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES. SEARCH METHODS: OUR SEARCH STRATEGY INCLUDED THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950 TO 4TH FEBRUARY 2014), DATABASES OF ONGOING TRIALS (CONTROLLED-TRIALS.COM; CLINICALTRIALS.GOV), CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY, THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF HEMATOLOGY, THE EUROPEAN HAEMATOLOGY ASSOCIATION, THE EUROPEAN CONGRESS FOR INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE, AND GLOBAL ADVANCES IN HEALTH AND MEDICINE. WE HANDSEARCHED REFERENCES OF THESE STUDIES FROM IDENTIFIED TRIALS AND RELEVANT REVIEW ARTICLES. TWO REVIEW AUTHORS INDEPENDENTLY SCREENED THE SEARCH RESULTS. SELECTION CRITERIA: WE INCLUDED RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) OF YOGA IN ADDITION TO STANDARD CARE FOR HAEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES COMPARED WITH STANDARD CARE ONLY. WE DID NOT RESTRICT THIS TO ANY SPECIFIC STYLE OF YOGA. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: TWO REVIEW AUTHORS INDEPENDENTLY EXTRACTED DATA FOR ELIGIBLE STUDIES AND ASSESSED THE RISK OF BIAS ACCORDING TO PREDEFINED CRITERIA. WE EVALUATED DISTRESS, FATIGUE, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND QUALITY OF SLEEP. FURTHER OUTCOMES WE PLANNED TO ASSESS WERE HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL), OVERALL SURVIVAL (OS) AND ADVERSE EVENTS (AE), BUT DATA ON THESE WERE NOT AVAILABLE. MAIN RESULTS: OUR SEARCH STRATEGIES LED TO 149 POTENTIALLY RELEVANT REFERENCES, BUT ONLY A SINGLE SMALL STUDY MET OUR INCLUSION CRITERIA. THE INCLUDED STUDY WAS PUBLISHED AS A FULL TEXT ARTICLE AND INVESTIGATED THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFECT OF TIBETAN YOGA ADDITIONAL TO STANDARD CARE (N = 20; 1 PERSON DROPPED OUT BEFORE ATTENDING ANY CLASSES AND NO DATA WERE COLLECTED) COMPARED TO STANDARD CARE ONLY (N = 19). THE STUDY INCLUDED PEOPLE WITH ALL STAGES OF HODGKIN AND NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA, WITH AND WITHOUT CURRENT CANCER TREATMENT. THE MEAN AGE WAS 51 YEARS.WE JUDGED THE OVERALL RISK OF BIAS AS HIGH AS WE FOUND A HIGH RISK FOR PERFORMANCE, DETECTION AND ATTRITION BIAS. ADDITIONALLY, POTENTIAL OUTCOME REPORTING BIAS COULD NOT BE COMPLETELY RULED OUT. FOLLOWING THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF GRADE, WE JUDGED THE OVERALL QUALITY OF THE BODY OF EVIDENCE FOR ALL PREDEFINED OUTCOMES AS 'VERY LOW', DUE TO THE METHODICAL LIMITATIONS AND THE VERY SMALL SAMPLE SIZE.THE INFLUENCE OF YOGA ON HRQOL AND OS WAS NOT REPORTED. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT YOGA IN ADDITION TO STANDARD CARE COMPARED WITH STANDARD CARE ONLY CAN IMPROVE DISTRESS IN PEOPLE WITH HAEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES (MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) -0.30, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) -5.55 TO 4.95; P = 0.91). SIMILARLY, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EITHER GROUP FOR FATIGUE (MD 0.00, 95% CI -0.94 TO 0.94; P = 1.00), ANXIETY (MD 0.30, 95% CI -5.01 TO 5.61; P = 0.91) OR DEPRESSION (MD -0.70, 95% CI -3.21 TO 1.81; P = 0.58).THERE IS VERY LOW QUALITY EVIDENCE THAT YOGA IMPROVES THE OVERALL QUALITY OF SLEEP (MD -2.30, 95% CI -3.78 TO -0.82; P = 0.002). THE YOGA GROUPS' TOTAL SCORE FOR THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI) WAS 5.8 (+/- 2.3 SD) AND BETTER THAN THE TOTAL SCORE (8.1 (+/- 2.4 SD)) OF THE CONTROL GROUP. A PSQI TOTAL SCORE OF 0 TO 5 INDICATES GOOD SLEEP WHEREAS PSQI TOTAL SCORE 6 TO 21 POINTS TOWARDS SIGNIFICANT SLEEP DISTURBANCES. THE OCCURRENCE OF AES WAS NOT REPORTED. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE DATA PROVIDE LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM HAEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES. THE FINDING THAT YOGA MAY BE BENEFICIAL FOR THE PATIENTS' QUALITY OF SLEEP IS BASED ON A VERY SMALL BODY OF EVIDENCE. THEREFORE, THE ROLE OF YOGA AS AN ADDITIONAL THERAPY FOR HAEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES REMAINS UNCLEAR. FURTHER HIGH-QUALITY RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS WITH LARGER NUMBERS OF PARTICIPANTS ARE NEEDED TO MAKE A DEFINITIVE STATEMENT.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
16 2636  63 YOGA FOR TREATING URINARY INCONTINENCE IN WOMEN. BACKGROUND: URINARY INCONTINENCE IN WOMEN IS ASSOCIATED WITH POOR QUALITY OF LIFE AND DIFFICULTIES IN SOCIAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SEXUAL FUNCTIONING. THE CONDITION MAY AFFECT UP TO 15% OF MIDDLE-AGED OR OLDER WOMEN IN THE GENERAL POPULATION. CONSERVATIVE TREATMENTS SUCH AS LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS, BLADDER TRAINING AND PELVIC FLOOR MUSCLE TRAINING (USED EITHER ALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER INTERVENTIONS) ARE THE INITIAL APPROACHES TO THE MANAGEMENT OF URINARY INCONTINENCE. MANY WOMEN ARE INTERESTED IN ADDITIONAL TREATMENTS SUCH AS YOGA, A SYSTEM OF PHILOSOPHY, LIFESTYLE AND PHYSICAL PRACTICE THAT ORIGINATED IN ANCIENT INDIA. OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA FOR TREATING URINARY INCONTINENCE IN WOMEN. SEARCH METHODS: WE SEARCHED THE COCHRANE INCONTINENCE AND COCHRANE COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE SPECIALISED REGISTERS. WE SEARCHED THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION INTERNATIONAL CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRY PLATFORM (WHO ICTRP) AND CLINICALTRIALS.GOV TO IDENTIFY ANY ONGOING OR UNPUBLISHED STUDIES. WE HANDSEARCHED PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE RESEARCH AND THE EUROPEAN CONGRESS FOR INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE. WE SEARCHED THE NHS ECONOMIC EVALUATION DATABASE FOR ECONOMIC STUDIES, AND SUPPLEMENTED THIS SEARCH WITH SEARCHES FOR ECONOMICS STUDIES IN MEDLINE AND EMBASE FROM 2015 ONWARDS. DATABASE SEARCHES ARE UP-TO-DATE AS OF 21 JUNE 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA: RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS IN WOMEN DIAGNOSED WITH URINARY INCONTINENCE IN WHICH ONE GROUP WAS ALLOCATED TO TREATMENT WITH YOGA. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: TWO REVIEW AUTHORS INDEPENDENTLY SCREENED TITLES AND ABSTRACTS OF ALL RETRIEVED ARTICLES, SELECTED STUDIES FOR INCLUSION, EXTRACTED DATA, ASSESSED RISK OF BIAS AND EVALUATED THE CERTAINTY OF THE EVIDENCE FOR EACH REPORTED OUTCOME. ANY DISAGREEMENTS WERE RESOLVED BY CONSENSUS. WE PLANNED TO COMBINE CLINICALLY COMPARABLE STUDIES IN REVIEW MANAGER 5 USING RANDOM-EFFECTS META-ANALYSIS AND TO CARRY OUT SENSITIVITY AND SUBGROUP ANALYSES. WE PLANNED TO CREATE A TABLE LISTING ECONOMIC STUDIES ON YOGA FOR INCONTINENCE BUT NOT CARRY OUT ANY ANALYSES ON THESE STUDIES. MAIN RESULTS: WE INCLUDED TWO STUDIES (INVOLVING A TOTAL OF 49 WOMEN). EACH STUDY COMPARED YOGA TO A DIFFERENT COMPARATOR, THEREFORE WE WERE UNABLE TO COMBINE THE DATA IN A META-ANALYSIS. A THIRD STUDY THAT HAS BEEN COMPLETED BUT NOT YET FULLY REPORTED IS AWAITING ASSESSMENT.ONE INCLUDED STUDY WAS A SIX-WEEK STUDY COMPARING YOGA TO A WAITING LIST IN 19 WOMEN WITH EITHER URGENCY URINARY INCONTINENCE OR STRESS URINARY INCONTINENCE. WE JUDGED THE CERTAINTY OF THE EVIDENCE FOR ALL REPORTED OUTCOMES AS VERY LOW DUE TO PERFORMANCE BIAS, DETECTION BIAS, AND IMPRECISION. THE NUMBER OF WOMEN REPORTING CURE WAS NOT REPORTED. WE ARE UNCERTAIN WHETHER YOGA RESULTS IN SATISFACTION WITH CURE OR IMPROVEMENT OF INCONTINENCE (RISK RATIO (RR) 6.33, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) 1.44 TO 27.88; AN INCREASE OF 592 FROM 111 PER 1000, 95% CI 160 TO 1000). WE ARE UNCERTAIN WHETHER THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOGA AND WAITING LIST IN CONDITION-SPECIFIC QUALITY OF LIFE AS MEASURED ON THE INCONTINENCE IMPACT QUESTIONNAIRE SHORT FORM (MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) 1.74, 95% CI -33.02 TO 36.50); THE NUMBER OF MICTURITIONS (MD -0.77, 95% CI -2.13 TO 0.59); THE NUMBER OF INCONTINENCE EPISODES (MD -1.57, 95% CI -2.83 TO -0.31); OR THE BOTHERSOMENESS OF INCONTINENCE AS MEASURED ON THE UROGENITAL DISTRESS INVENTORY 6 (MD -0.90, 95% CI -1.46 TO -0.34). THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A DIFFERENCE IN THE NUMBER OF WOMEN WHO EXPERIENCED AT LEAST ONE ADVERSE EVENT (RISK DIFFERENCE 0%, 95% CI -38% TO 38%; NO DIFFERENCE FROM 222 PER 1000, 95% CI 380 FEWER TO 380 MORE).THE SECOND INCLUDED STUDY WAS AN EIGHT-WEEK STUDY IN 30 WOMEN WITH URGENCY URINARY INCONTINENCE THAT COMPARED MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION (MBSR) TO AN ACTIVE CONTROL INTERVENTION OF YOGA CLASSES. THE STUDY WAS UNBLINDED, AND THERE WAS HIGH ATTRITION FROM BOTH STUDY ARMS FOR ALL OUTCOME ASSESSMENTS. WE JUDGED THE CERTAINTY OF THE EVIDENCE FOR ALL REPORTED OUTCOMES AS VERY LOW DUE TO PERFORMANCE BIAS, ATTRITION BIAS, IMPRECISION AND INDIRECTNESS. THE NUMBER OF WOMEN REPORTING CURE WAS NOT REPORTED. WE ARE UNCERTAIN WHETHER WOMEN IN THE YOGA GROUP WERE LESS LIKELY TO REPORT IMPROVEMENT IN INCONTINENCE AT EIGHT WEEKS COMPARED TO WOMEN IN THE MBSR GROUP (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 TO 1.43; A DECREASE OF 419 FROM 461 PER 1000, 95% CI 5 TO 660). WE ARE UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MBSR COMPARED TO YOGA ON REPORTS OF CURE OR IMPROVEMENT IN INCONTINENCE, IMPROVEMENT IN CONDITION-SPECIFIC QUALITY OF LIFE MEASURED ON THE OVERACTIVE BLADDER HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE SCALE, REDUCTION IN INCONTINENCE EPISODES OR REDUCTION IN BOTHERSOMENESS OF INCONTINENCE AS MEASURED ON THE OVERACTIVE BLADDER SYMPTOM AND QUALITY OF LIFE-SHORT FORM AT EIGHT WEEKS. THE STUDY DID NOT REPORT ON ADVERSE EFFECTS. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: WE IDENTIFIED FEW TRIALS ON YOGA FOR INCONTINENCE, AND THE EXISTING TRIALS WERE SMALL AND AT HIGH RISK OF BIAS. IN ADDITION, WE DID NOT FIND ANY STUDIES OF ECONOMIC OUTCOMES RELATED TO YOGA FOR URINARY INCONTINENCE. DUE TO THE LACK OF EVIDENCE TO ANSWER THE REVIEW QUESTION, WE ARE UNCERTAIN WHETHER YOGA IS USEFUL FOR WOMEN WITH URINARY INCONTINENCE. ADDITIONAL, WELL-CONDUCTED TRIALS WITH LARGER SAMPLE SIZES ARE NEEDED.	2019	

17 2836  54 YOGA'S IMPACT ON INFLAMMATION, MOOD, AND FATIGUE IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. PURPOSE: TO EVALUATE YOGA'S IMPACT ON INFLAMMATION, MOOD, AND FATIGUE. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED 3-MONTH TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED WITH TWO POST-TREATMENT ASSESSMENTS OF 200 BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS ASSIGNED TO EITHER 12 WEEKS OF 90-MINUTE TWICE PER WEEK HATHA YOGA CLASSES OR A WAIT-LIST CONTROL. THE MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES WERE LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE-STIMULATED PRODUCTION OF PROINFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES INTERLEUKIN-6 (IL-6), TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR ALPHA (TNF-ALPHA), AND INTERLEUKIN-1BETA (IL-1BETA), AND SCORES ON THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL FATIGUE SYMPTOM INVENTORY-SHORT FORM (MFSI-SF), THE VITALITY SCALE FROM THE MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY 36-ITEM SHORT FORM (SF-36), AND THE CENTER FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES-DEPRESSION (CES-D) SCALE. RESULTS: IMMEDIATELY POST-TREATMENT, FATIGUE WAS NOT LOWER (P > .05) BUT VITALITY WAS HIGHER (P = .01) IN THE YOGA GROUP COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. AT 3 MONTHS POST-TREATMENT, FATIGUE WAS LOWER IN THE YOGA GROUP (P = .002), VITALITY WAS HIGHER (P = .01), AND IL-6 (P = .027), TNF-ALPHA (P = .027), AND IL-1BETA (P = .037) WERE LOWER FOR YOGA PARTICIPANTS COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. GROUPS DID NOT DIFFER ON DEPRESSION AT EITHER TIME (P > .2). PLANNED SECONDARY ANALYSES SHOWED THAT THE FREQUENCY OF YOGA PRACTICE HAD STRONGER ASSOCIATIONS WITH FATIGUE AT BOTH POST-TREATMENT VISITS (P = .019; P < .001), AS WELL AS VITALITY (P = .016; P = .0045), BUT NOT DEPRESSION (P > .05) THAN SIMPLE GROUP ASSIGNMENT; MORE FREQUENT PRACTICE PRODUCED LARGER CHANGES. AT 3 MONTHS POST-TREATMENT, INCREASING YOGA PRACTICE ALSO LED TO A DECREASE IN IL-6 (P = .01) AND IL-1BETA (P = .03) PRODUCTION BUT NOT IN TNF-ALPHA PRODUCTION (P > .05). CONCLUSION: CHRONIC INFLAMMATION MAY FUEL DECLINES IN PHYSICAL FUNCTION LEADING TO FRAILTY AND DISABILITY. IF YOGA DAMPENS OR LIMITS BOTH FATIGUE AND INFLAMMATION, THEN REGULAR PRACTICE COULD HAVE SUBSTANTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
18 2811  51 YOGA TO PREVENT MOBILITY LIMITATIONS IN OLDER ADULTS: FEASIBILITY OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: THE LOSS OF MOBILITY DURING AGING IMPACTS INDEPENDENCE AND LEADS TO FURTHER DISABILITY, MORBIDITY, AND REDUCED LIFE EXPECTANCY. OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND SAFETY OF CONDUCTING A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA FOR OLDER ADULTS AT RISK FOR MOBILITY LIMITATIONS. METHODS: SEDENTARY OLDER ADULTS (N = 46; AGE 60-89) WERE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED TO EITHER YOGA OR A HEALTH EDUCATION COMPARISON GROUP. YOGA SESSIONS (60-MIN) OCCURRED 2X WEEKLY, AND 90-MIN HEALTH EDUCATION SESSIONS OCCURRED WEEKLY, FOR 10 WEEKS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE RECRUITMENT RATE, INTERVENTION ATTENDANCE, AND RETENTION AT ASSESSMENTS. ADVERSE EVENT RATES AND PARTICIPANT SATISFACTION WERE ALSO MEASURED. PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES OF GAIT, BALANCE, AND STRENGTH AND SELF-REPORT OUTCOME MEASURES WERE ADMINISTERED AT BASELINE AND 10-WEEKS. RESULTS: RECRUITMENT LASTED 6 MONTHS. RETENTION OF PARTICIPANTS AT THE 10-WEEK FOLLOW-UP WAS HIGH (89% - PERFORMANCE MEASURES; 98% - SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES). ATTENDANCE WAS GOOD WITH 82% OF YOGA AND 74% OF HEALTH EDUCATION PARTICIPANTS ATTENDING AT LEAST 50% OF THE SESSIONS. NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. PATIENT SATISFACTION WITH THE INTERVENTIONS WAS HIGH. THE MEAN EFFECT SIZE FOR THE PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES WAS 0.35 WITH SOME OVER 0.50. THE MEAN EFFECT SIZE FOR SELF-REPORT OUTCOME MEASURES WAS 0.36. CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS INDICATE THAT IT IS FEASIBLE TO CONDUCT A LARGER RCT OF YOGA FOR SEDENTARY OLDER ADULTS AT RISK FOR MOBILITY PROBLEMS. THE YOGA AND COMPARISON INTERVENTIONS WERE SAFE, WELL ACCEPTED, AND WELL ATTENDED. EFFECT SIZES SUGGEST YOGA MAY HAVE IMPORTANT BENEFITS FOR THIS POPULATION AND SHOULD BE STUDIED FURTHER.

19 2508  59 YOGA BREATHING FOR CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY-ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE: RESULTS OF A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: MANY DEBILITATING SYMPTOMS ARISE FROM CANCER AND ITS TREATMENT THAT ARE OFTEN UNRELIEVED BY ESTABLISHED METHODS. PRANAYAMA, A SERIES OF YOGIC BREATHING TECHNIQUES, MAY IMPROVE CANCER-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE, BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED FOR THIS PURPOSE. OBJECTIVES: A PILOT STUDY WAS PERFORMED TO EVALUATE FEASIBILITY AND TO TEST THE EFFECTS OF PRANAYAMA ON CANCER-ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE. DESIGN: THIS WAS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL COMPARING PRANAYAMA TO USUAL CARE. SETTING: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT A UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER. SUBJECTS: PATIENTS RECEIVING CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE PRANAYAMA IMMEDIATELY OR AFTER A WAITING PERIOD (CONTROL GROUP). INTERVENTIONS: THE PRANAYAMA INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF FOUR BREATHING TECHNIQUES TAUGHT IN WEEKLY CLASSES AND PRACTICED AT HOME. THE TREATMENT GROUP RECEIVED PRANAYAMA DURING TWO CONSECUTIVE CYCLES OF CHEMOTHERAPY. THE CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED USUAL CARE DURING THEIR FIRST CYCLE, AND RECEIVED PRANAYAMA DURING THEIR SECOND CYCLE OF CHEMOTHERAPY. OUTCOME MEASURES: FEASIBILITY, CANCER-ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS (FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, STRESS), AND QUALITY OF LIFE WERE THE OUTCOMES. RESULTS: CLASS ATTENDANCE WAS NEARLY 100% IN BOTH GROUPS. SIXTEEN (16) PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL INTENT-TO-TREAT ANALYSES. THE REPEATED-MEASURES ANALYSES DEMONSTRATED THAT ANY INCREASE IN PRANAYAMA DOSE, WITH DOSE MEASURED IN THE NUMBER OF HOURS PRACTICED IN CLASS OR AT HOME, RESULTED IN IMPROVED SYMPTOM AND QUALITY-OF-LIFE SCORES. SEVERAL OF THESE ASSOCIATIONS--SLEEP DISTURBANCE (P=0.04), ANXIETY (P=0.04), AND MENTAL QUALITY OF LIFE (P=0.05)--REACHED OR APPROACHED STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA BREATHING WAS A FEASIBLE INTERVENTION AMONG PATIENTS WITH CANCER RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY. PRANAYAMA MAY IMPROVE SLEEP DISTURBANCE, ANXIETY, AND MENTAL QUALITY OF LIFE. A DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP WAS FOUND BETWEEN PRANAYAMA USE AND IMPROVEMENTS IN CHEMOTHERAPY-ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE. THESE FINDINGS NEED TO BE CONFIRMED IN A LARGER STUDY.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
20 2132  40 THE EFFECTS OF A GENTLE YOGA PROGRAM ON SLEEP, MOOD, AND BLOOD PRESSURE IN OLDER WOMEN WITH RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS): A PRELIMINARY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE. TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA VERSUS AN EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM ON SLEEP, MOOD, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND SYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION IN OLDER WOMEN WITH RLS. METHODS. PARTICIPANTS WERE DRAWN FROM A LARGER TRIAL REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK PROFILES IN OVERWEIGHT, SEDENTARY POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. SEVENTY-FIVE WOMEN WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE EITHER AN 8-WEEK YOGA (N = 38) OR EDUCATIONAL FILM (N = 37) PROGRAM. ALL 75 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED AN RLS SCREENING QUESTIONNAIRE. THE 20 WOMEN WHO MET ALL FOUR DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR RLS (N = 10 YOGA, 10 FILM GROUP) COMPRISED THE POPULATION FOR THIS NESTED STUDY. MAIN OUTCOMES ASSESSED PRE- AND POST-TREATMENT INCLUDED: SLEEP (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX), STRESS (PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE), MOOD (PROFILE OF MOOD STATES, STATE-TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY), BLOOD PRESSURE, AND HEART RATE. RESULTS.

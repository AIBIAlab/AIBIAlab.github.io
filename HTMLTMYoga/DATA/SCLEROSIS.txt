2 2300 43 THERAPEUTIC YOGA: SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) IS THE MOST COMMON AUTOIMMUNE INFLAMMATORY DEMYELINATING DISEASE OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM, AFFECTING OVER 2.3 MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE, THE AGE OF DISEASE ONSET IS TYPICALLY BETWEEN 20 AND 40 YEARS, WITH A HIGHER INCIDENCE IN WOMEN. INDIVIDUALS WITH MS EXPERIENCE A WIDE RANGE OF SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING DECLINING PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS (E.G., FATIGUE, IMBALANCE, SPASTICITY, CHRONIC PAIN, COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, BLADDER AND BOWEL DYSFUNCTION, VISUAL AND SPEECH IMPAIRMENTS, DEPRESSION, SENSORY DISTURBANCE, AND MOBILITY IMPAIRMENT). TO DATE, BOTH THE CAUSE OF AND CURE FOR MS REMAIN UNKNOWN. IN RECENT YEARS, MORE INDIVIDUALS WITH MS HAVE BEEN PURSUING ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF TREATMENT TO MANAGE SYMPTOMS OF THE DISEASE, INCLUDING MIND-BODY THERAPIES SUCH AS YOGA, MEDITATION, BREATHING, AND RELAXATION TECHNIQUES. IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT THE PRACTICE OF YOGA MAY BE A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE WAY OF MANAGING SYMPTOMS OF MS. THEREFORE, THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO SUMMARIZE THE MOST RELEVANT LITERATURE ON EXERCISE AND MIND-BODY MODALITIES TO TREAT MS SYMPTOMS AND, MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE BENEFITS AND POTENTIAL ROLE OF YOGA AS AN ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT OF SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH MS.

4 1454 28 INFLUENCE OF SPORTS CLIMBING AND YOGA ON SPASTICITY, COGNITIVE FUNCTION, MOOD AND FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. OBJECTIVES: SPASTICITY, COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, DEPRESSION AND FATIGUE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) PATIENTS. TO FIND OUT WHETHER NONPHARMALOGICAL TREATMENT APPROACHES CAN REDUCE THESE SYMPTOMS WE INVESTIGATED EFFECTS OF SPORTS CLIMBING (SC) AND YOGA ON SPASTICITY, COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, MOOD CHANGE AND FATIGUE IN MS PATIENTS. SPORTS CLIMBING (SC) AND YOGA ARE AEROBIC PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES COMPRISED A SERIES OF STRETCHING TECHNIQUES, IMPLEMENTATION OF WHICH DEMANDS BODY CONTROL AND PLANNING OF COMPLEX MOVEMENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 20 SUBJECTS WITH RELAPSING-REMITTING OR PROGRESSIVE MS, 26-50 YEARS OF AGE, WITH EDSS<OR=6 AND EDSS PYRAMIDAL FUNCTIONS SCORE (EDSSPYR)>2 WERE ENROLLED IN A RANDOMIZED PROSPECTIVE STUDY. THE PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO SC AND YOGA GROUP. WE EVALUATED SPASTICITY, COGNITIVE FUNCTION, MOOD AND FATIGUE BEFORE AND AFTER BOTH PROGRAMS, THAT LASTED 10 WEEKS, WITH STANDARDIZED ASSESSMENT METHODS. RESULTS: THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN SPASTICITY AFTER SC AND YOGA. IN THE SC GROUP WE FOUND A 25% REDUCTION (P=0.046) IN EDSSPYR. THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES IN EXECUTIVE FUNCTION AFTER THE COMPLETION OF BOTH PROGRAMS. THERE WAS A 17% INCREASE IN SELECTIVE ATTENTION PERFORMANCE AFTER YOGA (P=0.005). SC REDUCED FATIGUE FOR 32.5% (P=0.015), WHILE YOGA HAD NO EFFECT. WE FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT OF SC AND YOGA ON MOOD. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA AND SC MIGHT IMPROVE SOME OF THE MS SYMPTOMS AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE FUTURE AS POSSIBLE COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENTS.	2010

THE SUBJECTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED INTO THE TEST GROUP (12 PATIENTS) AND THE CONTROL GROUP (12 PATIENTS). MS QUALITY OF LIFE-54 (MSQOL-54) AND FATIGUE SEVERITY SCALE (FSS) WERE USED FOR DATA COLLECTION. SUBJECTS IN THE TEST GROUP UNDERWENT A MBSR AND CONSCIOUS YOGA PROGRAM IN 8 TWO-HOUR SESSIONS. THE DATA WERE ANALYZED USING THE SPSS VER.13 SOFTWARE. RESULTS: THE STUDY FINDINGS SHOWED THAT THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SUBJECTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUPS IN TERMS OF MEAN SCORE OF SOME SUBSCALES OF QUALITY OF LIFE INCLUDING PHYSICAL HEALTH, ROLE LIMITATIONS DUE TO PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS, ENERGY, EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING, HEALTH DISTRESS, HEALTH PERCEPTION, AND SATISFACTION WITH SEXUAL FUNCTION, OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE, AND FATIGUE SEVERITY. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PROGRAM IS EFFECTIVE IN REDUCTION OF FATIGUE SEVERITY AND IMPROVING SOME SUBSCALES OF QUALITY OF LIFE IN MS PATIENTS. HENCE, THIS SUPPORTIVE METHOD CAN BE USED AS AN EFFECTIVE WAY FOR IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE AND RELIEVING FATIGUE IN MS PATIENTS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
6 2079 30 THE EFFECT OF EXERCISE, YOGA AND PHYSIOTHERAPY ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF PEOPLE WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. INTRODUCTION: MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) IS A CHRONIC AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE AFFECTING THE MYELINATED AXONS OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM CAUSING NEUROLOGICAL DETERIORATION. PEOPLE LIVING WITH MS HAVE A POOR QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) BECAUSE OF THE SYMPTOMS CAUSED BY THE DISEASE AND THERE ARE VARIOUS TYPES OF TREATMENTS TO MANAGE THE SYMPTOMS ASIDE FROM MEDICATION. OBJECTIVE: THIS META-ANALYSIS EXAMINES THE EFFECT OF EXERCISE, YOGA AND PHYSIOTHERAPY ON THE PHYSICAL, MENTAL AND SOCIAL QOL AMONG INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MS. SETTING: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WITH META-ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED USING PUBMED, MEDLINE, AND SCOPUS FROM 1990 TO 2017. THE STANDARD MEAN DIFFERENCE SCORES WERE COMPUTED IN EACH STUDY FOR THE DOMAINS OF PHYSICAL, MENTAL AND SOCIAL FUNCTIONING. RESULTS: EIGHTEEN STUDIES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR THIS META-ANALYSIS. AEROBIC EXERCISE WAS EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING SATISFACTION WITH PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING,D = 0.35 (95% CI = 0.08 TO 0.62), MENTAL FUNCTIONING D = 0.42 (95% CI = 0.11 TO 0.72), AND SOCIAL FUNCTIONING D = 0.42 (95% CI = 0.15 TO 0.69). PHYSIOTHERAPY WAS ALSO FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING D = 0.50 (95% CI 0.19 TO 0.80), MENTAL FUNCTIONING D = 0.44 (95% CI 0.14 TO 0.75) AND SOCIAL FUNCTIONING D = 0.60 (95% CI 0.21 TO 0.90). HOWEVER YOGA AND COMBINATION OF EXERCISES DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON ANY OF THE QOL DOMAINS. CONCLUSION: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT AEROBIC EXERCISE AND PHYSIOTHERAPY IMPROVES THE SATISFACTION OF MS PATIENTS WITH THEIR PHYSICAL, MENTAL AND SOCIAL FUNCTIONING AND MAY BE INCLUDED AS NORMAL PRACTICE IN THE TREATMENT OF MS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
7 1584 25 MEDICAL THERAPEUTIC YOGA FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: EXAMINING SELF-EFFICACY FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, MOTIVATION FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES. PURPOSE: MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) IS AN INCURABLE NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE THAT RESULTS IN DEFICITS IN PHYSICAL AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION, AND OFTEN FOSTERS LOW LEVELS OF SELF-EFFICACY FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, MOTIVATION FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE [1]. DRUG THERAPIES, PHYSICAL THERAPY REHABILITATION, AND LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS SUCH AS INCREASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ARE STANDARD PROTOCOL FOR SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT, YET PERSONS WITH MS TEND TO BE PHYSICALLY INACTIVE [2,3]. ADDITIONALLY, SINGLE-MODALITY INTERVENTIONS DO NOT INHERENTLY ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES FACED CONCURRENTLY BY INDIVIDUALS WITH MS [4,5]. METHODS: THIS PROJECT EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF A 5-WEEK HOLISTIC BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL MEDICAL THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM ON PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEHAVIOR OUTCOMES IN INDIVIDUALS DIAGNOSED WITH MS. A MIXED-METHODS APPROACH WAS USED TO EXAMINE SELF-EFFICACY FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, MOTIVATION FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES IN 15 PARTICIPANTS. RESULTS: QUANTITATIVE MEASURES DEMONSTRATED INCREASED SELF-EFFICACY (T(14) = -2.23, P = 0.042), AND EMOTIONAL QUALITY OF LIFE (T(14) = -2.66, P = 0.019). RESPONSES TO AN OPEN-ENDED WRITTEN QUESTIONNAIRE AND FOLLOW-UP INTERVIEWS INDICATED OVERALL POSITIVE RESPONSE TO THE PROGRAM INCLUDING INCREASES IN SELF-EFFICACY FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, MOTIVATION FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. THESE RESULTS MAY HELP FUTURE HOLISTIC PROGRAMMING FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH MS INCORPORATE BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS WITH THERAPEUTIC REHABILITATION TO INCREASE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ADHERENCE.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONMULTIPLE SCLEROSIS IS A NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE IMPACTING PHYSICAL AND COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING THAT MAY BE MANAGED WITH A COMBINATION OF DRUG THERAPIES, REHABILITATION, AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY.INDIVIDUALS DIAGNOSED WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS TEND TO BE PHYSICALLY INACTIVE AND PHYSICAL INACTIVITY IS A CHALLENGE FOR OPTIMAL DISEASE MANAGEMENT.MEDICAL THERAPEUTIC YOGA OFFERS AN INTERDISCIPLINARY BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL FRAMEWORK TO SIMULTANEOUSLY ADDRESS THE BEHAVIORAL CHALLENGES AND PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENTS FACING INDIVIDUALS DIAGNOSED WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS.HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS SHOULD CONSIDER DEVELOPING PROGRAMS THAT USE A BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL FRAMEWORK TO AID IN DEVELOPING LONG-TERM ADHERENCE IN HEALTH BEHAVIORS SUCH AS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PARTICIPATION.	2022	

8 2780 32 YOGA THERAPY AND AMBULATORY MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS ASSESSMENT OF GAIT ANALYSIS PARAMETERS, FATIGUE AND BALANCE. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: GAIT IMPAIRMENT, FALLS DUE TO BALANCE PROBLEMS AND FATIGUE ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPLAINTS IN PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) AND CAUSE SIGNIFICANT FUNCTIONAL LIMITATION. USE OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE (CAM) TO HELP SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT AND TO IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE IS GROWING AMONG MS PATIENTS. YOGA IS WIDELY USED AS ONE OF THESE CAM INTERVENTIONS, HOWEVER, THE NUMBER OF STUDIES THAT SHOW THE EFFICACY OF YOGA TRAINING IN MS IS INADEQUATE. IN THIS STUDY, WE AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF A SHORT TERM YOGA PROGRAM ON FATIGUE, BALANCE AND GAIT IN PATIENTS WITH MS. METHOD: EIGHT VOLUNTEER AMBULATORY MS PATIENTS WITH CLINICALLY DEFINITE RELAPSING REMITTING MS WHOSE EXPANDED DISABILITY STATUS SCORE (EDSS) IS LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 6.0, AND EIGHT HEALTHY SUBJECTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. PATIENTS PARTICIPATED IN 12 WEEKS OF A BI-WEEKLY YOGA PROGRAM UNDER SUPERVISION. AT THEIR BASELINE AND AFTER YOGA THERAPY, THE FATIGUE SEVERITY SCALE (FSS) AND BERG BALANCE SCALE (BBS) ARE USED TO ASSESS FATIGUE AND BALANCE. THREE DIMENSIONAL GAIT ANALYSIS IS DONE USING THE VICON 612 SYSTEM WITH SIX CAMERAS AND TWO BERTEC FORCE PLATES, BEFORE AND AFTER THERAPY. RESULTS: AFTER SHORT TERM YOGA THERAPY, STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENTS WERE OBTAINED IN FATIGUE, BALANCE, STEP LENGTH AND WALKING SPEED. ALTHOUGH SAGITTAL PLANE PELVIS AND HIP ANGLES, ANKLE PLANTAR FLEXOR MOMENT, POWERS GENERATED AT THE HIP AND ANKLE JOINTS AT THE PRE-SWING WERE IMPROVED, THE IMPROVEMENTS WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. CONCLUSION: YOGA THERAPY IS A SAFE AND BENEFICIAL INTERVENTION FOR IMPROVING FATIGUE, BALANCE AND SPATIOTEMPORAL GAIT PARAMETERS IN PATIENTS WITH MS. FURTHER STUDIES WITH A LARGER SAMPLE SIZE AND LONGER FOLLOW-UP WILL BE NEEDED TO EVALUATE THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
9  530 25 COMPARISON OF REGULAR AEROBIC AND YOGA ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. BACKGROUND: THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) IS CHARACTERIZED BY FATIGUE, MOTOR WEAKNESS, AND SPASTICITY, TO NAME A FEW. MS SYMPTOMS MAY LEAD TO PHYSICAL INACTIVITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF SECONDARY DISEASES. THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF REGULAR AEROBIC AND YOGA ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF PATIENTS WITH MS. METHODS: THE PRESENT QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON 90 PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC MS CHOSEN RANDOMLY AND DIVIDED INTO TWO TEST AND ONE CONTROL GROUPS. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING SPSS SOFTWARE (VERSION 11.5) THROUGH PAIRED T-TEST, ANOVA, AND TUKEY'S POST HOC. RESULTS: THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AMONG THE SCORES OF QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE THREE GROUPS PRIOR TO INVESTIGATION. ALTHOUGH THEY WERE SIGNIFICANT AFTER INTERVENTION. THE MEAN SCORE OF YOGA GROUP WAS HIGHER THAN THAT OF AEROBIC GROUP, AND AEROBIC GROUP SHOWED A HIGHER MEAN SCORE COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL. CONCLUSION: YOGA AND AEROBIC EXERCISES MAY IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH MS. IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT THE GOVERNOR ALONG WITH MS SOCIETIES AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS SERVICING AND SUPPORTING PATIENTS START TO DEVELOP SPORT-REGULATED PROGRAMS TO HELP IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THESE PATIENTS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
10 2150 20 THE EFFECTS OF PRANAYAMA, HATHA AND RAJA YOGA ON PHYSICAL PAIN AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF WOMEN WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. IN A CLINICAL TRIAL CARRIED OUT ON 60 WOMEN WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, THE RESEARCHERS OBTAINED DATA USING SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRES. IN ADDITION TO DEMOGRAPHIC DATA, THE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS QUALITY OF LIFE-54 (MSQOL-54) INSTRUMENT WAS USED TO DETERMINE HOW MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS INFLUENCES THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF THE STUDIED WOMEN. WITHIN THE FRAME OF THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, THE PARTICIPANTS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO EQUALLY SIZED GROUPS (THE CASE AND THE CONTROL GROUP) IN WHICH THE LEVEL OF PAIN AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE WERE EVALUATED. THE CASE GROUP EXERCISED PAIN-MANAGING YOGA METHODS FOR THREE MONTHS, KEEPING THE PACE OF EIGHT 90-MINUTE SESSIONS PER MONTH. THE CONTROL PARTICIPANTS WERE SUBJECTED TO NO INTERVENTION. ONE MONTH AFTER THE YOGA THERAPY, THE LEVEL OF PAIN AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE WERE EVALUATED IN BOTH GROUPS AND COMPARED TO THE BASELINE DATA. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING SPSS SOFTWARE AND PAIRED T-TESTS. AFTER THE YOGA THERAPY, THE CASE GROUP SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PHYSICAL PAIN MANAGEMENT (P=0.007) AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE (P=0.001) AS COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT YOGA TECHNIQUES CAN ALLEVIATE PHYSICAL PAIN AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PATIENTS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
11 2705 26 YOGA INTERVENTIONS USED FOR THE REHABILITATION OF STROKE, PARKINSON'S DISEASE, AND MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: A SCOPING REVIEW OF CLINICAL RESEARCH. OBJECTIVES: THE CURRENT BODY OF LITERATURE WAS REVIEWED TO COMPILE AND DESCRIBE YOGA INTERVENTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN APPLIED IN CLINICAL RESEARCH AND NEUROLOGIC REHABILITATION SETTINGS WITH PATIENTS AFFECTED BY STROKE, PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD), AND MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS). DESIGN: AVAILABLE LITERATURE ON YOGA THERAPY (YT) WAS MAPPED FOLLOWING A FIVE-STAGE FRAMEWORK TO IDENTIFY KEY CONCEPTS, KNOWLEDGE GAPS, AND EVIDENCE TO INFORM PRACTICE. PUBLICATIONS WERE IDENTIFIED THROUGH MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, AND PSYCINFO. SELECTED STUDIES REQUIRED SUBJECTS WITH A CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS OF STROKE, PD, AND MS TO PARTICIPATE IN A YOGA INTERVENTION AND HAVE PHYSICAL, COGNITIVE, AND/OR PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOME MEASURES ASSESSED. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 50 STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW. STUDY CHARACTERISTICS, PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS, DESCRIPTION OF THE YOGA INTERVENTION, REPORTED OUTCOME MEASURES AND THE MAIN FINDINGS WERE EXTRACTED FROM THE STUDIES. CONCLUSION: IMPLEMENTING YT IN NEUROREHABILITATION CAN HELP HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS INTEGRATE A MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH THAT ADDRESSES THE FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CHALLENGES OF LIVING WITH A CHRONIC AND DEBILITATING NEUROLOGIC DISORDER. THE INCLUDED STUDIES DESCRIBED YOGIC INTERVENTIONS CONSISTING OF GROUP OR INDIVIDUAL THERAPY SESSIONS LASTING 60-75 MIN THAT WERE CARRIED OUT ONE TO THREE TIMES PER WEEK FOR 8-12 CONSECUTIVE WEEKS ACROSS ALL THREE CONDITIONS. ALL STUDIES DESCRIBED IN THIS SCOPING REVIEW USED DIFFERENT YOGA PROTOCOLS CONFIRMING THE LACK OF SPECIFIC INTERVENTIONAL PARAMETERS AVAILABLE FOR IMPLEMENTING YOGA INTO THE REHABILITATION OF INDIVIDUALS AFFECTED BY STROKE, PD, OR MS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
12 2021 20 SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF YOGA AND BALANCE: EFFECT ON ADULTS WITH NEUROMUSCULAR IMPAIRMENT. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW EXAMINES THE EFFICACY OF YOGA AS A NEUROMUSCULAR INTERVENTION FOR COMMUNITY-DWELLING POPULATIONS AT RISK FOR FALLS TO DETERMINE ITS UTILITY FOR USE IN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY INTERVENTION. POPULATIONS INCLUDED OLDER ADULTS AND ADULTS WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI), CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (CVA), DEMENTIA AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD)-TYPE DEMENTIA, MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS), AND PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD). BENEFITS OF YOGA INCLUDE IMPROVED POSTURE CONTROL, IMPROVED FLEXIBILITY OF MIND AND BODY, RELAXATION, AND DECREASED ANXIETY AND STRESS. A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE WAS CONDUCTED TO UNDERSTAND THE SALUTARY BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR CLIENTS WHO ARE AT RISK FOR FALLS BECAUSE OF NEUROMUSCULAR ISSUES. MODERATE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE USE OF YOGA TO DECREASE THE RISK FOR FALLS FOR COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH CVA, DEMENTIA AND AD-TYPE DEMENTIA, AND MS. STUDIES INVOLVING PEOPLE WITH TBI AND PD DID NOT INCLUDE STRONG ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A CLEAR CLASSIFICATION.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
13 1456 26 INFLUENCE OF YOGA AND AEROBICS EXERCISE ON FATIGUE, PAIN AND PSYCHOSOCIAL STATUS IN PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: A RANDOMIZED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) IS AN AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE INVOLVING BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD. WEAKNESS, COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, PAIN, DEPRESSION AND FATIGUE, AS COMMON SYMPTOMS OF MS, MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT ON GENERAL HEALTH OF MS PATIENTS. THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE INFLUENCE OF YOGA AND AEROBIC EXERCISE ON FATIGUE, PAIN, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL STATUS AMONG THESE PATIENTS. METHODS: IN A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL STUDY ON 90 PATIENTS WHOM WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO THREE EQUAL GROUPS OF YOGA EXERCISES, AEROBICS EXERCISES, AND CONTROL GROUP. THE EXERCISE PROGRAM WAS PERFORMED AS THREE SESSIONS PER WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS. THE EXERCISE PROGRAM INCLUDED 40 MINUTES, INCLUDING 5-10 MINUTES FOR WARM-UP, 25-30 MINUTES OF EXERCISE (WALKING), AND 5 MINUTES FOR COOLING DOWN. YOGA EXERCISES WERE SCHEDULED THREE SESSIONS A WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS AS WELL. RESULTS: THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN FATIGUE, PAIN SEVERITY AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STATUS AMONG THREE GROUPS PRIOR TO THE STUDY, BUT AFTER THE STUDY, IN YOGA AND EXERCISE GROUPS, FATIGUE PHYSICAL FUNCTION, PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL ROLE WHICH PATIENTS PLAY THROUGHOUT DAILY LIFE, SOCIAL FUNCTION, ENERGY, MENTAL STATUS AND OVERALL HYGIENE INCREASED, AND THE PAIN AND FATIGUE WERE RELIEVED IN THE PATIENTS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA AND AEROBICS EXERCISE COULD DECREASE SOME OF THE MS SYMPTOMS, THERAPEUTIC COSTS, HOSPITAL STAY, AND DAYS LOST FROM WORK AS WELL AS INCREASING THE PATIENTS' EFFICIENCY.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
14  315 21 AN INDIVIDUALIZED YOGA PROGRAMME FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: A CASE STUDY. PURPOSE: DESPITE THE EVIDENCE THAT YOGA IS BENEFICIAL FOR PEOPLE WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS), SUBSTANTIAL IN-DEPTH QUALITATIVE STUDIES OF YOGA AND MS-AND INDIVIDUALIZED YOGA PROGRAMMES (IYP), IN PARTICULAR-ARE LACKING. THE AIMS OF THIS PAPER ARE (A) TO CONDUCT A CASE STUDY ON AN IYP FOR ONE PARTICIPANT WITH MS IN TERMS OF HER EXPERIENCE OF YOGA AND HOW YOGA AFFECTED HER PARTICULAR SYMPTOMS OF MS, AND (B) TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE UNIQUE AND CHANGING NEEDS OF SOMEONE WITH MS IN THE CONTEXT OF AN IYP. DESIGN AND METHOD: DATA COLLECTED FOR THIS STUDY WERE SOURCED FROM A QUALITATIVE CASE STUDY DESIGN WITH DATA COLLECTED VIA A PARTICIPANT DIARY COMPLETED OVER THE 24-WEEK DURATION OF AN IYP; AN EXIT INTERVIEW AFTER THE FINAL IYP SESSION; AND WEEKLY RECORDS COMPLETED BY THE YOGA TEACHER. DATA WERE ANALYSED USING THEMATIC ANALYSIS. FINDINGS: OVER THE COURSE OF THE IYP, THE FEMALE PARTICIPANT EXPERIENCED AN INCREASED AWARENESS OF NEGATIVE THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS ABOUT MS AND HOW IT AFFECTED HER AND HER BODY. AS THE PROGRAMME PROGRESSED, SHE BEGAN TO WORK THROUGH THESE FEELINGS AND, BY THE END OF THE PROGRAMME, REPORTED EXPERIENCING IMPROVEMENTS IN MUSCLE TONE, STRENGTH, BALANCE, PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING, AND CONFIDENCE. CONCLUSION: OUR FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF A PROGRAMME INDIVIDUALIZED TO MEET THE COMPLEX HEALTH AND PSYCHOLOGICAL NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH MS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
15  947 23 EFFECTS OF A 4-MONTH ANANDA YOGA PROGRAM ON PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR PERSONS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. OBJECTIVES: YOGA HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR ADDRESSING PROBLEMS WITH STRENGTH, FLEXIBILITY, BALANCE, GAIT, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND CONCENTRATION. VARYING DEGREES OF THESE PROBLEMS OCCUR IN INDIVIDUALS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS). THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF A COMPREHENSIVE, 4-MONTH YOGA PROGRAM ON STRENGTH, MOBILITY, BALANCE, RESPIRATORY FUNCTION, AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH MS. METHODS: TWENTY FOUR INDIVIDUALS WITH MS PARTICIPATED IN AN INTENSIVE ANANDA YOGA TRAINING FOLLOWED BY 17 WEEKS OF HOME PRACTICE. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN FUNCTIONAL STRENGTH, BALANCE, AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW AND A TREND TOWARD IMPROVEMENTS IN MENTAL HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES WERE DETECTED FOLLOWING THE INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS OF THIS EXPLORATORY STUDY SUGGEST THAT YOGA CAN HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PERSONS WITH MILD TO MODERATE MS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
16 1236 21 FEASIBILITY OF A 6-MONTH YOGA PROGRAM TO IMPROVE THE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL STATUS OF PERSONS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. CONTEXT: TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, THERE HAS BEEN NO STUDY ON YOGA THAT INCLUDES BOTH PERSONS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. BECAUSE YOGA HAS THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS IN BOTH PERSONS WITH MS AND HEALTHY PERSONS, WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT IT WOULD BE AN EFFECTIVE METHOD TO IMPROVE NOT ONLY THE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL STATUS BUT ALSO THE TIME PERSONS WITH MS AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS SPEND TOGETHER. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF A 6-MONTH (LONG-TERM) YOGA PROGRAM TO IMPROVE THE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL STATUS OF PERSONS WITH MS AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. DESIGN: UNCONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL. SETTING: THE PROTOCOL WAS DEVELOPED AT THE DEPARTMENT OF NEUROLOGY, FACULTY OF MEDICINE, AND SCHOOL OF PHYSICAL THERAPY AND REHABILITATION, DOKUZ EYLUL UNIVERSITY, IZMIR, TURKEY. PARTICIPANTS: PERSONS WITH MS AND HEALTHY FAMILY MEMBERS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: WALKING, BALANCE, FATIGUE, HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, DEPRESSION, PAIN, AND KINESIOPHOBIA. INTERVENTIONS: YOGA TRAINING WAS GIVEN ONCE A WEEK (AT LEAST 1H) FOR 6 MONTHS. THE SAME ASSESSORS WHO ASSESSED AT BASELINE ALSO PERFORMED THE SAME ASSESSMENTS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE END OF THE TRAINING (I.E., AFTER 6 MONTHS). RESULTS: IN TOTAL, 44 PARTICIPANTS (27 PERSONS WITH MS AND 17 HEALTHY FAMILY MEMBERS) PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY. TWELVE PERSONS WITH MS AND THREE HEALTHY FAMILY MEMBERS COMPLETED THE 6-MONTH YOGA INTERVENTION. THE COMPLETION RATE FOR PERSONS WITH MS AND HEALTHY SUBJECTS WAS 44.4% AND 17.6%, RESPECTIVELY. IN PERSONS WITH MS, THE MENTAL DIMENSION OF HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, WALKING SPEED, FATIGUE, AND DEPRESSION LEVELS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED AFTER THE YOGA PROGRAM (P < .05). HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE SELF-REPORTED WALKING IMPACT, BALANCE, PAIN, PHYSICAL DIMENSION OF HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, AND KINESIOPHOBIA LEVELS IN THE PERSONS WITH MS (P > .05). THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT A 6-MONTH YOGA PROGRAM CAN IMPROVE THE MENTAL DIMENSION OF HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, WALKING SPEED, FATIGUE, AND DEPRESSION IN THE PERSONS WITH MS. HOWEVER, THE 6-MONTH YOGA PROGRAM DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A FEASIBLE METHOD TO INCREASE THE TIME THAT PERSONS WITH MS SPEND TOGETHER WITH THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS.	2018	
                                                                                           
17 2597 24 YOGA FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. WHILE YOGA SEEMS TO BE EFFECTIVE IN A NUMBER OF NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS, THE EVIDENCE OF EFFICACY IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS REMAINS UNCLEAR. THE AIM OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO SYSTEMATICALLY ASSESS AND META-ANALYZE THE AVAILABLE DATA ON EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS, PSYCINFO, CAM-QUEST, CAMBASE, AND INDMED WERE SEARCHED THROUGH MARCH 2014. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) OF YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS WERE INCLUDED IF THEY ASSESSED HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, FATIGUE, AND/OR MOBILITY. MOOD, COGNITIVE FUNCTION, AND SAFETY WERE DEFINED AS SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES. RISK OF BIAS WAS ASSESSED USING THE COCHRANE TOOL. SEVEN RCTS WITH A TOTAL OF 670 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED. EVIDENCE FOR SHORT-TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA COMPARED TO USUAL CARE WERE FOUND FOR FATIGUE (STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE [SMD] = -0.52; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CI) = -1.02 TO -0.02; P = 0.04; HETEROGENEITY: I2 = 60%; CHI2 = 7.43; P = 0.06) AND MOOD (SMD = -0.55; 95%CI = -0.96 TO -0.13; P = 0.01; HETEROGENEITY: I2 = 0%; CHI2 = 1.25; P = 0.53), BUT NOT FOR HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, MUSCLE FUNCTION, OR COGNITIVE FUNCTION. THE EFFECTS ON FATIGUE AND MOOD WERE NOT ROBUST AGAINST BIAS. NO SHORT-TERM OR LONGER TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA COMPARED TO EXERCISE WERE FOUND. YOGA WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS. IN CONCLUSION, SINCE NO METHODOLOGICAL SOUND EVIDENCE WAS FOUND, NO RECOMMENDATION CAN BE MADE REGARDING YOGA AS A ROUTINE INTERVENTION FOR PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. YOGA MIGHT BE CONSIDERED A TREATMENT OPTION FOR PATIENTS WHO ARE NOT ADHERENT TO RECOMMENDED EXERCISE REGIMENS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
18  826 25 EFFECT OF YOGA ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVE: INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) IN PATIENTS WITH CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS. METHODS: A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED ON THE PUBMED-NCBI, EBSCO HOST, COCHRANE LIBRARY, SCOPUS AND SCIENCEDIRECT DATABASES UNTIL 05 APRIL 2021. ONLY RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH OR FRENCH WERE INCLUDED AND HAD TO COMPARE YOGA TO ANOTHER INTERVENTION GROUP OR A CONTROL GROUP. THEY ALSO HAD TO CLEARLY MEASURE HRQOL. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY WAS ASSESSED WITH THE REVISED COCHRANE RISK-OF-BIAS TOOL FOR RANDOMIZED TRIALS AND THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE WAS EVALUATED USING THE GRADING OF RECOMMENDATIONS ASSESSMENT, DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION (GRADE) CRITERIA. RESULTS: SIXTEEN STUDIES WERE FOUND, INCLUDING SIX FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, FIVE FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE, TWO FOR STROKE, ONE FOR DEMENTIA, ONE FOR EPILEPSY AND ONE FOR BRAIN TUMOUR. ONLY 12 STUDIES PERFORMED BETWEEN-GROUP STATISTICS AND 8 FOUND A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS AFTER TREATMENT. WHEN YOGA WAS COMPARED TO NO INTERVENTION, THE RESULTS WERE GENERALLY IN FAVOUR OF THE YOGA GROUP, BUT WHEN YOGA WAS COMPARED TO ANOTHER INTERVENTION PROGRAMME, THERE WAS GENERALLY NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS. THERE WERE MANY DIFFERENT HRQOL QUESTIONNAIRES, EVEN WITHIN THE SAME DISEASE, WHICH REDUCES THE COMPARABILITY OF STUDIES. CONCLUSIONS: WITH LOW TO MODERATE QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE, YOGA SEEMS EFFECTIVE TO IMPROVE HRQOL IN PEOPLE WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE. FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, STROKE, DEMENTIA, EPILEPSY AND BRAIN TUMOUR, THE QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE IS STILL INSUFFICIENT TO CONCLUDE OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
19 2815 23 YOGA TRAINING HAS POSITIVE EFFECTS ON POSTURAL BALANCE AND ITS INFLUENCE ON ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING IN PEOPLE WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: A PILOT STUDY. CONTEXT: THERE IS A LITTLE EVIDENCE ABOUT THE INFLUENCE OF YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR POSTURAL BALANCE AND ITS INFLUENCE ON ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) PATIENTS. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE INFLUENCE OF A SIX-MONTH YOGA PROGRAM ON POSTURAL BALANCE AND SUBJECTIVE IMPACT OF POSTURAL BALANCE IMPAIRMENT ON ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING IN PEOPLE WITH MS. DESIGN: RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY. SETTING: PROTOCOL DEVELOPED AT THE ADAPTIVE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY STUDY DEPARTMENT, COLLEGE OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION, STATE UNIVERSITY OF CAMPINAS, BRAZIL. SUBJECTS: A TOTAL OF 12 (11 WOMEN) YOGA NAIVE PEOPLE WITH MS RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS AS FOLLOWS: CONTROL (C-WAITING LIST, N = 6) AND YOGA (Y-YOGA TRAINING, N = 6). INTERVENTIONS: YOGA GROUP PRACTICED POSTURES, BREATHING EXERCISES, MEDITATION, AND RELAXATION ON WEEKLY 60-MIN CLASSES FOR A SIX-MONTH PERIOD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: THE FOLLOWING EVALUATIONS WERE PERFORMED AT STUDY ENTRY (BASELINE), AND AFTER SIX MONTHS (SIX MONTHS): BERG BALANCE SCALE (BBS), EXPANDED DISABILITY STATUS SCALE (EDSS), AND SELF-REPORTED POSTURAL BALANCE QUALITY AND INFLUENCE OF POSTURAL BALANCE ON ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN BBS SCORE FROM BASELINE TO SIX MONTHS ONLY IN THE YOGA GROUP, ESPECIALLY IN SUBJECTS WITH HIGHER EDSS SCORE, WITH INCREASED QUALITY OF SELF-REPORTED POSTURAL BALANCE, AND DECREASED INFLUENCE OF POSTURAL BALANCE IMPAIRMENT ON ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING. IN CONCLUSION, A SIX-MONTH YOGA TRAINING IS BENEFICIAL FOR PEOPLE WITH MS, SINCE IT IMPROVES POSTURAL BALANCE AND DECREASES THE INFLUENCE OF POSTURAL BALANCE IMPAIRMENT ON ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING. A GREATER SAMPLE SIZE IS NECESSARY TO INCREASE GENERALIZATION, BUT IT SEEMS THAT YOGA COULD BE INCLUDED AS A FEASIBLE COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR PEOPLE WITH MS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
20 2767 22 YOGA PROVISION FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: IS THE FUTURE ONLINE? BACKGROUND: YOGA HAS MULTIPLE BENEFITS FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS), INCLUDING REDUCED PAIN, DEPRESSION, FATIGUE, STRENGTH, AND IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE. DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, HOME-BASED DELIVERY OF YOGA INCREASED. HOWEVER, NO STUDIES TO DATE HAVE EXPLORED ONLINE HOME-BASED YOGA FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MS, MORE SPECIFICALLY THE MOTIVATIONS, EXPERIENCES, OR THE SUSTAINABILITY OF HOME-BASED YOGA PRACTICE FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MS. AIM: THIS STUDY AIMED TO EXPLORE THE FACILITATORS AND BARRIERS OF ONLINE YOGA PROVISION FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MS. METHODS: ONE FOCUS GROUP AND THREE SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE CARRIED OUT ONLINE VIA ZOOM WITH ONE YOGA INSTRUCTOR AND SEVEN YOGA PARTICIPANTS LIVING WITH MS. THEMATIC ANALYSIS WAS USED TO ANALYSE THIS DATA. FINDINGS: TWO THEMES WERE GENERATED FROM THE INTERVIEWS, THE ENVIRONMENT AND FUTURE PROVISION, EACH WITH THEIR OWN SUB-THEMES. THE THEMES REFLECT VARIOUS FACILITATORS AND BARRIERS OF HOME-BASED YOGA PROVISION WHICH DIFFERED DEPENDING UPON THE INDIVIDUALS HOME ENVIRONMENT, SOCIAL CONNECTIONS, PHYSICAL ABILITY, AND CONFIDENCE PRACTISING YOGA. FURTHERMORE, PREFERENCES OF HOME PROVISION FLUCTUATED OVER TIME DEPENDING UPON SYMPTOMS OF MS. CONCLUSIONS: HOME-BASED YOGA PRACTICE IS A VIABLE AND ENJOYABLE OPTION FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MS. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOGA STUDIOS OFFERING HOME-BASED YOGA PROVISION CONSIDER INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN PREFERENCE, AS WELL AS FLUCTUATIONS IN SYMPTOMS THAT MAY CREATE INEQUITABLE ACCESS TO SERVICES AND MAY PREVENT PARTICIPATION FOR SOME.	2022

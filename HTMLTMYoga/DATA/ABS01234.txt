1 1234 117 FEASIBILITY AND RESULTS OF A CASE STUDY OF YOGA TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING IN PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY. PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS MIXED-METHODS CASE STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER AN 8-WEEK 1:1 YOGA PROGRAM WAS FEASIBLE AND BENEFICIAL TO PEOPLE WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI). METHOD: THIS WAS A MIXED-METHODS CASE STUDY OF ONE-TO-ONE YOGA FOR PEOPLE WITH TBI INCLUDED THREE PEOPLE. WE COMPLETED ASSESSMENTS BEFORE AND AFTER THE 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION AND INCLUDED MEASURES OF BALANCE, BALANCE CONFIDENCE, PAIN, RANGE OF MOTION, STRENGTH AND MOBILITY. QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WERE INCLUDED AT THE POST-ASSESSMENT. WE INCLUDE A PERCENT CHANGE CALCULATION AND SALIENT QUOTES THAT REPRESENT THE PERCEIVED IMPACT OF THE YOGA INTERVENTION. RESULTS: ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE YOGA INTERVENTION AND ALL DEMONSTRATED IMPROVEMENTS IN PHYSICAL OUTCOME MEASURES. FOR THE GROUP, BALANCE INCREASED BY 36%, BALANCE CONFIDENCE BY 39%, LOWER EXTREMITY STRENGTH BY 100% AND ENDURANCE BY 105%. QUALITATIVE DATA SUPPORT THE USE OF YOGA TO IMPROVE MULTIPLE ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING, ONE PARTICIPANT STATED: "I MEAN IT'S ROCKED MY WORLD. IT'S CHANGED MY LIFE. I MEAN ALL THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS. I MEAN PHYSICALLY, EMOTIONALLY, MENTALLY, IT'S GIVEN ME YOU KNOW MY LIFE BACK...". CONCLUSIONS: YOGA, DELIVERED IN A ONE-TO-ONE SETTING, APPEARS TO BE FEASIBLE AND BENEFICIAL TO PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC TBI. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: CHRONIC TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI) LEADS TO MANY ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING IMPAIRMENT. YOGA DELIVERED IN A ONE-TO-ONE SETTING MAY BE FEASIBLE AND BENEFICIAL FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC TBI.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
2 1248  50 FEASIBILITY OF YOGA TO IMPROVE SYMPTOMS IN INDIVIDUALS WITH SEVERE, CHRONIC TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY: A MIXED-METHODS CASE SERIES. CONTEXT: PEOPLE WITH SEVERE TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI) EXPERIENCE LIFELONG SEQUELAE THAT AFFECT PHYSICAL, COGNITIVE, AND MENTAL HEALTH. IN OTHER POPULATIONS, YOGA HAS SHOWN POTENTIAL TO ALLEVIATE INSOMNIA, PAIN, AND DEPRESSION AND TO IMPROVE COGNITION. OBJECTIVE: THE STUDY INTENDED TO INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF A SIX-WEEK, GROUP-YOGA INTERVENTION FOR ADULTS WITH SEVERE CHRONIC TBI, FOCUSING ON SLEEP, PAIN, MOOD, AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION. DESIGN: THE RESEARCH TEAM PERFORMED A FEASIBILITY STUDY USING A MIXED-METHODS, CASE-SERIES DESIGN. SETTING: THE STUDY RECRUITED PARTICIPANTS BY DISTRIBUTING FLYERS TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND TBI SUPPORT GROUPS. PARTICIPANTS: PARTICIPANTS WERE TWO PEOPLE WITH SEVERE, CHRONIC, TBI. INTERVENTION: THE INTERVENTION WAS A SIX-WEEK COURSE OF GROUP YOGA, WITH 70-MINUTE CLASSES TWICE A WEEK. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE STUDY ASSESSED OUTCOMES AT BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION USING VALIDATED MEASURES TO ASSESS EXECUTIVE FUNCTION, MOOD, SLEEP, AND PAIN: THE BEHAVIOR RATING INVENTORY OF EXECUTIVE FUNCTION-ADULT VERSION (BRIEF-A), BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY (BDI), PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI), AND NEUROPATHIC PAIN SCALE (NPS). A SEMISTRUCTURED INTERVIEW WAS CONDUCTED DURING THE WEEK POSTINTERVENTION TO OBTAIN QUALITATIVE DATA. RESULTS: THE STUDY HAD A 100% RETENTION RATE, A 91.67% ATTENDANCE RATE, AND HIGH SATISFACTION. ONE PARTICIPANT DEMONSTRATED IMPROVEMENT IN ALL OUTCOMES, WHILE THE OTHER SHOWED MIXED RESULTS. DEPRESSION SHOWED THE MOST CONSISTENT IMPROVEMENT, 47.2% ON AVERAGE. FOR INSOMNIA, ONE PARTICIPANT SHOWED IMPROVED SLEEP AT 14.29%. THE QUALITATIVE DATA DEMONSTRATED POSITIVE CHANGES IN COGNITION, MOOD, SLEEP, AND PAIN. CONCLUSIONS: A SIX-WEEK GROUP YOGA INTERVENTION IS FEASIBLE AND APPEARS TO BE BENEFICIAL IN ALLEVIATING SYMPTOMS, ESPECIALLY DEPRESSION AND INSOMNIA, IN PEOPLE WITH SEVERE CHRONIC TBI. A LONGER INTERVENTION PERIOD WAS SUGGESTED BY THE PARTICIPANTS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                            
3 1958  35 SELF-MANAGEMENT AND YOGA FOR OLDER ADULTS WITH CHRONIC STROKE: A MIXED-METHODS STUDY OF PHYSICAL FITNESS AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED CHANGES IN PHYSICAL FITNESS AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AMONG OLDER PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC STROKE (STROKE >/= 6 MONTHS PREVIOUS) AFTER PARTICIPATION IN A YOGA INFUSED SELF-MANAGEMENT INTERVENTION. METHODS: A MIXED-METHODS SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS EXAMINED QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF ENDURANCE, STRENGTH, AND GAIT SPEED AND QUALITATIVE PERSPECTIVES OF INTERVENTION PARTICIPANTS. RESULTS: BASED ON WILCOXON ANALYSIS, PHYSICAL FITNESS OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDING ENDURANCE AND LOWER AND UPPER BODY STRENGTH SIGNIFICANTLY (P < .02) IMPROVED. BASED ON QUALITATIVE RESULTS OF 2 FOCUS GROUPS AND 14 INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS, PARTICIPANTS EXPRESSED POSITIVE CHANGES IN ENDURANCE, STRENGTH, GAIT SPEED, FLEXIBILITY, AND BALANCE. THEY ALSO REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN WALKING ABILITY AND DURATION, AND EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO CONTINUE YOGA AND INCREASE LEVELS OF EXERCISE. CONCLUSIONS: WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF IMPROVING PHYSICAL FITNESS AND EXERCISE FOR OLDER ADULTS WITH CHRONIC STROKE, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR SELF-MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS TO PROVIDE SPECIFIC SAFE AND FEASIBLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY COMPONENTS, SUCH AS YOGA. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: HEALTH PROFESSIONALS MAY IMPROVE OFFERED CHRONIC STROKE SELF-MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS BY INCORPORATING YOGA.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
4 2249  34 THE LIVED EXPERIENCE AND PATIENT-REPORTED BENEFITS OF YOGA PARTICIPATION IN AN INPATIENT BRAIN INJURY REHABILITATION SETTING. CONTEXT: THE MULTIFACTORIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA HAVE BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED IN THE LITERATURE, WITH THE INTEGRATION OF YOGA THERAPY INTO HEALTHCARE BEING AN EMERGING FIELD. IN GENERAL, YOGA THERAPY PROGRAMS ARE UTILIZED IN THE COMMUNITY AS AN ADJUNCT TO OTHER THERAPY. AT PRESENT, LIMITED REHABILITATION UNITS ROUTINELY INCORPORATE INTEGRATIVE THERAPY OPTIONS WITHIN A HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT. AIMS: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXPLORE THE LIVED EXPERIENCE AND PATIENT-REPORTED BENEFITS OF YOGA IN AN INPATIENT BRAIN INJURY REHABILITATION SETTING. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: THIRTY-ONE PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED TO THE STUDY AFTER VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATING IN A YOGA CLASS WITHIN AN INPATIENT BRAIN INJURY REHABILITATION UNIT OF A MAJOR METROPOLITAN HOSPITAL. YOGA SESSIONS WERE HELD WEEKLY FOR 60 MIN AND CONSISTED OF A MODIFIED HATHA YOGA STYLE. THIS WAS A MIXED-METHODS, QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL ONE-GROUP PRETEST-POSTTEST STUDY. METHODOLOGY: QUANTITATIVE DATA WERE COLLECTED TO MEASURE PERCEPTIONS OF RELAXATION AND WELL-BEING BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA CLASSES, ALONG WITH THE SATISFACTION OF THE CLASS. SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE UTILIZED TO COLLECT QUALITATIVE DATA OF EXPERIENCES AND PERCEPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA PARTICIPATION. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: THEMATIC ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETED FOR QUALITATIVE DATA. QUANTITATIVE DATA WERE ANALYZED USING NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICAL METHODS, AND DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS WERE ALSO PROVIDED. RESULTS: THE BENEFITS DESCRIBED BY PARTICIPANTS ARE REPORTED IN THIS PAPER. THESE INCLUDE IMPROVED RELAXATION, PHYSICAL WELL-BEING, EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING, BEING PRESENT, AND SELF-AWARENESS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY DESCRIBES THE PERSONAL BENEFITS EXPERIENCED FROM REGULAR YOGA PARTICIPATION WITHIN AN INPATIENT REHABILITATION SETTING.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
5   87  35 A MIXED METHODS EVALUATION OF AN INDIVIDUALISED YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS: PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVES: TO EXPLORE PATIENTS' EXPERIENCES OF AN INDIVIDUALISED YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA), SPECIFICALLY IN TERMS OF ITS ACCEPTABILITY AND IMPACT ON PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES. DESIGN: TEN PATIENTS TOOK PART IN A 16 WEEK YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION IN A HOSPITAL SETTING, CONSISTING OF 10 ONE-TO-ONE CONSULTATIONS WITH A YOGA THERAPIST FOLLOWED BY TWO GROUP REVIEW SESSIONS. CHANGES IN HEALTH (EQ-5D, HADS) WERE ASSESSED PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION AND AT 12-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED POST-INTERVENTION AND ANALYSED USING THEMATIC ANALYSIS. RESULTS: ATTENDANCE OF THE 1-TO-1 SESSIONS WAS HIGH (98 %) AND ALL PARTICIPANTS REPORTED STRONG COMMITMENT TO THEIR PERSONALISED HOME PRACTICE. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN MEASURES OF DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, PAIN, QUALITY OF LIFE AND GENERAL HEALTH AT POST-INTERVENTION AND 12-MONTHS (P < 0.05). IN INTERVIEWS, ALL BUT ONE PARTICIPANT REPORTED POSITIVE CHANGES TO THEIR SYMPTOMS AND SEVERAL REPORTED REDUCTIONS IN THEIR MEDICATION AND BROADER BENEFITS SUCH AS IMPROVED SLEEP, MOOD AND ENERGY, ENABLING RE-ENGAGEMENT WITH LIFE. THE PERSONALLY TAILORED NATURE OF THE PRACTICE AND PERCEIVED BENEFITS WERE KEY MOTIVATIONAL FACTORS. PARTICULAR VALUE WAS PLACED ON THE THERAPEUTIC FUNCTION OF THE CONSULTATION AND PROVISION OF TOOLS TO MANAGE STRESS AND BUILD RESILIENCE. CONCLUSION: THIS YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION WAS POSITIVELY RECEIVED BY PATIENTS WITH RA, WITH HIGH LEVELS OF ADHERENCE TO BOTH THE TREATMENTS AND TAILORED HOME PRACTICE. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA THERAPY HAS POTENTIAL AS AN ADJUNCT THERAPY TO IMPROVE RA SYMPTOMS, INCREASE SELF-CARE BEHAVIOURS AND MANAGE STRESS AND NEGATIVE AFFECT SUCH AS ANXIETY. A LARGER MULTI-CENTRE STUDY IS THEREFORE WARRANTED.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
6 2695  34 YOGA INFLUENCES RECOVERY DURING INPATIENT REHABILITATION: A PILOT STUDY. PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ADD YOGA THERAPY TO INPATIENT REHABILITATION AND ASSESS WHETHER PATIENTS CHOSE TO ENGAGE IN YOGA THERAPY IN ADDITION TO OTHER DAILY THERAPIES, TO DESCRIBE PATIENTS' PERCEPTIONS OF HOW YOGA THERAPY INFLUENCED RECOVERY, AND TO ASSESS AND DESCRIBE PATIENT SATISFACTION WITH THE PROGRAM. METHODS: THIS WAS A SINGLE-ARM PILOT STUDY, ADDING YOGA THERAPY TO ONGOING INPATIENT REHABILITATION. YOGA THERAPY WAS OFFERED AS GROUP YOGA OR INDIVIDUAL YOGA TWICE A WEEK. SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW QUESTIONS WERE COMPLETED VIA TELEPHONE POST-DISCHARGE. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 55 OF THE 77 (71%) PEOPLE CONTACTED ABOUT THE STUDY ENGAGED IN YOGA THERAPY IN THE INPATIENT REHABILITATION SETTING FOR THIS STUDY AND 31 (56%) OF THESE COMPLETED THE SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW QUESTIONS. QUALITATIVE DATA SUPPORT THAT PARTICIPANTS PERCEIVED THAT YOGA THERAPY IMPROVED BREATHING, RELAXATION, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING. OVERALL, PARTICIPANTS WERE SATISFIED WITH THE PROGRAM, ALTHOUGH THEY OFTEN INDICATED THEY WOULD LIKE INCREASED FLEXIBILITY OR FREQUENCY OF YOGA. ALMOST ALL PARTICIPANTS (97%) SAID THEY WOULD RECOMMEND THE YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM TO OTHERS IN INPATIENT REHABILITATION. CONCLUSION: WE WERE ABLE TO ADD YOGA THERAPY TO ONGOING INPATIENT REHABILITATION AND PARTICIPANTS PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF HAVING THE YOGA THERAPY IN THEIR REHABILITATION STAY.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
7 1529  40 IYENGAR YOGA FOR YOUNG ADULTS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS: RESULTS FROM A MIXED-METHODS PILOT STUDY. CONTEXT: RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA) IS A CHRONIC DISEASE THAT OFTEN IMPACTS PATIENT'S QUALITY OF LIFE. FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WITH RA, THERE IS A NEED FOR REHABILITATIVE APPROACHES THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE SAFE AND TO LEAD TO IMPROVED FUNCTIONING. OBJECTIVES: THIS PILOT STUDY INVESTIGATED THE FEASIBILITY OF A SINGLE-ARM, GROUP-ADMINISTERED, SIX-WEEK, BIWEEKLY IYENGAR YOGA (IY) PROGRAM FOR EIGHT YOUNG ADULTS WITH RA. METHODS: IY IS KNOWN FOR ITS USE OF PROPS, THERAPEUTIC SEQUENCES DESIGNED FOR PATIENT POPULATIONS, EMPHASIS ON ALIGNMENT, AND A RIGOROUS TEACHER TRAINING. TREATMENT OUTCOMES WERE EVALUATED USING A MIXED-METHODS APPROACH THAT COMBINED QUANTITATIVE RESULTS FROM STANDARDIZED QUESTIONNAIRES AND QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WITH PARTICIPANTS. RESULTS: INITIAL ATTRITION WAS 37% (N=3) AFTER THE FIRST WEEK BECAUSE OF SCHEDULING CONFLICTS AND A PRIOR NON-RA RELATED INJURY. HOWEVER, THE REMAINING PARTICIPANTS (N=5) COMPLETED BETWEEN 75% AND 100% OF TREATMENT SESSIONS (MEAN=95%). NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. THE QUANTITATIVE RESULTS INDICATED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN PAIN, PAIN DISABILITY, DEPRESSION, MENTAL HEALTH, VITALITY, AND SELF-EFFICACY. INTERVIEWS DEMONSTRATED IMPROVEMENT IN RA SYMPTOMS AND FUNCTIONING BUT UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHETHER THE INTERVENTION AFFECTED PAIN. CONCLUSION: THESE PRELIMINARY FINDINGS INDICATE THAT IY IS A FEASIBLE COMPLEMENTARY APPROACH FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WITH RA, ALTHOUGH LARGER CLINICAL TRIALS ARE NEEDED TO DEMONSTRATE SAFETY AND EFFICACY.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
8 1710  40 PERCEIVED ACTIVITIES AND PARTICIPATION OUTCOMES OF A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE: A MIXED METHODS STUDY. PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD) OFTEN LEADS TO POOR BALANCE, INCREASED FALLS, AND FEAR OF FALLING, ALL OF WHICH CAN REDUCE PARTICIPATION IN LIFE ACTIVITIES. YOGA, WHICH USUALLY INCLUDES PHYSICAL EXERCISE, CAN IMPROVE FUNCTIONING AND LIFE PARTICIPATION; HOWEVER, LIMITED RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONDUCTED ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON LIFE PARTICIPATION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH PD. THIS STUDY HAD TWO PURPOSES: (1) TO IDENTIFY AND UNDERSTAND THE PERCEIVED ACTIVITIES AND PARTICIPATION OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED A THERAPEUTIC YOGA INTERVENTION FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH PD; AND (2) TO COMPARE THE PERCEIVED ACTIVITIES AND PARTICIPATION OUTCOMES WITH THE OUTCOMES MEASURED IN THE CLINICAL TRIAL. A SINGLE-BLIND, RANDOMIZED, WAITLIST-CONTROLLED, PHASE II EXPLORATORY PILOT STUDY USING AN AFTER-TRIAL EMBEDDED MIXED METHODS DESIGN (CLINICAL TRIAL PRO00041068) EVALUATED THE EFFECT OF AN 8-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION ON INDIVIDUALS WITH PD. DIRECTED CONTENT ANALYSIS WAS USED TO ANALYZE FOCUS GROUP INTERVIEWS WITH PARTICIPANTS WHO COMPLETED THE YOGA INTERVENTION. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA WERE MERGED AND COMPARED USING A DATA COMPARISON MATRIX. QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS INDICATED MANY ACTIVITIES AND PARTICIPATION OUTCOMES. COMPARISON OF QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DATA INDICATED THE YOGA INTERVENTION LED TO IMPROVED BALANCE, MOBILITY, AND FUNCTIONAL GAIT, AND FEWER FALLS. THESE OUTCOMES REACHED BEYOND THE INTERVENTION AND INTO PARTICIPANTS' DAILY LIVES. RESULTS SUPPORT THE USE OF HATHA YOGA AS A COMMUNITY-BASED REHABILITATION INTERVENTION FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH PD. YOGA, AS PART OF AN INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH TO TREATMENT, CAN IMPROVE MANY TYPES OF ACTIVITIES AND PARTICIPATION OUTCOMES (E.G., MOBILITY, SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS, SELF-CARE, HANDLING STRESS, RECREATION).	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
9 1413  27 IMPLEMENTING YOGA INTO THE MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH REFRACTORY LOW BACK PAIN IN AN OUTPATIENT CLINIC SETTING. PURPOSE: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF IMPLEMENTING YOGA INTO THE TREATMENT OF PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. DESIGN: QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS WITH OPPORTUNITY FOR QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK. METHOD: EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT WAS ASSESSED USING A PRETEST/POSTTEST DESIGN OF PATIENTS WHO VOLUNTEERED TO PARTICIPATE IN YOGA CLASSES AS PART OF THEIR BACK PAIN MANAGEMENT. MEASUREMENTS INCLUDED LOW BACK PAIN RATING, PERCEPTION OF BACK PAIN INTERFERENCE WITH DAILY ACTIVITIES, AND SELF-EFFICACY IN DEALING WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. FINDINGS: ALTHOUGH NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS WERE FOUND DUE TO THE SMALL SAMPLE SIZE, MOST PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED IMPROVED INDIVIDUAL SCORES ON ALL MEASUREMENT SURVEYS INCLUDING QUALITATIVE COMMENTS. CONCLUSION: BASED ON THE FINDINGS OF THIS PILOT STUDY, FURTHER STUDIES ON IMPLEMENTING YOGA INTO THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN ARE ENCOURAGED.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
10 1892  39 RELAX WHILE YOU REHABILITATE: A PILOT STUDY INTEGRATING A NOVEL, YOGA-BASED MINDFULNESS GROUP INTERVENTION INTO A RESIDENTIAL MILITARY BRAIN INJURY REHABILITATION PROGRAM. OBJECTIVE: THIS PRELIMINARY, PILOT STUDY ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A GROUP-BASED, MINDFULNESS INTERVENTION IN A RESIDENTIAL, REHABILITATION SETTING WITH SPECIFIC FOCUS ON ASSESSING PARTICIPANTS' SELF-REPORT OF PERCEIVED BENEFIT OF THE INTERVENTION ON OVERALL HEALTH, PAIN, SLEEP, MOOD/ANXIETY, ATTENTION, AND SELF-AWARENESS, AS WELL AS IMPLEMENTING MODIFICATIONS NEEDED FOR SUCCESSFUL INTERVENTION APPLICATION AMONG A DIVERSE, CLINICAL MILITARY POPULATION. METHOD/DESIGN: PARTICIPANTS WERE 19 VETERANS AND ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBERS WITH A HISTORY OF TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI; 63% SEVERE) WHO COMPLETED A MINDFULNESS-BASED GROUP INTERVENTION DURING INPATIENT ADMISSION AT A VETERANS AFFAIRS POLYTRAUMA TRANSITIONAL REHABILITATION PROGRAM (PTRP). MINDFULNESS AND YOGA SKILLS WERE TAUGHT IN A REQUIRED, WEEKLY GROUP INCORPORATED INTO PARTICIPANTS' REHABILITATION SCHEDULE. OPINIONS AND ATTITUDES ABOUT MINDFULNESS, AS WELL AS PERTINENT SELF-REPORT OUTCOME MEASURES, WERE OBTAINED PRE- AND POSTGROUP PARTICIPATION. RESULTS: RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT PARTICIPATION IN THE GROUP WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH INDIVIDUALS' SELF-REPORTED BELIEF ABOUT THE BENEFIT OF MINDFULNESS IN THE AREAS OF OVERALL HEALTH, PHYSICAL HEALTH, MOOD, FOCUS, AND SELF-AWARENESS. THE MORE GROUPS ATTENDED, THE MORE POSITIVE THE PARTICIPANTS' BELIEFS ABOUT POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OVERALL HEALTH AND MOOD BECAME, EVEN WHILE CONTROLLING FOR LENGTH OF REHABILITATION STAY. ADDITIONALLY, SEVERAL SPECIFIC GROUP MODIFICATIONS RELEVANT TO THIS POPULATION (E.G., PHYSICAL/ENVIRONMENTAL MODIFICATIONS, REPETITION, IGNORING/REORIENTING) WERE IMPLEMENTED TO SUPPORT SUCCESSFUL PARTICIPATION. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: THESE PRELIMINARY AND EXPLORATORY FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT IT MAY BE WORTHWHILE FOR PSYCHOLOGISTS, CLINICIANS, AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WORKING WITH A MIXED TBI POPULATION, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY A MILITARY POPULATION WITH TBI, TO CONSIDER INTRODUCING MINDFULNESS SKILLS AS PART OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY REHABILITATION.

11   13  38 "MORE THAN I EXPECTED": PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE AMONG OLDER ADULTS AT RISK FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED WITH PARTICIPANTS FROM TRIALS EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF AN IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE CURRENT STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF YOGA IN A POPULATION OF OLDER, PREDOMINANTLY OVERWEIGHT ADULTS PARTICIPATING IN A GENTLE 8-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM. DESIGN: THIS STUDY USED A CONSTRUCTIVIST-INTERPRETIVE APPROACH TO NATURALISTIC INQUIRY. SETTING: A TOTAL OF 42 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE INTERVENTION AND MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR THE CURRENT QUALITATIVE STUDY. INTERVENTION: THE 8-WEEK IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM INCLUDED TWO 90-MIN YOGA CLASSES AND FIVE 30-MIN HOME SESSIONS PER WEEK. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED WEEKLY LOGS AND AN EXIT QUESTIONNAIRE AT THE END OF THE STUDY. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: QUALITATIVE DATA FROM WEEKLY LOGS AND EXIT QUESTIONNAIRES WERE COMPILED AND CONVENTIONAL CONTENT ANALYSIS PERFORMED WITH THE USE OF ATLAS.TI TO FACILITATE THE PROCESS. RESULTS: FOUR BROAD THEMES EMERGED FROM CONTENT ANALYSIS: PRACTICING YOGA IMPROVED OVERALL PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND CAPACITY (FOR 83% OF PARTICIPANTS); PRACTICING YOGA REDUCED STRESS/ANXIETY AND ENHANCED CALMNESS (83% OF PARTICIPANTS); PRACTICING YOGA ENRICHED THE QUALITY OF SLEEP (21% OF PARTICIPANTS); AND PRACTICING YOGA SUPPORTED EFFORTS TOWARD DIETARY IMPROVEMENTS (14% OF PARTICIPANTS). CONCLUSIONS: THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY HAVE ANCILLARY BENEFITS IN TERMS OF IMPROVED PHYSICAL FUNCTION, ENHANCED MENTAL/EMOTIONAL STATE, ENRICHED SLEEP QUALITY, AND IMPROVED LIFESTYLE CHOICES, AND MAY BE USEFUL AS A HEALTH PROMOTION STRATEGY IN THE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC DISEASE.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
12 2385  33 YOGA ADHERENCE IN OLDER WOMEN SIX MONTHS POST-OSTEOARTHRITIS INTERVENTION. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) IS A HIGHLY PREVALENT CONDITION WORLDWIDE. YOGA IS POTENTIALLY A SAFE AND FEASIBLE OPTION FOR MANAGING OA; HOWEVER, THE EXTENT OF LONG-TERM YOGA ADHERENCE IS UNKNOWN. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE YOGA ADHERENCE 6 MONTHS AFTER PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED AN OA INTERVENTION PROGRAM. METHODS: THIS FOLLOW-UP STUDY EMPLOYED A CROSS-SECTIONAL DESCRIPTIVE DESIGN USING SURVEY, INTERVIEW, AND VIDEO RECORDINGS TO COLLECT BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA. A TOTAL OF 31 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED AND RETURNED THE SURVEY, AND 10 VIDEOTAPED THEIR YOGA PRACTICE FOR 1 WEEK AND PARTICIPATED IN A FACE-TO-FACE INTERVIEW. RESULTS: A MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS (N=19, 61%) REPORTED THAT THEY WERE STILL PRACTICING YOGA 6 MONTHS AFTER THE INTERVENTION PROGRAM. ON AVERAGE, PARTICIPANTS REPORTED PRACTICING 21 TO 30 MINUTES OF YOGA PER DAY (32%) 3 TO 4 DAYS PER WEEK (47%). "FEELING GOOD OR FEELING BETTER AFTER YOGA PRACTICE" (50%) AND "SET ASIDE A TIME" (31%) WERE THE MOST COMMON MOTIVATING FACTORS FOR YOGA ADHERENCE. DEALING WITH HEALTH PROBLEMS (42%), HAVING PAIN (25%), AND BEING TOO BUSY (25%) WERE THE MAJOR BARRIERS. QUALITATIVE DATA REVEALED THAT PARTICIPANTS: (1) USED MINDFUL YOGA MOVEMENT, (2) INCORPORATED OTHER FORMS OF EXERCISE AND RESOURCES DURING YOGA PRACTICE, AND (3) CREATED PERSONALIZED YOGA PROGRAMS. ADDITIONALLY, THE PARTICIPANTS REPORTED LESS OA PAIN, INCREASED PHYSICAL ENDURANCE, AND MORE RELAXATION. CONCLUSION: MANY PARTICIPANTS ADHERED TO YOGA PRACTICE 6 MONTHS POST-INTERVENTION ALTHOUGH NOT AT THE FREQUENCY AND SEQUENCE AS PRESCRIBED. FEELING BETTER AFTER PRACTICE MOTIVATED PARTICIPANTS, BUT OTHER FACTORS REMAINED KEY BARRIERS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
13   14  39 "NOW I SEE A BRIGHTER DAY": EXPECTATIONS AND PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF AN IYENGAR YOGA INTERVENTION FOR YOUNG PATIENTS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA) IS A CHRONIC DISEASE CHARACTERIZED BY INFLAMMATION OF JOINTS AND ASSOCIATED FATIGUE, DETERIORATED RANGE OF MOTION, AND IMPAIRED PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING. YOUNG ADULTS WITH RA ARE AT A PARTICULAR RISK FOR COMPROMISED HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, AND THERE IS A NEED FOR SAFE, EFFECTIVE COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT IN ADDITION TO TRADITIONAL MEDICAL APPROACHES. THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO USE FACE-TO-FACE PARTICIPANT INTERVIEWS, CONDUCTED BEFORE AND AFTER AN IYENGAR YOGA (IY) PROGRAM, TO EXAMINE MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH YOGA MAY BE BENEFICIAL TO YOUNG ADULTS WITH RA.THIS PILOT STUDY UTILIZED A SINGLE-ARM DESIGN WHERE ALL PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED THE INTERVENTION. CLASSES WERE TAUGHT TWICE PER WEEK (1.5 HOURS EACH) FOR 6 WEEKS BY AN IY TEACHER QUALIFIED IN THERAPEUTICS. INTERVIEW THEMES INCLUDED PARTICIPANTS' BASELINE EXPECTATIONS ABOUT YOGA AND VIEWPOINTS AS TO HOW THEIR FUNCTIONING HAD BEEN IMPACTED BY THE IY INTERVENTION WERE EXAMINED. FIVE YOUNG ADULTS WITH RA AGED 24-31 YEARS (MEAN = 28; 80% FEMALE) COMPLETED THE YOGA INTERVENTION. PARTICIPANTS CONSISTENTLY REPORTED THAT YOGA HELPED WITH ENERGY, RELAXATION AND MOOD AND THEY DISCUSSED PERCEIVED MECHANISMS FOR HOW YOGA IMPACTED WELL-BEING. MECHANISMS INCLUDED PHYSICAL CHANGES SUCH AS RANGE OF MOTION AND PHYSIOLOGICAL AWARENESS, AND PSYCHOSPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENTS SUCH AS ACCEPTANCE, COPING, SELF-EFFICACY AND MINDFULNESS. THOUGH THE STUDY IS LIMITED, PARTICIPANTS' RESPONSES PROVIDE COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT IY FOR RA PATIENTS IS AN INTERVENTION WORTHY OF FURTHER EXPLORATION. THE MECHANISMS AND OUTCOMES REPORTED BY PARTICIPANTS SUPPORT A BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL MODEL, WHICH PROPOSES THAT YOGA BENEFITS PATIENTS THROUGH BOTH PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOSPIRITUAL CHANGES.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
14 2284  34 THE USE OF YOGA AS A GROUP INTERVENTION FOR PEDIATRIC CHRONIC PAIN REHABILITATION: EXPLORING QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE OUTCOMES. PURPOSE: WITH THE INCREASE IN OPIOID USE OVER THE LAST DECADE, MIND-BODY APPROACHES TO PEDIATRIC PAIN MANAGEMENT HAVE BEEN TRENDING. TO DATE, THERE IS LIMITED RESEARCH REGARDING THE USE OF YOGA WITH PEDIATRIC CHRONIC PAIN. THIS STUDY AIMS TO GAUGE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GROUP YOGA AS PART OF CHRONIC PAIN REHABILITATION AND ONE'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE PRACTICING INDEPENDENTLY BY EXPLORING QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION. METHODS: A SINGLE THERAPIST USED YOGA AS A GROUP PHYSICAL THERAPY INTERVENTION ONCE A WEEK FOR 60 MINUTES. YOGA EDUCATION, IYENGAR YOGA COMPONENTS, RELAXATION, AND STRETCHING WERE INCORPORATED INTO THE THERAPEUTIC YOGA SESSION. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION WAS COLLECTED. RESULTS: QUALITATIVE OUTCOMES PROVIDED VALUABLE DATA ABOUT DISTRACTIONS AND BENEFITS. QUANTITATIVE OUTCOMES SHOWED THAT THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN AREAS SUCH AS MENTAL TENSION, EMOTIONAL TENSION, MUSCLE TENSION, AND PAIN (ALL P < 0.001 SIGNIFICANT). CONCLUSION: PEDIATRIC CHRONIC PAIN PATIENTS CAN IDENTIFY MANY BENEFITS AFTER A SINGLE GROUP YOGA SESSION. IT COMBINES THE PHYSICAL AND COGNITIVE ASPECTS OF INTERDISCIPLINARY PAIN REHABILITATION FOR CONTINUED USE AFTER DISCHARGE. THE USE OF YOGA IS AN ECONOMICAL MEANS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AFTER DISCHARGE TO PROMOTE LONG-TERM BENEFITS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
15 1711  29 PERCEIVED BENEFITS AND BARRIERS TO YOGA PARTICIPATION AFTER STROKE: A FOCUS GROUP APPROACH. BACKGROUND: AND PURPOSE: THERE IS INCREASING EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST YOGA CAN BE BENEFICIAL TO HEALTH AND WELLBEING AFTER STROKE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO IDENTIFY PERCEIVED BENEFITS AND BARRIERS TO YOGA PARTICIPATION AMONG ADULTS WITH CHRONIC STROKE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TWENTY-SIX COMMUNITY DWELLING ADULTS (14 FEMALE, 12 MALE) WHO WERE AT LEAST 6-MONTHS POST-STROKE PARTICIPATED IN FOUR FOCUS GROUPS HELD AT LOCAL STROKE RECOVERY MEETINGS. DATA WAS RECORDED AND TRANSCRIPTS WERE ANALYSED THEMATICALLY. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS IDENTIFIED WHOLE BODY BENEFITS, THE RETURN OF CONNECTION AND FEELING HEALTH IN MIND AS THE PRIMARY BENEFITS OF YOGA. PERCEIVED BARRIERS INCLUDED PHYSICAL BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATION, COGNITIVE CHALLENGES, ENVIRONMENTAL ACCESS, AND FINANCIAL LIMITATIONS. CONCLUSION: STROKE SURVIVORS PERCEIVE YOGA PRACTICE PROVIDES BENEFITS IN 'CONNECTEDNESS'. FUTURE INTERVENTIONS SHOULD RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF YOGA INSTRUCTOR TRAINING, FOCUS ON THE MIND-BODY CONNECTION ASPECTS OF YOGA, AND MODIFYING ACTIVITIES TO SAFELY ACCOMMODATE THE PHYSICAL ABILITIES OF THE PARTICIPANTS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
16 2430  29 YOGA AND PHYSICAL REHABILITATION MEDICINE: A RESEARCH PARTNERSHIP IN INTEGRATIVE CARE. MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS YOGA, THAT TEACH STRESS MANAGEMENT WITH PHYSICAL ACTIVITY MAY BE WELL SUITED FOR INVESTIGATION IN BOTH OSTEOARTHRITIS AND RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED AS VIABLE CARE OPTIONS INTEGRATIVE STUDIES NEED TO OFFER A COMPREHENSIVE DESIGN AND INCLUDE CLINICIANS FAMILIAR WITH THE DISEASE PROCESS OF THE STUDY POPULATIONS. A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE REVEALS A DEARTH OF INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN YOGA AND PHYSICAL REHABILITATION MEDICINE. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE COLLABORATION WITH PHYSICAL REHABILITATION MEDICINE TO COLLECT RELEVANT PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION MEASURES FOR AN ON-GOING PILOT ACCEPTABILITY/FEASIBILITY YOGA STUDY FOR MINORITY PATIENTS WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS OR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. AN INTERDISCIPLINARY CLINICAL RESEARCH TEAM SELECTED PSYCHOSOCIAL AND PHYSICAL MEASURES FOR A COMMUNITY SAMPLE OF BILINGUAL MINORITY PATIENTS, NOT TYPICALLY IDENTIFIED AS PRACTICING YOGA. SIXTEEN FEMALE ADULTS AGED 40-63 YEARS (MEAN =51) COMPLETED BASELINE PHYSICAL ASSESSMENTS USING SINGLE LEG STANCE, FUNCTIONAL REACH TEST, TIME UP AND GO TEST, TIMED UP FROM THE FLOOR TEST AND THE DISABILITIES OF THE ARM, SHOULDER AND HAND MEASURES. BASELINE VALUES SHOW AN AVERAGE LEVEL OF FUNCTIONAL ABILITY PRIOR TO BEGINNING THE INTERVENTION. PRELIMINARY RESULTS INDICATE SOME IMPROVEMENT; HOWEVER, SELECTED MEASURES MAY NOT HAVE THE SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY NEEDED TO IDENTIFY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. IN THIS STUDY, COMBINING INTERDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVES ENHANCED THE QUALITY OF THE RESEARCH STUDY DESIGN. THE EXPERIENCE OF THIS INTERDISCIPLINARY CLINICAL RESEARCH TEAM OPENS THE DISCUSSION FOR FUTURE COLLABORATIONS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
17 2243  33 THE INFLUENCE OF TAI CHI AND YOGA ON BALANCE AND FALLS IN A RESIDENTIAL CARE SETTING: A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL. ABSTRACT FALLS AMONGST OLDER PEOPLE IS A GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN. WHILST FALLING IS NOT A TYPICAL FEATURE OF AGEING, OLDER PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO FALL. FALL INJURIES AMONGST OLDER PEOPLE ARE A LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AND DISABILITY. MANY OLDER PEOPLE DO NOT DO REGULAR EXERCISE SO THAT THEY LOSE MUSCLE TONE, STRENGTH, AND FLEXIBILITY WHICH AFFECT BALANCE AND PREDISPOSE THEM TO FALLS. THE MANAGEMENT OF FALLS IN RESIDENTIAL CARE SETTINGS IS A MAJOR CONCERN WITH STRATEGIES FOR PREVENTION AND MONITORING A FOCUS IN THIS SETTING. YOGA AND TAI CHI HAVE SHOWN POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE BALANCE AND PREVENT FALLS IN OLDER ADULTS. THEY ALSO HAVE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE PAIN AND QUALITY OF LIFE. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF CONDUCTING A 3-ARM RCT WITH FRAIL OLDER PEOPLE IN A RESIDENTIAL CARE SETTING TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT A 14 WEEK MODIFIED TAI CHI OR YOGA PROGRAM IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN USUAL CARE ACTIVITY IN IMPROVING BALANCE FUNCTION, QUALITY OF LIFE, PAIN EXPERIENCE AND IN REDUCING NUMBER OF FALLS. THERE WERE NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE THREE GROUPS IN THE OCCURRENCE OF FALLS. YOGA DEMONSTRATED A SLIGHT DECREASE IN FALL INCIDENCE; QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVED FOR THE TAI CHI GROUP. ONLY THE YOGA GROUP EXPERIENCED A REDUCTION IN AVERAGE PAIN SCORES THOUGH NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. THE FINDINGS OF THE STUDY SUGGEST IT IS POSSIBLE TO SAFELY IMPLEMENT MODIFIED YOGA AND TAI CHI IN A RESIDENTIAL CARE SETTING AND EVALUATE THIS USING RCT DESIGN. THEY SHOW POSITIVE CHANGES TO BALANCE, PAIN AND QUALITY OF LIFE AND A HIGH LEVEL OF INTEREST THROUGH ATTENDANCE AMONGST THE OLDER PARTICIPANTS. THE RESULTS SUPPORT OFFERING TAI CHI AND YOGA TO OLDER PEOPLE WHO ARE FRAIL AND DEPENDENT WITH PHYSICAL AND COGNITIVE LIMITATIONS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
18 1684  25 OPEN TRIAL OF VINYASA YOGA FOR PERSISTENTLY DEPRESSED INDIVIDUALS: EVIDENCE OF FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF VINYASA YOGA AS AN ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSED PATIENTS WHO WERE NOT RESPONDING ADEQUATELY TO ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATION. THE AUTHORS ALSO PLANNED TO ASK PARTICIPANTS FOR QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK ON THEIR EXPERIENCE OF THE CLASS AND TO ASSESS CHANGE OVER TIME IN DEPRESSION AND IN POSSIBLE MEDIATING VARIABLES. THE AUTHORS RECRUITED 11 PARTICIPANTS IN 1 MONTH FOR AN 8-WEEK OPEN TRIAL OF YOGA CLASSES. THEY FOUND THAT 10 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENTS, 9 OF 10 WERE POSITIVE ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE, AND ALL PROVIDED FEEDBACK ABOUT WHAT WAS AND WAS NOT HELPFUL ABOUT YOGA, AS WELL AS BARRIERS TO CLASS ATTENDANCE. OVER THE 2-MONTH PERIOD, PARTICIPANTS EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN AN ASPECT OF MINDFULNESS AND IN BEHAVIOR ACTIVATION. THIS PILOT STUDY PROVIDED SUPPORT FOR CONTINUING TO INVESTIGATE VINYASA YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION. THE NEXT STEP REQUIRED IS A RIGOROUS RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
19  112  24 A PILOT STUDY OF A MINDFULNESS INFORMED YOGA INTERVENTION IN YOUNG PEOPLE WITH PSYCHOSIS. AIM: TO DETERMINE THE ACCEPTABILITY AND SAFETY OF A MINDFULNESS INFORMED YOGA INTERVENTION AS ADJUNCT TO USUAL CARE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WITH EARLY PSYCHOSIS. METHODS: PEOPLE AGED 16-25 YEARS ATTENDING A COMMUNITY-BASED SPECIALIST EARLY PSYCHOSIS CLINIC WERE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN A 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. THE INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF 1-H WEEKLY CLASSES OF MINDFULNESS INFORMED YOGA. ACCEPTABILITY WAS MEASURED BY UPTAKE, ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPANTS' SATISFACTION. SAFETY WAS MEASURED BY INCIDENCE OF PHYSICAL INJURY, PARTICIPANTS' LEVEL OF COMFORT, DISTRESS AND ANXIETY DURING THE SESSIONS, AND THE FOLLOWING MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES: POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE PSYCHOTIC, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY AND STRESS SYMPTOMS, SLEEP QUALITY AND FUNCTIONING. RESULTS: OF THOSE WHO CONSENTED TO THE STUDY, 80% (12) PARTICIPATED AND ON AVERAGE ATTENDED 4.4 YOGA CLASSES. THERE WERE NO PHYSICAL INJURIES AND PARTICIPANTS REPORTED MINIMAL DISTRESS AND ANXIETY. POST-INTERVENTION, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND AN IMPROVEMENT IN FUNCTION. CONCLUSIONS: MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA INTERVENTIONS ARE BOTH ACCEPTABLE AND SAFE AS AN INTERVENTION FOR YOUTH WITH EARLY PSYCHOSIS. THOUGH NUMBERS WERE SMALL, THE STUDY SHOWS PROMISE FOR YOGA AS A POTENTIALLY USEFUL INTERVENTION. IMPORTANTLY, THERE WAS NO DETERIORATION IN MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES. A LARGER TRIAL EVALUATING CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS IS NOW TIMELY.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
20 1896  34 RESPIRATORY, PHYSICAL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFITS OF BREATH-FOCUSED YOGA FOR ADULTS WITH SEVERE TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI): A BRIEF PILOT STUDY REPORT. OBJECTIVE: THIS PILOT STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF BREATH-FOCUSED YOGA ON RESPIRATORY, PHYSICAL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONING FOR ADULTS WITH SEVERE TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI). PARTICIPANTS: TEN INDIVIDUALS WITH SEVERE TBI WHO SELF-SELECTED TO ATTEND WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES AND 4 NO-TREATMENT CONTROLS WERE EVALUATED. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSESSED AT PRETREATMENT BASELINE AND AT 3-MONTH INTERVALS FOR A TOTAL OF 4 TIME POINTS OVER 40 WEEKS. OUTCOMES OF INTEREST INCLUDED OBSERVED EXHALE STRENGTH, ABILITY TO HOLD A BREATH OR A TONE, BREATHING RATE, COUNTED BREATHS (INHALE AND EXHALE), AND HEART RATE, AS WELL AS SELF-REPORTED PHYSICAL AND PSYCHO-LOGICAL WELL-BEING. RESULTS: REPEATED WITHIN-GROUP ANALYSES OF VARIANCE REVEALED THAT THE YOGA GROUP DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT LONGITUDINAL CHANGE ON SEVERAL MEASURES OF OBSERVED RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONING AND SELF-REPORTED PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING OVER A 40-WEEK PERIOD. THOSE IN THE CONTROL GROUP SHOWED MARGINAL IMPROVEMENT ON 2 OF THE 6 MEASURES OF RESPIRATORY HEALTH, PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL FUNCTIONING, EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING, AND GENERAL HEALTH. THE SMALL SAMPLE SIZES PRECLUDED THE ANALYSIS OF BETWEEN GROUP DIFFERENCES. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY PROVIDES PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE THAT BREATH-FOCUSED YOGA MAY IMPROVE RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONING AND SELF-PERCEIVED PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING OF ADULTS WITH SEVERE TBI.	2012

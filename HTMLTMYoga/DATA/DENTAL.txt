1 2097 126 THE EFFECT OF YOGA IN STRESS REDUCTION FOR DENTAL STUDENTS PERFORMING THEIR FIRST PERIODONTAL SURGERY: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. CONTEXT: THE DENTAL STUDENTS EXPERIENCE A LOT OF STRESS, WHICH INCREASE WHEN THEY PERFORM THEIR FIRST SURGICAL PROCEDURE. YOGA AS AN ANXIOLYTIC TOOL IN ANXIETY REDUCTION HAS BEEN PRACTICED OVER CENTURIES IN INDIA. AIM: TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN REDUCING THE STATE TRAIT ANXIETY OF DENTAL STUDENTS BEFORE THEIR FIRST PERIODONTAL SURGERY PERFORMANCE. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY USING A TWO-WAY SPLIT PLOT DESIGN (PRE-POST-TEST) WAS CONDUCTED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PERIODONTICS, PACIFIC DENTAL COLLEGE, UDAIPUR, INDIA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ONE HUNDRED CLINICAL DENTAL STUDENTS WHO WERE READY TO PERFORM THEIR FIRST PERIODONTAL SURGERY WERE SELECTED. STUDENTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO TWO GROUPS AND WERE GIVEN A 60-MIN SESSION ON STRESS REDUCTION. GROUP A, YOGIC INTERVENTION GROUP, WERE INSTRUCTED TO DO YOGA AND THEIR PERFORMANCES WERE MONITORED FOR A PERIOD OF ONE WEEK AND GROUP B, CONTROL GROUP, WERE GIVEN A LECTURE ON STRESS REDUCTION WITHOUT ANY YOGA INSTRUCTIONS. THE INVESTIGATOR WHO WAS UNAWARE OF THE GROUPS HAD TAKEN THE STATE TRAIT ANXIETY SCORE OF THE STUDENTS THREE TIMES A) BEFORE ASSIGNING THEM TO EACH GROUP, B) PRIOR TO THE SURGICAL PROCEDURE AND C) IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE PERFORMANCE OF SURGERY. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: ANALYSES OF VARIANCE (ANOVA) BY SPSS V.16. RESULTS: THE STATISTICAL RESULTS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE VAS AND STATE TRAIT ANXIETY OF GROUP A COMPARED TO GROUP B (ANOVA; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY CONCLUDES THAT YOGIC BREATHING HAS A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE REDUCTION OF STATE TRAIT ANXIETY LEVEL OF DENTAL STUDENTS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
2 1921  33 ROLE OF YOGA AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN WORK-RELATED MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS AMONG DENTISTS. BACKGROUND: WORK-RELATED MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN IS ONE OF THE OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS IN DENTISTS. AIMS: TO FIND THE PREVALENCE AND SEVERITY OF MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN IN DENTISTS, TO COMPARE MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN AMONG DENTISTS PRACTICING YOGA, THOSE PRACTICING PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES, AND THOSE WITHOUT ANY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND ALSO TO KNOW THE EFFECTS OF SEX, AGE, AND WORKLOAD ON MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A SELF-REPORTING WORK-RELATED QUESTIONNAIRE AND THE NORDIC QUESTIONNAIRE FOR ANALYSIS OF MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS WERE GIVEN TO GRADUATED DENTISTS ATTENDING INDIAN DENTAL CONFERENCE IN MUMBAI, TO KNOW THE MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN EXPERIENCED IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS AND FEEDBACK WAS OBTAINED FROM 220 DENTISTS. RESULTS: THE PREVALENCE OF MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN IN DENTISTS WAS 34.5%. PREVALENCE OF MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN WAS 10.5%, 21.7%, AND 45.6% IN DENTISTS WITH REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE, OTHER PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND NO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, RESPECTIVELY. THERE WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE PREVALENCE OF MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN AMONG DENTISTS WHO WERE PRACTICING YOGA WHEN COMPARED WITH THOSE IN NO REGULAR ACTIVITY GROUP. CONCLUSION: WITHIN THE LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY, THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT ROLE OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ON THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF WORK-RELATED MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS EXPERIENCED BY DENTISTS. YOGA WAS FOUND TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN OTHER MODES OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES. MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED ON MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS IN DENTISTS, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON LARGER SAMPLE SIZES AND CORRELATING OTHER FACTORS LIKE AGE AND SEX OF THE DENTISTS, DURATION OF PRACTICE, YEARS OF PRACTICING YOGA, AND WORKING HOURS PER WEEK.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
3 1070  38 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN. PURPOSE: MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH WORK STRESS AND A SHORTENED CAREER IN THE DENTAL HYGIENE PROFESSION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE IF PARTICIPATING IN TWO YOGA SESSIONS PER WEEK WOULD REDUCE THE MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN REPORTED BY DENTAL HYGIENE STUDENTS AND OR IMPACT BODY COMPOSITION.METHODS: A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF 77 DENTAL HYGIENE STUDENTS SELF-SELECTED INTO TREATMENT (YOGA) AND CONTROL GROUPS. STUDENTS IN THE YOGA GROUP PARTICIPATED IN BI-WEEKLY, 60-MINUTE YOGA SESSIONS FOR 13 CONSECUTIVE WEEKS. STUDENTS COMPLETED A QUESTIONNAIRE AND A COMPARATIVE PAIN SCALE EVALUATION PRIOR TO AND IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE STUDY PERIOD TO ASSESS MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN. ADDITIONALLY, THE OMRON HBF-514C FULL BODY COMPOSITION SENSING MONITOR AND SCALE WAS USED TO MEASURE BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), BODY FAT, AND MUSCLE PRIOR TO AND UPON COMPLETION OF THE STUDY. PAIRED SAMPLE T-TESTS AND INDEPENDENT T-TESTS WERE USED TO ANALYZE THE DATA.RESULTS: THIRTY-EIGHT DENTAL HYGIENE STUDENTS, WITH AN AVERAGE AGE OF 23.9 YEARS, PARTICIPATED IN THE YOGA GROUP AND 39 WERE ASSIGNED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. THE MAJORITY OF THE PARTICIPANTS WERE CAUCASIAN (63.6%) FEMALES (90.9%). PARTICIPANTS IN BOTH GROUPS WERE OF SIMILAR AGE, ETHNICITY, AND HAD COMPARABLE PRE-STUDY HARICH COMPARATIVE PAIN SCALE SCORES. AFTER PARTICIPATING IN THE YOGA SESSIONS, THE TREATMENT GROUP REPORTED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN (P<0.001), WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP REPORTED NO SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN (P=0.881). THE YOGA SESSIONS DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE BMI SCORES FOR THE YOGA TREATMENT GROUP (P=.984) OR THE CONTROL GROUP (P=.901).CONCLUSION: THIS RESEARCH SUPPORTS THE PRACTICE OF BI-WEEKLY YOGA SESSIONS AS BENEFICIAL IN DECREASING MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN IN DENTAL HYGIENE STUDENTS. YOGA CAN BE CONSIDERED A VIABLE COMPLEMENTARY HEALTH APPROACH TO INCORPORATE INTO STUDENT SCHEDULES AS A MEANS OF INCREASING THE HEALTH AND LONGEVITY OF A DENTAL HYGIENE CAREER.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
4 2017  28 SURVEY ON UTILITY OF YOGA AS AN ALTERNATIVE THERAPY FOR OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS AMONG DENTAL PRACTIONERS. BACKGROUND: THE THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL OF YOGA ARE OFTEN CONSIDERED COMPLEMENTARY TO VARIOUS FORMS OF MEDICAL PRACTICE. VERY FEW STUDIES HAVE EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN THE TREATMENT OF OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS AMONG DENTISTS. HENCE, THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE THE ADOPTION OF YOGA TECHINQUES AS AN ALTERNATIVE THERAPY IN TREATMENT OF PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS AMONG DENTAL GENERAL PRACTITIONERS IN CHENNAI, INDIA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A VALIDATED CLOSED-ENDED QUESTIONNAIRE WAS CIRCULATED TO 500 DENTAL GENERAL PRACTITIONERS IN CHENNAI, INDIA AND WE RECEIVED 394 COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES. THE QUESTIONNAIRE DOCUMENTED DEMOGRAPHIC DATA, OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS AND THE TYPE OF TREATMENT TAKEN FOR THE HAZARDS. RESULTS: MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN WITH STRESS (47%) WAS THE MOST COMMON OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD REPORTED, FOLLOWED BY ONLY STRESS (27.4%), AND ONLY MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN (25.6%). ONLY 9.6% OF PRACTITIONERS ADOPTED YOGA AS AN ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT FOR THESE OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS. INTERESTINGLY, MAJORITY (46.4%) OF THEM DID EXERCISE, GYM, MASSAGE, WALKING AND HEARD MUSIC. SURPRISINGLY, 43.9% DID NOT TAKE ANY MEASURES TO TREAT THESE OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS. HOWEVER 53.3% OF THE DENTISTS WHO DID NOT CONSIDER YOGA AS AN ALTERNATIVE THERAPY, STATED LACK OF TIME AS A REASON FOR NOT PRACTICING YOGA WHILE 17.6% OF THEM DON'T BELIEVE YOGA AS A THERAPY. CONCLUSION: DESPITE MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN AND STRESS BEING THE MOST COMMON OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD PREVALENT AMONG DENTISTS, OVER 50% OF THE SUBJECTS SURVEYED DIDN'T SEEK ANY MEASURE TO TREAT THESE OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS AND ONLY 10% OF THEM PRACTICED YOGA AS THE ALTERNATIVE THERAPY.	2015

6 1409  43 IMPACT OF YOGA ON PERIODONTAL DISEASE AND STRESS MANAGEMENT. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT, EFFECTIVE, AND VALUABLE TOOLS AVAILABLE FOR MAN TO OVERCOME VARIOUS PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS. STRESS CONTRIBUTES SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE PATHOGENESIS OF PERIODONTAL DISEASES; HENCE, IT BECOMES IMPORTANT TO REDUCE THE LEVEL OF STRESS FOR PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF DISEASES. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: THE PRESENT STUDY WAS AIMED: (1) TO UNDERSTAND AND ANALYZE THE POSSIBILITIES OF EMPLOYING YOGIC PRACTICES IN THE TREATMENT OF PERIODONTAL DISEASE ALONG WITH CONVENTIONAL DENTAL THERAPY, (2) TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECT OF STRESS ON PERIODONTAL TREATMENT OUTCOME, (3) TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PERIODONTAL DISEASE WITH REFERENCE TO STRESS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AN OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENT-BASED PARALLEL GROUP RANDOMIZED STUDY WAS PERFORMED WITH STANDARD TREATMENT FOR PERIODONTAL DISEASE YOGA THERAPY AS GROUP II AND ONLY STANDARD TREATMENT AS GROUP I. PERIODONTAL HEALTH STATUS WAS RECORDED USING INDICES OF MODIFIED PLAQUE INDEX (PI), BLEEDING ON PROBING (BOP), PROBING DEPTH, AND CLINICAL ATTACHMENT LOSS (CAL). THE COHEN'S PERCEIVED STRESS QUESTIONNAIRE WAS ALSO USED TO DETERMINE STRESS SEVERITY. THE YOGIC INTERVENTION CONSISTS OF LECTURES AND PRACTICAL SESSIONS ON ASANAS, PRANAYAMA, KRIYAS, AND MEDITATION. RESULTS: REPEATED MEASURE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE (P < 0.001) IN ALL THE OUTCOME VARIABLES WITH RESPECT TO TIME IN BOTH GROUPS. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT MEAN PI SCORE REDUCED BY 1.35 IN GROUP II AS COMPARED TO 0.54 IN GROUP I, MEAN PROBING POCKET DEPTH REDUCED BY 1.60 IN GROUP II AS COMPARED TO ONLY 0.68 IN GROUP I, AND MEAN CAL SCORE REDUCED BY 1.60 IN GROUP II AS COMPARED TO 0.68 IN GROUP I. SIMILARLY, COHEN'S PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE SCORE ALSO REDUCED BY 18.76 POINTS IN GROUP II AS COMPARED TO ONLY 2.58 POINTS IN GROUP I, BOP ALSO SHOWS BETTER IMPROVEMENT IN GROUP II WITH A REDUCTION OF 0.68 AS COMPARED TO REDUCTION OF ONLY 0.08 IN GROUP I. THE RESULTS OBTAINED ASCERTAINED THE ROLE OF YOGA IN STRESS REDUCTION IN PERIODONTAL DISEASE. CONCLUSION: ALTHOUGH YOGA DOES NOT PLAY A DIRECT ROLE IN IMPROVING PERIODONTAL DISEASE, IT ACCELERATES THE TREATMENT OUTCOMES BY COMBATING THE STRESS WHICH IS A MAJOR FACTOR AFFECTING THE TREATMENT OF PERIODONTAL DISEASE.	2017	
                                                                                                                                       
7   36  43 A 15-MINUTE YOGA INTERVENTION TO REDUCE ENTRY-LEVEL DENTAL HYGIENE STUDENT STRESS. PURPOSE: HEALTH SCIENCE STUDENTS HAVE AN INCREASED SOURCE OF STRESS DUE TO THE RIGOROUS CURRICULUM, HIGH CLINICAL EXPECTATIONS, AND ACADEMIC DEMANDS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A 15-MINUTE YOGA INTERVENTION TO REDUCE STRESS IN ENTRY-LEVEL DENTAL HYGIENE STUDENTS.METHODS: FIRST YEAR DENTAL HYGIENE STUDENTS WERE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE EXPERIMENTAL STUDY (N=32) AND WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER THE EXPERIMENTAL OR CONTROL GROUP. THE STRESS REDUCTION INTERVENTION (GENTLE YOGA MOVEMENTS, BREATHING, AND MEDITATION) WAS PERFORMED PRIOR TO EACH FINAL EXAM FOR A TOTAL OF SIX TIMES. THE CONTROL GROUP PROCEEDED WITH THEIR USUAL PRE-EXAM ROUTINES. BASELINE AND POST-TRIAL BLOOD PRESSURE, PULSE AND 10-ITEM PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE (PSS) DATA WERE RECORDED FOR BOTH GROUPS. REPEATED MEASURES OF BLOOD PRESSURE AND PULSE WERE RECORDED BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND THE CONTROL GROUP PRIOR TO EACH EXAM. DATA ANALYSES INCLUDED PAIRED-SAMPLES T-TEST, INDEPENDENT-SAMPLES T-TEST AND ANOVA, (P=0.05).RESULTS: THE MAIN EFFECT FOR YOGA FROM PRE- TO POST-SESSION WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT FOR BLOOD PRESSURE (P=0.02 SYSTOLIC; P=0.02 DIASTOLIC) BUT NOT FOR PULSE (P=0.23). SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON BLOOD PRESSURE MEASURES SHOWED YOGA MOVEMENT SESSIONS REDUCED STRESS HOWEVER THE EFFECTS SIZES WERE SMALL. THE PAIRED T-TESTS INDICATED THE 10-ITEM PSS VALUES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER (P<0.00). STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF DIFFERENTIAL, BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA VERSUS CONTROL WERE NOT DEMONSTRATED.CONCLUSION: FIFTEEN-MINUTES OF YOGA MOVEMENTS HAD FEASIBILITY, COMPLIANCE, AND APPEARED TO HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS RELATED TO STRESS REDUCTION. NO EVIDENCE OF STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE WAS DEMONSTRATED COMPARED TO THE CONTROL. RESEARCH ON A LARGER SAMPLE OF ENTRY-LEVEL DENTAL HYGIENE STUDENTS USING YOGA MOVEMENTS OVER THE COURSE OF A SEMESTER IS RECOMMENDED.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
8 2274  47 THE ROLE OF YOGA IN TREATING STRESS-RELATED SYMPTOMS IN DENTAL HYGIENE STUDENTS. CONTEXT: RESEARCH HAS PROVIDED EVIDENCE FOR YOGA'S EFFECTIVENESS IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF PAIN AND STRESS, BOTH OF WHICH HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED AS SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE MODERATORS OF STUDENT PERFORMANCE AND EXPERIENCE. AIMS: THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE FEASIBILITY AND PRELIMINARY IMPACT OF A 10-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION WITH DENTAL HYGIENE STUDENTS TO REDUCE PERCEPTIONS OF STRESS AND STRESS-RELATED SYMPTOMS. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: STUDENTS SELF-SELECTED INTO A YOGA TREATMENT VERSUS CONTROL CONDITION. THEY COMPLETED STRESS AND PAIN MEASURES AT FOUR TIME POINTS DURING AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION OR CONTROL PERIOD OF 10-WEEKS. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE STUDENTS ENROLLED IN A DENTAL HYGIENE PROGRAM. ALL 77 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED A 10-WEEK STUDY, SELF-SELECTING INTO AN INTERVENTION OR CONTROL GROUP. THEY COMPLETED THREE SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES ASSESSING PAIN AND STRESS, ADMINISTERED AT BASELINE, MID-POINT, POSTINTERVENTION, AND TWO FOLLOW-UPS. THE 10-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF 10 90-MIN YOGA SESSIONS THAT PROVIDED CHECK-INS, BREATHING EXERCISES, SEQUENCES OF POSTURES, RELAXATION EXERCISES, AND CLOSING MEDITATIONS. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: INDEPENDENT SAMPLES T-TESTS WERE USED TO COMPARE PERCEIVED STRESS LEVELS OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE CONTROL VERSUS TREATMENT GROUPS. PAIRED T-TEST WAS USED TO ASSESS DIFFERENCES IN STRESS-RELATED SYMPTOM LEVELS ACROSS TIME. RESULTS: RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT A YOGA INTERVENTION IS FEASIBLE FOR THIS GROUP AND THAT ACTIVE YOGA PRACTICE CAN LOWER PERCEIVED STRESS ACROSS MULTIPLE DOMAINS AND ACROSS TIME. CONCLUSIONS: A SPECIALLY ADAPTED AND DESIGNED 10-WEEK YOGA PROTOCOL APPEARS TO BE AN ACCESSIBLE OPTION FOR DENTAL HYGIENE PROGRAMS THAT SEEK TO SUPPORT THEIR STUDENTS IN IMPROVING OVERALL WELLBEING.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
9  423  36 BRIEF YOGA INTERVENTION FOR DENTAL AND DENTAL HYGIENE STUDENTS: A FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY STUDY. THE PRESENT STUDY INVESTIGATED WHETHER A BRIEF YOGA INTERVENTION WOULD BE FEASIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE FOR DENTAL STUDENTS. BASED ON EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ABOUT STATE MINDFULNESS (SM), CHANGE IN SELF-REPORTED SM WAS ASSESSED AS A MEASURE OF THE INTERVENTION'S FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY. A REPEATED-MEASURES WITHIN-SUBJECTS DESIGN WAS USED. PARTICIPANTS WERE THIRD- AND FOURTH-YEAR DENTAL AND DENTAL HYGIENE STUDENTS (76% FEMALE). THE STATE MINDFULNESS SCALE (SMS), A VALIDATED SELF-REPORT MEASURE OF SM WITH 2 SUBSCALES, MIND AND BODY, WAS USED. STUDENTS (N = 132) COMPLETED THE SMS IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO AND FOLLOWING A 1-HOUR YOGA INTERVENTION. DISPOSITIONAL MINDFULNESS, BURNOUT, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS WERE ALSO INVESTIGATED AS MODERATORS OF CHANGES IN STATE MINDFULNESS TO DETERMINE WHETHER PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIABLES HAD AN EFFECT ON FEASIBILITY IN THIS SAMPLE. TOTAL SM SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FROM PRE- TO POST-INTERVENTION, T(46) = 10.26, P < .001. AN ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION EFFECT IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRE-/POST-INTERVENTION SM OF MIND (BETA = 0.51, P = .048), SUCH THAT HIGHER LEVELS OF STRESS SAW GREATER INCREASES IN SM OF MIND. NO OTHER PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIABLES WERE SIGNIFICANT MODERATORS. A BRIEF YOGA INTERVENTION FOR DENTAL STUDENTS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED SM, SUGGESTING THAT YOGA INTERVENTIONS MAY BE FEASIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE IN THIS POPULATION. THE RESULTS OF MODERATION ANALYSES SUGGEST THAT A BRIEF YOGA INTERVENTION MAY BE ESPECIALLY EFFECTIVE AT INCREASING SM FOR THOSE WITH HIGH LEVELS OF STRESS. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD USE A RANDOMIZED CONTROL GROUP TO TEST GROUP DIFFERENCES IN SM AFTER A BRIEF YOGA INTERVENTION FOR DENTAL STUDENTS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
10 2337  35 UNDERUSE OF YOGA AS A REFERRAL RESOURCE BY HEALTH PROFESSIONS STUDENTS. OBJECTIVE: NEARLY 38% OF U.S. ADULTS USE COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE APPROACHES TO MANAGE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS (E.G., CHRONIC PAIN, ARTHRITIS, CANCER, HEART DISEASE, AND HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE) AND PSYCHOLOGICAL OR EMOTIONAL HEALTH CONCERNS (E.G., POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION). RESEARCH EVIDENCE HAS ACCUMULATED FOR YOGA AS AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT APPROACH FOR THESE CONDITIONS. FURTHER, YOGA HAS INCREASED IN POPULARITY AMONG HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND THE GENERAL POPULATION. GIVEN THESE TRENDS, THIS STUDY EXPLORED PERCEPTIONS ABOUT YOGA AS A VIABLE COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT TO WHICH HEALTH PROFESSIONS STUDENTS WOULD REFER PATIENTS. PARTICIPANTS: MORE THAN 1500 STUDENTS ENROLLED IN HEALTH PROFESSIONS PROGRAMS AT A PACIFIC NORTHWEST SCHOOL WERE ENROLLED; DATA WERE OBTAINED FROM 478 RESPONDENTS. DESIGN: THE STUDY ASSESSED WILLINGNESS TO REFER PATIENTS TO YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE FOR 27 SYMPTOMS (IDENTIFIED IN THE LITERATURE AS HAVING EVIDENCE FOR YOGA'S UTILITY), WHICH WERE SUBSEQUENTLY GROUPED INTO SKELETAL, PHYSICAL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ON THE BASIS OF FACTOR ANALYSIS. RESPONSES WERE ASSESSED USING A MIXED-MODEL ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE WITH HEALTH PROFESSION AND YOGA PRACTITIONER AS BETWEEN-SUBJECTS VARIABLES AND SYMPTOMS AS A WITHIN-SUBJECTS FACTOR. RESULTS: IN DESCENDING ORDER OF LIKELIHOOD TO REFER PATIENTS TO YOGA WERE STUDENTS IN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY, PHYSICIAN ASSISTANT PROGRAM, PSYCHOLOGY, PHYSICAL THERAPY, PHARMACY, DENTAL HYGIENE, SPEECH AND AUDIOLOGY, AND OPTOMETRY. ALL GROUPS PERCEIVED YOGA'S GREATEST UTILITY FOR SKELETAL SYMPTOMS, FOLLOWED BY PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS. FINDINGS ALSO REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEVEL OF PERSONAL YOGA PRACTICE AND WILLINGNESS TO REFER PATIENTS TO YOGA. CONCLUSIONS: ALTHOUGH STUDENTS EXPRESSED SOME OPENNESS TO REFERRING PATIENTS TO YOGA, RATINGS OF APPROPRIATENESS WERE NOT ACCURATELY ALIGNED WITH EXTANT EVIDENCE BASE. PERSONAL EXPERIENCE SEEMED TO BE A SALIENT FACTOR FOR ACCEPTING YOGA AS A REFERRAL TARGET. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THE IMPORTANCE OF DEVELOPING STRATEGIES TO MAKE HEALTH PROFESSIONALS MORE AWARE OF THE MERITS OF YOGA, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY THEMSELVES ARE YOGA PRACTITIONERS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                           
11 1616  39 MINDFUL AWARENESS FOR FEMALE DENTAL STUDENTS THROUGH YOGA, MOTIVATIONAL VIDEO, AND A COMBINATION OF TWO ON STRESS REDUCTION. OBJECTIVE: ASSESSMENT OF THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF YOGA, MOTIVATIONAL VIDEOS, AND A COMBINATION OF TWO ON STRESS REDUCTION IN FEMALE DENTAL STUDENTS. METHODS: THE CURRENT STUDY DESIGN IS A NONRANDOMIZED TRIAL CARRIED OUT AMONG FEMALE DENTAL STUDENTS (N = 120). THE SELECTED SUBJECTS WERE ALLOCATED INTO THREE GROUPS, NAMELY, GROUP A: YOGA GROUP ASSIGNED UNDER A PROFESSIONAL YOGA INSTRUCTOR, GROUP B: MOTIVATIONAL VIDEO GROUP, AND GROUP C: A COMBINATION OF TWO (A AND B) INVOLVING YOGA SESSIONS AND MOTIVATIONAL VIDEOS; FOLLOWING WHICH FORMATIVE EXAMINATIONS WERE CARRIED OUT AT 6 WEEKS WHICH WERE REFERRED TO AS STRESSOR 1 AND THOSE CARRIED OUT AT 12 WEEKS WERE REFERRED TO AS STRESSOR 2. USING SPIELBERGER'S STATE-TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY FOR ADULTS (STAI-A) RECORDINGS WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE, STRESSOR 1, AND STRESSOR 2. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN TRAIT ANXIETY SCORES AT BOTH STRESSORS IN ALL THE GROUPS WITH A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DEPRESSION SCORE FROM STRESSOR 1 TO 2 IN GROUP 1 AND GROUP 3 SUBJECTS. THE SIGNIFICANT DECREASE OCCURRED IN STAI-A SCORES IN GROUP 1 AND GROUP 3 SUBJECTS AT BOTH STRESSORS (P < 0.001) WITH NO CHANGE OBSERVED IN GROUP 2 SUBJECTS. CONCLUSION: THE PRESENT STUDY IS ONE OF A KIND AND POSITIVELY CORRELATES YOGA AND MOTIVATIONAL VIDEOS WITH STRESS REDUCTION. BOTH OF THESE INTERVENTIONS PROVED TO BE BENEFICIARY FOR PHYSICAL AS WELL AS MENTAL HEALTH OF STUDY SUBJECTS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
12   43  23 A CASE REPORT OF PATIENT PRACTISING YOGA LEADING TO DENTAL EROSION. THE ARTICLE PRESENTS THE CASE OF A PATIENT WHO WAS PRACTISING YOGA (KUNJAL KRIYA) WHICH LED TO DENTAL EROSION. DENTAL EROSION CAN BE DUE TO EXTRINSIC OR INTRINSIC CAUSES. THE INTRINSIC CAUSES INCLUDE VOMITING DUE TO ANOREXIA NERVOSA, REGURGITATION DUE TO ABNORMALITY IN GASTRO-INTESTINAL TRACT OR RUMINATION. A 38-YEAR-OLD MALE PATIENT PRESENTED WITH A RARE AETIOLOGY OF DENTAL EROSION. HE HAD PRACTICED KUNJAL KRIYA ONE OF THE YOGIC EXERCISES DESCRIBED IN ANCIENT INDIA. IN KUNJAL KRIYA THE PATIENT VOMITS ON AN EMPTY STOMACH IN ORDER TO CLEAN HIS OR HER GASTRO-INTESTINAL TRACT. THE PATIENT HAD PRACTICED THIS FORM OF EXERCISE FOR OVER 12 YEARS WHICH HAD LED TO SEVERE DENTAL EROSION. A PROPER CASE HISTORY SHOULD BE EVALUATED FOR EVERY PATIENT SO THAT THEY CAN BE COUNSELLED FOR ANY FACTORS THAT COULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO DENTAL HEALTH. EARLY DIAGNOSIS IS PARAMOUNT IN RECOGNISING THE AETIOLOGY OF DENTAL EROSION SO THAT DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON THE DENTITION CAN BE PREVENTED.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
13  360  37 ASSOCIATION OF YOGA PRACTICE AND SERUM CORTISOL LEVELS IN CHRONIC PERIODONTITIS PATIENTS WITH STRESS-RELATED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. AIM: REDUCING THE PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS BY VARIOUS METHODS CAN IMPROVE OVERALL HEALTH, AND YOGA IS NOW CONSIDERED AS AN EASILY AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVE METHOD. THE PRESENT CROSS-SECTIONAL PILOT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED MAINLY TO FIND THE ASSOCIATION OF YOGA PRACTICE WITH PERIODONTAL DISEASE BY MEASURING SERUM CORTISOL LEVELS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 70 SUBJECTS WITH AGE RANGE OF 35-60 YEARS SUFFERING WITH CHRONIC PERIODONTITIS WERE DIVIDED INTO GROUP I (WITH STRESS), GROUP II (WITHOUT STRESS), AND GROUP III (PRACTICING YOGA). PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION WAS CARRIED OUT USING HAMILTON ANXIETY RATING SCALE (HAM-A) AND ZUNG SELF-RATING DEPRESSION SCALE (ZSDS). PERIODONTAL PARAMETERS LIKE PLAQUE INDEX (PI), PROBING POCKET DEPTH (PPD), AND CLINICAL ATTACHMENT LEVEL (CAL) AT 5-8 MM AND >8 MM WERE RECORDED. BLOOD SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED AND SERUM CORTISOL LEVELS WERE MEASURED. RESULTS: MEAN AGE, PLAQUE SCORES, AND NUMBER OF TEETH WITH PPD AND CAL AT 5-8 MM AND >8 MM WERE SIMILAR IN ALL THE GROUPS, EXCEPT BETWEEN GROUP I AND GROUP III WHERE A MULTIPLE COMPARISON WITH TUKEY'S POST-HOC TEST SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN PLAQUE INDEX (P < 0.038) AND THE NUMBER OF TEETH WITH CAL 5-8 MM (P < 0.016). SERUM CORTISOL LEVELS AND HAM-A SCALE AND ZSDS SCORES SHOWED HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT VALUE (P < 0.001) IN GROUP I SUBJECTS WHEN COMPARED WITH GROUP II AND GROUP III SUBJECTS. CONCLUSION: CROSS-SECTIONAL OBSERVATION DONE AMONG THREE GROUPS SHOWED THAT INDIVIDUALS PRACTICING YOGA REGULARLY HAD LOW SERUM CORTISOL LEVELS, HAM-A SCALE AND ZSDS SCORES, AND BETTER PERIODONTAL HEALTH.	2016

AIMS: THE STUDY WAS AIMED TO COMPARE THE THERAPEUTIC EFFECT OF A GENERIC YOGA MODULE WITH ANTIDEPRESSANT DRUGS IN NON-SUICIDAL OUT-PATIENTS OF MAJOR DEPRESSION ATTENDING A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: THE STUDY WAS OUTPATIENT-BASED USING AN OPEN-LABELED DESIGN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 137 OUT-PATIENTS OF DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS RECEIVED ONE OF THE THREE TREATMENTS AS THEY CHOSE - YOGA-ONLY, DRUGS-ONLY OR BOTH. THE YOGA WAS TAUGHT BY A TRAINED YOGA PHYSICIAN FOR OVER A MONTH IN SPACED SESSIONS TOTALING AT LEAST 12. PATIENTS WERE ASSESSED BEFORE TREATMENT, AFTER 1 AND 3 MONTHS ON DEPRESSION AND CLINICAL GLOBAL IMPRESSION SCALES. OUT OF 137, 58 PATIENTS COMPLETED THE STUDY PERIOD WITH ALL ASSESSMENTS. RESULTS: PATIENTS IN THE THREE ARMS OF TREATMENT WERE COMPARABLE ON DEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL VARIABLES. PATIENTS IN ALL THREE ARMS OF TREATMENT OBTAINED A REDUCTION IN DEPRESSION SCORES AS WELL AS CLINICAL SEVERITY. HOWEVER, BOTH YOGA GROUPS (WITH OR WITHOUT DRUGS) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN THE DRUGS-ONLY GROUP. HIGHER PROPORTION OF PATIENTS REMITTED IN THE YOGA GROUPS COMPARED WITH THE DRUGS-ONLY GROUP. NO UNTOWARD EVENTS WERE SPONTANEOUSLY REPORTED IN THE YOGA-TREATED PATIENTS. CONCLUSION: WITHIN THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY, IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT THE FINDINGS SUPPORT A CASE FOR PRESCRIBING YOGA AS TAUGHT IN THE STUDY IN DEPRESSIVE NON-SUICIDAL OUT-PATIENTS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
15 1999  39 STRESS DUE TO EXAMS IN MEDICAL STUDENTS--ROLE OF YOGA. A STUDENT UNDER OPTIMAL STRESS DOES BRING OUT HIS OR HER BEST, HOWEVER EXTREMES OF STRESS CAN RESULT IN STRESS INDUCED DISORDERS AND DETERIORATING PERFORMANCE. CAN YOGA BE OF BENEFIT IN STRESS INDUCED EFFECTS IN MEDICAL STUDENTS? THE PRESENT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN FIRST MBBS STUDENTS (N = 50) TO DETERMINE THE BENEFIT IF ANY OF YOGIC PRACTICES ON ANXIETY STATUS DURING ROUTINE ACTIVITIES AND PRIOR TO EXAMINATION. FEEDBACK SCORES WERE ASSESSED TO DETERMINE HOW THE STUDENTS HAD BENEFITED FROM THE PRACTICES. ANXIETY STATUS AS ASSESSED BY SPILLBERGER'S ANXIETY SCALE SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION FOLLOWING PRACTICE. IN ADDITION THE ANXIETY SCORE WHICH ROSE PRIOR TO EXAMS SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION ON THE DAY OF EXAM AFTER PRACTICE. THESE RESULTS POINT TO THE BENEFICIAL ROLE OF YOGA IN NOT ONLY CAUSING REDUCTION IN BASAL ANXIETY LEVEL BUT ALSO ATTENUATING THE INCREASE IN ANXIETY SCORE IN STRESSFUL STATE SUCH AS EXAMS. THE RESULTS OF THE EXAM INDICATED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN NUMBER OF FAILURES IN YOGA GROUP AS COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. THE IMPROVEMENT IN VARIOUS PARAMETERS SUCH AS BETTER SENSE OF WELL BEING, FEELING OF RELAXATION, IMPROVED CONCENTRATION, SELF CONFIDENCE, IMPROVED EFFICIENCY, GOOD INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIP, INCREASED ATTENTIVENESS, LOWERED IRRITABILITY LEVELS, AND AN OPTIMISTIC OUTLOOK IN LIFE WERE SOME OF THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ENJOYED BY THE YOGA GROUP INDICATED BY FEEDBACK SCORE.	1999	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
16 2474  45 YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT ACTIVITY FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS LEARNING ANATOMY. BACKGROUND: MEDICAL STUDENTS EXPERIENCE HIGH LEVELS OF STRESS DURING TRAINING DUE TO DEMANDING COURSE LOADS WHICH OFTEN LEAVES LESS TIME FOR SELF-CARE. THIS STUDY COMBINES THE SELF-CARE TECHNIQUE OF YOGA WITH LEARNING ANATOMICAL LOCATIONS, INNERVATIONS, ACTIONS, AND FUNCTIONS OF THE MUSCLES AND ORGANS TO DETERMINE IF ANATOMY TESTS SCORES ARE IMPROVED AND WHETHER STUDENTS' STRESS LEVELS ATTENUATE FROM PARTICIPATING IN YOGA. METHODS: IN THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY, 64 STUDENT VOLUNTEERS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO EITHER A YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP OR WAIT LIST CONTROL GROUP THROUGHOUT THE M1 ANATOMY COURSE. THE YOGA GROUP (N = 32) PARTICIPATED IN 8 YOGA SESSIONS SYNCED WITH THE ANATOMY TOPICS THEY WERE LEARNING IN LECTURE. THE WAIT LIST GROUP (N = 32) WENT THROUGH THEIR NORMAL ANATOMY CURRICULUM BUT HAD AN OPTION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SAME YOGA SESSIONS AFTER THE ANATOMY COURSE. THE PRIMARY RESEARCH PURPOSE WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOGA IMPROVED ANATOMY EXAM PERFORMANCE BY COMPARING FOUR ANATOMY EXAM SCORES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. THE SECONDARY RESEARCH PURPOSES INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOGA CLASSES INCLUDING ANATOMY TEACHING STILL CONFERRED ACUTE AND LONG-LASTING STRESS RELIEF BY, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARING A STUDENTS' OWN PRE- AND POST-YOGA STRESS LEVEL AND SELF-PERCEIVED STRESS LEVELS BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS; AND TO DETERMINE IF A STUDENT'S CONFIDENCE IN ANATOMY WAS IMPROVED AFTER A YOGA SESSION. RESULTS: THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN ANATOMY EXAM PERFORMANCE BETWEEN STUDENTS WHO RECEIVED YOGA AND THOSE ON THE WAITLIST (ALL P > 0.05). FOR STUDENTS WHO RECEIVED YOGA, THEIR AVERAGE SELF-REPORTED STRESS LEVELS DECREASED AFTER EACH YOGA SESSION, THEIR AVERAGE DASS (DEPRESSION, ANXIETY AND STRESS SCALE) SCORE DECREASED AFTER A YOGA SESSION, BUT THEY WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY LESS STRESSED THAN THEIR WAITLIST PEERS PRIOR TO AN EXAM, AND THEIR SELF-REPORTED CONFIDENCE IN ANATOMY MATERIAL RELATED TO THE BACK, UPPER EXTREMITY, HEAD AND NECK, AND ABDOMEN/PELVIS INCREASED. CONCLUSION: WITH THIS SAMPLE, THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT YOGA SESSIONS PAIRED WITH ANATOMY LECTURE MATERIAL IMPROVED OVERALL ANATOMY EXAM PERFORMANCE, AS OPPOSED TO ONLY THE MUSCULOSKELETAL PORTION WHICH OTHER STUDIES HAVE LOOKED AT. HOWEVER, YOGA ACUTELY REDUCED STRESS LEVELS, AND SUBJECTIVE FEELINGS OF KNOWLEDGE IMPROVEMENT WERE NOTED BY PARTICIPANTS. BOTH OF THESE CAN PROVIDE BENEFITS TO MEDICAL STUDENTS.	2022

18  723  42 EFFECT OF LAUGHTER YOGA ON MENTAL SYMPTOMS AND SALIVARY CORTISOL LEVELS IN FIRST-YEAR NURSING STUDENTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: UNIVERSITY STUDENTS ARE FACED WITH SEVERAL STRESS FACTORS AFFECTING THEIR MENTAL HEALTH. THEREFORE, THE FIRST YEAR AT UNIVERSITY IS A PERIOD THAT CALLS FOR CAREFUL ATTENTION AND RESEARCH. AIM: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF LAUGHTER YOGA ON MENTAL SYMPTOMS AND CORTISOL LEVELS IN NURSING STUDENTS. METHODS: THIS STUDY IS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY EMPLOYING A PRE-/POST-TEST DESIGN WITH A CONTROL GROUP. A TOTAL OF 75 HEALTHY UNIVERSITY STUDENTS WERE ASSIGNED TO THE INTERVENTION GROUP AND CONTROL GROUP. THE BRIEF SYMPTOM INVENTORY WAS APPLIED TO BOTH GROUPS BEFORE SESSION 1 AND AFTER SESSION 8. SALIVA SAMPLES WERE TAKEN FROM THE STUDENTS TO MEASURE THEIR CORTISOL LEVELS BEFORE AND AFTER EACH SESSION. RESULTS: EVALUATION OF THE MEAN SCORES OBTAINED FROM THE BRIEF SYMPTOM INVENTORY BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE SCORES BETWEEN GROUPS (P < 0.05). IN THREE OUT OF THE EIGHT SESSIONS, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP REGARDING THE MEAN VALUES OF PRE-TEST AND POST-TEST SALIVARY CORTISOL LEVELS (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: LAUGHTER YOGA CAN PROVIDE AN EFFECTIVE MEANS TO HELP FIRST-YEAR NURSING STUDENTS COPE WITH STRESS AND REDUCE MENTAL SYMPTOMS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
19  803  36 EFFECT OF YOGA ON ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE IN RELATION TO STRESS. BACKGROUND: ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE IS CONCERNED WITH THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF LEARNING ATTAINED IN A SUBJECT OR GROUP OF SUBJECTS AFTER A LONG PERIOD OF INSTRUCTION. EXCESSIVE STRESS HAMPERS STUDENTS' PERFORMANCE. IMPROVEMENT IN ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE AND ALERTNESS HAS BEEN REPORTED IN SEVERAL YOGIC STUDIES. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE IN RELATION TO STRESS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE STUDY STARTED WITH 800 ADOLESCENT STUDENTS; 159 HIGH-STRESS STUDENTS AND 142 LOW-STRESS STUDENTS WERE SELECTED ON THE BASIS OF SCORES OBTAINED THROUGH STRESS BATTERY. EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND CONTROL GROUP WERE GIVEN PRE TEST IN THREE SUBJECTS, I.E., MATHEMATICS, SCIENCE, AND SOCIAL STUDIES. A YOGA MODULE CONSISTING OF YOGA ASANAS, PRANAYAMA, MEDITATION, AND A VALUE ORIENTATION PROGRAM WAS ADMINISTERED ON EXPERIMENTAL GROUP FOR 7 WEEKS. THE EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUPS WERE POST-TESTED FOR THEIR PERFORMANCE ON THE THREE SUBJECTS MENTIONED ABOVE. RESULTS: THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE STUDENTS, WHO PRACTICED YOGA PERFORMED BETTER IN ACADEMICS. THE STUDY FURTHER SHOWS THAT LOW-STRESS STUDENTS PERFORMED BETTER THAN HIGH-STRESS STUDENTS, MEANING THEREBY THAT STRESS AFFECTS THE STUDENTS' PERFORMANCE.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
20 2084  46 THE EFFECT OF LAUGHTER YOGA ON GENERAL HEALTH AMONG NURSING STUDENTS. BACKGROUND: PROMOTION AND PROVISION OF INDIVIDUALS' HEALTH IS ONE OF THE BASES FOR DEVELOPMENT IN SOCIETIES. STUDENTS' MENTAL HEALTH IS VERY IMPORTANT IN EACH SOCIETY. STUDENTS OF MEDICAL SCIENCES UNIVERSITIES, ESPECIALLY NURSING STUDENTS, ARE UNDER VARIOUS STRESSES IN CLINICAL ENVIRONMENT, IN ADDITION TO THE STRESS THEY EXPERIENCE IN THEORETICAL EDUCATION ENVIRONMENT. WITH REGARD TO THE IMPORTANCE OF NURSING STUDENTS' GENERAL HEALTH AND CONSIDERING THE VARIOUS EXISTING STRATEGIES TO PROMOTE GENERAL HEALTH COMPONENTS, USE OF COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENTS IS MORE CONSIDERED BECAUSE OF THEIR BETTER PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE, LOW COSTS, AND FEWER COMPLICATIONS. ONE OF THE NEW STRATEGIES IN THIS REGARD IS LAUGHTER YOGA. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED WITH AN AIM TO DEFINE THE EFFECT OF LAUGHTER YOGA ON GENERAL HEALTH AMONG NURSING STUDENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS IS A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL TWO-GROUP THREE-STEP STUDY CONDUCTED ON 38 MALE NURSING STUDENTS IN THE NURSING AND MIDWIFERY SCHOOL OF ISFAHAN UNIVERSITY OF MEDICAL SCIENCES IN 2012. IN THE STUDY GROUP, EIGHT 1 H SESSIONS OF LAUGHTER YOGA WERE HELD (TWO SESSIONS A WEEK), AND IN THE CONTROL GROUP, NO INTERVENTION WAS CONDUCTED. THE DATA OF THE PRESENT STUDY WERE COLLECTED BY GOLDBERG AND HILLER'S GENERAL HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE AND ANALYZED BY SPSS VERSION 12. RESULTS: THE FINDINGS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE MEAN SCORES OF GENERAL HEALTH BEFORE AND AFTER LAUGHTER YOGA INTERVENTION IN THE TWO GROUPS OF STUDY AND CONTROL. CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS SHOWED THAT LAUGHTER YOGA HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON STUDENTS' GENERAL HEALTH AND IMPROVED THE SIGNS OF PHYSICAL AND SLEEP DISORDERS, LOWERED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, AND PROMOTED THEIR SOCIAL FUNCTION. THEREFORE, LAUGHTER YOGA CAN BE USED AS ONE OF THE EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES ON STUDENTS' GENERAL HEALTH.	2014

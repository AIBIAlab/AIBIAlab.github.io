1  145 144 A QUALITATIVE EVALUATION OF STUDENT LEARNING AND SKILLS USE IN A SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PROGRAM. PREVIOUS STUDIES ON SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PROGRAMS HAVE FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON QUANTITATIVE MEASUREMENT OF PROGRAM OUTCOMES. THIS STUDY USED QUALITATIVE DATA TO INVESTIGATE PROGRAM CONTENT AND SKILLS THAT STUDENTS REMEMBERED AND APPLIED IN THEIR DAILY LIVES. DATA WERE GATHERED FOLLOWING A 16-WEEK MINDFULNESS AND YOGA INTERVENTION DELIVERED AT THREE URBAN SCHOOLS BY A COMMUNITY NON-PROFIT ORGANIZATION. WE CONDUCTED FOCUS GROUPS AND INTERVIEWS WITH NINE CLASSROOM TEACHERS WHO DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM AND HELD SIX FOCUS GROUPS WITH 22 FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADE PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS. THIS STUDY ADDRESSES TWO PRIMARY RESEARCH QUESTIONS: (1) WHAT SKILLS DID STUDENTS LEARN, RETAIN, AND UTILIZE OUTSIDE THE PROGRAM? AND (2) WHAT CHANGES DID CLASSROOM TEACHERS EXPECT AND OBSERVE AMONG PROGRAM RECIPIENTS? FOUR MAJOR THEMES RELATED TO SKILL LEARNING AND APPLICATION EMERGED AS FOLLOWS: (1) YOUTHS RETAINED AND UTILIZED PROGRAM SKILLS INVOLVING BREATH WORK AND POSES; (2) KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HEALTH BENEFITS OF THESE TECHNIQUES PROMOTED SELF-UTILIZATION AND SHARING OF SKILLS; (3) YOUTHS DEVELOPED KEENER EMOTIONAL APPRAISAL THAT, COUPLED WITH NEW AND IMPROVED EMOTIONAL REGULATION SKILLS, HELPED DE-ESCALATE NEGATIVE EMOTIONS, PROMOTE CALM, AND REDUCE STRESS; AND (4) YOUTHS AND TEACHERS REPORTED REALISTIC AND OPTIMISTIC EXPECTATIONS FOR FUTURE IMPACT OF ACQUIRED PROGRAM SKILLS. WE DISCUSS IMPLICATIONS OF THESE FINDINGS FOR GUIDING FUTURE RESEARCH AND PRACTICE.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
2   18  55 "THE PROGRAM AFFECTS ME 'CAUSE IT GIVES AWAY STRESS": URBAN STUDENTS' QUALITATIVE PERSPECTIVES ON STRESS AND A SCHOOL-BASED MINDFUL YOGA INTERVENTION. CONTEXT: SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA STUDIES GENERALLY MEASURE STRESS-RELATED OUTCOMES USING QUANTITATIVE MEASURES. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY ANSWERS THE FOLLOWING RESEARCH QUESTIONS: HOW DO YOUTH DEFINE STRESS AND IN WHAT WAYS, IF ANY, WAS A MINDFUL YOGA INTERVENTION HELPFUL TO YOUTH DURING STRESS EXPERIENCES? DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: TO EXPLORE YOUTHS' OWN PERSPECTIVES ON STRESS, STRESSORS IN YOUTHS' LIVES, AND PERCEIVED CHANGES IN RESPONSES TO STRESS POST-INTERVENTION, WE CONDUCTED FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS WITH 22 MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS FROM LOW-INCOME URBAN COMMUNITIES FOLLOWING A 16-WEEK MINDFUL YOGA INTERVENTION. RESULTS: USING THEMATIC ANALYSIS, THE FOLLOWING THREE THEMES EMERGED: (1) YOUTH CONFLATED STRESS WITH NEGATIVE EMOTIONS; (2) PEER AND FAMILY CONFLICTS WERE COMMON STRESSORS; AND (3) YOUTH REPORTED IMPROVED IMPULSE CONTROL AND EMOTIONAL REGULATION FOLLOWING THE INTERVENTION. STUDY FINDINGS HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR REFINING INTERVENTION CONTENT (E.G., DISCUSSIONS OF STRESS), AS WELL AS INFORMING THE SELECTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF QUANTITATIVE MEASURES FOR FUTURE RESEARCH ON STRESS AND STRESS RESPONSES IN URBAN YOUTH.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
3 2686  28 YOGA IN THE SCHOOLS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO EXAMINE THE EVIDENCE FOR DELIVERING YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS IN SCHOOLS. METHODS: AN ELECTRONIC LITERATURE SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY PEER-REVIEWED, PUBLISHED STUDIES IN WHICH YOGA AND A MEDITATIVE COMPONENT (BREATHING PRACTICES OR MEDITATION) WERE TAUGHT TO YOUTHS IN A SCHOOL SETTING. PILOT STUDIES, SINGLE COHORT, QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL, AND RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS WERE CONSIDERED. RESEARCH: QUALITY WAS EVALUATED AND SUMMARIZED. RESULTS: TWELVE PUBLISHED STUDIES WERE IDENTIFIED. SAMPLES FOR WHICH YOGA WAS IMPLEMENTED AS AN INTERVENTION INCLUDED YOUTHS WITH AUTISM, INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY, LEARNING DISABILITY, AND EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE, AS WELL AS TYPICALLY DEVELOPING YOUTHS. CONCLUSION: ALTHOUGH EFFECTS OF PARTICIPATING IN SCHOOL-BASED YOGA PROGRAMS APPEARED TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR THE MOST PART, METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING LACK OF RANDOMIZATION, SMALL SAMPLES, LIMITED DETAIL REGARDING THE INTERVENTION, AND STATISTICAL AMBIGUITIES CURTAILED THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE DEFINITIVE CONCLUSIONS OR RECOMMENDATIONS. FINDINGS SPEAK TO THE NEED FOR GREATER METHODOLOGICAL RIGOR AND AN INCREASED UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISMS OF SUCCESS FOR SCHOOL-BASED YOGA INTERVENTIONS.	2012

5 1629  27 MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA FOR YOUTH WITH PERSISTENT CONCUSSION: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: WE EXPLORED THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA (MBY) FOR YOUTH WITH PERSISTENT CONCUSSION BY EXAMINING OCCUPATION-BASED AND NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL OUTCOMES. METHOD: IN THIS CASE SERIES DESIGN STUDY, 6 YOUTHS AGES 13-17 YR WITH CONCUSSION SYMPTOMS FOR >4 WK PARTICIPATED IN AN 8-WK MBY INTERVENTION, 1X/WK FOR 45 MIN. PARTICIPATION, SELF-EFFICACY, AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY (24 HR) WERE COLLECTED BEFORE, AFTER, AND 3 MO AFTER THE INTERVENTION. HEART RATE VARIABILITY WAS ALSO MEASURED DURING EACH SESSION. RESULTS: TRENDS OF INCREASED SELF-EFFICACY IN ACADEMIC, SOCIAL, AND EMOTIONAL DOMAINS WERE FOUND AFTER MBY AND MAINTAINED AT 3-MO FOLLOW-UP. TRENDS OF INCREASING HEART RATE VARIABILITY WERE ALSO FOUND PRE- TO POSTINTERVENTION AND WITHIN THE EIGHT MBY SESSIONS. CONCLUSION: PRELIMINARY RESULTS REVEAL POSITIVE TRENDS AFTER A NOVEL, SAFE INTERVENTION FOR YOUTH WITH PERSISTENT CONCUSSION SYMPTOMS AND THE VALUE OF EXPLORING BOTH OCCUPATION-BASED AND NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES. FUTURE RESEARCH WITH A LARGER SAMPLE AND CONTROL GROUP IS WARRANTED.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
6  347  29 ASSESSING FIDELITY OF IMPLEMENTATION (FOI) FOR SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA INTERVENTIONS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. AS SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PROGRAMS GAIN POPULARITY, THE SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF FIDELITY OF PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION (FOI) IS CRITICAL TO PROVIDE A MORE ROBUST UNDERSTANDING OF THE CORE COMPONENTS OF MINDFULNESS AND YOGA INTERVENTIONS, THEIR POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE SPECIFIED TEACHER AND STUDENT OUTCOMES, AND OUR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT THESE PROGRAMS CONSISTENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY. THIS PAPER REVIEWS THE CURRENT STATE OF THE SCIENCE WITH RESPECT TO INCLUSION AND REPORTING OF FOI IN PEER-REVIEWED STUDIES EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND/OR YOGA PROGRAMS TARGETING STUDENTS AND/OR TEACHERS IMPLEMENTED IN GRADES KINDERGARTEN THROUGH TWELVE (K-12) IN NORTH AMERICA. ELECTRONIC SEARCHES IN PSYCHINFO AND WEB OF SCIENCE FROM THEIR INCEPTION THROUGH MAY 2014, IN ADDITION TO HAND SEARCHES OF RELEVANT REVIEW ARTICLES, IDENTIFIED 312 PUBLICATIONS, 48 OF WHICH MET INCLUSION CRITERIA. FINDINGS INDICATED A RELATIVE PAUCITY OF RIGOROUS FOI. FEWER THAN 10% OF STUDIES OUTLINED POTENTIAL CORE PROGRAM COMPONENTS OR REFERENCED A FORMAL THEORY OF ACTION, AND FEWER THAN 20% ASSESSED ANY ASPECT OF FOI BEYOND PARTICIPANT DOSAGE. THE EMERGING NATURE OF THE EVIDENCE BASE PROVIDES A CRITICAL WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY TO GRAPPLE WITH KEY ISSUES RELEVANT TO FOI OF MINDFULNESS-BASED AND YOGA PROGRAMS, INCLUDING IDENTIFYING ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT SHOULD BE FAITHFULLY IMPLEMENTED AND HOW WE MIGHT DEVELOP RIGOROUS MEASURES TO ACCURATELY CAPTURE THEM. CONSIDERATION OF THESE QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTED NEXT STEPS ARE INTENDED TO HELP ADVANCE THE EMERGING FIELD OF SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA INTERVENTIONS.	2016

THE STORIES OF BOTH INTERVIEWEES REFLECT THE VALUE AND POTENTIAL POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA PROGRAMMING WITHIN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SETTINGS AND SUGGEST THE NEED FOR SUSTAINED PROGRAMMING AND ONGOING EMPIRICAL EVALUATION.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
8 1954  25 SECULARITY: GUIDING QUESTIONS FOR INCLUSIVE YOGA IN SCHOOLS. THIS COMMENTARY EXPLORES THE LEGAL AND ETHICAL OBLIGATIONS OF YOGA PROGRAMS AND TEACHERS TO UPHOLD BOTH THE PRINCIPLES AND THE SPIRIT OF SECULARISM WHEN TEACHING YOGA IN SCHOOLS. ARGUING THAT SECULARITY IS ESSENTIAL BOTH TO COMPLY WITH LEGAL MANDATES AND TO MAXIMIZE INCLUSIVITY AND ACCESS, EACH FACET OF A SECULAR APPROACH TO YOGA IN SCHOOLS IS EXPLORED THROUGH AN INQUIRY-BASED MODEL MEANT TO HELP THE READER GAIN CLARITY AND MAKE INFORMED CHOICES WHEN DEVELOPING SCHOOL-BASED YOGA PROGRAMMING. THIS ARTICLE DOES NOT ADDRESS THE USE OF NONSECULAR YOGA FOR CHILDREN OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL SETTING. IT INSTEAD SPEAKS TO THE COMPLEXITIES OF TOPICS SUCH AS SPIRITUALITY, PERSONAL TRANSFORMATION, SECULAR ETHICS, AND THE USE OF CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL ARTIFACTS WITHIN SCHOOL PROGRAMS. WHILE INVITING CONTINUED REFLECTION ON THE NUANCES OF THE TOPIC, THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES THAT GIVEN BOTH THE LEGAL IMPERATIVES AND POTENTIAL RISK OF EXCLUSION, FAILURE TO OFFER SCHOOL-BASED YOGA USING A SECULAR APPROACH THREATENS TO UNDERMINE THE SUCCESS OF THE FIELD AND HINDER ACCESS TO PRACTICES THAT HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON YOUNG PEOPLE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
9  126  40 A PILOT STUDY TO ADAPT A TRAUMA-INFORMED, MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION FOR JUSTICE-INVOLVED YOUTH. THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO ADAPT AND PILOT A TRAUMA-INFORMED, MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA (TIMBY) INTERVENTION FOCUSED ON ENHANCING SELF-REGULATION AMONG YOUTH IN THE GEORGIA DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. IN THIS ARTICLE WE (1) DESCRIBE THE PROCESS BY WHICH WE SYSTEMATICALLY ADAPTED AN EVIDENCE-BASED PROTOCOL SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS POPULATION, (2) DESCRIBE THE NATURE OF AND RATIONALE FOR THOSE ADAPTATIONS, (3) PRESENT SOME PRELIMINARY QUALITATIVE FINDINGS BASED ON INTERVIEWS WITH YOUTH PARTICIPANTS, AND (4) BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE HOW THE ADAPTED PROTOCOL WILL BE EVALUATED IN THE SUBSEQUENT FEASIBILITY TRIAL. THE ITERATIVE DRAFTING AND REVISION PROCESS INVOLVED MODIFICATIONS TO A WELL-ESTABLISHED, PROTOCOLIZED TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA PROGRAM AND WAS IDENTIFIED BY THE PROJECT ADVISORY BOARD AND T H ROUGH FORMAL INTERVIEWS WITH INTERVENTION STAFF. QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH YOUTH PARTICIPANTS CONCERNING INTERVENTION IMPACT, CREDIBILITY, AND SATISFACTION. SEVERAL NEEDED MODIFICATIONS WERE IDENTIFIED SO THAT THE INTERVENTION WOULD BE CONTEXTUALLY APPROPRIATE FOR JUSTICE-INVOLVED YOUTH. THIRTY YOUTH WERE ENROLLED IN THE PILOT STUDY: 77% WE RE NON - HISPANIC BLACK/AFRICAN-AMERICAN, 18% WERE NON-HISPANIC WHITE, AND 5% WERE HISPANIC WHITE. THE AVERAGE AGE WAS 16.45 YEARS (RANGE 14-20). THE YOUTH CONSISTENTLY REPORTED SATISFACTION WITH THE SESSIONS AND POSITIVE BELIEFS ABOUT HOW THE SESSIONS WERE HELPING THEM WITH A RANGE OF PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL/ EMOTIONAL CHALLENGES. ADAPTATIONS TO THE PROTOCOL IN THE PRESENT STUDY HIGHLIGHT HOW MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR JUSTICE-INVOLVED YOUTH NEED TO CONSIDER WHAT IS BOTH DEVELOPMENTALLY SUITABLE FOR YOUTH AND APPROPRIATE IN A JUSTICE SETTING. A FEASIBILITY STUDY USING THIS REVISED TIMBY PROTOCOL IS UNDERWAY AT FOUR GEORGIA DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE FACILITIES TO FORMALLY IDENTIFY THE BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO IMPLEMENTATION FOR THE PRESENT STUDY AND A FUTURE, LARGER-SCALE TRIAL.	2021	

10 1493  30 INTERPRETIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF A LAWSUIT CONTENDING THAT SCHOOL-BASED YOGA IS RELIGION: A STUDY OF SCHOOL PERSONNEL. THIS STUDY FOCUSED ON THE PERSPECTIVES OF SCHOOL PERSONNEL AFFILIATED WITH THE ENCINITAS UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA FOLLOWING A LAWSUIT ARGUING THAT THEIR YOGA-BASED PROGRAM INCLUDED RELIGION AND THEREFORE WAS UNSUITABLE FOR IMPLEMENTATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. PARTICIPANTS (N = 32) WERE INTERVIEWED USING A SEMISTRUCTURED INTERVIEW, AND DATA WERE ANALYZED ACCORDING TO INTERPRETATIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL ANALYSIS. FIVE SUPER-ORDINATE THEMES (INCLUDING SUB-THEMES) WERE IDENTIFIED IN AN ITERATIVE PROCESS, INCLUDING: PARTICIPANTS' PERSPECTIVES ON THE ROOTS OF YOGA AND THE TYPE OF YOGA TAUGHT IN THEIR DISTRICT; THE PROCESS OF INTRODUCING A YOGA-IN-THE-SCHOOLS PROGRAM IN LIGHT OF THIS CONTENTION (INCLUDING CHALLENGES AND OBSTACLES, AND HOW THESE WERE MET); PERSPECTIVES ON THE LAWSUIT AND HOW THE PROCESS UNFOLDED; EFFECTS OF THE LAWSUIT ON SCHOOL CLIMATE AND BEYOND; AND PERSPECTIVES ON YOGA AS, AND AS NOT, RELIGIOUS. THE STUDY ATTEMPTS TO SHED LIGHT ON THE IMPACT OF AN ONGOING LAWSUIT ON A SCHOOL DISTRICT AT THE TIME OF IMPLEMENTATION OF A PROGRAM FOR STUDENTS' WELL BEING.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
11 2239  22 THE IMPORTANCE OF RESEARCH LITERACY FOR YOGA THERAPISTS. EVIDENCE-INFORMED PRACTICE (EIP) UTILIZES THE THREE COMPONENTS OF EXPERT OPINION, RESEARCH EVIDENCE, AND CLIENT VALUES. IT IS A RECOMMENDED TRAINING COMPETENCY FOR INTEGRATIVE HEALTH PRACTITIONERS IN DIVERSE FIELDS, SUCH AS ACUPUNCTURE AND MASSAGE THERAPY. RESEARCH LITERACY (RL) IS A NECESSARY PRE-REQUISITE TO EIP. MANY YOGA THERAPISTS HAVE LIMITED TRAINING IN THESE SKILLS, WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTS INTER-PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION, AS WELL AS FURTHER ADVANCEMENT OF YOGA THERAPY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE PROPOSE INCLUSION OF RL AND EIP IN THE TRAINING OF YOGA THERAPISTS. BENEFITS FOR CLIENT CARE, COLLABORATIVE CARE, AND THE FIELD OF YOGA THERAPY ARE DISCUSSED.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
12 2024  24 SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR ANXIETY REDUCTION AMONG CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS. OBJECTIVE: ANXIETY DISORDERS ARE THE MOST PREVALENT PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS AMONG CHILDREN AND YOUTHS. THERE IS GROWING INTEREST IN INTERVENTION OPTIONS FOR ANXIETY. YOGA IS WIDELY USED IN CLINICAL, SCHOOL, AND COMMUNITY SETTINGS, BUT CONSOLIDATED SOURCES OUTLINING ITS EFFECTIVENESS IN REDUCING ANXIETY ARE LIMITED. METHOD: THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW EXAMINED THE EVIDENCE BASE (1990-2014) FOR YOGA INTERVENTIONS ADDRESSING ANXIETY AMONG CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS (AGES 3-18 YR). RESULTS: WE IDENTIFIED 2,147 REFERENCES AND FOUND 80 ARTICLES THAT WERE ELIGIBLE FOR FULL-TEXT REVIEW. THE FINAL ANALYSIS INCLUDED 16: 6 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS, 2 NONRANDOMIZED PREINTERVENTION-POSTINTERVENTION CONTROL-GROUP DESIGNS, 7 UNCONTROLLED PREINTERVENTION-POSTINTERVENTION STUDIES, AND 1 CASE STUDY. CONCLUSION: NEARLY ALL STUDIES INDICATED REDUCED ANXIETY AFTER A YOGA INTERVENTION. HOWEVER, BECAUSE OF THE WIDE VARIETY OF STUDY POPULATIONS, LIMITATIONS IN SOME STUDY DESIGNS, AND VARIABLE OUTCOME MEASURES, FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO ENHANCE THE ABILITY TO GENERALIZE AND APPLY YOGA TO REDUCE ANXIETY.	2015

THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE LIFESTYLE AND SOCIAL STRUCTURE OF A YOGA ASHRAM AND DESCRIBES HOW THEY FACILITATE PROCESSES WHERE RESIDENTS LEARN TO RELEASE AND PREVENT STRESS IN THEIR LIVES.	1985	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
14  118  28 A PILOT STUDY OF IYENGAR YOGA FOR PEDIATRIC OBESITY: EFFECTS ON GAIT AND EMOTIONAL FUNCTIONING. OBESITY NEGATIVELY IMPACTS THE KINEMATICS AND KINETICS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITIES IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS. ALTHOUGH YOGA HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE SEVERAL DISTINCT BENEFITS FOR CHILDREN WITH OBESITY, THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY TO EXAMINE THE BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR GAIT (PRIMARY OUTCOME) IN YOUTHS WITH OBESITY. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL), PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND PAIN. FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY WERE ALSO ASSESSED. NINE YOUTHS (11(-)17 YEARS) PARTICIPATED IN AN EIGHT-WEEK IYENGAR YOGA INTERVENTION (BI-WEEKLY 1-H CLASSES). GAIT, HRQOL (SELF AND PARENT-PROXY REPORTS), AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND POST-YOGA. PAIN WAS SELF-REPORTED AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH CLASS. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE FOUND IN MULTIPLE GAIT PARAMETERS, INCLUDING HIP, KNEE, AND ANKLE MOTION AND MOMENTS. SELF-REPORTED AND PARENT-PROXY REPORTS OF EMOTIONAL FUNCTIONING SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED. TIME SPENT IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND WEIGHT DID NOT CHANGE. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT A RELATIVELY BRIEF, NON-INVASIVE IYENGAR YOGA INTERVENTION CAN RESULT IN IMPROVED MALALIGNMENT OF THE LOWER EXTREMITIES DURING AMBULATION, AS WELL AS IN CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL IMPROVEMENTS IN EMOTIONAL FUNCTIONING. THIS STUDY EXTENDS CURRENT EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTS A ROLE FOR YOGA IN PEDIATRIC OBESITY.	2018

16  148  39 A QUALITATIVE EXPLORATION OF IMPLEMENTATION FACTORS IN A SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PROGRAM: LESSONS LEARNED FROM STUDENTS AND TEACHERS. IDENTIFYING FACTORS RELEVANT FOR SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF SCHOOL-BASED INTERVENTIONS IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THAT PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED IN AN EFFECTIVE AND ENGAGING MANNER. THE PERSPECTIVES OF TWO KEY STAKEHOLDERS CRITICAL FOR IDENTIFYING IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS - STUDENTS AND THEIR CLASSROOM TEACHERS - MERIT ATTENTION IN THIS CONTEXT AND HAVE RARELY BEEN EXPLORED USING QUALITATIVE METHODS. THIS STUDY REPORTS QUALITATIVE PERSPECTIVES OF FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADE PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR TEACHERS OF A 16-WEEK SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PROGRAM IN THREE PUBLIC SCHOOLS SERVING LOW-INCOME URBAN COMMUNITIES. FOUR THEMES RELATED TO PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS EMERGED: PROGRAM DELIVERY FACTORS, PROGRAM BUY-IN, IMPLEMENTER COMMUNICATION WITH TEACHERS, AND INSTRUCTOR QUALITIES. FEEDBACK FROM STUDENTS AND TEACHERS IS DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT OF INFORMING IMPLEMENTATION, ADAPTATION, AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PROGRAMMING IN URBAN SETTINGS.	2017

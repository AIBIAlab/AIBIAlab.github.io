1 2155 145 THE EFFECTS OF THE BALI YOGA PROGRAM (BYP-BC) ON REDUCING PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY: RESULTS OF A RANDOMIZED, PARTIALLY BLINDED, CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND SEVERAL COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO REDUCE PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS IN BREAST CANCER (BC) PATIENTS. THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA INTERVENTION IN REDUCING DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IN BC PATIENTS. METHODS THIS STUDY WAS A RANDOMIZED, PARTIALLY BLINDED, CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING A STANDARDIZED YOGA INTERVENTION TO STANDARD CARE. IT WAS CONDUCTED AT THREE MEDICAL CENTERS IN MONTREAL, CANADA. ELIGIBLE PATIENTS WERE WOMEN DIAGNOSED WITH STAGE I-III BC RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO RECEIVE YOGA INTERVENTION IMMEDIATELY (EXPERIMENTAL GROUP, N=58) OR AFTER A WAITING PERIOD (N=43 CONTROL GROUP). THE BALI YOGA PROGRAM FOR BREAST CANCER PATIENTS (BYP-BC) CONSISTED OF 23 GENTLE HATHA ASANAS (POSES), 2 PRAYANAMAS (BREATHING TECHNIQUES), SHAVASANAS (RELAXATION CORPSE POSES) AND PSYCHOEDUCATIONAL THEMES. PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED EIGHT WEEKLY SESSIONS LASTING 90 MIN EACH AND RECEIVED A DVD FOR HOME PRACTICE WITH 20- AND 40-MIN SESSIONS. PARTICIPANTS IN THE WAIT LIST CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED STANDARD CARE DURING THE 8-WEEK WAITING PERIOD. RESULTS A TOTAL OF 101 PARTICIPANTS TOOK PART IN THE FINAL INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSES. THE REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSES DEMONSTRATED THAT DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS INCREASED IN THE CONTROL GROUP (P=0.007), WHILE NO CHANGE WAS REPORTED IN THE BYP-BC GROUP (P=0.29). ALSO, DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS DECREASED IN THE WL CONTROL GROUP AFTER RECEIVING THE BYP-BC INTERVENTION (P=0.03). FINALLY, THERE WAS NO STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE IN TERMS OF ANXIETY SYMPTOMS (P=0.10). CONCLUSIONS RESULTS SUPPORT THE BYP-BC INTERVENTION AS A BENEFICIAL MEANS OF REDUCING AND PREVENTING THE WORSENING OF DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS DURING CHEMOTHERAPY TREATMENT.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
2   97  30 A NONRANDOMIZED COMPARISON STUDY OF SELF-HYPNOSIS, YOGA, AND COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY TO REDUCE EMOTIONAL DISTRESS IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. THE AUTHORS ASKED BREAST CANCER (BC) PATIENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN 1 OF 3 MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS (COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT), YOGA, OR SELF-HYPNOSIS) TO EXPLORE THEIR FEASIBILITY, EASE OF COMPLIANCE, AND IMPACT ON THE PARTICIPANTS' DISTRESS, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), SLEEP, AND MENTAL ADJUSTMENT. NINETY-NINE PATIENTS COMPLETED AN INTERVENTION (CBT: N = 10; YOGA: N = 21; AND SELF-HYPNOSIS: N = 68). RESULTS SHOWED HIGH FEASIBILITY AND HIGH COMPLIANCE. AFTER THE INTERVENTIONS, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT IN THE CBT GROUP BUT SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECTS ON DISTRESS IN THE YOGA AND SELF-HYPNOSIS GROUPS, AND, ALSO, ON QOL, SLEEP, AND MENTAL ADJUSTMENT IN THE SELF-HYPNOSIS GROUP. IN CONCLUSION, MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS CAN DECREASE DISTRESS IN BC PATIENTS, BUT RCTS ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE FINDINGS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
3 1056  47 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY OF WOMEN. UNLABELLED: YOGA HAS OFTEN BEEN PERCEIVED AS A METHOD OF STRESS MANAGEMENT TOOL THAT CAN ASSIST IN ALLEVIATING DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY DISORDERS. THIS STUDY SOUGHT TO EVALUATE THE INFLUENCE OF YOGA IN RELIEVING SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY IN WOMEN WHO WERE REFERRED TO A YOGA CLINIC. METHODS: THE STUDY INVOLVED A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF WOMEN WHO WERE REFERRED TO A YOGA CLINIC FROM JULY 2006 TO JULY 2007. ALL NEW CASES WERE EVALUATED ON ADMISSION USING A PERSONAL INFORMATION QUESTIONNAIRE WELL AS BECK AND SPIELBERGER TESTS. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED INTO AN EXPERIMENTAL AND A CONTROL GROUP. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (N=34) PARTICIPATED IN TWICE WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES OF 90 MIN DURATION FOR TWO MONTHS. THE CONTROL GROUP (N=31) WAS ASSIGNED TO A WAITING LIST AND DID NOT RECEIVE YOGA. BOTH GROUPS WERE EVALUATED AGAIN AFTER THE TWO-MONTH STUDY PERIOD. RESULTS: THE AVERAGE PREVALENCE OF DEPRESSION IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PRE AND POST YOGA INTERVENTION WAS 12.82+/-7.9 AND 10.79+/-6.04 RESPECTIVELY, A STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT DECREASE (P=0.13). HOWEVER, WHEN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP, WOMEN WHO PARTICIPATED IN YOGA CLASSES SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN STATE ANXIETY (P=0.03) AND TRAIT ANXIETY (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: PARTICIPATION IN A TWO-MONTH YOGA CLASS CAN LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PERCEIVED LEVELS OF ANXIETY IN WOMEN WHO SUFFER FROM ANXIETY DISORDERS. THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT YOGA CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY OR AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD FOR MEDICAL THERAPY IN THE TREATMENT OF ANXIETY DISORDERS.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
4 2896  40 [EFFECT OF YOGA ON CANCER RELATED FATIGUE IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WITH CHEMOTHERAPY]. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE CONDITION OF CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (CRF) IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WITH CHEMOTHERAPY AND TO EXPLORE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON IT. METHODS: AFTER THE COMPLETION OF YOGA, 100 BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WITH CRF (CFS>0) WERE SELECTED AND WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO THE YOGA GROUP AND THE CONTROL GROUP (N=50). PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP ONLY RECEIVED ROUTINE CURE AND CARE WHILE PATIENTS IN THE YOGA GROUP RECEIVED EXTRA YOGA EXERCISE, LASTING FOR 4 MONTHS. CANCER FATIGUE SCALE (CFS) WAS EVALUATED IN THE 2ND, 4TH AND 6TH ROUND OF CHEMOTHERAPY. RESULTS: AT THE END, 82 CASES QUALIFIED FOR THE STUDY, 42 CASES FOR THE CONTROL GROUP AND 40 FOR THE YOGA GROUP. THE MEAN SCORE OF BODY FATIGUE WAS 12.67+/-3.46. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN CRF BETWEEN THE YAGO GROUP AND THE CONTROL GROUP BEFORE THE YOGA INTERVENTION (P>0.05). AFTER THE 4TH ROUND OF CHEMOTHERAPY, THE MEAN SCORES OF CFS AND BODY FATIGUE IN THE YOGA GROUP WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THAT IN THE CONTROL GROUP (P<0.05). AFTER THE 6TH ROUND OF CHEMOTHERAPY, THE MEAN SCORES OF CFS, BODY FATIGUE AND COGNITIVE FATIGUE IN THE YOGA GROUP WERE LOWER THAN THAT IN THE CONTROL GROUP (P<0.05). REPEATED ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE SHOWED THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN THE OVERALL FATIGUE, BODY FATIGUE AND COGNITIVE FATIGUE BETWEEN THE YOGA GROUP AND THE CONTROL GROUP WAS SIGNIFICANT (P<0.05); THE TIME INFLUENCE ON THE OVERALL FATIGUE, BODY FATIGUE AND EMOTIONAL FATIGUE WAS SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE 2 GROUPS (P<0.05); THERE WERE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE EFFECT OF YAGO AND TIME ON THE OVERALL FATIGUE, BODY FATIGUE AND COGNITIVE FATIGUE (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: THE BODY FATIGUE WAS MORE SERIOUS IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WITH CHEMOTHERAPY. YOGA INTERVENTION COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE BODY FATIGUE, COGNITIVE FATIGUE, THUS REDUCE THE OVERALL FATIGUE IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WITH CHEMOTHERAPY.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
5 1245  47 FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING A COMMUNITY-BASED RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF YOGA FOR WOMEN UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY FOR BREAST CANCER. BACKGROUND: TREATMENT-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND DECREASED HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) FREQUENTLY OCCUR DURING CHEMOTHERAPY FOR BREAST CANCER. ALTHOUGH RESEARCH FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA CAN REDUCE SYMPTOMS AND IMPROVE HRQOL AFTER TREATMENT, POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA DURING CHEMOTHERAPY HAVE RECEIVED MINIMAL ATTENTION. OBJECTIVE: TO ESTIMATE ACCRUAL, ADHERENCE, STUDY RETENTION, AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF A YOGA INTERVENTION COMPARED WITH AN ACTIVE CONTROL GROUP FOR BREAST CANCER PATIENTS DURING CHEMOTHERAPY. METHODS: WOMEN WITH STAGE I-III BREAST CANCER WERE RECRUITED FROM 3 COMMUNITY CANCER CLINICS AND RANDOMIZED TO 10 WEEKS OF GENTLE YOGA OR WELLNESS EDUCATION. DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, FATIGUE, SLEEP, AND HRQOL WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE, MID-INTERVENTION (WEEK 5), AND AFTER INTERVENTION (WEEK 10). RESULTS: 40 WOMEN AGED 29-83 YEARS (MEDIAN, 48 YEARS; 88% WHITE) WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA (N = 22) OR WELLNESS EDUCATION (N = 18). THE GROUPS DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY ON BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS, ADHERENCE, OR STUDY RETENTION. PARTICIPANT FEEDBACK WAS POSITIVE AND COMPARABLE BETWEEN GROUPS. MEANINGFUL WITHIN-GROUP DIFFERENCES WERE IDENTIFIED FOR SLEEP ADEQUACY AND QUANTITY IN YOGA PARTICIPANTS AND FOR SOMNOLENCE IN WELLNESS-EDUCATION PARTICIPANTS. LIMITATIONS: SMALL SAMPLE SIZE AND LACK OF A USUAL-CARE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY ESTABLISHED FEASIBILITY OF A COMMUNITY-BASED RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF YOGA AND AN ACTIVE COMPARISON GROUP FOR WOMEN UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY FOR BREAST CANCER. PRELIMINARY EFFICACY ESTIMATES SUGGEST THAT YOGA IMPROVES SLEEP ADEQUACY SYMPTOM SEVERITY AND INTERFERENCE REMAINED STABLE DURING CHEMOTHERAPY FOR THE YOGA GROUP AND SNOWED A TREND TOWARD INCREASING IN THE CONTROL GROUP. THE STUDY HIGHLIGHTED OBSTACLES TO MULTISITE YOGA RESEARCH DURING CANCER TREATMENT.

6 1046  44 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION FOR HIGH RISK MOTHERS ON HOSPITAL BEDREST. BACKGROUND: AND PURPOSE: IN RECENT YEARS, YOGA PRACTITIONERS HAVE JOINED FORCES WITH MEDICAL PROGRAMS TO APPROACH PATIENTS' WELL-BEING HOLISTICALLY. THIS STUDY IS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF A SPECIALIZED ADAPTED YOGA PROGRAM ON ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION FOR HIGH-RISK EXPECTANT MOTHERS ON BEDREST IN A HOSPITAL SETTING. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SEVENTY-NINE PREGNANT SUBJECTS ON PHYSICIAN ORDERED HOSPITALIZED BEDREST WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS: RECEIVING BIWEEKLY YOGA SESSIONS (INTERVENTION GROUP) OR RECEIVING NO YOGA (CONTROL GROUP). DATA COLLECTION TOOL WAS THE HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE (HADS) TO ASSESS OUTCOMES AFTER DELIVERY. RESULTS: YOGA, EVEN AS LITTLE AS THREE SESSIONS, SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN REDUCING ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION HIGH-RISK PREGNANT WOMEN ON HOSPITALIZED BEDREST. PERCEIVED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION OVERALL SCORES WERE LOWER IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP THAN IN THE CONTROL GROUP (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THAT YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION TO DECREASE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION IN HIGH-RISK ANTEPARTUM WOMEN ON HOSPITALIZED BEDREST.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
7  657  29 EFFECT OF 'EXERCISE WITHOUT MOVEMENT' YOGA METHOD ON MINDFULNESS, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. OBJECTIVE: TO ANALYZE THE EFFECT OF THE 'EXERCISE WITHOUT MOVEMENT' (E.W.M) YOGA METHOD ON MINDFULNESS AND ON THE IMPROVEMENT OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS. METHODS: A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY EXAMINED THE EFFECT OF ONE MONTH E.W.M. INTERVENTION AMONG 38 PARTICIPANTS WHO WERE ENROLLED VOLUNTARILY TO BOTH GROUPS, STUDY (N = 16) AND CONTROL (N = 22). FIVE PARTICIPANTS DROPPED OUT DURING THE STUDY. THE STATE MINDFULNESS SCALE (SMS) WAS USED TO MEASURE MINDFULNESS. THE ANXIETY INVENTORY BECK (BAI) AND THE BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY (BDI-II) WERE USED TO MEASURE THE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS, RESPECTIVELY, BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION. RESULTS: STUDY GROUP SHOWED BOTH A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN MINDFULNESS AND DECREASE IN ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS, COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: THE E.W.M. HAS BEEN USEFUL IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MINDFULNESS AND IN THE TREATMENT OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AND MAY REPRESENT A NEW METHOD IN THE MINDFULNESS-BASED THERAPEUTIC APPLICATION.	2016

THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT PILOT STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFITS AFFORDED BY A 7-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM FOR CANCER SURVIVORS. METHOD: ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS (PER-SCREENED WITH PAR-Q/PAR-MED-X) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER THE INTERVENTION (N=20) OR CONTROL GROUP (N=18). ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED PRE- AND POST-TESTING ASSESSMENTS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND AFTER THE YOGA PROGRAM, RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS: THE YOGA PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS (M AGE=51.18 (10.33); 92% FEMALE) INCLUDED PRIMARILY BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS, ON AVERAGE 55.95 (54.39) MONTHS POST-DIAGNOSIS. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE INTERVENTION AND THE CONTROL GROUP AT POST-INTERVENTION WERE SEEN ONLY IN PSYCHOSOCIAL (I.E. GLOBAL QUALITY OF LIFE, EMOTIONAL FUNCTION, AND DIARRHEA) VARIABLES (ALL P'S <0.05). THERE WERE ALSO TRENDS FOR GROUP DIFFERENCES, IN THE HYPOTHESIZED DIRECTIONS, FOR THE PSYCHOSOCIAL VARIABLES OF EMOTIONAL IRRITABILITY, GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS, COGNITIVE DISORGANIZATION, MOOD DISTURBANCE, TENSION, DEPRESSION, AND CONFUSION (ALL P'S <0.10). FINALLY, THERE WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN BOTH THE PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS AND THE CONTROLS FROM PRE- TO POST-INTERVENTION ON A NUMBER OF PHYSICAL FITNESS VARIABLES. CONCLUSIONS: THESE INITIAL FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA HAS SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL AND SHOULD BE FURTHER EXPLORED AS A BENEFICIAL PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OPTION FOR CANCER SURVIVORS. FUTURE RESEARCH MIGHT ATTEMPT TO INCLUDE A BROADER RANGE OF PARTICIPANTS (E.G. OTHER TYPES OF CANCER DIAGNOSES, MALE SUBJECTS), A LARGER SAMPLE SIZE, AND A LONGER PROGRAM DURATION IN AN RCT.	2006	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
9 2096  55 THE EFFECT OF YOGA EXERCISE ON IMPROVING DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND FATIGUE IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND FATIGUE ARE AMONG THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS THAT INFLUENCE THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER WHO RECEIVE ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY. ALTHOUGH EVIDENCE HAS SHOWN YOGA TO DECREASE ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER, FEW STUDIES ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA HAVE TARGETED PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. YOGA INTERVENTIONS SHOULD BE TESTED TO PROMOTE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH OF WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER. PURPOSE: THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AN 8-WEEK YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM IN PROMOTING THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH OF WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER UNDERGOING ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY IN TERMS OF DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND FATIGUE. METHODS: A SAMPLE OF 60 WOMEN WITH NONMETASTATIC BREAST CANCER WAS RECRUITED. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED INTO EITHER THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (N = 30) OR THE CONTROL GROUP (N = 30). A 60-MINUTE, TWICE-PER-WEEK YOGA EXERCISE WAS IMPLEMENTED FOR 8 WEEKS AS THE INTERVENTION FOR THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP. THE CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED STANDARD CARE ONLY. RESULTS: ANALYSIS USING THE JOHNSON-NEYMAN PROCEDURE FOUND THAT THE YOGA EXERCISE REDUCED OVERALL FATIGUE AND THE INTERFERENCE OF FATIGUE IN EVERYDAY LIFE FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PARTICIPANTS. SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS WERE OBTAINED AFTER 4 WEEKS OF INTERVENTION PARTICIPATION FOR THOSE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PATIENTS WITH RELATIVELY LOW STARTING BASELINE VALUES (BASELINE ITEM MEAN VALUE < 3.31 AND 3.22, RESPECTIVELY) AND AFTER 8 WEEKS FOR MOST PATIENTS (APPROXIMATELY 75%) WITH MODERATE STARTING BASELINE VALUES (BASELINE ITEM MEAN VALUE < 7.30 AND 5.34, RESPECTIVELY). THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE LEVELS OF DEPRESSION (F = 1.29, P > .05) OR ANXIETY (F = 2.7, P > .05). CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: THE 8-WEEK YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM DEVELOPED IN THIS STUDY EFFECTIVELY REDUCED FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER BUT DID NOT REDUCE DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY. ONCOLOGY NURSES SHOULD STRENGTHEN THEIR CLINICAL HEALTH EDUCATION AND APPLY YOGA TO REDUCE THE FATIGUE EXPERIENCED BY PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER WHO UNDERGO ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
10 2444  33 YOGA AND SOCIAL SUPPORT REDUCE PRENATAL DEPRESSION, ANXIETY AND CORTISOL. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA (PHYSICAL ACTIVITY) VERSUS SOCIAL SUPPORT (VERBAL ACTIVITY) ON PRENATAL AND POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION. NINETY-TWO PRENATALLY DEPRESSED WOMEN WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A YOGA OR A SOCIAL SUPPORT CONTROL GROUP AT 22 WEEKS GESTATION. THE YOGA GROUP PARTICIPATED IN A 20-MIN GROUP SESSION (ONLY PHYSICAL POSES) ONCE PER WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS. THE SOCIAL SUPPORT GROUP (A LEADERLESS DISCUSSION GROUP) MET ON THE SAME SCHEDULE. AT THE END OF THE FIRST AND LAST SESSIONS THE YOGA GROUP REPORTED LESS DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, ANGER, BACK AND LEG PAIN AS COMPARED TO THE SOCIAL SUPPORT GROUP. AT THE END OF THE LAST SESSION THE YOGA GROUP AND THE SUPPORT GROUP DID NOT DIFFER. THEY BOTH HAD LOWER DEPRESSION (CES-D), ANXIETY (STAI), AND ANGER (STAXI) SCORES AND IMPROVED RELATIONSHIP SCORES. IN ADDITION, CORTISOL LEVELS DECREASED FOR BOTH GROUPS FOLLOWING EACH SESSION. ESTRIOL AND PROGESTERONE LEVELS DECREASED AFTER THE LAST SESSION. AT THE POSTPARTUM FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENT DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY LEVELS WERE LOWER FOR BOTH GROUPS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
11 1085  34 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS, FATIGUE, MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN, AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG EMPLOYEES OF DIAMOND INDUSTRY: A NEW APPROACH IN EMPLOYEE WELLNESS. BACKGROUND: DIAMOND INDUSTRY EMPLOYEES OFTEN EXPERIENCE MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN, FATIGUE, AND STRESS, CONTRIBUTING TO A LOW QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). YOGA IS AN ANCIENT DISCIPLINE OF MIND-BODY PRACTICE YOGA HAS NUMEROUS HEALTH BENEFITS. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFICACY OF WORKPLACE YOGA IN IMPROVING STRESS, MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN, FATIGUE, AND QOL AMONG EMPLOYEES OF THE DIAMOND INDUSTRY. METHODS: ONE-HUNDRED SIXTY-SIX EMPLOYEES OF THE DIAMOND INDUSTRY BETWEEN THE AGES OF 20 AND 60 PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY. PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSIGNED TO EITHER YOGA (N = 84) OR WAITLIST (N = 82) GROUPS. THE YOGA GROUP RECEIVED ONE HOUR OF YOGA, FOUR DAYS A WEEK FOR THREE CONSECUTIVE MONTHS. PARTICIPANTS IN THE WAITLIST GROUP FOLLOWED THEIR DAILY ROUTINES. MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN, FATIGUE, STRESS, AND QOL WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND AFTER THREE MONTHS. RESULTS: ONE-HUNDRED FIFTY-FIVE EMPLOYEES COMPLETED THE STUDY. THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.05) IMPROVEMENT IN PAIN, PERCEIVED STRESS, FATIGUE, AND QOL DOMAINS AFTER THREE MONTHS COMPARED TO BASELINE. THE WAITLIST GROUP SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ANY OF THE MEASURES. IN THE POST SCORES COMPARISON BETWEEN THE GROUPS REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GROUPS. CONCLUSION: WORKPLACE YOGA FOUND TO BE A USEFUL, COST-EFFECTIVE AND FEASIBLE INTERVENTION IN IMPROVING STRESS, MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN, FATIGUES AND QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG EMPLOYEES OF THE DIAMOND INDUSTRY. YOGA MAY BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE WORKPLACE AS A WELLNESS PROGRAM AT THE WORKPLACE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
12 1267  34 FOLLOW-UP OF YOGA OF AWARENESS FOR FIBROMYALGIA: RESULTS AT 3 MONTHS AND REPLICATION IN THE WAIT-LIST GROUP. OBJECTIVES: PUBLISHED PRELIMINARY FINDINGS FROM A RANDOMIZED-CONTROLLED TRIAL SUGGEST THAT AN 8-WEEK YOGA OF AWARENESS INTERVENTION MAY BE EFFECTIVE FOR IMPROVING SYMPTOMS, FUNCTIONAL DEFICITS, AND COPING ABILITIES IN FIBROMYALGIA. THE PRIMARY AIMS OF THIS STUDY WERE TO EVALUATE THE SAME INTERVENTION'S POSTTREATMENT EFFECTS IN A WAIT-LIST GROUP AND TO TEST THE INTERVENTION'S EFFECTS AT 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP IN THE IMMEDIATE TREATMENT GROUP. METHODS: UNPAIRED T TESTS WERE USED TO COMPARE DATA FROM A PER PROTOCOL SAMPLE OF 21 WOMEN IN THE IMMEDIATE TREATMENT GROUP WHO HAD COMPLETED TREATMENT AND 18 WOMEN IN THE WAIT-LIST GROUP WHO HAD COMPLETED TREATMENT. WITHIN-GROUP PAIRED T TESTS WERE PERFORMED TO COMPARE POSTTREATMENT DATA WITH 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP DATA IN THE IMMEDIATE TREATMENT GROUP. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS THE FIBROMYALGIA IMPACT QUESTIONNAIRE REVISED (FIQR). MULTILEVEL RANDOM-EFFECTS MODELS WERE ALSO USED TO EXAMINE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN YOGA PRACTICE RATES AND OUTCOMES. RESULTS: POSTTREATMENT RESULTS IN THE WAIT-LIST GROUP LARGELY MIRRORED RESULTS SEEN AT POSTTREATMENT IN THE IMMEDIATE TREATMENT GROUP, WITH THE FIQR TOTAL SCORE IMPROVING BY 31.9% ACROSS THE 2 GROUPS. FOLLOW-UP RESULTS SHOWED THAT PATIENTS SUSTAINED MOST OF THEIR POSTTREATMENT GAINS, WITH THE FIQR TOTAL SCORE REMAINING 21.9% IMPROVED AT 3 MONTHS. YOGA PRACTICE RATES WERE GOOD, AND MORE PRACTICE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH MORE BENEFIT FOR A VARIETY OF OUTCOMES. DISCUSSION: THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE BENEFITS OF YOGA OF AWARENESS IN FIBROMYALGIA ARE REPLICABLE AND CAN BE MAINTAINED.	2012

14 1585  42 MEDICAL YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH STRESS-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSES IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PATIENTS ARE SUFFERING FROM STRESS-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE MEDICAL YOGA TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH STRESS-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSES IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE. A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY WAS PERFORMED AT A PRIMARY HEALTH CARE CENTRE IN SWEDEN FROM MARCH TO JUNE, 2011. PATIENTS WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO A CONTROL GROUP RECEIVING STANDARD CARE OR A YOGA GROUP TREATED WITH MEDICAL YOGA FOR 1 HOUR, ONCE A WEEK, OVER A 12-WEEK PERIOD IN ADDITION TO THE STANDARD CARE. A TOTAL OF 37 MEN AND WOMEN, MEAN AGE OF 53 +/- 12 YEARS WERE INCLUDED. GENERAL STRESS LEVEL (MEASURED USING PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE (PSS)), BURNOUT (SHIROM-MELAMED BURNOUT QUESTIONNAIRE (SMBQ)), ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION (HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE (HADS)), INSOMNIA SEVERITY (INSOMNIA SEVERITY INDEX (ISI)), PAIN (VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS)), AND OVERALL HEALTH STATUS (EURO QUALITY OF LIFE VAS (EQ-VAS)) WERE MEASURED BEFORE AND AFTER 12 WEEKS. PATIENTS ASSIGNED TO THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENTS ON MEASURES OF GENERAL STRESS LEVEL (P < 0.000), ANXIETY (P < 0.019), AND OVERALL HEALTH STATUS (P < 0.018) COMPARED TO CONTROLS. TREATMENT WITH MEDICAL YOGA IS EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING LEVELS OF STRESS AND ANXIETY IN PATIENTS WITH STRESS-RELATED SYMPTOMS IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
15  748  29 EFFECT OF SAHAJA YOGA MEDITATION ON QUALITY OF LIFE, ANXIETY, AND BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL. OBJECTIVE: THE PRESENT STUDY INVESTIGATES THE EFFECT OF SAHAJA YOGA MEDITATION ON QUALITY OF LIFE, ANXIETY, AND BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL. DESIGN: THE PROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL COHORT STUDY ENROLLED TWO STUDY GROUPS: THOSE RECEIVING TREATMENT FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SAHAJA YOGA RESEARCH AND HEALTH CENTER (MEDITATION GROUP) AND THOSE RECEIVING TREATMENT FROM THE MAHATMA GANDHI MISSION HOSPITAL (CONTROL GROUP). RESEARCHERS MEASURED QUALITY OF LIFE, ANXIETY, AND BLOOD PRESSURE BEFORE AND AFTER TREATMENT. RESULTS: SIXTY-SEVEN (67) PARTICIPANTS IN THE MEDITATION GROUP AND 62 PARTICIPANTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP COMPLETED THE STUDY. THE TWO GROUPS WERE COMPARABLE IN DEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS. AT BASELINE, THE MEDITATION GROUP HAD HIGHER QUALITY OF LIFE (P<0.001) THAN CONTROLS BUT SIMILAR ANXIETY LEVEL (P=0.74) TO CONTROLS. WITHIN-GROUP PRE- VERSUS POST-TREATMENT COMPARISONS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN QUALITY OF LIFE, ANXIETY, AND BLOOD PRESSURE IN THE MEDITATION GROUP (P<0.001), WHILE IN CONTROLS, QUALITY OF LIFE DETERIORATED AND THERE WAS NO IMPROVEMENT IN BLOOD PRESSURE. THE IMPROVEMENT IN QUALITY OF LIFE, ANXIETY REDUCTION, AND BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL WAS GREATER IN THE MEDITATION GROUP. THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF MEDITATION REMAINED SIGNIFICANT AFTER ADJUSTING FOR CONFOUNDERS. CONCLUSIONS: MEDITATION TREATMENT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN QUALITY OF LIFE, ANXIETY REDUCTION, AND BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
16 2653  44 YOGA IMPROVES OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE, DEPRESSION, AND DAILY ACTIVITIES FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC PAIN IS A COMPLEX ACCUMULATION OF PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS, THUS INTERVENTIONS THAT ADDRESS PAIN AND PROMOTE OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE ARE NEEDED. A HOLISTIC INTERVENTION, WITH MIND AND BODY COMPONENTS, IS LIKELY NECESSARY TO BEST TREAT THE COMPLEXITIES OF CHRONIC PAIN. THUS, WE DEVELOPED AND TESTED A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN. OBJECTIVES: IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL (RCT), PARTICIPANTS WITH CHRONIC PAIN WERE RANDOMIZED TO A YOGA INTERVENTION OR USUAL CARE GROUP. BETWEEN AND WITHIN GROUP DIFFERENCES FOR PRE-AND POST-OUTCOME MEASURE SCORES WERE ASSESSED FOR: OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE, COMPLETION OF ACTIVITIES, AND DEPRESSION. METHODS: PILOT RCT WITH PARTICIPANT ALLOCATION TO 8 WEEKS OF YOGA OR USUAL CARE. BOTH GROUPS RECEIVED ONGOING MONTHLY SELF-MANAGEMENT PROGRAMMING. DATA WERE COLLECTED BEFORE AND AFTER THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA OR USUAL CARE AFTER BASELINE ASSESSMENTS. DEMOGRAPHICS WERE COLLECTED AND MEASURES INCLUDED: CANADIAN OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE MEASURE (COPM) TO ASSESS OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE; THE 15-ITEM FRENCHAY ACTIVITIES INDEX (FAI)(ACTIVITIES); AND THE 9-ITEM PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE (PHQ-9) FOR DEPRESSION. INDEPENDENT T-TESTS WERE USED TO ASSESS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS. PAIRED T-TESTS WERE USED TO ASSESS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRE- AND POST 8-WEEK INTERVENTION FOR BOTH THE YOGA AND THE USUAL CARE GROUPS. PERCENT CHANGE SCORES AND EFFECT SIZES WERE CALCULATED. RESULTS: 83 PEOPLE WERE RECRUITED FOR THE STUDY AND COMPLETED BASELINE ASSESSMENTS; 44 INDIVIDUALS WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA AND 39 TO THE CONTROL GROUP. THE AVERAGE AGE OF ALL PARTICIPANTS WAS 51.4+/-10.5 YEARS, 68% WERE FEMALE; AND 60% HAD AT LEAST SOME COLLEGE EDUCATION. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN DEMOGRAPHICS OR OUTCOME MEASURES BETWEEN GROUPS AT BASELINE OR 8 WEEKS; HOWEVER, THE STUDY WAS NOT POWERED TO SEE SUCH DIFFERENCES. INDIVIDUALS RANDOMIZED TO THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE IN ANY OUTCOME MEASURE OVER THE 8 WEEKS. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN COPM PERFORMANCE AND COPM SATISFACTION SCORES FOR INDIVIDUALS RANDOMIZED TO THE YOGA GROUP; BOTH SCORES SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED. COPM PERFORMANCE IMPROVED BY 27% WITH A MODERATE TO LARGE EFFECT SIZE (3.66+/-1.85 VS 4.66+/-1.93, P < 0.001, D = 0.76). COPM SATISFACTION SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED BY 78% (2.14+/-2.31 VS. 3.80+/-2.50, P < 0.001) AND HAD A LARGE EFFECTS SIZE (D = 1.02). FAI SCORES IMPROVED, INDICATING INCREASED ACTIVITY OR ENGAGEMENT IN DAILY OCCUPATION DURING THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION. SCORES INCREASED BY 5% (38.13+/-8.48 VS. 39.90+/-8.57, P = 0.024) WITH A SMALL EFFECT SIZE (D = 0.37). DEPRESSION SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED FROM 13.21+/-5.60 TO 11.41+/-5.82, P = 0.041, WITH A SMALL EFFECT SIZE. CONCLUSION: DATA FROM THIS PILOT RCT INDICATE YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION WITH PEOPLE IN CHRONIC PAIN TO IMPROVE OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE, INCREASE ENGAGEMENT IN ACTIVITIES, AND DECREASE DEPRESSION. OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY PRACTITIONERS MAY CONSIDER ADDING YOGA AS A TREATMENT INTERVENTION TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH PAIN.	2019	

17 2464  40 YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION IN THE MANAGEMENT OF DYSFUNCTIONAL UTERINE BLEEDING: A CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: DYSFUNCTIONAL UTERINE BLEEDING (DUB) IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON GYNECOLOGICAL DISORDERS ENCOUNTERED IN WOMEN DURING THE REPRODUCTIVE AGE. YOGA THERAPY HAS SHOWN PROMISING BENEFITS IN SEVERAL GYNECOLOGICAL DISORDERS. METHODS: THIRTY WOMEN BETWEEN THE AGES OF 20 AND 40 YEARS WITH PRIMARY DUB WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A YOGA (N = 15) AND A WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 15). PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP RECEIVED A 3-MONTH YOGA MODULE AND WERE ASSESSED FOR HEMOGLOBIN VALUES, ENDOMETRIAL THICKNESS (ET), PICTORIAL BLOOD LOSS ASSESSMENT CHART (PBAC), STATE-TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY, PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE, AND PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI) BEFORE AND AFTER A 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. RESULTS: AT THE END OF 3 MONTHS OF INTERVENTION, THE YOGA GROUP, UNLIKE THE CONTROL GROUP, REPORTED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE ANXIETY SCORES (P < 0.05) AND PERCEIVED STRESS (P < 0.05). THE PSQI SCORES INDICATED A REDUCTION IN SLEEP DISTURBANCES (P < 0.001) AND THE NEED FOR SLEEP MEDICATIONS (P < 0.01) AND HIGHER GLOBAL SCORES (P < 0.001). HOWEVER, THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN PBAC AND ET IN BOTH THE GROUPS. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT YOGA THERAPY POSITIVELY IMPACTS THE OUTCOME OF DUB BY REDUCING THE PERCEIVED STRESS AND STATE ANXIETY AND IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF SLEEP. THIS WARRANTS LARGER CLINICAL TRIALS TO VALIDATE THE FINDINGS OF THIS PILOT STUDY.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
18  290  34 ADJUNCTIVE YOGA V. HEALTH EDUCATION FOR PERSISTENT MAJOR DEPRESSION: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER HATHA YOGA IS AN EFFICACIOUS ADJUNCTIVE INTERVENTION FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH CONTINUED DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS DESPITE ANTIDEPRESSANT TREATMENT. METHOD: WE CONDUCTED A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES (N = 63) V. HEALTH EDUCATION CLASSES (HEALTHY LIVING WORKSHOP; HLW; N = 59) IN INDIVIDUALS WITH ELEVATED DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATION USE. HLW SERVED AS AN ATTENTION-CONTROL GROUP. THE INTERVENTION PERIOD WAS 10 WEEKS, WITH FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENTS 3 AND 6 MONTHS AFTERWARDS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS DEPRESSION SYMPTOM SEVERITY ASSESSED BY BLIND RATER AT 10 WEEKS. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS OVER THE ENTIRE INTERVENTION AND FOLLOW-UP PERIODS, SOCIAL AND ROLE FUNCTIONING, GENERAL HEALTH PERCEPTIONS, PAIN, AND PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING. RESULTS: AT 10 WEEKS, WE DID NOT FIND A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS IN DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS (B = -0.82, S.E. = 0.88, P = 0.36). HOWEVER, OVER THE ENTIRE INTERVENTION AND FOLLOW-UP PERIOD, WHEN CONTROLLING FOR BASELINE, YOGA PARTICIPANTS SHOWED LOWER LEVELS OF DEPRESSION THAN HLW PARTICIPANTS (B = -1.38, S.E. = 0.57, P = 0.02). AT 6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP, 51% OF YOGA PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED A RESPONSE (50% REDUCTION IN DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS) COMPARED WITH 31% OF HLW PARTICIPANTS (ODDS RATIO = 2.31; P = 0.04). YOGA PARTICIPANTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER SOCIAL AND ROLE FUNCTIONING AND GENERAL HEALTH PERCEPTIONS OVER TIME. CONCLUSIONS: ALTHOUGH WE DID NOT SEE A DIFFERENCE IN DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AT THE END OF THE INTERVENTION PERIOD, YOGA PARTICIPANTS SHOWED FEWER DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS OVER THE ENTIRE FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. BENEFITS OF YOGA MAY ACCUMULATE OVER TIME.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
19 1818  40 PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF STANDARD ANTIEMETIC THERAPY WITH YOGA VERSUS STANDARD ANTIEMETIC THERAPY ALONE FOR HIGHLY EMETOGENIC CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA AND VOMITING IN SOUTH ASIAN POPULATION. AIM/BACKGROUND: CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA AND VOMITING (CINV) IS ONE OF THE MOST DISTRESSING SIDE EFFECTS OF HIGHLY EMETOGENIC CHEMOTHERAPY REGIMENS. THERE HAVE BEEN CONTINUOUS EFFORTS IN THE DIRECTION TO CONTROL CINV BY MANY INVESTIGATORS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RANDOMLY SELECTED PATIENTS WERE THOSE RECEIVING HIGHLY EMETOGENIC CHEMOTHERAPY REGIMEN GROUPED INTO YOGA AND STANDARD ANTIEMETIC THERAPY (N = 50) JUST BEFORE RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY AND CONTINUED FOR THE FOLLOWING DAYS AND OTHER GROUP (N = 50) RECEIVED ONLY THE STANDARD ANTIEMETIC AGENT. BOTH THE GROUPS WERE ASSESSED, FOLLOWED FOR ACUTE AND DELAYED ONSET OF CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED AND ANTICIPATORY NAUSEA AND VOMITING USING RADIATION THERAPY ONCOLOGY GROUP GRADING FOR THE SAME. WE ALSO ASSESSED THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF THE PATIENT USING THE FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CANCER THERAPY-GENERAL QUESTIONNAIRE. RESULTS: THE MEDIAN AGE GROUP OF THE PATIENTS WAS 51 YEARS WITH MALE:FEMALE RATIO 2:1, THE EASTERN COOPERATIVE ONCOLOGY GROUP (ECOG) PERFORMANCE STATUS WAS 0/1 IN 38% OF THE SELECTED POPULATION, WHILE ECOG 2 IN 62% OF THE PATIENTS. IN YOGA ARM, INSIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA (90% VS. 78%, P = 0.35) AND BUT SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN VOMITING (42% VS. 22%, P =0.01) WAS OBSERVED AS COMPARED TO THE STANDARD ANTIEMETICS ONLY ARM. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN GRADE 2 AND 3 NAUSEA (84% VS. 38% P < 0.01) AND VOMITING (14% VS. 0% P < 0.01). QUALITY OF LIFE IS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED IN THE YOGA ARM, ESPECIALLY IN THE ECOG 2 PERFORMANCE STATUS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY CONCLUDES THAT YOGA ALONG WITH STANDARD ANTIEMETIC MEDICATION SHOULD BE A PART OF THE MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR THE CANCER PATIENTS RECEIVING HIGHLY EMETOGENIC CHEMOTHERAPY.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
20 1833  33 PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLNESS, YOGA AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS AFFECTED BY SCHIZOPHRENIA SPECTRUM DISORDERS: A PILOT STUDY. SCHIZOPHRENIA IS A SERIOUS PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER CHARACTERIZED BY POSITIVE SYMPTOMS, NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS AND NEUROCOGNITIVE DEFICITS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ESTIMATE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN WELLNESS, YOGA AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS AFFECTED BY SCHIZOPHRENIA SPECTRUM DISORDERS. PARTICIPANTS WERE 30 PATIENTS WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA IN CARE AT THE REHABILITATIVE PSYCHIATRY AND RESEARCH VILLA CHIARA CLINIC IN MASCALUCIA (CATANIA, ITALY), AFTER THAT RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO TWO GROUPS. THE FIRST GROUP FOLLOWED THE EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT WITH SETS OF YOGA EXERCISES CONDUCTED BY A YOGA TRAINER AND A PSYCHIATRIST OR A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST EXPERT IN YOGA, WHILE A SECOND CONTROL GROUP WAS TREATED WITH USUAL CARE. THE RESULTS REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE, BEFORE AND AFTER TREATMENT, BETWEEN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND THE CONTROL GROUP IN QUALITY OF LIFE.	2019

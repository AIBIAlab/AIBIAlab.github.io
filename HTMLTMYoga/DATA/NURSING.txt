1  158 95 A RADICAL RN- BS NURSING CLASS: OUTCOMES FROM AN INTEGRATIVE YOGA ELECTIVE. WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHONEUROIMMUNOLOGICAL RESPONSES AND THE KNOWN HIGH STRESS LEVELS OF NURSING STUDENTS, AS CARING NURSE EDUCATORS, WE HAVE BECOME ETHICALLY OBLIGATED TO REVISE AND RE-VISION OUR CURRENT NURSING EDUCATIONAL PRACTICES. NURSE EDUCATORS SHOULD BE MOTIVATED TO CREATE INNOVATIVE AND RADICAL CARING SCIENCE CURRICULAR APPROACHES, SO THAT OUR NURSES OF THE FUTURE ARE IN TURN SUPPORTED IN CREATING CARING- HEALING SUSTAINABLE BEDSIDE PRACTICES. THIS PAPER DETAILS THE OUTCOMES FROM AN UPPER LEVEL YOGA ELECTIVE IN AN RN- BSN PROGRAM. THE COURSE IS JUST ONE WITHIN AN INNOVATIVE HOLISTIC-INTEGRAL NURSING CURRICULUM THAT SUPPORTS NURSES IN PRACTICING SELF-CARE AS A WAY TO SUPPORT THEIR ABILITY TO CREATE CARING-HEALING MOMENTS AND SPACES FOR PATIENTS, IMPLEMENT CHANGE IN THE WORKPLACE, AND AVOID THE PERILS OF BURN-OUT RELATED TO LOW STRESS RESILIENCE, WHICH IS SO COMMON WITHIN THE NURSING PROFESSION.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
2 2092 17 THE EFFECT OF THE YOGA COURSE ON MINDFULNESS AND SELF-COMPASSION AMONG NURSING STUDENTS. PURPOSE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON MINDFULNESS AND SELF-COMPASSION AMONG NURSING STUDENTS. DESIGN AND METHODS: THE QUASIEXPERIMENTAL SINGLE-GROUP PRETEST-POSTTEST DESIGN STUDY CONDUCTED WITH 47 NURSING STUDENTS. THE DATA WERE COLLECTED USING A "PERSONAL DATA FORM," THE "MINDFUL ATTENTION AWARENESS SCALE (MAAS)," AND THE "SELF-COMPASSION SCALE (SCS)." FINDINGS: WHILE THE MEAN SCORE OF THE STUDENTS FROM THE "MAAS" WAS 60.51 (+/-11.35) IN THE PRETEST, IT INCREASED TO 63.7 (+/-8.75) IN THE POSTTEST (P < 0.05). WHILE THE MEAN SCORE OF THE STUDENTS FROM THE SCS WAS 3.22 +/- 0.69 IN THE PRETEST, IT INCREASED TO 3.59 (+/-0.53) IN THE POSTTEST (P < 0.05). A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP WAS FOUND BETWEEN MINDFULNESS AND SCS SCORES (R = 0.162). PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: AFTER THE YOGA COURSE, MINDFULNESS AND SELF-COMPASSION OF THE STUDENTS WERE FOUND TO BE HIGHER THAN IT WAS BEFORE THE LESSONS. THE HIGHER THE MINDFULNESS LEVEL OF THE STUDENTS IS, THE HIGHER THE LEVEL OF SELF-COMPASSION IS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
3  843 26 EFFECT OF YOGA ON PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONING OF NURSING STUDENTS: A RANDOMIZED WAIT LIST CONTROL TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: NURSING STUDENTS EXPERIENCE CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF STRESS TO MEET THEIR PROFESSIONAL DEMANDS. YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE PRACTICE TO REDUCE STRESS AND IMPROVE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL BEING. HOWEVER, IMPROVEMENT IN PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL BEING AIDS IN STRESS MANAGEMENT. AIM: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EIGHT WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION ON PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONING OF NURSING STUDENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS WAS A RANDOMISED WAIT LIST CONTROL (WLC) TRIAL, WE RECRUITED TOTAL 100 STUDENTS FROM KEMPEGOWDA INSTITUTE OF NURSING, BENGALURU, KARNATAKA, INDIA AND RANDOMIZED THEM INTO TWO GROUPS (YOGA=50 AND WLC=50 STUDENTS). THE FOLLOWING INSTRUMENTS WERE USED TO COLLECT THE DATA, FREIBURG MINDFULNESS INVENTORY (FMI), SELF-COMPASSION SCALE- SHORT FORM (SCS-SF), CONNOR-DAVIDSON RESILIENCE SCALE (CD-RISC), SATISFACTION WITH LIFE SCALE (SWLS), JEFFERSON SCALE OF EMPATHY HPS-VERSION (JSE-HPS), AND PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE (PSS). DATA WAS ANALYSED USING REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (RM-ANOVA) FOLLOWED BY POST-HOC BONFERRONI CORRECTION FOR ALL PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIABLES. RESULTS: THE RESULTS OF OUR STUDY REPORT THAT EIGHT WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING SELF COMPASSION AND MINDFULNESS AMONG NURSING STUDENTS IN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP THAN COMPARED TO WLC GROUP. EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE IMPROVEMENTS IN RESILIENCE, SATISFACTION IN LIFE AND PERCEIVED STRESS, RESULTS WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. CONCLUSION: OVERALL, RESULTS OF THE PRESENT STUDY HAVE DEMONSTRATED IMPACT OF EIGHT WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONING OF NURSING STUDENTS. YOGA INTERVENTION CAN BE INCULCATED IN THE NURSING EDUCATION TO MEET DEMANDS OF THE PROFESSION.	2017	
                                                                                            
4 1330 18 HOLISTIC NURSING IN PRACTICE: MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION TO MANAGE STRESS AND BURNOUT. PURPOSE: EFFECTS OF A MINDFULNESS-BASED (MB) YOGA PRACTICE ON STRESS, BURNOUT, AND INDICATORS OF WELL-BEING AMONG NURSES AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (HCPS). DESIGN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, 80 HCPS ASSIGNED TO EITHER MB YOGA INTERVENTION OR CONTROL GROUP. METHOD: THE MB YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 41) ATTENDED WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES AND PRACTICED YOGA INDEPENDENTLY. THE CONTROL GROUP (N = 39) DID NOT RECEIVE THE YOGA INTERVENTION. STUDY PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED PRE- AND POSTINTERVENTION QUESTIONNAIRES, INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED (A) PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE; (B) MASLACH BURNOUT INVENTORY; (C) VITALITY SUBSCALE OF THE MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY SHORT FORM-36; (D) GLOBAL SLEEP QUALITY ITEM, (E) MINDFULNESS AWARENESS SURVEY, AND (F) SUBSCALE OF THE BRIEF SERENITY SCALE. DIURNAL SALIVARY CORTISOL AND BLOOD PRESSURE WERE ASSESSED PRE AND POSTINTERVENTION. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS (P < .01) NOTED IN MB YOGA COMPARED WITH CONTROL FOR SELF-REPORTED FACTORS, INCLUDING STRESS (PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE), BURNOUT (MASLACH BURNOUT INVENTORY), VITALITY (MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY SHORT FORM-36), SLEEP (GSQ), SERENITY/INNER HAVEN (IH), AND MINDFULNESS (MINDFULNESS AWARENESS SURVEY). DIURNAL CORTISOL SLOPES AND BLOOD PRESSURE WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED. CONCLUSION: THE MB YOGA INTERVENTION HAD A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF NURSES AND HCPS, MOST SPECIFICALLY FOR MEASURES OF STRESS; PERCEIVED STRESS, BURNOUT, VITALITY, SLEEP QUALITY, SERENITY, AND MINDFULNESS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
5 2115 12 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH HAEMOPHILIA. THE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY HAEMOPHILIA LEAD TO IMPAIRMENTS OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH HAEMOPHILIA. THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH HAEMOPHILIA IN SHIRAZ, IRAN. THIS SEMI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WITH PRE- AND POST-TEST DESIGN WAS PERFORMED ON 27 BOYS BETWEEN 8 AND 16 YEARS OLD WHO SUFFERED FROM HAEMOPHILIA. THE PATIENTS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS. THE NUMBER OF BLEEDINGS, ABSENCES FROM SCHOOL, AND REFERRALS TO THE CLINIC WAS EVALUATED. THE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH INTERVIEWS AND USING THE PATIENTS' RECORDS IN THE HAEMOPHILIA CENTER. BESIDES, THE QUALITY OF LIFE WAS ASSESSED THROUGH THE HAEMO-QOL QUESTIONNAIRE. THEN, THE YOGA INTERVENTION WAS PERFORMED FOR 14 WEEKS AND THE DATA WERE COLLECTED IN THREE STAGES. THE COLLECTED DATA WERE ENTERED INTO THE SPSS STATISTICAL SOFTWARE, VERSION 18 AND WERE ANALYZED USING NON-PARAMETRIC FRIEDMAN TEST. AFTER THE INTERVENTION, SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED IN THE MEAN SCORES OF QUALITY OF LIFE DIMENSIONS AND THE NUMBER OF BLEEDINGS, SCHOOL ABSENCES, AND REFERRALS TO THE HAEMOPHILIA CLINIC (P<0.001). THUS, YOGA MAY IMPROVE THE HAEMOPHILIA CHILDREN'S AND ADOLESCENTS' PERCEPTION OF QUALITY OF LIFE WITHOUT THE RISK OF INJURY. THIS INTERVENTION ALSO SEEMED TO BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE NUMBER OF BLEEDINGS, REFERRALS TO THE HAEMOPHILIA CLINIC, AND ABSENCES FROM SCHOOL.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
6 1432 18 IMPROVING PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH IN FRONTLINE MENTAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS: YOGA-BASED STRESS MANAGEMENT VERSUS COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL STRESS MANAGEMENT. THE NEED FOR BRIEF, LOW-COST, EASILY DISSEMINABLE AND EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS TO PROMOTE HEALTHY LIFESTYLES IS HIGH. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. WE DEVELOPED TWO STUDIES TO COMPARE THE IMPACTS OF COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL STRESS MANAGEMENT (CBSM) AND YOGA BASED STRESS MANAGEMENT (YBSM) INTERVENTIONS FOR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS. STUDY 1 OFFERED AN 8-WEEK YBSM INTERVENTION TO 37 MENTAL HEALTHCARE PARTICIPANTS AND COLLECTED HEALTH DATA PRE AND POST. STUDY 2 OFFERED YBSM AND CBSM CLASSES TO 40 RANDOMLY ASSIGNED MENTAL HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND COLLECTED MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH DATA AT FOUR TIME POINTS. IN STUDY 1, USING T-TESTS, THE YBSM INTERVENTION AFFECTED A NUMBER OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL WELLBEING INDICES PRE TO POST. IN STUDY 2, USING LINEAR MIXED MODELING, BOTH YBSM AND CBSM GROUPS IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY (P <.05) IN FRUIT AND VEGETABLE INTAKE, HEART RATE, ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION, RELAXATION AND AWARENESS, PROFESSIONAL QUALITY OF LIFE, COMPASSION SATISFACTION, BURNOUT, DEPRESSION, AND STRESS LEVELS. THERE WAS A GROUP BY TIME EFFECT FOR COPING CONFIDENCE (CBSM INCREASED MORE, P<.05, F = 4.34), PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (YBSM INCREASED MORE, P<.05, F = 3.47), OVERALL MENTAL HEALTH (YBSM INCREASED MORE, P<.10, F =5.32), AND SECONDARY TRAUMATIC STRESS (YBSM DECREASED MORE, P<.10, F = 4.89). YBSM AND CBSM APPEAR TO BE USEFUL FOR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS' MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH. YBSM DEMONSTRATES SOME BENEFIT ABOVE AND BEYOND THE EXTREMELY WELL-STUDIED AND EMPIRICALLY SUPPORTED CBSM, INCLUDING INCREASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, OVERALL MENTAL HEALTH, AND DECREASED SECONDARY TRAUMATIC STRESS BENEFITS.	2017	
                                                                                                         
7 1475 15 INTEGRATED APPROACH TO YOGA. YOGA IS A SCIENCE OF HOLISTIC LIVING AND NOT MERELY A SET OF ASANAS AND PRANAYAMA. IT IS A PSYCHO PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL SCIENCE, WHICH AIMS AT THE HARMONIOUS DEVELOPMENT OF THE HUMAN BODY, MIND AND SOUL. YOGA IS THE CONSCIOUS ART OF SELF-DISCOVERY. IT IS A PROCESS BY WHICH ANIMAL MAN ASCENDS THROUGH THE STAGES FROM NORMAL MAN TO SUPER MAN AND THEN THE DIVINE MAN. IT IS AN EXPANSION OF THE NARROW CONSTRICTED EGOISTIC PERSONALITY TO AN ALL-PERVASIVE ETERNAL AND BLISSFUL STATE OF REALITY. YOGA IS AN ALL ROUND DEVELOPMENT OF PERSONALITY AT PHYSICAL, MENTAL INTELLECTUAL, EMOTIONAL AND SPIRITUAL LEVEL.	2000	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
8 2757 18 YOGA PRACTICES AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING OF STUDENT NURSES. YOGA HAS BEEN WITH US SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL, BUT IT IS ONLY DURING RECENT YEARS THAT IT HAS ASSUMED WORLDWIDE IMPORTANCE. THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE CT OF SELECTED YOGA PRACTICES ON PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING. IN THIS QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL ONE GROUP PRE-TEST AND POST- TEST STUDY, 83 UNDER GRADUATE STUDENT NURSES. WERE TAUGHT SELECTED YOGA EXERCISES. THE SE- LECTED YOGA EXERCISES WERE SYSTEMATIC RELAXATION, BREATHING, AND STRETCHING THAT WERE PER- FORMED IN THE FORMATIVE MANNER. THE' INTERVENTION WAS CARRIED OUT FOR THE MINIMAL DURATION OF ONE HOUR PER DAY, THREE DAYS A WEEK FOR A PERIOD OF 6 WEEKS. ASSESSMENT WAS- CARRIED OUT ON THE FIRST AND LAST- DAY OF THE INTERVENTION, USING-A MODIFIED HINDI VERSION OF POSITIVE AFFECT AND NEGATIVE AFFECT SCALE, (PANAS-H). IT,HAS 10 QUESTIONS EACH TO MEASURE POSITIVE (PA) AND NEGA- TIVE AFFECT (NA). SINCE THE DATA WAS TESTED AND FORMED A NORMAL DISTRIBUTION, THE PAIRED 'T' TEST WAS USED FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. THE. MEAN PA SCORE OF 42.92 AFTER YOGA PRACTICE WAS STATISTI- CALLY HIGHER THAN THE MEAN PA SCORE OF 32. 50 BEFORE YOGA PRACTICE (P=O. 01). THE MEAN NA SCORE OF 20.75 AFTER YOGA PRACTICE WAS LOWER THAN THE MEAN NA SCORE OF 23.33 BEFORE YOGA PRACTICE (P=0.427). THE YOGA PRACTICE CAN BE TAUGHT TO NORMALPARTICIPANTS AS IT MAY REDUCE NEGATIVE AFFECT AND INCREASE THE POSITIVE AFFECT WITHIN A FEW WEEKS.	2015

10 2918 18 [THE EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA EXERCISES ON STRESS AND ANXIETY LEVELS IN MASTECTOMIZED WOMEN]. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA ON STRESS AND ANXIETY LEVELS IN MASTECTOMIZED WOMEN. IT ALSO INVESTIGATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE LEVELS WITH THE FOLLOWING VARIABLES: AGE; MARITAL STATUS; RELIGION; INSTRUCTION; PROFESSION; SMOKE ADDICTION; ELITISM; STAGING OF THE DISEASE; AND TREATMENT PHASE. THIS INVOLVED CONTROLLED RANDOM CLINICAL TRIAL SAMPLING OF 45 MASTECTOMIZED WOMEN TREATED AT THE ILZA BIANCO OUTPATIENT SERVICE OF SANTA RITA DE CASSIA HOSPITAL IN THE BRAZILIAN STATE OF ESPIRITO SANTO FROM MARCH TO NOVEMBER 2010. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PARTICIPATED IN 6 INDIVIDUALLY-APPLIED SESSIONS WITH INCENTIVE FOR ONGOING HOME PRACTICE AND WAS RE-EVALUATED AFTER THE PERIOD, WHEREAS THE CONTROL GROUP WAS RE-EVALUATED AFTER A PROPORTIONAL PERIOD. FOR THE STUDY OF THE VARIABLES, THE INTERVIEW AND RECORDING ON A FORM TECHNIQUE WAS USED, ALONG WITH THE ANXIETY TRAIT AND STATE TEST, AND THE STRESS SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS TEST. FOR STATISTICAL TREATMENT, THE STATISTICAL PACK FOR SOCIAL SCIENCES WAS USED. THE DATA ARE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AND HAVE SHOWN THAT HATHA YOGA EXERCISES DECREASE STRESS AND ANXIETY IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP. NO CONNECTION BETWEEN CONFOUNDING VARIABLES AND ANXIETY AND STRESS LEVELS WAS FOUND.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
11 1312 15 HEALTH STATUS OF NURSES AND YOGA. I. BASELINE DATA. IN THIS ONGOING ICMR PROJECT ON "EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE HEALTH OF NURSES", SOME BASELINE DATA ON THE HEALTH OF NURSES OF NEHRU HOSPITAL, P.G.I., CHANDIGARH ARE REPORTED. THIS WAS OBTAINED BEFORE THE START OF YOGA THERAPY IN SELECTED CASES AND COLLECTED WITH THE HELP OF SIX PSYCHOLOGICAL TOOLS. OUT OF A TOTAL OF 501 NURSES, 452 (90.2%) COULD BE CONTACTED AND STUDIED. MEAN AGE WAS 30.43 YEARS AND MEAN YEARS OF SERVICE 9.93 YEARS. MEAN SCORES ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS INDICATED POOR HEALTH STATUS OF NURSES, AVERAGE NEUROTICISM, DEPRESSIVE TENDENCIES AND ROLE STRESS. SENSE OF WELL-BEING WAS HIGH IN THEM. THE DATA IS DISCUSSED IN THE LIGHT OF RESEARCHES IN THIS AREA. THIS IS THE FIRST OF A SERIES OF THREE ARTICLES TO BE PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL.	1989	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
12 2125 19 THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TAI CHI, YOGA, MEDITATION, AND REIKI HEALING SESSIONS IN PROMOTING HEALTH AND ENHANCING PROBLEM SOLVING ABILITIES OF REGISTERED NURSES. GIVEN THE CURRENT NECESSITY OF RETAINING QUALIFIED NURSES, A SELF-CARE PROGRAM CONSISTING OF YOGA, TAI CHI, MEDITATION CLASSES, AND REIKI HEALING SESSIONS WAS DESIGNED FOR A UNIVERSITY-BASED HOSPITAL. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE INTERVENTIONS WAS EVALUATED USING SELF-CARE JOURNALS AND ANALYZED USING A HEIDEGGERIAN PHENOMENOLOGICAL APPROACH. OUTCOMES OF THE SELF-CARE CLASSES DESCRIBED BY NURSES INCLUDED: (A) NOTICING SENSATIONS OF WARMTH, TINGLING, AND PULSATION WHICH WERE RELAXING, (B) BECOMING AWARE OF AN ENHANCED PROBLEM SOLVING ABILITY, AND (C) NOTICING AN INCREASED ABILITY TO FOCUS ON PATIENT NEEDS. HOSPITALS WILLING TO INVEST IN SELF-CARE OPTIONS FOR NURSES CAN ANTICIPATE PATIENT AND WORK RELATED BENEFITS.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
13 2771 14 YOGA REDUCES SYMPTOMS OF DISTRESS IN TSUNAMI SURVIVORS IN THE ANDAMAN ISLANDS. A MONTH AFTER THE DECEMBER 2004 TSUNAMI THE EFFECT OF A 1 WEEK YOGA PROGRAM WAS EVALUATED ON SELF RATED FEAR, ANXIETY, SADNESS AND DISTURBED SLEEP IN 47 SURVIVORS IN THE ANDAMAN ISLANDS. POLYGRAPH RECORDINGS OF THE HEART RATE, BREATH RATE AND SKIN RESISTANCE WERE ALSO MADE. AMONG THE 47 PEOPLE, 31 WERE SETTLERS FROM THE MAINLAND (I.E. INDIA, ML GROUP) AND 16 WERE ENDOGENOUS PEOPLE (EP GROUP). THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN SELF RATED FEAR, ANXIETY, SADNESS AND DISTURBED SLEEP IN BOTH GROUPS, AND IN THE HEART AND BREATH RATE IN THE ML GROUP, AND IN THE BREATH RATE ALONE IN THE EP GROUP, FOLLOWING YOGA (P < 0.05, T-TEST). THIS SUGGESTS THAT YOGA PRACTICE MAY BE USEFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF STRESS FOLLOWING A NATURAL DISASTER IN PEOPLE WITH WIDELY DIFFERING SOCIAL, CULTURAL AND SPIRITUAL BELIEFS.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
14 1493 18 INTERPRETIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF A LAWSUIT CONTENDING THAT SCHOOL-BASED YOGA IS RELIGION: A STUDY OF SCHOOL PERSONNEL. THIS STUDY FOCUSED ON THE PERSPECTIVES OF SCHOOL PERSONNEL AFFILIATED WITH THE ENCINITAS UNION SCHOOL DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA FOLLOWING A LAWSUIT ARGUING THAT THEIR YOGA-BASED PROGRAM INCLUDED RELIGION AND THEREFORE WAS UNSUITABLE FOR IMPLEMENTATION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL. PARTICIPANTS (N = 32) WERE INTERVIEWED USING A SEMISTRUCTURED INTERVIEW, AND DATA WERE ANALYZED ACCORDING TO INTERPRETATIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL ANALYSIS. FIVE SUPER-ORDINATE THEMES (INCLUDING SUB-THEMES) WERE IDENTIFIED IN AN ITERATIVE PROCESS, INCLUDING: PARTICIPANTS' PERSPECTIVES ON THE ROOTS OF YOGA AND THE TYPE OF YOGA TAUGHT IN THEIR DISTRICT; THE PROCESS OF INTRODUCING A YOGA-IN-THE-SCHOOLS PROGRAM IN LIGHT OF THIS CONTENTION (INCLUDING CHALLENGES AND OBSTACLES, AND HOW THESE WERE MET); PERSPECTIVES ON THE LAWSUIT AND HOW THE PROCESS UNFOLDED; EFFECTS OF THE LAWSUIT ON SCHOOL CLIMATE AND BEYOND; AND PERSPECTIVES ON YOGA AS, AND AS NOT, RELIGIOUS. THE STUDY ATTEMPTS TO SHED LIGHT ON THE IMPACT OF AN ONGOING LAWSUIT ON A SCHOOL DISTRICT AT THE TIME OF IMPLEMENTATION OF A PROGRAM FOR STUDENTS' WELL BEING.	2017

16  215 16 A STUDY OF YOGA AS A NURSING INTERVENTION IN THE CARE OF PATIENTS WITH PLEURAL EFFUSION. 'PRANAYAMA' OR YOGIC BREATHING AS A METHOD OF RE-EXPANSION OF LUNGS IN PATIENTS WITH PLEURAL EFFUSION WAS STUDIED. TEN PATIENTS WITH PLEURAL EFFUSION PRACTISED ALTERNATE NOSTRIL BREATHING FOR 20 DAYS AFTER ASPIRATION OF FLUID. AN EQUAL NUMBER MATCHED FOR AGE AND SMOKING HABITS UNDERWENT ROUTINE PHYSIOTHERAPY OF THE HOSPITAL FOR THE SAME PERIOD. LUNG FUNCTION WAS MEASURED: BEFORE ASPIRATION; IMMEDIATELY AFTER ASPIRATION; AND, 5, 10, 15 AND 20 DAYS AFTER ASPIRATION. THE FVC, FEV1, MVV, PEFR, CE AND RS, WERE USED TO MEASURE LUNG FUNCTION. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS IN THE GAIN IN LUNG EXPANSION AS ASSESSED BY THE ABOVE MEASURES WAS TESTED FOR SIGNIFICANCE WITH APPROPRIATE NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICAL TESTS AT 0.1 LEVEL OF SIGNIFICANCE. THE RESULTS REVEALED THAT THE PATIENTS PRACTISING PRANAYAMA DEMONSTRATED A QUICKER RE-EXPANSION OF THE LUNGS IN MOST OF THE MEASURES OF LUNG FUNCTION. THE FINDINGS ARE DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING CARE.	1984	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
17 2084 23 THE EFFECT OF LAUGHTER YOGA ON GENERAL HEALTH AMONG NURSING STUDENTS. BACKGROUND: PROMOTION AND PROVISION OF INDIVIDUALS' HEALTH IS ONE OF THE BASES FOR DEVELOPMENT IN SOCIETIES. STUDENTS' MENTAL HEALTH IS VERY IMPORTANT IN EACH SOCIETY. STUDENTS OF MEDICAL SCIENCES UNIVERSITIES, ESPECIALLY NURSING STUDENTS, ARE UNDER VARIOUS STRESSES IN CLINICAL ENVIRONMENT, IN ADDITION TO THE STRESS THEY EXPERIENCE IN THEORETICAL EDUCATION ENVIRONMENT. WITH REGARD TO THE IMPORTANCE OF NURSING STUDENTS' GENERAL HEALTH AND CONSIDERING THE VARIOUS EXISTING STRATEGIES TO PROMOTE GENERAL HEALTH COMPONENTS, USE OF COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENTS IS MORE CONSIDERED BECAUSE OF THEIR BETTER PUBLIC ACCEPTANCE, LOW COSTS, AND FEWER COMPLICATIONS. ONE OF THE NEW STRATEGIES IN THIS REGARD IS LAUGHTER YOGA. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED WITH AN AIM TO DEFINE THE EFFECT OF LAUGHTER YOGA ON GENERAL HEALTH AMONG NURSING STUDENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS IS A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL TWO-GROUP THREE-STEP STUDY CONDUCTED ON 38 MALE NURSING STUDENTS IN THE NURSING AND MIDWIFERY SCHOOL OF ISFAHAN UNIVERSITY OF MEDICAL SCIENCES IN 2012. IN THE STUDY GROUP, EIGHT 1 H SESSIONS OF LAUGHTER YOGA WERE HELD (TWO SESSIONS A WEEK), AND IN THE CONTROL GROUP, NO INTERVENTION WAS CONDUCTED. THE DATA OF THE PRESENT STUDY WERE COLLECTED BY GOLDBERG AND HILLER'S GENERAL HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE AND ANALYZED BY SPSS VERSION 12. RESULTS: THE FINDINGS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE MEAN SCORES OF GENERAL HEALTH BEFORE AND AFTER LAUGHTER YOGA INTERVENTION IN THE TWO GROUPS OF STUDY AND CONTROL. CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS SHOWED THAT LAUGHTER YOGA HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON STUDENTS' GENERAL HEALTH AND IMPROVED THE SIGNS OF PHYSICAL AND SLEEP DISORDERS, LOWERED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, AND PROMOTED THEIR SOCIAL FUNCTION. THEREFORE, LAUGHTER YOGA CAN BE USED AS ONE OF THE EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES ON STUDENTS' GENERAL HEALTH.	2014

20 1660 19 MYPATH: A NOVEL MINDFULNESS AND YOGA-BASED PEER LEADER INTERVENTION TO PREVENT VIOLENCE AMONG YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. YOUNG ADULTS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS (YAEH) ARE AT ELEVATED RISK FOR VIOLENCE VICTIMIZATION AND PERPETRATION. HOWEVER, THERE ARE NO EVIDENCE-BASED VIOLENCE PREVENTION INTERVENTIONS FOR HOMELESS POPULATIONS. THIS STUDY IS AN EVALUATION OF A NOVEL MINDFULNESS-BASED PEER-LEADER INTERVENTION DESIGNED TO REDUCE VIOLENCE AND IMPROVE MINDFULNESS IN YAEH. A SOCIAL NETWORK OF YAEH RECEIVING SERVICES AT A DROP-IN AGENCY WAS RECRUITED IN SUMMER 2018 (N = 106) AND PEER-LEADERS IDENTIFIED AT BASELINE (N = 12). PEER LEADERS WERE TRAINED IN MINDFULNESS AND YOGA SKILLS DURING A 1-DAY INTENSIVE WORKSHOP AND SEVEN 1-H WEEKLY FOLLOW-UP WORKSHOPS AND ENCOURAGED TO SHARE THEIR KNOWLEDGE WITH IN-NETWORK PEERS. POSTINTERVENTION DATA WERE COLLECTED 2 AND 3 MONTHS AFTER BASELINE. TWO ONE-WAY REPEATED-MEASURES ANALYSES OF VARIANCE (ANOVAS) TESTED DIFFERENCES IN MEANS FOR MINDFULNESS AND FIGHTING. ANOVA MODELS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN GROUP MEAN MINDFULNESS F(2, 110) = 3.42, P < 0.05 AND SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN GROUP MEAN VIOLENT BEHAVIOR F(2, 112) = 5.23, P < 0.01 AT THE NETWORK LEVEL. FINDINGS INDICATE A NETWORK-BASED, PEER-LEADER MODEL CAN BE EFFECTIVE FOR INFLUENCING COMPLEX, SOCIALLY CONDITIONED ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS AMONG YAEH. ADDITIONAL ADVANTAGES OF THE PEER-LEADER MODEL INCLUDE RELATIVELY FEW DIRECT-SERVICE PERSON-HOURS REQUIRED FROM PROVIDERS AND CONVENIENCE TO PARTICIPANTS ABLE PRACTICE SKILLS IN THEIR RELEVANT SOCIAL CONTEXTS.	2022

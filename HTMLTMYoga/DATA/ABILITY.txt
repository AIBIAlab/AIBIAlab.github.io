1  156 135 A QUALITATIVE STUDY OF LOVEYOURBRAIN YOGA: A GROUP-BASED YOGA WITH PSYCHOEDUCATION INTERVENTION TO FACILITATE COMMUNITY INTEGRATION FOR PEOPLE WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. PURPOSE: TO EXPLORE PARTICIPANTS' EXPERIENCES IN A GROUP-BASED YOGA WITH PSYCHOEDUCATION INTERVENTION DESIGNED TO FACILITATE COMMUNITY INTEGRATION FOR PEOPLE WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS.MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE CONDUCTED SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH 13 PEOPLE WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND THREE CAREGIVERS WHO HAD COMPLETED LOVEYOURBRAIN YOGA, A 6-SESSION, MANUALIZED, GROUP-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION THAT INCORPORATES BREATHING EXERCISES, YOGA, MEDITATION, AND PSYCHOEDUCATION. INTERVIEWS WERE ANALYZED USING CONTENT ANALYSIS.RESULTS: WE IDENTIFIED SEVEN THEMES: EASE OF PARTICIPATION, BELONGING, SUSTAINING COMMUNITY CONNECTION, PHYSICAL HEALTH, SELF-REGULATION, SELF-EFFICACY, AND RESILIENCE. ALL PARTICIPANTS VALUED THE COMMUNITY-BASED YOGA STUDIO ENVIRONMENT AND MULTIFACETED STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM. PARTICIPANTS REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN STRENGTH, BALANCE, FLEXIBILITY, AND ATTENTION CONTROL, AND A GREATER SENSE OF BELONGING, COMMUNITY CONNECTION, AND ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR LIVES. PARTICIPANTS REPORTED ONGOING USE OF TOOLS (E.G., BREATHING EXERCISES) TO COPE WITH NEGATIVE EMOTIONS AND STRESS. ABOUT HALF OF PARTICIPANTS SUSTAINED RELATIONSHIPS BUILT DURING LOVEYOURBRAIN YOGA AND FELT MORE CAPABLE OF ACCESSING OTHER ACTIVITIES IN THEIR COMMUNITY.CONCLUSIONS: LOVEYOURBRAIN YOGA SUCCESSFULLY PROMOTED COMMUNITY INTEGRATION FOR PEOPLE WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY. IT ALSO FACILITATED DIVERSE AND MEANINGFUL PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND SOCIAL HEALTH BENEFITS, WHICH SUGGEST THAT IT MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE MODE OF COMMUNITY-BASED REHABILITATION.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONTRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY SURVIVORS OFTEN STRUGGLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR COMMUNITY, THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF REHABILITATIONYOGA IS A HOLISTIC THERAPY WITH MANY BENEFITS, YET IS NOT ACCESSIBLE TO THE TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY POPULATION AT THE COMMUNITY LEVELPARTICIPANTS IN A COMMUNITY-BASED YOGA WITH PSYCHOEDUCATION INTERVENTION IN SIX STATES EXPERIENCED DIVERSE AND MEANINGFUL PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND SOCIAL HEALTH BENEFITSGROUP-BASED YOGA WITH PSYCHOEDUCATION MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE MODE OF COMMUNITY INTEGRATION AND COMMUNITY-BASED REHABILITATION FOR TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY SURVIVORS.	2020	

2    5  33 "I JUST FIND IT EASIER TO LET GO OF ANGER": REFLECTIONS ON THE WAYS IN WHICH YOGA INFLUENCES HOW YOUNG PEOPLE MANAGE THEIR EMOTIONS. IN THIS ARTICLE WE DISCUSS HOW YOUNG PEOPLE EXPERIENCED A SCHOOL-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION. WE PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO HOW YOGA PROVIDES A SPACE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO DEAL WITH THEIR EMOTIONS. WE BASE OUR DISCUSSION ON QUALITATIVE DATA FROM YOUNG PEOPLE IN NORWAY WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE EUROPEAN RESEARCH PROJECT "HIPPOCAMPUS: PROMOTING MENTAL HEALTH AND WELLBEING AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE THROUGH YOGA." THE QUALITATIVE RESULTS ARE BASED ON EXPERIENCES DESCRIBED BY THESE YOUNG PEOPLE IN INDIVIDUAL SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS AND IN DIARIES OR LOGS. OUR DATA INCLUDE NINE INTERVIEWS PERFORMED IN THE SPRING OF 2019 WITH YOUNG PEOPLE OF NORWEGIAN AND REFUGEE BACKGROUND IN THEIR LATE TEENS AND EARLY TWENTIES. THERE WERE ALSO 133 LOGS NOTED BY THE STUDENTS EXPOSED TO THE YOGA INTERVENTION. IN THE QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS, YOUNG PEOPLE TALK ABOUT YOGA AND EMOTIONAL MANAGEMENT, IMPROVED SLEEP HABITS, AND REGULATION. THEY ALSO REPORT IMPROVED ABILITY TO REGULATE AND COPE WITH STRESS. YOGA SEEMED ESPECIALLY BENEFICIAL FOR REFUGEE TRAUMA. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE HAVE CHOSEN TO FOCUS ON THE UTTERANCES OF YOUNG PEOPLE ABOUT EMOTIONS, AS THOSE WERE QUITE DOMINANT IN OUR DATA, ESPECIALLY IN THE INTERVIEW MATERIAL. WE HAVE IDENTIFIED INSTANCES OF EMOTIONAL REGULATION, BUT ALSO OF EMOTIONAL PROCESSES AND CHANGES OF EMOTIONS, ALL OF WHICH WERE RELATED TO THESE YOUNG STUDENTS PRACTICING YOGA. THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON EMOTIONS ILLUSTRATES THE POTENTIAL OF YOGA TO IMPROVE THE WELL-BEING AND MENTAL HEALTH OF YOUNG PEOPLE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
3 2281  33 THE SUITABILITY OF YOGA AS A POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS: A FOCUS GROUP APPROACH. OBJECTIVES: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE THE VIEWS OF PATIENTS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA) REGARDING THE SUITABILITY OF YOGA AS A POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION IN THE MANAGEMENT OF RA. METHODS: TWENTY-TWO PARTICIPANTS WITH RA WERE RECRUITED FROM OUTPATIENT CLINICS AT A REGIONAL HOSPITAL IN NEW ZEALAND AND DIVIDED INTO FOUR FOCUS GROUPS. HETEROGENEITY BETWEEN GROUPS IN TERMS OF AGE, GENDER, DURATION OF RA AND FUNCTIONAL ABILITY PROVIDED OPINIONS FROM A CROSS-SECTION OF RA PATIENTS. TRANSCRIPTS WERE ANALYSED USING THEMATIC ANALYSIS, WITH FOUR THEMES PREDOMINATING. RESULTS: FIRSTLY, PARTICIPANTS DESCRIBED THEIR EXPERIENCE OF SYMPTOMS RELATED TO THEIR RA IN THREE INDEPENDENT BUT LINKED CATEGORIES OF PHYSICAL, MENTAL AND SOCIAL WELL-BEING. SECONDLY, PARTICIPANTS PERCEIVED THE MANAGEMENT OF THEIR RA TO BE PRESCRIPTIVE, MEDICALIZED AND FAILING TO ADDRESS THEIR WIDER HEALTH CONCERNS. THIRDLY, PARTICIPANTS PERCEIVED YOGA AS A SAFE, ADAPTABLE THERAPY THAT MAY ALLOW SELF-MANAGEMENT OF THEIR RA. HOWEVER, THERE WAS SOME CONCERN THAT FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS MAY INHIBIT ABILITY TO PRACTISE THE PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF YOGA. FOURTHLY, REQUIREMENTS FOR A YOGA INTERVENTION THAT WOULD BE FEASIBLE FOR PEOPLE WITH RA WERE PRESENTED BY PARTICIPANTS. CONCLUSIONS: PATIENTS WITH RA PERCEIVE A DISPARITY BETWEEN THEIR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF LIVING WITH RA AND THEIR CURRENT MEDICAL MANAGEMENT. YOGA IS PERCEIVED AS A POTENTIAL THERAPY TO ADDRESS THIS DISPARITY. BASED ON OPINIONS EXPRESSED BY PARTICIPANTS, FUTURE RESEARCH REGARDING A YOGA INTERVENTION AS AN ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY FOR MANAGING RA SHOULD MEET PATIENTS' VIEWS ON FEASIBILITY AND TEST OUTCOME MEASURES REFLECTING THE DOMAINS OF PHYSICAL, MENTAL AND SOCIAL WELL-BEING.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
4 2574  36 YOGA FOR EVERYONE: A QUALITATIVE STUDY OF A COMMUNITY YOGA CLASS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITY. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: PEOPLE WITH MOBILITY IMPAIRMENTS FACE INCREASED BARRIERS TO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. THE STUDY AIMED TO UNDERSTAND THE LIVED EXPERIENCES OF INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITY WHO ARE REGULAR PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA FOR EVERYONE CLASS TO INFORM FUTURE RESEARCH, INTERVENTION AND COMMUNITY PROGRAMS.METHODS: A PHENOMENOLOGICAL QUALITATIVE APPROACH UTILIZED SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS AND CLASS OBSERVATIONS. DATA WAS ANALYZED THROUGH ITERATIVE INDUCTIVE THEMATIC ANALYSIS.RESULTS: SIX PEOPLE OF VARIED MOBILITY LIMITATIONS PARTICIPATED. THEMATIC ANALYSIS REVEALED THEMES ON INFLUENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND PERSONAL FACTORS, A HOLISTIC-FOCUSED CLASS ENVIRONMENT, PHYSICAL IMPROVEMENTS, MENTAL/EMOTIONAL IMPACT, AND A SENSE OF BELONGING TO COMMUNITY.CONCLUSION: THE YOGA FOR EVERYONE CLASS FOSTERED MULTI-FACETED OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE WITH DIVERSE MOVEMENT IMPAIRMENTS. FOCUSING ON COMMUNITY-CLINICAL PARTNERSHIPS, UTILIZING A CLASS STRUCTURE WITH VOLUNTEERS, AND FOSTERING AN ONGOING INCLUSIVE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT ARE POTENTIAL STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS IN OTHER COMMUNITY PROGRAMS FOR THOSE WITH DISABILITY.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
5   21  32 "YOGA RESETS MY INNER PEACE BAROMETER": A QUALITATIVE STUDY ILLUMINATING THE PATHWAYS OF HOW YOGA IMPACTS ONE'S RELATIONSHIP TO ONESELF AND TO OTHERS. OBJECTIVES: THE PURPOSE OF THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY WAS TWOFOLD: (1) TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW YOGA PRACTITIONERS PERCEIVE INTRA- AND INTERPERSONAL OUTCOMES OF THEIR YOGA PRACTICE, AND (2) TO DEVELOP A CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF YOGA EFFECTS ON INTRA- AND INTERPERSONAL OUTCOMES THAT MAY UNDERLIE THE "RELATIONAL" INFLUENCES OF YOGA. DESIGN: AS PART OF A LARGER STUDY, 107 COMMUNITY-DWELLING YOGA PRACTITIONERS (AGE M=41.2+/-15.9YEARS) COMPLETED OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS WHICH ASKED QUESTIONS FOCUSING ON WHETHER YOGA INFLUENCES ONE'S RELATIONSHIP TO ONESELF AND TO OTHERS. A SUBSAMPLE (N=12) COMPLETED IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS. THE OPEN-ENDED RESPONSES WERE ANALYZED USING CONTENT ANALYSIS, AND VERBATIM INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTS WERE ANALYZED FOR EMERGENT THEMES USING A CONSTANT COMPARISON APPROACH. RESULTS: FOUR EMERGING THEMES WERE IDENTIFIED SUCH THAT PRACTITIONERS TALKED ABOUT THE ABILITY OF YOGA TO GENERATE CALM STATES, MINDFULNESS, (SELF-)COMPASSION, AND A SENSE OF CONNECTEDNESS. THROUGHOUT THE THEMES, A COMMON PATTERN EMERGED SUCH THAT YOGA PRACTICE FIRST LED TO POSITIVE INTRAPERSONAL CHANGES, WHICH THEN INFLUENCED ONE'S INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS. BASED ON THESE RESULTS, A CONCEPTUAL MODEL WAS DEVELOPED DEPICTING POTENTIAL PATHWAYS OF HOW YOGA WORKS TO ENHANCE RELATIONAL OUTCOMES. CONCLUSION: FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE THE PROMISE YOGA HOLDS TO IMPROVE ONE'S RELATIONSHIP TO ONESELF (INTRAPERSONAL) THROUGH MINDFULNESS AND SELF-COMPASSION, AND TO OTHERS (INTERPERSONAL), THROUGH THE ENHANCEMENT OF COMPASSION AND SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS, WHICH MAY POTENTIALLY LEAD TO ENHANCED HEALTH AND WELLBEING OUTCOMES. FURTHER EMPIRICAL TESTING OF THE MODEL IS WARRANTED.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
6 2284  34 THE USE OF YOGA AS A GROUP INTERVENTION FOR PEDIATRIC CHRONIC PAIN REHABILITATION: EXPLORING QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE OUTCOMES. PURPOSE: WITH THE INCREASE IN OPIOID USE OVER THE LAST DECADE, MIND-BODY APPROACHES TO PEDIATRIC PAIN MANAGEMENT HAVE BEEN TRENDING. TO DATE, THERE IS LIMITED RESEARCH REGARDING THE USE OF YOGA WITH PEDIATRIC CHRONIC PAIN. THIS STUDY AIMS TO GAUGE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF GROUP YOGA AS PART OF CHRONIC PAIN REHABILITATION AND ONE'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE PRACTICING INDEPENDENTLY BY EXPLORING QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION. METHODS: A SINGLE THERAPIST USED YOGA AS A GROUP PHYSICAL THERAPY INTERVENTION ONCE A WEEK FOR 60 MINUTES. YOGA EDUCATION, IYENGAR YOGA COMPONENTS, RELAXATION, AND STRETCHING WERE INCORPORATED INTO THE THERAPEUTIC YOGA SESSION. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION WAS COLLECTED. RESULTS: QUALITATIVE OUTCOMES PROVIDED VALUABLE DATA ABOUT DISTRACTIONS AND BENEFITS. QUANTITATIVE OUTCOMES SHOWED THAT THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN AREAS SUCH AS MENTAL TENSION, EMOTIONAL TENSION, MUSCLE TENSION, AND PAIN (ALL P < 0.001 SIGNIFICANT). CONCLUSION: PEDIATRIC CHRONIC PAIN PATIENTS CAN IDENTIFY MANY BENEFITS AFTER A SINGLE GROUP YOGA SESSION. IT COMBINES THE PHYSICAL AND COGNITIVE ASPECTS OF INTERDISCIPLINARY PAIN REHABILITATION FOR CONTINUED USE AFTER DISCHARGE. THE USE OF YOGA IS AN ECONOMICAL MEANS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AFTER DISCHARGE TO PROMOTE LONG-TERM BENEFITS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
7  380  41 BECOMING CONNECTED: THE LIVED EXPERIENCE OF YOGA PARTICIPATION AFTER STROKE. PURPOSE: TO INVESTIGATE THE PERSONAL EXPERIENCES AND PERCEIVED OUTCOMES OF A YOGA PROGRAMME FOR STROKE SURVIVORS. METHOD: THIS ARTICLE REPORTS ON A PRELIMINARY STUDY USING QUALITATIVE METHODS TO INVESTIGATE THE PERSONAL EXPERIENCES AND PERCEIVED OUTCOMES OF A YOGA PROGRAMME. NINE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD EXPERIENCED STROKE WERE INTERVIEWED FOLLOWING A 10-WEEK YOGA PROGRAMME INVOLVING MOVEMENT, BREATHING AND MEDITATION PRACTICES. AN INTERPRETATIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL APPROACH WAS USED TO DETERMINE MEANINGS ATTACHED TO YOGA PARTICIPATION AS WELL AS PERCEPTIONS OF OUTCOMES. RESULTS: INTERPRETATIVE THEMES EVOLVING FROM THE DATA WERE ORGANISED AROUND A BIO-PSYCHOSOCIAL MODEL OF HEALTH BENEFITS FROM YOGA. EMERGENT THEMES FROM THE ANALYSIS INCLUDED: GREATER SENSATION; FEELING CALMER AND BECOMING CONNECTED. THESE THEMES RESPECTIVELY REVEALED PERCEIVED PHYSICAL IMPROVEMENTS IN TERMS OF STRENGTH, RANGE OF MOVEMENT OR WALKING ABILITY, AN IMPROVED SENSE OF CALMNESS AND THE POSSIBILITY FOR RECONNECTING AND ACCEPTING A DIFFERENT BODY. CONCLUSION: THE STUDY HAS GENERATED ORIGINAL FINDINGS THAT SUGGEST THAT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD A STROKE YOGA PARTICIPATION CAN PROVIDE A NUMBER OF MEANINGFUL PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL BENEFITS AND SUPPORT THE RATIONALE FOR INCORPORATING YOGA AND MEDITATION-BASED PRACTICES INTO REHABILITATION PROGRAMMES.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
8  151  43 A QUALITATIVE INVESTIGATION TO INFORM YOGA INTERVENTION RECRUITMENT PRACTICES FOR RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY ADOLESCENTS IN OUTPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. OBJECTIVE: YOGA IS RECOGNIZED AS AN EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO IMPROVING OVERALL PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH; HOWEVER, THERE MAY BE PERCEIVED BARRIERS TO YOGA PARTICIPATION, PARTICULARLY AMONG POPULATIONS MOST AT RISK FOR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. WE CONDUCTED QUALITATIVE FORMATIVE RESEARCH TO HELP INFORM RECRUITMENT PRACTICES FOR A FUTURE STUDY AND TO SPECIFICALLY UNDERSTAND THE BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO ENGAGEMENT IN YOGA PRACTICE AMONG RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY ADOLESCENTS, AS WELL AS ADOLESCENTS IN OUTPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. METHODS: QUALITATIVE DATA WERE COLLECTED AT A COMMUNITY HEALTH CLINIC THAT SERVES LOW INCOME FAMILIES IN SOUTHEASTERN FLORIDA. USING SEMI STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY ADOLESCENTS BETWEEN 12 AND 17 YEARS OLD, PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED ABOUT BELIEFS AND PERCEPTIONS ABOUT YOGA, AS WELL AS RECOMMENDATIONS ON RECRUITING PEERS. A THEMATIC ANALYSIS APPROACH WAS USED TO IDENTIFY AND EXAMINE COMMON THEMES. RESULTS: TWENTY INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED AND EIGHT MAJOR THEMES EMERGED FROM THE DATA. THEMES WERE GROUPED AS (1) FACILITATORS TO RECRUITMENT AND (2) BARRIERS TO RECRUITMENT. INTERPRETATION: ADVERTISING FREE YOGA THAT EMPHASIZES THE SOCIAL, PHYSICAL, AND MENTAL BENEFITS CAN HELP ASSUAGE NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OF YOGA AND PROMOTE THE ADVANTAGES OF YOGA AMONG TEENAGERS. HAVING RECRUITMENT MATERIALS AND MODALITIES THAT HIGHLIGHT INCLUSIVITY OF ALL GENDERS AND PHYSICAL ABILITIES IN THE YOGA CLASSES ARE ALSO IMPORTANT IN FACILITATING PARTICIPATION. UNDERSTANDING PERCEPTIONS OF YOGA, AS WELL AS PERCEIVED BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS, AMONG RACIALLY/ETHNICALLY DIVERSE ADOLESCENTS IN OUTPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT, CAN ASSIST RECRUITMENT EFFORTS, INCREASE YOGA INTERVENTION PARTICIPATION, AND ULTIMATELY, IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
9 2767  38 YOGA PROVISION FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: IS THE FUTURE ONLINE? BACKGROUND: YOGA HAS MULTIPLE BENEFITS FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS), INCLUDING REDUCED PAIN, DEPRESSION, FATIGUE, STRENGTH, AND IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE. DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, HOME-BASED DELIVERY OF YOGA INCREASED. HOWEVER, NO STUDIES TO DATE HAVE EXPLORED ONLINE HOME-BASED YOGA FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MS, MORE SPECIFICALLY THE MOTIVATIONS, EXPERIENCES, OR THE SUSTAINABILITY OF HOME-BASED YOGA PRACTICE FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MS. AIM: THIS STUDY AIMED TO EXPLORE THE FACILITATORS AND BARRIERS OF ONLINE YOGA PROVISION FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MS. METHODS: ONE FOCUS GROUP AND THREE SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE CARRIED OUT ONLINE VIA ZOOM WITH ONE YOGA INSTRUCTOR AND SEVEN YOGA PARTICIPANTS LIVING WITH MS. THEMATIC ANALYSIS WAS USED TO ANALYSE THIS DATA. FINDINGS: TWO THEMES WERE GENERATED FROM THE INTERVIEWS, THE ENVIRONMENT AND FUTURE PROVISION, EACH WITH THEIR OWN SUB-THEMES. THE THEMES REFLECT VARIOUS FACILITATORS AND BARRIERS OF HOME-BASED YOGA PROVISION WHICH DIFFERED DEPENDING UPON THE INDIVIDUALS HOME ENVIRONMENT, SOCIAL CONNECTIONS, PHYSICAL ABILITY, AND CONFIDENCE PRACTISING YOGA. FURTHERMORE, PREFERENCES OF HOME PROVISION FLUCTUATED OVER TIME DEPENDING UPON SYMPTOMS OF MS. CONCLUSIONS: HOME-BASED YOGA PRACTICE IS A VIABLE AND ENJOYABLE OPTION FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MS. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOGA STUDIOS OFFERING HOME-BASED YOGA PROVISION CONSIDER INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN PREFERENCE, AS WELL AS FLUCTUATIONS IN SYMPTOMS THAT MAY CREATE INEQUITABLE ACCESS TO SERVICES AND MAY PREVENT PARTICIPATION FOR SOME.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
10  148  27 A QUALITATIVE EXPLORATION OF IMPLEMENTATION FACTORS IN A SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PROGRAM: LESSONS LEARNED FROM STUDENTS AND TEACHERS. IDENTIFYING FACTORS RELEVANT FOR SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF SCHOOL-BASED INTERVENTIONS IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THAT PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED IN AN EFFECTIVE AND ENGAGING MANNER. THE PERSPECTIVES OF TWO KEY STAKEHOLDERS CRITICAL FOR IDENTIFYING IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS - STUDENTS AND THEIR CLASSROOM TEACHERS - MERIT ATTENTION IN THIS CONTEXT AND HAVE RARELY BEEN EXPLORED USING QUALITATIVE METHODS. THIS STUDY REPORTS QUALITATIVE PERSPECTIVES OF FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADE PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR TEACHERS OF A 16-WEEK SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PROGRAM IN THREE PUBLIC SCHOOLS SERVING LOW-INCOME URBAN COMMUNITIES. FOUR THEMES RELATED TO PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS EMERGED: PROGRAM DELIVERY FACTORS, PROGRAM BUY-IN, IMPLEMENTER COMMUNICATION WITH TEACHERS, AND INSTRUCTOR QUALITIES. FEEDBACK FROM STUDENTS AND TEACHERS IS DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT OF INFORMING IMPLEMENTATION, ADAPTATION, AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PROGRAMMING IN URBAN SETTINGS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
11 1711  28 PERCEIVED BENEFITS AND BARRIERS TO YOGA PARTICIPATION AFTER STROKE: A FOCUS GROUP APPROACH. BACKGROUND: AND PURPOSE: THERE IS INCREASING EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST YOGA CAN BE BENEFICIAL TO HEALTH AND WELLBEING AFTER STROKE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO IDENTIFY PERCEIVED BENEFITS AND BARRIERS TO YOGA PARTICIPATION AMONG ADULTS WITH CHRONIC STROKE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TWENTY-SIX COMMUNITY DWELLING ADULTS (14 FEMALE, 12 MALE) WHO WERE AT LEAST 6-MONTHS POST-STROKE PARTICIPATED IN FOUR FOCUS GROUPS HELD AT LOCAL STROKE RECOVERY MEETINGS. DATA WAS RECORDED AND TRANSCRIPTS WERE ANALYSED THEMATICALLY. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS IDENTIFIED WHOLE BODY BENEFITS, THE RETURN OF CONNECTION AND FEELING HEALTH IN MIND AS THE PRIMARY BENEFITS OF YOGA. PERCEIVED BARRIERS INCLUDED PHYSICAL BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATION, COGNITIVE CHALLENGES, ENVIRONMENTAL ACCESS, AND FINANCIAL LIMITATIONS. CONCLUSION: STROKE SURVIVORS PERCEIVE YOGA PRACTICE PROVIDES BENEFITS IN 'CONNECTEDNESS'. FUTURE INTERVENTIONS SHOULD RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF YOGA INSTRUCTOR TRAINING, FOCUS ON THE MIND-BODY CONNECTION ASPECTS OF YOGA, AND MODIFYING ACTIVITIES TO SAFELY ACCOMMODATE THE PHYSICAL ABILITIES OF THE PARTICIPANTS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
12 1725  27 PERCEPTIONS OF YOGA THERAPY EMBEDDED IN TWO INPATIENT REHABILITATION HOSPITALS: AGENCY PERSPECTIVES. INPATIENT MEDICAL REHABILITATION HAS MAINTAINED A TYPICAL MEDICAL-MODEL FOCUS AND STRUCTURE FOR MANY YEARS. HOWEVER, AS INTEGRATIVE THERAPIES, SUCH AS YOGA THERAPY, EMERGE AS TREATMENTS WHICH CAN ENHANCE THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OF ITS PARTICIPANTS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO DETERMINE IF THEY CAN BE EASILY IMPLEMENTED INTO THE TRADITIONAL REHABILITATION STRUCTURE AND MILIEU. THEREFORE, THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE PERCEPTIONS OF KEY AGENCY PERSONNEL ON THE FEASIBILITY AND UTILITY OF YOGA THERAPY IMPLEMENTED IN INPATIENT REHABILITATION. THIS STUDY REPORTS THE RESULTS OF FOCUS GROUPS AND AN INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEW WITH KEY STAKEHOLDERS (ADMINISTRATORS AND REHABILITATION THERAPISTS) FROM TWO REHABILITATION HOSPITALS FOLLOWING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF YOGA THERAPY. RESULTS FOCUSED ON SEVERAL KEY THEMES: FEASIBILITY FROM THE THERAPIST AND ADMINISTRATOR PERSPECTIVES, CHALLENGES TO IMPLEMENTATION, AND UTILITY AND BENEFIT. OVERALL, THE IMPLEMENTATION AND INTEGRATION OF YOGA THERAPY WERE POSITIVE; HOWEVER, SOME PROGRAMMATIC AND POLICY AND ORGANIZATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS REMAIN. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND FUTURE RESEARCH ARE PROVIDED.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
13 2430  31 YOGA AND PHYSICAL REHABILITATION MEDICINE: A RESEARCH PARTNERSHIP IN INTEGRATIVE CARE. MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS YOGA, THAT TEACH STRESS MANAGEMENT WITH PHYSICAL ACTIVITY MAY BE WELL SUITED FOR INVESTIGATION IN BOTH OSTEOARTHRITIS AND RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED AS VIABLE CARE OPTIONS INTEGRATIVE STUDIES NEED TO OFFER A COMPREHENSIVE DESIGN AND INCLUDE CLINICIANS FAMILIAR WITH THE DISEASE PROCESS OF THE STUDY POPULATIONS. A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE REVEALS A DEARTH OF INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COLLABORATION BETWEEN YOGA AND PHYSICAL REHABILITATION MEDICINE. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE COLLABORATION WITH PHYSICAL REHABILITATION MEDICINE TO COLLECT RELEVANT PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION MEASURES FOR AN ON-GOING PILOT ACCEPTABILITY/FEASIBILITY YOGA STUDY FOR MINORITY PATIENTS WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS OR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. AN INTERDISCIPLINARY CLINICAL RESEARCH TEAM SELECTED PSYCHOSOCIAL AND PHYSICAL MEASURES FOR A COMMUNITY SAMPLE OF BILINGUAL MINORITY PATIENTS, NOT TYPICALLY IDENTIFIED AS PRACTICING YOGA. SIXTEEN FEMALE ADULTS AGED 40-63 YEARS (MEAN =51) COMPLETED BASELINE PHYSICAL ASSESSMENTS USING SINGLE LEG STANCE, FUNCTIONAL REACH TEST, TIME UP AND GO TEST, TIMED UP FROM THE FLOOR TEST AND THE DISABILITIES OF THE ARM, SHOULDER AND HAND MEASURES. BASELINE VALUES SHOW AN AVERAGE LEVEL OF FUNCTIONAL ABILITY PRIOR TO BEGINNING THE INTERVENTION. PRELIMINARY RESULTS INDICATE SOME IMPROVEMENT; HOWEVER, SELECTED MEASURES MAY NOT HAVE THE SENSITIVITY AND SPECIFICITY NEEDED TO IDENTIFY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. IN THIS STUDY, COMBINING INTERDISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVES ENHANCED THE QUALITY OF THE RESEARCH STUDY DESIGN. THE EXPERIENCE OF THIS INTERDISCIPLINARY CLINICAL RESEARCH TEAM OPENS THE DISCUSSION FOR FUTURE COLLABORATIONS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
14 2219  27 THE IMPACT OF AN AUTONOMY-SUPPORTIVE YOGA INTERVENTION ON SELF-DETERMINATION IN ADULTS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF AN AUTONOMY-SUPPORTIVE YOGA INTERVENTION ON THE SELF-DETERMINATION OF ADULTS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. RESEARCH SUPPORTS THE USE OF AUTONOMY-SUPPORTIVE INTERVENTIONS TO INCREASE POSITIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES WITH THIS POPULATION. THE PRESENT STUDY UTILIZED A QUALITATIVE APPROACH WITH EIGHT SUBJECTS PARTICIPATING IN SEMI-STRUCTURED QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS. CONTENT ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED SUPPORT FOR THREE THEMES RELATED TO THE IMPACT OF YOGA: AUTONOMY, RELATEDNESS, COMPETENCE. THE RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT THE YOGA INTERVENTION MAY SUPPORT SELF-DETERMINATION FOR ADULTS WITH IDD, AS THE PARTICIPANTS' RESPONSES DEMONSTRATED INCREASED FEELINGS OF AUTONOMY, COMPETENCE, AND RELATEDNESS. THE RESULTS ALSO INDICATED THAT AN AUTONOMY-SUPPORTIVE YOGA INTERVENTION CAN BE ACHIEVED WITH ADULTS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES BY TARGETING THE KEY CONSTRUCTS OF AUTONOMY, RELATEDNESS, AND COMPETENCE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
15  152  36 A QUALITATIVE STUDY EXPLORING COMMUNITY YOGA PRACTICE IN ADULTS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. OBJECTIVE: YOGA MAY IMPROVE PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND REDUCE DISEASE SYMPTOMS IN ADULTS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA). HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW PATIENTS WITH RA ARE PRACTICING YOGA IN THE COMMUNITY. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE COMMUNITY YOGA PRACTICE CHARACTERISTICS AND THOUGHTS ABOUT YOGA PRACTICE FOR ADULTS WITH RA. DESIGN: PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED A SEMI-STRUCTURED TELEPHONE INTERVIEW WITH OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS. THEMATIC ANALYSIS WAS USED TO ANALYZE INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTS. PARTICIPANTS: A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF 17 ADULTS WITH RHEUMATOLOGIST-DIAGNOSED RA WHO HAD PARTICIPATED IN YOGA WITHIN THE PAST YEAR WERE ASKED ABOUT THE DECISION TO START, CONTINUE, AND STOP YOGA; THE PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF YOGA; COMPONENTS OF YOGA SESSIONS; AND GENERAL THOUGHTS ABOUT YOGA AS IT RELATES TO RA. RESULTS: ALTHOUGH EIGHT DIFFERENT STYLES OF YOGA WERE PRACTICED, COMMONALITIES IN YOGA CLASS COMPONENTS (SUCH AS STRETCHING, STRENGTHENING, DEEP BREATHING, MEDITATION, AND POSITIVE MESSAGING FROM THE INSTRUCTOR) REVEAL EXAMPLES OF PREFERRED TYPES OF YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH RA. THREE MAIN THEMES EMERGED, EACH WITH MULTIPLE SUBTHEMES: (1) MOTIVATORS (PHYSICAL FITNESS, INFLUENCE OF OTHERS, REDUCED PRICE), (2) BARRIERS (COST, SYMPTOM BURDEN, CLASS DIFFICULTY), AND (3) BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE (MIND-BODY, A TOOL FOR COPING, PRIDE/ACHIEVEMENT, SOCIAL, AND "YOGA MEETS YOU WHERE YOU ARE"). CONCLUSION: IN THIS STUDY, PATIENTS WITH RA DESCRIBED HOW YOGA PRACTICE HELPED IMPROVE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL SYMPTOMS RELATED TO THEIR DISEASE. YOGA PRACTICE, A DYNAMIC EXERCISE, ENCOMPASSING MANY DIFFERENT STYLES, CAN PROVIDE MANY BENEFITS FOR ADULTS WITH RA; HOWEVER, YOGA MAY NOT BE BENEFICIAL FOR EVERY ADULT WITH RA.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
16 2259  27 THE PRACTICABILITY AND RELEVANCE OF DEVELOPING A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR MENTAL HEALTH CONSUMERS: A QUALITATIVE STUDY. THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO UNDERSTAND THE PERSPECTIVES OF MENTAL HEALTH CONSUMERS, STAFF, AND YOGA TEACHERS ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF A YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION TO BE DEVELOPED FOR CONSUMERS WITH A LONG-TERM MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION, IN ADDITION TO ANXIETY AND/OR DEPRESSION. TWO FOCUS GROUPS WERE HELD WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONSUMERS (N = 8), TWO FOCUS GROUPS WITH MENTAL HEALTH STAFF (N = 13) FROM A METROPOLITAN COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH SETTING, AND FIVE ONE-ON-ONE INTERVIEWS WITH YOGA TEACHERS. PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED ABOUT THE FEASIBILITY AND APPROPRIATENESS OF A RANGE OF YOGA PRACTICE FEATURES TO BE TESTED AS A NEWLY DEVELOPED YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION. THEMATIC ANALYSIS WAS USED TO IDENTIFY THEMES. FINDINGS INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING CONSUMER THEMES: MENTAL HEALTH UNDERSTANDING AND EXPERIENCE OF TEACHERS AND PARTICIPANTS IS IMPORTANT, CREATING A SAFE SPACE AND YOGA PRACTICE ELEMENTS. STAFF THEMES INCLUDED MENTAL HEALTH UNDERSTANDING AND EXPERIENCE OF TEACHERS IS IMPORTANT, ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN, AND YOGA PRACTICE ELEMENTS. YOGA TEACHER THEMES INCLUDED ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN AND YOGA PRACTICE ELEMENTS. MENTAL HEALTH UNDERSTANDING AND EXPERIENCE OF THE YOGA TEACHER, AND TRAUMA-INFORMED CARE WERE CONSISTENTLY EMPHASIZED BY CONSUMERS AND STAFF. TEACHERS FOCUSED LESS ON SPECIFIC MENTAL HEALTH CONSIDERATIONS, WHICH MAY BE REFLECTIVE OF A BROADER KNOWLEDGE GAP. RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING YOGA PRACTICE ELEMENTS, INCLUDING PRE-INFORMATION, REGULAR AND CONSISTENT PRACTICE, MODIFICATIONS, BREATHWORK, MINDFULNESS AND GUIDED PRACTICE, AND ENVIRONMENTAL DESIGN FEATURES, WERE CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA RESEARCH. FINDINGS WILL BE USED TO GUIDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION FOR CONSUMERS WITH A LONG-TERM MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION, IN ADDITION TO ANXIETY AND/OR DEPRESSION.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
17 2493  30 YOGA AS COPING: A CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR MEANINGFUL PARTICIPATION IN YOGA. YOGA FACILITATES RELAXATION AND CONNECTION OF MIND, BODY, AND SPIRIT THROUGH THE USE OF BREATHING, MEDITATION, AND PHYSICAL POSTURES. PARTICIPATION IN YOGA HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY LINKED TO DECREASED STRESS, AND AS A RESULT, IS CONSIDERED A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION BY MANY. HOWEVER, FEW THEORIES EXIST THAT EXPLAIN THE LINK BETWEEN YOGA PARTICIPATION AND IMPROVED PSYCHOSOCIAL WELLBEING. THE LEISURE-STRESS COPING CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK SUGGESTS THAT THROUGH PARTICIPATION IN LEISURE, AN INDIVIDUAL CAN DECREASE STRESS WHILE CONCURRENTLY RESTORING AND BUILDING UP SUSTAINABLE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL CAPACITIES. THREE TYPES OF LEISURE COPING STRATEGIES EXIST: PALLIATIVE COPING, MOOD ENHANCEMENT, AND COMPANIONSHIP. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO PROPOSE THE LEISURE-STRESS COPING CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK AS A MODEL FOR EXPLAINING BENEFITS RECEIVED FROM YOGA PARTICIPATION VIA LEISURE COPING STRATEGIES, WHICH MAY EXPLAIN OR SUPPORT IMPROVED ABILITY TO MANAGE STRESS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
18 1155  33 ENHANCING YOGA PARTICIPATION: A QUALITATIVE INVESTIGATION OF BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO YOGA AMONG PREDOMINANTLY RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY, LOW-INCOME ADULTS. YOGA IS UNDERUTILIZED AMONG RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES AND LOW-INCOME POPULATIONS. TO ENHANCE PARTICIPATION AMONG THESE DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS AND TO INFORM A FUTURE CLINICAL TRIAL, WE CONDUCTED A QUALITATIVE FORMATIVE INVESTIGATION, INFORMED BY THE SOCIAL CONTEXTUAL MODEL OF HEALTH BEHAVIOR CHANGE, TO IDENTIFY BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO YOGA THAT COULD IMPACT STUDY PARTICIPATION. WE RECRUITED TWENTY-FOUR RACIALLY/ETHNICALLY DIVERSE ADULTS, WITH AND WITHOUT PRIOR YOGA EXPERIENCE, FROM A LOW-INCOME, URBAN HOUSING COMMUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN EITHER AN INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEW OR FOCUS GROUP. A THEMATIC DATA ANALYSIS APPROACH WAS EMPLOYED. BARRIERS TO YOGA ENGAGEMENT INCLUDED THE PERCEPTION THAT YOGA LACKS PHYSICALITY AND WEIGHT LOSS BENEFITS, FEAR OF INJURY, LACK OF ABILITY/SELF-EFFICACY TO PERFORM THE PRACTICES, PREFERENCE FOR OTHER PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES, AND SCHEDULING DIFFICULTIES. FACILITATORS OF YOGA ENGAGEMENT INCLUDED A QUALITY YOGA INSTRUCTOR WHO PROVIDES INDIVIDUALIZED INSTRUCTION, BEGINNER LEVEL CLASSES, AND PROMOTIONAL MESSAGING THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA, SUCH AS STRESS REDUCTION.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
19 2247  34 THE INTEGRATION OF YOGA IN PHYSICAL THERAPY CLINICAL PRACTICE. HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ARE BEGINNING TO USE YOGA AS A TREATMENT MODALITY. HOWEVER, EVIDENCE EXPLAINING PHYSICAL THERAPISTS' INTEGRATION OF YOGA IN CLINICAL PRACTICE IS LACKING. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE HOW, WHY, AND WITH WHOM PHYSICAL THERAPISTS INTEGRATE YOGA INTO CLINICAL PRACTICE. DESIGN: THIS STUDY IS A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF QUALITATIVE DATA COLLECTED DURING A LARGER MULTI-METHODS STUDY. THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF 13 INTERVIEWS WAS CONDUCTED. RESULTS: ANALYSIS INDICATED FOUR THEMES, AND SIX SUBTHEMES. FACILITATING YOGA IN CLINICAL PRACTICE AND YOGA TRAINING THEMES; INCLUDING EVALUATION OF OUTCOMES, BILLING, TERMINOLOGY, AND SAFETY SUBTHEMES DESCRIBE HOW PHYSICAL THERAPISTS ARE USING YOGA IN CLINICAL PRACTICE. THE PERCEIVED CLIENT OUTCOMES THEME, INCLUDING PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES EXPLAIN WHY PHYSICAL THERAPISTS USE YOGA IN PRACTICE. THE YOGA WITH CLINICAL POPULATIONS THEME ADDRESSES WITH WHOM PHYSICAL THERAPISTS ARE USING YOGA. CONCLUSION: PHYSICAL THERAPISTS ARE USING YOGA WITH INDIVIDUALS WITH VARIOUS HEALTH CONDITIONS TO IMPROVE THEIR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. FINDINGS SUPPORT THE NEED FOR PHYSICAL THERAPISTS TO INCREASE THEIR ASSESSMENT AND DOCUMENTATION OF FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH CLIENT'S YOGA PARTICIPATION. DOCUMENTATION COULD CONTRIBUTE TO EVIDENCE-BASED LITERATURE RELATED TO HOW, WHY, AND WITH WHOM PHYSICAL THERAPISTS ARE USING YOGA. DOCUMENTED OUTCOMES COULD ALSO PROVIDE RATIONALE FOR YOGA TO RECEIVE CLASSIFICATION AS A REIMBURSABLE COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH APPROACH. FUTURE RESEARCH INVOLVING A LARGER, DIVERSE SAMPLE (E.G., PHYSICAL THERAPISTS WITH VARYING LEVELS OF EDUCATION AND YOGA TRAINING) FOCUSED ON HOW, WHY, AND WITH WHOM PHYSICAL THERAPISTS INTEGRATE YOGA INTO CLINICAL PRACTICE IS RECOMMENDED.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
20  129  40 A POPULATION-PRACTICE-BASED MODEL TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOGA IMPACTS ON HUMAN GLOBAL FUNCTIONING: A QUALITATIVE STUDY. INTRODUCTION:RESEARCH IS INCREASINGLY DEMONSTRATING A RANGE OF BENEFITS OF PRACTICING YOGA, SUCH AS IMPROVED PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH, SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS, AND SELF-CARE. MECHANISMS OF ACTION ARE LESS WELL UNDERSTOOD, BUT MAY INCLUDE BOTH PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT BENEFITS AND MECHANISMS OF YOGA PRACTICE, USING QUALITATIVE DATA COLLECTED FROM A LARGE-SCALE SURVEY OF YOGA USE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. METHODS: THE MIXED METHODS, CROSS-SECTIONAL ONLINE SURVEY COLLECTED DATA ON YOGA USE AND PERCEIVED BENEFITS FROM 2434 U.K. YOGA PRACTITIONERS. THE QUALITATIVE SURVEY ELEMENT USED OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS TO GAIN "REAL LIFE" DATA REGARDING PRACTICE AND PERCEIVED BENEFITS. DATA WERE ANALYZED THEMATICALLY AND DEDUCTIVELY. A PRACTICE-BASED MODEL DESCRIBING YOGA PRACTICE, MECHANISMS, AND BENEFITS, BASED ON THE KHALSA LOGIC MODEL OF YOGA, WAS DEVELOPED TO EXPLAIN THE DATA. FINDINGS: FINDINGS HIGHLIGHTED THAT A DIVERSE RANGE OF YOGA PRACTICES AND NONSPECIFIC CONTEXTUAL FACTORS RELATED TO PRACTICING YOGA, NEEDED TO BE CONSIDERED TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOGA WAS BENEFITTING PEOPLE. THESE PRACTICES ENCOMPASSED BOTH MODERN AND TRADITIONAL CONCEPTIONS OF YOGA AS A DEEPER LIFESTYLE PRACTICE. KEY MECHANISMS FOR CHANGE INCLUDED IMPROVEMENTS IN PHYSICAL STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY, STRESS REGULATION, RESILIENCE, EQUANIMITY, MIND-BODY AWARENESS, AND SPIRITUAL/PERSONAL GROWTH. THESE MECHANISMS RESULTED IN DIVERSE IMPROVEMENTS IN GLOBAL HEALTH FUNCTIONING, PARTICULARLY PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. CONCLUSIONS: THE KHALSA MODEL PROVIDED A USEFUL BASE UPON WHICH TO GUIDE THE NEW POPULATION-PRACTICE-BASED MODEL, TO UNDERSTAND PARTICIPANTS' "REAL LIFE" EXPERIENCES OF YOGA, HOW YOGA IS HELPING PEOPLE AND WHY. IT PROVIDES IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PRACTITIONERS, TEACHERS, AND THOSE DELIVERING YOGA INTERVENTIONS AS TO THE RANGE OF SKILLS AND POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE. IN ADDITION, FINDINGS INDICATE DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH, BY HIGHLIGHTING KEY YOGA MECHANISMS THAT RESEARCHERS MAY CHOOSE TO FOCUS ON IN FUTURE STUDIES.	2021

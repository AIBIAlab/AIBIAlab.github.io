1 1244 126 FEASIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING A COMPREHENSIVE YOGA PROGRAM AND ITS DOSE-EFFECT RELATIONSHIP ON CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS AND WELLNESS PARAMETERS: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: WE SOUGHT TO STUDY THE FEASIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING A COMPREHENSIVE, MOSTLY SELF-DIRECTED YOGA PROGRAM IN A HOSPITAL AND ITS DOSE-EFFECT RELATIONSHIP ON CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) MEASURES OVER SIX MONTHS. METHODS: YOGA-BASED TECHNIQUES (ADVANCED YOGA PRACTICES; AYP; ADVANCEDYOGAPRACTICES.COM) WERE TAUGHT IN 12 BIWEEKLY GROUP SESSIONS AND SELF-DIRECTED PRACTICE AT HOME WAS EMPHASIZED. CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS WERE ELUCIDATED BY INTERVIEW AND REVIEW OF MEDICAL HISTORY. QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) OUTCOMES INCLUDED THE SF-36, THE COHEN PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE (CPSS), AND THE HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE (HADS). RISK FACTORS AND QOL MEASURES WERE COMPARED IN PARTICIPANTS AT BASELINE AND SIX MONTHS, AS WELL AS BETWEEN THOSE PRACTICING >/= 7 TIMES VERSUS < 7 TIMES PER WEEK. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 22 INDIVIDUALS (19 WOMEN, MEAN AGE 59 +/- 8.7 YEARS) COMPLETED THE STUDY. AT SIX MONTHS, CHANGES WERE NOTED IN THE MENTAL COMPONENT SCALE (MCS) OF THE SF-36 (P=0.0004) AND THE CPSS (P = 0.022). A GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN CPSS WAS NOTED IN THOSE PRACTICING >/= 7 TIMES VERSUS < 7 TIMES A WEEK (P=0.045). NO CHANGES WERE NOTED IN CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS. CONCLUSIONS: THE PRESCRIPTION OF A SELF-DIRECTED YOGA PROGRAM WAS FEASIBLE IN A HOSPITAL SETTING AND RESULTED IN IMPROVEMENT IN QOL MEASURES AT SIX MONTHS. PRACTICING MORE THAN SEVEN TIMES PER WEEK CORRELATED WITH GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN THE PERCEPTION OF STRESS. THUS, AT LEAST A ONCE-DAILY DOSE OF AYP TECHNIQUES FOR A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PERCEIVED STRESS IS AN APPROPRIATE DOSE TO EMPLOY AND STUDY IN HOSPITAL SETTINGS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
2  116  35 A PILOT STUDY OF A YOGA MEDITATION PROTOCOL FOR PATIENTS WITH MEDICALLY REFRACTORY EPILEPSY. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF A YOGA MEDITATION PROTOCOL (YMP) AS AN ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH DRUG-RESISTANT CHRONIC EPILEPSY. DESIGN: THE DESIGN WAS A PROSPECTIVE, NONRANDOMIZED, OPEN-LABEL, ADD-ON TRIAL WITH A 12-WEEK BASELINE PERIOD, FOLLOWED BY A 12-WEEK SUPERVISED YMP ADMINISTRATION PHASE. THE FREQUENCY OF COMPLEX PARTIAL SEIZURES (CPS) WAS ASSESSED AT 3, 6, AND 12 MONTHS OF THE TREATMENT PERIOD. SETTING: THE SETTING WAS A COMPREHENSIVE EPILEPSY CARE CENTER ATTACHED TO A TERTIARY REFERRAL MEDICAL INSTITUTION SITUATED ON THE SOUTHWEST COAST OF THE INDIAN PENINSULA. SUBJECTS: THE SUBJECTS WERE 20 PATIENTS (14 MALES AND 6 FEMALES, AGE RANGE 15 TO 47 YEARS, MEDIAN 27 YEARS) WITH UNEQUIVOCALLY ESTABLISHED DIAGNOSES OF EPILEPSY WITH AT LEAST 4 CPS (WITH OR WITHOUT SECONDARY GENERALIZATION) DURING THE PRECEDING 3 MONTHS. INTERVENTION: INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF A YMP 20 MINUTES TWICE DAILY (MORNINGS AND EVENINGS) AT HOME, AND SUPERVISED SESSIONS OF A YMP EVERY WEEK FOR 3 MONTHS. CONTINUATION OF THE YMP BEYOND 3 MONTHS WAS OPTIONAL. OUTCOME MEASURE: THE OUTCOME MEASURE WAS THE SEIZURE FREQUENCY AT 3, 6, AND 12 MONTHS OF THE TREATMENT PERIOD. THE SUBJECTS WITH > OR = 50% REDUCTION IN MONTHLY SEIZURE RATE FROM BASELINE WERE CLASSIFIED AS RESPONDERS, AND SUBJECTS WITH <50% SEIZURE REDUCTION AS NONRESPONDERS. RESULTS: AT 3 MONTHS, A REDUCTION IN SEIZURE FREQUENCY WAS NOTED IN ALL EXCEPT 1 PATIENT, SIX OF WHOM HAD > OR = 50% SEIZURE REDUCTION. OF 16 PATIENTS WHO CONTINUED THE YMP BEYOND 3 MONTHS, 14 PATIENTS RESPONDED AT 6 MONTHS; 6 OF THEM WERE SEIZURE-FREE FOR 3 MONTHS. ALL EIGHT PATIENTS WHO CONTINUED THE YMP BEYOND 6 MONTHS RESPONDED; THREE OF THEM WERE SEIZURE FREE FOR 6 MONTHS. CONCLUSIONS: IF CONFIRMED THROUGH RANDOMIZED TRIALS INVOLVING A LARGER NUMBER OF PATIENTS, THIS YMP MAY BECOME A COST-EFFECTIVE AND ADVERSE EFFECT-FREE ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH DRUG-RESISTANT EPILEPSIES.	2006	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
3 1063  33 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY AND MOOD IN WOMEN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF AN 8-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY AND MOOD IN GENERALLY HEALTHY WOMEN. DESIGN: RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. PARTICIPANTS: FIFTY-TWO HEALTHY WOMEN WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A YOGA GROUP OR A CONTROL GROUP. INTERVENTIONS: PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP COMPLETED AN 8-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM, WHICH COMPRISED A 60-MINUTE SESSION TWICE A WEEK. EACH SESSION CONSISTED OF BREATHING EXERCISES, YOGA POSE PRACTICE, AND SUPINE MEDITATION/RELAXATION. THE CONTROL GROUP WAS INSTRUCTED NOT TO ENGAGE IN ANY YOGA PRACTICE AND TO MAINTAIN THEIR USUAL LEVEL OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY DURING THE STUDY. OUTCOME MEASURES: PARTICIPANTS' HEART RATE VARIABILITY, PERCEIVED STRESS, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, AND STATE AND TRAIT ANXIETY WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE (WEEK 0) AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION (WEEK 9). RESULTS: NO MEASURES OF HEART RATE VARIABILITY CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY IN EITHER THE YOGA OR CONTROL GROUP AFTER INTERVENTION. STATE ANXIETY WAS REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE YOGA GROUP BUT NOT IN THE CONTROL GROUP. NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE NOTED IN PERCEIVED STRESS, DEPRESSION, OR TRAIT ANXIETY IN EITHER GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: AN 8-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO IMPROVE HEART RATE VARIABILITY. HOWEVER, SUCH A PROGRAM APPEARS TO BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING STATE ANXIETY IN GENERALLY HEALTHY WOMEN. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD INVOLVE LONGER PERIODS OF YOGA TRAINING, INCLUDE HEART RATE VARIABILITY MEASURES BOTH AT REST AND DURING YOGA PRACTICE, AND ENROLL WOMEN WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF STRESS AND TRAIT ANXIETY.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
4 2344  37 USING A STANDARDIZED VINIYOGA PROTOCOL FOR LUNG CANCER SURVIVORS: A PILOT STUDY EXAMINING EFFECTS ON BREATHING EASE. ALTHOUGH LUNG CANCER IS PERCEIVED AS A DIRE DIAGNOSIS, INCREASES IN THE 5-YEAR SURVIVAL RATE OF INDIVIDUALS WITH NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER (NSCLC) HAVE BEEN REPORTED. SURVIVORS, HOWEVER, CONTINUE TO BE EXCESSIVELY BURDENED WITH SYMPTOMS SUCH AS RESPIRATORY DISTRESS WHICH INTERFERE WITH FUNCTIONING AND QUALITY OF LIFE. WHILE EXERCISE AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ARE STRONGLY RECOMMENDED, NSCLC SURVIVORS MAY BE RELUCTANT TO PARTICIPATE DUE TO ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED SHORTNESS OF BREATH EXACERBATED WITH MOVEMENT.THIS QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL, INTERVENTION-ONLY PILOT STUDY AIMED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF AN 8-WEEK STANDARDIZED YOGA PROTOCOL FOR STAGE I-IIIA NSCLC SURVIVORS (N=9). THE PROTOCOL WAS DEVELOPED WITHIN THE VINIYOGA (HATHA) TRADITION WITH RESPIRATORY EXPERTS. BREATHING EASE, DYSPNEA, OXYGEN SATURATION, AND RESPIRATORY FUNCTION WERE EXPLORED IN RELATIONSHIP TO YOGA PRACTICE (45-MINUTE SESSIONS ONCE PER WEEK AND HOME PRACTICE) USING REPEATED-MEASURES ANALYSIS. NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS REPORTING DYSPNEA RANGED FROM 25 TO 50% PRIOR TO PRACTICE WITH NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASE DURING SESSIONS, AND MODERATE DECREASES NOTED AT TIMES. OXYGEN SATURATION REMAINED HIGH AND VITAL SIGNS STABLE; FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1 SECOND (FEV1) VALUES INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE 14-WEEK STUDY PERIOD (P<0.0001). YOGA, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON POSTURES COORDINATED WITH BREATHING AND MEDITATION PRACTICES, OFFERS A POTENTIALLY FEASIBLE AND BENEFICIAL OPTION THAT REQUIRES FURTHER STUDY IN THIS POPULATION.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
5    9  36 "I'M MORE IN BALANCE": A QUALITATIVE STUDY OF YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC NECK PAIN. OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE PERCEIVED INFLUENCE OF YOGA ON BODY PERCEPTION AND PSYCHOSOCIAL ASPECTS OF LIFE FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC NECK PAIN. DESIGN: THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED USING SEMISTANDARDIZED INTERVIEWS. SETTING: THE INTERVENTIONS AND INTERVIEWS TOOK PLACE IN A REFERRAL CENTER'S RESEARCH DEPARTMENT. SUBJECTS: EIGHTEEN (18) PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC NONSPECIFIC NECK PAIN WERE RECRUITED FROM A LARGER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA FOR CHRONIC NECK PAIN. INTERVENTIONS: PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED 90 MINUTES OF IYENGAR YOGA ONCE A WEEK FOR 9 WEEKS. OUTCOME MEASURES: PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED A DRAWING OF THEIR NECK AND SHOULDER REGIONS TO REFLECT THEIR SUBJECTIVE BODY PERCEPTIONS BEFORE AND AFTER THEIR YOGA PROGRAM. SEMISTANDARDIZED INTERVIEWS WERE USED TO EXPLORE THEIR BODY PERCEPTION, EMOTIONAL STATUS, EVERYDAY LIFE AND COPING SKILLS, AS WELL AS ANY PERCEIVED CHANGES IN THESE DIMENSIONS POSTPARTICIPATION. AN INTERDISCIPLINARY GROUP ANALYZED THE STUDY DATA USING CONTENT ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS REPORTED CHANGE ON FIVE DIMENSIONS OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE: PHYSICAL, COGNITIVE, EMOTIONAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND SOCIAL. PHYSICALLY, MOST PARTICIPANTS CITED RENEWED BODY AWARENESS, BOTH DURING THEIR YOGA PRACTICE AND IN THEIR DAILY LIVES. SUCH CHANGE WAS ECHOED IN THEIR POSTPARTICIPATION BODY DRAWINGS. COGNITIVELY, PARTICIPANTS REPORTED INCREASED PERCEIVED CONTROL OVER THEIR HEALTH. EMOTIONALLY, THEY NOTED GREATER ACCEPTANCE OF THEIR PAIN AND LIFE BURDENS. BEHAVIORALLY, THEY DESCRIBED ENHANCED USE OF ACTIVE COPING STRATEGIES. FINALLY, SOCIALLY, THEY REPORTED RENEWED PARTICIPATION IN AN ACTIVE LIFE. CONCLUSIONS: PARTICIPANTS LINKED YOGA TO CHANGE ON ALL DIMENSIONS OF HUMAN EXPERIENCE, ATTRIBUTING REDUCED PAIN LEVELS, INCREASED COPING ABILITY, BETTER PAIN ACCEPTANCE AND INCREASED CONTROL TO IT. BODY AWARENESS APPEARED A KEY MECHANISM IN THESE CHANGES.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
6 2157  31 THE EFFECTS OF UPPER LIMB EXERCISE THROUGH YOGA ON LIMB SWELLING IN CHINESE BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS - A PILOT STUDY. PURPOSE: BREAST CANCER IS THE MOST COMMON FEMALE CANCER. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON LYMPHEDEMA IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. DESIGN: REPEATED MEASURES BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION. WE ENROLLED 15 WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER WHO HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY WORN ELASTIC CLOTHING TO TREAT LYMPHEDEMA. METHODS: THE PROGRAM WAS LED BY A CERTIFIED TRAINER AND CONSISTED OF 60-MINUTE SESSIONS, THREE TIMES A WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS. THE VOLUMES OF THE AFFECTED AND NORMAL LIMBS WERE MEASURED. A SELF-ASSESSED EDEMA SCORE WAS ALSO RECORDED. FINDINGS: FIFTEEN PATIENTS COMPLETED THE PROGRAM, NONE OF WHOM SUFFERED FROM COMPLICATIONS RELATED TO EXERCISE. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT EDEMA AFTER EXERCISE. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE NOTED IN SUBGROUP ANALYSIS BY AGE OR THE AFFECTED ARM. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA DOES NOT INDUCE LYMPHEDEMA. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: LYMPHEDEMA IS USUALLY TREATED WITH UNCOMFORTABLE ELASTIC CLOTHING, AND HIGH-RESISTANCE EXERCISE MAY INDUCE EDEMA. YOGA MAY BE SUITABLE FOR THESE PATIENTS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
7 1192  38 EXAMINING A THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS. BACKGROUND: IN THE EARLIER STAGES OF PROSTATE CANCER, EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS HAVE CREATED A NEED FOR RESEARCH TO FOCUS ON PRACTICES THAT MAY IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE THROUGHOUT SURVIVORSHIP. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS A SIGNIFICANT SUPPORTIVE CARE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS, THOUGH THE OPTIMAL MODALITY IS NOT YET UNDERSTOOD. HYPOTHESES: THE AUTHORS HYPOTHESIZED THAT YOGA WOULD BE A FEASIBLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OPTION FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS AND THEIR SUPPORT PERSONS AND THAT THE INCORPORATION OF SOCIAL SUPPORT WOULD INCREASE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ADHERENCE. METHODS: THIS 14-WEEK FEASIBILITY STUDY INVOLVED A 7-WEEK CLASS-BASED YOGA PROGRAM (ADHERENCE PHASE), FOLLOWED BY 7 WEEKS OF SELF-SELECTED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (MAINTENANCE PHASE). DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEHAVIOR, QUALITY OF LIFE, FATIGUE, STRESS, MOOD, AND FITNESS VARIABLES WERE ASSESSED AT 3 TIME POINTS. PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS' PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT WAS RATED DURING YOGA AND AFTER YOGA. RESULTS: CLASS ATTENDANCE WAS 6.1 AND 5.8 FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS (N = 15) AND THEIR SUPPORT PERSONS (N = 10), RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE 7 CLASSES. LEVELS OF PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT WERE HIGHER FOR THOSE WHO BROUGHT A SUPPORT PERSON. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WITH REGARD TO STRESS, FATIGUE, AND MOOD BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA CLASS (ALL PS < .05) WERE REPORTED BY ALL PARTICIPANTS. NO CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE NOTED ON PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVOR'S QUALITY OF LIFE OR FATIGUE OVER THE COURSE OF THE 14-WEEK STUDY. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA IS A FEASIBLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OPTION FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS. THE PROGRAM HAD A PROMISING UPTAKE RATE, HIGH PROGRAM ADHERENCE RATE, AND THERE WERE ACUTE PROGRAM BENEFITS WITH REGARD TO STRESS, FATIGUE, AND MOOD FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS. FUTURE EXAMINATION IS WARRANTED WITH REGARD TO CHRONIC BENEFITS AND GROUP COHESION INFLUENCES ON LEVELS OF PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
8 2783  30 YOGA THERAPY AS AN ADJUNCT TO CONVENTIONAL MANAGEMENT OF SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS: A CASE SERIES. SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS (SSC) IS AN AUTOIMMUNE DISORDER LEADING TO SIGNIFICANT DISABILITY AND LOSS OF QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). YOGA HAS BECOME POPULAR IN RECENT TIMES FOR ITS POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS. SINCE THERE ARE NO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS ON THE USE OF YOGA FOR SSC, WE PRESENT TWO FEMALE CASES (AGED 49 AND 29 RESPECTIVELY) OF LIMITED SSC (DURATION OF ILLNESS 4 AND 3 YEARS RESPECTIVELY) WHO UNDERWENT YOGA THERAPY AS AN ADJUNCT TO CONVENTIONAL MANAGEMENT IN A RESIDENTIAL SETTING FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE AND FOUR WEEKS, RESPECTIVELY. DURING THEIR STAY, THEY UNDERWENT A SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED YOGA MODULE. AFTER THEIR DISCHARGE, THEY WERE FOLLOWED-UP FOR FOUR WEEKS, DURING WHICH THEY WERE ASKED TO CONTINUE PRACTICING YOGA FOR 1 H EVERY DAY. BOTH OF THEM REPORTED A REDUCTION IN PAIN, STIFFNESS, SYMPTOM SCORES, AND IMPROVED QOL ON DISCHARGE AND AT THE FOLLOW-UP COMPARED TO THE VALUES ON ADMISSION. ERYTHROCYTE SEDIMENTATION RATE (ESR) AND C-REACTIVE PROTEIN (CRP), AS BIOMARKERS OF INFLAMMATION, REDUCED ON THE DISCHARGE WHEN COMPARED TO THE BASELINE. NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE NOTED DURING THE STAY AND THE FOLLOW-UP. THUS, THE PRESENT CASE SERIES INDICATE A POSSIBLE BENEFICIAL ROLE OF YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT THERAPY TO CONVENTIONAL MANAGEMENT OF SSC. FURTHER STUDIES IN THE AREA ARE WARRANTED TO ASCERTAIN THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR SSC.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
9  680  33 EFFECT OF A YOGA PROGRAMME ON AN INDIVIDUAL WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE: A SINGLE-SUBJECT DESIGN. PURPOSE: TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF EIGHT WEEKLY YOGA SESSIONS ON BALANCE, MOBILITY AND REPORTED QUALITY OF LIFE OF AN INDIVIDUAL WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD). FURTHERMORE, TO TEST THE METHODOLOGY IN ORDER TO INFORM FUTURE RESEARCH. METHOD: A 69-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH AN 8-YEAR HISTORY OF PD (HOEHN AND YAHR RATING TWO) WAS SELECTED FOR THE STUDY, WHICH HAD A SINGLE SUBJECT ABA DESIGN. A 1-WEEK BASELINE WAS FOLLOWED BY AN 8-WEEK PERIOD OF WEEKLY 60 MIN YOGA CLASSES AND A FURTHER 5 WEEKS OF TREATMENT WITHDRAWAL. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES USED WERE BERG BALANCE SCALE (BBS), TIMED UP AND GO (TUG) AND THE PARKINSON'S DISEASE QUESTIONNAIRE-39 (PDQ-39); COLLECTED AT BASELINE, BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION AND AT FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: AN IMPROVEMENT WAS NOTED IN THE BBS AND TUG DURING THE INTERVENTION PHASE; ALTHOUGH THESE CHANGES DID NOT APPEAR TO BE CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT. NO CHANGE IN QUALITY OF LIFE AS MEASURED BY THE PDQ-39 WAS NOTED. CONCLUSIONS: THE OBJECTIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITIES DURING THE INTERVENTION PERIOD WERE NOT CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT. SUBJECTIVELY, THE PARTICIPANT GAINED MUCH ENJOYMENT AND RELAXATION FROM THE YOGA CLASSES. THIS STUDY JUSTIFIES THE NEED FOR FURTHER STUDIES USING A LARGER SAMPLE SIZE. ADDITIONALLY, IT WILL INFORM THE METHODOLOGICAL DESIGN.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
10  260  38 ACCEPTANCE AND COMMITMENT THERAPY AND YOGA FOR DRUG-REFRACTORY EPILEPSY: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: THERE IS A NEED FOR CONTROLLED OUTCOME STUDIES ON BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT OF EPILEPSY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE ACCEPTANCE AND COMMITMENT THERAPY (ACT) AND YOGA IN THE TREATMENT OF EPILEPSY. METHODS: THE DESIGN CONSISTED OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH REPEATED MEASURES (N=18). ALL PARTICIPANTS HAD AN EEG-VERIFIED EPILEPSY DIAGNOSIS WITH DRUG-REFRACTORY SEIZURES. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO ONE OF TWO GROUPS: ACT OR YOGA. THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS WERE MEASURED USING SEIZURE INDEX (FREQUENCY X DURATION) AND QUALITY OF LIFE (SATISFACTION WITH LIFE SCALE, WHOQOL-BREF). THE TREATMENT PROTOCOLS CONSISTED OF 12 HOURS OF PROFESSIONAL THERAPY DISTRIBUTED IN TWO INDIVIDUAL SESSIONS, TWO GROUP SESSIONS DURING A 5-WEEK PERIOD, AND BOOSTER SESSIONS AT 6 AND 12 MONTHS POSTTREATMENT. SEIZURE INDEX WAS CONTINUOUSLY ASSESSED DURING THE 3-MONTH BASELINE AND 12-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. QUALITY OF LIFE WAS MEASURED AFTER TREATMENT AND AT THE 6-MONTH AND 1-YEAR FOLLOW-UPS. RESULTS: THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT BOTH ACT AND YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE SEIZURE INDEX AND INCREASE QUALITY OF LIFE OVER TIME. ACT REDUCED SEIZURE INDEX SIGNIFICANTLY MORE AS COMPARED WITH YOGA. PARTICIPANTS IN BOTH THE ACT AND YOGA GROUPS IMPROVED THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE SIGNIFICANTLY AS MEASURED BY ONE OF TWO QUALITY-OF-LIFE INSTRUMENTS. THE ACT GROUP INCREASED THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE SIGNIFICANTLY AS COMPARED WITH THE YOGA GROUP AS MEASURED BY THE WHOQOL-BREF, AND THE YOGA GROUP INCREASED THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE SIGNIFICANTLY AS COMPARED WITH THE ACT GROUP AS MEASURED BY THE SWLS. CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENTS, SUCH AS ACT AND YOGA, DECREASE SEIZURE INDEX AND INCREASE QUALITY OF LIFE.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
11 2864  40 YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION FOR CAREGIVERS OF OUTPATIENTS WITH PSYCHOSIS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: THE USE OF YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR CAREGIVERS OF PATIENTS WITH PSYCHOSIS HAS BEEN POORLY STUDIED. THE CURRENT STUDY AIMED TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF A BRIEF YOGA PROGRAM AS AN INTERVENTION IN CAREGIVERS OF OUTPATIENTS WITH FUNCTIONAL PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS USING A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED RESEARCH DESIGN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CAREGIVERS WHO AGREED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY (N=29) WERE RANDOMIZED INTO YOGA (N=15) OR WAIT-LIST GROUP (N=14). THEY WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND AT THE END OF 3 MONTHS. PATIENTS WHO WERE RANDOMIZED INTO THE YOGA GROUP WERE OFFERED SUPERVISED YOGA TRAINING THRICE A WEEK FOR 4 WEEKS, AFTER WHICH THEY WERE INSTRUCTED TO PRACTICE AT HOME FOR THE NEXT 2 MONTHS. DUE TO THE SMALL SAMPLE SIZE AND SOME VARIABLES NOT BEING NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED, NON-PARAMETRIC STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS USED. RESULTS: RESULTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BURDEN SCORES AND IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE SCORES IN THE YOGA GROUP AS COMPARED TO THE WAIT-LIST GROUP AT THE END OF 3 MONTHS. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCORES IN CAREGIVERS, OR PSYCHOPATHOLOGY SCORES IN PATIENTS. CONCLUSION: IN CAREGIVERS OF OUTPATIENTS WITH FUNCTIONAL PSYCHOSIS, 4 WEEKS OF TRAINING FOLLOWED BY 3 MONTHS OF HOME PRACTICE OF A YOGA MODULE OFFERED SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE OVER WAITLIST. YOGA CAN BE OFFERED AS AN INTERVENTION FOR CAREGIVERS OF PATIENTS WITH SEVERE MENTAL DISORDERS. METHODS OF PROVIDING YOGA INTERVENTION CLOSER TO THE COMMUNITY OR USE OF FLEXIBLE MODULES AT HOSPITALS NEEDS FURTHER STUDY.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
12 1859  45 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT TRIAL OF YOGA IN OVERWEIGHT AND OBESE BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS: EFFECTS ON QUALITY OF LIFE AND ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASURES. PURPOSE: TO OBTAIN ESTIMATES OF TIME TO RECRUIT THE STUDY SAMPLE, RETENTION, FACILITY-BASED CLASS ATTENDANCE AND HOME PRACTICE FOR A STUDY OF YOGA IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS, AND ITS EFFICACY ON FATIGUE, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), AND WEIGHT CHANGE. METHODS: SIXTY-THREE POST-TREATMENT STAGES 0-III BORDERLINE OVERWEIGHT AND OBESE (BODY MASS INDEX >/= 24 KG/M(2)) BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A 6-MONTH, FACILITY- AND HOME-BASED VINIYOGA INTERVENTION (N = 32) OR A WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 31). THE YOGA GOAL WAS FIVE PRACTICES PER WEEK. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES WERE CHANGES IN QOL, FATIGUE, AND WEIGHT FROM BASELINE TO 6 MONTHS. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED CHANGES IN WAIST AND HIP CIRCUMFERENCE. RESULTS: IT TOOK 12 MONTHS TO COMPLETE RECRUITMENT. PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED A MEAN OF 19.6 CLASSES AND PRACTICED AT HOME A MEAN OF 55.8 TIMES DURING THE 6-MONTH PERIOD. AT FOLLOW-UP, 90% OF PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES AND 87% COMPLETED ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS. QOL AND FATIGUE IMPROVED TO A GREATER EXTENT AMONG WOMEN IN THE YOGA GROUP RELATIVE TO WOMEN IN THE CONTROL GROUP, ALTHOUGH NO DIFFERENCES WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE DECREASED 3.1 CM (95% CI, -5.7 AND -0.4) MORE AMONG WOMEN IN THE YOGA COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP, WITH NO DIFFERENCE IN WEIGHT CHANGE. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY PROVIDES IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING RECRUITMENT, RETENTION, AND PRACTICE LEVELS ACHIEVED DURING A 6-MONTH, INTENSIVE YOGA INTERVENTION IN OVERWEIGHT AND OBESE BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. YOGA MAY HELP DECREASE WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE; FUTURE STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE RESULTS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
13 1076  32 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PHYSIOLOGICAL INDICES, ANXIETY AND SOCIAL FUNCTIONING IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PATIENTS: A RANDOMIZED TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) AS A CHRONIC DISEASE COULD AFFECT PATIENTS' VARIOUS DOMAINS OF LIFE. AIM: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL INDICES, ANXIETY AND SOCIAL FUNCTIONING OF PATIENTS WITH MS IN SOUTHWEST, IRAN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IN THIS CLINICAL TRIAL STUDY, 60 MS PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED ACCORDING TO INCLUSION CRITERIA AND RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO TWO GROUPS OF 30 EACH. PRIOR TO AND AFTER INTERVENTION, THE PATIENTS' VITAL SIGNS WERE MEASURED. FOR CASE GROUP YOGA EXERCISES WERE PERFORMED THREE SESSIONS A WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS WHILE CONTROL GROUP PERFORMED NO EXERCISE. THE DATA WERE GATHERED BY QUESTIONNAIRE AND ANALYSED BY DESCRIPTIVE AND ANALYTICAL STATISTICS IN SPSS. RESULTS: PRIOR TO INTERVENTION, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN FATIGUE SEVERITY AND PAIN BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS BUT THE MEAN FATIGUE SEVERITY AND PAIN IN CASE GROUP DECREASED COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP AFTER THE INTERVENTION. PRIOR TO INTERVENTION, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN MEAN PHYSIOLOGICAL INDICES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS BUT THE MEAN PHYSIOLOGICAL INDICES IN CASE GROUP DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER THE INTERVENTION (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: YOGA IS LIKELY TO INCREASE SELF-EFFICACY OF MS PATIENTS THROUGH ENHANCING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, INCREASING THE STRENGTH OF LOWER LIMBS AND BALANCE, AND DECREASING FATIGUE AND PAIN, AND FINALLY TO PROMOTE SOCIAL FUNCTIONING AND TO RELIEVE STRESS AND ANXIETY IN THESE PATIENTS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
14 2628  35 YOGA FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF PAIN AND SLEEP IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS: A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF A RELAXATION-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, DESIGNED AND REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH DELPHI RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED FROM A HOSPITAL DATABASE, AND RANDOMIZED TO EITHER EIGHT WEEKLY 75-MIN YOGA CLASSES OR A USUAL CARE CONTROL. FEASIBILITY WAS DETERMINED BY RECRUITMENT RATES, RETENTION, PROTOCOL ADHERENCE, PARTICIPANT SATISFACTION AND ADVERSE EVENTS. SECONDARY PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED USING SELF-REPORTED QUESTIONNAIRES AT BASELINE (WEEK 0), WEEK 9 (PRIMARY TIME POINT) AND WEEK 12 (FOLLOW-UP). RESULTS: OVER A 3-MONTH PERIOD, 26 PARTICIPANTS WITH MILD PAIN, MILD TO MODERATE FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY AND MODERATE DISEASE ACTIVITY WERE RECRUITED INTO THE STUDY (25% RECRUITMENT RATE). RETENTION RATES WERE 100% FOR YOGA PARTICIPANTS AND 92% FOR USUAL CARE PARTICIPANTS AT BOTH WEEKS 9 AND 12. PROTOCOL ADHERENCE AND PARTICIPANT SATISFACTION WERE HIGH. YOGA PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED A MEDIAN OF SEVEN CLASSES; ADDITIONALLY, SEVEN OF THE YOGA PARTICIPANTS (54%) REPORTED CONTINUING YOGA AT HOME DURING THE FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS WERE RELATED TO THE STUDY. SECONDARY OUTCOMES SHOWED NO GROUP EFFECTS OF YOGA COMPARED WITH USUAL CARE. CONCLUSIONS: A RELAXATION-BASED YOGA PROGRAMME WAS FOUND TO BE FEASIBLE AND SAFE FOR PARTICIPANTS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS-RELATED PAIN AND FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY. ADVERSE EVENTS WERE MINOR, AND NOT UNEXPECTED FROM AN INTERVENTION INCLUDING PHYSICAL COMPONENTS. THIS PILOT PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR LARGER INTERVENTION STUDIES, AND SUPPORTS FURTHER EXPLORATION OF YOGA AS A COMPLEX INTERVENTION TO ASSIST WITH THE MANAGEMENT OF RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
15 2222  39 THE IMPACT OF MODIFIED HATHA YOGA ON CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: A PILOT STUDY. PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS RANDOMIZED PILOT STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE A POSSIBLE DESIGN FOR A 6-WEEK MODIFIED HATHA YOGA PROTOCOL TO STUDY THE EFFECTS ON PARTICIPANTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. PARTICIPANTS: TWENTY-TWO PARTICIPANTS (M = 4; F = 17), BETWEEN THE AGES OF 30 AND 65, WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) WERE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER AN IMMEDIATE YOGA BASED INTERVENTION, OR TO A CONTROL GROUP WITH NO TREATMENT DURING THE OBSERVATION PERIOD BUT RECEIVED LATER YOGA TRAINING. METHODS: A SPECIFIC CLBP YOGA PROTOCOL DESIGNED AND MODIFIED FOR THIS POPULATION BY A CERTIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTOR WAS ADMINISTERED FOR ONE HOUR, TWICE A WEEK FOR 6 WEEKS. PRIMARY FUNCTIONAL OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED THE FORWARD REACH (FR) AND SIT AND REACH (SR) TESTS. ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED OSWESTRY DISABILITY INDEX (ODI) AND BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY (BDI) QUESTIONNAIRES. GUIDING QUESTIONS WERE USED FOR QUALITATIVE DATA ANALYSIS TO ASCERTAIN HOW YOGA PARTICIPANTS PERCEIVED THE INSTRUCTOR, GROUP DYNAMICS, AND THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON THEIR LIFE. ANALYSIS: TO ACCOUNT FOR DROP OUTS, THE DATA WERE DIVIDED INTO BETTER OR NOT CATEGORIES, AND ANALYZED USING CHI-SQUARE TO EXAMINE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GROUPS. QUALITATIVE DATA WERE ANALYZED THROUGH FREQUENCY OF POSITIVE RESPONSES. RESULTS: POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT TRENDS IN THE FUNCTIONAL MEASUREMENT SCORES SHOWED IMPROVED BALANCE AND FLEXIBILITY AND DECREASED DISABILITY AND DEPRESSION FOR THE YOGA GROUP BUT THIS PILOT WAS NOT POWERED TO REACH STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS INCLUDED A HIGH DROPOUT RATE IN THE CONTROL GROUP AND LARGE BASELINE DIFFERENCES IN THE SECONDARY MEASURES. IN ADDITION, ANALYSIS OF THE QUALITATIVE DATA REVEALED THE FOLLOWING FREQUENCY OF RESPONSES (1) GROUP INTERVENTION MOTIVATED THE PARTICIPANTS AND (2) YOGA FOSTERED RELAXATION AND NEW AWARENESS/LEARNING. CONCLUSION: A MODIFIED YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION MAY BENEFIT INDIVIDUALS WITH CLB, BUT A LARGER STUDY IS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE DEFINITIVE EVIDENCE. ALSO, THE IMPACT ON DEPRESSION AND DISABILITY COULD BE CONSIDERED AS IMPORTANT OUTCOMES FOR FURTHER STUDY. ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONAL OUTCOME MEASURES SHOULD BE EXPLORED. THIS PILOT STUDY SUPPORTS THE NEED FOR MORE RESEARCH INVESTIGATING THE EFFECT OF YOGA FOR THIS POPULATION.	2004	
                                                                                                                    
16  687  50 EFFECT OF AN OFFICE WORKSITE-BASED YOGA PROGRAM ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY: OUTCOMES OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC WORK-RELATED STRESS IS AN INDEPENDENT RISK FACTOR FOR CARDIOMETABOLIC DISEASES AND ASSOCIATED MORTALITY, PARTICULARLY WHEN COMPOUNDED BY A SEDENTARY WORK ENVIRONMENT. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE IF AN OFFICE WORKSITE-BASED HATHA YOGA PROGRAM COULD IMPROVE PHYSIOLOGICAL STRESS, EVALUATED VIA HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV), AND ASSOCIATED HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOMES IN A COHORT OF OFFICE WORKERS. METHODS: THIRTY-SEVEN ADULTS EMPLOYED IN UNIVERSITY-BASED OFFICE POSITIONS WERE RANDOMIZED UPON THE COMPLETION OF BASELINE TESTING TO AN EXPERIMENTAL OR CONTROL GROUP. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP COMPLETED A 10-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM PRESCRIBED THREE SESSIONS PER WEEK DURING LUNCH HOUR (50 MIN PER SESSION). AN EXPERIENCED INSTRUCTOR LED THE SESSIONS, WHICH EMPHASIZED ASANAS (POSTURES) AND VINYASA (EXERCISES). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS THE HIGH FREQUENCY (HF) POWER COMPONENT OF HRV. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED ADDITIONAL HRV PARAMETERS, MUSCULOSKELETAL FITNESS (I.E. PUSH-UP, SIDE-BRIDGE, AND SIT & REACH TESTS) AND PSYCHOLOGICAL INDICES (I.E. STATE AND TRAIT ANXIETY, QUALITY OF LIFE AND JOB SATISFACTION). RESULTS: ALL MEASURES OF HRV FAILED TO CHANGE IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP VERSUS THE CONTROL GROUP, EXCEPT THAT THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED LF:HF (P = 0.04) AND REDUCED PNN50 (P = 0.04) VERSUS CONTROL, CONTRARY TO OUR HYPOTHESES. FLEXIBILITY, EVALUATED VIA SIT & REACH TEST INCREASED IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP VERSUS THE CONTROL GROUP (P < 0.001). NO OTHER ADAPTATIONS WERE NOTED. POST HOC ANALYSIS COMPARING PARTICIPANTS WHO COMPLETED >/=70% OF YOGA SESSIONS (N = 11) TO CONTROL (N = 19) YIELDED THE SAME FINDINGS, EXCEPT THAT THE HIGH ADHERERS ALSO REDUCED STATE ANXIETY (P = 0.02) AND RMSSD (P = 0.05), AND TENDED TO IMPROVE THE PUSH-UP TEST (P = 0.07) VERSUS CONTROL. CONCLUSIONS: A 10-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION DELIVERED AT THE OFFICE WORKSITE DURING LUNCH HOUR DID NOT IMPROVE HF POWER OR OTHER HRV PARAMETERS. HOWEVER, IMPROVEMENTS IN FLEXIBILITY, STATE ANXIETY AND MUSCULOSKELETAL FITNESS WERE NOTED WITH HIGH ADHERENCE. FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS SHOULD INCORPORATE STRATEGIES TO PROMOTE ADHERENCE, INVOLVE MORE FREQUENT AND LONGER DURATIONS OF YOGA TRAINING, AND ENROL COHORTS WHO SUFFER FROM HIGHER LEVELS OF WORK-RELATED STRESS.

17 1863  33 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA AND EXERCISE IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA AND OF AEROBIC EXERCISE ON COGNITIVE FUNCTION, FATIGUE, MOOD, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS). METHODS: SUBJECTS WITH CLINICALLY DEFINITE MS AND EXPANDED DISABILITY STATUS SCORE LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 6.0 WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THREE GROUPS LASTING 6 MONTHS: WEEKLY IYENGAR YOGA CLASS ALONG WITH HOME PRACTICE, WEEKLY EXERCISE CLASS USING A STATIONARY BICYCLE ALONG WITH HOME EXERCISE, OR A WAITING-LIST CONTROL GROUP. OUTCOME ASSESSMENTS PERFORMED AT BASELINE AND AT THE END OF THE 6-MONTH PERIOD INCLUDED A BATTERY OF COGNITIVE MEASURES FOCUSED ON ATTENTION, PHYSIOLOGIC MEASURES OF ALERTNESS, PROFILE OF MOOD STATES, STATE-TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY, MULTI-DIMENSIONAL FATIGUE INVENTORY (MFI), AND SHORT FORM (SF)-36 HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE. RESULTS: SIXTY-NINE SUBJECTS WERE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED. TWELVE SUBJECTS DID NOT FINISH THE 6-MONTH INTERVENTION. THERE WERE NO ADVERSE EVENTS RELATED TO THE INTERVENTION. THERE WERE NO EFFECTS FROM EITHER OF THE ACTIVE INTERVENTIONS ON EITHER OF THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES OF ATTENTION OR ALERTNESS. BOTH ACTIVE INTERVENTIONS PRODUCED IMPROVEMENT IN SECONDARY MEASURES OF FATIGUE COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP: ENERGY AND FATIGUE (VITALITY) ON THE SF-36 AND GENERAL FATIGUE ON THE MFI. THERE WERE NO CLEAR CHANGES IN MOOD RELATED TO YOGA OR EXERCISE. CONCLUSION: SUBJECTS WITH MS PARTICIPATING IN EITHER A 6-MONTH YOGA CLASS OR EXERCISE CLASS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN MEASURES OF FATIGUE COMPARED TO A WAITING-LIST CONTROL GROUP. THERE WAS NO RELATIVE IMPROVEMENT OF COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN EITHER OF THE INTERVENTION GROUPS.	2004	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
18  997  38 EFFECTS OF INTEGRATED YOGA INTERVENTION ON PSYCHOPATHOLOGIES AND SLEEP QUALITY AMONG PROFESSIONAL CAREGIVERS OF OLDER ADULTS WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE: A CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY. CONTEXT: PROVIDING CARE TO PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM CHRONIC NEUROLOGICAL PROBLEMS IS A STRESSFUL JOB. WHILE PROVIDING CARE TO THE PATIENTS, PROFESSIONAL CAREGIVERS EXPERIENCE VARIOUS KINDS OF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL CHALLENGES THAT AFFECT THEIR MENTAL HEALTH AND SLEEP. YOGA IS A FORM OF MIND-BODY MEDICINE SHOWN TO BE AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION IN IMPROVING PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF AN INTEGRATED YOGA (IY) INTERVENTION ON ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, STRESS, AND SLEEP QUALITY AMONG PROFESSIONAL CAREGIVERS OF OLDER ADULTS WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. SETTING: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN AN ALZHEIMER CARE INSTITUTION LOCATED IN BANGALORE CITY IN SOUTHERN INDIA. PARTICIPANTS: PARTICIPANTS WERE PROFESSIONAL FEMALE CAREGIVERS OF OLDER ADULTS WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. PARTICIPANT AGE RANGE WAS BETWEEN 20 AND 50 Y (MEAN, 34 +/- 8.4 Y). A TOTAL OF 30 PARTICIPANTS WERE ENROLLED IN THE STUDY. SEVENTEEN PARTICIPANTS FOLLOWED IY INTERVENTION AND 13 WERE CONSIDERED IN A WAIT-LIST GROUP. INTERVENTION: PARTICIPANTS IN THE IY GROUP RECEIVED A STRUCTURED IY INTERVENTION COMPRISING YOGA ASANAS, PRANAYAMA, MEDITATION, AND RELAXATION TECHNIQUES, 1 H/D, 6 D/WK, FOR 1 MO. PARTICIPANTS IN THE WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP FOLLOWED THEIR DAILY ACTIVITIES. OUTCOME MEASURES: BLOOD PRESSURE, HEART RATE, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, STRESS, AND SLEEP QUALITY WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AFTER 1 MO FOR BOTH THE GROUPS. DATA WERE ANALYZED WITH AN APPROPRIATE STATISTICAL TEST USING SPSS VERSION 16 SOFTWARE (IBM, ARMONK, NY, USA). RESULTS: THE IY GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN HEART RATE, BLOOD PRESSURE, STRESS, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND SLEEP QUALITY AFTER 1 MO COMPARED WITH BASELINE. IN CONTRAST TO THE IY GROUP, THE WAIT-LISTED CONTROL GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND STRESS AND SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN SLEEP QUALITY AFTER 1 MO COMPARED WITH BASELINE. CONCLUSIONS: THE PRESENT STUDY SHOWED THE POTENTIAL USE OF IY INTERVENTION IN REDUCING STRESS, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION. THE STUDY ALSO SUGGESTS THAT IY IMPROVES SLEEP QUALITY AMONG PROFESSIONAL CAREGIVERS. HOWEVER, FURTHER STUDIES USING A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL METHOD WITH A LARGER SAMPLE SIZE AND FOR A LONGER DURATION SHOULD BE CONDUCTED TO CONFIRM THE PRESENT FINDINGS.	2018	

19  171  42 A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY OF THE THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF YOGA IN PEOPLE WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE. BACKGROUND: EXERCISE CAN BE BENEFICIAL FOR CARDIOPULMONARY, MUSCULOSKELETAL OR NEUROLOGICAL SYSTEMS, AND OTHER FACTORS INCLUDING MOOD, AND MAY BE BENEFICIAL IN REDUCING FALL RISKS, DEMENTIA AND VARIABLES ASSOCIATED WITH QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD) PRODUCES PROGRESSIVE MOTOR AND COGNITIVE DETERIORATION THAT MAY LEAVE THOSE INFLICTED UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN STANDARD EXERCISE PROGRAMS. ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF EXERCISE SUCH AS YOGA MAY BE SUCCESSFUL IN IMPROVING PHYSICAL FUNCTION, QOL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL VARIABLES FOR OVERALL WELL-BEING. AIM: THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON PHYSIOLOGICAL AND HEALTH-RELATED QOL MEASURES IN PEOPLE WITH PD. METHODS AND MATERIALS: THIRTEEN PEOPLE WITH STAGE 1-2 PD WERE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER A YOGA (N = 8) OR A CONTROL GROUP (N = 5). THE YOGA GROUP PARTICIPATED IN TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA SESSIONS FOR 12 WEEKS. PARTICIPANTS WERE TESTED AT BASELINE, AND AT 6 AND 12 WEEKS USING THE UNIFIED PARKINSON'S DISEASE RATING SCALE (UPDRS), CLINICAL MEASURES OF HEALTH-RELATED QOL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN UPDRS SCORES (P = .006), DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (P = 0.036) AND AVERAGE FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (P = 0.03) WAS NOTED IN THE YOGA GROUP OVER TIME. CHANGES BETWEEN GROUPS WERE ALSO NOTED IN TWO SF-36 SUBSCALES. POSITIVE TRENDS OF IMPROVEMENT WERE NOTED IN DEPRESSION SCORES (P = 0.056), BODY WEIGHT (P = 0.056) AND FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME (P = 0.059). YOGA PARTICIPANTS REPORTED MORE POSITIVE SYMPTOM CHANGES INCLUDING IMMEDIATE TREMOR REDUCTION. CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY IMPROVE ASPECTS OF QOL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS IN STAGES 1-2 PD. FUTURE LARGER STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM AND EXTEND OUR FINDINGS OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN PD.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
20 2756  34 YOGA PRACTICE TO IMPROVE SLEEP QUALITY AND BODY COMPOSITION PARAMETERS OF OBESE MALE - A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND GLOBALLY OBESITY INCREASE IS A BIG CHALLENGE. OBESITY CAUSES MANY NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. OPTIONS TO CONTROL OBESITY ARE IN SEARCH. AIM: TO ASSESS THE OUTCOME OF 3 MONTHS FOLLOW-UP PERIOD, AFTER 14 WEEKS YOGA INTERVENTION, FOR BODY COMPOSITION AND SLEEP QUALITY PARAMETERS ON OBESE MALE IN URBAN SETTING. MATERIALS AND METHODS DESIGN: PARALLEL GROUP RCT (RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL) ON OBESE MALE. THE TWO GROUPS WERE YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS, WITH YOGA (N = 37, AGE 40.03 +/- 8.74), CONTROL (N = 35, AGE 42.20 +/- 12.06). THE IAYT (INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY) TRAINING WAS GIVEN TO YOGA GROUP FOR 14 WEEKS, AND THE UNSUPERVISED YOGA PRACTICE WAS CONTINUED BY THE SUBJECTS AT THEIR HOME, FOR FURTHER 3 MONTHS. TRAINING WAS 1.5 HOUR DAILY FOR 5 DAYS IN A WEEK, WHICH INCLUDED THE IAYT MODULE OF SURYANAMASKARA ASANA PRANAYAMA AND RELAXATION. NO YOGA ACTIVITY BUT WALKING ETC. FOR THE SAME TIME, WAS GIVEN TO CONTROL GROUP. BODY COMPOSITION PARAMETERS WERE ASSESSED THROUGH BIA (BIOELECTRICAL IMPEDANCE) METHOD USING INBODY R 20 MODEL. THE SLEEP QUALITY WAS ASSESSED USING PSQI (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX). WITHIN GROUP AND BETWEEN GROUP ANALYSIS WERE PERFORMED, USING SPSS VERSION 21. THE CORRELATION ANALYSIS WAS CARRIED OUT ON THE DIFFERENCE IN PRE FOLLOW-UP VALUES. RESULTS DURING THE FOLLOW-UP PERIOD WITHIN THE GROUP, THE BODY COMPOSITION PARAMETERS IMPROVED AND THE PARAMETERS OF QUALITY OF SLEEP SHOWED TRENDS OF IMPROVEMENT. ALSO SOME OF THE GAIN OBTAINED DURING 14 WEEKS INTERVENTION WAS LOST DURING FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. CONCLUSIONS THE CHANGES OBSERVED MAY INDICATE THE LONG-TERM BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE FOR CONTROL OF OBESITY IN URBAN SETTING FOR MALES.	2018

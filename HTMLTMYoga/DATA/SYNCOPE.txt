1  190 139 A RANDOMIZED STUDY OF YOGA THERAPY FOR THE PREVENTION OF RECURRENT REFLEX VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE. AIMS: VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE (VVS) IS A COMMON CARDIOVASCULAR DYSAUTONOMIC DISORDER THAT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTS HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE A POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON CARDIOVASCULAR AUTONOMICS. THIS STUDY ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA THERAPY ON THE RECURRENCE OF VVS AND QOL. METHODS AND RESULTS: WE RANDOMIZED SUBJECTS WITH RECURRENT REFLEX VVS (>3 EPISODES IN THE PAST 1 YEAR) AND POSITIVE HEAD-UP TILT TEST TO GUIDELINE-DIRECTED THERAPY (GROUP 1) OR YOGA THERAPY (GROUP 2). PATIENTS IN GROUP 1 WERE ADVISED GUIDELINE-DIRECTED TREATMENT AND GROUP 2 WAS TAUGHT YOGA BY A CERTIFIED INSTRUCTOR. THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT WAS VVS RECURRENCES AND QOL. BETWEEN JUNE 2015 AND FEBRUARY 2017, 97 HIGHLY SYMPTOMATIC VVS PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED (GROUP 1: 47 AND GROUP 2: 50). THE MEAN AGE WAS 33.1 +/- 16.6 YEARS, MALE:FEMALE OF 40:57, SYMPTOM DURATION OF 17.1 +/- 20.7 MONTHS, WITH A MEAN OF 6.4 +/- 6.1 SYNCOPE EPISODES. OVER A FOLLOW-UP OF 14.3 +/- 2.1 MONTHS GROUP 2 HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER SYNCOPE BURDEN COMPARED WITH GROUP 1 AT 3 (0.8 +/- 0.9 VS. 1.8 +/- 1.4, P < 0.001), 6 (1.0 +/- 1.2 VS. 3.4 +/- 3.0, P < 0.001), AND AT 12 MONTHS (1.1 +/- 0.8 VS. 3.8 +/- 3.2, P < 0.001). THE SYNCOPE FUNCTIONAL SCORE QUESTIONNAIRE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN GROUP 2 COMPARED WITH GROUP 1 AT 3 (31.4 +/- 7.2 VS. 64.1 +/- 11.5, P < 0.001), 6 (26.4 +/- 6.3 VS. 61.4 +/- 10.7, P < 0.001), AND 12 MONTHS (22.2 +/- 4.7 VS. 68.3 +/- 11.4, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: FOR PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT VVS, GUIDED YOGA THERAPY IS SUPERIOR TO CONVENTIONAL THERAPY IN REDUCING SYMPTOM BURDEN AND IMPROVING QOL.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
2 2471  47 YOGA AS A TREATMENT FOR VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: YOGA THERAPY IS BEING USED FOR VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE (VVS). HOWEVER, THERE IS NO SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE. WE AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT TO THE STANDARD THERAPY ON PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT VVS. METHODS: ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE SYSTEMATICALLY SEARCHED TO COLLECT STUDIES ASSESSING THE CLINICAL EFFECTS OF YOGA ALONG WITH GUIDELINE-DIRECTED TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT VVS. THE OUTCOMES WERE THE NUMBER OF VVS ATTACKS AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) ASSESSMENT BY SYNCOPE FUNCTIONAL STATUS QUESTIONNAIRE (SFSQ) SCORES AT 12 MONTHS. WE USED THE MANTEL- HAENSZEL RANDOM-EFFECTS MODEL TO CALCULATE THE MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI). WE USED THE COCHRANE COLLABORATION RISK OF BIAS TOOL AND NEWCASTLE-OTTAWA SCALE FOR RISK OF BIAS ASSESSMENT. RESULTS: FOUR STUDIES WERE INCLUDED, TWO RCTS AND TWO OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES. THE TOTAL OF PARTICIPANTS WAS 309, WITH A MEAN AGE OF 36.4 +/- 13.5 YEARS. THE MALE PARTICIPANTS REPRESENTED 141 (45.6%) BEING MALES. THE BASELINE SYNCOPE BURDEN WAS 3.5 +/- 2.38 EPISODES OVER 15.6 +/- 12.8 MONTHS. YOGA THERAPY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE NUMBER OF EPISODES OF SYNCOPE AND PRESYNCOPE COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP (MD -1.86; 95% CI -3.30, -0.43; P = 0.01). NEVERTHELESS, YOGA THERAPY DID NOT SHOW SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE QOL ASSESSED BY SFSQ SCORES (MD -30.69; 95% CI -62.22,0.83; P = 0.06). CONCLUSION: YOGA THERAPY IS A USEFUL LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION THAT CAN REDUCE THE FREQUENCY OF SYNCOPE AND PRESYNCOPE AMONG PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT VVS. HOWEVER, HIGHER-QUALITY RCTS ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM OUR RESULTS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
3  816  57 EFFECT OF YOGA ON CLINICAL OUTCOMES AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE (LIVE-YOGA). OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY AIMS TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT TO STANDARD THERAPY VERSUS STANDARD THERAPY ALONE ON THE SYMPTOMATIC BURDEN IN PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE (VVS). BACKGROUND: THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) OF PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT VVS. EXISTING MANAGEMENT THERAPIES HAVE BEEN LARGELY INEFFECTIVE. RECENT TRIALS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN DISEASES WITH AUTONOMIC IMBALANCE, SUGGESTING ITS POSSIBLE UTILITY IN VVS. METHODS: PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT VVS WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE EITHER A SPECIALIZED YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM IN ADDITION TO CURRENT GUIDELINE-BASED THERAPY (INTERVENTION ARM, GROUP 1) OR CURRENT GUIDELINE-BASED THERAPY ALONE (CONTROL ARM, GROUP 2). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS A COMPOSITE OF THE NUMBER OF EPISODES OF SYNCOPE AND PRESYNCOPE AT 12 MONTHS. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED QOL ASSESSMENT BY WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION QUALITY OF LIFE BRIEF FIELD QUESTIONNAIRE (WHOQOL-BREF) SCORES AND SYNCOPE FUNCTIONAL STATUS QUESTIONNAIRE SCORES AT 12 MONTHS, HEAD UP TILT TEST, AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY AT 6 WEEKS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 55 PATIENTS UNDERWENT RANDOMIZATION. THE MEAN NUMBER OF SYNCOPAL OR PRESYNCOPAL EVENTS AT 12 MONTHS WAS 0.7 +/- 0.7 IN THE INTERVENTION ARM COMPARED TO 2.52 +/- 1.93 IN THE CONTROL ARM (P < 0.01). IN THE INTERVENTION ARM, 13 (43.3%) PATIENTS REMAINED FREE OF EVENTS VERSUS 4 (16.0%) PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL ARM (P = 0.02). QOL AT 12 MONTHS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OF ALL SYNCOPE FUNCTIONAL STATUS QUESTIONNAIRE SCORES AND 2 DOMAINS OF WHOQOL-BREF SCORES (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: YOGA AS ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY IS SUPERIOR TO STANDARD THERAPY ALONE IN REDUCING THE SYMPTOMATIC BURDEN AND IMPROVING QOL IN PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT VVS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
4 1923  51 ROLE OF YOGA AS AN ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH NEUROCARDIOGENIC SYNCOPE: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: NEUROCARDIOGENIC SYNCOPE (NCS) IS A COMMON CLINICAL CONDITION CHARACTERIZED BY ABRUPT CARDIOVASCULAR AUTONOMIC CHANGES RESULTING IN SYNCOPE. THIS IS A RECURRING CONDITION WITH MIXED RESULTS FROM CURRENT STRATEGIES OF TREATMENT. METHODS: SUBJECTS WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF NCS WERE SCREENED AND ENROLLED. ALL THE PARTICIPANTS WERE GIVEN A DVD CONTAINING YOGA VIDEOS AND WERE INSTRUCTED TO PRACTICE YOGA THERAPY FOR 60 MIN, THREE TIMES A WEEK FOR 3 CONSECUTIVE MONTHS. SYNCOPE FUNCTIONAL STATUS QUESTIONNAIRE SCORE (SFSQS) WAS ADMINISTERED AT THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF THE STUDY. THE SUBJECTS WERE FOLLOWED FOR 3 MONTHS AND UNDERWENT REPEAT TILT TABLE TESTING AT THE END OF THE STUDY. RESULTS: OF THE 60 PATIENTS SCREENED, 44 SUBJECTS WERE ENROLLED, 21 IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP AND 23 IN THE CONTROL GROUP. MOST OF THE PARTICIPANTS WERE FEMALES, AND THE MEAN AGE WAS 21 +/- 3 YEARS. IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP, WHO FINISHED THE YOGA REGIMEN, THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT FROM CONTROL PHASE TO THE INTERVENTION PHASE, IN NUMBER OF EPISODES OF SYNCOPE (4 +/- 1 VS 1.3 +/- 0.7, P < 0.001) AND PRESYNCOPE (4.7 +/- 1.5 VS 1.5 +/- 0.5, P < 0.001). THE MEAN SFSQS ALSO DECREASED FROM 67 +/- 7.8 TO 29.8 +/- 4.6 (P < 0.001). ALL SUBJECTS HAD POSITIVE HEAD UP TILT TABLE (HUTT) STUDY AT THE TIME OF ENROLLMENT COMPARED TO ONLY SIX PATIENTS AT THE COMPLETION OF INTERVENTION PHASE (10/100 VS 6/28 %, P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: YOGA THERAPY CAN POTENTIALLY IMPROVE THE SYMPTOMS OF PRESYNCOPE AND SYNCOPE IN YOUNG FEMALE PATIENTS WITH NCS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
5 1501  20 INVERTED YOGA AND NEAR SYNCOPE: AN UNUSUAL DIAGNOSIS OF RIGHT VENTRICULAR MYXOMA. PRIMARY CARDIAC TUMORS ARE EXTREMELY RARE AND ARE DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE. ALTHOUGH USUALLY BENIGN IN NATURE, MYXOMAS REQUIRE SURGICAL RESECTION DUE TO THEIR INCREASED RISK OF EMBOLIC AND CARDIAC COMPLICATIONS, WITH THE TIMING OF RESECTION DEPENDENT ON THE PRESENTATION AND SIZE OF THE TUMOR. HOWEVER, IF DIAGNOSED EARLY, PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY BENIGN CARDIAC TUMORS HAVE EXCELLENT PROGNOSIS FOLLOWING SURGERY. THEREFORE, A HIGH INDEX OF SUSPICION AND A WIDE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN DETECTING RARE CONDITIONS THAT CAN AFFECT OTHERWISE HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS. WE PRESENT AN UNCOMMON CASE OF A RIGHT VENTRICULAR MYXOMA THAT WAS DISCOVERED WHEN THE PATIENT WAS PERFORMING INVERTED YOGA AND EXPERIENCED A NEAR SYNCOPAL EPISODE. PATIENT SUBSEQUENTLY UNDERWENT AN ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION AND WAS FOUND TO HAVE A RIGHT VENTRICULAR MYXOMA THAT WAS EXCISED. ALTHOUGH RECURRENCE IS RARE, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR PHYSICIANS TO REMAIN VIGILANT AND CONTINUE CAREFUL AND CONSISTENT FOLLOW-UP FOR PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF A CARDIAC MYXOMA.	2018

7  779  43 EFFECT OF YOGA AS ADD-ON THERAPY IN MIGRAINE (CONTAIN): A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AS AN ADJUVANT TO CONVENTIONAL MEDICAL MANAGEMENT ON CLINICAL OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS WITH MIGRAINE. METHODS: CONTAIN WAS A PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, OPEN-LABEL SUPERIORITY TRIAL WITH BLINDED ENDPOINT ASSESSMENT CARRIED OUT AT A SINGLE TERTIARY CARE ACADEMIC HOSPITAL IN NEW DELHI, INDIA. PATIENTS ENROLLED WERE AGED 18-50 YEARS WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF EPISODIC MIGRAINE AND WERE RANDOMIZED INTO MEDICAL AND YOGA GROUPS (1:1). RANDOMIZATION WAS COMPUTER-GENERATED WITH A VARIABLE BLOCK SIZE AND CONCEALED. A PREDESIGNED YOGA INTERVENTION WAS GIVEN FOR 3 MONTHS. OUTCOMES WERE RECORDED BY A BLINDED ASSESSOR. THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT WAS A DECREASE IN HEADACHE FREQUENCY, HEADACHE INTENSITY, AND HEADACHE IMPACT TEST (HIT)-6 SCORE. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED CHANGE IN MIGRAINE DISABILITY ASSESSMENT (MIDAS) SCORE, PILL COUNT, AND PROPORTION OF HEADACHE FREE PATIENTS. RESULTS: BETWEEN APRIL 2017 AND AUGUST 2018, 160 PATIENTS WITH EPISODIC MIGRAINE WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO MEDICAL AND YOGA GROUPS. A TOTAL OF 114 PATIENTS COMPLETED THE TRIAL. BASELINE MEASURES WERE COMPARABLE EXCEPT FOR A HIGHER MEAN HEADACHE FREQUENCY IN THE YOGA GROUP. COMPARED TO MEDICAL THERAPY, THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT MEAN DELTA VALUE REDUCTION IN HEADACHE FREQUENCY (DELTA DIFFERENCE 3.53 [95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL 2.52-4.54]; P < 0.0001), HEADACHE INTENSITY (1.31 [0.60-2.01]; P = 0.0004), HIT SCORE (8.0 [4.78-11.22]; P < 0.0001), MIDAS SCORE (7.85 [4.98-10.97]; P < 0.0001), AND PILL COUNT (2.28 [1.06-3.51]; P < 0.0003). CONCLUSION: YOGA AS AN ADD-ON THERAPY IN MIGRAINE IS SUPERIOR TO MEDICAL THERAPY ALONE. IT MAY BE USEFUL TO INTEGRATE A COST-EFFECTIVE AND SAFE INTERVENTION LIKE YOGA INTO THE MANAGEMENT OF MIGRAINE. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: CTRI/2017/03/008041. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: THIS STUDY PROVIDES CLASS III EVIDENCE THAT FOR PATIENTS WITH EPISODIC MIGRAINE, YOGA AS ADJUVANT TO MEDICAL THERAPY IMPROVES HEADACHE FREQUENCY, INTENSITY, IMPACT, AND DISABILITY.	2020

WE CONDUCT THIS META-ANALYSIS TO EXPLORE THE INFLUENCE OF YOGA THERAPY ON THE TREATMENT EFFICACY OF MIGRAINE. METHODS: WE HAVE SEARCHED PUBMED, EMBASE, WEB OF SCIENCE, EBSCO AND COCHRANE LIBRARY DATABASES THROUGH FEBRUARY 2021, AND INCLUDED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) ASSESSING THE EFFICACY OF YOGA THERAPY FOR MIGRAINE ATTACK. RESULTS: FIVE RCTS INVOLVING 356 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE META-ANALYSIS. OVERALL, COMPARED WITH CONTROL GROUP FOR MIGRAINE, YOGA THERAPY WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED HEADACHE FREQUENCY HEADACHE FREQUENCY (SMD = -1.43; 95% CI = -2.23 TO -0.64; P = 0.0004) AND HIT-6 SCORE (SMD = -2.19; 95% CI = -4.09 TO -0.28; P = 0.02), BUT REVEALED NO OBVIOUS INFLUENCE ON PAIN INTENSITY (SMD = -1.37; 95% CI = -2.76 TO 0.01; P = 0.05) OR MCGILL PAIN QUESTIONNAIRE (SMD = -2.09; 95% CI = -6.39 TO 2.22; P = 0.34). CONCLUSIONS: YOGA THERAPY MAY BENEFIT TO REDUCE THE HEADACHE FREQUENCY OF MIGRAINE PATIENTS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
9  798  41 EFFECT OF YOGA LIFESTYLE IN PATIENTS WITH HEART FAILURE: A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL. BACKGROUND: IN SPITE OF SIGNIFICANT ADVANCES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HEART FAILURE (HF), MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY REMAIN HIGH. THEREFORE, THERE IS A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL STRATEGIES. WE DID A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL TO STUDY EFFECT OF YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH HF IN TERMS OF QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), LEFT VENTRICLE EJECTION FRACTION (LVEF), C-REACTIVE PROTEIN (CRP), AND NTPROBNP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 60 PATIENTS WITH STABLE HF NEW YORK HEART ASSOCIATION CLASS II WITH LVEF 30%-40% WERE RANDOMIZED INTO CONTROL GROUP (CG) AND YOGA GROUP (YG). CG RECEIVED THE GUIDELINE-BASED THERAPY AND YG IN ADDITION PRACTICED THE YOGA, ONE HOUR DAILY FOR 3 MONTHS. ALL PATIENTS WERE ASSESSED FOR QOL, CRP, NTPROBNP, AND LVEF AT BASELINE AND AFTER 3 MONTHS. RESULTS: A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED IN ALL FOUR PARAMETERS IN THE YG AS COMPARED TO THE CG (P < 0.01) AFTER 12 WEEKS. QOL AS ASSESSED BY MINNESOTA LIVING WITH HEART FAILURE QUESTIONNAIRE SCORE IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY IN YG AS COMPARED TO CG (10 V/S 14, P < 0.001). THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT WITHIN YG IN TERMS OF LVEF (33.4-36.8, P = 0.001), AND THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN LVEF WAS SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN THE GROUPS (10% V/S 5%, P = 0.001). NTPROBNP ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BY 69.8% FROM 755 TO 220 PMOL/L IN YG AS COMPARED TO 39.3% IN CG (679-406 PMOL/L). CRP DECREASED BY 49.3% (5.36-2.73 MG/L) IN YG AND 35.8% (5.39-3.45 MG/L) IN CG. CONCLUSION: THE RESULT OF THIS PILOT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT ADDITION OF YOGA TO GUIDELINE-BASED THERAPY FOR HF PATIENTS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES QOL, LVEF, AND NTPROBNP AND REDUCES CRP LEVEL. LARGER STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE FINDINGS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
10  185  32 A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY ON CARDIAC FUNCTION AND N TERMINAL PRO BNP IN HEART FAILURE. AIMS: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE WHETHER YOGA TRAINING IN ADDITION TO STANDARD MEDICAL THERAPY CAN IMPROVE CARDIAC FUNCTION AND REDUCE N TERMINAL PRO B-TYPE NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE (NT PRO BNP) IN HEART FAILURE (HF). METHODS: 130 PATIENTS WERE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS: CONTROL GROUP (CG) (N = 65), YOGA GROUP (YG). IN YG, 44 PATIENTS AND IN CG, 48 PATIENTS COMPLETED THE STUDY. CARDIAC FUNCTION USING LEFT VENTRICULAR EJECTION FRACTION (LVEF), MYOCARDIAL PERFORMANCE INDEX (TEI INDEX), AND NT PRO BNP, A BIOMARKER OF HF, WAS ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND AFTER 12 WEEKS. RESULT: IMPROVEMENT IN LVEF, TEI INDEX, AND NT PRO BNP WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IN BOTH THE GROUPS. FURTHERMORE, WHEN THE CHANGES IN BEFORE AND AFTER 12 WEEKS WERE IN PERCENTAGE, LVEF INCREASED 36.88% IN THE YG AND 16.9% IN THE CG, TEI INDEX WAS REDUCED 27.87% IN THE YG AND 2.79% IN THE CG, NT PRO BNP WAS REDUCED 63.75% IN THE YG AND 10.77% IN THE CG. THE BETWEEN GROUP COMPARISONS FROM PRE TO POST 12 WEEKS WERE SIGNIFICANT FOR YG IMPROVEMENTS (LVEF, P < 0.01, TEI INDEX, P < 0.01, NT PRO BNP, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE ADDITION OF YOGA THERAPY TO STANDARD MEDICAL THERAPY FOR HF PATIENTS HAS A MARKEDLY BETTER EFFECT ON CARDIAC FUNCTION AND REDUCED MYOCARDIAL STRESS MEASURED USING NT PRO BNP IN PATIENTS WITH STABLE HF.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
11 1327  45 HIGH RATE OF RETURN TO YOGA FOR ATHLETES AFTER HIP ARTHROSCOPY FOR FEMOROACETABULAR IMPINGEMENT SYNDROME. BACKGROUND: FEMOROACETABULAR IMPINGEMENT SYNDROME (FAIS) IS MOST COMMONLY DIAGNOSED IN PATIENTS WHO PERFORM ACTIVITIES THAT REQUIRE REPETITIVE HIP FLEXION AND ROTATIONAL LOADING. YOGA IS AN ACTIVITY GROWING IN POPULARITY THAT INVOLVES THESE MOTIONS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE PATIENTS' ABILITY TO RETURN TO YOGA AFTER HIP ARTHROSCOPY FOR FAIS. HYPOTHESIS: THERE WOULD BE A HIGH RATE OF RETURN TO YOGA AFTER HIP ARTHROSCOPY. STUDY DESIGN: RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: LEVEL 4. METHODS: CONSECUTIVE PATIENTS WITH FAIS WHO HAD IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS PARTICIPATING IN YOGA AND HAD UNDERGONE HIP ARTHROSCOPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF FAIS BETWEEN 2012 AND 2015 WERE REVIEWED. DEMOGRAPHIC DATA WERE COLLECTED AND ASSESSED FOR ALL PATIENTS, AS WELL AS PREOPERATIVE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION, IMAGING, AND PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOME (PRO) SCORES, INCLUDING THE MODIFIED HARRIS HIP SCORE (MHHS), HIP OUTCOME SCORE ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING (HOS-ADL) AND SPORTS-SPECIFIC (HOS-SS) SUBSCALES, AND VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS) FOR PAIN. POSTOPERATIVELY, EXAMINATION AND PRO DATA WERE COLLECTED AT A MINIMUM 1 YEAR AFTER SURGERY, INCLUDING A YOGA-SPECIFIC QUESTIONNAIRE. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 42 PATIENTS (90% FEMALE; MEAN AGE, 35 +/- 9 YEARS; MEAN BODY MASS INDEX, 23.1 +/- 3.2 KG/M(2)) WERE INCLUDED. THIRTY PATIENTS (71%) HAD TO DISCONTINUE THEIR YOGA ROUTINE PREOPERATIVELY BECAUSE OF HIP-RELATED SYMPTOMS AT A MEAN 9.5 +/- 8.2 MONTHS BEFORE SURGERY. AFTER SURGERY, 39 PATIENTS (93%) WERE ABLE TO RETURN TO YOGA AT A MEAN 5.3 +/- 2.2 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY. TWO OF THE 3 PATIENTS WHO DID NOT RETURN TO YOGA NOTED LOSS OF INTEREST AS THEIR REASON FOR STOPPING, WHILE 1 PATIENT WAS UNABLE TO RETURN BECAUSE OF PERSISTENT HIP PAIN. NINETEEN PATIENTS (45%) RETURNED TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF YOGA PRACTICE, 17 PATIENTS (40%) RETURNED TO THE SAME LEVEL, AND 3 PATIENTS (7%) RETURNED TO A LOWER LEVEL. THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN THE NUMBER OF HOURS SPENT PRACTICING YOGA PER WEEK PRE- AND POSTOPERATIVELY (2.7 +/- 1.9 VS 2.5 +/- 1.3 HOURS; P = 0.44). ALL PATIENTS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ALL PROS AS WELL AS PAIN SCORES AFTER SURGERY (HOS-ADL, 67.4 +/- 18.3 TO 93.1 +/- 6.9 [ P < 0.001]; HOS-SS, 45.6 +/- 24.7 TO 81.5 +/- 18.8 [ P < 0.001]; MHHS, 62.3 +/- 11.3 TO 86.8 +/- 12.3 [ P < 0.0001]; VAS PAIN, 6.3 +/- 2.2 TO 0.90 +/- 1.1 [ P < 0.001]). CONCLUSION: PATIENTS PARTICIPATING IN YOGA RETURN TO YOGA 93% OF THE TIME AND AT A MEAN 5.3 +/- 2.2 MONTHS AFTER HIP ARTHROSCOPY FOR FAIS. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: INFORMATION REGARDING SURGICAL OUTCOMES IS CRITICAL IN COUNSELING PATIENTS, PARTICULARLY FEMALE ATHLETES, ON THEIR EXPECTATIONS WITH RESPECT TO RETURNING TO YOGA AFTER HIP ARTHROSCOPY FOR FAIS.	2018	

12 2154  31 THE EFFECTS OF THAI YOGA ON PHYSICAL FITNESS: A META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS. OBJECTIVES: THAI YOGA IS A TRADITIONAL THAI EXERCISE USED FOR IMPROVING HEALTH-RELATED PHYSICAL FITNESS. MANY STUDIES HAVE EVALUATED THESE EFFECTS, BUT THEIR RESULTS REMAIN INCONCLUSIVE. THIS META-ANALYSIS AIMED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THAI YOGA ON PHYSICAL FITNESS. DESIGN/METHODS: PUBMED, EMBASE, CINAHL, COCHRANE LIBRARY, THAI LIBRARY INTEGRATED SYSTEM (THAILIS), PHYSIOTHERAPY EVIDENCE DATABASE (PEDRO), NATIONAL REHABILITATION INFORMATION CENTER (REHABDATA), SCOPUS, WEB OF SCIENCE, THAI UNIVERSITY LIBRARY DATABASES/JOURNALS, AND THAI PHYSICAL THERAPY DATABASE UP TO MARCH 2016 WERE SEARCHED FOR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) EXAMINING THE EFFECT OF THAI YOGA EXERCISE COMPARED WITH NORMAL DAILY ACTIVITIES AS CONTROLS, IN ANY LANGUAGE. THE WEIGHTED MEAN DIFFERENCE (WMD) AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (95% CI) WERE PERFORMED USING THE RANDOM-EFFECTS MODEL. RESULTS: SEVEN RCTS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. THAI YOGA TRAINING SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED BODY FLEXIBILITY BY 3.9 CM AFTER 4 WEEKS [95% CI = 3.9-4.0; P < 0.001: NO HETEROGENEITY CHI(2) = 0.66, D.F.2, P = 0.7; I(2) 0.00%] AND 8.9 CM AFTER 8 WEEKS [95% CI = 7.4-10.5; P < 0.001: NO HETEROGENEITY CHI(2) = 0.16, D.F.2, P = 0.9; I(2) 0.00%] COMPARED TO CONTROLS. IT ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED RANGE OF MOTION (ROM) OF RIGHT SHOULDER EXTENSION BY 1.5 DEGREES AT WEEK 8, COMPARED TO CONTROLS [95% CI = 0.12-2.81; P = 0.03; LOW HETEROGENEITY CHI(2) = 1.61, D.F.1, P = 0.2; I(2) 37.9%]. GREATER ROM FOR RIGHT SHOULDER ABDUCTION WAS OBSERVED AFTER 12 WEEKS COMPARED TO CONTROLS [22.2 DEGREES (95% CI = 20-24; P < 0.001): NO HETEROGENEITY CHI(2) = 0.29, D.F.1, P = 0.6; I(2) 0.00%]. CONCLUSIONS: THAI YOGA EXERCISES APPEARED USEFUL, IN PARTICULAR, ON BODY AND RIGHT SHOULDER JOINT FLEXIBILITY. REGULAR STRETCHING EXERCISE OF THAI YOGA AND/OR IN COMBINATION WITH EXERCISES COULD PROMOTE HEALTH-RELATED PHYSICAL FITNESS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
13 2633  29 YOGA FOR TREATING HEADACHES: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: HEADACHE DISORDERS ARE CURRENTLY THE SIXTH LEADING CAUSE OF DISABILITY ACROSS THE GLOBE AND THEREFORE CARRY A SIGNIFICANT DISEASE BURDEN. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON HEADACHE DISORDERS. METHODS: MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, AND PSYCINFO WERE SCREENED THROUGH MAY 2019. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) WERE INCLUDED WHEN THEY ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF CHRONIC OR EPISODIC HEADACHE (TENSION-TYPE HEADACHE AND/OR MIGRAINE). USUAL CARE (NO SPECIFIC TREATMENT) OR ANY ACTIVE TREATMENTS WERE ACCEPTABLE AS CONTROL INTERVENTIONS. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES WERE HEADACHE FREQUENCY, HEADACHE DURATION, AND PAIN INTENSITY. FOR EACH OUTCOME, STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCES (SMD) AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CI) WERE CALCULATED. RESULTS: META-ANALYSIS REVEALED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT OVERALL EFFECT IN FAVOR OF YOGA FOR HEADACHE FREQUENCY (5 RCTS; STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE (SMD) = - 1.97; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) - 2.75 TO - 1.20; I(2) = 63.0%, TAU(2) = 0.25, P = 0.03), HEADACHE DURATION (4 RCTS; SMD = - 1.45; 95% CI - 2.54 TO - 0.37; I(2) = 69.0%, TAU(2) = 0.33, P = 0.02), AND PAIN INTENSITY (5 RCTS; SMD = - 3.43; 95% CI - 6.08 TO - 0.70, I(2) = 95.0%, TAU(2) = 4.25, P < 0.01). THE SIGNIFICANT OVERALL EFFECT WAS MAINLY DUE TO PATIENTS WITH TENSION-TYPE HEADACHES. FOR PATIENTS WITH MIGRAINE, NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT WAS OBSERVED. DISCUSSION: DESPITE DISCUSSED LIMITATIONS, THIS REVIEW FOUND PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE OF SHORT-TERM EFFICACY OF YOGA IN IMPROVING HEADACHE FREQUENCY, HEADACHE DURATION, AND PAIN INTENSITY IN PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM TENSION-TYPE HEADACHES. FURTHER STUDIES ARE URGENTLY NEEDED TO DRAW DEEPER CONCLUSIONS FROM THE AVAILABLE RESULTS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
14 1033  24 EFFECTS OF YOGA IN ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS: A META-ANALYSIS. AIMS/INTRODUCTION: A META-ANALYSIS WAS CARRIED OUT TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE PUBMED, EMBASE AND COCHRANE DATABASES WERE SEARCHED TO OBTAIN ELIGIBLE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE, AND THE SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN A1C, TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL, LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDE AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE. WEIGHTED MEAN DIFFERENCES AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CIS) WERE CALCULATED. THE I(2) STATISTIC REPRESENTED HETEROGENEITY. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 12 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WITH A TOTAL OF 864 PATIENTS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. THE POOLED WEIGHTED MEAN DIFFERENCES WERE -23.72 MG/DL (95% CI -37.78 TO -9.65; P = 0.001; I(2) = 82%) FOR FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE AND -0.47% (95% CI -0.87 TO -0.07; P = 0.02; I(2) = 82%) FOR HEMOGLOBIN A1C. THE WEIGHTED MEAN DIFFERENCES WERE -17.38 MG/DL (95% CI -27.88 TO -6.89; P = 0.001; I(2) = 0%) FOR POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE, -18.50 MG/DL (95% CI -29.88 TO -7.11; P = 0.001; I(2) = 75%) FOR TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, 4.30 MG/DL (95% CI 3.25 TO 5.36; P < 0.00001; I(2) = 10%) FOR HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL, -12.95 MG/DL (95% CI -18.84 TO -7.06; P < 0.0001; I(2) = 37%) FOR LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL AND -12.57 MG/DL (95% CI -29.91 TO 4.76; P = 0.16; I(2) = 48%) FOR TRIGLYCERIDES. CONCLUSIONS: THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT YOGA BENEFITS ADULT PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS. HOWEVER, CONSIDERING THE LIMITED METHODOLOGY AND THE POTENTIAL HETEROGENEITY, FURTHER STUDIES ARE NECESSARY TO SUPPORT OUR FINDINGS AND INVESTIGATE THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA IN TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS PATIENTS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
15  792  34 EFFECT OF YOGA IN CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE. YOGA IS ADJUNCTIVELY UTILIZED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN THE TREATMENT OF A VARIETY OF DISEASES, INCLUDING CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD), BUT THERE ARE NO STUDIES ASSESSING ITS ADJUNCTIVE EFFICACY IN THE UNITED STATES. WE PROSPECTIVELY EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA TRAINING ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AND THE PARAMETERS OF LUNG FUNCTION IN PATIENTS WITH COPD. THIRTY-THREE PATIENTS WITH DOCUMENTED COPD, PER GLOBAL INITIATIVE FOR OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE CRITERIA, WERE RECRUITED. ALL PATIENTS RECEIVED STANDARD COPD CARE. THE QOL WAS ASSESSED BY THE ST. GEORGE RESPIRATORY QUESTIONNAIRE. STANDARD SPIROMETRY AND MAXIMUM INSPIRATORY (MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE) AND EXPIRATORY PRESSURE (MAXIMAL EXPIRATORY PRESSURE) WERE MEASURED. PATIENTS WERE TAUGHT SELECTED YOGA EXERCISES INCLUDING BREATHING EXERCISES, MEDITATION, AND YOGA POSTURES FOR 1 HOUR, THRICE A WEEK FOR 6 WEEKS BY A CERTIFIED YOGA THERAPIST. THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND LUNG FUNCTION WERE AGAIN ASSESSED AT THE END OF 6 WEEKS. TWENTY-TWO PATIENTS COMPLETED THE STUDY. DIFFERENCES IN PREYOGA VERSUS POSTYOGA SCORES WERE EVALUATED USING PAIRED T-TESTS. STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS (P < 0.05) WERE OBSERVED FOR THE ST. GEORGE RESPIRATORY QUESTIONNAIRE [95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) 43.13-58.47], VITAL CAPACITY (95% CI 2.53-7.65), MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE (95% CI 6.62-23.64), AND MAXIMAL EXPIRATORY PRESSURE (95% CI 1.63-13.81). YOGA WHEN PRACTICED BY PATIENTS WITH COPD RESULTS IN IMPROVEMENT IN THE QOL AND LUNG FUNCTION ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE FINDINGS IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL AND IN THE LONGER TERM.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
16  221  28 A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF YOGA FOR HYPERTENSION. BACKGROUND: THE AIM OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS WAS TO EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE AND THE STRENGTH OF RECOMMENDATION FOR YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC MEANS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PREHYPERTENSION AND HYPERTENSION. METHODS: MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, CENTRAL, AND INDMED WERE SCREENED THROUGH FEBRUARY 2014 FOR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS (>/=8 WEEKS) COMPARED WITH USUAL CARE OR ANY ACTIVE CONTROL INTERVENTION ON BLOOD PRESSURE IN PATIENTS WITH PREHYPERTENSION (120-139/80-89 MM HG) OR HYPERTENSION (>/=140/>/=90 MM HG). RISK OF BIAS WAS ASSESSED USING THE COCHRANE RISK OF BIAS TOOL; QUALITY OF EVIDENCE WAS ASSESSED ACCORDING TO THE GRADE RECOMMENDATIONS. RESULTS: SEVEN RCTS WITH A TOTAL OF 452 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED. COMPARED WITH USUAL CARE, VERY LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE WAS FOUND FOR EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SYSTOLIC (6 RCTS, N = 278; MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) = -9.65 MM HG, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) = -17.23 TO -2.06, P = 0.01; HETEROGENEITY: I (2) = 90%, CHI(2) = 48.21, P < 0.01) AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (6 RCTS, N = 278; MD = -7.22 MM HG, 95% CI = -12.83 TO -1.62, P = 0.01; HETEROGENEITY: I (2) = 92%, CHI(2) = 64.84, P < 0.01). SUBGROUP ANALYSES REVEALED EFFECTS FOR RCTS THAT INCLUDED HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS BUT NOT FOR RCTS THAT INCLUDED BOTH HYPERTENSIVE AND PREHYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS, AS WELL AS FOR RCTS THAT ALLOWED ANTIHYPERTENSIVE COMEDICATION BUT NOT FOR THOSE THAT DID NOT. MORE ADVERSE EVENTS OCCURRED DURING YOGA THAN DURING USUAL CARE. COMPARED WITH EXERCISE, NO EVIDENCE WAS FOUND FOR EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SYSTOLIC OR DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE. CONCLUSIONS: LARGER STUDIES ARE REQUIRED TO CONFIRM THE EMERGING BUT LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE THAT YOGA MAY BE A USEFUL ADJUNCT INTERVENTION IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
17 1139  22 EFFICACY OF YOGA TRAINING IN CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE PATIENTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVES: TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF YOGA TRAINING IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD). METHOD: A LITERATURE SEARCH WAS PERFORMED IN PUBMED, COCHRANE LIBRARY, EMBASE, CINAHL, AND WEB OF SCIENCE FOR RELEVANT STUDIES PUBLISHED BEFORE JUNE 2017. QUALITY ASSESSMENT, SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS AND HETEROGENEITY WERE PERFORMED. STATA12.0 SOFTWARE WAS USED FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. RESULTS: TEN STUDIES WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS ANALYSIS. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN 6MWD (P = 0.000), BORG SCALE SCORES (P = 0.018), FEV1 VALUE (P = 0. 013), PACO2 (P = 0.037), SGRQ SCORES (P = 0. 000) AND CAT SCORES (P = 0.009) IN YOGA TRAINING PATIENTS. NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED IN THE FEV1/FVC (P = 0.75), FEV1 PREDICTED VALUE (P = 0.057) AND FVC (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: THIS META-ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT YOGA TRAINING CAN BE AN ACCEPTABLE AND APPROPRIATED ADJUNCTIVE REHABILITATION PROGRAM FOR COPD PATIENTS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
18 1818  44 PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF STANDARD ANTIEMETIC THERAPY WITH YOGA VERSUS STANDARD ANTIEMETIC THERAPY ALONE FOR HIGHLY EMETOGENIC CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA AND VOMITING IN SOUTH ASIAN POPULATION. AIM/BACKGROUND: CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA AND VOMITING (CINV) IS ONE OF THE MOST DISTRESSING SIDE EFFECTS OF HIGHLY EMETOGENIC CHEMOTHERAPY REGIMENS. THERE HAVE BEEN CONTINUOUS EFFORTS IN THE DIRECTION TO CONTROL CINV BY MANY INVESTIGATORS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RANDOMLY SELECTED PATIENTS WERE THOSE RECEIVING HIGHLY EMETOGENIC CHEMOTHERAPY REGIMEN GROUPED INTO YOGA AND STANDARD ANTIEMETIC THERAPY (N = 50) JUST BEFORE RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY AND CONTINUED FOR THE FOLLOWING DAYS AND OTHER GROUP (N = 50) RECEIVED ONLY THE STANDARD ANTIEMETIC AGENT. BOTH THE GROUPS WERE ASSESSED, FOLLOWED FOR ACUTE AND DELAYED ONSET OF CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED AND ANTICIPATORY NAUSEA AND VOMITING USING RADIATION THERAPY ONCOLOGY GROUP GRADING FOR THE SAME. WE ALSO ASSESSED THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF THE PATIENT USING THE FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CANCER THERAPY-GENERAL QUESTIONNAIRE. RESULTS: THE MEDIAN AGE GROUP OF THE PATIENTS WAS 51 YEARS WITH MALE:FEMALE RATIO 2:1, THE EASTERN COOPERATIVE ONCOLOGY GROUP (ECOG) PERFORMANCE STATUS WAS 0/1 IN 38% OF THE SELECTED POPULATION, WHILE ECOG 2 IN 62% OF THE PATIENTS. IN YOGA ARM, INSIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA (90% VS. 78%, P = 0.35) AND BUT SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN VOMITING (42% VS. 22%, P =0.01) WAS OBSERVED AS COMPARED TO THE STANDARD ANTIEMETICS ONLY ARM. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN GRADE 2 AND 3 NAUSEA (84% VS. 38% P < 0.01) AND VOMITING (14% VS. 0% P < 0.01). QUALITY OF LIFE IS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED IN THE YOGA ARM, ESPECIALLY IN THE ECOG 2 PERFORMANCE STATUS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY CONCLUDES THAT YOGA ALONG WITH STANDARD ANTIEMETIC MEDICATION SHOULD BE A PART OF THE MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR THE CANCER PATIENTS RECEIVING HIGHLY EMETOGENIC CHEMOTHERAPY.	2019

BACKGROUND: ASTHMA IS A CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY RESPIRATORY DISEASE CHARACTERIZED BY PERIODIC ATTACKS OF WHEEZING, SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND A TIGHT FEELING IN THE CHEST. THE CURRENT STUDY IS BASED ON THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE IN ASTHMATICS IN NORTHERN INDIA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 300 PARTICIPANTS OF MILD-TO-MODERATE PERSISTENT ASTHMA (FEV1 >60%) AGED BETWEEN 12 AND 60 YEARS WERE RECRUITED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PULMONARY MEDICINE. THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE WAS ASSESSED WITH THE HELP OF MINI ASTHMA QUALITY-OF-LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE (AQLQ) AT BASELINE AND THEN AFTER 3(RD) AND 6(TH) MONTH FROM BASELINE. FORTY-FIVE PARTICIPANTS WERE DROPPED OUT DURING THE STUDY WHILE 255 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE STUDY SUCCESSFULLY. RESULTS: IN "THE YOGA GROUP," SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE FOUND IN ALL THE SUBDOMAINS OF AQLQ AT 3(RD) MONTH AND AT 6(TH) MONTH IN COMPARISON TO "THE CONTROL GROUP." THE NUMBER NEEDED TO TREAT WAS FOUND TO BE 2.67 FOR THE TOTAL AQLQ SCORE WHICH WAS GREATER THAN THE MINIMAL IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE. CONCLUSION: "THE YOGA GROUP" GOT SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER IMPROVEMENT IN ASTHMA QUALITY-OF-LIFE SCORES THAN "THE CONTROL GROUP." THUS, YOGA CAN BE USED AS AN ADJUVANT THERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ASTHMA.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
20  167  36 A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED BICENTER TRIAL OF YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH COLORECTAL CANCER. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS TRIAL WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH COLORECTAL CANCER. METHODS: PATIENTS WITH NON-METASTATIC COLORECTAL CANCER WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A 10-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION (90 MIN ONCE WEEKLY) OR A WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS DISEASE-SPECIFIC QUALITY OF LIFE (FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CANCER THERAPY - COLORECTAL [FACT-C]) AT WEEK 10. SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED FACT-C SUBSCALES: SPIRITUAL WELL-BEING (FACT - SPIRITUALITY); FATIGUE (FACT - FATIGUE); SLEEP DISTURBANCES (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INVENTORY); DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY (HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE); BODY AWARENESS (SCALE OF BODY CONNECTION); AND BODY-EFFICACY EXPECTATIONS (BODY-EFFICACY EXPECTATIONS SCALE). OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED AT WEEK 10 AND WEEK 22 AFTER RANDOMIZATION. RESULTS: FIFTY-FOUR PATIENTS (MEAN AGE 68.3 +/- 9.7 YEARS) WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA (N = 27; ATTRITION RATE 22.2%) AND CONTROL GROUP (N = 27; ATTRITION RATE 18.5%). PATIENTS IN THE YOGA GROUP ATTENDED A MEAN OF 5.3 +/- 4.0 YOGA CLASSES. NO SIGNIFICANT GROUP DIFFERENCES FOR THE FACT-C TOTAL SCORE WERE FOUND. GROUP DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND FOR EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING AT WEEK 22 ( = 1.59; 95% CI = 0.27,2.90; P = 0.019), SLEEP DISTURBANCES AT WEEK 22 ( = -1.08; 95% CI = -2.13, -0.03; P = 0.043), ANXIETY AT WEEK 10 ( = -1.14; 95% CI = -2.20, -0.09; P = 0.043), AND DEPRESSION AT WEEK 10 ( = -1.34; 95% CI = -2.61, -0.8; P = 0.038). NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS OCCURRED IN THE YOGA GROUP, WHILE LIVER METASTASES WERE DIAGNOSED IN ONE PATIENT IN THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: THIS RANDOMIZED TRIAL FOUND NO EFFECTS OF YOGA ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH COLORECTAL CANCER. GIVEN THE HIGH ATTRITION RATE AND LOW INTERVENTION ADHERENCE, NO DEFINITE CONCLUSIONS CAN BE DRAWN FROM THIS TRIAL.	2016

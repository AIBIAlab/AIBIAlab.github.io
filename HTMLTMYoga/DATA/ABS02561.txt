1 2561 135 YOGA FOR CHRONIC NECK PAIN: A 12-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF A 9-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION ON CHRONIC NONSPECIFIC NECK PAIN 12 MONTHS AFTER COMPLETION. DESIGN: TWELVE-MONTH FOLLOW-UP OF THE POOLED DATA OF BOTH ARMS OF A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: DEPARTMENT OF INTERNAL AND INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE AT AN ACADEMIC TEACHING HOSPITAL. SUBJECTS: FIFTY-ONE PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC NONSPECIFIC NECK PAIN (MEAN AGE 47.8 YEARS; 82.4% FEMALE). INTERVENTIONS: A 9-WEEK YOGA GROUP INTERVENTION. OUTCOME MEASURES: NECK PAIN INTENSITY (100-MM VISUAL ANALOG SCALE), FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY (NECK DISABILITY INDEX), HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (SHORT-FORM 36 QUESTIONNAIRE, SF-36), GENERIC DISABILITY (DAYS WITH RESTRICTED ACTIVITIES), AND GLOBAL IMPROVEMENT. RESULTS: FROM BASELINE TO 12-MONTH FOLLOW-UP, PAIN INTENSITY IMPROVED FROM 48.81 +/- 17.71 TO 32.31 +/- 20.68 (P < 0.001), NECK-RELATED DISABILITY DECREASED FROM 25.26 +/- 9.02 TO 19.49 +/- 11.52 (P = 0.001), AND BODILY PAIN IN THE SF-36 IMPROVED FROM 49.37 +/- 12.40 TO 59.26 +/- 17.57 (P = 0.005). IMPROVEMENTS IN PAIN INTENSITY WERE PREDICTED BY WEEKLY MINUTES OF YOGA PRACTICE DURING THE PAST 4 WEEKS (R(2) = 0.12, P = 0.028); IMPROVED NECK-RELATED DISABILITY (R(2) = 0.24, P = 0.001) AND BODILY PAIN (R(2) = 0.26, P = 0.006) WERE PREDICTED BY REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE DURING THE PAST 12 MONTHS. GENERIC DISABILITY DID NOT DECREASE SIGNIFICANTLY. TWENTY-FOUR PATIENTS (68.6%) RATED THEIR HEALTH AS AT LEAST SOMEWHAT IMPROVED. CONCLUSIONS: A 9-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION IMPROVED PAIN AND NECK-RELATED DISABILITY FOR AT LEAST 12 MONTHS AFTER COMPLETION. SUSTAINED YOGA PRACTICE SEEMS TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT PREDICTOR OF LONG-TERM EFFECTIVENESS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
2 2653  52 YOGA IMPROVES OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE, DEPRESSION, AND DAILY ACTIVITIES FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC PAIN IS A COMPLEX ACCUMULATION OF PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS, THUS INTERVENTIONS THAT ADDRESS PAIN AND PROMOTE OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE ARE NEEDED. A HOLISTIC INTERVENTION, WITH MIND AND BODY COMPONENTS, IS LIKELY NECESSARY TO BEST TREAT THE COMPLEXITIES OF CHRONIC PAIN. THUS, WE DEVELOPED AND TESTED A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN. OBJECTIVES: IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL (RCT), PARTICIPANTS WITH CHRONIC PAIN WERE RANDOMIZED TO A YOGA INTERVENTION OR USUAL CARE GROUP. BETWEEN AND WITHIN GROUP DIFFERENCES FOR PRE-AND POST-OUTCOME MEASURE SCORES WERE ASSESSED FOR: OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE, COMPLETION OF ACTIVITIES, AND DEPRESSION. METHODS: PILOT RCT WITH PARTICIPANT ALLOCATION TO 8 WEEKS OF YOGA OR USUAL CARE. BOTH GROUPS RECEIVED ONGOING MONTHLY SELF-MANAGEMENT PROGRAMMING. DATA WERE COLLECTED BEFORE AND AFTER THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA OR USUAL CARE AFTER BASELINE ASSESSMENTS. DEMOGRAPHICS WERE COLLECTED AND MEASURES INCLUDED: CANADIAN OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE MEASURE (COPM) TO ASSESS OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE; THE 15-ITEM FRENCHAY ACTIVITIES INDEX (FAI)(ACTIVITIES); AND THE 9-ITEM PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE (PHQ-9) FOR DEPRESSION. INDEPENDENT T-TESTS WERE USED TO ASSESS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS. PAIRED T-TESTS WERE USED TO ASSESS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRE- AND POST 8-WEEK INTERVENTION FOR BOTH THE YOGA AND THE USUAL CARE GROUPS. PERCENT CHANGE SCORES AND EFFECT SIZES WERE CALCULATED. RESULTS: 83 PEOPLE WERE RECRUITED FOR THE STUDY AND COMPLETED BASELINE ASSESSMENTS; 44 INDIVIDUALS WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA AND 39 TO THE CONTROL GROUP. THE AVERAGE AGE OF ALL PARTICIPANTS WAS 51.4+/-10.5 YEARS, 68% WERE FEMALE; AND 60% HAD AT LEAST SOME COLLEGE EDUCATION. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN DEMOGRAPHICS OR OUTCOME MEASURES BETWEEN GROUPS AT BASELINE OR 8 WEEKS; HOWEVER, THE STUDY WAS NOT POWERED TO SEE SUCH DIFFERENCES. INDIVIDUALS RANDOMIZED TO THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE IN ANY OUTCOME MEASURE OVER THE 8 WEEKS. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN COPM PERFORMANCE AND COPM SATISFACTION SCORES FOR INDIVIDUALS RANDOMIZED TO THE YOGA GROUP; BOTH SCORES SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED. COPM PERFORMANCE IMPROVED BY 27% WITH A MODERATE TO LARGE EFFECT SIZE (3.66+/-1.85 VS 4.66+/-1.93, P < 0.001, D = 0.76). COPM SATISFACTION SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED BY 78% (2.14+/-2.31 VS. 3.80+/-2.50, P < 0.001) AND HAD A LARGE EFFECTS SIZE (D = 1.02). FAI SCORES IMPROVED, INDICATING INCREASED ACTIVITY OR ENGAGEMENT IN DAILY OCCUPATION DURING THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION. SCORES INCREASED BY 5% (38.13+/-8.48 VS. 39.90+/-8.57, P = 0.024) WITH A SMALL EFFECT SIZE (D = 0.37). DEPRESSION SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED FROM 13.21+/-5.60 TO 11.41+/-5.82, P = 0.041, WITH A SMALL EFFECT SIZE. CONCLUSION: DATA FROM THIS PILOT RCT INDICATE YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION WITH PEOPLE IN CHRONIC PAIN TO IMPROVE OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE, INCREASE ENGAGEMENT IN ACTIVITIES, AND DECREASE DEPRESSION. OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY PRACTITIONERS MAY CONSIDER ADDING YOGA AS A TREATMENT INTERVENTION TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH PAIN.	2019	

3  910  53 EFFECTIVENESS OF HATHA YOGA VERSUS CONVENTIONAL THERAPEUTIC EXERCISES FOR CHRONIC NONSPECIFIC LOW-BACK PAIN. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HATHA YOGA THERAPY IS COMPARABLE TO CONVENTIONAL THERAPEUTIC EXERCISES (CTES) FOR REDUCING BACK PAIN INTENSITY AND BACK-RELATED DYSFUNCTION IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC NONSPECIFIC LOW-BACK PAIN (CNLBP). DESIGN: THE STUDY WAS A PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED COMPARATIVE TRIAL, DIVIDED INTO TWO PHASES: AN INITIAL 6-WEEKLY SUPERVISED INTERVENTION PERIOD FOLLOWED BY A 6-WEEK FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. SETTINGS: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION AND CENTRE FOR INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE AND RESEARCH OF A TERTIARY CARE HOSPITAL. SUBJECTS: PATIENTS BETWEEN 18 AND 55 YEARS OF AGE WITH COMPLAINT OF CNLBP PERSISTING >/=12 WEEKS WITH PAIN RATING >/=4 ON A NUMERICAL RATING SCALE (0-10). INTERVENTION: A TOTAL OF SIX STANDARDIZED 35-MIN WEEKLY HATHA YOGA SESSIONS (YOGA GROUP) AND SIMILARLY 35-MIN WEEKLY SESSIONS OF CTES (CTE GROUP), DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE WITH CNLBP UNACCUSTOMED TO STRUCTURED YOGA OR CTE PROGRAM. PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO PRACTICE ON NONCLASS DAYS AT HOME. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES WERE DEFENSE AND VETERANS PAIN RATING SCALE (DVPRS) (0-10) AND 24-POINT ROLAND MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE (RDQ). SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE PAIN MEDICATION USAGE PER WEEK AND A POSTINTERVENTION PERCEIVED RECOVERY (LIKERT SEVEN-POINT SCALE) OF BACK-RELATED DYSFUNCTION. OUTCOMES WERE RECORDED AT THE BASELINE, 6-WEEK FOLLOW-UP, AND 12-WEEK FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: SEVENTY SUBJECTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER YOGA (N = 35) OR CTE GROUP (N = 35). DATA WERE ANALYZED USING INTENTION-TO-TREAT, WITH LAST OBSERVATION CARRIED FORWARD. BOTH YOGA AND THE CTE GROUP HAVE SHOWN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN BACK PAIN INTENSITY AND BACK-RELATED DYSFUNCTION WITHIN BOTH THE GROUPS AT 6- AND 12-WEEK FOLLOW-UPS COMPARED TO BASELINE. NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE PAIN INTENSITY (DVPRS; AT 6 WEEKS: N = 35, DIFFERENCE OF MEDIANS 1.0, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [-5.3 TO 3.0], P = 0.5; AT 12 WEEKS: N = 35, 0.0 [-4.2 TO 5.0], 0.7) AND BACK-RELATED DYSFUNCTION (RDQ; AT 6 WEEKS: N = 35, 1.0 [-9.6 TO 10.6], 0.4; AT 12 WEEKS: N = 35, 0.0 [-8.8 TO 10.6], 0.3) WERE NOTED BETWEEN TWO GROUPS. IMPROVEMENTS IN PILL CONSUMPTION AND PERCEIVED RECOVERY WERE ALSO COMPARABLE BETWEEN THE GROUPS. CONCLUSION: YOGA PROVIDED SIMILAR IMPROVEMENT COMPARED WITH CTES, IN PATIENTS WITH CNLBP.	2019

THE INTERVENTION WAS WELL-RECEIVED. CONCLUSIONS: AN INDIVIDUALLY TAILORED YOGA PROGRAM WAS ACCEPTABLE TO THESE PARTICIPANTS. PAIN AND QUALITY OF LIFE SCORES APPEARED TO IMPROVE.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
5 2833  33 YOGA'S EFFECT ON FALLS IN RURAL, OLDER ADULTS. BACKGROUND: UNINTENTIONAL FALLS AFFECT 30% OF PEOPLE OVER AGE 65 YEARS. YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE BALANCE. WE DESIGNED THIS STUDY TO EXAMINE IF YOGA REDUCES FALLS. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED 16 SESSIONS OF HATHA YOGA OVER 8 WEEKS. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO PRACTICE 10MIN OF YOGA DAILY AT HOME IN ADDITION TO 5-MIN RELAXATION EXERCISES OR RELAXATION EXERCISES ONLY (CONTROL GROUP). RESULTS: OF THE 38 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETING THE INTERVENTION, 15 PARTICIPANTS REPORTED A TOTAL OF 27 FALLS IN THE 6-MONTHS BEFORE THE STUDY, COMPARED TO 13 PARTICIPANTS SUSTAINING 14 FALLS IN THE 6 MONTHS FROM THE START OF THE STUDY (P<0.047), WITHOUT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOGA HOME-EXERCISE AND HOME RELAXATION-ONLY GROUPS. COMPARED TO BASELINE SCORES, ALL PARTICIPANTS IMPROVED ON THE BERG BALANCE SCALE (53-54 OUT OF 56, P=0.002), THE FUNCTIONAL GAIT ASSESSMENT (22.9-25.8 OUT OF 30 POINTS, P<0.001), AND THE DYNAMIC GAIT INDEX (20.6-22.4 OUT OF 24 POINTS, P<0.001). RIGHT LEG STAND TIME IMPROVED FROM A MEAN OF 13.3S TO 17.1S (P=0.020) AND STANDING FORWARD REACH DISTANCE FROM 26.0CM TO 29.6CM (P<0.001). WITHOUT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS. CONFIDENCE, WITH THE ACTIVITIES-SPECIFIC BALANCE CONFIDENCE SCALE, INCREASED IN THE YOGA HOME-EXERCISE GROUP (88%-93%, P=0.037) COMPARED TO 90% UNCHANGED FROM PRE-INTERVENTION IN THE HOME RELAXATION-ONLY GROUP. CONCLUSION: YOGA CLASSES REDUCE SELF-REPORTED FALLS AND IMPROVE BALANCE MEASURES. THE ADDITION OF HOME YOGA EXERCISES DID NOT ENHANCE BENEFIT OVER RELAXATION EXERCISE ONLY.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
6 2789  41 YOGA THERAPY FOR ABDOMINAL PAIN-RELATED FUNCTIONAL GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS IN CHILDREN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO COMPARE EFFECTS OF 10 WEEKS OF YOGA THERAPY (YT) AND STANDARD MEDICAL CARE (SMC) ON ABDOMINAL PAIN AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) IN CHILDREN WITH ABDOMINAL PAIN-RELATED FUNCTIONAL GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS (AP-FGIDS). METHODS: SIXTY-NINE PATIENTS, AGES 8 TO 18 YEARS, WITH AP-FGIDS, WERE RANDOMIZED TO SMC COMPLEMENTED WITH YT OR SMC ALONE. YT IS A MIXTURE OF YOGA POSES, MEDITATION, AND RELAXATION EXERCISES AND WAS GIVEN ONCE A WEEK IN GROUP SESSIONS. SMC CONSISTED OF EDUCATION, REASSURANCE, DIETARY ADVICE, AND FIBERS/MEBEVERINE, IF NECESSARY. PAIN INTENSITY (PAIN INTENSITY SCORE [PIS] 0-5) AND FREQUENCY (PAIN FREQUENCY SCORE [PFS] 0-4) WERE SCORED IN A PAIN DIARY, AND QOL WAS MEASURED WITH KIDSCREEN-27. FOLLOW-UP WAS 12 MONTHS. TREATMENT RESPONSE WAS DEFINED AS >/=50% REDUCTION OF WEEKLY PAIN SCORES. RESULTS: AT 1-YEAR FOLLOW-UP, TREATMENT RESPONSE WAS ACCOMPLISHED IN 58% OF THE YT GROUP AND IN 29% OF THE CONTROL GROUP (P = 0.01); NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES FOR OTHER TIME POINTS WERE FOUND. YT, AND NOT SMC, RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF PIS (P < 0.01) AND PFS (P < 0.01) AFTER 12 MONTHS. DURING THE STUDY, HOWEVER, YT WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY SUPERIOR COMPARED WITH SMC. SUBANALYSES FOR TIME POINTS DEMONSTRATED A SIGNIFICANT GREATER REDUCTION OF PIS AT 12 MONTHS IN FAVOR OF YT. NO DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND FOR QOL. YT WAS MORE EFFECTIVE IN THE REDUCTION OF REPORTED MONTHLY SCHOOL ABSENCE (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: AT 1-YEAR FOLLOW-UP, YT IN ADDITION TO STANDARD CARE WAS SUPERIOR COMPARED WITH SMC ACCORDING TO TREATMENT SUCCESS, PIS, AND REDUCTION OF SCHOOL ABSENCE. YT, HOWEVER, WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING PFS OR QOL, COMPARED WITH SMC.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
7 1852  39 RANDOMISED CLINICAL TRIAL: YOGA VS A LOW-FODMAP DIET IN PATIENTS WITH IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME. BACKGROUND: IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME IS THE MOST FREQUENT GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDER. IT IS ASSUMED THAT LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS MIGHT BE A RATIONAL TREATMENT APPROACH. AIM: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF A YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION VS A LOW-FODMAP DIET ON PATIENTS WITH IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME. METHODS: FIFTY-NINE PATIENTS WITH IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME UNDERTOOK A SINGLE-BLIND, RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL INVOLVING YOGA OR A LOW-FODMAP DIET FOR 12 WEEKS. PATIENTS IN THE YOGA GROUP RECEIVED TWO SESSIONS WEEKLY, WHILE PATIENTS IN THE LOW-FODMAP GROUP RECEIVED A TOTAL OF THREE SESSIONS OF NUTRITIONAL COUNSELLING. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS A CHANGE IN GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS (IBS-SSS). SECONDARY OUTCOMES EXPLORED CHANGES IN QUALITY OF LIFE (IBS-QOL), HEALTH (SF-36), PERCEIVED STRESS (CPSS, PSQ), BODY AWARENESS (BAQ), BODY RESPONSIVENESS (BRS) AND SAFETY OF THE INTERVENTIONS. OUTCOMES WERE EXAMINED IN WEEKS 12 AND 24 BY ASSESSORS "BLINDED" TO PATIENTS' GROUP ALLOCATION. RESULTS: NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND BETWEEN THE INTERVENTION GROUPS, WITH REGARD TO IBS-SSS SCORE, AT EITHER 12 (DELTA = 31.80; 95%CI = -11.90, 75.50; P = .151) OR 24 WEEKS (DELTA = 33.41; 95%CI = -4.21, 71.04; P = .081). WITHIN-GROUP COMPARISONS SHOWED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS FOR YOGA AND LOW-FODMAP DIET AT BOTH 12 AND 24 WEEKS (ALL P < .001). COMPARABLE WITHIN-GROUP EFFECTS OCCURRED FOR THE OTHER OUTCOMES. ONE PATIENT IN EACH INTERVENTION GROUP EXPERIENCED SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (P = 1.00) AND ANOTHER, ALSO IN EACH GROUP, EXPERIENCED NONSERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (P = 1.00). CONCLUSIONS: PATIENTS WITH IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME MIGHT BENEFIT FROM YOGA AND A LOW-FODMAP DIET, AS BOTH GROUPS SHOWED A REDUCTION IN GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS. MORE RESEARCH ON THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS OF BOTH INTERVENTIONS IS WARRANTED, AS WELL AS EXPLORATION OF POTENTIAL BENEFITS FROM THEIR COMBINED USE.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
8 1417  36 IMPORTANCE OF PATIENT EDUCATION FOR AT-HOME YOGA PRACTICE IN WOMEN WITH HORMONAL THERAPY-INDUCED PAIN DURING ADJUVANT BREAST CANCER TREATMENT: A FEASIBILITY STUDY. BACKGROUND: OSTEO-ARTICULAR PAIN (OAP) IS EXPERIENCED BY APPROXIMATELY 50% OF WOMEN UNDER HORMONAL THERAPY (HT) FOR BREAST CANCER (BC), WHICH INCREASES THE RISK FOR THERAPY DISCONTINUATION. THIS STUDY WAS AIMED TO ASSESS BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE COMBINED WITH PATIENT EDUCATION (PE) FOR AT-HOME PRACTICE BY EVALUATING FEASIBILITY AMONG BC PATIENTS UNDER HT AND MEASURING OAP, FLEXIBILITY AND SATISFACTION. METHODS: FEASIBILITY WAS EVALUATED BY PATIENT ADHERENCE AS ACCOMPLISHMENT OF AT LEAST 4 OUT OF 6 SUPERVISED YOGA-PE SESSIONS ALONG WITH 70% OR MORE AT-HOME YOGA SESSIONS. INTERVENTION (12 WEEKS) INCLUDED TWO 6-WEEKS PERIODS: P1 COMPRISING ONE 90-MINUTES SUPERVISED YOGA-PE SESSION/WEEK AND 15-MINUTES DAILY AT-HOME YOGA AND P2, DAILY AUTONOMOUS AT-HOME YOGA SESSIONS. EVALUATIONS (AT INCLUSION AND BY THE END OF EACH PERIOD) CONSISTED IN ASSESSMENT OF OAP ON VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS), FORWARD FLEXIBILITY (CM) AND PATIENT SATISFACTION ON LIKERT (0-10 POINTS) SCALE. RESULTS: BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 2018 AND MAY 2019 WE INCLUDED 24 PATIENTS OF MEDIAN 53 YEARS (RANGE 36-72). FEASIBILITY WAS VALIDATED BY 83% SUCCESSFUL ADHERENCE RATE. PAIN WAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED FROM MEDIAN VAS OF 6 [RANGE 4-10] TO 4 [RANGE 0-7] AT THE END OF BOTH P1 AND P2 (P < 0.01), ALBEIT WITH NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN P1 AND P2. FORWARD FLEXIBILITY IMPROVED BY A MEDIAN GAIN OF 8 CM (END OF P2) AND MEDIAN SATISFACTION SCORE OF 10/10 [RANGE 8-10]. CONCLUSION: COMBINED PHYSIOTHERAPY-YOGA-PE INTERVENTION IS A FEASIBLE STRATEGY TO INCREASE AT-HOME YOGA PRACTICE WITH POTENTIAL BENEFIT ON PAIN, FLEXIBILITY, AND SATISFACTION, THUS PROMPTING FURTHER EVALUATIONS IN LARGER RANDOMIZED MULTICENTER TRIALS.

9 2059  32 THE BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS: RESULTS OF A PRELIMINARY, STRUCTURED 8-WEEK PROGRAM. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO MEASURE THE EFFECTS OF A BI-WEEKLY RAJ YOGA PROGRAM ON RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA) DISEASE ACTIVITY. SUBJECTS WERE RECRUITED FROM AMONG RA PATIENTS IN DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES BY EMAIL INVITATIONS OF THE RA DATABASE. DEMOGRAPHIC DATA, DISEASE ACTIVITY INDICES, HEALTH ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRE (HAQ), AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) BY SF-36 WERE DOCUMENTED AT ENROLLMENT AND AFTER COMPLETION OF 12 SESSIONS OF RAJ YOGA. A TOTAL OF 47 PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED: 26 YOGA AND 21 CONTROLS. BASELINE DEMOGRAPHICS WERE SIMILAR IN BOTH GROUPS. PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT YOGA HAD STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN DAS28 AND HAQ, BUT NOT QOL. OUR PILOT STUDY OF 12 SESSIONS OF YOGA FOR RA WAS ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN RA DISEASE PARAMETERS. WE BELIEVE THAT A LONGER DURATION OF TREATMENT COULD RESULT IN MORE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
10 2173  27 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON DYSPNEA, SLEEP AND FATIGUE IN CHRONIC RESPIRATORY DISEASES. PURPOSE: THIS STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT TO FIND OUT THE EFFECTS OF YOGA APPLIED TO CHRONIC RESPIRATORY DISEASE PATIENTS ON DYSPNEA, SLEEP QUALITY AND FATIGUE. MATERIAL AND METHOD: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED BETWEEN MAY AND AUGUST 2020 AS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. 'PERSONAL INFORMATION FORM', 'RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS MONITORING FORM', 'COPD AND ASTHMA FATIGUE SCALE (CAFS), "ASTHMA AND COPD SLEEP IMPACT SCALE (CASIS)" AND MODIFIED MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL DYSPNEA SCALE (MMRC) WERE USED IN DATA COLLECTION. RESULTS: WHEN THE POST-TEST MEAN SCORES OF THE PATIENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUP WERE COMPARED, IT WAS FOUND THAT CAFS, CASIS AND MMRC MEAN SCORES OF THE PATIENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP DECREASED POSITIVELY COMPARED TO THE PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WAS FOUND TO BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: YOGA HAS BEEN FOUND TO REDUCE THE SEVERITY OF DYSPNEA AND FATIGUE AND IMPROVE SLEEP QUALITY IN CHRONIC RESPIRATORY DISEASES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
11 1246  29 FEASIBILITY OF INTEGRATION OF YOGA IN A BEHAVIORAL WEIGHT-LOSS INTERVENTION: A RANDOMIZED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE FEASIBILITY AND COMPARISON OF TWO STYLES OF YOGA WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A STANDARD BEHAVIORAL WEIGHT-LOSS INTERVENTION (SBWI). METHODS: FIFTY ADULTS WITH OBESITY (BMI: 31.3 +/- 3.8 KG/M(2) ) PARTICIPATED IN THIS 6-MONTH STUDY THAT INCLUDED A SBWI AND A CALORIE- AND FAT-REDUCED DIET. RANDOMIZATION WAS TO RESTORATIVE HATHA (SBWI+RES) OR VINYASA (SBWI+VIN) YOGA. YOGA WAS PRESCRIBED TO INCREASE FROM 20 TO 40 TO 60 MINUTES PER SESSION ACROSS THE INTERVENTION. WEIGHT WAS ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND 6 MONTHS. PERCEPTIONS OF YOGA WERE ASSESSED AT THE COMPLETION OF THE INTERVENTION. RESULTS: ADJUSTED WEIGHT LOSS WAS -3.4 KG (95% CI: -6.4 TO -0.5) IN SBWI+RES AND -3.8 KG (95% CI: -6.8 TO -0.9) IN SBWI+VIN (P < 0.001), WITH NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS. OF ALL PARTICIPANTS, 74.4% REPORTED THAT THEY WOULD CONTINUE PARTICIPATION IN YOGA AFTER THE SBWI. SESSION DURATION WAS A BARRIER AS YOGA INCREASED FROM 20 TO 40 TO 60 MINUTES PER DAY, WITH 0%, 7.5%, AND 48.8% REPORTING THIS BARRIER, RESPECTIVELY. CONCLUSIONS: AMONG ADULTS WITH OBESITY, YOGA PARTICIPATION, WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A SBWI, APPEARS TO BE FEASIBLE, WITH WEIGHT LOSS NOT DIFFERING BY STYLE OF YOGA. PROGRESSING TO 60 MINUTES PER SESSION APPEARS TO BE A BARRIER TO ENGAGEMENT IN YOGA IN THIS POPULATION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
12  459  43 CHANGES IN PAIN INTENSITY AND HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE WITH IYENGAR YOGA IN NONSPECIFIC CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. BACKGROUND: NONSPECIFIC CHRONIC LOW BACK (NCLBP) PAIN IS PREVALENT AMONG ADULT POPULATION AND OFTEN LEADS TO FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS, PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS, LOWER QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), AND HIGHER HEALTHCARE COSTS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF IYENGAR YOGA THERAPY ON PAIN INTENSITY AND HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) WITH NCLBP. AIM OF THE STUDY: TO COMPARE THE EFFECT OF IYENGAR YOGA THERAPY AND CONVENTIONAL EXERCISE THERAPY ON PAIN INTENSITY AND HRQOL IN NONSPECIFIC CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WITH RANDOM SAMPLING TECHNIQUE. SUBJECTS/INTERVENTION: SIXTY SUBJECTS WHO FULFILLED THE SELECTION CRITERIA WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO IYENGAR YOGA (YOGA GROUP, N = 30) AND CONTROL GROUP (EXERCISE GROUP, N = 30). PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED LOW BACK PAIN EVALUATION FORM AND HRQOL-4 QUESTIONNAIRE BEFORE THEIR INTERVENTION AND AGAIN 4 WEEKS AND 6 MONTH LATER. YOGA GROUP UNDERWENT 29 YOGIC POSTURES TRAINING AND EXERCISE GROUP HAD UNDERGONE GENERAL EXERCISE PROGRAM FOR 4 WEEKS. STATISTICS: REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA) WAS USED TO ANALYZE GROUP DIFFERENCES OVER TIME, WHILE CONTROLLING FOR BASELINE DIFFERENCES. RESULTS: PATIENTS IN BOTH GROUPS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PAIN AND IMPROVEMENT IN HRQOL. IN VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS) YOGA GROUP SHOWED REDUCTION OF 72.81% (P = 0.001) AS COMPARED TO EXERCISE GROUP 42.50% (P = 0.001). IN HRQOL, YOGA GROUP SHOWED REDUCTION OF 86.99% (P = 0.001) AS COMPARED TO EXERCISE GROUP 67.66% (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT IYENGAR YOGA PROVIDES BETTER IMPROVEMENT IN PAIN REDUCTION AND IMPROVEMENT IN HRQOL IN NONSPECIFIC CHRONIC BACK PAIN THAN GENERAL EXERCISE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
13 1969  40 SHORT TERM EFFECT OF YOGA ASANA - AN ADJUNCT THERAPY TO CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT IN FROZEN SHOULDER. BACKGROUND: THE AVAILABLE TREATMENTS FOR FROZEN SHOULDER YIELD VARIABLE RESULTS. PHYSICAL THERAPY AND ANALGESICS ARE CONSIDERED AS THE FIRST-LINE TREATMENT FOR THIS DISORDER, BUT THE EFFECTS ARE NOT UNIFORM. THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE MAY HAVE A ROLE IN ITS MANAGEMENT. OBJECTIVE(S): THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO EXAMINE THE SHORT-TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH FROZEN SHOULDER OF MILD TO MODERATE SEVERITY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED ON PATIENTS WITH FROZEN SHOULDER BETWEEN 30 AND 60 YEARS OF AGE. THEY WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: YOGA (Y) AND CONTROL (NY). A SET OF ASANA EXERCISES CALLED "STANDING GROUP OF ASANA" WAS PRACTICED BY THE YOGA GROUP IN ADDITION TO THE CONVENTIONAL THERAPY AS RECEIVED BY THE CONTROL GROUP. THE PATIENTS WERE REVIEWED AT 1, 2 AND 4 WEEKS. THE PAIN AND FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT WERE DONE AT BASELINE AND AT EACH REVIEW USING THE SHOULDER PAIN AND DISABILITY INDEX (SPADI). RESULTS: THERE WERE 16 MALE AND 20 FEMALE PARTICIPANTS IN THE Y GROUP, AND 15 MALES AND 21 FEMALES IN THE NY GROUP. THERE WAS NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN AGE, SEX, AND PRE-TREATMENT SPADI SCORE BETWEEN THE GROUPS. AT THE END OF THE FOUR WEEKS, THE SPADI PAIN SCORES IN THE Y AND NY GROUP WERE 20.47 AND 20.14, RESPECTIVELY (P = 0.666). THE SPADI DISABILITY SCORES IN THE Y AND NY GROUP WERE 20.4 AND 19.7, RESPECTIVELY (P = 0.599). OVERALL SPADI SCORES WERE 40.67 AND 40.03 IN THE Y AND NY GROUP, RESPECTIVELY (P = 0.736). BOTH GROUPS HAD A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SPADI PAIN AND DISABILITY SCORES. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GROUPS IN TERMS OF SPADI SCORES. CONCLUSION: THE EFFECT OF THE STANDING GROUP OF ASANA HAS NO ADDED ADVANTAGE RELATIVE TO STANDARD FROZEN SHOULDER TREATMENT WHEN PRACTICED FOR ONE MONTH.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
14  822  30 EFFECT OF YOGA ON FEV1, 6-MINUTE WALK DISTANCE (6-MWD) AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH COPD GROUP B. INTRODUCTION: YOGA IS USED IN THE TREATMENT OF VARIOUS DISEASES, INCLUDING CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE. HOWEVER, NO STUDIES HAVE ASSESSED THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON COPD PATIENTS IN INDONESIA. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS STUDY AND SIMILAR STUDIES COMPLETED IN OTHER COUNTRIES LIES IN THE TYPE OF YOGA EXERCISES COMPLETED, THE METHOD IN WHICH THEY WERE COMPLETED, AND IN CERTAIN, UNIQUE DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS. THIS STUDY AIMS TO ANALYZE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON FEV1, 6-MINUTE WALK DISTANCE, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH COPD GROUP B IN INDONESIA. MATERIAL AND METHODS: THIS ARTICLE REFLECTS RESEARCH DONE IN THE FORM OF AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY USING ARANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH PRE AND POST-TEST CONTROL GROUP DESIGN. THE SAMPLES WERE DIVIDED INTO 2 GROUPS: THE TREATMENT GROUP (YOGA PRACTICE FOR 1 HOUR, 2 TIMES AWEEK FOR 12 WEEKS) AND THE CONTROL GROUP (UNTREATED WITH YOGA, GIVEN LUNG REHABILITATION BROCHURE). ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECT OF YOGA EXERCISES ON LUNG FUNCTION PARAMETERS (FEV1), 6-MINUTE WALK DISTANCE AND QUALITY OF LIFE WERE USED USING SGRQ QUESTIONNAIRES IN COPD GROUP B. RESULTS: 33 COPD PATIENTS FULFILLED THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. 30 PATIENTS COMPLETED THE STUDY. PRE AND POST YOGA RESULTS WERE EVALU-ATED IN THE TREATMENT GROUP VERSUS THE CONTROL GROUP AND THEN FURTHER ASSESSED USING STATISTICAL TESTS. THERE WAS ASIGNIFICANT IN-CREASE IN FEV1, 6-MWD AND QUALITY OF LIFE USING ASGRQ QUESTIONNAIRE AFTER 12 WEEKS OF YOGA (P < 0.05) AS WELL AS AASIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN FEV1, 6-MWD AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE TREATMENT GROUP (P < 0.05) WHEN COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: YOGA AFFECTS FEV1, 6-MWD, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH GROUP B COPD.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
15   63  31 A COMPREHENSIVE YOGA PROGRAMS IMPROVES PAIN, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION IN CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN PATIENTS MORE THAN EXERCISE: AN RCT. INTRODUCTION: PREVIOUSLY, OUTPATIENT YOGA PROGRAMS FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) LASTING SEVERAL MONTHS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO REDUCE PAIN, ANALGESIC REQUIREMENT AND DISABILITY, AND IMPROVE SPINAL MOBILITY. THIS STUDY EVALUATED CHANGES IN PAIN, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND SPINAL MOBILITY FOR CLBP PATIENTS ON SHORT-TERM, RESIDENTIAL YOGA AND PHYSICAL EXERCISE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING COMPREHENSIVE YOGA LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS. METHODS: A SEVEN DAY RANDOMIZED CONTROL SINGLE BLIND ACTIVE STUDY IN AN RESIDENTIAL HOLISTIC HEALTH CENTRE IN BANGALORE, INDIA, ASSIGNED 80 PATIENTS (37 FEMALE, 43 MALE) WITH CLBP TO YOGA AND PHYSICAL EXERCISE GROUPS. THE YOGA PROGRAM CONSISTED OF SPECIFIC ASANAS AND PRANAYAMAS FOR BACK PAIN, MEDITATION, YOGIC COUNSELLING, AND LECTURES ON YOGA PHILOSOPHY. THE CONTROL GROUP PROGRAM INCLUDED PHYSICAL THERAPY EXERCISES FOR BACK PAIN, AND MATCHING COUNSELLING AND EDUCATION SESSIONS. RESULTS: GROUPXTIME INTERACTIONS (P<0.05) AND BETWEEN GROUP DIFFERENCES (P<0.05) WERE SIGNIFICANT IN ALL VARIABLES. BOTH GROUPS' SCORES ON THE NUMERICAL RATING SCALE FOR PAIN REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY, 49% IN YOGA (P<0.001, ES=1.62), 17.5% IN CONTROLS (P=0.005, ES=0.67). STATE ANXIETY (STAI) REDUCED 20.4% (P<0.001, ES=0.72) AND TRAIT ANXIETY 16% (P<0.001, ES=1.09) IN THE YOGA GROUP. DEPRESSION (BDI) DECREASED IN BOTH GROUPS, 47% IN YOGA (P<0.001, ES=0.96,) AND 19.9% IN CONTROLS (P<0.001, ES=0.59). SPINAL MOBILITY ('SIT AND REACH' INSTRUMENT) IMPROVED IN BOTH GROUPS, 50%, IN YOGA (P<0.001, ES=2.99) AND 34.6% IN CONTROLS (P<0.001, ES=0.81). CONCLUSION: SEVEN DAYS INTENSIVE RESIDENTIAL YOGA PROGRAM REDUCES PAIN, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION, AND IMPROVES SPINAL MOBILITY IN PATIENTS WITH CLBP MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN PHYSIOTHERAPY EXERCISES.	2012

OF THE 256 DIABETES PARTICIPANTS, ONLY 109 PEOPLE AGREED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM. OF 109 PEOPLE, 52 PEOPLE AGREED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE INTERVENTION (AGREED TO LEARN AND PRACTICE YOGA) WHILE THE REMAINING 57 PEOPLE WERE ASSIGNED TO NONINTERVENTION GROUP. RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING COULD NOT BE DONE. OBJECTIVE AND OUTCOME: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED WITH OBJECTIVE OF ASSESSING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA, PRANAYAMA, AND SUDARSHAN KRIYA IN THE COMMUNITY-BASED MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES MELLITUS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME VARIABLE WAS HB1AC AND SECONDARY OUTCOME VARIABLES WERE SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (SBP), DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (DBP), ADHERENCE TO MEDICATION, AND CHANGES IN LIFESTYLE. RESULTS: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED FOR 40 DAYS. COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS MADE A TOTAL OF 6 VISITS DURING THE STUDY. ALL THE 109 PARTICIPANTS WERE AVAILABLE FOR WEEKLY FOLLOW-UP. THERE WERE NO DROP OUTS AMONG THE STUDY POPULATION. STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE WAS SEEN IN THE CONSUMPTION OF VEGETABLE (CHI(2) = 15.326, P < 0.005), FRUITS (CHI(2) = 16.207, P < 0.005), SALTY FOOD (CHI(2) = 14.823, P < 0.005), BAKERY FOOD (CHI(2) = 10.429, P < 0.005) AND FRIED FOOD (CHI(2) = 15.470, P < 0.005), ADHERENCE TO METFORMIN (CHI(2) = 41.780, P < 0.005) AND OTHER MEDICATION(CHI(2) = 21.871, P < 0.005) AND PROPORTION OF PATIENTS WITH DBP UNDER CONTROL (CHI(2) = 9.396, P < 0.005) AND PROPORTION OF PEOPLE WITH GLUCOSE RANDOM BLOOD SUGAR UNDER CONTROL (CHI(2) = 29.693, P < 0.005) BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS FOLLOWING THE INTERVENTION. STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE WAS ALSO SEEN IN THE PROPORTION OF PEOPLE WITH SBP/DBP </=140/90 (CHI(2) = 10.635, P < 0.005) BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. CONCLUSION: THE YOGA PROGRAM WAS SUCCESSFUL IN IMPROVING DIETARY PRACTICES AND MEDICATION ADHERENCE AND IN INCREASING THE PROPORTION OF DIABETICS AND HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS UNDER CONTROL.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
17  712  32 EFFECT OF INTEGRATED YOGA ON ANTI-PSYCHOTIC INDUCED SIDE EFFECTS AND COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM SCHIZOPHRENIA. BACKGROUND TWENTY ONE (12 FEMALES) SUBJECTS, DIAGNOSED WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA BY A PSYCHIATRIST USING ICD-10, IN THE AGES 52.87 + 9.5YEARS AND SUFFERING SINCE 24.0 +/- 3.05YEARS WERE RECRUITED INTO THE STUDY FROM A SCHIZOPHRENIA REHABILITATION CENTER IN BENGALURU. METHODS ALL SUBJECTS WERE TAKING ANTI-PSYCHOTIC MEDICATIONS AND WERE IN STABLE STATE FOR MORE THAN A MONTH. PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATIONS WERE KEPT CONSTANT DURING THE STUDY PERIOD. ASSESSMENTS WERE DONE AT THREE POINTS OF TIME: (1) BASELINE, (2) AFTER ONE MONTH OF USUAL ROUTINE (PRE) AND (3) AFTER FIVE MONTHS OF VALIDATED INTEGRATED YOGA (IY) INTERVENTION (POST). VALIDATED 1H YOGA MODULE (CONSISTING OF ASANAS, PRANAYAMA, RELAXATION TECHNIQUES AND CHANTINGS) WAS PRACTICED FOR 5MONTHS, FIVE SESSIONS PER WEEK. ANTIPSYCHOTIC-INDUCED SIDE EFFECTS WERE ASSESSED USING SIMPSON ANGUS SCALE (SAS) AND UDVALG FOR KLINISKE UNDERSOGELSER (UKU) SIDE EFFECT RATING SCALE. COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS (USING TRAIL MAKING TEST A AND B), CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND ANTHROPOMETRY WERE ASSESSED AS SECONDARY VARIABLES. COMPARISONS BETWEEN "PRE" AND "POST" DATA WAS DONE USING PAIRED SAMPLES T-TESTS AFTER SUBTRACTING BASELINE SCORES FROM THEM RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS AT THE END OF FIVE MONTHS, SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DRUG-INDUCED PARKINSONIAN SYMPTOMS (SAS SCORE; P=0.001) AND 38 ITEMS OF UKU SCALE WAS OBSERVED ALONG WITH SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PROCESSING SPEED, EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS AND NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA PATIENTS. NO SIDE EFFECTS OF YOGA WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS THE PRESENT STUDY PROVIDES PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE FOR USEFULNESS OF INTEGRATED YOGA INTERVENTION IN MANAGING ANTI-PSYCHOTIC-INDUCED SIDE EFFECTS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
18  271  36 ADD-ON EFFECT OF HOT SAND FOMENTATION TO YOGA ON PAIN, DISABILITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN CHRONIC NECK PAIN PATIENTS. BACKGROUND: NECK PAIN IS ONE OF THE COMMONEST COMPLAINTS AND AN IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM ACROSS THE GLOBE. YOGA HAS REPORTED TO BE USEFUL FOR NECK PAIN AND HOT SAND HAS REPORTED TO BE USEFUL FOR CHRONIC RHEUMATISM. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO EVALUATE THE ADD-ON EFFECT OF HOT SAND FOMENTATION (HSF) TO YOGA ON PAIN, DISABILITY, QUALITY OF SLEEP (QOS) AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) OF THE PATIENTS WITH NON-SPECIFIC NECK PAIN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 60 SUBJECTS WITH NON-SPECIFIC OR COMMON NECK PAIN WERE RECRUITED AND RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO EITHER STUDY GROUP OR CONTROL GROUP. BOTH THE GROUPS HAVE RECEIVED YOGA AND SESAME SEED OIL (SESAMUM INDICUM L.) APPLICATION. IN ADDITION TO YOGA AND SESAME SEED OIL, STUDY GROUP RECEIVED HSF FOR 15 MIN PER DAY FOR 5-DAYS. ASSESSMENTS WERE TAKEN PRIOR TO AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION. RESULTS: RESULTS OF THE STUDY SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE SCORES OF VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE FOR PAIN, NECK DISABILITY INDEX (NDI), THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI), AND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PHYSICAL FUNCTION, PHYSICAL HEALTH, EMOTIONAL PROBLEM, PAIN, AND GENERAL HEALTH BOTH IN STUDY AND CONTROL GROUPS. HOWEVER, REDUCTIONS IN PAIN AND NDI ALONG WITH IMPROVEMENT IN SOCIAL FUNCTIONS WERE BETTER IN THE STUDY GROUP AS COMPARED WITH CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT ADDITION OF HSF TO YOGA PROVIDES A BETTER REDUCTION IN PAIN AND DISABILITY ALONG WITH IMPROVEMENT IN THE SOCIAL FUNCTIONING OF THE PATIENTS WITH NON-SPECIFIC NECK PAIN THAN YOGA ALONE.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
19  672  38 EFFECT OF A HOME-BASED SIMPLE YOGA PROGRAM IN CHILD-CARE WORKERS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECT OF A BRIEF, SIMPLE, HOME-BASED YOGA PROGRAM ON BODY PAIN AND HEALTH STATUS IN CHILD-CARE WORKERS. DESIGN: THIS WAS A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING A HOME-BASED YOGA GROUP AND A CONTROL GROUP. PARTICIPANTS: THE TRIAL COMPRISED 98 HEALTHY FEMALE NURSERY SCHOOL AND KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS. INTERVENTIONS: A DVD OF A SIMPLE HOME-BASED YOGA PROGRAM WAS PROVIDED FOR A PERIOD OF 2 WEEKS. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS THE REPORTED CHANGE IN BODY PAIN AT 2 WEEKS (AFTER INTERVENTION) AND 4 WEEKS (FOLLOW-UP). THE SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS THE 30-ITEM GENERAL HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE (GHQ30) SCORE AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION. RESULTS: THE 67 YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS REPORTED IMPROVED MENSTRUAL PAIN AT 4 WEEKS; MENSTRUAL PAIN WAS REDUCED FROM 57.0 +/- 27.8 TO 37.8 +/- 26.7 IN THE YOGA GROUP, VERSUS 52.4 +/- 36.5 TO 46.9 +/- 32.1 IN THE CONTROL GROUP (CHANGE FROM BASELINE IN THE YOGA GROUP VERSUS CHANGE FROM BASELINE IN THE CONTROL GROUP, -15.3 POINTS; P=0.044). THE TOTAL GHQ30 SCORE AND THE GHQ SUBSCALE SCORES ("SLEEP DISTURBANCE" AND "ANXIETY AND DYSPHORIA") IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY AT 4 WEEKS IN THE YOGA GROUP, BUT NOT IN THE CONTROL GROUP. IN THE GOOD-ADHERENCE GROUP, LOW BACK PAIN IMPROVED DURING THE INTERVENTION (P=0.006) AND FOLLOW-UP (P=0.001) PERIODS. MENSTRUAL PAIN WAS ALSO IMPROVED (P=0.044). NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE OBSERVED. CONCLUSIONS: A HOME-BASED SIMPLE YOGA PROGRAM MAY IMPROVE THE HEALTH STATUS OF CHILD-CARE WORKERS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
20 1292  37 GROUP YOGA EFFECTS ON CANCER PATIENT AND CAREGIVER SYMPTOM DISTRESS: ASSESSMENT OF SELF-REPORTED SYMPTOMS AT A COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER. BACKGROUND: COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH APPROACHES SUCH AS YOGA PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR PSYCHOSOCIAL HEALTH. WE EXPLORED THE EFFECTS OF GROUP-BASED YOGA CLASSES OFFERED THROUGH AN INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE CENTER AT A COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER. METHODS: PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS HAD ACCESS TO TWO YOGA GROUP CLASSES: A LOWER INTENSITY (YLOW) OR HIGHER INTENSITY (YHIGH) CLASS. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE EDMONTON SYMPTOM ASSESSMENT SYSTEM (ESAS; SCALE 0-10, 10 MOST SEVERE) IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND AFTER THE CLASS. ESAS SUBSCALES ANALYZED INCLUDED GLOBAL (GDS; SCORE 0-90), PHYSICAL (PHS; 0-60), AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS (PSS; 0-20). DATA WERE ANALYZED EXAMINING PRE-YOGA AND POST-YOGA SYMPTOM SCORES USING PAIRED T-TESTS AND BETWEEN TYPES OF CLASSES USING ANOVAS. RESULTS: FROM JULY 18, 2016, TO AUGUST 8, 2017, 282 UNIQUE PARTICIPANTS (205 PATIENTS, 77 CAREGIVERS; 85% FEMALE; AGES 20-79 YEARS) ATTENDED ONE OR MORE YOGA GROUPS (MEAN 2.3). FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS, WE OBSERVED CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION/IMPROVEMENT IN GDS, PHS, AND PSS SCORES AND IN SYMPTOMS (ESAS DECREASE >/=1; MEANS) OF ANXIETY, FATIGUE, WELL-BEING, DEPRESSION, APPETITE, DROWSINESS, AND SLEEP. CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT FOR BOTH PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS WAS OBSERVED FOR ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, FATIGUE, WELL-BEING, AND ALL ESAS SUBSCALES. COMPARING YOGA GROUPS, YLOW CONTRIBUTED TO GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN SLEEP VERSUS YHIGH (-1.33 VS -0.50, P = .054). IMPROVEMENT IN FATIGUE FOR YLOW WAS THE GREATEST MEAN CHANGE (YLOW -2.12). CONCLUSION: A SINGLE YOGA GROUP CLASS RESULTED IN CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL IMPROVEMENT OF MULTIPLE SELF-REPORTED SYMPTOMS. FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW YOGA CLASS CONTENT, INTENSITY, AND DURATION CAN AFFECT OUTCOMES.	2018

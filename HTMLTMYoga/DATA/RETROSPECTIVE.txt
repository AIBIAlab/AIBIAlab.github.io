1  258 192 ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF A 12-WEEK YOGA VS. EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS): STUDY PROTOCOL FOR A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS) IS A COMMON AND BURDENSOME SLEEP DISORDER ASSOCIATED WITH PROFOUND IMPAIRMENT OF HEALTH, WELL-BEING, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. UNFORTUNATELY, THE MEDICATIONS USED FOR RLS MANAGEMENT CARRY RISK OF SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS, INCLUDING AUGMENTATION OF SYMPTOMS. YOGA, AN ANCIENT MIND-BODY DISCIPLINE DESIGNED TO PROMOTE PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, AND MENTAL WELL-BEING, MAY OFFER A VIABLE, LOW-RISK NEW TREATMENT. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF THIS PILOT, PARALLEL-ARM, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) ARE TO ASSESS THE ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF A 12-WEEK YOGA VS. EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RLS. METHODS: FORTY-FOUR ADULTS WITH CONFIRMED MODERATE TO SEVERE RLS WILL BE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED TO A 12-WEEK YOGA (N = 22) OR STANDARDIZED EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM (N = 22). YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS WILL ATTEND TWO 75-MIN IYENGAR YOGA CLASSES PER WEEK FOR THE FIRST 4 WEEKS, THEN ONE 75-MIN CLASS PER WEEK FOR THE REMAINING 8 WEEKS, AND WILL COMPLETE A 30-MIN HOMEWORK ROUTINE ON NON-CLASS DAYS. EDUCATIONAL FILM GROUP PARTICIPANTS WILL ATTEND ONE 75-MIN CLASS PER WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS AND COMPLETE A DAILY RLS TREATMENT LOG; CLASSES WILL INCLUDE INFORMATION ON: RLS MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING SLEEP HYGIENE PRACTICES; OTHER SLEEP DISORDERS; AND COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES LIKELY TO BE OF INTEREST TO THOSE PARTICIPATING IN A YOGA AND SLEEP EDUCATION STUDY. YOGA AND TREATMENT LOGS WILL BE COLLECTED WEEKLY. FEASIBILITY OUTCOMES WILL INCLUDE RECRUITMENT, ENROLLMENT, AND RANDOMIZATION RATES, RETENTION, ADHERENCE, AND PROGRAM SATISFACTION. PROGRAM EVALUATION AND YOGA-DOSING QUESTIONNAIRES WILL BE COLLECTED AT WEEK 12; DATA ON EXPLORATORY OUTCOMES (E.G., RLS SYMPTOM SEVERITY (IRLS), SLEEP QUALITY (PSQI), MOOD (POMS, PSS), AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (SF-36)) WILL BE GATHERED AT BASELINE AND WEEK 12. DISCUSSION: THIS STUDY WILL LAY THE ESSENTIAL GROUNDWORK FOR A PLANNED LARGER RCT TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF A YOGA PROGRAM FOR REDUCING SYMPTOMS AND ASSOCIATED BURDEN OF RLS. IF THE FINDINGS OF THE CURRENT TRIAL AND THE SUBSEQUENT LARGER RCTS ARE POSITIVE, THIS STUDY WILL ALSO HELP SUPPORT A NEW APPROACH TO CLINICAL TREATMENT OF THIS CHALLENGING DISORDER, HELP FOSTER IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF RLS ETIOLOGY, AND ULTIMATELY CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCING THE INDIVIDUAL, SOCIETAL, AND ECONOMIC BURDEN ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CONDITION.

2 1215  50 EXPLORING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY AND PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES AFTER CANCER TREATMENT: A STUDY PROTOCOL. BACKGROUND: FOLLOWING CANCER TREATMENT, ADULTS COMMONLY REPORT WORSENED PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES (PROS) SUCH AS ANXIETY, STRESS, DEPRESSION, PERSISTENT AND UPSETTING COGNITIVE COMPLAINTS, UNRELENTING FATIGUE, AND REDUCED QUALITY OF LIFE. POORER PROS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DISRUPTED AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM FUNCTIONING AS MEASURED BY HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV), BOTH OF WHICH HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE HRV AND PROS AMONG ADULTS FOLLOWING CANCER TREATMENT ARE NEEDED. YOGA THERAPY HOLDS PROMISE AS AN INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE HRV AND PROS. THEREFORE, WE CONDUCTED A SINGLE-SUBJECT EXPLORATORY EXPERIMENTAL STUDY TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY ON HRV AND SPECIFIC PROS (IE, CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, ANXIETY, COGNITIVE FUNCTION, DEPRESSION, STRESS, QUALITY OF LIFE) IN ADULTS TREATED FOR CANCER. TO REDUCE PUBLICATION BIAS, IMPROVE REPRODUCIBILITY, AND SERVE AS A REFERENCE FOR FORTHCOMING REPORTING OF STUDY RESULTS, WE PRESENT THE STUDY PROTOCOL FOR THIS STUDY HEREIN. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE ADULTS WHO COMPLETED CANCER TREATMENT THAT WERE RECRUITED FROM THE OTTAWA INTEGRATIVE CANCER CENTRE. CONSENTING AND ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED ONE 1:1 YOGA THERAPY SESSION (IE, 1 PARTICIPANT, 1 YOGA THERAPIST) AND 6 WEEKLY GROUP-BASED YOGA THERAPY SESSIONS (IE, 2-3 PARTICIPANTS, 1 YOGA THERAPIST). PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED ASSESSMENTS 7 TIMES: 3 TIMES PRIOR TO THE PROGRAM (IE, -6 WEEKS, -3 WEEKS, IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE 1:1 YOGA THERAPY SESSION), IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE 1:1 YOGA THERAPY SESSION, PRIOR TO THE FIRST GROUP-BASED YOGA THERAPY SESSION, AFTER THE LAST GROUP-BASED YOGA THERAPY SESSION, AND AT A 6-WEEK FOLLOW-UP. HIERARCHICAL LINEAR MODELING WILL BE USED TO TEST THE AVERAGE EFFECTS OF THE YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM ACROSS PARTICIPANTS. DISCUSSION: THIS STUDY WILL EXPLORE SEVERAL NOVEL HYPOTHESES, INCLUDING WHETHER YOGA THERAPY CAN IMPROVE HRV AND/OR SPECIFIC PROS AMONG ADULTS TREATED FOR CANCER ACUTELY (IE, DURING A 1:1 YOGA THERAPY SESSION) AND/OR THROUGH REPEATED EXPOSURE (IE, AFTER COMPLETING 6 WEEKS OF GROUP-BASED YOGA THERAPY). ALTHOUGH THE FINDINGS WILL REQUIRE CONFIRMATION OR REFUTATION IN FUTURE TRIALS, THEY MAY PROVIDE INITIAL EVIDENCE THAT YT MAY BENEFIT ADULTS TREATED FOR CANCER.

3 1787  39 PREFERENCE AND EXPECTATION FOR TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF ONCE- VS TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. BACKGROUND: IN STUDIES INVOLVING NONPHARMACOLOGICAL COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE INTERVENTIONS, PARTICIPANT BLINDING IS VERY DIFFICULT. PARTICIPANT EXPECTATIONS MAY AFFECT PERCEIVED BENEFIT OF THERAPY. IN STUDIES OF YOGA AS TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PATIENT EXPECTATIONS AND PREFERENCES ON OUTCOMES. THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY BASELINE PREDICTORS OF PREFERENCE AND TO DETERMINE IF EXPECTATIONS AND PREFERENCES FOR DIFFERENT DOSES OF YOGA AFFECT BACK-RELATED FUNCTION AND LOW BACK PAIN INTENSITY. METHODS: THIS WAS A SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS OF A 12-WEEK RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING ONCE-WEEKLY VS TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA FOR TREATMENT OF CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN IN 93 ADULTS FROM A PREDOMINANTLY LOW-INCOME MINORITY POPULATION. AT BASELINE, PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED ABOUT BACK FUNCTION, BACK PAIN, TREATMENT EXPECTATIONS, AND TREATMENT PREFERENCES. WE CREATED A VARIABLE "CONCORDANCE" TO DESCRIBE THE MATCHING OF PARTICIPANT PREFERENCE TO RANDOMIZED TREATMENT. OUR OUTCOME VARIABLES WERE CHANGE IN BACK FUNCTION AND PAIN INTENSITY AFTER 12 WEEKS OF YOGA INSTRUCTION. WE PERFORMED LOGISTIC REGRESSION TO IDENTIFY PREDICTORS OF PREFERENCE FOR ONCE- OR TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA INSTRUCTION. WE CREATED LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS TO IDENTIFY INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN EXPECTATIONS, PREFERENCE, CONCORDANCE, AND OUTCOMES. RESULTS: WORSE BACK FUNCTION AT BASELINE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH 20% HIGHER ODDS OF PREFERRING TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA (OR 1.2, CI 1.1, 1.3). INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGHER EXPECTATION SCORES FOR TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA HAD 90% HIGHER ODDS OF PREFERRING TWICE-WEEKLY VS ONCE-WEEKLY YOGA (OR 1.9, CI 1.3, 2.7). INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGHER EXPECTATION SCORES FOR ONCE-WEEKLY YOGA HAD 40% LESS ODDS OF PREFERRING TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA (OR 0.6, CI 0.5, 0.9). AFTER CONTROLLING FOR BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS, WE FOUND NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TREATMENT OUTCOMES, PREFERENCE, EXPECTATION SCORES, OR CONCORDANCE. CONCLUSION: IN A POPULATION OF PREDOMINANTLY LOW-INCOME MINORITY PARTICIPANTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN, WORSE BACK FUNCTION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH PREFERENCE FOR MORE FREQUENT YOGA CLASSES. THOSE WHO PREFERRED MORE YOGA CLASSES HAD HIGHER EXPECTATIONS FOR THOSE CLASSES. TWELVE-WEEK CHANGE IN BACK PAIN INTENSITY AND BACK FUNCTION WERE NOT AFFECTED BY DOSING PREFERENCE, EXPECTATION SCORE, OR CONCORDANCE. MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO BETTER MEASURE AND QUANTIFY PREFERENCE, EXPECTATIONS, AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO OUTCOMES IN YOGA RESEARCH.	2015	

4  518  40 COMPARING ONCE- VERSUS TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN IN PREDOMINANTLY LOW INCOME MINORITIES: A RANDOMIZED DOSING TRIAL. BACKGROUND. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT ONCE-WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES ARE EFFECTIVE FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) IN WHITE ADULTS WITH HIGH SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. THE COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF TWICE-WEEKLY CLASSES AND GENERALIZABILITY TO RACIALLY DIVERSE LOW INCOME POPULATIONS ARE UNKNOWN. METHODS. WE CONDUCTED A 12-WEEK RANDOMIZED, PARALLEL-GROUP, DOSING TRIAL FOR 95 ADULTS RECRUITED FROM AN URBAN SAFETY-NET HOSPITAL AND FIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS COMPARING ONCE-WEEKLY (N = 49) VERSUS TWICE-WEEKLY (N = 46) STANDARDIZED YOGA CLASSES SUPPLEMENTED BY HOME PRACTICE. PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE CHANGE FROM BASELINE TO 12 WEEKS IN PAIN (11-POINT SCALE) AND BACK-RELATED FUNCTION (23-POINT MODIFIED ROLAND-MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE). RESULTS. 82% OF PARTICIPANTS WERE NONWHITE; 77% HAD ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD INCOMES <$40,000. THE SAMPLE'S BASELINE MEAN PAIN INTENSITY [6.9 (SD 1.6)] AND FUNCTION [13.7 (SD 5.0)] REFLECTED MODERATE TO SEVERE BACK PAIN AND IMPAIRMENT. PAIN AND BACK-RELATED FUNCTION IMPROVED WITHIN BOTH GROUPS (P < 0.001). HOWEVER, THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ONCE-WEEKLY AND TWICE-WEEKLY GROUPS FOR PAIN REDUCTION [-2.1 (95% CI -2.9, -1.3) VERSUS -2.4 (95% CI -3.1, -1.8), P = 0.62] OR BACK-RELATED FUNCTION [-5.1 (95% CI -7.0, -3.2) VERSUS -4.9 (95% CI -6.5, -3.3), P = 0.83]. CONCLUSIONS. TWELVE WEEKS OF ONCE-WEEKLY OR TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES WERE SIMILARLY EFFECTIVE FOR PREDOMINANTLY LOW INCOME MINORITY ADULTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN.

5 2831  54 YOGA VS. PHYSICAL THERAPY VS. EDUCATION FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN IN PREDOMINANTLY MINORITY POPULATIONS: STUDY PROTOCOL FOR A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN CAUSES SUBSTANTIAL MORBIDITY AND COST TO SOCIETY WHILE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTING LOW-INCOME AND MINORITY ADULTS. SEVERAL RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS SHOW YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT. HOWEVER, THE COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AND PHYSICAL THERAPY, A COMMON MAINSTREAM TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN, IS UNKNOWN. METHODS/DESIGN: THIS IS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL FOR 320 PREDOMINANTLY LOW-INCOME MINORITY ADULTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN, COMPARING YOGA, PHYSICAL THERAPY, AND EDUCATION. INCLUSION CRITERIA ARE ADULTS 18-64 YEARS OLD WITH NON-SPECIFIC LOW BACK PAIN LASTING >/= 12 WEEKS AND A SELF-REPORTED AVERAGE PAIN INTENSITY OF >/= 4 ON A 0-10 SCALE. RECRUITMENT TAKES PLACE AT BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER, AN URBAN ACADEMIC SAFETY-NET HOSPITAL AND SEVEN FEDERALLY QUALIFIED COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS LOCATED IN DIVERSE NEIGHBORHOODS. THE 52-WEEK STUDY HAS AN INITIAL 12-WEEK TREATMENT PHASE WHERE PARTICIPANTS ARE RANDOMIZED IN A 2:2:1 RATIO INTO I) A STANDARDIZED WEEKLY HATHA YOGA CLASS SUPPLEMENTED BY HOME PRACTICE; II) A STANDARDIZED EVIDENCE-BASED EXERCISE THERAPY PROTOCOL ADAPTED FROM THE TREATMENT BASED CLASSIFICATION METHOD, INDIVIDUALLY DELIVERED BY A PHYSICAL THERAPIST AND SUPPLEMENTED BY HOME PRACTICE; AND III) EDUCATION DELIVERED THROUGH A SELF-CARE BOOK. CO-PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES ARE 12-WEEK PAIN INTENSITY MEASURED ON AN 11-POINT NUMERICAL RATING SCALE AND BACK-SPECIFIC FUNCTION MEASURED USING THE MODIFIED ROLAND MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE. IN THE SUBSEQUENT 40-WEEK MAINTENANCE PHASE, YOGA PARTICIPANTS ARE RE-RANDOMIZED IN A 1:1 RATIO TO EITHER STRUCTURED MAINTENANCE YOGA CLASSES OR HOME PRACTICE ONLY. PHYSICAL THERAPY PARTICIPANTS ARE SIMILARLY RE-RANDOMIZED TO EITHER FIVE BOOSTER SESSIONS OR HOME PRACTICE ONLY. EDUCATION PARTICIPANTS CONTINUE TO FOLLOW RECOMMENDATIONS OF EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS. WE WILL ALSO ASSESS COST EFFECTIVENESS FROM THE PERSPECTIVES OF THE INDIVIDUAL, INSURERS, AND SOCIETY USING CLAIMS DATABASES, ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS, SELF-REPORT COST DATA, AND STUDY RECORDS. QUALITATIVE DATA FROM INTERVIEWS WILL ADD SUBJECTIVE DETAIL TO COMPLEMENT QUANTITATIVE DATA.

6  312  88 AN EXPLORATORY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF A 12-WEEK YOGA VERSUS EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME: FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY. OBJECTIVES: THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF THIS PILOT TRIAL WERE TO ASSESS THE STUDY FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF THE 12-WEEK YOGA AND EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAMS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS) IN PREPARATION FOR A FUTURE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS PILOT, PARALLEL-ARM, RANDOMIZED FEASIBILITY TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED AT TWO SITES, MORGANTOWN, WV AND COLUMBUS, OH. YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED 75-MIN IYENGAR YOGA CLASSES, TWICE WEEKLY FOR 4 WEEKS, THEN ONCE A WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS (16 TOTAL CLASSES), AND COMPLETED A 30-MIN HOMEWORK ROUTINE ON NONCLASS DAYS. EDUCATIONAL FILM GROUP PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED ONCE WEEKLY, 75-MIN CLASSES (12 TOTAL CLASSES), WHICH INCLUDED INFORMATION ON RLS AND OTHER SLEEP DISORDERS, RLS MANAGEMENT INCLUDING SLEEP HYGIENE PRACTICES, AND COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES. FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OUTCOMES INCLUDED PROGRAM SATISFACTION AND RECRUITMENT, RETENTION, AND ADHERENCE RATES. IN ADDITION, PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED THEIR PREFERENCES REGARDING THREE YOGA CLASS SCHEDULE SCENARIOS FOR A FUTURE STUDY. ATTENDANCE, YOGA, AND TREATMENT LOGS WERE COLLECTED WEEKLY. PROGRAM EVALUATION AND YOGA SCHEDULING QUESTIONNAIRES WERE COLLECTED AT WEEK 12. RESULTS: FORTY-ONE ADULTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE RLS WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 12-WEEK YOGA (N = 19) OR EDUCATIONAL FILM (N = 22) PROGRAM. THIRTY PARTICIPANTS (73%) COMPLETED THE PROGRAM. YOGA AND EDUCATION GROUP PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED AN AVERAGE OF 13.0 +/- 0.84 (81%) AND 10.3 +/- 0.3 CLASSES (85%), RESPECTIVELY. PARTICIPANTS FROM BOTH GROUPS INDICATED SATISFACTION WITH THE STUDY. ALL YOGA GROUP RESPONDENTS TO THE PROGRAM EVALUATION REPORTED THEY WOULD LIKELY (N = 6) OR VERY LIKELY (N = 7) CONTINUE YOGA PRACTICE; 86.7% OF EDUCATION GROUP RESPONDENTS (13 OF 15) INDICATED THAT THEY WERE LIKELY (N = 7) OR VERY LIKELY (N = 6) TO MAKE LASTING CHANGES BASED ON WHAT THEY HAD LEARNED. THE PREFERRED SCHEDULE FOR A FUTURE STUDY WAS A 16-WEEK STUDY WITH ONCE-WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES. CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT A LARGER RCT COMPARING YOGA WITH AN EDUCATIONAL FILM GROUP FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RLS IS FEASIBLE.

7 2811  51 YOGA TO PREVENT MOBILITY LIMITATIONS IN OLDER ADULTS: FEASIBILITY OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: THE LOSS OF MOBILITY DURING AGING IMPACTS INDEPENDENCE AND LEADS TO FURTHER DISABILITY, MORBIDITY, AND REDUCED LIFE EXPECTANCY. OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND SAFETY OF CONDUCTING A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA FOR OLDER ADULTS AT RISK FOR MOBILITY LIMITATIONS. METHODS: SEDENTARY OLDER ADULTS (N = 46; AGE 60-89) WERE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED TO EITHER YOGA OR A HEALTH EDUCATION COMPARISON GROUP. YOGA SESSIONS (60-MIN) OCCURRED 2X WEEKLY, AND 90-MIN HEALTH EDUCATION SESSIONS OCCURRED WEEKLY, FOR 10 WEEKS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE RECRUITMENT RATE, INTERVENTION ATTENDANCE, AND RETENTION AT ASSESSMENTS. ADVERSE EVENT RATES AND PARTICIPANT SATISFACTION WERE ALSO MEASURED. PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES OF GAIT, BALANCE, AND STRENGTH AND SELF-REPORT OUTCOME MEASURES WERE ADMINISTERED AT BASELINE AND 10-WEEKS. RESULTS: RECRUITMENT LASTED 6 MONTHS. RETENTION OF PARTICIPANTS AT THE 10-WEEK FOLLOW-UP WAS HIGH (89% - PERFORMANCE MEASURES; 98% - SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES). ATTENDANCE WAS GOOD WITH 82% OF YOGA AND 74% OF HEALTH EDUCATION PARTICIPANTS ATTENDING AT LEAST 50% OF THE SESSIONS. NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. PATIENT SATISFACTION WITH THE INTERVENTIONS WAS HIGH. THE MEAN EFFECT SIZE FOR THE PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES WAS 0.35 WITH SOME OVER 0.50. THE MEAN EFFECT SIZE FOR SELF-REPORT OUTCOME MEASURES WAS 0.36. CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS INDICATE THAT IT IS FEASIBLE TO CONDUCT A LARGER RCT OF YOGA FOR SEDENTARY OLDER ADULTS AT RISK FOR MOBILITY PROBLEMS. THE YOGA AND COMPARISON INTERVENTIONS WERE SAFE, WELL ACCEPTED, AND WELL ATTENDED. EFFECT SIZES SUGGEST YOGA MAY HAVE IMPORTANT BENEFITS FOR THIS POPULATION AND SHOULD BE STUDIED FURTHER.

8  945  72 EFFECTS OF A 12-WEEK YOGA VERSUS A 12-WEEK EDUCATIONAL FILM INTERVENTION ON SYMPTOMS OF RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME AND RELATED OUTCOMES: AN EXPLORATORY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. STUDY OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA VERSUS EDUCATIONAL FILM (EF) PROGRAM ON RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS) SYMPTOMS AND RELATED OUTCOMES IN ADULTS WITH RLS. METHODS: FORTY-ONE COMMUNITY-DWELLING, AMBULATORY NONPREGNANT ADULTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE RLS WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 12-WEEK YOGA (N = 19) OR EF PROGRAM (N = 22). IN ADDITION TO ATTENDING CLASSES, ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED PRACTICE/TREATMENT LOGS. YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO PRACTICE AT HOME 30 MINUTES PER DAY ON NONCLASS DAYS; EF PARTICIPANTS WERE INSTRUCTED TO RECORD ANY RLS TREATMENTS USED ON THEIR DAILY LOGS. CORE OUTCOMES ASSESSED PRETREATMENT AND POSTTREATMENT WERE RLS SYMPTOMS AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY (INTERNATIONAL RLS STUDY GROUP SCALE (IRLS) AND RLS ORDINAL SCALE), SLEEP QUALITY, MOOD, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). RESULTS: THIRTY ADULTS (13 YOGA, 17 EF), AGED 24 TO 73 (MEAN = 50.4 +/- 2.4 YEARS), COMPLETED THE 12-WEEK STUDY (78% FEMALE, 80.5% WHITE). POST-INTERVENTION, BOTH GROUPS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN RLS SYMPTOMS AND SEVERITY, PERCEIVED STRESS, MOOD, AND QOL-MENTAL HEALTH (P </= .04). RELATIVE TO THE EF GROUP, YOGA PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER REDUCTIONS IN RLS SYMPTOMS AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY (P </= .01), AND GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN PERCEIVED STRESS AND MOOD (P </= .04), AS WELL AS SLEEP QUALITY (P = .09); RLS SYMPTOMS DECREASED TO MINIMAL/MILD IN 77% OF YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS, WITH NONE SCORING IN THE SEVERE RANGE BY WEEK 12, VERSUS 24% AND 12%, RESPECTIVELY, IN EF PARTICIPANTS. IN THE YOGA GROUP, IRLS AND RLS SEVERITY SCORES DECLINED WITH INCREASING MINUTES OF HOMEWORK PRACTICE (R = .7, P = .009 AND R = .6, P = .03, RESPECTIVELY), SUGGESTING A POSSIBLE DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS OF THIS EXPLORATORY RCT SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING RLS SYMPTOMS AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY, DECREASING PERCEIVED STRESS, AND IMPROVING MOOD AND SLEEP IN ADULTS WITH RLS.

9  193  41 A RANDOMIZED TRIAL COMPARING YOGA, STRETCHING, AND A SELF-CARE BOOK FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN IS A COMMON PROBLEM LACKING HIGHLY EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS. SMALL TRIALS SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY HAVE BENEFITS FOR THIS CONDITION. THIS TRIAL WAS DESIGNED TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOGA IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN CONVENTIONAL STRETCHING EXERCISES OR A SELF-CARE BOOK FOR PRIMARY CARE PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 228 ADULTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN WERE RANDOMIZED TO 12 WEEKLY CLASSES OF YOGA (92 PATIENTS) OR CONVENTIONAL STRETCHING EXERCISES (91 PATIENTS) OR A SELF-CARE BOOK (45 PATIENTS). BACK-RELATED FUNCTIONAL STATUS (MODIFIED ROLAND DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE, A 23-POINT SCALE) AND BOTHERSOMENESS OF PAIN (AN 11-POINT NUMERICAL SCALE) AT 12 WEEKS WERE THE PRIMARY OUTCOMES. OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE, 6, 12, AND 26 WEEKS BY INTERVIEWERS UNAWARE OF TREATMENT GROUP. RESULTS: AFTER ADJUSTMENT FOR BASELINE VALUES, 12-WEEK OUTCOMES FOR THE YOGA GROUP WERE SUPERIOR TO THOSE FOR THE SELF-CARE GROUP (MEAN DIFFERENCE FOR FUNCTION, -2.5 [95% CI, -3.7 TO -1.3]; P < .001; MEAN DIFFERENCE FOR SYMPTOMS, -1.1 [95% CI, -1.7 TO -0.4]; P < .001). AT 26 WEEKS, FUNCTION FOR THE YOGA GROUP REMAINED SUPERIOR (MEAN DIFFERENCE, -1.8 [95% CI, -3.1 TO -0.5]; P < .001). YOGA WAS NOT SUPERIOR TO CONVENTIONAL STRETCHING EXERCISES AT ANY TIME POINT. CONCLUSION: YOGA CLASSES WERE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN A SELF-CARE BOOK, BUT NOT MORE EFFECTIVE THAN STRETCHING CLASSES, IN IMPROVING FUNCTION AND REDUCING SYMPTOMS DUE TO CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN, WITH BENEFITS LASTING AT LEAST SEVERAL MONTHS.

10 1107  42 EFFECTS OF YOGA, STRENGTH TRAINING AND ADVICE ON BACK PAIN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: AMONG THE WORKING POPULATION, NON-SPECIFIC LOW-BACK PAIN AND NECK PAIN ARE ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR SICKNESS ABSENTEEISM. THE AIM WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF AN EARLY INTERVENTION OF YOGA - COMPARED WITH STRENGTH TRAINING OR EVIDENCE-BASED ADVICE - ON SICKNESS ABSENTEEISM, SICKNESS PRESENTEEISM, BACK AND NECK PAIN AND DISABILITY AMONG A WORKING POPULATION. METHODS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED ON 159 PARTICIPANTS WITH PREDOMINANTLY (90%) CHRONIC BACK AND NECK PAIN. AFTER SCREENING, THE PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO KUNDALINI YOGA, STRENGTH TRAINING OR EVIDENCE-BASED ADVICE. PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS SICKNESS ABSENTEEISM. SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE SICKNESS PRESENTEEISM, BACK AND NECK PAIN AND DISABILITY. SELF-REPORTED QUESTIONNAIRES AND SMS TEXT MESSAGES WERE COMPLETED AT BASELINE, 6 WEEKS, 6 AND 12 MONTHS. RESULTS: THE RESULTS DID NOT INDICATE THAT KUNDALINI YOGA AND STRENGTH TRAINING HAD ANY STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON THE PRIMARY OUTCOME COMPARED WITH EVIDENCE-BASED ADVICE. AN INTERACTION EFFECT WAS FOUND BETWEEN ADHERENCE TO RECOMMENDATIONS AND SICKNESS ABSENTEEISM, INDICATING LARGER SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS AMONG THE ADHERERS TO KUNDALINI YOGA VERSUS EVIDENCE-BASED ADVICE: RR = 0.47 (CI 0.30; 0.74, P = 0.001), STRENGTH TRAINING VERSUS EVIDENCE-BASED ADVICE: RR = 0.60 (CI 0.38; 0.96, P = 0.032). SOME SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE ALSO FOUND FOR THE SECONDARY OUTCOMES TO THE ADVANTAGE OF KUNDALINI YOGA AND STRENGTH TRAINING. CONCLUSIONS: GUIDED EXERCISE IN THE FORMS OF KUNDALINI YOGA OR STRENGTH TRAINING DOES NOT REDUCE SICKNESS ABSENTEEISM MORE THAN EVIDENCE-BASED ADVICE ALONE. HOWEVER, SECONDARY ANALYSES REVEAL THAT AMONG THOSE WHO PURSUE KUNDALINI YOGA OR STRENGTH TRAINING AT LEAST TWO TIMES A WEEK, A SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCTION IN SICKNESS ABSENTEEISM WAS FOUND. METHODS TO INCREASE ADHERENCE TO TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS SHOULD BE FURTHER DEVELOPED AND APPLIED IN EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS.

11  162  46 A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: RESULTS OF A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO CONDUCT A PILOT TRIAL OF YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (LBP) TO INFORM THE FEASIBILITY AND PRACTICALITY OF CONDUCTING A FULL-SCALE TRIAL IN THE UK; AND TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. DESIGN: A PRAGMATIC RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS UNDERTAKEN COMPARING YOGA TO USUAL CARE. PARTICIPANTS: TWENTY PARTICIPANTS WHO HAD PRESENTED TO THEIR GP WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN IN THE PREVIOUS 18 MONTHS WERE RECRUITED VIA GP RECORDS FROM ONE PRACTICE IN YORK, UK. INTERVENTIONS: TWENTY PATIENTS WERE RANDOMISED TO EITHER 12 WEEKLY 75-MIN SESSIONS OF SPECIALISED YOGA PLUS WRITTEN ADVICE, OR USUAL CARE PLUS WRITTEN ADVICE. ALLOCATION WAS 50/50. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: RECRUITMENT RATE, LEVELS OF INTERVENTION ATTENDANCE, AND LOSS TO FOLLOW-UP WERE THE MAIN NON-CLINICAL OUTCOMES. CHANGE AS MEASURED BY THE ROLAND AND MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE WAS THE PRIMARY CLINICAL OUTCOME. CHANGES IN THE ABERDEEN BACK PAIN SCALE, SF-12, EQ-5D, AND PAIN SELF-EFFICACY WERE SECONDARY CLINICAL OUTCOMES. DATA WERE COLLECTED VIA POSTAL QUESTIONNAIRE AT BASELINE, 4 WEEKS, AND 12 WEEKS FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: OF THE 286 PATIENTS IDENTIFIED FROM THE GP DATABASE, 52 (18%) CONSENTED AND RETURNED THE ELIGIBILITY QUESTIONNAIRE, OUT OF THESE 20 (6.9%) WERE ELIGIBLE AND RANDOMISED. THE TOTAL PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS RANDOMISED FROM THE GP PRACTICE POPULATION WAS 0.28%. TEN PATIENTS WERE RANDOMISED TO YOGA, RECEIVING AN AVERAGE OF 1.7 SESSIONS (RANGE 0-5), AND 10 WERE RANDOMISED TO USUAL CARE. AT 12 WEEKS FOLLOW-UP DATA WAS RECEIVED FROM 60% OF PATIENTS IN THE YOGA GROUP AND 90% OF PATIENTS IN THE USUAL CARE GROUP (75% OVERALL). NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE SEEN BETWEEN GROUPS IN CLINICAL OUTCOMES APART FROM ON THE ABERDEEN BACK PAIN SCALE AT FOUR WEEKS FOLLOW-UP WHERE THE YOGA GROUP REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY LESS PAIN. CONCLUSION: THIS PILOT STUDY PROVIDED USEFUL DATA AND INFORMATION TO INFORM THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF A FULL-SCALE TRIAL OF YOGA FOR CLBP IN THE UK. A KEY FINDING IS THE CALCULATION OF GP PRACTICE TOTAL LIST SIZE REQUIRED FOR PATIENT RECRUITMENT IN A FULL-SCALE TRIAL, AND THE NEED TO IMPLEMENT METHODS TO INCREASE CLASS ATTENDANCE.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
12 1699  47 PARTICIPANT CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH SYMPTOMATIC IMPROVEMENT FROM YOGA FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. CONTEXT: STUDIES SUGGEST THAT YOGA IS EFFECTIVE FOR MODERATE TO SEVERE CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) IN DIVERSE PREDOMINANTLY LOWER SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS POPULATIONS. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH BENEFIT FROM THE YOGA INTERVENTION. OBJECTIVE: IDENTIFY FACTORS AT BASELINE INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER EFFICACY AMONG PARTICIPANTS IN A STUDY OF YOGA FOR CLBP. DESIGN: FROM SEPTEMBER-DECEMBER 2011, A 12-WEEK RANDOMIZED DOSING TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED COMPARING WEEKLY VS. TWICE-WEEKLY 75-MINUTE HATHA YOGA CLASSES FOR 95 PREDOMINANTLY LOW-INCOME MINORITY ADULTS WITH NONSPECIFIC CLBP. PARTICIPANT CHARACTERISTICS COLLECTED AT BASELINE WERE USED TO DETERMINE FACTORS BEYOND TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT (REPORTED IN THE INITIAL STUDY) THAT PREDICTED OUTCOME. WE USED BIVARIATE TESTING TO IDENTIFY BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENT IN FUNCTION AND PAIN, AND INCLUDED SELECT FACTORS IN A MULTIVARIATE LINEAR REGRESSION. SETTING: RECRUITMENT AND CLASSES OCCURRED IN AN ACADEMIC SAFETY-NET HOSPITAL AND FIVE AFFILIATED COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS IN BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS. PARTICIPANTS: NINETY-FIVE ADULTS WITH NONSPECIFIC CLBP, AGES RANGING FROM 20-64 (MEAN 48) YEARS; 72 WOMEN AND 23 MEN. OUTCOME MEASURES: PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE CHANGES IN BACK-RELATED FUNCTION (MODIFIED ROLAND-MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE, RMDQ; 0-23) AND MEAN LOW BACK PAIN INTENSITY (0-10) IN THE PREVIOUS WEEK, FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 12. RESULTS: ADJUSTING FOR GROUP ASSIGNMENT, BASELINE RMDQ, AGE, AND GENDER, FOREIGN NATIONALITY AND LOWER BASELINE SF36 PHYSICAL COMPONENT SCORE (PCS) WERE INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENT IN RMDQ. GREATER THAN HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION LEVEL, CLBP LESS THAN 1 YEAR, AND LOWER BASELINE SF36 PCS WERE INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENT IN PAIN INTENSITY. OTHER DEMOGRAPHICS INCLUDING RACE, INCOME, GENDER, BMI, AND USE OF PAIN MEDICATIONS WERE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH EITHER OUTCOME. CONCLUSIONS: POOR PHYSICAL HEALTH AT BASELINE IS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER IMPROVEMENT FROM YOGA IN BACK-RELATED FUNCTION AND PAIN. RACE, INCOME, AND BODY MASS INDEX DO NOT AFFECT THE POTENTIAL FOR A PERSON WITH LOW BACK PAIN TO EXPERIENCE BENEFIT FROM YOGA.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
13 2596  46 YOGA FOR MILITARY VETERANS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) IS PREVALENT, ESPECIALLY AMONG MILITARY VETERANS. MANY CLBP TREATMENT OPTIONS HAVE LIMITED BENEFITS AND ARE ACCOMPANIED BY SIDE EFFECTS. MAJOR EFFORTS TO REDUCE OPIOID USE AND EMBRACE NONPHARMACOLOGICAL PAIN TREATMENTS HAVE RESULTED. RESEARCH WITH COMMUNITY CLBP PATIENTS INDICATES THAT YOGA CAN IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND HAS FEW SIDE EFFECTS. THE BENEFITS OF YOGA AMONG MILITARY VETERANS WERE EXAMINED. DESIGN: PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER YOGA OR DELAYED YOGA TREATMENT IN 2013-2015. OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE, 6 WEEKS, 12 WEEKS, AND 6 MONTHS. INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSES OCCURRED IN 2016. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILITARY VETERANS WITH CLBP WERE RECRUITED FROM A MAJOR VETERANS AFFAIRS MEDICAL CENTER IN CALIFORNIA. INTERVENTION: YOGA CLASSES (WITH HOME PRACTICE) WERE LED BY A CERTIFIED INSTRUCTOR TWICE WEEKLY FOR 12 WEEKS, AND CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF PHYSICAL POSTURES, MOVEMENT, AND BREATHING TECHNIQUES. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS ROLAND-MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE SCORES AFTER 12 WEEKS. PAIN INTENSITY WAS IDENTIFIED AS AN IMPORTANT SECONDARY OUTCOME. RESULTS: PARTICIPANT CHARACTERISTICS WERE MEAN AGE 53 YEARS, 26% WERE FEMALE, 35% WERE UNEMPLOYED OR DISABLED, AND MEAN BACK PAIN DURATION WAS 15 YEARS. IMPROVEMENTS IN ROLAND-MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE SCORES DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS AT 12 WEEKS, BUT YOGA PARTICIPANTS HAD GREATER REDUCTIONS IN ROLAND-MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE SCORES THAN DELAYED TREATMENT PARTICIPANTS AT 6 MONTHS -2.48 (95% CI= -4.08, -0.87). YOGA PARTICIPANTS IMPROVED MORE ON PAIN INTENSITY AT 12 WEEKS AND AT 6 MONTHS. OPIOID MEDICATION USE DECLINED AMONG ALL PARTICIPANTS, BUT GROUP DIFFERENCES WERE NOT FOUND. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA IMPROVED HEALTH OUTCOMES AMONG VETERANS DESPITE EVIDENCE THEY HAD FEWER RESOURCES, WORSE HEALTH, AND MORE CHALLENGES ATTENDING YOGA SESSIONS THAN COMMUNITY SAMPLES STUDIED PREVIOUSLY. THE MAGNITUDE OF PAIN INTENSITY DECLINE WAS SMALL, BUT OCCURRED IN THE CONTEXT OF REDUCED OPIOID USE. THE FINDINGS SUPPORT WIDER IMPLEMENTATION OF YOGA PROGRAMS FOR VETERANS.

14 2852  49 YOGA, PHYSICAL THERAPY, OR EDUCATION FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: A RANDOMIZED NONINFERIORITY TRIAL. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS EFFECTIVE FOR MILD TO MODERATE CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP), BUT ITS COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS WITH PHYSICAL THERAPY (PT) IS UNKNOWN. MOREOVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT YOGA'S EFFECTIVENESS IN UNDERSERVED PATIENTS WITH MORE SEVERE FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY AND PAIN. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOGA IS NONINFERIOR TO PT FOR CLBP. DESIGN: 12-WEEK, SINGLE-BLIND, 3-GROUP RANDOMIZED NONINFERIORITY TRIAL AND SUBSEQUENT 40-WEEK MAINTENANCE PHASE. (CLINICALTRIALS.GOV: NCT01343927). SETTING: ACADEMIC SAFETY-NET HOSPITAL AND 7 AFFILIATED COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS. PARTICIPANTS: 320 PREDOMINANTLY LOW-INCOME, RACIALLY DIVERSE ADULTS WITH NONSPECIFIC CLBP. INTERVENTION: PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED 12 WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES, 15 PT VISITS, OR AN EDUCATIONAL BOOK AND NEWSLETTERS. THE MAINTENANCE PHASE COMPARED YOGA DROP-IN CLASSES VERSUS HOME PRACTICE AND PT BOOSTER SESSIONS VERSUS HOME PRACTICE. MEASUREMENTS: PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE BACK-RELATED FUNCTION, MEASURED BY THE ROLAND MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE (RMDQ), AND PAIN, MEASURED BY AN 11-POINT SCALE, AT 12 WEEKS. PRESPECIFIED NONINFERIORITY MARGINS WERE 1.5 (RMDQ) AND 1.0 (PAIN). SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED PAIN MEDICATION USE, GLOBAL IMPROVEMENT, SATISFACTION WITH INTERVENTION, AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE. RESULTS: ONE-SIDED 95% LOWER CONFIDENCE LIMITS WERE 0.83 (RMDQ) AND 0.97 (PAIN), DEMONSTRATING NONINFERIORITY OF YOGA TO PT. HOWEVER, YOGA WAS NOT SUPERIOR TO EDUCATION FOR EITHER OUTCOME. YOGA AND PT WERE SIMILAR FOR MOST SECONDARY OUTCOMES. YOGA AND PT PARTICIPANTS WERE 21 AND 22 PERCENTAGE POINTS LESS LIKELY, RESPECTIVELY, THAN EDUCATION PARTICIPANTS TO USE PAIN MEDICATION AT 12 WEEKS. IMPROVEMENTS IN YOGA AND PT GROUPS WERE MAINTAINED AT 1 YEAR WITH NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MAINTENANCE STRATEGIES. FREQUENCY OF ADVERSE EVENTS, MOSTLY MILD SELF-LIMITED JOINT AND BACK PAIN, DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN THE YOGA AND PT GROUPS. LIMITATIONS: PARTICIPANTS WERE NOT BLINDED TO TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT. THE PT GROUP HAD DISPROPORTIONATE LOSS TO FOLLOW-UP. CONCLUSION: A MANUALIZED YOGA PROGRAM FOR NONSPECIFIC CLBP WAS NONINFERIOR TO PT FOR FUNCTION AND PAIN.

15  521  44 COMPARING YOGA, EXERCISE, AND A SELF-CARE BOOK FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN IS A COMMON PROBLEM THAT HAS ONLY MODESTLY EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOGA IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN CONVENTIONAL THERAPEUTIC EXERCISE OR A SELF-CARE BOOK FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. DESIGN: RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: A NONPROFIT, INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. PATIENTS: 101 ADULTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. INTERVENTION: 12-WEEK SESSIONS OF YOGA OR CONVENTIONAL THERAPEUTIC EXERCISE CLASSES OR A SELF-CARE BOOK. MEASUREMENTS: PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE BACK-RELATED FUNCTIONAL STATUS (MODIFIED 24-POINT ROLAND DISABILITY SCALE) AND "BOTHERSOMENESS" OF PAIN (11-POINT NUMERICAL SCALE). THE PRIMARY TIME POINT WAS 12 WEEKS. CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE WAS CONSIDERED TO BE 2.5 POINTS ON THE FUNCTIONAL STATUS SCALE AND 1.5 POINTS ON THE BOTHERSOMENESS SCALE. SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE DAYS OF RESTRICTED ACTIVITY, GENERAL HEALTH STATUS, AND MEDICATION USE. RESULTS: AFTER ADJUSTMENT FOR BASELINE VALUES, BACK-RELATED FUNCTION IN THE YOGA GROUP WAS SUPERIOR TO THE BOOK AND EXERCISE GROUPS AT 12 WEEKS (YOGA VS. BOOK: MEAN DIFFERENCE, -3.4 [95% CI, -5.1 TO - 1.6] [P < 0.001]; YOGA VS. EXERCISE: MEAN DIFFERENCE, -1.8 [CI, -3.5 TO - 0.1] [P = 0.034]). NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN SYMPTOM BOTHERSOMENESS WERE FOUND BETWEEN ANY 2 GROUPS AT 12 WEEKS; AT 26 WEEKS, THE YOGA GROUP WAS SUPERIOR TO THE BOOK GROUP WITH RESPECT TO THIS MEASURE (MEAN DIFFERENCE, -2.2 [CI, -3.2 TO - 1.2]; P < 0.001). AT 26 WEEKS, BACK-RELATED FUNCTION IN THE YOGA GROUP WAS SUPERIOR TO THE BOOK GROUP (MEAN DIFFERENCE, -3.6 [CI, -5.4 TO - 1.8]; P < 0.001). LIMITATIONS: PARTICIPANTS IN THIS STUDY WERE FOLLOWED FOR ONLY 26 WEEKS AFTER RANDOMIZATION. ONLY 1 INSTRUCTOR DELIVERED EACH INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA WAS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN A SELF-CARE BOOK FOR IMPROVING FUNCTION AND REDUCING CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN, AND THE BENEFITS PERSISTED FOR AT LEAST SEVERAL MONTHS.	2005	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
16 1682  58 ONLINE YOGA IN MYELOPROLIFERATIVE NEOPLASM PATIENTS: RESULTS OF A RANDOMIZED PILOT TRIAL TO INFORM FUTURE RESEARCH. BACKGROUND: MYELOPROLIFERATIVE NEOPLASM (MPN) PATIENTS SUFFER FROM SIGNIFICANT SYMPTOMS, INFLAMMATION AND REDUCED QUALITY OF LIFE. YOGA IMPROVES THESE OUTCOMES IN OTHER CANCERS, BUT THIS HASN'T BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN MPNS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO: (1) EXPLORE THE LIMITED EFFICACY (DOES THE PROGRAM SHOW PROMISE OF SUCCESS) OF A 12-WEEK ONLINE YOGA INTERVENTION AMONG MPN PATIENTS ON SYMPTOM BURDEN AND QUALITY OF LIFE AND (2) DETERMINE FEASIBILITY (PRACTICALITY: TO WHAT EXTENT A MEASURE CAN BE CARRIED OUT) OF REMOTELY COLLECTING INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS. METHODS: PATIENTS WERE RECRUITED NATIONALLY AND RANDOMIZED TO ONLINE YOGA (60 MIN/WEEK OF YOGA) OR WAIT-LIST CONTROL (ASKED TO MAINTAIN NORMAL ACTIVITY). WEEKLY YOGA MINUTES WERE COLLECTED WITH CLICKY (ONLINE WEB ANALYTICS TOOL) AND SELF-REPORT. THOSE IN ONLINE YOGA COMPLETED A BLOOD DRAW AT BASELINE AND WEEK 12 TO ASSESS INFLAMMATION (INTERLEUKIN-6, TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR-ALPHA [TNF-ALPHA]). ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES ASSESSING DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, FATIGUE, PAIN, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, SEXUAL FUNCTION, TOTAL SYMPTOM BURDEN, GLOBAL HEALTH, AND QUALITY OF LIFE AT BASELINE, WEEK SEVEN, 12, AND 16. CHANGE FROM BASELINE AT EACH TIME POINT WAS COMPUTED BY GROUP AND EFFECT SIZES WERE CALCULATED. PRE-POST INTERVENTION CHANGE IN INFLAMMATION FOR THE YOGA GROUP WAS COMPARED BY T-TEST. RESULTS: SIXTY-TWO MPN PATIENTS ENROLLED AND 48 COMPLETED THE INTERVENTION (ONLINE YOGA = 27; CONTROL GROUP = 21). YOGA PARTICIPATION AVERAGED 40.8 MIN/WEEK VIA CLICKY AND 56.1 MIN/WEEK VIA SELF-REPORT. SMALL/MODERATE EFFECT SIZES WERE GENERATED FROM THE YOGA INTERVENTION FOR SLEEP DISTURBANCE (D = - 0.26 TO - 0.61), PAIN INTENSITY (D = - 0.34 TO - 0.51), ANXIETY (D = - 0.27 TO - 0.37), AND DEPRESSION (D = - 0.53 TO - 0.78). A TOTAL OF 92.6 AND 70.4% OF ONLINE YOGA PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE BLOOD DRAW AT BASELINE AND WEEK 12, RESPECTIVELY, AND THERE WAS A DECREASE IN TNF-ALPHA FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 12 (- 1.3 +/- 1.5 PG/ML). CONCLUSIONS: ONLINE YOGA DEMONSTRATED SMALL EFFECTS ON SLEEP, PAIN, AND ANXIETY AS WELL AS A MODERATE EFFECT ON DEPRESSION. REMOTE BLOOD DRAW PROCEDURES ARE FEASIBLE AND THE EFFECT SIZE OF THE INTERVENTION ON TNF-ALPHA WAS LARGE. FUTURE FULLY POWERED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS ARE NEEDED TO TEST FOR EFFICACY.

17 1771  31 POTENTIAL ROLE OF YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS: A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY. BACKGROUND: ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS (AS) IS A CHRONIC AUTOIMMUNE INFLAMMATORY SPONDYLOARTHROPATHY WITH UNCLEAR PATHOGENESIS. THE INFLAMMATORY PAIN IN AS LEADS TO RESTRICTED SPINAL MOBILITY AND SIGNIFICANT DISABILITY. YOGA IS A NONPHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION THAT HAS POSITIVE EFFECTS ON VARIOUS MUSCULOSKELETAL-RELATED PROBLEMS. HOWEVER, ITS ROLE IN AS IS UNKNOWN. OBJECTIVE: THE PRESENT RETROSPECTIVE STUDY ASSESSED THE EFFICACY OF A TWO-WEEK RESIDENTIAL YOGA INTERVENTION ON SPINAL FLEXIBILITY AMONG AS PATIENTS. METHODS: THE RECORDS FOR 24 MALE AS PATIENTS WITHIN THE AGE RANGE 30 TO 50 YEARS (AVERAGE AGE 38.3 +/- 10.5 YEARS) WHO UNDERWENT A TWO-WEEK RESIDENTIAL YOGA RETREAT BETWEEN 2015 AND 2020 WERE OBTAINED FROM A YOGA CENTER LOCATED IN SOUTH INDIA. YOGA INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF YOGA POSTURES, BREATHING PRACTICES, MEDITATION, A HEALTHY DIET, AND DEVOTIONAL SESSIONS. PRE AND POST DATA OF THE SIT-AND-REACH TEST, BLOOD PRESSURE, HEART RATE, AND SYMPTOM SCORE WERE ANALYZED USING STATISTICAL PACKAGE FOR SOCIAL SCIENCES (SPSS). RESULTS: COMPARED TO THE BASELINE, THE POST SCORES OF THE SIT-AND-REACH TEST, SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEART RATE WERE FOUND TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY (P < .05) LOWER. THE SYMPTOM SCORE AND ANALGESIC MEDICATION SCORE ALSO SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT AFTER TWO-WEEKS COMPARED TO THE BASELINE. CONCLUSION: THIS RETROSPECTIVE STUDY INDICATES THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF ON AND ANALGESIC USE AMONG AS PATIENTS. HOWEVER, ADDITIONAL STUDIES USING ROBUST RESEARCH DESIGNS ARE WARRANTED.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
18 2558  52 YOGA FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN IN A PREDOMINANTLY MINORITY POPULATION: A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: SEVERAL STUDIES SUGGEST YOGA MAY BE EFFECTIVE FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN; HOWEVER, TRIALS TARGETING MINORITIES HAVE NOT BEEN CONDUCTED. PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVES: ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF STUDYING YOGA IN A PREDOMINANTLY MINORITY POPULATION WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. COLLECT PRELIMINARY DATA TO PLAN A LARGER POWERED STUDY. STUDY DESIGN: PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: TWO COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS IN A RACIALLY DIVERSE NEIGHBORHOOD OF BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS. PARTICIPANTS: THIRTY ENGLISH-SPEAKING ADULTS (MEAN AGE 44 YEARS, 83% FEMALE, 83% RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES; 48% WITH INCOMES < OR = $30,000) WITH MODERATE-TO-SEVERE CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. INTERVENTIONS: STANDARDIZED SERIES OF WEEKLY HATHA YOGA CLASSES FOR 12 WEEKS COMPARED TO A WAITLIST USUAL CARE CONTROL. OUTCOME MEASURES: FEASIBILITY MEASURED BY TIME TO COMPLETE ENROLLMENT, PROPORTION OF RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES ENROLLED, RETENTION RATES, AND ADVERSE EVENTS. PRIMARY EFFICACY OUTCOMES WERE CHANGES FROM BASELINE TO 12 WEEKS IN PAIN SCORE (0=NO PAIN TO 10=WORST POSSIBLE PAIN) AND BACK-RELATED FUNCTION USING THE MODIFIED ROLAND-MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE (0-23 POINT SCALE, HIGHER SCORES REFLECT POORER FUNCTION). SECONDARY EFFICACY OUTCOMES WERE ANALGESIC USE, GLOBAL IMPROVEMENT, AND QUALITY OF LIFE (SF-36). RESULTS: RECRUITMENT TOOK 2 MONTHS. RETENTION RATES WERE 97% AT 12 WEEKS AND 77% AT 26 WEEKS. MEAN PAIN SCORES FOR YOGA DECREASED FROM BASELINE TO 12 WEEKS (6.7 TO 4.4) COMPARED TO USUAL CARE, WHICH DECREASED FROM 7.5 TO 7.1 (P=.02). MEAN ROLAND SCORES FOR YOGA DECREASED FROM 14.5 TO 8.2 COMPARED TO USUAL CARE, WHICH DECREASED FROM 16.1 TO 12.5 (P=.28). AT 12 WEEKS, YOGA COMPARED TO USUAL CARE PARTICIPANTS REPORTED LESS ANALGESIC USE (13% VS 73%, P=.003), LESS OPIATE USE (0% VS 33%, P=.04), AND GREATER OVERALL IMPROVEMENT (73% VS 27%, P=.03). THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES IN SF-36 SCORES AND NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS. CONCLUSION: A YOGA STUDY INTERVENTION IN A PREDOMINANTLY MINORITY POPULATION WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN WAS MODERATELY FEASIBLE AND MAY BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN USUAL CARE FOR REDUCING PAIN AND PAIN MEDICATION USE.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
19 2824  57 YOGA VERSUS EDUCATION FOR VETERANS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: STUDY PROTOCOL FOR A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN IS THE MOST FREQUENT PAIN CONDITION IN VETERANS AND CAUSES SUBSTANTIAL SUFFERING, DECREASED FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY, AND LOWER QUALITY OF LIFE. SYMPTOMS OF POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS, DEPRESSION, AND MILD TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY ARE HIGHLY PREVALENT IN VETERANS WITH BACK PAIN. YOGA FOR LOW BACK PAIN HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR CIVILIANS IN RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. HOWEVER, IT IS UNKNOWN IF RESULTS FROM PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED TRIALS GENERALIZE TO MILITARY POPULATIONS. METHODS/DESIGN: THIS STUDY IS A PARALLEL RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING YOGA TO EDUCATION FOR 120 VETERANS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. PARTICIPANTS ARE VETERANS >/=18 YEARS OLD WITH LOW BACK PAIN PRESENT ON AT LEAST HALF THE DAYS IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS AND A SELF-REPORTED AVERAGE PAIN INTENSITY IN THE PREVIOUS WEEK OF >/=4 ON A 0-10 SCALE. THE 24-WEEK STUDY HAS AN INITIAL 12-WEEK INTERVENTION PERIOD, WHERE PARTICIPANTS ARE RANDOMIZED EQUALLY INTO (1) A STANDARDIZED WEEKLY GROUP YOGA CLASS WITH HOME PRACTICE OR (2) EDUCATION DELIVERED WITH A SELF-CARE BOOK. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES ARE CHANGE AT 12 WEEKS IN LOW BACK PAIN INTENSITY MEASURED BY THE DEFENSE AND VETERANS PAIN RATING SCALE (0-10) AND BACK-RELATED FUNCTION USING THE 23-POINT ROLAND MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE. IN THE SUBSEQUENT 12-WEEK FOLLOW-UP PERIOD, YOGA PARTICIPANTS ARE ENCOURAGED TO CONTINUE HOME YOGA PRACTICE AND EDUCATION PARTICIPANTS CONTINUE FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE BOOK. QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WITH VETERANS IN THE YOGA GROUP AND THEIR PARTNERS EXPLORE THE IMPACT OF CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN AND YOGA ON FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS. WE ALSO ASSESS COST-EFFECTIVENESS FROM THREE PERSPECTIVES: THE VETERAN, THE VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION, AND SOCIETY USING ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS, SELF-REPORTED COST DATA, AND STUDY RECORDS. DISCUSSION: THIS STUDY WILL HELP DETERMINE IF YOGA CAN BECOME AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR VETERANS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL COMORBIDITIES.

20  668  48 EFFECT OF A 16-WEEK BIKRAM YOGA PROGRAM ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY AND ASSOCIATED CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK FACTORS IN STRESSED AND SEDENTARY ADULTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC ACTIVATION OF THE STRESS-RESPONSE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK, PARTICULARLY IN SEDENTARY INDIVIDUALS. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECT OF A BIKRAM YOGA INTERVENTION ON THE HIGH FREQUENCY POWER COMPONENT OF HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) AND ASSOCIATED CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (CVD) RISK FACTORS (I.E. ADDITIONAL DOMAINS OF HRV, HEMODYNAMIC, HEMATOLOGIC, ANTHROPOMETRIC AND BODY COMPOSITION OUTCOME MEASURES) IN STRESSED AND SEDENTARY ADULTS. METHODS: ELIGIBLE ADULTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO AN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (N = 29) OR A NO TREATMENT CONTROL GROUP (N = 34). EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PARTICIPANTS WERE INSTRUCTED TO ATTEND THREE TO FIVE SUPERVISED BIKRAM YOGA CLASSES PER WEEK FOR 16 WEEKS AT LOCAL STUDIOS. OUTCOME MEASURES WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE (WEEK 0) AND COMPLETION (WEEK 17). RESULTS: SIXTY-THREE ADULTS (37.2 +/- 10.8 YEARS, 79% WOMEN) WERE INCLUDED IN THE INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP ATTENDED 27 +/- 18 CLASSES. ANALYSES OF COVARIANCE REVEALED NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE HIGH-FREQUENCY COMPONENT OF HRV (P = 0.912, PARTIAL ETA (2) = 0.000) OR IN ANY SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE BETWEEN GROUPS OVER TIME. HOWEVER, REGRESSION ANALYSES REVEALED THAT HIGHER ATTENDANCE IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (P = 0.039; PARTIAL ETA (2) = 0.154), BODY FAT PERCENTAGE (P = 0.001, PARTIAL ETA (2) = 0.379), FAT MASS (P = 0.003, PARTIAL ETA (2) = 0.294) AND BODY MASS INDEX (P = 0.05, PARTIAL ETA (2) = 0.139). CONCLUSIONS: A 16-WEEK BIKRAM YOGA PROGRAM DID NOT INCREASE THE HIGH FREQUENCY POWER COMPONENT OF HRV OR ANY OTHER CVD RISK FACTORS INVESTIGATED. AS REVEALED BY POST HOC ANALYSES, LOW ADHERENCE LIKELY CONTRIBUTED TO THE NULL EFFECTS. FUTURE STUDIES ARE REQUIRED TO ADDRESS BARRIERS TO ADHERENCE TO BETTER ELUCIDATE THE DOSE-RESPONSE EFFECTS OF BIKRAM YOGA PRACTICE AS A MEDIUM TO LOWER STRESS-RELATED CVD RISK.

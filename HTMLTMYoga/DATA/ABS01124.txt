1 1124 123 EFFICACY OF PRENATAL YOGA IN THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY DURING PREGNANCY: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. WOMEN COMMONLY SUFFER FROM DEPRESSION DURING PREGNANCY. FOR REDUCING DEPRESSION, YOGA SEEMS TO BE MORE SUITABLE FOR PREGNANT WOMEN THAN OTHER PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES BECAUSE OF ITS LOW EXERCISE INTENSITY. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF PRENATAL YOGA ON THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION DURING PREGNANCY. THREE ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR RELEVANT ARTICLES FROM THEIR INCEPTION TO MAY 2021, INCLUDING PUBMED, COCHRANE LIBRARY, AND SCIENCEDIRECT. PRE- AND POST-TEST OUTCOMES WERE ADOPTED TO ESTIMATE STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE WITH A 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL FOR ASSESSING THE EFFICACY OF YOGA. HETEROGENEITY AMONG ARTICLES WAS DETECTED USING I(2) VALUE. A TOTAL OF 13 ARTICLES THAT CONTAINED 379 SUBJECTS WERE INCLUDED FOR META-ANALYSIS. NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN DEPRESSION SCORES AFTER PRACTICING YOGA WAS OBSERVED FOR WOMEN WITHOUT DEPRESSION (P = 0.09) BUT SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT WAS OBSERVED FOR WOMEN WITH DEPRESSION (P = 0.001). ALTHOUGH SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ANXIETY SCORES AFTER YOGA WAS OBSERVED FOR WOMEN WITHOUT DEPRESSION (P = 0.02), THE RESULTS OF THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS WERE NOT CONSISTENT, WHILE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ANXIETY SCORES AFTER YOGA WAS ALSO OBSERVED FOR WOMEN WITH DEPRESSION (P &LT; 0.00001). THE CURRENT EVIDENCE HAS SUGGESTED THAT YOGA HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SCORES IN PREGNANT WOMEN WITH DEPRESSION. HOWEVER, THE LEVEL OF EVIDENCE OF THIS STUDY WAS NOT HIGH. MORE ARTICLES WITH HIGH LEVELS OF EVIDENCE SHOULD BE CONDUCTED TO CONFIRM OUR CONCLUSION IN THE FUTURE.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
2  559  47 COULD YOGA PRACTICE IMPROVE TREATMENT-RELATED SIDE EFFECTS AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER? A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. AIM: TO DETERMINE IF YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPY WAS ASSOCIATED WITH ENHANCED HEALTH AND TREATMENT-RELATED SIDE EFFECTS IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW EXAMINES WHETHER YOGA PRACTICE PROVIDES ANY MEASURABLE BENEFIT, BOTH PHYSICALLY AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY, FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER. METHODS: PUBMED, EMBASE AND THE COCHRANE LIBRARY FOR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) THROUGHOUT JUNE 2013. WE EVALUATED THE QUALITY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES BY THE COCHRANE HANDBOOK 5.2 STANDARDS AND ANALYZED THE DATA USING THE STATA SOFTWARE, VERSION 10.0. META-REGRESSION AND SUBGROUP ANALYSIS WERE ALSO PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL PREDICTORS OF OUTCOME AND TO ASSESS HETEROGENEITY. RESULTS: SIXTEEN RCTS WITH A TOTAL OF 930 PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED. COMPARING YOGA GROUPS TO CONTROL GROUPS, THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN OVERALL HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY AND GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS. META-REGRESSION ANALYSES REVEALED THAT THE DURATION OF YOGA PRACTICE AND TYPE OF CONTROL GROUP PARTLY EXPLAINED THE HETEROGENEITY. SUBGROUP ANALYSES REVEALED THAT YOGA HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON ANXIETY ONLY WHEN IT HAD BEEN PRACTICED FOR LONGER THAN 3 MONTHS. ONLY THE WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP SHOWED AN EFFECT OF YOGA ON PHYSICAL WELL-BEING. CONCLUSION: THE CURRENT EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATES THAT YOGA PRACTICE COULD BE EFFECTIVE IN ENHANCING HEALTH AND MANAGING SOME TREATMENT-RELATED SIDE EFFECTS FOR PATIENTS RECOVERING FROM BREAST CANCER. IN FUTURE CLINICAL STUDIES, CLINICIANS SHOULD CONSIDER THE PATIENT'S WISHES ALONG WITH THE CURRENT BEST EVIDENCE OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA PRACTICE IN THEIR CLINICAL DECISION-MAKING.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
3 1079  32 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND PHYSICAL HEALTH OF PATIENTS WITH CANCER: A META-ANALYSIS. YOGA IS ONE OF THE MOST WIDELY USED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE THERAPIES TO MANAGE ILLNESS. THIS META-ANALYSIS AIMED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND PHYSICAL HEALTH OF PATIENTS WITH CANCER. STUDIES WERE IDENTIFIED THROUGH A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH OF SEVEN ELECTRONIC DATABASES AND WERE SELECTED IF THEY USED A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL DESIGN TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER. THE QUALITY OF EACH ARTICLE WAS RATED BY TWO OF THE AUTHORS USING THE PEDRO SCALE. TEN ARTICLES WERE SELECTED; THEIR PEDRO SCORES RANGED FROM 4 TO 7. THE YOGA GROUPS COMPARED TO WAITLIST CONTROL GROUPS OR SUPPORTIVE THERAPY GROUPS SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH: ANXIETY (P = .009), DEPRESSION (P = .002), DISTRESS (P = .003), AND STRESS (P = .006). HOWEVER, DUE TO THE MIXED AND LOW TO FAIR QUALITY AND SMALL NUMBER OF STUDIES CONDUCTED, THE FINDINGS ARE PRELIMINARY AND LIMITED AND SHOULD BE CONFIRMED THROUGH HIGHER-QUALITY, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
4 2899  50 [EFFECTS OF PRENATAL YOGA: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS]. OBJECTIVES: WHILE SEVERAL STUDIES ON THE PREVENTIVE AND THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF PRENATAL YOGA (MATERNITY YOGA) HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN NO SYSTEMATIC REVIEW ON THE EFFECTS OF PRENATAL YOGA BASED ON RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCT). THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY, THEREFORE, WAS TO SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEW THE LITERATURE TO CLARIFY THE EFFECTS OF PRENATAL YOGA IN RCT FOCUSING ON THE CONTENTS OF THE INTERVENTION, THE INTERVENTION MEANS, AND THE FREQUENCY OF PRACTICE. METHODS: THE LITERATURE SEARCH WAS PERFORMED USING THE ELECTRONIC DATABASE, PUBMED. THE INCLUSION CRITERIA WERE RCT, PREGNANT WOMEN, AND YOGA INTERVENTION. RESULTS: IN TOTAL, 54 CITATIONS WERE FOUND; OF THESE, EIGHT STUDIES (10 REPORTS) WERE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS. IN FOUR STUDIES ON HEALTHY PREGNANT WOMEN, SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PAIN AND PLEASURE AT DELIVERY, DURATION OF DELIVERY, PERCEIVED STRESS LEVELS DURING PREGNANCY, ANXIETY LEVELS, DEPRESSION, PREGNANCY-RELATED EXPERIENCES, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS WERE COMPARED TO THOSE IN THE CONTROL GROUP. IN TWO STUDIES ON DEPRESSED PREGNANT WOMEN, ONE REPORTED THAT DEPRESSION, ANXIETY LEVELS, ANGER LEVELS, LEG PAIN, AND BACK PAIN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED WITH YOGA, WHILE THE OTHER FOUND NO DIFFERENCES FROM THE CONTROL GROUP. IN ONE STUDY OF HIGH-RISK PREGNANT WOMEN WITH MORBIDITY FACTORS SUCH AS OBESITY OR ADVANCED AGE, YOGA RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER CASES OF PREGNANCY-INDUCED HYPERTENSION, GESTATIONAL DIABETES, AND INTRAUTERINE GROWTH RESTRICTION, AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN PERCEIVED STRESS LEVELS. IN ONE STUDY ON PREGNANT WOMEN WITH PELVIC PAIN, THE MEDIAN PAIN SCORE WAS LOWER IN THE YOGA GROUP. REGARDING THE CONTENTS OF THE INTERVENTION, WHILE THE TWO STUDIES FOR DEPRESSED PREGNANT WOMEN ONLY INCLUDED PHYSICAL POSTURES, THE REMAINING SIX STUDIES ALSO INCLUDED BREATHING TECHNIQUE AND MEDITATION. INTERVENTIONS WERE PERFORMED USING LECTURES BY INSTRUCTORS ALONE OR TOGETHER WITH SELF-TEACHING. THE FREQUENCY OF THE INTERVENTION VARIED WITHIN EACH STUDY. CONCLUSION: THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT PRENATAL YOGA MAY HELP REDUCE PELVIC PAIN. IT MAY ALSO IMPROVE MENTAL CONDITION (STRESS, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, ETC.), PHYSICAL CONDITION (PAIN AND PLEASURE AT THE DELIVERY, ETC.), AND PERINATAL OUTCOMES (OBSTETRICAL COMPLICATIONS, DELIVERY TIME, ETC.). HOWEVER, FURTHER STUDIES ARE NEEDED. THE CONTENTS OF THE INTERVENTION, THE INTERVENTION MEANS, AND THE FREQUENCY VARIED WITH EACH STUDY. THUS, IT IS NECESSARY TO FURTHER EXAMINE THE CONTENT OF EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS, INTERVENTION MEANS, AND FREQUENCY THAT SUIT PARTICIPANT'S CHARACTERISTICS AND EACH OUTCOME. FURTHER RESEARCH IN THIS FIELD, PARTICULARLY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS, IS MERITED.	2015	

5 1199  40 EXERCISE AND YOGA DURING PREGNANCY AND THEIR IMPACT ON DEPRESSION: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW. IT IS WELL ESTABLISHED THAT EXERCISE CAN IMPROVE DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IN THE GENERAL POPULATION; HOWEVER, IT IS NOT CLEAR IF THESE BENEFITS ARE ALSO SEEN IN PREGNANCY. THIS REVIEW AIMED TO SYNTHESIZE THE EVIDENCE THAT EXAMINES WHETHER EXERCISE DURING PREGNANCY IMPACTS DEPRESSIVE AND ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS (E.G. ANXIETY) DURING THE PERINATAL PERIOD. THE REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH PRISMA GUIDELINES AND REPORTING CRITERIA; LITERATURE WAS SEARCHED USING PUBMED, SCOPUS AND WEB OF SCIENCE DATABASE ENGINES. CLINICAL TRIALS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH EVALUATING THE EFFECTS OF A DEFINED EXERCISE PROTOCOL DURING PREGNANCY ON DEPRESSIVE AND/OR ANXIETY SYMPTOMS DURING THE PERINATAL PERIOD WERE INCLUDED. STUDIES WITHOUT A CONTROL GROUP WERE EXCLUDED. RISK OF BIAS WAS CONDUCTED BY COCHRANE ASSESSMENT TO APPRAISE THE QUALITY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES. TWENTY-SEVEN ARTICLES, BETWEEN 1994 AND 2019, WERE INCLUDED. OF THESE, ONLY 5 SPECIFICALLY RECRUITED WOMEN WITH DEPRESSION (N = 334), WHICH ALL ASSESSED A YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION; 4 OF THESE STUDIES SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN DEPRESSIVE AND/OR ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP COMPARED TO BASELINE; HOWEVER, 2 OF THESE STUDIES ALSO SHOWED AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE CONTROL GROUP. THE REMAINING 22 STUDIES USED VARIOUS EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS IN PREGNANT WOMEN (N = 4808) WITH 20 STUDIES REPORTING THAT EXERCISE DURING PREGNANCY HAS THE ABILITY TO IMPROVE DEPRESSIVE AND/OR ANXIETY MEASURES IN THE PERINATAL PERIOD COMPARED TO EITHER BASELINE OR CONTROL. THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT EXERCISE OF VARIOUS TYPES IN PREGNANCY CAN REDUCE DEPRESSIVE AND/OR ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IN THE PERINATAL PERIOD IN OTHERWISE HEALTHY WOMEN. SPECIFICALLY IN WOMEN WITH ANTENATAL DEPRESSION, THE INCORPORATION OF YOGA IN PREGNANCY CAN IMPROVE DEPRESSIVE/ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IN THE PERINATAL PERIOD; HOWEVER, THIS IS BASED ON A SMALL NUMBER OF STUDIES, AND IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER THIS IS SUPERIOR TO NON-EXERCISE CONTROLS. FURTHER STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF EXERCISE OF VARIOUS TYPES DURING PREGNANCY ON SYMPTOMS OF ANTENATAL DEPRESSION.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
6  698  43 EFFECT OF HATHA YOGA ON ANXIETY: A META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVE: SOME EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT HATHA YOGA MIGHT BE AN EFFECTIVE PRACTICE TO REDUCE ANXIETY. TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF HATHA YOGA ON ANXIETY, WE CONDUCTED A META-ANALYSIS OF RELEVANT STUDIES EXTRACTED FROM PUBMED, PSYCINFO, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, AND MANUAL SEARCHES. METHODS: THE SEARCH IDENTIFIED 17 STUDIES (11 WAITLIST CONTROLLED TRIALS) TOTALING 501 PARTICIPANTS WHO RECEIVED HATHA YOGA AND WHO REPORTED THEIR LEVELS OF ANXIETY BEFORE AND AFTER THE PRACTICE. WE ESTIMATED THE CONTROLLED AND WITHIN-GROUP RANDOM EFFECTS OF THE PRACTICE ON ANXIETY. RESULTS: THE PRE-POST WITHIN-GROUP AND CONTROLLED EFFECT SIZES WERE, HEDGES' G = 0.44 AND HEDGES' G = 0.61, RESPECTIVELY. TREATMENT EFFICACY WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS PRACTICED. PEOPLE WITH ELEVATED LEVELS OF ANXIETY BENEFITTED THE MOST. EFFECT SIZES WERE NOT MODERATED BY STUDY YEAR, GENDER, PRESENCE OF A MEDICAL DISORDER, OR AGE. ALTHOUGH THE QUALITY OF THE STUDIES WAS RELATIVELY LOW, THE RISK OF STUDY BIAS DID NOT MODERATE THE EFFECT. CONCLUSIONS: HATHA YOGA IS A PROMISING METHOD FOR TREATING ANXIETY. HOWEVER, MORE WELL-CONTROLLED STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO COMPARE THE EFFICACY OF HATHA YOGA WITH OTHER MORE ESTABLISHED TREATMENTS AND TO UNDERSTAND ITS MECHANISM. THIS ARTICLE IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT.

7 2566  46 YOGA FOR DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IN PEOPLE WITH CANCER: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVE: CANCER AND ITS TREATMENT CAN LEAD TO A VARIETY OF PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL CONCERNS IMPACTING ON THOSE AFFECTED, INCLUDING SUBCLINICAL OR CLINICAL DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, WHICH IN TURN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON WELLBEING, QUALITY OF LIFE AND SURVIVAL. THE AIM OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ON SELF-REPORTED DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IN PEOPLE WITH CANCER IN RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. METHOD: SIX DATABASES WERE SEARCHED TO IDENTIFY RELEVANT STUDIES. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW PROCEDURES WERE FOLLOWED INCLUDING A QUALITY ASSESSMENT. META-ANALYSIS OF SUITABLE STUDIES WAS CONDUCTED. RESULTS: 26 STUDIES FROM OUR SEARCH CRITERIA WERE ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION FOR DEPRESSIVE AND 16 FOR ANXIETY SYMPTOMS. META-ANALYSES REVEALED EVIDENCE FOR SIGNIFICANT MEDIUM EFFECTS OF YOGA ON DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS (N = 1,486, G = -0.419, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI] = -0.558 TO -0.281, P < 0.001) AND ANXIETY (N = 977, G = -0.347, 95% CI = -0.473 TO -0.221, P < 0.001) COMPARED TO CONTROLS. SUBGROUP ANALYSES FOR DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS REVEALED SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS FOR ALL ANALYSES PERFORMED (TYPE OF CANCER, TYPE OF CONTROL, TREATMENT STATUS, DURATION OF INTERVENTION OR FREQUENCY OF YOGA SESSIONS), WITH EFFECT SIZES BEING COMPARABLE BETWEEN SUBGROUPS. SIMILAR FINDINGS WERE FOUND FOR ANXIETY SYMPTOMS EXCEPT FOR TREATMENT STATUS, WHERE THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT WAS FOUND WHEN YOGA WAS DELIVERED DURING ACTIVE TREATMENT. CONCLUSIONS: THIS REVIEW PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT IN PEOPLE WITH CANCER, YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH AMELIORATION OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND THEREFORE A PROMISING THERAPEUTIC MODALITY FOR THEIR MANAGEMENT. HOWEVER, THE POTENTIAL FOR RISK OF BIAS TOGETHER WITH CONTROL GROUP DESIGN CHALLENGES MEANS THE RESULTS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
8 2488  33 YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR THE REDUCTION OF SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW IS TO EVALUATE THE IMPLEMENTATION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR THE REDUCTION OF SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION IN YOUTH. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THERE ARE NO SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS TO DATE LOOKING AT THE REDUCTION OF SYMPTOMS OF BOTH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. METHODS: NUMEROUS SCIENTIFIC DATABASES WERE SEARCHED UP TO NOVEMBER 2018 FOR EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES ASSESSING CHANGES IN SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AND/OR DEPRESSION IN YOUTHS FOLLOWING YOGA INTERVENTIONS. QUALITY AND LEVEL OF EVIDENCE WERE ASSESSED, AND INFORMATION WAS SYNTHESIZED ACROSS STUDIES. RESULTS: TWENTY-SEVEN STUDIES INVOLVING YOUTH WITH VARYING HEALTH STATUSES WERE REVIEWED. INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS VARIED GREATLY ACROSS STUDIES REVEALING MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT MAY IMPACT INTERVENTION EFFICACY, HOWEVER 70% OF THE STUDIES OVERALL SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS. FOR STUDIES ASSESSING ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, 58% SHOWED REDUCTIONS IN BOTH SYMPTOMS, WHILE 25% SHOWED REDUCTIONS IN ANXIETY ONLY. ADDITIONALLY, 70% OF STUDIES ASSESSING ANXIETY ALONE SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS AND 40% OF STUDIES ONLY ASSESSING DEPRESSION SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS. CONCLUSION: THE STUDIES REVIEWED, WHILE OF WEAK TO MODERATE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY, SHOWED THAT YOGA, DEFINED BY THE PRACTICE OF POSTURES, GENERALLY LEADS TO SOME REDUCTIONS IN ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION IN YOUTH REGARDLESS OF HEALTH STATUS AND INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
9 1740  43 PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA IN CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS, A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. BACKGROUND: THIS STUDY AIMED TO SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEW THE EVIDENCE FROM RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) AND TO CONDUCT A META-ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES IN CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS. METHODS: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE SEARCH IN TEN DATABASES WAS CONDUCTED IN NOVEMBER 2011. STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IF THEY HAD AN RCT DESIGN, FOCUSED ON CANCER PATIENTS OR SURVIVORS, INCLUDED PHYSICAL POSTURES IN THE YOGA PROGRAM, COMPARED YOGA WITH A NON-EXERCISE OR WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP, AND EVALUATED PHYSICAL AND/OR PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES. TWO RESEARCHERS INDEPENDENTLY RATED THE QUALITY OF THE INCLUDED RCTS, AND HIGH QUALITY WAS DEFINED AS >50% OF THE TOTAL POSSIBLE SCORE. EFFECT SIZES (COHEN'S D) WERE CALCULATED FOR OUTCOMES STUDIED IN MORE THAN THREE STUDIES AMONG PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER USING MEANS AND STANDARD DEVIATIONS OF POST-TEST SCORES OF THE INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS. RESULTS: SIXTEEN PUBLICATIONS OF 13 RCTS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA, OF WHICH ONE INCLUDED PATIENTS WITH LYMPHOMAS AND THE OTHERS FOCUSED ON PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. THE MEDIAN QUALITY SCORE WAS 67% (RANGE: 22-89%). THE INCLUDED STUDIES EVALUATED 23 PHYSICAL AND 20 PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES. OF THE OUTCOMES STUDIED IN MORE THAN THREE STUDIES AMONG PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER, WE FOUND LARGE REDUCTIONS IN DISTRESS, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION (D = -0.69 TO -0.75), MODERATE REDUCTIONS IN FATIGUE (D = -0.51), MODERATE INCREASES IN GENERAL QUALITY OF LIFE, EMOTIONAL FUNCTION AND SOCIAL FUNCTION (D = 0.33 TO 0.49), AND A SMALL INCREASE IN FUNCTIONAL WELL-BEING (D = 0.31). EFFECTS ON PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND SLEEP WERE SMALL AND NOT SIGNIFICANT. CONCLUSION: YOGA APPEARED TO BE A FEASIBLE INTERVENTION AND BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON SEVERAL PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL SYMPTOMS WERE REPORTED. IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER, EFFECT SIZE ON FUNCTIONAL WELL-BEING WAS SMALL, AND THEY WERE MODERATE TO LARGE FOR PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
10 1040  43 EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTION DURING PREGNANCY: A REVIEW FOR CURRENT STATUS. OBJECTIVES: THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO REVIEW ALL RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS (RCTS) THAT HAVE LOOKED AT THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PREGNANCY, AND TO PRESENT THEIR EVIDENCE ON THE SPECIFIC WAYS IN WHICH PREGNANT WOMEN, AND THEIR INFANTS CAN BENEFIT FROM YOGA INTERVENTION. THE PURPOSE IS ALSO TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOGA INTERVENTION DURING PREGNANCY IS MORE BENEFICIAL THAN OTHER PHYSICAL EXERCISES. METHODS: FOUR DATABASES WERE SEARCHED USING THE TERMS "YOGA AND (PREGNANCY OR PREGNANT OR PRENATAL OR POSTNATAL OR POSTPARTUM)." DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FROM JANUARY 2004 TO FEBRUARY 2014. RESULTS: TEN RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE EVALUATED. THE FINDINGS CONSISTENTLY INDICATE THAT YOGA INTERVENTION PRESENTED WITH LOWER INCIDENCES OF PRENATAL DISORDERS (P </= 0.05), AND SMALL GESTATIONAL AGE (P < 0.05), LOWER LEVELS OF PAIN AND STRESS (P < 0.05), AND HIGHER SCORE OF RELATIONSHIP (P < 0.05). IN ADDITION, YOGA CAN BE SAFELY USED FOR PREGNANT WOMEN WHO ARE DEPRESSED, AT HIGH-RISK, OR EXPERIENCE LUMBOPELVIC PAIN. MOREOVER, YOGA IS A MORE EFFECTIVE EXERCISE THAN WALKING OR STANDARD PRENATAL EXERCISES. CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA IS A SAFE AND MORE EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION DURING PREGNANCY. HOWEVER, FURTHER RCTS ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE FIRMER EVIDENCE REGARDING THE UTILITY AND VALIDITY OF YOGA INTERVENTION.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
11 2592  36 YOGA FOR MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AS A TREATMENT OPTION FOR MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS. METHODS: WE SEARCHED THE LITERATURE USING 14 DATABASES FROM THEIR INCEPTION TO JULY 2008 AND INCLUDED ALL TYPES OF CLINICAL STUDIES REGARDLESS OF THEIR DESIGN. THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF ALL STUDIES WAS ASSESSED USING A MODIFIED JADAD SCORE. RESULTS: SEVEN STUDIES MET OUR INCLUSION CRITERIA. TWO RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS COMPARED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA WITH THOSE OF WALKING OR PHYSICAL EXERCISE. THE META-ANALYSIS OF THESE DATA FAILED TO SHOW SPECIFIC EFFECTS OF YOGA ON MENOPAUSAL COMPLAINTS INCLUDING PSYCHOLOGICAL, SOMATIC, AND VASOMOTOR SYMPTOMS. TWO RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS FOUND NO EFFECTS OF YOGA ON TOTAL MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS COMPARED WITH WAIT-LIST CONTROL OR NO TREATMENT. THE REMAINING STUDIES WERE EITHER NON-RANDOMIZED (N = 1) OR UNCONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS (N = 3). THEY REPORTED FAVORABLE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS. THESE DATA COLLECTIVELY SHOW THAT THE RESULTS OF RIGOROUS STUDIES OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA FOR MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS ARE UNCONVINCING. CONCLUSION: THE EVIDENCE IS INSUFFICIENT TO SUGGEST THAT YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR MENOPAUSE. FURTHER RESEARCH IS REQUIRED TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER THERE ARE SPECIFIC BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR TREATING MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
12 2365  33 WALKING IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN YOGA AT REDUCING SLEEP DISTURBANCE IN CANCER PATIENTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. THIS REVIEW AIMED TO DETERMINE WHETHER WALKING IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN YOGA AT IMPROVING SLEEP DISTURBANCE IN CANCER PATIENTS. A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WAS PERFORMED IN THE PUBMED, EMBASE, CINAHL, COCHRANE LIBRARY, CNKI, AIRITI LIBRARY, AND OTHER HEALTH-RELATED DATABASES. TWENTY-FIVE STUDIES WERE IDENTIFIED WITH A TOTAL OF 1918 PARTICIPANTS. THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX WAS THE MOST COMMONLY USED OUTCOME MEASUREMENT TOOL, AND MODERATE-INTENSITY WALKING WAS THE MOST FREQUENTLY USED INTERVENTION. THE MAJORITY OF THE INCLUDED SUBJECTS WERE BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. OVERALL, WALKING SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED SLEEP DISTURBANCE COMPARED TO YOGA (P = 0.01). STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT MODERATORS INCLUDED ADHERENCE RATE FOR WALKING (P < 0.001) AND ALLOCATION CONCEALMENT AND OUTCOME MEASUREMENT TOOL FOR YOGA (P = 0.04; P = 0.03). WE CONCLUDED THAT WALKING IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN YOGA IN IMPROVING SLEEP DISTURBANCE IN CANCER PATIENTS. THUS, MODERATE-INTENSITY WALKING IS RECOMMENDED FOR CANCER PATIENTS WITH SLEEP DISTURBANCE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
13 2742  42 YOGA PRACTICE FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE II DIABETES MELLITUS IN ADULTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. THE EFFECT OF PRACTICING YOGA FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE II DIABETES WAS ASSESSED IN THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW THROUGH SEARCHING RELATED ELECTRONIC DATABASES AND THE GREY LITERATURE TO THE END OF MAY 2007 USING OVID. ALL RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS (RCTS) COMPARING YOGA PRACTICE WITH OTHER TYPE OF INTERVENTION OR WITH REGULAR PRACTICE OR BOTH, WERE INCLUDED REGARDLESS OF LANGUAGE OR TYPE OF PUBLICATION. EACH STUDY WAS ASSESSED FOR QUALITY BY TWO INDEPENDENT REVIEWERS. MEAN DIFFERENCE WAS USED FOR SUMMARIZING THE EFFECT OF EACH STUDY OUTCOMES WITH 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS. POOLING OF THE STUDIES DID NOT TAKE PLACE DUE TO THE WIDE CLINICAL VARIATION BETWEEN THE STUDIES. PUBLICATION BIAS WAS ASSESSED BY STATISTICAL METHODS. FIVE TRIALS WITH 363 PARTICIPANTS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA WITH MEDIUM TO HIGH RISK OF BIAS AND DIFFERENT INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS. THE STUDIES' RESULTS SHOW IMPROVEMENT IN OUTCOMES AMONG PATIENTS WITH DIABETES TYPE II. THESE IMPROVEMENTS WERE MAINLY AMONG SHORT TERM OR IMMEDIATE DIABETES OUTCOMES AND NOT ALL WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. THE RESULTS WERE INCONCLUSIVE AND NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR THE LONG-TERM OUTCOMES. NO ADVERSE EFFECTS WERE REPORTED IN ANY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES. SHORT-TERM BENEFITS FOR PATIENTS WITH DIABETES MAY BE ACHIEVED FROM PRACTICING YOGA. FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED IN THIS AREA. FACTORS LIKE QUALITY OF THE TRIALS AND OTHER METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES SHOULD BE IMPROVED BY LARGE RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS WITH ALLOCATION CONCEALMENT TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA ON DIABETES TYPE II. A DEFINITIVE RECOMMENDATION FOR PHYSICIANS TO ENCOURAGE THEIR PATIENTS TO PRACTICE YOGA CANNOT BE REACHED AT PRESENT.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
14 1077  45 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PSYCHOLOGIC FUNCTION AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER: A META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS META-ANALYSIS WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PSYCHOLOGIC FUNCTION AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER. DESIGN: A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH OF PUBMED, EMBASE, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, THE CHINESE BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE DATABASE, AND THE CHINESE DIGITAL JOURNALS FULL-TEXT DATABASE WAS CARRIED OUT. RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS (RCTS) EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA, VERSUS A CONTROL GROUP RECEIVING NO INTERVENTION, ON PSYCHOLOGIC FUNCTIONING AND QOL IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER WERE INCLUDED. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF INCLUDED RCTS WAS ASSESSED ACCORDING TO THE COCHRANE HANDBOOK FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF INTERVENTIONS 5.0.1, AND DATA WERE ANALYZED USING THE COCHRANE COLLABORATION'S REVIEW MANAGER 5.1. RESULTS: SIX (6) STUDIES INVOLVING 382 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED. THE META-ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT YOGA CAN IMPROVE QOL FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER. A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT FAVORING YOGA FOR THE OUTCOME OF QOL WAS FOUND (STANDARD MEAN DIFFERENCE=0.27, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [0.02, 0.52], P=0.03). ALTHOUGH THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PSYCHOLOGIC FUNCTION OUTCOMES--SUCH AS ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, DISTRESS AND SLEEP--WERE IN THE EXPECTED DIRECTION, THESE EFFECTS WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P>0.05). FATIGUE SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: THE PRESENT DATA PROVIDED LITTLE INDICATION OF HOW EFFECTIVE YOGA MIGHT BE WHEN THEY WERE APPLIED BY WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER EXCEPT FOR MILDLY EFFECTIVE IN QOL IMPROVEMENT. THE FINDINGS WERE BASED ON A SMALL BODY OF EVIDENCE IN WHICH METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY WAS NOT HIGH. FURTHER WELL-DESIGNED RCTS WITH LARGE SAMPLE SIZE ARE NEEDED TO CLARIFY THE UTILITY OF YOGA PRACTICE FOR THIS POPULATION.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
15 1043  35 EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON FATIGUE: A META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND. RESEARCHERS AIMED AT SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEWING AND META-ANALYZING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR FATIGUE. METHODS. PUBMED/MEDLINE WAS SEARCHED UNTIL JANUARY 2012 FOR CONTROLLED CLINICAL STUDIES. TWO REVIEWERS INDEPENDENTLY EXTRACTED THE DATA. THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF THE STUDIES WAS ASSESSED. A META-ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED. RESULTS. NINETEEN CLINICAL STUDIES (TOTAL N = 948) WERE INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW. INVESTIGATED YOGA STYLES INCLUDED HATHA, IYENGAR, ASANAS, PATANJALI, SAHAJA, AND TIBETAN YOGA. PARTICIPANTS WERE SUFFERING FROM CANCER, MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, DIALYSIS, CHRONIC PANCREATITIS, FIBROMYALGIA, ASTHMA, OR WERE HEALTHY. YOGA HAD A SMALL POSITIVE EFFECT ON FATIGUE (SMD = 0.27, 59% CI = 0.23-0.31). SEVEN STUDIES RECEIVED 4 POINTS ON THE JADAD SCORE. THERE WERE BASELINE DIFFERENCES IN AT LEAST 5 STUDIES. CONCLUSION. OVERALL, THE EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON FATIGUE WERE ONLY SMALL, PARTICULARLY IN CANCER PATIENTS. ALTHOUGH YOGA IS GENERALLY A SAFE THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION AND EFFECTIVE TO ATTENUATE OTHER HEALTH-RELATED SYMPTOMS, THIS META-ANALYSIS WAS NOT ABLE TO DEFINE THE POWERFUL EFFECT OF YOGA ON PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM FATIGUE. TREATMENT EFFECTS OF YOGA COULD BE IMPROVED IN WELL-DESIGNED FUTURE STUDIES. ACCORDING TO THE GRADE RECOMMENDATIONS ASSESSING THE OVERALL QUALITY OF EVIDENCE, THERE IS A MODERATE EFFECT OF THE CONFIDENCE PLACED IN THE ESTIMATES OF THE EFFECTS DISCUSSED HERE.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
16 2172  35 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON DEPRESSION AND MOTOR FUNCTION IN PATIENTS WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE: A REVIEW OF CONTROLLED STUDIES. BACKGROUND: PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD) IS A NEURODEGENERATIVE/NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDER CHARACTERIZED BY BOTH MOTOR AND NON-MOTOR SYMPTOMOLOGY. THE REPORTED PREVALENCE OF DEPRESSION IN PATIENTS WITH PD IS DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN DUE TO OVERLAPPING SOMATIC SYMPTOMS AND FAILURE TO SELF-REPORT SYMPTOMS. ALTHOUGH ANTIDEPRESSANTS REMAIN A FIRST-LINE TREATMENT, THEY CAN HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS. RECENTLY, LITERATURE HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT DUE TO ITS ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PROPERTIES, YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE NONPHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY FOR DEPRESSION. METHODS: A SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) PUBLISHED FROM JANUARY 2000 TO JANUARY 2019 THAT ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON DEPRESSION AND MOTOR FUNCTIONING IN PD. RESULTS: THREE STUDIES MET THE CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION. IN ONE RCT, BIWEEKLY YOGA RESULTED IN A DECREASE IN DEPRESSION SCORE (P = .056). IN ANOTHER RCT, WEEKLY YOGA RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN DEPRESSION AND DEMONSTRATED THAT ITS THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS ARE LONG-LASTING. FINALLY, IN A THIRD RCT, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND BETWEEN CONTROL AND EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS IN DEPRESSION AFTER BIWEEKLY YOGA. HOWEVER, YOGA WAS FOUND TO BE PROTECTIVE AGAINST WORSENING OF DEPRESSION. CONCLUSIONS: OUR REVIEW SUGGESTS THAT THE PRACTICE OF YOGA MAY BE A USEFUL NONPHARMACOLOGIC ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION IN PATIENTS WITH PD. HOWEVER, MORE CONTROLLED RCTS ARE NEEDED TO VALIDATE OUR CONCLUSIONS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
17  227  37 A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE EFFECT OF LAUGHTER YOGA ON PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES IN OLDER ADULTS. BACKGROUND: LAUGHTER YOGA IS ONE OF THE INCREASINGLY USED METHODS AMONG COMPLEMENTARY HEALTH APPROACHES IN THE WORLD. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LAUGHTER YOGA ON PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES IN OLDER ADULTS. METHODS: IN THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW, ELECTRONIC SEARCHES WERE PERFORMED IN CINAHL, WEB OF SCIENCE, COCHRANE, SCOPUS, PROQUEST DATABASES FROM MAY 2010 TO MAY 2020. THE SCREENING PROCESS WAS CONDUCTED BY TWO AUTHORS INDEPENDENTLY AND FINALLY AGREED TOGETHER. THE REVIEW WAS REPORTED ACCORDING TO PRISMA GUIDELINE. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 3210 STUDIES WERE EXAMINED, AND SEVEN PUBLICATIONS (SIX QUASI EXPERIMENTAL AND ONE RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL), IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INCLUSION CRITERIA WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY AND EVALUATED. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LAUGHTER YOGA ON PHYSICAL FUNCTION (BLOOD PRESSURE, CORTISOL LEVEL, SLEEP QUALITY) AND PSYCHOSOCIAL HEALTH (LIFE SATISFACTION, QUALITY OF LIFE, LONELINESS, DEATH ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, MOOD, HAPPINESS) IN OLDER ADULTS. CONCLUSION: LAUGHTER YOGA IS A COST-EFFECTIVE AND NO ADVERSE EFFECT IN OLDER ADULTS. IT CAN BE USED FOR HEALTH PROMOTION FOR OLDER ADULTS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
18 2683  44 YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC DISEASE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: HEART DISEASE, STROKE, AND CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD) ARE THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH AND DISABILITY WORLDWIDE. ALTHOUGH INDIVIDUALS WITH THESE CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO BENEFIT FROM YOGA, ITS EFFECTIVENESS REMAINS UNCLEAR. OBJECTIVE: TO PERFORM A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA ON EXERCISE CAPACITY, HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQL), AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC DISEASE AND DESCRIBE THE STRUCTURE AND DELIVERY OF PROGRAMS. RESEARCH DESIGN: WE PERFORMED A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS EXAMINING YOGA PROGRAMS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH HEART DISEASE, STROKE, AND COPD COMPARED WITH USUAL CARE. QUALITY WAS ASSESSED USING THE COCHRANE RISK OF BIAS TOOL. META-ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED USING REVIEW MANAGER 5.3. THE PROTOCOL WAS REGISTERED ON PROSPERO (CRD42014014589). RESULTS: TEN STUDIES (431 INDIVIDUALS, MEAN AGE 56+/-8 Y) WERE INCLUDED AND WERE COMPARABLE IN THEIR DESIGN AND COMPONENTS, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE CHRONIC DISEASE. THE STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE FOR THE MEAN CHANGE IN EXERCISE CAPACITY WAS 2.69 (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, 1.39-3.99) AND FOR HRQL IT WAS 1.24 (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, -0.37 TO 2.85). SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY WERE REDUCED AFTER YOGA IN INDIVIDUALS WITH STROKE, ALTHOUGH THIS WAS NOT OBSERVED IN INDIVIDUALS WITH COPD. THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION VARIED ACROSS STUDIES WITH NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS COMPARED WITH USUAL CARE. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA PROGRAMS HAVE SIMILAR DESIGNS AND COMPONENTS ACROSS CHRONIC DISEASE POPULATIONS. COMPARED WITH USUAL CARE, YOGA RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN EXERCISE CAPACITY AND A MEAN IMPROVEMENT IN HRQL. YOGA PROGRAMS MAY BE A USEFUL ADJUNCT TO FORMAL REHABILITATION PROGRAMS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
19 2230  37 THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON FATIGUE IN CANCER SURVIVORSHIP: A META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: MIND-BODY APPROACHES, PARTICULARLY YOGA, ARE USED BY CANCER SURVIVORS TO COPE WITH TREATMENT-RELATED SYMPTOMS. CONSISTENCY OF YOGA-RELATED EFFECTS ON TREATMENT-RELATED SYMPTOMS ARE NOT KNOWN. THIS META-ANALYSIS WAS DESIGNED TO EXAMINE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PRE- TO POSTINTERVENTION IMPROVEMENTS IN FATIGUE AMONG CANCER PATIENTS. METHODS: PUBMED AND PSYCINFO WERE SEARCHED FOR PEER-REVIEWED ARTICLES OF YOGA RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS INCLUDING CANCER SURVIVORS AND REPORTING AT LEAST ONE FATIGUE MEASURE. TWENTY-NINE STUDIES MET INCLUSION CRITERIA (N = 1828 PATIENTS). EFFECT SIZES (HEDGE'S G) WERE CALCULATED FOR FATIGUE, DEPRESSION, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. PATIENT-RELATED AND INTERVENTION-RELATED CHARACTERISTICS WERE TESTED AS MODERATORS OF OUTCOMES. ALL STATISTICAL TESTS WERE TWO-SIDED. RESULTS: YOGA PRACTICE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A SMALL, STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN FATIGUE (G = 0.45, P = .013). YOGA TYPE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT MODERATOR OF THIS RELATIONSHIP (P = .02). YOGA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A MODERATE DECREASE IN DEPRESSION (G = 0.72, P = .007) BUT WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN QUALITY OF LIFE (P = .48). SESSION LENGTH WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT MODERATOR OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOGA AND DEPRESSION (P = .004). NEITHER TIMING OF TREATMENT (DURING TREATMENT VS POSTTREATMENT) NOR CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT MODERATORS OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON OUTCOMES. THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON FATIGUE AND DEPRESSION WAS LARGER WHEN THE COMPARATOR WAS A "WAITLIST" OR "USUAL CARE" THAN WHEN THE CONTROL GROUP WAS ANOTHER ACTIVE TREATMENT (P = .036). CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS SUGGEST YOGA MAY BE BENEFICIAL AS A COMPONENT OF TREATMENT FOR BOTH FATIGUE AND DEPRESSION IN CANCER SURVIVORS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
20 2915  37 [SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF YOGA FOR DEPRESSION AND QUALITY OF SLEEP IN THE ELDERLY]. BACKGROUND: AGING AND AGE-RELATED HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE MAJOR ISSUES OF CONCERN FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH SERVICES. YOGA IS AN EXERCISE WITH BOTH PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS ON AGING. ALTHOUGH MANY STUDIES HAVE ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN THE ELDERLY, LITTLE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE IN THE LITERATURE TO SUPPORT EMPIRICAL CONCLUSIONS. PURPOSE: THIS REVIEW SYNTHESIZES AND CHARACTERIZES FINDINGS RELATED TO THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON DEPRESSION AND QUALITY OF SLEEP IN THE ELDERLY. METHODS: RESEARCHERS USED KEYWORDS INCLUDING YOGA, ELDERLY, AGED / OLDER ADULT, DEPRESSION, SLEEP, AND QUALITY TO SEARCH 6 ELECTRONIC DATABASES FOR RELEVANT STUDIES PUBLISHED PRIOR TO MARCH 2013. INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA WERE USED TO SCREEN IDENTIFIED STUDY ABSTRACTS. THE JADAD SCALE APPRAISED THE QUALITY OF IDENTIFIED STUDIES. RESULTS: SEVEN STUDIES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. FIVE STUDIES FOUND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PARTICIPANT DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AFTER DOING YOGA. THREE STUDIES FOUND SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON THE QUALITY OF SLEEP OF PARTICIPANTS AFTER 6 MONTHS OF DOING YOGA. CONCLUSION: YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS OF ELDERLY PARTICIPANTS AND IMPROVED THEIR QUALITY OF SLEEP AFTER 6 MONTHS. FINDINGS WERE SIMILAR FOR ELDERLY LIVING IN INSTITUTIONS AND IN THE COMMUNITY. HOWEVER, THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE ASSESSED STUDIES WERE WOMEN CHARACTERIZED BY A HIGH LEVEL OF SOCIAL PARTICIPATION AND PROACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN HEALTH PROMOTION ACTIVITIES. FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD BROADEN THE SCOPE OF RESEARCH TO ADDRESS DIFFERENT AGING POPULATIONS AND USE LONG-TERM COHORT OBSERVATIONS IN ORDER TO BETTER ELICIT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AND TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO INTRODUCE YOGA INTO DAILY ACTIVITIES.	2014

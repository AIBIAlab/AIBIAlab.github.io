1 1005 120 EFFECTS OF MINDFUL YOGA ON SLEEP IN PREGNANT WOMEN: A PILOT STUDY. PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS EXPERIMENTAL PILOT STUDY WAS TO MEASURE THE EFFECTS OF A MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION ON SLEEP IN PREGNANT WOMEN. METHODS: FIFTEEN HEALTHY, NULLIPAROUS WOMEN IN THEIR SECOND OR THIRD TRIMESTERS WITH SINGLETON PREGNANCIES ATTENDED WEEKLY MINDFULNESS MEDITATION AND PRENATAL HATHA YOGA CLASSES IN THE COMMUNITY FOR 7 WEEKS. SLEEP VARIABLES, AS ESTIMATED BY 72 HR OF CONTINUOUS WRIST ACTIGRAPHY AND THE GENERAL SLEEP DISTURBANCE SCALE (GSDS), WERE RECORDED AT BASELINE (TIME 1) AND POSTINTERVENTION (TIME 2). CONTROL DATA WERE OBTAINED BY EVALUATING SLEEP IN THE THIRD-TRIMESTER GROUP AT TIME 1. DUE TO SMALL SAMPLE SIZE, DATA WERE ANALYZED USING PARAMETRIC AND NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICS. RESULTS: WOMEN WHO BEGAN THE INTERVENTION IN THE SECOND TRIMESTER HAD SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER AWAKENINGS, LESS WAKE TIME DURING THE NIGHT, AND LESS PERCEIVED SLEEP DISTURBANCE AT TIME 2 THAN AT BASELINE. THOSE WHO BEGAN DURING THE THIRD TRIMESTER HAD POORER SLEEP OVER TIME IN SPITE OF THE INTERVENTION. WOMEN WHO BEGAN THE INTERVENTION IN THEIR SECOND TRIMESTER HAD LESS AWAKE TIME AT TIME 2 COMPARED TO THIRD-TRIMESTER CONTROLS AT TIME 1. CONCLUSIONS: MINDFUL YOGA SHOWS PROMISE FOR WOMEN IN THEIR SECOND TRIMESTER OF PREGNANCY TO DIMINISH TOTAL NUMBER OF AWAKENINGS AT NIGHT AND IMPROVE SLEEP EFFICIENCY AND MERITS FURTHER EXPLORATION. RESULTS FROM THIS PILOT STUDY PROVIDE THE DATA TO ESTIMATE SAMPLE SIZE AND DESIGN AND IMPLEMENT POWERED AND MORE CONTROLLED STUDIES IN THE FUTURE.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
2 1224  33 FEASIBILITY AND ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME MEASURES FOR YOGA AS SELF-CARE FOR MINORITIES WITH ARTHRITIS: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: WHILE THERE IS A GROWING INTEREST IN THE THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS OF YOGA, MINORITY POPULATIONS WITH ARTHRITIS TEND TO BE UNDER-REPRESENTED IN THE RESEARCH. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS AN ABSENCE OF GUIDANCE IN THE LITERATURE REGARDING THE USE OF MULTICULTURAL TEAMS AND SOCIOCULTURAL HEALTH BELIEFS, WHEN DESIGNING YOGA STUDIES FOR A RACIALLY DIVERSE POPULATION WITH ARTHRITIS. THIS PILOT STUDY EXAMINED THE FEASIBILITY OF OFFERING YOGA AS A SELF-CARE MODALITY TO AN URBAN, BILINGUAL, MINORITY POPULATION WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) OR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA), IN THE WASHINGTON, DC AREA. METHODS: THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF OFFERING AN 8-WEEK, BILINGUAL YOGA INTERVENTION ADAPTED FOR ARTHRITIS TO A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF PRIMARILY HISPANIC AND BLACK/AFRICAN-AMERICAN ADULTS. A RACIALLY DIVERSE INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH TEAM WAS ASSEMBLED TO DESIGN A STUDY TO FACILITATE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION. THE SECOND OBJECTIVE IDENTIFIED OUTCOME MEASURES TO OPERATIONALIZE POTENTIAL FACILITATORS AND BARRIERS TO SELF-CARE AND SELF-EFFICACY. THE THIRD OBJECTIVE DETERMINED THE FEASIBILITY OF USING COMPUTER-ASSISTED SELF-INTERVIEW (CASI) FOR DATA COLLECTION. RESULTS: ENROLLED PARTICIPANTS (N = 30) WERE MOSTLY FEMALE (93%), SPANISH SPEAKING (69%), AND DIAGNOSED WITH RA (88.5%). FEASIBILITY WAS EVALUATED USING PRACTICALITY, ACCEPTABILITY, ADAPTATION, AND EXPANSION OF AN ARTHRITIS-ADAPTED YOGA INTERVENTION, MODIFIED FOR THIS POPULATION. RECRUITMENT (51%) AND PARTICIPATION (60%) RATES WERE SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND CLINICAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE STUDY POPULATION. OF THOSE ENROLLED, 18 STARTED THE INTERVENTION. FOR ADHERENCE, 12 OUT OF 18 (67%) PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE INTERVENTION. ALL (100%), WHO COMPLETED THE INTERVENTION, CONTINUED TO PRACTICE YOGA 3 MONTHS AFTER COMPLETING THE STUDY. USING NONPARAMETRIC TESTS, SELECTED OUTCOME MEASURES SHOWED A MEASURABLE CHANGE POST-INTERVENTION SUGGESTING APPROPRIATE USE IN FUTURE STUDIES. AN IN-PERSON COMPUTERIZED QUESTIONNAIRE WAS DETERMINED TO BE A FEASIBLE METHOD OF DATA COLLECTION. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS FROM THIS PILOT STUDY CONFIRM THE FEASIBILITY OF OFFERING YOGA TO THIS RACIALLY/ETHNICALLY DIVERSE POPULATION WITH ARTHRITIS. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES RECRUITMENT/RETENTION RATES, OUTCOME MEASURES WITH ERROR RATES, AND DATA COLLECTION RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A PREVIOUSLY UNDER-REPRESENTED POPULATION. SUGGESTIONS INCLUDE ALLOCATING RESOURCES FOR TRANSLATION AND USING A MULTICULTURAL DESIGN TO FACILITATE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION.

3  667  36 EFFECT OF A 12-WEEK YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM ON MENTAL HEALTH STATUS IN ELDERLY WOMEN INMATES OF A HOSPICE. AIM AND OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA ON THE MENTAL HEALTH STATUS OF ELDERLY WOMEN INMATES RESIDING IN A HOSPICE IN PUDUCHERRY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FORTY ELDERLY WOMEN WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO YOGA AND WAIT-LISTED CONTROL GROUP. A YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM OF 60 MIN WAS GIVEN TWICE A WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS. THIS PROTOCOL WAS SPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR SENIOR CITIZENS, KEEPING IN MIND THEIR HEALTH STATUS AND PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS THAT INCLUDED SIMPLE WARM-UP AND BREATH-BODY MOVEMENT COORDINATION PRACTICES (JATHIS AND KRIYAS), STATIC STRETCHING POSTURES (ASANAS), BREATHING TECHNIQUES (PRANAYAMAS), AND RELAXATION. HAMILTON ANXIETY SCALE FOR MEASURING ANXIETY, HAMILTON RATING SCALE FOR DEPRESSION, AND ROSENBERG SELF-ESTEEM SCALE TO MEASURE SELF-ESTEEM WERE ADMINISTERED TO BOTH GROUPS BEFORE AND AFTER THE 12-WEEK STUDY PERIOD. DATA WERE ASSESSED FOR NORMALITY, AND APPROPRIATE PARAMETRIC AND NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICAL METHODS WERE APPLIED FOR INTRA- AND INTER-GROUP COMPARISONS. RESULTS: OVERALL, INTRA- AND INTER-GROUP COMPARISON OF PREPOST DATA SHOWED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.001) DIFFERENCES FOR ALL THREE PARAMETERS. THERE WAS AN OVERALL IMPROVEMENT IN THE SCORES INDICATING DECREASED LEVELS OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY COUPLED WITH AN INCREASE IN THE LEVEL OF SELF-ESTEEM AFTER THE YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM. DISCUSSION: THE INFLUENCE OF YOGA IN THE REDUCTION OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SCORES AND IMPROVEMENT IN SELF-ESTEEM SCORES IN ELDERLY WOMEN SUBJECTS IS EVIDENT FROM THIS STUDY. AS REPORTED IN EARLIER STUDIES, THIS MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO CHANGES IN CENTRAL NEUROTRANSMITTERS SUCH AS GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID COUPLED WITH INCREASED PARASYMPATHETIC TONE AND DECREASED SYMPATHO-ADRENAL ACTIVITY. CONCLUSION: IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOGA SHOULD BE A PART OF HEALTH-CARE FACILITIES FOR ELDERLY AS IT CAN ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF LIFE BY IMPROVING THEIR OVERALL MENTAL HEALTH STATUS. IT COULD PROVIDE A HEALTHY AND POSITIVE ALTERNATIVE FROM DEPRESSING NEGATIVE THOUGHTS, AND GIVE THEM A SENSE OF PURPOSE AND HOPE.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
4 2147  43 THE EFFECTS OF MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA DURING PREGNANCY ON MATERNAL PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL DISTRESS. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND LEVEL OF ACCEPTABILITY OF A MINDFUL YOGA INTERVENTION PROVIDED DURING PREGNANCY AND TO GATHER PRELIMINARY DATA ON THE EFFICACY OF THE INTERVENTION IN REDUCING DISTRESS. DESIGN: BASELINE AND POST-TREATMENT MEASURES EXAMINED STATE AND TRAIT ANXIETY, PERCEIVED STRESS, PAIN, AND MORNING SALIVARY CORTISOL IN A SINGLE TREATMENT GROUP. POSTINTERVENTION DATA ALSO INCLUDED PARTICIPANT EVALUATION OF THE INTERVENTION. SETTING: THE 7 WEEKS MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA GROUP INTERVENTION COMBINED ELEMENTS OF IYENGAR YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION. PARTICIPANTS: SIXTEEN HEALTHY PREGNANT NULLIPAROUS WOMEN WITH SINGLETON PREGNANCIES BETWEEN 12 AND 32 WEEKS GESTATION AT THE TIME OF ENROLLMENT. METHODS: OUTCOMES WERE EVALUATED FROM PRE- TO POSTINTERVENTION AND BETWEEN SECOND AND THIRD TRIMESTERS WITH REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE AND POST HOC NONPARAMETRIC TESTS. RESULTS: WOMEN PRACTICING MINDFUL YOGA IN THEIR SECOND TRIMESTER REPORTED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN PHYSICAL PAIN FROM BASELINE TO POSTINTERVENTION COMPARED WITH WOMEN IN THE THIRD TRIMESTER WHOSE PAIN INCREASED. WOMEN IN THEIR THIRD TRIMESTER SHOWED GREATER REDUCTIONS IN PERCEIVED STRESS AND TRAIT ANXIETY. CONCLUSIONS: PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE SUPPORTS YOGA'S POTENTIAL EFFICACY IN THESE AREAS, PARTICULARLY IF STARTED EARLY IN THE PREGNANCY.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
5 1538  36 KNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDES TOWARD PRENATAL YOGA AMONG WOMEN WITH HIGH-RISK PREGNANCIES. THIS STUDY SOUGHT TO EVALUATE ATTITUDES AND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT PRENATAL YOGA AND TO INVESTIGATE BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO YOGA PARTICIPATION IN HIGH-RISK PREGNANT WOMEN RECEIVING PRENATAL CARE IN AN ACADEMIC TERTIARY CARE CENTER. WE SURVEYED A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF WOMEN RECEIVING PRENATAL CARE THROUGH THE MATERNAL-FETAL MEDICINE PRACTICE AT BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL. WE CLASSIFIED PARTICIPANTS AS YOGA-EXPERIENCED OR YOGA-NAIVE DEPENDING ON SELF-REPORT. WE COMPARED DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS USING THE APPROPRIATE NONPARAMETRIC TESTS AND COMPARED BIVARIATE ODDS RATIOS FOR SURVEY RESULTS USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION. OF THE 100 RESPONDENTS, 53% HAD PRACTICED YOGA PREVIOUSLY. WOMEN WITH YOGA EXPERIENCE WERE OLDER (AGE 34.9 +/- 5.6 VS. 31.0 +/- 6.0 YEARS, P = 0.004), MORE LIKELY TO BE COLLEGE GRADUATES (94% VS. 68%, P = 0.002), AND MORE LIKELY TO BE WHITE (77% VS. 47%, P = 0.002) THAN WOMEN WITHOUT PREVIOUS YOGA EXPERIENCE. PREVIOUS YOGA EXPERIENCE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH PARTICIPANT AGREEMENT THAT YOGA WAS SAFE DURING THEIR CURRENT PREGNANCY (ODDS RATIO 5.9, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL 1.9-17.7). OF THE WOMEN SURVEYED, 56% AGREED THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO ATTEND A PRENATAL YOGA CLASS. IN A MULTIVARIATE MODEL INCLUDING AGE, RACE, AND EDUCATION, PREVIOUS YOGA EXPERIENCE WAS THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR ASSOCIATED WITH WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN PRENATAL YOGA CLASSES DURING CURRENT PREGNANCY (ODDS RATIO 3.1, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL 1.1-8.6). PRIOR YOGA EXPERIENCE WAS THE STRONGEST PREDICTOR OF WILLINGNESS TO ATTEND A PRENATAL YOGA CLASS IN OUR POPULATION. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT WOMEN WITH HIGH-RISK PREGNANCIES WHO MAY BENEFIT FROM PRENATAL YOGA INTERVENTIONS BUT LACK PRIOR YOGA EXPERIENCE MAY NEED ADDITIONAL EDUCATION TO FACILITATE PARTICIPATION.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
6 1462  33 INFLUENCE OF YOGA ON POSTOPERATIVE OUTCOMES AND WOUND HEALING IN EARLY OPERABLE BREAST CANCER PATIENTS UNDERGOING SURGERY. CONTEXT: PRE- AND POSTOPERATIVE DISTRESS IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS CAN CAUSE COMPLICATIONS AND DELAY RECOVERY FROM SURGERY. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF OUR STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON POSTOPERATIVE OUTCOMES AND WOUND HEALING IN EARLY OPERABLE BREAST CANCER PATIENTS UNDERGOING SURGERY. METHODS: NINETY-EIGHT RECENTLY DIAGNOSED STAGE II AND III BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WERE RECRUITED IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA PROGRAM WITH SUPPORTIVE THERAPY AND EXERCISE REHABILITATION ON POSTOPERATIVE OUTCOMES AND WOUND HEALING FOLLOWING SURGERY. SUBJECTS WERE ASSESSED AT THE BASELINE PRIOR TO SURGERY AND FOUR WEEKS LATER. SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC, CLINICAL AND INVESTIGATIVE NOTES WERE ASCERTAINED IN THE BEGINNING OF THE STUDY. BLOOD SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED FOR ESTIMATION OF PLASMA CYTOKINES-SOLUBLE INTERLEUKIN (IL)-2 RECEPTOR (IL-2R), TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR (TNF)-ALPHA AND INTERFERON (IFN)-GAMMA. POSTOPERATIVE OUTCOMES SUCH AS THE DURATION OF HOSPITAL STAY AND DRAIN RETENTION, TIME OF SUTURE REMOVAL AND POSTOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS WERE ASCERTAINED. WE USED INDEPENDENT SAMPLES T TEST AND NONPARAMETRIC MANN WHITNEY U TESTS TO COMPARE GROUPS FOR POSTOPERATIVE OUTCOMES AND PLASMA CYTOKINES. REGRESSION ANALYSIS WAS DONE TO DETERMINE PREDICTORS FOR POSTOPERATIVE OUTCOMES. RESULTS: SIXTY-NINE PATIENTS CONTRIBUTED DATA TO THE CURRENT ANALYSIS (YOGA: N = 33, CONTROL: N = 36). THE RESULTS SUGGEST A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE DURATION OF HOSPITAL STAY (P = 0.003), DAYS OF DRAIN RETENTION (P = 0.001) AND DAYS FOR SUTURE REMOVAL (P = 0.03) IN THE YOGA GROUP AS COMPARED TO THE CONTROLS. THERE WAS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN PLASMA TNF ALPHA LEVELS FOLLOWING SURGERY IN THE YOGA GROUP (P < 0.001), AS COMPARED TO THE CONTROLS. REGRESSION ANALYSIS ON POSTOPERATIVE OUTCOMES SHOWED THAT THE YOGA INTERVENTION AFFECTED THE DURATION OF DRAIN RETENTION AND HOSPITAL STAY AS WELL AS TNF ALPHA LEVELS. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS SUGGEST POSSIBLE BENEFITS OF YOGA IN REDUCING POSTOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
7 2840  37 YOGA, AS A TRANSITIONAL PLATFORM TO MORE ACTIVE LIFESTYLE: A 6-MONTH PILOT STUDY IN THE USA. A 6-MONTH PILOT STUDY EXPLORED THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA PROGRAM ON THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (PA) LEVEL OF OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE SEDENTARY ADULTS. FOURTEEN COMMUNITY-DWELLING OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE SEDENTARY ADULTS PARTICIPATED IN A 6-MONTH PROGRAM (2-MONTH YOGA PROGRAM AND 4-MONTH FOLLOW-UP) DELIVERED BY TWO TYPES OF INSTRUCTION [THE DIRECT GUIDANCE OF AN INSTRUCTOR (FACE-TO-FACE GROUP) VS. THE SELF-LEARNING METHOD OF USING A DVD (DVD GROUP)]. MEASUREMENTS INCLUDED PROGRAM ADHERENCE (CLASS ATTENDANCE AND HOME PRACTICE; MIN/WEEK) AND LEVEL OF PA [METABOLIC EQUIVALENT (MET)-HOUR/WEEK] AT BASELINE, 2, 4 AND 6 MONTHS. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS AND NONPARAMETRIC TESTS WERE USED TO DESCRIBE THE SAMPLE AND EXAMINE DIFFERENCES BY GROUP AND TIME. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES BY GROUP ASSIGNED. PARTICIPANTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT PA CHANGES FROM BASELINE TO EACH MEASUREMENT POINT. THE DIRECT GUIDANCE OF AN INSTRUCTOR WAS PREFERRED OVER THE SELF-LEARNING METHOD. AT EACH TIME INTERVAL, THE DVD GROUP SHOWED HIGHER LEVELS OF PA THAN THE FACE-TO-FACE GROUP; THE ONLY DIFFERENCE THAT ACHIEVED STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE OCCURRED AT 4 MONTHS. THE PA LEVEL SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED OVER 6 MONTHS IN THE DVD GROUP, BUT NOT IN THE FACE-TO-FACE GROUP. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT A YOGA PROGRAM MAY BE UTILIZED AS A 'STEPPING-STONE' TOWARD REGULAR EXERCISE AMONG OVERWEIGHT SEDENTARY ADULTS. RESEARCH WITH A LARGER SAMPLE IS NEEDED TO FURTHER EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF THE PROGRAM ON THE LEVEL OF PA AMONG THIS POPULATION.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
8 2249  32 THE LIVED EXPERIENCE AND PATIENT-REPORTED BENEFITS OF YOGA PARTICIPATION IN AN INPATIENT BRAIN INJURY REHABILITATION SETTING. CONTEXT: THE MULTIFACTORIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA HAVE BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED IN THE LITERATURE, WITH THE INTEGRATION OF YOGA THERAPY INTO HEALTHCARE BEING AN EMERGING FIELD. IN GENERAL, YOGA THERAPY PROGRAMS ARE UTILIZED IN THE COMMUNITY AS AN ADJUNCT TO OTHER THERAPY. AT PRESENT, LIMITED REHABILITATION UNITS ROUTINELY INCORPORATE INTEGRATIVE THERAPY OPTIONS WITHIN A HOSPITAL ENVIRONMENT. AIMS: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXPLORE THE LIVED EXPERIENCE AND PATIENT-REPORTED BENEFITS OF YOGA IN AN INPATIENT BRAIN INJURY REHABILITATION SETTING. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: THIRTY-ONE PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED TO THE STUDY AFTER VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATING IN A YOGA CLASS WITHIN AN INPATIENT BRAIN INJURY REHABILITATION UNIT OF A MAJOR METROPOLITAN HOSPITAL. YOGA SESSIONS WERE HELD WEEKLY FOR 60 MIN AND CONSISTED OF A MODIFIED HATHA YOGA STYLE. THIS WAS A MIXED-METHODS, QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL ONE-GROUP PRETEST-POSTTEST STUDY. METHODOLOGY: QUANTITATIVE DATA WERE COLLECTED TO MEASURE PERCEPTIONS OF RELAXATION AND WELL-BEING BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA CLASSES, ALONG WITH THE SATISFACTION OF THE CLASS. SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE UTILIZED TO COLLECT QUALITATIVE DATA OF EXPERIENCES AND PERCEPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA PARTICIPATION. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: THEMATIC ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETED FOR QUALITATIVE DATA. QUANTITATIVE DATA WERE ANALYZED USING NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICAL METHODS, AND DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS WERE ALSO PROVIDED. RESULTS: THE BENEFITS DESCRIBED BY PARTICIPANTS ARE REPORTED IN THIS PAPER. THESE INCLUDE IMPROVED RELAXATION, PHYSICAL WELL-BEING, EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING, BEING PRESENT, AND SELF-AWARENESS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY DESCRIBES THE PERSONAL BENEFITS EXPERIENCED FROM REGULAR YOGA PARTICIPATION WITHIN AN INPATIENT REHABILITATION SETTING.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
9  144  29 A QUALITATIVE APPROACH EXPLORING THE ACCEPTABILITY OF YOGA FOR MINORITIES LIVING WITH ARTHRITIS: 'WHERE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE ME?' OBJECTIVES: TO EXAMINE THE ACCEPTABILITY OF YOGA RESEARCH TAILORED TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN A MINORITY POPULATION (BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH SPEAKING) WITH ARTHRITIS. YOGA RESEARCH FOR ARTHRITIS OFTEN UNDERREPRESENTS MINORITIES AND ACCEPTABILITY FOR THIS POPULATION HAS NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN INVESTIGATED. DESIGN: ACCEPTABILITY WAS EVALUATED USING RETENTION, ADHERENCE, JOURNALS, AND SEMI-STRUCTURED EXIT INTERVIEWS FROM TWELVE PARTICIPANTS WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS OR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS UNDERGOING AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. JOURNAL QUOTES WERE ANALYZED USING CONTENT ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES. NVIVO SOFTWARE WAS USED TO ORGANIZE TRANSCRIPTS AND ASSEMBLE THEMES. TWO METHODS OF TRIANGULATION (DATA AND INVESTIGATOR) WERE USED TO OVERCOME POTENTIAL BIAS FROM A SINGLE-PERSPECTIVE INTERPRETATION. EXIT INTERVIEW COMMENTS WERE CONTENT ANALYZED USING A CARD SORT METHOD. THE STUDY WAS DESIGNED WITH A CULTURAL INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING A MULTICULTURAL RESEARCH TEAM, TRANSLATORS, AND BILINGUAL MATERIALS AND CLASSES, TO FACILITATE TRUST AND ACCEPTABILITY FOR PRIMARILY HISPANIC AND BLACK/AFRICAN-AMERICAN ADULTS. SETTING: WASHINGTON, D.C. METROPOLITAN AREA, USA. RESULTS: ON AVERAGE PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED 10 OF 16 CLASSES, WITH HOME PRACTICE 2-3DAYS A WEEK. ALL WHO COMPLETED WERE STILL PRACTICING YOGA THREE-MONTHS LATER. QUALITATIVE NARRATIVE ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED MAJOR THEMES RELATED TO FACILITATING FACTORS AND BARRIERS FOR YOGA PRACTICE, SELF-EFFICACY, AND SUPPORT. PARTICIPANT COMMENTS INDICATED THAT OFFERING AN ARTHRITIS-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION AND USING A CULTURALLY CONGRUENT RESEARCH DESIGN WAS FOUND TO BE ACCEPTABLE. CONCLUSIONS: AS YOGA RESEARCH GROWS, THERE IS A NEED TO UNDERSTAND AND PROMOTE ACCEPTABILITY FOR TYPICALLY UNDER-REPRESENTED POPULATIONS. THIS STUDY ATTEMPTS TO INFORM THE EXPANSION OF MULTICULTURAL RESEARCH DESIGNED TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN THOSE FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
10 1250  30 FEASIBILITY STUDY: THE EFFECT OF THERAPEUTIC YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE IN CHILDREN HOSPITALIZED WITH CANCER. PURPOSE: TO DESCRIBE THE EFFECT OF THERAPEUTIC YOGA ON CHILD AND PARENTAL REPORTS OF QUALITY OF LIFE IN CHILDREN HOSPITALIZED WITH ONCOLOGICAL DIAGNOSES. METHODS: SIX CHILDREN PARTICIPATED IN 5 YOGA SESSIONS OVER 2 MONTHS. THE PEDSQL 4.0 WAS ADMINISTERED TO EACH CHILD AND PARTICIPATING PARENT/CAREGIVERS AT BASELINE AND AFTER COMPLETION OF THE YOGA INTERVENTION. THE WILCOXON NONPARAMETRIC RANK TEST MEASURED INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES OVER TIME. RESULTS: STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES (P < .05) WERE FOUND IN CHILD PERCEPTION OF GROSS MOTOR FUNCTION. CONCLUSION: THESE FEASIBILITY STUDY DATA SUGGEST THAT THERAPEUTIC YOGA POSITIVELY AFFECTED CHILD PERCEPTION OF GROSS MOTOR FUNCTION MEASURED ON THE PEDSQL 4.0.

BACKGROUND: SCHIZOPHRENIA IS A HIGHLY DISABLING ILLNESS. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN YOGA TO BE A FEASIBLE ADD-ON THERAPY IN SCHIZOPHRENIA. AIMS: THE CURRENT STUDY AIMED TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF YOGA AS AN ADD-ON TREATMENT IN OUTPATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: THE STUDY DONE AT A TERTIARY PSYCHIATRY CENTER USED A SINGLE BLIND RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED DESIGN WITH ACTIVE CONTROL AND WAITLIST GROUPS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CONSENTING PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA WERE RANDOMIZED INTO YOGA, EXERCISE, OR WAITLIST GROUP. THEY CONTINUED TO RECEIVE PHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPY THAT WAS UNCHANGED DURING THE STUDY. PATIENTS IN THE YOGA OR EXERCISE GROUP WERE OFFERED SUPERVISED DAILY PROCEDURES FOR ONE MONTH. ALL PATIENTS WERE ASSESSED BY A BLIND RATER AT THE START OF THE INTERVENTION AND AT THE END OF 4 MONTHS. RESULTS: KENDALL TAU, A NONPARAMETRIC STATISTICAL TEST, SHOWED THAT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE PATIENTS IN THE YOGA GROUP IMPROVED IN POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SYNDROME SCALE (PANSS) NEGATIVE AND TOTAL PANSS SCORES AS WELL AS SOCIAL FUNCTIONING SCORES COMPARED WITH THE EXERCISE AND WAITLIST GROUP. ODDS RATIO ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE LIKELIHOOD OF IMPROVEMENT IN YOGA GROUP IN TERMS OF NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS WAS ABOUT FIVE TIMES GREATER THAN EITHER THE EXERCISE OR WAITLIST GROUPS. CONCLUSION: IN SCHIZOPHRENIA PATIENTS WITH SEVERAL YEARS OF ILLNESS AND ON STABILIZED PHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPY, ONE-MONTH TRAINING FOLLOWED BY THREE MONTHS OF HOME PRACTICES OF YOGA AS AN ADD-ON TREATMENT OFFERED SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE OVER EXERCISE OR TREATMENT AS USUAL. YOGA HOLDS PROMISE AS A COMPLEMENTARY INTERVENTION IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
12  301  33 AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTS OF IYENGAR YOGA PRACTICE ON THE HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE OF PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RESPIRATORY DISEASES: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF AN IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM (IYP) ON PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC RESPIRATORY DISEASES. METHODS: PATIENTS ATTENDING LUNG TRANSPLANT CLINICS IN A TERTIARY INSTITUTION WERE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN A TWO-PHASE, 12-WEEK IYP THAT INCLUDED 2 H BIWEEKLY CLASSES. DOCTORS COMPLETED A FORMAL PHYSICAL AND CLINICAL ASSESSMENT ON CANDIDATES BEFORE ENROLLMENT. PATIENTS WITH NEW YORK ASSOCIATION CLASS III OR IV, OR DYSPNEA GRADE IV WERE EXCLUDED. AT BASELINE AND AT THE END OF 12-WEEKS, PATIENTS COMPLETED THE HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE (HADS), CHRONIC RESPIRATORY QUESTIONNAIRE (CRQ) AND HEALTH UTILITIES INDEX (HUI). MEDICATION(S), 6 MIN WALK TEST RESULTS AND OTHER CLINICAL PARAMETERS WERE ALSO RECORDED. PATIENTS RECORDED THE EFFECTS OF THE IYP ON THEIR DAILY LIVING IN JOURNALS. NONPARAMETRIC AND QUALITATIVE METHODS WERE USED TO ANALYZE THE DATA. RESULTS: TWENTY-FIVE PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION AND CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (MEAN AGE 60 YEARS) WERE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE. AT THE END OF THE 12-WEEK PERIOD, CHANGES IN HADS ANXIETY AND CRQ FATIGUE SCORES WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P<0.05) AND CHANGES IN HUI AMBULATION, PAIN, EMOTION AND OVERALL SCORE WERE CLINICALLY IMPORTANT. THE CONTENT OF THE JOURNALS REVEALED PATIENTS' IMPROVEMENT IN BREATHING CAPACITY, MOBILITY, ENERGY, SLEEP AND INCLUDED POSITIVE FEEDBACK SUCH AS: "INCREASED TIDAL VOLUME WITH SLOWING EXPIRATION", "I HAVE AN OVERALL FEELING OF WELLBEING" AND "EXCELLENT AMOUNT OF ENERGY". CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA HAS SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE BENEFITS. POTENTIAL BENEFITS WILL BE FURTHER EXPLORED IN A NATIONAL MULTISITE STUDY.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
13 2864  41 YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION FOR CAREGIVERS OF OUTPATIENTS WITH PSYCHOSIS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: THE USE OF YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR CAREGIVERS OF PATIENTS WITH PSYCHOSIS HAS BEEN POORLY STUDIED. THE CURRENT STUDY AIMED TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF A BRIEF YOGA PROGRAM AS AN INTERVENTION IN CAREGIVERS OF OUTPATIENTS WITH FUNCTIONAL PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS USING A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED RESEARCH DESIGN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CAREGIVERS WHO AGREED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY (N=29) WERE RANDOMIZED INTO YOGA (N=15) OR WAIT-LIST GROUP (N=14). THEY WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND AT THE END OF 3 MONTHS. PATIENTS WHO WERE RANDOMIZED INTO THE YOGA GROUP WERE OFFERED SUPERVISED YOGA TRAINING THRICE A WEEK FOR 4 WEEKS, AFTER WHICH THEY WERE INSTRUCTED TO PRACTICE AT HOME FOR THE NEXT 2 MONTHS. DUE TO THE SMALL SAMPLE SIZE AND SOME VARIABLES NOT BEING NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED, NON-PARAMETRIC STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS USED. RESULTS: RESULTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BURDEN SCORES AND IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE SCORES IN THE YOGA GROUP AS COMPARED TO THE WAIT-LIST GROUP AT THE END OF 3 MONTHS. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCORES IN CAREGIVERS, OR PSYCHOPATHOLOGY SCORES IN PATIENTS. CONCLUSION: IN CAREGIVERS OF OUTPATIENTS WITH FUNCTIONAL PSYCHOSIS, 4 WEEKS OF TRAINING FOLLOWED BY 3 MONTHS OF HOME PRACTICE OF A YOGA MODULE OFFERED SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE OVER WAITLIST. YOGA CAN BE OFFERED AS AN INTERVENTION FOR CAREGIVERS OF PATIENTS WITH SEVERE MENTAL DISORDERS. METHODS OF PROVIDING YOGA INTERVENTION CLOSER TO THE COMMUNITY OR USE OF FLEXIBLE MODULES AT HOSPITALS NEEDS FURTHER STUDY.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
14 1260  27 FINDINGS FROM A PROVIDER-LED, MINDFULNESS-BASED, INTERNET-STREAMED YOGA VIDEO ADDRESSING THE PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES OF A MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERNET-STREAMED YOGA VIDEO IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. A ONE-GROUP, REPEATED-MEASURES, PURPOSIVE SAMPLE USING A DIRECTED QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTIVE AND CONVERGENT MIXED-METHODS APPROACH WAS USED. PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED FROM BREAST ONCOLOGY PRACTICES ACROSS 2 SETTINGS IN THE NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES IN APRIL 2019. EDUCATION ABOUT THE VIDEO WAS PROVIDED, AND THE LINK TO THE VIDEO WAS SENT TO PARTICIPANTS. DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, KNOWING PARTICIPATION IN CHANGE SHORT FORM (KPCSF), SHORT WARWICK-EDINBURGH MENTAL WELL-BEING SCALE (WEMWBS), AND THE GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISTRESS SCALE (GAD-7) WERE OBTAINED AT BASELINE AND AT 2 AND 4 WEEKS. A SEMISTRUCTURED INTERVIEW WAS CONDUCTED AT 4 WEEKS. THIRTY-FIVE WOMEN (MEAN AGE = 56 YEARS) PARTICIPATED. A ONE-GROUP, REPEATED-MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE INDICATED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES OCCURRED IN ALL MEASURES BETWEEN WEEK 0 AND WEEK 4: DECREASED GAD (T = -2.97, P = .004), IMPROVED WEMWBS (T = 2.52, P = .008), AND INCREASED KPC (T = 2.99, P = .004).

15 1461  29 INFLUENCE OF YOGA ON MOOD STATES, DISTRESS, QUALITY OF LIFE AND IMMUNE OUTCOMES IN EARLY STAGE BREAST CANCER PATIENTS UNDERGOING SURGERY. CONTEXT: BREAST CANCER PATIENTS AWAITING SURGERY EXPERIENCE HEIGHTENED DISTRESS THAT COULD AFFECT POSTOPERATIVE OUTCOMES. AIMS: THE AIM OF OUR STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON MOOD STATES, TREATMENT-RELATED SYMPTOMS, QUALITY OF LIFE AND IMMUNE OUTCOMES IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS UNDERGOING SURGERY. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: NINETY-EIGHT RECENTLY DIAGNOSED STAGE II AND III BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WERE RECRUITED FOR A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA PROGRAM WITH SUPPORTIVE THERAPY PLUS EXERCISE REHABILITATION ON POSTOPERATIVE OUTCOMES FOLLOWING SURGERY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SUBJECTS WERE ASSESSED PRIOR TO SURGERY AND FOUR WEEKS THEREAFTER. PSYCHOMETRIC INSTRUMENTS WERE USED TO ASSESS SELF-REPORTED ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, TREATMENT-RELATED DISTRESS AND QUALITY OF LIFE. BLOOD SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED FOR ENUMERATION OF T LYMPHOCYTE SUBSETS (CD4 %, CD8 % AND NATURAL KILLER (NK) CELL % COUNTS) AND SERUM IMMUNOGLOBULINS (IGG, IGA AND IGM). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: WE USED ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE TO COMPARE INTERVENTIONS POSTOPERATIVELY. RESULTS: SIXTY-NINE PATIENTS CONTRIBUTED DATA TO THE CURRENT ANALYSIS (YOGA N = 33, CONTROL N = 36). THE RESULTS SUGGEST A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE STATE (P = 0.04) AND TRAIT (P = 0.004) OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION (P = 0.01), SYMPTOM SEVERITY (P = 0.01), DISTRESS (P < 0.01) AND IMPROVEMENT IN QUALITY OF LIFE (P = 0.01) IN THE YOGA GROUP AS COMPARED TO THE CONTROLS. THERE WAS ALSO A SIGNIFICANTLY LESSER DECREASE IN CD 56% (P = 0.02) AND LOWER LEVELS OF SERUM IGA (P = 0.001) IN THE YOGA GROUP AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS FOLLOWING SURGERY. CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS SUGGEST POSSIBLE BENEFITS FOR YOGA IN REDUCING POSTOPERATIVE DISTRESS AND PREVENTING IMMUNE SUPPRESSION FOLLOWING SURGERY.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
16 2367  32 WEEKLY ASSESSMENT OF NUMBER OF YOGA CLASSES AND AMOUNT OF YOGA HOME PRACTICE: AGREEMENT WITH DAILY DIARIES. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE A WEEKLY YOGA PRACTICE ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENT DESIGNED TO ASSESS NUMBER OF CLASSES ATTENDED IN THE PREVIOUS WEEK, NUMBER OF TIMES ENGAGED IN FORMAL HOME YOGA PRACTICE, TOTAL NUMBER OF MINUTES ENGAGED IN FORMAL HOME YOGA PRACTICE IN THE PAST WEEK, AND NUMBER OF TIMES ENGAGED IN INFORMAL HOME YOGA PRACTICE. "INFORMAL" PRACTICE WAS DEFINED AS "IN THE MIDDLE OF OTHER ACTIVITIES, YOU SPENT A FEW MOMENTS ENGAGED IN ASANAS/POSTURES, FOCUS ON BREATH, BODY AWARENESS, OR VERY BRIEF MEDITATION, FOR LESS THAN 5 MIN AT A TIME." WE ASSESSED AGREEMENT BETWEEN THIS WEEKLY ASSESSMENT AND A DAILY HOME PRACTICE LOG. DESIGN AND SETTING: SEVENTY-TWO COMMUNITY YOGA PRACTITIONERS COMPLETED ONLINE DAILY YOGA LOGS FOR 28 DAYS AS WELL AS THE WEEKLY YOGA PRACTICE ASSESSMENT FOUR TIMES OVER THE 28 DAY PERIOD. RESULTS: WE EXAMINED AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO METHODS ON THE FOUR INDICES OF AMOUNT OF WEEKLY YOGA PRACTICE. WE FOUND ACCEPTABLE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE TWO METHODS FOR NUMBER OF CLASSES, NUMBER OF TIMES ENGAGED IN FORMAL HOME PRACTICE, AND TOTAL NUMBER OF MINUTES ENGAGED IN FORMAL HOME PRACTICE. AGREEMENT WAS LOWER FOR NUMBER OF TIMES ENGAGED IN INFORMAL PRACTICE. CONCLUSIONS: THESE DATA PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR USE OF A WEEKLY YOGA PRACTICE ASSESSMENT TO ASSESS NUMBER OF CLASSES ATTENDED AND AMOUNT OF FORMAL BUT NOT INFORMAL HOME PRACTICE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
17 2695  27 YOGA INFLUENCES RECOVERY DURING INPATIENT REHABILITATION: A PILOT STUDY. PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ADD YOGA THERAPY TO INPATIENT REHABILITATION AND ASSESS WHETHER PATIENTS CHOSE TO ENGAGE IN YOGA THERAPY IN ADDITION TO OTHER DAILY THERAPIES, TO DESCRIBE PATIENTS' PERCEPTIONS OF HOW YOGA THERAPY INFLUENCED RECOVERY, AND TO ASSESS AND DESCRIBE PATIENT SATISFACTION WITH THE PROGRAM. METHODS: THIS WAS A SINGLE-ARM PILOT STUDY, ADDING YOGA THERAPY TO ONGOING INPATIENT REHABILITATION. YOGA THERAPY WAS OFFERED AS GROUP YOGA OR INDIVIDUAL YOGA TWICE A WEEK. SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW QUESTIONS WERE COMPLETED VIA TELEPHONE POST-DISCHARGE. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 55 OF THE 77 (71%) PEOPLE CONTACTED ABOUT THE STUDY ENGAGED IN YOGA THERAPY IN THE INPATIENT REHABILITATION SETTING FOR THIS STUDY AND 31 (56%) OF THESE COMPLETED THE SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW QUESTIONS. QUALITATIVE DATA SUPPORT THAT PARTICIPANTS PERCEIVED THAT YOGA THERAPY IMPROVED BREATHING, RELAXATION, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING. OVERALL, PARTICIPANTS WERE SATISFIED WITH THE PROGRAM, ALTHOUGH THEY OFTEN INDICATED THEY WOULD LIKE INCREASED FLEXIBILITY OR FREQUENCY OF YOGA. ALMOST ALL PARTICIPANTS (97%) SAID THEY WOULD RECOMMEND THE YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM TO OTHERS IN INPATIENT REHABILITATION. CONCLUSION: WE WERE ABLE TO ADD YOGA THERAPY TO ONGOING INPATIENT REHABILITATION AND PARTICIPANTS PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF HAVING THE YOGA THERAPY IN THEIR REHABILITATION STAY.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
18  135  22 A PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECTS OF ONE YOGA SESSION FOR SERVICE RECIPIENTS IN A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT PROGRAM. THIS WAS AN INVESTIGATION OF THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF A BRIEF YOGA INTERVENTION (ONE SESSION) WITHIN AN INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT PROGRAM (IOP) FOR SERVICE RECIPIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH VARIOUS PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS. PARTICIPANTS (N=26) COMPLETED THE TORONTO MINDFULNESS SCALE (TMS) AND THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECT SCHEDULE (PANAS). DATA WAS COLLECTED BEFORE AND AFTER ONE YOGA SESSION AND FOLLOW-UP DATA WAS COLLECTED VIA MAIL AFTER DISCHARGE FROM THE IOP. SCORES INDICATED THAT NEGATIVE AFFECT SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED AND POSITIVE AFFECT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FROM PRE TO POST YOGA SESSION. MINDFULNESS SCORES SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FROM PRE TO POST YOGA SESSION. THOUGH THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SUPPORTED THAT A YOGA INTERVENTION IS BOTH FEASIBLE AND EFFECTIVE WITHIN AN IOP, COLLECTION OF FOLLOW-UP DATA AFTER DISCHARGE VIA MAIL WAS NOT AS FEASIBLE. THE RESULTS OF THIS PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION SUPPORT A LARGER AND LONGITUDINAL STUDY TO FURTHER EXAMINE YOGA AS A TREATMENT MODALITY WITH THIS CLINICAL POPULATION.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
19   85  26 A MINDFUL YOGA INTERVENTION FOR CHILDREN WITH SEVERE ASTHMA: A PILOT STUDY. INTRODUCTION: CHILDREN WITH SEVERE ASTHMA MAY BENEFIT FROM NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT, YET LITTLE IS KNOWN REGARDING THE IMPACT OF MIND-BODY APPROACHES SUCH AS MINDFUL YOGA IN THIS POPULATION. THIS PILOT STUDY EXAMINED THE TOLERABILITY, FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY AND IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF A MINDFUL YOGA INTERVENTION IN CHILDREN WITH SEVERE ASTHMA. METHOD: FIFTEEN CHILDREN AGES 7-11 WITH SEVERE ASTHMA PARTICIPATED IN A SINGLE MINDFUL YOGA SESSION, FOLLOWED BY SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH THE CHILD AND CAREGIVER. VITAL SIGNS AND PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS WERE COLLECTED PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION. RESULTS: ALL CHILDREN REPORTED POSITIVE EXPERIENCES AND CAREGIVERS WERE GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE OF THEIR PARTICIPATION. ONE CHILD EXPERIENCED SELF-LIMITED BRONCHOCONSTRICTION WITH ASTHMA SYMPTOMS. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN LUNG FUNCTION OR VITAL SIGNS AFTER THE MINDFUL YOGA SESSION. DISCUSSION: OUR RESULTS WARRANT ADDITIONAL LARGER STUDIES TO EVALUATE THE SAFETY AND BENEFITS OF MINDFUL YOGA IN CHILDREN WITH SEVERE ASTHMA.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
20  724  37 EFFECT OF LAUGHTER YOGA ON MOOD AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY IN PATIENTS AWAITING ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION: A PILOT STUDY. CONTEXT: RESEARCH SHOWS THAT LAUGHTER HAS MYRIAD HEALTH BENEFITS, YET THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY HAS NOT IMPLEMENTED IT FORMALLY AS A TREATMENT. PATIENTS AWAITING ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION HAVE SIGNIFICANT PHYSICAL DISABILITIES AND ARE AT RISK FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. ATTENUATED HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) IS A RISK FACTOR FOR A NEGATIVE LONG-TERM OUTCOME IN SOME PATIENTS. OBJECTIVE: THE STUDY INTENDED TO EVALUATE THE CLINICAL UTILITY OF LAUGHTER YOGA IN IMPROVING PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES IN OUTPATIENTS AWAITING ORGAN TRANSPLANTATION. POSITIVE RESULTS WOULD INDICATE PROMISING AREAS TO PURSUE IN A FOLLOW-UP STUDY. DESIGN: SIX PARTICIPANTS MET FOR 10 SESSIONS OVER 4 WEEKS. THE RESEARCH TEAM MEASURED EACH PARTICIPANT'S HEART RATE, HRV, BLOOD PRESSURE (BP), AND IMMEDIATE MOOD BEFORE AND AFTER THE LAUGHTER AND CONTROL INTERVENTIONS. THE TEAM ASSESSED PARTICIPANTS' LONGER-TERM MOOD (ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION) AT THE STUDY'S INITIATION, AFTER A NO-TREATMENT CONTROL WEEK, AND AT THE END OF THE STUDY. SETTING: THE STUDY OCCURRED AT THE DEPARTMENT OF SURGERY AND MEDICINE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA HEALTH SCIENCES CENTER, TUCSON. PARTICIPANTS: PARTICIPANTS WERE PATIENTS AWAITING TRANSPLANTS (THREE HEART AND THREE LUNG), TWO WOMEN AND FOUR MEN (AGES 51-69 Y). PARTICIPANTS HAD RECEIVED NO MAJOR SURGERY IN THE 3 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE INTERVENTION, DID NOT HAVE A HERNIA OR UNCONTROLLED HYPERTENSION, AND DID NOT FALL INTO THE NEW YORK HEART ASSOCIATION FUNCTION CLASS 4. INTERVENTION: THE 20-MINUTE LAUGHTER INTERVENTION INVOLVED BREATHING AND STRETCHING EXERCISES, SIMULATED LAUGHTER (IE, UNCONDITIONAL LAUGHTER THAT IS NOT CONTINGENT ON THE ENVIRONMENT), CHANTING, CLAPPING, AND A MEDITATION. THE 20-MINUTE CONTROL INTERVENTION INVOLVED THE STUDY'S PERSONNEL DISCUSSING HEALTH AND STUDY-RELATED TOPICS WITH THE PARTICIPANTS. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE RESEARCH TEAM MEASURED BP, HEART RATE, AND HRV AND ADMINISTERED THE PROFILE OF MOOD STATES, BECK ANXIETY INVENTORY, AND BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY-II TO EVALUATE IMMEDIATE AND LONGER-TERM MOOD. THE TEAM HAD PLANNED QUANTITATIVE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE DATA AT THE STUDY'S INITIATION BUT DID NOT COMPLETE IT BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF ENROLLED PARTICIPANTS WAS TOO LOW FOR THE ANALYSIS TO BE MEANINGFUL. THE TEAM VISUALLY EXAMINED THE DATA, HOWEVER, FOR TRENDS THAT WOULD INDICATE AREAS TO EXAMINE FURTHER IN A FOLLOW-UP STUDY. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS SHOWED IMPROVED IMMEDIATE MOOD (VIGOR-ACTIVITY AND FRIENDLINESS) AND INCREASED HRV AFTER THE LAUGHTER INTERVENTION. BOTH THE LAUGHTER AND CONTROL INTERVENTIONS APPEARED TO IMPROVE LONGER-TERM ANXIETY. TWO PARTICIPANTS AWAITING A LUNG TRANSPLANT DROPPED OUT OF THE STUDY, AND NO ADVERSE EVENTS OCCURRED. CONCLUSION: THIS PILOT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT LAUGHTER YOGA MAY IMPROVE HRV AND SOME ASPECTS OF MOOD, AND THIS TOPIC WARRANTS FURTHER RESEARCH.	2012

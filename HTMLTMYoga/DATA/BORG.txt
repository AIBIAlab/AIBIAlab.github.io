1 2870 143 YOGA-BASED PULMONARY REHABILITATION FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF DYSPNEA IN COAL MINERS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: COAL MINE DUST EXPOSURE CAUSES CHRONIC AIRFLOW LIMITATION IN COAL MINERS RESULTING IN DYSPNEA, FATIGUE, AND EVENTUALLY CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD). YOGA CAN ALLEVIATE DYSPNEA IN COPD BY IMPROVING VENTILATORY MECHANICS, REDUCING CENTRAL NEURAL DRIVE, AND PARTIALLY RESTORING NEUROMECHANICAL COUPLING OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM. OBJECTIVES: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY (IAYT) IN THE MANAGEMENT OF DYSPNEA AND FATIGUE IN COAL MINERS WITH COPD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RANDOMIZED, WAITLIST CONTROLLED, SINGLE-BLIND CLINICAL TRIAL. EIGHTY-ONE COAL MINERS (36-60 YEARS) WITH STABLE STAGES II AND III COPD WERE RECRUITED. THE YOGA GROUP RECEIVED AN IAYT MODULE FOR COPD THAT INCLUDED ASANAS, LOOSENING EXERCISES, BREATHING PRACTICES, PRANAYAMA, CYCLIC MEDITATION, YOGIC COUNSELING AND LECTURES 90 MIN/DAY, 6 DAYS/WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS. MEASUREMENTS OF DYSPNEA AND FATIGUE ON THE BORG SCALE, EXERCISE CAPACITY BY THE 6 MIN WALK TEST, PERIPHERAL CAPILLARY OXYGEN SATURATION (SPO2%), AND PULSE RATE (PR) USING PULSE OXIMETRY WERE MADE BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION. RESULTS: STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT WITHIN GROUP REDUCTIONS IN DYSPNEA (P < 0.001), FATIGUE (P < 0.001) SCORES, PR (P < 0.001), AND SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN SPO2% (P < 0.001) AND 6 MIN WALK DISTANCE (P < 0.001) WERE OBSERVED IN THE YOGA GROUP; ALL EXCEPT THE LAST WERE SIGNIFICANT COMPARED TO CONTROLS (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS INDICATE THAT IAYT BENEFITS COAL MINERS WITH COPD, REDUCING DYSPNEA; FATIGUE AND PR, AND IMPROVING FUNCTIONAL PERFORMANCE AND PERIPHERAL CAPILLARY SPO2%. YOGA CAN NOW BE INCLUDED AS AN ADJUNCT TO CONVENTIONAL THERAPY FOR PULMONARY REHABILITATION PROGRAMS FOR COPD PATIENTS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
2 1112  37 EFFICACY AND TOLERABILITY OF YOGA BREATHING IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE: A PILOT STUDY. PURPOSE: YOGA-DERIVED BREATHING HAS BEEN REPORTED TO IMPROVE GAS EXCHANGE IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC HEART FAILURE AND IN PARTICIPANTS EXPOSED TO HIGH-ALTITUDE HYPOXIA. WE INVESTIGATED THE TOLERABILITY AND EFFECT OF YOGA BREATHING ON VENTILATORY PATTERN AND OXYGENATION IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD). METHODS: PATIENTS WITH COPD (N = 11, 3 WOMEN) WITHOUT PREVIOUS YOGA PRACTICE AND TAKING ONLY SHORT-ACTING BETA2-ADRENERGIC BLOCKING DRUGS WERE ENROLLED. VENTILATORY PATTERN AND OXYGEN SATURATION WERE MONITORED BY MEANS OF INDUCTIVE PLETHYSMOGRAPHY DURING 30-MINUTE SPONTANEOUS BREATHING AT REST (SB) AND DURING A 30-MINUTE YOGA LESSON (Y). DURING THE YOGA LESSON, THE PATIENTS WERE REQUESTED TO MOBILIZE IN SEQUENCE THE DIAPHRAGM, LOWER CHEST, AND UPPER CHEST ADOPTING A SLOWER AND DEEPER BREATHING. WE EVALUATED OXYGEN SATURATION (SAO2%), TIDAL VOLUME (VT), MINUTE VENTILATION (E), RESPIRATORY RATE (I>F), INSPIRATORY TIME, TOTAL BREATH TIME, FRACTIONAL INSPIRATORY TIME, AN INDEX OF THORACOABDOMINAL COORDINATION, AND AN INDEX OF RAPID SHALLOW BREATHING. CHANGES IN DYSPNEA DURING THE YOGA LESSON WERE ASSESSED WITH THE BORG SCALE. RESULTS: DURING THE YOGA LESSON, DATA SHOWED THE ADOPTION OF A DEEPER AND SLOWER BREATHING PATTERN (VTSB L 0.54[0.04], VTY L 0.74[0.08], P = .01; I>FSB 20.8[1.3], I>FY 13.8[0.2], P = .001) AND A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SAO2% WITH NO CHANGE IN E (SAO2%SB 91.5%[1.13], SAO2%Y 93.5%[0.99], P = .02; ESB L/MIN 11.2[1.1], EY L/MIN 10.2[0.9]). ALL THE PARTICIPANTS REPORTED TO BE COMFORTABLE DURING THE YOGA LESSON, WITH NO INCREASE IN DYSPNEA INDEX. CONCLUSION: WE CONCLUDE THAT SHORT-TERM TRAINING IN YOGA IS WELL TOLERATED AND INDUCES FAVORABLE RESPIRATORY CHANGES IN PATIENTS WITH COPD.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
3 1139  34 EFFICACY OF YOGA TRAINING IN CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE PATIENTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVES: TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF YOGA TRAINING IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD). METHOD: A LITERATURE SEARCH WAS PERFORMED IN PUBMED, COCHRANE LIBRARY, EMBASE, CINAHL, AND WEB OF SCIENCE FOR RELEVANT STUDIES PUBLISHED BEFORE JUNE 2017. QUALITY ASSESSMENT, SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS AND HETEROGENEITY WERE PERFORMED. STATA12.0 SOFTWARE WAS USED FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. RESULTS: TEN STUDIES WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS ANALYSIS. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN 6MWD (P = 0.000), BORG SCALE SCORES (P = 0.018), FEV1 VALUE (P = 0. 013), PACO2 (P = 0.037), SGRQ SCORES (P = 0. 000) AND CAT SCORES (P = 0.009) IN YOGA TRAINING PATIENTS. NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED IN THE FEV1/FVC (P = 0.75), FEV1 PREDICTED VALUE (P = 0.057) AND FVC (P = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: THIS META-ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT YOGA TRAINING CAN BE AN ACCEPTABLE AND APPROPRIATED ADJUNCTIVE REHABILITATION PROGRAM FOR COPD PATIENTS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
4  688  34 EFFECT OF ANTENATAL EXERCISES, INCLUDING YOGA, ON THE COURSE OF LABOR, DELIVERY AND PREGNANCY: A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY. BACKGROUND: DELIVERING A CHILD IS A VERY STRESSFUL EXPERIENCE FOR WOMEN. PREGNANCY AND LABOR ENTAIL COMPLEX EVENTS THAT ARE UNIQUE TO EACH INDIVIDUAL FEMALE. THE MANAGEMENT OF LABOR PAIN IS OFTEN DONE USING ANALGESICS AND ANESTHESIA, WHICH HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE SOME SIDE EFFECTS. MORE COMPREHENSIVE DATA ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE FOR CLINICIANS TO CONFIDENTLY PRESCRIBE EXERCISES TO PATIENTS. THIS STUDY WAS DONE TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF ANTENATAL EXERCISES, INCLUDING YOGA, ON THE COURSE OF LABOR, DELIVERY, AND PREGNANCY OUTCOMES. METHODS: A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AMONG 200 PRIMIPAROUS SUBJECTS (AGED 20-40). A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS PROVIDED TO THE SUBJECTS TO OBTAIN THEIR DEMOGRAPHIC AND OBSTETRICAL INFORMATION 6 WEEKS AFTER DELIVERY, AND THEIR HOSPITAL RECORDS WERE ALSO ASSESSED FOR FURTHER DETAILS. BASED ON THE NATURE AND DETAILS OBTAINED FOR THE ANTENATAL EXERCISES, SUBJECTS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: CONTROL AND EXERCISE. OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED THE NEED FOR LABOR INDUCTION, SELF-PERCEIVED PAIN AND PERCEIVED EXERTION DURING LABOR, DURATION AND NATURE OF THE DELIVERY, NEWBORN INFANT WEIGHT, MATERNAL WEIGHT GAIN, HISTORY OF BACK PAIN, AND POST-PARTUM RECOVERY. THE TOTAL MATERNAL WEIGHT GAIN (IN KILOGRAMS) WAS CALCULATED FROM WEIGHT AT 6 WEEKS AFTER DELIVERY MINUS THE WEIGHT AT 12-14 WEEKS OF GESTATION. BACK PAIN DURING PREGNANCY AND SELF-PERCEIVED LABOR PAIN WERE MEASURED USING A VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS). THE OVERALL PERCEIVED EXERTION DURING LABOR WAS MEASURED USING AN ADAPTED BORG SCALE FOR PERCEIVED EFFORT. RESULTS: THE SUBJECTS WHO FOLLOWED REGULAR ANTENATAL EXERCISES, INCLUDING YOGA, HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER RATES OF CESAREAN SECTION, LOWER WEIGHT GAIN, HIGHER NEWBORN INFANT WEIGHT, LOWER PAIN AND OVERALL DISCOMFORT DURING LABOR, LOWER BACK PAIN THROUGHOUT PREGNANCY, AND EARLIER POST-PARTUM RECOVERY COMPARED TO THOSE WHO DID NO SPECIFIC EXERCISES OR ONLY WALKED DURING PREGNANCY. CONCLUSIONS: THIS RETROSPECTIVE STUDY SHOWED THAT REGULAR ANTENATAL EXERCISES, INCLUDING YOGA, RESULT IN BETTER OUTCOMES RELATED TO THE COURSE OF LABOR, DELIVERY, AND PREGNANCY. THESE RESULTS NOTABLY INDICATED THAT PREGNANT WOMEN SHOULD BE ACTIVE THROUGHOUT PREGNANCY AND FOLLOW A SUPERVISED EXERCISE PROGRAM THAT INCLUDES YOGA UNLESS CONTRAINDICATED. WE REQUIRE FURTHER LARGE-SCALE PROSPECTIVE STUDIES AND QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL TRIALS TO CONFIRM THE OBSERVED FINDINGS.	2020	

5  173  49 A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY ON ASSESSMENT OF HEALTH STATUS, DEPRESSION, AND ANXIETY IN COAL MINERS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE FOLLOWING YOGA TRAINING. CONTEXT: PSYCHOLOGICAL COMORBIDITIES ARE PREVALENT IN COAL MINERS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD) AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE SEVERITY OF THE DISEASE REDUCING THEIR HEALTH STATUS. YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO ALLEVIATE DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY ASSOCIATED WITH OTHER CHRONIC DISEASES BUT IN COPD NOT BEEN FULLY INVESTIGATED. AIM: THIS STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE THE ROLE OF YOGA ON HEALTH STATUS, DEPRESSION, AND ANXIETY IN COAL MINERS WITH COPD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS WAS A RANDOMIZED TRIAL WITH TWO STUDY ARMS (YOGA AND CONTROL), WHICH ENROLLED 81 COAL MINERS, RANGING FROM 36 TO 60 YEARS WITH STAGE II AND III STABLE COPD. BOTH GROUPS WERE EITHER ON CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT OR COMBINATION OF CONVENTIONAL CARE WITH YOGA PROGRAM FOR 12 WEEKS. RESULTS: DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH STANDARDIZED QUESTIONNAIRES; COPD ASSESSMENT TEST, BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY AND STATE AND TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY AT THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF THE INTERVENTION. THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.001) IMPROVEMENTS ON ALL SCALES WITHIN THE GROUP, ALL SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT (P < 0.001) FROM CHANGES OBSERVED IN THE CONTROLS. NO SIGNIFICANT PREPOST CHANGES WERE OBSERVED IN THE CONTROL GROUP (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: YOGA PROGRAM LED TO GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH STATUS THAN DID CONVENTIONAL CARE. YOGA SEEMS TO BE A SAFE, FEASIBLE, AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH COPD. THERE IS A NEED TO CONDUCT MORE COMPREHENSIVE, HIGH-QUALITY, EVIDENCE-BASED STUDIES TO SHED LIGHT ON THE CURRENT UNDERSTANDING OF THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN THESE CHRONIC CONDITIONS AND IDENTIFY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
6 1101  41 EFFECTS OF YOGA TRAINING IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. INTRODUCTION: CURRENTLY, SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE ASSESSED THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON THE MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD), BUT THESE STUDIES INVOLVED A WIDE VARIATION OF SAMPLE AND CONVEY INCONCLUSIVE RESULTS. HENCE, THE PRESENT STUDY WAS PERFORMED A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA TRAINING IN COPD PATIENTS. METHODS: PUBMED, EMBASE, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, GOOGLE SCHOLAR, AND CLINICALTRIALS.GOV DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR RELEVANT STUDIES. THE PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN ONE SECOND (FEV1), FEV1% PREDICTED (% PRED). SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED 6-MIN WALKING DISTANCE (6 MWD), ARTERIAL OXYGEN TENSION (PAO2), AND ARTERIAL CARBON DIOXIDE TENSION (PACO2). WEIGHTED MEAN DIFFERENCES (WMDS) AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CIS) WERE CALCULATED, AND HETEROGENEITY WAS ASSESSED WITH THE I(2) TEST. RESULTS: FIVE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) INVOLVING 233 PATIENTS FULFILLED THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. YOGA TRAINING SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED FEV1 (WMD: 123.57 ML, 95% CI: 4.12-243, P=0.04), FEV1% PRED (WMD: 3.90%, 95% CI: 2.27-5.54, P<0.00001), AND 6 MWD (WMD: 38.84 M, 95% CI: 15.52-62.16, P=0.001). HOWEVER, YOGA TRAINING HAD NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON PAO2 (WMD: 1.29 MMHG, 95% CI: -1.21-3.78, P=0.31) AND PACO2 (WMD: -0.76 MMHG, 95% CI: -2.06-0.53, P=0.25). CONCLUSIONS: THE CURRENT LIMITED EVIDENCE SUGGESTED THAT YOGA TRAINING HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON IMPROVING LUNG FUNCTION AND EXERCISE CAPACITY AND COULD BE USED AS AN ADJUNCT PULMONARY REHABILITATION PROGRAM IN COPD PATIENTS. HOWEVER, FURTHER STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO SUBSTANTIATE OUR PRELIMINARY FINDINGS AND TO INVESTIGATE THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA TRAINING.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
7 2232  37 THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON INSPIRATORY MUSCLE PERFORMANCE IN VETERANS WITH COPD: A PILOT STUDY. CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD) CAUSES RESPIRATORY MUSCLE WEAKNESS THAT LEADS TO DISABLING DYSPNEA AND POOR FUNCTIONAL PERFORMANCE. THERAPIES ARE OFTEN GEARED TO IMPROVE INSPIRATORY MUSCLE PERFORMANCE. YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE EXERCISE CAPACITY, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND SOME PULMONARY FUNCTION MEASURES IN COPD, BUT LITTLE RESEARCH HAS EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA TRAINING ON INSPIRATORY MUSCLE PERFORMANCE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA TRAINING ON INSPIRATORY MUSCLE PERFORMANCE IN MILITARY VETERANS USING THE TEST OF INCREMENTAL RESPIRATORY ENDURANCE (TIRE). A PROSPECTIVE PILOT STUDY EXAMINED A 6-WEEK YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM CONSISTING OF ASANA (POSES) AND PRANAYAMA (CONTROLLED BREATHING). SUBJECTS HAD BASELINE INSPIRATORY MUSCLE WEAKNESS. THE TIRE MEASURED INSPIRATORY MUSCLE PERFORMANCE VIA THE PRO2 DEVICE, PROVIDING MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE, SUSTAINED MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE, AND INSPIRATORY DURATION. SECONDARY MEASURES INCLUDED 6-MINUTE WALK DISTANCE, ST. GEORGE RESPIRATORY QUESTIONNAIRE, HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE, AND SPIROMETRY. MEAN AGE AND BMI OF SUBJECTS WERE 67 +/- 3.6 YEARS AND 20.7 +/- 3.3, RESPECTIVELY. THE MAJORITY OF SUBJECTS HAD SEVERE (28.7%) OR VERY SEVERE (57.1%) COPD. STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVE M E N T S WERE SEEN IN MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE (39.0 +/- 14.1 CMH2O TO 56.4 +/- 20.6 CMH2O) AND SUSTAINED MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE (244.1 +/- 100.6 PTU TO 308.1 +/- 121.2 PTU). NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WE RE OBSERVED IN 6-MINUTE WALK DISTANCE, ST. GEORGE RESPIRATORY QUESTIONNAIRE, HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE, OR SPIROMETRY. YOGA TRAINING HAS THE POTENTIAL IN IMPROVE INSPIRATORY MUSCLE PERFORMANCE IN VETERANS WITH SEVERE TO VERY SEVERE COPD WHO PRESENT WITH INSPIRATORY MUSCLE WEAKNESS. THIS IS OF IMPORTANCE BECAUSE IMPROVING INSPIRA-TORY MUSCLE PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE COPD OUTCOMES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
8 2446  38 YOGA AND TAI CHI: A MIND-BODY APPROACH IN MANAGING RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS IN OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASES. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD) IS CHARACTERIZED BY AIRFLOW LIMITATION BECAUSE OF AIRWAY AND/OR ALVEOLAR ABNORMALITIES. SYMPTOMS INCLUDE DYSPNEA, COUGH, CHRONIC SPUTUM PRODUCTION. AS THE THIRD-RANKED CAUSE OF DEATH AS WELL AS DISABILITY-ADJUSTED LIFE YEARS (DALYS), IT POSES A SIGNIFICANT BURDEN ON PATIENTS, FAMILIES, HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND SOCIETY. REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS LINKED TO DECREASE IN MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY ASSOCIATED WITH COPD, BUT IMPLEMENTATION REMAINS CHALLENGING. THERE IS A NEED FOR COMMUNITY-BASED INTERVENTIONS THAT PROMOTE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. YOGA AND TAI CHI ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE IN THE COMMUNITY AND HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE BENEFICIAL IN PATIENTS WITH COPD AS WELL AS MANY OF THE CO-MORBID CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH COPD. RECENT FINDINGS: YOGA AND TAI CHI HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN USUAL CARE IN COPD WITH CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL IMPROVEMENTS IN 6-MIN WALK DISTANCE (6MWD), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1 S (FEV1), AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL). THEY HAVE ALSO BEEN FOUND TO BE COMPARABLE TO PULMONARY REHABILITATION INTERVENTIONS. SUMMARY: YOGA AND TAI CHI PROVIDE COMMUNITY-BASED OPTIONS FOR PATIENTS WITH COPD TO IMPROVE THEIR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND PULMONARY FUNCTION.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
9 1713  21 PERCEIVED EXERTION AND AFFECT FROM TAI CHI, YOGA, AND STRETCHING CLASSES FOR ELDERLY WOMEN. TAI CHI, YOGA, AND STRETCHING REGIMENS ARE GAINING POPULARITY AS ALTERNATIVES TO MORE TRADITIONAL EXERCISE, BUT THERE IS SCANT RESEARCH REGARDING PARTICIPANTS' PERCEIVED EXERTION AND AFFECTIVE RESPONSES TO THESE PRACTICES. WE COMPARED EXPERIENCED STATES OF PERCEIVED EXERTION, FEELINGS OF PLEASURE/DISPLEASURE, AND AROUSAL IN 70 ELDERLY WOMEN ENROLLED IN GROUPS OF TAI CHI ( N = 26), YOGA ( N = 25), OR STRETCHING ( N = 19) CLASSES. MEAN RATES OF PERCEIVED EXERTION, FEELINGS OF PLEASURE, AND AROUSAL RESPONSES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER OVER THE TIME COURSE OF ALL THREE GROUPS, WHILE THE OVERALL MEAN PERCEIVED EXERTION ( SOMEWHAT HARD ON THE BORG CR-10 SCALE) AND PLEASURE RESPONSES ( APPROXIMATELY VERY GOOD ON THE FEELING SCALE) WERE SIMILAR BETWEEN THEM. THE CIRCUMPLEX MODEL OF AFFECT SHOWED THAT CHANGES OCCURRED IN THE HIGH-ACTIVATION PLEASURE QUADRANT (ENERGY ON THE FELT AROUSAL SCALE). FROM A PRACTICAL PERSPECTIVE, THE EXERCISE INTENSITY AND AFFECTIVE RESPONSES ELICITED DURING THESE CLASSES MADE PARTICIPANTS FEEL GOOD AND INFUSED WITH ENERGY, LIKELY CREATING A POSITIVE MEMORY AND REINFORCING CONTINUED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PARTICIPATION.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
10  792  42 EFFECT OF YOGA IN CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE. YOGA IS ADJUNCTIVELY UTILIZED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN THE TREATMENT OF A VARIETY OF DISEASES, INCLUDING CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD), BUT THERE ARE NO STUDIES ASSESSING ITS ADJUNCTIVE EFFICACY IN THE UNITED STATES. WE PROSPECTIVELY EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA TRAINING ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AND THE PARAMETERS OF LUNG FUNCTION IN PATIENTS WITH COPD. THIRTY-THREE PATIENTS WITH DOCUMENTED COPD, PER GLOBAL INITIATIVE FOR OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE CRITERIA, WERE RECRUITED. ALL PATIENTS RECEIVED STANDARD COPD CARE. THE QOL WAS ASSESSED BY THE ST. GEORGE RESPIRATORY QUESTIONNAIRE. STANDARD SPIROMETRY AND MAXIMUM INSPIRATORY (MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE) AND EXPIRATORY PRESSURE (MAXIMAL EXPIRATORY PRESSURE) WERE MEASURED. PATIENTS WERE TAUGHT SELECTED YOGA EXERCISES INCLUDING BREATHING EXERCISES, MEDITATION, AND YOGA POSTURES FOR 1 HOUR, THRICE A WEEK FOR 6 WEEKS BY A CERTIFIED YOGA THERAPIST. THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND LUNG FUNCTION WERE AGAIN ASSESSED AT THE END OF 6 WEEKS. TWENTY-TWO PATIENTS COMPLETED THE STUDY. DIFFERENCES IN PREYOGA VERSUS POSTYOGA SCORES WERE EVALUATED USING PAIRED T-TESTS. STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS (P < 0.05) WERE OBSERVED FOR THE ST. GEORGE RESPIRATORY QUESTIONNAIRE [95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) 43.13-58.47], VITAL CAPACITY (95% CI 2.53-7.65), MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE (95% CI 6.62-23.64), AND MAXIMAL EXPIRATORY PRESSURE (95% CI 1.63-13.81). YOGA WHEN PRACTICED BY PATIENTS WITH COPD RESULTS IN IMPROVEMENT IN THE QOL AND LUNG FUNCTION ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE FINDINGS IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL AND IN THE LONGER TERM.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
11 2787  52 YOGA THERAPY DECREASES DYSPNEA-RELATED DISTRESS AND IMPROVES FUNCTIONAL PERFORMANCE IN PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: THERE HAS BEEN LIMITED STUDY OF YOGA TRAINING AS A COMPLEMENTARY EXERCISE STRATEGY TO MANAGE THE SYMPTOM OF DYSPNEA IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD). PURPOSE: THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE A YOGA PROGRAM FOR ITS SAFETY, FEASIBILITY, AND EFFICACY FOR DECREASING DYSPNEA INTENSITY (DI) AND DYSPNEA-RELATED DISTRESS (DD) IN OLDER ADULTS WITH COPD. METHODS: CLINICALLY STABLE PATIENTS WITH COPD (N = 29; AGE 69.9 +/- 9.5; FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1 SECOND (FEV(1)) 47.7 +/- 15.6% PREDICTED; FEMALE = 21) WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 12-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE WITH COPD OR USUAL-CARE CONTROL (UC). THE TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA PROGRAM INCLUDED ASANAS (YOGA POSTURES) AND VISAMA VRITTI PRANAYAMA (TIMED BREATHING). SAFETY MEASURE OUTCOMES INCLUDED HEART RATE, OXYGEN SATURATION, DYSPNEA, AND PAIN. FEASIBILITY WAS MEASURED BY PATIENT-REPORTED ENJOYMENT, DIFFICULTY, AND ADHERENCE TO YOGA SESSIONS. AT BASELINE AND AT 12 WEEKS, DI AND DD WERE MEASURED DURING INCREMENTAL CYCLE ERGOMETRY AND A 6-MINUTE WALK (6MW) TEST. SECONDARY EFFICACY OUTCOMES INCLUDED PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE, PSYCHOLOGIC WELL-BEING, AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL). RESULTS: YOGA TRAINING WAS SAFE AND FEASIBLE FOR PATIENTS WITH COPD. WHILE YOGA TRAINING HAD ONLY SMALL EFFECTS ON DI AFTER THE 6MW TEST (EFFECT SIZE [ES], 0.20; P = 0.60), THERE WERE GREATER REDUCTIONS IN DD IN THE YOGA GROUP COMPARED TO UC (ES, 0.67; P = 0.08). YOGA TRAINING ALSO IMPROVED 6MW DISTANCE (+71.7 +/- 21.8 FEET VERSUS -27.6 +/- 36.2 FEET; ES = 0.78, P = 0.04) AND SELF-REPORTED FUNCTIONAL PERFORMANCE (ES = 0.79, P = 0.04) COMPARED TO UC. THERE WERE SMALL POSITIVE CHANGES IN MUSCLE STRENGTH AND HRQOL. CONCLUSIONS: ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH COPD PARTICIPATED SAFELY IN A 12-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM ESPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR PATIENTS WITH THIS CHRONIC ILLNESS. AFTER THE PROGRAM, THE SUBJECTS TOLERATED MORE ACTIVITY WITH LESS DD AND IMPROVED THEIR FUNCTIONAL PERFORMANCE. THESE FINDINGS NEED TO BE CONFIRMED IN A LARGER, MORE SUFFICIENTLY POWERED EFFICACY STUDY.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
12  751  21 EFFECT OF SHORT TERM YOGA PRACTICE ON VENTILATORY FUNCTION TESTS. TWENTYFIVE NORMAL MALE VOLUNTEERS UNDERGOING A TEN WEEKS COURSE IN THE PRACTICE OF YOGA HAVE BEEN STUDIED BY SOME PARAMETERS OF VENTILATORY FUNCTIONS TESTS. THE OBSERVATIONS RECORDED AT THE END OF TEN WEEKS OF THE COURSE HAVE SHOWN IMPROVED VENTILATORY FUNCTIONS IN THE FORM OF LOWERED RESPIRATORY RATE, INCREASED FORCED VITAL CAPACITY, FEV1, MAXIMUM BREATHING CAPACITY AND BREATH HOLDING TIME, WHILE TIDAL VOLUME AND %FEV1, DID NOT REVEAL ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. THUS, A COMBINED PRACTICE OF YOGA SEEMS TO BE BENEFICIAL ON RESPIRATORY EFFICIENCY.	1988	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
13  865  34 EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICES ON PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS INCLUDING TRANSFER FACTOR OF LUNG FOR CARBON MONOXIDE (TLCO) IN ASTHMA PATIENTS. PRANA IS THE ENERGY, WHEN THE SELF-ENERGIZING FORCE EMBRACES THE BODY WITH EXTENSION AND EXPANSION AND CONTROL, IT IS PRANAYAMA. IT MAY AFFECT THE MILIEU AT THE BRONCHIOLES AND THE ALVEOLI PARTICULARLY AT THE ALVEOLO-CAPILLARY MEMBRANE TO FACILITATE DIFFUSION AND TRANSPORT OF GASES. IT MAY ALSO INCREASE OXYGENATION AT TISSUE LEVEL. AIM OF OUR STUDY IS TO COMPARE PULMONARY FUNCTIONS AND DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN PATIENTS OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA BEFORE AND AFTER YOGIC INTERVENTION OF 2 MONTHS. SIXTY STABLE ASTHMATIC-PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS I.E GROUP 1 (YOGA TRAINING GROUP) AND GROUP 2 (CONTROL GROUP). EACH GROUP INCLUDED THIRTY PATIENTS. LUNG FUNCTIONS WERE RECORDED ON ALL PATIENTS AT BASELINE, AND THEN AFTER TWO MONTHS. GROUP 1 SUBJECTS SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT (P<0.001) IN TRANSFER FACTOR OF THE LUNG FOR CARBON MONOXIDE (TLCO), FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1ST SEC (FEV1), PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR), MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION (MVV) AND SLOW VITAL CAPACITY (SVC) AFTER YOGA PRACTICE. QUALITY OF LIFE ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT PRANAYAMA & YOGA BREATHING AND STRETCHING POSTURES ARE USED TO INCREASE RESPIRATORY STAMINA, RELAX THE CHEST MUSCLES, EXPAND THE LUNGS, RAISE ENERGY LEVELS, AND CALM THE BODY.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
14 2006  50 STUDY OF THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE PATIENTS: A CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: PATIENTS OF CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD) ARE AT HIGH RISK FOR DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY. YOGA TECHNIQUES ARE SUITED FOR PROMOTING RELAXATION, PSYCHO-EMOTIONAL STABILITY AND EXERCISE TOLERANCE. STUDIES SHOWING THE EFFECT OF YOGA IN DIFFUSION CAPACITY ARE NOT AVAILABLE; HENCE THIS STUDY WAS PLANNED. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON 60 DIAGNOSED STABLE MILD-TO-MODERATE COPD PATIENTS IN THE AGE GROUP OF 30-60 YEARS, OF EITHER SEX, IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSIOLOGY. PATIENTS WERE TAKEN FROM GURU TEG BAHADUR HOSPITAL, DELHI AND DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: CONTROL AND THE YOGA GROUP. BOTH THE GROUPS WERE ON CONVENTIONAL DRUG THERAPY. SUBJECTS FROM THE YOGA GROUP WAS CALLED TO CARDIOPULMONARY LABORATORY DAILY FOR 21 DAYS AND THEN WEEKLY FOR THE COMPLIANCE. YOGA INSTRUCTOR TAUGHT THEM THE TECHNIQUE OF PRANAYAMA AND VARIOUS POSTURES EVERY DAY. THEY PRACTICED YOGA AT HOME FOR 2 MONTHS FOR 45 MIN IN THE MORNINGS. DIFFUSION CAPACITY WAS RECORDED BY USING COMPUTERIZED MEDISOFT INSTRUMENT (HYPAIR COMPACT), IN BOTH THE GROUPS BEFORE AND AFTER 2 MONTHS. RESULTS: STATISTICAL ANALYSIS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN TLCO OF THE YOGA GROUP. TRANSFER FACTOR OF LUNG FOR CARBON MONOXIDE I.E. TLCO IN MILD COPD INCREASED FROM 17.61 +/- 4.55 TO 19.08 +/- 5.09 ML/MMHG/MIN, AND IN MODERATE COPD IT INCREASED FROM 14.99 +/- 4.02 TO17.35 +/- 3.97 ML/MMHG/MIN. CONCLUSION: IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT YOGIC BREATHING EXERCISES IMPROVE DIFFUSION CAPACITY. THEY ARE BENEFICIAL TO COPD PATIENTS AND THEY CAN BE USED AS AN ADJUNCT THERAPY WITH THE CONVENTIONAL MEDICAL THERAPY.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
15 1881  30 REDUCED HYPOXIC VENTILATORY RESPONSE WITH PRESERVED BLOOD OXYGENATION IN YOGA TRAINEES AND HIMALAYAN BUDDHIST MONKS AT ALTITUDE: EVIDENCE OF A DIFFERENT ADAPTIVE STRATEGY? YOGA INDUCES LONG-TERM CHANGES IN RESPIRATORY FUNCTION AND CONTROL. WE TESTED WHETHER IT REPRESENTS A SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY FOR HIGH-ALTITUDE ADAPTATION. WE COMPARED VENTILATORY, CARDIOVASCULAR AND HEMATOLOGICAL PARAMETERS IN: 12 CAUCASIAN YOGA TRAINEES AND 12 CONTROL SEA-LEVEL RESIDENTS, AT BASELINE AND AFTER 2-WEEK EXPOSURE TO HIGH ALTITUDE (PYRAMID LABORATORY, NEPAL, 5,050 M), 38 ACTIVE LIFESTYLE HIGH-ALTITUDE NATIVES (SHERPAS) AND 13 CONTEMPLATIVE LIFESTYLE HIGH-ALTITUDE NATIVES WITH PRACTICE OF YOGA-LIKE RESPIRATORY EXERCISES (BUDDHIST MONKS) STUDIED AT 5,050 M. AT BASELINE, HYPOXIC VENTILATORY RESPONSE (HVR), RED BLOOD CELL COUNT AND HEMATOCRIT WERE LOWER IN CAUCASIAN YOGA TRAINEES THAN IN CONTROLS. AFTER 14 DAYS AT ALTITUDE, YOGA TRAINEES SHOWED SIMILAR OXYGEN SATURATION, BLOOD PRESSURE, RR INTERVAL COMPARED TO CONTROLS, BUT LOWER HVR (-0.44 +/- 0.08 VS. -0.98 +/- 0.21 L/MIN/M/%SAO(2), P < 0.05), MINUTE VENTILATION (8.3 +/- 0.9 VS. 10.8 +/- 1.6 L/MIN, P < 0.05), BREATHING RATE (INDICATING HIGHER VENTILATORY EFFICIENCY), AND LOWER RED BLOOD CELL COUNT, HEMOGLOBIN, HEMATOCRIT, ALBUMIN, ERYTHROPOIETIN AND SOLUBLE TRANSFERRIN RECEPTORS. HYPOXIC VENTILATORY RESPONSE IN MONKS WAS LOWER THAN IN SHERPAS (-0.23 +/- 0.05 VS. -0.63 +/- 0.09 L/MIN/M/%SAO(2), P < 0.05); VALUES WERE SIMILAR TO BASELINE DATA OF YOGA TRAINEES AND CAUCASIAN CONTROLS, RESPECTIVELY. RED BLOOD CELL COUNT AND HEMATOCRIT WERE LOWER IN MONKS AS COMPARED TO SHERPAS. IN CONCLUSION, CAUCASIAN SUBJECTS PRACTICING YOGA MAINTAIN A SATISFACTORY OXYGEN TRANSPORT AT HIGH ALTITUDE, WITH MINIMAL INCREASE IN VENTILATION AND WITH REDUCED HEMATOLOGICAL CHANGES, RESEMBLING HIMALAYAN NATIVES. RESPIRATORY ADAPTATIONS INDUCED BY THE PRACTICE OF YOGA MAY REPRESENT AN EFFICIENT STRATEGY TO COPE WITH ALTITUDE-INDUCED HYPOXIA.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
16  214  33 A STUDY OF THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA. THE ROLE OF YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES, AS AN ADJUNCT TREATMENT FOR BRONCHIAL ASTHMA IS WELL RECOGNIZED. ONE HUNDRED TWENTY PATIENTS OF ASTHMA WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS I.E GROUP A (YOGA TRAINING GROUP) AND GROUP B (CONTROL GROUP). EACH GROUP INCLUDED SIXTY PATIENTS. PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS WERE PERFORMED ON ALL THE PATIENTS AT BASELINE, AFTER 4 WEEKS AND THEN AFTER 8 WEEKS. MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS IN THE TWO GROUPS HAD MILD DISEASE (34 PATIENTS IN GROUP A AND 32 IN GROUP B). GROUP A SUBJECTS SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASING TREND (P < 0.01) IN % PREDICTED PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN THE FIRST SECOND (FEV1), FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), FORCED MID EXPIRATORY FLOW IN 0.25-0.75 SECONDS (FEF25-75) AND FEV1/FVC% RATIO AT 4 WEEKS AND 8 WEEKS AS COMPARED TO GROUP B. THUS, YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES USED ADJUNCTIVELY WITH STANDARD PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
17  438  28 CARDIOVASCULAR AND RESPIRATORY EFFECT OF YOGIC SLOW BREATHING IN THE YOGA BEGINNER: WHAT IS THE BEST APPROACH? SLOW BREATHING INCREASES CARDIAC-VAGAL BAROREFLEX SENSITIVITY (BRS), IMPROVES OXYGEN SATURATION, LOWERS BLOOD PRESSURE, AND REDUCES ANXIETY. WITHIN THE YOGA TRADITION SLOW BREATHING IS OFTEN PAIRED WITH A CONTRACTION OF THE GLOTTIS MUSCLES. THIS RESISTANCE BREATH "UJJAYI" IS PERFORMED AT VARIOUS RATES AND RATIOS OF INSPIRATION/EXPIRATION. TO TEST WHETHER UJJAYI HAD ADDITIONAL POSITIVE EFFECTS TO SLOW BREATHING, WE COMPARED BRS AND VENTILATORY CONTROL UNDER DIFFERENT BREATHING PATTERNS (EQUAL/UNEQUAL INSPIRATION/EXPIRATION AT 6 BREATH/MIN, WITH/WITHOUT UJJAYI), IN 17 YOGA-NAIVE YOUNG HEALTHY PARTICIPANTS. BRS INCREASED WITH SLOW BREATHING TECHNIQUES WITH OR WITHOUT EXPIRATORY UJJAYI (P < 0.05 OR HIGHER) EXCEPT WITH INSPIRATORY + EXPIRATORY UJJAYI. THE MAXIMAL INCREASE IN BRS AND DECREASE IN BLOOD PRESSURE WERE FOUND IN SLOW BREATHING WITH EQUAL INSPIRATION AND EXPIRATION. THIS CORRESPONDED WITH A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN OXYGEN SATURATION WITHOUT INCREASE IN HEART RATE AND VENTILATION. UJJAYI SHOWED SIMILAR INCREASE IN OXYGEN SATURATION BUT SLIGHTLY LESSER IMPROVEMENT IN BAROREFLEX SENSITIVITY WITH NO CHANGE IN BLOOD PRESSURE. THE SLOW BREATHING WITH EQUAL INSPIRATION AND EXPIRATION SEEMS THE BEST TECHNIQUE FOR IMPROVING BAROREFLEX SENSITIVITY IN YOGA-NAIVE SUBJECTS. THE EFFECTS OF UJJAYI SEEMS DEPENDENT ON INCREASED INTRATHORACIC PRESSURE THAT REQUIRES GREATER EFFORT THAN NORMAL SLOW BREATHING.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
18  741  25 EFFECT OF REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE ON RESPIRATORY REGULATION AND EXERCISE PERFORMANCE. YOGA ALTERS SPONTANEOUS RESPIRATORY REGULATION AND REDUCES HYPOXIC AND HYPERCAPNIC VENTILATORY RESPONSES. SINCE A LOWER VENTILATORY RESPONSE IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN IMPROVED ENDURANCE CAPACITY DURING WHOLE-BODY EXERCISE, WE TESTED WHETHER YOGIC SUBJECTS (YOGA) SHOW AN INCREASED ENDURANCE CAPACITY COMPARED TO MATCHED NON-YOGIC INDIVIDUALS (CON) WITH SIMILAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY LEVELS. RESTING VENTILATION, THE VENTILATORY RESPONSE TO HYPERCAPNIA, PASSIVE LEG MOVEMENT AND EXERCISE, AS WELL AS ENDURANCE PERFORMANCE WERE ASSESSED. YOGA (N = 9), COMPARED TO CONTROL (N = 6), HAD A HIGHER TIDAL VOLUME AT REST (0.7+/-0.2 VS. 0.5+/-0.1 L, P = 0.034) AND A REDUCED VENTILATORY RESPONSE TO HYPERCAPNIA (33+/-15 VS. 47+/-15 L.MIN(-1), P = 0.048). A YOGA SUBGROUP (N = 6) WITH MAXIMAL PERFORMANCE SIMILAR TO CONTROL SHOWED A BLUNTED VENTILATORY RESPONSE TO PASSIVE CYCLING (11+/-2 VS. 14+/-2 L.MIN(-1), P = 0.039) AND A TENDENCY TOWARDS LOWER EXERCISE VENTILATION (33+/-2 VS. 36+/-3 L.MIN(-1), P = 0.094) WHILE CYCLING ENDURANCE (YOGA: 17.3+/-3.3; CON: 19.6+/-8.5 MIN, P = 0.276) DID NOT DIFFER. THUS, YOGA PRACTICE WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED EXERCISE CAPACITY NOR WITH SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN EXERCISE VENTILATION DESPITE A SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT RESPIRATORY REGULATION AT REST AND IN RESPONSE TO HYPERCAPNIA AND PASSIVE LEG MOVEMENT.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
19  786  50 EFFECT OF YOGA BREATHING (PRANAYAMA) ON EXERCISE TOLERANCE IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE: A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: PULMONARY REHABILITATION IMPROVES EXERCISE TOLERANCE IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD). HOWEVER, MANY PATIENTS DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO PULMONARY REHABILITATION PROGRAMS. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT AN ALTERNATIVE TO PULMONARY REHABILITATION TO IMPROVE EXERCISE TOLERANCE IS THE PRACTICE OF PRANAYAMA, OR YOGA BREATHING, WHICH COULD BE DONE INDEPENDENTLY AT HOME. WE ALSO SOUGHT TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOGA NONPROFESSIONALS COULD ADEQUATELY TEACH PRANAYAMA TO PATIENTS. DESIGN: PROOF-OF-CONCEPT, RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE-BLIND, CONTROLLED PILOT TRIAL. SETTINGS/LOCATION: TWO ACADEMIC PULMONARY PRACTICES. SUBJECTS: FORTY-THREE PATIENTS WITH SYMPTOMATIC, MODERATE-TO-SEVERE COPD. INTERVENTIONS: TWELVE WEEKS OF PRANAYAMA PLUS EDUCATION VERSUS EDUCATION ALONE. TWO YOGA PROFESSIONALS TRAINED THE RESEARCH COORDINATORS TO CONDUCT ALL PRANAYAMA TEACHING AND MONITORED THE QUALITY OF THE TEACHING AND THE PRACTICE OF PRANAYAMA BY STUDY PARTICIPANTS. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS A CHANGE IN THE 6-MIN WALK DISTANCE (6MWD). SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED CHANGES IN LUNG FUNCTION, MARKERS OF OXIDATIVE STRESS AND SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION, AND MEASURES OF DYSPNEA AND QUALITY OF LIFE. RESULTS: THE 6MWD INCREASED IN THE PRANAYAMA GROUP (LEAST SQUARE MEAN [95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL] = 28 M [-5 TO 61]) AND DECREASED IN THE CONTROL GROUP (-15 M [-47 TO 16]), WITH A NEARLY SIGNIFICANT TREATMENT EFFECT (P = 0.06) IN FAVOR OF PRANAYAMA. PRANAYAMA ALSO RESULTED IN SMALL IMPROVEMENTS IN INSPIRATORY CAPACITY AND AIR TRAPPING. BOTH GROUPS HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN VARIOUS MEASURES OF SYMPTOMS, BUT NO OVERALL DIFFERENCES IN RESPIRATORY SYSTEM IMPEDANCE OR MARKERS OF OXIDATIVE STRESS OR SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION. CONCLUSION: THIS PILOT STUDY SUCCESSFULLY DEMONSTRATED THAT PRANAYAMA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED EXERCISE TOLERANCE IN PATIENTS WITH COPD. LAY PERSONNEL WERE ABLE TO ADEQUATELY TEACH PATIENTS TO PRACTICE PRANAYAMA. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT PRANAYAMA MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT CLINICAL BENEFITS FOR SYMPTOMATIC PATIENTS WITH COPD, A CONCEPT THAT NEEDS TO BE CONFIRMED IN FUTURE, LARGER CLINICAL TRIALS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
20 2662  47 YOGA IN BURN: ROLE OF PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISE ON PULMONARY FUNCTION, RESPIRATORY MUSCLE ACTIVITY AND EXERCISE TOLERANCE IN FULL-THICKNESS CIRCUMFERENTIAL BURNS OF THE CHEST. BACKGROUND: CIRCUMFERENTIAL BURN OF CHEST (CBC) IS A SIGNIFICANT TYPE OF BURN AND CONSIDERS AS A MAJOR CAUSE OF RESTRICTIVE LUNG DISEASE (RLD). PATIENT WHO HAS CBC WITH RLD LEADS TO RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS SUCH AS BREATHING DIFFICULTY, AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION, REDUCED EXERCISE CAPACITY AND ALTERED PULMONARY FUNCTIONS. HOWEVER, STUDIES EXAMINING THE ROLE OF PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISE ON PULMONARY FUNCTION, RESPIRATORY MUSCLE ACTIVITY AND EXERCISE TOLERANCE IN FULL THICKNESS CIRCUMFERENTIAL BURN OF CHEST ARE LACKING. OBJECTIVE: TO FIND THE SHORT TERM EFFECTS OF PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISE ON PULMONARY FUNCTION, RESPIRATORY MUSCLE ACTIVITY AND EXERCISE TOLERANCE IN FULL THICKNESS CIRCUMFERENTIAL BURNS OF CHEST. METHODS: THROUGH SIMPLE RANDOM SAMPLING METHOD THIRTY SUBJECTS (N = 30) WITH RLD FOLLOWING CBC WERE ALLOCATED TO PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISE GROUP (PBE-G; N = 15) AND CONVENTIONAL BREATHING EXERCISE GROUP (CBE-G; N = 15). THEY RECEIVED PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISE AND CONVENTIONAL BREATHING EXERCISE FOR 4 WEEKS RESPECTIVELY. ALL THE SUBJECTS RECEIVED CHEST MOBILITY EXERCISE AS COMMON TREATMENT. PRIMARY (NUMERIC PAIN RATING SCALE - NPRS, FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME (FEV1), FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC) AND MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION (MVV) AND SECONDARY (ELECTROMYOGRAM OF STERNOCLEIDOMASTOID, SCALENE, EXTERNAL INTERCOSTAL AND DIAPHRAGM MUSCLE, 6 MIN WALK TEST & GLOBAL RATING OF CHANGE - GRC) OUTCOME MEASURES WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE, AFTER FOUR WEEKS AND AFTER THREE MONTHS FOLLOW UP. RESULTS: BASELINE DEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL VARIABLES SHOW HOMOGENOUS DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN THE GROUPS (P > 0.05). FOUR WEEKS FOLLOWING DIFFERENT BREATHING EXERCISES, PBE-G GROUP SHOWS MORE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PAIN INTENSITY, PULMONARY FUNCTION, RESPIRATORY MUSCLE ACTIVITY, EXERCISE TOLERANCE AND GLOBAL RATING OF CHANGE THAN CBE-G GROUP (P </= 0.05) AT FOUR WEEKS AND THREE MONTHS FOLLOW UP. CONCLUSION: BOTH GROUPS SHOWED IMPROVEMENT OVER TIME. HOWEVER, DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GROUPS WERE NOTICED SMALL. STILL PHYSIOTHERAPY MANAGEMENT, WHICH INCLUDED PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISES WITH CHEST MOBILIZATION PROGRAM, HAD AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY IN THE TREATMENT OF RESTRICTIVE LUNG DISEASE FOLLOWING CIRCUMFERENTIAL BURN OF CHEST.	2021

1 1237 163 FEASIBILITY OF A BRIEF YOGA INTERVENTION FOR IMPROVING ACUTE PAIN AND DISTRESS POST GYNECOLOGIC SURGERY. BACKGROUND: WOMEN UNDERGOING SURGICAL PROCEDURES FOR SUSPECTED GYNECOLOGIC MALIGNANCIES FREQUENTLY EXPERIENCE PAIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS RELATED TO SURGERY. YOGA MAY REDUCE THESE NEGATIVE SURGICAL OUTCOMES. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF EVALUATING A PERIOPERATIVE BRIEF YOGA SKILLS TRAINING (YST) IN THIS POPULATION. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES WERE TO (1) ASSESS THE IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF THE YST ON PAIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS; AND (2) PROVIDE PRELIMINARY DATA FOR FUTURE STUDIES. METHOD: ADULT WOMEN SCHEDULED TO UNDERGO AN EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY FOR A SUSPECTED GYNECOLOGIC MALIGNANCY WERE RECRUITED TO THIS ONE-ARM FEASIBILITY STUDY. EACH WOMAN RECEIVED THE YST, WHICH CONSISTED OF THREE 15-MINUTE SESSIONS, ONE BEFORE AND TWO AFTER SURGERY. THE FOLLOWING CONSTRUCTS WERE ASSESSED: FEASIBILITY (RATES OF ACCRUAL, INTERVENTION ADHERENCE, MEASURE COMPLETION, RETENTION, AND LEVEL OF SATISFACTION), IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF THE YST (VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE RATINGS OF PAIN AND DISTRESS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND AFTER EACH SESSION), AND DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS FOR MEASURES TO BE USED IN FUTURE STUDIES. RESULTS: OF THE 33 ELIGIBLE WOMEN, 18 WERE APPROACHED AND 10 AGREED TO PARTICIPATE (MEAN AGE = 54.7 YEARS; 90% WHITE). TWO WOMEN DISCONTINUED THE STUDY PRIOR TO STARTING THE YST SESSIONS. OF THE EIGHT PARTICIPANTS WHO RECEIVED THE YST, FIVE COMPLETED THE PRE-SURGERY SESSION (63%) AND SEVEN COMPLETED (88%) BOTH POST-SURGICAL SESSIONS; ONE WOMAN WITHDREW AFTER ONE YST SESSION. PARTICIPANTS REPORTED HIGH SATISFACTION WITH THE YST. ACUTE PAIN AND DISTRESS DECREASED FROM BEFORE TO IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE YST SESSION WITH MODERATE TO LARGE EFFECTS: PAIN, D'S = -0.67 TO -0.95; DISTRESS, D'S = -0.66 TO -1.08. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATED REASONABLE INDICATORS OF FEASIBILITY. IN ADDITION, PATIENTS SHOWED SHORT-TERM REDUCTIONS IN PAIN AND DISTRESS. NEXT STEPS INCLUDE ATTENTION TO IMPROVING STAFF AVAILABILITY AND INTERVENTION IMPLEMENTATION IN ORDER TO FEASIBLY EVALUATE THE PERIOPERATIVE YST, WHICH SHOWS PROMISE FOR REDUCING POSTOPERATIVE PAIN AND DISTRESS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
2 1235  47 FEASIBILITY AND SAFETY OF INTRADIALYSIS YOGA AND EDUCATION IN MAINTENANCE HEMODIALYSIS PATIENTS. OBJECTIVE: PATIENTS WITH END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE ON MAINTENANCE HEMODIALYSIS ARE MUCH MORE SEDENTARY THAN HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY AND SAFETY OF A 12-WEEK INTRADIALYSIS YOGA INTERVENTION VERSUS A KIDNEY EDUCATION INTERVENTION ON THE PROMOTION OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. DESIGN AND METHODS: WE RANDOMIZED PARTICIPANTS BY DIALYSIS SHIFT TO EITHER 12-WEEK INTRADIALYSIS YOGA OR AN EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION. INTRADIALYSIS YOGA WAS PROVIDED BY YOGA TEACHERS TO PARTICIPANTS WHILE RECEIVING HEMODIALYSIS. PARTICIPANTS RECEIVING THE 12-WEEK EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION RECEIVED A MODIFICATION OF A PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM FOR PATIENTS WITH KIDNEY DISEASE (KIDNEY SCHOOL). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME FOR THIS STUDY WAS FEASIBILITY BASED ON RECRUITMENT AND ADHERENCE TO THE INTERVENTIONS AND SAFETY OF INTRADIALYSIS YOGA. SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF ADMINISTERING QUESTIONNAIRES AT BASELINE AND 12 WEEKS INCLUDING THE KIDNEY DISEASE-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE-36. RESULTS: AMONG 56 ELIGIBLE PATIENTS WHO APPROACHED FOR THE STUDY, 31 (55%) WERE INTERESTED AND CONSENTED TO PARTICIPATION, WITH 18 ASSIGNED TO INTRADIALYSIS YOGA AND 13 TO THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM. A TOTAL OF 5 PARTICIPANTS WITHDREW FROM THE PILOT STUDY, ALL FROM THE INTRADIALYSIS YOGA GROUP. TWO OF THESE PARTICIPANTS REPORTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN PARTICIPATION. THREE WITHDRAWN PARTICIPANTS SWITCHED DIALYSIS TIMES AND THEREFORE COULD NO LONGER RECEIVE INTRADIALYSIS YOGA. AS A RESULT, 13 OF 18 (72%) AND 13 OF 13 (100%) PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED 12-WEEK INTRADIALYSIS YOGA AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS, RESPECTIVELY. THERE WERE NO ADVERSE EVENTS RELATED TO INTRADIALYSIS YOGA. INTERVENTION PARTICIPANTS PRACTICED YOGA FOR A MEDIAN OF 21 SESSIONS (70% PARTICIPATION FREQUENCY), WITH 60% OF PARTICIPANTS PRACTICING AT LEAST 2 TIMES A WEEK. PARTICIPANTS IN THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM COMPLETED A MEDIAN OF 30 SESSIONS (83% PARTICIPATION FREQUENCY). OF PARTICIPANTS WHO COMPLETED THE STUDY (N = 26), BASELINE AND 12-WEEK QUESTIONNAIRES WERE OBTAINED FROM 85%. CONCLUSIONS: OUR PILOT STUDY OF 12-WEEK INTRADIALYSIS YOGA AND 12-WEEK EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION REACHED RECRUITMENT GOALS BUT WITH LESS THAN TARGETED COMPLETION AND ADHERENCE TO INTERVENTION RATES. THIS STUDY PROVIDED VALUABLE FEASIBILITY DATA TO INCREASE FOLLOW-UP AND ADHERENCE FOR FUTURE CLINICAL TRIALS TO COMPARE EFFICACY.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
3  551  45 CONVENIENT AND LIVE MOVEMENT (CALM) FOR WOMEN UNDERGOING BREAST CANCER TREATMENT: CHALLENGES AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INTERNET-BASED YOGA RESEARCH. OBJECTIVE: TO CONDUCT A PILOT TRIAL OF INTERNET-BASED, CANCER-ADAPTED YOGA FOR WOMEN RECEIVING BREAST CANCER TREATMENT. DESIGN: WOMEN UNDERGOING RADIATION OR CHEMOTHERAPY FOR BREAST CANCER WERE RECRUITED FOR 12, 75-MIN, BIWEEKLY, CANCER-ADAPTED YOGA CLASSES DELIVERED VIA INTERNET-BASED, MULTIPOINT VIDEOCONFERENCING. DATA WERE COLLECTED ON FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY, INCLUDING QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK FROM PARTICIPANTS AND THE YOGA INSTRUCTOR. RESULTS: AMONG 42 WOMEN APPROACHED, 13 DECLINED ELIGIBILITY SCREENING, AND 23 WERE INELIGIBLE. ALL 6 WOMEN WHO WERE ELIGIBLE PROVIDED CONSENT, BUT 2 WITHDREW PRIOR TO BEGINNING YOGA CLASSES. THE REMAINING 4 PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED 1-11 OF 12 ONLINE YOGA CLASSES. IN POST-INTERVENTION INTERVIEWS, PARTICIPANTS AND THE INSTRUCTOR AGREED THAT INTERNET-BASED YOGA CLASSES HOLD GREAT POTENTIAL FOR INCREASING ACCESS AND IMPROVING PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES IN ADULTS WITH CANCER. QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK FROM PARTICIPANTS REVEALED SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE TRIALS OF INTERNET-BASED, CANCER-ADAPTED YOGA CLASSES, INCLUDING: CONTINUED USE OF GROUP FORMAT; OFFERING MORE VARIED CLASS TIMES TO ACCOMMODATE PATIENTS' DEMANDING SCHEDULES AND FLUCTUATING SYMPTOMS; ENROLLING PATIENTS AFTER THEY HAVE ACCLIMATED TO OR COMPLETED CANCER TREATMENT; STREAMLINING THE TECHNOLOGY INTERFACE; AND CAREFUL ATTENTION TO PARTICIPANT BURDEN WHEN DESIGNING SURVEYS/FORMS. THE INSTRUCTOR RECOMMENDED CLOSED SESSION COURSES, AS OPPOSED TO ROLLING ENROLLMENT; TEACHING THE SAME MODIFIED POSES FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS, RATHER THAN INDIVIDUAL TAILORING; AND USING A LARGE SCREEN TO ALLOW CLOSER MONITORING OF STUDENTS' CLASS EXPERIENCE. CONCLUSIONS: INTERNET DELIVERY MAY INCREASE PATIENTS' ACCESS TO CANCER-ADAPTED YOGA CLASSES, BUT CANCER-RELATED AND TECHNOLOGICAL BARRIERS REMAIN. THIS STUDY INFORMS HOW TO OPTIMALLY DESIGN YOGA CLASSES, TECHNOLOGY, AND RESEARCH PROCEDURES TO MAXIMIZE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY IN FUTURE TRIALS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
4  694  36 EFFECT OF EISCHENS YOGA DURING RADIATION THERAPY ON PROSTATE CANCER PATIENT SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE: A RANDOMIZED PHASE II TRIAL. PURPOSE: A RANDOMIZED PHASE II STUDY WAS PERFORMED TO MEASURE THE POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF YOGA ON FATIGUE, ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION, URINARY INCONTINENCE, AND OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) IN PROSTATE CANCER (PCA) PATIENTS UNDERGOING EXTERNAL BEAM RADIATION THERAPY (RT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: THE PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA AND NO-YOGA COHORTS (1:1). TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA INTERVENTIONS WERE OFFERED THROUGHOUT THE 6- TO 9-WEEK COURSES OF RT. COMPARISONS OF STANDARDIZED ASSESSMENTS WERE PERFORMED BETWEEN THE 2 COHORTS FOR THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT OF FATIGUE AND THE SECONDARY ENDPOINTS OF ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION, URINARY INCONTINENCE, AND QOL BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER RT. RESULTS: FROM OCTOBER 2014 TO JANUARY 2016, 68 ELIGIBLE PCA PATIENTS UNDERWENT INFORMED CONSENT AND AGREED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY. OF THE 68 PATIENTS, 18 WITHDREW EARLY, MOSTLY BECAUSE OF TREATMENT SCHEDULE-RELATED TIME CONSTRAINTS, RESULTING IN 22 AND 28 PATIENTS IN THE YOGA AND NO-YOGA GROUPS, RESPECTIVELY. THROUGHOUT TREATMENT, THOSE IN THE YOGA ARM REPORTED LESS FATIGUE THAN THOSE IN THE CONTROL ARM, WITH GLOBAL FATIGUE, EFFECT OF FATIGUE, AND SEVERITY OF FATIGUE SUBSCALES SHOWING STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INTERACTIONS (P<.0001). THE SEXUAL HEALTH SCORES (INTERNATIONAL INDEX OF ERECTILE FUNCTION QUESTIONNAIRE) ALSO DISPLAYED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION (P=.0333). THE INTERNATIONAL PROSTATE SYMPTOM SCORE REVEALED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF TIME (P<.0001) BUT NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF TREATMENT (P=.1022). THE QOL MEASURES HAD MIXED RESULTS, WITH YOGA HAVING A SIGNIFICANT TIME BY TREATMENT EFFECT ON THE EMOTIONAL, PHYSICAL, AND SOCIAL SCORES BUT NOT ON FUNCTIONAL SCORES. CONCLUSIONS: A STRUCTURED YOGA INTERVENTION OF TWICE-WEEKLY CLASSES DURING A COURSE OF RT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PRE-EXISTING AND RT-RELATED FATIGUE AND URINARY AND SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION IN PCA PATIENTS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
5 2701  38 YOGA INTERVENTION FOR PATIENTS WITH PROSTATE CANCER UNDERGOING EXTERNAL BEAM RADIATION THERAPY: A PILOT FEASIBILITY STUDY. PURPOSE: STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED BENEFICIAL HEALTH EFFECTS FROM YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN CANCER PATIENTS, BUT PREDOMINANTLY IN BREAST CANCER. RESEARCH ON ITS ROLE IN ALLEVIATING PROSTATE CANCER (PC) PATIENTS' SIDE EFFECTS HAS BEEN LACKING. OUR PRIMARY GOAL WAS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF RECRUITING PC PATIENTS ON A CLINICAL TRIAL OF YOGA WHILE THEY UNDERWENT EXTERNAL BEAM RADIATION THERAPY (RT). METHODS: TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA INTERVENTIONS WERE OFFERED THROUGHOUT THE RT COURSE (6-9 WEEKS). BASELINE DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION WAS COLLECTED. FEASIBILITY WAS DECLARED IF 15 OF THE FIRST 75 ELIGIBLE PC PATIENTS APPROACHED (20%) WERE SUCCESSFULLY ACCRUED AND COMPLETED THE INTERVENTION. ADDITIONAL END POINTS INCLUDED STANDARDIZED ASSESSMENTS OF FATIGUE, ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION (ED), URINARY INCONTINENCE (UI), AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AT TIME POINTS BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER RT. RESULTS: BETWEEN MAY 2013 AND JUNE 2014, 68 ELIGIBLE PC PATIENTS WERE IDENTIFIED. 23 PATIENTS (34%) DECLINED, AND 45 (56%) CONSENTED TO THE STUDY. 18 (40%) WERE VOLUNTARILY WITHDRAWN DUE TO TREATMENT CONFLICTS. OF THE REMAINING 27, 12 (30%) PARTICIPATED IN >/=50% OF CLASSES, AND 15 (59%) WERE EVALUABLE. SEVERITY OF FATIGUE SCORES DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT VARIABILITY, WITH FATIGUE INCREASING BY WEEK 4, BUT THEN IMPROVING OVER THE COURSE OF TREATMENT (P = .008). ED, UI, AND GENERAL QOL SCORES DEMONSTRATED REASSURINGLY STABLE, ALBEIT NOT SIGNIFICANT TRENDS. CONCLUSIONS: A STRUCTURED YOGA INTERVENTION OF TWICE-WEEKLY CLASSES IS FEASIBLE FOR PC PATIENTS DURING A 6- TO 9-WEEK COURSE OF OUTPATIENT RADIOTHERAPY. PRELIMINARY RESULTS ARE PROMISING, SHOWING STABLE MEASUREMENTS IN FATIGUE, SEXUAL HEALTH, UI, AND GENERAL QOL.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
6  172  44 A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY OF YOGA SKILLS TRAINING VERSUS AN ATTENTION CONTROL DELIVERED DURING CHEMOTHERAPY ADMINISTRATION. CONTEXT: IT IS IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS FATIGUE AND CO-OCCURRING SYMPTOMS DURING CHEMOTHERAPY TO PRESERVE QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH GASTROINTESTINAL (GI) CANCER. OBJECTIVE: TO CONDUCT A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY OF A YOGA SKILLS TRAINING (YST) INTERVENTION COMPARED TO AN ATTENTION CONTROL (AC) AMONG ADULTS DIAGNOSED WITH GI CANCER. METHODS: YST CONSISTED OF FOUR 30-MINUTE SESSIONS DELIVERED INDIVIDUALLY DURING CHEMOTHERAPY PLUS HOME PRACTICE. AC PROVIDED EMPATHIC ATTENTION PLUS HOME DIARIES. PATIENT-REPORTED (PROMIS T-SCORE) ASSESSMENTS OF FATIGUE, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, SLEEP DISTURBANCES, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS (PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE) WERE COLLECTED AT CHEMOTHERAPY VISITS: BASELINE, WEEK 8, WEEK 10 AND WEEK 14, AND ANALYZED USING A MIXED EFFECTS MODEL. INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND WEEK 10. RESULTS: FORTY-FOUR OF 77 ADULTS APPROACHED AGREED TO PARTICIPATE (57%; YST N = 23; AC N = 21). PARTICIPANTS' MEAN AGE WAS 58 YEARS AND 48% WERE MEN. PARTICIPANTS RANDOMIZED TO YST REPORTED A LARGER DECLINE IN FATIGUE (-2.4 DIFFERENCE, D = 0.30) AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (-2.5 DIFFERENCE, D = 0.30) THAN AC PARTICIPANTS FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 10 AND SLEEP DISTURBANCES AT WEEK 8 (-3.9 DIFFERENCE, D = 0.50). DIFFERENCES IN MAGNITUDE OF CHANGE IN SYMPTOMS WERE CONSISTENT WITH OR EXCEEDED A MINIMALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE. PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS DECREASED MORE IN THE AC AT WEEK 10 (D = 0.30). REDUCTIONS IN INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES (IL-6, STNF R1) WERE LARGER IN THE YST GROUP THAN AC. CONCLUSION: YST SHOWED PROMISE FOR IMPROVING FATIGUE, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, SLEEP DISTURBANCES, AND INFLAMMATION. YST IS ALSO FEASIBLE AND REACHES PATIENTS UNDERREPRESENTED IN YOGA RESEARCH (I.E., GI CANCER, MEN), THUS WARRANTING FURTHER EXAMINATION.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
7 1942  38 SAFETY AND FEASIBILITY OF MODIFIED CHAIR-YOGA ON FUNCTIONAL OUTCOME AMONG ELDERLY AT RISK FOR FALLS. FALLS ARE AMONG THE MOST COMMON PROBLEMS AFFECTING OLDER ADULTS. AT LEAST 50% OF THOSE OVER THE AGE OF 80 FALL ANNUALLY. THE GOAL OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE SAFETY AND FEASIBILITY OF STRUCTURED YOGA IN AN ELDERLY POPULATION WITH FALL RISK. SENIORS AT RISK FOR FALLS WERE IDENTIFIED AND ENROLLED IN A SINGLE ARM PILOT TRIAL. A CHAIR BASED YOGA PROGRAM WAS PROVIDED TWICE A WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS. THE PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED FROM PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED PILOT DATA. A BATTERY OF VALIDATED INSTRUMENTS WAS ADMINISTERED AT BASELINE AND WEEK EIGHT AND WAS USED TO IDENTIFY WHICH INSTRUMENTS MAY BE SENSITIVE TO CHANGE AS A RESULT OF A YOGA PROGRAM. AMONG SIXTEEN SENIORS (MEDIAN AGE OF 88) WITH A PREVIOUS HISTORY OF FALLS, 87% PROVIDED DATA FOR ASSESSMENT AT THE END OF THE INTERVENTION. TWO PATIENTS WITHDREW, ONE DUE TO A FALL OUTSIDE THE INSTITUTION AND THE OTHER DUE TO LACK OF TIME AND INTEREST. THERE WERE NO ADVERSE EVENTS DURING THE YOGA SESSIONS. PAIRED-T TESTS COMPARED PRE-POST CHANGES AND GAINS WERE NOTED IN FEAR OF FALLING (5.27 TO 2.60; P = 0.029) AND SPPB SIT TO STAND SUBSCALE (0.31 TO 1.00; P =.022). IMPROVED TRENDS WERE NOTED IN ANXIETY AND THE TIMED UP AND GO ASSESSMENTS. WE FOUND THE MODIFIED CHAIR-YOGA PROGRAM IS SAFE AND RECRUITMENT IS FEASIBLE. OUR DATA SUGGESTS THAT YOGA MAY BE BENEFICIAL IN IMPROVING MOBILITY AND REDUCING FEAR OF FALLING WHICH WARRANTS ADDITIONAL RESEARCH VIA RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
8   41  57 A BRIEF YOGA INTERVENTION IMPLEMENTED DURING CHEMOTHERAPY: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVES: FATIGUE AND OTHER TREATMENT-RELATED SYMPTOMS (E.G., SLEEP DISTURBANCE) ARE CRITICAL TARGETS FOR IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY. YOGA MAY REDUCE THE BURDEN OF SUCH SYMPTOMS. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE FEASIBILITY OF CONDUCTING A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY OF A BRIEF YOGA INTERVENTION DURING CHEMOTHERAPY FOR COLORECTAL CANCER. DESIGN: WE RANDOMIZED ADULTS WITH COLORECTAL CANCER TO A BRIEF YOGA SKILLS TRAINING (YST) OR AN ATTENTION CONTROL (AC; EMPATHIC ATTENTION AND RECORDED EDUCATION). SETTING: THE INTERVENTIONS AND ASSESSMENTS WERE IMPLEMENTED INDIVIDUALLY IN THE CLINIC WHILE PATIENTS WERE IN THE CHAIR RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY. INTERVENTIONS: BOTH INTERVENTIONS CONSISTED OF THREE SESSIONS AND RECOMMENDED HOME PRACTICE. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS FEASIBILITY (ACCRUAL, RETENTION, ADHERENCE, DATA COLLECTION). SELF-REPORTED OUTCOMES (I.E., FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, QUALITY OF LIFE) AND INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS WERE ALSO DESCRIBED TO INFORM FUTURE STUDIES. RESULTS: OF 52 PATIENTS INITIALLY IDENTIFIED, 28 WERE APPROACHED, AND 15 ENROLLED (AGE MEAN = 57.5 YEARS; 80% WHITE; 60% MALE). REASONS FOR DECLINING PARTICIPATION WERE: NOT INTERESTED (N = 6), DID NOT PERCEIVE A NEED (N = 2), AND OTHER (N = 5). TWO PARTICIPANTS WERE LOST TO FOLLOW-UP IN EACH GROUP DUE TO TREATMENT CHANGES. THUS, 75% OF PARTICIPANTS WERE RETAINED IN THE YST AND 71% IN THE AC ARM. PARTICIPANTS RETAINED IN THE STUDY ADHERED TO 97% OF THE IN-PERSON INTERVENTION SESSIONS AND COMPLETED ALL QUESTIONNAIRES. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATED THE FEASIBILITY OF CONDUCTING A LARGER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL TO ASSESS YST AMONG PATIENTS RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY FOR COLORECTAL CANCER. DATA COLLECTED AND CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED WILL INFORM FUTURE RESEARCH.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
9  312  43 AN EXPLORATORY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF A 12-WEEK YOGA VERSUS EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME: FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY. OBJECTIVES: THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF THIS PILOT TRIAL WERE TO ASSESS THE STUDY FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF THE 12-WEEK YOGA AND EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAMS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS) IN PREPARATION FOR A FUTURE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS PILOT, PARALLEL-ARM, RANDOMIZED FEASIBILITY TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED AT TWO SITES, MORGANTOWN, WV AND COLUMBUS, OH. YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED 75-MIN IYENGAR YOGA CLASSES, TWICE WEEKLY FOR 4 WEEKS, THEN ONCE A WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS (16 TOTAL CLASSES), AND COMPLETED A 30-MIN HOMEWORK ROUTINE ON NONCLASS DAYS. EDUCATIONAL FILM GROUP PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED ONCE WEEKLY, 75-MIN CLASSES (12 TOTAL CLASSES), WHICH INCLUDED INFORMATION ON RLS AND OTHER SLEEP DISORDERS, RLS MANAGEMENT INCLUDING SLEEP HYGIENE PRACTICES, AND COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES. FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OUTCOMES INCLUDED PROGRAM SATISFACTION AND RECRUITMENT, RETENTION, AND ADHERENCE RATES. IN ADDITION, PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED THEIR PREFERENCES REGARDING THREE YOGA CLASS SCHEDULE SCENARIOS FOR A FUTURE STUDY. ATTENDANCE, YOGA, AND TREATMENT LOGS WERE COLLECTED WEEKLY. PROGRAM EVALUATION AND YOGA SCHEDULING QUESTIONNAIRES WERE COLLECTED AT WEEK 12. RESULTS: FORTY-ONE ADULTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE RLS WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 12-WEEK YOGA (N = 19) OR EDUCATIONAL FILM (N = 22) PROGRAM. THIRTY PARTICIPANTS (73%) COMPLETED THE PROGRAM. YOGA AND EDUCATION GROUP PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED AN AVERAGE OF 13.0 +/- 0.84 (81%) AND 10.3 +/- 0.3 CLASSES (85%), RESPECTIVELY. PARTICIPANTS FROM BOTH GROUPS INDICATED SATISFACTION WITH THE STUDY. ALL YOGA GROUP RESPONDENTS TO THE PROGRAM EVALUATION REPORTED THEY WOULD LIKELY (N = 6) OR VERY LIKELY (N = 7) CONTINUE YOGA PRACTICE; 86.7% OF EDUCATION GROUP RESPONDENTS (13 OF 15) INDICATED THAT THEY WERE LIKELY (N = 7) OR VERY LIKELY (N = 6) TO MAKE LASTING CHANGES BASED ON WHAT THEY HAD LEARNED. THE PREFERRED SCHEDULE FOR A FUTURE STUDY WAS A 16-WEEK STUDY WITH ONCE-WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES. CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT A LARGER RCT COMPARING YOGA WITH AN EDUCATIONAL FILM GROUP FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RLS IS FEASIBLE.

10 1207  37 EXPERIENCES OF WOMEN WHO PARTICIPATED IN A BETA-TEST FOR AN ONLINE-STREAMED YOGA INTERVENTION AFTER A STILLBIRTH. BACKGROUND: LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW TO BEST CARE FOR MOTHERS AFTER STILLBIRTH. AS SUCH, THIS PAPER WILL REPORT THE SATISFACTION AND PERCEPTIONS OF AN ONLINE YOGA INTERVENTION (12-WEEK BETA TEST) IN WOMEN AFTER STILLBIRTH. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS (N=74) HAD A STILLBIRTH WITHIN THE LAST 24-MONTHS (M TIME SINCE LOSS 9.65 +/- 6.9 MONTHS). POST-INTERVENTION SATISFACTION SURVEYS AND INTERVIEWS AND DROPOUT SURVEYS WERE CONDUCTED. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS WERE USED TO ANALYZE SURVEY RESPONSES AND DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION. A PHENOMENOLOGICAL APPROACH WAS USED TO EXPLORE AND UNDERSTAND UNIQUE EXPERIENCES OF PARTICIPANT INTERVIEWS. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING NVIVO10. RESULTS: TWENTY-SIX WOMEN (M AGE 33.73 +/- 4.38) WERE COMPLETERS (> 3 WKS OF YOGA), 26 (M AGE 31.82 +/- 4.13) WERE NON-COMPLETERS (< 3 WKS OF YOGA), AND 22 (M AGE 32.94 +/- 2.93) DROPPED OUT. TWENTY COMPLETERS PARTICIPATED IN A POST-INTERVENTION SATISFACTION SURVEY WITH 75% (N=15) REPORTING BEING VERY SATISFIED OR SATISFIED WITH THE ONLINE YOGA INTERVENTION, FOUND IT TO BE VERY ENJOYABLE OR ENJOYABLE, AND VERY HELPFUL OR HELPFUL TO COPE WITH GRIEF. SATISFACTION AND PERCEPTIONS OF THE INTERVENTION IN THOSE WHO COMPLETED AN INTERVIEW (N=12) WERE CLUSTERED AROUND THE FOLLOWING THEMES: BENEFITS, BARRIERS, DISLIKES, SATISFACTION, AND PREFERENCES. OF THE 22 DROPOUTS, 14 COMPLETED A DROPOUT SURVEY. WOMEN WITHDREW FROM THE STUDY DUE TO PREGNANCY (N=3, 21%), BURDEN (N=3, 21%), STRESS (N=2, 14%), LACK OF TIME (N=2, 14%), DID NOT ENJOY (N=1, 7%), AND OTHER (N=3, 21%). CONCLUSION: FINDINGS HERE MAY BE USED TO HELP DESIGN FUTURE RESEARCH.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
11 1497  51 INTRADIALYTIC LAUGHTER YOGA THERAPY FOR HAEMODIALYSIS PATIENTS: A PRE-POST INTERVENTION FEASIBILITY STUDY. BACKGROUND: LAUGHTER YOGA CONSISTS OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE, RELAXATION TECHNIQUES AND SIMULATED VIGOROUS LAUGHTER. IT HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFITS FOR PEOPLE IN DIVERSE CLINICAL AND NON-CLINICAL SETTINGS, BUT HAS NOT YET BEEN TESTED IN A HAEMODIALYSIS SETTING. THE STUDY HAD THREE AIMS: 1) TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF CONDUCTING LAUGHTER YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH END STAGE KIDNEY DISEASE IN A DIALYSIS SETTING; 2) TO EXPLORE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL IMPACT OF LAUGHTER YOGA FOR THESE PATIENTS; AND 3) TO ESTIMATE THE SAMPLE SIZE REQUIRED FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. METHODS: PRE/POST INTERVENTION FEASIBILITY STUDY. EIGHTEEN PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED INTO THE STUDY AND LAUGHTER YOGA THERAPISTS PROVIDED A FOUR WEEK INTRADIALYTIC PROGRAM (30-MIN INTERVENTION THREE TIMES PER WEEK). PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE PSYCHOLOGICAL ITEMS MEASURED AT THE FIRST AND LAST LAUGHTER YOGA SESSION, INCLUDING: QUALITY OF LIFE; SUBJECTIVE WELLBEING; MOOD; OPTIMISM; CONTROL; SELF-ESTEEM; DEPRESSION, ANXIETY AND STRESS. SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE: BLOOD PRESSURE, INTRADIALYTIC HYPOTENSIVE EPISODES AND LUNG FUNCTION (FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME). DIALYSIS NURSES EXPOSED TO THE INTERVENTION COMPLETED A LAUGHTER YOGA ATTITUDES AND PERCEPTIONS SURVEY (N = 11). DATA WERE ANALYSED USING IBM SPSS STATISTICS V22, INCLUDING DESCRIPTIVE AND INFERENTIAL STATISTICS, AND SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATES WERE CALCULATED USING G*POWER. RESULTS: ONE PARTICIPANT WITHDREW FROM THE STUDY FOR MEDICAL REASONS THAT WERE UNRELATED TO THE STUDY DURING THE FIRST WEEK (94 % RETENTION RATE). THERE WERE NON-SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN HAPPINESS, MOOD, AND OPTIMISM AND A DECREASE IN STRESS. EPISODES OF INTRADIALYTIC HYPOTENSION DECREASED FROM 19 PRE AND 19 DURING LAUGHTER YOGA TO 4 POST LAUGHTER YOGA. THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN LUNG FUNCTION OR BLOOD PRESSURE. ALL NURSES AGREED OR STRONGLY AGREED THAT LAUGHTER YOGA HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON PATIENTS' MOOD, IT WAS A FEASIBLE INTERVENTION AND THEY WOULD RECOMMEND LAUGHTER YOGA TO THEIR PATIENTS. SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH INDICATED THAT A MINIMUM OF 207 PARTICIPANTS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT POWER TO DETECT CHANGE IN KEY PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIABLES. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT LAUGHTER YOGA IS A SAFE, LOW-INTENSITY FORM OF INTRADIALYTIC PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THAT CAN BE SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED FOR PATIENTS IN DIALYSIS SETTINGS. LARGER STUDIES ARE REQUIRED, HOWEVER, TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF LAUGHTER YOGA ON KEY PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIABLES.

12 2012  43 SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA PROGRAM IN POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER: A FEASIBILITY STUDY. BACKGROUND: SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA (SKY), A BREATH-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION, HAS DEMONSTRATED SAFETY AND EFFICACY IN POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) PATIENTS SUBSEQUENT TO NATURAL DISASTER OR WAR, BUT HAS NOT BEEN EXPLORED IN CIVILIANS WITH PTSD FROM A WIDER RANGE OF TRAUMA. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT IT WOULD BE FEASIBLE TO CONDUCT A CLINICAL TRIAL OF SKY IN PTSD RESULTING FROM A WIDE RANGE OF TRAUMA. METHODS: OUTCOMES WERE FEASIBILITY MEASURES INCLUDING RATES OF ENROLLMENT AND RETENTION, ADHERENCE TO STUDY PROTOCOL; AS WELL AS CHANGES IN PTSD SYMPTOMS, OTHER MOOD SYMPTOMS, AND PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES. MALE AND FEMALE PARTICIPANTS AGED 18-75 YEARS WERE ENROLLED IN A FEASIBILITY TRIAL. THEY ATTENDED A 6-DAY LEARNING PHASE OF SKY FOLLOWED BY 7 SESSIONS OVER 11 WEEKS AS AN ADJUNCT TO THEIR USUAL TREATMENT. RESULTS: FORTY-SEVEN PARTICIPANTS WERE SCREENED AND 32 WERE ENROLLED OVER 9 MONTHS. CONSISTENT WITH RETENTION RATES OF OTHER PTSD TRIALS, 13 WITHDREW FROM THE STUDY PRIOR TO WEEK 12. TWENTY-ONE PARTICIPANTS MET INTERVENTION ATTENDANCE REQUIREMENTS, COMPLETED 95% OF PLANNED STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND WERE INCLUDED IN FINAL ANALYSES. PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCED CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN PTSD SYMPTOMS ON THE POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER CHECKLIST (PCL-5) SCORES AT WEEK 12 MEAN DIFFERENCE, MDIFF (STANDARD DEVIATION [SD]) = -10.68 (14.03), P = 0.004; COHEN'S D = 0.58, WHICH WAS SUSTAINED AT WEEK 24 MDIFF (SD) = -16.11 (15.20), P < 0.001; COHEN'S D = 0.91. CONCLUSIONS: IT IS POSSIBLE TO CONDUCT A CLINICAL TRIAL OF SKY IN A ROUTINE PSYCHIATRY CLINIC SERVING PATIENTS WITH PTSD DUE TO A WIDE RANGE OF TRAUMA. FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD INCLUDE AN RCT DESIGN.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
13 1228  35 FEASIBILITY AND IMPACT OF A YOGA INTERVENTION ON COGNITION, PHYSICAL FUNCTION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND AFFECTIVE OUTCOMES AMONG PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT TRIAL. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IS TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY AND IMPACT OF A TRIWEEKLY 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION AMONG PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV (PLWH). ADDITIONAL OBJECTIVES INCLUDED EVALUATING COGNITION, PHYSICAL FUNCTION, MEDICATION ADHERENCE, HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL), AND MENTAL HEALTH AMONG YOGA PARTICIPANTS VERSUS CONTROLS USING BLINDED ASSESSORS. WE RECRUITED 22 MEDICALLY STABLE PLWH AGED >/=35 YEARS. A PRIORI FEASIBILITY CRITERIA WERE >/=70% YOGA SESSION ATTENDANCE AND >/=70% OF PARTICIPANTS SATISFIED WITH THE INTERVENTION USING A POSTPARTICIPATION QUESTIONNAIRE. TWO PARTICIPANTS WITHDREW FROM THE YOGA GROUP. MEAN YOGA CLASS ATTENDANCE WAS 82%, WITH 100% SATISFACTION. INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSES (YOGA N = 11, CONTROL N = 11) SHOWED NO WITHIN- OR BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCES IN COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION. THE YOGA GROUP IMPROVED OVER TIME IN HRQOL COGNITION (P = .047) WITH TRENDS TOWARD IMPROVEMENTS IN HRQOL HEALTH TRANSITION (P =.063) AND DEPRESSION (P = .055).

14  258  42 ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF A 12-WEEK YOGA VS. EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS): STUDY PROTOCOL FOR A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS) IS A COMMON AND BURDENSOME SLEEP DISORDER ASSOCIATED WITH PROFOUND IMPAIRMENT OF HEALTH, WELL-BEING, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. UNFORTUNATELY, THE MEDICATIONS USED FOR RLS MANAGEMENT CARRY RISK OF SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS, INCLUDING AUGMENTATION OF SYMPTOMS. YOGA, AN ANCIENT MIND-BODY DISCIPLINE DESIGNED TO PROMOTE PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, AND MENTAL WELL-BEING, MAY OFFER A VIABLE, LOW-RISK NEW TREATMENT. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF THIS PILOT, PARALLEL-ARM, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) ARE TO ASSESS THE ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF A 12-WEEK YOGA VS. EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RLS. METHODS: FORTY-FOUR ADULTS WITH CONFIRMED MODERATE TO SEVERE RLS WILL BE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED TO A 12-WEEK YOGA (N = 22) OR STANDARDIZED EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM (N = 22). YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS WILL ATTEND TWO 75-MIN IYENGAR YOGA CLASSES PER WEEK FOR THE FIRST 4 WEEKS, THEN ONE 75-MIN CLASS PER WEEK FOR THE REMAINING 8 WEEKS, AND WILL COMPLETE A 30-MIN HOMEWORK ROUTINE ON NON-CLASS DAYS. EDUCATIONAL FILM GROUP PARTICIPANTS WILL ATTEND ONE 75-MIN CLASS PER WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS AND COMPLETE A DAILY RLS TREATMENT LOG; CLASSES WILL INCLUDE INFORMATION ON: RLS MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING SLEEP HYGIENE PRACTICES; OTHER SLEEP DISORDERS; AND COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES LIKELY TO BE OF INTEREST TO THOSE PARTICIPATING IN A YOGA AND SLEEP EDUCATION STUDY. YOGA AND TREATMENT LOGS WILL BE COLLECTED WEEKLY. FEASIBILITY OUTCOMES WILL INCLUDE RECRUITMENT, ENROLLMENT, AND RANDOMIZATION RATES, RETENTION, ADHERENCE, AND PROGRAM SATISFACTION. PROGRAM EVALUATION AND YOGA-DOSING QUESTIONNAIRES WILL BE COLLECTED AT WEEK 12; DATA ON EXPLORATORY OUTCOMES (E.G., RLS SYMPTOM SEVERITY (IRLS), SLEEP QUALITY (PSQI), MOOD (POMS, PSS), AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (SF-36)) WILL BE GATHERED AT BASELINE AND WEEK 12. DISCUSSION: THIS STUDY WILL LAY THE ESSENTIAL GROUNDWORK FOR A PLANNED LARGER RCT TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF A YOGA PROGRAM FOR REDUCING SYMPTOMS AND ASSOCIATED BURDEN OF RLS. IF THE FINDINGS OF THE CURRENT TRIAL AND THE SUBSEQUENT LARGER RCTS ARE POSITIVE, THIS STUDY WILL ALSO HELP SUPPORT A NEW APPROACH TO CLINICAL TREATMENT OF THIS CHALLENGING DISORDER, HELP FOSTER IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF RLS ETIOLOGY, AND ULTIMATELY CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCING THE INDIVIDUAL, SOCIETAL, AND ECONOMIC BURDEN ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CONDITION.

15  518  33 COMPARING ONCE- VERSUS TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN IN PREDOMINANTLY LOW INCOME MINORITIES: A RANDOMIZED DOSING TRIAL. BACKGROUND. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT ONCE-WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES ARE EFFECTIVE FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) IN WHITE ADULTS WITH HIGH SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. THE COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF TWICE-WEEKLY CLASSES AND GENERALIZABILITY TO RACIALLY DIVERSE LOW INCOME POPULATIONS ARE UNKNOWN. METHODS. WE CONDUCTED A 12-WEEK RANDOMIZED, PARALLEL-GROUP, DOSING TRIAL FOR 95 ADULTS RECRUITED FROM AN URBAN SAFETY-NET HOSPITAL AND FIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS COMPARING ONCE-WEEKLY (N = 49) VERSUS TWICE-WEEKLY (N = 46) STANDARDIZED YOGA CLASSES SUPPLEMENTED BY HOME PRACTICE. PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE CHANGE FROM BASELINE TO 12 WEEKS IN PAIN (11-POINT SCALE) AND BACK-RELATED FUNCTION (23-POINT MODIFIED ROLAND-MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE). RESULTS. 82% OF PARTICIPANTS WERE NONWHITE; 77% HAD ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD INCOMES <$40,000. THE SAMPLE'S BASELINE MEAN PAIN INTENSITY [6.9 (SD 1.6)] AND FUNCTION [13.7 (SD 5.0)] REFLECTED MODERATE TO SEVERE BACK PAIN AND IMPAIRMENT. PAIN AND BACK-RELATED FUNCTION IMPROVED WITHIN BOTH GROUPS (P < 0.001). HOWEVER, THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ONCE-WEEKLY AND TWICE-WEEKLY GROUPS FOR PAIN REDUCTION [-2.1 (95% CI -2.9, -1.3) VERSUS -2.4 (95% CI -3.1, -1.8), P = 0.62] OR BACK-RELATED FUNCTION [-5.1 (95% CI -7.0, -3.2) VERSUS -4.9 (95% CI -6.5, -3.3), P = 0.83]. CONCLUSIONS. TWELVE WEEKS OF ONCE-WEEKLY OR TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES WERE SIMILARLY EFFECTIVE FOR PREDOMINANTLY LOW INCOME MINORITY ADULTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN.

16 2558  50 YOGA FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN IN A PREDOMINANTLY MINORITY POPULATION: A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: SEVERAL STUDIES SUGGEST YOGA MAY BE EFFECTIVE FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN; HOWEVER, TRIALS TARGETING MINORITIES HAVE NOT BEEN CONDUCTED. PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVES: ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF STUDYING YOGA IN A PREDOMINANTLY MINORITY POPULATION WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. COLLECT PRELIMINARY DATA TO PLAN A LARGER POWERED STUDY. STUDY DESIGN: PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: TWO COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS IN A RACIALLY DIVERSE NEIGHBORHOOD OF BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS. PARTICIPANTS: THIRTY ENGLISH-SPEAKING ADULTS (MEAN AGE 44 YEARS, 83% FEMALE, 83% RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES; 48% WITH INCOMES < OR = $30,000) WITH MODERATE-TO-SEVERE CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. INTERVENTIONS: STANDARDIZED SERIES OF WEEKLY HATHA YOGA CLASSES FOR 12 WEEKS COMPARED TO A WAITLIST USUAL CARE CONTROL. OUTCOME MEASURES: FEASIBILITY MEASURED BY TIME TO COMPLETE ENROLLMENT, PROPORTION OF RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES ENROLLED, RETENTION RATES, AND ADVERSE EVENTS. PRIMARY EFFICACY OUTCOMES WERE CHANGES FROM BASELINE TO 12 WEEKS IN PAIN SCORE (0=NO PAIN TO 10=WORST POSSIBLE PAIN) AND BACK-RELATED FUNCTION USING THE MODIFIED ROLAND-MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE (0-23 POINT SCALE, HIGHER SCORES REFLECT POORER FUNCTION). SECONDARY EFFICACY OUTCOMES WERE ANALGESIC USE, GLOBAL IMPROVEMENT, AND QUALITY OF LIFE (SF-36). RESULTS: RECRUITMENT TOOK 2 MONTHS. RETENTION RATES WERE 97% AT 12 WEEKS AND 77% AT 26 WEEKS. MEAN PAIN SCORES FOR YOGA DECREASED FROM BASELINE TO 12 WEEKS (6.7 TO 4.4) COMPARED TO USUAL CARE, WHICH DECREASED FROM 7.5 TO 7.1 (P=.02). MEAN ROLAND SCORES FOR YOGA DECREASED FROM 14.5 TO 8.2 COMPARED TO USUAL CARE, WHICH DECREASED FROM 16.1 TO 12.5 (P=.28). AT 12 WEEKS, YOGA COMPARED TO USUAL CARE PARTICIPANTS REPORTED LESS ANALGESIC USE (13% VS 73%, P=.003), LESS OPIATE USE (0% VS 33%, P=.04), AND GREATER OVERALL IMPROVEMENT (73% VS 27%, P=.03). THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES IN SF-36 SCORES AND NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS. CONCLUSION: A YOGA STUDY INTERVENTION IN A PREDOMINANTLY MINORITY POPULATION WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN WAS MODERATELY FEASIBLE AND MAY BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN USUAL CARE FOR REDUCING PAIN AND PAIN MEDICATION USE.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
17  107  40 A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF THE EFFECTS OF CHAIR YOGA ON PAIN AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION AMONG COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS WITH LOWER EXTREMITY OSTEOARTHRITIS. OBJECTIVES: TO DETERMINE EFFECTS OF SIT 'N' FIT CHAIR YOGA, COMPARED TO A HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAM (HEP), ON PAIN AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION IN OLDER ADULTS WITH LOWER EXTREMITY OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) WHO COULD NOT PARTICIPATE IN STANDING EXERCISE. DESIGN: TWO-ARM RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: ONE HUD SENIOR HOUSING FACILITY AND ONE DAY SENIOR CENTER IN SOUTH FLORIDA. PARTICIPANTS: COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS (N = 131) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO CHAIR YOGA (N = 66) OR HEP (N = 65). THIRTEEN DROPPED AFTER ASSIGNMENT BUT PRIOR TO THE INTERVENTION; SIX DROPPED DURING THE INTERVENTION; 106 OF 112 COMPLETED AT LEAST 12 OF 16 SESSIONS (95% RETENTION RATE). INTERVENTIONS: PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED EITHER CHAIR YOGA OR HEP. BOTH INTERVENTIONS CONSISTED OF TWICE-WEEKLY 45-MINUTE SESSIONS FOR 8 WEEKS. MEASUREMENTS: PRIMARY: PAIN, PAIN INTERFERENCE; SECONDARY: BALANCE, GAIT SPEED, FATIGUE, FUNCTIONAL ABILITY MEASURED AT BASELINE, AFTER 4 WEEKS OF INTERVENTION, AT THE END OF THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION, AND POST-INTERVENTION (1 AND 3 MONTHS). RESULTS: THE CHAIR YOGA GROUP SHOWED GREATER REDUCTION IN PAIN INTERFERENCE DURING THE INTERVENTION (P = .01), SUSTAINED THROUGH 3 MONTHS (P = .022). WOMAC PAIN (P = .048), GAIT SPEED (P = .024), AND FATIGUE (P = .037) WERE IMPROVED IN THE YOGA GROUP DURING THE INTERVENTION (P = .048) BUT IMPROVEMENTS WERE NOT SUSTAINED POST INTERVENTION. CHAIR YOGA HAD NO EFFECT ON BALANCE. CONCLUSION: AN 8-WEEK CHAIR YOGA PROGRAM WAS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCTION IN PAIN, PAIN INTERFERENCE, AND FATIGUE, AND IMPROVEMENT IN GAIT SPEED, BUT ONLY THE EFFECTS ON PAIN INTERFERENCE WERE SUSTAINED 3 MONTHS POST INTERVENTION. CHAIR YOGA SHOULD BE FURTHER EXPLORED AS A NONPHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTION FOR OLDER PEOPLE WITH OA IN THE LOWER EXTREMITIES.

18   74  42 A GROUP-BASED YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION FOR URINARY INCONTINENCE IN WOMEN: A PILOT RANDOMIZED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY, EFFICACY, AND SAFETY OF A GROUP-BASED YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION FOR MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER WOMEN WITH URINARY INCONTINENCE. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A PILOT RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF AMBULATORY WOMEN AGED 40 YEARS AND OLDER WITH STRESS, URGENCY, OR MIXED-TYPE INCONTINENCE. WOMEN WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 6-WEEK YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM (N = 10) CONSISTING OF TWICE WEEKLY GROUP CLASSES AND ONCE WEEKLY HOME PRACTICE OR A WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 9). ALL PARTICIPANTS ALSO RECEIVED WRITTEN PAMPHLETS ABOUT STANDARD BEHAVIORAL SELF-MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES FOR INCONTINENCE. CHANGES IN INCONTINENCE WERE ASSESSED WITH 7-DAY VOIDING DIARIES. RESULTS: THE MEAN (SD) AGE WAS 61.4 (8.2) YEARS, AND THE MEAN BASELINE FREQUENCY OF INCONTINENCE WAS 2.5 (1.3) EPISODES/D. AFTER 6 WEEKS, THE TOTAL INCONTINENCE FREQUENCY DECREASED BY 70% (1.8 [0.9] FEWER EPISODES/D) IN THE YOGA THERAPY VERSUS 13% (0.3 [1.7] FEWER EPISODES/D) IN THE CONTROL GROUP (P = 0.049). PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA THERAPY GROUP ALSO REPORTED AN AVERAGE OF 71% DECREASE IN STRESS INCONTINENCE FREQUENCY (0.7 [0.8] FEWER EPISODES/D) COMPARED WITH A 25% INCREASE IN CONTROLS (0.2 [1.1] MORE EPISODES/D) (P = 0.039). NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN REDUCTION IN URGENCY INCONTINENCE WERE DETECTED BETWEEN THE YOGA THERAPY VERSUS CONTROL GROUPS (1.0 [1.0] VERSUS 0.5 [0.5] FEWER EPISODES/D; P = 0.20). ALL WOMEN STARTING THE YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM COMPLETED AT LEAST 90% OF THE GROUP CLASSES AND PRACTICE SESSIONS. TWO PARTICIPANTS IN EACH GROUP REPORTED ADVERSE EVENTS UNRELATED TO THE INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS PROVIDE PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE FEASIBILITY, EFFICACY, AND SAFETY OF A GROUP-BASED YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE URINARY INCONTINENCE IN WOMEN.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
19   34  33 A 12-WEEK IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM IMPROVED BALANCE AND MOBILITY IN OLDER COMMUNITY-DWELLING PEOPLE: A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: EXERCISE THAT CHALLENGES BALANCE CAN IMPROVE MOBILITY AND PREVENT FALLS IN OLDER ADULTS. YOGA AS A PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OPTION FOR OLDER ADULTS IS NOT WELL STUDIED.

METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A BLINDED, PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS. PARTICIPANTS WERE 54 COMMUNITY DWELLERS (MEAN AGE 68 YEARS, SD 7.1) NOT CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING IN YOGA OR TAI CHI. THE INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 27) PARTICIPATED IN A 12-WEEK, TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA PROGRAM FOCUSED ON STANDING POSTURES AND RECEIVED A FALL PREVENTION EDUCATION BOOKLET. THE CONTROL GROUP (N = 27) RECEIVED THE EDUCATION BOOKLET ONLY. PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS STANDING BALANCE COMPONENT OF THE SHORT PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE BATTERY WITH ADDITION OF ONE-LEGGED STANCE TIME (STANDING BALANCE). SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE THE TIMED SIT-TO-STAND TEST, TIMED 4-M WALK, ONE-LEGGED STAND WITH EYES CLOSED, AND SHORT FALLS EFFICACY SCALE-INTERNATIONAL. FEASIBILITY WAS MEASURED BY RECORDING CLASS ATTENDANCE AND ADVERSE EVENTS. RESULTS: FIFTY-TWO PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENTS. THE INTERVENTION GROUP SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED COMPARED WITH CONTROL GROUP ON STANDING BALANCE (MEAN DIFFERENCE = 1.52 SECONDS, 95% CI 0.10-2.96, P = .04), SIT-TO-STAND TEST (MEAN DIFFERENCE = -3.43 SECONDS, 95% CI -5.23 TO -1.64, P < .001), 4-M WALK (MEAN DIFFERENCE = -0.50 SECONDS, 95% CI -0.72 TO -0.28, P < .001), AND ONE-LEGGED STAND WITH EYES CLOSED (MEAN DIFFERENCE = 1.93 SECONDS, 95% CI 0.40-3.46, P = .02). AVERAGE CLASS ATTENDANCE WAS 20 OF 24 CLASSES (83%). NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS OCCURRED. CONCLUSIONS: THIS TRIAL DEMONSTRATES THE BALANCE AND MOBILITY-RELATED BENEFITS AND FEASIBILITY OF IYENGAR YOGA FOR OLDER PEOPLE. THE FALL PREVENTION EFFECT OF IYENGAR YOGA WARRANTS FURTHER INVESTIGATION.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
20 1748  42 PILOT RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL OF A DYADIC YOGA PROGRAM FOR GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS. BACKGROUND: WHILE THE USE OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE IN MANAGING GLIOMA PATIENTS' SYMPTOMS IS NOT WELL STUDIED, THE HIGH SYMPTOM BURDEN IN PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS IS WELL ESTABLISHED. WE CONDUCTED A PILOT RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF A DYADIC YOGA (DY) INTERVENTION AS A SUPPORTIVE CARE STRATEGY. METHODS: GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 12-SESSION DY OR WAITLIST CONTROL (WLC) GROUP. PRIOR TO RADIOTHERAPY AND RANDOMIZATION, BOTH GROUPS COMPLETED MEASURES OF CANCER-RELATED SYMPTOMS (MD ANDERSON SYMPTOM INVENTORY-BRAIN TUMOR MODULE), DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (CENTER FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES-DEPRESSION MEASURE), FATIGUE (BRIEF FATIGUE INVENTORY), AND OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL; MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY 36-ITEM SHORT-FORM SURVEY). DYADS WERE REASSESSED AT THE LAST DAY OF RADIOTHERAPY. RESULTS: TWENTY PATIENTS (MEAN AGE: 46 YEARS, 50% FEMALE, 80% WHO GRADE IV AND CAREGIVERS (MEAN AGE: 50 YEARS, 70% FEMALE, 50% SPOUSES) PARTICIPATED IN THE TRIAL. A PRIORI FEASIBILITY CRITERIA WERE MET REGARDING CONSENT (70%), ADHERENCE (88%), AND RETENTION (95%) RATES. CONTROLLING FOR RELEVANT COVARIATES, CHANGE SCORE ANALYSES REVEALED CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS FOR PATIENTS IN THE DY COMPARED WITH THE WLC GROUP FOR OVERALL CANCER SYMPTOM SEVERITY (D = 0.96) AND SYMPTOM INTERFERENCE (D = 0.74), DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (D = 0.71), AND MENTAL QOL (D = 0.69). CAREGIVERS IN THE DY GROUP REPORTED CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (D = 1.12), FATIGUE (D = 0.89), AND MENTAL QOL (D = 0.49) RELATIVE TO THOSE IN THE WLC GROUP. CONCLUSION: A DY INTERVENTION APPEARS TO BE A FEASIBLE AND BENEFICIAL SYMPTOM AND QOL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. AN EFFICACY TRIAL WITH A MORE STRINGENT CONTROL GROUP IS WARRANTED.

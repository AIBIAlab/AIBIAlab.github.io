1 1536 119 KETAMINE, TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION, AND DEPRESSION SPECIFIC YOGA AND MINDFULNESS BASED COGNITIVE THERAPY IN MANAGEMENT OF TREATMENT RESISTANT DEPRESSION: REVIEW AND SOME DATA ON EFFICACY. DEPRESSION AFFECTS ABOUT 121 MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE AND PREVALENCE OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD) IN US ADULTS IS 6.4%. TREATMENT RESISTANT DEPRESSION (TRD) ACCOUNTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 12-20% OF ALL DEPRESSION PATIENTS AND COSTS $29-$48 BILLION ANNUALLY. KETAMINE AND REPETITIVE TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION (RTMS) HAVE USEFUL ROLES IN TRD, BUT THEIR UTILITY IN LONG TERM IS UNKNOWN. AS PER THE LATEST LITERATURE, THE INTERVENTIONS USING YOGA AND MEDITATION INCLUDING THE MINDFULNESS BASED COGNITIVE THERAPY (MBCT) HAVE BEEN USEFUL IN TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION AND RELAPSE PREVENTION. WE PRESENT A REVIEW OF RTMS, KETAMINE, AND MBCT AND ALSO REPORT EFFICACY OF A DEPRESSION SPECIFIC, INNOVATIVE, AND TRANSLATIONAL MODEL OF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS BASED COGNITIVE THERAPY (DEPS Y-MBCT), DEVELOPED BY THE FIRST AUTHOR. DEPS Y-MBCT AS AN ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT SUCCESSFULLY AMELIORATED TRD SYMPTOMS IN 27/32 PATIENTS IN AN OPEN LABEL PILOT TRIAL IN TRD PATIENTS. CONSIDERING THE LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING TREATMENT OPTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE OF KETAMINE AND RTMS WHEN USED AS THE SOLE MODALITY OF TREATMENT, WE SUGGEST A "TIERED APPROACH FOR TRD" BY COMBINING KETAMINE AND RTMS (ALONE OR ALONG WITH ANTIDEPRESSANTS) FOR RAPID REMISSION OF ACUTE DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AND TO USE DEPS Y-MBCT FOR MAINTAINING REMISSION AND PREVENTING RELAPSE.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
2  533  19 COMPARISON OF TWO TAGTEACH ERROR-CORRECTION PROCEDURES TO TEACH BEGINNER YOGA POSES TO ADULTS. TEACHING WITH ACOUSTICAL GUIDANCE INVOLVES AUDITORY FEEDBACK (E.G., A CLICK SOUND WHEN A DESIRED BEHAVIOR OCCURS) AS PART OF A MULTICOMPONENT INTERVENTION KNOWN AS TAGTEACH. TAGTEACH HAS BEEN FOUND TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE IN SPORT, DANCE, SURGICAL TECHNIQUE, AND WALKING. WE COMPARED THE EFFICACY AND EFFICIENCY OF THE STANDARD TAGTEACH ERROR-CORRECTION PROCEDURE AND A MODIFIED TAGTEACH ERROR-CORRECTION PROCEDURE TO TEACH 4 NOVICE ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS BEGINNER YOGA POSES. BOTH ERROR-CORRECTION PROCEDURES WERE EFFECTIVE FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS; HOWEVER, THE RELATIVE EFFICIENCY OF THESE ERROR-CORRECTION PROCEDURES WAS UNCLEAR. RESULTS ARE DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF LIMITATIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
3 2500  27 YOGA AS THE "NEXT WAVE" OF THERAPEUTIC MODALITIES FOR TREATMENT OF INSOMNIA. INSOMNIA RATES CONTINUE TO RISE, ESPECIALLY AMONG SPECIFIC POPULATIONS. CURRENT NONPHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENTS RELY PRIMARILY UPON COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR INSOMNIA (CBT-I), WHICH WAS INTRODUCED IN THE 1970S. NEWER TREATMENTS HAVE INCORPORATED CBT "THIRD WAVE" TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING MINDFULNESS AND ACCEPTANCE TECHNIQUES. YOGA PRACTICE IS WELL SUITED TO COMPLEMENT EXISTING THERAPIES AND TO ADDRESS SLEEP PROBLEMS IN A MORE HOLISTIC WAY. CURRENT THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL APPROACHES TO TREATING INSOMNIA ARE DISCUSSED, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON THE ROLE OF YOGA IN ADDRESSING PRECIPITATING AND PERPETUATING FACTORS IN INSOMNIA THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN LARGELY OVERLOOKED.AN ESTIMATED ONE-THIRD OF U.S. ADULTS SUFFER FROM INSOMNIA (CHEN, GELAYE, & WILLIAMS, 2013; MELLINGER, BALTER, & UHLENHUTH, 1985; OHAYON, 2002), AND THE PROBLEM APPEARS TO BE GROWING. WHILE TREATMENT FOR INSOMNIA HAS HELPED TO ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM FOR SOME (IRWIN, COLE, & NICASSIO, 2006; MORIN ET AL., 2009), PREVALENCE OF INSOMNIA IS ON THE RISE, ESPECIALLY AMONG CERTAIN GROUPS, INCLUDING ELDERLY AND MILITARY POPULATIONS (MORIN, 2009; MYSLIWIEC ET AL., 2013). RISING RATES OF INSOMNIA HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO CHANGES IN LIFESTYLE AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, INCLUDING INCREASED RELIANCE ON TECHNOLOGY AND DECREASED SYNCHRONY WITH NATURAL WAKE-SLEEP RHYTHMS (BRAHINSKY, 2013; WALLACE-GUY ET AL., 2002; YUN, BAZAR, GERBER, LEE, & DANIEL, 2005).	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
4 1432  23 IMPROVING PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH IN FRONTLINE MENTAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS: YOGA-BASED STRESS MANAGEMENT VERSUS COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL STRESS MANAGEMENT. THE NEED FOR BRIEF, LOW-COST, EASILY DISSEMINABLE AND EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS TO PROMOTE HEALTHY LIFESTYLES IS HIGH. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. WE DEVELOPED TWO STUDIES TO COMPARE THE IMPACTS OF COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL STRESS MANAGEMENT (CBSM) AND YOGA BASED STRESS MANAGEMENT (YBSM) INTERVENTIONS FOR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS. STUDY 1 OFFERED AN 8-WEEK YBSM INTERVENTION TO 37 MENTAL HEALTHCARE PARTICIPANTS AND COLLECTED HEALTH DATA PRE AND POST. STUDY 2 OFFERED YBSM AND CBSM CLASSES TO 40 RANDOMLY ASSIGNED MENTAL HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND COLLECTED MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH DATA AT FOUR TIME POINTS. IN STUDY 1, USING T-TESTS, THE YBSM INTERVENTION AFFECTED A NUMBER OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL WELLBEING INDICES PRE TO POST. IN STUDY 2, USING LINEAR MIXED MODELING, BOTH YBSM AND CBSM GROUPS IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY (P <.05) IN FRUIT AND VEGETABLE INTAKE, HEART RATE, ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION, RELAXATION AND AWARENESS, PROFESSIONAL QUALITY OF LIFE, COMPASSION SATISFACTION, BURNOUT, DEPRESSION, AND STRESS LEVELS. THERE WAS A GROUP BY TIME EFFECT FOR COPING CONFIDENCE (CBSM INCREASED MORE, P<.05, F = 4.34), PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (YBSM INCREASED MORE, P<.05, F = 3.47), OVERALL MENTAL HEALTH (YBSM INCREASED MORE, P<.10, F =5.32), AND SECONDARY TRAUMATIC STRESS (YBSM DECREASED MORE, P<.10, F = 4.89). YBSM AND CBSM APPEAR TO BE USEFUL FOR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS' MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH. YBSM DEMONSTRATES SOME BENEFIT ABOVE AND BEYOND THE EXTREMELY WELL-STUDIED AND EMPIRICALLY SUPPORTED CBSM, INCLUDING INCREASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, OVERALL MENTAL HEALTH, AND DECREASED SECONDARY TRAUMATIC STRESS BENEFITS.	2017

7 1570  30 MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE CALCULUS CHOLECYSTITIS WITH INTEGRATED AYURVEDA AND YOGA INTERVENTION: A CASE REPORT. ACUTE CALCULUS CHOLECYSTITIS (ACC) IS A FREQUENTLY REPORTED MEDICAL CONDITION IN GENERAL PRACTICE. APPROXIMATELY 20% OF PATIENTS WITH GALLBLADDER STONES EXPERIENCE ACC IN THEIR LIFETIME. AYURVEDA AND YOGA ARE ANCIENT TRADITIONAL SYSTEMS OF MEDICINE USED FOR TREATMENT OF DISEASES AND IMPROVING AND MAINTAINING HEALTH. THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASED USE OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SEVERAL HEALTH CONDITIONS IN INDIA AND WORLDWIDE. THE PRESENT CASE STUDY IS OF 34 YEARS FEMALE PATIENT WHO HAD ACC. POST DIAGNOSIS OF ACC PATIENT WAS ADVISED TO UNDERGO CHOLECYSTECTOMY; HOWEVER, SHE APPROACHED ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES WITH C/O VOMITING, NAUSEA, ABDOMINAL PAIN, JAUNDICE, ITCHING, AND ABDOMINAL BLOATING WITH DERANGED LIVER FUNCTIONS. AYURVEDA AND YOGA INTERVENTION PROTOCOL WAS DESIGNED. AYURVEDA TREATMENT CONSISTED OF MILD PURGATION (MRUDUVIRECHANA) WITH TRIVRITTALEHYAM FOR CONSECUTIVE SEVEN DAYS, FOLLOWED BY ORAL ADMINISTRATION OF TAB LIV 52, BHUNIMBADI KADHA TWICE DAILY, AND AMALAKI RASAYANA IN THE MORNING FOR 45 DAYS. PATIENTS RECEIVED 8 TELEYOGA SESSIONS OVER A PERIOD OF 45 DAYS. A THERAPEUTIC DIET WAS ADVISED DURING TREATMENT PERIOD. AFTER TWO MONTHS PATIENT REPORTED COMPLETE RECOVERY IN SYMPTOMS, AND ALL LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS REACHED TO NORMAL RANGE. THIS CASE STUDY SUGGESTS THE POSITIVE ROLE OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA INTERVENTION IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ACC. THIS CASE REPORT WARRANTS FUTURE CLINICAL STUDIES ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE IN ACC.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
8 2498  17 YOGA AS SANCTUARY: A VALUABLE MIND-BODY INTERVENTION FOR THE LESBIAN COMMUNITY. POETIC AUTOETHNOGRAPHY PROVIDES A RESEARCH METHODOLOGY TO EXPLORE YOGA AS A MIND-BODY INTERVENTION THAT CREATES SANCTUARY. USING THIS QUALITATIVE METHOD AND RETRIEVING DATA FROM MY PERSONAL JOURNALS, DAILY WORKOUT JOURNALS, EXPERIENCES AS A LESBIAN-IDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT IN YOGA CLASSES, AND YOGA INSTRUCTOR, I TURN THE RESEARCH LENS ON MYSELF IN ORDER TO EXAMINE MY SOCIOLOGICAL LIFE STORY. AT A CRITICAL TIME IN MY LIFE WHEN I WAS STRUGGLING WITH THE FRAGMENTATION, ANXIETY, AND DESPAIR RESULTING FROM DEALING WITH HOMOPHOBIA IN A HETERONORMATIVE WORLD, YOGA PROVIDED SANCTUARY FOR ME. MY YOGA PRACTICE INCREASED MY SELF-EFFICACY, PROVIDING TRANSFERABLE TECHNIQUES FOR FINDING REFUGE WITHIN MYSELF, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE ADVERSITY I WAS FACING IN MY LIFE. PLACES OF SANCTUARY ARE CRITICAL FOR MEMBERS OF MINORITY GROUPS WHO OFTEN FACE MARGINALIZATION AND OPPRESSION, WHICH COMPROMISE THEIR WELL-BEING.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
9   32  37 5-HTTLPR AND MTHFR 677C>T POLYMORPHISMS AND RESPONSE TO YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION IN MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER: A RANDOMIZED ACTIVE-CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE SUGGESTING THAT BOTH GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS MODULATE TREATMENT OUTCOME IN, A HIGHLY HETEROGENEOUS, MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD). 5-HTTLPR VARIANT OF THE SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER GENE (SLC6A4) AND MTHFR 677C>T POLYMORPHISMS HAVE BEEN LINKED TO THE PATHOGENESIS OF MDD, AND ANTIDEPRESSANT TREATMENT RESPONSE. THE EVIDENCE IS LACKING ON THE CLINICAL UTILITY OF YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH MDD WHO HAVE 5-HTTLPR AND MTHFR 677C>T POLYMORPHISMS AND LESS LIKELY TO RESPOND TO MEDICATIONS (SSRIS). AIMS: WE AIMED TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF YBLI IN THOSE WHO HAVE SUSCEPTIBLE 5-HTTLPR AND MTHFR 677C>T POLYMORPHISMS AND ARE LESS LIKELY TO DRUG THERAPY WITH SSRIS. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: IN A 12 WEEK RANDOMIZED ACTIVE-CONTROLLED TRIAL, MDD PATIENTS (N = 178) WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE YBLI OR DRUG THERAPY. METHODS: GENOTYPING WAS CONDUCTED USING PCR-BASED METHODS. THE CLINICAL REMISSION WAS DEFINED AS BDI-II SCORE </= 9. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: AN INTENT-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED, AND THE ASSOCIATION OF GENOTYPE WITH TREATMENT REMISSION CONSISTED OF THE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL. A P VALUE OF <0.05 WAS CONSIDERED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. RESULTS: MULTIVARIATE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELS FOR REMISSION INCLUDING EITHER 5-HTTLPR OR MTHFR 677C>T GENOTYPES SHOWED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT ODDS OF REMISSION IN YOGA ARM VS. DRUG ARM. NEITHER 5-HTTLPR NOR MTHFR 677C>T GENOTYPE SHOWED ANY INFLUENCE ON REMISSION TO YBLI (P = 0.73 AND P = 0.64, RESPECTIVELY). FURTHER ANALYSIS SHOWED CHILDHOOD ADVERSITY INTERACT WITH 5-HTTLPR AND MTHFR 677C>T POLYMORPHISMS TO DECREASE TREATMENT RESPONSE IN DRUG TREATMENT ARM, BUT NOT IN YOGA ARM. CONCLUSIONS: YBLI PROVIDES MDD REMISSION IN THOSE WHO HAVE SUSCEPTIBLE 5-HTTLPR AND MTHFR 677C>T POLYMORPHISMS AND ARE RESISTANT TO SSRIS TREATMENT. YBLI MAY BE THERAPEUTIC FOR MDD INDEPENDENT OF HETEROGENEITY IN ITS ETIOPATHOGENESIS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
10 2327  23 TRENDS IN YOGA, TAI CHI, AND QIGONG USE AMONG US ADULTS, 2002-2017. OBJECTIVES: TO EXAMINE THE CHARACTERISTICS AND TEMPORAL TRENDS OF YOGA, TAI CHI, AND QIGONG (YTQ) USE AMONG US ADULTS. METHODS: USING THE 2002, 2007, 2012, AND 2017 NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEYS, WE EXAMINED THE PREVALENCE, PATTERNS, AND PREDICTING FACTORS OF YTQ USE BY TAYLOR SERIES LINEAR REGRESSION, THE WALD F CHI(2) TEST, AND MULTIVARIABLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELS (N = 116 404). RESULTS: YTQ USE INCREASED FROM 5.8% IN 2002 TO 14.5% IN 2017 (P </= .001). ONLY 6.6% OF YTQ USERS WERE REFERRED BY THEIR MEDICAL DOCTORS, AND APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD DISCLOSED THEIR USE OF YTQ TO MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. REASONS FOR USING YTQ INCLUDED (1) YTQ WAS BENEFICIAL, (2) YTQ FOCUSED ON THE WHOLE PERSON, AND (3) YTQ WAS NATURAL. ACUTE AND CHRONIC PAIN, ARTHRITIS, AND DEPRESSION WERE THE TOP 3 MEDICAL CONDITIONS FOR WHICH PEOPLE USED YTQ THE MOST. CONCLUSIONS: YTQ USE IS INCREASING SUBSTANTIALLY, MAINLY BECAUSE OF ITS NATURAL AND HOLISTIC HEALING APPROACH TOWARD HEALTH AND CHRONIC DISEASES. FUTURE STUDIES AIMING TO EXPLORE HOW TO BEST INTEGRATE YTQ INTO THE CURRENT HEALTH CARE SYSTEM ARE WARRANTED.	2019

IT IS VERY UNCOMMON AND USUALLY AFFECTS YOUNG OTHERWISE HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS. THE MOST COMMON SYMTOMS ARE CHEST PAIN AND DYSPNEA WITH SUBCUTANEOUS EMPHYSEMA FOUND ON EXAMINATION. TREATMENT IS USUALLY CONSERVATIVE WITH PAIN RELIEF. HERE, WE PRESENT AN UNUSUAL CASE OF A 23-YEAR-OLD PREVIOUSLY HEALTHY MALE WHO WAS DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMOMEDIASTINUM AFTER PRACTISING YOGA. THIS CASE DEMONSTRATES THE NEED TO STUDY PATIENTS WITH CHEST PAIN OF UNKNOWN CAUSE IN DETAILS TO FIND CAUSES.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
12 2912  25 [RECENT MEDICAL RESEARCH ON YOGA AND STATES OF CONCENTRATION]. TRADITIONAL ORIENTAL THINKING ATTRACTS THE GROWING SCIENTIFIC INTEREST OF OCCIDENTAL PRACTITIONERS. DR. PIERRE ETEVENON, HEAD OF THE DEPARTMENT OF NEURO-PSYCHO-PHARMACOLOGY AT THE FRENCH INSTITUTE FOR HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESEARCH (INSERM), HELD SEVERAL CONVERSATIONS AND SCIENTIFIC EXCHANGES WITH THE AUTHOR, AND KINDLY PROVIDED COPIES OF SOME OF HIS WORKS. THEY ARE AT THE BASIS OF THE PRESENT PAPER. M. A. DESCAMPS (PARIS) FOUND THAT ASANAS--YOGA POSTURES-- ARE GENERATORS OF DYNAMIC ACTION WHEN THERE IS AN EXTENSION OF THE SPINAL COLUMN, WHILST THEY LEAD TO QUIET STATES WHEN THERE IS A FLEXION OF IT. CLAEYS AND GONES (BELGIUM) PROVED THAT OVERALL GLOBAL RELAXATION, AS WELL AS DIFFERENTIAL RELAXATION WERE FAR MORE EFFECTIVE AND DEEP WHEN OBTAINED BY YOGIS THAN THOSE ATTEMPTED BY UNIVERSITY STUDENTS MAJORING IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION. LONSDORFER AND NUSSBAUM (FRANCE) STUDIED SEVERAL PARAMETERS CONCERNING HATHA-YOGA AND CONCLUDED THAT IT PROVIDES A REGULAR FUNCTIONING OF THE MAIN BODILY FUNCTIONS FOSTERING THUS A PSYCHO-PHYSICAL BALANCE. WALLACE AND BENSON (U.S.A.) PROVED THAT TRANSCENDENTAL MEDITATION INCREASES AEROBIC METABOLISM, COUNTERACTING ANAEROBIC METABOLISM WHICH IS RELATED TO MENTAL DISTRESS. ETEVENON (PARIS) INVESTIGATED NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF YOGA IN CONNECTION TO ANCIENT INDIAN CONCEPTS (UPANISHADS) ON SLEEPING, MEDITATION AND DEGREE OF CONSCIOUSNESS. DR. ETEVENON HAS STUDIED THE PHYLOGENETIC EVOLUTION OF WAKING-SLEEPING CYCLES, FOCUSING ON PHYLOGENETIC AND ONTONGENETIC APPEARANCES OF REM CYCLES (ACTIVATED SLEEP). A CORRELATION HAS BEEN MADE WITH EEG STUDIES DURING STATES OF CONCENTRATION (YOGA, TRANSCENDENTAL MEDITATION, ZEN). THESE STATES HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE SPECIFIC BRAIN ACTIVITIES, AND DIFFERENT FROM DEEP SLEEP, IN SPITE OF CERTAIN SIMILARITIES IN THE EEG. SEVERAL HYPOTHESIS ARE SET FORTH TO EXPLAIN BRAIN ACTIVITIES UNDERLYING SITES OF CONCENTRATION. THE POSSIBILITIES OF DEVELOPING A CONSCIOUS MASTERING OF DREAMS ARE ALSO UNDER RESEARCH, AND SPECIAL ATTENTION IS PAID TO THE WORKS OF SAINT DENYS (1867), AND HINDU TRADITION. THIS PAPER DISCUSSES ALSO THE PSYCHOLOGICAL, THERAPEUTIC AND ANTHROPOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS OF RECENT DISCOVERIES IN THE FIELD.	1975	
                                                                                                                                                                            
13 1501  18 INVERTED YOGA AND NEAR SYNCOPE: AN UNUSUAL DIAGNOSIS OF RIGHT VENTRICULAR MYXOMA. PRIMARY CARDIAC TUMORS ARE EXTREMELY RARE AND ARE DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE. ALTHOUGH USUALLY BENIGN IN NATURE, MYXOMAS REQUIRE SURGICAL RESECTION DUE TO THEIR INCREASED RISK OF EMBOLIC AND CARDIAC COMPLICATIONS, WITH THE TIMING OF RESECTION DEPENDENT ON THE PRESENTATION AND SIZE OF THE TUMOR. HOWEVER, IF DIAGNOSED EARLY, PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY BENIGN CARDIAC TUMORS HAVE EXCELLENT PROGNOSIS FOLLOWING SURGERY. THEREFORE, A HIGH INDEX OF SUSPICION AND A WIDE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN DETECTING RARE CONDITIONS THAT CAN AFFECT OTHERWISE HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS. WE PRESENT AN UNCOMMON CASE OF A RIGHT VENTRICULAR MYXOMA THAT WAS DISCOVERED WHEN THE PATIENT WAS PERFORMING INVERTED YOGA AND EXPERIENCED A NEAR SYNCOPAL EPISODE. PATIENT SUBSEQUENTLY UNDERWENT AN ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION AND WAS FOUND TO HAVE A RIGHT VENTRICULAR MYXOMA THAT WAS EXCISED. ALTHOUGH RECURRENCE IS RARE, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR PHYSICIANS TO REMAIN VIGILANT AND CONTINUE CAREFUL AND CONSISTENT FOLLOW-UP FOR PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF A CARDIAC MYXOMA.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
14 2396  15 YOGA AND CHEMOREFLEX RESPONSE TO HYPOXIA AND HYPERCAPNIA. WE TESTED WHETHER CHEMOREFLEX SENSITIVITY COULD BE AFFECTED BY THE PRACTICE OF YOGA, AND WHETHER THIS IS SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF A SLOW BREATHING RATE OBTAINED DURING YOGA OR AS A GENERAL CONSEQUENCE OF YOGA. WE FOUND THAT SLOW BREATHING RATE PER SE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED CHEMOREFLEX SENSITIVITY, BUT LONG-TERM YOGA PRACTICE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR A GENERALISED REDUCTION IN CHEMOREFLEX.	2000	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
15 2164  19 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND SELF-ESTEEM ON MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS-A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS FOUND THAT YOGA CAN ENHANCE QUALITY OF LIFE AND EASE MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. THE STUDY EXAMINED WHETHER SELF-ESTEEM MEDIATED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE, FATIGUE AND MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS, UTILIZING VALIDATED OUTCOME MEASURES. STUDY DESIGN: THIS IS A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA WITH THOSE OF USUAL CARE IN 40 BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WHO SUFFERED FROM MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS. ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED ALL 3 ASSESSMENTS (WEEK 0, WEEK 12, AND WEEK 24) AND PROVIDED FULL DATA. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: OUTCOMES WERE MEASURED USING SELF-RATING INSTRUMENTS. MEDIATION ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED USING SPSS. RESULTS: SELF-ESTEEM MEDIATED THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON TOTAL MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS (B=-2.11, 95% BCI [-5.40 TO -0.37]), PSYCHOLOGICAL MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS (B=-0.94, 95% BCI [-2.30 TO -0.01]), AND UROGENITAL MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS (B=-0.66, 95% BCI [-1.65 TO -0.15]), QUALITY OF LIFE (B=8.04, 95% BCI [3.15-17.03]), SOCIAL WELL-BEING (B=1.80, 95% BCI [0.54-4.21]), EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING (B=1.62, 95% BCI [0.70-3.34]), FUNCTIONAL WELL-BEING (B=1.84, 95% BCI [0.59-4.13]), AND FATIGUE (B=4.34, 95% BCI [1.28-9.55]). SELF-ESTEEM HAD NO EFFECT ON SOMATOVEGETATIVE MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS (B=-0.50, 95% BCI N.S.) OR ON PHYSICAL WELL-BEING (B=0.79, 95% BCI N.S.). CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS SUPPORT THE ASSUMPTION THAT SELF-ESTEEM PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF YOGA AND THAT YOGA CAN HAVE LONG-TERM BENEFITS FOR WOMEN DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER AND UNDERGOING MENOPAUSAL TRANSITION.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
16  655  17 EEG PAROXYSMAL GAMMA WAVES DURING BHRAMARI PRANAYAMA: A YOGA BREATHING TECHNIQUE. HERE WE REPORT THAT A SPECIFIC FORM OF YOGA CAN GENERATE CONTROLLED HIGH-FREQUENCY GAMMA WAVES. FOR THE FIRST TIME, PAROXYSMAL GAMMA WAVES (PGW) WERE OBSERVED IN EIGHT SUBJECTS PRACTICING A YOGA TECHNIQUE OF BREATHING CONTROL CALLED BHRAMARI PRANAYAMA (BHPR). TO OBTAIN NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE NATURE OF THE EEG DURING BHPR, WE ANALYZED EEG SIGNALS USING TIME-FREQUENCY REPRESENTATIONS (TFR), INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS (ICA), AND EEG TOMOGRAPHY (LORETA). WE FOUND THAT THE PGW CONSISTS OF HIGH-FREQUENCY BIPHASIC RIPPLES. THIS UNUSUAL ACTIVITY IS DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO PREVIOUS REPORTS ON YOGA AND MEDITATION. IT IS CONCLUDED THIS EEG ACTIVITY IS MOST PROBABLY NON-EPILEPTIC, AND THAT APPLYING THE SAME METHODOLOGY TO OTHER MEDITATION RECORDINGS MIGHT YIELD AN IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF THE NEUROCORRELATES OF MEDITATION.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
17 1468  23 INNER ENGINEERING PRACTICES AND ADVANCED 4-DAY ISHA YOGA RETREAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CANNABIMIMETIC EFFECTS WITH INCREASED ENDOCANNABINOIDS AND SHORT-TERM AND SUSTAINED IMPROVEMENT IN MENTAL HEALTH: A PROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL STUDY OF MEDITATORS. BACKGROUND: ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION ARE COMMON IN THE MODERN WORLD, AND THERE IS GROWING DEMAND FOR ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES SUCH AS MEDITATION. MEDITATION CAN DECREASE PERCEIVED STRESS AND INCREASE GENERAL WELL-BEING, ALTHOUGH THE PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISM IS NOT WELL-CHARACTERIZED. ENDOCANNABINOIDS (ECBS), LIPID MEDIATORS ASSOCIATED WITH ENHANCED MOOD AND REDUCED ANXIETY/DEPRESSION, HAVE NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY STUDIED AS BIOMARKERS OF MEDITATION EFFECTS. OUR AIM WAS TO ASSESS BIOMARKERS (ECBS AND BRAIN-DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR [BDNF]) AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS AFTER A MEDITATION RETREAT. METHODS: THIS WAS AN OBSERVATIONAL PILOT STUDY OF ADULTS BEFORE AND AFTER THE 4-DAY ISHA YOGA BHAVA SPANDANA PROGRAM RETREAT. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED ONLINE SURVEYS (BEFORE AND AFTER RETREAT, AND 1 MONTH LATER) TO ASSESS ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, FOCUS, WELL-BEING, AND HAPPINESS THROUGH VALIDATED PSYCHOLOGICAL SCALES. VOLUNTARY BLOOD SAMPLING FOR BIOMARKER STUDIES WAS DONE BEFORE AND WITHIN A DAY AFTER THE RETREAT. THE BIOMARKERS ANANDAMIDE, 2-ARACHIDONOYLGLYCEROL (2-AG), 1-ARACHIDONOYLGLYCEROL (1-AG), DOCOSATETRAENOYLETHANOLAMIDE (DEA), OLEOYLETHANOLAMIDE (OLA), AND BDNF WERE EVALUATED. PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SCALES, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN ECBS AND BDNF. RESULTS: DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SCORES DECREASED WHILE FOCUS, HAPPINESS, AND POSITIVE WELL-BEING SCORES INCREASED IMMEDIATELY AFTER RETREAT FROM THEIR BASELINE VALUES (P < 0.001). ALL IMPROVEMENTS WERE SUSTAINED 1 MONTH AFTER BSP. ALL MAJOR ECBS INCLUDING ANANDAMIDE, 2-AG, 1-AG, DEA, AND BDNF INCREASED AFTER MEDITATION BY > 70% (P < 0.001). INCREASES OF >/=20% IN ANANDAMIDE, 2-AG, 1-AG, AND TOTAL AG LEVELS AFTER MEDITATION FROM THE BASELINE HAD WEAK CORRELATIONS WITH CHANGES IN HAPPINESS AND WELL-BEING. CONCLUSIONS: A SHORT MEDITATION EXPERIENCE IMPROVED FOCUS, HAPPINESS, AND POSITIVE WELL-BEING AND REDUCED DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY IN PARTICIPANTS FOR AT LEAST 1 MONTH. PARTICIPANTS HAD INCREASED BLOOD ECBS AND BDNF, SUGGESTING A ROLE FOR THESE BIOMARKERS IN THE UNDERLYING MECHANISM OF MEDITATION. MEDITATION IS A SIMPLE, ORGANIC, AND EFFECTIVE WAY TO IMPROVE WELL-BEING AND REDUCE DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY.	2020	

18 1754   9 PLACE OF NUTRITION IN YOGA. NUTRITION PLAYS A VERY VITAL ROLE IN OUR LIFE. YOGA AND AYURVEDA HAD LAID DOWN THE FOUNDATIONS OF DIETETICS. THE VALUABLE GUIDELINES REGARDING VARIOUS FOOD ARTICLES AND DIET FOR YOGA SADHAKA, TO ACHIEVE MAXIMUM BENEFITS, ARE GIVEN IN TRADITIONAL YOGA TEXTS LIKE HATHA PRADIPIKA AND GHERANDA SAMHITHA. NOW IS THE TIME TO EVALUATE THE PLACE OF NUTRITION IN YOGA AND TO STUDY HOW THE DIETETIC PRINCIPLES IN YOGA WILL HELP TO ERADICATE THE NATIONAL PROBLEM OF MAL-NUTRITION AND POVERTY WHICH IS THE PRESSING NEED OF THE MOMENT.	1990	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
19 1657  17 MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN AND INTEREST IN MEDITATION AND YOGA IN HOME HEALTH AIDES: EVIDENCE FROM THE HOME HEALTH OCCUPATIONS MUSCULOSKELETAL EXAMINATIONS (HHOME) STUDY. HOME HEALTHCARE AIDES (HHAS) ARE A GROWING U.S. WORKFORCE HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO WORKPLACE STRESSORS AND MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN. IN THE PRESENT STUDY WE: 1) EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATION OF MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN TO LIFE SATISFACTION AND EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION; AND 2) CHARACTERIZE INTEREST IN MEDITATION AND YOGA IN A SAMPLE OF HHAS. A NONPROBABILISTIC SAMPLE OF HHAS EMPLOYED AT HOME HEALTHCARE AGENCIES IN FLORIDA, MASSACHUSETTS, AND OREGON (N = 285 TOTAL) COMPLETED A SELF-ADMINISTERED QUESTIONNAIRE WITH STANDARD SURVEY MEASURES ON MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN LOCATION, DURATION, AND SEVERITY; LIFE SATISFACTION; EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION; AND INTEREST IN MEDITATION TECHNIQUES AND YOGA. AMONG HHAS RESPONDING, 48.4% REPORTED PAIN IN THE LAST 7 DAYS AND 46.6% REPORTED PAIN IN THE LAST 3 MONTHS. HOME HEALTHCARE AIDES WHO REPORTED CURRENT PAIN AND CHRONIC PAIN HAD A SIGNIFICANT (P < .05) DECREASE IN SATISFACTION WITH LIFE SCORE AND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION SCORE. THE MAJORITY OF HHAS REPORTED AN INTEREST IN LEARNING ABOUT THE BENEFITS (65.6%) AND PRACTICE (66.4%) OF MEDITATION AND A WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN A YOGA CLASS (59.2%) OR STRESS MANAGEMENT MEETING (59.1%). THE HHAS REPORTED BOTH ACUTE AND CHRONIC MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN THAT WAS CORRELATED WITH LOWER LIFE SATISFACTION AND GREATER EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION. MORE EFFORTS ARE NEEDED TO REDUCE THE SOURCES OF INJURY AND EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION.	2018

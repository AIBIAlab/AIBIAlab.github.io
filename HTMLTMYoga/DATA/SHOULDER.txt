1 2100 164 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON ARM VOLUME, STRENGTH, AND RANGE OF MOTION IN WOMEN AT RISK FOR BREAST CANCER-RELATED LYMPHEDEMA. OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY, SAFETY, AND INITIAL ESTIMATES OF EFFICACY OF A YOGA PROGRAM IN POSTOPERATIVE CARE FOR WOMEN AT HIGH RISK FOR BREAST CANCER-RELATED LYMPHEDEMA (BCRL). DESIGN: SINGLE-GROUP PRETEST-POST-TEST DESIGN. SETTINGS/LOCATION: PATIENTS WERE RECRUITED FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO CAROL FRANC BUCK BREAST CARE CENTER. SUBJECTS: TWENTY-ONE WOMEN WERE ENROLLED IN THE STUDY. WOMEN WERE >18 YEARS OF AGE, HAD UNDERGONE SURGICAL TREATMENT FOR BREAST CANCER, AND WERE AT HIGH RISK FOR BCRL. INTERVENTION: THE WOMEN PARTICIPATED IN AN ASHTANGA YOGA INTERVENTION FOR 8 WEEKS. SESSIONS CONSISTED OF ONCE/WEEK INSTRUCTOR-LED PRACTICE AND ONCE/WEEK HOME PRACTICE. PARTICULAR ATTENTION WAS GIVEN TO POSES THAT EMPHASIZED UPPER BODY STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY, WHILE AVOIDING SIGNIFICANT TIME WITH THE UPPER EXTREMITY (UE) IN A DEPENDENT POSITION. OUTCOME MEASURES: UE VOLUME WAS ASSESSED THROUGH CIRCUMFERENTIAL FOREARM MEASUREMENT, WHICH WAS CONVERTED TO VOLUME USING THE FORMULA FOR A TRUNCATED CONE. RANGE OF MOTION (ROM) WAS ASSESSED FOR THE SHOULDERS, ELBOWS, AND WRISTS, USING A STANDARD GONIOMETER. UE STRENGTH WAS ASSESSED FOR SHOULDER ABDUCTION, ELBOW FLEXION, WRIST FLEXION, AND GRIP USING A DYNAMOMETER. RESULTS: TWENTY WOMEN COMPLETED THE YOGA INTERVENTION, WITH 17 RETURNING FOR FINAL ASSESSMENT. MEAN AGE WAS 52 (+/-9.1) YEARS AND BODY MASS INDEX WAS 24.8 (+/-5.1) KG/M(2). POSTINTERVENTION, MEAN VOLUME IN THE AT-RISK UE WAS SLIGHTLY REDUCED (P = 0.397). ROM FOR SHOULDER FLEXION (P < 0.01) AND EXTERNAL ROTATION (P < 0.05) SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED BILATERALLY. SHOULDER ABDUCTION ROM SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED FOR THE UNAFFECTED LIMB (P = 0.001). FOLLOWING INTERVENTION, STRENGTH IMPROVED ON THE AFFECTED SIDE FOR SHOULDER ABDUCTION AND GRIP STRENGTH, AND BILATERALLY FOR ELBOW FLEXION (P < 0.05 FOR ALL). CONCLUSIONS: THESE PRELIMINARY FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA IS FEASIBLE AND SAFE FOR WOMEN WHO ARE AT RISK FOR BCRL AND MAY RESULT IN SMALL IMPROVEMENTS IN SHOULDER ROM AND UE STRENGTH.	2018	

2  992  30 EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA PRACTICE ON THE HEALTH-RELATED ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL FITNESS. TEN HEALTHY, UNTRAINED VOLUNTEERS (NINE FEMALES AND ONE MALE), RANGING IN AGE FROM 18-27 YEARS, WERE STUDIED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA PRACTICE ON THE HEALTH-RELATED ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL FITNESS, INCLUDING MUSCULAR STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE, FLEXIBILITY, CARDIORESPIRATORY FITNESS, BODY COMPOSITION, AND PULMONARY FUNCTION. SUBJECTS WERE REQUIRED TO ATTEND A MINIMUM OF TWO YOGA CLASSES PER WEEK FOR A TOTAL OF 8 WEEKS. EACH YOGA SESSION CONSISTED OF 10 MINUTES OF PRANAYAMAS (BREATH-CONTROL EXERCISES), 15 MINUTES OF DYNAMIC WARM-UP EXERCISES, 50 MINUTES OF ASANAS (YOGA POSTURES), AND 10 MINUTES OF SUPINE RELAXATION IN SAVASANA (CORPSE POSE). THE SUBJECTS WERE EVALUATED BEFORE AND AFTER THE 8-WEEK TRAINING PROGRAM. ISOKINETIC MUSCULAR STRENGTH FOR ELBOW EXTENSION, ELBOW FLEXION, AND KNEE EXTENSION INCREASED BY 31%, 19%, AND 28% (P<0.05), RESPECTIVELY, WHEREAS ISOMETRIC MUSCULAR ENDURANCE FOR KNEE FLEXION INCREASED 57% (P<0.01). ANKLE FLEXIBILITY, SHOULDER ELEVATION, TRUNK EXTENSION, AND TRUNK FLEXION INCREASED BY 13% (P<0.01), 155% (P<0.001), 188% (P<0.001), AND 14% (P<0.05), RESPECTIVELY. ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE MAXIMAL OXYGEN UPTAKE INCREASED BY 7% AND 6%, RESPECTIVELY (P<0.01). THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT REGULAR HATHA YOGA PRACTICE CAN ELICIT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE HEALTH-RELATED ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL FITNESS.

3  404  29 BIKRAM YOGA TRAINING AND PHYSICAL FITNESS IN HEALTHY YOUNG ADULTS. THERE HAS BEEN RELATIVELY LITTLE LONGITUDINAL CONTROLLED INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON GENERAL PHYSICAL FITNESS, DESPITE THE WIDESPREAD PARTICIPATION IN THIS FORM OF EXERCISE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS EXPLORATORY STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF SHORT-TERM BIKRAM YOGA TRAINING ON GENERAL PHYSICAL FITNESS. YOUNG HEALTHY ADULTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA TRAINING (N = 10, 29 +/- 6 YEARS, 24 SESSIONS IN 8 WEEKS) OR A CONTROL GROUP (N = 11, 26 +/- 7 YEARS). EACH YOGA TRAINING SESSION CONSISTED OF 90-MINUTE STANDARDIZED SUPERVISED POSTURES PERFORMED IN A HEATED AND HUMIDIFIED STUDIO. ISOMETRIC DEADLIFT STRENGTH, HANDGRIP STRENGTH, LOWER BACK/HAMSTRING AND SHOULDER FLEXIBILITY, RESTING HEART RATE AND BLOOD PRESSURE, MAXIMAL OXYGEN CONSUMPTION (TREADMILL), AND LEAN AND FAT MASS (DUAL-ENERGY X-RAY ABSORPTIOMETRY) WERE MEASURED BEFORE AND AFTER TRAINING. YOGA SUBJECTS EXHIBITED INCREASED DEADLIFT STRENGTH, SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED LOWER BACK/HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY, INCREASED SHOULDER FLEXIBILITY, AND MODESTLY DECREASED BODY FAT COMPARED WITH CONTROL GROUP. THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN HANDGRIP STRENGTH, CARDIOVASCULAR MEASURES, OR MAXIMAL AEROBIC FITNESS. IN SUMMARY, THIS SHORT-TERM YOGA TRAINING PROTOCOL PRODUCED BENEFICIAL CHANGES IN MUSCULOSKELETAL FITNESS THAT WERE SPECIFIC TO THE TRAINING STIMULUS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
4 2185  52 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SHOULDER AND SPINAL ACTIONS FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER-RELATED LYMPHOEDEMA OF THE ARM: A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: WE AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION ON THE SHOULDER AND SPINAL ACTIONS OF WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER-RELATED ARM LYMPHOEDEMA. METHOD: A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED PILOT TRIAL. THE INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 12) COMPLETED EIGHT WEEKS OF DAILY YOGA SESSIONS WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP (N = 11) CONTINUED WITH BEST CURRENT CARE INCLUDING INFORMATION ON COMPRESSION SLEEVES, SKIN CARE, RISKS OF TEMPERATURE VARIATIONS AND RECOMMENDED SAFE USE OF AFFECTED ARM. LUMBO-PELVIC POSTURE, RANGE OF MOTION (ROM) IN THE SHOULDER AND SPINE, AND STRENGTH IN SHOULDER AND PECTORAL MAJOR AND MINOR, AND SERRATUS ANTERIOR WERE TAKEN AT BASELINE, WEEK 8 AND AFTER A 4-WEEK FOLLOW-UP. OUTCOME ASSESSORS WERE BLINDED TO ALLOCATION. RESULTS: AT WEEK EIGHT THE INTERVENTION GROUP HAD AN IMPROVEMENT IN LUMBO-PELVIC POSTURE, AS INDICATED BY A REDUCTION IN PELVIC OBLIQUITY COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP (MEAN DIFFERENCE = -8.39 DEGREES , 95 % CI: -15.64 TO -1.13 DEGREES , P = 0.023). A SECONDARY FINDING WAS THAT STRENGTH IN SHOULDER ABDUCTION SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FOLLOWING THE YOGA INTERVENTION IN BOTH THE AFFECTED (9.5 KG; CI: 0.34 TO 18.66, P = 0.042) AND NON-AFFECTED ARM (11.58 KG; CI: 0.25 TO 22.91; P = 0.045). THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN GROUP CHANGES IN ANY ROM MEASURES AS A RESULT OF THE YOGA INTERVENTION. CONCLUSION: THIS PILOT STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT PARTICIPATION IN YOGA MAY PROVIDE BENEFITS FOR POSTURE AND STRENGTH IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER RELATED LYMPHOEDEMA. THE IMPROVEMENTS MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE FOCUS OF YOGA ON OVERALL POSTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL MOVEMENT PATTERNS. FURTHER TRIALS WITH LONGER INTERVENTION THAT FOLLOW THIS METHODOLOGY ARE WARRANTED.

5 2916  23 [THE EFFECT OF HATHA YOGA ON POOR POSTURE IN CHILDREN AND THE PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGIC CONDITION IN ADULTS]. HATHA YOGA'S EFFECTS ON THE POSTURE OF 15 TEN YEAR-OLD CHILDREN AND ALSO ITS EFFECTS ON THE PSYCHOPHYSICAL CONDITION OF 15 GROWN-UPS WAS STUDIED. AS SYMPTOMS, DURING THE FIRST EXAMINATION, 12 OF THE 15 CHILDREN HAD HEAD PROTRUSION, 14 HAD SHORTENED BACK EXTENSORS, ALL 15 HAD BENT SHOULDERS, RELAXATION OF THE FRONTAL ABDOMINAL WALL AND SHORTENED FLEXORS OF BOTH THE CALF AND THIGH. THE CONDITION OF ALL THE CHILDREN WAS REMARKABLY BETTER AFTER SIX MONTHS OF PRACTICE, SOME OF THE SYMPTOMS HAVING COMPLETELY DISAPPEARED (HEAD PROTRUSION, ASYMMETRY OF THE SHOULDERS, MAMILLAS AND HIPS, SHORTENING OF THE PECTORALIS AND BACK EXTENSORS), 9 CHILDREN STILL HAD SLIGHT TO MEDIUM RELAXATION OF THE FRONTAL ABDOMINAL WALL, 8 CHILDREN STILL HAD BENT SHOULDERS, AND 1 CHILD STILL HAD SHORTENED CALF AND THIGH EXTENSORS. THE ADULTS WERE IN A WEAK OR VERY WEAK PSYCHOPHYSICAL CONDITION, THEY TIRED EASILY, THEY COMPLAINED OF SLEEP DISTURBANCES, FLUCTUATION OF EMOTIONAL STATE AND IRRITABILITY. AFTER 3 MONTHS OF PRACTICE, THE VITAL CAPACITY OF 8 OF THE ADULTS TESTED (53.3%) HAD INCREASED BY 435 ML. THE TIME DURATION OF APNOEA HAD LENGTHENED FOR ALL OF THE PRACTICING ADULTS, BUT WITH A TRULY LARGE VARIATION AMONG THEM (A MEDIAN OF 14%). THE DEEP WAIST-BEND LENGTH OF ALL THE PRACTICING ADULTS HAD LENGTHENED BY AN AVERAGE OF 9.5 CM, AND THE AVERAGE LENGTH INCREASE FOR THE 3-MINUTE RUNNING TEST WAS 42 M. ALL THOSE WHO PRACTICED, HAD EXPERIENCED AN ALLEVIATION OF PSYCHIC DIFFICULTIES.	1990	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
6  987  38 EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA EXERCISES ON SPINE FLEXIBILITY IN WOMEN OVER 50 YEARS OLD. [PURPOSE] THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ACCESS THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE SPINE IN WOMEN PRACTICING YOGA AS A PART OF THE "UNIVERSITY FOR HEALTH" PROJECT. [SUBJECTS AND METHODS] THE STUDY INCLUDED 56 WOMEN RANGING IN AGE BETWEEN 50-79 AND ATTENDING 90 MINUTES HATHA YOGA SESSIONS ONCE A WEEK. THE MEASUREMENTS WERE PERFORMED TWICE-AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PROJECT AND AFTER ITS COMPLETION, I.E., AFTER 20 WEEKS OF CLASSES. THE RANGE OF SPINE MOBILITY IN THREE PLANES WAS MEASURED USING A RIPPSTEIN PLURIMETER. THE RANGE OF MOTION IN THE SAGITTAL AND FRONTAL PLANES WAS MEASURED IN A STANDING POSITION WITH THE FEET HIP-WIDTH APART. THE TORSIONAL RANGE OF MOTION OF THE SUBJECTS WAS MEASURED WITH THE TRUNK BENT AT A RIGHT ANGLE AND THE LEGS APART. THE FLEXIBILITY RANGES OF THE SPINE AND HAMSTRINGS WERE ALSO MEASURED BY THE TOE-TOUCH TEST IN A STANDING POSITION. [RESULTS] THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT THE APPLIED YOGA EXERCISES INCREASED SPINAL MOBILITY AND FLEXIBILITY OF THE HAMSTRING MUSCLES REGARDLESS OF AGE. [CONCLUSION] YOGA EXERCISES SHOULD BE RECOMMENDED TO THE ELDERLY TO MAKE THEIR MUSCLES MORE FLEXIBLE AND TO INCREASE THE RANGE OF MOTION IN THE JOINTS, WHICH IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR IMPROVING THEIR LIFE QUALITY.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
7 1948  25 SCAPULAR MUSCLE ACTIVITY DURING STATIC YOGA POSTURES. STUDY DESIGN CONTROLLED, CROSS-SECTIONAL LABORATORY STUDY. BACKGROUND DESPITE THE GROWING POPULARITY OF YOGA, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE MUSCLE ACTIVITY OF THE SCAPULAR STABILIZERS DURING ISOMETRIC YOGA POSTURES AND THEIR POTENTIAL UTILITY IN SHOULDER REHABILITATION. OBJECTIVES TO EXAMINE SCAPULAR STABILIZER MUSCLE ACTIVATION DURING VARIOUS YOGA POSTURES. METHODS TWENTY WOMEN WITH YOGA EXPERIENCE AND NO SHOULDER PAIN OR INJURY PARTICIPATED. ELECTROMYOGRAPHY WAS USED TO RECORD THE MUSCLE ACTIVITY OF THE UPPER, MIDDLE, AND LOWER TRAPEZIUS, AS WELL AS OF THE SERRATUS ANTERIOR, DURING 15 YOGA POSTURES. RESULTS MUSCLE ACTIVITY VARIED BETWEEN YOGA POSTURES (3%-57% MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY ISOMETRIC CONTRACTION [MVIC]). OVERALL, THE "LOCUST ARMS FORWARD" POSTURE ELICITED THE HIGHEST ACTIVITY FROM THE UPPER (22.4% MVIC), MIDDLE (41.8% MVIC), AND LOWER (56.8% MVIC) TRAPEZIUS, WHILE SEVERAL POSTURES ELICITED MODERATE ACTIVITY (GREATER THAN 20% MVIC) FROM THE SERRATUS ANTERIOR. CONVERSELY, THE "DANCER'S POSE RIGHT," "REVERSE TABLETOP," AND "WARRIOR II" POSTURES DEMONSTRATED LOW ACTIVITY (LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 15.7% MVIC) OF THE SCAPULAR STABILIZERS. CONCLUSION STRENGTHENING THE SCAPULAR STABILIZER MUSCLES IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF SHOULDER REHABILITATION. YOGA POSTURES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED THAT ACTIVATE THE SCAPULAR STABILIZER MUSCLES AT VARYING LEVELS OF ACTIVITY. J ORTHOP SPORTS PHYS THER 2018;48(6):504-509. EPUB 6 APR 2018.

8 2791  32 YOGA THERAPY FOR BREAST CANCER PATIENTS: A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY. WE SOUGHT TO STUDY THE IMPACT OF YOGA THERAPY ON ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND PHYSICAL HEALTH IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. STAGE I-III POST-OPERATIVE BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WERE RECRUITED WITH TWELVE 1-H WEEKLY YOGA SESSIONS COMPLETED WITH AN EXPERIENCED YOGA INSTRUCTOR. BEFORE AND AFTER EACH MODULE COMPLETION, ASSESSMENTS WERE OBTAINED WITH THE HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE (HADS), THE DALLAS PAIN SCALE AND SHOULDER FLEXIBILITY MEASUREMENTS. FOURTEEN PATIENTS COMPLETED THE ENTIRE YOGA SESSION WITH 42.8% HAVING A TOTAL MASTECTOMY AND 15.4% HAVING BREAST RECONSTRUCTION. BOTH RIGHT AND LEFT SHOULDER ABDUCTION FLEXIBILITY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED (P = 0.004; P = 0.015 RESPECTIVELY) AS WELL AS LEFT SHOULDER FLEXION (P = 0.046). AN IMPROVEMENT TREND IN SCORES FOR THE HADS AND DALLAS QUESTIONNAIRES PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION WAS FOUND, ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. OUR DATA INDICATES AN IMPROVEMENT IN PHYSICAL FUNCTION IN ADDITION TO A CONSISTENT AMELIORATION IN ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND PAIN SYMPTOMS AFTER A YOGA INTERVENTION.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
9 2070  32 THE EFFECT OF A HATHA YOGA PRACTICE ON HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY. PURPOSE: TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF A 7-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION ON HAMSTRINGS FLEXIBILITY USING A DIGITAL GONIOMETER. IT WAS HYPOTHESIZED THAT HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY WILL INCREASE IN A YOUNG HEALTHY ADULT POPULATION. METHODS: THIRTY-ONE COLLEGE-AGED MALES AND FEMALES (MAGE= 21 +/- 2.62) YEARS PARTICIPATED IN 110 MINUTES TWICE PER WEEK FOR A 7-WEEK PROGRESSIVE YOGA INTERVENTION. PRE AND POST-TEST MEASUREMENTS WERE TAKEN TO DETERMINE HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT LEG USING A DIGITAL GONIOMETER. RESULTS: A PAIRED SAMPLES T-TEST INDICATED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE PRE AND POST-TEST ON HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY (P < .05). RESULTS FOR THE RIGHT LEG PRE-TEST (T(30) = -6.64, P <0.05, 95% CI (-6.14, -3.25), D = 0.77. P < 0.05 AS WELL AS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE LEFT PRE AND POST-ROM (T(30) = -6.93, P <0.05, 95% CI (-2.97, -6.79), D = 0.52, P < 0.05 INDICATED AN IMPROVEMENT AFTER THE INTERVENTION. AVERAGE RANGE OF MOTION INCREASE WAS 4 DEGREES IN BOTH LEGS. CONCLUSION: HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY CAN BE IMPROVED WITH A PROGRESSIVE 7-WEEK HATHA YOGA SESSION AND MAY BE USED AS A MODALITY TO IMPROVE FLEXIBILITY AND FUNCTION IN ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING AS WELL AND ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
10 2399  36 YOGA AND CUTANEOUS FUNCTIONAL UNIT RECRUITMENT FOR A PATIENT WITH CERVICAL AND UPPER EXTREMITY BURN SCAR CONTRACTURE: CASE REPORT. BURN SCAR CONTRACTURE GREATLY LIMITS FUNCTION FOR BURN SURVIVORS, PARTICULARLY WHEN THE SCARRING CROSSES MULTIPLE JOINTS. PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS IDENTIFIED FIELDS OF SKIN RECRUITED DURING SINGLE JOINT MOTION, CALLED CUTANEOUS FUNCTIONAL UNITS (CFU), INDICATING THAT IMPAIRMENTS MAY BE SEEN DISTAL TO THE INJURED TISSUE. THIS CASE REPORT CONNECTS THE PRINCIPLES OF CFU AND YOGA-INSPIRED THERAPY MODALITIES IN IMPROVING CLINICAL OUTCOMES FOR A BURN SURVIVOR. THE PATIENT IS A 38-YEAR-OLD MALE WHO SUSTAINED DEEP PARTIAL-THICKNESS ELECTRICAL BURNS TO HIS NECK, CHEST, AND BILATERAL UPPER EXTREMITIES, PRESENTING WITH SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED RANGE OF MOTION. THE PATIENT ATTENDED PHYSICAL THERAPY 4 DAYS A WEEK, WHERE HE PERFORMED A SPECIFIC YOGA ASANA PROGRAM DURING EACH SESSION. OUTCOMES INCLUDING STANDARD RANGE OF MOTION MEASURES, THE VANCOUVER SCAR SCALE (VSS), AND THE NECK DISABILITY INDEX (NDI), WHICH WERE RECORDED EVERY 10 SESSIONS. CFUS OF CERVICAL EXTENSION AND SHOULDER FLEXION WERE ANALYZED VIA PHOTOGRAPHS COMPARING CUTANEOUS POSITION DURING SPECIFIED YOGA POSES AND RESTING ANATOMICAL POSITION IN STANDING. OVER 30 VISITS, CERVICAL AND SHOULDER RANGE OF MOTION INCREASED, ALTHOUGH THE VSS AND NDI DID NOT SHOW SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. YOGA POSES SHOWED OVERALL CUTANEOUS RECRUITMENT DISTAL TO THE TARGETED JOINTS, AND BURNED SKIN WAS RECRUITED SIMILARLY TO NONBURNED SKIN IN POSITIONS OF STRETCH. INCORPORATING MULTIJOINT APPROACHES FOR STRETCHING, LIKE YOGA, APPEARS TO CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVED CLINICAL RANGE-OF-MOTION OUTCOMES WHEN PAIRED WITH TRADITIONAL BURN-REHABILITATION INTERVENTIONS. YOGA POSES INVOLVING MULTIPLE JOINTS ALIGN WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF CFUS, WARRANTING CONTINUED INVESTIGATION.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
11  322  34 ANKLE MOTION IN COMMON YOGA POSES. BACKGROUND: MOTION OF THE ANKLE IS ESSENTIAL FOR MANY YOGA POSES. AN UNDERSTANDING OF RANGE OF ANKLE MOTION DURING TYPICAL YOGA POSES MAY HELP THE CLINICIAN TO UNDERSTAND EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF PATIENTS WHEN RETURNING FROM ANKLE SURGERY OR INJURY TO YOGA. METHODS: THE BIOMECHANICS OF TWENTY HEALTHY ACTIVE YOGIS WERE COLLECTED DURING SEVEN YOGA POSES THAT ARE COMMON WITHIN THEIR PRACTICES. MOTION CAPTURE AND FORCE PLATES WERE USED TO ASSESS THE RANGE OF MOTION AND JOINT MOMENTS OF THE ANKLE FOR EACH POSE. RESULTS: ALL POSES RESULTED IN PLANTARFLEXION AND EXTERNAL ROTATION MOMENTS AT THE ANKLE JOINTS. JOINT LOADING WAS HIGHEST IN SINGLE LEG POSES. THE ARC OF MOTION USED BY THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS IN THE POSES WAS 29 DEGREES OF SAGITTAL MOTION, 20 DEGREES OF FRONTAL MOTION AND 35 DEGREES OF TRANSVERSE MOTION. DISCUSSION: ANKLE MOTION WAS EVALUATED WHEN HEALTHY YOGIS PERFORM STANDARD POSES. THESE RESULTS MAY HELP IN DISCUSSION WITH PATIENTS REGARDING EXPECTED OUTCOMES AFTER ANKLE INJURY OR SURGERY.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
12 1047  39 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON ARM VOLUME AMONG WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER RELATED LYMPHEDEMA: A PILOT STUDY. LYMPHEDEMA AFFECTS 3-58% OF SURVIVORS OF BREAST CANCER AND CAN RESULT IN UPPER EXTREMITY IMPAIRMENTS. EXERCISE CAN BE BENEFICIAL IN MANAGING LYMPHEDEMA. YOGA PRACTICE HAS BEEN MINIMALLY STUDIED FOR ITS EFFECTS ON BREAST CANCER RELATED LYMPHEDEMA (BCRL). THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON ARM VOLUME, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), SELF-REPORTED ARM FUNCTION, AND HAND GRIP STRENGTH IN WOMEN WITH BCRL. SIX WOMEN WITH BCRL PARTICIPATED IN MODIFIED HATHA YOGA 3X/WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS. COMPRESSION SLEEVES WERE WORN DURING YOGA SESSIONS. ARM VOLUME, QOL, SELF-REPORTED ARM FUNCTION, AND HAND GRIP STRENGTH WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE, HALF-WAY, AND AT THE CONCLUSION OF YOGA PRACTICE. ARM VOLUME SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED FROM BASELINE (2423.3 ML +/- 597.2) TO FINAL MEASURES (2370.8 ML +/- 577.2) (P = .02). NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN QOL (P = .12), SELF-REPORTED ARM FUNCTION (P = .34), OR HAND GRIP STRENGTH (P = .26) WERE FOUND. YOGA MAY BE BENEFICIAL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF LYMPHEDEMA.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
13 1263  41 FLEXIBILITY OF THE ELDERLY AFTER ONE-YEAR PRACTICE OF YOGA AND CALISTHENICS. FLEXIBILITY TRAINING RESPONSES TO DISTINCT STRETCHING TECHNIQUES ARE NOT WELL DEFINED, ESPECIALLY IN THE ELDERLY. THIS STUDY COMPARED THE FLEXIBILITY OF ELDERLY INDIVIDUALS BEFORE AND AFTER HAVING PRACTICED HATHA YOGA AND CALISTHENICS FOR 1 YEAR (52 WEEKS), AT LEAST 3 TIMES/WEEK. SIXTY-SIX SUBJECTS (12 MEN) MEASURED AND ASSIGNED TO 3 GROUPS: CONTROL (N = 24, AGE = 67.7+/-6.9 YEARS), HATHA YOGA (N = 22, AGE = 61.2+/-4.8 YEARS), AND CALISTHENICS (N = 20, AGE = 69.0+/-5.8 YEARS). THE MAXIMAL RANGE OF PASSIVE MOTION OF 13 MOVEMENTS IN 7 JOINTS WAS ASSESSED BY THE FLEXITEST, COMPARING THE RANGE OBTAINED WITH STANDARD CHARTS REPRESENTING EACH ARC OF MOVEMENT ON A DISCONTINUOUS AND NON-DIMENSIONAL SCALE FROM 0 TO 4. RESULTS OF INDIVIDUAL MOVEMENTS WERE SUMMED TO DEFINE 4 INDEXES (ANKLE+KNEE, HIP+TRUNK, WRIST+ELBOW, AND SHOULDER) AND TOTAL FLEXIBILITY (FLEXINDEX). RESULTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT INCREASES OF TOTAL FLEXIBILITY IN THE HATHA YOGA GROUP (BY 22.5 POINTS) AND THE CALISTHENICS GROUP (BY 5.8 POINTS) (P < 0.01 FOR EACH) AND A DECREASE IN THE CONTROL GROUP (BY 2.1 POINTS) (P < 0.01) AFTER ONE YEAR OF INTERVENTION. BETWEEN-GROUP COMPARISON SHOWED THAT INCREASES IN THE HATHA YOGA GROUP WERE GREATER THAN IN THE CALISTHENICS GROUP FOR MOST FLEXIBILITY INDEXES, PARTICULARLY THE OVERALL FLEXIBILITY (P <0.05). IN CONCLUSION, THE PRACTICE OF HATHA YOGA (I.E., SLOW/PASSIVE MOVEMENTS) WAS MORE EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING FLEXIBILITY COMPARED TO CALISTHENICS (I.E., FAST/DYNAMIC MOVEMENTS), BUT CALISTHENICS WAS ABLE TO PREVENT FLEXIBILITY LOSSES OBSERVED IN SEDENTARY ELDERLY SUBJECTS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
14  854  33 EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE MYOFASCIAL PAIN SYNDROME OF NECK. MYOFASCIAL PAIN SYNDROME (MPS) REFERS TO PAIN ATTRIBUTED TO MUSCLE AND ITS SURROUNDING FASCIA, WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH "MYOFASCIAL TRIGGER POINTS" (MTRPS). MTRPS IN THE TRAPEZIUS HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS THE MAIN CAUSE OF TEMPORAL AND CERVICOGENIC HEADACHE AND NECK PAIN. LITERATURE SHOWS THAT THE PREVALENCE OF VARIOUS MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS (MSD) AMONG PHYSIOTHERAPISTS IS HIGH. YOGA HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN USED TO TREAT MSDS IN VARIOUS POPULATIONS. BUT THERE IS SCARCITY OF LITERATURE WHICH EXPLAINS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON REDUCING MPS OF THE NECK IN TERMS OF VARIOUS PHYSICAL PARAMETERS AND SUBJECTIVE RESPONSES. THEREFORE, A PILOT STUDY WAS DONE AMONG EIGHT PHYSIOTHERAPISTS WITH MINIMUM SIX MONTHS OF EXPERIENCE. A STRUCTURED YOGA PROTOCOL WAS DESIGNED AND IMPLEMENTED FOR FIVE DAYS IN A WEEK FOR FOUR WEEKS. THE OUTCOME VARIABLES WERE DISABILITY OF ARM, SHOULDER AND HANDS (DASH) SCORE, NECK DISABILITY INDEX (NDI), VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS), PRESSURE PAIN THRESHOLD (PPT) FOR TRIGGER POINTS, CERVICAL RANGE OF MOTION (CROM) - ACTIVE & PASSIVE, GRIP AND PINCH STRENGTHS. THE VARIABLES WERE COMPARED BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION. FINALLY, THE RESULT REVEALED THAT ALL THE VARIABLES (DASH: P<0.00, NDI: P<0.00, VAS: P<0.00, PPT: LEFT: P<0.00, PPT: RIGHT: P<0.00, GRIP STRENGTH: LEFT: P<0.00, GRIP STRENGTH: RIGHT: P<0.01, KEY PINCH: LEFT: P<0.01, KEY PINCH: RIGHT: P<0.01, PALMAR PINCH: LEFT: P<0.01, PALMAR PINCH: RIGHT: P<0.00, TIP PINCH: LEFT: P<0.01, TIP PINCH: RIGHT: P<0.01) IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER INTERVENTION.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
15 2777  32 YOGA SPINAL FLEXION POSITIONS AND VERTEBRAL COMPRESSION FRACTURE IN OSTEOPENIA OR OSTEOPOROSIS OF SPINE: CASE SERIES. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS REPORT IS TO RAISE AWARENESS OF THE EFFECT OF STRENUOUS YOGA FLEXION EXERCISES ON OSTEOPENIC OR OSTEOPOROTIC SPINES. WE PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED SUBJECTS WITH KNOWN OSTEOPOROSIS IN WHOM VERTEBRAL COMPRESSION FRACTURES (VCFS) DEVELOPED AFTER SPINAL FLEXION EXERCISE (SFE) AND RECOMMENDED THAT SFES NOT BE PRESCRIBED IN PATIENTS WITH SPINAL OSTEOPOROSIS. METHODS: THIS REPORT DESCRIBES 3 HEALTHY PERSONS WITH LOW BONE MASS AND YOGA-INDUCED PAIN OR FRACTURE. RESULTS: ALL 3 PATIENTS HAD OSTEOPENIA, WERE IN GOOD HEALTH AND PAIN-FREE, AND HAD STARTED YOGA EXERCISES TO IMPROVE THEIR MUSCULOSKELETAL HEALTH. NEW PAIN AND FRACTURE AREAS OCCURRED AFTER PARTICIPATION IN YOGA FLEXION EXERCISES. CONCLUSIONS: THE DEVELOPMENT OF PAIN AND COMPLICATIONS WITH SOME FLEXION YOGA POSITIONS IN THE PATIENTS WITH OSTEOPENIA LEADS TO CONCERN THAT FRACTURE RISK WOULD INCREASE EVEN FURTHER IN OSTEOPOROSIS. ALTHOUGH EXERCISE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR IMPROVING BONE MINERAL DENSITY AND DECREASING FRACTURE RISK, OUR SUBJECTS HAD DEVELOPMENT OF VCFS AND NECK AND BACK PAIN WITH YOGA EXERCISES. THIS FINDING SUGGESTS THAT FACTORS OTHER THAN BONE MASS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FOR EXERCISE COUNSELING IN PATIENTS WITH BONE LOSS. THE INCREASED TORQUE PRESSURE APPLIED TO VERTEBRAL BODIES DURING SFES MAY BE A RISK. EXERCISE IS EFFECTIVE AND IMPORTANT FOR TREATMENT OF OSTEOPENIA AND OSTEOPOROSIS AND SHOULD BE PRESCRIBED FOR PATIENTS WITH VERTEBRAL BONE LOSS. SOME YOGA POSITIONS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO EXTREME STRAIN ON SPINES WITH BONE LOSS. ASSESSMENT OF FRACTURE RISK IN OLDER PERSONS PERFORMING SFES AND OTHER HIGH-IMPACT EXERCISES IS AN IMPORTANT CLINICAL CONSIDERATION.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
16 1947  37 SAUNA YOGA SUPERIORLY IMPROVES FLEXIBILITY, STRENGTH, AND BALANCE: A TWO-ARMED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IN HEALTHY OLDER ADULTS. BESIDES STRENGTH AND BALANCE, FLEXIBILITY IS AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF HEALTH-RELATED PHYSICAL FITNESS. THUS, THE AIM OF THIS TWO-ARMED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT TRIAL WAS TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER SAUNA YOGA AT A MODERATE TEMPERATURE (50 DEGREES C) BENEFICIALLY AFFECTS FLEXIBILITY, STRENGTH, BALANCE, AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) IN HEALTHY ELDERLY COMMUNITY DWELLERS. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO AN INTERVENTION GROUP (INT, N = 11, AGE: 68.7 +/- 5.9) OR CONTROL GROUP (CON, N = 12, AGE: 69.3 +/- 4.9), USING THE MINIMIZATION METHOD. AGE, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, GENDER, AND THE PRIMARY OUTCOME FLEXIBILITY WERE USED AS STRATA FOR GROUP ALLOCATION. BOTH GROUPS COMPLETED SIMILAR EXERCISES IN THE SAUNA OVER EIGHT WEEKS. ONLY THE INT GROUP WAS EXPOSED TO MODERATE TEMPERATURES OF 50 DEGREES C. LARGE AND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN FAVOR OF THE SAUNA GROUP (INT) WAS OBSERVED FOR THE CHAIR SIT-AND-REACH TEST (INT: +83%, CON +3%, P = 0.028, NSMALL ER, CYRILLIC(2) = 0.24). THE SHOULDER AND LATERAL SPINE FLEXIBILITY WERE NOT RELEVANTLY AFFECTED. STRENGTH IN THE LOWER EXTREMITIES MERELY SHOWED A TENDENCY TO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES (INT: 16%, CON: 3%, P = 0.061, NSMALL ER, CYRILLIC(2) = 0.181). ADDITIONALLY, BALANCE ABILITIES, WITH EYES CLOSED, IMPROVED (INT: 187%, CON +58%, P = 0.056, NSMALL ER, CYRILLIC(2) = 0.189) IN FAVOR OF THE INT GROUP. QOL ONLY IMPROVED IN FAVOR OF THE INT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL DIMENSION (INT: +7%, CON: 0%, P = 0.034, NSMALL ER, CYRILLIC(2) = 0.227). THESE FIRST BUT PRELIMINARY FINDINGS INDICATE THAT SAUNA YOGA MAY SERVE AS A PROMISING AND FEASIBLE MEANS TO IMPROVE FLEXIBILITY IN ELDERLY PEOPLE. STRENGTH AND BALANCE DO NOT MEANINGFULLY BENEFIT FROM A SAUNA ENVIRONMENT, ALTHOUGH STRENGTH IMPROVED TO A SLIGHTLY HIGHER EXTENT IN THE SAUNA GROUP. FUTURE LARGE-SCALE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO ELUCIDATE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS AND CORROBORATE THESE FINDINGS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                 
17 2152  29 THE EFFECTS OF SELECTED ASANAS IN IYENGAR YOGA ON FLEXIBILITY: PILOT STUDY. IN RECENT YEARS THE PRACTICE OF YOGA HAS GAINED POPULARITY AS A FORM OF PHYSICAL FITNESS AND EXERCISE, AND HAS BEEN SAID TO IMPROVE STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS RESEARCH PROJECT WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF A SIX WEEK IYENGAR YOGA INTERVENTION ON FLEXIBILITY. N = 16 LOW TO MODERATELY ACTIVE FEMALES (52.37 +/- 7.79 YEARS) ATTENDED IYENGAR YOGA PRACTICE FOR A TOTAL OF 6 WEEKS, CONSISTING OF ONE 90 MIN SESSION PER WEEK. LUMBAR AND HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY WERE ASSESSED PRE AND POST-INTERVENTION USING A STANDARD SIT AND REACH TEST. THE RESULTS SHOW A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN FLEXIBILITY, INDICATING 6 WEEKS OF SINGLE SESSION YOGA TRAINING MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN INCREASING ERECTOR SPINAE AND HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY. THIS IS IMPORTANT WHEN CONSIDERING THAT MUCH OF THE POPULATION FIND IT DIFFICULT TO ATTEND MORE THAN ONE SESSION A WEEK INTO THEIR TRAINING SCHEDULE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
18  573  18 DELAYED UNION OF STRESS FRACTURE OF THE FIRST RIB IN A YOGA INSTRUCTOR: A CASE REPORT. CASE: WE DESCRIBE THE CASE OF A 38-YEAR-OLD WOMAN, A YOGA INSTRUCTOR, WHO HAD PAIN IN THE RIGHT SHOULDER AND SCAPULAR REGION OF 4 MONTHS' DURATION WHILE PERFORMING YOGA. RADIOGRAPHY AND COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY DIAGNOSED DELAYED UNION OF A FIRST RIB STRESS FRACTURE. THE DELAYED UNION OF STRESS FRACTURE OF THE FIRST RIB WAS SUCCESSFULLY TREATED WITH THE LIMITING OF YOGA ACTIVITY AND LOW-INTENSITY PULSED ULTRASOUND (LIPUS). CONCLUSIONS: PHYSICIANS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT EVEN YOGA POSING CAN CAUSE STRESS FRACTURES OF THE FIRST RIB. LIPUS THERAPY MAY BE EFFECTIVE FOR DELAYED UNION IN ADDITION TO REST.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
19  292  25 ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF PUBLISHED CASE REPORTS AND CASE SERIES. WHILE YOGA IS GAINING INCREASED POPULARITY IN NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE, ITS SAFETY HAS BEEN QUESTIONED IN THE LAY PRESS. THE AIM OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS TO ASSESS PUBLISHED CASE REPORTS AND CASE SERIES ON ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA. MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, CAMBASE, INDMED AND THE CASES DATABASE WERE SCREENED THROUGH FEBRUARY 2013; AND 35 CASE REPORTS AND 2 CASE SERIES REPORTING A TOTAL OF 76 CASES WERE INCLUDED. TEN CASES HAD MEDICAL PRECONDITIONS, MAINLY GLAUCOMA AND OSTEOPENIA. PRANAYAMA, HATHA YOGA, AND BIKRAM YOGA WERE THE MOST COMMON YOGA PRACTICES; HEADSTAND, SHOULDER STAND, LOTUS POSITION, AND FORCEFUL BREATHING WERE THE MOST COMMON YOGA POSTURES AND BREATHING TECHNIQUES CITED. TWENTY-SEVEN ADVERSE EVENTS (35.5%) AFFECTED THE MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM; 14 (18.4%) THE NERVOUS SYSTEM; AND 9 (11.8%) THE EYES. FIFTEEN CASES (19.7%) REACHED FULL RECOVERY; 9 CASES (11.3%) PARTIAL RECOVERY; 1 CASE (1.3%) NO RECOVERY; AND 1 CASE (1.3%) DIED. AS ANY OTHER PHYSICAL OR MENTAL PRACTICE, YOGA SHOULD BE PRACTICED CAREFULLY UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF A QUALIFIED INSTRUCTOR. BEGINNERS SHOULD AVOID EXTREME PRACTICES SUCH AS HEADSTAND, LOTUS POSITION AND FORCEFUL BREATHING. INDIVIDUALS WITH MEDICAL PRECONDITIONS SHOULD WORK WITH THEIR PHYSICIAN AND YOGA TEACHER TO APPROPRIATELY ADAPT POSTURES; PATIENTS WITH GLAUCOMA SHOULD AVOID INVERSIONS AND PATIENTS WITH COMPROMISED BONE SHOULD AVOID FORCEFUL YOGA PRACTICES.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
20 2712  39 YOGA LEADS TO MULTIPLE PHYSICAL IMPROVEMENTS AFTER STROKE, A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS CHANGE IN PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING (PAIN, RANGE OF MOTION (ROM), STRENGTH, AND ENDURANCE) AFTER 8 WEEKS OF THERAPEUTIC-YOGA. DESIGN: PLANNED ANALYSES OF DATA FROM A RANDOMIZED PILOT STUDY OF YOGA AFTER STROKE. SETTING: UNIVERSITY-BASED RESEARCH LABORATORY. PARTICIPANTS: PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC STROKE (N=47) RANDOMIZED TO THERAPEUTIC-YOGA (N=37) OR WAIT-LIST CONTROL (N=10). INTERVENTIONS: 16 SESSIONS OF THERAPEUTIC YOGA (TWICE A WEEK/8 WEEKS). YOGA WAS DELIVERED IN A STANDARDIZED AND PROGRESSIVE FORMAT WITH POSTURES, BREATHING, AND MEDITATION, AND RELAXATION IN SITTING, STANDING, AND SUPINE. MAIN MEASURES: PAIN WAS ASSESSED WITH THE PEG, A 3-ITEM FUNCTIONAL MEASURE OF THE INTERFERENCE OF PAIN. ROM INCLUDED NECK AND HIP ACTIVE AND PASSIVE ROM MEASUREMENTS). UPPER AND LOWER EXTREMITY STRENGTH WERE ASSESSED WITH THE ARM CURL TEST AND CHAIR-TO-STAND TEST, RESPECTIVELY. ENDURANCE WAS ASSESSED WITH THE 6-MINUTE WALK AND MODIFIED 2-MIN STEP TEST. RESULTS: AFTER A BONFERRONI CORRECTION, PAIN, NECK ROM, HIP PASSIVE ROM, UPPER EXTREMITY STRENGTH, AND THE 6-MIN WALK SCORES ALL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED AFTER 8 WEEKS OF ENGAGING IN YOGA. NO CHANGES OCCURRED IN THE WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: A GROUP THERAPEUTIC-YOGA INTERVENTION MAY IMPROVE MULTIPLE ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING AFTER STROKE. SUCH AN INTERVENTION MAY BE COMPLEMENTARY TO TRADITIONAL REHABILITATION.	2014

1  722 136 EFFECT OF KARAMARDADI YOGA VERSUS DICLOFENAC SODIUM IN POST-OPERATIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT: A RANDOMIZED COMPARATIVE CLINICAL TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: POST-OPERATIVE PAIN IS NOCICEPTIVE I.E., ANTICIPATED UNAVOIDABLE PHYSIOLOGICAL PAIN WHICH IS CAUSED DUE TO TISSUE TRAUMA. DRUGS SUCH AS NSAIDS (NON STEROIDAL ANTI INFLAMMATORY DRUGS) AND OPIOIDS ARE USED FOR POST-OPERATIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT BUT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR OWN DRAWBACKS. KARAMARDADI YOGA HAS BEEN IN USE IN AYURVEDIC PRACTICE FOR ANALGESIA. IT IS KNOWN TO RELIEVE PAIN AND CAN BE USED TO SUPPLEMENT ANAESTHESIA AND ALSO GET RID OF ADVERSE EFFECT OF MODERN ANALGESIC DRUGS. AIMS AND OBJECTIVE: TO STUDY THE COMPARATIVE EFFECT OF KARAMARDADI YOGA AND DICLOFENAC SODIUM IN POST-OPERATIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL WITH GROUP A (CONTROL GROUP: TAB DICLOFENAC SODIUM 50 MG AS A SINGLE DOSE) AND GROUP B (TRIAL GROUP: CAP KARAMARDADI YOGA 500 MG AS A SINGLE DOSE). THOSE WHO HAD UNDERGONE HAEMORRHOIDECTOMY OPERATION UNDER LOCAL ANAESTHESIA WERE SELECTED AS PER INCLUSION CRITERIA. VITALS, DESIRABLE EFFECT AND UNDESIRABLE EFFECT, TOTAL SURGICAL TIME, REQUIREMENT OF 1(ST) DOSE OF ANALGESIC, REQUIREMENT OF RESCUE ANALGESIC AND PAIN DETERMINED BY VAS (VISUAL ANALOG SCALE) WERE THE ASSESSMENT CRITERIA AND WERE OBSERVED AND RECORDED. RESULTS: KARAMARDADI YOGA DOES NOT SHOW ANY UNDESIRABLE OR SERIOUS ILL EFFECTS AND ALTERED VALUES OF VITALS AS PER STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. AS PER VAS SCALE, PAIN FELT BY TRIAL GROUP WAS EARLIER THAN CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: KARAMARDADI YOGA HAS ANALGESIC PROPERTY BUT ITS ANALGESIC PROPERTY AND PAIN THRESHOLD CAPACITY IS LESSER THAN THOSE OF DICLOFENAC SODIUM.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
2 2326  37 TREATMENT OF PREGNANCY-RELATED LUMBAR AND PELVIC GIRDLE PAIN BY THE YOGA METHOD: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. OBJECTIVE: PREGNANCY-RELATED LUMBOPELVIC PAIN IS A MAJOR PROBLEM FOR THE MAJORITY OF PREGNANT WOMEN. COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE HAS BEEN USED TO ALLEVIATE PAIN, AND YOGA IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY CHOSEN ALTERNATIVE METHODS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HATHA YOGA IN THE REDUCTION OF LUMBOPELVIC PAIN IN PREGNANCY. METHODS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH 60 PREGNANT WOMEN (AGE RANGE, 14-40 YEARS) WHO REPORTED LUMBOPELVIC PAIN AT 12 TO 32 WEEKS OF GESTATION WAS CONDUCTED FROM JUNE 2009 TO JUNE 2011. PREGNANT WOMEN WHO HAD TWIN PREGNANCIES, HAD MEDICAL RESTRICTIONS FOR EXERCISE, USED ANALGESICS, AND PARTICIPATED IN PHYSICAL THERAPY WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE STUDY. PREGNANT WOMEN WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: THE YOGA GROUP, PRACTICING EXERCISES GUIDED BY THIS METHOD, AND THE POSTURAL ORIENTATION GROUP, PERFORMING STANDARDIZED POSTURE ORIENTATION ACCORDING TO INSTRUCTIONS PROVIDED IN A PAMPHLET. TREATMENT IN EACH GROUP LASTED 10 WEEKS. A VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS) WAS USED TO MEASURE PAIN INTENSITY. LUMBAR PAIN AND POSTERIOR PELVIC PAIN PROVOCATION TESTS WERE USED TO CONFIRM THE PRESENCE OF PAIN. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS INCLUDED THE MANN-WHITNEY TEST, THE MCNEMAR TEST, A PAIRED WILCOXON TEST, AND ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE. RESULTS: THE MEDIAN PAIN SCORE WAS LOWER IN THE YOGA GROUP (P<.0058) THAN THE POSTURAL ORIENTATION GROUP. LUMBAR PAIN PROVOCATION TESTS SHOWED A DECREASED RESPONSE IN RELATION TO POSTERIOR PELVIC PAIN PROVOCATION TESTS AND A GRADUAL REDUCTION IN PAIN INTENSITY DURING 10 YOGA SESSIONS (P<.024). CONCLUSIONS: THE YOGA METHOD WAS MORE EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING LUMBOPELVIC PAIN INTENSITY COMPARED WITH POSTURAL ORIENTATION.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
3 1797  40 PRENATAL YOGA: EFFECTS ON ALLEVIATION OF LABOR PAIN AND BIRTH OUTCOMES. BACKGROUND: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT PRENATAL YOGIC EXERCISES ARE EFFECTIVE IN ALLEVIATING LABOR PAIN AND IMPROVING BIRTH OUTCOMES, BY COMPARING PREGNANT WOMEN UNDERTAKING YOGA WITH A CONTROL GROUP. TRIAL DESIGN: SINGLE BLINDED, PARALLEL RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL. METHODS: TWO HUNDRED PRIMIGRAVID WOMEN OF 30 WEEKS OF GESTATION ONWARD WHO MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA (PRIMIGRAVIDA, 20-35 YEARS OF AGE, GESTATIONAL AGE OF 30 WEEKS, NO PRIOR EXPERIENCE OF YOGA) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO STUDY (N = 100) AND CONTROL GROUPS (N = 100) BY USING THE MINIMIZED RANDOMIZATION PROGRAM VERSION 2.01. THE STUDY GROUP RECEIVED THE INTERVENTION IN THE FORM OF INTEGRATED YOGA CONSISTING OF A SERIES OF 30-MIN PRACTICE SESSIONS AT THE 30TH, 32ND, 34TH, 36TH, 37TH, 38TH, AND 39TH WEEKS OF GESTATIONAL AGE. THE MATCHED CONTROL GROUP DID NOT PERFORM YOGA. THE PATIENTS WERE FOLLOWED TILL DELIVERY FOR MATERNAL COMFORT, ALLEVIATION OF LABOR PAIN, AND BIRTH OUTCOME. ALLEVIATION OF LABOR PAIN WAS ASSESSED BY USING NUMERICAL PAIN INTENSITY SCALE (NPIS), PAIN BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONAL SCALE (PBOS), AND MATERNAL DELIVERY COMFORT QUESTIONNAIRE. ONLY THE ASSESSORS WERE BLINDED. RESULTS: TWO HUNDRED PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO 100 EACH IN CASE AND CONTROL GROUPS. FINAL ANALYSIS WAS DONE ON 75 PATIENTS IN EACH GROUP AFTER EXCLUSION DUE TO DEVELOPMENT OF COMPLICATIONS, LOSS TO FOLLOW-UP. THE REQUIREMENT OF INDUCTION OF LABOR AND ANALGESICS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS IN THE STUDY GROUP (P < 0.044, P < 0.045). THERE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE NUMBER OF NORMAL VAGINAL DELIVERIES (P < 0.037) AND LESS CAESAREAN SECTIONS (P < 0.048), SHORTER FIRST STAGE OF LABOR (P < 0.0003) IN THE STUDY GROUP PRACTICING YOGA. THE TOLERANCE OF PAIN WAS BETTER IN THE STUDY GROUP AS SHOWN BY NPIS (P < 0.001) AND PBOS SCORES (P < 0.0001). POSTPARTUM, THE MATERNAL COMFORT QUESTIONNAIRE SCORE SHOWED HIGHER COMFORT IN THE STUDY GROUP (P < 0.032). THE NUMBER OF LOW BIRTH WEIGHT BABIES WAS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY LESS IN THE STUDY GROUP (P < 0.042). THERE WERE NO ADVERSE EFFECTS ATTRIBUTED TO YOGA. CONCLUSION: THE STUDY HAS HIGHLIGHTED THAT YOGA IS A NONINVASIVE, EASY TO LEARN MIND-BODY MEDICINE AND COMPLEMENTARY HEALTH PRACTICE, EFFECTIVE IN ALLEVIATION OF LABOR PAIN AND POSSIBLY IMPROVING BIRTH OUTCOME.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                      
4  740  26 EFFECT OF RAJYOGA MEDITATION ON CHRONIC TENSION HEADACHE. CHRONIC TENSION-TYPE HEADACHE (CTTH) IS THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF HEADACHE WITH NO TRULY EFFECTIVE TREATMENT. THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO CORRELATE THE ADDITIVE EFFECT OF MEDITATION ON CTTH PATIENTS RECEIVING MEDICAL TREATMENT. 50 PATIENTS (AGED 18-58 YEARS) PRESENTING WITH A CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS OF CCTH, WERE DIVIDED IN 2 GROUPS. GROUP 1 (N=30) RECEIVED 8 LESSONS AND PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATION OF BRAHMAKUMARIS SPIRITUAL BASED MEDITATION KNOWN AS RAJYOGA MEDITATION FOR RELAXATION THERAPY, IN ADDITION TO ROUTINE MEDICAL TREATMENT (ANALGESICS AND MUSCLE RELAXANTS). GROUP 2 (N=20) PATIENTS RECEIVED ANALGESICS AND MUSCLE RELAXANTS TWICE A DAY BUT NO RELAXATION THERAPY IN THE FORM OF MEDITATION. BOTH GROUPS WERE FOLLOWED UP FOR 8 WEEKS PERIOD. THE PARAMETERS STUDIED WERE SEVERITY, FREQUENCY AND DURATION OF CCTH, AND THEIR HEADACHE INDEX CALCULATED. PATIENTS IN BOTH GROUPS SHOWED A HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN HEADACHE VARIABLES (P<0.001) AFTER 8 WEEKS. BUT THE PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS SHOWING HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT RELIEF IN SEVERITY OF HEADACHE, DURATION & FREQUENCY IN GROUP 1 WAS 94%, 91% AND 97% RESPECTIVELY WHEREAS IN GROUP 2 IT WAS 36%, 36% AND 49% RESPECTIVELY. HEADACHE RELIEF AS CALCULATED BY HEADACHE INDEX WAS 99% IN GROUP 1 AS COMPARED TO 51% IN GROUP 2. EVEN SHORT TERM SPIRITUAL BASED RELAXATION THERAPY (RAJYOGA MEDITATION) WAS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN CAUSING EARLIER RELIEF IN CHRONIC TENSION HEADACHE AS MEASURED BY HEADACHE PARAMETER.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
5  688  40 EFFECT OF ANTENATAL EXERCISES, INCLUDING YOGA, ON THE COURSE OF LABOR, DELIVERY AND PREGNANCY: A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY. BACKGROUND: DELIVERING A CHILD IS A VERY STRESSFUL EXPERIENCE FOR WOMEN. PREGNANCY AND LABOR ENTAIL COMPLEX EVENTS THAT ARE UNIQUE TO EACH INDIVIDUAL FEMALE. THE MANAGEMENT OF LABOR PAIN IS OFTEN DONE USING ANALGESICS AND ANESTHESIA, WHICH HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE SOME SIDE EFFECTS. MORE COMPREHENSIVE DATA ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE FOR CLINICIANS TO CONFIDENTLY PRESCRIBE EXERCISES TO PATIENTS. THIS STUDY WAS DONE TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF ANTENATAL EXERCISES, INCLUDING YOGA, ON THE COURSE OF LABOR, DELIVERY, AND PREGNANCY OUTCOMES. METHODS: A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AMONG 200 PRIMIPAROUS SUBJECTS (AGED 20-40). A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS PROVIDED TO THE SUBJECTS TO OBTAIN THEIR DEMOGRAPHIC AND OBSTETRICAL INFORMATION 6 WEEKS AFTER DELIVERY, AND THEIR HOSPITAL RECORDS WERE ALSO ASSESSED FOR FURTHER DETAILS. BASED ON THE NATURE AND DETAILS OBTAINED FOR THE ANTENATAL EXERCISES, SUBJECTS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: CONTROL AND EXERCISE. OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED THE NEED FOR LABOR INDUCTION, SELF-PERCEIVED PAIN AND PERCEIVED EXERTION DURING LABOR, DURATION AND NATURE OF THE DELIVERY, NEWBORN INFANT WEIGHT, MATERNAL WEIGHT GAIN, HISTORY OF BACK PAIN, AND POST-PARTUM RECOVERY. THE TOTAL MATERNAL WEIGHT GAIN (IN KILOGRAMS) WAS CALCULATED FROM WEIGHT AT 6 WEEKS AFTER DELIVERY MINUS THE WEIGHT AT 12-14 WEEKS OF GESTATION. BACK PAIN DURING PREGNANCY AND SELF-PERCEIVED LABOR PAIN WERE MEASURED USING A VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS). THE OVERALL PERCEIVED EXERTION DURING LABOR WAS MEASURED USING AN ADAPTED BORG SCALE FOR PERCEIVED EFFORT. RESULTS: THE SUBJECTS WHO FOLLOWED REGULAR ANTENATAL EXERCISES, INCLUDING YOGA, HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER RATES OF CESAREAN SECTION, LOWER WEIGHT GAIN, HIGHER NEWBORN INFANT WEIGHT, LOWER PAIN AND OVERALL DISCOMFORT DURING LABOR, LOWER BACK PAIN THROUGHOUT PREGNANCY, AND EARLIER POST-PARTUM RECOVERY COMPARED TO THOSE WHO DID NO SPECIFIC EXERCISES OR ONLY WALKED DURING PREGNANCY. CONCLUSIONS: THIS RETROSPECTIVE STUDY SHOWED THAT REGULAR ANTENATAL EXERCISES, INCLUDING YOGA, RESULT IN BETTER OUTCOMES RELATED TO THE COURSE OF LABOR, DELIVERY, AND PREGNANCY. THESE RESULTS NOTABLY INDICATED THAT PREGNANT WOMEN SHOULD BE ACTIVE THROUGHOUT PREGNANCY AND FOLLOW A SUPERVISED EXERCISE PROGRAM THAT INCLUDES YOGA UNLESS CONTRAINDICATED. WE REQUIRE FURTHER LARGE-SCALE PROSPECTIVE STUDIES AND QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL TRIALS TO CONFIRM THE OBSERVED FINDINGS.	2020	

6 1476  28 INTEGRATED YOGA AND NATUROPATHY MODULE IN MANAGEMENT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME: A CASE REPORT. A 50-YEAR-OLD MALE PARTICIPANT WITH SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE, DIAGNOSED WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME (METS) [OBESITY, TYPE-2 DIABETES MELLITUS, HYPERTENSION] AND HYPOTHYROIDISM SINCE 2013, WAS ADMINISTERED INTEGRATED YOGA AND NATUROPATHY (IYN) FOR 6 WEEKS AS A TAILOR MADE INDIVIDUALIZED PROTOCOL AT THE RESIDENTIAL INTEGRATIVE MEDICAL FACILITY IN BANGALORE BETWEEN OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER 2015. THE RESULTS SHOWED REDUCTION IN WEIGHT (97.9 KG TO 74.6 KG), BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) (35.1 KG/M(2) TO 27.86 KG/M(2)), TOTAL CHOLESTEROL (192 MG% TO 145 MG%), TRIGLYCERIDES (153 MG% TO 90 MG%), LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (LDL) (124 MG% TO 81 MG%), HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (HDL) (40 MG% TO 46 MG%), FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE (110 MG/DL TO 75 MG/DL), POSTPRANDIAL GLUCOSE (267 MG/DL TO 100 MG/DL), GLYCATED HEMOGLOBIN (HBA1C) (7.8%-7.1%), THYROID STIMULATING HORMONE (TSH) (6.90 MUIU/ML TO 3.052 MUIU/ML). FOLLOWING THE INTERVENTION, THE ANTI-HYPERTENSIVE, ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC, THYROID RAISING AND ANALGESIC MEDICINES WERE NOT REQUIRED TO BE CONTINUED. HIS KNEE PAIN MINIMIZED ON DISCHARGE AS OBSERVED ON A VISUAL ANALOG SCALE. HE HAD AN IMPROVED FEELING OF WELLNESS AND OVERALL FUNCTIONAL HEALTH. ALL HIS PARAMETERS WERE WITHIN NORMAL RANGE AT THE 12-WEEKS FOLLOW-UP, AS HE HAD INCORPORATED THE LIFESTYLE PROGRAM INTO HIS DAILY ROUTINE. THIS CASE REPORT SUGGESTS THAT LIFESTYLE CHANGE BY INTEGRATION OF SPECIFIC NON-DRUG YOGA AND NATUROPATHIC INTERVENTION IS USEFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF METS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
7 1771  33 POTENTIAL ROLE OF YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS: A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY. BACKGROUND: ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS (AS) IS A CHRONIC AUTOIMMUNE INFLAMMATORY SPONDYLOARTHROPATHY WITH UNCLEAR PATHOGENESIS. THE INFLAMMATORY PAIN IN AS LEADS TO RESTRICTED SPINAL MOBILITY AND SIGNIFICANT DISABILITY. YOGA IS A NONPHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION THAT HAS POSITIVE EFFECTS ON VARIOUS MUSCULOSKELETAL-RELATED PROBLEMS. HOWEVER, ITS ROLE IN AS IS UNKNOWN. OBJECTIVE: THE PRESENT RETROSPECTIVE STUDY ASSESSED THE EFFICACY OF A TWO-WEEK RESIDENTIAL YOGA INTERVENTION ON SPINAL FLEXIBILITY AMONG AS PATIENTS. METHODS: THE RECORDS FOR 24 MALE AS PATIENTS WITHIN THE AGE RANGE 30 TO 50 YEARS (AVERAGE AGE 38.3 +/- 10.5 YEARS) WHO UNDERWENT A TWO-WEEK RESIDENTIAL YOGA RETREAT BETWEEN 2015 AND 2020 WERE OBTAINED FROM A YOGA CENTER LOCATED IN SOUTH INDIA. YOGA INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF YOGA POSTURES, BREATHING PRACTICES, MEDITATION, A HEALTHY DIET, AND DEVOTIONAL SESSIONS. PRE AND POST DATA OF THE SIT-AND-REACH TEST, BLOOD PRESSURE, HEART RATE, AND SYMPTOM SCORE WERE ANALYZED USING STATISTICAL PACKAGE FOR SOCIAL SCIENCES (SPSS). RESULTS: COMPARED TO THE BASELINE, THE POST SCORES OF THE SIT-AND-REACH TEST, SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEART RATE WERE FOUND TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY (P < .05) LOWER. THE SYMPTOM SCORE AND ANALGESIC MEDICATION SCORE ALSO SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT AFTER TWO-WEEKS COMPARED TO THE BASELINE. CONCLUSION: THIS RETROSPECTIVE STUDY INDICATES THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF ON AND ANALGESIC USE AMONG AS PATIENTS. HOWEVER, ADDITIONAL STUDIES USING ROBUST RESEARCH DESIGNS ARE WARRANTED.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
8   63  26 A COMPREHENSIVE YOGA PROGRAMS IMPROVES PAIN, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION IN CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN PATIENTS MORE THAN EXERCISE: AN RCT. INTRODUCTION: PREVIOUSLY, OUTPATIENT YOGA PROGRAMS FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) LASTING SEVERAL MONTHS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO REDUCE PAIN, ANALGESIC REQUIREMENT AND DISABILITY, AND IMPROVE SPINAL MOBILITY. THIS STUDY EVALUATED CHANGES IN PAIN, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND SPINAL MOBILITY FOR CLBP PATIENTS ON SHORT-TERM, RESIDENTIAL YOGA AND PHYSICAL EXERCISE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING COMPREHENSIVE YOGA LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS. METHODS: A SEVEN DAY RANDOMIZED CONTROL SINGLE BLIND ACTIVE STUDY IN AN RESIDENTIAL HOLISTIC HEALTH CENTRE IN BANGALORE, INDIA, ASSIGNED 80 PATIENTS (37 FEMALE, 43 MALE) WITH CLBP TO YOGA AND PHYSICAL EXERCISE GROUPS. THE YOGA PROGRAM CONSISTED OF SPECIFIC ASANAS AND PRANAYAMAS FOR BACK PAIN, MEDITATION, YOGIC COUNSELLING, AND LECTURES ON YOGA PHILOSOPHY. THE CONTROL GROUP PROGRAM INCLUDED PHYSICAL THERAPY EXERCISES FOR BACK PAIN, AND MATCHING COUNSELLING AND EDUCATION SESSIONS. RESULTS: GROUPXTIME INTERACTIONS (P<0.05) AND BETWEEN GROUP DIFFERENCES (P<0.05) WERE SIGNIFICANT IN ALL VARIABLES. BOTH GROUPS' SCORES ON THE NUMERICAL RATING SCALE FOR PAIN REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY, 49% IN YOGA (P<0.001, ES=1.62), 17.5% IN CONTROLS (P=0.005, ES=0.67). STATE ANXIETY (STAI) REDUCED 20.4% (P<0.001, ES=0.72) AND TRAIT ANXIETY 16% (P<0.001, ES=1.09) IN THE YOGA GROUP. DEPRESSION (BDI) DECREASED IN BOTH GROUPS, 47% IN YOGA (P<0.001, ES=0.96,) AND 19.9% IN CONTROLS (P<0.001, ES=0.59). SPINAL MOBILITY ('SIT AND REACH' INSTRUMENT) IMPROVED IN BOTH GROUPS, 50%, IN YOGA (P<0.001, ES=2.99) AND 34.6% IN CONTROLS (P<0.001, ES=0.81). CONCLUSION: SEVEN DAYS INTENSIVE RESIDENTIAL YOGA PROGRAM REDUCES PAIN, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION, AND IMPROVES SPINAL MOBILITY IN PATIENTS WITH CLBP MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN PHYSIOTHERAPY EXERCISES.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
9 1916  31 ROLE OF TEMPORALIS MUSCLE OVER ACTIVITY IN CHRONIC TENSION TYPE HEADACHE: EFFECT OF YOGA BASED MANAGEMENT. THE ROLE OF CENTRAL VERSUS PERIPHERAL MECHANISMS HAS ALWAYS BEEN QUESTIONED WHILE EXPLAINING THE ETIOPATHOGENESIS OF CHRONIC TENSION TYPE HEADACHE (CTTH). THE FOLLOWING STUDY WAS DONE TO STUDY THE ROLE OF MUSCLE SPASM IN CTTH. 15 PATIENTS OF CTTH AND 7 AGE MATCHED CONTROLS WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY AND THEIR M. TEMPORALIS EMG WAS RECORDED FOR ONE MINUTE EACH DURING REST, MENTAL ACTIVITY AND MAXIMAL VOLUNTARY CONTRACTION AND SUBJECTIVE PAIN SCORING WAS DONE BY VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE. THE RESULTS REVEALED SIGNIFICANT OVERACTIVITY OF M.TEMPORALIS IN CTTH PATIENTS AT REST WHEN COMPARED WITH CONTROL SUBJECTS (P = 0.01 AND 0.03 LEFT AND RIGHT SIDE RESPECTIVELY). AFTER RESPECTIVE INTERVENTIONS NAMELY NON STEROIDAL ANTI INFLAMMATORY DRUGS, BOTULINUM TOXIN INJECTIONS AND YOGIC LIFE STYLE COURSE, THE EMG RECORDS REVEALED DECREASE IN THE MEAN EMG AMPLITUDE OF M. TEMPORALIS DURING REST AND MENTAL ACTIVITY MORE SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER YOGA BASED INTERVENTIONS (P = 0.03) AND SUBJECTIVE PAIN SCORES DECREASED FROM 7.00 +/- 2.10 TO 2.00 +/- 1.26 (P = 0.02) SUPPORTING THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF SUCH NON INVASIVE TECHNIQUES.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
10 2524  23 YOGA DURING PREGNANCY: EFFECTS ON MATERNAL COMFORT, LABOR PAIN AND BIRTH OUTCOMES. THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA PROGRAM DURING PREGNANCY, ON MATERNAL COMFORT, LABOR PAIN, AND BIRTH OUTCOMES. A RANDOMIZED TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED USING 74-PRIMIGRAVID THAI WOMEN WHO WERE EQUALLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS (EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL). THE YOGA PROGRAM INVOLVED SIX, 1-H SESSIONS AT PRESCRIBED WEEKS OF GESTATION. A VARIETY OF INSTRUMENTS WERE USED TO ASSESS MATERNAL COMFORT, LABOR PAIN AND BIRTH OUTCOMES. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS FOUND TO HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF MATERNAL COMFORT DURING LABOR AND 2H POST-LABOR, AND EXPERIENCED LESS SUBJECT EVALUATED LABOR PAIN THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. IN EACH GROUP, PAIN INCREASED AND MATERNAL COMFORT DECREASED AS LABOR PROGRESSED. NO DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND, BETWEEN THE GROUPS, REGARDING PETHIDINE USAGE, LABOR AUGMENTATION OR NEWBORN APGAR SCORES AT 1 AND 5 MIN. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS FOUND TO HAVE A SHORTER DURATION OF THE FIRST STAGE OF LABOR, AS WELL AS THE TOTAL TIME OF LABOR.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
11 2558  33 YOGA FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN IN A PREDOMINANTLY MINORITY POPULATION: A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: SEVERAL STUDIES SUGGEST YOGA MAY BE EFFECTIVE FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN; HOWEVER, TRIALS TARGETING MINORITIES HAVE NOT BEEN CONDUCTED. PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVES: ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF STUDYING YOGA IN A PREDOMINANTLY MINORITY POPULATION WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. COLLECT PRELIMINARY DATA TO PLAN A LARGER POWERED STUDY. STUDY DESIGN: PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: TWO COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS IN A RACIALLY DIVERSE NEIGHBORHOOD OF BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS. PARTICIPANTS: THIRTY ENGLISH-SPEAKING ADULTS (MEAN AGE 44 YEARS, 83% FEMALE, 83% RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES; 48% WITH INCOMES < OR = $30,000) WITH MODERATE-TO-SEVERE CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. INTERVENTIONS: STANDARDIZED SERIES OF WEEKLY HATHA YOGA CLASSES FOR 12 WEEKS COMPARED TO A WAITLIST USUAL CARE CONTROL. OUTCOME MEASURES: FEASIBILITY MEASURED BY TIME TO COMPLETE ENROLLMENT, PROPORTION OF RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES ENROLLED, RETENTION RATES, AND ADVERSE EVENTS. PRIMARY EFFICACY OUTCOMES WERE CHANGES FROM BASELINE TO 12 WEEKS IN PAIN SCORE (0=NO PAIN TO 10=WORST POSSIBLE PAIN) AND BACK-RELATED FUNCTION USING THE MODIFIED ROLAND-MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE (0-23 POINT SCALE, HIGHER SCORES REFLECT POORER FUNCTION). SECONDARY EFFICACY OUTCOMES WERE ANALGESIC USE, GLOBAL IMPROVEMENT, AND QUALITY OF LIFE (SF-36). RESULTS: RECRUITMENT TOOK 2 MONTHS. RETENTION RATES WERE 97% AT 12 WEEKS AND 77% AT 26 WEEKS. MEAN PAIN SCORES FOR YOGA DECREASED FROM BASELINE TO 12 WEEKS (6.7 TO 4.4) COMPARED TO USUAL CARE, WHICH DECREASED FROM 7.5 TO 7.1 (P=.02). MEAN ROLAND SCORES FOR YOGA DECREASED FROM 14.5 TO 8.2 COMPARED TO USUAL CARE, WHICH DECREASED FROM 16.1 TO 12.5 (P=.28). AT 12 WEEKS, YOGA COMPARED TO USUAL CARE PARTICIPANTS REPORTED LESS ANALGESIC USE (13% VS 73%, P=.003), LESS OPIATE USE (0% VS 33%, P=.04), AND GREATER OVERALL IMPROVEMENT (73% VS 27%, P=.03). THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES IN SF-36 SCORES AND NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS. CONCLUSION: A YOGA STUDY INTERVENTION IN A PREDOMINANTLY MINORITY POPULATION WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN WAS MODERATELY FEASIBLE AND MAY BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN USUAL CARE FOR REDUCING PAIN AND PAIN MEDICATION USE.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
12 1698  25 PAIN-RELATED ENCEPHALIC REGIONS INFLUENCED BY YOGA MEDITATION: AN INTEGRATIVE REVIEW. INTRODUCTION: THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE USE OF YOGA IN PAIN RELIEF ARE STILL UNCLEAR. THIS STUDY REVIEWED LITERATURE REPORTS ON ENCEPHALIC ACTIVITY RELATED TO ANALGESIA INDUCED BY YOGA MEDITATION PRACTICE. METHODS: THIS INTEGRATIVE REVIEW EXAMINED STUDIES PUBLISHED IN THE PUBMED, LILACS AND MEDLINE DATABASES WITHOUT RESTRICTION OF THE YEAR OF PUBLICATION. THE RESEARCH INVOLVED 16 DESCRIPTORS RELATED TO THE WORDS: YOGA, PAIN AND NEUROIMAGING METHODS. INCLUSION CRITERIA INVOLVED ONLY THE PUBLICATIONS AVAILABLE ONLINE, WITH FREE ACCESS AND WRITTEN IN ENGLISH. RESULTS: 2 CASE STUDIES AND 1 PILOT STUDY MET THE CRITERIA. YOGA MEDITATION PRACTICE INDUCES ANALGESIA PRIMARILY THROUGH ATTENUATION OF THE MEDIAL PAIN PERCEPTION SYSTEM INCLUDING THE ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX AND INSULA REGIONS, AS WELL AS THE LATERAL SYSTEM INCLUDING THE SECONDARY SENSORY CORTEX AND THALAMUS. CONCLUSION: YOGA INDUCED ANALGESIA IS A POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT ADJUNCT TO CURRENT PAIN MANAGEMENT. THIS INTEGRATIVE REVIEW REVEALED THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR FURTHER RESEARCH THAT ANALYZES THE ENCEPHALIC REGIONS RELATED TO ANALGESIA INDUCED BY YOGA PRACTICE.	2018

14 2088  32 THE EFFECT OF PRACTICING YOGA DURING PREGNANCY ON LABOR STAGES LENGTH, ANXIETY AND PAIN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: ANXIETY AND FEAR OF LABOR PAIN HAS LED TO ELEVATED CESAREAN SECTION RATE IN SOME COUNTRIES. THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA IN PREGNANCY ON ANXIETY, LABOR PAIN AND LENGTH OF LABOR STAGES. METHODS: THIS CLINICAL TRIAL STUDY WAS PERFORMED ON 84 NULLIPAROUS WOMEN WHO WERE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OLD AND WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS OF YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS. PREGNANCY YOGA PROGRAM CONSISTING OF 6 60-MIN TRAINING SESSIONS WAS STARTED EVERY 2 WEEKS FROM WEEK 26 OF PREGNANCY AND CONTINUED UNTIL 37 WEEKS OF GESTATION. ANXIETY SEVERITY AT MATERNAL ADMISSION TO LABOR WAS MEASURED BY THE SPIELBERGERS STATE-TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY, AND LABOR PAIN WAS MEASURED BY VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS) AT DILATATION (4-5 CM) AND 2 H AFTER THE FIRST MEASUREMENT. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING CHI-SQUARE AND T-TEST. RESULTS: INTERVENTION GROUP REPORTED LESS PAIN AT DILATATION (4-5 CM) (P=0.001) AND 2 H AFTER THE FIRST MEASUREMENT (P=0.001) THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. STAT ANXIETY WAS ALSO LOWER IN INTERVENTION GROUP THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (P=0.003) AT THE ENTRANCE TO LABOR ROOM. SUBJECTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP REQUIRED MORE INDUCTION COMPARED TO INTERVENTION GROUP (P=0.003). WOMEN IN INTERVENTION GROUP EXPERIENCED SHORTER DURATION OF THE FIRST PHASE OF THE LABOR THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (P=0.002). ALSO, THE TOTAL DURATION OF TWO STAGES OF LABOR WAS SHORTER IN INTERVENTION GROUP THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: PRACTICING YOGA DURING PREGNANCY MAY REDUCE WOMEN'S ANXIETY DURING LABOR; SHORTEN LABOR STAGES, AND LOWER LABOR PAIN.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
15 1870  31 RANDOMIZED-CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING YOGA AND HOME-BASED EXERCISE FOR CHRONIC NECK PAIN. OBJECTIVES: CHRONIC NECK PAIN IS A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM WITH ONLY VERY FEW EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT OPTIONS. THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE FOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR RELIEVING MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF IYENGAR YOGA COMPARED WITH EXERCISE ON CHRONIC NONSPECIFIC NECK PAIN. METHODS: PATIENTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER YOGA OR EXERCISE. THE YOGA GROUP ATTENDED A 9-WEEK YOGA COURSE AND THE EXERCISE GROUP RECEIVED A SELF-CARE MANUAL ON HOME-BASED EXERCISES FOR NECK PAIN RELIEF. THE MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE WAS THE PRESENT NECK PAIN INTENSITY (100 MM VISUAL ANALOG SCALE). SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY (NECK DISABILITY INDEX), PAIN AT MOTION (VISUAL ANALOG SCALE), HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (SHORT FORM-36 QUESTIONNAIRE), CERVICAL RANGE OF MOTION, PROPRIOCEPTIVE ACUITY, AND PRESSURE PAIN THRESHOLD. RESULTS: FIFTY-ONE PATIENTS (MEAN AGE 47.8 Y ; 82.4% FEMALE) WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA (N=25) AND EXERCISE (N=26) INTERVENTION. AFTER THE STUDY PERIOD, PATIENTS IN THE YOGA GROUP REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY LESS NECK PAIN INTENSITY COMPARED WITH THE EXERCISE GROUP [MEAN DIFFERENCE: -13.9 MM (95% CI, -26.4 TO -1.4), P=0.03]. THE YOGA GROUP REPORTED LESS DISABILITY AND BETTER MENTAL QUALITY OF LIFE. RANGE OF MOTION AND PROPRIOCEPTIVE ACUITY WERE IMPROVED AND THE PRESSURE PAIN THRESHOLD WAS ELEVATED IN THE YOGA GROUP. DISCUSSION: YOGA WAS MORE EFFECTIVE IN RELIEVING CHRONIC NONSPECIFIC NECK PAIN THAN A HOME-BASED EXERCISE PROGRAM. YOGA REDUCED NECK PAIN INTENSITY AND DISABILITY AND IMPROVED HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE. MOREOVER, YOGA SEEMS TO INFLUENCE THE FUNCTIONAL STATUS OF NECK MUSCLES, AS INDICATED BY IMPROVEMENT OF PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES OF NECK PAIN.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
16 2322  29 TREATMENT OF CHRONIC LOWER BACK PAIN: STUDY PROTOCOL OF A COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS STUDY ON YOGA, EURYTHMY THERAPY, AND PHYSIOTHERAPEUTIC EXERCISES. BACKGROUND: WE AIM TO COMPARE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF 3 ACTIVE INTERVENTIONS, I.E., YOGA, EURYTHMY THERAPY, AND PHYSIOTHERAPEUTIC EXERCISE, ON CHRONIC LOWER BACK PAIN. METHODS: IN THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OVER 16 WEEKS (8 WEEKS OF INTERVENTION, 8 WEEKS OF FOLLOW-UP), DATA OF INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC LOWER BACK PAIN WILL BE ANALYZED. INTERVENTIONS ARE IMPLEMENTED AS GROUP SESSIONS (75 MIN) ONCE PER WEEK. PARTICIPANTS RECEIVE A MANUAL FOR HOME-BASED PRACTICE AND ARE ASSESSED BEFORE AND AT THE END OF THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION PERIOD, AND AT THE END OF AN 8-WEEK FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. STANDARDIZED QUESTIONNAIRES ARE: THE ROLAND-MORRIS DISABILITY SCORE, VISUAL ANALOG SCALES MEASURING INTENSITY OF PAIN, THE BRIEF MULTIDIMENSIONAL LIFE SATISFACTION SCALE, THE PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE, THE INNER CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE PRACTICES QUESTIONNAIRE, THE FREIBURG MINDFULNESS QUESTIONNAIRE, THE GENERAL SELF-EFFICACY SCALE, A SELF-REGULATION QUESTIONNAIRE, THE INTERNAL COHERENCE SCALE, A PAIN DIARY (REGISTERING THE NEED OF ANALGESIC MEDICATION), AND A QUESTIONNAIRE ON THE PATIENTS' EXPECTATION THAT THE INTERVENTIONS WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING PAIN AND HOW STRONG THIS REDUCTION MIGHT BE (2 SINGLE ITEMS), ETC. DISCUSSION: THIS LARGE MULTICENTER STUDY WILL PROVIDE EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF 3 CONTRASTING MOVEMENT-ORIENTATED TREATMENTS THAT SHARE SOME SIMILARITIES BUT DIFFER IN ESSENTIAL DETAILS: YOGA, EURYTHMY THERAPY, AND PHYSIOTHERAPEUTIC EXERCISES. IT WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT DATA ON NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL OPTIONS TO TREAT LOWER BACK PAIN IN A LARGE GROUP OF AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
17  753  35 EFFECT OF SHORT-TERM INTENSIVE YOGA PROGRAM ON PAIN, FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY AND SPINAL FLEXIBILITY IN CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROL STUDY. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE EFFECT OF A SHORT-TERM INTENSIVE RESIDENTIAL YOGA PROGRAM WITH PHYSICAL EXERCISE (CONTROL) ON PAIN AND SPINAL FLEXIBILITY IN SUBJECTS WITH CHRONIC LOW-BACK PAIN (CLBP). DESIGN: THIS WAS A WAIT-LIST, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. SETTING: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT A RESIDENTIAL INTEGRATIVE HEALTH CENTER IN BANGALORE, SOUTH INDIA. SUBJECTS: EIGHTY (80) SUBJECTS (FEMALES, N = 37) WITH CLBP, WHO CONSENTED WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO RECEIVE YOGA OR PHYSICAL EXERCISE IF THEY SATISFIED THE SELECTION CRITERIA. INTERVENTION: THE INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF A 1-WEEK INTENSIVE RESIDENTIAL YOGA PROGRAM COMPRISED OF ASANAS (PHYSICAL POSTURES) DESIGNED FOR BACK PAIN, PRANAYAMAS (BREATHING PRACTICES), MEDITATION, AND DIDACTIC AND INTERACTIVE SESSIONS ON PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPTS OF YOGA. THE CONTROL GROUP PRACTICED PHYSICAL EXERCISES UNDER A TRAINED PHYSIATRIST AND ALSO HAD DIDACTIC AND INTERACTIVE SESSIONS ON LIFESTYLE CHANGE. BOTH OF THE GROUPS WERE MATCHED FOR TIME ON INTERVENTION AND ATTENTION. OUTCOME MEASURES: PAIN-RELATED OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED BY THE OSWESTRY DISABILITY INDEX (ODI) AND BY SPINAL FLEXIBILITY, WHICH WAS ASSESSED USING GONIOMETER AT PRE AND POST INTERVENTION. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (RMANOVA). RESULTS: DATA CONFORMED TO A GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN ODI SCORES IN THE YOGA GROUP COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP (P = 0.01; EFFECT SIZE 1.264). SPINAL FLEXIBILITY MEASURES IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY IN BOTH GROUPS BUT THE YOGA GROUP HAD GREATER IMPROVEMENT AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS ON SPINAL FLEXION (P = 0.008; EFFECT SIZE 0.146), SPINAL EXTENSION (P = 0.002; EFFECT SIZE 0.251), RIGHT LATERAL FLEXION (P = 0.059; EFFECT SIZE 0.006); AND LEFT LATERAL FLEXION (P = 0.006; EFFECT SIZE 0.171). CONCLUSIONS: SEVEN (7) DAYS OF A RESIDENTIAL INTENSIVE YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE PROGRAM REDUCED PAIN-RELATED DISABILITY AND IMPROVED SPINAL FLEXIBILITY IN PATIENTS WITH CLBP BETTER THAN A PHYSICAL EXERCISE REGIMEN.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
18  815  39 EFFECT OF YOGA ON CHRONIC NON-SPECIFIC NECK PAIN: AN UNCONDITIONAL GROWTH MODEL. OBJECTIVE: CHRONIC NECK PAIN IS A COMMON PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE POPULATION. CONVENTIONAL TREATMENTS SUCH AS MEDICATION AND EXERCISE HAVE SHOWN LIMITED ANALGESIC EFFECTS. THIS ANALYSIS IS BASED ON AN ORIGINAL STUDY THAT WAS CONDUCTED TO INVESTIGATE THE PHYSICAL AND BEHAVIORAL EFFECTS OF A 9-WEEK IYENGAR YOGA COURSE ON CHRONIC NON-SPECIFIC NECK PAIN. THIS SECONDARY ANALYSIS USES LINEAR MIXED MODELS TO INVESTIGATE THE INDIVIDUAL TRAJECTORIES OF PAIN INTENSITY IN PARTICIPANTS BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER THE IYENGAR YOGA COURSE. METHOD: PARTICIPANTS WITH CHRONIC NON-SPECIFIC NECK PAIN WERE SELECTED FOR THE STUDY. THE PARTICIPANTS SUFFERED FROM NECK PAIN FOR AT LEAST 5DAYS PER WEEK FOR AT LEAST THE PRECEDING 3 MONTHS, WITH A MEAN NECK PAIN INTENSITY (NPI) OF 40MM OR MORE ON A VISUAL ANALOG SCALE OF 100MM. THE PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER A YOGA GROUP (23) OR TO A SELF-DIRECTED EXERCISE GROUP (24). THE MEAN AGE OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP WAS 46, AND RANGED FROM 19 TO 59. THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP PARTICIPATED IN AN IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM DESIGNED TO TREAT CHRONIC NON-SPECIFIC NECK PAIN. OUR CURRENT ANALYSIS ONLY INCLUDES PARTICIPANTS WHO WERE INITIALLY RANDOMIZED INTO THE YOGA GROUP. THE AVERAGE WEEKLY NECK PAIN INTENSITY AT BASELINE, DURING AND POST INTERVENTION, COMPRISING 11 TOTAL TIME POINTS, WAS USED TO CONSTRUCT THE GROWTH MODELS. WE PERFORMED A STEP-UP LINEAR MIXED MODEL ANALYSIS TO INVESTIGATE CHANGE IN NPI DURING THE YOGA INTERVENTION. WE FIT NESTED MODELS USING RESTRICTED MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATION (REML), TESTED FIXED EFFECTS WITH WALD TEST P-VALUES AND RANDOM EFFECTS WITH THE LIKELIHOOD RATIO TEST. WE CONSTRUCTED 10 REML MODELS. RESULTS: THE MODEL THAT FIT THE DATA BEST WAS AN UNCONDITIONAL RANDOM QUADRATIC GROWTH MODEL, WITH A FIRST-ORDER AUTO-REGRESSIVE STRUCTURE SPECIFIED FOR THE RESIDUAL R MATRIX. PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT VARIATION IN NPI. THEY DEMONSTRATED VARIATION IN THEIR INTERCEPTS, IN THEIR LINEAR RATES OF CHANGE, AND MOST TELLINGLY, IN THEIR QUADRATIC RATES OF CHANGE. CONCLUSIONS: WHILE ALL PARTICIPANTS BENEFITTED FROM THE YOGA INTERVENTION, THE DEGREE TO WHICH THEY BENEFITTED VARIED. ADDITIONALLY, THEY DID NOT EXPERIENCE A CONSISTENT RATE OF REDUCTION IN NPI - THEIR NPI FLUCTUATED, EITHER INCREASING AND THEN DECREASING, OR VICE-VERSA. WE COMMENT ON THE CLINICAL AND RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS OF OUR FINDINGS.	2018	
                       
19 2845  28 YOGA, EURYTHMY THERAPY AND STANDARD PHYSIOTHERAPY (YES-TRIAL) FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC NON-SPECIFIC LOW BACK PAIN: A THREE-ARMED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. WE AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND EURYTHMY THERAPY COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL PHYSIOTHERAPY EXERCISES IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. IN A THREE-ARMED, MULTICENTRE, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN WERE TREATED FOR 8 WEEKS IN GROUP SESSIONS (75 MINUTES ONCE PER WEEK). PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS PATIENTS' PHYSICAL DISABILITY (MEASURED BY RMDQ) FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 8. SECONDARY OUTCOME VARIABLES WERE PAIN INTENSITY AND PAIN-RELATED BOTHERSOMENESS (VAS), HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (SF-12) AND LIFE SATISFACTION (BMLSS). OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE, AFTER THE INTERVENTION AT 8 WEEKS AND AT A 16-WEEK FOLLOW UP. DATA OF 274 PARTICIPANTS WERE USED FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSES. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE THREE GROUPS FOR THE PRIMARY AND ALL SECONDARY OUTCOMES. IN ALL GROUPS, RMDQ DECREASED COMPARABLY AT 8 WEEKS, BUT DID NOT REACH CLINICAL MEANINGFULNESS. PAIN INTENSITY AND PAIN-RELATED BOTHERSOMENESS DECREASED, WHILE QUALITY OF LIFE INCREASED IN ALL 3 GROUPS. IN EXPLORATIVE GENERAL LINEAR MODELS FOR THE SF-12'S MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENT PARTICIPANTS IN THE EURYTHMY ARM BENEFITTED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE COMPARED TO PHYSIOTHERAPY AND YOGA. FURTHERMORE, WITHIN-GROUP ANALYSES SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS OF SF-12 MENTAL SCORE FOR YOGA AND EURYTHMY THERAPY ONLY. ALL INTERVENTIONS WERE SAFE. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTER: DRKS-ID: DRKS00004651 PERSPECTIVE: THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A MULTICENTRE THREE-ARMED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL ON THE CLINICAL EFFECTS OF THREE 8-WEEK PROGRAMS IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. COMPARED TO THE 'GOLD STANDARD' OF CONVENTIONAL PHYSIOTHERAPEUTIC EXERCISES, EURYTHMY THERAPY AND YOGA THERAPY LEAD TO COMPARABLE SYMPTOMATIC IMPROVEMENTS IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. HOWEVER, THE WITHIN-GROUP EFFECT SIZES WERE SMALL TO MODERATE AND DID NOT REACH CLINICAL MEANINGFULNESS ON PATIENTS' PHYSICAL DISABILITY (RMDQ).	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
20  779  32 EFFECT OF YOGA AS ADD-ON THERAPY IN MIGRAINE (CONTAIN): A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AS AN ADJUVANT TO CONVENTIONAL MEDICAL MANAGEMENT ON CLINICAL OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS WITH MIGRAINE. METHODS: CONTAIN WAS A PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, OPEN-LABEL SUPERIORITY TRIAL WITH BLINDED ENDPOINT ASSESSMENT CARRIED OUT AT A SINGLE TERTIARY CARE ACADEMIC HOSPITAL IN NEW DELHI, INDIA. PATIENTS ENROLLED WERE AGED 18-50 YEARS WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF EPISODIC MIGRAINE AND WERE RANDOMIZED INTO MEDICAL AND YOGA GROUPS (1:1). RANDOMIZATION WAS COMPUTER-GENERATED WITH A VARIABLE BLOCK SIZE AND CONCEALED. A PREDESIGNED YOGA INTERVENTION WAS GIVEN FOR 3 MONTHS. OUTCOMES WERE RECORDED BY A BLINDED ASSESSOR. THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT WAS A DECREASE IN HEADACHE FREQUENCY, HEADACHE INTENSITY, AND HEADACHE IMPACT TEST (HIT)-6 SCORE. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED CHANGE IN MIGRAINE DISABILITY ASSESSMENT (MIDAS) SCORE, PILL COUNT, AND PROPORTION OF HEADACHE FREE PATIENTS. RESULTS: BETWEEN APRIL 2017 AND AUGUST 2018, 160 PATIENTS WITH EPISODIC MIGRAINE WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO MEDICAL AND YOGA GROUPS. A TOTAL OF 114 PATIENTS COMPLETED THE TRIAL. BASELINE MEASURES WERE COMPARABLE EXCEPT FOR A HIGHER MEAN HEADACHE FREQUENCY IN THE YOGA GROUP. COMPARED TO MEDICAL THERAPY, THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT MEAN DELTA VALUE REDUCTION IN HEADACHE FREQUENCY (DELTA DIFFERENCE 3.53 [95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL 2.52-4.54]; P < 0.0001), HEADACHE INTENSITY (1.31 [0.60-2.01]; P = 0.0004), HIT SCORE (8.0 [4.78-11.22]; P < 0.0001), MIDAS SCORE (7.85 [4.98-10.97]; P < 0.0001), AND PILL COUNT (2.28 [1.06-3.51]; P < 0.0003). CONCLUSION: YOGA AS AN ADD-ON THERAPY IN MIGRAINE IS SUPERIOR TO MEDICAL THERAPY ALONE. IT MAY BE USEFUL TO INTEGRATE A COST-EFFECTIVE AND SAFE INTERVENTION LIKE YOGA INTO THE MANAGEMENT OF MIGRAINE. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: CTRI/2017/03/008041. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: THIS STUDY PROVIDES CLASS III EVIDENCE THAT FOR PATIENTS WITH EPISODIC MIGRAINE, YOGA AS ADJUVANT TO MEDICAL THERAPY IMPROVES HEADACHE FREQUENCY, INTENSITY, IMPACT, AND DISABILITY.	2020

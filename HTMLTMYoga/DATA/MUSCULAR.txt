1  992 120 EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA PRACTICE ON THE HEALTH-RELATED ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL FITNESS. TEN HEALTHY, UNTRAINED VOLUNTEERS (NINE FEMALES AND ONE MALE), RANGING IN AGE FROM 18-27 YEARS, WERE STUDIED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA PRACTICE ON THE HEALTH-RELATED ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL FITNESS, INCLUDING MUSCULAR STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE, FLEXIBILITY, CARDIORESPIRATORY FITNESS, BODY COMPOSITION, AND PULMONARY FUNCTION. SUBJECTS WERE REQUIRED TO ATTEND A MINIMUM OF TWO YOGA CLASSES PER WEEK FOR A TOTAL OF 8 WEEKS. EACH YOGA SESSION CONSISTED OF 10 MINUTES OF PRANAYAMAS (BREATH-CONTROL EXERCISES), 15 MINUTES OF DYNAMIC WARM-UP EXERCISES, 50 MINUTES OF ASANAS (YOGA POSTURES), AND 10 MINUTES OF SUPINE RELAXATION IN SAVASANA (CORPSE POSE). THE SUBJECTS WERE EVALUATED BEFORE AND AFTER THE 8-WEEK TRAINING PROGRAM. ISOKINETIC MUSCULAR STRENGTH FOR ELBOW EXTENSION, ELBOW FLEXION, AND KNEE EXTENSION INCREASED BY 31%, 19%, AND 28% (P<0.05), RESPECTIVELY, WHEREAS ISOMETRIC MUSCULAR ENDURANCE FOR KNEE FLEXION INCREASED 57% (P<0.01). ANKLE FLEXIBILITY, SHOULDER ELEVATION, TRUNK EXTENSION, AND TRUNK FLEXION INCREASED BY 13% (P<0.01), 155% (P<0.001), 188% (P<0.001), AND 14% (P<0.05), RESPECTIVELY. ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE MAXIMAL OXYGEN UPTAKE INCREASED BY 7% AND 6%, RESPECTIVELY (P<0.01). THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT REGULAR HATHA YOGA PRACTICE CAN ELICIT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE HEALTH-RELATED ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL FITNESS.

2 2509  30 YOGA BREATHING TECHNIQUES HAVE NO IMPACT ON ISOKINETIC AND ISOINERTIAL POWER. WOOTEN, SV, CHERUP, N, MAZZEI, N, PATEL, S, MOONEY, K, RAFIQ, A, AND SIGNORILE, JF. YOGA BREATHING TECHNIQUES HAVE NO IMPACT ON ISOKINETIC AND ISOINERTIAL POWER. J STRENGTH COND RES 34(2): 430-439, 2020-AS AN EXERCISE DISCIPLINE, YOGA INCORPORATES BREATHING (PRANAYAMA) AND POSTURE (ASANA) TECHNIQUES TO FACILITATE IMPROVEMENTS IN FLEXIBILITY, STRENGTH, AND MEDITATION. BOTH TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN USED TO ENHANCE MUSCULAR STRENGTH AND POWER OUTPUT. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF VARIOUS YOGA BREATHING TECHNIQUES ON LOWER-LIMB POWER OUTPUT. THIRTY-TWO INDIVIDUALS (15 MEN AND 17 WOMEN) PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY. ALL SUBJECTS PERFORMED A BASELINE 1 REPETITION MAXIMUM (1RM) ON A PNEUMATIC LEG PRESS MACHINE AND ISOKINETIC TESTING ON A BIODEX 4 DYNAMOMETER. PARTICIPANTS THEN PERFORMED 3RM POWER TESTS AT 50% OF 1RM ON THE PNEUMATIC LEG PRESS MACHINE USING 3 DIFFERENT YOGA BREATHING TECHNIQUES (UJJAYI, BHASTRIKA, AND KAPALABHATI) AND NORMAL BREATHING (CONTROL) ACROSS ALL REPETITIONS. AFTER POWER TESTING, PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED AN ISOKINETIC TEST ON THE BIODEX 4 DYNAMOMETER USING THEIR DOMINANT LEG. SUBJECTS HAD THEIR KNEE PLACED AT A PREDETERMINED STARTING POSITION (90 DEGREES ) AND EXECUTED KNEE EXTENSION AT 3 RANDOMIZED TESTING SPEEDS (60, 180, AND 300 DEGREES .S). THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SPECIFIC BREATHING PROTOCOLS BEFORE AND DURING THE LEG PRESS PRODUCED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN POWER OUTPUT. FOR ISOKINETIC POWER MEASURED AT 60, 180, AND 300 DEGREES .S, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE AMONG TESTING SPEEDS (ETA = 0.639; P < 0.0001) AND A SIGNIFICANT SEX X SPEED INTERACTION (ETA = 0.064; P < 0.0001), WHERE MEN CONSISTENTLY DEMONSTRATED GREATER ISOINERTIAL POWER, ISOKINETIC POWER, ISOKINETIC TORQUE, AND ISOKINETIC WORK THAN WOMEN. NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES OR INTERACTIONS WERE DETECTED. THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUR STUDY AND OTHERS, WHICH HAVE CONCLUDED THAT ADOPTING SPECIFIC BREATHING TECHNIQUES CAN ENHANCE CORE STABILITY AND FORCE PRODUCTION DURING LIFTING, MAY BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ACUTE NATURE OF THE DESIGN, THE NOVICE PARTICIPANTS WHO HAD INSUFFICIENT TIME TO PRACTICE THE BREATHING TECHNIQUES OR TESTING PROTOCOLS, AND THE USE OF TESTS THAT ISOLATED SPECIFIC MUSCLE GROUPS. NONETHELESS, THE CURRENT FINDINGS DO NOT SUPPORT THE USE OF YOGA BREATHING TECHNIQUES AS A METHOD TO ENHANCE POWER OUTPUT, WHETHER USED BEFORE OR DURING POWER PERFORMANCE.	2020	

3 2131  34 THE EFFECTS OF A 6-MONTH MODERATE-INTENSITY HATHA YOGA-BASED TRAINING PROGRAM ON HEALTH-RELATED FITNESS IN MIDDLE-AGED SEDENTARY WOMEN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. BACKGROUND: THERE IS PAUCITY OF DATA EXAMINING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF LONG-TERM HATHA YOGA-BASED (HY) PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON THE HEALTH-RELATED FITNESS (H-RF) OF ASYMPTOMATIC, SEDENTARY WOMEN. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF A 6-MONTH HY-BASED TRAINING PROGRAM ON H-RF COMPONENTS IN SEDENTARY MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN. METHODS: EIGHTY SEDENTARY WOMEN WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED INTO EITHER THE HY GROUP (HYG) (N.=42) OR THE CONTROL GROUP (CG) (N.=38). THE 6-MONTH HYG PROGRAM INVOLVED A PROGRESSIVE SERIES OF VINYASA FLOW POSES PERFORMED 3 TIMES/WEEK FOR 60 MINUTES (40 MINUTES WITHIN THE EXERCISE ZONE OF 60-75% HR<INF>MAX</INF>). THE CG PARTICIPANTS DID NOT UNDERGO ANY PHYSICAL TRAINING OR EDUCATION. HEALTH-RELATED FITNESS PARAMETERS INCLUDED MEASURES OF PRE- AND POST-TRAINING: BODY COMPOSITION, MUSCULAR STRENGTH AND MAXIMAL VOLUNTARY ISOMETRIC TORQUES OF ELBOW FLEXORS AND KNEE EXTENSORS, CARDIO-RESPIRATORY FITNESS, LOWER BACK AND HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY AND A STATIC-DYNAMIC BALANCE. RESULTS: TWO-WAY MIXED DESIGN ANOVA REVEALED SIGNIFICANT MAIN EFFECTS FOR ALL THE INDICATORS OF H-RF. TUKEY POST-HOC TESTS CONFIRMED THAT THE HYG DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN EVERY VARIABLE TESTED. EXAMPLES OF THE BENEFITS ACHIEVED INCLUDE (ALL P<.001): AN AVERAGE LOSS OF 1.03 KG AND A 4.82% DECREASE IN BODY FAT, 14.6% AND 13.1% GAINS IN ISOMETRIC STRENGTH OF THE KNEE EXTENSORS AND ELBOW FLEXORS RESPECTIVELY, AN INCREASE IN RELATIVE VO<INF>2MAX</INF> OF 6.1% (33.12+/-5.30 TO 35.14+/-4.82 ML/KG/MIN), A 4-CM OR 10.4% INCREASE IN THEIR MSAR, AND AN AVERAGE IMPROVED BALANCE INDEX OF 5.6 MM/S. REVERSELY, THE CG SHOWED NON-SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN H-RF VARIABLES (ALL P>0.05; PERCENT RANGE FROM -1.4% TO 1.1%). CONCLUSIONS: BY PARTICIPATING IN A MODERATE-INTENSITY 6-MONTH HY-BASED TRAINING PROGRAM, MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THEIR HR-F STATUS. THE APPLICATION OF PROGRESSIVE TARGET HEART RATE GOALS FACILITATED GREATER THAN EXPECTED IMPROVEMENTS IN CARDIO-RESPIRATORY FITNESS AND IMPROVEMENTS IN BODY COMPOSITION.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
4 1095  23 EFFECTS OF YOGA PRACTICE ON MUSCULAR ENDURANCE IN YOUNG WOMEN. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO VERIFY THE EFFECTS OF A SYSTEMATIZED YOGA PRACTICE ON MUSCULAR ENDURANCE IN YOUNG WOMEN. TWENTY SIX WOMEN (24 +/- 3.5 YEARS OLD) PARTICIPATED IN SIX WEEKS OF YOGA CLASSES, AND TWENTY ONE WOMEN (25 +/- 5.1 YEARS OLD) PARTICIPATED AS THE CONTROL GROUP. THE YOGA INTERVENTION WAS COMPOSED OF EIGHTEEN SESSIONS, THREE TIMES PER WEEK, AT 1 H PER SESSION. THE MUSCULAR ENDURANCE OF UPPER LIMBS (PUSH-UP) AND ABDOMINAL (SIT-UP) WAS ASSESSED THROUGH THE PROTOCOL SUGGESTED BY GETTMAN (1989) [1] AND GOLDING, MYERS AND SINNING (1989) [2] TO THE MAXIMUM REPETITIONS PERFORMED IN 1 MIN. TO VERIFY THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES INTRA GROUPS AND BETWEEN GROUPS A SPANOVA WAS PERFORMED, AND THE LEVEL OF SIGNIFICANCE WAS P </= 0.05. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA PROVIDES IMPROVEMENT IN UPPER LIMB AND IN ABDOMINAL MUSCULAR ENDURANCE.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
5  943  26 EFFECTS OF A 12-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION ON CARDIORESPIRATORY ENDURANCE, MUSCULAR STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE, AND FLEXIBILITY IN HONG KONG CHINESE ADULTS: A CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL. OBJECTIVE. TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF A 12-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION ON CARDIORESPIRATORY ENDURANCE, MUSCULAR STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE, AND FLEXIBILITY IN CHINESE ADULTS. METHODS. 173 ADULTS (AGED 52.0 +/- 7.5 YEARS) WERE ASSIGNED TO EITHER THE YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 87) OR THE WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 86). 19 DROPPED OUT FROM THE STUDY. PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE CHANGES IN CARDIORESPIRATORY ENDURANCE (RESTING HEART RATE (HR) AND MAXIMAL OXYGEN UPTAKE (VO2MAX)), MUSCULAR STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE (CURL-UP AND PUSH-UP TESTS), AND LOWER BACK AND HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY (THE MODIFIED BACK-SAVER SIT-AND-REACH (MBS) TEST). RESULTS. COMPARED TO CONTROLS, THE YOGA GROUP ACHIEVED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN VO2MAX (P < 0.01), CURL-UP (P < 0.05) AND PUSH-UP (P < 0.001) TESTS, AND THE MBS LEFT AND RIGHT LEG TESTS (BOTH P < 0.001) IN BOTH GENDERS. SIGNIFICANT CHANGE WAS ALSO FOUND FOR RESTING HR BETWEEN GROUPS IN WOMEN (P < 0.05) BUT NOT IN MEN. FURTHER ANALYSIS COMPARING PARTICIPANTS BETWEEN YOUNGER AND OLDER SUBGROUPS YIELDED SIMILAR FINDINGS, EXCEPT THAT THE OLDER PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP FAILED TO IMPROVE RESTING HR OR THE CURL-UP TEST VERSUS CONTROL. ADHERENCE (89%) AND ATTENDANCE (94%) WERE HIGH. NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS OCCURRED. CONCLUSION. A 12-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION HAS FAVORABLE EFFECTS ON CARDIORESPIRATORY ENDURANCE, MUSCULAR STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE, AND FLEXIBILITY IN CHINESE ADULTS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
6 1397  29 IMPACT OF YOGA IN FACILITATING MUSCULAR FUNCTIONING AMONG ASYMPTOMATIC MALE CRICKET PLAYERS: LONGITUDINAL RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. BACKGROUND: CRICKET IS ONE OF THE PROMINENT GLOBAL TEAM SPORTS. WITH AN EMERGENCE OF TWENTY20 TOURNAMENTS, THE PHYSICAL PREPARATION OF ELITE CRICKET PLAYERS HAS BECOME COMPLEX WITH HIGH MATCH INJURY INCIDENCE. YOGA AS A BODY-MIND TRAINING IS ASSOCIATED WITH HAVING POSITIVE EFFECTS ON A PERSON'S PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS, BRINGING IN BETTER MIND-BODY EQUILIBRIUM. OBJECTIVES: EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF YOGA IN FACILITATING MUSCULAR FUNCTIONING AND MINDFULNESS AMONG ASYMPTOMATIC MALE CRICKET PLAYERS. METHOD: FIRST-CLASS DOMESTIC MALE CRICKET PLAYERS IN THE AGE GROUP OF 18-35 YEARS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO YOGA GROUP N=42 AND WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP N=40. PLAYERS RECEIVED THE YOGA MODULE FOR FIVE DAYS PER WEEK FOR A DURATION OF SIX WEEKS. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES OF MUSCULAR FUNCTIONING WERE CORE STABILITY, FLEXIBILITY, RANGE OF MOTION, STATIC BALANCE, DYNAMIC BALANCE AND PROPRIOCEPTION OF THE ANKLE. ASSESSMENTS WERE HELD AT BASELINE, IMMEDIATE POST-INTERVENTION, AND A FOLLOW-UP AFTER SIX MONTHS OF INTERVENTION. RESULTS: A STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE WITH P < .001 WAS OBSERVED FOR MOST OF THE VARIABLES AT T2 AND T3. COMPARISON OF THE MODEL FIT SHOWS A HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT P < 0.001 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MODEL AS COMPARED TO THE BASELINE MODEL AMONG MOST OF THE VARIABLES. CONCLUSION: THIS YOGA MODULE WAS APPROPRIATE FOR ENHANCING MUSCULAR FUNCTIONING VARIABLES OF THIS STUDY. CONTINUOUS PRACTICE OF THIS YOGA MODULE CAN REINFORCE SUSTAINABLE BENEFITS FOR MALE CRICKET PLAYERS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
7  880  25 EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON HANDGRIP, RESPIRATORY PRESSURES AND PULMONARY FUNCTION. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REPORTS ON THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS, VERY FEW STUDIES HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN ON THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON RESPIRATORY PRESSURES AND HANDGRIP ENDURANCE. HENCE THE PRESENT WORK WAS PLANNED TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON HAND GRIP STRENGTH (HGS), HAND GRIP ENDURANCE (HGE), MAXIMUM EXPIRATORY PRESSURE (MEP), MAXIMUM INSPIRATORY PRESSURE (MIP), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME (FEV), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN FIRST SECOND (FEV1) AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR). 20 SCHOOL CHILDREN IN THE AGE GROUP OF 12 TO 15 YEARS WERE GIVEN YOGA TRAINING (ASANS AND PRANAYAMS) FOR 6 MONTHS. 20 AGE AND GENDER-MATCHED STUDENTS FORMED THE CONTROL GROUP. YOGA TRAINING PRODUCED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.05) INCREASE IN HGS AND HGE. MEP, MIP, FEV, FEV1 AND PEFR ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (P < 0.001) AFTER THE YOGA TRAINING. IN CONTRAST, THE INCREASE IN THESE PARAMETERS IN THE CONTROL GROUP WAS STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT. OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT YOGA TRAINING FOR 6 MONTHS IMPROVES LUNG FUNCTION, STRENGTH OF INSPIRATORY AND EXPIRATORY MUSCLES AS WELL AS SKELETAL MUSCLE STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT YOGA BE INTRODUCED AT SCHOOL LEVEL IN ORDER TO IMPROVE PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS, OVERALL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE OF STUDENTS.	2003	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
8  438  21 CARDIOVASCULAR AND RESPIRATORY EFFECT OF YOGIC SLOW BREATHING IN THE YOGA BEGINNER: WHAT IS THE BEST APPROACH? SLOW BREATHING INCREASES CARDIAC-VAGAL BAROREFLEX SENSITIVITY (BRS), IMPROVES OXYGEN SATURATION, LOWERS BLOOD PRESSURE, AND REDUCES ANXIETY. WITHIN THE YOGA TRADITION SLOW BREATHING IS OFTEN PAIRED WITH A CONTRACTION OF THE GLOTTIS MUSCLES. THIS RESISTANCE BREATH "UJJAYI" IS PERFORMED AT VARIOUS RATES AND RATIOS OF INSPIRATION/EXPIRATION. TO TEST WHETHER UJJAYI HAD ADDITIONAL POSITIVE EFFECTS TO SLOW BREATHING, WE COMPARED BRS AND VENTILATORY CONTROL UNDER DIFFERENT BREATHING PATTERNS (EQUAL/UNEQUAL INSPIRATION/EXPIRATION AT 6 BREATH/MIN, WITH/WITHOUT UJJAYI), IN 17 YOGA-NAIVE YOUNG HEALTHY PARTICIPANTS. BRS INCREASED WITH SLOW BREATHING TECHNIQUES WITH OR WITHOUT EXPIRATORY UJJAYI (P < 0.05 OR HIGHER) EXCEPT WITH INSPIRATORY + EXPIRATORY UJJAYI. THE MAXIMAL INCREASE IN BRS AND DECREASE IN BLOOD PRESSURE WERE FOUND IN SLOW BREATHING WITH EQUAL INSPIRATION AND EXPIRATION. THIS CORRESPONDED WITH A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN OXYGEN SATURATION WITHOUT INCREASE IN HEART RATE AND VENTILATION. UJJAYI SHOWED SIMILAR INCREASE IN OXYGEN SATURATION BUT SLIGHTLY LESSER IMPROVEMENT IN BAROREFLEX SENSITIVITY WITH NO CHANGE IN BLOOD PRESSURE. THE SLOW BREATHING WITH EQUAL INSPIRATION AND EXPIRATION SEEMS THE BEST TECHNIQUE FOR IMPROVING BAROREFLEX SENSITIVITY IN YOGA-NAIVE SUBJECTS. THE EFFECTS OF UJJAYI SEEMS DEPENDENT ON INCREASED INTRATHORACIC PRESSURE THAT REQUIRES GREATER EFFORT THAN NORMAL SLOW BREATHING.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
9  404  37 BIKRAM YOGA TRAINING AND PHYSICAL FITNESS IN HEALTHY YOUNG ADULTS. THERE HAS BEEN RELATIVELY LITTLE LONGITUDINAL CONTROLLED INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON GENERAL PHYSICAL FITNESS, DESPITE THE WIDESPREAD PARTICIPATION IN THIS FORM OF EXERCISE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS EXPLORATORY STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF SHORT-TERM BIKRAM YOGA TRAINING ON GENERAL PHYSICAL FITNESS. YOUNG HEALTHY ADULTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA TRAINING (N = 10, 29 +/- 6 YEARS, 24 SESSIONS IN 8 WEEKS) OR A CONTROL GROUP (N = 11, 26 +/- 7 YEARS). EACH YOGA TRAINING SESSION CONSISTED OF 90-MINUTE STANDARDIZED SUPERVISED POSTURES PERFORMED IN A HEATED AND HUMIDIFIED STUDIO. ISOMETRIC DEADLIFT STRENGTH, HANDGRIP STRENGTH, LOWER BACK/HAMSTRING AND SHOULDER FLEXIBILITY, RESTING HEART RATE AND BLOOD PRESSURE, MAXIMAL OXYGEN CONSUMPTION (TREADMILL), AND LEAN AND FAT MASS (DUAL-ENERGY X-RAY ABSORPTIOMETRY) WERE MEASURED BEFORE AND AFTER TRAINING. YOGA SUBJECTS EXHIBITED INCREASED DEADLIFT STRENGTH, SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED LOWER BACK/HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY, INCREASED SHOULDER FLEXIBILITY, AND MODESTLY DECREASED BODY FAT COMPARED WITH CONTROL GROUP. THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN HANDGRIP STRENGTH, CARDIOVASCULAR MEASURES, OR MAXIMAL AEROBIC FITNESS. IN SUMMARY, THIS SHORT-TERM YOGA TRAINING PROTOCOL PRODUCED BENEFICIAL CHANGES IN MUSCULOSKELETAL FITNESS THAT WERE SPECIFIC TO THE TRAINING STIMULUS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
10 2917  43 [THE EFFECT OF YOGA EXERCISE INTERVENTION ON HEALTH RELATED PHYSICAL FITNESS IN SCHOOL-AGE ASTHMATIC CHILDREN]. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA EXERCISE ON THE HEALTH-RELATED PHYSICAL FITNESS OF SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN WITH ASTHMA. THE STUDY EMPLOYED A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH DESIGN IN WHICH 31 VOLUNTARY CHILDREN (EXERCISE GROUP 16; CONTROL GROUP15) AGED 7 TO 12 YEARS WERE PURPOSIVELY SAMPLED FROM ONE PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN TAIPEI COUNTY. THE YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM WAS PRACTICED BY THE EXERCISE GROUP THREE TIMES PER WEEK FOR A CONSECUTIVE 7 WEEK PERIOD. EACH 60-MINUTE YOGA SESSION INCLUDED 10 MINUTES OF WARM-UP AND BREATHING EXERCISES, 40 MINUTES OF YOGA POSTURES, AND 10 MINUTES OF COOL DOWN EXERCISES. FITNESS SCORES WERE ASSESSED AT PRE-EXERCISE (BASELINE) AND AT THE SEVENTH AND NINTH WEEK AFTER INTERVENTION COMPLETION. A TOTAL OF 30 SUBJECTS (EXERCISE GROUP 16; CONTROL GROUP 14) COMPLETED FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS INCLUDED: 1. COMPARED WITH CHILDREN IN THE GENERAL POPULATION, THE STUDY SUBJECTS (N = 30) ALL FELL BELOW THE 50TH PERCENTILE IN ALL FIVE PHYSICAL FITNESS ITEMS OF INTEREST. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN SCORES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS AT BASELINE (I.E., PRE-EXERCISE) FOR ALL FIVE FITNESS ITEMS. 2. RESEARCH FOUND A POSITIVE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN EXERCISE HABIT AFTER SCHOOL AND MUSCULAR STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE AMONG ASTHMATIC CHILDREN. 3. COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP, THE EXERCISE GROUP SHOWED FAVORABLE OUTCOMES IN TERMS OF FLEXIBILITY AND MUSCULAR ENDURANCE. SUCH FAVORABLE OUTCOMES REMAINED EVIDENT EVEN AFTER ADJUSTING FOR AGE, DURATION OF DISEASE AND STEROID USE, VALUES FOR WHICH WERE UNEQUALLY DISTRIBUTED BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS AT BASELINE. 4. THERE WAS A TENDENCY FOR ALL ITEM-SPECIFIC FITNESS SCORES TO INCREASE OVER TIME IN THE EXERCISE GROUP. THE GEE ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT YOGA EXERCISE INDEED IMPROVED BMI, FLEXIBILITY, AND MUSCULAR ENDURANCE. AFTER 2 WEEKS OF SELF-PRACTICE AT HOME, YOGA EXERCISE CONTINUED TO IMPROVE BMI, FLEXIBILITY, MUSCULAR STRENGTH, AND CARDIOPULMONARY FITNESS.	2009

12 2750  28 YOGA PRACTICE INCREASES MINIMUM MUSCULAR FITNESS IN CHILDREN WITH VISUAL IMPAIRMENT. INTRODUCTION: MUSCLE STRENGTH, A COMPONENT FOR BALANCE, GAIT AND FUNCTIONAL MOBILITY IS VITAL FOR CHILDREN WITH VISUAL IMPAIRMENT. YOGA HAS FREQUENTLY BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL FITNESS IN CHILDREN. THIS STUDY AIMED TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF 16 WEEKS YOGA TRAINING ON MUSCULAR FI TNESS IN CHILDREN WITH VISUAL IMPAIRMENT. METHODS: THIS WAS A WAIT-LISTED TWO-ARMED-MATCHED CASE-CONTROL STUDY. EIGHTY (41 YOGA, 39 CONTROL) VISUAL IMPAIRMENT STUDENTS OF BOTH GENDERS AGED 9-16 YEARS MATCHED ON AGE, GENDER AND DEGREE OF BLINDNESS WERE ASSESSED AT PRE, MID (AFTER 8 WEEKS) AND POST (AFTER 16 WEEKS) YOGA INTERVENTION USING THE KRAUS-WEBER TEST. RESULTS: THE PERCENTAGE OF STUDENTS PASSED IN YOGA GROUP WERE 12.2%, 43.9% AND 68.3% WHEREAS PERCENTAGES IN THE CONTROL GROUP WERE 23.1%, 30.8% AND 30.8% IN PRE, MID, AND POST TESTS RESPECTIVELY. MCNEMAR TEST SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRE AND MID, MID AND POST IN THE YOGA GROUP WHILE THOSE PARAMETERS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT IN THE CONTROL GROUP. YOGA THERAPY SEEMED TO HAVE CONSIDERABLE BENEFITS FOR THE CHILDREN'S MUSCULAR FI TNESS.

TO DETERMINE THE METABOLIC AND HEART RATE (HR) RESPONSES OF HATHA YOGA, 26 WOMEN (19-40 YEARS OLD) PERFORMED A 30-MINUTE HATHA YOGA ROUTINE OF SUPINE LYING, SITTING, AND STANDING ASANAS (I.E., POSTURES). SUBJECTS FOLLOWED IDENTICAL VIDEOTAPED SEQUENCES OF HATHA YOGA ASANAS. MEAN PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES WERE COMPARED TO THE PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES OF RESTING IN A CHAIR AND WALKING ON A TREADMILL AT 93.86 M.MIN(-1) [3.5 MILES PER HOUR (MPH)]. DURING THE 30-MINUTE HATHA YOGA ROUTINE, MEAN ABSOLUTE OXYGEN CONSUMPTION (VO(2)), RELATIVE VO(2), PERCENTAGE MAXIMAL OXYGEN CONSUMPTION (%VO(2)R), METABOLIC EQUIVALENTS (METS), ENERGY EXPENDITURE, HR, AND PERCENTAGE MAXIMAL HEART RATE (%MHR) WERE 0.45 L.MIN(-1), 7.59 ML.KG(-1).MIN(-1), 14.50%, 2.17 METS, 2.23 KCAL.MIN(-1), 105.29 B.MIN(-1), AND 56.89%, RESPECTIVELY. WHEN COMPARED TO RESTING IN A CHAIR, HATHA YOGA REQUIRED 114% GREATER O(2) (L.MIN(-1)), 111% GREATER O(2)(ML.KG(-1).MIN(-1)), 4,294% GREATER %VO(2)R, 111% GREATER METS, 108% GREATER KCAL.MIN(-1), 24% GREATER HR, AND 24% GREATER %MHR. WHEN COMPARED TO WALKING AT 93.86 M.MIN(-1), HATHA YOGA REQUIRED 54% LOWER O(2)(L.MIN(-1)), 53% LOWER O(2)(ML.KG(-1).MIN(-1)), 68% LOWER %VO(2)R, 53% LOWER METS, 53% LOWER KCAL.MIN(-1), 21% LOWER HR, AND 21% LOWER %MHR. THE HATHA YOGA ROUTINE IN THIS STUDY REQUIRED 14.50% VO(2)R, WHICH CAN BE CONSIDERED A VERY LIGHT INTENSITY AND SIGNIFICANTLY LIGHTER THAN 44.8% VO(2)R FOR WALKING AT 93.86 M.MIN(-1) (3.5 MPH). THE INTENSITY OF HATHA YOGA MAY BE TOO LOW TO PROVIDE A TRAINING STIMULUS FOR IMPROVING CARDIOVASCULAR FITNESS. ALTHOUGH PREVIOUS RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT HATHA YOGA IS AN ACCEPTABLE FORM OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOR ENHANCING MUSCULAR FITNESS AND FLEXIBILITY, THESE DATA DEMONSTRATE THAT HATHA YOGA MAY HAVE LITTLE, IF ANY, CARDIOVASCULAR BENEFIT.	2005	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
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	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
15 1026  25 EFFECTS OF YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES ON PULMONARY FUNCTION IN PATIENTS WITH DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY: AN EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVE: DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY (DMD) IS THE MOST COMMON FORM OF MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY IN CHILDREN, AND CHILDREN WITH DMD DIE PREMATURELY BECAUSE OF RESPIRATORY FAILURE. WE SOUGHT TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES, AS WELL AS THE EFFECTS OF THOSE EXERCISES ON RESPIRATORY FUNCTION, IN SUCH CHILDREN. METHODS: THIS WAS A PROSPECTIVE OPEN-LABEL STUDY OF PATIENTS WITH A CONFIRMED DIAGNOSIS OF DMD, RECRUITED FROM AMONG THOSE FOLLOWED AT THE NEUROLOGY OUTPATIENT CLINIC OF A UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL IN THE CITY OF SAO PAULO, BRAZIL. PARTICIPANTS WERE TAUGHT HOW TO PERFORM HATHA YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES AND WERE INSTRUCTED TO PERFORM THE EXERCISES THREE TIMES A DAY FOR 10 MONTHS. RESULTS: OF THE 76 PATIENTS WHO ENTERED THE STUDY, 35 DROPPED OUT AND 15 WERE UNABLE TO PERFORM THE BREATHING EXERCISES, 26 HAVING THEREFORE COMPLETED THE STUDY (MEAN AGE, 9.5 +/- 2.3 YEARS; BODY MASS INDEX, 18.2 +/- 3.8 KG/M(2)). THE YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN FVC (% OF PREDICTED: 82.3 +/- 18.6% AT BASELINE VS. 90.3 +/- 22.5% AT 10 MONTHS LATER; P = 0.02) AND FEV1 (% OF PREDICTED: 83.8 +/- 16.6% AT BASELINE VS. 90.1 +/- 17.4% AT 10 MONTHS LATER; P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES CAN IMPROVE PULMONARY FUNCTION IN PATIENTS WITH DMD.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
16 2758  25 YOGA PRACTICES AS AN ALTERNATIVE TRAINING FOR PHYSICAL FITNESS IN CHILDREN WITH VISUAL IMPAIRMENT. PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES PROVIDE FUNDAMENTAL BENEFITS TO CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. THEY ARE VITAL FOR DEVELOPMENT AND HEALTHY LIFE, BUT PARTICIPATION OF CHILDREN WITH VISUAL IMPAIRMENT IS LIMITED. HEREIN, THE AUTHORS REPORT RESULTS OF A 16-WK YOGA PROGRAM, EVALUATING ITS EFFECTS ON PHYSICAL FITNESS IN CHILDREN WITH VISUAL IMPAIRMENT. EIGHTY-THREE CHILDREN AGE 9-16 YEARS (12.37 +/- 2.19) PARTICIPATED IN A 2-ARM, SINGLE-BLIND WAIT-LIST-CONTROLLED STUDY AT A RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL IN SOUTH INDIA. PARTICIPANTS (YOGA GROUP 41, CONTROLS 42) WERE ASSESSED ON MUSCLE STRENGTH, FLEXIBILITY, ENDURANCE, COORDINATION, AND RESPIRATORY HEALTH. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN PHYSICAL FITNESS WERE OBSERVED AFTER THE YOGA INTERVENTION (GROUP X TIME INTERACTIONS FOR RIGHT-HAND GRIP STRENGTH, P < .001; SIT-UP, P < .001; SIT AND REACH, P < .001; BILATERAL PLATE TAPPING, P < .001; AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE, P < .001). LEFT-HAND GRIP STRENGTH SHOWED MAIN EFFECTS OF TIME, ALTHOUGH THERE WERE NO GROUP X TIME INTERACTIONS. RESULTS DEMONSTRATE YOGA'S ABILITY TO IMPROVE A WIDE RANGE OF PHYSICAL VARIABLES IN CHILDREN WITH VISUAL IMPAIRMENT.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
17  741  18 EFFECT OF REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE ON RESPIRATORY REGULATION AND EXERCISE PERFORMANCE. YOGA ALTERS SPONTANEOUS RESPIRATORY REGULATION AND REDUCES HYPOXIC AND HYPERCAPNIC VENTILATORY RESPONSES. SINCE A LOWER VENTILATORY RESPONSE IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN IMPROVED ENDURANCE CAPACITY DURING WHOLE-BODY EXERCISE, WE TESTED WHETHER YOGIC SUBJECTS (YOGA) SHOW AN INCREASED ENDURANCE CAPACITY COMPARED TO MATCHED NON-YOGIC INDIVIDUALS (CON) WITH SIMILAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY LEVELS. RESTING VENTILATION, THE VENTILATORY RESPONSE TO HYPERCAPNIA, PASSIVE LEG MOVEMENT AND EXERCISE, AS WELL AS ENDURANCE PERFORMANCE WERE ASSESSED. YOGA (N = 9), COMPARED TO CONTROL (N = 6), HAD A HIGHER TIDAL VOLUME AT REST (0.7+/-0.2 VS. 0.5+/-0.1 L, P = 0.034) AND A REDUCED VENTILATORY RESPONSE TO HYPERCAPNIA (33+/-15 VS. 47+/-15 L.MIN(-1), P = 0.048). A YOGA SUBGROUP (N = 6) WITH MAXIMAL PERFORMANCE SIMILAR TO CONTROL SHOWED A BLUNTED VENTILATORY RESPONSE TO PASSIVE CYCLING (11+/-2 VS. 14+/-2 L.MIN(-1), P = 0.039) AND A TENDENCY TOWARDS LOWER EXERCISE VENTILATION (33+/-2 VS. 36+/-3 L.MIN(-1), P = 0.094) WHILE CYCLING ENDURANCE (YOGA: 17.3+/-3.3; CON: 19.6+/-8.5 MIN, P = 0.276) DID NOT DIFFER. THUS, YOGA PRACTICE WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED EXERCISE CAPACITY NOR WITH SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN EXERCISE VENTILATION DESPITE A SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT RESPIRATORY REGULATION AT REST AND IN RESPONSE TO HYPERCAPNIA AND PASSIVE LEG MOVEMENT.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
18  777  28 EFFECT OF YOGA AND PHYSIOTHERAPY ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN CHILDREN WITH DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY - A COMPARATIVE STUDY. CONTEXT: ABNORMAL RESPIRATORY FUNCTION IS KNOWN TO BE DETECTABLE ALMOST AS SOON AS IT CAN BE MEASURED RELIABLY. STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED THE EFFECT OF RESPIRATORY MUSCLE TRAINING AS WELL AS BREATHING EXERCISES IN IMPROVING PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN CHILDREN WITH DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY (DMD). AIMS: THIS STUDY AIMS TO IDENTIFY THE ADD-ON EFFECT OF YOGA OVER PHYSIOTHERAPY ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN CHILDREN WITH DMD. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FOUR PATIENTS WITH DMD WERE RANDOMIZED TO TWO GROUPS. GROUP I RECEIVED HOME-BASED PHYSIOTHERAPY AND GROUP II RECEIVED PHYSIOTHERAPY ALONG WITH YOGA INTERVENTION. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PULMONARY FUNCTION TEST (PFT) WAS ASSESSED BEFORE THE INTERVENTION (BASELINE DATA) AND AT REGULAR INTERVALS OF 3 MONTHS FOR A PERIOD OF 1 YEAR. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: NORMALITY WAS ASSESSED USING SHAPIRO-WILK NORMALITY TEST. THE BASELINE DATA WERE ANALYZED USING MANN-WHITNEY U-TEST TO IDENTIFY THE HOMOGENEITY. REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE WAS USED TO ASSESS SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN STUDY PARAMETERS DURING THE ASSESSMENT OF EVERY 3 MONTHS, BOTH WITHIN AND BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS OF PATIENTS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 88 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED ALL THE 5 ASSESSMENTS, WITH A MEAN AGE OF 7.9 +/- 1.5 YEARS. PFT PARAMETERS SUCH AS FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE, MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION (MVV), AND TIDAL VOLUME DURING MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION (MVT) DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN GROUP I. IN GROUP II, FVC AND MVT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED FROM BASELINE UP TO 1 YEAR, WHEREAS MVV IMPROVED FROM BASELINE UP TO 9 MONTHS. TIDAL VOLUME DID NOT SHOW ANY CHANGES IN BOTH THE GROUPS. CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT INTRODUCTION OF YOGA WITH PHYSIOTHERAPY INTERVENTION AT AN EARLY AGE CAN BE CONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES IN IMPROVING PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH DMD.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
19  642  32 DOES PRACTICING HATHA YOGA SATISFY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INTENSITY OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WHICH IMPROVES AND MAINTAINS HEALTH AND CARDIOVASCULAR FITNESS? BACKGROUND: LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE METABOLIC AND HEART RATE RESPONSES TO A TYPICAL HATHA YOGA SESSION. THE PURPOSES OF THIS STUDY WERE 1) TO DETERMINE WHETHER A TYPICAL YOGA PRACTICE USING VARIOUS POSTURES MEETS THE CURRENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR LEVELS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY REQUIRED TO IMPROVE AND MAINTAIN HEALTH AND CARDIOVASCULAR FITNESS; 2) TO DETERMINE THE RELIABILITY OF METABOLIC COSTS OF YOGA ACROSS SESSIONS; 3) TO COMPARE THE METABOLIC COSTS OF YOGA PRACTICE TO THOSE OF TREADMILL WALKING. METHODS: IN THIS OBSERVATIONAL STUDY, 20 INTERMEDIATE-TO-ADVANCED LEVEL YOGA PRACTITIONERS, AGE 31.4 +/- 8.3 YEARS, PERFORMED AN EXERCISE ROUTINE INSIDE A HUMAN RESPIRATORY CHAMBER (INDIRECT CALORIMETER) WHILE WEARING HEART RATE MONITORS. THE EXERCISE ROUTINE CONSISTED OF 30 MINUTES OF SITTING, 56 MINUTES OF BEGINNER-LEVEL HATHA YOGA ADMINISTERED BY VIDEO, AND 10 MINUTES OF TREADMILL WALKING AT 3.2 AND 4.8 KPH EACH. MEASURES WERE MEAN OXYGEN CONSUMPTION (VO2), HEART RATE (HR), PERCENTAGE PREDICTED MAXIMAL HEART RATE (%MHR), METABOLIC EQUIVALENTS (METS), AND ENERGY EXPENDITURE (KCAL). SEVEN SUBJECTS REPEATED THE PROTOCOL SO THAT MEASUREMENT RELIABILITY COULD BE ESTABLISHED. RESULTS: MEAN VALUES ACROSS THE ENTIRE YOGA SESSION FOR VO2, HR, %MHR, METS, AND ENERGY/MIN WERE 0.6 L/KG/MIN; 93.2 BEATS/MIN; 49.4%; 2.5; AND 3.2 KCAL/MIN; RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS OF THE ICCS (2,1) FOR MEAN VALUES ACROSS THE ENTIRE YOGA SESSION FOR KCAL, METS, AND %MHR WERE 0.979 AND 0.973, AND 0.865, RESPECTIVELY. CONCLUSION: METABOLIC COSTS OF YOGA AVERAGED ACROSS THE ENTIRE SESSION REPRESENT LOW LEVELS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, ARE SIMILAR TO WALKING ON A TREADMILL AT 3.2 KPH, AND DO NOT MEET RECOMMENDATIONS FOR LEVELS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOR IMPROVING OR MAINTAINING HEALTH OR CARDIOVASCULAR FITNESS. YOGA PRACTICE INCORPORATING SUN SALUTATION POSTURES EXCEEDING THE MINIMUM BOUT OF 10 MINUTES MAY CONTRIBUTE SOME PORTION OF SUFFICIENTLY INTENSE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO IMPROVE CARDIO-RESPIRATORY FITNESS IN UNFIT OR SEDENTARY INDIVIDUALS. THE MEASUREMENT OF ENERGY EXPENDITURE ACROSS YOGA SESSIONS IS HIGHLY RELIABLE.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
20 1147  34 ENERGY EXPENDITURE DURING A VINYASA YOGA SESSION. BACKGROUND: VINYASA YOGA HAS BEEN RECENTLY PROMOTED AS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR MINDFUL EXERCISES TO IMPROVE OVERALL HEALTH, INCLUDING BODY WEIGHT MANAGEMENT. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE METABOLIC RESPONSE OF 24 MODERATELY TRAINED INDIVIDUALS DURING A 90-MIN GROUP VINYASA YOGA ROUTINE. METHODS: HEART RATE (HR) TIME COURSE OF 12 MALES AND 12 FEMALES (AGE: 39+/-7.33 YEARS) WAS RECORDED DURING TWO GROUP VINYASA YOGA SESSIONS CONSISTED OF FOUR SECTIONS (WARM-UP, HIGH-INTENSITY SURYA NAMASKAR (HSN), NO SURYA NAMASKAR POSTURES, AND COOL-DOWN). MAXIMAL OXYGEN UPTAKE (VO<INF>2PEAK</INF>) AND MAXIMUM HR HAD BEEN ESTIMATED EARLIER AFTER A MAXIMAL TREADMILL TEST. VO<INF>2</INF> DURING VINYASA YOGA SESSIONS WAS ESTIMATED FROM INDIVIDUAL REGRESSION EQUATIONS USING THE RELATIONSHIP OF VO<INF>2</INF> AND HR VALUES DERIVED FROM VO<INF>2PEAK</INF> TEST, WHILE THE METABOLIC RATE (KCAL/MIN) WAS CALCULATED FROM THE RELATIONSHIP OF HR AND KCAL/MIN. TOTAL SESSION ENERGY CONSUMPTION WAS THE AVERAGE VALUE OF THE TWO YOGA SESSIONS. RESULTS: THE 2 (GENDER) X 4 (SECTIONS) MIXED ANOVA REVEALED NO SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION BETWEEN THE TWO FACTORS (P=0.101) FOR THE MEAN METABOLIC RATE (7.1+/-2.6 KCAL/MIN). MEAN METABOLIC RATE THOUGHT WAS HIGHER (P=0.015) IN MALES COMPARED TO FEMALES AT EACH SECTION. ALSO, SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND AMONG THE FOUR VINYASA YOGA SECTIONS (P<0.001) IN THE RATE OF ENERGY EXPENDITURE, WITH HSN PRESENTING THE HIGHEST MEAN VALUES (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: IT SEEMS THAT SYSTEMATIC PARTICIPATION IN VINYASA YOGA MAY EFFECTIVELY IMPROVE CARDIORESPIRATORY FITNESS AND PROMOTE BODY WEIGHT LOSS, AS AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD TO TRADITIONAL AEROBIC EXERCISE.	2020

1 2571 341 YOGA FOR EPILEPSY. BACKGROUND: THIS IS AN UPDATED VERSION OF THE ORIGINAL COCHRANE REVIEW PUBLISHED IN THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, ISSUE 1, 2002.YOGA MAY INDUCE RELAXATION AND STRESS REDUCTION, AND INFLUENCE THE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM AND THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM, THEREBY CONTROLLING SEIZURES. YOGA WOULD BE AN ATTRACTIVE THERAPEUTIC OPTION FOR EPILEPSY IF PROVED EFFECTIVE. OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS WHETHER PEOPLE WITH EPILEPSY TREATED WITH YOGA:(A) HAVE A GREATER PROBABILITY OF BECOMING SEIZURE FREE;(B) HAVE A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE FREQUENCY OR DURATION OF SEIZURES, OR BOTH; AND(C) HAVE A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE. SEARCH METHODS: WE SEARCHED THE COCHRANE EPILEPSY GROUP SPECIALIZED REGISTER (26 MARCH 2015), THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, 26 MARCH 2015), MEDLINE (OVID, 1946 TO 26 MARCH 2015), SCOPUS (1823 TO 9 JANUARY 2014), CLINICALTRIALS.GOV (26 MARCH 2015), THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO) INTERNATIONAL CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRY PLATFORM ICTRP (26 MARCH 2015), AND ALSO REGISTRIES OF THE YOGA BIOMEDICAL TRUST AND THE RESEARCH COUNCIL FOR COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE. IN ADDITION, WE SEARCHED THE REFERENCES OF ALL THE IDENTIFIED STUDIES. NO LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS WERE IMPOSED. SELECTION CRITERIA: THE FOLLOWING STUDY DESIGNS WERE ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION: RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCT) OF TREATMENT OF EPILEPSY WITH YOGA. ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS WERE ADULTS WITH UNCONTROLLED EPILEPSY COMPARING YOGA WITH NO TREATMENT OR DIFFERENT BEHAVIOURAL TREATMENTS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: THREE REVIEW AUTHORS INDEPENDENTLY SELECTED TRIALS FOR INCLUSION AND EXTRACTED DATA. THE FOLLOWING OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED: (A) PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE RENDERED SEIZURE FREE; (B) SEIZURE FREQUENCY AND DURATION; (C) QUALITY OF LIFE. ANALYSES WERE ON AN INTENTION-TO-TREAT BASIS. ODDS RATIO (OR) WITH 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (95% CL) WERE ESTIMATED FOR THE OUTCOMES. MAIN RESULTS: TWO UNBLINDED TRIALS RECRUITED A TOTAL OF 50 PEOPLE (18 TREATED WITH YOGA AND 32 TO CONTROL INTERVENTIONS). ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS WERE CONTINUED IN ALL THE PARTICIPANTS. BASELINE PHASE LASTED 3 MONTHS IN BOTH STUDIES AND TREATMENT PHASE FROM 5 WEEKS TO 6 MONTHS IN THE TWO TRIALS. RANDOMISATION WAS BY ROLL OF A DIE IN ONE STUDY AND USING A COMPUTERISED RANDOMISATION TABLE IN THE OTHER ONE BUT NEITHER STUDY PROVIDED DETAILS OF CONCEALMENT OF ALLOCATION AND WERE RATED AS UNCLEAR RISK OF BIAS. OVERALL, THE TWO STUDIES WERE RATED AS LOW RISK OF BIAS (ALL PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS; ALL EXPECTED AND PRE-EXPECTED OUTCOMES WERE REPORTED; NO OTHER SOURCES OF BIAS). THE OVERALL OR WITH 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) WAS: (I) SEIZURE FREE FOR SIX MONTHS - FOR YOGA VERSUS SHAM YOGA ORS OF 14.54 (95% CI 0.67 TO 316.69) AND FOR YOGA VERSUS NO TREATMENT GROUP 17.31 (95% CI 0.80 TO 373.45); FOR ACCEPTANCE AND COMMITMENT THERAPY (ACT) VERSUS YOGA ORS OF 1.00 (95% CL 0.16 TO 6.42; (II) REDUCTION IN SEIZURE FREQUENCY - THE MEAN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOGA VERSUS SHAM YOGA GROUP WAS -2.10 (95% CI -3.15 TO -1.05) AND FOR YOGA VERSUS NO TREATMENT GROUP -1.10 (95% CI -1.80 TO -0.40); (III) MORE THAN 50% REDUCTION IN SEIZURE FREQUENCY - FOR YOGA VERSUS SHAM YOGA GROUP ORS OF 81.00 (95% CI 4.36 TO 1504.46) AND FOR THE YOGA VERSUS NO TREATMENT GROUP 158.33 (95% CI 5.78 TO 4335.63); ACT VERSUS YOGA ORS OF 0.78 (95% CL 0.04 TO 14.75); (IV) MORE THAN 50% REDUCTION IN SEIZURE DURATION - FOR YOGA VERSUS SHAM YOGA GROUP ORS OF 45.00 (95% CI 2.01 TO 1006.75) AND FOR YOGA VERSUS NO TREATMENT GROUP 53.57 (95% CI 2.42 TO 1187.26); ACT VERSUS YOGA ORS OF 0.67 (95% CL 0.10 TO 4.35). IN ADDITION IN PANJWANI 1996 THE AUTHORS REPORTED THAT THE ONE-WAY ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE REVEALED NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE THREE GROUPS. A P-LAMBDA TEST TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE P VALUES BETWEEN THE THREE GROUPS ALSO INDICATED THAT THE DURATION OF EPILEPSY IN THE THREE GROUPS WAS NOT COMPARABLE. NO DATA WERE AVAILABLE REGARDING QUALITY OF LIFE. IN LUNDGREN 2008 THE AUTHORS REPORTED THAT THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE YOGA AND ACT GROUPS IN SEIZURE FREE RATES, 50% OR GREATER REDUCTION IN SEIZURE FREQUENCY OR SEIZURE DURATION AT ONE YEAR FOLLOW-UP. THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE ACCORDING TO THE SATISFACTION WITH LIFE SCALE (SWLS) (P < 0.05), WHILE THE ACT GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION QUALITY OF LIFE-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) SCALE (P < 0.01). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: STUDY OF 50 SUBJECTS WITH EPILEPSY FROM TWO TRIALS REVEALS POSSIBLE BENEFICIAL EFFECT IN CONTROL OF SEIZURES. RESULTS OF THE OVERALL EFFICACY ANALYSIS SHOW THAT YOGA TREATMENT WAS BETTER WHEN COMPARED WITH NO INTERVENTION OR INTERVENTIONS OTHER THAN YOGA (POSTURAL EXERCISES MIMICKING YOGA). THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOGA AND ACCEPTANCE AND COMMITMENT THERAPY. HOWEVER NO RELIABLE CONCLUSIONS CAN BE DRAWN REGARDING THE EFFICACY OF YOGA AS A TREATMENT FOR UNCONTROLLED EPILEPSY, IN VIEW OF METHODOLOGICAL DEFICIENCIES SUCH AS LIMITED NUMBER OF STUDIES, LIMITED NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS RANDOMISED TO YOGA, LACK OF BLINDING AND LIMITED DATA ON QUALITY-OF-LIFE OUTCOME. PHYSICIAN BLINDING WOULD NORMALLY BE TAKEN TO BE THE PERSON DELIVERING THE INTERVENTION, WHEREAS WE THINK THE 'PHYSICIAN' WOULD IN FACT BE THE OUTCOME ASSESSOR (WHO COULD BE BLINDED), SO THAT WOULD BE A REDUCTION IN DETECTION BIAS RATHER THAN PERFORMANCE BIAS. IN ADDITION, EVIDENCE TO INFORM OUTCOMES IS LIMITED AND OF LOW QUALITY. FURTHER HIGH-QUALITY RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO FULLY EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR REFRACTORY EPILEPSY.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
2 2566  68 YOGA FOR DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IN PEOPLE WITH CANCER: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVE: CANCER AND ITS TREATMENT CAN LEAD TO A VARIETY OF PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL CONCERNS IMPACTING ON THOSE AFFECTED, INCLUDING SUBCLINICAL OR CLINICAL DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, WHICH IN TURN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON WELLBEING, QUALITY OF LIFE AND SURVIVAL. THE AIM OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ON SELF-REPORTED DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IN PEOPLE WITH CANCER IN RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. METHOD: SIX DATABASES WERE SEARCHED TO IDENTIFY RELEVANT STUDIES. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW PROCEDURES WERE FOLLOWED INCLUDING A QUALITY ASSESSMENT. META-ANALYSIS OF SUITABLE STUDIES WAS CONDUCTED. RESULTS: 26 STUDIES FROM OUR SEARCH CRITERIA WERE ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION FOR DEPRESSIVE AND 16 FOR ANXIETY SYMPTOMS. META-ANALYSES REVEALED EVIDENCE FOR SIGNIFICANT MEDIUM EFFECTS OF YOGA ON DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS (N = 1,486, G = -0.419, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI] = -0.558 TO -0.281, P < 0.001) AND ANXIETY (N = 977, G = -0.347, 95% CI = -0.473 TO -0.221, P < 0.001) COMPARED TO CONTROLS. SUBGROUP ANALYSES FOR DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS REVEALED SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS FOR ALL ANALYSES PERFORMED (TYPE OF CANCER, TYPE OF CONTROL, TREATMENT STATUS, DURATION OF INTERVENTION OR FREQUENCY OF YOGA SESSIONS), WITH EFFECT SIZES BEING COMPARABLE BETWEEN SUBGROUPS. SIMILAR FINDINGS WERE FOUND FOR ANXIETY SYMPTOMS EXCEPT FOR TREATMENT STATUS, WHERE THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT WAS FOUND WHEN YOGA WAS DELIVERED DURING ACTIVE TREATMENT. CONCLUSIONS: THIS REVIEW PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT IN PEOPLE WITH CANCER, YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH AMELIORATION OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND THEREFORE A PROMISING THERAPEUTIC MODALITY FOR THEIR MANAGEMENT. HOWEVER, THE POTENTIAL FOR RISK OF BIAS TOGETHER WITH CONTROL GROUP DESIGN CHALLENGES MEANS THE RESULTS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
3 2559  62 YOGA FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: A META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. OBJECTIVES: TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) USING A META-ANALYTICAL APPROACH. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) THAT EXAMINED PAIN ANDOR FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY AS TREATMENT OUTCOMES WERE INCLUDED. POST-TREATMENT AND FOLLOW-UP OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED. METHODS: A COMPREHENSIVE SEARCH OF RELEVANT ELECTRONIC DATABASES, FROM THE TIME OF THEIR INCEPTION UNTIL NOVEMBER 2011, WAS CONDUCTED. COHEN'S D EFFECT SIZES WERE CALCULATED AND ENTERED IN A RANDOM-EFFECTS MODEL. RESULTS: EIGHT RCTS MET THE CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION (EIGHT ASSESSING FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY AND FIVE ASSESSING PAIN) AND INVOLVED A TOTAL OF 743 PATIENTS. AT POST-TREATMENT, YOGA HAD A MEDIUM TO LARGE EFFECT ON FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY (D=0.645) AND PAIN (D=0.623). DESPITE A WIDE RANGE OF YOGA STYLES AND TREATMENT DURATIONS, HETEROGENEITY IN POST-TREATMENT EFFECT SIZES WAS LOW. FOLLOW-UP EFFECT SIZES FOR FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY AND PAIN WERE SMALLER, BUT REMAINED SIGNIFICANT (D=0.397 AND D=0.486, RESPECTIVELY); HOWEVER, THERE WAS A MODERATE TO HIGH LEVEL OF VARIABILITY IN THESE EFFECT SIZES. DISCUSSION: THE RESULTS OF THE PRESENT STUDY INDICATE THAT YOGA MAY BE AN EFFICACIOUS ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT FOR CLBP. THE STRONGEST AND MOST CONSISTENT EVIDENCE EMERGED FOR THE SHORT-TERM BENEFITS OF YOGA ON FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY. HOWEVER, BEFORE ANY DEFINITIVE CONCLUSIONS CAN BE DRAWN, THERE ARE A NUMBER OF METHODOLOGICAL CONCERNS THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. IN PARTICULAR, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT FUTURE RCTS INCLUDE AN ACTIVE CONTROL GROUP TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOGA HAS SPECIFIC TREATMENT EFFECTS AND WHETHER YOGA OFFERS ANY ADVANTAGES OVER TRADITIONAL EXERCISE PROGRAMS AND OTHER ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES FOR CLBP.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
4 2144  62 THE EFFECTS OF MEDITATION, YOGA, AND MINDFULNESS ON DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND STRESS IN TERTIARY EDUCATION STUDENTS: A META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: MEDITATION, YOGA, AND MINDFULNESS ARE POPULAR INTERVENTIONS AT UNIVERSITIES AND TERTIARY EDUCATION INSTITUTES TO IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH. HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS ON DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND STRESS ARE UNCLEAR. THIS STUDY ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MEDITATION, YOGA, AND MINDFULNESS ON SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND STRESS IN TERTIARY EDUCATION STUDENTS. METHODS: WE SEARCHED COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL), PUBMED, PSYCINFO AND IDENTIFIED 11,936 ARTICLES. AFTER RETRIEVING 181 PAPERS FOR FULL-TEXT SCREENING, 24 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE INCLUDED IN THE QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS. WE CONDUCTED A RANDOM-EFFECTS META-ANALYSIS AMONGST 23 STUDIES WITH 1,373 PARTICIPANTS. RESULTS: AT POST-TEST, AFTER EXCLUSION OF OUTLIERS, EFFECT SIZES FOR DEPRESSION, G = 0.42 (95% CI: 0.16-0.69), ANXIETY G = 0.46 (95% CI: 0.34-0.59), STRESS G = 0.42 (95% CI: 0.27-0.57) WERE MODERATE. HETEROGENEITY WAS LOW (I (2) = 6%). WHEN COMPARED TO ACTIVE CONTROL, THE EFFECT DECREASED TO G = 0.13 (95% CI: -0.18-0.43). NO RCT REPORTED ON SAFETY, ONLY TWO STUDIES REPORTED ON ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT, MOST STUDIES HAD A HIGH RISK OF BIAS. CONCLUSIONS: MOST STUDIES WERE OF POOR QUALITY AND RESULTS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION. OVERALL MODERATE EFFECTS WERE FOUND WHICH DECREASED SUBSTANTIALLY WHEN INTERVENTIONS WERE COMPARED TO ACTIVE CONTROL. IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER MEDITATION, YOGA OR MINDFULNESS AFFECT ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OR AFFECT HAVE ANY NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
5 2178  63 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PAIN, MOBILITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVE. TO SYSTEMATICALLY ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PAIN, MOBILITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS. METHODS. PUBMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE, THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS, PHYSIOTHERAPY EVIDENCE DATABASE (PEDRO), AND OTHER SOURCES WERE SEARCHED SYSTEMATICALLY IN THIS STUDY. TWO REVIEWERS IDENTIFIED ELIGIBLE STUDIES AND EXTRACTED DATA INDEPENDENTLY. DOWNS AND BLACK'S QUALITY INDEX WERE USED TO EVALUATE THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES. RESULTS. A TOTAL OF 9 ARTICLES (6 STUDIES) INVOLVING 372 PATIENTS WITH KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. THE MOST COMMON YOGA PROTOCOL IS 40~90 MINUTES/SESSION, LASTING FOR AT LEAST 8 WEEKS. THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON PAIN RELIEF AND FUNCTION IMPROVEMENT COULD BE SEEN AFTER TWO-WEEK INTERVENTION. CONCLUSION. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW SHOWED THAT YOGA MIGHT HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS IN RELIEVING PAIN AND MOBILITY ON PATIENTS WITH KOA, BUT THE EFFECTS ON QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) ARE UNCLEAR. BESIDES, MORE OUTCOME MEASURE RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH OF YOGA EFFECTS ON PEOPLE WITH KOA SHOULD BE CONDUCTED.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
6   83  50 A META-ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR MATERNAL DEPRESSION DURING PREGNANCY. PROMPT AND EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OF MATERNAL DEPRESSION DURING PREGNANCY IS IMPORTANT AS IT IS AN INDEPENDENT PREDICTOR OF NEGATIVE MATERNAL AND FETAL OUTCOMES. YOGA IS AN INCREASINGLY POPULAR NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL MODALITY. THIS STUDY THUS AIMED TO UNDERTAKE A META-ANALYSIS OF THE EFFICACY OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR MATERNAL DEPRESSION DURING PREGNANCY. A TOTAL OF 8 CLINICAL STUDIES WERE SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEWED, AND 6 STUDIES WITH A TOTAL OF 405 PREGNANT MOTHERS WERE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL META-ANALYSIS. APPLYING PER-PROTOCOL ANALYSIS AND A RANDOM-EFFECTS MODEL, THE POOLED STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE (SMD) FROM BASELINE DEPRESSIVE SCORE WAS -0.452 (95% CI: -0.816 TO -0.880, P=0.015), SUPPORTING A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ON MOOD. OVERALL, YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ARE A PROMISING NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL OPTION, HOWEVER, MOST TRIALS EXAMINED WERE PRELIMINARY, RECRUITED ONLY PARTICIPANTS WITH MILD DEPRESSION, DID NOT BLIND STUDY PARTICIPANTS AND HAD RELATIVELY SMALL SAMPLE SIZES. LARGER RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIALS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
7 2187  77 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH: A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: UNIVERSITIES AROUND THE WORLD ARE FACING AN EPIDEMIC OF MENTAL DISTRESS AMONG THEIR STUDENTS. THE PROBLEM IS TRULY A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE, AFFECTING MANY AND WITH SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES. THE GLOBAL BURDEN OF DISEASE-AGENDA CALLS FOR EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS WITH LASTING EFFECTS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE MENTAL HEALTH OF YOUNG ADULTS. IN THIS STUDY WE AIMED TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOGA, A POPULAR AND WIDELY AVAILABLE MIND-BODY PRACTICE, CAN IMPROVE STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH. METHODS: WE PERFORMED A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH 202 HEALTHY UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN THE OSLO AREA. THE PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSIGNED TO A YOGA GROUP OR WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP IN A 1:1 RATIO BY A SIMPLE ONLINE RANDOMISATION PROGRAM. THE INTERVENTION GROUP WAS OFFERED 24 YOGA SESSIONS OVER 12 WEEKS. MEASUREMENTS WERE TAKEN AT WEEK 0 (BASELINE), WEEK 12 (POST-INTERVENTION), AND WEEK 24 (FOLLOW-UP). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS ASSESSED BY THE HSCL-25 QUESTIONNAIRE. ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED BASED ON THE INTENTION TO TREAT-PRINCIPLE. RESULTS: BETWEEN 24 JANUARY 2017, AND 27 AUGUST 2017, WE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED 202 STUDENTS TO A YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 100), OR WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 102). COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP, THE YOGA PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DISTRESS SYMPTOMS BOTH AT POST-INTERVENTION (ADJUSTED DIFFERENCE IN THE MEAN CHANGE -0.15, 95% CI -0.26 TO -0.03, P = 0.0110) AND FOLLOW-UP (ADJUSTED DIFFERENCE IN THE MEAN CHANGE -0.18, 95% CI -0.29 TO -0.06, P = 0.0025). SLEEP QUALITY ALSO IMPROVED AT POST-INTERVENTION AND FOLLOW-UP. NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS: OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA HAS A MODERATELY LARGE AND LASTING EFFECT, AT LEAST FOR SOME MONTHS, REDUCING SYMPTOMS OF DISTRESS AND IMPROVING SLEEP QUALITY AMONG STUDENTS. FURTHER RESEARCH SHOULD SEEK WAYS TO ENHANCE THE EFFECT, ASSESS AN EVEN LONGER FOLLOW-UP PERIOD, INCLUDE ACTIVE CONTROL GROUPS, AND CONSIDER PERFORMING SIMILAR STUDIES IN OTHER CULTURAL SETTINGS.TRIAL REGISTRATION: CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT04258540.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
8 2620 114 YOGA FOR STROKE REHABILITATION. BACKGROUND: STROKE IS A MAJOR HEALTH ISSUE AND CAUSE OF LONG-TERM DISABILITY AND HAS A MAJOR EMOTIONAL AND SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACT. THERE IS A NEED TO EXPLORE OPTIONS FOR LONG-TERM SUSTAINABLE INTERVENTIONS THAT SUPPORT STROKE SURVIVORS TO ENGAGE IN MEANINGFUL ACTIVITIES TO ADDRESS LIFE CHALLENGES AFTER STROKE. REHABILITATION FOCUSES ON RECOVERY OF FUNCTION AND COGNITION TO THE MAXIMUM LEVEL ACHIEVABLE, AND MAY INCLUDE A WIDE RANGE OF COMPLEMENTARY STRATEGIES INCLUDING YOGA.YOGA IS A MIND-BODY PRACTICE THAT ORIGINATED IN INDIA, AND WHICH HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY WIDESPREAD IN THE WESTERN WORLD. RECENT EVIDENCE HIGHLIGHTS THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA FOR PEOPLE WITH A RANGE OF PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. A RECENT NON-COCHRANE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW CONCLUDED THAT YOGA CAN BE USED AS SELF-ADMINISTERED PRACTICE IN STROKE REHABILITATION. OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA, AS A STROKE REHABILITATION INTERVENTION, ON RECOVERY OF FUNCTION AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). SEARCH METHODS: WE SEARCHED THE COCHRANE STROKE GROUP TRIALS REGISTER (LAST SEARCHED JULY 2017), COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL) (LAST SEARCHED JULY 2017), MEDLINE (TO JULY 2017), EMBASE (TO JULY 2017), CINAHL (TO JULY 2017), AMED (TO JULY 2017), PSYCINFO (TO JULY 2017), LILACS (TO JULY 2017), SCIELO (TO JULY 2017), INDMED (TO JULY 2017), OTSEEKER (TO JULY 2017) AND PEDRO (TO JULY 2017). WE ALSO SEARCHED FOUR TRIALS REGISTERS, AND ONE CONFERENCE ABSTRACTS DATABASE. WE SCREENED REFERENCE LISTS OF RELEVANT PUBLICATIONS AND CONTACTED AUTHORS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. SELECTION CRITERIA: WE INCLUDED RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) THAT COMPARED YOGA WITH A WAITING-LIST CONTROL OR NO INTERVENTION CONTROL IN STROKE SURVIVORS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: TWO REVIEW AUTHORS INDEPENDENTLY EXTRACTED DATA FROM THE INCLUDED STUDIES. WE PERFORMED ALL ANALYSES USING REVIEW MANAGER (REVMAN). ONE REVIEW AUTHOR ENTERED THE DATA INTO REVMAN; ANOTHER CHECKED THE ENTRIES. WE DISCUSSED DISAGREEMENTS WITH A THIRD REVIEW AUTHOR UNTIL CONSENSUS WAS REACHED. WE USED THE COCHRANE 'RISK OF BIAS' TOOL. WHERE WE CONSIDERED STUDIES TO BE SUFFICIENTLY SIMILAR, WE CONDUCTED A META-ANALYSIS BY POOLING THE APPROPRIATE DATA. FOR OUTCOMES FOR WHICH IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE OR IMPOSSIBLE TO POOL QUANTITATIVELY, WE CONDUCTED A DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS AND PROVIDED A NARRATIVE SUMMARY. MAIN RESULTS: WE INCLUDED TWO RCTS INVOLVING 72 PARTICIPANTS. SIXTY-NINE PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED IN ONE META-ANALYSIS (BALANCE). BOTH TRIALS ASSESSED QOL, ALONG WITH SECONDARY OUTCOMES MEASURES RELATING TO MOVEMENT AND PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES; ONE ALSO MEASURED DISABILITY.IN ONE STUDY THE STROKE IMPACT SCALE WAS USED TO MEASURE QOL ACROSS SIX DOMAINS, AT BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION. THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON FIVE DOMAINS (PHYSICAL, EMOTION, COMMUNICATION, SOCIAL PARTICIPATION, STROKE RECOVERY) WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT; HOWEVER, THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE MEMORY DOMAIN WAS SIGNIFICANT (MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) 15.30, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) 1.29 TO 29.31, P = 0.03), THE EVIDENCE FOR THIS FINDING WAS VERY LOW GRADE. IN THE SECOND STUDY, QOL WAS ASSESSED USING THE STROKE-SPECIFC QOL SCALE; NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT WAS FOUND.SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED MOVEMENT, STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIABLES, PAIN, AND DISABILITY.BALANCE WAS MEASURED IN BOTH STUDIES USING THE BERG BALANCE SCALE; THE EFFECT OF INTERVENTION WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT (MD 2.38, 95% CI -1.41 TO 6.17, P = 0.22). SENSITITIVY ANALYSIS DID NOT ALTER THE DIRECTION OF EFFECT. ONE STUDY MEASURED BALANCE SELF-EFFICACY, USING THE ACTIVITIES-SPECIFIC BALANCE CONFIDENCE SCALE (MD 10.60, 95% CI -7.08,= TO 28.28, P = 0.24); THE EFFECT OF INTERVENTION WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT; THE EVIDENCE FOR THIS FINDING WAS VERY LOW GRADE.ONE STUDY MEASURED GAIT USING THE COMFORTABLE SPEED GAIT TEST (MD 1.32, 95% CI -1.35 TO 3.99, P = 0.33), AND MOTOR FUNCTION USING THE MOTOR ASSESSMENT SCALE (MD -4.00, 95% CI -12.42 TO 4.42, P = 0.35); NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT WAS FOUND BASED ON VERY LOW-GRADE EVIDENCE.ONE STUDY MEASURED DISABILITY USING THE MODIFIED RANKIN SCALE (MRS) BUT REPORTED ONLY WHETHER PARTICIPANTS WERE INDEPENDENT OR DEPENDENT. NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT WAS FOUND: (ODDS RATIO (OR) 2.08, 95% CI 0.50 TO 8.60, P = 0.31); THE EVIDENCE FOR THIS FINDING WAS VERY LOW GRADE.ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION WERE MEASURED IN ONE STUDY. THREE MEASURES WERE USED: THE GERIATRIC DEPRESSION SCALE-SHORT FORM (GCDS15), AND TWO FORMS OF STATE TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY (STAI, FORM Y) TO MEASURE STATE ANXIETY (I.E. ANXIETY EXPERIENCED IN RESPONSE TO STRESSFUL SITUATIONS) AND TRAIT ANXIETY (I.E. ANXIETY ASSOCIATED WITH CHRONIC PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS). NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT WAS FOUND FOR DEPRESSION (GDS15, MD -2.10, 95% CI -4.70 TO 0.50, P = 0.11) OR FOR TRAIT ANXIETY (STAI-Y2, MD -6.70, 95% CI -15.35 TO 1.95, P = 0.13), BASED ON VERY LOW-GRADE EVIDENCE. HOWEVER, A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT WAS FOUND FOR STATE ANXIETY: STAI-Y1 (MD -8.40, 95% CI -16.74 TO -0.06, P = 0.05); THE EVIDENCE FOR THIS FINDING WAS VERY LOW GRADE.NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED.QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCEWE ASSESSED THE QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE USING GRADE. OVERALL, THE QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE WAS VERY LOW, DUE TO THE SMALL NUMBER OF TRIALS INCLUDED IN THE REVIEW BOTH OF WHICH WERE JUDGED TO BE AT HIGH RISK OF BIAS, PARTICULARLY IN RELATION TO INCOMPLETENESS OF DATA AND SELECTIVE REPORTING, AND ESPECIALLY REGARDING THE REPRESENTATIVE NATURE OF THE SAMPLE IN ONE STUDY. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: YOGA HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR BEING INCLUDED AS PART OF PATIENT-CENTRED STROKE REHABILITATION. HOWEVER, THIS REVIEW HAS IDENTIFIED INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO CONFIRM OR REFUTE THE EFFECTIVENESS OR SAFETY OF YOGA AS A STROKE REHABILITATION TREATMENT. FURTHER LARGE-SCALE METHODOLOGICALLY ROBUST TRIALS ARE REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AS A STROKE REHABILITATION TREATMENT.	2017	

9 2539  62 YOGA FOR ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF CONTROLLED TRIALS. A GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE SUGGESTS YOGIC PRACTICES MAY BENEFIT ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES (DM2). IN THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW, WE EVALUATE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE FROM PROSPECTIVE CONTROLLED TRIALS REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA-BASED PROGRAMS ON SPECIFIC HEALTH OUTCOMES PERTINENT TO DM2 MANAGEMENT. TO IDENTIFY QUALIFYING STUDIES, WE SEARCHED NINE DATABASES AND SCANNED BIBLIOGRAPHIES OF RELEVANT REVIEW PAPERS AND ALL IDENTIFIED ARTICLES. CONTROLLED TRIALS THAT DID NOT TARGET ADULTS WITH DIABETES, INCLUDED ONLY ADULTS WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES, WERE UNDER TWO-WEEK DURATION, OR DID NOT INCLUDE QUANTITATIVE OUTCOME DATA WERE EXCLUDED. STUDY QUALITY WAS EVALUATED USING THE PEDRO SCALE. THIRTY-THREE PAPERS REPORTING FINDINGS FROM 25 CONTROLLED TRIALS (13 NONRANDOMIZED, 12 RANDOMIZED) MET OUR INCLUSION CRITERIA (N = 2170 PARTICIPANTS). COLLECTIVELY, FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGIC PRACTICES MAY PROMOTE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN SEVERAL INDICES OF IMPORTANCE IN DM2 MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING GLYCEMIC CONTROL, LIPID LEVELS, AND BODY COMPOSITION. MORE LIMITED DATA SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY ALSO LOWER OXIDATIVE STRESS AND BLOOD PRESSURE; ENHANCE PULMONARY AND AUTONOMIC FUNCTION, MOOD, SLEEP, AND QUALITY OF LIFE; AND REDUCE MEDICATION USE IN ADULTS WITH DM2. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING STUDIES, ADDITIONAL HIGH-QUALITY INVESTIGATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO CONFIRM AND FURTHER ELUCIDATE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA PROGRAMS IN POPULATIONS WITH DM2.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
10  221  64 A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF YOGA FOR HYPERTENSION. BACKGROUND: THE AIM OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS WAS TO EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE AND THE STRENGTH OF RECOMMENDATION FOR YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC MEANS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PREHYPERTENSION AND HYPERTENSION. METHODS: MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, CENTRAL, AND INDMED WERE SCREENED THROUGH FEBRUARY 2014 FOR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS (>/=8 WEEKS) COMPARED WITH USUAL CARE OR ANY ACTIVE CONTROL INTERVENTION ON BLOOD PRESSURE IN PATIENTS WITH PREHYPERTENSION (120-139/80-89 MM HG) OR HYPERTENSION (>/=140/>/=90 MM HG). RISK OF BIAS WAS ASSESSED USING THE COCHRANE RISK OF BIAS TOOL; QUALITY OF EVIDENCE WAS ASSESSED ACCORDING TO THE GRADE RECOMMENDATIONS. RESULTS: SEVEN RCTS WITH A TOTAL OF 452 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED. COMPARED WITH USUAL CARE, VERY LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE WAS FOUND FOR EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SYSTOLIC (6 RCTS, N = 278; MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) = -9.65 MM HG, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) = -17.23 TO -2.06, P = 0.01; HETEROGENEITY: I (2) = 90%, CHI(2) = 48.21, P < 0.01) AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (6 RCTS, N = 278; MD = -7.22 MM HG, 95% CI = -12.83 TO -1.62, P = 0.01; HETEROGENEITY: I (2) = 92%, CHI(2) = 64.84, P < 0.01). SUBGROUP ANALYSES REVEALED EFFECTS FOR RCTS THAT INCLUDED HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS BUT NOT FOR RCTS THAT INCLUDED BOTH HYPERTENSIVE AND PREHYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS, AS WELL AS FOR RCTS THAT ALLOWED ANTIHYPERTENSIVE COMEDICATION BUT NOT FOR THOSE THAT DID NOT. MORE ADVERSE EVENTS OCCURRED DURING YOGA THAN DURING USUAL CARE. COMPARED WITH EXERCISE, NO EVIDENCE WAS FOUND FOR EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SYSTOLIC OR DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE. CONCLUSIONS: LARGER STUDIES ARE REQUIRED TO CONFIRM THE EMERGING BUT LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE THAT YOGA MAY BE A USEFUL ADJUNCT INTERVENTION IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
11 2365  48 WALKING IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN YOGA AT REDUCING SLEEP DISTURBANCE IN CANCER PATIENTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. THIS REVIEW AIMED TO DETERMINE WHETHER WALKING IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN YOGA AT IMPROVING SLEEP DISTURBANCE IN CANCER PATIENTS. A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WAS PERFORMED IN THE PUBMED, EMBASE, CINAHL, COCHRANE LIBRARY, CNKI, AIRITI LIBRARY, AND OTHER HEALTH-RELATED DATABASES. TWENTY-FIVE STUDIES WERE IDENTIFIED WITH A TOTAL OF 1918 PARTICIPANTS. THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX WAS THE MOST COMMONLY USED OUTCOME MEASUREMENT TOOL, AND MODERATE-INTENSITY WALKING WAS THE MOST FREQUENTLY USED INTERVENTION. THE MAJORITY OF THE INCLUDED SUBJECTS WERE BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. OVERALL, WALKING SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED SLEEP DISTURBANCE COMPARED TO YOGA (P = 0.01). STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT MODERATORS INCLUDED ADHERENCE RATE FOR WALKING (P < 0.001) AND ALLOCATION CONCEALMENT AND OUTCOME MEASUREMENT TOOL FOR YOGA (P = 0.04; P = 0.03). WE CONCLUDED THAT WALKING IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN YOGA IN IMPROVING SLEEP DISTURBANCE IN CANCER PATIENTS. THUS, MODERATE-INTENSITY WALKING IS RECOMMENDED FOR CANCER PATIENTS WITH SLEEP DISTURBANCE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
12 2098  65 THE EFFECT OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. BACKGROUND: WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER (BC) ARE LIVING LONGER WITH DEBILITATING SIDE EFFECTS SUCH AS CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (CRF) THAT AFFECT OVERALL WELL-BEING. YOGA PROMOTES HEALTH, WELL-BEING AND MAY BE BENEFICIAL IN REDUCING CRF. ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN PREVIOUS SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND META-ANALYSES, THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CRF AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) REMAIN UNCLEAR, PARTICULARLY IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER TYPES OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (PA). OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO CARRY OUT A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CRF AND QOL IN WOMEN WITH BC. METHODS: ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE SEARCHED (MEDLINE, EMBASE CLASSIC+EMBASE AND EMB REVIEWS, COCHRANE CENTRAL CT) FROM INCEPTION TO MAY 2018. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE INCLUDED IF THEY WERE FULL TEXT, IN ENGLISH, INCLUDED A YOGA INTERVENTION, A COMPARATOR (INCLUDING NON-PA USUAL CARE OR ALTERNATE PA INTERVENTION), AND REPORTED ON CRF OR QOL. EFFECTS OF YOGA WERE POOLED USING STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE (SMD) VIA A RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL. RESULTS: OF THE 2468 RECORDS RETRIEVED, 24 TRIALS WERE INCLUDED; 18 STUDIES COMPARED YOGA TO A NON-PA COMPARATOR AND 6 TO A PA COMPARATOR. YOGA DEMONSTRATED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN CRF OVER NON-PA (SMD -0.30 [-0.51; -0.08]) BUT NOT PA (SMD -0.17 [-0.50; 0.17]) COMPARATORS. ADDITIONALLY, YOGA DEMONSTRATED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN QOL OVER NON-PA (SMD -0.27 [-0.46; -0.07]) BUT NOT PA (SMD 0.04 [-0.22; +0.31]) COMPARATORS. DISCUSSION: THIS META-ANALYSIS FOUND THAT YOGA PROVIDES SMALL TO MEDIUM IMPROVEMENTS IN CRF AND QOL COMPARED TO NON-PA, BUT NOT IN COMPARISON TO OTHER PA INTERVENTIONS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
13 2683  54 YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC DISEASE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: HEART DISEASE, STROKE, AND CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD) ARE THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH AND DISABILITY WORLDWIDE. ALTHOUGH INDIVIDUALS WITH THESE CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO BENEFIT FROM YOGA, ITS EFFECTIVENESS REMAINS UNCLEAR. OBJECTIVE: TO PERFORM A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA ON EXERCISE CAPACITY, HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQL), AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC DISEASE AND DESCRIBE THE STRUCTURE AND DELIVERY OF PROGRAMS. RESEARCH DESIGN: WE PERFORMED A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS EXAMINING YOGA PROGRAMS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH HEART DISEASE, STROKE, AND COPD COMPARED WITH USUAL CARE. QUALITY WAS ASSESSED USING THE COCHRANE RISK OF BIAS TOOL. META-ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED USING REVIEW MANAGER 5.3. THE PROTOCOL WAS REGISTERED ON PROSPERO (CRD42014014589). RESULTS: TEN STUDIES (431 INDIVIDUALS, MEAN AGE 56+/-8 Y) WERE INCLUDED AND WERE COMPARABLE IN THEIR DESIGN AND COMPONENTS, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE CHRONIC DISEASE. THE STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE FOR THE MEAN CHANGE IN EXERCISE CAPACITY WAS 2.69 (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, 1.39-3.99) AND FOR HRQL IT WAS 1.24 (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, -0.37 TO 2.85). SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY WERE REDUCED AFTER YOGA IN INDIVIDUALS WITH STROKE, ALTHOUGH THIS WAS NOT OBSERVED IN INDIVIDUALS WITH COPD. THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION VARIED ACROSS STUDIES WITH NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS COMPARED WITH USUAL CARE. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA PROGRAMS HAVE SIMILAR DESIGNS AND COMPONENTS ACROSS CHRONIC DISEASE POPULATIONS. COMPARED WITH USUAL CARE, YOGA RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN EXERCISE CAPACITY AND A MEAN IMPROVEMENT IN HRQL. YOGA PROGRAMS MAY BE A USEFUL ADJUNCT TO FORMAL REHABILITATION PROGRAMS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
14 1043  57 EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON FATIGUE: A META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND. RESEARCHERS AIMED AT SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEWING AND META-ANALYZING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR FATIGUE. METHODS. PUBMED/MEDLINE WAS SEARCHED UNTIL JANUARY 2012 FOR CONTROLLED CLINICAL STUDIES. TWO REVIEWERS INDEPENDENTLY EXTRACTED THE DATA. THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF THE STUDIES WAS ASSESSED. A META-ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED. RESULTS. NINETEEN CLINICAL STUDIES (TOTAL N = 948) WERE INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW. INVESTIGATED YOGA STYLES INCLUDED HATHA, IYENGAR, ASANAS, PATANJALI, SAHAJA, AND TIBETAN YOGA. PARTICIPANTS WERE SUFFERING FROM CANCER, MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, DIALYSIS, CHRONIC PANCREATITIS, FIBROMYALGIA, ASTHMA, OR WERE HEALTHY. YOGA HAD A SMALL POSITIVE EFFECT ON FATIGUE (SMD = 0.27, 59% CI = 0.23-0.31). SEVEN STUDIES RECEIVED 4 POINTS ON THE JADAD SCORE. THERE WERE BASELINE DIFFERENCES IN AT LEAST 5 STUDIES. CONCLUSION. OVERALL, THE EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON FATIGUE WERE ONLY SMALL, PARTICULARLY IN CANCER PATIENTS. ALTHOUGH YOGA IS GENERALLY A SAFE THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION AND EFFECTIVE TO ATTENUATE OTHER HEALTH-RELATED SYMPTOMS, THIS META-ANALYSIS WAS NOT ABLE TO DEFINE THE POWERFUL EFFECT OF YOGA ON PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM FATIGUE. TREATMENT EFFECTS OF YOGA COULD BE IMPROVED IN WELL-DESIGNED FUTURE STUDIES. ACCORDING TO THE GRADE RECOMMENDATIONS ASSESSING THE OVERALL QUALITY OF EVIDENCE, THERE IS A MODERATE EFFECT OF THE CONFIDENCE PLACED IN THE ESTIMATES OF THE EFFECTS DISCUSSED HERE.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
15  547  68 CONTENT, STRUCTURE, AND DELIVERY CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MANAGING HYPERTENSION: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. OBJECTIVES: THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AIMED TO SYNTHESIZE THE CONTENT, STRUCTURE, AND DELIVERY CHARACTERISTICS OF EFFECTIVE YOGA INTERVENTIONS USED FOR MANAGING HYPERTENSION AND TO COMPARE THESE CHARACTERISTICS WITH INEFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS. DESIGN AND METHOD: THE JBI AND THE PRISMA GUIDELINES WERE FOLLOWED IN THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. RCTS CONDUCTED AMONG HYPERTENSIVE ADULTS WERE INCLUDED. RCTS REPORTING AT LEAST ONE OF THE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF YOGA (I.E., ASANA, PRANAYAMA, AND DHYANA AND RELAXATION PRACTICES) AND COMPARING THEM WITH NO INTERVENTION OR ANY INTERVENTION WERE ELIGIBLE. SIXTEEN DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR PUBLISHED AND UNPUBLISHED STUDIES WITHOUT ANY DATE AND LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS TILL MARCH 15, 2021. RESULTS: THE LITERATURE SEARCH YIELDED 13,130 RECORDS. 34 RCTS (EVALUATING 38 YOGA INTERVENTIONS) MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. OVERALL, INCLUDED STUDIES HAD LOW METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY MOSTLY DUE TO INADEQUATE REPORTING. YOGA REDUCED SBP AND DBP COMPARED TO A CONTROL INTERVENTION (MD -6.49 AND -2.78; 95CI% -8.94- -4.04 AND -4.11- -1.45, RESPECTIVELY). EIGHTEEN, 14 AND 20 INTERVENTIONS WERE EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING SBP, DBP, OR EITHER, RESPECTIVELY. 13 OUT OF 20 EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS INCORPORATED ALL THE 3 MAJOR COMPONENTS OF YOGA AND ALLOCATED SIMILAR DURATIONS TO EACH COMPONENT WHEREAS INEFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS WERE MORE FOCUSED ON THE ASANA AND DURATION OF ASANA PRACTICE WAS LONGER. THE MOST COMMON DURATION AND FREQUENCY OF EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS WERE 45 MIN/SESSION (IN 5 INTERVENTIONS), 7 DAYS/WEEK (IN 5 INTERVENTIONS), AND 12 WEEKS (IN 11 INTERVENTIONS) WHEREAS THE MOST COMMON SESSION FREQUENCY WAS 2 DAYS A WEEK (IN 7 INTERVENTIONS) IN INEFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS. EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS WERE MOSTLY CENTER-BASED (IN 15 INTERVENTIONS) AND SUPERVISED (IN 16 INTERVENTIONS) AND THIS WAS SIMILAR WITH INEFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS. CONCLUSION: DESPITE THE LOW QUALITY AND HETEROGENEITY OF INCLUDED STUDIES, OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST YOGA INTERVENTIONS MAY EFFECTIVELY MANAGE HYPERTENSION. THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE EFFECTIVE AND INEFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS SUGGEST THAT EFFECTIVE YOGA INTERVENTIONS MOSTLY INCORPORATED ASANA, PRANAYAMA, AND DHYANA AND RELAXATION PRACTICES AND THEY HAD A BALANCE BETWEEN THESE THREE COMPONENTS AND INCLUDED REGULAR PRACTICE. THEY WERE MOSTLY DELIVERED IN A CENTER AND UNDER SUPERVISION. FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD CONSIDER DEVELOPING AND EVALUATING AN INTERVENTION FOR MANAGING HYPERTENSION USING THE SYNTHESIZED FINDINGS OF THE EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS IN THIS REVIEW.

16 2573  70 YOGA FOR ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS THOUGHT TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR HEALTH CONDITIONS. THE ARTICLE AIMS TO ASSESS THE CURRENT CLINICAL EVIDENCE OF YOGA FOR ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION (EH). STRATEGY: MEDLINE, EMBASE, AND THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL) IN THE COCHRANE LIBRARY WERE SEARCHED UNTIL JUNE, 2013. WE INCLUDED RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS TESTING YOGA AGAINST CONVENTIONAL THERAPY, YOGA VERSUS NO TREATMENT, YOGA COMBINED WITH CONVENTIONAL THERAPY VERSUS CONVENTIONAL THERAPY OR CONVENTIONAL THERAPY COMBINED WITH BREATH AWARENESS. STUDY SELECTION, DATA EXTRACTION, QUALITY ASSESSMENT, AND DATA ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED ACCORDING TO THE COCHRANE STANDARDS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 6 STUDIES (INVOLVING 386 PATIENTS) WERE INCLUDED. THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF THE INCLUDED TRIALS WAS EVALUATED AS GENERALLY LOW. A TOTAL OF 6 RCTS MET ALL THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. 4 OF THEM COMPARED YOGA PLUS CONVENTIONAL THERAPY WITH CONVENTIONAL THERAPY. 1 RCT DESCRIBED YOGA COMBINED WITH CONVENTIONAL THERAPY VERSUS CONVENTIONAL THERAPY COMBINED WITH BREATH AWARENESS. 2 RCT TESTED THE EFFECT OF YOGA VERSUS CONVENTIONAL THERAPY ALONE. 1 RCT DESCRIBED YOGA COMPARED TO NO TREATMENT. ONLY ONE TRIAL REPORTED ADVERSE EVENTS WITHOUT DETAILS, THE SAFETY OF YOGA IS STILL UNCERTAIN. CONCLUSIONS: THERE IS SOME ENCOURAGING EVIDENCE OF YOGA FOR LOWERING SBP AND DBP. HOWEVER, DUE TO LOW METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF THESE IDENTIFIED TRIALS, A DEFINITE CONCLUSION ABOUT THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF YOGA ON EH CANNOT BE DRAWN FROM THIS REVIEW. THEREFORE, FURTHER THOROUGH INVESTIGATION, LARGE-SCALE, PROPER STUDY DESIGNED, RANDOMIZED TRIALS OF YOGA FOR HYPERTENSION WILL BE REQUIRED TO JUSTIFY THE EFFECTS REPORTED HERE.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
17 1077  65 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PSYCHOLOGIC FUNCTION AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER: A META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS META-ANALYSIS WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PSYCHOLOGIC FUNCTION AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER. DESIGN: A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH OF PUBMED, EMBASE, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, THE CHINESE BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE DATABASE, AND THE CHINESE DIGITAL JOURNALS FULL-TEXT DATABASE WAS CARRIED OUT. RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS (RCTS) EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA, VERSUS A CONTROL GROUP RECEIVING NO INTERVENTION, ON PSYCHOLOGIC FUNCTIONING AND QOL IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER WERE INCLUDED. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF INCLUDED RCTS WAS ASSESSED ACCORDING TO THE COCHRANE HANDBOOK FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF INTERVENTIONS 5.0.1, AND DATA WERE ANALYZED USING THE COCHRANE COLLABORATION'S REVIEW MANAGER 5.1. RESULTS: SIX (6) STUDIES INVOLVING 382 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED. THE META-ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT YOGA CAN IMPROVE QOL FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER. A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT FAVORING YOGA FOR THE OUTCOME OF QOL WAS FOUND (STANDARD MEAN DIFFERENCE=0.27, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [0.02, 0.52], P=0.03). ALTHOUGH THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PSYCHOLOGIC FUNCTION OUTCOMES--SUCH AS ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, DISTRESS AND SLEEP--WERE IN THE EXPECTED DIRECTION, THESE EFFECTS WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P>0.05). FATIGUE SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: THE PRESENT DATA PROVIDED LITTLE INDICATION OF HOW EFFECTIVE YOGA MIGHT BE WHEN THEY WERE APPLIED BY WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER EXCEPT FOR MILDLY EFFECTIVE IN QOL IMPROVEMENT. THE FINDINGS WERE BASED ON A SMALL BODY OF EVIDENCE IN WHICH METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY WAS NOT HIGH. FURTHER WELL-DESIGNED RCTS WITH LARGE SAMPLE SIZE ARE NEEDED TO CLARIFY THE UTILITY OF YOGA PRACTICE FOR THIS POPULATION.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
18 1065  56 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER: A META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. BACKGROUND: COMPLICATIONS OF BREAST CANCER TREATMENT CAN CAUSE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL DISTRESS IN PATIENTS. YOGA DEMONSTRATES SUBSTANTIAL POTENTIAL AS A SUPPORTIVE THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. OUR AIM IS TO CONDUCT A META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN ENHANCING THE QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) OF PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. METHODS: WE SEARCHED FOR STUDIES PUBLISHED BEFORE MARCH 2020 IN THE PUBMED, EMBASE, AND COCHRANE LIBRARY DATABASES. INDIVIDUAL EFFECT SIZES WERE STANDARDIZED, AND THE POOLED EFFECT SIZE WAS CALCULATED USING A RANDOM EFFECT MODEL. MEASURED OUTCOMES INCLUDED QOL, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, STRESS, FATIGUE, PAIN SEVERITY, AND SLEEP QUALITY. RESULTS: IN TOTAL, 26 TRIALS INVOLVING 2069 PATIENTS WERE REVIEWED. SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENT IN QOL WAS OBSERVED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE YOGA INTERVENTION. THE POOLED MEAN DIFFERENCES IN SOCIAL (WEIGHTED MEAN DIFFERENCE [WMD]: 1.36, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI] 0.12-2.61), EMOTIONAL (WMD: 1.46, 95% CI 0.26-2.66), AND FUNCTIONAL WELL-BEING (WMD: 2.04, 95% CI 0.21-3.87) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN THE YOGA GROUP THAN IN THE CONTROL GROUP. PATIENTS PRACTICING YOGA EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN PHYSICAL WELL-BEING, MENTAL WELL-BEING, AND SLEEP QUALITY AS WELL AS REDUCTIONS IN ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, STRESS, FATIGUE, AND PAIN SEVERITY AFTER THE INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA MAY ENHANCE QOL IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER EXPERIENCING POST-TREATMENT COMPLICATIONS. THEREFORE, WE RECOMMEND YOGA AS A SUPPORTIVE THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER TO RELIEVE POST-TREATMENT DISTRESS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
19 2104  79 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON HEALTH-RELATED FITNESS AMONG PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: THERE IS A NEED FOR A TYPE OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THAT COULD ADDRESS THE CHALLENGING CYCLE OF PHYSICAL INACTIVITY, IMPAIRED HEALTH-RELATED FITNESS, AND TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM) CONDITIONS. YOGA COULD BE ONE TYPE OF EXERCISE TO OVERCOME THE BARRIERS TO ADHERE TO REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. THE CURRENT STUDY AIMED TO SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEW THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON HEALTH-RELATED FITNESS, INCLUDING CARDIORESPIRATORY FITNESS, MUSCLE STRENGTH, BODY COMPOSITION, BALANCE, AND FLEXIBILITY, AMONG PATIENTS WITH T2DM. METHODS: WE SYSTEMATICALLY SEARCHED FOUR DATABASES AND TWO REGISTRIES (PUBMED, SCOPUS, COCHRANE, EMBASE, WHO-ITCRP, AND CLINICALTRIALS.GOV) IN SEPTEMBER 2021, FOLLOWING A REGISTERED PROTOCOL ON PROSPERO (CRD42022276225). STUDY INCLUSION CRITERIA WERE T2DM PATIENTS WITH OR WITHOUT COMPLICATION, YOGA INTERVENTION AS A SINGLE COMPONENT OR AS A COMPLEMENT COMPARED TO OTHER KINDS OF EXERCISE OR AN INACTIVE CONTROL, HEALTH-RELATED FITNESS, AND A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL OR QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL WITH CONTROL GROUP DESIGN. THE ROBINS-I TOOL AND ROB 2.0 TOOL WERE USED TO ASSESS THE RISK OF BIAS IN THE INCLUDED STUDIES. A VOTE-COUNTING ANALYSIS AND META-ANALYSIS COMPUTED USING RANDOM EFFECTS' MODELS WERE CONDUCTED. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 10 RECORDS FROM 3 QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL AND 7 RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIALS WITH 815 PARTICIPANTS IN TOTAL WERE INCLUDED. THE META-ANALYSIS FAVORED YOGA GROUPS COMPARED TO INACTIVE CONTROLS IN IMPROVING MUSCLE STRENGTH BY 3.42 (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL 2.42 TO 4.43), REPETITIONS OF CHAIR STAND TEST, AND IMPROVING CARDIORESPIRATORY FITNESS BY 6.6% (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL 0.4 TO 12.8) IMPROVEMENT OF BASELINE FORCED VITAL CAPACITY.

20 2647  62 YOGA HAS A SOLID EFFECT ON CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER: A META-ANALYSIS. PURPOSE: THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO CRITICALLY EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. METHODS: EIGHT DATABASES (COCHRANE LIBRARY, PUBMED, OVID-MEDLINE, WEB OF SCIENCE, CBM, WANFANG, VIP, AND CNKI) WERE SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEWED FROM INCEPTION TO JANUARY 2019 FOR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS). TWO REVIEWERS CRITICALLY AND INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSED THE RISK OF BIAS USING COCHRANE COLLABORATION CRITERIA AND EXTRACTED CORRELATED DATA USING THE DESIGNED FORM. ALL ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED WITH REVIEW MANAGER 5.3. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 17 QUALIFIED STUDIES THAT INCLUDED 2183 PATIENTS (YOGA: 1112, CONTROL: 1071) WERE INCLUDED IN THE META-ANALYSIS. YOGA HAD A LARGE EFFECT ON FATIGUE IN POST-TREATMENT BREAST CANCER PATIENTS AND HAD A SMALL EFFECT ON INTRA-TREATMENT PATIENTS. THE META-ANALYSIS ALSO INDICATED THAT SUPERVISED YOGA CLASS HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON CRF; THE SIX-WEEK PROGRAM HAD A MODERATE BENEFICIAL EFFECT WHILE THE 60/90 MIN/SESSION SUPERVISED YOGA CLASS AND THE EIGHT-WEEK PROGRAM DEMONSTRATED A LARGE EFFECT ON FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. YOGA COULD MARKEDLY MITIGATE THE PHYSICAL FATIGUE IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS, HAD A MEDIUM IMPACT ON COGNITIVE FATIGUE, AND MANIFESTED A SMALL EFFECT ON MENTAL FATIGUE. EIGHT STUDIES REPORTED THE ADVERSE EVENTS, WHEREAS TEN STUDIES DID NOT.

2 1999 28 STRESS DUE TO EXAMS IN MEDICAL STUDENTS--ROLE OF YOGA. A STUDENT UNDER OPTIMAL STRESS DOES BRING OUT HIS OR HER BEST, HOWEVER EXTREMES OF STRESS CAN RESULT IN STRESS INDUCED DISORDERS AND DETERIORATING PERFORMANCE. CAN YOGA BE OF BENEFIT IN STRESS INDUCED EFFECTS IN MEDICAL STUDENTS? THE PRESENT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN FIRST MBBS STUDENTS (N = 50) TO DETERMINE THE BENEFIT IF ANY OF YOGIC PRACTICES ON ANXIETY STATUS DURING ROUTINE ACTIVITIES AND PRIOR TO EXAMINATION. FEEDBACK SCORES WERE ASSESSED TO DETERMINE HOW THE STUDENTS HAD BENEFITED FROM THE PRACTICES. ANXIETY STATUS AS ASSESSED BY SPILLBERGER'S ANXIETY SCALE SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION FOLLOWING PRACTICE. IN ADDITION THE ANXIETY SCORE WHICH ROSE PRIOR TO EXAMS SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION ON THE DAY OF EXAM AFTER PRACTICE. THESE RESULTS POINT TO THE BENEFICIAL ROLE OF YOGA IN NOT ONLY CAUSING REDUCTION IN BASAL ANXIETY LEVEL BUT ALSO ATTENUATING THE INCREASE IN ANXIETY SCORE IN STRESSFUL STATE SUCH AS EXAMS. THE RESULTS OF THE EXAM INDICATED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN NUMBER OF FAILURES IN YOGA GROUP AS COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. THE IMPROVEMENT IN VARIOUS PARAMETERS SUCH AS BETTER SENSE OF WELL BEING, FEELING OF RELAXATION, IMPROVED CONCENTRATION, SELF CONFIDENCE, IMPROVED EFFICIENCY, GOOD INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIP, INCREASED ATTENTIVENESS, LOWERED IRRITABILITY LEVELS, AND AN OPTIMISTIC OUTLOOK IN LIFE WERE SOME OF THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ENJOYED BY THE YOGA GROUP INDICATED BY FEEDBACK SCORE.	1999	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
3  716 34 EFFECT OF INTEGRATED YOGA PRACTICES ON IMMUNE RESPONSES IN EXAMINATION STRESS - A PRELIMINARY STUDY. BACKGROUND: STRESS IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED OCCURRENCE OF AUTONOMIC, CARDIOVASCULAR, AND IMMUNE SYSTEM PATHOLOGY. THIS STUDY WAS DONE TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF STRESS ON PSYCHOLOGICAL, PHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS, AND IMMUNE SYSTEM DURING MEDICAL TERM -ACADEMIC EXAMINATION AND THE EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICES ON THE SAME. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT ON SIXTY FIRST-YEAR MBBS STUDENTS RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO YOGA GROUP AND CONTROL GROUP (30 EACH). THE YOGA GROUP UNDERWENT INTEGRATED YOGA PRACTICES FOR 35 MINUTES DAILY IN THE PRESENCE OF TRAINED YOGA TEACHER FOR 12 WEEKS. CONTROL GROUP DID NOT UNDERGO ANY KIND OF YOGA PRACTICE OR STRESS MANAGEMENT. PHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS LIKE HEART RATE, RESPIRATORY RATE, AND BLOOD PRESSURE WERE MEASURED. GLOBAL ASSESSMENT OF RECENT STRESS SCALE AND SPIELBERGERS STATE ANXIETY SCORE WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND DURING THE EXAMINATION. SERUM CORTISOL LEVELS, IL-4, AND IFN-GAMMA LEVELS WERE DETERMINED BY ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY TECHNIQUE. RESULT: IN THE YOGA GROUP, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED IN PHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS DURING THE EXAMINATION STRESS, WHEREAS IN THE CONTROL GROUP, A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE WAS OBSERVED. LIKEWISE, THE INDICATORS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS SHOWED HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN CONTROL GROUP COMPARED WITH SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN YOGA GROUP. DURING THE EXAMINATION, THE INCREASE IN SERUM CORTICAL AND DECREASE IN SERUM IFN-GAMMA IN YOGA GROUP WAS LESS SIGNIFICANT (P<0.01) THAN IN THE CONTROL GROUP (P<0.001). BOTH THE GROUPS DEMONSTRATED AN INCREASE IN SERUM IL-4 LEVELS, THE CHANGES BEING INSIGNIFICANT FOR THE DURATION OF THE STUDY. CONCLUSION: YOGA RESISTS THE AUTONOMIC CHANGES AND IMPAIRMENT OF CELLULAR IMMUNITY SEEN IN EXAMINATION STRESS.	2011	
                            
4 1583 30 MEDICAL STUDENTS' STRESS LEVELS AND SENSE OF WELL BEING AFTER SIX WEEKS OF YOGA AND MEDITATION. OBJECTIVE. TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF SIX WEEKS OF YOGA AND MEDITATION ON MEDICAL STUDENTS' LEVELS OF PERCEIVED STRESS AND SENSE OF WELLBEING PRIOR TO TAKING THEIR EXAMS. METHODS. WE CONDUCTED A PROSPECTIVE CASE-CONTROL STUDY OF FIRST-THROUGH-THIRD-YEAR MEDICAL STUDENTS AT OUR ACADEMIC INSTITUTION, MEASURING LEVELS OF PERCEIVED STRESS AND SENSE OF WELLBEING BEFORE AND AFTER A SIX-WEEK YOGA AND MEDITATION INTERVENTION. QUESTIONNAIRES USED FOR EVALUATION INCLUDED THE PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE (PSS) AND SELF-ASSESSMENT SURVEYS (SAS). THE POSTINTERVENTION SURVEYS WERE COMPLETED ON THE DAY OF THE STUDENTS' WRITTEN EXAMS. RESULTS. A TOTAL OF THIRTEEN WOMEN AND FOURTEEN MEN PARTICIPATED. MEDIAN AGE WAS 28 (24 YRS-32 YRS). 48.1% WERE CAUCASIAN, 7.4% BLACK, 11.1% HISPANIC, 11.1% ASIAN, AND 22.2% OTHER. PAIRED T-TESTS SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PERCEIVED STRESS (18.44 VERSUS 14.52; P = 0.004) AFTER THE SIX-WEEK YOGA AND MEDITATION PROGRAM. AFTER THE YOGA INTERVENTION, SELF-ASSESSMENT SURVEY RESULTS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN FEELINGS OF PEACE, FOCUS, AND ENDURANCE. IMPROVEMENTS IN HAPPINESS, POSITIVITY, PERSONAL SATISFACTION, AND SELF-CONFIDENCE WERE ALSO SEEN. AN IMPROVEMENT IN UNSUBSTANTIATED PARAMETERS SUCH AS PATIENCE AND FATIGUE WAS OBSERVED. CONCLUSION. YOGA AND MEDITATION MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING STRESS LEVELS AND IMPROVING ASPECTS OF PERSONAL WELLBEING IN MEDICAL STUDENTS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
5  814 21 EFFECT OF YOGA ON CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM IN SUBJECTS ABOVE 40 YEARS. THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTION IN SUBJECTS ABOVE 40 YRS OF AGE. PULSE RATE, SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND VALSALVA RATIO WERE STUDIED IN 50 CONTROL SUBJECTS (NOT DOING ANY TYPE OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE) AND 50 STUDY SUBJECTS WHO HAD BEEN PRACTICING YOGA FOR 5 YEARS. FROM THE STUDY IT WAS OBSERVED THAT SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE PULSE RATE OCCURS IN SUBJECTS PRACTICING YOGA (P<0.001). THE DIFFERENCE IN THE MEAN VALUES OF SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE BETWEEN STUDY GROUP AND CONTROL GROUP WAS ALSO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P<0.01 AND P<0.001 RESPECTIVELY). THE SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE SHOWED SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATION WITH AGE IN THE STUDY GROUP (R1 SYSTOLIC= 0.631 AND R1 DIASTOLIC = 0.610) AS WELL AS IN THE CONTROL GROUP (R2 SYSTOLIC = 0.981 AND R2 DIASTOLIC = 0.864). THE SIGNIFICANCE OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CORRELATION COEFFICIENT OF BOTH THE GROUPS WAS ALSO TESTED WITH THE USE OF Z TRANSFORMATION AND THE DIFFERENCE WAS SIGNIFICANT (Z SYSTOLIC= 4.041 AND Z DIASTOLIC= 2.901). VALSALVA RATIO WAS ALSO FOUND TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN YOGA PRACTITIONERS THAN IN CONTROLS (P<0.001). OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT YOGA REDUCES THE AGE RELATED DETERIORATION IN CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTIONS.	2003	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
6 1835 22 PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES AT THE TIME OF EXAMINATION IN MEDICAL STUDENTS BEFORE AND AFTER THE PRACTICE OF YOGA AND RELAXATION. THE EFFECT OF YOGA AND RELAXATION CHANGES IN PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS IN RESPONSE TO THE STRESS OF EXAMINATION IN 75 MEDICAL STUDENTS WAS STUDIED. INITIALLY FIVE PARAMETERS (ANXIETY LEVEL, HEART RATE, BLOOD PRESSURE, GALVANIC SKIN RESISTANCE AND CHOICE REACTION TIME) WERE RECORDED, A MONTH BEFORE THE EXAMINATION AND ON THE DAY OF EXAMINATION. STUDENTS WERE THEN RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO 3 GROUP OF 25 EACH. ONE GROUP PRACTICED YOGA (GROUP- Y), AND ANOTHER GROUP PRACTICED RELAXATION (GROUP-R) REGULARLY FOR THREE MONTHS. THE THIRD GROUP WAS CONTROL GROUP (GROUP-C). ALL THE PARAMETERS WERE RECORDED AFTER THE CHANGES IN ANXIETY LEVEL, HEART RATE, BLOOD PRESSURE, AND GALVANIC SKIN RESISTANCE IN RESPONSE TO STRESS OF EXAMINATION WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ATTENUATED AND THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN CHOICE REACTION TIME IN GROUP-Y AND GROUP-R AS COMPARED TO GROUP-C AFTER YOGA AND RELAXATION.	1998	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
7  750 22 EFFECT OF SAHAJA YOGA PRACTICE ON STRESS MANAGEMENT IN PATIENTS OF EPILEPSY. AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF SAHAJA YOGA MEDITATION IN STRESS MANAGEMENT IN PATIENTS OF EPILEPSY. THE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT ON 32 PATIENTS OF EPILEPSY WHO WERE RENDOMLY DIVIDED INTO 3 GROUPS: GROUP I SUBJECTS PRACTISED SAHAJA YOGA MEDITATION FOR 6 MONTHS, GROUP II SUBJECTS PRACTISED POSTURAL EXERCISES MIMICKING SAHAJA YOGA AND GROUP III SERVED AS THE EPILEPTIC CONTROL GROUP. GALVANIC SKIN RESISTANCE (GSR), BLOOD LACTATE AND URINARY VINYL MANDELIC ACID (U-VMA) WERE RECORDED AT 0, 3 AND 6 MONTHS. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AT 3 & 6 MONTHS AS COMPARED TO 0 MONTH VALUES IN GSR, BLOOD LACTATE AND U-VMA LEVELS IN GROUP I SUBJECTS, BUT NOT IN GROUP II AND GROUP III SUBJECTS. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT REDUCTION IN STRESS FOLLOWING SAHAJA YOGA PRACTICE MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR CLINICAL IMPROVEMENT WHICH HAD BEEN EARLIER REPORTED IN PATIENTS WHO PRACTISED SAHAJA YOGA.	1995

RESULTS: THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP REPORTED REDUCTION IN MEAN VALUE IN GALVANIC SKIN RESPONSE (GSR) WHEN THEY UNDERWENT DEEP YOGIC BREATHING, LISTENED TO RELIGIOUS HYMNS AND LISTENED TO FLUTE MUSIC. CONCLUSION: ON THE BASIS OF THE RESULTS, THE RESEARCHERS SUGGEST THAT ALL THREE TECHNIQUES I.E PRACTICING YOGIC BREATHING, LISTENING TO RELIGIOUS HYMNS AND LISTENING TO FLUTE MUSIC WERE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE STRESS LEVEL OF ENGINEERING STUDENTS. LISTENING TO FLUTE MUSIC EMERGED FROM THESE THREE DRILLS, AS THE MOST EFFECTIVE STIMULUS FOR STRESS MANAGEMENT.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
10 1504 30 INVESTIGATION OF YOGA PRANAYAMA AND VEDIC MATHEMATICS ON MINDFULNESS, AGGRESSION AND EMOTION REGULATION. BACKGROUND: COMPETITIVE EXAMINATIONS, PARTICULARLY IN MATHEMATICS, HAVE MADE EMOTIONAL STRESS A MAJOR PROBLEM FOR PREUNIVERSITY STUDENTS, EMOTIONS LIKE AGGRESSION TOWARD FELLOW STUDENTS AND TEACHERS INCREASE. MINDFULNESS IS A QUALITY THAT REDUCES BOTH EMOTIONAL STRESS AND AGGRESSION, SO INCREASING MINDFULNESS SHOULD BE HELPFUL. AIMS: TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF YOGA PRANAYAMA (YP) AND VEDIC MATHEMATICS (VM) ON MINDFULNESS, AGGRESSION, AND EMOTION REGULATION. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE 12(TH) GRADERS ATTENDING A PREUNIVERSITY COLLEGE IN CHIKKAMAGALURU, INDIA, OF BOTH GENDERS. EXCLUSION CRITERIA INCLUDED MAJOR PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS. THREE CLASSES WERE ARBITRARILY ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THREE INTERVENTIONS, WHICH CONSISTED OF 15 DAYS EACH OF 30 MIN DAILY INSTRUCTION IN YP, GROUP 1, VM, GROUP 2, OR 30 MIN ORDINARY CLASS WORK, GROUP 3, THE CONTROL GROUP. ASSESSMENTS WERE MADE USING THE MINDFULNESS ATTENTION AWARENESS SCALE, THE NONPHYSICAL AGGRESSION SCALE FROM PITTSBURGH YOUTH STUDY, AND THE EMOTION REGULATION QUESTIONNAIRE. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: SPSS 19.0. RESULTS: MINDFULNESS, AGGRESSION, AND NEGATIVE EMOTIONAL REGULATION CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY FOR THE YP GROUP, WHILE MINDFULNESS ALONE IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY FOR THE VM GROUP. NO GROUP CHANGED ON POSITIVE EMOTION REGULATION. CONTROLS APPARENTLY IMPROVED ON AGGRESSION. AN INTERESTING POST HOC CORRELATION ANALYSIS IS ALSO REPORTED, AMONG OTHER THINGS DIRECTLY LINKING INCREASED MINDFULNESS TO DECREASED AGGRESSION. CONCLUSIONS: THE STUDY SHOWED POSITIVE EFFECTS OF TRADITIONAL METHODS OF DECREASING EMOTIONAL PRESSURE ON STUDENTS FACING PREUNIVERSITY MATHEMATICS EXAMINATIONS. INCREASING MINDFULNESS IS CONSIDERED A WAY OF INCREASING EMOTION REGULATION, SO THE FAILURE OF THIS STUDY TO PROVIDE EVIDENCE FOR THAT IS OF INTEREST.	2017	

11  525 20 COMPARISON OF EFFECTS OF YOGA & PHYSICAL EXERCISE IN ATHLETES. THE EFFECT OF PRANAYAMA A CONTROLLED BREATHING PRACTICE, ON EXERCISE TESTS WAS STUDIED IN ATHLETES IN TWO PHASES; SUB-MAXIMAL AND MAXIMAL EXERCISE TESTS. AT THE END OF PHASE I (ONE YEAR) BOTH THE GROUPS (CONTROL AND EXPERIMENTAL) ACHIEVED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER WORK RATE AND REDUCTION IN OXYGEN CONSUMPTION PER UNIT WORK. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN BLOOD LACTATE AND AN INCREASE IN P/L RATIO IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP, AT REST. AT THE END OF PHASE II (TWO YEARS), THE OXYGEN CONSUMPTION PER UNIT WORK WAS FOUND TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED AND THE WORK RATE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP. BLOOD LACTATE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AT REST IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP ONLY. PYRUVATE AND PYRUVATE-LACTATE RATIO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN BOTH THE GROUPS AFTER EXERCISE AND AT REST IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP. THE RESULTS IN BOTH PHASES SHOWED THAT THE SUBJECTS WHO PRACTISED PRANAYAMA COULD ACHIEVE HIGHER WORK RATES WITH REDUCED OXYGEN CONSUMPTION PER UNIT WORK AND WITHOUT INCREASE IN BLOOD LACTATE LEVELS. THE BLOOD LACTATE LEVELS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOW AT REST.	1994

13  812 24 EFFECT OF YOGA ON CARDIAC AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION AND INSULIN RESISTANCE IN NON-DIABETIC OFFSPRING OF TYPE-2-DIABETES PARENTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. OBJECTIVE: THE PRESENT STUDY WAS AIMED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA PROGRAM ON CARDIAC AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION AND INSULIN RESISTANCE IN NON-DIABETIC OFFSPRING OF DIABETES PARENTS. METHODS: A RANDOMIZED PASSIVE-CONTROLLED STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON 64 NON-DIABETIC OFFSPRING OF TYPE-2-DIABETES PARENTS (MEAN-AGE:25.17YEARS). YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED YOGA TRAINING FOR 8 WEEKS. HEART-RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) INDICES: LOW FREQUENCY (LF), HIGH FREQUENCY (HF) AND LF/HF RATIO; FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE (FBG), ORAL GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST (OGTT) AND INSULIN RESISTANCE (IR) WERE ESTIMATED AT BASELINE AND AFTER 8-WEEKS OF INTERVENTION. RESULTS: WE FOUND A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN LF (P=0.005), LF/HF RATIO (P=0.004), IR (P<0.001), OGTT (P=0.003) AND INCREASE IN HF (P=0.022) IN YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS. CONTROL GROUP PARTICIPANTS DID NOT SHOW ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN ANY VARIABLES. CONCLUSIONS: IMPROVEMENT IN CARDIAC AUTONOMIC FUNCTION AND INSULIN RESISTANCE BY YOGA TRAINING IMPLIES THAT YOGA CAN REDUCE THE RISK OF DEVELOPMENT OF DIABETES IN OFFSPRING OF DIABETES PARENTS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
14 2234 24 THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON TEACHERS' SELF-RATED EMOTIONS. OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS (I) IF TEACHERS' AGE OR GENDER COULD PREDICT THEIR BASELINE LEVELS OF MENTAL WELL-BEING AND ANXIETY AND ANY CHANGE AFTER YOGA. (II) WHETHER MENTAL WELL-BEING OR ANXIETY CHANGED FOLLOWING 15 DAYS OF YOGA IN PRIMARY SCHOOL TEACHERS. PRIMARY SCHOOL TEACHERS TOOK PART IN THIS SINGLE GROUP LONGITUDINAL TRIAL (N = 302, GROUP MEAN AGE +/- SD; 41.8 +/- 5.90 YEARS). THEY RECEIVED 240 MIN OF YOGA PRACTICE AND 120 MIN OF YOGA THEORY EACH DAY. AT BASELINE AND AFTER 15 DAYS OF YOGA THE ASSESSMENTS WERE (I) MENTAL WELL-BEING (WARWICK-EDINBURGH SCALE) AND (II) STATE ANXIETY (SPIELBERGER'S STATE TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY). RESULTS: GENDER ACTED AS A SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR FOR MENTAL WELL-BEING SCORES (P = 0.001) AND STATE ANXIETY (P = 0.005) IN THE GROUP AT BASELINE. FEMALES SHOWED HIGHER ANXIETY SCORES AND LOWER MENTAL WELL-BEING SCORES. FOLLOWING YOGA THE TEACHERS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN MENTAL WELL-BEING BY 5.84% AND A DECREASE IN STATE ANXIETY BY 4.48%.

15 2424 24 YOGA AND MUSIC INTERVENTION TO REDUCE DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND STRESS DURING COVID-19 OUTBREAK ON HEALTHCARE WORKERS. AIM: TO INVESTIGATE IMPACT OF YOGA AND MUSIC INTERVENTION ON ANXIETY, STRESS, AND DEPRESSION LEVELS OF HEALTH CARE WORKERS DURING THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK. METHODS: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO ASSESS PSYCHOLOGICAL RESPONSES OF 240 HEALTHCARE WORKERS DURING COVID-19 OUTBREAK. WE USED YOGA AND MUSIC INTERVENTION IN NORMAL AND ABNORMAL SUBJECTS BASED ON DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND STRESS SCALE-42 (DASS-42). RESULTS: OF ALL 209 PARTICIPANTS, 105 (50.23%) HAD SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION (35.88%), ANXIETY (40.19), AND STRESS (34.92%) ALONE OR IN COMBINATION. THE DATA SUGGEST THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN TEST SCORES AFTER INTERVENTION. MAJORITY OF PERSONS WITH ABNORMAL SCORE EXHIBITED IMPROVED DASS-42 SCORE ON COMBINED INTERVENTIONS OF YOGA AND MUSIC COMPARED TO CONTROL GROUP. EVEN SUBJECTS WITHOUT ABNORMALITIES ON DASS-42 SCORE ALSO SHOWED IMPROVED DASS-42 SCORES IN INTERVENTION (N = 52) GROUP COMPARED TO NONINTERVENTION (N = 52) GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: OUR FINDINGS HIGHLIGHTED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF EASILY AVAILABLE, SIMPLE, INEXPENSIVE, SAFE NONPHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS LIKE YOGA AND MUSIC THERAPY TO OVERCOME STRESS, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION IN PRESENT TIMES.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
16  850 25 EFFECT OF YOGA ON SHORT-TERM HEART RATE VARIABILITY MEASURE AS A STRESS INDEX IN SUBJUNIOR CYCLISTS: A PILOT STUDY. SUBJUNIOR ATHLETES EXPERIENCE MENTAL STRESS DUE TO PRESSURE FROM THE COACH, TEACHERS AND PARENTS FOR BETTER PERFORMANCE. STRESS, IF REMAINS FOR LONGER PERIOD AND NOT MANAGED APPROPRIATELY CAN LEADS TO NEGATIVE PHYSICAL, MENTAL AND COGNITIVE IMPACT ON CHILDREN. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF INTEGRATED YOGA MODULE ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) MEASURE AS A STRESS INDEX IN SUBJUNIOR CYCLISTS. FAST FURRIER TRANSFORM TECHNIQUE OF FREQUENCY DOMAIN METHOD WAS USED FOR THE ANALYSIS OF HRV. WE HAVE FOUND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN HIGH FREQUENCY (HF) COMPONENT BY 14.64% (P < 0.05) AND DECREASE IN THE LOW FREQUENCY COMPONENT (LF) OF HRV SPECTRUM BY 5.52% (P < 0.05) AND A DECREASE IN LF/HF RATIO BY 19.63% (P < 0.01) IN YOGA GROUP. IN THE CONTROL GROUP, THERE WAS DECREASE IN THE HF COMPONENT AND, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE LF COMPONENT OF HRV SPECTRUM AND LF/HF RATIO. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT YOGA PRACTICE DECREASES SYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY AND CAUSES A SHIFT IN THE AUTONOMIC BALANCE TOWARDS PARASYMPATHETIC DOMINANCE INDICATING A REDUCTION IN STRESS. IN CONCLUSION, YOGA PRACTICE HELPS TO REDUCE STRESS BY OPTIMIZING THE AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS. SO, IT IS SUGGESTED TO INCORPORATE YOGA MODULE AS A REGULAR FEATURE TO KEEP SUBJUNIOR ATHLETES BOTH MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY FIT.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
17  369 18 AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS IN RAJA-YOGA MEDITATORS. STRESS, AN INEVITABLE AND CONSTANT FEATURE THROUGHOUT THE LIFETIME, INDUCES AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTIONS, FOR WHICH MEDITATION IS CONSIDERED TO BE AN ANTIDOTE. SO THE CASE CONTROL STUDY WAS PLANNED INCLUDING 50 RAJA-YOGA MEDITATORS PRACTICING MEDITATION FOR 5 YEARS AND 50 AGE MATCHED NON-MEDITATORS. AUTONOMIC FUNCTION TESTS WERE PERFORMED AND RESULTS WERE COMPARED USING THE STUDENT-T TEST. MEAN VALUES OF RESTING HR, SBP AND DBP WERE LESS IN MEDITATORS. GALVANIC SKIN RESPONSE IN MEDITATORS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE (P < 0.001). MEAN INCREASE BP RESPONSE TO HAND GRIP TEST AND COLD PRESSOR TEST WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS IN MEDITATORS THAN NON-MEDITATORS (P < 0.001). STANDING: LYING RATIO, VALSALVA RATIO, INSPIRATION: EXPIRATION RATIO AND 30:15 RATIOS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN MEDITATORS THAN NON-MEDITATORS. FROM THE RESULTS, THERE WAS SHIFTING OF THE AUTONOMIC BALANCE TO PARASYMPATHETIC SIDE IN RAJA-YOGA MEDITATORS, WHICH SUGGESTS ITS UTILITY TO COMBAT THE ILL EFFECTS OF STRESS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
18 1744 19 PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF HATHA-YOGA EXERCISE IN HEALTHY WOMEN. HATHA-YOGA HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY POPULAR IN WESTERN COUNTRIES AS A METHOD FOR COPING WITH STRESS. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF YOGA PRACTICE. WE MEASURED HEART RATE, BLOOD PRESSURE, THE HORMONES CORTISOL, PROLACTIN AND GROWTH HORMONE AND CERTAIN PSYCHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS IN A YOGA PRACTICING GROUP AND A CONTROL GROUP OF YOUNG FEMALE VOLUNTEERS READING IN A COMFORTABLE POSITION DURING THE EXPERIMENTAL PERIOD. THERE WERE NO SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GROUPS CONCERNING ENDOCRINE PARAMETERS AND BLOOD PRESSURE. THE COURSE OF HEART RATE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT, THE YOGA GROUP HAD A DECREASE DURING THE YOGA PRACTICE. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BOTH GROUPS WERE FOUND IN PSYCHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS. IN THE PERSONALITY INVENTORY THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED MARKEDLY HIGHER SCORES IN LIFE SATISFACTION AND LOWER SCORES IN EXCITABILITY, AGGRESSIVENESS, OPENNESS, EMOTIONALITY AND SOMATIC COMPLAINTS. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES COULD ALSO BE OBSERVED CONCERNING COPING WITH STRESS AND THE MOOD AT THE END OF THE EXPERIMENT. THE YOGA GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANT HIGHER SCORES IN HIGH SPIRITS AND EXTRAVERTEDNESS.	1994	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
19 1938 23 ROLE OF YOGA ON CARDIC AUTONOMIC FUNCTION TESTS AND COGNITION IN TYPE 2 DIABETES. ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL DIABETIC FEDERATION, TYPE 2 DIABETIC POPULATION IS ON THE RISE GLOBALLY AND COGNITIVE DECLINE IS ONE OF THE COMPLICATIONS SEEN IN TYPE 2 DIABETES. THE PRESENT STUDY IS AIMED AT EXPLORING THE ROLE OF REGULAR PRACTICE OF YOGA ON COGNITION IN TYPE 2 DIABETES AND ALSO TO STUDY THE RELATION BETWEEN THE COGNITION AND FUNCTIONAL STATUS OF AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM BY CONSIDERING THE CARDIAC AUTONOMIC (CAN) FUNCTION TESTS. TEN TYPE 2 DIABETIC SUBJECTS OF BOTH THE SEX, AGED BETWEEN 35-55 YEARS, WHO PRACTICED YOGA FOR A PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS AT YOGI VEMANA YOGA RESEARCH INSTITUTE WERE RECRUITED AS TEST GROUP. AGE AND SEX MATCHED TEN TYPE 2 DIABETIC SUBJECTS WERE RECRUITED AS CONTROL GROUP; BOTH THE GROUP SUBJECTS ARE ON ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC AGENTS. GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN CONCENTRATION WAS ESTIMATED WITH BIO-RAD INSTRUMENT, COGNITION WAS ASSESSED WITH ADDENBROOKE'S COGNITIVE EXAMINATION REVISED BATTERY AND CARDIAC AUTONOMIC FUNCTION TESTS WERE ALSO CONDUCTED. UNPAIRED STUDENT T TEST WAS PERFORMED AND P<0.05 IS CONSIDERED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. THE MEAN HBA1C CONCENTRATION IN CONTROL AND TEST GROUP SUBJECTS IS 7.8+/-1.84 AND 6.9+/-0.4% (P=0.03) RESPECTIVELY. MEAN COGNITIVE SCORES IN TEST AND CONTROL GROUP SUBJECTS ARE 93+/-4.5 AND 85+/-4.0 (P=0.008) RESPECTIVELY. CAN TEST RESULTS DIDN'T SHOWED ANY SIGNIFICANCE BETWEEN THE TEST AND CONTROL GROUP. BUT CAN FUNCTIONS ARE AFFECTED IN BOTH THE GROUPS. REGULAR PRACTICE OF YOGA IN COMBINATION WITH ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC AGENTS HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON COGNITION IN TYPE 2 DIABETES.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
20  862 31 EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICES ON GENERAL MENTAL ABILITY IN URBAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL CHILDREN. INTRODUCTION MENTAL ABILITY OF CHILDREN REPRESENTS FUNCTIONING OF BRAIN IN DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF COMPETENCY INCLUDING VERBAL, MATHEMATICAL, LOGICAL REASONING AND SPATIAL, WHICH IS OF PRIME IMPORTANCE FOR ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. OBJECTIVE THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON GENERAL MENTAL ABILITY OF URBAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL CHILDREN. METHODS SIXTY-SIX URBAN SCHOOL CHILDREN AGED 11-15YEARS WERE SELECTED AS PARTICIPANTS. ALL THE SELECTED PARTICIPANTS WERE STAYING IN A RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL IN PUNE DISTRICT. A STRATIFIED RANDOM SAMPLING METHOD WAS USED TO DIVIDE THE STUDENTS INTO EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUPS. THERE WERE 32 STUDENTS IN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND 29 STUDENTS IN CONTROL GROUP. BOTH EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUPS WERE ASSESSED FOR GENERAL MENTAL ABILITY BY USING STANDARD QUESTIONNAIRE AT THE BASELINE AND AT THE END OF 12WEEKS OF YOGA TRAINING. THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS OF EXPERIMENTAL GROUP UNDERWENT YOGA TRAINING FOR 12WEEKS, FOR 1 H IN THE MORNING FOR A PERIOD OF 12WEEKS. THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT UNDERGO ANY YOGA TRAINING DURING THIS TIME PERIOD. RESULTS THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PARTICIPANTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN GENERAL MENTAL ABILITY AS COMPARED TO CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY INDICATE THAT YOGA PRACTICES COULD IMPROVE GENERAL MENTAL ABILITY OF URBAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL CHILDREN.	2020

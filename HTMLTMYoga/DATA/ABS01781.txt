1 1781 138 PREDICTORS OF AND BARRIERS TO ADHERENCE IN A 16-WEEK RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF BIKRAM YOGA IN STRESSED AND SEDENTARY ADULTS. BACKGROUND: BIKRAM YOGA MAY ENHANCE HEALTH OUTCOMES IN HEALTHY ADULTS AND THOSE AT RISK FOR CHRONIC DISEASE, HOWEVER, CHALLENGES REMAIN IN ACHIEVING OPTIMAL ADHERENCE TO THIS PRACTICE. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED FACTORS INFLUENCING ADHERENCE TO A 16-WEEK BIKRAM YOGA INTERVENTION IN STRESSED AND SEDENTARY ADULTS. METHODS: EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PARTICIPANTS (N = 29) WERE INSTRUCTED TO ATTEND 3-5 BIKRAM YOGA CLASSES WEEKLY FOR 16 WEEKS. BASELINE DEMOGRAPHICS, BEHAVIOURS AND HEALTH MEASURES WERE INVESTIGATED AS PREDICTORS OF ADHERENCE. BARRIERS WERE ASSESSED VIA DOCUMENTATION OF ADVERSE EVENTS, AND EXIT SURVEY RESPONSES. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS (38.2 +/- 10.1 YEARS) WERE PREDOMINANTLY OVERWEIGHT-OBESE (83%), FEMALE (79%), AND ATTENDED 27 +/- 18 CLASSES. HIGHER ADHERENCE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH OLDER AGE (P = 0.094), LESS PAIN (P = 0.011), FEWER PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS (P = 0.011), POORER BLOOD LIPID PROFILE, AND HIGHER HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV; TOTAL POWER, (P = 0.097)). IN MULTI-VARIABLE ANALYSIS, THREE VARIABLES: AGE (BETA = 0.492, P = 0.006), HRV (BETA = 0.413, P = 0.021) AND PAIN (BETA = 0.329, P = 0.048) REMAINED PREDICTORS OF ADHERENCE. DIFFICULTY COMMITTING TO THE TRIAL, LACK OF ENJOYMENT AND ADVERSE EVENTS WERE BARRIERS TO ADHERENCE. CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF FUTURE BIKRAM YOGA TRIALS TO FACILITATE HIGHER LEVELS OF ADHERENCE, WHICH MAY ENHANCE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND INFORM COMMUNITY PRACTICE. FUTURE TRIALS SHOULD INVESTIGATE AND ADDRESS ADDITIONAL BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS OF BIKRAM YOGA PRACTICE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
2  668  70 EFFECT OF A 16-WEEK BIKRAM YOGA PROGRAM ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY AND ASSOCIATED CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK FACTORS IN STRESSED AND SEDENTARY ADULTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC ACTIVATION OF THE STRESS-RESPONSE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK, PARTICULARLY IN SEDENTARY INDIVIDUALS. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECT OF A BIKRAM YOGA INTERVENTION ON THE HIGH FREQUENCY POWER COMPONENT OF HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) AND ASSOCIATED CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (CVD) RISK FACTORS (I.E. ADDITIONAL DOMAINS OF HRV, HEMODYNAMIC, HEMATOLOGIC, ANTHROPOMETRIC AND BODY COMPOSITION OUTCOME MEASURES) IN STRESSED AND SEDENTARY ADULTS. METHODS: ELIGIBLE ADULTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO AN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (N = 29) OR A NO TREATMENT CONTROL GROUP (N = 34). EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PARTICIPANTS WERE INSTRUCTED TO ATTEND THREE TO FIVE SUPERVISED BIKRAM YOGA CLASSES PER WEEK FOR 16 WEEKS AT LOCAL STUDIOS. OUTCOME MEASURES WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE (WEEK 0) AND COMPLETION (WEEK 17). RESULTS: SIXTY-THREE ADULTS (37.2 +/- 10.8 YEARS, 79% WOMEN) WERE INCLUDED IN THE INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP ATTENDED 27 +/- 18 CLASSES. ANALYSES OF COVARIANCE REVEALED NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE HIGH-FREQUENCY COMPONENT OF HRV (P = 0.912, PARTIAL ETA (2) = 0.000) OR IN ANY SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE BETWEEN GROUPS OVER TIME. HOWEVER, REGRESSION ANALYSES REVEALED THAT HIGHER ATTENDANCE IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (P = 0.039; PARTIAL ETA (2) = 0.154), BODY FAT PERCENTAGE (P = 0.001, PARTIAL ETA (2) = 0.379), FAT MASS (P = 0.003, PARTIAL ETA (2) = 0.294) AND BODY MASS INDEX (P = 0.05, PARTIAL ETA (2) = 0.139). CONCLUSIONS: A 16-WEEK BIKRAM YOGA PROGRAM DID NOT INCREASE THE HIGH FREQUENCY POWER COMPONENT OF HRV OR ANY OTHER CVD RISK FACTORS INVESTIGATED. AS REVEALED BY POST HOC ANALYSES, LOW ADHERENCE LIKELY CONTRIBUTED TO THE NULL EFFECTS. FUTURE STUDIES ARE REQUIRED TO ADDRESS BARRIERS TO ADHERENCE TO BETTER ELUCIDATE THE DOSE-RESPONSE EFFECTS OF BIKRAM YOGA PRACTICE AS A MEDIUM TO LOWER STRESS-RELATED CVD RISK.

3 1242  46 FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA INTERVENTION TO DECREASE PAIN IN OLDER WOMEN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF OLDER WOMEN SUFFER FROM CHRONIC PAIN, WHICH CAN DECREASE QUALITY OF LIFE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PILOT RANDOMIZED STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF A FLOW-RESTORATIVE YOGA INTERVENTION DESIGNED TO DECREASE PAIN AND RELATED OUTCOMES AMONG WOMEN AGED 60 OR OLDER. METHODS: FLOW-RESTORATIVE YOGA CLASSES WERE HELD TWICE WEEKLY FOR 1 HOUR AND LED BY A CERTIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTOR. PARTICIPANTS RANDOMIZED TO THE INTERVENTION GROUP ATTENDED THE YOGA CLASSES FOR 12 WEEKS AND RECEIVED SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS FOR AT-HOME PRACTICE. THOSE RANDOMIZED TO THE CONTROL GROUP WERE ASKED TO MAINTAIN THEIR NORMAL DAILY ROUTINE. FEASIBILITY WAS EVALUATED USING RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION RATES, CLASS AND HOME PRACTICE ADHERENCE RATES, AND PARTICIPANT SATISFACTION SURVEYS. OUTCOME MEASURES (SELF-REPORTED PAIN, INFLAMMATORY MARKERS, FUNCTIONAL FITNESS, QUALITY OF LIFE, RESILIENCE, AND SELF-REPORTED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY) WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION. PAIRED T-TESTS OR WILCOXON SIGNED-RANK TESTS WERE USED TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN OUTCOME MEASURES WITHIN TREATMENT GROUPS. RESULTS: THIRTY-EIGHT PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED. PARTICIPANTS WERE PRIMARILY WHITE, COLLEGE-EDUCATED, AND HIGHER FUNCTIONING, DESPITE EXPERIENCING VARIOUS FORMS OF CHRONIC PAIN. ATTENDANCE AND RETENTION RATES WERE HIGH (91 AND 97%, RESPECTIVELY) AND THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS WERE SATISFIED WITH THE YOGA PROGRAM (89%) AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS (87%). INTERVENTION PARTICIPANTS ALSO EXPERIENCED REDUCTIONS IN PAIN INTERFERENCE AND IMPROVEMENTS IN ENERGY AND SOCIAL FUNCTIONING. CONCLUSIONS: THIS PILOT STUDY PROVIDES ESSENTIAL DATA TO INFORM A FULL SCALE RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF FLOW-RESTORATIVE YOGA FOR OLDER WOMEN WITH CHRONIC PAIN. FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD EMPHASIZE STRATEGIES TO RECRUIT A MORE DIVERSE STUDY POPULATION, PARTICULARLY OLDER WOMEN AT HIGHER RISK OF DISABILITY AND FUNCTIONAL DECLINE.

4  936  33 EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA VERSUS EXERCISE FOR REDUCING FALLING RISK IN OLDER ADULTS: PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL INDICES. OUR PURPOSE IN THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA TO ADDRESS MULTIPLE RISK FACTORS OF FALLING IN ACTIVE AND LOW ACTIVE OLDER ADULTS. COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS (N = 35) OVER THE AGE OF 65 ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED IN EITHER A YOGA PROGRAM, AN EXERCISE PROGRAM, OR A NO-PROGRAM CONTROL. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED MEASURES ASSOCIATED WITH FALLING RISKS. PHYSICAL MEASURES INCLUDED LOWER BODY STRENGTH, STATIC BALANCE, AND LOWER BODY FLEXIBILITY. PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASURES INCLUDED PERCEIVED SELF-EFFICACY WITH RESPECT TO FALLS AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE. WE DETERMINED BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCES USING PLANNED COMPARISONS, EFFECT SIZE, CONFIDENCE INTERVALS, AND PROBABILITY OF SUPERIORITY. RESULTS OF PLANNED COMPARISONS AND PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE TESTING INDICATED THAT YOGA PARTICIPANTS SCORED HIGHER THAN THE EXERCISE AND CONTROL PARTICIPANTS ON BOTH RIGHT AND LEFT LOWER BODY FLEXIBILITY TESTS. YOGA PARTICIPANTS ALSO SCORED HIGHER THAN THE CONTROL PARTICIPANTS ON RIGHT LEG STATIC BALANCE, AND THE RIGHT AND LEFT LOWER BODY FLEXIBILITY TESTS. THE EXERCISE PARTICIPANTS SCORED HIGHER THAN YOGA PARTICIPANTS ON THE RAND-36 QUALITY OF LIFE SUBSCALES OF ENERGY/FATIGUE, PAIN, AND GENERAL HEALTH. THE PROBABILITY OF SUPERIORITY RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE NO-PROGRAM OLDER ADULT PARTICIPANTS WOULD BENEFIT BY ENROLLING IN THE YOGA RATHER THAN THE EXERCISE PROGRAM TO REDUCE PHYSICAL RISKS OF FALLING. THESE FINDINGS WERE DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO PROMOTING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PROGRAMS TO REDUCE RISKS OF FALLING, AND THE ROLES OF THE PROTOCOL, PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE, AND MEASURES EMPLOYED WHEN DETERMINING PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
5  279  40 ADHERENCE AND RETENTION OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH A YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION: THE EFFECTS OF HEALTH PROMOTING PROGRAMS ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK STUDY. OBJECTIVES: SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE IS A RISK FACTOR FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (CVD). FEW ALTERNATIVE LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS YOGA PRACTICE, FOCUS ON AFRICAN AMERICANS (AA), THE POPULATION MOST VULNERABLE TO CVD. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO COMPARE THE RETENTION AND ADHERENCE RATES BETWEEN YOGA, WALKING, AND HEALTH EDUCATION INTERVENTIONS WHILE PROVIDING INFORMATION ABOUT THE ACCEPTANCE OF VARIOUS YOGA REGIMENS. DESIGN: THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY-FIVE AA PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED EXCLUSIVELY FROM AN ACTIVE COHORT STUDY AND RANDOMIZED INTO A 48-WEEK STUDY (24 WEEKS INTERVENTION, 24 WEEKS FOLLOW-UP) WITH 5 HEALTH PROMOTION INTERVENTIONS: HIGH FREQUENCY YOGA, MODERATE FREQUENCY YOGA, LOW FREQUENCY YOGA, GUIDED WALKING, AND HEALTH EDUCATION. IN ADDITION TO EXAMINING THE SEPARATE YOGA INTERVENTIONS, A POOLED YOGA INTERVENTION IS CONSIDERED FOR COMPARISON TO GUIDED WALKING AND HEALTH EDUCATION. PARTICIPANT RETENTION, ADHERENCE, AND VITALS WERE MONITORED AT EACH INTERVENTION SESSION. PARTICIPANTS WERE ALSO SCHEDULED FOR FOUR CLINIC VISITS THROUGHOUT THE STUDY WHERE BLOOD PANELS, HEALTH BEHAVIOR, AND MEDICATION SURVEYS WERE ADMINISTERED. RESULTS: OF THE 375 PARTICIPANTS RECRUITED, 31.7% DID NOT COMPLETE THE STUDY. AT BASELINE, IN BOTH THE GUIDED WALKING GROUP AND THE HIGH FREQUENCY YOGA GROUP, THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THOSE WHO COMPLETED THE STUDY AND THOSE WHO DID NOT. ALTHOUGH INTERVENTION RETENTION IN THE POOLED YOGA PROGRAM (78.3%) WAS HIGHER COMPARED TO THE WALKING (60%) AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS (74.3%) (P = 0.007), DIFFERENCES IN POST-INTERVENTION RETENTION WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT. MEDIAN ADHERENCE RATES FOR THE POOLED YOGA PROGRAM EXCEEDED RATES FOR GUIDED WALKING AND EDUCATION WITH MODERATE FREQUENCY YOGA OUT PERFORMING HIGH AND LOW FREQUENCY YOGA. CONCLUSION: STUDY-DEFINED RETENTION SUCCESS RATES WERE NOT REACHED BY ALL HEALTH PROMOTION PROGRAMS. HOWEVER, RETENTION AND ADHERENCE RATES FOR THE POOLED YOGA PROGRAM SHOW THAT OLDER AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE RECEPTIVE TO PARTICIPATING IN YOGA-BASED HEALTH PROMOTION PRACTICES.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
6 1707  35 PATTERNS OF YOGA PRACTICE AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOLLOWING A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR ADULTS WITH OR AT RISK FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES. BACKGROUND: THE CURRENT STUDY DESCRIBED PATTERNS OF YOGA PRACTICE AND EXAMINED DIFFERENCES IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OVER TIME BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS WITH OR AT RISK FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES WHO COMPLETED AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION COMPARED WITH CONTROLS. METHODS: A LONGITUDINAL COMPARATIVE DESIGN MEASURED THE EFFECT OF A YOGA INTERVENTION ON YOGA PRACTICE AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, USING DATA AT BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION MONTHS 3, 6, AND 15. RESULTS: DISPARATE PATTERNS OF YOGA PRACTICE OCCURRED BETWEEN INTERVENTION AND CONTROL PARTICIPANTS OVER TIME, BUT THE SUBJECTIVE DEFINITION OF YOGA PRACTICE LIMITS INTERPRETATION. MULTILEVEL MODEL ESTIMATES INDICATED THAT TREATMENT GROUP DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE IN THE RATE OF CHANGE IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OVER THE STUDY PERIOD. WHILE AGE AND EDUCATION WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT INDIVIDUAL PREDICTORS, THE INCLUSION OF THESE VARIABLES IN THE MODEL DID IMPROVE FIT. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS INDICATE THAT AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OVER TIME. FURTHER RESEARCH IS NECESSARY TO EXPLORE THE INFLUENCE OF YOGA ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OUTCOMES AMONG INDIVIDUALS WITH OR AT RISK FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
7 2613  35 YOGA FOR RISK REDUCTION OF METABOLIC SYNDROME: PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES FROM A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY. LIFESTYLE CHANGE IS RECOMMENDED AS TREATMENT FOR ADULTS AT RISK FOR METABOLIC SYNDROME (METS), ALTHOUGH ADOPTION OF NEW BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS IS LIMITED. IN ADDITION, MOST EXISTING LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS DO NOT ADDRESS PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS OR QUALITY OF LIFE, BOTH OF WHICH IMPACT THE BURDEN OF METS. YOGA, A FORM OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THAT INCORPORATES PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPONENTS (E.G., MAINTAINING ATTENTION, RELAXATION), IS A PROMISING INTERVENTION FOR IMPROVING THE BURDEN OF METS. THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL ASSESSED THE FEASIBILITY AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF A 12-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM COUPLED WITH AN EVIDENCE-BASED HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAM (HED) COMPARED TO HED ALONE. A SECONDARY, EXPLORATORY AIM EXAMINED PERCEIVED STRESS, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND RELATED PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES (MINDFULNESS, PERCEIVED HEALTH COMPETENCE, AND MOOD). SIXTY-SEVEN ADULTS AT RISK FOR METS ENROLLED (MEAN AGE [SD]: 58 [10] YEARS; 50% MALE; 79% NON-HISPANIC WHITE). PRELIMINARY RESULTS REVEALED SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER IMPROVEMENTS IN TWO QUALITY OF LIFE DOMAINS (ROLE-PHYSICAL AND GENERAL HEALTH PERCEPTIONS) IN THE HED PLUS YOGA GROUP VERSUS HED ALONE (PS < 0.05). THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY THAT IMPLEMENTED LIFESTYLE EDUCATION ALONG WITH YOGA TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL UNIQUE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PARTICIPANTS AT RISK FOR METS. A LARGER CLINICAL TRIAL IS WARRANTED TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE THESE PROMISING PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
8  669  48 EFFECT OF A 16-WEEK BIKRAM YOGA PROGRAM ON PERCEIVED STRESS, SELF-EFFICACY AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN STRESSED AND SEDENTARY ADULTS: A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF 16 WEEKS OF BIKRAM YOGA ON PERCEIVED STRESS, SELF-EFFICACY AND HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) IN SEDENTARY, STRESSED ADULTS. DESIGN: 16 WEEK, PARALLEL-ARM, RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH FLEXIBLE DOSING. METHODS: PHYSICALLY INACTIVE, STRESSED ADULTS (37.2+/-10.8 YEARS) WERE RANDOMISED TO BIKRAM YOGA (THREE TO FIVE CLASSES PER WEEK) OR CONTROL (NO TREATMENT) GROUP FOR 16 WEEKS. OUTCOME MEASURES, COLLECTED VIA SELF-REPORT, INCLUDED PERCEIVED STRESS, GENERAL SELF-EFFICACY, AND HRQOL. OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE, MIDPOINT AND COMPLETION. RESULTS: INDIVIDUALS WERE RANDOMISED TO THE EXPERIMENTAL (N=29) OR CONTROL GROUP (N=34). AVERAGE ATTENDANCE IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS 27+/-18 CLASSES. REPEATED MEASURE ANALYSES OF VARIANCE (INTENTION-TO-TREAT) DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED PERCEIVED STRESS (P=0.003, PARTIAL ETA(2)=0.109), GENERAL SELF-EFFICACY (P=0.034, PARTIAL ETA(2)=0.056), AND THE GENERAL HEALTH (P=0.034, PARTIAL ETA(2)=0.058) AND ENERGY/FATIGUE (P=0.019, PARTIAL ETA(2)=0.066) DOMAINS OF HRQOL IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP VERSUS THE CONTROL GROUP. ATTENDANCE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCTIONS IN PERCEIVED STRESS, AND AN INCREASE IN SEVERAL DOMAINS OF HRQOL. CONCLUSIONS: 16 WEEKS OF BIKRAM YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED PERCEIVED STRESS, GENERAL SELF-EFFICACY AND HRQOL IN SEDENTARY, STRESSED ADULTS. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD CONSIDER WAYS TO OPTIMISE ADHERENCE, AND SHOULD INVESTIGATE EFFECTS OF BIKRAM YOGA INTERVENTION IN OTHER POPULATIONS AT RISK FOR STRESS-RELATED ILLNESS.

9 2183  46 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PSYCHOSOCIAL VARIABLES AND EXERCISE ADHERENCE: A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: PHYSICAL INACTIVITY IS A SERIOUS ISSUE FOR THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. BECAUSE OF CONDITIONS THAT RESULT FROM INACTIVITY, INDIVIDUALS INCUR CLOSE TO $1 TRILLION USD IN HEALTH-CARE COSTS, AND APPROXIMATELY 250 000 PREMATURE DEATHS OCCUR PER YEAR. RESEARCHERS HAVE LINKED ENGAGING IN YOGA TO IMPROVED OVERALL FITNESS, INCLUDING IMPROVED MUSCULAR STRENGTH, MUSCULAR ENDURANCE, FLEXIBILITY, AND BALANCE. RESEARCHERS HAVE NOT YET INVESTIGATED THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON EXERCISE ADHERENCE. OBJECTIVE: THE RESEARCH TEAM ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF 10 WEEKS OF YOGA CLASSES HELD TWICE A WEEK ON EXERCISE ADHERENCE IN PREVIOUSLY SEDENTARY ADULTS. DESIGN: THE RESEARCH TEAM DESIGNED A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT TRIAL. THE TEAM COLLECTED DATA FROM THE INTERVENTION (YOGA) AND CONTROL GROUPS AT BASELINE, MIDPOINT, AND POSTTEST (POSTTEST 1) AND ALSO COLLECTED DATA PERTAINING TO EXERCISE ADHERENCE FOR THE YOGA GROUP AT 5 WEEKS POSTTEST (POSTTEST 2). SETTING: THE PILOT TOOK PLACE IN A YOGA STUDIO IN CENTRAL NEW JERSEY IN THE UNITED STATES. THE PRETESTING OCCURRED AT THE YOGA STUDIO FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS. MIDPOINT TESTING AND POSTTESTING OCCURRED AT THE STUDIO FOR THE YOGA GROUP AND BY MAIL FOR THE CONTROL GROUP. PARTICIPANTS: PARTICIPANTS WERE 27 ADULTS (MEAN AGE 51 Y) WHO HAD BEEN PHYSICALLY INACTIVE FOR A PERIOD OF AT LEAST 6 MONTHS PRIOR TO THE STUDY. INTERVENTIONS THE INTERVENTION GROUP (YOGA GROUP) RECEIVED HOUR-LONG HATHA YOGA CLASSES THAT MET TWICE A WEEK FOR 10 WEEKS. THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN CLASSES DURING THE RESEARCH STUDY; HOWEVER, THEY WERE OFFERED COMPLIMENTARY POST RESEARCH CLASSES. OUTCOME MEASURES THE STUDY'S PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS EXERCISE ADHERENCE AS MEASURED BY THE 7-DAY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY RECALL. THE SECONDARY MEASURES INCLUDED (1) EXERCISE SELF-EFFICACY AS MEASURED BY THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL SELF-EFFICACY FOR EXERCISE SCALE, (2) GENERAL WELL-BEING AS MEASURED BY THE GENERAL WELL-BEING SCHEDULE, (3) EXERCISE-GROUP COHESION AS MEASURED BY THE GROUP ENVIRONMENT QUESTIONNAIRE (GEQ), (4) ACUTE FEELING RESPONSE AS MEASURED BY THE EXERCISE-INDUCED FEELING INVENTORY (EFI), AND (5) TWO OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS CODED FOR EMERGING THEMES AND SUBCATEGORIES. RESULTS: THE ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE YOGA GROUP'S MEAN HOURS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AT 10 WEEKS REFLECTED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN EXERCISE ADHERENCE FROM BASELINE (P < .012) AND A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE FROM THE CONTROL GROUP (P < .004). AT 5 WEEKS POST-INTERVENTION, NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE HAD OCCURRED IN THE YOGA GROUP'S EXERCISE ADHERENCE (P = .906). EXERCISE SELF-EFFICACY CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM BASELINE TO MIDPOINT (P < .029). THE GENERAL WELLBEING DATA DEMONSTRATED A SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION EFFECT (P < .001), RESULTING FROM AN INCREASE IN GENERAL WELL-BEING IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP AND A DECREASE IN GENERAL WELL-BEING IN THE CONTROL GROUP. IN ADDITION, THE YOGA GROUP'S COHESION SCORE WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE NORMS ON TWO CONSTRUCTS OF THE GEQ: ATTRACTION TO GROUP TASK AND GROUP INTEGRATION TASK. THE EFI REVEALED THAT THE YOGA PARTICIPANTS "FELT STRONGLY" THAT THEIR EXPERIENCES IN YOGA WERE PEACEFUL, HAPPY, UPBEAT, AND ENTHUSIASTIC AND THAT THEY FELT REVIVED FOLLOWING THE YOGA CLASSES. QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF DATA REVEALED SELF-REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN EXERCISE BEHAVIORS, STRESS MANAGEMENT, AND EATING HABITS. CONCLUSIONS: TEN WEEKS OF YOGA CLASSES TWICE A WEEK SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED PREVIOUSLY INACTIVE PARTICIPANTS' ADHERENCE TO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. ADDITIONALLY, THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT A MIND-BODY EXERCISE PROGRAM MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION IN THE FIGHT AGAINST PHYSICAL INACTIVITY.	2012	

10  281  34 ADHERENCE TO AND CHANGES IN MENTAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL HEALTH DURING AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: PARTICIPATING IN YOGA MAY BE IDEAL FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS TO INCREASE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH. PURPOSE: TO INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY AND IMPACT OF AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION WITHIN A UNIVERSITY SETTING ON MENTAL AND PHYSIOLOGIC HEATH. METHODS: THIS 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION INCLUDED TWELVE YOGA-NAIVE ADULTS, (23.8 +/- 4.6 YEARS; 71% FEMALE). PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED TWO 60-MIN YOGA CLASSES/WEEK IN ADDITION TO BASELINE, MID- AND POST-LAB VISITS. RESULTS: 83% OF PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED >/=75% OF YOGA CLASSES. STRESS AND DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS DECREASED BY 11% AND 25%, RESPECTIVELY AND ERYTHROCYTE SEDIMENTATION RATE (ESR) REDUCED BY 28%. PARTICIPANTS WHO DID NOT MEET PHYSICAL ACTIVITY RECOMMENDATIONS OBSERVED GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN STRESS, DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS, ESR, AND C-REACTIVE PROTEIN COMPARED TO PARTICIPANTS WHO MET RECOMMENDATIONS. CONCLUSION: THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED >/=12 OF 16 YOGA CLASSES. EXPLORATORY ANALYSES PROVIDE PRELIMINARY SUPPORT FOR THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON REDUCING STRESS, SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION, AND ESR. PARTICIPANTS WHO WERE NOT MEETING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY GUIDELINES PRIOR TO STARTING THE INTERVENTION RECEIVED GREATER BENEFITS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
11 2187  40 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH: A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: UNIVERSITIES AROUND THE WORLD ARE FACING AN EPIDEMIC OF MENTAL DISTRESS AMONG THEIR STUDENTS. THE PROBLEM IS TRULY A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE, AFFECTING MANY AND WITH SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES. THE GLOBAL BURDEN OF DISEASE-AGENDA CALLS FOR EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS WITH LASTING EFFECTS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE MENTAL HEALTH OF YOUNG ADULTS. IN THIS STUDY WE AIMED TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOGA, A POPULAR AND WIDELY AVAILABLE MIND-BODY PRACTICE, CAN IMPROVE STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH. METHODS: WE PERFORMED A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH 202 HEALTHY UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN THE OSLO AREA. THE PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSIGNED TO A YOGA GROUP OR WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP IN A 1:1 RATIO BY A SIMPLE ONLINE RANDOMISATION PROGRAM. THE INTERVENTION GROUP WAS OFFERED 24 YOGA SESSIONS OVER 12 WEEKS. MEASUREMENTS WERE TAKEN AT WEEK 0 (BASELINE), WEEK 12 (POST-INTERVENTION), AND WEEK 24 (FOLLOW-UP). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS ASSESSED BY THE HSCL-25 QUESTIONNAIRE. ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED BASED ON THE INTENTION TO TREAT-PRINCIPLE. RESULTS: BETWEEN 24 JANUARY 2017, AND 27 AUGUST 2017, WE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED 202 STUDENTS TO A YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 100), OR WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 102). COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP, THE YOGA PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DISTRESS SYMPTOMS BOTH AT POST-INTERVENTION (ADJUSTED DIFFERENCE IN THE MEAN CHANGE -0.15, 95% CI -0.26 TO -0.03, P = 0.0110) AND FOLLOW-UP (ADJUSTED DIFFERENCE IN THE MEAN CHANGE -0.18, 95% CI -0.29 TO -0.06, P = 0.0025). SLEEP QUALITY ALSO IMPROVED AT POST-INTERVENTION AND FOLLOW-UP. NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS: OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA HAS A MODERATELY LARGE AND LASTING EFFECT, AT LEAST FOR SOME MONTHS, REDUCING SYMPTOMS OF DISTRESS AND IMPROVING SLEEP QUALITY AMONG STUDENTS. FURTHER RESEARCH SHOULD SEEK WAYS TO ENHANCE THE EFFECT, ASSESS AN EVEN LONGER FOLLOW-UP PERIOD, INCLUDE ACTIVE CONTROL GROUPS, AND CONSIDER PERFORMING SIMILAR STUDIES IN OTHER CULTURAL SETTINGS.TRIAL REGISTRATION: CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT04258540.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
12 1902  43 RESTORATIVE YOGA IN ADULTS WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME: A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED PILOT TRIAL. BACKGROUND: METABOLIC SYNDROME INCREASES THE RISK OF DIABETES AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. YOGA IMPROVES SOME METABOLIC PARAMETERS, BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED IN PERSONS WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME. WE CONDUCTED A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT TRIAL TO DETERMINE WHETHER A RESTORATIVE YOGA INTERVENTION WAS FEASIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE IN UNDERACTIVE, OVERWEIGHT ADULTS WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME. METHODS: TWENTY SIX UNDERACTIVE, OVERWEIGHT ADULT MEN AND WOMEN WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME WERE RANDOMIZED TO ATTEND 15 YOGA SESSIONS OF 90 MINUTES EACH OVER 10 WEEKS OR TO A WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP. FEASIBILITY WAS MEASURED BY RECRUITMENT RATES, SUBJECT RETENTION, AND ADHERENCE. ACCEPTABILITY WAS ASSESSED BY INTERVIEW AND QUESTIONNAIRES. CHANGES IN METABOLIC OUTCOMES AND QUESTIONNAIRE MEASURES FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 10 WERE CALCULATED. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 280 PEOPLE WERE SCREENED BY PHONE, AND 93 WITH HIGH LIKELIHOOD OF METABOLIC SYNDROME WERE INVITED TO A SCREENING VISIT. OF THE 68 WHO ATTENDED SCREENING VISITS, 26 (38%) WERE RANDOMIZED, AND 24 (92%) COMPLETED THE TRIAL. ATTENDANCE AT YOGA CLASSES AND ADHERENCE TO HOME PRACTICE EXCEEDED OUR GOALS. IN THE YOGA GROUP, ALL PARTICIPANTS GAVE THE STUDY THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE SATISFACTION RATING, AND THE MAJORITY (87%) FELT THAT THE YOGA POSES WERE EASY TO PERFORM. THERE WAS TREND TO REDUCED BLOOD PRESSURE (P = 0.07), A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN ENERGY LEVEL (P < 0.009), AND TRENDS TO IMPROVEMENT IN WELL-BEING (P < 0.12) AND STRESS (P < 0.22) IN THE YOGA VERSUS CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: RESTORATIVE YOGA WAS A FEASIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE INTERVENTION IN OVERWEIGHT ADULTS WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME. THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR IMPROVING METABOLIC PARAMETERS IN THIS POPULATION SHOULD BE EXPLORED IN A LARGER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
13 2840  32 YOGA, AS A TRANSITIONAL PLATFORM TO MORE ACTIVE LIFESTYLE: A 6-MONTH PILOT STUDY IN THE USA. A 6-MONTH PILOT STUDY EXPLORED THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA PROGRAM ON THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (PA) LEVEL OF OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE SEDENTARY ADULTS. FOURTEEN COMMUNITY-DWELLING OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE SEDENTARY ADULTS PARTICIPATED IN A 6-MONTH PROGRAM (2-MONTH YOGA PROGRAM AND 4-MONTH FOLLOW-UP) DELIVERED BY TWO TYPES OF INSTRUCTION [THE DIRECT GUIDANCE OF AN INSTRUCTOR (FACE-TO-FACE GROUP) VS. THE SELF-LEARNING METHOD OF USING A DVD (DVD GROUP)]. MEASUREMENTS INCLUDED PROGRAM ADHERENCE (CLASS ATTENDANCE AND HOME PRACTICE; MIN/WEEK) AND LEVEL OF PA [METABOLIC EQUIVALENT (MET)-HOUR/WEEK] AT BASELINE, 2, 4 AND 6 MONTHS. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS AND NONPARAMETRIC TESTS WERE USED TO DESCRIBE THE SAMPLE AND EXAMINE DIFFERENCES BY GROUP AND TIME. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES BY GROUP ASSIGNED. PARTICIPANTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT PA CHANGES FROM BASELINE TO EACH MEASUREMENT POINT. THE DIRECT GUIDANCE OF AN INSTRUCTOR WAS PREFERRED OVER THE SELF-LEARNING METHOD. AT EACH TIME INTERVAL, THE DVD GROUP SHOWED HIGHER LEVELS OF PA THAN THE FACE-TO-FACE GROUP; THE ONLY DIFFERENCE THAT ACHIEVED STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE OCCURRED AT 4 MONTHS. THE PA LEVEL SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED OVER 6 MONTHS IN THE DVD GROUP, BUT NOT IN THE FACE-TO-FACE GROUP. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT A YOGA PROGRAM MAY BE UTILIZED AS A 'STEPPING-STONE' TOWARD REGULAR EXERCISE AMONG OVERWEIGHT SEDENTARY ADULTS. RESEARCH WITH A LARGER SAMPLE IS NEEDED TO FURTHER EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF THE PROGRAM ON THE LEVEL OF PA AMONG THIS POPULATION.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
14 2837  37 YOGA'S IMPACT ON RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS FOR DISORDERED EATING: A PILOT PREVENTION TRIAL. YOGA HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS A STRATEGY FOR IMPROVING RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS FOR EATING DISORDERS, BUT FEW PREVENTION TRIALS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF A YOGA SERIES IN FEMALE COLLEGE STUDENTS (N = 52). PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO A YOGA INTERVENTION (THREE 50-MINUTE YOGA CLASSES/WEEK FOR 10 WEEKS CONDUCTED BY CERTIFIED YOGA TEACHERS WHO RECEIVED A 3-DAY INTENSIVE TRAINING) OR A CONTROL GROUP. RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS, ASSESSED AT BASELINE, 5 AND 10 WEEKS, INCLUDED BODY DISSATISFACTION, NEGATIVE AFFECT, LONELINESS, SELF-COMPASSION, POSITIVE AFFECT, AND MINDFULNESS. MIXED MODELS CONTROLLING FOR BASELINE LEVELS OF OUTCOME VARIABLES WERE RUN. ON AVERAGE, PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED 20 OUT OF 30 YOGA CLASSES, AND THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS REPORTED HIGH LEVELS OF SATISFACTION WITH THE YOGA SERIES. APPEARANCE ORIENTATION DECREASED AND POSITIVE AFFECT INCREASED IN THE YOGA GROUP RELATIVE TO THE CONTROL GROUP. AFTER CONTROLLING FOR BASELINE LEVELS, THE YOGA GROUP HAD A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER POSITIVE AFFECT THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. CHANGES IN OTHER OUTCOMES WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT, AS COMPARED TO THE CONTROL CONDITION. FUTURE YOGA RESEARCH DIRECTIONS ARE DISCUSSED INCLUDING EDUCATION ABOUT BODY IMAGE, MEASURE AND SAMPLE SELECTION, AND USE OF AN IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE FRAMEWORK.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
15  636  33 DISTRESS TOLERANCE AS A PREDICTOR OF ADHERENCE TO A YOGA INTERVENTION: MODERATING ROLES OF BMI AND BODY IMAGE. THIS STUDY TESTED WHETHER DISTRESS TOLERANCE, BODY IMAGE, AND BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) PREDICTED ADHERENCE TO A YOGA INTERVENTION. PARTICIPANTS WERE 27 WOMEN WHO PARTICIPATED IN A YOGA INTERVENTION AS PART OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. ATTENDANCE AND DISTRESS TOLERANCE WERE ASSESSED WEEKLY, AND BODY IMAGE AND BMI WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE. MULTILEVEL MODELING REVEALED A THREE-WAY INTERACTION OF DISTRESS TOLERANCE, BMI, AND BODY IMAGE (P < .001). FOR PARTICIPANTS WITH FEW BODY IMAGE CONCERNS, DISTRESS TOLERANCE WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH ADHERENCE REGARDLESS OF BMI (P = .009). HOWEVER, FOR THOSE WITH POOR BODY IMAGE, INCREASES IN DISTRESS TOLERANCE WERE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASES IN ADHERENCE AMONG OVERWEIGHT PARTICIPANTS (P < .001) BUT LOWER ADHERENCE AMONG OBESE PARTICIPANTS (P = .007). DISTRESS TOLERANCE MAY BE IMPLICATED IN ADHERENCE TO A YOGA INTERVENTION, ALTHOUGH ITS EFFECTS MAY BE DEPENDENT ON BODY IMAGE CONCERNS, BMI, AND THEIR INTERACTION. RESEARCH AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
16  342  24 ASHTANGA YOGA FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS FOR WEIGHT MANAGEMENT AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL BEING: AN UNCONTROLLED OPEN PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON WEIGHT IN YOUTH AT RISK FOR DEVELOPING TYPE 2 DIABETES. SECONDARILY, THE IMPACT OF PARTICIPATION IN YOGA ON SELF-CONCEPT AND PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS WAS MEASURED. METHODS: A 12-WEEK PROSPECTIVE PILOT ASHTANGA YOGA PROGRAM ENROLLED TWENTY CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS. WEIGHT WAS MEASURED BEFORE AND AFTER THE PROGRAM. ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED SELF-CONCEPT, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION INVENTORIES AT THE INITIATION AND COMPLETION OF THE PROGRAM. RESULTS: FOURTEEN PREDOMINATELY HISPANIC CHILDREN, AGES 8-15, COMPLETED THE PROGRAM. THE AVERAGE WEIGHT LOSS WAS 2KG. WEIGHT DECREASED FROM 61.2+/-20.2KG TO 59.2+/-19.2KG (P=0.01). FOUR OF FIVE CHILDREN WITH LOW SELF-ESTEEM IMPROVED, ALTHOUGH TWO HAD DECREASES IN SELF-ESTEEM. ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IMPROVED IN THE STUDY. CONCLUSION: ASHTANGA YOGA MAY BE BENEFICIAL AS A WEIGHT LOSS STRATEGY IN A PREDOMINATELY HISPANIC POPULATION.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
17 1788  38 PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE THAT YOGA PRACTICE PROGRESSIVELY IMPROVES MOOD AND DECREASES STRESS IN A SAMPLE OF UK PRISONERS. OBJECTIVES. IN THE FIRST RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA ON UK PRISONERS, WE PREVIOUSLY SHOWED THAT YOGA PRACTICE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED MENTAL WELLBEING AND COGNITION. HERE, WE AIMED TO ASSESS HOW CLASS ATTENDANCE, SELF-PRACTICE, AND DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS WERE RELATED TO OUTCOME AMONGST PRISONERS ENROLLED IN THE 10-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. METHODS. THE DATA OF 55 PARTICIPANTS (52 MALE, 3 FEMALE) WHO COMPLETED A 10-WEEK YOGA COURSE WERE ANALYSED. CHANGES IN PRE- AND POSTYOGA MEASURES OF AFFECT, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS WERE ENTERED INTO LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSES WITH BIAS-CORRECTED AND ACCELERATED BOOTSTRAP CONFIDENCE INTERVALS. CLASS ATTENDANCE, SELF-PRACTICE, DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES, AND BASELINE PSYCHOMETRIC VARIABLES WERE INCLUDED AS REGRESSORS. RESULTS. PARTICIPANTS WHO ATTENDED MORE YOGA CLASSES AND THOSE WHO ENGAGED IN FREQUENT (5 TIMES OR MORE) SELF-PRACTICE REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER DECREASES IN PERCEIVED STRESS. DECREASES IN NEGATIVE AFFECT WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO HIGH FREQUENCY SELF-PRACTICE AND GREATER CLASS ATTENDANCE AT A NEAR-SIGNIFICANT LEVEL. AGE WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH YOGA CLASS ATTENDANCE, AND HIGHER LEVELS OF EDUCATION WERE ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER DECREASES IN NEGATIVE AFFECT. CONCLUSIONS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THERE MAY BE PROGRESSIVE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA WITHIN PRISON POPULATIONS AND POINT TO SUBPOPULATIONS WHO MAY BENEFIT THE MOST FROM THIS PRACTICE.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
18 1839  23 PSYCHOSOCIAL CORRELATES AND OUTCOMES OF YOGA OR WALKING AMONG OLDER ADULTS. FEW RESEARCHERS HAVE COMPARED PSYCHOLOGICAL CORRELATES AND OUTCOMES OF YOGA WITH MORE TRADITIONAL FORMS OF EXERCISE. THE AUTHORS' PRIMARY AIM WAS TO COMPARE CHANGES IN THE PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES OF MOOD AND STATE ANXIETY PRODUCED BY AN ACUTE BOUT OF YOGA OR WALKING AMONG OLDER ADULTS. THE SECONDARY AIM WAS TO COMPARE SELECTED PSYCHOSOCIAL CORRELATES OF ACTIVITY. PARTICIPANTS WERE 51 ADULTS WHO WERE 50 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER WHO WALKED FOR EXERCISE OR PARTICIPATED IN A YOGA CLASS. RESULTS REVEALED THAT YOGA PARTICIPANTS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER LEVELS OF DEPRESSION AND PERCEIVED BARRIERS TO EXERCISE, AND LOWER QUALITY OF LIFE THAN DID WALKERS. WITH CONTROL FOR THESE DIFFERENCES, YOGA PRACTITIONERS HAD IMPROVED LEVELS OF FATIGUE PRE- TO POSTSESSION, COMPARED WITH WALKERS. WITH CONTROL FOR DIFFERENCES IN DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES, THESE CHANGES WERE NO LONGER SIGNIFICANT. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT YOGA PRACTITIONERS SEEK OUT MINDFUL-BASED EXERCISE TO COPE WITH GREATER LEVELS OF DEPRESSION AND LOWER LEVELS OF QUALITY OF LIFE.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
19 2217  36 THE IMPACT OF A SHORT-TERM IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM ON THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF PHYSICALLY INACTIVE OLDER ADULTS. BACKGROUND: WITH THE CURRENT CHALLENGE OF RAPIDLY AGING POPULATIONS, PRACTICES SUCH AS YOGA MAY HELP OLDER ADULTS STAY PHYSICALLY ACTIVE, HEALTHY, AND FULFILLED. METHODS: THE IMPACT OF AN 8-WEEK IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM ON THE HOLISTIC HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF PHYSICALLY INACTIVE PEOPLE AGED 55 YEARS AND OVER WAS ASSESSED. THIRTY-EIGHT OLDER ADULTS (MEAN AGE 73.21+/-8.38 YEARS; 19 INTERVENTION, 19 CONTROL) ENGAGED IN EITHER TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES OR CONTINUED THEIR USUAL DAILY ROUTINES. PHYSICAL HEALTH MEASURES WERE MUSCLE STRENGTH, ACTIVE RANGE OF MOTION, RESPIRATORY FUNCTION (FEV1), RESTING BLOOD PRESSURE, AND IMMUNE FUNCTION (SALIVARY IGA AND LYSOZYME). SELF-PERCEIVED GENERAL, PHYSICAL, MENTAL, SPIRITUAL, AND SOCIAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING WERE ASSESSED WITH THE LIFE'S ODYSSEY QUESTIONNAIRE AND THE SF12V2 HEALTH SURVEY. RESULTS: MUSCLE STRENGTH, ACTIVE RANGE OF MOTION, PHYSICAL WELL-BEING, AND ASPECTS OF MENTAL WELL-BEING (EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING AND SELF-CARE) IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE YOGA GROUP (P<.05). MEDIAN CHANGES IN MOST OF THESE VARIABLES WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE IN THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: PARTICIPATION IN IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAMS BY OLDER PEOPLE IS BENEFICIAL FOR HEALTH AND WELL-BEING, AND GREATER AVAILABILITY OF SUCH PROGRAMS COULD IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
20  719  35 EFFECT OF IYENGAR YOGA ON MENTAL HEALTH OF INCARCERATED WOMEN: A FEASIBILITY STUDY. BACKGROUND: INCARCERATED WOMEN SHARE A DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN OF MENTAL ILLNESS. ALTHOUGH PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO WOMEN IN PRISON, ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT MODALITIES, SUCH AS IYENGAR YOGA, MAY INCREASE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING. OBJECTIVES: THE PURPOSES OF THIS STUDY WERE (A) TO ADDRESS THE FEASIBILITY OF PROVIDING A GENDER-RESPONSIVE EXERCISE INTERVENTION WITHIN A CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION AND (B) TO OBSERVE THE EFFECT OF A GROUP-FORMAT IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM THAT MET TWO SESSIONS A WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS ON LEVELS OF DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS, ANXIETY SYMPTOMS, AND PERCEIVED STRESS AMONG INCARCERATED WOMEN. METHODS: A REPEATED MEASURES DESIGN, IN WHICH EACH PARTICIPANT SERVED AS HER OWN CONTROL, WAS USED. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THREE SELF-ADMINISTERED INSTRUMENTS: THE BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY, THE BECK ANXIETY INVENTORY, AND THE PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE BEFORE TREATMENT (BASELINE) AND DURING TREATMENT (WEEKS 4, 8, AND 12). LINEAR MIXED EFFECTS MODELS WERE USED TO EXAMINE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN MENTAL HEALTH MEASURES OVER TIME, TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ALL AVAILABLE DATA. RESULTS: ALTHOUGH 21 WOMEN INITIALLY PARTICIPATED IN THE INTERVENTION, 6 WOMEN COMPLETED THE 12-WEEK INTERVENTION. A SIGNIFICANT LINEAR DECREASE WAS DEMONSTRATED IN SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION OVER TIME, WITH MEAN VALUES CHANGING FROM 24.90 AT BASELINE TO 5.67 AT WEEK 12. THERE WAS A MARGINALLY SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN ANXIETY OVER TIME (12.00 AT BASELINE TO 7.33 AT WEEK 12) AND A NONLINEAR CHANGE IN STRESS OVER TIME, WITH DECREASES FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 4 AND SUBSEQUENT INCREASES TO WEEK 12. DISCUSSION: WOMEN WHO PARTICIPATED IN THIS PROGRAM EXPERIENCED FEWER SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY OVER TIME. FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY MAY BE USED TO IMPROVE FUTURE INTERVENTIONS FOCUSING ON THE HEALTH OUTCOMES OF INCARCERATED WOMEN.	2010

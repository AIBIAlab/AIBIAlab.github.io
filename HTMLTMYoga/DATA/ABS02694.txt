1 2694 72 YOGA INDUCED ACUTE ULNAR NERVE COMPRESSION BY A GANGLION CYST IN GUYON'S CANAL. ACUTE ULNAR NEUROPATHY AT THE WRIST CAN BE DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE, AS IT IS AN UNCOMMON NEUROPATHY WITH VARIABLE CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS AND NUMEROUS ETIOLOGIES. WE PRESENT A CASE OF ACUTE ULNAR NEUROPATHY OF THE DEEP MOTOR BRANCH CAUSED BY A GANGLION CYST IN GUYON'S CANAL. INTERESTINGLY, THIS CASE OF ACUTE LOSS OF MOTOR FUNCTION OCCURRED AFTER THE PATIENT PARTICIPATED IN YOGA (SPECIFICALLY THE DOWNWARD DOG POSITION), AND RESOLVED SPONTANEOUSLY OVER TIME AFTER STOPPING YOGA, WITHOUT SURGICAL EXCISION OF THE GANGLION, SUGGESTING EXACERBATION OR PROTRUSION OF AN OCCULT GANGLION CYST DUE TO INCREASED ACTIVITY AND COMPRESSION OF THE HYPOTHENAR EMINENCE.	2013

3 1265 11 FLEXIBILITY-NOT JUST FOR YOGA ANYMORE! OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, NUCLEOSIDES HAVE MAINTAINED A PROMINENT ROLE AS ONE OF THE CORNERSTONES OF ANTIVIRAL AND ANTICANCER THERAPEUTICS, AND MANY APPROACHES TO NUCLEOSIDE DRUG DESIGN HAVE BEEN PURSUED. ONE SUCH APPROACH INVOLVES FLEXIBILITY IN THE SUGAR MOIETY OF NUCLEOSIDES, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL ANTI-HIV AND HBV DRUG TENOFOVIR. IN CONTRAST, INTRODUCTION OF FLEXIBILITY TO THE NUCLEOBASE SCAFFOLD HAS ONLY MORE RECENTLY GAINED SIGNIFICANCE WITH THE INVENTION OF OUR FLEXIMERS. THE HISTORY, DEVELOPMENT, AND SOME BIOLOGICAL RELEVANCE FOR THIS INNOVATIVE CLASS OF NUCLEOSIDES ARE DETAILED HEREIN.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
4 1433 13 IMPROVING THE DEGREE OF PUBIC ARCH POST-YOGA EXERCISE DURING PREGNANCY. YOGA EXERCISES UNDERTAKEN DURING THE MATERNITY PERIOD MAY REDUCE UNPLEASANT SYMPTOMS DURING PREGNANCY AND REDUCE DELIVERY PAIN. FLEXIBILITY OF THE HIP JOINT IMPROVES THE DEGREE OF PUBIC ARCH CREATED IN AN OPEN-LEG POSTURE AND WIDENS THE PELVIC OUTLET REGION, SHORTENING THE TIME REQUIRED FOR DELIVERY AND FACILITATING EASY DELIVERY. THE DEGREE OF PUBIC ARCH IS RELATED TO THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE HIP JOINT. ALTHOUGH MANY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THE EFFECT OF YOGA EXERCISE DURING PREGNANCY, THE EFFECT ON THE DEGREE OF THE PUBIC ARCH HAS NOT BEEN ELUCIDATED. TO ELUCIDATE WHETHER THE DEGREE OF THE PUBIC ARCH IS IMPROVED BY YOGA EXERCISE DURING PREGNANCY, THIS STUDY ENROLLED 177 PREGNANT SUBJECTS. THE DEGREE OF PUBIC ARCH PRE- AND POST-YOGA EXERCISE WAS MEASURED USING INSTRUMENTS IN AN OPEN-LEG POSTURE (SEATED WITH FEMURS ABDUCTED). THE MEAN PUBIC ARCH PRE- AND POST-YOGA WAS 122.61 AND 127.93 DEGREES, RESPECTIVELY. THE DEGREE OF PUBIC ARCH POST-YOGA SESSIONS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED COMPARED WITH PRE-YOGA SESSIONS (P < 0.01). THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT YOGA EXERCISES DURING THE PREGNANCY PERIOD APPEAR TO IMPROVE THE DEGREE OF PUBIC ARCH.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
5  533 12 COMPARISON OF TWO TAGTEACH ERROR-CORRECTION PROCEDURES TO TEACH BEGINNER YOGA POSES TO ADULTS. TEACHING WITH ACOUSTICAL GUIDANCE INVOLVES AUDITORY FEEDBACK (E.G., A CLICK SOUND WHEN A DESIRED BEHAVIOR OCCURS) AS PART OF A MULTICOMPONENT INTERVENTION KNOWN AS TAGTEACH. TAGTEACH HAS BEEN FOUND TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE IN SPORT, DANCE, SURGICAL TECHNIQUE, AND WALKING. WE COMPARED THE EFFICACY AND EFFICIENCY OF THE STANDARD TAGTEACH ERROR-CORRECTION PROCEDURE AND A MODIFIED TAGTEACH ERROR-CORRECTION PROCEDURE TO TEACH 4 NOVICE ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS BEGINNER YOGA POSES. BOTH ERROR-CORRECTION PROCEDURES WERE EFFECTIVE FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS; HOWEVER, THE RELATIVE EFFICIENCY OF THESE ERROR-CORRECTION PROCEDURES WAS UNCLEAR.

WE POSTULATE THAT A SEVERE REDUCTION IN BLOOD FLOW AND POSSIBLY AN INTIMAL TEAR TRIGGERED THROMBOSIS OF THE VERTEBRAL ARTERY AND THAT THE FINAL STROKE MECHANISM WAS ARTERY-TO-ARTERY EMBOLISM.	1993	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
7 2914 22 [SPONTANOUS PNEUMOMEDIASTINUM AFTER YOGA PRACTICE - A CASE REPORT]. PNEUMOMEDIASTINUM IS DEFINED AS INTERSTITIAL AIR IN THE MEDIASTINUM, WITHOUT ANY APPARENT PRECIPATING FACTOR SUCH AS TRAUMA, OESOPHAGEAL PERFORATION OR INFECTIONS. IT IS VERY UNCOMMON AND USUALLY AFFECTS YOUNG OTHERWISE HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS. THE MOST COMMON SYMTOMS ARE CHEST PAIN AND DYSPNEA WITH SUBCUTANEOUS EMPHYSEMA FOUND ON EXAMINATION. TREATMENT IS USUALLY CONSERVATIVE WITH PAIN RELIEF. HERE, WE PRESENT AN UNUSUAL CASE OF A 23-YEAR-OLD PREVIOUSLY HEALTHY MALE WHO WAS DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMOMEDIASTINUM AFTER PRACTISING YOGA. THIS CASE DEMONSTRATES THE NEED TO STUDY PATIENTS WITH CHEST PAIN OF UNKNOWN CAUSE IN DETAILS TO FIND CAUSES.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
8 1416 14 IMPORTANCE OF MANAS TATTVA: A SEARCHLIGHT IN YOGA DARSHANA. SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL 'MANAS' HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF CURIOSITY FOR SCHOLARS, SCIENTISTS AND PHILOSOPHERS. THE REASON BEHIND THIS CURIOSITY IS ITS IMPORTANCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MANKIND. HUMAN BEING IS SUPERIOR TO OTHER CREATURES IN THE SERIES OF DEVELOPMENT. THIS SUPREMACY OF MAN REMAINS IN HIS QUALITY TO WORK AFTER THINKING, WHICH IS THE FUNCTION OF 'MANAS'. NO OTHER ANIMAL IS CAPABLE TO THINK LOGICALLY. THIS IS THE ONLY REASON WHICH LEADS THE MANKIND TO THE CREST OF DEVELOPMENT IN EVERY ASPECT. TO HIGHLIGHT THE CONCEPT OF MANAS IN YOGA DARSHANA, INFORMATION EXTRACTED FROM YOGA LITERATURES AND AYURVEDIC SAMHITAS. IN INDIAN CULTURE MIND HAS BEEN DESCRIBED FROM VARIOUS ANGLES. VEDIC, PHILOSOPHICAL AND AYURVEDIC LITERATURES HAVE A VAST AND EXCLUSIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANAS. PHILOSOPHERS EITHER ASTIKA OR NASTIKA HAVE DESCRIBED MANAS SIDDHANTA VIVIDLY. THOUGH MANY KINDS OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINIONS ARE THERE, YOGA DARSHANA ACCEPT THE IMPORTANCE OF MIND IN THE PROCESS OF PERCEPTION AND EVEN FOR THE BIRTH OF ANY INDIVIDUAL.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
9 1674 11 NURTURING THE FEMALE BODY: NOTIONS OF WELLBEING IN WOMB YOGA. ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES WHICH AIM TO ENHANCE WOMEN'S WELLBEING HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF CONTRIBUTING TO HEALTHIST AND POSTFEMINIST AGENDAS WHICH REST UPON A NEOLIBERAL LOGIC. I CRITICALLY ENGAGE WITH THIS ISSUE HERE THROUGH AN ETHNOGRAPHIC STUDY OF WOMB YOGA, A WOMEN'S ALTERNATIVE THERAPY DEVELOPED IN THE UK. I ARGUE THAT WHILE BEING COMMERCIAL AND EMPHASIZING PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY, WOMB YOGA LARGELY WORKS AGAINST THE CURRENT NEOLIBERAL OPTIMIZATION IDEAL. WOMB YOGA PRACTITIONERS DISMISS GOAL-ORIENTED SELF-MANAGEMENT AND DISCIPLINE, AND AVOID A SIMPLE REPRODUCTION OF GENDER STEREOTYPES BY DEFLECTING CARE AWAY FROM OTHER-DIRECTEDNESS AND OPENING THE INTERPRETATION OF FEMININITY TO THE IMAGINATIVE AND EXPERIENTIAL REALMS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
10 1764 15 POSTNATAL DEVELOPMENT AND REPRODUCTIVE PERFORMANCE OF F1 PROGENY EXPOSED IN UTERO TO AN AYURVEDIC CONTRACEPTIVE: PIPPALIYADI YOGA. PIPPALIYADI YOGA OR PIPPALIYADI VATI IS AN AYURVEDIC CONTRACEPTIVE USED IN INDIA SINCE ANCIENT TIMES. IT IS A COMBINATION OF POWDERED FRUIT BERRIES OF EMBELIA RIBES BURM.F. (MYRSINACEAE), PIPER LONGUM L. (PIPERACEAE) AND BORAX IN EQUAL PROPORTION. THOUGH THE CONTRACEPTIVE POTENTIAL IS KNOWN SINCE ANCIENT TIMES, NO SYSTEMATIC DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY STUDIES HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT TO EVALUATE THE POSTNATAL DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY AND THE REPRODUCTIVE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGENY EXPOSED IN UTERO TO PIPPALIYADI. PIPPALIYADI YOGA WAS OBTAINED FROM NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR PHARMACEUTICAL EDUCATION AND RESEARCH (NIPER), INDIA AND THE DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY WAS STUDIED BY ADMINISTERING THREE DOSES, VIZ. 140, 300 AND 700 MG/(KG DAY) TO GRAVID FEMALES FROM DAY 6 TO DAY 16 OF GESTATION. PIPPALIYADI DID NOT HAVE ANY ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTAL EFFECTS WITH LOW DOSES, HOWEVER, WITH THE FIVE TIMES HIGHER DOSE, A DECREASE IN BODY WEIGHT OF THE PUPS WAS OBSERVED. THE REPRODUCTIVE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGENY BORN TO MOTHERS TREATED WITH PIPPALIYADI WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED. THE PRESENT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT IN UTERO EXPOSURE TO PIPPALIYADI DOES NOT HAVE ANY ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE POSTNATAL DEVELOPMENT AND REPRODUCTIVE PERFORMANCE OF THE F(1) PROGENY.	2007

THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT EFFECTIVELY ESTABLISHING A HOLDING ENVIRONMENT CAN FACILITATE BOTH SOMATIC AND DEEP STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN A CLIENT, FACILITATING HEALING FROM PRIMAL WOUNDING AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL RECONNECTION TO THE TRUE SELF.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
12 1993 15 STANDARDISATION OF KUTAJADI VISHESH YOGA. AMOEBIASIS IS A PROBLEM IN NORTHERN INDIA. IN AYURVEDA SEVERAL HERBAL DRUGS ARE MENTIONED, TO BE USED FOR CONTROLLING THE AMATISARA (AMOEBIASIS) BUT NONE OF THE DRUG ARE FOUND HAVING POTENT EFFECT TO IRADICATE THE DISEASE. IN ANCIENT LITERATURE KUTAJ (HOLARRHENA ANTIDYSENTRICA) IS MENTIONED IN COMMONEST WAS FOR CONTROLLING THE DISEASE THIS PLANT IS PREVALENTLY FOUND IN HIMALAYAN AND VINDHAYA AREA. IT IS VERY EFFECTIVE FOR RELIEVING AMOEBIASIS. BY SEEING ITS THEURAPTIC IMPORTANCE WE HAVE TRIED TO STANDARDIZE THE COMPOUND IN WHOLE WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO KUTAJ. THE DETAIL COMPOSITION AND METHOD OF PREPARATION OF DRUG WITH ITS THERAPEUTIC EFFECT WILL BE NARRATED DURING THE TIME OF WORKSHOP.	1998	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
13 1501 23 INVERTED YOGA AND NEAR SYNCOPE: AN UNUSUAL DIAGNOSIS OF RIGHT VENTRICULAR MYXOMA. PRIMARY CARDIAC TUMORS ARE EXTREMELY RARE AND ARE DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE. ALTHOUGH USUALLY BENIGN IN NATURE, MYXOMAS REQUIRE SURGICAL RESECTION DUE TO THEIR INCREASED RISK OF EMBOLIC AND CARDIAC COMPLICATIONS, WITH THE TIMING OF RESECTION DEPENDENT ON THE PRESENTATION AND SIZE OF THE TUMOR. HOWEVER, IF DIAGNOSED EARLY, PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY BENIGN CARDIAC TUMORS HAVE EXCELLENT PROGNOSIS FOLLOWING SURGERY. THEREFORE, A HIGH INDEX OF SUSPICION AND A WIDE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN DETECTING RARE CONDITIONS THAT CAN AFFECT OTHERWISE HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS. WE PRESENT AN UNCOMMON CASE OF A RIGHT VENTRICULAR MYXOMA THAT WAS DISCOVERED WHEN THE PATIENT WAS PERFORMING INVERTED YOGA AND EXPERIENCED A NEAR SYNCOPAL EPISODE. PATIENT SUBSEQUENTLY UNDERWENT AN ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION AND WAS FOUND TO HAVE A RIGHT VENTRICULAR MYXOMA THAT WAS EXCISED. ALTHOUGH RECURRENCE IS RARE, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR PHYSICIANS TO REMAIN VIGILANT AND CONTINUE CAREFUL AND CONSISTENT FOLLOW-UP FOR PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF A CARDIAC MYXOMA.	2018

15  481 14 CLINICAL EFFICACY OF APAMARGA KSHARA YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SHVITRA (VITILIGO). INTRODUCTION: VITILIGO IS A PROGRESSIVE, IDIOPATHIC, PIGMENTATION DISORDER OF THE SKIN, CHARACTERIZED BY HYPOPIGMENTED PATCHES. THIS CONDITION IS COMPARED WITH SHVITRA IN AYURVEDA. MANY AYURVEDIC DRUGS ARE BENEFICIAL IN SUCH CASES AND APAMARGA KSHARA YOGA IS ONE AMONG THEM. AIM: TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF APAMARGA KSHARA YOGA IN LEPA AND OINTMENT FORMS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SHVITRA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TOTAL 50 PATIENTS OF SHVITRA WERE RANDOMLY GROUPED INTO TWO. PATIENTS REGISTERED IN GROUP A (N = 25) WERE TREATED WITH APAMARGA KSHARA YOGA LEPA AND GROUP B (N = 25) WITH APAMARGA KSHARA YOGA OINTMENT FOR 2 MONTHS. RASAYANA CHURNA (3G) ALONG WITH HONEY AND GHEE WAS GIVEN TWICE DAILY INTERNALLY IN THE BOTH GROUPS. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT WAS FOUND IN THE SYMPTOMS OF SHVITRA WITH TREATMENT IN BOTH THE GROUPS. THE DIFFERENCE IN BETWEEN THE GROUPS WAS STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT. CONCLUSION: BOTH FORMS OF APAMRAGA KSHARA YOGA ARE EFFECTIVE IN CASES OF SHVITRA AND CAN BE GOOD ALTERNATIVES FOR CONTEMPORARY MEDICINES.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
16 1614 13 MIND AND CONSCIOUSNESS IN YOGA - VEDANTA: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WITH WESTERN PSYCHOLOGICAL CONCEPTS. STUDY OF MIND AND CONSCIOUSNESS THROUGH ESTABLISHED SCIENTIFIC METHODS IS OFTEN DIFFICULT DUE TO THE OBSERVED-OBSERVER DICHOTOMY. CARTESIAN APPROACH OF DUALISM CONSIDERING THE MIND AND MATTER AS TWO DIVERSE AND UNCONNECTED ENTITIES HAS BEEN QUESTIONED BY ORIENTAL SCHOOLS OF YOGA AND VEDANTA AS WELL AS THE RECENT QUANTUM THEORIES OF MODERN PHYSICS. FREUDIAN AND NEO-FREUDIAN SCHOOLS BASED ON THE CARTESIAN MODEL HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED BY THE HUMANISTIC SCHOOLS WHICH COME MUCH CLOSER TO THE VEDANTIC APPROACH OF UNITARINESS. A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE TWO APPROACHES IS DISCUSSED.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
17  409 19 BLENDING MARTIAL ARTS AND YOGA FOR HEALTH: FROM THE LAST SAMURAI TO THE FIRST ODAKA YOGA WARRIOR. THIS PAPER INTRODUCES THE CASE STUDY OF ODAKA YOGA, AN INNOVATIVE STYLE OF POSTURAL YOGA BLENDED WITH MARTIAL ARTS ELEMENTS WHICH EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF PRACTITIONERS' HEALTH AND PROCESSES OF SELF-TRANSFORMATION AS PIVOTAL TO THE SCHOOL'S ETHOS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE PAPER EXPLORES HOW ODAKA YOGA'S PHILOSOPHICAL BACKDROPS AND PRACTICAL REPERTOIRE, COMPOSED BY A MIXTURE OF "EXOTIC" RESOURCES SUCH AS BUSHIDO, ZEN, YOGA, AND A CONSTANT REFERENCE TO THE OCEAN WAVES AND BIOMECHANICS, CONSTITUTE A VERY SPECIFIC VISION OF HEALTH AT THE INTERSECTION OF WESTERN SCIENCE AND ESOTERIC KNOWLEDGE. THEORETICALLY, THE PAPER BORROWS FROM JENNINGS' THEORY OF MARTIAL CREATION AND ENRICHES IT WITH SOME OF THE CENTRAL ANALYTICAL TOOLS PROPOSED BY THEORISTS SUCH AS BOURDIEU AND FOUCAULT. METHODOLOGICALLY, IT RELIES ON A MULTIMODAL APPROACH INCLUDING DISCURSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE SCHOOL'S PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS, INTERVIEWS WITH THE FOUNDERS AND OTHER KEY TEACHERS, AND OBSERVANT PARTICIPATION OF PRACTITIONERS' APPRENTICESHIP PROCESSES. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE BIRTH OF ODAKA YOGA AS OCCURRING AT THE INTERSECTION OF ASIAN MARTIAL ARTS AND YOGA, AS WELL AS THE FOUNDERS' BIOGRAPHICAL TRAJECTORIES FROM THE WORLD OF COMPETITIVE MARTIAL ARTS AND FITNESS, TO YOGA; IT THEN TURNS TO AN EXAMINATION OF ODAKA YOGA'S CONCEPTION OF HEALTH AS A MIXTURE OF THE WESTERN BIOMEDICAL MODEL AND THE SUBTLE BODY MODEL OF ASIAN TRADITIONS SUCH AS YOGA AND MARTIAL ARTS. IT ARGUES THAT THE CONCEPTION OF HEALTH PROMOTED BY THIS SCHOOL GIVES RISE TO THE ODAKA YOGA WARRIOR, THE IDEAL-TYPICAL PRACTITIONER WHOSE BODY IS SIMULTANEOUSLY EXPOSED TO THE MEDICAL GAZE AND ITS IMPERATIVES OF CONTROL, KNOWLEDGE, AND MANIPULATION; WHILE IT ALSO DEIFIES IT, AS IT IS ANIMATED BY THE ELUSIVE FLOWS OF ENERGY (QI OR PRANA) THAT PROLONGED PRACTICE AIMS TO MASTER. THE PAPER CONCLUDES WITH A REFLECTION ON HYBRID CONCEPTIONS OF HEALTH AND THE UBIQUITOUS ROLE OF HEALTH DISCOURSES AND NARRATIVES ACROSS SOCIOCULTURAL DOMAINS.	2020	

18 2500 13 YOGA AS THE "NEXT WAVE" OF THERAPEUTIC MODALITIES FOR TREATMENT OF INSOMNIA. INSOMNIA RATES CONTINUE TO RISE, ESPECIALLY AMONG SPECIFIC POPULATIONS. CURRENT NONPHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENTS RELY PRIMARILY UPON COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR INSOMNIA (CBT-I), WHICH WAS INTRODUCED IN THE 1970S. NEWER TREATMENTS HAVE INCORPORATED CBT "THIRD WAVE" TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING MINDFULNESS AND ACCEPTANCE TECHNIQUES. YOGA PRACTICE IS WELL SUITED TO COMPLEMENT EXISTING THERAPIES AND TO ADDRESS SLEEP PROBLEMS IN A MORE HOLISTIC WAY. CURRENT THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL APPROACHES TO TREATING INSOMNIA ARE DISCUSSED, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON THE ROLE OF YOGA IN ADDRESSING PRECIPITATING AND PERPETUATING FACTORS IN INSOMNIA THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN LARGELY OVERLOOKED.AN ESTIMATED ONE-THIRD OF U.S. ADULTS SUFFER FROM INSOMNIA (CHEN, GELAYE, & WILLIAMS, 2013; MELLINGER, BALTER, & UHLENHUTH, 1985; OHAYON, 2002), AND THE PROBLEM APPEARS TO BE GROWING. WHILE TREATMENT FOR INSOMNIA HAS HELPED TO ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM FOR SOME (IRWIN, COLE, & NICASSIO, 2006; MORIN ET AL., 2009), PREVALENCE OF INSOMNIA IS ON THE RISE, ESPECIALLY AMONG CERTAIN GROUPS, INCLUDING ELDERLY AND MILITARY POPULATIONS (MORIN, 2009; MYSLIWIEC ET AL., 2013). RISING RATES OF INSOMNIA HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO CHANGES IN LIFESTYLE AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, INCLUDING INCREASED RELIANCE ON TECHNOLOGY AND DECREASED SYNCHRONY WITH NATURAL WAKE-SLEEP RHYTHMS (BRAHINSKY, 2013; WALLACE-GUY ET AL., 2002; YUN, BAZAR, GERBER, LEE, & DANIEL, 2005).	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
19 1656 13 MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURIES RELATED TO YOGA: IMAGING OBSERVATIONS. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO DESCRIBE THE IMAGING APPEARANCES OF MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURIES RELATED TO YOGA. WE PERFORMED AN AUTOMATED SEARCH IN THE DATABASE OF A LARGE TERTIARY CARE CENTER AND CONDUCTED A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE IMAGING FINDINGS IN 38 PATIENTS OVER A 9-YEAR PERIOD. CONCLUSION: THE MOST FREQUENTLY ENCOUNTERED MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURIES WERE TENDINOUS LESIONS, INCLUDING TEARS OF THE SUPRASPINATUS, ACHILLES, AND PERONEUS BREVIS TENDONS AND FIBROCARTILAGINOUS TEARS INVOLVING THE MEDIAL MENISCUS, ACETABULAR LABRUM, GLENOID LABRUM, AND LUMBAR DISK WITH EXTRUSION.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
20 1736 20 PHOTO URTICARIA CAUSED BY EXPOSURE TO LED EMITTING 633-NM WAVELENGTH DURING HOT YOGA EXERCISE. PHOTO URTICARIA (PU) IS A RARE TYPE OF URTICARIA THAT DEVELOPS AFTER EXPOSURE TO VARIOUS WAVELENGTHS OF LIGHT. INDUCING URTICARIAL WHEALS USING LIGHT SOURCES OF PERTINENT WAVELENGTHS CAN HELP MAKE THE DEFINITIVE DIAGNOSIS OF PU. THE ACTION SPECTRA (AS) IN JAPANESE PATIENTS WITH PU COMMONLY FALL WITHIN THE ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION A AND VISIBLE LIGHT RANGE. HEREIN, TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, WE PRESENT THE FIRST CASE OF PU CAUSED BY 633-NM WAVELENGTH WITHIN THE VISIBLE LIGHT SPECTRUM. OUR PATIENT WORKED AS A "HOT YOGA" INSTRUCTOR, WHERE LIGHT-EMITTING DIODES (LEDS) ON THE CEILING WERE USED TO IRRADIATE THE ENTIRE ROOM WITH 633-NM WAVELENGTH OF LIGHT FOR "LIGHT TREATMENT." SHE REPORTED ITCHING AND WHEALS ON THE FACE AND NECK DURING HER "HOT YOGA" SESSIONS. "HOT YOGA" HAS RECENTLY GAINED POPULARITY GLOBALLY. THE "LIGHT TREATMENT" IS BASED ON THE THEORY THAT 633-NM WAVELENGTH LIGHT WITHIN THE VISIBLE LIGHT SPECTRUM REPORTEDLY PREVENTS THE SKIN FROM AGING. WE INDUCED WHEALS WITH ERYTHEMA BY IRRADIATING HER SKIN USING A 633-NM LED AT A DOSE OF 0.008 J/CM(2) /S FOR 1 H. HER CONDITION WAS DIAGNOSED AS PU CAUSED BY EXPOSURE TO 633 NM. LIGHT. HER SYMPTOMS HAVE NOT RECURRED SINCE SHE HAS AVOIDED BEING EXPOSED TO THE 633-NM WAVELENGTH OF LED LIGHT.	2021

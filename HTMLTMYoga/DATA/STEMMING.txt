1 2619 82 YOGA FOR STRESS REDUCTION AND INJURY PREVENTION AT WORK. AT WORK EMPLOYEES FACE NUMEROUS PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESSORS THAT CAN UNDERMINE THEIR WORK PERFORMANCE. THESE STRESSORS, STEMMING FROM A VARIETY OF POSSIBLE CAUSES, HAVE ENORMOUS HEALTH AND FINANCIAL IMPACTS ON EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS EMPLOYERS. STRESS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE ONE OF THE FACTORS LEADING TO MUSCULO-SKELETAL DISORDERS (MSDS) SUCH AS: INCLUDE BACK PAIN, CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME, SHOULDER OR NECK TENSION, EYE STRAIN, OR HEADACHES. YOGA IS AN ANCIENT FORM OF EXERCISE THAT CAN REDUCE STRESS AND RELIEVE MUSCULAR TENSION OR PAIN. PRACTICING YOGA AT THE WORKPLACE TEACHES EMPLOYEES TO USE RELAXATION TECHNIQUES TO REDUCE STRESS AND RISKS OF INJURY ON THE JOB. YOGA AT THE WORKPLACE IS A CONVENIENT AND PRACTICAL OUTLET THAT IMPROVES WORK PERFORMANCE BY RELIEVING TENSION AND JOB STRESS.	2002	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
2 1460 21 INFLUENCE OF YOGA ON CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE AND ON MEDIATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CHANGES IN SLEEP AND CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE: A NATIONWIDE, MULTICENTER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA IN CANCER SURVIVORS. BACKGROUND: CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (CRF) OFTEN CO-OCCURS WITH SLEEP DISTURBANCE AND IS ONE OF THE MOST PERVASIVE TOXICITIES RESULTING FROM CANCER AND ITS TREATMENT. WE AND OTHER INVESTIGATORS HAVE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THAT YOGA THERAPY CAN IMPROVE SLEEP QUALITY IN CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS. NO NATIONWIDE MULTICENTER PHASE III RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) HAS INVESTIGATED WHETHER YOGA THERAPY IMPROVES CRF OR WHETHER IMPROVEMENTS IN SLEEP MEDIATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON CRF. WE EXAMINED THE EFFECT OF A STANDARDIZED, 4-WEEK, YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM (YOGA FOR CANCER SURVIVORS [YOCAS]) ON CRF AND WHETHER YOCAS-INDUCED CHANGES IN SLEEP MEDIATED CHANGES IN CRF AMONG SURVIVORS. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: FOUR HUNDRED TEN CANCER SURVIVORS WERE RECRUITED TO A NATIONWIDE MULTICENTER PHASE III RCT COMPARING THE EFFECT OF YOCAS TO STANDARD SURVIVORSHIP CARE ON CRF AND EXAMINING THE MEDIATING EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN SLEEP, STEMMING FROM YOGA, ON CHANGES IN CRF. CRF WAS ASSESSED BY THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL FATIGUE SYMPTOM INVENTORY. SLEEP WAS ASSESSED VIA THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX. BETWEEN- AND WITHIN-GROUP INTERVENTION EFFECTS ON CRF WERE ASSESSED BY ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE AND 2-TAILED T TEST, RESPECTIVELY. PATH ANALYSIS WAS USED TO EVALUATE MEDIATION. RESULTS: YOCAS PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN CRF COMPARED WITH PARTICIPANTS IN STANDARD SURVIVORSHIP CARE AT POST-INTERVENTION ( P < .01). IMPROVEMENTS IN OVERALL SLEEP QUALITY AND REDUCTIONS IN DAYTIME DYSFUNCTION (EG, EXCESSIVE NAPPING) RESULTING FROM YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY MEDIATED THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON CRF (22% AND 37%, RESPECTIVELY, BOTH P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: YOCAS IS EFFECTIVE FOR TREATING CRF AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS; 22% TO 37% OF THE IMPROVEMENTS IN CRF FROM YOGA THERAPY RESULT FROM IMPROVEMENTS IN SLEEP QUALITY AND DAYTIME DYSFUNCTION. ONCOLOGISTS SHOULD CONSIDER PRESCRIBING YOGA TO CANCER SURVIVORS FOR TREATING CRF AND SLEEP DISTURBANCE.	2019	

3 2538 22 YOGA FOR ADULT WOMEN WITH CHRONIC PTSD: A LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP STUDY. INTRODUCTION: YOGA-THE INTEGRATIVE PRACTICE OF PHYSICAL POSTURES AND MOVEMENT, BREATH EXERCISES, AND MINDFULNESS-MAY SERVE AS A USEFUL ADJUNCTIVE COMPONENT OF TRAUMA-FOCUSED TREATMENT TO BUILD SKILLS IN TOLERATING AND MODULATING PHYSIOLOGIC AND AFFECTIVE STATES THAT HAVE BECOME DYSREGULATED BY TRAUMA EXPOSURE. A PREVIOUS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT AMONG 60 WOMEN WITH CHRONIC, TREATMENT-RESISTANT POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) AND ASSOCIATED MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS STEMMING FROM PROLONGED OR MULTIPLE TRAUMA EXPOSURES. AFTER 10 SESSIONS OF YOGA, PARTICIPANTS EXHIBITED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN PTSD SYMPTOM SEVERITY AND GREATER LIKELIHOOD OF LOSS OF PTSD DIAGNOSIS, SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN ENGAGEMENT IN NEGATIVE TENSION REDUCTION ACTIVITIES (E.G., SELF-INJURY), AND GREATER REDUCTIONS IN DISSOCIATIVE AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS WHEN COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL (A SEMINAR IN WOMEN'S HEALTH). THE CURRENT STUDY IS A LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENT OF PARTICIPANTS WHO COMPLETED THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS FROM THE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WERE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENTS APPROXIMATELY 1.5 YEARS AFTER STUDY COMPLETION TO ASSESS WHETHER THE INITIAL INTERVENTION AND/OR YOGA PRACTICE AFTER TREATMENT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH ADDITIONAL CHANGES. FORTY-NINE WOMEN COMPLETED THE LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP INTERVIEWS. HIERARCHICAL REGRESSION ANALYSIS WAS USED TO EXAMINE WHETHER TREATMENT GROUP STATUS IN THE ORIGINAL STUDY AND FREQUENCY OF YOGA PRACTICE AFTER THE STUDY PREDICTED GREATER CHANGES IN SYMPTOMS AND PTSD DIAGNOSIS. RESULTS: GROUP ASSIGNMENT IN THE ORIGINAL RANDOMIZED STUDY WAS NOT A SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR OF LONGER-TERM OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, FREQUENCY OF CONTINUING YOGA PRACTICE SIGNIFICANTLY PREDICTED GREATER DECREASES IN PTSD SYMPTOM SEVERITY AND DEPRESSION SYMPTOM SEVERITY, AS WELL AS A GREATER LIKELIHOOD OF A LOSS OF PTSD DIAGNOSIS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA APPEARS TO BE A USEFUL TREATMENT MODALITY; THE GREATEST LONG-TERM BENEFITS ARE DERIVED FROM MORE FREQUENT YOGA PRACTICE.	2016	
                    
4 2382 12 YOCAS(C)(R) YOGA REDUCES SELF-REPORTED MEMORY DIFFICULTY IN CANCER SURVIVORS IN A NATIONWIDE RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL: INVESTIGATING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MEMORY AND SLEEP. UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND INTERVENTIONS ARE NEEDED TO ALLEVIATE MEMORY DIFFICULTY IN CANCER SURVIVORS. WE PREVIOUSLY SHOWED IN A PHASE III RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL THAT YOCAS(C)(R) YOGA-A PROGRAM THAT CONSISTS OF BREATHING EXERCISES, POSTURES, AND MEDITATION-SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED SLEEP QUALITY IN CANCER SURVIVORS. THIS STUDY ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF YOCAS(C)(R) ON MEMORY AND IDENTIFIED RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MEMORY AND SLEEP. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: SURVIVORS WERE RANDOMIZED TO STANDARD CARE (SC) OR SC WITH YOCAS(C)(R) . 328 PARTICIPANTS WHO PROVIDED DATA ON THE MEMORY DIFFICULTY ITEM OF THE MD ANDERSON SYMPTOM INVENTORY ARE INCLUDED. SLEEP QUALITY WAS MEASURED USING THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX. GENERAL LINEAR MODELING (GLM) DETERMINED THE GROUP EFFECT OF YOCAS(C)(R) ON MEMORY DIFFICULTY COMPARED WITH SC. GLM ALSO DETERMINED MODERATION OF BASELINE MEMORY DIFFICULTY ON POSTINTERVENTION SLEEP AND VICE VERSA. PATH MODELING ASSESSED THE MEDIATING EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN MEMORY DIFFICULTY ON YOCAS(C)(R) CHANGES IN SLEEP AND VICE VERSA. RESULTS: YOCAS(C)(R) SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED MEMORY DIFFICULTY AT POSTINTERVENTION COMPARED WITH SC (MEAN CHANGE: YOGA=-0.60; SC=-0.16; P<.05). BASELINE MEMORY DIFFICULTY DID NOT MODERATE THE EFFECTS OF POSTINTERVENTION SLEEP QUALITY IN YOCAS(C)(R) COMPARED WITH SC. BASELINE SLEEP QUALITY DID MODERATE THE EFFECTS OF POSTINTERVENTION MEMORY DIFFICULTY IN YOCAS(C)(R) COMPARED WITH SC (P<.05). CHANGES IN SLEEP QUALITY WAS A SIGNIFICANT MEDIATOR OF REDUCED MEMORY DIFFICULTY IN YOCAS(C)(R) COMPARED WITH SC (P<.05); HOWEVER, CHANGES IN MEMORY DIFFICULTY DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY MEDIATE IMPROVED SLEEP QUALITY IN YOCAS(C)(R) COMPARED WITH SC. CONCLUSIONS: IN THIS LARGE NATIONWIDE TRIAL, YOCAS(C)(R) YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED PATIENT-REPORTED MEMORY DIFFICULTY IN CANCER SURVIVORS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                
5 2879 19 YOGA. YOGA IS AN ANCIENT TRADITION THAT HAS BEEN WESTERNIZED AND OFTEN PRACTICED FOR ITS PROPOSED HEALTH BENEFITS. TRADITIONAL TEXTS DESCRIBE ITS BENEFITS FOR MANY TYPES OF ARTHRITIS. TWO LIMITED STUDIES OF YOGA IN OSTEOARTHRITIS OF THE HANDS AND CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME SHOW GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN PAIN THAN IN CONTROL GROUPS. YOGA USES STRETCHING AND IMPROVES STRENGTH SO THAT IT THEORETICALLY SHOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR SOME MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS. YOGA MERITS FURTHER STUDY INTO ITS CELLULAR AND PHYSIOLOGIC EFFECTS.	2000	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
6 2503 18 YOGA AS TREATMENT FOR INSOMNIA AMONG CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. MANY CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS, BETWEEN 15 TO 90%, REPORT SOME FORM OF INSOMNIA OR SLEEP QUALITY IMPAIRMENT DURING AND POST-TREATMENT, SUCH AS EXCESSIVE DAYTIME NAPPING, DIFFICULTY FALLING ASLEEP, DIFFICULTY STAYING ASLEEP, AND WAKING UP TOO EARLY. INSOMNIA AND SLEEP QUALITY IMPAIRMENT ARE AMONG THE MOST PREVALENT AND DISTRESSING PROBLEMS REPORTED BY CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS, AND CAN BE SEVERE ENOUGH TO INCREASE CANCER MORTALITY. DESPITE THE UBIQUITY OF INSOMNIA AND SLEEP QUALITY IMPAIRMENT, THEY ARE UNDER-DIAGNOSED AND UNDER-TREATED IN CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS. WHEN SLEEP PROBLEMS ARE PRESENT, PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS ARE OFTEN HESITANT TO PRESCRIBE OR TAKE PHARMACEUTICALS FOR SLEEP PROBLEMS DUE TO POLY PHARMACY CONCERNS, AND COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR INSOMNIA CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT AND IMPRACTICAL FOR PATIENTS TO ADHERE TO THROUGHOUT THE CANCER EXPERIENCE. RESEARCH SUGGESTS YOGA IS A WELL-TOLERATED EXERCISE INTERVENTION WITH PROMISING EVIDENCE FOR ITS EFFICACY IN IMPROVING INSOMNIA AND SLEEP QUALITY IMPAIRMENT AMONG SURVIVORS. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF EXISTING CLINICAL RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR TREATING INSOMNIA AND SLEEP QUALITY IMPAIRMENT AMONG CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
7 1650 22 MULTICENTER, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA FOR SLEEP QUALITY AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS. PURPOSE: THIRTY PERCENT TO 90% OF CANCER SURVIVORS REPORT IMPAIRED SLEEP QUALITY POST-TREATMENT, WHICH CAN BE SEVERE ENOUGH TO INCREASE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS EXERCISE, ARE RECOMMENDED IN CONJUNCTION WITH DRUGS AND COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF IMPAIRED SLEEP. PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT YOGA-A MIND-BODY PRACTICE AND FORM OF EXERCISE-MAY IMPROVE SLEEP AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS. THE PRIMARY AIM OF THIS RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF A STANDARDIZED YOGA INTERVENTION COMPARED WITH STANDARD CARE FOR IMPROVING GLOBAL SLEEP QUALITY (PRIMARY OUTCOME) AMONG POST-TREATMENT CANCER SURVIVORS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: IN ALL, 410 SURVIVORS SUFFERING FROM MODERATE OR GREATER SLEEP DISRUPTION BETWEEN 2 AND 24 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY, CHEMOTHERAPY, AND/OR RADIATION THERAPY WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO STANDARD CARE OR STANDARD CARE PLUS THE 4-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. THE YOGA INTERVENTION USED THE YOGA FOR CANCER SURVIVORS (YOCAS) PROGRAM CONSISTING OF PRANAYAMA (BREATHING EXERCISES), 16 GENTLE HATHA AND RESTORATIVE YOGA ASANAS (POSTURES), AND MEDITATION. PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED TWO 75-MINUTE SESSIONS PER WEEK. SLEEP QUALITY WAS ASSESSED BY USING THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX AND ACTIGRAPHY PRE- AND POSTINTERVENTION. RESULTS: IN ALL, 410 SURVIVORS WERE ACCRUED (96% FEMALE; MEAN AGE, 54 YEARS; 75% HAD BREAST CANCER). YOGA PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN GLOBAL SLEEP QUALITY AND, SECONDARILY, SUBJECTIVE SLEEP QUALITY, DAYTIME DYSFUNCTION, WAKE AFTER SLEEP ONSET, SLEEP EFFICIENCY, AND MEDICATION USE AT POSTINTERVENTION (ALL P </= .05) COMPARED WITH STANDARD CARE PARTICIPANTS. CONCLUSION: YOGA, SPECIFICALLY THE YOCAS PROGRAM, IS A USEFUL TREATMENT FOR IMPROVING SLEEP QUALITY AND REDUCING SLEEP MEDICATION USE AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
8 1052 17 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE AND GLOBAL SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN IN OLDER CANCER SURVIVORS. BACKGROUND: SIXTY PERCENT OF CANCER SURVIVORS ARE 65YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER. CANCER AND ITS TREATMENTS LEAD TO CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE AND MANY OTHER SIDE EFFECTS, IN TURN, CREATING SUBSTANTIAL GLOBAL SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN (TOTAL BURDEN FROM ALL SIDE EFFECTS) WHICH, ULTIMATELY, COMPROMISES FUNCTIONAL INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY OF LIFE. VARIOUS MODES OF EXERCISE, SUCH AS YOGA, REDUCE CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE AND GLOBAL SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN IN YOUNGER CANCER SURVIVORS, BUT NO STUDIES HAVE SPECIFICALLY EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON OLDER CANCER SURVIVORS. OBJECTIVES: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF A 4-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION (YOGA FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: YOCAS(C)(R)) ON OVERALL CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, AND DUE TO ITS MULTIDIMENSIONAL NATURE, THE SUBDOMAINS OF CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (GENERAL, PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, AND MENTAL) AND GLOBAL SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN IN OLDER CANCER SURVIVORS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A SECONDARY ANALYSIS ON DATA FROM A MULTICENTER PHASE III RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL WITH 2 ARMS (STANDARD CARE AND STANDARD CARE PLUS A 4-WEEK YOCAS(C)(R) INTERVENTION). THE SAMPLE FOR THIS SECONDARY ANALYSIS WAS 97 OLDER CANCER SURVIVORS (>/=60YEARS OF AGE), BETWEEN 2MONTHS AND 2YEARS POST-TREATMENT, WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE ORIGINAL TRIAL. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOCAS(C)(R) INTERVENTION ARM REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, PHYSICAL FATIGUE, MENTAL FATIGUE, AND GLOBAL SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN THAN PARTICIPANTS IN THE STANDARD CARE ARM FOLLOWING THE 4-WEEK INTERVENTION PERIOD (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: YOCAS(C)(R) IS AN EFFECTIVE STANDARDIZED YOGA INTERVENTION FOR REDUCING CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, PHYSICAL FATIGUE, MENTAL FATIGUE, AND GLOBAL SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN AMONG OLDER CANCER SURVIVORS.	2015

AIM/PURPOSE: THE CURRENT STUDY BUILDS ON EXTANT RESEARCH BY EXAMINING AN EXTENDED TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA TREATMENT FOR WOMEN WITH CHRONIC PTSD. THE STUDY SOUGHT TO OPTIMIZE THE RESULTS OF A TREATMENT PROTOCOL EXAMINED IN A RECENT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH A SHORTER DURATION AND WITHOUT ASSIGNMENT OR MONITORING OF HOME PRACTICE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE AUTHORS EXAMINED A 20-WEEK TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA TREATMENT IN A NON-RANDOMIZED SINGLE-GROUP TREATMENT FEASIBILITY STUDY FOR WOMEN WITH CHRONIC TREATMENT-RESISTANT PTSD (N = 9). THE AUTHORS EXAMINED PTSD AND DISSOCIATION SYMPTOM REDUCTION OVER SEVERAL ASSESSMENT PERIODS. RESULTS: THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN PTSD AND DISSOCIATIVE SYMPTOMATOLOGY ABOVE AND BEYOND SIMILAR TREATMENTS OF A SHORTER DURATION. CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT MORE INTENSIVE TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA TREATMENT CHARACTERIZED BY LONGER DURATION AND INTENTIONAL ASSIGNMENT AND MONITORING OF HOME PRACTICE MAY BE MORE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SEVERE AND CHRONIC PTSD. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS FOR THE POTENTIALLY MORE SUBSTANTIAL ROLE OF YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR A SUBSET OF ADULTS WITH CHRONIC TREATMENT-RESISTANT PTSD ARE DISCUSSED.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
10 2865 21 YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION FOR CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME: A RANDOMIZED TRIAL. CONTEXT: CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME IS A COMMON COMPLICATION OF REPETITIVE ACTIVITIES AND CAUSES SIGNIFICANT MORBIDITY. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A YOGA-BASED REGIMEN FOR RELIEVING SYMPTOMS OF CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME. DESIGN: RANDOMIZED, SINGLE-BLIND, CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: A GERIATRIC CENTER AND AN INDUSTRIAL SITE IN 1994-1995. PATIENTS: FORTY-TWO EMPLOYED OR RETIRED INDIVIDUALS WITH CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME (MEDIAN AGE, 52 YEARS; RANGE, 24-77 YEARS). INTERVENTION: SUBJECTS ASSIGNED TO THE YOGA GROUP RECEIVED A YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION CONSISTING OF 11 YOGA POSTURES DESIGNED FOR STRENGTHENING, STRETCHING, AND BALANCING EACH JOINT IN THE UPPER BODY ALONG WITH RELAXATION GIVEN TWICE WEEKLY FOR 8 WEEKS. PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP WERE OFFERED A WRIST SPLINT TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR CURRENT TREATMENT. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CHANGES FROM BASELINE TO 8 WEEKS IN GRIP STRENGTH, PAIN INTENSITY, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, PHALEN SIGN, AND TINEL SIGN, AND IN MEDIAN NERVE MOTOR AND SENSORY CONDUCTION TIME. RESULTS: SUBJECTS IN THE YOGA GROUPS HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN GRIP STRENGTH (INCREASED FROM 162 TO 187 MM HG; P = .009) AND PAIN REDUCTION (DECREASED FROM 5.0 TO 2.9 MM; P = .02), BUT CHANGES IN GRIP STRENGTH AND PAIN WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR CONTROL SUBJECTS. THE YOGA GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPROVEMENT IN PHALEN SIGN (12 IMPROVED VS 2 IN CONTROL GROUP; P = .008), BUT NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND IN SLEEP DISTURBANCE, TINEL SIGN, AND MEDIAN NERVE MOTOR AND SENSORY CONDUCTION TIME. CONCLUSION: IN THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY, A YOGA-BASED REGIMEN WAS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN WRIST SPLINTING OR NO TREATMENT IN RELIEVING SOME SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS OF CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME.	1998	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
11 1193 19 EXAMINING MECHANISMS OF CHANGE IN A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR WOMEN: THE INFLUENCE OF MINDFULNESS, PSYCHOLOGICAL FLEXIBILITY, AND EMOTION REGULATION ON PTSD SYMPTOMS. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY EXPLORED POSSIBLE MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH SYMPTOMS OF POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) WERE REDUCED IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING THE EFFECT OF A YOGA INTERVENTION WITH AN ASSESSMENT CONTROL. METHOD: WE EXAMINED WHETHER CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL FLEXIBILITY, MINDFULNESS, AND EMOTION REGULATION STRATEGIES (EXPRESSIVE SUPPRESSION AND REAPPRAISAL) WERE ASSOCIATED WITH POSTTREATMENT PTSD SYMPTOMS FOR 38 WOMEN WITH DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS FOURTH EDITION FULL OR SUBTHRESHOLD PTSD. RESULTS: HIERARCHICAL LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS REVEALED THAT EXPRESSIVE SUPPRESSION SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED FOR THE YOGA GROUP RELATIVE TO THE ASSESSMENT CONTROL. PSYCHOLOGICAL FLEXIBILITY INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY FOR THE CONTROL BUT NOT YOGA GROUP. HOWEVER, INCREASES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL FLEXIBILITY WERE ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASES IN PTSD SYMPTOMS FOR THE YOGA BUT NOT CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: PRELIMINARY FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY REDUCE EXPRESSIVE SUPPRESSION AND MAY IMPROVE PTSD SYMPTOMS BY INCREASING PSYCHOLOGICAL FLEXIBILITY. MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO REPLICATE AND EXTEND THESE FINDINGS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
12 2627 14 YOGA FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF CANCER TREATMENT-RELATED TOXICITIES. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: TO (1) EXPLAIN WHAT YOGA IS, (2) SUMMARIZE PUBLISHED LITERATURE ON THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR MANAGING CANCER TREATMENT-RELATED TOXICITIES, (3) PROVIDE CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE USE OF YOGA FOR ONCOLOGY PROFESSIONALS, AND (4) SUGGEST PROMISING AREAS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. RECENT FINDINGS: BASED ON A TOTAL OF 24 PHASE II AND ONE PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS, LOW-INTENSITY FORMS OF YOGA, SPECIFICALLY GENTLE HATHA AND RESTORATIVE, ARE FEASIBLE, SAFE, AND EFFECTIVE FOR TREATING SLEEP DISRUPTION, CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, PSYCHOSOCIAL DISTRESS, AND MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS IN CANCER PATIENTS RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIATION AND CANCER SURVIVORS. CLINICIANS SHOULD CONSIDER PRESCRIBING YOGA FOR THEIR PATIENTS SUFFERING WITH THESE TOXICITIES BY REFERRING THEM TO QUALIFIED YOGA PROFESSIONALS. MORE DEFINITIVE PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE FINDINGS AND TO INVESTIGATE OTHER TYPES, DOSES, AND DELIVERY MODES OF YOGA FOR TREATING CANCER-RELATED TOXICITIES IN PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
13 1575 27 MANAGING MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS RESULTING FROM TRAUMA THROUGH YOGA: A REVIEW. THERE ARE MANY AND VARIED TYPES OF TRAUMA. THE EXTENT TO WHICH TRAUMA INFLUENCES THE MENTAL HEALTH OF AN INDIVIDUAL DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF TRAUMA, AS WELL AS ON THE INDIVIDUAL'S COPING CAPABILITIES. OFTEN TRAUMA IS FOLLOWED BY DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND PTSD. AS THE PHARMACOLOGICAL REMEDIES FOR THESE CONDITIONS OFTEN HAVE UNDESIRABLE SIDE-EFFECTS, NONPHARMACOLOGICAL REMEDIES ARE THOUGHT OF AS A POSSIBLE ADD-ON TREATMENT. YOGA IS ONE SUCH MIND-BODY INTERVENTION. THIS PAPER COVERS ELEVEN STUDIES INDEXED IN PUBMED, IN WHICH MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS RESULTING FROM TRAUMA WERE MANAGED THROUGH YOGA INCLUDING MEDITATION. THE AIM WAS TO EVALUATE THE USE OF YOGA IN MANAGING TRAUMA-RELATED DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, PTSD AND PHYSIOLOGICAL STRESS FOLLOWING EXPOSURE TO NATURAL CALAMITIES, WAR, INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE, AND INCARCERATION IN A CORRECTIONAL FACILITY. AN ATTEMPT HAS ALSO BEEN MADE TO EXPLORE POSSIBLE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING BENEFITS SEEN. AS MOST OF THESE STUDIES WERE NOT DONE ON PERSONS EXPOSED TO TRAUMA THAT HAD PRACTICED YOGA, THIS IS A DEFINITE AREA FOR FURTHER RESEARCH.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
14 2129 15 THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA ON CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION: THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA ON CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (CRF) IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY AND/OR RADIATION THERAPY. LITERATURE SEARCH: RELEVANT ENGLISH AND CHINESE ARTICLES WERE RETRIEVED FROM MEDICAL DATABASES AND INCLUDED IN THIS ANALYSIS. STANDARDIZED CRITICAL APPRAISAL INSTRUMENTS FROM THE JOANNA BRIGGS INSTITUTE WERE ADOPTED FOR THE QUALITY ASSESSMENT. DATA EVALUATION: 16 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. SYNTHESIS: YOGA INTERVENTIONS HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT IN REDUCING CRF AMONG PATIENTS UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY AND/OR RADIATION THERAPY, BUT THE ADHERENCE TO YOGA WAS LOW. MIXED TYPES OF YOGA, IN ADDITION TO SUPERVISED AND SELF-PRACTICING STRATEGIES, WERE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED PATIENT ADHERENCE AND IMPROVED CRF. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: YOGA APPEARS TO BE A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE EXERCISE FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF CRF DURING CHEMOTHERAPY AND/OR RADIATION THERAPY; HOWEVER, ADDITIONAL HIGH-QUALITY STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO DEFINE AN OPTIMAL YOGA INTERVENTION STRATEGY.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
15  252 17 A YOGA PROGRAM FOR THE SYMPTOMS OF POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER IN VETERANS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF A YOGA PROGRAM AS AN ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY FOR IMPROVING POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) SYMPTOMS IN VETERANS WITH MILITARY-RELATED PTSD. VETERANS (N = 12) PARTICIPATED IN A 6 WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION HELD TWICE A WEEK. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PTSD HYPERAROUSAL SYMPTOMS AND OVERALL SLEEP QUALITY AS WELL AS DAYTIME DYSFUNCTION RELATED TO SLEEP. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE TOTAL PTSD, ANGER, OR QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOME SCORES. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THIS YOGA PROGRAM MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY FOR IMPROVING HYPERAROUSAL SYMPTOMS OF PTSD INCLUDING SLEEP QUALITY. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT THE YOGA PROGRAM IS ACCEPTABLE, FEASIBLE, AND THAT THERE IS GOOD ADHERENCE IN A VETERAN POPULATION.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
16 1525 20 IYENGAR YOGA AND THE USE OF PROPS FOR PEDIATRIC CHRONIC PAIN: A CASE STUDY. IYENGAR YOGA USES POSTURES AND PROPS TO SUPPORT THE BODY SO THAT PRACTITIONERS CAN ENGAGE IN POSES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE MORE DIFFICULT. THIS TYPE OF YOGA MAY BE USEFUL IN TREATING CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WHO HAVE CHRONIC PAIN AND DISABILITY. IN THIS CASE STUDY, THE AUTHORS DISCUSS A 14-Y-OLD GIRL WHO HAD TWO SURGERIES FOR GASTRO-ESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE (GERD) AND WHO HAD CONTINUED CHEST AND ABDOMINAL PAIN, AS WELL AS VOMITING, DIFFICULTY EATING, WEIGHT LOSS, AND ANXIETY. HAVING SIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIRED FUNCTIONING, SHE WAS UNABLE TO ATTEND SCHOOL, SLEEP, SOCIALIZE, OR EAT, AND SHE HAD BECOME WHEELCHAIR-BOUND. DESPITE EVALUATIONS AND TREATMENTS BY SPECIALISTS OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, HER SYMPTOMS HAD NOT IMPROVED. THIS CASE HISTORY DESCRIBES HOW THE AUTHORS USED A 4-MO TREATMENT OF IYENGAR YOGA TO HELP THE ADOLESCENT RESUME ACTIVITIES AND RE-ENGAGE WITH HER ENVIRONMENT. THE AUTHORS INTEND THIS REPORT TO STIMULATE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF THIS FORM OF TREATMENT FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH CHRONIC PAIN.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
17  421 20 BRIDGING BODY AND MIND: CONSIDERATIONS FOR TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA. INDIVIDUALS WHO SUFFER FROM TRAUMA-RELATED SYMPTOMS ARE A UNIQUE POPULATION THAT COULD BENEFIT FROM THE MIND-BODY PRACTICE OF YOGA-OR HAVE THEIR SYMPTOMS REACTIVATED BY IT, DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF YOGA. TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA (TIY), THAT IS, YOGA ADAPTED TO THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS WORKING TO OVERCOME TRAUMA, MAY AMELIORATE SYMPTOMS BY CREATING A SAFE, TAILORED PRACTICE FOR STUDENTS TO LEARN HOW TO RESPOND, RATHER THAN REACT, TO SYMPTOMS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. YOGA NOT THUS ADAPTED, ON THE OTHER HAND, MAY INCREASE REACTIVITY AND ACTIVATE SYMPTOMS SUCH AS HYPERAROUSAL OR DISSOCIATION. THIS ARTICLE REPORTS ON EXPERT INPUT ABOUT ADAPTING YOGA FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH TRAUMA, WITH SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR MILITARY POPULATIONS. ELEVEN EXPERTS, RECRUITED BASED ON LITERATURE REVIEW AND REFERRALS, WERE INTERVIEWED IN PERSON OR VIA TELEPHONE AND ASKED SEVEN QUESTIONS ABOUT TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA. VERBATIM TRANSCRIPTS WERE SUBJECTED TO OPEN-CODING THEMATIC ANALYSIS AND A PRIORI THEMES. FINDINGS REVEALED THAT TIY NEEDS TO EMPHASIZE BENEFICIAL PRACTICES (E.G., DIAPHRAGMATIC BREATH AND RESTORATIVE POSTURES), CONSIDER CONTRAINDICATIONS (E.G., AVOIDING SEQUENCES THAT OVERLY ENGAGE THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM), ADAPT TO LIMITATIONS AND CHALLENGES FOR TEACHING IN UNCONVENTIONAL SETTINGS (E.G., PRISONS, VA HOSPITALS), AND PROVIDE SPECIALIZED TRAINING AND PREPARATION (E.G., SPECIALIZED TIY CERTIFICATIONS, SELF-CARE OF INSTRUCTORS/THERAPISTS, ADAPTIONS FOR STUDENT NEEDS). TIY FOR VETERANS MUST ADDITIONALLY CONSIDER GENDER- AND CULTURE-RELATED BARRIERS, DIFFERING RELATIONSHIPS TO PAIN AND INJURY, AND MEDICATION AS A BARRIER TO PRACTICE.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
18 2813 25 YOGA TO TREAT NONSPECIFIC LOW BACK PAIN. LOW BACK PAIN IS COMMON AND POSES A CHALLENGE FOR CLINICIANS TO FIND EFFECTIVE TREATMENT TO PREVENT IT FROM BECOMING CHRONIC. CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON AN EMPLOYEE'S ABILITY TO REMAIN AN ACTIVE AND PRODUCTIVE MEMBER OF THE WORK FORCE DUE TO INCREASED ABSENTEEISM, DUTY RESTRICTIONS, OR PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS FROM PAIN. LOW BACK PAIN IS THE MOST COMMON CAUSE OF WORK-RELATED DISABILITY AMONG EMPLOYEES YOUNGER THAN 46 YEARS. ADVANCING TECHNOLOGY AND LESS INVASIVE SURGICAL PROCEDURES HAVE NOT IMPROVED OUTCOMES FOR EMPLOYEES WHO SUFFER FROM LOW BACK PAIN. MOST CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE SOME PAIN AND DYSFUNCTION AFTER CONVENTIONAL TREATMENTS SUCH AS INJECTIONS AND SURGERY. AN ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT THAT COULD REDUCE NONSPECIFIC CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN WOULD BENEFIT BOTH EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYERS. EXERCISING AND REMAINING ACTIVE ARE PART OF MOST GUIDELINES' ROUTINE CARE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT ARE NOT WELL DEFINED.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
19 2631 15 YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF INSOMNIA AMONG CANCER PATIENTS: EVIDENCE, MECHANISMS OF ACTION, AND CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS. UP TO 90% OF CANCER PATIENTS REPORT SYMPTOMS OF INSOMNIA DURING AND AFTER TREATMENT. SYMPTOMS OF INSOMNIA INCLUDE EXCESSIVE DAYTIME SLEEPINESS, DIFFICULTY FALLING ASLEEP, DIFFICULTY STAYING ASLEEP, AND WAKING UP TOO EARLY. INSOMNIA SYMPTOMS ARE AMONG THE MOST PREVALENT, DISTRESSING AND PERSISTENT CANCER- AND CANCER TREATMENT-RELATED TOXICITIES REPORTED BY PATIENTS, AND CAN BE SEVERE ENOUGH TO INCREASE CANCER MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. DESPITE THE UBIQUITY OF INSOMNIA SYMPTOMS, THEY ARE UNDER-SCREENED, UNDER-DIAGNOSED, AND UNDER-TREATED IN CANCER PATIENTS. WHEN INSOMNIA SYMPTOMS ARE IDENTIFIED, PROVIDERS ARE HESITANT TO PRESCRIBE, AND PATIENTS ARE HESITANT TO TAKE PHARMACEUTICALS DUE TO POLYPHARMACY CONCERNS. IN ADDITION, SLEEP MEDICATIONS DO NOT CURE INSOMNIA. YOGA IS A WELL-TOLERATED MODE OF EXERCISE WITH PROMISING EVIDENCE FOR ITS EFFICACY IN IMPROVING INSOMNIA SYMPTOMS AMONG CANCER PATIENTS. THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS EXISTING CLINICAL RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR TREATING INSOMNIA AMONG CANCER PATIENTS. THE ARTICLE ALSO PROVIDES CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRESCRIBING YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF INSOMNIA IN THIS POPULATION.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
20 1608 15 META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS ON YOGA, PSYCHOSOCIAL, AND MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE: WHAT INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS ARE RELATED TO HIGHER EFFICACY? CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (CRF) IS A BURDENSOME SEQUELA OF CANCER TREATMENTS. BESIDES EXERCISE, RECOMMENDED THERAPIES FOR CRF INCLUDE YOGA, PSYCHOSOCIAL, AND MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS. HOWEVER, INTERVENTIONS CONDUCTED VARY WIDELY, AND NOT ALL SHOW A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT. THIS META-ANALYSIS AIMED TO EXPLORE INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS RELATED TO GREATER REDUCTIONS IN CRF. WE INCLUDED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS PUBLISHED BEFORE OCTOBER 2021. STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCES WERE USED TO ASSESS INTERVENTION EFFICACY FOR CRF AND MULTIMODEL INFERENCE TO EXPLORE INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER EFFICACY. FOR THE META-ANALYSIS, WE INCLUDED 70 INTERVENTIONS (24 YOGA INTERVENTIONS, 31 PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTIONS, AND 15 MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS) WITH 6387 PARTICIPANTS. THE RESULTS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF YOGA, PSYCHOSOCIAL, AND MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS ON CRF BUT WITH HIGH HETEROGENEITY BETWEEN STUDIES. FOR YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS, NO PARTICULAR INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTIC WAS IDENTIFIED TO BE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR REDUCING CRF. REGARDING PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTIONS, A GROUP SETTING AND WORK ON COGNITION WERE RELATED TO HIGHER INTERVENTION EFFECTS ON CRF. THE RESULTS OF THIS META-ANALYSIS SUGGEST OPTIONS TO MAXIMIZE THE INTERVENTION EFFECTS OF PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTIONS FOR CRF. THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR CRF APPEAR TO BE INDEPENDENT OF THEIR DESIGN, ALTHOUGH THE LIMITED NUMBER OF STUDIES POINTS TO THE NEED FOR FURTHER RESEARCH.	2022

1  357 130 ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLE PRACTICES AMONG WORKING ADULTS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY FROM SINGAPORE. OBJECTIVES: THERE IS A PAUCITY OF RESEARCH ON THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN YOGIC BREATHING AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLE FACTORS IN WORKING ADULTS. ALSO, THERE IS VERY LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE FREQUENCY OF YOGIC BREATHING PRACTICE AND ITS BENEFITS. THE AUTHORS INVESTIGATED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA (SKY) FREQUENCY AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF LEADING A HEALTHIER LIFESTYLE AMONG PRACTITIONERS AND NONPRACTITIONERS. DESIGN: CROSS-SECTIONAL INVESTIGATION ON NON-SKY AND SKY PRACTITIONERS, SKY WAS CATEGORIZED INTO NON-, MONTHLY, WEEKLY, AND DAILY PRACTITIONERS. CONFOUNDING VARIABLES INCLUDED AGE, GENDER, ETHNICITY, MARITAL STATUS, AND EDUCATION LEVEL. A MULTIVARIATE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL WAS USED TO COMPARE PRACTICE FREQUENCIES WITH THE ODDS OF HAVING A HEALTHIER LIFESTYLE. SETTINGS: COMMUNITY CENTERS, COMMUNITY EVENTS, WORKPLACES, AND UNIVERSITIES THROUGHOUT SINGAPORE SUBJECTS: OF THE 531 WORKING ADULTS (54.8% FEMALE), 50.1% HAD A HEALTHIER LIFESTYLE >/= 4 HEALTHY LIFESTYLE FACTORS). OUTCOME MEASURE: HAVING A HEALTHIER LIFESTYLE WAS DEFINED AS HAVING >/= 4 HEALTHY LIFESTYLE FACTORS OUT OF SEVEN (SMOKING, ALCOHOL, DIET, EXERCISE, SLEEP, STRESS, AND WEIGHT). RESULTS: MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATED THAT THOSE WHO PRACTICED SKY >/= 4 DAYS/WEEK HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ODDS OF HAVING A HEALTHIER LIFESTYLE (ODDS RATIO = 3.62; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL = 2.10-6.23). THE P FOR TREND ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATED THAT AS THE FREQUENCY OF PRACTICE INCREASED THE LIKELIHOOD OF HAVING A HEALTHIER LIFESTYLE ALSO INCREASED ( P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: THE PRACTICE OF YOGIC BREATHING MAY PROMOTE A HEALTHIER LIFESTYLE IN WORKING ADULTS. FURTHER EXPERIMENTAL AND LONGITUDINAL INVESTIGATIONS ARE WARRANTED.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
2  628  34 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN VEGETARIAN AND OMNIVOROUS YOGA PRACTITIONERS-RESULTS OF A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SURVEY OF US ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS. BACKGROUND: TO EXAMINE THE PREVALENCE OF VEGETARIANISM AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS, AND TO EXPLORE DIFFERENCES AND SIMILARITIES BETWEEN YOGA PRACTITIONERS WHO ALSO USE VEGETARIAN DIET AND THOSE WHO DO NOT. DESIGN AND SETTING: USING CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA FROM THE 2012 NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY (NHIS) (N = 34,525), WEIGHTED FREQUENCIES FOR 12-MONTH PREVALENCE OF VEGETARIAN DIET USE AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS WERE ANALYZED. LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSES WERE USED TO ANALYZE SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL PREDICTORS OF VEGETARIAN DIET USE. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 1.7 MILLION US YOGA PRACTITIONERS HAVE USED A VEGETARIAN DIET IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS (8.3%), COMPARED TO 2.7 MILLION NON-YOGA PRACTITIONERS (1.3%). YOGA PRACTITIONERS WHO WERE AGED BETWEEN 30 AND 64 YEARS AS COMPARED TO BEING 29 YEARS OR YOUNGER WERE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE USED A VEGETARIAN DIET IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS; WHILE THOSE BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP (OR = 0.64), OVERWEIGHT (OR = 0.54), SMOKING (OR 0.64) OR HAVING PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE (OR = 0.59) WERE LESS LIKELY. VEGETARIAN DIET PRACTITIONERS MORE OFTEN INCLUDED MEDITATION AS PART OF THEIR YOGA PRACTICE AND MORE OFTEN CHOSE YOGA BECAUSE IT HAD A HOLISTIC FOCUS, AND WAS PERCEIVED TO TREAT THE CAUSE AND NOT THE SYMPTOMS OF THEIR HEALTH COMPLAINT. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA PRACTITIONERS FOLLOWING A VEGETARIAN DIET SEEM TO EMBRACE YOGA MORE AS A LIFESTYLE THAN AS A THERAPY.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
3 2054  56 THE ASSOCIATION OF SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA FREQUENCY WITH SLEEP QUALITY: A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY FROM SINGAPORE. PURPOSE: THERE IS A DEARTH OF EVIDENCE FOR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOGIC BREATHING AND SLEEP QUALITY. EVEN LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT PRACTICE FREQUENCY AND BENEFIT. WE INVESTIGATED THE ASSOCIATION OF SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA FREQUENCY WITH SLEEP QUALITY AMONGST ADULT PRACTITIONERS. METHODS: IN A CROSS-SECTIONAL INVESTIGATION ON ADULT PRACTITIONERS OF SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA IN SINGAPORE, THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI) WAS USED TO ASSESS SLEEP QUALITY. SLEEP QUALITY WAS EXAMINED ACROSS THREE CATEGORIES OF PRACTICE FREQUENCY (MONTHLY, WEEKLY, DAILY). A MULTIVARIATE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL WAS USED TO DETERMINE ASSOCIATION. RESULTS: OF 385 ADULTS (241 WOMEN), THE MEAN AGE (SD) WAS 42.5 (9.9) YEARS. IN TOTAL, 32% OF THE SAMPLE (N = 124) WAS IDENTIFIED AS HAVING POOR SQ. AFTER ADJUSTING FOR STUDY COVARIATES, INDEPENDENT ANALYSES REVEALED AN INVERSE ASSOCIATION FOR HIGHER FREQUENCY OF PRACTICE AND LOWER ODDS OF POOR SQ (OR = 0.52; 95% CI = 0.28-0.94). THE P FOR TREND WAS 0.03. CONCLUSION: THE PRACTICE OF YOGIC BREATHING MAY BENEFIT SLEEP QUALITY. FURTHER EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS ARE WARRANTED.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
4 1538  38 KNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDES TOWARD PRENATAL YOGA AMONG WOMEN WITH HIGH-RISK PREGNANCIES. THIS STUDY SOUGHT TO EVALUATE ATTITUDES AND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT PRENATAL YOGA AND TO INVESTIGATE BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO YOGA PARTICIPATION IN HIGH-RISK PREGNANT WOMEN RECEIVING PRENATAL CARE IN AN ACADEMIC TERTIARY CARE CENTER. WE SURVEYED A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF WOMEN RECEIVING PRENATAL CARE THROUGH THE MATERNAL-FETAL MEDICINE PRACTICE AT BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL. WE CLASSIFIED PARTICIPANTS AS YOGA-EXPERIENCED OR YOGA-NAIVE DEPENDING ON SELF-REPORT. WE COMPARED DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS USING THE APPROPRIATE NONPARAMETRIC TESTS AND COMPARED BIVARIATE ODDS RATIOS FOR SURVEY RESULTS USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION. OF THE 100 RESPONDENTS, 53% HAD PRACTICED YOGA PREVIOUSLY. WOMEN WITH YOGA EXPERIENCE WERE OLDER (AGE 34.9 +/- 5.6 VS. 31.0 +/- 6.0 YEARS, P = 0.004), MORE LIKELY TO BE COLLEGE GRADUATES (94% VS. 68%, P = 0.002), AND MORE LIKELY TO BE WHITE (77% VS. 47%, P = 0.002) THAN WOMEN WITHOUT PREVIOUS YOGA EXPERIENCE. PREVIOUS YOGA EXPERIENCE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH PARTICIPANT AGREEMENT THAT YOGA WAS SAFE DURING THEIR CURRENT PREGNANCY (ODDS RATIO 5.9, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL 1.9-17.7). OF THE WOMEN SURVEYED, 56% AGREED THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO ATTEND A PRENATAL YOGA CLASS. IN A MULTIVARIATE MODEL INCLUDING AGE, RACE, AND EDUCATION, PREVIOUS YOGA EXPERIENCE WAS THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR ASSOCIATED WITH WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN PRENATAL YOGA CLASSES DURING CURRENT PREGNANCY (ODDS RATIO 3.1, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL 1.1-8.6). PRIOR YOGA EXPERIENCE WAS THE STRONGEST PREDICTOR OF WILLINGNESS TO ATTEND A PRENATAL YOGA CLASS IN OUR POPULATION. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT WOMEN WITH HIGH-RISK PREGNANCIES WHO MAY BENEFIT FROM PRENATAL YOGA INTERVENTIONS BUT LACK PRIOR YOGA EXPERIENCE MAY NEED ADDITIONAL EDUCATION TO FACILITATE PARTICIPATION.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
5 1445  39 INCREASING TREND OF YOGA PRACTICE AMONG U.S. ADULTS FROM 2002 TO 2017. INTRODUCTION: BENEFITS, RISKS, AND THE INCREASING POPULARITY OF YOGA USE WARRANT ASSESSING YOGA PRACTICE PREVALENCE AND USERS' PROFILES. THIS STUDY DESCRIBES TRENDS IN YOGA PRACTICE EXCLUSIVELY AMONG AMERICAN ADULTS FROM 2002 TO 2017, COMPARES THE PROFILE OF YOGA USERS, AND IDENTIFIES FACTORS RELATED TO YOGA USE OVER TIME. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS STUDY IS A SECONDARY ANALYSIS DONE IN 2019 AND 2020 USING THE NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY (NHIS) 2002, 2007, 2012, AND 2017 DATA. POPULATION WEIGHTS WERE USED TO OBTAIN STATISTICALLY ACCURATE ESTIMATES OF YOGA USE PREVALENCE FOR THE U.S. POPULATION. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS WERE USED TO PROFILE THE SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND HEALTH-RELATED CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA USERS. MULTIVARIABLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION WAS USED TO IDENTIFY FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA USE IN EACH COHORT DEFINED BY THE NHIS YEAR. RESULTS: YOGA PRACTICE PREVALENCE NEARLY TRIPLED FROM 5.1% IN 2002 TO 13.7% IN 2017 (WEIGHTED ESTIMATE 10,386,456 AND 32,761,194 AMERICAN ADULTS, RESPECTIVELY). TYPICAL YOGA USERS WERE YOUNG NON-HISPANIC SINGLE WHITE FEMALE ADULTS WITH BACHELOR OR HIGHER EDUCATION AND HEALTH INSURANCE, AND RESIDED IN THE WEST REGION OF THE UNITED STATES. YOGA USE PATTERN CHANGE OVER TIME WAS SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO ONLY YOUNGER AGE (P < 0.001) BUT NOT TO OTHER SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC OR HEALTH-RELATED FACTORS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA HAS GAINED INCREASING POPULARITY IN THE PAST TWO DECADES AMONG AMERICAN ADULTS, WITH YOUNGER ADULTS BEING THE DRIVING FORCE. YOGA APPEARS TO BE ADOPTED FOR GENERAL WELL-BEING OR PREVENTION MORE THAN FOR SPECIFIC DISEASE TREATMENT. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD EVALUATE HOW YOGA CAN BE EFFECTIVELY AND SAFELY INTEGRATED INTO PREVENTIVE MEDICINE STRATEGIES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
6  291  36 ADVERSE EFFECTS OF YOGA: A NATIONAL CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY. BACKGROUND: WHILE YOGA IS INCREASINGLY USED FOR HEALTH PURPOSES, ITS SAFETY HAS BEEN QUESTIONED. THE AIM OF THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY WAS TO ANALYZE YOGA-ASSOCIATED ADVERSE EFFECTS AND THEIR CORRELATES. METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL ANONYMOUS NATIONAL ONLINE SURVEY AMONG GERMAN YOGA PRACTITIONERS (N = 1702; 88.9% FEMALE; 47.2 +/- 10.8 YEARS) WAS CONDUCTED FROM JANUARY TO JUNE 2016. PARTICIPANTS WERE QUERIED REGARDING THEIR YOGA PRACTICE, I.E. YOGA STYLES USED, LENGTH AND INTENSITY OF YOGA PRACTICE, PRACTICE PATTERNS, AND WHETHER THEY HAD EXPERIENCED ACUTE OR CHRONIC ADVERSE EFFECTS OF THEIR YOGA PRACTICE. INDEPENDENT PREDICTORS OF ACUTE OR CHRONIC ADVERSE EFFECTS WERE IDENTIFIED USING MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSES. RESULTS: ASHTANGA YOGA (15.7%), TRADITIONAL HATHA YOGA (14.2%), AND SIVANANDA YOGA (22.4%) WERE THE MOST COMMONLY USED YOGA STYLES. 364 (21.4%) YOGA USERS REPORTED 702 ACUTE ADVERSE EFFECTS, OCCURRING AFTER A MEAN OF 7.6 +/- 8.0 YEARS OF YOGA PRACTICE. THE MOST COMMONLY REPORTED YOGA PRACTICES THAT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH ACUTE ADVERSE EFFECTS WERE HAND-, SHOULDER- AND HEAD STANDS (29.4%). USING VINIYOGA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A DECREASED RISK OF ACUTE ADVERSE EFFECTS; PRACTICING ONLY BY SELF-STUDY WITHOUT SUPERVISION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER RISK. ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY-THREE PARTICIPANTS (10.2%) REPORTED 239 CHRONIC ADVERSE EFFECTS. THE RISK OF CHRONIC ADVERSE EFFECTS WAS HIGHER IN PARTICIPANTS WITH CHRONIC ILLNESSES AND THOSE PRACTICING ONLY BY SELF-STUDY WITHOUT SUPERVISION. MOST REPORTED ADVERSE EFFECTS CONCERNED THE MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM. 76.9% OF ACUTE CASES, AND 51.6% OF CHRONIC CASES REACHED FULL RECOVERY. ON AVERAGE 0.60 INJURIES (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL = 0.51-0.71) PER 1000 H OF PRACTICE WERE REPORTED, WITH POWER YOGA USERS REPORTING THE HIGHEST RATE (1.50 INJURIES PER 1000 H; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL = 0.98-3.15). CONCLUSIONS: ONE IN FIVE ADULT YOGA USERS REPORTED AT LEAST ONE ACUTE ADVERSE EFFECT IN THEIR YOGA PRACTICE, AND ONE IN TEN REPORTED AT LEAST ONE CHRONIC ADVERSE EFFECT, MAINLY MUSCULOSKELETAL EFFECTS. ADVERSE EFFECTS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HAND-, SHOULDER- AND HEAD STANDS; AND WITH YOGA SELF-STUDY WITHOUT SUPERVISION. MORE THAN THREE QUARTERS OF OF CASES REACHED FULL RECOVERY. BASED ON THE OVERALL INJURY RATE PER 1000 PRACTICE HOURS, YOGA APPEARS TO BE AS SAFE OR SAFER WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER EXERCISE TYPES.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
7 1787  38 PREFERENCE AND EXPECTATION FOR TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF ONCE- VS TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. BACKGROUND: IN STUDIES INVOLVING NONPHARMACOLOGICAL COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE INTERVENTIONS, PARTICIPANT BLINDING IS VERY DIFFICULT. PARTICIPANT EXPECTATIONS MAY AFFECT PERCEIVED BENEFIT OF THERAPY. IN STUDIES OF YOGA AS TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PATIENT EXPECTATIONS AND PREFERENCES ON OUTCOMES. THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY BASELINE PREDICTORS OF PREFERENCE AND TO DETERMINE IF EXPECTATIONS AND PREFERENCES FOR DIFFERENT DOSES OF YOGA AFFECT BACK-RELATED FUNCTION AND LOW BACK PAIN INTENSITY. METHODS: THIS WAS A SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS OF A 12-WEEK RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING ONCE-WEEKLY VS TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA FOR TREATMENT OF CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN IN 93 ADULTS FROM A PREDOMINANTLY LOW-INCOME MINORITY POPULATION. AT BASELINE, PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED ABOUT BACK FUNCTION, BACK PAIN, TREATMENT EXPECTATIONS, AND TREATMENT PREFERENCES. WE CREATED A VARIABLE "CONCORDANCE" TO DESCRIBE THE MATCHING OF PARTICIPANT PREFERENCE TO RANDOMIZED TREATMENT. OUR OUTCOME VARIABLES WERE CHANGE IN BACK FUNCTION AND PAIN INTENSITY AFTER 12 WEEKS OF YOGA INSTRUCTION. WE PERFORMED LOGISTIC REGRESSION TO IDENTIFY PREDICTORS OF PREFERENCE FOR ONCE- OR TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA INSTRUCTION. WE CREATED LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS TO IDENTIFY INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN EXPECTATIONS, PREFERENCE, CONCORDANCE, AND OUTCOMES. RESULTS: WORSE BACK FUNCTION AT BASELINE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH 20% HIGHER ODDS OF PREFERRING TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA (OR 1.2, CI 1.1, 1.3). INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGHER EXPECTATION SCORES FOR TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA HAD 90% HIGHER ODDS OF PREFERRING TWICE-WEEKLY VS ONCE-WEEKLY YOGA (OR 1.9, CI 1.3, 2.7). INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGHER EXPECTATION SCORES FOR ONCE-WEEKLY YOGA HAD 40% LESS ODDS OF PREFERRING TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA (OR 0.6, CI 0.5, 0.9). AFTER CONTROLLING FOR BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS, WE FOUND NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TREATMENT OUTCOMES, PREFERENCE, EXPECTATION SCORES, OR CONCORDANCE. CONCLUSION: IN A POPULATION OF PREDOMINANTLY LOW-INCOME MINORITY PARTICIPANTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN, WORSE BACK FUNCTION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH PREFERENCE FOR MORE FREQUENT YOGA CLASSES. THOSE WHO PREFERRED MORE YOGA CLASSES HAD HIGHER EXPECTATIONS FOR THOSE CLASSES. TWELVE-WEEK CHANGE IN BACK PAIN INTENSITY AND BACK FUNCTION WERE NOT AFFECTED BY DOSING PREFERENCE, EXPECTATION SCORE, OR CONCORDANCE. MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO BETTER MEASURE AND QUANTIFY PREFERENCE, EXPECTATIONS, AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO OUTCOMES IN YOGA RESEARCH.	2015	

8 2055  59 THE ASSOCIATION OF SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA WITH HAPPINESS: A CASE-CONTROL OBSERVATIONAL STUDY FROM SINGAPORE. HAPPINESS IS A COMPLEX SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO SOCIETAL PROGRESS. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA (SKY) AND SUBJECTIVE HAPPINESS IN SINGAPORE. SUBJECTIVE HAPPINESS DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE (N = 733) COMPRISED OF 2 GROUPS: SKY (N = 385) AND NON-SKY (N = 348) PRACTITIONERS. SKY WAS CATEGORIZED INTO NON-, MONTHLY, WEEKLY, AND DAILY PRACTITIONERS AND HAPPINESS WAS CATEGORIZED INTO LOWER, MIDDLE AND HIGHER TERTILE GROUPS. CONFOUNDING VARIABLES INCLUDED AGE, GENDER, ETHNICITY, MARITAL STATUS, EDUCATION LEVEL, BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), SMOKING STATUS, ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND SELF-REPORTED HEALTH. DAILY SKY PARTICIPATION WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH A 2-FOLD HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF BEING HAPPIER IN A MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION ANALYSIS. THE TREND ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT AS SKY FREQUENCY INCREASES, THE ODDS OF BEING HAPPIER INCREASES. THESE FINDINGS HELP GENERATE THE HYPOTHESIS THAT YOGIC BREATHING MAY PROMOTE HAPPINESS. FURTHER EXPERIMENTAL AND PROSPECTIVE INVESTIGATIONS ARE WARRANTED.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
9  339  27 ARE SCREENING BY YOGA INSTRUCTORS AND THEIR PRACTICE PATTERNS IMPORTANT TO PREVENT INJURIES IN YOGA CLIENTS? BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: LITTLE INFORMATION EXISTS REGARDING THE ASSOCIATION OF YOGA-RELATED INJURIES WITH YOGA INSTRUCTOR (YI) PRACTICE PATTERNS. THEREFORE, THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY EXAMINED THE SCREENING AND PRACTICE CHARACTERISTICS OF YI AND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH YOGA-RELATED INJURIES. METHODS AND MATERIALS: YI FROM NORTHEASTERN US COMPLETED A CUSTOMIZED WEB-BASED 57-ITEM QUESTIONNAIRE. RESULTS: THE RESPONSE RATE OF OUR QUESTIONNAIRE WAS 46%. IN THIS STUDY, ONLY 8.8% OF THE YI REPORTED PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE SCREENING AND 33.7% OF THE PARTICIPANTS DID MEDICAL SCREENINGS WITH THEIR CLIENTS. A BINOMIAL LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS WITH THE ABOVE VARIABLES REVEALED THAT ADHERENCE TO TRAINING BY YI (P = 0.031) AND THE USE OF SUN SALUTATIONS (P = 0.002) PREDICTED LOWER YOGA-RELATED INJURIES IN CLIENTS REPORTED BY YI. CONCLUSIONS: REDUCTION IN CLIENT YOGA-RELATED INJURIES WAS PREDICTED BY YI ADHERING TO THEIR TRAINING AND PERFORMING SUN SALUTATIONS IN THEIR CLASSES.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
10 1699  38 PARTICIPANT CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH SYMPTOMATIC IMPROVEMENT FROM YOGA FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. CONTEXT: STUDIES SUGGEST THAT YOGA IS EFFECTIVE FOR MODERATE TO SEVERE CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) IN DIVERSE PREDOMINANTLY LOWER SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS POPULATIONS. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH BENEFIT FROM THE YOGA INTERVENTION. OBJECTIVE: IDENTIFY FACTORS AT BASELINE INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER EFFICACY AMONG PARTICIPANTS IN A STUDY OF YOGA FOR CLBP. DESIGN: FROM SEPTEMBER-DECEMBER 2011, A 12-WEEK RANDOMIZED DOSING TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED COMPARING WEEKLY VS. TWICE-WEEKLY 75-MINUTE HATHA YOGA CLASSES FOR 95 PREDOMINANTLY LOW-INCOME MINORITY ADULTS WITH NONSPECIFIC CLBP. PARTICIPANT CHARACTERISTICS COLLECTED AT BASELINE WERE USED TO DETERMINE FACTORS BEYOND TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT (REPORTED IN THE INITIAL STUDY) THAT PREDICTED OUTCOME. WE USED BIVARIATE TESTING TO IDENTIFY BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENT IN FUNCTION AND PAIN, AND INCLUDED SELECT FACTORS IN A MULTIVARIATE LINEAR REGRESSION. SETTING: RECRUITMENT AND CLASSES OCCURRED IN AN ACADEMIC SAFETY-NET HOSPITAL AND FIVE AFFILIATED COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS IN BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS. PARTICIPANTS: NINETY-FIVE ADULTS WITH NONSPECIFIC CLBP, AGES RANGING FROM 20-64 (MEAN 48) YEARS; 72 WOMEN AND 23 MEN. OUTCOME MEASURES: PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE CHANGES IN BACK-RELATED FUNCTION (MODIFIED ROLAND-MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE, RMDQ; 0-23) AND MEAN LOW BACK PAIN INTENSITY (0-10) IN THE PREVIOUS WEEK, FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 12. RESULTS: ADJUSTING FOR GROUP ASSIGNMENT, BASELINE RMDQ, AGE, AND GENDER, FOREIGN NATIONALITY AND LOWER BASELINE SF36 PHYSICAL COMPONENT SCORE (PCS) WERE INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENT IN RMDQ. GREATER THAN HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION LEVEL, CLBP LESS THAN 1 YEAR, AND LOWER BASELINE SF36 PCS WERE INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENT IN PAIN INTENSITY. OTHER DEMOGRAPHICS INCLUDING RACE, INCOME, GENDER, BMI, AND USE OF PAIN MEDICATIONS WERE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH EITHER OUTCOME. CONCLUSIONS: POOR PHYSICAL HEALTH AT BASELINE IS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER IMPROVEMENT FROM YOGA IN BACK-RELATED FUNCTION AND PAIN. RACE, INCOME, AND BODY MASS INDEX DO NOT AFFECT THE POTENTIAL FOR A PERSON WITH LOW BACK PAIN TO EXPERIENCE BENEFIT FROM YOGA.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
11 1785  40 PREDICTORS OF YOGA USE AMONG INTERNAL MEDICINE PATIENTS. BACKGROUND: YOGA SEEMS TO BE AN EFFECTIVE MEANS TO COPE WITH A VARIETY OF INTERNAL MEDICINE CONDITIONS. WHILE CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA USERS HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED IN THE GENERAL POPULATION, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT PREDICTORS OF YOGA USE AND BARRIERS TO YOGA USE IN INTERNAL MEDICINE PATIENTS. THE AIM OF THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYSIS WAS TO IDENTIFY SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC, CLINICAL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PREDICTORS OF YOGA USE AMONG INTERNAL MEDICINE PATIENTS. METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED AMONG ALL PATIENTS BEING REFERRED TO A DEPARTMENT OF INTERNAL AND INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DURING A 3-YEAR PERIOD. IT WAS ASSESSED WHETHER PATIENTS HAD EVER USED YOGA FOR THEIR PRIMARY MEDICAL COMPLAINT, THE PERCEIVED BENEFIT, AND THE PERCEIVED HARM OF YOGA PRACTICE. POTENTIAL PREDICTORS OF YOGA USE INCLUDING SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, HEALTH BEHAVIOR, INTERNAL MEDICINE DIAGNOSIS, GENERAL HEALTH STATUS, MENTAL HEALTH, SATISFACTION WITH HEALTH, AND HEALTH LOCUS OF CONTROL WERE ASSESSED; AND ASSOCIATIONS WITH YOGA USE WERE TESTED USING MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS. ODDS RATIOS (OR) WITH 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CI) WERE CALCULATED FOR SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS. RESULTS: OF 2486 PARTICIPANTS, 303 (12.19%) REPORTED HAVING USED YOGA FOR THEIR PRIMARY MEDICAL COMPLAINT. OF THOSE, 184 (60.73%) REPORTED BENEFITS AND 12 (3.96%) REPORTED HARMS DUE TO YOGA PRACTICE. COMPARED TO YOGA NON-USERS, YOGA USERS WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE 50-64 YEARS OLD (OR = 1.45; 95%CI = 1.05-2.01; P = 0.025); FEMALE (OR = 2.45; 95%CI = 1.45-4.02; P < 0.001); AND COLLEGE GRADUATES (OR = 1.61; 95%CI = 1.14-2.27; P = 0.007); AND LESS LIKELY TO CURRENTLY SMOKE (OR = 0.61; 95%CI = 0.39-0.96; P = 0.031). MANIFEST ANXIETY (OR = 1.47; 95%CI = 1.06-2.04; P = 0.020); AND HIGH INTERNAL HEALTH LOCUS OF CONTROL (OR = 1.92; 95%CI = 1.38-2.67; P < 0.001) WERE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA USE, WHILE HIGH EXTERNAL-FATALISTIC HEALTH LOCUS OF CONTROL (OR = 0.66; 95%CI = 0.47-0.92; P = 0.014) WAS NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA USE. CONCLUSION: YOGA WAS USED FOR THEIR PRIMARY MEDICAL COMPLAINT BY 12.19% OF AN INTERNAL INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE PATIENT POPULATION AND WAS COMMONLY PERCEIVED AS BENEFICIAL. YOGA USE WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH THE PATIENTS' SPECIFIC DIAGNOSIS BUT WITH SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS, MENTAL HEALTH, AND HEALTH LOCUS OF CONTROL. TO IMPROVE ADHERENCE TO YOGA PRACTICE, IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED THAT MALE, YOUNGER, AND ANXIOUS PATIENTS AND THOSE WITH LOW INTERNAL HEALTH LOCUS OF CONTROL MIGHT BE LESS INTRINSICALLY MOTIVATED TO START YOGA.	2013	
                                                                          
12  362  30 ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN YOGA PRACTICE AND JOINT PROBLEMS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY AMONG 9151 AUSTRALIAN WOMEN. YOGA EXERCISES HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH JOINT PROBLEMS RECENTLY, INDICATING THAT YOGA PRACTICE MIGHT BE POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS FOR JOINT HEALTH. THIS STUDY AIMED TO ANALYSE WHETHER REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FREQUENCY OF JOINT PROBLEMS IN UPPER MIDDLE-AGED AUSTRALIAN WOMEN. WOMEN AGED 62-67 YEARS FROM THE AUSTRALIAN LONGITUDINAL STUDY ON WOMEN'S HEALTH (ALSWH) WERE QUESTIONED IN 2013 WHETHER THEY EXPERIENCED REGULAR JOINT PAIN OR PROBLEMS IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS AND WHETHER THEY REGULARLY PRACTICED YOGA. ASSOCIATIONS OF JOINT PROBLEMS WITH YOGA PRACTICE WERE ANALYSED USING CHI-SQUARED TESTS AND MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELLING. OF 9151 WOMEN, 29.8% REPORTED REGULAR PROBLEMS WITH STIFF OR PAINFUL JOINTS, AND 15.2, 11.9, 18.1 AND 15.9% REPORTED REGULAR PROBLEMS WITH SHOULDERS, HIPS, KNEES AND FEET, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS. YOGA WAS PRACTICED SOMETIMES BY 10.1% AND OFTEN BY 8.4% OF WOMEN. PRACTICING YOGA WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH UPPER OR LOWER LIMB JOINT PROBLEMS. NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN YOGA PRACTICE AND JOINT PROBLEMS HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED. FURTHER STUDIES ARE WARRANTED FOR CONCLUSIVE JUDGEMENT OF BENEFITS AND SAFETY OF YOGA IN RELATION TO JOINT PROBLEMS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
13  473  31 CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA USERS: RESULTS OF A NATIONAL SURVEY. BACKGROUND: THERE ARE LIMITED DATA ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA USERS IN THE U.S. OBJECTIVE: TO CHARACTERIZE YOGA USERS, MEDICAL REASONS FOR USE, PERCEPTIONS OF HELPFULNESS, AND DISCLOSURE OF USE TO MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. METHODS: UTILIZING CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY DATA FROM THE 2002 NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY (NHIS) ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE SUPPLEMENT (N = 31044), WE EXAMINED CORRELATES OF YOGA USE FOR HEALTH. THE ESTIMATED PREVALENCE FROM 2002 NHIS OF YOGA FOR HEALTH WAS 5.1% CORRESPONDING TO OVER 10 MILLION ADULTS. RESULTS: IN 2002, YOGA USERS WERE PREDOMINATELY CAUCASIAN (85%) AND FEMALE (76%) WITH A MEAN AGE OF 39.5 YEARS. COMPARED TO NON-YOGA USERS, YOGA USERS WERE MORE LIKELY FEMALE (OR 3.76, 95% CI 3.11-4.33); LESS LIKELY BLACK THAN WHITE (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.53-0.80); TENDED TO BE YOUNGER; AND MORE LIKELY COLLEGE EDUCATED (OR 2.70, 95% CI 2.37-3.08). MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.42-1.83), MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.22-1.67), SEVERE SPRAINS IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.22-1.81), AND ASTHMA (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05-1.54) WERE INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER YOGA USE, WHILE HYPERTENSION (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64-0.95) AND CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.48-1.00) WERE ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER USE. YOGA WAS MOST COMMONLY USED TO TREAT MUSCULOSKELETAL OR MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS, AND MOST USERS REPORTED YOGA TO BE HELPFUL FOR THESE CONDITIONS. A MAJORITY OF YOGA USERS (61%) FELT YOGA WAS IMPORTANT IN MAINTAINING HEALTH, THOUGH ONLY 25% DISCLOSED YOGA PRACTICE TO THEIR MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL. CONCLUSIONS: WE FOUND THAT YOGA USERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE WHITE, FEMALE, YOUNG AND COLLEGE EDUCATED. YOGA USERS REPORT BENEFIT FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS AND MENTAL HEALTH, INDICATING THAT FURTHER RESEARCH ON THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT AND/OR PREVENTION OF THESE CONDITIONS IS WARRANTED.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
14 1440  36 INCREASED HATHA YOGA EXPERIENCE PREDICTS LOWER BODY MASS INDEX AND REDUCED MEDICATION USE IN WOMEN OVER 45 YEARS. BACKGROUND: YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE MANY SHORT-TERM HEALTH BENEFITS, BUT LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE BENEFITS ACCRUE OVER A LONG TIME FRAME OR WITH FREQUENT PRACTICE. AIMS: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) AND MEDICATION USE IN A SAMPLE OF FEMALE YOGA PRACTITIONERS OVER 45 YEARS VARIED ACCORDING TO THE LENGTH AND FREQUENCY OF YOGA PRACTICE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE ADMINISTERED ONLINE SURVEYS TO 211 FEMALE YOGA PRACTITIONERS AGED 45 TO 80 YEARS. WE USED REGRESSION ANALYSES TO EVALUATE THE RELATIONSHIP OF EXTENT OF YOGA EXPERIENCE TO BOTH BMI AND MEDICATION USE AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR AGE AND LIFESTYLE FACTORS. WE ALSO CONDUCTED COMPARISONS WITH 182 MATCHED CONTROLS. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS HAD PRACTICED YOGA FOR AS LONG AS 50 YEARS AND FOR UP TO 28 HOURS PER WEEK. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT INVERSE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN YOGA EXPERIENCE AND BOTH BMI AND MEDICATION LOAD. THESE SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS REMAINED AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR AGE AND LIFESTYLE FACTORS. WHEN WE COMPUTED YOGA EXPERIENCE IN TERMS OF TOTAL CALENDAR YEARS, WITHOUT ACCOUNTING FOR HOURS OF PRACTICE, SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS DID NOT REMAIN. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO OBESITY IN THE 49 PARTICIPANTS WITH MORE THAN 25 YEARS OF YOGA PRACTICE. YOGA PRACTITIONERS WERE LESS LIKELY THAN NON-PRACTITIONERS TO USE MEDICATION FOR METABOLIC SYNDROME, MOOD DISORDERS, INFLAMMATION, AND PAIN. CONCLUSIONS: A LONG-TERM YOGA PRACTICE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LITTLE OR NO OBESITY IN A NON-PROBABILITY SAMPLE OF WOMEN OVER 45 YEARS. RELATIONSHIPS SHOWED A DOSE-RESPONSE EFFECT, WITH INCREASED YOGA EXPERIENCE PREDICTING LOWER BMI AND REDUCED MEDICATION USE.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
15 2374  43 WHICH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN PATIENTS RESPOND FAVORABLY TO YOGA, PHYSICAL THERAPY, AND A SELF-CARE BOOK? RESPONDER ANALYSES FROM A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. PURPOSE: TO IDENTIFY BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS OF ADULTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) THAT PREDICT RESPONSE (I.E., A CLINICALLY IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENT) AND/OR MODIFY TREATMENT EFFECT ACROSS THREE NONPHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS. DESIGN: SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: ACADEMIC SAFETY NET HOSPITAL AND SEVEN FEDERALLY QUALIFIED COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS. SUBJECTS: ADULTS WITH CLBP (N = 299). METHODS: WE REPORT PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS THAT WERE PREDICTORS OF RESPONSE AND/OR MODIFIED TREATMENT EFFECT ACROSS THREE 12-WEEK TREATMENTS: YOGA, PHYSICAL THERAPY [PT], AND A SELF-CARE BOOK. USING PRESELECTED CHARACTERISTICS, WE USED LOGISTIC REGRESSION TO IDENTIFY PREDICTORS OF "RESPONSE," DEFINED AS A >/=30% IMPROVEMENT IN THE ROLAND MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE. THEN, USING "RESPONSE" AS OUR OUTCOME, WE IDENTIFIED BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS THAT WERE TREATMENT EFFECT MODIFIERS BY TESTING FOR STATISTICAL INTERACTION (P < 0.05) ACROSS TWO COMPARISONS: 1) YOGA-OR-PT VS SELF-CARE AND 2) YOGA VS PT. RESULTS: OVERALL, 39% (116/299) OF PARTICIPANTS WERE RESPONDERS, WITH MORE RESPONDERS IN THE YOGA-OR-PT GROUP (42%) THAN THE SELF-CARE (23%) GROUP. THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN PROPORTION RESPONDING TO YOGA (48%) VS PT (37%, ODDS RATIO [OR] = 1.5, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL = 0.88 - 2.6). PREDICTORS OF RESPONSE INCLUDED HAVING MORE THAN A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION, A HIGHER INCOME, EMPLOYMENT, FEW DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, LOWER PERCEIVED STRESS, FEW WORK-RELATED FEAR AVOIDANCE BELIEFS, HIGH PAIN SELF-EFFICACY, AND BEING A NONSMOKER. EFFECT MODIFIERS INCLUDED USE OF PAIN MEDICATION AND FEAR AVOIDANCE BELIEFS RELATED TO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (BOTH P = 0.02 FOR INTERACTION). WHEN COMPARING YOGA OR PT WITH SELF-CARE, A GREATER PROPORTION WERE RESPONDERS AMONG THOSE USING PAIN MEDS (OR = 5.3), WHICH DIFFERED FROM THOSE NOT TAKING PAIN MEDS (OR = 0.94) AT BASELINE. WE ALSO FOUND GREATER TREATMENT RESPONSE AMONG THOSE WITH LOWER (OR = 7.0), BUT NOT HIGH (OR = 1.3), FEAR AVOIDANCE BELIEFS AROUND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. CONCLUSIONS: OUR FINDINGS REVEALED IMPORTANT SUBGROUPS FOR WHOM REFERRAL TO YOGA OR PT MAY IMPROVE CLBP OUTCOMES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
16  365  32 ASSOCIATIONS OF YOGA PRACTICE, HEALTH STATUS, AND HEALTH BEHAVIOR AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS IN GERMANY-RESULTS OF A NATIONAL CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY. BACKGROUND: WHILE YOGA CAN IMPROVE HEALTH-RELATED VARIABLES AND HEALTH BEHAVIOR, DIFFERENT YOGA STYLES AND PRACTICE COMPONENTS APPEAR TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC HEALTH OUTCOMES. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN YOGA USE, HEALTH, AND HEALTH BEHAVIORS ACROSS DIFFERENT YOGA STYLES. METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL ANONYMOUS ONLINE SURVEY (N = 1,702; 88.9% FEMALE; 93.3% GERMAN NATIONALITY; MEAN AGE 47.2 +/- 10.8 YEARS; 58.2% YOGA TEACHERS) ASSESSED YOGA PRACTICE CHARACTERISTICS, HEALTH-RELATED VARIABLES AND HEALTH BEHAVIOR. THE SURVEY WAS DISTRIBUTED IN GERMANY ONLY BUT NOT LIMITED TO GERMAN PARTICIPANTS. RESULTS: ASHTANGA YOGA (15.7%), HATHA YOGA (14.2%), AND SIVANANDA YOGA (22.4%) WERE THE MOST COMMONLY PRACTICED YOGA STYLES; PARTICIPANTS PRACTICED FOR A MEAN OF 12.7 +/- 10.0 YEARS. MOST PARTICIPANTS HAD GOOD TO EXCELLENT (96.1%) OVERALL HEALTH; 87.7% REPORTED IMPROVED HEALTH SINCE STARTING YOGA. CONTROLLING FOR SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL FACTORS, HEALTH-RELATED VARIABLES WERE MAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH FREQUENCY OF YOGA POSTURES PRACTICE (P < 0.05), HEALTH BEHAVIORS ALSO WITH YOGA PHILOSOPHY STUDY (P < 0.05). THE VARIOUS YOGA STYLES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC HEALTH-RELATED VARIABLES (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: YOGA PRACTITIONERS GENERALLY HAVE A GOOD OVERALL HEALTH AND A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE. WHILE HEALTH VARIABLES ARE MAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH PRACTICE OF YOGA POSTURES, HEALTH BEHAVIORS ARE ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH THE STUDY OF YOGA PHILOSOPHY. YOGA INTERVENTIONS TARGETING PREVENTION OR HEALTH PROMOTION SHOULD INCLUDE YOGA PHILOSOPHY TO MODIFY HEALTH BEHAVIORS. THE SPECIFIC YOGA STYLE EMPLOYED MAY ALSO INFLUENCE HEALTH OUTCOMES.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
17 1786  51 PREDICTORS OF YOGA USE AMONG PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. OBJECTIVE: EMERGING RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT YOGA MAY BE BENEFICIAL FOR REDUCING SYMPTOMS AND IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. HOWEVER, VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WHO USE YOGA; THUS, THIS STUDY SEEKS TO IDENTIFY THE SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA USERS AMONG THIS POPULATION. DESIGN: A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY STUDY WAS CONDUCTED. SETTING: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT AN OUTPATIENT BREAST ONCOLOGY CLINIC AT A LARGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL. PARTICIPANTS: THREE HUNDRED POSTMENOPAUSAL BREAST CANCER PATIENTS CURRENTLY RECEIVING AROMATASE INHIBITORS WERE INCLUDED IN THIS STUDY. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: SELF-REPORTED USE OF YOGA FOLLOWING THE CANCER DIAGNOSIS WAS COLLECTED ALONG WITH SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL DATA. MULTIVARIATE LOGISTIC REGRESSION WAS USED TO IDENTIFY INDEPENDENT PREDICTORS OF YOGA USE AMONG BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. RESULTS: OF 300 PARTICIPANTS, 53 (17.7%) REPORTED HAVING USED YOGA FOLLOWING CANCER DIAGNOSIS. WHITE PATIENTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO USE YOGA THAN NONWHITE PATIENTS (P = .02). HIGHER EDUCATION LEVEL, LOWER BMI (BODY MASS INDEX), PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT STATUS, PREVIOUS CHEMOTHERAPY, AND RADIATION THERAPY WERE ALL ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER YOGA USE (ALL P < .05). CONTROLLING FOR OTHER FACTORS, GREATER YOGA USE WAS INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER EDUCATION LEVEL (ADJUSTED ODDS RATIO [AOR] 2.72, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI], 1.15-6.46), AND LOWER BMI (AOR 0.25, 95% CI, 0.09-0.66). CONCLUSION: YOGA USE FOLLOWING BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSIS WAS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER FOR WHITE PATIENTS AND THOSE WITH LOWER BMI AND HIGHER EDUCATION LEVELS. CONSIDERING ITS POTENTIAL BENEFITS FOR SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT IN CANCER, MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND THE ATTITUDES AND BARRIERS TO YOGA USE AMONG INDIVIDUALS WITH NONWHITE RACE, LOWER EDUCATION, AND HIGHER BMI LEVEL. SUCH INVESTIGATION WILL HELP DESIGN YOGA PROGRAMS THAT ARE ALIGNED TO THE NEEDS OF THESE POPULATIONS.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
18  563  35 CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYSIS OF HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE AND ELEMENTS OF YOGA PRACTICE. BACKGROUND: MIND-BODY PRACTICES SUCH AS YOGA HAVE BEEN STUDIED FOR THEIR GENERALLY POSITIVE EFFECTS ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL). THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HOW A PERSON PRACTICES YOGA AND THE PERSON'S HRQOL IS NOT KNOWN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: YOGA PRACTITIONERS WERE SENT INVITATIONS TO PARTICIPATE IN AN ONLINE SURVEY VIA EMAIL. YOGA CHARACTERISTICS, HRQOL, AND OTHER SOCIODEMOGRAPHICS WERE COLLECTED. ANALYSES OF DATA FROM 309 CONSENTING RESPONDERS EVALUATED ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN YOGA PRACTICE CHARACTERISTICS (USE OF YOGA TOOLS, LENGTH OF PRACTICE, LOCATION, METHOD, ETC.) AND THE 10-ITEM PROMIS GLOBAL HEALTH SCALE FOR BOTH PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENTS. RESULTS: MULTIVARIABLE REGRESSION MODELS DEMONSTRATED HIGHER MENTAL HEALTH SCORES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH REGULAR MEDITATION PRACTICE, HIGHER INCOME, AND THE METHOD OF PRACTICING IN A COMMUNITY GROUP CLASS (VERSUS ONE-ON-ONE). HIGHER PHYSICAL HEALTH SCORES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH LENGTH OF LIFETIME PRACTICE, TEACHER STATUS, KRISHNAMACHARYA YOGA STYLE, AND PRACTICING IN A YOGA SCHOOL/STUDIO (VERSUS AT HOME). CONCLUSIONS: MEDITATION PRACTICE IN YOGA IS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH MENTAL HEALTH. LENGTH OF LIFETIME YOGA PRACTICE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER PHYSICAL HEALTH, SUGGESTING YOGA HAS A POTENTIAL CUMULATIVE BENEFIT OVER TIME. DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND METHODS OF PRACTICE MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH VARYING EFFECTS ON HEALTH OUTCOMES. COMPARATIVE CROSS-SECTIONAL AND LONGITUDINAL STUDIES ON THE VARIATIONS IN YOGA PRACTICE ARE NEEDED TO FURTHER CHARACTERIZE HEALTH BENEFITS OF YOGA.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
19 2537  40 YOGA EXPERIENCE AS A PREDICTOR OF PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLNESS IN WOMEN OVER 45 YEARS. BACKGROUND: ALTHOUGH HIGH LEVELS OF SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING (SWB) ARE COMMON IN OLD AGE, A SUBSET OF OLDER INDIVIDUALS IS DISPROPORTIONATELY VULNERABLE TO NEGATIVE AFFECT. YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE MANY SHORT-TERM BENEFITS, BUT RESEARCHERS HAVE NOT DETERMINED WHETHER A LONG-TERM OR FREQUENT YOGA PRACTICE INCREASINGLY PROTECTS OLDER WOMEN FROM LOW LEVELS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING. AIMS: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH PSYCHOLOGICAL ATTITUDES, TRANSCENDENCE, MENTAL MASTERY, AND SUBJECTIVE VITALITY IN A SAMPLE OF FEMALE YOGA PRACTITIONERS OVER 45 YEARS VARIED ACCORDING TO THE LENGTH AND FREQUENCY OF YOGA PRACTICE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE ADMINISTERED ONLINE SURVEYS TO A NON-PROBABILITY SAMPLE OF 211 FEMALE YOGA PRACTITIONERS 45 TO 80. WE USED WEIGHTED LEAST SQUARES REGRESSION ANALYSES TO EVALUATE THE RELATIONSHIP OF EXTENT OF YOGA EXPERIENCE TO THE OUTCOME VARIABLES AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR AGE AND LIFESTYLE FACTORS. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS HAD PRACTICED YOGA FOR AS LONG AS 50 YEARS AND FOR UP TO 28 H PER WEEK. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN YOGA EXPERIENCE AND ALL OUTCOME VARIABLES. THESE SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS REMAINED AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR AGE AND LIFESTYLE FACTORS. WHEN WE COMPUTED YOGA EXPERIENCE IN TERMS OF TOTAL CALENDAR YEARS, WITHOUT ACCOUNTING FOR HOURS OF PRACTICE, SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS DID NOT REMAIN. TRANSCENDENCE OF THE ORDINARY WAS THE MOST STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH CURRENT YOGA PRACTICE FREQUENCY, AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL ATTITUDES WERE THE MOST STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH TOTAL LIFETIME HOURS OF PRACTICE. CONCLUSIONS: AMONG A NON-PROBABILITY SAMPLE OF FEMALE YOGA PRACTITIONERS BETWEEN 45 AND 80 YEARS, INCREASED YOGA EXPERIENCE PREDICTED INCREASED LEVELS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING. RESULTS SHOWED A DOSE-RESPONSE EFFECT, WITH YOGA EXPERIENCE EXERCISING AN INCREASINGLY PROTECTIVE EFFECT AGAINST LOW LEVELS OF SWB AND VITALITY.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
20 2370  44 WHAT BRINGS YOUNG ADULTS TO THE YOGA MAT? CROSS-SECTIONAL ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AND PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH AMONG PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROJECT EAT-IV SURVEY. OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY EXAMINES MOTIVATIONS FOR YOGA AND IDENTIFIES UNIQUE MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AMONG A SAMPLE OF YOUNG ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS. THIS STUDY FURTHER DETERMINES HOW YOUNG ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS' MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES ASSOCIATE WITH PHYSICAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS. SUBJECTS/SETTING: SURVEY DATA WERE DRAWN FROM THE FOURTH WAVE OF A LARGE, POPULATION-BASED STUDY (PROJECT EAT-IV; EATING AND ACTIVITY IN TEENS AND YOUNG ADULTS). DESIGN: LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS (LCA) WAS USED TO IDENTIFY MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AMONG PROJECT EAT-IV PARTICIPANTS PRACTICING YOGA (N = 297; MEAN AGE: 30.8-1.7 YEARS; 79.7 % FEMALE). CROSS-SECTIONAL ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN LATENT MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES, PHYSICAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS WERE DETERMINED WITH UNADJUSTED AND ADJUSTED (GENDER, RACE/ETHNICITY, AND BODY MASS INDEX) GENERAL LINEAR MODELS. RESULTS: ACROSS MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES, MOST YOUNG ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS WERE MOTIVATED BY ENHANCED FITNESS AND STRESS REDUCTION/RELAXATION. ADDITIONAL MOTIVATIONS FOR YOGA CLUSTERED BY APPEARANCE (DESIRE TO CHANGE BODY APPEARANCE OR WEIGHT) OR MINDFULNESS (DESIRE TO INCREASE PRESENT MOMENT AWARENESS) UNDERPINNINGS. THE LCA CHARACTERIZED MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AS "LOW APPEARANCE, LOW MINDFULNESS" (CLASS 1; N = 77), "LOW APPEARANCE, HIGH MINDFULNESS" (CLASS 2; N = 48), "HIGH APPEARANCE, LOW MINDFULNESS" (CLASS 3; N = 79), AND "HIGH APPEARANCE, HIGH MINDFULNESS" (CLASS 4; N = 93). HAVING A PROFILE WITH HIGH MINDFULNESS AND LOW APPEARANCE MOTIVATIONS (CLASS 2) WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER BODY SATISFACTION IN COMPARISON TO THE OTHER CLASSES (P < 0.001). RELATIVE TO CLASS 2, THOSE WITH LOW MINDFULNESS MOTIVATIONS (CLASS 1; CLASS 3) REPORTED LESS TOTAL PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (P = 0.002) AND THOSE WITH HIGH APPEARANCE MOTIVATIONS (CLASS 3; CLASS 4) REPORTED HIGHER COMPULSIVE EXERCISE SCORES (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: IN THIS SAMPLE, HIGH MINDFULNESS AND LOW APPEARANCE MOTIVATIONS FOR YOGA APPEARED OPTIMAL FOR PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH. CROSS-SECTIONAL FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOUNG ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS' MIND-BODY HEALTH MAY BE SUPPORTED BY MOTIVATIONAL UNDERPINNINGS THAT EMPHASIZE YOGA'S INTERNAL (MINDFULNESS) RATHER THAN EXTERNAL (APPEARANCE) BENEFITS.	2022

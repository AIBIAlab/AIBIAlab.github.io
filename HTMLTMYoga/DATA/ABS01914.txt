1 1914 104 ROLE OF INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY IN A FAILED POST-TOTAL KNEE REPLACEMENT OF BILATERAL KNEES. OA KNEE IS THE MOST COMMON ARTHRITIS. KNEE REPLACEMENT SURGERIES ARE BEING DONE INCREASINGLY IN THE PRESENT TIMES. THIS HAS LED TO THE VIOLATION OF THE STANDARD INDICATIONS AND WHEN KNEES ARE REPLACED IGNORING OTHER CO - MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS IT RESULTS IN THE SURGERY FAILING EARLY. THIS IS ABOUT A PATIENT WHO ENCOUNTERED A FAILED TKR DUE TO IMPROPER SELECTION AS PATIENT HAD BILATERAL OA HIP THAT WAS IGNORED IN THE INITIAL STAGES. TO OVERCOME THE PROBLEM SHE WAS ADVISED BILATERAL HIP REPLACEMENT WHICH WOULD LEAVE HER WITH FOUR REPLACEMENTS IN THE LOWER LIMB. SHE REFUSED SURGERY AND WAS TOLD THERE ARE NO ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS. THIS PATIENT UNDERWENT A 3 WEEK INTEGRATED COURSE OF IAYT AT OUR CENTER AND SHE MADE A REMARKABLE RECOVERY. IAYT IS A GOOD NON-SURGICAL TREATMENT THAT CAN BE AFFECTIVE BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER KNEE REPLACEMENT AND IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS THE FIRST CHOICE OF TREATMENT BEFORE SURGERY.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
2 2501  23 YOGA AS THERAPY FOR NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS: A CASE REPORT OF THERAPEUTIC YOGA FOR ADRENOMYELONEUROPATHY. YOGA IS A PROMISING THERAPEUTIC MODALITY FOR NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES. THIS CASE STUDY PRESENTS A THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROTOCOL FOR ADRENOMYELONEUROPATHY (AMN) AND ITS EFFECT ON A PATIENT'S QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), AGILITY, BALANCE, AND PERIPHERAL DEXTERITY. A 61-Y-OLD MAN DIAGNOSED WITH AMN WHO WAS EXPERIENCING (1) PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY IN HIS LEGS AND FEET, (2) LOWER-BACK PAIN (LBP), AND (3) OSTEOARTHRITIS RECEIVED 60-MIN WEEKLY THERAPEUTIC YOGA SESSIONS FOR A 10-MO PERIOD. YOGA THERAPY INCLUDED HATHA YOGA ASANAS (POSES) AND PRANAYAMA (BREATHING EXERCISES). HATHA YOGA ASANAS WERE ALIGNED WITH 7 BERG BALANCE SCALE (BBS) INDICATORS TO MEASURE IMPROVEMENT IN BALANCE AND RANGE OF MOTION. THE 10-MO COURSE OF THERAPEUTIC YOGA RESULTED IN IMPROVED LBP; IMPROVED FLEXION OF THE PATIENT'S HIPS, KNEES, AND ANKLES; IMPROVED PROPULSION PHASE OF WALKING; AND IMPROVEMENT IN THE PATIENT'S ABILITY TO STAND AND BALANCE WITHOUT AN ASSISTIVE DEVICE. THE EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY ON THE PATIENT IN THIS CASE STUDY ALIGNS WITH CURRENT QOL IMPROVEMENTS NOTED IN CURRENT RESEARCH ON YOGA THERAPY FOR NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS. THE DESCRIBED CONCEPTS AND METHODS OF EMPLOYING THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROVIDE INSIGHTS FOR CLINICIANS INTO A MODALITY THAT IS LOW RISK AND LOW COST AND THAT CAN SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS WITH OTHER NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS, SUCH AS MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS), FIBROMYALGIA (FM), AND DISEASES OF THE PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. FURTHER STUDY IS WARRANTED TO HELP DETERMINE THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF YOGA THERAPY FOR THESE CONDITIONS.	2014

4 2461  27 YOGA AS A NOVEL ADJUVANT THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH IDIOPATHIC INFLAMMATORY MYOPATHIES. CONTEXT: RECENT STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS WELL TOLERATED BY PATIENTS WITH IDIOPATHIC INFLAMMATORY MYOPATHIES (IIMS) AND CAN HAVE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS AS AN ADJUVANT THERAPY TO PHARMACOLOGIC AGENTS, ESPECIALLY IF STARTED EARLY. TO DATE, NO STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PATIENTS WITH IIMS. AIMS: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SELF-REPORTED DIFFICULTY IN PERFORMING ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING (ADL) AND MUSCLE STRENGTH IN PATIENTS WITH MILD-TO-MODERATE IIMS. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A LONGITUDINAL COHORT STUDY IN WHICH PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSESSED USING THE MYOSITIS ACTIVITIES PROFILE (MAP) AND MANUAL MUSCLE TESTING (MMT) BEFORE AND AFTER THE COMPLETION OF AN 8-WEEK INSTRUCTOR-GUIDED YOGA COURSE WAS PERFORMED. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: WILCOXON SIGNED-RANKED TEST WAS PERFORMED FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. RESULTS: THE AVERAGE POSTTREATMENT MAP SCORES OF SIX PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED AN INCREASE OF 2.51 POINTS, WHILE THE AVERAGE MMT SCORE OF FOUR PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED AN INCREASE OF 11 POINTS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY IS THE FIRST STUDY TO DATE TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA AS AN ADJUVANT COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH IIM. CONTINUED RESEARCH SHOULD BE DONE ON THE EFFECT OF YOGA AS AN ADJUVANT THERAPY, FOR IN ADDITION TO INCREASE IN MUSCLE STRENGTH AND ABILITY TO PERFORM ADL, YOGA MAY OFFER POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS IN MOOD, MENTAL HEALTH, AND SLEEP.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
5  371  21 AWARENESS AND PRACTICE OF AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA AMONG HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS IN ANAND CITY. BACKGROUND: AEROBIC EXERCISE IS HELPFUL IN REDUCING ELEVATED BLOOD PRESSURE (BP). IT WAS ALSO FOUND THAT YOGA IS USEFUL IN REDUCING RAISED BP. THUS, THEY BOTH CAN BE USED IN PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION. HENCE, THE STUDY AIMED TO OBSERVE BOTH AWARENESS AND PRACTICE OF AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA AMONG HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS IN ANAND CITY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL DESCRIPTIVE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED. A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS PREPARED CONTAINING 24 QUESTIONS ABOUT AWARENESS AND PRACTICE OF AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA AMONG HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS. THE QUESTIONS WERE EXPLAINED TO ALL THE PATIENTS, AND 200 PATIENTS WERE RECRUITED FROM ANAND CITY THROUGH CONVENIENCE SAMPLING. RESULTS: TWO-HUNDRED PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED IN THIS STUDY, OF WHICH 100% WERE AWARE OF HYPERTENSION. 67.68% WERE AWARE OF THE ROLE OF AEROBIC EXERCISE IN HYPERTENSION, OF WHICH 58.29% PRACTICED THEM. THE AWARENESS OF THE ROLE OF YOGA IN HYPERTENSION WAS NOTED IN 33.67% OF PATIENTS, OF WHICH ONLY 13.07% PRACTICED PRANAYAMA AND 9.50% PRACTICED ASANAS. CONCLUSION: THERE WAS A COMPLETE AWARENESS OF HYPERTENSION AMONG HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS. A LARGE NUMBER OF PATIENTS WERE AWARE OF THE ROLE OF AEROBIC EXERCISE IN HYPERTENSION, BUT ONLY FEW OF THE PATIENTS PRACTICED THEM. HOWEVER, THERE WAS LESS AWARENESS OF THE ROLE OF YOGA IN HYPERTENSION AND EVEN LESSER NUMBER PRACTICED THEM.	2019

THESE MISUSES ARE UNCOVERED WITH SUGGESTIONS MADE AS TO HOW THERAPISTS CAN SUPPORT THE PRACTICE OF YOGA IN RESIDENTIAL AND OUTPATIENT SETTINGS.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
7 1571  20 MANAGEMENT OF MYOFASCIAL PAIN DYSFUNCTION SYNDROME WITH MEDITATION AND YOGA: HEALING THROUGH NATURAL THERAPY. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY WERE TO STUDY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RAJ-YOGA MEDITATION AND PRANAYAMA IN PATIENTS WITH MYOFASCIAL PAIN DYSFUNCTION SYNDROME (MPDS) AND COMPARED THE EFFECTS WITH ONGOING CONVENTIONAL NONINVASIVE TREATMENT MODALITIES. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE STUDY COMPRISED 30 PATIENTS DIVIDED EQUALLY (10 EACH) INTO 3 GROUP, I.E., CONTROL GROUP (CONVENTIONAL, NONINVASIVE TREATMENT), EXPERIMENTAL A GROUP (CONVENTIONAL, NONINVASIVE TREATMENT WITH RAJ-YOGA MEDITATION THERAPY AND PRANAYAMA), AND EXPERIMENTAL B GROUP (RAJ-YOGA MEDITATION THERAPY AND PRANAYAMA ONLY). PARAMETERS SUCH AS PAIN, MOUTH OPENING, MANDIBULAR DEVIATION, INFLAMMATION, SWELLING, CLICKING, OCCLUSION, AND PSYCHOLOGIC EVALUATION SUCH AS ANXIETY, STRESS, AND DEPRESSION WERE ASSESSED BEFORE THE START OF THE STUDY AND AT WEEKLY INTERVALS FOR 3 MONTHS. RESULTS: POSTTREATMENT PAIN AND INFLAMMATION IMPROVED BOTH IN THE CONTROL GROUP AND EXPERIMENTAL A GROUP, BUT STATISTICALLY IT IS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT IN THE EXPERIMENTAL A GROUP. FURTHERMORE, IT IS EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY AS WELL AS FOR A LONG PERIOD IN EXPERIMENTAL A GROUP. IMPROVEMENT IN MOUTH OPENING WAS STATISTICALLY HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT IN CONTROL GROUP BUT NOT IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS. POSTTREATMENT ANXIETY AND STRESS STATUS WAS IMPROVED WITH STATISTICALLY HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT RESULT IN THE EXPERIMENTAL A AND B. THE POSTTREATMENT DEPRESSION STATUS ALONG WITH MANDIBULAR DEVIATION, SWELLING, CLICKING, AND OCCLUSION HAS NOT IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY IN ANY OF THE GROUPS. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION: RAJ-YOGA MEDITATION AND PRANAYAMA IN COMBINATION WITH CONVENTIONAL, NONINVASIVE, TREATMENT MODALITIES SHOWED PROMISING RESULTS IN MPDS PATIENTS AS COMPARED TO EITHER MODALITIES ALONE.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
8  485  17 CLINICAL GROUP SUPERVISION IN YOGA THERAPY: MODEL EFFECTS, AND LESSONS LEARNED. CLINICAL SUPERVISION IS AN INTEGRAL COMPONENT OF THERAPIST TRAINING AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE OF ITS CAPACITY FOR FOSTERING KNOWLEDGE, SELF-AWARENESS, AND CLINICAL ACUMEN. INDIVIDUAL SUPERVISION IS PART OF MANY YOGA THERAPY TRAINING PROGRAMS AND IS REFERENCED IN THE IAYT STANDARDS AS "MENTORING." GROUP SUPERVISION IS NOT TYPICALLY USED IN THE TRAINING OF YOGA THERAPISTS. WE PROPOSE THAT GROUP SUPERVISION EFFECTIVELY SUPPORTS THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF YOGA THERAPISTS-IN-TRAINING. WE PRESENT A MODEL OF GROUP SUPERVISION FOR YOGA THERAPIST TRAINEES DEVELOPED BY THE NEW ENGLAND SCHOOL OF INTEGRATIVE YOGA THERAPEUTICS (THE NESIYT MODEL) THAT INCLUDES THE BACKGROUND, STRUCTURE, FORMAT, AND DEVELOPMENT OF OUR INAUGURAL 18-MONTH SUPERVISION GROUP. PRE-AND POST-SUPERVISION SURVEYS AND ANALYZED CASE NOTES, WHICH CAPTURED KEY DIDACTIC AND PROCESS THEMES, ARE DISCUSSED. CLINICAL ISSUES, SUCH AS BOUNDARIES, PERFORMANCE ANXIETY, SENSE OF SELF EFFICACY, THE THERAPEUTIC ALLIANCE, TRANSFERENCE AND COUNTER TRANSFERENCE, PACING OF YOGA THERAPY SESSIONS, EVALUATION OF CLIENT PROGRESS, AND ADJUNCT THERAPIST INTERACTION ARE REVIEWED. THE TIMING AND SEQUENCE OF DIDACTIC AND PROCESS THEMES AND BENEFITS FOR YOGA THERAPIST TRAINEES' PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, ARE DISCUSSED. THE NESIYT GROUP SUPERVISION MODEL IS OFFERED AS AN EFFECTIVE BLUEPRINT FOR YOGA THERAPY TRAINING PROGRAMS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
9 1833  18 PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLNESS, YOGA AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS AFFECTED BY SCHIZOPHRENIA SPECTRUM DISORDERS: A PILOT STUDY. SCHIZOPHRENIA IS A SERIOUS PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER CHARACTERIZED BY POSITIVE SYMPTOMS, NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS AND NEUROCOGNITIVE DEFICITS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ESTIMATE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN WELLNESS, YOGA AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS AFFECTED BY SCHIZOPHRENIA SPECTRUM DISORDERS. PARTICIPANTS WERE 30 PATIENTS WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA IN CARE AT THE REHABILITATIVE PSYCHIATRY AND RESEARCH VILLA CHIARA CLINIC IN MASCALUCIA (CATANIA, ITALY), AFTER THAT RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO TWO GROUPS. THE FIRST GROUP FOLLOWED THE EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT WITH SETS OF YOGA EXERCISES CONDUCTED BY A YOGA TRAINER AND A PSYCHIATRIST OR A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST EXPERT IN YOGA, WHILE A SECOND CONTROL GROUP WAS TREATED WITH USUAL CARE. THE RESULTS REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE, BEFORE AND AFTER TREATMENT, BETWEEN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND THE CONTROL GROUP IN QUALITY OF LIFE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
10 1312  17 HEALTH STATUS OF NURSES AND YOGA. I. BASELINE DATA. IN THIS ONGOING ICMR PROJECT ON "EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE HEALTH OF NURSES", SOME BASELINE DATA ON THE HEALTH OF NURSES OF NEHRU HOSPITAL, P.G.I., CHANDIGARH ARE REPORTED. THIS WAS OBTAINED BEFORE THE START OF YOGA THERAPY IN SELECTED CASES AND COLLECTED WITH THE HELP OF SIX PSYCHOLOGICAL TOOLS. OUT OF A TOTAL OF 501 NURSES, 452 (90.2%) COULD BE CONTACTED AND STUDIED. MEAN AGE WAS 30.43 YEARS AND MEAN YEARS OF SERVICE 9.93 YEARS. MEAN SCORES ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS INDICATED POOR HEALTH STATUS OF NURSES, AVERAGE NEUROTICISM, DEPRESSIVE TENDENCIES AND ROLE STRESS. SENSE OF WELL-BEING WAS HIGH IN THEM. THE DATA IS DISCUSSED IN THE LIGHT OF RESEARCHES IN THIS AREA. THIS IS THE FIRST OF A SERIES OF THREE ARTICLES TO BE PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL.	1989	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
11 2790  19 YOGA THERAPY FOR ANXIETY: A CASE REPORT. YOGA THERAPY IS A MIND-BODY INTERVENTION THAT CAN BE AN IMPORTANT SOLUTION IN THE TREATMENT OF ANXIETY. YOGA THERAPY ALLEVIATES THE HYPERAROUSAL OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM (SNS) AND THE HYPERVIGILANCE OF THE HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-ADRENAL (HPA) AXIS THAT OCCURS IN ANXIETY. YOGA THERAPY ACTIVATES THE PARASYMPATHETIC BRANCH OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM, REPLACING SNS OVERDRIVE, OR THE FLIGHT-OR-FIGHT RESPONSE, WITH THE RELAXATION RESPONSE AND BALANCING THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. YOGA THERAPY INCREASES POSITIVE COPING SKILLS AND BUILDS SELF-ESTEEM WITHOUT HARMFUL SIDE EFFECTS. THE RESULTS OF THIS CASE STUDY HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE CLINICAL EFFICACY OF YOGA THERAPY IN THE TREATMENT OF ANXIETY AND PANIC DISORDER (PD) IN AN ADOLESCENT FEMALE. TREATMENT CONSISTED OF 4 WKS OF INDIVIDUAL SESSIONS (60-MIN SESSION/WK) AND 6 WKS OF GROUP SESSIONS (90-MIN SESSION/WK) WITH DAILY HOME PRACTICE. THE RESULTS OF THE CASE STUDY ARE SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE GROWING NUMBERS OF YOUTH IN THE UNITED STATES ARE PRESENTING WITH ANXIETY AND SEEKING NONPHARMACOLOGICAL OPTIONS.	2013

IT CAN THEREFORE BE CONCLUDED THAT YOGA THERAPY IS MOST EFFECTIVE WITH ASTHMA.	1982	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
13  332  24 APPLICATION OF STANDARDISED YOGA PROTOCOLS AS THE BASIS OF PHYSIOTHERAPY RECOMMENDATION IN TREATMENT OF SLEEP APNEAS: MOVING BEYOND PRANAYAMAS. YOGA IS AN ANCIENT INDIAN PRACTICE OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL EXERCISES (SYN: ASANAS), POSTURES (SYN: MUDRAS), MOVEMENTS AND BREATHING TECHNIQUES WHICH SUSTAIN HEALTHY LIVING OF THE BODY AND THE MIND. IT INCORPORATES VARIOUS EXERCISES OF BREATHING, OROPHARYNGEAL STRUCTURES AND FACIAL EXPRESSIONS, THE PHYSIOLOGY AND EFFECT OF WHICH ARE COMPARABLE TO INTERNATIONAL PHYSIOTHERAPY RECOMMENDATIONS IN TREATMENT OF OBSTRUCTIVE SLEEP APNEA (OSA) I.E. TO PRESERVE UPPER AIRWAY PATENCY BY MAINTAINING AIRWAY DILATOR MUSCLE TONE. PRELIMINARY RESULTS SHOW THAT YOGA CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO PHYSIOTHERAPY FOR SLEEP APNEA AND SNORING PATIENTS. TO COMPARE THE PHYSIOTHERAPY RECOMMENDATIONS IN SNORING PATIENTS WITH VARIOUS YOGA EXERCISES POSTURES. TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN TREATMENT OF SLEEP APNEA. TO FORMULATE A STANDARDIZED YOGA PROTOCOL FOR UNIVERSAL USAGE IN SLEEP APNEA. WE STUDIED THE AVAILABLE LITERATURE ON PHYSIOTHERAPY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OSA AND YOGA ASANAS INVOLVING THE NASAL, OROPHARYNX AND FACIAL STRUCTURES AND PERCEIVED A NOTEWORTHY SIMILARITY IN PHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS OF BOTH. A SET OF THESE YOGASANAS WERE PUT TOGETHER AND PATIENTS PRESENTING WITH SNORING AND DIAGNOSED WITH MILD TO MODERATE SLEEP APNEA WERE PRESENTED AND ENCOURAGED TO PERFORM THE STANDARDIZED SET OF YOGA EXERCISES FOR A PERIOD OF 3 MONTHS. A TOTAL OF 23 PATIENTS WERE RECOMMENDED YOGA PROTOCOLS AS INITIAL FORM OF TREATMENT IN SNORING AND MILD TO MODERATE SLEEP APNEA. CLINICAL AND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT GAUZED BY RECOMMENDED SCORE CHART WAS DISCERNED IN MAJORITY OF SUBJECTS. THE RESULTS WERE COMPARABLE TO THE EFFICACY OF EXISTING PHYSIOTHERAPY REGIMEN PUBLISHED IN INTERNATIONAL LITERATURE. THE BENEFITS OF YOGA IN SLEEP DISORDERS GO BEYOND THE SCOPE OF MEASURED OUTCOMES. STANDARDIZING THE PROTOCOLS FOR YOGA IN TREATMENT FOR SNORING AND SLEEP APNEA IS THE NEED OF THE HOUR. FURTHER STUDIES ON EFFICACY OF YOGA NEED TO BE PERFORMED TO UNDERSTAND ITS FULL REALM OF POTENTIAL.	2019	
          
14  554  24 CORRELATION OF PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE WITH INTENT TO RECOMMEND ADJUNCTIVE OSTEOPATHIC MANIPULATIVE TREATMENT OR YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. CONTEXT: OSTEOPATHIC MANIPULATIVE TREATMENT (OMT) AND YOGA ARE BOTH RECOMMENDED BY SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS IN THE EVIDENCE-BASED RESEARCH LITERATURE FOR LOW BACK PAIN MANAGEMENT. IT IS UNKNOWN, TO THE AUTHORS' KNOWLEDGE, WHAT THE EFFECT OF PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH OMT OR YOGA, READING RESEARCH ARTICLES ON OMT OR YOGA, OR BOTH WILL HAVE ON MEDICAL STUDENTS' RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THESE TREATMENT OPTIONS TO FUTURE PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF OSTEOPATHIC MEDICAL STUDENTS RECOMMENDING OMT OR YOGA TO TREAT PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN BASED ON THEIR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OR READING RESEARCH ARTICLES THAT RECOMMEND OMT OR YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. METHODS: IN THIS PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY, RESEARCHERS ADMINISTERED AN ANONYMOUS 18-QUESTION ONLINE SURVEY FOR OSTEOPATHIC MEDICAL STUDENTS. THE SURVEY INCLUDED A PATIENT VIGNETTE, 2 EVIDENCE-BASED ARTICLES, AND MULTIPLE CHOICE, YES/NO, AND LIKERT-TYPE QUESTIONS. PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED VIA EMAIL FROM ALL 4 YEARS OF MEDICAL SCHOOL. BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCES IN PROPORTIONS WERE ASSESSED WITH DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS AND CHI2 TESTS; DIFFERENCES WITHIN GROUPS WERE ASSESSED WITH THE MCNEMAR TEST; AND FISCHER EXACT TESTS WERE USED WHEN EXPECTED CELL COUNTS WERE LESS THAN 5. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 180 PARTICIPANTS (100 MALE, 80 FEMALE) COMPLETED THE STUDY. PERSONAL EXPERIENCE INCREASED THE LIKELIHOOD OF OSTEOPATHIC MEDICAL STUDENTS RECOMMENDING OMT (P<.018) OR YOGA (P<.001) TO A FUTURE PATIENT OR TO A PATIENT IN A CASE VIGNETTE (P<.05) WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. STUDENTS WHO READ RESEARCH ARTICLES WERE MORE LIKELY TO RECOMMEND OMT TO THE CASE PATIENT AND FUTURE PATIENTS BEFORE AND AFTER READING THE INTERVENTION ARTICLE REGARDLESS OF THEIR EXPERIENCE (P<.001). CONCLUSION: PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND READING EVIDENCE-BASED RESEARCH MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT OSTEOPATHIC MEDICAL STUDENTS WILL RECOMMEND OMT TO FUTURE PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN.	2018	

15  568  25 DECODING THE INTEGRATED APPROACH TO YOGA THERAPY: QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE BASED CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK. AIM: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DEFINE, DECODE, AND APPEND TO THE CONCEPTUAL FRAME-WORK OF THE INTEGRATED APPROACH TO YOGA THERAPY (IAYT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: FOUR STAKEHOLDERS WHO FOLLOWED TWO IN-PATIENTS WITH DEPRESSION OVER A PERIOD OF 2 WEEKS IN THE RESIDENTIAL CENTER AROGYADHAMA (OF SWAMI VIVEKANANDA YOGA ANUSANDANA SAMSTHANA, BANGALORE, INDIA) WERE INTERVIEWED BEFORE THE START OF THE IAYT TREATMENT AND PRIOR TO DISCHARGE OF THE PATIENT. THE PATIENTS WERE ALSO INTERVIEWED PRE AND POST AND WERE OBSERVED ONCE DURING THEIR SESSION. THE DATA FROM THE AUDIO RECORDINGS FROM EIGHT IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WERE TRANSCRIBED MANUALLY AND QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED. RESULTS: THE CONCEPTUAL FRAME-WORK OF IAYT DEPICTS THAT PATIENT RELATED FACTORS ("CO-OPERATION OF PATIENT", "PATIENTS AWARENESS OF HIS/HER CONDITION"), THERAPIST RELATED FACTORS ("ABILITY TO GUIDE", "THE ASSISTANCE TO THE PATIENTS", "EXPLANATION OF THE EXERCISES") AND TREATMENT RELATED FACTORS ("COMBINATION OF PSYCHIATRIC OR AYURVEDIC MEDICATION WITH YOGA", "COUNSELING DURING THE IAYT TREATMENT", DURATION OF TREATMENT), PLAY AN INTEGRATED ROLE IN REACHING THE "AIM OF IAYT" AND EXPERIENCING "IMPROVEMENTS AND CHANGES". CONCLUSION: THE IAYT IS A HOLISTIC PROGRAM AND THE ABILITY OF THE PATIENT TO COOPERATE WITH AND INTEGRATE THE AVAILABLE FACTORS (THERAPIST RELATED AND TREATMENT RELATED) COULD ENABLE BEST RESULTS.	2014

17 2611  18 YOGA FOR REHABILITATION: AN OVERVIEW. THE USE OF YOGA FOR REHABILITATION HAS DIVERSE APPLICATIONS. YOGA PRACTICE BENEFITED MENTALLY HANDICAPPED SUBJECTS BY IMPROVING THEIR MENTAL ABILITY, ALSO THE MOTOR CO-ORDINATION AND SOCIAL SKILLS. PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED SUBJECTS HAD A RESTORATION OF SOME DEGREE OF FUNCTIONAL ABILITY AFTER PRACTICING YOGA. VISUALLY IMPAIRED CHILDREN CHILDREN SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THEIR ABNORMAL ANXIETY LEVELS WHEN THEY PRACTICED YOGA FOR THREE WEEKS, WHILE A PROGRAM OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY HAD NO SUCH EFFECT. SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED ADULTS (PRISONERS IN A JAIL) AND CHILDREN IN A REMAND HOME SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SLEEP, APPETITE AND GENERAL WELL BEING, AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN PHYSIOLOGICAL AROUSAL. THE PRACTICE OF MEDITATION WAS REPORTED TO DECREASE THE DEGREE OF SUBSTANCE (MARIJUANA) ABUSE, BY STRENGTHENING THE MENTAL RESOLVE AND DECREASING THE ANXIETY. ANOTHER IMPORTANT AREA IS THE APPLICATION OF YOGA (AND INDEED, LIFESTYLE CHANGE), IN THE REHABILITATION OF PATIENTS WITH CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE. FINALLY, THE POSSIBLE ROLE OF YOGA IN IMPROVING THE MENTAL STATE AND GENERAL WELL BEING OF HIV POSITIVE PERSONS AND PATIENTS WITH AIDS, IS BEING EXPLORED.	1997	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
18 2085  23 THE EFFECT OF LONG TERM COMBINED YOGA PRACTICE ON THE BASAL METABOLIC RATE OF HEALTHY ADULTS. BACKGROUND: DIFFERENT PROCEDURES PRACTICED IN YOGA HAVE STIMULATORY OR INHIBITORY EFFECTS ON THE BASAL METABOLIC RATE WHEN STUDIED ACUTELY. IN DAILY LIFE HOWEVER, THESE PROCEDURES ARE USUALLY PRACTICED IN COMBINATION. THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE NET CHANGE IN THE BASAL METABOLIC RATE (BMR) OF INDIVIDUALS ACTIVELY ENGAGING IN A COMBINATION OF YOGA PRACTICES (ASANA OR YOGIC POSTURES, MEDITATION AND PRANAYAMA OR BREATHING EXERCISES) FOR A MINIMUM PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS, AT A RESIDENTIAL YOGA EDUCATION AND RESEARCH CENTER AT BANGALORE. METHODS: THE MEASURED BMR OF INDIVIDUALS PRACTICING YOGA THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PRACTICES WAS COMPARED WITH THAT OF CONTROL SUBJECTS WHO DID NOT PRACTICE YOGA BUT LED SIMILAR LIFESTYLES. RESULTS: THE BMR OF THE YOGA PRACTITIONERS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THAT OF THE NON-YOGA GROUP, AND WAS LOWER BY ABOUT 13 % WHEN ADJUSTED FOR BODY WEIGHT (P < 0.001). THIS DIFFERENCE PERSISTED WHEN THE GROUPS WERE STRATIFIED BY GENDER; HOWEVER, THE DIFFERENCE IN BMR ADJUSTED FOR BODY WEIGHT WAS GREATER IN WOMEN THAN MEN (ABOUT 8 AND 18% RESPECTIVELY). IN ADDITION, THE MEAN BMR OF THE YOGA GROUP WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THEIR PREDICTED VALUES, WHILE THE MEAN BMR OF NON-YOGA GROUP WAS COMPARABLE WITH THEIR PREDICTED VALUES DERIVED FROM 1985 WHO/FAO/UNU PREDICTIVE EQUATIONS. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BMR, PROBABLY LINKED TO REDUCED AROUSAL, WITH THE LONG TERM PRACTICE OF YOGA USING A COMBINATION OF STIMULATORY AND INHIBITORY YOGIC PRACTICES.	2006	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
19 2221  22 THE IMPACT OF LAUGHTER YOGA ON THE STRESS OF CANCER PATIENTS BEFORE CHEMOTHERAPY. BACKGROUND: CANCER IS USUALLY ACCOMPANIED BY CONSIDERABLE STRESS FOR THE SUFFERER, AND THE STRESS HAS DESTRUCTIVE EFFECTS ON CHEMOTHERAPY TREATMENT PROCESS. THEREFORE, THE CURRENT RESEARCH DEALS WITH THE EFFECT OF YOGA LAUGHTER ON THE CANCER PATIENTS' STRESS BEFORE CHEMOTHERAPY. METHODS: IN THIS RESEARCH, AS THE FIRST STEP, 37 CANCER SUFFERERS , WHO HAD BEEN HOSPITALIZED IN SHOHADA TAJRISH HOSPITAL (BEHNAM DANESHPOOR CHARITY ORGANIZATION) AND HAD THE REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY FOR BEING TAKEN AS RESEARCH SAMPLES, WERE SELECTED FOR DATA COLLECTION. THE MENTIONED PATIENTS WERE CLASSIFIED RANDOMLY IN EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUPS. COLLECTED DATA WERE ANALYZED BY THE MULTI-VARIABLE COVARIANCE ANALYSIS TEST. RESULTS: THE RESULTS SHOW THERE IS A MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCE IN THE STRESS AVERAGE BEFORE AND AFTER INTERFERENCE IN THE TEST GROUP (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: LAUGHTER YOGA CAN DECREASE THE STRESS IN CANCER SUFFERERS BEFORE CHEMOTHERAPY.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
20  983  27 EFFECTS OF HATA YOGA ON KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS. BACKGROUND: THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF 8 WEEKS OF HATA YOGA EXERCISES ON WOMEN WITH KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS. STUDIES ABOUT EFFECTS OF YOGA ON DIFFERENT CHRONIC DISEASES SHOW THAT THESE EXERCISES HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON CHRONIC DISEASES. AS KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS IS VERY COMMON AMONG MIDDLE AGE WOMEN WE DECIDED TO MEASURE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE EXERCISES ON KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS. METHODS: SAMPLE INCLUDED 30 WOMEN WITH KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS WHO VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATED IN THIS SEMI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY AND WERE DIVIDED INTO A CONTROL GROUP (15) AND A YOGA GROUP (15). THE YOGA GROUP RECEIVED 60 MINUTES SESSIONS OF HATA YOGA, 3 TIMES A WEEK AND FOR 8 WEEKS. PAIN, SYMPTOMS, DAILY ACTIVITIES, SPORTS AND SPARE-TIME ACTIVITIES, AND QUALITY OF LIFE WERE RESPECTIVELY MEASURED BY VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS) AND KNEE INJURY AND OSTEOARTHRITIS OUTCOME SCALE (KOOS) QUESTIONNAIRE. THE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA) METHOD FOR REPETITIVE DATA WAS USED TO ANALYZE THE RESULTS (P = 0.05). RESULTS: FINDINGS SHOWED THAT PAIN AND SYMPTOMS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED AND SCORES OF DAILY ACTIVITIES, SPORTS, SPARE-TIME ACTIVITIES, AND QUALITY OF LIFE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN THE YOGA GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: IT SEEMS THAT YOGA CAN BE USED AS A CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT BESIDES USUAL TREATMENTS AND MEDICATIONS TO IMPROVE THE CONDITION OF PEOPLE WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS.	2013

1  561 81 CREATING SPACE THROUGH AFRICA YOGA PROJECT: A QUALITATIVE STUDY. THIS QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS EXAMINED TEACHERS' EXPERIENCES OF THE AFRICA YOGA PROJECT (AYP), A MENTORING-ORIENTED YOGA PROGRAM FOR FOSTERING RESILIENCE AMONG INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS IMPACTED BY POVERTY AND TRAUMA. INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED WITH AYP TEACHERS WERE CODED USING QUALITATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS. THEMES DEMONSTRATED THAT AYP BENEFITED PARTICIPANTS BY CREATING S.P.A.C.E. (SAFETY AND STABILITY, PERSONAL GROWTH, ACTION, CULTURAL DIVERSITY, AND EMPOWERMENT). THE FINDINGS ILLUSTRATED WAYS IN WHICH THIS PROGRAM FOSTERED INDIVIDUAL AND COMMUNITY WELLNESS AND POSITIVE ENGAGEMENT. IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL FOR PROVIDING YOGA AS A LOW-COST, SUSTAINABLE, AND EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION TO PROMOTE HEALTH, ECONOMIC SELF-SUFFICIENCY, AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IN DIVERSE SETTINGS WITH LIMITED RESOURCES.	2016

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: PEOPLE WITH MOBILITY IMPAIRMENTS FACE INCREASED BARRIERS TO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. THE STUDY AIMED TO UNDERSTAND THE LIVED EXPERIENCES OF INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITY WHO ARE REGULAR PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA FOR EVERYONE CLASS TO INFORM FUTURE RESEARCH, INTERVENTION AND COMMUNITY PROGRAMS.METHODS: A PHENOMENOLOGICAL QUALITATIVE APPROACH UTILIZED SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS AND CLASS OBSERVATIONS. DATA WAS ANALYZED THROUGH ITERATIVE INDUCTIVE THEMATIC ANALYSIS.RESULTS: SIX PEOPLE OF VARIED MOBILITY LIMITATIONS PARTICIPATED. THEMATIC ANALYSIS REVEALED THEMES ON INFLUENTIAL ENVIRONMENTAL AND PERSONAL FACTORS, A HOLISTIC-FOCUSED CLASS ENVIRONMENT, PHYSICAL IMPROVEMENTS, MENTAL/EMOTIONAL IMPACT, AND A SENSE OF BELONGING TO COMMUNITY.CONCLUSION: THE YOGA FOR EVERYONE CLASS FOSTERED MULTI-FACETED OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE WITH DIVERSE MOVEMENT IMPAIRMENTS. FOCUSING ON COMMUNITY-CLINICAL PARTNERSHIPS, UTILIZING A CLASS STRUCTURE WITH VOLUNTEERS, AND FOSTERING AN ONGOING INCLUSIVE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT ARE POTENTIAL STRATEGIES FOR SUCCESS IN OTHER COMMUNITY PROGRAMS FOR THOSE WITH DISABILITY.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
3 1342 25 HOW YOGA HELPS HEAL INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA: PERSPECTIVES AND THEMES FROM 11 INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA SURVIVORS. TRAUMA IS UBIQUITOUS IN OUR SOCIETY; THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO EXPLORE HOW INDIVIDUALS CULTIVATE HEALING AFTER TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES. YOGA MAY BE ONE AVENUE TO CULTIVATE HEALING. QUALITATIVE METHODS WERE EMPLOYED TO STUDY THE ROLE YOGA PRACTICE PLAYED IN THE HEALING PROCESS OF THOSE WHO EXPERIENCED INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA. ELEVEN INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA SURVIVORS WHO PRACTICED YOGA REGULARLY WERE IDENTIFIED THROUGH A CRITERION SAMPLING METHOD. DATA ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE EMPHASIS OF YOGA ON MIND AND PHYSICAL BODY FOSTERED NUMEROUS POSITIVE OUTCOMES, SUCH AS SPIRITUAL GROWTH, SELF-ACCEPTANCE, ALLEVIATION OF TRAUMA-RELATED SYMPTOMS, AND INCREASED FEELINGS OF SELF-COMPASSION, EMPOWERMENT, AND SERENITY. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY BE HELPFUL TO REGAIN MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH, FOSTER WELLBEING, AND CULTIVATE PERSONAL GROWTH AFTER INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
4  149 32 A QUALITATIVE EXPLORATION OF THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WITH AROMATASE INHIBITOR-ASSOCIATED ARTHRALGIAS. RESEARCH QUESTION: ARTHRALGIA AFFECTS POSTMENOPAUSAL BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS (BCS) RECEIVING AROMATASE INHIBITORS (AI), WHICH MAY RESULT IN REDUCED FUNCTION AND LONG-TERM WELL-BEING. THIS IS AN EXPLORATORY, QUALITATIVE INVESTIGATION OF BCS WHO PARTICIPATED IN A YOGA-BASED PROGRAM TO UNDERSTAND IMPACT ON JOINT PAIN AND VARIOUS ASPECTS OF QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) THROUGH A YOGA PROGRAM. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK: SOCIAL COGNITIVE THEORY WAS USED AND PROVIDED THE FOUNDATION FOR DEVELOPING A YOGA INTERVENTION THROUGH SOURCES OF EFFICACY INFORMATION: (1) PERFORMANCE ACCOMPLISHMENT, (2) STRUCTURED EXPERIENCE, (3) VERBAL SUPPORT FROM INSTRUCTOR AND GROUP, AND (4) PHYSICAL FEEDBACK. METHODOLOGY: TEN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WITH STAGE I-III BREAST CANCER AND AI ASSOCIATED ARTHRALGIA (AIAA) RECEIVED YOGA TWICE A WEEK FOR EIGHT WEEKS FOR 90 MINUTES AND WERE INSTRUCTED TO CONTINUE IN A HOME-BASED YOGA PROGRAM. WE USED SOCIAL COGNITIVE THEORY (SCT) TO STRUCTURE A YOGA INTERVENTION AS AN ONGOING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO MANAGE JOINT PAIN AND FUNCTION. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED JOURNAL REFLECTIONS ON THEIR EXPERIENCE AND RECEIVED WEEKLY PHONE CALLS. ANALYSIS: DATA WAS COLLECTED AND ANALYZED USING QUALITATIVE METHODS. MEMBER CHECKS WERE COMPLETED AND EMERGENT THEMES WERE EXPLORED AND AGREED UPON BY THE RESEARCH TEAM TO ENSURE RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY OF DATA. SEVERAL EMERGENT THEMES WERE DISCOVERED: EMPOWERMENT: IMPORTANCE OF CAMARADERIE, COMMUNITY, AND SHARING; PAIN RELIEF; INCREASED PHYSICAL FITNESS (ENERGY, FLEXIBILITY, AND FUNCTION); RELIEVED STRESS/ANXIETY AND TRANSFERABILITY OF YOGA THROUGH BREATHING. THESE THEMES WERE IDENTIFIED THROUGH INSTRUCTOR OBSERVATION, PARTICIPANT OBSERVATION, AND WEEKLY PHONE CALL DOCUMENTATION. INTERPRETATION: PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCED AN EIGHT-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION AS AN EFFECTIVE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND SUPPORT GROUP THAT FOSTERED VARIOUS IMPROVEMENTS IN QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AND REDUCTION IN AIAA. PARTICIPANTS WERE HIGHLY MOTIVATED TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL FITNESS LEVELS AND REDUCE PAIN. THIS STUDY REVEALED BENEFITS FROM ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF EXERCISE SUCH AS YOGA TO PROVIDE A STRUCTURE, WHICH IS TRANSFERABLE IN OTHER SITUATIONS. INFORMATION, STRUCTURED PHYSICAL GUIDANCE IN YOGA POSTURES, SUPPORT, AND FEEDBACK ARE NECESSARY TO FOSTER PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOR BCS EXPERIENCING PAIN. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: RESULTS OF THIS QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS INDICATE THAT INTERVENTIONS TO SUPPORT BCS WITH AIAA ARE WARRANTED. YOGA APPEARS TO POSITIVELY IMPACT THESE SIDE EFFECTS OF HORMONAL THERAPIES. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH WOULD AID IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER INTERVENTIONS.	2012	

5  156 30 A QUALITATIVE STUDY OF LOVEYOURBRAIN YOGA: A GROUP-BASED YOGA WITH PSYCHOEDUCATION INTERVENTION TO FACILITATE COMMUNITY INTEGRATION FOR PEOPLE WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. PURPOSE: TO EXPLORE PARTICIPANTS' EXPERIENCES IN A GROUP-BASED YOGA WITH PSYCHOEDUCATION INTERVENTION DESIGNED TO FACILITATE COMMUNITY INTEGRATION FOR PEOPLE WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS.MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE CONDUCTED SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH 13 PEOPLE WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND THREE CAREGIVERS WHO HAD COMPLETED LOVEYOURBRAIN YOGA, A 6-SESSION, MANUALIZED, GROUP-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION THAT INCORPORATES BREATHING EXERCISES, YOGA, MEDITATION, AND PSYCHOEDUCATION. INTERVIEWS WERE ANALYZED USING CONTENT ANALYSIS.RESULTS: WE IDENTIFIED SEVEN THEMES: EASE OF PARTICIPATION, BELONGING, SUSTAINING COMMUNITY CONNECTION, PHYSICAL HEALTH, SELF-REGULATION, SELF-EFFICACY, AND RESILIENCE. ALL PARTICIPANTS VALUED THE COMMUNITY-BASED YOGA STUDIO ENVIRONMENT AND MULTIFACETED STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM. PARTICIPANTS REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN STRENGTH, BALANCE, FLEXIBILITY, AND ATTENTION CONTROL, AND A GREATER SENSE OF BELONGING, COMMUNITY CONNECTION, AND ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR LIVES. PARTICIPANTS REPORTED ONGOING USE OF TOOLS (E.G., BREATHING EXERCISES) TO COPE WITH NEGATIVE EMOTIONS AND STRESS. ABOUT HALF OF PARTICIPANTS SUSTAINED RELATIONSHIPS BUILT DURING LOVEYOURBRAIN YOGA AND FELT MORE CAPABLE OF ACCESSING OTHER ACTIVITIES IN THEIR COMMUNITY.CONCLUSIONS: LOVEYOURBRAIN YOGA SUCCESSFULLY PROMOTED COMMUNITY INTEGRATION FOR PEOPLE WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY. IT ALSO FACILITATED DIVERSE AND MEANINGFUL PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND SOCIAL HEALTH BENEFITS, WHICH SUGGEST THAT IT MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE MODE OF COMMUNITY-BASED REHABILITATION.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONTRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY SURVIVORS OFTEN STRUGGLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR COMMUNITY, THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF REHABILITATIONYOGA IS A HOLISTIC THERAPY WITH MANY BENEFITS, YET IS NOT ACCESSIBLE TO THE TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY POPULATION AT THE COMMUNITY LEVELPARTICIPANTS IN A COMMUNITY-BASED YOGA WITH PSYCHOEDUCATION INTERVENTION IN SIX STATES EXPERIENCED DIVERSE AND MEANINGFUL PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND SOCIAL HEALTH BENEFITSGROUP-BASED YOGA WITH PSYCHOEDUCATION MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE MODE OF COMMUNITY INTEGRATION AND COMMUNITY-BASED REHABILITATION FOR TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY SURVIVORS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
6   10 29 "MAKING IT OKAY": PROFESSIONALS IN HIGH-STRESS ENVIRONMENTS CONSTRUCT THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT OF A YOGA-BASED RETREAT DESIGNED TO BUILD RESILIENCE. PURPOSE: WHILE THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE FOR RESILIENCE BUILDING PROGRAMMES, TO DATE RESEARCH HAS NOT EXPLORED HOW PROFESSIONALS CONSTRUCT UNDERSTANDING OF PROGRAMME IMPACT. RISE (RESILIENCE, INTEGRATION, SELF-AWARENESS, ENGAGEMENT), A 5-DAY YOGA-BASED RETREAT PROGRAMME, HAS BEEN LINKED WITH POSITIVE WELLNESS OUTCOMES. THIS QUALITATIVE INQUIRY EXPLORES PARTICIPANTS' REFLECTION AND EXPERIENCE 3 MONTHS AFTER PROGRAMME COMPLETION. METHODS: THROUGH A GROUNDED CONSTRUCTIVIST LENS, IN-DEPTH SEMI-STRUCTURED PHONE INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH 17 ADULT PROFESSIONALS IN HIGH-STRESS WORK ENVIRONMENTS WHO ATTENDED RISE. INITIAL HAND-CODING INFORMED CODEBOOK DEVELOPMENT FOR SYSTEMATIC CODING USING DIRECTED CONTENT ANALYSIS USING SENSITIZING STRUCTURING. RESULTS: TWO INTEGRATED PERCEPTIONS WOVEN THROUGH FIVE THEMES. PERSISTENT THREADS OF EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING AND SENSE OF PERMISSION PROVIDED STRUCTURE FOR THEMES FOUND.

7 2032 25 TAILORING TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA FOR HIGH-RISK POPULATIONS IN PUBLIC-SECTOR SETTINGS. LOW-INCOME, RACIAL-MINORITY, HIGH-RISK POPULATIONS HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENTS FOR POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD), AND THEIR ACCEPTANCE OF COMPLEMENTARY INTERVENTIONS IS UNKNOWN. TRAUMA CENTER TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA (TC-TSY), WHICH HAS DEMONSTRATED EFFICACY IN COMMUNITY SAMPLES, HAS NOT YET BEEN WIDELY USED WITH ETHNIC MINORITY LOW-INCOME INDIVIDUALS. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A CULTURALLY TAILORED VERSION OF A TC-TSY INTERVENTION DELIVERED AS A DROP-IN SERVICE IN A PUBLIC HOSPITAL-BASED CLINIC TO PATIENTS WITH HISTORIES OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE AND SUICIDE ATTEMPTS. TC-TSY WAS ITERATIVELY TAILORED TO MEET THE UNIQUE CLINICAL NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS WITHIN THIS SETTING. GROUP FACILITATOR OBSERVATIONS ARE SUMMARIZED; THEY DESCRIBE A SUCCESSFUL INITIAL IMPLEMENTATION AND CULTURALLY INFORMED ADAPTATION OF THE GROUP INTERVENTION. THE FACILITATORS' OBSERVATIONS ILLUSTRATED THAT GROUP MEMBERS ACCEPTED THE INTEGRATION OF THIS STRUCTURED, GENTLE YOGA PRACTICE INTO OUTPATIENT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROGRAMMING AND IDENTIFIED SITE-SPECIFIC MODIFICATIONS TO INFORM FORMAL STUDY. THE PROCESS BY WHICH TC-TSY WAS ADAPTED AND IMPLEMENTED FOR BLACK INDIVIDUALS WITH A HISTORY OF INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA AT RISK FOR SUICIDAL BEHAVIOR CAN SERVE AS A GUIDE FOR TAILORING OTHER COMPLEMENTARY, INTEGRATIVE INTERVENTIONS TO MEET THE NEEDS OF UNIQUE CLINICAL SETTINGS. THIS PROCESS IS OFFERED AS A FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE SYSTEMATIC TESTING OF THIS COMPLEMENTARY, INTEGRATED, CULTURALLY ADAPTED TRAUMA THERAPY IN HIGH-RISK CLINICAL POPULATIONS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
8   61 23 A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF YOGA RESEARCH IN 2020. OBJECTIVES: ACCUMULATED EVIDENCE GARNERED IN THE LAST FEW DECADES HAS HIGHLIGHTED THE ROLE OF YOGA IN HEALTH AND DISEASE. THE OVERWHELMING MORTALITY AND MORBIDITY MEDIATED BY NONCOMMUNICABLE EPIDEMICS SUCH AS HEART DISEASE AND CANCER HAVE FOSTERED A SEARCH FOR MECHANISMS TO ATTENUATE THEM. DESPITE OVERWHELMING SUCCESS IN ACUTE CARE, THE EFFICACY OF MODERN MEDICINES HAS BEEN LIMITED ON THIS FRONT. YOGA IS ONE OF THE INTEGRATIVE THERAPIES THAT HAS COME TO LIGHT AS HAVING A SUBSTANTIAL ROLE IN PREVENTING AND MITIGATING SUCH DISORDERS. IT THUS SEEMS TRITE TO ANALYZE AND DISCUSS THE RESEARCH ADVANCEMENTS IN YOGA FOR 2020. THE PRESENT REVIEW ATTEMPTS TO DISTILL RECENT RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS FROM VOLUMINOUS LITERATURE GENERATED IN 2020. METHODS: THIS REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED ON THE ARTICLES PUBLISHED OR ASSIGNED TO AN ISSUE IN 2020. THE AUTHORS SEARCHED THE PUBMED DATABASE FOR CLINICAL STUDIES PUBLISHED IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE, USING YOGA (INCLUDING MEDITATION) AS THE INTERVENTION, AND HAVING AN ADEQUATE DESCRIPTION OF THE INTERVENTION. THEN, THEY EXTRACTED DATA FROM EACH STUDY INTO A STANDARDIZED GOOGLE SHEET. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 1149 CITATIONS WERE RETRIEVED IN THE INITIAL SEARCH. OF THESE, 46 STUDIES MET ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND WERE FINALLY INCLUDED. THE STUDIES WERE PREDOMINANTLY ON MENTAL HEALTH AND NEUROPSYCHOLOGY, ADDRESSING VARIOUS ISSUES SUCH AS ANXIETY, POSTURAL BALANCE, MIGRAINE, ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE, AND CHILDHOOD NEGLECT. ANXIETY, STRESS, AND DEPRESSION WERE OTHER COMMON DENOMINATORS. EIGHT STUDIES WERE ON CARDIORESPIRATORY SYSTEMS, INCLUDING EXERCISE CAPACITY, CARDIAC REHABILITATION, MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, AND HYPERTENSION. THREE STUDIES WERE ON DIABETES, EVALUATING THE EFFECT OF YOGA. FIVE STUDIES FOCUSED ON COGNITION, HEALTH STATUS, AND AUTONOMIC REGULATION AND FEW OTHERS INCLUDED CANCERS, INFERTILITY, ULCERATIVE COLITIS, URINARY INCONTINENCE, RESTLESS LEG SYNDROME, RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, CHRONIC PAIN, AND METABOLIC SYNDROME. FINALLY, MOST STUDIES WERE ON NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES WITH ONE EXCEPTION, HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS; TWO RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE DEDICATED TO IT. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA HAS BEEN STUDIED UNDER A WIDE VARIETY OF CLINICOPATHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS IN THE YEAR 2020. THIS LANDSCAPE REVIEW INTENDS TO PROVIDE AN IDEA OF THE ROLE OF YOGA IN VARIOUS CLINICAL CONDITIONS AND ITS FUTURE THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATIONS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
9  250 28 A YOGA INTERVENTION PROGRAM FOR PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM SYMPTOMS OF POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER: A QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTIVE STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO UNDERSTAND HOW INDIVIDUALS WITH SYMPTOMS OF POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) PERCEIVE A TRAUMA-SENSITIVE KUNDALINI YOGA (KY) PROGRAM. METHODS: DIGITALLY RECORDED TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS 30-60 MINUTES IN DURATION WERE CONDUCTED WITH 40 INDIVIDUALS WITH PTSD PARTICIPATING IN AN 8-WEEK KY TREATMENT PROGRAM. INTERVIEWS WERE TRANSCRIBED VERBATIM AND ANALYZED USING QUALITATIVE THEMATIC ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES. RESULTS: QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS IDENTIFIES THREE MAJOR THEMES: SELF-OBSERVED CHANGES, NEW AWARENESS, AND THE YOGA PROGRAM ITSELF. FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT PARTICIPANTS NOTED CHANGES IN AREAS OF HEALTH AND WELL-BEING, LIFESTYLE, PSYCHOSOCIAL INTEGRATION, AND PERCEPTIONS OF SELF IN RELATION TO THE WORLD. PRESENTED ARE PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS FOR TRAUMA-RELATED PROGRAMMING. CONCLUSION: THERE IS A NEED TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE AND POTENTIALLY EMPOWERING APPROACHES TO TRAUMA TREATMENT. YOGA-RELATED SELF-CARE OR SELF-MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES ARE WIDELY ACCESSIBLE, ARE EMPOWERING, AND MAY ADDRESS THE MIND-BODY ELEMENTS OF PTSD.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
10  148 24 A QUALITATIVE EXPLORATION OF IMPLEMENTATION FACTORS IN A SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PROGRAM: LESSONS LEARNED FROM STUDENTS AND TEACHERS. IDENTIFYING FACTORS RELEVANT FOR SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF SCHOOL-BASED INTERVENTIONS IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THAT PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED IN AN EFFECTIVE AND ENGAGING MANNER. THE PERSPECTIVES OF TWO KEY STAKEHOLDERS CRITICAL FOR IDENTIFYING IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS - STUDENTS AND THEIR CLASSROOM TEACHERS - MERIT ATTENTION IN THIS CONTEXT AND HAVE RARELY BEEN EXPLORED USING QUALITATIVE METHODS. THIS STUDY REPORTS QUALITATIVE PERSPECTIVES OF FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADE PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR TEACHERS OF A 16-WEEK SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PROGRAM IN THREE PUBLIC SCHOOLS SERVING LOW-INCOME URBAN COMMUNITIES. FOUR THEMES RELATED TO PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS EMERGED: PROGRAM DELIVERY FACTORS, PROGRAM BUY-IN, IMPLEMENTER COMMUNICATION WITH TEACHERS, AND INSTRUCTOR QUALITIES. FEEDBACK FROM STUDENTS AND TEACHERS IS DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT OF INFORMING IMPLEMENTATION, ADAPTATION, AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PROGRAMMING IN URBAN SETTINGS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
11 2313 25 TRAUMA SURVIVORS' EXPERIENCES OF KUNDALINI YOGA IN FOSTERING POSTTRAUMATIC GROWTH. THE PREVALENCE OF TRAUMATIC EVENTS IN SOUTH AFRICA IS CONSIDERABLY HIGH DUE TO A HISTORY OF POLITICAL VIOLENCE AND THE ONGOING CYCLE OF INTERPERSONAL, COMMUNITY-BASED, AND SOCIOECONOMIC VIOLENCE. WHILE CONVENTIONAL THERAPEUTIC TECHNIQUES HAVE BEEN FOUND TO SUPPORT TRAUMA SURVIVORS IN THE LOCAL CONTEXT, ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES THAT FOCUS ON THE MIND-BODY CONNECTION HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY POPULAR. HOWEVER, STUDIES REPORTING ON THE USE OF THESE APPROACHES REMAIN SCARCE. THIS STUDY AIMED TO ADD TO THE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE ON YOGA AS A NON-CONVENTIONAL THERAPY TO SUPPORT TRAUMA SURVIVORS AND FOSTER POSTTRAUMATIC GROWTH. SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH A SAMPLE OF SEVEN KUNDALINI YOGA PRACTITIONERS WHO HAD BEEN EXPOSED TO TRAUMA. A THEMATIC ANALYSIS CONFIRMED THAT KUNDALINI YOGA WAS BENEFICIAL IN FOSTERING POSTTRAUMATIC GROWTH.

13  491 23 CO-DESIGNING A NEW YOGA-BASED MINDFULNESS INTERVENTION FOR SURVIVORS OF STROKE: A FORMATIVE EVALUATION. MOVEMENT-BASED MINDFULNESS INTERVENTIONS (MBI) ARE COMPLEX, MULTI-COMPONENT INTERVENTIONS FOR WHICH THE DESIGN PROCESS IS RARELY REPORTED. FOR PEOPLE WITH STROKE, EMERGING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS BENEFITS, BUT MAINSTREAM PROGRAMS ARE GENERALLY UNSUITABLE. WE AIMED TO DESCRIBE THE PROCESSES INVOLVED AND TO CONDUCT A FORMATIVE EVALUATION OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL YOGA-BASED MBI DESIGNED FOR SURVIVORS OF STROKE. WE USED THE MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL COMPLEX INTERVENTIONS FRAMEWORK AND PRINCIPLES OF CO-DESIGN. WE PURPOSEFULLY APPROACHED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND CONSUMERS TO ESTABLISH AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR DEVELOPING THE INTERVENTION. MEMBERS COLLABORATED AND ITERATIVELY REVIEWED THE DESIGN AND CONTENT OF THE PROGRAM, FORMATTED INTO A TRAINING MANUAL. FOUR EXTERNAL YOGA TEACHERS INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWED THE PROGRAM. FORMATIVE EVALUATION INCLUDED REVIEW OF MULTIPLE DATA SOURCES AND DOCUMENTATION (E.G., FORMAL MEETING MINUTES, FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS, RESEARCHER OBSERVATIONS). THE DATA WERE SYNTHESIZED USING INDUCTIVE THEMATIC ANALYSIS. THREE BROAD THEMES EMERGED: (A) MBI CONTENT AND TERMINOLOGY; (B) MANUAL DESIGN AND READABILITY; AND (C) BARRIERS AND ENABLERS TO DELIVER THE INTERVENTION. VARIOUS PERSPECTIVES AND FEEDBACK ON ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS GUIDED FINALIZING THE PROGRAM. THE DESIGN PHASE OF A NOVEL YOGA-BASED MBI WAS STRENGTHENED BY INTERDISCIPLINARY, CONSUMER CONTRIBUTIONS AND PEER REVIEW. THE 12-WEEK INTERVENTION IS READY FOR TESTING AMONG SURVIVORS OF STROKE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
14  151 30 A QUALITATIVE INVESTIGATION TO INFORM YOGA INTERVENTION RECRUITMENT PRACTICES FOR RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY ADOLESCENTS IN OUTPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. OBJECTIVE: YOGA IS RECOGNIZED AS AN EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO IMPROVING OVERALL PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH; HOWEVER, THERE MAY BE PERCEIVED BARRIERS TO YOGA PARTICIPATION, PARTICULARLY AMONG POPULATIONS MOST AT RISK FOR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. WE CONDUCTED QUALITATIVE FORMATIVE RESEARCH TO HELP INFORM RECRUITMENT PRACTICES FOR A FUTURE STUDY AND TO SPECIFICALLY UNDERSTAND THE BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO ENGAGEMENT IN YOGA PRACTICE AMONG RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY ADOLESCENTS, AS WELL AS ADOLESCENTS IN OUTPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. METHODS: QUALITATIVE DATA WERE COLLECTED AT A COMMUNITY HEALTH CLINIC THAT SERVES LOW INCOME FAMILIES IN SOUTHEASTERN FLORIDA. USING SEMI STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY ADOLESCENTS BETWEEN 12 AND 17 YEARS OLD, PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED ABOUT BELIEFS AND PERCEPTIONS ABOUT YOGA, AS WELL AS RECOMMENDATIONS ON RECRUITING PEERS. A THEMATIC ANALYSIS APPROACH WAS USED TO IDENTIFY AND EXAMINE COMMON THEMES. RESULTS: TWENTY INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED AND EIGHT MAJOR THEMES EMERGED FROM THE DATA. THEMES WERE GROUPED AS (1) FACILITATORS TO RECRUITMENT AND (2) BARRIERS TO RECRUITMENT. INTERPRETATION: ADVERTISING FREE YOGA THAT EMPHASIZES THE SOCIAL, PHYSICAL, AND MENTAL BENEFITS CAN HELP ASSUAGE NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OF YOGA AND PROMOTE THE ADVANTAGES OF YOGA AMONG TEENAGERS. HAVING RECRUITMENT MATERIALS AND MODALITIES THAT HIGHLIGHT INCLUSIVITY OF ALL GENDERS AND PHYSICAL ABILITIES IN THE YOGA CLASSES ARE ALSO IMPORTANT IN FACILITATING PARTICIPATION. UNDERSTANDING PERCEPTIONS OF YOGA, AS WELL AS PERCEIVED BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS, AMONG RACIALLY/ETHNICALLY DIVERSE ADOLESCENTS IN OUTPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT, CAN ASSIST RECRUITMENT EFFORTS, INCREASE YOGA INTERVENTION PARTICIPATION, AND ULTIMATELY, IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
15  421 23 BRIDGING BODY AND MIND: CONSIDERATIONS FOR TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA. INDIVIDUALS WHO SUFFER FROM TRAUMA-RELATED SYMPTOMS ARE A UNIQUE POPULATION THAT COULD BENEFIT FROM THE MIND-BODY PRACTICE OF YOGA-OR HAVE THEIR SYMPTOMS REACTIVATED BY IT, DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF YOGA. TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA (TIY), THAT IS, YOGA ADAPTED TO THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS WORKING TO OVERCOME TRAUMA, MAY AMELIORATE SYMPTOMS BY CREATING A SAFE, TAILORED PRACTICE FOR STUDENTS TO LEARN HOW TO RESPOND, RATHER THAN REACT, TO SYMPTOMS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. YOGA NOT THUS ADAPTED, ON THE OTHER HAND, MAY INCREASE REACTIVITY AND ACTIVATE SYMPTOMS SUCH AS HYPERAROUSAL OR DISSOCIATION. THIS ARTICLE REPORTS ON EXPERT INPUT ABOUT ADAPTING YOGA FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH TRAUMA, WITH SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR MILITARY POPULATIONS. ELEVEN EXPERTS, RECRUITED BASED ON LITERATURE REVIEW AND REFERRALS, WERE INTERVIEWED IN PERSON OR VIA TELEPHONE AND ASKED SEVEN QUESTIONS ABOUT TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA. VERBATIM TRANSCRIPTS WERE SUBJECTED TO OPEN-CODING THEMATIC ANALYSIS AND A PRIORI THEMES. FINDINGS REVEALED THAT TIY NEEDS TO EMPHASIZE BENEFICIAL PRACTICES (E.G., DIAPHRAGMATIC BREATH AND RESTORATIVE POSTURES), CONSIDER CONTRAINDICATIONS (E.G., AVOIDING SEQUENCES THAT OVERLY ENGAGE THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM), ADAPT TO LIMITATIONS AND CHALLENGES FOR TEACHING IN UNCONVENTIONAL SETTINGS (E.G., PRISONS, VA HOSPITALS), AND PROVIDE SPECIALIZED TRAINING AND PREPARATION (E.G., SPECIALIZED TIY CERTIFICATIONS, SELF-CARE OF INSTRUCTORS/THERAPISTS, ADAPTIONS FOR STUDENT NEEDS). TIY FOR VETERANS MUST ADDITIONALLY CONSIDER GENDER- AND CULTURE-RELATED BARRIERS, DIFFERING RELATIONSHIPS TO PAIN AND INJURY, AND MEDICATION AS A BARRIER TO PRACTICE.	2018

MOTIVATION FOR PROGRAM INITIATION AND ADHERENCE, BENEFITS AND BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATION, AND INDIVIDUAL SATISFACTION AND FEEDBACK ON PROGRAM IMPROVEMENT WERE DISCUSSED. AUDIO RECORDINGS WERE TRANSCRIBED AND ANALYZED USING THEMATIC METHODOLOGY GUIDED BY A PRAGMATIC PHILOSOPHY ON THE PATIENT EXPERIENCE IN THE PROGRAM. RESULTS: THEMES IDENTIFIED INCLUDED PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF PARTICIPATING (PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND SOCIAL), FACILITATORS FOR INVOLVEMENT IN THE PA PROGRAM (PROGRAM DESIGN, INITIAL FREE ACCESS, TAILORED TO PROSTATE CANCER SPECIFIC NEEDS, PSYCHOSOCIAL ENVIRONMENT), AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY (EXERCISE AS A PART OF STANDARD CARE, COST STRUCTURE, HOME-BASED OPTIONS). CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS PROVIDE VALUABLE INSIGHT INTO PATIENT PERSPECTIVES ON EFFECTIVE CHARACTERISTICS OF PROSTATE CANCER AND EXERCISE PROGRAMS. TRUENTH LM HAS IMPLEMENTED FINDINGS, AND ENSURING NEEDS (BENEFITS AND BARRIERS) ARE ADDRESSED FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS WHEN ENTERING COMMUNITY-BASED PA PROGRAMS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
17   21 26 "YOGA RESETS MY INNER PEACE BAROMETER": A QUALITATIVE STUDY ILLUMINATING THE PATHWAYS OF HOW YOGA IMPACTS ONE'S RELATIONSHIP TO ONESELF AND TO OTHERS. OBJECTIVES: THE PURPOSE OF THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY WAS TWOFOLD: (1) TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW YOGA PRACTITIONERS PERCEIVE INTRA- AND INTERPERSONAL OUTCOMES OF THEIR YOGA PRACTICE, AND (2) TO DEVELOP A CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF YOGA EFFECTS ON INTRA- AND INTERPERSONAL OUTCOMES THAT MAY UNDERLIE THE "RELATIONAL" INFLUENCES OF YOGA. DESIGN: AS PART OF A LARGER STUDY, 107 COMMUNITY-DWELLING YOGA PRACTITIONERS (AGE M=41.2+/-15.9YEARS) COMPLETED OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS WHICH ASKED QUESTIONS FOCUSING ON WHETHER YOGA INFLUENCES ONE'S RELATIONSHIP TO ONESELF AND TO OTHERS. A SUBSAMPLE (N=12) COMPLETED IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS. THE OPEN-ENDED RESPONSES WERE ANALYZED USING CONTENT ANALYSIS, AND VERBATIM INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTS WERE ANALYZED FOR EMERGENT THEMES USING A CONSTANT COMPARISON APPROACH. RESULTS: FOUR EMERGING THEMES WERE IDENTIFIED SUCH THAT PRACTITIONERS TALKED ABOUT THE ABILITY OF YOGA TO GENERATE CALM STATES, MINDFULNESS, (SELF-)COMPASSION, AND A SENSE OF CONNECTEDNESS. THROUGHOUT THE THEMES, A COMMON PATTERN EMERGED SUCH THAT YOGA PRACTICE FIRST LED TO POSITIVE INTRAPERSONAL CHANGES, WHICH THEN INFLUENCED ONE'S INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS. BASED ON THESE RESULTS, A CONCEPTUAL MODEL WAS DEVELOPED DEPICTING POTENTIAL PATHWAYS OF HOW YOGA WORKS TO ENHANCE RELATIONAL OUTCOMES. CONCLUSION: FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE THE PROMISE YOGA HOLDS TO IMPROVE ONE'S RELATIONSHIP TO ONESELF (INTRAPERSONAL) THROUGH MINDFULNESS AND SELF-COMPASSION, AND TO OTHERS (INTERPERSONAL), THROUGH THE ENHANCEMENT OF COMPASSION AND SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS, WHICH MAY POTENTIALLY LEAD TO ENHANCED HEALTH AND WELLBEING OUTCOMES. FURTHER EMPIRICAL TESTING OF THE MODEL IS WARRANTED.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
18 2380 31 WOMEN'S EXPERIENCES OF PARTICIPATION IN A PREGNANCY AND POSTNATAL GROUP INCORPORATING YOGA AND FACILITATED GROUP DISCUSSION: A QUALITATIVE EVALUATION. BACKGROUND: THIS PAPER REPORTS ON A SMALL QUALITATIVE RESEARCH STUDY WHICH EXPLORED WOMEN'S EXPERIENCES OF PARTICIPATION IN A PREGNANCY AND POSTNATAL GROUP THAT INCORPORATED YOGA AND FACILITATED DISCUSSION. THE GROUP IS OFFERED THROUGH A COMMUNITY BASED FEMINIST NON-GOVERNMENT WOMEN'S HEALTH CENTRE IN NORTHERN NSW AUSTRALIA. QUESTION: THE PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH WAS TO EXPLORE WOMEN'S EXPERIENCES OF ATTENDING THIS PREGNANCY AND POSTNATAL GROUP. METHODS: AN EXPLORATORY QUALITATIVE APPROACH WAS USED TO EXPLORE WOMEN'S EXPERIENCES OF ATTENDING THE GROUP. FIFTEEN WOMEN PARTICIPATED IN INDIVIDUAL, IN-DEPTH FACE-TO-FACE INTERVIEWS. INTERVIEWS WERE RECORDED AND TRANSCRIBED VERBATIM. THEMATIC ANALYSIS WAS UNDERTAKEN TO ANALYSE THE QUALITATIVE DATA. FINDINGS: SIX THEMES WERE DEVELOPED, ONE WITH 3 SUBTHEMES. ONE THEME WAS LABELLED AS: 'THE PREGNANCY AND MOTHERHOOD JOURNEY' AND INCLUDED 3 SUB-THEMES WHICH WERE LABELLED: 'PREPARATION FOR BIRTH', 'CONNECTING WITH THE BABY' AND 'SHARING BIRTH STORIES.' THE OTHER FIVE THEMES WERE: 'FEMININE NURTURING SAFE SPACE', 'WATCHING AND LEARNING THE MOTHERING', 'BUILDING MENTAL HEALTH, WELL-BEING AND CONNECTIONS', THE "GROUP LIKE A ROCK AND A SEED' AND 'DIFFERENT FROM MAINSTREAM'. CONCLUSION: THIS RESEARCH ADDS TO THE OVERALL BODY OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE VALUE OF YOGA IN PRE AND POSTNATAL CARE. IT DEMONSTRATES THE VALUE OF SHARING BIRTH STORIES AND THE STRONG CAPACITY WOMEN HAVE TO SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER, BRINGING BENEFITS OF EMOTIONAL AND SOCIAL WELL-BEING, INFORMATION, RESOURCES AND SUPPORT DERIVED FROM GROUP BASED MODELS OF CARE.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
19  129 31 A POPULATION-PRACTICE-BASED MODEL TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOGA IMPACTS ON HUMAN GLOBAL FUNCTIONING: A QUALITATIVE STUDY. INTRODUCTION:RESEARCH IS INCREASINGLY DEMONSTRATING A RANGE OF BENEFITS OF PRACTICING YOGA, SUCH AS IMPROVED PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH, SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS, AND SELF-CARE. MECHANISMS OF ACTION ARE LESS WELL UNDERSTOOD, BUT MAY INCLUDE BOTH PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT BENEFITS AND MECHANISMS OF YOGA PRACTICE, USING QUALITATIVE DATA COLLECTED FROM A LARGE-SCALE SURVEY OF YOGA USE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. METHODS: THE MIXED METHODS, CROSS-SECTIONAL ONLINE SURVEY COLLECTED DATA ON YOGA USE AND PERCEIVED BENEFITS FROM 2434 U.K. YOGA PRACTITIONERS. THE QUALITATIVE SURVEY ELEMENT USED OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS TO GAIN "REAL LIFE" DATA REGARDING PRACTICE AND PERCEIVED BENEFITS. DATA WERE ANALYZED THEMATICALLY AND DEDUCTIVELY. A PRACTICE-BASED MODEL DESCRIBING YOGA PRACTICE, MECHANISMS, AND BENEFITS, BASED ON THE KHALSA LOGIC MODEL OF YOGA, WAS DEVELOPED TO EXPLAIN THE DATA. FINDINGS: FINDINGS HIGHLIGHTED THAT A DIVERSE RANGE OF YOGA PRACTICES AND NONSPECIFIC CONTEXTUAL FACTORS RELATED TO PRACTICING YOGA, NEEDED TO BE CONSIDERED TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOGA WAS BENEFITTING PEOPLE. THESE PRACTICES ENCOMPASSED BOTH MODERN AND TRADITIONAL CONCEPTIONS OF YOGA AS A DEEPER LIFESTYLE PRACTICE. KEY MECHANISMS FOR CHANGE INCLUDED IMPROVEMENTS IN PHYSICAL STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY, STRESS REGULATION, RESILIENCE, EQUANIMITY, MIND-BODY AWARENESS, AND SPIRITUAL/PERSONAL GROWTH. THESE MECHANISMS RESULTED IN DIVERSE IMPROVEMENTS IN GLOBAL HEALTH FUNCTIONING, PARTICULARLY PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. CONCLUSIONS: THE KHALSA MODEL PROVIDED A USEFUL BASE UPON WHICH TO GUIDE THE NEW POPULATION-PRACTICE-BASED MODEL, TO UNDERSTAND PARTICIPANTS' "REAL LIFE" EXPERIENCES OF YOGA, HOW YOGA IS HELPING PEOPLE AND WHY. IT PROVIDES IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PRACTITIONERS, TEACHERS, AND THOSE DELIVERING YOGA INTERVENTIONS AS TO THE RANGE OF SKILLS AND POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE. IN ADDITION, FINDINGS INDICATE DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH, BY HIGHLIGHTING KEY YOGA MECHANISMS THAT RESEARCHERS MAY CHOOSE TO FOCUS ON IN FUTURE STUDIES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
20 1145 29 ELEMENTARY STUDENT AND TEACHER PERCEPTIONS OF A MINDFULNESS AND YOGA-BASED PROGRAM IN SCHOOL: A QUALITATIVE EVALUATION. RESEARCH QUESTION: WHAT ARE THE QUALITATIVE INSIGHTS AND PERSPECTIVES ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A MINDFULNESS AND YOGA-BASED PROGRAM FROM ELEMENTARY YOUTH AND TEACHERS? CONTEXT: A MINDFULNESS AND YOGA-BASED CURRICULUM WAS IMPLEMENTED IN 15 SCHOOLS. THE CURRICULUM WAS TAUGHT TO STUDENTS DURING A PHYSICAL EDUCATION OR DANCE CLASS BY INSTRUCTORS WHO WERE WITHIN EACH SCHOOL AND RECEIVED TRAINING ON THE CURRICULUM. SAMPLE SELECTION: VOLUNTEER FOCUS GROUP ELEMENTARY STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATED FOR ONE YEAR AND TEACHERS WHO DID NOT IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM WERE QUALITATIVELY INTERVIEWED, BY THREE TRAINED UNIVERSITY RESEARCHERS. DATA COLLECTION: NINE FOCUS GROUPS WERE COMPLETED WITHIN THREE DIFFERENT ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. SIX FOCUS GROUPS WERE COMPLETED WITH 3RD AND 5TH GRADE STUDENTS. THREE FOCUS GROUPS WERE CONDUCTED WITH TEACHERS WITHIN EACH SCHOOL WHICH RECEIVED THE PROGRAM, EXCLUDING INSTRUCTORS. ANALYSIS: FOCUS GROUP DATA WERE CODED AND A THEMATIC ANALYSIS WAS COMPLETED AMONG THE 40 STUDENTS AND 23 TEACHERS. INTERPRETATION AND MAIN RESULTS: TEACHERS HAD VARYING DEGREES OF INVOLVEMENT WITH THE PROGRAM AND COMMUNICATION EMERGED AS A CRITICAL THEME FOR BUY-IN AS COMMUNICATION REPRESENTS THE UNDERPINNINGS OF CREATING AND RETAINING STAKEHOLDERS. MOST STUDENTS TALKED ABOUT PERCEIVED IMPROVEMENTS IN FOCUS, EMOTIONAL REGULATION, FLEXIBILITY, BREATHING, AND SCHOOL WORK. A COMMON THEME TO DESCRIBE BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM EMERGED WITH THE IDEA OF "INCREASED FOCUS". CONCEPTUALLY, IT MAY BE THAT INCREASING MINDFULNESS INCREASES "FOCUS" THUS INCREASING POSITIVE OUTCOMES. MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND IF "FOCUS" MAY SERVE AS A MEDIATING VARIABLE ON EMOTIONAL REGULATION, COGNITIVE IMPROVEMENTS, AND OTHER HEALTH OUTCOMES.	2020

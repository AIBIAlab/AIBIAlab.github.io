1 2333 96 TWELVE-MINUTE DAILY YOGA REGIMEN REVERSES OSTEOPOROTIC BONE LOSS. OBJECTIVE: ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SELECTED YOGA POSTURES IN RAISING BONE MINERAL DENSITY (BMD). METHODS: TEN-YEAR STUDY OF 741 INTERNET-RECRUITED VOLUNTEERS COMPARING PREYOGA BMD CHANGES WITH POSTYOGA BMD CHANGES. OUTCOME MEASURES: DUAL-ENERGY X-RAY ABSORPTIOMETRIC SCANS. OPTIONAL RADIOGRAPHS OF HIPS AND SPINE AND BONE QUALITY STUDY (7 TESLA). RESULTS: BONE MINERAL DENSITY IMPROVED IN SPINE, HIPS, AND FEMUR OF THE 227 MODERATELY AND FULLY COMPLIANT PATIENTS. MONTHLY GAIN IN BMD WAS SIGNIFICANT IN SPINE (0.0029 G/CM(2), P = .005) AND FEMUR (0.00022 G/CM(2), P = .053), BUT IN 1 COHORT, ALTHOUGH MEAN GAIN IN HIP BMD WAS 50%, LARGE INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES RAISED THE CONFIDENCE INTERVAL AND THE GAIN WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR TOTAL HIP (0.000357 G/CM(2)). NO YOGA-RELATED SERIOUS INJURIES WERE IMAGED OR REPORTED. BONE QUALITY APPEARED QUALITATIVELY IMPROVED IN YOGA PRACTITIONERS. CONCLUSION: YOGA APPEARS TO RAISE BMD IN THE SPINE AND THE FEMUR SAFELY.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
2  516 22 COMPARING COGNITION, COPING SKILLS AND VEDIC PERSONALITY OF INDIVIDUALS PRACTICING YOGA, PHYSICAL EXERCISE OR SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE: A CROSS-SECTIONAL FMRI STUDY. BACKGROUND: NATURE AND INTENSITY OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY MAY INFLUENCE COGNITION, COPING MECHANISMS AND OVERALL PERSONALITY OF AN INDIVIDUAL. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS TO COMPARE COGNITION, COPING STYLES AND VEDIC PERSONALITY AMONG INDIVIDUALS PRACTICING DIFFERENT LIFESTYLE. METHODS: THIRTY-NINE HEALTHY YOUNG ADULTS OF BOTH GENDER (27.63+/-4.04 YEARS) WERE RECRUITED AND CATEGORIZED INTO THREE GROUPS; I.E. YOGA, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OR SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE GROUPS. PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSESSED ON COGNITION, COPING STYLES AND VEDIC PERSONALITY INVENTORY (VPI). VERBAL-N-BACK AND STROOP TASKS WERE PERFORMED USING 3 TESLA MRI SCANNER. TASK BASED CONNECTIVITY (TBC) ANALYSIS WAS DONE USING CONN TOOLBOX IN SPM. RESULTS: THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE COGNITIVE DOMAINS ACROSS THE GROUPS. THE PLANNING (P=0.03) AND ACCEPTANCE DOMAIN (P=0.03) OF THE BRIEF COPE SCALE SHOWED DIFFERENCE ACROSS THE GROUPS. POST-HOC ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT PLANNING AND ACCEPTANCE SCORES WERE DISTINCTLY HIGHER IN THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY GROUP, HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY GROUP AND YOGA PRACTITIONERS. SIMILARLY, IN THE VPI, SATTVA (P=0.003), RAJAS (P=0.05) AND TAMAS (P=0.01) WERE DIFFERENT ACROSS THE GROUPS, AND THE POST HOC ANALYSIS SHOWED SUPERIORITY IN SATTVA SCORES IN YOGA GROUP, MEANWHILE, BOTH RAJAS AND TAMAS WERE HIGHER IN THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY GROUP. YOGA PRACTITIONERS PREFERENTIALLY RECRUITED LEFT SUPERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS IN RELATION TO THE PHYSICALLY ACTIVE GROUP AND PRECUNEUS IN RELATION TO THE SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE GROUP. CONCLUSION: THE STUDY REVEALED THAT YOGA PRACTITIONERS HAD A DISTINCT HIGHER SATTVA GUNA AND PREFERENTIALLY RECRUITED BRAIN AREAS ASSOCIATED WITH SELF-REGULATION AND INHIBITORY CONTROL.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
3  184 30 A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL TO ASSESS PAIN AND MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING-BASED (MRI-BASED) STRUCTURAL SPINE CHANGES IN LOW BACK PAIN PATIENTS AFTER YOGA PRACTICE. BACKGROUND THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED AT DETERMINING WHETHER 12 WEEKS OF YOGA PRACTICE IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LBP AND MRI-BASED DEGENERATIVE CHANGES WOULD RESULT IN DIFFERENCES IN: (I) SELF-REPORTED PAIN, ANXIETY, AND SPINAL FLEXIBILITY; AND (II) THE STRUCTURE OF THE DISCS OR VERTEBRAE. MATERIAL AND METHODS SIXTY-TWO PERSONS WITH MRI-PROVEN DEGENERATIVE INTERVERTEBRAL DISCS (GROUP MEAN +/-S.D., 36.2+/-6.4 YEARS; 30 FEMALES) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS. HOWEVER, TESTING WAS CONDUCTED ON ONLY 40 SUBJECTS, SO ONLY THEIR DATA ARE INCLUDED IN THIS STUDY. THE ASSESSMENTS WERE: SELF-REPORTED PAIN, STATE ANXIETY, SPINAL FLEXIBILITY, AND MRI OF THE LUMBOSACRAL SPINE, PERFORMED USING A 1.5 TESLA SYSTEM WITH A SPINAL SURFACE COLUMN. THE YOGA GROUP WAS TAUGHT LIGHT EXERCISES, PHYSICAL POSTURES, BREATHING TECHNIQUES, AND YOGA RELAXATION TECHNIQUES FOR 1 HOUR DAILY FOR 3 MONTHS. NO INTERVENTION WAS GIVEN TO THE CONTROL GROUP EXCEPT FOR ROUTINE MEDICAL CARE. A REPEATED-MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA) WITH POST HOC ANALYSES (WHICH WAS BONFERRONI-ADJUSTED) WAS USED. THE ETHICS COMMITTEE OF PATANJALI RESEARCH FOUNDATION HAD APPROVED THE STUDY WHICH HAD BEEN REGISTERED IN THE CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRY OF INDIA (CTRI/2012/11/003094). RESULTS THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SELF-REPORTED PAIN AND STATE ANXIETY IN A BEFORE/AFTER COMPARISON AT 12 WEEKS. A FEW PATIENTS IN BOTH GROUPS SHOWED CHANGES IN THE DISCS AND VERTEBRAE AT POST-INTERVENTION ASSESSMENT. CONCLUSIONS WITHIN 12 WEEKS, YOGA PRACTICE REDUCED PAIN AND STATE ANXIETY BUT DID NOT ALTER MRI-PROVEN CHANGES IN THE INTERVERTEBRAL DISCS AND IN THE VERTEBRAE.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
4  163 25 A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL OF THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON GUNAS (PERSONALITY) AND HEALTH IN NORMAL HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS. OBJECTIVE: TO STUDY THE EFFICACY OF YOGA ON GUNA (YOGIC PERSONALITY MEASURE) AND GENERAL HEALTH IN NORMAL ADULTS. METHODS: OF THE 1228 PERSONS WHO ATTENDED INTRODUCTORY LECTURES, 226 SUBJECTS AGED 18-71 YEARS, OF BOTH SEXES, WHO SATISFIED THE INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA AND WHO CONSENTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED INTO TWO GROUPS. THE YOGA(Y) GROUP PRACTISED AN INTEGRATED YOGA MODULE THAT INCLUDED ASANAS, PRANAYAMA, MEDITATION, NOTIONAL CORRECTION AND DEVOTIONAL SESSIONS. THE CONTROL GROUP PRACTISED MILD TO MODERATE PHYSICAL EXERCISES (PE). BOTH GROUPS HAD SUPERVISED PRACTICE SESSIONS (BY TRAINED EXPERTS) FOR ONE HOUR DAILY, SIX DAYS A WEEK FOR EIGHT WEEKS. GUNA (YOGIC PERSONALITY) WAS ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER EIGHT WEEKS USING THE SELF-ADMINISTERED VEDIC PERSONALITY INVENTORY (VPI) WHICH ASSESSES SATTVA (GENTLE AND CONTROLLED), RAJAS (VIOLENT AND UNCONTROLLED) AND TAMAS (DULL AND UNCONTROLLED). THE GENERAL HEALTH STATUS (TOTAL HEALTH), WHICH INCLUDES FOUR DOMAINS NAMELY SOMATIC SYMPTOMS (SS), ANXIETY AND INSOMNIA (AI), SOCIAL DYSFUNCTION (SF) AND SEVERE DEPRESSION (SP), WAS ASSESSED USING A GENERAL HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE (GHQ). RESULTS: BASELINE SCORES FOR ALL THE DOMAINS FOR BOTH THE GROUPS DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY (P > 0.05, INDEPENDENT SAMPLES T TEST). SATTVA SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WITHIN THE GROUPS AND THE EFFECT SIZE WAS MORE IN THE Y THAN IN THE PE GROUP. RAJAS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE WITHIN AND BETWEEN THE GROUPS WITH A HIGHER EFFECT SIZE IN THE PE GROUP. TAMAS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION WITHIN THE PE GROUP ONLY. THE GHQ REVEALED THAT THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN SS, AI, SF AND SP IN BOTH Y AND PE GROUPS (WILCOXCON SINGED RANK T TEST). SS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GROUPS (MANN WHITNEY U TEST). CONCLUSIONS: THERE WAS AN IMPROVEMENT IN SATTVA IN BOTH THE YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS WITH A TREND OF HIGHER EFFECT SIZE IN YOGA; RAJAS REDUCED IN BOTH BUT SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER IN PE THAN IN YOGA AND TAMAS REDUCED IN PE. THE GENERAL HEALTH STATUS IMPROVED IN BOTH THE YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                            
5  703 23 EFFECT OF INTEGRAL YOGA ON PSYCHOLOGICAL AND HEALTH VARIABLES AND THEIR CORRELATIONS. OBJECTIVE: CERTAIN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND HEALTH VARIABLES ARE COMMONLY MEASURED IN INDIA. THIS STUDY EVALUATES THE EFFECTS OF INTEGRAL YOGA PRACTICES ON THESE VARIABLES AND ALSO THE CONSISTENCY OF CORRELATIONS OBSERVED BETWEEN THEM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE STUDY WAS A PRE-POST INTERVENTION STUDY. THE VARIABLES WERE MEASURED AT THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF A ONE-MONTH YOGA COURSE. THERE WAS NO CONTROL GROUP.THE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT AT SWAMI VIVEKANANDA YOGA ANUSANDHANA SAMSTHANA (S-VYASA) UNIVERSITY, IN ITS RURAL CAMPUS SOUTH OF BANGALORE. BASED ON HEALTH CRITERIA, 108 SUBJECTS WERE SELECTED OUT OF 198 VOLUNTEERS TO FORM THE EXPERIMENTAL YOGA GROUP. AGES RANGED FROM 17 TO 63 YEARS. THE YOGASANAS (POSTURES), PRANAYAMA (BREATHING EXERCISES), RELAXATION TECHNIQUES, MEDITATION, CHANTING AND LECTURES WERE THE COMPONENTS OF YOGA INTERVENTION. THE VARIABLES MEASURED WERE SUSTAINED ATTENTION, EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE - EQ, GENERAL HEALTH - GHQ, GUNA PERSONALITY - SATTVA, RAJAS AND TAMAS. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT PRE-POST CHANGES WERE FOUND IN ALL VARIABLES. SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS WERE FOUND BETWEEN THE FOLLOWING PAIRS: THE TWO SUSTAINED ATTENTION VARIABLES; EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND GENERAL HEALTH; GHQ AND TAMAS; SATTVA AND TAMAS; AND RAJAS AND TAMAS. CONCLUSION: THE STUDY SHOWS THAT THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ALL VARIABLES (P< 0.001) EXCEPT IN SATTVA. IT ALSO CONFIRMS THAT EQ AND GENERAL HEALTH VARIABLES CORRELATE SIGNIFICANTLY WITH EACH OTHER AND NEGATIVELY WITH TAMAS. EQ AND TAMAS FORM POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE PREDICTORS OF HEALTH RESPECTIVELY. SATTVA CORRELATES POSITIVELY WITH EQ SUGGESTING THAT A SATTVIC PERSONALITY INDICATES BETTER SELF-CONTROL. THIS SUGGESTS THAT, BY IMPROVING GUNA PERSONALITY, LONG-TERM YOGA PRACTICE MAY STABILIZE EQ.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
6 2400 22 YOGA AND DISC DEGENERATIVE DISEASE IN CERVICAL AND LUMBAR SPINE: AN MR IMAGING-BASED CASE CONTROL STUDY. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE CURRENT STUDY WAS TO FIND OUT WHETHER YOGA PRACTICE WAS BENEFICIAL TO THE SPINE BY COMPARING DEGENERATIVE DISC DISEASE IN THE SPINES OF LONG-TIME YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND NON-YOGA PRACTICING CONTROLS, USING AN OBJECTIVE MEASUREMENT TOOL, MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING. THIS MATCHED CASE-CONTROL STUDY COMPRISED 18 YOGA INSTRUCTORS WITH TEACHING EXPERIENCE OF MORE THAN 10 YEARS AND 18 NON-YOGA PRACTICING ASYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS RANDOMLY SELECTED FROM A HEALTH CHECKUP DATABASE. A VALIDATED GRADING SCALE WAS USED TO GRADE THE CONDITION OF CERVICAL AND LUMBAR DISCS SEEN IN MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING OF THE SPINE, AND THE RESULTING DATA ANALYZED STATISTICALLY. THE MEAN NUMBER OF YEARS OF YOGA PRACTICE FOR THE YOGA GROUP WAS 12.9 +/- 7.5. THE OVERALL (CERVICAL + LUMBAR) DISC SCORES OF THE YOGA GROUP WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER (INDICATING LESS DEGENERATIVE DISC DISEASE) THAN THOSE OF THE CONTROL GROUP (P < 0.001). THE SCORES FOR THE CERVICAL VERTEBRAL DISCS OF THE YOGA GROUP WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THOSE OF THE CONTROL GROUP (P < 0.001), WHILE THE LOWER SCORES FOR THE YOGA GROUP IN THE LUMBAR GROUP APPROACHED, BUT DID NOT REACH, STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE (P = 0.055). THE SCORES FOR INDIVIDUAL DISCS OF YOGA PRACTITIONERS SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEGENERATIVE DISEASE AT THREE DISC LEVELS, C3/C4, L2/L3 AND L3/L4 (P < 0.05). MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING SHOWED THAT THE GROUP OF LONG-TERM PRACTITIONERS OF YOGA STUDIED HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEGENERATIVE DISC DISEASE THAN A MATCHED CONTROL GROUP.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
7 1726 23 PERFORMANCE IN A CORSI BLOCK-TAPPING TASK FOLLOWING HIGH-FREQUENCY YOGA BREATHING OR BREATH AWARENESS. BACKGROUND: UNINOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING PRACTICES HAVE IMPROVED SPATIAL MEMORY SCORES. THERE HAS BEEN NO ASSESSMENT ON THE EFFECT OF HIGH-FREQUENCY YOGA BREATHING (HFYB) ON WORKING MEMORY AND SPATIAL MEMORY SCORES USING THE CORSI BLOCK-TAPPING TASK (CBTT). OBJECTIVES: THE PRESENT STUDY WAS PLANNED TO ASSESS THE IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF HFYB AND BREATH AWARENESS (BAW) COMPARED TO A CONTROL SESSION ON PERFORMANCE IN A CBTT. METHODS: FIFTEEN PARTICIPANTS OF BOTH SEXES WITH AGES BETWEEN 18 AND 24 YEARS (GROUP MEAN AGE +/- STANDARD DEVIATION, 20.0 +/- 1.6 YEARS; 10 FEMALES) WERE RECRUITED FOR THE TRIAL FROM A UNIVERSITY IN NORTH INDIA. EACH PARTICIPANT WAS ASSESSED IN THREE SESSIONS CONDUCTED ON 3 SEPARATE DAYS AT THE SAME TIME OF THE DAY. THE THREE SESSIONS WERE (I) HFYB, (II) BAW, AND (III) QUIET SITTING (QS). THE DURATION OF THE INTERVENTION WAS 18 MIN. THE PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER ALL THE THREE SESSIONS. REPEATED-MEASURES-ANALYSES OF VARIANCE FOLLOWED BY POST HOC TESTS WITH BONFERRONI ADJUSTMENT WERE PERFORMED TO COMPARE DATA BEFORE AND AFTER ALL THE THREE SESSIONS. RESULTS: BAW RESULTED IN AN IMPROVEMENT IN BACKWARD TOTAL SCORES (P < 0.05) AND THE BACKWARD CORSI SPAN (P < 0.05; ONE TAILED). CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT BAW IMPROVES PRIMARY WORKING MEMORY, SPATIAL MEMORY, AND SPATIAL ATTENTION. HFYB DID NOT CAUSE ANY CHANGE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
8  164 23 A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL OF THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON GUNAS (PERSONALITY) AND SELF ESTEEM IN NORMAL HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS. BACKGROUND/AIMS: TO STUDY THE EFFICACY OF YOGA ON GUNAS (PERSONALITY) AND SELF ESTEEM IN NORMAL ADULTS THROUGH A RANDOMIZED COMPARATIVE STUDY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: OF THE 1228 PERSONS WHO ATTENDED MOTIVATIONAL LECTURES, 226 SUBJECTS AGED 18-71 YEARS, OF BOTH SEXES, WHO SATISFIED THE INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA, AND WHO CONSENTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED INTO TWO GROUPS. THE YOGA (Y) GROUP PRACTISED AN INTEGRATED YOGA MODULE THAT INCLUDED ASANAS, PRANAYAMA, MEDITATION, NOTIONAL CORRECTION, AND DEVOTIONAL SESSIONS. THE COMPARISON GROUP PRACTISED MILD TO MODERATE PHYSICAL EXERCISES (PE). BOTH GROUPS HAD SUPERVISED PRACTICES FOR ONE HOUR DAILY, SIX DAYS A WEEK, FOR EIGHT WEEKS. GUNA (PERSONALITY) WAS ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER EIGHT WEEKS USING THE SELF-ADMINISTERED "THE 'GITA" INVENTORY OF PERSONALITY" (GIN) TO ASSESS SATTVA, RAJAS, AND TAMAS. SELF ESTEEM IN TERMS OF COMPETENCY (COM), GLOBAL SELF ESTEEM (GSE), MORAL AND SELF ESTEEM (MSE), SOCIAL ESTEEM (SET), FAMILY SELF ESTEEM (FSE), BODY AND PHYSICAL APPEARANCE (BPA), AND THE LIE SCALE (LIS) WERE ASSESSED USING THE SELF ESTEEM QUESTIONNAIRE (SEQ). RESULTS: THE BASELINE SCORES FOR ALL DOMAINS FOR BOTH THE GROUPS DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY (P > 0.05 INDEPENDENT SAMPLES T-TEST). THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT PRE-POST IMPROVEMENTS IN ALL DOMAINS IN BOTH GROUPS (P < 0.001 PAIRED T-TEST). THE NUMBER OF PERSONS WHO SHOWED IMPROVEMENT IN SATTVA AND DECREASE IN TAMAS WAS SIGNIFICANT IN THE Y BUT NOT IN THE PE GROUP (MCNEMAR TEST). THE EFFECT SIZE FOR SELF ESTEEM IN THE Y GROUP IS GREATER THAN FOR THE PE GROUP IN THREE OUT OF SEVEN DOMAINS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY HAS SHOWN THE INFLUENCE OF YOGA ON GUNAS AND SELF ESTEEM IN COMPARISON TO PHYSICAL EXERCISE.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
9  857 17 EFFECT OF YOGA ON VIGILANCE, SELF RATED SLEEP AND STATE ANXIETY IN BORDER SECURITY FORCE PERSONNEL IN INDIA. BACKGROUND: MILITARY OCCUPATIONS REQUIRE HEIGHTENED VIGILANCE WITH RESULTANT SLEEP DISTURBANCES, INCREASED ANXIETY AND REDUCED VIGILANCE. OBJECTIVE: TO COMPARE YOGA WITH PHYSICAL TRAINING TO REDUCE INSOMNIA, ANXIETY AND INCREASE VIGILANCE IN SECURITY PERSONNEL. METHODS: ONE HUNDRED AND TWELVE BORDER SECURITY FORCE PERSONNEL (BSF GROUP, MALES; MEAN AGE+/-SD = 30.4+/-7.4 YEARS) WERE COMPARED WITH 112 PERSONNEL OF A PRIVATE SECURITY FIRM (SIS GROUP). THE BSF GROUP RECEIVED YOGA FOR NINE DAYS AND THE SIS GROUP RECEIVED PHYSICAL TRAINING FOR THE SAME PERIOD. ASSESSMENTS WERE AT BASELINE AND AFTER 9 DAYS, WITH THE DIGIT VIGILANCE TEST (DVT), SPIELBERGER'S STAI-S, AND A SLEEP RATING QUESTIONNAIRE. RESULTS: (1) BETWEEN GROUPS: (I) AT BASELINE THE BSF GROUP HAD HIGHER VIGILANCE AND MORE DAYTIME NAPS COMPARED TO THE SIS GROUP AND (II) AFTER NINE DAYS THE SIS GROUP HAD HIGHER STATE ANXIETY COMPARED TO THE BSF GROUP (ANOVA, BONFERRONI ADJUSTED POST-HOC COMPARISONS; SPSS VERSION 24.0) (2) IN POST-PRE INTERVENTION COMPARISONS (I) THE BSF GROUP INCREASED VIGILANCE AND DECREASED STATE ANXIETY AFTER YOGA, WITH IMPROVED SLEEP, WHILE (II) THE SIS GROUP SHOWED INCREASED VIGILANCE AFTER PHYSICAL TRAINING. CONCLUSION: YOGA MAY IMPROVE SLEEP, REDUCE ANXIETY WHILE INCREASING VIGILANCE IN OCCUPATIONS REQUIRING VIGILANCE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
10   72 18 A FUNCTIONAL NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY STUDY OF HIGH-FREQUENCY YOGA BREATHING COMPARED TO BREATH AWARENESS. BACKGROUND HIGH-FREQUENCY YOGA BREATHING (BREATH RATE OF 2.0 HZ) HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN OXY-HEMOGLOBIN IN THE PREFRONTAL REGION OF THE BRAIN. THE PRESENT STUDY ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF HIGH-FREQUENCY YOGA BREATHING (HFYB) AT 1.0 HZ ON FRONTAL OXY-HEMOGLOBIN (OXY-HB) AND DEOXY-HEMOGLOBIN (DEOXY-HB). MATERIAL AND METHODS FORTY HEALTHY MALE PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED FOR THE STUDY. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP CONSISTED OF 20 PARTICIPANTS 23-40 YEARS OLD (GROUP MEAN +/-S.D., 26.4+/-4.7 YEARS) WITH AT LEAST 3 MONTHS OF EXPERIENCE PERFORMING HFYB (GROUP MEAN +/-S.D., 16.3+/-9.8 MONTHS). THE CONTROL GROUP CONSISTED OF 20 PARTICIPANTS AGES 23-38 YEARS (GROUP MEAN AGE +/- S.D., 27.4+/-4.1 YEARS), WHO WERE SEATED QUIETLY FOR THE SAME DURATION AND THEIR AVERAGE EXPERIENCE OF YOGA PRACTICE WAS (+/-S.D.) 4.3+/-2.7 MONTHS. EACH PARTICIPANT IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS ASSESSED AT 2 SESSIONS (HFYB AND BREATH AWARENESS [BAW]) ON ALTERNATE DAYS. HEMODYNAMIC CHANGES WERE ASSESSED USING A FUNCTIONAL NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY SENSOR PLACED OVER THE FOREHEAD. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING REPEATED-MEASURES ANALYSES OF VARIANCE FOLLOWED BY POST HOC BONFERRONI ADJUSTMENT. RESULTS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION WAS OBSERVED IN OXY-HB DURING AND AFTER HFYB ON THE LEFT AND RIGHT SIDES COMPARED TO VALUES BEFORE. WE ALSO FOUND A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DEOXY-HB DURING AND AFTER THE QUIET SITTING CONTROL SESSION COMPARED TO PRE-SESSION VALUES ON LEFT AND RIGHT SIDES. CONCLUSIONS THE DECREASE IN OXY-HB DURING AND AFTER HFYB SUGGESTS THAT THERE WAS NO FRONTAL ACTIVATION DURING HFYB WHEN PRACTICED AT THE RATE OF 1.0 HZ.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
11  858 27 EFFECT OF YOGA OR PHYSICAL EXERCISE ON PHYSICAL, COGNITIVE AND EMOTIONAL MEASURES IN CHILDREN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SEPARATELY REPORTED THE EFFECTS OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE AND YOGA IN CHILDREN, SHOWING PHYSICAL, COGNITIVE AND EMOTIONAL BENEFITS. OBJECTIVES: THE PRESENT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA OR PHYSICAL EXERCISE ON PHYSICAL FITNESS, COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE, SELF-ESTEEM, AND TEACHER-RATED BEHAVIOR AND PERFORMANCE, IN SCHOOL CHILDREN. METHODS: 98 SCHOOL CHILDREN BETWEEN 8 TO 13 YEARS WERE RANDOMIZED AS YOGA AND PHYSICAL EXERCISE GROUPS {N = 49 EACH; (YOGA: 15 GIRLS, GROUP MEAN AGE 10.4 +/- 1.2 YEARS), (PHYSICAL EXERCISE: 23 GIRLS, GROUP MEAN AGE 10.5 +/- 1.3 YEARS)}. BOTH GROUPS WERE BLIND ASSESSED AFTER ALLOCATION, USING: (I) THE EUROFIT PHYSICAL FITNESS TEST BATTERY, (II) STROOP COLOR-WORD TASK FOR CHILDREN, (III) BATTLE'S SELF-ESTEEM INVENTORY AND (IV) THE TEACHERS' RATING OF THE CHILDREN'S OBEDIENCE, ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE, ATTENTION, PUNCTUALITY, AND BEHAVIOR WITH FRIENDS AND TEACHERS. AFTER ASSESSMENTS THE YOGA GROUP PRACTICED YOGA (BREATHING TECHNIQUES, POSTURES, GUIDED RELAXATION AND CHANTING), 45 MINUTES EACH DAY, 5 DAYS A WEEK. DURING THIS TIME THE PHYSICAL EXERCISE GROUP HAD JOGGING-IN-PLACE, RAPID REPETITIVE MOVEMENTS AND RELAY RACES OR GAMES. BOTH GROUPS WERE ASSESSED AT THE END OF 3 MONTHS. DATA WERE ANALYZED WITH RM ANOVA AND POST-HOC TESTS WERE BONFERRONI ADJUSTED. RESULTS: THERE WAS ONE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS. THIS WAS IN SOCIAL SELF-ESTEEM WHICH WAS HIGHER AFTER PHYSICAL EXERCISE COMPARED TO YOGA (P < 0.05). ALL THE CHANGES REPORTED BELOW ARE BASED ON AFTER-BEFORE COMPARISONS, WITHIN EACH GROUP. BOTH GROUPS SHOWED AN INCREASE IN BMI, AND NUMBER OF SIT-UPS (P < 0.001). BALANCE WORSENED IN THE PHYSICAL EXERCISE GROUP, WHILE PLATE TAPPING IMPROVED IN THE YOGA GROUP (P < 0.001). IN THE STROOP TASK BOTH GROUPS SHOWED IMPROVED COLOR, WORD- AND COLOR-WORD NAMING (P < 0.01), WHILE THE PHYSICAL EXERCISE GROUP SHOWED HIGHER INTERFERENCE SCORES. TOTAL, GENERAL AND PARENTAL SELF-ESTEEM IMPROVED IN THE YOGA GROUP (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: YOGA AND PHYSICAL EXERCISE ARE USEFUL ADDITIONS TO THE SCHOOL ROUTINE, WITH PHYSICAL EXERCISE IMPROVING SOCIAL SELF-ESTEEM. TRIAL REGISTRATION: THE STUDY WAS REGISTERED IN THE CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRY OF INDIA (CTRI/2012/11/003112).	2013	

12  866 19 EFFECT OF YOGA PROGRAM ON EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS OF ADOLESCENTS DWELLING IN AN ORPHAN HOME: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. EXECUTIVE FUNCTION (EF) IS IMPORTANT FOR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OF CHILDREN. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT CHILDREN WITH POVERTY AND EARLY LIFE STRESS HAVE REDUCED EF. THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA PROGRAM ON THE EF OF ORPHAN ADOLESCENTS. SEVENTY TWO APPARENTLY HEALTHY ORPHAN ADOLESCENTS RANDOMIZED AND ALLOCATED INTO TWO GROUPS AS YOGA GROUP (N = 40; 14 GIRLS, AGE = 12.69 +/- 1.35 YRS) AND WAIT LIST CONTROL (WLC) GROUP (N = 32, 13 GIRLS, AGE = 12.58 +/- 1.52 YRS). YOGA GROUP UNDERWENT THREE MONTHS OF YOGA PROGRAM IN A SCHEDULE OF 90 MIN PER DAY, FOUR DAYS PER WEEK WHEREAS THE WLC GROUP FOLLOWED THE ROUTINE ACTIVITIES. THEY WERE ASSESSED BY STROOP COLOR-WORD TASK, DIGIT SYMBOL SUBSTITUTION TEST (DSST), DIGITS SPAN TEST AND TRIAL MAKING TEST (TMT) AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE PROGRAM. THE REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN TIME AND GROUP INTERACTIONS (P < 0.05) FOR ALL SUBTESTS OF STROOP COLOR-WORD TASK AND DIGIT SPAN TEST AND PART-A OF TMT WHEREAS THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE FOUND IN DSST AND TMT (PART-B). THE POST-HOC TEST WITH BONFERRONI ADJUSTMENT ALSO SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS (P < 0.001) WITHIN THE YOGA GROUP IN ALL TEST SCORES WHILE IN WRONG SCORE OF DSST DID NOT EXHIBIT SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION. WHEREAS THE WLC GROUP, SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT (P < 0.05) IN STROOP COLOR, COLOR-WORD SCORE, NET SCORE OF DSST, DIGIT SPAN FORWARD AND DIGIT SPAN TOTAL. THREE MONTHS YOGA PROGRAM WAS FOUND USEFUL FOR THE YOUNG ORPHAN ADOLESCENTS IN IMPROVING THEIR EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
13  462 23 CHANGES IN REACTION TIME AFTER YOGA BELLOWS-TYPE BREATHING IN HEALTHY FEMALE VOLUNTEERS. BACKGROUND: PREVIOUSLY, YOGA BELLOWS-TYPE BREATHING (BHASTRIKA PRANAYAMA) REDUCED REACTION TIME (RT) OR REDUCED ANTICIPATORY RESPONSES IN MALE PARTICIPANTS OR A MIXED GROUP OF MALE AND FEMALE PARTICIPANTS. AIMS: THE PRESENT STUDY AS A CONTROL TRIAL AIMED TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA BELLOWS-TYPE BREATHING ON RT IN FEMALES EXCLUSIVELY. METHODS: THE SAMPLE CONSISTED OF 25 HEALTHY FEMALES, AGED BETWEEN 19 AND 32 YEARS (GROUP MEAN +/- STANDARD DEVIATION, 22.8 +/- 3.5 YEARS). ALL OF THEM HAD PRIOR MINIMUM EXPERIENCE OF YOGA INCLUDING YOGA BELLOWS-TYPE BREATHING OF 12 MONTHS. THE RT WAS ASSESSED IN EACH PARTICIPANT BEFORE AND AFTER THREE RANDOMIZED SESSIONS DIFFERED IN THE INTERVENTION GIVEN HELD ON THREE SEPARATE DAYS. THE SESSIONS WERE (I) YOGA BELLOWS-TYPE BREATHING OR BHASTRIKA PRANAYAMA(BHK), (II) BREATH AWARENESS (BAW), AND (III) SITTING QUIETLY (CTL) AS A CONTROL SESSION. THE DURATION OF THE INTERVENTION WAS 18 MIN, AND THE PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSESSED FOR RT BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION. RESULTS: REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA, POST HOC TESTS WITH BONFERRONI ADJUSTED SHOWED THAT THE TIME TAKEN TO OBTAIN A CORRECT RESPONSE REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER 18 MIN OF BAW (P < 0.05) AND CTL (P < 0.05). HOWEVER, NO CHANGES WERE SEEN IN THE RT AFTER BHK. CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT DIFFERENT INTERVENTIONS MAY OPTIMIZE PERFORMANCE IN TASKS REQUIRING ATTENTION IN FEMALES COMPARED TO MALES.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
14  463 24 CHANGES IN SHAPE AND SIZE DISCRIMINATION AND STATE ANXIETY AFTER ALTERNATE-NOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING AND BREATH AWARENESS IN ONE SESSION EACH. BACKGROUND YOGA BREATHING TECHNIQUES LIKE HIGH-FREQUENCY YOGA BREATHING (HFYB) AND BREATH AWARENESS (BAW) HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED PERFORMANCE IN THE SHAPE AND SIZE DISCRIMINATION TASK. A PUBMED SEARCH OF THE LITERATURE REVEALED THAT ALTERNATE-NOSTRIL BREATHING HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE IN ATTENTION TASKS, BUT THE EFFECT ON TACTILE PERCEPTION HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED. HENCE, THE PRESENT STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO ASSESS THE IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF ALTERNATE-NOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING (ANYB) COMPARED TO BREATH AWARENESS ON SHAPE AND SIZE DISCRIMINATION AND STATE ANXIETY. MATERIAL AND METHODS FIFTY HEALTHY MALE VOLUNTEERS AGES 20-50 YEARS (GROUP MEAN +/-S.D., 28.4+/-8.2 YEARS) WERE RECRUITED. EACH PARTICIPANT WAS ASSESSED IN 3 SESSIONS CONDUCTED ON 3 SEPARATE DAYS AT THE SAME TIME OF DAY. THE 3 SESSIONS WERE (I) ALTERNATE-NOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING (ANYB), (II) BREATH AWARENESS (BAW), AND (III) QUIET SITTING (QS), AND THE SEQUENCE OF THE SESSIONS WAS RANDOMLY ALLOCATED. THE SHAPE AND SIZE DISCRIMINATION TASK AND STATE ANXIETY WERE ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER ALL 3 SESSIONS. REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (RM-ANOVA) FOLLOWED BY POST HOC TESTS FOR MULTIPLE COMPARISONS, WHICH WERE BONFERRONI-ADJUSTED, WERE PERFORMED TO COMPARE DATA BEFORE AND AFTER ALL 3 SESSIONS USING SPSS VERSION 18.0. RESULTS THE ERRORS SCORES IN THE SHAPE AND SIZE DISCRIMINATION TASK SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION AFTER THE ANYB SESSION (P<0.001). A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION WAS FOUND IN THE LEVEL OF STATE ANXIETY AFTER BREATH AWARENESS (P<0.05) AND QUIET SITTING SESSIONS (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS THE PRESENT RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ANYB: (I) IMPROVES PERFORMANCE IN A TASK WHICH REQUIRES PERCEPTUAL SENSITIVITY AND FOCUSED ATTENTION, BUT (II) DOES NOT REDUCE STATE ANXIETY FOLLOWING THIS TASK.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
15  442 19 CEREBROVASCULAR DYNAMICS ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA BREATHING AND BREATH AWARENESS. AIMS: BREATH FREQUENCY CAN ALTER CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW. THE STUDY AIMED TO DETERMINE BILATERAL MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERIAL HEMODYNAMICS IN HIGH-FREQUENCY YOGA BREATHING (HFYB) AND SLOW FREQUENCY ALTERNATE NOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING (ANYB) USING TRANSCRANIAL DOPPLER SONOGRAPHY. METHODS: HEALTHY MALE VOLUNTEERS WERE ASSESSED IN TWO SEPARATE TRIALS BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER HFYB (2.0 HZ FOR 1 MIN, N = 16) AND ANYB (12 BREATHS PER MINUTE FOR 5 MIN, N = 22). HFYB AND ANYB WERE SEPARATELY COMPARED TO BREATH AWARENESS (BAW) AND TO CONTROL SESSIONS. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: THE DATA WERE ANALYZED USING REPEATED-MEASURES ANOVA WITH BONFERRONI ADJUSTED POST HOC TESTS. RESULTS: DURING HFYB THERE WAS A DECREASE IN END-DIASTOLIC VELOCITY (EDV) AND MEAN FLOW VELOCITY (MFV) (P < 0.01 FOR LEFT AND P < 0.05 FOR RIGHT MIDDLE CEREBRAL ARTERIES; MCA) WITH AN INCREASE IN PULSATILITY INDEX (PI) FOR THE RIGHT MCA (P < 0.05). DURING ANYB, THERE WAS A BILATERAL DECREASE IN PEAK SYSTOLIC VELOCITY (P < 0.05 FOR LEFT AND P < 0.01 FOR RIGHT MCA), EDV (P < 0.01) AND MFV (P < 0.01 FOR LEFT AND P < 0.001 FOR RIGHT MCA) AND AN INCREASE IN PI (P < 0.01). DURING BAW OF THE TWO SESSIONS THERE WAS A DECREASE IN LATERALIZED FLOW AND END-DIASTOLIC VELOCITIES (P < 0.05) AND AN INCREASE IN PI (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: CHANGES IN PEAK FLOW VELOCITIES AND PULSATILITY INDICES DURING AND AFTER HFYB, ANYB, AND BAW SUGGEST DECREASED CEREBROVASCULAR BLOOD FLOW AND INCREASED FLOW RESISTANCE BASED ON DIFFERENT MECHANISMS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
16 1317 24 HEART RATE VARIABILITY CHANGES DURING HIGH FREQUENCY YOGA BREATHING AND BREATH AWARENESS. BACKGROUND: PRE AND POST COMPARISON AFTER ONE MINUTE OF HIGH FREQUENCY YOGA BREATHING (HFYB) SUGGESTED THAT THE HFYB MODIFIES THE AUTONOMIC STATUS BY INCREASING SYMPATHETIC MODULATION, BUT ITS EFFECT DURING THE PRACTICE WAS NOT ASSESSED. METHODS: THIRTY-EIGHT MALE VOLUNTEERS WITH GROUP AVERAGE AGE +/- S.D., 23.3 +/- 4.4 YEARS WERE EACH ASSESSED ON TWO SEPARATE DAYS IN TWO SESSIONS, (I) HFYB AND (II) BREATH AWARENESS. EACH SESSION WAS FOR 35 MINUTES, WITH 3 PERIODS, I.E., PRE (5 MINUTES), DURING HFYB OR BREATH AWARENESS (15 MINUTES) AND POST (5 MINUTES). RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN NN50, PNN50 AND THE MEAN RR INTERVAL DURING AND AFTER HFYB AND AFTER BREATH AWARENESS, COMPARED TO THE RESPECTIVE 'PRE' VALUES (P < 0.05) (REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA FOLLOWED BY POST-HOC ANALYSIS). THE LF POWER INCREASED AND HF POWER DECREASED DURING AND AFTER BREATH AWARENESS AND LF/HF RATIO INCREASED AFTER BREATH AWARENESS (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THERE WAS REDUCED PARASYMPATHETIC MODULATION DURING AND AFTER HFYB AND INCREASED SYMPATHETIC MODULATION WITH REDUCED PARASYMPATHETIC MODULATION DURING AND AFTER BREATH AWARENESS.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
17 1111 27 EFFECTS OF YOGASANAS ON OSTEOPOROSIS IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. BACKGROUND: OSTEOPOROSIS IS COMMONLY ENCOUNTERED BY POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. THERE IS AN INCREASED NEED FOR A LOW COST AND EFFICIENT TREATMENT ALTERNATIVE TO ADDRESS THIS POPULATION. AIMS: TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF INTEGRATED YOGA ON BONE MINERAL DENSITY (BMD) IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WITH OSTEOPOROSIS.

18  847 25 EFFECT OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE OF CLBP PATIENTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROL STUDY. CONTEXT: IN TWO OF THE EARLIER RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS ON YOGA FOR CHRONIC LOWER BACK PAIN (CLBP), 12 TO 16 WEEKS OF INTERVENTION WERE FOUND EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING PAIN AND DISABILITY. AIM: TO STUDY THE EFFICACY OF A RESIDENTIAL SHORT TERM INTENSIVE YOGA PROGRAM ON QUALITY OF LIFE IN CLBP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ABOUT 80 PATIENTS WITH CLBP (FEMALES 37) REGISTERED FOR A WEEK LONG TREATMENT AT SVYASA HOLISTIC HEALTH CENTRE IN BENGALURU, INDIA. THEY WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS (40 EACH). THE YOGA GROUP PRACTICED A SPECIFIC MODULE FOR CLBP COMPRISING OF ASANAS (PHYSICAL POSTURES), PRANAYAMA (BREATHING PRACTICES), MEDITATION AND LECTURES ON YOGA PHILOSOPHY. THE CONTROL GROUP PRACTICED PHYSICAL THERAPY EXERCISES FOR BACK PAIN. PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE (PSS) WAS USED TO MEASURE BASELINE STRESS LEVELS. OUTCOME MEASURES WERE WHOQOL BREF FOR QUALITY OF LIFE AND STRAIGHT LEG RAISING TEST (SLR) USING A GONIOMETER. RESULTS: THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE CORRELATIONS (PEARSON'S, P<0.005, R>0.30) BETWEEN BASELINE PSS WITH ALL FOUR DOMAINS AND THE TOTAL SCORE OF WHOQOLBREF. ALL THE FOUR DOMAINS' WHOQOLBREF IMPROVED IN THE YOGA GROUP (REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA P=0.001) WITH SIGNIFICANT GROUP*TIME INTERACTION (P<0.05) AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS (P<0.01). SLR INCREASED IN BOTH GROUPS (P=0.001) WITH HIGHER INCREASE IN YOGA (31.1 % RIGHT, 28.4 % LEFT) THAN CONTROL (18.7% RIGHT, 21.5 % LEFT) GROUP WITH SIGNIFICANT GROUP*TIME INTERACTION (SLR RIGHT LEG P=0.044). CONCLUSION: IN CLBP, A NEGATIVE CORRELATION EXISTS BETWEEN STRESS AND QUALITY OF LIFE. YOGA INCREASES QUALITY OF LIFE AND SPINAL FLEXIBILITY BETTER THAN PHYSICAL THERAPY EXERCISES.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
19  298 19 ALTERNATE-NOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING REDUCED BLOOD PRESSURE WHILE INCREASING PERFORMANCE IN A VIGILANCE TEST. BACKGROUND REPORTS SUGGEST THAT VIGILANCE OR SUSTAINED ATTENTION INCREASES SYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY. A PERSISTENT INCREASE IN SYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY CAN LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN BLOOD PRESSURE. ALTERNATE-NOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE USEFUL TO (I) IMPROVE ATTENTION AND (II) DECREASE THE SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE. EARLIER STUDIES DID NOT REPORT SIMULTANEOUS RECORDINGS OF THE BLOOD PRESSURE AND PERFORMANCE IN VIGILANCE TESTS AFTER ALTERNATE-NOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING. WITH THIS BACKGROUND, THE PRESENT STUDY WAS PLANNED TO DETERMINE IF 15 MINUTES OF ALTERNATE NOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING COULD IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE IN A VIGILANCE TEST WITHOUT AN INCREASE IN BLOOD PRESSURE. MATERIAL AND METHODS FIFTEEN HEALTHY MALE VOLUNTEERS PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY (GROUP MEAN AGE +/-SD, 22.4+/-2.4 YEARS). PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSESSED ON 3 SEPARATE DAYS IN 3 DIFFERENT SESSIONS. THESE WERE (I) ALTERNATE NOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING, (II) BREATH AWARENESS, AND (III) SITTING QUIETLY AS A CONTROL. BLOOD PRESSURE AND THE DIGIT VIGILANCE TEST WERE SIMULTANEOUSLY ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER EACH SESSION. RESULTS SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (P<0.01), MEAN ARTERIAL BLOOD PRESSURE (P<0.05), AND THE TIME TAKEN TO COMPLETE THE DIGIT VIGILANCE TEST (P<0.05) SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED FOLLOWING ALTERNATE-NOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING. THE TIME TAKEN TO COMPLETE THE DIGIT VIGILANCE TEST DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN SESSIONS (P<0.05). THE TIME TAKEN TO COMPLETE THE DIGIT VIGILANCE TEST WAS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED AFTER SITTING QUIETLY (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS ALTERNATE-NOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING APPEARS TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE IN THE DIGIT VIGILANCE TEST, ALONG WITH A REDUCTION IN SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE. THIS IS SUGGESTIVE OF BETTER VIGILANCE WITHOUT SYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
20  768 22 EFFECT OF TWO YOGA-BASED RELAXATION TECHNIQUES ON MEMORY SCORES AND STATE ANXIETY. BACKGROUND: A YOGA PRACTICE INVOLVING CYCLES OF YOGA POSTURES AND SUPINE REST (CALLED CYCLIC MEDITATION) WAS PREVIOUSLY SHOWN TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE IN ATTENTION TASKS MORE THAN RELAXATION IN THE CORPSE POSTURE (SHAVASANA). THIS WAS ASCRIBED TO REDUCED ANXIETY, THOUGH THIS WAS NOT ASSESSED. METHODS: IN FIFTY-SEVEN MALE VOLUNTEERS (GROUP AVERAGE AGE +/- S.D., 26.6 +/- 4.5 YEARS) THE IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF TWO YOGA RELAXATION TECHNIQUES WAS STUDIED ON MEMORY AND STATE ANXIETY. ALL PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER (I) CYCLIC MEDITATION (CM) PRACTICED FOR 22:30 MINUTES ON ONE DAY AND (II) AN EQUAL DURATION OF SUPINE REST (SR) OR THE CORPSE POSTURE (SHAVASANA), ON ANOTHER DAY. SECTIONS OF THE WECHSLER MEMORY SCALE (WMS) WERE USED TO ASSESS; (I) ATTENTION AND CONCENTRATION (DIGIT SPAN FORWARD AND BACKWARD), AND (II) ASSOCIATE LEARNING. STATE ANXIETY WAS ASSESSED USING SPIELBERGER'S STATE-TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY (STAI). RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE SCORES OF ALL SECTIONS OF THE WMS STUDIED AFTER BOTH CM AND SR, BUT, THE MAGNITUDE OF CHANGE WAS MORE AFTER CM COMPARED TO AFTER SR. THE STATE ANXIETY SCORES DECREASED AFTER BOTH CM AND SR, WITH A GREATER MAGNITUDE OF DECREASE AFTER CM. THERE WAS NO CORRELATION BETWEEN PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN MEMORY SCORES AND STATE ANXIETY FOR EITHER SESSION. CONCLUSION: A CYCLICAL COMBINATION OF YOGA POSTURES AND SUPINE REST IN CM IMPROVED MEMORY SCORES IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE PRACTICE AND DECREASED STATE ANXIETY MORE THAN REST IN A CLASSICAL YOGA RELAXATION POSTURE (SHAVASANA).	2009

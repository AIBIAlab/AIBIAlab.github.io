1 1409 165 IMPACT OF YOGA ON PERIODONTAL DISEASE AND STRESS MANAGEMENT. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT, EFFECTIVE, AND VALUABLE TOOLS AVAILABLE FOR MAN TO OVERCOME VARIOUS PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS. STRESS CONTRIBUTES SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE PATHOGENESIS OF PERIODONTAL DISEASES; HENCE, IT BECOMES IMPORTANT TO REDUCE THE LEVEL OF STRESS FOR PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF DISEASES. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: THE PRESENT STUDY WAS AIMED: (1) TO UNDERSTAND AND ANALYZE THE POSSIBILITIES OF EMPLOYING YOGIC PRACTICES IN THE TREATMENT OF PERIODONTAL DISEASE ALONG WITH CONVENTIONAL DENTAL THERAPY, (2) TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECT OF STRESS ON PERIODONTAL TREATMENT OUTCOME, (3) TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PERIODONTAL DISEASE WITH REFERENCE TO STRESS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AN OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENT-BASED PARALLEL GROUP RANDOMIZED STUDY WAS PERFORMED WITH STANDARD TREATMENT FOR PERIODONTAL DISEASE YOGA THERAPY AS GROUP II AND ONLY STANDARD TREATMENT AS GROUP I. PERIODONTAL HEALTH STATUS WAS RECORDED USING INDICES OF MODIFIED PLAQUE INDEX (PI), BLEEDING ON PROBING (BOP), PROBING DEPTH, AND CLINICAL ATTACHMENT LOSS (CAL). THE COHEN'S PERCEIVED STRESS QUESTIONNAIRE WAS ALSO USED TO DETERMINE STRESS SEVERITY. THE YOGIC INTERVENTION CONSISTS OF LECTURES AND PRACTICAL SESSIONS ON ASANAS, PRANAYAMA, KRIYAS, AND MEDITATION. RESULTS: REPEATED MEASURE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE (P < 0.001) IN ALL THE OUTCOME VARIABLES WITH RESPECT TO TIME IN BOTH GROUPS. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT MEAN PI SCORE REDUCED BY 1.35 IN GROUP II AS COMPARED TO 0.54 IN GROUP I, MEAN PROBING POCKET DEPTH REDUCED BY 1.60 IN GROUP II AS COMPARED TO ONLY 0.68 IN GROUP I, AND MEAN CAL SCORE REDUCED BY 1.60 IN GROUP II AS COMPARED TO 0.68 IN GROUP I. SIMILARLY, COHEN'S PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE SCORE ALSO REDUCED BY 18.76 POINTS IN GROUP II AS COMPARED TO ONLY 2.58 POINTS IN GROUP I, BOP ALSO SHOWS BETTER IMPROVEMENT IN GROUP II WITH A REDUCTION OF 0.68 AS COMPARED TO REDUCTION OF ONLY 0.08 IN GROUP I. THE RESULTS OBTAINED ASCERTAINED THE ROLE OF YOGA IN STRESS REDUCTION IN PERIODONTAL DISEASE. CONCLUSION: ALTHOUGH YOGA DOES NOT PLAY A DIRECT ROLE IN IMPROVING PERIODONTAL DISEASE, IT ACCELERATES THE TREATMENT OUTCOMES BY COMBATING THE STRESS WHICH IS A MAJOR FACTOR AFFECTING THE TREATMENT OF PERIODONTAL DISEASE.	2017	

2  360  55 ASSOCIATION OF YOGA PRACTICE AND SERUM CORTISOL LEVELS IN CHRONIC PERIODONTITIS PATIENTS WITH STRESS-RELATED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. AIM: REDUCING THE PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS BY VARIOUS METHODS CAN IMPROVE OVERALL HEALTH, AND YOGA IS NOW CONSIDERED AS AN EASILY AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVE METHOD. THE PRESENT CROSS-SECTIONAL PILOT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED MAINLY TO FIND THE ASSOCIATION OF YOGA PRACTICE WITH PERIODONTAL DISEASE BY MEASURING SERUM CORTISOL LEVELS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 70 SUBJECTS WITH AGE RANGE OF 35-60 YEARS SUFFERING WITH CHRONIC PERIODONTITIS WERE DIVIDED INTO GROUP I (WITH STRESS), GROUP II (WITHOUT STRESS), AND GROUP III (PRACTICING YOGA). PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION WAS CARRIED OUT USING HAMILTON ANXIETY RATING SCALE (HAM-A) AND ZUNG SELF-RATING DEPRESSION SCALE (ZSDS). PERIODONTAL PARAMETERS LIKE PLAQUE INDEX (PI), PROBING POCKET DEPTH (PPD), AND CLINICAL ATTACHMENT LEVEL (CAL) AT 5-8 MM AND >8 MM WERE RECORDED. BLOOD SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED AND SERUM CORTISOL LEVELS WERE MEASURED. RESULTS: MEAN AGE, PLAQUE SCORES, AND NUMBER OF TEETH WITH PPD AND CAL AT 5-8 MM AND >8 MM WERE SIMILAR IN ALL THE GROUPS, EXCEPT BETWEEN GROUP I AND GROUP III WHERE A MULTIPLE COMPARISON WITH TUKEY'S POST-HOC TEST SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN PLAQUE INDEX (P < 0.038) AND THE NUMBER OF TEETH WITH CAL 5-8 MM (P < 0.016). SERUM CORTISOL LEVELS AND HAM-A SCALE AND ZSDS SCORES SHOWED HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT VALUE (P < 0.001) IN GROUP I SUBJECTS WHEN COMPARED WITH GROUP II AND GROUP III SUBJECTS. CONCLUSION: CROSS-SECTIONAL OBSERVATION DONE AMONG THREE GROUPS SHOWED THAT INDIVIDUALS PRACTICING YOGA REGULARLY HAD LOW SERUM CORTISOL LEVELS, HAM-A SCALE AND ZSDS SCORES, AND BETTER PERIODONTAL HEALTH.	2016

6 1076  38 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PHYSIOLOGICAL INDICES, ANXIETY AND SOCIAL FUNCTIONING IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PATIENTS: A RANDOMIZED TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) AS A CHRONIC DISEASE COULD AFFECT PATIENTS' VARIOUS DOMAINS OF LIFE. AIM: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL INDICES, ANXIETY AND SOCIAL FUNCTIONING OF PATIENTS WITH MS IN SOUTHWEST, IRAN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IN THIS CLINICAL TRIAL STUDY, 60 MS PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED ACCORDING TO INCLUSION CRITERIA AND RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO TWO GROUPS OF 30 EACH. PRIOR TO AND AFTER INTERVENTION, THE PATIENTS' VITAL SIGNS WERE MEASURED. FOR CASE GROUP YOGA EXERCISES WERE PERFORMED THREE SESSIONS A WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS WHILE CONTROL GROUP PERFORMED NO EXERCISE. THE DATA WERE GATHERED BY QUESTIONNAIRE AND ANALYSED BY DESCRIPTIVE AND ANALYTICAL STATISTICS IN SPSS. RESULTS: PRIOR TO INTERVENTION, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN FATIGUE SEVERITY AND PAIN BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS BUT THE MEAN FATIGUE SEVERITY AND PAIN IN CASE GROUP DECREASED COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP AFTER THE INTERVENTION. PRIOR TO INTERVENTION, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN MEAN PHYSIOLOGICAL INDICES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS BUT THE MEAN PHYSIOLOGICAL INDICES IN CASE GROUP DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER THE INTERVENTION (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: YOGA IS LIKELY TO INCREASE SELF-EFFICACY OF MS PATIENTS THROUGH ENHANCING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, INCREASING THE STRENGTH OF LOWER LIMBS AND BALANCE, AND DECREASING FATIGUE AND PAIN, AND FINALLY TO PROMOTE SOCIAL FUNCTIONING AND TO RELIEVE STRESS AND ANXIETY IN THESE PATIENTS.	2016

RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE STRESS SCORES AND THE SELF CONFIDENCE SCORES IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP. THERE WERE NEITHER ANY SIDE EFFECTS NOR ANY DROP OUTS. CONCLUSION: WE CONCLUDE THAT YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OPTION FOR THE PATIENTS WITH INSOMNIA. THERE ARE NO MAJOR SIDE EFFECTS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
8 1846  33 QUALITY OF LIFE AND MENTAL HEALTH IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC DISEASES WHO REGULARLY PRACTICE YOGA AND THOSE WHO DO NOT: A CASE-CONTROL STUDY. WHILE CLINICAL TRIALS HAVE SHOWN EVIDENCE OF EFFICACY OF YOGA IN DIFFERENT CHRONIC DISEASES, SUBJECTIVE HEALTH BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA PRACTICE UNDER NATURALISTIC CONDITIONS HAVE NOT YET BEEN INVESTIGATED. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE ASSOCIATIONS OF REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE WITH QUALITY OF LIFE AND MENTAL HEALTH IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC DISEASES. USING A CASE-CONTROL DESIGN, PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC DISEASES WHO REGULARLY PRACTICED YOGA WERE SELECTED FROM A LARGE OBSERVATIONAL STUDY AND COMPARED TO CONTROLS WHO DID NOT REGULARLY PRACTICE YOGA AND WHO WERE MATCHED INDIVIDUALLY TO EACH CASE ON GENDER, MAIN DIAGNOSIS, EDUCATION, AND AGE (WITHIN 5 YEARS). PATIENTS' QUALITY OF LIFE (SF-36 QUESTIONNAIRE), MENTAL HEALTH (HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE), LIFE SATISFACTION, AND HEALTH SATISFACTION (QUESTIONNAIRE FOR LIFE SATISFACTION) WERE ASSESSED. PATIENTS WHO REGULARLY PRACTICED YOGA (N = 186) HAD A BETTER GENERAL HEALTH STATUS (P = 0.012), A HIGHER PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING (P = 0.001), AND PHYSICAL COMPONENT SCORE (P = 0.029) ON THE SF-36 THAN THOSE WHO DID NOT (N = 186). NO GROUP DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND FOR THE MENTAL SCALES OF THE SF-36, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, LIFE SATISFACTION, OR HEALTH SATISFACTION. IN CONCLUSION, PRACTICING YOGA UNDER NATURALISTIC CONDITIONS SEEMS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED PHYSICAL HEALTH BUT NOT MENTAL HEALTH IN CHRONICALLY DISEASED PATIENTS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
9 2235  39 THE IMPACT OF YOGA UPON FEMALE PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM HYPOTHYROIDISM. OBJECTIVE: TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF FEMALE HYPOTHYROID PATIENTS. DESIGN: THE WHO QUALITY OF LIFE SCALE(22) WAS USED TO ASSESS THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF 20 FEMALE HYPOTHYROID PATIENTS. SUBJECTS ATTENDED ONE HOUR YOGA SESSIONS DAILY FOR A PERIOD OF ONE MONTH. A PRETEST-POST-TEST RESEARCH DESIGN WAS USED FOR DATA ANALYSIS. RESULTS: PATIENTS' QUALITY OF LIFE SCORES FOLLOWING THE YOGA PROGRAM WERE GREATER THAN SCORES OBTAINED PRIOR TO UNDERTAKING YOGA (P < 0.01). PATIENTS ALSO REPORTED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR PERCEPTION OF THE OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE AND OF THEIR HEALTH POST YOGA INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT YOGA IS VALUABLE IN HELPING THE HYPOTHYROID PATIENTS TO MANAGE THEIR DISEASE-RELATED SYMPTOMS. YOGA MAY BE CONSIDERED AS SUPPORTIVE OR COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY IN CONJUNCTION WITH MEDICAL THERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF HYPOTHYROID DISORDER.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
10  784  36 EFFECT OF YOGA BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION ON SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING. YOGA IS ASSUMING IMPORTANCE IN IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE TREATMENT OF A NUMBER OF PSYCHIATRIC AND PSYCHOSOMATIC DISORDERS. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS A PROSPECTIVE CONTROLLED STUDY TO EXPLORE THE SHORT-TERM IMPACT OF A COMPREHENSIVE BUT BRIEF LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION, BASED ON YOGA, ON SUBJECTIVE WELL BEING LEVELS IN NORMAL AND DISEASED SUBJECTS. NORMAL HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS AND SUBJECTS HAVING HYPERTENSION, CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE, DIABETES MELLITUS OR A VARIETY OF OTHER ILLNESSES WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. THE OUTCOME MEASURES WERE 'SUBJECTIVE WELL BEING INVENTORY' (SUBI) SCORES, TAKEN ON THE FIRST AND LAST DAY OF THE COURSE. THE INVENTORY CONSISTS OF QUESTIONS RELATED TO ONE'S FEELINGS AND ATTITUDE ABOUT VARIOUS AREAS OF LIFE, SUCH AS HAPPINESS, ACHIEVEMENT AND INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIP. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE SUBJECTIVE WELL BEING SCORES OF THE 77 SUBJECTS WITHIN A PERIOD OF 10 DAYS AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS. THESE OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT A SHORT LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AND STRESS MANAGEMENT EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM LEADS TO REMARKABLE IMPROVEMENT IN THE SUBJECTIVE WELL BEING SCORES OF THE SUBJECTS AND CAN THEREFORE MAKE AN APPRECIABLE CONTRIBUTION TO PRIMARY PREVENTION AS WELL AS MANAGEMENT OF LIFESTYLE DISEASES.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
11  795  51 EFFECT OF YOGA INTERVENTION IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION: A PREVENTIVE TRIAL. BACKGROUND: NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES ARE ON THE RISE IN INDIA. HYPERTENSION IS ONE OF THE MAJOR RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES AND ALSO LABELED AS A CHRONIC LIFESTYLE DISORDER. HENCE, NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS LEADING TO LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS ARE OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO CONTROL AND PREVENT HYPERTENSION. THIS TRIAL AIMS TO IMPLEMENT YOGA INTERVENTION TO THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP IN ADDITION TO MEDICINES, ADVICE ON DIET AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND TO COMPARE BLOOD PRESSURE AND PERCEIVED STRESS SCORES WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. METHODS: IT WAS AN OPEN-LABEL, TWO-ARMED, NON-RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, CONDUCTED AT A TERTIARY CARE CENTER ON 145 PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION: 73 IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP AND 72 IN THE CONTROL GROUP. THE INTERVENTION GROUP RECEIVED YOGA INTERVENTION FOR A PERIOD OF 4 MONTHS ON A WEEKLY BASIS ALONG WITH ADVICE ON PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, DIET, AND ROUTINE MEDICINES. THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT RECEIVE YOGA INTERVENTION. RESULTS: THE MEAN AGE OF THE PARTICIPANTS WAS 51.3 +/- 9.4, FEMALES (58.2%) OUTNUMBERED MALES (41.3%). FOLLOWING THE INTERVENTION, PERCEIVED STRESS SCORE AND BLOOD PRESSURE SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION BETWEEN TWO GROUPS (P < 0.001). ALSO, PERCEIVED STRESS AND BLOOD PRESSURE WERE FOUND TO BE REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY WITHIN BOTH GROUPS (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: YOGA PROVES TO BE AN EFFECTIVE, SAFE, AND LESS EXPENSIVE ADJUNCT THERAPY FOR HYPERTENSION MANAGEMENT. YOGA WAS ALSO FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE LEVEL OF STRESS. DIET MODIFICATION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY HAVE GOT AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN THE CONTROL AND PREVENTION OF HYPERTENSION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
12  159  36 A RANDOMISED COMPARATIVE TRIAL OF YOGA AND RELAXATION TO REDUCE STRESS AND ANXIETY. OBJECTIVE: TO COMPARE YOGA AND RELAXATION AS TREATMENT MODALITIES AT 10 AND 16 WEEKS FROM STUDY BASELINE TO DETERMINE IF EITHER OF MODALITY REDUCES SUBJECT STRESS, ANXIETY, BLOOD PRESSURE AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE. DESIGN: A RANDOMISED COMPARATIVE TRIAL WAS UNDERTAKEN COMPARING YOGA WITH RELAXATION. PARTICIPANTS: ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-ONE SUBJECTS WITH MILD TO MODERATE LEVELS OF STRESS WERE RECRUITED FROM THE COMMUNITY IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA. INTERVENTIONS: TEN WEEKLY 1- H SESSIONS OF RELAXATION OR HATHA YOGA. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CHANGES IN THE STATE TRAIT PERSONALITY INVENTORY SUB-SCALE ANXIETY, GENERAL HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE AND THE SHORT FORM-36. RESULTS: FOLLOWING THE 10 WEEK INTERVENTION STRESS, ANXIETY AND QUALITY OF LIFE SCORES IMPROVED OVER TIME. YOGA WAS FOUND TO BE AS EFFECTIVE AS RELAXATION IN REDUCING STRESS, ANXIETY AND IMPROVING HEALTH STATUS ON SEVEN DOMAINS OF THE SF-36. YOGA WAS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN RELAXATION IN IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH. AT THE END OF THE 6 WEEK FOLLOW-UP PERIOD THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS IN LEVELS OF STRESS, ANXIETY AND ON FIVE DOMAINS OF THE SF-36. VITALITY, SOCIAL FUNCTION AND MENTAL HEALTH SCORES ON THE SF-36 WERE HIGHER IN THE RELAXATION GROUP DURING THE FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. CONCLUSION: YOGA APPEARS TO PROVIDE A COMPARABLE IMPROVEMENT IN STRESS, ANXIETY AND HEALTH STATUS COMPARED TO RELAXATION.	2007

OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON I) ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING AND II) QOL AMONG INDIVIDUALS WITH AN HIV POSITIVE STATUS. METHODOLOGY: SIXTY INDIVIDUALS WITH HIV-POSITIVE (AGED 30-50 YEARS) FROM REHABILITATION CENTRES ACROSS BANGALORE WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO THE YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP (N=30; 11 MEN) OR THE WAIT-LISTED CONTROL GROUP (N=30; 10 MEN). PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP UNDERWENT 8 WEEKS OF INTENSE YOGA PRACTICE PERFORMED AN HOUR A DAY FOR 5 DAYS A WEEK. THE YOGA PRACTICE CONSISTED OF PHYSICAL POSTURES, BREATHING PRACTICES, RELAXATION TECHNIQUES, AND MEDITATION. PARTICIPANTS IN THE WAIT-LISTED CONTROL GROUP FOLLOWED THEIR NORMAL ROUTINE. ANXIETY, FATIGUE, DEPRESSION, AND QOL WERE ASSESSED TWICE FOR ALL SUBJECTS IN EACH GROUP - ONCE AT THE START OF THE STUDY TO ESTABLISH A BASELINE AND ONCE MORE AT THE END OF THE 2-MONTH STUDY PERIOD TO ASSESS ANY CHANGES. DATA ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED ON THE ASSESSMENTS USING SPSS SOFTWARE VERSION 10. RESULTS: BETWEEN GROUP ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATED THAT A SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT REDUCTION IN ANXIETY (P<0.001), DEPRESSION (P<0.001), AND FATIGUE (P<0.001) WAS OBSERVED IN THE YOGA GROUP COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP, AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN WELL-BEING (P<0.001) AND ALL DOMAINS OF QOL (P<0.001) IN THE YOGA GROUP COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY INDICATES THAT YOGA INTERVENTION APPEARS TO IMPROVE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH AND QOL OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HIV-POSITIVE. THEREFORE, BASED ON THESE FINDINGS, YOGA MAY BE RECOMMENDED AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY TO ENHANCE CONVENTIONAL HIV CARE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
14  909  43 EFFECTIVENESS OF GROUP VERSUS INDIVIDUAL YOGA EXERCISES ON FATIGUE OF PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. BACKGROUND: MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS DISORDERS POSES HEAVY PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL EFFECT ON PATIENTS WHO ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DISEASE. AIM: THIS STUDY AIMED TO COMPARE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INDIVIDUAL VERSUS GROUP EXERCISES ON FATIGUE ON PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IN THIS CLINICAL TRIAL, 85 PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS WERE DIVIDED IN TWO GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALIZED EXERCISE AND TEAM EXERCISE. THE INTERVENTION WAS CONDUCTED FOR 6 WEEKS AND COMPRISED OF MILD STRETCHING AND BASIC YOGA EXERCISES TWICE A DAY. THE DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH DEMOGRAPHIC QUESTIONNAIRE, STANDARD FATIGUE SCALE AND SELF-REPORTED CHECKLIST. DATA ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED BY SPSS SOFTWARE. RESULTS: THE MEAN LEVELS OF FATIGUE PERCEPTION AFTER THE INTERVENTION IN GROUP EXERCISE WAS 27.9 +/- 15.9 AND 27.1 +/- 17.2 IN INDIVIDUAL EXERCISE. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS (P > 0.05). STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED IN THE MEAN LEVEL OF PERCEIVED FATIGUE IN TRIPLICATE MEASUREMENTS (P = 0.013) AMONG PATIENTS WHO COMPLETED INDIVIDUAL EXERCISE. HOWEVER, THIS DIFFERENCE WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT IN THE GROUP EXERCISE. CONCLUSION: PERFORMING MILD STRETCHING EXERCISES AND BASIC YOGA ARE RECOMMENDED AS A COST-EFFECTIVE METHOD WHICH IS EASY TO PERFORM AMONG PATIENTS WITH MILD TO MODERATE DISABILITIES.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
15  870  40 EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY ON ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY-OF-LIFE AMONG CAREGIVERS OF IN-PATIENTS WITH NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AT A TERTIARY CARE CENTER IN INDIA: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. CONTEXT: THE CONCERNS OF CAREGIVERS OF PATIENTS WITH NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS HAVE BEEN A FELT NEED FOR A LONG TIME, WITH MANY OF THEM EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT PSYCHIATRIC MORBIDITY. AIMS: THIS STUDY AIMED TO FIND THE EFFECT OF YOGA IN REDUCING ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, AS WELL AS IMPROVING QUALITY-OF-LIFE IN CAREGIVERS OF PATIENTS WITH NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED USING A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED DESIGN, WITH YOGA INTERVENTION AND WAITLISTED CONTROLS. METHODOLOGY: SIXTY CONSENTING CAREGIVERS OF INPATIENTS IN NEUROLOGY WARDS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS: YOGA AND CONTROL. DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES EXCEPT YEARS OF EDUCATION AND LENGTH OF CARETAKING WERE COMPARABLE IN THE TWO GROUPS, AS ALSO BASELINE SCORES OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND QUALITY-OF-LIFE. A SPECIFIC YOGA MODULE COMPRISING YOGASANAS, PRANAYAMA, AND CHANTING WAS TAUGHT TO THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP BY THE RESEARCHER. AT FOLLOW-UP 43 PATIENTS (YOGA N=20 AND CONTROL GROUP N=23) WERE AVAILABLE. TWO-WAY REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE WAS USED TO TEST THE CHANGE FROM PRE-TEST TO POST-TEST SCORES WITHIN AND BETWEEN GROUPS. ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE WAS PERFORMED TO COMPARE THE POST-TEST SCORES BETWEEN THE GROUPS ADJUSTING FOR EDUCATION AND LENGTH OF CARETAKING. RESULTS: FOLLOWING ONE MONTH INTERVENTION OF YOGA THERAPY, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT (P<0.001) DECREASE IN ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCORES, AS WELL AS IMPROVED QUALITY-OF-LIFE AMONG THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP AS COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THE USEFULNESS OF A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR CAREGIVERS OF INPATIENTS WITH NEUROLOGICAL PROBLEMS. THE SMALL SAMPLE SIZE AND LACK OF BLINDING WERE SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
16 2000  35 STRESS MANAGEMENT: A RANDOMIZED STUDY OF COGNITIVE BEHAVIOURAL THERAPY AND YOGA. IN THIS STUDY, A STRESS MANAGEMENT PROGRAM BASED ON COGNITIVE BEHAVIOURAL THERAPY PRINCIPLES WAS COMPARED WITH A KUNDALINIYOGA PROGRAM. A STUDY SAMPLE OF 26 WOMEN AND 7 MEN FROM A LARGE SWEDISH COMPANY WERE DIVIDED RANDOMLY INTO 2 GROUPS FOR EACH OF THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF INTERVENTION; A TOTAL OF 4 GROUPS. THE GROUPS WERE INSTRUCTED BY TRAINED GROUP LEADERS AND 10 SESSIONS WERE HELD WITH EACH OF GROUPS, OVER A PERIOD OF 4 MONTHS. PSYCHOLOGICAL (SELF-RATED STRESS AND STRESS BEHAVIOUR, ANGER, EXHAUSTION, QUALITY OF LIFE) AND PHYSIOLOGICAL (BLOOD PRESSURE, HEART RATE, URINARY CATECHOLAMINES, SALIVARY CORTISOL) MEASUREMENTS OBTAINED BEFORE AND AFTER TREATMENT SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS ON MOST OF THE VARIABLES IN BOTH GROUPS AS WELL AS MEDIUM-TO-HIGH EFFECT SIZES. HOWEVER, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND BETWEEN THE 2 PROGRAMS. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT BOTH COGNITIVE BEHAVIOUR THERAPY AND YOGA ARE PROMISING STRESS MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES.	2006	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
17 1823  45 PSYCHO-BIOLOGICAL CHANGES WITH ADD ON YOGA NIDRA IN PATIENTS WITH MENSTRUAL DISORDERS: A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: MENSTRUAL DISORDERS ARE COMMON PROBLEMS AMONG WOMEN IN THE REPRODUCTIVE AGE GROUP. YUGA INTERVENTIONS MAY DECREASE THE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS RELATED TO MENSTRUAL DISORDERS. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS AIMED TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF YOGA NIDRA ON PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS IN PATIENTS WITH MENSTRUAL DISORDERS. METHODS: A TOTAL NUMBER OF 100 WOMEN RECRUITED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY AND WERE THEN RANDOMLY ALLOCATED INTO TWO GROUPS: A) INTERVENTION RECEIVED YOGIC INTERVENTION AND MEDICATION FOR 6 MONTH, AND B) CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED NO YOGIC INTERVENTION AND THEY ONLY RECEIVED PRESCRIBED MEDICATION). PSYCHOLOGICAL GENERAL WELL-BEING INDEX (PGWBI) AND HORMONAL PROFILE WERE ASSESSED AT THE TIME OF BEFORE AND AFTER SIX MONTHS ON BOTH GROUPS. RESULTS: THE MEAN SCORE OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, POSITIVE WELL-BEING, GENERAL HEALTH, AND VITALITY SCORES, AS WELL AS HORMONAL LEVELS, IN POSTTEST WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT IN INTERVENTION GROUP AS COMPARED WITH PRETEST. BUT THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: YOGA NIDRA CAN BE A SUCCESSFUL THERAPY TO OVERCOME THE PSYCHIATRIC MORBIDITY ASSOCIATED WITH MENSTRUAL IRREGULARITIES. THEREFORE, YOGIC RELAXATION TRAINING (YOGA NIDRA) COULD BE PRESCRIBED AS AN ADJUNCT TO CONVENTIONAL DRUG THERAPY FOR MENSTRUAL DYSFUNCTION.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
18 2215  33 THE IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF MODIFIED YOGA POSITIONS ON MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN RELIEF. MANY MUSCULOSKELETAL PAINS ARE RELATED TO POOR POSTURE. THUS, THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFICIENCY OF A SINGLE SESSION OF TWO MODIFIED YOGA POSITIONS WITH 110 SUBJECTS AND THEIR 147 PAIN-RELATED COMPLAINTS. THE PARTICIPANTS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: THE YOGA GROUP, WHICH RECEIVED TREATMENT OF TWO 20-MIN POSTURES AND THE CONTROL GROUP, WHICH RECEIVED A PLACEBO TREATMENT OF 15 MIN WITH A TURNED OFF ULTRASOUND. ALL VOLUNTEERS EXPERIENCED SOME PAIN BEFORE TREATMENT AND WERE ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER TREATMENT USING THE ANALOG PAIN SCALE. A SCORE OF 0 INDICATED NO PAIN WHEREAS 10 WAS THE MAXIMUM DEGREE OF PAIN ON THE SCALE. THE DIFFERENCE BEFORE AND AFTER TREATMENT WAS COMPARED BETWEEN THE GROUPS WITH A P-VALUE OF 0.0001, AS MEASURED BY THE STUDENT'S T-TEST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO CONCLUDE THAT ONE THERAPY SESSION IS EFFECTIVE IN THE TREATMENT OF VARIOUS MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
19 1542  33 KRIYA YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES DESPITE THE EASY ACCEPTABILITY AND HOLISTIC NATURE OF KRIYA YOGA, THERE ARE NO STUDIES EVALUATING THE ROLE OF KRIYA YOGA INTERVENTION ON DEPRESSION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE CURRENT STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFECT OF ADJUNCTIVE KRIYA YOGA ON DEPRESSION. METHODS PATIENTS WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER WHO OPTED FOR KRIYA YOGA WERE RECRUITED INTO THE INTERVENTION GROUP (ADJUNCTIVE KRIYA YOGA) AND THOSE ON PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION ALONE WERE ENROLLED INTO THE CONTROL GROUP. THE HAMILTON DEPRESSION RATING SCALE (HDRS) MEASUREMENTS WERE RECORDED AT BASELINE, END OF 2, 4, AND 8 WEEKS. RESULTS HDRS SCORES OF THE INTERVENTION GROUP ( N = 29) WERE FOUND TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY LESSER THAN THAT OF THE CONTROL GROUP ( N = 52) BY THE END OF 2, 4, AND 8 WEEKS. THE REMISSION RATE WAS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP. CONCLUSION KRIYA YOGA INTERVENTION WAS FOUND TO BE FEASIBLE, AS WELL AS IMPROVED THE SEVERITY OF DEPRESSION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
20  813  39 EFFECT OF YOGA ON CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTIONS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF PEOPLE ON PUBLIC SERVICE-RELATED WORK: AN EXPLORATORY STUDY. OBJECTIVES: YOGA IS INCREASINGLY BEING INTRODUCED IN WORKPLACE SETTINGS TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. HOWEVER, THERE IS A LACK OF STUDIES REPORTING THE EFFECT OF YOGA IN PEOPLE ON PUBLIC SERVICE-RELATED WORK, WHO ARE AT HIGH RISK FOR VARIOUS HEALTH-RELATED PROBLEMS. THUS, THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO FIND THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTIONS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL (STRESS, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION) ASPECTS OF PEOPLE ON PUBLIC SERVICE-RELATED WORK. METHODS: A SINGLE-GROUP PRE-TEST AND POST-TEST EXPERIMENTAL STUDY DESIGN WAS ADOPTED. EIGHTY-TWO PARTICIPANTS AGED 41.52 +/- 7.44 YEARS WHO ARE WORKING IN THE TAMIL NADU PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION WERE UNDERGONE 1-H OF YOGA (UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A YOGA & NATUROPATHY DOCTOR) A DAY, 5-DAYS A WEEK FOR A PERIOD OF 1-MONTH AT THEIR OFFICE. CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTIONS SUCH AS SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (SBP), DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (DBP), AND PULSE RATE (PR) WERE MEASURED USING AN AUTOMATIC BP MONITOR. PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIABLES SUCH AS STRESS, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION WERE MEASURED USING DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND STRESS SCALES (DASS) BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION. RESULTS: RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN BODY MASS INDEX, SBP, DBP, PR, MEAN ARTERIAL PRESSURE, RATE PRESSURE PRODUCT, AND DOUBLE PRODUCT. THOUGH RESULTS SHOWED INSIGNIFICANT (JUST MISSED THE STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE [P=0.056]) REDUCTION IN ANXIETY, IT SHOWED CLINICAL IMPROVEMENT (I.E. THE MEAN ANXIETY SCORE HAS REDUCED FROM MODERATE CATEGORY TO MILD CATEGORY). HOWEVER, THERE IS NEITHER STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT NOR CLINICAL DIFFERENCE IN STRESS AND DEPRESSION. NONE OF THE PARTICIPANTS REPORTED ANY UNTOWARD EVENTS DURING THE STUDY PERIOD. CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA MIGHT IMPROVE THE CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTIONS AND ANXIETY OF PEOPLE IN PUBLIC SERVICE-RELATED WORK. HOWEVER, NO SUCH SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT WAS NOTED IN THEIR STRESS AND DEPRESSION LEVELS. HOWEVER, A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IS REQUIRED TO WARRANT THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY.	2021

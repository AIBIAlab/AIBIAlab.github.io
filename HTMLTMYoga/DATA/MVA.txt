1  179 108 A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF THE INFLUENCE OF YOGA FOR WOMEN WITH SYMPTOMS OF POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. BACKGROUND: SURVIVORS IN MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENT (MVA) MAY HAVE POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD). YOGA IS A COMPLEMENTARY APPROACH FOR PTSD THERAPY. METHODS: THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL EXPLORED WHETHER YOGA INTERVENTION HAS EFFECTS ON REDUCING THE SYMPTOMS OF PTSD IN WOMEN SURVIVED IN MVA. PARTICIPANTS (N = 94) WERE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED INTO CONTROL GROUP OR YOGA GROUP. PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED 6 45-MINUITE YOGA SESSIONS IN 12 WEEKS. DEPRESSION ANXIETY STRESS SCALES (DASS) AND IMPACT OF EVENTS SCALE-REVISED (IES-R) WERE USED TO ASSESS PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. RESULTS: POST-INTERVENTION IES-R TOTAL SCORE OF YOGA GROUP WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THAT OF CONTROL GROUP (P = 0.01). AT BOTH POST-INTERVENTION AND 3-MONTHS POST INTERVENTION, THE DASS-21 TOTAL SCORES OF YOGA GROUP WERE BOTH SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THOSE OF CONTROL GROUP (P = 0.043, P = 0.024). YOGA GROUP SHOWED LOWER ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION LEVEL COMPARED TO CONTROL GROUP AT BOTH POST-INTERVENTION (P = 0.033, P < 0.001) AND POST-FOLLOW-UP (P = 0.004, P = 0.035). YOGA GROUP HAD LOWER LEVELS OF INTRUSION AND AVOIDANCE COMPARED TO CONTROL GROUP AFTER INTERVENTION (P = 0.002, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: RESULTS ILLUSTRATE THAT YOGA INTERVENTION MAY ALLEVIATE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AND IMPROVE THE SYMPTOMS OF PTSD IN WOMEN WITH PTSD FOLLOWING MVA.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
2 2021  20 SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF YOGA AND BALANCE: EFFECT ON ADULTS WITH NEUROMUSCULAR IMPAIRMENT. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW EXAMINES THE EFFICACY OF YOGA AS A NEUROMUSCULAR INTERVENTION FOR COMMUNITY-DWELLING POPULATIONS AT RISK FOR FALLS TO DETERMINE ITS UTILITY FOR USE IN OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY INTERVENTION. POPULATIONS INCLUDED OLDER ADULTS AND ADULTS WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI), CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT (CVA), DEMENTIA AND ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD)-TYPE DEMENTIA, MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS), AND PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD). BENEFITS OF YOGA INCLUDE IMPROVED POSTURE CONTROL, IMPROVED FLEXIBILITY OF MIND AND BODY, RELAXATION, AND DECREASED ANXIETY AND STRESS. A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE WAS CONDUCTED TO UNDERSTAND THE SALUTARY BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR CLIENTS WHO ARE AT RISK FOR FALLS BECAUSE OF NEUROMUSCULAR ISSUES. MODERATE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE USE OF YOGA TO DECREASE THE RISK FOR FALLS FOR COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH CVA, DEMENTIA AND AD-TYPE DEMENTIA, AND MS. STUDIES INVOLVING PEOPLE WITH TBI AND PD DID NOT INCLUDE STRONG ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A CLEAR CLASSIFICATION.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
3 2595  29 YOGA FOR MILITARY SERVICE PERSONNEL WITH PTSD: A SINGLE ARM STUDY. THIS STUDY EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) SYMPTOMS, RESILIENCE, AND MINDFULNESS IN MILITARY PERSONNEL. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETING THE YOGA INTERVENTION WERE 12 CURRENT OR FORMER MILITARY PERSONNEL WHO MET THE DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL FOR MENTAL DISORDERS-FOURTH EDITION-TEXT REVISION (DSM-IV-TR) DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR PTSD. RESULTS WERE ALSO BENCHMARKED AGAINST OTHER MILITARY INTERVENTION STUDIES OF PTSD USING THE CLINICIAN ADMINISTERED PTSD SCALE (CAPS; BLAKE ET AL., 2000) AS AN OUTCOME MEASURE. RESULTS OF WITHIN-SUBJECT ANALYSES SUPPORTED THE STUDY'S PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS THAT YOGA WOULD REDUCE PTSD SYMPTOMS (D = 0.768; T = 2.822; P = .009) BUT DID NOT SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT YOGA WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE MINDFULNESS (D = 0.392; T = -0.9500; P = .181) AND RESILIENCE (D = 0.270; T = -1.220; P = .124) IN THIS POPULATION. BENCHMARKING RESULTS INDICATED THAT, AS COMPARED WITH THE AGGREGATED TREATMENT BENCHMARK (D = 1.074) OBTAINED FROM PUBLISHED CLINICAL TRIALS, THE CURRENT STUDY'S TREATMENT EFFECT (D = 0.768) WAS VISIBLY LOWER, AND COMPARED WITH THE WAITLIST CONTROL BENCHMARK (D = 0.156), THE TREATMENT EFFECT IN THE CURRENT STUDY WAS VISIBLY HIGHER.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
4 2164  34 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND SELF-ESTEEM ON MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS-A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS FOUND THAT YOGA CAN ENHANCE QUALITY OF LIFE AND EASE MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. THE STUDY EXAMINED WHETHER SELF-ESTEEM MEDIATED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE, FATIGUE AND MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS, UTILIZING VALIDATED OUTCOME MEASURES. STUDY DESIGN: THIS IS A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA WITH THOSE OF USUAL CARE IN 40 BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WHO SUFFERED FROM MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS. ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED ALL 3 ASSESSMENTS (WEEK 0, WEEK 12, AND WEEK 24) AND PROVIDED FULL DATA. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: OUTCOMES WERE MEASURED USING SELF-RATING INSTRUMENTS. MEDIATION ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED USING SPSS. RESULTS: SELF-ESTEEM MEDIATED THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON TOTAL MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS (B=-2.11, 95% BCI [-5.40 TO -0.37]), PSYCHOLOGICAL MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS (B=-0.94, 95% BCI [-2.30 TO -0.01]), AND UROGENITAL MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS (B=-0.66, 95% BCI [-1.65 TO -0.15]), QUALITY OF LIFE (B=8.04, 95% BCI [3.15-17.03]), SOCIAL WELL-BEING (B=1.80, 95% BCI [0.54-4.21]), EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING (B=1.62, 95% BCI [0.70-3.34]), FUNCTIONAL WELL-BEING (B=1.84, 95% BCI [0.59-4.13]), AND FATIGUE (B=4.34, 95% BCI [1.28-9.55]). SELF-ESTEEM HAD NO EFFECT ON SOMATOVEGETATIVE MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS (B=-0.50, 95% BCI N.S.) OR ON PHYSICAL WELL-BEING (B=0.79, 95% BCI N.S.). CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS SUPPORT THE ASSUMPTION THAT SELF-ESTEEM PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF YOGA AND THAT YOGA CAN HAVE LONG-TERM BENEFITS FOR WOMEN DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER AND UNDERGOING MENOPAUSAL TRANSITION.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
5 1229  25 FEASIBILITY AND IMPACT OF AN 8-WEEK INTEGRATIVE YOGA PROGRAM IN PEOPLE WITH MODERATE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS-RELATED DISABILITY: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: THIS PILOT STUDY DETERMINED THE FEASIBILITY OF A SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED 8-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE WITH MODERATE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS)-RELATED DISABILITY. WE EXPLORED THE PROGRAM'S EFFECT ON QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AND PHYSICAL AND MENTAL PERFORMANCE. METHODS: WE USED A SINGLE-GROUP DESIGN WITH REPEATED MEASUREMENTS AT BASELINE, POSTINTERVENTION, AND 8-WEEK FOLLOW-UP. FEASIBILITY WAS EXAMINED THROUGH COST, RECRUITMENT, RETENTION, ATTENDANCE, AND SAFETY. OUTCOMES INCLUDED THE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS QUALITY OF LIFE INVENTORY (MSQLI), 12-ITEM MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS WALKING SCALE (MSWS-12), TIMED 25-FOOT WALK TEST (T25FW), 6-MINUTE WALK TEST (6MWT), NINE-HOLE PEG TEST (NHPT), FIVE-TIMES SIT-TO-STAND TEST (FTSTS), MULTIDIRECTIONAL REACH TEST (MDRT), MAXIMUM EXPIRATORY PRESSURE, AND PACED AUDITORY SERIAL ADDITION TEST-3'' (PASAT-3''). RESULTS: FOURTEEN PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE STUDY. THE PROGRAM WAS FEASIBLE. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT MAIN EFFECTS ON THE 36-ITEM SHORT FORM HEALTH STATUS SURVEY MENTAL COMPONENT SUMMARY (SF-36 MCS), MODIFIED FATIGUE IMPACT SCALE (MFIS), BLADDER CONTROL SCALE (BLCS), PERCEIVED DEFICITS QUESTIONNAIRE (PDQ), MENTAL HEALTH INVENTORY (MHI), MSWS-12, T25FW, NHPT, PASAT-3'', 6MWT, FTSTS, AND MDRT-BACK. IMPROVEMENTS WERE FOUND ON THE SF-36 MCS, MFIS, BLCS, PDQ, MHI, AND MSWS-12 BETWEEN BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION. THE EFFECT ON PDQ PERSISTED AT FOLLOW-UP. IMPROVEMENTS WERE FOUND ON THE T25FW, NHPT, 6MWT, FTSTS, AND MDRT-BACK BETWEEN BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION THAT PERSISTED AT FOLLOW-UP. THE PASAT-3'' DID NOT CHANGE BETWEEN BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION BUT DID BETWEEN POSTINTERVENTION AND FOLLOW-UP. CONCLUSIONS: THE YOGA PROGRAM WAS SAFE AND FEASIBLE. IMPROVEMENTS IN CERTAIN MEASURES OF QOL AND PERFORMANCE WERE SEEN AT POSTINTERVENTION AND FOLLOW-UP.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
6  534  25 COMPARISON OF YOGA AND WALKING-EXERCISE ON CARDIAC TIME INTERVALS AS A MEASURE OF CARDIAC FUNCTION IN ELDERLY WITH INCREASED PULSE PRESSURE. OBJECTIVE: ARTERIAL AGING ALONG WITH INCREASED BLOOD PRESSURE(BP) HAS BECOME THE MAJOR CARDIOVASCULAR(CV) RISK IN ELDERLY. THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA PROGRAM AND WALKING-EXERCISE ON CARDIAC FUNCTION IN ELDERLY WITH INCREASED PULSE PRESSURE (PP). METHODS: AN OPEN LABEL, PARALLEL-GROUP RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY DESIGN WAS ADOPTED. ELDERLY INDIVIDUALS AGED >/=60 YEARS WITH PP>/=60MMHG WERE RECRUITED FOR THE STUDY. YOGA (STUDY) GROUP (N=30) WAS ASSIGNED FOR YOGA TRAINING AND WALKING (EXERCISE) GROUP (N=30) FOR WALKING WITH LOOSENING PRACTICES FOR ONE HOUR IN THE MORNING FOR 6DAYS IN A WEEK FOR 3 MONTHS. THE OUTCOME MEASURES WERE CARDIAC TIME INTERVALS DERIVED FROM PULSE WAVE ANALYSIS AND ECG: RESTING HEART RATE (RHR), DIASTOLIC TIME(DT), VENTRICULAR EJECTION TIME(LVET), UPSTROKE TIME(UT), EJECTION DURATION INDEX (ED%), PRE-EJECTION PERIOD (PEP), RATE PRESSURE PRODUCT (RPP) AND PERCENTAGE OF MEAN ARTERIAL PRESSURE (%MAP). RESULTS: THE MEAN WITHIN-YOGA GROUP CHANGE IN RHR(BPM) WAS 4.41 (P=0.031), PD(MS): -50.29 (P=0.042), DT(MS): -49.04 (P=0.017), ED%: 2.107 (P=0.001), ES(MMHG/MS): 14.62 (P=0.118), ET(MS): -0.66 (P=0.903), UT(MS): -2.54 (P=0.676), PEP(MS): -1.25 (P=0.11) AND %MAP: 2.08 (P=0.04). THE MEAN WITHIN-CONTROL GROUP CHANGE IN HR (BPM) WAS 0.35 (P=0.887), PD (MS): 11.15(P=0.717), DT (MS): 11.3 (P=0.706), ED%: -0.101 (P=0.936), ES (MMHG/MS): 0.75 (P=0.926), ET(MS): 2.2 (P=0.721), UT(MS):4.7(P=455), PEP (MS): 2.1(P=0.11), %MAP: 0.65 (P=0.451). A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN-GROUP WAS FOUND IN RHR (P=0.036), PD (P=0.02), ED% (P=0.049), LVET (P=0.048), DT (P=0.02) AND RPP (P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: YOGA PRACTICE FOR 3 MONTHS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN DIASTOLIC FUNCTION WITH A MINIMAL CHANGE IN SYSTOLIC FUNCTION. YOGA IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN WALKING IN IMPROVING CARDIAC FUNCTION IN ELDERLY WITH HIGH PP.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
7 1536  22 KETAMINE, TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION, AND DEPRESSION SPECIFIC YOGA AND MINDFULNESS BASED COGNITIVE THERAPY IN MANAGEMENT OF TREATMENT RESISTANT DEPRESSION: REVIEW AND SOME DATA ON EFFICACY. DEPRESSION AFFECTS ABOUT 121 MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE AND PREVALENCE OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD) IN US ADULTS IS 6.4%. TREATMENT RESISTANT DEPRESSION (TRD) ACCOUNTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 12-20% OF ALL DEPRESSION PATIENTS AND COSTS $29-$48 BILLION ANNUALLY. KETAMINE AND REPETITIVE TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION (RTMS) HAVE USEFUL ROLES IN TRD, BUT THEIR UTILITY IN LONG TERM IS UNKNOWN. AS PER THE LATEST LITERATURE, THE INTERVENTIONS USING YOGA AND MEDITATION INCLUDING THE MINDFULNESS BASED COGNITIVE THERAPY (MBCT) HAVE BEEN USEFUL IN TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION AND RELAPSE PREVENTION. WE PRESENT A REVIEW OF RTMS, KETAMINE, AND MBCT AND ALSO REPORT EFFICACY OF A DEPRESSION SPECIFIC, INNOVATIVE, AND TRANSLATIONAL MODEL OF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS BASED COGNITIVE THERAPY (DEPS Y-MBCT), DEVELOPED BY THE FIRST AUTHOR. DEPS Y-MBCT AS AN ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT SUCCESSFULLY AMELIORATED TRD SYMPTOMS IN 27/32 PATIENTS IN AN OPEN LABEL PILOT TRIAL IN TRD PATIENTS. CONSIDERING THE LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING TREATMENT OPTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE OF KETAMINE AND RTMS WHEN USED AS THE SOLE MODALITY OF TREATMENT, WE SUGGEST A "TIERED APPROACH FOR TRD" BY COMBINING KETAMINE AND RTMS (ALONE OR ALONG WITH ANTIDEPRESSANTS) FOR RAPID REMISSION OF ACUTE DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AND TO USE DEPS Y-MBCT FOR MAINTAINING REMISSION AND PREVENTING RELAPSE.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
8 2771  24 YOGA REDUCES SYMPTOMS OF DISTRESS IN TSUNAMI SURVIVORS IN THE ANDAMAN ISLANDS. A MONTH AFTER THE DECEMBER 2004 TSUNAMI THE EFFECT OF A 1 WEEK YOGA PROGRAM WAS EVALUATED ON SELF RATED FEAR, ANXIETY, SADNESS AND DISTURBED SLEEP IN 47 SURVIVORS IN THE ANDAMAN ISLANDS. POLYGRAPH RECORDINGS OF THE HEART RATE, BREATH RATE AND SKIN RESISTANCE WERE ALSO MADE. AMONG THE 47 PEOPLE, 31 WERE SETTLERS FROM THE MAINLAND (I.E. INDIA, ML GROUP) AND 16 WERE ENDOGENOUS PEOPLE (EP GROUP). THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN SELF RATED FEAR, ANXIETY, SADNESS AND DISTURBED SLEEP IN BOTH GROUPS, AND IN THE HEART AND BREATH RATE IN THE ML GROUP, AND IN THE BREATH RATE ALONE IN THE EP GROUP, FOLLOWING YOGA (P < 0.05, T-TEST). THIS SUGGESTS THAT YOGA PRACTICE MAY BE USEFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF STRESS FOLLOWING A NATURAL DISASTER IN PEOPLE WITH WIDELY DIFFERING SOCIAL, CULTURAL AND SPIRITUAL BELIEFS.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
9   32  38 5-HTTLPR AND MTHFR 677C>T POLYMORPHISMS AND RESPONSE TO YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION IN MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER: A RANDOMIZED ACTIVE-CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE SUGGESTING THAT BOTH GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS MODULATE TREATMENT OUTCOME IN, A HIGHLY HETEROGENEOUS, MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD). 5-HTTLPR VARIANT OF THE SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER GENE (SLC6A4) AND MTHFR 677C>T POLYMORPHISMS HAVE BEEN LINKED TO THE PATHOGENESIS OF MDD, AND ANTIDEPRESSANT TREATMENT RESPONSE. THE EVIDENCE IS LACKING ON THE CLINICAL UTILITY OF YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH MDD WHO HAVE 5-HTTLPR AND MTHFR 677C>T POLYMORPHISMS AND LESS LIKELY TO RESPOND TO MEDICATIONS (SSRIS). AIMS: WE AIMED TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF YBLI IN THOSE WHO HAVE SUSCEPTIBLE 5-HTTLPR AND MTHFR 677C>T POLYMORPHISMS AND ARE LESS LIKELY TO DRUG THERAPY WITH SSRIS. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: IN A 12 WEEK RANDOMIZED ACTIVE-CONTROLLED TRIAL, MDD PATIENTS (N = 178) WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE YBLI OR DRUG THERAPY. METHODS: GENOTYPING WAS CONDUCTED USING PCR-BASED METHODS. THE CLINICAL REMISSION WAS DEFINED AS BDI-II SCORE </= 9. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: AN INTENT-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED, AND THE ASSOCIATION OF GENOTYPE WITH TREATMENT REMISSION CONSISTED OF THE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL. A P VALUE OF <0.05 WAS CONSIDERED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. RESULTS: MULTIVARIATE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELS FOR REMISSION INCLUDING EITHER 5-HTTLPR OR MTHFR 677C>T GENOTYPES SHOWED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT ODDS OF REMISSION IN YOGA ARM VS. DRUG ARM. NEITHER 5-HTTLPR NOR MTHFR 677C>T GENOTYPE SHOWED ANY INFLUENCE ON REMISSION TO YBLI (P = 0.73 AND P = 0.64, RESPECTIVELY). FURTHER ANALYSIS SHOWED CHILDHOOD ADVERSITY INTERACT WITH 5-HTTLPR AND MTHFR 677C>T POLYMORPHISMS TO DECREASE TREATMENT RESPONSE IN DRUG TREATMENT ARM, BUT NOT IN YOGA ARM. CONCLUSIONS: YBLI PROVIDES MDD REMISSION IN THOSE WHO HAVE SUSCEPTIBLE 5-HTTLPR AND MTHFR 677C>T POLYMORPHISMS AND ARE RESISTANT TO SSRIS TREATMENT. YBLI MAY BE THERAPEUTIC FOR MDD INDEPENDENT OF HETEROGENEITY IN ITS ETIOPATHOGENESIS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                            
10  717  30 EFFECT OF INTEGRATED YOGA THERAPY ON PAIN, MORNING STIFFNESS AND ANXIETY IN OSTEOARTHRITIS OF THE KNEE JOINT: A RANDOMIZED CONTROL STUDY. AIM: TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF INTEGRATED YOGA ON PAIN, MORNING STIFFNESS AND ANXIETY IN OSTEOARTHRITIS OF KNEES. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PARTICIPANTS WITH OA KNEES (35-80 YEARS) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO YOGA OR CONTROL GROUP. BOTH GROUPS HAD TRANSCUTANEOUS ELECTRICAL STIMULATION AND ULTRASOUND TREATMENT FOLLOWED BY INTERVENTION (40 MIN) FOR TWO WEEKS WITH FOLLOW UP FOR THREE MONTHS. THE INTEGRATED YOGA CONSISTED OF YOGIC LOOSENING AND STRENGTHENING PRACTICES, ASANAS, RELAXATION, PRANAYAMA AND MEDITATION. THE CONTROL GROUP HAD PHYSIOTHERAPY EXERCISES. ASSESSMENTS WERE DONE ON 15(TH) (POST 1) AND 90(TH) DAY (POST 2). RESULTS: RESTING PAIN (NUMERICAL RATING SCALE) REDUCED BETTER (P<0.001, MANN-WHITNEY U TEST) IN YOGA GROUP (POST 1=33.6% AND POST 2=71.8%) THAN CONTROL GROUP (POST 1=13.4% AND POST 2=37.5%). MORNING STIFFNESS DECREASED MORE (P<0.001) IN YOGA (POST 1=68.6% AND POST 2=98.1%) THAN CONTROL GROUP (POST 1=38.6% AND POST 2=71.6%). STATE ANXIETY (STAI-1) REDUCED (P<0.001) BY 35.5% (POST 1) AND 58.4% (POST 2) IN THE YOGA GROUP AND 15.6% (POST 1) AND 38.8% (POST 2) IN THE CONTROL GROUP; TRAIT ANXIETY (STAI 2) REDUCED (P<0.001) BETTER (POST 1=34.6% AND POST 2=57.10%) IN YOGA THAN CONTROL GROUP (POST 1=14.12% AND POST 2=34.73%). SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE REDUCED (P<0.001) BETTER IN YOGA GROUP (POST 1=-7.93% AND POST 2=-15.7%) THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (POST 1=-1.8% AND POST 2=-3.8%). DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE REDUCED (P<0.001) BETTER IN YOGA GROUP (POST 1=-7.6% AND POST 2=-16.4%) THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (POST 1=-2.1% AND POST 2=-5.0%). PULSE RATE REDUCED (P<0.001) BETTER IN YOGA GROUP (POST 1=-8.41% AND POST 2=-12.4%) THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (POST 1=-5.1% AND POST 2=-7.1%). CONCLUSION: INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY IS BETTER THAN PHYSIOTHERAPY EXERCISES AS AN ADJUNCT TO TRANSCUTANEOUS ELECTRICAL STIMULATION AND ULTRASOUND TREATMENT IN REDUCING PAIN, MORNING STIFFNESS, STATE AND TRAIT ANXIETY, BLOOD PRESSURE AND PULSE RATE IN PATIENTS WITH OA KNEES.	2012	
                                                                                                      
11 1013  30 EFFECTS OF ONLINE YOGA AND TAI CHI ON PHYSICAL HEALTH OUTCOME MEASURES OF ADULT INFORMAL CAREGIVERS. AIMS: THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF ONLINE VINYASA YOGA (VY) AND TAIJIFIT (12 WEEKS) IN INFORMAL CAREGIVERS (>/=18 YEARS OF AGE). METHODS: TWENTY-NINE PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO TWO GROUPS: VY (N = 16, 55.87 +/- 12.31 YEARS) OR TAIJIFIT (N = 13, 55.07 +/- 12.65 YEARS). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PRIOR TO AND FOLLOWING THE STUDY, ASSESSMENTS WERE MADE FOR MUSCLE STRENGTH (1-RM LEG PRESS, CHEST PRESS, AND HANDGRIP), MUSCLE ENDURANCE (LEG PRESS AND CHEST PRESS; MAXIMAL NUMBER OF REPETITIONS PERFORMED TO FATIGUE AT 80% AND 70% BASELINE 1-RM, RESPECTIVELY), ABDOMINAL ENDURANCE (MAXIMUM NUMBER OF CONSECUTIVE CURL-UPS TO FATIGUE), TASKS OF FUNCTIONALITY (DYNAMIC BALANCE AND WALKING SPEED), AND FLEXIBILITY (SIT AND REACH). RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OVER TIME FOR MUSCLE STRENGTH, MUSCLE ENDURANCE, TASKS OF FUNCTIONALITY, AND FLEXIBILITY (P = 0.001). THE VY GROUP EXPERIENCED A GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN CHEST PRESS ENDURANCE (VY: PRE 19.25 +/- 5.90, POST 28.06 +/- 7.60 REPS; TAIJIFIT PRE 15.69 +/- 4.49, POST 21.07 +/- 5.85 REPS; P = 0.019) AND ABDOMINAL ENDURANCE (VY: PRE 37.12 +/- 31.26, POST 68.43 +/- 55.07 REPS; TAIJIFIT PRE 19.23 +/- 19.00, POST 32.07 +/- 20.87 REPS; P = 0.034) COMPARED TO THE TAIJIFIT GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: VY AND TAIJIFIT ARE EFFECTIVE FOR IMPROVING MUSCLE STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE, TASKS OF FUNCTIONALITY, AND FLEXIBILITY IN INFORMAL CAREGIVERS. VY LED TO GREATER GAINS IN CHEST PRESS ENDURANCE AND ABDOMINAL CURL-UPS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
12 1433  25 IMPROVING THE DEGREE OF PUBIC ARCH POST-YOGA EXERCISE DURING PREGNANCY. YOGA EXERCISES UNDERTAKEN DURING THE MATERNITY PERIOD MAY REDUCE UNPLEASANT SYMPTOMS DURING PREGNANCY AND REDUCE DELIVERY PAIN. FLEXIBILITY OF THE HIP JOINT IMPROVES THE DEGREE OF PUBIC ARCH CREATED IN AN OPEN-LEG POSTURE AND WIDENS THE PELVIC OUTLET REGION, SHORTENING THE TIME REQUIRED FOR DELIVERY AND FACILITATING EASY DELIVERY. THE DEGREE OF PUBIC ARCH IS RELATED TO THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE HIP JOINT. ALTHOUGH MANY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THE EFFECT OF YOGA EXERCISE DURING PREGNANCY, THE EFFECT ON THE DEGREE OF THE PUBIC ARCH HAS NOT BEEN ELUCIDATED. TO ELUCIDATE WHETHER THE DEGREE OF THE PUBIC ARCH IS IMPROVED BY YOGA EXERCISE DURING PREGNANCY, THIS STUDY ENROLLED 177 PREGNANT SUBJECTS. THE DEGREE OF PUBIC ARCH PRE- AND POST-YOGA EXERCISE WAS MEASURED USING INSTRUMENTS IN AN OPEN-LEG POSTURE (SEATED WITH FEMURS ABDUCTED). THE MEAN PUBIC ARCH PRE- AND POST-YOGA WAS 122.61 AND 127.93 DEGREES, RESPECTIVELY. THE DEGREE OF PUBIC ARCH POST-YOGA SESSIONS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED COMPARED WITH PRE-YOGA SESSIONS (P < 0.01). THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT YOGA EXERCISES DURING THE PREGNANCY PERIOD APPEAR TO IMPROVE THE DEGREE OF PUBIC ARCH.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
13  958  36 EFFECTS OF A YOGA BREATH INTERVENTION ALONE AND IN COMBINATION WITH AN EXPOSURE THERAPY FOR POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AND DEPRESSION IN SURVIVORS OF THE 2004 SOUTH-EAST ASIA TSUNAMI. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY EVALUATED THE EFFECT OF A YOGA BREATH PROGRAM ALONE AND FOLLOWED BY A TRAUMA REDUCTION EXPOSURE TECHNIQUE ON POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AND DEPRESSION IN SURVIVORS OF THE 2004 ASIAN TSUNAMI. METHOD: IN THIS NON-RANDOMIZED STUDY, 183 TSUNAMI SURVIVORS WHO SCORED 50 OR ABOVE ON THE POST-TRAUMATIC CHECKLIST-17 (PCL-17) WERE ASSIGNED BY CAMPS TO ONE OF THREE GROUPS: YOGA BREATH INTERVENTION, YOGA BREATH INTERVENTION FOLLOWED BY 3-8 H OF TRAUMA REDUCTION EXPOSURE TECHNIQUE OR 6-WEEK WAIT LIST. MEASURES FOR POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PCL-17) AND DEPRESSION (BDI-21) WERE PERFORMED AT BASELINE AND AT 6, 12 AND 24 WEEKS. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING ANOVA AND MIXED EFFECTS REGRESSION. RESULTS: THE EFFECT OF TREATMENT VS. CONTROL WAS SIGNIFICANT AT 6 WEEKS (F(2,178) = 279.616, P < 0.001): MEAN PCL-17 DECLINED BY 42.5 +/- 10.0 SD WITH YOGA BREATH, 39.2 +/- 17.2 WITH YOGA BREATH + EXPOSURE AND 4.6 +/- 13.2 IN THE CONTROL.

14  479  25 CLINICAL EFFECT OF NIRGUNDI PATRA PINDA SWEDA AND ASHWAGANDHADI GUGGULU YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SANDHIGATA VATA (OSTEOARTHRITIS). SANDHIGATA VATA IS ONE AMONG THE 80 NANATMAJA VATA VYADHIES. SANDHIGATA VATA AND OSTEOARTHRITIS HAVE COMMON SYMPTOMS, AND HENCE, BOTH ARE CONSIDERED AS SIMILAR ENTITIES BY A MAJORITY OF AYURVEDIC SCHOLARS AND SAME HAS BEEN ADOPTED HERE. OSTEOARTHRITIS IS THE MOST COMMON JOINT DISEASE AMONG HUMAN BEINGS TODAY. IN THIS STUDY, A TOTAL OF 116 PATIENTS WERE REGISTERED, OUT OF THEM 101 PATIENTS HAD COMPLETED THE FULL COURSE OF TREATMENT, WHILE 15 PATIENTS LEFT AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE. THE 101 PATIENTS OF SANDHIGATA VATA WERE TREATED IN TWO GROUPS. GROUP A: IN THIS GROUP 50 PATIENTS OF SANDHIGATA VATA WERE TREATED WITH NIRGUNDI PATRA PINDA SWEDA FOR 21 DAYS AND ASHWAGANDHADI GUGGULU YOGA3 G/DAY FOR 45 DAYS WAS GIVEN ORALLY. GROUP B: IN THIS GROUP 51 PATIENTS OF SANDHIGATA VATA WERE TREATED WITH ONLY ASHWAGANDHADI GUGGULU YOGA 3 G/DAY FOR 45 DAYS. TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF THE THERAPY OBJECTIVELY, ALL THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF SANDHIGATA VATA WERE GIVEN A SCORE, DEPENDING UPON THEIR SEVERITY. ALSO FUNCTIONAL TESTS LIKE WALKING TIME, CLIMBING STAIRS, AND JOINT MOVEMENT, WERE MEASURED AS A CRITERIA FOR ASSESSMENT. BOTH THE GROUPS SHOWED GOOD RESULTS, BUT GROUP B SHOWED BETTER RESULTS IN COMPARISON TO GROUP A.	2011

16 1365  28 IMPACT OF 10-WEEKS OF YOGA PRACTICE ON FLEXIBILITY AND BALANCE OF COLLEGE ATHLETES. BACKGROUND: WITH CLEARER EVIDENCE OF ITS BENEFITS, COACHES, AND ATHLETES MAY BETTER SEE THAT YOGA HAS A ROLE IN OPTIMIZING PERFORMANCE. AIMS: TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON MALE COLLEGE ATHLETES (N = 26). METHODS: OVER A 10-WEEK PERIOD, A YOGA GROUP (YG) OF ATHLETES (N = 14) TOOK PART IN BIWEEKLY YOGA SESSIONS; WHILE A NONYOGA GROUP (NYG) OF ATHLETES (N = 12) TOOK PART IN NO ADDITIONAL YOGA ACTIVITY. PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE OBTAINED IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND AFTER THIS PERIOD. MEASUREMENTS OF FLEXIBILITY AND BALANCE, INCLUDED: SIT-REACH (SR), SHOULDER FLEXIBILITY (SF), AND STORK STAND (SS); DYNAMIC MEASUREMENTS CONSISTED OF JOINT ANGLES (JA) MEASURED DURING THE PERFORMANCE OF THREE DISTINCT YOGA POSITIONS (DOWNWARD DOG [DD]; RIGHT FOOT LUNGE [RFL]; CHAIR [C]). RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT GAINS WERE OBSERVED IN THE YG FOR FLEXIBILITY (SR, P = 0.01; SF, P = 0.03), AND BALANCE (SS, P = 0.05). NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED IN THE NYG FOR FLEXIBILITY AND BALANCE. SIGNIFICANTLY, GREATER JA WERE OBSERVED IN THE YG FOR: RFL (DORSIFLEXION, L-ANKLE; P = 0.04), DD (EXTENSION, R-KNEE, P = 0.04; R-HIP; P = 0.01; FLEXION, R-SHOULDER; P = 0.01) AND C (FLEXION, R-KNEE; P = 0.01). SIGNIFICANT JA DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED IN THE NYG FOR: DD (FLEXION, R-KNEE, P = 0.01: R-HIP, P = 0.05; R-SHOULDER, P = 0.03) AND C (FLEXION R-KNEE, P = 0.01; EXTENSION, R-SHOULDER; P = 0.05). A BETWEEN GROUP COMPARISON REVEALED THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES FOR: RFL (L-ANKLE; P = 0.01), DD (R-KNEE, P = 0.01; R-HIP; P = 0.01), AND C (R-SHOULDER, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS SUGGEST THAT A REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE MAY INCREASE THE FLEXIBILITY AND BALANCE AS WELL AS WHOLE BODY MEASURES OF MALE COLLEGE ATHLETES AND THEREFORE, MAY ENHANCE ATHLETIC PERFORMANCES THAT REQUIRE THESE CHARACTERISTICS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
17 2049  30 THE APPLICATION OF "UPPER-BODY YOGA" IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH ACUTE HIP FRACTURE: A PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, AND SINGLE-BLIND STUDY. PURPOSES: HIP FRACTURE LEADS TO DECREASED ACTIVITY AND AN INCREASED RISK OF PULMONARY COMPLICATIONS. THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO OBSERVE THE LUNG CAPACITY, COUGH CAPACITY OF THE ELDERLY PATIENT WITH ACUTE HIP FRACTURE, AND ASSESS THE EFFECTS AND THE FEASIBILITY OF USING A SPECIAL-DESIGNED "UPPER-BODY YOGA" TRAINING TO TREAT ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH HIP FRACTURE. METHODS: THIS WAS A PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, AND SINGLE-BLIND STUDY. EIGHTY-FOUR SUBJECTS AGED OVER 65 YEARS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO EITHER A CONTROL GROUP OR A YOGA GROUP TO UNDERGO AN ABDOMINAL BREATHING PROGRAM OR AN "UPPER-BODY YOGA" PROGRAM UNTIL 4 WEEKS AFTER SURGERY. THE PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE FORCED VITAL CAPACITY/PREDICTED VALUE (FVC%), PEAK COUGH FLOW (PCF), BARTHEL INDEX (BI), AND THE INCIDENCE OF PNEUMONIA. THE SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE THE RATES OF RIGHT SKILLS AND INCLINATION. RESULTS: THIRTY-NINE SUBJECTS IN THE YOGA GROUP AND 40 SUBJECTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP COMPLETED THIS STUDY. AT THE END OF THE FIRST TRAINING WEEK, FVC% (74.14% +/- 13.11% VS. 70.87% +/- 10.46%, P = 0.231) SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS, WHILE THE VALUE OF PCF (204.80 +/- 33.45 L/MIN VS. 189.06 +/- 34.80 L/MIN, P = 0.048) AND BI (38.59 +/- 8.66 VS. 33.00 +/- 9.32, P = 0.009) IN THE YOGA GROUP WAS HIGHER. AFTER 4 WEEKS OF TREATMENT, FVC%, PCF, AND BI WERE HIGHER IN THE YOGA GROUP (78.83% +/- 13.31 % VS. 72.20% +/- 10.53%, P = 0.016; 216.16 +/- 39.29 L/MIN VS. 194.95 +/- 31.14 L/MIN, P = 0.008; 70.77 +/- 10.23 VS. 65.75 +/- 11.30, P = 0.019). ONE IN THE CONTROL GROUP AND NOBODY IN THE YOGA GROUP WAS DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS IN TERMS OF THE RATES OF RIGHT SKILLS, WHEREAS MORE ELDERLY PEOPLE PREFERRED THE TRAINING PROGRAM OF THE "UPPER-BODY YOGA." CONCLUSION: ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH ACUTE HIP FRACTURES ARE AT RISK OF IMPAIRED LUNG CAPACITY AND INADEQUATE COUGH. "UPPER-BODY YOGA" TRAINING MAY IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF DAILY LIFE, VITAL CAPACITY, AND COUGH FLOW IN ELDERLY PATIENTS, MAKING IT A BETTER CHOICE FOR BEDRIDDEN PATIENTS WITH HIP FRACTURE.	2019	

18  481  25 CLINICAL EFFICACY OF APAMARGA KSHARA YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SHVITRA (VITILIGO). INTRODUCTION: VITILIGO IS A PROGRESSIVE, IDIOPATHIC, PIGMENTATION DISORDER OF THE SKIN, CHARACTERIZED BY HYPOPIGMENTED PATCHES. THIS CONDITION IS COMPARED WITH SHVITRA IN AYURVEDA. MANY AYURVEDIC DRUGS ARE BENEFICIAL IN SUCH CASES AND APAMARGA KSHARA YOGA IS ONE AMONG THEM. AIM: TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF APAMARGA KSHARA YOGA IN LEPA AND OINTMENT FORMS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SHVITRA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TOTAL 50 PATIENTS OF SHVITRA WERE RANDOMLY GROUPED INTO TWO. PATIENTS REGISTERED IN GROUP A (N = 25) WERE TREATED WITH APAMARGA KSHARA YOGA LEPA AND GROUP B (N = 25) WITH APAMARGA KSHARA YOGA OINTMENT FOR 2 MONTHS. RASAYANA CHURNA (3G) ALONG WITH HONEY AND GHEE WAS GIVEN TWICE DAILY INTERNALLY IN THE BOTH GROUPS. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT WAS FOUND IN THE SYMPTOMS OF SHVITRA WITH TREATMENT IN BOTH THE GROUPS. THE DIFFERENCE IN BETWEEN THE GROUPS WAS STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT. CONCLUSION: BOTH FORMS OF APAMRAGA KSHARA YOGA ARE EFFECTIVE IN CASES OF SHVITRA AND CAN BE GOOD ALTERNATIVES FOR CONTEMPORARY MEDICINES.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
19 1019  35 EFFECTS OF WEEKLY ONE-HOUR HATHA YOGA THERAPY ON RESILIENCE AND STRESS LEVELS IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA-SPECTRUM DISORDERS: AN EIGHT-WEEK RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA THERAPY ON RESILIENCE, BRAIN-DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR (BDNF) LEVELS, AND SALIVARY ALPHA AMYLASE (SAA) ACTIVITY IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA-SPECTRUM DISORDERS. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: SINGLE-BLINDED, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY IN WHICH OUTPATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA OR RELATED PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS (ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES, 10TH REVISION) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A YOGA OR A CONTROL GROUP. SETTING: NOVEMBER 2012-APRIL 2013 AT YAMANASHI PREFECTURAL KITA HOSPITAL, JAPAN. INTERVENTIONS: IN THE YOGA GROUP, PATIENTS RECEIVED WEEKLY 1-HOUR HATHA YOGA SESSIONS, IN ADDITION TO REGULAR TREATMENT, FOR 8 WEEKS. THOSE IN THE CONTROL GROUP UNDERWENT REGULAR TREATMENT, WHICH INCLUDED A DAYCARE REHABILITATION PROGRAM. OUTCOME MEASURES: ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED THE 25-ITEM RESILIENCE SCALE (RS), POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SYNDROME SCALE (PANSS), PLASMA AND SALIVARY BDNF LEVEL, AND SAA ACTIVITY. RESULTS: FIFTY PATIENTS PARTICIPATED (25 IN EACH GROUP; MEAN AGE+/-STANDARD DEVIATION, 50.9+/-11.3 YEARS; MEAN DURATION OF ILLNESS, 25.0+/-10.3 YEARS; MEAN TOTAL PANSS SCORE, 78.2+/-17.3). NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN CHANGES IN ANY VARIABLE FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 8 WERE FOUND BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS (CHANGES IN THE YOGA GROUP VERSUS THE CONTROL GROUP: RS SCORE, -1.6+/-19.9 VERSUS 0.3+/-17.2; PANSS SCORE, 0.5+/-12.0 VERSUS 5.0+/-15.6; PLASMA BDNF, 41.6+/-377.0 PG/DL VERSUS 73.4+/-346.0 PG/DL; SAA, -26.2+/-72.6 KU/L VERSUS -13.8+/-68.0 KU/L, RESPECTIVELY). CONCLUSIONS: ADJUNCT YOGA THERAPY SHOWED NO POSITIVE CHANGES IN RESILIENCE LEVEL OR STRESS MARKERS. DURATION AND INTENSITY OF YOGA SESSIONS AND THE FOCUS ON PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC ILLNESS MAY EXPLAIN THE NEGATIVE OBSERVATIONS IN LIGHT OF PAST POSITIVE EVIDENCE REGARDING YOGA THERAPY.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
20  954  34 EFFECTS OF A HOLISTIC YOGA PROGRAM ON ENDOCRINE PARAMETERS IN ADOLESCENTS WITH POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS TRIAL WERE TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF A HOLISTIC YOGA PROGRAM WITH THE CONVENTIONAL EXERCISE PROGRAM IN ADOLESCENT POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME (PCOS). DESIGN: THIS WAS A PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, ACTIVE CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: NINETY (90) ADOLESCENT (15-18 YEARS) GIRLS FROM A RESIDENTIAL COLLEGE IN ANDHRA PRADESH WHO SATISFIED THE ROTTERDAM CRITERIA WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS. INTERVENTION: THE YOGA GROUP PRACTICED A HOLISTIC YOGA MODULE, WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP PRACTICED A MATCHING SET OF PHYSICAL EXERCISES (1 HOUR/DAY, FOR 12 WEEKS). OUTCOME MEASURES: ANTI-MULLERIAN HORMONE (AMH-PRIMARY OUTCOME), LUTEINIZING HORMONE (LH), FOLLICLE-STIMULATING HORMONE (FSH), TESTOSTERONE, PROLACTIN, BODY-MASS INDEX (BMI), HIRSUTISM, AND MENSTRUAL FREQUENCY WERE MEASURED AT INCLUSION AND AFTER 12 WEEKS. RESULTS: MANN-WHITNEY TEST ON DIFFERENCE SCORE SHOWS THAT CHANGES IN AMH (Y=-2.51, C=-0.49, P=0.006), LH, AND LH/FSH RATIO (LH: Y=-4.09, C=3.00, P=0.005; LH/FSH: Y=-1.17, C=0.49, P=0.015) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE TWO INTERVENTION GROUPS. ALSO, CHANGES IN TESTOSTERONE (Y=-6.01, C=2.61, P=0.014) AND MODIFIED FERRIMAN AND GALLWAY (MFG) SCORE (Y=-1.14, C=+0.06, P=0.002) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. ON THE OTHER HAND, CHANGES IN FSH AND PROLACTIN POSTINTERVENTION WERE NONSIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. ALSO, BODY WEIGHT AND BMI SHOWED NONSIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT CHANGES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS, WHILE CHANGES IN MENSTRUAL FREQUENCY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS (Y=0.89, C=0.49, P=0.049). CONCLUSIONS: A HOLISTIC YOGA PROGRAM FOR 12 WEEKS IS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN PHYSICAL EXERCISE IN REDUCING AMH, LH, AND TESTOSTERONE, MFG SCORE FOR HIRSUTISM, AND IMPROVING MENSTRUAL FREQUENCY WITH NONSIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN BODY WEIGHT, FSH, AND PROLACTIN IN ADOLESCENT PCOS.	2013

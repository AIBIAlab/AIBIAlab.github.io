1   77 75 A HOLISTIC ANTENATAL MODEL BASED ON YOGA, AYURVEDA, AND VEDIC GUIDELINES. THE PREVALENCE OF PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS ARE ON THE RISE GLOBALLY WITH SEVERE CONSEQUENCES. ACCORDING TO THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO, 2009), EVERY MINUTE, AT LEAST ONE WOMAN DIES AND 20 ARE AFFECTED BY THE COMPLICATIONS RELATED TO PREGNANCY OR CHILDBIRTH. WHILE THE ROOT CAUSE OF PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS IS UNCLEAR, IT LIKELY HAS PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, SOCIAL, AND SPIRITUAL ASPECTS. THE VEDAS ARE A RICH SOURCE OF ANTENATAL HEALTH CARE GUIDELINES IN ALL THESE ASPECTS. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE AUTHORS WAS TO COMPILE THE SCRIPTURAL AND SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE FOR A HOLISTIC ANTENATAL MODEL OF YOGA WITH EMPHASIS ON SOCIOCULTURAL INDIAN PRACTICES.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
2  601 31 DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF A NEED-BASED INTEGRATED YOGA PROGRAM FOR CANCER PATIENTS: A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY. CONTEXT AND AIM: COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES (CAM) ARE GAINING POPULARITY AMONGST PATIENTS AS ADD ON TO CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE. YOGA STANDS THIRD AMONGST ALL CAM THAT IS BEING USED BY CANCER PATIENTS TODAY. DIFFERENT SCHOOLS OF YOGA USE DIFFERENT SETS OF PRACTICES, WITH SOME USING A MORE PHYSICAL APPROACH AND MANY USING MEDITATION AND/OR BREATHING. ALL THESE MODULES ARE DEVELOPED BASED ON THE NEEDS OF THE PATIENT. THIS PAPER IS AN ATTEMPT TO PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR A COMPREHENSIVE NEED BASED INTEGRATIVE YOGA MODULE FOR CANCER PATIENTS AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF TREATMENT AND FOLLOW UP. IN THIS PAPER, THE HOLISTIC MODULES OF THE INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY FOR CANCER (IAYTC) HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BASED ON THE PATIENT NEEDS, AS PER THE OBSERVATIONS BY THE CLINICIANS AND THE CAREGIVERS. AUTHORS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO SYSTEMATICALLY CREATE HOLISTIC MODULES OF IAYTC FOR VARIOUS STAGES OF THE DISEASE AND TREATMENT. THESE MODULES HAVE BEEN USED IN RANDOMIZED TRIALS TO EVALUATE ITS EFFICACY AND HAVE SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE AS ADD-ON TO CONVENTIONAL MANAGEMENT OF CANCER. THUS, THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS EFFORT WAS TO PRESENT THE THEORETICAL BASIS AND VALIDATE THE NEED BASED HOLISTIC YOGA MODULES FOR CANCER PATIENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: LITERATURE FROM TRADITIONAL TEXTS INCLUDING VEDAS, AYURVEDA, UPANISHADS, BHAGAVAT GITA, YOGA VASISHTHA ETC. AND THEIR COMMENTARIES WERE LOOKED INTO FOR REFERENCES OF CANCER AND THERAPEUTIC DIRECTIVES. PRESENT DAY SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE WAS ALSO EXPLORED WITH REGARDS TO DEFINING CANCER, ITS ETIOPATHOLOGY AND ITS MANAGEMENT. RESULTS OF STUDIES DONE USING CAM THERAPIES WERE ALSO LOOKED AT, FOR SALIENT FINDINGS. FOCUSED GROUP DISCUSSIONS (FGD) AMONGST RESEARCHERS, EXPERIENCED GURUS, AND MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS INVOLVED IN RESEARCH AND CLINICAL CANCER PRACTICE WERE CARRIED OUT WITH THE OBJECTIVES OF DETERMINING NEEDS OF THE PATIENT AND YOGA PRACTICES THAT COULD PROVE EFFICIENT. A LIST OF NEEDS AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF CONVENTIONAL THERAPIES (SURGERY, CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIATION THERAPY) WAS LISTED AND YOGA MODULES WERE DEVELOPED ACCORDINGLY. CONSIDERING THE NEEDS, EXPECTED SIDE EFFECTS, THE ENERGY LEVELS AND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL STATES OF THE PARTICIPANTS, EIGHT MODULES EVOLVED. RESULTS: THE RESULTS OF THE SIX STEPS FOR DEVELOPING THE VALIDATED MODULE ARE REPORTED. STEP 1: LITERATURE REVIEW FROM TRADITIONAL YOGA AND AYURVEDA TEXTS ON ETIOPATHOGENESIS AND MANAGEMENT OF CANCER (ARBUDA), AND THE RECENT LITERATURE ON CANCER STEM CELLS AND IMMUNOLOGY OF CANCER. STEP 2: FOCUSED GROUP DISCUSSIONS AND DELIBERATIONS TO COMPILE THE NEEDS OF PATIENTS BASED ON THE EXPECTED SIDE EFFECTS, ENERGY LEVELS AND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE OF THE PATIENT AS OBSERVED BY THE CAREGIVERS AND THE CLINICIANS. STEP 3: CONTENT VALIDATION THROUGH CONSENSUS BY THE EXPERTS FOR THE EIGHT MODULES OF IAYTC THAT COULD BE USED AS COMPLIMENTARY TO CONVENTIONAL MANAGEMENT OF CANCER AT DIFFERENT STAGES DURING AND AFTER THE DIAGNOSIS WAS CREATED. STEP 4: FIELD TESTING FOR SAFETY AND FEASIBILITY OF THE MODULES THROUGH PILOT STUDIES. STEP 5: COMPILATION OF THE RESULTS OF EFFICACY TRIALS THROUGH RCTS AND STEP 6: A REVIEW OF OUR STUDIES ON MECHANISMS TO OFFER EVIDENCE FOR ACTION OF IAYTC ON PSYCHO-NEURO-IMMUNOLOGICAL PATHWAYS IN CANCER. CONCLUSION: THE EVIDENCE FROM THE TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND RECENT SCIENTIFIC STUDIES VALIDATES EIGHT MODULES OF INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY FOR CANCER THAT CAN BE USED SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY AS COMPLIMENTARY DURING ALL CONVENTIONAL CANCER THERAPIES.	2012

YOGA IS ONE OF THE EFFECTIVE WAYS TO REDUCE STRESS WHICH IS ONE OF THE CAUSES OF OBESITY. NOWADAYS, CHILDREN IN ADOLESCENT AGE ARE MORE PRONE TO GET OBESE DUE TO LACK OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY MAKING THEM MORE SEDENTARY. AIM: TO IDENTIFY THE DESIGN AND VALIDATION OF INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY MODULE (IAYTM) FOR OBESITY IN ADOLESCENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FIRST PHASE - IAYTM FOR OBESITY WAS DESIGNED BASED ON THE LITERATURE REVIEW OF CLASSICAL TEXTS AND RECENTLY PUBLISHED RESEARCH ARTICLES. SECOND PHASE - DESIGNED IAYTM WAS VALIDATED BY 16 SUBJECT MATTER (YOGA) EXPERTS. CONTENT-VALIDITY RATIO (CVR) WAS ANALYZED USING LAWSHE'S FORMULA. RESULTS: YOGA PRACTICES WERE DESIGNED FOR INTEGRATED YOGA MODULE FOR OBESITY IN ADOLESCENTS. YOGA PRACTICES WITH CVR >/=0.5 AND WHICH WERE VALIDATED BY 16 YOGA EXPERTS AND APPROVED IN FACULTY GROUP DISCUSSION WERE INCLUDED IN FINAL INTEGRATED YOGA THERAPY MODULE. CONCLUSION: THE YOGA PRACTICES WERE DESIGNED AND VALIDATED FOR IAYTM FOR OBESITY IN ADOLESCENTS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
4 2042 22 THE 'WORLD OF YOGA': THE PRODUCTION AND REPRODUCTION OF THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPES. YOGA IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE FASHIONABLE ALL AROUND THE WORLD. THIS ACTIVITY, PARTLY CONSIDERED AS THERAPEUTIC, REVEALS CONTEMPORARY WAYS OF PRODUCING GLOBAL PRACTICES. VIA A QUESTIONNAIRE COMPLETED BY INDIVIDUALS AT YOGA CENTRES IN INDIA AND FRANCE, THE PAPER ANALYSES THIS PHENOMENON USING THE CONCEPT OF THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPES. FURTHERMORE, IT EXAMINES HOW THESE THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPES ARE INFLUENCED BY GLOBALISATION. BRINGING TOGETHER THE CONCEPTS OF THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPES, GLOBALISATION AND THE PRACTICE OF YOGA, THE PAPER ANALYSES THE PRODUCTION AND REPRODUCTION OF YOGIC THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPES IN THE WORLD'S SPACE. CONSTITUTED OF NATURAL PHYSICAL ELEMENTS AND BUILT STRUCTURES, THESE THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPES ARE ALSO STRONGLY LINKED TO EMOTIONAL QUALITIES AND INTIMATE FEELINGS EVOKED BY THE PLACE AND RELATED TO HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. THE PAPER ALSO UNDERLINES THAT THE EMERGENCE OF INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNISED THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPES DEMANDS A CULTURAL AND SOCIAL GEOGRAPHICAL APPROACH THAT COULD HELP TO EXAMINE THE REPERCUSSIONS OF LOCAL AND GLOBAL PHENOMENA ON THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPES. INDEED, VERY OFTEN, YOGIS, ALL AROUND THE WORLD, REFER TO IDEAL PLACES WHERE THEY RARELY GO. CONSEQUENTLY, THEY CREATE AN IMAGINED THERAPEUTIC ENVIRONMENT THAT THE PAPER DESCRIBES.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
5  400 17 BEYOND THE EAST/WEST DICHOTOMY-THE COURSE YOGA: THEORY AND PRACTICE CONVEYS THE BENEFITS OF AN AYURVEDIC LENS FOR GLOBAL HEALTH. THE COURSE YOGA: THEORY AND PRACTICE (YTP) EVOLVED FROM THE REALIZATION THAT GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC OFFERINGS OF "YOGA COURSES" WERE FILLED BEYOND CAPACITY, WHILE STUDENTS WERE NOT BEING EXPOSED TO THE DEPTH AND BREADTH OF WHAT YOGA HAS TO OFFER AS A HOLISTIC, INTEGRATIVE PRACTICE, NOR HOW IT GREW UP ALONGSIDE AYURVEDA. STUDENTS EXPERIENTIALLY UNDERSTOOD THE CONTRIBUTION THAT YOGA PRACTICE MADE IN THEIR LIVES AND SENSED THE HEALTH BENEFITS IT AFFORDED. YET, THEY WERE HUNGRY FOR AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE LENS THROUGH WHICH YOGA EMERGED. YTP IS AN ELECTIVE COURSE WITHIN AN ACADEMIC MINOR OF STUDY, "INTEGRATIVE APPROACHES TO HEALTH AND WELLNESS" THAT PROVIDES NONWESTERN WAYS OF UNDERSTANDING GLOBAL MEDICINE AND HEALTH. THE FOCUS OF YTP IS TO OFFER COLLEGE STUDENTS AN IN-DEPTH, ACADEMIC STUDY OF YOGA, INCORPORATING BOTH SCIENTIFIC (REDUCTIONIST), AND AN AYURVEDA HEALTH PERSPECTIVE. THIS COURSE IS AN EDUCATIONAL INNOVATION, TRANSLATING THE BENEFITS OF AYURVEDIC AND YOGIC LIFESTYLE TO A WESTERN AUDIENCE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
6 2224 16 THE IMPACT OF THE "YOGIC LIFESTYLE" ON CANCER PROGNOSIS AND SURVIVAL: CAN WE TARGET CANCER STEM CELLS WITH YOGA? CANCER HAS RECENTLY BEEN KNOWN TO ORIGINATE FROM STEM CELL-LIKE CELLS, CALLED CANCER STEM CELLS (CSCS). THEIR UNIQUE PROPERTIES OF SELF-DUPLICATION, MULTIPLICATION, AS WELL AS MIGRATION GIVE THE CSC RESISTANCE OVER CONVENTIONAL CANCER THERAPIES. NEWER THERAPIES ARE IN DEVELOPMENTAL STAGE TO TARGET THESE STEM CELL-LIKE POPULATIONS AND BECOME THE VANGUARD OF FUTURE TREATMENTS. SEVERAL COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS HAVE BEEN USED IN CANCER MANAGEMENT AS AN ADJUNCT TO CONVENTIONAL THERAPY TO IMPROVE THE OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE AND REDUCE RECURRENCE. YOGA STANDS AS THE THIRD MOST POPULAR OF ALL COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE TREATMENTS CURRENTLY USED IN CANCER PATIENTS TODAY. PRELIMINARY RESULTS SHOW THAT YOGA MODULATES NEURAL, HORMONAL, AND IMMUNE FUNCTIONS AT A CELLULAR LEVEL. THE SCOPE OF THIS COMMENTARY IS TO DISCUSS THE CURRENT EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE ON YOGA AND ITS EFFECT ON CSCS.	2017

SUCH INDIRECT EFFECTS MAY BE CAUSED BY HOST CELLULAR FACTORS. YOGA PRACTICES MAY ALSO IMPROVE THE SELF RENEWAL CAPACITY (A STEP THAT PRECEDES COMMITMENT OF CD34+ PROGENITOR CELLS TO TERMINAL DIFFERENTIATION), VIA STAT5 GENE REGULATION. THIS MAY ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR CONSTITUTIVE STAT5 GENE EXPRESSION THROUGH GENE THERAPY. IN THIS ARTICLE RECENT RESEARCH AND ANCIENT INDIAN LITERATURE ARE REVIEWED TO DEVISE YOGA MODULES FOR THE POTENTIAL TREATMENT OF HEMATOPOIETIC INHIBITION IN HIV-1 INFECTION. THE POSSIBLE MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH HEMATOPOIETIC INHIBITION MAY OCCUR IN HIV-1 INFECTED PATIENTS ARE FIRST DESCRIBED FOLLOWED BY THE ROLE OF STRESS IN THE PROGRESSION OF HIV WHERE PROBABLE INVOLVEMENT OF PSYCHO-NEURO-IMMUNOLOGICAL AXIS (PNI) IS HIGHLIGHTED. YOGA THERAPY IS INTRODUCED AND ITS EFFECTIVENESS IN TERMS OF EVIDENCE IN RELEVANT AREA IS REVIEWED. FURTHER, THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY [IAYT] ARE DESCRIBED AND DEPENDING ON THE POTENTIAL MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH YOGA THERAPY MAY ACT, BOTH MODERN SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND ANCIENT "SCRIPTURAL" EVIDENCE ARE PROVIDED AT ALL THE FIVE LEVELS OF EXISTENCE (BODY, LIFE FORCE, EMOTIONAL, INTELLECTUAL AND BLISS). THIS WILL ENABLE TO DESIGN COMPREHENSIVE YOGA MODULES THAT MAY INTERVENE IN THIS INDIRECT INHIBITION OF HAEMATOPOIESIS IN HIV-1 INFECTED INDIVIDUALS AND POTENTIALLY RESTORE NORMAL LEVELS OF HAEMATOPOIESIS.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
8  571 14 DEFINING YOGA-NIDRA: TRADITIONAL ACCOUNTS, PHYSIOLOGICAL RESEARCH, AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS. THE TERM YOGA-NIDRA HAS BEEN USED IN MANY EMPIRICAL STUDIES TO REFER TO RELAXATION AND GUIDED IMAGERY. THESE TECHNIQUES DO NOT REPRESENT THE INTENTION OR PHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATES OF YOGANIDRA DISCUSSED IN THE TRADITIONAL YOGA LITERATURE. WE PROPOSE AN OPERATIONAL DEFINITION OF YOGA-NIDRA THAT IS SUPPORTED BY SEVERAL PHYSIOLOGICALLY TESTABLE HYPOTHESES REGARDING ITS OUTCOMES AND EFFECTS. TRADITIONAL DESCRIPTIONS OF YOGA-NIDRA AND CONTEMPORARY ACCOUNTS OF ITS PRACTICE ARE REVIEWED, AND STUDIES EXAMINING THE PHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATES OF YOGA-NIDRA ARE EXAMINED. PROPOSED HYPOTHESES FOR FUTURE RESEARCH USING THIS OPERATIONAL DEFINITION ARE PROVIDED.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
9 1191 14 EVOLUTION FROM FOUR MENTAL STATES TO THE HIGHEST STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS: A NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS OF MEDITATION AS DEFINED IN YOGA TEXTS. THIS CHAPTER PROVIDES A THEORETICAL INTRODUCTION TO STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS AND REVIEWS NEUROSCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS OF MEDITATION. THE DIFFERENT STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS CONSIST OF FOUR MENTAL STATES, I.E., CANCALATA (RANDOM THINKING), EKAGRATA (NON-MEDITATIVE FOCUSING), DHARNA (FOCUSED MEDITATION), AND DHYANA (MEDITATION) AS DEFINED IN YOGA TEXTS. MEDITATION IS A SELF-REGULATED MENTAL PROCESS ASSOCIATED WITH DEEP RELAXATION AND INCREASED INTERNALIZED ATTENTION. SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATIONS ON MEDITATION REPORTED CHANGES IN ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNALS AND NEUROIMAGING MEASURES. BUT MOST OUTCOMES OF MEDITATION STUDIES SHOWED INCONSISTENT RESULTS, THIS MAY BE DUE TO HETEROGENEITY IN MEDITATION METHODS AND TECHNIQUES EVOLVED IN THE LAST 200 YEARS. TRADITIONALLY, THE FEATURES OF MEDITATION INCLUDE THE CAPACITY TO SUSTAIN A HEIGHTENED AWARENESS OF THOUGHTS, BEHAVIORS, EMOTIONS, AND PERCEPTIONS. GENERALLY, MEDITATION INVOLVES NON-REACTIVE EFFORTLESS MONITORING OF THE CONTENT OF EXPERIENCE FROM MOMENT TO MOMENT. FOCUSED MEDITATION PRACTICE INVOLVES AWARENESS ON A SINGLE OBJECT AND OPEN MONITORING MEDITATION IS A NON-DIRECTIVE MEDITATION INVOLVED ATTENTION IN BREATHING, MANTRA, OR SOUND. THEREFORE, RESULTS OF FEW EMPIRICAL STUDIES OF ADVANCED MEDITATORS OR BEGINNERS REMAIN TENTATIVE. THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO COMPILE THE MEDITATION-RELATED CHANGES IN ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL AND NEUROIMAGING PROCESSES AMONG EXPERIENCED AND NOVICE PRACTITIONERS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
10 2431 24 YOGA AND PHYSIOTHERAPY: A SPECULATIVE REVIEW AND CONCEPTUAL SYNTHESIS. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS THE POTENTIAL INTEGRATION OF YOGA AND PHYSIOTHERAPY WHEN CONSIDERING THE ESSENCE OF THEIR UNDERLYING CONCEPTS. WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARTICLE THE EXISTENCE OF SEVERAL SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THESE TWO 'CONCEPTS' HAS BEEN SUGGESTED. RESEARCHERS, PHYSIOTHERAPISTS AND THEIR PATIENTS AS WELL AS YOGA PRACTITIONERS CAN OBTAIN VALUABLE AND ADDITIONAL ARGUMENTS THROUGH THE CROSS-FERTILIZATION OF IDEAS ACROSS PRESENTED STUDIES UNITED BY SHARED, UNDERLYING CONCEPTS. THE PRACTICE OF YOGA IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS: COMPLEXITY AND MULTIDIMENSIONALITY, VARIOUS POSITIVE INFLUENCES ON AN INDIVIDUAL'S WHOLENESS THROUGH THE MIND, BODY, AND THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THEM. THESE ASSUMPTIONS MAY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS THE PRACTICE OF PHYSIOTHERAPY AND ITS UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES. THE ESSENCE OF PHYSIOTHERAPY AS A MULTIFACETED PROCESS REQUIRES TEAMWORK AND EFFORTS OF VARIOUS SPECIALISTS LIKE PSYCHOLOGISTS, SOCIOLOGISTS, OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS AND NURSES IF PATIENTS ARE TO BENEFIT. IDEALLY, THE PHYSIOTHERAPIST SHOULD POSSESS KNOWLEDGE FROM THESE AREAS OF SCIENCE IN ORDER TO PROFESSIONALLY CARE ABOUT PATIENTS. THEREFORE, IT CAN BE SUGGESTED THAT BASIC SIMILARITIES EXIST BETWEEN YOGA AND PHYSIOTHERAPY IN TERMS OF MUTIDISCIPLINARITY AND COMPLEXITY OF HOLISTIC CARE. SUCH CONCEPTUAL ENRICHMENT MAY BE A USEFUL SOURCE OF INSPIRATION FOR PHYSIOTHERAPISTS CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR PATIENTS' OVERALL HEALTH ON A DAILY BASIS. THE AUTHORS EMPHASIZE THE USEFULNESS OF YOGA PRACTICE IN CLINICAL UNITS AND EXPLAIN HOW THE ESSENCE OF AYURVEDIC KNOWLEDGE MIGHT BE EXTRAPOLATED AND INCORPORATED INTO THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES OF PHYSIOTHERAPY PROCESS. THE JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDIES INCLUDED IS ALSO PRESENTED.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
11 2420 15 YOGA AND MENTAL HEALTH: A DIALOGUE BETWEEN ANCIENT WISDOM AND MODERN PSYCHOLOGY. BACKGROUND: MANY YOGA TEXTS MAKE REFERENCE TO THE IMPORTANCE OF MENTAL HEALTH AND THE USE OF SPECIFIC TECHNIQUES IN THE TREATMENT OF MENTAL DISORDERS. DIFFERENT CONCEPTS UTILIZED IN MODERN PSYCHOLOGY MAY NOT COME WITH CONTEMPORARY IDEAS, INSTEAD, THEY SEEM TO SHARE A COMMON ROOT WITH ANCIENT WISDOM. AIMS: THE GOAL OF THIS PERSPECTIVE ARTICLE IS TO CORRELATE MODERN TECHNIQUES USED IN PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY WITH YOGIC PRACTICES, IN THE TREATMENT OF MENTAL DISORDERS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE CURRENT ARTICLE PRESENTED A DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE YOGIC APPROACH FOR THE TREATMENT OF MENTAL DISORDER AND CONCEPTS USED IN MODERN PSYCHOLOGY, SUCH AS META-COGNITION, DISIDENTIFICATION, DECONDITIONING AND INTEROCEPTIVE EXPOSURE. CONCLUSIONS: CONTEMPLATIVE RESEARCH FOUND OUT THAT MODERN INTERVENTIONS IN PSYCHOLOGY MIGHT NOT COME FROM MODERN CONCEPTS AFTER ALL, BUT SHARE GREAT SIMILARITY WITH ANCIENT YOGIC KNOWLEDGE, GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO INTEGRATE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WISDOM OF BOTH EAST AND WEST.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
12 2304 17 TOWARD AN EXPLANATORY FRAMEWORK FOR YOGA THERAPY INFORMED BY PHILOSOPHICAL AND ETHICAL PERSPECTIVES. CONTEXT * YOGA THERAPY IS AN EMERGING COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH PRACTICE FOR WHICH THERE IS INCREASING INTEREST FROM BOTH CLINICAL AND RESEARCH PERSPECTIVES. CURRENTLY MISSING, HOWEVER, IS AN EXPLANATORY FRAMEWORK FOR THE PROFESSION THAT PROVIDES PRACTITIONERS, CLIENTS, AND THE PUBLIC WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW VARIOUS YOGIC TRADITIONS AND PRINCIPLES CAN BE UNDERSTOOD IN MODERN HEALTH CARE CONTEXTS. OBJECTIVE * THIS STUDY PROPOSES AN EXPLANATORY FRAMEWORK FOR YOGA THERAPY, INFORMED BY PHENOMENOLOGY, EUDAIMONIA, VIRTUE ETHICS, AND FIRST-PERSON ETHICAL INQUIRY. CONCLUSIONS * THESE 4 PHILOSOPHICAL PERSPECTIVES-PHENOMENOLOGY, EUDAIMONIA, VIRTUE ETHICS, AND FIRST-PERSON ETHICAL INQUIRY-PROVIDE A LENS THROUGH WHICH TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOGIC PRACTICES SUPPORT THE INDIVIDUAL'S TRANSFORMATION IN THE EXPERIENCE OF ILLNESS, PAIN, OR DISABILITY. WE PROPOSE THAT THIS TRANSFORMATION OCCURS THROUGH FACILITATING A REHARMONIZATION OF BODY, MIND, AND ENVIRONMENT TOWARD THE EXPERIENCE OF EUDAIMONIC WELL-BEING.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
13 2373 18 WHAT IS OUR "EPISTEMIC RESPONSIBILITY"? REFLECTIONS ON SOCIAL WORK'S ORIENTATION IN YOGA THERAPY RESEARCH. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO EXPLORE HOW THE SOCIAL WORK DISCIPLINE COULD PROVIDE A COMPLEMENTARY LENS THROUGH WHICH YOGA THERAPY CAN BE ANALYZED AND EVALUATED BY ENGAGING IN KNOWLEDGE-CREATION PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES THAT PRIORITIZE THE "EPISTEMIC RESPONSIBILITY" DESCRIBED BY PHILOSOPHER LORRAINE CODE. MORE SPECIFICALLY, BY SEEKING TO STRATEGICALLY INCLUDE OFTEN-SUBJUGATED TYPES OF KNOWLEDGE AND BY FOCUSING ON REDISTRIBUTING EPISTEMIC POWER TO AGENTS THAT TYPICALLY HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM EPISTEMIC PARTICIPATION IN CONTEMPORARY YOGA THERAPY RESEARCH, THE SOCIAL WORK DISCIPLINE, WITH ITS STRONG COMMITMENT TO SOCIAL JUSTICE, HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CONTRIBUTE TO FILLING AN IMPORTANT GAP IN SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE. WE BEGIN BY PRESENTING THE RELEVANCE OF THE SOCIAL WORK PERSPECTIVE IN RELATION TO THE FIELD OF YOGA THERAPY. WE NEXT OFFER A RESERVED CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE DOMINANT TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE BASE THAT CURRENTLY INFORMS YOGA THERAPY PRACTICE. THIS ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHTS THE SOCIAL PARAMETERS THAT MAY BE RENDERED INVISIBLE OR LEFT ASIDE WHEN ADOPTING A POSITIVIST EPISTEMOLOGICAL LENS AND JUSTIFIES HOW THE CONCEPTUAL APPARATUS OF EPISTEMIC RESPONSIBILITY SERVES AS A POTENTIAL PLATFORM FOR RETHINKING SOCIAL WORK'S POSITION AND FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FIELD OF YOGA THERAPY. FINALLY, WE MOBILIZE THE CONCEPT OF CULTURAL APPROPRIATION TO ILLUSTRATE HOW STRIVING FOR EPISTEMIC RESPONSIBILITY PROVIDES AN ENTRY POINT FOR ADDRESSING THE MULTILEVEL, COMPLEX SOCIAL PROCESSES EMBEDDED IN YOGA THERAPY PRACTICE AND RESEARCH WHILE AIMING TO CAPTURE THE MANY VOICES-AND HENCE THE VARIOUS TRUTHS-IMPLICATED IN A DEMOCRATIC, REFLEXIVE, AND INCLUSIVE RESEARCH PROCESS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
14 2891 20 YOGA: THEORY AND PRACTICE-A COURSE THAT ILLUSTRATES WHY YOGA BELONGS IN THE ACADEMY. THE COURSE "YOGA: THEORY AND PRACTICE" (YTP) EVOLVED FROM THE REALIZATION THAT ALTHOUGH GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC YOGA COURSE OFFERINGS WERE FILLED BEYOND CAPACITY WITH WAITLISTS, STUDENTS WERE OFTEN NOT BEING EXPOSED TO THE DEPTH AND BREADTH OF YOGA AS A HOLISTIC, INTEGRATIVE HEALTH PRACTICE. IN THE AUTHORS' EXPERIENCE, STUDENTS EXPERIENTIALLY UNDERSTOOD THE CONTRIBUTION THAT YOGA PRACTICE MADE IN THEIR LIVES AND SENSED THE HEALTH BENEFITS IT AFFORDED, YET THEY WERE HUNGRY FOR THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE FOR USING YOGA TO ADDRESS VARIOUS CLINICAL CONDITIONS AND TO UNDERSTAND WHY YOGA FELT LIKE A GROUNDING PRACTICE. STUDENTS WANTED SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE FOR WHAT THEY EXPERIENTIALLY KNEW TO BE TRUE: YOGA HELPED THEM FEEL MORE GROUNDED IN THEIR BODIES. IN 2004, WHEN YTP WAS DESIGNED, COLLEGE YOGA COURSES WERE TYPICALLY IN DEPARTMENTS OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION, AND LITTLE TO NO ATTENTION WAS GIVEN TO THE THEORETICAL/PHILOSOPHICAL ROOTS BEHIND WHY YOGA IS PRACTICED. THIS IS NO LONGER THE CASE. YTP IS AN ELECTIVE WITHIN AN ACADEMIC MINOR OF STUDY, INTEGRATIVE APPROACHES TO HEALTH AND WELLNESS, AND THE COURSE OFFERS COLLEGE STUDENTS AN INDEPTH, ACADEMIC STUDY OF YOGA THAT INCORPORATES BOTH SCIENTIFIC (REDUCTIONIST) AND HOLISTIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVES. THE CLINICAL/EDUCATIONAL OBJECTIVE OF THIS COURSE IS TO EXPOSE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS (INCLUDING THOSE STUDYING TO BECOME HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS) TO THE EVIDENCE-BASED INTEGRATIVE HEALTH BENEFITS THAT YOGA AND YOGA THERAPY HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO PROVIDE. USING THE UNIVERSITY'S EDUCATIONAL SETTING PROVIDES A VENUE TO AUGMENT THE FUTURE USE OF YOGA IN HEALTHCARE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
15 2502 15 YOGA AS THERAPY IN PSYCHOSOMATIC MEDICINE. YOGA AS THERAPY WITH PSYCHOSOMATIC DISORDERS HAS BEEN PRACTICED FOR MANY CENTURIES IN INDIA, AND ONLY RECENTLY HAS BECOME UTILIZED FOR THIS PURPOSE IN OTHER COUNTRIES. THE YOGA SYSTEM EVOLVED AS A 'SYSTEM OF LIBERATION' TO ALLOW MAN TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN HIS EGO-SELF AND PURE CONSCIOUSNESS, AND AS SUCH, ITS MEDICAL BENEFITS ARE REALLY 'SIDE-EFFECTS'. INTEGRAL YOGA PRACTICE, HOWEVER, WITH WHICH MANY OTHER SELF-REGULATORY SOMATOPSYCHIC APPROACHES HAVE MUCH IN COMMON, CONSISTS OF A HOLISTIC TECHNOLOGY WHICH FUNCTIONS TO RESTORE OPTIMAL HOMEOSTATIS BY A VARIETY OF SPECIAL TECHNIQUES NOT FOUND IN OTHER APPROACHES. CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS OF PSYCHOSOMATIC PATIENTS INDICATE THAT THEIR DISTORTED SOMATOPSYCHIC FUNCTIONING NECESSITATES THEIR PRACTICE OF YOGA-LIKE THERAPY. A REVIEW OF THE CLINICAL EVIDENCE AVAILABLE INDICATES THAT YOGA PRACTICE HAS PROVEN MOST EFFECTIVE WITH A WIDE RANGE OF PSYCHOSOMATIC AND PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA CAN BE PARTIALLY UNDERSTOOD IN TERMS OF NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL THEORY.	1979	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
16 1335 20 HOW DOES YOGA PRACTICE AND THERAPY YIELD PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFITS? A REVIEW AND MODEL OF TRANSDIAGNOSTIC PROCESSES. INTEREST IN YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING HAS INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS, WITH LITERATURE INVESTIGATING BENEFICIAL EFFECTS IN A VARIETY OF PRESENTATIONS AND SETTINGS. THE THEORETICAL UNDERSTANDING OF THIS BENEFIT HAS PREVIOUSLY FOCUSED ON PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES INVOLVED IN YOGA PRACTICE, HOWEVER INTEREST HAS TURNED TO THE POTENTIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL MECHANISMS ELICITING PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING. THE CURRENT PAPER BUILDS ON PREVIOUS THEORY AND ARGUES THAT YOGA PRACTICE TARGETS TRANSDIAGNOSTIC PSYCHOLOGICAL PROCESSES; MECHANISMS THAT FEATURE COMMONLY ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF PRESENTATIONS, THUS REDUCING DISTRESS AND INCREASING WELLBEING ACROSS CLINICAL AND NON-CLINICAL POPULATIONS. FEATURES OF YOGA PRACTICE ARE DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO THESE TRANSDIAGNOSTIC PROCESSES AND THE FEATURES OF MODERN TALKING THERAPIES. A NEW MODEL IS PROPOSED POSITING SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF YOGA PRACTICE CORRELATE WITH SPECIFIC TRANSDIAGNOSTIC PROCESSES TO ELICIT PSYCHOLOGICAL CHANGE AND ARGUES THAT THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH CHANGE OCCURS ARE DIRECTLY COMPARED WITH THE CHANGES OBSERVED IN TALKING THERAPIES. THE IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH AND THE POTENTIAL FOR THIS TO SUPPORT THE COMMISSIONING OF HOLISTIC APPROACHES IN CLINICAL PRACTICE ARE DISCUSSED.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
17  373 21 AYURVEDA AND YOGA IN CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES. AYURVEDA IS DERIVED FROM 2 SANSKRIT WORDS, NAMELY, "AYUS" AND "VEDA," MEANING LIFE AND KNOWLEDGE, RESPECTIVELY. IT LITERALLY MEANS SCIENCE OF LIFE. AYURVEDA, OF WHICH YOGA IS AN INTEGRAL PART, IS WIDELY PRACTICED IN INDIA AND IS GAINING ACCEPTANCE IN MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. IT IS A COMPREHENSIVE AND A HOLISTIC SYSTEM, THE FOCUS OF WHICH IS ON THE BODY, MIND, AND CONSCIOUSNESS. THE AYURVEDIC TREATMENT CONSISTS OF THE USE HERBAL PREPARATIONS, DIET, YOGA, MEDITATION, AND OTHER PRACTICES. BASED ON THE REVIEW OF AVAILABLE STUDIES, THE EVIDENCE IS NOT CONVINCING THAT ANY AYURVEDIC HERBAL TREATMENT IS EFFECTIVE IN THE TREATMENT OF HEART DISEASE OR HYPERTENSION. HOWEVER, THE USE OF CERTAIN SPICES AND HERBS SUCH AS GARLIC AND TURMERIC IN AN OVERALL HEALTHY DIET IS APPROPRIATE. MANY HERBS USED BY AYURVEDIC PRACTITIONERS SHOW PROMISE AND COULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR LARGER RANDOMIZED TRIALS. YOGA, AN INTEGRAL PART OF AYURVEDA, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE USEFUL TO PATIENTS WITH HEART DISEASE AND HYPERTENSION. YOGA REDUCES ANXIETY, PROMOTES WELL-BEING, AND IMPROVES QUALITY OF LIFE. ITS SAFETY PROFILE IS EXCELLENT. ITS USE AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPEUTIC REGIMEN UNDER MEDICAL SUPERVISION IS APPROPRIATE AND COULD BE WORTH CONSIDERING.	2005	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
18 2211 19 THE HEALTH IMAGINARY OF POSTURAL YOGA. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE CAPACITY OF YOGA NARRATIVES AND PRACTICES TO CONTRIBUTE TO AND RELATE IDEAS ABOUT HEALTH. IT ADDS THEORETICALLY TO EXISTING LITERATURE ON YOGA BY INTRODUCING THE CONCEPT OF THE 'HEALTH IMAGINARY' AS AN ANALYTIC LENS FOR CONSIDERING YOGA DISCOURSES IN LATE MODERN TIMES, WHERE PERSONAL HEALTH CARE AND SPIRITUAL AMBITIONS ARE ONCE AGAIN BECOMING BLURRED. WITH THIS PERSPECTIVE, THE PAPER PROVIDES A THOROUGH ANALYSIS OF HOW YOGA POSTURES (ASANAS) ARE CONCEIVED TO WORK THERAPEUTICALLY, IN YOGA'S RECENT HISTORY AND IN PRESENT-DAY YOGA THERAPY. TAKING CASE STUDIES FROM INDIA AND GERMANY, IT IS SHOWN EMPIRICALLY HOW THE APPLICATION OF ASANAS IS RATIONALIZED DIFFERENTLY IN SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHICAL AND THERAPEUTIC ENVIRONMENTS - PARTICULARLY REGARDING THE PRESUMED THEORY OF THE BODY. THUS, THE CONCEPT OF THE HEALTH IMAGINARY NOT ONLY PROVIDES ANALYTIC SPACE TO EXPLORE THE IMPLICIT LOGICS AND GOALS OF HEALING IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS, BUT ALSO OFFERS CLUES ABOUT THE DISTINCT SOCIAL, CULTURAL/RELIGIOUS, AND LOCAL INFLUENCES THAT DRAW PEOPLE INTO YOGA AND CONTRIBUTE TO ITS SELECTIVE APPROPRIATION ACROSS THE GLOBE.	2021

1  539 121 COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN PARKINSON DISEASE: A REVIEW OF ACUPUNCTURE, TAI CHI, QI GONG, YOGA, AND CANNABIS. PARKINSON DISEASE (PD) IS A PROGRESSIVE NEURODEGENERATIVE CONDITION CHARACTERIZED BY BRADYKINESIA, RIGIDITY, RESTING TREMOR, AND POSTURAL INSTABILITY. NON-MOTOR SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING PAIN, FATIGUE, INSOMNIA, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION TO NAME A FEW, ARE INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED AND OFTEN JUST AS DISABLING AT MOTOR SYMPTOMS. THE MAINSTAY OF TREATMENT IS DOPAMINE REPLACEMENT; HOWEVER, THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS TEND TO WANE OVER TIME WITH DISEASE PROGRESSION, AND PATIENTS OFTEN EXPERIENCE MOTOR FLUCTUATIONS AND MEDICATION SIDE EFFECTS. THE LACK OF A DISEASE-MODIFYING INTERVENTION AND THE SHORTCOMINGS OF TRADITIONAL SYMPTOMATIC MEDICATIONS HAVE LED MANY PATIENTS TO PURSUE COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES TO ALLEVIATE MOTOR AND NON-MOTOR SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH PD. THE TERM COMPLEMENTARY IMPLIES THAT THE THERAPY IS USED ALONG WITH CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE AND MAY INCLUDE SUPPLEMENTS, MANIPULATIVE TREATMENTS (CHIROPRACTIC, MASSAGE), EXERCISE-BASED PROGRAMS, AND MIND-BODY PRACTICES. AS THESE PRACTICES BECOME MORE WIDESPREAD IN WESTERN MEDICINE, THERE IS A GROWING INTEREST IN EVALUATING THEIR EFFECTS ON A NUMBER OF MEDICAL CONDITIONS, PD INCLUDED. IN THIS REVIEW, WE PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON CLINICAL TRIALS THAT HAVE EVALUATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENTS FOR PATIENTS WITH PD, SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING ON ACUPUNCTURE, TAI CHI, QI GONG, YOGA, AND CANNABIS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
2  296  35 ALIGNING YOGA WITH ITS EVOLVING ROLE IN HEALTH CARE: COMMENTS ON YOGA PRACTICE, POLICY, RESEARCH. EVIDENCE IS ACCUMULATING THAT SUGGESTS THAT YOGA HAS BENEFICIAL EFFECTS IN MITIGATING THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN DISEASES. AS A RESULT, EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE TO MEDICALIZE YOGA AND USE IT WITHIN INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE AS A THERAPY. HOWEVER, THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL SHORTCOMINGS IN THE PRACTICE, POLICY, AND RESEARCH OF YOGA THAT UNDERMINE ITS OPTIMAL USE. YOGA AS A MODALITY FUNCTIONS WITHIN A CONTEXT. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO OCCASIONALLY STEP BACK AND EXAMINE THE ENTIRETY OF THE CONTEXT FROM A HIGH VANTAGE TO ASSESS WHETHER THE TACTICAL AND PROGRAMMATIC ENDEAVORS ARE ALIGNED WITH THE STRATEGIC INTENDED PURPOSE. THIS COMMENTARY DISCUSSES A FEW POLICY ISSUES RELEVANT TO SOME KEY STAKEHOLDERS. IT SUGGESTS THAT YOGA THERAPISTS NEED TO CALIBRATE THEIR MODEL OF YOGA BY REDUCING EMPHASIS ON POSTURES AND INCREASING IT ON MEDITATION AND BREATHING EXERCISES WHILE CATERING TO CLIENTS WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS. IT RECOMMENDS THAT YOGA RESEARCH SHOULD BE MORE CRITICAL IN EVALUATING YOGA'S FUNDAMENTAL TENETS AND USE REDUCTIONIST APPROACH TO DO SO. IT PROPOSES THAT AUTONOMOUS REGULATORS SHOULD EXTRICATE INJURY PRONE POSTURES FROM THE BODY OF YOGA PRACTICE FOR REGULATORY PURPOSES, RATHER THAN REGULATE YOGA SUMMARILY. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT PAYERS SHOULD PAY FOR YOGA. HOWEVER, THEY SHOULD USE PAYMENT MODEL AS IT IS USED FOR VACCINATION, INSTEAD OF PAYING AS IT IS DONE FOR PHYSIOTHERAPY. IT CONCLUDES THAT YOGA CAN HELP, BUT BEFORE IT CAN HELP IT NEEDS HELP ITSELF, AND THE VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS NEED TO REFLECT ON THE BIG PICTURE SO THAT THEY CAN COLLABORATE ON THESE IMPROVEMENTS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
3 1108  23 EFFECTS OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ON CANCER-ASSOCIATED COGNITIVE DECLINE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: TO SUMMARIZE AND EVALUATE EVIDENCE AVAILABLE ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CANCER-ASSOCIATED COGNITIVE DECLINE (CACD). RECENT FINDINGS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED USING FOUR DATABASES OF ARTICLES PUBLISHED BEFORE JANUARY 1, 2020. TEN ARTICLES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA (SIX RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS, TWO SINGLE-ARM STUDIES, ONE NON-RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, AND ONE CASE SERIES STUDY). STUDIES WERE PREDOMINANTLY CONDUCTED WITH BREAST CANCER PATIENTS USING LOW-INTENSITY HATHA YOGA PROGRAMS. OF THE 10 ARTICLES, FIVE REPORTED SOME POSITIVE EFFECTS ON CACD, BUT SIGNIFICANT BIASES WERE POSSIBLE DUE TO DESIGN SHORTCOMINGS. COHEN'S D EFFECT SIZES RANGED FROM |0.03| TO |0.74|. THE EVIDENCE TO DATE IS INSUFFICIENT TO SUGGEST THAT YOGA IS BENEFICIAL FOR ATTENUATING CACD. MORE RIGOROUS TRIALS CONTROLLING FOR NON-SPECIFIC FACTORS ARE WARRANTED. THE FIELD WOULD ALSO BENEFIT FROM EXAMINING SELF-DELIVERED MODES OF YOGA FOR TREATING CACD IN VARIOUS CANCER POPULATIONS TO ENHANCE PRACTICE SUSTAINABILITY AND GENERALIZABILITY.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
4  836  32 EFFECT OF YOGA ON PATIENTS WITH CANCER: OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERAPEUTIC YOGA IMPROVES THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF PATIENTS WITH CANCER. DATA SOURCES: SEARCH OF MEDLINE DATABASE (1950-2010) USING KEY WORDS YOGA, CANCER, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. STUDY SELECTION: PRIORITY WAS GIVEN TO RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL STUDIES CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON TYPICAL SYMPTOMS OF PATIENTS WITH CANCER IN NORTH AMERICA. SYNTHESIS: INITIALLY, 4 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL STUDIES WERE ANALYZED, THEN 2 STUDIES WITHOUT CONTROL GROUPS WERE ANALYZED. THREE STUDIES CONDUCTED IN INDIA AND THE NEAR EAST PROVIDED INTERESTING INFORMATION ON METHODOLOGIES. THE INTERVENTIONS INCLUDED YOGA SESSIONS OF VARYING LENGTH AND FREQUENCY. THE PARAMETERS MEASURED ALSO VARIED AMONG STUDIES. SEVERAL SYMPTOMS IMPROVED SUBSTANTIALLY WITH YOGA (HIGHER QUALITY OF SLEEP, DECREASE IN SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, IMPROVEMENT IN SPIRITUAL WELL-BEING, ETC). IT WOULD APPEAR THAT QUALITY OF LIFE, OR SOME ASPECTS THEREOF, ALSO IMPROVED. CONCLUSION: THE VARIETY OF BENEFITS DERIVED, THE ABSENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS, AND THE COST-BENEFIT RATIO OF THERAPEUTIC YOGA MAKE IT AN INTERESTING ALTERNATIVE FOR FAMILY PHYSICIANS TO SUGGEST TO THEIR PATIENTS WITH CANCER. CERTAIN METHODOLOGIC SHORTCOMINGS, INCLUDING THE LIMITED SIZE OF THE SAMPLES AND VARYING LEVELS OF ATTENDANCE ON THE PART OF THE SUBJECTS, MIGHT HAVE REDUCED THE STATISTICAL STRENGTH OF THE STUDIES PRESENTED. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE MEASUREMENT SCALES USED DID NOT SUIT THIS TYPE OF SITUATION AND PATIENT POPULATION, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT. HOWEVER, FAVOURABLE COMMENTS BY PARTICIPANTS DURING THE STUDIES AND THEIR LEVEL OF APPRECIATION AND WELL-BEING SUGGEST THAT FURTHER RESEARCH IS CALLED FOR TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS OF THESE EFFECTS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                         
5 2627  26 YOGA FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF CANCER TREATMENT-RELATED TOXICITIES. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: TO (1) EXPLAIN WHAT YOGA IS, (2) SUMMARIZE PUBLISHED LITERATURE ON THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR MANAGING CANCER TREATMENT-RELATED TOXICITIES, (3) PROVIDE CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE USE OF YOGA FOR ONCOLOGY PROFESSIONALS, AND (4) SUGGEST PROMISING AREAS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. RECENT FINDINGS: BASED ON A TOTAL OF 24 PHASE II AND ONE PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS, LOW-INTENSITY FORMS OF YOGA, SPECIFICALLY GENTLE HATHA AND RESTORATIVE, ARE FEASIBLE, SAFE, AND EFFECTIVE FOR TREATING SLEEP DISRUPTION, CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, PSYCHOSOCIAL DISTRESS, AND MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS IN CANCER PATIENTS RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIATION AND CANCER SURVIVORS. CLINICIANS SHOULD CONSIDER PRESCRIBING YOGA FOR THEIR PATIENTS SUFFERING WITH THESE TOXICITIES BY REFERRING THEM TO QUALIFIED YOGA PROFESSIONALS. MORE DEFINITIVE PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE FINDINGS AND TO INVESTIGATE OTHER TYPES, DOSES, AND DELIVERY MODES OF YOGA FOR TREATING CANCER-RELATED TOXICITIES IN PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
6  576  34 DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY DISORDERS: BENEFITS OF EXERCISE, YOGA, AND MEDITATION. MANY PEOPLE WITH DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY TURN TO NONPHARMACOLOGIC AND NONCONVENTIONAL INTERVENTIONS, INCLUDING EXERCISE, YOGA, MEDITATION, TAI CHI, OR QI GONG. META-ANALYSES AND SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS HAVE SHOWN THAT THESE INTERVENTIONS CAN IMPROVE SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY DISORDERS. AS AN ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT, EXERCISE SEEMS MOST HELPFUL FOR TREATMENT-RESISTANT DEPRESSION, UNIPOLAR DEPRESSION, AND POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. YOGA AS MONOTHERAPY OR ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY SHOWS POSITIVE EFFECTS, PARTICULARLY FOR DEPRESSION. AS AN ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY, IT FACILITATES TREATMENT OF ANXIETY DISORDERS, PARTICULARLY PANIC DISORDER. TAI CHI AND QI GONG MAY BE HELPFUL AS ADJUNCTIVE THERAPIES FOR DEPRESSION, BUT EFFECTS ARE INCONSISTENT. AS MONOTHERAPY OR AN ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY, MINDFULNESS-BASED MEDITATION HAS POSITIVE EFFECTS ON DEPRESSION, AND ITS EFFECTS CAN LAST FOR SIX MONTHS OR MORE. ALTHOUGH POSITIVE FINDINGS ARE LESS COMMON IN PEOPLE WITH ANXIETY DISORDERS, THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS ADJUNCTIVE USE. THERE ARE NO APPARENT NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS, AND THEIR GENERAL HEALTH BENEFITS JUSTIFY THEIR USE AS ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY DISORDERS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
7 2503  26 YOGA AS TREATMENT FOR INSOMNIA AMONG CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. MANY CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS, BETWEEN 15 TO 90%, REPORT SOME FORM OF INSOMNIA OR SLEEP QUALITY IMPAIRMENT DURING AND POST-TREATMENT, SUCH AS EXCESSIVE DAYTIME NAPPING, DIFFICULTY FALLING ASLEEP, DIFFICULTY STAYING ASLEEP, AND WAKING UP TOO EARLY. INSOMNIA AND SLEEP QUALITY IMPAIRMENT ARE AMONG THE MOST PREVALENT AND DISTRESSING PROBLEMS REPORTED BY CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS, AND CAN BE SEVERE ENOUGH TO INCREASE CANCER MORTALITY. DESPITE THE UBIQUITY OF INSOMNIA AND SLEEP QUALITY IMPAIRMENT, THEY ARE UNDER-DIAGNOSED AND UNDER-TREATED IN CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS. WHEN SLEEP PROBLEMS ARE PRESENT, PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS ARE OFTEN HESITANT TO PRESCRIBE OR TAKE PHARMACEUTICALS FOR SLEEP PROBLEMS DUE TO POLY PHARMACY CONCERNS, AND COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR INSOMNIA CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT AND IMPRACTICAL FOR PATIENTS TO ADHERE TO THROUGHOUT THE CANCER EXPERIENCE. RESEARCH SUGGESTS YOGA IS A WELL-TOLERATED EXERCISE INTERVENTION WITH PROMISING EVIDENCE FOR ITS EFFICACY IN IMPROVING INSOMNIA AND SLEEP QUALITY IMPAIRMENT AMONG SURVIVORS. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF EXISTING CLINICAL RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR TREATING INSOMNIA AND SLEEP QUALITY IMPAIRMENT AMONG CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
8 1141  25 EFFICACY OF YOGA, TAI CHI AND QI GONG ON THE MAIN SYMPTOMS OF CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. INTRODUCTION: THE AIM OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS TO SUMMARIZE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA, QI GONG OR TAI CHI IN COPD PATIENTS. METHODS: STUDIES EVALUATING EFFECTS OF THE SELECTED COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES ON LUNG FUNCTION, DYSPNEA, QUALITY OF LIFE OR FUNCTIONAL EXERCISE CAPACITY IN COPD PATIENTS WERE IDENTIFIED AND REVIEWED FROM THREE DATABASES. RESULTS: EIGHTEEN STUDIES WERE INCLUDED. SIX STUDIES EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND THE OTHERS FOCUSED ON TAI CHI OR QI GONG SEPARATELY OR COMBINED. THE DURATION OF THE PROGRAMS RANGED FROM 6 WEEKS TO 6 MONTHS AND THE FREQUENCY FROM 2 TO 7 TIMES A WEEK. EACH SESSION REACHED 30 TO 90 MINUTES. BENEFITS WERE OBSERVED ON LUNG FUNCTION AND FUNCTIONAL EXERCISE CAPACITY BUT BENEFIT WAS CLEARLY STATED NEITHER ON QUALITY OF LIFE NOR ON DYSPNEA. CONCLUSION: THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW HIGHLIGHTS THE POTENTIAL OF THESE THERAPIES AS COMPLEMENTARY THERAPEUTIC APPROACH IN COPD PATIENTS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
9 2440  30 YOGA AND QUALITY-OF-LIFE IMPROVEMENT IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER: A LITERATURE REVIEW. OBJECTIVE: WOMEN UNDERGOING TREATMENT FOR BREAST CANCER OFTEN TURN TO COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE (CAM), INCLUDING YOGA, FOR IMPROVEMENT OF MOOD, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), SLEEP, AND TREATMENT-RELATED SIDE EFFECTS. THE EXTANT LITERATURE WAS REVIEWED TO EXAMINE THE CLINICAL EFFECTS OF YOGA PRACTICE ON QOL FOR PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. QOL WAS DEFINED AS PHYSICAL WELL-BEING, SOCIAL FUNCTIONING, EMOTIONAL HEALTH, AND FUNCTION-AL ADAPTATION. METHODS: SEVEN DATABASES, INCLUDING PUBMED, OVID MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PSYCINFO, COCHRANE LIBRARY, AND WEB OF SCIENCE WERE USED TO SEARCH FOR STUDIES OF PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER THAT INCLUDED A YOGA INTERVENTION AND QOL ASSESSMENT. ATTENTION WAS PAID TO ASSESSING STUDY POPULATION, OUTCOME VARIABLES, THE TYPE OF YOGA INTERVENTION USED, AND METHODOLOGICAL STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS. RESULTS: SEVENTY-ONE ARTICLES WERE IDENTIFIED THAT FIT THE SEARCH CRITERIA. ALTHOUGH THE LITERATURE PROVIDED EVIDENCE OF QOL BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER, NO SPECIFIC ASPECT OF YOGA WAS IDENTIFIED AS BEING MOST ADVANTAGEOUS. CONCLUSION: ALTHOUGH PARTICIPATION IN YOGA PROGRAMS APPEARED TO BENEFIT PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER, GREATER METHODOLOGICAL RIGOR IS REQUIRED TO UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR EFFECTIVENESS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
10 2023  36 SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF YOGA FOR SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT DURING CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. INTRODUCTION: BREAST CANCER IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY DIAGNOSED CANCERS IN WOMEN IN THE US, AND ITS TREATMENTS HAVE SIGNIFICANT PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SIDE EFFECTS AND LONG-TERM COMPLICATIONS CAUSING SIGNIFICANT MORBIDITY AND DECREASED QUALITY OF LIFE. INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE MODALITIES, SUCH AS YOGA, HAVE BEEN FOUND TO REDUCE SIDE EFFECTS OF CONVENTIONAL TREATMENTS WITHOUT INTERFERING WITH THE TREATMENT ITSELF AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE. IN THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW, WE SPECIFICALLY EXPLORED YOGA AS A POTENTIAL OPTION FOR SYMPTOMATIC MANAGEMENT IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING CONVENTIONAL BREAST CANCER TREATMENTS. METHODS: WE PERFORMED A LITERATURE SEARCH THAT WAS CONDUCTED TO INCLUDE THE DATABASES PUBMED, PSYCHINFO, COCHRANE LIBRARY, SCOPUS, AND CINAHL, RESULTING IN 28 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) ARTICLES. WE REVIEW THE RESULTS OF THESE TRIALS REGARDING THE IMPACT OF YOGA IN THIS PATIENT POPULATION. RESULTS: OVERALL, THE MAJORITY OF THE RCT ARTICLES SHOWED SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS OF YOGA INTERVENTION IN VARIOUS ASPECTS OF QUALITY OF LIFE, FATIGUE, NAUSEA/VOMITING, SLEEP QUALITY, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND DISTRESS. THERE ARE SEVERAL STUDIES THAT HAVE EXPLORED THE PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISM BEHIND THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND FOUND THAT YOGA AFFECTS BOTH THE IMMUNE RESPONSE AND INFLAMMATION. DISCUSSION: THESE STUDIES REVEALED THAT YOGA HAS A POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC ROLE IN THE SYMPTOMATIC MANAGEMENT OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS, ENHANCING QUALITY OF LIFE DURING TREATMENT AS WELL AS IMPROVING ADHERENCE TO TREATMENT. FUTURE STUDIES WITH MORE DEFINED AND CONSISTENT METHODOLOGIES ARE NECESSARY TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL USE OF YOGA THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
11 1164  30 EVALUATING THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA-BASED PROGRAM INTEGRATED WITH THIRD-WAVE COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY COMPONENTS ON SELF-REGULATION IN CHILDREN ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM: A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. LAY ABSTRACT: CHILDREN ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM MAY EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTIES WITH THE REGULATION OF ATTENTION, THOUGHTS, EMOTIONS, AND BEHAVIOR, UNDERSTANDING, AND EXPRESSING THEIR EMOTIONS APPROPRIATELY, AS WELL AS ANXIETY, AND SLEEP. IN AUTISM RESEARCH, CONTEMPLATIVE PRACTICES THAT WORK THROUGH BOTH BODY AND MIND HAVE SHOWN TENTATIVELY PROMISING RESULTS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE LIMITED STUDIES ON THIS TOPIC, AND THE USE OF YOGA TO FACILITATE EXECUTIVE CONTROL HAS NOT BEEN RESEARCHED YET. THE INCREDIBLE EXPLORERS (6-WEEK PROGRAM), A YOGA-INFORMED INTERVENTION PROGRAM FOR CHILDREN (8-12 YEARS), WAS DEVELOPED TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER, FOR CHILDREN ON THE AUTISM SPECTRUM, THE TRAINING COULD IMPROVE THE ABILITY TO SELF-REGULATE, REDUCE ANXIETY AND SLEEP PROBLEMS, AND INCREASE AWARENESS OF EMOTIONS. IN OUR SAMPLE, 61 CHILDREN WITH ONE OF THEIR PARENTS COMPLETED THE PROGRAM. HALF OF THE GROUP RECEIVED THE INTERVENTION, AND THE OTHER HALF HAD TO WAIT UNTIL THE YOGA GROUP COMPLETED THEIR TRIAL. THE PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO GIVE THEIR FEEDBACK IMMEDIATELY AFTER PROGRAM COMPLETION AND AT 6-WEEK FOLLOW-UP. COMPARED TO THE GROUP THAT WAS WAITING TO RECEIVE THE INTERVENTION, PARENTS IN THE YOGA GROUP REPORTED SIGNIFICANT GAINS FOR THEIR CHILDREN IN REGULATING THEIR OVERALL EXECUTIVE CONTROL IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SESSION AND AGAIN AT FOLLOW-UP. THE PARENTS REPORTED A REDUCTION IN SOME OF THE SLEEP PROBLEMS POST-TREATMENT. CHILDREN INDICATED AN IMPROVED ABILITY TO COMMUNICATE THEIR FEELINGS AND WILLINGNESS TO ANALYZE THEIR EMOTIONS POST-INTERVENTION. HOWEVER, THE STUDY HAD SEVERAL SHORTCOMINGS AND GIVEN THAT THIS WAS THE FIRST TRIAL OF THE PROGRAM, THE RESULTS NEED TO BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION. FURTHER RESEARCH IS RECOMMENDED.	2021	
                                                                                                     
12 2311  20 TRANSLATING KNOWLEDGE: A FRAMEWORK FOR EVIDENCE-INFORMED YOGA PROGRAMS IN ONCOLOGY. EMPIRICAL RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT YOGA MAY POSITIVELY INFLUENCE THE NEGATIVE PSYCHOSOCIAL AND PHYSICAL SIDE EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH CANCER AND ITS TREATMENT. THE TRANSLATION OF THESE FINDINGS INTO SUSTAINABLE, EVIDENCE-INFORMED YOGA PROGRAMMING FOR CANCER SURVIVORS HAS LAGGED BEHIND THE RESEARCH. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES (A) AN OVERVIEW OF THE YOGA AND CANCER RESEARCH, (B) A FRAMEWORK FOR SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPING AND DELIVERING YOGA TO CANCER POPULATIONS, AND (C) AN EXAMPLE OF A SUCCESSFUL COMMUNITY-BASED PROGRAM. THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTINUED RESEARCH AND KNOWLEDGE TRANSLATION EFFORTS IN THE CONTEXT OF YOGA AND INTEGRATIVE ONCOLOGY ARE HIGHLIGHTED.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
13 2129  28 THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA ON CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION: THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA ON CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (CRF) IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY AND/OR RADIATION THERAPY. LITERATURE SEARCH: RELEVANT ENGLISH AND CHINESE ARTICLES WERE RETRIEVED FROM MEDICAL DATABASES AND INCLUDED IN THIS ANALYSIS. STANDARDIZED CRITICAL APPRAISAL INSTRUMENTS FROM THE JOANNA BRIGGS INSTITUTE WERE ADOPTED FOR THE QUALITY ASSESSMENT. DATA EVALUATION: 16 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. SYNTHESIS: YOGA INTERVENTIONS HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT IN REDUCING CRF AMONG PATIENTS UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY AND/OR RADIATION THERAPY, BUT THE ADHERENCE TO YOGA WAS LOW. MIXED TYPES OF YOGA, IN ADDITION TO SUPERVISED AND SELF-PRACTICING STRATEGIES, WERE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED PATIENT ADHERENCE AND IMPROVED CRF. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: YOGA APPEARS TO BE A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE EXERCISE FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF CRF DURING CHEMOTHERAPY AND/OR RADIATION THERAPY; HOWEVER, ADDITIONAL HIGH-QUALITY STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO DEFINE AN OPTIMAL YOGA INTERVENTION STRATEGY.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
14 1907  28 REVIEW OF YOGA THERAPY DURING CANCER TREATMENT. PURPOSE: REVIEWS OF YOGA RESEARCH THAT DISTINGUISH RESULTS OF TRIALS CONDUCTED DURING (VERSUS AFTER) CANCER TREATMENT ARE NEEDED TO GUIDE FUTURE RESEARCH AND CLINICAL PRACTICE. WE THEREFORE CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF NON-RANDOMIZED STUDIES AND RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS UNDERGOING TREATMENT FOR ANY CANCER TYPE. METHODS: STUDIES WERE IDENTIFIED VIA RESEARCH DATABASES AND REFERENCE LISTS. INCLUSION CRITERIA WERE THE FOLLOWING: (1) CHILDREN OR ADULTS UNDERGOING CANCER TREATMENT, (2) INTERVENTION STATED AS YOGA OR COMPONENT OF YOGA, AND (3) PUBLICATION IN ENGLISH IN PEER-REVIEWED JOURNALS THROUGH OCTOBER 2015. EXCLUSION CRITERIA WERE THE FOLLOWING: (1) SAMPLES RECEIVING HORMONE THERAPY ONLY, (2) INTERVENTIONS INVOLVING MEDITATION ONLY, AND (3) YOGA DELIVERED WITHIN BROADER CANCER RECOVERY OR MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION PROGRAMS. RESULTS: RESULTS OF NON-RANDOMIZED (ADULT N = 8, PEDIATRIC N = 4) AND RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (ADULT N = 13, PEDIATRIC N = 0) CONDUCTED DURING CANCER TREATMENT ARE SUMMARIZED SEPARATELY BY AGE GROUP. FINDINGS MOST CONSISTENTLY SUPPORT IMPROVEMENT IN PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES (E.G., DEPRESSION, DISTRESS, ANXIETY). SEVERAL STUDIES ALSO FOUND THAT YOGA ENHANCED QUALITY OF LIFE, THOUGH FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS NEEDED TO CLARIFY DOMAIN-SPECIFIC EFFICACY (E.G., PHYSICAL, SOCIAL, CANCER-SPECIFIC). REGARDING PHYSICAL AND BIOMEDICAL OUTCOMES, EVIDENCE INCREASINGLY SUGGESTS THAT YOGA AMELIORATES SLEEP AND FATIGUE; ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO ADVANCE PRELIMINARY FINDINGS FOR OTHER TREATMENT SEQUELAE AND STRESS/IMMUNITY BIOMARKERS. CONCLUSIONS: AMONG ADULTS UNDERGOING CANCER TREATMENT, EVIDENCE SUPPORTS RECOMMENDING YOGA FOR IMPROVING PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES, WITH POTENTIAL FOR ALSO IMPROVING PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS. EVIDENCE IS INSUFFICIENT TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY. WE DESCRIBE SUGGESTIONS FOR STRENGTHENING YOGA RESEARCH METHODOLOGY TO INFORM CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES.	2017	

15 2631  22 YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF INSOMNIA AMONG CANCER PATIENTS: EVIDENCE, MECHANISMS OF ACTION, AND CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS. UP TO 90% OF CANCER PATIENTS REPORT SYMPTOMS OF INSOMNIA DURING AND AFTER TREATMENT. SYMPTOMS OF INSOMNIA INCLUDE EXCESSIVE DAYTIME SLEEPINESS, DIFFICULTY FALLING ASLEEP, DIFFICULTY STAYING ASLEEP, AND WAKING UP TOO EARLY. INSOMNIA SYMPTOMS ARE AMONG THE MOST PREVALENT, DISTRESSING AND PERSISTENT CANCER- AND CANCER TREATMENT-RELATED TOXICITIES REPORTED BY PATIENTS, AND CAN BE SEVERE ENOUGH TO INCREASE CANCER MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. DESPITE THE UBIQUITY OF INSOMNIA SYMPTOMS, THEY ARE UNDER-SCREENED, UNDER-DIAGNOSED, AND UNDER-TREATED IN CANCER PATIENTS. WHEN INSOMNIA SYMPTOMS ARE IDENTIFIED, PROVIDERS ARE HESITANT TO PRESCRIBE, AND PATIENTS ARE HESITANT TO TAKE PHARMACEUTICALS DUE TO POLYPHARMACY CONCERNS. IN ADDITION, SLEEP MEDICATIONS DO NOT CURE INSOMNIA. YOGA IS A WELL-TOLERATED MODE OF EXERCISE WITH PROMISING EVIDENCE FOR ITS EFFICACY IN IMPROVING INSOMNIA SYMPTOMS AMONG CANCER PATIENTS. THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS EXISTING CLINICAL RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR TREATING INSOMNIA AMONG CANCER PATIENTS. THE ARTICLE ALSO PROVIDES CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRESCRIBING YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF INSOMNIA IN THIS POPULATION.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
16 1856  39 RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW. PURPOSE: YOGA IS INCREASINGLY USED AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY TO MANAGE DISEASE AND TREATMENT-RELATED SIDE EFFECTS IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER AND HAS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF STUDIES EXPLORING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW EXAMINES WHETHER YOGA INTERVENTIONS PROVIDE ANY MEASURABLE BENEFIT, BOTH PHYSICALLY AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY, FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER. THE RESULTS WILL INFORM FUTURE RESEARCH IN THIS FIELD AND ADVANCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOGA PROGRAMMES. METHODS: WE PERFORMED ELECTRONIC SEARCHES OF MEDLINE, PSYCHINFO, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, WEB OF SCIENCE AND SCOPUS FOR ARTICLES PUBLISHED UP TO JUNE 2012. ONLY RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) WERE INCLUDED AND METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY RATING SCORES WERE DETERMINED USING THE PEDRO (PHYSIOTHERAPY EVIDENCE DATABASE) SCALE. RESULTS: ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-TWO STUDIES WERE IDENTIFIED THROUGH A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH OF EIGHT ELECTRONIC DATABASES. ONLY PUBLISHED MANUSCRIPTS THAT EMPLOYED A RCT DESIGN WERE INCLUDED (N = 18). THE SAMPLE SIZES FOR THESE STUDIES VARIED WIDELY FROM 18 TO 164 PARTICIPANTS AND THE ASSOCIATED PEDRO SCORES RANGED FROM 1 (POOR) TO 8 (GOOD). ALL 18 STUDIES REPORTED POSITIVE EFFECTS FOR TREATMENT-RELATED SIDE EFFECTS IN FAVOUR OF THE YOGA INTERVENTIONS, WITH THE GREATEST IMPACT ON GLOBAL QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) SCORES AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING. CONCLUSION: RESULTS FROM THE FEW RCTS SUGGEST THERE IS MODERATE TO GOOD EVIDENCE THAT YOGA MAY BE A USEFUL PRACTICE FOR WOMEN RECOVERING FROM BREAST CANCER TREATMENTS. LARGE-SCALE RCTS USING OBJECTIVE MEASURES AND PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES WITH LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP ARE NEEDED TO SUBSTANTIATE WHETHER THE BENEFITS ARE TRUE AND SUSTAINABLE.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                         
17 2623  28 YOGA FOR SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT IN ONCOLOGY: A REVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE BASE AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS FOR RESEARCH. BECAUSE YOGA IS INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED AS A COMPLEMENTARY APPROACH TO CANCER SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT, PATIENTS/SURVIVORS AND PROVIDERS NEED TO UNDERSTAND ITS POTENTIAL BENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS BOTH DURING AND AFTER TREATMENT. THE AUTHORS REVIEWED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) OF YOGA CONDUCTED AT THESE POINTS IN THE CANCER CONTINUUM (N = 29; N = 13 DURING TREATMENT, N = 12 POST-TREATMENT, AND N = 4 WITH MIXED SAMPLES). FINDINGS BOTH DURING AND AFTER TREATMENT DEMONSTRATED THE EFFICACY OF YOGA TO IMPROVE OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), WITH IMPROVEMENT IN SUBDOMAINS OF QOL VARYING ACROSS STUDIES. FATIGUE WAS THE MOST COMMONLY MEASURED OUTCOME, AND MOST RCTS CONDUCTED DURING OR AFTER CANCER TREATMENT REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN FATIGUE. RESULTS ALSO SUGGESTED THAT YOGA CAN IMPROVE STRESS/DISTRESS DURING TREATMENT AND POST-TREATMENT DISTURBANCES IN SLEEP AND COGNITION. SEVERAL RCTS PROVIDED EVIDENCE THAT YOGA MAY IMPROVE BIOMARKERS OF STRESS, INFLAMMATION, AND IMMUNE FUNCTION. OUTCOMES WITH LIMITED OR MIXED FINDINGS (EG, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, PAIN, CANCER-SPECIFIC SYMPTOMS, SUCH AS LYMPHEDEMA) AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES (SUCH AS BENEFIT-FINDING AND LIFE SATISFACTION) WARRANT FURTHER STUDY. IMPORTANT FUTURE DIRECTIONS FOR YOGA RESEARCH IN ONCOLOGY INCLUDE: ENROLLING PARTICIPANTS WITH CANCER TYPES OTHER THAN BREAST, STANDARDIZING SELF-REPORT ASSESSMENTS, INCREASING THE USE OF ACTIVE CONTROL GROUPS AND OBJECTIVE MEASURES, AND ADDRESSING THE HETEROGENEITY OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS, WHICH VARY IN TYPE, KEY COMPONENTS (MOVEMENT, MEDITATION, BREATHING), DOSE, AND DELIVERY MODE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
18 1300  34 HATHA YOGA FOR DEPRESSION: CRITICAL REVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE FOR EFFICACY, PLAUSIBLE MECHANISMS OF ACTION, AND DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. BACKGROUND: THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO REVIEW THE EVIDENCE FOR THE EFFICACY OF HATHA YOGA FOR DEPRESSION AND POSSIBLE MECHANISMS BY WHICH YOGA MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON DEPRESSION, AND TO OUTLINE DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. METHODS: LITERATURE REVIEW AND SYNTHESIS. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A LITERATURE SEARCH FOR CLINICAL TRIALS EXAMINING YOGA FOR DEPRESSION UNCOVERED EIGHT TRIALS: 5 INCLUDING INDIVIDUALS WITH CLINICAL DEPRESSION, AND 3 FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH ELEVATED DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS. ALTHOUGH RESULTS FROM THESE TRIALS ARE ENCOURAGING, THEY SHOULD BE VIEWED AS VERY PRELIMINARY BECAUSE THE TRIALS, AS A GROUP, SUFFERED FROM SUBSTANTIAL METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS. WE WOULD ARGUE, HOWEVER, THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS TO CONSIDER CONSTRUCTING CAREFUL RESEARCH ON YOGA FOR DEPRESSION. FIRST, CURRENT STRATEGIES FOR TREATING DEPRESSION ARE NOT SUFFICIENT FOR MANY INDIVIDUALS, AND PATIENTS HAVE SEVERAL CONCERNS ABOUT EXISTING TREATMENTS. YOGA MAY BE AN ATTRACTIVE ALTERNATIVE TO OR A GOOD WAY TO AUGMENT CURRENT DEPRESSION TREATMENT STRATEGIES. SECOND, ASPECTS OF YOGA-INCLUDING MINDFULNESS PROMOTION AND EXERCISE-ARE THOUGHT TO BE "ACTIVE INGREDIENTS" OF OTHER SUCCESSFUL TREATMENTS FOR DEPRESSION. THIRD, THERE ARE PLAUSIBLE BIOLOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND BEHAVIORAL MECHANISMS BY WHICH YOGA MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON DEPRESSION. WE PROVIDE SUGGESTIONS FOR THE NEXT STEPS IN THE STUDY OF YOGA AS A TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
19 2354  31 UTILIZING YOGA IN ONCOLOGIC PATIENTS TREATED WITH RADIOTHERAPY: REVIEW. PURPOSE: SEVERAL TRIALS ON NONCANCER POPULATION INDICATE THAT YOGA IS ASSOCIATED WITH MEANINGFUL CLINICAL EFFECTS. THIS STUDY EVALUATED THE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES OF YOGA IN ONCOLOGIC PATIENTS TREATED WITH RADIOTHERAPY. METHODS: WE FOCUSED ON A RESEARCH THROUGH COCHRANE REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL), BIOMED CENTRAL, AND MEDLINE STUDIES UP TO MAY 2017. RESULTS: YOGA WAS FOUND TO HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL BENEFIT IN CANCER PATIENTS' DISTRESS, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION. IT ALSO DEMONSTRATED A MODERATE IMPACT ON FATIGUE AND EMOTIONAL FUNCTION AND A SMALL AND INSIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON FUNCTIONAL WELL-BEING AND SLEEP DISTURBANCES. AS FAR AS THE EFFECTS ON PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES ARE CONCERNED, THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE. CONCLUSIONS: THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS SHOWED THAT YOGA HAS STRONG BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON ONCOLOGIC PATIENTS' QUALITY OF LIFE. RESULTS OF THE CURRENT REVIEW MUST BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION DUE TO THE RELATIVE SMALL SAMPLE SIZES OF MOST OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES, WHILE A PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED STUDY STANDS IN NEED FOR THE CONFIRMATION OF OUR RESULTS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
20 2548  27 YOGA FOR CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS. BACKGROUND: YOGA HAS BEEN PRACTICED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING. EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON YOGA HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR SEVERAL DECADES, INCLUDING SEVERAL RECENT STUDIES CONDUCTED WITH CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS. METHODS: THIS REVIEW PROVIDES A GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO YOGA AND A DETAILED REVIEW OF YOGA RESEARCH IN CANCER. RESULTS: NINE STUDIES CONDUCTED WITH CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS YIELDED MODEST IMPROVEMENTS IN SLEEP QUALITY, MOOD, STRESS, CANCER-RELATED DISTRESS, CANCER-RELATED SYMPTOMS, AND OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE. STUDIES CONDUCTED IN OTHER PATIENT POPULATIONS AND HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS HAVE SHOWN BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOMATIC SYMPTOMS, AS WELL AS OTHER ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL FUNCTION. CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS FROM THE EMERGING LITERATURE ON YOGA AND CANCER PROVIDE PRELIMINARY SUPPORT FOR THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFICACY OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR CANCER PATIENTS, ALTHOUGH CONTROLLED TRIALS ARE LACKING. FURTHER RESEARCH IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE RELIABILITY OF THESE EFFECTS AND TO IDENTIFY THEIR UNDERLYING MECHANISMS.	2005

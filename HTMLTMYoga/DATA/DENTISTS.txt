1 1921 109 ROLE OF YOGA AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN WORK-RELATED MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS AMONG DENTISTS. BACKGROUND: WORK-RELATED MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN IS ONE OF THE OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS IN DENTISTS. AIMS: TO FIND THE PREVALENCE AND SEVERITY OF MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN IN DENTISTS, TO COMPARE MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN AMONG DENTISTS PRACTICING YOGA, THOSE PRACTICING PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES, AND THOSE WITHOUT ANY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND ALSO TO KNOW THE EFFECTS OF SEX, AGE, AND WORKLOAD ON MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A SELF-REPORTING WORK-RELATED QUESTIONNAIRE AND THE NORDIC QUESTIONNAIRE FOR ANALYSIS OF MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS WERE GIVEN TO GRADUATED DENTISTS ATTENDING INDIAN DENTAL CONFERENCE IN MUMBAI, TO KNOW THE MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN EXPERIENCED IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS AND FEEDBACK WAS OBTAINED FROM 220 DENTISTS. RESULTS: THE PREVALENCE OF MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN IN DENTISTS WAS 34.5%. PREVALENCE OF MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN WAS 10.5%, 21.7%, AND 45.6% IN DENTISTS WITH REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE, OTHER PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND NO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, RESPECTIVELY. THERE WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE PREVALENCE OF MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN AMONG DENTISTS WHO WERE PRACTICING YOGA WHEN COMPARED WITH THOSE IN NO REGULAR ACTIVITY GROUP. CONCLUSION: WITHIN THE LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY, THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT ROLE OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ON THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF WORK-RELATED MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS EXPERIENCED BY DENTISTS. YOGA WAS FOUND TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN OTHER MODES OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES. MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED ON MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS IN DENTISTS, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON LARGER SAMPLE SIZES AND CORRELATING OTHER FACTORS LIKE AGE AND SEX OF THE DENTISTS, DURATION OF PRACTICE, YEARS OF PRACTICING YOGA, AND WORKING HOURS PER WEEK.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
2 2017  33 SURVEY ON UTILITY OF YOGA AS AN ALTERNATIVE THERAPY FOR OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS AMONG DENTAL PRACTIONERS. BACKGROUND: THE THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL OF YOGA ARE OFTEN CONSIDERED COMPLEMENTARY TO VARIOUS FORMS OF MEDICAL PRACTICE. VERY FEW STUDIES HAVE EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN THE TREATMENT OF OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS AMONG DENTISTS. HENCE, THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE THE ADOPTION OF YOGA TECHINQUES AS AN ALTERNATIVE THERAPY IN TREATMENT OF PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS AMONG DENTAL GENERAL PRACTITIONERS IN CHENNAI, INDIA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A VALIDATED CLOSED-ENDED QUESTIONNAIRE WAS CIRCULATED TO 500 DENTAL GENERAL PRACTITIONERS IN CHENNAI, INDIA AND WE RECEIVED 394 COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES. THE QUESTIONNAIRE DOCUMENTED DEMOGRAPHIC DATA, OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS AND THE TYPE OF TREATMENT TAKEN FOR THE HAZARDS. RESULTS: MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN WITH STRESS (47%) WAS THE MOST COMMON OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD REPORTED, FOLLOWED BY ONLY STRESS (27.4%), AND ONLY MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN (25.6%). ONLY 9.6% OF PRACTITIONERS ADOPTED YOGA AS AN ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT FOR THESE OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS. INTERESTINGLY, MAJORITY (46.4%) OF THEM DID EXERCISE, GYM, MASSAGE, WALKING AND HEARD MUSIC. SURPRISINGLY, 43.9% DID NOT TAKE ANY MEASURES TO TREAT THESE OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS. HOWEVER 53.3% OF THE DENTISTS WHO DID NOT CONSIDER YOGA AS AN ALTERNATIVE THERAPY, STATED LACK OF TIME AS A REASON FOR NOT PRACTICING YOGA WHILE 17.6% OF THEM DON'T BELIEVE YOGA AS A THERAPY. CONCLUSION: DESPITE MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN AND STRESS BEING THE MOST COMMON OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD PREVALENT AMONG DENTISTS, OVER 50% OF THE SUBJECTS SURVEYED DIDN'T SEEK ANY MEASURE TO TREAT THESE OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS AND ONLY 10% OF THEM PRACTICED YOGA AS THE ALTERNATIVE THERAPY.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
3 2261  30 THE PRECEDENCE AND VIABILITY OF YOGA IN THE LIVES OF D3-DENTAL STUDENTS, DENTAL PRACTITIONERS, AND DENTAL PATIENTS. DENTISTRY AS A PROFESSION IS QUITE DEMANDING AND CHALLENGING AND IS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS LIKE MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS AND STRESS-RELATED PROBLEMS. THE PRACTICE OF YOGA HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE EFFICACIOUS IN MANAGEMENT OF QUITE A LOT OF STRESS AND LIFESTYLE DISORDERS. IT STRENGTHENS ONE PHYSICALLY, MENTALLY, AND EMOTIONALLY. MOREOVER, YOGA CAN ALSO BE USED IN THE MANAGEMENT OF DENTAL PATIENTS FOR STRESS-RELATED ORAL CONDITIONS LIKE LICHEN PLANUS, BURNING MOUTH SYNDROME, APHTHOUS ULCERS, ETC., YOGA HAS ALSO BEEN FOUND TO HAVE ANTIINFLAMMATORY, ANTIANXIETY EFFECT, AND ALSO A LOT OF OTHER BENEFICIAL EFFECTS. THIS REVIEW EMPHASIZES ON THE RELEVANCE OF YOGA IN THE DENTAL PROFESSION, FROM THE PRACTITIONERS, STUDENTS, AND PATIENTS VIEWPOINT. DATA PERTAINING TO THE SUBJECT WAS OBTAINED AFTER A THOROUGH SEARCH OF THE PUBMED LITERATURE AND GOOGLE SEARCH ENGINE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
4 1562  37 LONGITUDINAL AND IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF KUNDALINI YOGA ON SALIVARY LEVELS OF CORTISOL AND ACTIVITY OF ALPHA-AMYLASE AND ITS EFFECT ON PERCEIVED STRESS. CONTEXT: STRESS IS DEFINED AS AN ALTERATION OF AN ORGANISM'S BALANCE IN RESPONSE TO A DEMAND PERCEIVED FROM THE ENVIRONMENT. DIVERSE METHODS EXIST TO EVALUATE PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE. A NONINVASIVE METHOD IS SALIVARY MEASUREMENT OF CORTISOL AND ALPHA-AMYLASE. A GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE REGULAR PRACTICE OF YOGA WOULD BE AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR STRESS. AIMS: TO DETERMINE THE KUNDALINI YOGA (KY) EFFECT, IMMEDIATE AND AFTER 3 MONTHS OF REGULAR PRACTICE, ON THE PERCEPTION OF PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS AND THE SALIVARY LEVELS OF CORTISOL AND ALPHA-AMYLASE ACTIVITY. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: TO DETERMINE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PERCEIVED STRESS, LEVELS OF CORTISOL AND ALPHA-AMYLASE ACTIVITY IN SALIVA, AND COMPARE BETWEEN THE PARTICIPANTS TO KY CLASSES PERFORMED FOR 3 MONTHS AND A GROUP THAT DOES NOT PRACTICE ANY TYPE OF YOGA. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: THE TOTAL SAMPLE CONSISTED OF 26 PEOPLE BETWEEN 18 AND 45-YEAR-OLD; 13 TAKING PART IN KY CLASSES GIVEN AT THE FACULTY OF DENTISTRY, UNIVERSITY OF CHILE AND 13 CONTROLS. SALIVARY SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED, ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY WAS PERFORMED TO QUANTIFY CORTISOL AND KINETIC REACTION TEST WAS MADE TO DETERMINE ALPHA-AMYLASE ACTIVITY. PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE WAS APPLIED AT THE BEGINNING AND AT THE END OF THE INTERVENTION. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS APPLIED USING STATA V11.1 SOFTWARE. SHAPIRO-WILK TEST WAS USED TO DETERMINE DATA DISTRIBUTION. THE PAIRED ANALYSIS WAS FULFILLED BY T-TEST OR WILCOXON SIGNED-RANK TEST. T-TEST OR MANN-WHITNEY'S TEST WAS APPLIED TO COMPARE LONGITUDINAL DATA. A STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE WAS CONSIDERED WHEN P < 0.05. RESULTS: KY PRACTICE HAD AN IMMEDIATE EFFECT ON SALIVARY CORTISOL. THE ACTIVITY OF ALPHA-AMYLASE DID NOT SHOW SIGNIFICANT CHANGES. A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE OF PERCEIVED STRESS IN THE STUDY GROUP WAS FOUND. CONCLUSIONS: KY PRACTICE SHOWS AN IMMEDIATE EFFECT ON SALIVARY CORTISOL LEVELS AND ON PERCEIVED STRESS AFTER 3 MONTHS OF PRACTICE.	2017	

5 2404  32 YOGA AND EPILEPSY: WHAT DO PATIENTS PERCEIVE? CONTEXT: BENEFIT OF YOGA THERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF EPILEPSY IS EMERGING. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO DATA AVAILABLE ABOUT THE KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDE AND PRACTICE (KAP) OF YOGA AMONGST PEOPLE LIVING WITH EPILEPSY (PLWE). AIMS: THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO EXPLORE THE KAP ABOUT YOGA AMONG PLWE. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON 300 PLWE ATTENDING THE NEUROLOGY OUT-PATIENT SERVICES OF A TERTIARY CARE HOSPITAL. METHODOLOGY: THREE HUNDRED PLWE (MALE:FEMALE=173:127; AGE: 31.6+/-12.4 YEARS) ATTENDING THE NEUROLOGY OUT-PATIENT SERVICES OF A NEUROPSYCHIATRY HOSPITAL WERE ADMINISTERED A PRE-TESTED KAP QUESTIONNAIRE. RESULTS: ABOUT 87.4% WERE ON REGULAR ANTI-EPILEPTIC DRUGS AND HALF (50.3%) ON MONOTHERAPY. USE OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE BY THE RESPONDENTS INCLUDED: AYURVEDA (26.7%), YOGA (25.6%) AND HOMEOPATHY (16.3%) OR FOLK MEDICINE (29.1%). NEARLY 33.7% OF THE RESPONDENTS REPORTED THAT YOGA IS BENEFICIAL IN MANAGING EPILEPSY. MORE THAN HALF THE RESPONDENTS (54.8%) WERE WILLING TO PRACTICE YOGA. THOSE WHO PRACTICED YOGA OPINED THAT REGULAR PRACTICE OF YOGA MIGHT REDUCE DOSAGE OF MEDICATION (62.8%), THEIR SIDE EFFECTS (51.3%) AND FREQUENCY OF SEIZURES (54.5%). MAJORITY OF THE PATIENTS WERE WILLING TO PRACTICE YOGA, IF YOGA SERVICES WERE OFFERED. CONCLUSION: THE GAPS IN KAP IDENTIFIED IN THIS STUDY POINT TO THE NEED FOR MORE SYSTEMATIC EFFORT TO BRING ABOUT AWARENESS OF YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH EPILEPSY.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
6 1539  26 KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDE, AND PRACTICE OF YOGA IN MEDICAL STUDENTS: ASSESSMENT OF ANTHROPOMETRY AND LIFESTYLE FACTORS. MEDICAL STUDENTS OFTEN EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT STRESS DURING THEIR UNDERGRADUATE TRAINING. EVIDENCE HAS SHOWN SHORT-TERM YOGA TO BE EFFECTIVE IN DECREASING STRESS IN STUDENTS. THIS STUDY AIMED TO ASSESS KNOWLEDGE ABOUT, ATTITUDE TOWARD, AND PRACTICE OF (KAP) YOGA AMONG MEDICAL STUDENTS. A SECONDARY OBJECTIVE WAS TO ANALYZE THEIR DIETARY HABITS AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. PARTICIPANTS CONSISTED OF 224 MEDICAL STUDENTS AGED 18-23 YEARS IN PRE- AND PARACLINICAL GROUPS. A CLOSED-ENDED KAP QUESTIONNAIRE WAS USED TO COLLECT DATA. ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS WERE TAKEN. RESULTS SHOWED THAT PARACLINICAL STUDENTS (70.5%) FAVORABLY PERCEIVED THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF YOGA. NEARLY THREE-FOURTHS OF STUDY SUBJECTS HAD PREVIOUSLY PRACTICED YOGA; GREATER NUMBERS INTENDED TO PRACTICE YOGA IN THE FUTURE. ABOUT 95.5% OF THE PRECLINICAL STUDENTS WHO HAD DONE YOGA HAD DISCONTINUED THE PRACTICE. PERCEIVED BARRIERS TO THE PRACTICE OF YOGA WERE LACK OF TIME, INSUFFICIENT FACILITIES, LACK OF COMPANY, AND LACK OF INTEREST. CONSIDERATION OF THE UNDERGRADUATES' LIFESTYLE REVEALED THAT 50.4% OF PRECLINICAL STUDENTS DID NOT EXERCISE, AND THEY ROUTINELY CONSUMED MORE JUNK FOOD WITH FEWER SERVINGS OF FRESH FRUITS/SALADS. PRECLINICAL STUDENTS EXHIBITED HIGHER BMI AND WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE COMPARED TO PARACLINICAL STUDENTS. FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT KNOWLEDGE OF AND ATTITUDE REGARDING YOGA WERE GOOD AMONG MEDICAL UNDERGRADUATES.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
7 1985  16 SOME THOUGHTS ON NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS OF YOGA. YOGA PRESENTS THE CULMINATION OF EFFORTS MADE BY MANKIND TILL NOW CONTROL MIND AND BEHAVIOUR. IT IS LIVING SCIENCE, PRACTICED IN AN ELEMENTARY FASHION BY MANY IN INDIA. WHILE A FEW PERHAPS ARE THERE WHO HAVE ATTAINED MASTERY OF THIS SCIENCE.THE BACKGROUND OF THE DERIVATION AND CONCEPT OF YOGA IN INDIA IS PRESENTED FOLLOWED BY A SIMPLE EXPOSITION OF YOGIC PRACTICES AND SOME POSSIBLE NEUROPHYSIOLOGIC EXPLANATIONS.

8   43  22 A CASE REPORT OF PATIENT PRACTISING YOGA LEADING TO DENTAL EROSION. THE ARTICLE PRESENTS THE CASE OF A PATIENT WHO WAS PRACTISING YOGA (KUNJAL KRIYA) WHICH LED TO DENTAL EROSION. DENTAL EROSION CAN BE DUE TO EXTRINSIC OR INTRINSIC CAUSES. THE INTRINSIC CAUSES INCLUDE VOMITING DUE TO ANOREXIA NERVOSA, REGURGITATION DUE TO ABNORMALITY IN GASTRO-INTESTINAL TRACT OR RUMINATION. A 38-YEAR-OLD MALE PATIENT PRESENTED WITH A RARE AETIOLOGY OF DENTAL EROSION. HE HAD PRACTICED KUNJAL KRIYA ONE OF THE YOGIC EXERCISES DESCRIBED IN ANCIENT INDIA. IN KUNJAL KRIYA THE PATIENT VOMITS ON AN EMPTY STOMACH IN ORDER TO CLEAN HIS OR HER GASTRO-INTESTINAL TRACT. THE PATIENT HAD PRACTICED THIS FORM OF EXERCISE FOR OVER 12 YEARS WHICH HAD LED TO SEVERE DENTAL EROSION. A PROPER CASE HISTORY SHOULD BE EVALUATED FOR EVERY PATIENT SO THAT THEY CAN BE COUNSELLED FOR ANY FACTORS THAT COULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO DENTAL HEALTH. EARLY DIAGNOSIS IS PARAMOUNT IN RECOGNISING THE AETIOLOGY OF DENTAL EROSION SO THAT DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON THE DENTITION CAN BE PREVENTED.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
9 1657  29 MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN AND INTEREST IN MEDITATION AND YOGA IN HOME HEALTH AIDES: EVIDENCE FROM THE HOME HEALTH OCCUPATIONS MUSCULOSKELETAL EXAMINATIONS (HHOME) STUDY. HOME HEALTHCARE AIDES (HHAS) ARE A GROWING U.S. WORKFORCE HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO WORKPLACE STRESSORS AND MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN. IN THE PRESENT STUDY WE: 1) EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATION OF MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN TO LIFE SATISFACTION AND EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION; AND 2) CHARACTERIZE INTEREST IN MEDITATION AND YOGA IN A SAMPLE OF HHAS. A NONPROBABILISTIC SAMPLE OF HHAS EMPLOYED AT HOME HEALTHCARE AGENCIES IN FLORIDA, MASSACHUSETTS, AND OREGON (N = 285 TOTAL) COMPLETED A SELF-ADMINISTERED QUESTIONNAIRE WITH STANDARD SURVEY MEASURES ON MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN LOCATION, DURATION, AND SEVERITY; LIFE SATISFACTION; EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION; AND INTEREST IN MEDITATION TECHNIQUES AND YOGA. AMONG HHAS RESPONDING, 48.4% REPORTED PAIN IN THE LAST 7 DAYS AND 46.6% REPORTED PAIN IN THE LAST 3 MONTHS. HOME HEALTHCARE AIDES WHO REPORTED CURRENT PAIN AND CHRONIC PAIN HAD A SIGNIFICANT (P < .05) DECREASE IN SATISFACTION WITH LIFE SCORE AND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION SCORE. THE MAJORITY OF HHAS REPORTED AN INTEREST IN LEARNING ABOUT THE BENEFITS (65.6%) AND PRACTICE (66.4%) OF MEDITATION AND A WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN A YOGA CLASS (59.2%) OR STRESS MANAGEMENT MEETING (59.1%). THE HHAS REPORTED BOTH ACUTE AND CHRONIC MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN THAT WAS CORRELATED WITH LOWER LIFE SATISFACTION AND GREATER EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION. MORE EFFORTS ARE NEEDED TO REDUCE THE SOURCES OF INJURY AND EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
10 2804  25 YOGA THERAPY IN JAPAN. THIS PERSPECTIVE PIECE GIVES AN OVERVIEW OF THE CURRENT SITUATION OF YOGA THERAPY IN JAPAN TODAY. TRADITIONAL YOGA IN JAPAN SUFFERED A SERIOUS SETBACK IN 1995 WITH A NERVE GAS TERRORIST ATTACK ON THE TOKYO SUBWAY, WHICH WAS CARRIED OUT BY A CULT THAT RECRUITED MEMBERS THROUGH YOGA CLASSES. BUT WITH THE INCREASE IN POPULARITY WITH MODERN FORMS OF YOGA SUCH AS IYENGAR YOGA, ASHTANGA YOGA AND HOT YOGA IN THE WEST, THE GENERAL PUBLIC IN JAPAN TODAY IS FORGETTING ITS AVERSION TO YOGA AND CONSIDERS IT TO BE SOMETHING THAT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO GOOD HEALTH. IN 2012, THE JAPAN YOGA THERAPY SOCIETY (JYTS) CONDUCTED A STUDY ON ADVERSE EVENTS IN YOGA CLASSES THROUGHOUT JAPAN WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF KYUSHU SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, WITH SUPPORT FROM THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH, LABOUR AND WELFARE. THIS STUDY INDICATED THAT MORE THAN HALF OF PEOPLE ATTENDING YOGA CLASSES HAVE SOME FORM OF CHRONIC ILLNESS, WITH 42.3% RECEIVING OUTPATIENT CARE. THIS SURVEY WAS THE BEGINNING OF GROWING INTEREST FROM BOTH THE GOVERNMENT AND UNIVERSITIES IN YOGA THERAPY. JYTS IS BEGINNING TO MAKE INROADS INTO BRINGING YOGA THERAPY INTO CANCER AND PALLIATIVE CARE, SENIOR CITIZEN HOMES, ALCOHOL AND DRUG ADDICTION REHABILITATION, CARDIOVASCULAR REHABILITATION, AND RESEARCH ON TRAUMA AND SCHIZOPHRENIA. WHILE THERE ARE STILL LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOGA THERAPISTS TO WORK IN MAINSTREAM HEALTHCARE SERVICES, THERE IS GROWING INTEREST AMONG MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS IN BOTH PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH.

11 2324  22 TREATMENT OF ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION WITH YOGA RELAXATION THERAPY IN A USAF AVIATOR: A CASE REPORT. A 46-YEAR-OLD CAUCASIAN MALE USAF AVIATOR WITH A 6-YEAR HISTORY OF MILD ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION (MEDICAL WAIVER FOR FLIGHT DUTY) UNDER UNSUCCESSFUL TREATMENT WITH HYDROCHLOROTHIAZIDE, DIETARY MODIFICATION, AND EXERCISE, WAS SUBSEQUENTLY TRAINED IN YOGA RELAXATION. AFTER 6 WEEKS, MEDICATION HAD BEEN DISCONTINUED, AND HIS DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE REMAINED WITHIN NORMAL LEVELS. THE PATIENT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY RETURNED TO FULL FLIGHT STATUS WITHOUT RECURRENCE OF DIASTOLIC HYPERTENSION AT FOLLOWUP 6 MONTHS LATER. RELAXATION TRAINING, OF WHICH YOGA IS ONE TYPE, HAS BEEN REPORTED IN THE MEDICAL LITERATURE TO HAVE WIDE CLINICAL APPLICATION. IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS A NONPHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPY ADJUNCT OR ALTERNATIVE FOR MEDICAL DISORDERS AMONG PERSONNEL IN OCCUPATIONS (E.G., AVIATION) WHERE THE SIDE EFFECTS FROM MEDICATIONS ARE OF GREAT CONCERN AND COULD BE DISQUALIFYING FROM THOSE DUTIES.	1989

13 1802  31 PREVALENCE AND PREDICTORS OF YOGIC BREATHING AND MEDITATION USE - A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SURVEY OF US ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS. INTRODUCTION: YOGA PRACTICE IN COMMON USAGE IS OFTEN CONFINED TO THE PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF THE COMPREHENSIVE PRACTICE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE USE OF TWO ADDITIONAL ASPECTS OF YOGA AS PART OF YOGA PRACTICE, I.E. YOGIC BREATHING AND MEDITATION (YOBAM). PREVALENCE AND PREDICTORS OF YOBAM USE AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS IN THE US GENERAL POPULATION WERE ANALYZED. METHOD: CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA FROM THE 2012 AND 2017 NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY (NHIS) (N = 61,267) WAS USED. 12-MONTH PREVALENCE OF YOGA USE AND YOBAM USE AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS WERE ANALYZED DESCRIPTIVELY FOR THE TWO COHORTS RESPECTIVELY. LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSES WERE USED TO ANALYZE SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND HEALTH-RELATED PREDICTORS OF YOBAM USE AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS. RESULTS: 12-MONTH PREVALENCE OF YOGA USE AND YOBAM USE WERE 8.9 % AND 4.8 % RESPECTIVELY IN 2012. IN 2017, 13.3 % HAD PRACTICED YOGA IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS AND 7.0 % HAD USED YOBAM. YOGA PRACTITIONERS AGED BETWEEN 50 AND 64 COMPARED TO BEING 29 OR YOUNGER, FEMALES, HISPANICS AND THOSE EXPERIENCING MILD TO SEVERE FORMS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS WERE MORE LIKELY TO USE YOBAM AS PART OF THEIR YOGA PRACTICE. YOGA PRACTITIONERS LIVING IN THE MIDWEST OR IN A RELATIONSHIP WERE LESS LIKELY TO USE YOBAM. CONCLUSION: IN RECENT YEARS, THE NUMBER OF YOGA PRACTITIONERS IN THE US GENERAL POPULATION HAS CONSIDERABLY INCREASED AND YOBAM USE IS COMMON AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS. YOBAM USE SEEMS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH AGE, GENDER, ETHNICITY, REGION, MARITAL STATUS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS DIMENSIONS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
14 2052  29 THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN REGULAR YOGA AND MEDITATION PRACTICE AND FALLS AND INJURIES: RESULTS OF A NATIONAL CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY AMONG AUSTRALIAN WOMEN. INTRODUCTION: FALLS ARE THE LEADING CAUSE OF INJURIES IN WOMEN ACROSS ALL AGES. WHILE YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE BALANCE, IT HAS ALSO BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH INJURIES DUE TO FALLS DURING PRACTICE. THIS STUDY AIMED TO ANALYSE WHETHER REGULAR YOGA OR MEDITATION PRACTICE IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FREQUENCY OF FALLS AND FALL-RELATED INJURIES IN UPPER MIDDLE-AGED AUSTRALIAN WOMEN. METHODS: WOMEN AGED 59-64 YEARS FROM THE AUSTRALIAN LONGITUDINAL STUDY ON WOMEN'S HEALTH (ALSWH) WERE QUERIED REGARDING FALLS AND FALLS-RELATED INJURIES; AND WHETHER THEY REGULARLY PRACTICED YOGA OR MEDITATION. ASSOCIATIONS OF FALLS AND FALLS-RELATED INJURIES WITH YOGA OR MEDITATION PRACTICE WERE ANALYSED USING CHI-SQUARED TESTS AND MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELLING. RESULTS: OF 10,011 WOMEN, 4413 (44.1%) HAD SLIPPED, TRIPPED OR STUMBLED, 2770 (27.7%) HAD FALLEN TO THE GROUND, 1398 (14.0%) HAD BEEN INJURED AS A RESULT OF FALLING, AND 901 (9.0%) WOMEN HAD SOUGHT MEDICAL ATTENTION FOR A FALL-RELATED INJURY WITHIN THE PREVIOUS 12 MONTHS. YOGA OR MEDITATION WAS PRACTICED REGULARLY BY 746 (7.5%) WOMEN. NO ASSOCIATIONS OF FALLS, FALL-RELATED INJURIES AND TREATMENT DUE TO FALLS-RELATED INJURY WITH YOGA OR MEDITATION PRACTICE WERE FOUND. DISCUSSION: NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN YOGA OR MEDITATION PRACTICE AND FALLS OR FALL-RELATED INJURIES HAVE BEEN FOUND. FURTHER STUDIES ARE WARRANTED FOR CONCLUSIVE JUDGEMENT OF BENEFITS AND SAFETY OF YOGA AND MEDITATION IN RELATION TO BALANCE, FALLS AND FALL-RELATED INJURIES.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
15 1806  34 PREVALENCE, PATTERNS, AND PREDICTORS OF YOGA PRACTICE AMONG ADULTS IN AN URBAN POPULATION IN EASTERN INDIA. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE PREVALENCE AND PREDICTORS OF YOGA PRACTICE. THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AS A PART OF A LARGER STUDY THAT INCLUDED YOGA AS A FORM OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. DATA WERE COLLECTED DURING APRIL AND AUGUST 2019 FROM THE ADULT URBAN POPULATION OF BHUBANESWAR, INDIA. THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED USING A CLUSTER RANDOM SAMPLING METHOD. A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE (N = 1,203) OF ADULTS AGED 18-59 YEARS, IRRESPECTIVE OF GENDER, WAS INTERVIEWED USING A QUESTIONNAIRE ADAPTED FROM THE 2012 U.S. NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY, WITH THE EPICOLLECT5 HANDHELD DATA-COLLECTION TOOL. PREDICTORS OF YOGA PRACTICE WERE EXPLORED USING MULTIVARIABLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION. THE MEAN AGE OF THE PARTICIPANTS WAS 35.19 +/- 10.67 YEARS, WITH 55.3% MALES. THE MAJORITY WERE HINDU (93.62%) AND BELONGED TO THE UNRE S E RVED CATEGORY (65.60%), PEOPLE GENERALLY OF HIGHER RELATIVE SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. THE LIFETIME PREVALENCE OF YOGA WAS 16.9%. PREVALENCE OF ANY FORM OF YOGA (YOGA, PRANAYAMA, OR MEDITATION), ALL FORMS OF YOGA (YOGA, PRANAYAMA, AND MEDITATION), PRANAYAMA, AND MEDITATION WAS 17.0%, 10.7%, 14.3%, AND 11.4%, RESPECTIVELY. AFTER ADJUSTING FOR CONFOUNDERS, FEMALE GENDER, HINDU RELIGION, MINIMUM OF HIGHER-SECONDARY OR GRADUATE-LEVEL EDUCATION, AND HAVING RECEIVED ADVICE FROM PROFESSIONALS FOR YOGA PRACTICE HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ODDS OF PRACTICING YOGA, AND THOSE OF HIGHER SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER ODDS OF PRACTICING YOGA. WE FOUND A LOW PREVALENCE OF YOGA. SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS LIKE GENDER, RELIGION, EDUCATION, SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, AND OTHER FACTORS LIKE LEARNING YOGA FROM PROFESSIONALS MAY BE IMPORTANT PREDICTORS OF CONTINUED YOGA PRACTICE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
16 2876  31 YOGA-RELATED INJURIES IN THE UNITED STATES FROM 2001 TO 2014. BACKGROUND: YOGA HAS BECOME MORE POPULAR AMONG PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES AND HAS BEEN TOUTED BY BOTH YOGA PARTICIPANTS AS WELL AS SOME PHYSICIANS AND RESEARCHERS FOR ITS HEALTH BENEFITS. WHILE THE HEALTH BENEFITS HAVE BEEN STUDIED, THE FREQUENCY OF INJURY AMONG YOGA PARTICIPANTS HAS NOT BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED. PURPOSE: INJURY INCIDENCE, RATES, AND TYPES ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE NOT BEEN QUANTIFIED. THIS STUDY ESTIMATES US YOGA-ASSOCIATED INJURY INCIDENCE AND CHARACTERIZES INJURY TYPE OVER A 13-YEAR PERIOD. STUDY DESIGN: DESCRIPTIVE EPIDEMIOLOGY STUDY. METHODS: DATA FROM THE NATIONAL ELECTRONIC INJURY SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM (NEISS) FROM 2001 TO 2014 WERE USED TO ESTIMATE THE INCIDENCE AND TYPE OF YOGA-ASSOCIATED INJURIES. THE NUMBER AND AGE DISTRIBUTION OF YOGA PARTICIPANTS WAS ESTIMATED USING DATA FROM NATIONAL HEALTH STATISTICS REPORTS. THESE NATIONAL POPULATION ESTIMATES WERE APPLIED TO THE NEISS DATA TO DETERMINE INJURY RATES OVERALL AND STRATIFIED ACCORDING TO AGE CATEGORIES. RESULTS: THERE WERE 29,590 YOGA-RELATED INJURIES SEEN IN HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS FROM 2001 TO 2014. THE TRUNK (46.6%) WAS THE MOST FREQUENT REGION INJURED, AND SPRAIN/STRAIN (45.0%) ACCOUNTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF DIAGNOSES. THE INJURY RATE INCREASED OVERALL FROM 2001 TO 2014, AND IT WAS GREATEST FOR THOSE AGED 65 YEARS AND OLDER (57.9/100,000) COMPARED WITH THOSE AGED 18 TO 44 YEARS (11.9/100,000) AND 45 TO 64 YEARS (17.7/100,000) IN 2014. CONCLUSION: PARTICIPANTS AGED 65 YEARS AND OLDER HAVE A GREATER RATE OF INJURY FROM PRACTICING YOGA WHEN COMPARED WITH OTHER AGE GROUPS. MOST INJURIES SUSTAINED WERE TO THE TRUNK AND INVOLVED A SPRAIN/STRAIN. WHILE THERE ARE MANY HEALTH BENEFITS TO PRACTICING YOGA, PARTICIPANTS AND THOSE WISHING TO BECOME PARTICIPANTS SHOULD CONFER WITH A PHYSICIAN PRIOR TO ENGAGING IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND PRACTICE ONLY UNDER THE GUIDANCE OF CERTIFIED INSTRUCTORS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                             
17 1070  32 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN. PURPOSE: MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH WORK STRESS AND A SHORTENED CAREER IN THE DENTAL HYGIENE PROFESSION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE IF PARTICIPATING IN TWO YOGA SESSIONS PER WEEK WOULD REDUCE THE MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN REPORTED BY DENTAL HYGIENE STUDENTS AND OR IMPACT BODY COMPOSITION.METHODS: A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF 77 DENTAL HYGIENE STUDENTS SELF-SELECTED INTO TREATMENT (YOGA) AND CONTROL GROUPS. STUDENTS IN THE YOGA GROUP PARTICIPATED IN BI-WEEKLY, 60-MINUTE YOGA SESSIONS FOR 13 CONSECUTIVE WEEKS. STUDENTS COMPLETED A QUESTIONNAIRE AND A COMPARATIVE PAIN SCALE EVALUATION PRIOR TO AND IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE STUDY PERIOD TO ASSESS MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN. ADDITIONALLY, THE OMRON HBF-514C FULL BODY COMPOSITION SENSING MONITOR AND SCALE WAS USED TO MEASURE BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), BODY FAT, AND MUSCLE PRIOR TO AND UPON COMPLETION OF THE STUDY. PAIRED SAMPLE T-TESTS AND INDEPENDENT T-TESTS WERE USED TO ANALYZE THE DATA.RESULTS: THIRTY-EIGHT DENTAL HYGIENE STUDENTS, WITH AN AVERAGE AGE OF 23.9 YEARS, PARTICIPATED IN THE YOGA GROUP AND 39 WERE ASSIGNED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. THE MAJORITY OF THE PARTICIPANTS WERE CAUCASIAN (63.6%) FEMALES (90.9%). PARTICIPANTS IN BOTH GROUPS WERE OF SIMILAR AGE, ETHNICITY, AND HAD COMPARABLE PRE-STUDY HARICH COMPARATIVE PAIN SCALE SCORES. AFTER PARTICIPATING IN THE YOGA SESSIONS, THE TREATMENT GROUP REPORTED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN (P<0.001), WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP REPORTED NO SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN (P=0.881). THE YOGA SESSIONS DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE BMI SCORES FOR THE YOGA TREATMENT GROUP (P=.984) OR THE CONTROL GROUP (P=.901).CONCLUSION: THIS RESEARCH SUPPORTS THE PRACTICE OF BI-WEEKLY YOGA SESSIONS AS BENEFICIAL IN DECREASING MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN IN DENTAL HYGIENE STUDENTS. YOGA CAN BE CONSIDERED A VIABLE COMPLEMENTARY HEALTH APPROACH TO INCORPORATE INTO STUDENT SCHEDULES AS A MEANS OF INCREASING THE HEALTH AND LONGEVITY OF A DENTAL HYGIENE CAREER.	2017	
                                                                                
18 2297  18 THERAPEUTIC ROLE OF YOGA IN NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS. YOGA IS CONSIDERED A WIDELY-USED APPROACH FOR HEALTH CONSERVATION AND CAN BE ADOPTED AS A TREATMENT MODALITY FOR A PLETHORA OF MEDICAL CONDITIONS, INCLUDING NEUROLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS. HENCE, WE REVIEWED RELEVANT ARTICLES ENTAILING VARIOUS NEUROLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS AND GATHERED DATA ON HOW YOGA EXERTS POSITIVE IMPACTS ON PATIENTS WITH A DIVERSE RANGE OF DISORDERS, INCLUDING ITS MODULATORY EFFECTS ON BRAIN BIOELECTRICAL ACTIVITIES, NEUROTRANSMITTERS, AND SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY. THE ROLE OF YOGA PRACTICE AS AN ELEMENT OF THE TREATMENT OF SEVERAL NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL DISEASES WAS EVALUATED BASED ON THESE FINDINGS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
19 1807  33 PREVALENCE, PATTERNS, AND PREDICTORS OF YOGA USE: RESULTS OF A U.S. NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SURVEY. INTRODUCTION: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE PREVALENCE, PATTERNS, AND PREDICTORS OF YOGA USE IN THE U.S. GENERAL POPULATION. METHODS: USING CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA FROM THE 2012 NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY FAMILY CORE, SAMPLE ADULT CORE, AND ADULT COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE QUESTIONNAIRES (N=34,525), WEIGHTED FREQUENCIES FOR LIFETIME AND 12-MONTH PREVALENCE OF YOGA USE AND PATTERNS OF YOGA PRACTICE WERE ANALYZED. USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSES, SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC PREDICTORS OF LIFETIME YOGA USE WERE ANALYZED. ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED IN 2015. RESULTS: LIFETIME AND 12-MONTH PREVALENCE OF YOGA USE WERE 13.2% AND 8.9%, RESPECTIVELY. COMPARED WITH NONPRACTITIONERS, LIFETIME YOGA PRACTITIONERS WERE MORE LIKELY FEMALE, YOUNGER, NON-HISPANIC WHITE, COLLEGE EDUCATED, HIGHER EARNERS, LIVING IN THE WEST, AND OF BETTER HEALTH STATUS. AMONG THOSE WHO HAD PRACTICED IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS, 51.2% ATTENDED YOGA CLASSES, 89.9% USED BREATHING EXERCISES, AND 54.9% USED MEDITATION. YOGA WAS PRACTICED FOR GENERAL WELLNESS OR DISEASE PREVENTION (78.4%), TO IMPROVE ENERGY (66.1%), OR TO IMPROVE IMMUNE FUNCTION (49.7%). BACK PAIN (19.7%), STRESS (6.4%), AND ARTHRITIS (6.4%) WERE THE MAIN SPECIFIC HEALTH PROBLEMS FOR WHICH PEOPLE PRACTICED YOGA. CONCLUSIONS: ABOUT 31 MILLION U.S. ADULTS HAVE EVER USED YOGA, AND ABOUT 21 MILLION PRACTICED YOGA IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS. DISEASE PREVENTION AND BACK PAIN RELIEF WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT HEALTH REASONS FOR YOGA PRACTICE. YOGA PRACTICE IS ASSOCIATED WITH AGE, GENDER, ETHNICITY, SES, AND HEALTH STATUS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
20 2898  28 [EFFECTS OF FITNESS TRAINING AND YOGA ON WELL-BEING STRESS, SOCIAL COMPETENCE AND BODY IMAGE]. OBJECTIVES: AIMS OF OUR STUDY WERE TO DESCRIBE AND COMPARE INFLUENCES FROM A PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PROGRAM AND A YOGA PROGRAM ON WELL-BEING, MOOD, STRESSCOPING, BODY-IMAGE AND SOCIAL COMPETENCE IN HEALTHY PEOPLE. METHODS: 18 PERSONS ATTENDING A GYM AND 21 TAKING PART IN A YOGA PROGRAM ANSWERED FOLLOWING QUESTIONNAIRES BEFORE ENTERING THE PROGRAM AND AFTER TAKING PART FOR 20 UNITS: BODY-IMAGE-QUESTIONNAIRE (25), SYMPTOM-CHECKLIST- 90R (8), COMPLAINT- LIST (31), ADJECTIVE MOOD-SCALE (32) AND A VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE FOR ASSESSING STRESS-LEVEL (10). RESULTS: STATISTICAL ANALYSES SHOW SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SOCIAL COMPETENCE IN BOTH TRAINING GROUPS; THE GYM-GROUP REPORT REDUCED SEXUAL DISCOMFORT, WHEREAS PEOPLE TAKING PART IN YOGA-GROUP SHOW A REDUCTION IN SOMATIZATION AND BODY-RELATED ANXIETY AS WELL AS AN IMPROVEMENT IN PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING. CONCLUSION: OUR FINDINGS SUPPORT THE EVIDENCE THAT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN GENERAL IMPROVES PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING, HOWEVER, GYM AND YOGA SEEM TO HAVE DIFFERENT PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACTS. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD FOCUS ON COMPARING THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY INTERVENTIONS IN PREVENTION PROGRAMMES AS WELL AS EXERCISE PRESCRIPTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS.	2009

1 2526 104 YOGA EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR IMPROVING MEMORY IN OLDER ADULTS: A MULTICITY 5-YEAR FOLLOW-UP STUDY. THIS ARTICLE REPORTS A MULTICITY STUDY ON THE EFFECT OF A YOGA EDUCATION PROGRAM (YEP) IN IMPROVING MEMORY AND COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS OF A NONCLINICAL SAMPLE OF COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS. SPECIFICALLY, THE INTERVENING PERSONAL RESOURCES THAT BOLSTER OR HINDER YEP EFFECTIVENESS WERE EXAMINED. OF THE ORIGINAL COHORT OF 918 OLDER ADULTS RANDOMIZED INTO INTERVENTION AND WAITLIST CONTROL GROUPS, 792 REMAINED WITH THE STUDY 5 YEARS LATER. RESULTS INDICATED THAT WEEKLY YEP LESSONS AND SELF-PRACTICE IMPROVED PARTICIPANTS' SCORES ON THE MINI-MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION (MMSE) AND RIVERMEAD BEHAVIORAL MEMORY TEST-THIRD EDITION (RBMT-3). PARTICIPANTS FROM ASIAN CITIES, WOMEN, HINDUS AND BUDDHISTS, MIDDLE CLASS, HIGHLY EDUCATED, RETIRED, EVER SINGLE OR WIDOWED, LIVING ALONE OR WITH CHILDREN AND KIN, WERE MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE YEP. REGULAR ATTENDANCE AND SELF-PRACTICE WERE STRONG MODERATORS OF YEP EFFECTIVENESS, WITH SELF-PRACTICE HAVING THE STRONGEST PREDICTOR EFFECT. SOME CULTURAL VARIATIONS AND IMPROVISATIONS WOULD LEND THE YEP A WIDER APPLICATION.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
2 1352  25 IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF MIND SOUND RESONANCE TECHNIQUE (MSRT - A YOGA-BASED RELAXATION TECHNIQUE) ON BLOOD PRESSURE, HEART RATE, AND STATE ANXIETY IN INDIVIDUALS WITH HYPERTENSION: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND MIND SOUND RESONANCE TECHNIQUE (MSRT) IS A YOGA-BASED RELAXATION TECHNIQUE. PREVIOUS STUDIES ON MSRT DEMONSTRATED ITS POTENTIAL HEALTH-BENEFITING EFFECTS IN BOTH CLINICAL AND NONCLINICAL POPULATION. PRESENT STUDY INTENDED TO ASSESS THE ACUTE EFFECT OF MSRT INTERVENTION ON BLOOD PRESSURE, HEART RATE (HR), AND STATE ANXIETY IN PATIENTS WITH ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION (HTN). METHODS THIRTY PARTICIPANTS (13 FEMALES) WITH HTN, WITHIN THE AGE RANGE 30-60 YEARS (WITH MEAN+/-SD: 57.23+/-11.3 YEARS), WHO VISITED SVYASA UNIVERSITY CAMPUS TO ATTEND 1-WEEK RESIDENTIAL YOGA PROGRAM FOR HTN TREATMENT, WERE CONSIDERED FOR THIS STUDY BASED ON INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA. ALL PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED A 4-DAY MSRT ORIENTATION SESSIONS PRIOR TO THE STUDY. EACH PARTICIPANT UNDERWENT 30-MIN SESSION OF BOTH MSRT AND SUPINE REST (SR) ON 2 SUCCESSIVE DAYS. SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURES, PULSE RATE, AND STATE ANXIETY WERE MEASURED BEFORE AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER BOTH MSRT AND SR SESSIONS. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING SPSS VERSION 16. REPEATED-MEASURE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE WAS APPLIED TO ASSESS WITHIN-SUBJECTS CHANGES. RESULTS AFTER MSRT SESSION, SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (SBP), DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (DBP), HR, AND STATE ANXIETY WAS OBSERVED COMPARED TO BASELINE. SIMILARLY, AFTER SR SESSION, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE FOUND IN HR AND STATE ANXIETY. NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE WAS SEEN IN SBP AND DBP FOLLOWING SR COMPARED TO SR SESSION; MSRT SESSION SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER IMPROVEMENT IN SBP, DBP, HR, AND STATE ANXIETY. CONCLUSION PRESENT STUDY DEMONSTRATED THE USEFULNESS OF SINGLE SESSION OF MSRT IN REDUCING BLOOD PRESSURE, HR, AND STATE ANXIETY AMONG INDIVIDUALS WITH HTN AS COMPARED TO SR. THESE FINDINGS ENCOURAGE THE FURTHER STUDIES WITH LARGER SAMPLE SIZE AND LONG-TERM INTERVENTION WITH A ROBUST RESEARCH DESIGN.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                               
3 1636  21 MODERN POSTURAL YOGA AS A MENTAL HEALTH PROMOTING TOOL: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. YOGA HAS BEEN GAINING POPULARITY AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS, BUT RESEARCH ON THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IS STILL IN ITS BEGINNINGS. THE AIM OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW IS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF MODERN POSTURAL YOGA (STRONG FOCUS ON PHYSICAL POSTURES) ON POSITIVE MENTAL HEALTH (PMH) INDICATORS IN CLINICAL AND NONCLINICAL POPULATIONS. THE MOST COMMON PMH INDICATORS WERE MINDFULNESS, AFFECT, RESILIENCE AND WELL-BEING, FOLLOWED BY SATISFACTION WITH LIFE, SELF-COMPASSION, EMPATHY AND OTHERS. DIVERSE RESULTS WERE FOUND ACROSS THE 14 STUDIES ANALYSED, INCLUDING SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA PRACTICE ON OUTCOME VARIABLES, TO NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS, BOTH IN RELATION TO BASELINE LEVELS AND IN RELATION TO CONTROL GROUPS. NONETHELESS, MOST STUDIES OBSERVED AMELIORATIONS IN PMH INDICATORS DUE TO YOGA PRACTICE. GIVEN THAT YOGA INTERVENTIONS POSE SERIOUS METHODOLOGICAL CONCERNS, MORE RESEARCH AND BETTER EXPERIMENTAL DESIGNS ARE NEEDED TO PROPERLY ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PMH INDICATORS.	2018

5 1083  23 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS AMONG HEALTHY ADULTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. BACKGROUND: YOGA WAS RECOMMENDED IN BOTH CLINICAL AND NONCLINICAL POPULATIONS AS THERAPY METHODS. THE DIVERSITY OF YOGA PRACTICE AS A THERAPY METHOD HAS RARELY BEEN DISCUSSED AND IT IS ESSENTIAL TO ADDRESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS. PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVE: THIS ARTICLE AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF YOGA ON STRESS IN HEALTHY POPULATION. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE AUTHORS INTENDED TO FIGURE OUT YOGA EFFECTS ON STRESS SYSTEMATICALLY. METHODS/DESIGN: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY ARTICLES THAT ASSESS THE EFFECT OF YOGA AND YOGA-RELATED INTERVENTIONS ON STRESS REDUCTION IN NONCLINICAL POPULATIONS. STUDIES WERE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE LENGTH OF THE INTERVENTION, YOGA TYPE, AND MEASURES OF OUTCOME. THE STUDIES WERE SELECTED THROUGHOUT LAST 5 YEARS (JANUARY 2014 TO NOVEMBER 2018) BY USING THE KEY SEARCHING TERM YOGA AND STRESS INCORPORATION WITH TENSION AND PRESSURE. THE SELECTION PROCESS FOLLOWED THE PRISMA FLOW DIAGRAM. RESULTS: TOTALLY, 12 ARTICLES ELABORATING ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA OR YOGA-RELATED INTERVENTIONS ON STRESS MANAGEMENT AND REMISSION WERE INCLUDED IN THE REVIEW. THIS REVIEW INCLUDED VARIOUS TYPES OF YOGA PRACTICE (E.G., HATHA YOGA, BIKRAM YOGA, KUNDALINI YOGA, SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA, KRIPALU YOGA, YIN YOGA). A TIME SPECTRUM WAS CONDUCTED FROM 4 WKS TO 28 WKS. THIS REVIEW REVEALED THAT MOST TYPES OF YOGA HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON STRESS REDUCTION IN HEATHY POPULATIONS. CONCLUSION: FURTHER STUDIES ARE RECOMMENDED TO EXAMINE THE LONG-TERM EFFECT OF YOGA AND UNDERLYING PSYCHOLOGICAL MECHANISMS CAUSING STRESS AND MENTAL RESTRAIN. IN ADDITION, IT IS SUGGESTED TO CONSIDER AGE AS A RISK FACTOR AFFECTING THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON STRESS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
6 2528  32 YOGA EDUCATION PROGRAM FOR REDUCING DRUG DEPENDENCY AND PROMOTING BETTER ASTHMA CONTROL FOR CHRONIC ASTHMATIC CHILDREN: A MULTICITY EXPERIMENT. THIS ARTICLE REPORTS A 1-YEAR LONG YOGA EDUCATION PROGRAM (YEP) EXPERIMENT AIMED AT REDUCING DRUG DEPENDENCY AND PROMOTING BETTER ASTHMA CONTROL FOR CHRONIC ASTHMATIC CHILDREN. PARTICIPANTS WERE 450 CHRONIC ASTHMATIC CHILDREN ACROSS 4 CITIES. TWO MEASURES WERE USED: PEDIATRIC ASTHMA DIARY (PAD) AND CHILDHOOD ASTHMA CONTROL TEST (C-ACT). RESULTS INDICATED THAT INTERVENTION GROUP CHILDREN HAD BETTER ASTHMA CONTROL IN TERMS OF LOWER AVERAGE PAD SCORES AND HIGHER C-ACT SCORES AND REDUCED DRUG INTAKE VIS-A-VIS THE CONTROL GROUP. WITHIN THE INTERVENTION COHORT, ASTHMA SYMPTOMS PERSISTENCE WAS LOWER AND CONTROL WAS HIGHER FOR CHILDREN FROM ASIAN CITIES, BOYS, HINDUS, MIDDLE-CLASS CHILDREN, THOSE WHOSE MOTHERS WERE THEIR PRIMARY CAREGIVERS, WHO LIVED IN STANDARD FAMILY SETUPS, WHO ALSO ATTENDED THE OPTIONAL YEP ROUNDS, AND REGULARLY SELF-PRACTICED. THE STRONGEST PREDICTOR OF LOWER POSTTEST PAD SCORES AND HIGHER C-ACT SCORES WAS SELF-PRACTICE. THE YEP CAN BE USED AS AN EFFECTIVE COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC ASTHMATIC CHILDREN.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
7  729  26 EFFECT OF MIND SOUND RESONANCE TECHNIQUE (MSRT - A YOGA-BASED RELAXATION TECHNIQUE) ON PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIABLES AND COGNITION IN SCHOOL CHILDREN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: SCHOOL CHILDREN UNDERGO STRESS, WHICH COULD IMPACT THEIR PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS AND COGNITIVE ABILITIES. YOGA PRACTICES HAVE BEEN FOUND USEFUL IN ENHANCING PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS AND PERFORMANCE. THE CURRENT STUDY WAS PLANNED TO EVALUATE A YOGA-BASED RELAXATION TECHNIQUE'S EFFICACY AS AN EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITY ON PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION. DESIGN AND SETTING: THIS STUDY WAS A PARALLEL-GROUP RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL CONDUCTED AT A GOVERNMENT SCHOOL IN SOUTH INDIA. PARTICIPANTS: SIXTY STUDENTS WITH AGE RANGING BETWEEN 14-16 YEARS (MEAN AGE +/- SD; 15.3 +/- 0.71 YEARS) SATISFYING THE INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA WERE RANDOMIZED TO EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUPS WITH AN ALLOCATION RATIO OF 1:1. INTERVENTION: EXPERIMENTAL GROUP RECEIVED MIND SOUND RESONANCE TECHNIQUE (MSRT), WHEREAS THE CONTROL GROUP PERFORMED SUPINE REST (SR) FOR TWO-WEEKS. OUTCOME MEASURES: PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSESSED WITH STATE TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY - SHORT FORM, MIND WANDERING QUESTIONNAIRE, STATE MINDFULNESS ATTENTION AWARENESS SCALE, AND TRAIL MAKING TASK AT BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION. RESULTS: EXPERIMENTAL GROUP SHOWED A REDUCTION IN STATE ANXIETY AND MIND WANDERING WITH IMPROVEMENT IN STATE MINDFULNESS AND PERFORMANCE IN THE TRAIL-MAKING TASK COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: RESULTS OF THE CURRENT TRIAL INDICATE THE BENEFICIAL ROLE OF MSRT IN ENHANCING PSYCHOLOGICAL AND COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS IN CHILDREN. FURTHER, LARGE-SCALE TRIALS ARE WARRANTED TO ASCERTAIN THE USEFULNESS OF THE TECHNIQUE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
8 2182  21 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON POSITIVE MENTAL HEALTH AMONG HEALTHY ADULTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVES: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO PRESENT AN OVERVIEW OF THE RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON POSITIVE MENTAL HEALTH (PMH) AMONG NON-CLINICAL ADULT POPULATIONS. METHODS: THIS WAS A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS, INCLUDING A RISK OF BIAS ASSESSMENT. THE ELECTRONIC DATABASES PUBMED/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, INDMED, AND THE COCHRANE LIBRARY WERE SEARCHED FROM 1975 TO 2015. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON PMH AMONG A HEALTHY ADULT POPULATION WERE SELECTED. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 17 RCTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE META-ANALYSIS. FOUR INDICATORS OF PMH WERE FOUND: PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING, LIFE SATISFACTION, SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND MINDFULNESS. A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING IN FAVOR OF YOGA OVER NO ACTIVE CONTROL WAS FOUND. OVERALL RISK OF BIAS WAS UNCLEAR DUE TO INCOMPLETE REPORTING. CONCLUSIONS: THE CURRENT BODY OF RESEARCH OFFERS WEAK EVIDENCE THAT THE PRACTICE OF YOGA CONTRIBUTES TO AN INCREASE IN PMH AMONG ADULTS FROM NON-CLINICAL POPULATIONS IN GENERAL. YOGA WAS FOUND TO CONTRIBUTE TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING WHEN COMPARED TO NO INTERVENTION BUT NOT COMPARED TO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. FOR LIFE SATISFACTION (EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING), SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS (SOCIAL WELL-BEING), AND MINDFULNESS NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS FOR YOGA WERE FOUND OVER ACTIVE OR NON-ACTIVE CONTROLS. DUE TO THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF STUDIES, THE HETEROGENEITY OF THE INTERVENTION, AND PERHAPS THE WAY PMH IS BEING MEASURED, ANY DEFINITE CONCLUSIONS ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PMH CANNOT BE DRAWN.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
9 1677  31 OLDER WOMEN AND WELLBEING THROUGH THE PANDEMIC: EXAMINING THE EFFECT OF DAILY ONLINE YOGA LESSONS. THE RESEARCHER REPORTS THE IMPACT OF ONLINE YOGA LESSONS ON A COHORT OF COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULT WOMEN IN MITIGATING FEARS, ANXIETIES AND PROMOTING RESILIENCE, WELLBEING AND SALUTOGENIC WELLNESS DURING THE PANDEMIC AS COMPARED TO A CONTROL GROUP. ONLINE YOGA LESSONS WERE EFFECTIVE AND ECONOMIC CLASS, EDUCATION, RELIGION, MARITAL STATUS, AND LIVING ARRANGEMENTS WERE SIGNIFICANT MODERATORS. INTERVENTION ADHERENCE HAD THE STRONGEST PREDICTOR EFFECTS. THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS WERE ROBUST AND LATENT CLASS ANALYSES INDICATED MIDDLE CLASS, ABOVE THRESHOLD (>50%) LESSONS ATTENDEES AND SELF-PRACTICE DOERS, SINGLE, LIVING IN NONSTANDARD FAMILIES, COLLEGE EDUCATED, AND HINDUS, WERE LIKELY TO GAIN MOST.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
10 1832  20 PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING, HEALTH BEHAVIORS, AND WEIGHT LOSS AMONG PARTICIPANTS IN A RESIDENTIAL, KRIPALU YOGA-BASED WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM. UNLABELLED: THE INCREASING PREVALENCE OF OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY IN HUMANS IS A GROWING PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN IN THE UNITED STATES. CONCOMITANTS INCLUDE POOR HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND REDUCED PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING. PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE SUGGESTS YOGA AND TREATMENT PARADIGMS INCORPORATING MINDFULNESS, SELF-COMPASSION (SC), ACCEPTANCE, NON-DIETING, AND INTUITIVE EATING MAY IMPROVE THESE ANCILLARY CORRELATES, WHICH MAY PROMOTE LONG-TERM WEIGHT LOSS. METHODS: WE EXPLORED THE IMPACT OF A 5-DAY RESIDENTIAL WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM, WHICH WAS MULTIFACETED AND BASED ON KRIPALU YOGA, ON HEALTH BEHAVIORS, WEIGHT LOSS, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING IN OVERWEIGHT/OBESE INDIVIDUALS. THIRTY-SEVEN OVERWEIGHT/OBESE PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS (AGE 32-65, BMI<25) COMPLETED VALIDATED MIND-FULNESS, SC, LIFESTYLE BEHAVIOR, AND MOOD QUESTIONNAIRES AT BASELINE, POST-PROGRAM, AND 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP AND REPORTED THEIR WEIGHT 1 YEAR AFTER PROGRAM COMPLETION. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN NUTRITION BEHAVIORS, SC, MINDFULNESS, STRESS MANAGEMENT, AND SPIRITUAL GROWTH WERE OBSERVED IMMEDIATELY POST-PROGRAM (N = 31, 84% RETENTION), WITH MEDIUM TO LARGE EFFECT SIZES. AT 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP (N = 18, 49% RETENTION), MOST CHANGES PERSISTED. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND MOOD DISTURBANCE HAD IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY POST-PROGRAM BUT FAILED TO REACH SIGNIFICANCE AT 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. SELF-REPORT WEIGHT LOSS AT 1 YEAR (N = 19, 51% RETENTION) WAS SIGNIFICANT. CONCLUSION: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST A KRIPALU YOGA-BASED, RESIDENTIAL WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM MAY FOSTER PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING, IMPROVED NUTRITION BEHAVIORS, AND WEIGHT LOSS. GIVEN THE EXPLORATORY NATURE OF THIS INVESTIGATION, MORE RIGOROUS WORK IN THIS AREA IS WARRANTED.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
11 1345  25 HYPERTENSION ANALYSIS OF STRESS REDUCTION USING MINDFULNESS MEDITATION AND YOGA (THE HARMONY STUDY): STUDY PROTOCOL OF A RANDOMISED CONTROL TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: HYPERTENSION (HTN) IS A LEADING RISK FACTOR FOR PREVENTABLE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, WITH OVER ONE IN FIVE ADULTS AFFECTED WORLDWIDE. LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION IS A KEY STRATEGY FOR THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF HTN. STRESS HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER CARDIOVASCULAR RISK, AND STRESS MANAGEMENT IS A RECOMMENDED INTERVENTION FOR HYPERTENSIVES. STRESS REDUCTION THROUGH RELAXATION THERAPIES HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE AN EFFECT ON HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY, INCLUDING LOWERING BLOOD PRESSURE (BP). HOWEVER, INDIVIDUALISED BEHAVIOURAL INTERVENTIONS ARE RESOURCE INTENSIVE, AND GROUP STRESS MANAGEMENT APPROACHES HAVE NOT BEEN VALIDATED FOR REDUCING HTN. THE HARMONY STUDY IS A PILOT RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL DESIGNED TO DETERMINE IF MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION (MBSR), A STANDARDISED GROUP THERAPY, IS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR LOWERING BP IN STAGE 1 UNMEDICATED HYPERTENSIVES. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: MEN AND WOMEN UNMEDICATED FOR HTN WITH MEAN DAYTIME AMBULATORY BLOOD PRESSURE (ABP) >/=135/85 MM HG OR 24 H ABP >/=130/80 MM HG ARE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. SUBJECTS ARE RANDOMISED TO RECEIVE MBSR IMMEDIATELY OR AFTER A WAIT-LIST CONTROL PERIOD. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE IS MEAN AWAKE AND 24 H ABP. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE HARMONY STUDY IS TO COMPARE ABP BETWEEN THE TREATMENT AND WAIT-LIST CONTROL ARM AT THE 12-WEEK PRIMARY ASSESSMENT PERIOD. RESULTS FROM THIS STUDY WILL DETERMINE IF MBSR IS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR LOWERING BP IN EARLY UNMEDICATED HYPERTENSIVES. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: THIS RESEARCH PROJECT WAS APPROVED BY THE SUNNYBROOK RESEARCH ETHICS BOARD AND THE UNIVERSITY HEALTH NETWORK RESEARCH ETHICS BOARD (TORONTO, CANADA). PLANNED ANALYSES ARE IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE DECLARATION OF HELSINKI. DATA COLLECTION WILL BE COMPLETED BY EARLY SPRING 2012. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY ANALYSIS WILL COMMENCE IMMEDIATELY AFTER DATA MONITORING IS COMPLETED; DISSEMINATION PLANS INCLUDE PREPARING PUBLICATIONS FOR SUBMISSION DURING THE SUMMER OF 2012. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: THIS STUDY IS REGISTERED WITH HTTP://CLINICALTRIALS.GOV (NCT00825526).	2012	

12 1335  14 HOW DOES YOGA PRACTICE AND THERAPY YIELD PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFITS? A REVIEW AND MODEL OF TRANSDIAGNOSTIC PROCESSES. INTEREST IN YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING HAS INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS, WITH LITERATURE INVESTIGATING BENEFICIAL EFFECTS IN A VARIETY OF PRESENTATIONS AND SETTINGS. THE THEORETICAL UNDERSTANDING OF THIS BENEFIT HAS PREVIOUSLY FOCUSED ON PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES INVOLVED IN YOGA PRACTICE, HOWEVER INTEREST HAS TURNED TO THE POTENTIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL MECHANISMS ELICITING PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING. THE CURRENT PAPER BUILDS ON PREVIOUS THEORY AND ARGUES THAT YOGA PRACTICE TARGETS TRANSDIAGNOSTIC PSYCHOLOGICAL PROCESSES; MECHANISMS THAT FEATURE COMMONLY ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF PRESENTATIONS, THUS REDUCING DISTRESS AND INCREASING WELLBEING ACROSS CLINICAL AND NON-CLINICAL POPULATIONS. FEATURES OF YOGA PRACTICE ARE DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO THESE TRANSDIAGNOSTIC PROCESSES AND THE FEATURES OF MODERN TALKING THERAPIES. A NEW MODEL IS PROPOSED POSITING SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF YOGA PRACTICE CORRELATE WITH SPECIFIC TRANSDIAGNOSTIC PROCESSES TO ELICIT PSYCHOLOGICAL CHANGE AND ARGUES THAT THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH CHANGE OCCURS ARE DIRECTLY COMPARED WITH THE CHANGES OBSERVED IN TALKING THERAPIES. THE IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH AND THE POTENTIAL FOR THIS TO SUPPORT THE COMMISSIONING OF HOLISTIC APPROACHES IN CLINICAL PRACTICE ARE DISCUSSED.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
13 1371  21 IMPACT OF A YIN YOGA AND MEDITATION INTERVENTION ON PHARMACY FACULTY AND STUDENT WELL-BEING. BACKGROUND: STUDENT PHARMACISTS AND FACULTY EXHIBIT HIGH LEVELS OF STRESS, INDEPENDENT OF THE CURRENT CORONAVIRUS 2019 PANDEMIC, AND THEIR PATH TOWARD WELLNESS, INCLUDING A REDUCTION IN STRESS AND ANXIETY, IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE. YOGA AND MEDITATION ARE PROVEN INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE STRESS AND ANXIETY AND INCREASE WELLNESS. YIN YOGA IS AN ADAPTABLE, QUIET PRACTICE IDEAL FOR THOSE LACKING PREVIOUS YOGA EXPERIENCE, FLEXIBILITY, AND TIME. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF A 6-WEEK YIN YOGA AND MEDITATION INTERVENTION ON COLLEGE OF PHARMACY FACULTY AND STUDENTS' STRESS PERCEPTION, ANXIETY LEVELS, AND MINDFULNESS SKILLS. METHODS: FACULTY AND STUDENTS PARTICIPATED IN A 6-WEEK PILOT PROGRAM COMPRISING A ONCE-WEEKLY YIN YOGA CLASS FOLLOWED BY GUIDED MEDITATION. YIN YOGA WAS SELECTED FOR ITS QUIET MEDITATIVE STYLE. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED A PRE- AND POSTQUESTIONNAIRE AT 6 WEEKS AND 3 AND 6 MONTHS TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN PERCEIVED STRESS SCORES, ANXIETY SCORES, AND MINDFULNESS SKILLS. THE QUESTIONNAIRE WAS COMPOSED OF 3 SELF-REPORTING TOOLS: BECK ANXIETY INVENTORY (BAI), PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE, AND THE FIVE FACET MINDFULNESS QUESTIONNAIRE. RESULTS: TWENTY PARTICIPANTS, 12 STUDENTS AND 8 FACULTY (AGES 18-66 YEARS), COMPLETED THE STUDY. ANXIETY AND STRESS SCORES DECREASED, AND MINDFULNESS INCREASED AT 6 WEEKS, 3 MONTHS AND 6 MONTHS, WITH ALL CHANGES REACHING STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. NO PARTICIPANTS REPORTED BEING IN THE "HIGH" CATEGORY OF ANXIETY AFTER INTERVENTION USING BAI CATEGORICAL DATA, ALTHOUGH THIS FINDING WAS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. CONCLUSION: FACULTY AND STUDENTS DEMONSTRATED A REDUCTION IN STRESS AND ANXIETY LEVELS AND AN INCREASE IN MINDFULNESS AFTER A 6-WEEK YIN YOGA AND MEDITATION PROGRAM. OUTCOMES SUGGEST THAT INCLUSION OF AN ADAPTABLE, MEDITATIVE PRACTICE, WHICH MAY EASILY BE REPLICATED AT HOME, FOR AS LITTLE AS ONCE PER WEEK FOR 6 WEEKS MAY REDUCE STRESS AND ANXIETY AND INCREASE MINDFULNESS LONG TERM. CREATING A CULTURE OF WELLNESS SHOULD BE A PRIORITY FOR ALL COLLEGES OF PHARMACY.	2021	
                                                                                                             
14   96  21 A NATURALISTIC STUDY OF YOGA, MEDITATION, SELF-PERCEIVED STRESS, SELF-COMPASSION, AND MINDFULNESS IN COLLEGE STUDENTS. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY COMPARED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS MEDITATION ON SELF-COMPASSION, MINDFULNESS, AND PERCEIVED STRESS IN COLLEGE STUDENTS; AND EXPLORED MIND-BODY MECHANISMS AND PREDICTORS OF STRESS REDUCTION. PARTICIPANTS: STUDENT PARTICIPANTS (N = 92) WERE ENROLLED IN EITHER YOGA OR MINDFULNESS MEDITATION CLASSES AT A COLLEGE IN THE SOUTHERN UNITED STATES FROM AUGUST THROUGH MAY OF 2015-2016. METHODS: STUDENTS PARTICIPATED IN 50-MINUTE CLASSES TWICE A WEEK FOR 10 WEEKS, COMPLETING SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES DURING THE 1ST AND 10TH WEEK. RESULTS: MULTIPLE-LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS FOUND CHANGE IN SELF-COMPASSION WAS THE STRONGEST PREDICTOR OF STRESS REDUCTION. CONCLUSIONS: INCREASING SELF-COMPASSION MAY INCREASE THE EFFICACY OF MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS. RESEARCH INTO MIND-BODY MECHANISMS IS NEEDED TO IDENTIFY INTERVENTION COMPONENTS THAT MOST IMPROVE STUDENT WELL-BEING.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
15  303  25 AN EMPIRICAL COMPARISON OF MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF BRAIN SIGNALS TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF COMBINED YOGA AND SUDARSHAN KRIYA. TODAY'S FAST PACED LIFE REPORTS SO MUCH STRESS AMONG PEOPLE THAT IT MAY LEAD TO VARIOUS PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL ILLNESSES. YOGA AND MEDITATION ARE THE BEST STRATEGIES TO REDUCE THE EFFECT OF STRESS ON PHYSICAL AND MENTAL LEVEL WITHOUT ANY SIDE-EFFECTS. IN THIS STUDY, COMBINED YOGA AND SUDARSHAN KRIYA (SK) HAS BEEN USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF STRESS. THE AIM OF THE STUDY IS TO FIND A METHOD TO CLASSIFY THE MEDITATOR AND NON-MEDITATOR STATES WITH THE BEST ACCURACY. THE 50 SUBJECTS HAVE BEEN PARTICIPATING IN THIS STUDY AND DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS, I.E. STUDY AND CONTROL GROUP. THE SUBJECTS WITH REGULAR PRACTICE OF YOGA AND SK ARE KNOWN AS MEDITATORS AND THE ONES WITHOUT ANY PRACTICE OF YOGA AND MEDITATION WERE KNOWN AS NON-MEDITATORS. ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM (EEG) SIGNALS WERE ACQUIRED FROM THESE BOTH GROUPS BEFORE AND AFTER 3 MONTHS. THE STATISTICAL PARAMETERS WERE COMPUTED FROM THESE ACQUIRED EEG SIGNALS USING DISCRETE WAVELET TRANSFORM (DWT). THESE EXTRACTED STATISTICAL PARAMETERS WERE GIVEN AS INPUT TO THE CLASSIFIERS. THE DECISION TREE, DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS, LOGISTIC REGRESSION, SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM), WEIGHTED K- NEAREST NEIGHBOUR (KNN) AND ENSEMBLE CLASSIFIERS WERE USED FOR CLASSIFICATION OF MEDITATOR AND NON- MEDITATOR STATES FROM THE ACQUIRED EEG SIGNALS. THE RESULTS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THE SVM METHOD GIVES THE HIGHEST CLASSIFICATION ACCURACY AS COMPARED TO OTHER CLASSIFIERS. THE PROPOSED METHOD CAN BE USED AS A DIAGNOSIS SYSTEM IN CLINICAL PRACTICES.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
16  617  23 DEVELOPMENT OF SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF SPIRITUALITY DURING A 6-MONTH INTENSIVE YOGA PRACTICE. THE MAJORITY OF RESEARCH ON YOGA FOCUSES ON ITS PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL AND THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS, WHILE THE SPIRITUAL ASPECTS ARE RARELY ADDRESSED. CHANGES OF SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF SPIRITUALITY WERE THUS INVESTIGATED AMONG 160 INDIVIDUALS (91% WOMEN, MEAN AGE 40.9 +/- 8.3 YEARS; 57% CHRISTIANS) STARTING A 2-YEAR YOGA TEACHER TRAINING. WE USED STANDARDIZED QUESTIONNAIRES TO MEASURE ASPECTS OF SPIRITUALITY (ASP), MINDFULNESS (FMI-FREIBURG MINDFULNESS INVENTORY), LIFE SATISFACTION (BMLSS-BRIEF MULTIDIMENSIONAL LIFE SATISFACTION SCALE), AND POSITIVE MOOD (LIGHTHEARTEDNESS/RELIEF). AT THE START OF THE COURSE, SCORES OF THE RESPECTIVE ASP SUBSCALES FOR SEARCH FOR INSIGHT/WISDOM, TRANSCENDENCE CONVICTION, AND CONSCIOUS INTERACTIONS/COMPASSION WERE HIGH, WHILE THOSE FOR RELIGIOUS ORIENTATION WERE LOW. WITHIN THE 6 MONTH OBSERVATION PERIOD, BOTH CONSCIOUS INTERACTIONS/COMPASSION (EFFECT SIZE, COHEN'S D = .33), RELIGIOUS ORIENTATION (D = .21), LIGHTHEARTEDNESS/RELIEF (D = .75) AND MINDFULNESS (D = .53) INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. PARTICULARLY NON-RELIGIOUS/NON-SPIRITUAL INDIVIDUALS SHOWED MODERATE EFFECTS FOR AN INCREASE OF CONSCIOUS INTERACTIONS/COMPASSION. THE RESULTS FROM THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT AN INTENSIVE YOGA PRACTICE (1) MAY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF PRACTITIONERS' SPIRITUALITY, MINDFULNESS, AND MOOD, (2) THAT THESE CHANGES ARE DEPENDENT IN PART ON THEIR ORIGINAL SPIRITUAL/RELIGIOUS SELF-PERCEPTION, AND (3) THAT THERE ARE STRONG CORRELATIONS AMONGST THESE CONSTRUCTS (I.E., CONSCIOUS INTERACTIONS/COMPASSION, AND MINDFULNESS).	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
17 1964  16 SEPARATING THE "LIMBS" OF YOGA: LIMITED EFFECTS ON STRESS AND MOOD. THOUGH MILLIONS OF PEOPLE PRACTICE YOGA TO REDUCE STRESS AND IMPROVE THEIR MOOD, IT IS UNCLEAR WHICH ASPECT OF YOGA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE EFFECTS. TO INVESTIGATE RELEVANT ASPECTS, OR "LIMBS" OF YOGA, PARTICIPANTS WHO WERE NOVICES IN THE PRACTICE OF YOGA ENGAGED IN A SINGLE YOGA MANIPULATION (I.E., POSES, BREATH WORK, MEDITATION, OR LISTENING TO A LECTURE ABOUT YOGA) FOR 20 MIN BEFORE EXPERIENCING A MILD STRESSOR. PARTICIPANTS' HEART RATE, BLOOD PRESSURE, MOOD, AND ANXIETY LEVEL WERE ASSESSED, BOTH IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE YOGA MANIPULATION AND AFTER THE MILD STRESSOR. THE 20-MIN YOGA MANIPULATION DID NOT DIFFERENTIALLY AFFECT ANY OF THE MEASURES, INCLUDING PARTICIPANTS' STRESS RESPONSE AFTER THE MILD STRESSOR. RESULTS ARE DISCUSSED REGARDING THE INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS OF A YOGA PRACTICE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
18 1262  29 FIVE-WEEK YIN YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS DECREASED PLASMA ADRENOMEDULLIN AND INCREASED PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH IN STRESSED ADULTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES (NCDS, E.G. CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE) ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR HIGH RATES OF MORBIDITY AND THE MAJORITY OF PREMATURE DEATHS WORLDWIDE. IT IS NECESSARY TO DEVELOP PREVENTATIVE INTERVENTIONS THAT CAN REDUCE THE ASSOCIATED RISK FACTORS OF NCDS. RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT THE BIOMARKER ADRENOMEDULLIN (ADM) BECOMES ELEVATED YEARS BEFORE THE ONSET OF NCDS AND MIGHT PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THEIR DEVELOPMENT. ADM HAS ALSO BEEN LINKED TO PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS SUCH AS STRESS, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION, WHICH ARE KNOWN RISK FACTORS OF NCDS. IN THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, WE EXAMINED WHETHER PARTICIPATING IN A FIVE-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION REDUCES ADM AND INCREASES PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH IN MIDDLE-AGED ADULTS WHO SELF-REPORT AS MODERATELY TO HIGHLY STRESSED, BUT WHO OTHERWISE EXHIBIT NO PHYSICAL COMPLAINTS. METHODS: ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE ADULTS (78% WOMEN; MEAN AGE = 53.5, SD = 6.7) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO (1) A FIVE-WEEK YIN YOGA INTERVENTION, (2) A FIVE-WEEK INTERVENTION COMBINING YIN YOGA WITH PSYCHOEDUCATION AND MINDFULNESS PRACTICE (CALLED THE YOMI PROGRAM), OR (3) A CONTROL GROUP WHO DID NOT PRACTICE YOGA OR MINDFULNESS FOR FIVE WEEKS. RESULTS: COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP, WE OBSERVED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER PRE-POST REDUCTIONS IN PLASMA ADM LEVELS (P < .001), ANXIETY (P </= .002), AND SLEEP PROBLEMS (P </= .003) IN BOTH INTERVENTION GROUPS. FURTHERMORE, THE YOMI GROUP EXCLUSIVELY SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER PRE-POST REDUCTIONS IN STRESS (P = .012) AND DEPRESSION (P = .021) COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS (P < .05) WERE FOUND BETWEEN PRE-POST REDUCTIONS IN ADM AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS (P = .02) AND DEPRESSION (P = .04) IN THE ENTIRE SAMPLE. CONCLUSION: THE FIVE-WEEK YIN YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS APPEARED TO REDUCE BOTH THE PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL RISK FACTORS KNOWN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH NCDS. THE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT INCORPORATING YIN YOGA COULD BE AN EASY AND LOW-COST METHOD OF LIMITING THE NEGATIVE HEALTH EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH STRESS.

19  330  16 APPLICATION OF AN INTEGRATIVE YOGA THERAPY PROGRAMME IN CASES OF ESSENTIAL ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION IN PUBLIC HEALTHCARE. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE EFFICACY OF AN INTEGRATIVE YOGA PROGRAMME AS ADJUVANT TREATMENT OF ESSENTIAL ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION. METHODS: AN INTEGRATIVE YOGA PROGRAMME WAS CONDUCTED DURING THREE MONTHS IN 26 SESSIONS WITH A GROUP OF TEN ESSENTIAL ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION PATIENTS AT A PUBLIC HEALTH CENTRE. THE SAME NUMBER OF PATIENTS ACTED AS THE CONTROL GROUP WITHOUT TREATMENT. THE PATIENTS WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED AND ASSIGNED TO THE GROUPS. ALL PATIENTS FILLED IN THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECT SCHEDULE (PANAS), THE HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE (HADS) AND THE SMITH RELAXATION STATES INVENTORY 3 (SRSI3) BEFORE AND AFTER THE TREATMENT. RESULTS: A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE, NEGATIVE AFFECT, SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AND DEGREE OF STRESS COULD BE OBSERVED IN THE STUDY GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: THESE POSITIVE AND PROMISING RESULTS CONFIRM THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE TECHNIQUES IN THE TREATMENT OF ESSENTIAL ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION AND SUGGEST POSSIBLE FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
20  658  23 EFFECT OF 1-WEEK YOGA-BASED RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM ON CARDIOVASCULAR VARIABLES OF HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS: A COMPARATIVE STUDY. INTRODUCTION: HYPERTENSION (HTN) IS AN IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN AND A LEADING CAUSE OF MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY WORLDWIDE. YOGA IS A FORM OF MIND-BODY MEDICINE SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN CONTROLLING BLOOD PRESSURE (BP) AND REDUCES CARDIAC RISK FACTORS IN HTN. INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY (IAYT) IS A RESIDENTIAL YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION PROVEN TO BE BENEFICIAL IN SEVERAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. AIM: TO STUDY THE EFFICACY OF 1 WEEK OF RESIDENTIAL IAYT INTERVENTION ON CARDIOVASCULAR PARAMETERS IN HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS. METHODOLOGY: TWENTY HYPERTENSIVE INDIVIDUALS (7 FEMALES) WITHIN AGE RANGE BETWEEN 30 AND 60 YEARS (AVERAGE; 46.62 +/- 9.9 YEARS), WHO UNDERWENT 1 WEEK OF IAYT TREATMENT FOR HTN, WERE COMPARED WITH AGE- GENDER-MATCHED NON-IAYT GROUP (5 FEMALES; AVERAGE AGE; 47.08 +/- 9.69 YEARS) IN TERMS OF SYSTOLIC BP (SBP), DIASTOLIC BP (DBP), MEAN ARTERIAL PRESSURE (MAP), CARDIAC OUTPUT (CO), STROKE VOLUME (SV), BAROREFLEX SENSITIVITY (BRS), AND TOTAL PERIPHERAL VASCULAR RESISTANCE (TPVR), IAYT PROGRAM CONSISTED OF SESSIONS OF ASANAS, BREATHING PRACTICES, MEDITATION AND RELAXATION TECHNIQUES, LOW SALT, LOW-CALORIE DIET, DEVOTIONAL SESSION, AND COUNSELING. INDIVIDUALS IN NON-IAYT GROUP FOLLOWED THEIR NORMAL ROUTINE. ALL THE VARIABLES WERE ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER ONE WEEK. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING SPSS VERSION 16. RM-ANOVA WAS APPLIED TO ASSESS WITHIN GROUP AND BETWEEN GROUP CHANGES AFTER INTERVENTION. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SBP (P = 0.004), DBP (P = 0.008), MAP (0.03), BRS (P < 0.001), AND TPVR (P = 0.007) IN IAYT, GROUP WHEREAS IN CONTROL GROUP, WE DID NOT FIND SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN ANY OF THE VARIABLES. BETWEEN-GROUP COMPARISON SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SBP (P = 0.038), BRS (P = 0.034), AND TPVR (P = 0.015) IN IAYT GROUP AS COMPARED TO NON-IAYT GROUP. CONCLUSION: ONE-WEEK IAYT INTERVENTION SHOWED AN IMPROVEMENT IN BAROREFLEX SENSITIVITY, SYSTOLIC BP, AND TOTAL PERIPHERAL VASCULAR RESISTANCE IN HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS. HOWEVER, FURTHER RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS NEED TO BE PERFORMED TO CONFIRM THE PRESENT FINDINGS.	2018

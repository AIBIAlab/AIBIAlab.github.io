1  172 141 A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY OF YOGA SKILLS TRAINING VERSUS AN ATTENTION CONTROL DELIVERED DURING CHEMOTHERAPY ADMINISTRATION. CONTEXT: IT IS IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS FATIGUE AND CO-OCCURRING SYMPTOMS DURING CHEMOTHERAPY TO PRESERVE QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH GASTROINTESTINAL (GI) CANCER. OBJECTIVE: TO CONDUCT A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY OF A YOGA SKILLS TRAINING (YST) INTERVENTION COMPARED TO AN ATTENTION CONTROL (AC) AMONG ADULTS DIAGNOSED WITH GI CANCER. METHODS: YST CONSISTED OF FOUR 30-MINUTE SESSIONS DELIVERED INDIVIDUALLY DURING CHEMOTHERAPY PLUS HOME PRACTICE. AC PROVIDED EMPATHIC ATTENTION PLUS HOME DIARIES. PATIENT-REPORTED (PROMIS T-SCORE) ASSESSMENTS OF FATIGUE, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, SLEEP DISTURBANCES, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS (PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE) WERE COLLECTED AT CHEMOTHERAPY VISITS: BASELINE, WEEK 8, WEEK 10 AND WEEK 14, AND ANALYZED USING A MIXED EFFECTS MODEL. INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND WEEK 10. RESULTS: FORTY-FOUR OF 77 ADULTS APPROACHED AGREED TO PARTICIPATE (57%; YST N = 23; AC N = 21). PARTICIPANTS' MEAN AGE WAS 58 YEARS AND 48% WERE MEN. PARTICIPANTS RANDOMIZED TO YST REPORTED A LARGER DECLINE IN FATIGUE (-2.4 DIFFERENCE, D = 0.30) AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (-2.5 DIFFERENCE, D = 0.30) THAN AC PARTICIPANTS FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 10 AND SLEEP DISTURBANCES AT WEEK 8 (-3.9 DIFFERENCE, D = 0.50). DIFFERENCES IN MAGNITUDE OF CHANGE IN SYMPTOMS WERE CONSISTENT WITH OR EXCEEDED A MINIMALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE. PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS DECREASED MORE IN THE AC AT WEEK 10 (D = 0.30). REDUCTIONS IN INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES (IL-6, STNF R1) WERE LARGER IN THE YST GROUP THAN AC. CONCLUSION: YST SHOWED PROMISE FOR IMPROVING FATIGUE, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, SLEEP DISTURBANCES, AND INFLAMMATION. YST IS ALSO FEASIBLE AND REACHES PATIENTS UNDERREPRESENTED IN YOGA RESEARCH (I.E., GI CANCER, MEN), THUS WARRANTING FURTHER EXAMINATION.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
2 1237  44 FEASIBILITY OF A BRIEF YOGA INTERVENTION FOR IMPROVING ACUTE PAIN AND DISTRESS POST GYNECOLOGIC SURGERY. BACKGROUND: WOMEN UNDERGOING SURGICAL PROCEDURES FOR SUSPECTED GYNECOLOGIC MALIGNANCIES FREQUENTLY EXPERIENCE PAIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS RELATED TO SURGERY. YOGA MAY REDUCE THESE NEGATIVE SURGICAL OUTCOMES. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF EVALUATING A PERIOPERATIVE BRIEF YOGA SKILLS TRAINING (YST) IN THIS POPULATION. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES WERE TO (1) ASSESS THE IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF THE YST ON PAIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS; AND (2) PROVIDE PRELIMINARY DATA FOR FUTURE STUDIES. METHOD: ADULT WOMEN SCHEDULED TO UNDERGO AN EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY FOR A SUSPECTED GYNECOLOGIC MALIGNANCY WERE RECRUITED TO THIS ONE-ARM FEASIBILITY STUDY. EACH WOMAN RECEIVED THE YST, WHICH CONSISTED OF THREE 15-MINUTE SESSIONS, ONE BEFORE AND TWO AFTER SURGERY. THE FOLLOWING CONSTRUCTS WERE ASSESSED: FEASIBILITY (RATES OF ACCRUAL, INTERVENTION ADHERENCE, MEASURE COMPLETION, RETENTION, AND LEVEL OF SATISFACTION), IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF THE YST (VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE RATINGS OF PAIN AND DISTRESS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND AFTER EACH SESSION), AND DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS FOR MEASURES TO BE USED IN FUTURE STUDIES. RESULTS: OF THE 33 ELIGIBLE WOMEN, 18 WERE APPROACHED AND 10 AGREED TO PARTICIPATE (MEAN AGE = 54.7 YEARS; 90% WHITE). TWO WOMEN DISCONTINUED THE STUDY PRIOR TO STARTING THE YST SESSIONS. OF THE EIGHT PARTICIPANTS WHO RECEIVED THE YST, FIVE COMPLETED THE PRE-SURGERY SESSION (63%) AND SEVEN COMPLETED (88%) BOTH POST-SURGICAL SESSIONS; ONE WOMAN WITHDREW AFTER ONE YST SESSION. PARTICIPANTS REPORTED HIGH SATISFACTION WITH THE YST. ACUTE PAIN AND DISTRESS DECREASED FROM BEFORE TO IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE YST SESSION WITH MODERATE TO LARGE EFFECTS: PAIN, D'S = -0.67 TO -0.95; DISTRESS, D'S = -0.66 TO -1.08. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATED REASONABLE INDICATORS OF FEASIBILITY. IN ADDITION, PATIENTS SHOWED SHORT-TERM REDUCTIONS IN PAIN AND DISTRESS. NEXT STEPS INCLUDE ATTENTION TO IMPROVING STAFF AVAILABILITY AND INTERVENTION IMPLEMENTATION IN ORDER TO FEASIBLY EVALUATE THE PERIOPERATIVE YST, WHICH SHOWS PROMISE FOR REDUCING POSTOPERATIVE PAIN AND DISTRESS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
3   41  61 A BRIEF YOGA INTERVENTION IMPLEMENTED DURING CHEMOTHERAPY: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVES: FATIGUE AND OTHER TREATMENT-RELATED SYMPTOMS (E.G., SLEEP DISTURBANCE) ARE CRITICAL TARGETS FOR IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY. YOGA MAY REDUCE THE BURDEN OF SUCH SYMPTOMS. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE FEASIBILITY OF CONDUCTING A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY OF A BRIEF YOGA INTERVENTION DURING CHEMOTHERAPY FOR COLORECTAL CANCER. DESIGN: WE RANDOMIZED ADULTS WITH COLORECTAL CANCER TO A BRIEF YOGA SKILLS TRAINING (YST) OR AN ATTENTION CONTROL (AC; EMPATHIC ATTENTION AND RECORDED EDUCATION). SETTING: THE INTERVENTIONS AND ASSESSMENTS WERE IMPLEMENTED INDIVIDUALLY IN THE CLINIC WHILE PATIENTS WERE IN THE CHAIR RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY. INTERVENTIONS: BOTH INTERVENTIONS CONSISTED OF THREE SESSIONS AND RECOMMENDED HOME PRACTICE. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS FEASIBILITY (ACCRUAL, RETENTION, ADHERENCE, DATA COLLECTION). SELF-REPORTED OUTCOMES (I.E., FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, QUALITY OF LIFE) AND INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS WERE ALSO DESCRIBED TO INFORM FUTURE STUDIES. RESULTS: OF 52 PATIENTS INITIALLY IDENTIFIED, 28 WERE APPROACHED, AND 15 ENROLLED (AGE MEAN = 57.5 YEARS; 80% WHITE; 60% MALE). REASONS FOR DECLINING PARTICIPATION WERE: NOT INTERESTED (N = 6), DID NOT PERCEIVE A NEED (N = 2), AND OTHER (N = 5). TWO PARTICIPANTS WERE LOST TO FOLLOW-UP IN EACH GROUP DUE TO TREATMENT CHANGES. THUS, 75% OF PARTICIPANTS WERE RETAINED IN THE YST AND 71% IN THE AC ARM. PARTICIPANTS RETAINED IN THE STUDY ADHERED TO 97% OF THE IN-PERSON INTERVENTION SESSIONS AND COMPLETED ALL QUESTIONNAIRES. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATED THE FEASIBILITY OF CONDUCTING A LARGER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL TO ASSESS YST AMONG PATIENTS RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY FOR COLORECTAL CANCER. DATA COLLECTED AND CHALLENGES ENCOUNTERED WILL INFORM FUTURE RESEARCH.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
4 1495  42 INTERVENTION PROTOCOL FOR INVESTIGATING YOGA IMPLEMENTED DURING CHEMOTHERAPY. OBJECTIVE: FATIGUE AND OTHER TREATMENT-RELATED SYMPTOMS ARE CRITICAL THERAPEUTIC TARGETS FOR IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH COLORECTAL CANCER DURING CHEMOTHERAPY. YOGA IS A PROMISING INTERVENTION FOR IMPROVING THESE THERAPEUTIC TARGETS AND HAS BEEN PRIMARILY INVESTIGATED IN THE GROUP-CLASS FORMAT, WHICH IS LESS FEASIBLE FOR CANCER PATIENTS WITH HIGH SYMPTOM BURDEN TO ATTEND. THUS, WE DEVELOPED A PROTOCOL FOR IMPLEMENTING YOGA INDIVIDUALLY IN THE CLINIC AMONG PATIENTS RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY. METHODS: WE FOLLOWED RECOMMENDED DOMAINS FOR DEVELOPING A YOGA PROTOCOL TO BE USED IN AN EFFICACY TRIAL. THESE RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE CONSIDERATION TO THE STYLE, DELIVERY, COMPONENTS OF THE INTERVENTION, DOSE, SPECIFIC CLASS SEQUENCES, FACILITATION OF HOME PRACTICE, MEASUREMENT OF INTERVENTION FIDELITY, SELECTION OF INSTRUCTORS, AND DEALING WITH MODIFICATIONS. THE INTERVENTION PROTOCOL WAS DEVELOPED BY AN INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM. PROTOCOL: YOGA SKILLS TRAINING (YST) CONSISTS OF FOUR 30-MINUTE IN-PERSON SESSIONS AND WAS IMPLEMENTED WHILE IN THE CHAIR DURING CHEMOTHERAPY INFUSIONS FOR COLORECTAL CANCER WITH RECOMMENDED DAILY HOME PRACTICE FOR EIGHT WEEKS. THERAPEUTIC GOALS OF THE YST ARE TO REDUCE FATIGUE, CIRCADIAN DISRUPTION, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. ELEMENTS OF THE YST ARE AWARENESS MEDITATION, GENTLE SEATED MOVEMENT, BREATHING PRACTICE, AND RELAXATION MEDITATION. ATTENTION, COMFORT, AND EASE ARE ALSO HIGHLIGHTED. CONCLUSION: THIS DESCRIPTION OF A PROTOCOL FOR INTEGRATING YOGA WITH CONVENTIONAL CANCER TREATMENT WILL INFORM FUTURE STUDY DESIGNS AND CLINICAL PRACTICE. THE DESIGN OF THE YST IS NOVEL BECAUSE IT IMPLEMENTS YOGA-MOST COMMONLY STUDIED WHEN TAUGHT TO GROUPS OUTSIDE OF THE CLINICAL SETTING- INDIVIDUALLY DURING CLINICAL CARE.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
5  551  40 CONVENIENT AND LIVE MOVEMENT (CALM) FOR WOMEN UNDERGOING BREAST CANCER TREATMENT: CHALLENGES AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INTERNET-BASED YOGA RESEARCH. OBJECTIVE: TO CONDUCT A PILOT TRIAL OF INTERNET-BASED, CANCER-ADAPTED YOGA FOR WOMEN RECEIVING BREAST CANCER TREATMENT. DESIGN: WOMEN UNDERGOING RADIATION OR CHEMOTHERAPY FOR BREAST CANCER WERE RECRUITED FOR 12, 75-MIN, BIWEEKLY, CANCER-ADAPTED YOGA CLASSES DELIVERED VIA INTERNET-BASED, MULTIPOINT VIDEOCONFERENCING. DATA WERE COLLECTED ON FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY, INCLUDING QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK FROM PARTICIPANTS AND THE YOGA INSTRUCTOR. RESULTS: AMONG 42 WOMEN APPROACHED, 13 DECLINED ELIGIBILITY SCREENING, AND 23 WERE INELIGIBLE. ALL 6 WOMEN WHO WERE ELIGIBLE PROVIDED CONSENT, BUT 2 WITHDREW PRIOR TO BEGINNING YOGA CLASSES. THE REMAINING 4 PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED 1-11 OF 12 ONLINE YOGA CLASSES. IN POST-INTERVENTION INTERVIEWS, PARTICIPANTS AND THE INSTRUCTOR AGREED THAT INTERNET-BASED YOGA CLASSES HOLD GREAT POTENTIAL FOR INCREASING ACCESS AND IMPROVING PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES IN ADULTS WITH CANCER. QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK FROM PARTICIPANTS REVEALED SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE TRIALS OF INTERNET-BASED, CANCER-ADAPTED YOGA CLASSES, INCLUDING: CONTINUED USE OF GROUP FORMAT; OFFERING MORE VARIED CLASS TIMES TO ACCOMMODATE PATIENTS' DEMANDING SCHEDULES AND FLUCTUATING SYMPTOMS; ENROLLING PATIENTS AFTER THEY HAVE ACCLIMATED TO OR COMPLETED CANCER TREATMENT; STREAMLINING THE TECHNOLOGY INTERFACE; AND CAREFUL ATTENTION TO PARTICIPANT BURDEN WHEN DESIGNING SURVEYS/FORMS. THE INSTRUCTOR RECOMMENDED CLOSED SESSION COURSES, AS OPPOSED TO ROLLING ENROLLMENT; TEACHING THE SAME MODIFIED POSES FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS, RATHER THAN INDIVIDUAL TAILORING; AND USING A LARGE SCREEN TO ALLOW CLOSER MONITORING OF STUDENTS' CLASS EXPERIENCE. CONCLUSIONS: INTERNET DELIVERY MAY INCREASE PATIENTS' ACCESS TO CANCER-ADAPTED YOGA CLASSES, BUT CANCER-RELATED AND TECHNOLOGICAL BARRIERS REMAIN. THIS STUDY INFORMS HOW TO OPTIMALLY DESIGN YOGA CLASSES, TECHNOLOGY, AND RESEARCH PROCEDURES TO MAXIMIZE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY IN FUTURE TRIALS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
6 1748  43 PILOT RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL OF A DYADIC YOGA PROGRAM FOR GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS. BACKGROUND: WHILE THE USE OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE IN MANAGING GLIOMA PATIENTS' SYMPTOMS IS NOT WELL STUDIED, THE HIGH SYMPTOM BURDEN IN PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS IS WELL ESTABLISHED. WE CONDUCTED A PILOT RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF A DYADIC YOGA (DY) INTERVENTION AS A SUPPORTIVE CARE STRATEGY. METHODS: GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 12-SESSION DY OR WAITLIST CONTROL (WLC) GROUP. PRIOR TO RADIOTHERAPY AND RANDOMIZATION, BOTH GROUPS COMPLETED MEASURES OF CANCER-RELATED SYMPTOMS (MD ANDERSON SYMPTOM INVENTORY-BRAIN TUMOR MODULE), DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (CENTER FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES-DEPRESSION MEASURE), FATIGUE (BRIEF FATIGUE INVENTORY), AND OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL; MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY 36-ITEM SHORT-FORM SURVEY). DYADS WERE REASSESSED AT THE LAST DAY OF RADIOTHERAPY. RESULTS: TWENTY PATIENTS (MEAN AGE: 46 YEARS, 50% FEMALE, 80% WHO GRADE IV AND CAREGIVERS (MEAN AGE: 50 YEARS, 70% FEMALE, 50% SPOUSES) PARTICIPATED IN THE TRIAL. A PRIORI FEASIBILITY CRITERIA WERE MET REGARDING CONSENT (70%), ADHERENCE (88%), AND RETENTION (95%) RATES. CONTROLLING FOR RELEVANT COVARIATES, CHANGE SCORE ANALYSES REVEALED CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS FOR PATIENTS IN THE DY COMPARED WITH THE WLC GROUP FOR OVERALL CANCER SYMPTOM SEVERITY (D = 0.96) AND SYMPTOM INTERFERENCE (D = 0.74), DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (D = 0.71), AND MENTAL QOL (D = 0.69). CAREGIVERS IN THE DY GROUP REPORTED CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (D = 1.12), FATIGUE (D = 0.89), AND MENTAL QOL (D = 0.49) RELATIVE TO THOSE IN THE WLC GROUP. CONCLUSION: A DY INTERVENTION APPEARS TO BE A FEASIBLE AND BENEFICIAL SYMPTOM AND QOL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. AN EFFICACY TRIAL WITH A MORE STRINGENT CONTROL GROUP IS WARRANTED.

7  127  40 A PILOT STUDY TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF INDIVIDUALIZED YOGA FOR INPATIENT CHILDREN RECEIVING INTENSIVE CHEMOTHERAPY. BACKGROUND: FATIGUE IS AN IMPORTANT PROBLEM IN PAEDIATRIC CANCER PATIENTS AND YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE WAS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF INDIVIDUALIZED YOGA FOR HOSPITALIZED CHILDREN RECEIVING INTENSIVE CHEMOTHERAPY. METHODS: WE INCLUDED ENGLISH-SPEAKING CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS AGED 7-18 YEARS RECEIVING INTENSIVE CHEMOTHERAPY OR HAEMATOPOIETIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION (HSCT). YOGA WAS CONDUCTED THREE TIMES WEEKLY FOR THREE WEEKS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS FEASIBILITY, DEFINED AS ABILITY TO DELIVER AT LEAST 60% OF PLANNED SESSIONS. SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE PARENT-REPORTED PEDIATRIC QUALITY OF LIFE INVENTORY (PEDSQL) MULTIDIMENSIONAL FATIGUE SCALE, FATIGUE SCALE-PARENT, PEDSQL GENERIC CORE SCALES AND PEDSQL ACUTE CANCER MODULE. RESULTS: BETWEEN JANUARY AND OCTOBER 2013, 11 PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED. MEDIAN AGE WAS 14.0 (RANGE 7.7-16.4) YEARS AND 6 (55%) WERE BOYS. YOGA WAS FEASIBLE WITH 10/11 PARTICIPANTS MEETING THE THRESHOLD FOR FEASIBILITY. THE MEDIAN NUMBER OF YOGA SESSIONS WAS 9 (RANGE 3-13). NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE ATTRIBUTED TO YOGA.

8  945  48 EFFECTS OF A 12-WEEK YOGA VERSUS A 12-WEEK EDUCATIONAL FILM INTERVENTION ON SYMPTOMS OF RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME AND RELATED OUTCOMES: AN EXPLORATORY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. STUDY OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA VERSUS EDUCATIONAL FILM (EF) PROGRAM ON RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS) SYMPTOMS AND RELATED OUTCOMES IN ADULTS WITH RLS. METHODS: FORTY-ONE COMMUNITY-DWELLING, AMBULATORY NONPREGNANT ADULTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE RLS WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 12-WEEK YOGA (N = 19) OR EF PROGRAM (N = 22). IN ADDITION TO ATTENDING CLASSES, ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED PRACTICE/TREATMENT LOGS. YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO PRACTICE AT HOME 30 MINUTES PER DAY ON NONCLASS DAYS; EF PARTICIPANTS WERE INSTRUCTED TO RECORD ANY RLS TREATMENTS USED ON THEIR DAILY LOGS. CORE OUTCOMES ASSESSED PRETREATMENT AND POSTTREATMENT WERE RLS SYMPTOMS AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY (INTERNATIONAL RLS STUDY GROUP SCALE (IRLS) AND RLS ORDINAL SCALE), SLEEP QUALITY, MOOD, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). RESULTS: THIRTY ADULTS (13 YOGA, 17 EF), AGED 24 TO 73 (MEAN = 50.4 +/- 2.4 YEARS), COMPLETED THE 12-WEEK STUDY (78% FEMALE, 80.5% WHITE). POST-INTERVENTION, BOTH GROUPS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN RLS SYMPTOMS AND SEVERITY, PERCEIVED STRESS, MOOD, AND QOL-MENTAL HEALTH (P </= .04). RELATIVE TO THE EF GROUP, YOGA PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER REDUCTIONS IN RLS SYMPTOMS AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY (P </= .01), AND GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN PERCEIVED STRESS AND MOOD (P </= .04), AS WELL AS SLEEP QUALITY (P = .09); RLS SYMPTOMS DECREASED TO MINIMAL/MILD IN 77% OF YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS, WITH NONE SCORING IN THE SEVERE RANGE BY WEEK 12, VERSUS 24% AND 12%, RESPECTIVELY, IN EF PARTICIPANTS. IN THE YOGA GROUP, IRLS AND RLS SEVERITY SCORES DECLINED WITH INCREASING MINUTES OF HOMEWORK PRACTICE (R = .7, P = .009 AND R = .6, P = .03, RESPECTIVELY), SUGGESTING A POSSIBLE DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS OF THIS EXPLORATORY RCT SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING RLS SYMPTOMS AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY, DECREASING PERCEIVED STRESS, AND IMPROVING MOOD AND SLEEP IN ADULTS WITH RLS.

9  199  36 A RESEARCH PROTOCOL FOR A PILOT, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL DESIGNED TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF A DYADIC VERSUS INDIVIDUAL YOGA PROGRAM FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS OF GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY. BACKGROUND: ALTHOUGH THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF A PRIMARY BRAIN TUMOR PRESENT UNIQUE CHALLENGES TO PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS, EVIDENCE-BASED SUPPORTIVE CARE INTERVENTIONS ARE GENERALLY LACKING. THE PRIMARY AIM OF THIS RESEARCH PROTOCOL IS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING A DYADIC YOGA (DY) VERSUS A CAREGIVER YOGA (CY) INTERVENTION OR A WAIT-LIST CONTROL (WLC) GROUP USING A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL DESIGN. METHODS: SEVENTY-FIVE GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS ARE RANDOMIZED TO THE DY, CY, OR A WLC GROUP. PATIENT-CAREGIVER DYADS IN THE DY GROUP AND CAREGIVERS IN THE CY GROUP RECEIVE 15 SESSIONS (45 MIN EACH) OVER THE COURSE OF PATIENTS' STANDARD RADIOTHERAPY (6 WEEKS). PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS IN ALL GROUPS COMPLETE BASELINE ASSESSMENTS OF SYMPTOMS, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), AND HEALTH UTILIZATION OUTCOMES PRIOR TO RANDOMIZATION. FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENTS ARE PERFORMED 6 WEEKS AND THEN AGAIN 3 MONTHS LATER. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME IS FEASIBILITY (I.E., >/= 50% OF ELIGIBLE DYADS CONSENT, >/= 70% OF ENROLLED DYADS COMPLETE ALL ASSESSMENTS, AND >/= 50% OF ALL PRACTICE SESSIONS ARE ATTENDED). WE WILL ALSO PERFORM PRIMARILY DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSES OF THE SELF-REPORTED OUTCOMES (E.G., FATIGUE, OVERALL QOL) AND EXPLORE POTENTIAL INTERVENTION MODERATORS (E.G., PERFORMANCE STATUS) TO INFORM A LARGER FUTURE TRIAL. CONCLUSION: THIS TRIAL WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING THE FEASIBILITY OF A DYADIC VERSUS A CAREGIVER YOGA INTERVENTION REGARDING SYMPTOM, QOL, AND HEALTH UTILIZATION OUTCOMES IN GLIOMA PATIENTS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS.

10  312  37 AN EXPLORATORY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF A 12-WEEK YOGA VERSUS EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME: FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY. OBJECTIVES: THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF THIS PILOT TRIAL WERE TO ASSESS THE STUDY FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF THE 12-WEEK YOGA AND EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAMS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS) IN PREPARATION FOR A FUTURE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS PILOT, PARALLEL-ARM, RANDOMIZED FEASIBILITY TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED AT TWO SITES, MORGANTOWN, WV AND COLUMBUS, OH. YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED 75-MIN IYENGAR YOGA CLASSES, TWICE WEEKLY FOR 4 WEEKS, THEN ONCE A WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS (16 TOTAL CLASSES), AND COMPLETED A 30-MIN HOMEWORK ROUTINE ON NONCLASS DAYS. EDUCATIONAL FILM GROUP PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED ONCE WEEKLY, 75-MIN CLASSES (12 TOTAL CLASSES), WHICH INCLUDED INFORMATION ON RLS AND OTHER SLEEP DISORDERS, RLS MANAGEMENT INCLUDING SLEEP HYGIENE PRACTICES, AND COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES. FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OUTCOMES INCLUDED PROGRAM SATISFACTION AND RECRUITMENT, RETENTION, AND ADHERENCE RATES. IN ADDITION, PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED THEIR PREFERENCES REGARDING THREE YOGA CLASS SCHEDULE SCENARIOS FOR A FUTURE STUDY. ATTENDANCE, YOGA, AND TREATMENT LOGS WERE COLLECTED WEEKLY. PROGRAM EVALUATION AND YOGA SCHEDULING QUESTIONNAIRES WERE COLLECTED AT WEEK 12. RESULTS: FORTY-ONE ADULTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE RLS WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 12-WEEK YOGA (N = 19) OR EDUCATIONAL FILM (N = 22) PROGRAM. THIRTY PARTICIPANTS (73%) COMPLETED THE PROGRAM. YOGA AND EDUCATION GROUP PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED AN AVERAGE OF 13.0 +/- 0.84 (81%) AND 10.3 +/- 0.3 CLASSES (85%), RESPECTIVELY. PARTICIPANTS FROM BOTH GROUPS INDICATED SATISFACTION WITH THE STUDY. ALL YOGA GROUP RESPONDENTS TO THE PROGRAM EVALUATION REPORTED THEY WOULD LIKELY (N = 6) OR VERY LIKELY (N = 7) CONTINUE YOGA PRACTICE; 86.7% OF EDUCATION GROUP RESPONDENTS (13 OF 15) INDICATED THAT THEY WERE LIKELY (N = 7) OR VERY LIKELY (N = 6) TO MAKE LASTING CHANGES BASED ON WHAT THEY HAD LEARNED. THE PREFERRED SCHEDULE FOR A FUTURE STUDY WAS A 16-WEEK STUDY WITH ONCE-WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES. CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT A LARGER RCT COMPARING YOGA WITH AN EDUCATIONAL FILM GROUP FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RLS IS FEASIBLE.

11  258  39 ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF A 12-WEEK YOGA VS. EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS): STUDY PROTOCOL FOR A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS) IS A COMMON AND BURDENSOME SLEEP DISORDER ASSOCIATED WITH PROFOUND IMPAIRMENT OF HEALTH, WELL-BEING, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. UNFORTUNATELY, THE MEDICATIONS USED FOR RLS MANAGEMENT CARRY RISK OF SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS, INCLUDING AUGMENTATION OF SYMPTOMS. YOGA, AN ANCIENT MIND-BODY DISCIPLINE DESIGNED TO PROMOTE PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, AND MENTAL WELL-BEING, MAY OFFER A VIABLE, LOW-RISK NEW TREATMENT. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF THIS PILOT, PARALLEL-ARM, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) ARE TO ASSESS THE ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF A 12-WEEK YOGA VS. EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RLS. METHODS: FORTY-FOUR ADULTS WITH CONFIRMED MODERATE TO SEVERE RLS WILL BE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED TO A 12-WEEK YOGA (N = 22) OR STANDARDIZED EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM (N = 22). YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS WILL ATTEND TWO 75-MIN IYENGAR YOGA CLASSES PER WEEK FOR THE FIRST 4 WEEKS, THEN ONE 75-MIN CLASS PER WEEK FOR THE REMAINING 8 WEEKS, AND WILL COMPLETE A 30-MIN HOMEWORK ROUTINE ON NON-CLASS DAYS. EDUCATIONAL FILM GROUP PARTICIPANTS WILL ATTEND ONE 75-MIN CLASS PER WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS AND COMPLETE A DAILY RLS TREATMENT LOG; CLASSES WILL INCLUDE INFORMATION ON: RLS MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING SLEEP HYGIENE PRACTICES; OTHER SLEEP DISORDERS; AND COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES LIKELY TO BE OF INTEREST TO THOSE PARTICIPATING IN A YOGA AND SLEEP EDUCATION STUDY. YOGA AND TREATMENT LOGS WILL BE COLLECTED WEEKLY. FEASIBILITY OUTCOMES WILL INCLUDE RECRUITMENT, ENROLLMENT, AND RANDOMIZATION RATES, RETENTION, ADHERENCE, AND PROGRAM SATISFACTION. PROGRAM EVALUATION AND YOGA-DOSING QUESTIONNAIRES WILL BE COLLECTED AT WEEK 12; DATA ON EXPLORATORY OUTCOMES (E.G., RLS SYMPTOM SEVERITY (IRLS), SLEEP QUALITY (PSQI), MOOD (POMS, PSS), AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (SF-36)) WILL BE GATHERED AT BASELINE AND WEEK 12. DISCUSSION: THIS STUDY WILL LAY THE ESSENTIAL GROUNDWORK FOR A PLANNED LARGER RCT TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF A YOGA PROGRAM FOR REDUCING SYMPTOMS AND ASSOCIATED BURDEN OF RLS. IF THE FINDINGS OF THE CURRENT TRIAL AND THE SUBSEQUENT LARGER RCTS ARE POSITIVE, THIS STUDY WILL ALSO HELP SUPPORT A NEW APPROACH TO CLINICAL TREATMENT OF THIS CHALLENGING DISORDER, HELP FOSTER IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF RLS ETIOLOGY, AND ULTIMATELY CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCING THE INDIVIDUAL, SOCIETAL, AND ECONOMIC BURDEN ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CONDITION.

12   70  42 A FEASIBILITY STUDY EXAMINING THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON PSYCHOSOCIAL HEALTH AND SYMPTOMS IN PEDIATRIC OUTPATIENTS RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY. PURPOSE: PEDIATRIC CANCER PATIENTS EXPERIENCE SYMPTOMS THAT NEGATIVELY IMPACT QUALITY OF LIFE; YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE WAS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF A 10-WEEK, WEEKLY INDIVIDUALIZED YOGA INTERVENTION FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS RECEIVING OUTPATIENT CANCER THERAPY PRIMARILY DELIVERED REMOTELY USING SKYPE. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES WERE TO DESCRIBE DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, ANGER, FATIGUE, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND SYMPTOMS AT 5 AND 10 WEEKS AFTER ENROLLMENT. METHODS: WE INCLUDED ENGLISH-SPEAKING PATIENTS AGED 10 TO 18 YEARS RECEIVING OUTPATIENT CHEMOTHERAPY FOR CANCER. WEEKLY INDIVIDUALIZED YOGA SESSIONS WERE OFFERED FOR 10 WEEKS. WEEKS 1, 5, AND 10 WERE IN-HOSPITAL WHILE THE REMAINING SESSIONS WERE DELIVERED REMOTELY USING SKYPE. TWICE WEEKLY, HOMEWORK WAS ASSIGNED BETWEEN EACH SESSION. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS FEASIBILITY, DEFINED AS 80% OF PARTICIPANTS COMPLETING AT LEAST 60% OF PLANNED IN-HOSPITAL OR REMOTE YOGA SESSIONS. RESULTS: BETWEEN MARCH AND NOVEMBER 2017, 10 PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED. TWO PATIENTS DISCONTINUED THE STUDY AFTER ONE AND TWO SESSIONS. ONLY SIX PARTICIPANTS ACHIEVED AT LEAST 60% OF PLANNED YOGA SESSIONS AND THUS, THE STUDY DID NOT MEET THE A PRIORI DEFINED FEASIBILITY THRESHOLD. AMONG ALL PARTICIPANTS, ONLY ONE HOMEWORK SESSION WAS PERFORMED. CONCLUSIONS: A 10-WEEK INDIVIDUALIZED IN-PERSON AND REMOTELY CONDUCTED YOGA INTERVENTION WAS NOT FEASIBLE IN CHILDREN RECEIVING CANCER TREATMENTS BECAUSE OF FAILURE TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED FREQUENCY OF YOGA SESSIONS IN A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD IDENTIFY APPROACHES TO IMPROVE COMPLIANCE WITH REMOTE YOGA SESSIONS AND HOME PRACTICE.

13 1331  43 HOME-BASED YOGA PROGRAM FOR THE PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM MALIGNANT LYMPHOMA DURING CHEMOTHERAPY: A FEASIBILITY STUDY. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS PROVEN BENEFICIAL IN IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY, BUT ITS EFFECTIVENESS IN LYMPHOMA PATIENTS NEEDS TO BE EXPLORED. AS CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NEUTROPENIA IS VERY COMMON AMONG LYMPHOMA PATIENTS, THEY ARE MUCH PRONE TO INFECTIONS FROM THE ENVIRONMENT. FURTHERMORE, TRAINED YOGA INSTRUCTORS ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN EVERY SETTING, SO THERE IS A NEED TO DEVELOP HOME-BASED YOGA PROGRAM MODULES FOR LYMPHOMA PATIENTS RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY. AIM: THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE THE FEASIBILITY AND SAFETY OF YOGIC EXERCISES AMONG LYMPHOMA PATIENTS DURING CHEMOTHERAPY. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: AN INTERVENTIONAL, SINGLE-ARM PREPOST DESIGN STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT A TERTIARY HEALTH-CARE CENTER. PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM MALIGNANT LYMPHOMA (18-65 YEARS) WITH EASTERN COOPERATIVE ONCOLOGY GROUP PERFORMANCE STATUS FROM 0 TO 2, PLANNED TO RECEIVE CHEMOTHERAPY WERE ADMINISTERED A HOME-BASED YOGA PROGRAM OVER A PERIOD OF 2 MONTHS FROM THE START OF CHEMOTHERAPY. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME VARIABLES WERE RETENTION RATE, ACCEPTANCE RATE, SAFETY, AND ADHERENCE. HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL), FATIGUE LEVEL, OVERALL SLEEP QUALITY, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY LEVEL, AND PAIN WERE ALSO ASSESSED. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS WAS USED TO SEE THE FEASIBILITY AND ADHERENCE. THE PAIRED T-TEST WAS USED TO COMPARE VARIOUS PRE AND POSTINTERVENTION OUTCOME MEASURES. RESULTS: FOURTEEN PATIENTS (MEDIAN AGE: 36 YEARS, RANGE13-65 YEARS) OF MALIGNANT LYMPHOMA WERE ENROLLED IN THE STUDY. MALE-TO-FEMALE RATIO WAS 9:5. NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA PATIENTS CONSTITUTED 64%. THE RECRUITMENT RATE WAS 93%. FAVORABLE RETENTION (100%), ACCEPTABILITY (97%), ADHERENCE (78.6%), AND NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS FOLLOWING YOGA PRACTICE WERE REPORTED. IMPROVEMENT WAS ALSO FOUND IN HRQOL, FATIGUE, SLEEP, DEPRESSION, AND ANXIETY. HOWEVER, IT NEEDS FURTHER VALIDATION IN A RANDOMIZED STUDY. CONCLUSION: HOME-BASED YOGA PROGRAM IS SAFE AND FEASIBLE AMONG THE PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM MALIGNANT LYMPHOMA RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
14 2360  28 VIDEOCONFERENCED YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR CANCER PATIENTS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: A REPORT FROM A CLINICIAN'S PERSPECTIVE. BACKGROUND: THE ACCEPTABILITY OF VIDEOCONFERENCING DELIVERY OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN THE ADVANCED CANCER SETTING IS RELATIVELY UNEXPLORED. THE CURRENT REPORT SUMMARIZES THE CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS OF THE TRANSITION FROM AN IN-PERSON (IE, FACE-TO-FACE) TO A VIDEOCONFERENCE INTERVENTION DELIVERY APPROACH IN RESPONSE TO THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE PANDEMIC. METHOD: PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED PATIENT-FAMILY CAREGIVER DYADS WHO WERE ENROLLED IN ONGOING YOGA TRIALS AND 2 CERTIFIED YOGA THERAPISTS WHO DELIVERED THE YOGA SESSIONS. WE SUMMARIZED THEIR EXPERIENCES USING RECORDINGS OF THE YOGA SESSIONS AND INTERVENTIONISTS' PROGRESS NOTES. RESULTS: OUT OF 7 DYADS PARTICIPATING IN THE PARENT TRIAL, 1 DECLINED THE VIDEOCONFERENCED SESSIONS. PARTICIPANTS WERE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 55 AND 76 AND MOSTLY NON-HISPANIC WHITE (83%). PATIENTS WERE MAINLY MALE (83%), ALL HAD STAGE III OR IV CANCER AND WERE UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY. CAREGIVERS WERE ALL FEMALE. DESPITE CHALLENGES IN THE AREAS OF TECHNOLOGY, LOCATION, AND SETTING, INSTRUCTION AND PERSONAL CONNECTION, THE OVERALL ACCEPTABILITY WAS HIGH AMONG PATIENTS, CAREGIVERS, AND INSTRUCTORS. THROUGH THIS TRANSITION PROCESS, SOLUTIONS TO THESE CHALLENGES WERE FOUND, WHICH ARE DESCRIBED HERE. CONCLUSION: ALTHOUGH IN-PERSON INTERVENTIONS ARE FAVORED BY BOTH THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS AND THE INTERVENTIONISTS, VIDEOCONFERENCE SESSIONS WERE DEEMED ACCEPTABLE. ALL PARTICIPANTS HAD THE BENEFIT OF A PREVIOUS IN-PERSON EXPERIENCE, WHICH WAS HELPFUL AND PERHAPS NECESSARY FOR OLDER AND ADVANCED CANCER PATIENTS REQUIRING PRACTICE MODIFICATIONS. IN A REMOTE SETTING, THE ASSISTANCE OF CAREGIVERS SEEMS PARTICULARLY BENEFICIAL TO ENSURE PRACTICE SAFETY.

15 2558  44 YOGA FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN IN A PREDOMINANTLY MINORITY POPULATION: A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: SEVERAL STUDIES SUGGEST YOGA MAY BE EFFECTIVE FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN; HOWEVER, TRIALS TARGETING MINORITIES HAVE NOT BEEN CONDUCTED. PRIMARY STUDY OBJECTIVES: ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF STUDYING YOGA IN A PREDOMINANTLY MINORITY POPULATION WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. COLLECT PRELIMINARY DATA TO PLAN A LARGER POWERED STUDY. STUDY DESIGN: PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: TWO COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS IN A RACIALLY DIVERSE NEIGHBORHOOD OF BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS. PARTICIPANTS: THIRTY ENGLISH-SPEAKING ADULTS (MEAN AGE 44 YEARS, 83% FEMALE, 83% RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES; 48% WITH INCOMES < OR = $30,000) WITH MODERATE-TO-SEVERE CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. INTERVENTIONS: STANDARDIZED SERIES OF WEEKLY HATHA YOGA CLASSES FOR 12 WEEKS COMPARED TO A WAITLIST USUAL CARE CONTROL. OUTCOME MEASURES: FEASIBILITY MEASURED BY TIME TO COMPLETE ENROLLMENT, PROPORTION OF RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES ENROLLED, RETENTION RATES, AND ADVERSE EVENTS. PRIMARY EFFICACY OUTCOMES WERE CHANGES FROM BASELINE TO 12 WEEKS IN PAIN SCORE (0=NO PAIN TO 10=WORST POSSIBLE PAIN) AND BACK-RELATED FUNCTION USING THE MODIFIED ROLAND-MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE (0-23 POINT SCALE, HIGHER SCORES REFLECT POORER FUNCTION). SECONDARY EFFICACY OUTCOMES WERE ANALGESIC USE, GLOBAL IMPROVEMENT, AND QUALITY OF LIFE (SF-36). RESULTS: RECRUITMENT TOOK 2 MONTHS. RETENTION RATES WERE 97% AT 12 WEEKS AND 77% AT 26 WEEKS. MEAN PAIN SCORES FOR YOGA DECREASED FROM BASELINE TO 12 WEEKS (6.7 TO 4.4) COMPARED TO USUAL CARE, WHICH DECREASED FROM 7.5 TO 7.1 (P=.02). MEAN ROLAND SCORES FOR YOGA DECREASED FROM 14.5 TO 8.2 COMPARED TO USUAL CARE, WHICH DECREASED FROM 16.1 TO 12.5 (P=.28). AT 12 WEEKS, YOGA COMPARED TO USUAL CARE PARTICIPANTS REPORTED LESS ANALGESIC USE (13% VS 73%, P=.003), LESS OPIATE USE (0% VS 33%, P=.04), AND GREATER OVERALL IMPROVEMENT (73% VS 27%, P=.03). THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES IN SF-36 SCORES AND NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS. CONCLUSION: A YOGA STUDY INTERVENTION IN A PREDOMINANTLY MINORITY POPULATION WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN WAS MODERATELY FEASIBLE AND MAY BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN USUAL CARE FOR REDUCING PAIN AND PAIN MEDICATION USE.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
16 2557  47 YOGA FOR CHRONIC CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY PAIN: A PILOT, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. PURPOSE: TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR CANCER SURVIVORS WITH CHRONIC CIPN PAIN, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF THE INTERVENTION ON PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES. METHODS: CANCER SURVIVORS WITH CHRONIC CIPN PAIN WERE RECRUITED FROM THE BREAST, GASTROINTESTINAL, AND GYNECOLOGICAL ONCOLOGY CENTERS AT DANA-FARBER CANCER INSTITUTE. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED (2:1) TO RECEIVE AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION OR USUAL CARE. AFTER 21/50 OF PARTICIPANTS WERE ENROLLED, THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC REQUIRED THE YOGA INTERVENTION TO BE DELIVERED VIRTUALLY (I.E., ZOOM). PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION, PARTICIPANTS SELF-REPORTED CIPN AND CO-OCCURRING SYMPTOM SEVERITY. ADHERENCE TO THE INTERVENTION WAS DEFINED AS PRACTICING >/= 12 YOGA SESSIONS OVER THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION PERIOD. CHANGES IN PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES BETWEEN GROUPS WERE COMPARED USING WILCOXON'S RANK-SUM TESTS. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS (N = 28 YOGA, N = 16 CONTROL) WERE MAINLY FEMALE (96%) AND DIAGNOSED WITH STAGE III/IV DISEASE (66%). OVERALL, 19/28 (67.8%) OF YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS WERE ADHERENT TO THE YOGA PROTOCOL. YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT WITHIN-GROUP IMPROVEMENTS IN ALL PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES, INCLUDING WORST CIPN PAIN (MEDIAN CHANGE = - 1.7, P < 0.0001) AND SENSORY CIPN (MEDIAN CHANGE = - 14.8, P < 0.0001), BUT ONLY IMPROVEMENTS IN FATIGUE (P = 0.05) AND DEPRESSION (P = 0.04) WERE SIGNIFICANT COMPARED TO THE CONTROL. THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES (P > 0.05) IN CHANGES IN PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES BETWEEN IN-PERSON (N = 6) OR VIRTUAL (N = 15) YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA IS A FEASIBLE NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL MODALITY FOR CANCER SURVIVORS WITH CIPN, BUT MORE INFORMATION IS NEEDED REGARDING ITS IMPACT ON CIPN AND OTHER SYMPTOMS. TRIAL REGISTRATION: CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT03824860 IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: ONCOLOGY CLINICIANS MAY CONSIDER REFERRING CANCER SURVIVORS TO YOGA FOR CHRONIC CIPN PAIN, BUT YOGA CANNOT BE CURRENTLY RECOMMENDED AS AN EFFICACIOUS TREATMENT.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
17 1240  37 FEASIBILITY OF A MINDFUL YOGA PROGRAM FOR WOMEN WITH METASTATIC BREAST CANCER: RESULTS OF A RANDOMIZED PILOT STUDY. PURPOSE: PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC BREAST CANCER (MBC) EXPERIENCE HIGH LEVELS OF SYMPTOMS. YOGA INTERVENTIONS HAVE SHOWN PROMISE FOR IMPROVING CANCER SYMPTOMS BUT HAVE RARELY BEEN TESTED IN PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED DISEASE. THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE ACCEPTABILITY OF A COMPREHENSIVE YOGA PROGRAM FOR MBC AND THE FEASIBILITY OF CONDUCTING A RANDOMIZED TRIAL TESTING THE INTERVENTION. METHODS: SIXTY-THREE WOMEN WITH MBC WERE RANDOMIZED WITH A 2:1 ALLOCATION TO YOGA OR A SUPPORT GROUP COMPARISON CONDITION. BOTH INTERVENTIONS INVOLVED EIGHT WEEKLY GROUP SESSIONS. FEASIBILITY WAS QUANTIFIED USING RATES OF ACCRUAL, ATTRITION, AND SESSION ATTENDANCE. ACCEPTABILITY WAS ASSESSED WITH A STANDARDIZED SELF-REPORT MEASURE. PAIN, FATIGUE, SLEEP QUALITY, PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, MINDFULNESS, AND FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE, POST-INTERVENTION, AND 3 AND 6 MONTHS POST-INTERVENTION. RESULTS: WE MET GOALS FOR ACCRUAL AND RETENTION, WITH 50% OF ELIGIBLE PATIENTS ENROLLED AND 87% OF RANDOMIZED PARTICIPANTS COMPLETING POST-INTERVENTION SURVEYS. SIXTY-FIVE PERCENT OF WOMEN IN THE YOGA CONDITION AND 90% IN THE SUPPORT GROUP ATTENDED >/= 4 SESSIONS. EIGHTY PERCENT OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA CONDITION AND 65% IN THE SUPPORT GROUP INDICATED THAT THEY WERE HIGHLY SATISFIED WITH THE INTERVENTION. FOLLOWING TREATMENT, WOMEN IN THE YOGA INTERVENTION HAD MODEST IMPROVEMENTS IN SOME OUTCOMES; HOWEVER, OVERALL SYMPTOM LEVELS WERE LOW FOR WOMEN IN BOTH CONDITIONS. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE YOGA INTERVENTION CONTENT WAS HIGHLY ACCEPTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH MBC, BUT THAT THERE ARE CHALLENGES TO IMPLEMENTING AN INTERVENTION INVOLVING EIGHT GROUP-BASED IN-PERSON SESSIONS. ALTERNATIVE MODES OF DELIVERY MAY BE NECESSARY TO REACH PATIENTS MOST IN NEED OF INTERVENTION.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
18 1118  47 EFFICACY OF AN EIGHT-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION ON SYMPTOMS OF RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS): A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS) IS A COMMON AND HIGHLY BURDENSOME SLEEP DISORDER. WHILE RELAXATION THERAPIES, INCLUDING YOGA, ARE OFTEN RECOMMENDED FOR RLS MANAGEMENT, RIGOROUS SUPPORTING RESEARCH IS SPARSE. THE GOAL OF THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON RLS SYMPTOMS AND RELATED OUTCOMES IN WOMEN WITH RLS. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE 13 NONSMOKING WOMEN WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE RLS, WHO DID NOT HAVE DIABETES, SLEEP APNEA, OR OTHER SERIOUS CONCOMITANT CHRONIC CONDITIONS, AND WHO WERE NOT PREGNANT. THE INTERVENTION WAS A GENTLE, 8-WEEK IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM. CORE OUTCOMES ASSESSED PRE- AND POST-TREATMENT WERE RLS SYMPTOMS AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY (INTERNATIONAL RLS SCALE [IRLS] AND RLS ORDINAL SCALE), SLEEP QUALITY (MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY SLEEP SCALE), MOOD (PROFILE OF MOOD STATES), AND PERCEIVED STRESS (PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE). PARTICIPANTS ALSO COMPLETED YOGA LOGS AND A BRIEF EXIT QUESTIONNAIRE REGARDING THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH THE STUDY. RESULTS: TEN (10) WOMEN, AGED 32-66 YEARS, COMPLETED THE STUDY. PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED AN AVERAGE 13.4+/-0.5 (OF 16 POSSIBLE) CLASSES, AND COMPLETED A MEAN OF 4.1+/-0.3 (OF 5 POSSIBLE) HOMEWORK SESSIONS/WEEK. AT FOLLOW-UP, PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED STRIKING REDUCTIONS IN RLS SYMPTOMS AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY, WITH SYMPTOMS DECREASING TO MINIMAL/MILD IN ALL BUT 1 WOMAN AND NO PARTICIPANT SCORING IN THE SEVERE RANGE BY WEEK 8. EFFECT SIZES (COHEN'S D) WERE LARGE: 1.6 FOR IRLS TOTAL, AND 2.2 FOR RLS ORDINAL SCALE. IRLS SCORES DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH INCREASING MINUTES OF HOMEWORK PRACTICE PER SESSION (R=0.70, P=0.025) AND TOTAL HOMEWORK MINUTES (R=0.64, P<0.05), SUGGESTING A POSSIBLE DOSE-RESPONSE RELATION. PARTICIPANTS ALSO SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN SLEEP, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND MOOD (ALL P'S</=0.02), WITH EFFECT SIZES RANGING FROM 1.0 TO 1.6. CONCLUSIONS: THESE PRELIMINARY FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN ATTENUATING RLS SYMPTOMS AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY, REDUCING PERCEIVED STRESS, AND IMPROVING SLEEP AND MOOD IN WOMEN WITH RLS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
19  345  33 ASSESSING FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF YOGA AND GROUP CBT FOR ADOLESCENTS WITH DEPRESSION: A PILOT RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. PURPOSE: GIVEN INCREASING RATES OF DEPRESSION IN ADOLESCENTS, THERE IS A CLEAR NEED FOR INNOVATIVE TREATMENTS. IN THIS PILOT RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL, WE ASSESSED ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF TWO GROUP-BASED INTERVENTIONS: YOGA AND COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT). THE GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO PREPARE FOR A FUTURE FULLY POWERED RANDOMIZED TRIAL TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT YOGA IS NOT INFERIOR TO AN ESTABLISHED ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION TREATMENT, NAMELY, GROUP CBT. METHODS: WE ENROLLED 42 ADOLESCENTS WITH ELEVATED DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A 12-WEEK GROUP-BASED INTERVENTION, YOGA OR CBT. WE HAD A PRIORI FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY TARGETS, INCLUDING FOR RECRUITMENT RATE, RETENTION RATE, EXPECTANCY, CREDIBILITY, PROGRAM SATISFACTION, CLASS ATTENDANCE, ENGAGEMENT IN HOME PRACTICE, AND INSTRUCTOR/LEADER MANUAL ADHERENCE. WE ASSESSED ADVERSE EVENTS, AND WITHIN-SUBJECT CHANGES IN OUTCOMES (DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, IMPAIRMENT, SLEEP DISTURBANCE) AND POSSIBLE MEDIATORS (MINDFULNESS, SELF-COMPASSION). RESULTS: BOTH INTERVENTIONS MET MOST ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY TARGETS. THE ONLY TARGET NOT MET RELATED TO LOW ENGAGEMENT IN HOME PRACTICE. PARTICIPANTS WITHIN EACH STUDY ARM SHOWED DECREASED DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS OVER TIME AND INCREASED SELF-COMPASSION. CONCLUSIONS: A YOGA INTERVENTION APPEARS TO BE ACCEPTABLE AND FEASIBLE TO ADOLESCENTS WITH DEPRESSION. HOWEVER, IT MAY BE CHALLENGING FOR THIS GROUP TO ENGAGE IN UNSTRUCTURED HOME PRACTICE.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
20  518  34 COMPARING ONCE- VERSUS TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN IN PREDOMINANTLY LOW INCOME MINORITIES: A RANDOMIZED DOSING TRIAL. BACKGROUND. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT ONCE-WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES ARE EFFECTIVE FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) IN WHITE ADULTS WITH HIGH SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. THE COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF TWICE-WEEKLY CLASSES AND GENERALIZABILITY TO RACIALLY DIVERSE LOW INCOME POPULATIONS ARE UNKNOWN. METHODS. WE CONDUCTED A 12-WEEK RANDOMIZED, PARALLEL-GROUP, DOSING TRIAL FOR 95 ADULTS RECRUITED FROM AN URBAN SAFETY-NET HOSPITAL AND FIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS COMPARING ONCE-WEEKLY (N = 49) VERSUS TWICE-WEEKLY (N = 46) STANDARDIZED YOGA CLASSES SUPPLEMENTED BY HOME PRACTICE. PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE CHANGE FROM BASELINE TO 12 WEEKS IN PAIN (11-POINT SCALE) AND BACK-RELATED FUNCTION (23-POINT MODIFIED ROLAND-MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE). RESULTS. 82% OF PARTICIPANTS WERE NONWHITE; 77% HAD ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD INCOMES <$40,000. THE SAMPLE'S BASELINE MEAN PAIN INTENSITY [6.9 (SD 1.6)] AND FUNCTION [13.7 (SD 5.0)] REFLECTED MODERATE TO SEVERE BACK PAIN AND IMPAIRMENT. PAIN AND BACK-RELATED FUNCTION IMPROVED WITHIN BOTH GROUPS (P < 0.001). HOWEVER, THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ONCE-WEEKLY AND TWICE-WEEKLY GROUPS FOR PAIN REDUCTION [-2.1 (95% CI -2.9, -1.3) VERSUS -2.4 (95% CI -3.1, -1.8), P = 0.62] OR BACK-RELATED FUNCTION [-5.1 (95% CI -7.0, -3.2) VERSUS -4.9 (95% CI -6.5, -3.3), P = 0.83]. CONCLUSIONS. TWELVE WEEKS OF ONCE-WEEKLY OR TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES WERE SIMILARLY EFFECTIVE FOR PREDOMINANTLY LOW INCOME MINORITY ADULTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN.

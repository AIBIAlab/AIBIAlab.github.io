1  104 131 A PILOT FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY STUDY OF YOGA/MEDITATION ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND MARKERS OF STRESS IN PERSONS LIVING WITH HIV WHO ALSO USE CRACK COCAINE. BACKGROUND: PERSONS LIVING WITH HIV (PLWH) WHO ALSO USE CRACK COCAINE MAY HAVE STRESSFUL, CHAOTIC LIVES AND TYPICALLY DO NOT ENGAGE IN STANDARD MEDICAL CARE THAT ADDRESSES A MULTITUDE OF EXTENUATING LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES. YOGA/MEDITATION (YM) IMPROVES QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AND BIOMARKERS OF STRESS, BUT THE EFFECT OF THIS INTERVENTION IS ALMOST UNKNOWN IN PLWH, PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO USE CRACK COCAINE. OBJECTIVES: THIS PILOT STUDY SOUGHT TO COMPARE THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF 60-MINUTE, TWICE-PER-WEEK SESSIONS OF YM FOR 2 MONTHS WITH THOSE OF NO-CONTACT CONTROL AND TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF THE INTERVENTION ON QOL (ACCORDING TO THE SHORT FORM-36, PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE [PSS], AND IMPACT OF EVENTS SCALE [IES]) AND SALIVARY CORTISOL AND DEHYDROEPIANDROSTERONE SULFATE (DHEA-S) AMONG PLWH WHO USE CRACK COCAINE. DESIGN: PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO YM OR NO-CONTACT CONTROL AND WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE, 2 MONTHS AFTER THE INTERVENTION, AND 4 MONTHS' FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: THE YM PROGRAM WAS ACCEPTABLE AND FEASIBLE, WITH HIGH OVERALL ATTENDANCE (89%) AND INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPATION IN YOGA SESSIONS (83%). YM PARTICIPANTS SHOWED MODEST IMPROVEMENTS ON QOL. THE PSS TOTAL SCORE AND THE IES INTRUSION SCORE IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY 2 MONTHS AFTER THE INTERVENTION, BUT CORTISOL AND DHEA-S DID NOT CHANGE. CONCLUSIONS: THIS PILOT STUDY SHOWED A HIGH LEVEL OF FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY AND MODEST EFFECTS ON MEASURES OF QOL AMONG PLWH WHO USE CRACK COCAINE. THE RESULTS SUGGEST UTILITY OF YM AS A SIMPLE, SAFE, AND INEXPENSIVE FORMAT TO IMPROVE QOL IN A POPULATION THAT HAS MANY MEDICAL DIFFICULTIES AND EXTENUATING STRESSORS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
2 2718  48 YOGA MEDITATION (YOMED) AND ITS EFFECT ON PROPRIOCEPTION AND BALANCE FUNCTION IN ELDERS WHO HAVE FALLEN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROL STUDY. OBJECTIVE: YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE MUSCLE STRENGTH, FLEXIBILITY, AND BALANCE. HOWEVER, THE IMPACT OF MEDITATION ON DYNAMIC FACTORS SUCH AS GAIT, REACTIVE BALANCE AND PROPRIOCEPTION HAS YET TO BE EXAMINED. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO TEST IF A NOVEL YOGA MEDITATION PROGRAM (YOMED) IS AS EFFECTIVE AS A STANDARD PROPRIOCEPTIVE TRAINING IN IMPROVING PROPRIOCEPTION, BALANCE AND POWER IN OLDER INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE FALLEN. DESIGN: SIXTEEN OLDER PERSONS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER THE YOMED GROUP (YM) OR PROPRIOCEPTION TRAINING GROUP (PT). EACH GROUP RECEIVED 45MIN OF TRAINING, 3DAYS PER WEEK, FOR 6 WEEKS. PRETEST AND POST-TEST OUTCOME MEASURES WERE USED TO QUANTIFY THE COMPARATIVE EFFECTS OF THE INTERVENTIONS. SETTING: RESEARCH LABORATORY. INTERVENTIONS: YOGA MEDITATION AND PROPRIOCEPTIVE TRAINING. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: THE BALANCE ERROR SCORING SYSTEM (BESS), THE TENETTI BALANCE AND GAIT ASSESSMENT, DYNAMIC POSTUROGRAPHY, JOINT POSITION SENSE, JOINT KINESTHESIA AND LEG EXTENSOR POWER. RESULTS: THE PRIMARY FINDINGS OF THE STUDY WERE THAT NEITHER THE YM OR PT INTERVENTION GROUPS SHOWED STATISTICAL IMPROVEMENTS IN ANY VARIABLE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE DYNAMIC POSTUROGRAPHY OVERALL SCORE (DMA), WHICH SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT BY THE YM GROUP (D=1.238; P=0.049). ADDITIONALLY CHANGES IN A NUMBER OF VARIABLES THAT DID NOT REACH SIGNIFICANCE DEMONSTRATED EFFECT SIZES IN THE MEDIUM TO HIGH RANGE. CONCLUSION: THESE RESULTS INDICATE THE POTENTIAL FOR THE YOMED PROGRAM TO BE USED AS A CLINICAL INTERVENTION IN OLDER INDIVIDUALS. GIVEN THESE RESULTS A LONGER STUDY USING A LARGER SAMPLE SIZE AND INDIVIDUALS AT HIGHER RISK OF FALLING IS WARRANTED.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
3 2355  30 VALIDATION OF YOGA MODULE FOR CHILDREN WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES. BACKGROUND: CHILDREN WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES GENERALLY EXPERIENCE MORE PAIN THAN THE NORMAL CHILDREN DUE TO CHRONIC SYSTEMIC CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR DISABILITY. DESCRIPTION OF PAIN IS GENERALLY DIFFICULT IN CHILDREN AND MORE SO IN CHILDREN WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES (IDS). YOGA HAS BEEN REGARDED AS A KIND OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AS WELL AS A PAIN MANAGEMENT STRATEGY. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE REPORTED THE BENEFICIAL ROLE OF YOGA IN ENHANCING PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOMOTOR ABILITIES OF IDS; HOWEVER, A VALIDATED YOGA MODULE (YM) FOR IDS IS UNAVAILABLE. THE PRESENT STUDY IS AIMED AT DEVELOPING A VALIDATED YM FOR CHILDREN WITH IDS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE CONTENT VALIDITY OF YM FOR CHILDREN WITH IDS WAS ASSESSED BY A PANEL OF 22 EXPERIENCED YOGA EXPERTS. THE YM FOR CHILDREN WITH IDS WAS DEVELOPED IN THE FORM OF TAILOR-MADE YOGA PRACTICES THAT WERE SUPPORTED BY CLASSICAL TEXTS AND RESEARCH EVIDENCE. A TOTAL OF 32 PRACTICES WERE INCLUDED IN THE YM, AND EACH PRACTICE WAS DISCUSSED AND RATED AS (I) NOT ESSENTIAL, (II) USEFUL BUT NOT ESSENTIAL, AND (III) ESSENTIAL. THE CONTENT VALIDITITY RATIOWAS CALCULATED USING LAWSHE'S FORMULA. RESULTS: DATA ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT OUT OF 32 YM PRACTICES, 31 INDICATED SIGNIFICANT CONTENT VALIDITY (CUTOFF VALUE: 0.42, AS CALCULATED BY APPLYING LAWSHE'S FORMULA FOR THE CVR). CONCLUSIONS: THE PRESENT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THE YM FOR CHILDREN WITH IDS IS VALID WITH GOOD CONTENT VALIDITY. HOWEVER, FUTURE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS MUST DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFICACY OF THE DEVELOPED YM FOR CHILDREN WITH IDS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
4 2719  31 YOGA MEDITATION ENHANCES PROPRIOCEPTION AND BALANCE IN INDIVIDUALS DIAGNOSED WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE. THIS STUDY COMPARED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TWO PROPRIOCEPTIVE EXERCISE PROGRAMS FOR PERSONS DIAGNOSED WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD). THIRTY-THREE PATIENTS WITH MILD TO MODERATE PD WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A YOGA MEDITATION PROGRAM (YOMED) OR TO AN ESTABLISHED PROPRIOCEPTIVE TRAINING PROGRAM (PRO). BOTH INTERVENTIONS INCLUDED TWICE WEEKLY SESSIONS (45 MINUTES EACH), SPANNING A 12-WEEK PERIOD. OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED: JOINT POSITION SENSE (JPS45 DEGREES , JPS55 DEGREES , JPS65 DEGREES ) AND JOINT KINESTHESIA (JKFLEX AND JKEXT), THE TINETTI BALANCE ASSESSMENT TOOL (TIN), FALLS EFFICACY SCALE (FES), BALANCE ERROR SCORING SYSTEM (BESS), DYNAMIC POSTUROGRAPHY (DMA AND TIME) AND THE TIMED UP-AND-GO TEST (TUG). TEST ADMINISTRATORS WERE BLINDED TO GROUP AFFILIATION. SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCES FAVORING THE YOMED GROUP WERE OBSERVED FOR TIN (P = 0.01, D = 0.77) AND JKFLEX (P = 0.05, D = -0.72). DMA AND TIME SCORES SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED FOR BOTH GROUPS, AND NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE YOMED PROGRAM IS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE FOR PATIENTS WITH PD. RESEARCHERS SHOULD CONTINUE TO EXAMINE THE CLINICAL EFFICACY OF MIND-BODY TECHNIQUES TO IMPROVE MOVEMENT CONTROL AND BODY AWARENESS IN THIS POPULATION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
5  602  29 DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF A YOGA MODULE FOR PARKINSON DISEASE. BACKGROUND PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD), A PROGRESSIVE NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE, AFFECTS MOTOR AND NONMOTOR FUNCTIONS, LEADING TO SEVERE DEBILITY AND POOR QUALITY OF LIFE. STUDIES HAVE REPORTED THE BENEFICIAL ROLE OF YOGA IN ALLEVIATING THE SYMPTOMS OF PD; HOWEVER, A VALIDATED YOGA MODULE FOR PD IS UNAVAILABLE. THIS STUDY DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED AN INTEGRATED YOGA MODULE(IYM) FOR PD. METHODS THE IYM WAS PREPARED AFTER A THOROUGH REVIEW OF CLASSICAL YOGA TEXTS AND PREVIOUS FINDINGS. TWENTY EXPERIENCED YOGA EXPERTS, WHO FULFILLED THE INCLUSION CRITERIA, WERE SELECTED VALIDATING THE CONTENT OF THE IYM. A TOTAL OF 28 PRACTICES WERE INCLUDED IN THE IYM, AND EACH PRACTICE WAS DISCUSSED AND RATED AS (I) NOT ESSENTIAL, (II) USEFUL BUT NOT ESSENTIAL, AND (III) ESSENTIAL; THE CONTENT VALIDITY RATIO (CVR) WAS CALCULATED USING LAWSHE'S FORMULA. RESULTS DATA ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT OF THE 28 IYM PRACTICES, 21 EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT CONTENT VALIDITY (CUT-OFF VALUE: 0.42, AS CALCULATED BY APPLYING LAWSHE'S FORMULA FOR THE CVR). CONCLUSIONS THE IYM IS VALID FOR PD, WITH GOOD CONTENT VALIDITY. HOWEVER, FUTURE STUDIES MUST DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFICACY OF THE DEVELOPED MODULE.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
6  456  34 CHANGES IN NONMOTOR SYMPTOMS FOLLOWING AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION FOR PEOPLE WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE. PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD) IS A NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDER MARKED BY PROGRESSIVE DEGENERATIVE MOTOR SYMPTOMS (E.G., TREMORS, IMPAIRED BALANCE AND GAIT) AND NONMOTOR SYMPTOMS (E.G., FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCES, PAIN) THAT CAN NEGATIVELY INFLUENCE HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL). PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT YOGA FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH PD IMPROVES BALANCE, STRENGTH, AND MOBILITY. HOWEVER, LITTLE RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON NONMOTOR SYMPTOMS OF PD. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN NONMOTOR SYMPTOMS AMONG INDIVIDUALS WITH PD FOLLOWING AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. DATA USED FOR ANALYSES WERE PART OF A LARGER STUDY THAT RESEARCHED IMPROVEMENTS IN MOTOR FUNCTION FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH PD. PARTICIPANTS (N = 27) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EXPERIMENTAL (N = 15) AND CONTROL (N = 12) GROUPS AND COMPLETED PRE- AND POSTINTERVENTION QUANTITATIVE MEASURES. WITHIN-GROUP IMPROVEMENTS WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT FOR FATIGUE MEASURED BY THE PARKINSON'S FATIGUE SCALE, BALANCE CONFIDENCE MEASURED BY THE ACTIVITIES BALANCE CONFIDENCE SCALE, THE BELIEF IN ONE'S ABILITY TO MANAGE FALLS MEASURED BY THE FALLS MANAGEMENT SCALE, ACTIVITY CONSTRAINTS MEASURED BY THE ACTIVITIES CONSTRAINT QUESTIONNAIRE, AND PD-SPECIFIC QUALITY OF LIFE MEASURED BY THE PARKINSON'S DISEASE QUESTIONNAIRE-8. ACROSS-GROUP CHANGES WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT FOR ACTIVITY CONSTRAINTS. FINDINGS INDICATE YOGA MAY BE AN EFFICACIOUS INTERVENTION FOR IMPROVING NONMOTOR SYMPTOMS AS WELL AS HRQOL FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH PD.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
7 1276  29 FUNCTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS IN PARKINSON'S DISEASE FOLLOWING A RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF YOGA. INDIVIDUALS WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD) EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS IN MOTOR FUNCTION, FUNCTIONAL GAIT, POSTURAL STABILITY, AND BALANCE. THESE LIMITATIONS OFTEN LEAD TO HIGHER INCIDENCES OF FALLS, WHICH HAVE SIGNIFICANT COMPLICATIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH PD. YOGA MAY IMPROVE THESE FUNCTIONAL DEFICITS IN INDIVIDUALS WITH PD. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE CHANGES IN MOTOR FUNCTION, FUNCTIONAL GAIT, POSTURAL STABILITY, AND BALANCE CONTROL FOR COMMUNITY DWELLING INDIVIDUALS WITH PD. THIS RANDOMIZED, WAIT-LIST CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY EXAMINED THE INFLUENCE OF AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION FOR PEOPLE WITH PD WHO MET THE FOLLOWING INCLUSION CRITERIA: ENDORSING A FEAR OF FALLING, BEING ABLE TO SPEAK ENGLISH, SCORING 4/6 ON THE MINIMENTAL STATE EXAM, AND BEING WILLING TO ATTEND THE INTERVENTION TWICE WEEKLY FOR 8-WEEKS. PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP (N=15) EXPERIENCED IMPROVEMENTS IN MOTOR FUNCTION, POSTURAL STABILITY, FUNCTIONAL GAIT, AND FREEZING GAIT, AS WELL AS REDUCTIONS IN FALL RISK. PARTICIPANTS IN THE WAIT-LIST CONTROL (N=12) ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED IN POSTURAL STABILITY, ALTHOUGH THEIR FALL RISK WAS NOT REDUCED. INDIVIDUALS IN THE YOGA GROUP SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THEIR FALL RISK. AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION MAY REDUCE FALL RISK AND IMPROVE POSTURAL STABILITY, AND FUNCTIONAL AND FREEZING GAIT IN INDIVIDUALS WITH PD.

8 1165  50 EVALUATING THE FEASIBILITY AND IMPACT OF A YOGA INTERVENTION ON COGNITION, PHYSICAL FUNCTION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND AFFECTIVE OUTCOMES IN PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV: PROTOCOL FOR A RANDOMIZED PILOT TRIAL. BACKGROUND: DESPITE LOWER MORTALITY RATES DUE TO COMBINATION ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY, PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV (PLWH) ARE GRAPPLING WITH INCREASINGLY COMPLEX HEALTH ISSUES, INCLUDING COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS IN AREAS SUCH AS MEMORY, ATTENTION, PROCESSING SPEED, AND MOTOR FUNCTION. YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE AN EFFECTIVE FORM OF EXERCISE AND MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION FOR MANY CLINICAL POPULATIONS. HOWEVER, NO RANDOMIZED TRIALS HAVE EVALUATED THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION AMONG PLWH. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS PILOT RANDOMIZED TRIAL WAS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA INTERVENTION TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR A FULL-SCALE, MULTISITE, COMMUNITY-BASED TRIAL FOR PLWH. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES ARE TO (1) ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF STUDY PROTOCOL AND PROCEDURES, (2) COMPARE COGNITION IN THE YOGA GROUP WITH THE USUAL CARE CONTROL GROUP AFTER 12 WEEKS OF THE INTERVENTION IN PLWH, AND (3) COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF THE 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION VERSUS CONTROL ON BALANCE, WALKING SPEED, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, MENTAL HEALTH, MEDICATION ADHERENCE, AND QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG PLWH. METHODS: WE PROPOSE A PILOT RANDOMIZED TRIAL WITH 2 PARALLEL GROUPS (YOGA VERSUS CONTROL). WE WILL RECRUIT 25 PLWH (>35 YEARS) FROM COMMUNITY AND HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS IN HALIFAX, CANADA. AFTER BASELINE ASSESSMENT WITH BLINDED ASSESSORS, PARTICIPANTS WILL BE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO THE YOGA OR CONTROL GROUP, USING A RANDOM COMPUTER GENERATOR. PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP WILL ENGAGE IN SUPERVISED 60-MIN GROUP-BASED YOGA SESSIONS 3 TIMES A WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS AT A YOGA STUDIO. PARTICIPANTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP WILL MAINTAIN THEIR CURRENT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY LEVELS THROUGHOUT THE STUDY. RESULTS: AS PER THE CONSOLIDATED STANDARDS OF REPORTING TRIALS EXTENSION FOR PILOT STUDIES, MEANS OF ALL OUTCOMES, MEAN CHANGE, AND 95% CIS WILL BE CALCULATED FOR EACH GROUP SEPARATELY. TWO-TAILED INDEPENDENT T TESTS AND FISHER EXACT TESTS WILL BE USED TO COMPARE GROUPS AT BASELINE. WE WILL ANALYZE QUANTITATIVE POSTINTERVENTION QUESTIONNAIRE RESPONSES USING CHI-SQUARE TESTS, AND OPEN-ENDED RESPONSES WILL BE ANALYZED THEMATICALLY. INTENTION-TO-TREAT AND PER-PROTOCOL ANALYSES WILL BE USED TO ANALYZE SECONDARY VARIABLES. CHANGES IN OUTCOME VARIABLES WILL BE EXAMINED BETWEEN GROUPS AND WITHIN GROUPS. EFFECT SIZES WILL BE REPORTED FOR EACH OUTCOME. A PRIORI ADHERENCE AND SATISFACTION CRITERIA WILL BE MET IF PARTICIPANTS ATTEND >70% OF THE YOGA SESSIONS AND IF >70% OF THE PARTICIPANTS ARE SATISFIED WITH THE INTERVENTION AS DETERMINED BY A POSTPARTICIPATION QUESTIONNAIRE. STUDY ENROLLMENT BEGAN IN JANUARY 2018, WITH RESULTS EXPECTED FOR OCTOBER 2019. CONCLUSIONS: THIS PILOT RANDOMIZED TRIAL WILL BE THE FIRST TO INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFECT OF A YOGA INTERVENTION ON COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL OUTCOMES AMONG PLWH. THIS WORK WILL INFORM THE FEASIBILITY OF FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS IN TERMS OF CAPACITY BUILDING, PARTICIPANT RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION, AND ASSESSMENT AND INTERVENTION PROTOCOLS.

9   12  41 "MERGING YOGA AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY (MY-OT): A FEASIBILITY AND PILOT STUDY". OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND BENEFITS OF THE MERGING YOGA AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY (MY-OT) INTERVENTION. DESIGN: THIS IS THE PRIMARY ANALYSIS OF A NON-CONTROLLED PRETEST-POSTTEST PILOT STUDY TO UNDERSTAND THE FEASIBILITY AND IMPACT OF MY-OT ON BALANCE, BALANCE SELF-EFFICACY, AND FALL RISK FACTOR MANAGEMENT IN PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC STROKE. SETTING: UNIVERSITY RESEARCH LABORATORY. PARTICIPANTS: PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC STROKE WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY IF THEY: HAD SUSTAINED A FALL OR HAD FEAR OF FALLING, WERE ABLE TO STAND, AND HAND IMPAIRED BALANCE AND WERE AT RISK FOR FALLS (</=46 ON THE BERG BALANCE SCALE (BBS)). INTERVENTIONS: INDIVIDUALS COMPLETED AN 8 WEEK INTERVENTION THAT INCLUDED 16 SESSIONS OF BOTH YOGA AND GROUP OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY (OT). YOGA INCLUDED PHYSICAL POSTURES, BREATHING EXERCISES, AND MEDITATION. OT FOCUSED ON POST-STROKE FALL RISK FACTOR MANAGEMENT. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: THE BBS WAS USED TO ASSESS BALANCE, THE ACTIVITIES-SPECIFIC BALANCE CONFIDENCE SCALE (ABC) WAS USED TO MEASURE BALANCE SELF-EFFICACY. FIVE FALL RISK FACTOR MANAGEMENT SCALES WERE USED. RESULTS: OVERALL, THE INTERVENTION WAS CONSIDERED FEASIBLE, AS INDIVIDUALS WERE ABLE TO SAFELY COMPLETE THE INTERVENTION WITH LITTLE ATTRITION AND HIGH ATTENDANCE. BALANCE IMPROVED BY 30% (P=0.002). BALANCE SELF-EFFICACY IMPROVED BY 15% (P=0.034). EACH OF THE FIVE FALL RISK FACTOR MANAGEMENT SCALES IMPROVED, BUT ONLY TWO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED (FALL PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT QUESTIONNAIRE, 29%, P=0.004 AND FALL PREVENTION STRATEGY SURVEY, 42%, P=0.032). CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT MY-OT IS A POTENTIAL INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE MULTIPLE FALL RELATED OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE WITH STROKE. THERAPISTS MAY CONSIDER THESE INTERVENTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH STROKE, BUT ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS WARRANTED.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
10 2099  32 THE EFFECT OF YOGA MEDITATION PRACTICE ON YOUNG ADULTS' INHIBITORY CONTROL: AN FNIRS STUDY. OBJECTIVES: THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO TEST THE EFFECT OF YOGA MEDITATION (YOMED) PRACTICE ON INHIBITORY CONTROL OF YOUNG ADULTS. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 50 PARTICIPANTS (23 MALE, 21-28 YEARS OLD) FROM A UNIVERSITY IN JINAN, SHANDONG PROVINCE WERE ENROLLED IN THIS STUDY. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A YOMED GROUP OR A CONTROL GROUP. PARTICIPANTS' BASIC INFORMATION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND INHIBITORY CONTROL WERE MEASURED. A MULTI-CHANNEL CONTINUOUS-WAVE NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROMETER WAS USED TO MONITOR THE BRAIN'S HEMODYNAMIC RESPONSES. RESULTS: AFTER THE INTERVENTION, WE FOUND SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN FLANKER TASKS BETWEEN THE YOMED GROUP AND CONTROL GROUP. THE ACCURACY IN THE YOMED GROUP WAS HIGHER THAN THOSE IN THE CONTROL GROUP (P < 0.05). ANALYSIS OF FNIRS DATA SHOWED THAT OXYHEMOGLOBIN (OXY-HB) LEVELS IN THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX (PFC) INCREASED IN THE YOMED GROUP DURING THE FLANKER TASKS AFTER THE YOMED INTERVENTION. CONCLUSION: YOMED HAS A TEMPORARILY PROMOTING EFFECT ON THE BRAIN ACTIVATION OF YOUNG ADULTS. IT IS AN EFFECTIVE AND APPROPRIATE EXERCISE TO IMPROVE THE INHIBITORY CONTROL OF YOUNG ADULTS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
11 1228  32 FEASIBILITY AND IMPACT OF A YOGA INTERVENTION ON COGNITION, PHYSICAL FUNCTION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND AFFECTIVE OUTCOMES AMONG PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT TRIAL. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IS TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY AND IMPACT OF A TRIWEEKLY 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION AMONG PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV (PLWH). ADDITIONAL OBJECTIVES INCLUDED EVALUATING COGNITION, PHYSICAL FUNCTION, MEDICATION ADHERENCE, HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL), AND MENTAL HEALTH AMONG YOGA PARTICIPANTS VERSUS CONTROLS USING BLINDED ASSESSORS. WE RECRUITED 22 MEDICALLY STABLE PLWH AGED >/=35 YEARS. A PRIORI FEASIBILITY CRITERIA WERE >/=70% YOGA SESSION ATTENDANCE AND >/=70% OF PARTICIPANTS SATISFIED WITH THE INTERVENTION USING A POSTPARTICIPATION QUESTIONNAIRE. TWO PARTICIPANTS WITHDREW FROM THE YOGA GROUP. MEAN YOGA CLASS ATTENDANCE WAS 82%, WITH 100% SATISFACTION.

12 1765  36 POSTSTROKE BALANCE IMPROVES WITH YOGA: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: BALANCE IMPAIRMENT IS COMMON AFTER STROKE; MODIFIED YOGA MAY BE ABLE TO IMPROVE BALANCE AND OTHER IMPORTANT POSTSTROKE VARIABLES. SCIENTIFIC-EVIDENCE IS NEEDED TO SUPPORT SUCH TREATMENT INTERVENTIONS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF A YOGA-BASED REHABILITATION INTERVENTION ON BALANCE, BALANCE SELF-EFFICACY, FEAR OF FALLING (FOF), AND QUALITY OF LIFE AFTER STROKE. METHODS: THIS WAS A PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, PILOT STUDY OF YOGA-BASED REHABILITATION FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC STROKE. ALL YOGA SESSIONS WERE TAUGHT BY A REGISTERED YOGA THERAPIST, OCCURRED TWICE PER WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS AND INCLUDED SEATED, STANDING, AND FLOOR POSTURES WITH RELAXATION AND MEDITATION. BALANCE WAS ASSESSED WITH THE BERG BALANCE SCALE, BALANCE SELF-EFFICACY WITH THE ACTIVITIES-SPECIFIC BALANCE CONFIDENCE SCALE, FOF WITH A DICHOTOMOUS YES/NO QUESTION, AND QUALITY OF LIFE WITH THE STROKE SPECIFIC QUALITY OF LIFE SCALE. RESULTS: THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WAIT-LIST CONTROL (N=10) AND YOGA (N=37) GROUPS IN BASELINE OR FOLLOW-UP SCORES. HOWEVER, USING WITHIN-GROUP COMPARISONS, YOGA GROUP DATA DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN BALANCE (BERG BALANCE SCALE, 41.3+/-11.7 VS 46.3+/-9.1; P<0.001) AND FOF (51% VS 46% WITH FOF; P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A GROUP YOGA-BASED REHABILITATION INTERVENTION FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC STROKE HAS POTENTIAL IN IMPROVING MULTIPLE POSTSTROKE VARIABLES. GROUP YOGA MAY BE COMPLEMENTARY TO REHABILITATION, MAY BE POSSIBLE IN MEDICAL-BASED AND COMMUNITY-BASED SETTINGS, AND MAY BE COST-EFFECTIVE. FURTHER TESTING OF GROUP YOGA-BASED REHABILITATION INTERVENTIONS IS WARRANTED. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION- URL: HTTP://CLINICALTRIALS.GOV.

13 1863  36 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA AND EXERCISE IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA AND OF AEROBIC EXERCISE ON COGNITIVE FUNCTION, FATIGUE, MOOD, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS). METHODS: SUBJECTS WITH CLINICALLY DEFINITE MS AND EXPANDED DISABILITY STATUS SCORE LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 6.0 WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THREE GROUPS LASTING 6 MONTHS: WEEKLY IYENGAR YOGA CLASS ALONG WITH HOME PRACTICE, WEEKLY EXERCISE CLASS USING A STATIONARY BICYCLE ALONG WITH HOME EXERCISE, OR A WAITING-LIST CONTROL GROUP. OUTCOME ASSESSMENTS PERFORMED AT BASELINE AND AT THE END OF THE 6-MONTH PERIOD INCLUDED A BATTERY OF COGNITIVE MEASURES FOCUSED ON ATTENTION, PHYSIOLOGIC MEASURES OF ALERTNESS, PROFILE OF MOOD STATES, STATE-TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY, MULTI-DIMENSIONAL FATIGUE INVENTORY (MFI), AND SHORT FORM (SF)-36 HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE. RESULTS: SIXTY-NINE SUBJECTS WERE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED. TWELVE SUBJECTS DID NOT FINISH THE 6-MONTH INTERVENTION. THERE WERE NO ADVERSE EVENTS RELATED TO THE INTERVENTION. THERE WERE NO EFFECTS FROM EITHER OF THE ACTIVE INTERVENTIONS ON EITHER OF THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES OF ATTENTION OR ALERTNESS. BOTH ACTIVE INTERVENTIONS PRODUCED IMPROVEMENT IN SECONDARY MEASURES OF FATIGUE COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP: ENERGY AND FATIGUE (VITALITY) ON THE SF-36 AND GENERAL FATIGUE ON THE MFI. THERE WERE NO CLEAR CHANGES IN MOOD RELATED TO YOGA OR EXERCISE. CONCLUSION: SUBJECTS WITH MS PARTICIPATING IN EITHER A 6-MONTH YOGA CLASS OR EXERCISE CLASS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN MEASURES OF FATIGUE COMPARED TO A WAITING-LIST CONTROL GROUP. THERE WAS NO RELATIVE IMPROVEMENT OF COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN EITHER OF THE INTERVENTION GROUPS.	2004	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
14 1252  39 FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY AND EVALUATION OF MEDITATION TO AUGMENT YOGA PRACTICE AMONG PERSONS DIAGNOSED WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA. OBJECTIVE: TO DESIGN A MEDITATION PROTOCOL AND TEST ITS FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY AND EFFICACY IN CONJUNCTION WITH YT FOR PERSONS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA (SZ). METHODS: THE MEDITATION PROTOCOL CONSISTED OF ANAPANA (OBSERVING NORMAL RESPIRATION) AND YOGA NIDRA (SUPINE, RESTFUL AWARENESS). IN A SINGLE BLIND RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, MEDICATED AND CLINICALLY STABLE OUTPATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH SZ WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE TREATMENT AS USUAL (TAU), TAU AUGMENTED WITH YOGA TRAINING (YT), OR TAU AUGMENTED WITH MEDITATION AND YOGA TRAINING (MYT) FOR THREE WEEKS (N=145). ACCEPTABILITY, CLINICAL, SOCIAL AND COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS WERE ASSESSED AFTER 3 WEEKS AND 3 MONTHS POST RANDOMIZATION USING WITHIN GROUP AND BETWEEN GROUPS ANALYSES WITH REPEATED MEASURES MULTIVARIATE TESTS. RESULTS: NO GROUP-WISE DIFFERENCES IN COMPLIANCE, STUDY DISCONTINUATION, MAJOR/SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS OR ADVERSE EVENTS WERE NOTED. FOR SIX ASSESSED CLINICAL VARIABLES, THE DIRECTION OF CHANGES WERE IN THE DESIRED DIRECTION AND THE EFFECT SIZES WERE GREATER IN THE MYT GROUP COMPARED WITH THE TAU GROUP AT BOTH TIME POINTS. CHANGES IN SOCIAL FUNCTION VARIABLES WERE GREATER AT 3 MONTHS THAN AT 3 WEEKS. NOMINALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN INDIVIDUAL COGNITIVE DOMAINS WERE NOTED IN ALL GROUPS AT BOTH TIME POINTS. ALL EFFECT SIZES WERE IN THE SMALL TO MEDIUM RANGE. CONCLUSION: MYT IS FEASIBLE, ACCEPTABLE AND SHOWS MODEST BENEFITS FOR PERSONS WITH SZ. MYT CAN ALSO IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE AND CLINICAL SYMPTOMS. LARGER STUDIES OF LONGER DURATION ARE WARRANTED.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
15 2134  35 THE EFFECTS OF A THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM ON POSTURAL CONTROL, MOBILITY, AND GAIT SPEED IN COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF A 12-WEEK THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM ON GAIT SPEED, POSTURAL CONTROL, AND MOBILITY IN COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS. DESIGN: QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WITH A PRETEST/POST-TEST DESIGN. RESEARCHERS EVALUATED CHANGES OVER TIME (PRETEST TO POST-TEST) IN ALL OUTCOME MEASURES. PAIRED T-TESTS WERE USED TO ANALYZE NORMAL AND FAST GAIT SPEED, TIMED UP AND GO TEST, AND TIMED UP AND GO DUAL TASK. WILCOXON SIGNED-RANK TEST WAS USED TO EVALUATE SCORES FOR THE MINI-BESTEST (MBT). SETTING: YOGA CLASSES WERE PERFORMED AT A LOCAL SENIOR CENTER. BLIND EXAMINERS WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY TRAINED IN THE OUTCOME MEASURES PERFORMED ALL PRETESTS AND POST-TESTS AT THE SITE. PARTICIPANTS: THIRTEEN ADULTS (12 WOMEN AND 1 MAN, WITH A MEAN AGE+/-STANDARD DEVIATION OF 72+/-6.9 YEARS) COMPLETED THE STUDY. RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS HAD MINIMAL TO NO YOGA EXPERIENCE. INTERVENTIONS: A 12-WEEK, 60-MINUTE, BIWEEKLY KRIPALU YOGA CLASS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS. OUTCOME MEASURES: POSTURAL CONTROL (MBT), MOBILITY (TIMED UP AND GO TEST), AND GAIT SPEED (NORMAL AND FAST) WERE ASSESSED. RESULTS: ALL 13 PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED AT LEAST 19 OF THE 24 CLASSES (80% ATTENDANCE). STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE SEEN IN THE MBT (P=0.039), NORMAL GAIT SPEED (P=0.015), FAST GAIT SPEED (P=0.001), TIMED UP AND GO TEST (P=0.045), AND TIMED UP AND GO DUAL-TASK (P=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: IMPROVEMENTS IN POSTURAL CONTROL AND MOBILITY AS MEASURED BY THE MBT AND TIMED UP AND GO GAIT AS MEASURED BY FAST GAIT SPEED INDICATE THAT RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS BENEFITTED FROM THE THERAPEUTIC YOGA INTERVENTION. THE YOGA PROGRAM DESIGNED FOR THIS STUDY INCLUDED ACTIVITIES IN STANDING, SITTING, AND LYING ON THE FLOOR AND MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING MOBILITY, POSTURAL CONTROL, AND GAIT SPEED IN COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
16 1869  39 RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED, SIX-MONTH TRIAL OF YOGA IN HEALTHY SENIORS: EFFECTS ON COGNITION AND QUALITY OF LIFE. CONTEXT: THERE ARE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF MIND-BODY TECHNIQUES ON COGNITIVE FUNCTION BECAUSE THE TECHNIQUES INVOLVE AN ACTIVE ATTENTIONAL OR MINDFULNESS COMPONENT, BUT THIS HAS NOT BEEN FULLY EXPLORED. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON COGNITIVE FUNCTION, FATIGUE, MOOD, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN SENIORS. DESIGN: RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING YOGA, EXERCISE, AND WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUPS. PARTICIPANTS: ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-FIVE GENERALLY HEALTHY MEN AND WOMEN AGED 65-85 YEARS. INTERVENTION: PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO 6 MONTHS OF HATHA YOGA CLASS, WALKING EXERCISE CLASS, OR WAIT-LIST CONTROL. SUBJECTS ASSIGNED TO CLASSES ALSO WERE ASKED TO PRACTICE AT HOME. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: OUTCOME ASSESSMENTS PERFORMED AT BASELINE AND AFTER THE 6-MONTH PERIOD INCLUDED A BATTERY OF COGNITIVE MEASURES FOCUSED ON ATTENTION AND ALERTNESS, THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES BEING PERFORMANCE ON THE STROOP TEST AND A QUANTITATIVE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM (EEG) MEASURE OF ALERTNESS; SF-36 HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE; PROFILE OF MOOD STATES; MULTI-DIMENSIONAL FATIGUE INVENTORY; AND PHYSICAL MEASURES RELATED TO THE INTERVENTIONS. RESULTS: ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-FIVE SUBJECTS WERE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED. SEVENTEEN SUBJECTS DID NOT FINISH THE 6-MONTH INTERVENTION. THERE WERE NO EFFECTS FROM EITHER OF THE ACTIVE INTERVENTIONS ON ANY OF THE COGNITIVE AND ALERTNESS OUTCOME MEASURES. THE YOGA INTERVENTION PRODUCED IMPROVEMENTS IN PHYSICAL MEASURES (EG, TIMED 1-LEGGED STANDING, FORWARD FLEXIBILITY) AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF QUALITY-OF-LIFE MEASURES RELATED TO SENSE OF WELL-BEING AND ENERGY AND FATIGUE COMPARED TO CONTROLS. CONCLUSIONS: THERE WERE NO RELATIVE IMPROVEMENTS OF COGNITIVE FUNCTION AMONG HEALTHY SENIORS IN THE YOGA OR EXERCISE GROUP COMPARED TO THE WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP. THOSE IN THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN QUALITY-OF-LIFE AND PHYSICAL MEASURES COMPARED TO EXERCISE AND WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUPS.	2006	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
17 2060  42 THE BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR WOMEN VETERANS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. OBJECTIVES: CHRONIC LOW BACK (CLBP) PAIN IS PREVALENT AMONG MILITARY VETERANS AND OFTEN LEADS TO FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS, PSYCHOLOGIC SYMPTOMS, LOWER QUALITY OF LIFE, AND HIGHER HEALTH CARE COSTS. AN INCREASING PROPORTION OF U.S. VETERANS ARE WOMEN, AND WOMEN VETERANS MAY HAVE DIFFERENT HEALTH CARE NEEDS THAN MEN VETERANS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF A YOGA INTERVENTION ON WOMEN AND MEN WITH CLBP. SUBJECTS/SETTING/INTERVENTION: VA PATIENTS WITH CLBP WERE REFERRED BY PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS TO A CLINICAL YOGA PROGRAM. DESIGN: RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED A BRIEF BATTERY OF QUESTIONNAIRES BEFORE THEIR FIRST YOGA CLASS AND AGAIN 10 WEEKS LATER IN A SINGLE-GROUP, PRE-POST STUDY DESIGN. OUTCOME MEASURES: QUESTIONNAIRES INCLUDED MEASURES OF PAIN (PAIN SEVERITY SCALE), DEPRESSION (CESD-10), ENERGY/FATIGUE, AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (SF-12). YOGA ATTENDANCE AND HOME PRACTICE OF YOGA WERE ALSO MEASURED. REPEATED-MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE WAS USED TO ANALYZE GROUP DIFFERENCES OVER TIME WHILE CONTROLLING FOR BASELINE DIFFERENCES. RESULTS: THE 53 PARTICIPANTS WHO COMPLETED BOTH ASSESSMENTS HAD A MEAN AGE OF 53 YEARS, AND WERE WELL EDUCATED, 41% NONWHITE, 49% MARRIED, AND HAD VARYING EMPLOYMENT STATUS. WOMEN PARTICIPANTS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER DECREASES IN DEPRESSION (P=0.046) AND PAIN "ON AVERAGE" (P=0.050), AND LARGER INCREASES IN ENERGY (P=0.034) AND SF-12 MENTAL HEALTH (P=0.044) THAN MEN WHO PARTICIPATED. THE GROUPS DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY ON YOGA ATTENDANCE OR HOME PRACTICE OF YOGA. CONCLUSIONS: THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT WOMEN VETERANS MAY BENEFIT MORE THAN MEN VETERANS FROM YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR CHRONIC BACK PAIN. CONCLUSIONS ARE TENTATIVE BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SAMPLE SIZE AND QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY DESIGN. A MORE RIGOROUS STUDY IS BEING DESIGNED TO ANSWER THESE RESEARCH QUESTIONS MORE DEFINITIVELY.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
18 1822  35 PROTOCOL TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF YOGA SUPPLEMENTATION ON COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN SCHIZOPHRENIA: A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: SCHIZOPHRENIA (SZ) IS A CHRONIC ILLNESS THAT IS TREATED SYMPTOMATICALLY. COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION IS A CORE FEATURE OF SZ THAT IS RELATIVELY INTRACTABLE TO PHARMACOTHERAPY. YOGA CAN IMPROVE COGNITIVE FUNCTION AMONG HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS. A RECENT OPEN TRIAL INDICATED SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS OF YOGA TRAINING (YT) IN CONJUNCTION WITH CONVENTIONAL PHARMACOTHERAPY AMONG PATIENTS WITH SZ. AIMS: TO DESCRIBE THE PROTOCOL FOR AN ONGOING RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL DESIGNED TO TEST WHETHER THE REPORTED BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YT ON COGNITIVE FUNCTION AMONG SZ PATIENTS CAN BE REPLICATED. SECONDARILY, THE EFFECTS OF YT ON DAILY FUNCTIONING LIVING SKILLS ARE EVALUATED. METHODS: CONSENTING PATIENTS WITH SZ RECEIVE ROUTINE CLINICAL TREATMENT AND ARE RANDOMISED TO ADJUNCTIVE YT, ADJUNCTIVE PHYSICAL EXERCISE (PE) OR TREATMENT AS USUAL (PROPOSED N = 234 TOTAL, N = 78 IN EACH GROUP). THE TRIAL INVOLVES YT OR PE 5 DAYS A WEEK AND LASTS 3 WEEKS. PARTICIPANTS ARE EVALUATED THRICE OVER 6 MONTHS. COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS MEASURED BY TRAIL MAKING TEST, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA NEUROCOGNITIVE COMPUTERISED BATTERY WERE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES WHILE CLINICAL SEVERITY AND DAILY FUNCTIONING MEASURED BY INDEPENDENT LIVING SKILLS SURVEY WERE SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 309 PARTICIPANTS HAVE BEEN RANDOMISED AS OF 31 AUGUST 2013, WHICH EXCEEDED BEYOND 294 PROPOSED AFTER ATTRITION. ONCE PARTICIPANTS BEGIN YT OR PE THEY GENERALLY COMPLETE THE PROTOCOL. NO INJURIES HAVE BEEN REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS: SHORT TERM YT IS FEASIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE TO INDIAN SZ PATIENTS. IF BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YT ARE DETECTED, IT WILL PROVIDE A NOVEL ADJUNCTIVE COGNITIVE REMEDIATION STRATEGY FOR SZ PATIENTS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
19 1240  40 FEASIBILITY OF A MINDFUL YOGA PROGRAM FOR WOMEN WITH METASTATIC BREAST CANCER: RESULTS OF A RANDOMIZED PILOT STUDY. PURPOSE: PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC BREAST CANCER (MBC) EXPERIENCE HIGH LEVELS OF SYMPTOMS. YOGA INTERVENTIONS HAVE SHOWN PROMISE FOR IMPROVING CANCER SYMPTOMS BUT HAVE RARELY BEEN TESTED IN PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED DISEASE. THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE ACCEPTABILITY OF A COMPREHENSIVE YOGA PROGRAM FOR MBC AND THE FEASIBILITY OF CONDUCTING A RANDOMIZED TRIAL TESTING THE INTERVENTION. METHODS: SIXTY-THREE WOMEN WITH MBC WERE RANDOMIZED WITH A 2:1 ALLOCATION TO YOGA OR A SUPPORT GROUP COMPARISON CONDITION. BOTH INTERVENTIONS INVOLVED EIGHT WEEKLY GROUP SESSIONS. FEASIBILITY WAS QUANTIFIED USING RATES OF ACCRUAL, ATTRITION, AND SESSION ATTENDANCE. ACCEPTABILITY WAS ASSESSED WITH A STANDARDIZED SELF-REPORT MEASURE. PAIN, FATIGUE, SLEEP QUALITY, PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, MINDFULNESS, AND FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE, POST-INTERVENTION, AND 3 AND 6 MONTHS POST-INTERVENTION. RESULTS: WE MET GOALS FOR ACCRUAL AND RETENTION, WITH 50% OF ELIGIBLE PATIENTS ENROLLED AND 87% OF RANDOMIZED PARTICIPANTS COMPLETING POST-INTERVENTION SURVEYS. SIXTY-FIVE PERCENT OF WOMEN IN THE YOGA CONDITION AND 90% IN THE SUPPORT GROUP ATTENDED >/= 4 SESSIONS. EIGHTY PERCENT OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA CONDITION AND 65% IN THE SUPPORT GROUP INDICATED THAT THEY WERE HIGHLY SATISFIED WITH THE INTERVENTION. FOLLOWING TREATMENT, WOMEN IN THE YOGA INTERVENTION HAD MODEST IMPROVEMENTS IN SOME OUTCOMES; HOWEVER, OVERALL SYMPTOM LEVELS WERE LOW FOR WOMEN IN BOTH CONDITIONS. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE YOGA INTERVENTION CONTENT WAS HIGHLY ACCEPTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH MBC, BUT THAT THERE ARE CHALLENGES TO IMPLEMENTING AN INTERVENTION INVOLVING EIGHT GROUP-BASED IN-PERSON SESSIONS. ALTERNATIVE MODES OF DELIVERY MAY BE NECESSARY TO REACH PATIENTS MOST IN NEED OF INTERVENTION.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
20  621  38 DEVELOPMENT, VALIDATION, AND FEASIBILITY OF A SCHOOL-BASED SHORT DURATION INTEGRATED CLASSROOM YOGA MODULE: A PILOT STUDY DESIGN. BACKGROUND: THE PRACTICE OF YOGA IS PROVEN TO HAVE PHYSICAL, COGNITIVE AND EMOTIONAL BENEFITS FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN. DESPITE THIS MANY SCHOOLS DO NOT INCLUDE YOGA IN THEIR DAILY SCHEDULE. THE REASONS CITED ARE LACK OF TIME AND RESOURCES. TO OVERCOME THESE PROBLEMS THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE A SHORT DURATION INTEGRATED CLASSROOM YOGA MODULE. THE DESIGN GUIDELINES WERE THAT IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO PRACTICE IN THE CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT AND THAT IT COULD BE LED BY THE CLASS TEACHER. IN THIS WAY THE MODULE WOULD OVERCOME THE PROBLEM OF BOTH TIME AND RESOURCE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE STUDY HAD TWO MAIN PHASES. IN THE FIRST PHASE, SELECTED ICYM PRACTICES BASED ON THE LITERATURE REVIEW WERE VALIDATED BY 21 SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS USING LAWHSE'S CONTENT VALIDITY RATIO (CVR) FORMULA. IN THE SECOND PHASE, A PILOT STUDY USING A PAIRED SAMPLE PREPOST MEASUREMENT DESIGN WAS CARRIED OUT ON 49 HIGH SCHOOL CHILDREN. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN JUNE 2019. THE INTERVENTION PERIOD WAS 1 MONTH, AND THE TEST VARIABLES WERE PHYSICAL FITNESS, COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE, SELF-ESTEEM, EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING, AND PERSONALITY CHARACTERISTIC. PAIRED SAMPLE T-TEST WAS THE ANALYSIS TOOL AND THE SOFTWARE USED WAS THE STATISTICAL PACKAGE FOR THE SOCIAL SCIENCE VERSION 26. RESULTS: IN THE LAWSHE'S CVR ANALYSIS, 17 OUT OF THE 24 PRACTICES TESTED WERE RATED BY EXPERTS AS ESSENTIAL AS WAS THE OVERALL MODULE (CVR SCORE >/=0.429). IN THE PILOT STUDY, THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE POSTMEAN SCORES COMPARED TO PREMEAN SCORES, FOR ALL THE 4 EUROFIT PHYSICAL FITNESS TESTING BATTERY TESTS (P < 0.02), ALL THE THREE SCORES OF THE STROOP COLOR-WORD NAMING TASK (P < 0.001) AND THE ROSENBERG SELF-ESTEEM SCALE (P < 0.008). CONCLUSION: ICYM WAS VALIDATED AND FOUND FEASIBLE BY THE PRESENT STUDY. IT WAS FOUND TO HAVE A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PHYSICAL FITNESS, COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE, AND SELF-ESTEEM VARIABLES. HOWEVER, A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL WITH A LONGER INTERVENTION PERIOD IS NEEDED TO STRENGTHEN THE PRESENT STUDY.	2021

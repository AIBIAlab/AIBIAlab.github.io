1  906 154 EFFECTIVENESS OF APP-BASED YOGA OF IMMORTALS (YOI) INTERVENTION FOR INSOMNIA IN ASIAN POPULATION DURING PANDEMIC RESTRICTIONS. THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) PANDEMIC CREATED SIGNIFICANT PSYCHOLOGICAL CHALLENGES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING STRESS, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, AND INSOMNIA. IN ADDITION, SOCIAL DISTANCING, TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS, AND SPREAD OF DISEASE HAVE RESULTED IN UNIQUE CHALLENGES, CREATING BARRIERS TO HEALTHCARE ACCESS. COMPARED TO THE RATE PRIOR TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CLINICAL INSOMNIA RATES HAVE BEEN REPORTED. WITH WELL-KNOWN LIMITATIONS OF CURRENTLY ESTABLISHED TREATMENTS (E.G., COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY-INSOMNIA (CBT-I), PHARMACOTHERAPY), THERE IS A NEED TO EXPLORE OTHER EFFECTIVE AND SAFE TREATMENT MODALITIES TO TREAT INSOMNIA, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT CAN BE USED REMOTELY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF APP-BASED INTERVENTION TO TREAT INSOMNIA IN THE CURRENT ERA OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC (USING THE YOGA OF IMMORTALS (YOI) APP). THIS PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY WAS APPROVED BY THE INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD. ALL PARTICIPANTS IN THIS STUDY WERE ASKED TO COMPLETE AN ONLINE SURVEY INCLUDING DEMOGRAPHIC DATA AND VALIDATED INSOMNIA SEVERITY INDEX (ISI) AT BASELINE (15 MAY 2020), 4 WEEKS, AND 8 WEEKS AFTER STARTING THE YOI INTERVENTION. SURVEY DATA WAS EXPORTED USING MICROSOFT EXCEL. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS DONE USING THE GRAPHPAD PRISM 8. YOI INTERVENTION SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED THE MEAN ISI SCORES IN ALL CATEGORIES OF INSOMNIA (SEVERE, MODERATE, AND SUBTHRESHOLD) AT EACH FOLLOW-UP (P </= 0.0001). THE IMPROVEMENT WAS SIGNIFICANT AMONG ALL AGE GROUPS AND IN BOTH GENDERS. IN OUR STUDY, YOI WAS A NOVEL AND EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR IMPROVING INSOMNIA SYMPTOMS AND MAY BE A NEW ADDITION TO THE ARMAMENTARIUM OF INSOMNIA MANAGEMENT. BEING APP-BASED, THIS HAS POTENTIAL WIDER APPLICABILITY, ESPECIALLY DURING THE CURRENT COVID-19 PANDEMIC.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
2 2730  54 YOGA OF IMMORTALS INTERVENTION REDUCES SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION, INSOMNIA AND ANXIETY. BACKGROUND: DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND DISORDERED SLEEP ARE SOME COMMON SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH SUB-OPTIMAL MENTAL HEALTH. DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES HAVE GROWN INCREASINGLY MORE PREVALENT IN THE POPULATION. DUE TO SOCIAL DISTANCING AND OTHER LIMITATIONS DURING THE PANDEMIC, THERE IS A NEED FOR HOME-BASED, FLEXIBLE INTERVENTIONS THAT CAN IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH. THE YOGA OF IMMORTALS (YOI) MOBILE APPLICATION PROVIDES A STRUCTURED INTERVENTION THAT CAN BE USED ON ANY MOBILE DEVICE AND APPLIED FROM THE USER'S HOME. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 1,505 PARTICIPANTS WERE ENROLLED IN THE STUDY AND USED THE YOI APP FOR AN 8-WEEK PERIOD. PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO FILL OUT THREE QUESTIONNAIRES: THE PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE, 8 ITEMS (PHQ-8), THE GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER QUESTIONNAIRE (GAD-7) AND THE INSOMNIA SEVERITY INDEX (ISI). THESE THREE ITEMS WERE COMPLETED BY 1,297 PARTICIPANTS A TOTAL OF FOUR TIMES: BEFORE STARTING YOI, TWO MORE TIMES DURING USE, AND A FOURTH TIME AFTER THE 8-WEEK USAGE PERIOD. CHANGES IN PHQ8, GAD7 AND ISI IN PARTICIPANTS WERE COMPARED TO A CONTROL GROUP, WHO DID NOT USE THE YOI APP BUT COMPLETED ALL QUESTIONNAIRES (590 CONTROLS FINISHED ALL QUESTIONNAIRES). RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS REPORTED SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY-RELATED SYMPTOMS. COMPARED TO BASELINE, PHQ-8 SCORES DECREASED 50% ON AVERAGE AFTER THE 8-WEEK PERIOD. GAD-7 SCORES ALSO DECREASED BY 40-50% ON AVERAGE, AND ISI SCORES DECREASED BY 50%. THESE CHANGES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER (P < 0.05) THAN THAT OBSERVED IN THE CONTROL GROUP. PARTICIPANTS WHO REPORTED A PREVIOUS DIAGNOSIS OF DEPRESSION AND GENERALIZED ANXIETY REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER DECREASES IN PHQ-8 AND GAD-7 AS COMPARED TO PARTICIPANTS WITH NO PRIOR DIAGNOSIS (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: REGULAR USE OF THE YOI INTERVENTION OVER AN 8-WEEK PERIOD LED TO SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN SYMPTOMS OF BOTH DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, AS WELL AS ALLEVIATION OF INSOMNIA.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
3 2275  49 THE ROLE OF YOGA IN WORKING FROM HOME DURING THE COVID-19 GLOBAL LOCKDOWN. BACKGROUND: THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS BECOME A MAJOR CAUSE OF STRESS AND ANXIETY WORLDWIDE. DUE TO THE GLOBAL LOCKDOWN, WORK, EMPLOYMENT, BUSINESSES AND THE ECONOMIC CLIMATE HAVE BEEN SEVERELY AFFECTED. IT HAS GENERATED STRESS AMONG PEOPLE FROM ALL SECTIONS OF SOCIETY, ESPECIALLY TO WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED TO CATER TO HEALTHCARE SERVICE OR THOSE CONSTRAINED TO SECURE DAILY ESSENTIAL ITEMS. IT IS WIDELY PERCEIVED THAT ELDERLY OR THOSE AFFECTED BY DIABETES, HYPERTENSION AND OTHER CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES ARE PRONE TO COVID-19. AS PER AN ONGOING SURVEY, THE INITIAL DATA SHOWS THAT THE ABOVE-MENTIONED ANXIETY AND STRESS CAUSE INSOMNIA, AND HAS THE CONSIDERABLE POTENTIAL TO WEAKEN THE IMMUNE SYSTEM, THE SOLE PROTECTION AGAINST THE VIRUS. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON THE NEED OF YOGA PRACTICE AT WORK PLACES AND AT HOME DURING THE GLOBAL LOCKDOWN DUE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. METHODS: LITERATURE WAS SEARCHED USING PUBMED AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR FOR COVID-19-RELATED STRESS AND ANXIETY AT WORK AND SOCIETY DUE TO THE WORLDWIDE LOCKDOWN. THE PREDISPOSING COMORBIDITIES, VIRAL MECHANISM OF ACTION AND TREATMENT REGIMEN WERE ALSO SEARCHED. YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION STUDIES AND ONLINE PROGRAMS WERE ALSO SEARCHED. RESULTS: AS THE LOCKDOWN CANNOT LAST FOREVER AND WORKPLACES WILL HAVE TO BE FUNCTIONAL SOON, THERE IS AN INCREASED POSSIBILITY OF RECURRENT INFECTION. THEREFORE, YOGA CAN PROVIDE THE NECESSARY TOOL FOR RISK REDUCTION, AMELIORATION OF STRESS AND ANXIETY AND STRENGTHENING OF THE IMMUNE FUNCTION. THE ONLINE PLATFORMS PROVIDE A GOOD MEDIA FOR YOGA TRAINING AT WORK PLACES AND HOMES. CONCLUSION: DUE TO SOCIAL DISTANCING NORMS, THE AVAILABILITY OF YOGA TRAINERS HAS BECOME RESTRICTED. YOGA PRACTICE IS ACTIVELY SOUGHT TO ACHIEVE REDUCED ANXIETY AND STRESS SO THAT IMPROVED SLEEP MAY POSITIVELY IMPACT IMMUNITY. AS A CONSEQUENCE, THERE IS A SPURT IN SOCIAL MEDIA, CATERING TO DAILY ONLINE YOGA SESSIONS WHICH APPARENTLY PROVE USEFUL IN PROVIDING ACCESSIBLE MEANS TO ACHIEVE MENTAL AS WELL AS PHYSICAL WELL-BEING.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
4 2013  36 SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA: A BREATH OF HOPE DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC. IMPORTANT COUNTER MEASURES TO COMBAT AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE PANDEMIC INCLUDE VACCINATION, ANTIVIRAL THERAPY, AND IMMUNOMODULATION THERAPY. VACCINATIONS ARE DISEASE SPECIFIC AND MOREOVER STRAIN SPECIFIC, SO THE PROTECTION PROVIDED IS ALSO SPECIFIC AND LIMITED. ANTIVIRAL THERAPIES ARE COSTLY AND REQUIRE BULK PRODUCTION OF DRUGS, HENCE GLOBALLY THERE IS AN INCREASED INTEREST TOWARD LOW-RISK, COST-EFFECTIVE COMPLEMENTARY ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, SUCH AS YOGA AND AYURVEDA TO TACKLE THE INFECTIOUS PANDEMIC, CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19). THERE IS CLINICAL EVIDENCE AVAILABLE ON THE POTENTIAL COMPLEMENTARY ROLE OF YOGIC PRACTICES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF NONCOMMUNICABLE AND COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. VARIOUS ONLINE DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR ARTICLES PUBLISHED BETWEEN 2000 AND 2020. DATABASES EXPLORED WERE MEDLINE, EMBASE, INDIAN CITATION INDEX, PSYCINFO, INDEX MEDICUS FOR SOUTH-EAST ASIA REGION, AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR. ALL SEARCH RESULTS WERE SCREENED, AND ARTICLES RELATED TO KEYWORDS SUCH AS COVID-19, YOGA THERAPY, AND SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA (SKY) WERE SELECTED FOR DATA EXTRACTION. QUALITY OF THE STUDIES INCLUDED WAS EVALUATED ON THE BASIS OF THE CONSTRUCT VALIDITY, CONTENT VALIDITY, RELEVANCE, BIAS, CREDIBILITY RELATING TO INFORMATION, AND DATA SOURCES. SKY IS A UNIQUE YOGIC PRACTICE THAT INCLUDES SPECIFIC SEQUENTIAL BREATHING TECHNIQUES. IT BALANCES THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THUS CAN ALLEVIATE ANXIETY, ROUTINE STRESS, DEPRESSION, STRESS-RELATED MEDICAL DISORDERS, AND POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS. IT POTENTIATES NATURAL HOST IMMUNE DEFENSES THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO TACKLE A PLETHORA OF MICROBIAL INFECTIONS. THIS NARRATIVE REVIEW ARTICLE PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS THAT SKY CAN OFFER TO THE POPULATION AT LARGE DURING THIS COVID-19 PANDEMIC.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
5 2031  43 TAILORED INDIVIDUAL YOGA PRACTICE IMPROVES SLEEP QUALITY, FATIGUE, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION IN CHRONIC INSOMNIA DISORDER. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC INSOMNIA DISORDER (CI) IS A PREVALENT SLEEP DISORDER THAT CAN LEAD TO DISTURBED DAYTIME FUNCTIONING AND IS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. FIRST-CHOICE TREATMENT IS COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT-I). OTHER MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS TAI-CHI AND YOGA, HAVE DEMONSTRATED SUBJECTIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN SLEEP QUALITY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR IMPROVEMENT OF SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE SLEEP QUALITY AS WELL AS MEASURES OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, SLEEPINESS, AND FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH CI. METHODS: ADULTS WITH CI WERE PROSPECTIVELY INCLUDED IN THIS SINGLE GROUP PRE-POST STUDY. BASELINE ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED HOME POLYSOMNOGRAPHY (PSG), 7-DAY ACTIGRAPHY, AND QUESTIONNAIRES (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX QUESTIONNAIRE (PSQI), HOSPITAL ANXIETY DEPRESSION SCALE (HADS), EPWORTH SLEEPINESS SCALE (ESS), PICHOT FATIGUE SCALE (PS)). PATIENTS PRACTICED VINIYOGA, AN INDIVIDUALISED YOGA PRACTICE WITH DAILY SELF-ADMINISTERED EXERCISES, FOR 14 WEEKS. ASSESSMENTS WERE REPEATED AT THE END OF YOGA PRACTICE. RESULTS: TWENTY-ONE PATIENTS COMPLETED THE STUDY. OBJECTIVE SLEEP MEASUREMENTS REVEALED NO CHANGE IN PSG PARAMETERS AFTER YOGA PRACTICE, BUT A DECREASE IN AROUSALS ON ACTIGRAPHY (P < 0.001). SUBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS IMPROVED FOR ALL QUESTIONNAIRES (PSQI, P < 0.001; HAD-A, P = 0.020, HAD-D, P = 0.001, ESS, P = 0.041, PS, P = 0.010). IN UNIVARIATE CORRELATIONS, DECREASE IN PSQI WAS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASE IN SLEEP STAGE N3 (P < 0.001) ON PSG. CONCLUSIONS: WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED A POSITIVE IMPACT OF INDIVIDUALIZED YOGA PRACTICE ON SUBJECTIVE PARAMETERS RELATED TO SLEEP AND DAYTIME SYMPTOMS IN CI, RESULTING IN FEWER AROUSALS ON ACTIGRAPHY. YOGA COULD BE PROPOSED AS A POTENTIALLY USEFUL ALTERNATIVE TO CBT-I IN CI, AS IT IS EASY TO PRACTICE AUTONOMOUSLY OVER THE LONG-TERM. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE DESIGN OF THE PRESENT STUDY, FUTURE PROSPECTIVE CONTROLLED STUDIES SHOULD FIRST CONFIRM OUR RESULTS.

6 2854  37 YOGA- AND MEDITATION-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION INCREASES NEUROPLASTICITY AND REDUCES SEVERITY OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: CURRENT INTERVENTIONS FOR MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD) ARE SUBOPTIMAL, AND ONLY ONE THIRD RESPOND TO THEM ON INITIAL TREATMENT. NEUROPLASTICITY THEORIES ARE THE BASIS FOR SEVERAL EMERGING TREATMENTS. EVIDENCE ON THE IMPACT OF YOGA, A WELL-KNOWN MIND-BODY INTERVENTION, ON NEUROPLASTICITY IN MDD IS LIMITED. OBJECTIVES: TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF 12-WEEK YOGA- AND MEDITATION-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION (YMLI) ON DEPRESSION SEVERITY AND SYSTEMIC BIOMARKERS OF NEUROPLASTICITY IN ADULT MDD PATIENTS ON ROUTINE DRUG TREATMENT. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 58 MDD PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO YOGA OR CONTROL GROUP. THE SEVERITY OF DEPRESSION WAS ASSESSED WITH BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY-II SCALE (BDI-II). BLOOD SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED BEFORE AND AFTER INTERVENTION FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF THE BIOMARKERS THAT CHARACTERIZE NEUROPLASTICITY, INCLUDING MIND-BODY COMMUNICATIVE AND CELLULAR HEALTH BIOMARKERS. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE [DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEANS, (95% CI)] IN BDI-II SCORE [-5.83 (-7.27, -4.39), P < 0.001] AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN BDNF (NG/ML) [5.48 (3.50, 7.46), P < 0.001] AFTER YMLI COMPARED TO CONTROL GROUP. YMLI SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED DHEAS, SIRTUIN 1, AND TELOMERASE ACTIVITY LEVELS, AND DECREASED CORTISOL, AND IL-6 LEVELS, IN ADDITION TO DECREASING DNA DAMAGE AND BALANCING OXIDATIVE STRESS. MULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSES WERE USED TO ASSOCIATE NEUROPLASTICITY BIOMARKERS WITH DEPRESSION SEVERITY. A 'POST-INTERVENTION CHANGE IN BDNF' X 'GROUP' INTERACTION INDICATED THAT YOGA GROUP HAD MORE BDNF IN ASSOCIATION WITH LESS BDI-II SCORES RELATIVE TO CONTROLS. INCREASED SIRTUIN 1 AND TELOMERASE ACTIVITY AND DECREASED CORTISOL SIGNIFICANTLY PREDICTED THIS ASSOCIATION (ALL P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT DECREASE IN DEPRESSION SEVERITY AFTER YMLI IN MDD IS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED SYSTEMIC BIOMARKERS OF NEUROPLASTICITY. THUS YMLI CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION IN MDD MANAGEMENT.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
7  360  34 ASSOCIATION OF YOGA PRACTICE AND SERUM CORTISOL LEVELS IN CHRONIC PERIODONTITIS PATIENTS WITH STRESS-RELATED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. AIM: REDUCING THE PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS BY VARIOUS METHODS CAN IMPROVE OVERALL HEALTH, AND YOGA IS NOW CONSIDERED AS AN EASILY AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVE METHOD. THE PRESENT CROSS-SECTIONAL PILOT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED MAINLY TO FIND THE ASSOCIATION OF YOGA PRACTICE WITH PERIODONTAL DISEASE BY MEASURING SERUM CORTISOL LEVELS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 70 SUBJECTS WITH AGE RANGE OF 35-60 YEARS SUFFERING WITH CHRONIC PERIODONTITIS WERE DIVIDED INTO GROUP I (WITH STRESS), GROUP II (WITHOUT STRESS), AND GROUP III (PRACTICING YOGA). PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION WAS CARRIED OUT USING HAMILTON ANXIETY RATING SCALE (HAM-A) AND ZUNG SELF-RATING DEPRESSION SCALE (ZSDS). PERIODONTAL PARAMETERS LIKE PLAQUE INDEX (PI), PROBING POCKET DEPTH (PPD), AND CLINICAL ATTACHMENT LEVEL (CAL) AT 5-8 MM AND >8 MM WERE RECORDED. BLOOD SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED AND SERUM CORTISOL LEVELS WERE MEASURED. RESULTS: MEAN AGE, PLAQUE SCORES, AND NUMBER OF TEETH WITH PPD AND CAL AT 5-8 MM AND >8 MM WERE SIMILAR IN ALL THE GROUPS, EXCEPT BETWEEN GROUP I AND GROUP III WHERE A MULTIPLE COMPARISON WITH TUKEY'S POST-HOC TEST SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN PLAQUE INDEX (P < 0.038) AND THE NUMBER OF TEETH WITH CAL 5-8 MM (P < 0.016). SERUM CORTISOL LEVELS AND HAM-A SCALE AND ZSDS SCORES SHOWED HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT VALUE (P < 0.001) IN GROUP I SUBJECTS WHEN COMPARED WITH GROUP II AND GROUP III SUBJECTS. CONCLUSION: CROSS-SECTIONAL OBSERVATION DONE AMONG THREE GROUPS SHOWED THAT INDIVIDUALS PRACTICING YOGA REGULARLY HAD LOW SERUM CORTISOL LEVELS, HAM-A SCALE AND ZSDS SCORES, AND BETTER PERIODONTAL HEALTH.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
8 2731  32 YOGA OFFERS CARDIOVASCULAR PROTECTION IN EARLY POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. CONTEXT: POSTMENOPAUSE, AN ESTROGEN DEFICIENT STATE COMES WITH INCREASED INCIDENCE OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES (CVDS). YOGA HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS HAVING A BENEFICIAL EFFECT ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV), A MARKER FOR CARDIAC AUTONOMIC ACTIVITY WHICH CAN ASSESS CARDIOVASCULAR RISK, IN VARIOUS POPULATIONS. AIM: THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF 3-MONTH LONG YOGA PRACTICE ON HRV IN EARLY POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A PROSPECTIVE LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF 67 WOMEN WITHIN 5 YEARS OF MENOPAUSE BETWEEN 45 AND 60 YEARS OF AGE ATTENDING MENOPAUSE CLINIC OF DEPARTMENT OF GYNAECOLOGY, SUCHETA KRIPLANI HOSPITAL FULFILLING INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA AND CONSENTING WERE ENROLLED FOR THE STUDY. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: HRV OF 37 CASES (YOGA GROUP) AND 30 CONTROLS (NON-YOGA GROUP) WAS RECORDED PRE AND 3-MONTH POSTINTERVENTION. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: GRAPHPAD PRISM VERSION 5 SOFTWARE WAS USED. VALUES ARE A MEAN AND STANDARD ERROR OF MEAN. STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE WAS SET UP AT P < 0.05.

9 1718  40 PERCEIVED STRESS, RESILIENCE, WELL-BEING, AND COVID 19 RESPONSE IN ISHA YOGA PRACTITIONERS COMPARED TO MATCHED CONTROLS: A RESEARCH PROTOCOL. OBJECTIVES: THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT STRESSOR WORLDWIDE AND REPORTS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, DEPRESSION, SEDENTARY LIFESTYLES, AND OVERALL DECREASED WELLBEING ARE INCREASING. YOGA PRACTICES HAVE BEEN FOUND TO IMPROVE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH. THE PURPOSE OF THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IS TO COMPARE ISHA YOGA PRACTITIONERS TO CONTROLS ON PERCEIVED STRESS, RESILIENCE, WELLBEING, AND PROTECTION AND RECOVERY FROM COVID-19. TRIAL DESIGN. IN THIS PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL, THE EFFECTS OF YOGA PRACTICES ARE BEING COMPARED BETWEEN SEASONED YOGA PRACTITIONERS WITH TWO CONTROLS WHO ARE AGE (+/-3 YEARS), GENDER MATCHED, AND LIVING IN THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WILL BE ASKED TO COMPLETE A SERIES OF WEB-BASED SURVEYS AT BASELINE, SIX WEEKS, AND 12 WEEKS. THESE SURVEYS INCLUDE VALIDATED SCALES AND OBJECTIVE QUESTIONS ON COVID-19 INFECTION AND MEDICAL HISTORY. THE VALIDATED QUESTIONNAIRES ASSESS STRESS, MOOD STATES, RESILIENCE, AND OVERALL WELLBEING. QUESTIONNAIRES, WEEKLY ACTIVITY DIARIES, AND MEDICAL HISTORY, WILL BE COLLECTED USING REDCAP. RESULTS: WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT ROUTINE YOGA PRACTICE DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC WILL REDUCE STRESS, ENHANCE WELL-BEING, AND PROVIDE PROTECTIVE EFFECTS AGAINST COVID-19. CONCLUSION: WITH THE GROWING CONCERN ABOUT THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL IMPACTS OF COVID-19 AND INCREASED INTEREST IN ALTERNATIVE PRACTICES SUCH AS YOGIC PRACTICES, THIS STUDY WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE ABOUT THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR EMOTIONAL, MENTAL, AND PHYSICAL HEALTH CONDITIONS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
10 2093  33 THE EFFECT OF YOCAS(C)(R) YOGA FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS ON HORMONAL THERAPY. UP TO 50% OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS ON AROMATASE INHIBITOR THERAPY REPORT MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS SUCH AS JOINT AND MUSCLE PAIN, SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTING TREATMENT ADHERENCE AND DISCONTINUATION RATES. WE CONDUCTED A SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS OF A NATIONWIDE, MULTI-SITE, PHASE II/III RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED, CLINICAL TRIAL EXAMINING THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR IMPROVING MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS CURRENTLY RECEIVING HORMONE THERAPY (AROMATASE INHIBITORS [AI] OR TAMOXIFEN [TAM]). BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS CURRENTLY RECEIVING AI (N = 95) OR TAM (N = 72) WITH NO PARTICIPATION IN YOGA DURING THE PREVIOUS 3 MONTHS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO 2 ARMS: (1) STANDARD CARE MONITORING AND (2) STANDARD CARE PLUS THE 4-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION (2X/WEEK; 75 MIN/SESSION) AND INCLUDED IN THIS ANALYSIS. THE YOGA INTERVENTION UTILIZED THE UR YOGA FOR CANCER SURVIVORS (YOCAS(C)((R))) PROGRAM CONSISTING OF BREATHING EXERCISES, 18 GENTLE HATHA AND RESTORATIVE YOGA POSTURES, AND MEDITATION. MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS WERE ASSESSED PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION. AT BASELINE, AI USERS REPORTED HIGHER LEVELS OF GENERAL PAIN, MUSCLE ACHES, AND TOTAL PHYSICAL DISCOMFORT THAN TAM USERS (ALL P </= 0.05). AMONG ALL BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS ON HORMONAL THERAPY, PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP DEMONSTRATED GREATER REDUCTIONS IN MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS SUCH AS GENERAL PAIN, MUSCLE ACHES AND TOTAL PHYSICAL DISCOMFORT FROM PRE- TO POST-INTERVENTION THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (ALL P </= 0.05). THE SEVERITY OF MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS WAS HIGHER FOR AI USERS COMPARED TO TAM USERS. AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS ON HORMONE THERAPY, THE BRIEF COMMUNITY-BASED YOCAS(C)(R) INTERVENTION SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED GENERAL PAIN, MUSCLE ACHES, AND PHYSICAL DISCOMFORT.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
11 1767  38 POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA IN PREGNANCY-RELATED COMPLICATIONS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC AND IMPLICATIONS FOR WORKING WOMEN. BACKGROUND: PREGNANCY IS A VULNERABLE PERIOD OF GROWTH AND ENRICHMENT ALONG WITH MANY PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CHALLENGES. THESE CHANGES CAN LEAD TO COMPLICATIONS IF COMPOUNDED BY EXTERNAL STRESS AND ANXIETY. COVID-19 HAS EMERGED AS A CHIEF STRESSOR AMONG THE GENERAL POPULATION AND IS A SERIOUS THREAT AMONG VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. THEREFORE, THERE IS A NEED FOR STRESS MANAGEMENT TOOLS, SUCH AS YOGA AND PHYSICAL EXERCISES, BOTH AT HOME AND AT WORK. THESE CAN BE ADOPTED DURING THE PANDEMIC WITH PROPER MAINTENANCE OF SOCIAL DISTANCING. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE AND COMPILE LITERATURE THAT HAS REPORTED THE HEALTH OUTCOMES OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON PREGNANCY AT THE WORKPLACE AND ANALYZES BOTH THE RESTRICTIONS AS WELL AS ADVANTAGES OF ITS BENEFICIAL EFFECTS IN COMPARISON TO PHYSICAL EXERCISES. METHODOLOGY: A COMPREHENSIVE LITERATURE REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED UTILIZING PUBMED AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR. THE KEYWORDS USED FOR THE SEARCH INCLUDE "YOGA", "WORK", "COMPLICATIONS", "PHYSICAL EXERCISE", "DRUGS" AND "COVID" INDIFFERENT PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS WITH "PREGNANCY". WE COMPILED THE LITERATURE WITH RESPECT TO PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS AND THE EFFECTS OF DRUGS, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND YOGA FOR PREVENTING THESE COMPLICATIONS. RESULTS: WE NOTED THAT PREGNANCY-RELATED COMPLICATIONS ARE BECOMING MORE PREVALENT BECAUSE OF A SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE, RESTRICTED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND GROWING STRESS. IN SUCH SITUATIONS, A HOME OR WORKPLACE YOGA PROTOCOL CAN COMBINE BOTH EXERCISE AND MINDFULNESS-BASED ALLEVIATION OF ANXIETY FOR BOTH WORKING AND NON-WORKING WOMEN. CONCLUSION: YOGA CAN BE EFFECTIVE FOR COMBATING STRESS AND ANXIETY BESIDES BOOSTING IMMUNITY IN PREGNANT WORKING WOMEN CONFRONTED WITH THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
12  524  36 COMPARISON OF COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY AND YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF LATE-LIFE WORRY: A RANDOMIZED PREFERENCE TRIAL. BACKGROUND: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT) AND YOGA ON LATE-LIFE WORRY, ANXIETY, AND SLEEP; AND EXAMINE PREFERENCE AND SELECTION EFFECTS ON THESE OUTCOMES. METHODS: A RANDOMIZED PREFERENCE TRIAL OF CBT AND YOGA WAS CONDUCTED IN COMMUNITY-DWELLING ADULTS 60 YEARS OR OLDER, WHO SCORED 26 OR ABOVE ON THE PENN STATE WORRY QUESTIONNAIRE-ABBREVIATED (PSWQ-A). CBT CONSISTED OF 10 WEEKLY TELEPHONE SESSIONS. YOGA CONSISTED OF 20 BIWEEKLY GROUP YOGA CLASSES. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS WORRY (PSWQ-A); THE SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE ANXIETY (PROMIS-ANXIETY) AND SLEEP (INSOMNIA SEVERITY INDEX [ISI]). WE EXAMINED BOTH PREFERENCE EFFECTS (AVERAGE EFFECT FOR THOSE WHO RECEIVED THEIR PREFERRED INTERVENTION [REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT WAS CBT OR YOGA] MINUS THE AVERAGE FOR THOSE WHO DID NOT RECEIVE THEIR PREFERRED INTERVENTION [REGARDLESS OF THE INTERVENTION]) AND SELECTION EFFECT (WHICH ADDRESSES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THERE IS A BENEFIT TO GETTING TO SELECT ONE INTERVENTION OVER THE OTHER, AND MEASURES THE EFFECT ON OUTCOMES OF SELF-SELECTION TO A SPECIFIC INTERVENTION). RESULTS: FIVE HUNDRED OLDER ADULTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO THE RANDOMIZED TRIAL (125 EACH IN CBT AND YOGA) OR THE PREFERENCE TRIAL (120 CHOSE CBT; 130 CHOSE YOGA). IN THE RANDOMIZED TRIAL, THE INTERVENTION EFFECT OF YOGA COMPARED WITH CBT ADJUSTED FOR BASELINE PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION USE, GENDER, AND RACE WAS 1.6 (-0.2, 3.3), P = .08 FOR THE PSWQ-A. SIMILAR RESULTS WERE OBSERVED WITH PROMIS-ANXIETY (ADJUSTED INTERVENTION EFFECT: 0.3 [-1.5, 2.2], P = .71). PARTICIPANTS RANDOMIZED TO CBT EXPERIENCED A GREATER REDUCTION IN THE ISI COMPARED WITH YOGA (ADJUSTED INTERVENTION EFFECT: 2.4 [1.2, 3.7], P < .01]). ESTIMATED IN THE COMBINED DATA SET (N = 500), THE PREFERENCE AND SELECTION EFFECTS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR THE PSWQ-A, PROMIS-ANXIETY, AND ISI. OF THE 52 ADVERSE EVENTS, ONLY TWO WERE POSSIBLY RELATED TO THE INTERVENTION. NONE OF THE 26 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS WERE RELATED TO THE STUDY INTERVENTIONS. CONCLUSIONS: CBT AND YOGA WERE BOTH EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING LATE-LIFE WORRY AND ANXIETY. HOWEVER, A GREATER IMPACT WAS SEEN FOR CBT COMPARED WITH YOGA FOR IMPROVING SLEEP. NEITHER PREFERENCE NOR SELECTION EFFECTS WAS FOUND.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
13 1911  23 ROLE OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE IN THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC - A NARRATIVE REVIEW. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS POSED AN IMMENSE CHALLENGE TO HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AROUND THE GLOBE IN TERMS OF LIMITED HEALTH CARE FACILITIES AND PROVEN MEDICAL THERAPEUTICS TO ADDRESS THE SYMPTOMS OF THE INFECTION. THE CURRENT HEALTH CARE STRATEGIES ARE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON EITHER THE PATHOGEN OR THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. HOWEVER, EFFORTS TOWARDS STRENGTHENING THE HOST IMMUNITY ARE IMPORTANT FROM PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF INFECTION AND DOWNREGULATE THE POTENCY OF THE INFECTIOUS AGENT. WHILE A VACCINE CAN INDUCE SPECIFIC IMMUNITY IN THE HOST, NON-SPECIFIC WAYS OF IMPROVING OVERALL HOST IMMUNITY ARE NEEDED AS WELL. THIS SCENARIO HAS PAVED THE WAY FOR THE USE OF TRADITIONAL INDIAN THERAPIES SUCH AS AYURVEDA AND YOGA. THIS REVIEW AIMS AT COLLATING AVAILABLE EVIDENCE ON AYURVEDA, YOGA, AND COVID-19. FURTHER, IT DRAWS INFERENCES FROM RECENT STUDIES ON YOGA AND AYURVEDA ON IMMUNITY, RESPIRATORY HEALTH, AND MENTAL HEALTH RESPECTIVELY TO APPROXIMATE ITS PROBABLE ROLE IN PROPHYLAXIS AND AS AN ADD-ON MANAGEMENT OPTION FOR THE CURRENT PANDEMIC.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
14 2836  25 YOGA'S IMPACT ON INFLAMMATION, MOOD, AND FATIGUE IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. PURPOSE: TO EVALUATE YOGA'S IMPACT ON INFLAMMATION, MOOD, AND FATIGUE. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED 3-MONTH TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED WITH TWO POST-TREATMENT ASSESSMENTS OF 200 BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS ASSIGNED TO EITHER 12 WEEKS OF 90-MINUTE TWICE PER WEEK HATHA YOGA CLASSES OR A WAIT-LIST CONTROL. THE MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES WERE LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE-STIMULATED PRODUCTION OF PROINFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES INTERLEUKIN-6 (IL-6), TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR ALPHA (TNF-ALPHA), AND INTERLEUKIN-1BETA (IL-1BETA), AND SCORES ON THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL FATIGUE SYMPTOM INVENTORY-SHORT FORM (MFSI-SF), THE VITALITY SCALE FROM THE MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY 36-ITEM SHORT FORM (SF-36), AND THE CENTER FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES-DEPRESSION (CES-D) SCALE. RESULTS: IMMEDIATELY POST-TREATMENT, FATIGUE WAS NOT LOWER (P > .05) BUT VITALITY WAS HIGHER (P = .01) IN THE YOGA GROUP COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. AT 3 MONTHS POST-TREATMENT, FATIGUE WAS LOWER IN THE YOGA GROUP (P = .002), VITALITY WAS HIGHER (P = .01), AND IL-6 (P = .027), TNF-ALPHA (P = .027), AND IL-1BETA (P = .037) WERE LOWER FOR YOGA PARTICIPANTS COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. GROUPS DID NOT DIFFER ON DEPRESSION AT EITHER TIME (P > .2). PLANNED SECONDARY ANALYSES SHOWED THAT THE FREQUENCY OF YOGA PRACTICE HAD STRONGER ASSOCIATIONS WITH FATIGUE AT BOTH POST-TREATMENT VISITS (P = .019; P < .001), AS WELL AS VITALITY (P = .016; P = .0045), BUT NOT DEPRESSION (P > .05) THAN SIMPLE GROUP ASSIGNMENT; MORE FREQUENT PRACTICE PRODUCED LARGER CHANGES. AT 3 MONTHS POST-TREATMENT, INCREASING YOGA PRACTICE ALSO LED TO A DECREASE IN IL-6 (P = .01) AND IL-1BETA (P = .03) PRODUCTION BUT NOT IN TNF-ALPHA PRODUCTION (P > .05). CONCLUSION: CHRONIC INFLAMMATION MAY FUEL DECLINES IN PHYSICAL FUNCTION LEADING TO FRAILTY AND DISABILITY. IF YOGA DAMPENS OR LIMITS BOTH FATIGUE AND INFLAMMATION, THEN REGULAR PRACTICE COULD HAVE SUBSTANTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
15 2320  38 TREATMENT CREDIBILITY, EXPECTANCY, AND PREFERENCE: PREDICTION OF TREATMENT ENGAGEMENT AND OUTCOME IN A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL OF HATHA YOGA VS. HEALTH EDUCATION AS ADJUNCT TREATMENTS FOR DEPRESSION. BACKGROUND: HATHA YOGA MAY BE HELPFUL FOR ALLEVIATING DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ANALYSIS IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER TREATMENT PROGRAM PREFERENCE, CREDIBILITY, OR EXPECTANCY PREDICT ENGAGEMENT IN DEPRESSION INTERVENTIONS (YOGA OR A CONTROL CLASS) OR DEPRESSION SYMPTOM SEVERITY OVER TIME. METHODS: THIS IS A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) OF HATHA YOGA VS. A HEALTH EDUCATION CONTROL GROUP FOR TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION. DEPRESSED PARTICIPANTS (N=122) ATTENDED UP TO 20 CLASSES OVER A PERIOD OF 10 WEEKS, AND THEN COMPLETED ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENTS AFTER 3 AND 6 MONTHS. WE ASSESSED TREATMENT PREFERENCE PRIOR TO RANDOMIZATION, AND TREATMENT CREDIBILITY AND EXPECTANCY AFTER PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED THEIR FIRST CLASS. TREATMENT "CONCORDANCE" INDICATED THAT TREATMENT PREFERENCE MATCHED ASSIGNED TREATMENT. RESULTS: TREATMENT CREDIBILITY, EXPECTANCY, AND CONCORDANCE WERE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH TREATMENT ENGAGEMENT. TREATMENT EXPECTANCY MODERATED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN TREATMENT GROUP AND DEPRESSION. DEPRESSION SEVERITY OVER TIME DIFFERED BY EXPECTANCY LEVEL FOR THE YOGA GROUP BUT NOT FOR THE HEALTH EDUCATION GROUP. CONTROLLING FOR BASELINE DEPRESSION, PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP WITH AN AVERAGE OR HIGH EXPECTANCY FOR IMPROVEMENT SHOWED LOWER DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS ACROSS THE ACUTE INTERVENTION AND FOLLOW-UP PERIOD THAN THOSE WITH A LOW EXPECTANCY FOR IMPROVEMENT. THERE WAS A TREND FOR A SIMILAR PATTERN FOR CREDIBILITY. CONCORDANCE WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH TREATMENT OUTCOME. LIMITATIONS: THIS IS A SECONDARY, POST-HOC ANALYSIS AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED HYPOTHESIS-GENERATING. CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS SUGGEST THAT EXPECTANCY IMPROVES THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS ONLY FOR A INTERVENTION THOUGHT TO ACTIVELY TARGET DEPRESSION (YOGA) AND NOT A CONTROL INTERVENTION.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
16 1215  41 EXPLORING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY AND PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES AFTER CANCER TREATMENT: A STUDY PROTOCOL. BACKGROUND: FOLLOWING CANCER TREATMENT, ADULTS COMMONLY REPORT WORSENED PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES (PROS) SUCH AS ANXIETY, STRESS, DEPRESSION, PERSISTENT AND UPSETTING COGNITIVE COMPLAINTS, UNRELENTING FATIGUE, AND REDUCED QUALITY OF LIFE. POORER PROS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DISRUPTED AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM FUNCTIONING AS MEASURED BY HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV), BOTH OF WHICH HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE HRV AND PROS AMONG ADULTS FOLLOWING CANCER TREATMENT ARE NEEDED. YOGA THERAPY HOLDS PROMISE AS AN INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE HRV AND PROS. THEREFORE, WE CONDUCTED A SINGLE-SUBJECT EXPLORATORY EXPERIMENTAL STUDY TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY ON HRV AND SPECIFIC PROS (IE, CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, ANXIETY, COGNITIVE FUNCTION, DEPRESSION, STRESS, QUALITY OF LIFE) IN ADULTS TREATED FOR CANCER. TO REDUCE PUBLICATION BIAS, IMPROVE REPRODUCIBILITY, AND SERVE AS A REFERENCE FOR FORTHCOMING REPORTING OF STUDY RESULTS, WE PRESENT THE STUDY PROTOCOL FOR THIS STUDY HEREIN. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE ADULTS WHO COMPLETED CANCER TREATMENT THAT WERE RECRUITED FROM THE OTTAWA INTEGRATIVE CANCER CENTRE. CONSENTING AND ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED ONE 1:1 YOGA THERAPY SESSION (IE, 1 PARTICIPANT, 1 YOGA THERAPIST) AND 6 WEEKLY GROUP-BASED YOGA THERAPY SESSIONS (IE, 2-3 PARTICIPANTS, 1 YOGA THERAPIST). PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED ASSESSMENTS 7 TIMES: 3 TIMES PRIOR TO THE PROGRAM (IE, -6 WEEKS, -3 WEEKS, IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE 1:1 YOGA THERAPY SESSION), IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE 1:1 YOGA THERAPY SESSION, PRIOR TO THE FIRST GROUP-BASED YOGA THERAPY SESSION, AFTER THE LAST GROUP-BASED YOGA THERAPY SESSION, AND AT A 6-WEEK FOLLOW-UP. HIERARCHICAL LINEAR MODELING WILL BE USED TO TEST THE AVERAGE EFFECTS OF THE YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM ACROSS PARTICIPANTS. DISCUSSION: THIS STUDY WILL EXPLORE SEVERAL NOVEL HYPOTHESES, INCLUDING WHETHER YOGA THERAPY CAN IMPROVE HRV AND/OR SPECIFIC PROS AMONG ADULTS TREATED FOR CANCER ACUTELY (IE, DURING A 1:1 YOGA THERAPY SESSION) AND/OR THROUGH REPEATED EXPOSURE (IE, AFTER COMPLETING 6 WEEKS OF GROUP-BASED YOGA THERAPY). ALTHOUGH THE FINDINGS WILL REQUIRE CONFIRMATION OR REFUTATION IN FUTURE TRIALS, THEY MAY PROVIDE INITIAL EVIDENCE THAT YT MAY BENEFIT ADULTS TREATED FOR CANCER.

17   91  38 A MULTICOMPONENT YOGA-BASED, BREATH INTERVENTION PROGRAM AS AN ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT IN PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER WITH OR WITHOUT COMORBIDITIES. OBJECTIVES: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY AND TOLERABILITY OF SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA (SKY) COURSE IN GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER (GAD) OUTPATIENTS, WHO AFTER EIGHT WEEKS OF AN APPROPRIATE DOSE OF TRADITIONAL THERAPY HAD NOT YET ACHIEVED REMISSION. SUBJECTS: THE ADULT PARTICIPANTS (18-65 YEARS) WERE OUTPATIENTS WITH A PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS OF GAD WITH OR WITHOUT COMORBIDITIES ON THE MINI-INTERNATIONAL NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INTERVIEW (MINI). PARTICIPANTS HAD A MINIMUM OF EIGHT WEEKS STANDARD TREATMENT WITH AN APPROPRIATE DOSE OF A STANDARD PRESCRIPTION ANXIOLYTIC, A CLINICIAN GLOBAL IMPRESSION-SEVERITY (CGI-S) SCORE OF 5-7, A HAMILTON ANXIETY SCALE (HAM-A) TOTAL SCORE >/=20 INCLUDING A SCORE OF >2 ON THE ANXIOUS MOOD AND TENSION ITEMS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FORTY-ONE PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED IN AN OPEN-LABEL TRIAL OF THE SKY COURSE AS AN ADJUNCT TO STANDARD TREATMENT OF GAD AT THE START CLINIC FOR MOOD AND ANXIETY DISORDERS, A TERTIARY CARE MOOD AND ANXIETY DISORDER CLINIC IN TORONTO. THE SKY COURSE WAS ADMINISTERED OVER FIVE DAYS (22 H TOTAL). SUBJECTS WERE ENCOURAGED TO PRACTICE THE YOGA BREATHING TECHNIQUES AT HOME FOR 20 MIN PER DAY AFTER THE COURSE AND WERE OFFERED GROUP PRACTICE SESSIONS FOR 2 H ONCE A WEEK LED BY CERTIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTORS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS THE MEAN CHANGE FROM PRE-TREATMENT ON THE HAM-A SCALE. PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASURES WERE OBTAINED AT BASELINE AND FOUR WEEKS AFTER COMPLETING THE INTERVENTION. RESULTS: THIRTY-ONE PATIENTS COMPLETED THE PROGRAM (MEAN AGE 42.6 +/- 13.3 YEARS). AMONG COMPLETERS, SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS OCCURRED IN THE PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION MEAN HAM-A TOTAL SCORE (T=4.59; P<0.01) AND PSYCHIC SUBSCALE (T=5.00; P</=0.01). THE RESPONSE RATE WAS 73% AND THE REMISSION RATE 41% AS MEASURED ON THE HAM-A. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS OF THIS SMALL PILOT TRIAL SUGGEST THAT THE SKY COURSE REPRESENTS A POTENTIALLY VALUABLE ADJUNCT TO STANDARD PHARMACOTHERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH GAD OR TREATMENT-RESISTANT GAD, AND WARRANTS FURTHER INVESTIGATION. IN PARTICULAR, CHANGES IN WORRY AND BODY SYMPTOMS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS THAT MAY FURTHER OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISM OF CHANGE IN THE TOLERANCE OF ANXIETY AND WORRY.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
18 2872  37 YOGA-ENHANCED COGNITIVE BEHAVIOURAL THERAPY (Y-CBT) FOR ANXIETY MANAGEMENT: A PILOT STUDY. COGNITIVE BEHAVIOURAL THERAPY (CBT) IS AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER, BUT THERE IS STILL ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT. THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE POTENTIAL BENEFIT OF ENRICHING CBT WITH KUNDALINI YOGA (Y-CBT). PARTICIPANTS CONSISTED OF TREATMENT RESISTANT CLIENTS AT A COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH CLINIC. A TOTAL OF 32 PARTICIPANTS ENROLLED IN THE STUDY AND 22 COMPLETED THE PROGRAMME. AFTER THE Y-CBT INTERVENTION, PRE-POST COMPARISONS SHOWED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN STATE AND TRAIT ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, PANIC, SLEEP AND QUALITY OF LIFE. RESULTS FROM THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY SUGGEST THAT Y-CBT MAY HAVE POTENTIAL AS A PROMISING TREATMENT FOR THOSE SUFFERING FROM GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER. KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGES: YOGA-ENHANCED COGNITIVE BEHAVIOURAL THERAPY (Y-CBT) MAY BE A PROMISING NEW TREATMENT FOR THOSE SUFFERING FROM GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER. Y-CBT MAY ALSO REDUCE DEPRESSION IN THOSE SUFFERING FROM GENERALIZED ANXIETY. Y-CBT MAY REDUCE DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY IN A CLINIC POPULATION WHERE CLIENTS SUFFER FROM MULTIPLE DIAGNOSES INCLUDING GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
19  173  38 A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY ON ASSESSMENT OF HEALTH STATUS, DEPRESSION, AND ANXIETY IN COAL MINERS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE FOLLOWING YOGA TRAINING. CONTEXT: PSYCHOLOGICAL COMORBIDITIES ARE PREVALENT IN COAL MINERS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD) AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE SEVERITY OF THE DISEASE REDUCING THEIR HEALTH STATUS. YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO ALLEVIATE DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY ASSOCIATED WITH OTHER CHRONIC DISEASES BUT IN COPD NOT BEEN FULLY INVESTIGATED. AIM: THIS STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE THE ROLE OF YOGA ON HEALTH STATUS, DEPRESSION, AND ANXIETY IN COAL MINERS WITH COPD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS WAS A RANDOMIZED TRIAL WITH TWO STUDY ARMS (YOGA AND CONTROL), WHICH ENROLLED 81 COAL MINERS, RANGING FROM 36 TO 60 YEARS WITH STAGE II AND III STABLE COPD. BOTH GROUPS WERE EITHER ON CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT OR COMBINATION OF CONVENTIONAL CARE WITH YOGA PROGRAM FOR 12 WEEKS. RESULTS: DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH STANDARDIZED QUESTIONNAIRES; COPD ASSESSMENT TEST, BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY AND STATE AND TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY AT THE BEGINNING AND THE END OF THE INTERVENTION. THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.001) IMPROVEMENTS ON ALL SCALES WITHIN THE GROUP, ALL SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT (P < 0.001) FROM CHANGES OBSERVED IN THE CONTROLS.

20  877  27 EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY ON SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY IN CANCER PATIENTS. BACKGROUND: MANY CANCER PATIENTS SUFFER FROM SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND FATIGUE. SUPPORTIVE TREATMENTS ARE INCREASINGLY USED TO ALLEVIATE DISTRESS IN CANCER. IN THIS STUDY, THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON THESE SYMPTOMS ARE EXAMINED. METHODS: WE PERFORMED A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY ON CANCER PATIENTS WITH MIXED DIAGNOSES COMPARING YOGA THERAPY WITH A WAITING LIST CONTROL GROUP. WE MEASURED ANXIETY SYMPTOMS WITH THE GENERAL ANXIETY DISORDER (GAD-7) SCALE, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS WITH THE PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE-2 (PHQ-2), AND FATIGUE WITH THE EUROPEAN ORGANISATION FOR RESEARCH AND TREATMENT OF CANCER FATIGUE SCALE (EORTC QLQ-FA13). YOGA THERAPY WAS CARRIED OUT IN WEEKLY SESSIONS OF 60 MIN EACH FOR 8 WEEKS. THE PROGRAM PROVIDED RESTRAINED BODY AND BREATHING EXERCISES AS WELL AS MEDITATION. THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT RECEIVE ANY YOGA THERAPY WHILE ON THE WAITING LIST. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 70 SUBJECTS PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY. ANXIETY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BY THE YOGA THERAPY IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP (P = 0.005). HOWEVER, YOGA THERAPY DID NOT SHOW ANY SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON DEPRESSION (P = 0.21) AND FATIGUE (P = 0.11) COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: YOGA THERAPY MAY BE USED TO ALLEVIATE ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IN CANCER PATIENTS AND SHOULD BE THE SUBJECT OF FURTHER RESEARCH.	2018

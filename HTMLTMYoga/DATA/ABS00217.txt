1  217 187 A STUDY PROTOCOL OF A THREE-GROUP RANDOMIZED FEASIBILITY TRIAL OF AN ONLINE YOGA INTERVENTION FOR MOTHERS AFTER STILLBIRTH (THE MINDFUL HEALTH STUDY). BACKGROUND: IN THE USA, STILLBIRTH (IN UTERO FETAL DEATH >/=20 WEEKS GESTATION) IS A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE. WOMEN WHO EXPERIENCE STILLBIRTH, COMPARED TO WOMEN WITH LIVE BIRTH, HAVE A NEARLY SEVENFOLD INCREASED RISK OF A POSITIVE SCREEN FOR POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) AND A FOURFOLD INCREASED RISK OF DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF WOMEN WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THE DEATH OF THEIR BABY BECOME PREGNANT WITHIN 12-18 MONTHS AND THE LACK OF INTERVENTION STUDIES CONDUCTED WITHIN THIS POPULATION, NOVEL APPROACHES TARGETING PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH, SPECIFIC TO THE NEEDS OF THIS POPULATION, ARE CRITICAL. EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT YOGA IS EFFICACIOUS, SAFE, ACCEPTABLE, AND COST-EFFECTIVE FOR IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH IN A VARIETY OF POPULATIONS, INCLUDING PREGNANT AND POSTPARTUM WOMEN. TO DATE, THERE ARE NO KNOWN STUDIES EXAMINING ONLINE-STREAMING YOGA AS A STRATEGY TO HELP MOTHERS COPE WITH PTSD SYMPTOMS AFTER STILLBIRTH. METHODS: THE PRESENT STUDY IS A TWO-PHASE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. PHASE 1 WILL INVOLVE (1) AN ITERATIVE DESIGN PROCESS TO DEVELOP THE ONLINE YOGA PRESCRIPTION FOR PHASE 2 AND (2) QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS TO IDENTIFY CULTURAL BARRIERS TO RECRUITMENT IN NON-CAUCASIAN WOMEN (I.E., PREDOMINATELY HISPANIC AND/OR AFRICAN AMERICAN) WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED STILLBIRTH (N = 5). PHASE 2 IS A THREE-GROUP RANDOMIZED FEASIBILITY TRIAL WITH ASSESSMENTS AT BASELINE, AND AT 12 AND 20 WEEKS POST-INTERVENTION. NINETY WOMEN WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED A STILLBIRTH WITHIN 6 WEEKS TO 24 MONTHS WILL BE RANDOMIZED INTO ONE OF THE FOLLOWING THREE ARMS FOR 12 WEEKS: (1) INTERVENTION LOW DOSE (LD) = 60 MIN/WEEK ONLINE-STREAMING YOGA (N = 30), (2) INTERVENTION MODERATE DOSE (MD) = 150 MIN/WEEK ONLINE-STREAMING YOGA (N = 30), OR (3) STRETCH AND TONE CONTROL (STC) GROUP = 60 MIN/WEEK OF STRETCHING/TONING EXERCISES (N = 30). DISCUSSION: THIS STUDY WILL EXPLORE THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF A 12-WEEK, HOME-BASED, ONLINE-STREAMED YOGA INTERVENTION, WITH VARYING DOSES AMONG MOTHERS AFTER A STILLBIRTH. IF FEASIBLE, THE FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY WILL INFORM A FULL-SCALE TRIAL TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HOME-BASED ONLINE-STREAMED YOGA TO IMPROVE PTSD. LONG-TERM, HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS COULD USE ONLINE YOGA AS A NON-PHARMACEUTICAL, INEXPENSIVE RESOURCE FOR STILLBIRTH AFTERCARE.

2 1683  70 ONLINE YOGA TO REDUCE POST TRAUMATIC STRESS IN WOMEN WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED STILLBIRTH: A RANDOMIZED CONTROL FEASIBILITY TRIAL. BACKGROUND: ABOUT 1 IN EVERY 150 PREGNANCIES END IN STILLBIRTH. CONSEQUENCES INCLUDE SYMPTOMS OF POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD), DEPRESSION, AND ANXIETY. YOGA HAS BEEN USED TO TREAT PTSD IN OTHER POPULATIONS AND MAY IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR STILLBIRTH MOTHERS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE: (A) FEASIBILITY OF A 12-WEEK HOME-BASED, ONLINE YOGA INTERVENTION WITH VARYING DOSES; (B) ACCEPTABILITY OF A "STRETCH AND TONE" CONTROL GROUP; AND (C) PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF THE INTERVENTION ON REDUCING SYMPTOMS OF PTSD, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, PERINATAL GRIEF, SELF-COMPASSION, EMOTIONAL REGULATION, MINDFULNESS, SLEEP QUALITY, AND SUBJECTIVE HEALTH. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS (N = 90) WERE RECRUITED NATIONALLY AND RANDOMIZED INTO ONE OF THREE GROUPS FOR YOGA OR EXERCISE (LOW DOSE (LD), 60 MIN PER WEEK; MODERATE DOSE (MD), 150 MIN PER WEEK; AND STRETCH-AND-TONE CONTROL GROUP (STC)). BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION SURVEYS MEASURED MAIN OUTCOMES (LISTED ABOVE). FREQUENCY ANALYSES WERE USED TO DETERMINE FEASIBILITY. REPEATED MEASURES ANCOVA WERE USED TO DETERMINE PRELIMINARY EFFICACY. MULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSES WERE USED TO DETERMINE A DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MINUTES OF YOGA AND EACH OUTCOME VARIABLE. RESULTS: OVER HALF OF PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE INTERVENTION (N = 48/90). BENCHMARKS (>/=70% REPORTED > 75% SATISFACTION) WERE MET IN EACH GROUP FOR SATISFACTION AND ENJOYMENT. PARTICIPANTS MEETING BENCHMARKS (COMPLETING > 90% OF PRESCRIBED MINUTES 9/12 WEEKS) FOR LD AND MD GROUPS WERE 44% (N = 8/18) AND 6% (N = 1/16), RESPECTIVELY. LD AND MD GROUPS AVERAGED 44.0 AND 77.3 MIN PER WEEK OF YOGA, RESPECTIVELY. THE MD GROUP REPORTED THAT 150 PRESCRIBED MINUTES PER WEEK OF YOGA WAS TOO MUCH. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN PTSD AND DEPRESSION, AND IMPROVEMENTS IN SELF-RATED HEALTH AT POST-INTERVENTION FOR BOTH INTERVENTION GROUPS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN DEPRESSION SCORES (P = .036) AND GRIEF INTENSITY (P = .009) BETWEEN THE MD AND STC GROUPS. PTSD SHOWED NON-SIGNIFICANT DECREASES OF 43% AND 56% AT POST-INTERVENTION IN LD AND MD GROUPS, RESPECTIVELY (22% DECREASE IN CONTROL). CONCLUSIONS: THIS WAS THE FIRST STUDY TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF AN ONLINE YOGA INTERVENTION FOR WOMEN AFTER STILLBIRTH.

3 1243  63 FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA, AEROBIC AND STRETCHING-TONING EXERCISE PROGRAM FOR ADULT CANCER SURVIVORS: THE STAYFIT TRIAL. BACKGROUND: THE USE OF YOGA AS A MIND-BODY PRACTICE HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY POPULAR AMONG CLINICAL POPULATIONS AND OLDER ADULTS WHO USE THIS PRACTICE TO MANAGE AGE AND CHRONIC DISEASE-RELATED SYMPTOMS. ALTHOUGH YOGA CONTINUES TO GAIN POPULARITY AMONG PRACTITIONERS AND RESEARCHERS, PILOT STUDIES THAT EXAMINE ITS FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY, ESPECIALLY AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS, ARE LIMITED. FEASIBILITY STUDIES PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN DETERMINING WHETHER THE TARGET POPULATION IS LIKELY TO ENGAGE WITH LARGER SCALE EFFICACY AND EFFECTIVENESS TRIALS. IN THIS PAPER WE PRESENT FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY DATA FROM A 12-WEEK RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) CONDUCTED WITH ADULT CANCER SURVIVORS. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS N = 78 (MEAN AGE: 55 YEARS) WERE RANDOMIZED TO ONE OF THREE GROUPS: A HATHA YOGA, AEROBIC EXERCISE, OR STRETCHING-TONING CONTROL GROUP WITH GROUP EXERCISE CLASSES HELD FOR 150 MIN/WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS. HEREIN WE REPORT FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY, INCLUDING ENROLLMENT RATES, ATTENDANCE, ATTRITION AND ADVERSE EVENTS, AND PARTICIPANT FEEDBACK AND SATISFACTION DATA. RESULTS: OF THE 233 ADULTS SCREENED, 109 WERE ELIGIBLE AND 78 RANDOMIZED TO ONE OF THE THREE INTERVENTION ARMS. SESSION ATTENDANCE WAS HIGH FOR ALL GROUPS (75.5-89.5%) AND 17 PARTICIPANTS DROPPED OUT DURING THE 12-WEEK INTERVENTION. PROGRAM SATISFACTION WAS HIGH (4.8 OR HIGHER OUT OF 5) AND NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. ONE COHORT (N = 15) OF THE INTERVENTION TRANSITIONED TO REMOTE INTERVENTION DELIVERY DUE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. FEASIBILITY DATA FROM THESE PARTICIPANTS SUGGESTED THAT SYNCHRONIZED GROUP EXERCISE CLASSES VIA ZOOM WITH A LIVE INSTRUCTOR WERE ACCEPTABLE AND ENJOYABLE. PARTICIPANT FEEDBACK REGARDING MOST AND LEAST HELPFUL ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM AS WELL AS SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE YOGA INTERVENTIONS ARE SUMMARIZED. CONCLUSIONS: OVERALL, THE YOGA INTERVENTION WAS HIGHLY FEASIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE. THE FEASIBILITY PARAMETERS FROM THIS TRIAL CAN AID RESEARCHERS IN ESTIMATING RECRUITMENT RATES FOR DESIRED SAMPLE SIZES TO SUCCESSFULLY RANDOMIZE AND RETAIN CANCER SURVIVORS IN SHORT- AND LONG-TERM YOGA-BASED EFFICACY AND EFFECTIVENESS TRIALS. THE FINDINGS ALSO PROVIDE EVIDENCE TO CLINICIANS WHO CAN RECOMMEND UP TO 150 MIN OF A COMBINATION OF EXERCISES-AEROBIC, YOGA, OR STRETCHING-TONING TO THEIR CANCER PATIENTS IN ORDER TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND WELLBEING DURING CANCER SURVIVORSHIP.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
4 1769  39 POTENTIAL FOR PRENATAL YOGA TO SERVE AS AN INTERVENTION TO TREAT DEPRESSION DURING PREGNANCY. BACKGROUND: WHEN LEFT UNTREATED, ANTENATAL DEPRESSION CAN HAVE A SERIOUS NEGATIVE IMPACT ON MATERNAL, AND INFANT OUTCOMES. MANY AFFECTED WOMEN DO NOT OBTAIN TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION OWING TO DIFFICULTIES ACCESSING CARE OR BECAUSE THEY DO NOT FIND STANDARD ANTIDEPRESSANT TREATMENTS TO BE ACCEPTABLE DURING PREGNANCY. THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF A GENTLE PRENATAL YOGA INTERVENTION, AS A STRATEGY FOR TREATING DEPRESSION DURING PREGNANCY. METHODS: WE DEVELOPED A 10-WEEK PRENATAL YOGA PROGRAM FOR ANTENATAL DEPRESSION AND AN ACCOMPANYING YOGA INSTRUCTORS' MANUAL, AND ENROLLED 34 DEPRESSED PREGNANT WOMEN FROM THE COMMUNITY INTO AN OPEN PILOT TRIAL. WE MEASURED CHANGE IN MATERNAL DEPRESSION SEVERITY FROM BEFORE TO AFTER THE INTERVENTION. RESULTS: RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT THE PRENATAL YOGA INTERVENTION WAS FEASIBLE TO ADMINISTER AND ACCEPTABLE TO THE WOMEN ENROLLED. NO STUDY-RELATED INJURIES OR OTHER SAFETY ISSUES WERE OBSERVED DURING THE TRIAL. ON AVERAGE, PARTICIPANTS' DEPRESSION SEVERITY DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY BY THE END OF THE INTERVENTION BASED ON BOTH OBSERVED-RATED AND SELF-REPORT DEPRESSION ASSESSMENT MEASURES. CONCLUSION: THE CURRENT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT PRENATAL YOGA MAY BE A VIABLE APPROACH TO ADDRESSING ANTENATAL DEPRESSION, ONE THAT MAY HAVE ADVANTAGES IN TERMS OF GREATER ACCEPTABILITY THAN STANDARD DEPRESSION TREATMENTS. RESEARCH AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
5 1242  45 FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA INTERVENTION TO DECREASE PAIN IN OLDER WOMEN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF OLDER WOMEN SUFFER FROM CHRONIC PAIN, WHICH CAN DECREASE QUALITY OF LIFE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PILOT RANDOMIZED STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF A FLOW-RESTORATIVE YOGA INTERVENTION DESIGNED TO DECREASE PAIN AND RELATED OUTCOMES AMONG WOMEN AGED 60 OR OLDER. METHODS: FLOW-RESTORATIVE YOGA CLASSES WERE HELD TWICE WEEKLY FOR 1 HOUR AND LED BY A CERTIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTOR. PARTICIPANTS RANDOMIZED TO THE INTERVENTION GROUP ATTENDED THE YOGA CLASSES FOR 12 WEEKS AND RECEIVED SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS FOR AT-HOME PRACTICE. THOSE RANDOMIZED TO THE CONTROL GROUP WERE ASKED TO MAINTAIN THEIR NORMAL DAILY ROUTINE. FEASIBILITY WAS EVALUATED USING RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION RATES, CLASS AND HOME PRACTICE ADHERENCE RATES, AND PARTICIPANT SATISFACTION SURVEYS. OUTCOME MEASURES (SELF-REPORTED PAIN, INFLAMMATORY MARKERS, FUNCTIONAL FITNESS, QUALITY OF LIFE, RESILIENCE, AND SELF-REPORTED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY) WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION. PAIRED T-TESTS OR WILCOXON SIGNED-RANK TESTS WERE USED TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN OUTCOME MEASURES WITHIN TREATMENT GROUPS. RESULTS: THIRTY-EIGHT PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED. PARTICIPANTS WERE PRIMARILY WHITE, COLLEGE-EDUCATED, AND HIGHER FUNCTIONING, DESPITE EXPERIENCING VARIOUS FORMS OF CHRONIC PAIN. ATTENDANCE AND RETENTION RATES WERE HIGH (91 AND 97%, RESPECTIVELY) AND THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS WERE SATISFIED WITH THE YOGA PROGRAM (89%) AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS (87%). INTERVENTION PARTICIPANTS ALSO EXPERIENCED REDUCTIONS IN PAIN INTERFERENCE AND IMPROVEMENTS IN ENERGY AND SOCIAL FUNCTIONING. CONCLUSIONS: THIS PILOT STUDY PROVIDES ESSENTIAL DATA TO INFORM A FULL SCALE RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF FLOW-RESTORATIVE YOGA FOR OLDER WOMEN WITH CHRONIC PAIN.

6 2385  45 YOGA ADHERENCE IN OLDER WOMEN SIX MONTHS POST-OSTEOARTHRITIS INTERVENTION. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) IS A HIGHLY PREVALENT CONDITION WORLDWIDE. YOGA IS POTENTIALLY A SAFE AND FEASIBLE OPTION FOR MANAGING OA; HOWEVER, THE EXTENT OF LONG-TERM YOGA ADHERENCE IS UNKNOWN. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE YOGA ADHERENCE 6 MONTHS AFTER PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED AN OA INTERVENTION PROGRAM. METHODS: THIS FOLLOW-UP STUDY EMPLOYED A CROSS-SECTIONAL DESCRIPTIVE DESIGN USING SURVEY, INTERVIEW, AND VIDEO RECORDINGS TO COLLECT BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA. A TOTAL OF 31 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED AND RETURNED THE SURVEY, AND 10 VIDEOTAPED THEIR YOGA PRACTICE FOR 1 WEEK AND PARTICIPATED IN A FACE-TO-FACE INTERVIEW. RESULTS: A MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS (N=19, 61%) REPORTED THAT THEY WERE STILL PRACTICING YOGA 6 MONTHS AFTER THE INTERVENTION PROGRAM. ON AVERAGE, PARTICIPANTS REPORTED PRACTICING 21 TO 30 MINUTES OF YOGA PER DAY (32%) 3 TO 4 DAYS PER WEEK (47%). "FEELING GOOD OR FEELING BETTER AFTER YOGA PRACTICE" (50%) AND "SET ASIDE A TIME" (31%) WERE THE MOST COMMON MOTIVATING FACTORS FOR YOGA ADHERENCE. DEALING WITH HEALTH PROBLEMS (42%), HAVING PAIN (25%), AND BEING TOO BUSY (25%) WERE THE MAJOR BARRIERS. QUALITATIVE DATA REVEALED THAT PARTICIPANTS: (1) USED MINDFUL YOGA MOVEMENT, (2) INCORPORATED OTHER FORMS OF EXERCISE AND RESOURCES DURING YOGA PRACTICE, AND (3) CREATED PERSONALIZED YOGA PROGRAMS. ADDITIONALLY, THE PARTICIPANTS REPORTED LESS OA PAIN, INCREASED PHYSICAL ENDURANCE, AND MORE RELAXATION. CONCLUSION: MANY PARTICIPANTS ADHERED TO YOGA PRACTICE 6 MONTHS POST-INTERVENTION ALTHOUGH NOT AT THE FREQUENCY AND SEQUENCE AS PRESCRIBED. FEELING BETTER AFTER PRACTICE MOTIVATED PARTICIPANTS, BUT OTHER FACTORS REMAINED KEY BARRIERS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
7  106  29 A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING PRENATAL YOGA TO PERINATAL HEALTH EDUCATION FOR ANTENATAL DEPRESSION. WE CONDUCTED A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) COMPARING A PRENATAL YOGA INTERVENTION TO PERINATAL-FOCUSED HEALTH EDUCATION IN PREGNANT WOMEN WITH DEPRESSION. FINDINGS DOCUMENT ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF THE YOGA INTERVENTION: NO YOGA-RELATED INJURIES WERE OBSERVED, INSTRUCTORS SHOWED FIDELITY TO THE YOGA MANUAL, AND WOMEN RATED INTERVENTIONS AS ACCEPTABLE. ALTHOUGH IMPROVEMENTS IN DEPRESSION WERE NOT STATISTICALLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN GROUPS, THEY FAVORED YOGA. THIS STUDY PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR A LARGER SCALE RCT EXAMINING PRENATAL YOGA TO IMPROVE MOOD DURING PREGNANCY.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
8 1617  55 MINDFUL YOGA FOR WOMEN WITH METASTATIC BREAST CANCER: DESIGN OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: WOMEN WITH METASTATIC BREAST CANCER (MBC) HAVE AVERAGE LIFE EXPECTANCIES OF ABOUT 2 YEARS, AND REPORT HIGH LEVELS OF DISEASE-RELATED SYMPTOMS INCLUDING PAIN, FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, AND FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT. THERE IS GROWING RECOGNITION OF THE LIMITATIONS OF MEDICAL APPROACHES TO MANAGING SUCH SYMPTOMS. YOGA IS A MIND-BODY DISCIPLINE THAT HAS DEMONSTRATED A POSITIVE IMPACT ON PSYCHOLOGICAL AND FUNCTIONAL HEALTH IN EARLY STAGE BREAST CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS, BUT HAS NOT BEEN RIGOROUSLY STUDIED IN ADVANCED CANCER SAMPLES. METHODS: THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL EXAMINES THE FEASIBILITY AND INITIAL EFFICACY OF A MINDFUL YOGA PROGRAM, COMPARED WITH A SOCIAL SUPPORT CONDITION THAT CONTROLS FOR ATTENTION, ON MEASURES OF DISEASE-RELATED SYMPTOMS SUCH AS PAIN AND FATIGUE. THE STUDY WILL BE COMPLETED BY DECEMBER 2017. SIXTY-FIVE WOMEN WITH MBC AGE >/= 18 ARE BEING IDENTIFIED AND RANDOMIZED WITH A 2:1 ALLOCATION TO MINDFUL YOGA OR A SUPPORT GROUP CONTROL INTERVENTION. THE 120-MIN INTERVENTION SESSIONS TAKE PLACE WEEKLY FOR 8 WEEKS. THE STUDY IS CONDUCTED AT AN URBAN TERTIARY CARE ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER LOCATED IN DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA. THE PRIMARY FEASIBILITY OUTCOME IS ATTENDANCE AT INTERVENTION SESSIONS. EFFICACY OUTCOMES INCLUDE PAIN, FATIGUE, SLEEP QUALITY, PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, MINDFULNESS AND FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY AT POST-INTERVENTION, 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP, AND 6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. DISCUSSION: IN THIS ARTICLE, WE PRESENT THE CHALLENGES OF DESIGNING A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP AMONG WOMEN WITH MBC. THESE CHALLENGES INCLUDE ENSURING ADEQUATE RECRUITMENT INCLUDING OF MINORITIES, LIMITING AND CONTROLLING FOR SELECTION BIAS, TAILORING OF THE YOGA INTERVENTION TO ADDRESS SPECIAL NEEDS, AND MAXIMIZING ADHERENCE AND RETENTION. THIS PROJECT WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR WOMEN WITH ADVANCED CANCER, INCLUDING PRELIMINARY DATA ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND FUNCTIONAL EFFECTS OF YOGA FOR MBC PATIENTS. THIS INVESTIGATION WILL ALSO ESTABLISH RIGOROUS METHODS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH INTO YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR THIS POPULATION.

BACKGROUND: HIGH RATES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL-DISTRESS, TRAUMA AND SOCIAL COMPLEXITY ARE REPORTED AMONG YOUNG PREGNANT WOMEN. AT THE ROYAL WOMEN'S HOSPITAL, AUSTRALIA, YOUNG PREGNANT WOMEN ACKNOWLEDGE WANTING TOOLS TO IMPROVE MATERNAL WELLBEING YET REMAIN CHALLENGING TO ENGAGE IN ANTENATAL EDUCATION AND SUPPORT. WHILE YOGA IS A WIDELY ACCEPTED AND PARTICIPATED ACTIVITY IN PREGNANCY, WITH DEMONSTRATED BENEFITS FOR ADULT PREGNANT WOMEN, ADOLESCENT WOMEN ARE OFTEN EXCLUDED FROM BOTH THESE YOGA INTERVENTIONS AND RELATED PREGNANCY STUDIES. METHODS: THIS MIXED METHODS STUDY EXAMINED THE ACCEPTABILITY AND BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR YOUNG WOMEN. WE RECRUITED 30 PARTICIPANTS AGED UNDER 24 YEARS, WHO WERE OFFERED TWICE A WEEK, ONE-HOUR VOLUNTARY PRENATAL YOGA SESSIONS THROUGHOUT THEIR PREGNANCY. A MEDICAL FILE AUDIT GATHERED BASELINE DEMOGRAPHICS, PRE AND POST YOGA SESSION SURVEYS WERE ADMINISTERED AND BRIEF INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEW WERE CONDUCTED WITH STUDY PARTICIPANTS. RESULTS: WHILE 26 STUDY PARTICIPANTS WERE POSITIVE ABOUT THE AVAILABILITY OF A YOGA PROGRAM, ONLY 15 COULD ATTEND YOGA SESSIONS (MEAN = 8 SESSIONS, RANGE 1-27). NO DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND IN THE DEMOGRAPHIC OR PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS BETWEEN THOSE WHO DID AND DID NOT ATTEND THE YOGA SESSIONS. THE MEDICAL FILE AUDIT FOUND THAT 60% OF ALL THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS HAD A DOCUMENTED HISTORY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATION WERE PRAGMATIC, NOT ATTITUDINAL, BASED ON THE TIMING OF THE GROUP SESSIONS, TRANSPORT AVAILABILITY AND THEIR OWN HEALTH. ALL STUDY PARTICIPANTS IDENTIFIED PERCEIVED BENEFITS, AND THE YOGA PARTICIPANTS IDENTIFIED THESE AS IMPROVED RELAXATION AND REDUCTION OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS; LABOUR PREPARATION; BONDING WITH THEIR BABY IN UTERO; AND SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS WITH THE YOGA GROUP PEERS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATED YOGA WAS ACCEPTABLE TO YOUNG PREGNANT WOMEN. FOR THOSE WHO DID PARTICIPATE IN THE SESSIONS, YOGA WAS FOUND TO DECREASE SELF-REPORTED DISTRESS AND INCREASE PERCEIVED SKILLS TO ASSIST WITH THEIR LABOUR AND THE BIRTH OF THEIR BABY. THE PROVISION OF ACCESSIBLE YOGA PROGRAMS FOR PREGNANT YOUNG WOMEN IS RECOMMENDED.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
10  345  33 ASSESSING FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF YOGA AND GROUP CBT FOR ADOLESCENTS WITH DEPRESSION: A PILOT RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. PURPOSE: GIVEN INCREASING RATES OF DEPRESSION IN ADOLESCENTS, THERE IS A CLEAR NEED FOR INNOVATIVE TREATMENTS. IN THIS PILOT RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL, WE ASSESSED ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF TWO GROUP-BASED INTERVENTIONS: YOGA AND COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT). THE GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO PREPARE FOR A FUTURE FULLY POWERED RANDOMIZED TRIAL TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT YOGA IS NOT INFERIOR TO AN ESTABLISHED ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION TREATMENT, NAMELY, GROUP CBT. METHODS: WE ENROLLED 42 ADOLESCENTS WITH ELEVATED DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A 12-WEEK GROUP-BASED INTERVENTION, YOGA OR CBT. WE HAD A PRIORI FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY TARGETS, INCLUDING FOR RECRUITMENT RATE, RETENTION RATE, EXPECTANCY, CREDIBILITY, PROGRAM SATISFACTION, CLASS ATTENDANCE, ENGAGEMENT IN HOME PRACTICE, AND INSTRUCTOR/LEADER MANUAL ADHERENCE. WE ASSESSED ADVERSE EVENTS, AND WITHIN-SUBJECT CHANGES IN OUTCOMES (DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, IMPAIRMENT, SLEEP DISTURBANCE) AND POSSIBLE MEDIATORS (MINDFULNESS, SELF-COMPASSION). RESULTS: BOTH INTERVENTIONS MET MOST ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY TARGETS. THE ONLY TARGET NOT MET RELATED TO LOW ENGAGEMENT IN HOME PRACTICE. PARTICIPANTS WITHIN EACH STUDY ARM SHOWED DECREASED DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS OVER TIME AND INCREASED SELF-COMPASSION. CONCLUSIONS: A YOGA INTERVENTION APPEARS TO BE ACCEPTABLE AND FEASIBLE TO ADOLESCENTS WITH DEPRESSION. HOWEVER, IT MAY BE CHALLENGING FOR THIS GROUP TO ENGAGE IN UNSTRUCTURED HOME PRACTICE.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
11 1240  40 FEASIBILITY OF A MINDFUL YOGA PROGRAM FOR WOMEN WITH METASTATIC BREAST CANCER: RESULTS OF A RANDOMIZED PILOT STUDY. PURPOSE: PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC BREAST CANCER (MBC) EXPERIENCE HIGH LEVELS OF SYMPTOMS. YOGA INTERVENTIONS HAVE SHOWN PROMISE FOR IMPROVING CANCER SYMPTOMS BUT HAVE RARELY BEEN TESTED IN PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED DISEASE. THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE ACCEPTABILITY OF A COMPREHENSIVE YOGA PROGRAM FOR MBC AND THE FEASIBILITY OF CONDUCTING A RANDOMIZED TRIAL TESTING THE INTERVENTION. METHODS: SIXTY-THREE WOMEN WITH MBC WERE RANDOMIZED WITH A 2:1 ALLOCATION TO YOGA OR A SUPPORT GROUP COMPARISON CONDITION. BOTH INTERVENTIONS INVOLVED EIGHT WEEKLY GROUP SESSIONS. FEASIBILITY WAS QUANTIFIED USING RATES OF ACCRUAL, ATTRITION, AND SESSION ATTENDANCE. ACCEPTABILITY WAS ASSESSED WITH A STANDARDIZED SELF-REPORT MEASURE. PAIN, FATIGUE, SLEEP QUALITY, PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, MINDFULNESS, AND FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE, POST-INTERVENTION, AND 3 AND 6 MONTHS POST-INTERVENTION. RESULTS: WE MET GOALS FOR ACCRUAL AND RETENTION, WITH 50% OF ELIGIBLE PATIENTS ENROLLED AND 87% OF RANDOMIZED PARTICIPANTS COMPLETING POST-INTERVENTION SURVEYS. SIXTY-FIVE PERCENT OF WOMEN IN THE YOGA CONDITION AND 90% IN THE SUPPORT GROUP ATTENDED >/= 4 SESSIONS. EIGHTY PERCENT OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA CONDITION AND 65% IN THE SUPPORT GROUP INDICATED THAT THEY WERE HIGHLY SATISFIED WITH THE INTERVENTION. FOLLOWING TREATMENT, WOMEN IN THE YOGA INTERVENTION HAD MODEST IMPROVEMENTS IN SOME OUTCOMES; HOWEVER, OVERALL SYMPTOM LEVELS WERE LOW FOR WOMEN IN BOTH CONDITIONS. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE YOGA INTERVENTION CONTENT WAS HIGHLY ACCEPTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH MBC, BUT THAT THERE ARE CHALLENGES TO IMPLEMENTING AN INTERVENTION INVOLVING EIGHT GROUP-BASED IN-PERSON SESSIONS. ALTERNATIVE MODES OF DELIVERY MAY BE NECESSARY TO REACH PATIENTS MOST IN NEED OF INTERVENTION.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
12 2538  47 YOGA FOR ADULT WOMEN WITH CHRONIC PTSD: A LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP STUDY. INTRODUCTION: YOGA-THE INTEGRATIVE PRACTICE OF PHYSICAL POSTURES AND MOVEMENT, BREATH EXERCISES, AND MINDFULNESS-MAY SERVE AS A USEFUL ADJUNCTIVE COMPONENT OF TRAUMA-FOCUSED TREATMENT TO BUILD SKILLS IN TOLERATING AND MODULATING PHYSIOLOGIC AND AFFECTIVE STATES THAT HAVE BECOME DYSREGULATED BY TRAUMA EXPOSURE. A PREVIOUS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT AMONG 60 WOMEN WITH CHRONIC, TREATMENT-RESISTANT POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) AND ASSOCIATED MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS STEMMING FROM PROLONGED OR MULTIPLE TRAUMA EXPOSURES. AFTER 10 SESSIONS OF YOGA, PARTICIPANTS EXHIBITED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN PTSD SYMPTOM SEVERITY AND GREATER LIKELIHOOD OF LOSS OF PTSD DIAGNOSIS, SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN ENGAGEMENT IN NEGATIVE TENSION REDUCTION ACTIVITIES (E.G., SELF-INJURY), AND GREATER REDUCTIONS IN DISSOCIATIVE AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS WHEN COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL (A SEMINAR IN WOMEN'S HEALTH). THE CURRENT STUDY IS A LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENT OF PARTICIPANTS WHO COMPLETED THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS FROM THE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WERE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENTS APPROXIMATELY 1.5 YEARS AFTER STUDY COMPLETION TO ASSESS WHETHER THE INITIAL INTERVENTION AND/OR YOGA PRACTICE AFTER TREATMENT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH ADDITIONAL CHANGES. FORTY-NINE WOMEN COMPLETED THE LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP INTERVIEWS. HIERARCHICAL REGRESSION ANALYSIS WAS USED TO EXAMINE WHETHER TREATMENT GROUP STATUS IN THE ORIGINAL STUDY AND FREQUENCY OF YOGA PRACTICE AFTER THE STUDY PREDICTED GREATER CHANGES IN SYMPTOMS AND PTSD DIAGNOSIS. RESULTS: GROUP ASSIGNMENT IN THE ORIGINAL RANDOMIZED STUDY WAS NOT A SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR OF LONGER-TERM OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, FREQUENCY OF CONTINUING YOGA PRACTICE SIGNIFICANTLY PREDICTED GREATER DECREASES IN PTSD SYMPTOM SEVERITY AND DEPRESSION SYMPTOM SEVERITY, AS WELL AS A GREATER LIKELIHOOD OF A LOSS OF PTSD DIAGNOSIS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA APPEARS TO BE A USEFUL TREATMENT MODALITY; THE GREATEST LONG-TERM BENEFITS ARE DERIVED FROM MORE FREQUENT YOGA PRACTICE.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
13 1165  61 EVALUATING THE FEASIBILITY AND IMPACT OF A YOGA INTERVENTION ON COGNITION, PHYSICAL FUNCTION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND AFFECTIVE OUTCOMES IN PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV: PROTOCOL FOR A RANDOMIZED PILOT TRIAL. BACKGROUND: DESPITE LOWER MORTALITY RATES DUE TO COMBINATION ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY, PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV (PLWH) ARE GRAPPLING WITH INCREASINGLY COMPLEX HEALTH ISSUES, INCLUDING COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS IN AREAS SUCH AS MEMORY, ATTENTION, PROCESSING SPEED, AND MOTOR FUNCTION. YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE AN EFFECTIVE FORM OF EXERCISE AND MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION FOR MANY CLINICAL POPULATIONS. HOWEVER, NO RANDOMIZED TRIALS HAVE EVALUATED THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION AMONG PLWH. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS PILOT RANDOMIZED TRIAL WAS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA INTERVENTION TO LAY THE GROUNDWORK FOR A FULL-SCALE, MULTISITE, COMMUNITY-BASED TRIAL FOR PLWH. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES ARE TO (1) ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF STUDY PROTOCOL AND PROCEDURES, (2) COMPARE COGNITION IN THE YOGA GROUP WITH THE USUAL CARE CONTROL GROUP AFTER 12 WEEKS OF THE INTERVENTION IN PLWH, AND (3) COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF THE 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION VERSUS CONTROL ON BALANCE, WALKING SPEED, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, MENTAL HEALTH, MEDICATION ADHERENCE, AND QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG PLWH. METHODS: WE PROPOSE A PILOT RANDOMIZED TRIAL WITH 2 PARALLEL GROUPS (YOGA VERSUS CONTROL). WE WILL RECRUIT 25 PLWH (>35 YEARS) FROM COMMUNITY AND HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS IN HALIFAX, CANADA. AFTER BASELINE ASSESSMENT WITH BLINDED ASSESSORS, PARTICIPANTS WILL BE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO THE YOGA OR CONTROL GROUP, USING A RANDOM COMPUTER GENERATOR. PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP WILL ENGAGE IN SUPERVISED 60-MIN GROUP-BASED YOGA SESSIONS 3 TIMES A WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS AT A YOGA STUDIO. PARTICIPANTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP WILL MAINTAIN THEIR CURRENT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY LEVELS THROUGHOUT THE STUDY. RESULTS: AS PER THE CONSOLIDATED STANDARDS OF REPORTING TRIALS EXTENSION FOR PILOT STUDIES, MEANS OF ALL OUTCOMES, MEAN CHANGE, AND 95% CIS WILL BE CALCULATED FOR EACH GROUP SEPARATELY. TWO-TAILED INDEPENDENT T TESTS AND FISHER EXACT TESTS WILL BE USED TO COMPARE GROUPS AT BASELINE. WE WILL ANALYZE QUANTITATIVE POSTINTERVENTION QUESTIONNAIRE RESPONSES USING CHI-SQUARE TESTS, AND OPEN-ENDED RESPONSES WILL BE ANALYZED THEMATICALLY. INTENTION-TO-TREAT AND PER-PROTOCOL ANALYSES WILL BE USED TO ANALYZE SECONDARY VARIABLES. CHANGES IN OUTCOME VARIABLES WILL BE EXAMINED BETWEEN GROUPS AND WITHIN GROUPS. EFFECT SIZES WILL BE REPORTED FOR EACH OUTCOME. A PRIORI ADHERENCE AND SATISFACTION CRITERIA WILL BE MET IF PARTICIPANTS ATTEND >70% OF THE YOGA SESSIONS AND IF >70% OF THE PARTICIPANTS ARE SATISFIED WITH THE INTERVENTION AS DETERMINED BY A POSTPARTICIPATION QUESTIONNAIRE. STUDY ENROLLMENT BEGAN IN JANUARY 2018, WITH RESULTS EXPECTED FOR OCTOBER 2019. CONCLUSIONS: THIS PILOT RANDOMIZED TRIAL WILL BE THE FIRST TO INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFECT OF A YOGA INTERVENTION ON COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL OUTCOMES AMONG PLWH. THIS WORK WILL INFORM THE FEASIBILITY OF FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS IN TERMS OF CAPACITY BUILDING, PARTICIPANT RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION, AND ASSESSMENT AND INTERVENTION PROTOCOLS.

14  282  38 ADHERENCE TO YOGA AND EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS IN A 6-MONTH CLINICAL TRIAL. BACKGROUND: TO DETERMINE FACTORS THAT PREDICT ADHERENCE TO A MIND-BODY INTERVENTION IN A RANDOMIZED TRIAL. DESIGN: WE ANALYZED ADHERENCE DATA FROM A 3-ARM TRIAL INVOLVING 135 GENERALLY HEALTHY SENIORS 65-85 YEARS OF AGE RANDOMIZED TO A 6-MONTH INTERVENTION CONSISTING OF: AN IYENGAR YOGA CLASS WITH HOME PRACTICE, AN EXERCISE CLASS WITH HOME PRACTICE, OR A WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP. OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED COGNITIVE FUNCTION, MOOD, FATIGUE, ANXIETY, HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, AND PHYSICAL MEASURES. ADHERENCE TO THE INTERVENTION WAS OBTAINED BY CLASS ATTENDANCE AND BIWEEKLY HOME PRACTICE LOGS. RESULTS: THE DROP-OUT RATE WAS 13%. AMONG THE COMPLETERS OF THE TWO ACTIVE INTERVENTIONS, AVERAGE YOGA CLASS ATTENDANCE WAS 77% AND HOME PRACTICE OCCURRED 64% OF ALL DAYS. AVERAGE EXERCISE CLASS ATTENDANCE WAS 69% AND HOME EXERCISE OCCURRED 54% OF ALL DAYS. THERE WERE NO CLEAR EFFECTS OF ADHERENCE ON THE SIGNIFICANT STUDY OUTCOMES (QUALITY OF LIFE AND PHYSICAL MEASURES). CLASS ATTENDANCE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH BASELINE MEASURES OF DEPRESSION, FATIGUE, AND PHYSICAL COMPONENTS OF HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN BASELINE MEASURES WERE ALSO FOUND BETWEEN STUDY COMPLETERS AND DROP-OUTS IN THE ACTIVE INTERVENTIONS. ADHERENCE WAS NOT RELATED TO AGE, GENDER, OR EDUCATION LEVEL. CONCLUSION: HEALTHY SENIORS HAVE GOOD ATTENDANCE AT CLASSES WITH A PHYSICALLY ACTIVE INTERVENTION. HOME PRACTICE TAKES PLACE OVER HALF OF THE TIME. DECREASED ADHERENCE TO A POTENTIALLY BENEFICIAL INTERVENTION HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DECREASE THE EFFECT OF THE INTERVENTION IN A CLINICAL TRIAL BECAUSE SUBJECTS WHO MIGHT SUSTAIN THE GREATEST BENEFIT WILL RECEIVE A LOWER DOSE OF THE INTERVENTION AND SUBJECTS WITH HIGHER ADHERENCE RATES MAY BE FUNCTIONING CLOSER TO MAXIMUM ABILITY BEFORE THE INTERVENTION. STRATEGIES TO MAXIMIZE ADHERENCE AMONG SUBJECTS AT GREATER RISK FOR LOW ADHERENCE WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR FUTURE TRIALS, ESPECIALLY COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENTS REQUIRING GREATER EFFORT THAN SIMPLE PILL-TAKING.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
15  112  38 A PILOT STUDY OF A MINDFULNESS INFORMED YOGA INTERVENTION IN YOUNG PEOPLE WITH PSYCHOSIS. AIM: TO DETERMINE THE ACCEPTABILITY AND SAFETY OF A MINDFULNESS INFORMED YOGA INTERVENTION AS ADJUNCT TO USUAL CARE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WITH EARLY PSYCHOSIS. METHODS: PEOPLE AGED 16-25 YEARS ATTENDING A COMMUNITY-BASED SPECIALIST EARLY PSYCHOSIS CLINIC WERE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN A 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. THE INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF 1-H WEEKLY CLASSES OF MINDFULNESS INFORMED YOGA. ACCEPTABILITY WAS MEASURED BY UPTAKE, ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPANTS' SATISFACTION. SAFETY WAS MEASURED BY INCIDENCE OF PHYSICAL INJURY, PARTICIPANTS' LEVEL OF COMFORT, DISTRESS AND ANXIETY DURING THE SESSIONS, AND THE FOLLOWING MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES: POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE PSYCHOTIC, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY AND STRESS SYMPTOMS, SLEEP QUALITY AND FUNCTIONING. RESULTS: OF THOSE WHO CONSENTED TO THE STUDY, 80% (12) PARTICIPATED AND ON AVERAGE ATTENDED 4.4 YOGA CLASSES. THERE WERE NO PHYSICAL INJURIES AND PARTICIPANTS REPORTED MINIMAL DISTRESS AND ANXIETY. POST-INTERVENTION, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND AN IMPROVEMENT IN FUNCTION. CONCLUSIONS: MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA INTERVENTIONS ARE BOTH ACCEPTABLE AND SAFE AS AN INTERVENTION FOR YOUTH WITH EARLY PSYCHOSIS. THOUGH NUMBERS WERE SMALL, THE STUDY SHOWS PROMISE FOR YOGA AS A POTENTIALLY USEFUL INTERVENTION. IMPORTANTLY, THERE WAS NO DETERIORATION IN MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES. A LARGER TRIAL EVALUATING CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS IS NOW TIMELY.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
16 1684  31 OPEN TRIAL OF VINYASA YOGA FOR PERSISTENTLY DEPRESSED INDIVIDUALS: EVIDENCE OF FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF VINYASA YOGA AS AN ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSED PATIENTS WHO WERE NOT RESPONDING ADEQUATELY TO ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATION. THE AUTHORS ALSO PLANNED TO ASK PARTICIPANTS FOR QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK ON THEIR EXPERIENCE OF THE CLASS AND TO ASSESS CHANGE OVER TIME IN DEPRESSION AND IN POSSIBLE MEDIATING VARIABLES. THE AUTHORS RECRUITED 11 PARTICIPANTS IN 1 MONTH FOR AN 8-WEEK OPEN TRIAL OF YOGA CLASSES. THEY FOUND THAT 10 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENTS, 9 OF 10 WERE POSITIVE ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE, AND ALL PROVIDED FEEDBACK ABOUT WHAT WAS AND WAS NOT HELPFUL ABOUT YOGA, AS WELL AS BARRIERS TO CLASS ATTENDANCE. OVER THE 2-MONTH PERIOD, PARTICIPANTS EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN AN ASPECT OF MINDFULNESS AND IN BEHAVIOR ACTIVATION. THIS PILOT STUDY PROVIDED SUPPORT FOR CONTINUING TO INVESTIGATE VINYASA YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION.

17  252  35 A YOGA PROGRAM FOR THE SYMPTOMS OF POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER IN VETERANS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF A YOGA PROGRAM AS AN ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY FOR IMPROVING POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) SYMPTOMS IN VETERANS WITH MILITARY-RELATED PTSD. VETERANS (N = 12) PARTICIPATED IN A 6 WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION HELD TWICE A WEEK. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PTSD HYPERAROUSAL SYMPTOMS AND OVERALL SLEEP QUALITY AS WELL AS DAYTIME DYSFUNCTION RELATED TO SLEEP. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE TOTAL PTSD, ANGER, OR QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOME SCORES. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THIS YOGA PROGRAM MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY FOR IMPROVING HYPERAROUSAL SYMPTOMS OF PTSD INCLUDING SLEEP QUALITY. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT THE YOGA PROGRAM IS ACCEPTABLE, FEASIBLE, AND THAT THERE IS GOOD ADHERENCE IN A VETERAN POPULATION.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
18  181  49 A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA VS NONAEROBIC EXERCISE FOR VETERANS WITH PTSD: UNDERSTANDING EFFICACY, MECHANISMS OF CHANGE, AND MODE OF DELIVERY. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) IS A CHRONIC, DISABLING, AND PREVALENT MENTAL HEALTH DISORDER AMONG VETERANS. DESPITE THE AVAILABILITY OF EMPIRICALLY SUPPORTED PSYCHOTHERAPIES, MANY VETERANS REMAIN SYMPTOMATIC AFTER TREATMENT AND/OR PREFER TO SEEK COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH APPROACHES, INCLUDING YOGA, TO MANAGE PTSD. THE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) DESCRIBED HEREIN WILL EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF A MANUALIZED YOGA PROGRAM AS COMPARED TO NONAEROBIC EXERCISE IN REDUCING PTSD SEVERITY AMONG VETERANS. A SECONDARY AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS OF CHANGE. METHODS: VETERANS (N = 192) WITH PTSD WILL BE RANDOMIZED TO HATHA YOGA OR NONAEROBIC PHYSICAL ACTIVITY CONTROL; BOTH GROUPS CONSIST OF 12 WEEKLY, 60-MIN GROUP OR ONLINE TRAINING SESSIONS WITH 15-20 MIN OF DAILY AT-HOME PRACTICE. OUTCOME MEASURES WILL BE ADMINISTERED AT BASELINE, MID-TREATMENT, POSTTREATMENT, AND 12-WEEK FOLLOW-UP. PROJECTED OUTCOMES: THIS STUDY WILL EVALUATE CHANGES IN PTSD SEVERITY (PRIMARY OUTCOME) AS WELL AS DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, ANGER, SLEEP PROBLEMS, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL DISABILITY (SECONDARY OUTCOMES). WE WILL ALSO USE MULTIPLE MEDIATION TO EXAMINE TWO POTENTIAL MODELS OF THE MECHANISMS OF CLINICAL EFFECT: THE ATTENTION MODEL (I.E., YOGA INCREASES ATTENTIONAL CONTROL, WHICH REDUCES PTSD SYMPTOMS), THE COPING MODEL (I.E., YOGA INCREASES DISTRESS TOLERANCE, WHICH IMPROVES COPING, WHICH REDUCES PTSD SYMPTOMS), AND THE COMBINATION OF THESE MODELS. THIS ASPECT OF THE STUDY IS INNOVATIVE AND IMPORTANT GIVEN THE ABSENCE OF AN EXISTING, COMPREHENSIVE MODEL FOR UNDERSTANDING YOGA'S IMPACT ON PTSD. ULTIMATELY, WE HOPE TO DEVELOP GUIDELINES FOR APPLICATION OF YOGA TO PTSD RECOVERY.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
19  279  43 ADHERENCE AND RETENTION OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH A YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION: THE EFFECTS OF HEALTH PROMOTING PROGRAMS ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK STUDY. OBJECTIVES: SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE IS A RISK FACTOR FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (CVD). FEW ALTERNATIVE LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS YOGA PRACTICE, FOCUS ON AFRICAN AMERICANS (AA), THE POPULATION MOST VULNERABLE TO CVD. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO COMPARE THE RETENTION AND ADHERENCE RATES BETWEEN YOGA, WALKING, AND HEALTH EDUCATION INTERVENTIONS WHILE PROVIDING INFORMATION ABOUT THE ACCEPTANCE OF VARIOUS YOGA REGIMENS. DESIGN: THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY-FIVE AA PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED EXCLUSIVELY FROM AN ACTIVE COHORT STUDY AND RANDOMIZED INTO A 48-WEEK STUDY (24 WEEKS INTERVENTION, 24 WEEKS FOLLOW-UP) WITH 5 HEALTH PROMOTION INTERVENTIONS: HIGH FREQUENCY YOGA, MODERATE FREQUENCY YOGA, LOW FREQUENCY YOGA, GUIDED WALKING, AND HEALTH EDUCATION. IN ADDITION TO EXAMINING THE SEPARATE YOGA INTERVENTIONS, A POOLED YOGA INTERVENTION IS CONSIDERED FOR COMPARISON TO GUIDED WALKING AND HEALTH EDUCATION. PARTICIPANT RETENTION, ADHERENCE, AND VITALS WERE MONITORED AT EACH INTERVENTION SESSION. PARTICIPANTS WERE ALSO SCHEDULED FOR FOUR CLINIC VISITS THROUGHOUT THE STUDY WHERE BLOOD PANELS, HEALTH BEHAVIOR, AND MEDICATION SURVEYS WERE ADMINISTERED. RESULTS: OF THE 375 PARTICIPANTS RECRUITED, 31.7% DID NOT COMPLETE THE STUDY. AT BASELINE, IN BOTH THE GUIDED WALKING GROUP AND THE HIGH FREQUENCY YOGA GROUP, THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THOSE WHO COMPLETED THE STUDY AND THOSE WHO DID NOT. ALTHOUGH INTERVENTION RETENTION IN THE POOLED YOGA PROGRAM (78.3%) WAS HIGHER COMPARED TO THE WALKING (60%) AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS (74.3%) (P = 0.007), DIFFERENCES IN POST-INTERVENTION RETENTION WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT. MEDIAN ADHERENCE RATES FOR THE POOLED YOGA PROGRAM EXCEEDED RATES FOR GUIDED WALKING AND EDUCATION WITH MODERATE FREQUENCY YOGA OUT PERFORMING HIGH AND LOW FREQUENCY YOGA. CONCLUSION: STUDY-DEFINED RETENTION SUCCESS RATES WERE NOT REACHED BY ALL HEALTH PROMOTION PROGRAMS. HOWEVER, RETENTION AND ADHERENCE RATES FOR THE POOLED YOGA PROGRAM SHOW THAT OLDER AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE RECEPTIVE TO PARTICIPATING IN YOGA-BASED HEALTH PROMOTION PRACTICES.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
20 1541  34 KRIPALU YOGA FOR MILITARY VETERANS WITH PTSD: A RANDOMIZED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA FOR MILITARY VETERANS AND ACTIVE DUTY PERSONNEL WITH POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) EVALUATED THE EFFICACY OF A 10-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION ON PTSD. METHOD: FIFTY-ONE PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO YOGA OR NO-TREATMENT ASSESSMENT-ONLY CONTROL GROUPS. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED QUESTIONNAIRES AND THE CLINICIAN ADMINISTERED PTSD SCALE. RESULTS: BOTH YOGA (N = 9) AND CONTROL (N = 6) PARTICIPANTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN REEXPERIENCING SYMPTOMS, WITH NO SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCES. SECONDARY WITHIN-GROUP ANALYSES OF A SELF-SELECTED WAIT-LIST YOGA GROUP (N = 7) SHOWED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN PTSD SYMPTOMS AFTER YOGA PARTICIPATION, IN CONTRAST TO THEIR CONTROL GROUP PARTICIPATION. CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT LITERATURE REGARDING HIGH RATES OF PTSD TREATMENT DROPOUT FOR VETERANS, THIS STUDY FACED CHALLENGES RETAINING PARTICIPANTS ACROSS CONDITIONS. CONCLUSION: THESE RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH RECENT LITERATURE INDICATING THAT YOGA MAY HAVE POTENTIAL AS A PTSD THERAPY IN A VETERAN OR MILITARY POPULATION. HOWEVER, ADDITIONAL LARGER SAMPLE SIZE TRIALS ARE NECESSARY TO CONFIRM THIS CONCLUSION.	2018

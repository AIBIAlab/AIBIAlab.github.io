1 2626 92 YOGA FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER. YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO PLAY A ROLE IN REDUCING THE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INATTENTIVE AND HYPERACTIVE-IMPULSIVE FORMS OF ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (ADHD). THE MEDICAL HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS FOR A NINE-YEAR-OLD PATIENT PRESENTING WITH DIFFICULTY PAYING ATTENTION AND IMPULSIVE SPEECH AND ACTIONS AT HOME AND SCHOOL ARE PRESENTED. AFTER THE DIAGNOSIS OF COMBINATION TYPE ADHD BY ASSESSMENT OF DSM-5 CRITERIA, BOTH AT HOME AND SCHOOL AND THROUGH PARENT AND TEACHER EVALUATIONS USING NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR CHILDREN'S HEALTH QUALITY (NICHQ) VANDERBILT ASSESSMENT SCALES, THE PATIENT INITIATED A YOGA TRAINING REGIMEN. SIX MONTHS AFTER INITIATING THE YOGA TRAINING REGIMEN, FOLLOW-UP PARENT AND TEACHER QUESTIONNAIRES REVEALED IMPROVEMENT IN BOTH THE INATTENTIVE AND HYPERACTIVE-IMPULSIVE SYMPTOMS. LITERATURE SOURCED FROM THE PUBMED DATABASE TO EXPLORE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR ADHD WAS USED TO SUPPORT THE RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS THAT A STRUCTURED YOGA TRAINING REGIMEN IMPROVES THE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INATTENTIVE AND HYPERACTIVE-IMPULSIVE FORMS OF ADHD, AND THUS, YOGA IS RECOMMENDED AS A MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH ADHD.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
2 1048 30 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON ATTENTION, IMPULSIVITY, AND HYPERACTIVITY IN PRESCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN WITH ATTENTION-DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER SYMPTOMS. OBJECTIVE: BEHAVIORAL THERAPIES ARE FIRST-LINE FOR PRESCHOOLERS WITH ATTENTION-DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (ADHD). STUDIES SUPPORT YOGA FOR SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN WITH ADHD; THIS STUDY EVALUATED YOGA IN PRESCHOOLERS ON PARENT- AND TEACHER-RATED ATTENTION/CHALLENGING BEHAVIORS, ATTENTIONAL CONTROL (KINDER TEST OF ATTENTIONAL PERFORMANCE [KITAP]), AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV). METHODS: THIS RANDOMIZED WAITLIST-CONTROLLED TRIAL TESTED A 6-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION IN PRESCHOOLERS WITH >/=4 ADHD SYMPTOMS ON THE ADHD RATING SCALE-IV PRESCHOOL VERSION. GROUP 1 (N = 12) PRACTICED YOGA FIRST; GROUP 2 (N = 11) PRACTICED YOGA SECOND. WE COLLECTED DATA AT 4 TIME POINTS: BASELINE, T1 (6 WEEKS), T2 (12 WEEKS), AND FOLLOW-UP (3 MONTHS AFTER T2). RESULTS: AT BASELINE, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS. AT T1, GROUP 1 HAD FASTER REACTION TIMES ON THE KITAP GO/NO-GO TASK (P = 0.01, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI], -371.1 TO -59.1, D = -1.7), FEWER DISTRACTIBILITY ERRORS OF OMISSION (P = 0.009, 95% CI, -14.2 TO -2.3, D = -1.5), AND MORE COMMISSION ERRORS (P = 0.02, 95% CI, 1.4-14.8, D = 1.3) THAN GROUP 2. CHILDREN IN GROUP 1 WITH MORE SEVERE SYMPTOMS AT BASELINE SHOWED IMPROVEMENT AT T1 VERSUS CONTROL ON PARENT-RATED STRENGTHS AND DIFFICULTIES QUESTIONNAIRE HYPERACTIVITY INATTENTION (BETA = -2.1, P = 0.04, 95% CI, -4.0 TO -0.1) AND INATTENTION ON THE ADHD RATING SCALE (BETA = -4.4, P = 0.02, 95% CI, -7.9 TO -0.9). HRV MEASURES DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN GROUPS. CONCLUSION: YOGA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH MODEST IMPROVEMENTS ON AN OBJECTIVE MEASURE OF ATTENTION (KITAP) AND SELECTIVE IMPROVEMENTS ON PARENT RATINGS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
3  307 26 AN EVALUATION OF YOGA AND MEDITATION TO IMPROVE ATTENTION, HYPERACTIVITY, AND STRESS IN HIGH-SCHOOL STUDENTS. OBJECTIVE: PROBLEMS WITH ATTENTION AND STRESS ARE COMMON IN CHILDREN AND PREDICT ACADEMIC DIFFICULTIES AND OTHER BEHAVIORAL AND EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS. MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS YOGA AND MEDITATION IMPROVE ATTENTION AND REDUCE STRESS. IN THIS STUDY, WE EXAMINED THE IMPACT OF HATHA YOGA ON ATTENTION AND STRESS IN NINTH GRADERS. DESIGN: A TOTAL OF 174 NINTH GRADERS FROM A TEXAS HIGH SCHOOL WERE ENROLLED IN THE STUDY. TEACHERS ASSIGNED STUDENTS TO A YOGA GROUP (YG) OR CONTROL GROUP (CG) BASED ON THEIR CLASS SCHEDULE. THE YG PARTICIPATED IN 25-MIN HATHA YOGA CLASSES TWICE WEEKLY OVER 12 WEEKS (N = 123). THE CG INCLUDED 51 STUDENTS. STUDENT SELF-REPORTS ON MEASURES OF INATTENTION AND HYPERACTIVITY (THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF ADHD [ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER] SYMPTOMS AND NORMAL BEHAVIOR RATING SCALE FOR ADHD) AND STRESS (PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE) WERE OBTAINED AT BASELINE AND AT 12 WEEKS. RESULTS: THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN BASELINE LEVELS OF INATTENTION (P = 0.86), HYPERACTIVITY (P = 0.25), AND PERCEIVED STRESS (P = 0.28) BETWEEN THE YG AND CG. REGARDING INATTENTION SCORES, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION OF GROUP AND TIME (B = -1.09, STANDARD ERROR [SE] = 0.30, P < 0.001). PAIRWISE T-TESTS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN INATTENTION FOR THE YG (D = 0.27) BUT A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN INATTENTION FOR THE CG. REGARDING HYPERACTIVITY, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION OF GROUP AND TIME (B = -0.43, SE = 0.26, P = 0.1). PAIRWISE T-TESTS DEMONSTRATED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN HYPERACTIVITY FOR THE YG (D = 0.22), BUT NOT THE CG. THE INTERACTION OF GROUP AND TIME WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT IN PREDICTING THE SLOPE OF CHANGE IN PERCEIVED DISTRESS (B = -0.93, SE = 1.19, P = 0.43). PAIRWISE T-TESTS DID NOT SHOW A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PERCEIVED DISTRESS FOR EITHER GROUP. CONCLUSION: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT HATHA YOGA MAY IMPROVE ATTENTION AND HYPERACTIVITY IN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
4   30 23 12 WEEKS OF KINDERGARTEN-BASED YOGA PRACTICE INCREASES VISUAL ATTENTION, VISUAL-MOTOR PRECISION AND DECREASES BEHAVIOR OF INATTENTION AND HYPERACTIVITY IN 5-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN. THE PRESENT STUDY ASSESSES THE IMPACT OF KINDERGARTEN-BASED YOGA ON COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE, VISUAL-MOTOR COORDINATION, AND BEHAVIOR OF INATTENTION AND HYPERACTIVITY IN 5-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN. IN THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, 45 CHILDREN (28 FEMALE; 17 MALE; 5.2 +/- 0.4 YEARS) PARTICIPATED. OVER 12 WEEKS, 15 CHILDREN PERFORMED HATHA-YOGA TWICE A WEEK FOR 30 MIN, ANOTHER 15 CHILDREN PERFORMED GENERIC PHYSICAL EDUCATION (PE) TWICE A WEEK FOR 30 MIN, AND 15 CHILDREN PERFORMED NO KIND OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES, SERVING AS CONTROL GROUP (CG). PRIOR TO (T 0) AND AFTER 12 WEEKS (T 1), ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED VISUAL ATTENTION AND VISUOMOTOR PRECISION SUBTESTS OF NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION BATTERY AND TEACHERS EVALUATED CHILDREN'S BEHAVIOR OF INATTENTION AND HYPERACTIVITY WITH THE ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (ADHD) RATING SCALE-IV. AT T 0, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS APPEARED. REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE REVEALED THAT FOLLOWING BONFERRONI-HOLM CORRECTIONS YOGA, IN COMPARISON TO PE AND CG, HAD A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE DEVELOPMENT ON BEHAVIOR OF INATTENTION AND HYPERACTIVITY. FURTHER, YOGA HAS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACT ON COMPLETION TIMES IN TWO VISUMOTOR PRECISION TASKS IN COMPARISON TO PE. FINALLY, RESULTS INDICATE A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECT OF YOGA ON VISUAL ATTENTION SCORES IN COMPARISON TO CG. 12 WEEKS OF KINDERGARTEN-BASED YOGA IMPROVES SELECTED VISUAL ATTENTION AND VISUAL-MOTOR PRECISION PARAMETERS AND DECREASES BEHAVIOR OF INATTENTION AND HYPERACTIVITY IN 5-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN. CONSEQUENTLY, YOGA REPRESENTS A SUFFICIENT AND COST-BENEFIT EFFECTIVE EXERCISE WHICH COULD ENHANCE COGNITIVE AND BEHAVIORAL FACTORS RELEVANT FOR LEARNING AND ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AMONG YOUNG CHILDREN.	2019

PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: PRACTICING SUPER BRAIN YOGA REDUCED THE SYMPTOMS OF HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER AMONG THE SCHOOL-AGE CHILDREN.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
6 2188 33 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON THE ATTENTION AND BEHAVIOR OF BOYS WITH ATTENTION-DEFICIT/ HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (ADHD). BOYS DIAGNOSED WITH ADHD BY SPECIALIST PEDIATRICIANS AND STABILIZED ON MEDICATION WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A 20-SESSION YOGA GROUP (N = 11) OR A CONTROL GROUP (COOPERATIVE ACTIVITIES; N = 8). BOYS WERE ASSESSED PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION ON THE CONNERS' PARENT AND TEACHER RATING SCALES-REVISED: LONG (CPRS-R:L & CTRS-R:L; CONNERS, 1997), THE TEST OF VARIABLES OF ATTENTION (TOVA; GREENBERG, CORMNA, & KINDSCHI, 1997), AND THE MOTION LOGGER ACTIGRAPH. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING ONE-WAY REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA). SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS FROM PRE-TEST TO POST-TEST WERE FOUND FOR THE YOGA, BUT NOT FOR THE CONTROL GROUP ON FIVE SUBSCALES OF THE CONNERS' PARENTS RATING SCALES (CPRS): OPPOSITIONAL, GLOBAL INDEX EMOTIONAL LABILITY, GLOBAL INDEX TOTAL, GLOBAL INDEX RESTLESS/IMPULSIVE AND ADHD INDEX. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS FROM PRE-TEST TO POST-TEST WERE FOUND FOR THE CONTROL GROUP, BUT NOT THE YOGA GROUP ON THREE CPRS SUBSCALES: HYPERACTIVITY, ANXIOUS/SHY, AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS. BOTH GROUPS IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY ON CPRS PERFECTIONISM, DSM-IV HYPERACTIVE/ IMPULSIVE, AND DSM-IV TOTAL. FOR THE YOGA GROUP, POSITIVE CHANGE FROM PRE- TO POST-TEST ON THE CONNERS' TEACHER RATING SCALES (CTRS) WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NUMBER OF SESSIONS ATTENDED ON THE DSM-IV HYPERACTIVE-IMPULSIVE SUBSCALE AND WITH A TREND ON DSM-IV INATTENTIVE SUBSCALE. THOSE IN THE YOGA GROUP WHO ENGAGED IN MORE HOME PRACTICE SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT ON TOVA RESPONSE TIME VARIABILITY WITH A TREND ON THE ADHD SCORE, AND GREATER IMPROVEMENTS ON THE CTRS GLOBAL EMOTIONAL LABILITY SUBSCALE. RESULTS FROM THE MOTION LOGGER ACTIGRAPH WERE INCONCLUSIVE. ALTHOUGH THESE DATA DO NOT PROVIDE STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE USE OF YOGA FOR ADHD, PARTLY BECAUSE THE STUDY WAS UNDER-POWERED, THEY DO SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY HAVE MERIT AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR BOYS WITH ADHD ALREADY STABILIZED ON MEDICATION, PARTICULARLY FOR ITS EVENING EFFECT WHEN MEDICATION EFFECTS ARE ABSENT. YOGA REMAINS AN INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT, BUT THIS STUDY SUPPORTS FURTHER RESEARCH INTO ITS POSSIBLE USES FOR THIS POPULATION. THESE FINDINGS NEED TO BE REPLICATED ON LARGER GROUPS WITH A MORE INTENSIVE SUPERVISED PRACTICE PROGRAM.	2004	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
7  970 20 EFFECTS OF AN 8-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM ON SUSTAINED ATTENTION AND DISCRIMINATION FUNCTION IN CHILDREN WITH ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED WHETHER A YOGA EXERCISE INTERVENTION INFLUENCED THE SUSTAINED ATTENTION AND DISCRIMINATION FUNCTION IN CHILDREN WITH ADHD. FORTY-NINE PARTICIPANTS (MEAN AGE = 10.50 YEARS) WERE ASSIGNED TO EITHER A YOGA EXERCISE OR A CONTROL GROUP. PARTICIPANTS WERE GIVEN THE VISUAL PURSUIT TEST AND DETERMINATION TEST PRIOR TO AND AFTER AN EIGHT-WEEK EXERCISE INTERVENTION (TWICE PER WEEK, 40 MIN PER SESSION) OR A CONTROL INTERVENTION. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN ACCURACY RATE AND REACTION TIME OF THE TWO TESTS WERE OBSERVED OVER TIME IN THE EXERCISE GROUP COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES SUCH AS YOGA EXERCISES CAN BE COMPLEMENTARY TO BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS FOR CHILDREN WITH ATTENTION AND INHIBITION PROBLEMS. SCHOOLS AND PARENTS OF CHILDREN WITH ADHD SHOULD CONSIDER ALTERNATIVES FOR MAXIMIZING THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT CHILDREN WITH ADHD CAN ENGAGE IN STRUCTURED YOGA EXERCISES.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
8 1613 34 MILITARY-TAILORED YOGA FOR VETERANS WITH POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. INTRODUCTION: AMONG VETERANS OF POST-9/11 CONFLICTS, ESTIMATES OF POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) RANGE FROM 9% SHORTLY AFTER RETURNING FROM DEPLOYMENT TO 31% A YEAR AFTER DEPLOYMENT. CLINICAL AND PHARMACEUTICALLY BASED TREATMENTS ARE UNDERUTILIZED. THIS COULD BE DUE TO CONCERNS RELATED TO LOST DUTY DAYS, AS WELL AS PTSD PATIENTS' FEARS OF STIGMA OF HAVING A MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION. YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE PTSD SYMPTOMS IN THE CIVILIAN POPULATION, BUT FEW STUDIES HAVE TESTED THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON VETERANS OF POST-9/11 CONFLICTS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO TEST THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON POST-9/11 VETERANS DIAGNOSED WITH PTSD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE 18 YR OF AGE OR OLDER AND VETERANS OF POST-9/11 CONFLICTS. THEY HAD SUBTHRESHOLD OR DIAGNOSTIC-LEVEL PTSD RELATED TO THEIR COMBAT MILITARY SERVICE, AS DETERMINED BY A SCORE OF 30 OR HIGHER ON THE PTSD CHECKLIST-MILITARY VERSION (PCL-M). VETERANS PARTICIPATED IN 60-MIN WEEKLY YOGA SESSIONS FOR 6 WK TAUGHT BY A WARRIORS AT EASE-TRAINED YOGA INSTRUCTOR WHO IS A, POST-9/11 VETERAN. THE YOGA SESSIONS INCORPORATED VINYASA-STYLE YOGA AND A TRAUMA-SENSITIVE, MILITARY-CULTURE INFORMED APPROACH ADVOCATED BY TWO SEPARATE ORGANIZATIONS: WARRIORS AT EASE AND MEGHAN'S FOUNDATION. DATA WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE AND AGAIN AFTER 7 WK. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS PCL-M SCORE. PARTICIPANTS ALSO COMPLETED THE PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE, THE BECK ANXIETY INVENTORY, THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX, AND THE MINDFUL ATTENTION AWARENESS SCALE AT BOTH TIME POINTS. RESULTS: EIGHTEEN OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM, OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM, AND OPERATION NEW DAWN VETERANS COMPLETED THE PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES. AGE RANGED FROM 26 TO 62 YR (MEDIAN = 43 YR), LENGTH OF SERVICE RANGED FROM 2 TO 34 YR (MEDIAN = 18.8 YR), AND 13 (72.2%) HAD COMPLETED COLLEGE. DECREASED PTSD SYMPTOMATOLOGY WAS DEMONSTRATED IN THE THREE-SYMPTOM CLUSTERS REPRESENTED IN THE PCL-M (I.E., HYPERAROUSAL, RE-EXPERIENCING, AND AVOIDANCE). IN ADDITION, THE TOTAL SCORE ON THE PCL-M DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY, BY BOTH STATISTICAL AND CLINICAL MEASURES. THE PARTICIPANTS ALSO DEMONSTRATED IMPROVED MINDFULNESS SCORES AND REPORTED DECREASED INSOMNIA, DEPRESSION, AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT A TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA INTERVENTION MAY BE EFFECTIVE FOR VETERANS WITH PTSD SYMPTOMS, WHETHER AS STAND-ALONE OR ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY. THE IMPRESSIVE DECREASE IN PTSD SYMPTOMATOLOGY MAY BE DUE TO THE TAILORED MILITARY-SPECIFIC NATURE OF THIS INTERVENTION AND THE FACT THAT IT WAS LED BY A VETERAN OF POST-9/11 CONFLICTS. MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED WITH A LARGER SAMPLE AND A MORE DIVERSE VETERAN POPULATION.	2018	

9  252 18 A YOGA PROGRAM FOR THE SYMPTOMS OF POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER IN VETERANS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF A YOGA PROGRAM AS AN ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY FOR IMPROVING POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) SYMPTOMS IN VETERANS WITH MILITARY-RELATED PTSD. VETERANS (N = 12) PARTICIPATED IN A 6 WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION HELD TWICE A WEEK. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PTSD HYPERAROUSAL SYMPTOMS AND OVERALL SLEEP QUALITY AS WELL AS DAYTIME DYSFUNCTION RELATED TO SLEEP. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE TOTAL PTSD, ANGER, OR QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOME SCORES. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THIS YOGA PROGRAM MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY FOR IMPROVING HYPERAROUSAL SYMPTOMS OF PTSD INCLUDING SLEEP QUALITY. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT THE YOGA PROGRAM IS ACCEPTABLE, FEASIBLE, AND THAT THERE IS GOOD ADHERENCE IN A VETERAN POPULATION.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
10  948 25 EFFECTS OF A 6 WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION ON EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING IN WOMEN SCREENING POSITIVE FOR ADULT ADHD: A PILOT STUDY. PURPOSE: LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF YOGA TRAINING IN ADULTS WITH ADHD SYMPTOMS. THIS PILOT STUDY SOUGHT TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND SELECTED PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF 6 WEEKS OF YOGA TRAINING IN WOMEN SCREENING POSITIVE FOR ADULT ADHD COMPARED TO A WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP. METHODS: A RANDOMIZED TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED WITH 32 ADULT WOMEN (18-24 YEARS) WHO VOLUNTEERED AFTER SCREENING POSITIVE FOR ADULT ADHD AS ASSESSED BY THE ADULT ADHD SELF-REPORT SCALE (ASRS). PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO 6 WEEKS OF BIKRAM YOGA TRAINING OR TO A WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP. THE YOGA INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF TWO 90-MIN CLASSES PER WEEK. MULTILEVEL MODELS WERE USED TO TEST HYPOTHESIZED INTERACTIONS OF YOGA-INDUCED IMPROVEMENTS COMPARED TO CONTROLS ACROSS TIME (BASELINE, 3 WEEKS, AND 6 WEEKS). THE PRIMARY OUTCOMES ASSESSED INHIBITORY CONTROL, COGNITIVE FLEXIBILITY AND WORKING MEMORY USING THE NIH TOOLBOX. SEPARATE MODELS WITH TRAIT MINDFULNESS, TRAIT ANXIETY AND EXPECTATIONS FOR CHANGE IN EITHER ATTENTION OR WORKING MEMORY AS COVARIATES TESTED WHETHER THESE VARIABLES MEDIATED THE CHANGES IN THE THREE MEASURES OF EXECUTIVE FUNCTION. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED MOOD, PERCEIVED FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT AND MOTIVATION FOR, AND HYPERACTIVITY DURING, THE COGNITIVE TESTS. RESULTS: NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE OBSERVED. ATTENDANCE AVERAGED 91.7% AMONG THE 69% OF THE SAMPLE THAT DID NOT DROPOUT. NO SIGNIFICANT GROUP X TIME INTERACTIONS WERE FOUND FOR ANY OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES AND THE NULL EXECUTIVE FUNCTION FINDINGS WERE UNCHANGED WHEN INCLUDING THE COVARIATES. CONCLUSION: SIX-WEEKS OF YOGA TRAINING TWICE PER WEEK IS POTENTIALLY FEASIBLE FOR WOMEN EXPERIENCING ADHD SYMPTOMS, BUT AN EXERCISE STIMULUS OF THIS DURATION AND MAGNITUDE YIELDS NO BENEFICIAL COGNITIVE OR MOOD OUTCOMES.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
11  113 22 A PILOT STUDY OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR PTSD SYMPTOMS IN WOMEN. POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) IS A DEBILITATING CONDITION THAT AFFECTS APPROXIMATELY 10% OF WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES. ALTHOUGH EFFECTIVE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC TREATMENTS FOR PTSD EXIST, CLIENTS WITH PTSD REPORT ADDITIONAL BENEFITS OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES SUCH AS YOGA. IN PARTICULAR, YOGA MAY DOWNREGULATE THE STRESS RESPONSE AND POSITIVELY IMPACT PTSD AND COMORBID DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS. WE CONDUCTED A PILOT STUDY OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING A 12-SESSION KRIPALU-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION WITH AN ASSESSMENT CONTROL GROUP. PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED 38 WOMEN WITH CURRENT FULL OR SUBTHRESHOLD PTSD SYMPTOMS. DURING THE INTERVENTION, YOGA PARTICIPANTS SHOWED DECREASES IN REEXPERIENCING AND HYPERAROUSAL SYMPTOMS. THE ASSESSMENT CONTROL GROUP, HOWEVER, SHOWED DECREASES IN REEXPERIENCING AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AS WELL, WHICH MAY BE A RESULT OF THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF SELF-MONITORING ON PTSD AND ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS. BETWEEN-GROUPS EFFECT SIZES WERE SMALL TO MODERATE (0.08-0.31). ALTHOUGH MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED, YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT FOR PTSD. PARTICIPANTS RESPONDED POSITIVELY TO THE INTERVENTION, SUGGESTING THAT IT WAS TOLERABLE FOR THIS SAMPLE. FINDINGS UNDERSCORE THE NEED FOR FUTURE RESEARCH INVESTIGATING MECHANISMS BY WHICH YOGA MAY IMPACT MENTAL HEALTH SYMPTOMS, GENDER COMPARISONS, AND THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA PRACTICE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
12 1227 33 FEASIBILITY AND EFFICACY OF YOGA AS AN ADD-ON INTERVENTION IN ATTENTION DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER: AN EXPLORATORY STUDY. CONTEXT: ATTENTION DEFICIT-HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (ADHD) IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS. STIMULANT MEDICATION IS FREQUENTLY USED IN MANAGEMENT, WITH SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECTS. THERE IS A GROWING INTEREST IN COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENTS LIKE YOGA. AIMS: TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY IN CHILDREN WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE ADHD. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: THE STUDY WAS PERFORMED ON CHILDREN (CONSENT WAS TAKEN FROM PARENTS) ADMITTED IN A CHILD PSYCHIATRY UNIT USING AN OPEN-LABEL EXPLORATORY STUDY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CHILDREN BETWEEN 5 AND 16 YEARS OF AGE DIAGNOSED WITH ADHD AND CO-OPERATIVE FOR YOGA WERE INCLUDED. SUBJECTS WITH OTHER SERIOUS PSYCHIATRIC AND MEDICAL ILLNESSES WERE EXCLUDED. THE PARTICIPANTS WERE GIVEN YOGA TRAINING DAILY DURING THEIR IN-PATIENT STAY. THEY WERE RATED ON CONNERS' ABBREVIATED RATING SCALE - (CARS), ADHD-RATING SCALE-IV (ADHD - RS IV) AND CLINICAL GLOBAL IMPRESSION (CGI)-SEVERITY, AT THE BEGINNING OF STUDY, AT DISCHARGE AND SUBSEQUENTLY AT THE END OF 1(ST), 2(ND) AND 3(RD) MONTH BY A RESEARCH ASSOCIATE NOT INVOLVED IN YOGA INSTRUCTION. PAIRED T-TEST WAS EMPLOYED TO COMPARE THE MEANS OF SCORES BETWEEN BASELINE AND FOLLOW-UPS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 9 CHILDREN (8 MALES, 1 FEMALE) WERE RECRUITED INTO THE STUDY. ALL, BUT ONE WERE ON MEDICATIONS. AN AVERAGE OF 8 YOGA TRAINING SESSIONS WAS GIVEN TO SUBJECTS. THEY WERE ABLE TO LEARN YOGA REASONABLY WELL. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE ADHD SYMPTOMS AS ASSESSED ON CARS (P-0.014), ADHD-RS IV (P=0.021) AND CGI- S SCALES (P=0.004) AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
13  946 19 EFFECTS OF A 12-WEEKS YOGA INTERVENTION ON MOTOR AND COGNITIVE ABILITIES OF PRESCHOOL CHILDREN. SINCE EARLY CHILDHOOD IS REGARDED AS AN IMPORTANT PERIOD OF MOTOR AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT, UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECTS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ON MOTOR ABILITES AND COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT IN PRESCHOOL CHILDREN HAS MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH IMPLICATIONS. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE EFFECTS OF A 12 WEEKS' YOGA INTERVENTION PROGRAM ON MOTOR AND COGNITIVE ABILITIES IN PRESCHOOL CHILDREN. PRESCHOOL CHILDREN (N = 45; AGE 5-6 YEARS) ATTENDING REGULAR PRESCHOOL PROGRAMS WERE NON-RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO YOGA INTERVENTION (N = 23; 30 MIN SESSIONS THREE TIMES PER WEEK) OR A CONTROL GROUP (N = 22; NO ADDITIONAL ORGANIZED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PROGRAM). EXERCISE TRAINING FOR THE INTERVENTION GROUP INCLUDED YOGA PROGRAM. MOTOR ABILITIES (BOT-2 SUBTESTS: FINE MOTOR INTEGRATION, MANUAL DEXTERITY, BALANCE AND BILATERAL COORDINATION), AND COGNITIVE ABILITIES (SCHOOL MATURITY TEST SUBTESTS: VISUAL MEMORY, STACKING CUBES AND CODES) WERE ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION PERIOD IN BOTH GROUPS. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING REPEATED-MEASURES ANOVA.

PRESCHOOL CHILDREN'S PARTICIPATION IN THE PRESCHOOL YOGA INTERVENTION SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED THEIR MOTOR ABILITIES, BUT NOT THEIR COGNITIVE ABILITIES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
14 1412 29 IMPLEMENTATION OF A NON-RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION TO REDUCE BEHAVIOURAL ISSUES IN EARLY ADOLESCENT SCHOOL-GOING CHILDREN IN SRI LANKA. BACKGROUND: ADOLESCENCE CAN BE DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE AND THE POST-CONFLICT ENVIRONMENT IN JAFFNA PROVINCE, SRI LANKA COMPOUNDS EXISTING ISSUES FOR ADOLESCENTS. CONDUCT PROBLEMS, HYPERACTIVITY ALONG WITH EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS ARE CHALLENGES FACED BY ADOLESCENTS, PARTICULARLY IN FRAGILE, POST-CONFLICT SETTINGS. THIS STUDY WAS A NON-RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL CARRIED OUT IN 4 EDUCATIONAL ZONES OVER 6 MONTHS. THE STUDY IMPLEMENTED A YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION PACKAGE: TWO TYPES OF SLOW BREATHING FOR 5-6 MIN, SURYA-NAMASKARAM FOR 6-8 MIN, AND MINDFULNESS MEDITATION FOR 5-6 MIN. PRE/POST QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENTS WERE CONDUCTED WITH INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS. A FOCUS GROUP WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE INTERVENTION GROUP. THE AIM WAS TO EVALUATE. EFFECTIVENESS OF IMPLEMENTING A YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION PACKAGE IN GRADE 8 SCHOOL CHILDREN (EARLY ADOLESCENTS) TO ADDRESS BEHAVIOURAL PROBLEMS. RESULTS: PAIRED T-TEST AND INDEPENDENT T-TESTS WERE COMPLETED FOR BOTH ARMS USING STATISTICAL PRODUCT AND SERVICE SOLUTIONS (SPSS21). PARENTS' ASSESSMENTS OF EMOTIONAL ISSUES REDUCED FOR THE INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 584) [T(584) = 11.41, P = 0.001] ALONG WITH REDUCTION OF THE TOTAL DIFFICULTY SCORE [T(584) = 28.12, P = 0.001]. TEACHERS' ASSESSMENTS INDICATED PROSOCIAL SCORES IMPROVED IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP [T(584) = - 28.5, P = 0.001]. STUDENTS' SELF-ASSESSMENTS IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP INDICATE A REDUCTION IN EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS [T(584) = 6.4, P = 0.001], AND REDUCTION IN PROBLEMS WITH PEERS [T(584) = 14.4, P = 0.001]. WITHIN THE CONTROL GROUP (N = 499), TEACHERS' ASSESSMENTS INDICATED EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS INCREASED [T(499) = - 9.5, P = 0.001] AND PROSOCIAL SCORES REDUCED [T(499) = 13.5, P = 0.001]. STUDENTS' SELF-ASSESSMENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP INDICATED EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS INCREASED [T(499) = - 27.1, P = 0.001]. A COMPARISON OF POST-TEST SCORES REVEALED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS. FOCUS GROUP RESULTS INDICATE STUDENTS FELT THE INTERVENTION HAD AN OVERALL POSITIVE EFFECT ON SCHOOL ACHIEVEMENTS, FAMILY DYNAMICS AND INDIVIDUAL HEALTH. CONCLUSIONS: THIS YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION PACKAGE APPEARED TO BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING BOTH EXTERNALIZING AND INTERNALIZING SYMPTOMS IN ADOLESCENTS. PRACTICING SURYA-NAMASKARAM, BREATHING CONTROL TECHNIQUES AND MINDFULNESS MEDITATION SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BOTH EXTERNALIZING SYMPTOMS (CONDUCT PROBLEMS AND HYPERACTIVITY) AS WELL AS INTERNALIZING SYMPTOM (EMOTIONAL PROBLEM AND PEER PROBLEMS). IT IS RECOMMENDED THIS INTERVENTION BE SCALED UP ACROSS SRI LANKA AND OTHER SIMILAR POST-CONFLICT REGIONS.	2022	
                                     
15 2790 18 YOGA THERAPY FOR ANXIETY: A CASE REPORT. YOGA THERAPY IS A MIND-BODY INTERVENTION THAT CAN BE AN IMPORTANT SOLUTION IN THE TREATMENT OF ANXIETY. YOGA THERAPY ALLEVIATES THE HYPERAROUSAL OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM (SNS) AND THE HYPERVIGILANCE OF THE HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-ADRENAL (HPA) AXIS THAT OCCURS IN ANXIETY. YOGA THERAPY ACTIVATES THE PARASYMPATHETIC BRANCH OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM, REPLACING SNS OVERDRIVE, OR THE FLIGHT-OR-FIGHT RESPONSE, WITH THE RELAXATION RESPONSE AND BALANCING THE NERVOUS SYSTEM. YOGA THERAPY INCREASES POSITIVE COPING SKILLS AND BUILDS SELF-ESTEEM WITHOUT HARMFUL SIDE EFFECTS. THE RESULTS OF THIS CASE STUDY HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE CLINICAL EFFICACY OF YOGA THERAPY IN THE TREATMENT OF ANXIETY AND PANIC DISORDER (PD) IN AN ADOLESCENT FEMALE. TREATMENT CONSISTED OF 4 WKS OF INDIVIDUAL SESSIONS (60-MIN SESSION/WK) AND 6 WKS OF GROUP SESSIONS (90-MIN SESSION/WK) WITH DAILY HOME PRACTICE. THE RESULTS OF THE CASE STUDY ARE SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE GROWING NUMBERS OF YOUTH IN THE UNITED STATES ARE PRESENTING WITH ANXIETY AND SEEKING NONPHARMACOLOGICAL OPTIONS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
16  761 20 EFFECT OF SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA (SKY) ON DAYTIME AND SITUATIONAL SLEEP PROPENSITY IN NOVICE PRACTITIONERS: A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY. OBJECTIVES: HECTIC, LATE-NIGHT LIFESTYLE HAS REDUCED 90 MIN SLEEP IN 20% ADULTS RESULTING IN INSOMNIA AND EXCESSIVE DAYTIME SLEEPINESS (EDS). WE ASSESS THE SCOPE OF SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA (SKY), A 4-COMPONENT, BREATHING PROCESS IN REDUCING EDS, GENERALLY AND SITUATIONALLY. METHODS: THIS IS A PROSPECTIVE, CONTROLLED STUDY INVOLVING RANDOMIZED SUBJECTS WITHOUT ANY SLEEP-WAKE CYCLE ANOMALIES AND PRIOR EXPERIENCE IN SKY. SUBJECTS (N=52) PERFORMED 30 MIN OF SKY FOR 6 DAYS/WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS, WHILE CONTROLS (N=53) PERFORMED SITTING ACTIVITY AND SURYANAMASKAR FOR 4-WEEKS EACH. EPWORTH SLEEPINESS SCALE (ESS) WAS USED TO MEASURE EDS AT 0, 4, AND 8 WEEKS. RESULTS: SKY GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT ESS SCORE IMPROVEMENTS BETWEEN 0-4 WEEKS AND 4-8 WEEKS OF 1.22 (P=0.0001) AND 1.66 (P=0.001) RESPECTIVELY. CONTROLS HOWEVER FAILED TO IMPROVE WITH SCORE DIFFERENCES OF 0.02 (P=0.892) AND 0.02 (P=0.8212) RESPECTIVELY. SKY GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT ESS SCORE IMPROVEMENT OVER CONTROLS AT 4-WEEKS (DIFFERENCE=1.74; P=0.013) AND 8-WEEKS (DIFFERENCE EIGHT; P=0.0001). IMPROVEMENT WAS MOST FOR OBESE PEOPLE AND THOSE SITTING IN A HALTED CAR. CONCLUSIONS: IMPROVEMENT IN SUBJECTS' NIGHTTIME SLEEP AND DAYTIME WAKEFULNESS IN SKY PRACTITIONERS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO POLYVAGAL THEORY. INCREASED HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) ALTERATIONS AND SYMPATHETIC HYPERAROUSAL IN CHRONIC INSOMNIA; AND CHOLINERGIC AND GABAERGIC DYSREGULATION IN ANXIETY DISORDERS ARE COUNTERED BY REGULATED VAGAL NERVE STIMULATION POST SKY. OUR STUDY ESTABLISHES EFFECTIVITY OF SKY IN REDUCING EDS (TOTAL AND SITUATIONAL), PROVIDES A CLINICAL CORRELATION FOR PRIOR POLYSOMNOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE AND PAVES WAY FOR LARGER TRIALS DIRECTED TOWARDS SKY PRESCRIPTIONS FOR INSOMNIA.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
17 1652 32 MULTIMODAL BEHAVIOR PROGRAM FOR ADHD INCORPORATING YOGA AND IMPLEMENTED BY HIGH SCHOOL VOLUNTEERS: A PILOT STUDY. A LOW-COST RESOURCE APPROACH TO ADHD THERAPY WOULD BE A PRACTICAL APPROACH TO TREATING CHILDREN IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT ADHD IS PREVALENT IN ALL AREAS OF THE WORLD, AND YET TREATMENT FOR CHILDREN IN MORE IMPOVERISHED COUNTRIES IS STILL LACKING. THE APPROACH TAKEN WAS TO COMBINE YOGA AND MEDITATION COMBINED WITH MULTIMODAL BEHAVIORAL THERAPY PROGRAM FOR CHILDREN AGEING 6 TO 11. THE PROGRAM WAS KEPT LOW COST BY USING TRAINED HIGH SCHOOL VOLUNTEERS AND INTEGRATING THE PROGRAM WITHIN THE PUBLIC SCHOOL. AFTER 6 WEEKS OF THE PROGRAM, 90.5% OF CHILDREN SHOWED IMPROVEMENT AS MEASURED BY THEIR PERFORMANCE IMPAIRMENT SCORE, A MEASUREMENT OF ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE. PARENT AND TEACHER EVALUATIONS OF BEHAVIOR ALSO FOUND IMPROVEMENT AS 25 OF THE 64 CHILDREN (39.1%) IMPROVED INTO THE NORMAL RANGE AS MEASURED BY THE VANDERBILT QUESTIONNAIRE. MOREOVER, CHILDREN COULD SUCCESSFULLY LEARN BOTH YOGA AND MEDITATION FROM HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR AGE, ADHD TYPE, OR INITIAL PERFORMANCE IMPAIRMENT. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE EFFICACY OF A MULTIMODAL BEHAVIORAL PROGRAM INCORPORATING YOGA AND MEDITATION. THE USE OF HIGH SCHOOL VOLUNTEERS FROM SCHOOLS IN THE AREA DEMONSTRATES AN EFFECTIVE LOW-COST AND UNIVERSALLY APPLICABLE APPROACH.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
18 2241 20 THE INFLUENCE OF HATHA YOGA AS AN ADD-ON TREATMENT IN MAJOR DEPRESSION ON HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-ADRENAL-AXIS ACTIVITY: A RANDOMIZED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: THE IMPACT OF HATHA YOGA AS ADD-ON TREATMENT TO QUETIAPINE FUMARATE EXTENDED RELEASE (QXR) OR ESCITALOPRAM (ESC) IN DEPRESSED PATIENTS ON HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-ADRENAL (HPA) AXIS ACTIVITY WAS ASSESSED. METHODS: 60 INPATIENTS SUFFERING FROM MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD) ACCORDING TO DSM-IV WERE RANDOMIZED FOR A 5 WEEK TREATMENT WITH YOGA OR NOT (CONTROL GROUP) AND WITH EITHER QXR (300 MG/DAY) OR ESC (10 MG/DAY). SERIAL DEXAMETHASONE/CORTICOTROPIN RELEASING HORMONE (DEX/CRH) TESTS WERE PERFORMED TO ASSESS HPA AXIS FUNCTION. THE HAMILTON DEPRESSION RATING SCALE (21-HAMD) WAS USED WEEKLY. RESULTS: A MORE PRONOUNCED DOWN REGULATION OF THE HPA AXIS ACTIVITY DUE TO YOGA COULD NOT BE DETECTED. THE STEPWISE LONG TERM CORTISOL REDUCTION WAS SEEN IN BOTH MEDICATION GROUPS, IRRESPECTIVELY OF YOGA ADD-ON TREATMENT. IN ADDITION, CORTISOL IMPROVERS IN WEEK 1 OF THERAPY (REDUCTION IN CORTISOL PEAK VALUE WITHIN THE DEX/CRH TEST) REACHED SIGNIFICANT GREATER AMELIORATION OF DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AFTER 5 WEEKS. CONCLUSIONS: OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ANTIDEPRESSANT AGENTS DOWN REGULATE HPA AXIS FUNCTION TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN ADDITIONAL HATHA YOGA TREATMENT. MOREOVER, AN EARLY REDUCTION OF HPA SYSTEM HYPERACTIVITY AFTER ONE WEEK OF PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT SEEMS TO RAISE THE POSSIBILITY OF A FAVORABLE TREATMENT RESPONSE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
19  951 18 EFFECTS OF A CLASSROOM-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION ON CORTISOL AND BEHAVIOR IN SECOND- AND THIRD-GRADE STUDENTS: A PILOT STUDY. THIS UNCONTROLLED PILOT STUDY EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF A CLASSROOM-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION ON CORTISOL CONCENTRATIONS AND PERCEIVED BEHAVIOR IN CHILDREN. A 10-WEEK YOGA 4 CLASSROOMS INTERVENTION WAS IMPLEMENTED IN ONE SECOND-GRADE AND ONE THIRD-GRADE CLASSROOM. STUDENTS' SALIVARY CORTISOL RESPONSES WERE ASSESSED AT 3 TIME POINTS. CLASSROOM TEACHERS ALSO DOCUMENTED THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF THE EFFECTS OF THE INTERVENTION ON STUDENTS' COGNITIVE, SOCIAL, AND EMOTIONAL SKILLS. SECOND, BUT NOT THIRD, GRADERS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN BASELINE CORTISOL FROM BEFORE TO AFTER THE INTERVENTION. SECOND AND THIRD GRADERS BOTH SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN CORTISOL FROM BEFORE TO AFTER A COGNITIVE TASK, BUT NEITHER GRADE SHOWED ADDITIONAL DECREASES FROM BEFORE TO AFTER A SINGLE YOGA CLASS. THE SECOND-GRADE TEACHER PERCEIVED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN SEVERAL ASPECTS HIS/HER STUDENTS' BEHAVIOR. THE THIRD-GRADE TEACHER PERCEIVED SOME, BUT FEWER, IMPROVEMENTS IN HIS/HER STUDENTS' BEHAVIOR. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT SCHOOL-BASED YOGA MAY BE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR STRESS MANAGEMENT AND BEHAVIOR.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
20   19 25 "WE REALLY NEED THIS": TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA FOR VETERAN WOMEN WITH A HISTORY OF MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA. OBJECTIVES: UP TO 70% OF WOMEN SERVICE MEMBERS IN THE UNITED STATES REPORT MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA (MST); MANY DEVELOP POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) AND CO-OCCURRING DISORDERS. TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA (TIY) IS SUGGESTED TO IMPROVE PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS AND SHOWN FEASIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE IN EMERGING RESEARCH, YET NO WORK HAS EVALUATED TIY IN MST SURVIVORS. THE CURRENT QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT AIMED TO EXAMINE TIY'S FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND PERCEIVED EFFECTS IN THE CONTEXT OF MST. DESIGN: COLLECTIVE CASE SERIES (N = 7). SETTING: NEW ENGLAND VET CENTER. INTERVENTIONS: EXTANT TIY PROGRAM (MINDFUL YOGA THERAPY) ADAPTED FOR VETERAN WOMEN WITH MST IN CONCURRENT PSYCHOTHERAPY. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ATTRITION AND ATTENDANCE; QUALITATIVE EXIT INTERVIEW; VALIDATED SELF-REPORT MEASURE OF NEGATIVE AFFECT PRE/POST EACH YOGA CLASS, AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY ASSESSMENTS AND SURVEYS BEFORE (T1; TIME 1) AND AFTER THE YOGA PROGRAM (T2; TIME 2). RESULTS: FEASIBILITY WAS DEMONSTRATED AND WOMEN REPORTED TIY WAS ACCEPTABLE. IN QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS, WOMEN REPORTED IMPROVED SYMPTOM SEVERITY, DIET, EXERCISE, ALCOHOL USE, SLEEP, AND PAIN; REDUCED MEDICATION USE; AND THEMES RELATED TO STRESS REDUCTION, MINDFULNESS, AND SELF-COMPASSION. REGARDING QUANTITATIVE CHANGE, RESULTS SUGGEST ACUTE REDUCTIONS IN NEGATIVE AFFECT FOLLOWING YOGA SESSIONS ACROSS PARTICIPANTS, AS WELL AS IMPROVED AFFECT DYSREGULATION, SHAME, AND MINDFULNESS T1 TO T2. CONCLUSIONS: TIY IS BOTH FEASIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE TO VETERAN WOMEN MST SURVIVORS IN ONE SPECIFIC VET CENTER, WITH PERCEIVED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BENEFITS. RESULTS SUGGEST TIY MAY TARGET PSYCHOSOCIAL MECHANISMS IMPLICATED IN HEALTH BEHAVIOR CHANGE (STRESS REDUCTION, MINDFULNESS, AFFECT REGULATION, SHAME). FORMAL RESEARCH SHOULD BE CONDUCTED TO CONFIRM THESE QI PROJECT RESULTS.	2021

1 2321 120 TREATMENT OF CHRONIC INSOMNIA WITH YOGA: A PRELIMINARY STUDY WITH SLEEP-WAKE DIARIES. THERE IS GOOD EVIDENCE FOR COGNITIVE AND PHYSIOLOGICAL AROUSAL IN CHRONIC INSOMNIA. ACCORDINGLY, CLINICAL TRIAL STUDIES OF INSOMNIA TREATMENTS AIMED AT REDUCING AROUSAL, INCLUDING RELAXATION AND MEDITATION, HAVE REPORTED POSITIVE RESULTS. YOGA IS A MULTICOMPONENT PRACTICE THAT IS ALSO KNOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING AROUSAL, ALTHOUGH IT HAS NOT BEEN WELL EVALUATED AS A TREATMENT FOR INSOMNIA. IN THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY, A SIMPLE DAILY YOGA TREATMENT WAS EVALUATED IN A CHRONIC INSOMNIA POPULATION CONSISTING OF SLEEP-ONSET AND/OR SLEEP-MAINTENANCE INSOMNIA AND PRIMARY OR SECONDARY INSOMNIA. PARTICIPANTS MAINTAINED SLEEP-WAKE DIARIES DURING A PRETREATMENT 2-WEEK BASELINE AND A SUBSEQUENT 8-WEEK INTERVENTION, IN WHICH THEY PRACTICED THE TREATMENT ON THEIR OWN FOLLOWING A SINGLE IN-PERSON TRAINING SESSION WITH SUBSEQUENT BRIEF IN-PERSON AND TELEPHONE FOLLOW-UPS. SLEEP EFFICIENCY (SE), TOTAL SLEEP TIME (TST), TOTAL WAKE TIME (TWT), SLEEP ONSET LATENCY (SOL), WAKE TIME AFTER SLEEP ONSET (WASO), NUMBER OF AWAKENINGS, AND SLEEP QUALITY MEASURES WERE DERIVED FROM SLEEP-WAKE DIARY ENTRIES AND WERE AVERAGED IN 2-WEEK INTERVALS. FOR 20 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETING THE PROTOCOL, STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE OBSERVED IN SE, TST, TWT, SOL, AND WASO AT END-TREATMENT AS COMPARED WITH PRETREATMENT VALUES.	2004	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
2 2726  46 YOGA NIDRA PRACTICE SHOWS IMPROVEMENT IN SLEEP IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC INSOMNIA: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND YOGA NIDRA IS PRACTISED BY SAGES FOR SLEEP. THE PRACTICE IS SIMPLE TO USE AND HAS BEEN CLEARLY LAID OUT, BUT ITS ROLE IN THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC INSOMNIA HAS NOT BEEN WELL STUDIED. METHODS IN THIS RANDOMIZED PARALLEL-DESIGN STUDY CONDUCTED DURING 2012-16, WE ENROLLED 41 PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC INSOMNIA TO RECEIVE CONVENTIONAL INTERVENTION OF COGNITIVE BEHAVIOURAL THERAPY FOR INSOMNIA (N=20) OR YOGA NIDRA (N=21). OUTCOME MEASURES WERE BOTH SUBJECTIVE USING A SLEEP DIARY AND OBJECTIVE USING POLYSOMNOGRAPHY (PSG). SALIVARY CORTISOL LEVELS WERE ALSO MEASURED. PSG WAS DONE BEFORE THE INTERVENTION IN ALL PATIENTS AND REPEATED ONLY IN THOSE WHO VOLUNTEERED FOR THE SAME. RESULTS BOTH INTERVENTIONS SHOWED AN IMPROVEMENT IN SUBJECTIVE TOTAL SLEEP TIME (TST), SLEEP EFFICIENCY, WAKE AFTER SLEEP ONSET, REDUCTION IN TOTAL WAKE DURATION AND ENHANCEMENT IN SUBJECTIVE SLEEP QUALITY. OBJECTIVELY, BOTH THE INTERVENTIONS IMPROVED TST AND TOTAL WAKE DURATION AND INCREASED N1% OF TST. YOGA NIDRA SHOWED MARKED IMPROVEMENT IN N2% AND N3% IN TST. SALIVARY CORTISOL REDUCED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER YOGA NIDRA (P=0.041). CONCLUSION IMPROVEMENT OF N3 SLEEP, TOTAL WAKE DURATION AND SUBJECTIVE SLEEP QUALITY OCCURRED FOLLOWING YOGA NIDRA PRACTICE. YOGA NIDRA PRACTICE CAN BE USED FOR TREATMENT OF CHRONIC INSOMNIA AFTER SUPERVISED PRACTICE SESSIONS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
3 1020  42 EFFECTS OF YOGA AND AEROBIC EXERCISE ON ACTIGRAPHIC SLEEP PARAMETERS IN MENOPAUSAL WOMEN WITH HOT FLASHES. STUDY OBJECTIVES: TO DETERMINE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND AEROBIC EXERCISE COMPARED WITH USUAL ACTIVITY ON OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENTS OF SLEEP IN MIDLIFE WOMEN. METHODS: SECONDARY ANALYSES OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IN THE MENOPAUSE STRATEGIES: FINDING LASTING ANSWERS FOR SYMPTOMS AND HEALTH (MSFLASH) NETWORK CONDUCTED AMONG 186 LATE TRANSITION AND POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN AGED 40-62 Y WITH HOT FLASHES. WOMEN WERE RANDOMIZED TO 12 W OF YOGA, SUPERVISED AEROBIC EXERCISE, OR USUAL ACTIVITY. THE MEAN AND COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION (CV) OF CHANGE IN ACTIGRAPH SLEEP MEASURES FROM EACH INTERVENTION GROUP WERE COMPARED TO THE USUAL ACTIVITY GROUP USING LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS. RESULTS: BASELINE VALUES OF THE PRIMARY SLEEP MEASURES FOR THE ENTIRE SAMPLE WERE MEAN TOTAL SLEEP TIME (TST) = 407.5 +/- 56.7 MIN; MEAN WAKE AFTER SLEEP ONSET (WASO) = 54.6 +/- 21.8 MIN; MEAN CV FOR WASO = 37.7 +/- 18.7 AND MEAN CV FOR NUMBER OF LONG AWAKENINGS > 5 MIN = 81.5 +/- 46.9. CHANGES IN THE ACTIGRAPHIC SLEEP OUTCOMES FROM BASELINE TO WEEKS 11-12 WERE SMALL, AND NONE DIFFERED BETWEEN GROUPS. IN AN EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS, WOMEN WITH BASELINE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX HIGHER THAN 8 HAD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED TST-CV FOLLOWING YOGA COMPARED WITH USUAL ACTIVITY. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY ADDS TO THE CURRENTLY SCANT LITERATURE ON OBJECTIVE SLEEP OUTCOMES FROM YOGA AND AEROBIC EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS FOR THIS POPULATION. ALTHOUGH SMALL EFFECTS ON SELF-REPORTED SLEEP QUALITY WERE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE INTERVENTIONS HAD NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON ACTIGRAPH MEASURES, EXCEPT FOR POTENTIALLY IMPROVED SLEEP STABILITY WITH YOGA IN WOMEN WITH POOR SELF-REPORTED SLEEP QUALITY.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
4 2323  51 TREATMENT OF CHRONIC PRIMARY SLEEP ONSET INSOMNIA WITH KUNDALINI YOGA: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH ACTIVE SLEEP HYGIENE COMPARISON. STUDY OBJECTIVES: PRIOR STUDIES HAVE SUGGESTED A BENEFIT OF YOGA FOR ALLEVIATING SLEEP DISTURBANCE; HOWEVER, MANY STUDIES HAVE HAD METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS. THIS TRIAL STUDY AIMED TO EXTEND THAT LITERATURE BY INCLUDING AN ACTIVE SLEEP HYGIENE COMPARISON. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS AGED 25-59 YEARS WITH A PRIMARY COMPLAINT OF SLEEP ONSET INSOMNIA LASTING AT LEAST 6 MONTHS WERE BLOCK RANDOMIZED TO AN 8-WEEK KUNDALINI YOGA OR SLEEP HYGIENE INTERVENTION, BOTH CONSISTING OF INITIAL 60-MINUTE INSTRUCTION AND WEEKLY CHECK-INS. DAILY SLEEP DIARIES AND QUESTIONNAIRES WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE, THROUGHOUT THE INTERVENTION, AND AT 6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING LINEAR MIXED MODELS (N = 20 IN EACH GROUP). RESULTS: PARTICIPANT RATINGS OF THE INTERVENTIONS DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFER. SLEEP HYGIENE IMPROVED SEVERAL DIARY AND QUESTIONNAIRE OUTCOMES, HOWEVER, YOGA RESULTED IN EVEN GREATER IMPROVEMENTS CORRESPONDING TO MEDIUM-TO-LARGE BETWEEN-GROUP EFFECT SIZES. TOTAL SLEEP TIME INCREASED PROGRESSIVELY ACROSS YOGA TREATMENT (D = 0.95, P = .002), CONCURRENT WITH INCREASED SLEEP EFFICIENCY (D = 1.36, P < .001) AND DECREASED SLEEP ONSET LATENCY (D = -1.16, P < .001), BUT WITHOUT CHANGES IN PRE-SLEEP AROUSAL (D =-0.30, P = .59). REMISSION RATES WERE ALSO HIGHER FOR YOGA COMPARED TO SLEEP HYGIENE, WITH >/= 80% OF YOGA PARTICIPANTS REPORTING AVERAGE SLEEP ONSET LATENCY < 30 MINUTES AND SLEEP EFFICIENCY > 80% AT 6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. FOR OVER 50% OF YOGA PARTICIPANTS, THE INSOMNIA SEVERITY INDEX DECREASED BY AT LEAST 8 POINTS AT END OF TREATMENT AND FOLLOW-UP. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA, TAUGHT IN A SELF-CARE FRAMEWORK WITH MINIMAL INSTRUCTOR BURDEN, WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SELF-REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS ABOVE AND BEYOND AN ACTIVE SLEEP HYGIENE COMPARISON, SUSTAINED AT 6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. FOLLOW-UP STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO ASSESS ACTIGRAPHY AND POLYSOMNOGRAPHY OUTCOMES, AS WELL AS POSSIBLE MECHANISMS OF CHANGE.

5  570  37 DECREASED NOCTURNAL AWAKENINGS IN YOUNG ADULTS PERFORMING BIKRAM YOGA: A LOW-CONSTRAINT HOME SLEEP MONITORING STUDY. THIS PILOT STUDY EVALUATED THE IMPACT OF BIKRAM YOGA ON SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE SLEEP PARAMETERS. WE COMPARED SUBJECTIVE (DIARY) AND OBJECTIVE (HEADBAND SLEEP MONITOR) SLEEP MEASURES ON YOGA VERSUS NONYOGA DAYS DURING A 14-DAY PERIOD. SUBJECTS (N = 13) WERE NOT CONSTRAINED REGARDING YOGA-PRACTICE DAYS, OTHER EXERCISE, CAFFEINE, ALCOHOL, OR NAPS. THESE ACTIVITIES DID NOT SEGREGATE BY CHOICE OF YOGA DAYS. STANDARD SLEEP METRICS WERE UNAFFECTED BY YOGA, INCLUDING SLEEP LATENCY, TOTAL SLEEP TIME, AND PERCENTAGE OF TIME SPENT IN RAPID EYE MOVEMENT (REM), LIGHT NON-REM, DEEP NON-REM, OR WAKE AFTER SLEEP ONSET (WASO). CONSISTENT WITH PRIOR WORK, TRANSITION PROBABILITY ANALYSIS WAS A MORE SENSITIVE INDEX OF SLEEP ARCHITECTURE CHANGES THAN STANDARD METRICS. SPECIFICALLY, BIKRAM YOGA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER RETURN TO SLEEP AFTER NOCTURNAL AWAKENINGS. WE CONCLUDE THAT OBJECTIVE HOME SLEEP MONITORING IS FEASIBLE IN A LOW-CONSTRAINT, REAL-WORLD STUDY DESIGN. FURTHER STUDIES ON PATIENTS WITH INSOMNIA WILL DETERMINE WHETHER THE RESULTS GENERALIZE OR NOT.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
6   47  38 A CLOSER LOOK AT YOGA NIDRA: SLEEP LAB PROTOCOL. EXTENDED SLEEP ONSET LATENCY (SOL), OR "SLEEP ONSET INSOMNIA," CAN DECREASE TOTAL SLEEP TIME, INCREASING RISK FOR MANY HEALTH CONDITIONS, INCLUDING HEART DISEASE, STROKE, AND ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY. SLEEP DISORDERS PERSIST IN THE UNITED STATES DESPITE CURRENT BEHAVIORAL/PHARMACEUTICAL REMEDIES, WITH 10% TO 15% OF THE POPULATION SUFFERING FROM INSOMNIA. MIND-BODY THERAPIES OFFER ADDITIONAL SOLUTIONS, AS MEDITATION HAS BEEN CORRELATED WITH DECREASED SOL. MORE RESEARCH ON USE OF MIND-BODY PRACTICES FOR INSOMNIA IS NEEDED. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE GUIDED MEDITATION PRACTICE OF YOGA NIDRA (YOGIC SLEEP) AS A PROMISING INTERVENTION FOR SLEEP DISORDERS BECAUSE OF ITS PURPORTED ABILITY TO INDUCE MENTAL, PHYSICAL, AND EMOTIONAL RELAXATION. IN THIS PILOT STUDY, WE ADDRESS THE FEASIBILITY OF YOGA NIDRA FOR INSOMNIA, APPROPRIATENESS OF OUR SELECTED MEASUREMENT SYSTEMS, AND EFFECT OF YOGA NIDRA ON BRAINWAVES, SLEEP ONSET, AND THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM. OUR STUDY SAMPLE INCLUDES 22 ADULTS, AGES 18-45, WITH INSOMNIA. THE DESIGN INCLUDES TWO CLINIC VISITS (V1, LYING QUIETLY FOR 90 MIN; V2, RANDOMIZATION TO 90-MIN LYING QUIETLY VS. 30-MIN YOGA NIDRA PLUS 60-MIN LYING QUIETLY), TAKING PLACE 1 TO 14 DAYS APART. OUTCOMES MEASURED DURING/AFTER YOGA NIDRA (VS. CONTROL) INCLUDE SLEEP ONSET, ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY (EEG) POWER, HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV), AND RESPIRATORY RATE. SELF-REPORTED MOOD AND ANXIETY WILL BE MEASURED BEFORE/AFTER EACH VISIT. RESULTING PHYSIOLOGICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND FEASIBILITY DATA WILL BE USED TO INFORM FUTURE CLINICAL STUDIES OF YOGA NIDRA FOR SLEEP AND RELAXATION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
7  117  43 A PILOT STUDY OF GENTLE YOGA FOR SLEEP DISTURBANCE IN WOMEN WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS. OBJECTIVES: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO TEST THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF A GENTLE YOGA INTERVENTION FOR SLEEP DISTURBANCE IN OLDER WOMEN WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) AND TO COLLECT INITIAL EFFICACY DATA ON THE INTERVENTION. METHODS: ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED AN 8-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM THAT INCLUDED 75-MIN WEEKLY CLASSES AND 20 MIN OF NIGHTLY HOME PRACTICE. PARTICIPANTS WERE WOMEN WITH OA AND SYMPTOMS CONSISTENT WITH INSOMNIA. SYMPTOM QUESTIONNAIRES AND 1 WEEK OF WRIST ACTIGRAPHY AND SLEEP DIARIES WERE COMPLETED FOR 1 WEEK PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION. RESULTS: FOURTEEN WOMEN WERE ENROLLED OF WHOM 13 COMPLETED THE STUDY (MEAN AGE 65.2 +/- 6.9 YEARS). PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED A MEAN OF 7.2 +/- 1.0 CLASSES AND PRACTICED AT HOME 5.83 +/- 1.66 NIGHTS/WEEK. THE INSOMNIA SEVERITY INDEX AND DIARY-REPORTED SLEEP ONSET LATENCY, SLEEP EFFICIENCY, AND NUMBER OF NIGHTS WITH INSOMNIA WERE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED AT POST-INTERVENTION VERSUS PRE-INTERVENTION (P < .05). OTHER SLEEP OUTCOMES (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX, EPWORTH SLEEPINESS SCALE, DIARY-REPORTED TOTAL SLEEP TIME AND WAKE AFTER SLEEP ONSET) SHOWED IMPROVEMENT ON MEAN SCORES AT POST-INTERVENTION, BUT THESE WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. ACTIGRAPHIC SLEEP OUTCOMES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY SUPPORTS THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF A STANDARDIZED EVENING YOGA PRACTICE FOR MIDDLE-AGED TO OLDER WOMEN WITH OA. PRELIMINARY EFFICACY FINDINGS SUPPORT FURTHER RESEARCH ON THIS PROGRAM AS A POTENTIAL TREATMENT OPTION FOR OA-RELATED INSOMNIA.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
8 2218  42 THE IMPACT OF A YOGA-BASED PHYSICAL THERAPY GROUP FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY: RESULTS FROM A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO COMPARE THE IMPACTS OF YOGA-BASED PHYSICAL THERAPY VERSUS A SEATED REST WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF STANDARD REHABILITATION PRACTICE ON SLEEP, HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV), ANXIETY, AND FATIGUE DURING ACUTE TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI) REHABILITATION. METHODS: ELEVEN INDIVIDUALS PARTICIPATED IN THIS CROSSOVER STUDY INVOLVING THE FOLLOWING INTERVENTIONS IN A RANDOMIZED ORDER: GROUP YOGA-BASED PHYSICAL THERAPY (YPT), CONVENTIONAL PHYSICAL THERAPY (CPT), AND GROUP SEATED REST IN A RELAXING ENVIRONMENT (SR). HRV AND SELF-REPORTED ANXIETY AND FATIGUE WERE MEASURED IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND AFTER EACH GROUP, AND SLEEP AFTER EACH CONDITION AND AT BASELINE. DATA WAS ANALYZED USING GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODELS WITH REPEATED MEASURES. RESULTS: THE INTERACTION BETWEEN TIME AND TREATMENT WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P = .0203). FOR THE SR TREATMENT, WAKE AFTER SLEEP ONSET (WASO) RATE WAS REDUCED FROM 14.99 TO 10.60 (IRR = 0.71; P = .006). TIME AND TREATMENT WERE NOT FOUND TO BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH ANY OF THE SECONDARY OUTCOMES. CONCLUSION: YOGA-BASED PHYSICAL THERAPY IS FEASIBLE AND SAFE IN THE INPATIENT REHABILITATION SETTING FOLLOWING TBI. SLEEP QUALITY IMPROVED FOLLOWING THE ADDITION OF A ONE-HOUR SEATED REST IN A RELAXING ENVIRONMENT TO A STANDARD REHABILITATION DAILY SCHEDULE, SUGGESTING THAT STRUCTURED REST TIME MAY BE BENEFICIAL TO SLEEP HYGIENE DURING INPATIENT REHABILITATION FOLLOWING TBI.

9 1980  36 SLEEP MODERATES THE EFFECTS OF TIBETAN YOGA FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY. THIS STUDY EXAMINED SELF-REPORTED AND ACTIGRAPHY-ASSESSED SLEEP AND DEPRESSION AS MODERATORS OF THE EFFECT OF A TIBETAN YOGA INTERVENTION ON SLEEP AND DEPRESSION AMONG WOMEN UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY FOR BREAST CANCER. THIS IS A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF AN RCT EXAMINING A 4-SESSION TIBETAN YOGA PROGRAM (TYP; N = 74) VERSUS STRETCHING PROGRAM (STP; N = 68) OR USUAL CARE (UC; N = 85) ON SELF-REPORTED SLEEP (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI), ACTIGRAPHY-ASSESSED SLEEP EFFICIENCY (SE)) AND DEPRESSION (CENTERS FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES DEPRESSION SCALE; CES-D) FOR WOMEN UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY FOR BREAST CANCER. DATA WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE AND 1-WEEK AND 3-MONTH POST-INTERVENTION. BASELINE PSQI, ACTIGRAPHY-SE, AND CES-D WERE EXAMINED AS MODERATORS OF THE EFFECT OF GROUP ON PSQI, ACTIGRAPHY-SE, AND CES-D 1 WEEK AND 3 MONTHS AFTER TREATMENT. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT BASELINE ACTIGRAPHY-SE X GROUP EFFECT ON PSQI AT 1 WEEK (P < .001) AND 3 MONTHS (P = .002) AND ON CES-D AT 3 MONTHS (P = .049). SPECIFICALLY, THE NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION OF BASELINE ACTIGRAPHY-SE WITH SUBSEQUENT PSQI AND CES-D WAS BUFFERED FOR WOMEN IN THE TYP AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT IN STP, COMPARED TO THOSE IN THE UC. BASELINE PSQI AND CES-D WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT MODERATORS OF THE EFFECT OF GROUP ON ANY OUTCOME. BEHAVIORALLY ASSESSED SLEEP MAY BE A MORE ROBUST INDICATOR OF WHICH PATIENTS ARE MOST APPROPRIATE FOR A YOGA INTERVENTION THAN SELF-REPORTED SLEEP QUALITY. WOMEN WITH POOR SLEEP EFFICIENCY MAY DERIVE THE GREATEST BENEFIT IN TERMS OF SLEEP QUALITY AND MOOD FROM A YOGA INTERVENTION.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
10 1650  44 MULTICENTER, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA FOR SLEEP QUALITY AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS. PURPOSE: THIRTY PERCENT TO 90% OF CANCER SURVIVORS REPORT IMPAIRED SLEEP QUALITY POST-TREATMENT, WHICH CAN BE SEVERE ENOUGH TO INCREASE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS EXERCISE, ARE RECOMMENDED IN CONJUNCTION WITH DRUGS AND COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF IMPAIRED SLEEP. PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT YOGA-A MIND-BODY PRACTICE AND FORM OF EXERCISE-MAY IMPROVE SLEEP AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS. THE PRIMARY AIM OF THIS RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF A STANDARDIZED YOGA INTERVENTION COMPARED WITH STANDARD CARE FOR IMPROVING GLOBAL SLEEP QUALITY (PRIMARY OUTCOME) AMONG POST-TREATMENT CANCER SURVIVORS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: IN ALL, 410 SURVIVORS SUFFERING FROM MODERATE OR GREATER SLEEP DISRUPTION BETWEEN 2 AND 24 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY, CHEMOTHERAPY, AND/OR RADIATION THERAPY WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO STANDARD CARE OR STANDARD CARE PLUS THE 4-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. THE YOGA INTERVENTION USED THE YOGA FOR CANCER SURVIVORS (YOCAS) PROGRAM CONSISTING OF PRANAYAMA (BREATHING EXERCISES), 16 GENTLE HATHA AND RESTORATIVE YOGA ASANAS (POSTURES), AND MEDITATION. PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED TWO 75-MINUTE SESSIONS PER WEEK. SLEEP QUALITY WAS ASSESSED BY USING THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX AND ACTIGRAPHY PRE- AND POSTINTERVENTION. RESULTS: IN ALL, 410 SURVIVORS WERE ACCRUED (96% FEMALE; MEAN AGE, 54 YEARS; 75% HAD BREAST CANCER). YOGA PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN GLOBAL SLEEP QUALITY AND, SECONDARILY, SUBJECTIVE SLEEP QUALITY, DAYTIME DYSFUNCTION, WAKE AFTER SLEEP ONSET, SLEEP EFFICIENCY, AND MEDICATION USE AT POSTINTERVENTION (ALL P </= .05) COMPARED WITH STANDARD CARE PARTICIPANTS. CONCLUSION: YOGA, SPECIFICALLY THE YOCAS PROGRAM, IS A USEFUL TREATMENT FOR IMPROVING SLEEP QUALITY AND REDUCING SLEEP MEDICATION USE AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
11 2031  42 TAILORED INDIVIDUAL YOGA PRACTICE IMPROVES SLEEP QUALITY, FATIGUE, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION IN CHRONIC INSOMNIA DISORDER. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC INSOMNIA DISORDER (CI) IS A PREVALENT SLEEP DISORDER THAT CAN LEAD TO DISTURBED DAYTIME FUNCTIONING AND IS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. FIRST-CHOICE TREATMENT IS COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT-I). OTHER MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS TAI-CHI AND YOGA, HAVE DEMONSTRATED SUBJECTIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN SLEEP QUALITY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR IMPROVEMENT OF SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE SLEEP QUALITY AS WELL AS MEASURES OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, SLEEPINESS, AND FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH CI. METHODS: ADULTS WITH CI WERE PROSPECTIVELY INCLUDED IN THIS SINGLE GROUP PRE-POST STUDY. BASELINE ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED HOME POLYSOMNOGRAPHY (PSG), 7-DAY ACTIGRAPHY, AND QUESTIONNAIRES (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX QUESTIONNAIRE (PSQI), HOSPITAL ANXIETY DEPRESSION SCALE (HADS), EPWORTH SLEEPINESS SCALE (ESS), PICHOT FATIGUE SCALE (PS)). PATIENTS PRACTICED VINIYOGA, AN INDIVIDUALISED YOGA PRACTICE WITH DAILY SELF-ADMINISTERED EXERCISES, FOR 14 WEEKS. ASSESSMENTS WERE REPEATED AT THE END OF YOGA PRACTICE. RESULTS: TWENTY-ONE PATIENTS COMPLETED THE STUDY. OBJECTIVE SLEEP MEASUREMENTS REVEALED NO CHANGE IN PSG PARAMETERS AFTER YOGA PRACTICE, BUT A DECREASE IN AROUSALS ON ACTIGRAPHY (P < 0.001). SUBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS IMPROVED FOR ALL QUESTIONNAIRES (PSQI, P < 0.001; HAD-A, P = 0.020, HAD-D, P = 0.001, ESS, P = 0.041, PS, P = 0.010). IN UNIVARIATE CORRELATIONS, DECREASE IN PSQI WAS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASE IN SLEEP STAGE N3 (P < 0.001) ON PSG. CONCLUSIONS: WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED A POSITIVE IMPACT OF INDIVIDUALIZED YOGA PRACTICE ON SUBJECTIVE PARAMETERS RELATED TO SLEEP AND DAYTIME SYMPTOMS IN CI, RESULTING IN FEWER AROUSALS ON ACTIGRAPHY. YOGA COULD BE PROPOSED AS A POTENTIALLY USEFUL ALTERNATIVE TO CBT-I IN CI, AS IT IS EASY TO PRACTICE AUTONOMOUSLY OVER THE LONG-TERM. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE DESIGN OF THE PRESENT STUDY, FUTURE PROSPECTIVE CONTROLLED STUDIES SHOULD FIRST CONFIRM OUR RESULTS.

12 1505  34 IREST YOGA-NIDRA ON THE COLLEGE CAMPUS: CHANGES IN STRESS, DEPRESSION, WORRY, AND MINDFULNESS. OBJECTIVES: THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT YOGA PRACTICE IS ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED STRESS, WORRY, AND DEPRESSION, AND WITH IMPROVED MINDFULNESS-BASED SKILLS. THESE FINDINGS HAD NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY REPLICATED FOR A SAMPLE OF COLLEGE STUDENTS. THIS STUDY EVALUATED WHETHER IREST YOGA-NIDRA PRACTICE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED PERCEIVED STRESS, WORRY, AND DEPRESSION, AND INCREASED MINDFULNESS IN A SAMPLE OF COLLEGE STUDENT S. METHODS: SIXTY-SIX STUDENTS AGE 18-56 COMPLETED AN 8-WEEK IREST YOGA-NIDRA INTERVENTION THAT WAS OFFERED FOR 8 SEMESTERS. ASSESSMENT OCCURRED 1 WEEK PRIOR TO INTERVENTION ONSET AND DURING THE CLASS PERIOD FOLLOWING THE INTERVENTION. QUALITATIVE DATA WERE COLLECTED AT WEEKS 4 AND 8. RESULTS: STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT PRE- TO POSTTEST IMPROVEMENTS IN PERCEIVED STRESS, WORRY, AND DEPRESSION WERE FOUND. PRE-EXISTING DEPRESSION ACCOUNTED FOR MOST OF THE CHANGE IN WORRY AND PERCEIVED STRESS SCORES. PRE- TO POST TEST IMPROVEMENTS IN MINDFULNESS-BASED SKILLS WERE ALSO DETECTED. CONCLUSIONS: IREST YOGA-NIDRA PRACTICE MAY REDUCE SYMPTOMS OF PERCEIVED STRESS, WORRY, AND DEPRESSION AND INCREASE MINDFULNESS-BASED SKILLS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
13 2303  31 TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA ON PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME. BACKGROUND: EIGHTY PERCENT OF WOMEN DURING THEIR REPRODUCTIVE AGE EXPERIENCE SOME SYMPTOMS ATTRIBUTED TO PREMENSTRUAL PHASE OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE. PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME (PMS) IS CHARACTERIZED BY EMOTIONAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS THAT OCCUR DURING LATE LUTEAL PHASE OF MENSTRUAL CYCLE AND ARE RELIEVED AFTER THE ONSET OF MENSTRUATION. AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA ARE ONE OF THE WAYS TO REDUCE THESE SYMPTOMS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA ON PMS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 72 PARTICIPANTS OF PMS, REFERRED FOR PHYSIOTHERAPY TREATMENT (MEAN AGE 28 YEARS), WERE ENROLLED AND ALLOCATED INTO TWO GROUPS (GROUP A AND B) BY SIMPLE COMPUTERIZED RANDOMIZATION. PATIENTS IN GROUP A RECEIVED AEROBIC EXERCISE AND IN GROUP B RECEIVED YOGA MOVEMENTS FOR 40 MIN, 3 TIMES A WEEK FOR 1 MONTH. THE PAIN INTENSITY (VISUAL ANALOG SCALE) AND PMS SCALE WERE MEASURED BEFORE, AT THE END OF 15 DAYS, AND 1 MONTH OF TREATMENT PROGRAM. RESULTS: DATA WERE ANALYZED BY PAIRED T-TEST, UNPAIRED T-TEST, AND ONE-WAY ANOVA; AND THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT BOTH AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA MOVEMENTS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED PAIN INTENSITY AND PMS SYMPTOMS. SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PMS SYMPTOMS WAS FOUND IN PATIENTS TREATED WITH YOGA COMPARED TO AEROBIC EXERCISE; HOWEVER, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND IN PAIN INTENSITY BETWEEN THESE TWO GROUPS (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: IT IS CONCLUDED THAT BOTH AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA MOVEMENTS ARE EFFECTIVE IN TREATING PMS; HOWEVER, YOGA IS MORE EFFECTIVE IN RELIEVING THE SYMPTOMS OF PMS THAN AEROBIC EXERCISE.	2019

BACKGROUND: THE CURRENT RANDOMIZED TRIAL EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF A TIBETAN YOGA PROGRAM (TYP) VERSUS A STRETCHING PROGRAM (STP) AND USUAL CARE (UC) ON SLEEP AND FATIGUE IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER WHO WERE UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY. METHODS: WOMEN WITH STAGE (AMERICAN JOINT COMMITTEE ON CANCER (AJCC) TNM) I TO III BREAST CANCER WHO WERE UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY WERE RANDOMIZED TO TYP (74 WOMEN), STP (68 WOMEN), OR UC (85 WOMEN). PARTICIPANTS IN THE TYP AND STP GROUPS PARTICIPATED IN 4 SESSIONS DURING CHEMOTHERAPY, FOLLOWED BY 3 BOOSTER SESSIONS OVER THE SUBSEQUENT 6 MONTHS, AND WERE ENCOURAGED TO PRACTICE AT HOME. SELF-REPORT MEASURES OF SLEEP DISTURBANCES (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX), FATIGUE (BRIEF FATIGUE INVENTORY), AND ACTIGRAPHY WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE; 1 WEEK AFTER TREATMENT; AND AT 3, 6, AND 12 MONTHS. RESULTS: THERE WERE NO GROUP DIFFERENCES NOTED IN TOTAL SLEEP DISTURBANCES OR FATIGUE LEVELS OVER TIME. HOWEVER, PATIENTS IN THE TYP GROUP REPORTED FEWER DAILY DISTURBANCES 1 WEEK AFTER TREATMENT COMPARED WITH THOSE IN THE STP (DIFFERENCE, -0.43; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [95% CI], -0.82 TO -0.04 [P = .03]) AND UC (DIFFERENCE, -0.41; 95% CI, -0.77 TO -0.05 [P = .02]) GROUPS. GROUP DIFFERENCES AT THE OTHER TIME POINTS WERE MAINTAINED FOR TYP VERSUS STP. ACTIGRAPHY DATA REVEALED GREATER MINUTES AWAKE AFTER SLEEP ONSET FOR PATIENTS IN THE STP GROUP 1 WEEK AFTER TREATMENT VERSUS THOSE IN THE TYP (DIFFERENCE, 15.36; 95% CI, 7.25-23.48 [P = .0003]) AND UC (DIFFERENCE, 14.48; 95% CI, 7.09-21.87 [P = .0002]) GROUPS. PATIENTS IN THE TYP GROUP WHO PRACTICED AT LEAST 2 TIMES A WEEK DURING FOLLOW-UP REPORTED BETTER PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX AND ACTIGRAPHY OUTCOMES AT 3 MONTHS AND 6 MONTHS AFTER TREATMENT COMPARED WITH THOSE WHO DID NOT AND BETTER OUTCOMES COMPARED WITH THOSE IN THE UC GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: PARTICIPATING IN TYP DURING CHEMOTHERAPY RESULTED IN MODEST SHORT-TERM BENEFITS IN SLEEP QUALITY, WITH LONG-TERM BENEFITS EMERGING OVER TIME FOR THOSE WHO PRACTICED TYP AT LEAST 2 TIMES A WEEK.

15 1274  32 FUNCTIONAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF YOGA IN WOMEN WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS: A PILOT STUDY. CONTEXT: STRESS, BOTH PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL, HAS BEEN IMPLICATED AS HAVING A ROLE IN THE ONSET AND EXACERBATIONS OF RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA). OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED WHETHER NEUROENDOCRINE AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION IN WOMEN WITH RA CAN BE ALTERED THROUGH A YOGA INTERVENTION. DESIGN: EXERCISE INTERVENTION. SETTING: UNIVERSITY RESEARCH CONDUCTED AT A MEDICAL CLINIC. PARTICIPANTS: SIXTEEN INDEPENDENTLY LIVING, POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WITH AN RA CLASSIFICATION OF I, II, OR III ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RHEUMATOLOGY FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM SERVED AS EITHER PARTICIPANTS OR CONTROLS. INTERVENTION: THE STUDY GROUP PARTICIPATED IN THREE 75-MINUTE YOGA CLASSES A WEEK OVER A 10-WEEK PERIOD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: AT BASELINE AND ON COMPLETION OF THE 10-WEEK INTERVENTION, DIURNAL CORTISOL PATTERNS AND RESTING HEART RATE WERE MEASURED. BALANCE WAS MEASURED USING THE BERG BALANCE TEST. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE HEALTH ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRE (HIQ), A VISUAL ANALOG PAIN SCALE, AND THE BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY. RESULTS: YOGA RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED HAQ DISABILITY INDEX, DECREASED PERCEPTION OF PAIN AND DEPRESSION, AND IMPROVED BALANCE. YOGA DID NOT RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN AWAKENING OR DIURNAL CORTISOL PATTERNS (P = .12).	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
16 2651  32 YOGA IMPROVES BALANCE, MOBILITY, AND PERCEIVED OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE IN ADULTS WITH CHRONIC BRAIN INJURY: A PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: THIS WAS A PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION TO INVESTIGATE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF GROUP YOGA, AS PAST WORK HAS INDICATED THAT ONE-ON-ONE YOGA CAN IMPROVE FUNCTIONAL DEFICITS IN ADULTS WITH BRAIN INJURY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PARTICIPANTS SERVED AS THEIR OWN CONTROLS. NINE PARTICIPANTS WITH CHRONIC BRAIN INJURY WERE RECRUITED, AND SEVEN (FOUR FEMALE) COMPLETED THE STUDY. PERFORMANCE MEASURES OF BALANCE AND MOBILITY AND SELF-REPORTED MEASURES OF BALANCE CONFIDENCE, PAIN, AND OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE AND SATISFACTION WERE USED. DATA WERE COLLECTED 3 TIMES: BASELINE (STUDY ONSET), PRE-YOGA (AFTER AN 8-WEEK NO-CONTACT PERIOD), AND POST-YOGA (AFTER 8 WEEKS OF YOGA). GROUP YOGA WAS LED BY A YOGA INSTRUCTOR/OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST, AND SESSIONS LASTED 1 H AND OCCURRED TWICE A WEEK. RESULTS: NO PARTICIPANTS WITHDREW DUE TO ADVERSE EFFECTS FROM YOGA. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES BETWEEN BASELINE AND PRE-YOGA. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT WAS OBSERVED POST-YOGA IN BALANCE (P = 0.05), MOBILITY (P = 0.03), AND SELF-REPORTED OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: WE OBSERVED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN BALANCE, MOBILITY, AND SELF-REPORTED OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE IN ADULTS WITH CHRONIC BRAIN INJURY.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
17 2521  41 YOGA DECREASES INSOMNIA IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN: A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: THE PRACTICE OF YOGA HAS BEEN PROVEN TO HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON REDUCING INSOMNIA. STUDIES HAVE ALSO SHOWN ITS EFFECTS ON REDUCING CLIMACTERIC SYMPTOMS. TO DATE, HOWEVER, NO STUDIES THAT EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF INSOMNIA IN A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICE ON THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH AND CLIMACTERIC SYMPTOMS OF POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF INSOMNIA. METHODS: POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN NOT UNDERGOING HORMONE THERAPY, WHO WERE 50 TO 65 YEARS OLD, WHO HAD AN APNEA-HYPOPNEA INDEX LESS THAN 15, AND WHO HAD A DIAGNOSIS OF INSOMNIA WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THREE GROUPS, AS FOLLOWS: CONTROL, PASSIVE STRETCHING, AND YOGA. QUESTIONNAIRES WERE ADMINISTERED BEFORE AND 4 MONTHS AFTER THE INTERVENTION TO EVALUATE QUALITY OF LIFE, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS, CLIMACTERIC SYMPTOMS, INSOMNIA SEVERITY, DAYTIME SLEEPINESS, AND STRESS. THE VOLUNTEERS ALSO UNDERWENT POLYSOMNOGRAPHY. THE STUDY LASTED 4 MONTHS. RESULTS: THERE WERE 44 VOLUNTEERS AT THE END OF THE STUDY. WHEN COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP, THE YOGA GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER POSTTREATMENT SCORES FOR CLIMACTERIC SYMPTOMS AND INSOMNIA SEVERITY AND HIGHER SCORES FOR QUALITY OF LIFE AND RESISTANCE PHASE OF STRESS. THE REDUCTION IN INSOMNIA SEVERITY IN THE YOGA GROUP WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT IN THE CONTROL AND PASSIVE-STRETCHING GROUPS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT A SPECIFIC SEQUENCE OF YOGA MIGHT BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING INSOMNIA AND MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS AS WELL AS IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WITH INSOMNIA.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
18 2822  37 YOGA V. HEALTH EDUCATION FOR ATTENTIONAL PROCESSES RELEVANT TO MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER. OBJECTIVES: RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT FOR PERSISTENT DEPRESSION, THE BENEFITS OF WHICH MAY ACCUMULATE OVER TIME. THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS STUDY WERE TO EVALUATE THE FOLLOWING IN A SAMPLE OF PERSISTENTLY DEPRESSED INDIVIDUALS: WHETHER YOGA INCREASES MINDFULNESS AND WHETHER YOGA ATTENUATES RUMINATION. RUMINATION AND MINDFULNESS BOTH REPRESENT ATTENTIONAL PROCESSES RELEVANT FOR ONSET AND MAINTENANCE OF DEPRESSIVE EPISODES. METHODS: ONE-HUNDRED-TEN INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE PERSISTENTLY DEPRESSED DESPITE ONGOING USE OF PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT WERE RECRUITED INTO AN RCT COMPARING YOGA WITH A HEALTH EDUCATION CLASS. MINDFULNESS AND RUMINATION WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND ACROSS 3 TIME POINTS DURING THE TEN-WEEK INTERVENTION. RESULTS: FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE THAT, COMPARED TO HEALTH EDUCATION, YOGA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER MEAN LEVELS OF THE OBSERVE FACET OF MINDFULNESS RELATIVE TO THE CONTROL GROUP DURING THE INTERVENTION PERIOD (P =.004, D =0.38), AND THAT YOGA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A FASTER RATE OF INCREASE IN LEVELS OF ACTING WITH AWARENESS OVER THE INTERVENTION PERIOD (P= .03, F(2) =0.027). THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INTERVENTION GROUPS WITH RESPECT TO RUMINATION. CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS SUGGEST A SMALL EFFECT OF YOGA ON COMPONENTS OF MINDFULNESS DURING A 10-WEEK INTERVENTION PERIOD. PREVIOUS RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT CONTINUED ASSESSMENT AFTER THE INITIAL 10 WEEKS MAY REVEAL CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT. FUTURE RESEARCH MAY ALSO EXAMINE MODERATORS OF THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON MINDFULNESS AND RUMINATION, INCLUDING CLINICAL FACTORS SUCH AS DEPRESSION SEVERITY OR DEPRESSION CHRONICITY, OR DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS SUCH AS AGE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
19 1375  40 IMPACT OF DAILY YOGA-BASED EXERCISE ON PAIN, CATASTROPHIZING, AND SLEEP AMONGST INDIVIDUALS WITH FIBROMYALGIA. BACKGROUND: FIBROMYALGIA (FM) IS A CHRONIC WIDESPREAD PAIN DISORDER CHARACTERIZED BY NEGATIVE AFFECT, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, AND FATIGUE. THIS UNCONTROLLED PILOT STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFICACY OF DAILY YOGA-BASED EXERCISE TO IMPROVE FM SYMPTOMS AND EXPLORED BASELINE PHENOTYPIC CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH THE GREATEST BENEFIT. METHODS: FM PATIENTS (N=46, WITH 36 COMPLETERS) REPORTED PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING AND A RANGE OF FM SYMPTOMS USING VALIDATED INSTRUMENTS BEFORE AND AFTER PARTICIPATION IN SATYANANDA YOGA, WHICH INCLUDED WEEKLY IN-PERSON PAIN-TAILORED GROUP CLASSES FOR 6 WEEKS AND DAILY HOME YOGA VIDEO PRACTICE. RESULTS: CHANGES IN FM SYMPTOMS FROM PRE- TO POST-YOGA WERE VARIABLE AMONGST PARTICIPANTS. GROUP MEANS FOR PAIN DECREASED, AS REPORTED BY AVERAGE DAILY DIARY AND BRIEF PAIN INVENTORY, WITH GREATER HOME PRACTICE MINUTES ASSOCIATED WITH A GREATER DECREASE IN PAIN. AVERAGE DAILY RATINGS OF SLEEP AND FATIGUE IMPROVED. PAIN CATASTROPHIZING WAS DECREASED OVERALL, WITH GREATER CHANGE CORRELATED TO A DECREASE IN FM SYMPTOMS. WE DID NOT OBSERVE ANY GROUP MEAN CHANGES IN ACTIGRAPHY SLEEP EFFICIENCY, PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES MEASUREMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM-ANXIETY AND THE REVISED FIBROMYALGIA IMPACT QUESTIONNAIRE. MULTILEVEL MODELING ANALYSIS REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION BETWEEN ANXIETY AND CATASTROPHIZING FOR END-STUDY SLEEP EFFICIENCY, FATIGUE, AND PAIN, SUCH THAT PATIENTS WITH HIGHER BASELINE CATASTROPHIZING AND LOWER BASELINE ANXIETY REPORTED LESS PAIN AND FATIGUE, AND HIGHER SLEEP EFFICIENCY AFTER THE SIXTH WEEK OF YOGA PRACTICE. CONCLUSION: THIS PILOT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT YOGA MAY REDUCE PAIN AND CATASTROPHIZING, AS WELL AS IMPROVE SLEEP, BUT THESE CHANGES WERE MODEST ACROSS STUDY PARTICIPANTS. GREATER UPTAKE OF HOME YOGA PRACTICE AS WELL AS A PHENOTYPE OF HIGHER BASELINE CATASTROPHIZING COMBINED WITH LOWER BASELINE ANXIETY WERE ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER IMPACT. FUTURE RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIALS COMPARING DIFFERENT TYPES OF YOGA OR EXERCISE WILL ALLOW DETERMINATION OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS FOR FM AND ALLOW CLOSER TARGETING TO THE PATIENTS WHO WILL BENEFIT MOST FROM THEM.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                       
20 2038  33 TELOMERASE ACTIVITY AND CELLULAR AGING MIGHT BE POSITIVELY MODIFIED BY A YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION. OBJECTIVES: RECENT STUDIES SHOWED THAT A BRIEF YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION WAS EFFICACIOUS IN REDUCING LEVELS OF OXIDATIVE STRESS AND CELLULAR AGING IN OBESE MEN. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS CASE REPORT WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF THIS INTERVENTION IN REDUCING THE LEVELS OF BIOCHEMICAL MARKERS OF CELLULAR AGEING, OXIDATIVE STRESS, AND INFLAMMATION AT BASELINE (DAY 0), AT THE END OF ACTIVE INTERVENTION (DAY 10), AND FOLLOW-UP AT DAY 90. DESIGN: SINGLE CASE REPORT FROM A PROSPECTIVE ONGOING STUDY WITH PRE-POST DESIGN ASSESSING THE LEVEL OF VARIOUS MARKERS OF CELLULAR AGING. SETTING: INTEGRAL HEALTH CLINIC, AN OUTPATIENT FACILITY CONDUCTING MEDITATION AND YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION PROGRAMS FOR MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC DISEASES. PATIENT: A 31-YEAR-OLD MAN WITH CLASS I OBESITY (BODY-MASS INDEX, 29.5 KG/M(2)) WHO PRESENTED TO THE MEDICINE OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENT AT ALL INDIA INSTITUTE OF MEDICAL SCIENCES, NEW DELHI, INDIA, WITH A HISTORY OF FATIGUE, DIFFICULTY LOSING WEIGHT, AND LACK OF MOTIVATION. HE NOTED A MARKED DECREASE IN HIS ENERGY LEVEL, PARTICULARLY IN THE AFTERNOON. INTERVENTION: A PRETESTED INTERVENTION PROGRAM INCLUDED ASANAS (POSTURES), PRANAYAMA (BREATHING EXERCISES), STRESS MANAGEMENT, GROUP DISCUSSIONS, LECTURES, AND INDIVIDUALIZED ADVICE. RESULTS: FROM BASELINE (DAY 0) TO DAY 90, THE ACTIVITY OF TELOMERASE AND LEVELS OF BETA-ENDORPHINS, PLASMA CORTISOL, AND INTERLEUKIN-6 INCREASED, AND A SUSTAINED REDUCTION IN OXIDATIVE STRESS MARKERS, SUCH AS REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES AND 8-HYDROXY-2-DEOXY-GUANOSINE LEVELS. CONCLUSIONS: ADOPTING YOGA/MEDITATION-BASED LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION CAUSES REVERSAL OF MARKERS OF AGING, MAINLY OXIDATIVE STRESS, TELOMERASE ACTIVITY, AND OXIDATIVE DNA DAMAGE. THIS MAY NOT ONLY DELAY AGING AND PROLONG A YOUTHFUL HEALTHY LIFE BUT ALSO DELAY OR PREVENT ONSET OF SEVERAL LIFESTYLE-RELATED DISEASES, OF WHICH OXIDATIVE STRESS AND INFLAMMATION ARE THE CHIEF CAUSE. THIS REPORT SUGGESTS THIS SIMPLE LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION MAY BE THERAPEUTIC FOR OXIDATIVE DNA DAMAGE AND OXIDATIVE STRESS.	2015

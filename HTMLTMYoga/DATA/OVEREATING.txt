1 1492 159 INTERNALIZED WEIGHT STIGMA AND INTUITIVE EATING AMONG STRESSED ADULTS DURING A MINDFUL YOGA INTERVENTION: ASSOCIATIONS WITH CHANGES IN MINDFULNESS AND SELF-COMPASSION. PURPOSE: INTERNALIZED WEIGHT STIGMA (IWS) IS COMMON IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ACROSS BODY WEIGHT CATEGORIES, AND IS IMPLICATED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DISTRESS AND UNHEALTHY EATING BEHAVIORS (E.G. OVEREATING, DISORDERED EATING) THAT CAN FOSTER POOR CARDIOMETABOLIC HEALTH. WHILE EMERGING INTERVENTION RESEARCH SHOWS EARLY PROMISE IN REDUCING IWS, LONG-TERM EFFICACY IS UNCLEAR AND NOVEL STRATEGIES REMAIN NEEDED. THIS ANALYSIS EXAMINED WHETHER PARTICIPATION IN A MINDFUL YOGA INTERVENTION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED IWS AND INCREASED INTUITIVE EATING, AN ADAPTIVE EATING BEHAVIOR, AND WHETHER THESE CHANGES CORRELATED WITH EACH OTHER OR WITH CHANGES IN MINDFULNESS AND SELF-COMPASSION. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE STRESSED ADULTS WITH LOW FRUIT AND VEGETABLE INTAKE (N = 78, 64.1% WHITE, M. BODY MASS INDEX 25.59 +/- 4.45) ENROLLED IN A PARENT CLINICAL TRIAL OF A 12-WEEK MINDFUL YOGA INTERVENTION. VALIDATED SELF-REPORT MEASURES OF IWS, INTUITIVE EATING, MINDFULNESS, AND SELF-COMPASSION WERE ADMINISTERED AT PRE-TREATMENT, MID-TREATMENT (8 WEEKS), POST-TREATMENT (12 WEEKS), AND 4-MONTH FOLLOW-UP (24 WEEKS). RESULTS: LINEAR MIXED MODELING REVEALED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN IWS AND INTUITIVE EATING ACROSS THE FOUR TIMEPOINTS (P < .001). REDUCED IWS CORRELATED WITH INCREASED INTUITIVE EATING PRE- TO POST-TREATMENT (P = .01). IMPROVED SELF-COMPASSION AND MINDFULNESS CORRELATED WITH INTUITIVE EATING (BOTH P = . 04), BUT NOT IWS (P = .74 AND P = .56, RESPECTIVELY). CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY OFFERS PRELIMINARY SUPPORT FOR THE HYPOTHESIS THAT MINDFUL YOGA MAY PROMOTE INTUITIVE EATING AND REDUCE IWS AMONG STRESSED ADULTS WITH POOR DIET, AND SUGGESTS THAT CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS MAY CO-OCCUR OVER TIME. FURTHER INVESTIGATION WITH CONTROLLED DESIGNS IS NECESSARY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE TEMPORALITY AND CAUSALITY OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS.TRIAL REGISTRATION: CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT02098018.	2021	

2 2133  35 THE EFFECTS OF A HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION ON FACETS OF DISTRESS TOLERANCE. INDIVIDUALS WITH LOW DISTRESS TOLERANCE (DT) EXPERIENCE NEGATIVE EMOTION AS PARTICULARLY THREATENING AND ARE HIGHLY MOTIVATED TO REDUCE OR AVOID SUCH AFFECTIVE EXPERIENCES. CONSEQUENTLY, THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE DIFFICULTY REGULATING EMOTIONS AND TEND TO ENGAGE IN MALADAPTIVE STRATEGIES, SUCH AS OVEREATING, AS A MEANS TO REDUCE OR AVOID DISTRESS. HATHA YOGA ENCOURAGES ONE TO IMPLEMENT PRESENT-CENTERED AWARENESS AND NON-REACTION IN THE FACE OF PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISCOMFORT AND, THUS, EMERGES AS A POTENTIAL STRATEGY FOR INCREASING DT. TO TEST WHETHER A HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION CAN ENHANCE DT, A TRANSDIAGNOSTIC RISK AND MAINTENANCE FACTOR, THIS STUDY RANDOMLY ASSIGNED FEMALES HIGH IN EMOTIONAL EATING IN RESPONSE TO STRESS (N = 52) EITHER TO AN 8-WEEK, TWICE-WEEKLY HATHA (BIKRAM) YOGA INTERVENTION OR TO A WAITLIST CONTROL CONDITION. SELF-REPORTED DT AND EMOTIONAL EATING WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE, WEEKLY DURING TREATMENT, AND 1-WEEK POST-TREATMENT. CONSISTENT WITH PREDICTION, PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA CONDITION REPORTED GREATER INCREASES IN DT OVER THE COURSE OF THE INTERVENTION RELATIVE TO WAITLIST PARTICIPANTS (COHEN'S D = .82). ALSO CONSISTENT WITH PREDICTION, THE REDUCTION IN EMOTIONAL EATING WAS GREATER FOR THE YOGA CONDITION THAN THE WAITLIST CONDITION (COHEN'S D = .92). IMPORTANTLY, REDUCTIONS DISTRESS ABSORPTION, A SPECIFIC SUB-FACET OF DT, ACCOUNTED FOR 15% OF THE VARIANCE IN EMOTIONAL EATING, A HALLMARK BEHAVIOR OF EATING PATHOLOGY AND RISK FACTOR FOR OBESITY.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
3   15  28 "OVEREATING IS NOT ABOUT THE FOOD": WOMEN DESCRIBE THEIR EXPERIENCE OF A YOGA TREATMENT PROGRAM FOR BINGE EATING. AS PART OF A LARGER MIXED-METHODS STUDY, DATA FROM 20 PERSONAL JOURNALS WERE ANALYZED TO EXAMINE THE EXPERIENCE OF A 12-WEEK YOGA TREATMENT PROGRAM FOR BINGE EATING AMONG A SAMPLE OF 25 WOMEN WHO WERE OBESE. QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS REVEALED A POSITIVE SHIFT EXPERIENCED BY THE WOMEN DURING THE PROGRAM, SUMMARIZED BY A GENERAL STRUCTURAL DESCRIPTION: DISCONNECTION VERSUS CONNECTION. WOMEN'S COMMENTS SUGGESTED THAT THE PROGRAM APPEARED TO ENCOURAGE A HEALTHY RECONNECTION TO FOOD, AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF PHYSICAL SELF-EMPOWERMENT, THROUGH CULTIVATING PRESENT-MOMENT AWARENESS. SPECIFICALLY, WOMEN PERCEIVED AN OVERALL REDUCTION IN THE QUANTITY OF FOOD THEY CONSUMED, DECREASED EATING SPEED, AND AN IMPROVEMENT IN FOOD CHOICES THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAM. THE WOMEN ALSO REPORTED FEELING MORE CONNECTED TO AND POSITIVE ABOUT THEIR PHYSICAL WELL-BEING. THESE EVOLVING OUTCOMES WERE SUMMARIZED THROUGH TWO MAJOR THEMES: THE WAY THEIR PHYSICALITY CHANGED, AND THE WAY THEIR FOOD CONSUMPTION CHANGED OVER TIME. FINDINGS PROVIDE INSIGHTS RELEVANT TO THERAPEUTIC PROCESSES THAT MIGHT OCCUR WITHIN EATING DISORDER INTERVENTIONS THAT DRAW ON MEDITATION-BASED APPROACHES.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
4 2734  60 YOGA PARTICIPATION ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN DIETARY PATTERNS AND STRESS: A PILOT STUDY IN STRESSED ADULTS WITH POOR DIET. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: STRESS CONTRIBUTES TO DIETARY PATTERNS THAT IMPEDE HEALTH. YOGA IS AN INTEGRATIVE STRESS MANAGEMENT APPROACH ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED DIETARY PATTERNS IN BURGEONING RESEARCH. YET, NO RESEARCH HAS EXAMINED CHANGE IN DIETARY PATTERNS, BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), AND STRESS DURING A YOGA INTERVENTION AMONG STRESSED ADULTS WITH POOR DIET. MATERIALS AND METHODS: OBJECTIVELY-MEASURED BMI AND A BATTERY OF SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES WERE COLLECTED AT FOUR TIME POINTS DURING AND FOLLOWING A 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION (N = 78, 71% WOMEN, MEAN BMI = 25.69 KG/M(2)+/-4.59) - PRE-TREATMENT (T1), MID-TREATMENT (6 WEEKS; T2), POST-TREATMENT (12 WEEKS; T3), AND AT 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP (24 WEEKS; T4). RESULTS: T1 TO T3 FRUIT AND VEGETABLE INTAKE, BMI, AND STRESS SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINED IN THE OVERALL SAMPLE. REDUCTION IN VEGETABLE INTAKE WAS NO LONGER SIGNIFICANT AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR REDUCTIONS IN CALORIC INTAKE, AND REDUCTION IN CALORIC INTAKE REMAINED SIGNIFICANT AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR REDUCTIONS IN STRESS. CONCLUSION: FINDINGS MAY BE INTERPRETED AS YOGA EITHER ENCOURAGING OR ADVERSELY IMPACTING HEALTHY DIETARY PATTERNS (I.E., MINIMIZING LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE WEIGHT GAIN VS. DECREASING VEGETABLE INTAKE AND OVERALL CALORIC INTAKE AMONG INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY NOT NEED TO LOSE WEIGHT, RESPECTIVELY). CONTINUED RESEARCH IS WARRANTED, UTILIZING CAUSAL DESIGNS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
5  391  36 BENEFITS OF YOGA IN THE TREATMENT OF EATING DISORDERS: RESULTS OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. YOGA HAS BEGUN TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE TREATMENT OF EATING DISORDERS DESPITE LIMITED EMPIRICAL SUPPORT FOR THIS PRACTICE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFICACY OF INCORPORATING YOGA INTO THE TREATMENT OF EATING DISORDERS. THIS PRELIMINARY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL INVESTIGATED THE BENEFITS OF PARTICIPATING IN AN EIGHT-WEEK KRIPALU YOGA PROGRAM FOR 53 WOMEN WITH SYMPTOMS OF BULIMIA NERVOSA AND BINGE EATING DISORDER. COMPARED TO WAITLIST CONTROLS, YOGA PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCED DECREASES IN BINGE EATING FREQUENCY, EMOTIONAL REGULATION DIFFICULTIES AND SELF-CRITICISM, AND INCREASES IN SELF-COMPASSION. YOGA PARTICIPANTS ALSO EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN STATE MINDFULNESS SKILLS ACROSS THE EIGHT WEEKS OF THE YOGA PROGRAM. WHILE THESE RESULTS ARE ENCOURAGING AND SUGGEST YOGA MAY HAVE A VALUABLE ROLE TO PLAY IN THE TREATMENT OF EATING DISORDERS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO STRESS THEIR TENTATIVE NATURE. FURTHER RESEARCH, ADOPTING A MORE RIGOROUS DESIGN, IS NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE LIMITATIONS OF THE PRESENT STUDY AND EXPAND ON THESE FINDINGS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
6   19  42 "WE REALLY NEED THIS": TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA FOR VETERAN WOMEN WITH A HISTORY OF MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA. OBJECTIVES: UP TO 70% OF WOMEN SERVICE MEMBERS IN THE UNITED STATES REPORT MILITARY SEXUAL TRAUMA (MST); MANY DEVELOP POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) AND CO-OCCURRING DISORDERS. TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA (TIY) IS SUGGESTED TO IMPROVE PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS AND SHOWN FEASIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE IN EMERGING RESEARCH, YET NO WORK HAS EVALUATED TIY IN MST SURVIVORS. THE CURRENT QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT AIMED TO EXAMINE TIY'S FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND PERCEIVED EFFECTS IN THE CONTEXT OF MST. DESIGN: COLLECTIVE CASE SERIES (N = 7). SETTING: NEW ENGLAND VET CENTER. INTERVENTIONS: EXTANT TIY PROGRAM (MINDFUL YOGA THERAPY) ADAPTED FOR VETERAN WOMEN WITH MST IN CONCURRENT PSYCHOTHERAPY. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ATTRITION AND ATTENDANCE; QUALITATIVE EXIT INTERVIEW; VALIDATED SELF-REPORT MEASURE OF NEGATIVE AFFECT PRE/POST EACH YOGA CLASS, AND SYMPTOM SEVERITY ASSESSMENTS AND SURVEYS BEFORE (T1; TIME 1) AND AFTER THE YOGA PROGRAM (T2; TIME 2). RESULTS: FEASIBILITY WAS DEMONSTRATED AND WOMEN REPORTED TIY WAS ACCEPTABLE. IN QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS, WOMEN REPORTED IMPROVED SYMPTOM SEVERITY, DIET, EXERCISE, ALCOHOL USE, SLEEP, AND PAIN; REDUCED MEDICATION USE; AND THEMES RELATED TO STRESS REDUCTION, MINDFULNESS, AND SELF-COMPASSION. REGARDING QUANTITATIVE CHANGE, RESULTS SUGGEST ACUTE REDUCTIONS IN NEGATIVE AFFECT FOLLOWING YOGA SESSIONS ACROSS PARTICIPANTS, AS WELL AS IMPROVED AFFECT DYSREGULATION, SHAME, AND MINDFULNESS T1 TO T2. CONCLUSIONS: TIY IS BOTH FEASIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE TO VETERAN WOMEN MST SURVIVORS IN ONE SPECIFIC VET CENTER, WITH PERCEIVED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BENEFITS. RESULTS SUGGEST TIY MAY TARGET PSYCHOSOCIAL MECHANISMS IMPLICATED IN HEALTH BEHAVIOR CHANGE (STRESS REDUCTION, MINDFULNESS, AFFECT REGULATION, SHAME). FORMAL RESEARCH SHOULD BE CONDUCTED TO CONFIRM THESE QI PROJECT RESULTS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                             
7  154  24 A QUALITATIVE STUDY EXPLORING MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN'S EXPERIENCES WITH YOGA. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE HOW YOGA IMPACTS BODY-RELATED THOUGHTS, FEELINGS, PERCEPTIONS AND ATTITUDES, WELL-BEING, AND SELF-CARE BEHAVIORS IN A SAMPLE OF MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN WHO REGULARLY ENGAGE IN YOGA IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. THE SAMPLE INCLUDED 22 WOMEN; 10 SELF-IDENTIFIED AS BEGINNERS OR NOVICES AND 12 SELF-IDENTIFIED AS EXPERIENCED IN YOGA. INTERPRETIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL ANALYSIS GUIDED THE DATA COLLECTION, ANALYSIS, AND INTERPRETATION. FOUR KEY THEMES WERE IDENTIFIED AROUND THE TOPICS OF: SUPPORTIVE YOGA ENVIRONMENT, MINDFULNESS, SELF-CARE BEHAVIORS, AND BODY-RELATED PERCEPTIONS. RESULTS HIGHLIGHT POTENTIAL ELEMENTS OF YOGA THAT CAN SUPPORT POSITIVE BODY-RELATED EXPERIENCES IN MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
8  257  36 A YOGA-BASED THERAPY PROGRAM DESIGNED TO IMPROVE BODY IMAGE AMONG AN OUTPATIENT EATING DISORDERED POPULATION: PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND RESULTS FROM A MIXED-METHODS PILOT STUDY. POOR BODY IMAGE IS A CRITICAL BARRIER TO EATING DISORDER RECOVERY. THIS PILOT PROJECT WAS DESIGNED AS A FEASIBILITY STUDY TO EXAMINE A NOVEL GROUP-BASED, THERAPEUTIC YOGA AND BODY IMAGE PROGRAM (YBI) FOR ADDRESSING NEGATIVE BODY IMAGE IN THOSE CLINICALLY DIAGNOSED WITH AN EATING DISORDER (ANOREXIA, BULIMIA NERVOSA, AND OTHER SPECIFIED FEEDING OR EATING DISORDER) RECEIVING OUTPATIENT LEVEL TREATMENT AT AN EATING DISORDER TREATMENT CENTER LOCATED IN MINNEAPOLIS-ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA. SELF-ADMINISTERED QUESTIONNAIRES WERE COMPLETED BY 67 PARTICIPANTS AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE 8-WEEK SERIES, TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE ACCEPTABILITY OF THE YBI PROGRAM AND ITS POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON BODY IMAGE AND SELF-WORTH DURING OUTPATIENT EATING DISORDER TREATMENT. QUANTITATIVE SURVEY QUESTIONS ASSESSED PARTICIPANTS' BODY IMAGE CONCERNS, WHILE OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS PROBED PARTICIPANTS' EXPERIENCES AND THE PERCEIVED IMPACT OF THE YOGA PROGRAM ON THEIR BODY IMAGE. AFTER COMPLETION OF THE YOGA PROGRAM, MEAN ITEM SCORES ON THE BODY IMAGE CONCERN SURVEY IMPROVED: INCREASES RANGED FROM 0.3 TO 0.8 POINTS ON A 5-POINT SCALE. IN OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS, PARTICIPANTS DESCRIBED MANY POSITIVE CHANGES TO THEIR BODY IMAGE. PARTICIPANTS REPORTED THAT THE YOGA PROGRAM IMPROVED THEIR SELF-ACCEPTANCE, SELF-AWARENESS, CONFIDENCE, EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL STRENGTH, AND WAS A POSITIVE FORM OF RELEASE. PARTICIPANTS ALSO DISCUSSED PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL CHALLENGES OF THE YOGA PROGRAM AND HOW THEY CONTRIBUTED TO SELF-JUDGMENT, VULNERABILITY, AND CONFRONTATION OF UNCOMFORTABLE FEELINGS. THE RESULTS OF THIS PILOT STUDY ARE PROMISING AND WARRANT CONSIDERATION OF MORE RIGOROUS STUDY DESIGNS TO EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL OF A BODY IMAGE SPECIFIC THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM TO AID THOSE IN EATING DISORDER TREATMENT TO IMPROVE BODY IMAGE DISTURBANCES.	2020	
                                                                                 
9  653  20 EATING DISORDERS, EMBODIMENT, AND YOGA: A CONCEPTUAL OVERVIEW. YOGA AND ITS RELATION TO EMBODIMENT AND DISORDERED EATING HAS ONLY RECENTLY RECEIVED RESEARCH ATTENTION. NEVERTHELESS, EARLY RESEARCH INDICATES THAT YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF EATING DISORDERS. IT IS ASSUMED THAT YOGA AMELIORATES EATING DISORDER SYMPTOMS AND FACILITATES A SHIFT FROM NEGATIVE TOWARDS POSITIVE BODY IMAGE AND WELL-BEING BY CULTIVATING POSITIVE EMBODIMENT (I.E., THE ABILITY TO FEEL A SENSE OF CONNECTION BETWEEN MIND AND BODY). IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE CONTEXT OF THE CONSTRUCTS OF DISORDERED EATING, EMBODIMENT, AND YOGA, THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A BRIEF OVERVIEW AND CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THESE CONSTRUCTS. THE THREE MAJOR EATING DISORDERS AND CURRENT TREATMENT METHODS ARE DESCRIBED. FURTHER, THE PHILOSOPHICAL ROOTS AND THEORETICAL MODELS OF EMBODIMENT ARE DELINEATED AND THEIR COMMUNAL CORE FEATURES ARE OUTLINED.

10 1320  44 HEATED HATHA YOGA TO TARGET CORTISOL REACTIVITY TO STRESS AND AFFECTIVE EATING IN WOMEN AT RISK FOR OBESITY-RELATED ILLNESSES: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: CORTISOL REACTIVITY TO STRESS IS ASSOCIATED WITH AFFECTIVE EATING, AN IMPORTANT BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTOR FOR OBESITY AND RELATED METABOLIC DISEASES. YOGA PRACTICE IS RELATED TO DECREASES IN STRESS AND CORTISOL LEVELS, THUS EMERGING AS A POTENTIAL TARGETED COMPLEMENTARY INTERVENTION FOR AFFECTIVE EATING. THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL EXAMINED THE EFFICACY OF A HEATED, HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION FOR REDUCING CORTISOL REACTIVITY TO STRESS AND AFFECTIVE EATING. METHOD: FEMALES (N = 52; AGES 25-46 YEARS; 75% WHITE) AT RISK FOR OBESITY AND RELATED ILLNESSES WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO 8 WEEKS OF BIKRAM YOGA PRACTICE OR TO WAITLIST CONTROL. CORTISOL REACTIVITY TO A LABORATORY STRESS INDUCTION WERE MEASURED AT WEEKS 0 (PRETREATMENT) AND 9 (POSTTREATMENT). SELF-REPORTED BINGE EATING FREQUENCY AND COPING MOTIVES FOR EATING WERE ASSESSED AT WEEKS 0, 3, 6, AND 9. RESULTS: AMONG PARTICIPANTS WITH ELEVATED CORTISOL REACTIVITY AT PRETREATMENT ("HIGH REACTORS"), THOSE RANDOMIZED TO THE YOGA CONDITION EVIDENCED GREATER PRE- TO POSTTREATMENT REDUCTIONS IN CORTISOL REACTIVITY (P = .042, D = .85), BUT THERE WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT CONDITION DIFFERENCES FOR THE "LOW REACTORS" (P = .178, D = .53). YOGA PARTICIPANTS REPORTED GREATER DECREASES IN BINGE EATING FREQUENCY (P = .040, D = .62) AND EATING TO COPE WITH NEGATIVE AFFECT (P = .038, D = .54). CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY PROVIDES PRELIMINARY SUPPORT FOR THE EFFICACY OF HEATED HATHA YOGA FOR TREATING PHYSIOLOGICAL STRESS REACTIVITY AND AFFECTIVE EATING AMONG WOMEN AT RISK FOR OBESITY-RELATED ILLNESSES.

11   18  27 "THE PROGRAM AFFECTS ME 'CAUSE IT GIVES AWAY STRESS": URBAN STUDENTS' QUALITATIVE PERSPECTIVES ON STRESS AND A SCHOOL-BASED MINDFUL YOGA INTERVENTION. CONTEXT: SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA STUDIES GENERALLY MEASURE STRESS-RELATED OUTCOMES USING QUANTITATIVE MEASURES. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY ANSWERS THE FOLLOWING RESEARCH QUESTIONS: HOW DO YOUTH DEFINE STRESS AND IN WHAT WAYS, IF ANY, WAS A MINDFUL YOGA INTERVENTION HELPFUL TO YOUTH DURING STRESS EXPERIENCES? DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: TO EXPLORE YOUTHS' OWN PERSPECTIVES ON STRESS, STRESSORS IN YOUTHS' LIVES, AND PERCEIVED CHANGES IN RESPONSES TO STRESS POST-INTERVENTION, WE CONDUCTED FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS WITH 22 MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS FROM LOW-INCOME URBAN COMMUNITIES FOLLOWING A 16-WEEK MINDFUL YOGA INTERVENTION. RESULTS: USING THEMATIC ANALYSIS, THE FOLLOWING THREE THEMES EMERGED: (1) YOUTH CONFLATED STRESS WITH NEGATIVE EMOTIONS; (2) PEER AND FAMILY CONFLICTS WERE COMMON STRESSORS; AND (3) YOUTH REPORTED IMPROVED IMPULSE CONTROL AND EMOTIONAL REGULATION FOLLOWING THE INTERVENTION. STUDY FINDINGS HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR REFINING INTERVENTION CONTENT (E.G., DISCUSSIONS OF STRESS), AS WELL AS INFORMING THE SELECTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF QUANTITATIVE MEASURES FOR FUTURE RESEARCH ON STRESS AND STRESS RESPONSES IN URBAN YOUTH.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
12 2312  27 TRAUMA SENSITIVE YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER: A QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS. RESEARCH ON POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AND CHRONIC CHILDHOOD ABUSE HAS REVEALED THAT TRADITIONAL TRAUMA TREATMENTS OFTEN FAIL TO FULLY ADDRESS THE COMPLICATED SYMPTOM PRESENTATION, INCLUDING THE SOMATIC COMPLAINTS, LOSS OF AWARENESS OF ONE'S EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL BEING IN THE PRESENT MOMENT, AND OVERALL LACK OF INTEGRATION BETWEEN THE SELF AND THE BODY. THE MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTION OF HATHA YOGA SHOWS PROMISE AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT, AND FOCUSES ON PERSONAL GROWTH IN ADDITION TO SYMPTOM REDUCTION. THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY EXPLORED THE EXPERIENCES OF THIRTY-ONE ADULT WOMEN WITH PTSD RELATED TO CHRONIC CHILDHOOD TRAUMA WHO PARTICIPATED IN A 10-WEEK TRAUMA SENSITIVE YOGA CLASS, SPECIFICALLY EXAMINING PERCEIVED CHANGES IN SYMPTOMS AND PERSONAL GROWTH. FIVE THEMES WERE IDENTIFIED THAT REFLECT PARTICIPANTS' FEELINGS OF GRATITUDE AND COMPASSION, RELATEDNESS, ACCEPTANCE, CENTEREDNESS, AND EMPOWERMENT.

13 2278  37 THE ROLES OF SELF-COMPASSION, BODY SURVEILLANCE, AND BODY APPRECIATION IN PREDICTING INTRINSIC MOTIVATION FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY: CROSS-SECTIONAL ASSOCIATIONS, AND PROSPECTIVE CHANGES WITHIN A YOGA CONTEXT. ENGAGING IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOR THE IMMEDIATE INTERNAL EXPERIENCES IT BRINGS (E.G., PLEASURE, SATISFACTION) IS CRITICAL FOR LONG-TERM EXERCISE ADHERENCE. INVESTIGATIONS OF HOW FACTORS SUCH AS BODY IMAGE CONTRIBUTE TO INTRINSIC MOTIVATION FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ARE NEEDED. THE PRESENT STUDY EXAMINED BODY SURVEILLANCE AND BODY APPRECIATION AS MEDIATORS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SELF-COMPASSION AND INTRINSIC MOTIVATION FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY CROSS-SECTIONALLY AND PROSPECTIVELY. ONE SAMPLE OF COLLEGE WOMEN COMPLETED MEASURES OF STUDY VARIABLES AT ONE TIME POINT (SAMPLE 1; N = 269, MAGE = 19.96) AND A SECOND SAMPLE DID SO DURING WEEKS 1, 8, AND 16 WHILE PARTICIPATING IN A 16-WEEK YOGA COURSE (SAMPLE 2; N = 323, MAGE = 20.31). IN SAMPLE 1, LATENT VARIABLE STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING SUPPORTED BODY APPRECIATION AS A MEDIATOR BETWEEN SELF-COMPASSION AND INTRINSIC MOTIVATION FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. IN SAMPLE 2, LATENT GROWTH CURVE ANALYSES REVEALED THAT CHANGE IN SELF-COMPASSION PREDICTED CHANGES IN BODY SURVEILLANCE AND BODY APPRECIATION IN EXPECTED DIRECTIONS. FURTHER, CHANGE IN BODY APPRECIATION POSITIVELY PREDICTED CHANGE IN INTRINSIC MOTIVATION. TARGETING SELF-COMPASSION AND BODY APPRECIATION MAY HELP SUPPORT WOMEN'S INTRINSIC MOTIVATION FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
14   68  40 A DIFFERENT WEIGHT LOSS EXPERIENCE: A QUALITATIVE STUDY EXPLORING THE BEHAVIORAL, PHYSICAL, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA THAT PROMOTE WEIGHT LOSS. YOGA INTERVENTIONS IMPROVE OBESITY-RELATED OUTCOMES INCLUDING BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), BODY WEIGHT, BODY FAT, AND WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE, YET IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THESE IMPROVEMENTS ARE DUE TO INCREASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, INCREASED LEAN MUSCLE MASS, AND/OR CHANGES IN EATING BEHAVIORS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXPAND OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE EXPERIENCE OF LOSING WEIGHT THROUGH YOGA. METHODS. SEMISTRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE QUALITATIVELY ANALYZED USING A DESCRIPTIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL APPROACH. RESULTS. TWO DISTINCT GROUPS WHO HAD LOST WEIGHT THROUGH YOGA RESPONDED: THOSE WHO WERE OVERWEIGHT AND HAD REPEATEDLY STRUGGLED IN THEIR ATTEMPTS TO LOSE WEIGHT (55%, N = 11) AND THOSE WHO WERE OF NORMAL WEIGHT AND HAD LOST WEIGHT UNINTENTIONALLY (45%, N = 9). FIVE THEMES EMERGED THAT DIFFERED SLIGHTLY BY GROUP: SHIFT TOWARD HEALTHY EATING, IMPACT OF THE YOGA COMMUNITY/YOGA CULTURE, PHYSICAL CHANGES, PSYCHOLOGICAL CHANGES, AND THE BELIEF THAT THE YOGA WEIGHT LOSS EXPERIENCE WAS DIFFERENT THAN PAST WEIGHT LOSS EXPERIENCES. CONCLUSIONS. THESE FINDINGS IMPLY THAT YOGA COULD OFFER DIVERSE BEHAVIORAL, PHYSICAL, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL EFFECTS THAT MAY MAKE IT A USEFUL TOOL FOR WEIGHT LOSS. ROLE MODELING AND SOCIAL SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THE YOGA COMMUNITY MAY CONTRIBUTE TO WEIGHT LOSS, PARTICULARLY FOR INDIVIDUALS STRUGGLING TO LOSE WEIGHT.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
15 1195  30 EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA INSTRUCTION ON POSITIVE EMBODIMENT AND AFFECTIVE RESPONSES. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR THE INCLUSION OF YOGA AS PART OF EATING DISORDER PREVENTION EFFORTS THROUGH ITS POSITIVE IMPACT ON POSITIVE EMBODIMENT AND EXPERIENCE OF POSITIVE CORE AFFECT. HOWEVER, THERE IS A NEED TO IDENTIFY THE SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES THAT WILL MORE CONSISTENTLY SUPPORT POSITIVE EMBODIMENT AND POSITIVE AFFECT. WE EXAMINED THE EFFECT OF TEACHING A SINGLE YOGA CLASS USING MINDFULNESS-BASED INSTRUCTION COMPARED TO APPEARANCE-BASED AND NEUTRAL INSTRUCTION ALTERNATIVES ON EMBODIMENT (I.E., STATE BODY SURVEILLANCE, STATE BODY APPRECIATION, PLEASURE DURING YOGA) AND CHANGES IN AFFECT FROM BEFORE TO AFTER CLASS. FEMALE PARTICIPANTS (N = 62; M AGE = 23.89, SD = 6.86) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A YOGA CLASS THAT EMPHASIZED: BEING MINDFULLY PRESENT IN ONE'S BODY, CHANGING ONE'S APPEARANCE, OR JUST GETTING INTO YOGA POSES. ANOVAS REVEALED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER BODY SURVEILLANCE (ETAP (2) =.10) AND LOWER FORECASTED PLEASURE (ETAP (2) =.21) IN THE APPEARANCE CLASS COMPARED TO THE OTHER TWO CLASSES. PARTICIPANTS IN THE MINDFULNESS CLASS EXPERIENCED GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN AFFECT (ETAP (2) =.08) FROM BEFORE TO AFTER CLASS AND HIGHER REMEMBERED PLEASURE DURING THE YOGA CLASS (ETAP (2) =.19) COMPARED TO THOSE IN THE APPEARANCE CLASS. EMPHASIZING CHANGES TO APPEARANCE IN YOGA INSTRUCTION MAY PLACE PARTICIPANTS AT RISK FOR LESS POSITIVE AFFECT AND LESS POSITIVE EXPERIENCES OF EMBODIMENT COMPARED TO MINDFULNESS-BASED OR EVEN NEUTRAL YOGA INSTRUCTION.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
16 2469  32 YOGA AS A TREATMENT FOR BINGE EATING DISORDER: A PRELIMINARY STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE EFFICACY OF A 12-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM AIMED AT REDUCING BINGE EATING SEVERITY. DESIGN: A RANDOMISED TRIAL WAS UNDERTAKEN ASSIGNING PARTICIPANTS TO YOGA (N=45) OR WAIT-LIST CONTROL (N=45) GROUPS. OF THESE, 25 IN EACH GROUP WERE ANALYSED. PARTICIPANTS: A COMMUNITY-BASED SAMPLE OF WOMEN BETWEEN 25 AND 63 YEARS OF AGE WHO IDENTIFIED WITH DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR BINGE EATING DISORDER (BED) AND A BMI>25 WERE RECRUITED FOR THE STUDY. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PRIMARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED THE BINGE EATING SCALE (BES) AND INTERNATIONAL PHYSICAL ACTIVITY QUESTIONNAIRE (IPAQ). SECONDARY OUTCOMES COMPRISED MEASURES FOR BMI, HIPS AND WAIST. RESULTS: FOR THE YOGA GROUP, SELF-REPORTED REDUCTIONS IN BINGE EATING AND INCREASES IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. SMALL YET STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS FOR BMI, HIPS AND WAIST MEASUREMENT WERE OBTAINED. THE WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP DID NOT IMPROVE SIGNIFICANTLY ON ANY MEASURES. CONCLUSION: IN CONJUNCTION WITH FORMAL WEEKLY SESSIONS, HOME-BASED YOGA PROGRAMS ARE POTENTIALLY EFFICACIOUS FOR THE TREATMENT OF BINGE EATING.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
17  148  21 A QUALITATIVE EXPLORATION OF IMPLEMENTATION FACTORS IN A SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PROGRAM: LESSONS LEARNED FROM STUDENTS AND TEACHERS. IDENTIFYING FACTORS RELEVANT FOR SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF SCHOOL-BASED INTERVENTIONS IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THAT PROGRAMS ARE PROVIDED IN AN EFFECTIVE AND ENGAGING MANNER. THE PERSPECTIVES OF TWO KEY STAKEHOLDERS CRITICAL FOR IDENTIFYING IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS - STUDENTS AND THEIR CLASSROOM TEACHERS - MERIT ATTENTION IN THIS CONTEXT AND HAVE RARELY BEEN EXPLORED USING QUALITATIVE METHODS. THIS STUDY REPORTS QUALITATIVE PERSPECTIVES OF FIFTH AND SIXTH GRADE PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR TEACHERS OF A 16-WEEK SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PROGRAM IN THREE PUBLIC SCHOOLS SERVING LOW-INCOME URBAN COMMUNITIES. FOUR THEMES RELATED TO PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS EMERGED: PROGRAM DELIVERY FACTORS, PROGRAM BUY-IN, IMPLEMENTER COMMUNICATION WITH TEACHERS, AND INSTRUCTOR QUALITIES. FEEDBACK FROM STUDENTS AND TEACHERS IS DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT OF INFORMING IMPLEMENTATION, ADAPTATION, AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PROGRAMMING IN URBAN SETTINGS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
18  474  24 CLAIMING PEACEFUL EMBODIMENT THROUGH YOGA IN THE AFTERMATH OF TRAUMA. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DESCRIBE THE EXPERIENCES OF PRACTICING YOGA AND ITS ROLE WITHIN PROCESSES OF HEALING FOR ADULT WOMEN WITH COMPLEX TRAUMA HISTORIES. USING A HERMENEUTIC PHENOMENOLOGICAL METHOD, DATA WERE ANALYZED FROM INTERVIEWS WITH 39 WOMEN. RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE CORE MEANING OF PARTICIPANTS' EXPERIENCE OF HEALING THROUGH YOGA IS CLAIMING PEACEFUL EMBODIMENT. THIS IS AN ONGOING PROCESS OCCURRING ON A CONTINUUM WHEREBY WOMEN EXPERIENCED IMPROVED CONNECTIONS WITH AND SENSE OF OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OVER THEIR BODIES, EMOTIONS AND THOUGHTS, AND A GREATER SENSE OF WELL-BEING, CALMNESS, AND WHOLENESS IN THEIR BODIES AND MINDS. A NUMBER OF INTERCONNECTED ESSENTIAL THEMES RELATED TO THIS CORE MEANING WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED, ILLUMINATING PROCESSES THAT SUPPORTED CLAIMING PEACEFUL EMBODIMENT AND CAPABILITIES THAT WERE ENABLED BY BEING MORE PEACEFULLY EMBODIED. ADDITIONAL THEMES WERE IDENTIFIED HIGHLIGHTING FACTORS THAT FACILITATED OR IMPEDED PARTICIPANTS' ENGAGEMENT WITH YOGA AND THEIR EXPERIENCES OF HEALING THROUGH YOGA.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
19  250  29 A YOGA INTERVENTION PROGRAM FOR PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM SYMPTOMS OF POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER: A QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTIVE STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO UNDERSTAND HOW INDIVIDUALS WITH SYMPTOMS OF POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) PERCEIVE A TRAUMA-SENSITIVE KUNDALINI YOGA (KY) PROGRAM. METHODS: DIGITALLY RECORDED TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS 30-60 MINUTES IN DURATION WERE CONDUCTED WITH 40 INDIVIDUALS WITH PTSD PARTICIPATING IN AN 8-WEEK KY TREATMENT PROGRAM. INTERVIEWS WERE TRANSCRIBED VERBATIM AND ANALYZED USING QUALITATIVE THEMATIC ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES. RESULTS: QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS IDENTIFIES THREE MAJOR THEMES: SELF-OBSERVED CHANGES, NEW AWARENESS, AND THE YOGA PROGRAM ITSELF. FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT PARTICIPANTS NOTED CHANGES IN AREAS OF HEALTH AND WELL-BEING, LIFESTYLE, PSYCHOSOCIAL INTEGRATION, AND PERCEPTIONS OF SELF IN RELATION TO THE WORLD. PRESENTED ARE PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS FOR TRAUMA-RELATED PROGRAMMING. CONCLUSION: THERE IS A NEED TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE AND POTENTIALLY EMPOWERING APPROACHES TO TRAUMA TREATMENT. YOGA-RELATED SELF-CARE OR SELF-MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES ARE WIDELY ACCESSIBLE, ARE EMPOWERING, AND MAY ADDRESS THE MIND-BODY ELEMENTS OF PTSD.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
20 2739  43 YOGA PRACTICE AMONG ETHNICALLY/RACIALLY DIVERSE EMERGING ADULTS: ASSOCIATIONS WITH BODY IMAGE, MINDFUL AND DISORDERED EATING, AND MUSCLE-ENHANCING BEHAVIORS. BACKGROUND: THIS STUDY EXPLORES CROSS-SECTIONAL ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN YOGA AND BODY IMAGE, MINDFUL EATING, DISORDERED EATING, AND MUSCLE-ENHANCING BEHAVIORS AMONG A POPULATION-BASED SAMPLE OF ETHNICALLY/RACIALLY DIVERSE EMERGING ADULTS. METHOD: AN ETHNICALLY/RACIALLY DIVERSE POPULATION-BASED SAMPLE OF 1,568 EMERGING ADULTS (18-26 YEARS) COMPLETED SURVEYS AS PART OF EAT 2010-2018 (EATING AND ACTIVITY OVER TIME). MODELS WERE ADJUSTED FOR SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS AND BODY MASS INDEX (BMI). RESULTS: PRACTICING YOGA AT LEAST 30 MIN/WEEK WAS REPORTED BY 12.7% (N = 210) OF THE SAMPLE. YOGA PRACTITIONERS HAD HIGHER LEVELS OF MINDFUL EATING THAN THOSE NOT PRACTICING YOGA. ALTHOUGH EFFECT SIZES WERE SMALL, YOGA PRACTITIONERS WERE MORE LIKELY THAN NON-YOGA PRACTITIONERS TO USE STEROIDS (3.8 VS. 0.7%, P < .001, H = 0.22) OR PROTEIN POWDER/SHAKES (35.1 VS. 25.3%, P < .010, H = 0.21) TO INCREASE THEIR MUSCLE SIZE/TONE. BODY SATISFACTION, UNHEALTHY WEIGHT CONTROL BEHAVIORS, AND BINGE EATING TENDED TO BE SIMILAR AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND NON-YOGA PRACTITIONERS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION BETWEEN BMI AND YOGA IN PREDICTING BODY SATISFACTION WITH A TREND TOWARD A POSITIVE IMPACT AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS AT HIGHER BMI VALUES. INTERACTIONS BETWEEN YOGA PRACTICE AND ALL BODY IMAGE ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS ACROSS GENDER AND ETHNICITY/RACE WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. DISCUSSION: YOUNG PEOPLE FROM DIVERSE ETHNIC/RACIAL BACKGROUNDS WHO PRACTICE YOGA ARE MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN MINDFUL EATING BUT HAVE EQUAL OR ELEVATED LEVELS OF UNHEALTHY BODY IMAGE ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS AS COMPARED TO NON-YOGA PRACTITIONERS. FURTHER RESEARCH SHOULD EXPLORE HOW YOGA IS BEST TAUGHT AND PRACTICED TO ENSURE THAT IT IS BENEFICIAL FOR BODY IMAGE AND RELATED BEHAVIORS.	2021

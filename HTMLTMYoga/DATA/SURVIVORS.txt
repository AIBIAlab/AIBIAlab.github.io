1 1746 139 PILOT EVALUATION OF AN IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM FOR BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. BACKGROUND: WITH CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENTS IN SCREENING UPTAKE AND ADJUVANT CANCER TREATMENTS, THE NUMBER OF CANADIAN WOMEN SURVIVING BREAST CANCER CONTINUES TO GROW. PRELIMINARY FINDINGS SUGGEST YOGA CAN IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS, BUT FEW STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON IYENGAR YOGA (IY). OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF IY ON QOL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING IN A SELECT SAMPLE OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. METHODS: BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS (N = 24) PARTICIPATING IN IY CLASSES COMPLETED A QUESTIONNAIRE MEASURING GENERIC AND DISEASE-SPECIFIC QOL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING, BEFORE AND AFTER THE 12-WEEK CLASSES. RESULTS: POSTPROGRAM QUESTIONNAIRES WERE COMPLETED BY 17 PARTICIPANTS (71%) WHO ATTENDED AN AVERAGE OF 78.9% OF THE IY SESSIONS. SEVERAL INDICATORS OF GENERIC QOL IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY, INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH (MEAN CHANGE, +4.2; P = .045), VITALITY (MEAN CHANGE, +4.9; P = .033), ROLE-EMOTIONAL (MEAN CHANGE, +6.4; P = .010), AND BODILY PAIN (MEAN CHANGE, +4.4; P = .024). OTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN QOL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING WERE MEANINGFUL BUT WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. FINDINGS WERE FURTHER SUBSTANTIATED BY PARTICIPANT'S EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM'S BENEFITS AND MOTIVATIONAL VALUE. CONCLUSION: IN THIS PILOT STUDY OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS PARTICIPATING IN IY, WE FOUND IMPROVEMENTS IN QOL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING. MOREOVER, POSITIVE PROGRAM EVALUATION AND MOTIVATIONAL PROFILE PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THE ACCEPTABILITY OF IY WITH BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS COMPARING IY TO USUAL CARE AND OTHER FORMS OF YOGA IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS ARE WARRANTED. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: NURSES MAY CONSIDER IY AS A POSSIBLE INTERVENTION STRATEGY TO HELP BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS IMPROVE THEIR QOL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
2 1865  41 RANDOMIZED PILOT TRIAL OF YOGA VERSUS STRENGTHENING EXERCISES IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WITH CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE. PURPOSE: FATIGUE IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON AND BOTHERSOME REFRACTORY SYMPTOMS EXPERIENCED BY CANCER SURVIVORS. MINDFUL EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS YOGA IMPROVE CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE; HOWEVER, STUDIES OF YOGA HAVE INCLUDED HETEROGENEOUS SURVIVORSHIP POPULATIONS, AND THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON FATIGUED SURVIVORS REMAINS UNCLEAR. METHODS: WE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED 34 EARLY-STAGE BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WITH CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (>/=4 ON A LIKERT SCALE FROM 1-10) WITHIN 1 YEAR FROM DIAGNOSIS TO A 12-WEEK INTERVENTION OF HOME-BASED YOGA VERSUS STRENGTHENING EXERCISES, BOTH PRESENTED ON A DVD. THE PRIMARY ENDPOINTS WERE FEASIBILITY AND CHANGES IN FATIGUE, AS MEASURED BY THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL FATIGUE SYMPTOM INVENTORY-SHORT FORM (MFSI-SF). SECONDARY ENDPOINT WAS QUALITY OF LIFE, ASSESSED BY THE FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CANCER THERAPIES-BREAST (FACT-B). RESULTS: WE INVITED 401 WOMEN TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY; 78 RESPONDED, AND WE ENROLLED 34. BOTH GROUPS HAD SIGNIFICANT WITHIN-GROUP IMPROVEMENT IN MULTIPLE DOMAINS OF THE FATIGUE AND QUALITY OF LIFE SCORES FROM BASELINE TO POST-INTERVENTION, AND THESE BENEFITS WERE MAINTAINED AT 3 MONTHS POST-INTERVENTION. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS IN FATIGUE OR QUALITY OF LIFE AT ANY ASSESSMENT TIME. SIMILARLY, THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS IN ADHERENCE TO THE EXERCISE INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: BOTH DVD-BASED YOGA AND STRENGTHENING EXERCISES DESIGNED FOR CANCER SURVIVORS MAY BE GOOD OPTIONS TO ADDRESS FATIGUE IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. BOTH HAVE REASONABLE UPTAKE, ARE CONVENIENT AND REPRODUCIBLE, AND MAY BE HELPFUL IN DECREASING FATIGUE AND IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE FIRST YEAR POST-DIAGNOSIS IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WITH CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
3 1052  43 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE AND GLOBAL SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN IN OLDER CANCER SURVIVORS. BACKGROUND: SIXTY PERCENT OF CANCER SURVIVORS ARE 65YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER. CANCER AND ITS TREATMENTS LEAD TO CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE AND MANY OTHER SIDE EFFECTS, IN TURN, CREATING SUBSTANTIAL GLOBAL SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN (TOTAL BURDEN FROM ALL SIDE EFFECTS) WHICH, ULTIMATELY, COMPROMISES FUNCTIONAL INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY OF LIFE. VARIOUS MODES OF EXERCISE, SUCH AS YOGA, REDUCE CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE AND GLOBAL SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN IN YOUNGER CANCER SURVIVORS, BUT NO STUDIES HAVE SPECIFICALLY EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON OLDER CANCER SURVIVORS. OBJECTIVES: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF A 4-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION (YOGA FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: YOCAS(C)(R)) ON OVERALL CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, AND DUE TO ITS MULTIDIMENSIONAL NATURE, THE SUBDOMAINS OF CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (GENERAL, PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, AND MENTAL) AND GLOBAL SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN IN OLDER CANCER SURVIVORS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A SECONDARY ANALYSIS ON DATA FROM A MULTICENTER PHASE III RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL WITH 2 ARMS (STANDARD CARE AND STANDARD CARE PLUS A 4-WEEK YOCAS(C)(R) INTERVENTION). THE SAMPLE FOR THIS SECONDARY ANALYSIS WAS 97 OLDER CANCER SURVIVORS (>/=60YEARS OF AGE), BETWEEN 2MONTHS AND 2YEARS POST-TREATMENT, WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE ORIGINAL TRIAL. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOCAS(C)(R) INTERVENTION ARM REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, PHYSICAL FATIGUE, MENTAL FATIGUE, AND GLOBAL SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN THAN PARTICIPANTS IN THE STANDARD CARE ARM FOLLOWING THE 4-WEEK INTERVENTION PERIOD (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: YOCAS(C)(R) IS AN EFFECTIVE STANDARDIZED YOGA INTERVENTION FOR REDUCING CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, PHYSICAL FATIGUE, MENTAL FATIGUE, AND GLOBAL SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN AMONG OLDER CANCER SURVIVORS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
4 1460  39 INFLUENCE OF YOGA ON CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE AND ON MEDIATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CHANGES IN SLEEP AND CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE: A NATIONWIDE, MULTICENTER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA IN CANCER SURVIVORS. BACKGROUND: CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (CRF) OFTEN CO-OCCURS WITH SLEEP DISTURBANCE AND IS ONE OF THE MOST PERVASIVE TOXICITIES RESULTING FROM CANCER AND ITS TREATMENT. WE AND OTHER INVESTIGATORS HAVE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THAT YOGA THERAPY CAN IMPROVE SLEEP QUALITY IN CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS. NO NATIONWIDE MULTICENTER PHASE III RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) HAS INVESTIGATED WHETHER YOGA THERAPY IMPROVES CRF OR WHETHER IMPROVEMENTS IN SLEEP MEDIATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON CRF. WE EXAMINED THE EFFECT OF A STANDARDIZED, 4-WEEK, YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM (YOGA FOR CANCER SURVIVORS [YOCAS]) ON CRF AND WHETHER YOCAS-INDUCED CHANGES IN SLEEP MEDIATED CHANGES IN CRF AMONG SURVIVORS. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: FOUR HUNDRED TEN CANCER SURVIVORS WERE RECRUITED TO A NATIONWIDE MULTICENTER PHASE III RCT COMPARING THE EFFECT OF YOCAS TO STANDARD SURVIVORSHIP CARE ON CRF AND EXAMINING THE MEDIATING EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN SLEEP, STEMMING FROM YOGA, ON CHANGES IN CRF. CRF WAS ASSESSED BY THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL FATIGUE SYMPTOM INVENTORY. SLEEP WAS ASSESSED VIA THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX. BETWEEN- AND WITHIN-GROUP INTERVENTION EFFECTS ON CRF WERE ASSESSED BY ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE AND 2-TAILED T TEST, RESPECTIVELY. PATH ANALYSIS WAS USED TO EVALUATE MEDIATION. RESULTS: YOCAS PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN CRF COMPARED WITH PARTICIPANTS IN STANDARD SURVIVORSHIP CARE AT POST-INTERVENTION ( P < .01). IMPROVEMENTS IN OVERALL SLEEP QUALITY AND REDUCTIONS IN DAYTIME DYSFUNCTION (EG, EXCESSIVE NAPPING) RESULTING FROM YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY MEDIATED THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON CRF (22% AND 37%, RESPECTIVELY, BOTH P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: YOCAS IS EFFECTIVE FOR TREATING CRF AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS; 22% TO 37% OF THE IMPROVEMENTS IN CRF FROM YOGA THERAPY RESULT FROM IMPROVEMENTS IN SLEEP QUALITY AND DAYTIME DYSFUNCTION. ONCOLOGISTS SHOULD CONSIDER PRESCRIBING YOGA TO CANCER SURVIVORS FOR TREATING CRF AND SLEEP DISTURBANCE.	2019	

5 1192  45 EXAMINING A THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS. BACKGROUND: IN THE EARLIER STAGES OF PROSTATE CANCER, EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS HAVE CREATED A NEED FOR RESEARCH TO FOCUS ON PRACTICES THAT MAY IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE THROUGHOUT SURVIVORSHIP. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS A SIGNIFICANT SUPPORTIVE CARE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS, THOUGH THE OPTIMAL MODALITY IS NOT YET UNDERSTOOD. HYPOTHESES: THE AUTHORS HYPOTHESIZED THAT YOGA WOULD BE A FEASIBLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OPTION FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS AND THEIR SUPPORT PERSONS AND THAT THE INCORPORATION OF SOCIAL SUPPORT WOULD INCREASE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ADHERENCE. METHODS: THIS 14-WEEK FEASIBILITY STUDY INVOLVED A 7-WEEK CLASS-BASED YOGA PROGRAM (ADHERENCE PHASE), FOLLOWED BY 7 WEEKS OF SELF-SELECTED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (MAINTENANCE PHASE). DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEHAVIOR, QUALITY OF LIFE, FATIGUE, STRESS, MOOD, AND FITNESS VARIABLES WERE ASSESSED AT 3 TIME POINTS. PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS' PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT WAS RATED DURING YOGA AND AFTER YOGA. RESULTS: CLASS ATTENDANCE WAS 6.1 AND 5.8 FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS (N = 15) AND THEIR SUPPORT PERSONS (N = 10), RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE 7 CLASSES. LEVELS OF PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT WERE HIGHER FOR THOSE WHO BROUGHT A SUPPORT PERSON. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WITH REGARD TO STRESS, FATIGUE, AND MOOD BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA CLASS (ALL PS < .05) WERE REPORTED BY ALL PARTICIPANTS. NO CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE NOTED ON PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVOR'S QUALITY OF LIFE OR FATIGUE OVER THE COURSE OF THE 14-WEEK STUDY. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA IS A FEASIBLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OPTION FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS. THE PROGRAM HAD A PROMISING UPTAKE RATE, HIGH PROGRAM ADHERENCE RATE, AND THERE WERE ACUTE PROGRAM BENEFITS WITH REGARD TO STRESS, FATIGUE, AND MOOD FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS. FUTURE EXAMINATION IS WARRANTED WITH REGARD TO CHRONIC BENEFITS AND GROUP COHESION INFLUENCES ON LEVELS OF PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                             
6 2605  42 YOGA FOR PERSISTENT FATIGUE IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS: RESULTS OF A PILOT STUDY. APPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS EXPERIENCES PERSISTENT FATIGUE FOR MONTHS OR YEARS AFTER SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT COMPLETION. THERE IS A LACK OF EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENTS FOR CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, PARTICULARLY AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS. THIS SINGLE-ARM PILOT STUDY EVALUATED THE FEASIBILITY AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR FATIGUED BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS BASED ON THE IYENGAR TRADITION. IYENGAR YOGA PRESCRIBES SPECIFIC POSES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SPECIFIC MEDICAL PROBLEMS AND CONDITIONS; THIS TRIAL EMPHASIZED POSTURES BELIEVED TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR REDUCING FATIGUE AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS, INCLUDING INVERSIONS AND BACKBENDS PERFORMED WITH THE SUPPORT OF PROPS. TWELVE WOMEN WERE ENROLLED IN THE TRIAL, AND 11 COMPLETED THE FULL 12-WEEK COURSE OF TREATMENT. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN FATIGUE SCORES FROM PRE- TO POST-INTERVENTION THAT WAS MAINTAINED AT THE 3-MONTH POST-INTERVENTION FOLLOWUP. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE ALSO OBSERVED IN MEASURES OF PHYSICAL FUNCTION, DEPRESSED MOOD, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. THESE RESULTS SUPPORT THE ACCEPTABILITY OF THIS INTERVENTION AND SUGGEST THAT IT MAY HAVE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON PERSISTENT POST-TREATMENT FATIGUE. HOWEVER, RESULTS REQUIRE REPLICATION IN A LARGER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
7 2093  31 THE EFFECT OF YOCAS(C)(R) YOGA FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS ON HORMONAL THERAPY. UP TO 50% OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS ON AROMATASE INHIBITOR THERAPY REPORT MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS SUCH AS JOINT AND MUSCLE PAIN, SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTING TREATMENT ADHERENCE AND DISCONTINUATION RATES. WE CONDUCTED A SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS OF A NATIONWIDE, MULTI-SITE, PHASE II/III RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED, CLINICAL TRIAL EXAMINING THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR IMPROVING MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS CURRENTLY RECEIVING HORMONE THERAPY (AROMATASE INHIBITORS [AI] OR TAMOXIFEN [TAM]). BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS CURRENTLY RECEIVING AI (N = 95) OR TAM (N = 72) WITH NO PARTICIPATION IN YOGA DURING THE PREVIOUS 3 MONTHS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO 2 ARMS: (1) STANDARD CARE MONITORING AND (2) STANDARD CARE PLUS THE 4-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION (2X/WEEK; 75 MIN/SESSION) AND INCLUDED IN THIS ANALYSIS. THE YOGA INTERVENTION UTILIZED THE UR YOGA FOR CANCER SURVIVORS (YOCAS(C)((R))) PROGRAM CONSISTING OF BREATHING EXERCISES, 18 GENTLE HATHA AND RESTORATIVE YOGA POSTURES, AND MEDITATION. MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS WERE ASSESSED PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION. AT BASELINE, AI USERS REPORTED HIGHER LEVELS OF GENERAL PAIN, MUSCLE ACHES, AND TOTAL PHYSICAL DISCOMFORT THAN TAM USERS (ALL P </= 0.05). AMONG ALL BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS ON HORMONAL THERAPY, PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP DEMONSTRATED GREATER REDUCTIONS IN MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS SUCH AS GENERAL PAIN, MUSCLE ACHES AND TOTAL PHYSICAL DISCOMFORT FROM PRE- TO POST-INTERVENTION THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (ALL P </= 0.05). THE SEVERITY OF MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS WAS HIGHER FOR AI USERS COMPARED TO TAM USERS. AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS ON HORMONE THERAPY, THE BRIEF COMMUNITY-BASED YOCAS(C)(R) INTERVENTION SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED GENERAL PAIN, MUSCLE ACHES, AND PHYSICAL DISCOMFORT.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
8 2604  42 YOGA FOR PERSISTENT FATIGUE IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE AFFLICTS UP TO 33% OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS, YET THERE ARE NO EMPIRICALLY VALIDATED TREATMENTS FOR THIS SYMPTOM. METHODS: THE AUTHORS CONDUCTED A 2-GROUP RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFICACY OF AN IYENGAR YOGA INTERVENTION FOR BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WITH PERSISTENT POST-TREATMENT FATIGUE. PARTICIPANTS WERE BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WHO HAD COMPLETED CANCER TREATMENTS (OTHER THAN ENDOCRINE THERAPY) AT LEAST 6 MONTHS BEFORE ENROLLMENT, REPORTED SIGNIFICANT CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, AND HAD NO OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT WOULD ACCOUNT FOR FATIGUE SYMPTOMS OR INTERFERE WITH YOGA PRACTICE. BLOCK RANDOMIZATION WAS USED TO ASSIGN PARTICIPANTS TO A 12-WEEK, IYENGAR-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION OR TO 12 WEEKS OF HEALTH EDUCATION (CONTROL). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS CHANGE IN FATIGUE MEASURED AT BASELINE, IMMEDIATELY POST-TREATMENT, AND 3 MONTHS AFTER TREATMENT COMPLETION. ADDITIONAL OUTCOMES INCLUDED CHANGES IN VIGOR, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, SLEEP, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE. INTENT-TO-TREAT ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED WITH ALL RANDOMIZED PARTICIPANTS USING LINEAR MIXED MODELS. RESULTS: THIRTY-ONE WOMEN WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO YOGA (N = 16) OR HEALTH EDUCATION (N = 15). FATIGUE SEVERITY DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM BASELINE TO POST-TREATMENT AND OVER A 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP IN THE YOGA GROUP RELATIVE TO CONTROLS (P = .032). IN ADDITION, THE YOGA GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN VIGOR RELATIVE TO CONTROLS (P = .011). BOTH GROUPS HAD POSITIVE CHANGES IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND PERCEIVED STRESS (P < .05). NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN SLEEP OR PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE WERE OBSERVED. CONCLUSIONS: A TARGETED YOGA INTERVENTION LED TO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN FATIGUE AND VIGOR AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WITH PERSISTENT FATIGUE SYMPTOMS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
9 1650  42 MULTICENTER, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA FOR SLEEP QUALITY AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS. PURPOSE: THIRTY PERCENT TO 90% OF CANCER SURVIVORS REPORT IMPAIRED SLEEP QUALITY POST-TREATMENT, WHICH CAN BE SEVERE ENOUGH TO INCREASE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS EXERCISE, ARE RECOMMENDED IN CONJUNCTION WITH DRUGS AND COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF IMPAIRED SLEEP. PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT YOGA-A MIND-BODY PRACTICE AND FORM OF EXERCISE-MAY IMPROVE SLEEP AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS. THE PRIMARY AIM OF THIS RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF A STANDARDIZED YOGA INTERVENTION COMPARED WITH STANDARD CARE FOR IMPROVING GLOBAL SLEEP QUALITY (PRIMARY OUTCOME) AMONG POST-TREATMENT CANCER SURVIVORS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: IN ALL, 410 SURVIVORS SUFFERING FROM MODERATE OR GREATER SLEEP DISRUPTION BETWEEN 2 AND 24 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY, CHEMOTHERAPY, AND/OR RADIATION THERAPY WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO STANDARD CARE OR STANDARD CARE PLUS THE 4-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. THE YOGA INTERVENTION USED THE YOGA FOR CANCER SURVIVORS (YOCAS) PROGRAM CONSISTING OF PRANAYAMA (BREATHING EXERCISES), 16 GENTLE HATHA AND RESTORATIVE YOGA ASANAS (POSTURES), AND MEDITATION. PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED TWO 75-MINUTE SESSIONS PER WEEK. SLEEP QUALITY WAS ASSESSED BY USING THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX AND ACTIGRAPHY PRE- AND POSTINTERVENTION. RESULTS: IN ALL, 410 SURVIVORS WERE ACCRUED (96% FEMALE; MEAN AGE, 54 YEARS; 75% HAD BREAST CANCER). YOGA PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN GLOBAL SLEEP QUALITY AND, SECONDARILY, SUBJECTIVE SLEEP QUALITY, DAYTIME DYSFUNCTION, WAKE AFTER SLEEP ONSET, SLEEP EFFICIENCY, AND MEDICATION USE AT POSTINTERVENTION (ALL P </= .05) COMPARED WITH STANDARD CARE PARTICIPANTS. CONCLUSION: YOGA, SPECIFICALLY THE YOCAS PROGRAM, IS A USEFUL TREATMENT FOR IMPROVING SLEEP QUALITY AND REDUCING SLEEP MEDICATION USE AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
10  201  40 A RESTORATIVE YOGA INTERVENTION FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: DATA SHOW THAT YOGA IS EFFECTIVE FOR IMPROVING HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOMES IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. WHILE BREAST CANCER IS THE MOST COMMONLY DIAGNOSED CANCER AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN (AAW), AAW ARE LESS LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN YOGA COMPARED TO OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS. THE GOALS OF THE CURRENT STUDY WERE TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF AN 8-WEEK RESTORATIVE YOGA PROGRAM AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICAN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS (AA BCS). SPECIFICALLY, STUDY AIMS WERE TO (1) MEASURE CHANGES IN STUDY OUTCOMES IN A RESTORATIVE YOGA (RY) GROUP COMPARED TO A WAIT LIST CONTROL GROUP, (2) ASSESS ADHERENCE TO THE RY PROGRAM, AND (3) ASSESS PROGRAM SATISFACTION AMONG STUDY PARTICIPANTS. METHODS: THIRTY-THREE AA BCS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER THE RY INTERVENTION (N = 18) OR WAIT LIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 15). RY CLASSES MET ONCE PER WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS. PRE- AND POST-TESTING ASSESSMENTS WERE MEASURED AT 0 AND 8 WEEKS (IMMEDIATELY POST-INTERVENTION). RESULTS: DEPRESSION SCORES AT FOLLOW-UP WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN THE YOGA GROUP (M = 4.78, SD = 3.56) COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP (M = 6.91, SD = 5.86). NO SIGNIFICANT GROUP DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED FOR SLEEP QUALITY, FATIGUE, OR PERCEIVED STRESS. YOGA PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS COMPLETING BASELINE ASSESSMENTS DEMONSTRATED 61% ADHERENCE TO THE YOGA CLASSES. AVERAGE RATING OF THE YOGA PROGRAM WAS "VERY USEFUL." RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE YOGA PROGRAMS WERE PROVIDED. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT YOGA HAS A BENEFICIAL EFFECT ON DEPRESSION IN AA BCS. THERE IS, HOWEVER, A NEED TO FURTHER EXPLORE THE BENEFITS OF YOGA AMONG MINORITY BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS USING A STUDY WITH LARGER SAMPLE SIZES.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
11  478  36 CLINICAL CASE REPORT: YOGA FOR FATIGUE IN FIVE YOUNG ADULT SURVIVORS OF CHILDHOOD CANCER. PURPOSE: CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (CRF) IS A DISTRESSING CONSEQUENCE OF CANCER AND ITS TREATMENT. CRF IMPACTS MANY YOUNG ADULT (YA) SURVIVORS OF CHILDHOOD CANCER, COMPROMISING WORK, SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND DAILY ACTIVITIES. NO SATISFACTORY TREATMENT EXISTS. THIS PILOT STUDY AIMED TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY, SAFETY, AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF AN 8-WEEK TWICE/WEEK IYENGAR YOGA (IY) INTERVENTION FOR TREATING PERSISTENT FATIGUE IN YA SURVIVORS OF CHILDHOOD CANCER. METHODS: USING A SINGLE-ARM MIXED-METHODS DESIGN, ADULT CHILDHOOD CANCER SURVIVORS AGED BETWEEN 18 AND 39 YEARS WERE RECRUITED FROM A SURVIVORSHIP CLINIC AT A SINGLE INSTITUTION. QUANTITATIVE: THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS FATIGUE AS MEASURED BY THE FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CHRONIC ILLNESS THERAPY-FATIGUE. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED VITALITY, SOCIAL FUNCTIONING, MULTIDIMENSIONAL FATIGUE, MOOD, AND SLEEP. WEEKLY SELF-REPORT MONITORING DATA WERE COLLECTED. QUALITATIVE: PARTICIPANTS ALSO COMPLETED A POST-INTERVENTION INTERVIEW, MAJOR THEMES EVALUATED. RESULTS: FIVE PARTICIPANTS ENROLLED INTO THE STUDY AND FOUR COMPLETED THE INTERVENTION. ATTENDANCE WAS 92% AND THERE WERE NO ADVERSE EVENTS. BASELINE MOBILITY WAS HIGHLY VARIED, WITH ONE YA HAVING HAD A HEMIPELVECTOMY. QUANTITATIVE DATA REVEALED SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED FATIGUE, SOCIAL FUNCTIONING, SOMATIZATION, AND GENERAL AND EMOTIONAL MANIFESTATIONS OF FATIGUE FOLLOWING YOGA. QUALITATIVE DATA CROSS VALIDATED, CLARIFIED, AND EXPANDED UPON THE QUANTITATIVE FINDINGS. CONCLUSIONS: THE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT A BRIEF IY INTERVENTION IS SAFE FOR YA SURVIVORS OF CHILDHOOD CANCER, EVEN FOR THOSE WITH PHYSICAL DISABILITIES. PRELIMINARY EFFICACY WAS DEMONSTRATED FOR THE PRIMARY OUTCOME OF FATIGUE. QUALITATIVE DATA ELUCIDATED ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS, SUCH AS WORK-RELATED SOCIAL FUNCTIONING, AND A SENSE OF CALM AND RELAXATION.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
12 1750  36 PILOT STUDY OF YOGA FOR BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WITH POOR QUALITY OF LIFE. INTRODUCTION: STUDIES SHOW BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WITH POOR QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL); HOWEVER, NONE EXCLUSIVELY FOCUS ON SURVIVORS. THIS STUDY ADDRESSES WHETHER HATHA YOGA IMPROVES BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS' QOL. METHODS: 25 BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS COMPLETED SIX WEEKS OF YOGA. OUTCOME MEASURES WERE 5 QOL CATEGORIES EVALUATED USING THE FACT-B SURVEY PRE AND POST-INTERVENTION AND AFTER 6 MONTHS. RESULTS: EACH CATEGORY WAS EVALUATED INDEPENDENTLY, INCLUDING: PHYSICAL (PWB), SOCIAL (SWB), EMOTIONAL (EWB), FUNCTIONAL (FWB), BREAST CANCER SPECIFIC WELL-BEING (BCS), TRIAL OUTCOME INDEX (TOI), FACT-G, AND FACT-B. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT WAS FOUND IN ALL CATEGORIES EXCEPT SOCIAL WELL-BEING (PWB P = .013, EWB P = .005, FWB P = .003, BCS P < .001, TOI P < .001, FACT-G P = .004, FACT-B P < .001). PATIENTS WITH BELOW AVERAGE PRE-INTERVENTION INDEX SCORES (N = 13) SHOWED GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN EWB AND FWB, WHILE THOSE WITH ABOVE AVERAGE PRE-INTERVENTION SCORES (N = 9) SHOWED GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN PWB. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA MAY BE FEASIBLE AND CLINICALLY USEFUL FOR BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WITH POOR QOL.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
13 2557  45 YOGA FOR CHRONIC CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY PAIN: A PILOT, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. PURPOSE: TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR CANCER SURVIVORS WITH CHRONIC CIPN PAIN, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF THE INTERVENTION ON PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES. METHODS: CANCER SURVIVORS WITH CHRONIC CIPN PAIN WERE RECRUITED FROM THE BREAST, GASTROINTESTINAL, AND GYNECOLOGICAL ONCOLOGY CENTERS AT DANA-FARBER CANCER INSTITUTE. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED (2:1) TO RECEIVE AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION OR USUAL CARE. AFTER 21/50 OF PARTICIPANTS WERE ENROLLED, THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC REQUIRED THE YOGA INTERVENTION TO BE DELIVERED VIRTUALLY (I.E., ZOOM). PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION, PARTICIPANTS SELF-REPORTED CIPN AND CO-OCCURRING SYMPTOM SEVERITY. ADHERENCE TO THE INTERVENTION WAS DEFINED AS PRACTICING >/= 12 YOGA SESSIONS OVER THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION PERIOD. CHANGES IN PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES BETWEEN GROUPS WERE COMPARED USING WILCOXON'S RANK-SUM TESTS. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS (N = 28 YOGA, N = 16 CONTROL) WERE MAINLY FEMALE (96%) AND DIAGNOSED WITH STAGE III/IV DISEASE (66%). OVERALL, 19/28 (67.8%) OF YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS WERE ADHERENT TO THE YOGA PROTOCOL. YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT WITHIN-GROUP IMPROVEMENTS IN ALL PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES, INCLUDING WORST CIPN PAIN (MEDIAN CHANGE = - 1.7, P < 0.0001) AND SENSORY CIPN (MEDIAN CHANGE = - 14.8, P < 0.0001), BUT ONLY IMPROVEMENTS IN FATIGUE (P = 0.05) AND DEPRESSION (P = 0.04) WERE SIGNIFICANT COMPARED TO THE CONTROL. THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES (P > 0.05) IN CHANGES IN PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES BETWEEN IN-PERSON (N = 6) OR VIRTUAL (N = 15) YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA IS A FEASIBLE NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL MODALITY FOR CANCER SURVIVORS WITH CIPN, BUT MORE INFORMATION IS NEEDED REGARDING ITS IMPACT ON CIPN AND OTHER SYMPTOMS. TRIAL REGISTRATION: CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT03824860 IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: ONCOLOGY CLINICIANS MAY CONSIDER REFERRING CANCER SURVIVORS TO YOGA FOR CHRONIC CIPN PAIN, BUT YOGA CANNOT BE CURRENTLY RECOMMENDED AS AN EFFICACIOUS TREATMENT.	2021	
                                        
14 2442  43 YOGA AND SELF-REPORTED COGNITIVE PROBLEMS IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: CANCER SURVIVORS OFTEN REPORT COGNITIVE PROBLEMS. FURTHERMORE, DECREASES IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TYPICALLY OCCUR OVER THE COURSE OF CANCER TREATMENT. ALTHOUGH PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BENEFITS COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN NONCANCER POPULATIONS, EVIDENCE LINKING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN CANCER SURVIVORS IS LIMITED. IN OUR RECENT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WHO RECEIVED A YOGA INTERVENTION HAD LOWER FATIGUE AND INFLAMMATION FOLLOWING THE TRIAL COMPARED WITH A WAIT LIST CONTROL GROUP. THIS SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF THE PARENT TRIAL ADDRESSED YOGA'S IMPACT ON COGNITIVE COMPLAINTS. METHODS: POSTTREATMENT STAGE 0-IIIA BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS (N = 200) WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 12-WEEK, TWICE-WEEKLY HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION OR A WAIT LIST CONTROL GROUP. PARTICIPANTS REPORTED COGNITIVE COMPLAINTS USING THE BREAST CANCER PREVENTION TRIAL COGNITIVE PROBLEMS SCALE AT BASELINE, IMMEDIATELY POSTINTERVENTION, AND 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: COGNITIVE COMPLAINTS DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN GROUPS IMMEDIATELY POSTINTERVENTION (P = 0.250). HOWEVER, AT 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP, YOGA PARTICIPANTS' BREAST CANCER PREVENTION TRIAL COGNITIVE PROBLEMS SCALE SCORES WERE AN AVERAGE OF 23% LOWER THAN WAIT LIST PARTICIPANTS' SCORES (P = 0.003). THESE GROUP DIFFERENCES IN COGNITIVE COMPLAINTS REMAINED AFTER CONTROLLING FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, FATIGUE, AND SLEEP QUALITY. CONSISTENT WITH THE PRIMARY RESULTS, THOSE WHO PRACTICED YOGA MORE FREQUENTLY REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER COGNITIVE PROBLEMS AT 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP THAN THOSE WHO PRACTICED LESS FREQUENTLY (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA CAN EFFECTIVELY REDUCE BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS' COGNITIVE COMPLAINTS AND PROMPT FURTHER RESEARCH ON MIND-BODY AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY INTERVENTIONS FOR IMPROVING CANCER-RELATED COGNITIVE PROBLEMS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
15 2382  34 YOCAS(C)(R) YOGA REDUCES SELF-REPORTED MEMORY DIFFICULTY IN CANCER SURVIVORS IN A NATIONWIDE RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL: INVESTIGATING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MEMORY AND SLEEP. UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND INTERVENTIONS ARE NEEDED TO ALLEVIATE MEMORY DIFFICULTY IN CANCER SURVIVORS. WE PREVIOUSLY SHOWED IN A PHASE III RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL THAT YOCAS(C)(R) YOGA-A PROGRAM THAT CONSISTS OF BREATHING EXERCISES, POSTURES, AND MEDITATION-SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED SLEEP QUALITY IN CANCER SURVIVORS. THIS STUDY ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF YOCAS(C)(R) ON MEMORY AND IDENTIFIED RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MEMORY AND SLEEP. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: SURVIVORS WERE RANDOMIZED TO STANDARD CARE (SC) OR SC WITH YOCAS(C)(R) . 328 PARTICIPANTS WHO PROVIDED DATA ON THE MEMORY DIFFICULTY ITEM OF THE MD ANDERSON SYMPTOM INVENTORY ARE INCLUDED. SLEEP QUALITY WAS MEASURED USING THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX. GENERAL LINEAR MODELING (GLM) DETERMINED THE GROUP EFFECT OF YOCAS(C)(R) ON MEMORY DIFFICULTY COMPARED WITH SC. GLM ALSO DETERMINED MODERATION OF BASELINE MEMORY DIFFICULTY ON POSTINTERVENTION SLEEP AND VICE VERSA. PATH MODELING ASSESSED THE MEDIATING EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN MEMORY DIFFICULTY ON YOCAS(C)(R) CHANGES IN SLEEP AND VICE VERSA. RESULTS: YOCAS(C)(R) SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED MEMORY DIFFICULTY AT POSTINTERVENTION COMPARED WITH SC (MEAN CHANGE: YOGA=-0.60; SC=-0.16; P<.05). BASELINE MEMORY DIFFICULTY DID NOT MODERATE THE EFFECTS OF POSTINTERVENTION SLEEP QUALITY IN YOCAS(C)(R) COMPARED WITH SC. BASELINE SLEEP QUALITY DID MODERATE THE EFFECTS OF POSTINTERVENTION MEMORY DIFFICULTY IN YOCAS(C)(R) COMPARED WITH SC (P<.05). CHANGES IN SLEEP QUALITY WAS A SIGNIFICANT MEDIATOR OF REDUCED MEMORY DIFFICULTY IN YOCAS(C)(R) COMPARED WITH SC (P<.05); HOWEVER, CHANGES IN MEMORY DIFFICULTY DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY MEDIATE IMPROVED SLEEP QUALITY IN YOCAS(C)(R) COMPARED WITH SC. CONCLUSIONS: IN THIS LARGE NATIONWIDE TRIAL, YOCAS(C)(R) YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED PATIENT-REPORTED MEMORY DIFFICULTY IN CANCER SURVIVORS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                               
16 2729  44 YOGA OF AWARENESS PROGRAM FOR MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS: RESULTS FROM A RANDOMIZED TRIAL. GOAL OF WORK: BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS HAVE LIMITED OPTIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF HOT FLASHES AND RELATED SYMPTOMS. FURTHER, THERAPIES WIDELY USED TO PREVENT RECURRENCE IN SURVIVORS, SUCH AS TAMOXIFEN, TEND TO INDUCE OR EXACERBATE MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS. THE AIM OF THIS PRELIMINARY, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA INTERVENTION ON MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS IN A SAMPLE OF SURVIVORS OF EARLY-STAGE BREAST CANCER (STAGES IA-IIB). MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIRTY-SEVEN DISEASE-FREE WOMEN EXPERIENCING HOT FLASHES WERE RANDOMIZED TO THE 8-WEEK YOGA OF AWARENESS PROGRAM (GENTLE YOGA POSES, MEDITATION, AND BREATHING EXERCISES) OR TO WAIT-LIST CONTROL. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS DAILY REPORTS OF HOT FLASHES COLLECTED AT BASELINE, POSTTREATMENT, AND 3 MONTHS AFTER TREATMENT VIA AN INTERACTIVE TELEPHONE SYSTEM. DATA WERE ANALYZED BY INTENTION TO TREAT. MAIN RESULTS: AT POSTTREATMENT, WOMEN WHO RECEIVED THE YOGA PROGRAM SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENTS RELATIVE TO THE CONTROL CONDITION IN HOT-FLASH FREQUENCY, SEVERITY, AND TOTAL SCORES AND IN LEVELS OF JOINT PAIN, FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, SYMPTOM-RELATED BOTHER, AND VIGOR. AT 3 MONTHS FOLLOW-UP, PATIENTS MAINTAINED THEIR TREATMENT GAINS IN HOT FLASHES, JOINT PAIN, FATIGUE, SYMPTOM-RELATED BOTHER, AND VIGOR AND SHOWED ADDITIONAL SIGNIFICANT GAINS IN NEGATIVE MOOD, RELAXATION, AND ACCEPTANCE. CONCLUSIONS: THIS PILOT STUDY PROVIDES PROMISING SUPPORT FOR THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF A COMPREHENSIVE YOGA PROGRAM FOR HOT FLASHES AND OTHER MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS IN EARLY-STAGE BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
17 1714  35 PERCEIVED HEALTH BENEFITS FROM YOGA AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO DESCRIBE THE HEALTH BENEFITS REPORTED BY BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS FOLLOWING AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. DESIGN: THIS PHENOMENOLOGICAL STUDY EMPLOYED THREE FOCUS GROUPS WITH SIX BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS EACH (N = 18) FOLLOWING THE YOGA INTERVENTION. SETTING: THE FOCUS GROUPS AND YOGA CLASSES WERE CONDUCTED IN A LARGE HOSPITAL IN A MIDSIZED TOWN IN THE MIDWEST. SUBJECTS: EIGHTEEN FEMALE BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WHO WERE AT LEAST 9 MONTHS POSTTREATMENT PARTICIPATED IN THE FOCUS GROUPS FOLLOWING THE 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. INTERVENTION: AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS POPULATION WAS LED BY A YOGA THERAPIST. MEASURES: A SEMISTRUCTURED INTERVIEW GUIDE WAS UTILIZED TO GUIDE EACH FOCUS GROUP. ANALYSIS: INTERPRETATIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL ANALYSIS METHODS WERE EMPLOYED TO EXPLORE BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS' EXPERIENCES AFTER PARTICIPATING IN AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. RESULTS: THE FINDINGS REVEALED THAT THE WOMEN IN THE STUDY FOUND HEALTH PROMOTING BENEFITS IN THE AREAS OF PHYSICAL HEALTH AND HEALING, MENTAL HEALTH AND HEALING, AND SOCIAL HEALTH AND HEALING. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA MAY BE AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN THE HEALING PROCESS FOR BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
18 2627  26 YOGA FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF CANCER TREATMENT-RELATED TOXICITIES. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: TO (1) EXPLAIN WHAT YOGA IS, (2) SUMMARIZE PUBLISHED LITERATURE ON THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR MANAGING CANCER TREATMENT-RELATED TOXICITIES, (3) PROVIDE CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE USE OF YOGA FOR ONCOLOGY PROFESSIONALS, AND (4) SUGGEST PROMISING AREAS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. RECENT FINDINGS: BASED ON A TOTAL OF 24 PHASE II AND ONE PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS, LOW-INTENSITY FORMS OF YOGA, SPECIFICALLY GENTLE HATHA AND RESTORATIVE, ARE FEASIBLE, SAFE, AND EFFECTIVE FOR TREATING SLEEP DISRUPTION, CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, PSYCHOSOCIAL DISTRESS, AND MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS IN CANCER PATIENTS RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIATION AND CANCER SURVIVORS. CLINICIANS SHOULD CONSIDER PRESCRIBING YOGA FOR THEIR PATIENTS SUFFERING WITH THESE TOXICITIES BY REFERRING THEM TO QUALIFIED YOGA PROFESSIONALS. MORE DEFINITIVE PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE FINDINGS AND TO INVESTIGATE OTHER TYPES, DOSES, AND DELIVERY MODES OF YOGA FOR TREATING CANCER-RELATED TOXICITIES IN PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
19 1780  38 PREDICTORS OF ADHERENCE TO AN IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. CONTEXT: DESPITE THE KNOWN HEALTH BENEFITS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, PARTICIPATION RATES IN CANCER SURVIVOR GROUPS REMAIN LOW. RESEARCHERS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO IDENTIFY ALTERNATIVE MODES OF NONTRADITIONAL PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES THAT MAY INCREASE PARTICIPATION AND ADHERENCE RATES. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE DETERMINANTS OF YOGA IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. AIM: TO EXAMINE PREDICTORS OF IYENGAR YOGA ADHERENCE IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS USING THE THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOUR. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: CLASSES WERE HELD EITHER IN CAMPUS RECREATION FACILITIES OR AT THE BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE FITNESS CENTER AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA IN EDMONTON, CANADA. THE STUDY WAS AN EVALUATION OF AN EXISTING YOGA PROGRAM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TWENTY-THREE POST ADJUVANT THERAPY BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS PARTICIPATING IN A COMMUNITY-BASED, TWICE WEEKLY, 12 WEEK IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM WERE ASKED TO COMPLETE BASELINE MEASURES OF THE THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOR, DEMOGRAPHIC, MEDICAL, HEALTH/FITNESS, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL VARIABLES. ADHERENCE WAS MEASURED BY OBJECTIVE ATTENDANCE TO THE CLASSES. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: WE ANALYZED UNIVARIATE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN PREDICTORS AND YOGA ADHERENCE WITH INDEPENDENT T-TESTS. RESULTS: ADHERENCE TO THE IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM WAS 63.9% AND WAS PREDICTED BY STRONGER INTENTION (P<0.001), GREATER SELF-EFFICACY (P=0.003), MORE POSITIVE INSTRUMENTAL ATTITUDE (PS=0.025), HIGHER DISEASE STAGE (P=0.018), YOGA EXPERIENCE IN THE PAST YEAR, (P=0.044), DIAGNOSIS OF A SECOND CANCER (P=0.008), LOWER FATIGUE (P=0.037), AND GREATER HAPPINESS (P=0.023). CONCLUSIONS: ADHERENCE TO IYENGAR YOGA IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WAS STRONGLY RELATED TO MOTIVATIONAL VARIABLES FROM THE THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOUR. RESEARCHERS ATTEMPTING TO IMPROVE YOGA ADHERENCE IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS MAY BENEFIT FROM TARGETING THE KEY CONSTRUCTS IN THE THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOUR.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
20 1900  47 RESTORATIVE YOGA FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER: FINDINGS FROM A RANDOMIZED PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVES: RESTORATIVE YOGA (RY) IS A GENTLE TYPE OF YOGA THAT MAY BE BENEFICIAL FOR CANCER PATIENTS AND POST-TREATMENT SURVIVORS. STUDY GOALS WERE: TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING A RY INTERVENTION FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER; AND TO EXAMINE GROUP DIFFERENCES IN SELF-REPORTED EMOTIONAL, HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, AND SYMPTOM OUTCOMES. METHODS: WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER (N=44; MEAN AGE 55.8 YEARS) ENROLLED IN THIS STUDY; 34% WERE ACTIVELY UNDERGOING CANCER TREATMENT. STUDY PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO THE INTERVENTION (10 WEEKLY 75-MINUTE RY CLASSES) OR A WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES AT WEEK 0 (BASELINE) AND WEEK 10 (IMMEDIATELY POST-INTERVENTION FOR THE YOGA GROUP). RESULTS: GROUP DIFFERENCES FAVORING THE YOGA GROUP WERE SEEN FOR MENTAL HEALTH, DEPRESSION, POSITIVE AFFECT, AND SPIRITUALITY (PEACE/MEANING). SIGNIFICANT BASELINE*GROUP INTERACTIONS WERE OBSERVED FOR NEGATIVE AFFECT AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING. WOMEN WITH HIGHER NEGATIVE AFFECT AND LOWER EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING AT BASELINE DERIVED GREATER BENEFIT FROM THE YOGA INTERVENTION COMPARED TO THOSE WITH SIMILAR VALUES AT BASELINE IN THE CONTROL GROUP. THE YOGA GROUP DEMONSTRATED A SIGNIFICANT WITHIN-GROUP IMPROVEMENT IN FATIGUE; NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS NOTED FOR THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: ALTHOUGH LIMITED BY SAMPLE SIZE, THESE PILOT DATA SUGGEST POTENTIAL BENEFIT OF RY ON EMOTIONAL OUTCOMES AND FATIGUE IN CANCER PATIENTS. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT A RY INTERVENTION IS FEASIBLE FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER; IMPLICATIONS FOR STUDY DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION ARE NOTED WITH AN EMPHASIS ON PROGRAM ADOPTION AND PARTICIPANT ADHERENCE.	2009

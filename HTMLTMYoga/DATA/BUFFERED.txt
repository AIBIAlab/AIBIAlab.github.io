1 1648 87 MOVING OUT OF YOUR MIND AND INTO YOUR BODY: YOGA BUFFERS THE EFFECTS OF CHILDHOOD MALTREATMENT ON PTSD SYMPTOMS. OBJECTIVE: CHILDHOOD MALTREATMENT HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY LINKED TO POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) SYMPTOMS AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS AND YOGA MAY BUFFER THE EFFECTS. THE CURRENT STUDY EXAMINED THE FREQUENCY OF COLLEGE STUDENT'S YOGA PRACTICE OVER THE PAST YEAR AS A MODERATOR OF CHILDHOOD MALTREATMENT AND PTSD SYMPTOMS IN THE PAST 30 DAYS. PARTICIPANTS: A SAMPLE OF 177 COLLEGE STUDENTS FROM A SOUTHERN UNIVERSITY. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS COMPETED AN ONLINE SURVEY IN EXCHANGE FOR EXTRA CREDIT OR ENTRY INTO A GIFT CARD RAFFLE. RESULTS: MODERATION ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT A MORE FREQUENT YOGA PRACTICE BUFFERED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MALTREATMENT AND PTSD SYMPTOMS. CONCLUSION: CLINICIANS WORKING WITH COLLEGE STUDENTS WITH A HISTORY OF MALTREATMENT ARE ENCOURAGED TO MAKE REFERRALS TO YOGA CLASSES. UNIVERSITIES ARE ENCOURAGED TO ADOPT TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA PROGRAMS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
2 1980 25 SLEEP MODERATES THE EFFECTS OF TIBETAN YOGA FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY. THIS STUDY EXAMINED SELF-REPORTED AND ACTIGRAPHY-ASSESSED SLEEP AND DEPRESSION AS MODERATORS OF THE EFFECT OF A TIBETAN YOGA INTERVENTION ON SLEEP AND DEPRESSION AMONG WOMEN UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY FOR BREAST CANCER. THIS IS A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF AN RCT EXAMINING A 4-SESSION TIBETAN YOGA PROGRAM (TYP; N = 74) VERSUS STRETCHING PROGRAM (STP; N = 68) OR USUAL CARE (UC; N = 85) ON SELF-REPORTED SLEEP (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI), ACTIGRAPHY-ASSESSED SLEEP EFFICIENCY (SE)) AND DEPRESSION (CENTERS FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES DEPRESSION SCALE; CES-D) FOR WOMEN UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY FOR BREAST CANCER. DATA WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE AND 1-WEEK AND 3-MONTH POST-INTERVENTION. BASELINE PSQI, ACTIGRAPHY-SE, AND CES-D WERE EXAMINED AS MODERATORS OF THE EFFECT OF GROUP ON PSQI, ACTIGRAPHY-SE, AND CES-D 1 WEEK AND 3 MONTHS AFTER TREATMENT. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT BASELINE ACTIGRAPHY-SE X GROUP EFFECT ON PSQI AT 1 WEEK (P < .001) AND 3 MONTHS (P = .002) AND ON CES-D AT 3 MONTHS (P = .049). SPECIFICALLY, THE NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION OF BASELINE ACTIGRAPHY-SE WITH SUBSEQUENT PSQI AND CES-D WAS BUFFERED FOR WOMEN IN THE TYP AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT IN STP, COMPARED TO THOSE IN THE UC. BASELINE PSQI AND CES-D WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT MODERATORS OF THE EFFECT OF GROUP ON ANY OUTCOME. BEHAVIORALLY ASSESSED SLEEP MAY BE A MORE ROBUST INDICATOR OF WHICH PATIENTS ARE MOST APPROPRIATE FOR A YOGA INTERVENTION THAN SELF-REPORTED SLEEP QUALITY. WOMEN WITH POOR SLEEP EFFICIENCY MAY DERIVE THE GREATEST BENEFIT IN TERMS OF SLEEP QUALITY AND MOOD FROM A YOGA INTERVENTION.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
3 1866 21 RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF TIBETAN YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY. BACKGROUND: THE CURRENT RANDOMIZED TRIAL EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF A TIBETAN YOGA PROGRAM (TYP) VERSUS A STRETCHING PROGRAM (STP) AND USUAL CARE (UC) ON SLEEP AND FATIGUE IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER WHO WERE UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY. METHODS: WOMEN WITH STAGE (AMERICAN JOINT COMMITTEE ON CANCER (AJCC) TNM) I TO III BREAST CANCER WHO WERE UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY WERE RANDOMIZED TO TYP (74 WOMEN), STP (68 WOMEN), OR UC (85 WOMEN). PARTICIPANTS IN THE TYP AND STP GROUPS PARTICIPATED IN 4 SESSIONS DURING CHEMOTHERAPY, FOLLOWED BY 3 BOOSTER SESSIONS OVER THE SUBSEQUENT 6 MONTHS, AND WERE ENCOURAGED TO PRACTICE AT HOME. SELF-REPORT MEASURES OF SLEEP DISTURBANCES (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX), FATIGUE (BRIEF FATIGUE INVENTORY), AND ACTIGRAPHY WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE; 1 WEEK AFTER TREATMENT; AND AT 3, 6, AND 12 MONTHS. RESULTS: THERE WERE NO GROUP DIFFERENCES NOTED IN TOTAL SLEEP DISTURBANCES OR FATIGUE LEVELS OVER TIME. HOWEVER, PATIENTS IN THE TYP GROUP REPORTED FEWER DAILY DISTURBANCES 1 WEEK AFTER TREATMENT COMPARED WITH THOSE IN THE STP (DIFFERENCE, -0.43; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [95% CI], -0.82 TO -0.04 [P = .03]) AND UC (DIFFERENCE, -0.41; 95% CI, -0.77 TO -0.05 [P = .02]) GROUPS. GROUP DIFFERENCES AT THE OTHER TIME POINTS WERE MAINTAINED FOR TYP VERSUS STP. ACTIGRAPHY DATA REVEALED GREATER MINUTES AWAKE AFTER SLEEP ONSET FOR PATIENTS IN THE STP GROUP 1 WEEK AFTER TREATMENT VERSUS THOSE IN THE TYP (DIFFERENCE, 15.36; 95% CI, 7.25-23.48 [P = .0003]) AND UC (DIFFERENCE, 14.48; 95% CI, 7.09-21.87 [P = .0002]) GROUPS. PATIENTS IN THE TYP GROUP WHO PRACTICED AT LEAST 2 TIMES A WEEK DURING FOLLOW-UP REPORTED BETTER PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX AND ACTIGRAPHY OUTCOMES AT 3 MONTHS AND 6 MONTHS AFTER TREATMENT COMPARED WITH THOSE WHO DID NOT AND BETTER OUTCOMES COMPARED WITH THOSE IN THE UC GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: PARTICIPATING IN TYP DURING CHEMOTHERAPY RESULTED IN MODEST SHORT-TERM BENEFITS IN SLEEP QUALITY, WITH LONG-TERM BENEFITS EMERGING OVER TIME FOR THOSE WHO PRACTICED TYP AT LEAST 2 TIMES A WEEK.

4  261 20 ACUTE AND CHRONIC EFFECTS OF TANTRIC YOGA PRACTICE ON DISTRESS INDEX. OBJECTIVES: TO EVALUATE THE ACUTE AND CHRONIC EFFECTS OF YOGA PRACTICE. DESIGN: QUANTITATIVE STUDY USING A ONE-GROUP PRE-POSTTEST DESIGN. SETTING: VISAO FUTURO INSTITUTE, PORANGABA, SAO PAULO, BRAZIL. PARTICIPANTS: 22 VOLUNTEERS (7 MEN AND 15 WOMEN). INTERVENTION: SIX WEEKS OF A TANTRIC YOGA PROGRAM (TYP), 50 MINUTES PER SESSION, HELD TWICE A WEEK FROM 8 A.M. TO 9 A.M. THE LOCAL ETHICS COMMITTEE APPROVED THE PROTOCOL. OUTCOME MEASURES: DATA WERE COLLECTED IN THE FIRST WEEK AND AT THE END OF THE SIXTH WEEK OF TYP. SALIVARY CORTISOL CONCENTRATION (SCC) WAS USED TO MEASURE PHYSIOLOGY OF DISTRESS AND TO ANALYZE THE SHORT- AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF TYP. PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS WAS EVALUATED BY APPLYING A SPECIFIC PERCEIVED STRESS QUESTIONNAIRE (PSQ). RESULTS (MEAN+/-STANDARD DEVIATION) WERE ANALYZED BY WILCOXON TEST (P<0.05). RESULTS: SCC DECREASED 24% AFTER THE FIRST (0.66+/-0.20 MUG/DL VERSUS 0.50+/-0.13 MUG/DL) AND LAST (1.01+/-0.37 VERSUS 0.76+/-0.31 MUG/DL) SESSIONS, SHOWING THE SHORT-TERM EFFECT OF YOGA. LONG-TERM EFFECTS WERE ANALYZED BY DAILY RHYTHM OF CORTISOL PRODUCTION. IN THE BEGINNING, VOLUNTEERS SHOWED ALTERED SCC DURING THE DAY, WITH NIGHTTIME VALUES (0.42+/-0.28) HIGHER THAN THOSE AT NOON (0.30+/-0.06). AFTER THE TYP, SCC WAS HIGHER IN THE MORNING (1.01+/-0.37) AND DECREASED DURING THE DAY, WITH LOWER VALUES BEFORE SLEEP (0.30+/-0.13). THE TYP WAS ALSO EFFICIENT TO REDUCE PSQ SCORES (0.45+/-0.13 VERSUS 0.39+/-0.07). SPECIFICALLY, THE IRRITABILITY, TENSION, AND FATIGUE DOMAINS ON THE PSQ DECREASED (0.60+/-0.20 VERSUS 0.46+/-0.13), AS DID THE FEAR AND ANXIETY DOMAINS (0.54+/-0.30 VERSUS 0.30+/-0.20). CONCLUSION: OVER THE SHORT TERM, TYP LED TO THE DECREASE OF CORTISOL PRODUCTION. OVER THE LONG TERM, TYP INDUCED HIGHER CORTISOL PRODUCTION IN THE MORNING AND LOWER PRODUCTION IN THE EVENING. THOSE EFFECTS CONTRIBUTED TO THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WELL-BEING OF THE PARTICIPANTS.	2015

6 2595 27 YOGA FOR MILITARY SERVICE PERSONNEL WITH PTSD: A SINGLE ARM STUDY. THIS STUDY EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) SYMPTOMS, RESILIENCE, AND MINDFULNESS IN MILITARY PERSONNEL. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETING THE YOGA INTERVENTION WERE 12 CURRENT OR FORMER MILITARY PERSONNEL WHO MET THE DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL FOR MENTAL DISORDERS-FOURTH EDITION-TEXT REVISION (DSM-IV-TR) DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR PTSD. RESULTS WERE ALSO BENCHMARKED AGAINST OTHER MILITARY INTERVENTION STUDIES OF PTSD USING THE CLINICIAN ADMINISTERED PTSD SCALE (CAPS; BLAKE ET AL., 2000) AS AN OUTCOME MEASURE. RESULTS OF WITHIN-SUBJECT ANALYSES SUPPORTED THE STUDY'S PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS THAT YOGA WOULD REDUCE PTSD SYMPTOMS (D = 0.768; T = 2.822; P = .009) BUT DID NOT SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT YOGA WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE MINDFULNESS (D = 0.392; T = -0.9500; P = .181) AND RESILIENCE (D = 0.270; T = -1.220; P = .124) IN THIS POPULATION. BENCHMARKING RESULTS INDICATED THAT, AS COMPARED WITH THE AGGREGATED TREATMENT BENCHMARK (D = 1.074) OBTAINED FROM PUBLISHED CLINICAL TRIALS, THE CURRENT STUDY'S TREATMENT EFFECT (D = 0.768) WAS VISIBLY LOWER, AND COMPARED WITH THE WAITLIST CONTROL BENCHMARK (D = 0.156), THE TREATMENT EFFECT IN THE CURRENT STUDY WAS VISIBLY HIGHER.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
7 1517 22 IS YOGA ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED SLEEP AMONGST BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS? BACKGROUND: BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS MAY EXPERIENCE SLEEP DISTURBANCES THAT CAN AFFECT THEIR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WELL-BEING. WE SOUGHT TO DETERMINE THE ASSOCIATION, IF ANY, BETWEEN YOGA AND SLEEP AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS IN A POPULATION-BASED COHORT. METHODS: THE NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY IS DESIGNED TO BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE US CIVILIAN NON-INSTITUTIONALIZED POPULATION. WE EVALUATED BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS IN THE 2017 COHORT TO DETERMINE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN YOGA AND SELF-REPORTED QUALITY OF SLEEP. RESULTS: OF THE 25,905 PEOPLE SURVEYED, REPRESENTING 238,738,039 IN THE POPULATION, 1.59% REPORTED A PREVIOUS HISTORY OF BREAST CANCER. BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WERE LESS LIKELY TO REPORT HAVING PRACTICED YOGA IN THE PRECEDING 12 MONTHS, COMPARED TO THOSE WITHOUT A HISTORY OF BREAST CANCER (9.98% VS 13.78%, P = .011). IN ADDITION, THEY WERE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT HAVING HAD TROUBLE FALLING ASLEEP (44.64% VS 36.32%, P = .002), STAYING ASLEEP (53.72% VS 39.43%, P < .001), AND USING SLEEP MEDICATION ON AT LEAST 1 DAY WITHIN THE PREVIOUS WEEK (23.80% VS 13.49%, P < .001) THAN THOSE WITHOUT BREAST CANCER. AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN DIFFICULTY FALLING ASLEEP (39.16% VS 44.98%, P = .482), DIFFICULTY STAYING ASLEEP (61.17% VS 52.70%, P = .305), AND NEEDING SLEEP MEDICATION (19.03% VS 24.53%, P = .395) BETWEEN THOSE WHO PRACTICED YOGA AND THOSE WHO DID NOT. CONTROLLING FOR SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS, THERE REMAINED NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN YOGA AND DIFFICULTY FALLING OR STAYING ASLEEP AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. CONCLUSION: THERE IS NO DIRECT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN YOGA AND SLEEP QUALITY IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
8 2809 13 YOGA THERAPY: BUILDING A HOLDING ENVIRONMENT FOR SOMATIC AND PSYCHE CHANGE. DRAWING ON IDEAS FROM D.W. WINNICOTT AND THE WORK OF QUAKER THEOLOGIAN PARKER PALMER, THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE CONCEPT OF A HOLDING ENVIRONMENT, ITS REFINED UNDERSTANDING IN THE LITERATURE OVER THE YEARS, AND HOW IT CAN BE OPTIMALLY USED IN YOGA THERAPY. THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT EFFECTIVELY ESTABLISHING A HOLDING ENVIRONMENT CAN FACILITATE BOTH SOMATIC AND DEEP STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN A CLIENT, FACILITATING HEALING FROM PRIMAL WOUNDING AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL RECONNECTION TO THE TRUE SELF.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
9 1433 17 IMPROVING THE DEGREE OF PUBIC ARCH POST-YOGA EXERCISE DURING PREGNANCY. YOGA EXERCISES UNDERTAKEN DURING THE MATERNITY PERIOD MAY REDUCE UNPLEASANT SYMPTOMS DURING PREGNANCY AND REDUCE DELIVERY PAIN. FLEXIBILITY OF THE HIP JOINT IMPROVES THE DEGREE OF PUBIC ARCH CREATED IN AN OPEN-LEG POSTURE AND WIDENS THE PELVIC OUTLET REGION, SHORTENING THE TIME REQUIRED FOR DELIVERY AND FACILITATING EASY DELIVERY. THE DEGREE OF PUBIC ARCH IS RELATED TO THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE HIP JOINT. ALTHOUGH MANY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THE EFFECT OF YOGA EXERCISE DURING PREGNANCY, THE EFFECT ON THE DEGREE OF THE PUBIC ARCH HAS NOT BEEN ELUCIDATED. TO ELUCIDATE WHETHER THE DEGREE OF THE PUBIC ARCH IS IMPROVED BY YOGA EXERCISE DURING PREGNANCY, THIS STUDY ENROLLED 177 PREGNANT SUBJECTS. THE DEGREE OF PUBIC ARCH PRE- AND POST-YOGA EXERCISE WAS MEASURED USING INSTRUMENTS IN AN OPEN-LEG POSTURE (SEATED WITH FEMURS ABDUCTED). THE MEAN PUBIC ARCH PRE- AND POST-YOGA WAS 122.61 AND 127.93 DEGREES, RESPECTIVELY. THE DEGREE OF PUBIC ARCH POST-YOGA SESSIONS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED COMPARED WITH PRE-YOGA SESSIONS (P < 0.01). THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT YOGA EXERCISES DURING THE PREGNANCY PERIOD APPEAR TO IMPROVE THE DEGREE OF PUBIC ARCH.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
10  533 15 COMPARISON OF TWO TAGTEACH ERROR-CORRECTION PROCEDURES TO TEACH BEGINNER YOGA POSES TO ADULTS. TEACHING WITH ACOUSTICAL GUIDANCE INVOLVES AUDITORY FEEDBACK (E.G., A CLICK SOUND WHEN A DESIRED BEHAVIOR OCCURS) AS PART OF A MULTICOMPONENT INTERVENTION KNOWN AS TAGTEACH. TAGTEACH HAS BEEN FOUND TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE IN SPORT, DANCE, SURGICAL TECHNIQUE, AND WALKING. WE COMPARED THE EFFICACY AND EFFICIENCY OF THE STANDARD TAGTEACH ERROR-CORRECTION PROCEDURE AND A MODIFIED TAGTEACH ERROR-CORRECTION PROCEDURE TO TEACH 4 NOVICE ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS BEGINNER YOGA POSES. BOTH ERROR-CORRECTION PROCEDURES WERE EFFECTIVE FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS; HOWEVER, THE RELATIVE EFFICIENCY OF THESE ERROR-CORRECTION PROCEDURES WAS UNCLEAR. RESULTS ARE DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF LIMITATIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
11 1229 22 FEASIBILITY AND IMPACT OF AN 8-WEEK INTEGRATIVE YOGA PROGRAM IN PEOPLE WITH MODERATE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS-RELATED DISABILITY: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: THIS PILOT STUDY DETERMINED THE FEASIBILITY OF A SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED 8-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE WITH MODERATE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS)-RELATED DISABILITY. WE EXPLORED THE PROGRAM'S EFFECT ON QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AND PHYSICAL AND MENTAL PERFORMANCE. METHODS: WE USED A SINGLE-GROUP DESIGN WITH REPEATED MEASUREMENTS AT BASELINE, POSTINTERVENTION, AND 8-WEEK FOLLOW-UP. FEASIBILITY WAS EXAMINED THROUGH COST, RECRUITMENT, RETENTION, ATTENDANCE, AND SAFETY. OUTCOMES INCLUDED THE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS QUALITY OF LIFE INVENTORY (MSQLI), 12-ITEM MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS WALKING SCALE (MSWS-12), TIMED 25-FOOT WALK TEST (T25FW), 6-MINUTE WALK TEST (6MWT), NINE-HOLE PEG TEST (NHPT), FIVE-TIMES SIT-TO-STAND TEST (FTSTS), MULTIDIRECTIONAL REACH TEST (MDRT), MAXIMUM EXPIRATORY PRESSURE, AND PACED AUDITORY SERIAL ADDITION TEST-3'' (PASAT-3''). RESULTS: FOURTEEN PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE STUDY. THE PROGRAM WAS FEASIBLE. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT MAIN EFFECTS ON THE 36-ITEM SHORT FORM HEALTH STATUS SURVEY MENTAL COMPONENT SUMMARY (SF-36 MCS), MODIFIED FATIGUE IMPACT SCALE (MFIS), BLADDER CONTROL SCALE (BLCS), PERCEIVED DEFICITS QUESTIONNAIRE (PDQ), MENTAL HEALTH INVENTORY (MHI), MSWS-12, T25FW, NHPT, PASAT-3'', 6MWT, FTSTS, AND MDRT-BACK. IMPROVEMENTS WERE FOUND ON THE SF-36 MCS, MFIS, BLCS, PDQ, MHI, AND MSWS-12 BETWEEN BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION. THE EFFECT ON PDQ PERSISTED AT FOLLOW-UP. IMPROVEMENTS WERE FOUND ON THE T25FW, NHPT, 6MWT, FTSTS, AND MDRT-BACK BETWEEN BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION THAT PERSISTED AT FOLLOW-UP. THE PASAT-3'' DID NOT CHANGE BETWEEN BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION BUT DID BETWEEN POSTINTERVENTION AND FOLLOW-UP. CONCLUSIONS: THE YOGA PROGRAM WAS SAFE AND FEASIBLE. IMPROVEMENTS IN CERTAIN MEASURES OF QOL AND PERFORMANCE WERE SEEN AT POSTINTERVENTION AND FOLLOW-UP.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
12 2164 23 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND SELF-ESTEEM ON MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS-A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS FOUND THAT YOGA CAN ENHANCE QUALITY OF LIFE AND EASE MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. THE STUDY EXAMINED WHETHER SELF-ESTEEM MEDIATED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE, FATIGUE AND MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS, UTILIZING VALIDATED OUTCOME MEASURES. STUDY DESIGN: THIS IS A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA WITH THOSE OF USUAL CARE IN 40 BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WHO SUFFERED FROM MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS. ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED ALL 3 ASSESSMENTS (WEEK 0, WEEK 12, AND WEEK 24) AND PROVIDED FULL DATA. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: OUTCOMES WERE MEASURED USING SELF-RATING INSTRUMENTS. MEDIATION ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED USING SPSS. RESULTS: SELF-ESTEEM MEDIATED THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON TOTAL MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS (B=-2.11, 95% BCI [-5.40 TO -0.37]), PSYCHOLOGICAL MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS (B=-0.94, 95% BCI [-2.30 TO -0.01]), AND UROGENITAL MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS (B=-0.66, 95% BCI [-1.65 TO -0.15]), QUALITY OF LIFE (B=8.04, 95% BCI [3.15-17.03]), SOCIAL WELL-BEING (B=1.80, 95% BCI [0.54-4.21]), EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING (B=1.62, 95% BCI [0.70-3.34]), FUNCTIONAL WELL-BEING (B=1.84, 95% BCI [0.59-4.13]), AND FATIGUE (B=4.34, 95% BCI [1.28-9.55]). SELF-ESTEEM HAD NO EFFECT ON SOMATOVEGETATIVE MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS (B=-0.50, 95% BCI N.S.) OR ON PHYSICAL WELL-BEING (B=0.79, 95% BCI N.S.). CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS SUPPORT THE ASSUMPTION THAT SELF-ESTEEM PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF YOGA AND THAT YOGA CAN HAVE LONG-TERM BENEFITS FOR WOMEN DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER AND UNDERGOING MENOPAUSAL TRANSITION.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
13 1536 16 KETAMINE, TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION, AND DEPRESSION SPECIFIC YOGA AND MINDFULNESS BASED COGNITIVE THERAPY IN MANAGEMENT OF TREATMENT RESISTANT DEPRESSION: REVIEW AND SOME DATA ON EFFICACY. DEPRESSION AFFECTS ABOUT 121 MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE AND PREVALENCE OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD) IN US ADULTS IS 6.4%. TREATMENT RESISTANT DEPRESSION (TRD) ACCOUNTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 12-20% OF ALL DEPRESSION PATIENTS AND COSTS $29-$48 BILLION ANNUALLY. KETAMINE AND REPETITIVE TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION (RTMS) HAVE USEFUL ROLES IN TRD, BUT THEIR UTILITY IN LONG TERM IS UNKNOWN. AS PER THE LATEST LITERATURE, THE INTERVENTIONS USING YOGA AND MEDITATION INCLUDING THE MINDFULNESS BASED COGNITIVE THERAPY (MBCT) HAVE BEEN USEFUL IN TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION AND RELAPSE PREVENTION. WE PRESENT A REVIEW OF RTMS, KETAMINE, AND MBCT AND ALSO REPORT EFFICACY OF A DEPRESSION SPECIFIC, INNOVATIVE, AND TRANSLATIONAL MODEL OF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS BASED COGNITIVE THERAPY (DEPS Y-MBCT), DEVELOPED BY THE FIRST AUTHOR. DEPS Y-MBCT AS AN ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT SUCCESSFULLY AMELIORATED TRD SYMPTOMS IN 27/32 PATIENTS IN AN OPEN LABEL PILOT TRIAL IN TRD PATIENTS. CONSIDERING THE LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING TREATMENT OPTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE OF KETAMINE AND RTMS WHEN USED AS THE SOLE MODALITY OF TREATMENT, WE SUGGEST A "TIERED APPROACH FOR TRD" BY COMBINING KETAMINE AND RTMS (ALONE OR ALONG WITH ANTIDEPRESSANTS) FOR RAPID REMISSION OF ACUTE DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AND TO USE DEPS Y-MBCT FOR MAINTAINING REMISSION AND PREVENTING RELAPSE.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
14 2893 24 YOGAMAN: AN INEXPENSIVE, ANATOMICALLY-DETAILED CHEST TUBE PLACEMENT TRAINER. INTRODUCTION: OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHEST TUBE PLACEMENT IN EMERGENCY MEDICINE TRAINING PROGRAMS HAVE DECREASED, MAKING COMPETENCE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE WITH LIVE PATIENTS PROBLEMATIC. AVAILABLE TRAINERS ARE EXPENSIVE AND MAY REQUIRE COSTLY MAINTENANCE. METHODS: WE CONSTRUCTED AN ANATOMICALLY-DETAILED MODEL USING A HALLOWEEN SKELETON THORAX, DRESS FORM TORSO, AND YOGA MAT. PARTICIPANTS IN A TRIAL SESSION COMPLETED A SURVEY REGARDING EITHER THEIR COMFORT WITH CHEST TUBE PLACEMENT BEFORE AND AFTER THE SESSION OR THE REALISM OF YOGAMAN VS. CADAVER LAB, DEPENDING ON WHETHER THEY HAD PLACED <10 OR 10 OR MORE CHEST TUBES IN LIVE PATIENTS. RESULTS: INEXPERIENCED PROVIDERS REPORTED AN IMPROVEMENT IN COMFORT AFTER WORKING WITH YOGAMAN, (COMFORT BEFORE 47 MILLIMETERS [MM] [INTERQUARTILE RATIO {IQR}, 20-53 MM]; COMFORT AFTER 75 MM [IQR, 39-80 MM], P=0.01). EXPERIENCED PROVIDERS RATED REALISM OF YOGAMAN AND CADAVER LAB SIMILARLY (YOGAMAN 79 MM [IQR, 74-83 MM]; CADAVER LAB 78 MM [IQR, 76-89 MM], P=0.67). ALL EVALUATORS EITHER AGREED OR STRONGLY AGREED THAT YOGAMAN WAS USEFUL FOR TEACHING CHEST TUBE PLACEMENT IN A RESIDENCY PROGRAM. CONCLUSION: OUR CHEST TUBE TRAINER ALLOWED FOR LANDMARK IDENTIFICATION, TISSUE DISSECTION, PLEURA PUNCTURE, LUNG PALPATION, AND TUBE SECURING. IT IMPROVED COMFORT OF INEXPERIENCED PROVIDERS AND WAS RATED SIMILARLY TO CADAVER LAB IN REALISM BY EXPERIENCED PROVIDERS. IT IS EASILY REUSABLE AND, AT $198, COSTS A FRACTION OF THE PRICE OF AVAILABLE COMMERCIAL TRAINERS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
15 1265 17 FLEXIBILITY-NOT JUST FOR YOGA ANYMORE! OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, NUCLEOSIDES HAVE MAINTAINED A PROMINENT ROLE AS ONE OF THE CORNERSTONES OF ANTIVIRAL AND ANTICANCER THERAPEUTICS, AND MANY APPROACHES TO NUCLEOSIDE DRUG DESIGN HAVE BEEN PURSUED. ONE SUCH APPROACH INVOLVES FLEXIBILITY IN THE SUGAR MOIETY OF NUCLEOSIDES, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL ANTI-HIV AND HBV DRUG TENOFOVIR. IN CONTRAST, INTRODUCTION OF FLEXIBILITY TO THE NUCLEOBASE SCAFFOLD HAS ONLY MORE RECENTLY GAINED SIGNIFICANCE WITH THE INVENTION OF OUR FLEXIMERS. THE HISTORY, DEVELOPMENT, AND SOME BIOLOGICAL RELEVANCE FOR THIS INNOVATIVE CLASS OF NUCLEOSIDES ARE DETAILED HEREIN.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
16 2498 17 YOGA AS SANCTUARY: A VALUABLE MIND-BODY INTERVENTION FOR THE LESBIAN COMMUNITY. POETIC AUTOETHNOGRAPHY PROVIDES A RESEARCH METHODOLOGY TO EXPLORE YOGA AS A MIND-BODY INTERVENTION THAT CREATES SANCTUARY. USING THIS QUALITATIVE METHOD AND RETRIEVING DATA FROM MY PERSONAL JOURNALS, DAILY WORKOUT JOURNALS, EXPERIENCES AS A LESBIAN-IDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT IN YOGA CLASSES, AND YOGA INSTRUCTOR, I TURN THE RESEARCH LENS ON MYSELF IN ORDER TO EXAMINE MY SOCIOLOGICAL LIFE STORY. AT A CRITICAL TIME IN MY LIFE WHEN I WAS STRUGGLING WITH THE FRAGMENTATION, ANXIETY, AND DESPAIR RESULTING FROM DEALING WITH HOMOPHOBIA IN A HETERONORMATIVE WORLD, YOGA PROVIDED SANCTUARY FOR ME. MY YOGA PRACTICE INCREASED MY SELF-EFFICACY, PROVIDING TRANSFERABLE TECHNIQUES FOR FINDING REFUGE WITHIN MYSELF, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE ADVERSITY I WAS FACING IN MY LIFE. PLACES OF SANCTUARY ARE CRITICAL FOR MEMBERS OF MINORITY GROUPS WHO OFTEN FACE MARGINALIZATION AND OPPRESSION, WHICH COMPROMISE THEIR WELL-BEING.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
17  409 22 BLENDING MARTIAL ARTS AND YOGA FOR HEALTH: FROM THE LAST SAMURAI TO THE FIRST ODAKA YOGA WARRIOR. THIS PAPER INTRODUCES THE CASE STUDY OF ODAKA YOGA, AN INNOVATIVE STYLE OF POSTURAL YOGA BLENDED WITH MARTIAL ARTS ELEMENTS WHICH EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF PRACTITIONERS' HEALTH AND PROCESSES OF SELF-TRANSFORMATION AS PIVOTAL TO THE SCHOOL'S ETHOS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE PAPER EXPLORES HOW ODAKA YOGA'S PHILOSOPHICAL BACKDROPS AND PRACTICAL REPERTOIRE, COMPOSED BY A MIXTURE OF "EXOTIC" RESOURCES SUCH AS BUSHIDO, ZEN, YOGA, AND A CONSTANT REFERENCE TO THE OCEAN WAVES AND BIOMECHANICS, CONSTITUTE A VERY SPECIFIC VISION OF HEALTH AT THE INTERSECTION OF WESTERN SCIENCE AND ESOTERIC KNOWLEDGE. THEORETICALLY, THE PAPER BORROWS FROM JENNINGS' THEORY OF MARTIAL CREATION AND ENRICHES IT WITH SOME OF THE CENTRAL ANALYTICAL TOOLS PROPOSED BY THEORISTS SUCH AS BOURDIEU AND FOUCAULT. METHODOLOGICALLY, IT RELIES ON A MULTIMODAL APPROACH INCLUDING DISCURSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE SCHOOL'S PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS, INTERVIEWS WITH THE FOUNDERS AND OTHER KEY TEACHERS, AND OBSERVANT PARTICIPATION OF PRACTITIONERS' APPRENTICESHIP PROCESSES. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE BIRTH OF ODAKA YOGA AS OCCURRING AT THE INTERSECTION OF ASIAN MARTIAL ARTS AND YOGA, AS WELL AS THE FOUNDERS' BIOGRAPHICAL TRAJECTORIES FROM THE WORLD OF COMPETITIVE MARTIAL ARTS AND FITNESS, TO YOGA; IT THEN TURNS TO AN EXAMINATION OF ODAKA YOGA'S CONCEPTION OF HEALTH AS A MIXTURE OF THE WESTERN BIOMEDICAL MODEL AND THE SUBTLE BODY MODEL OF ASIAN TRADITIONS SUCH AS YOGA AND MARTIAL ARTS. IT ARGUES THAT THE CONCEPTION OF HEALTH PROMOTED BY THIS SCHOOL GIVES RISE TO THE ODAKA YOGA WARRIOR, THE IDEAL-TYPICAL PRACTITIONER WHOSE BODY IS SIMULTANEOUSLY EXPOSED TO THE MEDICAL GAZE AND ITS IMPERATIVES OF CONTROL, KNOWLEDGE, AND MANIPULATION; WHILE IT ALSO DEIFIES IT, AS IT IS ANIMATED BY THE ELUSIVE FLOWS OF ENERGY (QI OR PRANA) THAT PROLONGED PRACTICE AIMS TO MASTER. THE PAPER CONCLUDES WITH A REFLECTION ON HYBRID CONCEPTIONS OF HEALTH AND THE UBIQUITOUS ROLE OF HEALTH DISCOURSES AND NARRATIVES ACROSS SOCIOCULTURAL DOMAINS.	2020	
                                                                       
18 2500 22 YOGA AS THE "NEXT WAVE" OF THERAPEUTIC MODALITIES FOR TREATMENT OF INSOMNIA. INSOMNIA RATES CONTINUE TO RISE, ESPECIALLY AMONG SPECIFIC POPULATIONS. CURRENT NONPHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENTS RELY PRIMARILY UPON COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR INSOMNIA (CBT-I), WHICH WAS INTRODUCED IN THE 1970S. NEWER TREATMENTS HAVE INCORPORATED CBT "THIRD WAVE" TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING MINDFULNESS AND ACCEPTANCE TECHNIQUES. YOGA PRACTICE IS WELL SUITED TO COMPLEMENT EXISTING THERAPIES AND TO ADDRESS SLEEP PROBLEMS IN A MORE HOLISTIC WAY. CURRENT THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL APPROACHES TO TREATING INSOMNIA ARE DISCUSSED, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON THE ROLE OF YOGA IN ADDRESSING PRECIPITATING AND PERPETUATING FACTORS IN INSOMNIA THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN LARGELY OVERLOOKED.AN ESTIMATED ONE-THIRD OF U.S. ADULTS SUFFER FROM INSOMNIA (CHEN, GELAYE, & WILLIAMS, 2013; MELLINGER, BALTER, & UHLENHUTH, 1985; OHAYON, 2002), AND THE PROBLEM APPEARS TO BE GROWING. WHILE TREATMENT FOR INSOMNIA HAS HELPED TO ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM FOR SOME (IRWIN, COLE, & NICASSIO, 2006; MORIN ET AL., 2009), PREVALENCE OF INSOMNIA IS ON THE RISE, ESPECIALLY AMONG CERTAIN GROUPS, INCLUDING ELDERLY AND MILITARY POPULATIONS (MORIN, 2009; MYSLIWIEC ET AL., 2013). RISING RATES OF INSOMNIA HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO CHANGES IN LIFESTYLE AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, INCLUDING INCREASED RELIANCE ON TECHNOLOGY AND DECREASED SYNCHRONY WITH NATURAL WAKE-SLEEP RHYTHMS (BRAHINSKY, 2013; WALLACE-GUY ET AL., 2002; YUN, BAZAR, GERBER, LEE, & DANIEL, 2005).	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
19 1614 16 MIND AND CONSCIOUSNESS IN YOGA - VEDANTA: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WITH WESTERN PSYCHOLOGICAL CONCEPTS. STUDY OF MIND AND CONSCIOUSNESS THROUGH ESTABLISHED SCIENTIFIC METHODS IS OFTEN DIFFICULT DUE TO THE OBSERVED-OBSERVER DICHOTOMY. CARTESIAN APPROACH OF DUALISM CONSIDERING THE MIND AND MATTER AS TWO DIVERSE AND UNCONNECTED ENTITIES HAS BEEN QUESTIONED BY ORIENTAL SCHOOLS OF YOGA AND VEDANTA AS WELL AS THE RECENT QUANTUM THEORIES OF MODERN PHYSICS. FREUDIAN AND NEO-FREUDIAN SCHOOLS BASED ON THE CARTESIAN MODEL HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED BY THE HUMANISTIC SCHOOLS WHICH COME MUCH CLOSER TO THE VEDANTIC APPROACH OF UNITARINESS. A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE TWO APPROACHES IS DISCUSSED.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
20 2391 18 YOGA AND BODY IMAGE: FINDINGS FROM A LARGE POPULATION-BASED STUDY OF YOUNG ADULTS. THIS STUDY EXPLORED THE POTENTIAL FOR YOGA TO PROMOTE BODY SATISFACTION IN A GENERAL POPULATION OF YOUNG ADULTS. THE SAMPLE INCLUDED 1664 PARTICIPANTS (M AGE: 31.1, SD=1.6YEARS) IN PROJECT EAT, A 15-YEAR LONGITUDINAL STUDY. DATA FROM THE THIRD AND FOURTH WAVES (EAT-III AND EAT-IV), COLLECTED FIVE YEARS APART, WERE UTILIZED. PRACTICING YOGA (>/=30MIN/WEEK) WAS REPORTED BY 16.2% OF YOUNG ADULTS. AFTER ADJUSTING FOR EAT-III BODY SATISFACTION AND BODY MASS INDEX, YOGA PRACTITIONERS HAD HIGHER CONCURRENT BODY SATISFACTION AT EAT-IV THAN THOSE NOT PRACTICING YOGA (DIFFERENCE: 1.5 UNITS [95% CI: 0.1-2.8], P=.03). AMONG PARTICIPANTS WITHIN THE LOWEST QUARTILE OF PRIOR (EAT-III) BODY SATISFACTION, THERE WAS PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE THAT BODY SATISFACTION AT EAT-IV WAS HIGHER AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS THAN IN OTHER YOUNG ADULTS. FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED BODY SATISFACTION, PARTICULARLY AMONG YOUNG ADULTS WITH LOW PRIOR BODY SATISFACTION.	2018

1 2245 155 THE INFLUENCE OF YOGA-BASED PROGRAMS ON RISK PROFILES IN ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE THAT YOGA MAY OFFER A SAFE AND COST-EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM 2). HOWEVER, SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS ARE LACKING. THIS ARTICLE CRITICALLY REVIEWS THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA-BASED PROGRAMS ON PHYSIOLOGIC AND ANTHROPOMETRIC RISK PROFILES AND RELATED CLINICAL OUTCOMES IN ADULTS WITH DM 2. WE PERFORMED A COMPREHENSIVE LITERATURE SEARCH USING FOUR COMPUTERIZED ENGLISH AND INDIAN SCIENTIFIC DATABASES. THE SEARCH WAS RESTRICTED TO ORIGINAL STUDIES (1970-2006) THAT EVALUATED THE METABOLIC AND CLINICAL EFFECTS OF YOGA IN ADULTS WITH DM 2. STUDIES TARGETING CLINICAL POPULATIONS WITH CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS THAT INCLUDED ADULTS WITH COMORBID DM WERE ALSO EVALUATED. DATA WERE EXTRACTED REGARDING STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, TARGET POPULATION, INTERVENTION, COMPARISON GROUP OR CONDITION, OUTCOME ASSESSMENT, DATA ANALYSIS AND PRESENTATION, FOLLOW-UP, AND KEY RESULTS, AND THE QUALITY OF EACH STUDY WAS EVALUATED ACCORDING TO SPECIFIC PREDETERMINED CRITERIA. WE IDENTIFIED 25 ELIGIBLE STUDIES, INCLUDING 15 UNCONTROLLED TRIALS, 6 NON-RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS AND 4 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS). OVERALL, THESE STUDIES SUGGEST BENEFICIAL CHANGES IN SEVERAL RISK INDICES, INCLUDING GLUCOSE TOLERANCE AND INSULIN SENSITIVITY, LIPID PROFILES, ANTHROPOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS, BLOOD PRESSURE, OXIDATIVE STRESS, COAGULATION PROFILES, SYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION AND PULMONARY FUNCTION, AS WELL AS IMPROVEMENT IN SPECIFIC CLINICAL OUTCOMES. YOGA MAY IMPROVE RISK PROFILES IN ADULTS WITH DM 2, AND MAY HAVE PROMISE FOR THE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF CARDIOVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS IN THIS POPULATION. HOWEVER, THE LIMITATIONS CHARACTERIZING MOST STUDIES PRECLUDE DRAWING FIRM CONCLUSIONS. ADDITIONAL HIGH-QUALITY RCTS ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM AND FURTHER ELUCIDATE THE EFFECTS OF STANDARDIZED YOGA PROGRAMS IN POPULATIONS WITH DM 2.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
2 1404  54 IMPACT OF YOGA ON COGNITION AND MENTAL HEALTH AMONG ELDERLY: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. BACKGROUND: COGNITIVE DECLINE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE THE MOST FREQUENTLY OBSERVED AND UNDER-TREATED ISSUES AMONG THE ELDERLY. MANY STUDIES HAVE ASSESSED THE EFFICACY OF YOGA ON COGNITIVE AND MENTAL HEALTH PARAMETERS AMONG THE ELDERLY. HOWEVER, UP TO DATE, THERE IS NO SYSTEMATIC REVIEW DONE TO EVALUATE THE ROLE OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ON COGNITION AND MENTAL HEALTH IN THE ELDERLY. OBJECTIVE: THIS REVIEW EVALUATES THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF YOGA IN IMPROVING COGNITIVE AND MENTAL HEALTH IN THE ELDERLY. METHODOLOGY: A COMPREHENSIVE SEARCH HAS PERFORMED ON MEDLINE, GOOGLE SCHOLAR, PUBMED, AND PSYCINFO ELECTRONIC DATABASE FROM THEIR INCEPTION TO JANUARY 2019. THE LITERATURE SEARCH WAS CONSTRUCTED AROUND SEARCH TERM FOR "MENTAL HEALTH", "COGNITION", "YOGA" AND "ELDERLY". OUT OF 3388 RECORDS, WE WERE CONSIDERED ONLY RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS (RCTS) WITH YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ON THE OLDER PEOPLE FOR THIS REVIEW. RISK OF BIAS WAS ASSESSED USING DELPHI LIST AND PEDRO CRITERIA. RESULTS: AFTER FILTERING OUT IRRELEVANT STUDIES, IN OUR SEARCH, WE COME ACROSS 13 RCTS, AND THEY INCLUDED IN THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OF 13 RCTS, FOUR STUDIES ASSESSED ONLY COGNITIVE PARAMETERS AND FIVE STUDIES ASSESSED ONLY PSYCHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS, AND FOUR STUDIES EVALUATED BOTH. STUDY QUALITY WAS FAIR TO MODERATE OF INCLUDED RCTS ON THE DELPHI LIST AND PEDRO CRITERIA. MAXIMUM STUDIED VARIABLES IN COGNITION WERE EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS, MEMORY, ATTENTION, AND LANGUAGE WHILE IN MENTAL HEALTH DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, STRESS, AND MOOD. YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS HAVE SOME BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON ATTENTION, EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS AMONG COGNITIVE VARIABLES, AND DEPRESSION AMONG MENTAL HEALTH PARAMETERS AMONG THE ELDERLY. CONCLUSION: THE PRESENT REVIEW INDICATES THAT YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS HAVE SOME POSITIVE EVIDENCE IN IMPROVING ATTENTION, EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS AND MEMORY OF COGNITION, WHILE DEPRESSION IN MENTAL HEALTH COMPARED TO ACTIVE CONTROL AMONG THE ELDERLY. HOWEVER, METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS AND SMALL NUMBER OF STUDIES PRECLUDE CONFIRMING THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ON COGNITION AND MENTAL HEALTH AMONG THE ELDERLY. FURTHER, THIS REVIEW STRONGLY RECOMMENDS MORE RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS WITH STANDARD STUDY METHODOLOGY, USE OF VALIDATED MODULES OF YOGA INTERVENTION, AND LONG TERM FOLLOW UP TO HAVE DEFINITE CONCLUSIONS.	2020	

3 1927  35 ROLE OF YOGA IN CARDIAC DISEASE AND REHABILITATION. PURPOSE: CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE CONTINUES TO BE THE LEADING CAUSE OF MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY AROUND THE WORLD. YOGA, A COMBINATION OF PHYSICAL POSTURES (ASANA), BREATHING EXERCISES (PRANAYAMA), AND MEDITATION (DHYANA), HAS GAINED INCREASING RECOGNITION AS A FORM OF MIND-BODY EXERCISE. IN THIS NARRATIVE REVIEW, WE INTENDED TO REVIEW THE EMERGING EVIDENCE ASSESSING THE PHYSIOLOGIC AND CLINICAL EFFECTS OF YOGA ON THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM AND THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF YOGA AS A COMPONENT OF COMPREHENSIVE CARDIAC REHABILITATION. METHODS: WE SEARCHED PUBMED, GOOGLE SCHOLAR, EMBASE, AND COCHRANE DATABASES FOR LITERATURE RELATED TO CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS OF YOGA FROM INCEPTION UP UNTIL 2017. RESULTS: YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE FAVORABLE EFFECTS ON SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION, STRESS, THE CARDIAC AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM, AND TRADITIONAL AND EMERGING CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA HAS SHOWN PROMISE AS A USEFUL LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION THAT CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE MANAGEMENT ALGORITHMS. ALTHOUGH MANY INVESTIGATORS HAVE REPORTED THE CLINICAL BENEFITS OF YOGA IN REDUCING CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS, MORBIDITY, AND MORTALITY, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THESE CONCLUSIONS IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED, THEREBY EMPHASIZING THE NEED FOR LARGE, WELL-DESIGNED RANDOMIZED TRIALS THAT MINIMIZE BIAS AND METHODOLOGICAL DRAWBACKS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
4 2454  36 YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR METABOLIC SYNDROME: A NARRATIVE REVIEW. METABOLIC SYNDROME (MS) IS ASSOCIATED WITH A SEDENTARY AND STRESSFUL LIFESTYLE AND AFFECTS UNDERACTIVE PEOPLE DISPROPORTIONATELY. YOGA IS CONSIDERED TO BE A LOW-IMPACT MIND-BODY STRESS-RELIEVING EXERCISE, AND RESEARCHERS ARE INCREASING THEIR FOCUS ON THE BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR MANAGING METABOLIC DISORDERS. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR PHYSICIANS AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS TO UNDERSTAND THE THERAPEUTIC EFFICACY OF YOGA INTERVENTION, IN TERMS OF ITS TYPE, DURATION AND FREQUENCY ON VARIOUS MS RISK FACTORS. THE PRESENT REVIEW SUMMARIZES THE CURRENT SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON MS RISK FACTORS SUCH AS GLUCOSE HOMEOSTASIS MARKERS, LIPID PROFILE, ADIPOCYTOKINES AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS, AND DISCUSSES THE POSSIBLE MECHANISMS OF ACTION. MEDLINE, PUBMED, SCOPUS AND COCHRANE LIBRARY WERE SEARCHED FROM THEIR INCEPTION UP TO DECEMBER 2019, USING THE KEYWORDS "METABOLIC SYNDROME," "DIABETES," "CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES," "OBESITY" AND "YOGA." THE LITERATURE SUMMARIZED IN THIS REVIEW HAVE SHOWN MIXED EFFECTS OF YOGA ON MS RISK FACTORS AND DO NOT PROVIDE ROBUST EVIDENCE FOR ITS EFFICACY. MORE RIGOROUS RESEARCH AND WELL-DESIGNED TRIALS THAT HAVE A HIGHER STANDARD OF METHODOLOGY AND EVALUATE YOGA'S LONG-TERM IMPACTS ON MS ARE NEEDED. UNDERSTANDING YOGA'S BIOCHEMICAL AND MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF ACTION ON VARIOUS METABOLIC PATHWAYS IS ALSO NEEDED.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
5 2548  39 YOGA FOR CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS. BACKGROUND: YOGA HAS BEEN PRACTICED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING. EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON YOGA HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR SEVERAL DECADES, INCLUDING SEVERAL RECENT STUDIES CONDUCTED WITH CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS. METHODS: THIS REVIEW PROVIDES A GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO YOGA AND A DETAILED REVIEW OF YOGA RESEARCH IN CANCER. RESULTS: NINE STUDIES CONDUCTED WITH CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS YIELDED MODEST IMPROVEMENTS IN SLEEP QUALITY, MOOD, STRESS, CANCER-RELATED DISTRESS, CANCER-RELATED SYMPTOMS, AND OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE. STUDIES CONDUCTED IN OTHER PATIENT POPULATIONS AND HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS HAVE SHOWN BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOMATIC SYMPTOMS, AS WELL AS OTHER ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL FUNCTION. CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS FROM THE EMERGING LITERATURE ON YOGA AND CANCER PROVIDE PRELIMINARY SUPPORT FOR THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFICACY OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR CANCER PATIENTS, ALTHOUGH CONTROLLED TRIALS ARE LACKING. FURTHER RESEARCH IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE RELIABILITY OF THESE EFFECTS AND TO IDENTIFY THEIR UNDERLYING MECHANISMS.	2005	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
6 1187  41 EVIDENCE BASED EFFECTS OF YOGA PRACTICE ON VARIOUS HEALTH RELATED PROBLEMS OF ELDERLY PEOPLE: A REVIEW. MORE THAN 50% OF THE ELDERLY ABOVE 60 YEARS OF AGE SUFFER FROM CHRONIC MEDICAL CONDITIONS, THE PREVALENCE OF WHICH INCREASES WITH AGE. THOUGH YOGA HAS BEEN REPORTED AS AN EFFECTIVE MODALITY IN IMPROVING VARIOUS PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF ELDERLY POPULATIONS, A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF YOGA AND ITS EFFECTS ON VARIOUS HEALTH RELATED PROBLEMS OF ELDERLY POPULATIONS HAS NOT YET BEEN REPORTED. HENCE, WE PERFORMED PUBMED/MEDLINE SEARCH TO REVIEW RELEVANT ARTICLES, USING KEYWORD "YOGA AND ELDERLY". RELEVANT ARTICLES PUBLISHED SINCE INCEPTION TILL 6TH OCTOBER 2016 WERE INCLUDED FOR THE REVIEW. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE, THIS REVIEW SUGGESTS THAT THE REGULAR PRACTICE OF YOGA CAN BE CONSIDERED AS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION IN IMPROVING PHYSICAL (REDUCES HEART RATE, BLOOD PRESSURE, BLOOD GLUCOSE, OXIDATIVE DAMAGE, FATIGUE, WEAKNESS, FEAR OF FALL, AND IMPROVE HEART RATE VARIABILITY, BAROREFLEX SENSITIVITY, INSULIN SENSITIVITY, PHYSICAL FUNCTIONS, MOBILITY, FLEXIBILITY, AND URINARY INCONTINENCE), MENTAL (REDUCES DEPRESSION, ANXIETY), EMOTIONAL (REDUCES ANGER, STRESS, TENSION AND IMPROVE SELF-EFFICACY), SOCIAL (IMPROVE LIFE SATISFACTION), AND VITAL (IMPROVED VITALITY) PLANES OF ELDERLY INDIVIDUALS, OFFERING A BETTER QUALITY OF SLEEP AND QUALITY OF LIFE.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
7  549  28 CONTEXTUALIZING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY ON DIABETES MANAGEMENT: A REVIEW OF THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A REVIEW OF LITERATURE BOTH TO IDENTIFY THE EFFECTS OF YOGA-BASED THERAPY ON THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS AND TO EXAMINE THE SOCIAL CONTEXT OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. FINDINGS FROM THE REVIEW INDICATE THAT YOGA HAS A POSITIVE SHORT-TERM EFFECT ON MULTIPLE DIABETES-RELATED OUTCOMES; HOWEVER, LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY ON DIABETES MANAGEMENT REMAIN UNCLEAR. THE CONTEXT OF THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS, COMMUNITY CHARACTERISTICS, AND DISCRIMINATION, INFLUENCES THE ADOPTION AND MAINTENANCE OF HEALTH BEHAVIORS SUCH AS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, INCLUDING YOGA PRACTICE. FURTHER RESEARCH IS NECESSARY TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THIS INFLUENCE.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
8 2411  43 YOGA AND IMMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTIONING: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. YOGA IS AN ANCIENT MIND-BODY PRACTICE THAT IS INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED TO HAVE HEALTH BENEFITS IN A VARIETY OF CLINICAL AND NON-CLINICAL CONDITIONS. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW SUMMARIZES THE FINDINGS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON IMMUNE SYSTEM FUNCTIONING WHICH IS IMPERATIVE TO JUSTIFY ITS APPLICATION IN THE CLINIC. FIFTEEN RCTS WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THE REVIEW. EVEN THOUGH THE EXISTING EVIDENCE IS NOT ENTIRELY CONSISTENT, A GENERAL PATTERN EMERGED SUGGESTING THAT YOGA CAN DOWNREGULATE PRO-INFLAMMATORY MARKERS. IN PARTICULAR, THE QUALITATIVE EVALUATION OF RCTS REVEALED DECREASES IN IL-1BETA, AS WELL AS INDICATIONS FOR REDUCTIONS IN IL-6 AND TNF-ALPHA. THESE RESULTS IMPLY THAT YOGA MAY BE IMPLEMENTED AS A COMPLEMENTARY INTERVENTION FOR POPULATIONS AT RISK OR ALREADY SUFFERING FROM DISEASES WITH AN INFLAMMATORY COMPONENT. BEYOND THIS, YOGA PRACTICE MAY EXERT FURTHER BENEFICIAL EFFECTS BY ENHANCING CELL-MEDIATED AND MUCOSAL IMMUNITY. IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT LONGER TIME SPANS OF YOGA PRACTICE ARE REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE CONSISTENT EFFECTS ESPECIALLY ON CIRCULATING INFLAMMATORY MARKERS. OVERALL, THIS FIELD OF INVESTIGATION IS STILL YOUNG, HENCE THE CURRENT BODY OF EVIDENCE IS SMALL AND FOR MOST IMMUNE PARAMETERS, MORE RESEARCH IS REQUIRED TO DRAW DISTINCT CONCLUSIONS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
9 2422  52 YOGA AND MINDFULNESS AS THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS FOR STROKE REHABILITATION: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. AIM. THIS PAPER REPORTS A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF THE EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BEHAVIORAL THERAPIES SUCH AS YOGA AND MINDFULNESS PRACTICES FOR STROKE REHABILITATION. BACKGROUND. THE EXPERIENCE OF STROKE CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON BOTH PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH AND ON QUALITY OF LIFE. YOGA AND RELEVANT PRACTICES ARE PROMISING THERAPIES THAT HAVE BEEN USED WITH PATIENTS WITH A VARIETY OF CONDITIONS. IN ORDER TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS ON EFFECTIVENESS FOR STROKE PATIENTS, THE EVIDENCE REQUIRES SYSTEMATIC ASSESSMENT. METHODS. A COMPREHENSIVE SEARCH OF MAJOR BIOMEDICAL AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE DATABASES WAS CONDUCTED. RELEVANT RESEARCH WAS CATEGORIZED BY STUDY TYPE AND APPRAISED ACCORDING TO STUDY DESIGN. RESULTS. FIVE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS AND FOUR SINGLE CASE STUDIES WERE FOUND. ADDITIONALLY, ONE QUALITATIVE RESEARCH STUDY WAS IDENTIFIED. STUDIES REPORTED POSITIVE RESULTS, INCLUDING IMPROVEMENTS IN COGNITION, MOOD, AND BALANCE AND REDUCTIONS IN STRESS. MODIFICATIONS TO DIFFERENT YOGA PRACTICES MAKE COMPARISON BETWEEN STUDIES DIFFICULT, AND A LACK OF CONTROLLED STUDIES PRECLUDES ANY FIRM CONCLUSIONS ON EFFICACY. CONCLUSION. YOGA AND MINDFULNESS COULD BE CLINICALLY VALUABLE SELF-ADMINISTERED INTERVENTION OPTIONS FOR STROKE REHABILITATION. FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO EVALUATE THESE SPECIFIC PRACTICES AND THEIR SUITABILITY IN STROKE REHABILITATION.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
10 2689  49 YOGA IN THE WORKPLACE AND HEALTH OUTCOMES: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. BACKGROUND: HEALTH PROMOTION IN THE WORKPLACE IS INTENDED TO ENHANCE EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. YOGA PROGRAMMES ARE EASY TO IMPLEMENT AND HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF VARIOUS HEALTH CONDITIONS. AIMS: TO ASSESS THE EVIDENCE REGARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA PROGRAMMES AT WORK. METHODS: A SEARCH OF ELECTRONIC DATABASES OF PUBLISHED STUDIES UP UNTIL THE 1ST OF APRIL 2017. INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WERE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS OF ADULT EMPLOYEES AND YOGA IN THE WORKPLACE. QUALITY APPRAISAL WAS CARRIED OUT USING THE COCHRANE COLLABORATION'S TOOL FOR ASSESSING RISK OF BIAS IN RANDOMIZED TRIALS. RESULTS: OF 1343 PAPERS IDENTIFIED, 13 STUDIES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. NINE OUT OF 13 TRIALS WERE CLASSIFIED AS HAVING AN UNCLEAR RISK OF BIAS. THE OVERALL EFFECTS OF YOGA ON MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES WERE BENEFICIAL, MAINLY ON STRESS. MOST OF THE CARDIOVASCULAR ENDPOINTS SHOWED NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN YOGA AND CONTROLS. OTHER OUTCOMES REPORTED POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA OR NO CHANGE. CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT YOGA HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON HEALTH IN THE WORKPLACE, PARTICULARLY IN REDUCING STRESS, AND NO NEGATIVE EFFECTS WERE REPORTED IN ANY OF THE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. FURTHER LARGER STUDIES ARE REQUIRED TO CONFIRM THIS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
11 1515  32 IS YOGA A SUITABLE TREATMENT FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS: CURRENT OPINION. WE REVIEWED PUBLISHED LITERATURE REGARDING THE USE OF YOGA FOR MANAGING RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS TO DETERMINE WHETHER ADEQUATE EVIDENCE EXISTS TO SUGGEST ITS USEFULNESS AS A THERAPY. A SEARCH FOR PREVIOUS STUDIES INVOLVING YOGA AND RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS IN PUBMED YIELDED EIGHT REPORTS. THESE STUDIES REPORTED THE BENEFITS OF YOGA IN THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OF PATIENTS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA), SUGGESTING THAT YOGA IS A USEFUL ADD-ON THERAPY FOR RA PATIENTS. HOWEVER, ALL STUDIES SHOWED LIMITATIONS WITH RESPECT TO SAMPLE SIZE, STUDY DESIGN, DESCRIPTION AND DURATION OF YOGA INTERVENTION, AND ASSESSMENT TOOLS AND STATISTICAL METHODS USED. ADDITIONALLY, THE STUDIES DID NOT ATTEMPT TO UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING OBSERVED BENEFITS. HENCE, EVIDENCE SUGGESTS A DEFINITE ROLE OF YOGA IN RA IMPROVEMENT, REDUCING PAIN, IMPROVING FUNCTION, AND CREATING A POSITIVE MENTAL STATE. HOWEVER, DETAILED ANALYSIS AND ADDITIONAL STUDIES ARE NECESSARY TO VERIFY THESE OBSERVATIONS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
12  644  29 DOES YOGA HAVE A ROLE IN SCHIZOPHRENIA MANAGEMENT? PURPOSE OF REVIEW: TO REVIEW THE EFFICACY OF ADD-ON YOGA THERAPY IN IMPROVING SYMPTOMS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA AND QUALITY OF LIFE AND EXAMINE THE POSSIBLE UNDERLYING BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS OF YOGA IN SCHIZOPHRENIA. RECENT FINDINGS: QUALITY OF LIFE, COGNITIVE SYMPTOMS, AND NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO IMPROVE WITH ADD-ON YOGA THERAPY IN SCHIZOPHRENIA (POOLED MEAN EFFECT SIZE 0.8, 0.6, AND 0.4, RESPECTIVELY). YOGA ALSO SEEMS TO HAVE A SMALL EFFECT ON IMPROVING POSITIVE SYMPTOMS. LESS EXPLORED AREAS INCLUDE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF YOGA ITSELF AS WELL AS ITS EFFECTS ON ANTIPSYCHOTIC-INDUCED COMPLICATIONS. PRELIMINARY FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE EFFECTS OF YOGA MAY BE MEDIATED BY NEUROHORMONAL MECHANISMS AND FUNCTIONAL CHANGES IN BRAIN ACTIVITY. ADD-ON YOGA THERAPY IS A POTENTIAL TREATMENT OPTION FOR IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE, COGNITIVE SYMPTOMS, AND NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS IN SCHIZOPHRENIA. FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD EXPLORE EFFICACY IN MULTICENTRIC TRIALS AS WELL AS POSSIBLE NEUROBIOLOGICAL CHANGES UNDERLYING THE EFFECTS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
13 2023  44 SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF YOGA FOR SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT DURING CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. INTRODUCTION: BREAST CANCER IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY DIAGNOSED CANCERS IN WOMEN IN THE US, AND ITS TREATMENTS HAVE SIGNIFICANT PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SIDE EFFECTS AND LONG-TERM COMPLICATIONS CAUSING SIGNIFICANT MORBIDITY AND DECREASED QUALITY OF LIFE. INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE MODALITIES, SUCH AS YOGA, HAVE BEEN FOUND TO REDUCE SIDE EFFECTS OF CONVENTIONAL TREATMENTS WITHOUT INTERFERING WITH THE TREATMENT ITSELF AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE. IN THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW, WE SPECIFICALLY EXPLORED YOGA AS A POTENTIAL OPTION FOR SYMPTOMATIC MANAGEMENT IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING CONVENTIONAL BREAST CANCER TREATMENTS. METHODS: WE PERFORMED A LITERATURE SEARCH THAT WAS CONDUCTED TO INCLUDE THE DATABASES PUBMED, PSYCHINFO, COCHRANE LIBRARY, SCOPUS, AND CINAHL, RESULTING IN 28 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) ARTICLES. WE REVIEW THE RESULTS OF THESE TRIALS REGARDING THE IMPACT OF YOGA IN THIS PATIENT POPULATION. RESULTS: OVERALL, THE MAJORITY OF THE RCT ARTICLES SHOWED SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS OF YOGA INTERVENTION IN VARIOUS ASPECTS OF QUALITY OF LIFE, FATIGUE, NAUSEA/VOMITING, SLEEP QUALITY, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND DISTRESS. THERE ARE SEVERAL STUDIES THAT HAVE EXPLORED THE PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISM BEHIND THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND FOUND THAT YOGA AFFECTS BOTH THE IMMUNE RESPONSE AND INFLAMMATION. DISCUSSION: THESE STUDIES REVEALED THAT YOGA HAS A POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC ROLE IN THE SYMPTOMATIC MANAGEMENT OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS, ENHANCING QUALITY OF LIFE DURING TREATMENT AS WELL AS IMPROVING ADHERENCE TO TREATMENT. FUTURE STUDIES WITH MORE DEFINED AND CONSISTENT METHODOLOGIES ARE NECESSARY TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL USE OF YOGA THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
14 2416  39 YOGA AND MEDITATION IN CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. YOGA IS A HOLISTIC MIND-BODY INTERVENTION AIMED AT PHYSICAL, MENTAL, EMOTIONAL AND SPIRITUAL WELL BEING. SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT YOGA AND/OR MEDITATION CAN CONTROL RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE LIKE HYPERTENSION, TYPE II DIABETES AND INSULIN RESISTANCE, OBESITY, LIPID PROFILE, PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS AND SMOKING. SOME RANDOMIZED STUDIES SUGGEST THAT YOGA/MEDITATION COULD RETARD OR EVEN REGRESS EARLY AND ADVANCED CORONARY ATHEROSCLEROSIS. A RECENT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT TRANSCENDENTAL MEDITATION MAY BE EXTREMELY USEFUL IN SECONDARY PREVENTION OF CORONARY HEART DISEASE AND MAY REDUCE CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS BY 48% OVER A 5-YEAR PERIOD. ANOTHER SMALL STUDY SUGGESTS THAT YOGA MAY BE HELPFUL IN PREVENTION OF ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. HOWEVER, MOST STUDIES HAVE SEVERAL LIMITATIONS LIKE LACK OF ADEQUATE CONTROLS, SMALL SAMPLE SIZE, INCONSISTENCIES IN BASELINE AND DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES, ETC. AND THEREFORE LARGE TRIALS WITH IMPROVED METHODOLOGIES ARE REQUIRED TO CONFIRM THESE FINDINGS. HOWEVER, IN VIEW OF THE EXISTING KNOWLEDGE AND YOGA BEING A COST-EFFECTIVE TECHNIQUE WITHOUT SIDE EFFECTS, IT APPEARS APPROPRIATE TO INCORPORATE YOGA/MEDITATION FOR PRIMARY AND SECONDARY PREVENTION OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
15 1424  34 IMPROVEMENT IN PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS AFTER 6 MONTHS OF YOGA PRACTICE. YOGA IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON COGNITION, ATTENUATION OF EMOTIONAL INTENSITY AND STRESS REDUCTION. PREVIOUS STUDIES WERE MAINLY PERFORMED ON EASTERN EXPERIENCED PRACTITIONERS OR UNHEALTHY SUBJECTS UNDERGOING CONCOMITANT CONVENTIONAL THERAPIES. FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS NEEDED ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA PER SE, AS WELL AS ITS POSSIBLE PREVENTIVE BENEFITS ON HEALTHY SUBJECTS. WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON MEMORY AND PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS RELATED TO STRESS, COMPARING YOGA PRACTICE AND CONVENTIONAL PHYSICAL EXERCISES IN HEALTHY MEN (PREVIOUSLY YOGA-NAIVE). MEMORY TESTS, SALIVARY CORTISOL LEVELS AND STRESS, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION INVENTORIES WERE ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER 6 MONTHS OF PRACTICE. YOGA PRACTITIONERS SHOWED IMPROVEMENT OF THE MEMORY PERFORMANCE, AS WELL AS IMPROVEMENTS IN PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS. THE PRESENT RESULTS SUGGEST THAT REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE CAN IMPROVE ASPECTS OF COGNITION AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS. AN INDIRECT INFLUENCE OF EMOTIONAL STATE ON COGNITIVE IMPROVEMENT PROMOTED BY YOGA PRACTICE CAN BE PROPOSED.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
16  226  42 A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMISED CONTROL TRIALS ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS MEASURES AND MOOD. STRESS RELATED DISORDERS SUCH AS DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY ARE LEADING SOURCES OF DISABILITY WORLDWIDE, AND CURRENT TREATMENT METHODS SUCH AS CONVENTIONAL ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATIONS ARE NOT BENEFICIAL FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT YOGA HAS MOOD-ENHANCING PROPERTIES POSSIBLY RELATED TO ITS INHIBITORY EFFECTS ON PHYSIOLOGICAL STRESS AND INFLAMMATION, WHICH ARE FREQUENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH AFFECTIVE DISORDERS. HOWEVER THE BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS VIA WHICH YOGA EXERTS ITS THERAPEUTIC MOOD-MODULATING EFFECTS ARE LARGELY UNKNOWN. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW INVESTIGATES THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND HYPOTHALAMIC PITUITARY ADRENAL AXIS REGULATION MEASURES. IT FOCUSES ON STUDIES COLLECTING PHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS SUCH AS BLOOD PRESSURE, HEART RATE, CORTISOL, PERIPHERAL CYTOKINE EXPRESSION AND/OR STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL BRAIN MEASURES IN REGIONS INVOLVED IN STRESS AND MOOD REGULATION. OVERALL THE 25 RANDOMISED CONTROL STUDIES DISCUSSED PROVIDE PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT YOGA PRACTICE LEADS TO BETTER REGULATION OF THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-ADRENAL SYSTEM, AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN DEPRESSIVE AND ANXIOUS SYMPTOMS IN A RANGE OF POPULATIONS. FURTHER RESEARCH IS WARRANTED TO CONFIRM THESE PRELIMINARY FINDINGS AND FACILITATE IMPLEMENTATION IN CLINICAL SETTINGS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
17 1910 117 RISK INDICES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INSULIN RESISTANCE SYNDROME, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, AND POSSIBLE PROTECTION WITH YOGA: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVE: TO CONDUCT A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF PUBLISHED LITERATURE REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA, A PROMISING MIND-BODY THERAPY, ON SPECIFIC ANTHROPOMETRIC AND PHYSIOLOGIC INDICES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (CVD) RISK AND ON RELATED CLINICAL ENDPOINTS. METHODS: WE PERFORMED A LITERATURE SEARCH USING 4 COMPUTERIZED ENGLISH AND INDIAN SCIENTIFIC DATABASES. THE SEARCH WAS RESTRICTED TO ORIGINAL STUDIES (1970 TO 2004) EVALUATING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CVD OR INDICES OF CVD RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE INSULIN RESISTANCE SYNDROME (IRS). RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS), NONRANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS, UNCONTROLLED (PRE AND POST) CLINICAL TRIALS, AND CROSS-SECTIONAL (OBSERVATIONAL) STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IF THEY MET SPECIFIC CRITERIA. DATA WERE EXTRACTED REGARDING STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, POPULATION SIZE AND CHARACTERISTICS, INTERVENTION TYPE AND DURATION, COMPARISON GROUP OR CONDITION, OUTCOME ASSESSMENT, DATA ANALYSIS AND PRESENTATION, FOLLOW-UP, AND KEY RESULTS, AND THE QUALITY OF EACH STUDY WAS EVALUATED ACCORDING TO SPECIFIC PREDETERMINED CRITERIA. RESULTS: WE IDENTIFIED 70 ELIGIBLE STUDIES, INCLUDING 1 OBSERVATIONAL STUDY, 26 UNCONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS, 21 NONRANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS, AND 22 RCTS. TOGETHER, THE REPORTED RESULTS OF THESE STUDIES INDICATE BENEFICIAL CHANGES OVERALL IN SEVERAL IRS-RELATED INDICES OF CVD RISK, INCLUDING GLUCOSE TOLERANCE AND INSULIN SENSITIVITY, LIPID PROFILES, ANTHROPOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS, BLOOD PRESSURE, OXIDATIVE STRESS, COAGULATION PROFILES, SYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION, AND CARDIOVAGAL FUNCTION, AS WELL AS IMPROVEMENT IN SEVERAL CLINICAL ENDPOINTS. CONCLUSIONS: COLLECTIVELY, THESE STUDIES SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY REDUCE MANY IRS-RELATED RISK FACTORS FOR CVD, MAY IMPROVE CLINICAL OUTCOMES, AND MAY AID IN THE MANAGEMENT OF CVD AND OTHER IRS-RELATED CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, THE METHODOLOGIC AND OTHER LIMITATIONS CHARACTERIZING MOST OF THESE STUDIES PRECLUDE DRAWING FIRM CONCLUSIONS. ADDITIONAL HIGH QUALITY RCTS ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM AND FURTHER ELUCIDATE THE EFFECTS OF STANDARDIZED YOGA PROGRAMS ON SPECIFIC INDICES OF CVD RISK AND RELATED CLINICAL ENDPOINTS.	2005	
                                                                                                                                                                      
18 2141  39 THE EFFECTS OF GROUP-BASED LAUGHTER YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON MENTAL HEALTH IN ADULTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. WHAT IS KNOWN ON THE SUBJECT?: LAUGHTER YOGA IS CLAIMED TO PROMOTE MENTAL HEALTH AND HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY POPULAR WORLDWIDE. THERE HAS BEEN NO SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF LAUGHTER YOGA INTERVENTION STUDIES AND THUS EVIDENCE OF ITS EFFECTS ON MENTAL HEALTH IS UNCLEAR. WHAT THE PAPER ADDS TO EXISTING KNOWLEDGE?: LAUGHTER YOGA INTERVENTIONS IMPROVED DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IN TWO STUDIES OVER THE SHORT TERM. THERE IS A LACK OF GOOD QUALITY EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT LAUGHTER YOGA IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN OTHER GROUP-BASED INTERVENTIONS IN IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE?: WELL-CONDUCTED AND CLEARLY REPORTED TRIALS OF LAUGHTER YOGA ARE NEEDED BEFORE THE INTERVENTION CAN BE CONSIDERED AS AN EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH. ABSTRACT: INTRODUCTION LAUGHTER YOGA IS CLAIMED TO PROMOTE MENTAL HEALTH AND IS INCREASINGLY POPULAR WORLDWIDE. DESPITE ITS POPULARITY, THERE HAS BEEN NO SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF LAUGHTER YOGA INTERVENTION STUDIES AND THUS EVIDENCE OF ITS EFFECTS ON MENTAL HEALTH IS UNCLEAR. AIM THIS REVIEW AIMED TO CRITICALLY EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF GROUP-BASED LAUGHTER YOGA ON IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH IN ADULTS. METHOD WE CONDUCTED A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES (PUBLISHED FROM 1995 TO 2017). STUDY QUALITY WAS ASSESSED, THE EFFECT SIZES FOR INDIVIDUAL MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES WERE CALCULATED AND ALL REVIEWED STUDIES WERE NARRATIVELY SYNTHESIZED. RESULTS SIX EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES WITH INCONSISTENT RESULTS WERE INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW. THE MOST PROMISING EFFECT OF LAUGHTER YOGA IS THE IMPROVEMENT OF DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, INDICATING SIGNIFICANT MEDIUM-LARGE EFFECT SIZES IN TWO STUDIES OVER THE SHORT TERM.

20 2025  47 SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS TO PROMOTE CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH IN OLDER ADULTS. THE BENEFITS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ARE WELL ESTABLISHED, YET FEW OLDER ADULTS ENGAGE IN ADEQUATE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO OPTIMIZE HEALTH. WHILE YOGA MAY REDUCE THE RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, FEW STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE EFFICACY OF YOGA-BASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO PROMOTE CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH IN OLDER ADULTS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS REVIEW IS TO PROVIDE AN EVALUATION OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE CARDIOVASCULAR RISK IN OLDER ADULTS. FOUR DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN OLDER ADULTS. STUDIES WITH CARDIOVASCULAR OUTCOMES WERE INCLUDED. LITERATURE SEARCHES IDENTIFIED NINE ARTICLES ELIGIBLE FOR REVIEW. SIGNIFICANT HEALTH BENEFITS WERE REPORTED, INCLUDING FAVORABLE CHANGES IN BLOOD PRESSURE, BODY COMPOSITION, GLUCOSE, AND LIPIDS. YOGA PRACTICES, PARTICIPANT CHARACTERISTICS, AND OUTCOME MEASURES WERE VARIABLE. THERE WAS LIMITED USE OF THEORY. YOGA IS SAFE AND FEASIBLE IN OLDER ADULTS; ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS WARRANTED TO EXAMINE THE SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ESSENTIAL TO REDUCING CARDIOVASCULAR RISK.	2016

1  383 144 BENDING WITHOUT BREAKING: A NARRATIVE REVIEW OF TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA FOR WOMEN WITH PTSD. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW IS TO EVALUATE THE PEER-REVIEWED EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON THE USE OF TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA (TSY) FOR THE TREATMENT OF WOMEN WITH POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD): SPECIFICALLY INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA SUCH AS INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE. TO DATE, NO SUCH REVIEW HAS BEEN CONDUCTED. METHODS: ARTICLES MEETING STUDY INCLUSIONARY CRITERIA WERE IDENTIFIED THROUGH ELECTRONIC DATABASE SEARCHES. A TOTAL OF FIVE STUDIES (N = 5) WERE SELECTED AND REVIEWED. THESE STUDIES INCLUDED TWO RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCT), ONE FOLLOW-UP OF AN RCT, ONE QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY, AND ONE QUALITATIVE STUDY. RESULTS: THERE IS TENTATIVE EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE EFFICACY OF TSY IN REDUCING PTSD, DEPRESSION, AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMATOLOGY FOR WOMEN WITH PTSD; THERE IS ALSO TENTATIVE EVIDENCE CONFIRMING THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING TSY AS AN ADJUNCTIVE MENTAL HEALTH INTERVENTION, PARTICULARLY FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NON-RESPONSIVE TO COGNITIVE-BASED PSYCHOTHERAPIES. THE QUALITATIVE FINDINGS SPEAK TO A NUMBER OF BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE STIMULATED BY TSY PARTICIPATION CENTERING ON THE PHENOMENON OF PEACEFUL EMBODIMENT. CONCLUSIONS: REPLICATION OF THESE RESULTS USING LARGER AND MORE DIVERSE SAMPLES AND RIGOROUS STUDY DESIGNS BY INDEPENDENT RESEARCHERS WOULD ADD CREDIBILITY TO THESE FINDINGS AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE GROWING BODY OF KNOWLEDGE ON TSY. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS A DEARTH OF STUDIES ON THIS NASCENT FORM OF THERAPEUTIC YOGA. THEREFORE, FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL EFFICACY OF TSY WITH OTHER TYPES OF TRAUMA, POPULATIONS, AND SETTINGS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
2 2551  26 YOGA FOR CAREGIVING DYADS EXPERIENCING CHRONIC PAIN: PROTOCOL DEVELOPMENT FOR MERGING YOGA AND SELF-MANAGEMENT TO DEVELOP SKILLS INTERVENTION. CONTEXT: CAREGIVERS OFTEN PROVIDE UNPAID CARE FOR FAMILY MEMBERS AND FRIENDS WITH PHYSICAL DISABILITIES, OFTEN TO THE DETRIMENT OF THEIR HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. CAREGIVERS OFTEN EXPERIENCE PAIN, AND INDIVIDUALS WITH PHYSICAL DISABILITIES ALSO ARE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE PAIN. MERGING YOGA AND SELF-MANAGEMENT TO DEVELOP SKILLS STUDY (MY-SKILLS) IS AN INTERVENTION THAT MERGES SELF-MANAGEMENT EDUCATION WITH YOGA FOR DYADS EXPERIENCING CHRONIC PAIN. AIM: THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS THE YOGA PROTOCOL FOR THE MY-SKILLS INTERVENTION. METHODS: THE YOGA PROTOCOL WAS REVISED BASED ON FEEDBACK FROM SIX CAREGIVING DYADS. THE PROTOCOL FOCUSES ON REDUCING PAIN INTERFERENCE AND SUPPORTING THE CAREGIVING DYAD. RESULTS: THE FINAL YOGA PROTOCOL INCORPORATED THE FOLLOWING ELEMENTS: CENTERING AND MANTRA, PRANA VIDYA AND PRANAYAMA, ASANAS, MUDRA, AND GUIDED SAVASANA/DHYANA. CONCLUSION: THE MY-SKILLS YOGA PROTOCOL WAS MODIFIED BY A YOGA THERAPIST WITH FEEDBACK FROM STUDY PARTICIPANTS. REVISIONS FOCUSED ON THE CAREGIVING DYAD, WITH SPECIFIC ATTENTION TO REDUCING PAIN INTERFERENCE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
3 2312  35 TRAUMA SENSITIVE YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER: A QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS. RESEARCH ON POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AND CHRONIC CHILDHOOD ABUSE HAS REVEALED THAT TRADITIONAL TRAUMA TREATMENTS OFTEN FAIL TO FULLY ADDRESS THE COMPLICATED SYMPTOM PRESENTATION, INCLUDING THE SOMATIC COMPLAINTS, LOSS OF AWARENESS OF ONE'S EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL BEING IN THE PRESENT MOMENT, AND OVERALL LACK OF INTEGRATION BETWEEN THE SELF AND THE BODY. THE MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTION OF HATHA YOGA SHOWS PROMISE AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT, AND FOCUSES ON PERSONAL GROWTH IN ADDITION TO SYMPTOM REDUCTION. THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY EXPLORED THE EXPERIENCES OF THIRTY-ONE ADULT WOMEN WITH PTSD RELATED TO CHRONIC CHILDHOOD TRAUMA WHO PARTICIPATED IN A 10-WEEK TRAUMA SENSITIVE YOGA CLASS, SPECIFICALLY EXAMINING PERCEIVED CHANGES IN SYMPTOMS AND PERSONAL GROWTH. FIVE THEMES WERE IDENTIFIED THAT REFLECT PARTICIPANTS' FEELINGS OF GRATITUDE AND COMPASSION, RELATEDNESS, ACCEPTANCE, CENTEREDNESS, AND EMPOWERMENT. RESULTS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH AND CLINICAL WORK ARE PRESENTED.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
4  474  32 CLAIMING PEACEFUL EMBODIMENT THROUGH YOGA IN THE AFTERMATH OF TRAUMA. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DESCRIBE THE EXPERIENCES OF PRACTICING YOGA AND ITS ROLE WITHIN PROCESSES OF HEALING FOR ADULT WOMEN WITH COMPLEX TRAUMA HISTORIES. USING A HERMENEUTIC PHENOMENOLOGICAL METHOD, DATA WERE ANALYZED FROM INTERVIEWS WITH 39 WOMEN. RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE CORE MEANING OF PARTICIPANTS' EXPERIENCE OF HEALING THROUGH YOGA IS CLAIMING PEACEFUL EMBODIMENT. THIS IS AN ONGOING PROCESS OCCURRING ON A CONTINUUM WHEREBY WOMEN EXPERIENCED IMPROVED CONNECTIONS WITH AND SENSE OF OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL OVER THEIR BODIES, EMOTIONS AND THOUGHTS, AND A GREATER SENSE OF WELL-BEING, CALMNESS, AND WHOLENESS IN THEIR BODIES AND MINDS. A NUMBER OF INTERCONNECTED ESSENTIAL THEMES RELATED TO THIS CORE MEANING WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED, ILLUMINATING PROCESSES THAT SUPPORTED CLAIMING PEACEFUL EMBODIMENT AND CAPABILITIES THAT WERE ENABLED BY BEING MORE PEACEFULLY EMBODIED. ADDITIONAL THEMES WERE IDENTIFIED HIGHLIGHTING FACTORS THAT FACILITATED OR IMPEDED PARTICIPANTS' ENGAGEMENT WITH YOGA AND THEIR EXPERIENCES OF HEALING THROUGH YOGA.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
5  561  29 CREATING SPACE THROUGH AFRICA YOGA PROJECT: A QUALITATIVE STUDY. THIS QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS EXAMINED TEACHERS' EXPERIENCES OF THE AFRICA YOGA PROJECT (AYP), A MENTORING-ORIENTED YOGA PROGRAM FOR FOSTERING RESILIENCE AMONG INDIVIDUALS AND GROUPS IMPACTED BY POVERTY AND TRAUMA. INTERVIEWS CONDUCTED WITH AYP TEACHERS WERE CODED USING QUALITATIVE CONTENT ANALYSIS. THEMES DEMONSTRATED THAT AYP BENEFITED PARTICIPANTS BY CREATING S.P.A.C.E. (SAFETY AND STABILITY, PERSONAL GROWTH, ACTION, CULTURAL DIVERSITY, AND EMPOWERMENT). THE FINDINGS ILLUSTRATED WAYS IN WHICH THIS PROGRAM FOSTERED INDIVIDUAL AND COMMUNITY WELLNESS AND POSITIVE ENGAGEMENT. IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED INCLUDING THE POTENTIAL FOR PROVIDING YOGA AS A LOW-COST, SUSTAINABLE, AND EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION TO PROMOTE HEALTH, ECONOMIC SELF-SUFFICIENCY, AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT IN DIVERSE SETTINGS WITH LIMITED RESOURCES.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
6 2317  41 TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA INTERVENTIONS AND POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS AND DEPRESSION OUTCOMES AMONG WOMEN: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT MOST PEOPLE EXPERIENCE AT LEAST ONE TRAUMATIC EVENT IN THEIR LIFETIMES, AND BETWEEN 6% AND 8% OF THOSE WITH A HISTORY OF TRAUMA WILL DEVELOP POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) AND/OR RELATED MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. WOMEN FACE A GREATER THREAT OF TRAUMA EXPOSURE AND HAVE A HIGHER RISK OF PTSD AND DEPRESSION THAN MEN. TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA (TSY), A BODY-BASED ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY, HAS SHOWN POTENTIAL IN SEVERAL STUDIES AS AN EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR REDUCING PTSD AND DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS. HOWEVER, EXISTING RESEARCH AND SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS VARY WIDELY IN THEIR METHODOLOGICAL RIGOR AND COMPARISON SAMPLES. THUS, IN THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TSY AMONG WOMEN WITH A HISTORY OF TRAUMA AND DEPRESSION WHO HAD PARTICIPATED IN RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS WITH CLEAR CONTROL AND EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS. FINDINGS IN FIXED- AND MIXED-EFFECTS META-ANALYSIS MODELS SUGGEST MARGINALLY SIGNIFICANT TO NO EFFECTS OF TSY ON PTSD AND DEPRESSION OUTCOMES. OUR SYSTEMATIC REVIEW HIGHLIGHTS CRITICAL QUESTIONS AND SIGNIFICANT GAPS IN THE EXISTING LITERATURE ABOUT THE RATIONALE AND BEST PRACTICES OF TSY INTERVENTION DURATION.	2021

8 1214  22 EXPLORING THE BENEFIT OF YOGA PROGRAMS IN CARCERAL SETTINGS. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A PERSPECTIVE ON THE VALUE OF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS PROGRAMMING IN CARCERAL SETTINGS. THE AUTHORS EXPLORE THIS TOPIC THROUGH INTERVIEWS WITH TWO FORMERLY INCARCERATED PEOPLE WHO PARTICIPATED IN YOGA PROGRAMMING WHILE INCARCERATED AND WHO WENT ON TO BECOME YOGA INSTRUCTORS THEMSELVES. ALSO EXAMINED ARE THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA PROGRAMMING FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED, FOR THOSE WORKING WITHIN CARCERAL SETTINGS, AND ON CARCERAL ENVIRONMENTS GENERALLY. WE SHARE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTING YOGA PROGRAMMING IN CARCERAL INSTITUTIONS AND DISCUSS POLICY IMPLICATIONS. THE STORIES OF BOTH INTERVIEWEES REFLECT THE VALUE AND POTENTIAL POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA PROGRAMMING WITHIN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SETTINGS AND SUGGEST THE NEED FOR SUSTAINED PROGRAMMING AND ONGOING EMPIRICAL EVALUATION.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
9 1342  32 HOW YOGA HELPS HEAL INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA: PERSPECTIVES AND THEMES FROM 11 INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA SURVIVORS. TRAUMA IS UBIQUITOUS IN OUR SOCIETY; THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO EXPLORE HOW INDIVIDUALS CULTIVATE HEALING AFTER TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES. YOGA MAY BE ONE AVENUE TO CULTIVATE HEALING. QUALITATIVE METHODS WERE EMPLOYED TO STUDY THE ROLE YOGA PRACTICE PLAYED IN THE HEALING PROCESS OF THOSE WHO EXPERIENCED INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA. ELEVEN INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA SURVIVORS WHO PRACTICED YOGA REGULARLY WERE IDENTIFIED THROUGH A CRITERION SAMPLING METHOD. DATA ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT THE EMPHASIS OF YOGA ON MIND AND PHYSICAL BODY FOSTERED NUMEROUS POSITIVE OUTCOMES, SUCH AS SPIRITUAL GROWTH, SELF-ACCEPTANCE, ALLEVIATION OF TRAUMA-RELATED SYMPTOMS, AND INCREASED FEELINGS OF SELF-COMPASSION, EMPOWERMENT, AND SERENITY. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY BE HELPFUL TO REGAIN MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH, FOSTER WELLBEING, AND CULTIVATE PERSONAL GROWTH AFTER INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
10 1704  19 PARTNER YOGA FOR ESTABLISHING BOUNDARIES IN RELATIONSHIP: A TRANSPERSONAL SOMATIC APPROACH. THIS ARTICLE IS WRITTEN FOR YOGA THERAPISTS AND PSYCHOTHERAPISTS WHO WORK WITH COUPLES WHO HAVE DIFFICULTY SETTING BOUNDARIES AND MAINTAINING INDIVIDUALITY IN THEIR RELATIONSHIPS. PARTNER YOGA, TRANSPERSONAL PSYCHOLOGY, AND SOMATIC-BASED PSYCHOLOGY ARE APPROACHES THAT CAN PROVIDE CLIENTS WITH A HOLISTIC SYSTEM OF THERAPY TO ENCOURAGE HEALTHY BOUNDARIES AND EMOTIONAL CONNECTION. THE PROCESS OF PARTNER YOGA IS DESCRIBED FROM A TRANSPERSONAL, SOMATICALLY ORIENTED APPROACH. EXAMPLES OF SPECIFIC ASANAS, OR YOGA POSES, ARE DISCUSSED ALONGSIDE THE SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS THAT A THERAPIST MUST CONSIDER WHEN EXPLORING BOUNDARIES AND COMMUNICATION THROUGH PARTNER YOGA. INSIGHTS FROM INDIVIDUAL CASE SESSIONS WITH COUPLES ARE INCLUDED TO ILLUSTRATE THE PROCESS OF DIFFERENTIATION AND THE POSSIBILITY OF EXPERIENCING A TRANSPERSONAL UNION THROUGH PARTNER YOGA.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
11 1735  35 PHENOMENOLOGICAL INQUIRY INTO PHOENIX RISING YOGA THERAPY. THERE IS GROWING RECOGNITION WITHIN PSYCHOLOGY AND OTHER DISCIPLINES THAT BODY EXPERIENCE MAY BE AS IMPORTANT AS COGNITIVE AND EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE. HOWEVER, PSYCHOLOGY HAS FEW PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS TO SUPPORT THE INTEGRATION OF MIND AND BODY WITHIN THERAPY. PHOENIX RISING YOGA THERAPY (PRYT) IS A FORM OF MIND-BODY THERAPY THAT USES YOGA POSTURE, TOUCH, AND PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC DIALOGUE TO FACILITATE GROWTH AND HEALING. THE CURRENT STUDY EXPLORED THE PHENOMENOLOGICAL EXPERIENCE OF FOUR WOMEN WHO EACH RECEIVED FIVE PRYT SESSIONS. RESEARCH QUESTIONS POSED WERE: (1) WHAT ARE THE CLIENTS' EXPERIENCES OF THE PHENOMENA OF PRYT? AND (2) HOW DOES RECEIVING PRYT SESSIONS IMPACT THE CLIENTS' LIVES? THE FOLLOWING THEMES EMERGED FROM THE DATA AS THE ESSENCE OF PRYT SESSIONS: MINDFULNESS, SELF-AWARENESS, MIND-BODY CONNECTION, IN VIVO EXPERIENCE OF NEW BEHAVIORS, CLIENT-DIRECTED, EMPOWERMENT, AND LIFE CHANGES. THESE THEMES SHOW SIGNIFICANCE IN THE MIND-BODY CONNECTION AND THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE MODALITIES SUCH AS PRYT FOR CLIENTS. EACH PARTICIPANT NOTED GREATER INSIGHT INTO MIND-BODY CONNECTION. THEY NOTICED THE EFFECT OF COGNITION AND EMOTION ON THE BODY, OBSERVED HOW THE BODY CAN BE USED TO IMPROVE COPING THROUGH MOVEMENT AND BREATHING, AND EXPERIENCED DIFFERENT THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT AREAS OF THEIR BODIES. ALTHOUGH THESE RESULTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY GENERALIZABLE, THEY OFFER INTERESTING THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR EMBODIED INTERVENTIONS.	2018

SINCE 2015, A COMMUNITY AGENCY HAS IMPLEMENTED COMMUNITY-BASED, PEER-LED SUPPORT GROUPS FOR BHUTANESE REFUGEES, WITH 17 GROUPS IN 2018-2019. THIS STUDY DESCRIBES THE AGENCY'S QUALITY ASSURANCE EVALUATION THROUGH GROUP LEADER FEEDBACK, OBSERVATION REPORTS, AND FOCUS GROUPS. THE RESULTS OF 46 QUALITY ASSURANCE DOCUMENTS SHOW THAT THIS GROUP OF BHUTANESE REFUGEES PERCEIVE THEIR HEALTH THROUGH THE MIND-BODY CONNECTION, VIEWING PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH AS LINKED AND SUPPORTED BY YOGA, MINDFULNESS, EXERCISE, NUTRITION, AND CREATIVE EXPRESSION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
13 1878  30 REALIZING YOGA'S ALL-ACCESS PASS: A SOCIAL JUSTICE CRITIQUE OF WESTERNIZED YOGA AND INCLUSIVE EMBODIMENT. IN THE 21(ST) CENTURY, THE ANCIENT MIND-BODY PRACTICE OF YOGA HAS SURGED IN POPULARITY AMONG WESTERN ENTHUSIASTS FOR ITS NUMEROUS HEALTH BENEFITS. PARTICULARLY, A GROWING EVIDENCE BASE SUPPORTS YOGA FOR CULTIVATING POSITIVE EMBODIMENT AND REDUCING RISK FOR DISORDERED EATING. NEVERTHELESS, AMIDST ITS RISE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT YOGA'S DEPARTURE FROM ITS SPIRITUAL FOUNDATIONS AND INCREASING ASSIMILATION INTO THE APPEARANCE- AND COMMERCIAL-DRIVEN EXERCISE AND FITNESS CULTURE. CONSEQUENTLY, AN EXCLUSIONARY IDENTITY HAS BEEN PERPETUATED IN SHAPING NORMS SURROUNDING WHO CAN AND DOES PRACTICE YOGA, WHICH CONTRADICTS EARLIER EGALITARIAN VISIONS OF A YOGA FOR ALL. THEREFORE, WE ADOPT A SOCIAL JUSTICE LENS IN OFFERING A FOCUSED ANALYSIS OF THE INTERSECTION OF YOGA, EMBODIMENT, AND INCLUSION FOR SELECT MARGINALIZED SOCIAL IDENTITIES TYPICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND IN YOGA SCHOLARSHIP. DATA ARE SYNTHESIZED FROM BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE SOURCES AND INTEGRATE AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW CONFINED MEDIA REPRESENTATIONS OF "THE YOGA BODY" AND OTHER PRACTICAL CONSTRAINTS MAY UNDERMINE THE PERCEIVED ACCESS TO THE PRACTICE FOR MEMBERS OF DIVERSE GROUPS. WE CONCLUDE WITH INVITING FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS TOWARDS FOSTERING MORE INTERDISCIPLINARY COMMUNITY-BASED RESEARCH PARTNERSHIPS AMONG THE VARIETY OF STAKEHOLDERS INVESTED IN ADVANCING THE ACCESSIBILITY AND INCLUSION OF YOGA AND POSITIVE EMBODIMENT FOR ALL BODIES.	2020

15 2373  30 WHAT IS OUR "EPISTEMIC RESPONSIBILITY"? REFLECTIONS ON SOCIAL WORK'S ORIENTATION IN YOGA THERAPY RESEARCH. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO EXPLORE HOW THE SOCIAL WORK DISCIPLINE COULD PROVIDE A COMPLEMENTARY LENS THROUGH WHICH YOGA THERAPY CAN BE ANALYZED AND EVALUATED BY ENGAGING IN KNOWLEDGE-CREATION PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES THAT PRIORITIZE THE "EPISTEMIC RESPONSIBILITY" DESCRIBED BY PHILOSOPHER LORRAINE CODE. MORE SPECIFICALLY, BY SEEKING TO STRATEGICALLY INCLUDE OFTEN-SUBJUGATED TYPES OF KNOWLEDGE AND BY FOCUSING ON REDISTRIBUTING EPISTEMIC POWER TO AGENTS THAT TYPICALLY HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM EPISTEMIC PARTICIPATION IN CONTEMPORARY YOGA THERAPY RESEARCH, THE SOCIAL WORK DISCIPLINE, WITH ITS STRONG COMMITMENT TO SOCIAL JUSTICE, HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CONTRIBUTE TO FILLING AN IMPORTANT GAP IN SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE. WE BEGIN BY PRESENTING THE RELEVANCE OF THE SOCIAL WORK PERSPECTIVE IN RELATION TO THE FIELD OF YOGA THERAPY. WE NEXT OFFER A RESERVED CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE DOMINANT TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE BASE THAT CURRENTLY INFORMS YOGA THERAPY PRACTICE. THIS ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHTS THE SOCIAL PARAMETERS THAT MAY BE RENDERED INVISIBLE OR LEFT ASIDE WHEN ADOPTING A POSITIVIST EPISTEMOLOGICAL LENS AND JUSTIFIES HOW THE CONCEPTUAL APPARATUS OF EPISTEMIC RESPONSIBILITY SERVES AS A POTENTIAL PLATFORM FOR RETHINKING SOCIAL WORK'S POSITION AND FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FIELD OF YOGA THERAPY. FINALLY, WE MOBILIZE THE CONCEPT OF CULTURAL APPROPRIATION TO ILLUSTRATE HOW STRIVING FOR EPISTEMIC RESPONSIBILITY PROVIDES AN ENTRY POINT FOR ADDRESSING THE MULTILEVEL, COMPLEX SOCIAL PROCESSES EMBEDDED IN YOGA THERAPY PRACTICE AND RESEARCH WHILE AIMING TO CAPTURE THE MANY VOICES-AND HENCE THE VARIOUS TRUTHS-IMPLICATED IN A DEMOCRATIC, REFLEXIVE, AND INCLUSIVE RESEARCH PROCESS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
16 2517  20 YOGA COMMUNITIES AND EATING DISORDERS: CREATING SAFE SPACE FOR POSITIVE EMBODIMENT. WITH ADEQUATE EDUCATION AND GUIDANCE, YOGA COMMUNITIES, AS PART OF THE THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPE IN THE 21ST CENTURY, CAN PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE PROMOTING POSITIVE EMBODIMENT FOR THOSE WITH, AND AT-RISK FOR, EATING DISORDERS (EDS). TO DO THIS, YOGA TEACHERS NEED TO KNOW HOW TO CREATE A BODY-POSITIVE COMMUNITY AND BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE AND RESPOND TO THOSE AT RISK AND STRUGGLING WITH EDS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS YOGA TEACHING METHODS ASSOCIATED WITH EDS AND ED RISK, BROADER CONCEPTUAL APPROACHES AND SPECIFIC PRACTICES ASSOCIATED WITH POSITIVE EMBODIMENT ARE OFFERED. THESE INCLUDE THE BROADER CONCEPTUAL APPROACHES OF: INTENTIONAL INCLUSION AND ACCEPTANCE, EXPERIENTIAL EMPHASIS, SUPPORTING POSITIVE EMBODIMENT AND INQUIRY. STUDIO PRAGMATICS ARE ALSO DETAILED AS RELATED TO THE BODY, BREATH, EMOTIONS, AND COMMUNITY.

17 2239  23 THE IMPORTANCE OF RESEARCH LITERACY FOR YOGA THERAPISTS. EVIDENCE-INFORMED PRACTICE (EIP) UTILIZES THE THREE COMPONENTS OF EXPERT OPINION, RESEARCH EVIDENCE, AND CLIENT VALUES. IT IS A RECOMMENDED TRAINING COMPETENCY FOR INTEGRATIVE HEALTH PRACTITIONERS IN DIVERSE FIELDS, SUCH AS ACUPUNCTURE AND MASSAGE THERAPY. RESEARCH LITERACY (RL) IS A NECESSARY PRE-REQUISITE TO EIP. MANY YOGA THERAPISTS HAVE LIMITED TRAINING IN THESE SKILLS, WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTS INTER-PROFESSIONAL COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION, AS WELL AS FURTHER ADVANCEMENT OF YOGA THERAPY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE.

OUTCOMES DEMONSTRATE PROMISE FOR BOTH ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY. CURRICULUM TOOLS WERE VIEWED AS EFFECTIVE, AND PARTICIPANTS INDICATED INTENTION TO BOTH UTILIZE AND SHARE TOOLS. REFLECTIONS ON PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS AND IMPACTS ARE ADDRESSED, AS ARE POTENTIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR IMPROVED PROGRAM TRANSLATION. FINDINGS SUGGEST THE POTENTIAL BENEFIT FOR FUTURE COLLABORATIONS, AND ALSO SUGGEST BEST PRACTICES CONSIDERATIONS FOR GLOBAL IMPLEMENTATION OF EMBODIED MINDFULNESS PROGRAMMING.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
19   10  41 "MAKING IT OKAY": PROFESSIONALS IN HIGH-STRESS ENVIRONMENTS CONSTRUCT THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT OF A YOGA-BASED RETREAT DESIGNED TO BUILD RESILIENCE. PURPOSE: WHILE THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE FOR RESILIENCE BUILDING PROGRAMMES, TO DATE RESEARCH HAS NOT EXPLORED HOW PROFESSIONALS CONSTRUCT UNDERSTANDING OF PROGRAMME IMPACT. RISE (RESILIENCE, INTEGRATION, SELF-AWARENESS, ENGAGEMENT), A 5-DAY YOGA-BASED RETREAT PROGRAMME, HAS BEEN LINKED WITH POSITIVE WELLNESS OUTCOMES. THIS QUALITATIVE INQUIRY EXPLORES PARTICIPANTS' REFLECTION AND EXPERIENCE 3 MONTHS AFTER PROGRAMME COMPLETION. METHODS: THROUGH A GROUNDED CONSTRUCTIVIST LENS, IN-DEPTH SEMI-STRUCTURED PHONE INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH 17 ADULT PROFESSIONALS IN HIGH-STRESS WORK ENVIRONMENTS WHO ATTENDED RISE. INITIAL HAND-CODING INFORMED CODEBOOK DEVELOPMENT FOR SYSTEMATIC CODING USING DIRECTED CONTENT ANALYSIS USING SENSITIZING STRUCTURING. RESULTS: TWO INTEGRATED PERCEPTIONS WOVEN THROUGH FIVE THEMES. PERSISTENT THREADS OF EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING AND SENSE OF PERMISSION PROVIDED STRUCTURE FOR THEMES FOUND. FIVE INTERRELATED THEMES RELATED TO PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH AND WORKPLACE DYNAMICS WERE (1) USE OF ACQUIRED BEHAVIOURAL SKILLS AND PRACTICES; (2) LIVED MINDFULNESS; (3) RESILIENCE TO STRESS AND EMOTION REGULATION (4) SELF-CARE AND SELF-COMPASSION, AND (5) SHARING WITH OTHERS. CONCLUSION: FINDINGS PROVIDE MEANINGFUL INTERPRETATION OF PREVIOUSLY REPORTED PROGRAMME EFFICACY BY CONTEXTUALIZING PERCEIVED BENEFITS WITHIN PARTICIPANTS' CONSTRUCTED UNDERSTANDING OF CHANGE. SPECIFICALLY, ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND EXPERIENTIAL CONSIDERATIONS HAVE SUGGESTED IMPLICATIONS FOR RESILIENCE BUILDING PROGRAMMES.ABBREVIATIONS: RISE (RESILIENCE, INTEGRATION, SELF-AWARENESS, ENGAGEMENT).	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
20  126  34 A PILOT STUDY TO ADAPT A TRAUMA-INFORMED, MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION FOR JUSTICE-INVOLVED YOUTH. THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO ADAPT AND PILOT A TRAUMA-INFORMED, MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA (TIMBY) INTERVENTION FOCUSED ON ENHANCING SELF-REGULATION AMONG YOUTH IN THE GEORGIA DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. IN THIS ARTICLE WE (1) DESCRIBE THE PROCESS BY WHICH WE SYSTEMATICALLY ADAPTED AN EVIDENCE-BASED PROTOCOL SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS POPULATION, (2) DESCRIBE THE NATURE OF AND RATIONALE FOR THOSE ADAPTATIONS, (3) PRESENT SOME PRELIMINARY QUALITATIVE FINDINGS BASED ON INTERVIEWS WITH YOUTH PARTICIPANTS, AND (4) BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE HOW THE ADAPTED PROTOCOL WILL BE EVALUATED IN THE SUBSEQUENT FEASIBILITY TRIAL. THE ITERATIVE DRAFTING AND REVISION PROCESS INVOLVED MODIFICATIONS TO A WELL-ESTABLISHED, PROTOCOLIZED TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA PROGRAM AND WAS IDENTIFIED BY THE PROJECT ADVISORY BOARD AND T H ROUGH FORMAL INTERVIEWS WITH INTERVENTION STAFF. QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH YOUTH PARTICIPANTS CONCERNING INTERVENTION IMPACT, CREDIBILITY, AND SATISFACTION. SEVERAL NEEDED MODIFICATIONS WERE IDENTIFIED SO THAT THE INTERVENTION WOULD BE CONTEXTUALLY APPROPRIATE FOR JUSTICE-INVOLVED YOUTH. THIRTY YOUTH WERE ENROLLED IN THE PILOT STUDY: 77% WE RE NON - HISPANIC BLACK/AFRICAN-AMERICAN, 18% WERE NON-HISPANIC WHITE, AND 5% WERE HISPANIC WHITE. THE AVERAGE AGE WAS 16.45 YEARS (RANGE 14-20). THE YOUTH CONSISTENTLY REPORTED SATISFACTION WITH THE SESSIONS AND POSITIVE BELIEFS ABOUT HOW THE SESSIONS WERE HELPING THEM WITH A RANGE OF PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL/ EMOTIONAL CHALLENGES. ADAPTATIONS TO THE PROTOCOL IN THE PRESENT STUDY HIGHLIGHT HOW MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR JUSTICE-INVOLVED YOUTH NEED TO CONSIDER WHAT IS BOTH DEVELOPMENTALLY SUITABLE FOR YOUTH AND APPROPRIATE IN A JUSTICE SETTING. A FEASIBILITY STUDY USING THIS REVISED TIMBY PROTOCOL IS UNDERWAY AT FOUR GEORGIA DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE JUSTICE FACILITIES TO FORMALLY IDENTIFY THE BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO IMPLEMENTATION FOR THE PRESENT STUDY AND A FUTURE, LARGER-SCALE TRIAL.	2021

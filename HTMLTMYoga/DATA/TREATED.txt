1  704 88 EFFECT OF INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA AND NATUROPATHY ON POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME: A CASE STUDY. OWING TO STRESS, SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE AND CHANGES IN DIET PATTERN, THERE IS AN INCREASE IN THE SURGE OF LIFESTYLE AND METABOLIC DISORDERS. POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME (PCOS) AFFECTS 8-13% OF REPRODUCTIVE-AGED WOMEN. PCOS IS CHARACTERISED BY MENSTRUAL IRREGULARITY, HYPERANDROGENISM AND POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN MORPHOLOGY (PCOM). THE EFFICACY OF YOGA AS A THERAPY TO TACKLE THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT CAUSE OF AILMENT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PCOS IS TO BE DOCUMENTED. THIS IS THE CASE STUDY OF A FEMALE PATIENT AGE 25 YEARS, A DIAGNOSED CASE OF PCOS WAS REGISTERED AT THE AYURVEDA, YOGA, UNANI,SIDDHA,HOMEOPATHY (AYUSH), YOGA OPD, WITH COMPLAINTS OF IRREGULAR MENSTRUATION, TREATED SUCCESSFULLY BY YOGA AND NATUROPATHY (Y AND N), I.E., YOGA, DIET AND LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION. THIS IS EVIDENT FROM THE REDUCTION IN WEIGHT, REGULARISATION OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE ALONG WITH MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE OVARY AFTER A FOLLOW-UP OF 6 MONTHS.	2022

3  275 17 ADDITIONAL EFFECT OF IYENGAR YOGA AND EMG BIOFEEDBACK ON PAIN AND FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY IN CHRONIC UNILATERAL KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS. BACKGROUND: THERE ARE LIMITED DATA ABOUT IYENGAR YOGA AND EMG BIOFEEDBACK IN KNEE OA, ALTHOUGH THE EFFICACY OF EMG BIOFEEDBACK IN THE REHABILITATION OF PATIENTS WITH QUADRICEPS MUSCLE WEAKNESS SECONDARY TO IMMOBILIZATION, CONTRACTURE, AND JOINT SURGERY HAS BEEN WELL ESTABLISHED. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIRTY SUBJECTS WHO HAVE FULFILLED INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA WERE SELECTED AND DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS (GROUP A AND B). BOTH THE GROUPS WERE TREATED WITH EMG BIOFEEDBACK, KNEE MUSCLE STRENGTHENING EXERCISES, AND TENS. GROUP A RECEIVED ADDITIONALLY IYENGAR YOGA FOR 8 WEEKS. BOTH GROUPS WERE EVALUATED BY VISUAL ANALOG SCALE AND MODIFIED WOMAC-WESTERN ONTARIO MCMASTER UNIVERSITIES SCALE. RESULTS: PATIENTS IN BOTH GROUPS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PAIN AND IMPROVEMENT IN FUNCTIONAL ABILITY. IN VAS SCALE GROUP A SHOWED REDUCTION OF 56.83% (P = 0.001) WHEN COMPARED WITH GROUP B 38.15% (P </= 0.001). IN MODIFIED WOMAC SCALE, GROUP A SHOWED REDUCTION OF 59.21% (P = 0.001) WHEN COMPARED WITH GROUP B 34.08% (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: ADDING IYENGAR YOGA ALONG WITH CONVENTIONAL THERAPY PROVIDES BETTER RESULTS IN CHRONIC UNILATERAL KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS IN TERMS OF PAIN AND FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY.	2013

THESE PATIENTS WERE DEMONSTRATED "SHAVASANA" AND TRAINED TO PERFORM IT CORRECTLY. SHAVASANA THERAPY WAS CONTINUED FOR SIX MONTHS. THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT FALL IN BOTH MEAN SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC PRESSURE OF BOTH GROUPS. FURTHER, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DOSES OF ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS, BEING GIVEN TO PATIENTS OF GROUP B. IN 65% PATIENTS OF GROUP A, BLOOD PRESSURE COULD BE CONTROLLED WITH SHAVASANA ONLY AND NO DRUG WAS NEEDED IN THEM AT ALL. BLOOD PRESSURE ROSE SIGNIFICANTLY TO PRE-SHAVASANA LEVELS IN PATIENTS WHO LEFT PRACTISING YOGA. THUS, WITH USE OF YOGA (SHAVASANA) IN THERAPY OF HYPERTENSION, REQUIREMENT OF ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED AND IN SOME CASES MAY BE TOTALLY DISPENSED WITH AND IT MAY BE AN USEFUL ADJUNCT IN TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION.	1984	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
6 2283 30 THE USE OF INTEGRATIVE THERAPY BASED ON YOGA AND AYURVEDA IN THE TREATMENT OF A HIGH-RISK CASE OF COVID-19/SARS-COV-2 WITH MULTIPLE COMORBIDITIES: A CASE REPORT. BACKGROUND: WE REPORT A HIGH-RISK CASE OF A CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 19 (COVID-19)-POSITIVE PATIENT WITH COMORBIDITIES INCLUDING DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), HYPERTENSION (HTN), HYPOTHYROIDISM AND CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (CKD), TREATED SUCCESSFULLY USING AN INTEGRATIVE THERAPY PLAN BASED ON AYURVEDA AND YOGA, ALONG WITH GOVERNMENT-MANDATED COMPULSORY MODERN WESTERN MEDICINE (MWM) TREATMENT. RECENTLY, SOME EVIDENCE HAS BEEN EMERGING ON THE USE OF AYURVEDA FOR TREATMENT OF COVID-19. THE CLASSICAL TEXTS OF AYURVEDIC MEDICINE SUCH AS CHARAKA SAMHITA AND SUSHRUTA SAMHITA CONTAIN DESCRIPTIONS OF PANDEMICS OF SIMILAR PROPORTIONS AND DESCRIBE THEM AS JANAPADODDHVANSA, MEANING THE DESTRUCTION OF COMMUNITIES, ALONG WITH THEIR CAUSES AND TREATMENT. CASE PRESENTATION: THE CASE REPORTED HEREIN IS A 55-YEAR-OLD MAN FROM DELHI, INDIA, WITH CONFIRMED (TESTED) COVID-19, WHO FIRST TOOK MWM FOR 7 DAYS BEFORE SEEKING INTEGRATIVE THERAPY. THE PATIENT HAS COMORBIDITIES INCLUDING DM, HTN, HYPOTHYROIDISM AND CKD AND HAD DEVELOPED SYMPTOMS INCLUDING FEVER (WHICH WAS RESOLVED BY THE TIME INTEGRATIVE THERAPY WAS STARTED), SORE THROAT, DRY COUGH, BODY ACHES, WEAKNESS, BAD TASTE AND SMELL, AND HEAVINESS IN THE ABDOMEN. BASED ON THE PATIENT'S SYMPTOMS AND COMORBIDITIES, A TREATMENT PLAN INCLUDING AYURVEDIC MEDICINES, YOGA PROTOCOL, DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS AND LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS WAS PRESCRIBED BY A REGISTERED AYURVEDA DOCTOR AND A YOGA CONSULTANT. THE PATIENT STARTED EXPERIENCING IMPROVEMENT IN ALL THE SYMPTOMS WITHIN 2 DAYS AFTER STARTING THE TREATMENT; HE REPORTED APPROXIMATELY [FORMULA: SEE TEXT] RELIEF FROM THE SYMPTOMS AFTER 5 DAYS, AND ALMOST COMPLETE RELIEF WITHIN 9 DAYS. ALSO, THE BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS (BOTH FASTING BLOOD SUGAR [FBS] AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD SUGAR [PPBS]) EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT AFTER 5 DAYS, AND DECREASED TO WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE WITHIN 12 DAYS. BESIDES RELIEF IN SYMPTOMS, THE PATIENT'S REAL-TIME REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (RT-PCR) TEST DONE ON THE 19TH DAY RETURNED NEGATIVE RESULTS. CONCLUSIONS: INTEGRATIVE THERAPY WAS FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE IN MITIGATING THE SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19 IN THIS PATIENT WITH MULTIPLE COMORBIDITIES. MOREOVER, A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS (NOT UNDER CONTROL WITH MODERN MEDICINE) WAS ALSO ACHIEVED. INTEGRATIVE THERAPY BASED ON THE CLASSICAL TEXTS OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA MAY OFFER A PROMISING AND SCALABLE TREATMENT OPTION FOR COVID-19 PATIENTS. A CASE SERIES OR A SUITABLY DESIGNED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IS NEEDED TO ASSESS ITS EFFICACY.	2021	

7  774 28 EFFECT OF YOGA AND NATUROPATHY ON DISEASE ACTIVITY AND SYMPTOM BURDENS IN A PATIENT WITH ACTIVE ULCERATIVE COLITIS: A CASE REPORT. OBJECTIVES: ULCERATIVE COLITIS (UC) IS A CHRONIC IDIOPATHIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE THAT AFFECTS THE LARGE BOWEL. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO FIND THE EFFECT OF YOGA AND NATUROPATHY (YN) IN A PATIENT WITH ACTIVE MODERATE PANCOLITIS. CASE PRESENTATION: AN 18-YEAR OLD UNMARRIED FEMALE DIAGNOSED WITH UC IN 2017. PATIENT'S SYMPTOMS BEGAN WITH ABDOMINAL PAIN, NAUSEA, VOMITING AND DIARRHEA WITH/WITHOUT BLOOD STAINS MORE THAN SEVEN TIMES A DAY, DAILY. THE SYMPTOMS REDUCED AFTER TAKING REGULAR CONVENTIONAL MEDICATION FOR A PERIOD OF ONE-YEAR. HOWEVER, IN FEBRUARY-2019, THE PATIENT VISITED OUR HOSPITAL WITH THE SAME COMPLAINTS AND RECEIVED 21-DAYS OF YN TREATMENTS. RESULTS SHOWED A BETTER REDUCTION IN THE ABDOMINAL PAIN, DISEASE ACTIVITY, STRESS AND DEPRESSION AND A BETTER IMPROVEMENT IN HEMOGLOBIN LEVELS, QUALITY OF SLEEP, AND QUALITY OF LIFE WITH NO ADVERSE EFFECTS. CONCLUSIONS: YN COULD BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE THERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF UC. HOWEVER, FURTHER STUDIES ARE REQUIRED TO WARRANT THIS EFFECT.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
8  740 20 EFFECT OF RAJYOGA MEDITATION ON CHRONIC TENSION HEADACHE. CHRONIC TENSION-TYPE HEADACHE (CTTH) IS THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF HEADACHE WITH NO TRULY EFFECTIVE TREATMENT. THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO CORRELATE THE ADDITIVE EFFECT OF MEDITATION ON CTTH PATIENTS RECEIVING MEDICAL TREATMENT. 50 PATIENTS (AGED 18-58 YEARS) PRESENTING WITH A CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS OF CCTH, WERE DIVIDED IN 2 GROUPS. GROUP 1 (N=30) RECEIVED 8 LESSONS AND PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATION OF BRAHMAKUMARIS SPIRITUAL BASED MEDITATION KNOWN AS RAJYOGA MEDITATION FOR RELAXATION THERAPY, IN ADDITION TO ROUTINE MEDICAL TREATMENT (ANALGESICS AND MUSCLE RELAXANTS). GROUP 2 (N=20) PATIENTS RECEIVED ANALGESICS AND MUSCLE RELAXANTS TWICE A DAY BUT NO RELAXATION THERAPY IN THE FORM OF MEDITATION. BOTH GROUPS WERE FOLLOWED UP FOR 8 WEEKS PERIOD. THE PARAMETERS STUDIED WERE SEVERITY, FREQUENCY AND DURATION OF CCTH, AND THEIR HEADACHE INDEX CALCULATED. PATIENTS IN BOTH GROUPS SHOWED A HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN HEADACHE VARIABLES (P<0.001) AFTER 8 WEEKS. BUT THE PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS SHOWING HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT RELIEF IN SEVERITY OF HEADACHE, DURATION & FREQUENCY IN GROUP 1 WAS 94%, 91% AND 97% RESPECTIVELY WHEREAS IN GROUP 2 IT WAS 36%, 36% AND 49% RESPECTIVELY. HEADACHE RELIEF AS CALCULATED BY HEADACHE INDEX WAS 99% IN GROUP 1 AS COMPARED TO 51% IN GROUP 2. EVEN SHORT TERM SPIRITUAL BASED RELAXATION THERAPY (RAJYOGA MEDITATION) WAS HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN CAUSING EARLIER RELIEF IN CHRONIC TENSION HEADACHE AS MEASURED BY HEADACHE PARAMETER.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
9  718 22 EFFECT OF INTEGRATIVE NATUROPATHY AND YOGA IN A PATIENT WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS ASSOCIATED WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES AND HYPERTENSION. A 54-YEAR OLD MARRIED WOMAN WAS DIAGNOSED WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS IN 2002, ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION IN 2008, TYPE-2 DIABETES IN 2011 AND GANGRENE OVER 2(ND) TOE OF RIGHT FOOT. SHE UNDERWENT CONVENTIONAL MANAGEMENT IN PRIVATE HOSPITALS. HER SYMPTOMS, BEGAN WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE PAIN ASSOCIATED WITH SWELLING, STIFFNESS (MORE IN THE MORNING) IN MULTIPLE JOINTS ESPECIALLY OVER SMALL JOINTS. IN JULY-2014 SHE VISITED OUR COLLEGE HOSPITAL WITH THE COMPLAINTS OF PAIN, MILD SWELLING AND STIFFNESS OVER MULTIPLE JOINTS ASSOCIATED WITH POOR QUALITY OF SLEEP (QOS) AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). SUBJECT RECEIVED INTEGRATIVE NATUROPATHY AND YOGA THERAPIES (INYT) WITH CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE DAILY FOR 10-DAYS. AFTER 10-DAYS, IMPROVEMENTS IN PAIN, BLOOD SUGAR, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, STRESS, QOS, QOL, BLOOD ANALYSIS WITH NORMAL BLOOD PRESSURE (BP) WAS OBSERVED. THIS SUGGESTS THAT INYT COULD BE CONSIDERED AS AN ADJUVANT TO CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE IN RA ASSOCIATED WITH TYPE-2 DIABETES AND ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION.	2017

THIS HAS LED TO THE VIOLATION OF THE STANDARD INDICATIONS AND WHEN KNEES ARE REPLACED IGNORING OTHER CO - MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS IT RESULTS IN THE SURGERY FAILING EARLY. THIS IS ABOUT A PATIENT WHO ENCOUNTERED A FAILED TKR DUE TO IMPROPER SELECTION AS PATIENT HAD BILATERAL OA HIP THAT WAS IGNORED IN THE INITIAL STAGES. TO OVERCOME THE PROBLEM SHE WAS ADVISED BILATERAL HIP REPLACEMENT WHICH WOULD LEAVE HER WITH FOUR REPLACEMENTS IN THE LOWER LIMB. SHE REFUSED SURGERY AND WAS TOLD THERE ARE NO ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS. THIS PATIENT UNDERWENT A 3 WEEK INTEGRATED COURSE OF IAYT AT OUR CENTER AND SHE MADE A REMARKABLE RECOVERY. IAYT IS A GOOD NON-SURGICAL TREATMENT THAT CAN BE AFFECTIVE BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER KNEE REPLACEMENT AND IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS THE FIRST CHOICE OF TREATMENT BEFORE SURGERY.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
11 1381 22 IMPACT OF NATUROPATHY, YOGA, AND DIETARY INTERVENTIONS AS ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF STAGE II AND III ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE COLON. INTRODUCTION: NATUROPATHY, YOGA AND DIETARY INTERVENTIONS ARE KNOWN TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN CANCER PATIENTS. WE AIM TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF NATUROPATHY INTERVENTIONS ALONG WITH ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY IN PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT SURGERY FOR ADENOCARCINOMA OF THE COLON. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 116 ADULT PATIENTS WERE RANDOMISED IN TO ONE OF THE TWO GROUPS; THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP RECEIVED NATUROPATHY, YOGA AND DIETARY INTERVENTIONS AND THE CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED PSYCHO-SOCIAL COUNSELLING IN ADDITION TO STANDARD CHEMOTHERAPY. HAEMATOLOGICAL, BIOCHEMICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATIONS WERE PERFORMED AT SET INTERVALS DURING A TOTAL PERIOD OF EIGHTEEN MONTHS STARTING FROM THE FIRST CYCLE OF ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY. RESULTS: RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE OVERALL HEMOGLOBIN (P < 0.0001) AND CARCINOEMBRYONIC ANTIGEN (CEA) (P = 0.0038) LEVELS WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IN PATIENTS ON THE EXPERIMENTAL ARM. THE REST OF THE LABORATORY PARAMETERS, VIZ. TOTAL LEUKOCYTE COUNT, PLATELET COUNTS, AND SERUM CREATININE LEVELS, FOR OVERALL DATA WAS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IN BOTH THE GROUPS. PSYCHOLOGICAL ATTRIBUTES SUCH AS ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, SYMPTOM SEVERITY, AND FUNCTIONAL LIVING INDEX: CANCER (FLIC) WERE FOUND TO BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.0001) IN THE EXPERIMENTAL SUBJECTS AS COMPARED WITH THOSE IN THE CONTROL. ON THE WHOLE, MEN BENEFITED MORE THAN WOMEN FROM THE STUDY INTERVENTIONS. CONCLUSIONS: WE CONCLUDE THAT YOGA AND NATUROPATHY INTERVENTIONS IN ADDITION TO CHEMOTHERAPY SHOW IMPROVEMENT IN OVERALL FUNCTIONAL LIFE INDEX ALONG WITH IMPROVEMENT IN HAEMOGLOBIN IN PATIENTS WITH STAGES II AND III ADENOCARCINOMA OF COLON.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
12 1644 25 MORBIDITY PROFILE OF PATIENTS SEEKING NATUROPATHY AND YOGA TREATMENT IN SOUTH INDIA: A DESCRIPTIVE STUDY. BACKGROUND YOGA AND NATUROPATHY (Y&N) IS ONE OF THE APPROVED COMPLEMENTARY AND TRADITIONAL SYSTEMS OF MEDICINE PRACTICED IN INDIA. UNLIKE OTHER SYSTEMS, IT IS A DRUGLESS SYSTEM AIMED TO OPTIMIZE AND FACILITATE THE INHERENT ABILITY OF THE HUMAN BODY TO HEAL ITSELF. THERE IS LACK OF LITERATURE ON THE TYPE OF PATIENTS SEEKING YOGA AND NATUROPATHY TREATMENTS IN INDIA. THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED WITH AN OBJECTIVE TO ASSESS THE MORBIDITY PROFILE OF THE IN-PATIENTS TREATED IN A NATUROPATHY AND YOGA HOSPITAL. METHODS DESCRIPTIVE STUDY DESIGN BASED ON CLINICAL CASE RECORDS. SIX HUNDRED AND FOUR CASES TREATED AS IN-PATIENTS BETWEEN APRIL 2017 AND JULY 2018 WAS ANALYZED. RESULTS THE AVERAGE AGE OF THE PATIENTS WAS 47.4 (SD +/- 16.1) YEARS, WITH 56% WERE FEMALES AND 44% MALES. ABOUT 50 DIFFERENT TYPES OF MORBIDITY RANGING FROM GENERAL REJUVENATION TO CHRONIC DISEASES HAD BEEN REPORTED. HIGHEST REPORTED DISEASES WERE CHRONIC IN NATURE, WITH HIGHER REPORTING FOR MULTIPLE SYSTEM MORBIDITY, FOLLOWED BY OBESITY, DIABETES MELLITUS, HYPERTENSION, ARTHRITIS, AND BACK PAIN. VARIATIONS WERE OBSERVED IN THE MORBIDITIES BASED ON AGE AND GENDER OF THE PATIENTS. THE MEDIAN DURATION OF TREATMENT WAS 8DAYS. CONCLUSIONS PATIENTS SEEK YOGA & NATUROPATHY CARE MAINLY FOR CHRONIC CONDITIONS, FURTHER OBSERVATIONS ON TREATMENT OUTCOMES, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND TREATMENT SEEKING BEHAVIOR CAN BE EXPLORED FOR THE EFFICACY AND FEASIBILITY OF YOGA & NATUROPATHY CARE IN MANAGING CHRONIC DISEASES.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
13 1818 24 PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF STANDARD ANTIEMETIC THERAPY WITH YOGA VERSUS STANDARD ANTIEMETIC THERAPY ALONE FOR HIGHLY EMETOGENIC CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA AND VOMITING IN SOUTH ASIAN POPULATION. AIM/BACKGROUND: CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA AND VOMITING (CINV) IS ONE OF THE MOST DISTRESSING SIDE EFFECTS OF HIGHLY EMETOGENIC CHEMOTHERAPY REGIMENS. THERE HAVE BEEN CONTINUOUS EFFORTS IN THE DIRECTION TO CONTROL CINV BY MANY INVESTIGATORS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RANDOMLY SELECTED PATIENTS WERE THOSE RECEIVING HIGHLY EMETOGENIC CHEMOTHERAPY REGIMEN GROUPED INTO YOGA AND STANDARD ANTIEMETIC THERAPY (N = 50) JUST BEFORE RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY AND CONTINUED FOR THE FOLLOWING DAYS AND OTHER GROUP (N = 50) RECEIVED ONLY THE STANDARD ANTIEMETIC AGENT. BOTH THE GROUPS WERE ASSESSED, FOLLOWED FOR ACUTE AND DELAYED ONSET OF CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED AND ANTICIPATORY NAUSEA AND VOMITING USING RADIATION THERAPY ONCOLOGY GROUP GRADING FOR THE SAME. WE ALSO ASSESSED THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF THE PATIENT USING THE FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CANCER THERAPY-GENERAL QUESTIONNAIRE. RESULTS: THE MEDIAN AGE GROUP OF THE PATIENTS WAS 51 YEARS WITH MALE:FEMALE RATIO 2:1, THE EASTERN COOPERATIVE ONCOLOGY GROUP (ECOG) PERFORMANCE STATUS WAS 0/1 IN 38% OF THE SELECTED POPULATION, WHILE ECOG 2 IN 62% OF THE PATIENTS. IN YOGA ARM, INSIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA (90% VS. 78%, P = 0.35) AND BUT SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN VOMITING (42% VS. 22%, P =0.01) WAS OBSERVED AS COMPARED TO THE STANDARD ANTIEMETICS ONLY ARM. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN GRADE 2 AND 3 NAUSEA (84% VS. 38% P < 0.01) AND VOMITING (14% VS. 0% P < 0.01). QUALITY OF LIFE IS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED IN THE YOGA ARM, ESPECIALLY IN THE ECOG 2 PERFORMANCE STATUS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY CONCLUDES THAT YOGA ALONG WITH STANDARD ANTIEMETIC MEDICATION SHOULD BE A PART OF THE MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR THE CANCER PATIENTS RECEIVING HIGHLY EMETOGENIC CHEMOTHERAPY.	2019

PARTICIPANTS WERE 30 PATIENTS WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA IN CARE AT THE REHABILITATIVE PSYCHIATRY AND RESEARCH VILLA CHIARA CLINIC IN MASCALUCIA (CATANIA, ITALY), AFTER THAT RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO TWO GROUPS. THE FIRST GROUP FOLLOWED THE EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT WITH SETS OF YOGA EXERCISES CONDUCTED BY A YOGA TRAINER AND A PSYCHIATRIST OR A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST EXPERT IN YOGA, WHILE A SECOND CONTROL GROUP WAS TREATED WITH USUAL CARE. THE RESULTS REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE, BEFORE AND AFTER TREATMENT, BETWEEN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND THE CONTROL GROUP IN QUALITY OF LIFE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
15 1904 22 RETARDATION OF CORONARY ATHEROSCLEROSIS WITH YOGA LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION. BACKGROUND: YOGA HAS POTENTIAL FOR BENEFIT FOR PATIENTS WITH CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE THOUGH OBJECTIVE, ANGIOGRAPHIC STUDIES ARE LACKING. MATERIAL AND METHODS: WE EVALUATED POSSIBLE ROLE OF LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION INCORPORATING YOGA, ON RETARDATION OF CORONARY ATHEROSCLEROTIC DISEASE. IN THIS PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL, 42 MEN WITH ANGIOGRAPHICALLY PROVEN CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD) WERE RANDOMIZED TO CONTROL (N = 21) AND YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 21) AND WERE FOLLOWED FOR ONE YEAR. THE ACTIVE GROUP WAS TREATED WITH A USER-FRIENDLY PROGRAM CONSISTING OF YOGA, CONTROL OF RISK FACTORS, DIET CONTROL AND MODERATE AEROBIC EXERCISE. THE CONTROL GROUP WAS MANAGED BY CONVENTIONAL METHODS I.E. RISK FACTOR CONTROL AND AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION STEP I DIET. RESULTS: AT ONE YEAR, THE YOGA GROUPS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN NUMBER OF ANGINAL EPISODES PER WEEK, IMPROVED EXERCISE CAPACITY AND DECREASE IN BODY WEIGHT. SERUM TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, LDL CHOLESTEROL AND TRIGLYCERIDE LEVELS ALSO SHOWED GREATER REDUCTIONS AS COMPARED WITH CONTROL GROUP. REVASCULARISATION PROCEDURES (CORONARY ANGIOPLASTY OR BYPASS SURGERY) WERE LESS FREQUENTLY REQUIRED IN THE YOGA GROUP (ONE VERSUS EIGHT PATIENTS; RELATIVE RISK = 5.45; P = 0.01). CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY REPEATED AT ONE YEAR SHOWED THAT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LESIONS REGRESSED (20% VERSUS 2%) AND LESS LESIONS PROGRESSED (5% VERSUS 37%) IN THE YOGA GROUP (CHI-SQUARE = 24.9; P < 0.0001). THE COMPLIANCE TO THE TOTAL PROGRAM WAS EXCELLENT AND NO SIDE EFFECTS WERE OBSERVED. CONCLUSION: YOGA LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION RETARDS PROGRESSION AND INCREASES REGRESSION OF CORONARY ATHEROSCLEROSIS IN PATIENTS WITH SEVERE CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE. IT ALSO IMPROVES SYMPTOMATIC STATUS, FUNCTIONAL CLASS AND RISK FACTOR PROFILE.	2000	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
16 1532 23 IYENGAR YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION FOR ISCHIAL PRESSURE ULCERS IN A PATIENT WITH AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS: A CASE STUDY. BACKGROUND: ALTHOUGH SOME RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT THE FORMATION OF PRESSURE ULCERS IS RARE IN PATIENTS WITH AMYOTROPHIC LATERAL SCLEROSIS (ALS), SEVERAL PATIENTS HAVE NONETHELESS DEVELOPED THIS PROBLEM. TO DATE, HOWEVER, NO CASE REPORTS IN THE LITERATURE HAVE DESCRIBED PATIENTS WITH ALS WHO DEVELOP ISCHIAL PRESSURE ULCERS. OUTSIDE OF THE ALS LITERATURE, EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT ISCHIAL PRESSURE ULCERS FREQUENTLY DEVELOP IN WHEELCHAIR USERS AND ALSO IN PATIENTS TREATED IN VARIOUS HEALTH CARE SETTINGS. CASE DESCRIPTION: A PATIENT DIAGNOSED WITH ALS REPORTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF ISCHIAL PRESSURE ULCERS AFTER CONSISTENT IMMOBILITY FOR 1 YEAR (32 MONTHS AFTER HER ALS DIAGNOSIS). THIS PATIENT, WHO WAS SITTING ON THE WOUNDS, WAS TREATED WITH OINTMENT AND MORPHINE; THE LATTER WAS INEFFECTIVE IN CONTROLLING THE PAIN. MOVING THE PATIENT FROM SITTING TO SUPINE, LATERAL, OR SEMILATERAL POSITIONS, EITHER ON THE BED OR WHEELCHAIR, TO SEPARATE THE ULCERS FROM THE SURFACE OF THE CHAIR OR BED WAS DEEMED IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE OF EXAGGERATION OF OTHER SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND PAIN IN OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY. A NEW METHOD OF POSTURAL ALIGNMENT WAS DEVELOPED TO ALLEVIATE THE PAIN ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRESSURE ULCER. THIS METHOD, IYENGAR YOGA THERAPY, WHICH USES PROPS TO REPOSITION A PATIENT, ALLEVIATED PAIN AND HEALING OF TWO PRESSURE ULCERS OF THE PATIENT AFTER 3 WEEKS OF STARTING THIS INTERVENTION. CONCLUSION: ALTHOUGH THE ISCHIAL PRESSURE ULCERS WERE SUCCESSFULLY TREATED IN A PATIENT WITH ALS, FURTHER STUDY IS NECESSARY TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS POSTURAL ALIGNMENT INTERVENTION IN ALS AND OTHER PATIENT POPULATIONS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF ISCHIAL PRESSURE ULCERS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
17 1401 26 IMPACT OF YOGA ON BIOCHEMICAL PROFILE OF ASTHMATICS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. BACKGROUND: ASTHMA IS A CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY DISORDER OF THE AIRWAYS. THE CHRONIC INFLAMMATION CAUSES AN ASSOCIATED INCREASE IN AIRWAY HYPERRESPONSIVENESS THAT LEADS TO RECURRENT EPISODES OF WHEEZING, BREATHLESSNESS, CHEST TIGHTNESS, AND COUGHING AT NIGHT OR IN THE EARLY MORNING. MOST OF THE STUDIES HAVE REPORTED, AS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON BRONCHIAL ASTHMA, SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN PULMONARY FUNCTIONS, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND DECREASE IN MEDICATION USE, BUT NONE OF THE STUDIES HAS ATTEMPTED TO SHOW THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON BIOCHEMICAL CHANGES. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON BIOCHEMICAL PROFILE OF ASTHMATICS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IN THE PRESENT STUDY, 276 PATIENTS OF MILD TO MODERATE ASTHMA (FEV 1> 60%) AGED BETWEEN 12 TO 60 YEARS WERE RECRUITED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PULMONARY MEDICINE, KING GEORGE'S MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, U.P., LUCKNOW, INDIA. THEY WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: YOGA GROUP (WITH STANDARD MEDICAL TREATMENT AND YOGIC INTERVENTION) AND CONTROL GROUP AS STANDARD MEDICAL TREATMENT (WITHOUT YOGIC INTERVENTION). AT COMPLETION OF 6 MONTHS OF THE STUDY PERIOD, 35 SUBJECTS WERE DROPPED OUT, SO OUT OF 276 SUBJECTS, ONLY 241 SUBJECTS COMPLETED THE WHOLE STUDY (121 SUBJECTS FROM YOGA GROUP AND 120 SUBJECTS FROM CONTROL GROUP). BIOCHEMICAL ASSESSMENT WAS CARRIED OUT AT BASELINE AND AFTER 6 MONTHS OF THE STUDY PERIOD. RESULTS: IN YOGA GROUP, THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT FOUND IN THE PROPORTION OF HEMOGLOBIN AND ANTIOXIDANT SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE IN COMPARISON TO CONTROL GROUP AND SIGNIFICANT DECREASE WAS FOUND IN TOTAL LEUKOCYTE COUNT (TLC) AND DIFFERENTIAL LEUKOCYTES COUNT IN COMPARISON TO CONTROL GROUP. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE FOUND IN TLC, POLYMORPHS, AND MONOCYTES IN BETWEEN GROUP COMPARISON. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA GROUP GOT SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER IMPROVEMENT IN BIOCHEMICAL VARIABLES THAN CONTROL GROUP. RESULT SHOWS THAT YOGA CAN BE PRACTICED AS ADJUVANT THERAPY WITH STANDARD INHALATION THERAPY FOR BETTER OUTCOME OF ASTHMA.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
18 1915 27 ROLE OF NATUROPATHY AND YOGA TREATMENT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION. AIM: THE PRIMARY AIM WAS TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF NATUROPATHY AND YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN TREATMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE HYPERTENSION. DESIGN: THE VARIABLES OF INTEREST WERE MEASURED AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE INTERVENTION USING A PRE-POST DESIGN. SETTING: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED BY INYS MEDICAL RESEARCH SOCIETY IN JINDAL NATURE CURE INSTITUTE, BANGALORE. SUBJECTS: A TOTAL OF 104 SUBJECTS, ALREADY DIAGNOSED WITH MILD TO MODERATE HYPERTENSION AND ON TREATMENT WITH ANTIHYPERTENSIVE MEDICINES WERE INCLUDED IN STUDY. INTERVENTIONS: THE INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF VARIOUS INPATIENT ADMINISTRATION OF DIFFERENT NATUROPATHY TREATMENTS, YOGA THERAPIES, LOW CALORIE AND LOW SODIUM DIET FOR 21 DAYS. ANTIHYPERTENSIVE MEDICINES WERE WITHDRAWN FOR SOME PATIENTS IN ONE WEEK BASED UPON RESPONSE TO THE TREATMENT. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE OUTCOME MEASURES WERE VALUES OF DIASTOLIC AND SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND BODY WEIGHT. SUBJECTS WERE FOLLOWED FOR A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR AFTER EVERY 3 MONTHS. RESULTS: AFTER STARTING NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACH OF NATUROPATHY AND YOGA, SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE CAME DOWN FROM MEAN OF 139.6 TO 129.6 WHERE AS IT CAME DOWN FROM 91.2 TO 86.1 FOR DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE. AT THE SAME TIME FAVORABLE EFFECT WAS ALSO SEEN IN OTHER VARIABLES LIKE LIPID PROFILE AND BODY WEIGHT. AT THE END OF ONE YEAR OUT OF 57 PATIENTS WHO CAME FOR FOLLOW-UP, 14 CASES WERE FOUND TO HAVE BLOOD PRESSURE WITHIN NORMAL RANGES WITHOUT ANY MEDICATION OVER THE PREVIOUS 12 MONTHS. CONCLUSION: NATUROPATHY AND YOGA THERAPY CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A VALUABLE NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACH IN TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
19  840 33 EFFECT OF YOGA ON POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME (PCOS) IS NOT A DISEASE BUT A MERE SYNDROME. MANY RESEARCHERS HAVE STUDIED POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME AND FOUND THAT THERE IS NO PROPER CAUSE OF THAT, IT MAY OCCUR DUE TO HORMONAL IMBALANCE OR STRESS, OR DUE TO A SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE. THE RATE OF POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME IN INDIAN WOMEN HAS BEEN INCREASING RAPIDLY. THE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE ACNE, WEIGHT GAIN, HIRSUTISM, DIFFICULTIES IN FERTILITY, IRREGULAR OR INFREQUENT PERIODS, IMMATURE OVARIAN EGGS THAT DO NOT OVULATE, MULTIPLE CYSTS IN THE OVARY. IF LEFT UNTREATED, IT MAY BECOME THE CAUSE FOR HEART DISEASES, DIABETES, HYPERTENSION, INFERTILITY, AND EVEN CANCER. THERE ARE VARIETIES OF MEDICAL TREATMENTS AVAILABLE TO TREAT POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME BUT THEY HAVE A TEMPORARY EFFECT AND IF TAKEN FOR A LONG TIME THEN IT MAY LEAD TO SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS. YOGA HAS PROVEN EFFECTS IN REDUCING AND MANAGING THE SYMPTOMS OF POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME MORE EFFECTIVELY ALONG WITH MEDICINE. THIS REVIEW WORK HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO CONSIDER THE AVAILABLE LITERATURE CONCERNING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME. IT INCLUDES SOME RESEARCH PAPERS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 2012 AND 2019. BY PROVIDING YOGIC TREATMENT EFFECT ON SEVERAL PARAMETERS (SUCH AS BLOOD LIPID LEVEL, GLUCOSE METABOLISM, ENDOCRINE PARAMETERS, QUALITY OF LIFE, RESTING CARDIOVASCULAR PARAMETERS, LEVEL OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION) ON THE WOMAN WITH POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME WERE MEASURED. AFTER THOROUGHLY STUDYING ABOUT 74 RESEARCH PAPERS, 16 ARE FOUND MOST RELEVANT TO BE REVIEWED. THE STUDIES OF THESE PAPERS CONCLUDED THE SUCCESSFUL USE OF DIFFERENT YOGIC LIMBS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME WITH OR WITHOUT MEDICATIONS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
20 1011 30 EFFECTS OF NATUROPATHY AND YOGA INTERVENTION ON CD4 COUNT OF THE INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY-REPORT FROM A HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS SANATORIUM, PUNE. BACKGROUND: HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) INFECTION IS ONE OF THE MOST DEBILITATING CONDITIONS WHICH HAVE AFFECTED NEARLY 32 MILLION PEOPLE ACROSS THE GLOBE. ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY (ART) IS THE STANDARD CARE GIVEN TO THE HIV POSITIVE INDIVIDUALS. BUT THE PATIENT ADHERENCE TO ART IS FOUND TO BE VERY LESS AS PER PREVIOUS STUDIES. COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE IS BECOMING A PILLAR IN THE REHABILITATIVE EFFORTS FOR MANY LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS. AIM: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF NATUROPATHY AND YOGA INTERVENTION ON CD4 COUNTS OF HIV PATIENTS. METHODS: NINETY-SIX PATIENTS PREDIAGNOSED AS HIV POSITIVE WERE ENROLLED AFTER OBTAINING WRITTEN CONSENT AND TREATED WITH NATUROPATHY AND YOGA INTERVENTIONS LIKE HYDROTHERAPY, DIET THERAPY, MUD THERAPY, COUNSELING, ETC., FOR VARIOUS DURATIONS AT NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NATUROPATHY SANATORIUM. THEY WERE GROUPED INTO FOUR GROUPS (G1: 1-7 DAYS, G2: 8-15 DAYS, G3: 16-30 DAYS, G4: >30 DAYS) BASED ON DURATION OF STAY. CD4 COUNT OF EACH INDIVIDUAL WAS RECORDED PRE- AND POST-STAY. RESULTS: ALL ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED USING R PACKAGE VERSION 3.01. DEPENDENT SAMPLE T-TESTS WERE CONDUCTED TO EXAMINE THE SIGNIFICANCE AT 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL. OF THE 96 PATIENTS, MALE PATIENTS CONSTITUTE 55.2% AND FEMALE PATIENTS 44.8% WITH MEAN AGE 34.74 RECEIVED 1-180 DAYS (MEAN 28.75, STANDARD DEVIATION: 14.16) TREATMENT. SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE CD4 COUNT WAS OBSERVED IN TWO OUT OF THE FOUR GROUPS (G2: P = 0.052, AND G4: P = 0.00038, RESPECTIVELY). CONCLUSION: AN INCREASING TREND IN THE CD4 COUNT WAS OBSERVED THAT WAS PROPORTIONAL TO THE LENGTH OF THE STAY OF PARTICIPANTS AT THE HIV SANATORIUM. THIS INDICATES THE POSSIBILITY OF LIFESTYLE CHANGES CAN BRING POSITIVE OUTCOMES IN PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS WHEN USED AS AN ADJUVANT WITH ART CARE. THE LACK OF CONTROL GROUP IS A MAJOR LIMITATION OF THIS STUDY. NO ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO STUDY THE SUBJECTIVE CHANGES IN THE QUALITY OF LIFE, VIRAL LOAD, ETC., HOWEVER, LARGER CONTROLLED STUDIES ARE WARRANTED FOR CONCLUSIVE RESULTS.	2015

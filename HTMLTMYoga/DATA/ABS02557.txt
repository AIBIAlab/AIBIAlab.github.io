1 2557 156 YOGA FOR CHRONIC CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY PAIN: A PILOT, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. PURPOSE: TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR CANCER SURVIVORS WITH CHRONIC CIPN PAIN, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF THE INTERVENTION ON PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES. METHODS: CANCER SURVIVORS WITH CHRONIC CIPN PAIN WERE RECRUITED FROM THE BREAST, GASTROINTESTINAL, AND GYNECOLOGICAL ONCOLOGY CENTERS AT DANA-FARBER CANCER INSTITUTE. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED (2:1) TO RECEIVE AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION OR USUAL CARE. AFTER 21/50 OF PARTICIPANTS WERE ENROLLED, THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC REQUIRED THE YOGA INTERVENTION TO BE DELIVERED VIRTUALLY (I.E., ZOOM). PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION, PARTICIPANTS SELF-REPORTED CIPN AND CO-OCCURRING SYMPTOM SEVERITY. ADHERENCE TO THE INTERVENTION WAS DEFINED AS PRACTICING >/= 12 YOGA SESSIONS OVER THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION PERIOD. CHANGES IN PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES BETWEEN GROUPS WERE COMPARED USING WILCOXON'S RANK-SUM TESTS. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS (N = 28 YOGA, N = 16 CONTROL) WERE MAINLY FEMALE (96%) AND DIAGNOSED WITH STAGE III/IV DISEASE (66%). OVERALL, 19/28 (67.8%) OF YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS WERE ADHERENT TO THE YOGA PROTOCOL. YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT WITHIN-GROUP IMPROVEMENTS IN ALL PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES, INCLUDING WORST CIPN PAIN (MEDIAN CHANGE = - 1.7, P < 0.0001) AND SENSORY CIPN (MEDIAN CHANGE = - 14.8, P < 0.0001), BUT ONLY IMPROVEMENTS IN FATIGUE (P = 0.05) AND DEPRESSION (P = 0.04) WERE SIGNIFICANT COMPARED TO THE CONTROL. THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES (P > 0.05) IN CHANGES IN PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES BETWEEN IN-PERSON (N = 6) OR VIRTUAL (N = 15) YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA IS A FEASIBLE NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL MODALITY FOR CANCER SURVIVORS WITH CIPN, BUT MORE INFORMATION IS NEEDED REGARDING ITS IMPACT ON CIPN AND OTHER SYMPTOMS. TRIAL REGISTRATION: CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT03824860 IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: ONCOLOGY CLINICIANS MAY CONSIDER REFERRING CANCER SURVIVORS TO YOGA FOR CHRONIC CIPN PAIN, BUT YOGA CANNOT BE CURRENTLY RECOMMENDED AS AN EFFICACIOUS TREATMENT.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
2 2549  57 YOGA FOR CANCER SURVIVORS WITH CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY: HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS A MEDITATIVE MOVEMENT THERAPY FOCUSED ON MIND-BODY AWARENESS. THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS WITH CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY (CIPN) IS UNCLEAR. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A PILOT RANDOMIZED WAIT-LIST CONTROLLED TRIAL OF 8 WEEKS OF YOGA (N = 21) VERSUS WAIT-LIST CONTROL (N = 20) FOR CIPN IN 41 BREAST AND GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER SURVIVORS WITH PERSISTENT MODERATE TO SEVERE CIPN. HRQOL ENDPOINTS WERE HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE (HADS), BRIEF FATIGUE INVENTORY (BFI), AND INSOMNIA SEVERITY INDEX (ISI). THE TREATMENT EXPECTANCY SCALE (TES) WAS ADMINISTERED AT BASELINE. WE ESTIMATED MEAN CHANGES AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CIS) FROM BASELINE TO WEEKS 8 AND 12 AND COMPARED ARMS USING CONSTRAINED LINEAR MIXED MODELS. RESULTS: AT WEEK 8, HADS ANXIETY SCORES DECREASED -1.61 (-2.75, -0.46) IN THE YOGA ARM AND -0.32 (-1.38, 0.75) POINTS IN THE WAIT-LIST CONTROL ARM (P = 0.099). AT WEEK 12, HADS ANXIETY SCORES DECREASED -1.42 (-2.57, -0.28) IN YOGA COMPARED TO AN INCREASE OF 0.46 (-0.60, 1.53) IN WAIT-LIST CONTROL (P = 0.017). THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN HADS DEPRESSION, BFI, OR ISI SCORES BETWEEN YOGA AND WAIT-LIST CONTROL. BASELINE TES WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN YOGA THAN IN WAIT-LIST CONTROL (14.9 VS. 12.7, P = 0.019). TES WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH HADS ANXIETY REDUCTION AND HADS ANXIETY REDUCTION WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH CIPN PAIN REDUCTION. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA MAY REDUCE ANXIETY IN PATIENTS WITH CIPN. FUTURE STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE FINDINGS.

3 2604  56 YOGA FOR PERSISTENT FATIGUE IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE AFFLICTS UP TO 33% OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS, YET THERE ARE NO EMPIRICALLY VALIDATED TREATMENTS FOR THIS SYMPTOM. METHODS: THE AUTHORS CONDUCTED A 2-GROUP RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFICACY OF AN IYENGAR YOGA INTERVENTION FOR BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WITH PERSISTENT POST-TREATMENT FATIGUE. PARTICIPANTS WERE BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WHO HAD COMPLETED CANCER TREATMENTS (OTHER THAN ENDOCRINE THERAPY) AT LEAST 6 MONTHS BEFORE ENROLLMENT, REPORTED SIGNIFICANT CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, AND HAD NO OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT WOULD ACCOUNT FOR FATIGUE SYMPTOMS OR INTERFERE WITH YOGA PRACTICE. BLOCK RANDOMIZATION WAS USED TO ASSIGN PARTICIPANTS TO A 12-WEEK, IYENGAR-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION OR TO 12 WEEKS OF HEALTH EDUCATION (CONTROL). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS CHANGE IN FATIGUE MEASURED AT BASELINE, IMMEDIATELY POST-TREATMENT, AND 3 MONTHS AFTER TREATMENT COMPLETION. ADDITIONAL OUTCOMES INCLUDED CHANGES IN VIGOR, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, SLEEP, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE. INTENT-TO-TREAT ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED WITH ALL RANDOMIZED PARTICIPANTS USING LINEAR MIXED MODELS. RESULTS: THIRTY-ONE WOMEN WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO YOGA (N = 16) OR HEALTH EDUCATION (N = 15). FATIGUE SEVERITY DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM BASELINE TO POST-TREATMENT AND OVER A 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP IN THE YOGA GROUP RELATIVE TO CONTROLS (P = .032). IN ADDITION, THE YOGA GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN VIGOR RELATIVE TO CONTROLS (P = .011). BOTH GROUPS HAD POSITIVE CHANGES IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND PERCEIVED STRESS (P < .05). NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN SLEEP OR PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE WERE OBSERVED. CONCLUSIONS: A TARGETED YOGA INTERVENTION LED TO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN FATIGUE AND VIGOR AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WITH PERSISTENT FATIGUE SYMPTOMS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
4 2096  51 THE EFFECT OF YOGA EXERCISE ON IMPROVING DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND FATIGUE IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND FATIGUE ARE AMONG THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS THAT INFLUENCE THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER WHO RECEIVE ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY. ALTHOUGH EVIDENCE HAS SHOWN YOGA TO DECREASE ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER, FEW STUDIES ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA HAVE TARGETED PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. YOGA INTERVENTIONS SHOULD BE TESTED TO PROMOTE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH OF WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER. PURPOSE: THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AN 8-WEEK YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM IN PROMOTING THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH OF WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER UNDERGOING ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY IN TERMS OF DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND FATIGUE. METHODS: A SAMPLE OF 60 WOMEN WITH NONMETASTATIC BREAST CANCER WAS RECRUITED. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED INTO EITHER THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (N = 30) OR THE CONTROL GROUP (N = 30). A 60-MINUTE, TWICE-PER-WEEK YOGA EXERCISE WAS IMPLEMENTED FOR 8 WEEKS AS THE INTERVENTION FOR THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP. THE CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED STANDARD CARE ONLY. RESULTS: ANALYSIS USING THE JOHNSON-NEYMAN PROCEDURE FOUND THAT THE YOGA EXERCISE REDUCED OVERALL FATIGUE AND THE INTERFERENCE OF FATIGUE IN EVERYDAY LIFE FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PARTICIPANTS. SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS WERE OBTAINED AFTER 4 WEEKS OF INTERVENTION PARTICIPATION FOR THOSE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PATIENTS WITH RELATIVELY LOW STARTING BASELINE VALUES (BASELINE ITEM MEAN VALUE < 3.31 AND 3.22, RESPECTIVELY) AND AFTER 8 WEEKS FOR MOST PATIENTS (APPROXIMATELY 75%) WITH MODERATE STARTING BASELINE VALUES (BASELINE ITEM MEAN VALUE < 7.30 AND 5.34, RESPECTIVELY). THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE LEVELS OF DEPRESSION (F = 1.29, P > .05) OR ANXIETY (F = 2.7, P > .05). CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: THE 8-WEEK YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM DEVELOPED IN THIS STUDY EFFECTIVELY REDUCED FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER BUT DID NOT REDUCE DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY. ONCOLOGY NURSES SHOULD STRENGTHEN THEIR CLINICAL HEALTH EDUCATION AND APPLY YOGA TO REDUCE THE FATIGUE EXPERIENCED BY PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER WHO UNDERGO ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
5   70  50 A FEASIBILITY STUDY EXAMINING THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON PSYCHOSOCIAL HEALTH AND SYMPTOMS IN PEDIATRIC OUTPATIENTS RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY. PURPOSE: PEDIATRIC CANCER PATIENTS EXPERIENCE SYMPTOMS THAT NEGATIVELY IMPACT QUALITY OF LIFE; YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE WAS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF A 10-WEEK, WEEKLY INDIVIDUALIZED YOGA INTERVENTION FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS RECEIVING OUTPATIENT CANCER THERAPY PRIMARILY DELIVERED REMOTELY USING SKYPE. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES WERE TO DESCRIBE DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, ANGER, FATIGUE, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND SYMPTOMS AT 5 AND 10 WEEKS AFTER ENROLLMENT. METHODS: WE INCLUDED ENGLISH-SPEAKING PATIENTS AGED 10 TO 18 YEARS RECEIVING OUTPATIENT CHEMOTHERAPY FOR CANCER. WEEKLY INDIVIDUALIZED YOGA SESSIONS WERE OFFERED FOR 10 WEEKS. WEEKS 1, 5, AND 10 WERE IN-HOSPITAL WHILE THE REMAINING SESSIONS WERE DELIVERED REMOTELY USING SKYPE. TWICE WEEKLY, HOMEWORK WAS ASSIGNED BETWEEN EACH SESSION. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS FEASIBILITY, DEFINED AS 80% OF PARTICIPANTS COMPLETING AT LEAST 60% OF PLANNED IN-HOSPITAL OR REMOTE YOGA SESSIONS. RESULTS: BETWEEN MARCH AND NOVEMBER 2017, 10 PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED. TWO PATIENTS DISCONTINUED THE STUDY AFTER ONE AND TWO SESSIONS. ONLY SIX PARTICIPANTS ACHIEVED AT LEAST 60% OF PLANNED YOGA SESSIONS AND THUS, THE STUDY DID NOT MEET THE A PRIORI DEFINED FEASIBILITY THRESHOLD. AMONG ALL PARTICIPANTS, ONLY ONE HOMEWORK SESSION WAS PERFORMED. CONCLUSIONS: A 10-WEEK INDIVIDUALIZED IN-PERSON AND REMOTELY CONDUCTED YOGA INTERVENTION WAS NOT FEASIBLE IN CHILDREN RECEIVING CANCER TREATMENTS BECAUSE OF FAILURE TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED FREQUENCY OF YOGA SESSIONS IN A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD IDENTIFY APPROACHES TO IMPROVE COMPLIANCE WITH REMOTE YOGA SESSIONS AND HOME PRACTICE.

6 1389  47 IMPACT OF SOMATIC YOGA AND MEDITATION ON FALL RISK, FUNCTION, AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY SYNDROME IN CANCER SURVIVORS. OBJECTIVE: CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY (CIPN) SYNDROME CAUSES SIGNIFICANT PAIN AS AN ADVERSE EFFECT OF TREATMENT, WITH FEW NONPHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS TESTED. A SOMATIC YOGA AND MEDITATION (SYM) INTERVENTION ON FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) WAS INVESTIGATED. DESIGN AND METHODS: INDIVIDUALS DIAGNOSED WITH CIPN WERE ENROLLED IN AN OPEN-LABEL, SINGLE-ARM, MIXED-METHODS FEASIBILITY TRIAL. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: IN AN OUTPATIENT REHABILITATION CENTER, TEN PARTICIPANTS WITH MEDIAN AGE 64.4 YEARS (47-81) ATTENDED 61% OF THE SESSIONS WITH NO ADVERSE EVENTS. INTERVENTION: SYM TWICE A WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS FOR 1.5 HOURS, WITH HOME PROGRAM AND JOURNALING. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PRIMARY FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES INCLUDED SIT AND REACH (SR), FUNCTIONAL REACH (FR), AND TIMED UP AND GO (TUG). SELF-REPORTED PATIENT NEUROTOXICITY QUESTIONNAIRE (PNQ) AND FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CANCER THERAPY-NEUROTOXICITY (FACT-GOG-NTX) WERE SECONDARY CIPN OUTCOMES. BIOMARKERS INCLUDED SALIVARY CORTISOL (STRESS) AND BIOESTHESIOMETER (VIBRATION). RESULTS: QUANTITATIVE FINDINGS. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE FOUND IN FLEXIBILITY (SR; P = .006); BALANCE (FR; P = .001) AND FALL RISK (TUG; P = .004). PNQ IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY ( P = .003) WITH OTHER MEASURES IMPROVING NON-SIGNIFICANTLY. QUALITATIVE FINDINGS. FIVE THEMES EMERGED: (1) VACILLATION OF CIPN PAIN PERCEPTION OVER TIME; (2) TRANSFERABILITY OF SKILLS TO DAILY ACTIVITIES; (3) IMPROVEMENT IN PHYSICAL FUNCTION; (4) PERCEIVED RELAXATION AS AN EFFECT OF SYM; AND (5) GROUP ENGAGEMENT PROVIDED A SOCIAL CONTEXT FOR NOT FEELING ISOLATED WITH CIPN. CONCLUSION: PRELIMINARY DATA SUGGEST SYM MAY IMPROVE QOL, FLEXIBILITY, AND BALANCE IN CANCER SURVIVORS WITH CIPN, WITH A FULLY POWERED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL INDICATED.

7 2605  41 YOGA FOR PERSISTENT FATIGUE IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS: RESULTS OF A PILOT STUDY. APPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS EXPERIENCES PERSISTENT FATIGUE FOR MONTHS OR YEARS AFTER SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT COMPLETION. THERE IS A LACK OF EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENTS FOR CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, PARTICULARLY AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS. THIS SINGLE-ARM PILOT STUDY EVALUATED THE FEASIBILITY AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR FATIGUED BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS BASED ON THE IYENGAR TRADITION. IYENGAR YOGA PRESCRIBES SPECIFIC POSES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SPECIFIC MEDICAL PROBLEMS AND CONDITIONS; THIS TRIAL EMPHASIZED POSTURES BELIEVED TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR REDUCING FATIGUE AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS, INCLUDING INVERSIONS AND BACKBENDS PERFORMED WITH THE SUPPORT OF PROPS. TWELVE WOMEN WERE ENROLLED IN THE TRIAL, AND 11 COMPLETED THE FULL 12-WEEK COURSE OF TREATMENT. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN FATIGUE SCORES FROM PRE- TO POST-INTERVENTION THAT WAS MAINTAINED AT THE 3-MONTH POST-INTERVENTION FOLLOWUP. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE ALSO OBSERVED IN MEASURES OF PHYSICAL FUNCTION, DEPRESSED MOOD, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. THESE RESULTS SUPPORT THE ACCEPTABILITY OF THIS INTERVENTION AND SUGGEST THAT IT MAY HAVE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON PERSISTENT POST-TREATMENT FATIGUE. HOWEVER, RESULTS REQUIRE REPLICATION IN A LARGER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
8 1242  47 FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA INTERVENTION TO DECREASE PAIN IN OLDER WOMEN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF OLDER WOMEN SUFFER FROM CHRONIC PAIN, WHICH CAN DECREASE QUALITY OF LIFE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PILOT RANDOMIZED STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF A FLOW-RESTORATIVE YOGA INTERVENTION DESIGNED TO DECREASE PAIN AND RELATED OUTCOMES AMONG WOMEN AGED 60 OR OLDER. METHODS: FLOW-RESTORATIVE YOGA CLASSES WERE HELD TWICE WEEKLY FOR 1 HOUR AND LED BY A CERTIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTOR. PARTICIPANTS RANDOMIZED TO THE INTERVENTION GROUP ATTENDED THE YOGA CLASSES FOR 12 WEEKS AND RECEIVED SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS FOR AT-HOME PRACTICE. THOSE RANDOMIZED TO THE CONTROL GROUP WERE ASKED TO MAINTAIN THEIR NORMAL DAILY ROUTINE. FEASIBILITY WAS EVALUATED USING RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION RATES, CLASS AND HOME PRACTICE ADHERENCE RATES, AND PARTICIPANT SATISFACTION SURVEYS. OUTCOME MEASURES (SELF-REPORTED PAIN, INFLAMMATORY MARKERS, FUNCTIONAL FITNESS, QUALITY OF LIFE, RESILIENCE, AND SELF-REPORTED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY) WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION. PAIRED T-TESTS OR WILCOXON SIGNED-RANK TESTS WERE USED TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN OUTCOME MEASURES WITHIN TREATMENT GROUPS. RESULTS: THIRTY-EIGHT PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED. PARTICIPANTS WERE PRIMARILY WHITE, COLLEGE-EDUCATED, AND HIGHER FUNCTIONING, DESPITE EXPERIENCING VARIOUS FORMS OF CHRONIC PAIN. ATTENDANCE AND RETENTION RATES WERE HIGH (91 AND 97%, RESPECTIVELY) AND THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS WERE SATISFIED WITH THE YOGA PROGRAM (89%) AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS (87%). INTERVENTION PARTICIPANTS ALSO EXPERIENCED REDUCTIONS IN PAIN INTERFERENCE AND IMPROVEMENTS IN ENERGY AND SOCIAL FUNCTIONING. CONCLUSIONS: THIS PILOT STUDY PROVIDES ESSENTIAL DATA TO INFORM A FULL SCALE RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF FLOW-RESTORATIVE YOGA FOR OLDER WOMEN WITH CHRONIC PAIN. FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD EMPHASIZE STRATEGIES TO RECRUIT A MORE DIVERSE STUDY POPULATION, PARTICULARLY OLDER WOMEN AT HIGHER RISK OF DISABILITY AND FUNCTIONAL DECLINE.

9 2508  54 YOGA BREATHING FOR CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY-ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE: RESULTS OF A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: MANY DEBILITATING SYMPTOMS ARISE FROM CANCER AND ITS TREATMENT THAT ARE OFTEN UNRELIEVED BY ESTABLISHED METHODS. PRANAYAMA, A SERIES OF YOGIC BREATHING TECHNIQUES, MAY IMPROVE CANCER-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE, BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED FOR THIS PURPOSE. OBJECTIVES: A PILOT STUDY WAS PERFORMED TO EVALUATE FEASIBILITY AND TO TEST THE EFFECTS OF PRANAYAMA ON CANCER-ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE. DESIGN: THIS WAS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL COMPARING PRANAYAMA TO USUAL CARE. SETTING: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT A UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER. SUBJECTS: PATIENTS RECEIVING CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE PRANAYAMA IMMEDIATELY OR AFTER A WAITING PERIOD (CONTROL GROUP). INTERVENTIONS: THE PRANAYAMA INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF FOUR BREATHING TECHNIQUES TAUGHT IN WEEKLY CLASSES AND PRACTICED AT HOME. THE TREATMENT GROUP RECEIVED PRANAYAMA DURING TWO CONSECUTIVE CYCLES OF CHEMOTHERAPY. THE CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED USUAL CARE DURING THEIR FIRST CYCLE, AND RECEIVED PRANAYAMA DURING THEIR SECOND CYCLE OF CHEMOTHERAPY. OUTCOME MEASURES: FEASIBILITY, CANCER-ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS (FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, STRESS), AND QUALITY OF LIFE WERE THE OUTCOMES. RESULTS: CLASS ATTENDANCE WAS NEARLY 100% IN BOTH GROUPS. SIXTEEN (16) PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL INTENT-TO-TREAT ANALYSES. THE REPEATED-MEASURES ANALYSES DEMONSTRATED THAT ANY INCREASE IN PRANAYAMA DOSE, WITH DOSE MEASURED IN THE NUMBER OF HOURS PRACTICED IN CLASS OR AT HOME, RESULTED IN IMPROVED SYMPTOM AND QUALITY-OF-LIFE SCORES. SEVERAL OF THESE ASSOCIATIONS--SLEEP DISTURBANCE (P=0.04), ANXIETY (P=0.04), AND MENTAL QUALITY OF LIFE (P=0.05)--REACHED OR APPROACHED STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA BREATHING WAS A FEASIBLE INTERVENTION AMONG PATIENTS WITH CANCER RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY. PRANAYAMA MAY IMPROVE SLEEP DISTURBANCE, ANXIETY, AND MENTAL QUALITY OF LIFE. A DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP WAS FOUND BETWEEN PRANAYAMA USE AND IMPROVEMENTS IN CHEMOTHERAPY-ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE. THESE FINDINGS NEED TO BE CONFIRMED IN A LARGER STUDY.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
10  428  38 CAN YOGA HAVE ANY EFFECT ON SHOULDER AND ARM PAIN AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER? A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED, SINGLE-BLIND TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SHOULDER AND ARM PAIN, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), DEPRESSION, AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. METHODS: THIS PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED STUDY INCLUDED 42 PATIENTS. THE PATIENTS IN GROUP 1 UNDERWENT A 10-WEEK HATHA YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM. THE PATIENTS IN GROUP 2 WERE INCLUDED IN A 10-WEEK FOLLOW-UP PROGRAM. OUR PRIMARY ENDPOINT WAS ARM AND SHOULDER PAIN INTENSITY. RESULTS: THE GROUP RECEIVING YOGA SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR PAIN SEVERITY FROM BASELINE TO POST-TREATMENT, AND THESE BENEFITS WERE MAINTAINED AT 2.5 MONTHS POST-TREATMENT. WHEN COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP, THERE WERE NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 2 GROUPS WITH RESPECT TO THE PARAMETERS ASSESSED AT THE END OF WEEK 10. CONCLUSION: YOGA WAS AN EFFECTIVE AND SAFE EXERCISE FOR ALLEVIATING SHOULDER AND ARM PAIN, WHICH IS A COMPLICATION WITH A HIGH PREVALENCE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
11 2553  34 YOGA FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS AFTER COMPLETING CANCER TREATMENT. SURVIVORS OF CHILDHOOD CANCER MAY EXPERIENCE PERSISTENT SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, AND BALANCE IMPAIRMENT. YOGA IS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY THAT IMPROVES FATIGUE, SLEEP, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN ADULT CANCER SURVIVORS. USING A ONE GROUP, REPEATED MEASURES DESIGN, WE EVALUATED THE FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA PROGRAM AND ASSESSED IF CANCER SURVIVOR PARTICIPANTS AGES 10 TO 17 YEARS (N = 13) HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LESS FATIGUE AND ANXIETY, AND BETTER BALANCE AND SLEEP, AFTER A 6-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION COMPARED WITH A 6-WEEK PRE-INTERVENTION WAIT PERIOD. STUDY RECRUITMENT WAS CHALLENGING WITH A 32% ENROLLMENT RATE; YOGA ATTENDANCE WAS 90%. NONE OF THE SCORES FOR ANXIETY, FATIGUE, SLEEP, AND BALANCE HAD SIGNIFICANT CHANGES DURING THE WAIT PERIOD. AFTER THE 6-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM, CHILDREN (N = 7) HAD A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN ANXIETY SCORE (P = .04) WHILE ADOLESCENT SCORES (N = 7) SHOWED A DECREASING TREND (P = .10). SCORES FOR FATIGUE, SLEEP, AND BALANCE REMAINED STABLE POST-INTERVENTION. FATIGUE AND BALANCE SCORES WERE BELOW NORMS FOR HEALTH CHILDREN/ADOLESCENTS WHILE SLEEP AND ANXIETY SCORES WERE SIMILAR TO HEALTHY PEERS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
12 1232  52 FEASIBILITY AND POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF PARTNER-SUPPORTED YOGA ON PSYCHOSOCIAL AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION AMONG LUNG CANCER PATIENTS. OBJECTIVE: PATIENTS WITH LUNG CANCER EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN PSYCHOSOCIAL AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION DURING AND AFTER TREATMENT THAT IMPACT QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AND SURVIVAL. YOGA IS A POTENTIAL STRATEGY TO MITIGATE FUNCTIONAL DECLINE AMONG PATIENTS WITH LUNG CANCER. METHODS: A SINGLE GROUP 12-WEEK PILOT TRIAL OF LOW-MODERATE INTENSITY YOGA AMONG PATIENTS WITH STAGE I-IV LUNG CANCER AND THEIR PARTNERS (N = 46; 23 PATIENT-PARTNER DYADS) DURING CANCER TREATMENT FROM TWO HOSPITAL SYSTEMS. FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY, DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS, AND COHEN D EFFECT SIZES WERE CALCULATED AT 6 AND 12-WEEKS FOR PSYCHOSOCIAL AND PHYSICAL OUTCOMES USING VALIDATED QUESTIONNAIRES AND ASSESSMENTS. RESULTS: AT 6 AND 12-WEEKS, RETENTION WAS 65% AND WITHDRAWALS WERE MAINLY DUE TO DISEASE PROGRESSION. AMONG STUDY COMPLETERS (N = 26; 13 DYADS) ADHERENCE WAS 80%. COMPARING BASELINE TO 12-WEEK MEASUREMENTS, FATIGUE, DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS, AND SLEEP DISTURBANCE IMPROVED IN 54% OF PARTICIPANTS FOR ALL THREE MEASURES (COHEN'S D = 0.40-0.53). QOL IMPROVED IN 77% OF PARTICIPANTS (COHEN'S D = 0.34). UPPER AND LOWER BODY FLEXIBILITY, AND LOWER BODY STRENGTH IMPROVED IN 92%, 85% AND 77% OF PARTICIPANTS, RESPECTIVELY (COHEN'S D = 0.39-1.08). SIX-MINUTE WALK TEST IMPROVED IN 62% OF PARTICIPANTS AN AVERAGE OF 32 METERS (SD = 11.3; COHEN'S D = 0.17). NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS: AMONG PATIENTS WITH STAGE I-IV LUNG CANCER INCLUDING ACTIVE TREATMENT, A 12-WEEK PARTNER-SUPPORTED YOGA PROGRAM IS FEASIBLE, ACCEPTABLE, AND IMPROVED PSYCHOSOCIAL AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION. LOW-INTENSITY YOGA MAY BE A COMPLIMENTARY APPROACH TO REDUCE THE EFFECTS OF CANCER TREATMENT, HOWEVER, MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF PARTNER-SUPPORTED YOGA TO MITIGATE FUNCTIONAL DECLINE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
13 1865  50 RANDOMIZED PILOT TRIAL OF YOGA VERSUS STRENGTHENING EXERCISES IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WITH CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE. PURPOSE: FATIGUE IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON AND BOTHERSOME REFRACTORY SYMPTOMS EXPERIENCED BY CANCER SURVIVORS. MINDFUL EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS YOGA IMPROVE CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE; HOWEVER, STUDIES OF YOGA HAVE INCLUDED HETEROGENEOUS SURVIVORSHIP POPULATIONS, AND THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON FATIGUED SURVIVORS REMAINS UNCLEAR. METHODS: WE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED 34 EARLY-STAGE BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WITH CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (>/=4 ON A LIKERT SCALE FROM 1-10) WITHIN 1 YEAR FROM DIAGNOSIS TO A 12-WEEK INTERVENTION OF HOME-BASED YOGA VERSUS STRENGTHENING EXERCISES, BOTH PRESENTED ON A DVD. THE PRIMARY ENDPOINTS WERE FEASIBILITY AND CHANGES IN FATIGUE, AS MEASURED BY THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL FATIGUE SYMPTOM INVENTORY-SHORT FORM (MFSI-SF). SECONDARY ENDPOINT WAS QUALITY OF LIFE, ASSESSED BY THE FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CANCER THERAPIES-BREAST (FACT-B). RESULTS: WE INVITED 401 WOMEN TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY; 78 RESPONDED, AND WE ENROLLED 34. BOTH GROUPS HAD SIGNIFICANT WITHIN-GROUP IMPROVEMENT IN MULTIPLE DOMAINS OF THE FATIGUE AND QUALITY OF LIFE SCORES FROM BASELINE TO POST-INTERVENTION, AND THESE BENEFITS WERE MAINTAINED AT 3 MONTHS POST-INTERVENTION. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS IN FATIGUE OR QUALITY OF LIFE AT ANY ASSESSMENT TIME. SIMILARLY, THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS IN ADHERENCE TO THE EXERCISE INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: BOTH DVD-BASED YOGA AND STRENGTHENING EXERCISES DESIGNED FOR CANCER SURVIVORS MAY BE GOOD OPTIONS TO ADDRESS FATIGUE IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. BOTH HAVE REASONABLE UPTAKE, ARE CONVENIENT AND REPRODUCIBLE, AND MAY BE HELPFUL IN DECREASING FATIGUE AND IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE FIRST YEAR POST-DIAGNOSIS IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WITH CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
14 1233  45 FEASIBILITY AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF TAILORED YOGA IN SURVIVORS OF HEAD AND NECK CANCER: A PILOT STUDY. PURPOSE: TREATMENT FOR HEAD AND NECK CANCER (HNC) RESULTS IN LONG-TERM TOXICITIES AND INCREASED PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL SURVIVOR BURDEN. THERE ARE A LIMITED NUMBER OF TREATMENTS FOR THESE LATE EFFECTS. YOGA POSTURES, BREATH WORK, RELAXATION, AND MEDITATION, MAY IMPROVE THESE LATE EFFECTS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF A TAILORED YOGA PROGRAM IN HNC SURVIVORS AND OBTAIN PRELIMINARY EFFICACY DATA. METHODS: THIS WAS A RANDOMIZED WAIT-LIST CONTROL STUDY OF YOGA-NAIVE HNC SURVIVORS WHO WERE >3 MONTHS POST-CANCER TREATMENT. BASELINE DATA WERE COLLECTED. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER AN 8-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP OR A WAIT-LIST GROUP. FEASIBILITY AND EFFICACY DATA WERE COLLECTED. AT 4 AND 8 WEEKS, PATIENTS UNDERWENT A REPEAT ASSESSMENT OF HEALTH. WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP PARTICIPANTS WERE OFFERED THE YOGA PROGRAM AFTER DATA COLLECTION. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS EVALUATED FEASIBILITY. MIXED EFFECTS GENERAL LINEAR MODELS WERE USED TO GENERATE ESTIMATES OF THE EFFICACY OUTCOMES. RESULTS: SEVENTY-THREE INDIVIDUALS WERE SCREENED AND 40 WERE ELIGIBLE. ALL ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS CONSENTED AND ENROLLED. FIVE OF THE INTERVENTION GROUP DISCONTINUED EARLY AND NONE IN THE WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP. FEASIBILITY WAS AFFIRMED AS PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED AND RETAINED IN THE STUDY, THERE WERE NO ADVERSE EVENTS, FIDELITY TO PROTOCOL WAS DEMONSTRATED, AND SATISFACTION RATES WERE HIGH. EFFICACY MEASURES INDICATED POTENTIAL BENEFIT FOR SHOULDER RANGE OF MOTION ( D = 0.57-0.86, P < .05), PAIN ( D = 0.67-0.90, P </= .005), AND ANXIETY ( D = 0.59, P = .015). CONCLUSION: A TAILORED HATHA YOGA PROGRAM IS FEASIBLE AND POTENTIALLY EFFICACIOUS FOR HNC SURVIVORS. PRELIMINARY DATA SUPPORTS FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF YOGA IN THIS POPULATION IS NEEDED.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
15 2529  46 YOGA EFFECTIVELY REDUCES FATIGUE AND SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION IN PATIENTS WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF CANCER. PURPOSE: EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF AN 8-WEEK YOGA THERAPY ON FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF CANCER. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 173 CANCER PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM MILD TO SEVERE FATIGUE WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO YOGA INTERVENTION (N = 84) (IG) VERSUS WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (CG) (N = 88). YOGA THERAPY CONSISTED OF EIGHT WEEKLY SESSIONS WITH 60 MIN EACH. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS SELF-REPORTED FATIGUE SYMPTOMS. SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). DATA WERE ASSESSED USING QUESTIONNAIRES BEFORE (T0) AND AFTER YOGA THERAPY FOR IG VERSUS WAITING PERIOD FOR CG (T1). RESULTS: A STRONGER REDUCTION OF GENERAL FATIGUE (P = .033), PHYSICAL FATIGUE (P = .048), AND DEPRESSION (P < .001) AS WELL AS A STRONGER INCREASE IN QOL (P = .002) WAS FOUND FOR PATIENTS WHO ATTENDED 7 OR 8 SESSIONS COMPARED WITH CONTROLS. WITHIN THE YOGA GROUP, BOTH HIGHER ATTENDANCE RATE AND LOWER T0-FATIGUE WERE SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS OF LOWER T1-FATIGUE (P </= .001). EXPLORATORY RESULTS REVEALED THAT WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER REPORT A HIGHER REDUCTION OF FATIGUE THAN WOMEN WITH OTHER TYPES OF CANCER (P = .016) AFTER YOGA THERAPY. CONCLUSION: THE FINDINGS SUPPORT THE ASSUMPTION THAT YOGA THERAPY IS USEFUL TO REDUCE CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, ESPECIALLY FOR THE PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF FATIGUE. WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER SEEM TO BENEFIT MOST, AND HIGHER ATTENDANCE RATE RESULTS IN GREATER REDUCTION OF FATIGUE.

16 1564  50 LONGITUDINAL IMPACT OF YOGA ON CHEMOTHERAPY-RELATED COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN WOMEN WITH EARLY STAGE BREAST CANCER: A CASE SERIES. PURPOSE: ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER HAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED THE CURE RATE; HOWEVER, IT HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH CHEMOTHERAPY-RELATED COGNITIVE IMPACT (CRCI). THE LITERATURE PROVIDES PRELIMINARY SUPPORT FOR THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFICACY OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR THE GENERAL CANCER POPULATION, HOWEVER, CONTROLLED TRIALS ARE SCARCE AND NO STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON COGNITION FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER DURING CHEMOTHERAPY. THIS CASE SERIES AIMS TO IDENTIFY THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON MEASURES OF COGNITION, FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES, AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) FOR BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS (BCS). METHODS: FOUR WOMEN WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF EARLY-STAGE BREAST CANCER PRIOR TO CHEMOTHERAPY TREATMENT WERE ADMINISTERED THE FOLLOWING PHYSIOLOGIC MEASURES AT BASELINE, 6, AND 12 WEEKS DURING CHEMOTHERAPY, AND AT ONE AND THREE MONTHS AFTER THE CONCLUSION OF THE STUDY: FUNCTIONAL REACH TEST (BALANCE) AND SIT AND REACH TEST (FLEXIBILITY), AND QOL, POMS (MOOD) AND FACT-B (QOL), AT BASELINE. PRIMARY OUTCOMES OF COGNITION WERE MEASURED WITH THE PERCEIVED COGNITION QUESTIONNAIRE (PCQ) AND COGSTATE, A COMPUTERIZED MEASUREMENT OF COGNITION. WOMEN ATTENDED AN IYENGAR-INSPIRED YOGA PROGRAM TWICE A WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS. QUALITATIVE QUESTIONNAIRES WERE ADMINISTERED AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE STUDY TO DETERMINE PERCEIVED BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES OF THE YOGA PROGRAM. RESULTS: FOUR WOMEN WITH STAGE II BREAST CANCER RANGED IN AGE FROM 44-65 YEARS. COGSTATE COMPUTERIZED TESTING SHOWED CHANGES IN VARYING DOMAINS OF COGNITION THROUGH TREATMENT AND FOLLOW-UP. IMPROVED BALANCE, FLEXIBILITY, AND QOL WERE ALSO NOTED OVER TIME. NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE OBSERVED. ANALYSIS OF QUALITATIVE DATA REVEALED THE YOGA CLASSES WERE HELPFUL AND SUBJECTS CONTINUED THE PRACTICE ELEMENTS OF YOGA INCLUDING RELAXATION, BREATHING, AND STRETCHING. THE MOST CHALLENGING ASPECT OF THE STUDY WAS PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS DUE TO VARIOUS MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS AND INCLUDED FATIGUE, DECREASED RANGE OF MOTION, AND PAIN. CONCLUSION: THIS CASE SERIES SUGGESTS THAT YOGA MAY IMPACT VARIOUS ASPECTS OF COGNITION DURING AND AFTER CHEMOTHERAPY ADMINISTRATION AS NOTED THROUGH QUANTITATIVE MEASURES. WOMEN DESCRIBE YOGA AS IMPROVING VARIOUS DOMAINS OF QOL THROUGH THE TREATMENT TRAJECTORY. THIS MIND-BODY INTERVENTION MAY STAVE OFF CRCI; HOWEVER, FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS NEEDED FOR ADDITIONAL RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON COGNITION FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER UNDERGOING ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY TREATMENT.	2012	

17 1240  51 FEASIBILITY OF A MINDFUL YOGA PROGRAM FOR WOMEN WITH METASTATIC BREAST CANCER: RESULTS OF A RANDOMIZED PILOT STUDY. PURPOSE: PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC BREAST CANCER (MBC) EXPERIENCE HIGH LEVELS OF SYMPTOMS. YOGA INTERVENTIONS HAVE SHOWN PROMISE FOR IMPROVING CANCER SYMPTOMS BUT HAVE RARELY BEEN TESTED IN PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED DISEASE. THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE ACCEPTABILITY OF A COMPREHENSIVE YOGA PROGRAM FOR MBC AND THE FEASIBILITY OF CONDUCTING A RANDOMIZED TRIAL TESTING THE INTERVENTION. METHODS: SIXTY-THREE WOMEN WITH MBC WERE RANDOMIZED WITH A 2:1 ALLOCATION TO YOGA OR A SUPPORT GROUP COMPARISON CONDITION. BOTH INTERVENTIONS INVOLVED EIGHT WEEKLY GROUP SESSIONS. FEASIBILITY WAS QUANTIFIED USING RATES OF ACCRUAL, ATTRITION, AND SESSION ATTENDANCE. ACCEPTABILITY WAS ASSESSED WITH A STANDARDIZED SELF-REPORT MEASURE. PAIN, FATIGUE, SLEEP QUALITY, PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, MINDFULNESS, AND FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE, POST-INTERVENTION, AND 3 AND 6 MONTHS POST-INTERVENTION. RESULTS: WE MET GOALS FOR ACCRUAL AND RETENTION, WITH 50% OF ELIGIBLE PATIENTS ENROLLED AND 87% OF RANDOMIZED PARTICIPANTS COMPLETING POST-INTERVENTION SURVEYS. SIXTY-FIVE PERCENT OF WOMEN IN THE YOGA CONDITION AND 90% IN THE SUPPORT GROUP ATTENDED >/= 4 SESSIONS. EIGHTY PERCENT OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA CONDITION AND 65% IN THE SUPPORT GROUP INDICATED THAT THEY WERE HIGHLY SATISFIED WITH THE INTERVENTION. FOLLOWING TREATMENT, WOMEN IN THE YOGA INTERVENTION HAD MODEST IMPROVEMENTS IN SOME OUTCOMES; HOWEVER, OVERALL SYMPTOM LEVELS WERE LOW FOR WOMEN IN BOTH CONDITIONS. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE YOGA INTERVENTION CONTENT WAS HIGHLY ACCEPTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH MBC, BUT THAT THERE ARE CHALLENGES TO IMPLEMENTING AN INTERVENTION INVOLVING EIGHT GROUP-BASED IN-PERSON SESSIONS. ALTERNATIVE MODES OF DELIVERY MAY BE NECESSARY TO REACH PATIENTS MOST IN NEED OF INTERVENTION.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
18 2811  38 YOGA TO PREVENT MOBILITY LIMITATIONS IN OLDER ADULTS: FEASIBILITY OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: THE LOSS OF MOBILITY DURING AGING IMPACTS INDEPENDENCE AND LEADS TO FURTHER DISABILITY, MORBIDITY, AND REDUCED LIFE EXPECTANCY. OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND SAFETY OF CONDUCTING A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA FOR OLDER ADULTS AT RISK FOR MOBILITY LIMITATIONS. METHODS: SEDENTARY OLDER ADULTS (N = 46; AGE 60-89) WERE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED TO EITHER YOGA OR A HEALTH EDUCATION COMPARISON GROUP. YOGA SESSIONS (60-MIN) OCCURRED 2X WEEKLY, AND 90-MIN HEALTH EDUCATION SESSIONS OCCURRED WEEKLY, FOR 10 WEEKS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE RECRUITMENT RATE, INTERVENTION ATTENDANCE, AND RETENTION AT ASSESSMENTS. ADVERSE EVENT RATES AND PARTICIPANT SATISFACTION WERE ALSO MEASURED. PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES OF GAIT, BALANCE, AND STRENGTH AND SELF-REPORT OUTCOME MEASURES WERE ADMINISTERED AT BASELINE AND 10-WEEKS. RESULTS: RECRUITMENT LASTED 6 MONTHS. RETENTION OF PARTICIPANTS AT THE 10-WEEK FOLLOW-UP WAS HIGH (89% - PERFORMANCE MEASURES; 98% - SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES). ATTENDANCE WAS GOOD WITH 82% OF YOGA AND 74% OF HEALTH EDUCATION PARTICIPANTS ATTENDING AT LEAST 50% OF THE SESSIONS. NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. PATIENT SATISFACTION WITH THE INTERVENTIONS WAS HIGH. THE MEAN EFFECT SIZE FOR THE PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES WAS 0.35 WITH SOME OVER 0.50. THE MEAN EFFECT SIZE FOR SELF-REPORT OUTCOME MEASURES WAS 0.36. CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS INDICATE THAT IT IS FEASIBLE TO CONDUCT A LARGER RCT OF YOGA FOR SEDENTARY OLDER ADULTS AT RISK FOR MOBILITY PROBLEMS. THE YOGA AND COMPARISON INTERVENTIONS WERE SAFE, WELL ACCEPTED, AND WELL ATTENDED. EFFECT SIZES SUGGEST YOGA MAY HAVE IMPORTANT BENEFITS FOR THIS POPULATION AND SHOULD BE STUDIED FURTHER.

19 2230  51 THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON FATIGUE IN CANCER SURVIVORSHIP: A META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: MIND-BODY APPROACHES, PARTICULARLY YOGA, ARE USED BY CANCER SURVIVORS TO COPE WITH TREATMENT-RELATED SYMPTOMS. CONSISTENCY OF YOGA-RELATED EFFECTS ON TREATMENT-RELATED SYMPTOMS ARE NOT KNOWN. THIS META-ANALYSIS WAS DESIGNED TO EXAMINE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PRE- TO POSTINTERVENTION IMPROVEMENTS IN FATIGUE AMONG CANCER PATIENTS. METHODS: PUBMED AND PSYCINFO WERE SEARCHED FOR PEER-REVIEWED ARTICLES OF YOGA RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS INCLUDING CANCER SURVIVORS AND REPORTING AT LEAST ONE FATIGUE MEASURE. TWENTY-NINE STUDIES MET INCLUSION CRITERIA (N = 1828 PATIENTS). EFFECT SIZES (HEDGE'S G) WERE CALCULATED FOR FATIGUE, DEPRESSION, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. PATIENT-RELATED AND INTERVENTION-RELATED CHARACTERISTICS WERE TESTED AS MODERATORS OF OUTCOMES. ALL STATISTICAL TESTS WERE TWO-SIDED. RESULTS: YOGA PRACTICE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A SMALL, STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN FATIGUE (G = 0.45, P = .013). YOGA TYPE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT MODERATOR OF THIS RELATIONSHIP (P = .02). YOGA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A MODERATE DECREASE IN DEPRESSION (G = 0.72, P = .007) BUT WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN QUALITY OF LIFE (P = .48). SESSION LENGTH WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT MODERATOR OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOGA AND DEPRESSION (P = .004). NEITHER TIMING OF TREATMENT (DURING TREATMENT VS POSTTREATMENT) NOR CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT MODERATORS OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON OUTCOMES. THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON FATIGUE AND DEPRESSION WAS LARGER WHEN THE COMPARATOR WAS A "WAITLIST" OR "USUAL CARE" THAN WHEN THE CONTROL GROUP WAS ANOTHER ACTIVE TREATMENT (P = .036). CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS SUGGEST YOGA MAY BE BENEFICIAL AS A COMPONENT OF TREATMENT FOR BOTH FATIGUE AND DEPRESSION IN CANCER SURVIVORS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
20 2644  39 YOGA FOR WOMEN WITH URGENCY URINARY INCONTINENCE: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVES: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF A GENTLE YOGA PROGRAM FOR WOMEN WITH URGENCY URINARY INCONTINENCE (UUI). ALSO, THESE PRELIMINARY DATA CAN EVALUATE IF YOGA IMPROVES SYMPTOM BURDEN, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS FOR WOMEN WITH UUI. METHODS: THIS PROSPECTIVE NONRANDOMIZED SINGLE-ARM PILOT STUDY EVALUATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A TWICE-WEEKLY, 8-WEEK GENTLE YOGA INTERVENTION TO REDUCE UUI SYMPTOM BURDEN. CHANGES IN SYMPTOM BURDEN WERE MEASURED USING THE PELVIC FLOOR DISTRESS INVENTORY 20. SECONDARY MEASURES INCLUDED QUALITY OF LIFE, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, SLEEP, STRESS, ANXIETY, AND INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS. OUTCOMES WERE EVALUATED WITH PAIRED T TESTING. RESULTS: TWELVE WOMEN COMPLETED THE YOGA INTERVENTION WITH NO ADVERSE OUTCOMES NOTED. URGENCY SYMPTOM BURDEN WAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED AFTER THE INTERVENTION (P = 0.01), AND WOMEN REPORTED AN INCREASE IN QUALITY OF LIFE (P = 0.04) AFTER THE YOGA INTERVENTION. FOLLOWING THE YOGA INTERVENTION, THE MAJORITY OF WOMEN REPORTED SYMPTOMS AS "MUCH BETTER" (N = 4 [33%]) AND "A LITTLE BETTER" (N = 5 [42%]), WITH 3 WOMEN (25%) REPORTING "NO CHANGE." WOMEN ALSO REPORTED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (P = 0.03) AND BETTER QUALITY OF SLEEP (P = 0.03). NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE FOUND IN ANXIETY OR STRESS PERCEPTION. PLASMA LEVELS OF THE INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKER TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR ALPHA WERE REDUCED AFTER YOGA INTERVENTION (P = 0.009); HOWEVER, NO SIGNIFICANT POSTYOGA CHANGES WERE FOUND FOR INTERLEUKIN 6 OR C-REACTIVE PROTEIN. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY PROVIDES PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE THAT YOGA IS A FEASIBLE COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY THAT REDUCES INCONTINENCE SYMPTOM BURDEN, ALONG WITH IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, AND SLEEP QUALITY. ADDITIONALLY, YOGA MAY LOWER INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS ASSOCIATED WITH INCONTINENCE.	2021

1  732 150 EFFECT OF MINDFULNESS YOGA PROGRAMME MIYOGA ON ATTENTION, BEHAVIOUR, AND PHYSICAL OUTCOMES IN CEREBRAL PALSY: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. AIM: TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFICACY OF AN EMBODIED MINDFULNESS-BASED MOVEMENT PROGRAMME (MIYOGA), TARGETING ATTENTION IN CHILDREN WITH CEREBRAL PALSY (CP). METHOD: TOTAL NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS 42, WITH 24 BOYS (57.1%) AND 18 GIRLS (42.9%); MEAN AGE 9Y 1MO, SD 3Y; GROSS MOTOR FUNCTION CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM LEVELS I=22, II=12, III=8) AND THEIR PARENTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER MIYOGA (N=21) OR WAITLIST COMPARISON (N=21) GROUPS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS ATTENTION POSTINTERVENTION MEASURED BY THE CONNERS' CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE TEST, SECOND EDITION (CCPT). SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED PARENT AND CHILD MINDFULNESS, CHILD QUALITY OF LIFE, PARENTAL WELL-BEING, CHILD EXECUTIVE FUNCTION, CHILD BEHAVIOUR, CHILD PHYSICAL MEASURES, AND THE PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIP. RESULTS: CHILDREN IN THE MIYOGA GROUP DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER ATTENTION POSTINTERVENTION THAN THE WAITLIST COMPARISON GROUP, WITH LOWER INATTENTION SCORES ON THE HIT REACTION TIME STANDARD ERROR (F1,33 =4.59, P=0.04, PARTIAL ETA-SQUARED [ETAP2]=0.13) VARIABLE AND FEWER PERSEVERATION ERRORS (F1,33 =4.60, P=0.04, ETAP2=0.13) ON THE CCPT. INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS ALSO REVEALED THAT SUSTAINED ATTENTION IN THE MIYOGA GROUP WAS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN IN THE WAITLIST COMPARISON GROUP POSTINTERVENTION (F1,37 =5.97, P=0.02, ETAP2=0.14). PARENTS IN THE MIYOGA GROUP DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED MINDFULNESS (MINDFULNESS ATTENTION AWARENESS SCALE; F1,33 =10.130, P=0.003, ETAP2=0.246). INTERPRETATION: MIYOGA OFFERS A LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION THAT IMPROVES ATTENTION IN CHILDREN WITH CP. MIYOGA CAN BE CONSIDERED AS AN ADDITIONAL OPTION TO STANDARD REHABILITATION TO ENHANCE ATTENTION FOR CHILDREN WITH CP. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: MIYOGA, AN EMBODIED MINDFULNESS-BASED MOVEMENT PROGRAMME, CAN ENHANCE ATTENTION (MORE ATTENTIVE AND CONSISTENT PERFORMANCE) IN CHILDREN WITH CEREBRAL PALSY. MIYOGA HAD NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
2 1976  76 SIX-MONTH FOLLOW-UP OF A MINDFULNESS YOGA PROGRAM, MIYOGA, ON ATTENTION, EXECUTIVE FUNCTION, BEHAVIOUR AND PHYSICAL OUTCOMES IN CEREBRAL PALSY. PURPOSE: A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) OF A MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA PROGRAM, MIYOGA, FOR CEREBRAL PALSY (CP) DEMONSTRATED IMPROVED ATTENTION IN CHILDREN AND DECREASED MINDFULNESS IN PARENTS POST-INTERVENTION. THIS PAPER EVALUATES THE RETENTION OF TREATMENT EFFECTS AT 6-MONTHS FOLLOW-UP. METHODS: 42 CHILDREN WITH CP AND THEIR PARENTS PARTICIPATED IN A RCT WITH TWO GROUPS MIYOGA (N = 21) AND WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 21). WAITLIST CONTROL PARTICIPANTS WERE OFFERED MIYOGA FOLLOWING THE POST-INTERVENTION ASSESSMENT. 23 OUT OF 42 CHILD-PARENT DYADS FROM BOTH GROUPS COMPLETED FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENT 6-MONTHS AFTER COMPLETING MIYOGA. THIS PAPER EVALUATES AND REPORTS DATA FROM BOTH GROUPS COLLAPSED (N = 23; MIYOGA N = 11; AND WAITLIST CONTROL N = 12; 47.8% MALE; MEAN AGE = 9:10 +/- 2.4 YEARS) TO ASSESS RETENTION FROM POST-MIYOGA TO FOLLOW-UP AND PRE-MIYOGA TO FOLLOW-UP. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS ATTENTION, MEASURED BY CONNER'S CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE TEST II (CCPT). SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED CHILD EXECUTIVE FUNCTION, PHYSICAL FUNCTION, BEHAVIOUR, QUALITY OF LIFE, CHILD AND PARENT MINDFULNESS, PERSONAL WELLBEING, PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING AND PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIP. RESULTS: PAIRED T-TESTS SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES BETWEEN POST-MIYOGA TO FOLLOW-UP AND PRE-MIYOGA TO FOLLOW-UP FOR VARIABLES THAT SHOWED AN INTERVENTION EFFECT IMMEDIATELY AFTER MIYOGA, NAMELY, CHILDREN'S ATTENTION VARIABLES AND PARENT'S MINDFULNESS. PAIRED T-TESTS SHOWED THAT CHILDREN'S EXECUTIVE FUNCTION AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND PARENT'S WELLBEING IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PRE-MIYOGA TO 6-MONTHS FOLLOW-UP WHICH MAY POTENTIALLY REFLECT SLEEPER OR DELAYED EFFECTS OF MIYOGA. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY IDENTIFIED POSSIBLE DELAYED OR SLEEPER EFFECTS IN CHILDREN'S EXECUTIVE FUNCTION AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND PARENT'S WELL-BEING.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP EVIDENCE FOR RETENTION OF EFFECTS OF MIYOGA ON CHILDREN'S ATTENTION WAS INCONSISTENT; THEREFORE, BOOSTER SESSIONS OR CONTINUED PRACTICE OF MIYOGA AS A LIFESTYLE OPTION ARE NEEDED TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECT ON ATTENTION.BECAUSE MIYOGA CAN BE PRACTISED DURING DAILY ACTIVITIES, IT MAY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR CHILDREN WITH CP, COMPLEMENTING STANDARD REHABILITATION OPTIONS.BY EMBEDDING MINDFULNESS IN CHILDREN AND PARENTS' DAILY ACTIVITIES, MIYOGA, COULD PROVIDE FAMILIES WITH ACCESSIBLE AND TIME-EFFICIENT MEANS OF LEARNING AND PRACTICING MINDFULNESS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
3 1205  33 EXPERIENCES OF CHILDREN AND PARENTS IN MIYOGA, AN EMBODIED MINDFULNESS YOGA PROGRAM FOR CEREBRAL PALSY: A MIXED METHOD STUDY. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: A MINDFULNESS YOGA PROGRAM (MIYOGA) WAS DEVELOPED AND TRIALLED WITH CHILDREN WITH CEREBRAL PALSY AND THEIR PARENTS. THIS MIXED-METHOD STUDY EXPLORES THE EXPERIENCES OF CHILDREN AND PARENTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN MIYOGA, TO ASSESS ITS ACCEPTABILITY, FEASIBILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION. MATERIALS AND METHODS: OF THE FORTY-TWO CHILD-PARENT DYADS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE MIYOGA RANDOMISED CONTROL TRIAL, 19 CHILDREN AND 22 PARENTS WERE INTERVIEWED INDIVIDUALLY IN A SEMI-STRUCTURED WAY ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES OF MIYOGA. PARTICIPANTS RATED THEIR MOOD ON A 5-POINT SCALE BEFORE AND AFTER EACH SESSION AND COMPLETED SHORT QUESTIONNAIRES AT THE END OF EACH SESSION. RESULTS: CHILDREN AND PARENTS REPORTED IMPROVED MOOD AFTER EACH MIYOGA SESSION. PARENTS REPORTED BEING MORE AWARE OF THEIR THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS AND POSSIBLY BECAME MORE AWARE OF THEIR DAY-TO-DAY MINDLESSNESS. CONCLUSION: MIYOGA SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED CHILDREN AND PARENTS' MOOD. PARENTS REPORTED GAINS IN AWARENESS AS WELL AS CHALLENGES OF ADHERING TO THE HOME PRACTICE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
4 2188  42 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON THE ATTENTION AND BEHAVIOR OF BOYS WITH ATTENTION-DEFICIT/ HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (ADHD). BOYS DIAGNOSED WITH ADHD BY SPECIALIST PEDIATRICIANS AND STABILIZED ON MEDICATION WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A 20-SESSION YOGA GROUP (N = 11) OR A CONTROL GROUP (COOPERATIVE ACTIVITIES; N = 8). BOYS WERE ASSESSED PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION ON THE CONNERS' PARENT AND TEACHER RATING SCALES-REVISED: LONG (CPRS-R:L & CTRS-R:L; CONNERS, 1997), THE TEST OF VARIABLES OF ATTENTION (TOVA; GREENBERG, CORMNA, & KINDSCHI, 1997), AND THE MOTION LOGGER ACTIGRAPH. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING ONE-WAY REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA). SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS FROM PRE-TEST TO POST-TEST WERE FOUND FOR THE YOGA, BUT NOT FOR THE CONTROL GROUP ON FIVE SUBSCALES OF THE CONNERS' PARENTS RATING SCALES (CPRS): OPPOSITIONAL, GLOBAL INDEX EMOTIONAL LABILITY, GLOBAL INDEX TOTAL, GLOBAL INDEX RESTLESS/IMPULSIVE AND ADHD INDEX. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS FROM PRE-TEST TO POST-TEST WERE FOUND FOR THE CONTROL GROUP, BUT NOT THE YOGA GROUP ON THREE CPRS SUBSCALES: HYPERACTIVITY, ANXIOUS/SHY, AND SOCIAL PROBLEMS. BOTH GROUPS IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY ON CPRS PERFECTIONISM, DSM-IV HYPERACTIVE/ IMPULSIVE, AND DSM-IV TOTAL. FOR THE YOGA GROUP, POSITIVE CHANGE FROM PRE- TO POST-TEST ON THE CONNERS' TEACHER RATING SCALES (CTRS) WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NUMBER OF SESSIONS ATTENDED ON THE DSM-IV HYPERACTIVE-IMPULSIVE SUBSCALE AND WITH A TREND ON DSM-IV INATTENTIVE SUBSCALE. THOSE IN THE YOGA GROUP WHO ENGAGED IN MORE HOME PRACTICE SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT ON TOVA RESPONSE TIME VARIABILITY WITH A TREND ON THE ADHD SCORE, AND GREATER IMPROVEMENTS ON THE CTRS GLOBAL EMOTIONAL LABILITY SUBSCALE. RESULTS FROM THE MOTION LOGGER ACTIGRAPH WERE INCONCLUSIVE. ALTHOUGH THESE DATA DO NOT PROVIDE STRONG SUPPORT FOR THE USE OF YOGA FOR ADHD, PARTLY BECAUSE THE STUDY WAS UNDER-POWERED, THEY DO SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY HAVE MERIT AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR BOYS WITH ADHD ALREADY STABILIZED ON MEDICATION, PARTICULARLY FOR ITS EVENING EFFECT WHEN MEDICATION EFFECTS ARE ABSENT. YOGA REMAINS AN INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT, BUT THIS STUDY SUPPORTS FURTHER RESEARCH INTO ITS POSSIBLE USES FOR THIS POPULATION. THESE FINDINGS NEED TO BE REPLICATED ON LARGER GROUPS WITH A MORE INTENSIVE SUPERVISED PRACTICE PROGRAM.	2004	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
5  934  29 EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM ON THE SEVERITY OF AUTISM. THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM (YTP) ON THE SEVERITY OF AUTISM IN CHILDREN WITH HIGH FUNCTION AUTISM (HFA). TWENTY-NINE CHILDREN AGED 7 TO 15 (MEAN = 11.22, SD = 2.91) YEARS WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO EITHER YOGA OR CONTROL GROUP. THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP RECEIVED AN 8-WEEK (24-SESSION) YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM (YTP). PARENTS OR CAREGIVERS OF PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED AUTISM TREATMENT EVALUATION CHECKLIST (ATEC) AT BASELINE AND THE END OF THE INTERVENTION. THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS WITH REGARDS TO ALL ATEC SUB-SCORES EXCEPT ATEC I (SPEECH/LANGUAGE/COMMUNICATION). THIS STUDY PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM AND IDENTIFIES SPECIFIC PROCEDURAL ENHANCEMENTS TO REDUCE THE SEVERITY OF SYMPTOMS IN CHILDREN WITH AUTISM.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
6  843  40 EFFECT OF YOGA ON PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONING OF NURSING STUDENTS: A RANDOMIZED WAIT LIST CONTROL TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: NURSING STUDENTS EXPERIENCE CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF STRESS TO MEET THEIR PROFESSIONAL DEMANDS. YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE PRACTICE TO REDUCE STRESS AND IMPROVE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL BEING. HOWEVER, IMPROVEMENT IN PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL BEING AIDS IN STRESS MANAGEMENT. AIM: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EIGHT WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION ON PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONING OF NURSING STUDENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS WAS A RANDOMISED WAIT LIST CONTROL (WLC) TRIAL, WE RECRUITED TOTAL 100 STUDENTS FROM KEMPEGOWDA INSTITUTE OF NURSING, BENGALURU, KARNATAKA, INDIA AND RANDOMIZED THEM INTO TWO GROUPS (YOGA=50 AND WLC=50 STUDENTS). THE FOLLOWING INSTRUMENTS WERE USED TO COLLECT THE DATA, FREIBURG MINDFULNESS INVENTORY (FMI), SELF-COMPASSION SCALE- SHORT FORM (SCS-SF), CONNOR-DAVIDSON RESILIENCE SCALE (CD-RISC), SATISFACTION WITH LIFE SCALE (SWLS), JEFFERSON SCALE OF EMPATHY HPS-VERSION (JSE-HPS), AND PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE (PSS). DATA WAS ANALYSED USING REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (RM-ANOVA) FOLLOWED BY POST-HOC BONFERRONI CORRECTION FOR ALL PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIABLES. RESULTS: THE RESULTS OF OUR STUDY REPORT THAT EIGHT WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING SELF COMPASSION AND MINDFULNESS AMONG NURSING STUDENTS IN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP THAN COMPARED TO WLC GROUP. EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE IMPROVEMENTS IN RESILIENCE, SATISFACTION IN LIFE AND PERCEIVED STRESS, RESULTS WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. CONCLUSION: OVERALL, RESULTS OF THE PRESENT STUDY HAVE DEMONSTRATED IMPACT OF EIGHT WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONING OF NURSING STUDENTS. YOGA INTERVENTION CAN BE INCULCATED IN THE NURSING EDUCATION TO MEET DEMANDS OF THE PROFESSION.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
7 2653  39 YOGA IMPROVES OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE, DEPRESSION, AND DAILY ACTIVITIES FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC PAIN IS A COMPLEX ACCUMULATION OF PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS, THUS INTERVENTIONS THAT ADDRESS PAIN AND PROMOTE OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE ARE NEEDED. A HOLISTIC INTERVENTION, WITH MIND AND BODY COMPONENTS, IS LIKELY NECESSARY TO BEST TREAT THE COMPLEXITIES OF CHRONIC PAIN. THUS, WE DEVELOPED AND TESTED A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN. OBJECTIVES: IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL (RCT), PARTICIPANTS WITH CHRONIC PAIN WERE RANDOMIZED TO A YOGA INTERVENTION OR USUAL CARE GROUP. BETWEEN AND WITHIN GROUP DIFFERENCES FOR PRE-AND POST-OUTCOME MEASURE SCORES WERE ASSESSED FOR: OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE, COMPLETION OF ACTIVITIES, AND DEPRESSION. METHODS: PILOT RCT WITH PARTICIPANT ALLOCATION TO 8 WEEKS OF YOGA OR USUAL CARE. BOTH GROUPS RECEIVED ONGOING MONTHLY SELF-MANAGEMENT PROGRAMMING. DATA WERE COLLECTED BEFORE AND AFTER THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA OR USUAL CARE AFTER BASELINE ASSESSMENTS. DEMOGRAPHICS WERE COLLECTED AND MEASURES INCLUDED: CANADIAN OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE MEASURE (COPM) TO ASSESS OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE; THE 15-ITEM FRENCHAY ACTIVITIES INDEX (FAI)(ACTIVITIES); AND THE 9-ITEM PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE (PHQ-9) FOR DEPRESSION. INDEPENDENT T-TESTS WERE USED TO ASSESS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS. PAIRED T-TESTS WERE USED TO ASSESS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRE- AND POST 8-WEEK INTERVENTION FOR BOTH THE YOGA AND THE USUAL CARE GROUPS. PERCENT CHANGE SCORES AND EFFECT SIZES WERE CALCULATED. RESULTS: 83 PEOPLE WERE RECRUITED FOR THE STUDY AND COMPLETED BASELINE ASSESSMENTS; 44 INDIVIDUALS WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA AND 39 TO THE CONTROL GROUP. THE AVERAGE AGE OF ALL PARTICIPANTS WAS 51.4+/-10.5 YEARS, 68% WERE FEMALE; AND 60% HAD AT LEAST SOME COLLEGE EDUCATION. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN DEMOGRAPHICS OR OUTCOME MEASURES BETWEEN GROUPS AT BASELINE OR 8 WEEKS; HOWEVER, THE STUDY WAS NOT POWERED TO SEE SUCH DIFFERENCES. INDIVIDUALS RANDOMIZED TO THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE IN ANY OUTCOME MEASURE OVER THE 8 WEEKS. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN COPM PERFORMANCE AND COPM SATISFACTION SCORES FOR INDIVIDUALS RANDOMIZED TO THE YOGA GROUP; BOTH SCORES SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED. COPM PERFORMANCE IMPROVED BY 27% WITH A MODERATE TO LARGE EFFECT SIZE (3.66+/-1.85 VS 4.66+/-1.93, P < 0.001, D = 0.76). COPM SATISFACTION SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED BY 78% (2.14+/-2.31 VS. 3.80+/-2.50, P < 0.001) AND HAD A LARGE EFFECTS SIZE (D = 1.02). FAI SCORES IMPROVED, INDICATING INCREASED ACTIVITY OR ENGAGEMENT IN DAILY OCCUPATION DURING THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION. SCORES INCREASED BY 5% (38.13+/-8.48 VS. 39.90+/-8.57, P = 0.024) WITH A SMALL EFFECT SIZE (D = 0.37). DEPRESSION SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED FROM 13.21+/-5.60 TO 11.41+/-5.82, P = 0.041, WITH A SMALL EFFECT SIZE. CONCLUSION: DATA FROM THIS PILOT RCT INDICATE YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION WITH PEOPLE IN CHRONIC PAIN TO IMPROVE OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE, INCREASE ENGAGEMENT IN ACTIVITIES, AND DECREASE DEPRESSION. OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY PRACTITIONERS MAY CONSIDER ADDING YOGA AS A TREATMENT INTERVENTION TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH PAIN.	2019	

8  579  26 DESIGNING A YOGA INTERVENTION PROGRAM TO IMPROVE WELL-BEING FOR PHYSICIAN TRAINEES: CHALLENGES AND LESSONS LEARNED. WELL-BEING ACTIVITIES MAY HELP TO COUNTERACT PHYSICIAN BURNOUT. YOGA IS KNOWN TO ENHANCE WELL-BEING, BUT THERE ARE FEW STUDIES OF YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR PHYSICIANS IN TRAINING. THIS PROSPECTIVE METHODOLOGY-DEVELOPMENT STUDY AIMED TO EXPLORE HOW TO ESTABLISH A YOGA-BASED WELL-BEING INTERVENTION FOR PHYSICIAN TRAINEES IN A LARGE URBAN TRAINING HOSPITAL. WE AIMED TO IDENTIFY FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO TRAINEE PARTICIPATION AND EXPLORE AN INSTRUMENT TO MEASURE CHANGES IN SELF-REPORTED WELL-BEING AFTER YOGA. COHORTS INCLUDED A REQUIRED-ATTENDANCE GROUP, A VOLUNTARY-ATTENDANCE GROUP, AND AN UNASSIGNED WALK-IN YOGA GROUP. WEEKLY 1-HOUR YOGA SESSIONS WERE LED BY A QUALIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTOR FOR 4 WEEKS. THE SEVEN-QUESTION RESIDENT PHYSICIAN WELL-BEING INDEX (RPWBI) WAS USED TO MEASURE RESIDENT WELL-BEING BEFORE YOGA, AFTER 4 WEEKS OF YOGA, AND 6 MONTHS POST-YOGA. TRAINEES ATTENDING EACH SESSION RANGED FROM 17 FOR REQUIRED YOGA TO 0-2 FOR VOLUNTARY YOGA, 2-9 FOR LUNCHTIME WALK-IN YOGA, AND 1-7 FOR EVENING WALK-IN YOGA. IN THE REQUIRED-YOGA GROUP (N = 17), OVERALL RPWBI MEAN SCORES DID NOT CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY ACROSS THE THREE QUERY TIMES, AND PARTICIPATION IN THE SURVEY DECLINED OVER TIME. THE MEAN BASELINE RPWBI SCORE FOR THE REQUIRED GROUP BEFORE YOGA WAS IN THE NON-DISTRESSED RANGE AND ANSWERS TO THE SEVEN INDIVIDUAL QUESTIONS VARIED. REQUIRING A YOGA ACTIVITY FOR MEDICAL TRAINEES MAY BE A GOOD STRATEGY FOR PROMOTING PARTICIPATION IN YOGA. THE RPWBI MAY HAVE LIMITED UTILITY FOR MEASURING CHANGES IN OVERALL GROUP WELL-BEING AFTER A YOGA INTERVENTION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
9 1412  37 IMPLEMENTATION OF A NON-RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION TO REDUCE BEHAVIOURAL ISSUES IN EARLY ADOLESCENT SCHOOL-GOING CHILDREN IN SRI LANKA. BACKGROUND: ADOLESCENCE CAN BE DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE AND THE POST-CONFLICT ENVIRONMENT IN JAFFNA PROVINCE, SRI LANKA COMPOUNDS EXISTING ISSUES FOR ADOLESCENTS. CONDUCT PROBLEMS, HYPERACTIVITY ALONG WITH EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS ARE CHALLENGES FACED BY ADOLESCENTS, PARTICULARLY IN FRAGILE, POST-CONFLICT SETTINGS. THIS STUDY WAS A NON-RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL CARRIED OUT IN 4 EDUCATIONAL ZONES OVER 6 MONTHS. THE STUDY IMPLEMENTED A YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION PACKAGE: TWO TYPES OF SLOW BREATHING FOR 5-6 MIN, SURYA-NAMASKARAM FOR 6-8 MIN, AND MINDFULNESS MEDITATION FOR 5-6 MIN. PRE/POST QUANTITATIVE ASSESSMENTS WERE CONDUCTED WITH INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS. A FOCUS GROUP WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE INTERVENTION GROUP. THE AIM WAS TO EVALUATE. EFFECTIVENESS OF IMPLEMENTING A YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION PACKAGE IN GRADE 8 SCHOOL CHILDREN (EARLY ADOLESCENTS) TO ADDRESS BEHAVIOURAL PROBLEMS. RESULTS: PAIRED T-TEST AND INDEPENDENT T-TESTS WERE COMPLETED FOR BOTH ARMS USING STATISTICAL PRODUCT AND SERVICE SOLUTIONS (SPSS21). PARENTS' ASSESSMENTS OF EMOTIONAL ISSUES REDUCED FOR THE INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 584) [T(584) = 11.41, P = 0.001] ALONG WITH REDUCTION OF THE TOTAL DIFFICULTY SCORE [T(584) = 28.12, P = 0.001]. TEACHERS' ASSESSMENTS INDICATED PROSOCIAL SCORES IMPROVED IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP [T(584) = - 28.5, P = 0.001]. STUDENTS' SELF-ASSESSMENTS IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP INDICATE A REDUCTION IN EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS [T(584) = 6.4, P = 0.001], AND REDUCTION IN PROBLEMS WITH PEERS [T(584) = 14.4, P = 0.001]. WITHIN THE CONTROL GROUP (N = 499), TEACHERS' ASSESSMENTS INDICATED EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS INCREASED [T(499) = - 9.5, P = 0.001] AND PROSOCIAL SCORES REDUCED [T(499) = 13.5, P = 0.001]. STUDENTS' SELF-ASSESSMENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP INDICATED EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS INCREASED [T(499) = - 27.1, P = 0.001]. A COMPARISON OF POST-TEST SCORES REVEALED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS. FOCUS GROUP RESULTS INDICATE STUDENTS FELT THE INTERVENTION HAD AN OVERALL POSITIVE EFFECT ON SCHOOL ACHIEVEMENTS, FAMILY DYNAMICS AND INDIVIDUAL HEALTH. CONCLUSIONS: THIS YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION PACKAGE APPEARED TO BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING BOTH EXTERNALIZING AND INTERNALIZING SYMPTOMS IN ADOLESCENTS. PRACTICING SURYA-NAMASKARAM, BREATHING CONTROL TECHNIQUES AND MINDFULNESS MEDITATION SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BOTH EXTERNALIZING SYMPTOMS (CONDUCT PROBLEMS AND HYPERACTIVITY) AS WELL AS INTERNALIZING SYMPTOM (EMOTIONAL PROBLEM AND PEER PROBLEMS). IT IS RECOMMENDED THIS INTERVENTION BE SCALED UP ACROSS SRI LANKA AND OTHER SIMILAR POST-CONFLICT REGIONS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
10 2115  29 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH HAEMOPHILIA. THE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY HAEMOPHILIA LEAD TO IMPAIRMENTS OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH HAEMOPHILIA. THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH HAEMOPHILIA IN SHIRAZ, IRAN. THIS SEMI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WITH PRE- AND POST-TEST DESIGN WAS PERFORMED ON 27 BOYS BETWEEN 8 AND 16 YEARS OLD WHO SUFFERED FROM HAEMOPHILIA. THE PATIENTS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS. THE NUMBER OF BLEEDINGS, ABSENCES FROM SCHOOL, AND REFERRALS TO THE CLINIC WAS EVALUATED. THE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH INTERVIEWS AND USING THE PATIENTS' RECORDS IN THE HAEMOPHILIA CENTER. BESIDES, THE QUALITY OF LIFE WAS ASSESSED THROUGH THE HAEMO-QOL QUESTIONNAIRE. THEN, THE YOGA INTERVENTION WAS PERFORMED FOR 14 WEEKS AND THE DATA WERE COLLECTED IN THREE STAGES. THE COLLECTED DATA WERE ENTERED INTO THE SPSS STATISTICAL SOFTWARE, VERSION 18 AND WERE ANALYZED USING NON-PARAMETRIC FRIEDMAN TEST. AFTER THE INTERVENTION, SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED IN THE MEAN SCORES OF QUALITY OF LIFE DIMENSIONS AND THE NUMBER OF BLEEDINGS, SCHOOL ABSENCES, AND REFERRALS TO THE HAEMOPHILIA CLINIC (P<0.001). THUS, YOGA MAY IMPROVE THE HAEMOPHILIA CHILDREN'S AND ADOLESCENTS' PERCEPTION OF QUALITY OF LIFE WITHOUT THE RISK OF INJURY. THIS INTERVENTION ALSO SEEMED TO BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE NUMBER OF BLEEDINGS, REFERRALS TO THE HAEMOPHILIA CLINIC, AND ABSENCES FROM SCHOOL.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
11 2890  32 YOGA: POTENTIAL BENEFITS FOR PERSONS WHO STUTTER. YOGA HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO MODULATE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM ACTIVITY, DECREASING ANXIETY AND STRESS, AND IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE. THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY SOUGHT TO EXAMINE THE USE OF YOGIC TECHNIQUES ON PERSONS WHO STUTTER GIVEN THE INTERACTION BETWEEN PHYSIOLOGICAL AROUSAL/ANXIETY AND STUTTERING THAT CURRENT MULTIFACTORIAL MODELS OF STUTTERING PROPOSE. FOUR PARTICIPANTS (M = 52 YR, SD = 10; 2 FEMALE, 2 MALE), RECRUITED FROM LOCAL STUTTERING SUPPORT GROUPS IN THE GREATER PHILADELPHIA COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERED TO PARTICIPATE. STUTTERING SEVERITY, ANXIETY, AND EXPERIENCES REGARDING STUTTERING AND COMMUNICATION WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE, POST INTERVENTION, AND AT 4 MONTHS FOLLOW-UP. THE PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED GROUP YOGA SESSIONS AND ENGAGED IN HOME PRACTICE. DESCRIPTIVE RESULTS REVEALED THAT PARTICIPANTS SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS ACROSS OUTCOME MEASURES, WITH THE MOST IMPROVEMENT RELATED TO ANXIETY. PARTICIPANTS ALSO REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR PERCEPTIONS ABOUT COMMUNICATION AS PER QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF RESPONSES TO THE OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONNAIRES. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR PERSONS WHO STUTTER AND WARRANTS FURTHER STUDY USING AN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
12 1629  25 MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA FOR YOUTH WITH PERSISTENT CONCUSSION: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: WE EXPLORED THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA (MBY) FOR YOUTH WITH PERSISTENT CONCUSSION BY EXAMINING OCCUPATION-BASED AND NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL OUTCOMES. METHOD: IN THIS CASE SERIES DESIGN STUDY, 6 YOUTHS AGES 13-17 YR WITH CONCUSSION SYMPTOMS FOR >4 WK PARTICIPATED IN AN 8-WK MBY INTERVENTION, 1X/WK FOR 45 MIN. PARTICIPATION, SELF-EFFICACY, AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY (24 HR) WERE COLLECTED BEFORE, AFTER, AND 3 MO AFTER THE INTERVENTION. HEART RATE VARIABILITY WAS ALSO MEASURED DURING EACH SESSION. RESULTS: TRENDS OF INCREASED SELF-EFFICACY IN ACADEMIC, SOCIAL, AND EMOTIONAL DOMAINS WERE FOUND AFTER MBY AND MAINTAINED AT 3-MO FOLLOW-UP. TRENDS OF INCREASING HEART RATE VARIABILITY WERE ALSO FOUND PRE- TO POSTINTERVENTION AND WITHIN THE EIGHT MBY SESSIONS. CONCLUSION: PRELIMINARY RESULTS REVEAL POSITIVE TRENDS AFTER A NOVEL, SAFE INTERVENTION FOR YOUTH WITH PERSISTENT CONCUSSION SYMPTOMS AND THE VALUE OF EXPLORING BOTH OCCUPATION-BASED AND NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES. FUTURE RESEARCH WITH A LARGER SAMPLE AND CONTROL GROUP IS WARRANTED.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
13   51  28 A COMPARATIVE RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF THE EFFECTS OF BRAIN WAVE VIBRATION TRAINING, IYENGAR YOGA, AND MINDFULNESS ON MOOD, WELL-BEING, AND SALIVARY CORTISOL. THIS RANDOMISED TRIAL COMPARED THE EFFECTS OF BRAIN WAVE VIBRATION (BWV) TRAINING, WHICH INVOLVES RHYTHMIC YOGA-LIKE MEDITATIVE EXERCISES, WITH IYENGAR YOGA AND MINDFULNESS. IYENGAR PROVIDED A CONTRAST FOR THE PHYSICAL COMPONENTS AND MINDFULNESS FOR THE "MENTAL" COMPONENTS OF BWV. 35 HEALTHY ADULTS COMPLETED 10 75-MINUTE CLASSES OF BWV, IYENGAR, OR MINDFULNESS OVER FIVE WEEKS. PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSESSED AT PRE- AND POSTINTERVENTION FOR MOOD, SLEEP, MINDFULNESS, ABSORPTION, HEALTH, MEMORY, AND SALIVARY CORTISOL. BETTER OVERALL MOOD AND VITALITY FOLLOWED BOTH BWV AND IYENGAR TRAINING, WHILE THE BWV GROUP ALONE HAD IMPROVED DEPRESSION AND SLEEP LATENCY. MINDFULNESS PRODUCED A COMPARATIVELY GREATER INCREASE IN ABSORPTION. ALL INTERVENTIONS IMPROVED STRESS AND MINDFULNESS, WHILE NO CHANGES OCCURRED IN HEALTH, MEMORY, OR SALIVARY CORTISOL. IN CONCLUSION, INCREASED WELL-BEING FOLLOWED TRAINING IN ALL THREE PRACTICES, INCREASED ABSORPTION WAS SPECIFIC TO MINDFULNESS, WHILE BWV WAS UNIQUE IN ITS BENEFITS TO DEPRESSION AND SLEEP LATENCY, WARRANTING FURTHER RESEARCH.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
14   97  27 A NONRANDOMIZED COMPARISON STUDY OF SELF-HYPNOSIS, YOGA, AND COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY TO REDUCE EMOTIONAL DISTRESS IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. THE AUTHORS ASKED BREAST CANCER (BC) PATIENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN 1 OF 3 MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS (COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT), YOGA, OR SELF-HYPNOSIS) TO EXPLORE THEIR FEASIBILITY, EASE OF COMPLIANCE, AND IMPACT ON THE PARTICIPANTS' DISTRESS, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), SLEEP, AND MENTAL ADJUSTMENT. NINETY-NINE PATIENTS COMPLETED AN INTERVENTION (CBT: N = 10; YOGA: N = 21; AND SELF-HYPNOSIS: N = 68). RESULTS SHOWED HIGH FEASIBILITY AND HIGH COMPLIANCE. AFTER THE INTERVENTIONS, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT IN THE CBT GROUP BUT SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECTS ON DISTRESS IN THE YOGA AND SELF-HYPNOSIS GROUPS, AND, ALSO, ON QOL, SLEEP, AND MENTAL ADJUSTMENT IN THE SELF-HYPNOSIS GROUP. IN CONCLUSION, MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS CAN DECREASE DISTRESS IN BC PATIENTS, BUT RCTS ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE FINDINGS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
15  918  30 EFFECTIVENESS OF TRAINING PROGRAM COMBINING CHAKRAYOGA AND MEDITATION. BACKGROUND THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PROGRAM COMBINING CHAKRAYOGA AND MEDITATION ON THE PHYSICAL HEALTH AND DISEASE-RELATED FACTORS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS OF PEOPLE. METHODS NINETY-SEVEN SUBJECTS (32-83 YEARS OLD) WHO HAD FREE FROM PRIOR EXPERIENCES IN MEDITATION PROGRAMS OR CHAKRAYOGA TRAINING COURSES WERE ASSIGNED TO EITHER THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (EXP) (45 SUBJECTS; 13 MALE SUBJECTS AND 32 FEMALE SUBJECTS; AVERAGE AGE OF 60.67 YEARS, SD=11.09 YEARS) OR THE CONTROL GROUP (CONT) OF REMAINING SUBJECTS (52 SUBJECTS; 14 MALE SUBJECTS AND 38 FEMALE SUBJECTS; AVERAGE AGE OF 61.58 YEARS, SD=9.70 YEARS). SUBJECTS IN THE EXP PARTICIPATED IN THE CHAKRAYOGA MEDITATION PROGRAM FOR TWICE A WEEK FOR 2 H DURING 6 WEEKS IN EACH SESSION CONSISTED OF 1 H OF CHAKRAYOGA AND 1 H OF MEDITATION. THE MEASUREMENTS IN THIS STUDY INCLUDED THE MINDFULNESS, STRESS RESPONSE, SUBJECTIVE QUALITY OF LIFE, MEDICAL SYMPTOM CHECKLIST, DIFFICULTY IN EMOTIONAL REGULATION AND OBJECTIVE OF LIFE AND SENSE OF CONTROL. RESULTS RESULTS REVEALED THAT PARTICIPANTS IN THE EXP REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE RELIEF OF MINDFULNESS, STRESS RESPONSE, SUBJECTIVE QUALITY OF LIFE AND MEDICAL SYMPTOM CHECKLIST THAN THOSE IN THE CONT. CONCLUSIONS THESE FINDINGS PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT THE CHAKRAYOGA MEDITATION PROGRAM CAN HELP RELIEVE THE PHYSICAL HEALTH AND DISEASE-RELATED FACTORS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
16  423  36 BRIEF YOGA INTERVENTION FOR DENTAL AND DENTAL HYGIENE STUDENTS: A FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY STUDY. THE PRESENT STUDY INVESTIGATED WHETHER A BRIEF YOGA INTERVENTION WOULD BE FEASIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE FOR DENTAL STUDENTS. BASED ON EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ABOUT STATE MINDFULNESS (SM), CHANGE IN SELF-REPORTED SM WAS ASSESSED AS A MEASURE OF THE INTERVENTION'S FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY. A REPEATED-MEASURES WITHIN-SUBJECTS DESIGN WAS USED. PARTICIPANTS WERE THIRD- AND FOURTH-YEAR DENTAL AND DENTAL HYGIENE STUDENTS (76% FEMALE). THE STATE MINDFULNESS SCALE (SMS), A VALIDATED SELF-REPORT MEASURE OF SM WITH 2 SUBSCALES, MIND AND BODY, WAS USED. STUDENTS (N = 132) COMPLETED THE SMS IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO AND FOLLOWING A 1-HOUR YOGA INTERVENTION. DISPOSITIONAL MINDFULNESS, BURNOUT, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS WERE ALSO INVESTIGATED AS MODERATORS OF CHANGES IN STATE MINDFULNESS TO DETERMINE WHETHER PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIABLES HAD AN EFFECT ON FEASIBILITY IN THIS SAMPLE. TOTAL SM SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FROM PRE- TO POST-INTERVENTION, T(46) = 10.26, P < .001. AN ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION EFFECT IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRE-/POST-INTERVENTION SM OF MIND (BETA = 0.51, P = .048), SUCH THAT HIGHER LEVELS OF STRESS SAW GREATER INCREASES IN SM OF MIND. NO OTHER PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIABLES WERE SIGNIFICANT MODERATORS. A BRIEF YOGA INTERVENTION FOR DENTAL STUDENTS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED SM, SUGGESTING THAT YOGA INTERVENTIONS MAY BE FEASIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE IN THIS POPULATION. THE RESULTS OF MODERATION ANALYSES SUGGEST THAT A BRIEF YOGA INTERVENTION MAY BE ESPECIALLY EFFECTIVE AT INCREASING SM FOR THOSE WITH HIGH LEVELS OF STRESS. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD USE A RANDOMIZED CONTROL GROUP TO TEST GROUP DIFFERENCES IN SM AFTER A BRIEF YOGA INTERVENTION FOR DENTAL STUDENTS.	2019

19  277  33 ADDITIONAL PRACTICE OF YOGA BREATHING WITH INTERMITTENT BREATH HOLDING ENHANCES PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS IN YOGA PRACTITIONERS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: THE PRACTICE OF YOGA IS ASSOCIATED WITH ENHANCED PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING. THE CURRENT STUDY ASSESSED THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE DURATION OF YOGA PRACTICE WITH STATE MINDFULNESS, MIND-WANDERING AND STATE ANXIETY. ALSO, WE EXAMINED IF AN ADDITIONAL 20 MIN OF YOGA BREATHING WITH INTERMITTENT BREATH HOLDING (EXPERIMENTAL GROUP) FOR 8 WEEKS WOULD AFFECT THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIABLES MORE THAN REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE (CONTROL GROUP) ALONE. METHODS: ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN SUBJECTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EXPERIMENTAL (N = 60) AND CONTROL (N = 56) GROUPS. STATE MINDFULNESS ATTENTION AWARENESS SCALE (SMAAS), MIND-WANDERING QUESTIONNAIRE (MWQ) AND STATE ANXIETY INVENTORY WERE ADMINISTERED AT BASELINE AND AT THE END OF 8 WEEKS. RESULTS: BASELINE ASSESSMENT REVEALED A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN DURATION OF YOGA PRACTICE WITH SMAAS SCORES AND NEGATIVE CORRELATION WITH MWQ AND STATE ANXIETY SCORES. AT THE END OF 8 WEEKS, BOTH GROUPS DEMONSTRATED ENHANCED PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS, BUT THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP RECEIVING ADDITIONAL YOGA BREATHING PERFORMED BETTER THAN THE GROUP PRACTICING YOGA ALONE. CONCLUSION: AN ADDITIONAL PRACTICE OF YOGA BREATHING WITH INTERMITTENT BREATH HOLDING WAS FOUND TO ENHANCE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS IN YOUNG ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
20 2833  32 YOGA'S EFFECT ON FALLS IN RURAL, OLDER ADULTS. BACKGROUND: UNINTENTIONAL FALLS AFFECT 30% OF PEOPLE OVER AGE 65 YEARS. YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE BALANCE. WE DESIGNED THIS STUDY TO EXAMINE IF YOGA REDUCES FALLS. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED 16 SESSIONS OF HATHA YOGA OVER 8 WEEKS. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO PRACTICE 10MIN OF YOGA DAILY AT HOME IN ADDITION TO 5-MIN RELAXATION EXERCISES OR RELAXATION EXERCISES ONLY (CONTROL GROUP). RESULTS: OF THE 38 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETING THE INTERVENTION, 15 PARTICIPANTS REPORTED A TOTAL OF 27 FALLS IN THE 6-MONTHS BEFORE THE STUDY, COMPARED TO 13 PARTICIPANTS SUSTAINING 14 FALLS IN THE 6 MONTHS FROM THE START OF THE STUDY (P<0.047), WITHOUT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOGA HOME-EXERCISE AND HOME RELAXATION-ONLY GROUPS. COMPARED TO BASELINE SCORES, ALL PARTICIPANTS IMPROVED ON THE BERG BALANCE SCALE (53-54 OUT OF 56, P=0.002), THE FUNCTIONAL GAIT ASSESSMENT (22.9-25.8 OUT OF 30 POINTS, P<0.001), AND THE DYNAMIC GAIT INDEX (20.6-22.4 OUT OF 24 POINTS, P<0.001). RIGHT LEG STAND TIME IMPROVED FROM A MEAN OF 13.3S TO 17.1S (P=0.020) AND STANDING FORWARD REACH DISTANCE FROM 26.0CM TO 29.6CM (P<0.001). WITHOUT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS. CONFIDENCE, WITH THE ACTIVITIES-SPECIFIC BALANCE CONFIDENCE SCALE, INCREASED IN THE YOGA HOME-EXERCISE GROUP (88%-93%, P=0.037) COMPARED TO 90% UNCHANGED FROM PRE-INTERVENTION IN THE HOME RELAXATION-ONLY GROUP. CONCLUSION: YOGA CLASSES REDUCE SELF-REPORTED FALLS AND IMPROVE BALANCE MEASURES. THE ADDITION OF HOME YOGA EXERCISES DID NOT ENHANCE BENEFIT OVER RELAXATION EXERCISE ONLY.	2017

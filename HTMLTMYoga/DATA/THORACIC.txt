1 1990 129 SPINAL CURVATURES OF YOGA PRACTITIONERS COMPARED TO CONTROL PARTICIPANTS-A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY. PURPOSE: THE ANGLES OF THORACIC KYPHOSIS AND LUMBAR LORDOSIS DETERMINE THE SPINAL ALIGNMENT IN THE SAGITTAL PLANE. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE THORACIC KYPHOSIS AND LUMBAR LORDOSIS OF MALE AND FEMALE YOGA PRACTITIONERS WITH NON-PRACTICING PARTICIPANTS AND TO DETERMINE THE POSSIBLE DEPENDENCIES BETWEEN SAGITTAL SPINAL CURVATURES AND SOMATIC PARAMETERS, TIME SPENT ON YOGA EXERCISE, AND UNDERTAKING OTHER PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES IN YOGA PRACTITIONERS. METHODS: THE STUDY INVOLVED 576 WOMEN AND 91 MEN AGES 18-68 YEARS (MEAN = 38.5 +/- 9) WHO WERE PRACTICING YOGA, AND 402 WOMEN AND 176 MEN AGES 18-30 YEARS (MEAN = 20.2 +/- 1.3) AS A CONTROL GROUP. THE ANGLES OF THORACIC KYPHOSIS AND LUMBAR LORDOSIS WERE MEASURED USING A PLURIMETER-V GRAVITY INCLINOMETER. RESULTS: THE TWO-WAY ANOVA DEMONSTRATED THE INFLUENCE OF GROUP (P < .0001) AND SEX (P = .03) ON THE ANGLE OF THORACIC KYPHOSIS, AS WELL AS THE INFLUENCE OF GROUP (P < .0001) AND SEX (P < .0001) ON THE ANGLE OF LUMBAR LORDOSIS. IT WAS NOTED THAT YOGA PRACTITIONERS HAD LESS PRONOUNCED THORACIC KYPHOSIS AND LUMBAR LORDOSIS AND WERE MORE OFTEN CHARACTERIZED BY NORMAL OR SMALLER THORACIC KYPHOSIS AND LUMBAR LORDOSIS THAN STUDENTS FROM THE CONTROL GROUP. IN YOGA PRACTITIONERS, THE ANGLE OF THORACIC KYPHOSIS WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH AGE, BODY MASS, BMI, AND UNDERTAKING OTHER FORMS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. THE ANGLE OF LUMBAR LORDOSIS WAS NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH BODY HEIGHT AND BODY MASS. CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA EXERCISES CAN AFFECT THE SHAPE OF THE ANTERIOR-POSTERIOR CURVES OF THE SPINE AND MAY BE AN EFFICIENT TRAINING METHOD FOR SHAPING PROPER POSTURE IN ADULTS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
2 2209  28 THE GEOMETRIC CURVATURE OF THE SPINE DURING THE SIRSHASANA, THE YOGA'S HEADSTAND. THIS STUDY ANALYSED THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE GEOMETRIC CURVATURE OF THE SPINE DURING SIRSHASANA. THE POSITION OF DORSAL RETROREFLECTIVE MARKERS WAS COMPUTED VIA STEREOPHOTOGRAMMETRIC ANALYSIS IN SIX MALES AND FIVE FEMALES (29.4 +/- 8.8 YEARS, 63.0 +/- 11.4 KG, 1.66 +/- 0.08 M [AVERAGE +/- STANDARD DEVIATION]). THE SPINAL POINTS WERE PROJECTED ONTO THE SAGITTAL AND FRONTAL PLANES OF THE TRUNK, A POLYNOMIAL WAS FITTED TO THE DATA AND THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL GEOMETRIC CURVATURE WAS QUANTIFIED. THE INFERIOR LUMBAR LORDOSIS DECREASED COMPARED TO THE ORTHOSTATIC POSITION AND GAIT, WHICH MAY FAVOUR THE POSTERIOR PROTRUSION OF THE LUMBAR SPINAL NUCLEUS PULPOSUS IN PEOPLE WITH POSTERIOR HERNIATION. THE LATERAL DEVIATION AT THE MIDDLE OF THE THORACIC SPINE INCREASES DURING SIRSHASANA, WHICH MAY REFLECT INCREASED DIFFICULTIES FOR POSTURAL CONTROL AND SPINAL LOADS. IT COULD BE USEFUL FOR PROMOTING POSITIVE SPINAL STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL CHRONIC ADAPTATIONS FOR HEALTHY PARTICIPANTS, IF THE YOGA PROGRAMME IS CAREFULLY PLANNED AND THE SPINAL ALIGNMENT IS CAREFULLY MONITORED DURING A HEADSTAND. HOWEVER, IT MAY AGGRAVATE SOME SPINAL DISEASES, ESPECIALLY SCOLIOSIS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
3  552  26 CORE MUSCLE FUNCTION DURING SPECIFIC YOGA POSES. OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL USE OF 11 YOGA POSES IN SPECIFIC TRAINING AND REHABILITATION PROGRAMS VIA EXAMINATION OF THE MUSCLE ACTIVATION PATTERNS IN SELECTED TRUNK AND HIP MUSCLES. DESIGN: REPEATED-MEASURES DESCRIPTIVE STUDY. SETTING: UNIVERSITY LABORATORY, US. PARTICIPANTS: THIRTY HEALTHY YOGA PRACTITIONERS WITH MORE THAN 3 MONTHS YOGA PRACTICE EXPERIENCE (MEAN AGE+/-SD, 32.0+/-12.3 Y; 8 M/22 F) PARTICIPATED. INTERVENTIONS: SURFACE ELECTROMYOGRAPHIC SIGNALS OF UPPER RECTUS ABDOMINIS, LOWER RECTUS ABDOMINIS, LONGISSIMUS THORACIS, EXTERNAL OBLIQUE ABDOMINIS AND GLUTEUS MAXIMUM MUSCLE WERE RECORDED IN 11 YOGA POSES: HALFWAY LIFT, FORWARD FOLD, DOWNWARD FACING DOG, UPWARD FACING DOG, HIGH PLANK, LOW PLANK, CHAIR, MOUNTAIN WITH ARMS DOWN, MOUNTAIN WITH ARMS UP, WARRIOR 1 (BOTH SIDES). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ROOT MEAN SQUARE VALUES OF EACH MUSCLE DURING EACH POSE, NORMALIZED BY THE MAXIMAL VOLUNTARY CONTRACTION. RESULTS: THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT MAIN EFFECTS OF POSE (P<.001) AND MUSCLE (P<.001), AND A SIGNIFICANT POSEXMUSCLE INTERACTION (P=.001). THE POST HOC ANALYSIS REVEALED UNIQUE PATTERNS FOR THE FIVE MUSCLES OF INTEREST FOR EACH OF THE 11 POSES (P<.024). CONCLUSIONS: VARIATIONS IN CORE MUSCLE FIRING PATTERNS DEPEND ON THE TRUNK AND PELVIC POSITIONS DURING THESE POSES. TRAINING PROGRAMS CAN BE DEVELOPED BY CHOOSING PARTICULAR POSES TO TARGET SPECIFIC CORE MUSCLES FOR ADDRESSING LOW BACK PAIN AND DECLINES IN PERFORMANCE. THE HIGH PLANK, LOW PLANK AND DOWNWARD FACING DOG POSES ARE EFFECTIVE FOR STRENGTHENING EXTERNAL OBLIQUE ABDOMINIS, CHAIR AND WARRIOR 1 POSES FOR TARGETING GLUTEUS MAXIMUM, AND CHAIR AND HALFWAY LIFT POSES FOR STRENGTHENING LONGISSIMUS THORACIS. AND THESE THREE MUSCLES COULD BE STRENGTHENED BY THE UPWARD FACING DOG POSE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
4 1524  28 ISOMETRIC YOGA-LIKE MANEUVERS IMPROVE ADOLESCENT IDIOPATHIC SCOLIOSIS-A NONRANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: ASSESS THERAPEUTIC VALUE OF SPECIFIC YOGA POSES FOR THORACIC AND LUMBAR ADOLESCENT IDIOPATHIC SCOLIOSIS (AIS) TAUGHT IN OFFICE OR INTERNET. STUDY DESIGN: NONRANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL: FIFTY-SIX ADOLESCENTS (MEAN AGE 14.0 YEARS; MEAN RISSER 3.0) WERE RECRUITED FROM OUR CLINIC; 41 DID THE SIDE-PLANK, THE HALF-MOON AND ELEVATED SIDE PLANK POSES AS APPROPRIATE (TREATMENT GROUP) AND 15 DID NOT (CONTROLS). THIRTY CURVES WERE TREATED IN OFFICE, 30 VIA INTERNET. CURVE CHANGE WAS EVALUATED BY BLINDED SERIAL COBB ANGLES, AND ANALYZED USING MANN-WHITNEY U, PAIRED T-TESTS AND CHI(2). RESULTS: MEAN LUMBAR AND THORACOLUMBAR COBB ANGLE CHANGE WAS -9.2 (95% CI = -11.8, -6.6) IN THE TREATMENT GROUP AND 5.4 (95% CI = 1.7, 9.0) IN CONTROLS. BOTH TREATMENT GROUP IMPROVEMENT AND DETERIORATION IN CONTROLS WERE SIGNIFICANT (TREATMENT GROUP: PAIRED T-TEST T = -7.1, DF = 40, P = .000; CONTROLS: T = 3.2, DF = 12, P = .008). MEAN THORACIC COBB ANGLE CHANGE WAS -7.1 (95% CI = -13.1, -1.2) IN THE TREATMENT GROUP AND 9.3 (95% CI = 4.5, 14.6) IN CONTROLS. BOTH CHANGES WERE SIGNIFICANT (PAIRED T-TEST T = -3.3, DF = 21, P = .022 FOR TREATMENT GROUP; T = 4.5, DF = 5, P = .006 FOR CONTROLS). NINE INTERNET PATIENTS WERE NON-COMPLIANT VS. 6 OFFICE PATIENTS. OFFICE PATIENTS IMPROVED 1.6 DEGREES/MONTH OR 5.5%/MONTH; INTERNET PATIENTS IMPROVED .72 DEGREES/MONTH OR 3.3%/MONTH. CONCLUSION: THESE YOGA POSES SHOW PROMISE FOR REVERSING ADOLESCENT IDIOPATHIC SCOLIOSIS. TELEMEDICINE HAD GREATER NON-COMPLIANCE AND LOWER EFFICACY BUT STILL PRODUCED PATIENT IMPROVEMENT.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
5 2656  31 YOGA IMPROVES UPPER-EXTREMITY FUNCTION AND SCAPULAR POSTURING IN PERSONS WITH HYPERKYPHOSIS. OBJECTIVE: HYPERKYPHOSIS (EXCESS THORACIC SPINE CURVATURE) IS ASSOCIATED WITH UPPER-EXTREMITY FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS AND ALTERED SCAPULAR POSTURING. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO QUANTIFY THE CHANGES IN UPPER-EXTREMITY FUNCTION AND SCAPULAR POSTURING FOLLOWING A 6-MONTH YOGAINTERVENTION IN PERSONS WITH HYPERKYPHOSIS. METHODS: TWENTY-ONE OLDER ADULTS WITH HYPERKYPHOSIS (75.5+7.4 YRS) ENROLLED IN THE UCLA YOGA FOR KYPHOSIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, ELECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS UNCONTROLLED, PREPOST SUBSTUDY OF UPPER-EXTREMITY FUNCTION. THEY WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE AND AFTER A 24-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. MAXIMUM VERTICAL REACH AND TIMED BOOK TESTS WERE USED TO EVALUATE UPPER-EXTREMITY FUNCTION. SCAPULAR POSTURING WAS QUANTIFIED USING A MOTION ANALYSIS SYSTEM AND DATA WAS OBTAINED UNDER 4 CONDITIONS: 1) QUIET-STANDING, 2) NORMAL WALKING, 3) FAST WALKING, AND 4) SEATED. PAIRED T-TESTS WERE USED TO TEST FOR CHANGES BETWEEN BASELINE AND 6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP MEASURES AND COHEN'S D WAS CALCULATED TO EXAMINE EFFECT SIZES. RESULTS: FOLLOWING THE 6-MONTH YOGA INTERVENTION, PARTICIPANTS IMPROVED THEIR BOOK TEST PERFORMANCE BY 26.4% (P < 0.001; D = 1.5). SCAPULAR PROTRACTION DECREASED BY 2.9% DURING THE STATIC-SITTING CONDITION (P < 0.001; D = 0.5) AND THE OVERALL EXCURSION OF THE SCAPULAE DECREASED FOR BOTH FAST (25.0%, P < 0.05; D = 0.6) AND SELF-SELECTED WALKING (29.4%, P < 0.01; D = 0.9). THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN MAXIMUM VERTICAL REACH. CONCLUSION: SUBJECTS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WITH SMALL TO LARGE EFFECT SIZES IN THE TIMED BOOK TEST AND SCAPULAR POSTURING TO A LESS PROTRACTED POSITION DURING BOTH STATIC AND DYNAMIC CONDITIONS AFTER THE INTERVENTION. THESE ADAPTATIONS ARE LIKELY TO REDUCE THE RISK OF SCAPULAR IMPINGEMENT AND HELP PRESERVE FUNCTIONAL INDEPENDENCE IN OLDER ADULTS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
6  626  24 DIFFERENCE IN MUSCLE ACTIVATION PATTERNS DURING HIGH-SPEED VERSUS STANDARD-SPEED YOGA: A RANDOMIZED SEQUENCE CROSSOVER STUDY. OBJECTIVES: TO COMPARE THE DIFFERENCE IN MUSCLE ACTIVATION BETWEEN HIGH-SPEED YOGA AND STANDARD-SPEED YOGA AND TO COMPARE MUSCLE ACTIVATION OF THE TRANSITIONS BETWEEN POSES AND THE HELD PHASES OF A YOGA POSE. DESIGN: RANDOMIZED SEQUENCE CROSSOVER TRIAL SETTING: A LABORATORY OF NEUROMUSCULAR RESEARCH AND ACTIVE AGING INTERVENTIONS: EIGHT MINUTES OF CONTINUOUS SUN SALUTATION B WAS PERFORMED, AT A HIGH SPEED VERSUS A STANDARD-SPEED, SEPARATELY. ELECTROMYOGRAPHY WAS USED TO QUANTIFY NORMALIZED MUSCLE ACTIVATION PATTERNS OF EIGHT UPPER AND LOWER BODY MUSCLES (PECTORALIS MAJOR, MEDIAL DELTOIDS, LATERAL HEAD OF THE TRICEPS, MIDDLE FIBERS OF THE TRAPEZIUS, VASTUS MEDIALIS, MEDIAL GASTROCNEMIUS, THORACIC EXTENSOR SPINAE, AND EXTERNAL OBLIQUES) DURING THE HIGH-SPEED AND STANDARD-SPEED YOGA PROTOCOLS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: DIFFERENCE IN NORMALIZED MUSCLE ACTIVATION BETWEEN HIGH-SPEED YOGA AND STANDARD-SPEED YOGA. RESULTS: NORMALIZED MUSCLE ACTIVITY SIGNALS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN ALL EIGHT MUSCLES DURING THE TRANSITION PHASES OF POSES COMPARED TO THE HELD PHASES (P<0.01). THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION BETWEEN SPEEDXPHASE; HOWEVER, GREATER NORMALIZED MUSCLE ACTIVITY WAS SEEN FOR HIGHSPEED YOGA ACROSS THE ENTIRE SESSION. CONCLUSIONS: OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT TRANSITIONS FROM ONE HELD PHASE OF A POSE TO ANOTHER PRODUCES HIGHER NORMALIZED MUSCLE ACTIVITY THAN THE HELD PHASES OF THE POSES AND THAT OVERALL ACTIVITY IS GREATER DURING HIGHSPEED YOGA THAN STANDARD-SPEED YOGA. THEREFORE, THE TRANSITION SPEED AND ASSOCIATED NUMBER OF POSES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHEN TARGETING SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS IN PERFORMANCE.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
7 2328  23 TRUNK AND HIP MUSCLE ACTIVATION DURING YOGA POSES: DO SEX-DIFFERENCES EXIST? OBJECTIVE: TO COMPARE CORE ACTIVATION DURING YOGA BETWEEN MALES AND FEMALES. METHODS: SURFACE ELECTROMYOGRAPHY WAS USED TO QUANTIFY RECTUS ABDOMINIS (RA), ABDOMINAL OBLIQUES (AO), LUMBAR EXTENSORS (LE), AND GLUTEUS MAXIMUS (GMX) ACTIVATION DURING FOUR YOGA POSES. DATA WERE EXPRESSED AS 100% OF A MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY ISOMETRIC CONTRACTION. MIXED-MODEL 2X2 ANALYSES OF VARIANCE WITH REPEATED MEASURES WERE USED TO DETERMINE BETWEEN-SEX DIFFERENCES IN MUSCLE ACTIVITY. RESULTS: FEMALES GENERATED GREATER RA ACTIVITY THAN MALES DURING THE HIGH PLANK (P<0.0001) AND DOMINANT-SIDE WARRIOR 1 (P=0.017). THEY GENERATED GREATER AO (P<0.0001) AND GMX (P=0.004) ACTIVITY DURING THE HIGH PLANK (P<0.0001). NO BETWEEN-SEX EMG ACTIVITY DIFFERENCES EXISTED FOR THE CHAIR AND UPWARD FACING DOG. CONCLUSION: FINDINGS HAVE PROVIDED PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE FOR BETWEEN-SEX DIFFERENCES IN MUSCLE ACTIVATION DURING YOGA POSES.

BACKGROUND: NON-SURGICAL TECHNIQUES FOR TREATING SCOLIOSIS FREQUENTLY FOCUS ON REALIGNING THE SPINE, TYPICALLY BY MUSCULAR RELAXATION OR MUSCULAR OR LIGAMENTOUS STRETCHING. HOWEVER, SUCH TREATMENTS, WHICH INCLUDE PHYSICAL THERAPEUTIC, CHIROPRACTIC, AND BRACING TECHNIQUES, ARE INCONSISTENTLY SUPPORTED BY CURRENT EVIDENCE. IN THIS STUDY, WE ASSESS THE POSSIBLE BENEFITS OF ASYMMETRICAL STRENGTHENING OF TRUNCAL MUSCLES ON THE CONVEX SIDE OF THE SCOLIOTIC CURVE THROUGH A SINGLE YOGA POSE, THE SIDE PLANK POSE, IN IDIOPATHIC AND DEGENERATIVE SCOLIOSIS. METHODS: TWENTY-FIVE PATIENTS WITH IDIOPATHIC OR DEGENERATIVE SCOLIOSIS AND PRIMARY CURVES MEASURING 6 TO 120 DEGREES BY THE COBB METHOD HAD SPINAL RADIOGRAPHS AND WERE THEN TAUGHT THE SIDE PLANK POSE. AFTER 1 WEEK PERFORMING THE POSE WITH CONVEXITY DOWNWARD FOR 10 TO 20 SECONDS, THEY WERE INSTRUCTED TO MAINTAIN THE POSTURE ONCE DAILY FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE ON THAT ONE SIDE ONLY. A SECOND SERIES OF SPINAL RADIOGRAPHS WAS TAKEN 3 TO 22 MONTHS LATER. PRE- AND POST-YOGA COBB MEASUREMENTS WERE COMPARED. RESULTS: THE MEAN SELF-REPORTED PRACTICE OF THE YOGA POSE WAS 1.5 MINUTES PER DAY, 6.1 DAYS PER WEEK, FOR A MEAN FOLLOW-UP PERIOD OF 6.8 MONTHS. AMONG ALL PATIENTS, A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE COBB ANGLE OF THE PRIMARY SCOLIOTIC CURVE OF 32.0% WAS FOUND. AMONG 19 COMPLIANT PATIENTS, THE MEAN IMPROVEMENT ROSE TO 40.9%. IMPROVEMENTS DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY AMONG ADOLESCENT IDIOPATHIC AND DEGENERATIVE SUBTYPES (49.6% AND 38.4%, RESPECTIVELY). CONCLUSIONS: ASYMMETRICALLY STRENGTHENING THE CONVEX SIDE OF THE PRIMARY CURVE WITH DAILY PRACTICE OF THE SIDE PLANK POSE HELD FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE FOR AN AVERAGE OF 6.8 MONTHS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE ANGLE OF PRIMARY SCOLIOTIC CURVES. THESE RESULTS WARRANT FURTHER TESTING.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
9  908  27 EFFECTIVENESS OF DEEP CERVICAL FASCIAL MANIPULATION AND YOGA POSTURES ON PAIN, FUNCTION, AND OCULOMOTOR CONTROL IN PATIENTS WITH MECHANICAL NECK PAIN: STUDY PROTOCOL OF A PRAGMATIC, PARALLEL-GROUP, RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: MECHANICAL NECK PAIN (MNP) IS A COMMONLY OCCURRING MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITION THAT IS USUALLY MANAGED USING ELECTRICAL MODALITIES, JOINT MOBILIZATION TECHNIQUES, AND THERAPEUTIC EXERCISES, BUT HAS LIMITED EVIDENCE OF THEIR EFFICACY. PATHOLOGY (DENSIFICATION) OF THE DEEP CERVICAL FASCIA THAT OCCURS DUE TO THE INCREASED VISCOSITY OF HYALURONIC ACID (HA) MAY INDUCE NECK PAIN AND ASSOCIATED PAINFUL SYMPTOMS OF THE UPPER QUARTER REGION. FASCIAL MANIPULATION (FM) AND YOGA POSES ARE CONSIDERED TO REDUCE THE THIXOTROPY OF THE GROUND SUBSTANCES OF THE DEEP FASCIA AND IMPROVE MUSCLE FUNCTION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF FM AND SEQUENTIAL YOGA POSES (SYP) WHEN COMPARED TO THE USUAL CARE ON PAIN, FUNCTION, AND OCULOMOTOR CONTROL IN MNP. METHODS: THIS FACE-MAN TRIAL WILL RECRUIT 160 PATIENTS WITH SUBACUTE AND CHRONIC MECHANICAL NECK PAIN DIAGNOSED USING PREDEFINED CRITERIA. PARTICIPANTS WILL BE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER THE INTERVENTION GROUP OR THE USUAL CARE GROUP, USING A RANDOM ALLOCATION RATIO OF 1:1. PATIENTS IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP WILL RECEIVE FM (4 SESSIONS IN 4 WEEKS) AND SYP (12 WEEKS) WHEREAS THE STANDARD CARE GROUP WILL RECEIVE CERVICAL MOBILIZATION/ THORACIC MANIPULATION (4 SESSIONS IN 4 WEEKS) AND THERAPEUTIC EXERCISES (12 WEEKS). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME IS THE CHANGE IN THE NUMERIC PAIN RATING SCALE (NPRS). THE SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDE CHANGES IN THE PATIENT-SPECIFIC FUNCTIONAL SCALE AND OCULOMOTOR CONTROL, MYOFASCIAL STIFFNESS, FEAR-AVOIDANCE BEHAVIOR QUESTIONNAIRE, AND ELBOW EXTENSION RANGE OF MOTION DURING NEURODYNAMICS TEST 1. DISCUSSION: IF FOUND EFFECTIVE, FM ALONG WITH SYP INVESTIGATED IN THIS TRIAL CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A TREATMENT STRATEGY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF MECHANICAL NECK PAIN. CONSIDERING THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM, AND THE PRAGMATIC AND PATIENT-CENTERED APPROACH TO BE FOLLOWED, IT IS WORTH INVESTIGATING THIS TRIAL.

10 1654  33 MUSCLE UTILIZATION PATTERNS VARY BY SKILL LEVELS OF THE PRACTITIONERS ACROSS SPECIFIC YOGA POSES (ASANAS). OBJECTIVE: TO COMPARE MUSCLE ACTIVATION PATTERNS IN 14 DOMINANT SIDE MUSCLES DURING DIFFERENT YOGA POSES ACROSS THREE SKILL LEVELS. DESIGN: MIXED REPEATED-MEASURES DESCRIPTIVE STUDY. SETTING: UNIVERSITY NEUROMUSCULAR RESEARCH LABORATORY, MIAMI, US. PARTICIPANTS: A GROUP OF 36 YOGA PRACTITIONERS (9 M/27 F; MEAN +/- SD, 31.6 +/- 12.6 YEARS) WITH AT LEAST 3 MONTHS YOGA PRACTICE EXPERIENCE. INTERVENTIONS: EACH OF THE 11 SURYA NAMASKAR POSES A AND B WAS PERFORMED SEPARATELY FOR 15S AND THE SURFACE ELECTROMYOGRAPHY FOR 14 MUSCLES WERE RECORDED. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: NORMALIZED ROOT MEAN SQUARE OF THE ELECTROMYOGRAPHIC SIGNAL (NRMSEMG) FOR 14 MUSCLES (5 UPPER BODY, 4 TRUNK, 5 LOWER BODY). RESULTS: THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT MAIN EFFECTS OF POSE FOR ALL FOURTEEN MUSCLES EXCEPT MIDDLE TRAPEZIUS (P<.02) AND OF SKILL LEVEL FOR THE VASTUS MEDIALIS; P=.027). A SIGNIFICANT SKILL LEVEL X POSE INTERACTION EXISTED FOR FIVE MUSCLES (PECTORALIS MAJOR STERNAL HEAD, ANTERIOR DELTOID, MEDIAL DELTOID, UPPER RECTUS ABDOMINIS AND GASTROCNEMIUS LATERALIS; P<.05). POST HOC ANALYSES USING BONFERRONI COMPARISONS INDICATED THAT DIFFERENT POSES ACTIVATED SPECIFIC MUSCLE GROUPS; HOWEVER, THIS VARIED BY SKILL LEVEL. CONCLUSION: OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT DIFFERENT POSES CAN PRODUCE SPECIFIC MUSCLE ACTIVATION PATTERNS WHICH MAY VARY DUE TO PRACTITIONERS' SKILL LEVELS. THIS INFORMATION CAN BE USED IN DESIGNING REHABILITATION AND TRAINING PROGRAMS AND FOR CUING DURING YOGA TRAINING.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
11 1272  27 FROM 200 BC TO 2015 AD: AN INTEGRATION OF ROBOTIC SURGERY AND AYURVEDA/YOGA. BACKGROUND: AMONG THE TRADITIONAL SYSTEMS OF MEDICINE PRACTICED ALL OVER THE WORLD, AYURVEDA AND YOGA HAS A DOCUMENTED HISTORY DATING BACK TO BEYOND 200 BC. ROBOTIC AND VIDEO ASSISTED THORACIC SURGERY (VATS) IS AN INVENTION OF THE 21(ST) CENTURY. WE AIM TO QUANTIFY THE EFFECTS OF INTEGRATION OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA ON PATIENTS UNDERGOING MINIMALLY INVASIVE ROBOTIC AND VATS. METHODS: FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY-FOUR PATIENTS UNDERGOING VATS AND ROBOTIC THORACIC SURGERY WERE INTRODUCED TO A PRE AND POSTOPERATIVE PROTOCOL OF YOGA THERAPY, MEDIATION AND OIL MASSAGES. YOGA EXERCISES INCLUDED PRANAYAM, ANULOM VILOM, AND OIL MASSAGES INCLUDED UROTARPAN. PREOPERATIVE AND POSTOPERATIVE RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS WERE RECORDED. PATIENT SATISFACTION QUESTIONNAIRE WERE NOTED. STATISTICAL COMPARISON WAS MADE TO CONTROL GROUP UNDERGOING MINIMALLY INVASIVE THORACIC SURGERY WITHOUT INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE. ONLY ONE PATIENT REFUSED TO UNDERGO AYURVEDA THERAPY AND WAS DELETED FROM THE GROUP. RESULTS: ACCEPTABILITY WAS HIGH AMONG ALL PATIENTS. PREOPERATIVE TRAINING LED TO IMPLEMENTATION AS EARLY AS 6 HOURS POST SURGERY. PULMONARY FUNCTION TEST SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. ALL PATIENTS SUGGESTED AN IMPROVEMENT IN SATISFACTION SCORE. PAIN SCORE WERE LESS IN STUDY PATIENTS. QUICKER MOBILIZATION LED TO EARLY DISCHARGE AND DRAIN REMOVAL. CHRONIC PAIN WAS PREVENTED IN PATIENTS HAVING OIL MASSAGES OVER THE HEALED WOUND SITES. CONCLUSIONS: INTEGRATION OF AYURVEDA, YOGA AND MINIMALLY INVASIVE ROBOTIC AND VATS IS ACCEPTABLE TO INDIAN PATIENTS AND GIVES BETTER CLINICAL RESULTS AND HIGHER PATIENT SATISFACTION.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
12  648  29 DYADIC YOGA PROGRAM FOR PATIENTS UNDERGOING THORACIC RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS: RESULTS OF A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: THORACIC RADIOTHERAPY (TRT) MAY RESULT IN TOXICITIES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH PERFORMANCE DECLINES AND POOR QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) FOR PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS TO ESTABLISH FEASIBILITY AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF A DYADIC YOGA (DY) INTERVENTION AS A SUPPORTIVE CARE STRATEGY. METHODS: PATIENTS WITH STAGE I TO III NON-SMALL CELL LUNG OR ESOPHAGEAL CANCER UNDERGOING TRT AND THEIR CAREGIVERS (N = 26 DYADS) WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 15-SESSION DY OR A WAITLIST CONTROL (WLC) GROUP. PRIOR TO TRT AND RANDOMIZATION, BOTH GROUPS COMPLETED MEASURES OF QOL (SF-36) AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (CES-D). PATIENTS ALSO COMPLETED THE 6-MINUTE WALK TEST (6MWT). DYADS WERE REASSESSED ON THE LAST DAY OF TRT AND 3 MONTHS LATER. RESULTS: A PRIORI FEASIBILITY CRITERIA WERE MET REGARDING CONSENT (68%), ADHERENCE (80%), AND RETENTION (81%) RATES. CONTROLLING FOR RELEVANT COVARIATES, MULTILEVEL MODELING ANALYSES REVEALED SIGNIFICANT CLINICAL IMPROVEMENTS FOR PATIENTS IN THE DY GROUP COMPARED WITH THE WLC GROUP FOR THE 6MWT (MEANS: DY = 473 M VS WLC = 397 M, D = 1.19) AND SF-36 PHYSICAL FUNCTION (MEANS: DY = 38.77 VS WLC = 30.88; D = .66) AND SOCIAL FUNCTION (MEANS: DY = 45.24 VS WLC = 39.09; D = .44) ACROSS THE FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. CAREGIVERS IN THE DY GROUP REPORTED MARGINALLY CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN SF-36 VITALITY (MEANS: DY = 53.05 VS WLC = 48.84; D = .39) AND ROLE PERFORMANCE (MEANS: DY = 52.78 VS WLC = 48.59; D = .51) RELATIVE TO THOSE IN THE WLC GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: THIS NOVEL SUPPORTIVE CARE PROGRAM APPEARS TO BE FEASIBLE AND BENEFICIAL FOR PATIENTS UNDERGOING TRT AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. A LARGER EFFICACY TRIAL WITH A MORE STRINGENT CONTROL GROUP IS WARRANTED.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
13 2329  29 TRUNK AND HIP MUSCLE ACTIVATION DURING YOGA POSES: IMPLICATIONS FOR PHYSICAL THERAPY PRACTICE. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE AND COMPARE ACTIVATION OF CORE MUSCLES DURING YOGA TO TRADITIONAL BACK EXERCISES. METHODS: SURFACE ELECTROMYOGRAPHY WAS USED TO QUANTIFY ACTIVATION OF THE RECTUS ABDOMINIS (RA), ABDOMINAL OBLIQUES (AO), LUMBAR EXTENSORS (LE), AND GLUTEUS MAXIMUS (GMX) DURING FOUR YOGA POSES. DATA WERE EXPRESSED AS 100% OF A MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY ISOMETRIC CONTRACTION. SEPARATE ANALYSES OF VARIANCE WITH REPEATED MEASURES WERE USED TO COMPARE MUSCLE ACTIVITY ACROSS EACH EXERCISE. RESULTS: SUBJECTS GENERATED GREATER RA (P < 0.0001) AND AO (P < 0.0001) ACTIVITY DURING THE PLANK. THEY GENERATED GREATER AO ACTIVITY (P < 0.0001) DURING THE UPWARD-FACING DOG THAN THE CHAIR AND DOMINANT-SIDE WARRIOR 1. LE ACTIVITY WAS GREATEST (P < 0.0001) DURING THE CHAIR. GMX ACTIVITY WAS SIMILAR (P = 0.09) DURING ALL EXERCISES. CONCLUSION: YOGA POSES MAY HELP IMPROVE CORE ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH. CLINICIANS MAY USE THESE DATA WHEN DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING AN EVIDENCE-BASED CORE EXERCISE PROGRAM FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO PREFER A YOGA TREATMENT STRATEGY.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
14  322  22 ANKLE MOTION IN COMMON YOGA POSES. BACKGROUND: MOTION OF THE ANKLE IS ESSENTIAL FOR MANY YOGA POSES. AN UNDERSTANDING OF RANGE OF ANKLE MOTION DURING TYPICAL YOGA POSES MAY HELP THE CLINICIAN TO UNDERSTAND EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF PATIENTS WHEN RETURNING FROM ANKLE SURGERY OR INJURY TO YOGA. METHODS: THE BIOMECHANICS OF TWENTY HEALTHY ACTIVE YOGIS WERE COLLECTED DURING SEVEN YOGA POSES THAT ARE COMMON WITHIN THEIR PRACTICES. MOTION CAPTURE AND FORCE PLATES WERE USED TO ASSESS THE RANGE OF MOTION AND JOINT MOMENTS OF THE ANKLE FOR EACH POSE. RESULTS: ALL POSES RESULTED IN PLANTARFLEXION AND EXTERNAL ROTATION MOMENTS AT THE ANKLE JOINTS. JOINT LOADING WAS HIGHEST IN SINGLE LEG POSES. THE ARC OF MOTION USED BY THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS IN THE POSES WAS 29 DEGREES OF SAGITTAL MOTION, 20 DEGREES OF FRONTAL MOTION AND 35 DEGREES OF TRANSVERSE MOTION. DISCUSSION: ANKLE MOTION WAS EVALUATED WHEN HEALTHY YOGIS PERFORM STANDARD POSES. THESE RESULTS MAY HELP IN DISCUSSION WITH PATIENTS REGARDING EXPECTED OUTCOMES AFTER ANKLE INJURY OR SURGERY.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
15 1798  25 PREOPERATIVE REHABILITATION IN LUNG CANCER PATIENTS: YOGA APPROACH. LUNG CANCER IS ONE OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF CANCER DEATH WORLDWIDE. SURGICAL REMOVAL REMAINS THE BEST OPTION FOR MOST TUMORS OF THIS TYPE. REDUCTION OF CIGARETTE CONSUMPTION IN PATIENTS WITH LUNG CANCER CANDIDATES FOR THE SURGERY COULD LIMIT THE IMPACT OF TOBACCO ON POSTSURGICAL OUTCOMES. BREATHING EXERCISES APPEAR TO HELP COMBAT CIGARETTE CRAVINGS. YOGA EXERCISE BENEFITS HAVE BEEN STUDIED IN LUNG CANCER SURVIVORS, RATHER THAN IN THE PREOPERATIVE SETTING. IN THIS STUDY, WE HAVE RECRUITED 32 ACTIVE SMOKERS AFFECTED BY LUNG CANCER AND BEING CANDIDATES FOR PULMONARY SURGERY. THE PATIENTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO TWO GROUPS: ONE TREATED BY STANDARD BREATHING AND THE OTHER TREATED BY YOGA BREATHING (YB). THE GROUPS WERE EVALUATED AT TIMES T0 (BASELINE) AND T1 (AFTER 7 DAYS OF TREATMENT) TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF THE TWO BREATHING TREATMENTS ON PULMONARY PERFORMANCE IN A PRESURGERY SETTING. PULMONARY AND CARDIOCIRCULATORY FUNCTIONS HAVE BEEN TESTED USING A SELF-CALIBRATING COMPUTERIZED SPIROMETER AND A PORTABLE PULSE OXIMETRY DEVICE. THE FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE APPRECIABLE SHORT-TERM IMPROVEMENT IN LUNG FUNCTION ASSESSED BY SPIROMETRY. WE CONCLUDE THAT YOGA BREATHING CAN BE A BENEFICIAL PREOPERATIVE SUPPORT FOR THORACIC SURGERY.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
16 1437  28 INCORPORATING YOGA INTO AN INTENSE PHYSICAL THERAPY PROGRAM IN SOMEONE WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE: A CASE REPORT. PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS CASE REPORT WAS TO DOCUMENT OUTCOMES FOLLOWING AN INTENSE EXERCISE PROGRAM INTEGRATING YOGA WITH PHYSICAL THERAPY EXERCISE IN A MALE WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE. METHOD: THE PARTICIPANT PERFORMED AN INTENSE 1(1/2)-HOUR PROGRAM (PHASE A) INCORPORATING STRENGTHENING, BALANCE, AGILITY AND YOGA EXERCISES TWICE WEEKLY FOR 12 WEEKS. HE THEN COMPLETED A NEW HOME EXERCISE PROGRAM DEVELOPED BY THE RESEARCHERS (PHASE B) FOR 12 WEEKS. RESULTS: HIS SCORE ON THE PARKINSON'S DISEASE QUESTIONNAIRE IMPROVED 16 POINTS WHILE HIS SCORE ON THE HIGH LEVEL MOBILITY ASSESSMENT TOOL IMPROVED 11 POINTS. THERE WERE ALSO IMPROVEMENTS IN MUSCLE LENGTH OF SEVERAL LOWER EXTREMITY MUSCLES, IN UPPER AND LOWER EXTREMITY MUSCLE STRENGTH, IN DYNAMIC BALANCE AND HE CONTINUES TO WORK FULL TIME 29 MONTHS LATER. THERE WERE NO IMPROVEMENTS IN THORACIC POSTURE OR AEROBIC POWER. DISCUSSION: THIS INTENSE PROGRAM WAS AN EFFECTIVE DOSE OF EXERCISE FOR SOMEONE WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE AND ALLOWED HIM TO CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE IN WORK, LEISURE, AND COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
17 2306  30 TRAINING BENEFITS AND INJURY RISKS OF STANDING YOGA APPLIED IN MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS: LOWER LIMB BIOMECHANICAL ANALYSIS. STANDING YOGA POSES STRENGTHEN A PERSON'S LEGS AND HELPS TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF MUSCULOSKELETAL REHABILITATION, BUT INADEQUATE EXERCISE PLANNING CAN CAUSE INJURIES. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED CHANGES IN THE ELECTROMYOGRAM AND JOINT MOMENTS OF FORCE (JMOFS) OF LOWER EXTREMITIES DURING COMMON STANDING YOGA POSES IN ORDER TO EXPLORE THE FEASIBILITY AND POSSIBLE INJURY RISK IN DEALING WITH MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS. ELEVEN YOGA INSTRUCTORS WERE RECRUITED TO EXECUTE FIVE YOGA POSES (CHAIR, TREE, WARRIOR 1, 2, AND 3). THE RESULTS REVEALED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN HIP, KNEE, AND ANKLE JMOFS AND VARYING DEGREES OF MUSCLE ACTIVATION AMONG THE POSES. AMONG THESE POSES, RECTUS FEMORIS MUSCLE ACTIVATION DURING THE CHAIR POSE WAS THE HIGHEST, WARRIOR 2 PRODUCED THE HIGHEST MUSCLE ACTIVATION IN THE VASTUS LATERALIS OF THE FRONT LIMB, WHILE WARRIOR 1 HAD THE HIGHEST MUSCLE ACTIVATION IN THE VASTUS MEDIALIS OF THE BACK LIMB. THEREFORE, ALL THREE POSES CAN POSSIBLY BE SUGGESTED AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION FOR QUADRICEPS STRENGTHENING. WARRIOR 1 WAS POSSIBLY SUGGESTED AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION IN ORDER TO REDUCE EXCESSIVE LATERAL OVERLOAD OF THE PATELLA, BUT THE POSSIBLE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF WARRIOR 2 WITH THE HIGHEST KNEE ADDUCTOR JMOF IN THE BACK LIMB COULD RAISE JOINT REACTION FORCES ACROSS THE MEDIAL CONDYLES. IN SINGLE-LEG BALANCE POSTURES, WARRIOR 3 HAD UNIQUE TRAINING EFFECTS ON THE HAMSTRING, AND IS THEREFORE SUGGESTED AS A PART OF HAMSTRING REHABILITATION EXERCISES. THE TREE POSE INDUCED LOW LOWER-EXTREMITY JMOFS AND A LOW LEVEL OF THIGH MUSCLE ACTIVATIONS WHEN IT WAS PERFORMED BY SENIOR INSTRUCTORS WITH EXCELLENT BALANCE CONTROL; HOWEVER, FOR YOGA BEGINNERS WITH INSUFFICIENT STABILITY, IT WILL BE A USEFUL TRAINING MODE FOR STRENGTHENING THE MUSCLES THAT HELP TO KEEP ONE UPRIGHT. THIS STUDY QUANTIFIED THE PHYSICAL DEMANDS OF YOGA POSES USING BIOMECHANICAL DATA AND ELUCIDATED THE STRUCTURES AND PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING EACH YOGA MOVEMENT. THIS IS CRUCIAL FOR YOGA PRACTITIONERS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                     
18   58  25 A COMPARISON OF EMG OUTPUT OF FOUR LOWER EXTREMITY MUSCLES DURING SELECTED YOGA POSTURES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO USE SURFACE ELECTROMYOGRAPHY (EMG) ANALYSIS TO EXAMINE THE MUSCLE ACTIVATION OF THE ANTERIOR TIBIALIS (TA), GASTROCNEMIUS (GA), RECTUS FEMORIS (RF) AND BICEPS FEMORIS (BF) MUSCLES DURING SEVERAL YOGA POSES: TREE POSE (VRKSASHANA), HALF MOON POSE (ARDHA CHANDRASANA) AND WARRIOR III (VIRABADRASANA) WHEN COMPARED TO A REST POSE (MOUNTAIN POSE). TEN HEALTHY FEMALES WITH MORE THAN 3 MONTHS OF CONTINUOUS YOGA EXPERIENCE WHO PRACTICED AT LEAST 1.5H PER WEEK WERE RECRUITED. EMG ACTIVITY WAS RECORDED FROM THE AFOREMENTIONED MUSCLES DURING MOUNTAIN POSE ("REST") FOR 30S, THREE TIMES. SUBJECTS THEN PERFORMED THE FOLLOWING YOGA POSES IN A RANDOMIZED SEQUENCE WHILE SURFACE EMG ACTIVITY WAS RECORDED: TREE POSE, HALF-MOON, AND WARRIOR III. EACH POSE WAS HELD FOR 20S TO 30S AND PERFORMED THREE TIMES. EMG DATA WERE BAND PASS FILTERED AND THE ROOT MEAN SQUARE (RMS) WAS OBTAINED. THE PEAK RMS OF EACH OF THE RESTING TRIALS WAS OBTAINED AND AVERAGED TO PRODUCE AN AVERAGE PEAK RESTING RMS VALUE. THE STUDY REVEALED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER EMG ACTIVITY IN TA AND GA IN ALL THREE POSES WHEN COMPARED TO BF AND RF. BF PRODUCED GREATER EMG ACTIVITY THAN RF IN WARRIOR III. IN CONCLUSION, SINGLE LIMB YOGA POSES REQUIRE INCREASED USE OF THE ANKLE MUSCULATURE WHEN COMPARED TO THIGH MUSCULATURE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
19 2522  31 YOGA DECREASES KYPHOSIS IN SENIOR WOMEN AND MEN WITH ADULT-ONSET HYPERKYPHOSIS: RESULTS OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS WHETHER A SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED YOGA INTERVENTION CAN REDUCE HYPERKYPHOSIS. DESIGN: A 6-MONTH, TWO-GROUP, RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED, SINGLE-MASKED TRIAL. SETTING: COMMUNITY RESEARCH UNIT. PARTICIPANTS: ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN WOMEN AND MEN AGED 60 AND OLDER WITH A KYPHOSIS ANGLE OF 40 DEGREES OR GREATER. MAJOR EXCLUSIONS WERE SERIOUS MEDICAL COMORBIDITY, USE OF ASSISTIVE DEVICE, INABILITY TO HEAR OR SEE ADEQUATELY FOR PARTICIPATION, AND INABILITY TO PASS A PHYSICAL SAFETY SCREEN. INTERVENTION: THE ACTIVE TREATMENT GROUP ATTENDED HOUR-LONG YOGA CLASSES 3 DAYS PER WEEK FOR 24 WEEKS. THE CONTROL GROUP ATTENDED A MONTHLY LUNCHEON AND SEMINAR AND RECEIVED MAILINGS. MEASUREMENTS: PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE CHANGE (BASELINE TO 6 MONTHS) IN DEBRUNNER KYPHOMETER-ASSESSED KYPHOSIS ANGLE, STANDING HEIGHT, TIMED CHAIR STANDS, FUNCTIONAL REACH, AND WALKING SPEED. SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE CHANGE IN KYPHOSIS INDEX, FLEXICURVE KYPHOSIS ANGLE, RANCHO BERNARDO BLOCKS POSTURE ASSESSMENT, AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL). RESULTS: COMPARED WITH CONTROL PARTICIPANTS, PARTICIPANTS RANDOMIZED TO YOGA EXPERIENCED A 4.4% IMPROVEMENT IN FLEXICURVE KYPHOSIS ANGLE (P=.006) AND A 5% IMPROVEMENT IN KYPHOSIS INDEX (P=.004). THE INTERVENTION DID NOT RESULT IN STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN DEBRUNNER KYPHOMETER ANGLE, MEASURED PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE, OR SELF-ASSESSED HRQOL (EACH P>.1). CONCLUSION: THE DECREASE IN FLEXICURVE KYPHOSIS ANGLE IN THE YOGA TREATMENT GROUP SHOWS THAT HYPERKYPHOSIS IS REMEDIABLE, A CRITICAL FIRST STEP IN THE PATHWAY TO TREATING OR PREVENTING THIS CONDITION. LARGER, MORE-DEFINITIVE STUDIES OF YOGA OR OTHER INTERVENTIONS FOR HYPERKYPHOSIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. TARGETING INDIVIDUALS WITH MORE-MALLEABLE SPINES AND USING LONGITUDINALLY PRECISE MEASURES OF KYPHOSIS COULD STRENGTHEN THE TREATMENT EFFECT.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
20 1757  27 POSITION OF THE HIP IN YOGA. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS GROWING IN POPULARITY AS A FORM OF EXERCISE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. ORTHOPEDIC PATIENTS PARTICIPATE IN YOGA, YET LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE RANGES-OF-MOTION OF THE HIP WITHIN VARIOUS YOGA POSES. ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS ARE UNSURE ABOUT WHAT POTENTIAL POSITIONS THEIR PATIENTS ARE PLACING THEIR HIPS DURING A YOGA PRACTICE. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO QUANTIFY THE DEGREE OF HIP MOTION WITH COMMON YOGA POSES. METHODS: TWENTY HEALTHY, REGULAR PRACTITIONERS OF YOGA PERFORMED 11 DIFFERENT YOGA POSES IN A STANDARDIZED FASHION. MOTION ANALYSIS WAS USED TO CAPTURE RANGE-OF-MOTION OF THE HIP DURING EACH POSE. RESULTS: MANY YOGA POSES PUT THE HIP IN EXTREMES OF MOTION. POSES SUCH AS DOWNWARD DOG, FORWARD FOLD, SEATED TWIST, AND PIGEON STRESSED THE HIP IN FLEXION. WARRIOR 1, WARRIOR 2, CRESCENT LUNGE, PIGEON, AND TRIANGLE STRESSED THE HIP IN EXTENSION. EAGLE AND SEATED TWIST PUT THE HIP IN HIGHER ADDUCTION, WHILE HALF MOON, EAGLE, AND TRIANGLE PRODUCED MORE HIP INTERNAL ROTATION. CONCLUSION: MANY POSES WERE FOUND TO REACH EXTREMES OF HIP MOTION. THIS STUDY MAY HELP GUIDE THE ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON IN COUNSELING HIP ARTHROPLASTY AND HIP IMPINGEMENT PATIENTS ABOUT YOGA-RELATED ACTIVITY. BY KNOWING WHICH POSES POTENTIALLY STRESS THE HIP IN PARTICULAR PLANES OF MOTION, SURGEONS MAY BETTER INFORM THEIR PATIENTS WHO ARE RETURNING TO YOGA AFTER INJURY OR SURGERY.	2018

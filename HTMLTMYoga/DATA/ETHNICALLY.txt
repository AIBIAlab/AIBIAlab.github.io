1 2739 147 YOGA PRACTICE AMONG ETHNICALLY/RACIALLY DIVERSE EMERGING ADULTS: ASSOCIATIONS WITH BODY IMAGE, MINDFUL AND DISORDERED EATING, AND MUSCLE-ENHANCING BEHAVIORS. BACKGROUND: THIS STUDY EXPLORES CROSS-SECTIONAL ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN YOGA AND BODY IMAGE, MINDFUL EATING, DISORDERED EATING, AND MUSCLE-ENHANCING BEHAVIORS AMONG A POPULATION-BASED SAMPLE OF ETHNICALLY/RACIALLY DIVERSE EMERGING ADULTS. METHOD: AN ETHNICALLY/RACIALLY DIVERSE POPULATION-BASED SAMPLE OF 1,568 EMERGING ADULTS (18-26 YEARS) COMPLETED SURVEYS AS PART OF EAT 2010-2018 (EATING AND ACTIVITY OVER TIME). MODELS WERE ADJUSTED FOR SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS AND BODY MASS INDEX (BMI). RESULTS: PRACTICING YOGA AT LEAST 30 MIN/WEEK WAS REPORTED BY 12.7% (N = 210) OF THE SAMPLE. YOGA PRACTITIONERS HAD HIGHER LEVELS OF MINDFUL EATING THAN THOSE NOT PRACTICING YOGA. ALTHOUGH EFFECT SIZES WERE SMALL, YOGA PRACTITIONERS WERE MORE LIKELY THAN NON-YOGA PRACTITIONERS TO USE STEROIDS (3.8 VS. 0.7%, P < .001, H = 0.22) OR PROTEIN POWDER/SHAKES (35.1 VS. 25.3%, P < .010, H = 0.21) TO INCREASE THEIR MUSCLE SIZE/TONE. BODY SATISFACTION, UNHEALTHY WEIGHT CONTROL BEHAVIORS, AND BINGE EATING TENDED TO BE SIMILAR AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND NON-YOGA PRACTITIONERS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION BETWEEN BMI AND YOGA IN PREDICTING BODY SATISFACTION WITH A TREND TOWARD A POSITIVE IMPACT AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS AT HIGHER BMI VALUES. INTERACTIONS BETWEEN YOGA PRACTICE AND ALL BODY IMAGE ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS ACROSS GENDER AND ETHNICITY/RACE WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. DISCUSSION: YOUNG PEOPLE FROM DIVERSE ETHNIC/RACIAL BACKGROUNDS WHO PRACTICE YOGA ARE MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN MINDFUL EATING BUT HAVE EQUAL OR ELEVATED LEVELS OF UNHEALTHY BODY IMAGE ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS AS COMPARED TO NON-YOGA PRACTITIONERS. FURTHER RESEARCH SHOULD EXPLORE HOW YOGA IS BEST TAUGHT AND PRACTICED TO ENSURE THAT IT IS BENEFICIAL FOR BODY IMAGE AND RELATED BEHAVIORS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
2 1219  60 EXPOSURE TO ADVERSE EVENTS AND ASSOCIATIONS WITH STRESS LEVELS AND THE PRACTICE OF YOGA: SURVEY FINDINGS FROM A POPULATION-BASED STUDY OF DIVERSE EMERGING YOUNG ADULTS. OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE PREVALENCE OF EXPOSURE TO ADVERSE EVENTS AND ASSOCIATIONS WITH STRESS LEVELS AMONG A DIVERSE POPULATION-BASED SAMPLE OF YOUNG PEOPLE. THE STUDY FURTHER EXPLORES WHETHER THESE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS, WHO HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BENEFIT FROM THE MIND-BODY PRACTICE OF YOGA, ENGAGE IN A REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE. DESIGN: EAT 2018 (EATING AND ACTIVITY OVER TIME) IS A POPULATION-BASED STUDY IN WHICH SURVEY DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM 1568 ETHNICALLY/RACIALLY DIVERSE (81.2% NONWHITE) EMERGING YOUNG ADULTS (MEAN AGE: 22.0 +/- 2.0 YEARS). RESULTS: EXPOSURE TO ADVERSE EVENTS WAS HIGHLY PREVALENT. FOR EXAMPLE, 43.9% REPORTED AT LEAST ONE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCE (ACE) (E.G., PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, OR SEXUAL ABUSE BEFORE AGE 18), WHEREAS 40.1% REPORTED EXPERIENCING DISCRIMINATION. EXPOSURE TO ADVERSE EVENTS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER STRESS LEVELS. PRACTICING YOGA AT LEAST 30 MIN/WEEK WAS REPORTED BY 12.7% OF THE POPULATION, WITH VARIATION ACROSS SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS. YOUNG ADULTS EXPOSED TO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE EITHER MORE OR SIMILARLY LIKELY TO PRACTICE YOGA THAN YOUNG ADULTS NOT REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS. CONCLUSIONS: THE HIGH PREVALENCE OF EXPOSURE TO ADVERSE EVENTS AND ASSOCIATIONS WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF STRESS POINTS TO A NEED FOR PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS. THUS, IT WAS PROMISING TO FIND THAT YOUNG PEOPLE EXPOSED TO ADVERSE EVENTS, WHO MAY HAVE GREATER EMOTIONAL BURDENS, PRACTICE YOGA AT EQUAL OR GREATER PROPORTIONS TO THOSE WITHOUT THESE EXPOSURES. GIVEN THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR POPULATIONS LIVING WITH HIGH STRESS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO DEVELOP FURTHER OUTREACH EFFORTS AND PROVIDE ACCESSIBLE, ACCEPTABLE, AND AFFORDABLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PRACTICING YOGA.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
3   17  28 "THE PAIN LEFT, I WAS OFF AND RUNNING": A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF GROUP ACUPUNCTURE AND YOGA THERAPY FOR CHRONIC PAIN IN A LOW-INCOME AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE POPULATION. INTRODUCTION: CHRONIC PAIN AND THE CURRENT OPIOID EPIDEMIC ARE PRESSING PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS, ESPECIALLY IN LOW-INCOME AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE COMMUNITIES. NONPHARMACOLOGIC THERAPIES THAT ARE SAFE, EFFECTIVE, AND ACCEPTABLE FOR THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC PAIN CONDITIONS MAY PROVIDE A SOLUTION FOR ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE. THIS QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS EXPLORES THE EXPERIENCE OF STUDY PARTICIPANTS WHO RECEIVED COMBINED ACUPUNCTURE AND YOGA THERAPY (YT) TO TREAT CHRONIC PAIN DELIVERED IN A PRIMARY CARE SETTING. METHODS: THE GROUP ACUPUNCTURE WITH YOGA THERAPY FOR CHRONIC NECK, LOW BACK, AND OSTEOARTHRITIC PAIN TRIAL (GAPYOGA) ASSESSED THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF GROUP ACUPUNCTURE (GA) COMBINED WITH YT IN A LOW-INCOME, RACIAL, AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE POPULATION. INDIVIDUAL IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH A SUBSET OF PATIENTS IN THE TRIAL. NINETEEN PARTICIPANTS WERE INTERVIEWED FOR QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF THEIR EXPERIENCE. USING THE IMMERSION AND CRYSTALLIZATION METHOD, TRANSCRIBED INTERVIEWS WERE ANALYZED FOR THEMES MEANINGFULLY REPRESENTING PARTICIPANT EXPERIENCE. RESULTS: THE COMBINED GA AND YT RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT PAIN RELIEF AND TRANSFORMATIVE HEALING EXPERIENCES. THREE THEMES EMERGED FROM PARTICIPANT NARRATIVES: (1) TRANSFORMATIVE ENGAGEMENT WITH SELF IN THE HEALING PROCESS THROUGH PAIN RELIEF, PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING, AND SELF-EFFICACY; (2) THERAPEUTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH ACUPUNCTURE AND YOGA PROVIDERS; AND (3) FOSTERING RELATIONSHIPS WITH FELLOW PARTICIPANTS IN THE GROUP. DISCUSSION: IN THIS STUDY OF A LOW-INCOME AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE POPULATION, THE COMBINATION OF ACUPUNCTURE AND YT WAS FOUND TO ALLEVIATE PAIN, IMPROVE FUNCTION, PROMOTE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING, AND ENGAGE PARTICIPANTS IN SELF-CARE PRACTICES IN A TRANSFORMATIVE HEALING PROCESS-RESULTING IN PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFITS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
4 2226  31 THE IMPACT OF YOGA IN MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS: A MIXED-METHODS STUDY. OBJECTIVES: WE EVALUATED THE ACCEPTABILITY, ACCESS, AND IMPACT OF YOGA AMONG PARTICIPANTS IN YOGA CLASSES CO-LOCATED IN COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS. DESIGN: PARTICIPANTS WERE INVITED TO COMPLETE A MIXED-METHODS PROGRAM EVALUATION CONSISTING OF A PRE/POST SURVEY AT THEIR FIRST CLASS AND STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS AT 4 MONTHS. SETTING: THE STUDY TOOK PLACE AT TWO COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO, IL, USA. INTERVENTIONS: FOUR WEEKLY 1-1.5 HOUR YOGA CLASSES WERE PROVIDED BY FOUR CERTIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTORS TRAINED TO TEACH TO ALL ABILITY LEVELS. MEASURES: OUR PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES WERE PAIN AND STRESS BEFORE AND AFTER THE FIRST CLASS, AND AT 4-MONTHS. WE GATHERED DATA ABOUT PARTICIPANT DEMOGRAPHICS, THEIR HEALTH PROBLEMS, HOW THEY ACCESSED THE CLASSES, AND MOTIVATIONS AND BARRIERS TO ATTENDING. WE ALSO EXTRACTED THEMES FROM PARTICIPANTS' QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES. RESULTS: OVERALL, 70 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE INITIAL SURVEYS; 44 COMPLETED THE 4-MONTH INTERVIEWS. A RACIALLY AND ETHNICALLY DIVERSE GROUP OF MIDDLE- AND LOW-INCOME ADULT PATIENTS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS ATTENDED, WITH FLYERS AND WORD OF MOUTH THE MAJOR ROUTES TO THE CLASS. A SINGLE YOGA CLASS PROVIDED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN PAIN AND STRESS, BUT THESE BENEFITS WERE NOT DEMONSTRATED AT THE 4-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. THE PRIMARY MOTIVATORS FOR YOGA CLASS ATTENDANCE WERE STRESS RELIEF, EXERCISE, AND OVERALL HEALTH IMPROVEMENT. PRIMARY BARRIERS INCLUDED FAMILY ISSUES, SCHEDULE, ILLNESS, AND WORK CONFLICTS. PRIMARY BENEFITS INCLUDED PHYSICAL BENEFITS, RELAXATION, EMOTIONAL BENEFITS, AND COMMUNITY CONNECTEDNESS. CONCLUSIONS: CO-LOCATING YOGA CLASSES IN COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS PROVIDES A VARIETY OF BENEFITS AND IS A VIABLE PATHWAY TO ADDRESSING DISPARITIES IN YOGA ACCESS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
5 1861  32 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF BIKRAM YOGA AND AEROBIC EXERCISE FOR DEPRESSION IN WOMEN: EFFICACY AND STRESS-BASED MECHANISMS. BACKGROUND: THE CURRENT STUDY PRESENTS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED 8-WEEK TRIAL OF BIKRAM YOGA, AEROBIC EXERCISE, AND WAITLIST FOR DEPRESSION. BIKRAM YOGA WAS CHOSEN SPECIFICALLY FOR ITS STANDARDIZED NATURE. FURTHER, WE EXAMINED CHANGES IN THREE STRESS-RELATED CONSTRUCTS-PERCEIVED STRESS, RUMINATION, AND MINDFULNESS-AS MEDIATORS OF ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFECTS. METHOD: FIFTY-THREE WOMEN (AGE 18-65; 74% WHITE) WITH A UNIPOLAR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THE THREE CONDITIONS. RESPONSE WAS DEFINED AS >50% REDUCTION ON THE HAMILTON RATING SCALE FOR DEPRESSION (HAM-D). REMISSION WAS DEFINED AS NO LONGER MEETING CRITERIA FOR DEPRESSION AND A HAM-D </= 7. SELF-REPORTED PERCEIVED STRESS, RUMINATION, AND MINDFULNESS WERE ASSESSED WEEKLY. RESULTS: IN THE INTENTION-TO-TREAT SAMPLE (N = 53), RESPONSE RATES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN THE BIKRAM YOGA (61.1%; CHI(2) = 10.48, P = .001) AND AEROBIC EXERCISE (60.0%; CHI(2) = 10.44, P = .001) CONDITIONS RELATIVE TO WAITLIST (6.7%). IN THE COMPLETER SAMPLE (N = 42), 73.3% (CHI(2) = 11.41, P = .001) OF WOMEN IN YOGA AND 80.0% (CHI(2) = 13.72, P < .001) IN EXERCISE ACHIEVED RESPONSE COMPARED TO 8.3% IN WAITLIST. REDUCTIONS IN RUMINATION SIGNIFICANTLY MEDIATED HAM-D CHANGE FOR BOTH ACTIVE TREATMENTS, AND MINDFUL ACCEPTANCE WAS A PARTIAL MEDIATOR IN THE EXERCISE CONDITION. LIMITATIONS: THE SAMPLE WAS SMALL IN SIZE, CONSISTED OF WOMEN ONLY, AND WAS ETHNICALLY HOMOGENOUS. INTER-RATER RELIABILITY WAS NOT ASSESSED, AEROBIC EXERCISE WAS NOT STANDARDIZED, AND MEDIATORS WERE ASSESSED BY SELF-REPORT. CONCLUSIONS: BIKRAM YOGA SHOWED DESCRIPTIVELY SIMILAR EFFICACY TO AEROBIC EXERCISE AND BOTH MAY WORK, IN PART, BY HELPING INDIVIDUALS INTERRUPT NEGATIVE THINKING.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
6  144  37 A QUALITATIVE APPROACH EXPLORING THE ACCEPTABILITY OF YOGA FOR MINORITIES LIVING WITH ARTHRITIS: 'WHERE ARE THE PEOPLE WHO LOOK LIKE ME?' OBJECTIVES: TO EXAMINE THE ACCEPTABILITY OF YOGA RESEARCH TAILORED TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN A MINORITY POPULATION (BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH SPEAKING) WITH ARTHRITIS. YOGA RESEARCH FOR ARTHRITIS OFTEN UNDERREPRESENTS MINORITIES AND ACCEPTABILITY FOR THIS POPULATION HAS NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN INVESTIGATED. DESIGN: ACCEPTABILITY WAS EVALUATED USING RETENTION, ADHERENCE, JOURNALS, AND SEMI-STRUCTURED EXIT INTERVIEWS FROM TWELVE PARTICIPANTS WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS OR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS UNDERGOING AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. JOURNAL QUOTES WERE ANALYZED USING CONTENT ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES. NVIVO SOFTWARE WAS USED TO ORGANIZE TRANSCRIPTS AND ASSEMBLE THEMES. TWO METHODS OF TRIANGULATION (DATA AND INVESTIGATOR) WERE USED TO OVERCOME POTENTIAL BIAS FROM A SINGLE-PERSPECTIVE INTERPRETATION. EXIT INTERVIEW COMMENTS WERE CONTENT ANALYZED USING A CARD SORT METHOD. THE STUDY WAS DESIGNED WITH A CULTURAL INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING A MULTICULTURAL RESEARCH TEAM, TRANSLATORS, AND BILINGUAL MATERIALS AND CLASSES, TO FACILITATE TRUST AND ACCEPTABILITY FOR PRIMARILY HISPANIC AND BLACK/AFRICAN-AMERICAN ADULTS. SETTING: WASHINGTON, D.C. METROPOLITAN AREA, USA. RESULTS: ON AVERAGE PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED 10 OF 16 CLASSES, WITH HOME PRACTICE 2-3DAYS A WEEK. ALL WHO COMPLETED WERE STILL PRACTICING YOGA THREE-MONTHS LATER. QUALITATIVE NARRATIVE ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED MAJOR THEMES RELATED TO FACILITATING FACTORS AND BARRIERS FOR YOGA PRACTICE, SELF-EFFICACY, AND SUPPORT. PARTICIPANT COMMENTS INDICATED THAT OFFERING AN ARTHRITIS-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION AND USING A CULTURALLY CONGRUENT RESEARCH DESIGN WAS FOUND TO BE ACCEPTABLE. CONCLUSIONS: AS YOGA RESEARCH GROWS, THERE IS A NEED TO UNDERSTAND AND PROMOTE ACCEPTABILITY FOR TYPICALLY UNDER-REPRESENTED POPULATIONS. THIS STUDY ATTEMPTS TO INFORM THE EXPANSION OF MULTICULTURAL RESEARCH DESIGNED TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN THOSE FROM DIVERSE BACKGROUNDS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
7  151  31 A QUALITATIVE INVESTIGATION TO INFORM YOGA INTERVENTION RECRUITMENT PRACTICES FOR RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY ADOLESCENTS IN OUTPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. OBJECTIVE: YOGA IS RECOGNIZED AS AN EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO IMPROVING OVERALL PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH; HOWEVER, THERE MAY BE PERCEIVED BARRIERS TO YOGA PARTICIPATION, PARTICULARLY AMONG POPULATIONS MOST AT RISK FOR MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. WE CONDUCTED QUALITATIVE FORMATIVE RESEARCH TO HELP INFORM RECRUITMENT PRACTICES FOR A FUTURE STUDY AND TO SPECIFICALLY UNDERSTAND THE BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO ENGAGEMENT IN YOGA PRACTICE AMONG RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY ADOLESCENTS, AS WELL AS ADOLESCENTS IN OUTPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT. METHODS: QUALITATIVE DATA WERE COLLECTED AT A COMMUNITY HEALTH CLINIC THAT SERVES LOW INCOME FAMILIES IN SOUTHEASTERN FLORIDA. USING SEMI STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITY ADOLESCENTS BETWEEN 12 AND 17 YEARS OLD, PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED ABOUT BELIEFS AND PERCEPTIONS ABOUT YOGA, AS WELL AS RECOMMENDATIONS ON RECRUITING PEERS. A THEMATIC ANALYSIS APPROACH WAS USED TO IDENTIFY AND EXAMINE COMMON THEMES. RESULTS: TWENTY INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED AND EIGHT MAJOR THEMES EMERGED FROM THE DATA. THEMES WERE GROUPED AS (1) FACILITATORS TO RECRUITMENT AND (2) BARRIERS TO RECRUITMENT. INTERPRETATION: ADVERTISING FREE YOGA THAT EMPHASIZES THE SOCIAL, PHYSICAL, AND MENTAL BENEFITS CAN HELP ASSUAGE NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OF YOGA AND PROMOTE THE ADVANTAGES OF YOGA AMONG TEENAGERS. HAVING RECRUITMENT MATERIALS AND MODALITIES THAT HIGHLIGHT INCLUSIVITY OF ALL GENDERS AND PHYSICAL ABILITIES IN THE YOGA CLASSES ARE ALSO IMPORTANT IN FACILITATING PARTICIPATION. UNDERSTANDING PERCEPTIONS OF YOGA, AS WELL AS PERCEIVED BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS, AMONG RACIALLY/ETHNICALLY DIVERSE ADOLESCENTS IN OUTPATIENT MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT, CAN ASSIST RECRUITMENT EFFORTS, INCREASE YOGA INTERVENTION PARTICIPATION, AND ULTIMATELY, IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
8 1155  28 ENHANCING YOGA PARTICIPATION: A QUALITATIVE INVESTIGATION OF BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO YOGA AMONG PREDOMINANTLY RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITY, LOW-INCOME ADULTS. YOGA IS UNDERUTILIZED AMONG RACIAL/ETHNIC MINORITIES AND LOW-INCOME POPULATIONS. TO ENHANCE PARTICIPATION AMONG THESE DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS AND TO INFORM A FUTURE CLINICAL TRIAL, WE CONDUCTED A QUALITATIVE FORMATIVE INVESTIGATION, INFORMED BY THE SOCIAL CONTEXTUAL MODEL OF HEALTH BEHAVIOR CHANGE, TO IDENTIFY BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO YOGA THAT COULD IMPACT STUDY PARTICIPATION. WE RECRUITED TWENTY-FOUR RACIALLY/ETHNICALLY DIVERSE ADULTS, WITH AND WITHOUT PRIOR YOGA EXPERIENCE, FROM A LOW-INCOME, URBAN HOUSING COMMUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN EITHER AN INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEW OR FOCUS GROUP. A THEMATIC DATA ANALYSIS APPROACH WAS EMPLOYED. BARRIERS TO YOGA ENGAGEMENT INCLUDED THE PERCEPTION THAT YOGA LACKS PHYSICALITY AND WEIGHT LOSS BENEFITS, FEAR OF INJURY, LACK OF ABILITY/SELF-EFFICACY TO PERFORM THE PRACTICES, PREFERENCE FOR OTHER PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES, AND SCHEDULING DIFFICULTIES. FACILITATORS OF YOGA ENGAGEMENT INCLUDED A QUALITY YOGA INSTRUCTOR WHO PROVIDES INDIVIDUALIZED INSTRUCTION, BEGINNER LEVEL CLASSES, AND PROMOTIONAL MESSAGING THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA, SUCH AS STRESS REDUCTION.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
9 1224  37 FEASIBILITY AND ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME MEASURES FOR YOGA AS SELF-CARE FOR MINORITIES WITH ARTHRITIS: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: WHILE THERE IS A GROWING INTEREST IN THE THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS OF YOGA, MINORITY POPULATIONS WITH ARTHRITIS TEND TO BE UNDER-REPRESENTED IN THE RESEARCH. ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS AN ABSENCE OF GUIDANCE IN THE LITERATURE REGARDING THE USE OF MULTICULTURAL TEAMS AND SOCIOCULTURAL HEALTH BELIEFS, WHEN DESIGNING YOGA STUDIES FOR A RACIALLY DIVERSE POPULATION WITH ARTHRITIS. THIS PILOT STUDY EXAMINED THE FEASIBILITY OF OFFERING YOGA AS A SELF-CARE MODALITY TO AN URBAN, BILINGUAL, MINORITY POPULATION WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) OR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA), IN THE WASHINGTON, DC AREA. METHODS: THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF OFFERING AN 8-WEEK, BILINGUAL YOGA INTERVENTION ADAPTED FOR ARTHRITIS TO A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF PRIMARILY HISPANIC AND BLACK/AFRICAN-AMERICAN ADULTS. A RACIALLY DIVERSE INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH TEAM WAS ASSEMBLED TO DESIGN A STUDY TO FACILITATE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION. THE SECOND OBJECTIVE IDENTIFIED OUTCOME MEASURES TO OPERATIONALIZE POTENTIAL FACILITATORS AND BARRIERS TO SELF-CARE AND SELF-EFFICACY. THE THIRD OBJECTIVE DETERMINED THE FEASIBILITY OF USING COMPUTER-ASSISTED SELF-INTERVIEW (CASI) FOR DATA COLLECTION. RESULTS: ENROLLED PARTICIPANTS (N = 30) WERE MOSTLY FEMALE (93%), SPANISH SPEAKING (69%), AND DIAGNOSED WITH RA (88.5%). FEASIBILITY WAS EVALUATED USING PRACTICALITY, ACCEPTABILITY, ADAPTATION, AND EXPANSION OF AN ARTHRITIS-ADAPTED YOGA INTERVENTION, MODIFIED FOR THIS POPULATION. RECRUITMENT (51%) AND PARTICIPATION (60%) RATES WERE SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS RESEARCH AND CLINICAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE STUDY POPULATION. OF THOSE ENROLLED, 18 STARTED THE INTERVENTION. FOR ADHERENCE, 12 OUT OF 18 (67%) PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE INTERVENTION. ALL (100%), WHO COMPLETED THE INTERVENTION, CONTINUED TO PRACTICE YOGA 3 MONTHS AFTER COMPLETING THE STUDY. USING NONPARAMETRIC TESTS, SELECTED OUTCOME MEASURES SHOWED A MEASURABLE CHANGE POST-INTERVENTION SUGGESTING APPROPRIATE USE IN FUTURE STUDIES. AN IN-PERSON COMPUTERIZED QUESTIONNAIRE WAS DETERMINED TO BE A FEASIBLE METHOD OF DATA COLLECTION. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS FROM THIS PILOT STUDY CONFIRM THE FEASIBILITY OF OFFERING YOGA TO THIS RACIALLY/ETHNICALLY DIVERSE POPULATION WITH ARTHRITIS. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES RECRUITMENT/RETENTION RATES, OUTCOME MEASURES WITH ERROR RATES, AND DATA COLLECTION RECOMMENDATIONS FOR A PREVIOUSLY UNDER-REPRESENTED POPULATION. SUGGESTIONS INCLUDE ALLOCATING RESOURCES FOR TRANSLATION AND USING A MULTICULTURAL DESIGN TO FACILITATE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION. TRIAL REGISTRATION: CLINICALTRIALS.GOV, NCT01617421.	2018	
  
10 2370  53 WHAT BRINGS YOUNG ADULTS TO THE YOGA MAT? CROSS-SECTIONAL ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AND PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH AMONG PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROJECT EAT-IV SURVEY. OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY EXAMINES MOTIVATIONS FOR YOGA AND IDENTIFIES UNIQUE MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AMONG A SAMPLE OF YOUNG ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS. THIS STUDY FURTHER DETERMINES HOW YOUNG ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS' MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES ASSOCIATE WITH PHYSICAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS. SUBJECTS/SETTING: SURVEY DATA WERE DRAWN FROM THE FOURTH WAVE OF A LARGE, POPULATION-BASED STUDY (PROJECT EAT-IV; EATING AND ACTIVITY IN TEENS AND YOUNG ADULTS). DESIGN: LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS (LCA) WAS USED TO IDENTIFY MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AMONG PROJECT EAT-IV PARTICIPANTS PRACTICING YOGA (N = 297; MEAN AGE: 30.8-1.7 YEARS; 79.7 % FEMALE). CROSS-SECTIONAL ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN LATENT MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES, PHYSICAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS WERE DETERMINED WITH UNADJUSTED AND ADJUSTED (GENDER, RACE/ETHNICITY, AND BODY MASS INDEX) GENERAL LINEAR MODELS. RESULTS: ACROSS MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES, MOST YOUNG ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS WERE MOTIVATED BY ENHANCED FITNESS AND STRESS REDUCTION/RELAXATION. ADDITIONAL MOTIVATIONS FOR YOGA CLUSTERED BY APPEARANCE (DESIRE TO CHANGE BODY APPEARANCE OR WEIGHT) OR MINDFULNESS (DESIRE TO INCREASE PRESENT MOMENT AWARENESS) UNDERPINNINGS. THE LCA CHARACTERIZED MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AS "LOW APPEARANCE, LOW MINDFULNESS" (CLASS 1; N = 77), "LOW APPEARANCE, HIGH MINDFULNESS" (CLASS 2; N = 48), "HIGH APPEARANCE, LOW MINDFULNESS" (CLASS 3; N = 79), AND "HIGH APPEARANCE, HIGH MINDFULNESS" (CLASS 4; N = 93). HAVING A PROFILE WITH HIGH MINDFULNESS AND LOW APPEARANCE MOTIVATIONS (CLASS 2) WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER BODY SATISFACTION IN COMPARISON TO THE OTHER CLASSES (P < 0.001). RELATIVE TO CLASS 2, THOSE WITH LOW MINDFULNESS MOTIVATIONS (CLASS 1; CLASS 3) REPORTED LESS TOTAL PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (P = 0.002) AND THOSE WITH HIGH APPEARANCE MOTIVATIONS (CLASS 3; CLASS 4) REPORTED HIGHER COMPULSIVE EXERCISE SCORES (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: IN THIS SAMPLE, HIGH MINDFULNESS AND LOW APPEARANCE MOTIVATIONS FOR YOGA APPEARED OPTIMAL FOR PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH. CROSS-SECTIONAL FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOUNG ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS' MIND-BODY HEALTH MAY BE SUPPORTED BY MOTIVATIONAL UNDERPINNINGS THAT EMPHASIZE YOGA'S INTERNAL (MINDFULNESS) RATHER THAN EXTERNAL (APPEARANCE) BENEFITS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
11   20  32 "WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER": A QUALITATIVE STUDY OF PREDOMINANTLY LOW INCOME MINORITY PARTICIPANTS IN A YOGA TRIAL FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. OBJECTIVE: TO EXPLORE THE EXPERIENCES OF LOW-INCOME MINORITY ADULTS TAKING PART IN A YOGA DOSING TRIAL FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. DESIGN: INDIVIDUAL SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH NINETEEN PARTICIPANTS RECRUITED FROM A RANDOMIZED YOGA DOSING TRIAL FOR PREDOMINANTLY LOW-INCOME MINORITY ADULTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. INTERVIEWS DISCUSSED THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON LOW BACK PAIN AND EMOTIONS; OTHER PERCEIVED ADVANTAGES OR DISADVANTAGES OF THE INTERVENTION; AND FACILITATORS AND BARRIERS TO PRACTICING YOGA. INTERVIEWS WERE AUDIO TAPED AND TRANSCRIBED, CODED USING ATLAS.TI SOFTWARE, AND ANALYZED WITH INDUCTIVE AND DEDUCTIVE THEMATIC ANALYSIS METHODS. SETTING: BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER, BOSTON, MA, USA. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS VIEWED YOGA AS A MEANS OF PAIN RELIEF AND ATTRIBUTED IMPROVED MOOD, GREATER ABILITY TO MANAGE STRESS, AND ENHANCED RELAXATION TO YOGA. OVERALL, PARTICIPANTS FELT EMPOWERED TO SELF-MANAGE THEIR PAIN. SOME FOUND YOGA TO BE HELPFUL IN BEING MINDFUL OF THEIR EMOTIONS AND ACCEPTING OF THEIR PAIN. TRUST IN THE YOGA INSTRUCTORS WAS A COMMONLY CITED FACILITATOR FOR YOGA CLASS ATTENDANCE. LACK OF TIME, MOTIVATION, AND FEAR OF INJURY WERE REPORTED BARRIERS TO YOGA PRACTICE. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA IS A MULTIDIMENSIONAL TREATMENT FOR LOW BACK PAIN THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO FAVORABLY IMPACT HEALTH IN A PREDOMINANTLY LOW-INCOME MINORITY POPULATION.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
12 1253  34 FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY AND PRELIMINARY IMPACT OF MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA AMONG HISPANIC/LATINX ADOLESCENTS. BACKGROUND: THE HISPANIC/LATINX POPULATION CONSTITUTES THE FASTEST GROWING ETHNIC/RACIAL MINORITY GROUP IN THE UNITED STATES (U.S.). COMPARED TO THEIR NON-HISPANIC/LATINX WHITE COUNTERPARTS, HISPANIC/LATINX YOUTH EXPERIENCE MORE DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, AND HAVE MORE UNMET MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS (88% VS 76%). EMERGING RESEARCH SUPPORTS THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL BENEFITS OF MIND-BODY AWARENESS TRAINING TO ENHANCE WELL-BEING AND MENTAL HEALTH, BUT ALMOST NO STUDIES HAVE RECRUITED ETHNIC/RACIAL MINORITY SAMPLES. PURPOSE: THE CURRENT STUDY EXAMINED THE FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY AND PRELIMINARY IMPACT OF A MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA PROGRAM AMONG HISPANIC/LATINX PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. PROCEDURES: PARTICIPANTS (N = 187) WERE RECRUITED FROM A LOCAL PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL IN A LARGE MULTI-ETHNIC URBAN SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE SOUTHEAST U.S. AND PARTICIPATED IN 6 WEEKLY HOUR-LONG SESSIONS OF MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED ASSESSMENTS AT PRETEST AND ONE MONTH AFTER PROGRAM COMPLETION. MAIN FINDINGS: THE SAMPLE WAS PREDOMINANTLY HISPANIC/LATINX (95%) AND FEMALE (64%), ON AVERAGE 15.2 YEARS OLD (SD = 1.3), AND 51% WERE BORN OUTSIDE THE U.S. PARTICIPANTS REPORTED ON AVERAGE A 14.2% REDUCTION IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (PRETEST MEAN = 5.51, POSTTEST MEAN = 4.73, P = .032, COHEN'S D = 0.2), A 14.9% REDUCTION IN ANXIETY SYMPTOMS (PRETEST MEAN = 9.90, POSTTEST MEAN = 8.42, P = .005, COHEN'S D = 0.2), AND A 21.9% REDUCTION IN STRESS (PRETEST MEAN = 9.66, POSTTEST MEAN = 7.54, P < .001, COHEN'S D = 0.5). CONCLUSION: THESE FINDINGS PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA PROGRAM FOR HISPANIC/LATINX ADOLESCENTS, A MEDICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED GROUP EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT MENTAL HEALTH DISPARITIES.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
13 1492  43 INTERNALIZED WEIGHT STIGMA AND INTUITIVE EATING AMONG STRESSED ADULTS DURING A MINDFUL YOGA INTERVENTION: ASSOCIATIONS WITH CHANGES IN MINDFULNESS AND SELF-COMPASSION. PURPOSE: INTERNALIZED WEIGHT STIGMA (IWS) IS COMMON IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ACROSS BODY WEIGHT CATEGORIES, AND IS IMPLICATED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DISTRESS AND UNHEALTHY EATING BEHAVIORS (E.G. OVEREATING, DISORDERED EATING) THAT CAN FOSTER POOR CARDIOMETABOLIC HEALTH. WHILE EMERGING INTERVENTION RESEARCH SHOWS EARLY PROMISE IN REDUCING IWS, LONG-TERM EFFICACY IS UNCLEAR AND NOVEL STRATEGIES REMAIN NEEDED. THIS ANALYSIS EXAMINED WHETHER PARTICIPATION IN A MINDFUL YOGA INTERVENTION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED IWS AND INCREASED INTUITIVE EATING, AN ADAPTIVE EATING BEHAVIOR, AND WHETHER THESE CHANGES CORRELATED WITH EACH OTHER OR WITH CHANGES IN MINDFULNESS AND SELF-COMPASSION. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE STRESSED ADULTS WITH LOW FRUIT AND VEGETABLE INTAKE (N = 78, 64.1% WHITE, M. BODY MASS INDEX 25.59 +/- 4.45) ENROLLED IN A PARENT CLINICAL TRIAL OF A 12-WEEK MINDFUL YOGA INTERVENTION. VALIDATED SELF-REPORT MEASURES OF IWS, INTUITIVE EATING, MINDFULNESS, AND SELF-COMPASSION WERE ADMINISTERED AT PRE-TREATMENT, MID-TREATMENT (8 WEEKS), POST-TREATMENT (12 WEEKS), AND 4-MONTH FOLLOW-UP (24 WEEKS). RESULTS: LINEAR MIXED MODELING REVEALED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN IWS AND INTUITIVE EATING ACROSS THE FOUR TIMEPOINTS (P < .001). REDUCED IWS CORRELATED WITH INCREASED INTUITIVE EATING PRE- TO POST-TREATMENT (P = .01). IMPROVED SELF-COMPASSION AND MINDFULNESS CORRELATED WITH INTUITIVE EATING (BOTH P = . 04), BUT NOT IWS (P = .74 AND P = .56, RESPECTIVELY). CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY OFFERS PRELIMINARY SUPPORT FOR THE HYPOTHESIS THAT MINDFUL YOGA MAY PROMOTE INTUITIVE EATING AND REDUCE IWS AMONG STRESSED ADULTS WITH POOR DIET, AND SUGGESTS THAT CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS MAY CO-OCCUR OVER TIME. FURTHER INVESTIGATION WITH CONTROLLED DESIGNS IS NECESSARY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE TEMPORALITY AND CAUSALITY OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS.TRIAL REGISTRATION: CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT02098018.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
14 1150  38 ENHANCING ACCESS TO YOGA FOR OLDER MALE VETERANS AFTER CANCER: EXAMINING BELIEFS ABOUT YOGA. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE CLINICAL INTERVENTION FOR CANCER SURVIVORS. MOST STUDIES OF THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CANCER PATIENTS REPORT ON PREDOMINANTLY MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER. LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT THE USE OF YOGA IN OLDER ADULTS, VETERANS, AND THOSE FROM DIVERSE RACIAL OR ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS. METHODS: WE EXAMINED STRATEGIES TO ENHANCE ACCESS TO YOGA IN OLDER VETERANS AFTER CANCER, FOCUSING ON EDUCATION (STUDY 1) AND INTERVENTION (STUDY 2). STUDY 1 INCLUDED 110 PARTICIPANTS WITH A MEDIAN (SD) AGE OF 64.9 (9.4) YEARS WHO WERE MOSTLY MALE (99%) CANCER SURVIVORS WHO WERE INTERVIEWED 12 MONTHS AFTER THEIR CANCER DIAGNOSIS. STUDY 2 INCLUDED 28 PARTICIPANTS WITH A MEDIAN (SD) AGE OF 69.2 (10.9) YEARS WHO WERE MOSTLY MALE (96%) CANCER SURVIVORS WHO PARTICIPATED IN A YOGA PROGRAM WITHIN 3 YEARS OF THEIR CANCER DIAGNOSIS. STANDARDIZED INTERVIEWS ASSESSED INTEREST IN AND BARRIERS TO YOGA WHILE SELF-REPORTING ASSESSED HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE AND BELIEFS ABOUT YOGA. RESULTS: IN STUDY 1, INTEREST IN YOGA INCREASED FROM 5.5 TO 31.8% (CHI (2) = 22.25, P < .001) FOLLOWING EDUCATION. IN OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS 4 THEMES RELATED TO NEGATIVE BELIEFS OR BARRIERS EMERGED: LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OR SKEPTICISM, DISINTEREST OR DISLIKE, PHYSICAL HEALTH BARRIERS, AND LOGISTICAL BARRIERS. IN STUDY 2, BELIEFS WERE MORE POSITIVE FOLLOWING INTERVENTION FOR EXPECTED BENEFITS (T = 4.44, P < .001), DISCOMFORT (T = 4.92, P < .001), AND SOCIAL NORMS (T = 4.38, P < .001) RELATED TO YOGA. PHYSICAL FUNCTION IMPROVED AFTER PARTICIPATION IN A YOGA CLASS, ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WITH HIGHER BELIEFS IN YOGA PRIOR TO CLASS. AGE WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH BELIEFS ABOUT YOGA IN EITHER SAMPLE. CONCLUSIONS: A PORTION OF OLDER VETERANS WHO ARE CANCER SURVIVORS WERE INTERESTED IN YOGA BUT FACED ACCESS BARRIERS. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND RESEARCH INCLUDE INCREASING KNOWLEDGE ABOUT YOGA BENEFITS AND ADDRESSING PHYSICAL HEALTH AND LOGISTICAL BARRIERS TO ENHANCE ACCESS TO YOGA FOR OLDER VETERANS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
15 1946  16 SATISFACTION WITH ONLINE VERSUS IN-PERSON YOGA DURING COVID-19. INTRODUCTION: DURING COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS, YOGA CLASSES TRANSITIONED TO ONLINE DELIVERY. THIS REPORT COMPARES THE PERCEIVED BENEFITS AND BARRIERS TO ONLINE AND IN-PERSON YOGA AND DETERMINE THE PREFERRED FORMAT. A SECONDARY AIM WAS TO COMPARE HOW WELL EACH FORMAT WAS PERCEIVED TO PRODUCE COMMON BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL ONLINE SURVEY OF AUSTRALIAN PARTICIPANTS. RESULTS: IN-PERSON YOGA SCORED HIGHEST FOR PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH/MOOD BENEFITS, PHYSICAL SATISFACTION, AND FEELING ENERGIZED. ONLINE YOGA SCORED HIGHEST FOR CONVENIENCE, MENTAL HEALTH/MOOD BENEFITS, AND AFFORDABILITY (INITIAL N = 156; FOLLOW-UP N = 55). CONCLUSION: ONLINE YOGA WAS ACCEPTABLE AND PERCEIVED TO PROVIDE IMPROVED MENTAL HEALTH AND MOOD.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
16 2034  29 TEENS' PERSPECTIVES ON YOGA AS A TREATMENT FOR STRESS AND DEPRESSION. OBJECTIVE: TO UNDERSTAND ADOLESCENTS' EXPERIENCES AND ATTITUDES TOWARD YOGA, WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR DEPRESSED ADOLESCENTS. DESIGN: QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM THREE FOCUS GROUPS AND EIGHT INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS, FOR A TOTAL OF 22 TEEN PARTICIPANTS. SETTING: OUTPATIENT SETTING IN A PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL IN THE U.S. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: TEENS WERE ASKED ABOUT THEIR OWN AND THEIR PEERS' ATTITUDES TOWARD, AND EXPERIENCES WITH, HATHA YOGA; REACTIONS TO A STUDY-CREATED YOGA VIDEO; AND OPINIONS ON CLASS LOGISTICS. RESULTS: TEENS HAD BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ATTITUDES TOWARD, AND EXPERIENCES WITH, HATHA YOGA. THEY COMMENTED ON "WHO DOES YOGA;" MANY RESPONSES SUGGESTED A LIMITED GROUP (E.G., MOMS; PEOPLE WITH MONEY AND TIME). PARTICIPANTS AGREED THAT YOGA COULD BE POTENTIALLY BENEFICIAL FOR DEPRESSED OR STRESSED TEENS. SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS WHILE BEING IN A YOGA CLASS WAS A MAJOR CONCERN. OVERALL, TEENS REACTED FAVORABLY TO THE STUDY-CREATED YOGA VIDEO. TEENS HAD VARIED OPINIONS ABOUT CLASS LOGISTICS INCLUDING CLASS DURATION AND SIZE. TEENS CITED BARRIERS TO CLASS, SUCH AS TRANSPORTATION, AS WELL AS BARRIERS TO HOME YOGA PRACTICE. CONCLUSIONS: KEY POINTS FOR DEVELOPING A YOGA CLASS THAT MIGHT BE APPEALING TO DEPRESSED OR STRESSED TEENS INCLUDE: CREATING A CLASS WITH VARIETY THAT TEENS WILL FIND INTERESTING; TAKING CONCRETE STEPS TO DECREASE TEEN SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS; INCORPORATING MESSAGES RELEVANT FOR TEENS AND CONSISTENT WITH YOGA PHILOSOPHY; AND ACTIVELY COUNTERING STEREOTYPES ABOUT WHO PRACTICES YOGA. LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY INCLUDE THE LACK OF DATA FROM MALE TEENS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
17  122  41 A PILOT STUDY OF YOGA AS SELF-CARE FOR ARTHRITIS IN MINORITY COMMUNITIES. BACKGROUND: WHILE ARTHRITIS IS THE MOST COMMON CAUSE OF DISABILITY, NON-HISPANIC BLACKS AND HISPANICS EXPERIENCE WORSE ARTHRITIS IMPACT DESPITE HAVING THE SAME OR LOWER PREVALENCE OF ARTHRITIS COMPARED TO NON-HISPANIC WHITES. PEOPLE WITH ARTHRITIS WHO EXERCISE REGULARLY HAVE LESS PAIN, MORE ENERGY, AND IMPROVED SLEEP, YET ARTHRITIS IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS FOR LIMITING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS YOGA, THAT TEACH STRESS MANAGEMENT ALONG WITH PHYSICAL ACTIVITY MAY BE WELL SUITED FOR INVESTIGATION IN BOTH OSTEOARTHRITIS AND RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. YOGA USERS ARE PREDOMINANTLY WHITE, FEMALE, AND COLLEGE EDUCATED. THERE ARE FEW STUDIES THAT EXAMINE YOGA IN MINORITY POPULATIONS; NONE ADDRESS ARTHRITIS. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A STUDY PROTOCOL EXAMINING THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF PROVIDING YOGA TO AN URBAN, MINORITY POPULATION WITH ARTHRITIS. METHODS/DESIGN: IN THIS ONGOING PILOT STUDY, A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF 20 MINORITY ADULTS DIAGNOSED WITH EITHER OSTEOARTHRITIS OR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS UNDERGO AN 8-WEEK PROGRAM OF YOGA CLASSES. IT IS BELIEVED THAT BY ATTENDING YOGA CLASSES DESIGNED FOR PATIENTS WITH ARTHRITIS, WITH RACIALLY CONCORDANT INSTRUCTORS; ACCEPTABILITY OF YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT TO STANDARD ARTHRITIS TREATMENT AND SELF-CARE WILL BE ENHANCED. SELF-CARE IS DEFINED AS ADOPTING BEHAVIORS THAT IMPROVE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WELL-BEING. THIS CONCEPT IS QUANTIFIED THROUGH COLLECTING PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOME MEASURES RELATED TO SPIRITUAL GROWTH, HEALTH RESPONSIBILITY, INTERPERSONAL RELATIONS, AND STRESS MANAGEMENT. ADDITIONAL MEASURES COLLECTED DURING THIS STUDY INCLUDE: PHYSICAL FUNCTION, ANXIETY/DEPRESSION, FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, SOCIAL ROLES, AND PAIN; AS WELL AS BASELINE DEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL DATA. FIELD NOTES, QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA REGARDING FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY ARE ALSO COLLECTED. ACCEPTABILITY IS DETERMINED BY RESPONSE/RETENTION RATES, POSITIVE QUALITATIVE DATA, AND CONTINUING YOGA PRACTICE AFTER THREE MONTHS. DISCUSSION: THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES IN RECRUITING AND RETAINING PARTICIPANTS FROM A COMMUNITY CLINIC SERVING MINORITY POPULATIONS. ADOPTING BEHAVIORS THAT IMPROVE WELL-BEING AND QUALITY OF LIFE INCLUDE THOSE THAT INTEGRATE MENTAL HEALTH (MIND) AND PHYSICAL HEALTH (BODY). FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED OFFERING INTEGRATIVE MODALITIES TO THIS POPULATION. THIS PILOT WAS UNDERTAKEN TO QUANTIFY MEASURES OF FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY THAT WILL BE USEFUL WHEN EVALUATING FUTURE PLANS FOR EXPANDING THE STUDY OF YOGA IN URBAN, MINORITY POPULATIONS WITH ARTHRITIS.

18 2749  46 YOGA PRACTICE IN THE UK: A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY OF MOTIVATION, HEALTH BENEFITS AND BEHAVIOURS. OBJECTIVES: DESPITE THE POPULARITY OF YOGA AND EVIDENCE OF ITS POSITIVE EFFECTS ON PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT YOGA PRACTICE IN THE UK. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE CHARACTERISTICS OF PEOPLE WHO PRACTISE YOGA, REASONS FOR INITIATING AND MAINTAINING PRACTICE, AND PERCEIVED IMPACT OF YOGA ON HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL ONLINE ANONYMOUS SURVEY DISTRIBUTED THROUGH UK-BASED YOGA ORGANISATIONS, STUDIOS AND EVENTS, THROUGH EMAIL INVITES AND FLYERS. 2434 YOGA PRACTITIONERS COMPLETED THE SURVEY, INCLUDING 903 YOGA TEACHERS: 87% WERE WOMEN, 91% WHITE AND 71% DEGREE EDUCATED; MEAN AGE WAS 48.7 YEARS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PERCEIVED IMPACT OF YOGA ON HEALTH CONDITIONS, HEALTH OUTCOMES AND INJURIES. RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN YOGA PRACTICE AND MEASURES OF HEALTH, LIFESTYLE, STRESS AND WELL-BEING. RESULTS: IN COMPARISON WITH NATIONAL POPULATION NORMS, PARTICIPANTS REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER WELL-BEING BUT ALSO HIGHER ANXIETY; LOWER PERCEIVED STRESS, BODY MASS INDEX AND INCIDENCE OF OBESITY, AND HIGHER RATES OF POSITIVE HEALTH BEHAVIOURS. 47% REPORTED CHANGING THEIR MOTIVATIONS TO PRACTISE YOGA, WITH GENERAL WELLNESS AND FITNESS KEY TO INITIAL UPTAKE, AND STRESS MANAGEMENT AND SPIRITUALITY IMPORTANT TO CURRENT PRACTICE. 16% OF PARTICIPANTS REPORTED STARTING YOGA TO MANAGE A PHYSICAL OR MENTAL HEALTH CONDITION. RESPONDENTS REPORTED THE VALUE OF YOGA FOR A WIDE RANGE OF HEALTH CONDITIONS, MOST NOTABLY FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. 20.7% REPORTED AT LEAST ONE YOGA-RELATED INJURY OVER THEIR LIFETIME. CONTROLLING FOR DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS, FREQUENCY OF YOGA PRACTICE ACCOUNTED FOR SMALL BUT SIGNIFICANT VARIANCE IN HEALTH-RELATED REGRESSION MODELS (P<0.001). CONCLUSION: THE FINDINGS OF THIS FIRST DETAILED UK SURVEY WERE CONSISTENT WITH SURVEYS IN OTHER WESTERN COUNTRIES. YOGA WAS PERCEIVED TO HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS AND WAS LINKED TO POSITIVE HEALTH BEHAVIOURS. FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF YOGA'S ROLE IN SELF-CARE COULD INFORM HEALTH-RELATED CHALLENGES FACED BY MANY COUNTRIES.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
19   11  30 "MAYBE BLACK GIRLS DO YOGA": A FOCUS GROUP STUDY WITH PREDOMINANTLY LOW-INCOME AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN. OBJECTIVE: TO EXPLORE AFRICAN AMERICAN (AA) WOMEN'S USE OF MIND-BODY THERAPIES, SUCH AS YOGA AND MINDFULNESS, AND FACTORS THAT IMPACT THEIR EXPERIENCES, OBSERVATIONS AND OPINIONS. DESIGN: FOCUS GROUPS WERE CONDUCTED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW AA WOMEN PERCEIVE MIND-BODY THERAPIES AND HOW TO BEST BRING THESE INTERVENTIONS INTO THEIR COMMUNITY. INTERVIEWS WERE AUDIOTAPED AND TRANSCRIBED. SETTING: THE URBAN MIDWEST. OUTCOME MEASURES: IN ADDITION TO QUALITATIVE OUTCOMES, DESCRIPTIVE MEASURES INCLUDED THE PERCEIVED STRESSOR SCALE, BELIEFS ABOUT YOGA SCALE, AND DETERMINANTS OF MEDITATION PRACTICE INVENTORY (DOMPI). RESULTS: TWENTY-TWO, PREDOMINANTLY LOW-INCOME (75% REPORTED INCOME <$50,000) AND SINGLE (82%) WOMEN PARTICIPATED IN THREE AGE STRATIFIED FOCUS GROUPS (18-34 YEARS, 35-65 YEARS, 66 YEARS AND OLDER). PARTICIPANTS ACKNOWLEDGED LIFE STRESS AND SHARED COMMON COPING MECHANISMS. THEY RECOGNIZED THAT YOGA AND MINDFULNESS COULD BE BENEFICIAL AND DISCUSSED BARRIERS TO PRACTICE (INCLUDING PERSONAL AND STRUCTURAL). YOUNGER WOMEN REPORTED MORE TIME CONSTRAINTS AS BARRIERS, MIDDLE AGED WOMEN HAD MORE EXPERIENCE WITH YOGA, AND OLDER WOMEN IDENTIFIED THE SPIRITUAL COMPONENT TO YOGA/MINDFULNESS AS POTENTIALLY CONFLICTING WITH CURRENT COPING STRATEGIES. PARTICIPANTS SUGGESTED WAYS TO SHARE MIND-BODY THERAPIES WITHIN THE AA COMMUNITY ALONG WITH SOLUTIONS FOR ENGAGEMENT. CONCLUSIONS: AA WOMEN ACKNOWLEDGED STRESS IN THEIR LIVES AND RECOGNIZED THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL COPING MEASURES. ALTHOUGH WOMEN REPORTED INTEREST IN YOGA/MINDFULNESS THEY IDENTIFIED BARRIERS, INCLUDING LIMITED ACCESS TO CONVENIENT CLASSES, AND OFFERED SUGGESTIONS FOR BRINGING YOGA AND MINDFULNESS TO THEIR COMMUNITIES.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
20 2506  25 YOGA ATTITUDES IN CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: ROLES OF CATASTROPHIZING AND FEAR OF MOVEMENT. CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN IS A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM AND, ALTHOUGH UNDERUSED, YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT. THE CURRENT STUDY EXAMINED ASSOCIATIONS OF PAIN CATASTROPHIZING AND FEAR OF MOVEMENT WITH ATTITUDES TOWARD YOGA IN ADULTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THREE QUANTITATIVE QUESTIONNAIRES ASSESSING SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTS: BELIEFS ABOUT YOGA, FEAR OF MOVEMENT, AND PAIN CATASTROPHIZING. A SEMI-STRUCTURED IN-PERSON INTERVIEW WAS THEN CONDUCTED TO OBTAIN SPECIFIC PAIN-RELATED INFORMATION. HIERARCHICAL REGRESSION AND MEDIATIONAL ANALYSES WERE USED TO TEST HYPOTHESES. CONSISTENT WITH THE FEAR-AVOIDANCE MODEL OF CHRONIC PAIN, CATASTROPHIZING AND FEAR OF MOVEMENT WERE NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA ATTITUDES. SPECIFICALLY, FEAR OF MOVEMENT WAS A MEDIATOR BETWEEN CATASTROPHIZING AND ATTITUDES TOWARD YOGA. INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF CATASTROPHIZING AND FEAR OF MOVEMENT MAY BE LESS LIKELY TO CONSIDER A PAIN TREATMENT INVOLVING PHYSICAL MOVEMENT.	2015

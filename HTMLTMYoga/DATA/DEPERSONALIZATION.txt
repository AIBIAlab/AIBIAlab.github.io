1 1729 151 PERSONALISED YOGA FOR BURNOUT AND TRAUMATIC STRESS IN JUNIOR DOCTORS. OBJECTIVES: JUNIOR DOCTORS ARE FREQUENTLY EXPOSED TO OCCUPATIONAL AND TRAUMATIC STRESS, SOMETIMES WITH TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES. MINDFULNESS-BASED AND FITNESS INTERVENTIONS ARE INCREASINGLY USED TO MITIGATE THIS, BUT HAVE NOT BEEN COMPARED.WE CONDUCTED A RANDOMISED, CONTROLLED PILOT TRIAL TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE INTERVENTIONS IN JUNIOR DOCTORS. METHODS: WE RANDOMISED PARTICIPANTS (N=21) TO WEEKLY 1-HOUR SESSIONS OF PERSONALISED, TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA (N=10), WITH A 4-HOUR WORKSHOP, AND EHEALTH HOMEWORK; OR GROUP-FORMAT FITNESS (N=8) IN AN EXISTING WELLNESS PROGRAMME, MDOK. BURNOUT, TRAUMATIC STRESS AND SUICIDALITY WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE AND 8 WEEKS. RESULTS: BOTH INTERVENTIONS REDUCED BURNOUT, AND YOGA INCREASED COMPASSION SATISFACTION WITHIN GROUP ON THE PROFESSIONAL QUALITY OF LIFE SCALE, WITHOUT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS ON THIS MEASURE.PERSONALISED YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED DEPERSONALISATION (Z=-1.99, P=0.05) COMPARED WITH GROUP FITNESS ON THE MASLACH BURNOUT INVENTORY (MBI-HSS (MP)) AND SHOWED GREATER FLEXIBILITY CHANGES. BOTH INTERVENTIONS INCREASED MBI PERSONAL ACCOMPLISHMENT, WITH NO CHANGES IN OTHER SELF-REPORT PSYCHOLOGICAL OR PHYSIOLOGICAL METRICS, INCLUDING BREATH-COUNTING.PARTICIPANTS DOING ONE-TO-ONE YOGA RATED IT MORE HIGHLY OVERALL (P=0.02) THAN GROUP FITNESS, AND REPORTED IT COMPARATIVELY MORE BENEFICIAL FOR MENTAL (P=0.01) AND PHYSICAL HEALTH (P=0.05). FACE-TO-FACE WEEKLY SESSIONS WERE 100% ATTENDED IN YOGA, BUT ONLY 45% IN FITNESS. CONCLUSION: IN THIS PILOT TRIAL, BOTH YOGA AND FITNESS IMPROVED BURNOUT, BUT TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA REDUCED DEPERSONALISATION IN JUNIOR DOCTORS MORE THAN GROUP-FORMAT FITNESS. ONE-TO-ONE YOGA WAS BETTER ADHERED THAN FITNESS, BUT WAS MORE RESOURCE INTENSIVE. JUNIOR DOCTORS NEED LARGER-SCALE COMPARATIVE RESEARCH OF THE EFFECTIVENESS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF INDIVIDUAL, ORGANISATIONAL AND SYSTEMIC MENTAL HEALTH INTERVENTIONS.

2  278  44 ADDRESSING OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY TRAINEE BURNOUT USING A YOGA-BASED WELLNESS INITIATIVE DURING DEDICATED EDUCATION TIME. OBJECTIVE: TO ESTIMATE THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING A YOGA-BASED WELLNESS PROGRAM DURING TRAINING AND ITS INFLUENCE ON BURNOUT, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, STRESS, AND MINDFULNESS AMONG OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY TRAINEES. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A DEPARTMENTAL QUALITY IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVE CONSISTING OF WEEKLY 1-HOUR YOGA CLASSES CONDUCTED DURING PROTECTED EDUCATION TIME AND NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL CHALLENGES FOR 24 OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY RESIDENTS AND FIVE MATERNAL-FETAL MEDICINE FELLOWS. PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED A FREE WRIST-WORN FITNESS TRACKER DEVICE TO RECORD THEIR ACTIVITY. PREPROGRAM AND POSTPROGRAM DATA COLLECTION INCLUDED RESULTS FROM VALIDATED SCALES ON BURNOUT, MINDFULNESS, DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, BLOOD PRESSURE, HEART RATE, AND WEIGHT. WILCOXON SIGNED RANK TESTS WERE USED FOR ANALYSIS. A P-VALUE <.05 WAS CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT. RESULTS: OVER AN 8-WEEK PERIOD, 90% (N=26) OF PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED AT LEAST ONE YOGA CLASS AND 68% ATTENDED AT LEAST 50% OF THE CLASSES. NO PARTICIPANT COMPLETED ALL SESSIONS. EIGHTY PERCENT (N=20) ENGAGED IN AT LEAST ONE NUTRITION CHALLENGE AND 60% (N=15) IN AT LEAST ONE PHYSICAL CHALLENGE. AFTER THE PROGRAM, A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE DEPERSONALIZATION COMPONENT OF BURNOUT (P=.04), ANXIETY (P=.02), AND SYSTOLIC (PREPROGRAM: 122, POSTPROGRAM: 116 MM HG; P=.01) AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (PREPROGRAM: 82, POSTPROGRAM: 76 MM HG; P=.01) OCCURRED. THOSE PARTICIPANTS WHO ATTENDED MORE THAN 50% OF YOGA CLASSES DEMONSTRATED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE COMPARED WITH LESS-FREQUENT ATTENDEES (P=.02 AND .04, RESPECTIVELY). A POSTPROGRAM SURVEY REVEALED FEELINGS OF INCREASED CAMARADERIE, APPRECIATION, MOTIVATION, AND OVERALL TRAINING EXPERIENCE. DISCUSSION: IMPLEMENTING A WELLNESS PROGRAM CONSISTING OF WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES IS FEASIBLE AND MAY BE BENEFICIAL. A WELLNESS INITIATIVE THAT EMPHASIZES ACTIVE PARTICIPATION DURING EDUCATION TIME WITH THE AUTONOMY TO IMPLEMENT DAILY WELLNESS ACTIVITIES MAY REDUCE BURNOUT AND IMPROVE WELL-BEING.	2019	

3 2618  34 YOGA FOR SELF-CARE AND BURNOUT PREVENTION AMONG NURSES. THE PROMOTION OF SELF-CARE AND THE PREVENTION OF BURNOUT AMONG NURSES IS A PUBLIC HEALTH PRIORITY. EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE EFFICACY OF YOGA TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES, BUT FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE INFLUENCE OF YOGA ON NURSE-SPECIFIC OUTCOMES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT-LEVEL RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA TO IMPROVE SELF-CARE AND REDUCE BURNOUT AMONG NURSES. COMPARED WITH CONTROLS (N = 20), YOGA PARTICIPANTS (N = 20) REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SELF-CARE AS WELL AS LESS EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION AND DEPERSONALIZATION UPON COMPLETION OF AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. ALTHOUGH THE CONTROL GROUP DEMONSTRATED NO CHANGE THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE STUDY, THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SCORES FROM PRE- TO POST-INTERVENTION FOR SELF-CARE (P < .001), MINDFULNESS (P = .028), EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION (P = .008), AND DEPERSONALIZATION (P = .007) OUTCOMES. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE ARE DISCUSSED.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
4 2162  43 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND MINDFUL MEDITATION ON ELDERLY CARE WORKER'S BURNOUT: A CONSORT-COMPLIANT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF MINDFUL MEDITATION AND YOGA ON REDUCING BURNOUT AND STRESS IN CARE WORKERS WHO ASSIST ELDERLY INDIVIDUALS. KNOWING HOW TO REDUCE BURNOUT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT OF CARE WORKERS IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE QUALITY OF CLIENT CARE, WORKER PRODUCTIVITY, AND JOB TURNOVER. PATIENTS AND METHODS: THE PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED 44 CARE WORKERS WHO WORKED FOR ELDERLY CARE FACILITIES IN RURAL FUKUOKA. THEY WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THREE INTERVENTION GROUPS: CONTROL, YOGA, OR MINDFULNESS. IN THE YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP, A CERTIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTOR TAUGHT A 60-MINUTE YOGA SESSION EACH WEEK FOR SIX WEEKS. IN THE MINDFULNESS GROUP, AN EXPERIENCED MEDICAL DOCTOR INSTRUCTED A MINDFUL MEDITATION PROGRAM FOR THE SAME LENGTH. PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO COMPLETE THE JAPANESE BURNOUT SCALE (JBS), AND THE RESEARCH TEAM COLLECTED THE LEVEL OF ALPHA-AMYLASE IN SALIVA USING NIPRO: T-110-N PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTIONS. RESULTS: MANOVA WAS PERFORMED WITH EACH INTERVENTION (CONTROL, YOGA, MINDFULNESS) AS THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE ON THE THREE SUBSCALES OF THE JBS (EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION, DEPERSONALIZATION, AND PERSONAL ACHIEVEMENT) AND A BIOMARKER OF STRESS LEVEL (ALPHA-AMYLASE). THE RESULTS INDICATED A SIGNIFICANT MAIN EFFECT OF INTERVENTIONS, AND A FOLLOW-UP ANOVA SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF INTERVENTIONS ON EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION AND PERSONAL ACHIEVEMENT. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT PRACTICING MINDFUL MEDITATION OR YOGA FOR 60 MINUTES ONCE A WEEK FOR SIX WEEKS CAN REDUCE CARE WORKERS' BURNOUT. THIS STUDY WAS NOTABLE BECAUSE THE BIOMARKER OF STRESS ALSO IMPROVED. IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED AND ENCOURAGED THAT INSTITUTIONS CARING FOR THE ELDERLY POPULATION PROVIDE MINDFUL MEDITATION OR YOGA INTERVENTION TO REDUCE BURNOUT, WHICH BENEFITS NOT ONLY CARE WORKERS BUT ALSO THEIR CLIENTS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                   
5 1330  39 HOLISTIC NURSING IN PRACTICE: MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION TO MANAGE STRESS AND BURNOUT. PURPOSE: EFFECTS OF A MINDFULNESS-BASED (MB) YOGA PRACTICE ON STRESS, BURNOUT, AND INDICATORS OF WELL-BEING AMONG NURSES AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (HCPS). DESIGN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, 80 HCPS ASSIGNED TO EITHER MB YOGA INTERVENTION OR CONTROL GROUP. METHOD: THE MB YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 41) ATTENDED WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES AND PRACTICED YOGA INDEPENDENTLY. THE CONTROL GROUP (N = 39) DID NOT RECEIVE THE YOGA INTERVENTION. STUDY PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED PRE- AND POSTINTERVENTION QUESTIONNAIRES, INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED (A) PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE; (B) MASLACH BURNOUT INVENTORY; (C) VITALITY SUBSCALE OF THE MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY SHORT FORM-36; (D) GLOBAL SLEEP QUALITY ITEM, (E) MINDFULNESS AWARENESS SURVEY, AND (F) SUBSCALE OF THE BRIEF SERENITY SCALE. DIURNAL SALIVARY CORTISOL AND BLOOD PRESSURE WERE ASSESSED PRE AND POSTINTERVENTION. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS (P < .01) NOTED IN MB YOGA COMPARED WITH CONTROL FOR SELF-REPORTED FACTORS, INCLUDING STRESS (PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE), BURNOUT (MASLACH BURNOUT INVENTORY), VITALITY (MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY SHORT FORM-36), SLEEP (GSQ), SERENITY/INNER HAVEN (IH), AND MINDFULNESS (MINDFULNESS AWARENESS SURVEY). DIURNAL CORTISOL SLOPES AND BLOOD PRESSURE WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED. CONCLUSION: THE MB YOGA INTERVENTION HAD A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF NURSES AND HCPS, MOST SPECIFICALLY FOR MEASURES OF STRESS; PERCEIVED STRESS, BURNOUT, VITALITY, SLEEP QUALITY, SERENITY, AND MINDFULNESS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
6  256  42 A YOGA-BASED PROGRAM DECREASES PHYSICIAN BURNOUT IN NEONATOLOGISTS AND OBSTETRICIANS AT AN ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER. BACKGROUND: NEARLY HALF OF U.S. PEDIATRICIANS HAVE SYMPTOMS OF BURNOUT. THIS PILOT STUDY EXAMINED THE FEASIBILITY OF A 6-WEEK YOGA-BASED PROGRAM (RISE) FOR NEONATOLOGISTS AND OBSTETRICIANS AT BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL AND STUDIED THE EFFECTS ON BURNOUT, PROFESSIONAL FULFILLMENT, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED VIA EMAIL TO PARTICIPATE EITHER IN BOTH PROGRAM AND RESEARCH STUDY, OR EXCLUSIVELY THE PROGRAM. RISE WAS DELIVERED 1 HOUR/WEEK DURING THE WORKDAY FOR 6 CONSECUTIVE WEEKS EITHER IN-PERSON OR REMOTELY; 18 PHYSICIANS PARTICIPATED, 12 COMPLETED POST-PROGRAM, AND 11 COMPLETED 2-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. THE QUESTIONNAIRES ASSESSED BURNOUT AND MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH, PROFESSIONAL FULFILLMENT, WORK EXHAUSTION, INTERPERSONAL DISENGAGEMENT/BURNOUT (PFI), MINDFULNESS (FFMQ), PERCEIVED STRESS (PSS), POSITIVE/NEGATIVE AFFECT (PANAS), RESILIENCE (RS), ANXIETY/DEPRESSION/SLEEP DISTURBANCES (PROMIS), AT BASELINE, POST-PROGRAM, AND 2 MONTHS AFTER RISE. FINDINGS: AVERAGE ATTENDANCE IN-PERSON WAS 2.8 SESSIONS AND REMOTELY 1.4 SESSIONS (4.2/6 SESSIONS). PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATING TOTAL BURNOUT REDUCED FROM 50.0% AT BASELINE TO 9.1% POST-PROGRAM. PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATING PROFESSIONAL FULFILLMENT WERE 8.3% AT BASELINE AND 27.3% POST-PROGRAM. PAIRED SAMPLES T-TESTS REVEALED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN BURNOUT, PROFESSIONAL FULFILLMENT, INTERPERSONAL DISENGAGEMENT, STRESS, RESILIENCE, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION AT POST-PROGRAM COMPARED WITH BASELINE (N = 12, ALL PS < .05). AT 2-MONTH FOLLOW-UP, STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN INTERPERSONAL DISENGAGEMENT, RESILIENCE, AND MINDFULNESS (N = 11, ALL PS < .05) COMPARED WITH BASELINE WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS/APPLICATION TO PRACTICE: RISE IS FEASIBLE WITHIN A WORKDAY AND MAY ADDRESS BURNOUT AND OTHER PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH MEASURES IN PHYSICIANS WITH EFFECTS POTENTIALLY SUSTAINABLE OVER 2 MONTHS. OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH PRACTITIONERS IN HEALTH CARE SHOULD CONSIDER THIS TYPE OF INTERVENTION FOR THEIR WORKERS.	2020	
                 
7 1367  33 IMPACT OF A MINDFULNESS-BASED, WORKPLACE GROUP YOGA INTERVENTION ON BURNOUT, SELF-CARE, AND COMPASSION IN HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER A WORKPLACE, GROUP MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION COULD HELP MANAGE BURNOUT AND IMPROVE WELLBEING AMONG HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 43 HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS PARTICIPATED IN 8-WEEK SUPERVISED WORKPLACE, GROUP MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA ACTIVITIES. THE AUTHORS USED A SINGLE-SAMPLE, PRE-POST DESIGN. AT TWO POINTS IN TIME (BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION), PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED A SET OF ONLINE MEASURES ASSESSING BURNOUT, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, STRESS, RESILIENCE, AND COMPASSION. THE AUTHORS USED LINEAR MIXED MODEL ANALYSIS TO ASSESS CHANGES IN OUTCOME MEASURES. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS HAD IMPROVEMENTS AFTER THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION. AT POSTINTERVENTION, THEY HAD SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER SCORES ON PERSONAL ACCOMPLISHMENT, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, STRESS, PERCEIVED RESILIENCE, AND COMPASSION. PARTICIPANTS HAD A POSITIVE PERCEPTION OF THE YOGA INTERVENTION. CONCLUSION: GROUP MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA PROGRAM MAY BE CONVENIENT AND LOW-COST APPROACH TO SUPPORT HEALTH AND WELLBEING AMONG HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
8  130  36 A PRAGMATIC CONTROLLED TRIAL OF A BRIEF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED PROGRAM FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS. OBJECTIVES: TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELLBEING IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS THAT ATTENDED A BRIEF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED PROGRAM. DESIGN: PRAGMATIC CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS THAT ATTENDED A YOGA MINDFULNESS-BASED PROGRAM (N = 9) TO A WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 22). SETTING: THE 3-DAY PROGRAM WAS DELIVERED AT THE KRIPALU CENTER FOR YOGA & HEALTH IN MASSACHUSETTS. INTERVENTION: THE 3-DAY YOGA MINDFULNESS PROGRAM INCLUDED 5 HOURS PER DAY OF YOGA, MINDFULNESS EXERCISES, FORMAL MEDITATION, DIDACTIC, AND EXPERIENTIAL ACTIVITIES. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELLBEING WERE COMPLETED BEFORE (BASELINE), IMMEDIATELY AFTER (POST-PROGRAM), AND TWO MONTHS AFTER THE PROGRAM (FOLLOW-UP). RESULTS: RELATIVE TO CONTROLS (N = 21), THE RISE GROUP (N = 9) SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN POSITIVE AFFECT (P = .033), NEGATIVE AFFECT (P = .044), MINDFULNESS (P = .001), EMPOWERMENT (P = .022), SELF-COMPASSION (P = .001), AND WORK ENGAGEMENT FROM BASELINE TO POST-PROGRAM. FROM BASELINE TO FOLLOW-UP, THE RISE GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN STRESS (P = .008), NEGATIVE AFFECT (P = .013), MINDFULNESS (P = .001), EMPOWERMENT (P = .007), AND SELF-COMPASSION (P = .001) COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: THE YOGA MINDFULNESS PROGRAM WAS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN EDUCATORS' PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELLBEING IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING AND 2-MONTHS FOLLOWING THE PROGRAM. FUTURE RESEARCH WITH A LARGER SAMPLE SIZE IS NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE RESULTS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
9 2769  35 YOGA REDUCES PERCEIVED STRESS AND EXHAUSTION LEVELS IN HEALTHY ELDERLY INDIVIDUALS. UNLABELLED: THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED WHETHER A 7-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION COULD IMPROVE PHYSICAL FUNCTION, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND MENTAL/EMOTIONAL WELLNESS IN ELDERLY PARTICIPANTS. METHODS: 8 PARTICIPANTS (66.5 +/- 0.3 YEARS) ATTENDED 2 60-MIN HATHA YOGA SESSIONS/WEEK FOR 7 WEEKS, AND PERFORMED PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION ASSESSMENTS. BALANCE WAS ASSESSED USING A 5-TEST BATTERY. FLEXIBILITY WAS MEASURED BY SIT-AND-REACH AND SHOULDER FLEXIBILITY TESTS. FUNCTIONAL MOBILITY TESTS INCLUDED 8-FT UP-AND-GO, 5 CHAIR STANDS, AND 4-M WALK. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED SF-12, EXHAUSTION LEVEL, AND PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE (PSS) QUESTIONNAIRES. RESULTS: SF-12 MENTAL COMPONENT SUMMARY SCORES, EXHAUSTION LEVELS, AND PSS SCORES IMPROVED POST-INTERVENTION. NO DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND FOR PHYSICAL FUNCTION MEASURES. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA PARTICIPATION CAN IMPROVE MENTAL/EMOTIONAL WELLNESS, EXHAUSTION LEVELS, AND STRESS LEVELS IN ELDERLY INDIVIDUALS, EVEN WITHOUT MEASURABLE IMPROVEMENTS IN PHYSICAL FUNCTION. CLINICIANS AND HEALTH PRACTITIONERS WHO WORK WITH THE ELDERLY SHOULD CONSIDER YOGA AS A POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC MODALITY FOR IMPROVING IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF QUALITY OF LIFE IN THIS POPULATION.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
10 1428  44 IMPROVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING FOLLOWING A BRIEF YOGA-BASED PROGRAM FOR EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS WHO ATTENDED A YOGA-BASED PROGRAM. METHODS: EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS WHO ATTENDED A 3-DAY YOGA-BASED RISE (RESILIENCE, INTEGRATION, SELF-AWARENESS, ENGAGEMENT) PROGRAM WERE RECRUITED TO PARTICIPATE. RISE WAS ADMINISTERED AT THE KRIPALU CENTER FOR YOGA & HEALTH. MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING, AND HEALTH-RELATED BEHAVIORS WERE COMPLETED BEFORE (BASELINE), AFTER (POST), AND 2 MONTHS AFTER RISE (FOLLOW-UP). FORTY-FOUR PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED BASELINE AND POST AND WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. OF THOSE, 33 PARTICIPANTS ALSO COMPLETED THE FOLLOW-UP. PAIRED SAMPLES T TESTS WERE USED TO COMPARE SCORES BETWEEN TIME POINTS. RESULTS: COMPARED TO BASELINE, AT POST, PARTICIPANTS SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS IN PERCEIVED STRESS, MINDFULNESS, EMPOWERMENT, POSITIVE AFFECT, NEGATIVE AFFECT, SELF-COMPASSION, TOTAL WORK ENGAGEMENT, VIGOR, SLEEP QUALITY (ALL P VALUES < .001), RESILIENCE, SATISFACTION WITH LIFE, AS WELL AS EXHAUSTION AND PROFESSIONAL EFFICACY WHICH ARE DIMENSIONS OF BURNOUT (ALL P VALUES < .01). AT THE FOLLOW-UP, SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE MAINTAINED FOR MINDFULNESS, EMPOWERMENT, SELF-COMPASSION, SLEEP QUALITY (ALL P VALUES < .001), RESILIENCE, VIGOR, AND EXHAUSTION (ALL P VALUES < .01) AND POSITIVE AFFECT, SATISFACTION WITH LIFE, AND WORK ENGAGEMENT (ALL P VALUES < .05). CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE YOGA-BASED RISE PROGRAM IMPROVES PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS. IN ADDITION, PARTICIPANTS REPORTED THAT ATTENDING RISE WAS FEASIBLE, THEY COULD CONTINUE USING RISE PRACTICES LONG-TERM, SHARED THEM WITH WORK COLLEAGUES, AND REPORTED THAT RISE POSITIVELY IMPACTED BOTH THEIR DAILY LIVES AND WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT. WITH THESE PROMISING RESULTS, ADDITIONAL CONTROLLED RESEARCH IS WARRANTED.	2019	
                                                                                                                         
11 1174  54 EVALUATION OF A YOGA-BASED MIND-BODY INTERVENTION FOR RESIDENT PHYSICIANS: A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS (MBIS) HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL INTERVENTIONS FOR MITIGATING PHYSICIAN BURNOUT, BUT THERE ARE NO CONTROLLED STUDIES OF YOGA-BASED MBIS IN RESIDENT PHYSICIANS. WE ASSESSED THE FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA-BASED MBI CALLED RISE (RESILIENCE, INTEGRATION, SELF-AWARENESS, ENGAGEMENT) FOR RESIDENTS AMONG MULTIPLE SPECIALTIES AND ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A WAITLIST CONTROLLED RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL OF THE RISE PROGRAM WITH RESIDENTS FROM MULTIPLE SPECIALTY DEPARTMENTS AT THREE ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS. THE RISE PROGRAM CONSISTED OF SIX WEEKLY SESSIONS WITH SUGGESTED HOME PRACTICE. FEASIBILITY WAS ASSESSED ACROSS SIX DOMAINS: DEMAND, IMPLEMENTATION, PRACTICALITY, ACCEPTABILITY, ADAPTATION, AND INTEGRATION. SELF-REPORTED MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE, POST-PROGRAM, AND TWO-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: AMONG 2,000 RESIDENTS CONTACTED, 75 WERE ASSESSED FOR ELIGIBILITY AND 56 WERE ENROLLED. FORTY-FOUR PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE STUDY AND WERE INCLUDED IN ANALYSIS. ON AVERAGE, PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED TWO OF SIX SESSIONS. FEASIBILITY OF IN-PERSON ATTENDANCE WAS RATED AS 28.9 (SD 25.6) ON A 100-POINT VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE. PARTICIPANTS RATED FEASIBILITY AS 69.2 (SD 26.0) IF THE PROGRAM WAS OFFERED VIRTUALLY. THOSE WHO RECEIVED RISE REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN MINDFULNESS, STRESS, BURNOUT, AND PHYSICIAN WELL-BEING FROM BASELINE TO POST-PROGRAM, WHICH WERE SUSTAINED AT TWO-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. CONCLUSION: THIS IS THE FIRST CONTROLLED STUDY OF A YOGA-BASED MBI IN RESIDENTS. WHILE THE PROGRAM WAS NOT FEASIBLE AS DELIVERED IN THIS PILOT STUDY, INITIAL ANALYSES SHOWED IMPROVEMENT IN MULTIPLE MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH. RESIDENTS REPORTED THAT VIRTUAL DELIVERY WOULD INCREASE FEASIBILITY.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
12   38  39 A 3-DAY RESIDENTIAL YOGA-BASED PROGRAM IMPROVES EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS' PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH IN A SINGLE ARM TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY EXAMINED CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH IN URBAN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS AFTER ATTENDING A BRIEF YOGA-BASED PROGRAM. METHODS: EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS FROM THE NEW YORK CITY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION (NYC DOE) WHO WERE ATTENDING A RESIDENTIAL 3-DAY YOGA-BASED PROGRAM AT KRIPALU CENTER FOR YOGA & HEALTH WERE RECRUITED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY. MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND HEALTH-RELATED BEHAVIORS WERE COMPLETED BEFORE (BASELINE), AFTER (POST), AND TWO MONTHS AFTER THE PROGRAM (FOLLOW-UP). PAIRED SAMPLES T-TESTS WERE USED TO COMPARE SCORES BETWEEN TIME POINTS. RESULTS: AT POST, PARTICIPANTS (N=74) SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS IN STRESS, RESILIENCE, AFFECT, MINDFULNESS, EMPOWERMENT, SELF-COMPASSION, SATISFACTION WITH LIFE, WORK ENGAGEMENT, BURNOUT, EXERCISE, AND VEGETABLE INTAKE (ALL P VALUES < 0.05) COMPARED TO BASELINE. AT THE FOLLOW-UP (N=33), SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS IN RESILIENCE, AFFECT, MINDFULNESS, EMPOWERMENT, SELF-COMPASSION, WORK ENGAGEMENT, AND BURNOUT (ALL P VALUES < 0.05) COMPARED TO BASELINE. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS BETWEEN THE DEGREE OF HOME PRACTICE OF THE SKILLS AND TECHNIQUES LEARNED IN THE PROGRAM AND IMPROVEMENTS IN MULTIPLE MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AT FOLLOW-UP (ALL P VALUES < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE YOGA-BASED PROGRAM IMPROVES PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND HEALTHY BEHAVIORS IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE PROGRAM AND UP TO TWO-MONTHS FOLLOWING THE PROGRAM, HOWEVER, MORE DATA WITH LARGER SAMPLE SIZES ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM SUSTAINED BENEFITS OVER THE LONGER TERM.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
13 1681  31 ONLINE ISHA UPA YOGA FOR STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING DURING COVID-19: A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL. COLLEGE STUDENTS EXPERIENCED INCREASED STRESS AND ANXIETY DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THIS STUDY EVALUATED THE EFFECT OF BRIEF ONLINE ISHA UPA YOGA MODULES ON UNDERGRADUATES' MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL (RCT) WITH WAITLIST CONTROL CROSSOVER (N = 679). THE INTERVENTION GROUP WAS INSTRUCTED TO LEARN AND PRACTICE THE MODULES DAILY FOR 12 WEEKS. AT THE END OF THE 4-WEEK RCT, THE CONTROL GROUP WAS INSTRUCTED TO LEARN AND PRACTICE THE MODULES FOR THE REMAINING 8 WEEKS. PRIMARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED STRESS AND WELL-BEING. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, RESILIENCE, POSITIVE AFFECT AND NEGATIVE AFFECT. LINEAR MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS WERE USED FOR ANALYSES. ISHA UPA YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED STRESS (GROUP [INTERVENTION, CONTROL] X TIME [BASELINE, WEEK 4] INTERACTION, P = .009, D = .27) AND INCREASED WELL-BEING (GROUP X TIME INTERACTION P = .002, D = .32). BY THE STUDY'S END, THE INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN WELL-BEING (P < .001, P < .001), STRESS (P < .001, P < .001), ANXIETY (P < .001, P < .001), DEPRESSION (P < .001, P = .004), POSITIVE AFFECT (P = .04, P < .001), AND NEGATIVE AFFECT (P < .001, P < .001). ONLINE ISHA UPA YOGA SHOWS PROMISE FOR MITIGATING THE PANDEMIC'S NEGATIVE IMPACT ON UNDERGRADUATES' MENTAL HEALTH AND IMPROVING THEIR WELL-BEING.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
14 1372  34 IMPACT OF A YOGA AND MEDITATION INTERVENTION ON STUDENTS' STRESS AND ANXIETY LEVELS. OBJECTIVE. TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF A SIX-WEEK YOGA AND MEDITATION INTERVENTION ON COLLEGE STUDENTS' STRESS PERCEPTION, ANXIETY LEVELS, AND MINDFULNESS SKILLS. METHODS. COLLEGE STUDENTS PARTICIPATED IN A SIX-WEEK PILOT PROGRAM THAT CONSISTED OF A 60-MINUTE VINYASA FLOW YOGA CLASS ONCE WEEKLY, FOLLOWED BY GUIDED MEDITATION DELIVERED BY TRAINED FACULTY MEMBERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND COLLEGE OF PHARMACY. STUDENTS COMPLETED PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION QUESTIONNAIRES TO EVALUATE CHANGES IN THE FOLLOWING OUTCOMES: STRESS LEVELS, ANXIETY LEVELS, AND MINDFULNESS SKILLS. THE QUESTIONNAIRE CONSISTED OF THREE SELF-REPORTING TOOLS: THE BECK ANXIETY INVENTORY (BAI), THE PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE (PSS), AND THE FIVE FACET MINDFULNESS QUESTIONNAIRE (FFMQ). STUDENTS' SCORES ON EACH WERE ASSESSED TO DETECT ANY CHANGES FROM BASELINE USING THE NUMERICAL AND CATEGORICAL SCALES (LOW, MEDIUM, AND HIGH) FOR EACH INSTRUMENT. RESULTS. SEVENTEEN PARTICIPANTS, AGED 19 TO 23 YEARS, COMPLETED THE STUDY. THIRTEEN PARTICIPANTS WERE FEMALE AND FOUR WERE MALE. NINE OF THE STUDENTS WERE ENROLLED IN THE DOCTOR OF PHARMACY PROGRAM AND EIGHT WERE ENROLLED IN OTHER ACADEMIC PROGRAMS. STUDENTS' ANXIETY AND STRESS SCORES DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY WHILE THEIR TOTAL MINDFULNESS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. CHANGES IN CATEGORICAL DATA FROM PRE- TO POST-INTERVENTION ON THE BAI AND PSS WERE SIGNIFICANT, WITH NO STUDENTS SCORING IN THE "HIGH" CATEGORY FOR STRESS OR ANXIETY ON THE POST-INTERVENTION QUESTIONNAIRE. CONCLUSION. STUDENTS EXPERIENCED A REDUCTION IN STRESS AND ANXIETY LEVELS AFTER COMPLETING A SIX-WEEK YOGA AND MEDITATION PROGRAM PRECEDING FINAL EXAMINATIONS. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ADOPTING A MINDFULNESS PRACTICE FOR AS LITTLE AS ONCE PER WEEK MAY REDUCE STRESS AND ANXIETY IN COLLEGE STUDENTS. ADMINISTRATORS SHOULD CONSIDER INCLUDING INSTRUCTION IN NONPHARMACOLOGIC STRESS AND ANXIETY REDUCTION METHODS, WITHIN CURRICULA IN ORDER TO SUPPORT STUDENT SELF-CARE.	2019	
                                                                                                                 
15 1620  49 MINDFUL2WORK: EFFECTS OF COMBINED PHYSICAL EXERCISE, YOGA, AND MINDFULNESS MEDITATIONS FOR STRESS RELIEVE IN EMPLOYEES. A PROOF OF CONCEPT STUDY. WORK-RELATED STRESS AND ASSOCIATED ILLNESS AND BURNOUT IS RISING IN WESTERN SOCIETY, WITH NOW AS MUCH AS ALMOST A QUARTER OF EUROPEAN AND HALF OF USA'S EMPLOYEES ESTIMATED TO BE AT THE POINT OF BURNOUT. MINDFULNESS MEDITATION, YOGA, AND PHYSICAL EXERCISE HAVE ALL SHOWN BENEFICIAL EFFECTS FOR WORK-RELATED STRESS AND ILLNESS. THIS PROOF OF CONCEPT STUDY ASSESSED THE FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND PRELIMINARY EFFECTS OF THE NEWLY DEVELOPED MINDFUL2WORK TRAINING, A COMBINATION OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE, RESTORATIVE YOGA, AND MINDFULNESS MEDITATIONS, DELIVERED IN SIX WEEKLY GROUP SESSIONS PLUS A FOLLOW-UP SESSION. PARTICIPANTS (N = 26, FOUR MALES), REFERRED BY COMPANY DOCTORS WITH (WORK-RELATED) STRESS AND BURNOUT COMPLAINTS, COMPLETED MEASUREMENTS PRE AND POST THE INTERVENTION, AS WELL AS AT 6-WEEK (FU1) AND 6-MONTH (FU2) FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS SHOWED VERY HIGH FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF THE MINDFUL2WORK TRAINING. THE TRAINING AND TRAINERS WERE RATED WITH AN 8.1 AND 8.4 ON A 1-10 SCALE, RESPECTIVELY, AND TRAINING DROPOUT RATE WAS ZERO. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WITH (VERY) LARGE EFFECT SIZES WERE DEMONSTRATED FOR THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES OF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WORKABILITY, AND FOR ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, STRESS, SLEEP QUALITY, POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECT, WHICH REMAINED (VERY) LARGE AND MOSTLY INCREASED FURTHER OVER TIME. RISK FOR LONG-TERM DROPOUT FROM WORK (CHECKLIST INDIVIDUAL STRENGTH [CIS]) WAS 92 % AT PRE-TEST, REDUCED TO 67 % AT POST-TEST, TO 44 % AT FU1, AND 35 % AT FU2, WHEREAS EMPLOYEES WORKED (RTWI) 65 % OF THEIR CONTRACT HOURS PER WEEK AT PRE-TEST, WHICH INCREASED TO 73 % AT POST-TEST, 81 % AT FU1 AND 93 % AT FU2. INTENSITY OF HOME PRACTICE OR NUMBER OF ATTENDED SESSIONS WERE NOT RELATED TO TRAINING EFFECTS. TO CONCLUDE, THE NEWLY DEVELOPED MINDFUL2WORK TRAINING SEEMS VERY FEASIBLE, AND ACCEPTABLE, AND ALTHOUGH NO CONTROL GROUP WAS INCLUDED, THE LARGE EFFECTS OF MINDFUL2WORK ARE HIGHLY PROMISING.	2017	
                                                                       
16 1341  53 HOW JUNIOR DOCTORS PERCEIVE PERSONALISED YOGA AND GROUP EXERCISE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF OCCUPATIONAL AND TRAUMATIC STRESSORS. OBJECTIVES: JUNIOR DOCTORS ARE EXPOSED TO OCCUPATIONAL AND TRAUMATIC STRESSORS, SOME OF WHICH ARE INHERENT TO MEDICINE. THIS CAN RESULT IN BURNOUT, MENTAL ILL-HEALTH AND SUICIDE. WITHIN A CROSSOVER PILOT STUDY COMPARING PERSONALISED, TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA TO GROUP-FORMAT EXERCISE, QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED TO UNDERSTAND THE EXPERIENCE OF JUNIOR DOCTORS AND WHETHER SUCH INTERVENTIONS WERE PERCEIVED TO HELP MANAGE THESE STRESSORS. METHODS: TWENTY-ONE DOCTORS, 76% FEMALE, WERE ORDER-RANDOMISED TO CONSECUTIVE 8-WEEK YOGA AND EXERCISE PROGRAMMES. FIFTY-TWO INTERVIEWS WERE RECORDED BEFORE AND AFTER EACH PROGRAMME. RESULTS: MANY PARTICIPANTS REPORTED BEING TIME POOR, SLEEP-AFFECTED, FREQUENTLY STRESSED AND OCCASIONALLY IN PHYSICAL PAIN/DISTRESS. MAJOR STRESSOR THEMES WERE WORKPLACE INCIVILITY, DEATH/HUMAN SUFFERING AND SHIFT WORK WITH MINIMAL SUPPORT. BOTH INTERVENTIONS WERE ACCEPTABLE FOR DIFFERENT REASONS. PERSONALISED YOGA OFFERED A THERAPEUTIC ALLIANCE, TIME TO CHECK-IN AND REDUCED ANXIETY/RUMINATION. GROUP EXERCISE PROVIDED ENERGY AND SOCIAL CONNECTION. ONE PARTICIPANT FOUND YOGA BENEFICIAL FOLLOWING AN ACUTE WORKPLACE TRAUMA: 'IT WAS REALLY EYE OPENING HOW MUCH I FELT MY BODY JUST NEEDED TO DETOX ... I WOULDN'T HAVE GONE TO A GROUP FITNESS THE NEXT DAY ... I JUST WANTED TO RELAX AND BREATHE ...WE STILL HAD A BIG DEBRIEF WHICH WAS GREAT ... (BUT) I ALMOST FELT LIKE ... I DEALT WITH IT PHYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY BEFORE GOING INTO IT (P20).' CONCLUSION: JUNIOR DOCTORS FOUND BOTH INTERVENTIONS USEFUL FOR STRESS MANAGEMENT ADJUNCTIVE TO OTHER ORGANISATIONAL PROGRAMMES THOUGH FOR DIFFERENT AND COMPLEMENTARY REASONS, POSSIBLY RELATED TO DELIVERY MODE. PERSONALISED, TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA PROVIDED A CONFIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC ALLIANCE WHEREAS GROUP EXERCISE OFFERED SOCIAL CONNECTION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
17 1429  41 IMPROVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING IN A PRAGMATIC CONTROLLED TRIAL OF A YOGA-BASED PROGRAM FOR PROFESSIONALS. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PRAGMATIC CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING IN PROFESSIONALS WHO ATTENDED A YOGA-BASED PROGRAM. SETTING: THE 5-DAY RISE (RESILIENCE, INTEGRATION, SELF-AWARENESS, ENGAGEMENT) PROGRAM WAS DELIVERED AT THE KRIPALU CENTER FOR YOGA & HEALTH. RISE INCLUDED 5 H PER DAY OF YOGA, MEDITATION, LECTURES, AND EXPERIENTIAL ACTIVITIES. SUBJECTS: ADULT PROFESSIONALS FROM EDUCATION, CORRECTIONS, AND SOCIAL SERVICE INSTITUTIONS WERE PRAGMATICALLY ASSIGNED TO THE RISE GROUP (N = 61) OR A WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 60). OUTCOME MEASURES: MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING WERE COMPLETED BEFORE RISE (BASELINE), IMMEDIATELY AFTER RISE (POSTPROGRAM), AND 2 MONTHS AFTER RISE (FOLLOW-UP). ANALYSES OF COVARIANCE WERE CONDUCTED TO COMPARE CHANGE SCORES BETWEEN GROUPS. RESULTS: EIGHTY-TWO PARTICIPANTS (RISE N = 41, CONTROL N = 41) COMPLETED BASELINE AND POSTMEASURES AND WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS, AND 57 (RISE N = 27, CONTROL N = 30) ALSO COMPLETED THE FOLLOW-UP. RELATIVE TO CONTROLS, THE RISE GROUP REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN STRESS (P = 0.001, R(2) = 0.51), RESILIENCE (P = 0.028, R(2) = 0.34), POSITIVE AFFECT (P = 0.001, R(2) = 0.52), NEGATIVE AFFECT (P = 0.001, R(2) = 0.52), MINDFULNESS (P = 0.021, R(2) = 0.13), AND JOB SATISFACTION (P = 0.034, R(2) = 0.08) FROM BASELINE TO POSTPROGRAM. FROM BASELINE TO FOLLOW-UP, COMPARED WITH CONTROLS THE RISE GROUP SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS IN STRESS (P = 0.001, R(2) = 0.33), RESILIENCE (P = 0.001, R(2) = 0.24), POSITIVE AFFECT (P = 0.006, R(2) = 0.49), NEGATIVE AFFECT (P = 0.043, R(2) = 0.32), MINDFULNESS (P = 0.001, R(2) = 0.28), EMPOWERMENT (P = 0.005, R(2) = 0.20), AND SELF-COMPASSION (P = 0.011, R(2) = 0.19). CONCLUSIONS: THE RISE PROGRAM WAS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING IMMEDIATELY AFTER AND 2 MONTHS AFTER THE PROGRAM. FUTURE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE RESULTS.	2019	
                                                             
18  589  34 DETERMINING THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON JOB SATISFACTION AND BURNOUT OF NURSE ACADEMICIANS. PURPOSE: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON BURNOUT AND JOB SATISFACTION OF NURSING ACADEMICIANS. DESIGN AND METHODS: THE RESEARCH IS AN EXPERIMENTAL CLINICAL TRIAL CONDUCTED AS PRETEST-POSTTEST WITH CONTROL GROUPS BETWEEN MARCH AND AUGUST 2019 IN A NURSING FACULTY. PARTICIPANTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WERE GIVEN YOGA PRACTICE (N = 33) TWICE A WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS. DATA WERE COLLECTED BY USING MBI AND MSQ. FINDINGS: THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP'S MEAN POSTTEST PERSONAL ACHIEVEMENT, EXTRINSIC SATISFACTION AND GENERAL SATISFACTION SCORES WERE HIGHER THAN THAT OF CONTROL GROUP PARTICIPANTS, AND A HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND BETWEEN THE GROUPS. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: YOGA PRACTICE IS EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE BURNOUT AND INCREASING JOB SATISFACTION OF NURSING ACADEMICIANS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
19 1430  29 IMPROVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH FOLLOWING A RESIDENTIAL YOGA-BASED PROGRAM FOR FRONTLINE PROFESSIONALS. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF A RESIDENTIAL YOGA-BASED PROGRAM ON PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH AND HEALTH BEHAVIORS IN FRONTLINE PROFESSIONALS. METHODS: FRONTLINE PROFESSIONALS FROM EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE, HUMAN SERVICES, AND CORRECTIONS PARTICIPATED IN THE RISE (RESILIENCE, INTEGRATION, SELF-AWARENESS, ENGAGEMENT) PROGRAM AND COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES AT BASELINE, POST-PROGRAM, AND 2 MONTHS FOLLOWING RISE. RESULTS: PAIRED SAMPLES T TESTS REVEALED IMPROVEMENTS IN MINDFULNESS, STRESS, RESILIENCE, AFFECT, AND SLEEP QUALITY FROM BASELINE TO POST-PROGRAM (ALL PS < 0.001, N = 55), WHICH WERE SUSTAINED AT THE 2-MONTH FOLLOW-UP (ALL PS < 0.01, N = 40). PARTICIPANTS ALSO REPORTED INCREASES IN EXERCISE, FRUIT, AND VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION POST-PROGRAM (ALL PS < 0.001), ALL OF WHICH PERSISTED AT THE 2-MONTH FOLLOW-UP (ALL PS < 0.01) EXCEPT EXERCISE. CONCLUSION: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT RISE IMPROVED INDICES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH AND HEALTHY BEHAVIORS THAT REMAINED 2 MONTHS FOLLOWING RISE.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
20 1832  36 PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING, HEALTH BEHAVIORS, AND WEIGHT LOSS AMONG PARTICIPANTS IN A RESIDENTIAL, KRIPALU YOGA-BASED WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM. UNLABELLED: THE INCREASING PREVALENCE OF OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY IN HUMANS IS A GROWING PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN IN THE UNITED STATES. CONCOMITANTS INCLUDE POOR HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND REDUCED PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING. PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE SUGGESTS YOGA AND TREATMENT PARADIGMS INCORPORATING MINDFULNESS, SELF-COMPASSION (SC), ACCEPTANCE, NON-DIETING, AND INTUITIVE EATING MAY IMPROVE THESE ANCILLARY CORRELATES, WHICH MAY PROMOTE LONG-TERM WEIGHT LOSS. METHODS: WE EXPLORED THE IMPACT OF A 5-DAY RESIDENTIAL WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM, WHICH WAS MULTIFACETED AND BASED ON KRIPALU YOGA, ON HEALTH BEHAVIORS, WEIGHT LOSS, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING IN OVERWEIGHT/OBESE INDIVIDUALS. THIRTY-SEVEN OVERWEIGHT/OBESE PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS (AGE 32-65, BMI<25) COMPLETED VALIDATED MIND-FULNESS, SC, LIFESTYLE BEHAVIOR, AND MOOD QUESTIONNAIRES AT BASELINE, POST-PROGRAM, AND 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP AND REPORTED THEIR WEIGHT 1 YEAR AFTER PROGRAM COMPLETION. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN NUTRITION BEHAVIORS, SC, MINDFULNESS, STRESS MANAGEMENT, AND SPIRITUAL GROWTH WERE OBSERVED IMMEDIATELY POST-PROGRAM (N = 31, 84% RETENTION), WITH MEDIUM TO LARGE EFFECT SIZES. AT 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP (N = 18, 49% RETENTION), MOST CHANGES PERSISTED. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND MOOD DISTURBANCE HAD IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY POST-PROGRAM BUT FAILED TO REACH SIGNIFICANCE AT 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. SELF-REPORT WEIGHT LOSS AT 1 YEAR (N = 19, 51% RETENTION) WAS SIGNIFICANT. CONCLUSION: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST A KRIPALU YOGA-BASED, RESIDENTIAL WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM MAY FOSTER PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING, IMPROVED NUTRITION BEHAVIORS, AND WEIGHT LOSS. GIVEN THE EXPLORATORY NATURE OF THIS INVESTIGATION, MORE RIGOROUS WORK IN THIS AREA IS WARRANTED.	2012

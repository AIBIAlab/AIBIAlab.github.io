1  132 124 A PRAGMATIC MULTICENTERED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: ECONOMIC EVALUATION. STUDY DESIGN: MULTICENTERED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH QUALITY OF LIFE AND RESOURCE USE DATA COLLECTED. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA INTERVENTION PLUS USUAL CARE COMPARED WITH USUAL CARE ALONE FOR CHRONIC OR RECURRENT LOW BACK PAIN. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN AS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR TREATING CHRONIC OR RECURRENT LOW BACK PAIN. HOWEVER, THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE ON ITS COST-EFFECTIVENESS. THE DATA ARE EXTRACTED FROM A PRAGMATIC, MULTICENTERED, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL THAT HAS BEEN CONDUCTED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF A 12-WEEK PROGRESSIVE PROGRAM OF YOGA PLUS USUAL CARE IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OR RECURRENT LOW BACK PAIN. METHODS: WITH THIS TRIAL DATA, A COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS DURING THE TIME PERIOD OF 12 MONTHS FROM BOTH PERSPECTIVES OF THE UK NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE AND THE SOCIETAL IS PRESENTED. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE IS AN INCREMENTAL COST PER QUALITY-ADJUSTED LIFE-YEAR (QALY). RESULTS: FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE U.K. NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE, YOGA INTERVENTION YIELDS AN INCREMENTAL COST-EFFECTIVENESS RATIO OF POUND13,606 PER QALY. GIVEN A WILLINGNESS TO PAY FOR AN ADDITIONAL QALY OF POUND20,000, THE PROBABILITY OF YOGA INTERVENTION BEING COST-EFFECTIVE IS 72%. FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE SOCIETY, YOGA INTERVENTION IS A DOMINANT TREATMENT COMPARED WITH USUAL CARE ALONE. THIS RESULT IS SURROUNDED BY FEWER UNCERTAINTIES-THE PROBABILITY OF YOGA BEING COST-EFFECTIVE REACHES 95% AT A WILLINGNESS TO PAY FOR AN ADDITIONAL QALY OF POUND20,000. SENSITIVE ANALYSES SUGGEST THE SAME RESULTS THAT YOGA INTERVENTION IS LIKELY TO BE COST-EFFECTIVE IN BOTH PERSPECTIVES. CONCLUSION: ON THE BASIS OF THIS TRIAL, 12 WEEKLY GROUP CLASSES OF SPECIALIZED YOGA ARE LIKELY TO BE A COST-EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR TREATING PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OR RECURRENT LOW BACK PAIN.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
2  131  41 A PRAGMATIC MULTI-CENTRED RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: TRIAL PROTOCOL. UNLABELLED: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REVEALED THREE SMALL RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS OF YOGA FOR LOW BACK PAIN, ALL OF WHICH SHOWED EFFECTS ON BACK PAIN THAT FAVOURED THE YOGA GROUP. TO BUILD ON THESE STUDIES A LARGER TRIAL, WITH LONGER TERM FOLLOW-UP, AND A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT YOGA TEACHERS DELIVERING THE INTERVENTION IS REQUIRED. THIS STUDY PROTOCOL DESCRIBES THE DETAILS OF A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN, WHICH IS FUNDED BY ARTHRITIS RESEARCH CAMPAIGN (ARC) AND IS BEING CONDUCTED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF YORK. 262 PATIENTS WILL BE RECRUITED FROM GP PRACTICES IN 5 CENTRES IN ENGLAND. PATIENTS WILL BE RANDOMISED TO RECEIVE USUAL CARE OR 12 WEEKLY CLASSES OF YOGA. A YOGA PROGRAMME WILL BE DEVISED THAT CAN BE DELIVERED BY YOGA TEACHERS OF THE TWO MAIN NATIONAL YOGA ORGANISATIONS IN THE UK (BRITISH WHEEL OF YOGA AND IYENGAR YOGA ASSOCIATION (UK)).

3 2824  50 YOGA VERSUS EDUCATION FOR VETERANS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: STUDY PROTOCOL FOR A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN IS THE MOST FREQUENT PAIN CONDITION IN VETERANS AND CAUSES SUBSTANTIAL SUFFERING, DECREASED FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY, AND LOWER QUALITY OF LIFE. SYMPTOMS OF POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS, DEPRESSION, AND MILD TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY ARE HIGHLY PREVALENT IN VETERANS WITH BACK PAIN. YOGA FOR LOW BACK PAIN HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR CIVILIANS IN RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. HOWEVER, IT IS UNKNOWN IF RESULTS FROM PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED TRIALS GENERALIZE TO MILITARY POPULATIONS. METHODS/DESIGN: THIS STUDY IS A PARALLEL RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING YOGA TO EDUCATION FOR 120 VETERANS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. PARTICIPANTS ARE VETERANS >/=18 YEARS OLD WITH LOW BACK PAIN PRESENT ON AT LEAST HALF THE DAYS IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS AND A SELF-REPORTED AVERAGE PAIN INTENSITY IN THE PREVIOUS WEEK OF >/=4 ON A 0-10 SCALE. THE 24-WEEK STUDY HAS AN INITIAL 12-WEEK INTERVENTION PERIOD, WHERE PARTICIPANTS ARE RANDOMIZED EQUALLY INTO (1) A STANDARDIZED WEEKLY GROUP YOGA CLASS WITH HOME PRACTICE OR (2) EDUCATION DELIVERED WITH A SELF-CARE BOOK. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES ARE CHANGE AT 12 WEEKS IN LOW BACK PAIN INTENSITY MEASURED BY THE DEFENSE AND VETERANS PAIN RATING SCALE (0-10) AND BACK-RELATED FUNCTION USING THE 23-POINT ROLAND MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE. IN THE SUBSEQUENT 12-WEEK FOLLOW-UP PERIOD, YOGA PARTICIPANTS ARE ENCOURAGED TO CONTINUE HOME YOGA PRACTICE AND EDUCATION PARTICIPANTS CONTINUE FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE BOOK. QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WITH VETERANS IN THE YOGA GROUP AND THEIR PARTNERS EXPLORE THE IMPACT OF CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN AND YOGA ON FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS. WE ALSO ASSESS COST-EFFECTIVENESS FROM THREE PERSPECTIVES: THE VETERAN, THE VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION, AND SOCIETY USING ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS, SELF-REPORTED COST DATA, AND STUDY RECORDS. DISCUSSION: THIS STUDY WILL HELP DETERMINE IF YOGA CAN BECOME AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR VETERANS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL COMORBIDITIES.

4  536  48 COMPARISON OF YOGA VERSUS STRETCHING FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: PROTOCOL FOR THE YOGA EXERCISE SELF-CARE (YES) TRIAL. BACKGROUND: BACK PAIN, ONE OF THE MOST PREVALENT CONDITIONS AFFLICTING AMERICAN ADULTS, IS THE LEADING REASON FOR USING COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE (CAM) THERAPIES. YOGA IS AN INCREASINGLY POPULAR "MIND-BODY" CAM THERAPY OFTEN USED FOR RELIEVING BACK PAIN AND SEVERAL SMALL STUDIES HAVE FOUND YOGA EFFECTIVE FOR THIS CONDITION. THIS STUDY WILL ASSESS WHETHER YOGA IS EFFECTIVE FOR TREATING CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN COMPARED WITH SELF CARE AND EXERCISE AND WILL EXPLORE THE MECHANISMS RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY OBSERVED BENEFITS. METHODS/DESIGN: A TOTAL OF 210 PARTICIPANTS WITH LOW BACK PAIN LASTING AT LEAST 3 MONTHS WILL BE RECRUITED FROM PRIMARY CARE CLINICS OF A LARGE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM BASED IN SEATTLE. THEY WILL BE RANDOMIZED IN A 2:2:1 RATIO TO RECEIVE 12 WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES, 12 WEEKLY CONVENTIONAL THERAPEUTIC EXERCISE CLASSES OF COMPARABLE PHYSICAL EXERTION, OR A SELF-CARE BOOK. INTERVIEWERS MASKED TO PARTICIPANTS' TREATMENT GROUP WILL ASSESS OUTCOMES AT BASELINE AND 6, 12 AND 26 WEEKS AFTER RANDOMIZATION. PRIMARY OUTCOMES WILL BE BACK-RELATED DYSFUNCTION AND SYMPTOM BOTHERSOMENESS. IN ADDITION, DATA WILL BE COLLECTED ON PHYSICAL MEASUREMENTS (E.G., FLEXION) AT BASELINE AND 12 WEEKS AND SALIVA SAMPLES WILL BE OBTAINED AT BASELINE, 6 AND 12 WEEKS. INFORMATION WILL BE COLLECTED ON SPECIFIC PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND PHYSIOLOGICAL FACTORS TO ALLOW EXPLORATION OF POSSIBLE MECHANISMS OF ACTION THROUGH WHICH YOGA COULD RELIEVE BACK PAIN AND DYSFUNCTION. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA WILL BE ASSESSED USING ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE (USING GENERAL ESTIMATING EQUATIONS - GEE) WITHIN AN INTENTION-TO-TREAT CONTEXT. IF YOGA IS FOUND EFFECTIVE, FURTHER ANALYSES WILL EXPLORE WHETHER YOGA'S BENEFITS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL AND/OR PHYSIOLOGICAL FACTORS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY WILL PROVIDE THE CLEAREST EVIDENCE TO DATE ABOUT THE VALUE OF YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC OPTION FOR TREATING CHRONIC BACK PAIN, AND IF THE RESULTS ARE POSITIVE, WILL HELP FOCUS FUTURE, MORE IN-DEPTH, RESEARCH ON THE MOST PROMISING POTENTIAL MECHANISMS OF ACTION IDENTIFIED BY THIS STUDY.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
5 2638  47 YOGA FOR VETERANS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: DESIGN AND METHODS OF A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) AFFLICTS MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WORLDWIDE, WITH PARTICULARLY HIGH PREVALENCE IN MILITARY VETERANS. MANY TREATMENT OPTIONS EXIST FOR CLBP, BUT MOST HAVE LIMITED EFFECTIVENESS AND SOME HAVE SIGNIFICANT SIDE EFFECTS. IN GENERAL POPULATIONS WITH CLBP, YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES WITH FEW SIDE EFFECTS. HOWEVER, YOGA HAS NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY STUDIED IN MILITARY VETERAN POPULATIONS. IN THE CURRENT PAPER WE WILL DESCRIBE THE DESIGN AND METHODS OF A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL AIMED AT EXAMINING WHETHER YOGA CAN EFFECTIVELY REDUCE DISABILITY AND PAIN IN US MILITARY VETERANS WITH CLBP. A TOTAL OF 144 US MILITARY VETERANS WITH CLBP WILL BE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER YOGA OR A DELAYED TREATMENT COMPARISON GROUP. THE YOGA INTERVENTION WILL CONSIST OF 2X WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES FOR 12WEEKS, COMPLEMENTED BY REGULAR HOME PRACTICE GUIDED BY A MANUAL. THE DELAYED TREATMENT GROUP WILL RECEIVE THE SAME INTERVENTION AFTER SIX MONTHS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME IS THE CHANGE IN BACK PAIN-RELATED DISABILITY MEASURED WITH THE ROLAND-MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE AT BASELINE AND 12-WEEKS. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDE PAIN INTENSITY, PAIN INTERFERENCE, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, FATIGUE/ENERGY, QUALITY OF LIFE, SELF-EFFICACY, SLEEP QUALITY, AND MEDICATION USAGE. ADDITIONAL PROCESS AND/OR MEDIATIONAL FACTORS WILL BE MEASURED TO EXAMINE DOSE RESPONSE AND EFFECT MECHANISMS. ASSESSMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED AT BASELINE, 6-WEEKS, 12-WEEKS, AND 6-MONTHS. ALL RANDOMIZED PARTICIPANTS WILL BE INCLUDED IN INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSES. STUDY RESULTS WILL PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED EVIDENCE ON THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC MODALITY FOR THE TREATMENT OF CLBP IN US MILITARY VETERANS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
6  556  56 COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF EARLY INTERVENTIONS FOR NON-SPECIFIC LOW BACK PAIN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY INVESTIGATING MEDICAL YOGA, EXERCISE THERAPY AND SELF-CARE ADVICE. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS OF MEDICAL YOGA AS AN EARLY INTERVENTION COMPARED WITH EVIDENCE-BASED EXERCISE THERAPY AND SELF-CARE ADVICE FOR NON-SPECIFIC LOW BACK PAIN. DESIGN: RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH A COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS. SUBJECTS: A TOTAL OF 159 PARTICIPANTS RANDOMIZED INTO THE MEDICAL YOGA GROUP (N = 52), THE EXERCISE THERAPY GROUP (N = 52) AND THE SELF-CARE ADVICE GROUP (N = 55). METHODS: THE HEALTH OUTCOME MEASURE EQ-5D WAS APPLIED TO MEASURE QUALITY OF LIFE DATA COMBINED WITH COST DATA COLLECTED FROM TREATMENT GROUPS FROM BASELINE TO 12 MONTHS FOLLOW-UP. OUTCOME MEASURE WAS HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQL). INCREMENTAL COST PER QUALITY ADJUSTED LIFE YEAR (QALY) WAS ALSO CALCULATED. COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED PRIMARILY FROM THE SOCIETAL AND EMPLOYER PERSPECTIVES. RESULTS: MEDICAL YOGA IS COST-EFFECTIVE COMPARED WITH SELF-CARE ADVICE IF AN EMPLOYER CONSIDERS THE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE HRQL OF AN EMPLOYEE WITH LOW BACK PAIN JUSTIFIES THE ADDITIONAL COST OF TREATMENT (I.E. IN THIS STUDY EUR 150). FROM A SOCIETAL PERSPECTIVE, MEDICAL YOGA IS A COST-EFFECTIVE TREATMENT COMPARED WITH EXERCISE THERAPY AND SELF-CARE ADVICE IF AN ADDITIONAL QALY IS WORTH EUR 11,500. SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT MEDICAL YOGA IS MORE COST-EFFECTIVE THAN ITS ALTERNATIVES. CONCLUSION: SIX WEEKS OF UNINTERRUPTED MEDICAL YOGA THERA-PY IS A COST-EFFECTIVE EARLY INTERVENTION FOR NON-SPECIFIC LOW BACK PAIN, WHEN TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ADHERED TO.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
7  162  51 A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: RESULTS OF A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO CONDUCT A PILOT TRIAL OF YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (LBP) TO INFORM THE FEASIBILITY AND PRACTICALITY OF CONDUCTING A FULL-SCALE TRIAL IN THE UK; AND TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. DESIGN: A PRAGMATIC RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS UNDERTAKEN COMPARING YOGA TO USUAL CARE. PARTICIPANTS: TWENTY PARTICIPANTS WHO HAD PRESENTED TO THEIR GP WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN IN THE PREVIOUS 18 MONTHS WERE RECRUITED VIA GP RECORDS FROM ONE PRACTICE IN YORK, UK. INTERVENTIONS: TWENTY PATIENTS WERE RANDOMISED TO EITHER 12 WEEKLY 75-MIN SESSIONS OF SPECIALISED YOGA PLUS WRITTEN ADVICE, OR USUAL CARE PLUS WRITTEN ADVICE. ALLOCATION WAS 50/50. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: RECRUITMENT RATE, LEVELS OF INTERVENTION ATTENDANCE, AND LOSS TO FOLLOW-UP WERE THE MAIN NON-CLINICAL OUTCOMES. CHANGE AS MEASURED BY THE ROLAND AND MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE WAS THE PRIMARY CLINICAL OUTCOME. CHANGES IN THE ABERDEEN BACK PAIN SCALE, SF-12, EQ-5D, AND PAIN SELF-EFFICACY WERE SECONDARY CLINICAL OUTCOMES. DATA WERE COLLECTED VIA POSTAL QUESTIONNAIRE AT BASELINE, 4 WEEKS, AND 12 WEEKS FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: OF THE 286 PATIENTS IDENTIFIED FROM THE GP DATABASE, 52 (18%) CONSENTED AND RETURNED THE ELIGIBILITY QUESTIONNAIRE, OUT OF THESE 20 (6.9%) WERE ELIGIBLE AND RANDOMISED. THE TOTAL PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS RANDOMISED FROM THE GP PRACTICE POPULATION WAS 0.28%. TEN PATIENTS WERE RANDOMISED TO YOGA, RECEIVING AN AVERAGE OF 1.7 SESSIONS (RANGE 0-5), AND 10 WERE RANDOMISED TO USUAL CARE. AT 12 WEEKS FOLLOW-UP DATA WAS RECEIVED FROM 60% OF PATIENTS IN THE YOGA GROUP AND 90% OF PATIENTS IN THE USUAL CARE GROUP (75% OVERALL). NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE SEEN BETWEEN GROUPS IN CLINICAL OUTCOMES APART FROM ON THE ABERDEEN BACK PAIN SCALE AT FOUR WEEKS FOLLOW-UP WHERE THE YOGA GROUP REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY LESS PAIN. CONCLUSION: THIS PILOT STUDY PROVIDED USEFUL DATA AND INFORMATION TO INFORM THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF A FULL-SCALE TRIAL OF YOGA FOR CLBP IN THE UK. A KEY FINDING IS THE CALCULATION OF GP PRACTICE TOTAL LIST SIZE REQUIRED FOR PATIENT RECRUITMENT IN A FULL-SCALE TRIAL, AND THE NEED TO IMPLEMENT METHODS TO INCREASE CLASS ATTENDANCE.	2010	
                                                                                                              
8 1953  48 SECONDARY OUTCOMES FROM A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA FOR VETERANS WITH CHRONIC LOW-BACK PAIN. CHRONIC LOW-BACK PAIN (CLBP) IS A PREVALENT CONDITION, AND RATES ARE HIGHER AMONG MILITARY VETERANS. CLBP IS A PERSISTENT CONDITION, AND TREATMENT OPTIONS HAVE EITHER MODEST EFFECTS OR A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF SIDE-EFFECTS, WHICH HAS LED TO RECENT EFFORTS TO EXPLORE MIND-BODY INTERVENTION OPTIONS AND REDUCE OPIOID MEDICATION USE. PRIOR STUDIES OF YOGA FOR CLBP IN COMMUNITY SAMPLES, AND THE MAIN RESULTS OF A RECENT TRIAL WITH MILITARY VETERANS, INDICATE THAT YOGA CAN REDUCE BACK-RELATED DISABILITY AND PAIN INTENSITY. SECONDARY OUTCOMES FROM THE TRIAL OF YOGA WITH MILITARY VETERANS ARE PRESENTED HERE. IN THE STUDY, 150 MILITARY VETERANS (VETERANS ADMINISTRATION PATIENTS) WITH CLBP WERE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER YOGA OR A DELAYED-TREATMENT GROUP RECEIVING USUAL CARE BETWEEN 2013 AND 2015. ASSESSMENTS OCCURRED AT BASELINE, 6 WEEKS, 12 WEEKS, AND 6 MONTHS. INTENT-TO-TREAT ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED. YOGA CLASSES LASTING 60 MINUTES EACH WERE OFFERED TWICE WEEKLY FOR 12 WEEKS. YOGA SESSIONS CONSISTED OF PHYSICAL POSTURES, MOVEMENT, FOCUSED ATTENTION, AND BREATHING TECHNIQUES. HOME PRACTICE GUIDED BY A MANUAL WAS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS ROLAND-MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE SCORES AFTER 12 WEEKS. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED PAIN INTENSITY, PAIN INTERFERENCE, DEPRESSION, FATIGUE, QUALITY OF LIFE, SELF-EFFICACY, AND MEDICATION USAGE. YOGA PARTICIPANTS IMPROVED MORE THAN DELAYED-TREATMENT PARTICIPANTS ON PAIN INTERFERENCE, FATIGUE, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND SELF-EFFICACY AT 12 WEEKS AND/OR 6 MONTHS. YOGA PARTICIPANTS HAD GREATER IMPROVEMENTS ACROSS A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT SECONDARY HEALTH OUTCOMES COMPARED TO CONTROLS.

9 2589  39 YOGA FOR LOW BACK PAIN: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS. IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT YOGA HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON LOW BACK PAIN AND FUNCTION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AS A TREATMENT OPTION FOR LOW BACK PAIN. SEVEN DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FROM THEIR INCEPTION TO MARCH 2011. RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS WERE CONSIDERED IF THEY INVESTIGATED YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH LOW BACK PAIN AND IF THEY ASSESSED PAIN AS AN OUTCOME MEASURE. THE SELECTION OF STUDIES, DATA EXTRACTION AND VALIDATION WERE PERFORMED INDEPENDENTLY BY TWO REVIEWERS. SEVEN RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS (RCTS) MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. THEIR METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY RANGED BETWEEN 2 AND 4 ON THE JADAD SCALE. FIVE RCTS SUGGESTED THAT YOGA LEADS TO A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER REDUCTION IN LOW BACK PAIN THAN USUAL CARE, EDUCATION OR CONVENTIONAL THERAPEUTIC EXERCISES. TWO RCTS SHOWED NO BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCES. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT YOGA HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ALLEVIATE LOW BACK PAIN. HOWEVER, ANY DEFINITIVE CLAIMS SHOULD BE TREATED WITH CAUTION.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
10 2598  49 YOGA FOR OLDER ADULTS WITH MULTIMORBIDITY (THE GENTLE YEARS YOGA TRIAL): STUDY PROTOCOL FOR A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: MULTIMORBIDITY IS COMMON IN OLDER ADULTS AND ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH LEVELS OF ILLNESS BURDEN AND HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURE. THE EVIDENCE BASE FOR HOW TO MANAGE OLDER ADULTS WITH MULTIMORBIDITY IS WEAK. YOGA MIGHT BE A USEFUL INTERVENTION BECAUSE IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING, AND SEVERAL MEDICAL CONDITIONS. THE BRITISH WHEEL OF YOGA'S GENTLE YEARS YOGA(C) (GYY) PROGRAMME WAS DEVELOPED SPECIFICALLY FOR OLDER ADULTS, INCLUDING THOSE WITH CHRONIC MEDICAL CONDITIONS. DATA FROM A PILOT TRIAL SUGGESTED FEASIBILITY OF USING GYY IN THIS POPULATION, BUT ITS EFFECTIVENESS AND COST-EFFECTIVENESS REMAIN UNCERTAIN. METHODS: THIS IS A MULTI-SITE, INDIVIDUALLY RANDOMISED, SUPERIORITY TRIAL WITH AN EMBEDDED PROCESS EVALUATION AND AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF COST-EFFECTIVENESS. THE TRIAL WILL COMPARE AN EXPERIMENTAL STRATEGY OF OFFERING A 12-WEEK GYY PROGRAMME AGAINST A CONTROL STRATEGY OF NO OFFER IN COMMUNITY-DWELLING ADULTS AGED 65 OR OVER WHO HAVE MULTIMORBIDITY, DEFINED AS HAVING TWO OR MORE CHRONIC CONDITIONS FROM A PREDEFINED LIST. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME IS HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE MEASURED USING THE EQ-5D-5L, THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT BEING THE OVERALL DIFFERENCE OVER 12 MONTHS. BOTH GROUPS WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THEIR USUAL CARE FROM PRIMARY, SECONDARY, COMMUNITY, AND SOCIAL SERVICES. PARTICIPANTS, CARE PROVIDERS, AND YOGA TEACHERS WILL NOT BE BLINDED TO THE ALLOCATED INTERVENTION. OUTCOME MEASURES ARE PRIMARILY SELF-REPORTED. THE ANALYSIS WILL FOLLOW INTENTION-TO-TREAT PRINCIPLES. DISCUSSION: THIS PRAGMATIC RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL WILL DEMONSTRATE IF THE GYY PROGRAMME IS AN EFFECTIVE, COST-EFFECTIVE, AND VIABLE ADDITION TO THE MANAGEMENT OF OLDER ADULTS WITH MULTIMORBIDITY.

11 2831  44 YOGA VS. PHYSICAL THERAPY VS. EDUCATION FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN IN PREDOMINANTLY MINORITY POPULATIONS: STUDY PROTOCOL FOR A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN CAUSES SUBSTANTIAL MORBIDITY AND COST TO SOCIETY WHILE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTING LOW-INCOME AND MINORITY ADULTS. SEVERAL RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS SHOW YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT. HOWEVER, THE COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AND PHYSICAL THERAPY, A COMMON MAINSTREAM TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN, IS UNKNOWN. METHODS/DESIGN: THIS IS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL FOR 320 PREDOMINANTLY LOW-INCOME MINORITY ADULTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN, COMPARING YOGA, PHYSICAL THERAPY, AND EDUCATION. INCLUSION CRITERIA ARE ADULTS 18-64 YEARS OLD WITH NON-SPECIFIC LOW BACK PAIN LASTING >/= 12 WEEKS AND A SELF-REPORTED AVERAGE PAIN INTENSITY OF >/= 4 ON A 0-10 SCALE. RECRUITMENT TAKES PLACE AT BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER, AN URBAN ACADEMIC SAFETY-NET HOSPITAL AND SEVEN FEDERALLY QUALIFIED COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS LOCATED IN DIVERSE NEIGHBORHOODS. THE 52-WEEK STUDY HAS AN INITIAL 12-WEEK TREATMENT PHASE WHERE PARTICIPANTS ARE RANDOMIZED IN A 2:2:1 RATIO INTO I) A STANDARDIZED WEEKLY HATHA YOGA CLASS SUPPLEMENTED BY HOME PRACTICE; II) A STANDARDIZED EVIDENCE-BASED EXERCISE THERAPY PROTOCOL ADAPTED FROM THE TREATMENT BASED CLASSIFICATION METHOD, INDIVIDUALLY DELIVERED BY A PHYSICAL THERAPIST AND SUPPLEMENTED BY HOME PRACTICE; AND III) EDUCATION DELIVERED THROUGH A SELF-CARE BOOK. CO-PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES ARE 12-WEEK PAIN INTENSITY MEASURED ON AN 11-POINT NUMERICAL RATING SCALE AND BACK-SPECIFIC FUNCTION MEASURED USING THE MODIFIED ROLAND MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE. IN THE SUBSEQUENT 40-WEEK MAINTENANCE PHASE, YOGA PARTICIPANTS ARE RE-RANDOMIZED IN A 1:1 RATIO TO EITHER STRUCTURED MAINTENANCE YOGA CLASSES OR HOME PRACTICE ONLY. PHYSICAL THERAPY PARTICIPANTS ARE SIMILARLY RE-RANDOMIZED TO EITHER FIVE BOOSTER SESSIONS OR HOME PRACTICE ONLY. EDUCATION PARTICIPANTS CONTINUE TO FOLLOW RECOMMENDATIONS OF EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS. WE WILL ALSO ASSESS COST EFFECTIVENESS FROM THE PERSPECTIVES OF THE INDIVIDUAL, INSURERS, AND SOCIETY USING CLAIMS DATABASES, ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS, SELF-REPORT COST DATA, AND STUDY RECORDS. QUALITATIVE DATA FROM INTERVIEWS WILL ADD SUBJECTIVE DETAIL TO COMPLEMENT QUANTITATIVE DATA. TRIAL REGISTRATION: THIS TRIAL IS REGISTERED IN CLINICALTRIALS.GOV, WITH THE ID NUMBER: NCT01343927.	2014	

12  793  40 EFFECT OF YOGA IN THE THERAPY OF IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. BACKGROUND & AIMS: THIS REVIEW AIMS TO SYSTEMATICALLY SURVEY THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SYMPTOMS OF IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME (IBS), PAIN, QUALITY OF LIFE, MOOD, STRESS, AND SAFETY IN PATIENTS WITH IBS. METHODS: MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, CAM-QUEST, CAMBASE, AND INDMED WERE SCREENED THROUGH NOVEMBER 2015. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS COMPARING YOGA WITH USUAL CARE, NONPHARMACOLOGIC, OR PHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS WERE ANALYZED FOR PATIENTS WITH IBS. PRIMARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND PAIN. ANXIETY, MOOD, AND SAFETY WERE DEFINED AS SECONDARY OUTCOMES. RISK OF BIAS WAS ASSESSED ACCORDING TO THE COCHRANE COLLABORATION RECOMMENDATIONS. RESULTS: SIX RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WITH A TOTAL OF 273 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS. THERE WAS EVIDENCE FOR A BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF A YOGIC INTERVENTION OVER CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT IN IBS, WITH SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED BOWEL SYMPTOMS, IBS SEVERITY, AND ANXIETY. FURTHERMORE, THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN QUALITY OF LIFE, GLOBAL IMPROVEMENT, AND PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING AFTER YOGA COMPARED WITH NO TREATMENT. TWO RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS REPORTED SAFETY DATA STATING THAT NO ADVERSE EVENTS OCCURRED. OVERALL, RISK OF BIAS OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES WAS UNCLEAR. CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW SUGGEST THAT YOGA MIGHT BE A FEASIBLE AND SAFE ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT FOR PEOPLE WITH IBS. NEVERTHELESS, NO RECOMMENDATION CAN BE MADE REGARDING YOGA AS A ROUTINE INTERVENTION FOR PATIENTS WITH IBS BECAUSE OF MAJOR FLAWS IN STUDY METHODS. MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED WITH RESPECT TO A HIGH-QUALITY STUDY DESIGN AND CONSENSUS IN CLINICAL OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS IN IBS.

13  912  44 EFFECTIVENESS OF IYENGAR YOGA IN TREATING SPINAL (BACK AND NECK) PAIN: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY SPENT IN HEALTH CARE IS USED FOR TREATMENTS OF LIFESTYLE RELATED, CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS, WHICH COME FROM BEHAVIORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY OF THE POPULATION. BACK AND NECK PAIN ARE TWO OF THE MOST COMMON MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS IN MODERN SOCIETY THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT COST IN HEALTH CARE. YOGA, AS A BRANCH OF COMPLEMENTARY ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE, HAS EMERGED AND IS SHOWING TO BE AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT AGAINST NONSPECIFIC SPINAL PAIN. RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN POSITIVE OUTCOME OF YOGA IN GENERAL ON REDUCING PAIN AND FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY OF THE SPINE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO CONDUCT A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE EXISTING RESEARCH WITHIN IYENGAR YOGA METHOD AND ITS EFFECTIVENESS ON RELIEVING BACK AND NECK PAIN (DEFINED AS SPINAL PAIN). DATABASE RESEARCH FORM THE FOLLOWING SOURCES (COCHRANE LIBRARY, NCBI PUBMED, THE CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRY OF THE INDIAN COUNCIL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH, GOOGLE SCHOLAR, EMBASE, CINAHL, AND PSYCHINFO) DEMONSTRATED INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA THAT SELECTED ONLY IYENGAR YOGA INTERVENTIONS, WHICH IN TURN, IDENTIFIED SIX RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS DEDICATED TO COMPARE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR BACK AND NECK PAIN VERSUS OTHER CARE. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GROUPS ON THE POSTINTERVENTION PAIN OR FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY INTENSITY ASSESSMENT WAS, IN ALL SIX STUDIES, FAVORING THE YOGA GROUP, WHICH PROJECTED A DECREASE IN BACK AND NECK PAIN. OVERALL SIX STUDIES WITH 570 PATIENTS SHOWED, THAT IYENGAR YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE MEANS FOR BOTH BACK AND NECK PAIN IN COMPARISON TO CONTROL GROUPS. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW FOUND STRONG EVIDENCE FOR SHORT-TERM EFFECTIVENESS, BUT LITTLE EVIDENCE FOR LONG-TERM EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR CHRONIC SPINE PAIN IN THE PATIENT-CENTERED OUTCOMES.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
14 1516  31 IS YOGA AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN COMPARED WITH OTHER CARE MODALITIES - A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO ASSESS RANDOMIZED-CONTROL TRIALS (RCTS) TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) COMPARED WITH OTHER CARE MODALITIES. METHODS: A SEARCH STRATEGY WAS FORMULATED WITH KEY CONCEPTS IDENTIFIED USING THE PICO PROCESS. FOUR DATABASES WERE SEARCHED IN JUNE 2012. APPROPRIATE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA WERE SET AND IMPLEMENTED. RESULTS: FOUR RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. ALL FOUR PAPERS FOUND THAT YOGA LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN BACK FUNCTION, AND THREE DEMONSTRATED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN BACK PAIN WHEN COMPARED WITH CERTAIN CARE MODALITIES. ALL PAPERS HAD SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS IDENTIFIED, HOWEVER. CONCLUSIONS: GIVEN THE LIMITATIONS IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE STUDIES, THE CONCLUSIONS DRAWN MUST BE CONSIDERED CONSERVATIVELY. ALTHOUGH EARLY RESULTS APPEAR PROMISING, BUT FURTHER WELL-DESIGNED RCTS ARE WARRANTED, WITH MULTIPLE, SPECIFIED COMPARATOR CARE MODALITIES BEFORE FIRM CONCLUSIONS CAN BE GAINED.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
15 2573  42 YOGA FOR ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS THOUGHT TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR HEALTH CONDITIONS. THE ARTICLE AIMS TO ASSESS THE CURRENT CLINICAL EVIDENCE OF YOGA FOR ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION (EH). STRATEGY: MEDLINE, EMBASE, AND THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL) IN THE COCHRANE LIBRARY WERE SEARCHED UNTIL JUNE, 2013. WE INCLUDED RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS TESTING YOGA AGAINST CONVENTIONAL THERAPY, YOGA VERSUS NO TREATMENT, YOGA COMBINED WITH CONVENTIONAL THERAPY VERSUS CONVENTIONAL THERAPY OR CONVENTIONAL THERAPY COMBINED WITH BREATH AWARENESS. STUDY SELECTION, DATA EXTRACTION, QUALITY ASSESSMENT, AND DATA ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED ACCORDING TO THE COCHRANE STANDARDS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 6 STUDIES (INVOLVING 386 PATIENTS) WERE INCLUDED. THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF THE INCLUDED TRIALS WAS EVALUATED AS GENERALLY LOW. A TOTAL OF 6 RCTS MET ALL THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. 4 OF THEM COMPARED YOGA PLUS CONVENTIONAL THERAPY WITH CONVENTIONAL THERAPY. 1 RCT DESCRIBED YOGA COMBINED WITH CONVENTIONAL THERAPY VERSUS CONVENTIONAL THERAPY COMBINED WITH BREATH AWARENESS. 2 RCT TESTED THE EFFECT OF YOGA VERSUS CONVENTIONAL THERAPY ALONE. 1 RCT DESCRIBED YOGA COMPARED TO NO TREATMENT. ONLY ONE TRIAL REPORTED ADVERSE EVENTS WITHOUT DETAILS, THE SAFETY OF YOGA IS STILL UNCERTAIN. CONCLUSIONS: THERE IS SOME ENCOURAGING EVIDENCE OF YOGA FOR LOWERING SBP AND DBP. HOWEVER, DUE TO LOW METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF THESE IDENTIFIED TRIALS, A DEFINITE CONCLUSION ABOUT THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF YOGA ON EH CANNOT BE DRAWN FROM THIS REVIEW. THEREFORE, FURTHER THOROUGH INVESTIGATION, LARGE-SCALE, PROPER STUDY DESIGNED, RANDOMIZED TRIALS OF YOGA FOR HYPERTENSION WILL BE REQUIRED TO JUSTIFY THE EFFECTS REPORTED HERE.	2013

17 1044  32 EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON PAIN AND PAIN-ASSOCIATED DISABILITY: A META-ANALYSIS. UNLABELLED: WE SEARCHED DATABASES FOR CONTROLLED CLINICAL STUDIES, AND PERFORMED A META-ANALYSIS ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON PAIN AND ASSOCIATED DISABILITY. FIVE RANDOMIZED STUDIES REPORTED SINGLE-BLINDING AND HAD A HIGHER METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY; 7 STUDIES WERE RANDOMIZED BUT NOT BLINDED AND HAD MODERATE QUALITY; AND 4 NONRANDOMIZED STUDIES HAD LOW QUALITY. IN 6 STUDIES, YOGA WAS USED TO TREAT PATIENTS WITH BACK PAIN; IN 2 STUDIES TO TREAT RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS; IN 2 STUDIES TO TREAT PATIENTS WITH HEADACHE/MIGRAINE; AND 6 STUDIES ENROLLED INDIVIDUALS FOR OTHER INDICATIONS. ALL STUDIES REPORTED POSITIVE EFFECTS IN FAVOR OF THE YOGA INTERVENTIONS. WITH RESPECT TO PAIN, A RANDOM EFFECT META-ANALYSIS ESTIMATED THE OVERALL TREATMENT EFFECT AT SMD = -.74 (CI: -.97; -.52, P < .0001), AND AN OVERALL TREATMENT EFFECT AT SMD = -.79 (CI: -1.02; -.56, P < .0001) FOR PAIN-RELATED DISABILITY. DESPITE SOME LIMITATIONS, THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT YOGA MAY BE USEFUL FOR SEVERAL PAIN-ASSOCIATED DISORDERS. MOREOVER, THERE ARE HINTS THAT EVEN SHORT-TERM INTERVENTIONS MIGHT BE EFFECTIVE. NEVERTHELESS, LARGE-SCALE FURTHER STUDIES HAVE TO IDENTIFY WHICH PATIENTS MAY BENEFIT FROM THE RESPECTIVE INTERVENTIONS. PERSPECTIVE: THIS META-ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT YOGA IS A USEFUL SUPPLEMENTARY APPROACH WITH MODERATE EFFECT SIZES ON PAIN AND ASSOCIATED DISABILITY.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
18 1291  34 GROUP ACUPUNCTURE THERAPY WITH YOGA THERAPY FOR CHRONIC NECK, LOW BACK, AND OSTEOARTHRITIS PAIN IN SAFETY NET SETTING FOR AN UNDERSERVED POPULATION: DESIGN AND RATIONALE FOR A FEASIBILITY PILOT. CHRONIC PAIN IS PREVALENT IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH IMPACT ON PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONING AS WELL AS LOST WORK PRODUCTIVITY. MINORITY AND LOWER SOCIOECONOMIC POPULATIONS HAVE INCREASED PREVALENCE OF CHRONIC PAIN WITH LESS ACCESS TO PAIN CARE, POORER OUTCOMES, AND HIGHER RISK OF FATAL OPIOID OVERDOSE. ACUPUNCTURE THERAPY IS EFFECTIVE IN TREATING CHRONIC PAIN CONDITIONS INCLUDING CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN, NECK PAIN, SHOULDER PAIN, AND KNEE PAIN FROM OSTEOARTHRITIS. ACUPUNCTURE THERAPY, INCLUDING GROUP ACUPUNCTURE, IS FEASIBLE AND EFFECTIVE, AND SPECIFICALLY SO FOR UNDERSERVED AND DIVERSE POPULATIONS AT RISK FOR HEALTH OUTCOME DISPARITIES. ACUPUNCTURE THERAPY ALSO ENCOURAGES PATIENT ENGAGEMENT AND ACTIVATION. AS CHRONIC PAIN IMPROVES, THERE IS A NATURAL PROGRESSION TO WANT AND NEED TO INCREASE ACTIVITY AND MOVEMENT RECOVERY. DIVERSE MOVEMENT APPROACHES ARE IMPORTANT FOR IMPROVING RANGE OF MOTION, MAINTAINING GAINS, STRENGTHENING, AND PROMOTING PATIENT ENGAGEMENT AND ACTIVATION. YOGA THERAPY IS AN ACTIVE THERAPY WITH PROVEN BENEFIT IN MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN DISORDERS AND PAIN ASSOCIATED DISABILITY. THE AIM OF THIS QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL PILOT FEASIBILITY TRIAL IS TO TEST THE BUNDLING OF THESE 2 EFFECTIVE CARE OPTIONS FOR CHRONIC PAIN, TO INFORM BOTH THE DESIGN FOR A LARGER RANDOMIZED PRAGMATIC EFFECTIVENESS TRIAL AS WELL AS IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES ACROSS UNDERSERVED SETTINGS.	2020

20 2609  50 YOGA FOR QUALITY OF LIFE IN INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC DISEASE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC DISEASES, INCLUDING HEART DISEASE, STROKE, CANCER, AND CHRONIC PULMONARY DISEASE ARE THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH AND DISABILITY WORLDWIDE. COMPOUNDING SYMPTOMS AND LOSS OF FUNCTION, PEOPLE LIVING WITH CHRONIC DISEASE OFTEN EXPERIENCE REDUCED QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). VARIOUS PHYSICAL AND MENTAL PRACTICES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO RELIEVE STRESS AND IMPROVE QOL. YOGA IS A PHYSICAL AND MENTAL PRACTICE THAT MAY BE A VIABLE APPROACH FOR IMPROVING QOL IN PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC DISEASE. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE AND SUMMARIZE THE EVIDENCE FOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA ON QOL IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC DISEASE. DESIGN: THE STUDY DESIGN WAS A A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WITH QUALITATIVE SYNTHESIS. METHODS: WE INCLUDED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS THAT EVALUATED THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON QOL OR HEALTH-RELATED QOL (HRQOL) FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC DISEASE. WE INCLUDED ONLY STUDIES THAT USED AT LEAST 1 PREVIOUSLY VALIDATED MEASURE OF QOL OR HRQOL AND SPECIFIED A MINIMUM DURATION OF FOLLOW-UP OF AT LEAST 1 WK. INTERVENTIONS: WE INCLUDED BOTH MOVEMENT-BASED AND BREATH-BASED YOGA PRACTICES. STUDIES THAT INCLUDED YOGA AS PART OF A LARGER INTERVENTION PROGRAM (EG, MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION TRAINING) OR STUDIES THAT DID NOT PROVIDE FINDINGS SPECIFIC TO YOGA WERE EXCLUDED. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: THE PRIMARY OUTCOME ANALYZED WAS IMPROVEMENT IN QOL AS MEASURED BY A VALIDATED QOL OR HRQOL SCALE. RESULTS: AMONG THE 1488 STUDIES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED ON INITIAL SEARCH, 7 ARTICLES MET ALL INCLUSION CRITERIA. FIVE STUDIES REPORTED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE OVER USUAL CARE ALONE FOR IMPROVEMENT OF QOL IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC DISEASE, BUT THE CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DIFFERENCES WAS CLEAR IN ONLY 1 TRIAL. WE FOUND CONSIDERABLE HETEROGENEITY AMONG THE INCLUDED STUDIES AND STUDY QUALITY WAS GENERALLY LOW. CONCLUSIONS: MORE HIGH-QUALITY RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE VALUE OF YOGA AS AN ADJUNCTIVE APPROACH TO IMPROVING QOL IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC DISEASE.	2019

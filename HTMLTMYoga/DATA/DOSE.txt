1  168 133 A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED DOSING STUDY OF IYENGAR YOGA AND COHERENT BREATHING FOR THE TREATMENT OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER: IMPACT ON SUICIDAL IDEATION AND SAFETY FINDINGS. BACKGROUND: YOGA INTERVENTIONS OFFER PROMISE FOR THE TREATMENT OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD), YET THEIR SAFETY AND POTENTIAL IMPACT ON SUICIDAL IDEATION (SI) HAVE NOT BEEN WELL DOCUMENTED. THIS STUDY EVALUATED THE SAFETY OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED DOSE-FINDING TRIAL OF IYENGAR YOGA PLUS COHERENT BREATHING FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH MDD, AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF THE INTERVENTION ON SI WITHOUT INTENT. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WITH BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY-II (BDI-II) SCORES >/=14 AND A DIAGNOSIS OF MDD (USING DSM-IV CRITERIA) WERE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER A LOW DOSE GROUP (LDG) OR HIGH DOSE GROUP (HDG) AND RECEIVED A 12-WEEK MANUALIZED INTERVENTION. THE LDG INCLUDED TWO 90-MIN YOGA CLASSES PLUS THREE 30-MIN HOMEWORK SESSIONS WEEKLY. THE HDG OFFERED THREE 90-MIN CLASSES PLUS FOUR 30-MIN HOMEWORK SESSIONS WEEKLY. RESULTS: THIRTY-TWO INDIVIDUALS WITH MDD WERE RANDOMIZED, OF WHICH 30 COMPLETED THE PROTOCOL. AT SCREENING, SI WITHOUT INTENT WAS ENDORSED ON THE BDI-II BY 9 PARTICIPANTS; AFTER COMPLETING THE INTERVENTION, 8 OUT OF 9 REPORTED RESOLUTION OF SI. THERE WERE 17 ADVERSE EVENTS POSSIBLY-RELATED AND 15 DEFINITELY-RELATED TO THE INTERVENTION. THE MOST COMMON PROTOCOL-RELATED ADVERSE EVENT WAS MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN, WHICH RESOLVED OVER THE COURSE OF THE STUDY. CONCLUSIONS: THE IYENGAR YOGA PLUS COHERENT BREATHING INTERVENTION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RESOLUTION OF SI IN 8 OUT OF 9 PARTICIPANTS, WITH MILD SIDE EFFECTS THAT WERE PRIMARILY MUSCULOSKELETAL IN NATURE. THIS PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THIS INTERVENTION MAY REDUCE SI WITHOUT INTENT AND BE SAFE FOR USE IN THOSE WITH MDD.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
2 2325  56 TREATMENT OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER WITH IYENGAR YOGA AND COHERENT BREATHING: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED DOSING STUDY. OBJECTIVES: THE AIMS OF THIS STUDY WERE TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF AN INTERVENTION OF IYENGAR YOGA AND COHERENT BREATHING AT FIVE BREATHS PER MINUTE ON DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND TO DETERMINE OPTIMAL INTERVENTION YOGA DOSING FOR FUTURE STUDIES IN INDIVIDUALS WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD). METHODS: SUBJECTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO THE HIGH-DOSE GROUP (HDG) OR LOW-DOSE GROUP (LDG) FOR A 12-WEEK INTERVENTION OF THREE OR TWO INTERVENTION CLASSES PER WEEK, RESPECTIVELY. ELIGIBLE SUBJECTS WERE 18-64 YEARS OLD WITH MDD, HAD BASELINE BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY-II (BDI-II) SCORES >/=14, AND WERE EITHER ON NO ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATIONS OR ON A STABLE DOSE OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS FOR >/=3 MONTHS. THE INTERVENTION INCLUDED 90-MIN CLASSES PLUS HOMEWORK. OUTCOME MEASURES WERE BDI-II SCORES AND INTERVENTION COMPLIANCE. RESULTS: FIFTEEN HDG (MAGE = 38.4 +/- 15.1 YEARS) AND 15 LDG (MAGE = 34.7 +/- 10.4 YEARS) SUBJECTS COMPLETED THE INTERVENTION. BDI-II SCORES AT SCREENING AND COMPLIANCE DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN GROUPS (P = 0.26). BDI-II SCORES DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM SCREENING (24.6 +/- 1.7) TO WEEK 12 (6.0 +/- 3.8) FOR THE HDG (-18.6 +/- 6.6; P < 0.001), AND FROM SCREENING (27.7 +/- 2.1) TO WEEK 12 (10.1 +/- 7.9) IN THE LDG (-17.7 +/- 9.3; P < 0.001). THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS, BASED ON RESPONSE (I.E., >50% DECREASE IN BDI-II SCORES; P = 0.65) FOR THE HDG (13/15 SUBJECTS) AND LDG (11/15 SUBJECTS) OR REMISSION (I.E., NUMBER OF SUBJECTS WITH BDI-II SCORES <14; P = 1.00) FOR THE HDG (14/15 SUBJECTS) AND LDG (13/15 SUBJECTS) AFTER THE 12-WEEK INTERVENTION, ALTHOUGH A GREATER NUMBER OF SUBJECTS IN THE HDG HAD 12-WEEK BDI-II SCORES </=10 (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: DURING THIS 12-WEEK INTERVENTION OF YOGA PLUS COHERENT BREATHING, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY IN PATIENTS WITH MDD IN BOTH THE HDG AND LDG. BOTH GROUPS SHOWED COMPARABLE COMPLIANCE AND CLINICAL IMPROVEMENTS, WITH MORE SUBJECTS IN THE HDG EXHIBITING BDI-II SCORES </=10 AT WEEK 12.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
3 1831  57 PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION, IYENGAR YOGA, AND COHERENT BREATHING: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED DOSING STUDY. BACKGROUND: EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD). STUDIES EVALUATING THE "DOSING" OF YOGA TREATMENT AND EFFICACY FOR MDD ARE NEEDED. THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF AN INTERVENTION COMBINING IYENGAR YOGA AND COHERENT BREATHING IN PARTICIPANTS WITH MDD AND DETERMINE THE OPTIMAL INTERVENTION DOSE. METHODS: THIRTY-TWO PARTICIPANTS (18 TO 65 Y OF AGE) DIAGNOSED WITH MDD WERE RANDOMIZED TO A HIGH-DOSE GROUP (HDG) OR A LOW-DOSE GROUP (LDG) OF YOGA AND COHERENT BREATHING FOR 12 WEEKS. THE HDG (N=15) INVOLVED THREE 90-MINUTE YOGA CLASSES AND FOUR 30-MINUTE HOMEWORK SESSIONS PER WEEK. THE LDG (N=15) INVOLVED TWO 90-MINUTE YOGA CLASSES AND THREE 30-MINUTE HOMEWORK SESSIONS PER WEEK. PARTICIPANTS WERE EVALUATED AT BASELINE, WEEK 4, WEEK 8, AND WEEK 12 WITH THE FOLLOWING INSTRUMENTS: POSITIVITY SELF-TEST, SPIELBERGER STATE ANXIETY INVENTORY, PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE-9, PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX, AND EXERCISE-INDUCED FEELING INVENTORY. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING INTENT-TO-TREAT METHODS. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN ALL OUTCOME MEASURES WERE FOUND FOR BOTH GROUPS, WITH ACUTE AND CUMULATIVE BENEFITS. ALTHOUGH THE HDG SHOWED GREATER IMPROVEMENTS ON ALL SCALES, BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCES DID NOT REACH SIGNIFICANCE, POSSIBLY DUE TO LACK OF POWER BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SAMPLE SIZE. CUMULATIVE YOGA MINUTES WERE CORRELATED WITH IMPROVEMENT IN OUTCOME MEASURES. LIMITATION: THIS DOSING STUDY DID NOT INCLUDE A NON-YOGA CONTROL. CONCLUSIONS: IMPROVEMENT IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS CORRELATED WITH CUMULATIVE YOGA PRACTICE. BOTH INTERVENTIONS REDUCED SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY AND INCREASED FEELINGS OF POSITIVITY. THE TIME COMMITMENT FOR YOGA PRACTICE NEEDS TO BE WEIGHED AGAINST BENEFITS WHEN DESIGNING YOGA INTERVENTIONS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
4  217  41 A STUDY PROTOCOL OF A THREE-GROUP RANDOMIZED FEASIBILITY TRIAL OF AN ONLINE YOGA INTERVENTION FOR MOTHERS AFTER STILLBIRTH (THE MINDFUL HEALTH STUDY). BACKGROUND: IN THE USA, STILLBIRTH (IN UTERO FETAL DEATH >/=20 WEEKS GESTATION) IS A MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE. WOMEN WHO EXPERIENCE STILLBIRTH, COMPARED TO WOMEN WITH LIVE BIRTH, HAVE A NEARLY SEVENFOLD INCREASED RISK OF A POSITIVE SCREEN FOR POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) AND A FOURFOLD INCREASED RISK OF DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF WOMEN WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THE DEATH OF THEIR BABY BECOME PREGNANT WITHIN 12-18 MONTHS AND THE LACK OF INTERVENTION STUDIES CONDUCTED WITHIN THIS POPULATION, NOVEL APPROACHES TARGETING PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH, SPECIFIC TO THE NEEDS OF THIS POPULATION, ARE CRITICAL. EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT YOGA IS EFFICACIOUS, SAFE, ACCEPTABLE, AND COST-EFFECTIVE FOR IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH IN A VARIETY OF POPULATIONS, INCLUDING PREGNANT AND POSTPARTUM WOMEN. TO DATE, THERE ARE NO KNOWN STUDIES EXAMINING ONLINE-STREAMING YOGA AS A STRATEGY TO HELP MOTHERS COPE WITH PTSD SYMPTOMS AFTER STILLBIRTH. METHODS: THE PRESENT STUDY IS A TWO-PHASE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. PHASE 1 WILL INVOLVE (1) AN ITERATIVE DESIGN PROCESS TO DEVELOP THE ONLINE YOGA PRESCRIPTION FOR PHASE 2 AND (2) QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS TO IDENTIFY CULTURAL BARRIERS TO RECRUITMENT IN NON-CAUCASIAN WOMEN (I.E., PREDOMINATELY HISPANIC AND/OR AFRICAN AMERICAN) WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED STILLBIRTH (N = 5). PHASE 2 IS A THREE-GROUP RANDOMIZED FEASIBILITY TRIAL WITH ASSESSMENTS AT BASELINE, AND AT 12 AND 20 WEEKS POST-INTERVENTION. NINETY WOMEN WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED A STILLBIRTH WITHIN 6 WEEKS TO 24 MONTHS WILL BE RANDOMIZED INTO ONE OF THE FOLLOWING THREE ARMS FOR 12 WEEKS: (1) INTERVENTION LOW DOSE (LD) = 60 MIN/WEEK ONLINE-STREAMING YOGA (N = 30), (2) INTERVENTION MODERATE DOSE (MD) = 150 MIN/WEEK ONLINE-STREAMING YOGA (N = 30), OR (3) STRETCH AND TONE CONTROL (STC) GROUP = 60 MIN/WEEK OF STRETCHING/TONING EXERCISES (N = 30). DISCUSSION: THIS STUDY WILL EXPLORE THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF A 12-WEEK, HOME-BASED, ONLINE-STREAMED YOGA INTERVENTION, WITH VARYING DOSES AMONG MOTHERS AFTER A STILLBIRTH. IF FEASIBLE, THE FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY WILL INFORM A FULL-SCALE TRIAL TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HOME-BASED ONLINE-STREAMED YOGA TO IMPROVE PTSD. LONG-TERM, HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS COULD USE ONLINE YOGA AS A NON-PHARMACEUTICAL, INEXPENSIVE RESOURCE FOR STILLBIRTH AFTERCARE.

5 1683  44 ONLINE YOGA TO REDUCE POST TRAUMATIC STRESS IN WOMEN WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED STILLBIRTH: A RANDOMIZED CONTROL FEASIBILITY TRIAL. BACKGROUND: ABOUT 1 IN EVERY 150 PREGNANCIES END IN STILLBIRTH. CONSEQUENCES INCLUDE SYMPTOMS OF POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD), DEPRESSION, AND ANXIETY. YOGA HAS BEEN USED TO TREAT PTSD IN OTHER POPULATIONS AND MAY IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR STILLBIRTH MOTHERS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE: (A) FEASIBILITY OF A 12-WEEK HOME-BASED, ONLINE YOGA INTERVENTION WITH VARYING DOSES; (B) ACCEPTABILITY OF A "STRETCH AND TONE" CONTROL GROUP; AND (C) PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF THE INTERVENTION ON REDUCING SYMPTOMS OF PTSD, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, PERINATAL GRIEF, SELF-COMPASSION, EMOTIONAL REGULATION, MINDFULNESS, SLEEP QUALITY, AND SUBJECTIVE HEALTH. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS (N = 90) WERE RECRUITED NATIONALLY AND RANDOMIZED INTO ONE OF THREE GROUPS FOR YOGA OR EXERCISE (LOW DOSE (LD), 60 MIN PER WEEK; MODERATE DOSE (MD), 150 MIN PER WEEK; AND STRETCH-AND-TONE CONTROL GROUP (STC)). BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION SURVEYS MEASURED MAIN OUTCOMES (LISTED ABOVE). FREQUENCY ANALYSES WERE USED TO DETERMINE FEASIBILITY. REPEATED MEASURES ANCOVA WERE USED TO DETERMINE PRELIMINARY EFFICACY. MULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSES WERE USED TO DETERMINE A DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MINUTES OF YOGA AND EACH OUTCOME VARIABLE. RESULTS: OVER HALF OF PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE INTERVENTION (N = 48/90). BENCHMARKS (>/=70% REPORTED > 75% SATISFACTION) WERE MET IN EACH GROUP FOR SATISFACTION AND ENJOYMENT. PARTICIPANTS MEETING BENCHMARKS (COMPLETING > 90% OF PRESCRIBED MINUTES 9/12 WEEKS) FOR LD AND MD GROUPS WERE 44% (N = 8/18) AND 6% (N = 1/16), RESPECTIVELY. LD AND MD GROUPS AVERAGED 44.0 AND 77.3 MIN PER WEEK OF YOGA, RESPECTIVELY. THE MD GROUP REPORTED THAT 150 PRESCRIBED MINUTES PER WEEK OF YOGA WAS TOO MUCH. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN PTSD AND DEPRESSION, AND IMPROVEMENTS IN SELF-RATED HEALTH AT POST-INTERVENTION FOR BOTH INTERVENTION GROUPS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN DEPRESSION SCORES (P = .036) AND GRIEF INTENSITY (P = .009) BETWEEN THE MD AND STC GROUPS. PTSD SHOWED NON-SIGNIFICANT DECREASES OF 43% AND 56% AT POST-INTERVENTION IN LD AND MD GROUPS, RESPECTIVELY (22% DECREASE IN CONTROL). CONCLUSIONS: THIS WAS THE FIRST STUDY TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF AN ONLINE YOGA INTERVENTION FOR WOMEN AFTER STILLBIRTH. FUTURE RESEARCH WARRANTS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. TRIAL REGISTRATION: CLINICALTRIALS.GOV. NCT02925481.

6  170  41 A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF 6-WEEK HIGH INTENSITY HATHA YOGA PROTOCOL ON HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOMES AMONG STUDENTS. OBJECTIVE: MODERN HATHA YOGA EXERCISES (YE) PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WHICH MAY REDUCE STRESS, FACILITATE RECOVERY AND IMPROVE HEALTH. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE SHORT-TERM EFFECTS OF HIGH INTENSITY HATHA YOGA EXERCISES (HIY) ON HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOMES. METHODS: A 6-WEEK RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY WAS PERFORMED TO COMPARE HIY WITH A CONTROL GROUP NOT CHANGING THEIR EXERCISE BEHAVIOR. HEALTHY STUDENTS (N=44; MEDIAN AGE: 25 YEARS, RANGE 20-39 YEARS; HIY: N=21, INCLUDING 3 MEN; CONTROL GROUP: N=23, INCLUDING 3 MEN) NOVICE TO YOGA PARTICIPATED IN THE INTERVENTION WHICH INCLUDED ONE WEEKLY CLASS AND RECOMMENDED HOME TRAINING. PARTICIPANTS PROVIDED SELF-REPORTS IN QUESTIONNAIRES BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION. SELF-REPORTS INCLUDED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION (HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE), STRESS (PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE), SLEEP QUALITY (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX), INSOMNIA (INSOMNIA SEVERITY INDEX), SUBJECTIVE HEALTH COMPLAINTS (COMMON SYMPTOMS IN GENERAL PRACTICE INDEX) AND SELF-RATED HEALTH (SINGLE-ITEM). RESULTS: AFTER THE 6-WEEK INTERVENTION, THERE WERE NO BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCES IN ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, STRESS, SLEEP OR SELF-RATED HEALTH. HOWEVER, WHEN INVESTIGATING ASSOCIATIONS WITHIN THE HIY-GROUP, A HIGHER HIY-DOSE WAS RELATED TO LESS DEPRESSION (R=0.47; P=0.03), IMPROVED SLEEP QUALITY (R=0.55; P=0.01), AND LESS INSOMNIA (R=0.49; P=0.02). CONCLUSIONS: THERE WERE NO SHORT-TERM BETWEEN-GROUP EFFECTS OF HIY ON MENTAL DISTRESS, SLEEP OR SELF-RATED HEALTH. HOWEVER, WITHIN THE HIY-GROUP, A HIGHER DOSE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED MENTAL HEALTH IN TERMS OF DEPRESSION AND WITH IMPROVED SLEEP. ALTHOUGH FUTURE STUDIES WITH LARGER SAMPLES ARE NEEDED, THESE PRELIMINARY FINDINGS SUGGEST SHORT-TERM POSITIVE EFFECTS OF HIY ON HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOMES AMONG STUDENTS.

7 1244  31 FEASIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING A COMPREHENSIVE YOGA PROGRAM AND ITS DOSE-EFFECT RELATIONSHIP ON CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS AND WELLNESS PARAMETERS: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: WE SOUGHT TO STUDY THE FEASIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING A COMPREHENSIVE, MOSTLY SELF-DIRECTED YOGA PROGRAM IN A HOSPITAL AND ITS DOSE-EFFECT RELATIONSHIP ON CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) MEASURES OVER SIX MONTHS. METHODS: YOGA-BASED TECHNIQUES (ADVANCED YOGA PRACTICES; AYP; ADVANCEDYOGAPRACTICES.COM) WERE TAUGHT IN 12 BIWEEKLY GROUP SESSIONS AND SELF-DIRECTED PRACTICE AT HOME WAS EMPHASIZED. CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS WERE ELUCIDATED BY INTERVIEW AND REVIEW OF MEDICAL HISTORY. QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) OUTCOMES INCLUDED THE SF-36, THE COHEN PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE (CPSS), AND THE HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE (HADS). RISK FACTORS AND QOL MEASURES WERE COMPARED IN PARTICIPANTS AT BASELINE AND SIX MONTHS, AS WELL AS BETWEEN THOSE PRACTICING >/= 7 TIMES VERSUS < 7 TIMES PER WEEK. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 22 INDIVIDUALS (19 WOMEN, MEAN AGE 59 +/- 8.7 YEARS) COMPLETED THE STUDY. AT SIX MONTHS, CHANGES WERE NOTED IN THE MENTAL COMPONENT SCALE (MCS) OF THE SF-36 (P=0.0004) AND THE CPSS (P = 0.022). A GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN CPSS WAS NOTED IN THOSE PRACTICING >/= 7 TIMES VERSUS < 7 TIMES A WEEK (P=0.045). NO CHANGES WERE NOTED IN CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS. CONCLUSIONS: THE PRESCRIPTION OF A SELF-DIRECTED YOGA PROGRAM WAS FEASIBLE IN A HOSPITAL SETTING AND RESULTED IN IMPROVEMENT IN QOL MEASURES AT SIX MONTHS. PRACTICING MORE THAN SEVEN TIMES PER WEEK CORRELATED WITH GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN THE PERCEPTION OF STRESS. THUS, AT LEAST A ONCE-DAILY DOSE OF AYP TECHNIQUES FOR A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PERCEIVED STRESS IS AN APPROPRIATE DOSE TO EMPLOY AND STUDY IN HOSPITAL SETTINGS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
8  282  41 ADHERENCE TO YOGA AND EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS IN A 6-MONTH CLINICAL TRIAL. BACKGROUND: TO DETERMINE FACTORS THAT PREDICT ADHERENCE TO A MIND-BODY INTERVENTION IN A RANDOMIZED TRIAL. DESIGN: WE ANALYZED ADHERENCE DATA FROM A 3-ARM TRIAL INVOLVING 135 GENERALLY HEALTHY SENIORS 65-85 YEARS OF AGE RANDOMIZED TO A 6-MONTH INTERVENTION CONSISTING OF: AN IYENGAR YOGA CLASS WITH HOME PRACTICE, AN EXERCISE CLASS WITH HOME PRACTICE, OR A WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP. OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED COGNITIVE FUNCTION, MOOD, FATIGUE, ANXIETY, HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, AND PHYSICAL MEASURES. ADHERENCE TO THE INTERVENTION WAS OBTAINED BY CLASS ATTENDANCE AND BIWEEKLY HOME PRACTICE LOGS. RESULTS: THE DROP-OUT RATE WAS 13%. AMONG THE COMPLETERS OF THE TWO ACTIVE INTERVENTIONS, AVERAGE YOGA CLASS ATTENDANCE WAS 77% AND HOME PRACTICE OCCURRED 64% OF ALL DAYS. AVERAGE EXERCISE CLASS ATTENDANCE WAS 69% AND HOME EXERCISE OCCURRED 54% OF ALL DAYS. THERE WERE NO CLEAR EFFECTS OF ADHERENCE ON THE SIGNIFICANT STUDY OUTCOMES (QUALITY OF LIFE AND PHYSICAL MEASURES). CLASS ATTENDANCE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH BASELINE MEASURES OF DEPRESSION, FATIGUE, AND PHYSICAL COMPONENTS OF HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN BASELINE MEASURES WERE ALSO FOUND BETWEEN STUDY COMPLETERS AND DROP-OUTS IN THE ACTIVE INTERVENTIONS. ADHERENCE WAS NOT RELATED TO AGE, GENDER, OR EDUCATION LEVEL. CONCLUSION: HEALTHY SENIORS HAVE GOOD ATTENDANCE AT CLASSES WITH A PHYSICALLY ACTIVE INTERVENTION. HOME PRACTICE TAKES PLACE OVER HALF OF THE TIME. DECREASED ADHERENCE TO A POTENTIALLY BENEFICIAL INTERVENTION HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DECREASE THE EFFECT OF THE INTERVENTION IN A CLINICAL TRIAL BECAUSE SUBJECTS WHO MIGHT SUSTAIN THE GREATEST BENEFIT WILL RECEIVE A LOWER DOSE OF THE INTERVENTION AND SUBJECTS WITH HIGHER ADHERENCE RATES MAY BE FUNCTIONING CLOSER TO MAXIMUM ABILITY BEFORE THE INTERVENTION. STRATEGIES TO MAXIMIZE ADHERENCE AMONG SUBJECTS AT GREATER RISK FOR LOW ADHERENCE WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR FUTURE TRIALS, ESPECIALLY COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENTS REQUIRING GREATER EFFORT THAN SIMPLE PILL-TAKING.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
9 2212  28 THE HIGH DOSE OF VITAMIN D SUPPLEMENTATION COMBINED WITH YOGA TRAINING IMPROVE THE LEUKOCYTES CELL SURVIVAL-RELATED GENE EXPRESSION IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. BACKGROUND: THIS STUDY AIMED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING COMBINED WITH VITAMIN D SUPPLEMENTATION ON THE EXPRESSION OF SURVIVAL-RELATED GENES IN LEUKOCYTES AND PSYCHO-PHYSICAL STATUS IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. METHODS: THIRTY BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR WOMEN (AGE, 48 +/- 8 YRS) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED INTO THREE GROUPS: HIGH DOSE (4000 IU) OF VITAMIN D SUPPLEMENTATION (HD) (N = 10); YOGA TRAINING WITH A HIGH DOSE OF VITAMIN D (Y + HD); (N = 10); YOGA TRAINING WITH A LOW DOSE (2000 IU) OF VITAMIN D (Y + LD) (N = 10). PARTICIPANTS PERFORMED THE HATHA YOGA STYLE TWICE A WEEK. BLOOD SAMPLES AND A BATTERY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL TESTS WERE TAKEN BEFORE AND AFTER THE COMPLETION OF INTERVENTIONS. EXPRESSION OF P53, NF-KAPPAB, BCL2, AND BAX GENES WAS MEASURED IN LEUKOCYTES. RESULTS: BODY FAT PERCENTAGE (ETAP2 = 0.36), SHOULDER FLEXIBILITY (ETAP2 = 0.38), ROCKPORT WALK TESTS (ETAP2 = 0.49), AND ANXIETY (ETAP2 = 0.52) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED IN BOTH THE Y + HD AND Y + LD GROUPS COMPARED TO THE HD GROUP (P < 0.05). P53 WAS SIGNIFICANTLY OVER-EXPRESSED IN THE Y + HD GROUP WHILE BCL2 UPREGULATED IN BOTH THE Y + HD AND Y + LD GROUPS. NF-KAPPAB AND BAX EXPRESSION DOWNREGULATED IN ALL GROUPS BUT WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. CONCLUSION: YOGA TRAINING COMBINED WITH LOW AND HIGH DOSES OF VD IMPROVED PHYSICAL FITNESS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASURES WHILE ONLY IN COMBINATION WITH A HIGH DOSE OF VD POSITIVELY MODIFIED THE LEUKOCYTES CELL SURVIVAL-RELATED GENE EXPRESSION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
10 2508  49 YOGA BREATHING FOR CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY-ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE: RESULTS OF A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: MANY DEBILITATING SYMPTOMS ARISE FROM CANCER AND ITS TREATMENT THAT ARE OFTEN UNRELIEVED BY ESTABLISHED METHODS. PRANAYAMA, A SERIES OF YOGIC BREATHING TECHNIQUES, MAY IMPROVE CANCER-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE, BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED FOR THIS PURPOSE. OBJECTIVES: A PILOT STUDY WAS PERFORMED TO EVALUATE FEASIBILITY AND TO TEST THE EFFECTS OF PRANAYAMA ON CANCER-ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE. DESIGN: THIS WAS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL COMPARING PRANAYAMA TO USUAL CARE. SETTING: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT A UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER. SUBJECTS: PATIENTS RECEIVING CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE PRANAYAMA IMMEDIATELY OR AFTER A WAITING PERIOD (CONTROL GROUP). INTERVENTIONS: THE PRANAYAMA INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF FOUR BREATHING TECHNIQUES TAUGHT IN WEEKLY CLASSES AND PRACTICED AT HOME. THE TREATMENT GROUP RECEIVED PRANAYAMA DURING TWO CONSECUTIVE CYCLES OF CHEMOTHERAPY. THE CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED USUAL CARE DURING THEIR FIRST CYCLE, AND RECEIVED PRANAYAMA DURING THEIR SECOND CYCLE OF CHEMOTHERAPY. OUTCOME MEASURES: FEASIBILITY, CANCER-ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS (FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, STRESS), AND QUALITY OF LIFE WERE THE OUTCOMES. RESULTS: CLASS ATTENDANCE WAS NEARLY 100% IN BOTH GROUPS. SIXTEEN (16) PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL INTENT-TO-TREAT ANALYSES. THE REPEATED-MEASURES ANALYSES DEMONSTRATED THAT ANY INCREASE IN PRANAYAMA DOSE, WITH DOSE MEASURED IN THE NUMBER OF HOURS PRACTICED IN CLASS OR AT HOME, RESULTED IN IMPROVED SYMPTOM AND QUALITY-OF-LIFE SCORES. SEVERAL OF THESE ASSOCIATIONS--SLEEP DISTURBANCE (P=0.04), ANXIETY (P=0.04), AND MENTAL QUALITY OF LIFE (P=0.05)--REACHED OR APPROACHED STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA BREATHING WAS A FEASIBLE INTERVENTION AMONG PATIENTS WITH CANCER RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY. PRANAYAMA MAY IMPROVE SLEEP DISTURBANCE, ANXIETY, AND MENTAL QUALITY OF LIFE. A DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP WAS FOUND BETWEEN PRANAYAMA USE AND IMPROVEMENTS IN CHEMOTHERAPY-ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE. THESE FINDINGS NEED TO BE CONFIRMED IN A LARGER STUDY.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
11   91  43 A MULTICOMPONENT YOGA-BASED, BREATH INTERVENTION PROGRAM AS AN ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT IN PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER WITH OR WITHOUT COMORBIDITIES. OBJECTIVES: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY AND TOLERABILITY OF SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA (SKY) COURSE IN GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER (GAD) OUTPATIENTS, WHO AFTER EIGHT WEEKS OF AN APPROPRIATE DOSE OF TRADITIONAL THERAPY HAD NOT YET ACHIEVED REMISSION. SUBJECTS: THE ADULT PARTICIPANTS (18-65 YEARS) WERE OUTPATIENTS WITH A PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS OF GAD WITH OR WITHOUT COMORBIDITIES ON THE MINI-INTERNATIONAL NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INTERVIEW (MINI). PARTICIPANTS HAD A MINIMUM OF EIGHT WEEKS STANDARD TREATMENT WITH AN APPROPRIATE DOSE OF A STANDARD PRESCRIPTION ANXIOLYTIC, A CLINICIAN GLOBAL IMPRESSION-SEVERITY (CGI-S) SCORE OF 5-7, A HAMILTON ANXIETY SCALE (HAM-A) TOTAL SCORE >/=20 INCLUDING A SCORE OF >2 ON THE ANXIOUS MOOD AND TENSION ITEMS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FORTY-ONE PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED IN AN OPEN-LABEL TRIAL OF THE SKY COURSE AS AN ADJUNCT TO STANDARD TREATMENT OF GAD AT THE START CLINIC FOR MOOD AND ANXIETY DISORDERS, A TERTIARY CARE MOOD AND ANXIETY DISORDER CLINIC IN TORONTO. THE SKY COURSE WAS ADMINISTERED OVER FIVE DAYS (22 H TOTAL). SUBJECTS WERE ENCOURAGED TO PRACTICE THE YOGA BREATHING TECHNIQUES AT HOME FOR 20 MIN PER DAY AFTER THE COURSE AND WERE OFFERED GROUP PRACTICE SESSIONS FOR 2 H ONCE A WEEK LED BY CERTIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTORS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS THE MEAN CHANGE FROM PRE-TREATMENT ON THE HAM-A SCALE. PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASURES WERE OBTAINED AT BASELINE AND FOUR WEEKS AFTER COMPLETING THE INTERVENTION. RESULTS: THIRTY-ONE PATIENTS COMPLETED THE PROGRAM (MEAN AGE 42.6 +/- 13.3 YEARS). AMONG COMPLETERS, SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS OCCURRED IN THE PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION MEAN HAM-A TOTAL SCORE (T=4.59; P<0.01) AND PSYCHIC SUBSCALE (T=5.00; P</=0.01). THE RESPONSE RATE WAS 73% AND THE REMISSION RATE 41% AS MEASURED ON THE HAM-A. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS OF THIS SMALL PILOT TRIAL SUGGEST THAT THE SKY COURSE REPRESENTS A POTENTIALLY VALUABLE ADJUNCT TO STANDARD PHARMACOTHERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH GAD OR TREATMENT-RESISTANT GAD, AND WARRANTS FURTHER INVESTIGATION. IN PARTICULAR, CHANGES IN WORRY AND BODY SYMPTOMS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS THAT MAY FURTHER OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISM OF CHANGE IN THE TOLERANCE OF ANXIETY AND WORRY.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
12 1966  35 SERUM AND GENE EXPRESSION PROFILE OF CYTOKINES FOLLOWING COMBINATION OF YOGA TRAINING AND VITAMIN D SUPPLEMENTATION IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: THIS STUDY AIMED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF THE COMBINATION OF YOGA TRAINING WITH HIGH VITAMIN D DOSE SUPPLEMENTATION ON THE EXPRESSION AND SYSTEMIC LEVELS OF INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES AND PSYCHOPHYSICAL STATUS OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. METHODS: THIRTY VOLUNTEERED BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS (48 +/- 8 YEARS) WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO A HIGH DOSE (4000 IU) OF VITAMIN D SUPPLEMENTATION (HD) GROUP (N = 10), YOGA WITH A HIGH DOSE OF VITAMIN D (YHD) GROUP (N = 10), AND YOGA WITH A LOW DOSE (2000 IU) OF VITAMIN D (YLD) GROUP (N = 10). PARTICIPANTS PERFORMED THE HATHA YOGA STYLE FOR 12 WEEKS, TWICE A WEEK. BLOOD SAMPLES, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) QUESTIONNAIRE, AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE TESTS WERE TAKEN BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION. RESULTS: BODY FAT PERCENTAGE (ETAP(2) = 0.36), HANDGRIP STRENGTH (ETAP(2) = 0.41) AND QOL INDICATORS INCLUDE GLOBAL HEALTH (ETAP(2) = 0.54), FUNCTIONAL SCALES (ETAP(2) = 0.49), AND SYMPTOMS SCALES (ETAP(2) = 0.50) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED IN THE BOTH YHD AND YLD GROUPS COMPARED TO THE HD GROUP (P < 0.05). ALSO, INTERLEUKIN-10 (IL-10) LEVELS WERE MARKEDLY INCREASED IN THE Y-HVD GROUP COMPARED TO THE Y-LVD AND HVD GROUPS. MOREOVER, THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR-ALPHA (TNF-ALPHA) AND INTERLEUKIN-6 LEVELS IN THE Y-HVD GROUP AFTER THE INTERVENTION. THE ANTI-INFLAMMATORY INDEX (IL-10/TNF-ALPHA) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN BOTH THE YOGA GROUPS (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: YOGA PROMOTES PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FITNESS AND, IN COMBINATION WITH A HIGH DOSE OF VITAMIN D, IMPROVES THE CYTOKINE PROFILE, WHICH CAN EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE SIDE EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH CANCER.

13 1527  36 IYENGAR YOGA FOR DISTRESSED WOMEN: A 3-ARMED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. DISTRESS IS AN INCREASING PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM. WE AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF AN IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM ON PERCEIVED STRESS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES IN DISTRESSED WOMEN AND EVALUATED A POTENTIAL DOSE-EFFECT RELATIONSHIP. SEVENTY-TWO FEMALE DISTRESSED SUBJECTS WERE INCLUDED INTO A 3-ARMED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL AND ALLOCATED TO YOGA GROUP 1 (N = 24) WITH TWELVE 90 MIN SESSIONS OVER 3 MONTHS, YOGA GROUP 2 (N = 24) WITH 24 SESSIONS OVER 3 MONTHS, OR A WAITING LIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 24). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS STRESS PERCEPTION, MEASURED BY COHEN STRESS SCALE; SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED STATE TRAIT ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), PROFILE OF MOOD STATES, WELL BEING, AND BODILY COMPLAINTS. AFTER THREE MONTHS, WOMEN IN THE YOGA GROUPS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN PERCEIVED STRESS (P = 0.003), STATE TRAIT ANXIETY (P = 0.021 AND P = 0.003), DEPRESSION (P = 0.008), PSYCHOLOGICAL QOL (P = 0.012), MOOD STATES BEING (P = 0.007), AND BODILY COMPLAINTS WELL(P = 0.012) WHEN COMPARED TO CONTROLS. BOTH YOGA PROGRAMS WERE SIMILARLY EFFECTIVE FOR THESE OUTCOMES; HOWEVER, COMPLIANCE WAS BETTER IN THE GROUP WITH FEWER SESSIONS (YOGA GROUP 1). DOSE EFFECTS WERE SEEN ONLY IN THE ANALYSIS OF GROUP-INDEPENDENT EFFECTS FOR BACK PAIN, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT IYENGAR YOGA EFFECTIVELY REDUCES DISTRESS AND IMPROVES RELATED PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL OUTCOMES. FURTHERMORE, ATTENDING TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES WAS NOT SUPERIOR TO ONCE-WEEKLY CLASSES, AS A RESULT OF LIMITED COMPLIANCE IN THE TWICE-WEEKLY GROUP.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
14 2117  37 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON WOMEN WITH SECONDARY ARM LYMPHOEDEMA FROM BREAST CANCER TREATMENT. BACKGROUND: WOMEN WHO DEVELOP SECONDARY ARM LYMPHOEDEMA SUBSEQUENT TO TREATMENT ASSOCIATED WITH BREAST CANCER REQUIRE LIFE-LONG MANAGEMENT FOR A RANGE OF SYMPTOMS INCLUDING ARM SWELLING, HEAVINESS, TIGHTNESS IN THE ARM AND SOMETIMES THE CHEST, UPPER BODY IMPAIRMENT AND CHANGES TO A RANGE OF PARAMETERS RELATING TO QUALITY OF LIFE. WHILE EXERCISE UNDER CONTROLLED CONDITIONS HAS HAD POSITIVE OUTCOMES, THE IMPACT OF YOGA HAS NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN THE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHO-SOCIAL DOMAINS, IN THE HOPE THAT WOMEN CAN BE OFFERED ANOTHER SAFE, HOLISTIC MODALITY TO HELP CONTROL MANY, IF NOT ALL, OF THE EFFECTS OF SECONDARY ARM LYMPHOEDEMA. METHODS AND DESIGN: A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED PILOT TRIAL WILL BE CONDUCTED IN HOBART AND LAUNCESTON WITH A TOTAL OF 40 WOMEN RECEIVING EITHER YOGA INTERVENTION OR CURRENT BEST PRACTICE CARE. INTERVENTION WILL CONSIST OF EIGHT WEEKS OF A WEEKLY TEACHER-LED YOGA CLASS WITH A HOME-BASED DAILY YOGA PRACTICE DELIVERED BY DVD. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES WILL BE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON LYMPHOEDEMA AND ITS ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE. SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES WILL BE RANGE OF MOTION OF THE ARM AND THORACIC SPINE, SHOULDER STRENGTH, AND WEEKLY AND DAILY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES WILL BE MEASURED AT BASELINE, WEEKS FOUR, EIGHT AND A FOUR WEEK FOLLOW UP AT WEEK TWELVE. RANGE OF MOTION OF THE SPINE, IN A SELF-NOMINATED GROUP, WILL BE MEASURED AT BASELINE, WEEKS EIGHT AND TWELVE. A FURTHER OUTCOME WILL BE THE WOMEN'S PERCEPTIONS OF THE YOGA COLLECTED BY INTERVIEW AT WEEK EIGHT.

15 1495  30 INTERVENTION PROTOCOL FOR INVESTIGATING YOGA IMPLEMENTED DURING CHEMOTHERAPY. OBJECTIVE: FATIGUE AND OTHER TREATMENT-RELATED SYMPTOMS ARE CRITICAL THERAPEUTIC TARGETS FOR IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH COLORECTAL CANCER DURING CHEMOTHERAPY. YOGA IS A PROMISING INTERVENTION FOR IMPROVING THESE THERAPEUTIC TARGETS AND HAS BEEN PRIMARILY INVESTIGATED IN THE GROUP-CLASS FORMAT, WHICH IS LESS FEASIBLE FOR CANCER PATIENTS WITH HIGH SYMPTOM BURDEN TO ATTEND. THUS, WE DEVELOPED A PROTOCOL FOR IMPLEMENTING YOGA INDIVIDUALLY IN THE CLINIC AMONG PATIENTS RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY. METHODS: WE FOLLOWED RECOMMENDED DOMAINS FOR DEVELOPING A YOGA PROTOCOL TO BE USED IN AN EFFICACY TRIAL. THESE RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE CONSIDERATION TO THE STYLE, DELIVERY, COMPONENTS OF THE INTERVENTION, DOSE, SPECIFIC CLASS SEQUENCES, FACILITATION OF HOME PRACTICE, MEASUREMENT OF INTERVENTION FIDELITY, SELECTION OF INSTRUCTORS, AND DEALING WITH MODIFICATIONS. THE INTERVENTION PROTOCOL WAS DEVELOPED BY AN INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM. PROTOCOL: YOGA SKILLS TRAINING (YST) CONSISTS OF FOUR 30-MINUTE IN-PERSON SESSIONS AND WAS IMPLEMENTED WHILE IN THE CHAIR DURING CHEMOTHERAPY INFUSIONS FOR COLORECTAL CANCER WITH RECOMMENDED DAILY HOME PRACTICE FOR EIGHT WEEKS. THERAPEUTIC GOALS OF THE YST ARE TO REDUCE FATIGUE, CIRCADIAN DISRUPTION, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. ELEMENTS OF THE YST ARE AWARENESS MEDITATION, GENTLE SEATED MOVEMENT, BREATHING PRACTICE, AND RELAXATION MEDITATION. ATTENTION, COMFORT, AND EASE ARE ALSO HIGHLIGHTED. CONCLUSION: THIS DESCRIPTION OF A PROTOCOL FOR INTEGRATING YOGA WITH CONVENTIONAL CANCER TREATMENT WILL INFORM FUTURE STUDY DESIGNS AND CLINICAL PRACTICE. THE DESIGN OF THE YST IS NOVEL BECAUSE IT IMPLEMENTS YOGA-MOST COMMONLY STUDIED WHEN TAUGHT TO GROUPS OUTSIDE OF THE CLINICAL SETTING- INDIVIDUALLY DURING CLINICAL CARE.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
16 1407  38 IMPACT OF YOGA ON INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. BACKGROUND: MANY CHRONIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING HEART DISEASE, CANCER, AND RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, ARE ASSOCIATED WITH UNDERLYING CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY PROCESSES. LITERATURE REVIEWS HAVE ANALYZED A VARIETY OF INTEGRATIVE THERAPIES AND THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH CHRONIC INFLAMMATION. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW IS UNIQUE IN REPORTING SOLELY ON YOGA'S RELATIONSHIP WITH INFLAMMATION. ITS PURPOSE WAS TO SYNTHESIZE CURRENT LITERATURE EXAMINING THE IMPACT OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS IN ADULTS WITH CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY-RELATED DISORDERS. METHOD: SEARCHES OF SEVERAL ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE CONDUCTED. INCLUSION CRITERIA WERE (A) ENGLISH LANGUAGE, (B) SAMPLE AGE >18 YEARS OLD, (C) YOGA INTERVENTIONS INVOLVING POSTURES WITH OR WITHOUT YOGA BREATHING AND/OR MEDITATION, AND (D) MEASURED INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS. RESULTS: THE FINAL REVIEW INCLUDED 15 PRIMARY STUDIES. OF THESE, SEVEN WERE RATED AS EXCELLENT AND EIGHT AS AVERAGE OR FAIR. THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE VARIABILITY IN YOGA TYPES, COMPONENTS, FREQUENCY, SESSION LENGTH, INTERVENTION DURATION, AND INTENSITY. THE MOST COMMON BIOMARKERS MEASURED WERE INTERLEUKIN-6 ( N = 11), C-REACTIVE PROTEIN ( N = 10), AND TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR ( N = 8). MOST STUDIES REPORTED POSITIVE EFFECTS ON INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS ( N = 11) FROM BASELINE TO POST YOGA INTERVENTION. ANALYSIS OF THE DOSE SHOWED HIGHER TOTAL DOSE (>1,000 MIN) RESULTED IN GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN INFLAMMATION. CONCLUSION: THIS REVIEW SUGGESTS THAT YOGA CAN BE A VIABLE INTERVENTION TO REDUCE INFLAMMATION ACROSS A MULTITUDE OF CHRONIC CONDITIONS. FUTURE STUDIES WITH DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS, MEASUREMENT OF NEW AND WELL-ESTABLISHED INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS, AND LARGER SAMPLE SIZES ARE WARRANTED TO ADVANCE THE SCIENCE AND CORROBORATE RESULTS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
17 2623  35 YOGA FOR SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT IN ONCOLOGY: A REVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE BASE AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS FOR RESEARCH. BECAUSE YOGA IS INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED AS A COMPLEMENTARY APPROACH TO CANCER SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT, PATIENTS/SURVIVORS AND PROVIDERS NEED TO UNDERSTAND ITS POTENTIAL BENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS BOTH DURING AND AFTER TREATMENT. THE AUTHORS REVIEWED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) OF YOGA CONDUCTED AT THESE POINTS IN THE CANCER CONTINUUM (N = 29; N = 13 DURING TREATMENT, N = 12 POST-TREATMENT, AND N = 4 WITH MIXED SAMPLES). FINDINGS BOTH DURING AND AFTER TREATMENT DEMONSTRATED THE EFFICACY OF YOGA TO IMPROVE OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), WITH IMPROVEMENT IN SUBDOMAINS OF QOL VARYING ACROSS STUDIES. FATIGUE WAS THE MOST COMMONLY MEASURED OUTCOME, AND MOST RCTS CONDUCTED DURING OR AFTER CANCER TREATMENT REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN FATIGUE. RESULTS ALSO SUGGESTED THAT YOGA CAN IMPROVE STRESS/DISTRESS DURING TREATMENT AND POST-TREATMENT DISTURBANCES IN SLEEP AND COGNITION. SEVERAL RCTS PROVIDED EVIDENCE THAT YOGA MAY IMPROVE BIOMARKERS OF STRESS, INFLAMMATION, AND IMMUNE FUNCTION. OUTCOMES WITH LIMITED OR MIXED FINDINGS (EG, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, PAIN, CANCER-SPECIFIC SYMPTOMS, SUCH AS LYMPHEDEMA) AND POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES (SUCH AS BENEFIT-FINDING AND LIFE SATISFACTION) WARRANT FURTHER STUDY. IMPORTANT FUTURE DIRECTIONS FOR YOGA RESEARCH IN ONCOLOGY INCLUDE: ENROLLING PARTICIPANTS WITH CANCER TYPES OTHER THAN BREAST, STANDARDIZING SELF-REPORT ASSESSMENTS, INCREASING THE USE OF ACTIVE CONTROL GROUPS AND OBJECTIVE MEASURES, AND ADDRESSING THE HETEROGENEITY OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS, WHICH VARY IN TYPE, KEY COMPONENTS (MOVEMENT, MEDITATION, BREATHING), DOSE, AND DELIVERY MODE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
18 2644  34 YOGA FOR WOMEN WITH URGENCY URINARY INCONTINENCE: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVES: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF A GENTLE YOGA PROGRAM FOR WOMEN WITH URGENCY URINARY INCONTINENCE (UUI). ALSO, THESE PRELIMINARY DATA CAN EVALUATE IF YOGA IMPROVES SYMPTOM BURDEN, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS FOR WOMEN WITH UUI. METHODS: THIS PROSPECTIVE NONRANDOMIZED SINGLE-ARM PILOT STUDY EVALUATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A TWICE-WEEKLY, 8-WEEK GENTLE YOGA INTERVENTION TO REDUCE UUI SYMPTOM BURDEN. CHANGES IN SYMPTOM BURDEN WERE MEASURED USING THE PELVIC FLOOR DISTRESS INVENTORY 20. SECONDARY MEASURES INCLUDED QUALITY OF LIFE, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, SLEEP, STRESS, ANXIETY, AND INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS. OUTCOMES WERE EVALUATED WITH PAIRED T TESTING. RESULTS: TWELVE WOMEN COMPLETED THE YOGA INTERVENTION WITH NO ADVERSE OUTCOMES NOTED. URGENCY SYMPTOM BURDEN WAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED AFTER THE INTERVENTION (P = 0.01), AND WOMEN REPORTED AN INCREASE IN QUALITY OF LIFE (P = 0.04) AFTER THE YOGA INTERVENTION. FOLLOWING THE YOGA INTERVENTION, THE MAJORITY OF WOMEN REPORTED SYMPTOMS AS "MUCH BETTER" (N = 4 [33%]) AND "A LITTLE BETTER" (N = 5 [42%]), WITH 3 WOMEN (25%) REPORTING "NO CHANGE." WOMEN ALSO REPORTED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (P = 0.03) AND BETTER QUALITY OF SLEEP (P = 0.03). NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE FOUND IN ANXIETY OR STRESS PERCEPTION. PLASMA LEVELS OF THE INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKER TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR ALPHA WERE REDUCED AFTER YOGA INTERVENTION (P = 0.009); HOWEVER, NO SIGNIFICANT POSTYOGA CHANGES WERE FOUND FOR INTERLEUKIN 6 OR C-REACTIVE PROTEIN. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY PROVIDES PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE THAT YOGA IS A FEASIBLE COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY THAT REDUCES INCONTINENCE SYMPTOM BURDEN, ALONG WITH IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, AND SLEEP QUALITY. ADDITIONALLY, YOGA MAY LOWER INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS ASSOCIATED WITH INCONTINENCE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
19 2699  41 YOGA INTERVENTION FOR ADULTS WITH MILD-TO-MODERATE ASTHMA: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: PRELIMINARY STUDIES INVESTIGATING YOGA AND BREATH WORK FOR TREATING ASTHMA HAVE BEEN PROMISING. SEVERAL RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS HAVE SHOWN A BENEFIT FROM YOGA POSTURES AND BREATHING VS CONTROL, BUT THE CONTROL IN THESE CASES INVOLVED NO INTERVENTION OTHER THAN USUAL CARE. THIS STUDY ADVANCES THE FIELD BY PROVIDING AN ACTIVE CONTROL. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA AND BREATH WORK INTERVENTION FOR IMPROVING CLINICAL INDICES AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN ADULTS WITH MILD-TO-MODERATE ASTHMA. METHODS: A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED, DOUBLE-MASKED CLINICAL TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED BETWEEN OCTOBER 1, 2001, AND MARCH 31, 2003. RANDOM ASSIGNMENT WAS MADE TO EITHER A 4-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION THAT INCLUDED POSTURES AND BREATH WORK OR A STRETCHING CONTROL CONDITION. OUTCOME MEASURES WERE EVALUATED AT 4, 8, 12, AND 16 WEEKS AND INCLUDED THE MINI ASTHMA QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE, RESCUE INHALER USE, SPIROMETRY, SYMPTOM DIARIES, AND HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION. RESULTS: SIXTY-TWO PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO THE INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS, AND 45 COMPLETED THE FINAL FOLLOW-UP MEASURES. INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED. SIGNIFICANT WITHIN-GROUP DIFFERENCES IN POSTBRONCHODILATOR FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1 SECOND AND MORNING SYMPTOM SCORES WERE APPARENT IN BOTH GROUPS AT 4 AND 16 WEEKS; HOWEVER, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS WERE OBSERVED ON ANY OUTCOME MEASURES. CONCLUSIONS: IYENGAR YOGA CONFERRED NO APPRECIABLE BENEFIT IN MILD-TO-MODERATE ASTHMA. CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH YOGA IS OF BENEFIT IN ASTHMA MANAGEMENT, IF ANY, REMAIN TO BE DETERMINED.	2005	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
20 1215  45 EXPLORING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY AND PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES AFTER CANCER TREATMENT: A STUDY PROTOCOL. BACKGROUND: FOLLOWING CANCER TREATMENT, ADULTS COMMONLY REPORT WORSENED PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES (PROS) SUCH AS ANXIETY, STRESS, DEPRESSION, PERSISTENT AND UPSETTING COGNITIVE COMPLAINTS, UNRELENTING FATIGUE, AND REDUCED QUALITY OF LIFE. POORER PROS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DISRUPTED AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM FUNCTIONING AS MEASURED BY HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV), BOTH OF WHICH HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE HRV AND PROS AMONG ADULTS FOLLOWING CANCER TREATMENT ARE NEEDED. YOGA THERAPY HOLDS PROMISE AS AN INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE HRV AND PROS. THEREFORE, WE CONDUCTED A SINGLE-SUBJECT EXPLORATORY EXPERIMENTAL STUDY TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY ON HRV AND SPECIFIC PROS (IE, CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, ANXIETY, COGNITIVE FUNCTION, DEPRESSION, STRESS, QUALITY OF LIFE) IN ADULTS TREATED FOR CANCER. TO REDUCE PUBLICATION BIAS, IMPROVE REPRODUCIBILITY, AND SERVE AS A REFERENCE FOR FORTHCOMING REPORTING OF STUDY RESULTS, WE PRESENT THE STUDY PROTOCOL FOR THIS STUDY HEREIN. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE ADULTS WHO COMPLETED CANCER TREATMENT THAT WERE RECRUITED FROM THE OTTAWA INTEGRATIVE CANCER CENTRE. CONSENTING AND ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED ONE 1:1 YOGA THERAPY SESSION (IE, 1 PARTICIPANT, 1 YOGA THERAPIST) AND 6 WEEKLY GROUP-BASED YOGA THERAPY SESSIONS (IE, 2-3 PARTICIPANTS, 1 YOGA THERAPIST). PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED ASSESSMENTS 7 TIMES: 3 TIMES PRIOR TO THE PROGRAM (IE, -6 WEEKS, -3 WEEKS, IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE 1:1 YOGA THERAPY SESSION), IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE 1:1 YOGA THERAPY SESSION, PRIOR TO THE FIRST GROUP-BASED YOGA THERAPY SESSION, AFTER THE LAST GROUP-BASED YOGA THERAPY SESSION, AND AT A 6-WEEK FOLLOW-UP. HIERARCHICAL LINEAR MODELING WILL BE USED TO TEST THE AVERAGE EFFECTS OF THE YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM ACROSS PARTICIPANTS. DISCUSSION: THIS STUDY WILL EXPLORE SEVERAL NOVEL HYPOTHESES, INCLUDING WHETHER YOGA THERAPY CAN IMPROVE HRV AND/OR SPECIFIC PROS AMONG ADULTS TREATED FOR CANCER ACUTELY (IE, DURING A 1:1 YOGA THERAPY SESSION) AND/OR THROUGH REPEATED EXPOSURE (IE, AFTER COMPLETING 6 WEEKS OF GROUP-BASED YOGA THERAPY). ALTHOUGH THE FINDINGS WILL REQUIRE CONFIRMATION OR REFUTATION IN FUTURE TRIALS, THEY MAY PROVIDE INITIAL EVIDENCE THAT YT MAY BENEFIT ADULTS TREATED FOR CANCER.

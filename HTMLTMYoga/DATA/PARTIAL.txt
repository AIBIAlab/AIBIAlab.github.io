1 2138 145 THE EFFECTS OF AN 8-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION ON EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IN OLDER ADULTS. BACKGROUND: FEW SCIENTIFIC STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED MOVEMENT-BASED EMBODIED CONTEMPLATIVE PRACTICES SUCH AS YOGA AND THEIR EFFECTS ON COGNITION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF AN 8-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION ON EXECUTIVE FUNCTION MEASURES OF TASK SWITCHING AND WORKING MEMORY CAPACITY. METHODS: COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS (N = 118; MEAN AGE = 62.0) WERE RANDOMIZED TO ONE OF TWO GROUPS: A HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION OR A STRETCHING-STRENGTHENING CONTROL. BOTH GROUPS PARTICIPATED IN HOUR-LONG EXERCISE CLASSES 3X/WEEK OVER THE 8-WEEK STUDY PERIOD. ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED ESTABLISHED TESTS OF EXECUTIVE FUNCTION INCLUDING THE TASK SWITCHING PARADIGM, N-BACK AND RUNNING MEMORY SPAN AT BASELINE AND FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCES SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTER REACTION TIMES ON THE MIXED AND REPEAT TASK SWITCHING TRIALS (PARTIAL ETA(2) = .04, P < .05) FOR THE HATHA YOGA GROUP. HIGHER ACCURACY WAS RECORDED ON THE SINGLE TRIALS (PARTIAL ETA(2) = .05, P < .05), THE 2-BACK CONDITION OF THE N-BACK (PARTIAL ETA(2) = .08, P < .001), AND PARTIAL RECALL SCORES (PARTIAL ETA(2) = .06, P < .01) OF RUNNING SPAN TASK. CONCLUSIONS: FOLLOWING 8 WEEKS OF YOGA PRACTICE, PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED PERFORMANCE ON THE EXECUTIVE FUNCTION MEASURES OF WORKING MEMORY CAPACITY AND EFFICIENCY OF MENTAL SET SHIFTING AND FLEXIBILITY COMPARED WITH THEIR STRETCHING-STRENGTHENING COUNTERPARTS. ALTHOUGH THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED, THESE RESULTS DEMAND LARGER SYSTEMATIC TRIALS TO THOROUGHLY EXAMINE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON EXECUTIVE FUNCTION AS WELL AS ACROSS OTHER DOMAINS OF COGNITION, AND ITS POTENTIAL TO MAINTAIN OR IMPROVE COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING IN THE AGING PROCESS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
2  669  43 EFFECT OF A 16-WEEK BIKRAM YOGA PROGRAM ON PERCEIVED STRESS, SELF-EFFICACY AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN STRESSED AND SEDENTARY ADULTS: A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF 16 WEEKS OF BIKRAM YOGA ON PERCEIVED STRESS, SELF-EFFICACY AND HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) IN SEDENTARY, STRESSED ADULTS. DESIGN: 16 WEEK, PARALLEL-ARM, RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH FLEXIBLE DOSING. METHODS: PHYSICALLY INACTIVE, STRESSED ADULTS (37.2+/-10.8 YEARS) WERE RANDOMISED TO BIKRAM YOGA (THREE TO FIVE CLASSES PER WEEK) OR CONTROL (NO TREATMENT) GROUP FOR 16 WEEKS. OUTCOME MEASURES, COLLECTED VIA SELF-REPORT, INCLUDED PERCEIVED STRESS, GENERAL SELF-EFFICACY, AND HRQOL. OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE, MIDPOINT AND COMPLETION. RESULTS: INDIVIDUALS WERE RANDOMISED TO THE EXPERIMENTAL (N=29) OR CONTROL GROUP (N=34). AVERAGE ATTENDANCE IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS 27+/-18 CLASSES. REPEATED MEASURE ANALYSES OF VARIANCE (INTENTION-TO-TREAT) DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED PERCEIVED STRESS (P=0.003, PARTIAL ETA(2)=0.109), GENERAL SELF-EFFICACY (P=0.034, PARTIAL ETA(2)=0.056), AND THE GENERAL HEALTH (P=0.034, PARTIAL ETA(2)=0.058) AND ENERGY/FATIGUE (P=0.019, PARTIAL ETA(2)=0.066) DOMAINS OF HRQOL IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP VERSUS THE CONTROL GROUP. ATTENDANCE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCTIONS IN PERCEIVED STRESS, AND AN INCREASE IN SEVERAL DOMAINS OF HRQOL. CONCLUSIONS: 16 WEEKS OF BIKRAM YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED PERCEIVED STRESS, GENERAL SELF-EFFICACY AND HRQOL IN SEDENTARY, STRESSED ADULTS. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD CONSIDER WAYS TO OPTIMISE ADHERENCE, AND SHOULD INVESTIGATE EFFECTS OF BIKRAM YOGA INTERVENTION IN OTHER POPULATIONS AT RISK FOR STRESS-RELATED ILLNESS.

3  668  52 EFFECT OF A 16-WEEK BIKRAM YOGA PROGRAM ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY AND ASSOCIATED CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK FACTORS IN STRESSED AND SEDENTARY ADULTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC ACTIVATION OF THE STRESS-RESPONSE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK, PARTICULARLY IN SEDENTARY INDIVIDUALS. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECT OF A BIKRAM YOGA INTERVENTION ON THE HIGH FREQUENCY POWER COMPONENT OF HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) AND ASSOCIATED CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (CVD) RISK FACTORS (I.E. ADDITIONAL DOMAINS OF HRV, HEMODYNAMIC, HEMATOLOGIC, ANTHROPOMETRIC AND BODY COMPOSITION OUTCOME MEASURES) IN STRESSED AND SEDENTARY ADULTS. METHODS: ELIGIBLE ADULTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO AN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (N = 29) OR A NO TREATMENT CONTROL GROUP (N = 34). EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PARTICIPANTS WERE INSTRUCTED TO ATTEND THREE TO FIVE SUPERVISED BIKRAM YOGA CLASSES PER WEEK FOR 16 WEEKS AT LOCAL STUDIOS. OUTCOME MEASURES WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE (WEEK 0) AND COMPLETION (WEEK 17). RESULTS: SIXTY-THREE ADULTS (37.2 +/- 10.8 YEARS, 79% WOMEN) WERE INCLUDED IN THE INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP ATTENDED 27 +/- 18 CLASSES. ANALYSES OF COVARIANCE REVEALED NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE HIGH-FREQUENCY COMPONENT OF HRV (P = 0.912, PARTIAL ETA (2) = 0.000) OR IN ANY SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE BETWEEN GROUPS OVER TIME. HOWEVER, REGRESSION ANALYSES REVEALED THAT HIGHER ATTENDANCE IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (P = 0.039; PARTIAL ETA (2) = 0.154), BODY FAT PERCENTAGE (P = 0.001, PARTIAL ETA (2) = 0.379), FAT MASS (P = 0.003, PARTIAL ETA (2) = 0.294) AND BODY MASS INDEX (P = 0.05, PARTIAL ETA (2) = 0.139). CONCLUSIONS: A 16-WEEK BIKRAM YOGA PROGRAM DID NOT INCREASE THE HIGH FREQUENCY POWER COMPONENT OF HRV OR ANY OTHER CVD RISK FACTORS INVESTIGATED. AS REVEALED BY POST HOC ANALYSES, LOW ADHERENCE LIKELY CONTRIBUTED TO THE NULL EFFECTS. FUTURE STUDIES ARE REQUIRED TO ADDRESS BARRIERS TO ADHERENCE TO BETTER ELUCIDATE THE DOSE-RESPONSE EFFECTS OF BIKRAM YOGA PRACTICE AS A MEDIUM TO LOWER STRESS-RELATED CVD RISK.

4   23  53 #MINDINBODY - FEASIBILITY OF VIGOROUS EXERCISE (BIKRAM YOGA VERSUS HIGH INTENSITY INTERVAL TRAINING) TO IMPROVE PERSISTENT PAIN IN WOMEN WITH A HISTORY OF TRAUMA: A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL. BACKGROUND: THE NEUROBIOLOGY OF PERSISTENT PAIN SHARES COMMON UNDERLYING PSYCHOBIOLOGY WITH THAT OF TRAUMATIC STRESS. MODERN TREATMENTS FOR TRAUMATIC STRESS OFTEN INVOLVE BOTTOM-UP SENSORIMOTOR RETRAINING/EXPOSURE THERAPIES, WHERE BREATH, MOVEMENT, BALANCE AND MINDFULNESS, ARE USED TO TARGET UNDERLYING PSYCHOBIOLOGY. VIGOROUS EXERCISE, IN PARTICULAR BIKRAM YOGA, COMBINES MANY OF THESE SENSORIMOTOR/EXPOSURE THERAPEUTIC FEATURES. HOWEVER, THERE IS VERY LITTLE RESEARCH INVESTIGATING THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFICACY OF SUCH TREATMENTS FOR TARGETING THE UNDERLYING PSYCHOBIOLOGY OF PERSISTENT PAIN. METHODS: THIS STUDY WAS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRAIL (RCT) COMPARING THE EFFICACY OF BIKRAM YOGA VERSUS HIGH INTENSITY INTERVAL TRAINING (HIIT), FOR IMPROVING PERSISTENT PAIN IN WOMEN AGED 20 TO 50 YEARS. THE PARTICIPANTS WERE 1:1 RANDOMIZED TO ATTEND THEIR ASSIGNED INTERVENTION, 3 TIMES PER WEEK, FOR 8 WEEKS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS THE BRIEF PAIN INVENTORY (BPI) AND FURTHER PAIN RELATED BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL SECONDARY OUTCOMES, INCLUDING SF-36 MEDICAL OUTCOMES AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV), WERE ALSO EXPLORED. DATA WAS COLLECTED PRE (T0) AND POST (T1) INTERVENTION VIA AN ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRE AND PHYSIOLOGICAL TESTING. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 34 WOMEN WERE RECRUITED FROM THE COMMUNITY. ANALYSES USING ANCOVA DEMONSTRATED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN BPI (SEVERITY PLUS INTERFERENCE) SCORES BETWEEN THE BIKRAM YOGA (N = 17) AND THE HIIT (N = 15). WOMEN IN THE BIKRAM YOGA GROUP DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED SF-36 SUBSCALE PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING: [ANCOVA: F(1, 29) = 6.17, P = .019, PARTIAL ETA-SQUARED EFFECT SIZE (ETAP(2)) = .175 AND MENTAL HEALTH: F(1, 29) = 9.09, P = .005, ETAP(2) = .239; AND INCREASED HEART RATE VARIABILITY (SDNN): F(1, 29) = 5.12, P = .013, ETAP(2) = .150, SCORES COMPARED TO THE HIIT GROUP. ACROSS BOTH GROUPS, PAIN WAS SHOWN TO DECREASE, NO INJURIES WERE EXPERIENCED AND RETENTION RATES WERE 94% FOR BIKRAM YOGA AND 75% FOR HIIT . CONCLUSIONS: BIKRAM YOGA DOES NOT APPEAR A SUPERIOR EXERCISE COMPARED TO HIIT FOR PERSISTENT PAIN. HOWEVER, IMPORVEMENTS IN QUALITY OF LIFE MEASURES AND INDICATOR OF BETTER HEALTH WERE SEEN IN THE BIKRAM YOGA GROUP. THE OUTCOMES OF THE PRESENT STUDY SUGGEST VIGOROUS EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS IN PERSISTENT PAIN COHORTS ARE FEASIBLE.

5 1861  39 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF BIKRAM YOGA AND AEROBIC EXERCISE FOR DEPRESSION IN WOMEN: EFFICACY AND STRESS-BASED MECHANISMS. BACKGROUND: THE CURRENT STUDY PRESENTS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED 8-WEEK TRIAL OF BIKRAM YOGA, AEROBIC EXERCISE, AND WAITLIST FOR DEPRESSION. BIKRAM YOGA WAS CHOSEN SPECIFICALLY FOR ITS STANDARDIZED NATURE. FURTHER, WE EXAMINED CHANGES IN THREE STRESS-RELATED CONSTRUCTS-PERCEIVED STRESS, RUMINATION, AND MINDFULNESS-AS MEDIATORS OF ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFECTS. METHOD: FIFTY-THREE WOMEN (AGE 18-65; 74% WHITE) WITH A UNIPOLAR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THE THREE CONDITIONS. RESPONSE WAS DEFINED AS >50% REDUCTION ON THE HAMILTON RATING SCALE FOR DEPRESSION (HAM-D). REMISSION WAS DEFINED AS NO LONGER MEETING CRITERIA FOR DEPRESSION AND A HAM-D </= 7. SELF-REPORTED PERCEIVED STRESS, RUMINATION, AND MINDFULNESS WERE ASSESSED WEEKLY. RESULTS: IN THE INTENTION-TO-TREAT SAMPLE (N = 53), RESPONSE RATES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN THE BIKRAM YOGA (61.1%; CHI(2) = 10.48, P = .001) AND AEROBIC EXERCISE (60.0%; CHI(2) = 10.44, P = .001) CONDITIONS RELATIVE TO WAITLIST (6.7%). IN THE COMPLETER SAMPLE (N = 42), 73.3% (CHI(2) = 11.41, P = .001) OF WOMEN IN YOGA AND 80.0% (CHI(2) = 13.72, P < .001) IN EXERCISE ACHIEVED RESPONSE COMPARED TO 8.3% IN WAITLIST. REDUCTIONS IN RUMINATION SIGNIFICANTLY MEDIATED HAM-D CHANGE FOR BOTH ACTIVE TREATMENTS, AND MINDFUL ACCEPTANCE WAS A PARTIAL MEDIATOR IN THE EXERCISE CONDITION. LIMITATIONS: THE SAMPLE WAS SMALL IN SIZE, CONSISTED OF WOMEN ONLY, AND WAS ETHNICALLY HOMOGENOUS. INTER-RATER RELIABILITY WAS NOT ASSESSED, AEROBIC EXERCISE WAS NOT STANDARDIZED, AND MEDIATORS WERE ASSESSED BY SELF-REPORT. CONCLUSIONS: BIKRAM YOGA SHOWED DESCRIPTIVELY SIMILAR EFFICACY TO AEROBIC EXERCISE AND BOTH MAY WORK, IN PART, BY HELPING INDIVIDUALS INTERRUPT NEGATIVE THINKING.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
6 1314  32 HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES AFTER THE MERGING YOGA AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE PROGRAM: A MIXED-METHODS STUDY. BACKGROUND: TO UNDERSTAND CHANGES IN HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) AFTER THE MERGING YOGA AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE (MY-OT FOR PD) PROGRAM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE USED A MIXED-METHODS CONVERGENT DESIGN AND ADMINISTERED THE PARKINSON'S DISEASE QUESTIONNAIRE-8 (PDQ-8), A MEASURE OF HRQOL, WITH 17 PARTICIPANTS. WE CONSIDERED SCORES 8 WEEKS BEFORE MY-OT FOR PD, JUST BEFORE, AND UPON COMPLETION. ADDITIONALLY, WE COMPLETED TWO FOCUS GROUPS FOLLOWING THE PROGRAM WITH 16 PARTICIPANTS TO ASSESS QUALITATIVE CHANGES IN HRQOL. RESULTS: THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN PDQ-8 SCORES BETWEEN TIME POINTS, F(2,32) = 1.60, P = 0.22, PARTIAL ETA(2) = 0.09. PARTICIPANTS DID DISCUSS IMPROVEMENTS IN ALL 8 HRQOL DOMAINS, FREQUENTLY REGARDING MOBILITY AND ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING. CONCLUSION: RESULTS DIVERGED, WITH QUANTITATIVE RESULTS SHOWING NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN HRQOL AND QUALITATIVE RESULTS INDICATING PARTICIPANT PERCEIVED IMPROVEMENTS IN ALL DOMAINS OF THE PDQ-8. THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE EXPLORED FURTHER, AND LONGITUDINAL FOLLOW-UP COMPLETED.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
7  901  35 EFFECTIVENESS OF A BRIEF ADJUNCTIVE YOGA INTERVENTION FOR SHORT-TERM MOOD AND PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOM CHANGE DURING PARTIAL HOSPITALIZATION. OBJECTIVE: EVIDENCE CONCERNING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN PARTIAL HOSPITAL PROGRAMS IS LIMITED. YET, PARTIAL HOSPITALS PROVIDE TREATMENT AT A CRITICAL JUNCTURE BY BRIDGING INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT CARE. THE PRESENT STUDY TESTED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A SINGLE-SESSION GROUP YOGA INTERVENTION FOR SHORT-TERM MOOD AND PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOM CHANGE IN PARTICIPANTS ATTENDING A 1- TO 2-WEEK PARTIAL HOSPITAL PROGRAM. METHOD: PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED 104 PARTIAL HOSPITAL PATIENTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE SINGLE-SESSION YOGA INTERVENTION AND COMPLETED A MEASURE OF POSITIVE/NEGATIVE AFFECT BEFORE AND AFTER THE GROUP. PARTICIPANTS, AS WELL AS PARTIAL HOSPITAL PATIENTS WHO DID NOT ATTEND THE YOGA INTERVENTION (N = 438), COMPLETED MEASURES OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AT ADMISSION AND DISCHARGE FROM THE PROGRAM. AT DISCHARGE, THEY ALSO RATED THEIR PERCEIVED IMPROVEMENT AND THE OVERALL QUALITY OF THE CARE THEY RECEIVED. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS WHO ATTENDED THE YOGA INTERVENTION EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECT DURING THE GROUP. THEY DID NOT SHOW GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY OR DEPRESSION OVER THE COURSE OF TREATMENT COMPARED TO INDIVIDUALS WHO DID NOT ATTEND THE GROUP. YOGA INTERVENTION PARTICIPANTS NONETHELESS GAVE HIGHER RATINGS TO THE QUALITY OF THE CARE THEY RECEIVED. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: FINDINGS DEMONSTRATED THAT ATTENDING A SINGLE YOGA SESSION DURING PARTIAL HOSPITALIZATION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SHORT-TERM MOOD BENEFITS, AND WITH ENHANCED OVERALL PERCEPTIONS OF TREATMENT. FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH PARTICIPATION IN YOGA DURING PARTIAL HOSPITALIZATION COULD CONTRIBUTE TO SYMPTOM CHANGE IN THIS CONTEXT.

8 1783  34 PREDICTORS OF HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN INDIANS WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME UNDERGOING RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION VS DIETARY INTERVENTION. THE PRESENT STUDY EXPLORES THE EFFICACY OF 12-WEEK YOGA + DIET-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION (YBLI) VS DIETARY INTERVENTION (DI) ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) AND IDENTIFIES THE PREDICTORS OF CHANGE IN HRQOL IN INDIANS WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME (MET S). DATA FROM THE HISTORICAL RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS USED INCLUDING ADULTS (N = 260, 20-45 YEARS) WITH MET S. FOUR DOMAINS OF HRQOL WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE, 2 AND 12 WEEKS USING WHOQOL-BREF QUESTIONNAIRE. GENERALIZED ESTIMATING EQUATION AND CHI-SQUARE TEST WAS USED TO COMPARE 12-WEEK CHANGES IN HRQOL DOMAINS AND PROPORTION OF SUBJECTS, RESPECTIVELY. CHANGES IN HRQOL WERE PREDICTED USING REGRESSION MODELS CONCERNING CHANGES IN BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, TOTAL CALORIE INTAKE, ADIPONECTIN, AND SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE (SOD) LEVELS. EXPLORATORY MEDIATION ANALYSIS WAS CARRIED OUT USING BARON & KENNY APPROACH. YBLI RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER INCREASE IN THE PHYSICAL DOMAIN SCORE OF HRQOL THAN DI. A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER PROPORTION OF SUBJECTS IN YBLI GROUP (71%) SHOWED AN INCREASE IN PHYSICAL DOMAIN SCORES COMPARED TO DI (51%). A UNIT CHANGE IN BMI NEGATIVELY PREDICTED A UNIT CHANGE IN PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH. WHEREAS, A UNIT CHANGE IN ADIPONECTIN AND SOD LEVELS POSITIVELY PREDICTED A UNIT CHANGE IN PHYSICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH. PARTIAL MEDIATION BETWEEN YBLI INTERVENTION AND PHYSICAL HRQOL DOMAIN WAS OBSERVED VIA ADIPONECTIN. IN CONCLUSION, A 12-WEEK YBLI HAS A POSITIVE AND GREATER EFFECT ON HRQOL PHYSICAL DOMAIN SCORE THAN FOLLOWING DI ALONE. CHANGES IN BMI, ADIPONECTIN, AND SOD LEVELS MAY PREDICT CHANGES IN HRQOL DOMAINS AFTER LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
9 2707  67 YOGA IS AS GOOD AS STRETCHING-STRENGTHENING EXERCISES IN IMPROVING FUNCTIONAL FITNESS OUTCOMES: RESULTS FROM A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: DESPITE YOGA'S POPULARITY, FEW CLINICAL TRIALS HAVE EMPLOYED RIGOROUS METHODOLOGY TO SYSTEMATICALLY EXPLORE ITS FUNCTIONAL BENEFITS COMPARED WITH MORE ESTABLISHED FORMS OF EXERCISE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE FUNCTIONAL BENEFITS OF YOGA WITH THE CONVENTIONAL STRETCHING-STRENGTHENING EXERCISES RECOMMENDED FOR ADULTS. METHODS: SEDENTARY HEALTHY ADULTS (N = 118; M AGE = 62.0) PARTICIPATED IN AN 8-WEEK (THREE TIMES A WEEK FOR 1 HOUR) RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, WHICH CONSISTED OF A HATHA YOGA GROUP (N = 61) AND A STRETCHING-STRENGTHENING EXERCISE GROUP (N = 57). STANDARDIZED FUNCTIONAL FITNESS TESTS ASSESSING BALANCE, STRENGTH, FLEXIBILITY, AND MOBILITY WERE ADMINISTERED AT BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION. RESULTS: A REPEATED MEASURES MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT TIME EFFECT FOR MEASURES OF BALANCE [F(3,18) = 4.88, P < .01, PARTIAL ETA(2) = .45], STRENGTH [F(2,19) = 15.37, P < .001, PARTIAL ETA(2) = .62], FLEXIBILITY [F(4,17) = 8.86, P < .001, PARTIAL ETA(2) = .68], AND MOBILITY [F(2,19) = 8.54, P < .002, PARTIAL ETA(2) = .47]. BOTH GROUPS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS ON MEASURES OF BALANCE (LEFT-RIGHT LEG AND FOUR SQUARE STEP); STRENGTH (CHAIR STANDS AND ARM CURLS); FLEXIBILITY (BACK SCRATCH AND SIT-AND-REACH); AND MOBILITY (GAIT SPEED AND 8-FEET UP AND GO), WITH PARTIAL ETA(2) RANGING FROM .05 TO .47. CONCLUSIONS: THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE IS JUST AS EFFECTIVE AS STRETCHING-STRENGTHENING EXERCISES IN IMPROVING FUNCTIONAL FITNESS. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY TO EXAMINE FUNCTIONAL BENEFITS OF YOGA IN COMPARISON WITH STRETCHING-STRENGTHENING EXERCISES IN SEDENTARY, HEALTHY, COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS. THESE FINDINGS HAVE CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS AS YOGA IS A MORE AMENABLE FORM OF EXERCISE THAN STRENGTHENING EXERCISES AS IT REQUIRES MINIMAL EQUIPMENT AND CAN BE ADAPTED FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH LOWER LEVELS OF FUNCTIONING OR DISABILITIES.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
10  200  48 A RESPONDER ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH COPD: WHO BENEFITS AND HOW? BACKGROUND: WE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THAT A TWICE-WEEKLY, MODIFIED IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM WAS A SAFE AND VIABLE SELF-MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD). 1 OBJECTIVE: THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THIS EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS WAS TO CLASSIFY YOGA PARTICIPANTS INTO 1 OF 3 RESPONDER CATEGORIES BY USING MINIMUM CLINICALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE (MCID) CRITERIA FOR EACH OF 3 VARIABLES: 6-MINUTE WALK DISTANCE (6MW), DISTRESS RELATED TO DYSPNEA (SHORTNESS OF BREATH; DD), AND FUNCTIONAL PERFORMANCE (FPI). CHANGES IN HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQL) AND IN PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING (ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION), AND PARTICIPANTS' SELF-REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS BY RESPONDER CATEGORY WERE ALSO EXAMINED. A SECONDARY GOAL WAS TO IDENTIFY BASELINE PARTICIPANT CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING INITIAL RANDOMIZATION ASSIGNMENT THAT MIGHT PREDICT RESPONSE TO TREATMENT. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER AN INITIAL YOGA (IY) OR AN ENHANCED WAIT-LIST CONTROL (WLC) GROUP. THOSE IN THE WLC GROUP WERE OFFERED THE YOGA PROGRAM IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE IY GROUP'S PARTICIPATION. INDIVIDUALS FROM BOTH GROUPS WHO COMPLETED AT LEAST 18 OF 24 YOGA CLASSES WERE CATEGORIZED AS RESPONDERS, PARTIAL RESPONDERS, OR NON-RESPONDERS FOR EACH OF THE 3 OUTCOME VARIABLES (6MW, DD, FPI) ON THE BASIS OF MCID CRITERIA. BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS AND CHANGES IN HRQL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING WERE ALSO ANALYZED. RESULTS: NONE OF THE PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED MCIDS FOR ALL 3 OUTCOMES; HOWEVER, 6 WERE CLASSIFIED AS RESPONDERS FOR 2 OUT-COME VARIABLES AND 4 WERE CLASSIFIED AS NON-RESPONDERS FOR ALL 3 OUTCOME VARIABLES. TWO-THIRDS OF THE FEMALE PARTICIPANT GROUP AND ONE-THIRD OF THE MALE PARTICIPANT GROUP COMPLETED THE YOGA PROGRAM. DD RESPONDERS SHOWED INCREASED ANXIETY LEVELS, WHEREAS ANXIETY LEVELS OF THE DD NON-RESPONDERS REMAINED UNCHANGED. FPI RESPONDERS REPORTED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN PHYSICAL FUNCTION, WHEREAS PARTIAL AND NON-FPI RESPONDERS NOTED DECLINED FUNCTION. PARTICIPANTS ASSIGNED TO THE IY GROUP DEMONSTRATED GREATER BENEFIT FROM YOGA THAN DID THOSE IN THE W LC GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: ALTHOUGH THIS MODIFIED IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM APPEARS TO HAVE BENEFITED SOME INDIVIDUALS WITH COPD, FURTHER STUDIES ARE REQUIRED TO ASSESS WHO THE INTERVENTION WORKS FOR AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                        
11  687  46 EFFECT OF AN OFFICE WORKSITE-BASED YOGA PROGRAM ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY: OUTCOMES OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC WORK-RELATED STRESS IS AN INDEPENDENT RISK FACTOR FOR CARDIOMETABOLIC DISEASES AND ASSOCIATED MORTALITY, PARTICULARLY WHEN COMPOUNDED BY A SEDENTARY WORK ENVIRONMENT. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE IF AN OFFICE WORKSITE-BASED HATHA YOGA PROGRAM COULD IMPROVE PHYSIOLOGICAL STRESS, EVALUATED VIA HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV), AND ASSOCIATED HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOMES IN A COHORT OF OFFICE WORKERS. METHODS: THIRTY-SEVEN ADULTS EMPLOYED IN UNIVERSITY-BASED OFFICE POSITIONS WERE RANDOMIZED UPON THE COMPLETION OF BASELINE TESTING TO AN EXPERIMENTAL OR CONTROL GROUP. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP COMPLETED A 10-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM PRESCRIBED THREE SESSIONS PER WEEK DURING LUNCH HOUR (50 MIN PER SESSION). AN EXPERIENCED INSTRUCTOR LED THE SESSIONS, WHICH EMPHASIZED ASANAS (POSTURES) AND VINYASA (EXERCISES). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS THE HIGH FREQUENCY (HF) POWER COMPONENT OF HRV. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED ADDITIONAL HRV PARAMETERS, MUSCULOSKELETAL FITNESS (I.E. PUSH-UP, SIDE-BRIDGE, AND SIT & REACH TESTS) AND PSYCHOLOGICAL INDICES (I.E. STATE AND TRAIT ANXIETY, QUALITY OF LIFE AND JOB SATISFACTION). RESULTS: ALL MEASURES OF HRV FAILED TO CHANGE IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP VERSUS THE CONTROL GROUP, EXCEPT THAT THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED LF:HF (P = 0.04) AND REDUCED PNN50 (P = 0.04) VERSUS CONTROL, CONTRARY TO OUR HYPOTHESES. FLEXIBILITY, EVALUATED VIA SIT & REACH TEST INCREASED IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP VERSUS THE CONTROL GROUP (P < 0.001). NO OTHER ADAPTATIONS WERE NOTED. POST HOC ANALYSIS COMPARING PARTICIPANTS WHO COMPLETED >/=70% OF YOGA SESSIONS (N = 11) TO CONTROL (N = 19) YIELDED THE SAME FINDINGS, EXCEPT THAT THE HIGH ADHERERS ALSO REDUCED STATE ANXIETY (P = 0.02) AND RMSSD (P = 0.05), AND TENDED TO IMPROVE THE PUSH-UP TEST (P = 0.07) VERSUS CONTROL. CONCLUSIONS: A 10-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION DELIVERED AT THE OFFICE WORKSITE DURING LUNCH HOUR DID NOT IMPROVE HF POWER OR OTHER HRV PARAMETERS. HOWEVER, IMPROVEMENTS IN FLEXIBILITY, STATE ANXIETY AND MUSCULOSKELETAL FITNESS WERE NOTED WITH HIGH ADHERENCE. FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS SHOULD INCORPORATE STRATEGIES TO PROMOTE ADHERENCE, INVOLVE MORE FREQUENT AND LONGER DURATIONS OF YOGA TRAINING, AND ENROL COHORTS WHO SUFFER FROM HIGHER LEVELS OF WORK-RELATED STRESS.

12 2132  36 THE EFFECTS OF A GENTLE YOGA PROGRAM ON SLEEP, MOOD, AND BLOOD PRESSURE IN OLDER WOMEN WITH RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS): A PRELIMINARY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE. TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA VERSUS AN EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM ON SLEEP, MOOD, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND SYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION IN OLDER WOMEN WITH RLS. METHODS. PARTICIPANTS WERE DRAWN FROM A LARGER TRIAL REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK PROFILES IN OVERWEIGHT, SEDENTARY POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. SEVENTY-FIVE WOMEN WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE EITHER AN 8-WEEK YOGA (N = 38) OR EDUCATIONAL FILM (N = 37) PROGRAM. ALL 75 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED AN RLS SCREENING QUESTIONNAIRE. THE 20 WOMEN WHO MET ALL FOUR DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR RLS (N = 10 YOGA, 10 FILM GROUP) COMPRISED THE POPULATION FOR THIS NESTED STUDY. MAIN OUTCOMES ASSESSED PRE- AND POST-TREATMENT INCLUDED: SLEEP (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX), STRESS (PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE), MOOD (PROFILE OF MOOD STATES, STATE-TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY), BLOOD PRESSURE, AND HEART RATE. RESULTS. THE YOGA GROUP DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENTS THAN CONTROLS IN MULTIPLE DOMAINS OF SLEEP QUALITY AND MOOD, AND SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER REDUCTIONS IN INSOMNIA PREVALENCE, ANXIETY, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND BLOOD PRESSURE (ALL P'S</=0.05). ADJUSTED INTERGROUP EFFECT SIZES FOR PSYCHOSOCIAL VARIABLES WERE LARGE, RANGING FROM 1.9 FOR STATE ANXIETY TO 2.6 FOR SLEEP QUALITY. CONCLUSIONS. THESE PRELIMINARY FINDINGS SUGGEST YOGA MAY OFFER AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR IMPROVING SLEEP, MOOD, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND BLOOD PRESSURE IN OLDER WOMEN WITH RLS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
13   34  48 A 12-WEEK IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM IMPROVED BALANCE AND MOBILITY IN OLDER COMMUNITY-DWELLING PEOPLE: A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: EXERCISE THAT CHALLENGES BALANCE CAN IMPROVE MOBILITY AND PREVENT FALLS IN OLDER ADULTS. YOGA AS A PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OPTION FOR OLDER ADULTS IS NOT WELL STUDIED. THIS TRIAL EVALUATED THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFECT OF A 12-WEEK IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM ON BALANCE AND MOBILITY IN OLDER PEOPLE. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A BLINDED, PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS. PARTICIPANTS WERE 54 COMMUNITY DWELLERS (MEAN AGE 68 YEARS, SD 7.1) NOT CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING IN YOGA OR TAI CHI. THE INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 27) PARTICIPATED IN A 12-WEEK, TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA PROGRAM FOCUSED ON STANDING POSTURES AND RECEIVED A FALL PREVENTION EDUCATION BOOKLET. THE CONTROL GROUP (N = 27) RECEIVED THE EDUCATION BOOKLET ONLY. PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS STANDING BALANCE COMPONENT OF THE SHORT PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE BATTERY WITH ADDITION OF ONE-LEGGED STANCE TIME (STANDING BALANCE). SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE THE TIMED SIT-TO-STAND TEST, TIMED 4-M WALK, ONE-LEGGED STAND WITH EYES CLOSED, AND SHORT FALLS EFFICACY SCALE-INTERNATIONAL. FEASIBILITY WAS MEASURED BY RECORDING CLASS ATTENDANCE AND ADVERSE EVENTS. RESULTS: FIFTY-TWO PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENTS. THE INTERVENTION GROUP SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED COMPARED WITH CONTROL GROUP ON STANDING BALANCE (MEAN DIFFERENCE = 1.52 SECONDS, 95% CI 0.10-2.96, P = .04), SIT-TO-STAND TEST (MEAN DIFFERENCE = -3.43 SECONDS, 95% CI -5.23 TO -1.64, P < .001), 4-M WALK (MEAN DIFFERENCE = -0.50 SECONDS, 95% CI -0.72 TO -0.28, P < .001), AND ONE-LEGGED STAND WITH EYES CLOSED (MEAN DIFFERENCE = 1.93 SECONDS, 95% CI 0.40-3.46, P = .02). AVERAGE CLASS ATTENDANCE WAS 20 OF 24 CLASSES (83%). NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS OCCURRED. CONCLUSIONS: THIS TRIAL DEMONSTRATES THE BALANCE AND MOBILITY-RELATED BENEFITS AND FEASIBILITY OF IYENGAR YOGA FOR OLDER PEOPLE. THE FALL PREVENTION EFFECT OF IYENGAR YOGA WARRANTS FURTHER INVESTIGATION.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
14 1781  42 PREDICTORS OF AND BARRIERS TO ADHERENCE IN A 16-WEEK RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF BIKRAM YOGA IN STRESSED AND SEDENTARY ADULTS. BACKGROUND: BIKRAM YOGA MAY ENHANCE HEALTH OUTCOMES IN HEALTHY ADULTS AND THOSE AT RISK FOR CHRONIC DISEASE, HOWEVER, CHALLENGES REMAIN IN ACHIEVING OPTIMAL ADHERENCE TO THIS PRACTICE. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED FACTORS INFLUENCING ADHERENCE TO A 16-WEEK BIKRAM YOGA INTERVENTION IN STRESSED AND SEDENTARY ADULTS. METHODS: EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PARTICIPANTS (N = 29) WERE INSTRUCTED TO ATTEND 3-5 BIKRAM YOGA CLASSES WEEKLY FOR 16 WEEKS. BASELINE DEMOGRAPHICS, BEHAVIOURS AND HEALTH MEASURES WERE INVESTIGATED AS PREDICTORS OF ADHERENCE. BARRIERS WERE ASSESSED VIA DOCUMENTATION OF ADVERSE EVENTS, AND EXIT SURVEY RESPONSES. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS (38.2 +/- 10.1 YEARS) WERE PREDOMINANTLY OVERWEIGHT-OBESE (83%), FEMALE (79%), AND ATTENDED 27 +/- 18 CLASSES. HIGHER ADHERENCE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH OLDER AGE (P = 0.094), LESS PAIN (P = 0.011), FEWER PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS (P = 0.011), POORER BLOOD LIPID PROFILE, AND HIGHER HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV; TOTAL POWER, (P = 0.097)). IN MULTI-VARIABLE ANALYSIS, THREE VARIABLES: AGE (BETA = 0.492, P = 0.006), HRV (BETA = 0.413, P = 0.021) AND PAIN (BETA = 0.329, P = 0.048) REMAINED PREDICTORS OF ADHERENCE. DIFFICULTY COMMITTING TO THE TRIAL, LACK OF ENJOYMENT AND ADVERSE EVENTS WERE BARRIERS TO ADHERENCE. CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF FUTURE BIKRAM YOGA TRIALS TO FACILITATE HIGHER LEVELS OF ADHERENCE, WHICH MAY ENHANCE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND INFORM COMMUNITY PRACTICE. FUTURE TRIALS SHOULD INVESTIGATE AND ADDRESS ADDITIONAL BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS OF BIKRAM YOGA PRACTICE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
15 2811  41 YOGA TO PREVENT MOBILITY LIMITATIONS IN OLDER ADULTS: FEASIBILITY OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: THE LOSS OF MOBILITY DURING AGING IMPACTS INDEPENDENCE AND LEADS TO FURTHER DISABILITY, MORBIDITY, AND REDUCED LIFE EXPECTANCY. OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND SAFETY OF CONDUCTING A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA FOR OLDER ADULTS AT RISK FOR MOBILITY LIMITATIONS. METHODS: SEDENTARY OLDER ADULTS (N = 46; AGE 60-89) WERE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED TO EITHER YOGA OR A HEALTH EDUCATION COMPARISON GROUP. YOGA SESSIONS (60-MIN) OCCURRED 2X WEEKLY, AND 90-MIN HEALTH EDUCATION SESSIONS OCCURRED WEEKLY, FOR 10 WEEKS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE RECRUITMENT RATE, INTERVENTION ATTENDANCE, AND RETENTION AT ASSESSMENTS. ADVERSE EVENT RATES AND PARTICIPANT SATISFACTION WERE ALSO MEASURED. PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES OF GAIT, BALANCE, AND STRENGTH AND SELF-REPORT OUTCOME MEASURES WERE ADMINISTERED AT BASELINE AND 10-WEEKS. RESULTS: RECRUITMENT LASTED 6 MONTHS. RETENTION OF PARTICIPANTS AT THE 10-WEEK FOLLOW-UP WAS HIGH (89% - PERFORMANCE MEASURES; 98% - SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES). ATTENDANCE WAS GOOD WITH 82% OF YOGA AND 74% OF HEALTH EDUCATION PARTICIPANTS ATTENDING AT LEAST 50% OF THE SESSIONS. NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. PATIENT SATISFACTION WITH THE INTERVENTIONS WAS HIGH. THE MEAN EFFECT SIZE FOR THE PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES WAS 0.35 WITH SOME OVER 0.50. THE MEAN EFFECT SIZE FOR SELF-REPORT OUTCOME MEASURES WAS 0.36. CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS INDICATE THAT IT IS FEASIBLE TO CONDUCT A LARGER RCT OF YOGA FOR SEDENTARY OLDER ADULTS AT RISK FOR MOBILITY PROBLEMS. THE YOGA AND COMPARISON INTERVENTIONS WERE SAFE, WELL ACCEPTED, AND WELL ATTENDED. EFFECT SIZES SUGGEST YOGA MAY HAVE IMPORTANT BENEFITS FOR THIS POPULATION AND SHOULD BE STUDIED FURTHER.

16  944  41 EFFECTS OF A 12-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION ON METABOLIC RISK AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN HONG KONG CHINESE ADULTS WITH AND WITHOUT METABOLIC SYNDROME. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF A 12-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE METABOLIC RISK PROFILES AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) IN CHINESE ADULTS WITH AND WITHOUT METABOLIC SYNDROME (METS). METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A CONTROLLED TRIAL WITHIN AN UNIVERSITY-AFFILIATED HOSPITAL. 173 CHINESE MEN AND WOMEN AGED 18 OR ABOVE WERE ASSIGNED TO EITHER THE YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 87) OR THE CONTROL GROUP (N = 86). PRIMARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED 12-WEEK CHANGE IN METABOLIC RISK FACTORS AND METS Z SCORE. SECONDARY OUTCOME WAS HRQOL (MEDICAL OUTCOMES SHORT FORM SURVEY AT 12 WEEKS). RESULTS: THE MEAN AGE OF PARTICIPANTS WAS 52.0 (SD 7.4, RANGE 31-71) YEARS. ANALYSIS INVOLVING THE ENTIRE STUDY POPULATION REVEALED THAT THE YOGA GROUP ACHIEVED GREATER DECLINE IN WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE (P<0.001), FASTING GLUCOSE (P<0.01), TRIGLYCERIDES (P<0.05), AND METS Z SCORE (P<0.01). YOGA TRAINING ALSO IMPROVED GENERAL HEALTH PERCEPTIONS (P<0.01), PHYSICAL COMPONENT SCORE (P<0.01), AND SOCIAL FUNCTIONING (P<0.01) DOMAINS SCORE OF HRQOL. HOWEVER, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS WERE OBSERVED IN THE MEAN CHANGE OF SYSTOLIC/DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURES OR HIGH-DENSITY LIPID PROTEIN CHOLESTEROL (ALL P>0.05). THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE INTERVENTION EFFECTS ON WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE AND METS Z SCORE BETWEEN THE METS SUBGROUPS (BOTH P>0.05). CONCLUSION: A 12-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION IMPROVES METABOLIC RISK PROFILES AND HRQOL IN CHINESE ADULTS WITH AND WITHOUT METS.

17 2667  47 YOGA IN HEART FAILURE PATIENTS: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES SUCH AS YOGA PRACTICE HAVE BECOME COMMONPLACE, YET THE SAFETY, PHYSICAL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS ON PATIENTS WITH HEART FAILURE (HF) ARE UNKNOWN. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN 8-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM WAS SAFE AND WOULD POSITIVELY INFLUENCE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION IN HF PATIENTS. METHODS AND RESULTS: STABLE HF PATIENTS WERE RECRUITED (N = 15) AND COMPLETED (N = 12) 8 WEEKS OF YOGA CLASSES. DATA COLLECTED WERE: SAFETY (CARDIAC AND ORTHOPEDIC ADVERSE EVENTS); PHYSICAL FUNCTION (STRENGTH, BALANCE, ENDURANCE, FLEXIBILITY); AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION (QUALITY OF LIFE [QOL], DEPRESSION SCORES, MINDFULNESS) BEFORE AND AFTER 8 WEEKS OF YOGA CLASSES. RESULTS: MEAN AGE WAS 52.4 + OR - 11.6 WITH THREE-FOURTHS (N = 9) BEING MALE AND CAUCASIAN. NO PARTICIPANT HAD ANY ADVERSE EVENTS. ENDURANCE (P < .02) AND STRENGTH (UPPER P = .04 AND LOWER BODY P = .01) SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED. BALANCE IMPROVED BY 13.6 SECONDS (26.9 + OR - 19.7 TO 40.0 + OR - 18.5; P = .05). SYMPTOM STABILITY, A SUBSCALE OF QOL, IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY (P = .02). ALTHOUGH NO SUBJECT WAS DEPRESSED, OVERALL MOOD WAS IMPROVED. SUBJECTS SUBJECTIVELY REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN OVERALL WELL-BEING. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA PRACTICE WAS SAFE, WITH PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCING IMPROVED PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND SYMPTOM STABILITY. LARGER STUDIES ARE WARRANTED TO PROVIDE MORE NONPHARMACOLOGICAL OPTIONS FOR IMPROVED OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS WITH HF.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
18 1130  37 EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR DEPRESSED POSTPARTUM WOMEN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: UP TO 20% OF WOMEN EXPERIENCE POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION (PPD). PPD IS ASSOCIATED WITH ANXIETY AND POOR HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL). EFFICACIOUS TREATMENTS ARE CRITICAL; MANY WOMEN WITH PPD PREFER COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES. THUS, THE CURRENT STUDY EXAMINED YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR PPD. METHODS: FIFTY-SEVEN POSTPARTUM WOMEN WITH SCORES >/=12 ON THE HAMILTON DEPRESSION RATING SCALE WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A YOGA (N = 28) OR WAIT-LIST CONTROL (N = 29) GROUP. THE YOGA INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF 16 CLASSES OVER 8 WEEKS. OUTCOMES WERE DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND HRQOL. RESULTS: THE YOGA GROUP EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER RATE OF IMPROVEMENT IN DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND HRQOL, RELATIVE TO THE CONTROL GROUP WITH MODERATE TO LARGE EFFECTS. RELIABLE CHANGE INDEX ANALYSES REVEALED THAT 78% OF WOMEN IN THE YOGA GROUP EXPERIENCED CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. CONCLUSION: THESE FINDINGS SUPPORT YOGA AS A PROMISING COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR PPD, AND WARRANT LARGE-SCALE REPLICATION STUDIES.

19 1379  40 IMPACT OF IYENGAR YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE IN YOUNG WOMEN WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. OBJECTIVE: RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA) IS A CHRONIC, DISABLING DISEASE THAT CAN GREATLY COMPROMISE HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL). THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF A 6-WEEK TWICE/WEEK IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM ON HRQOL OF YOUNG ADULTS WITH RA COMPARED WITH A USUAL-CARE WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP. METHODS: THE PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE PRIMARY OUTCOME OF HRQOL INCLUDING PAIN AND DISABILITY AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONING IN PATIENTS. ASSESSMENTS WERE COLLECTED PRETREATMENT, POSTTREATMENT, AND AT 2 MONTHS AFTER TREATMENT. WEEKLY RATINGS OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, PAIN, AND SLEEP WERE ALSO RECORDED. A TOTAL OF 26 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE INTERVENTION (YOGA=11; USUAL-CARE WAITLIST=15). ALL PARTICIPANTS WERE FEMALE (MEAN AGE=28 Y). RESULTS: OVERALL ATTRITION WAS LOW AT 15%. ON AVERAGE, WOMEN IN THE YOGA GROUP ATTENDED 96% OF THE YOGA CLASSES. NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. RELATIVE TO THE USUAL-CARE WAITLIST, WOMEN ASSIGNED TO THE YOGA PROGRAM SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENT ON STANDARDIZED MEASURES OF HRQOL, PAIN DISABILITY, GENERAL HEALTH, MOOD, FATIGUE, ACCEPTANCE OF CHRONIC PAIN, AND SELF-EFFICACY REGARDING PAIN AT POSTTREATMENT. ALMOST HALF OF THE YOGA GROUP REPORTED CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL SYMPTOM IMPROVEMENT. ANALYSIS OF THE UNCONTROLLED EFFECTS AND MAINTENANCE OF TREATMENT EFFECTS SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS IN HRQOL GENERAL HEALTH, PAIN DISABILITY, AND WEEKLY RATINGS OF PAIN, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION WERE MAINTAINED AT FOLLOW-UP. CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT A BRIEF IYENGAR YOGA INTERVENTION IS A FEASIBLE AND SAFE ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WITH RA, LEADING TO HRQOL, PAIN DISABILITY, FATIGUE, AND MOOD BENEFITS. MOREOVER, IMPROVEMENTS IN QUALITY OF LIFE, PAIN DISABILITY, AND MOOD PERSISTED AT THE 2-MONTH FOLLOW-UP.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
20 1527  37 IYENGAR YOGA FOR DISTRESSED WOMEN: A 3-ARMED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. DISTRESS IS AN INCREASING PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM. WE AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF AN IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM ON PERCEIVED STRESS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES IN DISTRESSED WOMEN AND EVALUATED A POTENTIAL DOSE-EFFECT RELATIONSHIP. SEVENTY-TWO FEMALE DISTRESSED SUBJECTS WERE INCLUDED INTO A 3-ARMED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL AND ALLOCATED TO YOGA GROUP 1 (N = 24) WITH TWELVE 90 MIN SESSIONS OVER 3 MONTHS, YOGA GROUP 2 (N = 24) WITH 24 SESSIONS OVER 3 MONTHS, OR A WAITING LIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 24). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS STRESS PERCEPTION, MEASURED BY COHEN STRESS SCALE; SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED STATE TRAIT ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), PROFILE OF MOOD STATES, WELL BEING, AND BODILY COMPLAINTS. AFTER THREE MONTHS, WOMEN IN THE YOGA GROUPS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN PERCEIVED STRESS (P = 0.003), STATE TRAIT ANXIETY (P = 0.021 AND P = 0.003), DEPRESSION (P = 0.008), PSYCHOLOGICAL QOL (P = 0.012), MOOD STATES BEING (P = 0.007), AND BODILY COMPLAINTS WELL(P = 0.012) WHEN COMPARED TO CONTROLS. BOTH YOGA PROGRAMS WERE SIMILARLY EFFECTIVE FOR THESE OUTCOMES; HOWEVER, COMPLIANCE WAS BETTER IN THE GROUP WITH FEWER SESSIONS (YOGA GROUP 1). DOSE EFFECTS WERE SEEN ONLY IN THE ANALYSIS OF GROUP-INDEPENDENT EFFECTS FOR BACK PAIN, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT IYENGAR YOGA EFFECTIVELY REDUCES DISTRESS AND IMPROVES RELATED PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL OUTCOMES. FURTHERMORE, ATTENDING TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES WAS NOT SUPERIOR TO ONCE-WEEKLY CLASSES, AS A RESULT OF LIMITED COMPLIANCE IN THE TWICE-WEEKLY GROUP.	2012

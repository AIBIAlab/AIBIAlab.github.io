1  150 87 A QUALITATIVE INVESTIGATION OF A PRENATAL YOGA INTERVENTION TO PREVENT EXCESSIVE GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN: A THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF INTERVIEWS. PURPOSE: TO DESCRIBE PREGNANT WOMEN'S EXPERIENCES AND PERCEIVED FACILITATORS/BARRIERS OF A PRENATAL YOGA INTERVENTION TO PREVENT EXCESSIVE GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN (EGWG). METHODS: PREGNANT WOMEN (N = 13) WERE INTERVIEWED AFTER PARTICIPATION IN A 12-WEEK PRENATAL YOGA INTERVENTION TO PREVENT EGWG. INTERVIEWS WERE SUMMARIZED USING THEMATIC ANALYSIS. RESULTS: TWELVE THEMES WERE IDENTIFIED AND ORGANIZED INTO FOUR CATEGORIES: 1) EXPERIENCES OF PRENATAL YOGA (POSITIVE EXPERIENCE/ENJOYMENT, PAIN RELIEF, CONNECTING TO BODY), 2) PRENATAL YOGA AND WEIGHT (INCREASED MINDFULNESS/SELF-AWARENESS, INCREASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, WEIGHT MANAGEMENT), 3) BARRIERS TO PRENATAL YOGA (PHYSICAL BODY, COMMUTE/TRAFFIC, SCHEDULE), AND 4) FACILITATORS OF PRENATAL YOGA (HEALTHY PREGNANCY, SUPPORT FROM OTHER PREGNANT WOMEN, THE FEELING FROM PRENATAL YOGA). CONCLUSION: PRENATAL YOGA MAY RELIEVE PAIN AND HELP WOMEN BE MORE CONNECTED TO THEIR BODIES. PRENATAL YOGA MAY ALSO HELP WOMEN BECOME MORE AWARE OF THEIR HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND INCREASES THEIR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WHICH MAY HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR REDUCING EGWG.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
2   22 29 "YOGA WAS MY SAVING GRACE": THE EXPERIENCE OF WOMEN WHO PRACTICE PRENATAL YOGA. BACKGROUND: APPROXIMATELY 20% OF WOMEN IN THE UNITED STATES PRACTICE PRENATAL YOGA, BUT THERE IS A PAUCITY OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE OF THESE WOMEN. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY EXAMINES WOMEN'S EXPERIENCES PARTICIPATING IN COMMUNITY-BASED PRENATAL YOGA. METHOD: A QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTIVE EXPLORATORY DESIGN USED FOCUS GROUPS WITH A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF PREGNANT AND POSTPARTUM WOMEN (N = 14) WHO ENGAGED IN PRENATAL YOGA WITHIN THE PREVIOUS 6 MONTHS. CONTENT ANALYSIS WAS EMPLOYED TO IDENTIFY KEY THEMES AND SUBTHEMES. RESULTS: THREE THEMES AROSE: (A) STRESS AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS COMMONLY INSTIGATE WOMEN'S INTEREST IN PRENATAL YOGA, (B) PRENATAL YOGA IS PERCEIVED TO BE PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND PHYSICALLY BENEFICIAL, AND (C) PRENATAL YOGA IS PERCEIVED AS MORE BENEFICIAL THAN OTHER GROUP CLASSES. CONCLUSIONS: PREGNANT WOMEN WITH STRESS AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS MAY BE DRAWN TO PRENATAL YOGA FOR THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL BENEFITS. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND RESEARCHERS FOCUS ON THESE NEEDS, PARTICULARLY WHEN DESIGNING PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION STRATEGIES WITH THIS POPULATION.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
3 1796 17 PRENATAL YOGA IN LATE PREGNANCY AND OPTIMISM, POWER, AND WELL-BEING. THE STUDY REPORTED HERE EXPLORED CHANGES IN OPTIMISM, POWER, AND WELL-BEING OVER TIME IN WOMEN WHO PARTICIPATED IN A SIX-WEEK PRENATAL YOGA PROGRAM DURING THEIR SECOND AND THIRD TRIMESTERS OF PREGNANCY. THE STUDY WAS CONCEPTUALIZED FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF ROGERS' SCIENCE OF UNITARY HUMAN BEINGS. A CORRELATIONAL, ONE-GROUP, PRE-POST-ASSESSMENT SURVEY DESIGN WITH A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE WAS CONDUCTED. INCREASES IN MEAN SCORES FOR OPTIMISM, POWER, AND WELL-BEING WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT FROM BASELINE TO COMPLETION OF THE PRENATAL YOGA PROGRAM. FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY SUGGESTED THAT YOGA AS A SELF-CARE PRACTICE THAT NURSES MIGHT RECOMMEND TO PROMOTE WELL-BEING IN PREGNANT WOMEN.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
4 1206 37 EXPERIENCES OF PREGNANT WOMEN PARTICIPATING IN ANTENATAL YOGA: A QUALITATIVE STUDY. CONTEXT: PREGNANCY YOGA IS A MODIFIED VERSION OF YOGA FOR PREGNANT WOMEN, AND IT AIMS TO REDUCE PREGNANCY-RELATED SYMPTOMS, SUCH AS INSOMNIA, LOW BACK PAIN, TIREDNESS, CONSTIPATION, LEG CRAMPS, AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH. OBJECTIVE: THE STUDY AIMED TO IDENTIFY THE EXPERIENCES AND EXPECTATIONS OF PREGNANT WOMEN RELATED TO THE PRACTICE OF YOGA. METHOD: THE RESEARCH TEAM CONDUCTED A QUALITATIVE STUDY. SETTING: THE STUDY TOOK PLACE AT THE ANTENATAL CLINIC OF A PUBLIC HOSPITAL IN THE CENTRAL ANATOLIA REGION OF TURKEY. PARTICIPANTS: THE PARTICIPANTS WERE 24 PREGNANT WOMEN AT THE CLINIC. INTERVENTION: THE STUDY INCLUDED AN INTERVENTION GROUP THAT PERFORMED YOGA AND RECEIVED ROUTINE ANTENATAL CARE; HOWEVER, NO CONTROL GROUPS WERE USED. EACH YOGA INTERVENTION WAS HELD FOR APPROXIMATELY 40-45 MINUTES, WITH YOGA ASANA PERIODS LASTING 30 MINUTES. THE PREGNANT WOMEN WERE EXPECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN YOGA PRACTICE TWICE A WEEK ON A REGULAR BASIS FOR 8 WEEKS. OUTCOME MEASURES: DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS. THE INTERVIEWS WERE RECORDED AND TRANSCRIBED VERBATIM AND THEMATIC ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED. RESULTS: FOUR MAJOR THEMES EMERGED: (1) PERCEPTIONS ABOUT PREGNANCY, (2) MANAGEMENT OF PREGNANCY SYMPTOMS, (3) PRENATAL ATTACHMENT, AND (4) BIRTH PERCEPTIONS. ACCORDING TO PARTICIPANTS, THE BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE WERE MANAGEMENT OF PREGNANCY SYMPTOMS, INCREASED PRENATAL ATTACHMENT, A POSITIVE PERCEPTION OF THE BIRTH, NATURAL-BIRTH BELIEFS, AND MANAGEMENT OF FEAR AND PAIN DURING BIRTH. CONCLUSIONS: THE PARTICIPANTS REPORTED BARRIERS TO PERFORMING YOGA; HOWEVER, THEY ALSO SAID THAT THEY WOULD TRY PREGNANCY YOGA IF THEY WERE ENCOURAGED BY HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS. ALSO, THE PARTICIPANTS STATED THAT PREGNANCY YOGA PRACTICE SHOULD BE MADE A PART OF ANTENATAL EDUCATION TO FACILITATE PARTICIPATION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
5 1217 29 EXPLORING THE IMPACTS OF MINDFULNESS AND YOGA UPON CHILDBIRTH OUTCOMES AND MATERNAL HEALTH: AN INTEGRATIVE REVIEW. BACKGROUND: FOETAL DEVELOPMENT AND THE LONG-TERM OUTCOMES OF THE INFANT ARE INFLUENCED BY THE INTRAUTERINE ENVIRONMENT. STRATEGIES TO ENHANCE MATERNAL HEALTH IN PREGNANCY ARE NEEDED TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR CHILDBEARING WOMEN AND BABIES, ADVANCING THE WELL-BEING OF OUR GENERAL POPULATION. AIM: TO SYNTHESISE THE EXISTING LITERATURE TO DETERMINE THE IMPACTS OF MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PRACTICE UPON BIRTH OUTCOMES AND MATERNAL HEALTH. METHODS: AN INTEGRATIVE LITERATURE REVIEW USING WHITTEMORE AND KNAFL'S FRAMEWORK WAS UNDERTAKEN IN 2016-2017. TWO SEARCH STRATEGIES INCLUDED DATABASE PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL ARTICLES AND ANCESTRY SEARCHING, THAT IS EXPLORING THE REFERENCE LIST OF RELEVANT RESEARCH ARTICLES. AFTER SCREENING AND CHECKING THE ELIGIBILITY, A TOTAL OF 12 ARTICLES WERE INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW. DATA ANALYSIS INVOLVED CODING, VISUAL DISPLAYS, THEMATIC ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON, AND CONCLUSION DRAWING. RESULTS: THE RESULTS OF THIS REVIEW IDENTIFIED A BROAD THEME THAT MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PRACTICE IS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH ANTENATALLY AND POSTNATALLY. SUBTHEMES HAVE BEEN PRESENTED UNDER THE CENTRAL THEME INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING: INCREASED MINDFULNESS CORRELATES WITH DECREASED FEAR OF CHILDBIRTH; REDUCED SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION; AND SUPPORTIVE GROUP SETTINGS FOUND TO BE BENEFICIAL BY PREGNANT WOMEN. CONCLUSION: THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN THIS REVIEW SUGGESTS THAT MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PRACTICE ARE FEASIBLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS TO ENHANCE MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH, PARTICULARLY FOR WOMEN EXPERIENCING MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES. MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PRACTISED REGULARLY IN THE ANTENATAL PERIOD CAN SIGNIFICANTLY PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF PREGNANT WOMEN AND POTENTIALLY THEIR DEVELOPING BABIES.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
6 1774 27 PRACTICE AND ACCEPTABILITY OF YOGA AMONG PREGNANT WOMEN IN INDIA: A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY. THE PRACTICE OF YOGA IS BENEFICIAL DURING PREGNANCY, BUT WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT PROPORTION OF PREGNANT WOMEN IN INDIA PRACTICE YOGA. TO ADDRESS THIS RESEARCH GAP, WE CONDUCTED A STUDY TO ADDRESS FOLLOWING RESEARCH QUESTIONS: (1) WHAT PROPORTION OF PREGNANT WOMEN IN RURAL MAHARASHTRA PRACTICE YOGA? (2) WHICH SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRACTICE OF YOGA AMONG THESE WOMEN? AND (3) WHAT IS THE PERCEIVED ACCEPTABILITY OF INTEGRATING YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION INTO ROUTINE ANTENATAL CARE? A CONSECUTIVE SAMPLE OF PREGNANT WOMEN ATTENDING THE ANTENATAL CLINIC OF A TERTIARY CARE HOSPITAL, WHO COULD FLUENTLY COMMUNICATE IN MARATHI AND WHO DID NOT HAVE ANY SERIOUS PHYSICAL ILLNESS OR COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, WERE INCLUDED IN THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY. A TOTAL OF 228 SUBJECTS WERE INCLUDED IN OUR STUDY. YOGA WAS PRACTICED BY 38 OF THEM (16.7%, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL 12.1-22.1) DURING THE CURRENT PREGNANCY. OLDER AGE, HIGHER EDUCATION, AND BEING A PROFESSIONAL (TEACHER, HEALTHCARE PROVIDER, OR BANK OFFICIAL) WERE ASSOCIATED WITH PRACTICE OF YOGA. MORE THAN HALF OF THE PARTICIPANTS (53.9%) THOUGHT THAT YOGA SHOULD BE INCLUDED AS PART OF THEIR ANTENATAL CARE; THIS PERCEIVED ACCEPTABILITY OF YOGA WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH ANY OF THE SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS EXCEPT FOR THE PARTICIPANTS' OCCUPATION. THIS STUDY PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE PREVALENCE AND SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRACTICE OF YOGA AMONG PREGNANT WOMEN IN A RURAL SETTING IN INDIA. IT ALSO EXPLORES THE PERCEIVED ACCEPTABILITY OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS AMONG THIS GROUP. FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY CAN INFORM DESIGN OF FUTURE STUDIES TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS DURING PREGNANCY.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
7 1577 35 MEANINGS AND PERCEPTIONS OF WOMEN REGARDING THE PRACTICE OF YOGA IN PREGNANCY: A QUALITATIVE STUDY. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CONSIDERING THAT PREGNANCY TRIGGERS PROFOUND TRANSFORMATIONS IN THE LIFE EXPERIENCE OF WOMEN, AMONG THEM THE NEED TO ADAPT TO A BODY IN A CONSTANT PROCESS OF PHYSIOLOGICAL, PSYCHIC, SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL CHANGE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY TO WHAT EXTENT YOGA CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THIS PROCESS. FOR THIS REASON, THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO COMPREHEND THE MEANINGS AND PERCEPTIONS OF WOMEN REGARDING THE PRACTICE OF YOGA DURING PREGNANCY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A QUALITATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT WITH NINE WOMEN AT DIFFERENT GESTATIONAL AGES WHO WERE PRACTICING YOGA IN PLACES WITH ALTERNATIVE AND INTEGRATIVE THERAPIES FOR PREGNANT WOMEN LOCATED IN SAO PAULO, BRAZIL. DATA COLLECTION WAS PERFORMED THROUGH SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS AND THE WOMEN'S STATEMENTS WERE TRANSCRIBED, ANALYSED AND GROUPED INTO THREE THEMATIC CATEGORIES. RESULTS: THE ANALYSIS OF THE INTERVIEWS ALLOWED THE IDENTIFICATION OF THREE CATEGORIES 'BENEFITS OF PRACTICING YOGA', 'SELF-KNOWLEDGE, AUTONOMY AND SELF-CARE' AND 'EMPOWERMENT FOR THE MOMENT OF THE BIRTH'. THESE FINDINGS ALLOWED US TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE WOMEN PERCEIVED THE PRACTICE OF YOGA IN THE PREGNANCY AND CONSIDERED IT FUNDAMENTAL TO THE RECOGNITION THAT THEY WERE COMPETENT AND SKILLED TO MANAGE AND CONTROL THEIR BODIES DURING CHILDBIRTH. CONCLUSION: IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE PRACTICE OF YOGA PROVIDED PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL BENEFITS FOR THE WOMEN OF THIS STUDY, INCLUDING STRENGTHENING OF THE PELVIC FLOOR, PAIN RELIEF, IMPROVEMENT OF BREATHING, REDUCTION OF STRESS AND ANXIETY, AND STRENGTHENING OF SELF-CONFIDENCE, SELF-ESTEEM AND AUTONOMY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE PREGNANCY AND IN CARING FOR THEMSELVES.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
8   27 24 'IT DEFINITELY MADE A DIFFERENCE': A GROUNDED THEORY STUDY OF YOGA FOR PREGNANCY AND WOMEN'S SELF-EFFICACY FOR LABOUR. OBJECTIVE: TO EXPLORE WOMEN'S EXPERIENCE OF ATTENDING YOGA FOR PREGNANCY CLASSES IN ORDER TO GENERATE A THEORY ABOUT WHICH ASPECTS, IF ANY, ARE EFFECTIVE IN ENHANCING SELF-EFFICACY FOR LABOUR AND BIRTH. DESIGN: A LONGITUDINAL GROUNDED THEORY STUDY. METHODS: SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE UNDERTAKEN WITH WOMEN BEFORE THEY STARTED YOGA FOR PREGNANCY CLASSES, AFTER THEY HAD ATTENDED AT LEAST SIX CLASSES, AND FINALLY, POSTNATALLY. INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTS WERE ANALYSED USING CONSTRUCTIVE GROUNDED THEORY AND A SELF-EFFICACY FRAMEWORK. SETTING: THREE YOGA FOR PREGNANCY TEACHERS' CLASSES IN ENGLAND. PARTICIPANTS: TWENTY TWO WOMEN ATTENDING YOGA FOR PREGNANCY CLASSES. FINDINGS: ANALYSIS OF INTERVIEWS WITH WOMEN AT THREE TIME POINTS LED TO A PROPOSITIONAL THEORY THAT YOGA FOR PREGNANCY ENHANCES WOMEN'S SELF-EFFICACY FOR LABOUR BY BUILDING THEIR CONFIDENCE AND COMPETENCE THROUGH A COMBINATION OF TECHNIQUES. THESE INCLUDE REPEATED PRACTICE OF A VARIETY OF PAIN MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES, USE OF AFFIRMING LANGUAGE AND THE TELLING OF POSITIVE LABOUR STORIES, UNDERPINNED BY YOGA PRACTICE TO LOWER SOMATIC RESPONSE TO STRESS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
9 1712 23 PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF YOGA AMONG URBAN SCHOOL STUDENTS: A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS. THIS STUDY REPORTS ON THE FINDINGS OF A QUALITATIVE EVALUATION OF A YOGA INTERVENTION PROGRAM FOR URBAN MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL YOUTH IN NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC AND CHARTER SCHOOLS. SIX FOCUS GROUPS WERE CONDUCTED WITH STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN A YEAR-LONG YOGA PROGRAM TO DETERMINE THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL BENEFITS AS WELL AS BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES. RESULTS SHOW THAT STUDENTS PERCEIVED THE BENEFITS OF YOGA AS INCREASED SELF-REGULATION, MINDFULNESS, SELF-ESTEEM, PHYSICAL CONDITIONING, ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE, AND STRESS REDUCTION. BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES FOR A YOGA PRACTICE INCLUDE LACK OF TIME AND SPACE. THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE BENEFITS EXPERIENCED ARE INTERRELATED TO ONE ANOTHER IS DISCUSSED. SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH AND SCHOOL-BASED PROGRAMMING ARE ALSO OFFERED.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
10 1213 30 EXPLORING PERCEIVED BENEFITS, MOTIVES, BARRIERS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRESCRIBING YOGA EXERCISES AS A NONPHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION FOR PATIENTS WITH EPILEPSY: A QUALITATIVE STUDY FROM PALESTINE. OBJECTIVES: YOGA IS BELIEVED TO PLAY A ROLE IN STABILIZING THE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM AND THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM, THUS MIGHT HELP CONTROL SEIZURES IN PEOPLE WITH EPILEPSY (PWE). THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO EXPLORE EXPERIENCES OF PALESTINIAN PWE WITH REGARD TO BENEFITS, MOTIVES, BARRIERS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF PRESCRIBING YOGA EXERCISES AS A NONPHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION. METHODS: PURPOSIVE AND SNOWBALL SAMPLING TECHNIQUES WERE USED TO RECRUIT PWE WHO PRACTICED YOGA. SEMI-STRUCTURED IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS (N=18) WERE CONDUCTED WITH THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS. THE INTERPRETIVE DESCRIPTION METHOD WAS USED TO QUALITATIVELY ANALYZE THE DATA COLLECTED DURING THE INTERVIEWS. RESULTS: FOLLOWING THE THEMATIC ANALYSIS ADOPTED FOR THIS STUDY, FOUR MAJOR THEMES EMERGED. THESE THEMES WERE AS FOLLOWS: PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF YOGA, MOTIVES TO PRACTICE YOGA, BARRIERS TO PRACTICE YOGA, AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON EFFECTIVE YOGA PRACTICE FOR PWE. THE PERCEIVED BENEFITS INCLUDED IMPROVEMENTS IN MANAGEMENT OF SEIZURES, PSYCHOLOGICAL, PHYSICAL, AND SOCIAL WELL-BEING. PEOPLE WITH EPILEPSY WERE MOTIVATED BY THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF YOGA. BARRIERS OF ADHERENCE TO PRACTICE INCLUDED PERSONAL AND LOGISTIC FACTORS. THE INTERVIEWEES RECOMMENDED TAILORING YOGA SESSIONS TO THE NEEDS OF PWE. CONCLUSION: THIS EXPLORATIVE QUALITATIVE STUDY REPORTED PERCEIVED BENEFITS, MOTIVES, BARRIERS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF YOGA AS A NONPHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION FOR PWE. PEOPLE WITH EPILEPSY USED YOGA AS A BENEFICIAL NONPHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH AND REDUCE THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF EPILEPSY ON THEIR PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL-BEING. FUTURE STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO INVESTIGATE THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF YOGA WHEN SESSIONS ARE TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF PWE.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                  
11 1151 31 ENHANCING ACCESSIBILITY OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY DURING PREGNANCY: A PILOT STUDY ON WOMEN'S EXPERIENCES WITH INTEGRATING YOGA INTO GROUP PRENATAL CARE. INTRODUCTION: HEALTH GUIDELINES SUGGEST THAT PREGNANT WOMEN SHOULD PARTICIPATE IN DAILY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, YET RARELY DO THEY MEET THESE GUIDELINES. MEANS TO ENHANCE ACCESSIBILITY OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOR PREGNANT WOMEN ARE REQUIRED, AND YOGA HAS BEEN SUGGESTED AS A POSSIBLE METHOD TO ENHANCE WOMEN'S SENSE OF CONFIDENCE AND COMPETENCE WITH PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. IN THIS PILOT STUDY, OUR PRIMARY AIM IS TO EVALUATE PREGNANT WOMEN'S PERCEPTIONS ABOUT THEIR LIVED EXPERIENCE OF AN INTERVENTION WHICH INTEGRATES A LOW-INTENSITY FORM OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, YOGA, INTO PRENATAL CARE; OUR SECONDARY AIM IS TO EVALUATE CHANGES IN PARTICIPANTS' SELF-EFFICACY FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND TIME SPENT IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OVER TIME. METHODS: HELD IN AN OUTPATIENT OBSTETRICS DEPARTMENT OF AN URBAN HOSPITAL SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES, THIS PILOT STUDY ENROLLED 16 PREGNANT WOMEN TO PARTICIPATE IN THE INTERVENTION THROUGHOUT THEIR PREGNANCY. WE EXPLORED PARTICIPANTS' LIVED EXPERIENCE OF THE INTERVENTION USING QUALITATIVE METHODS (PHENOMENOLOGY). MEANS, VARIANCES, AND COVARIANCES WERE CALCULATED FOR THE 2 MEASURES (SELF-EFFICACY AND TIME SPENT IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY) OVER THE INTERVENTION PERIOD. RESULTS: QUALITATIVE FINDINGS FROM FOCUS GROUPS SUGGEST THAT IT IS ACCEPTABLE FOR PRENATAL YOGA TO BE INTEGRATED INTO GROUP PRENATAL CARE CLASSES AND WOMEN REPORTED INCREASED CONFIDENCE WITH PHYSICAL ACTIVITY DURING PREGNANCY. PARTICIPANTS DID NOT CONSIDER THE INTERVENTION TO FIT WITHIN THE TRADITIONAL DEFINITION OF EXERCISE. WOMEN REPORTED INCREASED AMOUNTS OF TIME SPENT IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FROM BASELINE TO THE END OF PREGNANCY, BUT THERE WERE NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN SELF-EFFICACY OVER TIME. DISCUSSION: THE INTEGRATION OF GENTLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY INTO THE GROUP PRENATAL CARE MODEL WARRANTS FURTHER ATTENTION FOR POTENTIAL BENEFITS WITH REGARD TO MATERNAL PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WELLNESS.	2019	
                                                                                                                     
12  211 20 A SOCIAL MEDIA-BASED MINDFUL YOGA PROGRAM FOR PREGNANT WOMEN IN TAIWAN. SOCIAL MEDIA, A COMMUNICATION TOOL, IS INCREASINGLY USED TO FACILITATE THE ENGAGEMENT OF EXPERTS (SUCH AS A HEALTH PROVIDER) AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS IN A WIDE RANGE OF PROGRAMS. HOWEVER, SOCIAL MEDIA REQUIRES STUDY TO ELUCIDATE ITS APPLICATIONS UNDER WOMEN HEALTH-RELATED CONDITIONS. THIS WORK DEVELOPS A SOCIAL MEDIA-BASED MINDFUL YOGA PROGRAM FOR PREGNANT WOMEN, AND DELIVERS MEDIA CONTENT BY WAYS OF FACEBOOK PLATFORM AND DVD. THE RESULTS OF PILOT TESTING REVEALED USERS' PREFERENCE OF USING FACEBOOK PLATFORM. DEVELOPING EXPERIENCE AND USES' RESPONSES CAN PROVIDE VALUABLE INFORMATION FOR FURTHER IMPLEMENT SOCIALMEDIA BASED INTERVENTIONS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
13 2384 28 YOGA - A LABORIOUS WAY TO WELL-BEING: PATIENTS' EXPERIENCES OF YOGA AS A TREATMENT FOR HYPERTENSION IN PRIMARY CARE. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO DESCRIBE PATIENTS' EXPERIENCE OF YOGA AS A TREATMENT FOR HYPERTENSION, AS WELL AS THEIR EXPERIENCE OF LIVING WITH HYPERTENSION. DESIGN: QUALITATIVE INTERVIEW STUDY METHOD AND MATERIALS: IN 2013-2014, IN SOUTHERN SWEDEN, PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION FROM THREE HEALTH CARE CENTRES WERE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL ON YOGA FOR HYPERTENSION. AFTER COMPLETION OF THE STUDY, EIGHT WOMEN AND FIVE MEN (AGED 35-79), WHO HAD PRACTICED THE YOGA INTERVENTION, WERE INTERVIEWED ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES. WE USED A SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW GUIDE ACCORDING TO KVALE. QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED BY SYSTEMATIC TEXT CONDENSATION INSPIRED BY MALTERUD. RESULTS: TWO MAIN THEMES EMERGED DURING THE ANALYSIS PROCESS: YOGA - A LABORIOUS WAY TO WELL-BEING AND HYPERTENSION - A SILENT DISEASE. THE POSITIVE EXPERIENCES OF DOING YOGA WERE DESCRIBED IN TERMS OF TRANQUILLITY AND INCREASED AGILITY. THE DRAWBACKS WERE MAINLY LINKED TO THE TIME REQUIRED TO PERFORM THE EXERCISES. LIVING WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND HAVING TO TAKE MEDICATION CAN IMPLY A STIGMA AND CAUSE CONCERNS FOR FUTURE CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS. MOST PATIENTS THAT WE INTERVIEWED EXPRESSED A WISH TO FIND ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO TREAT THEIR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. PARTICIPATING IN THE YOGA STUDY WAS SEEN AS A GOOD POSSIBILITY TO TRY SUCH AN ALTERNATIVE WAY. CONCLUSIONS: MANY PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION IN SWEDISH PRIMARY CARE SEEM TO BE INTERESTED IN TRYING ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS TO CONTROL BLOOD PRESSURE. THE PATIENTS IN OUR STUDY EXPERIENCED SEVERAL BENEFITS FROM DOING YOGA, BUT THEY ALSO POINTED OUT DIFFICULTIES IN IMPLEMENTING YOGA AS A REGULAR AND PERMANENT LIFESTYLE CHANGE.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
14 1588 29 MEDICAL YOGA: ANOTHER WAY OF BEING IN THE WORLD-A PHENOMENOLOGICAL STUDY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF PERSONS SUFFERING FROM STRESS-RELATED SYMPTOMS. THE PREVALENCE OF STRESS-RELATED ILLNESS HAS GROWN IN RECENT YEARS. MANY OF THESE PATIENTS SEEK HELP IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE. YOGA CAN REDUCE STRESS AND THUS COMPLEMENTS PHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPY IN MEDICAL PRACTICE. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, NO STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED PATIENTS' EXPERIENCES OF YOGA TREATMENT IN A PRIMARY HEALTH CARE SETTING OR, SPECIFICALLY, THE EXPERIENCES OF YOGA WHEN SUFFERING FROM STRESS-RELATED ILLNESS. THUS, THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE THE MEANING OF PARTICIPATING IN MEDICAL YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR STRESS-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSIS IN A PRIMARY HEALTH CARE SETTING. THIS STUDY HAS A DESCRIPTIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL DESIGN AND TOOK PLACE AT A PRIMARY HEALTH CARE CENTRE IN SWEDEN DURING 2011. FIVE WOMEN AND ONE MAN (43-51 YEARS) PARTICIPATED. THEY WERE RECRUITED FROM THE INTERVENTION GROUP (N=18) IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL, IN WHICH THEY HAD PARTICIPATED IN A MEDICAL YOGA GROUP IN ADDITION TO STANDARD CARE FOR 12 WEEKS. DATA WERE COLLECTED BY MEANS OF QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS, AND A PHENOMENOLOGICAL DATA ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED. THE ESSENTIAL MEANING OF THE MEDICAL YOGA EXPERIENCE WAS THAT THE MEDICAL YOGA WAS NOT AN ENDPOINT OF RECOVERY BUT THE START OF A PROCESS TOWARDS AN INCREASED SENSE OF WHOLENESS. IT WAS DESCRIBED AS A WAY OF ALLEVIATING SUFFERING, AND IT PROVIDED THE PARTICIPANTS WITH A TOOL FOR DEALING WITH THEIR STRESS AND CURRENT SITUATION ON A PRACTICAL LEVEL. IT LED TO GREATER SELF-AWARENESS AND SELF-ESTEEM, WHICH IN TURN HAD AN IMPLICIT IMPACT ON THEIR LIFEWORLD. IN PHENOMENOLOGICAL TERMS, THIS CAN BE SUMMARIZED AS ANOTHER WAY OF BEING IN THE WORLD, ENCOMPASSING A PERCEPTION OF DEEPENED IDENTITY. FROM A PHILOSOPHICAL PERSPECTIVE, DUE TO USING THE BODY IN A NEW WAY (YOGA), THE PARTICIPANTS HAD LEARNT TO SEE THINGS DIFFERENTLY, WHICH ENRICHED AND RECAST THEIR PERCEPTION OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR LIVES.	2014	
                                                                                                                                 
15 2586 33 YOGA FOR HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS: A STUDY ON BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS OF ITS IMPLEMENTATION IN PRIMARY CARE. BACKGROUND: INTERNATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR HYPERTENSION TREATMENT RECOMMEND THE USE OF YOGA, PARTICULARLY AMONG LOW-RISK PATIENTS. HOWEVER, EVIDENCE IS LACKING ON THE IMPLEMENTATION POTENTIAL OF HEALTH-WORKER-LED YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN LOW-RESOURCE, PRIMARY CARE SETTINGS. OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS BARRIERS TO AND FACILITATORS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS IN PRIMARY CARE IN NEPAL. METHODS: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED USING FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS, IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS, KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS, AND TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS. DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM THE 'YOGA AND HYPERTENSION' (YOH) TRIAL PARTICIPANTS, YOH INTERVENTION IMPLEMENTERS, AND OFFICIALS FROM THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND POPULATION IN NEPAL. RESULTS: MOST YOH TRIAL PARTICIPANTS STATED THAT: (1) IT WAS EASY TO LEARN YOGA DURING A FIVE-DAY TRAINING PERIOD AND PRACTISE IT FOR THREE MONTHS AT HOME; (2) PRACTISING YOGA IMPROVED THEIR HEALTH; AND (3) GROUP YOGA SESSIONS IN A COMMUNITY CENTRE WOULD HELP THEM PRACTISE YOGA MORE REGULARLY. MOST YOH INTERVENTION IMPLEMENTERS STATED THAT: (1) THEY WERE HIGHLY MOTIVATED TO IMPLEMENT THE INTERVENTION; (2) THE COST OF IMPLEMENTATION WAS ACCEPTABLE; (3) THEY DID NOT NEED ADDITIONAL STAFF TO EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT THE INTERVENTION; (4) PROVIDING REMUNERATION TO THE STAFF INVOLVED IN THE INTERVENTION WOULD INCREASE THEIR MOTIVATION; AND (5) THE YOGA PROGRAMME WAS 'SIMPLE AND EASY TO FOLLOW' AND 'EASILY PERFORMED BY PARTICIPANTS OF ANY AGE'. THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS STATED THAT: (1) YOGA IS CONSIDERED AS A KEY HEALTH PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY IN NEPAL; AND (2) THE INTEGRATION OF THE YOGA INTERVENTION INTO THE EXISTING HEALTH CARE PROGRAMME WOULD NOT BE TOO CHALLENGING, BECAUSE THE EXISTING PERSONNEL AND OTHER RESOURCES CAN BE UTILISED. CONCLUSION: WHILE THERE IS A GOOD POTENTIAL THAT A YOGA INTERVENTION CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN PRIMARY CARE, CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT FOR HEALTH WORKERS AND THE INVOLVEMENT OF COMMUNITY YOGA CENTRES IN THE DELIVERY OF THE INTERVENTIONS MAY BE REQUIRED TO FACILITATE THIS IMPLEMENTATION.	2021	

16 2495 25 YOGA AS PALLIATION IN WOMEN WITH ADVANCED CANCER: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE PALLIATIVE POTENTIAL OF HOME-BASED YOGA SESSIONS PROVIDED TO WOMEN WITH ADVANCED CANCER. METHOD: PERSONALISED 45-MINUTE YOGA SESSIONS WERE OFFERED TO THREE WOMEN WITH ADVANCED CANCER BY AN EXPERIENCED YOGA TEACHER. EACH WOMAN TOOK PART IN A ONE-TO-ONE INTERVIEW AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE YOGA PROGRAMME AND WAS ASKED TO DESCRIBE HER EXPERIENCES OF THE PROGRAMME'S IMPACT. RESULTS: THE PERSONALISED NATURE OF THE YOGA SESSIONS RESULTED IN SIMILAR POSITIVE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL EFFECTS COMPARABLE TO THOSE DEMONSTRATED IN OTHER STUDIES WITH CANCER PATIENTS. PARTICIPANTS DESCRIBED PHYSICAL, MENTAL, AND EMOTIONAL BENEFITS AS WELL AS THE ALLEVIATION OF ILLNESS IMPACTS. THE ENHANCEMENT OF MIND-BODY AND BODY-SPIRIT CONNECTIONS WERE ALSO NOTED. CONCLUSION: PERSONALISED HOME-BASED YOGA PROGRAMMES FOR PEOPLE WITH ADVANCED CANCER MAY PRODUCE SIMILAR BENEFITS, INCLUDING PALLIATION, AS THOSE INSTITUTIONALLY-BASED PROGRAMMES FOR PEOPLE WITH NON-ADVANCED CANCER.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
17    6 33 "I JUST START CRYING FOR NO REASON": THE EXPERIENCE OF STRESS AND DEPRESSION IN PREGNANT, URBAN, AFRICAN-AMERICAN ADOLESCENTS AND THEIR PERCEPTION OF YOGA AS A MANAGEMENT STRATEGY. PURPOSE: PERINATAL HEALTH DISPARITIES ARE OF PARTICULAR CONCERN WITH PREGNANT, URBAN, AFRICAN-AMERICAN (AA) ADOLESCENTS, WHO HAVE HIGH RATES OF STRESS AND DEPRESSION DURING PREGNANCY, HIGHER RATES OF ADVERSE PREGNANCY AND NEONATAL OUTCOMES, AND MANY BARRIERS TO EFFECTIVE TREATMENT. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE PREGNANT, URBAN, AA TEENAGERS' EXPERIENCE OF STRESS AND DEPRESSION AND EXAMINE THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF ADJUNCTIVE NONPHARMACOLOGIC MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES, SUCH AS YOGA. METHODS: THIS COMMUNITY-BASED, QUALITATIVE STUDY USED NONTHERAPEUTIC FOCUS GROUPS TO ALLOW FOR EXPLORATION OF ATTITUDES, CONCERNS, BELIEFS, AND VALUES REGARDING STRESS AND DEPRESSION IN PREGNANCY AND NONPHARMACOLOGIC MANAGEMENT APPROACHES, SUCH AS MIND-BODY THERAPIES AND OTHER PRENATAL ACTIVITIES. FINDINGS: THE SAMPLE CONSISTED OF PREGNANT, AA, LOW-INCOME ADOLESCENTS (N=17) WHO RESIDED IN A LARGE URBAN AREA IN THE UNITED STATES. THE THEMES THAT AROSE IN THE FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS WERE THAT 1) STRESS AND DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS ARE PERVASIVE IN DAILY LIFE, 2) PARTICIPANTS FELT A GENERALIZED SENSE OF ISOLATION, 3) STRESS/DEPRESSION MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES SHOULD BE GROUP BASED, INTERACTIVE, AND FOCUSED ON THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF TEENAGERS, AND 4) YOGA IS AN APPEALING STRESS MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUE TO THIS POPULATION. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT PREGNANT, URBAN, ADOLESCENTS ARE HIGHLY STRESSED; THEY INTERPRET DEPRESSION-LIKE SYMPTOMS TO BE SIGNS OF STRESS; THEY DESIRE GROUP-BASED, INTERACTIVE ACTIVITIES; AND THEY ARE INTERESTED IN YOGA CLASSES FOR STRESS/DEPRESSION MANAGEMENT AND RELATIONSHIP BUILDING. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND RESEARCHERS FOCUS ON THESE NEEDS, PARTICULARLY WHEN DESIGNING PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION STRATEGIES.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
18  380 32 BECOMING CONNECTED: THE LIVED EXPERIENCE OF YOGA PARTICIPATION AFTER STROKE. PURPOSE: TO INVESTIGATE THE PERSONAL EXPERIENCES AND PERCEIVED OUTCOMES OF A YOGA PROGRAMME FOR STROKE SURVIVORS. METHOD: THIS ARTICLE REPORTS ON A PRELIMINARY STUDY USING QUALITATIVE METHODS TO INVESTIGATE THE PERSONAL EXPERIENCES AND PERCEIVED OUTCOMES OF A YOGA PROGRAMME. NINE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD EXPERIENCED STROKE WERE INTERVIEWED FOLLOWING A 10-WEEK YOGA PROGRAMME INVOLVING MOVEMENT, BREATHING AND MEDITATION PRACTICES. AN INTERPRETATIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL APPROACH WAS USED TO DETERMINE MEANINGS ATTACHED TO YOGA PARTICIPATION AS WELL AS PERCEPTIONS OF OUTCOMES. RESULTS: INTERPRETATIVE THEMES EVOLVING FROM THE DATA WERE ORGANISED AROUND A BIO-PSYCHOSOCIAL MODEL OF HEALTH BENEFITS FROM YOGA. EMERGENT THEMES FROM THE ANALYSIS INCLUDED: GREATER SENSATION; FEELING CALMER AND BECOMING CONNECTED. THESE THEMES RESPECTIVELY REVEALED PERCEIVED PHYSICAL IMPROVEMENTS IN TERMS OF STRENGTH, RANGE OF MOVEMENT OR WALKING ABILITY, AN IMPROVED SENSE OF CALMNESS AND THE POSSIBILITY FOR RECONNECTING AND ACCEPTING A DIFFERENT BODY. CONCLUSION: THE STUDY HAS GENERATED ORIGINAL FINDINGS THAT SUGGEST THAT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD A STROKE YOGA PARTICIPATION CAN PROVIDE A NUMBER OF MEANINGFUL PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL BENEFITS AND SUPPORT THE RATIONALE FOR INCORPORATING YOGA AND MEDITATION-BASED PRACTICES INTO REHABILITATION PROGRAMMES.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
19 1333 25 HOT YOGA ESTABLISHMENTS IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES SERVING PREGNANT WOMEN: A PILOT STUDY ON THE HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF ITS PRACTICE AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. HOT YOGA ESTABLISHMENTS HAVE BEEN INCREASING IN POPULARITY IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES. STUDIOS MAY SUPPORT PARTICIPATION AMONG PREGNANT WOMEN THOUGH NO CLINICAL STUDIES CURRENTLY EXIST THAT EXAMINE PRENATAL HOT YOGA EFFECTS. THE PILOT STUDY DESCRIBED IN THIS ARTICLE AIMED TO ASSESS THE SPREAD OF PRENATAL HOT YOGA AND TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND PRACTICES OF THOSE WHO ENGAGE IN HOT YOGA WITHIN A LOCAL COMMUNITY. A THERMAL ENVIRONMENT METER WAS USED TO MEASURE AMBIENT AIR CONDITIONS DURING THREE 90-MINUTE HOT YOGA CLASSES. MOTHERS WHO PRACTICED PRENATAL HOT YOGA WERE MORE LIKELY THAN NON-HOT YOGA PRACTITIONERS TO HAVE SOMEONE ASIDE FROM AN OBSTETRICIAN/GYNECOLOGIST DISCUSS PRENATAL EXERCISE SAFETY WITH THEM. PRENATAL PUBLIC HEALTH EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS NEED TO BE REFINED. PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS AND OBSTETRICIANS/GYNECOLOGISTS NEED TO BE AWARE THAT THOSE WHO ENGAGE IN A HOT YOGA PRACTICE ARE MORE LIKELY TO TRUST SOMEONE OTHER THAN THEIR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER OR PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONAL REGARDING SAFETY OF THIS PRACTICE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
20 1349 26 IF WE OFFER, WILL THEY COME: PERCEPTIONS OF YOGA AMONG HISPANICS. OBJECTIVE: YOGA IS UNDERUTILIZED BY THE HISPANICS. THIS STUDY EXAMINED PERCEPTIONS OF BENEFITS AND BARRIERS TO YOGA AMONG HISPANIC ADULTS, TO PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT MAY INCREASE THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THIS PRACTICE. SETTING: PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED FROM A COMMUNITY CENTER SERVING LOW-INCOME HISPANICS. DESIGN: SELF-ADMINISTERED CROSS-SECTIONAL QUESTIONNAIRES ASSESSING BENEFITS AND BARRIERS TO YOGA WERE CONDUCTED IN SPANISH AND ENGLISH. FISHER'S EXACT TEST WAS USED TO EXAMINE PERCEPTIONS OF YOGA BY GENDER, AGE, AND PRIOR EXPERIENCE. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS (AGES 18-85, 65 % WOMEN, N = 121) REPORTED SEVERAL BENEFITS TO YOGA. HISPANIC WOMEN, INDIVIDUALS 65 Y OR OLDER, AND THOSE WITH PRIOR EXPERIENCE, PERCEIVED MORE BENEFITS. BARRIERS TO YOGA ALSO DIFFERED BY DEMOGRAPHICS. MEN REPORTED THAT TIME AND THE PERCEPTION THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO DO UNREALISTIC PRETZEL-LIKE POSES AS DETERRENTS TO YOGA PRACTICE; YOUNGER INDIVIDUALS PERCEIVED YOGA TO BE BORING, AND THOSE WITH NO EXPERIENCE PERCEIVED LACK OF FLEXIBILITY AND FEELING LIKE AN OUTSIDER IN CLASS, AS BARRIERS TO YOGA. THE MOST COMMON BARRIER, ACROSS SUBGROUPS, WAS THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA PRACTICE. THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS REPORTED BEING WILLING TO ATTEND YOGA CLASSES IF OFFERED AT A LOW COST. CONCLUSION: PERCEIVED BARRIERS RELATED TO YOGA REFLECT A LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT YOGA AND WHAT IT ENTAILS AND THE COST OF CLASSES. DESPITE THESE BARRIERS, HISPANIC ADULTS FROM A LOW-INCOME POPULATION SAID THEY WOULD BE WILLING TO ATTEND YOGA CLASSES IF OFFERED AT A LOW COST. UNDERSTANDING AND ADDRESSING THESE BARRIERS CAN HELP RESEARCHERS AND HEALTH PRACTITIONERS IMPROVE DIVERSITY IN YOGA CLASSES AND RESEARCH.	2021

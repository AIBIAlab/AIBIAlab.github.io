2 1011 34 EFFECTS OF NATUROPATHY AND YOGA INTERVENTION ON CD4 COUNT OF THE INDIVIDUALS RECEIVING ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY-REPORT FROM A HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS SANATORIUM, PUNE. BACKGROUND: HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) INFECTION IS ONE OF THE MOST DEBILITATING CONDITIONS WHICH HAVE AFFECTED NEARLY 32 MILLION PEOPLE ACROSS THE GLOBE. ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY (ART) IS THE STANDARD CARE GIVEN TO THE HIV POSITIVE INDIVIDUALS. BUT THE PATIENT ADHERENCE TO ART IS FOUND TO BE VERY LESS AS PER PREVIOUS STUDIES. COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE IS BECOMING A PILLAR IN THE REHABILITATIVE EFFORTS FOR MANY LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS. AIM: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF NATUROPATHY AND YOGA INTERVENTION ON CD4 COUNTS OF HIV PATIENTS. METHODS: NINETY-SIX PATIENTS PREDIAGNOSED AS HIV POSITIVE WERE ENROLLED AFTER OBTAINING WRITTEN CONSENT AND TREATED WITH NATUROPATHY AND YOGA INTERVENTIONS LIKE HYDROTHERAPY, DIET THERAPY, MUD THERAPY, COUNSELING, ETC., FOR VARIOUS DURATIONS AT NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NATUROPATHY SANATORIUM. THEY WERE GROUPED INTO FOUR GROUPS (G1: 1-7 DAYS, G2: 8-15 DAYS, G3: 16-30 DAYS, G4: >30 DAYS) BASED ON DURATION OF STAY. CD4 COUNT OF EACH INDIVIDUAL WAS RECORDED PRE- AND POST-STAY. RESULTS: ALL ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED USING R PACKAGE VERSION 3.01. DEPENDENT SAMPLE T-TESTS WERE CONDUCTED TO EXAMINE THE SIGNIFICANCE AT 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL. OF THE 96 PATIENTS, MALE PATIENTS CONSTITUTE 55.2% AND FEMALE PATIENTS 44.8% WITH MEAN AGE 34.74 RECEIVED 1-180 DAYS (MEAN 28.75, STANDARD DEVIATION: 14.16) TREATMENT. SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE CD4 COUNT WAS OBSERVED IN TWO OUT OF THE FOUR GROUPS (G2: P = 0.052, AND G4: P = 0.00038, RESPECTIVELY). CONCLUSION: AN INCREASING TREND IN THE CD4 COUNT WAS OBSERVED THAT WAS PROPORTIONAL TO THE LENGTH OF THE STAY OF PARTICIPANTS AT THE HIV SANATORIUM. THIS INDICATES THE POSSIBILITY OF LIFESTYLE CHANGES CAN BRING POSITIVE OUTCOMES IN PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS WHEN USED AS AN ADJUVANT WITH ART CARE. THE LACK OF CONTROL GROUP IS A MAJOR LIMITATION OF THIS STUDY. NO ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO STUDY THE SUBJECTIVE CHANGES IN THE QUALITY OF LIFE, VIRAL LOAD, ETC., HOWEVER, LARGER CONTROLLED STUDIES ARE WARRANTED FOR CONCLUSIVE RESULTS.	2015

4 1805 28 PREVALENCE OF TYPE 2 DIABETES AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS: A PILOT CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY IN TWO DISTRICTS IN INDIA. INTRODUCTION: DIABETES IS ONE OF THE MAJOR HEALTH DISEASES IN THE WORLD TODAY. THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES IS WELL-ESTABLISHED. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE PREVALENCE OF TYPE 2 DIABETES AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS IN TWO DISTRICTS OF INDIA (ONE EACH IN WEST AND SOUTH OF INDIA). METHODOLOGY: IN THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL FIELD STUDY, 155 YOGA PRACTITIONERS FROM PUNE AND 192 FROM ERNAKULAM DISTRICTS WERE ASSESSED USING THE DIABETES RISK TEST AND FASTING BLOOD SUGAR. THE DATA COLLECTED WERE ENTERED IN A STATISTICS SOFTWARE PACKAGE AND ANALYZED USING THE PEARSON'S CORRELATION ANALYSIS, T-TEST, UNIVARIATE ANOVA, AND LINEAR REGRESSION TO UNDERSTAND THE PREDICTORS OF RISK FOR DIABETES. RESULTS: THE OVERALL PREVALENCE OF DIABETES AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS IN CENTRAL PUNE WAS 3.6% (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI]: [0.01-0.04]). 18.9% OF PARTICIPANTS (95% CI: [0.16-0.19]) WERE DIAGNOSED TO BE "AT RISK" FOR DIABETES. IN ERNAKULAM, THE OVERALL PREVALENCE OF DIABETES AMONG PRACTITIONERS WAS 26% (95% CI: [0.05-0.06]) WITH 12% OF PRACTITIONERS (95% CI: [0.05-0.06]) DIAGNOSED TO BE "AT RISK" FOR DIABETES (PREDIABETIC). HIGHER AGE AND LESSER DURATION OF YOGA PRACTICE WERE SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS OF DIABETES. CONCLUSION: IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR EVERY PERSON ABOVE THE AGE OF 40 TO UNDERGO REGULAR HEALTH CHECK-UPS AND SCREENING FOR DIABETES AND INVOLVE ONESELF IN LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION PROGRAMS SUCH AS YOGA FOR SIGNIFICANTLY LONG DURATION OF TIME ON A DAILY BASIS, TO BETTER MANAGE DIABETES.	2015

VRT AND ART SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN GROUP A (P LESS THAN .05) AND GROUP B (P LESS THAN .001).	1989	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
6  864 34 EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICES ON PSYCHO-MOTOR ABILITIES AMONG INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED CHILDREN. THE CHILDREN WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES SHOW DISORDERS AT MOTOR DEVELOPMENT AND COORDINATION. HENCE, THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO SEE THE EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICES ON PSYCHO-MOTOR ABILITIES OF INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED CHILDREN. SEVENTY INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED CHILDREN WERE DIVIDED INTO EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND CONTROL GROUP. BOTH EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUP WERE ASSESSED ON THE FIRST DAY AND AFTER 12 WEEKS OF THE YOGA INTERVENTION FOR STATIC BALANCE, EYE HAND COORDINATION, AGILITY AND REACTION TIME. THE SUBJECTS OF EXPERIMENTAL GROUP THEN UNDERWENT A TRAINING OF YOGA PRACTICES, FOR 1 HR FOR A TOTAL PERIOD OF 12 WEEKS. THE RESULT OF WITHIN GROUP COMPARISON REVEALED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN STATIC BALANCE, EYE HAND COORDINATION, AGILITY, AND REACTION TIME (P< 0.001) IN SUBJECTS OF YOGA GROUP HOWEVER NO CHANGE WAS OBSERVED IN CONTROL GROUP. THE PRESENT STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT 12 WEEKS OF YOGA IS EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING PSYCHO-MOTOR ABILITIES OF INTELLECTUALLY DISABLED CHILDREN.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
7 1986 31 SPATIAL AND VERBAL MEMORY TEST SCORES FOLLOWING YOGA AND FINE ARTS CAMPS FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN. THE PERFORMANCE SCORES OF CHILDREN (AGED 11 TO 16 YEARS) IN VERBAL AND SPATIAL MEMORY TESTS WERE COMPARED FOR TWO GROUPS (N = 30, EACH), ONE ATTENDING A YOGA CAMP AND THE OTHER A FINE ARTS CAMP. BOTH GROUPS WERE ASSESSED ON THE MEMORY TASKS INITIALLY AND AFTER TEN DAYS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE INTERVENTIONS. A CONTROL GROUP (N = 30) WAS SIMILARLY STUDIED TO ASSESS THE TEST-RETEST EFFECT. AT THE FINAL ASSESSMENT THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OF 43% IN SPATIAL MEMORY SCORES (MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS, TUKEY TEST), WHILE THE FINE ARTS AND CONTROL GROUPS SHOWED NO CHANGE. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA PRACTICE, INCLUDING PHYSICAL POSTURES, YOGA BREATHING, MEDITATION AND GUIDED RELAXATION IMPROVED DELAYED RECALL OF SPATIAL INFORMATION.	2004

AIM: TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF SHORT TERM YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION IN THE MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES AND PRE-DIABETES, THROUGH A 'PILOT' COMMUNITY-BASED STUDY. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 1292 SUBJECTS WITH DIAGNOSED TYPE 2 DIABETES AND PRE-DIABETES WERE RECRUITED FROM DIFFERENT STATES OF INDIA VIZ., KARNATAKA, MAHARASHTRA, GUJARAT, RAJASTHAN, AND TAMILNADU PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY. YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION WAS INTRODUCED THROUGH 10-DAY NON-RESIDENTIAL CAMPS. BASELINE AND POST INTERVENTION ASSESSMENTS OF FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE (FPG) WERE MEASURED ON THE FIRST DAY AND TENTH DAY RESPECTIVELY. OF 1292 SUBJECTS, 896 BOTH PRE- AND POST- FPG READINGS WERE AVAILABLE. DATA ANALYSIS WAS DONE USING STATISTICAL PACKAGE FOR THE SOCIAL SCIENCES (SPSS), VERSION 16. RESULTS: MEAN BASELINE FPG LEVEL WAS 133.1 (+/-47.98) AND THE MEAN POST INTERVENTION FPG REDUCED TO 121.19 (+/-40.56). THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN FPG, P VALUE (<0.0001). CONCLUSION: THE RESULT SUGGESTS THAT A SHORT-TERM YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION EFFECTIVELY REDUCES FPG LEVELS IN TYPE 2 DIABETES PATIENTS AND PRE-DIABETES.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
9 2784 27 YOGA THERAPY AS AN ADJUNCT TO TRADITIONAL TOOTH BRUSHING TRAINING METHODS IN CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER. AIM: TO EVALUATE IF YOGA COULD BE AN ADJUNCT TO REGULAR TRAINING METHODS IN TRAINING BRUSHING SKILL TO CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (ASD). METHODS: SEVENTY-TWO CHILDREN WITH ASD AGED 7-15 YEARS WERE SELECTED AND DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS (N = 36). CHILDREN IN GROUP I RECEIVED VISUAL PEDAGOGY AND VIDEO MODELING AND CHILDREN IN GROUP II RECEIVED VISUAL PEDAGOGY AND VIDEO MODELING WITH YOGA. PLAQUE AND GINGIVAL INDICES (PI AND GI) WERE RECORDED AT BASELINE AND AT THE END OF FIRST, SECOND, THIRD, AND SIXTH MONTH. THE SCORES WERE SUMMARIZED AS MEAN AND STANDARD DEVIATION AND INTER-GROUP COMPARISON WAS DONE USING INDEPENDENT T-TEST. RESULTS: INTER-GROUP COMPARISON OF MEAN PLAQUE AND GINGIVAL INDICES SCORES WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AT SECOND MONTH (P = .039 FOR PI AND P = .009 FOR GI). THE SCORES WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EVEN AT THIRD MONTH (P = .001 FOR PI AND P = .002 FOR GI) AND SIXTH MONTH (P = .001 PI AND GI), WITH CHILDREN IN GROUP II DEMONSTRATING BETTER ORAL HYGIENE. CONCLUSION: YOGA TRAINING CAN BE USED AS AN ADJUNCT TO ENHANCE TOOTH BRUSHING LEARNING CAPABILITIES OF CHILDREN WITH ASD IN ADDITION TO VISUAL MODELING AND PEDAGOGY.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
10 1103 31 EFFECTS OF YOGA VERSUS HYDROTHERAPY TRAINING ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE AND EXERCISE CAPACITY IN PATIENTS WITH HEART FAILURE: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. AIMS: THE AIMS OF THIS STUDY WERE TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOGA AND HYDROTHERAPY TRAINING HAD AN EQUAL EFFECT ON THE HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH HEART FAILURE AND TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS ON EXERCISE CAPACITY, CLINICAL OUTCOMES, AND SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION BETWEEN AND WITHIN THE TWO GROUPS. METHODS: THE DESIGN WAS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED NON-INFERIORITY STUDY. A TOTAL OF 40 PATIENTS, 30% WOMEN (MEAN+/-SD AGE 64.9+/-8.9 YEARS) WITH HEART FAILURE WERE RANDOMIZED TO AN INTERVENTION OF 12 WEEKS, EITHER PERFORMING YOGA OR TRAINING WITH HYDROTHERAPY FOR 45-60 MINUTES TWICE A WEEK. EVALUATION AT BASELINE AND AFTER 12 WEEKS INCLUDED SELF-REPORTED HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, A SIX-MINUTE WALK TEST, A SIT-TO-STAND TEST, CLINICAL VARIABLES, AND SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. RESULTS: YOGA AND HYDROTHERAPY HAD AN EQUAL IMPACT ON QUALITY OF LIFE, EXERCISE CAPACITY, CLINICAL OUTCOMES, AND SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. WITHIN BOTH GROUPS, EXERCISE CAPACITY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED (HYDROTHERAPY P=0.02; YOGA P=0.008) AND SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY DECREASED (HYDROTHERAPY P=0.03; YOGA P=0.01). PATIENTS IN THE YOGA GROUP SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED THEIR HEALTH AS RATED BY EQ-VAS ( P=0.004) AND DISEASE-SPECIFIC QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE DOMAINS SYMPTOM FREQUENCY ( P=0.03), SELF-EFFICACY ( P=0.01), CLINICAL SUMMARY AS A COMBINED MEASURE OF SYMPTOMS AND SOCIAL FACTORS ( P=0.05), AND OVERALL SUMMARY SCORE ( P=0.04). SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION WERE DECREASED IN THIS GROUP ( P=0.005). IN THE HYDROTHERAPY GROUP, LOWER LIMB MUSCLE STRENGTH IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY ( P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: YOGA MAY BE AN ALTERNATIVE OR COMPLEMENTARY OPTION TO ESTABLISHED FORMS OF EXERCISE TRAINING SUCH AS HYDROTHERAPY FOR IMPROVEMENT IN HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE AND MAY DECREASE DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IN PATIENTS WITH HEART FAILURE.	2017

12   56 28 A COMPARATIVE STUDY ON THE EFFECTS OF VINTAGE NONPHARMACOLOGICAL TECHNIQUES IN REDUCING MYOPIA (BATES EYE EXERCISE THERAPY VS. TRATAKA YOGA KRIYA). BACKGROUND: HUMAN EYE CAPTURES LIGHT RAYS AS THEY COME AND FALL ON THE RETINA AND CONVERT THEM INTO AN IMAGE. HOWEVER, IN MYOPIA, LIGHT RAYS FALL IN FRONT OF RETINA, CAUSING BLURRING OF IMAGE. CORRECTION OF THIS IS GENERALLY DONE USING CORRECTING DEVICES SUCH AS CORRECTIVE GLASSES AND CONTACT LENSES. EXISTENCE OF SOME ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES IS ALSO NOTICED IN LITERATURE. AIM: TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF BATES EYE EXERCISES AND TRATAKA YOGA KRIYA ON MYOPIA. MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY: ETHICAL CLEARANCE WAS OBTAINED FROM THE INSTITUTION, AND INFORMED CONSENT WAS TAKEN FROM PARTICIPANTS. IN THIS RANDOMIZED COMPARATIVE STUDY, 24 PARTICIPANTS (48 EYES) WERE TAKEN BASED ON INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA AND WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: GROUP A AND GROUP B, WHERE BATES EYE EXERCISE THERAPY AND TRATAKA YOGA KRIYA WERE GIVEN, RESPECTIVELY, FOR 8 WEEKS. PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSESSED FOR THEIR REFRACTIVE ERRORS AND VISUAL ACUITY PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION. RESULTS: DATA WERE ANALYZED BY SPSS VERSION 20. RESULTS OBTAINED REVEALED THAT BOTH BATES EXERCISES AND TRATAKA YOGA KRIYA WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING REFRACTIVE ERRORS AND IN IMPROVING VISUAL ACUITY (P VALUE OF REFRACTIVE ERROR IN RIGHT EYE: 0.4250; LEFT EYE: 0.4596; P VALUE OF VISUAL ACUITY IN RIGHT EYE: 0.5691; LEFT EYE: 0.8952). CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY CONCLUDES THAT NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES SUCH AS EYE EXERCISES AND TRATAKA YOGA KRIYA ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT ON MYOPIA.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
13 1050 23 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON BRAIN WAVE COHERENCE IN EXECUTIVES. AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF SELF MANAGEMENT OF EXCESSIVE TENSION (SMET), A YOGA BASED STRESS MANAGEMENT PROGRAM ON BRAIN WAVE COHERENCE. BRAIN WAVE RECORDINGS WERE TAKEN WITH BRAIN MASTER 2 CHANNEL EEG (VERSION-2.0). THE SUBJECTS FOR THE STUDY WERE 72 CORPORATE EXECUTIVES, 48.75 +/- 3.86 YEARS OF MEAN AGE REFERRED FROM OIL AND NATURAL GAS CORPORATION LIMITED. EEG DATA WAS RECORDED ON THE FIRST AND SIXTH DAY OF 5 DAYS SMET PROGRAM. A COMPLETE STATISTICAL AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS SHOWED 19.31% INCREASE (P=0.03) IN DELTA, 5.04% INCREASE (P=0.65) IN THETA, 15.40% INCREASE (P=0.09) IN ALPHA, 1.67% DECREASE (P=0.54) IN BETA AND 18.68% INCREASE (P=0.07) IN GAMMA WAVE COHERENCE BETWEEN PRE AND POST INTERVENTION MEASUREMENTS. TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT PARTICIPATION IN A SMET PROGRAM WAS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENT IN EMOTIONAL STABILITY AND MAY HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR 'EXECUTIVE EFFICIENCY'. BECAUSE BEFORE AND AFTER DESIGNS LIMIT INFERENCES ABOUT INTERVENTION EFFECTS, FURTHER RESEARCH IS WARRANTED TO EXPLORE THE EFFECTS OF SMET PROGRAM FOR STRESS MANAGEMENT USING A LARGER, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
14 1885 37 REDUCING THE SYMPTOMATOLOGY OF PANIC DISORDER: THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA PROGRAM ALONE AND IN COMBINATION WITH COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY. INTRODUCTION: YOGA IS A HOLISTIC SYSTEM OF DIFFERENT MIND-BODY PRACTICES THAT CAN BE USED TO IMPROVE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH. IT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE PERCEIVED STRESS AND ANXIETY AS WELL AS IMPROVE MOOD AND QUALITY OF LIFE. RESEARCH DOCUMENTING THE THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS OF YOGA HAS GROWN PROGRESSIVELY FOR THE PAST DECADES AND NOW INCLUDES CONTROLLED TRIALS ON A VARIETY OF MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS SUCH AS DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND PANIC DISORDER. OBJECTIVES: THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM PANIC DISORDER. WE AIMED AT OBSERVING THE EFFICACY OF YOGA TECHNIQUES ON REDUCING THE SYMPTOMATOLOGY OF PANIC DISORDER (ANXIETY AND AGORAPHOBIA), COMPARED TO A COMBINED INTERVENTION OF YOGA AND PSYCHOTHERAPY. METHOD: TWENTY SUBJECTS PREVIOUSLY DIAGNOSED WITH PANIC DISORDER WERE SELECTED. SUBJECTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO BOTH EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS: GROUP 1 (G1-YOGA: 10 SUBJECTS) ATTENDED YOGA CLASSES AND GROUP 2 (G2-CBT + YOGA: 10 SUBJECTS) PARTICIPATED IN A COMBINED INTERVENTION OF YOGA PRACTICE FOLLOWED BY A COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT) SESSION. BOTH INTERVENTIONS OCCURRED WEEKLY FOR 100 MIN AND LASTED 2 MONTHS. SUBJECTS WERE EVALUATED TWO TIMES DURING THE STUDY: PRE-TEST AND POST-TEST. PSYCHOMETRIC TOOLS INCLUDED THE BECK ANXIETY INVENTORY (BAI), HAMILTON ANXIETY RATING SCALE (HAM-A), THE PANIC BELIEFS INVENTORY (PBI), AND BODY SENSATIONS QUESTIONNAIRE (BSQ). RESULTS: STATISTICAL ANALYSIS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN ANXIETY LEVELS ASSOCIATED WITH PANIC DISORDER (G1: BAI - P = 0.035, HAM-A - P = 0.000; G2: BAI - P = 0.002, HAM-A - P = 0.000), PANIC-RELATED BELIEFS (G1: PBI - P = 0.000; G2: PBI - P = 0.000) AND PANIC-RELATED BODY SENSATIONS (G1: BSQ - P = 0.000; G2: BSQ - P = 0.000) BOTH IN G1 AND G2. HOWEVER, THE COMBINATION OF YOGA AND CBT (G2) SHOWED EVEN FURTHER REDUCTIONS IN ALL OBSERVED PARAMETERS (MEAN VALUES). CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY OBSERVED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PANIC SYMPTOMATOLOGY FOLLOWING BOTH THE PRACTICE OF YOGA AND THE COMBINATION OF YOGA AND PSYCHOTHERAPY. WHILE CONTEMPLATIVE TECHNIQUES SUCH AS YOGA PROMOTE A GENERAL CHANGE IN DEALING WITH PRIVATE EVENTS, CBT TEACHES HOW TO MODIFY IRRATIONAL BELIEFS AND SPECIFIC COGNITIVE DISTORTIONS. THE RESULTS OBSERVED IN G2 MIGHT INDICATE THAT THE TECHNIQUES COMPLEMENTED EACH OTHER, INCREASING THE INTERVENTION EFFICACY. THESE FINDINGS ARE IN AGREEMENT WITH MANY INVESTIGATIONS FOUND IN THE LITERATURE WHICH OBSERVED IMPROVEMENTS IN DIFFERENT MENTAL HEALTH PARAMETERS AFTER THE PRACTICE OF CONTEMPLATIVE TECHNIQUES ALONE OR COMBINED TO PSYCHOTHERAPY. FUTURE RESEARCH JOINING PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL VARIABLES COULD HELP BETTER ELUCIDATE THE MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH MIND-BODY PRACTICES WORK TO IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH.	2014	

15  693 29 EFFECT OF CONTROLLED BREATHING EXERCISES ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL STATUS AND THE CARDIAC AUTONOMIC TONE: SUDARSHAN KRIYA AND PRANA-YOGA. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY WAS TO OBSERVE THE EFFECT OF CONTROLLED BREATHING EXERCISES INCLUDING SUDARSHAN KRIYA (SK) AND PRANA-YOGA (PY) ON THE PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL STATUS. METHODS: THE STUDY GROUP INCLUDED 60 HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS (M:30, F:30) IN THE AGE GROUP OF 18 TO 30 YEARS (21.3 +/- 3.2 YRS), RANDOMLY DIVIDED IN TO THREE GROUPS OF 20 SUBJECTS EACH--(1) THE SK GROUP (2) THE PY GROUP AND THE (3) CONTROL GROUP. THE PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL DATA WAS COLLECTED AT THE FOLLOWING FOUR TIME INTERVENTIONS: BASELINE, 6TH, 60TH AND THE 150TH DAY. PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT WAS DONE USING QUESTIONNAIRES AND FOR THE AUTONOMIC TONE QUANTIFICATION HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) ANALYSIS WAS DONE USING THE STANDARD LEAD II ELECTROCARDIOGRAM RECORDINGS. IN A POST-HOC ANALYSIS EACH GROUP WAS FURTHER SUB DIVIDED IN TO THE FOLLOWING TWO PATTERNS, BASED ON THE BASELINE VALUES OF NORMALIZED LOW FREQUENCY (LF) POWER (CUTOFF 64 MS2): (I) PATTERN A-SUBJECTS WITH LOW LEVEL LF POWER, AND (II) PATTERN B- SUBJECTS WITH HIGH LEVEL LF POWER. RESULTS: THE STRESS MANAGEMENT SKILLS HAVE SHOWN SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SK GROUP BUT NOT IN PY AND CONTROL GROUP. SUBJECTS OF SK, PY, AND CONTROL GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN LF VALUE AND LF:HF RATIO FOR PATTERN A AND SIGNIFICANT DECREASE FOR PATTERN B. PLOTTED LF VALUE FOR PATTERN A & B IN SK AND PY PRACTITIONERS SHOWED CONVERGENCE, COMING TO A MEAN VALUE OVER THE PERIOD OF 150 DAYS. THE LF:HF RATIO CURVE PLOTTED OVER TIME FOR PATTERN A & B SHOWED CONVERGENCE IN SK GROUP ONLY. NO SUCH CONVERGENCE IN LF VALUE & LF/HF RATIO FOR PATTERN A & B WAS SEEN IN CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: IN CONCLUSION, SUDARSHAN KRIYA POSITIVELY MODIFIES STRESS COPING BEHAVIOR AND INITIATES APPROPRIATE BALANCE IN CARDIAC AUTONOMIC TONE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
16  749 28 EFFECT OF SAHAJA YOGA PRACTICE ON SEIZURE CONTROL & EEG CHANGES IN PATIENTS OF EPILEPSY. THE EFFECT OF SAHAJA YOGA MEDITATION ON SEIZURE CONTROL AND ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHIC ALTERATIONS WAS ASSESSED IN 32 PATIENTS OF IDIOPATHIC EPILEPSY. THE SUBJECTS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO 3 GROUPS. GROUP I (N = 10) PRACTISED SAHAJA YOGA FOR 6 MONTHS, GROUP II (N = 10) PRACTISED EXERCISES MIMICKING SAHAJA YOGA FOR 6 MONTHS AND GROUP III (N = 12) SERVED AS THE EPILEPTIC CONTROL GROUP. GROUP I SUBJECTS REPORTED A 62 PER CENT DECREASE IN SEIZURE FREQUENCY AT 3 MONTHS AND A FURTHER DECREASE OF 86 PER CENT AT 6 MONTHS OF INTERVENTION. POWER SPECTRAL ANALYSIS OF EEG SHOWED A SHIFT IN FREQUENCY FROM 0-8 HZ TOWARDS 8-20 HZ. THE RATIOS OF EEG POWERS IN DELTA (D), THETA (T), ALPHA (A) AND BETA (B) BANDS I.E., A/D, A/D + T, A/T AND A + B/D + T WERE INCREASED. PER CENT D POWER DECREASED AND PER CENT A INCREASED.

17  492 36 COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR EVALUATION BASED ON PHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS AMONG YOUNG HEALTHY SUBJECTS WITH YOGA AS INTERVENTION. OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICE ON COGNITIVE SKILLS, AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM, AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY BY ANALYZING PHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS. METHODS: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON 30 NORMAL YOUNG HEALTHY ENGINEERING STUDENTS. THEY WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED INTO TWO GROUPS: YOGA GROUP AND CONTROL GROUP. THE YOGA GROUP PRACTICED YOGA ONE AND HALF HOUR PER DAY FOR SIX DAYS IN A WEEK, FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE MONTHS. RESULTS: THE YOGA PRACTISING GROUP SHOWED INCREASED ALPHA, BETA, AND DELTA EEG BAND POWERS AND SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THETA AND GAMMA BAND POWERS. THE INCREASED ALPHA AND BETA POWER CAN REPRESENT ENHANCED COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS SUCH AS MEMORY AND CONCENTRATION, AND THAT OF DELTA SIGNIFIES SYNCHRONIZATION OF BRAIN ACTIVITY. THE HEART RATE INDEX THETA/ALPHA DECREASED, NEURAL ACTIVITY BETA/THETA INCREASED, ATTENTION RESOURCE INDEX BETA/(ALPHA + THETA) INCREASED, EXECUTIVE LOAD INDEX (DELTA + THETA)/ALPHA DECREASED, AND THE RATIO (DELTA + THETA)/(ALPHA + BETA) DECREASED. THE YOGA PRACTICE GROUP SHOWED IMPROVEMENT IN HEART RATE VARIABILITY, INCREASED SDNN/RMSSD, AND REDUCTION IN LF/HF RATIO. CONCLUSION: YOGA PRACTISING GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN VARIOUS COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS, SUCH AS PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT, NEURAL ACTIVITY, ATTENTION, AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION. IT ALSO RESULTED IN INCREASE IN THE HEART RATE VARIABILITY, PARASYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM ACTIVITY, AND BALANCED AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM REACTIVITY.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
18 1279 33 GAUGING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MUSIC AND YOGA FOR REDUCING STRESS AMONG ENGINEERING STUDENTS: AN INVESTIGATION BASED ON GALVANIC SKIN RESPONSE. BACKGROUND: THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO EXAMINE THE INFLUENCE OF MUSIC AND YOGIC BREATHING FOR THE MANAGEMENT AND CONTROL OF STRESS. OBJECTIVE: TO DISCOVER THE MOST EFFECTIVE STIMULI TO HANDLE STRESS BY MEASURING THE EFFECT OF TYPES OF MUSICAL DRILLS AND YOGIC BREATHING ON ENGINEERING STUDENTS USING THE GALVANIC SKIN RESPONSE SENSOR METER (GSRSM). METHODS: THE PRESENT STUDY ATTEMPTS TO STUDY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MUSIC AND YOGA DRILLS FOR RELIEVING AND MANAGING STRESS. THE STUDY USED A STRATIFIED RANDOM SAMPLING METHOD SELECTING ENGINEERING STUDENTS FROM FOUR STREAMS. THE GSRSM WAS USED AS A TOOL TO RECORD THE RESPONSES AFTER 300 SECONDS FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL AND THE CONTROL GROUPS OF 200 STUDENTS EACH. EACH GROUP WAS COMPRISED OF 52 FEMALES (26%) AND 148 MALES (74%). RESULTS: THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP REPORTED REDUCTION IN MEAN VALUE IN GALVANIC SKIN RESPONSE (GSR) WHEN THEY UNDERWENT DEEP YOGIC BREATHING, LISTENED TO RELIGIOUS HYMNS AND LISTENED TO FLUTE MUSIC. CONCLUSION: ON THE BASIS OF THE RESULTS, THE RESEARCHERS SUGGEST THAT ALL THREE TECHNIQUES I.E PRACTICING YOGIC BREATHING, LISTENING TO RELIGIOUS HYMNS AND LISTENING TO FLUTE MUSIC WERE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE STRESS LEVEL OF ENGINEERING STUDENTS.

AT THE END OF ONE MONTH THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN TERMS OF AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CIRCLES CROSSED (P<0.001, WILCOXON PAIRED SIGNED RANKS TEST) FOR BOTH HANDS AND A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CIRCLES LEFT OUT FOR THE RIGHT HAND (P<0.05). THE CONTROL GROUP SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN NUMBER OF CIRCLES CROSSED FOR THE LEFT HAND ALONE (P<0.05) AT THE END OF A MONTH ATTRIBUTED TO RE-TEST. THE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT ONE MONTH OF YOGA IMPROVED REVERSAL ABILITY, EYE-HAND CO-ORDINATION, SPEED AND ACCURACY WHICH ARE NECESSARY FOR MIRROR STAR TRACING.	2006

1  448 153 CHANGES IN AUTONOMIC VARIABLES FOLLOWING TWO MEDITATIVE STATES DESCRIBED IN YOGA TEXTS. OBJECTIVES: IN ANCIENT YOGA TEXTS THERE ARE TWO MEDITATIVE STATES DESCRIBED. ONE IS DHARANA, WHICH REQUIRES FOCUSING, THE SECOND IS DHYANA, DURING WHICH THERE IS NO FOCUSING, BUT AN EXPANSIVE MENTAL STATE IS REACHED. WHILE AN EARLIER STUDY DID SHOW IMPROVED PERFORMANCE IN AN ATTENTION TASK AFTER DHARANA, THE AUTONOMIC CHANGES DURING THESE TWO STATES HAVE NOT BEEN STUDIED. METHODS: AUTONOMIC AND RESPIRATORY VARIABLES WERE ASSESSED IN 30 HEALTHY MALE VOLUNTEERS (GROUP MEAN AGE +/- SD, 29.1 +/- 5.1 YEARS) DURING FOUR MENTAL STATES DESCRIBED IN TRADITIONAL YOGA TEXTS. THESE FOUR MENTAL STATES ARE RANDOM THINKING (CANCALATA), NONMEDITATIVE FOCUSING (EKAGRATA), MEDITATIVE FOCUSING (DHARANA), AND EFFORTLESS MEDITATION (DHYANA). ASSESSMENTS WERE MADE BEFORE (5 MINUTES), DURING (20 MINUTES), AND AFTER (5 MINUTES), EACH OF THE FOUR STATES, ON FOUR SEPARATE DAYS. RESULTS: DURING DHYANA THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE SKIN RESISTANCE LEVEL (P<0.001; POST HOC ANALYSIS FOLLOWING ANOVA, DURING COMPARED TO PRE) AND PHOTO-PLETHYSMOGRAM AMPLITUDE (P<0.05), WHEREAS THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE HEART RATE (P<0.001) AND BREATH RATE (P<0.001). THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE LOW FREQUENCY (LF) POWER (P<0.001) AND INCREASE IN THE HIGH FREQUENCY (HF) POWER (P<0.001) IN THE FREQUENCY DOMAIN ANALYSIS OF THE HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) SPECTRUM, ON WHICH HF POWER IS ASSOCIATED WITH PARASYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY. THERE WAS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NN50 COUNT (THE NUMBER OF INTERVAL DIFFERENCES OF SUCCESSIVE NN INTERVALS GREATER THAN 50 MS; P<0.001) AND THE PNN50 (THE PROPORTION DERIVED BY DIVIDING NN50 BY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF NN INTERVALS; P<0.001) IN TIME DOMAIN ANALYSIS OF HRV, BOTH INDICATIVE OF PARASYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY. CONCLUSIONS: MAXIMUM CHANGES WERE SEEN IN AUTONOMIC VARIABLES AND BREATH RATE DURING THE STATE OF EFFORTLESS MEDITATION (DHYANA). THE CHANGES WERE ALL SUGGESTIVE OF REDUCED SYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY AND/OR INCREASED VAGAL MODULATION. DURING DHARANA THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN SKIN RESISTANCE. THE CHANGES IN HRV DURING EKAGRATA AND CANCALATA WERE INCONCLUSIVE.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
2  915  32 EFFECTIVENESS OF RAJYOGA MEDITATION AS AN ADJUNCT TO FIRST-LINE TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS A SET OF MENTAL, PHYSICAL, AND SPIRITUAL PRACTICES WITH ITS ORIGIN IN ANCIENT INDIA. THE RENEWED INTEREST IN YOGA HAS LED TO THE EXPLORATION OF ITS BENEFITS IN A VARIETY OF PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS SUCH AS SCHIZOPHRENIA, DEPRESSION, AND ANXIETY DISORDERS. THERE IS A DEARTH OF LITERATURE ON THE EFFECT OF YOGA IN OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD) IN THE INDIAN CONTEXT. AIM: THE PRESENT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO FIND OUT THE EFFICACY OF RAJYOGA MEDITATION (RM) AS AN ADJUNCT TO THE FIRST-LINE TREATMENT IN THE TREATMENT OF OCD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PATIENTS WITH OCD (DIAGNOSED ACCORDING TO DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL OF MENTAL DISORDERS FIFTH EDITION) WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS - (I) THE MEDITATION GROUP (MG), WHICH INCLUDED 28 PATIENTS AND (II) THE NONMEDITATIVE GROUP (NMG), WHICH INCLUDED 22 PATIENTS. MG PRACTICED RM PROTOCOL FOR 3 MONTHS DURATION IN ADDITION TO THE PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT. THE NMG CONTINUED ON PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT AS USUAL. THE SYMPTOMATOLOGY WAS ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND 3 MONTHS USING THE YALE-BROWN OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE SCALE (Y-BOCS). RESULTS: AT 3 MONTHS, BOTH GROUPS DEMONSTRATED IMPROVEMENT IN SYMPTOMS. THE IMPROVEMENT IN MG WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT WITH A CHANGE OF 9.0 +/- 3.16 IN Y-BOCS AND A 49.76 +/- 9.52% REDUCTION IN SYMPTOMS. IMPROVEMENT SCORES OF NMG WERE ALSO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT WITH A CHANGE OF 3.13 +/- 2.59 IN Y-BOCS AND 18.09 +/- 14.69% REDUCTION IN SYMPTOMS. MG SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPROVEMENT IN Y-BOCS SCORES (49.76 +/- 9.52) AS COMPARED TO NMG (18.09 +/- 14.69) USING THE STUDENT'S PAIRED T-TEST (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: THE PRESENT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THE RM IS AN EFFECTIVE ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY TO REDUCE OBSESSIONS AND COMPULSIONS IN PATIENTS WITH OCD.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
3  739  31 EFFECT OF RAJA YOGA MEDITATION ON THE LIPID PROFILE OF POST-MENOPAUSAL WOMEN. BACKGROUND: CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE IS AN IMPORTANT CAUSE OF DEATH AND DISABILITY AMONG OLDER WOMEN. MODIFICATION IN LIPID PROFILE LOWERS THE RISK OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE. IT IS CLAIMED THAT YOGA AND TRANSCENDENTAL MEDITATION HAVE A CHOLESTEROL LOWERING EFFECT. THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF RAJA YOGA MEDITATION OF BRAHMAKUMARIS WHICH IS VERY SIMPLE TO PRACTICE, ON SERUM LIPIDS IN NORMAL INDIAN WOMEN. METHODS AND RESULTS: 49 NORMAL FEMALE VOLUNTEERS WERE THE SUBJECTS. THEY WERE DIVIDED INTO PRE-MENOPAUSAL (N=23) AND POST-MENOPAUSAL (N=26) GROUPS. THEY WERE FURTHER DIVIDED INTO NON-MEDITATORS (WHO HAD NEVER DONE ANY KIND OF MEDITATION), SHORT-TERM MEDITATORS (MEDITATING FOR 6 MONTHS TO 5 YEARS) AND LONG-TERM MEDITATORS (MEDITATING FOR MORE THAN 5 YEARS). LIPID PROFILE WAS ASSESSED USING THEIR RESPECTIVE REAGENT SETS. SERUM CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDE AND LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN-CHOLESTEROL IN NONMEDITATORS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IN POST-MENOPAUSAL WOMEN AS COMPARED TO PRE-MENOPAUSAL WOMEN. SERUM CHOLESTEROL AND LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN-CHOLESTEROL WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWERED IN BOTH SHORT AND LONG TERM MEDITATORS AS COMPARED TO NON-MEDITATORS IN POST-MENOPAUSAL WOMEN. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED IN LIPID PROFILE IN PRE-MENOPAUSAL WOMEN. CONCLUSION: RAJA YOGA MEDITATION LOWERED SERUM CHOLESTEROL AND LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN-CHOLESTEROL IN POST-MENOPAUSAL WOMEN THUS REDUCING THE RISK OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE IN THEM.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
4 1599  38 MEDITATIVE STATES BASED ON YOGA TEXTS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON PERFORMANCE OF A LETTER-CANCELLATION TASK. PERFORMANCE IN A SIX-LETTER CANCELLATION TASK WAS STUDIED IN 35 MALE EXPERIENCED MEDITATORS WITH EXPERIENCE RANGING FROM 6 TO 12 MONTHS. EACH PARTICIPANT WAS STUDIED IN FOUR SESSIONS, TWO MEDITATION AND TWO CONTROL SESSIONS. THE CONTROL SESSIONS WERE (I) CANCALATA OR NONTARGETED THINKING AND (II) EKAGRATA OR FOCUSING ON A SINGLE TOPIC, IN THIS CASE, MEDITATION. THE MEDITATION SESSIONS WERE (I) DHARANA OR FOCUSING ON THE SYMBOL "OM" AND (II) DHYANA OR AN EFFORTLESS SINGLE-THOUGHT (OF OM) STATE. EKAGRATA AND DHARANA DIFFER IN THAT THE FORMER INVOLVES FOCUSING WITH MULTIPLE THOUGHTS WHEREAS THE LATTER INVOLVES FOCUSING WITH A SINGLE THOUGHT, I.E., THE SIGNIFICANCE OF OM. THE NET SCORES ON THE SIX-LETTER CANCELLATION TASK WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AFTER A SESSION OF DHARANA AND LOWER AFTER THE CANCALATA SESSION, WHILE THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE AFTER EKAGRATA AND DHYANA SESSIONS. FOCUSING ON THE SYMBOL OM IN DHARANA MAY FAVORABLY INFLUENCE SELECTIVE ATTENTION, CONCENTRATION, VISUAL SCANNING ABILITIES, AND A REPETITIVE MOTOR RESPONSE COMPARED TO OTHER SESSIONS.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
5 1578  59 MEASUREMENT OF THE EFFECT OF ISHA YOGA ON CARDIAC AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM USING SHORT-TERM HEART RATE VARIABILITY. BACKGROUND: BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA HAVE BEEN POSTULATED TO BE DUE TO MODULATION OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM. OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF ISHA YOGA PRACTICES ON CARDIOVASCULAR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THROUGH SHORT-TERM HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV). DESIGN OF THE STUDY: SHORT-TERM HRV OF LONG-TERM REGULAR HEALTHY 14 (12 MALES AND 2 FEMALES) ISHA YOGA PRACTITIONERS WAS COMPARED WITH THAT OF AGE- AND GENDER-MATCHED 14 (12 MALES AND 2 FEMALES) NON-YOGA PRACTITIONERS. METHODS AND MATERIALS: ECG LEAD II AND RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS WERE RECORDED IN BOTH GROUPS USING POLYRITE DURING SUPINE REST FOR 5 MIN AND CONTROLLED DEEP BREATHING FOR 1 MINUTE. FREQUENCY DOMAIN ANALYSIS [RR INTERVAL IS THE MEAN OF DISTANCE BETWEEN SUBSEQUENT R WAVE PEAKS IN ECG], LOW FREQUENCY (LF) POWER, HIGH FREQUENCY (HF) POWER, LF NORMALIZED UNITS (NU), HF NU, LF/HF RATIO] AND TIME DOMAIN ANALYSIS [STANDARD DEVIATION OF NORMAL TO NORMAL INTERVAL (SDNN), SQUARE OF MEAN SQUARED DIFFERENCE OF SUCCESSIVE NORMAL TO NORMAL INTERVALS (RMSSD), NORMAL TO NORMAL INTERVALS WHICH ARE DIFFERING BY 50 MS (NN50), AND PERCENTAGE OF NN50 (PNN50)] OF HRV VARIABLES WERE ANALYZED FOR SUPINE REST. TIME DOMAIN ANALYSIS WAS RECORDED FOR DEEP BREATHING. RESULTS: RESULTS SHOWED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ISHA YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND CONTROLS IN BOTH FREQUENCY AND TIME DOMAIN ANALYSES OF HRV INDICES, WITH NO DIFFERENCE IN RESTING HEART RATE BETWEEN THE GROUPS. CONCLUSIONS: PRACTITIONERS OF ISHA YOGA SHOWED WELL-BALANCED BENEFICIAL ACTIVITY OF VAGAL EFFERENTS, AN OVERALL INCREASED HRV, AND SYMPATHOVAGAL BALANCE, COMPARED TO NON-YOGA PRACTITIONERS DURING SUPINE REST AND DEEP BREATHING.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
6 1173  35 EVALUATION OF A YOGA BASED REGIMEN FOR TREATMENT OF OSTEOARTHRITIS OF THE HANDS. OBJECTIVE: YOGA AND RELAXATION TECHNIQUES HAVE TRADITIONALLY BEEN USED BY NONMEDICAL PRACTITIONERS TO HELP ALLEVIATE MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COLLECT CONTROLLED OBSERVATIONS OF THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE HANDS OF PATIENTS WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA). METHODS: PATIENTS WITH OA OF THE HANDS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO RECEIVE EITHER THE YOGA PROGRAM OR NO THERAPY. YOGA TECHNIQUES WERE SUPERVISED BY ONE INSTRUCTOR ONCE/WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS. VARIABLES ASSESSED WERE PAIN, STRENGTH, MOTION, JOINT CIRCUMFERENCE, TENDERNESS, AND HAND FUNCTION USING THE STANFORD HAND ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRE. RESULTS: THE YOGA TREATED GROUP IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN THE CONTROL GROUP IN PAIN DURING ACTIVITY, TENDERNESS AND FINGER RANGE OF MOTION. OTHER TRENDS ALSO FAVORED THE YOGA PROGRAM. CONCLUSION: THIS YOGA DERIVED PROGRAM WAS EFFECTIVE IN PROVIDING RELIEF IN HAND OA. FURTHER STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO COMPARE THIS WITH OTHER TREATMENTS AND TO EXAMINE LONGTERM EFFECTS.	1994	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
7 1315  39 HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES WITH REGULAR YOGA AND HEARTFULNESS MEDITATION PRACTICE: RESULTS FROM A MULTINATIONAL, CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY. BACKGROUND: ALTHOUGH THE BENEFITS OF YOGA ARE WELL ESTABLISHED ACROSS THE WORLD, THERE ARE LIMITED STUDIES EXPLORING THE LONG-TERM INTERRELATION BETWEEN YOGA, MEDITATION, AND HEALTH. SPECIFICALLY, THERE IS LIMITED RESEARCH EXPLORING THE DIFFERENCES IN HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) AMONG REGULAR MEDITATORS AND NONMEDITATORS. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY EXPLORED THE DIFFERENCES IN 7 DOMAINS OF HRQOL (INCLUDING QUALITY OF LIFE, ABILITY TO ADOPT A HEALTHY LIFESTYLE, ABILITY TO RELAX, FREQUENCY OF NERVOUSNESS AND STRESS, COPING WITH DAY-TO-DAY STRESS, WORKPLACE PRODUCTIVITY, AND STAYING HEALTHY DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC) AMONG PRACTITIONERS OF YOGA AND MEDITATION. METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL, ONLINE SURVEY WAS DISTRIBUTED TO ALL MEMBERS WHO PARTICIPATED IN A 100-DAY YOGA AND MEDITATION PROGRAM, CULMINATING IN THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF YOGA EVENT, ORGANIZED BY THE HEARTFULNESS INSTITUTE IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE CENTRAL COUNCIL FOR RESEARCH IN YOGA AND NATUROPATHY, MINISTRY OF AYUSH, SVYASA YOGA UNIVERSITY, AND PATANJALI YOGA INSTITUTE, INDIA. THE PROGRAM CONSISTED OF DAILY VIRTUAL YOGA, MEDITATION, AND SPEAKER SESSIONS. THE DATA WERE ANALYZED BY NONPARAMETRIC MANN-WHITNEY U TEST AND KRUSKAL-WALLIS TESTS FOR CONTINUOUS VARIABLES AND CHI-SQUARE TEST FOR CATEGORICAL VARIABLES. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 3164 PARTICIPANTS FROM 39 COUNTRIES COMPLETED THE SURVEY. MEAN AGE WAS 33.8 (SD 13.6) YEARS. THE MAJORITY OF THE PARTICIPANTS WERE FEMALE (N=1643, 52%) AND STUDENTS (N=1312, 41.5%). REGULAR YOGA AND MEDITATION PRACTICE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A POSITIVE IMPACT ON ALL 7 DOMAINS OF HRQOL (MANN-WHITNEY P<.05 AND CHI(2)P<.05). NOTABLY, EXPERIENCED HEARTFULNESS (>/=2 YEARS) MEDITATORS REPORTED BETTER OUTCOMES IN ALL THE DOMAINS OF HRQOL AS COMPARED TO THOSE NOT CURRENTLY PRACTICING THIS FORM OF MEDITATION AND PARTICIPANTS WITH </=1 YEAR OF HEARTFULNESS MEDITATION EXPERIENCE (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDIES TO EXPLORE HRQOL OUTCOMES AMONG PARTICIPANTS OF A 100-DAY VIRTUAL YOGA AND MEDITATION PROGRAM. OVERALL, A YOGA AND MEDITATION PRACTICE WAS FOUND TO BE AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR PROMOTING HRQOL. REGULAR YOGA AND MEDITATION PRACTICE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH FACTORS PROMOTING HEALTH AND WELL-BEING, WITH LONG-TERM MEDITATION PRACTICE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED BENEFITS.	2022	

8  411  61 BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY DURING YOGA-BASED ALTERNATE NOSTRIL BREATHING PRACTICE AND BREATH AWARENESS. BACKGROUND: PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS SHOWN A REDUCTION IN BLOOD PRESSURE (BP) IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE PRACTICE OF ALTERNATE NOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING (ANYB) IN NORMAL HEALTHY MALE VOLUNTEERS AND IN HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS OF BOTH SEXES. THE BP DURING ANYB HAS NOT BEEN RECORDED. MATERIAL/METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE 26 MALE VOLUNTEERS (GROUP MEAN AGE +/-SD, 23.8+/-3.5 YEARS). WE ASSESSED (1) HEART RATE VARIABILITY, (2) NON-INVASIVE ARTERIAL BP, AND (3) RESPIRATION RATE, DURING (A) ANYB AND (B) BREATH AWARENESS (BAW) SESSIONS. EACH SESSION WAS 25 MINUTES. WE PERFORMED ASSESSMENTS AT 3 TIME POINTS: PRE (5 MINUTES), DURING (15 MINUTES; FOR ANYB OR BAW) AND POST (5 MINUTES). A NAIVE-TO-YOGA CONTROL GROUP (N=15 MALES, MEAN AGE +/-SD 26.1+/-4.0 YEARS) WERE ASSESSED WHILE SEATED QUIETLY FOR 25 MINUTES. RESULTS: DURING ANYB THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE (REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA) IN SYSTOLIC BP AND RESPIRATION RATE; WHILE RMSSD (THE SQUARE ROOT OF THE MEAN OF THE SUM OF SQUARES OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ADJACENT NN INTERVALS) AND NN50 (THE NUMBER OF INTERVAL DIFFERENCES OF SUCCESSIVE NORMAL TO NORMAL INTERVALS GREATER THAN 50 MS) SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED. DURING BAW RESPIRATION RATE DECREASED. IN CONTRAST, RESPIRATION RATE INCREASED DURING THE CONTROL STATE. ANYB AND BAW WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT (2-FACTOR ANOVA) IN RMSSD AND RESPIRATION RATE. BAW AND CONTROL WERE DIFFERENT WITH RESPECT TO RESPIRATION RATE. CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT VAGAL ACTIVITY INCREASED DURING AND AFTER ANYB, WHICH COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECREASE IN BP AND CHANGES IN THE HRV.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
9 1317  61 HEART RATE VARIABILITY CHANGES DURING HIGH FREQUENCY YOGA BREATHING AND BREATH AWARENESS. BACKGROUND: PRE AND POST COMPARISON AFTER ONE MINUTE OF HIGH FREQUENCY YOGA BREATHING (HFYB) SUGGESTED THAT THE HFYB MODIFIES THE AUTONOMIC STATUS BY INCREASING SYMPATHETIC MODULATION, BUT ITS EFFECT DURING THE PRACTICE WAS NOT ASSESSED. METHODS: THIRTY-EIGHT MALE VOLUNTEERS WITH GROUP AVERAGE AGE +/- S.D., 23.3 +/- 4.4 YEARS WERE EACH ASSESSED ON TWO SEPARATE DAYS IN TWO SESSIONS, (I) HFYB AND (II) BREATH AWARENESS. EACH SESSION WAS FOR 35 MINUTES, WITH 3 PERIODS, I.E., PRE (5 MINUTES), DURING HFYB OR BREATH AWARENESS (15 MINUTES) AND POST (5 MINUTES). RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN NN50, PNN50 AND THE MEAN RR INTERVAL DURING AND AFTER HFYB AND AFTER BREATH AWARENESS, COMPARED TO THE RESPECTIVE 'PRE' VALUES (P < 0.05) (REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA FOLLOWED BY POST-HOC ANALYSIS). THE LF POWER INCREASED AND HF POWER DECREASED DURING AND AFTER BREATH AWARENESS AND LF/HF RATIO INCREASED AFTER BREATH AWARENESS (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THERE WAS REDUCED PARASYMPATHETIC MODULATION DURING AND AFTER HFYB AND INCREASED SYMPATHETIC MODULATION WITH REDUCED PARASYMPATHETIC MODULATION DURING AND AFTER BREATH AWARENESS.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
10  297  50 ALTERNATE NOSTRIL BREATHING AT DIFFERENT RATES AND ITS INFLUENCE ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY IN NON PRACTITIONERS OF YOGA. INTRODUCTION: HEART RATE VARIABILITY IS A MEASURE OF MODULATION IN AUTONOMIC INPUT TO THE HEART AND IS ONE OF THE MARKERS OF AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS. THOUGH THERE ARE MANY STUDIES ON THE LONG TERM INFLUENCE OF BREATHING ON HRV (HEART RATE VARIABILITY) THERE ARE ONLY A FEW STUDIES ON THE IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF BREATHING ESPECIALLY ALTERNATE NOSTRIL BREATHING ON HRV. THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON THE IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF ALTERNATE NOSTRIL BREATHING AND THE INFLUENCE OF DIFFERENT BREATHING RATES ON HRV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE STUDY WAS DONE ON 25 SUBJECTS IN THE AGE GROUP OF 17-35 YEARS. ECG AND RESPIRATION WERE RECORDED BEFORE INTERVENTION AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SUBJECTS WERE ASKED TO PERFORM ALTERNATE NOSTRIL BREATHING FOR FIVE MINUTES. RESULTS: LOW FREQUENCY (LF) WHICH IS A MARKER OF SYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY INCREASED, HIGH FREQUENCY (HF) WHICH IS A MARKER OF PARASYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY DECREASED AND THEIR RATIO LF/HF WHICH IS A MARKER OF SYMPATHO/VAGAL BALANCE INCREASED IMMEDIATELY AFTER 6 AND 12 MINUTES IN COMPARISON TO BASELINE VALUES WHEREAS THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE MEANS OF THESE COMPONENTS WHEN BOTH 6 AND 12 MINUTES WERE COMPARED. CONCLUSION: IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF ALTERNATE NOSTRIL BREATHING ON HRV IN NON PRACTITIONERS OF YOGIC BREATHING ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE LONG TERM INFLUENCE OF YOGIC BREATHING ON HRV WHICH SHOW A PREDOMINANT PARASYMPATHETIC INFLUENCE ON THE HEART.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
11 1208  44 EXPLORATION OF LOWER FREQUENCY EEG DYNAMICS AND CORTICAL ALPHA ASYMMETRY IN LONG-TERM RAJYOGA MEDITATORS. BACKGROUND: RAJYOGA MEDITATION IS TAUGHT BY PRAJAPITA BRAHMAKUMARIS WORLD SPIRITUAL UNIVERSITY (BRAHMAKUMARIS) AND HAS BEEN FOLLOWED BY MORE THAN ONE MILLION FOLLOWERS ACROSS THE GLOBE. HOWEVER, RARE STUDIES WERE CONDUCTED ON PHYSIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF RAJYOGA MEDITATION USING ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY (EEG). BAND POWER AND CORTICAL ASYMMETRY WERE NOT STUDIED WITH RAJYOGA MEDITATORS. AIMS: THIS STUDY AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF REGULAR MEDITATION PRACTICE ON EEG BRAIN DYNAMICS IN LOW-FREQUENCY BANDS OF LONG-TERM RAJYOGA MEDITATORS. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: SUBJECTS WERE MATCHED FOR AGE IN BOTH GROUPS. LOWER FREQUENCY EEG BANDS WERE ANALYZED IN RESTING AND DURING MEDITATION. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TWENTY-ONE MALE LONG-TERM MEDITATORS (LTMS) AND SAME NUMBER OF CONTROLS WERE SELECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN STUDY AS PAR INCLUSION CRITERIA. SEMI HIGH-DENSITY EEG WAS RECORDED BEFORE AND DURING MEDITATION IN LTM GROUP AND RESTING IN CONTROL GROUP. THE MAIN OUTCOME OF THE STUDY WAS SPECTRAL POWER OF ALPHA AND THETA BANDS AND CORTICAL (HEMISPHERICAL) ASYMMETRY CALCULATED USING BAND POWER. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: ONE-WAY ANOVA WAS PERFORMED TO FIND THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EEG SPECTRAL PROPERTIES OF GROUPS. PEARSON'S CHI-SQUARE TEST WAS USED TO FIND DIFFERENCE AMONG DEMOGRAPHICS DATA. RESULTS: RESULTS REVEAL HIGH-BAND POWER IN ALPHA AND THETA SPECTRA IN MEDITATORS. CORTICAL ASYMMETRY CALCULATED THROUGH EEG POWER WAS ALSO FOUND TO BE HIGH IN FRONTAL AS WELL AS PARIETAL CHANNELS. HOWEVER, NO CORRELATION WAS SEEN BETWEEN THE EXPERIENCE OF MEDITATION (YEARS, HOURS) PRACTICE AND EEG INDICES. CONCLUSION: OVERALL FINDINGS INDICATE CONTRIBUTION OF SMALLER FREQUENCIES (ALPHA AND THETA) WHILE MAINTAINING MEDITATIVE EXPERIENCE. THIS SUGGESTS A POSITIVE IMPACT OF MEDITATION ON FRONTAL AND PARIETAL AREAS OF BRAIN, INVOLVED IN THE PROCESSES OF REGULATION OF SELECTIVE AND SUSTAINED ATTENTION AS WELL AS PROVIDE EVIDENCE ABOUT THEIR INVOLVEMENT IN EMOTION AND COGNITIVE PROCESSING.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
12 2796  23 YOGA THERAPY FOR OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD): A CASE SERIES FROM INDIA. YOGA IS AN ANCIENT SCIENCE WHICH HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE HELPFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SEVERAL PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS INCLUDING OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD). YOGA AS ADD-ON TREATMENT IN OCD MAY HELP ADDRESS ISSUES LIKE PARTIAL RESPONSE AND ADVERSE EFFECTS OF MEDICATIONS. HOWEVER, RESEARCH IN THIS AREA IS SPARSE, WHICH LED US TO EXPLORE IT THROUGH THIS CASE SERIES. IN THIS CASE SERIES WE HAVE DESCRIBED THE BENEFITS OF 1 MONTH OF YOGA AS ADD-ON TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH OCD. ALL PATIENTS WERE ON STABLE DOSES OF MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO AND DURING YOGA PRACTICE. PRE-POST ASSESSMENTS FOR THE CORE SYMPTOMS OF OBSESSION/COMPULSIONS AS WELL AS DEPRESSIVE AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS WERE DONE. THE ASSESSMENTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN Y-BOCS AND HAM-D SCORES AFTER 1 MONTH OF YOGA. YOGA THERAPY COULD BE AN EFFECTIVE ADD-ON THERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF OCD.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
13 1353  41 IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF SPECIFIC NOSTRIL MANIPULATING YOGA BREATHING PRACTICES ON AUTONOMIC AND RESPIRATORY VARIABLES. THE EFFECT OF RIGHT, LEFT, AND ALTERNATE NOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING (I.E., RNYB, LNYB, AND ANYB, RESPECTIVELY) WERE COMPARED WITH BREATH AWARENESS (BAW) AND NORMAL BREATHING (CTL). AUTONOMIC AND RESPIRATORY VARIABLES WERE STUDIED IN 21 MALE VOLUNTEERS WITH AGES BETWEEN 18 AND 45 YEARS AND EXPERIENCE IN THE YOGA BREATHING PRACTICES BETWEEN 3 AND 48 MONTHS. SUBJECTS WERE ASSESSED IN FIVE EXPERIMENTAL SESSIONS ON FIVE SEPARATE DAYS. THE SESSIONS WERE IN FIXED POSSIBLE SEQUENCES AND SUBJECTS WERE ASSIGNED TO A SEQUENCE RANDOMLY. EACH SESSION WAS FOR 40 MIN; 30 MIN FOR THE BREATHING PRACTICE, PRECEDED AND FOLLOWED BY 5 MIN OF QUIET SITTING. ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED HEART RATE VARIABILITY, SKIN CONDUCTANCE, FINGER PLETHYSMOGRAM AMPLITUDE, BREATH RATE, AND BLOOD PRESSURE. FOLLOWING RNYB THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SYSTOLIC, DIASTOLIC AND MEAN PRESSURE. IN CONTRAST, THE SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC PRESSURE DECREASED AFTER ANYB AND THE SYSTOLIC AND MEAN PRESSURE WERE LOWER AFTER LNYB. HENCE, UNILATERAL NOSTRIL YOGA BREATHING PRACTICES APPEAR TO INFLUENCE THE BLOOD PRESSURE IN DIFFERENT WAYS.

14  580  27 DESIGNING AND VALIDATION OF A YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION FOR OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER. SOME YOGA-BASED PRACTICES HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE USEFUL FOR PATIENTS WITH OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD). THE AUTHORS COULD NOT FIND A VALIDATED YOGA THERAPY MODULE AVAILABLE FOR OCD. THIS STUDY ATTEMPTED TO FORMULATE A GENERIC YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION MODULE FOR OCD. A YOGA MODULE WAS DESIGNED BASED ON TRADITIONAL AND CONTEMPORARY YOGA LITERATURE. THE MODULE WAS SENT TO 10 YOGA EXPERTS FOR CONTENT VALIDATION. THE EXPERTS RATED THE USEFULNESS OF THE PRACTICES ON A SCALE OF 1-5 (5 = EXTREMELY USEFUL). THE FINAL VERSION OF THE MODULE WAS PILOT-TESTED ON PATIENTS WITH OCD (N = 17) FOR BOTH FEASIBILITY AND EFFECT ON SYMPTOMS. EIGHTY-EIGHT PER CENT (22 OUT OF 25) OF THE ITEMS IN THE INITIAL MODULE WERE RETAINED, WITH MODIFICATIONS IN THE MODULE AS SUGGESTED BY THE EXPERTS ALONG WITH PATIENTS' INPUTS AND AUTHORS' EXPERIENCE. THE MODULE WAS FOUND TO BE FEASIBLE AND SHOWED AN IMPROVEMENT IN SYMPTOMS OF OCD ON TOTAL YALE-BROWN OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE SCALE (YBOCS) SCORE (P = 0.001). A GENERIC YOGA THERAPY MODULE FOR OCD WAS VALIDATED BY EXPERTS IN THE FIELD AND FOUND FEASIBLE TO PRACTICE IN PATIENTS. A DECREASE IN THE SYMPTOM SCORES WAS ALSO FOUND FOLLOWING YOGA PRACTICE OF 2 WEEKS. FURTHER CLINICAL VALIDATION IS WARRANTED TO CONFIRM EFFICACY.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
15   98  46 A NONRANDOMIZED NON-NAIVE COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF KAPALABHATI AND BREATH AWARENESS ON EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS IN TRAINED YOGA PRACTITIONERS. OBJECTIVES: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO COMPARE THE P300 EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS RECORDED BEFORE AND AFTER (1) HIGH-FREQUENCY YOGA BREATHING (HFYB) AND (2) BREATH AWARENESS. DESIGN: THE P300 WAS RECORDED IN PARTICIPANTS OF TWO GROUPS BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION SESSION (1 MINUTE IN DURATION). SETTINGS AND LOCATION: ALL PARTICIPANTS WERE RECEIVING YOGA TRAINING IN A RESIDENTIAL YOGA CENTER, SWAMI VIVEKANADA YOGA RESEARCH FOUNDATION IN BANGALORE, INDIA. SUBJECTS: THIRTY (30) MALE PARTICIPANTS FORMED TWO GROUPS (N = 15 EACH) WITH COMPARABLE AGES (WITHIN AN AGE RANGE OF 20-35 YEARS) AND COMPARABLE EXPERIENCE OF THE TWO TECHNIQUES, THE MINIMUM EXPERIENCE BEING 3 MONTHS. INTERVENTIONS: THE TWO GROUPS WERE EACH GIVEN A SEPARATE INTERVENTION. ONE GROUP PRACTICED A HFYB AT A FREQUENCY OF APPROXIMATELY 2.0 HZ, CALLED KAPALABHATI. THE OTHER GROUP PRACTICED BREATH AWARENESS DURING WHICH PARTICIPANTS WERE AWARE OF THEIR BREATH WHILE SEATED, RELAXED. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE P300 EVENT-RELATED POTENTIAL, WHICH IS GENERATED WHEN ATTENDING TO AND DISCRIMINATING BETWEEN AUDITORY STIMULI, WAS RECORDED BEFORE AND AFTER BOTH TECHNIQUES. RESULTS: THE P300 PEAK LATENCY DECREASED AFTER HFYB AND THE P300 PEAK AMPLITUDE INCREASED AFTER BREATH AWARENESS. CONCLUSIONS: BOTH PRACTICES (HFYB AND BREATH AWARENESS), THOUGH VERY DIFFERENT, INFLUENCED THE P300. HFYB REDUCED THE PEAK LATENCY, SUGGESTING A DECREASE IN TIME NEEDED FOR THIS TASK, WHICH REQUIRES SELECTIVE ATTENTION. BREATH AWARENESS INCREASED THE P300 PEAK AMPLITUDE, SUGGESTING AN INCREASE IN THE NEURAL RESOURCES AVAILABLE FOR THE TASK.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
16 1359  48 IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF OM CHANTING ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY MEASURES COMPARED BETWEEN EXPERIENCED AND INEXPERIENCED YOGA PRACTITIONERS. BACKGROUND: CHANTING "OM" IS A FORM OF MEDITATION THAT HAS NUMEROUS HEALTH BENEFITS. HOWEVER, THE NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS UNDERPINNING ITS EFFECT ARE SURPRISINGLY SCARCE. THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF OM CHANTING ON AUTONOMIC MODULATION, USING HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV), ON EXPERIENCED YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND YOGA NAIVE PERSONS. METHODS: THIS PROSPECTIVE STUDY INCLUDED 19 YOGA PRACTITIONERS (9 FEMALES AND 10 MALES; GROUP MEAN AGE +/- STANDARD DEVIATION [SD]; 25.9 +/- 3.2 YEARS) AND 17 YOGA NAIVE PERSONS (8 FEMALES AND 9 MALES; GROUP MEAN AGE +/- SD; 24.8 +/- 3.6 YEARS) OF BOTH SEXES AND SIMILAR AGE RANGE. BOTH THE GROUPS WERE ASSESSED FOR HRV INDICES (TIME AND FREQUENCY DOMAIN MEASURES) BEFORE AND AFTER LOUD OM CHANTING FOR 5 MIN. RESULTS: BASELINE COMPARISON USING MANN-WHITNEY U TEST BETWEEN GROUPS SHOWED YOGA PRACTITIONERS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED HIGH FREQUENCY (HF) POWER (P < 0.029) THAN NONYOGA PRACTITIONERS, SIGNIFYING A STATE OF TRANQUILITY BEFORE THE CHANTING OF OM. AFTER 5 MIN OF LOUD CHANTING OF OM, A COMPARISON BETWEEN GROUPS ASSESSED USING WILCOXON SIGNED RANKS TEST REVEALED: HF POWER, A COMPONENT OF THE PARASYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM, WAS FURTHER AMPLIFIED WITH A SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE (P < 0.001) IN THE YOGA PRACTITIONERS GROUP COMPARED TO NONYOGA PRACTITIONERS. FURTHERMORE, THIS INCREASE IN HF POWER WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN YOGA. CONCLUSION: THE PRESENT STUDY SHOWED THAT A BRIEF CHANTING OF OM (5 MIN) MIGHT ENHANCE PARASYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM ACTIVITY, PROMOTE RELAXATION, AND PROVIDE CALMNESS. FURTHER, THIS EXPERIENCE MAY BE ACHIEVED EFFECTIVELY IN INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCED IN YOGA THAN NONYOGA PRACTITIONERS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
17 1294  17 GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPING YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR RANDOMIZED TRIALS. LITTLE GUIDANCE IS AVAILABLE TO ASSIST RESEARCHERS IN DEVELOPING TREATMENT PROTOCOLS FOR RESEARCH ON YOGA FOR HEALTH CONCERNS. BECAUSE YOGA IS A COMPLEX MULTIFACTORIAL MIND-BODY DISCIPLINE HISTORICALLY DEVELOPED FOR NONMEDICAL PURPOSES, NUMEROUS DECISIONS MUST BE MADE IN ORDER TO THOUGHTFULLY DEVELOP SUCH PROTOCOLS. IN THIS PAPER, A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH IS PROPOSED TO ASSIST RESEARCHERS IN SELECTING AN INTERVENTION THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE CONDITION UNDER CONSIDERATION AND EXPLICITLY DEVELOPED. RESEARCHERS NEED TO CONSIDER THE TYPE OR "STYLE" OF YOGA, THE COMPONENTS TO INCLUDE (E.G., BREATHING EXERCISES, POSTURES) AS WELL AS THE SPECIFIC PROTOCOL FOR EACH COMPONENT, THE DOSE TO BE DELIVERED (FREQUENCY, DURATION OF PRACTICE, AND THE TOTAL DURATION OF PRACTICE), AND ISSUES RELATED TO SELECTION OF INSTRUCTORS AND MONITORING THE FIDELITY TO THE INTERVENTION. EACH OF THESE DOMAINS AND THE KEY ISSUES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROTOCOLS IS DISCUSSED. FINALLY, SOME AREAS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH RELATED TO PROTOCOL DEVELOPMENT ARE RECOMMENDED.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
18  752  41 EFFECT OF SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM BRAHMAKUMARIS RAJA YOGA MEDITATION ON PHYSIOLOGICAL VARIABLES. EFFECT OF SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM BRAHMAKUMARIS RAJA YOGA MEDITATION ON PHYSIOLOGICAL VARIABLES LIKE HEART RATE (HR), RESPIRATORY RATE (RR), SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (SBP) AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (DBP) WAS EVALUATED IN 100 SUBJECTS PRACTICING RAJA YOGA MEDITATION. ALL 100 SUBJECTS (33 MEN AND 67 WOMEN) WERE AGED 30 YEARS AND ABOVE (MEAN AGE 52.06 +/- 12.76 YEARS). SHORT-TERM MEDITATORS (STM) (N = 27) PRACTICED RAJA YOGA MEDITATION FOR DURATION OF SIX MONTHS TO FIVE YEARS (MEAN DURATION 3.37 +/- 1.67 YEARS) AND LONG-TERM MEDITATORS (LTM) (N = 73) PRACTICED RAJA YOGA MEDITATION FOR MORE THAN FIVE YEARS (MEAN DURATION 11.19 +/- 5.13 YEARS). THE PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO MEDITATE AND THE PHYSIOLOGICAL VARIABLES (HR, RR, SBP AND DBP) WERE RECORDED TWICE (15 MINUTES AND 30 MINUTES) AFTER BEGINNING OF MEDITATION. ALSO, THE FASTING BLOOD SUGAR WAS ESTIMATED BY GLUCOMETER. THE STUDY SUBJECTS DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY IN AGE AND VARIOUS ANTHROPOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS BODY WEIGHT, BODY MASS INDEX, WAIST-HIP RATIO AND FASTING BLOOD SUGAR. COMPARISON BETWEEN STM AND LTM SHOWED THAT THE CHANGES FROM BASELINE VALUES (FROM PREMEDITATION TO POST-MEDITATION AT 15 AND 30 MINUTES) IN LTM WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT WITH THOSE IN STM (P > 0.05). HOWEVER, WITHIN GROUP DIFFERENCES IN LTM REVEALED THAT CHANGES IN THE PHYSIOLOGICAL VARIABLES WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT WHEN COMPARED BETWEEN PRE AND POST MEDITATION BOTH AT 15 AND 30 MINUTES. THE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THE LONG-TERM PRACTICE OF RAJA YOGA MEDITATION IMPROVES BASIC CARDIO-RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS DUE TO SHIFTING OF THE AUTONOMIC BALANCE IN FAVOR OF PARASYMPATHETIC INSTEAD OF SYMPATHETIC SYSTEM.	2012

LONG SKY IS A COMBINATION OF PRANAYAMA AND CYCLIC RHYTHMIC BREATHING AND IS PERFORMED BY FOLLOWING THE GUIDED AUDIO INSTRUCTIONS. HRV ANALYSIS WAS USED FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF CARDIAC AUTONOMIC TONE. TIME AND FREQUENCY DOMAIN PARAMETERS OF HRV WERE CALCULATED BY USING RR INTERVAL OF ECG. SCL WAS ACQUIRED USING GALVANIC SKIN RESPONSE (GSR) AMPLIFIER OF POWERLAB IN MICROSEIMENS (MUS). RESULTS: TIME DOMAIN PARAMETERS OF HRV, INCLUDING MEAN RR INTERVAL (P = 0.000), RESPIRATORY SINUS ARRHYTHMIA (RSA) (P = 0.037), STANDARD DEVIATION OF ALL NN INTERVALS (SDNN) (P = 0.013), NN50 COUNT DIVIDED BY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ALL NN INTERVALS (PNN50) (P = 0.004), AND SQUARE ROOT OF THE MEAN OF THE SUM OF THE SQUARES OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ADJACENT NN INTERVALS (RMSSD) (P = 0.002) INCREASED, AND MEAN HEART RATE DECREASED (P = 0.000) FOLLOWING LONG SKY. IN FREQUENCY DOMAIN ANALYSIS, POWER OF LOW-FREQUENCY (LF) COMPONENT (P = 0.010) AND LF/HF RATIO (P = 0.008) DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY, WHEREAS POWER OF HIGH FREQUENCY (HF) SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED (P = 0.010). SCL DECREASED FOLLOWING LONG SKY, ALTHOUGH IT DID NOT ATTAIN STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT LONG SKY INDUCES SIGNIFICANT OSCILLATIONS IN CARDIAC AUTONOMIC TONE. PARASYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY INCREASES AND SYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY DECREASES AND SYMPATHOVAGAL BALANCE IMPROVES FOLLOWING LONG SKY. DECREASE IN SYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY IS ALSO DEMONSTRATED BY DECREASE IN CONDUCTANCE ALTHOUGH IT DID NOT REACH STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. FROM THIS STUDY IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT LONG SKY HAS A BENEFICIAL EFFECT ON CARDIAC AUTONOMIC TONE, AND PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL RELAXATION. IT MAY SERVE AS A TOOL TO IMPROVE HRV, WHICH IS THE MARKER OF CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                      
20  369  28 AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS IN RAJA-YOGA MEDITATORS. STRESS, AN INEVITABLE AND CONSTANT FEATURE THROUGHOUT THE LIFETIME, INDUCES AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTIONS, FOR WHICH MEDITATION IS CONSIDERED TO BE AN ANTIDOTE. SO THE CASE CONTROL STUDY WAS PLANNED INCLUDING 50 RAJA-YOGA MEDITATORS PRACTICING MEDITATION FOR 5 YEARS AND 50 AGE MATCHED NON-MEDITATORS. AUTONOMIC FUNCTION TESTS WERE PERFORMED AND RESULTS WERE COMPARED USING THE STUDENT-T TEST. MEAN VALUES OF RESTING HR, SBP AND DBP WERE LESS IN MEDITATORS. GALVANIC SKIN RESPONSE IN MEDITATORS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE (P < 0.001). MEAN INCREASE BP RESPONSE TO HAND GRIP TEST AND COLD PRESSOR TEST WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS IN MEDITATORS THAN NON-MEDITATORS (P < 0.001). STANDING: LYING RATIO, VALSALVA RATIO, INSPIRATION: EXPIRATION RATIO AND 30:15 RATIOS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN MEDITATORS THAN NON-MEDITATORS. FROM THE RESULTS, THERE WAS SHIFTING OF THE AUTONOMIC BALANCE TO PARASYMPATHETIC SIDE IN RAJA-YOGA MEDITATORS, WHICH SUGGESTS ITS UTILITY TO COMBAT THE ILL EFFECTS OF STRESS.	2015

1 1032 155 EFFECTS OF YOGA EXERCISES ON DIABETIC MELLITUS AS VALIDATED BY MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING. CONTEXT AND AIMS: EFFECTS OF PRACTICING YOGA IN DIABETIC MELLITUS (DM) PATIENTS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED TO IMPROVE IN CONTROL OF BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS WORK IS TO EVALUATE CHANGES IN BLOOD FLOW OF CALF MUSCLES AFTER SPECIFIC YOGA POSTURES FOR PATIENTS WITH DM USING MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) TECHNIQUES. TIME OF FLIGHT (TOF) MAGNETIC RESONANCE ANGIOGRAPHY MAXIMUM INTENSITY PROJECTION (MIP), T1 MAPS, T2 MAPS, AND DIFFUSION-WEIGHTED IMAGING ARE PERFORMED ON VOLUNTEERS AND DM PATIENTS BOTH PRE- AND POST-EXERCISE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TOF MIP, T1 MAPS WITH VARIABLE FLIP ANGLES, AND T2-WEIGHTED SPIN-ECHO IMAGING WERE PERFORMED ON FOUR VOLUNTEERS (AGED 30 +/- 5) AND DM PATIENTS (AGED 32-68) PREEXERCISE, ON A 1.5 T SIEMENS SCANNER. THE TOTAL ACQUISITION TIME WAS 6 MIN 20 S. EACH VOLUNTEER AND DM PATIENT WERE THEN REQUESTED TO PERFORM YOGA POSTURES SUPTA PADANGUSTHASANA, UTKATASANA, AND CALF RAISE FOR 6 MIN 30 S AT MAXIMUM EFFORT, OUTSIDE THE SCANNER, AND SUBSEQUENTLY RESCANNED. TO CALCULATE SIGNIFICANT SIGNAL INCREASE, REGION OF INTERESTS WAS DRAWN ON TOF MIP CORONAL IMAGES IN ARTERIES OF CALF MUSCLES. STUDENT T-TESTS WERE PERFORMED TO DETERMINE STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. RESULTS: AMONG VOLUNTEERS, A SIGNIFICANT SIGNAL INCREASE IN ARTERIES OF CALF MUSCLES WAS NOTICED, SIGNAL INTENSITY GRAPHS WERE PLOTTED. IN DM PATIENTS, SIGNAL INCREASE IN TOF MIP, T2-WEIGHTED IMAGES WERE SEEN IN SPECIFIC ARTERIES (POSTERIOR, ANTERIOR TIBIAL, AND POSTERIOR TIBIAL) OF CALF MUSCLES POSTEXERCISE. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: THE STUDY INDICATES THAT YOGA HAS A POSITIVE SHORT-TERM EFFECT ON MULTIPLE DM-RELATED FOOT COMPLICATIONS. THIS STUDY DEPICTS THAT MRI PROVIDES POTENTIAL INSIGHT INTO THE BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR DM PATIENTS THROUGH DERIVING BIOMARKERS FOR PREVENTIVE MEDICINE RELEVANT TO YOGA INTERCEPTION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
2  447  22 CHANGED PATTERN OF REGIONAL GLUCOSE METABOLISM DURING YOGA MEDITATIVE RELAXATION. USING POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY (PET), MEASUREMENTS OF THE REGIONAL CEREBRAL METABOLIC RATE OF GLUCOSE (RCMRGLC) ARE ABLE TO DELINEATE CEREBRAL METABOLIC RESPONSES TO EXTERNAL OR MENTAL STIMULATION. IN ORDER TO EXAMINE POSSIBLE CHANGES OF BRAIN METABOLISM DUE TO YOGA MEDITATION PET SCANS WERE PERFORMED IN 8 MEMBERS OF A YOGA MEDITATION GROUP DURING THE NORMAL CONTROL STATE (C) AND YOGA MEDITATIVE RELAXATION (YMR). WHEREAS THERE WERE INTRAINDIVIDUAL CHANGES OF THE TOTAL CMRGLC, THE ALTERATIONS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR INTERGROUP COMPARISON; SPECIFIC FOCAL CHANGES OR CHANGES IN THE INTERHEMISPHERIC DIFFERENCES IN METABOLISM WERE ALSO NOT SEEN; HOWEVER THE RATIOS OF FRONTAL VS. OCCIPITAL RCMRGLC WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ELEVATED (P LESS THAN 0.05) DURING YMR. THESE ALTERED RATIOS WERE CAUSED BY A SLIGHT INCREASE OF FRONTAL RCMRGLC AND A MORE PRONOUNCED REDUCTION IN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY VISUAL CENTERS. THESE DATA INDICATE A HOLISTIC BEHAVIOR OF THE BRAIN METABOLISM DURING THE TIME OF ALTERED STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS DURING YMR.	1990	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
3  371  24 AWARENESS AND PRACTICE OF AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA AMONG HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS IN ANAND CITY. BACKGROUND: AEROBIC EXERCISE IS HELPFUL IN REDUCING ELEVATED BLOOD PRESSURE (BP). IT WAS ALSO FOUND THAT YOGA IS USEFUL IN REDUCING RAISED BP. THUS, THEY BOTH CAN BE USED IN PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION. HENCE, THE STUDY AIMED TO OBSERVE BOTH AWARENESS AND PRACTICE OF AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA AMONG HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS IN ANAND CITY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL DESCRIPTIVE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED. A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS PREPARED CONTAINING 24 QUESTIONS ABOUT AWARENESS AND PRACTICE OF AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA AMONG HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS. THE QUESTIONS WERE EXPLAINED TO ALL THE PATIENTS, AND 200 PATIENTS WERE RECRUITED FROM ANAND CITY THROUGH CONVENIENCE SAMPLING. RESULTS: TWO-HUNDRED PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED IN THIS STUDY, OF WHICH 100% WERE AWARE OF HYPERTENSION. 67.68% WERE AWARE OF THE ROLE OF AEROBIC EXERCISE IN HYPERTENSION, OF WHICH 58.29% PRACTICED THEM. THE AWARENESS OF THE ROLE OF YOGA IN HYPERTENSION WAS NOTED IN 33.67% OF PATIENTS, OF WHICH ONLY 13.07% PRACTICED PRANAYAMA AND 9.50% PRACTICED ASANAS. CONCLUSION: THERE WAS A COMPLETE AWARENESS OF HYPERTENSION AMONG HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS. A LARGE NUMBER OF PATIENTS WERE AWARE OF THE ROLE OF AEROBIC EXERCISE IN HYPERTENSION, BUT ONLY FEW OF THE PATIENTS PRACTICED THEM. HOWEVER, THERE WAS LESS AWARENESS OF THE ROLE OF YOGA IN HYPERTENSION AND EVEN LESSER NUMBER PRACTICED THEM.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
4 2005  24 STUDY OF PULMONARY AND AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS OF ASTHMA PATIENTS AFTER YOGA TRAINING. "THE CONCEPT OF YOGA IS HELPFUL FOR THE TREATMENT OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA", HAS CREATED A GREAT INTEREST IN THE MEDICAL RESEARCH FIELD. IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS AND PULMONARY FUNCTIONS ARE IMPROVED IN ASTHMA PATIENTS AFTER SHORT TERM YOGA TRAINING, A STUDY WAS CONDUCTED WITH NINE DIAGNOSED BRONCHIAL ASTHMA PATIENTS. YOGA TRAINING WAS GIVEN FOR SEVEN DAYS IN A CAMP IN ADHYATMA SADHNA KENDRA, NEW DELHI. THE AUTONOMIC FUNCTION TESTS TO MEASURE THE PARASYMPATHETIC REACTIVITY (DEEP BREATHING TEST, VALSALVA MANOUEVER), SYMPATHETIC REACTIVITY (HAND GRIP TEST, COLD PRESSURE TEST), AND PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS FVC, FEV1, PEFR, PIF, BHT AND CE WERE RECORDED BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA TRAINING. THE RESTING HEART RATE AFTER YOGA TRAINING (P < 0.05) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED (89.55 +/- 18.46/MIN TO 76.22 +/- 16.44/MIN). THE SYMPATHETIC REACTIVITY WAS REDUCED FOLLOWING YOGA TRAINING AS INDICATED BY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.01) REDUCTION IN DBP AFTER HGT. THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN PARASYMPATHETIC REACTIVITY. THE FVC, FEV1, PEFR DID NOT SHOW ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. THE PIF (P < 0.01), BHT (P < 0.01) AND CE (P < 0.01) SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. THE RESULTS CLOSELY INDICATED THE REDUCTION IN SYMPATHETIC REACTIVITY AND IMPROVEMENT IN THE PULMONARY VENTILATION BY WAY OF RELAXATION OF VOLUNTARY INSPIRATORY AND EXPIRATORY MUSCLES. THE "COMPREHENSIVE YOGIC LIFE STYLE CHANGE PROGRAMME FOR PATIENTS OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA" HAVE SHOWN SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT EVEN WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD.	1996	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
5  509  40 COMPARATIVE IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT YOGA ASANAS ON HEART RATE AND BLOOD PRESSURE IN HEALTHY YOUNG VOLUNTEERS. INTRODUCTION: THIS STUDY PLANNED TO COMPARE IMMEDIATE CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT YOGA ASANAS IN HEALTHY YOUNG VOLUNTEERS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HEART RATE (HR), SYSTOLIC PRESSURE (SP), AND DIASTOLIC PRESSURE (DP), BLOOD PRESSURE (BP), WERE RECORDED USING THE NON INVASIVE BLOOD PRESSURE (NIBP) APPARATUS IN 22 HEALTHY YOUNG SUBJECTS, BEFORE AND AFTER THE PERFORMANCE OF DHANURASANA (DA), VAKRASANA (VA) (BOTH SIDES), JANUSIRASASANA (JSA) (BOTH SIDES), MATSYASANA AND SHAVASANA FOR 30 S. HR AND BP WERE FURTHER RECORDED DURING SUPINE RECOVERY AT 2, 4, 6, 8, AND 10 MIN. A REPEATED MEASURE OF ANOVA WAS USED FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. RESULTS: THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN HR AND BP BOTH IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ASANAS AS WELL AS DURING THE RECOVERY PERIOD. OVERALL COMPARISONS OF % CHANGES IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ASANAS REVEALED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WITH REGARD TO HR THAT INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER DA. IN THE RECOVERY PHASE, THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT INTERGROUP DIFFERENCES FROM 2 MIN ONWARD IN BOTH SP AND DP. THE DECREASE OF SP AFTER VA (RIGHT SIDE) (VA-R) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN SHAVASANA (4(TH), 6(TH), AND 8(TH) MIN) AND JSA (LEFT SIDE) (JSA-L) AT 6(TH) AND 8(TH) MIN. DP DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER PERFORMING JSA-L COMPARED TO VA-R AT THE 6(TH) AND 8(TH) MIN. DISCUSSION: THE CARDIOVASCULAR CHANGES IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ASANAS AND DURING THE RECOVERY PHASE REVEAL INHERENT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SELECTED POSTURES. THE RISE OF HR IN DA MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO INCREASED SYMPATHETIC RESPONSE DUE TO THE RELATIVE DIFFICULTY OF THE POSTURE AS WELL AS ABDOMINAL COMPRESSION OCCURRING IN IT. THE EFFECT OF SUPINE RELAXATION IS MORE PRONOUNCED AFTER THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ASANAS AS COMPARED TO MERE RELAXATION IN SHAVASANA. THIS MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO A NORMALIZATION AND RESULTANT HOMEOSTATIC EFFECT OCCURRING DUE TO A GREATER, HEALTHIER DE-ACTIVATION OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM OCCURRING TOWING TO THE PRESENCE OF PRIOR ACTIVATION. THERE WERE ALSO SUBTLE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RIGHT SIDED AND LEFT SIDED PERFORMANCE OF VA AND JSA THAT MAY BE OCCURRING DUE TO THE DIFFERENT INTERNAL STRUCTURES BEING EITHER COMPRESSED OR RELAXED ON EITHER SIDE. CONCLUSION: OUR STUDY PROVIDES INITIAL EVIDENCE OF DIFFERENTIAL CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS OF ASANAS AND SUBTLE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RIGHT AND LEFT SIDED PERFORMANCE. FURTHER, CARDIOVASCULAR RECOVERY IS GREATER AFTER THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ASANAS AS COMPARED TO SHAVASAN; THUS, IMPLYING A BETTER RESPONSE WHEN EFFORT PRECEDES RELAXATION.	2014	

6 2905  26 [LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF BREATHING EXERCISES AND YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA]. TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF BREATHING EXERCISES (BE) OR YOGA (Y) ON THE COURSE OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA WE STUDIED 36 SUBJECTS WITH A MILD DISEASE. THE PATIENTS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO 3 GROUPS. 2 OF THEM PARTICIPATED IN A 3 WEEKS TRAINING PROGRAM OF BE OR Y WHILE THE THIRD GROUP RESTED WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL TREATMENT (CONTROL GROUP, C). AT THE END OF THE TRAINING PERIOD THE PATIENTS WERE ASKED TO PRACTISE BE OR Y ON THEIR OWN. DRUG THERAPY AND LUNG FUNCTION PARAMETERS BEFORE AND AFTER A BETA 2-AGONIST METERED DOSE INHALER (ALBUTEROL, ALB) WERE RECORDED PRIOR TO THE TRAINING PROGRAM AND IN 4 WEEKS INTERVALS FOR 4 MONTHS THEREAFTER. THE RESPONSE TO THE BETA 2-AGONIST WAS DOCUMENTED CONTINUOUSLY IN 28 PATIENTS. THE MENTAL STATE OF THE PATIENTS WAS ELUCIDATED BY QUESTIONNAIRES.--PRIOR TO THE STUDY A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF INHALED ALB ON THE FEV1 WAS SHOWN WITHOUT ANY SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN GROUP DIFFERENCES. BOTH, BE AND Y, CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT AMELIORATION OF THE MENTAL STATE BUT ONLY THE BE INDUCED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OF LUNG FUNCTION PARAMETERS COMPARED TO THE INDIVIDUAL BASELINE VALUES.

7  850  27 EFFECT OF YOGA ON SHORT-TERM HEART RATE VARIABILITY MEASURE AS A STRESS INDEX IN SUBJUNIOR CYCLISTS: A PILOT STUDY. SUBJUNIOR ATHLETES EXPERIENCE MENTAL STRESS DUE TO PRESSURE FROM THE COACH, TEACHERS AND PARENTS FOR BETTER PERFORMANCE. STRESS, IF REMAINS FOR LONGER PERIOD AND NOT MANAGED APPROPRIATELY CAN LEADS TO NEGATIVE PHYSICAL, MENTAL AND COGNITIVE IMPACT ON CHILDREN. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF INTEGRATED YOGA MODULE ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) MEASURE AS A STRESS INDEX IN SUBJUNIOR CYCLISTS. FAST FURRIER TRANSFORM TECHNIQUE OF FREQUENCY DOMAIN METHOD WAS USED FOR THE ANALYSIS OF HRV. WE HAVE FOUND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN HIGH FREQUENCY (HF) COMPONENT BY 14.64% (P < 0.05) AND DECREASE IN THE LOW FREQUENCY COMPONENT (LF) OF HRV SPECTRUM BY 5.52% (P < 0.05) AND A DECREASE IN LF/HF RATIO BY 19.63% (P < 0.01) IN YOGA GROUP. IN THE CONTROL GROUP, THERE WAS DECREASE IN THE HF COMPONENT AND, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE LF COMPONENT OF HRV SPECTRUM AND LF/HF RATIO. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT YOGA PRACTICE DECREASES SYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY AND CAUSES A SHIFT IN THE AUTONOMIC BALANCE TOWARDS PARASYMPATHETIC DOMINANCE INDICATING A REDUCTION IN STRESS. IN CONCLUSION, YOGA PRACTICE HELPS TO REDUCE STRESS BY OPTIMIZING THE AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS. SO, IT IS SUGGESTED TO INCORPORATE YOGA MODULE AS A REGULAR FEATURE TO KEEP SUBJUNIOR ATHLETES BOTH MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY FIT.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
8   80  32 A MATHEMATICAL METHOD FOR ELECTROMYOGRAPHY ANALYSIS OF MUSCLE FUNCTIONS DURING YOGASANA. CONTEXT: FOR THE PAST FEW DECADES, THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE PRACTICING YOGA IS INCREASING IN NUMBER. YOGASANAS NEED SMOOTH BODY MOVEMENTS IN THE PROCESS OF ATTAINING DEFINED POSTURES THAT THE PERSON MUST HOLD ON TO ACTIVATE SPECIFIC MUSCLES OF THE BODY RELATED TO THAT ASANA. YOGASANAS SHOULD BE PERFORMED WITH PERFECTION TO DERIVE MAXIMUM BENEFITS. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INTRODUCE A MATHEMATICAL METHOD TO UNDERSTAND MUSCLE FUNCTIONALITIES WHILE DOING YOGASANAS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: USED DELSYS SURFACE ELECTROMYOGRAPHY (SEMG) - TRIGNO (DELSYS INC.) SENSORS FOR DATA RECORDING AND ANALYZING MUSCLE ACTIVATION PATTERNS. RESULTS: PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS WAS QUANTIFIED USING NORMALIZED SEMG SIGNALS. THE SEMG DATA DURING FINAL POSTURE WERE FIT TO A STRAIGHT LINE USING LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT THE SLOPE OF THE BEST FIT LINE IS A GOOD METRIC FOR MONITORING THE MUSCLE ACTIVITY DURING YOGA PERFORMANCE. THE ADVANTAGES OF THIS METHOD ARE THE SLOPE OF THE LINE IS A GOOD INDICATOR FOR MONITORING THE MUSCLE ACTIVITY WHILE DOING YOGASANA AND THE METHOD SUGGESTED IN THIS STUDY CAN BE EXTENDED FOR ANALYZING OTHER ASANAS AS WELL.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
9 2085  33 THE EFFECT OF LONG TERM COMBINED YOGA PRACTICE ON THE BASAL METABOLIC RATE OF HEALTHY ADULTS. BACKGROUND: DIFFERENT PROCEDURES PRACTICED IN YOGA HAVE STIMULATORY OR INHIBITORY EFFECTS ON THE BASAL METABOLIC RATE WHEN STUDIED ACUTELY. IN DAILY LIFE HOWEVER, THESE PROCEDURES ARE USUALLY PRACTICED IN COMBINATION. THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE NET CHANGE IN THE BASAL METABOLIC RATE (BMR) OF INDIVIDUALS ACTIVELY ENGAGING IN A COMBINATION OF YOGA PRACTICES (ASANA OR YOGIC POSTURES, MEDITATION AND PRANAYAMA OR BREATHING EXERCISES) FOR A MINIMUM PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS, AT A RESIDENTIAL YOGA EDUCATION AND RESEARCH CENTER AT BANGALORE. METHODS: THE MEASURED BMR OF INDIVIDUALS PRACTICING YOGA THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PRACTICES WAS COMPARED WITH THAT OF CONTROL SUBJECTS WHO DID NOT PRACTICE YOGA BUT LED SIMILAR LIFESTYLES. RESULTS: THE BMR OF THE YOGA PRACTITIONERS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THAT OF THE NON-YOGA GROUP, AND WAS LOWER BY ABOUT 13 % WHEN ADJUSTED FOR BODY WEIGHT (P < 0.001). THIS DIFFERENCE PERSISTED WHEN THE GROUPS WERE STRATIFIED BY GENDER; HOWEVER, THE DIFFERENCE IN BMR ADJUSTED FOR BODY WEIGHT WAS GREATER IN WOMEN THAN MEN (ABOUT 8 AND 18% RESPECTIVELY). IN ADDITION, THE MEAN BMR OF THE YOGA GROUP WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THEIR PREDICTED VALUES, WHILE THE MEAN BMR OF NON-YOGA GROUP WAS COMPARABLE WITH THEIR PREDICTED VALUES DERIVED FROM 1985 WHO/FAO/UNU PREDICTIVE EQUATIONS. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BMR, PROBABLY LINKED TO REDUCED AROUSAL, WITH THE LONG TERM PRACTICE OF YOGA USING A COMBINATION OF STIMULATORY AND INHIBITORY YOGIC PRACTICES.	2006	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
10 1301  32 HATHA YOGA ON BODY BALANCE. BACKGROUND: A GOOD BODY BALANCE REQUIRES A PROPER FUNCTION OF VESTIBULAR, VISUAL, AND SOMATOSENSORY SYSTEMS WHICH CAN BE REACH WITH EXERCISE PRACTICE AND/OR YOGA. AIM: TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF A 5-MONTH HATHA YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM ON BODY BALANCE IN YOUNG ADULTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS STUDY USED A CONTROLLED, NONRANDOMIZED DESIGN, WHERE THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP UNDERWENT A 5-MONTH TRAINING PROGRAM AND WERE THEN COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP THAT HAD A SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE. A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF 34 OUT OF 40 MEN AGED 25-55 YEARS OLD (34.0 +/- 0.9) WERE DEEMED ELIGIBLE FOR THIS STUDY. THEY WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUPS. SUBJECTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WERE ENGAGED IN 60 MIN SESSIONS OF HATHA YOGA THREE TIMES A WEEK FOR 5 MONTHS. WE EVALUATED POSTURAL CONTROL BY MEASURING THE LIMIT OF STABILITY AND VELOCITY OF OSCILLATION (VOS) IN THREE CONDITIONS OF THE BALANCE REHABILITATION UNIT (BRU) AND THROUGH FIELD PROCEDURES (FOUR POSITION, PLANE, FLAMINGO, HOPSCOTCH, AND DYNAMIC TEST). RESULTS: WE OBSERVED DIFFERENCES (P < 0.05) IN POSTINTERVENTION SCORES BETWEEN THE GROUPS REGARDLESS OF BRU PARAMETERS AND FIELD PROCEDURES (EXCEPT FOR FLAMINGO) EVEN AFTER ADJUSTING FOR PREINTERVENTION SCORES, SUGGESTING THAT THESE CHANGES WERE INDUCED BY HATHA YOGA TRAINING. THE PARTIAL ETA SQUARED ON BRU PARAMETERS RANGED FROM 0.78 (VOS1)-0.97 (COP2), AND FROM 0.00 (FLAMINGO)-0.94 (FOUR POSITION) FOR THE FIELD PROCEDURES. CONCLUSIONS: OUR RESULTS PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT POSTURAL CONTROL IN HEALTHY YOUNG ADULTS CAN BE IMPROVED THROUGH PRACTICING HATHA YOGA.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
11  887  15 EFFECT OF YOGA TYPE BREATHING ON HEART RATE AND CARDIAC AXIS OF NORMAL SUBJECTS. EFFECT OF INSPIRATORY AND EXPIRATORY PHASES OF NORMAL QUIET BREATHING, DEEP BREATHING AND SAVITRI PRANAYAM TYPE BREATHING ON HEART RATE AND MEAN VENTRICULAR QRS AXIS WAS INVESTIGATED IN YOUNG, HEALTHY UNTRAINED SUBJECTS. PRANAYAM TYPE BREATHING PRODUCED SIGNIFICANT CARDIOACCELERATION AND INCREASE IN QRS AXIS DURING THE INSPIRATORY PHASE AS COMPARED TO EUPNEA. ON THE OTHER HAND, EXPIRATORY EFFORT DURING PRANAYAM TYPE BREATHING DID NOT PRODUCE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN HEART RATE OR QRS AXIS. THE CHANGES IN HEART RATE AND QRS AXIS DURING THE INSPIRATORY AND EXPIRATORY PHASES OF PRANAYAM TYPE BREATHING WERE SIMILAR TO THE CHANGES OBSERVED DURING THE CORRESPONDING PHASES OF DEEP BREATHING.	1986	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
12  712  33 EFFECT OF INTEGRATED YOGA ON ANTI-PSYCHOTIC INDUCED SIDE EFFECTS AND COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM SCHIZOPHRENIA. BACKGROUND TWENTY ONE (12 FEMALES) SUBJECTS, DIAGNOSED WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA BY A PSYCHIATRIST USING ICD-10, IN THE AGES 52.87 + 9.5YEARS AND SUFFERING SINCE 24.0 +/- 3.05YEARS WERE RECRUITED INTO THE STUDY FROM A SCHIZOPHRENIA REHABILITATION CENTER IN BENGALURU. METHODS ALL SUBJECTS WERE TAKING ANTI-PSYCHOTIC MEDICATIONS AND WERE IN STABLE STATE FOR MORE THAN A MONTH. PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATIONS WERE KEPT CONSTANT DURING THE STUDY PERIOD. ASSESSMENTS WERE DONE AT THREE POINTS OF TIME: (1) BASELINE, (2) AFTER ONE MONTH OF USUAL ROUTINE (PRE) AND (3) AFTER FIVE MONTHS OF VALIDATED INTEGRATED YOGA (IY) INTERVENTION (POST). VALIDATED 1H YOGA MODULE (CONSISTING OF ASANAS, PRANAYAMA, RELAXATION TECHNIQUES AND CHANTINGS) WAS PRACTICED FOR 5MONTHS, FIVE SESSIONS PER WEEK. ANTIPSYCHOTIC-INDUCED SIDE EFFECTS WERE ASSESSED USING SIMPSON ANGUS SCALE (SAS) AND UDVALG FOR KLINISKE UNDERSOGELSER (UKU) SIDE EFFECT RATING SCALE. COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS (USING TRAIL MAKING TEST A AND B), CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND ANTHROPOMETRY WERE ASSESSED AS SECONDARY VARIABLES. COMPARISONS BETWEEN "PRE" AND "POST" DATA WAS DONE USING PAIRED SAMPLES T-TESTS AFTER SUBTRACTING BASELINE SCORES FROM THEM RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS AT THE END OF FIVE MONTHS, SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DRUG-INDUCED PARKINSONIAN SYMPTOMS (SAS SCORE; P=0.001) AND 38 ITEMS OF UKU SCALE WAS OBSERVED ALONG WITH SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PROCESSING SPEED, EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS AND NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA PATIENTS. NO SIDE EFFECTS OF YOGA WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS THE PRESENT STUDY PROVIDES PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE FOR USEFULNESS OF INTEGRATED YOGA INTERVENTION IN MANAGING ANTI-PSYCHOTIC-INDUCED SIDE EFFECTS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
13  295  33 AGE RELATED DIFFERENCES OF SELECTED HATHA YOGA PRACTICES ON ANTHROPOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS, MUSCULAR STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY OF HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS. BACKGROUND: PHYSIOLOGICAL BENEFITS OF YOGA ON VOLUNTEERS OF A PARTICULAR AGE GROUP ARE AVAILABLE. HOWEVER, REPORTS ON EFFICACY OF A SPECIFIC YOGA PACKAGE ON THE POPULACE OF DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS FROM SIMILAR OCCUPATIONAL BACKGROUND IS STILL VERY LIMITED. THEREFORE, THE PRESENT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO APPRAISE THE EFFECT OF A SPECIFIC HATHA YOGA PACKAGE ON ANTHROPOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS, FLEXIBILITY AND MUSCULAR STRENGTH OF HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS OF DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS FROM SIMILAR OCCUPATIONAL TRADE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 71 PARTICIPANTS (GROUP ALL) FROM INDIAN AIR FORCE GROUND PERSONNEL VOLUNTEERED AND AGE WISE DIVIDED INTO 3 GROUPS - (I) GROUP I (GR. - I) (N1 = 27, 20-29 YEARS), (II) GROUP II (GR. - II) (N2 = 21, 30-39 YEARS) AND (III) GROUP III (GR. - III) (N3 = 23, 40-49 YEARS). ALL THE PARTICIPANTS UNDERGONE SELECTED HATHA YOGA TRAINING FOR 1 H DAILY FOR A PERIOD OF 12 WEEKS. PARAMETERS WERE RECORDED BEFORE AND AFTER THE TRAINING. PRE AND POST TRAINING DIFFERENCES WERE ASSESSED BY STUDENT'S T-TEST. RESULTS: BODY WEIGHT (ALL, GR. - II AND GR. - III [ALL P < 0.05]), BODY MASS INDEX (GR. - II AND GR. - III [BOTH P < 0.01]) AND FAT% (GR. - II AND III [BOTH P < 0.05]) WERE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. NECK CIRCUMFERENCE WAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN GR. - I (P < 0.05) BUT DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN GR. - III (P < 0.05). CHEST CIRCUMFERENCE (ALL (P < 0.001), IN GR. - I AND II [BOTH P < 0.05]), GRIP STRENGTH (ALL [LEFT: P < 0.01 AND RIGHT: P < 0.05], IN GR. - I [LEFT: P < 0.05 AND RIGHT: P < 0.01], IN GR. - II [RIGHT: P < 0.05] AND IN GR. - III [LEFT: P < 0.05 AND RIGHT: P < 0.01]), BACK LEG STRENGTH (GROUP WISE P < 0.001, P < 0.05, P < 0.01 AND P < 0.05 RESPECTIVELY) AND FLEXIBILITY (ALL P < 0.001) WERE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION: HATHA YOGA CAN IMPROVE ANTHROPOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS, MUSCULAR STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY AMONG VOLUNTEERS OF DIFFERENT AGE GROUP AND CAN ALSO BE HELPFUL IN PREVENTING AND ATTENUATING AGE RELATED DETERIORATION OF THESE PARAMETERS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
14 1095  24 EFFECTS OF YOGA PRACTICE ON MUSCULAR ENDURANCE IN YOUNG WOMEN. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO VERIFY THE EFFECTS OF A SYSTEMATIZED YOGA PRACTICE ON MUSCULAR ENDURANCE IN YOUNG WOMEN. TWENTY SIX WOMEN (24 +/- 3.5 YEARS OLD) PARTICIPATED IN SIX WEEKS OF YOGA CLASSES, AND TWENTY ONE WOMEN (25 +/- 5.1 YEARS OLD) PARTICIPATED AS THE CONTROL GROUP. THE YOGA INTERVENTION WAS COMPOSED OF EIGHTEEN SESSIONS, THREE TIMES PER WEEK, AT 1 H PER SESSION. THE MUSCULAR ENDURANCE OF UPPER LIMBS (PUSH-UP) AND ABDOMINAL (SIT-UP) WAS ASSESSED THROUGH THE PROTOCOL SUGGESTED BY GETTMAN (1989) [1] AND GOLDING, MYERS AND SINNING (1989) [2] TO THE MAXIMUM REPETITIONS PERFORMED IN 1 MIN. TO VERIFY THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES INTRA GROUPS AND BETWEEN GROUPS A SPANOVA WAS PERFORMED, AND THE LEVEL OF SIGNIFICANCE WAS P </= 0.05. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA PROVIDES IMPROVEMENT IN UPPER LIMB AND IN ABDOMINAL MUSCULAR ENDURANCE.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
15  441  30 CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW EFFECTS OF YOGA TRAINING: PRELIMINARY EVALUATION OF 4 CASES. OBJECTIVES: EXPERIENCED PRACTITIONERS OF YOGA HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO ALTER BRAIN FUNCTION, BUT THIS CASE SERIES MEASURED CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW BEFORE AND AFTER A 12-WEEK TRAINING PROGRAM IN IYENGAR YOGA (IY) FOR NAIVE SUBJECTS. METHODS: ON THE FIRST DAY, EACH OF THE 4 SUBJECTS LISTENED TO THE TEACHER SPEAKING ON THE HISTORY AND BACKGROUND OF THE YOGA PROGRAM WHILE THEY WERE INJECTED WITH 250 MBQ OF (99M)TC-BICISATE AND RECEIVED A SINGLE PHOTON EMISSION COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY SCAN (PRE-PROGRAM BASELINE). SUBJECTS THEN HAD THEIR FIRST IY TRAINING AND WERE INJECTED AND SCANNED WITH 925 MBQ BICISATE WHILE THEY DID THEIR FIRST MEDITATION (PRE-PROGRAM MEDITATION). SUBJECTS THEN UNDERWENT A 12-WEEK TRAINING PROGRAM IN IY AND THEN UNDERWENT THE SAME IMAGING PROTOCOL WITH A POSTPROGRAM BASELINE AND POSTPROGRAM MEDITATION SCAN. BASELINE AND MEDITATION SCANS, BEFORE AND AFTER TRAINING, WERE COMPARED USING PAIRED T TESTS. RESULTS: THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DECREASES (P < 0.05) BETWEEN THE PRE- AND POSTPROGRAM BASELINE SCANS IN THE RIGHT AMYGDALA, DORSAL MEDIAL CORTEX, AND SENSORIMOTOR AREA. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE (P < 0.05) IN THE PRE- AND POSTPROGRAM PERCENTAGE CHANGE (I.E., ACTIVATION) IN THE RIGHT DORSAL MEDIAL FRONTAL LOBE, PREFRONTAL CORTEX, AND RIGHT SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX. CONCLUSIONS: THESE INITIAL FINDINGS SUGGEST THE BRAIN EXPERIENCES A "TRAINING EFFECT" AFTER 12 WEEKS OF IY TRAINING.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
16  436  29 CARDIORESPIRATORY AND METABOLIC CHANGES DURING YOGA SESSIONS: THE EFFECTS OF RESPIRATORY EXERCISES AND MEDITATION PRACTICES. THE NOVELTY OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE CHANGES IN CARDIORESPIRATORY AND METABOLIC INTENSITY BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE PRACTICE OF PRANAYAMAS (BREATHING EXERCISES OF YOGA) AND MEDITATION DURING THE SAME HATHA-YOGA SESSION. THE TECHNIQUE APPLIED WAS THE ONE ADVOCATED BY THE HATHA-YOGA SYSTEM. NINE YOGA INSTRUCTORS-FIVE FEMALES AND FOUR MALES, MEAN AGE OF 44+/-11, 6, WERE SUBJECTED TO ANALYSIS OF THE GASES EXPIRED DURING THREE DISTINCT PERIODS OF 30 MIN: REST, RESPIRATORY EXERCISES AND MEDITATIVE PRACTICE. A METABOLIC OPEN CIRCUIT COMPUTERIZED SYSTEM WAS APPLIED (VO2000, MEDGRAPHICS-USA). THE OXYGEN UPTAKE (VO(2)) AND THE CARBON DIOXIDE OUTPUT (VCO(2)) WERE STATISTICALLY DIFFERENT (P <OR= 0.05) DURING MEDITATION AND PRANAYAMA PRACTICES WHEN COMPARED WITH REST. THE HEART RATE ALSO SUFFERED RELEVANT REDUCTIONS WHEN RESULTS AT REST WERE COMPARED WITH THOSE DURING MEDITATION. A SMALLER PROPORTION OF LIPIDS WAS METABOLIZED DURING MEDITATION PRACTICE COMPARED WITH REST. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE MEDITATION USED IN THIS STUDY REDUCES THE METABOLIC RATE WHEREAS THE SPECIFIC PRANAYAMA TECHNIQUE IN THIS STUDY INCREASES IT WHEN COMPARED WITH THE REST STATE.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
17 1571  31 MANAGEMENT OF MYOFASCIAL PAIN DYSFUNCTION SYNDROME WITH MEDITATION AND YOGA: HEALING THROUGH NATURAL THERAPY. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY WERE TO STUDY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RAJ-YOGA MEDITATION AND PRANAYAMA IN PATIENTS WITH MYOFASCIAL PAIN DYSFUNCTION SYNDROME (MPDS) AND COMPARED THE EFFECTS WITH ONGOING CONVENTIONAL NONINVASIVE TREATMENT MODALITIES. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE STUDY COMPRISED 30 PATIENTS DIVIDED EQUALLY (10 EACH) INTO 3 GROUP, I.E., CONTROL GROUP (CONVENTIONAL, NONINVASIVE TREATMENT), EXPERIMENTAL A GROUP (CONVENTIONAL, NONINVASIVE TREATMENT WITH RAJ-YOGA MEDITATION THERAPY AND PRANAYAMA), AND EXPERIMENTAL B GROUP (RAJ-YOGA MEDITATION THERAPY AND PRANAYAMA ONLY). PARAMETERS SUCH AS PAIN, MOUTH OPENING, MANDIBULAR DEVIATION, INFLAMMATION, SWELLING, CLICKING, OCCLUSION, AND PSYCHOLOGIC EVALUATION SUCH AS ANXIETY, STRESS, AND DEPRESSION WERE ASSESSED BEFORE THE START OF THE STUDY AND AT WEEKLY INTERVALS FOR 3 MONTHS. RESULTS: POSTTREATMENT PAIN AND INFLAMMATION IMPROVED BOTH IN THE CONTROL GROUP AND EXPERIMENTAL A GROUP, BUT STATISTICALLY IT IS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT IN THE EXPERIMENTAL A GROUP. FURTHERMORE, IT IS EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY AS WELL AS FOR A LONG PERIOD IN EXPERIMENTAL A GROUP. IMPROVEMENT IN MOUTH OPENING WAS STATISTICALLY HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT IN CONTROL GROUP BUT NOT IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS. POSTTREATMENT ANXIETY AND STRESS STATUS WAS IMPROVED WITH STATISTICALLY HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT RESULT IN THE EXPERIMENTAL A AND B. THE POSTTREATMENT DEPRESSION STATUS ALONG WITH MANDIBULAR DEVIATION, SWELLING, CLICKING, AND OCCLUSION HAS NOT IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY IN ANY OF THE GROUPS. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION: RAJ-YOGA MEDITATION AND PRANAYAMA IN COMBINATION WITH CONVENTIONAL, NONINVASIVE, TREATMENT MODALITIES SHOWED PROMISING RESULTS IN MPDS PATIENTS AS COMPARED TO EITHER MODALITIES ALONE.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
18  316  18 AN INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY FOR BRONCHIAL ASTHMA: A 3-54-MONTH PROSPECTIVE STUDY. AFTER AN INITIAL INTEGRATED YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM OF 2 TO 4 WEEKS, 570 BRONCHIAL ASTHMATICS WERE FOLLOWED UP FOR 3 TO 54 MONTHS. THE TRAINING CONSISTED OF YOGA PRACTICES--YOGASANAS, PRANAYAMA, MEDITATION, AND KRIYAS--AND THEORY OF YOGA. RESULTS SHOW HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN MOST OF THE SPECIFIC PARAMETERS. THE REGULAR PRACTITIONERS SHOWED THE GREATEST IMPROVEMENT. PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PFR) VALUES SHOWED SIGNIFICANT MOVEMENT OF PATIENTS TOWARD NORMALCY AFTER YOGA, AND 72, 69, AND 66% OF THE PATIENTS HAVE STOPPED OR REDUCED PARENTERAL, ORAL, AND CORTISONE MEDICATION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE RESULTS ESTABLISH THE LONG-TERM EFFICACY OF THE INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA.	1986

GALVANIC SKIN RESISTANCE (GSR), BLOOD LACTATE AND URINARY VINYL MANDELIC ACID (U-VMA) WERE RECORDED AT 0, 3 AND 6 MONTHS. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES AT 3 & 6 MONTHS AS COMPARED TO 0 MONTH VALUES IN GSR, BLOOD LACTATE AND U-VMA LEVELS IN GROUP I SUBJECTS, BUT NOT IN GROUP II AND GROUP III SUBJECTS. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT REDUCTION IN STRESS FOLLOWING SAHAJA YOGA PRACTICE MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR CLINICAL IMPROVEMENT WHICH HAD BEEN EARLIER REPORTED IN PATIENTS WHO PRACTISED SAHAJA YOGA.	1995	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
20 2745  36 YOGA PRACTICE IMPROVES THE BODY MASS INDEX AND BLOOD PRESSURE: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: YOGA, AN ANCIENT INDIAN SYSTEM OF EXERCISE AND THERAPY IS AN ART OF GOOD LIVING OR AN INTEGRATED SYSTEM FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE BODY, MIND, AND INNER SPIRIT. REGULAR PRACTICE OF YOGA CAN HELP TO INCREASE BLOOD FLOW TO THE BRAIN, REDUCE STRESS, HAVE A CALMING EFFECT ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM, AND GREATLY HELP IN REDUCING HYPERTENSION. AIM: AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY IS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF 1-MONTH YOGA PRACTICE ON BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), AND BLOOD PRESSURE (BP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE PRESENT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICE ON 64 PARTICIPANTS (AGE 53.6 +/- 13.1 YEARS) (EXPERIMENTAL GROUP) WHEREAS THE RESULTS WERE COMPARED WITH 26 HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS (CONTROL GROUP). WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS IN A 1-MONTH PILOT STUDY. MOST OF THE PARTICIPANTS WERE LEARNER AND PRACTICED YOGA FOR 1 H DAILY IN THE MORNING FOR 1 MONTH. BMI AND BP (SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC) WERE STUDIED BEFORE AND AFTER 1 MONTH OF YOGA PRACTICE. RESULTS: YOGA PRACTICE CAUSES DECREASED BMI (26.4 +/- 2.5-25.22 +/- 2.4), SYSTOLIC BP (136.9 +/- 22.18 MMHG TO 133 +/- 21.38 MMHG), AND DIASTOLIC BP (84.7 +/- 6.5 MMHG TO 82.34 +/- 7.6 MMHG). ON THE OTHER HAND, NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE OBSERVED IN BMI AND BP OF CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY CONCLUDES THAT YOGA PRACTICE HAS POTENTIAL TO CONTROL BMI AND BP WITHOUT TAKING ANY MEDICATION.	2017

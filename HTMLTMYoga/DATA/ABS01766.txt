1 1766 89 POSTURAL CONTROL ADAPTATIONS IN YOGA SINGLE-LEG SUPPORT POSTURES: COMPARISON BETWEEN PRACTITIONERS AND NONPRACTITIONERS. THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES WHETHER A GROUP OF REGULAR YOGA PRACTITIONERS SHOWS POSTURAL CONTROL DIFFERENCES COMPARED WITH HEALTHY CONTROLS WHILE PERFORMING SINGLE-LEG YOGA POSTURES. TEN YOGA PRACTITIONERS WERE COMPARED WITH A CONTROL GROUP OF 10 NONPRACTITIONERS PERFORMING TWO SINGLE-LEG SUPPORT YOGA POSTURES: VRKSASANA (TREE POSTURE) AND NATARAJASANA (DANCER POSTURE). RAMBLING AND TREMBLING DECOMPOSITION OF THE CENTER OF PRESSURE TRAJECTORIES WAS IMPLEMENTED USING A GENETIC ALGORITHM SPECTRAL OPTIMIZATION THAT AVOIDS USING HORIZONTAL FORCES AND WAS VALIDATED WITH BIPEDAL POSTURE DATA. ADDITIONALLY, THE CENTER OF MASS WAS ESTIMATED FROM BODY KINEMATICS USING OPENSIM AND COMPARED WITH THE RAMBLING OUTPUTS. DURING NATARAJASANA, NO POSTURAL CONTROL ADAPTATIONS WERE OBSERVED. FOR VRKSASANA, THE YOGA PRACTITIONERS SHOWED A LOWER CENTER OF PRESSURE ELLIPSE CONFIDENCE INTERVAL AREA, CENTER OF PRESSURE ANTEROPOSTERIOR SD, AND SMALLER RAMBLING SD IN THE MEDIOLATERAL DIRECTION, SUGGESTING POSSIBLE SUPRASPINAL FEED-FORWARD MOTOR ADAPTATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA TRAINING.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
2 2027 39 TAI CHI AND YOGA FOR IMPROVING BALANCE ON ONE LEG: A NEUROIMAGING AND BIOMECHANICS STUDY. THE ONE-LEG STANCE IS FREQUENTLY USED IN BALANCE TRAINING AND REHABILITATION PROGRAMS FOR VARIOUS BALANCE DISORDERS. THERE ARE SOME TYPICAL ONE-LEG STANCE POSTURES IN TAI CHI (TC) AND YOGA, WHICH ARE NORMALLY USED FOR IMPROVING BALANCE. HOWEVER, THE MECHANISM IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. BESIDES, THE DIFFERENCES OF ONE-LEG STANCE POSTURES BETWEEN TC AND YOGA IN TRAINING BALANCE ARE STILL UNKNOWN. THEREFORE, THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE CORTICAL ACTIVATION AND RAMBLING AND TREMBLING TRAJECTORIES TO ELUCIDATE THE POSSIBLE MECHANISM OF IMPROVING ONE-LEG STANCE BALANCE, AND COMPARE THE POSTURAL DEMANDS DURING ONE-LEG STANCE POSTURES BETWEEN TC AND YOGA. THIRTY-TWO HEALTHY YOUNG INDIVIDUALS WERE RECRUITED TO PERFORM TWO TC ONE-LEG STANCE POSTURES, I.E., RIGHT HEEL KICK (RHK) AND LEFT LOWER BODY AND STAND ON ONE LEG (LSOL), TWO YOGA POSTURES, I.E., ONE-LEG BALANCE AND TREE, AND NORMAL ONE-LEG STANDING (OLS). BRAIN ACTIVATION IN THE PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX, SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA (SMA), AND DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX (DLPFC) WAS MEASURED USING FUNCTIONAL NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY. THE CENTER OF PRESSURE WAS SIMULTANEOUSLY RECORDED USING A FORCE PLATFORM AND DECOMPOSED INTO RAMBLING AND TREMBLING COMPONENTS. ONE-WAY REPEATED-MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE WAS USED FOR THE MAIN EFFECTS. THE RELATIVE CONCENTRATION CHANGES OF OXYGENATED HEMOGLOBIN (DELTAHBO) IN SMA WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER DURING RHK, LSOL, AND TREE THAN THAT DURING OLS (P < 0.001). RHK (P < 0.001), LSOL (P = 0.003), AND TREE (P = 0.006) ALL SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER ROOT MEAN SQUARE RAMBLING (RMRMS) THAN THAT DURING OLS IN THE MEDIAL-LATERAL DIRECTION. THE RIGHT DLPFC ACTIVATION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER DURING THE RHK THAN THAT DURING THE TREE (P = 0.023), OLB (P < 0.001), AND OLS (P = 0.013) POSTURES. IN CONCLUSION, THE RHK, LSOL, AND TREE COULD BE USED AS TRAINING MOVEMENTS FOR PEOPLE WITH IMPAIRED BALANCE. FURTHERMORE, THE RHK IN TC MAY PROVIDE MORE COGNITIVE TRAINING IN POSTURAL CONTROL THAN TREE AND OLB IN YOGA. KNOWLEDGE FROM THIS STUDY COULD BE USED AND IMPLEMENTED IN TRAINING ONE-LEG STANCE BALANCE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
3 2257 18 THE PHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATES OF KUNDALINI YOGA MEDITATION: A STUDY OF A YOGA MASTER. THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE PHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATES OF A HIGHLY PRACTICED KUNDALINI YOGA MEDITATOR. THORACIC AND ABDOMINAL BREATHING PATTERNS, HEART RATE (HR), OCCIPITAL PARIETAL ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPH (EEG), SKIN CONDUCTANCE LEVEL (SCL), AND BLOOD VOLUME PULSE (BVP) WERE MONITORED DURING PREBASELINE, MEDITATION, AND POSTBASELINE PERIODS. VISUAL ANALYSES OF THE DATA SHOWED A DECREASE IN RESPIRATION RATE DURING THE MEDITATION FROM A MEAN OF 11 BREATHS/MIN FOR THE PRE- AND 13 BREATHS/MIN FOR THE POSTBASELINE TO A MEAN OF 5 BREATHS/MIN DURING THE MEDITATION, WITH A PREDOMINANCE OF ABDOMINAL/DIAPHRAGMATIC BREATHING. THERE WAS ALSO MORE ALPHA EEG ACTIVITY DURING THE MEDITATION (M = 1.71 MICROV) COMPARED TO THE PRE- (M = .47 MICROV) AND POSTBASELINE (M = .78 MICROV) PERIODS, AND AN INCREASE IN THETA EEG ACTIVITY IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE MEDITATION (M = .62 MICROV) COMPARED TO THE PRE-BASELINE AND MEDITATIVE PERIODS (EACH WITH M = .26 MICROV). THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT A SHIFT IN BREATHING PATTERNS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALPHA EEG, AND THOSE PATTERNS NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED FURTHER.	2001	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
4 2396 12 YOGA AND CHEMOREFLEX RESPONSE TO HYPOXIA AND HYPERCAPNIA. WE TESTED WHETHER CHEMOREFLEX SENSITIVITY COULD BE AFFECTED BY THE PRACTICE OF YOGA, AND WHETHER THIS IS SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF A SLOW BREATHING RATE OBTAINED DURING YOGA OR AS A GENERAL CONSEQUENCE OF YOGA. WE FOUND THAT SLOW BREATHING RATE PER SE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED CHEMOREFLEX SENSITIVITY, BUT LONG-TERM YOGA PRACTICE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR A GENERALISED REDUCTION IN CHEMOREFLEX.	2000

THIS PAPER AIMS TO SHOW THAT AN AGE-OLD YOGA PRACTICE, CALLED UDDHYANA BHANDA AND NOULI, IS AN EFFECTIVE MEANS OF CORE STABILITY.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
6  918 15 EFFECTIVENESS OF TRAINING PROGRAM COMBINING CHAKRAYOGA AND MEDITATION. BACKGROUND THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PROGRAM COMBINING CHAKRAYOGA AND MEDITATION ON THE PHYSICAL HEALTH AND DISEASE-RELATED FACTORS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS OF PEOPLE. METHODS NINETY-SEVEN SUBJECTS (32-83 YEARS OLD) WHO HAD FREE FROM PRIOR EXPERIENCES IN MEDITATION PROGRAMS OR CHAKRAYOGA TRAINING COURSES WERE ASSIGNED TO EITHER THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (EXP) (45 SUBJECTS; 13 MALE SUBJECTS AND 32 FEMALE SUBJECTS; AVERAGE AGE OF 60.67 YEARS, SD=11.09 YEARS) OR THE CONTROL GROUP (CONT) OF REMAINING SUBJECTS (52 SUBJECTS; 14 MALE SUBJECTS AND 38 FEMALE SUBJECTS; AVERAGE AGE OF 61.58 YEARS, SD=9.70 YEARS). SUBJECTS IN THE EXP PARTICIPATED IN THE CHAKRAYOGA MEDITATION PROGRAM FOR TWICE A WEEK FOR 2 H DURING 6 WEEKS IN EACH SESSION CONSISTED OF 1 H OF CHAKRAYOGA AND 1 H OF MEDITATION. THE MEASUREMENTS IN THIS STUDY INCLUDED THE MINDFULNESS, STRESS RESPONSE, SUBJECTIVE QUALITY OF LIFE, MEDICAL SYMPTOM CHECKLIST, DIFFICULTY IN EMOTIONAL REGULATION AND OBJECTIVE OF LIFE AND SENSE OF CONTROL. RESULTS RESULTS REVEALED THAT PARTICIPANTS IN THE EXP REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE RELIEF OF MINDFULNESS, STRESS RESPONSE, SUBJECTIVE QUALITY OF LIFE AND MEDICAL SYMPTOM CHECKLIST THAN THOSE IN THE CONT. CONCLUSIONS THESE FINDINGS PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT THE CHAKRAYOGA MEDITATION PROGRAM CAN HELP RELIEVE THE PHYSICAL HEALTH AND DISEASE-RELATED FACTORS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
7 2905 20 [LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF BREATHING EXERCISES AND YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA]. TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF BREATHING EXERCISES (BE) OR YOGA (Y) ON THE COURSE OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA WE STUDIED 36 SUBJECTS WITH A MILD DISEASE. THE PATIENTS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO 3 GROUPS. 2 OF THEM PARTICIPATED IN A 3 WEEKS TRAINING PROGRAM OF BE OR Y WHILE THE THIRD GROUP RESTED WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL TREATMENT (CONTROL GROUP, C). AT THE END OF THE TRAINING PERIOD THE PATIENTS WERE ASKED TO PRACTISE BE OR Y ON THEIR OWN. DRUG THERAPY AND LUNG FUNCTION PARAMETERS BEFORE AND AFTER A BETA 2-AGONIST METERED DOSE INHALER (ALBUTEROL, ALB) WERE RECORDED PRIOR TO THE TRAINING PROGRAM AND IN 4 WEEKS INTERVALS FOR 4 MONTHS THEREAFTER. THE RESPONSE TO THE BETA 2-AGONIST WAS DOCUMENTED CONTINUOUSLY IN 28 PATIENTS. THE MENTAL STATE OF THE PATIENTS WAS ELUCIDATED BY QUESTIONNAIRES.--PRIOR TO THE STUDY A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF INHALED ALB ON THE FEV1 WAS SHOWN WITHOUT ANY SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN GROUP DIFFERENCES. BOTH, BE AND Y, CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT AMELIORATION OF THE MENTAL STATE BUT ONLY THE BE INDUCED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OF LUNG FUNCTION PARAMETERS COMPARED TO THE INDIVIDUAL BASELINE VALUES. THE FEV1 INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY BY 356.3 +/- 146.2 ML (P < 0.05) AND THE VC BY 225.0 +/- 65.5 ML (P < 0.01). THESE LONG-TERM CHANGES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE ACTUAL RESPONSE TO ALB. BE DECREASED THE RV SIGNIFICANTLY BY 306.3 +/- 111.6 ML (P < 0.05), AN EFFECT SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COMPARED TO THE BETA 2-AGONIST (P < 0.01). BE IN COMBINATION WITH ALB CAUSED AN ADDITIVE EFFECT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	1994	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
8  509 25 COMPARATIVE IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF DIFFERENT YOGA ASANAS ON HEART RATE AND BLOOD PRESSURE IN HEALTHY YOUNG VOLUNTEERS. INTRODUCTION: THIS STUDY PLANNED TO COMPARE IMMEDIATE CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT YOGA ASANAS IN HEALTHY YOUNG VOLUNTEERS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HEART RATE (HR), SYSTOLIC PRESSURE (SP), AND DIASTOLIC PRESSURE (DP), BLOOD PRESSURE (BP), WERE RECORDED USING THE NON INVASIVE BLOOD PRESSURE (NIBP) APPARATUS IN 22 HEALTHY YOUNG SUBJECTS, BEFORE AND AFTER THE PERFORMANCE OF DHANURASANA (DA), VAKRASANA (VA) (BOTH SIDES), JANUSIRASASANA (JSA) (BOTH SIDES), MATSYASANA AND SHAVASANA FOR 30 S. HR AND BP WERE FURTHER RECORDED DURING SUPINE RECOVERY AT 2, 4, 6, 8, AND 10 MIN. A REPEATED MEASURE OF ANOVA WAS USED FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. RESULTS: THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN HR AND BP BOTH IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ASANAS AS WELL AS DURING THE RECOVERY PERIOD. OVERALL COMPARISONS OF % CHANGES IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ASANAS REVEALED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WITH REGARD TO HR THAT INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER DA. IN THE RECOVERY PHASE, THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT INTERGROUP DIFFERENCES FROM 2 MIN ONWARD IN BOTH SP AND DP. THE DECREASE OF SP AFTER VA (RIGHT SIDE) (VA-R) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN SHAVASANA (4(TH), 6(TH), AND 8(TH) MIN) AND JSA (LEFT SIDE) (JSA-L) AT 6(TH) AND 8(TH) MIN. DP DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER PERFORMING JSA-L COMPARED TO VA-R AT THE 6(TH) AND 8(TH) MIN. DISCUSSION: THE CARDIOVASCULAR CHANGES IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ASANAS AND DURING THE RECOVERY PHASE REVEAL INHERENT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SELECTED POSTURES. THE RISE OF HR IN DA MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO INCREASED SYMPATHETIC RESPONSE DUE TO THE RELATIVE DIFFICULTY OF THE POSTURE AS WELL AS ABDOMINAL COMPRESSION OCCURRING IN IT. THE EFFECT OF SUPINE RELAXATION IS MORE PRONOUNCED AFTER THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ASANAS AS COMPARED TO MERE RELAXATION IN SHAVASANA. THIS MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO A NORMALIZATION AND RESULTANT HOMEOSTATIC EFFECT OCCURRING DUE TO A GREATER, HEALTHIER DE-ACTIVATION OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM OCCURRING TOWING TO THE PRESENCE OF PRIOR ACTIVATION. THERE WERE ALSO SUBTLE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RIGHT SIDED AND LEFT SIDED PERFORMANCE OF VA AND JSA THAT MAY BE OCCURRING DUE TO THE DIFFERENT INTERNAL STRUCTURES BEING EITHER COMPRESSED OR RELAXED ON EITHER SIDE. CONCLUSION: OUR STUDY PROVIDES INITIAL EVIDENCE OF DIFFERENTIAL CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS OF ASANAS AND SUBTLE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RIGHT AND LEFT SIDED PERFORMANCE. FURTHER, CARDIOVASCULAR RECOVERY IS GREATER AFTER THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ASANAS AS COMPARED TO SHAVASAN; THUS, IMPLYING A BETTER RESPONSE WHEN EFFORT PRECEDES RELAXATION.	2014	

9 2757 17 YOGA PRACTICES AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING OF STUDENT NURSES. YOGA HAS BEEN WITH US SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL, BUT IT IS ONLY DURING RECENT YEARS THAT IT HAS ASSUMED WORLDWIDE IMPORTANCE. THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE CT OF SELECTED YOGA PRACTICES ON PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING. IN THIS QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL ONE GROUP PRE-TEST AND POST- TEST STUDY, 83 UNDER GRADUATE STUDENT NURSES. WERE TAUGHT SELECTED YOGA EXERCISES. THE SE- LECTED YOGA EXERCISES WERE SYSTEMATIC RELAXATION, BREATHING, AND STRETCHING THAT WERE PER- FORMED IN THE FORMATIVE MANNER. THE' INTERVENTION WAS CARRIED OUT FOR THE MINIMAL DURATION OF ONE HOUR PER DAY, THREE DAYS A WEEK FOR A PERIOD OF 6 WEEKS. ASSESSMENT WAS- CARRIED OUT ON THE FIRST AND LAST- DAY OF THE INTERVENTION, USING-A MODIFIED HINDI VERSION OF POSITIVE AFFECT AND NEGATIVE AFFECT SCALE, (PANAS-H). IT,HAS 10 QUESTIONS EACH TO MEASURE POSITIVE (PA) AND NEGA- TIVE AFFECT (NA). SINCE THE DATA WAS TESTED AND FORMED A NORMAL DISTRIBUTION, THE PAIRED 'T' TEST WAS USED FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. THE. MEAN PA SCORE OF 42.92 AFTER YOGA PRACTICE WAS STATISTI- CALLY HIGHER THAN THE MEAN PA SCORE OF 32. 50 BEFORE YOGA PRACTICE (P=O. 01). THE MEAN NA SCORE OF 20.75 AFTER YOGA PRACTICE WAS LOWER THAN THE MEAN NA SCORE OF 23.33 BEFORE YOGA PRACTICE (P=0.427). THE YOGA PRACTICE CAN BE TAUGHT TO NORMALPARTICIPANTS AS IT MAY REDUCE NEGATIVE AFFECT AND INCREASE THE POSITIVE AFFECT WITHIN A FEW WEEKS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
10  736 21 EFFECT OF PRACTICING YOGA ON CERVICAL VESTIBULAR EVOKED MYOGENIC POTENTIAL. THE PRESENT STUDY ATTEMPTED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF PRACTICING YOGA ON FUNCTIONING OF SACCULO-COLLIC PATHWAY USING CERVICAL VESTIBULAR EVOKED MYOGENIC POTENTIAL (CVEMP). CVEMP WAS RECORDED FROM 40 PARTICIPANTS (20 WHO PRACTICE YOGA REGULARLY AND 20 WHO DO NOT PRACTICE YOGA REGULARLY). THE DIFFERENCES IN AMPLITUDE OF P1, N1, P1-N1 COMPLEX, ASYMMETRY RATIO AND LATENCIES OF P1 AND N1 OF CVEMP WERE COMPARED BETWEEN BOTH THE GROUPS. THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY SHOWED THAT THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE (P < 0.05) IN THE AMPLITUDE OF P1, N1 AND P1-N1 COMPLEX AND A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN LATENCY (P < 0.05) FOR EXPERIMENTAL GROUP. THE ASYMMETRY RATIO IN INDIVIDUALS WHO PRACTICE YOGA WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER (MEAN = 6.73) COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP (MEAN = 19.13). MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION ANALYSES SUGGESTED THAT THE NUMBER OF YEARS OF YOGA PRACTICE SIGNIFICANTLY PREDICTED THE AMPLITUDE OF P1-N1 COMPLEX (BETA = 0.70, P < 0.01) AND AMPLITUDE RATIO (BETA = 0.72, P < 0.01). THUS, PRACTICING YOGA IMPROVES POSTURAL CONTROL AND STRENGTHENS THE MUSCLES AND VESTIBULAR SYSTEM LEADING TO ENHANCED CVEMP RESPONSES. THE PLASTIC CHANGES IN THE VESTIBULAR SYSTEM AND INCREASED MUSCULAR STRENGTH BECAUSE OF CONSTANT PRACTICING OF YOGA COULD HAVE LED TO CHANGES IN CVEMP RESPONSES. HOWEVER, FURTHER STUDIES ON A LARGER GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR BETTER CLINICAL APPLICABILITY OF THE RESULTS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
11 2115 19 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH HAEMOPHILIA. THE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY HAEMOPHILIA LEAD TO IMPAIRMENTS OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH HAEMOPHILIA. THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH HAEMOPHILIA IN SHIRAZ, IRAN. THIS SEMI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WITH PRE- AND POST-TEST DESIGN WAS PERFORMED ON 27 BOYS BETWEEN 8 AND 16 YEARS OLD WHO SUFFERED FROM HAEMOPHILIA. THE PATIENTS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS. THE NUMBER OF BLEEDINGS, ABSENCES FROM SCHOOL, AND REFERRALS TO THE CLINIC WAS EVALUATED. THE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH INTERVIEWS AND USING THE PATIENTS' RECORDS IN THE HAEMOPHILIA CENTER. BESIDES, THE QUALITY OF LIFE WAS ASSESSED THROUGH THE HAEMO-QOL QUESTIONNAIRE. THEN, THE YOGA INTERVENTION WAS PERFORMED FOR 14 WEEKS AND THE DATA WERE COLLECTED IN THREE STAGES. THE COLLECTED DATA WERE ENTERED INTO THE SPSS STATISTICAL SOFTWARE, VERSION 18 AND WERE ANALYZED USING NON-PARAMETRIC FRIEDMAN TEST. AFTER THE INTERVENTION, SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED IN THE MEAN SCORES OF QUALITY OF LIFE DIMENSIONS AND THE NUMBER OF BLEEDINGS, SCHOOL ABSENCES, AND REFERRALS TO THE HAEMOPHILIA CLINIC (P<0.001). THUS, YOGA MAY IMPROVE THE HAEMOPHILIA CHILDREN'S AND ADOLESCENTS' PERCEPTION OF QUALITY OF LIFE WITHOUT THE RISK OF INJURY. THIS INTERVENTION ALSO SEEMED TO BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE NUMBER OF BLEEDINGS, REFERRALS TO THE HAEMOPHILIA CLINIC, AND ABSENCES FROM SCHOOL.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
12 2160 25 THE EFFECTS OF WEIGHT BEARING YOGA TRAINING ON THE BONE RESORPTION MARKERS OF THE POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. THIS STUDY WAS A PRELIMINARY REPORT TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF THE WEIGHT BEARING YOGA TRAINING ON BOTH BONE RESORPTION MARKER AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF THE POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. THE SAMPLES WERE RECRUITED BY THE PURPOSIVE SAMPLING FROM THE FEMALE CHULALONGKORN UNIVERSITY STAFF AGED BETWEEN 50-60 YEARS. THE SUBJECTS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND CONTROL GROUP. THE BASELINE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA, THE BONE RESORPTION MARKER (BETA-CROSSLAPS), THE BONE FORMATION MARKER (P1NP) AND QUALITY OF LIFE (SF-36) DATA WERE COLLECTED. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP ATTENDED THE 12-WEEK WEIGHT-BEARING YOGA TRAINING 3 DAYS A WEEK, 50 MINUTES A DAY WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP LIVED THEIR NORMAL LIVES. AFTER 12TH WEEK, THE DATA COLLECTIONS WERE REPEATED IN BOTH GROUPS. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (19 SUBJECTS, THE MEAN AGE 54.320 YRS) AND THE CONTROL GROUP (14 SUBJECTS, THE MEAN AGE 54.430 YRS) WERE RECRUITED. THE MEAN ULTRASOUND BMD OF BOTH HEELS IN BOTH GROUPS SHOWED NO OSTEOPENIA OR OSTEOPOROSIS. AFTER THE 12-WEEK TRAINING, THE MEAN BONE RESORPTION MARKER (BETA-CROSSLAPS) OF THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP REDUCED FROM 0.464 TO 0.339 NG/ML (-26.939%) WHEREAS THE CONTROL GROUP REDUCED FROM 0.389 TO 0.386 NG/ML (-0.771%). THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE (P < 0.05). THE MEAN OF THE BONE FORMATION MARKERS (PINP) IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP REDUCED FROM 55.393 TO 42.401 NG/ML (-23.454%) AND THE BONE FORMATION MARKERS (PINP) IN THE CONTROL GROUP REDUCED FROM 61.903 TO 44.832 NG/ML (-27.577%). IN THE AREA OF THE LIFE QUALITY MEASUREMENT OF BOTH GROUPS, THE DATA OBTAINED FROM THE MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY SHORT-FORM SURVEY (SF-36) SHOWED THAT THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AT 0.05 LEVELS FOR THE PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING, BODILY PAIN, GENERAL HEALTH, AND VITALITY. THE VARIANCE OF PERCENTAGE CHANGE VALUE OF THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP INCREASED TO +25.299, +16.565, +15.309, AND +21.056. THE VARIANCE OF PERCENTAGE CHANGE VALUE OF THE CONTROL GROUP INCREASED TO +12.946, -1.221, -9.303 AND +2.291. THE WEIGH-BEARING YOGA TRAINING HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON BONE BY SLOWING DOWN BONE RESORPTION WHICH WAS A VERY ESSENTIAL INDICATOR FOR HUMAN HEALTH BECAUSE IT REDUCED THE OSTEOPOROSIS RISKS IN THE POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. ADDITIONALLY, YOGA TRAINING PROMOTED BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
13 1420 23 IMPROVED PERFORMANCE IN THE TOWER OF LONDON TEST FOLLOWING YOGA. TWENTY GIRLS BETWEEN 10 AND 13 YEARS OF AGE, STUDYING AT A RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO TWO GROUPS. ONE GROUP PRACTICED YOGA FOR ONE HOUR FIFTEEN MINUTES PER DAY, 7 DAYS A WEEK, WHILE THE OTHER GROUP WAS GIVEN PHYSICAL TRAINING FOR THE SAME TIME. TIME FOR PLANNING AND FOR EXECUTION AND THE NUMBER OF MOVES REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE TOWER OF LONDON TASK WERE ASSESSED FOR BOTH GROUPS AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF A MONTH. THESE THREE ASSESSMENTS WERE SEPARATELY TESTED IN INCREASINGLY COMPLEX TASKS REQUIRING 2-MOVES, 4-MOVES AND 5-MOVES. THE PRE-POST DATA WERE COMPARED USING THE WILCOXON PAIRED SIGNED RANKS TEST. THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PLANNING TIME FOR BOTH 2-MOVES AND 4-MOVES TASKS (53.9 AND 59.1 PERCENT RESPECTIVELY), EXECUTION TIME IN BOTH 4-MOVES AND 5-MOVES TASKS (63.7 AND 60.3 PERCENT RESPECTIVELY), AND IN THE NUMBER OF MOVES IN THE 4-MOVES TASKS (20.9 PERCENT). THE PHYSICAL TRAINING GROUP SHOWED NO CHANGE. HENCE YOGA TRAINING FOR A MONTH REDUCED THE PLANNING AND EXECUTION TIME IN SIMPLE (2-MOVES) AS WELL AS COMPLEX TASKS (4, 5-MOVES) AND FACILITATED REACHING THE TARGET WITH A SMALLER NUMBER OF MOVES IN A COMPLEX TASK (4-MOVES).	2001	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
14  447 16 CHANGED PATTERN OF REGIONAL GLUCOSE METABOLISM DURING YOGA MEDITATIVE RELAXATION. USING POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY (PET), MEASUREMENTS OF THE REGIONAL CEREBRAL METABOLIC RATE OF GLUCOSE (RCMRGLC) ARE ABLE TO DELINEATE CEREBRAL METABOLIC RESPONSES TO EXTERNAL OR MENTAL STIMULATION. IN ORDER TO EXAMINE POSSIBLE CHANGES OF BRAIN METABOLISM DUE TO YOGA MEDITATION PET SCANS WERE PERFORMED IN 8 MEMBERS OF A YOGA MEDITATION GROUP DURING THE NORMAL CONTROL STATE (C) AND YOGA MEDITATIVE RELAXATION (YMR). WHEREAS THERE WERE INTRAINDIVIDUAL CHANGES OF THE TOTAL CMRGLC, THE ALTERATIONS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR INTERGROUP COMPARISON; SPECIFIC FOCAL CHANGES OR CHANGES IN THE INTERHEMISPHERIC DIFFERENCES IN METABOLISM WERE ALSO NOT SEEN; HOWEVER THE RATIOS OF FRONTAL VS. OCCIPITAL RCMRGLC WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ELEVATED (P LESS THAN 0.05) DURING YMR. THESE ALTERED RATIOS WERE CAUSED BY A SLIGHT INCREASE OF FRONTAL RCMRGLC AND A MORE PRONOUNCED REDUCTION IN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY VISUAL CENTERS. THESE DATA INDICATE A HOLISTIC BEHAVIOR OF THE BRAIN METABOLISM DURING THE TIME OF ALTERED STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS DURING YMR.	1990	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
15 2771 15 YOGA REDUCES SYMPTOMS OF DISTRESS IN TSUNAMI SURVIVORS IN THE ANDAMAN ISLANDS. A MONTH AFTER THE DECEMBER 2004 TSUNAMI THE EFFECT OF A 1 WEEK YOGA PROGRAM WAS EVALUATED ON SELF RATED FEAR, ANXIETY, SADNESS AND DISTURBED SLEEP IN 47 SURVIVORS IN THE ANDAMAN ISLANDS. POLYGRAPH RECORDINGS OF THE HEART RATE, BREATH RATE AND SKIN RESISTANCE WERE ALSO MADE. AMONG THE 47 PEOPLE, 31 WERE SETTLERS FROM THE MAINLAND (I.E. INDIA, ML GROUP) AND 16 WERE ENDOGENOUS PEOPLE (EP GROUP). THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN SELF RATED FEAR, ANXIETY, SADNESS AND DISTURBED SLEEP IN BOTH GROUPS, AND IN THE HEART AND BREATH RATE IN THE ML GROUP, AND IN THE BREATH RATE ALONE IN THE EP GROUP, FOLLOWING YOGA (P < 0.05, T-TEST). THIS SUGGESTS THAT YOGA PRACTICE MAY BE USEFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF STRESS FOLLOWING A NATURAL DISASTER IN PEOPLE WITH WIDELY DIFFERING SOCIAL, CULTURAL AND SPIRITUAL BELIEFS.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
16 1932 20 ROLE OF YOGA IN MODIFYING ANXIETY LEVEL IN WOMEN. ANXIETY LEADS TO DERANGEMENT IN PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. ANXIETY LEVELS ARE MORE IN FULL TIME HOUSEWIVES THAN WORKING WOMEN. THERE IS A NEED FOR SIMPLE, EASY TREATMENT FOR ANXIETY TO ALLEVIATE THE BURDEN ON HEALTH CAUSED BY ANXIETY. YOGA IS AMONG THE TOP TEN COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE THERAPIES. OUR STUDY AIMED TO DETERMINE THE ANXIETY LEVELS IN APPARENTLY HEALTHY FULL TIME HOUSEWIVES AND TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON ANXIETY LEVELS AMONG THEM. PRESENT STUDY IS A COMPARATIVE INTERVENTIONAL STUDY. STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON 50 APPARENTLY HEALTHY FULL TIME HOUSEWIVES (20-50 YEARS) WHO ATTENDED ONE MONTH YOGA CAMP. HAMILTON ANXIETY (HAMA) SCALE WAS USED TO EVALUATE ANXIETY LEVELS BEFORE AND AT THE END OF THE YOGA CAMP. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS DONE BY PAIRED T TEST USING SPSS 9.0. THE BASELINE PULSE RATE, SBP, DBP WERE 82.90 +/- 4.25 BPM, 124.84 +/- 11.022 MM HG, 85.20 +/- 10.81 MM HG RESPECTIVELY. AFTER FOUR WEEKS YOGA CAMP THERE WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT LOWERING OF PULSE RATE (77.58 +/- 3.86 BPM), SBP (117.92 +/- 6.76 MM HG), DBP (78.68 +/- 6.62 MM HG). BEFORE YOGA TRAINING, PERCENTAGE DISTRIBUTIONS OF SUBJECTS WITH MILD, MODERATE AND SEVERE ANXIETY WERE 6%, 18% AND 76% RESPECTIVELY. AT THE END OF FOUR WEEK YOGA TRAINING, PERCENTAGE DISTRIBUTIONS OF SUBJECTS WITH MILD, MODERATE AND SEVERE ANXIETY WERE 44.23%, 19.23% AND 36.53% RESPECTIVELY. THERE WAS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT (P = 0.000) DIFFERENCE IN THE MEAN VALUES OF TOTAL SCORE BEFORE (33.71 +/- 4.90) AND AFTER (26.93 +/- 4.53) YOGA. THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THERE WAS A REDUCTION IN THE SEVERITY OF ANXIETY FROM SEVERE TO MODERATE AND MILD INDICATING DECREASE IN ANXIETY FOLLOWING YOGA. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR STUDY, WE CONCLUDE THAT REGULAR YOGIC PRACTICES AND ADAPTING AND IMPLEMENTING THE PRINCIPALS AND PHILOSOPHY OF YOGA IN DAY TO DAY LIFE MAY DECREASE THE ANXIETY LEVEL.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
17  417 21 BODY TEMPERATURE IN PRACTITIONERS OF A YOGA BREATHING TECHNIQUE CONSIDERED TO BE HEAT GENERATING. CONTEXT: SURYABHEDA PRANAYAMA IS TRADITIONALLY DESCRIBED AS "INCREASING THE INNER FIRE" AND IS BELIEVED TO BE HEAT GENERATING. AIMS: THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED AT DETERMINING WHETHER THE SURFACE BODY TEMPERATURE WOULD INCREASE AFTER SURYABHEDA PRANAYAMA PRACTICE COMPARED WITH SITTING QUIETLY FOR THE SAME DURATION AS A CONTROL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: NINETEEN PARTICIPANTS WITH EXPERIENCE OF SURYABHEDA PRANAYAMA PRACTICE (GROUP MEAN EXPERIENCE +/- STANDARD DEVIATION, 30.2 +/- 22.8 MONTHS) WERE ASSESSED IN 3 SESSIONS ON SEPARATE DAYS. THE SESSIONS WERE (I) SURYABHEDA PRANAYAMA WITH PHYSIOLOGICAL LOCKS OR BREATH RETENTION, (II) SURYABHEDA PRANAYAMA WITHOUT PHYSIOLOGICAL LOCKS OR BREATH RETENTION, AND (III) QUIET SITTING (CONTROL SESSION). THE AXILLARY SURFACE BODY TEMPERATURE WAS MONITORED IN ALL THREE SESSIONS BEFORE (5 MIN), DURING (15 MIN), AND AFTER (5 MIN) THE INTERVENTION. AMBIENT TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY IN THE RECORDING CABIN USED FOR TESTING WERE NOTED. FROM THE AMBIENT TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY, THE HEAT INDEX WAS DERIVED. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSES OF VARIANCE WERE PERFORMED TO COMPARE VALUES BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER THE 3 SESSIONS, USING SPSS VERSION 24.0. RESULTS: THE SURFACE BODY TEMPERATURE INCREASED DURING AND AFTER SURYABHEDA PRANAYAMA WITH PHYSIOLOGICAL LOCKS (P < 0.001; P < 0.001), SURYABHEDA PRANAYAMA WITHOUT PHYSIOLOGICAL LOCKS (P < 0.01; P < 0.001), AND QUIET SITTING (P < 0.001; P < 0.001) COMPARED TO THE RESPECTIVE BEFORE VALUES. CONCLUSION: THE CONTROL (I.E., QUIET SITTING) AND EXPERIMENTAL SESSIONS (I.E., SURYABHEDA WITH LOCKS AND SURYABHEDA WITHOUT LOCKS) SHOWED A COMPARABLE INCREASE IN THE SURFACE BODY TEMPERATURE. HENCE, THE INCREASE IN SURFACE BODY TEMPERATURE DURING AND AFTER EXPERIMENTAL SESSIONS DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE RELATED TO THE PRANAYAMA TECHNIQUES. THE POSSIBLE FACTORS WHICH MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASED SURFACE BODY TEMPERATURE IN THE CONTROL AND EXPERIMENTAL SESSIONS HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
18 2005 16 STUDY OF PULMONARY AND AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS OF ASTHMA PATIENTS AFTER YOGA TRAINING. "THE CONCEPT OF YOGA IS HELPFUL FOR THE TREATMENT OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA", HAS CREATED A GREAT INTEREST IN THE MEDICAL RESEARCH FIELD. IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS AND PULMONARY FUNCTIONS ARE IMPROVED IN ASTHMA PATIENTS AFTER SHORT TERM YOGA TRAINING, A STUDY WAS CONDUCTED WITH NINE DIAGNOSED BRONCHIAL ASTHMA PATIENTS. YOGA TRAINING WAS GIVEN FOR SEVEN DAYS IN A CAMP IN ADHYATMA SADHNA KENDRA, NEW DELHI. THE AUTONOMIC FUNCTION TESTS TO MEASURE THE PARASYMPATHETIC REACTIVITY (DEEP BREATHING TEST, VALSALVA MANOUEVER), SYMPATHETIC REACTIVITY (HAND GRIP TEST, COLD PRESSURE TEST), AND PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS FVC, FEV1, PEFR, PIF, BHT AND CE WERE RECORDED BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA TRAINING. THE RESTING HEART RATE AFTER YOGA TRAINING (P < 0.05) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED (89.55 +/- 18.46/MIN TO 76.22 +/- 16.44/MIN). THE SYMPATHETIC REACTIVITY WAS REDUCED FOLLOWING YOGA TRAINING AS INDICATED BY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.01) REDUCTION IN DBP AFTER HGT. THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN PARASYMPATHETIC REACTIVITY. THE FVC, FEV1, PEFR DID NOT SHOW ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. THE PIF (P < 0.01), BHT (P < 0.01) AND CE (P < 0.01) SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. THE RESULTS CLOSELY INDICATED THE REDUCTION IN SYMPATHETIC REACTIVITY AND IMPROVEMENT IN THE PULMONARY VENTILATION BY WAY OF RELAXATION OF VOLUNTARY INSPIRATORY AND EXPIRATORY MUSCLES. THE "COMPREHENSIVE YOGIC LIFE STYLE CHANGE PROGRAMME FOR PATIENTS OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA" HAVE SHOWN SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT EVEN WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD.	1996	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
19  712 20 EFFECT OF INTEGRATED YOGA ON ANTI-PSYCHOTIC INDUCED SIDE EFFECTS AND COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM SCHIZOPHRENIA. BACKGROUND TWENTY ONE (12 FEMALES) SUBJECTS, DIAGNOSED WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA BY A PSYCHIATRIST USING ICD-10, IN THE AGES 52.87 + 9.5YEARS AND SUFFERING SINCE 24.0 +/- 3.05YEARS WERE RECRUITED INTO THE STUDY FROM A SCHIZOPHRENIA REHABILITATION CENTER IN BENGALURU. METHODS ALL SUBJECTS WERE TAKING ANTI-PSYCHOTIC MEDICATIONS AND WERE IN STABLE STATE FOR MORE THAN A MONTH. PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATIONS WERE KEPT CONSTANT DURING THE STUDY PERIOD. ASSESSMENTS WERE DONE AT THREE POINTS OF TIME: (1) BASELINE, (2) AFTER ONE MONTH OF USUAL ROUTINE (PRE) AND (3) AFTER FIVE MONTHS OF VALIDATED INTEGRATED YOGA (IY) INTERVENTION (POST). VALIDATED 1H YOGA MODULE (CONSISTING OF ASANAS, PRANAYAMA, RELAXATION TECHNIQUES AND CHANTINGS) WAS PRACTICED FOR 5MONTHS, FIVE SESSIONS PER WEEK. ANTIPSYCHOTIC-INDUCED SIDE EFFECTS WERE ASSESSED USING SIMPSON ANGUS SCALE (SAS) AND UDVALG FOR KLINISKE UNDERSOGELSER (UKU) SIDE EFFECT RATING SCALE. COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS (USING TRAIL MAKING TEST A AND B), CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND ANTHROPOMETRY WERE ASSESSED AS SECONDARY VARIABLES. COMPARISONS BETWEEN "PRE" AND "POST" DATA WAS DONE USING PAIRED SAMPLES T-TESTS AFTER SUBTRACTING BASELINE SCORES FROM THEM RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS AT THE END OF FIVE MONTHS, SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DRUG-INDUCED PARKINSONIAN SYMPTOMS (SAS SCORE; P=0.001) AND 38 ITEMS OF UKU SCALE WAS OBSERVED ALONG WITH SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PROCESSING SPEED, EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS AND NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA PATIENTS. NO SIDE EFFECTS OF YOGA WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS THE PRESENT STUDY PROVIDES PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE FOR USEFULNESS OF INTEGRATED YOGA INTERVENTION IN MANAGING ANTI-PSYCHOTIC-INDUCED SIDE EFFECTS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
20 1131 22 EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR MENTAL PERFORMANCE IN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. BACKGROUND: WITH GROWING SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE, YOGA IS EMERGING AS AN IMPORTANT HEALTH BEHAVIOR-LIFESTYLE MODIFYING MODULE TO ACHIEVE HOLISTIC HEALTH AT PHYSICAL, MENTAL, EMOTIONAL, SOCIAL AND SPIRITUAL LEVELS. BRAIN WAVE COHERENCE (BWC) RECORDINGS FROM THE SURFACE OF THE SKULL ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT COGNITIVE PROCESSES AND PLAYS BOTH CRITICAL AND USEFUL ROLES IN YOGA WITH WIDE RANGE OF FUNCTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE. THE PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES THAT CHARACTERIZE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR BETTER MENTAL PERFORMANCE IN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS HAVE NOT BEEN STUDIED ADEQUATELY. OBJECTIVE: THE STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO ASSESS THE MENTAL PERFORMANCE THROUGH BWC ANALYSIS IN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS UNDERGOING INTEGRATED YOGA MODULE (IYM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE IYM SUBJECTS (N=30) WITH 25.77+/-4.85 YEARS OF MEAN AGE PARTICIPATED IN THIS SINGLE GROUP PRE-POST STUDY. THE BWC DATA WAS COLLECTED BEFORE (PRE) AND AFTER (POST) THE 21 DAYS IYM USING BRAIN MASTER (MODEL: 2E PART # 390-001), MICHIGAN, USA. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: MEANS, STANDARD DEVIATIONS, KOLMOGOROV-SMIRNOV TEST AND WILCOXON SIGNED RANK TEST WERE USED FOR ANALYZING DATA WITH THE HELP OF SPSS-16. RESULTS: A COMPLETE STATISTICAL AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS SHOWED 43.24% INCREASE (P<0.001) IN DELTA, 9.13% INCREASE (P=0.289) IN THETA, 57.85% INCREASE (P<0.001) IN ALPHA, 17.65% DECREASE (P=0.136) IN BETA AND 9.19% INCREASE (P=0.586) IN GAMMA BWC BETWEEN PRE AND POST INTERVENTION MEASUREMENTS. CONCLUSION: BWC STUDY SHOWED SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN BOTH DELTA AND ALPHA WAVE COHERENCE SUGGESTING THAT IYM CAN RESULT IN IMPROVEMENT OF COHERENT AND INTEGRATED BRAIN FUNCTIONING AMONG STUDENTS, THUS PAVING THE WAY FOR THEIR BETTER MENTAL PERFORMANCE. ALTHOUGH THIS PRELIMINARY RESEARCH IS PROMISING, MORE WELL-DESIGNED STUDIES ARE NEEDED BEFORE A STRONG RECOMMENDATION CAN BE MADE.	2013

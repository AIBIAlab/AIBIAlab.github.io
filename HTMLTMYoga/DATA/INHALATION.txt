1 2565 168 YOGA FOR CORRECTION OF LYMPHEDEMA'S IMPAIRMENT OF GAIT AS AN ADJUNCT TO LYMPHATIC DRAINAGE: A PILOT OBSERVATIONAL STUDY. INTRODUCTION: YOGA USED AS A MAJOR COMPONENT OF INTEGRATIVE TREATMENT PROTOCOL IN 14 INDIAN VILLAGE CAMPS IMPROVED QUALITY-OF-LIFE IN 425 LYMPHATIC FILARIASIS PATIENTS. THEY EXPERIENCED BETTER MOBILITY AND REDUCED DISABILITY. THIS PAPER DOCUMENTS THE GAIT ABNORMALITIES OBSERVED IN LOWER LIMB LYMPHEDEMA PATIENTS AND THE LOCOMOTOR CHANGES FOLLOWING INTEGRATIVE TREATMENT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: YOGA POSTURES WERE PERFORMED AS EXPLAINED BY TRADITIONAL YOGA PRACTICE IN TWO SESSIONS: BEFORE AYURVEDIC OIL MASSAGE WITHOUT COMPRESSION BANDAGES AND AFTER THE MASSAGE WITH COMPRESSION BANDAGES. EACH YOGA POSTURE LASTED FOR 5 MIN AND THE WHOLE SESSION ENDED IN 45 MIN. THROUGHOUT EACH SESSION, WE ADVISED PATIENTS TO DO LONG, DIAPHRAGMATIC BREATHING, CONCENTRATING ON EACH BREATH. THE FLEXION OF JOINTS WAS COORDINATED WITH EXHALATION AND EXTENSION WITH INHALATION. WE EDUCATED THE PATIENTS TO DO LONGER EXPIRATION THAN INSPIRATION. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A TOTAL OF 98 PATIENTS (133 LIMBS) ATTENDING THE 6(TH) MONTH FOLLOW-UP WERE EVALUATED. THE MOST COMMON GAIT ABNORMALITY WAS ANTALGIC GAIT. STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL ABNORMALITIES WERE OBSERVED IN HIP, KNEE AND ANKLE JOINTS. WE FOUND THAT YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT TO OTHER COMPONENTS IN INTEGRATIVE TREATMENT IMPROVED THE GAIT PROBLEMS. LONG STANDING LYMPHEDEMA CAUSED ALTERED GAIT AND JOINT DEFORMITIES. THIS WAS MOSTLY DUE TO INACTIVITY CAUSING MUSCLE WEAKNESS AND EDEMA WITHIN AND AROUND THE MUSCLES. BOTH LARGE AND SMALL LIMBS HAVE SHOWN SIGNIFICANT VOLUME REDUCTION (P < 0.01) DURING FOLLOW-UP AFTER 6 MONTHS. CONCLUSION: THERE CAN BE A MIXED ETIOLOGY FOR GAIT RELATED PROBLEMS IN LYMPHEDEMA PATIENTS. FURTHER STUDIES ARE RECOMMENDED TO UNDERSTAND THE CAUSES OF DEFORMITIES IN LYMPHEDEMA PATIENTS AND AN EXACT ROLE OF YOGA.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
2 2766  63 YOGA PROTOCOL FOR TREATMENT OF BREAST CANCER-RELATED LYMPHEDEMA. INTRODUCTION: VAQAS AND RYAN (2003) ADVOCATED YOGA AND BREATHING EXERCISES FOR LYMPHEDEMA. NARAHARI ET AL. (2007) DEVELOPED AN INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE PROTOCOL FOR LOWER-LIMB LYMPHEDEMA USING YOGA. STUDIES HAVE HYPOTHESIZED THAT YOGA PLAYS A SIMILAR ROLE AS THAT OF CENTRAL MANUAL LYMPH DRAINAGE OF FOLDI'S TECHNIQUE. THIS STUDY EXPLAINS HOW WE HAVE USED YOGA AND BREATHING AS A SELF-CARE INTERVENTION FOR BREAST CANCER-RELATED LYMPHEDEMA (BCRL). METHODS: THE STUDY OUTCOME WAS TO CREATE A YOGA PROTOCOL FOR BCRL. SELECTION OF YOGA WAS BASED ON THE ACTIONS OF MUSCLES ON JOINTS, ANATOMICAL AREAS ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT GROUPS OF LYMPH NODES, STRETCHING OF SKIN, AND METHOD OF BREATHING IN EACH YOGA. THE PROTOCOL WAS PILOTED IN EIGHT BCRL PATIENTS, OBSERVED ITS DIFFICULTIES BY INTERACTING WITH PATIENTS. A LITERATURE SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED IN PUBMED AND COCHRANE LIBRARY TO IDENTIFY THE YOGA PROTOCOLS FOR BCRL. RESULTS: TWENTY YOGA AND 5 BREATHING EXERCISES WERE ADOPTED. THEY HAVE SLOW, METHODICAL JOINT MOVEMENTS WHICH HELPED PATIENTS TO TOLERATE PAIN. BREATHING WAS LONG AND DIAPHRAGMATIC. FLEXION OF JOINTS WAS COORDINATED WITH EXHALATION AND EXTENSION WITH INHALATION. ALTERNATE YOGA WAS INTRODUCED TO FACILITATE PATIENTS TO PERFORM COMPLEX MOVEMENTS. YOGA'S JOINT MOVEMENTS, INITIAL POSITIONS, AND MODE OF BREATHING WERE COMPARED TO TWO OTHER PROTOCOLS. THE VOLUME REDUCED FROM 2.4 TO 1.2 L IN EIGHT PATIENTS AFTER CONTINUOUS PRACTICE OF YOGA AND COMPRESSION AT HOME FOR 3 MONTHS. THERE WAS IMPROVEMENT IN THE RANGE OF MOVEMENT AND INTENSITY OF PAIN. DISCUSSION: YOGA EXERCISES WERE SELECTED ON THE BASIS OF THEIR ROLE IN CHEST EXPANSION, MAXIMIZING RANGE OF MOVEMENTS: FLEXION OF LARGE MUSCLES, MAXIMUM STRETCH OF SKIN, AND THUS PART-BY-PART LYMPH DRAINAGE FROM CENTER AND PERIPHERY. THIS PROTOCOL ADDRESSED FUNCTIONAL, VOLUME, AND MOVEMENT ISSUES OF BCRL AND WAS FOUND TO BE SUPERIOR TO OTHER BCRL YOGA PROTOCOLS. HOWEVER, THIS PROTOCOL NEEDS TO BE TESTED IN CENTERS ROUTINELY MANAGING BCRL.	2016	
                                                                                          
3  321  29 ANALOGY BETWEEN CLASSICAL YOGA/ZEN BREATHING AND MODERN CLINICAL RESPIRATORY THERAPY. ANESTHESIOLOGISTS AND INTENSIVISTS ARE MODERN-DAY PROFESSIONALS WHO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE RESPIRATORY CARE, VITAL FOR PATIENT SURVIVAL. RECENTLY, ANESTHESIOLOGISTS HAVE INCREASINGLY FOCUSED THEIR ATTENTION ON THE TYPE OF SPONTANEOUS BREATHING MADE BY NON-INTUBATED PATIENTS WITH PULMONARY DISEASE CARED FOR IN AN INTENSIVE CARE UNIT, AND ALSO PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC PAIN RECEIVING COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY. PRIOR TO OUR MODERN UNDERSTANDING OF RESPIRATORY PHYSIOLOGY, ZEN MEDITATORS RECOGNIZED THAT BREATHING HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON A PERSON'S MENTAL STATE AND GENERAL PHYSICAL WELL-BEING. EXAMPLES OF THIS KNOWLEDGE REGARDING RESPIRATION INCLUDE THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF DEEP INHALATION AND SLOW EXHALATION ON ANXIETY AND GENERAL WELLNESS. THE CLASSICAL LITERATURE HAS NOTED MANY SUGGESTIONS FOR BREATHING AND ITS PSYCHO-PHYSICAL EFFECTS. IN THE PRESENT REVIEW, WE EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF CLASSICAL BREATHING METHODS AND FIND AN ANALOGY BETWEEN TYPICAL YOGA/ZEN BREATHING AND MODERN CLINICAL RESPIRATORY THERAPY. EVIDENCE IS INCREASING ABOUT HISTORICAL BREATHING AND RELATED MEDITATION TECHNIQUES THAT MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN MODERN CLINICAL PRACTICE, ESPECIALLY IN THE FIELD OF ANESTHESIOLOGY, SUCH AS IN IMPROVING RESPIRATORY FUNCTION AND REDUCING CHRONIC PAIN. CLARIFICATION OF THE DETAILED MECHANISMS INVOLVED IS ANTICIPATED.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
4 1401  46 IMPACT OF YOGA ON BIOCHEMICAL PROFILE OF ASTHMATICS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. BACKGROUND: ASTHMA IS A CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY DISORDER OF THE AIRWAYS. THE CHRONIC INFLAMMATION CAUSES AN ASSOCIATED INCREASE IN AIRWAY HYPERRESPONSIVENESS THAT LEADS TO RECURRENT EPISODES OF WHEEZING, BREATHLESSNESS, CHEST TIGHTNESS, AND COUGHING AT NIGHT OR IN THE EARLY MORNING. MOST OF THE STUDIES HAVE REPORTED, AS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON BRONCHIAL ASTHMA, SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN PULMONARY FUNCTIONS, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND DECREASE IN MEDICATION USE, BUT NONE OF THE STUDIES HAS ATTEMPTED TO SHOW THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON BIOCHEMICAL CHANGES. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON BIOCHEMICAL PROFILE OF ASTHMATICS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IN THE PRESENT STUDY, 276 PATIENTS OF MILD TO MODERATE ASTHMA (FEV 1> 60%) AGED BETWEEN 12 TO 60 YEARS WERE RECRUITED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PULMONARY MEDICINE, KING GEORGE'S MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, U.P., LUCKNOW, INDIA. THEY WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: YOGA GROUP (WITH STANDARD MEDICAL TREATMENT AND YOGIC INTERVENTION) AND CONTROL GROUP AS STANDARD MEDICAL TREATMENT (WITHOUT YOGIC INTERVENTION). AT COMPLETION OF 6 MONTHS OF THE STUDY PERIOD, 35 SUBJECTS WERE DROPPED OUT, SO OUT OF 276 SUBJECTS, ONLY 241 SUBJECTS COMPLETED THE WHOLE STUDY (121 SUBJECTS FROM YOGA GROUP AND 120 SUBJECTS FROM CONTROL GROUP). BIOCHEMICAL ASSESSMENT WAS CARRIED OUT AT BASELINE AND AFTER 6 MONTHS OF THE STUDY PERIOD. RESULTS: IN YOGA GROUP, THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT FOUND IN THE PROPORTION OF HEMOGLOBIN AND ANTIOXIDANT SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE IN COMPARISON TO CONTROL GROUP AND SIGNIFICANT DECREASE WAS FOUND IN TOTAL LEUKOCYTE COUNT (TLC) AND DIFFERENTIAL LEUKOCYTES COUNT IN COMPARISON TO CONTROL GROUP. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE FOUND IN TLC, POLYMORPHS, AND MONOCYTES IN BETWEEN GROUP COMPARISON. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA GROUP GOT SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER IMPROVEMENT IN BIOCHEMICAL VARIABLES THAN CONTROL GROUP. RESULT SHOWS THAT YOGA CAN BE PRACTICED AS ADJUVANT THERAPY WITH STANDARD INHALATION THERAPY FOR BETTER OUTCOME OF ASTHMA.	2014	
                                                                                    
5 2137  31 THE EFFECTS OF ACUTE YOGA ON ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IN RESPONSE TO A CARBON DIOXIDE INHALATION TASK IN WOMEN. PURPOSE: WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR IMPROVING COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL ANXIETY SYMPTOMS, AND ITS POSSIBLE RESPIRATORY MECHANISM, IN HIGH-ANXIOUS WOMEN. METHODS: EIGHTEEN PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED 40MIN OF GUIDED YOGA AND A LIGHT STRETCHING PROTOCOL IN A RANDOMIZED, COUNTERBALANCED ORDER.THE 7.5%CO2-INHALATION TASK WAS ADMINISTERED BEFORE, IMMEDIATELY AFTER AND 1H AFTER THE EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS.STATE ANXIETY AND PANIC WERE MEASURED BEFORE AND AFTER EACH INHALATION TASK.TIDAL VOLUME, VENTILATION AND RESPIRATORY RATE WERE MEASURED DURING EVERY 7.5%CO2-INHALATION TASKS. RESULTS: THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT 3-WAY INTERACTION(P>.05).THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT MAIN EFFECT OF CO2-INHALATION TASK ON PANIC AND RESPIRATORY MEASURES(P<.05).WHEN COLLAPSED OVER INHALATION TASK AND CONDITION, THERE WAS A SMALL REDUCTION IN COGNITIVE ANXIETY FROM BASELINE TO IMMEDIATELY POST AND 1-H POST-CONDITION(P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: THERE APPEARS TO BE AN OVERALL EFFECT OF GENERAL PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOR ATTENUATING ANXIETY COGNITIONS IRRESPECTIVE OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES, INDICATING POSSIBLE DISSOCIATION BETWEEN THE COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AMONG WOMEN WITH ANXIETY SENSITIVITY.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
6 1295  41 GUIDELINES FOR TEACHING YOGA TO WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER-RELATED LYMPHOEDEMA: AN EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH. BREAST CANCER-RELATED LYMPHOEDEMA (BCRL) IS A CHRONIC CONDITION THAT REQUIRES LIFELONG MANAGEMENT TO PREVENT THE CONDITION WORSENING AND TO REDUCE THE THREAT OF INFECTION. WOMEN ARE AFFECTED IN ALL DOMAINS OF THEIR LIFE. AS A HOLISTIC PRACTICE, YOGA MAY BE OF BENEFIT BY REDUCING BOTH THE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL EFFECTS OF LYMPHOEDEMA. WOMEN WITH BCRL ARE ATTENDING YOGA CLASSES IN INCREASING NUMBERS, SO IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT YOGA BE BASED ON PRINCIPLES THAT ENSURE LYMPHOEDEMA IS CONTROLLED AND NOT EXACERBATED. TWO RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS WITH A YOGA INTERVENTION HAVE HAD POSITIVE RESULTS AFTER AN 8-WEEK INTERVENTION (N=28) AND 6-MONTHS AFTER A 4-WEEK INTERVENTION (N=18). THE FIRST STUDY HAD SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT RESULTS AND WOMEN REPORTED INCREASED BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL IMPROVEMENTS. BOTH STUDIES SHOWED TRENDS TO IMPROVED LYMPHOEDEMA STATUS. THE YOGA INTERVENTIONS COMPROMISED BREATHING, PHYSICAL POSTURES, MEDITATION AND RELAXATION PRACTICES BASED ON SATYANANDA YOGA(R), WITH MODIFICATIONS TO PROMOTE LYMPHATIC DRAINAGE AND FOLLOWING PRINCIPLES OF BEST CURRENT CARE FOR THOSE WITH BCRL. INDIVIDUAL NEEDS WERE CONSIDERED. THE YOGA PROTOCOL THAT WAS USED IN THE 8-WEEK TRIAL IS PRESENTED. OUR AIM IS TO PROVIDE PRINCIPLES FOR YOGA TEACHERS/THERAPISTS WORKING WITH THIS CLIENTELE THAT CAN BE ADAPTED TO OTHER YOGA STYLES. FURTHER, THESE PRINCIPLES MAY PROVIDE A BASIS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOGA PROGRAMS FOR PEOPLE WITH SECONDARY LYMPHOEDEMA IN OTHER AREAS OF THEIR BODY AS THE POPULATION REQUIRING CANCER TREATMENT CONTINUES TO INCREASE. WHILST THE STYLE OF YOGA PRESENTED HERE HAS HAD POSITIVE OUTCOMES, FURTHER APPLICATION AND RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO FULLY DEMONSTRATE ITS EFFECTIVENESS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
7 2157  33 THE EFFECTS OF UPPER LIMB EXERCISE THROUGH YOGA ON LIMB SWELLING IN CHINESE BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS - A PILOT STUDY. PURPOSE: BREAST CANCER IS THE MOST COMMON FEMALE CANCER. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON LYMPHEDEMA IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. DESIGN: REPEATED MEASURES BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION. WE ENROLLED 15 WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER WHO HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY WORN ELASTIC CLOTHING TO TREAT LYMPHEDEMA. METHODS: THE PROGRAM WAS LED BY A CERTIFIED TRAINER AND CONSISTED OF 60-MINUTE SESSIONS, THREE TIMES A WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS. THE VOLUMES OF THE AFFECTED AND NORMAL LIMBS WERE MEASURED. A SELF-ASSESSED EDEMA SCORE WAS ALSO RECORDED. FINDINGS: FIFTEEN PATIENTS COMPLETED THE PROGRAM, NONE OF WHOM SUFFERED FROM COMPLICATIONS RELATED TO EXERCISE. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT EDEMA AFTER EXERCISE. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE NOTED IN SUBGROUP ANALYSIS BY AGE OR THE AFFECTED ARM. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA DOES NOT INDUCE LYMPHEDEMA. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: LYMPHEDEMA IS USUALLY TREATED WITH UNCOMFORTABLE ELASTIC CLOTHING, AND HIGH-RESISTANCE EXERCISE MAY INDUCE EDEMA. YOGA MAY BE SUITABLE FOR THESE PATIENTS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
8  351  36 ASSESSMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE IN ASTHMA PATIENTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. BACKGROUND: ASTHMA IS A CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY RESPIRATORY DISEASE CHARACTERIZED BY PERIODIC ATTACKS OF WHEEZING, SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND A TIGHT FEELING IN THE CHEST. THE CURRENT STUDY IS BASED ON THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE IN ASTHMATICS IN NORTHERN INDIA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 300 PARTICIPANTS OF MILD-TO-MODERATE PERSISTENT ASTHMA (FEV1 >60%) AGED BETWEEN 12 AND 60 YEARS WERE RECRUITED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PULMONARY MEDICINE. THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE WAS ASSESSED WITH THE HELP OF MINI ASTHMA QUALITY-OF-LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE (AQLQ) AT BASELINE AND THEN AFTER 3(RD) AND 6(TH) MONTH FROM BASELINE. FORTY-FIVE PARTICIPANTS WERE DROPPED OUT DURING THE STUDY WHILE 255 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE STUDY SUCCESSFULLY. RESULTS: IN "THE YOGA GROUP," SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE FOUND IN ALL THE SUBDOMAINS OF AQLQ AT 3(RD) MONTH AND AT 6(TH) MONTH IN COMPARISON TO "THE CONTROL GROUP." THE NUMBER NEEDED TO TREAT WAS FOUND TO BE 2.67 FOR THE TOTAL AQLQ SCORE WHICH WAS GREATER THAN THE MINIMAL IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE. CONCLUSION: "THE YOGA GROUP" GOT SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER IMPROVEMENT IN ASTHMA QUALITY-OF-LIFE SCORES THAN "THE CONTROL GROUP." THUS, YOGA CAN BE USED AS AN ADJUVANT THERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ASTHMA.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
9 1347  32 HYPOXIA IN CNS PATHOLOGIES: EMERGING ROLE OF MIRNA-BASED NEUROTHERAPEUTICS AND YOGA BASED ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES. CELLULAR RESPIRATION IS A VITAL PROCESS FOR THE EXISTENCE OF LIFE. ANY CONDITION THAT RESULTS IN DEPRIVATION OF OXYGEN (ALSO TERMED AS HYPOXIA) MAY EVENTUALLY LEAD TO DELETERIOUS EFFECTS ON THE FUNCTIONING OF TISSUES. BRAIN BEING THE HIGHEST CONSUMER OF OXYGEN IS PRONE TO INCREASED RISK OF HYPOXIA-INDUCED NEUROLOGICAL INSULTS. THIS IN TURN HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH MANY DISEASES OF CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (CNS) SUCH AS STROKE, ALZHEIMER'S, ENCEPHALOPATHY ETC. ALTHOUGH SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS UNDERLYING ISCHEMIC/HYPOXIC CNS DISEASES, THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT PROTECTIVE THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES TO AMELIORATE THE AFFECTED NEURONAL CELLS IS MEAGER. THIS HAS AUGMENTED THE NEED TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE HYPOXIC AND ISCHEMIC EVENTS OCCURRING IN THE BRAIN AND IDENTIFY NOVEL AND ALTERNATE TREATMENT MODALITIES FOR SUCH INSULTS. MICRORNA (MIRNAS), SMALL NON-CODING RNA MOLECULES, HAVE RECENTLY EMERGED AS POTENTIAL NEUROPROTECTIVE AGENTS AS WELL AS TARGETS, UNDER HYPOXIC CONDITIONS. THESE 18-22 NUCLEOTIDE LONG RNA MOLECULES ARE PROFUSELY PRESENT IN BRAIN AND OTHER ORGANS AND FUNCTION AS GENE REGULATORS BY CLEAVING AND SILENCING THE GENE EXPRESSION. IN BRAIN, THESE ARE KNOWN TO BE INVOLVED IN NEURONAL DIFFERENTIATION AND PLASTICITY. THEREFORE, TARGETING MIRNA EXPRESSION REPRESENTS A NOVEL THERAPEUTIC APPROACH TO INTERCEDE AGAINST HYPOXIC AND ISCHEMIC BRAIN INJURY. IN THE FIRST PART OF THIS REVIEW, WE WILL DISCUSS THE NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES CAUSED AS A RESULT OF HYPOXIA, FOLLOWED BY THE CONTRIBUTION OF HYPOXIA IN THE NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES. SECONDLY, WE WILL PROVIDE RECENT UPDATES AND INSIGHTS INTO THE ROLES OF MIRNA IN THE REGULATION OF GENES IN OXYGEN AND GLUCOSE DEPRIVED BRAIN IN ASSOCIATION WITH CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS AND HOW THESE CAN BE TARGETED AS NEUROPROTECTIVE AGENTS FOR CNS INJURIES. FINALLY, WE WILL EMPHASIZE ON ALTERNATE BREATHING OR YOGIC INTERVENTIONS TO OVERCOME THE HYPOXIA ASSOCIATED ANOMALIES THAT COULD ULTIMATELY LEAD TO IMPROVEMENT IN CEREBRAL PERFUSION.	2017	

10  366  24 ASTHMA: THE YOGA PERSPECTIVE. PART I. THE SOMATOPSYCHIC IMBALANCE IN ASTHMA: TOWARDS A HOLISTIC THERAPY. WHILE THE STANDARD PHYSIOLOGICAL AND EVEN CERTAIN PSYCHOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF ASTHMATIC PATIENTS ARE WELL KNOWN, THE CURRENT DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC APPROACH TO ASTHMA REMAINS INADEQUATE, AS IT NEGLECTS CERTAIN INTERRELATED SOMATOPSYCHIC FACTORS VITAL TO AN OPTIMAL DIAGNOSTIC-THERAPEUTIC PROGRAMME. THESE INCLUDE THE ROLE OF SKELETAL MUSCLE TENSION AND POSTURE, THE ROLE OF THE 'VOLUNTARY' RESPIRATORY MUSCULATURE, ESPECIALLY THE DIAPHRAGM, AS WELL AS ANXIETY, EMOTIONAL SUPPRESSION AND EXCESSIVE SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS, ALL OF WHICH MAY BE PRECIPITANTS RATHER THAN THE OUTCOME OF THE ONSET OF ASTHMA. ON THE BASIS OF THESE NEGLECTED FACTORS AND OTHERS, IMPLICATIONS FOR AN OPTIMALLY EFFECTIVE THERAPY ARE DISCUSSED. THE PHYSICAL MEDICINE OR PHYSIOTHERAPEUTIC, AS WELL AS OTHER RECENT THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES, ARE REVIEWED AND EVALUATED. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT ALL OF THESE THERAPIES ARE TOO "SPECIFIC," AND THAT A MORE HOLISTIC APPROACH IS NECESSARY (WHICH IS PROVIDED IN 'ASTHMA: THE YOGA PERSPECTIVE,' PART II-"YOGA THERAPY IN THE TREATMENT OF ASTHMA").	1980

12 2344  37 USING A STANDARDIZED VINIYOGA PROTOCOL FOR LUNG CANCER SURVIVORS: A PILOT STUDY EXAMINING EFFECTS ON BREATHING EASE. ALTHOUGH LUNG CANCER IS PERCEIVED AS A DIRE DIAGNOSIS, INCREASES IN THE 5-YEAR SURVIVAL RATE OF INDIVIDUALS WITH NON-SMALL CELL LUNG CANCER (NSCLC) HAVE BEEN REPORTED. SURVIVORS, HOWEVER, CONTINUE TO BE EXCESSIVELY BURDENED WITH SYMPTOMS SUCH AS RESPIRATORY DISTRESS WHICH INTERFERE WITH FUNCTIONING AND QUALITY OF LIFE. WHILE EXERCISE AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ARE STRONGLY RECOMMENDED, NSCLC SURVIVORS MAY BE RELUCTANT TO PARTICIPATE DUE TO ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED SHORTNESS OF BREATH EXACERBATED WITH MOVEMENT.THIS QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL, INTERVENTION-ONLY PILOT STUDY AIMED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF AN 8-WEEK STANDARDIZED YOGA PROTOCOL FOR STAGE I-IIIA NSCLC SURVIVORS (N=9). THE PROTOCOL WAS DEVELOPED WITHIN THE VINIYOGA (HATHA) TRADITION WITH RESPIRATORY EXPERTS. BREATHING EASE, DYSPNEA, OXYGEN SATURATION, AND RESPIRATORY FUNCTION WERE EXPLORED IN RELATIONSHIP TO YOGA PRACTICE (45-MINUTE SESSIONS ONCE PER WEEK AND HOME PRACTICE) USING REPEATED-MEASURES ANALYSIS. NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS REPORTING DYSPNEA RANGED FROM 25 TO 50% PRIOR TO PRACTICE WITH NO SIGNIFICANT INCREASE DURING SESSIONS, AND MODERATE DECREASES NOTED AT TIMES. OXYGEN SATURATION REMAINED HIGH AND VITAL SIGNS STABLE; FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1 SECOND (FEV1) VALUES INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE 14-WEEK STUDY PERIOD (P<0.0001). YOGA, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON POSTURES COORDINATED WITH BREATHING AND MEDITATION PRACTICES, OFFERS A POTENTIALLY FEASIBLE AND BENEFICIAL OPTION THAT REQUIRES FURTHER STUDY IN THIS POPULATION.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
13 1537  39 KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS PAIN IN THE ELDERLY CAN BE REDUCED BY MASSAGE THERAPY, YOGA AND TAI CHI: A REVIEW. BACKGROUND AND METHODS: THIS IS A REVIEW OF RECENTLY PUBLISHED RESEARCH, BOTH EMPIRICAL STUDIES AND META-ANALYSES, ON THE EFFECTS OF COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES INCLUDING MASSAGE THERAPY, YOGA AND TAI CHI ON PAIN ASSOCIATED WITH KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS IN THE ELDERLY. RESULTS: THE MASSAGE THERAPY PROTOCOLS HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE IN NOT ONLY REDUCING PAIN BUT ALSO IN INCREASING RANGE OF MOTION, SPECIFICALLY WHEN MODERATE PRESSURE MASSAGE WAS USED AND WHEN BOTH THE QUADRICEPS AND HAMSTRINGS WERE MASSAGED. THE YOGA STUDIES TYPICALLY MEASURED PAIN BY THE WOMAC. MOST OF THOSE STUDIES SHOWED A CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PAIN, ESPECIALLY THE RESEARCH THAT FOCUSED ON POSES (E.G. THE IYENGAR STUDIES) AS OPPOSED TO THOSE THAT HAD INTEGRATED PROTOCOLS (POSES, BREATHING AND MEDITATION EXERCISES). THE TAI CHI STUDIES ALSO ASSESSED PAIN BY SELF-REPORT ON THE WOMAC AND SHOWED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN PAIN. THE TAI CHI STUDIES WERE DIFFICULT TO COMPARE BECAUSE OF THEIR HIGHLY VARIABLE PROTOCOLS IN TERMS OF THE FREQUENCY AND DURATION OF TREATMENT. DISCUSSION: LARGER, RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS ARE NEEDED ON EACH OF THESE THERAPIES USING MORE STANDARDIZED PROTOCOLS AND MORE OBJECTIVE VARIABLES IN ADDITION TO THE SELF-REPORTED WOMAC PAIN SCALE, FOR EXAMPLE, RANGE-OF-MOTION AND OBSERVED RANGE-OF-MOTION PAIN. IN ADDITION, TREATMENT COMPARISON STUDIES SHOULD BE CONDUCTED SO, FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE LOWER-COST YOGA AND TAI CHI WERE AS EFFECTIVE AS MASSAGE THERAPY, THEY MIGHT BE USED IN COMBINATION WITH OR AS SUPPLEMENTAL TO MASSAGE THERAPY. NONETHELESS, THESE THERAPIES ARE AT LEAST REDUCING PAIN IN KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS AND THEY DO NOT SEEM TO HAVE SIDE EFFECTS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
14 1574  32 MANAGING LYMPHEDEMA, INCREASING RANGE OF MOTION, AND QUALITY OF LIFE THROUGH YOGA THERAPY AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. LYMPHEDEMA IS A COMMON COMPLICATION OF BREAST CANCER TREATMENT. YOGA IS A NONCONVENTIONAL AND NONINVASIVE INTERVENTION THAT IS REPORTED TO SHOW BENEFICIAL EFFECTS IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER-RELATED LYMPHEDEMA (BCRL). THIS STUDY ATTEMPTED TO SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEW THE EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY ON MANAGING LYMPHEDEMA, INCREASING THE RANGE OF MOTION (ROM), AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. THE REVIEW SEARCH INCLUDED STUDIES FROM ELECTRONIC BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATABASES, NAMELY MEDLINE (PUBMED), EMBASE, AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR TILL JUNE 2019. STUDIES WHICH ASSESSED THE OUTCOME VARIABLES SUCH AS QOL AND MANAGEMENT OF LYMPHEDEMA OR RELATED PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS AS EFFECT OF YOGA INTERVENTION WERE CONSIDERED FOR REVIEW. TWO AUTHORS INDIVIDUALLY REVIEWED, SELECTED ACCORDING TO COCHRANE GUIDELINES, AND EXTRACTED THE ARTICLES USING COVIDENCE SOFTWARE. SCREENING PROCESS OF THIS REVIEW RESULTED IN A TOTAL OF SEVEN STUDIES. THE DIFFERENT STYLES OF YOGA EMPLOYED IN THE STUDIES WERE IYENGAR YOGA (N = 2), SATYANANDA YOGA (N = 2), HATHA YOGA (N = 2), AND ASHTANGA YOGA (N = 1). THE LENGTH OF INTERVENTION AND POST INTERVENTION ANALYSIS RANGED FROM 8 WEEKS TO 12 MONTHS. FOUR STUDIES INCLUDED HOME PRACTICE SESSIONS. QOL, ROM, AND MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS SHOWED IMPROVEMENT IN ALL THE STUDIES. YOGA COULD BE A SAFE AND FEASIBLE EXERCISE INTERVENTION FOR BCRL PATIENTS. EVIDENCE GENERATED FROM THESE STUDIES WAS OF MODERATE STRENGTH. FURTHER LONG-TERM CLINICAL TRIALS WITH LARGE SAMPLE SIZE ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND STANDARDIZATION OF YOGA INTERVENTION GUIDELINES FOR BCRL PATIENTS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
15 1918  21 ROLE OF YOGA AND MEDITATION AS COMPLIMENTARY THERAPEUTIC REGIME FOR STRESS-RELATED NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS: UTILIZATION OF BRAIN WAVES ACTIVITY AS NOVEL TOOL. DURING RECENT DECADES, STRESS-RELATED NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS SUCH AS ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, CHRONIC TENSION HEADACHE, AND MIGRAINE HAVE ESTABLISHED THEIR STRONGHOLD IN THE LIVES OF A VAST NUMBER OF PEOPLE WORLDWIDE. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THIS GLOBAL PHENOMENON, INTENSIVE STUDIES HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT LEADING TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF DRUGS LIKE ANTI-DEPRESSANTS, ANXIOLYTICS, AND ANALGESICS WHICH ALTHOUGH HELP IN COMBATING THE SYMPTOMS OF SUCH DISORDERS BUT ALSO CREATE LONG-TERM SIDE EFFECTS. THUS, AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO SUCH CLINICAL PRACTICES, VARIOUS COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES SUCH AS YOGA AND MEDITATION HAVE BEEN PROVED TO BE EFFECTIVE IN ALLEVIATING THE CAUSES AND SYMPTOMS OF DIFFERENT NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS. THE ROLE OF ALTERED BRAIN WAVES IN THIS CONTEXT HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AND NEEDS TO BE PURSUED AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. THUS, THE CURRENT STUDY PROVIDES A REVIEW FOCUSED ON DESCRIBING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND MEDITATION ON ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AS WELL AS EXPLORING BRAIN WAVES AS A TOOL FOR ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL OF THESE COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES FOR SUCH DISORDERS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
16  790  37 EFFECT OF YOGA EXERCISE ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND UPPER EXTREMITY VOLUME AMONG WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER RELATED LYMPHEDEMA: A PILOT STUDY. PURPOSE: THIS PILOT STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF AN 8-WEEKS-YOGA INTERVENTION ON QUALITY OF LIFE AND UPPER EXTREMITY EDEMA VOLUME IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER RELATED LYMPHEDEMA. METHODS: THIS WAS A CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH PRE-POST DESIGN. A TOTAL OF 40 WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER RELATED LYMPHEDEMA WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED INTO AN INTERVENTION OR CONTROL GROUPS. THE INTERVENTION GROUP PARTICIPATED IN A YOGA EXERCISE CLASS FOR 8 WEEKS, IN A TWICE A WEEK INSTRUCTOR-LED PRACTICE AND ONCE A WEEK HOME PRACTICE. OUTCOMES WERE EORTC QLQ_C30 TO MEASURE QUALITY OF LIFE, AND WATER DISPLACEMENT VOLUME-METER TO MEASURE UPPER EXTREMITY EDEMA VOLUME. THE OUTCOMES WERE EVALUATED AT BASELINE, 4TH AND 8TH WEEK. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING SPSS. RESULTS: FOUR WEEKS AFTER THE INTERVENTION, A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN THE GROUPS WITH RESPECT TO ROLE FUNCTIONING OF QUALITY OF LIFE (P=0.03). EIGHT WEEKS AFTER THE INTERVENTION, A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN GROUPS CONCERNING PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL FUNCTIONING OF QUALITY OF LIFE (P<0.05). THE CHANGING TREND IN PHYSICAL, ROLE, EMOTIONAL, AND COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING HAD INCREASED, AND IN SOME SCALES SUCH AS FATIGUE, PAIN, INSOMNIA, AND FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES THE SCORES WERE REDUCED IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP. REGARDING EDEMA VOLUME, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND BETWEEN BOTH GROUPS ON THE 4TH AND 8TH WEEK AFTER THE INTERVENTION (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: AS YOGA EXERCISE MIGHT IMPROVE PHYSICAL, ROLE, AND EMOTIONAL FUNCTIONING OF QUALITY OF LIFE AS WELL AS REDUCE FATIGUE, PAIN, AND INSOMNIA, USING THIS INTERVENTION CAN BE SUGGESTED AMONGST WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER RELATED LYMPHEDEMA.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
17 2013  30 SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA: A BREATH OF HOPE DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC. IMPORTANT COUNTER MEASURES TO COMBAT AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE PANDEMIC INCLUDE VACCINATION, ANTIVIRAL THERAPY, AND IMMUNOMODULATION THERAPY. VACCINATIONS ARE DISEASE SPECIFIC AND MOREOVER STRAIN SPECIFIC, SO THE PROTECTION PROVIDED IS ALSO SPECIFIC AND LIMITED. ANTIVIRAL THERAPIES ARE COSTLY AND REQUIRE BULK PRODUCTION OF DRUGS, HENCE GLOBALLY THERE IS AN INCREASED INTEREST TOWARD LOW-RISK, COST-EFFECTIVE COMPLEMENTARY ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, SUCH AS YOGA AND AYURVEDA TO TACKLE THE INFECTIOUS PANDEMIC, CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19). THERE IS CLINICAL EVIDENCE AVAILABLE ON THE POTENTIAL COMPLEMENTARY ROLE OF YOGIC PRACTICES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF NONCOMMUNICABLE AND COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. VARIOUS ONLINE DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR ARTICLES PUBLISHED BETWEEN 2000 AND 2020. DATABASES EXPLORED WERE MEDLINE, EMBASE, INDIAN CITATION INDEX, PSYCINFO, INDEX MEDICUS FOR SOUTH-EAST ASIA REGION, AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR. ALL SEARCH RESULTS WERE SCREENED, AND ARTICLES RELATED TO KEYWORDS SUCH AS COVID-19, YOGA THERAPY, AND SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA (SKY) WERE SELECTED FOR DATA EXTRACTION. QUALITY OF THE STUDIES INCLUDED WAS EVALUATED ON THE BASIS OF THE CONSTRUCT VALIDITY, CONTENT VALIDITY, RELEVANCE, BIAS, CREDIBILITY RELATING TO INFORMATION, AND DATA SOURCES. SKY IS A UNIQUE YOGIC PRACTICE THAT INCLUDES SPECIFIC SEQUENTIAL BREATHING TECHNIQUES. IT BALANCES THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND THUS CAN ALLEVIATE ANXIETY, ROUTINE STRESS, DEPRESSION, STRESS-RELATED MEDICAL DISORDERS, AND POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS. IT POTENTIATES NATURAL HOST IMMUNE DEFENSES THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO TACKLE A PLETHORA OF MICROBIAL INFECTIONS. THIS NARRATIVE REVIEW ARTICLE PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS THAT SKY CAN OFFER TO THE POPULATION AT LARGE DURING THIS COVID-19 PANDEMIC.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
18  322  31 ANKLE MOTION IN COMMON YOGA POSES. BACKGROUND: MOTION OF THE ANKLE IS ESSENTIAL FOR MANY YOGA POSES. AN UNDERSTANDING OF RANGE OF ANKLE MOTION DURING TYPICAL YOGA POSES MAY HELP THE CLINICIAN TO UNDERSTAND EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF PATIENTS WHEN RETURNING FROM ANKLE SURGERY OR INJURY TO YOGA. METHODS: THE BIOMECHANICS OF TWENTY HEALTHY ACTIVE YOGIS WERE COLLECTED DURING SEVEN YOGA POSES THAT ARE COMMON WITHIN THEIR PRACTICES. MOTION CAPTURE AND FORCE PLATES WERE USED TO ASSESS THE RANGE OF MOTION AND JOINT MOMENTS OF THE ANKLE FOR EACH POSE. RESULTS: ALL POSES RESULTED IN PLANTARFLEXION AND EXTERNAL ROTATION MOMENTS AT THE ANKLE JOINTS. JOINT LOADING WAS HIGHEST IN SINGLE LEG POSES. THE ARC OF MOTION USED BY THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS IN THE POSES WAS 29 DEGREES OF SAGITTAL MOTION, 20 DEGREES OF FRONTAL MOTION AND 35 DEGREES OF TRANSVERSE MOTION. DISCUSSION: ANKLE MOTION WAS EVALUATED WHEN HEALTHY YOGIS PERFORM STANDARD POSES. THESE RESULTS MAY HELP IN DISCUSSION WITH PATIENTS REGARDING EXPECTED OUTCOMES AFTER ANKLE INJURY OR SURGERY.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
19 1266  22 FLUID INTELLIGENCE AND BRAIN FUNCTIONAL ORGANIZATION IN AGING YOGA AND MEDITATION PRACTITIONERS. NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE DOCUMENTED THE NORMAL AGE-RELATED DECLINE OF NEURAL STRUCTURE, FUNCTION, AND COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE. PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT MEDITATION MAY REDUCE DECLINE IN SPECIFIC COGNITIVE DOMAINS AND IN BRAIN STRUCTURE. HERE WE EXTENDED THIS RESEARCH BY INVESTIGATING THE RELATION BETWEEN AGE AND FLUID INTELLIGENCE AND RESTING STATE BRAIN FUNCTIONAL NETWORK ARCHITECTURE USING GRAPH THEORY, IN MIDDLE-AGED YOGA AND MEDITATION PRACTITIONERS, AND MATCHED CONTROLS. FLUID INTELLIGENCE DECLINED SLOWER IN YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND MEDITATORS COMBINED THAN IN CONTROLS. RESTING STATE FUNCTIONAL NETWORKS OF YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND MEDITATORS COMBINED WERE MORE INTEGRATED AND MORE RESILIENT TO DAMAGE THAN THOSE OF CONTROLS. FURTHERMORE, MINDFULNESS WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH FLUID INTELLIGENCE, RESILIENCE, AND GLOBAL NETWORK EFFICIENCY. THESE FINDINGS REVEAL THE POSSIBILITY TO INCREASE RESILIENCE AND TO SLOW THE DECLINE OF FLUID INTELLIGENCE AND BRAIN FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE AND SUGGEST THAT MINDFULNESS PLAYS A MECHANISTIC ROLE IN THIS PRESERVATION.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
20 2412  30 YOGA AND ITS IMPACT ON CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY AUTOIMMUNE ARTHRITIS. RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA) IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES, WHICH ADVERSELY AFFECTS THE QUALITY OF LIFE. RA IS A DISEASE OF UNKNOWN ETIOLOGY, HOWEVER, BOTH GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS APPEAR TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE SUSCEPTIBILITY TO THIS DISEASE. THE SEVERITY AND PROGRESSION OF THE DISEASE ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RELEASE OF A HOST OF INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES, CYTOTOXIC AND IMMUNE REGULATORY FACTORS. THE TREATMENTS OF RA ARE PRIMARILY LIMITED TO SYMPTOMATIC ALLEVIATION OF PAIN OR OTHER SYMPTOMS OR TO THE USE OF CYTOTOXIC DRUG TREATMENT IN SEVERE FORMS OF THE DISEASE WHICH IS COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT SIDE EFFECTS. DESPITE LACK OF A CURE, THE DISEASE MAY BE CONTROLLED BY MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS. HOLISTIC TREATMENTS SUCH AS YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE AND REDUCE THE PSYCHO-SOMATIC SYMPTOMS, PAIN PERCEPTION, DISABILITY QUOTIENT, JOINT FLEXIBILITY, RANGE OF MOTION, POSTURE, MUSCLE STRENGTH, COORDINATION, AND DISEASE ACTIVITY. HERE, WE DISCUSS THE FEATURES OF RA AND ADDRESS HOW YOGA CAN BE USED AS A THERAPEUTIC REGIMEN TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF PATIENTS WITH RA.	2021

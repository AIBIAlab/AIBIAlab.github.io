2 1265  8 FLEXIBILITY-NOT JUST FOR YOGA ANYMORE! OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, NUCLEOSIDES HAVE MAINTAINED A PROMINENT ROLE AS ONE OF THE CORNERSTONES OF ANTIVIRAL AND ANTICANCER THERAPEUTICS, AND MANY APPROACHES TO NUCLEOSIDE DRUG DESIGN HAVE BEEN PURSUED. ONE SUCH APPROACH INVOLVES FLEXIBILITY IN THE SUGAR MOIETY OF NUCLEOSIDES, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL ANTI-HIV AND HBV DRUG TENOFOVIR. IN CONTRAST, INTRODUCTION OF FLEXIBILITY TO THE NUCLEOBASE SCAFFOLD HAS ONLY MORE RECENTLY GAINED SIGNIFICANCE WITH THE INVENTION OF OUR FLEXIMERS. THE HISTORY, DEVELOPMENT, AND SOME BIOLOGICAL RELEVANCE FOR THIS INNOVATIVE CLASS OF NUCLEOSIDES ARE DETAILED HEREIN.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
3 1674  9 NURTURING THE FEMALE BODY: NOTIONS OF WELLBEING IN WOMB YOGA. ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES WHICH AIM TO ENHANCE WOMEN'S WELLBEING HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF CONTRIBUTING TO HEALTHIST AND POSTFEMINIST AGENDAS WHICH REST UPON A NEOLIBERAL LOGIC. I CRITICALLY ENGAGE WITH THIS ISSUE HERE THROUGH AN ETHNOGRAPHIC STUDY OF WOMB YOGA, A WOMEN'S ALTERNATIVE THERAPY DEVELOPED IN THE UK. I ARGUE THAT WHILE BEING COMMERCIAL AND EMPHASIZING PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY, WOMB YOGA LARGELY WORKS AGAINST THE CURRENT NEOLIBERAL OPTIMIZATION IDEAL. WOMB YOGA PRACTITIONERS DISMISS GOAL-ORIENTED SELF-MANAGEMENT AND DISCIPLINE, AND AVOID A SIMPLE REPRODUCTION OF GENDER STEREOTYPES BY DEFLECTING CARE AWAY FROM OTHER-DIRECTEDNESS AND OPENING THE INTERPRETATION OF FEMININITY TO THE IMAGINATIVE AND EXPERIENTIAL REALMS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
4 1416 12 IMPORTANCE OF MANAS TATTVA: A SEARCHLIGHT IN YOGA DARSHANA. SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL 'MANAS' HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF CURIOSITY FOR SCHOLARS, SCIENTISTS AND PHILOSOPHERS. THE REASON BEHIND THIS CURIOSITY IS ITS IMPORTANCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MANKIND. HUMAN BEING IS SUPERIOR TO OTHER CREATURES IN THE SERIES OF DEVELOPMENT. THIS SUPREMACY OF MAN REMAINS IN HIS QUALITY TO WORK AFTER THINKING, WHICH IS THE FUNCTION OF 'MANAS'. NO OTHER ANIMAL IS CAPABLE TO THINK LOGICALLY. THIS IS THE ONLY REASON WHICH LEADS THE MANKIND TO THE CREST OF DEVELOPMENT IN EVERY ASPECT. TO HIGHLIGHT THE CONCEPT OF MANAS IN YOGA DARSHANA, INFORMATION EXTRACTED FROM YOGA LITERATURES AND AYURVEDIC SAMHITAS. IN INDIAN CULTURE MIND HAS BEEN DESCRIBED FROM VARIOUS ANGLES. VEDIC, PHILOSOPHICAL AND AYURVEDIC LITERATURES HAVE A VAST AND EXCLUSIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANAS. PHILOSOPHERS EITHER ASTIKA OR NASTIKA HAVE DESCRIBED MANAS SIDDHANTA VIVIDLY. THOUGH MANY KINDS OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINIONS ARE THERE, YOGA DARSHANA ACCEPT THE IMPORTANCE OF MIND IN THE PROCESS OF PERCEPTION AND EVEN FOR THE BIRTH OF ANY INDIVIDUAL.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
5 2809 10 YOGA THERAPY: BUILDING A HOLDING ENVIRONMENT FOR SOMATIC AND PSYCHE CHANGE. DRAWING ON IDEAS FROM D.W. WINNICOTT AND THE WORK OF QUAKER THEOLOGIAN PARKER PALMER, THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE CONCEPT OF A HOLDING ENVIRONMENT, ITS REFINED UNDERSTANDING IN THE LITERATURE OVER THE YEARS, AND HOW IT CAN BE OPTIMALLY USED IN YOGA THERAPY. THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT EFFECTIVELY ESTABLISHING A HOLDING ENVIRONMENT CAN FACILITATE BOTH SOMATIC AND DEEP STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN A CLIENT, FACILITATING HEALING FROM PRIMAL WOUNDING AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL RECONNECTION TO THE TRUE SELF.	2015

IMPORTANT MECHANISTIC QUESTIONS REMAIN UNRESOLVED, HOWEVER, REGARDING HOW GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE BINDING ENABLES RAG GTPASES TO TRANSITION DYNAMICALLY BETWEEN DISTINCT YOGA-LIKE STRUCTURAL POSES THAT CONTROL ACTIVATION STATE. EGRI AND SHEN IDENTIFIED A CRITICAL INTERDOMAIN HYDROGEN BOND WITHIN RAGA AND RAGC THAT STABILIZES THEIR GDP-BOUND STATES. THEY DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS LONG-DISTANCE INTERACTION CONTROLS RAG STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION TO CONFER APPROPRIATE AMINO ACID SENSING BY MECHANISTIC TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN COMPLEX 1.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
7 1614 10 MIND AND CONSCIOUSNESS IN YOGA - VEDANTA: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WITH WESTERN PSYCHOLOGICAL CONCEPTS. STUDY OF MIND AND CONSCIOUSNESS THROUGH ESTABLISHED SCIENTIFIC METHODS IS OFTEN DIFFICULT DUE TO THE OBSERVED-OBSERVER DICHOTOMY. CARTESIAN APPROACH OF DUALISM CONSIDERING THE MIND AND MATTER AS TWO DIVERSE AND UNCONNECTED ENTITIES HAS BEEN QUESTIONED BY ORIENTAL SCHOOLS OF YOGA AND VEDANTA AS WELL AS THE RECENT QUANTUM THEORIES OF MODERN PHYSICS. FREUDIAN AND NEO-FREUDIAN SCHOOLS BASED ON THE CARTESIAN MODEL HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED BY THE HUMANISTIC SCHOOLS WHICH COME MUCH CLOSER TO THE VEDANTIC APPROACH OF UNITARINESS. A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE TWO APPROACHES IS DISCUSSED.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
8  409 10 BLENDING MARTIAL ARTS AND YOGA FOR HEALTH: FROM THE LAST SAMURAI TO THE FIRST ODAKA YOGA WARRIOR. THIS PAPER INTRODUCES THE CASE STUDY OF ODAKA YOGA, AN INNOVATIVE STYLE OF POSTURAL YOGA BLENDED WITH MARTIAL ARTS ELEMENTS WHICH EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF PRACTITIONERS' HEALTH AND PROCESSES OF SELF-TRANSFORMATION AS PIVOTAL TO THE SCHOOL'S ETHOS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE PAPER EXPLORES HOW ODAKA YOGA'S PHILOSOPHICAL BACKDROPS AND PRACTICAL REPERTOIRE, COMPOSED BY A MIXTURE OF "EXOTIC" RESOURCES SUCH AS BUSHIDO, ZEN, YOGA, AND A CONSTANT REFERENCE TO THE OCEAN WAVES AND BIOMECHANICS, CONSTITUTE A VERY SPECIFIC VISION OF HEALTH AT THE INTERSECTION OF WESTERN SCIENCE AND ESOTERIC KNOWLEDGE. THEORETICALLY, THE PAPER BORROWS FROM JENNINGS' THEORY OF MARTIAL CREATION AND ENRICHES IT WITH SOME OF THE CENTRAL ANALYTICAL TOOLS PROPOSED BY THEORISTS SUCH AS BOURDIEU AND FOUCAULT. METHODOLOGICALLY, IT RELIES ON A MULTIMODAL APPROACH INCLUDING DISCURSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE SCHOOL'S PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS, INTERVIEWS WITH THE FOUNDERS AND OTHER KEY TEACHERS, AND OBSERVANT PARTICIPATION OF PRACTITIONERS' APPRENTICESHIP PROCESSES. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE BIRTH OF ODAKA YOGA AS OCCURRING AT THE INTERSECTION OF ASIAN MARTIAL ARTS AND YOGA, AS WELL AS THE FOUNDERS' BIOGRAPHICAL TRAJECTORIES FROM THE WORLD OF COMPETITIVE MARTIAL ARTS AND FITNESS, TO YOGA; IT THEN TURNS TO AN EXAMINATION OF ODAKA YOGA'S CONCEPTION OF HEALTH AS A MIXTURE OF THE WESTERN BIOMEDICAL MODEL AND THE SUBTLE BODY MODEL OF ASIAN TRADITIONS SUCH AS YOGA AND MARTIAL ARTS. IT ARGUES THAT THE CONCEPTION OF HEALTH PROMOTED BY THIS SCHOOL GIVES RISE TO THE ODAKA YOGA WARRIOR, THE IDEAL-TYPICAL PRACTITIONER WHOSE BODY IS SIMULTANEOUSLY EXPOSED TO THE MEDICAL GAZE AND ITS IMPERATIVES OF CONTROL, KNOWLEDGE, AND MANIPULATION; WHILE IT ALSO DEIFIES IT, AS IT IS ANIMATED BY THE ELUSIVE FLOWS OF ENERGY (QI OR PRANA) THAT PROLONGED PRACTICE AIMS TO MASTER. THE PAPER CONCLUDES WITH A REFLECTION ON HYBRID CONCEPTIONS OF HEALTH AND THE UBIQUITOUS ROLE OF HEALTH DISCOURSES AND NARRATIVES ACROSS SOCIOCULTURAL DOMAINS.	2020	

9 2494 10 YOGA AS MEDICINE: UNDERSTANDING BHUTANESE REFUGEE PERSPECTIVES ON HEALTH AND HEALTHCARE. BHUTANESE REFUGEES IN THE U.S. OFTEN STRUGGLE TO ACCESS CULTURALLY COMPETENT HEALTH TREATMENT. ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM REQUIRES UNDERSTANDING HOW REFUGEES PERCEIVE THEIR HEALTH AND HEALTHCARE NEEDS. SINCE 2015, A COMMUNITY AGENCY HAS IMPLEMENTED COMMUNITY-BASED, PEER-LED SUPPORT GROUPS FOR BHUTANESE REFUGEES, WITH 17 GROUPS IN 2018-2019. THIS STUDY DESCRIBES THE AGENCY'S QUALITY ASSURANCE EVALUATION THROUGH GROUP LEADER FEEDBACK, OBSERVATION REPORTS, AND FOCUS GROUPS. THE RESULTS OF 46 QUALITY ASSURANCE DOCUMENTS SHOW THAT THIS GROUP OF BHUTANESE REFUGEES PERCEIVE THEIR HEALTH THROUGH THE MIND-BODY CONNECTION, VIEWING PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH AS LINKED AND SUPPORTED BY YOGA, MINDFULNESS, EXERCISE, NUTRITION, AND CREATIVE EXPRESSION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
10  623  9 DHARMA, YOGA, TANTRA. IN THE MID-20TH CENTURY, SELVARARAJAN YESUDIAN (1916-1998), WHO WAS BORN IN INDIA TO A CHRISTIAN FATHER, A PHYSICIAN, AND SPENT MOST OF HIS LIFE IN SWITZERLAND, COAUTHORED (WITH ELISABETH HAICH) A BOOK ENTITLED YOGA AND HEALTH; SINCE THEN, THE COUPLING OF THESE TWO WORDS HAS LARGELY DEFINED THE MEANING OF YOGA IN THE WEST, ESPECIALLY IN PROMOTIONAL LITERATURE FOR URBAN YOGA SCHOOLS AND HEALTH-CLUB PROGRAMS. AUTHENTIC INDIAN TRADITIONS HAVE INDEED AFFIRMED THE THERAPEUTIC BENEFIT OF YOGA, BUT THEY HAVE CONSISTENTLY SEEN YOGA AS A "THERAPY OF THE SOUL," A WAY OF "QUIETING THE AGITATIONS OF THE HEART," TO THE END OF PERCEIVING THE ULTIMATE WITHIN THE SOUL AND, IN RELIGIOUS TERMS, OF REALIZING UNION WITH GOD. THIS PAPER WILL EXAMINE SOME CLASSICAL YOGA TEXTS IN RELATION TO SPIRITUAL REMEDIES FOR SUBSTANCE MISUSE AND OTHER FORMS OF ADDICTION AND CHEMICAL DEPENDENCY.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
11 1736  8 PHOTO URTICARIA CAUSED BY EXPOSURE TO LED EMITTING 633-NM WAVELENGTH DURING HOT YOGA EXERCISE. PHOTO URTICARIA (PU) IS A RARE TYPE OF URTICARIA THAT DEVELOPS AFTER EXPOSURE TO VARIOUS WAVELENGTHS OF LIGHT. INDUCING URTICARIAL WHEALS USING LIGHT SOURCES OF PERTINENT WAVELENGTHS CAN HELP MAKE THE DEFINITIVE DIAGNOSIS OF PU. THE ACTION SPECTRA (AS) IN JAPANESE PATIENTS WITH PU COMMONLY FALL WITHIN THE ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION A AND VISIBLE LIGHT RANGE. HEREIN, TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, WE PRESENT THE FIRST CASE OF PU CAUSED BY 633-NM WAVELENGTH WITHIN THE VISIBLE LIGHT SPECTRUM. OUR PATIENT WORKED AS A "HOT YOGA" INSTRUCTOR, WHERE LIGHT-EMITTING DIODES (LEDS) ON THE CEILING WERE USED TO IRRADIATE THE ENTIRE ROOM WITH 633-NM WAVELENGTH OF LIGHT FOR "LIGHT TREATMENT." SHE REPORTED ITCHING AND WHEALS ON THE FACE AND NECK DURING HER "HOT YOGA" SESSIONS. "HOT YOGA" HAS RECENTLY GAINED POPULARITY GLOBALLY. THE "LIGHT TREATMENT" IS BASED ON THE THEORY THAT 633-NM WAVELENGTH LIGHT WITHIN THE VISIBLE LIGHT SPECTRUM REPORTEDLY PREVENTS THE SKIN FROM AGING. WE INDUCED WHEALS WITH ERYTHEMA BY IRRADIATING HER SKIN USING A 633-NM LED AT A DOSE OF 0.008 J/CM(2) /S FOR 1 H. HER CONDITION WAS DIAGNOSED AS PU CAUSED BY EXPOSURE TO 633 NM. LIGHT. HER SYMPTOMS HAVE NOT RECURRED SINCE SHE HAS AVOIDED BEING EXPOSED TO THE 633-NM WAVELENGTH OF LED LIGHT.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
12   42  7 A CASE OF RECTUS SHEATH HEMATOMA CAUSED BY YOGA EXERCISE. RECTUS SHEATH HEMATOMA IS A RELATIVELY RARE CONDITION BUT A SIGNIFICANT CAUSE OF ACUTE ABDOMINAL PAIN.

14 1993  7 STANDARDISATION OF KUTAJADI VISHESH YOGA. AMOEBIASIS IS A PROBLEM IN NORTHERN INDIA. IN AYURVEDA SEVERAL HERBAL DRUGS ARE MENTIONED, TO BE USED FOR CONTROLLING THE AMATISARA (AMOEBIASIS) BUT NONE OF THE DRUG ARE FOUND HAVING POTENT EFFECT TO IRADICATE THE DISEASE. IN ANCIENT LITERATURE KUTAJ (HOLARRHENA ANTIDYSENTRICA) IS MENTIONED IN COMMONEST WAS FOR CONTROLLING THE DISEASE THIS PLANT IS PREVALENTLY FOUND IN HIMALAYAN AND VINDHAYA AREA. IT IS VERY EFFECTIVE FOR RELIEVING AMOEBIASIS. BY SEEING ITS THEURAPTIC IMPORTANCE WE HAVE TRIED TO STANDARDIZE THE COMPOUND IN WHOLE WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO KUTAJ. THE DETAIL COMPOSITION AND METHOD OF PREPARATION OF DRUG WITH ITS THERAPEUTIC EFFECT WILL BE NARRATED DURING THE TIME OF WORKSHOP.	1998

16 1819 10 PROTEIN YOGA: CONFORMATIONAL VERSATILITY OF THE HEMOLYSIN II C-TERMINAL DOMAIN DETAILED BY NMR STRUCTURES FOR MULTIPLE STATES. THE C-TERMINAL DOMAIN OF BACILLUS CEREUS HEMOLYSIN II (HLYIIC), STABILIZES THE TRANS-MEMBRANE-PORE FORMED BY THE HLYII TOXIN AND MAY AID IN TARGET CELL RECOGNITION. INITIAL EFFORTS TO DETERMINE THE NMR STRUCTURE OF HLYIIC WERE HAMPERED BY CIS/TRANS ISOMERIZATION ABOUT THE SINGLE PROLINE AT POSITION 405 THAT LEADS TO DOUBLING OF NMR RESONANCES. WE USED THE MUTANT P405M-HLYIIC THAT ELIMINATES THE CIS PROLINE TO DETERMINE THE NMR STRUCTURE OF THE DOMAIN, WHICH REVEALED A NOVEL FOLD. HERE, WE EXTEND EARLIER STUDIES TO THE NMR STRUCTURE DETERMINATION OF THE CIS AND TRANS STATES OF WT-HLYIIC THAT EXIST SIMULTANEOUSLY IN SOLUTION. THE PRIMARY STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CIS AND TRANS STATES ARE IN THE LOOP THAT CONTAINS P405, AND STRUCTURALLY ADJACENT LOOPS. THERMODYNAMIC LINKAGE ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT AT 25 C THE CIS PROLINE, WHICH ALREADY HAS A LARGE FRACTION OF 20% IN THE UNFOLDED PROTEIN, INCREASES TO 50% IN THE FOLDED STATE DUE TO COUPLING WITH THE GLOBAL STABILITY OF THE DOMAIN. THE P405M OR P405A SUBSTITUTIONS ELIMINATE HETEROGENEITY DUE TO PROLINE ISOMERIZATION BUT LEAD TO THE FORMATION OF A NEW DIMERIC SPECIES. THE NMR STRUCTURE OF THE DIMER SHOWS THAT IT IS FORMED THROUGH DOMAIN-SWAPPING OF STRAND BETA5, THE LAST SEGMENT OF SECONDARY STRUCTURE FOLLOWING P405. THE PRESENCE OF P405 IN WT-HLYIIC STRONGLY DISFAVORS THE DIMER COMPARED TO THE P405M-HLYIIC OR P405A-HLYIIC MUTANTS. THE WT PROLINE MAY THUS ACT AS A "GATEKEEPER," WARDING OFF AGGREGATIVE MISFOLDING.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
17  486 11 CLINICAL HYPNOSIS AND PATANJALI YOGA SUTRAS. THE TRANCE STATES IN YOGA AND HYPNOSIS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH SIMILAR PHENOMENA LIKE RELAXATION, DISINCLINATION TO TALK, UNREALITY, MISREPRESENTATION, ALTERATIONS IN PERCEPTION, INCREASED CONCENTRATION, SUSPENSION OF NORMAL REALITY TESTING, AND THE TEMPORARY NATURE OF THE PHENOMENA. WHILE SOME RESEARCHERS CONSIDER YOGA TO BE A FORM OF HYPNOSIS, OTHERS NOTE THAT THERE ARE MANY SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE TRANCE IN YOGA AND THE HYPNOTIC TRANCE. THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO FIND SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE TRANCE STATES OF HYPNOSIS AND PATANJALI'S YOGA SUTRAS. THE TRANCE STATES WERE COMPARED WITH THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE PHENOMENA OF TRANCE, AND THE THERAPEUTIC TECHNIQUES AND BENEFITS OF BOTH. AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONCEPT OF TRANCE IN PATANJALI'S YOGA SUTRAS WAS GAINED THROUGH A THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF THE BOOK FOUR CHAPTERS ON FREEDOM BY SWAMI SATYANANDA SARASWATI. THIS LED TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE CONCEPT OF TRANCE IN THE YOGA SUTRAS. THE OBTAINED CONCEPTS WERE COMPARED TO THE CONCEPTS OF TRANCE IN HYPNOSIS (OBTAINED THROUGH THE LITERATURE ON HYPNOSIS) TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER OR NOT THERE EXIST SIMILARITIES. THE FINDINGS OF THE STUDY SHOW THAT THERE ARE SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE TRANCE IN HYPNOSIS AND THE TRANCE IN PATANJALI'S YOGA SUTRAS IN THE INDUCTION AND DEEPENING OF THE TRANCE STATES IN HYPNOSIS AND THAT OF SAMADHI, THE PHENOMENA PRESENT IN HYPNOSIS AND THE KINDS OF SIDDHIS THAT ARE OBTAINED THROUGH SAMADHI, AND THE THERAPEUTIC TECHNIQUES AND THE THERAPEUTIC PROCESS IN PATANJALI'S YOGA SUTRA AND HYPNOSIS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
18 2694  9 YOGA INDUCED ACUTE ULNAR NERVE COMPRESSION BY A GANGLION CYST IN GUYON'S CANAL. ACUTE ULNAR NEUROPATHY AT THE WRIST CAN BE DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE, AS IT IS AN UNCOMMON NEUROPATHY WITH VARIABLE CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS AND NUMEROUS ETIOLOGIES. WE PRESENT A CASE OF ACUTE ULNAR NEUROPATHY OF THE DEEP MOTOR BRANCH CAUSED BY A GANGLION CYST IN GUYON'S CANAL. INTERESTINGLY, THIS CASE OF ACUTE LOSS OF MOTOR FUNCTION OCCURRED AFTER THE PATIENT PARTICIPATED IN YOGA (SPECIFICALLY THE DOWNWARD DOG POSITION), AND RESOLVED SPONTANEOUSLY OVER TIME AFTER STOPPING YOGA, WITHOUT SURGICAL EXCISION OF THE GANGLION, SUGGESTING EXACERBATION OR PROTRUSION OF AN OCCULT GANGLION CYST DUE TO INCREASED ACTIVITY AND COMPRESSION OF THE HYPOTHENAR EMINENCE.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
19 2500  9 YOGA AS THE "NEXT WAVE" OF THERAPEUTIC MODALITIES FOR TREATMENT OF INSOMNIA. INSOMNIA RATES CONTINUE TO RISE, ESPECIALLY AMONG SPECIFIC POPULATIONS. CURRENT NONPHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENTS RELY PRIMARILY UPON COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR INSOMNIA (CBT-I), WHICH WAS INTRODUCED IN THE 1970S. NEWER TREATMENTS HAVE INCORPORATED CBT "THIRD WAVE" TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING MINDFULNESS AND ACCEPTANCE TECHNIQUES. YOGA PRACTICE IS WELL SUITED TO COMPLEMENT EXISTING THERAPIES AND TO ADDRESS SLEEP PROBLEMS IN A MORE HOLISTIC WAY. CURRENT THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL APPROACHES TO TREATING INSOMNIA ARE DISCUSSED, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON THE ROLE OF YOGA IN ADDRESSING PRECIPITATING AND PERPETUATING FACTORS IN INSOMNIA THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN LARGELY OVERLOOKED.AN ESTIMATED ONE-THIRD OF U.S. ADULTS SUFFER FROM INSOMNIA (CHEN, GELAYE, & WILLIAMS, 2013; MELLINGER, BALTER, & UHLENHUTH, 1985; OHAYON, 2002), AND THE PROBLEM APPEARS TO BE GROWING. WHILE TREATMENT FOR INSOMNIA HAS HELPED TO ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM FOR SOME (IRWIN, COLE, & NICASSIO, 2006; MORIN ET AL., 2009), PREVALENCE OF INSOMNIA IS ON THE RISE, ESPECIALLY AMONG CERTAIN GROUPS, INCLUDING ELDERLY AND MILITARY POPULATIONS (MORIN, 2009; MYSLIWIEC ET AL., 2013). RISING RATES OF INSOMNIA HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO CHANGES IN LIFESTYLE AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, INCLUDING INCREASED RELIANCE ON TECHNOLOGY AND DECREASED SYNCHRONY WITH NATURAL WAKE-SLEEP RHYTHMS (BRAHINSKY, 2013; WALLACE-GUY ET AL., 2002; YUN, BAZAR, GERBER, LEE, & DANIEL, 2005).	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
20 2498  9 YOGA AS SANCTUARY: A VALUABLE MIND-BODY INTERVENTION FOR THE LESBIAN COMMUNITY. POETIC AUTOETHNOGRAPHY PROVIDES A RESEARCH METHODOLOGY TO EXPLORE YOGA AS A MIND-BODY INTERVENTION THAT CREATES SANCTUARY. USING THIS QUALITATIVE METHOD AND RETRIEVING DATA FROM MY PERSONAL JOURNALS, DAILY WORKOUT JOURNALS, EXPERIENCES AS A LESBIAN-IDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT IN YOGA CLASSES, AND YOGA INSTRUCTOR, I TURN THE RESEARCH LENS ON MYSELF IN ORDER TO EXAMINE MY SOCIOLOGICAL LIFE STORY. AT A CRITICAL TIME IN MY LIFE WHEN I WAS STRUGGLING WITH THE FRAGMENTATION, ANXIETY, AND DESPAIR RESULTING FROM DEALING WITH HOMOPHOBIA IN A HETERONORMATIVE WORLD, YOGA PROVIDED SANCTUARY FOR ME. MY YOGA PRACTICE INCREASED MY SELF-EFFICACY, PROVIDING TRANSFERABLE TECHNIQUES FOR FINDING REFUGE WITHIN MYSELF, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE ADVERSITY I WAS FACING IN MY LIFE. PLACES OF SANCTUARY ARE CRITICAL FOR MEMBERS OF MINORITY GROUPS WHO OFTEN FACE MARGINALIZATION AND OPPRESSION, WHICH COMPROMISE THEIR WELL-BEING.	2017

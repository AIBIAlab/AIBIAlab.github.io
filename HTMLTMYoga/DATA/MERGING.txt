1 1607 77 MERGING YOGA AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE: A FEASIBILITY AND PILOT PROGRAM. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS FEASIBILITY AND CHANGES IN OUTCOME MEASURES FOLLOWING THE MERGING YOGA AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE (MY-OT FOR PD) PROGRAM: A 14-SESSION PROGRAM WHICH COMBINED COMMUNITY-BASED YOGA FOR PD, AND FALL-RISK FOCUSED GROUP OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY SESSIONS. SEVENTEEN PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED AN 8-WEEK CONTROL PERIOD CONSISTING OF THEIR NORMAL PARTICIPATION, AND AN 8-WEEK INTERVENTION PERIOD (14 MY-OT FOR PD SESSIONS). THERE WERE FEWER SELF-REPORTED FALLS IN THE INTERVENTION (6) VS. CONTROL PERIODS (10). ONE FALL RISK FACTOR MANAGEMENT SCALE (THE FALL PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT QUESTIONNAIRE, P=.02), AND BALANCE (P<.01) SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT BETWEEN THE CONTROL AND INTERVENTION. THE MY-OT FOR PD PROGRAM IS AN ENCOURAGING OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST-LED PROGRAM, WHICH MAY IMPROVE BALANCE AND REDUCE SELF-REPORTED FALLS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
2 1314 28 HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES AFTER THE MERGING YOGA AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE PROGRAM: A MIXED-METHODS STUDY. BACKGROUND: TO UNDERSTAND CHANGES IN HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) AFTER THE MERGING YOGA AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE (MY-OT FOR PD) PROGRAM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE USED A MIXED-METHODS CONVERGENT DESIGN AND ADMINISTERED THE PARKINSON'S DISEASE QUESTIONNAIRE-8 (PDQ-8), A MEASURE OF HRQOL, WITH 17 PARTICIPANTS. WE CONSIDERED SCORES 8 WEEKS BEFORE MY-OT FOR PD, JUST BEFORE, AND UPON COMPLETION. ADDITIONALLY, WE COMPLETED TWO FOCUS GROUPS FOLLOWING THE PROGRAM WITH 16 PARTICIPANTS TO ASSESS QUALITATIVE CHANGES IN HRQOL. RESULTS: THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN PDQ-8 SCORES BETWEEN TIME POINTS, F(2,32) = 1.60, P = 0.22, PARTIAL ETA(2) = 0.09. PARTICIPANTS DID DISCUSS IMPROVEMENTS IN ALL 8 HRQOL DOMAINS, FREQUENTLY REGARDING MOBILITY AND ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING. CONCLUSION: RESULTS DIVERGED, WITH QUANTITATIVE RESULTS SHOWING NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN HRQOL AND QUALITATIVE RESULTS INDICATING PARTICIPANT PERCEIVED IMPROVEMENTS IN ALL DOMAINS OF THE PDQ-8. THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE EXPLORED FURTHER, AND LONGITUDINAL FOLLOW-UP COMPLETED.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
3   12 43 "MERGING YOGA AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY (MY-OT): A FEASIBILITY AND PILOT STUDY". OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND BENEFITS OF THE MERGING YOGA AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY (MY-OT) INTERVENTION. DESIGN: THIS IS THE PRIMARY ANALYSIS OF A NON-CONTROLLED PRETEST-POSTTEST PILOT STUDY TO UNDERSTAND THE FEASIBILITY AND IMPACT OF MY-OT ON BALANCE, BALANCE SELF-EFFICACY, AND FALL RISK FACTOR MANAGEMENT IN PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC STROKE. SETTING: UNIVERSITY RESEARCH LABORATORY. PARTICIPANTS: PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC STROKE WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY IF THEY: HAD SUSTAINED A FALL OR HAD FEAR OF FALLING, WERE ABLE TO STAND, AND HAND IMPAIRED BALANCE AND WERE AT RISK FOR FALLS (</=46 ON THE BERG BALANCE SCALE (BBS)). INTERVENTIONS: INDIVIDUALS COMPLETED AN 8 WEEK INTERVENTION THAT INCLUDED 16 SESSIONS OF BOTH YOGA AND GROUP OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY (OT). YOGA INCLUDED PHYSICAL POSTURES, BREATHING EXERCISES, AND MEDITATION. OT FOCUSED ON POST-STROKE FALL RISK FACTOR MANAGEMENT. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: THE BBS WAS USED TO ASSESS BALANCE, THE ACTIVITIES-SPECIFIC BALANCE CONFIDENCE SCALE (ABC) WAS USED TO MEASURE BALANCE SELF-EFFICACY. FIVE FALL RISK FACTOR MANAGEMENT SCALES WERE USED. RESULTS: OVERALL, THE INTERVENTION WAS CONSIDERED FEASIBLE, AS INDIVIDUALS WERE ABLE TO SAFELY COMPLETE THE INTERVENTION WITH LITTLE ATTRITION AND HIGH ATTENDANCE. BALANCE IMPROVED BY 30% (P=0.002). BALANCE SELF-EFFICACY IMPROVED BY 15% (P=0.034). EACH OF THE FIVE FALL RISK FACTOR MANAGEMENT SCALES IMPROVED, BUT ONLY TWO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED (FALL PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT QUESTIONNAIRE, 29%, P=0.004 AND FALL PREVENTION STRATEGY SURVEY, 42%, P=0.032). CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT MY-OT IS A POTENTIAL INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE MULTIPLE FALL RELATED OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE WITH STROKE. THERAPISTS MAY CONSIDER THESE INTERVENTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH STROKE, BUT ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS WARRANTED.	2016

6 2180 23 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PATIENTS WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE: A META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. METHODS: A META-ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED BY SYSTEMATICALLY SEARCHING PUBMED, EMBASE, AND COCHRANE LIBRARY DATABASES TILL AUGUST 2020 FOR STUDIES PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH. THE REFERENCE LISTS OF ELIGIBLE STUDIES WERE ALSO SEARCHED. THE MOTOR SYMPTOMS (UPDRS-PART III), BALANCE FUNCTION (BBS AND BESTEST), FUNCTIONAL MOBILITY (TUG), ANXIETY (HADS AND BAI), DEPRESSION (HADS AND BDI), AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE (PDQ-39 AND PDQ-8) WERE THE PRIMARY EVALUATION INDEXES. RESULTS: TEN STUDIES INCLUDING 359 PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED IN THIS META-ANALYSIS. THE POOLED RESULTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE YOGA TRAINING GROUP AND THE CONTROL GROUP. PATIENTS IN THE YOGA TRAINING GROUP HAD BETTER FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES IN TERMS OF MOTOR STATUS (MD = -5.64; 95% CI, -8.57 TO -2.7), BALANCE FUNCTION (SMD = 0.42; 95% CI, 0.08 TO 0.77), FUNCTIONAL MOBILITY (MD = -1.71; 95% CI, -2.58 TO -0.84), ANXIETY SCALE SCORES (SMD = -0.72; 95% CI, -1.01 TO -0.43), DEPRESSION SCALE SCORES (SMD = -0.92; 95% CI, -1.22 TO -0.62), AND QOL (SMD = -0.54; 95% CI, -0.97 TO -0.11). CONCLUSION: OUR POOLED RESULTS SHOWED THE BENEFITS OF YOGA IN IMPROVING MOTOR FUNCTION, BALANCE, FUNCTIONAL MOBILITY, REDUCING ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, AND INCREASING QOL IN PD PATIENTS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
7 2101 28 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON BALANCE AND FEAR OF FALLING IN OLDER ADULTS. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON BALANCE AND FEAR OF FALLING IN OLDER ADULTS. DESIGN: RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: JAHANDIDEGAN CENTER IN SHIRAZ, SOUTHERN IRAN. PARTICIPANTS: FORTY PERSONS (17 MEN AND 23 WOMEN) BETWEEN THE AGES OF 60-74 YEARS WITH A MODIFIED FALLS EFFICACY SCALE (MFES) SCORE <8 AND A BERG BALANCE SCALE (BBS) SCORE <45. AFTER COMPLETING THE MFES QUESTIONNAIRE AND BBS MEASUREMENT, THE PARTICIPANTS WERE DIVIDED INTO INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS. BBS MEASUREMENT AND THE MFES QUESTIONNAIRE WERE COMPLETED AGAIN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE INTERVENTION. INTERVENTION: THE INTERVENTION GROUP PARTICIPATED IN 2 YOGA PRACTICE SESSIONS PER WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS. THE CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED NO INTERVENTION. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: FEAR OF FALLING WAS MEASURED WITH THE MFES AND BALANCE WAS MEASURED WITH THE BBS. RESULTS: WE FOUND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN BOTH VARIABLES (P < .0001). MEAN DIFFERENCES BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION FOR THE BBS FOR YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS WERE 10.19 AND -1.16, RESPECTIVELY. MEAN DIFFERENCES BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION FOR THE MFES FOR YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS WERE 1.62 AND -0.21, RESPECTIVELY. CONCLUSION: YOGA IS A POTENTIAL INTERVENTION TO REDUCE FEAR OF FALLING AND IMPROVE BALANCE IN OLDER ADULTS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
8 2561 21 YOGA FOR CHRONIC NECK PAIN: A 12-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF A 9-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION ON CHRONIC NONSPECIFIC NECK PAIN 12 MONTHS AFTER COMPLETION. DESIGN: TWELVE-MONTH FOLLOW-UP OF THE POOLED DATA OF BOTH ARMS OF A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: DEPARTMENT OF INTERNAL AND INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE AT AN ACADEMIC TEACHING HOSPITAL. SUBJECTS: FIFTY-ONE PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC NONSPECIFIC NECK PAIN (MEAN AGE 47.8 YEARS; 82.4% FEMALE). INTERVENTIONS: A 9-WEEK YOGA GROUP INTERVENTION. OUTCOME MEASURES: NECK PAIN INTENSITY (100-MM VISUAL ANALOG SCALE), FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY (NECK DISABILITY INDEX), HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (SHORT-FORM 36 QUESTIONNAIRE, SF-36), GENERIC DISABILITY (DAYS WITH RESTRICTED ACTIVITIES), AND GLOBAL IMPROVEMENT. RESULTS: FROM BASELINE TO 12-MONTH FOLLOW-UP, PAIN INTENSITY IMPROVED FROM 48.81 +/- 17.71 TO 32.31 +/- 20.68 (P < 0.001), NECK-RELATED DISABILITY DECREASED FROM 25.26 +/- 9.02 TO 19.49 +/- 11.52 (P = 0.001), AND BODILY PAIN IN THE SF-36 IMPROVED FROM 49.37 +/- 12.40 TO 59.26 +/- 17.57 (P = 0.005). IMPROVEMENTS IN PAIN INTENSITY WERE PREDICTED BY WEEKLY MINUTES OF YOGA PRACTICE DURING THE PAST 4 WEEKS (R(2) = 0.12, P = 0.028); IMPROVED NECK-RELATED DISABILITY (R(2) = 0.24, P = 0.001) AND BODILY PAIN (R(2) = 0.26, P = 0.006) WERE PREDICTED BY REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE DURING THE PAST 12 MONTHS. GENERIC DISABILITY DID NOT DECREASE SIGNIFICANTLY. TWENTY-FOUR PATIENTS (68.6%) RATED THEIR HEALTH AS AT LEAST SOMEWHAT IMPROVED. CONCLUSIONS: A 9-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION IMPROVED PAIN AND NECK-RELATED DISABILITY FOR AT LEAST 12 MONTHS AFTER COMPLETION. SUSTAINED YOGA PRACTICE SEEMS TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT PREDICTOR OF LONG-TERM EFFECTIVENESS.	2013

10 2518 32 YOGA COMPARED TO NON-EXERCISE OR PHYSICAL THERAPY EXERCISE ON PAIN, DISABILITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) IS A COMMON AND OFTEN DISABLING MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITION. YOGA HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE AN EFFECTIVE THERAPY FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. HOWEVER, THERE ARE STILL CONTROVERSIES ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AT DIFFERENT FOLLOW-UP PERIODS AND COMPARED WITH OTHER PHYSICAL THERAPY EXERCISES. OBJECTIVE: TO CRITICALLY COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN ON PAIN, DISABILITY, QUALITY OF LIFE WITH NON-EXERCISE (E.G. USUAL CARE, EDUCATION), PHYSICAL THERAPY EXERCISE. METHODS: THIS STUDY WAS REGISTERED IN PROSPERO, AND THE REGISTRATION NUMBER WAS CRD42020159865. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) OF ONLINE DATABASES INCLUDED PUBMED, WEB OF SCIENCE, COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS, EMBASE WHICH EVALUATED EFFECTS OF YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN ON PAIN, DISABILITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE WERE SEARCHED FROM INCEPTION TIME TO NOVEMBER 1, 2019. STUDIES WERE ELIGIBLE IF THEY ASSESSED AT LEAST ONE IMPORTANT OUTCOME, NAMELY PAIN, BACK-SPECIFIC DISABILITY, QUALITY OF LIFE. THE COCHRANE RISK OF BIAS TOOL WAS USED TO ASSESS THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF INCLUDED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. THE CONTINUOUS OUTCOMES WERE ANALYZED BY CALCULATING THE MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) OR STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE (SMD) WITH 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CI) ACCORDING TO WHETHER COMBINING OUTCOMES MEASURED ON DIFFERENT SCALES OR NOT. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 18 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE INCLUDED IN THIS META-ANALYSIS. YOGA COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE PAIN AT 4 TO 8 WEEKS (MD = -0.83, 95% CI = -1.19 TO -0.48, P<0.00001, I2 = 0%), 3 MONTHS (MD = -0.43, 95% CI = -0.64 TO -0.23, P<0.0001, I2 = 0%), 6 TO 7 MONTHS (MD = -0.56, 95% CI = -1.02 TO -0.11, P = 0.02, I2 = 50%), AND WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT IN 12 MONTHS (MD = -0.52, 95% CI = -1.64 TO 0.59, P = 0.36, I2 = 87%) COMPARED WITH NON-EXERCISE. YOGA WAS BETTER THAN NON-EXERCISE ON DISABILITY AT 4 TO 8 WEEKS (SMD = -0.30, 95% CI = -0.51 TO -0.10, P = 0.003, I2 = 0%), 3 MONTHS (SMD = -0.31, 95% CI = -0.45 TO -0.18, P<0.00001, I2 = 30%), 6 MONTHS (SMD = -0.38, 95% CI = -0.53 TO -0.23, P<0.00001, I2 = 0%), 12 MONTHS (SMD = -0.33, 95% CI = -0.54 TO -0.12, P = 0.002, I2 = 9%). THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE ON PAIN, DISABILITY COMPARED WITH PHYSICAL THERAPY EXERCISE GROUP. FURTHERMORE, IT SUGGESTED THAT THERE WAS A NON-SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE ON PHYSICAL AND MENTAL QUALITY OF LIFE BETWEEN YOGA AND ANY OTHER INTERVENTIONS. CONCLUSION: THIS META-ANALYSIS PROVIDED EVIDENCE FROM VERY LOW TO MODERATE INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN PATIENTS AT DIFFERENT TIME POINTS. YOGA MIGHT DECREASE PAIN FROM SHORT TERM TO INTERMEDIATE TERM AND IMPROVE FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY STATUS FROM SHORT TERM TO LONG TERM COMPARED WITH NON-EXERCISE (E.G. USUAL CARE, EDUCATION). YOGA HAD THE SAME EFFECT ON PAIN AND DISABILITY AS ANY OTHER EXERCISE OR PHYSICAL THERAPY. YOGA MIGHT NOT IMPROVE THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL QUALITY OF LIFE BASED ON THE RESULT OF A MERGING.	2020

PARTICIPANTS: PARTICIPANTS (N=81) WITH MS (PATIENT DETERMINED DISEASE STEPS [PDDS] SELF-REPORTED DISEASE STATUS SCORES: 0-6) BETWEEN AGES OF 18 AND 65 YEARS WERE RANDOMIZED TO M2M (N=27), AY (N=26), OR WAITLIST CONTROL (N=28). INTERVENTIONS: BOTH M2M AND AY COMPLETED THREE 60-MINUTE EXERCISE SESSIONS PER WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS. WAITLIST CONTROLS RECEIVED BIWEEKLY NEWSLETTERS VIA MAIL THAT CONTAINED EDUCATIONAL INFORMATION ON LIVING WITH MS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PRIMARY MEASURES WERE TIMED UP AND GO (TUG, S) TEST, 6-MINUTE WALK TEST (6MWT, M), AND 5 TIMES SIT-TO-STAND TEST (FTSST, S). SECONDARY MEASURES WERE SELF-REPORTED OUTCOMES ASSESSED USING PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES MEASUREMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM FATIGUE AND PAIN INTERFERENCE SHORT FORM 8A. PARTICIPANTS WERE EVALUATED AT BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION. PRIMARY ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED USING AN INTENT-TO-TREAT MIXED MODEL ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE. RESULTS: COMPARISONS ACROSS ALL 3 GROUPS REVEALED SIGNIFICANT GROUP DIFFERENCES IN TUG AND 6MWT. POST HOC ANALYSES INDICATED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN TUG (LEAST SQUARE MEAN DIFFERENCE [95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL] = -1.9S [-3.3 TO -0.5], P=.01, D=0.7) AND 6MWT (41.0M [2.2-80.0], P=.04, D=0.6; CONTROLLED FOR PDDS) IN M2M COMPARED TO CONTROLS, WHILE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED WHEN COMPARED AY TO CONTROLS. NO SIGNIFICANT GROUP DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND IN FTSST, FATIGUE, AND PAIN INTERFERENCE. CONCLUSIONS: M2M MAY BE A USEFUL AND ENJOYABLE EXERCISE FORM FOR PEOPLE WITH MS IN IMPROVING MOBILITY AND WALKING ENDURANCE AND MERITS LONG-TERM STUDY IN LARGER STUDY POPULATIONS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
12 2114 18 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS. BACKGROUND: THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) HAS SHOWN VARIOUS RESULTS IN DIFFERENT REPORTS. AS A RESULT, PERFORMING A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS TO GUIDE PHYSICIANS AND PATIENTS SEEMS NECESSARY. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH MS. METHOD: THE PRESENT STUDY WAS DESIGNED BASED ON PRISMA GUIDELINES FROM THEIR INCEPTION UNTIL OCTOBER 2019. TWO RESEARCHERS INDEPENDENTLY PERFORMED ALL STEPS. WE SEARCHED SEVERAL INTERNATIONAL ONLINE DATABASES SUCH AS PUBMED/MEDILNE, SCOPUS, SCIENCE DIRECT, COCHRANE LIBRARY, PSYCINFO, WEB OF SCIENCE, CINAHL, CAM-QUEST, CAMBASE, INDMED AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR SEARCH ENGINE. THE DATA WERE ANALYZED USING COMPREHENSIVE META-ANALYSIS SOFTWARE VER. 2, WHILE P < 0.05 WAS CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT. THE PROTOCOL OF THIS META-ANALYSIS WAS REGISTERED AT PROSPERO WITH NUMBER IDENTIFIER: CRD42019127168. RESULTS: OVERALL, 693 PATIENTS WITH MS (YOGA (N = 209), EXERCISE (N = 298), CONTROL (N = 186) GROUPS) WERE EXAMINED IN TEN RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS). ACCORDING TO THIS META-ANALYSIS, THE EFFECT OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH MS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER COMPARED TO THE TYPICAL MS CARE GROUP [SMD = -0.872; 95%CI: -1.467 TO -0.277, P = 0.004], AND DID NOT SHOW SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE COMPARED TO THE EXERCISE GROUP [SMD = -0.093; 95%CI: -0.353 TO 0.167, P = 0.482]. THE EFFECT OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON THE OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE (COMPARED TO THE TYPICAL MS CARE GROUP: [SMD = 0.710; 95%CI: -0.172 TO 1.592, P = 0.114], AND COMPARED TO THE EXERCISE GROUP: [SMD = -0.453; 95%CI: -0.233 TO 1.138, P = 0.195]), PHYSICAL COMPONENT (COMPARED TO THE TYPICAL MS CARE GROUP: [SMD = 0.281; 95%CI: -0.157 TO 0.719, P = 0.209], AND COMPARED TO THE EXERCISE GROUP: [SMD = 0.074; 95%CI: -0.125 TO 0.273, P = 0.467]), PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPONENT (COMPARED TO THE TYPICAL MS CARE GROUP: [SMD = 0.250; 95% CI: - 0.132 TO 0.631, P = 0.199], AND COMPARED TO THE EXERCISE GROUP: [SMD = - 0.270; 95%CI: -0.813 TO 0.272, P = 0.329]), SEXUAL FUNCTION (COMPARED TO THE TYPICAL MS CARE GROUP: [SMD = 0.438; 95%CI: -0.350 TO 1.226, P = 0.276]), AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION (COMPARED TO THE TYPICAL MS CARE GROUP: [SMD = -0.390; 95%CI: -0.008 TO 0.789, P = 0.055]) IN PATIENTS WITH MS WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT. CONCLUSION: YOGA IS A SIMPLE EXERCISE FOR PATIENTS WITH MS THAT IS CAPABLE OF DECREASING FATIGUE IN THESE PATIENTS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
13 2040 21 THAI YOGA IMPROVES PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND WELL-BEING IN OLDER ADULTS: A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: COMPARE TWO 12-WEEK LOW-INTENSITY EXERCISE REGIMENS ON COMPONENTS OF PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN COMMUNITY-DWELLING HEALTHY YET SEDENTARY ADULTS AGED OVER 60. DESIGN: THIS STUDY USED A RANDOMISED, MULTI-ARM, CONTROLLED TRIAL DESIGN. METHODS: THIRTY-NINE SEDENTARY PARTICIPANTS (29 WOMEN), AGED 67.7+/-6.7 YEARS WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO EITHER A 12-WEEK THAI YOGA (TY) OR TAI CHI (TC) FOR 90MIN TWICE PER WEEK, OR TELEPHONE COUNSELLING CONTROL (C). A SENIOR FITNESS TEST (CHAIR-STAND, ARM-CURL, SIT-&-REACH, BACK-SCRATCH, 8-FOOT UP-&-GO AND 6-MIN WALK) AND SHORT-FORM 36 HEALTH SURVEY, CENTRE FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES OF DEPRESSION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY SCALE FOR THE ELDERLY AND THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ENJOYMENT SCALE WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE, SIX, 12 WEEKS, AND THREE MONTHS AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE REGIMEN. RESULTS: AFTER 12 WEEKS, CHAIR-STAND (MEAN DIFFERENCE, 2.69; 95% CI, 0.97-4.41; P<0.001), ARM-CURL (2.23; 95% CI, 0.06-4.52; P=0.009), SIT-&-REACH (1.25; 95% CI, 0.03-2.53; P=0.013), BACK-SCRATCH (2.00; 95% CI, 0.44-3.56; P=0.005), 8-FOOT UP-&-GO (-0.43; 95% CI, -0.85 TO 0.01; P=0.013), 6-MIN WALK (57.5; 95% CI, 20.93-94.07; P<0.001), VITALITY (13.27; 95% CI, 2.88-23.66; P=0.050) AND ENJOYMENT (7.96; 95% CI, 3.70-12.23; P=0.001) SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED IN TY COMPARED TO C, HOWEVER NO CHANGE WAS OBSERVED IN TC COMPARED TO C. TY IMPROVED IN CHAIR-STAND (2.31; 95% CI, 0.59-4.03; P=0.007), SIT-&-REACH (1.38; 95% CI, 0.10-2.66; P=0.007), 6-MIN WALK (32.31; 95% CI, -4.26-68.88; P=0.015), VITALITY (12.88; 95% CI, 2.50-23.27; P=0.040) AND ENJOYMENT (5.65; 95% CI, 1.39-9.92; P=0.010) COMPARED TO TC AFTER 12 WEEKS. CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT OLDER ADULTS CAN MAKE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR HEALTH AND WELL-BEING BY ENGAGING IN LOW INTENSITY THAI YOGA EXERCISE.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
14  641 26 DOES A MEDICAL THERAPEUTIC YOGA GROUP INTERVENTION REMEDIATE IMPAIRMENTS COMMONLY FOUND IN PEOPLE WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS? A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) IS A CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM RESULTING IN VARIED PHYSICAL AND COGNITIVE DEFICITS THAT OFTEN CONTRIBUTE TO CHANGES IN POSTURAL CONTROL AS WELL AS DECREASED SELF-EFFICACY AND LOWER PERCEIVED QUALITY OF LIFE. ONE INTERVENTION OFTEN RECOMMENDED FOR THE CONTROL OF MS SYMPTOMS IS REHABILITATION. WHILE REHABILITATION IS OFTEN EFFECTIVE, IT IS TRADITIONALLY DELIVERED IN A UNIDISCIPLINARY MANNER IN PRIVATE-SESSION FORMAT. THIS PILOT STUDY PRESENTS THE USE OF A BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL INTERDISCIPLINARY GROUP YOGA INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE POSTURAL CONTROL, SELF-EFFICACY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MS. METHODS: THIS PILOT STUDY EXAMINED 15 SUBJECTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN A 5-WEEK PROSPECTIVE MEDICAL THERAPEUTIC YOGA (MTY) PROGRAM DESIGNED FOR INDIVIDUALS DIAGNOSED WITH MS. PRE AND POST-TESTING WAS COMPLETED. RESULTS: THE PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED IMPROVEMENTS IN OVERALL BALANCE (T(14)=3.42, P=0.004), DUAL-TASKING (T(13)=2.30, P=0.034), DYNAMIC GAIT (T(14)=-2.311, P=0.021), REACTIVE BALANCE (T(114)=-2.157, P=0.031), AND SELF-EFFICACY (T(12)=3.40, P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: MTY OFFERS A BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL FRAMEWORK TO PROVIDE INTEGRATIVE INTERDISCIPLINARY CARE ACROSS DISCIPLINES. IN THIS PILOT INVESTIGATION, POSTURAL CONTROL AND FEELINGS OF SELF-EFFICACY IMPROVED. THIS MODALITY OF REHABILITATION WARRANTS FURTHER INVESTIGATION.	2020

FEASIBILITY WAS EXAMINED THROUGH COST, RECRUITMENT, RETENTION, ATTENDANCE, AND SAFETY. OUTCOMES INCLUDED THE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS QUALITY OF LIFE INVENTORY (MSQLI), 12-ITEM MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS WALKING SCALE (MSWS-12), TIMED 25-FOOT WALK TEST (T25FW), 6-MINUTE WALK TEST (6MWT), NINE-HOLE PEG TEST (NHPT), FIVE-TIMES SIT-TO-STAND TEST (FTSTS), MULTIDIRECTIONAL REACH TEST (MDRT), MAXIMUM EXPIRATORY PRESSURE, AND PACED AUDITORY SERIAL ADDITION TEST-3'' (PASAT-3''). RESULTS: FOURTEEN PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE STUDY. THE PROGRAM WAS FEASIBLE. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT MAIN EFFECTS ON THE 36-ITEM SHORT FORM HEALTH STATUS SURVEY MENTAL COMPONENT SUMMARY (SF-36 MCS), MODIFIED FATIGUE IMPACT SCALE (MFIS), BLADDER CONTROL SCALE (BLCS), PERCEIVED DEFICITS QUESTIONNAIRE (PDQ), MENTAL HEALTH INVENTORY (MHI), MSWS-12, T25FW, NHPT, PASAT-3'', 6MWT, FTSTS, AND MDRT-BACK. IMPROVEMENTS WERE FOUND ON THE SF-36 MCS, MFIS, BLCS, PDQ, MHI, AND MSWS-12 BETWEEN BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION. THE EFFECT ON PDQ PERSISTED AT FOLLOW-UP. IMPROVEMENTS WERE FOUND ON THE T25FW, NHPT, 6MWT, FTSTS, AND MDRT-BACK BETWEEN BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION THAT PERSISTED AT FOLLOW-UP. THE PASAT-3'' DID NOT CHANGE BETWEEN BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION BUT DID BETWEEN POSTINTERVENTION AND FOLLOW-UP. CONCLUSIONS: THE YOGA PROGRAM WAS SAFE AND FEASIBLE. IMPROVEMENTS IN CERTAIN MEASURES OF QOL AND PERFORMANCE WERE SEEN AT POSTINTERVENTION AND FOLLOW-UP.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
16  506 26 COMPARATIVE EFFECT OF POWER TRAINING AND HIGH-SPEED YOGA ON MOTOR FUNCTION IN OLDER PATIENTS WITH PARKINSON DISEASE. OBJECTIVES: TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF POWER TRAINING (PWT) AND A HIGH-SPEED YOGA PROGRAM ON PHYSICAL PERFORMANCES IN OLDER PATIENTS WITH PARKINSON DISEASE (PD), AND TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT BOTH TRAINING INTERVENTIONS WOULD ATTENUATE PD SYMPTOMS AND IMPROVE PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE. DESIGN: RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: A LABORATORY OF NEUROMUSCULAR RESEARCH AND ACTIVE AGING. PARTICIPANTS: PATIENTS WITH PD (N=41; MEAN AGE +/- SD, 72.2 +/- 6.5Y). INTERVENTIONS: TWO HIGH-SPEED EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS (SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED YOGA PROGRAM AND PWT) WERE GIVEN FOR 12 WEEKS (TWICE A WEEK), AND 1 NONEXERCISE CONTROL GROUP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: UNIFIED PARKINSON DISEASE RATING SCALE MOTOR SCORE (UPDRSMS), BERG BALANCE SCALE (BBS), MINI-BALANCE EVALUATION SYSTEMS TEST (MINI-BESTEST), TIMED UP AND GO, FUNCTIONAL REACH, SINGLE LEG STANCE (SLS), POSTURAL SWAY TEST, 10-M USUAL AND MAXIMAL WALKING SPEED TESTS, 1 REPETITION MAXIMUM (RM), AND PEAK POWER (PPW) FOR LEG PRESS. RESULTS: FOR THE POSTTESTS, BOTH TRAINING GROUPS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS (P<.05) IN ALL PHYSICAL MEASUREMENTS EXCEPT FUNCTIONAL REACH ON THE MORE AFFECTED SIDE, SLS, AND POSTURAL SWAY COMPARED WITH THE PRETESTS, AND SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER SCORES FOR UPDRSMS, BBS, MINI-BESTEST, TIMED UP AND GO, FUNCTIONAL REACH ON THE LESS AFFECTED SIDE, 10-M USUAL AND MAXIMAL WALKING SPEED TESTS, 1RM, AND PPW THAN CONTROLS, WITH NO DIFFERENCES DETECTED BETWEEN THE YOGA PROGRAM AND PWT. CONCLUSIONS: BOTH THE SPECIALLY DESIGNED YOGA PROGRAM AND PWT PROGRAMS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE IN OLDER PERSONS WITH PD.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
17 2833 27 YOGA'S EFFECT ON FALLS IN RURAL, OLDER ADULTS. BACKGROUND: UNINTENTIONAL FALLS AFFECT 30% OF PEOPLE OVER AGE 65 YEARS. YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE BALANCE. WE DESIGNED THIS STUDY TO EXAMINE IF YOGA REDUCES FALLS. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED 16 SESSIONS OF HATHA YOGA OVER 8 WEEKS. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO PRACTICE 10MIN OF YOGA DAILY AT HOME IN ADDITION TO 5-MIN RELAXATION EXERCISES OR RELAXATION EXERCISES ONLY (CONTROL GROUP). RESULTS: OF THE 38 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETING THE INTERVENTION, 15 PARTICIPANTS REPORTED A TOTAL OF 27 FALLS IN THE 6-MONTHS BEFORE THE STUDY, COMPARED TO 13 PARTICIPANTS SUSTAINING 14 FALLS IN THE 6 MONTHS FROM THE START OF THE STUDY (P<0.047), WITHOUT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOGA HOME-EXERCISE AND HOME RELAXATION-ONLY GROUPS. COMPARED TO BASELINE SCORES, ALL PARTICIPANTS IMPROVED ON THE BERG BALANCE SCALE (53-54 OUT OF 56, P=0.002), THE FUNCTIONAL GAIT ASSESSMENT (22.9-25.8 OUT OF 30 POINTS, P<0.001), AND THE DYNAMIC GAIT INDEX (20.6-22.4 OUT OF 24 POINTS, P<0.001). RIGHT LEG STAND TIME IMPROVED FROM A MEAN OF 13.3S TO 17.1S (P=0.020) AND STANDING FORWARD REACH DISTANCE FROM 26.0CM TO 29.6CM (P<0.001). WITHOUT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS. CONFIDENCE, WITH THE ACTIVITIES-SPECIFIC BALANCE CONFIDENCE SCALE, INCREASED IN THE YOGA HOME-EXERCISE GROUP (88%-93%, P=0.037) COMPARED TO 90% UNCHANGED FROM PRE-INTERVENTION IN THE HOME RELAXATION-ONLY GROUP. CONCLUSION: YOGA CLASSES REDUCE SELF-REPORTED FALLS AND IMPROVE BALANCE MEASURES. THE ADDITION OF HOME YOGA EXERCISES DID NOT ENHANCE BENEFIT OVER RELAXATION EXERCISE ONLY.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
18   34 31 A 12-WEEK IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM IMPROVED BALANCE AND MOBILITY IN OLDER COMMUNITY-DWELLING PEOPLE: A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: EXERCISE THAT CHALLENGES BALANCE CAN IMPROVE MOBILITY AND PREVENT FALLS IN OLDER ADULTS. YOGA AS A PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OPTION FOR OLDER ADULTS IS NOT WELL STUDIED. THIS TRIAL EVALUATED THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFECT OF A 12-WEEK IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM ON BALANCE AND MOBILITY IN OLDER PEOPLE. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A BLINDED, PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS. PARTICIPANTS WERE 54 COMMUNITY DWELLERS (MEAN AGE 68 YEARS, SD 7.1) NOT CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING IN YOGA OR TAI CHI. THE INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 27) PARTICIPATED IN A 12-WEEK, TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA PROGRAM FOCUSED ON STANDING POSTURES AND RECEIVED A FALL PREVENTION EDUCATION BOOKLET. THE CONTROL GROUP (N = 27) RECEIVED THE EDUCATION BOOKLET ONLY. PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS STANDING BALANCE COMPONENT OF THE SHORT PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE BATTERY WITH ADDITION OF ONE-LEGGED STANCE TIME (STANDING BALANCE). SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE THE TIMED SIT-TO-STAND TEST, TIMED 4-M WALK, ONE-LEGGED STAND WITH EYES CLOSED, AND SHORT FALLS EFFICACY SCALE-INTERNATIONAL. FEASIBILITY WAS MEASURED BY RECORDING CLASS ATTENDANCE AND ADVERSE EVENTS. RESULTS: FIFTY-TWO PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENTS. THE INTERVENTION GROUP SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED COMPARED WITH CONTROL GROUP ON STANDING BALANCE (MEAN DIFFERENCE = 1.52 SECONDS, 95% CI 0.10-2.96, P = .04), SIT-TO-STAND TEST (MEAN DIFFERENCE = -3.43 SECONDS, 95% CI -5.23 TO -1.64, P < .001), 4-M WALK (MEAN DIFFERENCE = -0.50 SECONDS, 95% CI -0.72 TO -0.28, P < .001), AND ONE-LEGGED STAND WITH EYES CLOSED (MEAN DIFFERENCE = 1.93 SECONDS, 95% CI 0.40-3.46, P = .02). AVERAGE CLASS ATTENDANCE WAS 20 OF 24 CLASSES (83%). NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS OCCURRED. CONCLUSIONS: THIS TRIAL DEMONSTRATES THE BALANCE AND MOBILITY-RELATED BENEFITS AND FEASIBILITY OF IYENGAR YOGA FOR OLDER PEOPLE. THE FALL PREVENTION EFFECT OF IYENGAR YOGA WARRANTS FURTHER INVESTIGATION.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
19 2653 35 YOGA IMPROVES OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE, DEPRESSION, AND DAILY ACTIVITIES FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC PAIN IS A COMPLEX ACCUMULATION OF PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS, THUS INTERVENTIONS THAT ADDRESS PAIN AND PROMOTE OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE ARE NEEDED. A HOLISTIC INTERVENTION, WITH MIND AND BODY COMPONENTS, IS LIKELY NECESSARY TO BEST TREAT THE COMPLEXITIES OF CHRONIC PAIN. THUS, WE DEVELOPED AND TESTED A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN. OBJECTIVES: IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL (RCT), PARTICIPANTS WITH CHRONIC PAIN WERE RANDOMIZED TO A YOGA INTERVENTION OR USUAL CARE GROUP. BETWEEN AND WITHIN GROUP DIFFERENCES FOR PRE-AND POST-OUTCOME MEASURE SCORES WERE ASSESSED FOR: OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE, COMPLETION OF ACTIVITIES, AND DEPRESSION. METHODS: PILOT RCT WITH PARTICIPANT ALLOCATION TO 8 WEEKS OF YOGA OR USUAL CARE. BOTH GROUPS RECEIVED ONGOING MONTHLY SELF-MANAGEMENT PROGRAMMING. DATA WERE COLLECTED BEFORE AND AFTER THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA OR USUAL CARE AFTER BASELINE ASSESSMENTS. DEMOGRAPHICS WERE COLLECTED AND MEASURES INCLUDED: CANADIAN OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE MEASURE (COPM) TO ASSESS OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE; THE 15-ITEM FRENCHAY ACTIVITIES INDEX (FAI)(ACTIVITIES); AND THE 9-ITEM PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE (PHQ-9) FOR DEPRESSION. INDEPENDENT T-TESTS WERE USED TO ASSESS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS. PAIRED T-TESTS WERE USED TO ASSESS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRE- AND POST 8-WEEK INTERVENTION FOR BOTH THE YOGA AND THE USUAL CARE GROUPS. PERCENT CHANGE SCORES AND EFFECT SIZES WERE CALCULATED. RESULTS: 83 PEOPLE WERE RECRUITED FOR THE STUDY AND COMPLETED BASELINE ASSESSMENTS; 44 INDIVIDUALS WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA AND 39 TO THE CONTROL GROUP. THE AVERAGE AGE OF ALL PARTICIPANTS WAS 51.4+/-10.5 YEARS, 68% WERE FEMALE; AND 60% HAD AT LEAST SOME COLLEGE EDUCATION. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN DEMOGRAPHICS OR OUTCOME MEASURES BETWEEN GROUPS AT BASELINE OR 8 WEEKS; HOWEVER, THE STUDY WAS NOT POWERED TO SEE SUCH DIFFERENCES. INDIVIDUALS RANDOMIZED TO THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE IN ANY OUTCOME MEASURE OVER THE 8 WEEKS. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN COPM PERFORMANCE AND COPM SATISFACTION SCORES FOR INDIVIDUALS RANDOMIZED TO THE YOGA GROUP; BOTH SCORES SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED. COPM PERFORMANCE IMPROVED BY 27% WITH A MODERATE TO LARGE EFFECT SIZE (3.66+/-1.85 VS 4.66+/-1.93, P < 0.001, D = 0.76). COPM SATISFACTION SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED BY 78% (2.14+/-2.31 VS. 3.80+/-2.50, P < 0.001) AND HAD A LARGE EFFECTS SIZE (D = 1.02). FAI SCORES IMPROVED, INDICATING INCREASED ACTIVITY OR ENGAGEMENT IN DAILY OCCUPATION DURING THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION. SCORES INCREASED BY 5% (38.13+/-8.48 VS. 39.90+/-8.57, P = 0.024) WITH A SMALL EFFECT SIZE (D = 0.37). DEPRESSION SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED FROM 13.21+/-5.60 TO 11.41+/-5.82, P = 0.041, WITH A SMALL EFFECT SIZE. CONCLUSION: DATA FROM THIS PILOT RCT INDICATE YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION WITH PEOPLE IN CHRONIC PAIN TO IMPROVE OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE, INCREASE ENGAGEMENT IN ACTIVITIES, AND DECREASE DEPRESSION. OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY PRACTITIONERS MAY CONSIDER ADDING YOGA AS A TREATMENT INTERVENTION TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH PAIN.	2019	

20   88 22 A MIXED METHODS EVALUATION OF YOGA AS A FALL PREVENTION STRATEGY FOR OLDER PEOPLE IN INDIA. BACKGROUND: FALLS ARE AN EMERGING PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE IN INDIA, WITH THE IMPACT SET TO RISE AS THE POPULATION AGES. WE SOUGHT TO EVALUATE THE ACCEPTABILITY, FEASIBILITY AND LIKELY IMPACT OF A YOGA-BASED PROGRAM AIMED AT IMPROVING BALANCE AND MOBILITY FOR OLDER RESIDENTS IN URBAN INDIA. METHODS: FIFTY LOCAL RESIDENTS AGED 60 YEARS AND OLDER WERE RECRUITED FROM URBAN HYDERABAD, ANDHRA PRADESH. THEY WERE INVITED TO ATTEND A 1-H YOGA CLASS, TWICE WEEKLY FOR 3 MONTHS. MIXED METHODS WERE USED TO EVALUATE THE ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY (QUALITATIVE) AND LIKELY IMPACT (QUANTITATIVE). TWO FOCUS GROUPS AND EIGHT INTERVIEWS WITH PARTICIPANTS WERE CONDUCTED TO EVALUATE THE ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA PROGRAM. THEMATIC ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED IN CONTEXT OF PERCEPTIONS, BARRIERS AND BENEFITS OF YOGA PARTICIPATION AND FALL ASCERTAINMENT. PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE USING THE SHORT PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE BATTERY, FEAR OF FALLING, BLOOD PRESSURE AND WEIGHT LOSS WERE MEASURED BEFORE AND AFTER THE PROGRAM. RESULTS: THE INTERVIEWS AND FOCUS GROUPS PROVIDED INSIGHTS INTO THE PREFERRED FORMAT FOR CLASSES, INCLUDING SESSION TIMES, LEVEL OF SUPERVISION AND LOCATION. IMPROVEMENTS WERE SEEN IN THE SHORT FALLS EFFICACY SCALE-INTERNATIONAL (SHORT FES-I (15.9 +/- 4.0 VS 13.8 +/- 2.1 S, P = 0.002)), THE NUMBER OF STEPS TAKEN IN THE TIMED 4-M WALK (T4MW (9.0 +/- 1.8 VS 8.6 +/- 1.8, P = 0.04)), SHORT FES-I SCORES (9.4 +/- 2.9 VS 8.6 +/- 2.9, P = 0.02) AND WEIGHT (63.8 +/- 12.4 VS 62.1 +/- 11.6, P = 0.004) WERE LOWER. NO CHANGES WERE SEEN IN STANDING BALANCE, BLOOD PRESSURE OR T4MW TIME. CONCLUSION: YOGA WAS WELL ACCEPTED AND RESULTED IN IMPROVED ABILITY TO RISE FROM A CHAIR, WEIGHT LOSS, INCREASED STEP LENGTH AND REDUCED FEAR OF FALLING. THESE RESULTS PROVIDE IMPETUS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH EVALUATING YOGA AS A FALL PREVENTION STRATEGY IN INDIA.	2018

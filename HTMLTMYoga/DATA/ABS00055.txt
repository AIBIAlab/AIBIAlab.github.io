1   55 137 A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF YOGA WITH PAROXETINE FOR THE TREATMENT OF PREMATURE EJACULATION: A PILOT STUDY. CONTEXT: PREMATURE EJACULATION (PME) IS A COMMON SEXUAL DISORDER. DRUGS USED COMMONLY USED FOR ITS TREATMENT HAVE VARIOUS SIDE EFFECTS AND DISADVANTAGES. YOGA IS BEING INCREASINGLY STUDIED IN A VARIETY OF MEDICAL DISORDERS WITH POSITIVE RESULTS. HOWEVER, ITS EVIDENCE FOR PATIENTS WITH PME IS VERY LIMITED. AIMS: THE AIMS OF THIS STUDY WERE TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON EJACULATION TIME IN PATIENTS WITH PME AND TO COMPARE IT WITH PAROXETINE. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: THIS WAS A NONRANDOMIZED NONBLINDED COMPARATIVE STUDY IN A TERTIARY CARE CENTER. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AMONG PATIENTS WITH PME, 40 SELECTED PAROXETINE AND 28 YOGA. INTRAVAGINAL EJACULATION LATENCY TIME (IELT) WAS MEASURED IN SECONDS ONCE BEFORE AND THREE TIMES AFTER INTERVENTION. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: MEAN, STANDARD DEVIATION, PAIRED AND UNPAIRED T-TESTS, AND REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA WERE USED FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. RESULTS: IELT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN BOTH GROUPS - PAROXETINE (FROM 29.85 +/- 11.9 TO 82.19 +/- 32.9) AND YOGA (FROM 25.88 +/- 16.1 TO 88697 + 26.9). ALTHOUGH THE EFFECT OF YOGA WAS SLIGHTLY DELAYED IN ONSET, ITS EFFECT SIZE (ETA(2) = 0.87, P < 0.05) WAS MORE THAN PAROXETINE (ETA(2) = 0.73, P < 0.05). ONE-FIFTH OF THE PATIENTS IN THE PAROXETINE GROUP (19.5%) AND 8% IN THE YOGA GROUP CONTINUED TO HAVE THE PROBLEM OF PME AT THE END OF THE TRIAL. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA CAUSED IMPROVEMENT IN BOTH INTRAVAGINAL EJACULATION LATENCY TIME AND SUBJECTIVE SEXUAL EXPERIENCE WITH MINIMAL SIDE EFFECT. THEREFORE, YOGA COULD BE AN EASILY ACCESSIBLE ECONOMICAL NONPHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT OPTION FOR THE PATIENT WITH PME.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
2 1178  33 EVALUATION OF STAMBHANAKARAKA YOGA AND COUNSELING IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SHUKRAGATA VATA (PREMATURE EJACULATION). PREMATURE EJACULATION (PE) IS A VERY COMMON MALE SEXUAL PROBLEM. ANXIETY, STRESS, FEAR ETC., ARE THE MAIN PREDISPOSING FACTORS OF PE. IN AYURVEDA, THIS CONDITION CAN BE CORRELATED WITH SHUKRAGATA VATA. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, FIFTY FIVE PATIENTS WITH PE WERE GROUPED INTO TWO AND WERE TREATED WITH STAMBHANAKARAKA YOGA (N = 30) AND PLACEBO (N = 20) FOR A DURATION OF TWO MONTHS, WITH LUKE WARM WATER AS ANUPANA. PSYCHOLOGICAL COUNSELING WAS GIVEN TO THE PATIENTS IN BOTH THE GROUPS. AFTER COMPLETION OF TREATMENT, STAMBHANAKARAKA YOGA SHOWED SIGNIFICANT RESULTS AGAINST PLACEBO IN ALL PARAMETERS, NAMELY INTRAVAGINAL EJACULATION LATENCY TIME (IELT), VOLUNTARY CONTROL OVER EJACULATION, PATIENT AND PARTNER'S SATISFACTION, PERFORMANCE ANXIETY.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
3 2672  47 YOGA IN PREMATURE EJACULATION: A COMPARATIVE TRIAL WITH FLUOXETINE. INTRODUCTION: YOGA IS A POPULAR FORM OF COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT. IT IS PRACTICED BOTH IN DEVELOPING AND DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. USE OF YOGA FOR VARIOUS BODILY AILMENTS IS RECOMMENDED IN ANCIENT AYVURVEDIC (AYUS = LIFE, VEDA = KNOWLEDGE) TEXTS AND IS BEING INCREASINGLY INVESTIGATED SCIENTIFICALLY. MANY PATIENTS AND YOGA PROTAGONISTS CLAIM THAT IT IS USEFUL IN SEXUAL DISORDERS. WE ARE INTERESTED IN KNOWING IF IT WORKS FOR PATIENTS WITH PREMATURE EJACULATION (PE) AND IN COMPARING ITS EFFICACY WITH FLUOXETINE, A KNOWN TREATMENT OPTION FOR PE. AIM: TO KNOW IF YOGA COULD BE TRIED AS A TREATMENT OPTION IN PE AND TO COMPARE IT WITH FLUOXETINE. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 68 PATIENTS (38 YOGA GROUP; 30 FLUOXETINE GROUP) ATTENDING THE OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY OF A TERTIARY CARE HOSPITAL WERE ENROLLED IN THE PRESENT STUDY. BOTH SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT TOOLS WERE ADMINISTERED TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF THE YOGA AND FLUOXETINE IN PE. THREE PATIENTS DROPPED OUT OF THE STUDY CITING THEIR INABILITY TO COPE UP WITH THE YOGA SCHEDULE AS THE REASON. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: INTRAVAGINAL EJACULATORY LATENCIES IN YOGA GROUP AND FLUOXETINE CONTROL GROUPS. RESULTS: WE FOUND THAT ALL 38 PATIENTS (25-65.7% = GOOD, 13-34.2% = FAIR) BELONGING TO YOGA AND 25 OUT OF 30 OF THE FLUOXETINE GROUP (82.3%) HAD STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PE. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA APPEARS TO BE A FEASIBLE, SAFE, EFFECTIVE AND ACCEPTABLE NONPHARMACOLOGICAL OPTION FOR PE. MORE STUDIES INVOLVING LARGER PATIENTS COULD BE CARRIED OUT TO ESTABLISH ITS UTILITY IN THIS CONDITION.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
4  712  36 EFFECT OF INTEGRATED YOGA ON ANTI-PSYCHOTIC INDUCED SIDE EFFECTS AND COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM SCHIZOPHRENIA. BACKGROUND TWENTY ONE (12 FEMALES) SUBJECTS, DIAGNOSED WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA BY A PSYCHIATRIST USING ICD-10, IN THE AGES 52.87 + 9.5YEARS AND SUFFERING SINCE 24.0 +/- 3.05YEARS WERE RECRUITED INTO THE STUDY FROM A SCHIZOPHRENIA REHABILITATION CENTER IN BENGALURU. METHODS ALL SUBJECTS WERE TAKING ANTI-PSYCHOTIC MEDICATIONS AND WERE IN STABLE STATE FOR MORE THAN A MONTH. PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATIONS WERE KEPT CONSTANT DURING THE STUDY PERIOD. ASSESSMENTS WERE DONE AT THREE POINTS OF TIME: (1) BASELINE, (2) AFTER ONE MONTH OF USUAL ROUTINE (PRE) AND (3) AFTER FIVE MONTHS OF VALIDATED INTEGRATED YOGA (IY) INTERVENTION (POST). VALIDATED 1H YOGA MODULE (CONSISTING OF ASANAS, PRANAYAMA, RELAXATION TECHNIQUES AND CHANTINGS) WAS PRACTICED FOR 5MONTHS, FIVE SESSIONS PER WEEK. ANTIPSYCHOTIC-INDUCED SIDE EFFECTS WERE ASSESSED USING SIMPSON ANGUS SCALE (SAS) AND UDVALG FOR KLINISKE UNDERSOGELSER (UKU) SIDE EFFECT RATING SCALE. COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS (USING TRAIL MAKING TEST A AND B), CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND ANTHROPOMETRY WERE ASSESSED AS SECONDARY VARIABLES. COMPARISONS BETWEEN "PRE" AND "POST" DATA WAS DONE USING PAIRED SAMPLES T-TESTS AFTER SUBTRACTING BASELINE SCORES FROM THEM RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS AT THE END OF FIVE MONTHS, SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DRUG-INDUCED PARKINSONIAN SYMPTOMS (SAS SCORE; P=0.001) AND 38 ITEMS OF UKU SCALE WAS OBSERVED ALONG WITH SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PROCESSING SPEED, EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS AND NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA PATIENTS. NO SIDE EFFECTS OF YOGA WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS THE PRESENT STUDY PROVIDES PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE FOR USEFULNESS OF INTEGRATED YOGA INTERVENTION IN MANAGING ANTI-PSYCHOTIC-INDUCED SIDE EFFECTS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
5 2115  30 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH HAEMOPHILIA. THE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY HAEMOPHILIA LEAD TO IMPAIRMENTS OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH HAEMOPHILIA. THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH HAEMOPHILIA IN SHIRAZ, IRAN. THIS SEMI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WITH PRE- AND POST-TEST DESIGN WAS PERFORMED ON 27 BOYS BETWEEN 8 AND 16 YEARS OLD WHO SUFFERED FROM HAEMOPHILIA. THE PATIENTS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS. THE NUMBER OF BLEEDINGS, ABSENCES FROM SCHOOL, AND REFERRALS TO THE CLINIC WAS EVALUATED. THE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH INTERVIEWS AND USING THE PATIENTS' RECORDS IN THE HAEMOPHILIA CENTER. BESIDES, THE QUALITY OF LIFE WAS ASSESSED THROUGH THE HAEMO-QOL QUESTIONNAIRE. THEN, THE YOGA INTERVENTION WAS PERFORMED FOR 14 WEEKS AND THE DATA WERE COLLECTED IN THREE STAGES. THE COLLECTED DATA WERE ENTERED INTO THE SPSS STATISTICAL SOFTWARE, VERSION 18 AND WERE ANALYZED USING NON-PARAMETRIC FRIEDMAN TEST. AFTER THE INTERVENTION, SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED IN THE MEAN SCORES OF QUALITY OF LIFE DIMENSIONS AND THE NUMBER OF BLEEDINGS, SCHOOL ABSENCES, AND REFERRALS TO THE HAEMOPHILIA CLINIC (P<0.001). THUS, YOGA MAY IMPROVE THE HAEMOPHILIA CHILDREN'S AND ADOLESCENTS' PERCEPTION OF QUALITY OF LIFE WITHOUT THE RISK OF INJURY. THIS INTERVENTION ALSO SEEMED TO BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE NUMBER OF BLEEDINGS, REFERRALS TO THE HAEMOPHILIA CLINIC, AND ABSENCES FROM SCHOOL.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
6  918  24 EFFECTIVENESS OF TRAINING PROGRAM COMBINING CHAKRAYOGA AND MEDITATION. BACKGROUND THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PROGRAM COMBINING CHAKRAYOGA AND MEDITATION ON THE PHYSICAL HEALTH AND DISEASE-RELATED FACTORS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS OF PEOPLE. METHODS NINETY-SEVEN SUBJECTS (32-83 YEARS OLD) WHO HAD FREE FROM PRIOR EXPERIENCES IN MEDITATION PROGRAMS OR CHAKRAYOGA TRAINING COURSES WERE ASSIGNED TO EITHER THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (EXP) (45 SUBJECTS; 13 MALE SUBJECTS AND 32 FEMALE SUBJECTS; AVERAGE AGE OF 60.67 YEARS, SD=11.09 YEARS) OR THE CONTROL GROUP (CONT) OF REMAINING SUBJECTS (52 SUBJECTS; 14 MALE SUBJECTS AND 38 FEMALE SUBJECTS; AVERAGE AGE OF 61.58 YEARS, SD=9.70 YEARS). SUBJECTS IN THE EXP PARTICIPATED IN THE CHAKRAYOGA MEDITATION PROGRAM FOR TWICE A WEEK FOR 2 H DURING 6 WEEKS IN EACH SESSION CONSISTED OF 1 H OF CHAKRAYOGA AND 1 H OF MEDITATION. THE MEASUREMENTS IN THIS STUDY INCLUDED THE MINDFULNESS, STRESS RESPONSE, SUBJECTIVE QUALITY OF LIFE, MEDICAL SYMPTOM CHECKLIST, DIFFICULTY IN EMOTIONAL REGULATION AND OBJECTIVE OF LIFE AND SENSE OF CONTROL. RESULTS RESULTS REVEALED THAT PARTICIPANTS IN THE EXP REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE RELIEF OF MINDFULNESS, STRESS RESPONSE, SUBJECTIVE QUALITY OF LIFE AND MEDICAL SYMPTOM CHECKLIST THAN THOSE IN THE CONT. CONCLUSIONS THESE FINDINGS PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT THE CHAKRAYOGA MEDITATION PROGRAM CAN HELP RELIEVE THE PHYSICAL HEALTH AND DISEASE-RELATED FACTORS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
7 2757  32 YOGA PRACTICES AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING OF STUDENT NURSES. YOGA HAS BEEN WITH US SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL, BUT IT IS ONLY DURING RECENT YEARS THAT IT HAS ASSUMED WORLDWIDE IMPORTANCE. THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE CT OF SELECTED YOGA PRACTICES ON PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING. IN THIS QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL ONE GROUP PRE-TEST AND POST- TEST STUDY, 83 UNDER GRADUATE STUDENT NURSES. WERE TAUGHT SELECTED YOGA EXERCISES. THE SE- LECTED YOGA EXERCISES WERE SYSTEMATIC RELAXATION, BREATHING, AND STRETCHING THAT WERE PER- FORMED IN THE FORMATIVE MANNER. THE' INTERVENTION WAS CARRIED OUT FOR THE MINIMAL DURATION OF ONE HOUR PER DAY, THREE DAYS A WEEK FOR A PERIOD OF 6 WEEKS. ASSESSMENT WAS- CARRIED OUT ON THE FIRST AND LAST- DAY OF THE INTERVENTION, USING-A MODIFIED HINDI VERSION OF POSITIVE AFFECT AND NEGATIVE AFFECT SCALE, (PANAS-H). IT,HAS 10 QUESTIONS EACH TO MEASURE POSITIVE (PA) AND NEGA- TIVE AFFECT (NA). SINCE THE DATA WAS TESTED AND FORMED A NORMAL DISTRIBUTION, THE PAIRED 'T' TEST WAS USED FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. THE. MEAN PA SCORE OF 42.92 AFTER YOGA PRACTICE WAS STATISTI- CALLY HIGHER THAN THE MEAN PA SCORE OF 32. 50 BEFORE YOGA PRACTICE (P=O. 01). THE MEAN NA SCORE OF 20.75 AFTER YOGA PRACTICE WAS LOWER THAN THE MEAN NA SCORE OF 23.33 BEFORE YOGA PRACTICE (P=0.427). THE YOGA PRACTICE CAN BE TAUGHT TO NORMALPARTICIPANTS AS IT MAY REDUCE NEGATIVE AFFECT AND INCREASE THE POSITIVE AFFECT WITHIN A FEW WEEKS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
8 1629  28 MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA FOR YOUTH WITH PERSISTENT CONCUSSION: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: WE EXPLORED THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA (MBY) FOR YOUTH WITH PERSISTENT CONCUSSION BY EXAMINING OCCUPATION-BASED AND NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL OUTCOMES. METHOD: IN THIS CASE SERIES DESIGN STUDY, 6 YOUTHS AGES 13-17 YR WITH CONCUSSION SYMPTOMS FOR >4 WK PARTICIPATED IN AN 8-WK MBY INTERVENTION, 1X/WK FOR 45 MIN. PARTICIPATION, SELF-EFFICACY, AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY (24 HR) WERE COLLECTED BEFORE, AFTER, AND 3 MO AFTER THE INTERVENTION. HEART RATE VARIABILITY WAS ALSO MEASURED DURING EACH SESSION. RESULTS: TRENDS OF INCREASED SELF-EFFICACY IN ACADEMIC, SOCIAL, AND EMOTIONAL DOMAINS WERE FOUND AFTER MBY AND MAINTAINED AT 3-MO FOLLOW-UP. TRENDS OF INCREASING HEART RATE VARIABILITY WERE ALSO FOUND PRE- TO POSTINTERVENTION AND WITHIN THE EIGHT MBY SESSIONS. CONCLUSION: PRELIMINARY RESULTS REVEAL POSITIVE TRENDS AFTER A NOVEL, SAFE INTERVENTION FOR YOUTH WITH PERSISTENT CONCUSSION SYMPTOMS AND THE VALUE OF EXPLORING BOTH OCCUPATION-BASED AND NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES. FUTURE RESEARCH WITH A LARGER SAMPLE AND CONTROL GROUP IS WARRANTED.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
9 2905  38 [LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF BREATHING EXERCISES AND YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA]. TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF BREATHING EXERCISES (BE) OR YOGA (Y) ON THE COURSE OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA WE STUDIED 36 SUBJECTS WITH A MILD DISEASE. THE PATIENTS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO 3 GROUPS. 2 OF THEM PARTICIPATED IN A 3 WEEKS TRAINING PROGRAM OF BE OR Y WHILE THE THIRD GROUP RESTED WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL TREATMENT (CONTROL GROUP, C). AT THE END OF THE TRAINING PERIOD THE PATIENTS WERE ASKED TO PRACTISE BE OR Y ON THEIR OWN. DRUG THERAPY AND LUNG FUNCTION PARAMETERS BEFORE AND AFTER A BETA 2-AGONIST METERED DOSE INHALER (ALBUTEROL, ALB) WERE RECORDED PRIOR TO THE TRAINING PROGRAM AND IN 4 WEEKS INTERVALS FOR 4 MONTHS THEREAFTER. THE RESPONSE TO THE BETA 2-AGONIST WAS DOCUMENTED CONTINUOUSLY IN 28 PATIENTS. THE MENTAL STATE OF THE PATIENTS WAS ELUCIDATED BY QUESTIONNAIRES.--PRIOR TO THE STUDY A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF INHALED ALB ON THE FEV1 WAS SHOWN WITHOUT ANY SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN GROUP DIFFERENCES. BOTH, BE AND Y, CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT AMELIORATION OF THE MENTAL STATE BUT ONLY THE BE INDUCED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OF LUNG FUNCTION PARAMETERS COMPARED TO THE INDIVIDUAL BASELINE VALUES. THE FEV1 INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY BY 356.3 +/- 146.2 ML (P < 0.05) AND THE VC BY 225.0 +/- 65.5 ML (P < 0.01). THESE LONG-TERM CHANGES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE ACTUAL RESPONSE TO ALB. BE DECREASED THE RV SIGNIFICANTLY BY 306.3 +/- 111.6 ML (P < 0.05), AN EFFECT SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COMPARED TO THE BETA 2-AGONIST (P < 0.01). BE IN COMBINATION WITH ALB CAUSED AN ADDITIVE EFFECT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	1994	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
10 1932  37 ROLE OF YOGA IN MODIFYING ANXIETY LEVEL IN WOMEN. ANXIETY LEADS TO DERANGEMENT IN PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. ANXIETY LEVELS ARE MORE IN FULL TIME HOUSEWIVES THAN WORKING WOMEN. THERE IS A NEED FOR SIMPLE, EASY TREATMENT FOR ANXIETY TO ALLEVIATE THE BURDEN ON HEALTH CAUSED BY ANXIETY. YOGA IS AMONG THE TOP TEN COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE THERAPIES. OUR STUDY AIMED TO DETERMINE THE ANXIETY LEVELS IN APPARENTLY HEALTHY FULL TIME HOUSEWIVES AND TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON ANXIETY LEVELS AMONG THEM. PRESENT STUDY IS A COMPARATIVE INTERVENTIONAL STUDY. STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON 50 APPARENTLY HEALTHY FULL TIME HOUSEWIVES (20-50 YEARS) WHO ATTENDED ONE MONTH YOGA CAMP. HAMILTON ANXIETY (HAMA) SCALE WAS USED TO EVALUATE ANXIETY LEVELS BEFORE AND AT THE END OF THE YOGA CAMP. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS DONE BY PAIRED T TEST USING SPSS 9.0. THE BASELINE PULSE RATE, SBP, DBP WERE 82.90 +/- 4.25 BPM, 124.84 +/- 11.022 MM HG, 85.20 +/- 10.81 MM HG RESPECTIVELY. AFTER FOUR WEEKS YOGA CAMP THERE WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT LOWERING OF PULSE RATE (77.58 +/- 3.86 BPM), SBP (117.92 +/- 6.76 MM HG), DBP (78.68 +/- 6.62 MM HG). BEFORE YOGA TRAINING, PERCENTAGE DISTRIBUTIONS OF SUBJECTS WITH MILD, MODERATE AND SEVERE ANXIETY WERE 6%, 18% AND 76% RESPECTIVELY. AT THE END OF FOUR WEEK YOGA TRAINING, PERCENTAGE DISTRIBUTIONS OF SUBJECTS WITH MILD, MODERATE AND SEVERE ANXIETY WERE 44.23%, 19.23% AND 36.53% RESPECTIVELY. THERE WAS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT (P = 0.000) DIFFERENCE IN THE MEAN VALUES OF TOTAL SCORE BEFORE (33.71 +/- 4.90) AND AFTER (26.93 +/- 4.53) YOGA. THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THERE WAS A REDUCTION IN THE SEVERITY OF ANXIETY FROM SEVERE TO MODERATE AND MILD INDICATING DECREASE IN ANXIETY FOLLOWING YOGA. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR STUDY, WE CONCLUDE THAT REGULAR YOGIC PRACTICES AND ADAPTING AND IMPLEMENTING THE PRINCIPALS AND PHILOSOPHY OF YOGA IN DAY TO DAY LIFE MAY DECREASE THE ANXIETY LEVEL.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
11 2771  22 YOGA REDUCES SYMPTOMS OF DISTRESS IN TSUNAMI SURVIVORS IN THE ANDAMAN ISLANDS. A MONTH AFTER THE DECEMBER 2004 TSUNAMI THE EFFECT OF A 1 WEEK YOGA PROGRAM WAS EVALUATED ON SELF RATED FEAR, ANXIETY, SADNESS AND DISTURBED SLEEP IN 47 SURVIVORS IN THE ANDAMAN ISLANDS. POLYGRAPH RECORDINGS OF THE HEART RATE, BREATH RATE AND SKIN RESISTANCE WERE ALSO MADE. AMONG THE 47 PEOPLE, 31 WERE SETTLERS FROM THE MAINLAND (I.E. INDIA, ML GROUP) AND 16 WERE ENDOGENOUS PEOPLE (EP GROUP). THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN SELF RATED FEAR, ANXIETY, SADNESS AND DISTURBED SLEEP IN BOTH GROUPS, AND IN THE HEART AND BREATH RATE IN THE ML GROUP, AND IN THE BREATH RATE ALONE IN THE EP GROUP, FOLLOWING YOGA (P < 0.05, T-TEST). THIS SUGGESTS THAT YOGA PRACTICE MAY BE USEFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF STRESS FOLLOWING A NATURAL DISASTER IN PEOPLE WITH WIDELY DIFFERING SOCIAL, CULTURAL AND SPIRITUAL BELIEFS.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
12 2918  26 [THE EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA EXERCISES ON STRESS AND ANXIETY LEVELS IN MASTECTOMIZED WOMEN]. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA ON STRESS AND ANXIETY LEVELS IN MASTECTOMIZED WOMEN. IT ALSO INVESTIGATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE LEVELS WITH THE FOLLOWING VARIABLES: AGE; MARITAL STATUS; RELIGION; INSTRUCTION; PROFESSION; SMOKE ADDICTION; ELITISM; STAGING OF THE DISEASE; AND TREATMENT PHASE. THIS INVOLVED CONTROLLED RANDOM CLINICAL TRIAL SAMPLING OF 45 MASTECTOMIZED WOMEN TREATED AT THE ILZA BIANCO OUTPATIENT SERVICE OF SANTA RITA DE CASSIA HOSPITAL IN THE BRAZILIAN STATE OF ESPIRITO SANTO FROM MARCH TO NOVEMBER 2010. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PARTICIPATED IN 6 INDIVIDUALLY-APPLIED SESSIONS WITH INCENTIVE FOR ONGOING HOME PRACTICE AND WAS RE-EVALUATED AFTER THE PERIOD, WHEREAS THE CONTROL GROUP WAS RE-EVALUATED AFTER A PROPORTIONAL PERIOD. FOR THE STUDY OF THE VARIABLES, THE INTERVIEW AND RECORDING ON A FORM TECHNIQUE WAS USED, ALONG WITH THE ANXIETY TRAIT AND STATE TEST, AND THE STRESS SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS TEST. FOR STATISTICAL TREATMENT, THE STATISTICAL PACK FOR SOCIAL SCIENCES WAS USED. THE DATA ARE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AND HAVE SHOWN THAT HATHA YOGA EXERCISES DECREASE STRESS AND ANXIETY IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP. NO CONNECTION BETWEEN CONFOUNDING VARIABLES AND ANXIETY AND STRESS LEVELS WAS FOUND.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
13 1019  33 EFFECTS OF WEEKLY ONE-HOUR HATHA YOGA THERAPY ON RESILIENCE AND STRESS LEVELS IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA-SPECTRUM DISORDERS: AN EIGHT-WEEK RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA THERAPY ON RESILIENCE, BRAIN-DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR (BDNF) LEVELS, AND SALIVARY ALPHA AMYLASE (SAA) ACTIVITY IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA-SPECTRUM DISORDERS. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: SINGLE-BLINDED, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY IN WHICH OUTPATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA OR RELATED PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS (ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES, 10TH REVISION) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A YOGA OR A CONTROL GROUP. SETTING: NOVEMBER 2012-APRIL 2013 AT YAMANASHI PREFECTURAL KITA HOSPITAL, JAPAN. INTERVENTIONS: IN THE YOGA GROUP, PATIENTS RECEIVED WEEKLY 1-HOUR HATHA YOGA SESSIONS, IN ADDITION TO REGULAR TREATMENT, FOR 8 WEEKS. THOSE IN THE CONTROL GROUP UNDERWENT REGULAR TREATMENT, WHICH INCLUDED A DAYCARE REHABILITATION PROGRAM. OUTCOME MEASURES: ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED THE 25-ITEM RESILIENCE SCALE (RS), POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SYNDROME SCALE (PANSS), PLASMA AND SALIVARY BDNF LEVEL, AND SAA ACTIVITY. RESULTS: FIFTY PATIENTS PARTICIPATED (25 IN EACH GROUP; MEAN AGE+/-STANDARD DEVIATION, 50.9+/-11.3 YEARS; MEAN DURATION OF ILLNESS, 25.0+/-10.3 YEARS; MEAN TOTAL PANSS SCORE, 78.2+/-17.3). NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN CHANGES IN ANY VARIABLE FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 8 WERE FOUND BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS (CHANGES IN THE YOGA GROUP VERSUS THE CONTROL GROUP: RS SCORE, -1.6+/-19.9 VERSUS 0.3+/-17.2; PANSS SCORE, 0.5+/-12.0 VERSUS 5.0+/-15.6; PLASMA BDNF, 41.6+/-377.0 PG/DL VERSUS 73.4+/-346.0 PG/DL; SAA, -26.2+/-72.6 KU/L VERSUS -13.8+/-68.0 KU/L, RESPECTIVELY). CONCLUSIONS: ADJUNCT YOGA THERAPY SHOWED NO POSITIVE CHANGES IN RESILIENCE LEVEL OR STRESS MARKERS. DURATION AND INTENSITY OF YOGA SESSIONS AND THE FOCUS ON PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC ILLNESS MAY EXPLAIN THE NEGATIVE OBSERVATIONS IN LIGHT OF PAST POSITIVE EVIDENCE REGARDING YOGA THERAPY.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                      
14  738  39 EFFECT OF RAJA YOGA MEDITATION ON PSYCHOLOGICAL AND FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES IN SPINAL CORD INJURY PATIENTS. BACKGROUND: SPINAL CORD INJURY (SCI) IS A DEBILITATING DISORDER WITH DYSFUNCTION IN DAILY ACTIVITIES AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES LIKE ANXIETY AS WELL AS DEPRESSION IMPACTING THE QUALITY OF LIFE SUBSTANTIALLY. EXISTING TREATMENTS FOCUS MAINLY ON REHABILITATION, SYMPTOM REDUCTION, AND SECONDARY COMPLICATIONS. HOWEVER, PSYCHOLOGICAL, SOCIAL, AND EXISTENTIAL ISSUES ARE LEAST ADDRESSED IN THE PREVAILING MODELS. AIMS: TO STUDY THE ROLE OF MEDITATION IN ADDRESSING PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPAIRMENT AND ANY RESULTANT IMPROVEMENT IN FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES IN SCI PATIENTS. METHODS: NONRANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN A TERTIARY CARE CENTER FOR SCI PATIENTS. HOSPITAL INPATIENTS WERE RECRUITED INTO EITHER EXPERIMENTAL INTERVENTION GROUP (ADD ON EASY RAJA YOGA WITH CONVENTIONAL REHABILITATION-ER N = 50) OR CONTROL INTERVENTION GROUP (CONVENTIONAL REHABILITATION ALONE-CR N = 50). PATIENTS IN THE ER GROUP RECEIVED EASY RAJA YOGA FOR 1 MONTH, ALONG WITH CONVENTIONAL REHABILITATION AND THE CR GROUP PATIENTS RECEIVED ONLY CONVENTIONAL REHABILITATION. ALL THE SUBJECTS WERE ASSESSED FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL (PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE [PSS], HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE [HADS]) AND FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT (SPINAL CORD INDEPENDENCE MEASURE (SCIM), NUMERIC PAIN RATING (NPR) AND WHO QUALITY OF LIFE-BRIEF (WHOQOLBREF)] AT BASELINE AND AFTER 1 MONTH. RESULTS: AFTER 1 MONTH OF ADD-ON EASY RAJA YOGA, THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE SCORES OF HADS (F[1,88] = 272.92, P < 0.001), PSS (F[1,88] = 274.41, P < 0.001) AND NPR (F[1,88] = 60.60, P < 0.001) AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE SCORES OF WHOQOLBREF (F[1,88] = 349.94, P < 0.001) AND SCIM (F[1,88] = 29.09, P < 0.001) IN THE ER GROUP COMPARED TO CR GROUP IN ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE. CONCLUSION: ONE-MONTH ADD-ON EASY RAJA YOGA IMPROVES PSYCHOLOGICAL AND FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES (HADS, PSS, NPR, WHOQOLBREF AND SCIM) IN PATIENTS WITH SCI. FUTURE STUDIES WITH ROBUST DESIGNS ARE NEEDED TO VALIDATE THE RESULTS.	2021	
                                                                                                         
15  295  35 AGE RELATED DIFFERENCES OF SELECTED HATHA YOGA PRACTICES ON ANTHROPOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS, MUSCULAR STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY OF HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS. BACKGROUND: PHYSIOLOGICAL BENEFITS OF YOGA ON VOLUNTEERS OF A PARTICULAR AGE GROUP ARE AVAILABLE. HOWEVER, REPORTS ON EFFICACY OF A SPECIFIC YOGA PACKAGE ON THE POPULACE OF DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS FROM SIMILAR OCCUPATIONAL BACKGROUND IS STILL VERY LIMITED. THEREFORE, THE PRESENT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO APPRAISE THE EFFECT OF A SPECIFIC HATHA YOGA PACKAGE ON ANTHROPOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS, FLEXIBILITY AND MUSCULAR STRENGTH OF HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS OF DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS FROM SIMILAR OCCUPATIONAL TRADE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 71 PARTICIPANTS (GROUP ALL) FROM INDIAN AIR FORCE GROUND PERSONNEL VOLUNTEERED AND AGE WISE DIVIDED INTO 3 GROUPS - (I) GROUP I (GR. - I) (N1 = 27, 20-29 YEARS), (II) GROUP II (GR. - II) (N2 = 21, 30-39 YEARS) AND (III) GROUP III (GR. - III) (N3 = 23, 40-49 YEARS). ALL THE PARTICIPANTS UNDERGONE SELECTED HATHA YOGA TRAINING FOR 1 H DAILY FOR A PERIOD OF 12 WEEKS. PARAMETERS WERE RECORDED BEFORE AND AFTER THE TRAINING. PRE AND POST TRAINING DIFFERENCES WERE ASSESSED BY STUDENT'S T-TEST. RESULTS: BODY WEIGHT (ALL, GR. - II AND GR. - III [ALL P < 0.05]), BODY MASS INDEX (GR. - II AND GR. - III [BOTH P < 0.01]) AND FAT% (GR. - II AND III [BOTH P < 0.05]) WERE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. NECK CIRCUMFERENCE WAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN GR. - I (P < 0.05) BUT DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN GR. - III (P < 0.05). CHEST CIRCUMFERENCE (ALL (P < 0.001), IN GR. - I AND II [BOTH P < 0.05]), GRIP STRENGTH (ALL [LEFT: P < 0.01 AND RIGHT: P < 0.05], IN GR. - I [LEFT: P < 0.05 AND RIGHT: P < 0.01], IN GR. - II [RIGHT: P < 0.05] AND IN GR. - III [LEFT: P < 0.05 AND RIGHT: P < 0.01]), BACK LEG STRENGTH (GROUP WISE P < 0.001, P < 0.05, P < 0.01 AND P < 0.05 RESPECTIVELY) AND FLEXIBILITY (ALL P < 0.001) WERE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION: HATHA YOGA CAN IMPROVE ANTHROPOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS, MUSCULAR STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY AMONG VOLUNTEERS OF DIFFERENT AGE GROUP AND CAN ALSO BE HELPFUL IN PREVENTING AND ATTENUATING AGE RELATED DETERIORATION OF THESE PARAMETERS.	2015	

16 1571  32 MANAGEMENT OF MYOFASCIAL PAIN DYSFUNCTION SYNDROME WITH MEDITATION AND YOGA: HEALING THROUGH NATURAL THERAPY. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY WERE TO STUDY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RAJ-YOGA MEDITATION AND PRANAYAMA IN PATIENTS WITH MYOFASCIAL PAIN DYSFUNCTION SYNDROME (MPDS) AND COMPARED THE EFFECTS WITH ONGOING CONVENTIONAL NONINVASIVE TREATMENT MODALITIES. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE STUDY COMPRISED 30 PATIENTS DIVIDED EQUALLY (10 EACH) INTO 3 GROUP, I.E., CONTROL GROUP (CONVENTIONAL, NONINVASIVE TREATMENT), EXPERIMENTAL A GROUP (CONVENTIONAL, NONINVASIVE TREATMENT WITH RAJ-YOGA MEDITATION THERAPY AND PRANAYAMA), AND EXPERIMENTAL B GROUP (RAJ-YOGA MEDITATION THERAPY AND PRANAYAMA ONLY). PARAMETERS SUCH AS PAIN, MOUTH OPENING, MANDIBULAR DEVIATION, INFLAMMATION, SWELLING, CLICKING, OCCLUSION, AND PSYCHOLOGIC EVALUATION SUCH AS ANXIETY, STRESS, AND DEPRESSION WERE ASSESSED BEFORE THE START OF THE STUDY AND AT WEEKLY INTERVALS FOR 3 MONTHS. RESULTS: POSTTREATMENT PAIN AND INFLAMMATION IMPROVED BOTH IN THE CONTROL GROUP AND EXPERIMENTAL A GROUP, BUT STATISTICALLY IT IS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT IN THE EXPERIMENTAL A GROUP. FURTHERMORE, IT IS EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY AS WELL AS FOR A LONG PERIOD IN EXPERIMENTAL A GROUP. IMPROVEMENT IN MOUTH OPENING WAS STATISTICALLY HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT IN CONTROL GROUP BUT NOT IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS. POSTTREATMENT ANXIETY AND STRESS STATUS WAS IMPROVED WITH STATISTICALLY HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT RESULT IN THE EXPERIMENTAL A AND B. THE POSTTREATMENT DEPRESSION STATUS ALONG WITH MANDIBULAR DEVIATION, SWELLING, CLICKING, AND OCCLUSION HAS NOT IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY IN ANY OF THE GROUPS. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION: RAJ-YOGA MEDITATION AND PRANAYAMA IN COMBINATION WITH CONVENTIONAL, NONINVASIVE, TREATMENT MODALITIES SHOWED PROMISING RESULTS IN MPDS PATIENTS AS COMPARED TO EITHER MODALITIES ALONE.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
17 1009  42 EFFECTS OF MULTIMODAL MANDALA YOGA ON SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL SKILLS FOR YOUTH WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER: AN EXPLORATORY STUDY. CONTEXT: YOUTH WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (ASD) DEMONSTRATES IMPAIRMENT IN THE ABILITY TO SOCIALLY AND EMOTIONALLY RELATE TO OTHERS THAT CAN LIMIT PARTICIPATION IN GROUPS, INTERACTION WITH PEERS, AND BUILDING SUCCESSFUL LIFE RELATIONSHIPS. AIMS: THE AIM OF THIS EXPLORATORY STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF A NOVEL MULTIMODAL MANDALA YOGA PROGRAM ON SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL SKILLS FOR YOUTH WITH ASD. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: FIVE MALES WITH ASD ATTENDED 1 H YOGA SESSIONS, TWICE A WEEK FOR 4 WEEKS. MULTIMODAL MANDALA YOGA COMPRISED 26 CIRCULAR PARTNER/GROUP POSES, COLOR AND TRACING SHEETS, RHYTHMIC CHANTING, YOGA CARDS, AND GAMES. TREATMENT AND RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR ASD SOCIAL SKILLS ASSESSMENT (TSSA) SCORES WERE COLLECTED BEFORE AND AFTER THE EIGHT YOGA SESSIONS. THE MODIFIED FACIAL MOOD SCALE (MFMS) WAS USED TO OBSERVE MOOD CHANGES BEFORE AND AFTER EACH YOGA CLASS. PAIRED SAMPLE T-TESTS WERE CONDUCTED ON TSSA AND MFMS SCORES TO COMPARE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL DIFFERENCES POST THE 4-WEEK CAMP. NARRATIVE FIELD NOTES WERE DOCUMENTED AFTER EACH OF THE EIGHT YOGA SESSIONS. RESULTS: A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT FROM PRE- TO POST-TEST WAS FOUND IN OVERALL TSSA (T(4) = -5.744, P = 0.005) AND ON RESPONDENT TO INITIATION (T(4) = -3.726, P = 0.020), INITIATING INTERACTION (T(4) = -8.5, P = 0.039), AND AFFECTIVE UNDERSTANDING AND PERSPECTIVE TAKING SUBSCALES (T(4) = -5.171 P = 0.007). YOUTH'S MFMS SCORES INCREASED FROM 80% TO 100% AT THE END OF EIGHT YOGA SESSIONS DEMONSTRATING A PLEASANT OR POSITIVE MOOD. THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF THE NARRATIVE NOTES IDENTIFIED THREE KEY FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE YOGA EXPERIENCE: (A) ENHANCED MOOD AND EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION, (B) INCREASED EMPATHY TOWARD OTHERS, AND (C) IMPROVED TEAMWORK SKILLS. CONCLUSION: THIS MULTIMODAL MANDALA YOGA TRAINING HAS IMPLICATION FOR DEVELOPING POSITIVE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL SKILLS FOR YOUTH WITH ASD.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                    
18 2396  13 YOGA AND CHEMOREFLEX RESPONSE TO HYPOXIA AND HYPERCAPNIA. WE TESTED WHETHER CHEMOREFLEX SENSITIVITY COULD BE AFFECTED BY THE PRACTICE OF YOGA, AND WHETHER THIS IS SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF A SLOW BREATHING RATE OBTAINED DURING YOGA OR AS A GENERAL CONSEQUENCE OF YOGA. WE FOUND THAT SLOW BREATHING RATE PER SE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED CHEMOREFLEX SENSITIVITY, BUT LONG-TERM YOGA PRACTICE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR A GENERALISED REDUCTION IN CHEMOREFLEX.	2000	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
19 1277  38 FUNCTIONAL STATUS IN ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS - YOGA VS. PHYSIOTHERAPY: A QUASI EXPERIMENTAL STUDY. OBJECTIVES: ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS RESULTS IN A MULTIDIMENSIONAL DISABILITY WHICH DEMANDS A POLYGONAL APPROACH. ALTHOUGH PHYSIOTHERAPY PROVES AN ESSENTIAL FOR A COMPLETE AND COMPREHENSIVE RECOVERY IN ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS, EVIDENCE ALSO SUGGEST THE ROLE OF YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT, HENCE THIS STUDY INVESTIGATE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS. METHODS: THIS IS A QUASI-RANDOMISED CONTROL STUDY. A PRE-DIAGNOSED SUBACUTE AND CHRONIC ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS OF SHOULDER, BETWEEN THE AGE GROUP OF 35-60 YEARS OF BOTH GENDERS OF TOTAL 40 PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO GROUP 'A' (YOGASANA) AND GROUP 'B' (PHYSIOTHERAPY). THE PARAMETERS OF PAIN, JOINT MOBILITY AND FUNCTIONAL DISABILITIES WERE MEASURED AT THE BASELINE AND AFTER FOUR-WEEKS. RESULTS: THE MEAN AGE OF GROUP 'A' WAS 45.4 +/- 7.78 YEARS WHEREAS 50.05 +/- 5.98 YEARS WAS IN GROUP 'B'. INTRAGROUP ANALYSIS FOR BOTH THE GROUPS SHOWED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ALL THE STUDY VARIABLES. WHEREAS IN INTERGROUP ANALYSIS YOGASANA WAS FOUND TO BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IN IMPROVING SHOULDER ABDUCTION MOBILITY, P=0.03, EFFECT SIZE R=0.35 AND ALSO IN SHOULDER FLEXION (P=0.15, R=0.23) AND SHOULDER INTERNAL ROTATION (P=0.07, R=0.3), THOUGH STATISTICALLY NOT SIGNIFICANT, IN VIEW OF SMALL EFFECT SIZE RESPONSE. CONCLUSIONS: BOTH TECHNIQUES IMPROVED THE FUNCTIONAL STATUS IN ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS, HOWEVER ADDITIONAL EFFECTS ON JOINT MOBILITY WAS DEMONSTRATED BY YOGASANA.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
20 2747  28 YOGA PRACTICE IN DIABETES IMPROVES PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES. BACKGROUND: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICE ON CLINICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES IN SUBJECTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM). METHODS: IN A 40-DAY YOGA CAMP AT THE INSTITUTE OF YOGA AND CONSCIOUSNESS, AMBULATORY SUBJECTS WITH T2DM NOT HAVING SIGNIFICANT COMPLICATIONS (N = 35) PARTICIPATED IN A 40-DAY YOGA CAMP, WHERE YOGIC PRACTICES WERE OVERSEEN BY TRAINED YOGA TEACHERS. CLINICAL, BIOCHEMICAL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING WERE STUDIED AT BASELINE AND AT THE END OF THE CAMP. RESULTS: AT THE END OF THE STUDY, THERE WAS A REDUCTION OF BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) (26.514 +/- 3.355 TO 25.771 +/- 3.40; P < 0.001) AND ANXIETY (6.20 +/- 3.72 TO 4.29 +/- 4.46; P < 0.05) AND AN IMPROVEMENT IN TOTAL GENERAL WELL-BEING (48.6 +/- 11.13 TO 52.66 +/- 52.66 +/- 12.87; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: PARTICIPATION OF SUBJECTS WITH T2DM IN YOGA PRACTICE FOR 40 DAYS RESULTED IN REDUCED BMI, IMPROVED WELL-BEING, AND REDUCED ANXIETY.	2009

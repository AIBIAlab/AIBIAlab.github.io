1  519 124 COMPARING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA & ORAL CALCIUM ADMINISTRATION IN ALLEVIATING SYMPTOMS OF PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME IN MEDICAL UNDERGRADUATES. INTRODUCTION: MEDICAL UNDERGRADUATES ARE HEAVILY BURDENED BY THEIR CURRICULUM. THE FEMALES, IN ADDITION, SUFFER FROM VIVID AFFECTIVE OR SOMATIC PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME (PMS) SYMPTOMS SUCH AS BLOATING, MASTALGIA, INSOMNIA, FATIGUE, MOOD SWINGS, IRRITABILITY, AND DEPRESSION. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS PROPOSED TO ATTENUATE THE SYMPTOMS OF PMS BY SIMPLE LIFESTYLE MEASURES LIKE YOGA AND/OR ORAL CALCIUM. METHODS: 65 MEDICAL FEMALE STUDENTS (18-22 YEARS) WITH A REGULAR MENSTRUAL CYCLE WERE ASKED TO SELF-RATE THEIR SYMPTOMS, ALONG WITH THEIR SEVERITY, IN A VALIDATED QUESTIONNAIRE FOR TWO CONSECUTIVE MENSTRUAL CYCLES. FIFTY-EIGHT STUDENTS WERE FOUND TO HAVE PMS. TWENTY GIRLS WERE GIVEN YOGA TRAINING (45 MINUTES DAILY, FIVE DAYS A WEEK, FOR THREE MONTHS). ANOTHER GROUP OF 20 WAS GIVEN ORAL TABLETS OF CALCIUM CARBONATE DAILY (500 MG, FOR THREE MONTHS) AND REST 18 GIRL SERVED AS CONTROL GROUP. DATA WERE ANALYZED BY SPSS VER.13 SOFTWARE. RESULTS: THE YOGA AND CALCIUM GROUPS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN NUMBER AND SEVERITY OF PREMENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS WHEREAS IN THE CONTROL GROUP THERE WAS NOT THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE. CONCLUSION: ENCOURAGING A REGULAR PRACTICE OF YOGA OR TAKING A TABLET OF CALCIUM DAILY IN THE MEDICAL SCHOOLS CAN DECREASE THE SYMPTOMS OF PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
2 2303  39 TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA ON PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME. BACKGROUND: EIGHTY PERCENT OF WOMEN DURING THEIR REPRODUCTIVE AGE EXPERIENCE SOME SYMPTOMS ATTRIBUTED TO PREMENSTRUAL PHASE OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE. PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME (PMS) IS CHARACTERIZED BY EMOTIONAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS THAT OCCUR DURING LATE LUTEAL PHASE OF MENSTRUAL CYCLE AND ARE RELIEVED AFTER THE ONSET OF MENSTRUATION. AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA ARE ONE OF THE WAYS TO REDUCE THESE SYMPTOMS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA ON PMS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 72 PARTICIPANTS OF PMS, REFERRED FOR PHYSIOTHERAPY TREATMENT (MEAN AGE 28 YEARS), WERE ENROLLED AND ALLOCATED INTO TWO GROUPS (GROUP A AND B) BY SIMPLE COMPUTERIZED RANDOMIZATION. PATIENTS IN GROUP A RECEIVED AEROBIC EXERCISE AND IN GROUP B RECEIVED YOGA MOVEMENTS FOR 40 MIN, 3 TIMES A WEEK FOR 1 MONTH. THE PAIN INTENSITY (VISUAL ANALOG SCALE) AND PMS SCALE WERE MEASURED BEFORE, AT THE END OF 15 DAYS, AND 1 MONTH OF TREATMENT PROGRAM. RESULTS: DATA WERE ANALYZED BY PAIRED T-TEST, UNPAIRED T-TEST, AND ONE-WAY ANOVA; AND THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT BOTH AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA MOVEMENTS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED PAIN INTENSITY AND PMS SYMPTOMS. SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PMS SYMPTOMS WAS FOUND IN PATIENTS TREATED WITH YOGA COMPARED TO AEROBIC EXERCISE; HOWEVER, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND IN PAIN INTENSITY BETWEEN THESE TWO GROUPS (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: IT IS CONCLUDED THAT BOTH AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA MOVEMENTS ARE EFFECTIVE IN TREATING PMS; HOWEVER, YOGA IS MORE EFFECTIVE IN RELIEVING THE SYMPTOMS OF PMS THAN AEROBIC EXERCISE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
3 2737  40 YOGA POSITIVELY AFFECTED DEPRESSION AND BLOOD PRESSURE IN WOMEN WITH PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL. WOMEN WITH PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME (PMS) OFTEN COMPLAIN ABOUT DEPRESSION WHEN THEIR MENSTRUAL CYCLE BEGINS. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON WOMEN WITH PMS SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION DURING MENSTRUAL CYCLE. METHODS: THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED FROM APRIL TO OCTOBER 2015 IN TABRIZ, IRAN. ALL SUBJECTS (20-45 YEARS OLD), WHO WERE FREQUENTLY REFERRED TO THE PRIVATE OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY CLINICS, WERE INITIALLY MONITORED FOR PMS AND DEPRESSION. SUBJECTS COMPLETED THE DEMOGRAPHIC AND BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY-II (BDI-II) QUESTIONNAIRES BEFORE AND AFTER INTERVENTION. IN ADDITION, SUBJECTS WERE MONITORED FOR ELIGIBLE AND INELIGIBLE CRITERIA. IN THIS STUDY 62 SUBJECTS WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED FOR THE YOGA GROUP AND CONTROL GROUPS. SUBJECTS PRACTICED YOGA OVER TWO MONTHS IN THREE SESSIONS, THE DURATION OF EACH SESSION WAS 60MIN. RESULTS: THE GENERAL SCORE OF THE DEPRESSION AFTER YOGA INTERVENTION WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP (P<0.036) AND YOGA GROUP BEFORE INTERVENTION (P<0.001). THE DIASTOLIC PRESSURE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER YOGA INTERVENTION (P<0.029). YOGA DECREASED THE STATE OF DEPRESSION AND DIASTOLIC PRESSURE OF THE SUBJECTS WITH PMS COMPLAINING FROM DEPRESSION. CONCLUSION: WE CONCLUDE THAT YOGA HAS STRONG EFFECTS ON DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AND BLOOD PRESSURE, THEREFORE IT CAN BE USED AS A COMPLEMENTARY OR ALTERNATIVE REMEDY FOR PMS PATIENTS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
4  766  36 EFFECT OF THREE YOGA POSES (COBRA, CAT AND FISH POSES) IN WOMEN WITH PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA: A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: WE HAVE EVALUATED THE CLINICAL EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA. PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA OCCURS IN 50% OF FEMALE ADOLESCENTS AND IS A COMMON PROBLEM IN WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE. WE HAVE ASSESSED WHETHER THREE YOGA POSES (COBRA, CAT, AND FISH POSES) ARE ABLE TO REDUCE SEVERITY AND DURATION OF PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA. METHODS: TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN ADOLESCENTS WITH PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA, 92 GIRL STUDENTS,18-22 YEARS OLD, WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO AN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (N = 50) AND A CONTROL GROUP (N = 42). THE VISUAL ANALOG SCALE FOR PAIN WAS USED TO ASSESS INTENSITY OF PAIN AND THE PAIN DURATION WAS CALCULATED IN TERMS OF HOURS. EACH GROUP WAS EVALUATED FOR THREE MENSTRUAL CYCLES. AT FIRST CYCLE NO METHOD WAS PRESENTED; THE PARTICIPANTS ONLY WERE ASKED TO COMPLETE THE QUESTIONNAIRE OF MENSTRUAL CHARACTERISTICS DURING THEIR MENSTRUAL. THEN THE PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED BY THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP TO DO YOGA POSES AT LUTEAL PHASE, AND ALSO TO COMPLETE THE MENSTRUAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE IN DURING OF MENSTRUATION. THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT RECEIVE ANY INTERVENTION EXCEPT TO COMPLETE MENSTRUAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE IN DURING OF MENSTRUATION. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE PAIN INTENSITY AND PAIN DURATION IN THE POST-TESTS COMPARED WITH THE PRETEST IN YOGA GROUP (P < 0.05). THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE PAIN INTENSITY AND PAIN DURATION IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: YOGA REDUCED THE SEVERITY AND DURATION OF PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA POSES ARE SAFE AND SIMPLE TREATMENT FOR PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA.	2011	
                                                                                          
5 1823  34 PSYCHO-BIOLOGICAL CHANGES WITH ADD ON YOGA NIDRA IN PATIENTS WITH MENSTRUAL DISORDERS: A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: MENSTRUAL DISORDERS ARE COMMON PROBLEMS AMONG WOMEN IN THE REPRODUCTIVE AGE GROUP. YUGA INTERVENTIONS MAY DECREASE THE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS RELATED TO MENSTRUAL DISORDERS. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS AIMED TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF YOGA NIDRA ON PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS IN PATIENTS WITH MENSTRUAL DISORDERS. METHODS: A TOTAL NUMBER OF 100 WOMEN RECRUITED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY AND WERE THEN RANDOMLY ALLOCATED INTO TWO GROUPS: A) INTERVENTION RECEIVED YOGIC INTERVENTION AND MEDICATION FOR 6 MONTH, AND B) CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED NO YOGIC INTERVENTION AND THEY ONLY RECEIVED PRESCRIBED MEDICATION). PSYCHOLOGICAL GENERAL WELL-BEING INDEX (PGWBI) AND HORMONAL PROFILE WERE ASSESSED AT THE TIME OF BEFORE AND AFTER SIX MONTHS ON BOTH GROUPS. RESULTS: THE MEAN SCORE OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, POSITIVE WELL-BEING, GENERAL HEALTH, AND VITALITY SCORES, AS WELL AS HORMONAL LEVELS, IN POSTTEST WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT IN INTERVENTION GROUP AS COMPARED WITH PRETEST. BUT THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: YOGA NIDRA CAN BE A SUCCESSFUL THERAPY TO OVERCOME THE PSYCHIATRIC MORBIDITY ASSOCIATED WITH MENSTRUAL IRREGULARITIES. THEREFORE, YOGIC RELAXATION TRAINING (YOGA NIDRA) COULD BE PRESCRIBED AS AN ADJUNCT TO CONVENTIONAL DRUG THERAPY FOR MENSTRUAL DYSFUNCTION.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
6 2044  29 THE ACUTE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON COGNITIVE MEASURES FOR WOMEN WITH PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME. OBJECTIVES: RECENTLY, YOGA CLASSES SPECIFICALLY FOR WOMEN WITH PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME (PMS) HAVE INCREASED, BUT THERE IS LITTLE RESEARCH ABOUT THE EFFICACY OF THESE CLASSES. THE PRIMARY AIMS OF THIS STUDY WERE TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA EXERCISE ON WOMEN WITH PMS AND TO EVALUATE THE IMMEDIATE CHANGE OF ATTENTION PERFORMANCE AFTER YOGA CLASSES. METHODS: THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE ATTENTION TASK RESULTS OF WOMEN WITH PMS. ELEVEN WOMEN WITH PMS AND 9 WOMEN WITHOUT PMS WERE RECRUITED. THE PMS GROUP TOOK THE TESTS BEFORE AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE YOGA CLASS BOTH IN THE LUTEAL AND FOLLICULAR PHASE OF ONE MENSTRUAL CYCLE, WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP TOOK THE TESTS ONLY TWICE: ONCE IN THE LUTEAL PHASE AND ONCE IN THE FOLLICULAR PHASE. BOTH GROUPS WERE REQUIRED TO FINISH RESTING ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY (EEG) AND COGNITIVE TASK OF THE 2-BACK TASK WITH EEG RECORDING. RESULTS: THE ALPHA BRAIN WAVE PERCENTAGE WAS HIGHER IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOGA EXERCISE IN THE PMS GROUP. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE PARTICIPANTS FELT MORE RELAXED OR WERE IN A MORE PEACEFUL MENTAL CONDITION AFTER YOGA EXERCISE. IN THE 2-BACK TASK, THE PMS GROUP NEEDED A LONGER REACTION TIME TO RESPOND TO THE TARGET STIMULUS IN THE LUTEAL PHASE AND PERFORMED BETTER WITH HIGHER ACCURACY AND SHORTER REACTION TIME AFTER YOGA EXERCISE. THE EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS OF THE EEG RECORDING DISPLAYED A SIGNIFICANT VARIABILITY AT THE P3 AMPLITUDE THROUGHOUT THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE IN THE PMS GROUP, BUT THE P3 AMPLITUDE WAS UNCHANGED THROUGHOUT THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE IN THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT WOMEN WITH PMS COULD ATTEND SHORT-TERM YOGA EXERCISE IN THE LUTEAL PHASE TO MAKE THEMSELVES FEEL BETTER AND MAINTAIN A BETTER ATTENTION LEVEL.	2015	
                                                                                         
7 2136  27 THE EFFECTS OF ACUPRESSURE AND YOGA FOR COPING WITH PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROMES ON PREMENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMS TO IDENTIFY THE EFFECTS OF ACUPRESSURE AND YOGA FOR COPING WITH PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROMES (PMS) ON THE PREMENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE. METHODS: THIS STUDY ADOPTED A RANDOMIZED INTERVENTION DESIGN WITH A PRETEST-POSTTEST CONTROL GROUP. THE SAMPLE CONSISTED OF 155 STUDENTS WITH PMS COMPLAINTS (50 IN YOGA, 51 IN ACUPRESSURE, AND 54 IN CONTROL GROUP). THE STUDENTS IN THE INTERVENTION GROUPS DID YOGA AND RECEIVED ACUPRESSURE THROUGHOUT 12 WEEKS. RESULTS: IT WAS FOUND THAT THE PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME SCALE POSTTEST MEAN SCORE OF THE STUDENTS WAS LOWER, AND THE PHYSICAL HEALTH, PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH, AND ENVIRONMENT SUB-SCALE MEAN SCORES OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE WERE HIGHER IN THE YOGA GROUP IN COMPARISON TO THE OTHER GROUPS (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: YOGA WAS FOUND TO BE A MORE EFFECTIVE NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL METHOD FOR COPING WITH PREMENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
8  852  25 EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE MENSTRUAL PAIN, PHYSICAL FITNESS, AND QUALITY OF LIFE OF YOUNG WOMEN WITH PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA. THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE EFFECT OF SPECIALLY DESIGNED YOGA PROGRAM ON THE MENSTRUAL PAIN, PHYSICAL FITNESS, AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) OF NON-ATHLETE WOMEN WITH PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA (PD) AGED 18-22 YEARS. THIRTY-FOUR VOLUNTEERS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED INTO CONTROL AND YOGA GROUPS. MENSTRUAL PAIN, PHYSICAL FITNESS, AND QOL WERE EVALUATED AT BASELINE AND AT THE END OF THE 12-WEEK STUDY PERIOD. THE YOGA GROUP WAS ASKED TO PRACTICE YOGA FOR 30 MIN PER DAY, TWICE A WEEK, FOR 12 WEEKS AT HOME, WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT RECEIVE ANY FORM OF EXERCISE OVER THE STUDY PERIOD. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVE IN MENSTRUAL PAIN, PHYSICAL FITNESS, AND QOL IN THE YOGA GROUP MORE THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. THEREFORE, THIS SPECIALLY DESIGNED YOGA PROGRAM MAY BE A POSSIBLE COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR PD.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
9 1080  30 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF SLEEP OF WOMEN WITH PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME. OBJECTIVE: WOMEN WITH PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME (PMS) COMMONLY COMPLAIN OF SLEEP DISTURBANCES, SPECIFICALLY IN THE LUTEAL PHASE OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE. THEREFORE, THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF SLEEP OF WOMEN EXPERIENCING PMS WAS INVESTIGATED. MATERIAL AND METHODS: WOMEN (AGED 20-45 Y) MONITORED FOR PMS, WHO WERE REFERRED TO THE PRIVATE OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY CLINICS IN TABRIZ, IRAN, WERE REFERRED TO THE PRIVATE OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY CLINICS IN TABRIZ, IRAN. AFTERWARD, 62 WOMEN, WERE SELECTED AND DIVIDED INTO 2 GROUPS, RANDOMLY: 31 SUBJECTS IN YOGA THE YOGA GROUP AND 31 IN THE CONTROL GROUP. SUBJECTS IN YOGA PERFORMED FOR 10 WK IN 3 SESSIONS, WITH EACH SESSION LASTING 60 MIN. SUBJECTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT PERFORM ANY YOGA. SUBJECTS COMPLETED A DEMOGRAPHIC QUESTIONNAIRE AND THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX QUESTIONNAIRE BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA IN BOTH GROUPS. RESULTS: AFTER YOGA INTERVENTION, SUBJECTS SIGNIFICANTLY EXPRESSED IMPROVEMENT IN SLEEPING (P < .05). BASED ON THE MANN-WHITNEY U TEST, A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED IN THE SUBDOMAINS OF BOTH GROUPS ON QUALITY OF SLEEP (P < .01), SLEEP LATENCY (P < .01), AND SLEEP EFFICIENCY (P < .05). CONCLUSION: YOGA REDUCED THE DISTURBANCES OF SLEEP IN THE SUBJECTS WITH PMS, WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY IMPROVED THE EFFICIENCY OF THEIR SLEEP. THEREFORE, WE CONCLUDE THAT YOGA CAN BE PRESCRIBED FOR IMPROVING SLEEP DISTURBANCES IN WOMEN WITH PMS AND MEDICAL THERAPY WILL PROBABLY BE NEEDED IN SEVERE SITUATIONS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
10 2107  32 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON PAIN LEVEL IN PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA. THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON PAIN LEVELS IN FEMALE STUDENTS WITH PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA. THIS STUDY IS A RANDOMIZED EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WITH CONTROL GROUP AND PRETEST POST-TEST PRACTICE. THIS STUDY INCLUDED 60 VOLUNTEER FEMALE STUDENTS (30 EXPERIMENTAL AND 30 CONTROL GROUPS). THE PATIENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP TOOK PART IN THE YOGA PROGRAM A TOTAL OF 12 SESSIONS, ONCE PER WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS. "PERSONAL INFORMATION FORM", "VISUAL ANALOG SKALA (VAS)" AND "DYSMENORRHEA MONITORING FORM (DMF)" WERE USED IN DATA COLLECTION PROCESS. TO MEASURE DYSMENORRHEA PAIN, THE STUDENTS WERE REQUESTED TO MARK A NUMBER BETWEEN 1 AND 10 ON THE VAS SCALE ACCORDING TO THE SEVERITY OF THEIR PAIN ON THE MENSTRUATION STARTING DATE. THE YOGA APPLICATIONS WERE USED FOR THREE MENSTRUAL CYCLES. THE MEAN AGE OF THE STUDENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS 20.30 +/- 0.46, WHILE THE MEAN AGE OF THE STUDENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP WAS 20.46 +/- 0.50. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PAIN LEVELS OF THE STUDENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP IN THE FIRST, SECOND, THIRD AND FOURTH MEASUREMENTS WAS FOUND TO BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.001). IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PAIN LEVELS OF THE STUDENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP IN THE FIRST, SECOND, THIRD AND FOURTH MEASUREMENTS WAS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P > 0.05). YOGA CAN BE USED AS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION IN REDUCING MENSTRUAL PAIN IN WOMEN WITH PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
11  716  33 EFFECT OF INTEGRATED YOGA PRACTICES ON IMMUNE RESPONSES IN EXAMINATION STRESS - A PRELIMINARY STUDY. BACKGROUND: STRESS IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED OCCURRENCE OF AUTONOMIC, CARDIOVASCULAR, AND IMMUNE SYSTEM PATHOLOGY. THIS STUDY WAS DONE TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF STRESS ON PSYCHOLOGICAL, PHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS, AND IMMUNE SYSTEM DURING MEDICAL TERM -ACADEMIC EXAMINATION AND THE EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICES ON THE SAME. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT ON SIXTY FIRST-YEAR MBBS STUDENTS RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO YOGA GROUP AND CONTROL GROUP (30 EACH). THE YOGA GROUP UNDERWENT INTEGRATED YOGA PRACTICES FOR 35 MINUTES DAILY IN THE PRESENCE OF TRAINED YOGA TEACHER FOR 12 WEEKS. CONTROL GROUP DID NOT UNDERGO ANY KIND OF YOGA PRACTICE OR STRESS MANAGEMENT. PHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS LIKE HEART RATE, RESPIRATORY RATE, AND BLOOD PRESSURE WERE MEASURED. GLOBAL ASSESSMENT OF RECENT STRESS SCALE AND SPIELBERGERS STATE ANXIETY SCORE WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND DURING THE EXAMINATION. SERUM CORTISOL LEVELS, IL-4, AND IFN-GAMMA LEVELS WERE DETERMINED BY ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY TECHNIQUE. RESULT: IN THE YOGA GROUP, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED IN PHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS DURING THE EXAMINATION STRESS, WHEREAS IN THE CONTROL GROUP, A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE WAS OBSERVED. LIKEWISE, THE INDICATORS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS SHOWED HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN CONTROL GROUP COMPARED WITH SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN YOGA GROUP. DURING THE EXAMINATION, THE INCREASE IN SERUM CORTICAL AND DECREASE IN SERUM IFN-GAMMA IN YOGA GROUP WAS LESS SIGNIFICANT (P<0.01) THAN IN THE CONTROL GROUP (P<0.001). BOTH THE GROUPS DEMONSTRATED AN INCREASE IN SERUM IL-4 LEVELS, THE CHANGES BEING INSIGNIFICANT FOR THE DURATION OF THE STUDY. CONCLUSION: YOGA RESISTS THE AUTONOMIC CHANGES AND IMPAIRMENT OF CELLULAR IMMUNITY SEEN IN EXAMINATION STRESS.	2011	
                                
12 1056  34 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY OF WOMEN. UNLABELLED: YOGA HAS OFTEN BEEN PERCEIVED AS A METHOD OF STRESS MANAGEMENT TOOL THAT CAN ASSIST IN ALLEVIATING DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY DISORDERS. THIS STUDY SOUGHT TO EVALUATE THE INFLUENCE OF YOGA IN RELIEVING SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY IN WOMEN WHO WERE REFERRED TO A YOGA CLINIC. METHODS: THE STUDY INVOLVED A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF WOMEN WHO WERE REFERRED TO A YOGA CLINIC FROM JULY 2006 TO JULY 2007. ALL NEW CASES WERE EVALUATED ON ADMISSION USING A PERSONAL INFORMATION QUESTIONNAIRE WELL AS BECK AND SPIELBERGER TESTS. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED INTO AN EXPERIMENTAL AND A CONTROL GROUP. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (N=34) PARTICIPATED IN TWICE WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES OF 90 MIN DURATION FOR TWO MONTHS. THE CONTROL GROUP (N=31) WAS ASSIGNED TO A WAITING LIST AND DID NOT RECEIVE YOGA. BOTH GROUPS WERE EVALUATED AGAIN AFTER THE TWO-MONTH STUDY PERIOD. RESULTS: THE AVERAGE PREVALENCE OF DEPRESSION IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PRE AND POST YOGA INTERVENTION WAS 12.82+/-7.9 AND 10.79+/-6.04 RESPECTIVELY, A STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT DECREASE (P=0.13). HOWEVER, WHEN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP, WOMEN WHO PARTICIPATED IN YOGA CLASSES SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN STATE ANXIETY (P=0.03) AND TRAIT ANXIETY (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: PARTICIPATION IN A TWO-MONTH YOGA CLASS CAN LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PERCEIVED LEVELS OF ANXIETY IN WOMEN WHO SUFFER FROM ANXIETY DISORDERS. THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT YOGA CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY OR AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD FOR MEDICAL THERAPY IN THE TREATMENT OF ANXIETY DISORDERS.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
13 2319  36 TREATING THE CLIMACTERIC SYMPTOMS IN INDIAN WOMEN WITH AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO YOGA THERAPY: A RANDOMIZED CONTROL STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE CLIMACTERIC SYMPTOMS, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND PERSONALITY IN PERIMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. DESIGN: ONE HUNDRED TWENTY PARTICIPANTS (AGES 40-55 Y) WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO STUDY ARMS, IE, YOGA AND CONTROL. THE YOGA GROUP PRACTICED AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO YOGA THERAPY COMPRISING SURYA NAMASKARA (SUN SALUTATION) WITH 12 POSTURES, PRANAYAMA (BREATHING PRACTICES), AND AVARTAN DHYAN (CYCLIC MEDITATION), WHEREAS THE CONTROL GROUP PRACTICED A SET OF SIMPLE PHYSICAL EXERCISES UNDER SUPERVISION OF TRAINED TEACHERS FOR 8 WEEKS (1 H DAILY, 5 DAYS PER WEEK). THE ASSESSMENTS WERE MADE BY GREENE CLIMACTERIC SCALE, PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE, AND EYSENCK'S PERSONALITY INVENTORY BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION. RESULTS: OF THE THREE FACTORS OF THE GREENE CLIMACTERIC SCALE, THE MANN-WHITNEY TEST SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS (P < 0.05) IN THE VASOMOTOR SYMPTOMS, A MARGINALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE (P = 0.06) IN PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS BUT NOT IN THE SOMATIC COMPONENT. EFFECT SIZES WERE HIGHER IN THE YOGA GROUP FOR ALL FACTORS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER DEGREE OF DECREASE IN PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE SCORES (P < 0.001, INDEPENDENT SAMPLES T TEST) IN THE YOGA GROUP COMPARED WITH CONTROLS (BETWEEN-GROUP ANALYSIS) WITH A HIGHER EFFECT SIZE IN THE YOGA GROUP (1.10) THAN THE CONTROL (0.27). ON THE EYSENCK'S PERSONALITY INVENTORY, THE DECREASE IN NEUROTICISM WAS GREATER (P < 0.05) IN THE YOGA GROUP (EFFECT SIZE = 0.43) THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (EFFECT SIZE = 0.21) WITH NO CHANGE IN EXTROVERSION IN EITHER THE YOGA OR CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: EIGHT WEEKS OF AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO YOGA THERAPY DECREASES CLIMACTERIC SYMPTOMS, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND NEUROTICISM IN PERIMENOPAUSAL WOMEN BETTER THAN PHYSICAL EXERCISE.	2008	

14  505  30 COMPARATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA AND PHYSICAL EXERCISE ON BIOCHEMICAL FUNCTIONS IN PERIMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. INTRODUCTION: MENOPAUSE IS A TRANSITIONAL PHASE IN WHICH SOME WOMEN EXPERIENCE DISCOMFORT, WHILE OTHERS MAY EXHIBIT VARIETY OF SYMPTOMS. THE POWER OF YOGA THERAPY IN RELIEVING STRESS, ENHANCING HEALTH, IMPROVING FITNESS AND MANAGING SYMPTOMS OF A VARIETY OF DISORDERS IS REMARKABLE. AIM: THE CURRENT STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF HATHA YOGA THERAPY AND REGULAR PHYSICAL EXERCISE ON THE FASTING BLOOD SUGAR (FBS), GLYCATED HAEMOGLOBIN (GHB), THYROID STIMULATING HORMONE (TSH), SERUM CORTISOL AND TOTAL PLASMA THIOL LEVELS IN PERIMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE STUDY INCLUDED 216 WOMEN WITH PERIMENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS, 111 IN TEST GROUP (HATHA YOGA) AND 105 IN CONTROL GROUP (PHYSICAL EXERCISE). THE DURATION OF INTERVENTION WAS 45 MINUTES EVERY DAY FOR 12 WEEKS. BLOOD SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED IN THE PRE AND POST INTERVENTION PERIOD. STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE WAS DEFINED AS P<0.05. RESULTS: FBS AND GHB (P</=0.05) SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE AFTER YOGA THERAPY. CORTISOL LEVELS SIGNIFICANTLY (P</=0.05) INCREASED IN THE POST INTERVENTION PERIOD IN THE CONTROL GROUP. HOWEVER, IT IS MAINTAINED IN THE TEST GROUP BETWEEN THE TWO TIME PERIODS. THE TOTAL PLASMA THIOLS LEVEL SHOWED A RISE IN THE POST INTERVENTION PERIOD, SIGNIFICANT RISE (P</=0.001) IN CONTROL GROUP BUT NOT SIGNIFICANT IN THE TEST GROUP. THE TSH LEVELS WERE NOT ALTERED IN ANY GROUP. CONCLUSION: IT IS CONCLUDED THAT EXERCISE HELPS IN MAINTAINING THE SUGAR LEVELS BUT CALMING EFFECTS OF YOGA PRACTICE IS IMPORTANT IN RELIEVING STRESS AND ENHANCING HEALTH IN PERIMENOPAUSAL WOMEN.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
15  748  24 EFFECT OF SAHAJA YOGA MEDITATION ON QUALITY OF LIFE, ANXIETY, AND BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL. OBJECTIVE: THE PRESENT STUDY INVESTIGATES THE EFFECT OF SAHAJA YOGA MEDITATION ON QUALITY OF LIFE, ANXIETY, AND BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL. DESIGN: THE PROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL COHORT STUDY ENROLLED TWO STUDY GROUPS: THOSE RECEIVING TREATMENT FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SAHAJA YOGA RESEARCH AND HEALTH CENTER (MEDITATION GROUP) AND THOSE RECEIVING TREATMENT FROM THE MAHATMA GANDHI MISSION HOSPITAL (CONTROL GROUP). RESEARCHERS MEASURED QUALITY OF LIFE, ANXIETY, AND BLOOD PRESSURE BEFORE AND AFTER TREATMENT. RESULTS: SIXTY-SEVEN (67) PARTICIPANTS IN THE MEDITATION GROUP AND 62 PARTICIPANTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP COMPLETED THE STUDY. THE TWO GROUPS WERE COMPARABLE IN DEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS. AT BASELINE, THE MEDITATION GROUP HAD HIGHER QUALITY OF LIFE (P<0.001) THAN CONTROLS BUT SIMILAR ANXIETY LEVEL (P=0.74) TO CONTROLS. WITHIN-GROUP PRE- VERSUS POST-TREATMENT COMPARISONS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN QUALITY OF LIFE, ANXIETY, AND BLOOD PRESSURE IN THE MEDITATION GROUP (P<0.001), WHILE IN CONTROLS, QUALITY OF LIFE DETERIORATED AND THERE WAS NO IMPROVEMENT IN BLOOD PRESSURE. THE IMPROVEMENT IN QUALITY OF LIFE, ANXIETY REDUCTION, AND BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL WAS GREATER IN THE MEDITATION GROUP. THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF MEDITATION REMAINED SIGNIFICANT AFTER ADJUSTING FOR CONFOUNDERS. CONCLUSIONS: MEDITATION TREATMENT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN QUALITY OF LIFE, ANXIETY REDUCTION, AND BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
16 1616  29 MINDFUL AWARENESS FOR FEMALE DENTAL STUDENTS THROUGH YOGA, MOTIVATIONAL VIDEO, AND A COMBINATION OF TWO ON STRESS REDUCTION. OBJECTIVE: ASSESSMENT OF THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF YOGA, MOTIVATIONAL VIDEOS, AND A COMBINATION OF TWO ON STRESS REDUCTION IN FEMALE DENTAL STUDENTS. METHODS: THE CURRENT STUDY DESIGN IS A NONRANDOMIZED TRIAL CARRIED OUT AMONG FEMALE DENTAL STUDENTS (N = 120). THE SELECTED SUBJECTS WERE ALLOCATED INTO THREE GROUPS, NAMELY, GROUP A: YOGA GROUP ASSIGNED UNDER A PROFESSIONAL YOGA INSTRUCTOR, GROUP B: MOTIVATIONAL VIDEO GROUP, AND GROUP C: A COMBINATION OF TWO (A AND B) INVOLVING YOGA SESSIONS AND MOTIVATIONAL VIDEOS; FOLLOWING WHICH FORMATIVE EXAMINATIONS WERE CARRIED OUT AT 6 WEEKS WHICH WERE REFERRED TO AS STRESSOR 1 AND THOSE CARRIED OUT AT 12 WEEKS WERE REFERRED TO AS STRESSOR 2. USING SPIELBERGER'S STATE-TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY FOR ADULTS (STAI-A) RECORDINGS WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE, STRESSOR 1, AND STRESSOR 2. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN TRAIT ANXIETY SCORES AT BOTH STRESSORS IN ALL THE GROUPS WITH A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DEPRESSION SCORE FROM STRESSOR 1 TO 2 IN GROUP 1 AND GROUP 3 SUBJECTS. THE SIGNIFICANT DECREASE OCCURRED IN STAI-A SCORES IN GROUP 1 AND GROUP 3 SUBJECTS AT BOTH STRESSORS (P < 0.001) WITH NO CHANGE OBSERVED IN GROUP 2 SUBJECTS. CONCLUSION: THE PRESENT STUDY IS ONE OF A KIND AND POSITIVELY CORRELATES YOGA AND MOTIVATIONAL VIDEOS WITH STRESS REDUCTION. BOTH OF THESE INTERVENTIONS PROVED TO BE BENEFICIARY FOR PHYSICAL AS WELL AS MENTAL HEALTH OF STUDY SUBJECTS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
17  961  26 EFFECTS OF A YOGA NIDRA ON THE LIFE STRESS AND SELF-ESTEEM IN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA NIDRA ON LIFE STRESS AND SELF-ESTEEM IN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. METHODS: THIS STUDY IS A NON-EQUIVALENT CONTROL GROUP PRETEST-POSTTEST DESIGN. FORTY UNIVERSITY STUDENTS WERE SELECTED BY CONVENIENCE SAMPLING, WITH 20 ASSIGNED TO A YOGA NIDRA GROUP AND 20 TO A CONTROL GROUP. THE YOGA GROUP PARTICIPATED IN BI-WEEKLY, 1-H SESSIONS OF YOGA NIDRA FOR 8 WEEKS. LIFE STRESS INTENSITY LEVEL WAS MEASURED USING A 10CM VISUAL ANALOG SCALE. SELF-ESTEEM SCORE WAS MEASURED BY ROSENBERG'S SELF-ESTEEM SCALE. RESULTS: THE YOGA NIDRA GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED LIFE STRESS INTENSITY LEVELS COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. THE YOGA GROUP ALSO SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED SELF-ESTEEM SCORES COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT YOGA NIDRA COULD ALLEVIATE THE LIFE STRESS INTENSITY LEVEL AND INCREASE THE SELF-ESTEEM IN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
18  530  35 COMPARISON OF REGULAR AEROBIC AND YOGA ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. BACKGROUND: THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) IS CHARACTERIZED BY FATIGUE, MOTOR WEAKNESS, AND SPASTICITY, TO NAME A FEW. MS SYMPTOMS MAY LEAD TO PHYSICAL INACTIVITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF SECONDARY DISEASES. THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF REGULAR AEROBIC AND YOGA ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF PATIENTS WITH MS. METHODS: THE PRESENT QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON 90 PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC MS CHOSEN RANDOMLY AND DIVIDED INTO TWO TEST AND ONE CONTROL GROUPS. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING SPSS SOFTWARE (VERSION 11.5) THROUGH PAIRED T-TEST, ANOVA, AND TUKEY'S POST HOC. RESULTS: THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AMONG THE SCORES OF QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE THREE GROUPS PRIOR TO INVESTIGATION. ALTHOUGH THEY WERE SIGNIFICANT AFTER INTERVENTION. THE MEAN SCORE OF YOGA GROUP WAS HIGHER THAN THAT OF AEROBIC GROUP, AND AEROBIC GROUP SHOWED A HIGHER MEAN SCORE COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL. CONCLUSION: YOGA AND AEROBIC EXERCISES MAY IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH MS. IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT THE GOVERNOR ALONG WITH MS SOCIETIES AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS SERVICING AND SUPPORTING PATIENTS START TO DEVELOP SPORT-REGULATED PROGRAMS TO HELP IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR THESE PATIENTS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
19 1637  26 MODULATION OF CARDIAC AUTONOMIC BALANCE WITH ADJUVANT YOGA THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH REFRACTORY EPILEPSY. THE PRACTICE OF YOGA REGULATES BODY PHYSIOLOGY THROUGH CONTROL OF POSTURE, BREATHING, AND MEDITATION. EFFECTS OF YOGA ON AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS OF PATIENTS WITH REFRACTORY EPILEPSY, AS QUANTIFIED BY STANDARDIZED AUTONOMIC FUNCTION TESTS (AFTS), WERE DETERMINED. THE YOGA GROUP (N=18) RECEIVED SUPERVISED TRAINING IN YOGA, AND THE EXERCISE GROUP (N=16) PRACTICED SIMPLE ROUTINE EXERCISES. AFTS WERE REPEATED AFTER 10 WEEKS OF DAILY SESSIONS. DATA WERE COMPARED WITH THOSE OF HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS (N=142). THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PARASYMPATHETIC PARAMETERS AND A DECREASE IN SEIZURE FREQUENCY SCORES. THERE WAS NO IMPROVEMENT IN BLOOD PRESSURE PARAMETERS IN EITHER GROUP. TWO PATIENTS IN THE YOGA GROUP ACHIEVED NORMAL AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS AT THE END OF 10 WEEKS OF THERAPY, WHEREAS THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN THE EXERCISE GROUP. THE DATA SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY HAVE A ROLE AS AN ADJUVANT THERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION IN PATIENTS WITH REFRACTORY EPILEPSY.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
20 2103  25 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY LEVEL IN SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS. PURPOSE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY LEVEL IN SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN WITH PRETEST-POSTTEST CONTROL GROUP. THE POPULATION OF THE STUDY CONSISTED OF SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS WITH REGISTERED IN MALATYA AND ELAZIG COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH CENTERS AND REGULARLY GOING TO THESE CENTERS. THE SAMPLE GROUP OF THE STUDY CONSISTED OF TOTALLY 100 PATIENTS INCLUDING 50 PATIENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND 50 PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP WHO WERE SPECIFIED THROUGH POWER ANALYSIS AND CHOSEN BY USING RANDOM SAMPLING METHOD FROM THIS POPULATION. THE DATA WERE COLLECTED BETWEEN APRIL 2015 AND AUGUST 2015. 'PATIENT DESCRIPTION FORM' AND 'FROGS' WERE USED TO COLLECT THE DATA. YOGA WAS APPLIED TO PATIENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP. ANY INTERVENTION WAS NOT MADE TO PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP. PERCENTAGE DISTRIBUTION, ARITHMETIC MEAN, STANDARD DEVIATION, CHI-SQUARE, INDEPENDENT SAMPLES T TEST, AND PAIRED T TEST WERE USED TO ASSESS THE DATA. RESULTS: PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL AND EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PRETEST SUBSCALE AND THE TOTAL MEANS SCORES OF FROGS WAS FOUND TO BE LOW.

1   37 150 A 2X2 RANDOMISED FACTORIAL SWAT OF THE USE OF A PEN AND SMALL, FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO IMPROVE RECRUITMENT IN A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA FOR OLDER ADULTS WITH MULTIMORBIDITY. BACKGROUND: MONETARY AND OTHER INCENTIVES MAY INCREASE RECRUITMENT TO RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS. METHODS: 2X2 FACTORIAL 'STUDY WITHIN A TRIAL' OF INCLUDING A PEN AND/OR POUND5 (GBP) IN CASH WITH A POSTAL RECRUITMENT PACK TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS RANDOMISED INTO THE HOST TRIAL ('GENTLE YEARS YOGA') FOR OLDER ADULTS WITH MULTIMORBIDITY. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: RETURN, AND TIME TO RETURN, OF SCREENING FORM, AND THE COST PER ADDITIONAL PARTICIPANT RANDOMISED. BINARY DATA WERE ANALYSED USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION AND TIME TO RETURN USING COX PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS REGRESSION. RESULTS: 818 POTENTIAL HOST TRIAL PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED. BETWEEN THOSE SENT A PEN (N=409) AND NOT SENT A PEN (N=409), THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A DIFFERENCE IN THE PROPORTION OF PARTICIPANTS RANDOMISED (15 (3.7%) VERSUS 11 (2.7%); OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.63-3.04), IN RETURNING A SCREENING FORM (66 (16.1%) VERSUS 61 (14.9%); OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.75-1.61) NOR IN TIME TO RETURN THE SCREENING FORM (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.77-1.55). BETWEEN THOSE SENT POUND5 (N=409) AND NOT SENT POUND5 (N=409), THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF INCREASED RANDOMISATION (14 (3.4%) VERSUS 12 (2.9%); OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.54-2.57), BUT MORE SCREENING FORMS WERE RETURNED (77 (18.8%) VERSUS 50 (12.2%); OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.13-2.45) AND THERE WAS DECREASED TIME TO RETURN SCREENING FORM (HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.09-2.22). NO SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION BETWEEN THE INTERVENTIONS WAS OBSERVED. THE COST PER ADDITIONAL PARTICIPANT RANDOMISED WAS POUND32 AND POUND1000 FOR THE PEN AND POUND5, RESPECTIVELY. CONCLUSION: A SMALL, MONETARY INCENTIVE DID NOT RESULT IN MORE PARTICIPANTS BEING RANDOMISED INTO THE HOST TRIAL BUT DID ENCOURAGE INCREASED AND FASTER RESPONSE TO THE RECRUITMENT INVITATION. SINCE IT IS RELATIVELY COSTLY, WE DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS INTERVENTION FOR USE TO INCREASE RECRUITMENT IN THIS POPULATION. PENS WERE CHEAPER BUT DID NOT PROVIDE EVIDENCE OF BENEFIT.	2021	

2 2748  34 YOGA PRACTICE IN ENGLAND 1997-2008: PREVALENCE, TEMPORAL TRENDS, AND CORRELATES OF PARTICIPATION. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS A HOLISTIC PRACTICE THAT MAY OFFER SEVERAL HEALTH BENEFITS. NO STUDY HAS EXAMINED THE PREVALENCE, TEMPORAL TRENDS, OR CORRELATES OF YOGA PRACTICE AT THE POPULATION LEVEL IN A EUROPEAN COUNTRY AND VERY FEW SUCH STUDIES EXIST WORLDWIDE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE PREVALENCE, TRENDS AND CORRELATES OF YOGA PRACTICE IN ENGLAND BETWEEN 1997 AND 2008. FINDINGS: ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED IN EARLY 2013 USING HEALTH SURVEY FOR ENGLAND DATA. INDEPENDENT COHORTS, REPRESENTATIVE OF ADULTS LIVING IN ENGLAND, WERE SURVEYED IN ANNUAL CYCLES IN 1997-1999, 2003-2004, AND 2006/2008. PREVALENCE OF YOGA PRACTICE (DEFINED AS ANY PRACTICE IN THE PAST FOUR WEEKS) WAS DETERMINED AT EACH TIME POINT AND MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION WAS USED TO EXAMINE TEMPORAL TRENDS (USING 1997-1999 AS REFERENCE TIME POINT) AND THE CORRELATES OF YOGA PRACTICE. THE PREVALENCE OF YOGA PRACTICE WAS 0.46% (95% CI: 0.39%-0.52%) IN 1997-1999, 0.94% (0.83%-1.06%) IN 2003-2004, AND 1.11% (0.95%-1.28%) IN 2006/2008. YOGA PARTICIPANTS IN ENGLAND WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE OLDER, FEMALE, DEGREE EDUCATED, OF NON-MANUAL SOCIAL CLASS, LOWER BMI, BETTER SELF-RATED GENERAL HEALTH, INACTIVE OCCUPATION, AND HIGHER MODERATE-TO-VIGOROUS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. ADJUSTED FOR AGE, SEX, SOCIAL CLASS, AND LONG STANDING ILLNESSES, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASING TREND OF YOGA PRACTICE FROM 1997 TO 2008 (2003/04 OR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.59-2.34; 2006/08 OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.77-2.71). CONCLUSIONS: YOGA PRACTICE HAS INCREASED IN POPULARITY, THOUGH THE ABSOLUTE RATES ARE STILL RELATIVELY LOW. FUTURE POPULATION STUDIES SHOULD MORE COMPREHENSIVELY EXAMINE THE CONTEXTS, SETTINGS, STYLES, CORRELATES AND HEALTH BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
3 2263  29 THE PREVALENCE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF YOUNG AND MID-AGE WOMEN WHO USE YOGA AND MEDITATION: RESULTS OF A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SURVEY OF 19,209 AUSTRALIAN WOMEN. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE THE CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA AND MEDITATION USERS AND NON-USERS AMONGST YOUNG AND MID-AGED AUSTRALIAN WOMEN. DESIGN AND SETTING: THE RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED AS PART OF THE AUSTRALIAN LONGITUDINAL STUDY ON WOMEN'S HEALTH (ALSWH) WHICH WAS DESIGNED TO INVESTIGATE MULTIPLE FACTORS AFFECTING THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF WOMEN OVER A 20-YEAR PERIOD. PARTICIPANTS: THE YOUNGER (28-33 YEARS) (N=8885) AND MID-AGED (56-61 YEARS) (N=10,324) COHORTS OF THE ALSWH WHO COMPLETED SURVEY 5 IN 2006 AND 2007 RESPECTIVELY. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: USE OF YOGA. RESULTS: THIS STUDY ESTIMATES THAT 35% OF AUSTRALIAN WOMEN AGED 28-33 AND 27% OF AUSTRALIAN WOMEN AGED 56-61 USE YOGA OR MEDITATION. YOUNGER WOMEN WITH BACK PAIN (OR=1.28; 95% CI: 1.08, 1.52) AND ALLERGIES (OR=1.25; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.49) WERE MORE LIKELY TO USE YOGA OR MEDITATION, WHILE YOUNGER WOMEN WITH MIGRAINES OR HEADACHES (OR=0.73; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.87) WERE LESS LIKELY TO USE YOGA OR MEDITATION. MID-AGE WOMEN WITH LOW IRON (OR=1.68; 95% CI: 1.29, 2.19) AND BOWEL PROBLEMS (OR=1.37; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.65) WERE MORE LIKELY TO USE YOGA OR MEDITATION, WHILE MID AGE WOMEN WITH HYPERTENSION (OR=0.62; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.76) WERE LESS LIKELY TO USE YOGA OR MEDITATION. CONCLUSION: A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE FEMALE POPULATION ARE USING YOGA OR MEDITATION. GIVEN THAT WOMEN WHO REGULARLY USE YOGA OR MEDITATION POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH MEASURES OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH, THERE IS A NEED FOR FURTHER RESEARCH TO EXAMINE THE EXPERIENCES AND POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF THESE MIND-BODY PRACTICES FOR WOMEN'S HEALTH.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
4 2655  32 YOGA IMPROVES QUALITY OF LIFE AND FALL RISK-FACTORS IN A SAMPLE OF PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN AND TYPE 2 DIABETES. OBJECTIVE: ASSESS PRE TO-POST OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN AND TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM) RANDOMIZED TO AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION OR USUAL CARE. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED IF THEY SELF-REPORTED: CHRONIC PAIN; T2DM; >18 YEARS OLD; NO EXERCISE RESTRICTIONS OR CONSISTENT YOGA; AND CONSENTED TO THE STUDY. RESULTS: AFTER YOGA, THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN: BRIEF PAIN INVENTORY PAIN INTERFERENCE (49+/-15.00 VS. 41.25+/-19.46, P=.034); FULLERTON ADVANCED BALANCE SCALE (14.2+/-14.1 VS. 20.4+/-13.5, P=.03); UPPER EXTREMITY STRENGTH (7.7+/-6.3 VS.10.8+/-6.5, P=.02); LOWER EXTREMITY STRENGTH (4.1+/-3.8 VS. 6.7+/-4.8, P=.02); AND RAND 36-ITEM HEALTH SURVEY QUALITY OF LIFE SCORES (81.1+/-7.7 VS. 91.9+/-8.9, P=.04). BALANCE SCORES BECAME SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE DURING THE 8 WEEKS FOR PEOPLE RANDOMIZED TO THE CONTROL (27.1+/-9.9 VS. 21.7+/-13.4,=P.01). CONCLUSION: DATA FROM THIS SMALL RCT INDICATES YOGA MAY BE THERAPEUTIC AND MAY IMPROVE MULTIPLE OUTCOMES IN THIS SEEMINGLY AT-RISK POPULATION.

5  918  26 EFFECTIVENESS OF TRAINING PROGRAM COMBINING CHAKRAYOGA AND MEDITATION. BACKGROUND THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PROGRAM COMBINING CHAKRAYOGA AND MEDITATION ON THE PHYSICAL HEALTH AND DISEASE-RELATED FACTORS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS OF PEOPLE. METHODS NINETY-SEVEN SUBJECTS (32-83 YEARS OLD) WHO HAD FREE FROM PRIOR EXPERIENCES IN MEDITATION PROGRAMS OR CHAKRAYOGA TRAINING COURSES WERE ASSIGNED TO EITHER THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (EXP) (45 SUBJECTS; 13 MALE SUBJECTS AND 32 FEMALE SUBJECTS; AVERAGE AGE OF 60.67 YEARS, SD=11.09 YEARS) OR THE CONTROL GROUP (CONT) OF REMAINING SUBJECTS (52 SUBJECTS; 14 MALE SUBJECTS AND 38 FEMALE SUBJECTS; AVERAGE AGE OF 61.58 YEARS, SD=9.70 YEARS). SUBJECTS IN THE EXP PARTICIPATED IN THE CHAKRAYOGA MEDITATION PROGRAM FOR TWICE A WEEK FOR 2 H DURING 6 WEEKS IN EACH SESSION CONSISTED OF 1 H OF CHAKRAYOGA AND 1 H OF MEDITATION. THE MEASUREMENTS IN THIS STUDY INCLUDED THE MINDFULNESS, STRESS RESPONSE, SUBJECTIVE QUALITY OF LIFE, MEDICAL SYMPTOM CHECKLIST, DIFFICULTY IN EMOTIONAL REGULATION AND OBJECTIVE OF LIFE AND SENSE OF CONTROL. RESULTS RESULTS REVEALED THAT PARTICIPANTS IN THE EXP REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE RELIEF OF MINDFULNESS, STRESS RESPONSE, SUBJECTIVE QUALITY OF LIFE AND MEDICAL SYMPTOM CHECKLIST THAN THOSE IN THE CONT. CONCLUSIONS THESE FINDINGS PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT THE CHAKRAYOGA MEDITATION PROGRAM CAN HELP RELIEVE THE PHYSICAL HEALTH AND DISEASE-RELATED FACTORS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
6 1019  32 EFFECTS OF WEEKLY ONE-HOUR HATHA YOGA THERAPY ON RESILIENCE AND STRESS LEVELS IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA-SPECTRUM DISORDERS: AN EIGHT-WEEK RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA THERAPY ON RESILIENCE, BRAIN-DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR (BDNF) LEVELS, AND SALIVARY ALPHA AMYLASE (SAA) ACTIVITY IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA-SPECTRUM DISORDERS. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: SINGLE-BLINDED, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY IN WHICH OUTPATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA OR RELATED PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS (ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES, 10TH REVISION) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A YOGA OR A CONTROL GROUP. SETTING: NOVEMBER 2012-APRIL 2013 AT YAMANASHI PREFECTURAL KITA HOSPITAL, JAPAN. INTERVENTIONS: IN THE YOGA GROUP, PATIENTS RECEIVED WEEKLY 1-HOUR HATHA YOGA SESSIONS, IN ADDITION TO REGULAR TREATMENT, FOR 8 WEEKS. THOSE IN THE CONTROL GROUP UNDERWENT REGULAR TREATMENT, WHICH INCLUDED A DAYCARE REHABILITATION PROGRAM. OUTCOME MEASURES: ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED THE 25-ITEM RESILIENCE SCALE (RS), POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SYNDROME SCALE (PANSS), PLASMA AND SALIVARY BDNF LEVEL, AND SAA ACTIVITY. RESULTS: FIFTY PATIENTS PARTICIPATED (25 IN EACH GROUP; MEAN AGE+/-STANDARD DEVIATION, 50.9+/-11.3 YEARS; MEAN DURATION OF ILLNESS, 25.0+/-10.3 YEARS; MEAN TOTAL PANSS SCORE, 78.2+/-17.3). NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN CHANGES IN ANY VARIABLE FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 8 WERE FOUND BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS (CHANGES IN THE YOGA GROUP VERSUS THE CONTROL GROUP: RS SCORE, -1.6+/-19.9 VERSUS 0.3+/-17.2; PANSS SCORE, 0.5+/-12.0 VERSUS 5.0+/-15.6; PLASMA BDNF, 41.6+/-377.0 PG/DL VERSUS 73.4+/-346.0 PG/DL; SAA, -26.2+/-72.6 KU/L VERSUS -13.8+/-68.0 KU/L, RESPECTIVELY). CONCLUSIONS: ADJUNCT YOGA THERAPY SHOWED NO POSITIVE CHANGES IN RESILIENCE LEVEL OR STRESS MARKERS. DURATION AND INTENSITY OF YOGA SESSIONS AND THE FOCUS ON PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC ILLNESS MAY EXPLAIN THE NEGATIVE OBSERVATIONS IN LIGHT OF PAST POSITIVE EVIDENCE REGARDING YOGA THERAPY.	2014	
                                                                                                            
7  468  24 CHARACTERISTICS OF WOMEN WHO PRACTICE YOGA IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS DURING PREGNANCY. OBJECTIVES: YOGA PRACTICE DURING PREGNANCY IS GAINING INCREASING POPULARITY. THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE CHARACTERISTICS OF PREGNANT WOMEN WHO PRACTICED YOGA IN REGARD TO THE DIFFERENT LOCATIONS (AT HOME, IN YOGA CLASSES, OR BOTH). DESIGN: THE STUDY SAMPLE WAS DRAWN FROM THE AUSTRALIAN LONGITUDINAL STUDY ON WOMEN'S HEALTH (ALSWH), A NATIONAL LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF WOMEN TO INVESTIGATE MULTIPLE FACTORS AFFECTING HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF WOMEN OVER A 20-YEAR PERIOD. SETTING: POSTAL SURVEY. PARTICIPANTS: WOMEN BORN BETWEEN 1973 AND 1978, WHO WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED FROM THE NATIONAL MEDICARE DATABASE AND IDENTIFIED AS BEING PREGNANT OR HAVING RECENTLY GIVEN BIRTH (N=2316). OUTCOME MEASURES: RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN YOGA USE (ATTENDING YOGA CLASSES AND/OR PRACTISING YOGA AT HOME) AND WOMEN'S CHARACTERISTICS (DEMOGRAPHIC MEASURES, PREGNANCY-RELATED HEALTH CONCERNS, HEALTH SERVICE UTILISATION, ATTITUDES TO COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE). RESULTS: PRACTISING YOGA BOTH AT HOME AND IN CLASSES WAS ASSOCIATED WITH PERCEIVING COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE (CAM) AS PREVENTATIVE (ODDS RATIO (OR)=1.62); PERCEIVING CAM AS AFFORDING HEALTH CONTROL (OR=1.50); EXPERIENCING SADNESS (OR=1.72); PREPARING FOR LABOUR (OR=2.31); BIRTHING IN A BIRTH CENTRE (OR=7.97); AND EXPERIENCING LESS VOMITING (OR=0.38). PRACTISING AT HOME ONLY WAS ASSOCIATED WITH PERCEIVING CAM AS AFFORDING HEALTH CONTROL (OR=1.76); PERCEIVING CAM AS PROMOTING A HOLISTIC HEALTH APPROACH (OR=1.65); AND BIRTHING IN A BIRTH CENTRE (OR=3.54). PRACTISING IN CLASSES ONLY WAS ASSOCIATED WITH EXPERIENCING STRESS (OR=1.97); AND BIRTHING IN A BIRTH CENTRE (OR=4.85) (ALL P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE LOCATION IN WHICH A WOMAN PRACTICES YOGA IS ASSOCIATED WITH ATTITUDINAL, HEALTH-RELATED AND BIRTH ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                
8 1432  28 IMPROVING PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH IN FRONTLINE MENTAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS: YOGA-BASED STRESS MANAGEMENT VERSUS COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL STRESS MANAGEMENT. THE NEED FOR BRIEF, LOW-COST, EASILY DISSEMINABLE AND EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS TO PROMOTE HEALTHY LIFESTYLES IS HIGH. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. WE DEVELOPED TWO STUDIES TO COMPARE THE IMPACTS OF COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL STRESS MANAGEMENT (CBSM) AND YOGA BASED STRESS MANAGEMENT (YBSM) INTERVENTIONS FOR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS. STUDY 1 OFFERED AN 8-WEEK YBSM INTERVENTION TO 37 MENTAL HEALTHCARE PARTICIPANTS AND COLLECTED HEALTH DATA PRE AND POST. STUDY 2 OFFERED YBSM AND CBSM CLASSES TO 40 RANDOMLY ASSIGNED MENTAL HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND COLLECTED MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH DATA AT FOUR TIME POINTS. IN STUDY 1, USING T-TESTS, THE YBSM INTERVENTION AFFECTED A NUMBER OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL WELLBEING INDICES PRE TO POST. IN STUDY 2, USING LINEAR MIXED MODELING, BOTH YBSM AND CBSM GROUPS IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY (P <.05) IN FRUIT AND VEGETABLE INTAKE, HEART RATE, ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION, RELAXATION AND AWARENESS, PROFESSIONAL QUALITY OF LIFE, COMPASSION SATISFACTION, BURNOUT, DEPRESSION, AND STRESS LEVELS. THERE WAS A GROUP BY TIME EFFECT FOR COPING CONFIDENCE (CBSM INCREASED MORE, P<.05, F = 4.34), PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (YBSM INCREASED MORE, P<.05, F = 3.47), OVERALL MENTAL HEALTH (YBSM INCREASED MORE, P<.10, F =5.32), AND SECONDARY TRAUMATIC STRESS (YBSM DECREASED MORE, P<.10, F = 4.89). YBSM AND CBSM APPEAR TO BE USEFUL FOR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS' MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH. YBSM DEMONSTRATES SOME BENEFIT ABOVE AND BEYOND THE EXTREMELY WELL-STUDIED AND EMPIRICALLY SUPPORTED CBSM, INCLUDING INCREASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, OVERALL MENTAL HEALTH, AND DECREASED SECONDARY TRAUMATIC STRESS BENEFITS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
9 2164  28 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND SELF-ESTEEM ON MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS-A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS FOUND THAT YOGA CAN ENHANCE QUALITY OF LIFE AND EASE MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. THE STUDY EXAMINED WHETHER SELF-ESTEEM MEDIATED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE, FATIGUE AND MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS, UTILIZING VALIDATED OUTCOME MEASURES. STUDY DESIGN: THIS IS A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA WITH THOSE OF USUAL CARE IN 40 BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WHO SUFFERED FROM MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS. ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED ALL 3 ASSESSMENTS (WEEK 0, WEEK 12, AND WEEK 24) AND PROVIDED FULL DATA. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: OUTCOMES WERE MEASURED USING SELF-RATING INSTRUMENTS. MEDIATION ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED USING SPSS. RESULTS: SELF-ESTEEM MEDIATED THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON TOTAL MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS (B=-2.11, 95% BCI [-5.40 TO -0.37]), PSYCHOLOGICAL MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS (B=-0.94, 95% BCI [-2.30 TO -0.01]), AND UROGENITAL MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS (B=-0.66, 95% BCI [-1.65 TO -0.15]), QUALITY OF LIFE (B=8.04, 95% BCI [3.15-17.03]), SOCIAL WELL-BEING (B=1.80, 95% BCI [0.54-4.21]), EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING (B=1.62, 95% BCI [0.70-3.34]), FUNCTIONAL WELL-BEING (B=1.84, 95% BCI [0.59-4.13]), AND FATIGUE (B=4.34, 95% BCI [1.28-9.55]). SELF-ESTEEM HAD NO EFFECT ON SOMATOVEGETATIVE MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS (B=-0.50, 95% BCI N.S.) OR ON PHYSICAL WELL-BEING (B=0.79, 95% BCI N.S.). CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS SUPPORT THE ASSUMPTION THAT SELF-ESTEEM PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF YOGA AND THAT YOGA CAN HAVE LONG-TERM BENEFITS FOR WOMEN DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER AND UNDERGOING MENOPAUSAL TRANSITION.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
10  956  27 EFFECTS OF A PRENATAL YOGA PROGRAMME ON THE DISCOMFORTS OF PREGNANCY AND MATERNAL CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY IN TAIWAN. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE A YOGA PROGRAMME PROVIDED TO PRIMIGRAVIDAS IN THE THIRD TRIMESTER OF PREGNANCY WITH THE AIM OF DECREASING THE DISCOMFORTS ASSOCIATED WITH PREGNANCY AND INCREASING CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY. DESIGN: NON-RANDOMISED CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTAL STUDY. SETTING: A HOSPITAL IN NORTHERN TAIWAN. PARTICIPANTS: THE TARGET POPULATION WAS PRIMIGRAVIDAS AT 26-28 WEEKS OF GESTATION (NO HIGH-RISK PREGNANCIES) WHO HAD NOT ENGAGED IN REGULAR EXERCISE OR YOGA FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR. THE STUDY INCLUDED 88 INDIVIDUALS; 43 IN THE CONTROL GROUP AND 45 IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WHO TOOK PART IN THE PRENATAL YOGA PROGRAMME. INTERVENTION: THE DURATION OF THE PRENATAL YOGA PROGRAMME WAS 12-14 WEEKS, WITH AT LEAST THREE SESSIONS PER WEEK. EACH WORKOUT LASTED FOR 30 MINUTES. MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: WOMEN WHO TOOK PART IN THE PRENATAL YOGA PROGRAMME REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER PREGNANCY DISCOMFORTS THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (38.28 VS 43.26, Z=-2.58, P=0.01) AT 38-40 WEEKS OF GESTATION. THE SUBJECTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE YOGA PROGRAMME EXHIBITED HIGHER OUTCOME AND SELF-EFFICACY EXPECTANCIES DURING THE ACTIVE STAGE OF LABOUR (104.13 VS 83.53, T=3.24, P=0.002; 99.26 VS 77.70, T=3.99, P </= 0.001) AND THE SECOND STAGE OF LABOUR (113.33 VS 88.42, T=3.33, P=0.002; 102.19 VS 79.40, T=3.71, P </= 0.001) COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. KEY CONCLUSIONS: THE PROVISION OF BOOKLETS AND VIDEOS ON YOGA DURING PREGNANCY MAY CONTRIBUTE TO A REDUCTION IN PREGNANCY DISCOMFORTS AND IMPROVED CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: THIS YOGA PROGRAMME PROVIDES HEALTH-CARE PROFESSIONALS WITH AN EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTION.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
11 2115  25 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH HAEMOPHILIA. THE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY HAEMOPHILIA LEAD TO IMPAIRMENTS OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH HAEMOPHILIA. THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH HAEMOPHILIA IN SHIRAZ, IRAN. THIS SEMI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WITH PRE- AND POST-TEST DESIGN WAS PERFORMED ON 27 BOYS BETWEEN 8 AND 16 YEARS OLD WHO SUFFERED FROM HAEMOPHILIA. THE PATIENTS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS. THE NUMBER OF BLEEDINGS, ABSENCES FROM SCHOOL, AND REFERRALS TO THE CLINIC WAS EVALUATED. THE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH INTERVIEWS AND USING THE PATIENTS' RECORDS IN THE HAEMOPHILIA CENTER. BESIDES, THE QUALITY OF LIFE WAS ASSESSED THROUGH THE HAEMO-QOL QUESTIONNAIRE. THEN, THE YOGA INTERVENTION WAS PERFORMED FOR 14 WEEKS AND THE DATA WERE COLLECTED IN THREE STAGES. THE COLLECTED DATA WERE ENTERED INTO THE SPSS STATISTICAL SOFTWARE, VERSION 18 AND WERE ANALYZED USING NON-PARAMETRIC FRIEDMAN TEST. AFTER THE INTERVENTION, SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED IN THE MEAN SCORES OF QUALITY OF LIFE DIMENSIONS AND THE NUMBER OF BLEEDINGS, SCHOOL ABSENCES, AND REFERRALS TO THE HAEMOPHILIA CLINIC (P<0.001). THUS, YOGA MAY IMPROVE THE HAEMOPHILIA CHILDREN'S AND ADOLESCENTS' PERCEPTION OF QUALITY OF LIFE WITHOUT THE RISK OF INJURY. THIS INTERVENTION ALSO SEEMED TO BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE NUMBER OF BLEEDINGS, REFERRALS TO THE HAEMOPHILIA CLINIC, AND ABSENCES FROM SCHOOL.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
12 1629  24 MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA FOR YOUTH WITH PERSISTENT CONCUSSION: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: WE EXPLORED THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA (MBY) FOR YOUTH WITH PERSISTENT CONCUSSION BY EXAMINING OCCUPATION-BASED AND NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL OUTCOMES. METHOD: IN THIS CASE SERIES DESIGN STUDY, 6 YOUTHS AGES 13-17 YR WITH CONCUSSION SYMPTOMS FOR >4 WK PARTICIPATED IN AN 8-WK MBY INTERVENTION, 1X/WK FOR 45 MIN. PARTICIPATION, SELF-EFFICACY, AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY (24 HR) WERE COLLECTED BEFORE, AFTER, AND 3 MO AFTER THE INTERVENTION. HEART RATE VARIABILITY WAS ALSO MEASURED DURING EACH SESSION. RESULTS: TRENDS OF INCREASED SELF-EFFICACY IN ACADEMIC, SOCIAL, AND EMOTIONAL DOMAINS WERE FOUND AFTER MBY AND MAINTAINED AT 3-MO FOLLOW-UP. TRENDS OF INCREASING HEART RATE VARIABILITY WERE ALSO FOUND PRE- TO POSTINTERVENTION AND WITHIN THE EIGHT MBY SESSIONS. CONCLUSION: PRELIMINARY RESULTS REVEAL POSITIVE TRENDS AFTER A NOVEL, SAFE INTERVENTION FOR YOUTH WITH PERSISTENT CONCUSSION SYMPTOMS AND THE VALUE OF EXPLORING BOTH OCCUPATION-BASED AND NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES. FUTURE RESEARCH WITH A LARGER SAMPLE AND CONTROL GROUP IS WARRANTED.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
13 1657  18 MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN AND INTEREST IN MEDITATION AND YOGA IN HOME HEALTH AIDES: EVIDENCE FROM THE HOME HEALTH OCCUPATIONS MUSCULOSKELETAL EXAMINATIONS (HHOME) STUDY. HOME HEALTHCARE AIDES (HHAS) ARE A GROWING U.S. WORKFORCE HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO WORKPLACE STRESSORS AND MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN. IN THE PRESENT STUDY WE: 1) EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATION OF MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN TO LIFE SATISFACTION AND EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION; AND 2) CHARACTERIZE INTEREST IN MEDITATION AND YOGA IN A SAMPLE OF HHAS. A NONPROBABILISTIC SAMPLE OF HHAS EMPLOYED AT HOME HEALTHCARE AGENCIES IN FLORIDA, MASSACHUSETTS, AND OREGON (N = 285 TOTAL) COMPLETED A SELF-ADMINISTERED QUESTIONNAIRE WITH STANDARD SURVEY MEASURES ON MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN LOCATION, DURATION, AND SEVERITY; LIFE SATISFACTION; EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION; AND INTEREST IN MEDITATION TECHNIQUES AND YOGA. AMONG HHAS RESPONDING, 48.4% REPORTED PAIN IN THE LAST 7 DAYS AND 46.6% REPORTED PAIN IN THE LAST 3 MONTHS. HOME HEALTHCARE AIDES WHO REPORTED CURRENT PAIN AND CHRONIC PAIN HAD A SIGNIFICANT (P < .05) DECREASE IN SATISFACTION WITH LIFE SCORE AND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION SCORE. THE MAJORITY OF HHAS REPORTED AN INTEREST IN LEARNING ABOUT THE BENEFITS (65.6%) AND PRACTICE (66.4%) OF MEDITATION AND A WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN A YOGA CLASS (59.2%) OR STRESS MANAGEMENT MEETING (59.1%). THE HHAS REPORTED BOTH ACUTE AND CHRONIC MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN THAT WAS CORRELATED WITH LOWER LIFE SATISFACTION AND GREATER EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION. MORE EFFORTS ARE NEEDED TO REDUCE THE SOURCES OF INJURY AND EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
14 1517  33 IS YOGA ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED SLEEP AMONGST BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS? BACKGROUND: BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS MAY EXPERIENCE SLEEP DISTURBANCES THAT CAN AFFECT THEIR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WELL-BEING. WE SOUGHT TO DETERMINE THE ASSOCIATION, IF ANY, BETWEEN YOGA AND SLEEP AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS IN A POPULATION-BASED COHORT. METHODS: THE NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY IS DESIGNED TO BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE US CIVILIAN NON-INSTITUTIONALIZED POPULATION. WE EVALUATED BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS IN THE 2017 COHORT TO DETERMINE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN YOGA AND SELF-REPORTED QUALITY OF SLEEP. RESULTS: OF THE 25,905 PEOPLE SURVEYED, REPRESENTING 238,738,039 IN THE POPULATION, 1.59% REPORTED A PREVIOUS HISTORY OF BREAST CANCER. BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WERE LESS LIKELY TO REPORT HAVING PRACTICED YOGA IN THE PRECEDING 12 MONTHS, COMPARED TO THOSE WITHOUT A HISTORY OF BREAST CANCER (9.98% VS 13.78%, P = .011). IN ADDITION, THEY WERE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT HAVING HAD TROUBLE FALLING ASLEEP (44.64% VS 36.32%, P = .002), STAYING ASLEEP (53.72% VS 39.43%, P < .001), AND USING SLEEP MEDICATION ON AT LEAST 1 DAY WITHIN THE PREVIOUS WEEK (23.80% VS 13.49%, P < .001) THAN THOSE WITHOUT BREAST CANCER. AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN DIFFICULTY FALLING ASLEEP (39.16% VS 44.98%, P = .482), DIFFICULTY STAYING ASLEEP (61.17% VS 52.70%, P = .305), AND NEEDING SLEEP MEDICATION (19.03% VS 24.53%, P = .395) BETWEEN THOSE WHO PRACTICED YOGA AND THOSE WHO DID NOT. CONTROLLING FOR SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS, THERE REMAINED NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN YOGA AND DIFFICULTY FALLING OR STAYING ASLEEP AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. CONCLUSION: THERE IS NO DIRECT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN YOGA AND SLEEP QUALITY IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
15 2161  25 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AMONG ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS META-ANALYSIS WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA FOR GLYCEMIC CONTROL AMONG ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES (T2DM). COMPREHENSIVE ELECTRONIC DATABASES SEARCHES LOCATED 2559 UNIQUE STUDIES WITH RELEVANT KEY TERMS. STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IF THEY (1) EVALUATED A YOGA INTERVENTION TO PROMOTE T2DM MANAGEMENT, (2) USED A COMPARISON GROUP, (3) REPORTED AN OBJECTIVE MEASURE OF GLYCEMIC CONTROL AT POST-INTERVENTION, AND (4) HAD FOLLOW-UP LENGTH OR POST-TEST OF AT LEAST 8WEEKS FROM BASELINE. INDEPENDENT RATERS CODED PARTICIPANT, DESIGN AND METHODOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND INTERVENTION CONTENT. SUMMARY EFFECT SIZES AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CI) WERE CALCULATED. TWENTY-THREE STUDIES WITH 2473 PARTICIPANTS (MEAN AGE=53YEARS; 43% WOMEN) MET ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA. COMPARED WITH CONTROLS, YOGA PARTICIPANTS WERE SUCCESSFUL IN IMPROVING THEIR HBA1C (D+=0.36, 95% CI=0.16, 0.56; K=16), FBG (D+=0.58, 95% CI=0.40, 0.76; K=20), AND PPBG (D+=0.40, 95% CI=0.23, 0.56; K=14). YOGA WAS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN LIPID PROFILE, BLOOD PRESSURE, BODY MASS INDEX, WAIST/HIP RATIO AND CORTISOL LEVELS. OVERALL, STUDIES SATISFIED AN AVERAGE OF 41% OF THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY (MQ) CRITERIA; MQ SCORE WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH ANY OUTCOME (PS >0.05). YOGA IMPROVED GLYCEMIC OUTCOMES AND OTHER RISK FACTORS FOR COMPLICATIONS IN ADULTS WITH T2DM RELATIVE TO A CONTROL CONDITION. ADDITIONAL STUDIES WITH LONGER FOLLOW-UPS ARE NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE LONG-TERM EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR ADULTS WITH T2DM.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
16 2327  24 TRENDS IN YOGA, TAI CHI, AND QIGONG USE AMONG US ADULTS, 2002-2017. OBJECTIVES: TO EXAMINE THE CHARACTERISTICS AND TEMPORAL TRENDS OF YOGA, TAI CHI, AND QIGONG (YTQ) USE AMONG US ADULTS. METHODS: USING THE 2002, 2007, 2012, AND 2017 NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEYS, WE EXAMINED THE PREVALENCE, PATTERNS, AND PREDICTING FACTORS OF YTQ USE BY TAYLOR SERIES LINEAR REGRESSION, THE WALD F CHI(2) TEST, AND MULTIVARIABLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELS (N = 116 404). RESULTS: YTQ USE INCREASED FROM 5.8% IN 2002 TO 14.5% IN 2017 (P </= .001). ONLY 6.6% OF YTQ USERS WERE REFERRED BY THEIR MEDICAL DOCTORS, AND APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD DISCLOSED THEIR USE OF YTQ TO MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. REASONS FOR USING YTQ INCLUDED (1) YTQ WAS BENEFICIAL, (2) YTQ FOCUSED ON THE WHOLE PERSON, AND (3) YTQ WAS NATURAL. ACUTE AND CHRONIC PAIN, ARTHRITIS, AND DEPRESSION WERE THE TOP 3 MEDICAL CONDITIONS FOR WHICH PEOPLE USED YTQ THE MOST. CONCLUSIONS: YTQ USE IS INCREASING SUBSTANTIALLY, MAINLY BECAUSE OF ITS NATURAL AND HOLISTIC HEALING APPROACH TOWARD HEALTH AND CHRONIC DISEASES. FUTURE STUDIES AIMING TO EXPLORE HOW TO BEST INTEGRATE YTQ INTO THE CURRENT HEALTH CARE SYSTEM ARE WARRANTED.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
17 2918  25 [THE EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA EXERCISES ON STRESS AND ANXIETY LEVELS IN MASTECTOMIZED WOMEN]. THIS ARTICLE SEEKS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA ON STRESS AND ANXIETY LEVELS IN MASTECTOMIZED WOMEN. IT ALSO INVESTIGATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE LEVELS WITH THE FOLLOWING VARIABLES: AGE; MARITAL STATUS; RELIGION; INSTRUCTION; PROFESSION; SMOKE ADDICTION; ELITISM; STAGING OF THE DISEASE; AND TREATMENT PHASE. THIS INVOLVED CONTROLLED RANDOM CLINICAL TRIAL SAMPLING OF 45 MASTECTOMIZED WOMEN TREATED AT THE ILZA BIANCO OUTPATIENT SERVICE OF SANTA RITA DE CASSIA HOSPITAL IN THE BRAZILIAN STATE OF ESPIRITO SANTO FROM MARCH TO NOVEMBER 2010. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PARTICIPATED IN 6 INDIVIDUALLY-APPLIED SESSIONS WITH INCENTIVE FOR ONGOING HOME PRACTICE AND WAS RE-EVALUATED AFTER THE PERIOD, WHEREAS THE CONTROL GROUP WAS RE-EVALUATED AFTER A PROPORTIONAL PERIOD. FOR THE STUDY OF THE VARIABLES, THE INTERVIEW AND RECORDING ON A FORM TECHNIQUE WAS USED, ALONG WITH THE ANXIETY TRAIT AND STATE TEST, AND THE STRESS SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS TEST. FOR STATISTICAL TREATMENT, THE STATISTICAL PACK FOR SOCIAL SCIENCES WAS USED. THE DATA ARE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AND HAVE SHOWN THAT HATHA YOGA EXERCISES DECREASE STRESS AND ANXIETY IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP. NO CONNECTION BETWEEN CONFOUNDING VARIABLES AND ANXIETY AND STRESS LEVELS WAS FOUND.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
18 1417  36 IMPORTANCE OF PATIENT EDUCATION FOR AT-HOME YOGA PRACTICE IN WOMEN WITH HORMONAL THERAPY-INDUCED PAIN DURING ADJUVANT BREAST CANCER TREATMENT: A FEASIBILITY STUDY. BACKGROUND: OSTEO-ARTICULAR PAIN (OAP) IS EXPERIENCED BY APPROXIMATELY 50% OF WOMEN UNDER HORMONAL THERAPY (HT) FOR BREAST CANCER (BC), WHICH INCREASES THE RISK FOR THERAPY DISCONTINUATION. THIS STUDY WAS AIMED TO ASSESS BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE COMBINED WITH PATIENT EDUCATION (PE) FOR AT-HOME PRACTICE BY EVALUATING FEASIBILITY AMONG BC PATIENTS UNDER HT AND MEASURING OAP, FLEXIBILITY AND SATISFACTION. METHODS: FEASIBILITY WAS EVALUATED BY PATIENT ADHERENCE AS ACCOMPLISHMENT OF AT LEAST 4 OUT OF 6 SUPERVISED YOGA-PE SESSIONS ALONG WITH 70% OR MORE AT-HOME YOGA SESSIONS. INTERVENTION (12 WEEKS) INCLUDED TWO 6-WEEKS PERIODS: P1 COMPRISING ONE 90-MINUTES SUPERVISED YOGA-PE SESSION/WEEK AND 15-MINUTES DAILY AT-HOME YOGA AND P2, DAILY AUTONOMOUS AT-HOME YOGA SESSIONS. EVALUATIONS (AT INCLUSION AND BY THE END OF EACH PERIOD) CONSISTED IN ASSESSMENT OF OAP ON VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS), FORWARD FLEXIBILITY (CM) AND PATIENT SATISFACTION ON LIKERT (0-10 POINTS) SCALE. RESULTS: BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 2018 AND MAY 2019 WE INCLUDED 24 PATIENTS OF MEDIAN 53 YEARS (RANGE 36-72). FEASIBILITY WAS VALIDATED BY 83% SUCCESSFUL ADHERENCE RATE. PAIN WAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED FROM MEDIAN VAS OF 6 [RANGE 4-10] TO 4 [RANGE 0-7] AT THE END OF BOTH P1 AND P2 (P < 0.01), ALBEIT WITH NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN P1 AND P2. FORWARD FLEXIBILITY IMPROVED BY A MEDIAN GAIN OF 8 CM (END OF P2) AND MEDIAN SATISFACTION SCORE OF 10/10 [RANGE 8-10]. CONCLUSION: COMBINED PHYSIOTHERAPY-YOGA-PE INTERVENTION IS A FEASIBLE STRATEGY TO INCREASE AT-HOME YOGA PRACTICE WITH POTENTIAL BENEFIT ON PAIN, FLEXIBILITY, AND SATISFACTION, THUS PROMPTING FURTHER EVALUATIONS IN LARGER RANDOMIZED MULTICENTER TRIALS.

19 1932  27 ROLE OF YOGA IN MODIFYING ANXIETY LEVEL IN WOMEN. ANXIETY LEADS TO DERANGEMENT IN PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. ANXIETY LEVELS ARE MORE IN FULL TIME HOUSEWIVES THAN WORKING WOMEN. THERE IS A NEED FOR SIMPLE, EASY TREATMENT FOR ANXIETY TO ALLEVIATE THE BURDEN ON HEALTH CAUSED BY ANXIETY. YOGA IS AMONG THE TOP TEN COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE THERAPIES. OUR STUDY AIMED TO DETERMINE THE ANXIETY LEVELS IN APPARENTLY HEALTHY FULL TIME HOUSEWIVES AND TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON ANXIETY LEVELS AMONG THEM. PRESENT STUDY IS A COMPARATIVE INTERVENTIONAL STUDY. STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON 50 APPARENTLY HEALTHY FULL TIME HOUSEWIVES (20-50 YEARS) WHO ATTENDED ONE MONTH YOGA CAMP. HAMILTON ANXIETY (HAMA) SCALE WAS USED TO EVALUATE ANXIETY LEVELS BEFORE AND AT THE END OF THE YOGA CAMP. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS DONE BY PAIRED T TEST USING SPSS 9.0. THE BASELINE PULSE RATE, SBP, DBP WERE 82.90 +/- 4.25 BPM, 124.84 +/- 11.022 MM HG, 85.20 +/- 10.81 MM HG RESPECTIVELY. AFTER FOUR WEEKS YOGA CAMP THERE WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT LOWERING OF PULSE RATE (77.58 +/- 3.86 BPM), SBP (117.92 +/- 6.76 MM HG), DBP (78.68 +/- 6.62 MM HG). BEFORE YOGA TRAINING, PERCENTAGE DISTRIBUTIONS OF SUBJECTS WITH MILD, MODERATE AND SEVERE ANXIETY WERE 6%, 18% AND 76% RESPECTIVELY. AT THE END OF FOUR WEEK YOGA TRAINING, PERCENTAGE DISTRIBUTIONS OF SUBJECTS WITH MILD, MODERATE AND SEVERE ANXIETY WERE 44.23%, 19.23% AND 36.53% RESPECTIVELY. THERE WAS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT (P = 0.000) DIFFERENCE IN THE MEAN VALUES OF TOTAL SCORE BEFORE (33.71 +/- 4.90) AND AFTER (26.93 +/- 4.53) YOGA. THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THERE WAS A REDUCTION IN THE SEVERITY OF ANXIETY FROM SEVERE TO MODERATE AND MILD INDICATING DECREASE IN ANXIETY FOLLOWING YOGA. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR STUDY, WE CONCLUDE THAT REGULAR YOGIC PRACTICES AND ADAPTING AND IMPLEMENTING THE PRINCIPALS AND PHILOSOPHY OF YOGA IN DAY TO DAY LIFE MAY DECREASE THE ANXIETY LEVEL.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                      
20 2771  15 YOGA REDUCES SYMPTOMS OF DISTRESS IN TSUNAMI SURVIVORS IN THE ANDAMAN ISLANDS. A MONTH AFTER THE DECEMBER 2004 TSUNAMI THE EFFECT OF A 1 WEEK YOGA PROGRAM WAS EVALUATED ON SELF RATED FEAR, ANXIETY, SADNESS AND DISTURBED SLEEP IN 47 SURVIVORS IN THE ANDAMAN ISLANDS. POLYGRAPH RECORDINGS OF THE HEART RATE, BREATH RATE AND SKIN RESISTANCE WERE ALSO MADE. AMONG THE 47 PEOPLE, 31 WERE SETTLERS FROM THE MAINLAND (I.E. INDIA, ML GROUP) AND 16 WERE ENDOGENOUS PEOPLE (EP GROUP). THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN SELF RATED FEAR, ANXIETY, SADNESS AND DISTURBED SLEEP IN BOTH GROUPS, AND IN THE HEART AND BREATH RATE IN THE ML GROUP, AND IN THE BREATH RATE ALONE IN THE EP GROUP, FOLLOWING YOGA (P < 0.05, T-TEST). THIS SUGGESTS THAT YOGA PRACTICE MAY BE USEFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF STRESS FOLLOWING A NATURAL DISASTER IN PEOPLE WITH WIDELY DIFFERING SOCIAL, CULTURAL AND SPIRITUAL BELIEFS.	2007

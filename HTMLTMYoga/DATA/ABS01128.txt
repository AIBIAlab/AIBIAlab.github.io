1 1128 175 EFFICACY OF VAMANA KARMA WITH IKSHVAKU KSHEERA YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF TAMAKA SHVASA (BRONCHIAL ASTHMA). INTRODUCTION: BRONCHIAL ASTHMA IS A HIGHLY PREVALENT DISEASE, AND IN MOST OF THE ETIOPATHOGENESIS AND SYMPTOMATOLOGY, IT CAN BE CORRELATED WITH TAMAKA SHVASA. IKSHVAKU (LAGENARIA VULGARIS [MANILA] STANDLEY.) IS AN ANNUAL HERBACEOUS CLIMBING PLANT WITH A LONG HISTORY OF MEDICINAL USES FOR THE TREATMENT OF VARIOUS AILMENTS INCLUDING JAUNDICE, DIABETES, ULCER, PILES, COLITIS, ASTHMA, INSANITY, HYPERTENSION, CONGESTIVE CARDIAC FAILURE AND SKIN DISORDERS. ITS FRUIT PULP IS USED BOTH AS AN EMETIC AND AS A PURGATIVE. AIMS: TO STUDY THE EFFICACY OF VAMANA KARMA WITH IKSHVAKU (LAGENARIA VULGARIS [MANILA] STANDLEY) KSHEERA YOGA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 15 PATIENTS FULFILLING THE DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR BRONCHIAL ASTHMA WERE SELECTED FROM OUTPATIENT AND INPATIENT DEPARTMENT OF PANCHAKARMA DEPARTMENT. THE SIGN AND SYMPTOMS, MAINLY BREATHLESSNESS, COUGH AND RHONCHI WERE GIVEN SCORES DEPENDING ON THEIR SEVERITY. THE PATIENTS WERE ALSO ASSESSED FOR LUNG FUNCTION TEST TO DETERMINE PULMONARY IMPAIRMENT. FOR VAMANA, THEY WERE GIVEN DEEPANA AND PACHANA WITH TRIKATU CHURNA FOR 3 DAYS AND THEN THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO SNEHAPANA WITH LUKEWARM COW'S GHEE. AFTER THE COMPLETION OF SNEHAPANA, THE PATIENT WERE GIVEN ABHYANGA, VASHPA SWEDANA AND DIET WITH PREDOMINANCE OF KAPHA (KAPHA BAHULA AHARA- DIET MIXED WITH MILK OR CURD), WHICH WAS THEN FOLLOWED BY VAMANA WITH IKSHVAKU KSHEERA YOGA AND SAMSARJANA KRAMA. FOLLOW-UP WAS DONE AT AN INTERVAL OF 15 DAYS FOR THREE TIMES AND T SCORES WERE NOTED BEFORE AND AFTER THE TREATMENT. THE SCORES WERE ANALYZED USING WILCOXON SIGNED-RANK TEST FOR SUBJECTIVE PARAMETERS AND STUDENT'S PAIRED T-TEST FOR OBJECTIVE PARAMETERS. RESULTS: THE TRIAL DRUG HAS SHOWN STATISTICALLY HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN BREATHLESSNESS, COUGH, RHONCHI, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN LUNG FUNCTION TESTS. CONCLUSION: THE TEST DRUG PROVED ITS EMETIC EFFECT ON THE PATIENTS OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA AND THUS RELIEVED THE SYMPTOMS OF THE DISEASE IMMEDIATELY. IT HAS REDUCED FREQUENCY OF EPISODES OF BREATHLESSNESS AND SEVERITY OF SYMPTOMS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
2  483  54 CLINICAL EFFICACY OF VAMANA KARMA WITH IKSHWAAKU BEEJA YOGA FOLLOWED BY SHATAPUSHPADI GHANAVATI IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ARTAVA KSHAYA W. S. R TO POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME. BACKGROUND: DUE TO SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE AND STRESS, THE INCIDENCE OF METABOLIC DISORDERS ARE INCREASING DAY BY DAY. AMONG THESE POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME (PCOS) IS AN INTRICATE DISORDER AFFECTING 4%-8% WOMEN IN THEIR REPRODUCTIVE AGE AND RELATED TO OVARIAN DYSFUNCTION CHARACTERIZED BY OBESITY, OLIGOMENORRHEA, ANOVULATION AND HYPERANDROGENISM. IN MODERN SYSTEM OF MEDICINE, THE AVAILABLE ALLOPATHIC REGIMEN HAS ITS OWN LIMITATIONS, SO IT IS NEED OF TIME TO FIND A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE THERAPY FOR SUCH TYPE OF CONDITION. THE MOST COMMON SYMPTOM IN 85%-90% OF PCOS PATIENTS IS OLIGOMENORRHEA WHICH CAN BE CORRELATED TO ARTAVA KSHAYA (LOSS OF MENSTRUAL FLUID) IN AYURVEDA. HENCE, IN THE PRESENT CLINICAL STUDY, VAMANA KARMA (THERAPEUTIC VOMITING) WITH IKSHWAAKU SEED FORMULATION FOLLOWED BY SHATAPUSHPADI GHANAVATI WAS PLANNED. AIMS: TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF VAMANA KARMA (THERAPEUTIC VOMITING) FOLLOWED BY SHATAPUSHPADI GHANAVATI IN THE MANAGEMENT OF AARTAVA KSHAYA (LOSS OF MENSTRUAL FLUID) W. S. R TO PCOS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 15 PATIENTS OF PCOS WERE CLINICALLY DIAGNOSED AND TREATED BY VAMANA KARMA (THERAPEUTIC VOMITING) PROCEDURE WITH IKSHWAAKU SEED FORMULATION. AFTER COMPLETION OF VAMANA KARMA (THERAPEUTIC VOMITING) AND SAMSARJANA KRAMA, (POST THERAPY DIETARY REGIMEN FOR REVIVAL) SHATAPUSHPADI GHANAVATI 2 VATI (EACH 500 MG) TWICE IN A DAY WITH LUKEWARM WATER WAS GIVEN FOR 45 DAYS. AFTER COMPLETION OF 2-MONTH TRIAL, ASSESSMENT OF THERAPY WAS ESTIMATED BY SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE PARAMETERS. RESULTS: STATISTICALLY EXTREMELY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.0001) RESULTS WERE FOUND IN MENSTRUAL IRREGULARITIES, OBESITY, AND BODY MASS INDEX. THE SIGNIFICANT RESULT IN REDUCTION OF NONDOMINANT FOLLICLES (P = 0.01 AND 0.03 FOR RIGHT AND LEFT OVARY, RESPECTIVELY), LOWERING THE FASTING BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL (P = 0.02) AND HIRSUTISM (P = 0.03) WAS FOUND. CONCLUSION: VAMANA KARMA (THERAPEUTIC VOMITING) FOLLOWED BY SHATAPUSHPADI GHANAVATI IS VERY EFFECTIVE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF OBESE PCOS PATIENTS AND INCREASING CHANCES OF CONCEPTION.	2017

6 2005  34 STUDY OF PULMONARY AND AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS OF ASTHMA PATIENTS AFTER YOGA TRAINING. "THE CONCEPT OF YOGA IS HELPFUL FOR THE TREATMENT OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA", HAS CREATED A GREAT INTEREST IN THE MEDICAL RESEARCH FIELD. IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS AND PULMONARY FUNCTIONS ARE IMPROVED IN ASTHMA PATIENTS AFTER SHORT TERM YOGA TRAINING, A STUDY WAS CONDUCTED WITH NINE DIAGNOSED BRONCHIAL ASTHMA PATIENTS. YOGA TRAINING WAS GIVEN FOR SEVEN DAYS IN A CAMP IN ADHYATMA SADHNA KENDRA, NEW DELHI. THE AUTONOMIC FUNCTION TESTS TO MEASURE THE PARASYMPATHETIC REACTIVITY (DEEP BREATHING TEST, VALSALVA MANOUEVER), SYMPATHETIC REACTIVITY (HAND GRIP TEST, COLD PRESSURE TEST), AND PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS FVC, FEV1, PEFR, PIF, BHT AND CE WERE RECORDED BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA TRAINING. THE RESTING HEART RATE AFTER YOGA TRAINING (P < 0.05) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED (89.55 +/- 18.46/MIN TO 76.22 +/- 16.44/MIN). THE SYMPATHETIC REACTIVITY WAS REDUCED FOLLOWING YOGA TRAINING AS INDICATED BY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.01) REDUCTION IN DBP AFTER HGT. THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN PARASYMPATHETIC REACTIVITY. THE FVC, FEV1, PEFR DID NOT SHOW ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. THE PIF (P < 0.01), BHT (P < 0.01) AND CE (P < 0.01) SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. THE RESULTS CLOSELY INDICATED THE REDUCTION IN SYMPATHETIC REACTIVITY AND IMPROVEMENT IN THE PULMONARY VENTILATION BY WAY OF RELAXATION OF VOLUNTARY INSPIRATORY AND EXPIRATORY MUSCLES. THE "COMPREHENSIVE YOGIC LIFE STYLE CHANGE PROGRAMME FOR PATIENTS OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA" HAVE SHOWN SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT EVEN WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD.	1996

YOGIC TECHNIQUES AND AYURVEDIC HERBS HAVE PROVEN THEIR ANTI-DIABETIC POTENTIAL WITHOUT INDUCING UNTOWARD EFFECTS. THE PRESENT STUDY COMBINES AYURVEDIC MEDICATION WITH YOGA TECHNIQUES AS A NEW APPROACH TOWARD HEALING DM. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF NON INSULIN-DEPENDENT DM (NIDDM) AND TO DECREASE THE ORAL DRUG DOSE REQUIREMENT OF GUDUCI GHANA TABLET. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIRTY KNOWN NIDDM PATIENTS OF BOTH GENDERS, WHO WERE ON GUDUCI GHANA (SOLIDIFIED AQUEOUS EXTRACT OF TINOSPORA CORDIFOLIA (WILLD.) MIERS.) TABLETS FROM PAST 2 MONTHS AS AYURVEDIC REMEDY FOR DM WERE SELECTED. ALONG WITH GUDUCI GHANA ADMINISTRATION, THE SUBJECTS WERE INSTRUCTED TO FOLLOW YOGIC PROCEDURES INCLUDING ASANAS, PRANAYAMA, AND SUDDHI KRIYAS. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED FOR 8 WEEKS, WHEREIN FASTING BLOOD SUGAR (FBS) AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD SUGAR (PPBS) LEVELS ALONG WITH RELIEF IN SIGN AND SYMPTOMS WERE ASSESSED AT EVERY 2 WEEKS INTERVALS, AND ACCORDING TO RELIEF IN SIGN AND SYMPTOMS, TAPERING OF DRUG DOSAGE WAS CARRIED OUT. THE OBTAINED DATA WERE ANALYZED STATISTICALLY BY APPLYING PAIRED T-TEST. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS OBTAINED WERE PROMISING AS THE RELIEF IN DIABETIC SYMPTOMATOLOGY WAS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT IN TERMS OF P VALUE. 80.83% REDUCTION IN DOSE OF GUDUCI GHANA TABLETS AND 7.85% AND 8.78% FALL IN FBS AND PPBS LEVELS, RESPECTIVELY, AFTER THE COMPLETE COURSE OF TREATMENT. THE OBTAINED P VALUE SHOWED HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT RESULTS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
8 1176  48 EVALUATION OF GANDHAKADI YOGA AS AN ADJUVANT THERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF BEEJADUSHTIJANYA PANDU (THALASSEMIA MAJOR). INTRODUCTION: THALASSEMIA MAJOR IS A MALIGNANT TYPE OF GENETIC DISORDER AND IRON OVERLOAD IS THE MAIN COMPLICATION OF THE DISEASE WHICH RESULTS DUE TO FREQUENT BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS. GANDHAKADI YOGA HAS BEEN PROVED EFFECTIVE AGAINST IRON OVERLOAD IN EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES AND PILOT VOLUNTARY STUDY, HENCE, TAKEN FOR CLINICAL EVALUATION IN THE PRESENT STUDY. AIM: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF GANDHAKADI YOGA AS AN ADJUVANT THERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THALASSEMIA MAJOR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 46 PATIENTS OF AGE GROUP 2-12 YEARS WERE REGISTERED AND RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS. GROUP A (TRIAL GROUP-GANDHAKADI YOGA WITH BLOOD TRANSFISION (BT)) AND GROUP B (CONTROL GROUP-WITH BT AND IRON CHELATION THERAPY). THE ASSESSMENT WAS DONE BASED ON THE SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE PARAMETERS AFTER12 WEEKS OF TREATMENT, WITH A FOLLOW-UP OF 12 WEEKS. THE DATA OBTAINED IN CLINICAL STUDY WAS ANALYZED USING STUDENT'S "T" TEST. RESULTS: TRIAL DRUG PROVIDED HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT RESULT (P < 0.001) IN MOST OF THE SUBJECTIVE PARAMETERS AND BT INTERVAL WAS PROLONGED. IN GROUP A, THE MAXIMUM IMPROVEMENT WAS FOUND IN THREE PATIENTS (13.04%); MODERATE IMPROVEMENT IN 15 PATIENTS (65.22%) AND MILD IMPROVEMENT IN FIVE PATIENTS (21.74%). NO ADVERSE DRUG REACTION WAS REPORTED DURING THE CLINICAL STUDY. CONCLUSION: GANDHAKADI YOGA PROVIDED BETTER RESULTS THAN CONTROL IN SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE PARAMETERS, BT INTERVAL AND GENERAL HEALTH STATUS, HENCE, HAS AN EFFECTIVE ROLE AS AN ADJUVANT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THALASSEMIA MAJOR.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
9 2905  39 [LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF BREATHING EXERCISES AND YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA]. TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF BREATHING EXERCISES (BE) OR YOGA (Y) ON THE COURSE OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA WE STUDIED 36 SUBJECTS WITH A MILD DISEASE. THE PATIENTS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO 3 GROUPS. 2 OF THEM PARTICIPATED IN A 3 WEEKS TRAINING PROGRAM OF BE OR Y WHILE THE THIRD GROUP RESTED WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL TREATMENT (CONTROL GROUP, C). AT THE END OF THE TRAINING PERIOD THE PATIENTS WERE ASKED TO PRACTISE BE OR Y ON THEIR OWN. DRUG THERAPY AND LUNG FUNCTION PARAMETERS BEFORE AND AFTER A BETA 2-AGONIST METERED DOSE INHALER (ALBUTEROL, ALB) WERE RECORDED PRIOR TO THE TRAINING PROGRAM AND IN 4 WEEKS INTERVALS FOR 4 MONTHS THEREAFTER. THE RESPONSE TO THE BETA 2-AGONIST WAS DOCUMENTED CONTINUOUSLY IN 28 PATIENTS. THE MENTAL STATE OF THE PATIENTS WAS ELUCIDATED BY QUESTIONNAIRES.--PRIOR TO THE STUDY A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF INHALED ALB ON THE FEV1 WAS SHOWN WITHOUT ANY SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN GROUP DIFFERENCES. BOTH, BE AND Y, CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT AMELIORATION OF THE MENTAL STATE BUT ONLY THE BE INDUCED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OF LUNG FUNCTION PARAMETERS COMPARED TO THE INDIVIDUAL BASELINE VALUES. THE FEV1 INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY BY 356.3 +/- 146.2 ML (P < 0.05) AND THE VC BY 225.0 +/- 65.5 ML (P < 0.01). THESE LONG-TERM CHANGES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE ACTUAL RESPONSE TO ALB. BE DECREASED THE RV SIGNIFICANTLY BY 306.3 +/- 111.6 ML (P < 0.05), AN EFFECT SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COMPARED TO THE BETA 2-AGONIST (P < 0.01). BE IN COMBINATION WITH ALB CAUSED AN ADDITIVE EFFECT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	1994	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
10  712  36 EFFECT OF INTEGRATED YOGA ON ANTI-PSYCHOTIC INDUCED SIDE EFFECTS AND COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM SCHIZOPHRENIA. BACKGROUND TWENTY ONE (12 FEMALES) SUBJECTS, DIAGNOSED WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA BY A PSYCHIATRIST USING ICD-10, IN THE AGES 52.87 + 9.5YEARS AND SUFFERING SINCE 24.0 +/- 3.05YEARS WERE RECRUITED INTO THE STUDY FROM A SCHIZOPHRENIA REHABILITATION CENTER IN BENGALURU. METHODS ALL SUBJECTS WERE TAKING ANTI-PSYCHOTIC MEDICATIONS AND WERE IN STABLE STATE FOR MORE THAN A MONTH. PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATIONS WERE KEPT CONSTANT DURING THE STUDY PERIOD. ASSESSMENTS WERE DONE AT THREE POINTS OF TIME: (1) BASELINE, (2) AFTER ONE MONTH OF USUAL ROUTINE (PRE) AND (3) AFTER FIVE MONTHS OF VALIDATED INTEGRATED YOGA (IY) INTERVENTION (POST). VALIDATED 1H YOGA MODULE (CONSISTING OF ASANAS, PRANAYAMA, RELAXATION TECHNIQUES AND CHANTINGS) WAS PRACTICED FOR 5MONTHS, FIVE SESSIONS PER WEEK. ANTIPSYCHOTIC-INDUCED SIDE EFFECTS WERE ASSESSED USING SIMPSON ANGUS SCALE (SAS) AND UDVALG FOR KLINISKE UNDERSOGELSER (UKU) SIDE EFFECT RATING SCALE. COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS (USING TRAIL MAKING TEST A AND B), CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND ANTHROPOMETRY WERE ASSESSED AS SECONDARY VARIABLES. COMPARISONS BETWEEN "PRE" AND "POST" DATA WAS DONE USING PAIRED SAMPLES T-TESTS AFTER SUBTRACTING BASELINE SCORES FROM THEM RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS AT THE END OF FIVE MONTHS, SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DRUG-INDUCED PARKINSONIAN SYMPTOMS (SAS SCORE; P=0.001) AND 38 ITEMS OF UKU SCALE WAS OBSERVED ALONG WITH SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PROCESSING SPEED, EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS AND NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA PATIENTS. NO SIDE EFFECTS OF YOGA WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS THE PRESENT STUDY PROVIDES PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE FOR USEFULNESS OF INTEGRATED YOGA INTERVENTION IN MANAGING ANTI-PSYCHOTIC-INDUCED SIDE EFFECTS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
11  512  39 COMPARATIVE STUDY ON THE EFFECT OF SAPTAMRITA LAUHA AND YOGA THERAPY IN MYOPIA. BACKGROUND: MYOPIA IS VERY COMMON OPHTHALMIC DISEASE ESPECIALLY IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENCE. IN AYURVEDIC TEXTS, ONLY BY THE MAIN FEATURE IMPAIRMENT OF DISTANT VISION MYOPIA CAN BE CORRELATED WITH DRISHTIGATA ROGAS (2(ND) PATALGATA TIMIRA). AIM: TO COMPARE THE EFFECT OF SAPTAMRUTA LAUHA AND YOGA THERAPY IN MYOPIA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IN PRESENT STUDY, A TOTAL 60 PATIENTS WITH AGE GROUP BETWEEN 8 TO 30 YEARS WERE SELECTED RANDOMLY FROM THE OUT-PATIENT DEPARTMENT OF SWASTHAVRITTA AND SHALAKYATANTRA DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT AYURVEDA COLLEGE, TRIVANDRUM, AND WERE DIVIDED IN TWO GROUPS. IN GROUP A, SAPTAMRITA LAUHA 250 MG TWICE DAILY WITH UNEQUAL QUANTITY OF HONEY AND GHRITA WAS ADMINISTERED WHILE IN GROUP B, PATIENTS SUBJECTED TO YOGA THERAPY (JALA NETI, NADI SHODHANA, SHITALI PRANAYAMA AND POINT TRATAK) FOR 3 MONTHS DURATION WITH 1 MONTH FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: THE RESULT OBTAINED FROM THE STUDY REVEALS THAT THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE VISUAL ACUITY AND CLINICAL REFRACTION, BUT ASSOCIATED CHANGES WERE OBSERVED AS REDUCED IN GROUP B WHEN COMPARED TO GROUP A. HOWEVER, RELIEF FROM HEADACHE WAS FOUND TO BE EQUALLY EFFECTIVE IN BOTH THE GROUPS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
12 2771  21 YOGA REDUCES SYMPTOMS OF DISTRESS IN TSUNAMI SURVIVORS IN THE ANDAMAN ISLANDS. A MONTH AFTER THE DECEMBER 2004 TSUNAMI THE EFFECT OF A 1 WEEK YOGA PROGRAM WAS EVALUATED ON SELF RATED FEAR, ANXIETY, SADNESS AND DISTURBED SLEEP IN 47 SURVIVORS IN THE ANDAMAN ISLANDS. POLYGRAPH RECORDINGS OF THE HEART RATE, BREATH RATE AND SKIN RESISTANCE WERE ALSO MADE. AMONG THE 47 PEOPLE, 31 WERE SETTLERS FROM THE MAINLAND (I.E. INDIA, ML GROUP) AND 16 WERE ENDOGENOUS PEOPLE (EP GROUP). THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN SELF RATED FEAR, ANXIETY, SADNESS AND DISTURBED SLEEP IN BOTH GROUPS, AND IN THE HEART AND BREATH RATE IN THE ML GROUP, AND IN THE BREATH RATE ALONE IN THE EP GROUP, FOLLOWING YOGA (P < 0.05, T-TEST). THIS SUGGESTS THAT YOGA PRACTICE MAY BE USEFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF STRESS FOLLOWING A NATURAL DISASTER IN PEOPLE WITH WIDELY DIFFERING SOCIAL, CULTURAL AND SPIRITUAL BELIEFS.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
13   55  44 A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF YOGA WITH PAROXETINE FOR THE TREATMENT OF PREMATURE EJACULATION: A PILOT STUDY. CONTEXT: PREMATURE EJACULATION (PME) IS A COMMON SEXUAL DISORDER. DRUGS USED COMMONLY USED FOR ITS TREATMENT HAVE VARIOUS SIDE EFFECTS AND DISADVANTAGES. YOGA IS BEING INCREASINGLY STUDIED IN A VARIETY OF MEDICAL DISORDERS WITH POSITIVE RESULTS. HOWEVER, ITS EVIDENCE FOR PATIENTS WITH PME IS VERY LIMITED. AIMS: THE AIMS OF THIS STUDY WERE TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON EJACULATION TIME IN PATIENTS WITH PME AND TO COMPARE IT WITH PAROXETINE. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: THIS WAS A NONRANDOMIZED NONBLINDED COMPARATIVE STUDY IN A TERTIARY CARE CENTER. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AMONG PATIENTS WITH PME, 40 SELECTED PAROXETINE AND 28 YOGA. INTRAVAGINAL EJACULATION LATENCY TIME (IELT) WAS MEASURED IN SECONDS ONCE BEFORE AND THREE TIMES AFTER INTERVENTION. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: MEAN, STANDARD DEVIATION, PAIRED AND UNPAIRED T-TESTS, AND REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA WERE USED FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. RESULTS: IELT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN BOTH GROUPS - PAROXETINE (FROM 29.85 +/- 11.9 TO 82.19 +/- 32.9) AND YOGA (FROM 25.88 +/- 16.1 TO 88697 + 26.9). ALTHOUGH THE EFFECT OF YOGA WAS SLIGHTLY DELAYED IN ONSET, ITS EFFECT SIZE (ETA(2) = 0.87, P < 0.05) WAS MORE THAN PAROXETINE (ETA(2) = 0.73, P < 0.05). ONE-FIFTH OF THE PATIENTS IN THE PAROXETINE GROUP (19.5%) AND 8% IN THE YOGA GROUP CONTINUED TO HAVE THE PROBLEM OF PME AT THE END OF THE TRIAL. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA CAUSED IMPROVEMENT IN BOTH INTRAVAGINAL EJACULATION LATENCY TIME AND SUBJECTIVE SEXUAL EXPERIENCE WITH MINIMAL SIDE EFFECT. THEREFORE, YOGA COULD BE AN EASILY ACCESSIBLE ECONOMICAL NONPHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT OPTION FOR THE PATIENT WITH PME.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
14 2363  35 VOLUNTARILY INDUCED VOMITING - A YOGA TECHNIQUE TO ENHANCE PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN HEALTHY HUMANS. VOMITING IS A COMPLEX AUTONOMIC REFLEX ORCHESTRATED BY SEVERAL NEUROLOGICAL CENTRES IN THE BRAIN. VAGUS, THE CRANIAL NERVE PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN REGULATION OF VOMITING. KUNJAL KRIYA (VOLUNTARILY INDUCED VOMITING), IS A YOGIC CLEANSING TECHNIQUE WHICH INVOLVES VOLUNTARILY INDUCING VOMITING AFTER DRINKING SALINE WATER (5%) ON EMPTY STOMACH. THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED WITH AN OBJECTIVE TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECT OF VOLUNTARY INDUCED VOMITING (VIV) ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN EXPERIENCED PRACTITIONERS AND NOVICES AND DERIVE ITS POSSIBLE THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS. EIGHTEEN HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS VOLUNTEERED FOR THE STUDY OF WHICH NINE HAD PRIOR EXPERIENCE OF VIV WHILE NINE DID NOT. PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS WERE PERFORMED BEFORE AND AFTER 10 MIN OF REST FOLLOWING VIV. ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE WAS PERFORMED ADJUSTED FOR GENDER AND BASELINE VALUES. NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE OBSERVED ACROSS GENDERS. THE RESULTS OF THE PRESENT STUDY SUGGEST A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SLOW VITAL CAPACITY [F(1,13) = 5.699; P = 0.03] AND FORCED INSPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1ST SECOND [P = 0.02] AND REDUCTION IN EXPIRATORY RESERVE VOLUME [F(1,13) = 5.029; P = 0.04] AND RESPIRATORY RATE [F(1,13) = 3.244, P = 0.09]. THESE CHANGES SUGGEST THE POSSIBLE ROLE OF VIV IN ENHANCING THE ENDURANCE OF THE RESPIRATORY MUSCLES, DECREASED AIRWAY RESISTANCE, BETTER EMPTYING OF LUNGS AND VAGAL PREDOMINANCE RESPECTIVELY. WE CONCLUDE THAT VIV WHEN PRACTICED REGULARLY ENHANCES THE ENDURANCE OF THE RESPIRATORY MUSCLES AND DECREASES AIRWAY RESISTANCE. THESE FINDINGS ALSO INDICATE NEED FOR SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF VIV IN THE MANAGEMENT OF MOTION SICKNESS AND RESTRICTIVE PULMONARY DISORDERS LIKE BRONCHITIS AND BRONCHIAL ASTHMA.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
15 1468  35 INNER ENGINEERING PRACTICES AND ADVANCED 4-DAY ISHA YOGA RETREAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CANNABIMIMETIC EFFECTS WITH INCREASED ENDOCANNABINOIDS AND SHORT-TERM AND SUSTAINED IMPROVEMENT IN MENTAL HEALTH: A PROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL STUDY OF MEDITATORS. BACKGROUND: ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION ARE COMMON IN THE MODERN WORLD, AND THERE IS GROWING DEMAND FOR ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES SUCH AS MEDITATION. MEDITATION CAN DECREASE PERCEIVED STRESS AND INCREASE GENERAL WELL-BEING, ALTHOUGH THE PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISM IS NOT WELL-CHARACTERIZED. ENDOCANNABINOIDS (ECBS), LIPID MEDIATORS ASSOCIATED WITH ENHANCED MOOD AND REDUCED ANXIETY/DEPRESSION, HAVE NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY STUDIED AS BIOMARKERS OF MEDITATION EFFECTS. OUR AIM WAS TO ASSESS BIOMARKERS (ECBS AND BRAIN-DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR [BDNF]) AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS AFTER A MEDITATION RETREAT. METHODS: THIS WAS AN OBSERVATIONAL PILOT STUDY OF ADULTS BEFORE AND AFTER THE 4-DAY ISHA YOGA BHAVA SPANDANA PROGRAM RETREAT. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED ONLINE SURVEYS (BEFORE AND AFTER RETREAT, AND 1 MONTH LATER) TO ASSESS ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, FOCUS, WELL-BEING, AND HAPPINESS THROUGH VALIDATED PSYCHOLOGICAL SCALES. VOLUNTARY BLOOD SAMPLING FOR BIOMARKER STUDIES WAS DONE BEFORE AND WITHIN A DAY AFTER THE RETREAT. THE BIOMARKERS ANANDAMIDE, 2-ARACHIDONOYLGLYCEROL (2-AG), 1-ARACHIDONOYLGLYCEROL (1-AG), DOCOSATETRAENOYLETHANOLAMIDE (DEA), OLEOYLETHANOLAMIDE (OLA), AND BDNF WERE EVALUATED. PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SCALES, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN ECBS AND BDNF. RESULTS: DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SCORES DECREASED WHILE FOCUS, HAPPINESS, AND POSITIVE WELL-BEING SCORES INCREASED IMMEDIATELY AFTER RETREAT FROM THEIR BASELINE VALUES (P < 0.001). ALL IMPROVEMENTS WERE SUSTAINED 1 MONTH AFTER BSP. ALL MAJOR ECBS INCLUDING ANANDAMIDE, 2-AG, 1-AG, DEA, AND BDNF INCREASED AFTER MEDITATION BY > 70% (P < 0.001). INCREASES OF >/=20% IN ANANDAMIDE, 2-AG, 1-AG, AND TOTAL AG LEVELS AFTER MEDITATION FROM THE BASELINE HAD WEAK CORRELATIONS WITH CHANGES IN HAPPINESS AND WELL-BEING. CONCLUSIONS: A SHORT MEDITATION EXPERIENCE IMPROVED FOCUS, HAPPINESS, AND POSITIVE WELL-BEING AND REDUCED DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY IN PARTICIPANTS FOR AT LEAST 1 MONTH. PARTICIPANTS HAD INCREASED BLOOD ECBS AND BDNF, SUGGESTING A ROLE FOR THESE BIOMARKERS IN THE UNDERLYING MECHANISM OF MEDITATION. MEDITATION IS A SIMPLE, ORGANIC, AND EFFECTIVE WAY TO IMPROVE WELL-BEING AND REDUCE DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY.	2020	

16 2396  16 YOGA AND CHEMOREFLEX RESPONSE TO HYPOXIA AND HYPERCAPNIA. WE TESTED WHETHER CHEMOREFLEX SENSITIVITY COULD BE AFFECTED BY THE PRACTICE OF YOGA, AND WHETHER THIS IS SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF A SLOW BREATHING RATE OBTAINED DURING YOGA OR AS A GENERAL CONSEQUENCE OF YOGA. WE FOUND THAT SLOW BREATHING RATE PER SE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED CHEMOREFLEX SENSITIVITY, BUT LONG-TERM YOGA PRACTICE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR A GENERALISED REDUCTION IN CHEMOREFLEX.	2000	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
17  918  20 EFFECTIVENESS OF TRAINING PROGRAM COMBINING CHAKRAYOGA AND MEDITATION. BACKGROUND THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PROGRAM COMBINING CHAKRAYOGA AND MEDITATION ON THE PHYSICAL HEALTH AND DISEASE-RELATED FACTORS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS OF PEOPLE. METHODS NINETY-SEVEN SUBJECTS (32-83 YEARS OLD) WHO HAD FREE FROM PRIOR EXPERIENCES IN MEDITATION PROGRAMS OR CHAKRAYOGA TRAINING COURSES WERE ASSIGNED TO EITHER THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (EXP) (45 SUBJECTS; 13 MALE SUBJECTS AND 32 FEMALE SUBJECTS; AVERAGE AGE OF 60.67 YEARS, SD=11.09 YEARS) OR THE CONTROL GROUP (CONT) OF REMAINING SUBJECTS (52 SUBJECTS; 14 MALE SUBJECTS AND 38 FEMALE SUBJECTS; AVERAGE AGE OF 61.58 YEARS, SD=9.70 YEARS). SUBJECTS IN THE EXP PARTICIPATED IN THE CHAKRAYOGA MEDITATION PROGRAM FOR TWICE A WEEK FOR 2 H DURING 6 WEEKS IN EACH SESSION CONSISTED OF 1 H OF CHAKRAYOGA AND 1 H OF MEDITATION.

18 1932  36 ROLE OF YOGA IN MODIFYING ANXIETY LEVEL IN WOMEN. ANXIETY LEADS TO DERANGEMENT IN PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. ANXIETY LEVELS ARE MORE IN FULL TIME HOUSEWIVES THAN WORKING WOMEN. THERE IS A NEED FOR SIMPLE, EASY TREATMENT FOR ANXIETY TO ALLEVIATE THE BURDEN ON HEALTH CAUSED BY ANXIETY. YOGA IS AMONG THE TOP TEN COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE THERAPIES. OUR STUDY AIMED TO DETERMINE THE ANXIETY LEVELS IN APPARENTLY HEALTHY FULL TIME HOUSEWIVES AND TO STUDY THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON ANXIETY LEVELS AMONG THEM. PRESENT STUDY IS A COMPARATIVE INTERVENTIONAL STUDY. STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON 50 APPARENTLY HEALTHY FULL TIME HOUSEWIVES (20-50 YEARS) WHO ATTENDED ONE MONTH YOGA CAMP. HAMILTON ANXIETY (HAMA) SCALE WAS USED TO EVALUATE ANXIETY LEVELS BEFORE AND AT THE END OF THE YOGA CAMP. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS DONE BY PAIRED T TEST USING SPSS 9.0. THE BASELINE PULSE RATE, SBP, DBP WERE 82.90 +/- 4.25 BPM, 124.84 +/- 11.022 MM HG, 85.20 +/- 10.81 MM HG RESPECTIVELY. AFTER FOUR WEEKS YOGA CAMP THERE WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT LOWERING OF PULSE RATE (77.58 +/- 3.86 BPM), SBP (117.92 +/- 6.76 MM HG), DBP (78.68 +/- 6.62 MM HG). BEFORE YOGA TRAINING, PERCENTAGE DISTRIBUTIONS OF SUBJECTS WITH MILD, MODERATE AND SEVERE ANXIETY WERE 6%, 18% AND 76% RESPECTIVELY. AT THE END OF FOUR WEEK YOGA TRAINING, PERCENTAGE DISTRIBUTIONS OF SUBJECTS WITH MILD, MODERATE AND SEVERE ANXIETY WERE 44.23%, 19.23% AND 36.53% RESPECTIVELY. THERE WAS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT (P = 0.000) DIFFERENCE IN THE MEAN VALUES OF TOTAL SCORE BEFORE (33.71 +/- 4.90) AND AFTER (26.93 +/- 4.53) YOGA. THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THERE WAS A REDUCTION IN THE SEVERITY OF ANXIETY FROM SEVERE TO MODERATE AND MILD INDICATING DECREASE IN ANXIETY FOLLOWING YOGA. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF OUR STUDY, WE CONCLUDE THAT REGULAR YOGIC PRACTICES AND ADAPTING AND IMPLEMENTING THE PRINCIPALS AND PHILOSOPHY OF YOGA IN DAY TO DAY LIFE MAY DECREASE THE ANXIETY LEVEL.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
19 2115  30 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH HAEMOPHILIA. THE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY HAEMOPHILIA LEAD TO IMPAIRMENTS OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH HAEMOPHILIA. THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH HAEMOPHILIA IN SHIRAZ, IRAN. THIS SEMI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WITH PRE- AND POST-TEST DESIGN WAS PERFORMED ON 27 BOYS BETWEEN 8 AND 16 YEARS OLD WHO SUFFERED FROM HAEMOPHILIA. THE PATIENTS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS. THE NUMBER OF BLEEDINGS, ABSENCES FROM SCHOOL, AND REFERRALS TO THE CLINIC WAS EVALUATED. THE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH INTERVIEWS AND USING THE PATIENTS' RECORDS IN THE HAEMOPHILIA CENTER. BESIDES, THE QUALITY OF LIFE WAS ASSESSED THROUGH THE HAEMO-QOL QUESTIONNAIRE. THEN, THE YOGA INTERVENTION WAS PERFORMED FOR 14 WEEKS AND THE DATA WERE COLLECTED IN THREE STAGES. THE COLLECTED DATA WERE ENTERED INTO THE SPSS STATISTICAL SOFTWARE, VERSION 18 AND WERE ANALYZED USING NON-PARAMETRIC FRIEDMAN TEST. AFTER THE INTERVENTION, SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED IN THE MEAN SCORES OF QUALITY OF LIFE DIMENSIONS AND THE NUMBER OF BLEEDINGS, SCHOOL ABSENCES, AND REFERRALS TO THE HAEMOPHILIA CLINIC (P<0.001). THUS, YOGA MAY IMPROVE THE HAEMOPHILIA CHILDREN'S AND ADOLESCENTS' PERCEPTION OF QUALITY OF LIFE WITHOUT THE RISK OF INJURY. THIS INTERVENTION ALSO SEEMED TO BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE NUMBER OF BLEEDINGS, REFERRALS TO THE HAEMOPHILIA CLINIC, AND ABSENCES FROM SCHOOL.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
20 1272  31 FROM 200 BC TO 2015 AD: AN INTEGRATION OF ROBOTIC SURGERY AND AYURVEDA/YOGA. BACKGROUND: AMONG THE TRADITIONAL SYSTEMS OF MEDICINE PRACTICED ALL OVER THE WORLD, AYURVEDA AND YOGA HAS A DOCUMENTED HISTORY DATING BACK TO BEYOND 200 BC. ROBOTIC AND VIDEO ASSISTED THORACIC SURGERY (VATS) IS AN INVENTION OF THE 21(ST) CENTURY. WE AIM TO QUANTIFY THE EFFECTS OF INTEGRATION OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA ON PATIENTS UNDERGOING MINIMALLY INVASIVE ROBOTIC AND VATS. METHODS: FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY-FOUR PATIENTS UNDERGOING VATS AND ROBOTIC THORACIC SURGERY WERE INTRODUCED TO A PRE AND POSTOPERATIVE PROTOCOL OF YOGA THERAPY, MEDIATION AND OIL MASSAGES. YOGA EXERCISES INCLUDED PRANAYAM, ANULOM VILOM, AND OIL MASSAGES INCLUDED UROTARPAN. PREOPERATIVE AND POSTOPERATIVE RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS WERE RECORDED. PATIENT SATISFACTION QUESTIONNAIRE WERE NOTED. STATISTICAL COMPARISON WAS MADE TO CONTROL GROUP UNDERGOING MINIMALLY INVASIVE THORACIC SURGERY WITHOUT INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE. ONLY ONE PATIENT REFUSED TO UNDERGO AYURVEDA THERAPY AND WAS DELETED FROM THE GROUP. RESULTS: ACCEPTABILITY WAS HIGH AMONG ALL PATIENTS. PREOPERATIVE TRAINING LED TO IMPLEMENTATION AS EARLY AS 6 HOURS POST SURGERY. PULMONARY FUNCTION TEST SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. ALL PATIENTS SUGGESTED AN IMPROVEMENT IN SATISFACTION SCORE. PAIN SCORE WERE LESS IN STUDY PATIENTS. QUICKER MOBILIZATION LED TO EARLY DISCHARGE AND DRAIN REMOVAL. CHRONIC PAIN WAS PREVENTED IN PATIENTS HAVING OIL MASSAGES OVER THE HEALED WOUND SITES. CONCLUSIONS: INTEGRATION OF AYURVEDA, YOGA AND MINIMALLY INVASIVE ROBOTIC AND VATS IS ACCEPTABLE TO INDIAN PATIENTS AND GIVES BETTER CLINICAL RESULTS AND HIGHER PATIENT SATISFACTION.	2016

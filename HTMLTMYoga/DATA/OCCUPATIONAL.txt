1  256 148 A YOGA-BASED PROGRAM DECREASES PHYSICIAN BURNOUT IN NEONATOLOGISTS AND OBSTETRICIANS AT AN ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER. BACKGROUND: NEARLY HALF OF U.S. PEDIATRICIANS HAVE SYMPTOMS OF BURNOUT. THIS PILOT STUDY EXAMINED THE FEASIBILITY OF A 6-WEEK YOGA-BASED PROGRAM (RISE) FOR NEONATOLOGISTS AND OBSTETRICIANS AT BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL AND STUDIED THE EFFECTS ON BURNOUT, PROFESSIONAL FULFILLMENT, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED VIA EMAIL TO PARTICIPATE EITHER IN BOTH PROGRAM AND RESEARCH STUDY, OR EXCLUSIVELY THE PROGRAM. RISE WAS DELIVERED 1 HOUR/WEEK DURING THE WORKDAY FOR 6 CONSECUTIVE WEEKS EITHER IN-PERSON OR REMOTELY; 18 PHYSICIANS PARTICIPATED, 12 COMPLETED POST-PROGRAM, AND 11 COMPLETED 2-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. THE QUESTIONNAIRES ASSESSED BURNOUT AND MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH, PROFESSIONAL FULFILLMENT, WORK EXHAUSTION, INTERPERSONAL DISENGAGEMENT/BURNOUT (PFI), MINDFULNESS (FFMQ), PERCEIVED STRESS (PSS), POSITIVE/NEGATIVE AFFECT (PANAS), RESILIENCE (RS), ANXIETY/DEPRESSION/SLEEP DISTURBANCES (PROMIS), AT BASELINE, POST-PROGRAM, AND 2 MONTHS AFTER RISE. FINDINGS: AVERAGE ATTENDANCE IN-PERSON WAS 2.8 SESSIONS AND REMOTELY 1.4 SESSIONS (4.2/6 SESSIONS). PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATING TOTAL BURNOUT REDUCED FROM 50.0% AT BASELINE TO 9.1% POST-PROGRAM. PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATING PROFESSIONAL FULFILLMENT WERE 8.3% AT BASELINE AND 27.3% POST-PROGRAM. PAIRED SAMPLES T-TESTS REVEALED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN BURNOUT, PROFESSIONAL FULFILLMENT, INTERPERSONAL DISENGAGEMENT, STRESS, RESILIENCE, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION AT POST-PROGRAM COMPARED WITH BASELINE (N = 12, ALL PS < .05). AT 2-MONTH FOLLOW-UP, STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN INTERPERSONAL DISENGAGEMENT, RESILIENCE, AND MINDFULNESS (N = 11, ALL PS < .05) COMPARED WITH BASELINE WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS/APPLICATION TO PRACTICE: RISE IS FEASIBLE WITHIN A WORKDAY AND MAY ADDRESS BURNOUT AND OTHER PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH MEASURES IN PHYSICIANS WITH EFFECTS POTENTIALLY SUSTAINABLE OVER 2 MONTHS. OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH PRACTITIONERS IN HEALTH CARE SHOULD CONSIDER THIS TYPE OF INTERVENTION FOR THEIR WORKERS.	2020	

2   38  48 A 3-DAY RESIDENTIAL YOGA-BASED PROGRAM IMPROVES EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS' PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH IN A SINGLE ARM TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY EXAMINED CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH IN URBAN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS AFTER ATTENDING A BRIEF YOGA-BASED PROGRAM. METHODS: EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS FROM THE NEW YORK CITY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION (NYC DOE) WHO WERE ATTENDING A RESIDENTIAL 3-DAY YOGA-BASED PROGRAM AT KRIPALU CENTER FOR YOGA & HEALTH WERE RECRUITED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY. MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND HEALTH-RELATED BEHAVIORS WERE COMPLETED BEFORE (BASELINE), AFTER (POST), AND TWO MONTHS AFTER THE PROGRAM (FOLLOW-UP). PAIRED SAMPLES T-TESTS WERE USED TO COMPARE SCORES BETWEEN TIME POINTS. RESULTS: AT POST, PARTICIPANTS (N=74) SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS IN STRESS, RESILIENCE, AFFECT, MINDFULNESS, EMPOWERMENT, SELF-COMPASSION, SATISFACTION WITH LIFE, WORK ENGAGEMENT, BURNOUT, EXERCISE, AND VEGETABLE INTAKE (ALL P VALUES < 0.05) COMPARED TO BASELINE. AT THE FOLLOW-UP (N=33), SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS IN RESILIENCE, AFFECT, MINDFULNESS, EMPOWERMENT, SELF-COMPASSION, WORK ENGAGEMENT, AND BURNOUT (ALL P VALUES < 0.05) COMPARED TO BASELINE. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS BETWEEN THE DEGREE OF HOME PRACTICE OF THE SKILLS AND TECHNIQUES LEARNED IN THE PROGRAM AND IMPROVEMENTS IN MULTIPLE MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AT FOLLOW-UP (ALL P VALUES < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE YOGA-BASED PROGRAM IMPROVES PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND HEALTHY BEHAVIORS IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE PROGRAM AND UP TO TWO-MONTHS FOLLOWING THE PROGRAM, HOWEVER, MORE DATA WITH LARGER SAMPLE SIZES ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM SUSTAINED BENEFITS OVER THE LONGER TERM.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
3 2519  43 YOGA COMPLEMENTED COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY ON JOB BURNOUT AMONG TEACHERS OF CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: JOB BURNOUT IS A SYNDROME OF REACTION TO CHRONIC JOB-RELATED STRESS WHICH AFFECTS OVERALL HEALTH, LIMITS OCCUPATIONAL EFFICACY, AND PERSONAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF EMPLOYEES THEREBY THWARTING ORGANIZATIONAL OUTCOMES. BURNOUT SYMPTOMS ARE COMMON AMONG TEACHERS OF CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS (ASD) AND AFFECT THE ACADEMIC PROGRESS OF THE CHILDREN. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA-BASED COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (Y-CBT) IN REDUCING OCCUPATIONAL BURNOUT AMONG TEACHERS OF CHILDREN WITH AUTISM IN LAGOS STATES, NIGERIA. METHODS: A GROUP-RANDOMIZED CONTROL-TRIAL WITH IMMEDIATE INTERVENTION AND WAITLIST CONTROL GROUPS WAS DESIGN WAS ADOPTED. PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED 58 TEACHERS OF CHILDREN WITH AUTISM IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SPECIAL SCHOOLS IN THE AREA. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO Y-CBT (N = 29) AND WAITLIST CONTROL (N = 29) GROUPS. THE Y-CBT GROUP PARTICIPATED IN A 2 HOURS Y-CBT PROGRAM WEEKLY FOR 12 WEEKS. THREE INSTRUMENTS DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLE, SINGLE ITEM STRESS QUESTIONNAIRE (SISQ), AND MASLACH BURNOUT INVENTORY-EDUCATORS' SURVEY (MBI-ES) WERE USED TO COLLECT DATA. DATA WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE; POST-TEST AND FOLLOW-UP EVALUATIONS. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING MEANS, STANDARD DEVIATIONS, T TEST STATISTICS, REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE, AND BAR CHARTS. RESULTS: RESULTS REVEALED THAT JOB-BURNOUT REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY AT POST-TEST ASSESSMENT AMONG THE Y-CBT GROUP COMPARED TO THE WAITLISTED GROUP. THE REDUCTION IN THE PARTICIPANT WAS SUSTAINED ACROSS 3MONTHS FOLLOW-UP EVALUATION. CONCLUSION: IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT Y-CBT MODALITIES COULD HELP TO REDUCE THE BURNOUT SYMPTOMS AMONG TEACHERS OF CHILDREN WITH ASD.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
4 1428  57 IMPROVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING FOLLOWING A BRIEF YOGA-BASED PROGRAM FOR EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS WHO ATTENDED A YOGA-BASED PROGRAM. METHODS: EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS WHO ATTENDED A 3-DAY YOGA-BASED RISE (RESILIENCE, INTEGRATION, SELF-AWARENESS, ENGAGEMENT) PROGRAM WERE RECRUITED TO PARTICIPATE. RISE WAS ADMINISTERED AT THE KRIPALU CENTER FOR YOGA & HEALTH. MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING, AND HEALTH-RELATED BEHAVIORS WERE COMPLETED BEFORE (BASELINE), AFTER (POST), AND 2 MONTHS AFTER RISE (FOLLOW-UP). FORTY-FOUR PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED BASELINE AND POST AND WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. OF THOSE, 33 PARTICIPANTS ALSO COMPLETED THE FOLLOW-UP. PAIRED SAMPLES T TESTS WERE USED TO COMPARE SCORES BETWEEN TIME POINTS. RESULTS: COMPARED TO BASELINE, AT POST, PARTICIPANTS SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS IN PERCEIVED STRESS, MINDFULNESS, EMPOWERMENT, POSITIVE AFFECT, NEGATIVE AFFECT, SELF-COMPASSION, TOTAL WORK ENGAGEMENT, VIGOR, SLEEP QUALITY (ALL P VALUES < .001), RESILIENCE, SATISFACTION WITH LIFE, AS WELL AS EXHAUSTION AND PROFESSIONAL EFFICACY WHICH ARE DIMENSIONS OF BURNOUT (ALL P VALUES < .01). AT THE FOLLOW-UP, SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE MAINTAINED FOR MINDFULNESS, EMPOWERMENT, SELF-COMPASSION, SLEEP QUALITY (ALL P VALUES < .001), RESILIENCE, VIGOR, AND EXHAUSTION (ALL P VALUES < .01) AND POSITIVE AFFECT, SATISFACTION WITH LIFE, AND WORK ENGAGEMENT (ALL P VALUES < .05). CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE YOGA-BASED RISE PROGRAM IMPROVES PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS. IN ADDITION, PARTICIPANTS REPORTED THAT ATTENDING RISE WAS FEASIBLE, THEY COULD CONTINUE USING RISE PRACTICES LONG-TERM, SHARED THEM WITH WORK COLLEAGUES, AND REPORTED THAT RISE POSITIVELY IMPACTED BOTH THEIR DAILY LIVES AND WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT. WITH THESE PROMISING RESULTS, ADDITIONAL CONTROLLED RESEARCH IS WARRANTED.	2019

6 1572  39 MANAGING JOB STRESS AMONG TEACHERS OF CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY WITH YOGA. BACKGROUND: JOB-RELATED STRESS UNDERMINES OCCUPATIONAL, PERSONAL, AND ORGANIZATIONAL OUTCOMES. STRESS SYMPTOMS ARE COMMON AMONG TEACHERS OF CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS AND AFFECT THE ACADEMIC PROGRESS OF THE CHILDREN. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA-BASED COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY IN REDUCING OCCUPATIONAL STRESS AMONG TEACHERS OF CHILDREN WITH AUTISM IN LAGOS STATES, NIGERIA. METHODS: THE CURRENT STUDY ADOPTED A GROUP-RANDOMIZED WAITLIST CONTROL (WLC) TRIAL DESIGN WITH PRE-TEST, POSTTEST, AND FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENTS. PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED 58 TEACHERS OF CHILDREN WITH AUTISM IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SPECIAL SCHOOLS IN LAGOS STATE. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO COMBINED COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY AND YOGA (Y-CBT) (N = 29) AND WLC (N = 29) GROUPS. THE Y-CBT GROUP PARTICIPATED IN A 2 HOURS Y-CBT PROGRAM WEEKLY FOR 12 WEEKS. THREE INSTRUMENTS - DEMOGRAPHIC QUESTIONNAIRE, SINGLE-ITEM STRESS QUESTIONNAIRE, AND TEACHERS' STRESS INVENTORY (TSI) WERE USED TO COLLECT DATA. DATA WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE; POSTTEST AND FOLLOW-UP EVALUATIONS. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING MEANS, STANDARD DEVIATIONS, T TEST STATISTICS, REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE, AND BAR CHARTS. RESULTS: RESULTS REVEALED THAT ALL DIMENSIONS OF JOB STRESS (PERCEPTION OF STRESS SOURCES, STRESS MANIFESTATION, AND TOTAL TSI SCORES) REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY AT POSTTEST AND FOLLOW UP ASSESSMENTS AMONG THE Y-CBT GROUP, COMPARED TO THE WLC. CONCLUSION: IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT Y-CBT MODALITIES COULD HELP TO MINIMIZE THE PERCEPTION OF STRESS SOURCES AND STRESS MANIFESTATION AS WELL AS TOTAL TSI SCORES AMONG TEACHERS OF CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
7 2017  32 SURVEY ON UTILITY OF YOGA AS AN ALTERNATIVE THERAPY FOR OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS AMONG DENTAL PRACTIONERS. BACKGROUND: THE THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL OF YOGA ARE OFTEN CONSIDERED COMPLEMENTARY TO VARIOUS FORMS OF MEDICAL PRACTICE. VERY FEW STUDIES HAVE EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN THE TREATMENT OF OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS AMONG DENTISTS. HENCE, THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE THE ADOPTION OF YOGA TECHINQUES AS AN ALTERNATIVE THERAPY IN TREATMENT OF PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS AMONG DENTAL GENERAL PRACTITIONERS IN CHENNAI, INDIA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A VALIDATED CLOSED-ENDED QUESTIONNAIRE WAS CIRCULATED TO 500 DENTAL GENERAL PRACTITIONERS IN CHENNAI, INDIA AND WE RECEIVED 394 COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES. THE QUESTIONNAIRE DOCUMENTED DEMOGRAPHIC DATA, OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS AND THE TYPE OF TREATMENT TAKEN FOR THE HAZARDS. RESULTS: MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN WITH STRESS (47%) WAS THE MOST COMMON OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD REPORTED, FOLLOWED BY ONLY STRESS (27.4%), AND ONLY MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN (25.6%). ONLY 9.6% OF PRACTITIONERS ADOPTED YOGA AS AN ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT FOR THESE OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS. INTERESTINGLY, MAJORITY (46.4%) OF THEM DID EXERCISE, GYM, MASSAGE, WALKING AND HEARD MUSIC. SURPRISINGLY, 43.9% DID NOT TAKE ANY MEASURES TO TREAT THESE OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS. HOWEVER 53.3% OF THE DENTISTS WHO DID NOT CONSIDER YOGA AS AN ALTERNATIVE THERAPY, STATED LACK OF TIME AS A REASON FOR NOT PRACTICING YOGA WHILE 17.6% OF THEM DON'T BELIEVE YOGA AS A THERAPY. CONCLUSION: DESPITE MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN AND STRESS BEING THE MOST COMMON OCCUPATIONAL HAZARD PREVALENT AMONG DENTISTS, OVER 50% OF THE SUBJECTS SURVEYED DIDN'T SEEK ANY MEASURE TO TREAT THESE OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS AND ONLY 10% OF THEM PRACTICED YOGA AS THE ALTERNATIVE THERAPY.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
8 1607  28 MERGING YOGA AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE: A FEASIBILITY AND PILOT PROGRAM. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS FEASIBILITY AND CHANGES IN OUTCOME MEASURES FOLLOWING THE MERGING YOGA AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE (MY-OT FOR PD) PROGRAM: A 14-SESSION PROGRAM WHICH COMBINED COMMUNITY-BASED YOGA FOR PD, AND FALL-RISK FOCUSED GROUP OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY SESSIONS. SEVENTEEN PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED AN 8-WEEK CONTROL PERIOD CONSISTING OF THEIR NORMAL PARTICIPATION, AND AN 8-WEEK INTERVENTION PERIOD (14 MY-OT FOR PD SESSIONS). THERE WERE FEWER SELF-REPORTED FALLS IN THE INTERVENTION (6) VS. CONTROL PERIODS (10). ONE FALL RISK FACTOR MANAGEMENT SCALE (THE FALL PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT QUESTIONNAIRE, P=.02), AND BALANCE (P<.01) SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT BETWEEN THE CONTROL AND INTERVENTION. THE MY-OT FOR PD PROGRAM IS AN ENCOURAGING OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST-LED PROGRAM, WHICH MAY IMPROVE BALANCE AND REDUCE SELF-REPORTED FALLS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
9 1429  42 IMPROVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING IN A PRAGMATIC CONTROLLED TRIAL OF A YOGA-BASED PROGRAM FOR PROFESSIONALS. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PRAGMATIC CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING IN PROFESSIONALS WHO ATTENDED A YOGA-BASED PROGRAM. SETTING: THE 5-DAY RISE (RESILIENCE, INTEGRATION, SELF-AWARENESS, ENGAGEMENT) PROGRAM WAS DELIVERED AT THE KRIPALU CENTER FOR YOGA & HEALTH. RISE INCLUDED 5 H PER DAY OF YOGA, MEDITATION, LECTURES, AND EXPERIENTIAL ACTIVITIES. SUBJECTS: ADULT PROFESSIONALS FROM EDUCATION, CORRECTIONS, AND SOCIAL SERVICE INSTITUTIONS WERE PRAGMATICALLY ASSIGNED TO THE RISE GROUP (N = 61) OR A WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 60). OUTCOME MEASURES: MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING WERE COMPLETED BEFORE RISE (BASELINE), IMMEDIATELY AFTER RISE (POSTPROGRAM), AND 2 MONTHS AFTER RISE (FOLLOW-UP). ANALYSES OF COVARIANCE WERE CONDUCTED TO COMPARE CHANGE SCORES BETWEEN GROUPS. RESULTS: EIGHTY-TWO PARTICIPANTS (RISE N = 41, CONTROL N = 41) COMPLETED BASELINE AND POSTMEASURES AND WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS, AND 57 (RISE N = 27, CONTROL N = 30) ALSO COMPLETED THE FOLLOW-UP. RELATIVE TO CONTROLS, THE RISE GROUP REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN STRESS (P = 0.001, R(2) = 0.51), RESILIENCE (P = 0.028, R(2) = 0.34), POSITIVE AFFECT (P = 0.001, R(2) = 0.52), NEGATIVE AFFECT (P = 0.001, R(2) = 0.52), MINDFULNESS (P = 0.021, R(2) = 0.13), AND JOB SATISFACTION (P = 0.034, R(2) = 0.08) FROM BASELINE TO POSTPROGRAM. FROM BASELINE TO FOLLOW-UP, COMPARED WITH CONTROLS THE RISE GROUP SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS IN STRESS (P = 0.001, R(2) = 0.33), RESILIENCE (P = 0.001, R(2) = 0.24), POSITIVE AFFECT (P = 0.006, R(2) = 0.49), NEGATIVE AFFECT (P = 0.043, R(2) = 0.32), MINDFULNESS (P = 0.001, R(2) = 0.28), EMPOWERMENT (P = 0.005, R(2) = 0.20), AND SELF-COMPASSION (P = 0.011, R(2) = 0.19). CONCLUSIONS: THE RISE PROGRAM WAS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING IMMEDIATELY AFTER AND 2 MONTHS AFTER THE PROGRAM. FUTURE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE RESULTS.	2019	
                                             
10 1430  48 IMPROVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH FOLLOWING A RESIDENTIAL YOGA-BASED PROGRAM FOR FRONTLINE PROFESSIONALS. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF A RESIDENTIAL YOGA-BASED PROGRAM ON PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH AND HEALTH BEHAVIORS IN FRONTLINE PROFESSIONALS. METHODS: FRONTLINE PROFESSIONALS FROM EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE, HUMAN SERVICES, AND CORRECTIONS PARTICIPATED IN THE RISE (RESILIENCE, INTEGRATION, SELF-AWARENESS, ENGAGEMENT) PROGRAM AND COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES AT BASELINE, POST-PROGRAM, AND 2 MONTHS FOLLOWING RISE. RESULTS: PAIRED SAMPLES T TESTS REVEALED IMPROVEMENTS IN MINDFULNESS, STRESS, RESILIENCE, AFFECT, AND SLEEP QUALITY FROM BASELINE TO POST-PROGRAM (ALL PS < 0.001, N = 55), WHICH WERE SUSTAINED AT THE 2-MONTH FOLLOW-UP (ALL PS < 0.01, N = 40). PARTICIPANTS ALSO REPORTED INCREASES IN EXERCISE, FRUIT, AND VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION POST-PROGRAM (ALL PS < 0.001), ALL OF WHICH PERSISTED AT THE 2-MONTH FOLLOW-UP (ALL PS < 0.01) EXCEPT EXERCISE. CONCLUSION: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT RISE IMPROVED INDICES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH AND HEALTHY BEHAVIORS THAT REMAINED 2 MONTHS FOLLOWING RISE.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
11 1367  33 IMPACT OF A MINDFULNESS-BASED, WORKPLACE GROUP YOGA INTERVENTION ON BURNOUT, SELF-CARE, AND COMPASSION IN HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER A WORKPLACE, GROUP MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION COULD HELP MANAGE BURNOUT AND IMPROVE WELLBEING AMONG HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 43 HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS PARTICIPATED IN 8-WEEK SUPERVISED WORKPLACE, GROUP MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA ACTIVITIES. THE AUTHORS USED A SINGLE-SAMPLE, PRE-POST DESIGN. AT TWO POINTS IN TIME (BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION), PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED A SET OF ONLINE MEASURES ASSESSING BURNOUT, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, STRESS, RESILIENCE, AND COMPASSION. THE AUTHORS USED LINEAR MIXED MODEL ANALYSIS TO ASSESS CHANGES IN OUTCOME MEASURES. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS HAD IMPROVEMENTS AFTER THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION. AT POSTINTERVENTION, THEY HAD SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER SCORES ON PERSONAL ACCOMPLISHMENT, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, STRESS, PERCEIVED RESILIENCE, AND COMPASSION. PARTICIPANTS HAD A POSITIVE PERCEPTION OF THE YOGA INTERVENTION. CONCLUSION: GROUP MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA PROGRAM MAY BE CONVENIENT AND LOW-COST APPROACH TO SUPPORT HEALTH AND WELLBEING AMONG HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
12 1729  42 PERSONALISED YOGA FOR BURNOUT AND TRAUMATIC STRESS IN JUNIOR DOCTORS. OBJECTIVES: JUNIOR DOCTORS ARE FREQUENTLY EXPOSED TO OCCUPATIONAL AND TRAUMATIC STRESS, SOMETIMES WITH TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES. MINDFULNESS-BASED AND FITNESS INTERVENTIONS ARE INCREASINGLY USED TO MITIGATE THIS, BUT HAVE NOT BEEN COMPARED.WE CONDUCTED A RANDOMISED, CONTROLLED PILOT TRIAL TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE INTERVENTIONS IN JUNIOR DOCTORS. METHODS: WE RANDOMISED PARTICIPANTS (N=21) TO WEEKLY 1-HOUR SESSIONS OF PERSONALISED, TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA (N=10), WITH A 4-HOUR WORKSHOP, AND EHEALTH HOMEWORK; OR GROUP-FORMAT FITNESS (N=8) IN AN EXISTING WELLNESS PROGRAMME, MDOK. BURNOUT, TRAUMATIC STRESS AND SUICIDALITY WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE AND 8 WEEKS. RESULTS: BOTH INTERVENTIONS REDUCED BURNOUT, AND YOGA INCREASED COMPASSION SATISFACTION WITHIN GROUP ON THE PROFESSIONAL QUALITY OF LIFE SCALE, WITHOUT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS ON THIS MEASURE.PERSONALISED YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED DEPERSONALISATION (Z=-1.99, P=0.05) COMPARED WITH GROUP FITNESS ON THE MASLACH BURNOUT INVENTORY (MBI-HSS (MP)) AND SHOWED GREATER FLEXIBILITY CHANGES. BOTH INTERVENTIONS INCREASED MBI PERSONAL ACCOMPLISHMENT, WITH NO CHANGES IN OTHER SELF-REPORT PSYCHOLOGICAL OR PHYSIOLOGICAL METRICS, INCLUDING BREATH-COUNTING.PARTICIPANTS DOING ONE-TO-ONE YOGA RATED IT MORE HIGHLY OVERALL (P=0.02) THAN GROUP FITNESS, AND REPORTED IT COMPARATIVELY MORE BENEFICIAL FOR MENTAL (P=0.01) AND PHYSICAL HEALTH (P=0.05). FACE-TO-FACE WEEKLY SESSIONS WERE 100% ATTENDED IN YOGA, BUT ONLY 45% IN FITNESS. CONCLUSION: IN THIS PILOT TRIAL, BOTH YOGA AND FITNESS IMPROVED BURNOUT, BUT TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA REDUCED DEPERSONALISATION IN JUNIOR DOCTORS MORE THAN GROUP-FORMAT FITNESS. ONE-TO-ONE YOGA WAS BETTER ADHERED THAN FITNESS, BUT WAS MORE RESOURCE INTENSIVE. JUNIOR DOCTORS NEED LARGER-SCALE COMPARATIVE RESEARCH OF THE EFFECTIVENESS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF INDIVIDUAL, ORGANISATIONAL AND SYSTEMIC MENTAL HEALTH INTERVENTIONS.

13   12  38 "MERGING YOGA AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY (MY-OT): A FEASIBILITY AND PILOT STUDY". OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND BENEFITS OF THE MERGING YOGA AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY (MY-OT) INTERVENTION. DESIGN: THIS IS THE PRIMARY ANALYSIS OF A NON-CONTROLLED PRETEST-POSTTEST PILOT STUDY TO UNDERSTAND THE FEASIBILITY AND IMPACT OF MY-OT ON BALANCE, BALANCE SELF-EFFICACY, AND FALL RISK FACTOR MANAGEMENT IN PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC STROKE. SETTING: UNIVERSITY RESEARCH LABORATORY. PARTICIPANTS: PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC STROKE WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY IF THEY: HAD SUSTAINED A FALL OR HAD FEAR OF FALLING, WERE ABLE TO STAND, AND HAND IMPAIRED BALANCE AND WERE AT RISK FOR FALLS (</=46 ON THE BERG BALANCE SCALE (BBS)). INTERVENTIONS: INDIVIDUALS COMPLETED AN 8 WEEK INTERVENTION THAT INCLUDED 16 SESSIONS OF BOTH YOGA AND GROUP OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY (OT). YOGA INCLUDED PHYSICAL POSTURES, BREATHING EXERCISES, AND MEDITATION. OT FOCUSED ON POST-STROKE FALL RISK FACTOR MANAGEMENT. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: THE BBS WAS USED TO ASSESS BALANCE, THE ACTIVITIES-SPECIFIC BALANCE CONFIDENCE SCALE (ABC) WAS USED TO MEASURE BALANCE SELF-EFFICACY. FIVE FALL RISK FACTOR MANAGEMENT SCALES WERE USED. RESULTS: OVERALL, THE INTERVENTION WAS CONSIDERED FEASIBLE, AS INDIVIDUALS WERE ABLE TO SAFELY COMPLETE THE INTERVENTION WITH LITTLE ATTRITION AND HIGH ATTENDANCE. BALANCE IMPROVED BY 30% (P=0.002). BALANCE SELF-EFFICACY IMPROVED BY 15% (P=0.034). EACH OF THE FIVE FALL RISK FACTOR MANAGEMENT SCALES IMPROVED, BUT ONLY TWO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED (FALL PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT QUESTIONNAIRE, 29%, P=0.004 AND FALL PREVENTION STRATEGY SURVEY, 42%, P=0.032). CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT MY-OT IS A POTENTIAL INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE MULTIPLE FALL RELATED OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE WITH STROKE. THERAPISTS MAY CONSIDER THESE INTERVENTIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH STROKE, BUT ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS WARRANTED.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
14 1314  26 HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES AFTER THE MERGING YOGA AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE PROGRAM: A MIXED-METHODS STUDY. BACKGROUND: TO UNDERSTAND CHANGES IN HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) AFTER THE MERGING YOGA AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE (MY-OT FOR PD) PROGRAM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE USED A MIXED-METHODS CONVERGENT DESIGN AND ADMINISTERED THE PARKINSON'S DISEASE QUESTIONNAIRE-8 (PDQ-8), A MEASURE OF HRQOL, WITH 17 PARTICIPANTS. WE CONSIDERED SCORES 8 WEEKS BEFORE MY-OT FOR PD, JUST BEFORE, AND UPON COMPLETION. ADDITIONALLY, WE COMPLETED TWO FOCUS GROUPS FOLLOWING THE PROGRAM WITH 16 PARTICIPANTS TO ASSESS QUALITATIVE CHANGES IN HRQOL. RESULTS: THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN PDQ-8 SCORES BETWEEN TIME POINTS, F(2,32) = 1.60, P = 0.22, PARTIAL ETA(2) = 0.09. PARTICIPANTS DID DISCUSS IMPROVEMENTS IN ALL 8 HRQOL DOMAINS, FREQUENTLY REGARDING MOBILITY AND ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING. CONCLUSION: RESULTS DIVERGED, WITH QUANTITATIVE RESULTS SHOWING NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN HRQOL AND QUALITATIVE RESULTS INDICATING PARTICIPANT PERCEIVED IMPROVEMENTS IN ALL DOMAINS OF THE PDQ-8. THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE EXPLORED FURTHER, AND LONGITUDINAL FOLLOW-UP COMPLETED.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
15 1161  32 EVALUATING A GROUP-BASED YOGA OF STRESS RESILIENCE PROGRAMME: A PRAGMATIC BEFORE-AFTER INTERVENTIONAL STUDY PROTOCOL. INTRODUCTION: RATES OF MENTAL HEALTH ILLNESSES AND BURNOUT ARE INCREASING INTERNATIONALLY. THERAPEUTIC YOGA IS INCREASINGLY USED TO IMPROVE AND MAINTAIN PHYSICAL, MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING AND GENERAL HEALTH. THIS PROTOCOL DESCRIBES A STUDY TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AN EXISTING PRIMARY CARE GROUP-BASED THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAMME, THE YOGA OF STRESS RESILIENCE PROGRAMME, WHICH COMBINES YOGA AND PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC TECHNIQUES, IN IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH AND DECREASING BURNOUT. IMPLEMENTATION FACTORS WILL ALSO BE EVALUATED FOR POTENTIAL SCALE-UP. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A PRAGMATIC BEFORE-AFTER INTERVENTIONAL TRIAL DESIGN WILL BE USED TO STUDY CHANGES IN OCCUPATIONAL PARTICIPATION AND MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES, INCLUDING ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, BURNOUT, FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT, INSOMNIA, PERCEIVED STRESS, LONELINESS, SELF-COMPASSION AND READINESS FOR CHANGE IN ADULTS EXPERIENCING ANXIETY AND BURNOUT. REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE CHANGES IN OUTCOME MEASURES OVER TIME. REGRESSION AND MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES WILL BE CONDUCTED TO EXAMINE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PARTICIPANT CHARACTERISTICS AND OUTCOMES AND AMONG VARIOUS OUTCOMES.

16 1174  52 EVALUATION OF A YOGA-BASED MIND-BODY INTERVENTION FOR RESIDENT PHYSICIANS: A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS (MBIS) HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL INTERVENTIONS FOR MITIGATING PHYSICIAN BURNOUT, BUT THERE ARE NO CONTROLLED STUDIES OF YOGA-BASED MBIS IN RESIDENT PHYSICIANS. WE ASSESSED THE FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA-BASED MBI CALLED RISE (RESILIENCE, INTEGRATION, SELF-AWARENESS, ENGAGEMENT) FOR RESIDENTS AMONG MULTIPLE SPECIALTIES AND ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A WAITLIST CONTROLLED RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL OF THE RISE PROGRAM WITH RESIDENTS FROM MULTIPLE SPECIALTY DEPARTMENTS AT THREE ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS. THE RISE PROGRAM CONSISTED OF SIX WEEKLY SESSIONS WITH SUGGESTED HOME PRACTICE. FEASIBILITY WAS ASSESSED ACROSS SIX DOMAINS: DEMAND, IMPLEMENTATION, PRACTICALITY, ACCEPTABILITY, ADAPTATION, AND INTEGRATION. SELF-REPORTED MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE, POST-PROGRAM, AND TWO-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: AMONG 2,000 RESIDENTS CONTACTED, 75 WERE ASSESSED FOR ELIGIBILITY AND 56 WERE ENROLLED. FORTY-FOUR PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE STUDY AND WERE INCLUDED IN ANALYSIS. ON AVERAGE, PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED TWO OF SIX SESSIONS. FEASIBILITY OF IN-PERSON ATTENDANCE WAS RATED AS 28.9 (SD 25.6) ON A 100-POINT VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE. PARTICIPANTS RATED FEASIBILITY AS 69.2 (SD 26.0) IF THE PROGRAM WAS OFFERED VIRTUALLY. THOSE WHO RECEIVED RISE REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN MINDFULNESS, STRESS, BURNOUT, AND PHYSICIAN WELL-BEING FROM BASELINE TO POST-PROGRAM, WHICH WERE SUSTAINED AT TWO-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. CONCLUSION: THIS IS THE FIRST CONTROLLED STUDY OF A YOGA-BASED MBI IN RESIDENTS. WHILE THE PROGRAM WAS NOT FEASIBLE AS DELIVERED IN THIS PILOT STUDY, INITIAL ANALYSES SHOWED IMPROVEMENT IN MULTIPLE MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH. RESIDENTS REPORTED THAT VIRTUAL DELIVERY WOULD INCREASE FEASIBILITY.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
17 1921  30 ROLE OF YOGA AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN WORK-RELATED MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS AMONG DENTISTS. BACKGROUND: WORK-RELATED MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN IS ONE OF THE OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS IN DENTISTS. AIMS: TO FIND THE PREVALENCE AND SEVERITY OF MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN IN DENTISTS, TO COMPARE MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN AMONG DENTISTS PRACTICING YOGA, THOSE PRACTICING PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES, AND THOSE WITHOUT ANY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND ALSO TO KNOW THE EFFECTS OF SEX, AGE, AND WORKLOAD ON MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A SELF-REPORTING WORK-RELATED QUESTIONNAIRE AND THE NORDIC QUESTIONNAIRE FOR ANALYSIS OF MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS WERE GIVEN TO GRADUATED DENTISTS ATTENDING INDIAN DENTAL CONFERENCE IN MUMBAI, TO KNOW THE MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN EXPERIENCED IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS AND FEEDBACK WAS OBTAINED FROM 220 DENTISTS. RESULTS: THE PREVALENCE OF MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN IN DENTISTS WAS 34.5%. PREVALENCE OF MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN WAS 10.5%, 21.7%, AND 45.6% IN DENTISTS WITH REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE, OTHER PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND NO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, RESPECTIVELY. THERE WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE PREVALENCE OF MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN AMONG DENTISTS WHO WERE PRACTICING YOGA WHEN COMPARED WITH THOSE IN NO REGULAR ACTIVITY GROUP. CONCLUSION: WITHIN THE LIMITATIONS OF THE STUDY, THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT ROLE OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ON THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF WORK-RELATED MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS EXPERIENCED BY DENTISTS. YOGA WAS FOUND TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN OTHER MODES OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES. MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED ON MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS IN DENTISTS, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON LARGER SAMPLE SIZES AND CORRELATING OTHER FACTORS LIKE AGE AND SEX OF THE DENTISTS, DURATION OF PRACTICE, YEARS OF PRACTICING YOGA, AND WORKING HOURS PER WEEK.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
18 1956  22 SELF-CARE AND YOGA-ACADEMIC-PRACTICE COLLABORATION FOR OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH.

19 1179  38 EVALUATION OF THE BENEFITS OF A KRIPALU YOGA PROGRAM FOR POLICE ACADEMY TRAINEES: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: LAW ENFORCEMENT RANKS AS ONE OF THE MOST STRESSFUL OCCUPATIONS IN THE WORLD. YOGA IS A MIND-BODY PRACTICE COMPOSED OF POSTURES, BREATHING, AND MEDITATION TECHNIQUES, AND IS KNOWN FOR ITS BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON STRESS AND MOOD DISTURBANCE. OBJECTIVES: THIS PILOT STUDY EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF KRIPALU YOGA ON PERCEIVED STRESS, MOOD, AND MINDFULNESS DURING POLICE ACADEMY TRAINING. METHOD: FORTY-TWO RECRUITS PARTICIPATED IN A 6-CLASS YOGA INTERVENTION. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE PROFILE OF MOOD STATES-SHORT FORM, PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE, AND THE FIVE FACET MINDFULNESS QUESTIONNAIRE PRIOR TO AND IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF THE YOGA PROGRAM, AS WELL AS AN EXIT SURVEY. RESULTS: PAIRED SAMPLES T-TESTS REVEALED SIGNIFICANT POSTINTERVENTION CHANGES IN PERCEIVED STRESS AND MOOD, REDUCTIONS IN TENSION AND FATIGUE, AND A TREND TOWARD REDUCED ANGER. CHANGES IN MINDFULNESS WERE NOT DETECTED. THE EXIT SURVEY INDICATED PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR SOME PARTICIPANTS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY SUGGESTS THAT YOGA MAY BE BENEFICIAL FOR REDUCING STRESS, TENSION, AND FATIGUE AMONG POLICE ACADEMY TRAINEES. FUTURE LONGITUDINAL RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS ARE NEEDED TO EVALUATE ITS FULL POTENTIAL AS A PERMANENT COMPONENT OF POLICE ACADEMY TRAINING.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
20 1832  40 PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING, HEALTH BEHAVIORS, AND WEIGHT LOSS AMONG PARTICIPANTS IN A RESIDENTIAL, KRIPALU YOGA-BASED WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM. UNLABELLED: THE INCREASING PREVALENCE OF OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY IN HUMANS IS A GROWING PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN IN THE UNITED STATES. CONCOMITANTS INCLUDE POOR HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND REDUCED PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING. PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE SUGGESTS YOGA AND TREATMENT PARADIGMS INCORPORATING MINDFULNESS, SELF-COMPASSION (SC), ACCEPTANCE, NON-DIETING, AND INTUITIVE EATING MAY IMPROVE THESE ANCILLARY CORRELATES, WHICH MAY PROMOTE LONG-TERM WEIGHT LOSS. METHODS: WE EXPLORED THE IMPACT OF A 5-DAY RESIDENTIAL WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM, WHICH WAS MULTIFACETED AND BASED ON KRIPALU YOGA, ON HEALTH BEHAVIORS, WEIGHT LOSS, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING IN OVERWEIGHT/OBESE INDIVIDUALS. THIRTY-SEVEN OVERWEIGHT/OBESE PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS (AGE 32-65, BMI<25) COMPLETED VALIDATED MIND-FULNESS, SC, LIFESTYLE BEHAVIOR, AND MOOD QUESTIONNAIRES AT BASELINE, POST-PROGRAM, AND 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP AND REPORTED THEIR WEIGHT 1 YEAR AFTER PROGRAM COMPLETION. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN NUTRITION BEHAVIORS, SC, MINDFULNESS, STRESS MANAGEMENT, AND SPIRITUAL GROWTH WERE OBSERVED IMMEDIATELY POST-PROGRAM (N = 31, 84% RETENTION), WITH MEDIUM TO LARGE EFFECT SIZES. AT 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP (N = 18, 49% RETENTION), MOST CHANGES PERSISTED. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND MOOD DISTURBANCE HAD IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY POST-PROGRAM BUT FAILED TO REACH SIGNIFICANCE AT 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. SELF-REPORT WEIGHT LOSS AT 1 YEAR (N = 19, 51% RETENTION) WAS SIGNIFICANT. CONCLUSION: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST A KRIPALU YOGA-BASED, RESIDENTIAL WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM MAY FOSTER PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING, IMPROVED NUTRITION BEHAVIORS, AND WEIGHT LOSS. GIVEN THE EXPLORATORY NATURE OF THIS INVESTIGATION, MORE RIGOROUS WORK IN THIS AREA IS WARRANTED.	2012

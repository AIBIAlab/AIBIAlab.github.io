1 2731 143 YOGA OFFERS CARDIOVASCULAR PROTECTION IN EARLY POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. CONTEXT: POSTMENOPAUSE, AN ESTROGEN DEFICIENT STATE COMES WITH INCREASED INCIDENCE OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES (CVDS). YOGA HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS HAVING A BENEFICIAL EFFECT ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV), A MARKER FOR CARDIAC AUTONOMIC ACTIVITY WHICH CAN ASSESS CARDIOVASCULAR RISK, IN VARIOUS POPULATIONS. AIM: THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF 3-MONTH LONG YOGA PRACTICE ON HRV IN EARLY POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A PROSPECTIVE LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF 67 WOMEN WITHIN 5 YEARS OF MENOPAUSE BETWEEN 45 AND 60 YEARS OF AGE ATTENDING MENOPAUSE CLINIC OF DEPARTMENT OF GYNAECOLOGY, SUCHETA KRIPLANI HOSPITAL FULFILLING INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA AND CONSENTING WERE ENROLLED FOR THE STUDY. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: HRV OF 37 CASES (YOGA GROUP) AND 30 CONTROLS (NON-YOGA GROUP) WAS RECORDED PRE AND 3-MONTH POSTINTERVENTION. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: GRAPHPAD PRISM VERSION 5 SOFTWARE WAS USED. VALUES ARE A MEAN AND STANDARD ERROR OF MEAN. STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE WAS SET UP AT P < 0.05. RESULTS: IN HRV, FREQUENCY DOMAIN ANALYSIS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT FALL IN LOW FREQUENCY (LF) IN NORMALIZED UNITS (NU) AND LF: HIGH FREQUENCY (HF) RATIO AND SIGNIFICANT RISE IN HF IN NU IN THE YOGA GROUP (DEPICTING PARASYMPATHETIC DOMINANCE) AGAINST A SIGNIFICANT RISE IN LF (NU) AND LF: HF RATIO AND SIGNIFICANT FALL IN HF (NU) IN NON-YOGA GROUP (INDICATING SYMPATHETIC DOMINANCE). TIME DOMAIN ANALYSIS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN STANDARD DEVIATION OF NN INTERVALS IN NON-YOGA GROUP AGAINST NONSIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN YOGA GROUP INDICATING DETERIORATION IN PARASYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY IN NON-YOGA GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: THREE-MONTH LONG YOGA PRACTICE IMPROVED HRV IN EARLY POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN SIGNIFICANTLY AND HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ATTENUATE THE CVD RISK IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
2 1578  59 MEASUREMENT OF THE EFFECT OF ISHA YOGA ON CARDIAC AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM USING SHORT-TERM HEART RATE VARIABILITY. BACKGROUND: BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA HAVE BEEN POSTULATED TO BE DUE TO MODULATION OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM. OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF ISHA YOGA PRACTICES ON CARDIOVASCULAR AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM THROUGH SHORT-TERM HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV). DESIGN OF THE STUDY: SHORT-TERM HRV OF LONG-TERM REGULAR HEALTHY 14 (12 MALES AND 2 FEMALES) ISHA YOGA PRACTITIONERS WAS COMPARED WITH THAT OF AGE- AND GENDER-MATCHED 14 (12 MALES AND 2 FEMALES) NON-YOGA PRACTITIONERS. METHODS AND MATERIALS: ECG LEAD II AND RESPIRATORY MOVEMENTS WERE RECORDED IN BOTH GROUPS USING POLYRITE DURING SUPINE REST FOR 5 MIN AND CONTROLLED DEEP BREATHING FOR 1 MINUTE. FREQUENCY DOMAIN ANALYSIS [RR INTERVAL IS THE MEAN OF DISTANCE BETWEEN SUBSEQUENT R WAVE PEAKS IN ECG], LOW FREQUENCY (LF) POWER, HIGH FREQUENCY (HF) POWER, LF NORMALIZED UNITS (NU), HF NU, LF/HF RATIO] AND TIME DOMAIN ANALYSIS [STANDARD DEVIATION OF NORMAL TO NORMAL INTERVAL (SDNN), SQUARE OF MEAN SQUARED DIFFERENCE OF SUCCESSIVE NORMAL TO NORMAL INTERVALS (RMSSD), NORMAL TO NORMAL INTERVALS WHICH ARE DIFFERING BY 50 MS (NN50), AND PERCENTAGE OF NN50 (PNN50)] OF HRV VARIABLES WERE ANALYZED FOR SUPINE REST. TIME DOMAIN ANALYSIS WAS RECORDED FOR DEEP BREATHING. RESULTS: RESULTS SHOWED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ISHA YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND CONTROLS IN BOTH FREQUENCY AND TIME DOMAIN ANALYSES OF HRV INDICES, WITH NO DIFFERENCE IN RESTING HEART RATE BETWEEN THE GROUPS. CONCLUSIONS: PRACTITIONERS OF ISHA YOGA SHOWED WELL-BALANCED BENEFICIAL ACTIVITY OF VAGAL EFFERENTS, AN OVERALL INCREASED HRV, AND SYMPATHOVAGAL BALANCE, COMPARED TO NON-YOGA PRACTITIONERS DURING SUPINE REST AND DEEP BREATHING.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
3  297  44 ALTERNATE NOSTRIL BREATHING AT DIFFERENT RATES AND ITS INFLUENCE ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY IN NON PRACTITIONERS OF YOGA. INTRODUCTION: HEART RATE VARIABILITY IS A MEASURE OF MODULATION IN AUTONOMIC INPUT TO THE HEART AND IS ONE OF THE MARKERS OF AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS. THOUGH THERE ARE MANY STUDIES ON THE LONG TERM INFLUENCE OF BREATHING ON HRV (HEART RATE VARIABILITY) THERE ARE ONLY A FEW STUDIES ON THE IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF BREATHING ESPECIALLY ALTERNATE NOSTRIL BREATHING ON HRV. THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON THE IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF ALTERNATE NOSTRIL BREATHING AND THE INFLUENCE OF DIFFERENT BREATHING RATES ON HRV. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE STUDY WAS DONE ON 25 SUBJECTS IN THE AGE GROUP OF 17-35 YEARS. ECG AND RESPIRATION WERE RECORDED BEFORE INTERVENTION AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE SUBJECTS WERE ASKED TO PERFORM ALTERNATE NOSTRIL BREATHING FOR FIVE MINUTES. RESULTS: LOW FREQUENCY (LF) WHICH IS A MARKER OF SYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY INCREASED, HIGH FREQUENCY (HF) WHICH IS A MARKER OF PARASYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY DECREASED AND THEIR RATIO LF/HF WHICH IS A MARKER OF SYMPATHO/VAGAL BALANCE INCREASED IMMEDIATELY AFTER 6 AND 12 MINUTES IN COMPARISON TO BASELINE VALUES WHEREAS THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE MEANS OF THESE COMPONENTS WHEN BOTH 6 AND 12 MINUTES WERE COMPARED. CONCLUSION: IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF ALTERNATE NOSTRIL BREATHING ON HRV IN NON PRACTITIONERS OF YOGIC BREATHING ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE LONG TERM INFLUENCE OF YOGIC BREATHING ON HRV WHICH SHOW A PREDOMINANT PARASYMPATHETIC INFLUENCE ON THE HEART.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
4  452  43 CHANGES IN HEART RATE VARIABILITY AFTER YOGA ARE DEPENDENT ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY AT BASELINE AND DURING YOGA: A STUDY SHOWING AUTONOMIC NORMALIZATION EFFECT IN YOGA-NAIVE AND EXPERIENCED SUBJECTS. BACKGROUND: YOGA THERAPY IS WIDELY APPLIED TO THE MAINTENANCE OF HEALTH AND TO TREATMENT OF VARIOUS ILLNESSES. PREVIOUS RESEARCHES INDICATE THE INVOLVEMENT OF AUTONOMIC CONTROL IN ITS EFFECTS, ALTHOUGH THE GENERAL AGREEMENT HAS NOT BEEN REACHED REGARDING THE ACUTE MODULATION OF AUTONOMIC FUNCTION. AIM: THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED AT REVEALING THE ACUTE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE AUTONOMIC ACTIVITY USING HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) MEASUREMENT. METHODS: TWENTY-SEVEN HEALTHY CONTROLS PARTICIPATED IN THE PRESENT STUDY. FIFTEEN OF THEM (39.5 +/- 8.5 YEARS OLD) WERE NAIVE AND 12 (45.1 +/- 7.0 YEARS OLD) WERE EXPERIENCED IN YOGA. YOGA SKILLS INCLUDED BREATH AWARENESS, TWO TYPES OF ASANA, AND TWO TYPES OF PRANAYAMA. HRV WAS MEASURED AT THE BASELINE, DURING YOGA, AND AT THE RESTING STATE AFTER YOGA. RESULTS: IN BOTH YOGA-NAIVE AND EXPERIENCED PARTICIPANTS, THE CHANGES IN LOW-FREQUENCY (LF) COMPONENT OF HRV AND ITS RATIO TO HIGH-FREQUENCY (HF) COMPONENT (LF/HF) AFTER YOGA WERE FOUND TO BE CORRELATED NEGATIVELY WITH THE BASELINE DATA. THE CHANGES IN LF AFTER YOGA WERE ALSO CORRELATED WITH LF DURING YOGA. THE CHANGES IN HF AS WELL AS THE RAW HRV DATA AFTER YOGA WERE NOT RELATED TO THE BASELINE HRV OR THE HRV DURING YOGA. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT YOGA LEADS TO AN INCREASE IN LF WHEN LF IS LOW AND LEADS TO A DECREASE IN LF WHEN IT IS HIGH AT THE BASELINE. THIS NORMALIZATION OF LF IS DEPENDENT ON THE AUTONOMIC MODULATION DURING YOGA AND MAY UNDERLIE THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA THERAPY BOTH IN YOGA-NAIVE AND EXPERIENCED SUBJECTS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
5  243  34 A YOGA & EXERCISE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL FOR VASOMOTOR SYMPTOMS: EFFECTS ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY. OBJECTIVES: HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) REFLECTS THE INTEGRATION OF THE PARASYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM WITH THE REST OF THE BODY. STUDIES ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND EXERCISE ON HRV HAVE BEEN MIXED BUT SUGGEST THAT EXERCISE INCREASES HRV. WE CONDUCTED A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECT OF YOGA AND EXERCISE ON HRV BASED ON A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL OF TREATMENTS FOR VASOMOTOR SYMPTOMS IN PERI/POST-MENOPAUSAL WOMEN. DESIGN: RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL OF BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS IN WOMEN WITH VASOMOTOR SYMPTOMS (N=335), 40-62 YEARS OLD FROM THREE CLINICAL STUDY SITES. INTERVENTIONS: 12-WEEKS OF A YOGA PROGRAM, DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR MID-LIFE WOMEN, OR A SUPERVISED AEROBIC EXERCISE-TRAINING PROGRAM WITH SPECIFIC INTENSITY AND ENERGY EXPENDITURE GOALS, COMPARED TO A USUAL ACTIVITY GROUP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: TIME AND FREQUENCY DOMAIN HRV MEASURED AT BASELINE AND AT 12 WEEKS FOR 15MIN USING HOLTER MONITORS. RESULTS: WOMEN HAD A MEDIAN OF 7.6 VASOMOTOR SYMPTOMS PER 24H. TIME AND FREQUENCY DOMAIN HRV MEASURES DID NOT CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY IN EITHER OF THE INTERVENTION GROUPS COMPARED TO THE CHANGE IN THE USUAL ACTIVITY GROUP. HRV RESULTS DID NOT DIFFER WHEN THE ANALYSES WERE RESTRICTED TO POST-MENOPAUSAL WOMEN. CONCLUSIONS: ALTHOUGH YOGA AND EXERCISE HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE PARASYMPATHETIC-MEDIATED HRV IN OTHER POPULATIONS, NEITHER INTERVENTION INCREASED HRV IN MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN WITH VASOMOTOR SYMPTOMS. MIXED RESULTS IN PREVIOUS RESEARCH MAY BE DUE TO SAMPLE DIFFERENCES. YOGA AND EXERCISE LIKELY IMPROVE SHORT-TERM HEALTH IN MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN THROUGH MECHANISMS OTHER THAN HRV.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
6  350  59 ASSESSMENT OF CARDIAC AUTONOMIC TONE FOLLOWING LONG SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA IN ART OF LIVING PRACTITIONERS. OBJECTIVE: THE BREATHING PROCESSES ARE KNOWN TO MODULATE CARDIAC AUTONOMIC TONE AND IMPROVE PSYCHOLOGICAL STATUS. WE INVESTIGATED CARDIAC AUTONOMIC TONE FOLLOWING LONG SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA (SKY) USING HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) AND SKIN CONDUCTANCE LEVEL (SCL). METHODS: THIRTY HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS (AGE 28.3 +/- 8.4 YEARS; 23 M: 7 F) PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY. ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG) AND SCL WERE RECORDED FOR 5 MIN EACH, BEFORE AND AFTER LONG SKY. LONG SKY IS A COMBINATION OF PRANAYAMA AND CYCLIC RHYTHMIC BREATHING AND IS PERFORMED BY FOLLOWING THE GUIDED AUDIO INSTRUCTIONS. HRV ANALYSIS WAS USED FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF CARDIAC AUTONOMIC TONE. TIME AND FREQUENCY DOMAIN PARAMETERS OF HRV WERE CALCULATED BY USING RR INTERVAL OF ECG. SCL WAS ACQUIRED USING GALVANIC SKIN RESPONSE (GSR) AMPLIFIER OF POWERLAB IN MICROSEIMENS (MUS). RESULTS: TIME DOMAIN PARAMETERS OF HRV, INCLUDING MEAN RR INTERVAL (P = 0.000), RESPIRATORY SINUS ARRHYTHMIA (RSA) (P = 0.037), STANDARD DEVIATION OF ALL NN INTERVALS (SDNN) (P = 0.013), NN50 COUNT DIVIDED BY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ALL NN INTERVALS (PNN50) (P = 0.004), AND SQUARE ROOT OF THE MEAN OF THE SUM OF THE SQUARES OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ADJACENT NN INTERVALS (RMSSD) (P = 0.002) INCREASED, AND MEAN HEART RATE DECREASED (P = 0.000) FOLLOWING LONG SKY. IN FREQUENCY DOMAIN ANALYSIS, POWER OF LOW-FREQUENCY (LF) COMPONENT (P = 0.010) AND LF/HF RATIO (P = 0.008) DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY, WHEREAS POWER OF HIGH FREQUENCY (HF) SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED (P = 0.010). SCL DECREASED FOLLOWING LONG SKY, ALTHOUGH IT DID NOT ATTAIN STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT LONG SKY INDUCES SIGNIFICANT OSCILLATIONS IN CARDIAC AUTONOMIC TONE. PARASYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY INCREASES AND SYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY DECREASES AND SYMPATHOVAGAL BALANCE IMPROVES FOLLOWING LONG SKY. DECREASE IN SYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY IS ALSO DEMONSTRATED BY DECREASE IN CONDUCTANCE ALTHOUGH IT DID NOT REACH STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. FROM THIS STUDY IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT LONG SKY HAS A BENEFICIAL EFFECT ON CARDIAC AUTONOMIC TONE, AND PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL RELAXATION. IT MAY SERVE AS A TOOL TO IMPROVE HRV, WHICH IS THE MARKER OF CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                              
7 1558  47 LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY IN HEALTHY PRACTITIONERS: POTENTIAL BENEFITS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR RISK REDUCTION. HATHA YOGA IS COMMONLY PRACTICED IN WESTERN COUNTRIES AND IS CLAIMED TO REDUCE RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE AND COMPARE TIME-DOMAIN AND FREQUENCY-DOMAIN METRICS OF HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) IN HATHA YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND HEALTHY CONTROLS. THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY, WHICH WAS CONDUCTED AT A REGIONAL UNIVERSITY AND COMMUNITY WELLNESS CENTER, INCLUDED CONVENIENCE SAMPLING OF 19 HATHA YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND 8 HEALTHY CONTROLS. USING A LEAD II ECG SYSTEM, 10 MINUTES OF ELECTROCARDIOGRAM (ECG) RECORDING WAS COLLECTED FOR EACH PARTICIPANT. ARTIFACT-FREE, 5-MINUTE SIGNALS WERE USED TO DERIVE TIME-DOMAIN AND FREQUENCY-DOMAIN MEASURES OF HRV. THE MEAN DURATION OF HATHA YOGA PRACTICE AMONG PRACTITIONERS WAS 11.47 +/- 8 YEARS. DEMOGRAPHIC AND ANTHROPOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN GROUPS. COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP, THE YOGA GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER MEAN HIGH FREQUENCY (HF) POWER (859.2 +/- 1342.1 VS 175.5 +/- 121.1; P = .04) AND MEAN HF NORMALIZED UNITS (NU) (57.0 +/- 16.6 VS 36.7 +/- 13.4; P = .02) AND A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER LOW FREQUENCY (LF)/HF RATIO (1.1 +/- 0.5 VS 2.2 +/- 1.1; P = .01). NO SIGNIFICANT INTERGROUP DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED FOR LF POWER, LF NU, OR ANY TIME-DOMAIN MEASURES OF HRV. THESE RESULTS LACK GENERALIZABILITY DUE TO SMALL SAMPLE SIZE AND LACK OF BLINDED ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME MEASURES. HATHA YOGA PRACTITIONERS SHOWED PARASYMPATHETIC PREDOMINANCE COMPARED WITH HEALTHY CONTROLS. ANALYZING FREQUENCY-DOMAIN HRV METRICS ENABLES DETECTING CHANGES IN CARDIAC AUTONOMIC FUNCTION EARLIER THAN BY ANALYSIS OF TIME-DOMAIN METRICS. PARASYMPATHETIC PREDOMINANCE DEMONSTRATED IN THE YOGA GROUP SUGGESTS HATHA YOGA PRACTITIONERS MAY BE AT LOWER RISK FOR STRESS-RELATED COMORBIDITIES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
8 1318  50 HEART RATE VARIABILITY IN CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN PATIENTS RANDOMIZED TO YOGA OR STANDARD CARE. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC PAIN CAN ALTER THE AUTONOMIC BALANCE WITH INCREASED SYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY REFLECTED IN ALTERED HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV). IT HAS BEEN PROPOSED THAT YOGA CAN BE USEFUL TO CORRECT THE AUTONOMIC IMBALANCE IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC PAIN WHO HAVE REDUCED HRV. METHODS AND DESIGNS: IN THE PRESENT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL 62 PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN ASSOCIATED WITH ALTERED ALIGNMENT OF INTERVERTEBRAL DISCS (AGED BETWEEN 20 AND 45 YEARS, 32 MALES) WERE RANDOMIZED TO 2 GROUPS. ONE GROUP RECEIVED YOGA FOR 3 MONTHS WHILE THE OTHER GROUP CARRIED OUT STANDARD MEDICAL CARE BASED ON THE PHYSICIAN'S ADVICE. THE DURATION WAS THE SAME, I.E., 3 MONTHS. THE HEART RATE VARIABILITY AND RATE OF RESPIRATION WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND AT THE END OF 3 MONTHS. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE BASELINE (PRE) VALUES BETWEEN GROUPS (P = 0.008) FOR RESPIRATION RATE WHICH WAS HIGHER IN THE YOGA GROUP. THE CHANGES REPORTED BELOW ARE PRE-POST COMPARISONS WITHIN EACH GROUP. THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.05; REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA, POST-HOC ANALYSES) DECREASE IN THE LF POWER OF HRV, RATE OF RESPIRATION AND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE HF POWER OF HRV AND IN THE PNN50. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA PRACTICE CAN SHIFT THE AUTONOMIC BALANCE TOWARDS VAGAL DOMINANCE IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN ASSOCIATED WITH ALTERED ALIGNMENT OF INTERVERTEBRAL DISCS. TRIAL REGISTRATION: THE STUDY IS REGISTERED WITH THE CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRY OF INDIA ( CTRI/2012/11/003094 ) AND CAN BE ACCESSED AT.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
9 1317  43 HEART RATE VARIABILITY CHANGES DURING HIGH FREQUENCY YOGA BREATHING AND BREATH AWARENESS. BACKGROUND: PRE AND POST COMPARISON AFTER ONE MINUTE OF HIGH FREQUENCY YOGA BREATHING (HFYB) SUGGESTED THAT THE HFYB MODIFIES THE AUTONOMIC STATUS BY INCREASING SYMPATHETIC MODULATION, BUT ITS EFFECT DURING THE PRACTICE WAS NOT ASSESSED. METHODS: THIRTY-EIGHT MALE VOLUNTEERS WITH GROUP AVERAGE AGE +/- S.D., 23.3 +/- 4.4 YEARS WERE EACH ASSESSED ON TWO SEPARATE DAYS IN TWO SESSIONS, (I) HFYB AND (II) BREATH AWARENESS. EACH SESSION WAS FOR 35 MINUTES, WITH 3 PERIODS, I.E., PRE (5 MINUTES), DURING HFYB OR BREATH AWARENESS (15 MINUTES) AND POST (5 MINUTES). RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN NN50, PNN50 AND THE MEAN RR INTERVAL DURING AND AFTER HFYB AND AFTER BREATH AWARENESS, COMPARED TO THE RESPECTIVE 'PRE' VALUES (P < 0.05) (REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA FOLLOWED BY POST-HOC ANALYSIS). THE LF POWER INCREASED AND HF POWER DECREASED DURING AND AFTER BREATH AWARENESS AND LF/HF RATIO INCREASED AFTER BREATH AWARENESS (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THERE WAS REDUCED PARASYMPATHETIC MODULATION DURING AND AFTER HFYB AND INCREASED SYMPATHETIC MODULATION WITH REDUCED PARASYMPATHETIC MODULATION DURING AND AFTER BREATH AWARENESS.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
10 2680  44 YOGA IN SCHOOL SPORTS IMPROVES FUNCTIONING OF AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM IN YOUNG ADULTS: A NON-RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: YOGA IN SCHOOL IS A BENEFICIAL TOOL TO PROMOTE THE GOOD HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF STUDENTS BY CHANGING THE WAY THEY REACT TO STRESS. THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA-TAUGHT IN SCHOOLS-ON CHILDREN, YOUTH AND YOUNG ADULTS HAVE BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN FORMER STUDIES USING MOSTLY SUBJECTIVE PSYCHOMETRIC DATA. AIM: THE PRESENT TRIAL AIMS TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA ON AUTONOMIC REGULATION IN YOUNG ADULTS BY ANALYZING HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV). METHODS: THIS STUDY IS A NON-RANDOMIZED, EXPLORATIVE, TWO-ARM-PILOT STUDY WITH AN ACTIVE CONTROL GROUP. FOURTEEN HEALTHY YOUNG ADULTS TOOK PART IN A 10-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM (90 MIN ONCE A WEEK) IN SCHOOL AND WERE COMPARED TO A CONTROL GROUP OF 11 STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN CONVENTIONAL SCHOOL SPORTS (90 MIN ONCE A WEEK OVER 10 WEEKS). 24-HOUR ELECTROCARDIOGRAMS (ECGS) WERE RECORDED AT BASELINE AND FOLLOWING THE 10-WEEK INTERVENTION. FROM 20-MINUTE OF NOCTURNAL SLEEP PHASES, HRV PARAMETERS WERE CALCULATED FROM LINEAR (TIME AND FREQUENCY DOMAIN) AND NONLINEAR DYNAMICS (SUCH AS SYMBOLIC DYNAMICS AND POINCARE PLOT ANALYSIS). ANALYSES OF VARIANCE (ANOVA) FOLLOWED BY T-TESTS AS POST-HOC TESTS ESTIMATING BOTH STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE AND EFFECT SIZE WERE USED TO COMPARE PRE-POST-INTERVENTION FOR THE TWO GROUPS. RESULTS: THE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE INTERACTION EFFECTS DID NOT REVEAL A SIGNIFICANT GROUP AND TIME INTERACTION FOR THE INDIVIDUAL NOCTURNAL HRV INDICES. ALMOST ALL INDICES REVEALED MEDIUM AND LARGE EFFECTS REGARDING THE TIME MAIN EFFECTS. THE CHANGES IN THE HRV INDICES FOLLOWING THE INTERVENTION WERE MORE DRAMATIC FOR THE YOGA GROUP THAN FOR THE CONTROL GROUP WHICH IS REFLECTED IN PREDOMINANTLY HIGHER SIGNIFICANCES AND STRONGER EFFECT SIZES IN THE YOGA GROUP. CONCLUSION: IN THIS EXPLORATIVE PILOT TRIAL, AN INCREASE OF HRV (MORE PARASYMPATHETIC DOMINANCE AND OVERALL HIGHER HRV) AFTER TEN WEEKS OF YOGA IN SCHOOL IN COMPARISON TO REGULAR SCHOOL SPORTS WAS DEMONSTRATED, SHOWING AN IMPROVED SELF-REGULATION OF THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
11 2054  30 THE ASSOCIATION OF SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA FREQUENCY WITH SLEEP QUALITY: A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY FROM SINGAPORE. PURPOSE: THERE IS A DEARTH OF EVIDENCE FOR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOGIC BREATHING AND SLEEP QUALITY. EVEN LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT PRACTICE FREQUENCY AND BENEFIT. WE INVESTIGATED THE ASSOCIATION OF SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA FREQUENCY WITH SLEEP QUALITY AMONGST ADULT PRACTITIONERS. METHODS: IN A CROSS-SECTIONAL INVESTIGATION ON ADULT PRACTITIONERS OF SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA IN SINGAPORE, THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI) WAS USED TO ASSESS SLEEP QUALITY. SLEEP QUALITY WAS EXAMINED ACROSS THREE CATEGORIES OF PRACTICE FREQUENCY (MONTHLY, WEEKLY, DAILY). A MULTIVARIATE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL WAS USED TO DETERMINE ASSOCIATION. RESULTS: OF 385 ADULTS (241 WOMEN), THE MEAN AGE (SD) WAS 42.5 (9.9) YEARS. IN TOTAL, 32% OF THE SAMPLE (N = 124) WAS IDENTIFIED AS HAVING POOR SQ. AFTER ADJUSTING FOR STUDY COVARIATES, INDEPENDENT ANALYSES REVEALED AN INVERSE ASSOCIATION FOR HIGHER FREQUENCY OF PRACTICE AND LOWER ODDS OF POOR SQ (OR = 0.52; 95% CI = 0.28-0.94). THE P FOR TREND WAS 0.03. CONCLUSION: THE PRACTICE OF YOGIC BREATHING MAY BENEFIT SLEEP QUALITY. FURTHER EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS ARE WARRANTED.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
12  687  38 EFFECT OF AN OFFICE WORKSITE-BASED YOGA PROGRAM ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY: OUTCOMES OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC WORK-RELATED STRESS IS AN INDEPENDENT RISK FACTOR FOR CARDIOMETABOLIC DISEASES AND ASSOCIATED MORTALITY, PARTICULARLY WHEN COMPOUNDED BY A SEDENTARY WORK ENVIRONMENT. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE IF AN OFFICE WORKSITE-BASED HATHA YOGA PROGRAM COULD IMPROVE PHYSIOLOGICAL STRESS, EVALUATED VIA HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV), AND ASSOCIATED HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOMES IN A COHORT OF OFFICE WORKERS. METHODS: THIRTY-SEVEN ADULTS EMPLOYED IN UNIVERSITY-BASED OFFICE POSITIONS WERE RANDOMIZED UPON THE COMPLETION OF BASELINE TESTING TO AN EXPERIMENTAL OR CONTROL GROUP. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP COMPLETED A 10-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM PRESCRIBED THREE SESSIONS PER WEEK DURING LUNCH HOUR (50 MIN PER SESSION). AN EXPERIENCED INSTRUCTOR LED THE SESSIONS, WHICH EMPHASIZED ASANAS (POSTURES) AND VINYASA (EXERCISES). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS THE HIGH FREQUENCY (HF) POWER COMPONENT OF HRV. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED ADDITIONAL HRV PARAMETERS, MUSCULOSKELETAL FITNESS (I.E. PUSH-UP, SIDE-BRIDGE, AND SIT & REACH TESTS) AND PSYCHOLOGICAL INDICES (I.E. STATE AND TRAIT ANXIETY, QUALITY OF LIFE AND JOB SATISFACTION). RESULTS: ALL MEASURES OF HRV FAILED TO CHANGE IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP VERSUS THE CONTROL GROUP, EXCEPT THAT THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED LF:HF (P = 0.04) AND REDUCED PNN50 (P = 0.04) VERSUS CONTROL, CONTRARY TO OUR HYPOTHESES. FLEXIBILITY, EVALUATED VIA SIT & REACH TEST INCREASED IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP VERSUS THE CONTROL GROUP (P < 0.001). NO OTHER ADAPTATIONS WERE NOTED. POST HOC ANALYSIS COMPARING PARTICIPANTS WHO COMPLETED >/=70% OF YOGA SESSIONS (N = 11) TO CONTROL (N = 19) YIELDED THE SAME FINDINGS, EXCEPT THAT THE HIGH ADHERERS ALSO REDUCED STATE ANXIETY (P = 0.02) AND RMSSD (P = 0.05), AND TENDED TO IMPROVE THE PUSH-UP TEST (P = 0.07) VERSUS CONTROL. CONCLUSIONS: A 10-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION DELIVERED AT THE OFFICE WORKSITE DURING LUNCH HOUR DID NOT IMPROVE HF POWER OR OTHER HRV PARAMETERS. HOWEVER, IMPROVEMENTS IN FLEXIBILITY, STATE ANXIETY AND MUSCULOSKELETAL FITNESS WERE NOTED WITH HIGH ADHERENCE. FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS SHOULD INCORPORATE STRATEGIES TO PROMOTE ADHERENCE, INVOLVE MORE FREQUENT AND LONGER DURATIONS OF YOGA TRAINING, AND ENROL COHORTS WHO SUFFER FROM HIGHER LEVELS OF WORK-RELATED STRESS.

13 2863  31 YOGA-BASED GUIDED RELAXATION REDUCES SYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY JUDGED FROM BASELINE LEVELS. 35 MALE VOLUNTEERS WHOSE AGES RANGED FROM 20 TO 46 YEARS WERE STUDIED IN TWO SESSIONS OF YOGA-BASED GUIDED RELAXATION AND SUPINE REST. ASSESSMENTS OF AUTONOMIC VARIABLES WERE MADE FOR 15 SUBJECTS, BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER THE PRACTICES, WHEREAS OXYGEN CONSUMPTION AND BREATH VOLUME WERE RECORDED FOR 25 SUBJECTS BEFORE AND AFTER BOTH TYPES OF RELAXATION. A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN OXYGEN CONSUMPTION AND INCREASE IN BREATH VOLUME WERE RECORDED AFTER GUIDED RELAXATION (PAIRED T TEST). THERE WERE COMPARABLE REDUCTIONS IN HEART RATE AND SKIN CONDUCTANCE DURING BOTH TYPES OF RELAXATION. DURING GUIDED RELAXATION THE POWER OF THE LOW FREQUENCY COMPONENT OF THE HEART-RATE VARIABILITY SPECTRUM REDUCED, WHEREAS THE POWER OF THE HIGH FREQUENCY COMPONENT INCREASED, SUGGESTING REDUCED SYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY. ALSO, SUBJECTS WITH A BASELINE RATIO OF LF/HF > 0.5 SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE RATIO AFTER GUIDED RELAXATION, WHILE SUBJECTS WITH A RATIO < OR = 0.5 AT BASELINE SHOWED NO SUCH CHANGE. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT SYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY DECREASED AFTER GUIDED RELAXATION BASED ON YOGA, DEPENDING ON THE BASELINE LEVELS.	2002	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
14 2727  39 YOGA NIDRA RELAXATION INCREASES HEART RATE VARIABILITY AND IS UNAFFECTED BY A PRIOR BOUT OF HATHA YOGA. OBJECTIVE: THE MEASUREMENT OF HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) IS OFTEN APPLIED AS AN INDEX OF AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM (ANS) BALANCE AND, THEREFORE, MYOCARDIAL STABILITY. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SUGGESTED THAT RELAXATION OR MIND-BODY EXERCISE CAN INFLUENCE ANS BALANCE POSITIVELY AS MEASURED BY HRV BUT MAY ACT VIA DIFFERENT MECHANISMS. NO STUDIES, TO THE AUTHORS' KNOWLEDGE, HAVE EXAMINED THE ACUTE RESPONSE IN HRV TO INTERVENTIONS COMBINING RELAXATION AND MIND-BODY EXERCISE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE ACUTE HRV RESPONSES TO YOGA NIDRA RELAXATION ALONE VERSUS YOGA NIDRA RELAXATION PRECEDED BY HATHA YOGA. DESIGN: THIS WAS A RANDOMIZED COUNTER-BALANCED TRIAL. SETTING: THE TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED IN A UNIVERSITY EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY LABORATORY. SUBJECTS: SUBJECTS INCLUDED 20 WOMEN AND MEN (29.15+/-6.98 YEARS OF AGE, WITH A RANGE OF 18-47 YEARS). INTERVENTIONS: PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED A YOGA PLUS RELAXATION (YR) SESSION AND A RELAXATION ONLY (R) SESSION. RESULTS: THE YR CONDITION PRODUCED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES FROM BASELINE IN HEART RATE (HR; BEATS PER MINUTE [BPM], P<0.001) AND INDICES OF HRV: R-R (MS, P<0.001), PNN50 (%, P=0.009), LOW FREQUENCY (LF; %, P=0.008) AND HIGH FREQUENCY (HF; %, P=0.035). THE R CONDITION PRODUCED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES FROM BASELINE IN HEART RATE (BPM, P<0.001) AS WELL AS INDICES OF HRV: R-R (MS, P<0.001), HF (MS(2), P=0.004), LF (%, P=0.005), HF (%, P=0.008) AND LF:HF RATIO (%, P=0.008). THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CONDITIONS AT BASELINE NOR FOR THE CHANGES FROM BASELINE FOR ANY OF THE VARIABLES. CONCLUSIONS: THESE CHANGES DEMONSTRATE A FAVORABLE SHIFT IN AUTONOMIC BALANCE TO THE PARASYMPATHETIC BRANCH OF THE ANS FOR BOTH CONDITIONS, AND THAT YOGA NIDRA RELAXATION PRODUCES FAVORABLE CHANGES IN MEASURES OF HRV WHETHER ALONE OR PRECEDED BY A BOUT OF HATHA YOGA.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
15  448  52 CHANGES IN AUTONOMIC VARIABLES FOLLOWING TWO MEDITATIVE STATES DESCRIBED IN YOGA TEXTS. OBJECTIVES: IN ANCIENT YOGA TEXTS THERE ARE TWO MEDITATIVE STATES DESCRIBED. ONE IS DHARANA, WHICH REQUIRES FOCUSING, THE SECOND IS DHYANA, DURING WHICH THERE IS NO FOCUSING, BUT AN EXPANSIVE MENTAL STATE IS REACHED. WHILE AN EARLIER STUDY DID SHOW IMPROVED PERFORMANCE IN AN ATTENTION TASK AFTER DHARANA, THE AUTONOMIC CHANGES DURING THESE TWO STATES HAVE NOT BEEN STUDIED. METHODS: AUTONOMIC AND RESPIRATORY VARIABLES WERE ASSESSED IN 30 HEALTHY MALE VOLUNTEERS (GROUP MEAN AGE +/- SD, 29.1 +/- 5.1 YEARS) DURING FOUR MENTAL STATES DESCRIBED IN TRADITIONAL YOGA TEXTS. THESE FOUR MENTAL STATES ARE RANDOM THINKING (CANCALATA), NONMEDITATIVE FOCUSING (EKAGRATA), MEDITATIVE FOCUSING (DHARANA), AND EFFORTLESS MEDITATION (DHYANA). ASSESSMENTS WERE MADE BEFORE (5 MINUTES), DURING (20 MINUTES), AND AFTER (5 MINUTES), EACH OF THE FOUR STATES, ON FOUR SEPARATE DAYS. RESULTS: DURING DHYANA THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE SKIN RESISTANCE LEVEL (P<0.001; POST HOC ANALYSIS FOLLOWING ANOVA, DURING COMPARED TO PRE) AND PHOTO-PLETHYSMOGRAM AMPLITUDE (P<0.05), WHEREAS THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE HEART RATE (P<0.001) AND BREATH RATE (P<0.001). THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE LOW FREQUENCY (LF) POWER (P<0.001) AND INCREASE IN THE HIGH FREQUENCY (HF) POWER (P<0.001) IN THE FREQUENCY DOMAIN ANALYSIS OF THE HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) SPECTRUM, ON WHICH HF POWER IS ASSOCIATED WITH PARASYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY. THERE WAS ALSO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NN50 COUNT (THE NUMBER OF INTERVAL DIFFERENCES OF SUCCESSIVE NN INTERVALS GREATER THAN 50 MS; P<0.001) AND THE PNN50 (THE PROPORTION DERIVED BY DIVIDING NN50 BY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF NN INTERVALS; P<0.001) IN TIME DOMAIN ANALYSIS OF HRV, BOTH INDICATIVE OF PARASYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY. CONCLUSIONS: MAXIMUM CHANGES WERE SEEN IN AUTONOMIC VARIABLES AND BREATH RATE DURING THE STATE OF EFFORTLESS MEDITATION (DHYANA). THE CHANGES WERE ALL SUGGESTIVE OF REDUCED SYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY AND/OR INCREASED VAGAL MODULATION. DURING DHARANA THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN SKIN RESISTANCE. THE CHANGES IN HRV DURING EKAGRATA AND CANCALATA WERE INCONCLUSIVE.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
16  758  40 EFFECT OF SLOW BREATHING ON AUTONOMIC TONE & BAROREFLEX SENSITIVITY IN YOGA PRACTITIONERS. BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: SLOW BREATHING INCREASES PARASYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY AND BAROREFLEX SENSITIVITY (BRS) IN HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS, ALSO SIMILARLY OBSERVED IN YOGA PRACTITIONERS. PRANAYAMA WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF YOGA WHEN PRACTICED AT A SLOW PACE WAS AT A RESPIRATORY FREQUENCY OF AROUND 0.1 HZ (6 BREATHS/MIN). THEREFORE, IT WAS HYPOTHESIZED THAT YOGA PRACTITIONERS MIGHT HAVE ADAPTED TO SLOW BREATHING. THIS STUDY WAS AIMED TO DECIPHER THE ROLE OF YOGA ON CARDIOVASCULAR VARIABILITY DURING SLOW BREATHING (0.1 HZ) IN YOGA PRACTITIONERS. METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN IN NAIVE-TO-YOGA INDIVIDUALS (N=40) AND YOGA PRACTITIONERS (N=40) WITH AN AVERAGE AGE OF 31.08 +/- 7.31 AND 29.93 +/- 7.57 YR, RESPECTIVELY. THE ANALYSIS OF HEART RATE VARIABILITY, BLOOD PRESSURE VARIABILITY (BPV) AND BRS DURING SPONTANEOUS AND SLOW BREATHING WAS COMPARED BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. RESULTS: DURING SLOW BREATHING, THE HEART RATE (P<0.01) WAS LOWER, RESPIRATORY RATE INTERVAL (P<0.05) AND PNN50 PER CENT (P=0.01) WERE HIGHER, MEAN SYSTOLIC BP (SBP) (P<0.05) AND SDSD (STANDARD DEVIATION OF SUCCESSIVE BEAT TO BEAT SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE DIFFERENCES) (P<0.01) OF SBP VARIABILITY WERE LOWER WITH SEQUENCE BRS (P<0.001) AND ALPHA LOW FREQUENCY (P<0.01) AND ALPHA HIGH FREQUENCY (P<0.001) OF SPECTRAL BRS WERE HIGHER IN YOGA PRACTITIONERS. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: THE PRESENT STUDY INDICATED HIGHER PARASYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY AND BRS WITH LOWER SBP VARIABILITY AT REST AND DURING SLOW BREATHING IN YOGA PRACTITIONERS COMPARED TO NAIVE GROUP. FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE SHORT-TERM PRACTICE OF SLOW BREATHING COMPLEMENTS THE AUGMENTED PARASYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY AND BRS IN THE YOGA GROUP.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
17  686  36 EFFECT OF AN OFFICE WORKSITE-BASED YOGA PROGRAM ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC WORK-RELATED STRESS IS A SIGNIFICANT AND INDEPENDENT RISK FACTOR FOR CARDIOVASCULAR AND METABOLIC DISEASES AND ASSOCIATED MORTALITY, PARTICULARLY WHEN COMPOUNDED BY A SEDENTARY WORK ENVIRONMENT. HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) PROVIDES AN ESTIMATE OF PARASYMPATHETIC AND SYMPATHETIC AUTONOMIC CONTROL, AND CAN SERVE AS A MARKER OF PHYSIOLOGICAL STRESS. HATHA YOGA IS A PHYSICALLY DEMANDING PRACTICE THAT CAN HELP TO REDUCE STRESS; HOWEVER, TIME CONSTRAINTS INCURRED BY WORK AND FAMILY LIFE MAY LIMIT PARTICIPATION. THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT STUDY IS TO DETERMINE IF A 10-WEEK, WORKSITE-BASED YOGA PROGRAM DELIVERED DURING LUNCH HOUR CAN IMPROVE RESTING HRV AND RELATED PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS IN SEDENTARY OFFICE WORKERS. METHODS AND DESIGN: THIS IS A PARALLEL-ARM RCT THAT WILL COMPARE THE OUTCOMES OF PARTICIPANTS ASSIGNED TO THE EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT GROUP (YOGA) TO THOSE ASSIGNED TO A NO-TREATMENT CONTROL GROUP. PARTICIPANTS RANDOMIZED TO THE EXPERIMENTAL CONDITION WILL ENGAGE IN A 10-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM DELIVERED AT THEIR PLACE OF WORK. THE YOGA SESSIONS WILL BE GROUP-BASED, PRESCRIBED THREE TIMES PER WEEK DURING LUNCH HOUR, AND WILL BE LED BY AN EXPERIENCED YOGA INSTRUCTOR. THE PROGRAM WILL INVOLVE TEACHING BEGINNER STUDENTS SAFELY AND PROGRESSIVELY OVER 10 WEEKS A YOGA SEQUENCE THAT INCORPORATES ASANAS (POSES AND POSTURES), VINYASA (EXERCISES), PRANAYAMA (BREATHING CONTROL) AND MEDITATION. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME OF THIS STUDY IS THE HIGH FREQUENCY (HF) SPECTRAL POWER COMPONENT OF HRV (MEASURED IN ABSOLUTE UNITS; I.E. MS2), A MEASURE OF PARASYMPATHETIC AUTONOMIC CONTROL. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FREQUENCY AND TIME DOMAINS OF HRV, AND MEASURES OF PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH STATUS. MEASURES WILL BE COLLECTED PRIOR TO AND FOLLOWING THE INTERVENTION PERIOD, AND AT 6 MONTHS FOLLOW-UP TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF INTERVENTION WITHDRAWAL. DISCUSSION: THIS STUDY WILL DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF WORKSITE-BASED YOGA PRACTICE ON HRV AND PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH STATUS. THE FINDINGS MAY ASSIST IN IMPLEMENTING PRACTICAL INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS YOGA, INTO THE WORKPLACE TO MITIGATE STRESS, ENHANCE HEALTH STATUS AND REDUCE THE RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR AND METABOLIC DISEASES.

18  780  54 EFFECT OF YOGA AS AN ADD-ON THERAPY IN THE MODULATION OF HEART RATE VARIABILITY IN CHILDREN WITH DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY. BACKGROUND: DUCHENE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY (DMD) IS A PROGRESSIVE MUSCULAR DISORDER. CARDIAC DISORDER IS THE SECOND-MOST COMMON CAUSE OF DEATH IN CHILDREN WITH DMD, WITH 10%-20% OF THEM DYING OF CARDIAC FAILURE. HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) IS SHOWN TO BE A PREDICTOR OF CARDIO-AUTONOMIC FUNCTION. PHYSIOTHERAPY (PT) IS ADVISED FOR THESE CHILDREN AS A REGULAR TREATMENT FOR MAINTAINING THEIR FUNCTIONAL STATUS. THE EFFECT OF YOGIC PRACTICES ON THE CARDIO-AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED IN VARIOUS NEUROLOGICAL CONDITIONS AND MAY PROVE BENEFICIAL IN DMD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IN THIS STUDY, 124 PATIENTS WITH DMD WERE RANDOMIZED TO PT ALONE OR PT WITH YOGA INTERVENTION. HOME-BASED PT AND YOGA WERE ADVISED. ADHERENCE WAS SERIALLY ASSESSED AT A FOLLOW-UP INTERVAL OF 3 MONTHS. ERROR-FREE, ELECTROCARDIOGRAM WAS RECORDED IN ALL PATIENTS AT REST IN THE SUPINE POSITION. HRV PARAMETERS WERE COMPUTED IN TIME AND FREQUENCY DOMAINS. HRV WAS RECORDED AT BASELINE AND AT AN INTERVAL OF 3 MONTHS UP TO 1 YEAR. REPEATED-MEASURES ANOVA WAS USED TO ANALYZE LONGITUDINAL FOLLOW-UP AND LEAST SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE FOR POST HOC ANALYSIS AND P < 0.05 WAS CONSIDERED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. RESULTS: IN OUR STUDY, WITH PT PROTOCOL, STANDARD DEVIATION OF NN, ROOT OF SQUARE MEAN OF SUCCESSIVE NN, TOTAL POWER, LOW FREQUENCY, HIGH-FREQUENCY NORMALIZED UNITS (HFNU), AND SYMPATHOVAGAL BALANCE IMPROVED AT VARYING TIME POINTS AND THE IMPROVEMENT LASTED UP FOR 6-9 MONTHS, WHEREAS PT AND YOGA PROTOCOL SHOWED AN IMPROVEMENT IN HFNU DURING THE LAST 3 MONTHS OF THE STUDY PERIOD AND ALL THE OTHER PARAMETERS WERE STABLE UP TO 1 YEAR. THUS, IT IS EVIDENT THAT BOTH THE GROUPS IMPROVED CARDIAC FUNCTIONS IN DMD. HOWEVER, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS NOTED IN THE CHANGES OBSERVED BETWEEN THE GROUPS. CONCLUSION: THE INTENSE PT AND PT WITH YOGA, PARTICULARLY HOME-BASED PROGRAM, IS INDEED BENEFICIAL AS A THERAPEUTIC STRATEGY IN DMD CHILDREN TO MAINTAIN AND/OR TO SUSTAIN HRV IN DMD.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
19 1023  36 EFFECTS OF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS PRACTICES ON THE AUTONOMOUS NERVOUS SYSTEM IN PRIMARY SCHOOL CHILDREN: A NON-RANDOMISED CONTROLLED STUDY. OBJECTIVES: THE PRESENT STUDY EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED PROGRAMME ON THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM OF PRIMARY SCHOOL CHILDREN BY USING HEART RATE VARIABILITY PARAMETERS. DESIGN: A TWO-ARM NON-RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARED AN INTEGRATED YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED PROGRAMME (16 WEEKS) TO CONVENTIONAL PRIMARY SCHOOL LESSONS. SETTING: PRIMARY SCHOOL CLASSROOMS AND CONFERENCE ROOMS. INTERVENTIONS: PARTICIPANTS WERE ALLOCATED TO A 16-WEEK INTEGRATED YOGA-BASED PROGRAMME OR CONVENTIONAL SCHOOL LESSONS. A SUBGROUP WAS RANDOMISED TO RECEIVE 24H ELECTROCARDIOGRAM-RECORDINGS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: HEART RATE VARIABILITY INDICES WERE MEASURED, BOTH LINEAR (TIME AND FREQUENCY DOMAIN) AND NON-LINEAR (SYMBOLIC DYNAMICS, COMPRESSION ENTROPY), CALCULATED FROM 30-MINUTE EXTRACTS OF HOLTER-ELECTROCARDIOGRAM-RECORDINGS. ASSESSMENTS WERE CONDUCTED AT BASELINE AND AT THE END OF INTERVENTION. RESULTS: 40 PARTICIPANTS (42.5% FEMALE) WERE INCLUDED INTO THE ANALYSIS OF HRV. NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN HEART RATE VARIABILITY PARAMETERS WERE OBSERVED BETWEEN THE GROUPS AFTER 16 WEEKS. IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP, A TREND TOWARDS INCREASED PARASYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY COULD BE SEEN OVER TIME, ALTHOUGH NOT SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: RESULTS OBTAINED HERE DO NOT CLEARLY SHOW THAT CHILDREN IN GERMAN PRIMARY SCHOOL SETTINGS BENEFIT FROM AN INTEGRATED YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION. HOWEVER, EXPLORATORY POST-HOC ANALYSES POINT INTERESTINGLY TO AN INCREASED NOCTURNAL PARASYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP. FURTHER STUDIES ARE REQUIRED WITH HIGH-QUALITY STUDY DESIGNS, LARGER SAMPLE SIZES AND LONGER-TERM FOLLOW-UPS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
20 1062  34 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IN WOMEN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF A 12-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IN DEPRESSED WOMEN. METHODS: THIS WAS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. TWENTY-SIX SEDENTARY WOMEN SCORING >/=14 ON THE BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY-II WERE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER THE YOGA OR THE CONTROL GROUP. THE YOGA GROUP COMPLETED A 12-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM, WHICH TOOK PLACE TWICE A WEEK FOR 60 MIN PER SESSION AND CONSISTED OF BREATHING EXERCISES, YOGA POSE PRACTICE, AND SUPINE MEDITATION/RELAXATION. THE CONTROL GROUP WAS INSTRUCTED NOT TO ENGAGE IN ANY YOGA PRACTICE AND TO MAINTAIN THEIR USUAL LEVEL OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY DURING THE COURSE OF THE STUDY. PARTICIPANTS' HRV, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, AND PERCEIVED STRESS WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND POST-TEST. RESULTS: THE YOGA GROUP HAD A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN HIGH-FREQUENCY HRV AND DECREASES IN LOW-FREQUENCY HRV AND LOW FREQUENCY/HIGH FREQUENCY RATIO AFTER THE INTERVENTION. THE YOGA GROUP ALSO REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND PERCEIVED STRESS. NO CHANGE WAS FOUND IN THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: A 12-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM WAS EFFECTIVE IN INCREASING PARASYMPATHETIC TONE AND REDUCING DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND PERCEIVED STRESS IN WOMEN WITH ELEVATED DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE MAY BE RECOMMENDED FOR WOMEN TO COPE WITH THEIR DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND STRESS AND TO IMPROVE THEIR HRV.	2017

1 1996 207 STAY MINDFULLY ACTIVE DURING THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC: A FEASIBILITY STUDY OF MHEALTH-DELIVERED MINDFULNESS YOGA PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE. IMPORTANCE: PATIENTS WITH LONG-TERM NEUROLOGICAL CONDITIONS, SUCH AS PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD), ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH MEASURES TAKEN TO COMBAT THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE INACCESSIBILITY OF CENTER-BASED REHABILITATION FURTHER AGGRAVATED THEIR MOTOR DYSFUNCTIONS AS WELL AS MENTAL DISTRESS, LEADING TO EXACERBATION OF MOTOR AND NON-MOTOR SYMPTOMS, HIGH HEALTHCARE UTILIZATION AND WORSENED HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL). OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY, SAFETY, AND PRELIMINARY EFFECTS OF THE MHEALTH-DELIVERED HOME-BASED MINDFULNESS YOGA PROGRAM ON FUNCTIONAL BALANCE, MOTOR SYMPTOMS, MENTAL HEALTH AND HRQOL IN PATIENTS WITH PD. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: THIS PROSPECTIVE, SINGLE-ARM, NON-RANDOMIZED FEASIBILITY STUDY ADOPTED A SEQUENTIAL EXPLANATORY MIXED-METHOD DESIGN. ADULTS (AGED >/= 18) WITH A CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS OF IDIOPATHIC PARKINSON'S DISEASE (HOEHN AND YAHR STAGE I TO III) WHO WERE ABLE TO STAND UNAIDED AND WALK WITH OR WITHOUT AN ASSISTIVE DEVICE WERE ENROLLED VIA CONVENIENCE SAMPLING. INTERVENTION: HOME-BASED MINDFULNESS YOGA TRAINING WERE DELIVERED VIA VIDEO-CONFERENCING SOFTWARE (ZOOM) IN EIGHT BI-WEEKLY 90-MIN SESSIONS. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: THIS CURRENT STUDY MEASURED FUNCTIONAL BALANCE, MOTOR SYMPTOMS, PERCEIVED BALANCE CONFIDENCE, PERCEIVED FREEZING OF GAIT SYMPTOMS, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, MINDFULNESS AND HRQOL USING A TELE-ASSESSMENT APPROACH AT BASELINE AND 1-WEEK POST-INTERVENTION. ALL PARTICIPANTS WERE INVITED TO ATTEND QUALITATIVE INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS TO EXPLORE THEIR EXPERIENCE OF USING ONLINE MINDFULNESS YOGA PROGRAM AS A LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION FOR PD REHABILITATION. RESULTS: AMONG THE TEN PATIENTS, 80% COMPLETED THE PROGRAM WITH AN ADHERENCE RATE OF 98.4%. ALL PARTICIPANTS WERE ABLE TO LEARN AND PRACTICE MINDFULNESS YOGA FOLLOWING THE EIGHT BI-WEEKLY ONLINE MINDFULNESS YOGA TRAINING SESSIONS, WITHOUT ANY SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EVENTS. TELE-ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOMES WERE FEASIBLE AND UNEVENTFUL. QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK REVEALED PARTICIPANTS HAD A HIGH PREFERENCE OF USING THE TELE-REHABILITATION APPROACH TO STAY MINDFUL AND BEING ACTIVE, BOTH PHYSICALLY AND SOCIALLY, WHILE CONFRONTING THE CHANGES BROUGHT BY COVID-19 PANDEMIC. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: THE MHEALTH-DELIVERED HOME-BASED MINDFULNESS YOGA INTERVENTION WAS FEASIBLE, SAFE, AND WELL-ACCEPTED AMONG PEOPLE WITH PD TO RELIEVE THE BURDEN BROUGHT BY COVID-19 PANDEMIC. FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD ADOPT A DESIGN WITH ENHANCED RIGOR, A COMPARISON GROUP, AND ENLARGED SAMPLE SIZE TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF THE PROGRAM IN PATIENTS WITH LONG-TERM NEUROLOGICAL CONDITIONS AND/OR PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENTS. WE RECOMMEND A LONGER INTERVENTION DURATION OF AT LEAST 8 WEEKS TO ENHANCE THE PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS.	2022	

2 1710  45 PERCEIVED ACTIVITIES AND PARTICIPATION OUTCOMES OF A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE: A MIXED METHODS STUDY. PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD) OFTEN LEADS TO POOR BALANCE, INCREASED FALLS, AND FEAR OF FALLING, ALL OF WHICH CAN REDUCE PARTICIPATION IN LIFE ACTIVITIES. YOGA, WHICH USUALLY INCLUDES PHYSICAL EXERCISE, CAN IMPROVE FUNCTIONING AND LIFE PARTICIPATION; HOWEVER, LIMITED RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONDUCTED ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON LIFE PARTICIPATION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH PD. THIS STUDY HAD TWO PURPOSES: (1) TO IDENTIFY AND UNDERSTAND THE PERCEIVED ACTIVITIES AND PARTICIPATION OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED A THERAPEUTIC YOGA INTERVENTION FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH PD; AND (2) TO COMPARE THE PERCEIVED ACTIVITIES AND PARTICIPATION OUTCOMES WITH THE OUTCOMES MEASURED IN THE CLINICAL TRIAL. A SINGLE-BLIND, RANDOMIZED, WAITLIST-CONTROLLED, PHASE II EXPLORATORY PILOT STUDY USING AN AFTER-TRIAL EMBEDDED MIXED METHODS DESIGN (CLINICAL TRIAL PRO00041068) EVALUATED THE EFFECT OF AN 8-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION ON INDIVIDUALS WITH PD. DIRECTED CONTENT ANALYSIS WAS USED TO ANALYZE FOCUS GROUP INTERVIEWS WITH PARTICIPANTS WHO COMPLETED THE YOGA INTERVENTION. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA WERE MERGED AND COMPARED USING A DATA COMPARISON MATRIX. QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS INDICATED MANY ACTIVITIES AND PARTICIPATION OUTCOMES. COMPARISON OF QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DATA INDICATED THE YOGA INTERVENTION LED TO IMPROVED BALANCE, MOBILITY, AND FUNCTIONAL GAIT, AND FEWER FALLS. THESE OUTCOMES REACHED BEYOND THE INTERVENTION AND INTO PARTICIPANTS' DAILY LIVES. RESULTS SUPPORT THE USE OF HATHA YOGA AS A COMMUNITY-BASED REHABILITATION INTERVENTION FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH PD. YOGA, AS PART OF AN INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH TO TREATMENT, CAN IMPROVE MANY TYPES OF ACTIVITIES AND PARTICIPATION OUTCOMES (E.G., MOBILITY, SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS, SELF-CARE, HANDLING STRESS, RECREATION).	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
3 2194  59 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA VERSUS STRETCHING AND RESISTANCE TRAINING EXERCISES ON PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS FOR PEOPLE WITH MILD-TO-MODERATE PARKINSON'S DISEASE: STUDY PRXOTOCOL FOR A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS IS PREVALENT AMONG PEOPLE WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD) AND AGGRAVATES THEIR MOTOR SYMPTOMS, THEREBY LEADING TO INCREASED DISABILITY, HIGH HEALTHCARE COSTS, AND POOR HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL). THE UNDER-RECOGNITION AND ADVERSE EFFECTS OF THE PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AMONG THE PD POPULATION ARE CONSIDERABLE. THUS, ADOPTING A COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MANAGEMENT (CAM) APPROACH TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM IS IMPORTANT. YOGA, ONE OF THE MOST COMMON "MIND-BODY" CAM THERAPIES, CAN IMPROVE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING OF PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC ILLNESSES. HOWEVER, LIMITED RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN PEOPLE WITH PD HAS BEEN CONDUCTED. THIS STUDY WILL DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING OF PEOPLE WITH MILD-TO-MODERATE PD AND WILL COMPARE THESE EFFECTS WITH THOSE OF STRETCHING AND RESISTANCE TRAINING EXERCISES. METHODS: A COMMUNITY-BASED, SINGLE-BLIND, RANDOMIZED TRIAL WILL BE CONDUCTED. A TOTAL OF 126 SUBJECTS WILL BE RECRUITED AND RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO YOGA (N = 63) OR STRETCHING AND RESISTANCE EXERCISE (N = 63) GROUPS. FOR 8 WEEKS, THE YOGA GROUP WILL RECEIVE A WEEKLY 90-MIN SESSION OF YOGA, AND THE CONTROL GROUP WILL RECEIVE A WEEKLY 60-MIN SESSION OF STRETCHING AND RESISTANCE EXERCISES. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WILL BE THE LEVEL OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS MEASURED USING THE HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE. THE SECONDARY OUTCOMES WILL INCLUDE THE SEVERITY OF MOTOR SYMPTOMS MEASURED BY THE MOVEMENT DISORDERS SOCIETY - UNIFIED PARKINSON'S DISEASE SCALE - PART III MOTOR EXAMINATION; MOBILITY, BALANCE, AND FALL RISK MEASURED BY THE TIMED UP AND GO TEST; SPIRITUAL WELLBEING MEASURED BY THE HOLISTIC WELLBEING SCALE; AND HRQOL MEASURED BY THE PARKINSON'S DISEASE QUESTIONNAIRE-8. ASSESSMENT WILL BE CONDUCTED AT BASELINE, 8TH, AND 20TH WEEKS OF FOLLOW-UPS. DISCUSSION: THIS STUDY WILL BE THE FIRST RANDOMIZED TRIAL TO COMPARE THE EFFECT OF YOGA VERSUS STRETCHING AND RESISTANCE TRAINING EXERCISES IN A PD POPULATION. RESULTS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE VALUE OF YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC OPTION FOR MANAGING PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS IN PD PATIENTS. MULTIPLE OUTCOMES INCLUDING PSYCHOLOGICAL, PHYSIOLOGICAL, AND SPIRITUAL AND HRQOL WILL ALSO BE MEASURED TO ELUCIDATE THE POTENTIAL MECHANISMS OF YOGA. THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC ILLNESSES WILL FURTHER BE ELUCIDATED. THIS INFORMATION SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO FUTURE RESEARCH, PRACTICE, AND POLICY RELATED TO PD MANAGEMENT.

4  680  53 EFFECT OF A YOGA PROGRAMME ON AN INDIVIDUAL WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE: A SINGLE-SUBJECT DESIGN. PURPOSE: TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF EIGHT WEEKLY YOGA SESSIONS ON BALANCE, MOBILITY AND REPORTED QUALITY OF LIFE OF AN INDIVIDUAL WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD). FURTHERMORE, TO TEST THE METHODOLOGY IN ORDER TO INFORM FUTURE RESEARCH. METHOD: A 69-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH AN 8-YEAR HISTORY OF PD (HOEHN AND YAHR RATING TWO) WAS SELECTED FOR THE STUDY, WHICH HAD A SINGLE SUBJECT ABA DESIGN. A 1-WEEK BASELINE WAS FOLLOWED BY AN 8-WEEK PERIOD OF WEEKLY 60 MIN YOGA CLASSES AND A FURTHER 5 WEEKS OF TREATMENT WITHDRAWAL. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES USED WERE BERG BALANCE SCALE (BBS), TIMED UP AND GO (TUG) AND THE PARKINSON'S DISEASE QUESTIONNAIRE-39 (PDQ-39); COLLECTED AT BASELINE, BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION AND AT FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: AN IMPROVEMENT WAS NOTED IN THE BBS AND TUG DURING THE INTERVENTION PHASE; ALTHOUGH THESE CHANGES DID NOT APPEAR TO BE CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT. NO CHANGE IN QUALITY OF LIFE AS MEASURED BY THE PDQ-39 WAS NOTED. CONCLUSIONS: THE OBJECTIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITIES DURING THE INTERVENTION PERIOD WERE NOT CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT. SUBJECTIVELY, THE PARTICIPANT GAINED MUCH ENJOYMENT AND RELAXATION FROM THE YOGA CLASSES. THIS STUDY JUSTIFIES THE NEED FOR FURTHER STUDIES USING A LARGER SAMPLE SIZE. ADDITIONALLY, IT WILL INFORM THE METHODOLOGICAL DESIGN.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
5 1006  50 EFFECTS OF MINDFULNESS YOGA VERSUS CONVENTIONAL PHYSICAL EXERCISES ON SYMPTOM EXPERIENCES AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN PEOPLE WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE: THE POTENTIAL MEDIATING ROLES OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. BACKGROUND: ALTHOUGH SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE REPORTED POSITIVE EFFECTS OF MIND-BODY EXERCISES ON SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD), IT IS NOT KNOWN WHETHER THESE EFFECTS ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO A CHANGE IN ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. PURPOSE: TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF MINDFULNESS YOGA TO CONVENTIONAL STRETCHING EXERCISES IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WHILE EXAMINING POTENTIALLY MEDIATING EFFECTS OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. METHODS: 138 ADULTS WITH PD WERE RANDOMIZED TO EIGHT WEEKLY YOGA (N = 71) OR STRETCHING (N = 67) SESSIONS. SYMPTOM EXPERIENCES, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, AND HRQOL OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE, IMMEDIATE POST-INTERVENTION, AND 3-MONTH POST-INTERVENTION. RESULTS: GENERALIZED ESTIMATING EQUATION ANALYSES REVEALED THAT, COMPARED TO STRETCHING, YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED PATIENTS' NONMOTOR (TIME-BY-GROUP INTERACTION, T1:BETA = -1.99, P = .008; T2:BETA = -2.86, P < .001) AND MOTOR (TIME-BY-GROUP INTERACTION, T1:BETA = -1.77, P = .03) SYMPTOM EXPERIENCES. THE MEDIATION ANALYSIS FOUND THAT THE CHANGES IN ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION WERE THE MEDIATORS IN THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN NON-MOTOR EXPERIENCE AND HRQOL; WHILE ONLY THE CHANGES IN DEPRESSION WERE FOUND TO BE THE MEDIATOR IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MOTOR EXPERIENCE AND HRQOL. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA IS SUPERIOR TO CONVENTIONAL STRETCHING EXERCISES IN IMPROVING NONMOTOR AND MOTOR SYMPTOMS IN DAILY LIVING. REDUCED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION PLAY A ROLE IN MEDIATING THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF THE MINDFULNESS YOGA INTERVENTION. TO OPTIMIZE HRQOL, REHABILITATION SHOULD REINFORCE PSYCHOLOGICAL CARE IN ADDITION TO PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENTS AND PHYSICAL RELIEF OF PD SYMPTOMS. FUTURE STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO IDENTIFY STRATEGIES FOR FACILITATING THE IMPLEMENTATION AND SUSTAINABILITY OF MIND-BODY REHABILITATION TO ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF CARE FOR PD.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
6 2695  38 YOGA INFLUENCES RECOVERY DURING INPATIENT REHABILITATION: A PILOT STUDY. PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ADD YOGA THERAPY TO INPATIENT REHABILITATION AND ASSESS WHETHER PATIENTS CHOSE TO ENGAGE IN YOGA THERAPY IN ADDITION TO OTHER DAILY THERAPIES, TO DESCRIBE PATIENTS' PERCEPTIONS OF HOW YOGA THERAPY INFLUENCED RECOVERY, AND TO ASSESS AND DESCRIBE PATIENT SATISFACTION WITH THE PROGRAM. METHODS: THIS WAS A SINGLE-ARM PILOT STUDY, ADDING YOGA THERAPY TO ONGOING INPATIENT REHABILITATION. YOGA THERAPY WAS OFFERED AS GROUP YOGA OR INDIVIDUAL YOGA TWICE A WEEK. SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW QUESTIONS WERE COMPLETED VIA TELEPHONE POST-DISCHARGE. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 55 OF THE 77 (71%) PEOPLE CONTACTED ABOUT THE STUDY ENGAGED IN YOGA THERAPY IN THE INPATIENT REHABILITATION SETTING FOR THIS STUDY AND 31 (56%) OF THESE COMPLETED THE SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW QUESTIONS. QUALITATIVE DATA SUPPORT THAT PARTICIPANTS PERCEIVED THAT YOGA THERAPY IMPROVED BREATHING, RELAXATION, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING. OVERALL, PARTICIPANTS WERE SATISFIED WITH THE PROGRAM, ALTHOUGH THEY OFTEN INDICATED THEY WOULD LIKE INCREASED FLEXIBILITY OR FREQUENCY OF YOGA. ALMOST ALL PARTICIPANTS (97%) SAID THEY WOULD RECOMMEND THE YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM TO OTHERS IN INPATIENT REHABILITATION. CONCLUSION: WE WERE ABLE TO ADD YOGA THERAPY TO ONGOING INPATIENT REHABILITATION AND PARTICIPANTS PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF HAVING THE YOGA THERAPY IN THEIR REHABILITATION STAY.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
7 1243  52 FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA, AEROBIC AND STRETCHING-TONING EXERCISE PROGRAM FOR ADULT CANCER SURVIVORS: THE STAYFIT TRIAL. BACKGROUND: THE USE OF YOGA AS A MIND-BODY PRACTICE HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY POPULAR AMONG CLINICAL POPULATIONS AND OLDER ADULTS WHO USE THIS PRACTICE TO MANAGE AGE AND CHRONIC DISEASE-RELATED SYMPTOMS. ALTHOUGH YOGA CONTINUES TO GAIN POPULARITY AMONG PRACTITIONERS AND RESEARCHERS, PILOT STUDIES THAT EXAMINE ITS FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY, ESPECIALLY AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS, ARE LIMITED. FEASIBILITY STUDIES PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN DETERMINING WHETHER THE TARGET POPULATION IS LIKELY TO ENGAGE WITH LARGER SCALE EFFICACY AND EFFECTIVENESS TRIALS. IN THIS PAPER WE PRESENT FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY DATA FROM A 12-WEEK RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) CONDUCTED WITH ADULT CANCER SURVIVORS. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS N = 78 (MEAN AGE: 55 YEARS) WERE RANDOMIZED TO ONE OF THREE GROUPS: A HATHA YOGA, AEROBIC EXERCISE, OR STRETCHING-TONING CONTROL GROUP WITH GROUP EXERCISE CLASSES HELD FOR 150 MIN/WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS. HEREIN WE REPORT FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY, INCLUDING ENROLLMENT RATES, ATTENDANCE, ATTRITION AND ADVERSE EVENTS, AND PARTICIPANT FEEDBACK AND SATISFACTION DATA. RESULTS: OF THE 233 ADULTS SCREENED, 109 WERE ELIGIBLE AND 78 RANDOMIZED TO ONE OF THE THREE INTERVENTION ARMS. SESSION ATTENDANCE WAS HIGH FOR ALL GROUPS (75.5-89.5%) AND 17 PARTICIPANTS DROPPED OUT DURING THE 12-WEEK INTERVENTION. PROGRAM SATISFACTION WAS HIGH (4.8 OR HIGHER OUT OF 5) AND NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. ONE COHORT (N = 15) OF THE INTERVENTION TRANSITIONED TO REMOTE INTERVENTION DELIVERY DUE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. FEASIBILITY DATA FROM THESE PARTICIPANTS SUGGESTED THAT SYNCHRONIZED GROUP EXERCISE CLASSES VIA ZOOM WITH A LIVE INSTRUCTOR WERE ACCEPTABLE AND ENJOYABLE. PARTICIPANT FEEDBACK REGARDING MOST AND LEAST HELPFUL ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM AS WELL AS SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE YOGA INTERVENTIONS ARE SUMMARIZED. CONCLUSIONS: OVERALL, THE YOGA INTERVENTION WAS HIGHLY FEASIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE. THE FEASIBILITY PARAMETERS FROM THIS TRIAL CAN AID RESEARCHERS IN ESTIMATING RECRUITMENT RATES FOR DESIRED SAMPLE SIZES TO SUCCESSFULLY RANDOMIZE AND RETAIN CANCER SURVIVORS IN SHORT- AND LONG-TERM YOGA-BASED EFFICACY AND EFFECTIVENESS TRIALS. THE FINDINGS ALSO PROVIDE EVIDENCE TO CLINICIANS WHO CAN RECOMMEND UP TO 150 MIN OF A COMBINATION OF EXERCISES-AEROBIC, YOGA, OR STRETCHING-TONING TO THEIR CANCER PATIENTS IN ORDER TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND WELLBEING DURING CANCER SURVIVORSHIP.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
8  420  48 BRIDGING BODY AND MIND: CASE SERIES OF A 10-WEEK TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA PROTOCOL FOR VETERANS. THIS CASE SERIES EXPLORED THE FEASIBILITY AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF THERAPEUTIC YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY FORM OF TREATMENT FOR COMBAT-RELATED TRAUMA. THE SERIES RECRUITED FOR AND IMPLEMENTED A 10-WEEK TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA PROTOCOL FOR VETERANS IN AN INTERPROFESSIONAL COMMUNITY HEALTH TREATMENT SETTING. PARTICIPANTS WERE ENROLLED IN A SERIES OF 90-MINUTE THERAPEUTIC YOGA CLASSES ADAPTED TO BE TRAUMA-INFORMED. FEASIBILITY WAS MEASURED BY RECRUITMENT, RETENTION, AND LEVEL OF PARTICIPATION IN THE STUDY. PRELIMINARY EFFICACY WAS EXPLORED VIA THE POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER CHECKLIST, SCALE OF BODY CONNECTION, PROMIS-29, PROMIS ALCOHOL USE, PROMIS SUBSTANCE USE, DIFFICULTIES IN EMOTIONAL REGULATION SCALE, AND SELF-COMPASSION SCALE-SHORT FORM. ALL MEASURES WERE ADMINISTERED AT BASELINE, WEEK 5, WEEK 10, AND AT A 5-WEEK FOLLOW-UP. A QUALITATIVE FEASIBILITY QUESTIONNAIRE WAS ADMINISTERED WEEKLY AND AT THE 5-WEEK FOLLOW-UP TO ASSESS BARRIERS AND MOTIVATORS FOR HOME PRACTICE AND TO COLLECT FEEDBACK ABOUT SESSION CONTENT. RECRUITMENT CHALLENGES RESULTED IN ONLY SEVEN INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS. FOUR PARTICIPANTS (THREE MALES, ONE FEMALE) WERE SUCCESSFULLY ENROLLED IN THE STUDY AFTER SEVEN PHONE SCREENINGS AND FIVE IN-PERSON INTERVIEWS. THE FOUR ENROLLED CLIENTS HAD A 100% FOLLOW-UP RETENTION RATE, REPORTED NO ADVERSE EVENTS, AND ON AVERAGE PARTICIPATED IN 85% OF CLASSES. CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENTS WERE OBSERVED ON TRAUMA- AND BODY CONNECTION-RELATED SCALES FOR THREE PARTICIPANTS FROM BASELINE TO FOLLOW-UP. QUALITATIVE DATA REVEALED THAT MOTIVATORS TO PRACTICE INCLUDE IN-SESSION PHILOSOPHICAL DISCUSSIONS BASED ON PSYCHOLOGICAL THEMES; BREATHWORK; MINDFULNESS; AND PHYSICAL, SOCIAL, WORK/ACADEMIC, AND MENTAL HEALTH IMPACT. BARRIERS INCLUDED MOTIVATION, TIME, AND LOCATION. IMPORTANT THEMES EMERGED RELATED TO CULTURAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR VETERANS. ALTHOUGH THIS 10-WEEK TRAUMA-INFORMED PROTOCOL FACED CHALLENGES TO RECRUITMENT, RETENTION AND PARTICIPATION WERE HIGH. EFFICACY MEASURES YIELDED PROMISING RESULTS FOR REDUCING TRAUMA-RELATED SYMPTOMS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
9   87  54 A MIXED METHODS EVALUATION OF AN INDIVIDUALISED YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS: PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVES: TO EXPLORE PATIENTS' EXPERIENCES OF AN INDIVIDUALISED YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA), SPECIFICALLY IN TERMS OF ITS ACCEPTABILITY AND IMPACT ON PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES. DESIGN: TEN PATIENTS TOOK PART IN A 16 WEEK YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION IN A HOSPITAL SETTING, CONSISTING OF 10 ONE-TO-ONE CONSULTATIONS WITH A YOGA THERAPIST FOLLOWED BY TWO GROUP REVIEW SESSIONS. CHANGES IN HEALTH (EQ-5D, HADS) WERE ASSESSED PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION AND AT 12-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED POST-INTERVENTION AND ANALYSED USING THEMATIC ANALYSIS. RESULTS: ATTENDANCE OF THE 1-TO-1 SESSIONS WAS HIGH (98 %) AND ALL PARTICIPANTS REPORTED STRONG COMMITMENT TO THEIR PERSONALISED HOME PRACTICE. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN MEASURES OF DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, PAIN, QUALITY OF LIFE AND GENERAL HEALTH AT POST-INTERVENTION AND 12-MONTHS (P < 0.05). IN INTERVIEWS, ALL BUT ONE PARTICIPANT REPORTED POSITIVE CHANGES TO THEIR SYMPTOMS AND SEVERAL REPORTED REDUCTIONS IN THEIR MEDICATION AND BROADER BENEFITS SUCH AS IMPROVED SLEEP, MOOD AND ENERGY, ENABLING RE-ENGAGEMENT WITH LIFE. THE PERSONALLY TAILORED NATURE OF THE PRACTICE AND PERCEIVED BENEFITS WERE KEY MOTIVATIONAL FACTORS. PARTICULAR VALUE WAS PLACED ON THE THERAPEUTIC FUNCTION OF THE CONSULTATION AND PROVISION OF TOOLS TO MANAGE STRESS AND BUILD RESILIENCE. CONCLUSION: THIS YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION WAS POSITIVELY RECEIVED BY PATIENTS WITH RA, WITH HIGH LEVELS OF ADHERENCE TO BOTH THE TREATMENTS AND TAILORED HOME PRACTICE. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA THERAPY HAS POTENTIAL AS AN ADJUNCT THERAPY TO IMPROVE RA SYMPTOMS, INCREASE SELF-CARE BEHAVIOURS AND MANAGE STRESS AND NEGATIVE AFFECT SUCH AS ANXIETY. A LARGER MULTI-CENTRE STUDY IS THEREFORE WARRANTED.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
10  112  48 A PILOT STUDY OF A MINDFULNESS INFORMED YOGA INTERVENTION IN YOUNG PEOPLE WITH PSYCHOSIS. AIM: TO DETERMINE THE ACCEPTABILITY AND SAFETY OF A MINDFULNESS INFORMED YOGA INTERVENTION AS ADJUNCT TO USUAL CARE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WITH EARLY PSYCHOSIS. METHODS: PEOPLE AGED 16-25 YEARS ATTENDING A COMMUNITY-BASED SPECIALIST EARLY PSYCHOSIS CLINIC WERE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN A 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. THE INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF 1-H WEEKLY CLASSES OF MINDFULNESS INFORMED YOGA. ACCEPTABILITY WAS MEASURED BY UPTAKE, ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPANTS' SATISFACTION. SAFETY WAS MEASURED BY INCIDENCE OF PHYSICAL INJURY, PARTICIPANTS' LEVEL OF COMFORT, DISTRESS AND ANXIETY DURING THE SESSIONS, AND THE FOLLOWING MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES: POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE PSYCHOTIC, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY AND STRESS SYMPTOMS, SLEEP QUALITY AND FUNCTIONING. RESULTS: OF THOSE WHO CONSENTED TO THE STUDY, 80% (12) PARTICIPATED AND ON AVERAGE ATTENDED 4.4 YOGA CLASSES. THERE WERE NO PHYSICAL INJURIES AND PARTICIPANTS REPORTED MINIMAL DISTRESS AND ANXIETY. POST-INTERVENTION, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND AN IMPROVEMENT IN FUNCTION. CONCLUSIONS: MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA INTERVENTIONS ARE BOTH ACCEPTABLE AND SAFE AS AN INTERVENTION FOR YOUTH WITH EARLY PSYCHOSIS. THOUGH NUMBERS WERE SMALL, THE STUDY SHOWS PROMISE FOR YOGA AS A POTENTIALLY USEFUL INTERVENTION. IMPORTANTLY, THERE WAS NO DETERIORATION IN MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES. A LARGER TRIAL EVALUATING CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS IS NOW TIMELY.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
11 2579  39 YOGA FOR HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN ADULT CANCER: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED FEASIBILITY STUDY. AN INCREASE IN PATIENT-LED UPTAKE OF COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN ADULT CANCER HAS LED TO A NEED FOR MORE RIGOROUS STUDY OF SUCH INTERVENTIONS AND THEIR OUTCOMES. THIS STUDY THEREFORE AIMED TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF A YOGA INTERVENTION IN MEN AND WOMEN RECEIVING CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT FOR A CANCER DIAGNOSIS. PROSPECTIVE, MIXED METHODS FEASIBILITY TRIAL ALLOCATED PARTICIPANTS TO RECEIVE ONE OF THREE YOGA INTERVENTIONS OVER A FOUR-WEEK STUDY PERIOD. DATA COLLECTION WAS COMPLETED THROUGH ONLINE SURVEY OF QOL-CA/CS AND CUSTOMIZED SURVEYS. FIFTEEN PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED (11 FEMALE) UNDERGOING TREATMENT FOR BREAST, PROSTATE, COLORECTAL, BRAIN, AND BLOOD AND LUNG CANCER. TWO PARTICIPANTS DROPPED OUT AND COMPLETE QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DATA SETS WERE COLLECTED FROM 12 PARTICIPANTS AND FOUR YOGA INSTRUCTORS. OTHER OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED IMPLEMENTATION COSTS PATIENT-REPORTED PREFERENCES FOR YOGA INTERVENTION AND CHANGES IN QOL-CA/CS. THREE TYPES OF YOGA INTERVENTION WERE SAFELY ADMINISTERED IN ADULT CANCER. MIXED METHODS, COST-EFFICIENCY, QOL-CA/CS, AND EVIDENCE-BASED DESIGN OF YOGA INTERVENTION HAVE BEEN USED TO ESTABLISH FEASIBILITY AND PATIENT-PREFERENCES FOR YOGA DELIVERY IN ADULT CANER. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT, WITH SOME METHODOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS, A LARGE-SCALE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IS WARRANTED TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR MALE AND FEMALE CANCER PATIENTS.

12 2673  38 YOGA IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE: A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY TO ACCESS THE EFFECTS ON QUALITY OF LIFE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. BACKGROUND: AND PURPOSE: YOGA IS GROWING IN POPULARITY, BUT ITS BENEFITS AND INTEGRATION INTO PRIMARY CARE REMAIN UNCERTAIN. HERE, WE DETERMINE YOGA EFFECTS ON QUALITY OF LIFE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, AND EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF INTRODUCING YOGA AT PRIMARY CARE LEVEL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS IS A PROSPECTIVE, LONGITUDINAL, QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY, WITH AN INTERVENTION (N=49) AND A CONTROL GROUP (N=37). YOGA GROUP UNDERWENT 24-WEEKS PROGRAM OF ONE-HOUR SESSIONS. OUR PRIMARY ENDPOINT WAS QUALITY OF LIFE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, AS WELL AS SATISFACTION LEVEL AND ADHERENCE RATE. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS REPORTED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ALL DOMAINS OF QUALITY OF LIFE AND A REDUCTION OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES PSYCHOLOGICAL QUALITY OF LIFE (P=0.046). CONCLUSION: YOGA IN PRIMARY CARE IS FEASIBLE, SAFE AND HAS A SATISFACTORY ADHERENCE, AS WELL AS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON PSYCHOLOGICAL QUALITY OF LIFE OF PARTICIPANTS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
13   14  49 "NOW I SEE A BRIGHTER DAY": EXPECTATIONS AND PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF AN IYENGAR YOGA INTERVENTION FOR YOUNG PATIENTS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA) IS A CHRONIC DISEASE CHARACTERIZED BY INFLAMMATION OF JOINTS AND ASSOCIATED FATIGUE, DETERIORATED RANGE OF MOTION, AND IMPAIRED PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING. YOUNG ADULTS WITH RA ARE AT A PARTICULAR RISK FOR COMPROMISED HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, AND THERE IS A NEED FOR SAFE, EFFECTIVE COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT IN ADDITION TO TRADITIONAL MEDICAL APPROACHES. THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO USE FACE-TO-FACE PARTICIPANT INTERVIEWS, CONDUCTED BEFORE AND AFTER AN IYENGAR YOGA (IY) PROGRAM, TO EXAMINE MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH YOGA MAY BE BENEFICIAL TO YOUNG ADULTS WITH RA.THIS PILOT STUDY UTILIZED A SINGLE-ARM DESIGN WHERE ALL PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED THE INTERVENTION. CLASSES WERE TAUGHT TWICE PER WEEK (1.5 HOURS EACH) FOR 6 WEEKS BY AN IY TEACHER QUALIFIED IN THERAPEUTICS. INTERVIEW THEMES INCLUDED PARTICIPANTS' BASELINE EXPECTATIONS ABOUT YOGA AND VIEWPOINTS AS TO HOW THEIR FUNCTIONING HAD BEEN IMPACTED BY THE IY INTERVENTION WERE EXAMINED. FIVE YOUNG ADULTS WITH RA AGED 24-31 YEARS (MEAN = 28; 80% FEMALE) COMPLETED THE YOGA INTERVENTION. PARTICIPANTS CONSISTENTLY REPORTED THAT YOGA HELPED WITH ENERGY, RELAXATION AND MOOD AND THEY DISCUSSED PERCEIVED MECHANISMS FOR HOW YOGA IMPACTED WELL-BEING. MECHANISMS INCLUDED PHYSICAL CHANGES SUCH AS RANGE OF MOTION AND PHYSIOLOGICAL AWARENESS, AND PSYCHOSPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENTS SUCH AS ACCEPTANCE, COPING, SELF-EFFICACY AND MINDFULNESS. THOUGH THE STUDY IS LIMITED, PARTICIPANTS' RESPONSES PROVIDE COMPELLING EVIDENCE THAT IY FOR RA PATIENTS IS AN INTERVENTION WORTHY OF FURTHER EXPLORATION. THE MECHANISMS AND OUTCOMES REPORTED BY PARTICIPANTS SUPPORT A BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL MODEL, WHICH PROPOSES THAT YOGA BENEFITS PATIENTS THROUGH BOTH PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOSPIRITUAL CHANGES.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
14 1892  43 RELAX WHILE YOU REHABILITATE: A PILOT STUDY INTEGRATING A NOVEL, YOGA-BASED MINDFULNESS GROUP INTERVENTION INTO A RESIDENTIAL MILITARY BRAIN INJURY REHABILITATION PROGRAM. OBJECTIVE: THIS PRELIMINARY, PILOT STUDY ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A GROUP-BASED, MINDFULNESS INTERVENTION IN A RESIDENTIAL, REHABILITATION SETTING WITH SPECIFIC FOCUS ON ASSESSING PARTICIPANTS' SELF-REPORT OF PERCEIVED BENEFIT OF THE INTERVENTION ON OVERALL HEALTH, PAIN, SLEEP, MOOD/ANXIETY, ATTENTION, AND SELF-AWARENESS, AS WELL AS IMPLEMENTING MODIFICATIONS NEEDED FOR SUCCESSFUL INTERVENTION APPLICATION AMONG A DIVERSE, CLINICAL MILITARY POPULATION. METHOD/DESIGN: PARTICIPANTS WERE 19 VETERANS AND ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBERS WITH A HISTORY OF TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI; 63% SEVERE) WHO COMPLETED A MINDFULNESS-BASED GROUP INTERVENTION DURING INPATIENT ADMISSION AT A VETERANS AFFAIRS POLYTRAUMA TRANSITIONAL REHABILITATION PROGRAM (PTRP). MINDFULNESS AND YOGA SKILLS WERE TAUGHT IN A REQUIRED, WEEKLY GROUP INCORPORATED INTO PARTICIPANTS' REHABILITATION SCHEDULE. OPINIONS AND ATTITUDES ABOUT MINDFULNESS, AS WELL AS PERTINENT SELF-REPORT OUTCOME MEASURES, WERE OBTAINED PRE- AND POSTGROUP PARTICIPATION. RESULTS: RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT PARTICIPATION IN THE GROUP WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH INDIVIDUALS' SELF-REPORTED BELIEF ABOUT THE BENEFIT OF MINDFULNESS IN THE AREAS OF OVERALL HEALTH, PHYSICAL HEALTH, MOOD, FOCUS, AND SELF-AWARENESS. THE MORE GROUPS ATTENDED, THE MORE POSITIVE THE PARTICIPANTS' BELIEFS ABOUT POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OVERALL HEALTH AND MOOD BECAME, EVEN WHILE CONTROLLING FOR LENGTH OF REHABILITATION STAY. ADDITIONALLY, SEVERAL SPECIFIC GROUP MODIFICATIONS RELEVANT TO THIS POPULATION (E.G., PHYSICAL/ENVIRONMENTAL MODIFICATIONS, REPETITION, IGNORING/REORIENTING) WERE IMPLEMENTED TO SUPPORT SUCCESSFUL PARTICIPATION. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: THESE PRELIMINARY AND EXPLORATORY FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT IT MAY BE WORTHWHILE FOR PSYCHOLOGISTS, CLINICIANS, AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WORKING WITH A MIXED TBI POPULATION, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY A MILITARY POPULATION WITH TBI, TO CONSIDER INTRODUCING MINDFULNESS SKILLS AS PART OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY REHABILITATION.

15 1248  51 FEASIBILITY OF YOGA TO IMPROVE SYMPTOMS IN INDIVIDUALS WITH SEVERE, CHRONIC TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY: A MIXED-METHODS CASE SERIES. CONTEXT: PEOPLE WITH SEVERE TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI) EXPERIENCE LIFELONG SEQUELAE THAT AFFECT PHYSICAL, COGNITIVE, AND MENTAL HEALTH. IN OTHER POPULATIONS, YOGA HAS SHOWN POTENTIAL TO ALLEVIATE INSOMNIA, PAIN, AND DEPRESSION AND TO IMPROVE COGNITION. OBJECTIVE: THE STUDY INTENDED TO INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF A SIX-WEEK, GROUP-YOGA INTERVENTION FOR ADULTS WITH SEVERE CHRONIC TBI, FOCUSING ON SLEEP, PAIN, MOOD, AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION. DESIGN: THE RESEARCH TEAM PERFORMED A FEASIBILITY STUDY USING A MIXED-METHODS, CASE-SERIES DESIGN. SETTING: THE STUDY RECRUITED PARTICIPANTS BY DISTRIBUTING FLYERS TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND TBI SUPPORT GROUPS. PARTICIPANTS: PARTICIPANTS WERE TWO PEOPLE WITH SEVERE, CHRONIC, TBI. INTERVENTION: THE INTERVENTION WAS A SIX-WEEK COURSE OF GROUP YOGA, WITH 70-MINUTE CLASSES TWICE A WEEK. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE STUDY ASSESSED OUTCOMES AT BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION USING VALIDATED MEASURES TO ASSESS EXECUTIVE FUNCTION, MOOD, SLEEP, AND PAIN: THE BEHAVIOR RATING INVENTORY OF EXECUTIVE FUNCTION-ADULT VERSION (BRIEF-A), BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY (BDI), PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI), AND NEUROPATHIC PAIN SCALE (NPS). A SEMISTRUCTURED INTERVIEW WAS CONDUCTED DURING THE WEEK POSTINTERVENTION TO OBTAIN QUALITATIVE DATA. RESULTS: THE STUDY HAD A 100% RETENTION RATE, A 91.67% ATTENDANCE RATE, AND HIGH SATISFACTION. ONE PARTICIPANT DEMONSTRATED IMPROVEMENT IN ALL OUTCOMES, WHILE THE OTHER SHOWED MIXED RESULTS. DEPRESSION SHOWED THE MOST CONSISTENT IMPROVEMENT, 47.2% ON AVERAGE. FOR INSOMNIA, ONE PARTICIPANT SHOWED IMPROVED SLEEP AT 14.29%. THE QUALITATIVE DATA DEMONSTRATED POSITIVE CHANGES IN COGNITION, MOOD, SLEEP, AND PAIN. CONCLUSIONS: A SIX-WEEK GROUP YOGA INTERVENTION IS FEASIBLE AND APPEARS TO BE BENEFICIAL IN ALLEVIATING SYMPTOMS, ESPECIALLY DEPRESSION AND INSOMNIA, IN PEOPLE WITH SEVERE CHRONIC TBI. A LONGER INTERVENTION PERIOD WAS SUGGESTED BY THE PARTICIPANTS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
16 1580  51 MEASURING THE EFFECT OF AN EIGHT-WEEK ADAPTIVE YOGA PROGRAM ON THE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STATUS OF INDIVIDUALS WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE. A PILOT STUDY. PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD) IS A NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE THAT AFFECTS MUSCLE TONE, STRENGTH, FLEXIBILITY, MOTOR CONTROL, PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTLOOK, COGNITION, AND FUNCTION. EXERCISE HAS BEEN FOUND TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL ABILITY AND PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTLOOK, BUT THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON INDIVIDUALS WITH PD HAS NOT BEEN WELL RESEARCHED. THE PURPOSES OF THIS STUDY WERE TO IDENTIFY OUTCOME MEASURES THAT WERE RESPONSIVE TO CHANGE IN INDIVIDUALS WITH PD AFTER AN 8-WEEK ADAPTIVE YOGA PROGRAM AND TO DETERMINE APPROPRIATE SAMPLE SIZES FOR FUTURE STUDIES. IN A REPEATED MEASURES DESIGN, 10 PARTICIPANTS WITH A HOEHN AND YAHR STAGE OF 2 OR 3 WERE TESTED PRIOR TO AND AFTER AN 8-WEEK CONTROL PHASE AND AGAIN AFTER THEY UNDERWENT AN 8-WEEK ADAPTIVE YOGA PROGRAM. ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA) TESTS REVEALED DIFFERENCES IN TIME OF MEASURE THAT APPROACHED SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE DEPRESSION SUBSCALE OF THE HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE (HADS) (P = 0.008) AND THE 30-SECOND CHAIR STAND (TSCS) (P = 0.013). THE INTERACTION BETWEEN TIME OF MEASURE AND GENDER APPROACHED SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE SIT-AND-REACH TEST (SRT) (P = 0.08 AND 0.03, RIGHT AND LEFT RESPECTIVELY), WITH MALE PARTICIPANTS IMPROVING IN SIT-AND-REACH FLEXIBILITY COMPARED WITH FEMALE PARTICIPANTS AFTER INTERVENTION. THE INTERACTION BETWEEN TIME OF MEASURE AND AGE APPROACHED SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE SINGLE-LEG BALANCE TEST (SLB) (P = 0.007), WITH YOUNGER PARTICIPANTS IMPROVING IN SLB TIME AFTER INTERVENTION. POWER CALCULATIONS FOUND THAT A SAMPLE SIZE RANGING FROM 33 TO 153 WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANCE AT THE 0.01 LEVEL IN THE VARIOUS OUTCOME MEASURES IN A FUTURE STUDY OF THIS DESIGN. THE DEPRESSION SUBSCALE OF THE HADS, THE TSCS, THE SLB, AND THE RIGHT AND LEFT SRT WERE THE MEASURES THAT CHANGED FOLLOWING THE YOGA INTERVENTION AND ARE RECOMMENDED AS OUTCOME MEASURES IN FUTURE STUDIES INVESTIGATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH PD. THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY SUPPORTS FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF ADAPTIVE YOGA USING A RANDOMIZED DESIGN AND A LARGER SAMPLE SIZE OF INDIVIDUALS WITH PD.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
17 1684  32 OPEN TRIAL OF VINYASA YOGA FOR PERSISTENTLY DEPRESSED INDIVIDUALS: EVIDENCE OF FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF VINYASA YOGA AS AN ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSED PATIENTS WHO WERE NOT RESPONDING ADEQUATELY TO ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATION. THE AUTHORS ALSO PLANNED TO ASK PARTICIPANTS FOR QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK ON THEIR EXPERIENCE OF THE CLASS AND TO ASSESS CHANGE OVER TIME IN DEPRESSION AND IN POSSIBLE MEDIATING VARIABLES. THE AUTHORS RECRUITED 11 PARTICIPANTS IN 1 MONTH FOR AN 8-WEEK OPEN TRIAL OF YOGA CLASSES. THEY FOUND THAT 10 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENTS, 9 OF 10 WERE POSITIVE ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE, AND ALL PROVIDED FEEDBACK ABOUT WHAT WAS AND WAS NOT HELPFUL ABOUT YOGA, AS WELL AS BARRIERS TO CLASS ATTENDANCE. OVER THE 2-MONTH PERIOD, PARTICIPANTS EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN AN ASPECT OF MINDFULNESS AND IN BEHAVIOR ACTIVATION. THIS PILOT STUDY PROVIDED SUPPORT FOR CONTINUING TO INVESTIGATE VINYASA YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION. THE NEXT STEP REQUIRED IS A RIGOROUS RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
18  593  39 DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF A YOGA INTERVENTION PROGRAM FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE. PRELIMINARY RESEARCH INDICATES THAT YOGA COULD BE A VALUABLE TOOL FOR PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD). HOWEVER, LITTLE HAS BEEN PUBLISHED ABOUT THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE YOGA INTERVENTIONS WERE DESIGNED AND EVALUATED. THIS STUDY ELABORATES ON THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING AND TESTING A BI-WEEKLY, 12-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM TO DETERMINE ITS SAFETY AND FEASIBILITY FOR PEOPLE WITH PD. THE LEAD YOGA TEACHER USED INPUT FROM A FOCUSED LITERATURE REVIEW TO DESIGN AN INITIAL DRAFT OF THE INTERVENTION PROGRAM. THIS DRAFT WAS REVIEWED BY A GROUP OF YOGA EXPERTS ( N = 6) TO DEVELOP THE FINAL INTERVENTION PROGRAM. THIS 12-WEEK INTERVENTION WAS IMPLEMENTED IN 19 PARTICIPANTS WITH PD (MEAN AGE 63 +/- 8, RANGE 49-75) VIA TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES. THROUGH THIS COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, A SERIES OF 24 INDIVIDUAL 1-HOUR YOGA SEQUENCES WAS CREATED. THESE SEQUENCES INCLUDED YOGA POSTURES (ASANA), BREATHING TECHNIQUES (PRANAYAMA), AND MINDFULNESS MEDITATION PRINCIPLES SPECIFICALLY CHOSEN TO ADDRESS CONCERNS UNIQUE TO THE PD POPULATION. THE FEASIBILITY OF THE PROGRAM WAS SUPPORTED WITH EXCELLENT ATTENDANCE: 90% OF PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED > 75% OF THE CLASSES, WITH FOUR PARTICIPANTS ATTENDING 100%. NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. THIS DEVELOPMENT PROCESS PRODUCED A SAFE AND ENJOYABLE YOGA PROGRAM SPECIFIC FOR THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH PD. HOWEVER, THIS METHODOLOGY COULD SERVE AS A TEMPLATE FOR FUTURE STUDIES ON HOW TO DEVELOP SAFE AND EFFECTIVE YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR OTHER POPULATIONS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
19 1230  42 FEASIBILITY AND OUTCOME OF AN ONLINE STREAMED YOGA INTERVENTION ON STRESS AND WELLBEING OF PEOPLE WORKING FROM HOME DURING COVID-19. BACKGROUND: THE OUTBREAK OF COVID-19 AND ITS ASSOCIATED MEASURES HAS RESULTED IN A SIZEABLE WORKING POPULATION TRANSITIONING TO WORKING FROM HOME (WFH), BRINGING ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES, AND INCREASING WORK-RELATED STRESS. RESEARCH HAS INDICATED THAT YOGA HAS PROMISING POTENTIAL IN REDUCING STRESS IN THE WORKPLACE. HOWEVER, THERE ARE VERY FEW STUDIES EXPLORING THE IMPACT OF ONLINE STREAMED YOGA ON STRESS MANAGEMENT FOR PEOPLE-WFH. OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY AND OUTCOME OF AN ONLINE STREAMED YOGA INTERVENTION ON STRESS AND WELLBEING OF PEOPLE-WFH DURING COVID-19. METHODS: A SIX-WEEK PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) YOGA INTERVENTION WAS DESIGNED WITH YOGA (N = 26) AND A WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 26). A MIXED TWO-WAY ANOVA WAS USED TO ASSESS CHANGES IN STANDARDISED OUTCOME MEASURES AT BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION. LIKERT AND OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS ASSESSED ENJOYMENT, ACCEPTABILITY AND PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM, WHICH WERE ANALYSED THEMATICALLY. RESULTS: COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL, THE YOGA GROUP REPORTED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN PERCEIVED STRESS, MENTAL WELLBEING, DEPRESSION AND COPING SELF-EFFICACY, BUT NOT STRESS AND ANXIETY. PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCED PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS AND REPORTED HIGH ACCEPTABILITY AND ENJOYMENT OF THE INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: AN ONLINE YOGA INTERVENTION CAN HELP PEOPLE WFH MANAGE STRESS AND ENHANCE WELLBEING AND COPING ABILITIES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
20 1529  54 IYENGAR YOGA FOR YOUNG ADULTS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS: RESULTS FROM A MIXED-METHODS PILOT STUDY. CONTEXT: RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA) IS A CHRONIC DISEASE THAT OFTEN IMPACTS PATIENT'S QUALITY OF LIFE. FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WITH RA, THERE IS A NEED FOR REHABILITATIVE APPROACHES THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE SAFE AND TO LEAD TO IMPROVED FUNCTIONING. OBJECTIVES: THIS PILOT STUDY INVESTIGATED THE FEASIBILITY OF A SINGLE-ARM, GROUP-ADMINISTERED, SIX-WEEK, BIWEEKLY IYENGAR YOGA (IY) PROGRAM FOR EIGHT YOUNG ADULTS WITH RA. METHODS: IY IS KNOWN FOR ITS USE OF PROPS, THERAPEUTIC SEQUENCES DESIGNED FOR PATIENT POPULATIONS, EMPHASIS ON ALIGNMENT, AND A RIGOROUS TEACHER TRAINING. TREATMENT OUTCOMES WERE EVALUATED USING A MIXED-METHODS APPROACH THAT COMBINED QUANTITATIVE RESULTS FROM STANDARDIZED QUESTIONNAIRES AND QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WITH PARTICIPANTS. RESULTS: INITIAL ATTRITION WAS 37% (N=3) AFTER THE FIRST WEEK BECAUSE OF SCHEDULING CONFLICTS AND A PRIOR NON-RA RELATED INJURY. HOWEVER, THE REMAINING PARTICIPANTS (N=5) COMPLETED BETWEEN 75% AND 100% OF TREATMENT SESSIONS (MEAN=95%). NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED.

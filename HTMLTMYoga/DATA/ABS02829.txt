1 2829 261 YOGA VERSUS STANDARD CARE FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS AN ANCIENT SPIRITUAL PRACTICE THAT ORIGINATED IN INDIA AND IS CURRENTLY ACCEPTED IN THE WESTERN WORLD AS A FORM OF RELAXATION AND EXERCISE. IT HAS BEEN OF INTEREST FOR PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA TO DETERMINE ITS EFFICACY AS AN ADJUNCT TO STANDARD-CARE TREATMENT. OBJECTIVES: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA VERSUS STANDARD CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA. SEARCH METHODS: WE SEARCHED THE COCHRANE SCHIZOPHRENIA GROUP TRIALS REGISTER (NOVEMBER 2012 AND JANUARY 29, 2015), WHICH IS BASED ON REGULAR SEARCHES OF MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PSYCINFO, AND REGISTRIES OF CLINICAL TRIALS. WE SEARCHED THE REFERENCES OF ALL INCLUDED STUDIES. THERE WERE NO LANGUAGE, DATE, DOCUMENT TYPE, OR PUBLICATION STATUS LIMITATIONS FOR INCLUSION OF RECORDS IN THE REGISTER. SELECTION CRITERIA: ALL RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) INCLUDING PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA COMPARING YOGA TO STANDARD-CARE CONTROL. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: THE REVIEW TEAM INDEPENDENTLY SELECTED STUDIES, QUALITY RATED THESE, AND EXTRACTED DATA. FOR BINARY OUTCOMES, WE CALCULATED RISK RATIO (RR) AND ITS 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI), ON AN INTENTION-TO-TREAT BASIS. FOR CONTINUOUS DATA, WE ESTIMATED THE MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) BETWEEN GROUPS AND ITS 95% CI. WE EMPLOYED MIXED-EFFECT AND FIXED-EFFECT MODELS FOR ANALYSES. WE EXAMINED DATA FOR HETEROGENEITY (I(2) TECHNIQUE), ASSESSED RISK OF BIAS FOR INCLUDED STUDIES, AND CREATED 'SUMMARY OF FINDINGS' TABLES USING GRADE (GRADING OF RECOMMENDATIONS ASSESSMENT, DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION). MAIN RESULTS: WE INCLUDED EIGHT STUDIES IN THE REVIEW. ALL OUTCOMES WERE SHORT TERM (LESS THAN SIX MONTHS). THERE WERE CLEAR DIFFERENCES IN A NUMBER OF OUTCOMES IN FAVOUR OF THE YOGA GROUP, ALTHOUGH THESE WERE BASED ON ONE STUDY EACH, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF LEAVING THE STUDY EARLY. THESE INCLUDED MENTAL STATE (IMPROVEMENT IN POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SYNDROME SCALE, 1 RCT, N = 83, RR 0.70 CI 0.55 TO 0.88, MEDIUM-QUALITY EVIDENCE), SOCIAL FUNCTIONING (IMPROVEMENT IN SOCIAL OCCUPATIONAL FUNCTIONING SCALE, 1 RCT, N = 83, RR 0.88 CI 0.77 TO 1, MEDIUM-QUALITY EVIDENCE), QUALITY OF LIFE (AVERAGE CHANGE 36-ITEM SHORT FORM SURVEY (SF-36) QUALITY-OF-LIFE SUBSCALE, 1 RCT, N = 60, MD 15.50, 95% CI 4.27 TO 26.73, LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE), AND LEAVING THE STUDY EARLY (8 RCTS, N = 457, RR 0.91 CI 0.6 TO 1.37, MEDIUM-QUALITY EVIDENCE). FOR THE OUTCOME OF PHYSICAL HEALTH, THERE WAS NOT A CLEAR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS (AVERAGE CHANGE SF-36 PHYSICAL-HEALTH SUBSCALE, 1 RCT, N = 60, MD 6.60, 95% CI -2.44 TO 15.64, LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE). ONLY ONE STUDY REPORTED ADVERSE EFFECTS, FINDING NO INCIDENCE OF ADVERSE EVENTS IN EITHER TREATMENT GROUP. THIS REVIEW WAS SUBJECT TO A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF MISSING OUTCOMES, WHICH INCLUDED GLOBAL STATE, CHANGE IN COGNITION, COSTS OF CARE, EFFECT ON STANDARD CARE, SERVICE INTERVENTION, DISABILITY, AND ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: EVEN THOUGH WE FOUND SOME POSITIVE EVIDENCE IN FAVOUR OF YOGA OVER STANDARD-CARE CONTROL, THIS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED CAUTIOUSLY IN VIEW OF OUTCOMES LARGELY BASED EACH ON ONE STUDY WITH LIMITED SAMPLE SIZES AND SHORT-TERM FOLLOW-UP. OVERALL, MANY OUTCOMES WERE NOT REPORTED AND EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN THIS REVIEW IS OF LOW TO MODERATE QUALITY - -TOO WEAK TO INDICATE THAT YOGA IS SUPERIOR TO STANDARD-CARE CONTROL FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
2 2827 214 YOGA VERSUS NON-STANDARD CARE FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS AN ANCIENT SPIRITUAL PRACTICE THAT ORIGINATED IN INDIA AND IS CURRENTLY ACCEPTED IN THE WESTERN WORLD AS A FORM OF RELAXATION AND EXERCISE. IT HAS BEEN OF INTEREST FOR PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA AS AN ALTERNATIVE OR ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT. OBJECTIVES: TO SYSTEMATICALLY ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA VERSUS NON-STANDARD CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA. SEARCH METHODS: THE INFORMATION SPECIALIST OF THE COCHRANE SCHIZOPHRENIA GROUP SEARCHED THEIR SPECIALISED TRIALS REGISTER (LATEST 30 MARCH 2017), WHICH IS BASED ON REGULAR SEARCHES OF MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PSYCINFO, AND REGISTRIES OF CLINICAL TRIALS. WE SEARCHED THE REFERENCES OF ALL INCLUDED STUDIES. THERE ARE NO LANGUAGE, DATE, DOCUMENT TYPE, OR PUBLICATION STATUS LIMITATIONS FOR INCLUSION OF RECORDS IN THE REGISTER. SELECTION CRITERIA: ALL RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) INCLUDING PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA AND COMPARING YOGA WITH NON-STANDARD CARE. WE INCLUDED TRIALS THAT MET OUR SELECTION CRITERIA AND REPORTED USEABLE DATA. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: THE REVIEW TEAM INDEPENDENTLY SELECTED STUDIES, ASSESSED QUALITY, AND EXTRACTED DATA. FOR BINARY OUTCOMES, WE CALCULATED RISK RATIO (RR) AND ITS 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI), ON AN INTENTION-TO-TREAT BASIS. FOR CONTINUOUS DATA, WE ESTIMATED THE MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) BETWEEN GROUPS AND ITS 95% CI. WE EMPLOYED A FIXED-EFFECT MODELS FOR ANALYSES. WE EXAMINED DATA FOR HETEROGENEITY (I(2) TECHNIQUE), ASSESSED RISK OF BIAS FOR INCLUDED STUDIES, AND CREATED A 'SUMMARY OF FINDINGS' TABLE FOR SEVEN MAIN OUTCOMES OF INTEREST USING GRADE (GRADING OF RECOMMENDATIONS ASSESSMENT, DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION). MAIN RESULTS: WE WERE ABLE TO INCLUDE SIX STUDIES (586 PARTICIPANTS). NON-STANDARD CARE CONSISTED SOLELY OF ANOTHER TYPE OF EXERCISE PROGRAMME. ALL OUTCOMES WERE SHORT TERM (LESS THAN SIX MONTHS). THERE WAS A CLEAR DIFFERENCE IN THE OUTCOME LEAVING THE STUDY EARLY (6 RCTS, N=586, RR 0.64 CI 0.49 TO 0.83, MEDIUM QUALITY EVIDENCE) IN FAVOUR OF THE YOGA GROUP. THERE WERE NO CLEAR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS FOR THE REMAINING OUTCOMES. THESE INCLUDED MENTAL STATE (IMPROVEMENT IN POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SYNDROME SCALE, 1 RCT, N=84, RR 0.81 CI 0.62 TO 1.07, LOW QUALITY EVIDENCE), SOCIAL FUNCTIONING (IMPROVEMENT IN SOCIAL OCCUPATIONAL FUNCTIONING SCALE, 1 RCT, N=84, RR 0.90 CI 0.78 TO 1.04, LOW QUALITY EVIDENCE), QUALITY OF LIFE (MENTAL HEALTH) (AVERAGE CHANGE 36-ITEM SHORT FORM SURVEY (SF-36) QUALITY-OF-LIFE SUB-SCALE, 1 RCT, N=69, MD -5.30 CI -17.78 TO 7.18, LOW QUALITY EVIDENCE), PHYSICAL HEALTH, (AVERAGE CHANGE WHOQOL-BREF PHYSICAL-HEALTH SUB-SCALE, 1 RCT, N=69, MD 9.22 CI -0.42 TO 18.86, LOW QUALITY EVIDENCE). ONLY ONE STUDY REPORTED ADVERSE EFFECTS, FINDING NO INCIDENCE OF ADVERSE EVENTS IN EITHER TREATMENT GROUP. THERE WERE A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF MISSING OUTCOMES, WHICH INCLUDED RELAPSE, CHANGE IN COGNITION, COSTS OF CARE, EFFECT ON STANDARD CARE, SERVICE INTERVENTION, DISABILITY, AND ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: WE FOUND MINIMAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN YOGA AND NON-STANDARD CARE, THE LATTER CONSISTING OF ANOTHER EXERCISE COMPARATOR, WHICH COULD BE BROADLY CONSIDERED AEROBIC EXERCISE. OUTCOMES WERE LARGELY BASED ON SINGLE STUDIES WITH LIMITED SAMPLE SIZES AND SHORT-TERM FOLLOW-UP. OVERALL, MANY OUTCOMES WERE NOT REPORTED AND EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN THIS REVIEW IS OF LOW TO MODERATE QUALITY - TOO WEAK TO INDICATE THAT YOGA IS SUPERIOR OR INFERIOR TO NON-STANDARD CARE CONTROL FOR MANAGEMENT OF PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
3 2497 171 YOGA AS PART OF A PACKAGE OF CARE VERSUS STANDARD CARE FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS AN ANCIENT SPIRITUAL PRACTICE THAT ORIGINATED IN INDIA AND IS CURRENTLY ACCEPTED IN THE WESTERN WORLD AS A FORM OF RELAXATION AND EXERCISE. IT HAS BEEN OF INTEREST FOR PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA DELIVERED AS A PACKAGE OF CARE VERSUS STANDARD CARE. OBJECTIVES: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AS A PACKAGE OF CARE VERSUS STANDARD CARE. SEARCH METHODS: WE SEARCHED THE COCHRANE SCHIZOPHRENIA GROUP TRIALS REGISTER (LATEST 30 MARCH 2017) WHICH IS BASED ON REGULAR SEARCHES OF MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE, CINAHL, BIOSS, AMED, PSYCHINFO, AND REGISTRIES OF CLINICAL TRIALS. WE SEARCHED THE REFERENCES OF ALL INCLUDED STUDIES. THERE ARE NO LANGUAGE, DATE, DOCUMENT TYPE, OR PUBLICATION STATUS LIMITATIONS FOR INCLUSION OF RECORDS IN THE REGISTER. SELECTION CRITERIA: ALL RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) INCLUDING PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA COMPARING YOGA AS A PACKAGE OF CARE WITH STANDARD-CARE CONTROL. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: THE REVIEW AUTHORS INDEPENDENTLY SELECTED STUDIES, QUALITY RATED THESE, AND EXTRACTED DATA. FOR BINARY OUTCOMES, WE CALCULATED RISK DIFFERENCE (RD) AND ITS 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI), ON AN INTENTION-TO-TREAT (ITT) BASIS. FOR CONTINUOUS DATA, WE ESTIMATED THE MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) BETWEEN GROUPS AND ITS CI. WE EMPLOYED MIXED-EFFECT AND FIXED-EFFECT MODELS FOR ANALYSIS. WE EXAMINED HETEROGENEITY (I(2) TECHNIQUE), ASSESSED RISK OF BIAS FOR INCLUDED STUDIES, AND CREATED A 'SUMMARY OF FINDINGS' TABLE USING GRADE (GRADING OF RECOMMENDATIONS ASSESSMENT, DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION). MAIN RESULTS: THREE STUDIES ARE INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW. ALL OUTCOMES WERE SHORT TERM (LESS THAN EIGHT WEEKS). USEABLE DATA WERE REPORTED FOR TWO OUTCOMES ONLY; LEAVING THE STUDY EARLY AND QUALITY OF LIFE. NONE OF THE PARTICIPANTS LEFT THE STUDIES EARLY AND THERE WAS SOME EVIDENCE IN FAVOUR OF THE YOGA PACKAGE FOR QUALITY OF LIFE ENDPOINT SCORES (1 RCT, N=80, MD 22.93 CI 19.74 TO 26.12, LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE). LEAVING THE STUDY EARLY DATA WERE EQUIVOCAL BETWEEN THE TREATMENT GROUPS (3 RCTS, N=193, RD 0.06 CI -0.01 TO 0.13, MEDIUM-QUALITY EVIDENCE, HIGH HETEROGENEITY). OVERALL, THIS REVIEW HAS AN INORDINATE NUMBER OF MISSING KEY OUTCOMES, WHICH INCLUDED MENTAL AND GLOBAL STATE, SOCIAL FUNCTIONING, PHYSICAL HEALTH, ADVERSE EFFECTS AND COSTS OF CARE. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: A SMALL NUMBER OF SMALL STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW AND THESE LACKED MANY KEY OUTCOMES. THE SPARSE DATA MEANS WE CANNOT STATE WITH ANY DEGREE OF CERTAINTY IF YOGA DELIVERED AS A PACKAGE OF CARE IS BENEFICIAL IN COMPARISON TO STANDARD CARE.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
4 2496  96 YOGA AS PART OF A PACKAGE OF CARE VERSUS NON-STANDARD CARE FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS AN ANCIENT BODY-MIND PRACTICE WHICH ORIGINATED IN INDIA AND IS POPULAR IN THE WESTERN WORLD AS A FORM OF RELAXATION AND EXERCISE. IT HAS BEEN OF INTEREST FOR PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA DELIVERED AS A PACKAGE OF CARE VERSUS NON-STANDARD CARE. OBJECTIVES: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AS PART OF A PACKAGE OF CARE VERSUS NON-STANDARD CARE FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA. SEARCH METHODS: WE SEARCHED THE COCHRANE SCHIZOPHRENIA GROUP TRIALS REGISTER (LATEST 15 MAY 2018) WHICH IS BASED ON REGULAR SEARCHES OF MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE, CINAHL, BIOSS, AMED, PSYCHINFO, AND REGISTRIES OF CLINICAL TRIALS. WE SEARCHED THE REFERENCES OF ALL INCLUDED STUDIES. THERE ARE NO LANGUAGE, DATE, DOCUMENT TYPE, OR PUBLICATION STATUS LIMITATIONS FOR INCLUSION OF RECORDS IN THE REGISTER. SELECTION CRITERIA: ALL RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) INCLUDING PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA COMPARING YOGA AS PART OF A PACKAGE OF CARE WITH NON-STANDARD CARE. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: THERE WERE NO DATA TO ANALYSE AS NO STUDIES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. MAIN RESULTS: THE SEARCHES IDENTIFIED 30 STUDIES THAT COULD BE RELEVANT TO THIS REVIEW. AFTER CAREFUL INSPECTION, 29 WERE EXCLUDED AND ONE IS AWAITING CLASSIFICATION. NO DATA WERE AVAILABLE FOR ANALYSES.

5 2543 117 YOGA FOR ASTHMA. BACKGROUND: ASTHMA IS A COMMON CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY DISORDER AFFECTING ABOUT 300 MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE. AS A HOLISTIC THERAPY, YOGA HAS THE POTENTIAL TO RELIEVE BOTH THE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SUFFERING OF PEOPLE WITH ASTHMA, AND ITS POPULARITY HAS EXPANDED GLOBALLY. A NUMBER OF CLINICAL TRIALS HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA PRACTICE, WITH INCONSISTENT RESULTS. OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN PEOPLE WITH ASTHMA. SEARCH METHODS: WE SYSTEMATICALLY SEARCHED THE COCHRANE AIRWAYS GROUP REGISTER OF TRIALS, WHICH IS DERIVED FROM SYSTEMATIC SEARCHES OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATABASES INCLUDING THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, AND PSYCINFO, AND HANDSEARCHING OF RESPIRATORY JOURNALS AND MEETING ABSTRACTS. WE ALSO SEARCHED PEDRO. WE SEARCHED CLINICALTRIALS.GOV AND THE WHO ICTRP SEARCH PORTAL. WE SEARCHED ALL DATABASES FROM THEIR INCEPTION TO 22 JULY 2015, AND USED NO RESTRICTION ON LANGUAGE OF PUBLICATION. WE CHECKED THE REFERENCE LISTS OF ELIGIBLE STUDIES AND RELEVANT REVIEW ARTICLES FOR ADDITIONAL STUDIES. WE ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT INVESTIGATORS OF ELIGIBLE STUDIES AND EXPERTS IN THE FIELD TO LEARN OF OTHER PUBLISHED AND UNPUBLISHED STUDIES. SELECTION CRITERIA: WE INCLUDED RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) THAT COMPARED YOGA WITH USUAL CARE (OR NO INTERVENTION) OR SHAM INTERVENTION IN PEOPLE WITH ASTHMA AND REPORTED AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING OUTCOMES: QUALITY OF LIFE, ASTHMA SYMPTOM SCORE, ASTHMA CONTROL, LUNG FUNCTION MEASURES, ASTHMA MEDICATION USAGE, AND ADVERSE EVENTS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: WE EXTRACTED BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, CHARACTERISTICS OF PARTICIPANTS, CHARACTERISTICS OF INTERVENTIONS AND CONTROLS, CHARACTERISTICS OF METHODOLOGY, AND RESULTS FOR THE OUTCOMES OF OUR INTEREST FROM ELIGIBLE STUDIES. FOR CONTINUOUS OUTCOMES, WE USED MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) WITH 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) TO DENOTE THE TREATMENT EFFECTS, IF THE OUTCOMES WERE MEASURED BY THE SAME SCALE ACROSS STUDIES. ALTERNATIVELY, IF THE OUTCOMES WERE MEASURED BY DIFFERENT SCALES ACROSS STUDIES, WE USED STANDARDISED MEAN DIFFERENCE (SMD) WITH 95% CI. FOR DICHOTOMOUS OUTCOMES, WE USED RISK RATIO (RR) WITH 95% CI TO MEASURE THE TREATMENT EFFECTS. WE PERFORMED META-ANALYSIS WITH REVIEW MANAGER 5.3. WE USED THE FIXED-EFFECT MODEL TO POOL THE DATA, UNLESS THERE WAS SUBSTANTIAL HETEROGENEITY AMONG STUDIES, IN WHICH CASE WE USED THE RANDOM-EFFECTS MODEL INSTEAD. FOR OUTCOMES INAPPROPRIATE OR IMPOSSIBLE TO POOL QUANTITATIVELY, WE CONDUCTED A DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS AND SUMMARISED THE FINDINGS NARRATIVELY. MAIN RESULTS: WE INCLUDED 15 RCTS WITH A TOTAL OF 1048 PARTICIPANTS. MOST OF THE TRIALS WERE CONDUCTED IN INDIA, FOLLOWED BY EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES. THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS WERE ADULTS OF BOTH SEXES WITH MILD TO MODERATE ASTHMA FOR SIX MONTHS TO MORE THAN 23 YEARS. FIVE STUDIES INCLUDED YOGA BREATHING ALONE, WHILE THE OTHER STUDIES ASSESSED YOGA INTERVENTIONS THAT INCLUDED BREATHING, POSTURE, AND MEDITATION. INTERVENTIONS LASTED FROM TWO WEEKS TO 54 MONTHS, FOR NO MORE THAN SIX MONTHS IN THE MAJORITY OF STUDIES. THE RISK OF BIAS WAS LOW ACROSS ALL DOMAINS IN ONE STUDY AND UNCLEAR OR HIGH IN AT LEAST ONE DOMAIN FOR THE REMAINDER.THERE WAS SOME EVIDENCE THAT YOGA MAY IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE (MD IN ASTHMA QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE (AQLQ) SCORE PER ITEM 0.57 UNITS ON A 7-POINT SCALE, 95% CI 0.37 TO 0.77; 5 STUDIES; 375 PARTICIPANTS), IMPROVE SYMPTOMS (SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.09 TO 0.65; 3 STUDIES; 243 PARTICIPANTS), AND REDUCE MEDICATION USAGE (RR 5.35, 95% CI 1.29 TO 22.11; 2 STUDIES) IN PEOPLE WITH ASTHMA. THE MD FOR AQLQ SCORE EXCEEDED THE MINIMAL CLINICALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE (MCID) OF 0.5, BUT WHETHER THE MEAN CHANGES EXCEEDED THE MCID FOR ASTHMA SYMPTOMS IS UNCERTAIN DUE TO THE LACK OF AN ESTABLISHED MCID IN THE SEVERITY SCORES USED IN THE INCLUDED STUDIES. THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CHANGE FROM BASELINE FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN ONE SECOND (MD 0.04 LITRES, 95% CI -0.10 TO 0.19; 7 STUDIES; 340 PARTICIPANTS; I(2) = 68%) WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. TWO STUDIES INDICATED IMPROVED ASTHMA CONTROL, BUT DUE TO VERY SIGNIFICANT HETEROGENEITY (I(2) = 98%) WE DID NOT POOL DATA. NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA WERE REPORTED, BUT THE DATA ON THIS OUTCOME WAS LIMITED. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: WE FOUND MODERATE-QUALITY EVIDENCE THAT YOGA PROBABLY LEADS TO SMALL IMPROVEMENTS IN QUALITY OF LIFE AND SYMPTOMS IN PEOPLE WITH ASTHMA. THERE IS MORE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND ITS IMPACT ON LUNG FUNCTION AND MEDICATION USAGE. RCTS WITH A LARGE SAMPLE SIZE AND HIGH METHODOLOGICAL AND REPORTING QUALITY ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM THE EFFECTS OF YOGA FOR ASTHMA.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
6  232  62 A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF YOGA FOR MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER. BACKGROUND: THE PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN TREATING PATIENTS WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER. METHODS: MEDLINE, SCOPUS, AND THE COCHRANE LIBRARY WERE SCREENED THROUGH DECEMBER 2016. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) COMPARING YOGA TO INACTIVE OR ACTIVE COMPARATORS IN PATIENTS WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER WERE ELIGIBLE. PRIMARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED REMISSION RATES AND SEVERITY OF DEPRESSION. ANXIETY AND ADVERSE EVENTS WERE SECONDARY OUTCOMES. RISK OF BIAS WAS ASSESSED USING THE COCHRANE TOOL. RESULTS: SEVEN RCTS WITH 240 PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED. RISK OF BIAS WAS UNCLEAR FOR MOST RCTS. COMPARED TO AEROBIC EXERCISE, NO SHORT- OR MEDIUM-TERM GROUP DIFFERENCES IN DEPRESSION SEVERITY WAS FOUND. HIGHER SHORT-TERM DEPRESSION SEVERITY WAS FOUND FOR YOGA COMPARED TO ELECTRO-CONVULSIVE THERAPY; REMISSION RATES DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN GROUPS. NO SHORT-TERM GROUP DIFFERENCES OCCURRED WHEN YOGA WAS COMPARED TO ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATION. CONFLICTING EVIDENCE WAS FOUND WHEN YOGA WAS COMPARED TO ATTENTION-CONTROL INTERVENTIONS, OR WHEN YOGA AS AN ADD-ON TO ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATION WAS COMPARED TO MEDICATION ALONE. ONLY TWO RCTS ASSESSED ADVERSE EVENTS AND REPORTED THAT NO TREATMENT-RELATED ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. LIMITATIONS: FEW RCTS WITH LOW SAMPLE SIZE. CONCLUSIONS: THIS REVIEW FOUND SOME EVIDENCE FOR POSITIVE EFFECTS BEYOND PLACEBO AND COMPARABLE EFFECTS COMPARED TO EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS. HOWEVER, METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS AND THE UNCLEAR RISK-BENEFIT RATIO PRECLUDE DEFINITIVE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OR AGAINST YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT TREATMENT FOR MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER. LARGER AND ADEQUATELY POWERED RCTS USING NON-INFERIORITY DESIGNS ARE NEEDED.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
7 2620 116 YOGA FOR STROKE REHABILITATION. BACKGROUND: STROKE IS A MAJOR HEALTH ISSUE AND CAUSE OF LONG-TERM DISABILITY AND HAS A MAJOR EMOTIONAL AND SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACT. THERE IS A NEED TO EXPLORE OPTIONS FOR LONG-TERM SUSTAINABLE INTERVENTIONS THAT SUPPORT STROKE SURVIVORS TO ENGAGE IN MEANINGFUL ACTIVITIES TO ADDRESS LIFE CHALLENGES AFTER STROKE. REHABILITATION FOCUSES ON RECOVERY OF FUNCTION AND COGNITION TO THE MAXIMUM LEVEL ACHIEVABLE, AND MAY INCLUDE A WIDE RANGE OF COMPLEMENTARY STRATEGIES INCLUDING YOGA.YOGA IS A MIND-BODY PRACTICE THAT ORIGINATED IN INDIA, AND WHICH HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY WIDESPREAD IN THE WESTERN WORLD. RECENT EVIDENCE HIGHLIGHTS THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA FOR PEOPLE WITH A RANGE OF PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. A RECENT NON-COCHRANE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW CONCLUDED THAT YOGA CAN BE USED AS SELF-ADMINISTERED PRACTICE IN STROKE REHABILITATION. OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA, AS A STROKE REHABILITATION INTERVENTION, ON RECOVERY OF FUNCTION AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). SEARCH METHODS: WE SEARCHED THE COCHRANE STROKE GROUP TRIALS REGISTER (LAST SEARCHED JULY 2017), COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL) (LAST SEARCHED JULY 2017), MEDLINE (TO JULY 2017), EMBASE (TO JULY 2017), CINAHL (TO JULY 2017), AMED (TO JULY 2017), PSYCINFO (TO JULY 2017), LILACS (TO JULY 2017), SCIELO (TO JULY 2017), INDMED (TO JULY 2017), OTSEEKER (TO JULY 2017) AND PEDRO (TO JULY 2017). WE ALSO SEARCHED FOUR TRIALS REGISTERS, AND ONE CONFERENCE ABSTRACTS DATABASE. WE SCREENED REFERENCE LISTS OF RELEVANT PUBLICATIONS AND CONTACTED AUTHORS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. SELECTION CRITERIA: WE INCLUDED RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) THAT COMPARED YOGA WITH A WAITING-LIST CONTROL OR NO INTERVENTION CONTROL IN STROKE SURVIVORS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: TWO REVIEW AUTHORS INDEPENDENTLY EXTRACTED DATA FROM THE INCLUDED STUDIES. WE PERFORMED ALL ANALYSES USING REVIEW MANAGER (REVMAN). ONE REVIEW AUTHOR ENTERED THE DATA INTO REVMAN; ANOTHER CHECKED THE ENTRIES. WE DISCUSSED DISAGREEMENTS WITH A THIRD REVIEW AUTHOR UNTIL CONSENSUS WAS REACHED. WE USED THE COCHRANE 'RISK OF BIAS' TOOL. WHERE WE CONSIDERED STUDIES TO BE SUFFICIENTLY SIMILAR, WE CONDUCTED A META-ANALYSIS BY POOLING THE APPROPRIATE DATA. FOR OUTCOMES FOR WHICH IT WAS INAPPROPRIATE OR IMPOSSIBLE TO POOL QUANTITATIVELY, WE CONDUCTED A DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS AND PROVIDED A NARRATIVE SUMMARY. MAIN RESULTS: WE INCLUDED TWO RCTS INVOLVING 72 PARTICIPANTS. SIXTY-NINE PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED IN ONE META-ANALYSIS (BALANCE). BOTH TRIALS ASSESSED QOL, ALONG WITH SECONDARY OUTCOMES MEASURES RELATING TO MOVEMENT AND PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES; ONE ALSO MEASURED DISABILITY.IN ONE STUDY THE STROKE IMPACT SCALE WAS USED TO MEASURE QOL ACROSS SIX DOMAINS, AT BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION. THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON FIVE DOMAINS (PHYSICAL, EMOTION, COMMUNICATION, SOCIAL PARTICIPATION, STROKE RECOVERY) WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT; HOWEVER, THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE MEMORY DOMAIN WAS SIGNIFICANT (MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) 15.30, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) 1.29 TO 29.31, P = 0.03), THE EVIDENCE FOR THIS FINDING WAS VERY LOW GRADE. IN THE SECOND STUDY, QOL WAS ASSESSED USING THE STROKE-SPECIFC QOL SCALE; NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT WAS FOUND.SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED MOVEMENT, STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIABLES, PAIN, AND DISABILITY.BALANCE WAS MEASURED IN BOTH STUDIES USING THE BERG BALANCE SCALE; THE EFFECT OF INTERVENTION WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT (MD 2.38, 95% CI -1.41 TO 6.17, P = 0.22). SENSITITIVY ANALYSIS DID NOT ALTER THE DIRECTION OF EFFECT. ONE STUDY MEASURED BALANCE SELF-EFFICACY, USING THE ACTIVITIES-SPECIFIC BALANCE CONFIDENCE SCALE (MD 10.60, 95% CI -7.08,= TO 28.28, P = 0.24); THE EFFECT OF INTERVENTION WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT; THE EVIDENCE FOR THIS FINDING WAS VERY LOW GRADE.ONE STUDY MEASURED GAIT USING THE COMFORTABLE SPEED GAIT TEST (MD 1.32, 95% CI -1.35 TO 3.99, P = 0.33), AND MOTOR FUNCTION USING THE MOTOR ASSESSMENT SCALE (MD -4.00, 95% CI -12.42 TO 4.42, P = 0.35); NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT WAS FOUND BASED ON VERY LOW-GRADE EVIDENCE.ONE STUDY MEASURED DISABILITY USING THE MODIFIED RANKIN SCALE (MRS) BUT REPORTED ONLY WHETHER PARTICIPANTS WERE INDEPENDENT OR DEPENDENT. NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT WAS FOUND: (ODDS RATIO (OR) 2.08, 95% CI 0.50 TO 8.60, P = 0.31); THE EVIDENCE FOR THIS FINDING WAS VERY LOW GRADE.ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION WERE MEASURED IN ONE STUDY. THREE MEASURES WERE USED: THE GERIATRIC DEPRESSION SCALE-SHORT FORM (GCDS15), AND TWO FORMS OF STATE TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY (STAI, FORM Y) TO MEASURE STATE ANXIETY (I.E. ANXIETY EXPERIENCED IN RESPONSE TO STRESSFUL SITUATIONS) AND TRAIT ANXIETY (I.E. ANXIETY ASSOCIATED WITH CHRONIC PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS). NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT WAS FOUND FOR DEPRESSION (GDS15, MD -2.10, 95% CI -4.70 TO 0.50, P = 0.11) OR FOR TRAIT ANXIETY (STAI-Y2, MD -6.70, 95% CI -15.35 TO 1.95, P = 0.13), BASED ON VERY LOW-GRADE EVIDENCE. HOWEVER, A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT WAS FOUND FOR STATE ANXIETY: STAI-Y1 (MD -8.40, 95% CI -16.74 TO -0.06, P = 0.05); THE EVIDENCE FOR THIS FINDING WAS VERY LOW GRADE.NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED.QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCEWE ASSESSED THE QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE USING GRADE. OVERALL, THE QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE WAS VERY LOW, DUE TO THE SMALL NUMBER OF TRIALS INCLUDED IN THE REVIEW BOTH OF WHICH WERE JUDGED TO BE AT HIGH RISK OF BIAS, PARTICULARLY IN RELATION TO INCOMPLETENESS OF DATA AND SELECTIVE REPORTING, AND ESPECIALLY REGARDING THE REPRESENTATIVE NATURE OF THE SAMPLE IN ONE STUDY. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: YOGA HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR BEING INCLUDED AS PART OF PATIENT-CENTRED STROKE REHABILITATION. HOWEVER, THIS REVIEW HAS IDENTIFIED INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO CONFIRM OR REFUTE THE EFFECTIVENESS OR SAFETY OF YOGA AS A STROKE REHABILITATION TREATMENT. FURTHER LARGE-SCALE METHODOLOGICALLY ROBUST TRIALS ARE REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AS A STROKE REHABILITATION TREATMENT.	2017	

8 2330  44 TWELVE WEEKS OF YOGA FOR CHRONIC NONSPECIFIC LOWER BACK PAIN: A META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVES: TO INVESTIGATE THE OVERALL EFFECTS OF 12 WEEKS OF YOGA PRACTICE ON CHRONIC NONSPECIFIC LOWER BACK PAIN. METHODS: PUBMED, EMBASE, PSYCINFO, WEB OF SCIENCE, AND THE COCHRANE LIBRARY DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FROM INCEPTION TO FEBRUARY 9, 2019, AND SIX RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE SELECTED FOR THIS META-ANALYSIS. RESULTS: THE POOLED FIXED-EFFECT SIZE OF SIX TRIALS SHOWED THAT 12 WEEKS OF YOGA PROGRAMS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE CHRONIC NONSPECIFIC LOWER BACK PAIN BY 0.41 WITHIN THE TRIALS (STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL: -0.58 TO -0.23; P < .0001). SUBGROUP ANALYSES ALSO SHOWED THAT SIGNIFICANT PAIN REDUCTION WAS RELATED TO TYPE OF YOGA, LENGTH OF SESSION, STUDY QUALITY, AND TIMING OF PAIN ASSESSMENT. CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS REVEAL THAT 12 WEEKS OF YOGA CAN HELP ALLEVIATE PAIN, AND YOGA PROGRAMS SHOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE SUBGROUP FACTORS TO INCREASE INDIVIDUALS' RELIEF FROM CHRONIC NONSPECIFIC LOWER BACK PAIN.	2020

9 1856  72 RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW. PURPOSE: YOGA IS INCREASINGLY USED AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY TO MANAGE DISEASE AND TREATMENT-RELATED SIDE EFFECTS IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER AND HAS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF STUDIES EXPLORING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW EXAMINES WHETHER YOGA INTERVENTIONS PROVIDE ANY MEASURABLE BENEFIT, BOTH PHYSICALLY AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY, FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER. THE RESULTS WILL INFORM FUTURE RESEARCH IN THIS FIELD AND ADVANCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOGA PROGRAMMES. METHODS: WE PERFORMED ELECTRONIC SEARCHES OF MEDLINE, PSYCHINFO, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, WEB OF SCIENCE AND SCOPUS FOR ARTICLES PUBLISHED UP TO JUNE 2012. ONLY RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) WERE INCLUDED AND METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY RATING SCORES WERE DETERMINED USING THE PEDRO (PHYSIOTHERAPY EVIDENCE DATABASE) SCALE. RESULTS: ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-TWO STUDIES WERE IDENTIFIED THROUGH A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH OF EIGHT ELECTRONIC DATABASES. ONLY PUBLISHED MANUSCRIPTS THAT EMPLOYED A RCT DESIGN WERE INCLUDED (N = 18). THE SAMPLE SIZES FOR THESE STUDIES VARIED WIDELY FROM 18 TO 164 PARTICIPANTS AND THE ASSOCIATED PEDRO SCORES RANGED FROM 1 (POOR) TO 8 (GOOD). ALL 18 STUDIES REPORTED POSITIVE EFFECTS FOR TREATMENT-RELATED SIDE EFFECTS IN FAVOUR OF THE YOGA INTERVENTIONS, WITH THE GREATEST IMPACT ON GLOBAL QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) SCORES AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING. CONCLUSION: RESULTS FROM THE FEW RCTS SUGGEST THERE IS MODERATE TO GOOD EVIDENCE THAT YOGA MAY BE A USEFUL PRACTICE FOR WOMEN RECOVERING FROM BREAST CANCER TREATMENTS. LARGE-SCALE RCTS USING OBJECTIVE MEASURES AND PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES WITH LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP ARE NEEDED TO SUBSTANTIATE WHETHER THE BENEFITS ARE TRUE AND SUSTAINABLE.	2012

STUDY SELECTION: A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH OF THE OVID MEDLINE, EMBASE, PSYCINFO, AND COCHRANE DATABASES WAS CONDUCTED FOR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS OF EXERCISE, YOGA, AND TAI CHI FOR MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER. DATA EXTRACTION: STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCES WERE CALCULATED AND META-ANALYZED USING A RANDOM EFFECTS MULTILEVEL MODELING FRAMEWORK. HETEROGENEITY AND SUBGROUP ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED. RESULTS: TWENTY-FIVE STUDIES WERE INCLUDED FOR FINAL ANALYSIS (EXERCISE: 15, YOGA: 7, TAI CHI: 3). OVERALL, META-ANALYSIS SHOWED A MODERATE SIGNIFICANT CLINICAL EFFECT. HOWEVER, WHEN ONLY STUDIES (6 STUDIES) WITH THE LOWEST RISK OF BIAS WERE INCLUDED, THE OVERALL EFFECT SIZE WAS REDUCED TO LOW TO MODERATE EFFICACY. OVERALL QUALITY OF EVIDENCE WAS LOW. HETEROGENEITY AND PUBLICATION BIAS WERE HIGH. CONCLUSIONS: THE CURRENT META-ANALYSIS OF OUTPATIENT EXERCISE, YOGA, AND TAI CHI FOR TREATMENT OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER SUGGESTS THAT ADJUNCTIVE EXERCISE AND YOGA MAY HAVE SMALL ADDITIVE CLINICAL EFFECTS IN COMPARISON TO CONTROL FOR REDUCING DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. THE EVIDENCE FOR TAI CHI IS INSUFFICIENT TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS. THE CONCERNS WITH QUALITY OF STUDIES, HIGH HETEROGENEITY, AND EVIDENCE OF PUBLICATION BIAS PRECLUDE MAKING FIRM CONCLUSIONS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
11 2540  62 YOGA FOR ANXIETY: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. YOGA HAS BECOME A POPULAR APPROACH TO IMPROVE EMOTIONAL HEALTH. THE AIM OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO SYSTEMATICALLY ASSESS AND META-ANALYZE THE EFFECTIVENESS AND SAFETY OF YOGA FOR ANXIETY. MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, PSYCINFO, AND INDMED WERE SEARCHED THROUGH OCTOBER 2016 FOR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) OF YOGA FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH ANXIETY DISORDERS OR ELEVATED LEVELS OF ANXIETY. THE PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE ANXIETY AND REMISSION RATES, AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE DEPRESSION, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND SAFETY. RISK OF BIAS WAS ASSESSED USING THE COCHRANE TOOL. EIGHT RCTS WITH 319 PARTICIPANTS (MEAN AGE: 30.0-38.5 YEARS) WERE INCLUDED. RISK OF SELECTION BIAS WAS UNCLEAR FOR MOST RCTS. META-ANALYSES REVEALED EVIDENCE FOR SMALL SHORT-TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA ON ANXIETY COMPARED TO NO TREATMENT (STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE [SMD] = -0.43; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI] = -0.74, -0.11; P = .008), AND LARGE EFFECTS COMPARED TO ACTIVE COMPARATORS (SMD = -0.86; 95% CI = -1.56, -0.15; P = .02). SMALL EFFECTS ON DEPRESSION WERE FOUND COMPARED TO NO TREATMENT (SMD = -0.35; 95% CI = -0.66, -0.04; P = .03). EFFECTS WERE ROBUST AGAINST POTENTIAL METHODOLOGICAL BIAS. NO EFFECTS WERE FOUND FOR PATIENTS WITH ANXIETY DISORDERS DIAGNOSED BY DIAGNOSTIC AND STATISTICAL MANUAL CRITERIA, ONLY FOR PATIENTS DIAGNOSED BY OTHER METHODS, AND FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH ELEVATED LEVELS OF ANXIETY WITHOUT A FORMAL DIAGNOSIS. ONLY THREE RCTS REPORTED SAFETY-RELATED DATA BUT THESE INDICATED THAT YOGA WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED INJURIES. IN CONCLUSION, YOGA MIGHT BE AN EFFECTIVE AND SAFE INTERVENTION FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH ELEVATED LEVELS OF ANXIETY. THERE WAS INCONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE FOR EFFECTS OF YOGA IN ANXIETY DISORDERS. MORE HIGH-QUALITY STUDIES ARE NEEDED AND ARE WARRANTED GIVEN THESE PRELIMINARY FINDINGS AND PLAUSIBLE MECHANISMS OF ACTION.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
12 2636 114 YOGA FOR TREATING URINARY INCONTINENCE IN WOMEN. BACKGROUND: URINARY INCONTINENCE IN WOMEN IS ASSOCIATED WITH POOR QUALITY OF LIFE AND DIFFICULTIES IN SOCIAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SEXUAL FUNCTIONING. THE CONDITION MAY AFFECT UP TO 15% OF MIDDLE-AGED OR OLDER WOMEN IN THE GENERAL POPULATION. CONSERVATIVE TREATMENTS SUCH AS LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS, BLADDER TRAINING AND PELVIC FLOOR MUSCLE TRAINING (USED EITHER ALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER INTERVENTIONS) ARE THE INITIAL APPROACHES TO THE MANAGEMENT OF URINARY INCONTINENCE. MANY WOMEN ARE INTERESTED IN ADDITIONAL TREATMENTS SUCH AS YOGA, A SYSTEM OF PHILOSOPHY, LIFESTYLE AND PHYSICAL PRACTICE THAT ORIGINATED IN ANCIENT INDIA. OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA FOR TREATING URINARY INCONTINENCE IN WOMEN. SEARCH METHODS: WE SEARCHED THE COCHRANE INCONTINENCE AND COCHRANE COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE SPECIALISED REGISTERS. WE SEARCHED THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION INTERNATIONAL CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRY PLATFORM (WHO ICTRP) AND CLINICALTRIALS.GOV TO IDENTIFY ANY ONGOING OR UNPUBLISHED STUDIES. WE HANDSEARCHED PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE RESEARCH AND THE EUROPEAN CONGRESS FOR INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE. WE SEARCHED THE NHS ECONOMIC EVALUATION DATABASE FOR ECONOMIC STUDIES, AND SUPPLEMENTED THIS SEARCH WITH SEARCHES FOR ECONOMICS STUDIES IN MEDLINE AND EMBASE FROM 2015 ONWARDS. DATABASE SEARCHES ARE UP-TO-DATE AS OF 21 JUNE 2018. SELECTION CRITERIA: RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS IN WOMEN DIAGNOSED WITH URINARY INCONTINENCE IN WHICH ONE GROUP WAS ALLOCATED TO TREATMENT WITH YOGA. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: TWO REVIEW AUTHORS INDEPENDENTLY SCREENED TITLES AND ABSTRACTS OF ALL RETRIEVED ARTICLES, SELECTED STUDIES FOR INCLUSION, EXTRACTED DATA, ASSESSED RISK OF BIAS AND EVALUATED THE CERTAINTY OF THE EVIDENCE FOR EACH REPORTED OUTCOME. ANY DISAGREEMENTS WERE RESOLVED BY CONSENSUS. WE PLANNED TO COMBINE CLINICALLY COMPARABLE STUDIES IN REVIEW MANAGER 5 USING RANDOM-EFFECTS META-ANALYSIS AND TO CARRY OUT SENSITIVITY AND SUBGROUP ANALYSES. WE PLANNED TO CREATE A TABLE LISTING ECONOMIC STUDIES ON YOGA FOR INCONTINENCE BUT NOT CARRY OUT ANY ANALYSES ON THESE STUDIES. MAIN RESULTS: WE INCLUDED TWO STUDIES (INVOLVING A TOTAL OF 49 WOMEN). EACH STUDY COMPARED YOGA TO A DIFFERENT COMPARATOR, THEREFORE WE WERE UNABLE TO COMBINE THE DATA IN A META-ANALYSIS. A THIRD STUDY THAT HAS BEEN COMPLETED BUT NOT YET FULLY REPORTED IS AWAITING ASSESSMENT.ONE INCLUDED STUDY WAS A SIX-WEEK STUDY COMPARING YOGA TO A WAITING LIST IN 19 WOMEN WITH EITHER URGENCY URINARY INCONTINENCE OR STRESS URINARY INCONTINENCE. WE JUDGED THE CERTAINTY OF THE EVIDENCE FOR ALL REPORTED OUTCOMES AS VERY LOW DUE TO PERFORMANCE BIAS, DETECTION BIAS, AND IMPRECISION. THE NUMBER OF WOMEN REPORTING CURE WAS NOT REPORTED. WE ARE UNCERTAIN WHETHER YOGA RESULTS IN SATISFACTION WITH CURE OR IMPROVEMENT OF INCONTINENCE (RISK RATIO (RR) 6.33, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) 1.44 TO 27.88; AN INCREASE OF 592 FROM 111 PER 1000, 95% CI 160 TO 1000). WE ARE UNCERTAIN WHETHER THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOGA AND WAITING LIST IN CONDITION-SPECIFIC QUALITY OF LIFE AS MEASURED ON THE INCONTINENCE IMPACT QUESTIONNAIRE SHORT FORM (MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) 1.74, 95% CI -33.02 TO 36.50); THE NUMBER OF MICTURITIONS (MD -0.77, 95% CI -2.13 TO 0.59); THE NUMBER OF INCONTINENCE EPISODES (MD -1.57, 95% CI -2.83 TO -0.31); OR THE BOTHERSOMENESS OF INCONTINENCE AS MEASURED ON THE UROGENITAL DISTRESS INVENTORY 6 (MD -0.90, 95% CI -1.46 TO -0.34). THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A DIFFERENCE IN THE NUMBER OF WOMEN WHO EXPERIENCED AT LEAST ONE ADVERSE EVENT (RISK DIFFERENCE 0%, 95% CI -38% TO 38%; NO DIFFERENCE FROM 222 PER 1000, 95% CI 380 FEWER TO 380 MORE).THE SECOND INCLUDED STUDY WAS AN EIGHT-WEEK STUDY IN 30 WOMEN WITH URGENCY URINARY INCONTINENCE THAT COMPARED MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION (MBSR) TO AN ACTIVE CONTROL INTERVENTION OF YOGA CLASSES. THE STUDY WAS UNBLINDED, AND THERE WAS HIGH ATTRITION FROM BOTH STUDY ARMS FOR ALL OUTCOME ASSESSMENTS. WE JUDGED THE CERTAINTY OF THE EVIDENCE FOR ALL REPORTED OUTCOMES AS VERY LOW DUE TO PERFORMANCE BIAS, ATTRITION BIAS, IMPRECISION AND INDIRECTNESS. THE NUMBER OF WOMEN REPORTING CURE WAS NOT REPORTED. WE ARE UNCERTAIN WHETHER WOMEN IN THE YOGA GROUP WERE LESS LIKELY TO REPORT IMPROVEMENT IN INCONTINENCE AT EIGHT WEEKS COMPARED TO WOMEN IN THE MBSR GROUP (RR 0.09, 95% CI 0.01 TO 1.43; A DECREASE OF 419 FROM 461 PER 1000, 95% CI 5 TO 660). WE ARE UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE EFFECT OF MBSR COMPARED TO YOGA ON REPORTS OF CURE OR IMPROVEMENT IN INCONTINENCE, IMPROVEMENT IN CONDITION-SPECIFIC QUALITY OF LIFE MEASURED ON THE OVERACTIVE BLADDER HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE SCALE, REDUCTION IN INCONTINENCE EPISODES OR REDUCTION IN BOTHERSOMENESS OF INCONTINENCE AS MEASURED ON THE OVERACTIVE BLADDER SYMPTOM AND QUALITY OF LIFE-SHORT FORM AT EIGHT WEEKS. THE STUDY DID NOT REPORT ON ADVERSE EFFECTS. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: WE IDENTIFIED FEW TRIALS ON YOGA FOR INCONTINENCE, AND THE EXISTING TRIALS WERE SMALL AND AT HIGH RISK OF BIAS. IN ADDITION, WE DID NOT FIND ANY STUDIES OF ECONOMIC OUTCOMES RELATED TO YOGA FOR URINARY INCONTINENCE. DUE TO THE LACK OF EVIDENCE TO ANSWER THE REVIEW QUESTION, WE ARE UNCERTAIN WHETHER YOGA IS USEFUL FOR WOMEN WITH URINARY INCONTINENCE. ADDITIONAL, WELL-CONDUCTED TRIALS WITH LARGER SAMPLE SIZES ARE NEEDED.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
13 2629 108 YOGA FOR THE PRIMARY PREVENTION OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. BACKGROUND: A SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE AND STRESS ARE MAJOR RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (CVD). SINCE YOGA INVOLVES EXERCISE AND IS THOUGHT TO HELP IN STRESS REDUCTION IT MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY IN THE PRIMARY PREVENTION OF CVD. OBJECTIVES: TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF ANY TYPE OF YOGA ON THE PRIMARY PREVENTION OF CVD. SEARCH METHODS: WE SEARCHED THE FOLLOWING ELECTRONIC DATABASES: THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL) (2013, ISSUE 11) IN THE COCHRANE LIBRARY; MEDLINE (OVID) (1946 TO NOVEMBER WEEK 3 2013); EMBASE CLASSIC + EMBASE (OVID) (1947 TO 2013 WEEK 48); WEB OF SCIENCE (THOMSON REUTERS) (1970 TO 4 DECEMBER 2013); DATABASE OF ABSTRACTS OF REVIEWS OF EFFECTS (DARE), HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT DATABASE AND HEALTH ECONOMICS EVALUATIONS DATABASE (ISSUE 4 OF 4, 2013) IN THE COCHRANE LIBRARY. WE ALSO SEARCHED A NUMBER OF ASIAN DATABASES AND THE ALLIED AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE DATABASE (AMED) (INCEPTION TO DECEMBER 2012). WE SEARCHED TRIAL REGISTERS AND REFERENCE LISTS OF REVIEWS AND ARTICLES, AND APPROACHED EXPERTS IN THE FIELD. WE APPLIED NO LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS. SELECTION CRITERIA: RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS LASTING AT LEAST THREE MONTHS INVOLVING HEALTHY ADULTS OR THOSE AT HIGH RISK OF CVD. TRIALS EXAMINED ANY TYPE OF YOGA AND THE COMPARISON GROUP WAS NO INTERVENTION OR MINIMAL INTERVENTION. OUTCOMES OF INTEREST WERE CLINICAL CVD EVENTS AND MAJOR CVD RISK FACTORS. WE DID NOT INCLUDE ANY TRIALS THAT INVOLVED MULTIFACTORIAL LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS OR WEIGHT LOSS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: TWO AUTHORS INDEPENDENTLY SELECTED TRIALS FOR INCLUSION, EXTRACTED DATA AND ASSESSED THE RISK OF BIAS. MAIN RESULTS: WE IDENTIFIED 11 TRIALS (800 PARTICIPANTS) AND TWO ONGOING STUDIES. STYLE AND DURATION OF YOGA DIFFERED BETWEEN TRIALS. HALF OF THE PARTICIPANTS RECRUITED TO THE STUDIES WERE AT HIGH RISK OF CVD. MOST OF STUDIES WERE AT RISK OF PERFORMANCE BIAS, WITH INADEQUATE DETAILS REPORTED IN MANY OF THEM TO JUDGE THE RISK OF SELECTION BIAS.NO STUDY REPORTED CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY, ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY OR NON-FATAL EVENTS, AND MOST STUDIES WERE SMALL AND SHORT-TERM. THERE WAS SUBSTANTIAL HETEROGENEITY BETWEEN STUDIES MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO COMBINE STUDIES STATISTICALLY FOR SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND TOTAL CHOLESTEROL. YOGA WAS FOUND TO PRODUCE REDUCTIONS IN DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) -2.90 MMHG, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) -4.52 TO -1.28), WHICH WAS STABLE ON SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, TRIGLYCERIDES (MD -0.27 MMOL/L, 95% CI -0.44 TO -0.11) AND HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (HDL) CHOLESTEROL (MD 0.08 MMOL/L, 95% CI 0.02 TO 0.14). HOWEVER, THE CONTRIBUTING STUDIES WERE SMALL, SHORT-TERM AND AT UNCLEAR OR HIGH RISK OF BIAS. THERE WAS NO CLEAR EVIDENCE OF A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS FOR LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (LDL) CHOLESTEROL (MD -0.09 MMOL/L, 95% CI -0.48 TO 0.30), ALTHOUGH THERE WAS MODERATE STATISTICAL HETEROGENEITY. ADVERSE EVENTS, OCCURRENCE OF TYPE 2 DIABETES AND COSTS WERE NOT REPORTED IN ANY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES. QUALITY OF LIFE WAS MEASURED IN THREE TRIALS BUT THE RESULTS WERE INCONCLUSIVE. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: THE LIMITED EVIDENCE COMES FROM SMALL, SHORT-TERM, LOW-QUALITY STUDIES. THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT YOGA HAS FAVOURABLE EFFECTS ON DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE, HDL CHOLESTEROL AND TRIGLYCERIDES, AND UNCERTAIN EFFECTS ON LDL CHOLESTEROL. THESE RESULTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS EXPLORATORY AND INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
14 2583  64 YOGA FOR HEART RATE VARIABILITY: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW IS TO SUMMARIZE AND CRITICALLY ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV). NINE DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FROM THEIR INCEPTIONS TO JUNE 2014. WE INCLUDED RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS (RCTS) COMPARING YOGA AGAINST ANY TYPE OF CONTROL INTERVENTION IN HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS OR PATIENTS WITH ANY MEDICAL CONDITION. RISK OF BIAS WAS ASSESSED USING THE COCHRANE CRITERIA. TWO REVIEWERS PERFORMED THE SELECTION OF STUDIES, DATA EXTRACTION, AND QUALITY ASSESSMENTS INDEPENDENT OF ONE ANOTHER. FOURTEEN TRIALS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. ONLY TWO OF THEM WERE OF ACCEPTABLE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY. TEN RCTS REPORTED FAVOURABLE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON VARIOUS DOMAINS OF HRV, WHEREAS NINE OF THEM FAILED TO DO SO. ONE RCT DID NOT REPORT BETWEEN-GROUP COMPARISONS. THE META-ANALYSIS (MA) OF TWO TRIALS DID NOT SHOW FAVOURABLE EFFECTS OF YOGA COMPARED TO USUAL CARE ON E:I RATIO (N = 61, SMDS = 0.63; 95% CIS [-0.72 TO 1.99], P = 0.36; HETEROGENEITY: R(2) = 0.79, CHI(2) = 5.48, DF = 1, (P = 0.02); I(2) = 82%). THE MA ALSO FAILED TO SHOW STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GROUPS REGARDING THE 30:15 RATIO (N = 61, SMDS = 0.20; 95% CIS [-0.43 TO 0.84], P = 0.53; HETEROGENEITY: R(2) = 0.07, CHI(2) = 1.45, DF = 1, (P = 0.23); I(2) = 31%). THE DATA FROM THE REMAINING RCTS WERE TOO HETEROGENEOUS FOR POOLING. THESE RESULTS PROVIDE NO CONVINCING EVIDENCE FOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN MODULATING HRV IN PATIENTS OR HEALTHY SUBJECTS. FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS IN THIS AREA SHOULD OVERCOME THE MULTIPLE METHODOLOGICAL WEAKNESSES OF THE PREVIOUS RESEARCH.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
15 2587 113 YOGA FOR IMPROVING HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, MENTAL HEALTH AND CANCER-RELATED SYMPTOMS IN WOMEN DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER. BACKGROUND: BREAST CANCER IS THE CANCER MOST FREQUENTLY DIAGNOSED IN WOMEN WORLDWIDE. EVEN THOUGH SURVIVAL RATES ARE CONTINUALLY INCREASING, BREAST CANCER IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH LONG-TERM PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, CHRONIC PAIN, FATIGUE AND IMPAIRED QUALITY OF LIFE. YOGA COMPRISES ADVICE FOR AN ETHICAL LIFESTYLE, SPIRITUAL PRACTICE, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, BREATHING EXERCISES AND MEDITATION. IT IS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY THAT IS COMMONLY RECOMMENDED FOR BREAST CANCER-RELATED IMPAIRMENTS AND HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH IN PEOPLE WITH DIFFERENT CANCER TYPES. OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS EFFECTS OF YOGA ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, MENTAL HEALTH AND CANCER-RELATED SYMPTOMS AMONG WOMEN WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER WHO ARE RECEIVING ACTIVE TREATMENT OR HAVE COMPLETED TREATMENT. SEARCH METHODS: WE SEARCHED THE COCHRANE BREAST CANCER SPECIALISED REGISTER, MEDLINE (VIA PUBMED), EMBASE, THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL; 2016, ISSUE 1), INDEXING OF INDIAN MEDICAL JOURNALS (INDMED), THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO) INTERNATIONAL CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRY PLATFORM (ICTRP) SEARCH PORTAL AND CLINICALTRIALS.GOV ON 29 JANUARY 2016. WE ALSO SEARCHED REFERENCE LISTS OF IDENTIFIED RELEVANT TRIALS OR REVIEWS, AS WELL AS CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS OF THE INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE RESEARCH (ICCMR), THE EUROPEAN CONGRESS FOR INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE (ECIM) AND THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY (ASCO). WE APPLIED NO LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS. SELECTION CRITERIA: RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE ELIGIBLE WHEN THEY (1) COMPARED YOGA INTERVENTIONS VERSUS NO THERAPY OR VERSUS ANY OTHER ACTIVE THERAPY IN WOMEN WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF NON-METASTATIC OR METASTATIC BREAST CANCER, AND (2) ASSESSED AT LEAST ONE OF THE PRIMARY OUTCOMES ON PATIENT-REPORTED INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, FATIGUE OR SLEEP DISTURBANCES. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: TWO REVIEW AUTHORS INDEPENDENTLY COLLECTED DATA ON METHODS AND RESULTS. WE EXPRESSED OUTCOMES AS STANDARDISED MEAN DIFFERENCES (SMDS) WITH 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CIS) AND CONDUCTED RANDOM-EFFECTS MODEL META-ANALYSES. WE ASSESSED POTENTIAL RISK OF PUBLICATION BIAS THROUGH VISUAL ANALYSIS OF FUNNEL PLOT SYMMETRY AND HETEROGENEITY BETWEEN STUDIES BY USING THE CHI(2) TEST AND THE I(2) STATISTIC. WE CONDUCTED SUBGROUP ANALYSES FOR CURRENT TREATMENT STATUS, TIME SINCE DIAGNOSIS, STAGE OF CANCER AND TYPE OF YOGA INTERVENTION. MAIN RESULTS: WE INCLUDED 24 STUDIES WITH A TOTAL OF 2166 PARTICIPANTS, 23 OF WHICH PROVIDED DATA FOR META-ANALYSIS. THIRTEEN STUDIES HAD LOW RISK OF SELECTION BIAS, FIVE STUDIES REPORTED ADEQUATE BLINDING OF OUTCOME ASSESSMENT AND 15 STUDIES HAD LOW RISK OF ATTRITION BIAS.SEVENTEEN STUDIES THAT COMPARED YOGA VERSUS NO THERAPY PROVIDED MODERATE-QUALITY EVIDENCE SHOWING THAT YOGA IMPROVED HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (POOLED SMD 0.22, 95% CI 0.04 TO 0.40; 10 STUDIES, 675 PARTICIPANTS), REDUCED FATIGUE (POOLED SMD -0.48, 95% CI -0.75 TO -0.20; 11 STUDIES, 883 PARTICIPANTS) AND REDUCED SLEEP DISTURBANCES IN THE SHORT TERM (POOLED SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.40 TO -0.09; SIX STUDIES, 657 PARTICIPANTS). THE FUNNEL PLOT FOR HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE WAS ASYMMETRICAL, FAVOURING NO THERAPY, AND THE FUNNEL PLOT FOR FATIGUE WAS ROUGHLY SYMMETRICAL. THIS HINTS AT OVERALL LOW RISK OF PUBLICATION BIAS. YOGA DID NOT APPEAR TO REDUCE DEPRESSION (POOLED SMD -0.13, 95% CI -0.31 TO 0.05; SEVEN STUDIES, 496 PARTICIPANTS; LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE) OR ANXIETY (POOLED SMD -0.53, 95% CI -1.10 TO 0.04; SIX STUDIES, 346 PARTICIPANTS; VERY LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE) IN THE SHORT TERM AND HAD NO MEDIUM-TERM EFFECTS ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (POOLED SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.23 TO 0.42; TWO STUDIES, 146 PARTICIPANTS; LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE) OR FATIGUE (POOLED SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.36 TO 0.29; TWO STUDIES, 146 PARTICIPANTS; LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE). INVESTIGATORS REPORTED NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS.FOUR STUDIES THAT COMPARED YOGA VERSUS PSYCHOSOCIAL/EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS PROVIDED MODERATE-QUALITY EVIDENCE INDICATING THAT YOGA CAN REDUCE DEPRESSION (POOLED SMD -2.29, 95% CI -3.97 TO -0.61; FOUR STUDIES, 226 PARTICIPANTS), ANXIETY (POOLED SMD -2.21, 95% CI -3.90 TO -0.52; THREE STUDIES, 195 PARTICIPANTS) AND FATIGUE (POOLED SMD -0.90, 95% CI -1.31 TO -0.50; TWO STUDIES, 106 PARTICIPANTS) IN THE SHORT TERM. VERY LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE SHOWED NO SHORT-TERM EFFECTS ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (POOLED SMD 0.81, 95% CI -0.50 TO 2.12; TWO STUDIES, 153 PARTICIPANTS) OR SLEEP DISTURBANCES (POOLED SMD -0.21, 95% CI -0.76 TO 0.34; TWO STUDIES, 119 PARTICIPANTS). NO TRIAL ADEQUATELY REPORTED SAFETY-RELATED DATA.THREE STUDIES THAT COMPARED YOGA VERSUS EXERCISE PRESENTED VERY LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE SHOWING NO SHORT-TERM EFFECTS ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (POOLED SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.30 TO 0.23; THREE STUDIES, 233 PARTICIPANTS) OR FATIGUE (POOLED SMD -0.21, 95% CI -0.66 TO 0.25; THREE STUDIES, 233 PARTICIPANTS); NO TRIAL PROVIDED SAFETY-RELATED DATA. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: MODERATE-QUALITY EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE RECOMMENDATION OF YOGA AS A SUPPORTIVE INTERVENTION FOR IMPROVING HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE AND REDUCING FATIGUE AND SLEEP DISTURBANCES WHEN COMPARED WITH NO THERAPY, AS WELL AS FOR REDUCING DEPRESSION, ANXIETY AND FATIGUE, WHEN COMPARED WITH PSYCHOSOCIAL/EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTIONS. VERY LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT YOGA MIGHT BE AS EFFECTIVE AS OTHER EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS AND MIGHT BE USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO OTHER EXERCISE PROGRAMMES.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
16 2165  75 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA COMPARED TO ACTIVE AND INACTIVE CONTROLS ON PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN OLDER ADULTS- SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS. BACKGROUND: YOGA HAS BEEN RECOMMENDED AS A MUSCLE STRENGTHENING AND BALANCE ACTIVITY IN NATIONAL AND GLOBAL PHYSICAL ACTIVITY GUIDELINES. HOWEVER, THE EVIDENCE BASE ESTABLISHING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN IMPROVING PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) IN AN OLDER ADULT POPULATION NOT RECRUITED ON THE BASIS OF ANY SPECIFIC DISEASE OR CONDITION, HAS NOT BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEWED. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO SYNTHESISE EXISTING EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND HRQOL IN OLDER ADULTS NOT CHARACTERISED BY ANY SPECIFIC CLINICAL CONDITION. METHODS: THE FOLLOWING DATABASES WERE SYSTEMATICALLY SEARCHED IN SEPTEMBER 2017: MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, CINAHL PLUS, SCOPUS, WEB OF SCIENCE, COCHRANE LIBRARY, EMBASE, SPORTDISCUS, AMED AND PROQUEST DISSERTATIONS & THESES GLOBAL. STUDY INCLUSION CRITERIA: OLDER ADULT PARTICIPANTS WITH MEAN AGE OF 60 YEARS AND ABOVE, NOT RECRUITED ON THE BASIS OF ANY SPECIFIC DISEASE OR CONDITION; YOGA INTERVENTION COMPARED WITH INACTIVE CONTROLS (EXAMPLE: WAIT-LIST CONTROL, EDUCATION BOOKLETS) OR ACTIVE CONTROLS (EXAMPLE: WALKING, CHAIR AEROBICS); PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND HRQOL OUTCOMES; AND RANDOMISED/CLUSTER RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH. A VOTE COUNTING ANALYSIS AND META-ANALYSIS WITH STANDARDISED EFFECT SIZES (HEDGES' G) COMPUTED USING RANDOM EFFECTS MODELS WERE CONDUCTED. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 27 RECORDS FROM 22 RCTS WERE INCLUDED (17 RCTS ASSESSED PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND 20 ASSESSED HRQOL). THE META-ANALYSIS REVEALED SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS (5% LEVEL OF SIGNIFICANCE) FAVOURING THE YOGA GROUP FOR THE FOLLOWING PHYSICAL FUNCTION OUTCOMES COMPARED WITH INACTIVE CONTROLS: BALANCE (EFFECT SIZE (ES) = 0.7), LOWER BODY FLEXIBILITY (ES = 0.5), LOWER LIMB STRENGTH (ES = 0.45); COMPARED WITH ACTIVE CONTROLS: LOWER LIMB STRENGTH (ES = 0.49), LOWER BODY FLEXIBILITY (ES = 0.28). FOR HRQOL, SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS FAVOURING YOGA WERE FOUND COMPARED TO INACTIVE CONTROLS FOR: DEPRESSION (ES = 0.64), PERCEIVED MENTAL HEALTH (ES = 0.6), PERCEIVED PHYSICAL HEALTH (ES = 0.61), SLEEP QUALITY (ES = 0.65), AND VITALITY (ES = 0.31); COMPARED TO ACTIVE CONTROLS: DEPRESSION (ES = 0.54). CONCLUSION: THIS REVIEW IS THE FIRST TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA WITH ACTIVE AND INACTIVE CONTROLS IN OLDER ADULTS NOT CHARACTERISED BY A SPECIFIC CLINICAL CONDITION. RESULTS INDICATE THAT YOGA INTERVENTIONS IMPROVE MULTIPLE PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND HRQOL OUTCOMES IN THIS POPULATION COMPARED TO BOTH CONTROL CONDITIONS. THIS STUDY PROVIDES ROBUST EVIDENCE FOR PROMOTING YOGA IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY GUIDELINES FOR OLDER ADULTS AS A MULTIMODAL ACTIVITY THAT IMPROVES ASPECTS OF FITNESS LIKE STRENGTH, BALANCE AND FLEXIBILITY, AS WELL AS MENTAL WELLBEING.

17 2859  62 YOGA-BASED EXERCISE IMPROVES BALANCE AND MOBILITY IN PEOPLE AGED 60 AND OVER: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVE: ONE-THIRD OF COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS FALL ANNUALLY. EXERCISE THAT CHALLENGES BALANCE IS PROVEN TO PREVENT FALLS. WE CONDUCTED A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WITH META-ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF YOGA-BASED EXERCISE ON BALANCE AND PHYSICAL MOBILITY IN PEOPLE AGED 60+ YEARS. METHODS: SEARCHES FOR RELEVANT TRIALS WERE CONDUCTED ON THE FOLLOWING ELECTRONIC DATABASES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS, CINAHL, ALLIED AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE DATABASE AND THE PHYSIOTHERAPY EVIDENCE DATABASE (PEDRO) FROM INCEPTION TO FEBRUARY 2015. TRIALS WERE INCLUDED IF THEY EVALUATED THE EFFECT OF PHYSICAL YOGA (EXCLUDING MEDITATION AND BREATHING EXERCISES ALONE) ON BALANCE IN PEOPLE AGED 60+ YEARS. WE EXTRACTED DATA ON BALANCE AND THE SECONDARY OUTCOME OF PHYSICAL MOBILITY. STANDARDISED MEAN DIFFERENCES AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CI) WERE CALCULATED USING RANDOM-EFFECTS MODELS. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF TRIALS WAS ASSESSED USING THE 10-POINT PHYSIOTHERAPY EVIDENCE DATABASE (PEDRO) SCALE. RESULTS: SIX TRIALS OF RELATIVELY HIGH METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY, TOTALLING 307 PARTICIPANTS, WERE IDENTIFIED AND HAD DATA THAT COULD BE INCLUDED IN A META-ANALYSIS. OVERALL, YOGA INTERVENTIONS HAD A SMALL EFFECT ON BALANCE PERFORMANCE (HEDGES' G = 0.40, 95% CI 0.15-0.65, 6 TRIALS) AND A MEDIUM EFFECT ON PHYSICAL MOBILITY (HEDGES' G = 0.50, 95% CI 0.06-0.95, 3 TRIALS). CONCLUSION: YOGA INTERVENTIONS RESULTED IN SMALL IMPROVEMENTS IN BALANCE AND MEDIUM IMPROVEMENTS IN PHYSICAL MOBILITY IN PEOPLE AGED 60+ YEARS. FURTHER RESEARCH IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOGA-RELATED IMPROVEMENTS IN BALANCE AND MOBILITY TRANSLATE TO PREVENTION OF FALLS IN OLDER PEOPLE.

18 2742  67 YOGA PRACTICE FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE II DIABETES MELLITUS IN ADULTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. THE EFFECT OF PRACTICING YOGA FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE II DIABETES WAS ASSESSED IN THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW THROUGH SEARCHING RELATED ELECTRONIC DATABASES AND THE GREY LITERATURE TO THE END OF MAY 2007 USING OVID. ALL RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS (RCTS) COMPARING YOGA PRACTICE WITH OTHER TYPE OF INTERVENTION OR WITH REGULAR PRACTICE OR BOTH, WERE INCLUDED REGARDLESS OF LANGUAGE OR TYPE OF PUBLICATION. EACH STUDY WAS ASSESSED FOR QUALITY BY TWO INDEPENDENT REVIEWERS. MEAN DIFFERENCE WAS USED FOR SUMMARIZING THE EFFECT OF EACH STUDY OUTCOMES WITH 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS. POOLING OF THE STUDIES DID NOT TAKE PLACE DUE TO THE WIDE CLINICAL VARIATION BETWEEN THE STUDIES. PUBLICATION BIAS WAS ASSESSED BY STATISTICAL METHODS. FIVE TRIALS WITH 363 PARTICIPANTS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA WITH MEDIUM TO HIGH RISK OF BIAS AND DIFFERENT INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS. THE STUDIES' RESULTS SHOW IMPROVEMENT IN OUTCOMES AMONG PATIENTS WITH DIABETES TYPE II. THESE IMPROVEMENTS WERE MAINLY AMONG SHORT TERM OR IMMEDIATE DIABETES OUTCOMES AND NOT ALL WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. THE RESULTS WERE INCONCLUSIVE AND NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR THE LONG-TERM OUTCOMES. NO ADVERSE EFFECTS WERE REPORTED IN ANY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES. SHORT-TERM BENEFITS FOR PATIENTS WITH DIABETES MAY BE ACHIEVED FROM PRACTICING YOGA. FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED IN THIS AREA. FACTORS LIKE QUALITY OF THE TRIALS AND OTHER METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES SHOULD BE IMPROVED BY LARGE RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS WITH ALLOCATION CONCEALMENT TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA ON DIABETES TYPE II. A DEFINITIVE RECOMMENDATION FOR PHYSICIANS TO ENCOURAGE THEIR PATIENTS TO PRACTICE YOGA CANNOT BE REACHED AT PRESENT.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
19 2589  53 YOGA FOR LOW BACK PAIN: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS. IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT YOGA HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON LOW BACK PAIN AND FUNCTION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AS A TREATMENT OPTION FOR LOW BACK PAIN. SEVEN DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FROM THEIR INCEPTION TO MARCH 2011. RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS WERE CONSIDERED IF THEY INVESTIGATED YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH LOW BACK PAIN AND IF THEY ASSESSED PAIN AS AN OUTCOME MEASURE. THE SELECTION OF STUDIES, DATA EXTRACTION AND VALIDATION WERE PERFORMED INDEPENDENTLY BY TWO REVIEWERS. SEVEN RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS (RCTS) MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. THEIR METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY RANGED BETWEEN 2 AND 4 ON THE JADAD SCALE. FIVE RCTS SUGGESTED THAT YOGA LEADS TO A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER REDUCTION IN LOW BACK PAIN THAN USUAL CARE, EDUCATION OR CONVENTIONAL THERAPEUTIC EXERCISES. TWO RCTS SHOWED NO BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCES. IT IS CONCLUDED THAT YOGA HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ALLEVIATE LOW BACK PAIN. HOWEVER, ANY DEFINITIVE CLAIMS SHOULD BE TREATED WITH CAUTION.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
20 2657 108 YOGA IN ADDITION TO STANDARD CARE FOR PATIENTS WITH HAEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES. BACKGROUND: HAEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES ARE MALIGNANT NEOPLASMS OF THE MYELOID OR LYMPHATIC CELL LINES INCLUDING LEUKAEMIA, LYMPHOMA AND MYELOMA. IN ORDER TO MANAGE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF THE DISEASE AND ITS TREATMENT, COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES LIKE YOGA ARE COMING INCREASINGLY INTO FOCUS. HOWEVER, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA PRACTICE FOR PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM HAEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES REMAINS UNCLEAR. OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA PRACTICE IN ADDITION TO STANDARD CANCER TREATMENT FOR PEOPLE WITH HAEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES. SEARCH METHODS: OUR SEARCH STRATEGY INCLUDED THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (1950 TO 4TH FEBRUARY 2014), DATABASES OF ONGOING TRIALS (CONTROLLED-TRIALS.COM; CLINICALTRIALS.GOV), CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY, THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF HEMATOLOGY, THE EUROPEAN HAEMATOLOGY ASSOCIATION, THE EUROPEAN CONGRESS FOR INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE, AND GLOBAL ADVANCES IN HEALTH AND MEDICINE. WE HANDSEARCHED REFERENCES OF THESE STUDIES FROM IDENTIFIED TRIALS AND RELEVANT REVIEW ARTICLES. TWO REVIEW AUTHORS INDEPENDENTLY SCREENED THE SEARCH RESULTS. SELECTION CRITERIA: WE INCLUDED RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) OF YOGA IN ADDITION TO STANDARD CARE FOR HAEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES COMPARED WITH STANDARD CARE ONLY. WE DID NOT RESTRICT THIS TO ANY SPECIFIC STYLE OF YOGA. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: TWO REVIEW AUTHORS INDEPENDENTLY EXTRACTED DATA FOR ELIGIBLE STUDIES AND ASSESSED THE RISK OF BIAS ACCORDING TO PREDEFINED CRITERIA. WE EVALUATED DISTRESS, FATIGUE, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND QUALITY OF SLEEP. FURTHER OUTCOMES WE PLANNED TO ASSESS WERE HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL), OVERALL SURVIVAL (OS) AND ADVERSE EVENTS (AE), BUT DATA ON THESE WERE NOT AVAILABLE. MAIN RESULTS: OUR SEARCH STRATEGIES LED TO 149 POTENTIALLY RELEVANT REFERENCES, BUT ONLY A SINGLE SMALL STUDY MET OUR INCLUSION CRITERIA. THE INCLUDED STUDY WAS PUBLISHED AS A FULL TEXT ARTICLE AND INVESTIGATED THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFECT OF TIBETAN YOGA ADDITIONAL TO STANDARD CARE (N = 20; 1 PERSON DROPPED OUT BEFORE ATTENDING ANY CLASSES AND NO DATA WERE COLLECTED) COMPARED TO STANDARD CARE ONLY (N = 19). THE STUDY INCLUDED PEOPLE WITH ALL STAGES OF HODGKIN AND NON-HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA, WITH AND WITHOUT CURRENT CANCER TREATMENT. THE MEAN AGE WAS 51 YEARS.WE JUDGED THE OVERALL RISK OF BIAS AS HIGH AS WE FOUND A HIGH RISK FOR PERFORMANCE, DETECTION AND ATTRITION BIAS. ADDITIONALLY, POTENTIAL OUTCOME REPORTING BIAS COULD NOT BE COMPLETELY RULED OUT. FOLLOWING THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF GRADE, WE JUDGED THE OVERALL QUALITY OF THE BODY OF EVIDENCE FOR ALL PREDEFINED OUTCOMES AS 'VERY LOW', DUE TO THE METHODICAL LIMITATIONS AND THE VERY SMALL SAMPLE SIZE.THE INFLUENCE OF YOGA ON HRQOL AND OS WAS NOT REPORTED. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT YOGA IN ADDITION TO STANDARD CARE COMPARED WITH STANDARD CARE ONLY CAN IMPROVE DISTRESS IN PEOPLE WITH HAEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES (MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) -0.30, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) -5.55 TO 4.95; P = 0.91). SIMILARLY, THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EITHER GROUP FOR FATIGUE (MD 0.00, 95% CI -0.94 TO 0.94; P = 1.00), ANXIETY (MD 0.30, 95% CI -5.01 TO 5.61; P = 0.91) OR DEPRESSION (MD -0.70, 95% CI -3.21 TO 1.81; P = 0.58).THERE IS VERY LOW QUALITY EVIDENCE THAT YOGA IMPROVES THE OVERALL QUALITY OF SLEEP (MD -2.30, 95% CI -3.78 TO -0.82; P = 0.002). THE YOGA GROUPS' TOTAL SCORE FOR THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI) WAS 5.8 (+/- 2.3 SD) AND BETTER THAN THE TOTAL SCORE (8.1 (+/- 2.4 SD)) OF THE CONTROL GROUP. A PSQI TOTAL SCORE OF 0 TO 5 INDICATES GOOD SLEEP WHEREAS PSQI TOTAL SCORE 6 TO 21 POINTS TOWARDS SIGNIFICANT SLEEP DISTURBANCES. THE OCCURRENCE OF AES WAS NOT REPORTED. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE DATA PROVIDE LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM HAEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES. THE FINDING THAT YOGA MAY BE BENEFICIAL FOR THE PATIENTS' QUALITY OF SLEEP IS BASED ON A VERY SMALL BODY OF EVIDENCE. THEREFORE, THE ROLE OF YOGA AS AN ADDITIONAL THERAPY FOR HAEMATOLOGICAL MALIGNANCIES REMAINS UNCLEAR. FURTHER HIGH-QUALITY RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS WITH LARGER NUMBERS OF PARTICIPANTS ARE NEEDED TO MAKE A DEFINITIVE STATEMENT.	2014

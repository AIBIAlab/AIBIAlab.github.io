1 2044 125 THE ACUTE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON COGNITIVE MEASURES FOR WOMEN WITH PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME. OBJECTIVES: RECENTLY, YOGA CLASSES SPECIFICALLY FOR WOMEN WITH PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME (PMS) HAVE INCREASED, BUT THERE IS LITTLE RESEARCH ABOUT THE EFFICACY OF THESE CLASSES. THE PRIMARY AIMS OF THIS STUDY WERE TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA EXERCISE ON WOMEN WITH PMS AND TO EVALUATE THE IMMEDIATE CHANGE OF ATTENTION PERFORMANCE AFTER YOGA CLASSES. METHODS: THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE ATTENTION TASK RESULTS OF WOMEN WITH PMS. ELEVEN WOMEN WITH PMS AND 9 WOMEN WITHOUT PMS WERE RECRUITED. THE PMS GROUP TOOK THE TESTS BEFORE AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE YOGA CLASS BOTH IN THE LUTEAL AND FOLLICULAR PHASE OF ONE MENSTRUAL CYCLE, WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP TOOK THE TESTS ONLY TWICE: ONCE IN THE LUTEAL PHASE AND ONCE IN THE FOLLICULAR PHASE. BOTH GROUPS WERE REQUIRED TO FINISH RESTING ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY (EEG) AND COGNITIVE TASK OF THE 2-BACK TASK WITH EEG RECORDING. RESULTS: THE ALPHA BRAIN WAVE PERCENTAGE WAS HIGHER IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOGA EXERCISE IN THE PMS GROUP. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE PARTICIPANTS FELT MORE RELAXED OR WERE IN A MORE PEACEFUL MENTAL CONDITION AFTER YOGA EXERCISE. IN THE 2-BACK TASK, THE PMS GROUP NEEDED A LONGER REACTION TIME TO RESPOND TO THE TARGET STIMULUS IN THE LUTEAL PHASE AND PERFORMED BETTER WITH HIGHER ACCURACY AND SHORTER REACTION TIME AFTER YOGA EXERCISE. THE EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS OF THE EEG RECORDING DISPLAYED A SIGNIFICANT VARIABILITY AT THE P3 AMPLITUDE THROUGHOUT THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE IN THE PMS GROUP, BUT THE P3 AMPLITUDE WAS UNCHANGED THROUGHOUT THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE IN THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT WOMEN WITH PMS COULD ATTEND SHORT-TERM YOGA EXERCISE IN THE LUTEAL PHASE TO MAKE THEMSELVES FEEL BETTER AND MAINTAIN A BETTER ATTENTION LEVEL.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
2 1080  36 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF SLEEP OF WOMEN WITH PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME. OBJECTIVE: WOMEN WITH PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME (PMS) COMMONLY COMPLAIN OF SLEEP DISTURBANCES, SPECIFICALLY IN THE LUTEAL PHASE OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE. THEREFORE, THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF SLEEP OF WOMEN EXPERIENCING PMS WAS INVESTIGATED. MATERIAL AND METHODS: WOMEN (AGED 20-45 Y) MONITORED FOR PMS, WHO WERE REFERRED TO THE PRIVATE OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY CLINICS IN TABRIZ, IRAN, WERE REFERRED TO THE PRIVATE OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY CLINICS IN TABRIZ, IRAN. AFTERWARD, 62 WOMEN, WERE SELECTED AND DIVIDED INTO 2 GROUPS, RANDOMLY: 31 SUBJECTS IN YOGA THE YOGA GROUP AND 31 IN THE CONTROL GROUP. SUBJECTS IN YOGA PERFORMED FOR 10 WK IN 3 SESSIONS, WITH EACH SESSION LASTING 60 MIN. SUBJECTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT PERFORM ANY YOGA. SUBJECTS COMPLETED A DEMOGRAPHIC QUESTIONNAIRE AND THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX QUESTIONNAIRE BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA IN BOTH GROUPS. RESULTS: AFTER YOGA INTERVENTION, SUBJECTS SIGNIFICANTLY EXPRESSED IMPROVEMENT IN SLEEPING (P < .05). BASED ON THE MANN-WHITNEY U TEST, A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED IN THE SUBDOMAINS OF BOTH GROUPS ON QUALITY OF SLEEP (P < .01), SLEEP LATENCY (P < .01), AND SLEEP EFFICIENCY (P < .05). CONCLUSION: YOGA REDUCED THE DISTURBANCES OF SLEEP IN THE SUBJECTS WITH PMS, WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY IMPROVED THE EFFICIENCY OF THEIR SLEEP. THEREFORE, WE CONCLUDE THAT YOGA CAN BE PRESCRIBED FOR IMPROVING SLEEP DISTURBANCES IN WOMEN WITH PMS AND MEDICAL THERAPY WILL PROBABLY BE NEEDED IN SEVERE SITUATIONS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
3  519  29 COMPARING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA & ORAL CALCIUM ADMINISTRATION IN ALLEVIATING SYMPTOMS OF PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME IN MEDICAL UNDERGRADUATES. INTRODUCTION: MEDICAL UNDERGRADUATES ARE HEAVILY BURDENED BY THEIR CURRICULUM. THE FEMALES, IN ADDITION, SUFFER FROM VIVID AFFECTIVE OR SOMATIC PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME (PMS) SYMPTOMS SUCH AS BLOATING, MASTALGIA, INSOMNIA, FATIGUE, MOOD SWINGS, IRRITABILITY, AND DEPRESSION. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS PROPOSED TO ATTENUATE THE SYMPTOMS OF PMS BY SIMPLE LIFESTYLE MEASURES LIKE YOGA AND/OR ORAL CALCIUM. METHODS: 65 MEDICAL FEMALE STUDENTS (18-22 YEARS) WITH A REGULAR MENSTRUAL CYCLE WERE ASKED TO SELF-RATE THEIR SYMPTOMS, ALONG WITH THEIR SEVERITY, IN A VALIDATED QUESTIONNAIRE FOR TWO CONSECUTIVE MENSTRUAL CYCLES. FIFTY-EIGHT STUDENTS WERE FOUND TO HAVE PMS. TWENTY GIRLS WERE GIVEN YOGA TRAINING (45 MINUTES DAILY, FIVE DAYS A WEEK, FOR THREE MONTHS). ANOTHER GROUP OF 20 WAS GIVEN ORAL TABLETS OF CALCIUM CARBONATE DAILY (500 MG, FOR THREE MONTHS) AND REST 18 GIRL SERVED AS CONTROL GROUP. DATA WERE ANALYZED BY SPSS VER.13 SOFTWARE. RESULTS: THE YOGA AND CALCIUM GROUPS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN NUMBER AND SEVERITY OF PREMENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS WHEREAS IN THE CONTROL GROUP THERE WAS NOT THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE. CONCLUSION: ENCOURAGING A REGULAR PRACTICE OF YOGA OR TAKING A TABLET OF CALCIUM DAILY IN THE MEDICAL SCHOOLS CAN DECREASE THE SYMPTOMS OF PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
4 2737  33 YOGA POSITIVELY AFFECTED DEPRESSION AND BLOOD PRESSURE IN WOMEN WITH PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL. WOMEN WITH PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME (PMS) OFTEN COMPLAIN ABOUT DEPRESSION WHEN THEIR MENSTRUAL CYCLE BEGINS. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON WOMEN WITH PMS SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION DURING MENSTRUAL CYCLE. METHODS: THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED FROM APRIL TO OCTOBER 2015 IN TABRIZ, IRAN. ALL SUBJECTS (20-45 YEARS OLD), WHO WERE FREQUENTLY REFERRED TO THE PRIVATE OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY CLINICS, WERE INITIALLY MONITORED FOR PMS AND DEPRESSION. SUBJECTS COMPLETED THE DEMOGRAPHIC AND BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY-II (BDI-II) QUESTIONNAIRES BEFORE AND AFTER INTERVENTION. IN ADDITION, SUBJECTS WERE MONITORED FOR ELIGIBLE AND INELIGIBLE CRITERIA. IN THIS STUDY 62 SUBJECTS WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED FOR THE YOGA GROUP AND CONTROL GROUPS. SUBJECTS PRACTICED YOGA OVER TWO MONTHS IN THREE SESSIONS, THE DURATION OF EACH SESSION WAS 60MIN. RESULTS: THE GENERAL SCORE OF THE DEPRESSION AFTER YOGA INTERVENTION WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP (P<0.036) AND YOGA GROUP BEFORE INTERVENTION (P<0.001). THE DIASTOLIC PRESSURE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER YOGA INTERVENTION (P<0.029). YOGA DECREASED THE STATE OF DEPRESSION AND DIASTOLIC PRESSURE OF THE SUBJECTS WITH PMS COMPLAINING FROM DEPRESSION. CONCLUSION: WE CONCLUDE THAT YOGA HAS STRONG EFFECTS ON DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AND BLOOD PRESSURE, THEREFORE IT CAN BE USED AS A COMPLEMENTARY OR ALTERNATIVE REMEDY FOR PMS PATIENTS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
5 2136  30 THE EFFECTS OF ACUPRESSURE AND YOGA FOR COPING WITH PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROMES ON PREMENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMS TO IDENTIFY THE EFFECTS OF ACUPRESSURE AND YOGA FOR COPING WITH PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROMES (PMS) ON THE PREMENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE. METHODS: THIS STUDY ADOPTED A RANDOMIZED INTERVENTION DESIGN WITH A PRETEST-POSTTEST CONTROL GROUP. THE SAMPLE CONSISTED OF 155 STUDENTS WITH PMS COMPLAINTS (50 IN YOGA, 51 IN ACUPRESSURE, AND 54 IN CONTROL GROUP). THE STUDENTS IN THE INTERVENTION GROUPS DID YOGA AND RECEIVED ACUPRESSURE THROUGHOUT 12 WEEKS. RESULTS: IT WAS FOUND THAT THE PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME SCALE POSTTEST MEAN SCORE OF THE STUDENTS WAS LOWER, AND THE PHYSICAL HEALTH, PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH, AND ENVIRONMENT SUB-SCALE MEAN SCORES OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE WERE HIGHER IN THE YOGA GROUP IN COMPARISON TO THE OTHER GROUPS (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: YOGA WAS FOUND TO BE A MORE EFFECTIVE NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL METHOD FOR COPING WITH PREMENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
6 2303  41 TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA ON PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME. BACKGROUND: EIGHTY PERCENT OF WOMEN DURING THEIR REPRODUCTIVE AGE EXPERIENCE SOME SYMPTOMS ATTRIBUTED TO PREMENSTRUAL PHASE OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE. PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME (PMS) IS CHARACTERIZED BY EMOTIONAL, BEHAVIORAL, AND PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS THAT OCCUR DURING LATE LUTEAL PHASE OF MENSTRUAL CYCLE AND ARE RELIEVED AFTER THE ONSET OF MENSTRUATION. AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA ARE ONE OF THE WAYS TO REDUCE THESE SYMPTOMS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA ON PMS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 72 PARTICIPANTS OF PMS, REFERRED FOR PHYSIOTHERAPY TREATMENT (MEAN AGE 28 YEARS), WERE ENROLLED AND ALLOCATED INTO TWO GROUPS (GROUP A AND B) BY SIMPLE COMPUTERIZED RANDOMIZATION. PATIENTS IN GROUP A RECEIVED AEROBIC EXERCISE AND IN GROUP B RECEIVED YOGA MOVEMENTS FOR 40 MIN, 3 TIMES A WEEK FOR 1 MONTH. THE PAIN INTENSITY (VISUAL ANALOG SCALE) AND PMS SCALE WERE MEASURED BEFORE, AT THE END OF 15 DAYS, AND 1 MONTH OF TREATMENT PROGRAM. RESULTS: DATA WERE ANALYZED BY PAIRED T-TEST, UNPAIRED T-TEST, AND ONE-WAY ANOVA; AND THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT BOTH AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA MOVEMENTS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED PAIN INTENSITY AND PMS SYMPTOMS. SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PMS SYMPTOMS WAS FOUND IN PATIENTS TREATED WITH YOGA COMPARED TO AEROBIC EXERCISE; HOWEVER, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND IN PAIN INTENSITY BETWEEN THESE TWO GROUPS (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: IT IS CONCLUDED THAT BOTH AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA MOVEMENTS ARE EFFECTIVE IN TREATING PMS; HOWEVER, YOGA IS MORE EFFECTIVE IN RELIEVING THE SYMPTOMS OF PMS THAN AEROBIC EXERCISE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
7  789  27 EFFECT OF YOGA EXERCISE ON PREMENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS AMONG FEMALE EMPLOYEES IN TAIWAN. YOGA CLASSES DESIGNED FOR WOMEN WITH PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME ARE AVAILABLE, BUT THEIR EFFICACY IS UNCLEAR. WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF 12 WEEKS' YOGA EXERCISE (YOGA INTERVENTION) ON PREMENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS IN MENSTRUATING FEMALES IN TAIWAN. SIXTY-FOUR SUBJECTS COMPLETED THE YOGA INTERVENTION, AND BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION FILLED OUT A STRUCTURED SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRE ABOUT THEIR DEMOGRAPHICS, PERSONAL LIFESTYLE, MENSTRUAL STATUS, BASELINE MENSTRUAL PAIN SCORES, PREMENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS, AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE. OF 64 SUBJECTS, 90.6% REPORTED EXPERIENCING MENSTRUAL PAIN DURING MENSTRUATION. AFTER THE YOGA INTERVENTION, SUBJECTS REPORTED DECREASED USE OF ANALGESICS DURING MENSTRUATION (P = 0.0290) AND DECREASED MODERATE OR SEVERE EFFECTS OF MENSTRUAL PAIN ON WORK (P = 0.0011). THE YOGA EXERCISE INTERVENTION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE SCALE OF PHYSICAL FUNCTION (P = 0.0340) AND BODILY PAIN (P = 0.0087) OF THE SF-36, AND SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED ABDOMINAL SWELLING (P = 0.0011), BREAST TENDERNESS (P = 0.0348), ABDOMINAL CRAMPS (P = 0.0016), AND COLD SWEATS (P = 0.0143). MENSTRUAL PAIN MITIGATION AFTER YOGA EXERCISE CORRELATED WITH IMPROVEMENT IN SIX SCALES OF THE SF-36 (PHYSICAL FUNCTION, BODILY PAIN, GENERAL HEALTH PERCEPTION, VITALITY/ENERGY, SOCIAL FUNCTION, MENTAL HEALTH). EMPLOYERS CAN EDUCATE FEMALE EMPLOYEES ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF REGULAR EXERCISE SUCH AS YOGA, WHICH MAY DECREASE PREMENSTRUAL DISTRESS AND IMPROVE FEMALE EMPLOYEE HEALTH.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
8 1399  28 IMPACT OF YOGA NIDRA ON MENSTRUAL ABNORMALITIES IN FEMALES OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE. OBJECTIVES: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO OBSERVE THE EFFECT OF YOGA NIDRA PRACTICE ON HORMONE LEVELS IN PATIENTS WHO HAD MENSTRUAL IRREGULARITIES. DESIGN: THE STUDY WAS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTINGS/LOCATION: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY AT CHHATRAPATI SAHUJI MAHARAJ MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, UTTAR PRADESH, LUCKNOW, INDIA. SUBJECTS WERE DIVIDED RANDOMLY INTO 2 GROUPS-AN INTERVENTION AND A CONTROL GROUP, WITH 75 SUBJECTS IN EACH GROUP. OF THESE SUBJECTS, 126 COMPLETED THE STUDY PROTOCOL. SUBJECTS: THIS STUDY INVOLVED 150 SUBJECTS WITH MENSTRUAL IRREGULARITIES; 126 OF WHOM COMPLETED THE PROTOCOL. INTERVENTIONS: THE INTERVENTION WAS THE PRACTICE OF YOGA NIDRA. THE YOGIC INTERVENTION DURATION WAS 35-40 MINUTES/DAY, FIVE TIMES/WEEK FOR 6 MONTHS. AN ESTIMATION OF HORMONAL PROFILE WAS DONE FOR BOTH GROUPS AT BASELINE AND AFTER 6 MONTHS. RESULTS: THYROID-STIMULATING HORMONE (P<0.002), FOLLICLE-STIMULATING HORMONE (P<0.02), LUTEINIZING HORMONE (P<0.001), AND PROLACTIN (P<0.02) WERE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP, COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: THE PRESENT STUDY DEMONSTRATED THE EFFICACY OF YOGA NIDRA ON HORMONE PROFILES IN PATIENTS WITH MENSTRUAL IRREGULARITIES. YOGA NIDRA PRACTICE WAS HELPFUL IN PATIENTS WITH HORMONE IMBALANCES, SUCH AS DYSMENORRHEA, OLIGOMENORRHEA, MENORRHAGIA, METRORRHAGIA, AND HYPOMENORRHEA.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
9  766  34 EFFECT OF THREE YOGA POSES (COBRA, CAT AND FISH POSES) IN WOMEN WITH PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA: A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: WE HAVE EVALUATED THE CLINICAL EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA. PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA OCCURS IN 50% OF FEMALE ADOLESCENTS AND IS A COMMON PROBLEM IN WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE. WE HAVE ASSESSED WHETHER THREE YOGA POSES (COBRA, CAT, AND FISH POSES) ARE ABLE TO REDUCE SEVERITY AND DURATION OF PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA. METHODS: TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN ADOLESCENTS WITH PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA, 92 GIRL STUDENTS,18-22 YEARS OLD, WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO AN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (N = 50) AND A CONTROL GROUP (N = 42). THE VISUAL ANALOG SCALE FOR PAIN WAS USED TO ASSESS INTENSITY OF PAIN AND THE PAIN DURATION WAS CALCULATED IN TERMS OF HOURS. EACH GROUP WAS EVALUATED FOR THREE MENSTRUAL CYCLES. AT FIRST CYCLE NO METHOD WAS PRESENTED; THE PARTICIPANTS ONLY WERE ASKED TO COMPLETE THE QUESTIONNAIRE OF MENSTRUAL CHARACTERISTICS DURING THEIR MENSTRUAL. THEN THE PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED BY THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP TO DO YOGA POSES AT LUTEAL PHASE, AND ALSO TO COMPLETE THE MENSTRUAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE IN DURING OF MENSTRUATION. THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT RECEIVE ANY INTERVENTION EXCEPT TO COMPLETE MENSTRUAL CHARACTERISTICS QUESTIONNAIRE IN DURING OF MENSTRUATION. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE PAIN INTENSITY AND PAIN DURATION IN THE POST-TESTS COMPARED WITH THE PRETEST IN YOGA GROUP (P < 0.05). THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE PAIN INTENSITY AND PAIN DURATION IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: YOGA REDUCED THE SEVERITY AND DURATION OF PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA POSES ARE SAFE AND SIMPLE TREATMENT FOR PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
10  849  41 EFFECT OF YOGA ON SERUM HOMOCYSTEINE AND NITRIC OXIDE LEVELS IN ADOLESCENT WOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT DYSMENORRHEA. BACKGROUND: THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT STUDY IS TO EXPLORE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE SERUM LEVELS OF HOMOCYSTEINE AND NITRIC OXIDE (NO) IN A COHORT OF WOMEN WITH PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA AND NORMAL HEALTHY CONTROLS. METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED IN 35 WOMEN WITH PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA AND 35 HEALTHY CONTROLS IN A COMMUNITY-BASED STUDY. SHORT-FORM MENSTRUAL DISTRESS QUESTIONNAIRES (MDQS) WERE ADMINISTERED TO ASSESS THE MENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS. ALL PARTICIPANTS WERE PROVIDED YOGA INTERVENTION, TWICE A WEEK AT 30 MINUTES/SESSION, CONSECUTIVELY FOR 8 WEEKS. BLOOD SAMPLES WERE DRAWN FROM EACH WOMAN ON THE THIRD DAY OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE. ASSESSMENTS OF MDQS AND BLOOD SAMPLES FOR THE DETERMINATION OF HOMOCYSTEINE AND NO CONCENTRATIONS WERE PERFORMED AT BASELINE AND WITHIN THE FIRST 3 DAYS OF THEIR NEXT MENSES AFTER COMPLETION OF YOGA INTERVENTION. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 30 WOMEN FROM THE DYSMENORRHEAL GROUP AND 30 FROM THE CONTROL GROUP COMPLETED THE STUDY. HOMOCYSTEINE LEVELS WERE HIGHER IN THOSE WITH DYSMENORRHEA WHEN COMPARED WITH HEALTHY CONTROLS BEFORE YOGA INTERVENTION (MANN-WHITNEY U TEST, P<0.05); HOWEVER, NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS AFTER 8 WEEKS OF YOGA TRAINING (P<0.05). THE CONCENTRATIONS OF HOMOCYSTEINE IN BOTH THE DYSMENORRHEAL AND CONTROL GROUPS AFTER 8 WEEKS DECREASED BY 51.37% AND 46.46%, RESPECTIVELY (P<0.001). THERE WERE NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN NO LEVELS BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS AT BASELINE AND AFTER INTERVENTION. THE TOTAL SCORES ON THE MDQS DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER YOGA INTERVENTION IN THE DYSMENORRHEAL GROUP (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: YOGA INTERVENTION WAS FOUND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCTIONS IN SEVERITY OF DYSMENORRHEA AND MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN LOWERING SERUM HOMOCYSTEINE LEVELS AFTER AN INTERVENTION PERIOD OF 8 WEEKS. THESE OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY HAVE THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS IN WOMEN BY RESTORING ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION.	2013

AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO SEE ANY EFFECT ON AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS IN MENSTRUAL DISTURBANCES PATIENTS AFTER YOGA NIDRA PRACTICE. THE SUBJECTS FOR THE STUDY WERE 150 FEMALES WITH MENSTRUAL IRREGULARITIES, 28.08 +/- 7.43 YEARS OF MEAN AGE, REFERRED FROM DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY CSMMU, UP, LUCKNOW. SUBJECTS WERE DIVIDED RANDOMLY IN TO TWO GROUPS' INTERVENTION AND IN CONTROL GROUPS -SEVENTY FIVE (75) IN EACH GROUP. OUT OF THESE, ONE HUNDRED TWENTY SIX (126) COMPLETED THE STUDY PROTOCOL. THE YOGIC INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF 35-40 MINUTES/DAY, FIVE DAYS IN A WEEK TILL SIX MONTHS. AN AUTONOMIC FUNCTION TESTING WAS DONE IN BOTH THE GROUPS AT ZERO TIME AND AFTER SIX MONTHS. A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECT WAS OBSERVED WHEN YOGA THERAPY WAS USED AS AN ADJUNCT IN THE PATIENTS OF MENSTRUAL DISTURBANCES. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE BLOOD PRESSURE, POSTURAL HYPOTENSION AND SUSTAINED HAND GRIP, HEART RATE EXPIRATION INSPIRATION RATIO AND 30:15 BEAT RATIOS OF THE SUBJECTS AFTER YOGIC PRACTICE.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
12  954  31 EFFECTS OF A HOLISTIC YOGA PROGRAM ON ENDOCRINE PARAMETERS IN ADOLESCENTS WITH POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS TRIAL WERE TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF A HOLISTIC YOGA PROGRAM WITH THE CONVENTIONAL EXERCISE PROGRAM IN ADOLESCENT POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME (PCOS). DESIGN: THIS WAS A PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, ACTIVE CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: NINETY (90) ADOLESCENT (15-18 YEARS) GIRLS FROM A RESIDENTIAL COLLEGE IN ANDHRA PRADESH WHO SATISFIED THE ROTTERDAM CRITERIA WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS. INTERVENTION: THE YOGA GROUP PRACTICED A HOLISTIC YOGA MODULE, WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP PRACTICED A MATCHING SET OF PHYSICAL EXERCISES (1 HOUR/DAY, FOR 12 WEEKS). OUTCOME MEASURES: ANTI-MULLERIAN HORMONE (AMH-PRIMARY OUTCOME), LUTEINIZING HORMONE (LH), FOLLICLE-STIMULATING HORMONE (FSH), TESTOSTERONE, PROLACTIN, BODY-MASS INDEX (BMI), HIRSUTISM, AND MENSTRUAL FREQUENCY WERE MEASURED AT INCLUSION AND AFTER 12 WEEKS. RESULTS: MANN-WHITNEY TEST ON DIFFERENCE SCORE SHOWS THAT CHANGES IN AMH (Y=-2.51, C=-0.49, P=0.006), LH, AND LH/FSH RATIO (LH: Y=-4.09, C=3.00, P=0.005; LH/FSH: Y=-1.17, C=0.49, P=0.015) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE TWO INTERVENTION GROUPS. ALSO, CHANGES IN TESTOSTERONE (Y=-6.01, C=2.61, P=0.014) AND MODIFIED FERRIMAN AND GALLWAY (MFG) SCORE (Y=-1.14, C=+0.06, P=0.002) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. ON THE OTHER HAND, CHANGES IN FSH AND PROLACTIN POSTINTERVENTION WERE NONSIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. ALSO, BODY WEIGHT AND BMI SHOWED NONSIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT CHANGES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS, WHILE CHANGES IN MENSTRUAL FREQUENCY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS (Y=0.89, C=0.49, P=0.049). CONCLUSIONS: A HOLISTIC YOGA PROGRAM FOR 12 WEEKS IS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN PHYSICAL EXERCISE IN REDUCING AMH, LH, AND TESTOSTERONE, MFG SCORE FOR HIRSUTISM, AND IMPROVING MENSTRUAL FREQUENCY WITH NONSIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN BODY WEIGHT, FSH, AND PROLACTIN IN ADOLESCENT PCOS.	2013	
                                          
13 2091  30 THE EFFECT OF TELE-YOGA TRAINING IN HEALTHY WOMEN ON MENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS, QUALITY OF LIFE, ANXIETY-DEPRESSION LEVEL, BODY AWARENESS, AND SELF-ESTEEM DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: THIS STUDY WAS PLANNED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF TELE-YOGA TRAINING ON MENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS, QUALITY OF LIFE, ANXIETY-DEPRESSION LEVEL, BODY AWARENESS, AND SELF-ESTEEM IN HEALTHY WOMEN. METHODS: THIRTY-TWO HEALTHY PREMENOPAUSAL WOMEN BETWEEN THE AGES OF 18 AND 45 WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. THE WOMEN WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS AS TELE-YOGA TRAINING (N: 16) AND THE CONTROL GROUP (N: 16). THE TELE-YOGA TRAINING WAS PERFORMED ON THE ZOOM SOFTWARE FOR 6 WEEKS, 2 TIMES A WEEK AND 45 MIN A DAY. NO INTERVENTION WAS MADE IN THE CONTROL GROUP. MENSTRUAL PAIN AND SYMPTOMS BY MENSTRUAL SYMPTOM SCALE (MSS), QUALITY OF LIFE BY NOTTINGHAM HEALTH PROFILE (NHP), DEPRESSION LEVELS BY BECK DEPRESSION SCALE (BDS), ANXIETY LEVELS BY STATE AND TRAIT ANXIETY SCALE (STAI), BODY AWARENESS BY BODY AWARENESS QUESTIONNAIRE (BAQ), AND SELF-ESTEEM BY ROSENBERG SELF-ESTEEM SCALE (RSES) WERE DETERMINED. RESULTS: IN THE TELE-YOGA TRAINING GROUP, STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE OBSERVED IN THE MSS TOTAL (P = 0.001), NEGATIVE EFFECTS (P = 0.003), MENSTRUAL PAIN SYMPTOMS (P = 0.003), COPING METHODS (P = 0.001) SUB-PARAMETERS, BDS SCORE (P = 0.000), NHP SLEEP (P = 0.021), ENERGY (P = 0.002), EMOTIONAL (P = 0.000), AND ISOLATION (P = 0.039) SUB-PARAMETERS. IN THE CONTROL GROUP, THERE WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT WORSENING IN THE NHP TOTAL SCORE (P = 0.000). AS REGARDS THE DIFFERENCES IN VALUES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS, THERE WERE STATISTICALLY DIFFERENCE IN FAVOR OF THE TRAINING GROUP IN SUB-PARAMETERS OF MSS, NHP SLEEP, ENERGY, EMOTIONAL, AND ISOLATION SUB-PARAMETERS, AND BDS AND BAQ SCORES (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: IT IS THOUGHT THAT TELE-YOGA TRAINING MAY BE A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE METHOD IN REDUCING MENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS AND DEPRESSION, INCREASING QUALITY OF LIFE, AND BODY AWARENESS.	2022	
                                                                            
14  963  28 EFFECTS OF A YOGA PROGRAM ON MENSTRUAL CRAMPS AND MENSTRUAL DISTRESS IN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WITH PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA: A SINGLE-BLIND, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA PROGRAM ON MENSTRUAL CRAMPS AND MENSTRUAL DISTRESS IN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WITH PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA. DESIGN: SINGLE-BLIND, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. PARTICIPANTS: 40 RANDOMLY SELECTED UNDERGRADUATE NURSING STUDENTS, WITH 20 EACH ASSIGNED TO AN EXERCISE OR A CONTROL GROUP. INTERVENTION: THE PARTICIPANTS ENGAGED IN A YOGA PROGRAM FOR 60 MINUTES ONCE A WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS. THE PROGRAM CONSISTED OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE COMBINED WITH RELAXATION AND MEDITATION. OUTCOME MEASURES: MENSTRUAL CRAMPS AND MENSTRUAL DISTRESS LEVELS WERE MEASURED BY USING THE VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE FOR PAIN AND THE MENSTRUAL DISTRESS QUESTIONNAIRE, RESPECTIVELY. DATA WERE ANALYZED BY USING THE KOLMOGOROV-SMIRNOV AND SHAPIRO-WILK NORMALITY TESTS, T-TEST, CHI-SQUARE TEST, LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS, AND MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (SPSS PROGRAM). RESULTS: MENSTRUAL PAIN INTENSITY (GROUP DIFFERENCE, -0.94; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI], -1.47 TO -0.42; P = 0.001) AND MENSTRUAL DISTRESS (GROUP DIFFERENCE, -1.13; 95% CI, -1.43 TO -0.82; P < 0.0001) SCORES DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT YOGA INTERVENTIONS MAY REDUCE MENSTRUAL CRAMPS AND MENSTRUAL DISTRESS IN FEMALE UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WITH PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
15 1968  27 SERUM MINERAL STATUS AND CLIMACTERIC SYMPTOMS IN PERIMENOPAUSAL WOMEN BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA THERAPY, AN ONGOING STUDY. BACKGROUND: MANY WOMEN REPORT AN INCREASED LEVEL OF ANXIETY, IRRITABILITY AND MOOD SWINGS DURING THEIR PERIMENOPAUSAL STATE. STUDIES SHOW THAT PHYSICALLY ACTIVE PEOPLE CAN REDUCE THEIR ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION BY PRACTICING YOGA. SERUM MINERALS SUCH AS CALCIUM, COPPER AND MAGNESIUM AND THE FERRO-OXIDASE, CERULOPLASMIN PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE BODY DURING THE PERIMENOPAUSAL PERIOD. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO ASSESS THE SERUM MINERAL STATUS, ANTHROPOMETRIC PARAMETERS AND CLIMACTERIC SYMPTOMS IN PERIMENOPAUSAL WOMEN BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA INTERVENTION. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 30 SUBJECTS WITH PERIMENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS, AGED BETWEEN 40 AND 60 YEARS (49.43 +/- 6.15) WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. YOGA INTERVENTION WAS GIVEN ON A DAILY BASIS (45 MIN DURATION) FOR 12 WEEKS. THE CLIMACTERIC SYMPTOMS WERE ASSESSED BY GREENE'S CLIMACTERIC SCALE AND BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS WERE ANALYZED SPECTROPHOTOMETRICALLY. RESULTS: A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE WAIST HIP RATIO (P < 0.036) AND BODY MASS INDEX (P < 0.036) WAS OBSERVED AFTER YOGA INTERVENTION. SYSTOLIC (P < 0.064) AND DIASTOLIC (P < 0.082) BLOOD PRESSURE (BP) SHOWED MARGINAL DECREASE AFTER YOGA THERAPY. CLIMACTERIC SYMPTOMS IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY (P < 0.001) AFTER YOGA INTERVENTION. A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE (P < 0.001) IN SERUM CALCIUM AND COPPER AND A MARKED DECREASE IN SERUM MAGNESIUM (P < 0.05) AND CERULOPLASMIN (P < 0.028) LEVELS WAS OBSERVED, POST YOGA THERAPY. SERUM MAGNESIUM NEGATIVELY CORRELATED (R = -0.467, P < 0.035) WITH SYSTOLIC BP AFTER YOGA INTERVENTION. CONCLUSION: THE OVERALL CHANGES OBSERVED IN THE MINERAL STATUS AND CLIMACTERIC SYMPTOMS SUGGEST THAT YOGA THERAPY PROTOCOL CAN BE EFFECTIVELY USED TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN PERIMENOPAUSAL WOMEN.	2013

17 1823  33 PSYCHO-BIOLOGICAL CHANGES WITH ADD ON YOGA NIDRA IN PATIENTS WITH MENSTRUAL DISORDERS: A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: MENSTRUAL DISORDERS ARE COMMON PROBLEMS AMONG WOMEN IN THE REPRODUCTIVE AGE GROUP. YUGA INTERVENTIONS MAY DECREASE THE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS RELATED TO MENSTRUAL DISORDERS. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS AIMED TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF YOGA NIDRA ON PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS IN PATIENTS WITH MENSTRUAL DISORDERS. METHODS: A TOTAL NUMBER OF 100 WOMEN RECRUITED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY AND WERE THEN RANDOMLY ALLOCATED INTO TWO GROUPS: A) INTERVENTION RECEIVED YOGIC INTERVENTION AND MEDICATION FOR 6 MONTH, AND B) CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED NO YOGIC INTERVENTION AND THEY ONLY RECEIVED PRESCRIBED MEDICATION). PSYCHOLOGICAL GENERAL WELL-BEING INDEX (PGWBI) AND HORMONAL PROFILE WERE ASSESSED AT THE TIME OF BEFORE AND AFTER SIX MONTHS ON BOTH GROUPS. RESULTS: THE MEAN SCORE OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, POSITIVE WELL-BEING, GENERAL HEALTH, AND VITALITY SCORES, AS WELL AS HORMONAL LEVELS, IN POSTTEST WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT IN INTERVENTION GROUP AS COMPARED WITH PRETEST. BUT THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: YOGA NIDRA CAN BE A SUCCESSFUL THERAPY TO OVERCOME THE PSYCHIATRIC MORBIDITY ASSOCIATED WITH MENSTRUAL IRREGULARITIES. THEREFORE, YOGIC RELAXATION TRAINING (YOGA NIDRA) COULD BE PRESCRIBED AS AN ADJUNCT TO CONVENTIONAL DRUG THERAPY FOR MENSTRUAL DYSFUNCTION.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
18 2107  29 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON PAIN LEVEL IN PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA. THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON PAIN LEVELS IN FEMALE STUDENTS WITH PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA. THIS STUDY IS A RANDOMIZED EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WITH CONTROL GROUP AND PRETEST POST-TEST PRACTICE. THIS STUDY INCLUDED 60 VOLUNTEER FEMALE STUDENTS (30 EXPERIMENTAL AND 30 CONTROL GROUPS). THE PATIENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP TOOK PART IN THE YOGA PROGRAM A TOTAL OF 12 SESSIONS, ONCE PER WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS. "PERSONAL INFORMATION FORM", "VISUAL ANALOG SKALA (VAS)" AND "DYSMENORRHEA MONITORING FORM (DMF)" WERE USED IN DATA COLLECTION PROCESS. TO MEASURE DYSMENORRHEA PAIN, THE STUDENTS WERE REQUESTED TO MARK A NUMBER BETWEEN 1 AND 10 ON THE VAS SCALE ACCORDING TO THE SEVERITY OF THEIR PAIN ON THE MENSTRUATION STARTING DATE. THE YOGA APPLICATIONS WERE USED FOR THREE MENSTRUAL CYCLES. THE MEAN AGE OF THE STUDENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS 20.30 +/- 0.46, WHILE THE MEAN AGE OF THE STUDENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP WAS 20.46 +/- 0.50. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PAIN LEVELS OF THE STUDENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP IN THE FIRST, SECOND, THIRD AND FOURTH MEASUREMENTS WAS FOUND TO BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.001). IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PAIN LEVELS OF THE STUDENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP IN THE FIRST, SECOND, THIRD AND FOURTH MEASUREMENTS WAS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P > 0.05). YOGA CAN BE USED AS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION IN REDUCING MENSTRUAL PAIN IN WOMEN WITH PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
19  704  22 EFFECT OF INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA AND NATUROPATHY ON POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME: A CASE STUDY. OWING TO STRESS, SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE AND CHANGES IN DIET PATTERN, THERE IS AN INCREASE IN THE SURGE OF LIFESTYLE AND METABOLIC DISORDERS. POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME (PCOS) AFFECTS 8-13% OF REPRODUCTIVE-AGED WOMEN. PCOS IS CHARACTERISED BY MENSTRUAL IRREGULARITY, HYPERANDROGENISM AND POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN MORPHOLOGY (PCOM). THE EFFICACY OF YOGA AS A THERAPY TO TACKLE THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT CAUSE OF AILMENT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PCOS IS TO BE DOCUMENTED. THIS IS THE CASE STUDY OF A FEMALE PATIENT AGE 25 YEARS, A DIAGNOSED CASE OF PCOS WAS REGISTERED AT THE AYURVEDA, YOGA, UNANI,SIDDHA,HOMEOPATHY (AYUSH), YOGA OPD, WITH COMPLAINTS OF IRREGULAR MENSTRUATION, TREATED SUCCESSFULLY BY YOGA AND NATUROPATHY (Y AND N), I.E., YOGA, DIET AND LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION. THIS IS EVIDENT FROM THE REDUCTION IN WEIGHT, REGULARISATION OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE ALONG WITH MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE OVARY AFTER A FOLLOW-UP OF 6 MONTHS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
20 2784  20 YOGA THERAPY AS AN ADJUNCT TO TRADITIONAL TOOTH BRUSHING TRAINING METHODS IN CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER. AIM: TO EVALUATE IF YOGA COULD BE AN ADJUNCT TO REGULAR TRAINING METHODS IN TRAINING BRUSHING SKILL TO CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (ASD). METHODS: SEVENTY-TWO CHILDREN WITH ASD AGED 7-15 YEARS WERE SELECTED AND DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS (N = 36). CHILDREN IN GROUP I RECEIVED VISUAL PEDAGOGY AND VIDEO MODELING AND CHILDREN IN GROUP II RECEIVED VISUAL PEDAGOGY AND VIDEO MODELING WITH YOGA. PLAQUE AND GINGIVAL INDICES (PI AND GI) WERE RECORDED AT BASELINE AND AT THE END OF FIRST, SECOND, THIRD, AND SIXTH MONTH. THE SCORES WERE SUMMARIZED AS MEAN AND STANDARD DEVIATION AND INTER-GROUP COMPARISON WAS DONE USING INDEPENDENT T-TEST. RESULTS: INTER-GROUP COMPARISON OF MEAN PLAQUE AND GINGIVAL INDICES SCORES WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AT SECOND MONTH (P = .039 FOR PI AND P = .009 FOR GI). THE SCORES WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EVEN AT THIRD MONTH (P = .001 FOR PI AND P = .002 FOR GI) AND SIXTH MONTH (P = .001 PI AND GI), WITH CHILDREN IN GROUP II DEMONSTRATING BETTER ORAL HYGIENE. CONCLUSION: YOGA TRAINING CAN BE USED AS AN ADJUNCT TO ENHANCE TOOTH BRUSHING LEARNING CAPABILITIES OF CHILDREN WITH ASD IN ADDITION TO VISUAL MODELING AND PEDAGOGY.	2019

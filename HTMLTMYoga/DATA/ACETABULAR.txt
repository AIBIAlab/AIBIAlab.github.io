1 2288 112 THE YOGA MAT TECHNIQUE IN POSTLESS HIP ARTHROSCOPY. HIP ARTHROSCOPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF FEMOROACETABULAR IMPINGEMENT SYNDROME WITH ANTI-SLIDING TECHNIQUES AND WITHOUT THE USE OF A PERINEAL POST TO ACHIEVE HIP DISTRACTION HAS INCREASED GREATLY IN THE PAST 5 TO 10 YEARS. TO ACCESS THE HIP JOINT, DISTRACTION IS MANDATORY TO TREAT INTRA-ARTICULAR DISORDERS SUCH AS LABRAL TEARS, ACETABULAR CARTILAGE DEFECTS, LOOSE BODIES, LIGAMENTUM TERES TEARS, AND AVASCULAR NECROSIS OF THE HIP. IN HIP DISTRACTION, COUNTER-DISTRACTION IS NEEDED, AND THIS IS ACHIEVED WITH A BULKY AND CUSHIONED PERINEAL POST. MOST OF THE DESCRIBED TECHNIQUES IN HIP ARTHROSCOPY WORLDWIDE USE A PERINEAL POST, BUT IATROGENIC PUDENDAL NERVE, GENITAL LACERATIONS, HEMATOMAS, AND GROIN COMPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO OCCUR. IN LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, DISPOSABLE HIP PAD DEVICES ARE EXPENSIVE, AND NOT ALL THE ARTHROSCOPIC COMPANIES PROVIDE THEM. OUR YOGA MAT TECHNIQUE PROVIDES ENOUGH COUNTERTRACTION TO ACHIEVE ADEQUATE HIP DISTRACTION. LABRAL REPAIR, LABRAL RECONSTRUCTION, AND DECOMPRESSION OF FEMOROACETABULAR IMPINGEMENT SYNDROME HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED PROPERLY, RELIABLY, AND REPRODUCIBLY, AND NO TRENDELENBURG POSITION IS NEEDED. POSTLESS HIP ARTHROSCOPY IS MADE SIMPLE, AND POSITIONING THE PATIENT IS NOT DIFFICULT. HIP SURGEONS CAN ADAPT THIS TECHNIQUE TO A FRACTURE TABLE, A HIP DISTRACTOR, AND A STANDARD OPERATING ROOM TABLE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
2 1656  14 MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURIES RELATED TO YOGA: IMAGING OBSERVATIONS. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO DESCRIBE THE IMAGING APPEARANCES OF MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURIES RELATED TO YOGA. WE PERFORMED AN AUTOMATED SEARCH IN THE DATABASE OF A LARGE TERTIARY CARE CENTER AND CONDUCTED A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE IMAGING FINDINGS IN 38 PATIENTS OVER A 9-YEAR PERIOD. CONCLUSION: THE MOST FREQUENTLY ENCOUNTERED MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURIES WERE TENDINOUS LESIONS, INCLUDING TEARS OF THE SUPRASPINATUS, ACHILLES, AND PERONEUS BREVIS TENDONS AND FIBROCARTILAGINOUS TEARS INVOLVING THE MEDIAL MENISCUS, ACETABULAR LABRUM, GLENOID LABRUM, AND LUMBAR DISK WITH EXTRUSION.	2012

6 1736  20 PHOTO URTICARIA CAUSED BY EXPOSURE TO LED EMITTING 633-NM WAVELENGTH DURING HOT YOGA EXERCISE. PHOTO URTICARIA (PU) IS A RARE TYPE OF URTICARIA THAT DEVELOPS AFTER EXPOSURE TO VARIOUS WAVELENGTHS OF LIGHT. INDUCING URTICARIAL WHEALS USING LIGHT SOURCES OF PERTINENT WAVELENGTHS CAN HELP MAKE THE DEFINITIVE DIAGNOSIS OF PU. THE ACTION SPECTRA (AS) IN JAPANESE PATIENTS WITH PU COMMONLY FALL WITHIN THE ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION A AND VISIBLE LIGHT RANGE. HEREIN, TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, WE PRESENT THE FIRST CASE OF PU CAUSED BY 633-NM WAVELENGTH WITHIN THE VISIBLE LIGHT SPECTRUM. OUR PATIENT WORKED AS A "HOT YOGA" INSTRUCTOR, WHERE LIGHT-EMITTING DIODES (LEDS) ON THE CEILING WERE USED TO IRRADIATE THE ENTIRE ROOM WITH 633-NM WAVELENGTH OF LIGHT FOR "LIGHT TREATMENT." SHE REPORTED ITCHING AND WHEALS ON THE FACE AND NECK DURING HER "HOT YOGA" SESSIONS. "HOT YOGA" HAS RECENTLY GAINED POPULARITY GLOBALLY. THE "LIGHT TREATMENT" IS BASED ON THE THEORY THAT 633-NM WAVELENGTH LIGHT WITHIN THE VISIBLE LIGHT SPECTRUM REPORTEDLY PREVENTS THE SKIN FROM AGING. WE INDUCED WHEALS WITH ERYTHEMA BY IRRADIATING HER SKIN USING A 633-NM LED AT A DOSE OF 0.008 J/CM(2) /S FOR 1 H. HER CONDITION WAS DIAGNOSED AS PU CAUSED BY EXPOSURE TO 633 NM. LIGHT. HER SYMPTOMS HAVE NOT RECURRED SINCE SHE HAS AVOIDED BEING EXPOSED TO THE 633-NM WAVELENGTH OF LED LIGHT.	2021

8   49  14 A COMPARATIVE CLINICAL STUDY OF SHATAPATRAYADI CHURNA TABLET AND PATOLADI YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF AMLAPITTA. AMLAPITTA IS A VERY COMMON DISEASE CAUSED BY VIDAGDHA PITTA WITH FEATURES SUCH AS AMLODGARA, HRID KANTHA DAHA, AND AVIPAKA. THIS IS A BURNING PROBLEM OF THE SOCIETY. IRREGULAR AND IMPROPER FOOD HABITS, AND BUSY STRESSFUL LIFESTYLE IS ONE OF THE MAIN CULPRIT. AMLAPITTA IS THE GI DISORDER DESCRIBED IN AYURVEDIC TEXTS THAT CLOSELY RESEMBLES WITH GASTRITIS IN MODERN SCIENCE. IN CHRONIC STAGE, IT MAY LEAD TO ULCERATIVE CONDITIONS. IN THIS STUDY, TOTAL 41 PATIENTS WERE REGISTERED AND WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS. IN GROUP A, SHATAPATRAYADICHURNA TABLET AND IN GROUP B PATOLADI YOGA TABLET WERE GIVEN FOR 1 MONTH. THE NIDANA, SIGNS, AND SYMPTOMS WERE OBSERVED CAREFULLY TO GET IDEA ABOUT THE SAMPRAPTI OF THE DISEASE. THE EFFECT OF PATOLADI YOGA ON ROGA BALA IS 65.79%, 62.11% ON AGNI BALA, AND 63.35% ON DEHA AND CHETASA BALA. THE OVERALL RELIEF WAS 63.75%. THE EFFECT OF SHATAPATRAYADI TABLET ON ROGA BALA WAS 71.94%, 73.15% ON AGNI BALA, AND 77.68% ON DEHA AND CHETAS BALA. THE OVERALL RELIEF WAS 74.25%.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
9 1819  16 PROTEIN YOGA: CONFORMATIONAL VERSATILITY OF THE HEMOLYSIN II C-TERMINAL DOMAIN DETAILED BY NMR STRUCTURES FOR MULTIPLE STATES. THE C-TERMINAL DOMAIN OF BACILLUS CEREUS HEMOLYSIN II (HLYIIC), STABILIZES THE TRANS-MEMBRANE-PORE FORMED BY THE HLYII TOXIN AND MAY AID IN TARGET CELL RECOGNITION. INITIAL EFFORTS TO DETERMINE THE NMR STRUCTURE OF HLYIIC WERE HAMPERED BY CIS/TRANS ISOMERIZATION ABOUT THE SINGLE PROLINE AT POSITION 405 THAT LEADS TO DOUBLING OF NMR RESONANCES. WE USED THE MUTANT P405M-HLYIIC THAT ELIMINATES THE CIS PROLINE TO DETERMINE THE NMR STRUCTURE OF THE DOMAIN, WHICH REVEALED A NOVEL FOLD. HERE, WE EXTEND EARLIER STUDIES TO THE NMR STRUCTURE DETERMINATION OF THE CIS AND TRANS STATES OF WT-HLYIIC THAT EXIST SIMULTANEOUSLY IN SOLUTION. THE PRIMARY STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CIS AND TRANS STATES ARE IN THE LOOP THAT CONTAINS P405, AND STRUCTURALLY ADJACENT LOOPS. THERMODYNAMIC LINKAGE ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT AT 25 C THE CIS PROLINE, WHICH ALREADY HAS A LARGE FRACTION OF 20% IN THE UNFOLDED PROTEIN, INCREASES TO 50% IN THE FOLDED STATE DUE TO COUPLING WITH THE GLOBAL STABILITY OF THE DOMAIN. THE P405M OR P405A SUBSTITUTIONS ELIMINATE HETEROGENEITY DUE TO PROLINE ISOMERIZATION BUT LEAD TO THE FORMATION OF A NEW DIMERIC SPECIES. THE NMR STRUCTURE OF THE DIMER SHOWS THAT IT IS FORMED THROUGH DOMAIN-SWAPPING OF STRAND BETA5, THE LAST SEGMENT OF SECONDARY STRUCTURE FOLLOWING P405. THE PRESENCE OF P405 IN WT-HLYIIC STRONGLY DISFAVORS THE DIMER COMPARED TO THE P405M-HLYIIC OR P405A-HLYIIC MUTANTS. THE WT PROLINE MAY THUS ACT AS A "GATEKEEPER," WARDING OFF AGGREGATIVE MISFOLDING.	2021	
                                                        
10 2694  18 YOGA INDUCED ACUTE ULNAR NERVE COMPRESSION BY A GANGLION CYST IN GUYON'S CANAL. ACUTE ULNAR NEUROPATHY AT THE WRIST CAN BE DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE, AS IT IS AN UNCOMMON NEUROPATHY WITH VARIABLE CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS AND NUMEROUS ETIOLOGIES. WE PRESENT A CASE OF ACUTE ULNAR NEUROPATHY OF THE DEEP MOTOR BRANCH CAUSED BY A GANGLION CYST IN GUYON'S CANAL. INTERESTINGLY, THIS CASE OF ACUTE LOSS OF MOTOR FUNCTION OCCURRED AFTER THE PATIENT PARTICIPATED IN YOGA (SPECIFICALLY THE DOWNWARD DOG POSITION), AND RESOLVED SPONTANEOUSLY OVER TIME AFTER STOPPING YOGA, WITHOUT SURGICAL EXCISION OF THE GANGLION, SUGGESTING EXACERBATION OR PROTRUSION OF AN OCCULT GANGLION CYST DUE TO INCREASED ACTIVITY AND COMPRESSION OF THE HYPOTHENAR EMINENCE.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
11 2289   8 THE YOGA OF RAG GTPASES: DYNAMIC STRUCTURAL POSES CONFER AMINO ACID SENSING BY MTORC1. HETERODIMERIC RAG GTPASES PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN RELAYING FLUCTUATING LEVELS OF CELLULAR AMINO ACIDS TO THE SENSOR MECHANISTIC TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN COMPLEX 1. IMPORTANT MECHANISTIC QUESTIONS REMAIN UNRESOLVED, HOWEVER, REGARDING HOW GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE BINDING ENABLES RAG GTPASES TO TRANSITION DYNAMICALLY BETWEEN DISTINCT YOGA-LIKE STRUCTURAL POSES THAT CONTROL ACTIVATION STATE. EGRI AND SHEN IDENTIFIED A CRITICAL INTERDOMAIN HYDROGEN BOND WITHIN RAGA AND RAGC THAT STABILIZES THEIR GDP-BOUND STATES.

13   52  20 A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF BILVADI YOGA ASHCHYOTANA AND EYE DROPS IN VATAJA ABHISHYANDA (SIMPLE ALLERGIC CONJUNCTIVITIS). SIMPLE ALLERGIC CONJUNCTIVITIS IS THE MOST COMMON FORM OF OCULAR ALLERGY (PREVALENCE 5 - 22 %). IT IS A HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTION TO SPECIFIC AIRBORNE ANTIGENS. THE DISEASE VATAJA ABHISHYANDA, WHICH IS DUE TO VITIATION OF VATA PRADHANA TRIDOSHA IS COMPARABLE WITH THIS CONDITION. THE MANAGEMENT OF SIMPLE ALLERGIC CONJUNCTIVITIS IN MODERN OPHTHALMOLOGY IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND IT SHOULD BE FOLLOWED LIFELONG AND AYURVEDA CAN PROVIDE BETTER RELIEF IN SUCH MANIFESTATION. THIS IS THE FIRST RESEARCH STUDY ON VATAJA ABHISHYANDA. PATIENTS WERE SELECTED FROM THE OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENT (OPD), INPATIENT DEPARTMENT (IPD), OF THE SHALAKYA TANTRA DEPARTMENT AND WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS. IN GROUP-A BILVADI ASHCHYOTANA AND IN GROUP-B BILVADI EYE DROPS WERE INSTILLED FOR THREE MONTHS. TOTAL 32 PATIENTS WERE REGISTERED AND 27 PATIENTS COMPLETED THE COURSE OF TREATMENT. BILVADI ASHCHYOTANA GAVE BETTER RESULTS IN TODA, SANGHARSHA, PARUSHYA, KANDU AND RAGATA AS COMPARED WITH BILVADI EYE DROPS IN VATAJA ABHISHYANDA.	2012

OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, NUCLEOSIDES HAVE MAINTAINED A PROMINENT ROLE AS ONE OF THE CORNERSTONES OF ANTIVIRAL AND ANTICANCER THERAPEUTICS, AND MANY APPROACHES TO NUCLEOSIDE DRUG DESIGN HAVE BEEN PURSUED. ONE SUCH APPROACH INVOLVES FLEXIBILITY IN THE SUGAR MOIETY OF NUCLEOSIDES, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL ANTI-HIV AND HBV DRUG TENOFOVIR. IN CONTRAST, INTRODUCTION OF FLEXIBILITY TO THE NUCLEOBASE SCAFFOLD HAS ONLY MORE RECENTLY GAINED SIGNIFICANCE WITH THE INVENTION OF OUR FLEXIMERS.

17 1674  13 NURTURING THE FEMALE BODY: NOTIONS OF WELLBEING IN WOMB YOGA. ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES WHICH AIM TO ENHANCE WOMEN'S WELLBEING HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF CONTRIBUTING TO HEALTHIST AND POSTFEMINIST AGENDAS WHICH REST UPON A NEOLIBERAL LOGIC. I CRITICALLY ENGAGE WITH THIS ISSUE HERE THROUGH AN ETHNOGRAPHIC STUDY OF WOMB YOGA, A WOMEN'S ALTERNATIVE THERAPY DEVELOPED IN THE UK. I ARGUE THAT WHILE BEING COMMERCIAL AND EMPHASIZING PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY, WOMB YOGA LARGELY WORKS AGAINST THE CURRENT NEOLIBERAL OPTIMIZATION IDEAL. WOMB YOGA PRACTITIONERS DISMISS GOAL-ORIENTED SELF-MANAGEMENT AND DISCIPLINE, AND AVOID A SIMPLE REPRODUCTION OF GENDER STEREOTYPES BY DEFLECTING CARE AWAY FROM OTHER-DIRECTEDNESS AND OPENING THE INTERPRETATION OF FEMININITY TO THE IMAGINATIVE AND EXPERIENTIAL REALMS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
18 1416  17 IMPORTANCE OF MANAS TATTVA: A SEARCHLIGHT IN YOGA DARSHANA. SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL 'MANAS' HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF CURIOSITY FOR SCHOLARS, SCIENTISTS AND PHILOSOPHERS. THE REASON BEHIND THIS CURIOSITY IS ITS IMPORTANCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MANKIND. HUMAN BEING IS SUPERIOR TO OTHER CREATURES IN THE SERIES OF DEVELOPMENT. THIS SUPREMACY OF MAN REMAINS IN HIS QUALITY TO WORK AFTER THINKING, WHICH IS THE FUNCTION OF 'MANAS'. NO OTHER ANIMAL IS CAPABLE TO THINK LOGICALLY. THIS IS THE ONLY REASON WHICH LEADS THE MANKIND TO THE CREST OF DEVELOPMENT IN EVERY ASPECT. TO HIGHLIGHT THE CONCEPT OF MANAS IN YOGA DARSHANA, INFORMATION EXTRACTED FROM YOGA LITERATURES AND AYURVEDIC SAMHITAS. IN INDIAN CULTURE MIND HAS BEEN DESCRIBED FROM VARIOUS ANGLES. VEDIC, PHILOSOPHICAL AND AYURVEDIC LITERATURES HAVE A VAST AND EXCLUSIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANAS. PHILOSOPHERS EITHER ASTIKA OR NASTIKA HAVE DESCRIBED MANAS SIDDHANTA VIVIDLY. THOUGH MANY KINDS OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINIONS ARE THERE, YOGA DARSHANA ACCEPT THE IMPORTANCE OF MIND IN THE PROCESS OF PERCEPTION AND EVEN FOR THE BIRTH OF ANY INDIVIDUAL.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
19  379   7 BASILAR ARTERY OCCLUSION FOLLOWING YOGA EXERCISE: A CASE REPORT. BASILAR ARTERY OCCLUSION DEVELOPED IN A 34 YEAR OLD WOMAN 2 MONTHS AFTER ADOPTING UNUSUAL NECK POSTURES DURING YOGA PRACTICE. ON ANGIOGRAPHY, HER BASILAR ARTERY WAS FILLED WITH INTRALUMINAL CLOT WHILE THE VERTEBRAL ARTERIES WERE NORMAL. WE POSTULATE THAT A SEVERE REDUCTION IN BLOOD FLOW AND POSSIBLY AN INTIMAL TEAR TRIGGERED THROMBOSIS OF THE VERTEBRAL ARTERY AND THAT THE FINAL STROKE MECHANISM WAS ARTERY-TO-ARTERY EMBOLISM.	1993	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
20 2873  20 YOGA-INDUCED MYOSITIS OSSIFICANS TRAUMATICA OF THE SCAPHOLUNATE LIGAMENT. BACKGROUND MYOSITIS OSSIFICANS TRAUMATICA (MOT) INVOLVES THE HETEROTOPIC DEVELOPMENT OF LAMELLAR BONE AFTER A TRAUMATIC INJURY. DESPITE BEING TERMED "MYOSITIS," MOT IS NOT LIMITED TO MUSCLE BUT RATHER CAN INVOLVE TENDONS, FAT, AND FASCIA. "TRAUMATICA" REFLECTS THAT LESIONS ARE USUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH A HISTORY OF SIGNIFICANT TRAUMA, THAT IS, FRACTURES OR SURGERY; HOWEVER, MANY REPORTS SUGGEST THEY CAN ALSO BE LINKED TO REPETITIVE LOW-ENERGY INSULTS. IN BOTH CASES, THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE SECONDARY TO TISSUE INJURY GENERATES A PROLIFERATIVE OSTEOBLASTIC CASCADE. CASE DESCRIPTION WE PRESENT A CASE OF PERSISTENT WRIST PAIN IN A 43-YEAR-OLD WOMAN ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA ACTIVITIES. HER RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES DEMONSTRATED PARTIAL SCAPHOLUNATE (SL) LIGAMENT TEAR AND AN ASSOCIATED MASS LESION. SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REVEALED MOT INVOLVING THE SL LIGAMENT. LITERATURE REVIEW MOT LESIONS IN THE UPPER EXTREMITY ARE USUALLY LOCALIZED AROUND THE ELBOW, AND CASES IN THE HAND ARE RELATIVELY RARE. THERE ARE NO PRIOR REPORTS OF OCCURRENCES WITHIN THE WRIST JOINT OR IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE SL LIGAMENT. HOWEVER, BIOMECHANICAL STUDIES HAVE QUANTIFIED SIGNIFICANT MECHANICAL STRAINS ACROSS THE SL INTERVAL DURING VARIOUS YOGA POSES. THIS PATTERN OF MICROTRAUMA IS CAPABLE OF GENERATING MOT. CLINICAL RELEVANCE UPPER EXTREMITY WEIGHT-BEARING POSITIONS ARE COMMON IN YOGA AND SUBJECT THE WRIST, ESPECIALLY THE SL INTERVAL, TO HIGH MECHANICAL STRAINS. THIS PATTERN OF MICROTRAUMA SHOULD LEAD THE CLINICIAN TO SUSPECT MOT WHEN ENCOUNTERING A MASS IN THE WRIST, BUT MALIGNANCY AND INFECTION MUST BE RULED OUT.	2019

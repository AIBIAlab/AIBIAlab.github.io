1 1546 72 LATE ANTERIOR PROSTHETIC HIP DISLOCATION DUE TO YOGA. THE POPULARITY OF YOGA AND THE PREVALENCE OF TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY (THA) HAVE SIMULTANEOUSLY INCREASED IN THE UNITED STATES. ACCORDINGLY, ONE CAN ASSUME THAT THE NUMBER OF THA PATIENTS PRACTICING YOGA HAS INCREASED. CERTAIN YOGA POSES REACH THE EXTREMES OF HIP RANGE OF MOTION, POTENTIALLY LEAVING PATIENTS VULNERABLE TO DISLOCATION. TO DATE, 2 CASES OF LATE POSTERIOR PROSTHETIC HIP DISLOCATIONS DURING YOGA HAVE BEEN REPORTED; HOWEVER, THERE HAVE BEEN NO REPORTS OF ANTERIOR PROSTHETIC HIP DISLOCATIONS. WE PRESENT ONE CASE OF LATE ANTERIOR PROSTHETIC HIP DISLOCATION DURING YOGA IN A PATIENT WHO UNDERWENT THA VIA THE DIRECT ANTERIOR APPROACH. PROSTHETIC HIP DISLOCATION DURING YOGA MAY BE A GROWING CONCERN. WE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THA PATIENTS TO SAFELY PRACTICE YOGA.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
2 1547 38 LATE TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY DISLOCATION DUE TO YOGA. YOGA HAS BECOME A POPULAR FORM OF EXERCISE, RECREATION, AND MEDITATION FOR ADULTS IN THE UNITED STATES. AS THE POPULARITY OF BOTH YOGA AND THE INCIDENCE OF HIP REPLACEMENTS HAVE BOTH COINCIDENTALLY INCREASED OVER THE LAST 2 DECADES, WE IMAGINE THAT THE NUMBER OF TOTAL HIP REPLACEMENT PATIENTS PARTAKING IN THE PRACTICE OF YOGA HAS ALSO INCREASED. THERE ARE NO CLEAR GUIDELINES AVAILABLE FOR YOGA PRACTICE FOLLOWING HIP REPLACEMENT. TO DATE, THERE HAVE BEEN NO PUBLISHED REPORTS OF PROSTHETIC HIP DISLOCATIONS DURING YOGA. WE PRESENT 2 CASES OF LATE TOTAL HIP DISLOCATIONS DURING YOGA AND PROVIDE A REVIEW OF THE AVAILABLE ORTHOPAEDIC LITERATURE AND OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ON PATIENT RESTRICTIONS AND EDUCATION WITH RESPECT TO PRACTICING YOGA AFTER A HIP REPLACEMENT.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
3   79 14 A LOW-ENERGY FEMORAL SHAFT FRACTURE FROM PERFORMING A YOGA POSTURE. THE FEMORAL SHAFT IS RARELY THE SITE OF A LOW-ENERGY FRACTURE IN A HEALTHY INDIVIDUAL. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE FRACTURES ARE DUE TO MAJOR TRAUMA SUCH AS MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENTS. ALTHOUGH LOW-ENERGY FEMORAL SHAFT FRACTURES DO OCCUR, THEY ARE TYPICALLY IN PATIENTS WITH OSTEOPOROTIC BONE, OR PROSTHESIS RELATED. IN THIS CASE REPORT, WE PRESENT A MAN IN HIS LATE 30S WHO WAS PRACTISING A SPECIFIC YOGA STANCE WHEN HE EXPERIENCED A FEMORAL SHAFT FRACTURE.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
4 1991 23 SPINE FUSIONS, YOGA INSTRUCTORS, AND HIP FRACTURES: THE ROLE OF DUAL MOBILITY IN PRIMARY TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY. BACKGROUND: DESPITE THE INCREASED USE OF DUAL MOBILITY (DM) IN PRIMARY TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY (THA), DEBATE EXISTS REGARDING THE INDICATIONS FOR ITS USE. NO SPECIFIC ALGORITHM EXISTS TO GUIDE THIS DECISION-MAKING PROCESS. THEREFORE, THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO SUMMARIZE THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE LITERATURE REGARDING THE USE OF DM IN PRIMARY THA AND PROVIDE EVIDENCE-BASED GUIDELINES BASED ON SPECIFIC PATIENT POPULATIONS AND RISK FACTORS FOR INSTABILITY. METHODS: WE REVIEWED THE CURRENT LITERATURE FOR STUDIES EVALUATING RISK FACTORS FOR DISLOCATION IN PRIMARY THA, AS WELL AS THE CLINICAL USE AND RESULTS OF DM IN PRIMARY THA. BASED ON THE STRENGTH OF THE LITERATURE, WE DISCUSS THE USE OF DM IN SPECIFIC PATIENT POPULATIONS. WE PROVIDE A DECISION-MAKING ALGORITHM TO DETERMINE WHETHER A PATIENT MAY BE INDICATED FOR DM IN PRIMARY THA. RESULTS: SURGEONS SHOULD CONSIDER PREOPERATIVE PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS, RISK FACTORS FOR INSTABILITY (EG, SIGNIFICANT HIP-SPINE ISSUES), TYPE OF PROCEDURE TO BE PERFORMED (EG, CONVERSION ARTHROPLASTY), AND INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY (EG, THA FOR FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE). BASED ON THIS ALGORITHMIC ASSESSMENT, DM MAY BE WARRANTED IN THE PRIMARY THA SETTING IF A PATIENT'S COMBINED RISK REACHES AN ESTABLISHED THRESHOLD BASED ON THE LITERATURE. CONCLUSION: THIS EVIDENCE-BASED ALGORITHM MAY HELP GUIDE CURRENT PRACTICE IN THE USE OF DM IN PRIMARY THA. WE ADVOCATE THE CONTINUED JUDICIOUS USE OF DM IN HIP ARTHROPLASTY. LONGER TERM STUDIES ARE NEEDED IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE DURABILITY OF DM, AS WELL AS ANY COMPLICATIONS RELATED TO THE DM ARTICULATION.	2021	

5 2288 18 THE YOGA MAT TECHNIQUE IN POSTLESS HIP ARTHROSCOPY. HIP ARTHROSCOPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF FEMOROACETABULAR IMPINGEMENT SYNDROME WITH ANTI-SLIDING TECHNIQUES AND WITHOUT THE USE OF A PERINEAL POST TO ACHIEVE HIP DISTRACTION HAS INCREASED GREATLY IN THE PAST 5 TO 10 YEARS. TO ACCESS THE HIP JOINT, DISTRACTION IS MANDATORY TO TREAT INTRA-ARTICULAR DISORDERS SUCH AS LABRAL TEARS, ACETABULAR CARTILAGE DEFECTS, LOOSE BODIES, LIGAMENTUM TERES TEARS, AND AVASCULAR NECROSIS OF THE HIP. IN HIP DISTRACTION, COUNTER-DISTRACTION IS NEEDED, AND THIS IS ACHIEVED WITH A BULKY AND CUSHIONED PERINEAL POST. MOST OF THE DESCRIBED TECHNIQUES IN HIP ARTHROSCOPY WORLDWIDE USE A PERINEAL POST, BUT IATROGENIC PUDENDAL NERVE, GENITAL LACERATIONS, HEMATOMAS, AND GROIN COMPLICATIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO OCCUR. IN LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES, DISPOSABLE HIP PAD DEVICES ARE EXPENSIVE, AND NOT ALL THE ARTHROSCOPIC COMPANIES PROVIDE THEM. OUR YOGA MAT TECHNIQUE PROVIDES ENOUGH COUNTERTRACTION TO ACHIEVE ADEQUATE HIP DISTRACTION. LABRAL REPAIR, LABRAL RECONSTRUCTION, AND DECOMPRESSION OF FEMOROACETABULAR IMPINGEMENT SYNDROME HAVE BEEN ACHIEVED PROPERLY, RELIABLY, AND REPRODUCIBLY, AND NO TRENDELENBURG POSITION IS NEEDED. POSTLESS HIP ARTHROSCOPY IS MADE SIMPLE, AND POSITIONING THE PATIENT IS NOT DIFFICULT. HIP SURGEONS CAN ADAPT THIS TECHNIQUE TO A FRACTURE TABLE, A HIP DISTRACTOR, AND A STANDARD OPERATING ROOM TABLE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
6 1656  9 MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURIES RELATED TO YOGA: IMAGING OBSERVATIONS. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO DESCRIBE THE IMAGING APPEARANCES OF MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURIES RELATED TO YOGA. WE PERFORMED AN AUTOMATED SEARCH IN THE DATABASE OF A LARGE TERTIARY CARE CENTER AND CONDUCTED A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE IMAGING FINDINGS IN 38 PATIENTS OVER A 9-YEAR PERIOD. CONCLUSION: THE MOST FREQUENTLY ENCOUNTERED MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURIES WERE TENDINOUS LESIONS, INCLUDING TEARS OF THE SUPRASPINATUS, ACHILLES, AND PERONEUS BREVIS TENDONS AND FIBROCARTILAGINOUS TEARS INVOLVING THE MEDIAL MENISCUS, ACETABULAR LABRUM, GLENOID LABRUM, AND LUMBAR DISK WITH EXTRUSION.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
7 2694 15 YOGA INDUCED ACUTE ULNAR NERVE COMPRESSION BY A GANGLION CYST IN GUYON'S CANAL. ACUTE ULNAR NEUROPATHY AT THE WRIST CAN BE DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE, AS IT IS AN UNCOMMON NEUROPATHY WITH VARIABLE CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS AND NUMEROUS ETIOLOGIES. WE PRESENT A CASE OF ACUTE ULNAR NEUROPATHY OF THE DEEP MOTOR BRANCH CAUSED BY A GANGLION CYST IN GUYON'S CANAL. INTERESTINGLY, THIS CASE OF ACUTE LOSS OF MOTOR FUNCTION OCCURRED AFTER THE PATIENT PARTICIPATED IN YOGA (SPECIFICALLY THE DOWNWARD DOG POSITION), AND RESOLVED SPONTANEOUSLY OVER TIME AFTER STOPPING YOGA, WITHOUT SURGICAL EXCISION OF THE GANGLION, SUGGESTING EXACERBATION OR PROTRUSION OF AN OCCULT GANGLION CYST DUE TO INCREASED ACTIVITY AND COMPRESSION OF THE HYPOTHENAR EMINENCE.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
8 2873 21 YOGA-INDUCED MYOSITIS OSSIFICANS TRAUMATICA OF THE SCAPHOLUNATE LIGAMENT. BACKGROUND MYOSITIS OSSIFICANS TRAUMATICA (MOT) INVOLVES THE HETEROTOPIC DEVELOPMENT OF LAMELLAR BONE AFTER A TRAUMATIC INJURY. DESPITE BEING TERMED "MYOSITIS," MOT IS NOT LIMITED TO MUSCLE BUT RATHER CAN INVOLVE TENDONS, FAT, AND FASCIA. "TRAUMATICA" REFLECTS THAT LESIONS ARE USUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH A HISTORY OF SIGNIFICANT TRAUMA, THAT IS, FRACTURES OR SURGERY; HOWEVER, MANY REPORTS SUGGEST THEY CAN ALSO BE LINKED TO REPETITIVE LOW-ENERGY INSULTS. IN BOTH CASES, THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE SECONDARY TO TISSUE INJURY GENERATES A PROLIFERATIVE OSTEOBLASTIC CASCADE. CASE DESCRIPTION WE PRESENT A CASE OF PERSISTENT WRIST PAIN IN A 43-YEAR-OLD WOMAN ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA ACTIVITIES. HER RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES DEMONSTRATED PARTIAL SCAPHOLUNATE (SL) LIGAMENT TEAR AND AN ASSOCIATED MASS LESION. SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REVEALED MOT INVOLVING THE SL LIGAMENT. LITERATURE REVIEW MOT LESIONS IN THE UPPER EXTREMITY ARE USUALLY LOCALIZED AROUND THE ELBOW, AND CASES IN THE HAND ARE RELATIVELY RARE. THERE ARE NO PRIOR REPORTS OF OCCURRENCES WITHIN THE WRIST JOINT OR IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE SL LIGAMENT. HOWEVER, BIOMECHANICAL STUDIES HAVE QUANTIFIED SIGNIFICANT MECHANICAL STRAINS ACROSS THE SL INTERVAL DURING VARIOUS YOGA POSES. THIS PATTERN OF MICROTRAUMA IS CAPABLE OF GENERATING MOT. CLINICAL RELEVANCE UPPER EXTREMITY WEIGHT-BEARING POSITIONS ARE COMMON IN YOGA AND SUBJECT THE WRIST, ESPECIALLY THE SL INTERVAL, TO HIGH MECHANICAL STRAINS. THIS PATTERN OF MICROTRAUMA SHOULD LEAD THE CLINICIAN TO SUSPECT MOT WHEN ENCOUNTERING A MASS IN THE WRIST, BUT MALIGNANCY AND INFECTION MUST BE RULED OUT.	2019

BASILAR ARTERY OCCLUSION DEVELOPED IN A 34 YEAR OLD WOMAN 2 MONTHS AFTER ADOPTING UNUSUAL NECK POSTURES DURING YOGA PRACTICE. ON ANGIOGRAPHY, HER BASILAR ARTERY WAS FILLED WITH INTRALUMINAL CLOT WHILE THE VERTEBRAL ARTERIES WERE NORMAL. WE POSTULATE THAT A SEVERE REDUCTION IN BLOOD FLOW AND POSSIBLY AN INTIMAL TEAR TRIGGERED THROMBOSIS OF THE VERTEBRAL ARTERY AND THAT THE FINAL STROKE MECHANISM WAS ARTERY-TO-ARTERY EMBOLISM.	1993	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
10 1757 22 POSITION OF THE HIP IN YOGA. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS GROWING IN POPULARITY AS A FORM OF EXERCISE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. ORTHOPEDIC PATIENTS PARTICIPATE IN YOGA, YET LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE RANGES-OF-MOTION OF THE HIP WITHIN VARIOUS YOGA POSES. ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS ARE UNSURE ABOUT WHAT POTENTIAL POSITIONS THEIR PATIENTS ARE PLACING THEIR HIPS DURING A YOGA PRACTICE. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO QUANTIFY THE DEGREE OF HIP MOTION WITH COMMON YOGA POSES. METHODS: TWENTY HEALTHY, REGULAR PRACTITIONERS OF YOGA PERFORMED 11 DIFFERENT YOGA POSES IN A STANDARDIZED FASHION. MOTION ANALYSIS WAS USED TO CAPTURE RANGE-OF-MOTION OF THE HIP DURING EACH POSE. RESULTS: MANY YOGA POSES PUT THE HIP IN EXTREMES OF MOTION. POSES SUCH AS DOWNWARD DOG, FORWARD FOLD, SEATED TWIST, AND PIGEON STRESSED THE HIP IN FLEXION. WARRIOR 1, WARRIOR 2, CRESCENT LUNGE, PIGEON, AND TRIANGLE STRESSED THE HIP IN EXTENSION. EAGLE AND SEATED TWIST PUT THE HIP IN HIGHER ADDUCTION, WHILE HALF MOON, EAGLE, AND TRIANGLE PRODUCED MORE HIP INTERNAL ROTATION. CONCLUSION: MANY POSES WERE FOUND TO REACH EXTREMES OF HIP MOTION. THIS STUDY MAY HELP GUIDE THE ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON IN COUNSELING HIP ARTHROPLASTY AND HIP IMPINGEMENT PATIENTS ABOUT YOGA-RELATED ACTIVITY. BY KNOWING WHICH POSES POTENTIALLY STRESS THE HIP IN PARTICULAR PLANES OF MOTION, SURGEONS MAY BETTER INFORM THEIR PATIENTS WHO ARE RETURNING TO YOGA AFTER INJURY OR SURGERY.	2018

12 2911 19 [PSEUDOARTHROSIS OF THE FIRST RIB IN A PATIENT WHO PRACTICES YOGA. A CASE REPORT]. INTRODUCTION: PSEUDOARTHROSIS OF THE FIRST RIB IS A RARE CONDITION THAT MAY OCCUR IN ATHLETES AS A RESULT OF REPETITIVE ACTIVITIES, MAINLY OVERHEAD. THE USUAL CLINICAL PRESENTATION IS PAIN IN THE NECK OR THE IPSILATERAL SHOULDER. CASE REPORT: THIS IS THE CASE OF A 19-YEAR-OLD FEMALE PATIENT WHO HAD SUDDEN PAIN OF THE BASE OF THE NECK WHILE DOING YOGA. PSEUDOARTHROSIS OF THE FIRST RIB WAS DIAGNOSED WITH X-RAYS AND CAT SCAN. TREATMENT CONSISTED OF A REHABILITATION AND PHYSICAL THERAPY PROGRAM THAT WAS SUCCESSFUL DESPITE THE PERSISTENCE OF THE PSEUDOARTHROSIS. DISCUSSION: CASES OF FIRST RIB FRACTURES HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN ATHLETES PRACTICING MULTIPLE ACTIVITIES; HOWEVER, PSEUDOARTHROSIS CASES ARE RARE SINCE MOST OF THEM PROGRESS TO BONE HEALING. THIS IS THE FIRST REPORTED CASE OF A FRACTURE OR PSEUDOARTHROSIS IN A PATIENT PRACTICING YOGA. AS IN MOST REPORTED CASES, CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT WAS SUCCESSFUL. CONCLUSION: FRACTURES AND PSEUDOARTHROSIS OF THE FIRST RIB ARE RARE IN ATHLETES AND SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF ATHLETES PRESENTING WITH SHOULDER AND NECK PAIN. CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT IS SUCCESSFUL IN MOST CASES.	2009

16 1614 12 MIND AND CONSCIOUSNESS IN YOGA - VEDANTA: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WITH WESTERN PSYCHOLOGICAL CONCEPTS. STUDY OF MIND AND CONSCIOUSNESS THROUGH ESTABLISHED SCIENTIFIC METHODS IS OFTEN DIFFICULT DUE TO THE OBSERVED-OBSERVER DICHOTOMY. CARTESIAN APPROACH OF DUALISM CONSIDERING THE MIND AND MATTER AS TWO DIVERSE AND UNCONNECTED ENTITIES HAS BEEN QUESTIONED BY ORIENTAL SCHOOLS OF YOGA AND VEDANTA AS WELL AS THE RECENT QUANTUM THEORIES OF MODERN PHYSICS. FREUDIAN AND NEO-FREUDIAN SCHOOLS BASED ON THE CARTESIAN MODEL HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED BY THE HUMANISTIC SCHOOLS WHICH COME MUCH CLOSER TO THE VEDANTIC APPROACH OF UNITARINESS. A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE TWO APPROACHES IS DISCUSSED.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
17 1906 26 RETURNING TO YOGA PRACTICE AND TEACHING AFTER TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY. PATIENTS WHO PRACTICE YOGA ARE MOTIVATED TO RETURN TO PRACTICE AFTER TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY (THA). WITH CASE REPORTS OF DISLOCATIONS DURING YOGA, THE SAFETY OF SUCH A RETURN IS UNCLEAR. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE TIMING AND FEASIBILITY OF A RETURN IN A SUBSET OF HIGHLY EXPERIENCED AND MOTIVATED PATIENTS. BETWEEN 2010 AND 2019, A TOTAL OF 19 THA'S PERFORMED IN 14 PATIENTS WHO SELF-IDENTIFIED AS YOGA INSTRUCTORS WERE RETROSPECTIVELY REVIEWED. PATIENTS WHO PRACTICED YOGA BUT WERE NOT TEACHERS WERE EXCLUDED FROM THIS SERIES. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES WERE THE ABILITY TO RETURN TO YOGA, TO RESUME TEACHING, AND FLUENCY WITH 14 CLASSIC POSES. SECONDARY OUTCOMES MEASURED WERE PATIENT-REPORTED HIP DISABILITY AND OSTEOARTHRITIS OUTCOME SCORE (HOOS, JR.), COMPLICATIONS, AND RADIOGRAPHIC POSITION OF THE IMPLANTS. AFTER SURGERY, ALL PATIENTS RETURNED TO PRACTICING AND TEACHING YOGA, AND THE MEAN TIME TO EACH WAS 2 MONTHS. ALL PATIENTS WERE ABLE TO PERFORM ALL 14 CLASSIC POSES. AT A MEAN FOLLOW-UP OF 5 YEARS (SD +/- 4), THERE WERE NO COMPLICATIONS, AND THE MEAN HOOS, JR SCORE WAS 92 POINTS (SD +/- 15). THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT A RETURN TO YOGA IN AN EXPERIENCED POPULATION IS NOT ONLY POSSIBLE BUT ALSO SAFE AFTER A DIRECT ANTERIOR THA. LIMITATIONS IN PERFORMING THE POSES SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD, AND APPROPRIATE MODIFICATIONS SHOULD BE INCORPORATED WHEN NEEDED.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
18 2809 13 YOGA THERAPY: BUILDING A HOLDING ENVIRONMENT FOR SOMATIC AND PSYCHE CHANGE. DRAWING ON IDEAS FROM D.W. WINNICOTT AND THE WORK OF QUAKER THEOLOGIAN PARKER PALMER, THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE CONCEPT OF A HOLDING ENVIRONMENT, ITS REFINED UNDERSTANDING IN THE LITERATURE OVER THE YEARS, AND HOW IT CAN BE OPTIMALLY USED IN YOGA THERAPY. THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT EFFECTIVELY ESTABLISHING A HOLDING ENVIRONMENT CAN FACILITATE BOTH SOMATIC AND DEEP STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN A CLIENT, FACILITATING HEALING FROM PRIMAL WOUNDING AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL RECONNECTION TO THE TRUE SELF.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
19  304 16 AN EPIDEMIOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF YOGA-RELATED INJURY PRESENTATIONS TO EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS IN AUSTRALIA. OBJECTIVES: DESPITE BEING CONSIDERED A LOW-INTENSITY EXERCISE, CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT THE RISK OF INJURIES ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA. THIS STUDY AIMED TO ANALYZE THE CHARACTERISTICS AND TREND OF YOGA-RELATED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT (ED) PRESENTATIONS FROM JULY 2009 TO JUNE 2016 IN VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA. METHODS: THE VICTORIAN EMERGENCY MINIMUM DATASET (VEMD) WAS USED TO COLLECT THE DE-IDENTIFIED DATA. THE DATA WERE FIRST ANALYZED USING DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS AND SPEARMAN'S CORRELATION. FURTHER INJURY TREND WAS ANALYZED BY CALCULATING THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE OF THE NUMBER OF YOGA-RELATED INJURIES DURING THE 7-YEAR STUDY PERIOD. RESULTS: THERE WERE 118 YOGA-RELATED INJURY CASES THAT SIGNIFICANTLY (P < .05) INCREASED BY 357% FROM JULY 2009 TO JUNE 2016. MOST OF THE CASES WERE FEMALE (N = 96; 81.4%) AND BETWEEN 20 AND 39 YEARS OLD (N = 68, 57.6%). MOST COMMON INJURIES COMPRISED DISLOCATIONS/SPRAINS/STRAINS (N = 60, 51.7%) FOLLOWED BY FRACTURES (N = 17, 14.4%), AND INJURY TO MUSCLE/TENDON (N = 15, 12.7%). CONCLUSION: THE FINDINGS WARRANT FUTURE NATIONWIDE RESEARCH AS WELL AS AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES OF YOGA SERVICE PROVIDERS TO MINIMIZE THE RISK OF INJURY.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
20 1416 14 IMPORTANCE OF MANAS TATTVA: A SEARCHLIGHT IN YOGA DARSHANA. SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL 'MANAS' HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF CURIOSITY FOR SCHOLARS, SCIENTISTS AND PHILOSOPHERS. THE REASON BEHIND THIS CURIOSITY IS ITS IMPORTANCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MANKIND. HUMAN BEING IS SUPERIOR TO OTHER CREATURES IN THE SERIES OF DEVELOPMENT. THIS SUPREMACY OF MAN REMAINS IN HIS QUALITY TO WORK AFTER THINKING, WHICH IS THE FUNCTION OF 'MANAS'. NO OTHER ANIMAL IS CAPABLE TO THINK LOGICALLY. THIS IS THE ONLY REASON WHICH LEADS THE MANKIND TO THE CREST OF DEVELOPMENT IN EVERY ASPECT. TO HIGHLIGHT THE CONCEPT OF MANAS IN YOGA DARSHANA, INFORMATION EXTRACTED FROM YOGA LITERATURES AND AYURVEDIC SAMHITAS. IN INDIAN CULTURE MIND HAS BEEN DESCRIBED FROM VARIOUS ANGLES. VEDIC, PHILOSOPHICAL AND AYURVEDIC LITERATURES HAVE A VAST AND EXCLUSIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANAS. PHILOSOPHERS EITHER ASTIKA OR NASTIKA HAVE DESCRIBED MANAS SIDDHANTA VIVIDLY. THOUGH MANY KINDS OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINIONS ARE THERE, YOGA DARSHANA ACCEPT THE IMPORTANCE OF MIND IN THE PROCESS OF PERCEPTION AND EVEN FOR THE BIRTH OF ANY INDIVIDUAL.	2014

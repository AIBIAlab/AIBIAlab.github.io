1 1974 117 SILVER YOGA EXERCISES IMPROVED PHYSICAL FITNESS OF TRANSITIONAL FRAIL ELDERS. BACKGROUND: PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF TRANSITIONAL FRAIL ELDERS (E.G., THROUGH THERAPEUTIC-BASED YOGA EXERCISES) IS ESSENTIAL TO REDUCE HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES CAUSED BY CHRONIC HEALTH PROBLEMS. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF 24 WEEKS OF THE SENIOR-TAILORED SILVER YOGA (SY) EXERCISE PROGRAM FOR TRANSITIONAL FRAIL ELDERS. METHODS: A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF 69 ELDERS IN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES WERE ASSIGNED RANDOMLY TO THE SY GROUP (N = 38) OR TO THE CONTROL GROUP (N = 31) ON THE BASIS OF THE FACILITIES WHERE THEY RESIDED, AND 55 OF THEM COMPLETED THIS QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL PRETEST AND POSTTEST STUDY. INTERVENTION WAS CONDUCTED THREE TIMES PER WEEK, 70 MINUTES PER SESSION, FOR 24 WEEKS. PHYSICAL FITNESS (BODY COMPOSITION, CARDIOVASCULAR-RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS, BODY FLEXIBILITY, MUSCLE POWER AND ENDURANCE, BALANCE, AND AGILITY) WERE EXAMINED AT BASELINE, AT 12 WEEKS, AND AT THE END OF THE 24TH WEEK OF THE STUDY. RESULTS: AT THE END OF THE STUDY, THE PHYSICAL FITNESS INDICATORS OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE SY GROUP HAD IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY, AND THEY HAD BETTER PHYSICAL FITNESS THAN PARTICIPANTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP (ALL P VALUES < .05). DISCUSSION: IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT THE SY EXERCISES BE INCORPORATED AS AN ACTIVITY PROGRAM IN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES TO PROMOTE THE PHYSICAL FITNESS OF TRANSITIONAL FRAIL ELDERS.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
2 1082  74 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SLEEP QUALITY AND DEPRESSION IN ELDERS IN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES. BACKGROUND: BEING RELOCATED TO AN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY CAN RESULT IN SLEEP DISTURBANCES AND DEPRESSION IN ELDERS. THIS MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO OR WORSENED BY LACK OF REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. APPROPRIATE EXERCISE PROGRAMS MAY BE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF QUALITY OF LIFE IN THIS GROUP OF TRANSITIONAL FRAIL ELDERS. PURPOSE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO TEST THE EFFECTS OF A 6-MONTH YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM IN IMPROVING SLEEP QUALITY AND DECREASING DEPRESSION IN TRANSITIONAL FRAIL ELDERS LIVING IN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES. METHODS: A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL PRETEST-AND-POSTTEST DESIGN WAS USED. A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF 69 ELDERLY RESIDENTS OF ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES WAS DIVIDED RANDOMLY INTO A YOGA EXERCISE (N = 38) AND CONTROL GROUP (N = 31) BASED ON RESIDENCE LOCATION. A TOTAL OF 55 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE STUDY. THE INTERVENTION WAS IMPLEMENTED IN THREE SMALL GROUPS, AND EACH PRACTICE GROUP WAS LED BY TWO PRETRAINED CERTIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTORS THREE TIMES PER WEEK AT 70 MIN PER PRACTICE SESSION FOR 24 WEEKS. THE OUTCOME MEASURES OF SLEEP QUALITY (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX) AND DEPRESSION STATE (TAIWANESE DEPRESSION QUESTIONNAIRE) WERE EXAMINED AT BASELINE, AT THE 12TH WEEK, AND AT THE 24TH WEEK OF THE STUDY. RESULTS: AFTER 6 MONTHS OF PERFORMING YOGA EXERCISES, PARTICIPANTS' OVERALL SLEEP QUALITY HAD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED, WHEREAS DEPRESSION, SLEEP DISTURBANCES, AND DAYTIME DYSFUNCTION HAD DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (P < .05). IN ADDITION, PARTICIPANTS IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP HAD BETTER RESULTS ON ALL OUTCOME INDICATORS THAN THOSE OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOGA EXERCISE BE INCORPORATED AS AN ACTIVITY PROGRAM IN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES OR IN OTHER LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES TO IMPROVE SLEEP QUALITY AND DECREASE DEPRESSION IN INSTITUTIONALIZED ELDERS.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
3 1742  72 PHYSICAL FITNESS OF OLDER ADULTS IN SENIOR ACTIVITY CENTRES AFTER 24-WEEK SILVER YOGA EXERCISES. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: PROMOTING PHYSICAL FITNESS OF YOUNG-OLDER ADULTS IS ESSENTIAL IN REDUCING HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES WHICH WOULD OCCUR IN THE FUTURE FOR THOSE WITH CHRONIC HEALTH PROBLEMS. THE SILVER YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAMME WAS DEVELOPED TO ACCOMMODATE THE REDUCED BODY FLEXIBILITY EXPERIENCED BY MANY OLDER ADULTS AND WAS CRITICALLY REVIEWED BY EXPERTS AND PILOT-TESTED WITH COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS. THIS STUDY AIMED TO TEST OLDER ADULTS' PHYSICAL FITNESS AFTER A 24-WEEK SILVER YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAMME AND TO EXAMINE WHETHER THE PROGRAMME COULD BE FURTHER SHORTENED TO FIT SENIOR ACTIVITY CENTRES' PROGRAMME DESIGNS. DESIGN: A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL, PRE-POST TESTS DESIGN WAS USED: BASELINE, AT 12-WEEK AND AT 24-WEEK PERIODS. METHODS: CONVENIENCE SAMPLES OF 204 SUBJECTS WERE RECRUITED FROM EIGHT SENIOR ACTIVITY CENTRES AND 176 SUBJECTS COMPLETED THE STUDY. SUBJECTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED INTO THREE GROUPS BASED ON THE CENTRES: (1) EXPERIMENT I: COMPLETE SILVER YOGA WITH STRETCHING AND MEDITATION, (2) EXPERIMENT II: SHORTENED SILVER YOGA WITHOUT THE GUIDED-IMAGERY MEDITATION AND (3) WAIT-LIST CONTROL. THE INTERVENTIONS WERE CONDUCTED THREE TIMES PER WEEK FOR 24 WEEKS. PHYSICAL FITNESS INDICATORS INCLUDED BODY COMPOSITIONS, CARDIOVASCULAR-RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS, PHYSICAL FUNCTIONS AND THE RANGE OF MOTION. RESULTS: AT THE END OF THE 24-WEEK PERIOD, THE PHYSICAL FITNESS OF SUBJECTS IN EXPERIMENTS I AND II HAD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED WHETHER OR NOT GUIDED-IMAGERY MEDITATION WAS USED AND ALL HAD BETTER PHYSICAL FITNESS THAN SUBJECTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP (ALL P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: THE PHYSICAL FITNESS OF OLDER ADULTS IN BOTH THE 70-MINUTE COMPLETE SILVER YOGA GROUP AND THE 55-MINUTE SHORTENED SILVER YOGA GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED AFTER THE INTERVENTIONS. IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT THE SILVER YOGA PROGRAMME BE SHORTENED BY ELIMINATING THE GUIDED-IMAGERY MEDITATION. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: THE SHORTENED SILVER YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAMME IS RECOMMENDED TO BE INCORPORATED AS AN ACTIVITY PROGRAMME IN COMMUNITY-SETTINGS TO PROMOTE THE PHYSICAL FITNESS OF OLDER ADULTS.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
4  502  36 COMMUNITY VS. INSTITUTIONAL ELDERS' EVALUATIONS OF AND PREFERENCES FOR YOGA EXERCISES. AIMS: TO EVALUATE AND COMPARE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE SILVER YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAMME FOR COMMUNITY AND INSTITUTIONAL ELDERS AND TO DETERMINE THEIR PREFERENCES TOWARDS YOGA EXERCISES. BACKGROUND: YOGA HAS BEEN USED TO PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF ELDERS. THE SILVER YOGA WAS DEVELOPED TO ACCOMMODATE THE PHYSICAL TOLERANCE AND BODY FLEXIBILITY OF ELDERS AND APPLIED TO COMMUNITY AND INSTITUTIONAL ELDERS WITH POSITIVE HEALTH PROMOTION BENEFITS. DESIGN: DESCRIPTIVE DESIGN WITH QUANTITATIVE PROGRAMME EVALUATION AND SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS. METHOD: A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF 97 PARTICIPANTS (64 COMMUNITY ELDERS; 33 INSTITUTIONAL ELDERS) WAS INTERVIEWED INDIVIDUALLY AFTER SIX MONTHS OF SILVER YOGA EXERCISES. PARTICIPANTS RATED THE LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY, ACCEPTABILITY, FEASIBILITY AND HELPFULNESS OF THE SILVER YOGA PROGRAMME (FOUR PHASES: WARM-UP, HATHA YOGA, RELAXATION AND GUIDED-IMAGERY MEDITATION) AND THE ABDOMINAL BREATHING TECHNIQUE, BASED ON A 10-POINT CANTRIL LADDER SCALE. FURTHER, PARTICIPANTS EXPRESSED THEIR PREFERENCES OF YOGA EXERCISES BASED ON FOUR OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS. RESULTS: THE PROGRAMME WAS FAIRLY ACCEPTABLE, FEASIBLE AND HELPFUL FOR COMMUNITY AND INSTITUTIONAL ELDERS (MEANS RANGED FROM 8.33-9.70). THE WARM-UP, RELAXATION, GUIDED-IMAGERY MEDITATION AND ABDOMINAL BREATHING ARE FAIRLY EASY TO FOLLOW AND PERFORM (MEANS RANGED FROM 0.20-0.94). HOWEVER, THE POSTURES IN HATHA YOGA PHASE WERE RELATIVELY CHALLENGING BUT STILL MANAGEABLE FOR THE INSTITUTIONAL ELDERS (MEAN = 1.97, SD 2.33). FURTHER, COMMUNITY ELDERS PREFERRED TO PRACTISE YOGA 61-90 MINUTES EVERYDAY IN A GROUP OF 11-20, WHILE THE INSTITUTIONAL ELDERS PREFERRED TO PRACTISE YOGA 31-60 MINUTES THREE TIMES PER WEEK, IN A GROUP OF <10. CONCLUSIONS: THE SILVER YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAMME IS ACCEPTABLE, FEASIBLE, HELPFUL AND MANAGEABLE FOR COMMUNITY AND INSTITUTIONAL ELDERS. HOWEVER, DIFFERENT EXERCISE PROTOCOLS, SUCH AS PRACTICE INTENSITY AND GROUP SIZE, COULD BE APPLIED TO DIFFERENT OLDER POPULATIONS. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: THE SILVER YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAMME COULD BE APPLIED TO BOTH COMMUNITY AND INSTITUTIONAL ELDERS TO PROMOTE THEIR HEALTH.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
5 1752  43 PILOT-TESTING THE EFFECTS OF A NEWLY-DEVELOPED SILVER YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM FOR FEMALE SENIORS. THIS STUDY AIMED TO PILOT-TEST THE HEALTH PROMOTION EFFECTS OF A SILVER YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM FOR FEMALE SENIORS. USING A ONE-GROUP, PRE-POST TEST DESIGN, A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF 16 COMMUNITY-DWELLING FEMALE SENIORS WAS RECRUITED. THE SILVER YOGA EXERCISE INTERVENTION WAS ADMINISTERED THREE TIMES A WEEK, 70 MINUTES PER SESSION, FOR FOUR WEEKS. DATA WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE AND AFTER COMPLETION OF THE FOUR-WEEK INTERVENTION. RESULTS INDICATED THAT PARTICIPANTS' BODY FAT PERCENTAGE AND SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE DECREASED, BALANCE AND RANGE OF MOTION ON SHOULDER FLEXION AND ABDUCTION IMPROVED, AND SLEEP DISTURBANCE WAS MINIMIZED (ALL P < .05). PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THAT THE SILVER YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM PROVIDES POSITIVE EFFECTS ON THE PROMOTION OF GOOD HEALTH IN FEMALE SENIORS LIVING IN THE COMMUNITIES.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
6  996  46 EFFECTS OF INSPIRATORY MUSCLE TRAINING AND YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES ON RESPIRATORY MUSCLE FUNCTION IN INSTITUTIONALIZED FRAIL OLDER ADULTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: IN OLDER ADULTS, RESPIRATORY FUNCTION MAY BE SERIOUSLY COMPROMISED WHEN A MARKED DECREASE OF RESPIRATORY MUSCLE (RM) STRENGTH COEXISTS WITH COMORBIDITY AND ACTIVITY LIMITATION. RESPIRATORY MUSCLE TRAINING HAS BEEN WIDELY STUDIED AND RECOMMENDED AS A TREATMENT OPTION FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN WHOLE-BODY EXERCISE TRAINING (WBET); HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS OF INSPIRATORY MUSCLE TRAINING AND YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES ON RM FUNCTION REMAIN UNKNOWN, SPECIFICALLY IN IMPAIRED OLDER ADULTS. PURPOSE: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF INSPIRATORY THRESHOLD TRAINING (ITT) AND YOGA RESPIRATORY TRAINING (YRT) ON RM FUNCTION IN INSTITUTIONALIZED FRAIL OLDER ADULTS. METHODS: EIGHTY-ONE RESIDENTS (90% WOMEN; MEAN AGE, 85 YEARS), WHO WERE UNABLE TO PERFORM WBET (INABILITY TO INDEPENDENTLY WALK MORE THAN 10 M), WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A CONTROL GROUP OR ONE OF THE 2 EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS (ITT OR YRT). EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS PERFORMED A SUPERVISED INTERVAL-BASED TRAINING PROTOCOL, EITHER THROUGH THRESHOLD INSPIRATORY MUSCLE TRAINING DEVICE OR YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES, WHICH LASTED 6 WEEKS (5 DAYS PER WEEK). OUTCOME MEASURES WERE COLLECTED AT 4 TIME POINTS (PRETRAINING, INTERMEDIATE, POSTTRAINING, AND FOLLOW-UP) AND INCLUDED THE MAXIMUM RESPIRATORY PRESSURES (MAXIMUM INSPIRATORY PRESSURE [MIP] AND MAXIMUM EXPIRATORY PRESSURE [MEP]) AND THE MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION (MVV). RESULTS: SEVENTY-ONE RESIDENTS COMPLETED THE STUDY: CONTROL (N = 24); ITT (N = 23); YRT (N = 24). THE TREATMENT ON HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON MIP YRT (F(6,204) = 6.755, P < .001, ETA2 = 0.166), MEP (F(6,204) = 4.257, P < .001, ETA2 = 0.111), AND MVV (F(6,204) = 5.322, P < .001, ETA2 = 0.135). ANALYSES SHOWED THAT THE YRT GROUP HAD A GREATER INCREASE OF RM STRENGTH (MIP AND MEP) AND ENDURANCE (MVV) THAN CONTROL AND/OR ITT GROUPS. CONCLUSION: YOGA RESPIRATORY TRAINING APPEARS TO BE AN EFFECTIVE AND WELL-TOLERATED EXERCISE REGIMEN IN FRAIL OLDER ADULTS AND MAY THEREFORE BE A USEFUL ALTERNATIVE TO ITT OR NO TRAINING, TO IMPROVE RM FUNCTION IN OLDER POPULATION, WHEN WBET IS NOT POSSIBLE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
7 2028  37 TAI CHI AND YOGA IN RESIDENTIAL AGED CARE: PERSPECTIVES OF PARTICIPANTS: A QUALITATIVE STUDY. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY EXAMINED THE APPROPRIATENESS AND ACCEPTABILITY OF 14-WEEK MODIFIED TAI CHI AND YOGA PROGRAMMES IN AN AUSTRALIAN RESIDENTIAL AGED CARE (RAC) SETTING BY EXPLORING EXPERIENCES AND PERSPECTIVES OF FRAIL OLDER RESIDENTS AND STAFF PARTICIPANTS. BACKGROUND: OLDER PERSONS IN RAC HAVE LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. TAI CHI AND YOGA ARE MINDFULNESS-BASED EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN USED TO PROMOTE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH OF OLDER ADULTS IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS. WHILE RESEARCH ON TAI CHI AND YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS IS PROMISING, THERE IS LIMITED RESEARCH REGARDING THE INTERVENTIONS' APPROPRIATENESS AND ACCEPTABILITY FOR FRAIL OLDER RESIDENTS IN RESIDENTIAL CARE SETTINGS IN AUSTRALIA. DESIGN: DESCRIPTIVE AND QUALITATIVE COMPONENT OF A MIXED-METHODS STUDY. METHODS: ALL RESIDENTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE MODIFIED YOGA AND TAI CHI INTERVENTIONS AND STAFF WHO SUPPORTED THEM WERE INVITED. A TOTAL OF 19 INDIVIDUALS COMPRISING 16 RESIDENTS AND THREE STAFF MEMBERS PARTICIPATED IN THREE FOCUS GROUP INTERVIEWS. THE INTERVIEWS WERE AUDIO-RECORDED, TRANSCRIBED AND ANALYSED THEMATICALLY USING A QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTIVE APPROACH. RESULTS: NINE THEMES THAT REFLECTED THE UNIQUENESS OF THE PROGRAMMES' MIND-BODY APPROACH ARE PRESENTED: (A) NOVEL, NEW AND EXCITING; (B) SMOOTHNESS, RHYTHM AND FLOW; (C) SLOW AND MINDFUL; (D) GENTLE BUT REWARDING; (E) MOVING WHOLE BODY; (F) PERCEIVED BENEFITS; (G) WORTHWHILE; (H) FEELING ALIVE; AND (I) CALMING AND RELAXING. CONCLUSIONS: THE MODIFIED PROGRAMMES OF TAI CHI AND YOGA WAS ACCEPTABLE, APPROPRIATE, ENJOYABLE AND HELPFUL. BOTH TAI CHI AND YOGA APPEAR TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE PHYSICAL EXERCISE AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR OLDER PERSONS TO ENHANCE THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE THROUGH INTERACTION OF PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL AND INTELLECTUAL WELLNESS DOMAINS. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: THE 14-WEEK MODIFIED PROGRAMMES OF TAI CHI AND YOGA COULD BE APPLIED TO FRAIL OLDER RAC POPULATION TO PROMOTE HEALTH AND ACTIVE AGEING.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
8 2347  59 USING SILVER YOGA EXERCISES TO PROMOTE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OF ELDERS WITH DEMENTIA IN LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES. BACKGROUND: THIS STUDY AIMED TO TEST THE EFFECTS OF YOGA EXERCISES ON THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OF ELDERLY PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA LIVING IN LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES. METHODS: A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL, PRETEST-POST-TEST DESIGN WAS USED. A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF 68 RESIDENTS IN LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES IN SOUTHERN TAIWAN, AGED 60 YEARS AND ABOVE WITH MILD TO MODERATE DEMENTIA, WAS SELECTED. AN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP OF 33 ELDERS PARTICIPATED IN A 12-WEEK YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM OF THREE 55-MINUTE SESSIONS A WEEK; A CONTROL GROUP OF 35 ELDERS MAINTAINED THEIR USUAL DAILY ACTIVITIES. DATA WERE COLLECTED BEFORE AND AFTER COMPLETING THE 12-WEEK STUDY. MEASUREMENTS INCLUDED BODY COMPOSITION, CARDIOPULMONARY FUNCTIONS, BODY FLEXIBILITY, MUSCLE STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE, BALANCE, JOINTS MOTION, DEPRESSION, AND PROBLEM BEHAVIORS. RESULTS: THE YOGA-TRAINED PARTICIPANTS HAD BETTER PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH THAN THOSE WHO DID NOT PARTICIPATE, INCLUDING LOWERED BLOOD PRESSURE, REDUCED RESPIRATION RATE, STRENGTHENED CARDIOPULMONARY FITNESS, ENHANCED BODY FLEXIBILITY, IMPROVED MUSCLE STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE, IMPROVED BALANCE, AND INCREASED JOINTS MOTION (ALL P VALUES < 0.05). IN ADDITION, THE DEPRESSION STATE (P < 0.001) AND PROBLEM BEHAVIORS (P < 0.001) OF THESE DEMENTED ELDERS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED. CONCLUSION: YOGA EXERCISE HAS POSITIVE BENEFITS FOR BOTH THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OF ELDERS WITH DEMENTIA LIVING IN LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOGA BE INCLUDED AS ONE OF THE ROUTINE ACTIVITIES IN THESE LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
9 2243  40 THE INFLUENCE OF TAI CHI AND YOGA ON BALANCE AND FALLS IN A RESIDENTIAL CARE SETTING: A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL. ABSTRACT FALLS AMONGST OLDER PEOPLE IS A GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN. WHILST FALLING IS NOT A TYPICAL FEATURE OF AGEING, OLDER PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO FALL. FALL INJURIES AMONGST OLDER PEOPLE ARE A LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH AND DISABILITY. MANY OLDER PEOPLE DO NOT DO REGULAR EXERCISE SO THAT THEY LOSE MUSCLE TONE, STRENGTH, AND FLEXIBILITY WHICH AFFECT BALANCE AND PREDISPOSE THEM TO FALLS. THE MANAGEMENT OF FALLS IN RESIDENTIAL CARE SETTINGS IS A MAJOR CONCERN WITH STRATEGIES FOR PREVENTION AND MONITORING A FOCUS IN THIS SETTING. YOGA AND TAI CHI HAVE SHOWN POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE BALANCE AND PREVENT FALLS IN OLDER ADULTS. THEY ALSO HAVE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE PAIN AND QUALITY OF LIFE. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF CONDUCTING A 3-ARM RCT WITH FRAIL OLDER PEOPLE IN A RESIDENTIAL CARE SETTING TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT A 14 WEEK MODIFIED TAI CHI OR YOGA PROGRAM IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN USUAL CARE ACTIVITY IN IMPROVING BALANCE FUNCTION, QUALITY OF LIFE, PAIN EXPERIENCE AND IN REDUCING NUMBER OF FALLS. THERE WERE NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE THREE GROUPS IN THE OCCURRENCE OF FALLS. YOGA DEMONSTRATED A SLIGHT DECREASE IN FALL INCIDENCE; QUALITY OF LIFE IMPROVED FOR THE TAI CHI GROUP. ONLY THE YOGA GROUP EXPERIENCED A REDUCTION IN AVERAGE PAIN SCORES THOUGH NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. THE FINDINGS OF THE STUDY SUGGEST IT IS POSSIBLE TO SAFELY IMPLEMENT MODIFIED YOGA AND TAI CHI IN A RESIDENTIAL CARE SETTING AND EVALUATE THIS USING RCT DESIGN. THEY SHOW POSITIVE CHANGES TO BALANCE, PAIN AND QUALITY OF LIFE AND A HIGH LEVEL OF INTEREST THROUGH ATTENDANCE AMONGST THE OLDER PARTICIPANTS. THE RESULTS SUPPORT OFFERING TAI CHI AND YOGA TO OLDER PEOPLE WHO ARE FRAIL AND DEPENDENT WITH PHYSICAL AND COGNITIVE LIMITATIONS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
10 1958  36 SELF-MANAGEMENT AND YOGA FOR OLDER ADULTS WITH CHRONIC STROKE: A MIXED-METHODS STUDY OF PHYSICAL FITNESS AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED CHANGES IN PHYSICAL FITNESS AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AMONG OLDER PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC STROKE (STROKE >/= 6 MONTHS PREVIOUS) AFTER PARTICIPATION IN A YOGA INFUSED SELF-MANAGEMENT INTERVENTION. METHODS: A MIXED-METHODS SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS EXAMINED QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF ENDURANCE, STRENGTH, AND GAIT SPEED AND QUALITATIVE PERSPECTIVES OF INTERVENTION PARTICIPANTS. RESULTS: BASED ON WILCOXON ANALYSIS, PHYSICAL FITNESS OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDING ENDURANCE AND LOWER AND UPPER BODY STRENGTH SIGNIFICANTLY (P < .02) IMPROVED. BASED ON QUALITATIVE RESULTS OF 2 FOCUS GROUPS AND 14 INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS, PARTICIPANTS EXPRESSED POSITIVE CHANGES IN ENDURANCE, STRENGTH, GAIT SPEED, FLEXIBILITY, AND BALANCE. THEY ALSO REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN WALKING ABILITY AND DURATION, AND EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO CONTINUE YOGA AND INCREASE LEVELS OF EXERCISE. CONCLUSIONS: WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF IMPROVING PHYSICAL FITNESS AND EXERCISE FOR OLDER ADULTS WITH CHRONIC STROKE, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR SELF-MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS TO PROVIDE SPECIFIC SAFE AND FEASIBLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY COMPONENTS, SUCH AS YOGA. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: HEALTH PROFESSIONALS MAY IMPROVE OFFERED CHRONIC STROKE SELF-MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS BY INCORPORATING YOGA.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
11 1982  52 SLEEP QUALITY, DEPRESSION STATE, AND HEALTH STATUS OF OLDER ADULTS AFTER SILVER YOGA EXERCISES: CLUSTER RANDOMIZED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: SLEEP DISTURBANCES, DEPRESSION, AND LOW PERCEPTION OF HEALTH STATUS ARE COMMONLY SEEN IN ELDERLY POPULATION; HOWEVER, CLINICIANS TEND TO UNDERESTIMATE OR OVERLOOK THE PRESENCE OF THESE SYMPTOMS AND ASSUME THEM TO BE A PART OF NORMAL AGING. NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL METHODS THAT PROMOTE A MIND-BODY INTERACTION SHOULD BE TESTED TO ENHANCE THE MENTAL HEALTH OF OLDER ADULTS. OBJECTIVE: TO TEST THE EFFECTS OF 6 MONTHS OF SILVER YOGA EXERCISES IN PROMOTING THE MENTAL HEALTH OF OLDER ADULTS IN SENIOR ACTIVITY CENTERS, ESPECIALLY THEIR SLEEP QUALITY, DEPRESSION, AND SELF-PERCEPTION OF HEALTH STATUS. DESIGN: CLUSTER RANDOMIZED TRIAL. SETTINGS: EIGHT SENIOR ACTIVITY CENTERS, SOUTHERN TAIWAN. PARTICIPANTS: A SAMPLE OF 139 PARTICIPANTS WAS RECRUITED, AND 128 OF THEM COMPLETED THE STUDY. INCLUSION CRITERIA: (1) COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS AGES 60 AND OVER, (2) NO PREVIOUS TRAINING IN YOGA, (3) ABLE TO WALK WITHOUT ASSISTANCE, (4) COGNITIVELY ALERT BASED ON THE SHORT PORTABLE MENTAL STATUS QUESTIONNAIRE (SPMSQ) SCORE OF EIGHT OR HIGHER, AND (5) INDEPENDENT OR MILDLY DEPENDENT IN SELF-CARE BASED ON A BARTHEL INDEX (BI) SCORE OF 91 OR HIGHER. THE MEAN AGE OF THE PARTICIPANTS WAS 69.20 +/- 6.23 YEARS, AND THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF CHRONIC ILLNESS WAS 0.83 +/- 0.90. THE AVERAGE BI SCORE OF THE PARTICIPANTS WAS 99.92 +/- 0.62, AND THE MEAN SPMSQ SCORE WAS 9.90 +/- 0.30. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED INTO EITHER THE EXPERIMENTAL (N=62) OR THE CONTROL (N=66) GROUP BASED ON ATTENDANCE AT SELECTED SENIOR ACTIVITY CENTERS. A 70-MIN SILVER YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM WAS IMPLEMENTED THREE TIMES PER WEEK FOR 6 MONTHS AS THE INTERVENTION FOR THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP. RESULTS: MOST OF THE MENTAL HEALTH INDICATORS OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED AFTER THE SILVER YOGA INTERVENTIONS, AND MANY OF THE INDICATORS IMPROVED AFTER 3 MONTHS OF INTERVENTION AND WERE MAINTAINED THROUGHOUT THE 6 MONTHS STUDY. THE MENTAL HEALTH INDICATORS OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WERE ALL BETTER THAN THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP (ALL P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: AFTER 6 MONTHS OF SILVER YOGA EXERCISES, THE SLEEP QUALITY, DEPRESSION, AND HEALTH STATUS OF OLDER ADULTS WERE ALL IMPROVED.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
12 1192  39 EXAMINING A THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS. BACKGROUND: IN THE EARLIER STAGES OF PROSTATE CANCER, EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS HAVE CREATED A NEED FOR RESEARCH TO FOCUS ON PRACTICES THAT MAY IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE THROUGHOUT SURVIVORSHIP. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS A SIGNIFICANT SUPPORTIVE CARE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS, THOUGH THE OPTIMAL MODALITY IS NOT YET UNDERSTOOD. HYPOTHESES: THE AUTHORS HYPOTHESIZED THAT YOGA WOULD BE A FEASIBLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OPTION FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS AND THEIR SUPPORT PERSONS AND THAT THE INCORPORATION OF SOCIAL SUPPORT WOULD INCREASE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ADHERENCE. METHODS: THIS 14-WEEK FEASIBILITY STUDY INVOLVED A 7-WEEK CLASS-BASED YOGA PROGRAM (ADHERENCE PHASE), FOLLOWED BY 7 WEEKS OF SELF-SELECTED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (MAINTENANCE PHASE). DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEHAVIOR, QUALITY OF LIFE, FATIGUE, STRESS, MOOD, AND FITNESS VARIABLES WERE ASSESSED AT 3 TIME POINTS. PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS' PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT WAS RATED DURING YOGA AND AFTER YOGA. RESULTS: CLASS ATTENDANCE WAS 6.1 AND 5.8 FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS (N = 15) AND THEIR SUPPORT PERSONS (N = 10), RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE 7 CLASSES. LEVELS OF PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT WERE HIGHER FOR THOSE WHO BROUGHT A SUPPORT PERSON. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WITH REGARD TO STRESS, FATIGUE, AND MOOD BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA CLASS (ALL PS < .05) WERE REPORTED BY ALL PARTICIPANTS. NO CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE NOTED ON PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVOR'S QUALITY OF LIFE OR FATIGUE OVER THE COURSE OF THE 14-WEEK STUDY. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA IS A FEASIBLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OPTION FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS. THE PROGRAM HAD A PROMISING UPTAKE RATE, HIGH PROGRAM ADHERENCE RATE, AND THERE WERE ACUTE PROGRAM BENEFITS WITH REGARD TO STRESS, FATIGUE, AND MOOD FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS. FUTURE EXAMINATION IS WARRANTED WITH REGARD TO CHRONIC BENEFITS AND GROUP COHESION INFLUENCES ON LEVELS OF PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT.	2013

THIS PILOT STUDY EXAMINED WHETHER CHAIR YOGA AND CHAIR-BASED EXERCISE ARE EFFECTIVE IN MANAGING BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES FOR OLDER ADULTS WITH LOWER EXTREMITY OSTEOARTHRITIS. BOTH INTERVENTIONS IMPROVED PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND MOBILITY OVER TIME, ALTHOUGH NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 2 INTERVENTIONS WERE IDENTIFIED.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
14  592  39 DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF A YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAMME FOR OLDER ADULTS. AIM: THIS STUDY REPORTS THE DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF A NEW YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAMME FOR OLDER ADULTS, CALLED THE SILVER YOGA PROGRAMME. BACKGROUND: YOGA PRACTICE IS ASSOCIATED WITH NUMEROUS HEALTH IMPROVEMENTS, INCLUDING REDUCED CARDIOVASCULAR RISK, BODY MASS INDEX AND BLOOD PRESSURE. YOGA IS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED RESPIRATION, PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH AND PAIN MANAGEMENT. STUDIES HAVE SUGGESTED THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA IN THE OLDER POPULATION. METHOD: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN 2005 AND IT HAD TWO PHASES. PHASE I CONSISTED OF SENDING A SURVEY TO 10 EXPERTS TO HELP DEVELOP THE SILVER YOGA PROGRAMME. A HARD COPY AND A VIDEO CONTAINING DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS AND DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE PROGRAMME WERE THEN SENT TO THE EXPERTS FOR REVIEW AND CRITIQUE REGARDING THE CLARITY AND FEASIBILITY OF THE YOGA POSTURES. PHASE II WAS AN ENQUIRY INTO OLDER ADULTS' VIEWS ON THE PROGRAMME USING A QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION AND SEMI-STRUCTURED QUALITATIVE INQUIRY. FOURTEEN WOMEN PARTICIPANTS FROM A SENIOR ACTIVITY CENTRE WERE INTERVIEWED INDIVIDUALLY AFTER 1 MONTH OF SILVER YOGA GROUP PRACTICE, THREE TIMES PER WEEK, 70 MINUTES PER SESSION. THEY WERE ASKED TO EVALUATE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF POSTURES BASED ON THE CRITERIA OF DIFFICULTY, ACCEPTABILITY, FEASIBILITY AND HELPFULNESS. FIVE OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS ASKED PARTICIPANTS TO REFLECT ON THEIR YOGA EXPERIENCES. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS' MEAN RATINGS OF THE ACCEPTABILITY, FEASIBILITY AND HELPFULNESS OF THE FOUR ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAMME (WARM-UP, HATHA YOGA, RELAXATION AND GUIDED-IMAGERY MEDITATION) RANGED FROM 8.8 +/- 1.9 TO 9.3 +/- 1.5; MEAN RATINGS OF THE DIFFICULTY OF THE PROGRAMME REVEALED THAT RELAXATION AND GUIDED-IMAGERY MEDITATION WERE FAIRLY EASY TO FOLLOW (0.1 +/- 0.3 AND 0.1 +/- 0.3 RESPECTIVELY), BUT THE POSTURES IN THE HATHA YOGA WERE RELATIVELY CHALLENGING (2.1 +/- 2.6). CONCLUSION: THE SILVER YOGA PROGRAMME SHOULD UNDERGO FURTHER PILOT-TESTING WITH LARGER SAMPLES OF OLDER ADULTS BEFORE IT IS TAKEN UP INTERNATIONALLY AS A HEALTH-PROMOTION ACTIVITY FOR OLDER ADULTS.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
15 2077  29 THE EFFECT OF CHAIR YOGA IN OLDER ADULTS WITH MODERATE AND SEVERE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. USING A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL SINGLE-GROUP DESIGN, THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE FEASIBILITY OF OLDER ADULTS WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD)-TYPE DEMENTIA TO COMPLETE THE SIT 'N' FIT CHAIR YOGA PROGRAM. PHYSICAL FUNCTION OF PARTICIPANTS WHO COMPLETED THE PROGRAM WAS MEASURED. THE NINE OLDER ADULTS WITH AD (MEAN AGE = 83) PARTICIPATED IN THE 8-WEEK SIT 'N' FIT CHAIR YOGA PROGRAM. TO MEASURE PHYSICAL FUNCTION, THE SIX-MINUTE WALK TEST, THE GAIT SPEED TEST, AND THE BERG BALANCE SCALE WERE ADMINISTERED AT PRE-INTERVENTION, 4 WEEKS, 8 WEEKS, AND 1 MONTH AFTER PROGRAM COMPLETION. ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE PROGRAM. POSITIVE CHANGES WERE SEEN ACROSS ALL PHYSICAL MEASURES. FURTHER STUDY, USING A LARGER SAMPLE AND INCLUDING A CONTROL GROUP, IS NEEDED TO FULLY DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF THE SIT 'N' FIT CHAIR YOGA PROGRAM ON OLDER ADULTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE AD.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
16  258  39 ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF A 12-WEEK YOGA VS. EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS): STUDY PROTOCOL FOR A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS) IS A COMMON AND BURDENSOME SLEEP DISORDER ASSOCIATED WITH PROFOUND IMPAIRMENT OF HEALTH, WELL-BEING, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. UNFORTUNATELY, THE MEDICATIONS USED FOR RLS MANAGEMENT CARRY RISK OF SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS, INCLUDING AUGMENTATION OF SYMPTOMS. YOGA, AN ANCIENT MIND-BODY DISCIPLINE DESIGNED TO PROMOTE PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, AND MENTAL WELL-BEING, MAY OFFER A VIABLE, LOW-RISK NEW TREATMENT. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF THIS PILOT, PARALLEL-ARM, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) ARE TO ASSESS THE ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF A 12-WEEK YOGA VS. EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RLS. METHODS: FORTY-FOUR ADULTS WITH CONFIRMED MODERATE TO SEVERE RLS WILL BE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED TO A 12-WEEK YOGA (N = 22) OR STANDARDIZED EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM (N = 22). YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS WILL ATTEND TWO 75-MIN IYENGAR YOGA CLASSES PER WEEK FOR THE FIRST 4 WEEKS, THEN ONE 75-MIN CLASS PER WEEK FOR THE REMAINING 8 WEEKS, AND WILL COMPLETE A 30-MIN HOMEWORK ROUTINE ON NON-CLASS DAYS. EDUCATIONAL FILM GROUP PARTICIPANTS WILL ATTEND ONE 75-MIN CLASS PER WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS AND COMPLETE A DAILY RLS TREATMENT LOG; CLASSES WILL INCLUDE INFORMATION ON: RLS MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING SLEEP HYGIENE PRACTICES; OTHER SLEEP DISORDERS; AND COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES LIKELY TO BE OF INTEREST TO THOSE PARTICIPATING IN A YOGA AND SLEEP EDUCATION STUDY. YOGA AND TREATMENT LOGS WILL BE COLLECTED WEEKLY. FEASIBILITY OUTCOMES WILL INCLUDE RECRUITMENT, ENROLLMENT, AND RANDOMIZATION RATES, RETENTION, ADHERENCE, AND PROGRAM SATISFACTION. PROGRAM EVALUATION AND YOGA-DOSING QUESTIONNAIRES WILL BE COLLECTED AT WEEK 12; DATA ON EXPLORATORY OUTCOMES (E.G., RLS SYMPTOM SEVERITY (IRLS), SLEEP QUALITY (PSQI), MOOD (POMS, PSS), AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (SF-36)) WILL BE GATHERED AT BASELINE AND WEEK 12. DISCUSSION: THIS STUDY WILL LAY THE ESSENTIAL GROUNDWORK FOR A PLANNED LARGER RCT TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF A YOGA PROGRAM FOR REDUCING SYMPTOMS AND ASSOCIATED BURDEN OF RLS. IF THE FINDINGS OF THE CURRENT TRIAL AND THE SUBSEQUENT LARGER RCTS ARE POSITIVE, THIS STUDY WILL ALSO HELP SUPPORT A NEW APPROACH TO CLINICAL TREATMENT OF THIS CHALLENGING DISORDER, HELP FOSTER IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF RLS ETIOLOGY, AND ULTIMATELY CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCING THE INDIVIDUAL, SOCIETAL, AND ECONOMIC BURDEN ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CONDITION.

17  107  41 A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF THE EFFECTS OF CHAIR YOGA ON PAIN AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION AMONG COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS WITH LOWER EXTREMITY OSTEOARTHRITIS. OBJECTIVES: TO DETERMINE EFFECTS OF SIT 'N' FIT CHAIR YOGA, COMPARED TO A HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAM (HEP), ON PAIN AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION IN OLDER ADULTS WITH LOWER EXTREMITY OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) WHO COULD NOT PARTICIPATE IN STANDING EXERCISE. DESIGN: TWO-ARM RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: ONE HUD SENIOR HOUSING FACILITY AND ONE DAY SENIOR CENTER IN SOUTH FLORIDA. PARTICIPANTS: COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS (N = 131) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO CHAIR YOGA (N = 66) OR HEP (N = 65). THIRTEEN DROPPED AFTER ASSIGNMENT BUT PRIOR TO THE INTERVENTION; SIX DROPPED DURING THE INTERVENTION; 106 OF 112 COMPLETED AT LEAST 12 OF 16 SESSIONS (95% RETENTION RATE). INTERVENTIONS: PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED EITHER CHAIR YOGA OR HEP. BOTH INTERVENTIONS CONSISTED OF TWICE-WEEKLY 45-MINUTE SESSIONS FOR 8 WEEKS. MEASUREMENTS: PRIMARY: PAIN, PAIN INTERFERENCE; SECONDARY: BALANCE, GAIT SPEED, FATIGUE, FUNCTIONAL ABILITY MEASURED AT BASELINE, AFTER 4 WEEKS OF INTERVENTION, AT THE END OF THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION, AND POST-INTERVENTION (1 AND 3 MONTHS). RESULTS: THE CHAIR YOGA GROUP SHOWED GREATER REDUCTION IN PAIN INTERFERENCE DURING THE INTERVENTION (P = .01), SUSTAINED THROUGH 3 MONTHS (P = .022). WOMAC PAIN (P = .048), GAIT SPEED (P = .024), AND FATIGUE (P = .037) WERE IMPROVED IN THE YOGA GROUP DURING THE INTERVENTION (P = .048) BUT IMPROVEMENTS WERE NOT SUSTAINED POST INTERVENTION. CHAIR YOGA HAD NO EFFECT ON BALANCE. CONCLUSION: AN 8-WEEK CHAIR YOGA PROGRAM WAS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCTION IN PAIN, PAIN INTERFERENCE, AND FATIGUE, AND IMPROVEMENT IN GAIT SPEED, BUT ONLY THE EFFECTS ON PAIN INTERFERENCE WERE SUSTAINED 3 MONTHS POST INTERVENTION. CHAIR YOGA SHOULD BE FURTHER EXPLORED AS A NONPHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTION FOR OLDER PEOPLE WITH OA IN THE LOWER EXTREMITIES.

18  702  47 EFFECT OF HOME-BASED TAI CHI, YOGA OR CONVENTIONAL BALANCE EXERCISE ON FUNCTIONAL BALANCE AND MOBILITY AMONG PERSONS WITH IDIOPATHIC PARKINSON'S DISEASE: AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY. BACKGROUND: INDIVIDUALS WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD) INVARIABLY EXPERIENCE FUNCTIONAL DECLINE IN A NUMBER OF MOTOR AND NON-MOTOR DOMAINS AFFECTING POSTURE, BALANCE AND GAIT. NUMEROUS CLINICAL STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED EFFECTS OF VARIOUS TYPES OF EXERCISE ON MOTOR AND NON-MOTOR PROBLEMS. BUT STILL MUCH GAP REMAINS IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF VARIOUS THERAPIES AND THEIR EFFECT ON DELAYING OR SLOWING THE DOPAMINE NEURON DEGENERATION. RECENTLY, TAI CHI AND YOGA BOTH HAVE GAINED POPULARITY AS COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES, SINCE BOTH HAVE COMPONENTS FOR MIND AND BODY CONTROL. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER EIGHT WEEKS OF HOME-BASED TAI CHI OR YOGA WAS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN REGULAR BALANCE EXERCISES ON FUNCTIONAL BALANCE AND MOBILITY. METHODS: TWENTY-SEVEN INDIVIDUALS WITH IDIOPATHIC PD (MODIFIED HOEHN AND YAHR STAGES 2.5-3) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER TAI CHI, YOGA OR CONVENTIONAL EXERCISE GROUP. ALL THE PARTICIPANTS WERE EVALUATED FOR FUNCTIONAL BALANCE AND MOBILITY USING BERG BALANCE SCALE, TIMED 10 M WALK TEST AND TIMED UP AND GO TEST BEFORE AND AFTER EIGHT WEEKS OF TRAINING. RESULTS: THE RESULTS WERE ANALYZED USING TWO-WAY MIXED ANOVA WHICH SHOWED THAT THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT MAIN EFFECT FOR TIME AS F (1, 24) = 74.18, P = 0 . 000 , ETA P 2 = 0 . 76 FOR OVERALL BALANCE IN BERG BALANCE SCALE. THERE WAS ALSO SIGNIFICANT MAIN EFFECT OF TIME ON MOBILITY OVERALL AS F(1, 24) = 77 . 78 , P = 0 . 000 , ETA P 2 = 0 . 76 IN TIMED UP AND GO TEST AND F(1, 24) = 48 . 24 , P = 0 . 000 , ETA P 2 = 0 . 67 FOR 10 M WALK TEST. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION EFFECT FOR TIME X GROUP WITH F(2, 24) = 8 . 67 , P = 0 . 001 , ETA P 2 = 0 . 420 FOR BALANCE. WITH RESPECT TO MOBILITY, THE VALUES F(2, 24) = 5 . 92 , P = 0 . 008 , ETA P 2 = 0 . 330 IN TIMED UP AND GO TEST AND F(2, 24) = 10 . 40 , P = 0 . 001 , ETA P 2 = 0 . 464 IN 10 M WALK TEST SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION. BUT THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT MAIN EFFECT BETWEEN THE GROUPS FOR BOTH BALANCE AND MOBILITY. CONCLUSION: THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT TAI CHI AS WELL AS YOGA ARE WELL ADHERED AND ARE ATTRACTIVE OPTIONS FOR A HOME-BASED SETTING. AS ANY FORM OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS CONSIDERED BENEFICIAL FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH PD EITHER TAI CHI, YOGA OR CONVENTIONAL BALANCE EXERCISES COULD BE USED AS THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION TO OPTIMIZE BALANCE AND MOBILITY. FURTHER STUDIES ARE NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THE MIND-BODY BENEFITS OF TAI CHI AND YOGA EITHER AS MULTICOMPONENT PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES OR AS INDIVIDUAL THERAPIES IN VARIOUS STAGES OF PD.	2020	

19  687  50 EFFECT OF AN OFFICE WORKSITE-BASED YOGA PROGRAM ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY: OUTCOMES OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC WORK-RELATED STRESS IS AN INDEPENDENT RISK FACTOR FOR CARDIOMETABOLIC DISEASES AND ASSOCIATED MORTALITY, PARTICULARLY WHEN COMPOUNDED BY A SEDENTARY WORK ENVIRONMENT. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE IF AN OFFICE WORKSITE-BASED HATHA YOGA PROGRAM COULD IMPROVE PHYSIOLOGICAL STRESS, EVALUATED VIA HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV), AND ASSOCIATED HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOMES IN A COHORT OF OFFICE WORKERS. METHODS: THIRTY-SEVEN ADULTS EMPLOYED IN UNIVERSITY-BASED OFFICE POSITIONS WERE RANDOMIZED UPON THE COMPLETION OF BASELINE TESTING TO AN EXPERIMENTAL OR CONTROL GROUP. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP COMPLETED A 10-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM PRESCRIBED THREE SESSIONS PER WEEK DURING LUNCH HOUR (50 MIN PER SESSION). AN EXPERIENCED INSTRUCTOR LED THE SESSIONS, WHICH EMPHASIZED ASANAS (POSTURES) AND VINYASA (EXERCISES). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS THE HIGH FREQUENCY (HF) POWER COMPONENT OF HRV. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED ADDITIONAL HRV PARAMETERS, MUSCULOSKELETAL FITNESS (I.E. PUSH-UP, SIDE-BRIDGE, AND SIT & REACH TESTS) AND PSYCHOLOGICAL INDICES (I.E. STATE AND TRAIT ANXIETY, QUALITY OF LIFE AND JOB SATISFACTION). RESULTS: ALL MEASURES OF HRV FAILED TO CHANGE IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP VERSUS THE CONTROL GROUP, EXCEPT THAT THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED LF:HF (P = 0.04) AND REDUCED PNN50 (P = 0.04) VERSUS CONTROL, CONTRARY TO OUR HYPOTHESES. FLEXIBILITY, EVALUATED VIA SIT & REACH TEST INCREASED IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP VERSUS THE CONTROL GROUP (P < 0.001). NO OTHER ADAPTATIONS WERE NOTED. POST HOC ANALYSIS COMPARING PARTICIPANTS WHO COMPLETED >/=70% OF YOGA SESSIONS (N = 11) TO CONTROL (N = 19) YIELDED THE SAME FINDINGS, EXCEPT THAT THE HIGH ADHERERS ALSO REDUCED STATE ANXIETY (P = 0.02) AND RMSSD (P = 0.05), AND TENDED TO IMPROVE THE PUSH-UP TEST (P = 0.07) VERSUS CONTROL. CONCLUSIONS: A 10-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION DELIVERED AT THE OFFICE WORKSITE DURING LUNCH HOUR DID NOT IMPROVE HF POWER OR OTHER HRV PARAMETERS. HOWEVER, IMPROVEMENTS IN FLEXIBILITY, STATE ANXIETY AND MUSCULOSKELETAL FITNESS WERE NOTED WITH HIGH ADHERENCE. FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS SHOULD INCORPORATE STRATEGIES TO PROMOTE ADHERENCE, INVOLVE MORE FREQUENT AND LONGER DURATIONS OF YOGA TRAINING, AND ENROL COHORTS WHO SUFFER FROM HIGHER LEVELS OF WORK-RELATED STRESS.

20  666  32 EFFECT OF A 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION ON FEAR OF FALLING AND BALANCE IN OLDER ADULTS: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE WHETHER FEAR OF FALLING (FOF) AND BALANCE IMPROVED AFTER A 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION AMONG OLDER ADULTS. DESIGN: A 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION SINGLE-ARMED PILOT STUDY. SETTING: A RETIREMENT COMMUNITY IN A MEDIUM-SIZED UNIVERSITY TOWN IN THE MIDWEST. PARTICIPANTS: A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF ADULTS (N=14) OVER THE AGE OF 65 YEARS WHO ALL ENDORSED AN FOF. INTERVENTION: EACH PARTICIPANT TOOK PART IN A BIWEEKLY 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. THE YOGA SESSIONS INCLUDED BOTH PHYSICAL POSTURES AND BREATHING EXERCISES. POSTURES WERE COMPLETED IN SITTING AND STANDING POSITIONS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: WE MEASURED FOF WITH THE ILLINOIS FOF MEASURE AND BALANCE WITH THE BERG BALANCE SCALE. UPPER- AND LOWER-BODY FLEXIBILITY WERE MEASURED WITH THE BACK SCRATCH TEST AND CHAIR SIT AND REACH TEST, RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS: FOF DECREASED BY 6%, STATIC BALANCE INCREASED BY 4% (P=.045), AND LOWER-BODY FLEXIBILITY INCREASED BY 34%. CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT YOGA MAY BE A PROMISING INTERVENTION TO MANAGE FOF AND IMPROVE BALANCE, THEREBY REDUCING FALL RISK FOR OLDER ADULTS. REHABILITATION THERAPISTS MAY WISH TO EXPLORE YOGA AS A MODALITY FOR BALANCE AND FALLS PROGRAMMING; HOWEVER, FUTURE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO CONFIRM THE USE OF YOGA IN SUCH PROGRAMMING.	2010

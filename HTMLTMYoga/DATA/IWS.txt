1 1492 159 INTERNALIZED WEIGHT STIGMA AND INTUITIVE EATING AMONG STRESSED ADULTS DURING A MINDFUL YOGA INTERVENTION: ASSOCIATIONS WITH CHANGES IN MINDFULNESS AND SELF-COMPASSION. PURPOSE: INTERNALIZED WEIGHT STIGMA (IWS) IS COMMON IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ACROSS BODY WEIGHT CATEGORIES, AND IS IMPLICATED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DISTRESS AND UNHEALTHY EATING BEHAVIORS (E.G. OVEREATING, DISORDERED EATING) THAT CAN FOSTER POOR CARDIOMETABOLIC HEALTH. WHILE EMERGING INTERVENTION RESEARCH SHOWS EARLY PROMISE IN REDUCING IWS, LONG-TERM EFFICACY IS UNCLEAR AND NOVEL STRATEGIES REMAIN NEEDED. THIS ANALYSIS EXAMINED WHETHER PARTICIPATION IN A MINDFUL YOGA INTERVENTION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED IWS AND INCREASED INTUITIVE EATING, AN ADAPTIVE EATING BEHAVIOR, AND WHETHER THESE CHANGES CORRELATED WITH EACH OTHER OR WITH CHANGES IN MINDFULNESS AND SELF-COMPASSION. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE STRESSED ADULTS WITH LOW FRUIT AND VEGETABLE INTAKE (N = 78, 64.1% WHITE, M. BODY MASS INDEX 25.59 +/- 4.45) ENROLLED IN A PARENT CLINICAL TRIAL OF A 12-WEEK MINDFUL YOGA INTERVENTION. VALIDATED SELF-REPORT MEASURES OF IWS, INTUITIVE EATING, MINDFULNESS, AND SELF-COMPASSION WERE ADMINISTERED AT PRE-TREATMENT, MID-TREATMENT (8 WEEKS), POST-TREATMENT (12 WEEKS), AND 4-MONTH FOLLOW-UP (24 WEEKS). RESULTS: LINEAR MIXED MODELING REVEALED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN IWS AND INTUITIVE EATING ACROSS THE FOUR TIMEPOINTS (P < .001). REDUCED IWS CORRELATED WITH INCREASED INTUITIVE EATING PRE- TO POST-TREATMENT (P = .01). IMPROVED SELF-COMPASSION AND MINDFULNESS CORRELATED WITH INTUITIVE EATING (BOTH P = . 04), BUT NOT IWS (P = .74 AND P = .56, RESPECTIVELY). CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY OFFERS PRELIMINARY SUPPORT FOR THE HYPOTHESIS THAT MINDFUL YOGA MAY PROMOTE INTUITIVE EATING AND REDUCE IWS AMONG STRESSED ADULTS WITH POOR DIET, AND SUGGESTS THAT CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS MAY CO-OCCUR OVER TIME. FURTHER INVESTIGATION WITH CONTROLLED DESIGNS IS NECESSARY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE TEMPORALITY AND CAUSALITY OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS.TRIAL REGISTRATION: CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT02098018.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
2 1697  30 PAIN UNCERTAINTY IN PATIENTS WITH FIBROMYALGIA, YOGA PRACTITIONERS, AND HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS. BACKGROUND: UNCERTAINTY ABOUT POTENTIALLY PAINFUL EVENTS AFFECTS HOW PAIN IS EXPERIENCED. INDIVIDUALS WITH FIBROMYALGIA (FM) OFTEN EXHIBIT ANXIETY AND CATASTROPHIC THOUGHTS REGARDING PAIN AND DIFFICULTIES DEALING WITH PAIN UNCERTAINTY. OBJECTIVES: THE EFFECTS OF PAIN UNCERTAINTY IN PREDICTABLY HIGH ODDS (HO), PREDICTABLY LOW ODDS (LO), AND EVEN ODDS (EO) CONDITIONS ON SUBJECTIVE RATINGS OF PAIN (PR) AND SKIN CONDUCTANCE RESPONSES (SCR) FOLLOWING THE ADMINISTRATION OF A PAINFUL STIMULUS WERE EXAMINED FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH FIBROMYALGIA (IWFM), HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS (HVS), AND YOGA PRACTITIONERS (YPS). WE HYPOTHESIZED IWFM WOULD DEMONSTRATE THE GREATEST PHYSIOLOGICAL REACTIVITY TO PAIN UNCERTAINTY, FOLLOWED BY HVS AND YPS, RESPECTIVELY. METHODS: NINE IWFM, 7 YPS, AND 10 HVS PARTICIPATED. RESULTS: CUSTOM CONTRAST ESTIMATES COMPARING RESPONSES FOR HO, LO, AND EO PAIN CONDITIONS SHOWED HIGHER SCR FOR IWFM (CE = 1.27, P = 0.01) BUT NOT FOR HVS OR FOR YPS. PR FOR THE EO CONDITION WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN FOR HO AND LO CONDITIONS FOR IWFM (CE = 0.60, P = 0.012) BUT NOT FOR HVS OR YPS. YPS HAD LOWER SCR AND PR THAN DID HVS. CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS SHOW THAT UNCERTAINTY REGARDING PAIN INCREASES THE EXPERIENCE OF PAIN, WHEREAS CERTAINTY REGARDING PAIN MAY REDUCE PAIN RATINGS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH FIBROMYALGIA.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
3 2734  60 YOGA PARTICIPATION ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN DIETARY PATTERNS AND STRESS: A PILOT STUDY IN STRESSED ADULTS WITH POOR DIET. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: STRESS CONTRIBUTES TO DIETARY PATTERNS THAT IMPEDE HEALTH. YOGA IS AN INTEGRATIVE STRESS MANAGEMENT APPROACH ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED DIETARY PATTERNS IN BURGEONING RESEARCH. YET, NO RESEARCH HAS EXAMINED CHANGE IN DIETARY PATTERNS, BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), AND STRESS DURING A YOGA INTERVENTION AMONG STRESSED ADULTS WITH POOR DIET. MATERIALS AND METHODS: OBJECTIVELY-MEASURED BMI AND A BATTERY OF SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES WERE COLLECTED AT FOUR TIME POINTS DURING AND FOLLOWING A 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION (N = 78, 71% WOMEN, MEAN BMI = 25.69 KG/M(2)+/-4.59) - PRE-TREATMENT (T1), MID-TREATMENT (6 WEEKS; T2), POST-TREATMENT (12 WEEKS; T3), AND AT 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP (24 WEEKS; T4). RESULTS: T1 TO T3 FRUIT AND VEGETABLE INTAKE, BMI, AND STRESS SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINED IN THE OVERALL SAMPLE. REDUCTION IN VEGETABLE INTAKE WAS NO LONGER SIGNIFICANT AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR REDUCTIONS IN CALORIC INTAKE, AND REDUCTION IN CALORIC INTAKE REMAINED SIGNIFICANT AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR REDUCTIONS IN STRESS. CONCLUSION: FINDINGS MAY BE INTERPRETED AS YOGA EITHER ENCOURAGING OR ADVERSELY IMPACTING HEALTHY DIETARY PATTERNS (I.E., MINIMIZING LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE WEIGHT GAIN VS. DECREASING VEGETABLE INTAKE AND OVERALL CALORIC INTAKE AMONG INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY NOT NEED TO LOSE WEIGHT, RESPECTIVELY). CONTINUED RESEARCH IS WARRANTED, UTILIZING CAUSAL DESIGNS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
4 2329  26 TRUNK AND HIP MUSCLE ACTIVATION DURING YOGA POSES: IMPLICATIONS FOR PHYSICAL THERAPY PRACTICE. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE AND COMPARE ACTIVATION OF CORE MUSCLES DURING YOGA TO TRADITIONAL BACK EXERCISES. METHODS: SURFACE ELECTROMYOGRAPHY WAS USED TO QUANTIFY ACTIVATION OF THE RECTUS ABDOMINIS (RA), ABDOMINAL OBLIQUES (AO), LUMBAR EXTENSORS (LE), AND GLUTEUS MAXIMUS (GMX) DURING FOUR YOGA POSES. DATA WERE EXPRESSED AS 100% OF A MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY ISOMETRIC CONTRACTION. SEPARATE ANALYSES OF VARIANCE WITH REPEATED MEASURES WERE USED TO COMPARE MUSCLE ACTIVITY ACROSS EACH EXERCISE. RESULTS: SUBJECTS GENERATED GREATER RA (P < 0.0001) AND AO (P < 0.0001) ACTIVITY DURING THE PLANK. THEY GENERATED GREATER AO ACTIVITY (P < 0.0001) DURING THE UPWARD-FACING DOG THAN THE CHAIR AND DOMINANT-SIDE WARRIOR 1. LE ACTIVITY WAS GREATEST (P < 0.0001) DURING THE CHAIR. GMX ACTIVITY WAS SIMILAR (P = 0.09) DURING ALL EXERCISES. CONCLUSION: YOGA POSES MAY HELP IMPROVE CORE ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH. CLINICIANS MAY USE THESE DATA WHEN DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING AN EVIDENCE-BASED CORE EXERCISE PROGRAM FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO PREFER A YOGA TREATMENT STRATEGY.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
5 2746  36 YOGA PRACTICE IN A COLLEGE SAMPLE: ASSOCIATED CHANGES IN EATING DISORDER, BODY IMAGE, AND RELATED FACTORS OVER TIME. YOGA PRACTICE IS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN EATING DISORDER (ED) SYMPTOMS AND BODY DISSATISFACTION. THIS STUDY CONTINUED TO EVALUATE THIS RELATIONSHIP WHILE ALSO ASSESSING CHANGES IN VARIABLES NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH ED SYMPTOMS (SELF-COMPASSION, MINDFULNESS, BODY APPRECIATION, SELF-EFFICACY) THAT ARE EMPHASIZED THROUGHOUT YOGA. MEN WERE ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS STUDY GIVEN STUDIES HAVE PREDOMINANTLY FOCUSED ON WOMEN. PARTICIPANTS (N = 99, 77.8% WOMEN) WERE RECRUITED FROM A UNIVERSITY-IMPLEMENTED YOGA COURSE AND COMPLETED ASSESSMENTS AT THE BEGINNING (TIME 1 (T1)) AND END (TIME 2 (T2)) OF AN EIGHT-WEEK YOGA COURSE MEETING THREE TIMES A WEEK FOR FIFTY MINUTES. BODY DISSATISFACTION (PS <.05) AND ED PATHOLOGY (P = .02) WERE LOWER AT T2. BODY APPRECIATION (P < .001), SELF-COMPASSION (P = .01), YOGA SELF-EFFICACY (P = .004) WERE HIGHER AT T2. SOME GENDER DIFFERENCES EMERGED. MEN REPORTED GREATER REDUCTIONS IN CONCERN WITH BEING OVERWEIGHT, (OVERWEIGHT PREOCCUPATION) FROM T1 (M = 2.46, SD = 0.61) TO T2 (M = 2.13, SD = 0.61) COMPARED TO WOMEN, T1 (M = 2.75, SD = 0.98) TO T2 (M = 2.69, SD = 0.97) ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA PRACTICE. MEN ALSO REPORTED GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN BODY SATISFACTION (APPEARANCE EVALUATION) FROM T1 (M = 3.60, SD = 0.49) TO T2 (M = 3.90, SD = 0.34) COMPARED WITH WOMEN, T1 (M = 3.48, SD = 0.58) TO T2 (M = 3.39, SD = 0.52) ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA PRACTICE. RESULTS SUGGEST YOGA MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH CONCURRENT CHANGES IN PROTECTIVE AND RISK FACTORS FOR ED IN A COLLEGE POPULATION.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
6 2739  43 YOGA PRACTICE AMONG ETHNICALLY/RACIALLY DIVERSE EMERGING ADULTS: ASSOCIATIONS WITH BODY IMAGE, MINDFUL AND DISORDERED EATING, AND MUSCLE-ENHANCING BEHAVIORS. BACKGROUND: THIS STUDY EXPLORES CROSS-SECTIONAL ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN YOGA AND BODY IMAGE, MINDFUL EATING, DISORDERED EATING, AND MUSCLE-ENHANCING BEHAVIORS AMONG A POPULATION-BASED SAMPLE OF ETHNICALLY/RACIALLY DIVERSE EMERGING ADULTS. METHOD: AN ETHNICALLY/RACIALLY DIVERSE POPULATION-BASED SAMPLE OF 1,568 EMERGING ADULTS (18-26 YEARS) COMPLETED SURVEYS AS PART OF EAT 2010-2018 (EATING AND ACTIVITY OVER TIME). MODELS WERE ADJUSTED FOR SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS AND BODY MASS INDEX (BMI). RESULTS: PRACTICING YOGA AT LEAST 30 MIN/WEEK WAS REPORTED BY 12.7% (N = 210) OF THE SAMPLE. YOGA PRACTITIONERS HAD HIGHER LEVELS OF MINDFUL EATING THAN THOSE NOT PRACTICING YOGA. ALTHOUGH EFFECT SIZES WERE SMALL, YOGA PRACTITIONERS WERE MORE LIKELY THAN NON-YOGA PRACTITIONERS TO USE STEROIDS (3.8 VS. 0.7%, P < .001, H = 0.22) OR PROTEIN POWDER/SHAKES (35.1 VS. 25.3%, P < .010, H = 0.21) TO INCREASE THEIR MUSCLE SIZE/TONE. BODY SATISFACTION, UNHEALTHY WEIGHT CONTROL BEHAVIORS, AND BINGE EATING TENDED TO BE SIMILAR AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND NON-YOGA PRACTITIONERS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION BETWEEN BMI AND YOGA IN PREDICTING BODY SATISFACTION WITH A TREND TOWARD A POSITIVE IMPACT AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS AT HIGHER BMI VALUES. INTERACTIONS BETWEEN YOGA PRACTICE AND ALL BODY IMAGE ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS ACROSS GENDER AND ETHNICITY/RACE WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. DISCUSSION: YOUNG PEOPLE FROM DIVERSE ETHNIC/RACIAL BACKGROUNDS WHO PRACTICE YOGA ARE MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN MINDFUL EATING BUT HAVE EQUAL OR ELEVATED LEVELS OF UNHEALTHY BODY IMAGE ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS AS COMPARED TO NON-YOGA PRACTITIONERS. FURTHER RESEARCH SHOULD EXPLORE HOW YOGA IS BEST TAUGHT AND PRACTICED TO ENSURE THAT IT IS BENEFICIAL FOR BODY IMAGE AND RELATED BEHAVIORS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
7 2434  26 YOGA AND PILATES: ASSOCIATIONS WITH BODY IMAGE AND DISORDERED-EATING BEHAVIORS IN A POPULATION-BASED SAMPLE OF YOUNG ADULTS. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN PARTICIPATING IN MIND-BODY ACTIVITIES (YOGA/PILATES) AND BODY DISSATISFACTION AND DISORDERED EATING (UNHEALTHY AND EXTREME WEIGHT CONTROL PRACTICES AND BINGE EATING) IN A POPULATION-BASED SAMPLE OF YOUNG ADULTS. METHOD: THE SAMPLE INCLUDED 1,030 YOUNG MEN AND 1,257 YOUNG WOMEN (MEAN AGE: 25.3 YEARS, SD = 1.7) WHO PARTICIPATED IN PROJECT EAT-III (EATING AND ACTIVITY IN TEENS AND YOUNG ADULTS). RESULTS: AMONG WOMEN, DISORDERED EATING WAS PREVALENT IN YOGA/PILATES PARTICIPANTS AND NONPARTICIPANTS, WITH NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GROUPS. MEN PARTICIPATING IN YOGA/PILATES WERE MORE LIKELY TO USE EXTREME WEIGHT CONTROL BEHAVIORS (18.6% VS. 6.8%, P = .006) AND BINGE EATING (11.6% VS. 4.2%, P = .023), AND MARGINALLY MORE LIKELY TO USE UNHEALTHY WEIGHT CONTROL BEHAVIORS (49.1% VS. 34.5%; P = .053), THAN NONPARTICIPANTS AFTER ADJUSTING FOR SOCIODEMOGRAPHICS, WEIGHT STATUS, AND OVERALL PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. DISCUSSION: FINDINGS SUGGEST THE IMPORTANCE OF HELPING YOGA/PILATES INSTRUCTORS RECOGNIZE THAT THEIR STUDENTS MAY BE AT RISK FOR DISORDERED EATING.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
8 1832  47 PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING, HEALTH BEHAVIORS, AND WEIGHT LOSS AMONG PARTICIPANTS IN A RESIDENTIAL, KRIPALU YOGA-BASED WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM. UNLABELLED: THE INCREASING PREVALENCE OF OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY IN HUMANS IS A GROWING PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERN IN THE UNITED STATES. CONCOMITANTS INCLUDE POOR HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND REDUCED PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING. PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE SUGGESTS YOGA AND TREATMENT PARADIGMS INCORPORATING MINDFULNESS, SELF-COMPASSION (SC), ACCEPTANCE, NON-DIETING, AND INTUITIVE EATING MAY IMPROVE THESE ANCILLARY CORRELATES, WHICH MAY PROMOTE LONG-TERM WEIGHT LOSS. METHODS: WE EXPLORED THE IMPACT OF A 5-DAY RESIDENTIAL WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM, WHICH WAS MULTIFACETED AND BASED ON KRIPALU YOGA, ON HEALTH BEHAVIORS, WEIGHT LOSS, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING IN OVERWEIGHT/OBESE INDIVIDUALS. THIRTY-SEVEN OVERWEIGHT/OBESE PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS (AGE 32-65, BMI<25) COMPLETED VALIDATED MIND-FULNESS, SC, LIFESTYLE BEHAVIOR, AND MOOD QUESTIONNAIRES AT BASELINE, POST-PROGRAM, AND 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP AND REPORTED THEIR WEIGHT 1 YEAR AFTER PROGRAM COMPLETION. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN NUTRITION BEHAVIORS, SC, MINDFULNESS, STRESS MANAGEMENT, AND SPIRITUAL GROWTH WERE OBSERVED IMMEDIATELY POST-PROGRAM (N = 31, 84% RETENTION), WITH MEDIUM TO LARGE EFFECT SIZES. AT 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP (N = 18, 49% RETENTION), MOST CHANGES PERSISTED. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND MOOD DISTURBANCE HAD IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY POST-PROGRAM BUT FAILED TO REACH SIGNIFICANCE AT 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. SELF-REPORT WEIGHT LOSS AT 1 YEAR (N = 19, 51% RETENTION) WAS SIGNIFICANT. CONCLUSION: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST A KRIPALU YOGA-BASED, RESIDENTIAL WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM MAY FOSTER PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING, IMPROVED NUTRITION BEHAVIORS, AND WEIGHT LOSS. GIVEN THE EXPLORATORY NATURE OF THIS INVESTIGATION, MORE RIGOROUS WORK IN THIS AREA IS WARRANTED.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
9 1375  41 IMPACT OF DAILY YOGA-BASED EXERCISE ON PAIN, CATASTROPHIZING, AND SLEEP AMONGST INDIVIDUALS WITH FIBROMYALGIA. BACKGROUND: FIBROMYALGIA (FM) IS A CHRONIC WIDESPREAD PAIN DISORDER CHARACTERIZED BY NEGATIVE AFFECT, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, AND FATIGUE. THIS UNCONTROLLED PILOT STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFICACY OF DAILY YOGA-BASED EXERCISE TO IMPROVE FM SYMPTOMS AND EXPLORED BASELINE PHENOTYPIC CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH THE GREATEST BENEFIT. METHODS: FM PATIENTS (N=46, WITH 36 COMPLETERS) REPORTED PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING AND A RANGE OF FM SYMPTOMS USING VALIDATED INSTRUMENTS BEFORE AND AFTER PARTICIPATION IN SATYANANDA YOGA, WHICH INCLUDED WEEKLY IN-PERSON PAIN-TAILORED GROUP CLASSES FOR 6 WEEKS AND DAILY HOME YOGA VIDEO PRACTICE. RESULTS: CHANGES IN FM SYMPTOMS FROM PRE- TO POST-YOGA WERE VARIABLE AMONGST PARTICIPANTS. GROUP MEANS FOR PAIN DECREASED, AS REPORTED BY AVERAGE DAILY DIARY AND BRIEF PAIN INVENTORY, WITH GREATER HOME PRACTICE MINUTES ASSOCIATED WITH A GREATER DECREASE IN PAIN. AVERAGE DAILY RATINGS OF SLEEP AND FATIGUE IMPROVED. PAIN CATASTROPHIZING WAS DECREASED OVERALL, WITH GREATER CHANGE CORRELATED TO A DECREASE IN FM SYMPTOMS. WE DID NOT OBSERVE ANY GROUP MEAN CHANGES IN ACTIGRAPHY SLEEP EFFICIENCY, PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES MEASUREMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM-ANXIETY AND THE REVISED FIBROMYALGIA IMPACT QUESTIONNAIRE. MULTILEVEL MODELING ANALYSIS REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION BETWEEN ANXIETY AND CATASTROPHIZING FOR END-STUDY SLEEP EFFICIENCY, FATIGUE, AND PAIN, SUCH THAT PATIENTS WITH HIGHER BASELINE CATASTROPHIZING AND LOWER BASELINE ANXIETY REPORTED LESS PAIN AND FATIGUE, AND HIGHER SLEEP EFFICIENCY AFTER THE SIXTH WEEK OF YOGA PRACTICE. CONCLUSION: THIS PILOT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT YOGA MAY REDUCE PAIN AND CATASTROPHIZING, AS WELL AS IMPROVE SLEEP, BUT THESE CHANGES WERE MODEST ACROSS STUDY PARTICIPANTS. GREATER UPTAKE OF HOME YOGA PRACTICE AS WELL AS A PHENOTYPE OF HIGHER BASELINE CATASTROPHIZING COMBINED WITH LOWER BASELINE ANXIETY WERE ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER IMPACT. FUTURE RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIALS COMPARING DIFFERENT TYPES OF YOGA OR EXERCISE WILL ALLOW DETERMINATION OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS FOR FM AND ALLOW CLOSER TARGETING TO THE PATIENTS WHO WILL BENEFIT MOST FROM THEM.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                        
10  999  33 EFFECTS OF INTUITIVE EATING ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND WELLBEING OF YOGA PRACTITIONERS, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PRACTITIONERS AND SEDENTARY INDIVIDUALS. THIS STUDY IS A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF INTUITIVE EATING AND CORRELATIONS WITH QUALITY OF LIFE AND WELLBEING IN YOGA PRACTITIONERS, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PRACTITIONERS AND SEDENTARY INDIVIDUALS. THE STUDY INVOLVED 204 PARTICIPANTS, COMPRISING 66 YOGA PRACTITIONERS, 74 PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PRACTITIONERS AND 64 SEDENTARY INDIVIDUALS, BETWEEN THE AGES OF 20 AND 59, WHO WERE RESIDENT IN BRAZIL AT THE TIME OF THE STUDY. QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED THROUGH FACEBOOK AND THE APPLICATION QUESTIONNAIRES VIA GOOGLE FORMS TO MEASURE INTUITIVE EATING, FOOD CONSUMPTION, QUALITY OF LIFE, STRESS LEVEL, SATISFACTION WITH BODY IMAGE AND LEVEL OF MINDFULNESS. THE STUDY FOUND THAT WHILE INTUITIVE EATING DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PRACTITIONERS, BOTH SHOWED GREATER ADOPTION OF INTUITIVE EATING AS COMPARED TO INACTIVE INDIVIDUALS. STILL, YOGA PRACTITIONERS HAD BETTER CONFIDENCE IN THEIR PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNS OF HUNGER AND SATIETY, AS WELL AS BETTER EATING BEHAVIOR, QUALITY OF LIFE, SATISFACTION WITH BODY IMAGE, HEALTHY BODY WEIGHT, AND STRESS-RELATED EMOTIONAL REGULATION, AS COMPARED TO THE OTHER GROUPS. IN ADDITION, THERE WAS A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN INTUITIVE EATING AND QUALITY OF LIFE, BODY ESTEEM, MINDFULNESS AND EATING BEHAVIORS THAT DISCOURAGED EATING IN RESPONSE TO EXTERNAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL INFLUENCES, AND A NEGATIVE CORRELATION TO STRESS AND WEIGHT GAIN. THIS STUDY FINDS THAT PHYSICAL EXERCISE, IN PARTICULAR THE PRACTICE OF YOGA, IS LINKED TO THE PROMOTION OF BETTER INTUITIVE EATING BEHAVIOR AS WELL AS BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE AND WELLBEING.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
11 2506  23 YOGA ATTITUDES IN CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: ROLES OF CATASTROPHIZING AND FEAR OF MOVEMENT. CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN IS A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM AND, ALTHOUGH UNDERUSED, YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT. THE CURRENT STUDY EXAMINED ASSOCIATIONS OF PAIN CATASTROPHIZING AND FEAR OF MOVEMENT WITH ATTITUDES TOWARD YOGA IN ADULTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THREE QUANTITATIVE QUESTIONNAIRES ASSESSING SPECIFIC CONSTRUCTS: BELIEFS ABOUT YOGA, FEAR OF MOVEMENT, AND PAIN CATASTROPHIZING. A SEMI-STRUCTURED IN-PERSON INTERVIEW WAS THEN CONDUCTED TO OBTAIN SPECIFIC PAIN-RELATED INFORMATION. HIERARCHICAL REGRESSION AND MEDIATIONAL ANALYSES WERE USED TO TEST HYPOTHESES. CONSISTENT WITH THE FEAR-AVOIDANCE MODEL OF CHRONIC PAIN, CATASTROPHIZING AND FEAR OF MOVEMENT WERE NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA ATTITUDES. SPECIFICALLY, FEAR OF MOVEMENT WAS A MEDIATOR BETWEEN CATASTROPHIZING AND ATTITUDES TOWARD YOGA. INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF CATASTROPHIZING AND FEAR OF MOVEMENT MAY BE LESS LIKELY TO CONSIDER A PAIN TREATMENT INVOLVING PHYSICAL MOVEMENT.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
12 2328  19 TRUNK AND HIP MUSCLE ACTIVATION DURING YOGA POSES: DO SEX-DIFFERENCES EXIST? OBJECTIVE: TO COMPARE CORE ACTIVATION DURING YOGA BETWEEN MALES AND FEMALES. METHODS: SURFACE ELECTROMYOGRAPHY WAS USED TO QUANTIFY RECTUS ABDOMINIS (RA), ABDOMINAL OBLIQUES (AO), LUMBAR EXTENSORS (LE), AND GLUTEUS MAXIMUS (GMX) ACTIVATION DURING FOUR YOGA POSES. DATA WERE EXPRESSED AS 100% OF A MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY ISOMETRIC CONTRACTION. MIXED-MODEL 2X2 ANALYSES OF VARIANCE WITH REPEATED MEASURES WERE USED TO DETERMINE BETWEEN-SEX DIFFERENCES IN MUSCLE ACTIVITY. RESULTS: FEMALES GENERATED GREATER RA ACTIVITY THAN MALES DURING THE HIGH PLANK (P<0.0001) AND DOMINANT-SIDE WARRIOR 1 (P=0.017). THEY GENERATED GREATER AO (P<0.0001) AND GMX (P=0.004) ACTIVITY DURING THE HIGH PLANK (P<0.0001). NO BETWEEN-SEX EMG ACTIVITY DIFFERENCES EXISTED FOR THE CHAIR AND UPWARD FACING DOG. CONCLUSION: FINDINGS HAVE PROVIDED PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE FOR BETWEEN-SEX DIFFERENCES IN MUSCLE ACTIVATION DURING YOGA POSES. CLINICIANS SHOULD CONSIDER SUCH DIFFERENCES WHEN PRESCRIBING YOGA TO IMPROVE MUSCLE STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
13  302  42 AN EIGHT-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION IS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN PAIN, PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONING AND MINDFULNESS, AND CHANGES IN CORTISOL LEVELS IN WOMEN WITH FIBROMYALGIA. OBJECTIVES: FIBROMYALGIA (FM) IS A CHRONIC CONDITION CHARACTERIZED BY WIDESPREAD MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN, FATIGUE, DEPRESSION, AND HYPOCORTISOLISM. TO DATE, PUBLISHED STUDIES HAVE NOT INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CORTISOL IN FM. THIS PILOT STUDY USED A TIME SERIES DESIGN TO EVALUATE PAIN, PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIABLES, MINDFULNESS, AND CORTISOL IN WOMEN WITH FM BEFORE AND AFTER A YOGA INTERVENTION. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS (N = 22) WERE RECRUITED FROM THE COMMUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN A 75 MINUTE YOGA CLASS TWICE WEEKLY FOR 8 WEEKS. QUESTIONNAIRES CONCERNING PAIN (INTENSITY, UNPLEASANTNESS, QUALITY, SUM OF LOCAL AREAS OF PAIN, CATASTROPHIZING, ACCEPTANCE, DISABILITY), ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND MINDFULNESS WERE ADMINISTERED PRE-, MID- AND POST-INTERVENTION. SALIVARY CORTISOL SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED THREE TIMES A DAY FOR EACH OF TWO DAYS, PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION. RESULTS: REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA) REVEALED THAT MEAN +/- STANDARD DEVIATION (SD) SCORES IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY (P < 0.05) FROM PRE- TO POST-INTERVENTION FOR CONTINUOUS PAIN (PRE: 5.18 +/- 1.72; POST: 4.44 +/- 2.03), PAIN CATASTROPHIZING (PRE: 25.33 +/- 14.77; POST: 20.40 +/- 17.01), PAIN ACCEPTANCE (PRE: 60.47 +/- 23.43; POST: 65.50 +/- 22.93), AND MINDFULNESS (PRE: 120.21 +/- 21.80; POST: 130.63 +/- 20.82). INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT MEDIAN AUC FOR POST-INTERVENTION CORTISOL (263.69) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER (P < 0.05) THAN MEDIAN AUC FOR PRE-INTERVENTION LEVELS (189.46). MEDIATION ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT MID-INTERVENTION MINDFULNESS SCORES SIGNIFICANTLY (P < 0.05) MEDIATED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION PAIN CATASTROPHIZING SCORES. DISCUSSION: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT A YOGA INTERVENTION MAY REDUCE PAIN AND CATASTROPHIZING, INCREASE ACCEPTANCE AND MINDFULNESS, AND ALTER TOTAL CORTISOL LEVELS IN WOMEN WITH FM. THE CHANGES IN MINDFULNESS AND CORTISOL LEVELS MAY PROVIDE PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE FOR MECHANISMS OF A YOGA PROGRAM FOR WOMEN WITH FM. FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD USE AN RCT DESIGN WITH A LARGER SAMPLE SIZE.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
14 1320  44 HEATED HATHA YOGA TO TARGET CORTISOL REACTIVITY TO STRESS AND AFFECTIVE EATING IN WOMEN AT RISK FOR OBESITY-RELATED ILLNESSES: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: CORTISOL REACTIVITY TO STRESS IS ASSOCIATED WITH AFFECTIVE EATING, AN IMPORTANT BEHAVIORAL RISK FACTOR FOR OBESITY AND RELATED METABOLIC DISEASES. YOGA PRACTICE IS RELATED TO DECREASES IN STRESS AND CORTISOL LEVELS, THUS EMERGING AS A POTENTIAL TARGETED COMPLEMENTARY INTERVENTION FOR AFFECTIVE EATING. THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL EXAMINED THE EFFICACY OF A HEATED, HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION FOR REDUCING CORTISOL REACTIVITY TO STRESS AND AFFECTIVE EATING. METHOD: FEMALES (N = 52; AGES 25-46 YEARS; 75% WHITE) AT RISK FOR OBESITY AND RELATED ILLNESSES WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO 8 WEEKS OF BIKRAM YOGA PRACTICE OR TO WAITLIST CONTROL. CORTISOL REACTIVITY TO A LABORATORY STRESS INDUCTION WERE MEASURED AT WEEKS 0 (PRETREATMENT) AND 9 (POSTTREATMENT). SELF-REPORTED BINGE EATING FREQUENCY AND COPING MOTIVES FOR EATING WERE ASSESSED AT WEEKS 0, 3, 6, AND 9. RESULTS: AMONG PARTICIPANTS WITH ELEVATED CORTISOL REACTIVITY AT PRETREATMENT ("HIGH REACTORS"), THOSE RANDOMIZED TO THE YOGA CONDITION EVIDENCED GREATER PRE- TO POSTTREATMENT REDUCTIONS IN CORTISOL REACTIVITY (P = .042, D = .85), BUT THERE WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT CONDITION DIFFERENCES FOR THE "LOW REACTORS" (P = .178, D = .53). YOGA PARTICIPANTS REPORTED GREATER DECREASES IN BINGE EATING FREQUENCY (P = .040, D = .62) AND EATING TO COPE WITH NEGATIVE AFFECT (P = .038, D = .54). CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY PROVIDES PRELIMINARY SUPPORT FOR THE EFFICACY OF HEATED HATHA YOGA FOR TREATING PHYSIOLOGICAL STRESS REACTIVITY AND AFFECTIVE EATING AMONG WOMEN AT RISK FOR OBESITY-RELATED ILLNESSES.

15 2338  28 UNIQUE AUTONOMIC RESPONSES TO PAIN IN YOGA PRACTITIONERS. OBJECTIVE: AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM ACTIVITY IS ASSOCIATED WITH NEUROBEHAVIORAL ASPECTS OF PAIN. YOGIS USE BREATHING, RELAXATION, AND MINDFULNESS TO TOLERATE PAIN, WHICH COULD INFLUENCE AUTONOMIC RESPONSES. TO EVALUATE HOW THE LINK BETWEEN AUTONOMIC RESPONSES AND PAIN IS ALTERED BY OTHER FACTORS, WE COMPARED PERCEPTUAL AND AUTONOMIC RESPONSES TO PAIN BETWEEN YOGIS AND CONTROLS. METHODS: NINETEEN YOGIS AND 15 CONTROLS RATED WARM AND PAINFULLY HOT STIMULI (1-CM THERMODE ON CALF), WITH VISUAL ANTICIPATORY CUES INDICATING CERTAINLY PAINFUL, CERTAINLY NONPAINFUL, OR UNCERTAINLY EITHER PAINFUL OR NONPAINFUL. HEART RATE, SKIN CONDUCTANCE, RESPIRATION, AND BLOOD PRESSURE WERE MEASURED. RESULTS: AT BASELINE, YOGIS BREATHED SLOWER AND DEEPER THAN DID CONTROLS, WITH NO DIFFERENCES IN OTHER AUTONOMIC MEASURES. DURING THE TASK, PERCEPTUAL RATINGS DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN GROUPS IN EITHER THE CERTAIN OR UNCERTAIN CONDITIONS. NEVERTHELESS, YOGIS HAD HIGHER PHASIC SKIN CONDUCTANCE RESPONSES IN ANTICIPATION OF AND RESPONSE TO ALL STIMULI, BUT PARTICULARLY DURING PAINFUL HEAT IN UNCERTAIN CONTEXTS (UNCERTAIN: 0.46 [0.34] MUS; CERTAIN: 0.37 [0.28] MUS; T(18) = 3.962, P = .001). FURTHERMORE, CONTROLS SHOWED A DECREASE IN HEART RATE TO WARM (-2.51 [2.17] BEATS/MIN) VERSUS PAINFUL STIMULI (0.83 [1.63] BEATS/MIN; T(13) = 5.212, P < .001) AND LOWER RESPIRATORY SINUS ARRHYTHMIA DURING PAIN COMPARED WITH WARM TRIALS, WHEREAS YOGIS HAD SIMILAR REACTIONS TO PAINFUL AND NONPAINFUL STIMULI. CONCLUSIONS: AUTONOMIC RESPONSES TO PAIN DIFFERED IN YOGIS AND HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS, DESPITE SIMILAR PAIN RATINGS. THUS, AUTONOMIC REACTIVITY TO PAIN MAY BE ALTERED BY ENVIRONMENTAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS THROUGHOUT AN INDIVIDUAL'S LIFE.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
16 1336  37 HOW DOES YOGA REDUCE STRESS? A CLINICAL TRIAL TESTING PSYCHOLOGICAL MECHANISMS. YOGA INTERVENTIONS CAN REDUCE STRESS, BUT THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THAT STRESS REDUCTION REMAIN LARGELY UNIDENTIFIED. UNDERSTANDING HOW YOGA WORKS IS ESSENTIAL TO OPTIMIZING INTERVENTIONS. THE PRESENT STUDY TESTED FIVE POTENTIAL PSYCHOSOCIAL MECHANISMS (INCREASED MINDFULNESS, INTEROCEPTIVE AWARENESS, SPIRITUAL WELL-BEING, SELF-COMPASSION AND SELF-CONTROL) THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO EXPLAIN YOGA'S IMPACT ON STRESS. FORTY-TWO PARTICIPANTS (62% FEMALE; 64% WHITE) IN A YOGA PROGRAM FOR STRESS REDUCTION COMPLETED SURVEYS AT BASELINE (T1), MID-INTERVENTION (T2) AND POST-INTERVENTION (12 WEEKS; T3). WE MEASURED TWO ASPECTS OF STRESS, PERCEIVED STRESS AND STRESS REACTIVITY. CHANGES WERE ASSESSED WITH PAIRED T-TESTS; ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN CHANGES IN MECHANISMS WERE TESTED IN RESIDUAL CHANGE MODELS. ONLY STRESS REACTIVITY DECREASED, ON AVERAGE, FROM T1 TO T3. EXCEPT FOR SELF-COMPASSION, ALL PSYCHOSOCIAL MECHANISMS INCREASED FROM T1 TO T3, WITH MINIMAL CHANGES FROM T2 TO T3. EXCEPT FOR SELF-CONTROL, INCREASES IN EACH MECHANISM WERE STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASES IN BOTH MEASURES OF STRESS BETWEEN T1 AND T2 AND DECREASES IN PERCEIVED STRESS FROM T1 TO T3 (ALL P'S < 0.05). INCREASED PSYCHOSOCIAL RESOURCES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH STRESS REDUCTION. YOGA INTERVENTIONS TARGETING THESE RESOURCES MAY SHOW STRONGER STRESS REDUCTION EFFECTS. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD TEST THESE LINKAGES MORE RIGOROUSLY USING ACTIVE COMPARISON GROUPS AND LARGER SAMPLES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
17  636  36 DISTRESS TOLERANCE AS A PREDICTOR OF ADHERENCE TO A YOGA INTERVENTION: MODERATING ROLES OF BMI AND BODY IMAGE. THIS STUDY TESTED WHETHER DISTRESS TOLERANCE, BODY IMAGE, AND BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) PREDICTED ADHERENCE TO A YOGA INTERVENTION. PARTICIPANTS WERE 27 WOMEN WHO PARTICIPATED IN A YOGA INTERVENTION AS PART OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. ATTENDANCE AND DISTRESS TOLERANCE WERE ASSESSED WEEKLY, AND BODY IMAGE AND BMI WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE. MULTILEVEL MODELING REVEALED A THREE-WAY INTERACTION OF DISTRESS TOLERANCE, BMI, AND BODY IMAGE (P < .001). FOR PARTICIPANTS WITH FEW BODY IMAGE CONCERNS, DISTRESS TOLERANCE WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH ADHERENCE REGARDLESS OF BMI (P = .009). HOWEVER, FOR THOSE WITH POOR BODY IMAGE, INCREASES IN DISTRESS TOLERANCE WERE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASES IN ADHERENCE AMONG OVERWEIGHT PARTICIPANTS (P < .001) BUT LOWER ADHERENCE AMONG OBESE PARTICIPANTS (P = .007). DISTRESS TOLERANCE MAY BE IMPLICATED IN ADHERENCE TO A YOGA INTERVENTION, ALTHOUGH ITS EFFECTS MAY BE DEPENDENT ON BODY IMAGE CONCERNS, BMI, AND THEIR INTERACTION. RESEARCH AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
18 1271  31 FREQUENCY OF YOGA PRACTICE PREDICTS HEALTH: RESULTS OF A NATIONAL SURVEY OF YOGA PRACTITIONERS. BACKGROUND. YOGA SHOWS PROMISE AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION, BUT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN YOGA PRACTICE AND HEALTH ARE UNDEREXPLORED. PURPOSE. TO EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOGA PRACTICE AND HEALTH (SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING, DIET, BMI, SMOKING, ALCOHOL/CAFFEINE CONSUMPTION, SLEEP, FATIGUE, SOCIAL SUPPORT, MINDFULNESS, AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY). METHODS. CROSS-SECTIONAL, ANONYMOUS INTERNET SURVEYS DISTRIBUTED TO 4307 RANDOMLY SELECTED FROM 18,160 INDIVIDUALS AT 15 US IYENGAR YOGA STUDIOS; 1045 (24.3%) SURVEYS COMPLETED. RESULTS. MEAN AGE 51.7 (+/- 11.7) YEARS; 84.2% FEMALE. FREQUENCY OF HOME PRACTICE FAVORABLY PREDICTED (P < .001): MINDFULNESS, SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING, BMI, FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION, VEGETARIAN STATUS, SLEEP, AND FATIGUE. EACH COMPONENT OF YOGA PRACTICE (DIFFERENT CATEGORIES OF PHYSICAL POSES, BREATH WORK, MEDITATION, PHILOSOPHY STUDY) PREDICTED AT LEAST 1 HEALTH OUTCOME (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS. HOME PRACTICE OF YOGA PREDICTED HEALTH BETTER THAN YEARS OF PRACTICE OR CLASS FREQUENCY. DIFFERENT PHYSICAL POSES AND YOGA TECHNIQUES MAY HAVE UNIQUE HEALTH BENEFITS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
19 2370  41 WHAT BRINGS YOUNG ADULTS TO THE YOGA MAT? CROSS-SECTIONAL ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AND PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH AMONG PARTICIPANTS IN THE PROJECT EAT-IV SURVEY. OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY EXAMINES MOTIVATIONS FOR YOGA AND IDENTIFIES UNIQUE MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AMONG A SAMPLE OF YOUNG ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS. THIS STUDY FURTHER DETERMINES HOW YOUNG ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS' MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES ASSOCIATE WITH PHYSICAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS. SUBJECTS/SETTING: SURVEY DATA WERE DRAWN FROM THE FOURTH WAVE OF A LARGE, POPULATION-BASED STUDY (PROJECT EAT-IV; EATING AND ACTIVITY IN TEENS AND YOUNG ADULTS). DESIGN: LATENT CLASS ANALYSIS (LCA) WAS USED TO IDENTIFY MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AMONG PROJECT EAT-IV PARTICIPANTS PRACTICING YOGA (N = 297; MEAN AGE: 30.8-1.7 YEARS; 79.7 % FEMALE). CROSS-SECTIONAL ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN LATENT MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES, PHYSICAL HEALTH BEHAVIORS, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS WERE DETERMINED WITH UNADJUSTED AND ADJUSTED (GENDER, RACE/ETHNICITY, AND BODY MASS INDEX) GENERAL LINEAR MODELS. RESULTS: ACROSS MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES, MOST YOUNG ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS WERE MOTIVATED BY ENHANCED FITNESS AND STRESS REDUCTION/RELAXATION. ADDITIONAL MOTIVATIONS FOR YOGA CLUSTERED BY APPEARANCE (DESIRE TO CHANGE BODY APPEARANCE OR WEIGHT) OR MINDFULNESS (DESIRE TO INCREASE PRESENT MOMENT AWARENESS) UNDERPINNINGS. THE LCA CHARACTERIZED MOTIVATIONAL PROFILES AS "LOW APPEARANCE, LOW MINDFULNESS" (CLASS 1; N = 77), "LOW APPEARANCE, HIGH MINDFULNESS" (CLASS 2; N = 48), "HIGH APPEARANCE, LOW MINDFULNESS" (CLASS 3; N = 79), AND "HIGH APPEARANCE, HIGH MINDFULNESS" (CLASS 4; N = 93). HAVING A PROFILE WITH HIGH MINDFULNESS AND LOW APPEARANCE MOTIVATIONS (CLASS 2) WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER BODY SATISFACTION IN COMPARISON TO THE OTHER CLASSES (P < 0.001). RELATIVE TO CLASS 2, THOSE WITH LOW MINDFULNESS MOTIVATIONS (CLASS 1; CLASS 3) REPORTED LESS TOTAL PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (P = 0.002) AND THOSE WITH HIGH APPEARANCE MOTIVATIONS (CLASS 3; CLASS 4) REPORTED HIGHER COMPULSIVE EXERCISE SCORES (P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: IN THIS SAMPLE, HIGH MINDFULNESS AND LOW APPEARANCE MOTIVATIONS FOR YOGA APPEARED OPTIMAL FOR PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH. CROSS-SECTIONAL FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOUNG ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS' MIND-BODY HEALTH MAY BE SUPPORTED BY MOTIVATIONAL UNDERPINNINGS THAT EMPHASIZE YOGA'S INTERNAL (MINDFULNESS) RATHER THAN EXTERNAL (APPEARANCE) BENEFITS.	2022	

20 1293  44 GROUP-BASED YOGIC WEIGHT LOSS WITH AYURVEDA-INSPIRED COMPONENTS: A PILOT INVESTIGATION OF FEMALE YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND NOVICES. INTRODUCTION: OVERWEIGHT/OBESITY IS A PRESSING INTERNATIONAL HEALTH CONCERN AND CONVENTIONAL TREATMENTS DEMONSTRATE POOR LONG-TERM EFFICACY. PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE SUGGESTS YOGA AND AYURVEDA MAY BE PROMISING APPROACHES, ALTHOUGH RECENT NHIS ESTIMATES INDICATE RARE UTILIZATION OF AYURVEDA IN THE US. GROUP-BASED CURRICULA THAT INTEGRATE YOGA AND AYURVEDA-INSPIRED PRINCIPLES TO ATTENUATE OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY ACROSS INDIVIDUALS MAY PROVE A FEASIBLE, DISSEMINABLE CLINICAL ADJUNCT TO FACILITATE PSYCHOSOCIAL HEALTH AND WEIGHT LOSS AND/OR MAINTENANCE. AIMS: DETERMINE FEASIBILITY AND PRELIMINARY EFFECTIVENESS OF A TEN-WEEK YOGA - BASED, AYURVEDA-INSPIRED WEIGHT MANAGEMENT CURRICULUM (YWL) PILOTED IN FEMALE YOGA PRACTITIONERS (STUDY 1) THEN REFINED AND TAILORED FOR YOGA NAIVES (STUDY 2), ON SELF-REPORTED PSYCHOSOCIAL PROCESS VARIABLES AND % OF SELF-REPORTED TOTAL BODY WEIGHT LOSS (%TBWL). METHODOLOGY: STUDY 1 ENROLLED 22 YOGA-EXPERIENCED WOMEN (48.2 +/- 14.3 YEARS, BMI 30.8 +/- 4.2 KG/M2) IN A 10-WEEK YOGA-BASED PROGRAM (YWL-YE). STUDY 2 ENROLLED 21 YOGA- NAIVE WOMEN (49.4 +/- 10.7 YEARS, BMI 35.5 +/- 6.8 KG/M2) IN A REVISED 10-WEEK PROGRAM (YWL-YN). SELF-REPORTED WEIGHT AND SELF-RATINGS OF MINDFUL EATING BEHAVIOR, BODY IMAGE DISTURBANCE, WEIGHT LOSS SELF-EFFICACY, BODY AWARENESS, AND SELF-COMPASSION WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE, POST-TREATMENT (T2), AND 3-MONTH FOLLOW- UP (T3). RESULTS: YWL CURRICULA WAS FEASIBLE IN BOTH STUDIES. WHILE ATTRITION RATES FOR BOTH STUDIES FAVORABLY COMPARED TO OTHER WEIGHT MANAGEMENT STUDIES, ATTRITION WAS HIGHER FOR YWL-YN (28.6%) THAN YWL-YE (18.2%). IN BOTH STUDIES, SELF-REPORTED PROCESS VARIABLES AND SELF-REPORTED % TBWL CHANGED IN HYPOTHESIZED DIRECTIONS AT T2 AND EVIDENCED GREATER IMPROVEMENT AT T3; EFFECT SIZES ACROSS ALL PROCESS VARIABLES WERE MEDIUM (-0.4) TO LARGE (-1.8). % TBWL REACHED CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE (>5%) ONLY AT T3 FOR THE YWL-YE GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: THE YWL CURRICULA EMPLOYED HERE APPEAR TO IMPROVE PSYCHOSOCIAL HEALTH AMONG BOTH OVERWEIGHT/OBESE YOGA-EXPERIENCED AND YOGA- NAIVE WOMEN. RESULTS MUST BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION DUE TO STUDY DESIGN, SELF-REPORT ASSESSMENTS, AND OTHER LIMITATIONS. NONETHELESS, HYPOTHESES ARE GENERATED FOR FUTURE INVESTIGATION.	2016

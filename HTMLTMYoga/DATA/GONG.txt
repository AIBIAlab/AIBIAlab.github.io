1  539 121 COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN PARKINSON DISEASE: A REVIEW OF ACUPUNCTURE, TAI CHI, QI GONG, YOGA, AND CANNABIS. PARKINSON DISEASE (PD) IS A PROGRESSIVE NEURODEGENERATIVE CONDITION CHARACTERIZED BY BRADYKINESIA, RIGIDITY, RESTING TREMOR, AND POSTURAL INSTABILITY. NON-MOTOR SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING PAIN, FATIGUE, INSOMNIA, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION TO NAME A FEW, ARE INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED AND OFTEN JUST AS DISABLING AT MOTOR SYMPTOMS. THE MAINSTAY OF TREATMENT IS DOPAMINE REPLACEMENT; HOWEVER, THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS TEND TO WANE OVER TIME WITH DISEASE PROGRESSION, AND PATIENTS OFTEN EXPERIENCE MOTOR FLUCTUATIONS AND MEDICATION SIDE EFFECTS. THE LACK OF A DISEASE-MODIFYING INTERVENTION AND THE SHORTCOMINGS OF TRADITIONAL SYMPTOMATIC MEDICATIONS HAVE LED MANY PATIENTS TO PURSUE COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES TO ALLEVIATE MOTOR AND NON-MOTOR SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH PD. THE TERM COMPLEMENTARY IMPLIES THAT THE THERAPY IS USED ALONG WITH CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE AND MAY INCLUDE SUPPLEMENTS, MANIPULATIVE TREATMENTS (CHIROPRACTIC, MASSAGE), EXERCISE-BASED PROGRAMS, AND MIND-BODY PRACTICES. AS THESE PRACTICES BECOME MORE WIDESPREAD IN WESTERN MEDICINE, THERE IS A GROWING INTEREST IN EVALUATING THEIR EFFECTS ON A NUMBER OF MEDICAL CONDITIONS, PD INCLUDED. IN THIS REVIEW, WE PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON CLINICAL TRIALS THAT HAVE EVALUATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENTS FOR PATIENTS WITH PD, SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING ON ACUPUNCTURE, TAI CHI, QI GONG, YOGA, AND CANNABIS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
2 1973  40 SHOULD ACUPUNCTURE, BIOFEEDBACK, MASSAGE, QI GONG, RELAXATION THERAPY, DEVICE-GUIDED BREATHING, YOGA AND TAI CHI BE USED TO REDUCE BLOOD PRESSURE?: RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON HIGH-QUALITY SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS. BACKGROUND: THIS REVIEW AIMS TO RATE THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE AND THE STRENGTH OF RECOMMENDATIONS IN HIGH-QUALITY SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF NON-DRUG THERAPIES. HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS WHO ARE RESISTANT OR NON-ADHERENT TO ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS MAY BE EASIER TO MANAGE IF THEY CHOOSE ALTERNATIVE NON-DRUG THERAPIES FOR HYPERTENSION, BASED ON THIS REVIEW. METHODS: P: ADULTS (>18 YEARS), EXCEPT PREGNANT WOMEN, WITH ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION. I: CUPPING, MOXIBUSTION, ACUPUNCTURE, ACUPOINT STIMULATION, YOGA, MEDITATION, TAI CHI, QI GONG, CHINESE MASSAGE, MASSAGE, SPINAL MANIPULATION, BIOFEEDBACK, DEVICE-GUIDED BREATHING THERAPY, AROMATHERAPY, MUSIC THERAPY, AND RELAXATION APPROACHES. C: 1. NO TREATMENT. 2. SHAM THERAPY. 3. CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT, INCLUDING ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS AND LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION (E.G., EXERCISE). O: 1. CHANGE IN THE INCIDENCE OF CARDIOVASCULAR DEATH. 2. CHANGE IN THE INCIDENCE OF MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION. 3. CHANGE IN THE INCIDENCE OF STROKE. 4. CHANGE IN BLOOD PRESSURE (BP). 5. EFFICACY RATE OF BP LOWERING. 6. ADVERSE EFFECTS (REVIEW SPECIFIC). S: SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS, INCLUDING META-ANALYSES AND ASSESSMENTS OF THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY/RISK OF BIAS. INFORMATION SOURCES: COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS, DATABASE OF ABSTRACTS OF REVIEWS OF EFFECTS, COCHRANE LIBRARY, PUBMED, WEB OF SCIENCE, CHINA NATIONAL KNOWLEDGE INFRASTRUCTURE, AND CHINESE SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL DATABASE WERE SEARCHED. THE BIBLIOGRAPHIES OF THE INCLUDED ARTICLES WERE ALSO SEARCHED FOR RELEVANT SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS. GRADE CRITERIA WERE USED TO RATE THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE IN SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS CONSIDERING 6 FACTORS, INCLUDING RISK OF BIAS. RESULTS: THIS REVIEW ULTIMATELY INCLUDED 13 SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF 14 NON-DRUG THERAPIES (ACUPUNCTURE, WET CUPPING, BADUANJIN, BLOOD LETTING, AURICULAR ACUPUNCTURE, MUSIC, MASSAGE, QI GONG, MOXIBUSTION, RELAXATION THERAPIES, BIOFEEDBACK, DEVICE-GUIDED BREATHING, YOGA AND TAI CHI) BASED ON THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE WAS GENERALLY LOW, AND WEAK RECOMMENDATIONS WERE GIVEN FOR MOST THERAPIES EXCEPT MASSAGE AND ACUPUNCTURE PLUS ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUG. BASED ON THE ANALYZED EVIDENCE, MASSAGE AND ACUPUNCTURE PLUS ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUG COULD BENEFIT PEOPLE WHO WANT TO LOWER THEIR BP AND DO NOT HAVE CONTRAINDICATIONS FOR MASSAGE AND ACUPUNCTURE PLUS ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUG. DISCUSSION/STRENGTH: THE GRADE APPROACH MAKES THIS REVIEW A UNIQUE REFERENCE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSIDERING THE GRADE OF QUALITY OF EVIDENCE IN SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS, THE BALANCE OF DESIRABLE AND UNDESIRABLE CONSEQUENCES AND THE STRENGTH OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO DECIDE WHICH INTERVENTION SHOULD BE USED TO REDUCE BP. LIMITATIONS: MANY NON-DRUG THERAPIES WERE EXCLUDED DUE TO THE LOW METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF THEIR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS, AND ONLY 14 THERAPIES WERE EVALUATED IN THIS REVIEW. AS NO PATIENT-IMPORTANT OUTCOMES WERE REVIEWED, SURROGATE OUTCOMES WERE USED TO RATE THE STRENGTH OF RECOMMENDATIONS. THIS APPROACH MAY CAUSE A DECREASE IN EVIDENCE QUALITY ACCORDING TO GRADE, BUT WE ARGUE THAT THIS IS APPROPRIATE IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS REVIEW.	2019	

3  576  34 DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY DISORDERS: BENEFITS OF EXERCISE, YOGA, AND MEDITATION. MANY PEOPLE WITH DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY TURN TO NONPHARMACOLOGIC AND NONCONVENTIONAL INTERVENTIONS, INCLUDING EXERCISE, YOGA, MEDITATION, TAI CHI, OR QI GONG. META-ANALYSES AND SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS HAVE SHOWN THAT THESE INTERVENTIONS CAN IMPROVE SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY DISORDERS. AS AN ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT, EXERCISE SEEMS MOST HELPFUL FOR TREATMENT-RESISTANT DEPRESSION, UNIPOLAR DEPRESSION, AND POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. YOGA AS MONOTHERAPY OR ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY SHOWS POSITIVE EFFECTS, PARTICULARLY FOR DEPRESSION. AS AN ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY, IT FACILITATES TREATMENT OF ANXIETY DISORDERS, PARTICULARLY PANIC DISORDER. TAI CHI AND QI GONG MAY BE HELPFUL AS ADJUNCTIVE THERAPIES FOR DEPRESSION, BUT EFFECTS ARE INCONSISTENT. AS MONOTHERAPY OR AN ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY, MINDFULNESS-BASED MEDITATION HAS POSITIVE EFFECTS ON DEPRESSION, AND ITS EFFECTS CAN LAST FOR SIX MONTHS OR MORE. ALTHOUGH POSITIVE FINDINGS ARE LESS COMMON IN PEOPLE WITH ANXIETY DISORDERS, THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS ADJUNCTIVE USE. THERE ARE NO APPARENT NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS, AND THEIR GENERAL HEALTH BENEFITS JUSTIFY THEIR USE AS ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY DISORDERS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
4 1141  25 EFFICACY OF YOGA, TAI CHI AND QI GONG ON THE MAIN SYMPTOMS OF CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. INTRODUCTION: THE AIM OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS TO SUMMARIZE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA, QI GONG OR TAI CHI IN COPD PATIENTS. METHODS: STUDIES EVALUATING EFFECTS OF THE SELECTED COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES ON LUNG FUNCTION, DYSPNEA, QUALITY OF LIFE OR FUNCTIONAL EXERCISE CAPACITY IN COPD PATIENTS WERE IDENTIFIED AND REVIEWED FROM THREE DATABASES. RESULTS: EIGHTEEN STUDIES WERE INCLUDED. SIX STUDIES EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND THE OTHERS FOCUSED ON TAI CHI OR QI GONG SEPARATELY OR COMBINED. THE DURATION OF THE PROGRAMS RANGED FROM 6 WEEKS TO 6 MONTHS AND THE FREQUENCY FROM 2 TO 7 TIMES A WEEK. EACH SESSION REACHED 30 TO 90 MINUTES. BENEFITS WERE OBSERVED ON LUNG FUNCTION AND FUNCTIONAL EXERCISE CAPACITY BUT BENEFIT WAS CLEARLY STATED NEITHER ON QUALITY OF LIFE NOR ON DYSPNEA. CONCLUSION: THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW HIGHLIGHTS THE POTENTIAL OF THESE THERAPIES AS COMPLEMENTARY THERAPEUTIC APPROACH IN COPD PATIENTS.	2019

MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS (MBIS), WITH POSTURES, BREATH, RELAXATION, AND MEDITATION, SUCH AS MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION (MBSR) AND YOGA, ARE COMPLEX INTERVENTIONS INCREASINGLY USED FOR TRAUMA-RELATED PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS. PRIOR REVIEWS HAVE ADOPTED A DISORDER-SPECIFIC FOCUS. HOWEVER, TRAUMA IS A RISK FACTOR FOR MOST PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS. WE ADOPTED A TRANSDIAGNOSTIC APPROACH TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF MBIS FOR THE CONSEQUENCES OF TRAUMA, AGNOSTIC TO DIAGNOSIS. AMED, CINAHL, CENTRAL, EMBASE, PUBMED/MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, AND SCOPUS WERE SEARCHED TO 30 SEPTEMBER 2018 FOR CONTROLLED AND UNCONTROLLED TRIALS OF MINDFULNESS, YOGA, TAI CHI, AND QI GONG IN PEOPLE SPECIFICALLY SELECTED FOR TRAUMA EXPOSURE. OF >12,000 RESULTS, 66 STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IN THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND 24 CONTROLLED STUDIES WERE META-ANALYZED. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT, POOLED EFFECT OF MBIS (G = 0.51, 95%CI 0.31 TO 0.71, P < .001). SIMILAR EFFECTS WERE OBSERVED FOR MINDFULNESS (G = 0.45, 0.26 TO 0.64, P < .001), YOGA (G = 0.46, 0.26 TO 0.66, P < .001), AND INTEGRATIVE EXERCISE (G = 0.94, 0.37 TO 1.51, P = .001), WITH NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN INTERVENTIONS. OUTCOME MEASURE OR TRAUMA TYPE DID NOT INFLUENCE THE EFFECTIVENESS, BUT INTERVENTIONS OF 8 WEEKS OR MORE WERE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN SHORTER INTERVENTIONS (Q = 8.39, DF = 2, P = .02). MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS, ADJUNCTIVE TO TREATMENT-AS-USUAL OF MEDICATION AND/OR PSYCHOTHERAPY, ARE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING TRAUMA-RELATED SYMPTOMS. YOGA AND MINDFULNESS HAVE COMPARABLE EFFECTIVENESS. MANY PSYCHIATRIC STUDIES DO NOT REPORT TRAUMA EXPOSURE, FOCUSING ON DISORDER-SPECIFIC OUTCOMES, BUT THIS REVIEW SUGGESTS A TRANSDIAGNOSTIC APPROACH COULD BE ADOPTED IN THE TREATMENT OF TRAUMA SEQUELAE WITH MBIS. MORE RIGOROUS REPORTING OF TRAUMA EXPOSURE AND MBI TREATMENT PROTOCOLS IS RECOMMENDED TO ENHANCE FUTURE RESEARCH.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
6  538  24 COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT FOR NECK PAIN: CHIROPRACTIC, ACUPUNCTURE, TENS, MASSAGE, YOGA, TAI CHI, AND FELDENKRAIS. OF THE MULTITUDE OF TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF NECK PAIN, NO OBVIOUS SINGLE TREATMENT MODALITY HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE MOST EFFICACIOUS. AS SUCH, THE CLINICIAN SHOULD CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT MODALITIES IF A MODALITY IS ENGAGING, AVAILABLE, FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE, POTENTIALLY EFFICACIOUS, AND IS LOW RISK FOR THE PATIENT. AS EVIDENCE-BASED MEDICINE FOR NECK PAIN DEVELOPS, THE CLINICIAN IS FACED WITH THE CHALLENGE OF WHICH TREATMENTS TO ENCOURAGE PATIENTS TO PURSUE. TREATMENT MODALITIES EXPLORED IN THIS ARTICLE, INCLUDING CHIROPRACTIC, ACUPUNCTURE, TENS, MASSAGE, YOGA, TAI CHI, AND FELDENKRAIS, REPRESENT REASONABLE COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE METHODS FOR PATIENTS WITH NECK PAIN.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
7 1890  34 REGULATION OF GENE EXPRESSION BY YOGA, MEDITATION AND RELATED PRACTICES: A REVIEW OF RECENT STUDIES. INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE (IM) APPROACHES HAVE GAINED SIGNIFICANT INTEREST IN RECENT YEARS TO PROVIDE A SOLUTION FOR THE HEALTH CARE CHALLENGES WE FACE TODAY. YOGIC COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL PRACTICES ARE AMONG THE MOST WIDELY USED IM APPROACHES AND INCLUDE DIVERSE PRACTICES SUCH AS YOGA ASANAS, MEDITATION, BREATHING EXERCISES, QI GONG, TAI CHI CHIH, AND VARIOUS OTHERS. STUDIES TO DATE SUGGEST THAT THESE YOGIC/MEDITATIVE PRACTICES HAVE SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECTS ON THE MIND-BODY SYSTEM AND THEREBY CAN INCREASE WELLNESS AND SUPPORT THE HEALING PROCESS FROM DISEASE. PREVIOUS WORK HAS PROVIDED EVIDENCE FOR BOTH PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF THESE PRACTICES; HOWEVER, THE MECHANISMS OF THESE EFFECTS, ESPECIALLY AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL, HAVE LARGELY BEEN MISSING. THREE RECENT STUDIES STARTED TO PROVIDE SOME OF THIS INFORMATION THROUGH GENE EXPRESSION PROFILING IN CIRCULATING IMMUNE CELLS, WHICH SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT YOGIC/MEDITATIVE PRACTICES HAVE A MEASURABLE EFFECT AT THE MOLECULAR LEVEL. THESE STUDIES ARE REVIEWED HEREIN AND SOME FUTURE PERSPECTIVES ARE CONSIDERED.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
8 2026  30 TAI CHI AND YOGA AS COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN RHEUMATOLOGIC CONDITIONS. TAI CHI AND YOGA ARE COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES WHICH HAVE, DURING THE LAST FEW DECADES, EMERGED AS POPULAR TREATMENTS FOR RHEUMATOLOGIC AND MUSCULOSKELETAL DISEASES. THIS REVIEW COVERS THE EVIDENCE OF TAI CHI AND YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF RHEUMATOLOGIC DISEASES, ESPECIALLY OSTEOARTHRITIS OF THE KNEE, HIP AND HAND, AND RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT TAI CHI AND YOGA ARE SAFE, AND SOME EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAVE BENEFIT, LEADING TO REDUCTION OF PAIN AND IMPROVEMENT OF PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TAI CHI IN KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN ISSUED BY THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RHEUMATOLOGY. TO ALLOW BROADER RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE USE OF TAI CHI AND YOGA IN RHEUMATIC DISEASES, THERE IS A NEED TO COLLECT MORE EVIDENCE RESEARCHED WITH LARGER RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS.	2012

THE HEALTH PRACTITIONER MAY ENCOUNTER CLIENTS WHO ARE FACED WITH PROBLEMS THAT DO NOT SEEM TO RESPOND TO TRADITIONAL HEALTH CARE. 2. ONE WAY THAT SOME CHOOSE TO CONFRONT THESE SYSTEMIC COMPLAINTS IS TO EMPLOY SOME OF THE HEALTH TRADITIONS OF OTHER CULTURES AND TO VIEW THE BODY AND MIND AS A BALANCED WHOLE. 3. MASSAGE, ACUPUNCTURE AND ACUPRESSURE, T'AI CHI, AND FELDENKRAIS FOCUS ON THE MIND/BODY CONNECTION TO FACILITATE HEALING THROUGH RELAXATION, PRESSURE POINTS, AND MOVEMENT.	1993	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
10   92  38 A NARRATIVE REVIEW OF MOVEMENT-BASED MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS: EFFECTS OF YOGA, TAI CHI, AND QIGONG FOR BACK PAIN PATIENTS. THIS NARRATIVE LITERATURE REVIEW EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF MOVEMENT-BASED MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS (MMBIS; YOGA, TAI CHI, AND QIGONG) ON LOW BACK PAIN. A SEARCH OF DATABASES WAS CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY RELEVANT STUDIES. THIRTY-TWO ARTICLES MET INCLUSION CRITERIA AND WERE INCLUDED FOR THIS NARRATIVE REVIEW. OF THE REVIEWED STUDIES, THE HIGHEST NUMBER FOCUSED ON YOGA INTERVENTION (N = 25), 4 FOCUSED ON QIGONG, AND 3 FOCUSED ON TAI CHI IN MANAGING BACK PAIN. THE SELECTED ARTICLES SHOWED MMBI TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR TREATMENT OF LOW BACK PAIN, REPORTING POSITIVE OUTCOMES SUCH AS REDUCTION IN PAIN OR PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS (EG, DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY), AND IMPROVED FUNCTIONAL ABILITY. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF MMBI, IN PARTICULAR QIGONG AND TAI CHI. MORE CLINICAL TRIALS ARE NEEDED TO DETERMINE HOW TO REDUCE BACK PAIN, IMPROVE PHYSICAL FUNCTION, AND MINIMIZE BEHAVIORAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH LOW BACK PAIN. NURSE PRACTITIONERS MAY INTRODUCE SUCH MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS FOR MANAGING PAIN, ESPECIALLY FOR PATIENTS AT HIGH RISK FOR ADVERSE EFFECTS FROM PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT, AND REFER THEM TO A YOGA THERAPIST, TAI-CHI INSTRUCTOR, OR QIGONG INSTRUCTOR.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
11 2199  34 THE EFFICACY OF TAI CHI AND YOGA IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND SPONDYLOARTHROPATHIES: A NARRATIVE BIOMEDICAL REVIEW. RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA) AND SPONDYLOARTHROPATHIES (SPA) ARE AMONG THE MOST COMMON INFLAMMATORY RHEUMATIC DISEASES, WHICH MIGHT INDUCE CHRONIC PAIN FOR THEIR SUFFERERS. MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS LIKE TAI CHI AND YOGA ARE AMONG THE MANY ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES FOR COMBATTING CHRONIC PAIN. THIS REVIEW AIMS TO OVERVIEW THE ARTICLES ABOUT THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN RA AND SPA. WE SEARCHED PUBMED/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, AND WEB OF SCIENCE FOR ENGLISH-LANGUAGE SOURCES FROM THEIR INCEPTION THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2017. CASE-CONTROL STUDIES, INTERVENTIONAL STUDIES, AND CASE SERIES THAT INCLUDED MORE THAN THREE CASES AND RANDOMIZED CROSSOVER STUDIES WERE INCLUDED. THE LITERATURE SEARCH RETRIEVED 133 NON-DUPLICATE RECORDS, AND 15 OF THEM WERE ELIGIBLE AND WERE INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW. THE INFLUENCE OF TAI CHI REMAINS DEBATABLE IN RA, WHILE THERE IS ONLY ONE STUDY THAT INVESTIGATED ITS EFFICACY IN SPA. YOGA SEEMS EFFECTIVE IN DECREASING PAIN AND INFLAMMATION WHILE INCREASING QUALITY OF LIFE. THERE ARE NO DATA AVAILABLE ABOUT ITS EFFECT ON SPA. EVEN AFTER A THOROUGH RESEARCH, THE NUMBER OF ARTICLES IS QUITE LIMITED ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TAI CHI AND YOGA IN RA AND SPA. WHILE THESE COMPLEMENTARY APPROACHES STILL SHOW SOME PROMISE AS ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES IN RA AND SPA, THE LITERATURE LACKS LONG-TERM STUDIES WITH LARGER PATIENT GROUPS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
12 1186  29 EVIDENCE BASED EFFECTS OF YOGA IN NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS. THOUGH YOGA IS ONE OF THE WIDELY USED MIND-BODY MEDICINE FOR HEALTH PROMOTION, DISEASE PREVENTION AND AS A POSSIBLE TREATMENT MODALITY FOR NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS, THERE IS A LACK OF EVIDENCE-BASED REVIEW. HENCE, WE PERFORMED A COMPREHENSIVE SEARCH IN THE PUBMED/MEDLINE ELECTRONIC DATABASE TO REVIEW RELEVANT ARTICLES IN ENGLISH, USING KEYWORDS "YOGA AND NEUROLOGICAL DISORDER, YOGA AND MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, YOGA AND STROKE, YOGA AND EPILEPSY, YOGA AND PARKINSON'S DISEASE, YOGA AND DEMENTIA, YOGA AND CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE, YOGA AND ALZHEIMER DISEASE, YOGA AND NEUROPATHY, YOGA AND MYELOPATHY, AND YOGA AND GUILLAIN-BARRE SYNDROME". A TOTAL OF 700 ARTICLES PUBLISHED FROM 1963 TO 14TH DECEMBER 2016 WERE AVAILABLE. OF 700 ARTICLES, 94 ARTICLES WERE INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE LITERATURE, IT COULD BE CONCLUDED THAT YOGA MIGHT BE CONSIDERED AS AN EFFECTIVE ADJUVANT FOR THE PATIENTS WITH VARIOUS NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS.	2017

14 2446  37 YOGA AND TAI CHI: A MIND-BODY APPROACH IN MANAGING RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS IN OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASES. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD) IS CHARACTERIZED BY AIRFLOW LIMITATION BECAUSE OF AIRWAY AND/OR ALVEOLAR ABNORMALITIES. SYMPTOMS INCLUDE DYSPNEA, COUGH, CHRONIC SPUTUM PRODUCTION. AS THE THIRD-RANKED CAUSE OF DEATH AS WELL AS DISABILITY-ADJUSTED LIFE YEARS (DALYS), IT POSES A SIGNIFICANT BURDEN ON PATIENTS, FAMILIES, HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AND SOCIETY. REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS LINKED TO DECREASE IN MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY ASSOCIATED WITH COPD, BUT IMPLEMENTATION REMAINS CHALLENGING. THERE IS A NEED FOR COMMUNITY-BASED INTERVENTIONS THAT PROMOTE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. YOGA AND TAI CHI ARE WIDELY AVAILABLE IN THE COMMUNITY AND HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE BENEFICIAL IN PATIENTS WITH COPD AS WELL AS MANY OF THE CO-MORBID CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH COPD. RECENT FINDINGS: YOGA AND TAI CHI HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN USUAL CARE IN COPD WITH CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL IMPROVEMENTS IN 6-MIN WALK DISTANCE (6MWD), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1 S (FEV1), AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL). THEY HAVE ALSO BEEN FOUND TO BE COMPARABLE TO PULMONARY REHABILITATION INTERVENTIONS. SUMMARY: YOGA AND TAI CHI PROVIDE COMMUNITY-BASED OPTIONS FOR PATIENTS WITH COPD TO IMPROVE THEIR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND PULMONARY FUNCTION.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
15 1202  28 EXERCISE, YOGA, AND TAI CHI FOR TREATMENT OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER IN OUTPATIENT SETTINGS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVE: EXERCISE, YOGA, AND TAI CHI ARE COMMONLY USED COMPLEMENTARY APPROACHES FOR HEALTH AND WELLNESS. THIS REVIEW AIMS TO SYNTHESIZE THE EVIDENCE FOR EXERCISE, YOGA, AND TAI CHI IN THE OUTPATIENT TREATMENT OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER. STUDY SELECTION: A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH OF THE OVID MEDLINE, EMBASE, PSYCINFO, AND COCHRANE DATABASES WAS CONDUCTED FOR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS OF EXERCISE, YOGA, AND TAI CHI FOR MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER. DATA EXTRACTION: STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCES WERE CALCULATED AND META-ANALYZED USING A RANDOM EFFECTS MULTILEVEL MODELING FRAMEWORK. HETEROGENEITY AND SUBGROUP ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED. RESULTS: TWENTY-FIVE STUDIES WERE INCLUDED FOR FINAL ANALYSIS (EXERCISE: 15, YOGA: 7, TAI CHI: 3). OVERALL, META-ANALYSIS SHOWED A MODERATE SIGNIFICANT CLINICAL EFFECT. HOWEVER, WHEN ONLY STUDIES (6 STUDIES) WITH THE LOWEST RISK OF BIAS WERE INCLUDED, THE OVERALL EFFECT SIZE WAS REDUCED TO LOW TO MODERATE EFFICACY. OVERALL QUALITY OF EVIDENCE WAS LOW. HETEROGENEITY AND PUBLICATION BIAS WERE HIGH. CONCLUSIONS: THE CURRENT META-ANALYSIS OF OUTPATIENT EXERCISE, YOGA, AND TAI CHI FOR TREATMENT OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER SUGGESTS THAT ADJUNCTIVE EXERCISE AND YOGA MAY HAVE SMALL ADDITIVE CLINICAL EFFECTS IN COMPARISON TO CONTROL FOR REDUCING DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. THE EVIDENCE FOR TAI CHI IS INSUFFICIENT TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS. THE CONCERNS WITH QUALITY OF STUDIES, HIGH HETEROGENEITY, AND EVIDENCE OF PUBLICATION BIAS PRECLUDE MAKING FIRM CONCLUSIONS.	2020

19 1689  29 OVERVIEW OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS: YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION FOR ADULTS WITH ACUTE AND CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS. OBJECTIVES. OVERVIEW THE QUALITY, DIRECTION, AND CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR TREATMENT OF ACUTE AND CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS IN ADULT POPULATIONS. METHODS. WE SEARCHED FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS IN 10 ONLINE DATABASES, BIBLIOGRAPHIC REFERENCES, AND HAND-SEARCHES IN YOGA-RELATED JOURNALS. INCLUDED REVIEWS SATISFY OXMAN CRITERIA AND SPECIFY YOGA AS A PRIMARY INTERVENTION IN ONE OR MORE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS FOR TREATMENT IN ADULTS. THE AMSTAR TOOL AND GRADE APPROACH EVALUATED THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF REVIEWS AND QUALITY OF EVIDENCE. RESULTS. WE IDENTIFIED 2202 TITLES, OF WHICH 41 FULL-TEXT ARTICLES WERE ASSESSED FOR ELIGIBILITY AND 26 SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS SATISFIED INCLUSION CRITERIA. THIRTEEN SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS INCLUDE QUANTITATIVE DATA AND SIX PAPERS INCLUDE META-ANALYSIS. THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE IS GENERALLY LOW. SIXTEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF HEALTH CONDITIONS ARE INCLUDED. ELEVEN REVIEWS SHOW TENDENCY TOWARDS POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTION, 15 REVIEWS REPORT UNCLEAR RESULTS, AND NO, REVIEWS REPORT ADVERSE EFFECTS OF YOGA. YOGA APPEARS MOST EFFECTIVE FOR REDUCING SYMPTOMS IN ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND PAIN. CONCLUSION. ALTHOUGH THE QUALITY OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS IS HIGH, THE QUALITY OF SUPPORTING EVIDENCE IS LOW. SIGNIFICANT HETEROGENEITY AND VARIABILITY IN REPORTING INTERVENTIONS BY TYPE OF YOGA, SETTINGS, AND POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS LIMIT THE GENERALIZABILITY OF RESULTS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
20 2013  34 SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA: A BREATH OF HOPE DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC. IMPORTANT COUNTER MEASURES TO COMBAT AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE PANDEMIC INCLUDE VACCINATION, ANTIVIRAL THERAPY, AND IMMUNOMODULATION THERAPY. VACCINATIONS ARE DISEASE SPECIFIC AND MOREOVER STRAIN SPECIFIC, SO THE PROTECTION PROVIDED IS ALSO SPECIFIC AND LIMITED. ANTIVIRAL THERAPIES ARE COSTLY AND REQUIRE BULK PRODUCTION OF DRUGS, HENCE GLOBALLY THERE IS AN INCREASED INTEREST TOWARD LOW-RISK, COST-EFFECTIVE COMPLEMENTARY ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES, SUCH AS YOGA AND AYURVEDA TO TACKLE THE INFECTIOUS PANDEMIC, CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19). THERE IS CLINICAL EVIDENCE AVAILABLE ON THE POTENTIAL COMPLEMENTARY ROLE OF YOGIC PRACTICES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF NONCOMMUNICABLE AND COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. VARIOUS ONLINE DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR ARTICLES PUBLISHED BETWEEN 2000 AND 2020. DATABASES EXPLORED WERE MEDLINE, EMBASE, INDIAN CITATION INDEX, PSYCINFO, INDEX MEDICUS FOR SOUTH-EAST ASIA REGION, AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR. ALL SEARCH RESULTS WERE SCREENED, AND ARTICLES RELATED TO KEYWORDS SUCH AS COVID-19, YOGA THERAPY, AND SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA (SKY) WERE SELECTED FOR DATA EXTRACTION. QUALITY OF THE STUDIES INCLUDED WAS EVALUATED ON THE BASIS OF THE CONSTRUCT VALIDITY, CONTENT VALIDITY, RELEVANCE, BIAS, CREDIBILITY RELATING TO INFORMATION, AND DATA SOURCES. SKY IS A UNIQUE YOGIC PRACTICE THAT INCLUDES SPECIFIC SEQUENTIAL BREATHING TECHNIQUES.

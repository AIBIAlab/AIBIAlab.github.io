1 1713 105 PERCEIVED EXERTION AND AFFECT FROM TAI CHI, YOGA, AND STRETCHING CLASSES FOR ELDERLY WOMEN. TAI CHI, YOGA, AND STRETCHING REGIMENS ARE GAINING POPULARITY AS ALTERNATIVES TO MORE TRADITIONAL EXERCISE, BUT THERE IS SCANT RESEARCH REGARDING PARTICIPANTS' PERCEIVED EXERTION AND AFFECTIVE RESPONSES TO THESE PRACTICES. WE COMPARED EXPERIENCED STATES OF PERCEIVED EXERTION, FEELINGS OF PLEASURE/DISPLEASURE, AND AROUSAL IN 70 ELDERLY WOMEN ENROLLED IN GROUPS OF TAI CHI ( N = 26), YOGA ( N = 25), OR STRETCHING ( N = 19) CLASSES. MEAN RATES OF PERCEIVED EXERTION, FEELINGS OF PLEASURE, AND AROUSAL RESPONSES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER OVER THE TIME COURSE OF ALL THREE GROUPS, WHILE THE OVERALL MEAN PERCEIVED EXERTION ( SOMEWHAT HARD ON THE BORG CR-10 SCALE) AND PLEASURE RESPONSES ( APPROXIMATELY VERY GOOD ON THE FEELING SCALE) WERE SIMILAR BETWEEN THEM. THE CIRCUMPLEX MODEL OF AFFECT SHOWED THAT CHANGES OCCURRED IN THE HIGH-ACTIVATION PLEASURE QUADRANT (ENERGY ON THE FELT AROUSAL SCALE). FROM A PRACTICAL PERSPECTIVE, THE EXERCISE INTENSITY AND AFFECTIVE RESPONSES ELICITED DURING THESE CLASSES MADE PARTICIPANTS FEEL GOOD AND INFUSED WITH ENERGY, LIKELY CREATING A POSITIVE MEMORY AND REINFORCING CONTINUED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PARTICIPATION.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
2 1894  30 RESEARCH TRENDS IN THE APPLICATION OF YOGA TO HUMAN HEALTH: A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH. YOGA IS AN INTEGRATIVE MIND-BODY SYSTEM OF WELLBEING DEVELOPED IN INDIA SINCE AT LEAST THREE MILLENNIA. YOGA HAS GAINED CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION IN RECENT DECADES, PARTLY DRIVEN BY RECENT RESEARCH AND EVIDENCE ABOUT ITS EFFECTIVENESS. IN THIS WORK, WE EXTRACTED RESEARCH TRENDS ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON HUMAN HEALTH FROM THE US NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE'S PUBMED DATABASE (PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL PAPERS). WE FOUND THAT YOGA RESEARCH SPANS ALL ORGAN SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM-WIDE ISSUES SUCH AS PAIN AND CANCER. RESEARCH ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM FAR OUTPACES OTHER SYSTEMS, WHICH IS EXPECTED BECAUSE OF THE EFFECTS OF BREATHING AND EXERCISE ON STRESS REDUCTION, WHICH HAS BEEN A MAJOR APPLICATION OF YOGA. THE NEXT CLUSTER OF IMPACT CONCERNS THE MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM AND PAIN (BOTH RELATED TO THE EXERCISE [ASANA] ASPECTS OF YOGA), AS WELL AS CARDIOVASCULAR/ENDOCRINE (ALSO RELATED TO STRESS) AND CANCER. STRESS AND MENTAL HEALTH, PAIN, DIABETES, AND CANCER ARE HEALTH ISSUES FOR WHICH A PERMANENT CURE IS NOT AVAILABLE IN A MAJORITY OF CASES IN MODERN MEDICINE, ALTHOUGH ALLEVIATING TREATMENTS ARE AVAILABLE. THIS HAS PROBABLY FUELED INTEREST IN COMPLEMENTARY APPROACHES SUCH AS YOGA FOR THESE HEALTH ISSUES. RESEARCH TIMELINE SHOWS THAT YOGA-RELATED RESEARCH LARGELY EXPANDED ONLY AFTER THE 2000S. THERE WAS A SPECIFIC UPTICK AFTER 2004. SIMILAR TRENDS ARE SEEN IF WE LOOK AT JUST CLINICAL TRIALS OR RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS (RCTS) OR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS. THE PERCENTAGE OF TRIALS (CLINICAL AND RCT) AMONG PUBLISHED LITERATURE IS AROUND 10-15 % THIS IS COMPARABLE TO OTHER FIELDS THAT GAINED TRACTION AROUND 2000S (E.G. NON-INVASIVE BRAIN STIMULATION). GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION SHOWS THAT 37% OF ALL YOGA RELATED RESEARCH OUTPUT ORIGINATES IN THE USA, 19% FROM INDIA, 13% FROM EUROPE AND 31% FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD. THEREFORE, THE INTEREST IS WIDESPREAD AND GLOBAL. AT LEAST THE UPTICK IN YOGA-RELATED RESEARCH IN THE US POST-2000S CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO A SUBSTANTIAL JUMP IN FUNDING BETWEEN 1998 AND 2005 FROM US NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH'S NATIONAL CENTER FOR COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH (NCCIH). WE CAN ONLY SURMISE THAT RESEARCH IN THIS FIELD REACHED A CRITICAL MASS IN LATE-1990S, WHICH INFUSED MORE MONEY INTO THIS FIELD, GENERATING MORE RESEARCH AND CREATING A POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOP THAT HAS SUSTAINED THE GROWTH SO FAR. WE PROPOSE THAT IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN OR EVEN ACCELERATE FUTURE RESEARCH IN THE AREA, RIGOR AND REPRODUCIBILITY MUST BE ENHANCED IN ADDITION TO PERFORMING MORE RCT AND CLINICAL TRIALS (INCREASING % OF TRIALS TO 20-25% FROM 10-15%). THE FRUITS OF RESEARCH IN THE FIELD HAS TO REACH THE COMMON MAN IN TERMS OF EVIDENCE-BASED SOLUTIONS TO HEALTH ISSUES. WITHOUT THIS, ACCELERATED FUNDING IN DEMOCRACIES SUCH AS INDIA AND THE USA WILL NOT BE REALIZABLE.	2020	

3 1958  23 SELF-MANAGEMENT AND YOGA FOR OLDER ADULTS WITH CHRONIC STROKE: A MIXED-METHODS STUDY OF PHYSICAL FITNESS AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED CHANGES IN PHYSICAL FITNESS AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AMONG OLDER PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC STROKE (STROKE >/= 6 MONTHS PREVIOUS) AFTER PARTICIPATION IN A YOGA INFUSED SELF-MANAGEMENT INTERVENTION. METHODS: A MIXED-METHODS SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS EXAMINED QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF ENDURANCE, STRENGTH, AND GAIT SPEED AND QUALITATIVE PERSPECTIVES OF INTERVENTION PARTICIPANTS. RESULTS: BASED ON WILCOXON ANALYSIS, PHYSICAL FITNESS OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDING ENDURANCE AND LOWER AND UPPER BODY STRENGTH SIGNIFICANTLY (P < .02) IMPROVED. BASED ON QUALITATIVE RESULTS OF 2 FOCUS GROUPS AND 14 INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS, PARTICIPANTS EXPRESSED POSITIVE CHANGES IN ENDURANCE, STRENGTH, GAIT SPEED, FLEXIBILITY, AND BALANCE. THEY ALSO REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN WALKING ABILITY AND DURATION, AND EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO CONTINUE YOGA AND INCREASE LEVELS OF EXERCISE. CONCLUSIONS: WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF IMPROVING PHYSICAL FITNESS AND EXERCISE FOR OLDER ADULTS WITH CHRONIC STROKE, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR SELF-MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS TO PROVIDE SPECIFIC SAFE AND FEASIBLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY COMPONENTS, SUCH AS YOGA. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: HEALTH PROFESSIONALS MAY IMPROVE OFFERED CHRONIC STROKE SELF-MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS BY INCORPORATING YOGA.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
4  403  19 BIBLIOMETRIC PROFILE AND DENSITY VISUALIZING ANALYSIS OF YOGA INTERVENTION IN TYPE 2 DIABETES: A 44 - YEAR STUDY ON GLOBAL SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH OUTPUT FROM 1975 TO 2019. THE AIM OF THE PAPER IS TO PROVIDE AN IN-DEPTH EVALUATION OF THE RESEARCH OUTPUT OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS FROM 1975 TO 2019 USING LARGE-SCALE DATA ANALYSIS, BIBLIOMETRIC INDICATORS, AND DENSITY EQUALIZING MAPPING. DATA RELATED TO YOGA-DIABETIC RESEARCH, AS SEARCH DESCRIPTORS WERE RETRIEVED USING THE SCOPUS DATABASE. THE MOST COMMON BIBLIOMETRIC INDICATORS WERE ANNUAL RESEARCH OUTPUT, TOTAL CITATIONS, PRODUCTIVE COUNTRIES AND LEADING AUTHORS, JOURNALS AND INSTITUTIONS, AND FREQUENTLY CITED ARTICLES. THE NUMBER OF GLOBAL RESEARCH ARTICLES RETRIEVED FOR YOGA-DIABETIC RESEARCH OVER THE STUDY PERIOD 1975-2019 WAS 411. THE GROWTH RATE OF GLOBAL PUBLICATIONS IN 2015-2019 IS FOUR TIMES AS HIGH AS IN 1975-2003. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CITATIONS FOR THE RETRIEVED ARTICLES WAS 7189, AND THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF CITATIONS PER ARTICLE WAS 23.82. OF THESE JOURNALS, THE JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE HAS PUBLISHED THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF PAPERS, WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR 2.9% OF TOTAL PUBLICATIONS. THIS STUDY SHOWED A WIDE VARIETY OF JOURNALS IN WHICH YOGA-DIABETIC ARTICLES ARE PUBLISHED; THESE BIBLIOMETRIC INDICATORS PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION ON PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT OF PRODUCTIVITY AND QUALITY OF RESEARCH OUTPUT. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY PROVIDES A HELPFUL REFERENCE FOR ENDOCRINOLOGISTS, YOGA THERAPISTS, POLICY DECISION-MAKERS, AND DIABETES RESEARCHERS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
5 1284  23 GOT YOGA?: A LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS OF THEMATIC CONTENT AND MODELS' APPEARANCE-RELATED ATTRIBUTES IN ADVERTISEMENTS SPANNING FOUR DECADES OF YOGA JOURNAL. YOGA HAS BECOME AN INCREASINGLY COMMON HEALTH PRACTICE AMONG U.S. ADULTS OVER THE PAST DECADE. WITH THIS GROWTH IN POPULARITY, YOGA-RELATED PRINT MEDIA HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED FOR SHIFTING AWAY FROM YOGA'S TRADITIONAL PHILOSOPHIES AND PROMOTING A THIN, LEAN IDEAL PHYSIQUE REPRESENTING THE "YOGA BODY." THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO (A) ANALYZE THE PRESENCE AND CONTENT OF ADVERTISEMENTS OVER THE 40-YEAR PUBLICATION HISTORY OF YOGA JOURNAL MAGAZINE AND (B) EXPLORE FEMALE ADVERTISEMENT MODELS' SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC AND APPEARANCE-RELATED ATTRIBUTES OVER TIME. RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT YOGA JOURNAL NOW CONTAINS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ADVERTISEMENTS FOR FOOD, NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS, AND APPAREL AND FEWER ADVERTISEMENTS FOR MEDITATION AND NUTRITIONAL PRACTICES THAN IN ITS EARLY YEARS OF PUBLICATION. MODELS WERE MORE FREQUENTLY RATED AS WHITE AND IN THEIR 20S AND 30S IN RECENT YEARS OF PUBLICATION. TRENDS IN MODEL BODY SIZE MATCHED SHIFTS IN CULTURALLY DOMINANT BODY IDEALS OVER TIME.

6 2042  20 THE 'WORLD OF YOGA': THE PRODUCTION AND REPRODUCTION OF THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPES. YOGA IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE FASHIONABLE ALL AROUND THE WORLD. THIS ACTIVITY, PARTLY CONSIDERED AS THERAPEUTIC, REVEALS CONTEMPORARY WAYS OF PRODUCING GLOBAL PRACTICES. VIA A QUESTIONNAIRE COMPLETED BY INDIVIDUALS AT YOGA CENTRES IN INDIA AND FRANCE, THE PAPER ANALYSES THIS PHENOMENON USING THE CONCEPT OF THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPES. FURTHERMORE, IT EXAMINES HOW THESE THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPES ARE INFLUENCED BY GLOBALISATION. BRINGING TOGETHER THE CONCEPTS OF THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPES, GLOBALISATION AND THE PRACTICE OF YOGA, THE PAPER ANALYSES THE PRODUCTION AND REPRODUCTION OF YOGIC THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPES IN THE WORLD'S SPACE. CONSTITUTED OF NATURAL PHYSICAL ELEMENTS AND BUILT STRUCTURES, THESE THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPES ARE ALSO STRONGLY LINKED TO EMOTIONAL QUALITIES AND INTIMATE FEELINGS EVOKED BY THE PLACE AND RELATED TO HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. THE PAPER ALSO UNDERLINES THAT THE EMERGENCE OF INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNISED THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPES DEMANDS A CULTURAL AND SOCIAL GEOGRAPHICAL APPROACH THAT COULD HELP TO EXAMINE THE REPERCUSSIONS OF LOCAL AND GLOBAL PHENOMENA ON THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPES. INDEED, VERY OFTEN, YOGIS, ALL AROUND THE WORLD, REFER TO IDEAL PLACES WHERE THEY RARELY GO. CONSEQUENTLY, THEY CREATE AN IMAGINED THERAPEUTIC ENVIRONMENT THAT THE PAPER DESCRIBES.	2007

8 2121  21 THE EFFECTIVENESS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF PREGNANCY YOGA INTERVENTIONS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW PROTOCOL. BACKGROUND: THE PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW IS TO SYSTEMATICALLY EXAMINE THE REPORTED CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF PREGNANCY YOGA. THE REVIEW WILL USE THE FITT (FREQUENCY, INTENSITY, TIME/DURATION AND TYPE) PRINCIPLE OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO CHARACTERISE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN EVALUATED IN THE INCLUDED STUDIES. STUDIES WILL BE CATEGORISED AS EFFECTIVENESS OR EFFICACY STUDIES AND THIS CONTINUUM OF EFFICACY VERSUS EFFECTIVENESS WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE FULL REVIEW. METHODS/DESIGN: THE FOLLOWING ELECTRONIC DATABASES WILL BE SEARCHED USING A DETAILED SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, WHOLIS, AMED, SCIELO, ASSIA AND WEB OF SCIENCE. RANDOMISED CONTROL TRIALS AND QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES EXAMINING PREGNANCY YOGA AND REPORTING ON EFFECT WILL BE INCLUDED. TITLES, ABSTRACTS AND FULL ARTICLES WILL BE SCREENED BY TWO INVESTIGATORS INDEPENDENTLY TO IDENTIFY ELIGIBLE STUDIES. THE COCHRANE COLLABORATION'S RISK OF BIAS ASSESSMENT TOOL WILL BE USED TO ASSESS STUDY QUALITY. QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE WILL BE EVALUATED USING THE GRADE CRITERIA. A STANDARDISED DATA EXTRACTION FORM WILL BE USED TO EXTRACT DATA. EFFECT SIZES WILL BE ESTIMATED USING MEAN DIFFERENCES FOR CONTINUOUS OUTCOMES, AND RELATIVE RISKS FOR DICHOTOMOUS OUTCOME. WHERE POSSIBLE, POOLING OF EFFECT ESTIMATES WILL BE DONE USING A RANDOM EFFECT MODEL. THE OUTCOMES OF INTEREST ARE QUALITY OF LIFE, STRESS, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, MODE OF BIRTH, LABOUR DURATION AND PAIN MANAGEMENT IN LABOUR. DISCUSSION: THIS REVIEW WILL SYNTHESISE THE BEST AVAILABLE EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA DURING PREGNANCY AND PROVIDE VALUABLE HIGH-QUALITY INFORMATION FOR CLINICIANS AND HEALTH POLICYMAKERS. FINDINGS WILL BE DISSEMINATED THROUGH PUBLICATION IN A PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL AND PRESENTATION AT RELEVANT CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS. THE REVIEW WILL MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE APPROPRIATE VOLUME, INTENSITY AND TYPE OF PREGNANCY YOGA FOR MAXIMUM EFFECT AND MAY HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND PRACTICE RELATING TO PREGNANCY YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION.

9 1294  18 GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPING YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR RANDOMIZED TRIALS. LITTLE GUIDANCE IS AVAILABLE TO ASSIST RESEARCHERS IN DEVELOPING TREATMENT PROTOCOLS FOR RESEARCH ON YOGA FOR HEALTH CONCERNS. BECAUSE YOGA IS A COMPLEX MULTIFACTORIAL MIND-BODY DISCIPLINE HISTORICALLY DEVELOPED FOR NONMEDICAL PURPOSES, NUMEROUS DECISIONS MUST BE MADE IN ORDER TO THOUGHTFULLY DEVELOP SUCH PROTOCOLS. IN THIS PAPER, A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH IS PROPOSED TO ASSIST RESEARCHERS IN SELECTING AN INTERVENTION THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE CONDITION UNDER CONSIDERATION AND EXPLICITLY DEVELOPED. RESEARCHERS NEED TO CONSIDER THE TYPE OR "STYLE" OF YOGA, THE COMPONENTS TO INCLUDE (E.G., BREATHING EXERCISES, POSTURES) AS WELL AS THE SPECIFIC PROTOCOL FOR EACH COMPONENT, THE DOSE TO BE DELIVERED (FREQUENCY, DURATION OF PRACTICE, AND THE TOTAL DURATION OF PRACTICE), AND ISSUES RELATED TO SELECTION OF INSTRUCTORS AND MONITORING THE FIDELITY TO THE INTERVENTION. EACH OF THESE DOMAINS AND THE KEY ISSUES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROTOCOLS IS DISCUSSED. FINALLY, SOME AREAS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH RELATED TO PROTOCOL DEVELOPMENT ARE RECOMMENDED.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
10 2466  16 YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION: A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF PUBLISHED RESEARCH STUDIES. ALTHOUGH YOGA IS HISTORICALLY A SPIRITUAL DISCIPLINE, IT HAS ALSO BEEN USED CLINICALLY AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION. A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS ON THE BIOMEDICAL JOURNAL LITERATURE INVOLVING RESEARCH ON THE CLINICAL APPLICATION OF YOGA HAS REVEALED AN INCREASE IN PUBLICATION FREQUENCY OVER THE PAST 3 DECADES WITH A SUBSTANTIAL AND GROWING USE OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. TYPES OF MEDICAL CONDITIONS HAVE INCLUDED PSYCHOPATHOLOGICAL (E.G. DEPRESSION, ANXIETY), CARDIOVASCULAR (E.G. HYPERTENSION, HEART DISEASE), RESPIRATORY (E.G. ASTHMA), DIABETES AND A VARIETY OF OTHERS. A MAJORITY OF THIS RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONDUCTED BY INDIAN INVESTIGATORS AND PUBLISHED IN INDIAN JOURNALS, PARTICULARLY YOGA SPECIALTY JOURNALS, ALTHOUGH RECENT TRENDS INDICATE INCREASING CONTRIBUTIONS FROM INVESTIGATORS IN THE U.S. AND ENGLAND. YOGA THERAPY IS A RELATIVELY NOVEL AND EMERGING CLINICAL DISCIPLINE WITHIN THE BROAD CATEGORY OF MIND-BODY MEDICINE, WHOSE GROWTH IS CONSISTENT WITH THE BURGEONING POPULARITY OF YOGA IN THE WEST AND THE INCREASING WORLDWIDE USE OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE.	2004	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
11 1518  25 IS YOGA CONSIDERED EXERCISE WITHIN SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS? A SCOPING REVIEW. OBJECTIVE: YOGA IS AN INCREASINGLY POPULAR CHOICE OF EXERCISE FOR THE WESTERN POPULATION, WITH PEOPLE ENGAGING IN YOGA FOR A RANGE OF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING REASONS. THE AIM OF THIS SCOPING REVIEW IS TO EXAMINE WHETHER YOGA IS CONSIDERED AN EXERCISE MODALITY WITHIN RELEVANT LEADING JOURNALS, AS EVIDENCED BY ITS CONSIDERATION IN SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS (SRS) OF EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS FOR HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOMES. METHODS: DESIGN: SCOPING REVIEW. DATA SOURCES: THREE LEADING SOURCES (SPORTS MEDICINE, BRITISH JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE AND COCHRANE COLLABORATION) WERE SEARCHED. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: THE TEN MOST RECENTLY PUBLISHED SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS FOR HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOMES FROM EACH JOURNAL WERE INCLUDED (N = 30) THAT MET THESE CRITERIA: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW STUDYING HUMANS PARTICIPATING IN GENERAL EXERCISE AND MEASURING A HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOME. EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS WITH ANY SPECIFIC QUALIFYING TERMS (E.G. AQUATIC, STRENGTH, AEROBIC) WERE EXCLUDED. RESULTS: THE ARTICLES RETRIEVED WERE PUBLISHED BETWEEN 2007 AND 2019, AND COLLECTIVELY INCLUDED 991 INTERVENTIONS. SEVEN REVIEWS EXPLICITLY STATED THAT YOGA WAS TO BE INCLUDED/EXCLUDED WHILE TWENTY-THREE STUDIES MADE NO MENTION OF HOW YOGA WAS BEING CONSIDERED IN THE METHODOLOGY. FIVE STUDIES INCLUDED YOGA IN THE SEARCH STRATEGY, IMPLYING ITS INCLUSION. POST-HOC ANALYSES FOUND THAT THE DEFINITIONS OF EXERCISE IN GENERAL WERE ALSO VARIABLE. EXERCISE DEFINITION SPECIFICITY WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH WHETHER OR NOT YOGA WAS ASSESSED FOR INCLUSION. CONCLUSIONS: SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF EXERCISE AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY INTERVENTIONS FOR HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOMES DO NOT CONSISTENTLY MAKE CLEAR WHETHER OR NOT THEY INCLUDE OR EXCLUDE YOGA AS A FORM OF EXERCISE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
12  129  28 A POPULATION-PRACTICE-BASED MODEL TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOGA IMPACTS ON HUMAN GLOBAL FUNCTIONING: A QUALITATIVE STUDY. INTRODUCTION:RESEARCH IS INCREASINGLY DEMONSTRATING A RANGE OF BENEFITS OF PRACTICING YOGA, SUCH AS IMPROVED PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH, SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS, AND SELF-CARE. MECHANISMS OF ACTION ARE LESS WELL UNDERSTOOD, BUT MAY INCLUDE BOTH PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT BENEFITS AND MECHANISMS OF YOGA PRACTICE, USING QUALITATIVE DATA COLLECTED FROM A LARGE-SCALE SURVEY OF YOGA USE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. METHODS: THE MIXED METHODS, CROSS-SECTIONAL ONLINE SURVEY COLLECTED DATA ON YOGA USE AND PERCEIVED BENEFITS FROM 2434 U.K. YOGA PRACTITIONERS. THE QUALITATIVE SURVEY ELEMENT USED OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS TO GAIN "REAL LIFE" DATA REGARDING PRACTICE AND PERCEIVED BENEFITS. DATA WERE ANALYZED THEMATICALLY AND DEDUCTIVELY. A PRACTICE-BASED MODEL DESCRIBING YOGA PRACTICE, MECHANISMS, AND BENEFITS, BASED ON THE KHALSA LOGIC MODEL OF YOGA, WAS DEVELOPED TO EXPLAIN THE DATA. FINDINGS: FINDINGS HIGHLIGHTED THAT A DIVERSE RANGE OF YOGA PRACTICES AND NONSPECIFIC CONTEXTUAL FACTORS RELATED TO PRACTICING YOGA, NEEDED TO BE CONSIDERED TO UNDERSTAND HOW YOGA WAS BENEFITTING PEOPLE. THESE PRACTICES ENCOMPASSED BOTH MODERN AND TRADITIONAL CONCEPTIONS OF YOGA AS A DEEPER LIFESTYLE PRACTICE. KEY MECHANISMS FOR CHANGE INCLUDED IMPROVEMENTS IN PHYSICAL STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY, STRESS REGULATION, RESILIENCE, EQUANIMITY, MIND-BODY AWARENESS, AND SPIRITUAL/PERSONAL GROWTH. THESE MECHANISMS RESULTED IN DIVERSE IMPROVEMENTS IN GLOBAL HEALTH FUNCTIONING, PARTICULARLY PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. CONCLUSIONS: THE KHALSA MODEL PROVIDED A USEFUL BASE UPON WHICH TO GUIDE THE NEW POPULATION-PRACTICE-BASED MODEL, TO UNDERSTAND PARTICIPANTS' "REAL LIFE" EXPERIENCES OF YOGA, HOW YOGA IS HELPING PEOPLE AND WHY. IT PROVIDES IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR PRACTITIONERS, TEACHERS, AND THOSE DELIVERING YOGA INTERVENTIONS AS TO THE RANGE OF SKILLS AND POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE. IN ADDITION, FINDINGS INDICATE DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH, BY HIGHLIGHTING KEY YOGA MECHANISMS THAT RESEARCHERS MAY CHOOSE TO FOCUS ON IN FUTURE STUDIES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
13  143  28 A PUBMED-BASED EXPLORATION OF THE COURSE OF YOGA RESEARCH FROM 1948 TO 2020. YOGA RESEARCH CITATIONS FROM 1948 TO 2020 IN PUBMED WERE FILTERED AND SORTED IN 10-YEAR INTERVALS TO EXPLORE THE OCCURRENCE AND TIME FRAME OF CHANGE IN (1) THE FOCUS OF RESEARCH; (2) THE NUMBER OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS), SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS (SRS), AND META-ANALYSES (MAS); (3) HEALTH CONDITIONS RESEARCHED FOR YOGA AS THERAPY; (4) JOURNALS WITH YOGA RESEARCH; AND (5) THE RESEARCH ON YOGA FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. PUBLICATIONS ON YOGA BETWEEN 1948 AND 1970 (1.25%) FOCUSED ON EXCEPTIONAL ABILITIES OF EXPERIENCED YOGA PRACTITIONERS, APPARENTLY RELATED TO THE SPIRITUAL GOAL OF YOGA; FROM 1971 TO 2000 (6.87%), THE FOCUS WAS ON YOGA IN HEALTH AND THERAPY; AND FROM 2001 TO 2020 (91.88%), RESEARCH PUBLICATIONS ON YOGA INCREASED AND CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON HEALTH AND THERAPY, WITH FEWER RCTS RELATIVE TO THE SRS AND MAS ON YOGA IN PUBMED. PUBLICATIONS ON YOGA REPORTED THE FOLLOWING HEALTH CONDITIONS MOST OFTEN: FROM 1981 TO 1990, (1) ASTHMA, (2) STRESS, AND (3) DIABETES; FROM 1991 TO 2000, (1) STRESS FOLLOWED BY (2) ASTHMA, ANXIETY, AND PAIN (ALL THREE WITH EQUAL PERCENTAGES); FROM 2001 TO 2010, (1) DEPRESSION, (2) STRESS, AND (3) ANXIETY; AND FROM 2011 TO 2020, (1) STRESS, (2) DEPRESSION, AND (3) PAIN. THE JOURNALS PUBLISHING RESEARCH ON YOGA IN PUBMED HAVE CHANGED BETWEEN 1971 AND 2020 AS FOLLOWS: HIGHLY CLINICALLY RELEVANT, BROAD-INTEREST MEDICAL JOURNALS (1971 TO 1990); JOURNALS RELEVANT TO MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS (1991 TO 2000); AND SPECIALIZED JOURNALS FOR COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE, PARTICULAR BRANCHES OF MEDICINE, OR RESEARCH STUDY DESIGNS (2001 TO 2020). THE HIGHEST YOGA RESEARCH OUTPUT FROM 1971 TO 1980 CAME FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM (RCTS); FROM 1981 TO 1990 THE MOST RESEARCH CAME FROM THE UNITED STATES (RCTS); FROM 1991 TO 2000 THE MOST RESEARCH CAME FROM INDIA (RCTS) AND THE UNITED KINGDOM (SRS); FROM 2001 TO 2010 THE MOST RESEARCH CAME FROM THE UNITED STATES (RCTS, SRS) AND THE UNITED KINGDOM (MAS); AND FROM 2011 TO 2020 THE MOST RESEARCH CAME FROM THE UNITED STATES (RCTS, SRS, MAS). THE TRENDS IN YOGA RESEARCH FROM THIS ANALYSIS REFLECT INCREASED RESEARCH RELATED TO YOGA AND HEALTH WHILE SUGGESTING AREAS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH BASED ON THE STRENGTHS AND GAPS THAT HAVE EMERGED.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
14 2130  24 THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA TO PREVENT DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2: A PROTOCOL FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM) IS BECOMING A LEADING PROBLEM WORLDWIDE. EMERGING REPORTS REVEAL ALARMING EVIDENCE OF INCREASING PREVALENCE OF T2DM THAT HAS REACHED PANDEMIC LEVELS. DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT INCIDENCE, THERE ARE LIMITED RELIABLE DATA RESOURCES AND COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PEOPLE WHO ARE A PREDIABETIC OR HIGH RISK FOR DEVELOPING T2DM. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROTOCOL IS TO CONDUCT A FULL-SCALE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSES ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PEOPLE WHO ARE PREDIABETES OR HIGH RISK OF DEVELOPING T2DM. METHODS: THE ARTICLES ENROLLED IN THE STUDY WILL BE RETRIEVED FROM THE ONLINE DATABASES BETWEEN 2002 AND THE DATE THE SEARCHES ARE EXECUTED. THE SEARCHES WILL BE REPEATED JUST BEFORE THE FINAL ANALYSES AND FURTHER RELEVANT STUDIES FOR INCLUSION. WE WILL CONDUCT A BIBLIOGRAPHIC SEARCH IN DATABASES: MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, COCHRANE LIBRARY, EBSCO, AND INDMED USING KEYWORDS INCLUDING PREDIABETES STATE, HIGH RISK FOR DIABETES, METABOLIC SYNDROME, AND YOGA. A DEFINED SEARCH STRATEGY WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ALONG WITH SELECTION CRITERIA TO OBTAIN FULL-TEXT ARTICLES OF RELEVANT STUDIES. THIS STUDY PROTOCOL WAS PREPARED ACCORDING TO THE PREFERRED REPORTING ITEMS FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND META-ANALYSIS FOR PROTOCOLS 2015 GUIDELINES. THERE WILL BE NO LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL BE BASED ON PUBLISHED STUDIES AND PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ANONYMIZED DATA WITHOUT DIRECTLY INVOLVING HUMAN PARTICIPANTS AND THEREFORE REQUIRES NEITHER FORMAL HUMAN ETHICAL REVIEW NOR APPROVAL BY A HUMAN RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEE. WE PUBLISHED AN OUTLINE OF THE PROTOCOL IN THE INTERNATIONAL PROSPECTIVE REGISTER OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS (PROSPERO) IN 2018. WE PLAN TO DISSEMINATE THE FINDINGS OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS THROUGH PUBLICATION IN A PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL AND PRESENTATION AT RELEVANT CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS. IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE THE RESULTS OF THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WILL HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND PRACTICE. WE WILL PREPARE POLICYMAKER SUMMARY USING A VALIDATED FORMAT, DISSEMINATE THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA AND EMAIL DISCUSSION GROUPS.

15 2807  22 YOGA THERAPY RESEARCH: A WHOLE-SYSTEMS PERSPECTIVE ON COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS AND PATIENT-CENTERED OUTCOMES. FOR THE YOGA RESEARCH COMMUNITY TO CAPITALIZE ON ITS CURRENT MOMENTUM, IT IS CRITICAL TO CONSIDER CERTAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESEARCH THEORY AND INNOVATIVE METHODOLOGIES. THE CONCEPT OF MODEL VALIDITY MUST BE INCORPORATED IN YOGA THERAPY RESEARCH SO THAT EXPLANATORY CONSTRUCTS EMPLOYED AND OUTCOME MEASURES CHOSEN REFLECT THE PRINCIPLES OF TRADITIONAL YOGIC SCIENCE. FOCUSING ON EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH WILL ENSURE MAXIMUM GENERALIZABILITY OF STUDY RESULTS AND REFLECT REAL-WORLD THERAPY DELIVERY SETTINGS, THEREBY INCREASING THE RELEVANCE OF OUTCOMES. WHOLE SYSTEMS OF HEALING REQUIRE RESEARCH METHODOLOGIES THAT ADDRESS COMPLEX RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MULTI-TARGET THERAPIES WITH MULTIPLE POTENTIAL TREATMENT RESULTS. COMPLEX, DYNAMIC SYSTEMS THEORY PROVIDES THE THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS NECESSARY TO DESIGN STUDIES, CHOOSE OUTCOMES, AND ANALYZE DATA IN A WAY THAT CAN ACCOUNT FOR CHARTING COMPLEX, CYCLICAL, THERAPEUTIC TRAJECTORIES ACROSS TIME. EMPHASIZING PATIENT-CENTERED OUTCOMES IS ALIGNED WITH THE PATENT-ORIENTED AND TAILORED NATURED OF YOGA THERAPY DELIVERY. INCREASING THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH TO ANALYZE THE HARMS AND BENEFITS OF CONTRASTING THERAPIES CAN PROVIDE AN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR DESIGNING STUDIES THAT CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT PRACTICAL IMPACT. THE CREATION OF PRACTICE-BASED RESEARCH NETWORKS WITHIN THE YOGA RESEARCH COMMUNITY WILL INCENTIVIZE LINKS BETWEEN MAINSTREAM CLINICAL RESEARCHERS AND YOGA THERAPY DELIVERY SETTINGS, ULTIMATELY DEVELOPING COLLABORATIVE NETWORKS. YOGA THERAPY CENTERS CAN FACILITATE PATIENT RECRUITMENT FOR STUDIES AND INFORM STANDARDS FOR YOGA RESEARCHERS. COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS BETWEEN THE YOGA AND AYURVEDIC RESEARCH COMMUNITIES WILL STREAMLINE EFFORTS, SOLIDIFY EXPERTISE, CROSS-POLLINATE THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL INNOVATION, AND CONSOLIDATE EFFORTS TO SECURE RESEARCH FUNDING AND INCREASE PUBLICATION AND DISSEMINATION OF STUDY FINDINGS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
16 2482  24 YOGA AS AN ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLIMENTARY THERAPY FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE IS A LEADING CAUSE OF DISABILITY AND DEATH WORLDWIDE. YOGA, A MIND-BODY EXERCISE, UTILIZES BREATHING TECHNIQUES WITH LOW-IMPACT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THAT MAY BE AN ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS TO EXAMINE YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR PATIENTS AT-RISK FOR AND/OR SUFFERING FROM CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. THE INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR INTERVENTIONS WERE ( A) PUBLISHED IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE BETWEEN 2005 AND 2015; ( B) INDEXED IN MEDLINE/PUBMED, CINAHL, OR ALT HEALTHWATCH; ( C) EMPLOYED A QUANTITATIVE DESIGN; AND ( D) APPLIED A YOGA INTERVENTION. TWELVE INTERVENTIONS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA, OF WHICH, ALL DOCUMENTED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN ONE OR MORE FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. LIMITATIONS TO THE STUDIES IN THIS REVIEW INCLUDED A LACK OF STUDIES ADHERING TO THE INCLUSION CRITERIA, SMALL SAMPLE SIZES, AND HIGH ATTRITION RATES. DESPITE THE LIMITATIONS, THIS REVIEW DEMONSTRATES THE CLEAR POTENTIAL YOGA HAS AS AN ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEANS TO IMPROVE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
17 2408  27 YOGA AND HEALTHCARE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM. THE EMERGENCE OF YOGA THERAPY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM BEGAN ABOUT 45 YEARS AGO WITH THE EMERGENCE OF YOGA THERAPY ORGANIZATIONS THAT OFFERED BOTH TREATMENT AND TRAINING. THE INTEGRATION OF YOGA INTO THE NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE (NHS) IS GRADUALLY HAPPENING BECAUSE: (A) YOGA RESEARCH SUPPORTS ITS EFFICACY AS A COST-EFFECTIVE, PREVENTIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR A HOST OF NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES; AND (B) THE ESCALATING ECONOMIC BURDEN OF LONG-TERM CONDITIONS IS OVERWHELMING THE NHS. THE NHS IS ACTIVELY DEVELOPING 'SUSTAINABILITY AND TRANSFORMATION PLANS' THAT INCLUDE YOGA. CHIEF AMONG THESE IS 'SOCIAL PRESCRIBING,' WHICH EMPOWERS PATIENTS WITH COMPLEX HEALTH NEEDS THROUGH ACTIVITIES GROUPS. THESE ACTIVITIES REDUCE SEDENTARY HABITS AND SOCIAL ISOLATION, WHILE HELPING PATIENTS TO BE MORE SELF-RELIANT. THE NHS HAS ALLOCATED POUND450 MILLION IN FUNDING TO IMPLEMENT A VARIETY OF PROGRAMS FOR ITS OWN STAFF, IN WHICH STAFF YOGA CLASSES WERE EXPRESSLY MENTIONED. THE YOGA COMMUNITY IS MOBILIZING FORCES AND APPLYING FOR FUNDING TO PILOT RELEVANT NHS STAFF YOGA COURSES THAT CAN SUPPORT THE SERVICE IN ACHIEVING ITS VISION. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT INTEGRATING YOGA THERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF LOW BACK PAIN (LBP) INTO THE NHS WOULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS AS COMPARED WITH USUAL CARE. THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR HEALTH AND CARE EXCELLENCE (NICE) GUIDELINES ON LBP AND SCIATICA INCLUDE YOGA AS ONE OF THE RECOMMENDED TREATMENTS FOR THESE CONDITIONS. THREE GROUPS OF YOGA TEACHERS, USING DIFFERENT YOGA PRACTICES, HAVE GAINED TRACTION WITH THE NHS FOR THE APPLICATION OF YOGA THERAPY TO LBP. MANY REGIONAL HOSPITALS IN ENGLAND HAVE YOGA CLASSES. THE NHS CHOICES WEBSITE, WHICH CONVEYS INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC REGARDING TREATMENT OPTIONS, HAS A PAGE DEDICATED TO THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF YOGA. SEVERAL INSTITUTIONS OFFER COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING PROGRAMS IN YOGA THERAPY AND YOGA THERAPY IS RECOGNIZED AS AN OFFICIAL PROFESSION. THE YOGA IN HEALTHCARE ALLIANCE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED TO HELP INTEGRATE YOGA THERAPY INTO THE NHS. THIS CONSISTS OF PARLIAMENTARIANS, LEADERS IN THE NHS, YOGA RESEARCHERS, HEALTH PROFESSIONALS, AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM LEADING YOGA ORGANIZATIONS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
18 1927  20 ROLE OF YOGA IN CARDIAC DISEASE AND REHABILITATION. PURPOSE: CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE CONTINUES TO BE THE LEADING CAUSE OF MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY AROUND THE WORLD. YOGA, A COMBINATION OF PHYSICAL POSTURES (ASANA), BREATHING EXERCISES (PRANAYAMA), AND MEDITATION (DHYANA), HAS GAINED INCREASING RECOGNITION AS A FORM OF MIND-BODY EXERCISE. IN THIS NARRATIVE REVIEW, WE INTENDED TO REVIEW THE EMERGING EVIDENCE ASSESSING THE PHYSIOLOGIC AND CLINICAL EFFECTS OF YOGA ON THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM AND THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF YOGA AS A COMPONENT OF COMPREHENSIVE CARDIAC REHABILITATION. METHODS: WE SEARCHED PUBMED, GOOGLE SCHOLAR, EMBASE, AND COCHRANE DATABASES FOR LITERATURE RELATED TO CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS OF YOGA FROM INCEPTION UP UNTIL 2017. RESULTS: YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE FAVORABLE EFFECTS ON SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION, STRESS, THE CARDIAC AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM, AND TRADITIONAL AND EMERGING CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA HAS SHOWN PROMISE AS A USEFUL LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION THAT CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE MANAGEMENT ALGORITHMS. ALTHOUGH MANY INVESTIGATORS HAVE REPORTED THE CLINICAL BENEFITS OF YOGA IN REDUCING CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS, MORBIDITY, AND MORTALITY, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THESE CONCLUSIONS IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED, THEREBY EMPHASIZING THE NEED FOR LARGE, WELL-DESIGNED RANDOMIZED TRIALS THAT MINIMIZE BIAS AND METHODOLOGICAL DRAWBACKS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
19   93  25 A NARRATIVE REVIEW OF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS AS COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES FOR ADDICTION. THIS PAPER REVIEWS THE PHILOSOPHICAL ORIGINS, CURRENT SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE, AND CLINICAL PROMISE OF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS AS COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES FOR ADDICTION. HISTORICALLY, THERE ARE EIGHT ELEMENTS OF YOGA THAT, TOGETHER, COMPRISE ETHICAL PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICES FOR LIVING A MEANINGFUL, PURPOSEFUL, MORAL AND SELF-DISCIPLINED LIFE. TRADITIONAL YOGA PRACTICES, INCLUDING POSTURES AND MEDITATION, DIRECT ATTENTION TOWARD ONE'S HEALTH, WHILE ACKNOWLEDGING THE SPIRITUAL ASPECTS OF ONE'S NATURE. MINDFULNESS DERIVES FROM ANCIENT BUDDHIST PHILOSOPHY, AND MINDFULNESS MEDITATION PRACTICES, SUCH AS GENTLE HATHA YOGA AND MINDFUL BREATHING, ARE INCREASINGLY INTEGRATED INTO SECULAR HEALTH CARE SETTINGS. CURRENT THEORETICAL MODELS SUGGEST THAT THE SKILLS, INSIGHTS, AND SELF-AWARENESS LEARNED THROUGH YOGA AND MINDFULNESS PRACTICE CAN TARGET MULTIPLE PSYCHOLOGICAL, NEURAL, PHYSIOLOGICAL, AND BEHAVIORAL PROCESSES IMPLICATED IN ADDICTION AND RELAPSE. A SMALL BUT GROWING NUMBER OF WELL-DESIGNED CLINICAL TRIALS AND EXPERIMENTAL LABORATORY STUDIES ON SMOKING, ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE, AND ILLICIT SUBSTANCE USE SUPPORT THE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS AND HYPOTHESIZED MECHANISMS OF ACTION UNDERLYING MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR TREATING ADDICTION. BECAUSE VERY FEW STUDIES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED ON THE SPECIFIC ROLE OF YOGA IN TREATING OR PREVENTING ADDICTION, WE PROPOSE A CONCEPTUAL MODEL TO INFORM FUTURE STUDIES ON OUTCOMES AND POSSIBLE MECHANISMS. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS ALSO NEEDED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT TYPES OF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS WORK BEST FOR WHAT TYPES OF ADDICTION, WHAT TYPES OF PATIENTS, AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS. OVERALL, CURRENT FINDINGS INCREASINGLY SUPPORT YOGA AND MINDFULNESS AS PROMISING COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES FOR TREATING AND PREVENTING ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
20  654  27 EEG BASED INTERPRETATION OF HUMAN BRAIN ACTIVITY DURING YOGA AND MEDITATION USING MACHINE LEARNING: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVES: THE PRESENT INVESTIGATION IS TO STUDY THE IMPACT OF YOGA AND MEDITATION ON BRAIN WAVES CONCERNING PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. THERE ARE MAINLY THREE STAGES (STEPS) IN THE BRAIN WAVE CLASSIFICATION:(I) PREPROCESSING, II) FEATURE EXTRACTION, AND III) CLASSIFICATION. THIS WORK PROVIDES A REVIEW OF INTERPRETATION METHODS OF BRAIN SIGNALS (ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM (EEG)) EEG DURING YOGA AND MEDITATION. PAST RESEARCH HAS REVEALED SIGNIFICANT MENTAL AND PHYSICAL ADVANTAGES WITH YOGA AND MEDITATION. METHODS: THE RESEARCH TOPIC REVIEWED FOCUSED ON THE MACHINE LEARNING STRATEGIES APPLIED FOR THE INTERPRETATION OF BRAIN WAVES. IN ADDRESSING THE RESEARCH QUESTIONS HIGHLIGHTED EARLIER IN THE GENERAL INTRODUCTION, WE CONDUCTED A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH OF ARTICLES FROM TARGETED SCIENTIFIC AND JOURNAL ONLINE DATABASES THAT INCLUDED PUBMED, WEB OF SCIENCE, IEEE XPLORE DIGITAL LIBRARY (IEEE), AND ARXIV DATABASES BASED ON THEIR RELEVANCE TO THE RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND DOMAIN TOPIC. THE SURVEY TOPIC IS RELATIVELY NASCENT, AND THEREFORE, THE SCOPE OF THE SEARCH PERIOD WAS LIMITED TO THE 20-YEAR TIMELINE THAT WAS DEEMED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE RESEARCH TOPIC UNDER INVESTIGATION. THE LITERATURE SEARCH WAS BASED ON THE KEYWORDS "EEG", "YOGA*" AND "MEDITATION*". THE KEY PHRASES WERE CONCATENATED USING BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS AND APPLIED TO SEARCH THROUGH THE SELECTED ONLINE DATABASES YIELDING A TOTAL OF 120 ARTICLES. THE ONLINE DATABASES WERE SELECTED BASED ON THE RELEVANCY OF CONTENT WITH THE RESEARCH TITLE, RESEARCH QUESTIONS, AND THE DOMAIN APPLICATION. THE LITERATURE REVIEW SEARCH, PROCESS, AND CLASSIFICATION WERE CAREFULLY CONDUCTED GUIDED BY TWO DEFINED MEASURES; 1.) INCLUSION CRITERIA; AND 2.) EXCLUSION CRITERIA. THESE MEASURES DEFINE THE CRITERIA FOR SEARCHING AND EXTRACTING RELEVANT ARTICLES RELATING TO THE RESEARCH TITLE AND DOMAIN OF INTEREST. RESULTS: OUR LITERATURE SEARCH AND REVIEW INDICATE A BROAD SPECTRUM OF NEURAL MECHANICS UNDER A VARIETY OF MEDITATION STYLES HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED. A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF VARIOUS MENTAL STATES USING ZEN, CHAN, MINDFULNESS, TM, RAJAYOGA, KUNDALINI, YOGA, AND OTHER MEDITATION STYLES HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED BY MEANS OF EEG BANDS. CLASSIFICATION OF MENTAL STATES USING KNN, SVM, RANDOM FOREST, FUZZY LOGIC, NEURAL NETWORKS, CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS HAS BEEN DESCRIBED. SUPERIOR RESEARCH IS STILL REQUIRED TO CLASSIFY THE EEG SIGNATURES CORRESPONDING TO DIFFERENT MENTAL STATES. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA PRACTICE MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT FOR A CLINICAL AND AGING POPULATION. ADVANCED RESEARCH CAN EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF SPECIFIC BRANCHES OF YOGA ON A DESIGNATED CLINICAL GROUPING. YOGA AND MEDITATION INCREASED OVERALL HEALTHY BRAIN ACTIVITY.	2021

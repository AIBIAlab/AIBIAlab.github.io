1  673 89 EFFECT OF A ONE-MONTH YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM ON PERFORMANCE IN A MIRROR-TRACING TASK. THE PERFORMANCE IN A MIRROR STAR TRACING TASK WAS ASSESSED IN TWO GROUPS OF VOLUNTEERS (YOGA AND CONTROL) WITH 26 PEOPLE IN EACH GROUP, AND AGE RANGE BETWEEN 18 AND 45 YEARS. THE STAR TO BE TRACED WAS SIX POINTED AND THE OUTLINE WAS MADE UP OF 60 CIRCLES (4 MM IN DIAMETER). AT THE END OF ONE MONTH THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN TERMS OF AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CIRCLES CROSSED (P<0.001, WILCOXON PAIRED SIGNED RANKS TEST) FOR BOTH HANDS AND A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CIRCLES LEFT OUT FOR THE RIGHT HAND (P<0.05). THE CONTROL GROUP SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN NUMBER OF CIRCLES CROSSED FOR THE LEFT HAND ALONE (P<0.05) AT THE END OF A MONTH ATTRIBUTED TO RE-TEST. THE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT ONE MONTH OF YOGA IMPROVED REVERSAL ABILITY, EYE-HAND CO-ORDINATION, SPEED AND ACCURACY WHICH ARE NECESSARY FOR MIRROR STAR TRACING.	2006	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
2 2894 24 [CLINICAL OBSERVATION OF WARM ACUPUNCTURE COMBINED WITH YOGA POSTURE METHOD IN THE TREATMENT OF PERIARTHRITIS WITH FROZEN PERIOD]. OBJECTIVE: TO OBSERVE THE CLINICAL EFFICACY OF WARM ACUPUNCTURE COMBINED WITH YOGA POSTURE METHOD IN THE TREATMENT OF PERIARTHRITIS WITH FROZEN PERIOD. METHODS: NINETY PATIENTS WITH PERIARTHRITIS WHO MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO A CONTROL GROUP 1, A CONTROL GROUP 2 AND AN OBSERVATION GROUP, 30 CASES IN EACH GROUP. WARM ACUPUNCTURE WAS APPLIED IN THE CONTROL GROUP 1 (JIANZHEN (SI 9), JIANYU (LI 15), JIANLIAO (TE 14), ETC WERE SELECTED), YOGA POSTURE METHOD WAS APPLIED IN THE CONTROL GROUP 2, WARM ACUPUNCTURE COMBINED WITH YOGA POSTURE METHOD WERE GIVEN IN THE OBSERVATION GROUP, THE TREATMENT WAS GIVEN ONCE A DAY, 10 TIMES AS A COURSE WITH 2 DAYS BETWEEN COURSES AND CONTINUOUS FOR 2 COURSES. AFTER 2 COURSES OF TREATMENT, THE SHOULDER JOINT PAIN SCORE AND SHOULDER FUNCTION GRADING WERE USED TO EVALUATE THE CLINICAL EFFICACY, AND THE CLINICAL EFFICACY WAS OBSERVED. RESULTS: 1 IN CIRCLETHE PAIN SCORES OF THE THREE GROUPS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AFTER TREATMENT (ALL P<0.01), AND SCORES IN THE OBSERVATION GROUP WAS BETTER THAN THAT IN THE CONTROL GROUP 1 AND THE CONTROL GROUP 2 (P<0.05, P<0.01). THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CONTROL GROUP 1 AND THE CONTROL GROUP 2 (P>0.05). 2 IN CIRCLEAFTER TREATMENT, THE FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF SHOULDER JOINTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED IN THE THREE GROUPS (ALL P<0.01), AND THE FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF SHOULDER JOINT IN THE OBSERVATION GROUP AND THE CONTROL GROUP 2 WERE BETTER THAN THAT IN THE CONTROL GROUP 1 (P<0.01, P<0.05). THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE OBSERVATION GROUP AND THE CONTROL GROUP 2 (P>0.05). 3 IN CIRCLEAFTER 2 COURSES OF TREATMENT, THE EFFECTIVE RATE OF THE OBSERVATION GROUP WAS 86.7% (26/30), WHICH WAS BETTER THAN 70.0% (21/30) IN THE CONTROL GROUP 1 AND 76.7% (23/30) IN THE CONTROL GROUP 2 (BOTH P<0.05). CONCLUSION: WARM ACUPUNCTURE COMBINED WITH YOGA POSTURE METHOD CAN EFFECTIVELY RELIEVE SHOULDER PAIN AND IMPROVE DYSFUNCTION. THE CLINICAL COMPREHENSIVE EFFECT IS BETTER THAN SIMPLE ACUPUNCTURE AND YOGA POSTURE METHOD.	2019	

3 1755 36 PLASTICITY OF MOTOR CONTROL SYSTEMS DEMONSTRATED BY YOGA TRAINING. THE STATIC MOTOR PERFORMANCE WAS TESTED IN TWO GROUPS WITH 20 SUBJECTS IN EACH (AGE RANGE 17 TO 22 YEARS, AND 5 FEMALES IN EACH GROUP). TESTS WERE CARRIED OUT AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF A 10 DAY PERIOD. THE TEST REQUIRED BEING ABLE TO INSERT AND HOLD A METAL STYLUS WITHIN HOLES OF VARYING SIZES FOR 15 SEC. ACCIDENTAL CONTACTS BETWEEN THE STYLUS AND THE SIDES OF THE HOLES, WERE REGISTERED ON A COUNTER AS ERRORS. DURING THE 10 DAYS ONE GROUP (THE YOGA GROUP) PRACTISED ASANAS (PHYSICAL POSTURES), PRANAYAMA (VOLUNTARY REGULATION OF BREATHING), MEDITATION, DEVOTIONAL SESSIONS, AND TRATAKAS (VISUAL FOCUSSING EXERCISES). THE CONTROL GROUP FOLLOWED THEIR USUAL ROUTINE. AT THE END OF 10 DAYS THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN NUMBER OF ERRORS (WILCOXON PAIRED SIGNED RANKS TEST), WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT CHANGE. OUR EARLIER STUDY SHOWED A SIMILAR IMPROVEMENT IN CHILDREN (9-13 YEARS). IT WAS INTERESTING TO NOTE THE SAME DEGREE OF PLASTICITY IN MOTOR CONTROL SYSTEMS IN YOUNG ADULTS. THE IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION PROGRAMMES HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED.	1994	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
4  832 31 EFFECT OF YOGA ON MUSCULOSKELETAL DISCOMFORT AND MOTOR FUNCTIONS IN PROFESSIONAL COMPUTER USERS. THE SELF-RATED MUSCULOSKELETAL DISCOMFORT, HAND GRIP STRENGTH, TAPPING SPEED, AND LOW BACK AND HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY (BASED ON A SIT AND REACH TASK) WERE ASSESSED IN 291 PROFESSIONAL COMPUTER USERS. THEY WERE THEN RANDOMIZED AS YOGA (YG; N=146) AND WAIT-LIST CONTROL (WL; N=145) GROUPS. FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENTS FOR BOTH GROUPS WERE AFTER 60 DAYS DURING WHICH THE YG GROUP PRACTICED YOGA FOR 60 MINUTES DAILY, FOR 5 DAYS IN A WEEK. THE WL GROUP SPENT THE SAME TIME IN THEIR USUAL RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES. AT THE END OF 60 DAYS, THE YG GROUP (N=62) SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE FREQUENCY, INTENSITY AND DEGREE OF INTERFERENCE DUE TO MUSCULOSKELETAL DISCOMFORT, AN INCREASE IN BILATERAL HAND GRIP STRENGTH, THE RIGHT HAND TAPPING SPEED, AND LOW BACK AND HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY (REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA AND POST HOC ANALYSIS WITH BONFERRONI ADJUSTMENT). IN CONTRAST, THE WL GROUP (N=56) SHOWED AN INCREASE IN MUSCULOSKELETAL DISCOMFORT AND A DECREASE IN LEFT HAND TAPPING SPEED. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA PRACTICE IS A USEFUL ADDITION TO THE ROUTINE OF PROFESSIONAL COMPUTER USERS.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
5 2814 25 YOGA TRAINING AND MOTOR SPEED BASED ON A FINGER TAPPING TASK. A FINGER TAPPING TASK WAS USED TO ASSESS MOTOR SPEED (MS) OF BOTH HANDS IN 53 ADULTS AND 152 CHILDREN BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA TRAINING AND IN 38 ADULTS OF A NON-YOGA (CONTROL) GROUP. ALL SUBJECTS WERE RIGHT HAND DOMINANT. THE 30-SECOND TAPPING SPEED (TS) TEST WAS CONSIDERED AS THREE TIME INTERVALS, I.E. 0-10 SECOND (TS1), 10-20 SECONDS (TS2) AND 20-30 SECONDS (TS3). THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT (STUDENT'S T-TEST) INCREASE IN ALL THREE TS VALUES FOLLOWING 10 DAYS OF YOGA IN CHILDREN AND 30 DAYS OF YOGA IN ADULTS. HOWEVER FOR BOTH GROUPS AT BASELINE AND FINAL ASSESSMENTS, TS2 AND TS3 WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN TS1. HENCE THE TS WAS INCREASED AFTER YOGA TRAINING DURING THE FIRST 10-SECONDS OF THE TEST BUT NOT DURING THE NEXT 20 SECONDS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST AN INCREASE IN MOTOR SPEED FOR REPETITIVE FINGER MOVEMENTS FOLLOWING YOGA TRAINING, BUT NOT IN STRENGTH OR ENDURANCE, AS THE INCREASE WAS NOT SUSTAINED OVER 30 SEC.	1999	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
6  277 23 ADDITIONAL PRACTICE OF YOGA BREATHING WITH INTERMITTENT BREATH HOLDING ENHANCES PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS IN YOGA PRACTITIONERS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: THE PRACTICE OF YOGA IS ASSOCIATED WITH ENHANCED PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING. THE CURRENT STUDY ASSESSED THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE DURATION OF YOGA PRACTICE WITH STATE MINDFULNESS, MIND-WANDERING AND STATE ANXIETY. ALSO, WE EXAMINED IF AN ADDITIONAL 20 MIN OF YOGA BREATHING WITH INTERMITTENT BREATH HOLDING (EXPERIMENTAL GROUP) FOR 8 WEEKS WOULD AFFECT THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIABLES MORE THAN REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE (CONTROL GROUP) ALONE. METHODS: ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN SUBJECTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EXPERIMENTAL (N = 60) AND CONTROL (N = 56) GROUPS. STATE MINDFULNESS ATTENTION AWARENESS SCALE (SMAAS), MIND-WANDERING QUESTIONNAIRE (MWQ) AND STATE ANXIETY INVENTORY WERE ADMINISTERED AT BASELINE AND AT THE END OF 8 WEEKS. RESULTS: BASELINE ASSESSMENT REVEALED A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN DURATION OF YOGA PRACTICE WITH SMAAS SCORES AND NEGATIVE CORRELATION WITH MWQ AND STATE ANXIETY SCORES. AT THE END OF 8 WEEKS, BOTH GROUPS DEMONSTRATED ENHANCED PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS, BUT THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP RECEIVING ADDITIONAL YOGA BREATHING PERFORMED BETTER THAN THE GROUP PRACTICING YOGA ALONE. CONCLUSION: AN ADDITIONAL PRACTICE OF YOGA BREATHING WITH INTERMITTENT BREATH HOLDING WAS FOUND TO ENHANCE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS IN YOUNG ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
7 1351 27 IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF A YOGA BREATHING PRACTICE ON ATTENTION AND ANXIETY IN PRE-TEEN CHILDREN. PRE-TEEN CHILDREN FACE STRESSORS RELATED TO THEIR TRANSITION FROM CHILDHOOD TO ADOLESCENCE, WITH A SIMULTANEOUS INCREASE IN ACADEMIC PRESSURE. THE PRESENT STUDY COMPARED THE IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF 18 MIN OF (I) HIGH FREQUENCY YOGA BREATHING WITH (II) YOGA-BASED BREATH AWARENESS AND (III) SITTING QUIETLY, ON (A) ATTENTION AND (B) ANXIETY, IN 61 PRE-TEEN CHILDREN (AGED BETWEEN 11 AND 12 YEARS; 25 GIRLS). ATTENTION WAS ASSESSED USING A SIX LETTER CANCELLATION TASK AND SPIELBERGER'S STATE TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY STAI-S WAS USED TO MEASURE ANXIETY BEFORE AND AFTER THE THREE PRACTICES, PRACTICED ON SEPARATE DAYS. REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA, FOLLOWED BY BONFERRONI ADJUSTED POST-HOC ANALYSES SHOWED AN INCREASE IN TOTAL ATTEMPTS AND NET SCORES AFTER HIGH FREQUENCY YOGA BREATHING (P < 0.05), WHILE WRONG ATTEMPTS INCREASED AFTER YOGA BASED BREATH AWARENESS (P < 0.05). ANXIETY DECREASED COMPARABLY AFTER ALL THREE INTERVENTIONS. THE 25 GIRLS IN THE GROUP HAD THE SAME TREND OF RESULTS AS THE WHOLE GROUP WITH RESPECT TO THE ATTENTION-BASED CANCELLATION TASK, WHILE BOYS SHOWED NO, HOW SINCE CHANGE. FOR BOTH GIRLS AND BOYS, ANXIETY DECREASED AFTER ALL THREE 18MIN INTERVENTIONS. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT HIGH FREQUENCY YOGA BREATHING COULD BE A SHORT, USEFUL SCHOOL BASED PRACTICE TO IMPROVE ATTENTION AND REDUCE ANXIETY.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
8 1422 30 IMPROVEMENT IN HAND GRIP STRENGTH IN NORMAL VOLUNTEERS AND RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS PATIENTS FOLLOWING YOGA TRAINING. THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED AT ASSESSING THE EFFECTS OF A SET OF YOGA PRACTICES ON NORMAL ADULTS (N = 37), CHILDREN (N = 86), AND PATIENTS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (N = 20). AN EQUAL NUMBER OF NORMAL ADULTS, CHILDREN, AND PATIENTS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS WHO DID NOT PRACTICE YOGA WERE STUDIED UNDER EACH CATEGORY, FORMING RESPECTIVE CONTROL GROUPS. YOGA AND CONTROL GROUP SUBJECTS WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND AFTER VARYING INTERVALS, AS FOLLOWS, ADULTS AFTER 30 DAYS, CHILDREN AFTER 10 DAYS AND PATIENTS AFTER 15 DAYS, BASED ON THE DURATION OF THE YOGA PROGRAM, WHICH THEY ATTENDED, WHICH WAS ALREADY FIXED. HAND GRIP STRENGTH OF BOTH HANDS, MEASURED WITH A GRIP DYNAMOMETER, INCREASED IN NORMAL ADULTS AND CHILDREN, AND IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS PATIENTS, FOLLOWING YOGA, BUT NOT IN THE CORRESPONDING CONTROL GROUPS, SHOWING NO RE-TEST EFFECT. ADULT FEMALE VOLUNTEERS AND PATIENTS SHOWED A GREATER PERCENTAGE IMPROVEMENT THAN CORRESPONDING ADULT MALES. THIS GENDER-BASED DIFFERENCE WAS NOT OBSERVED IN CHILDREN. HENCE YOGA PRACTICE IMPROVES HAND GRIP STRENGTH IN NORMAL PERSONS AND IN PATIENTS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, THOUGH THE MAGNITUDE OF IMPROVEMENT VARIES WITH FACTORS SUCH AS GENDER AND AGE.	2001	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
9 1762 31 POST TRAUMATIC STRESS SYMPTOMS AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY IN BIHAR FLOOD SURVIVORS FOLLOWING YOGA: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. BACKGROUND: AN EARLIER STUDY SHOWED THAT A WEEK OF YOGA PRACTICE WAS USEFUL IN STRESS MANAGEMENT AFTER A NATURAL CALAMITY. DUE TO HEAVY RAIN AND A RIFT ON THE BANKS OF THE KOSI RIVER, IN THE STATE OF BIHAR IN NORTH INDIA, THERE WERE FLOODS WITH LOSS OF LIFE AND PROPERTY. A WEEK OF YOGA PRACTICE WAS GIVEN TO THE SURVIVORS A MONTH AFTER THE EVENT AND THE EFFECT WAS ASSESSED. METHODS: TWENTY-TWO VOLUNTEERS (GROUP AVERAGE AGE +/- S.D, 31.5 +/- 7.5 YEARS; ALL OF THEM WERE MALES) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO TWO GROUPS, YOGA AND A NON-YOGA WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP. THE YOGA GROUP PRACTICED YOGA FOR AN HOUR DAILY WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP CONTINUED WITH THEIR ROUTINE ACTIVITIES. BOTH GROUPS' HEART RATE VARIABILITY, BREATH RATE, AND FOUR SYMPTOMS OF EMOTIONAL DISTRESS USING VISUAL ANALOG SCALES, WERE ASSESSED ON THE FIRST AND EIGHTH DAY OF THE PROGRAM. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN SADNESS IN THE YOGA GROUP (P < 0.05, PAIRED T-TEST, POST DATA COMPARED TO PRE) AND AN INCREASE IN ANXIETY IN THE CONTROL GROUP (P < 0.05, PAIRED T-TEST, POST DATA COMPARED TO PRE). CONCLUSIONS: A WEEK OF YOGA CAN REDUCE FEELINGS OF SADNESS AND POSSIBLY PREVENT AN INCREASE IN ANXIETY IN FLOOD SURVIVORS A MONTH AFTER THE CALAMITY.

10 1969 33 SHORT TERM EFFECT OF YOGA ASANA - AN ADJUNCT THERAPY TO CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT IN FROZEN SHOULDER. BACKGROUND: THE AVAILABLE TREATMENTS FOR FROZEN SHOULDER YIELD VARIABLE RESULTS. PHYSICAL THERAPY AND ANALGESICS ARE CONSIDERED AS THE FIRST-LINE TREATMENT FOR THIS DISORDER, BUT THE EFFECTS ARE NOT UNIFORM. THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE MAY HAVE A ROLE IN ITS MANAGEMENT. OBJECTIVE(S): THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO EXAMINE THE SHORT-TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH FROZEN SHOULDER OF MILD TO MODERATE SEVERITY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED ON PATIENTS WITH FROZEN SHOULDER BETWEEN 30 AND 60 YEARS OF AGE. THEY WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: YOGA (Y) AND CONTROL (NY). A SET OF ASANA EXERCISES CALLED "STANDING GROUP OF ASANA" WAS PRACTICED BY THE YOGA GROUP IN ADDITION TO THE CONVENTIONAL THERAPY AS RECEIVED BY THE CONTROL GROUP. THE PATIENTS WERE REVIEWED AT 1, 2 AND 4 WEEKS. THE PAIN AND FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT WERE DONE AT BASELINE AND AT EACH REVIEW USING THE SHOULDER PAIN AND DISABILITY INDEX (SPADI). RESULTS: THERE WERE 16 MALE AND 20 FEMALE PARTICIPANTS IN THE Y GROUP, AND 15 MALES AND 21 FEMALES IN THE NY GROUP. THERE WAS NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN AGE, SEX, AND PRE-TREATMENT SPADI SCORE BETWEEN THE GROUPS. AT THE END OF THE FOUR WEEKS, THE SPADI PAIN SCORES IN THE Y AND NY GROUP WERE 20.47 AND 20.14, RESPECTIVELY (P = 0.666). THE SPADI DISABILITY SCORES IN THE Y AND NY GROUP WERE 20.4 AND 19.7, RESPECTIVELY (P = 0.599). OVERALL SPADI SCORES WERE 40.67 AND 40.03 IN THE Y AND NY GROUP, RESPECTIVELY (P = 0.736). BOTH GROUPS HAD A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SPADI PAIN AND DISABILITY SCORES. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GROUPS IN TERMS OF SPADI SCORES. CONCLUSION: THE EFFECT OF THE STANDING GROUP OF ASANA HAS NO ADDED ADVANTAGE RELATIVE TO STANDARD FROZEN SHOULDER TREATMENT WHEN PRACTICED FOR ONE MONTH.	2020

12 1637 23 MODULATION OF CARDIAC AUTONOMIC BALANCE WITH ADJUVANT YOGA THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH REFRACTORY EPILEPSY. THE PRACTICE OF YOGA REGULATES BODY PHYSIOLOGY THROUGH CONTROL OF POSTURE, BREATHING, AND MEDITATION. EFFECTS OF YOGA ON AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS OF PATIENTS WITH REFRACTORY EPILEPSY, AS QUANTIFIED BY STANDARDIZED AUTONOMIC FUNCTION TESTS (AFTS), WERE DETERMINED. THE YOGA GROUP (N=18) RECEIVED SUPERVISED TRAINING IN YOGA, AND THE EXERCISE GROUP (N=16) PRACTICED SIMPLE ROUTINE EXERCISES. AFTS WERE REPEATED AFTER 10 WEEKS OF DAILY SESSIONS. DATA WERE COMPARED WITH THOSE OF HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS (N=142). THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PARASYMPATHETIC PARAMETERS AND A DECREASE IN SEIZURE FREQUENCY SCORES. THERE WAS NO IMPROVEMENT IN BLOOD PRESSURE PARAMETERS IN EITHER GROUP. TWO PATIENTS IN THE YOGA GROUP ACHIEVED NORMAL AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS AT THE END OF 10 WEEKS OF THERAPY, WHEREAS THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN THE EXERCISE GROUP. THE DATA SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY HAVE A ROLE AS AN ADJUVANT THERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION IN PATIENTS WITH REFRACTORY EPILEPSY.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
13  305 26 AN EVALUATION OF PULMONARY PARAMETERS IN TWO GROUPS OF SUBJECTS DURING YOGA PRACTICE. THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE HOW FAR THE SHORT TERM PRACTICE OF YOGA (30 AND 60 DAYS) FOR AN HOUR DAILY CAN IMPROVE THE RESPIRATORY FUNCTION. MALE SUBJECTS (N=50, AGE 30-50 YEARS) WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED. RESPIRATORY PARAMETERS (FVC, FEV1, PEFR, FEF(25-75%) AND MVV) WERE DETERMINED BY USING A MULTIFUNCTIONAL COMPUTERIZED SPIROMETER. YOGA (POSTURE AND PRANAYAMAS) PRACTICE FOR A MONTH PRODUCED NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PULMONARY PARAMETERS. NEVERTHELESS, WHEN THE SUBJECTS CONTINUED IT FOR NEXT 30 DAYS, I.E., AFTER 60 DAYS SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE NOTED IN FVC (P<0.001), FEV, (P<0.01) AND PEFR (P<0.05). THE RESULT ALSO REVEALED THAT AMONGST THEM 30 DAYS YOGA TRAINING RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN FVC IN ELDER GROUP OF PEOPLE (AGE 41-50 YRS) WHERE AS IN YOUNGER GROUP (AGE 30-40 YRS) THE CHANGES WERE NOT SO PROMINENT. RESULT INDICATED THAT SHORT TERM (30 DAYS) YOGA PRACTICE QUICKLY IMPROVES RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS IN RELATIVELY ELDER PEOPLE (AGE 41-50 YRS), WHEN MANY OF THEM IN OUR TROPICAL COUNTRY SUFFER FROM PRIMARY LEVEL OF RESPIRATORY PROBLEM.

BACKGROUND: PHYSIOLOGICAL BENEFITS OF YOGA ON VOLUNTEERS OF A PARTICULAR AGE GROUP ARE AVAILABLE. HOWEVER, REPORTS ON EFFICACY OF A SPECIFIC YOGA PACKAGE ON THE POPULACE OF DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS FROM SIMILAR OCCUPATIONAL BACKGROUND IS STILL VERY LIMITED. THEREFORE, THE PRESENT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO APPRAISE THE EFFECT OF A SPECIFIC HATHA YOGA PACKAGE ON ANTHROPOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS, FLEXIBILITY AND MUSCULAR STRENGTH OF HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS OF DIFFERENT AGE GROUPS FROM SIMILAR OCCUPATIONAL TRADE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 71 PARTICIPANTS (GROUP ALL) FROM INDIAN AIR FORCE GROUND PERSONNEL VOLUNTEERED AND AGE WISE DIVIDED INTO 3 GROUPS - (I) GROUP I (GR. - I) (N1 = 27, 20-29 YEARS), (II) GROUP II (GR. - II) (N2 = 21, 30-39 YEARS) AND (III) GROUP III (GR. - III) (N3 = 23, 40-49 YEARS). ALL THE PARTICIPANTS UNDERGONE SELECTED HATHA YOGA TRAINING FOR 1 H DAILY FOR A PERIOD OF 12 WEEKS. PARAMETERS WERE RECORDED BEFORE AND AFTER THE TRAINING. PRE AND POST TRAINING DIFFERENCES WERE ASSESSED BY STUDENT'S T-TEST. RESULTS: BODY WEIGHT (ALL, GR. - II AND GR. - III [ALL P < 0.05]), BODY MASS INDEX (GR. - II AND GR. - III [BOTH P < 0.01]) AND FAT% (GR. - II AND III [BOTH P < 0.05]) WERE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. NECK CIRCUMFERENCE WAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN GR. - I (P < 0.05) BUT DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN GR. - III (P < 0.05). CHEST CIRCUMFERENCE (ALL (P < 0.001), IN GR. - I AND II [BOTH P < 0.05]), GRIP STRENGTH (ALL [LEFT: P < 0.01 AND RIGHT: P < 0.05], IN GR. - I [LEFT: P < 0.05 AND RIGHT: P < 0.01], IN GR. - II [RIGHT: P < 0.05] AND IN GR. - III [LEFT: P < 0.05 AND RIGHT: P < 0.01]), BACK LEG STRENGTH (GROUP WISE P < 0.001, P < 0.05, P < 0.01 AND P < 0.05 RESPECTIVELY) AND FLEXIBILITY (ALL P < 0.001) WERE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION: HATHA YOGA CAN IMPROVE ANTHROPOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS, MUSCULAR STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY AMONG VOLUNTEERS OF DIFFERENT AGE GROUP AND CAN ALSO BE HELPFUL IN PREVENTING AND ATTENUATING AGE RELATED DETERIORATION OF THESE PARAMETERS.	2015	
                                   
15 1559 21 LONG-TERM VIHANGAM YOGA MEDITATION AND SCORES ON TESTS OF ATTENTION. ALTHOUGH THE LITERATURE INDICATES THAT MEDITATION HAS BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON SEVERAL ASPECTS OF HUMAN FUNCTIONING, FEW STUDIES HAVE SPECIFICALLY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF MEDITATION ON VARIOUS DOMAINS OF ATTENTION. THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO EXAMINE THE DIFFERENCES IN VARIOUS DOMAINS OF ATTENTION BETWEEN LONG-TERM CONCENTRATIVE MEDITATORS VERSUS MATCHED CONTROLS. 15 PRACTITIONERS OF VIHANGAM YOGA (> 10 YR. EXPERIENCE) WERE ENROLLED IN THE STUDY. CONTROLS MATCHED ON AGE, SEX, AND YEARS OF EDUCATION WERE RECRUITED. BOTH GROUPS WERE ADMINISTERED THE STROOP, TRAIL-MAKING, AND DIGIT SYMBOL SUBSTITUTION TESTS AS WELL AS THE DIGIT FORWARD AND DIGIT BACKWARD TESTS. THE GROUP OF VIHANGAM YOGIS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER MEAN PERFORMANCE ON ALL TESTS OF ATTENTION. LONG-TERM VIHANGAM YOGA MEDITATION IMPROVES ATTENTION SPAN, PROCESSING SPEED, ATTENTION ALTERNATION ABILITY, AND PERFORMANCE IN INTERFERENCE TESTS.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
16  678 21 EFFECT OF A YOGA PRACTICE SESSION AND A YOGA THEORY SESSION ON STATE ANXIETY. YOGA TECHNIQUES PRACTICED FOR VARYING DURATIONS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE STATE ANXIETY. IN THIS STUDY, THERE WERE 300 NAIVE-TO-YOGA PERSONS OF BOTH SEXES WHO WERE ATTENDING A YOGA THERAPY CENTER IN NORTH INDIA FOR STRESS RELIEF AS DAY VISITORS AND WERE NOT RESIDING AT THE CENTER. THEY WERE ASSIGNED TO TWO GROUPS, YOGA PRACTICE AND YOGA THEORY, AND THEIR STATE ANXIETY WAS ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER A 2-HR. YOGA SESSION. A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SCORES ON STATE ANXIETY WAS FOUND IN THE YOGA PRACTICE GROUP (14.7% DECREASE), AS WELL AS IN THE YOGA THEORY GROUP (3.4% DECREASE). THE DIFFERENCE IN SCORES FOLLOWING THE SESSIONS WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. HENCE, YOGA PRACTICE AS WELL AS LEARNING ABOUT THEORETICAL ASPECTS OF YOGA APPEAR TO REDUCE STATE ANXIETY, WITH A GREATER REDUCTION FOLLOWING YOGA PRACTICE.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
17   48 33 A COMBINATION OF FOCUSING AND DEFOCUSING THROUGH YOGA REDUCES OPTICAL ILLUSION MORE THAN FOCUSING ALONE. THE DEGREE OF OPTICAL ILLUSION WAS ASSESSED USING STANDARD MULLER-LYER LINES IN TWO GROUPS (YOGA AND CONTROL) OF THIRTY SUBJECTS EACH. ALL SUBJECTS WERE BETWEEN EIGHTEEN AND FORTY TWO YEARS OF AGE. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE READING AT WHICH THE LINES WERE ACTUALLY EQUAL AND THE READING AT WHICH THE SUBJECT FELT THEM TO BE EQUAL, WAS NOTED AS THE DEGREE OF ILLUSION ("DI"). EACH SUBJECT WAS ASSESSED AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF A MONTH. DURING THE MONTH THE YOGA GROUP RECEIVED TRAINING IN YOGA, WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP CARRIED ON WITH THEIR USUAL ROUTINE. AT THE END OF THE MONTH THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT (TWO FACTOR ANOVA, TUKEY TEST, P < .001) DECREASE IN THE "DI" (86%), WHEREAS THE CONTROL GROUP SHOWED NO CHANGE. THE IMPROVEMENT FOLLOWING YOGA COULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE COMBINATION OF FOCUSING AND DEFOCUSING INVOLVED IN YOGA PRACTICE, AS THESE FACTORS ARE KNOWN TO INFLUENCE THE "DI". PREVIOUS RESULTS WHICH MENTIONED A 79% DECREASE IN "DI" WITH FOCUSING ALONE, PROVIDED A COMPARISON.	1997

BACKGROUND: MENTAL HEALTH-CARE STUDENTS EXPERIENCE STRESS AND BURNOUT DURING THEIR TRAINING PERIOD. YOGA HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE HELPFUL IN IMPROVING ONE'S MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. AIM: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO DEVELOP AND TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF A BRIEF YOGA MODULE FOR POSTGRADUATE MENTAL HEALTH-CARE STUDENTS. METHODS: AMIXED METHOD DESIGN WAS USED. PHASE 1 INVOLVED DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF THE YOGA MODULE USING THE QUALITATIVE EXPLORATORY METHOD. PHASE II TESTED THE FEASIBILITY OF THE MODULE ON A SAMPLE OF 28 FIRST-YEAR POSTGRADUATE STUDENTS. THESE STUDENTS PARTICIPATED IN A 15-DAY (30 MIN/DAY) BRIEF YOGA MODULE FOR IMPROVING THEIR WELL-BEING AND COGNITION (MIRROR NEURON ACTIVATION [MNA] AND TOWER OF LONDON TASK AS ASSESSED ON DAY 0, DAY 15 (2 WEEKS), AND DAY 30 (4 WEEKS). QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK OF THE STUDENT VOLUNTEERS WAS ALSO RECORDED. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE WELL-BEING SCORES WAS OBSERVED IN THE STUDENTS WHO ADHERED TO THE YOGA PRACTICE AFTER 2 WEEKS AND 4 WEEKS. FUNCTIONAL NEAR INFRA-RED SPECTROSCOPY (FNIRS) DATA INDICATED THAT ADHERENTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT ACTIVATION OF LEFT SOMATOSENSORY REGION OF THE BRAIN AND DEACTIVATION IN THE RIGHT PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY REGION DURING THE STATIC AND ACTIVE PHASE OF THE MNA TASK, RESPECTIVELY. ADHERENT GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN REACTION TIME DURING "ZERO-MOVES" TASKS OF TOWER OF LONDON. THE QUALITATIVE THEMATIC ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE MODULE HELPED IMPROVE THE WELL-BEING AND MENTAL HEALTH OF THE STUDENTS. CONCLUSION: THE YOGA PROGRAM WAS FOUND TO HAVE HIGH NEED AND MEDIUM TO HIGH FEASIBILITY. A SYSTEMIC INTEGRATION OF STUDENT WELL-BEING-ORIENTED INTERVENTIONS INCLUDING YOGA IN THE CURRICULUM OF POSTGRADUATE MENTAL HEALTH-CARE COURSES IS ADVOCATED.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
19 1442 22 INCREASED MENTAL WELL-BEING AND REDUCED STATE ANXIETY IN TEACHERS AFTER PARTICIPATION IN A RESIDENTIAL YOGA PROGRAM. BACKGROUND REDUCING STRESS IN THE WORKPLACE IMPROVES MENTAL HEALTH. TEACHING IS OF SOCIAL IMPORTANCE, BUT IT MAY RECEIVE INADEQUATE RECOGNITION AND REWARDS. THE PRESENT STUDY COMPARED MENTAL WELL-BEING AND STATE ANXIETY IN PRIMARY SCHOOL TEACHERS WHO PRACTICED 15 DAYS OF YOGA IN A RESIDENTIAL SETTING WITH THOSE WHO CONTINUED THEIR USUAL ROUTINE. MATERIAL AND METHODS WE ENROLLED 236 PRIMARY SCHOOL TEACHERS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY. WE ASSIGNED 118 PRIMARY SCHOOL TEACHERS (GROUP MEAN +/-S.D., AGE 41.5+/-6.0 YEARS, 74 FEMALES) TO THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP; THEY UNDERWENT 15 DAYS OF YOGA TRAINING FOR 6 HOURS/DAY) IN A RESIDENTIAL YOGA CENTER. THE NON-YOGA CONTROL GROUP (GROUP MEAN +/-S.D., AGE 42.3+/-6.0 YEARS, 79 FEMALES) CONSISTED OF 118 TEACHERS WHO CONTINUED WITH THEIR NORMAL TEACHING ROUTINE. RESULTS AFTER 15 DAYS IN THE RESIDENTIAL YOGA PROGRAM, THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN OVERALL MENTAL WELL-BEING (P<.001) AND LOWER STATE ANXIETY (P<.01) (REPEATED-MEASURES ANOVA, FOLLOWED BY POST HOC MULTIPLE COMPARISON TESTS). AT BASELINE, THE NON-YOGA CONTROL GROUP HAD HIGHER LEVELS OF STATE ANXIETY, PRESUMABLY RELATED TO THEIR REMAINING IN THE WORKPLACE. CONCLUSIONS THE STUDY WAS A 15-DAY, COMPARATIVE, CONTROLLED TRIAL. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT AFTER 15 DAYS OF PARTICIPATION IN THE RESIDENTIAL YOGA PROGRAM, PRIMARY SCHOOL TEACHERS INCREASED ALL ASPECTS OF MENTAL WELL-BEING AND HAD REDUCED STATE ANXIETY.	2018

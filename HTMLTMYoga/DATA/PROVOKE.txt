1  787 118 EFFECT OF YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES (PRANAYAMA) ON AIRWAY REACTIVITY IN SUBJECTS WITH ASTHMA. THE EFFECTS OF TWO PRANAYAMA YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES ON AIRWAY REACTIVITY, AIRWAY CALIBRE, SYMPTOM SCORES, AND MEDICATION USE IN PATIENTS WITH MILD ASTHMA WERE ASSESSED IN A RANDOMISED, DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, CROSSOVER TRIAL. AFTER BASELINE ASSESSMENT OVER 1 WEEK, 18 PATIENTS WITH MILD ASTHMA PRACTISED SLOW DEEP BREATHING FOR 15 MIN TWICE A DAY FOR TWO CONSECUTIVE 2-WEEK PERIODS. DURING THE ACTIVE PERIOD, SUBJECTS WERE ASKED TO BREATHE THROUGH A PINK CITY LUNG (PCL) EXERCISER--A DEVICE WHICH IMPOSES SLOWING OF BREATHING AND A 1:2 INSPIRATION:EXPIRATION DURATION RATIO EQUIVALENT TO PRANAYAMA BREATHING METHODS; DURING THE CONTROL PERIOD, SUBJECTS BREATHED THROUGH A MATCHED PLACEBO DEVICE. MEAN FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1 S (FEV1), PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE, SYMPTOM SCORE, AND INHALER USE OVER THE LAST 3 DAYS OF EACH TREATMENT PERIOD WERE ASSESSED IN COMPARISON WITH THE BASELINE ASSESSMENT PERIOD; ALL IMPROVED MORE WITH THE PCL EXERCISER THAN WITH THE PLACEBO DEVICE, BUT THE DIFFERENCES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT. THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE DOSE OF HISTAMINE NEEDED TO PROVOKE A 20% REDUCTION IN FEV1 (PD20) DURING PRANAYAMA BREATHING BUT NOT WITH THE PLACEBO DEVICE. THE USEFULNESS OF CONTROLLED VENTILATION EXERCISES IN THE CONTROL OF ASTHMA SHOULD BE FURTHER INVESTIGATED.	1990	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
2 2545  33 YOGA FOR ASTHMA? A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AS A TREATMENT OPTION FOR ASTHMA. METHOD: SEVEN DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FROM THEIR INCEPTION TO OCTOBER 2010. RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS (RCTS) AND NON-RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS (NRCTS) WERE CONSIDERED, IF THEY INVESTIGATED ANY TYPE OF YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH ASTHMA. THE SELECTION OF STUDIES, DATA EXTRACTION, AND VALIDATION WERE PERFORMED INDEPENDENTLY BY TWO REVIEWERS. RESULTS: SIX RCTS AND ONE NRCT MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. THEIR METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY WAS MOSTLY POOR. THREE RCTS AND ONE NRCT SUGGESTED THAT YOGA LEADS TO A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER REDUCTION IN SPIROMETRIC MEASURES, AIRWAY HYPERRESPONSIVITY, DOSE OF HISTAMINE NEEDED TO PROVOKE A 20% REDUCTION IN FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN THE FIRST SECOND, WEEKLY NUMBER OF ASTHMA ATTACKS, AND NEED FOR DRUG TREATMENT. THREE RCTS SHOWED NO POSITIVE EFFECTS COMPARED TO VARIOUS CONTROL INTERVENTIONS. CONCLUSIONS: THE BELIEF THAT YOGA ALLEVIATES ASTHMA IS NOT SUPPORTED BY SOUND EVIDENCE. FURTHER, MORE RIGOROUS TRIALS ARE WARRANTED.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
3 1123  25 EFFICACY OF NATUROPATHY AND YOGA IN BRONCHIAL ASTHMA. THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF A ONE MONTH IN-PATIENT NATUROPATHY AND YOGA PROGRAMME FOR PATIENTS WITH ASTHMA. RETROSPECTIVE DATA OF 159 BRONCHIAL ASTHMA PATIENTS, UNDERGOING THE NATUROPATHY AND YOGA PROGRAMME, WAS ANALYZED FOR FORCED VITAL CAPACITY, FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME AT THE END OF 1 SECOND, MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE ON ADMISSION, 11TH DAY, ON DISCHARGE AND ONCE IN THREE MONTHS FOR THREE YEARS. THE PAIRED SAMPLE T TEST RESULTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE FORCED VITAL CAPACITY AND FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME FROM THE DATE OF ADMISSION UP TO 6TH MONTH (P < 0.0035) POST BONFERRONI CORRECTION. MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FROM ADMISSION TILL THE DATE OF DISCHARGE (P < 0.0035) AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FROM ADMISSION TILL THE 36TH MONTH OF FOLLOW-UP (P < 0.0035), POST BONFERRONI CORRECTION. THIS VALIDATED THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF COMBINING NATUROPATHY AND YOGA FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
4 2005  31 STUDY OF PULMONARY AND AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS OF ASTHMA PATIENTS AFTER YOGA TRAINING. "THE CONCEPT OF YOGA IS HELPFUL FOR THE TREATMENT OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA", HAS CREATED A GREAT INTEREST IN THE MEDICAL RESEARCH FIELD. IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS AND PULMONARY FUNCTIONS ARE IMPROVED IN ASTHMA PATIENTS AFTER SHORT TERM YOGA TRAINING, A STUDY WAS CONDUCTED WITH NINE DIAGNOSED BRONCHIAL ASTHMA PATIENTS. YOGA TRAINING WAS GIVEN FOR SEVEN DAYS IN A CAMP IN ADHYATMA SADHNA KENDRA, NEW DELHI. THE AUTONOMIC FUNCTION TESTS TO MEASURE THE PARASYMPATHETIC REACTIVITY (DEEP BREATHING TEST, VALSALVA MANOUEVER), SYMPATHETIC REACTIVITY (HAND GRIP TEST, COLD PRESSURE TEST), AND PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS FVC, FEV1, PEFR, PIF, BHT AND CE WERE RECORDED BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA TRAINING. THE RESTING HEART RATE AFTER YOGA TRAINING (P < 0.05) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED (89.55 +/- 18.46/MIN TO 76.22 +/- 16.44/MIN). THE SYMPATHETIC REACTIVITY WAS REDUCED FOLLOWING YOGA TRAINING AS INDICATED BY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.01) REDUCTION IN DBP AFTER HGT. THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN PARASYMPATHETIC REACTIVITY. THE FVC, FEV1, PEFR DID NOT SHOW ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. THE PIF (P < 0.01), BHT (P < 0.01) AND CE (P < 0.01) SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. THE RESULTS CLOSELY INDICATED THE REDUCTION IN SYMPATHETIC REACTIVITY AND IMPROVEMENT IN THE PULMONARY VENTILATION BY WAY OF RELAXATION OF VOLUNTARY INSPIRATORY AND EXPIRATORY MUSCLES. THE "COMPREHENSIVE YOGIC LIFE STYLE CHANGE PROGRAMME FOR PATIENTS OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA" HAVE SHOWN SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT EVEN WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD.	1996	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
5  887  22 EFFECT OF YOGA TYPE BREATHING ON HEART RATE AND CARDIAC AXIS OF NORMAL SUBJECTS. EFFECT OF INSPIRATORY AND EXPIRATORY PHASES OF NORMAL QUIET BREATHING, DEEP BREATHING AND SAVITRI PRANAYAM TYPE BREATHING ON HEART RATE AND MEAN VENTRICULAR QRS AXIS WAS INVESTIGATED IN YOUNG, HEALTHY UNTRAINED SUBJECTS. PRANAYAM TYPE BREATHING PRODUCED SIGNIFICANT CARDIOACCELERATION AND INCREASE IN QRS AXIS DURING THE INSPIRATORY PHASE AS COMPARED TO EUPNEA. ON THE OTHER HAND, EXPIRATORY EFFORT DURING PRANAYAM TYPE BREATHING DID NOT PRODUCE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN HEART RATE OR QRS AXIS. THE CHANGES IN HEART RATE AND QRS AXIS DURING THE INSPIRATORY AND EXPIRATORY PHASES OF PRANAYAM TYPE BREATHING WERE SIMILAR TO THE CHANGES OBSERVED DURING THE CORRESPONDING PHASES OF DEEP BREATHING.	1986	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
6  480  34 CLINICAL EFFECTS OF YOGA ON ASTHMATIC PATIENTS: A PRELIMINARY CLINICAL TRIAL. BACKGROUND: ASTHMA IS ONE OF THE COMMONEST RESPIRATORY DISEASES IN JIMMA AREA AS WELL AS A SIGNIFICANT DISEASE BURDEN WORLDWIDE COSTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. ANTI-ASTHMATIC DRUGS THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET ARE EXPENSIVE AND HAVE ADVERSE EFFECTS. THUS, IT IS WISE TO LOOK FOR AN ADJUNCT THERAPY TO ALLEVIATE THESE PROBLEMS. THEREFORE, THE MAIN AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO SEE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON PATTERNS OF CLINICAL FEATURES, PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATES AND USE OF DRUGS IN ASTHMATIC PATIENTS. METHODS: A PRELIMINARY CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON 24 VOLUNTEER ASTHMATIC PATIENTS WHO WERE GETTING SUPPORT AT THE MISSIONARY OF CHARITY. THEY WERE GROUPED IN YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS. AN INDIAN YOGA EXPERT THROUGH A TRANSLATOR CONDUCTED THE TRAINING ON YOGIC PRACTICE, YOGIC POSTURE, BREATH SLOWING TECHNIQUE AND DISCUSSION AT THE END. THEN, THE YOGA GROUPS WERE SUPERVISED FOR FOUR WEEKS TAKING YOGA EXERCISE DAILY FOR 50 MINUTES. PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE WAS TAKEN USING THE MINI WRIGHT PEAK FLOW METER AND VITAL SIGNS WERE MEASURED IN BOTH GROUPS. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING WEB BASED GRAPH PAD QUICK CALCS STATISTICAL SOFTWARE. RESULTS: THE MALE TO FEMALE RATIO WAS 1:1 IN BOTH CASES AND CONTROL GROUPS, 8(66.7%) WERE CHRISTIAN AND 9 (75.0%) WERE FARMERS. THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED 66.7% REDUCTION IN THE USE OF SALBUTAMOLE PUFF AND 58.3% SALBUTAMOLE TABLETS. THERE WAS A 10% INCREMENT IN THE PEFR IN THE YOGA GROUP WHILE ONLY 2% IN THE CONTROL GROUP. THERE WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DAY AND NIGHT ASTHMA ATTACKS IN THE YOGA GROUP. CONCLUSION: YOGA EXERCISE AMONG ASTHMATIC PATIENTS RESULTED IN A DECREASED NUMBER OF DAY AND NIGHT ATTACKS AND USE OF DRUGS. IT ALSO SHOWS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE. FURTHER LARGE SCALE STUDY IS RECOMMENDED.	2010	

7 1706  23 PATTERN OF BREATHING AND VENTILATORY RESPONSE TO CO2 IN SUBJECTS PRACTICING HATHA-YOGA. WE STUDIED EIGHT BELGIAN SUBJECTS WELL ADVANCED IN THE PRACTICE OF HATHA-YOGA AND COMPARED THEM WITH EIGHT SEX-, AGE-, AND HEIGHT-MATCHED CONTROL SUBJECTS. PRACTICE OF YOGA (RANGE 4-12 YR) INVOLVES CONTROL OF POSTURE AND MANIPULATION OF BREATHING, INCLUDING SLOW NEAR-VITAL CAPACITY MANEUVERS ACCOMPANIED BY APNEA AT END INSPIRATION AND END EXPIRATION. AVERAGE VALUES FOR THE YOGA AND THE CONTROL GROUP (IN PARENTHESES) ARE AS FOLLOWS: VENTILATION (VE) 5.53 1 X MIN-1 (7.07); TIDAL VOLUME (VT), 1.03 LITERS (0.56); RATE OF BREATHING, 5.5 MIN-1 (13.4); END-TIDAL PCO2, 39.0 TORR (35.3). ALL DIFFERENCES ARE SIGNIFICANT (P LESS THAN 0.05). VENTILATORY RESPONSE TO CO2 (REBREATHING TECHNIQUE) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN THE YOGA GROUP (P LESS THAN 0.01). THE REGRESSION RELATING VE TO VT DURING REBREATHING OF CO2 WAS VE = 8.1 (VT - 0.23) FOR THE YOGA GROUP AND VE = 15.8 (VT - 0.16) FOR THE CONTROL GROUP (P LESS THAN 0.005). WE ATTRIBUTE THESE CHANGES TO CHRONIC MANIPULATION OF RESPIRATION.	1981	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
8 2547  34 YOGA FOR BRONCHIAL ASTHMA: A CONTROLLED STUDY. FIFTY THREE PATIENTS WITH ASTHMA UNDERWENT TRAINING FOR TWO WEEKS IN AN INTEGRATED SET OF YOGA EXERCISES, INCLUDING BREATHING EXERCISES, SURYANAMASKAR, YOGASANA (PHYSICAL POSTURES), PRANAYAMA (BREATH SLOWING TECHNIQUES), DHYANA (MEDITATION), AND A DEVOTIONAL SESSION, AND WERE TOLD TO PRACTISE THESE EXERCISES FOR 65 MINUTES DAILY. THEY WERE THEN COMPARED WITH A CONTROL GROUP OF 53 PATIENTS WITH ASTHMA MATCHED FOR AGE, SEX, AND TYPE AND SEVERITY OF ASTHMA, WHO CONTINUED TO TAKE THEIR USUAL DRUGS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN THE GROUP WHO PRACTISED YOGA IN THE WEEKLY NUMBER OF ATTACKS OF ASTHMA, SCORES FOR DRUG TREATMENT, AND PEAK FLOW RATE.

THE VENTILATORY RESPONSE TO HYPERCAPNIA AND ARTERIAL BLOOD GASES DURING UJJAI RESPIRATION OF ONCE PER MINUTE FOR AN HOUR WERE DETERMINED IN A PROFESSIONAL HATHA YOGI. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT LOWER CHEMOSENSITIVITY TO HYPERCAPNIA IN YOGA PRACTITIONERS MAY BE DUE TO AN ADAPTATION TO LOW ARTERIAL PH AND HIGH PACO2 FOR LONG PERIODS.	2002	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
10  865  40 EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICES ON PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS INCLUDING TRANSFER FACTOR OF LUNG FOR CARBON MONOXIDE (TLCO) IN ASTHMA PATIENTS. PRANA IS THE ENERGY, WHEN THE SELF-ENERGIZING FORCE EMBRACES THE BODY WITH EXTENSION AND EXPANSION AND CONTROL, IT IS PRANAYAMA. IT MAY AFFECT THE MILIEU AT THE BRONCHIOLES AND THE ALVEOLI PARTICULARLY AT THE ALVEOLO-CAPILLARY MEMBRANE TO FACILITATE DIFFUSION AND TRANSPORT OF GASES. IT MAY ALSO INCREASE OXYGENATION AT TISSUE LEVEL. AIM OF OUR STUDY IS TO COMPARE PULMONARY FUNCTIONS AND DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN PATIENTS OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA BEFORE AND AFTER YOGIC INTERVENTION OF 2 MONTHS. SIXTY STABLE ASTHMATIC-PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS I.E GROUP 1 (YOGA TRAINING GROUP) AND GROUP 2 (CONTROL GROUP). EACH GROUP INCLUDED THIRTY PATIENTS. LUNG FUNCTIONS WERE RECORDED ON ALL PATIENTS AT BASELINE, AND THEN AFTER TWO MONTHS. GROUP 1 SUBJECTS SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT (P<0.001) IN TRANSFER FACTOR OF THE LUNG FOR CARBON MONOXIDE (TLCO), FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1ST SEC (FEV1), PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR), MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION (MVV) AND SLOW VITAL CAPACITY (SVC) AFTER YOGA PRACTICE. QUALITY OF LIFE ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT PRANAYAMA & YOGA BREATHING AND STRETCHING POSTURES ARE USED TO INCREASE RESPIRATORY STAMINA, RELAX THE CHEST MUSCLES, EXPAND THE LUNGS, RAISE ENERGY LEVELS, AND CALM THE BODY.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
11  214  37 A STUDY OF THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA. THE ROLE OF YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES, AS AN ADJUNCT TREATMENT FOR BRONCHIAL ASTHMA IS WELL RECOGNIZED. ONE HUNDRED TWENTY PATIENTS OF ASTHMA WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS I.E GROUP A (YOGA TRAINING GROUP) AND GROUP B (CONTROL GROUP). EACH GROUP INCLUDED SIXTY PATIENTS. PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS WERE PERFORMED ON ALL THE PATIENTS AT BASELINE, AFTER 4 WEEKS AND THEN AFTER 8 WEEKS. MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS IN THE TWO GROUPS HAD MILD DISEASE (34 PATIENTS IN GROUP A AND 32 IN GROUP B). GROUP A SUBJECTS SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASING TREND (P < 0.01) IN % PREDICTED PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN THE FIRST SECOND (FEV1), FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), FORCED MID EXPIRATORY FLOW IN 0.25-0.75 SECONDS (FEF25-75) AND FEV1/FVC% RATIO AT 4 WEEKS AND 8 WEEKS AS COMPARED TO GROUP B. THUS, YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES USED ADJUNCTIVELY WITH STANDARD PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
12 2363  29 VOLUNTARILY INDUCED VOMITING - A YOGA TECHNIQUE TO ENHANCE PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN HEALTHY HUMANS. VOMITING IS A COMPLEX AUTONOMIC REFLEX ORCHESTRATED BY SEVERAL NEUROLOGICAL CENTRES IN THE BRAIN. VAGUS, THE CRANIAL NERVE PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN REGULATION OF VOMITING. KUNJAL KRIYA (VOLUNTARILY INDUCED VOMITING), IS A YOGIC CLEANSING TECHNIQUE WHICH INVOLVES VOLUNTARILY INDUCING VOMITING AFTER DRINKING SALINE WATER (5%) ON EMPTY STOMACH. THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED WITH AN OBJECTIVE TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECT OF VOLUNTARY INDUCED VOMITING (VIV) ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN EXPERIENCED PRACTITIONERS AND NOVICES AND DERIVE ITS POSSIBLE THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS. EIGHTEEN HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS VOLUNTEERED FOR THE STUDY OF WHICH NINE HAD PRIOR EXPERIENCE OF VIV WHILE NINE DID NOT. PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS WERE PERFORMED BEFORE AND AFTER 10 MIN OF REST FOLLOWING VIV. ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE WAS PERFORMED ADJUSTED FOR GENDER AND BASELINE VALUES. NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE OBSERVED ACROSS GENDERS. THE RESULTS OF THE PRESENT STUDY SUGGEST A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SLOW VITAL CAPACITY [F(1,13) = 5.699; P = 0.03] AND FORCED INSPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1ST SECOND [P = 0.02] AND REDUCTION IN EXPIRATORY RESERVE VOLUME [F(1,13) = 5.029; P = 0.04] AND RESPIRATORY RATE [F(1,13) = 3.244, P = 0.09]. THESE CHANGES SUGGEST THE POSSIBLE ROLE OF VIV IN ENHANCING THE ENDURANCE OF THE RESPIRATORY MUSCLES, DECREASED AIRWAY RESISTANCE, BETTER EMPTYING OF LUNGS AND VAGAL PREDOMINANCE RESPECTIVELY. WE CONCLUDE THAT VIV WHEN PRACTICED REGULARLY ENHANCES THE ENDURANCE OF THE RESPIRATORY MUSCLES AND DECREASES AIRWAY RESISTANCE. THESE FINDINGS ALSO INDICATE NEED FOR SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF VIV IN THE MANAGEMENT OF MOTION SICKNESS AND RESTRICTIVE PULMONARY DISORDERS LIKE BRONCHITIS AND BRONCHIAL ASTHMA.	2018	
                                                                                                  
13 1855  21 RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA AND BIO-FEEDBACK IN MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION. 34 HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS WERE ASSIGNED AT RANDOM EITHER TO SIX WEEKS' TREATMENT BY YOGA RELAXATION METHODS WITH BIO-FEEDBACK OR TO PLACEBO THERAPY (GENERAL RELAXATION). BOTH GROUPS SHOWED A REDUCTION IN BLOOD-PRESSURE (FROM 168/100 TO 141/84 MM. HG IN THE TREATED GROUP AND FROM 169/101 TO 160/96 MM HG IN THE CONTROL GROUP). THE DIFFERENCE WAS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT. THE CONTROL GROUP WAS THEN TRAINED IN YOGA RELAXATION, AND THEIR BLOOD-PRESSURE FELL TO THAT OF THE OTHER GROUP (NOW USED AS CONTROLS).	1975	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
14 1101  33 EFFECTS OF YOGA TRAINING IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. INTRODUCTION: CURRENTLY, SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE ASSESSED THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON THE MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD), BUT THESE STUDIES INVOLVED A WIDE VARIATION OF SAMPLE AND CONVEY INCONCLUSIVE RESULTS. HENCE, THE PRESENT STUDY WAS PERFORMED A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA TRAINING IN COPD PATIENTS. METHODS: PUBMED, EMBASE, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, GOOGLE SCHOLAR, AND CLINICALTRIALS.GOV DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR RELEVANT STUDIES. THE PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN ONE SECOND (FEV1), FEV1% PREDICTED (% PRED). SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED 6-MIN WALKING DISTANCE (6 MWD), ARTERIAL OXYGEN TENSION (PAO2), AND ARTERIAL CARBON DIOXIDE TENSION (PACO2). WEIGHTED MEAN DIFFERENCES (WMDS) AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CIS) WERE CALCULATED, AND HETEROGENEITY WAS ASSESSED WITH THE I(2) TEST. RESULTS: FIVE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) INVOLVING 233 PATIENTS FULFILLED THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. YOGA TRAINING SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED FEV1 (WMD: 123.57 ML, 95% CI: 4.12-243, P=0.04), FEV1% PRED (WMD: 3.90%, 95% CI: 2.27-5.54, P<0.00001), AND 6 MWD (WMD: 38.84 M, 95% CI: 15.52-62.16, P=0.001). HOWEVER, YOGA TRAINING HAD NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON PAO2 (WMD: 1.29 MMHG, 95% CI: -1.21-3.78, P=0.31) AND PACO2 (WMD: -0.76 MMHG, 95% CI: -2.06-0.53, P=0.25). CONCLUSIONS: THE CURRENT LIMITED EVIDENCE SUGGESTED THAT YOGA TRAINING HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON IMPROVING LUNG FUNCTION AND EXERCISE CAPACITY AND COULD BE USED AS AN ADJUNCT PULMONARY REHABILITATION PROGRAM IN COPD PATIENTS. HOWEVER, FURTHER STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO SUBSTANTIATE OUR PRELIMINARY FINDINGS AND TO INVESTIGATE THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA TRAINING.	2014

TWENTYFIVE NORMAL MALE VOLUNTEERS UNDERGOING A TEN WEEKS COURSE IN THE PRACTICE OF YOGA HAVE BEEN STUDIED BY SOME PARAMETERS OF VENTILATORY FUNCTIONS TESTS. THE OBSERVATIONS RECORDED AT THE END OF TEN WEEKS OF THE COURSE HAVE SHOWN IMPROVED VENTILATORY FUNCTIONS IN THE FORM OF LOWERED RESPIRATORY RATE, INCREASED FORCED VITAL CAPACITY, FEV1, MAXIMUM BREATHING CAPACITY AND BREATH HOLDING TIME, WHILE TIDAL VOLUME AND %FEV1, DID NOT REVEAL ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. THUS, A COMBINED PRACTICE OF YOGA SEEMS TO BE BENEFICIAL ON RESPIRATORY EFFICIENCY.	1988	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
16 2905  37 [LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF BREATHING EXERCISES AND YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA]. TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF BREATHING EXERCISES (BE) OR YOGA (Y) ON THE COURSE OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA WE STUDIED 36 SUBJECTS WITH A MILD DISEASE. THE PATIENTS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO 3 GROUPS. 2 OF THEM PARTICIPATED IN A 3 WEEKS TRAINING PROGRAM OF BE OR Y WHILE THE THIRD GROUP RESTED WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL TREATMENT (CONTROL GROUP, C). AT THE END OF THE TRAINING PERIOD THE PATIENTS WERE ASKED TO PRACTISE BE OR Y ON THEIR OWN. DRUG THERAPY AND LUNG FUNCTION PARAMETERS BEFORE AND AFTER A BETA 2-AGONIST METERED DOSE INHALER (ALBUTEROL, ALB) WERE RECORDED PRIOR TO THE TRAINING PROGRAM AND IN 4 WEEKS INTERVALS FOR 4 MONTHS THEREAFTER. THE RESPONSE TO THE BETA 2-AGONIST WAS DOCUMENTED CONTINUOUSLY IN 28 PATIENTS. THE MENTAL STATE OF THE PATIENTS WAS ELUCIDATED BY QUESTIONNAIRES.--PRIOR TO THE STUDY A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF INHALED ALB ON THE FEV1 WAS SHOWN WITHOUT ANY SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN GROUP DIFFERENCES. BOTH, BE AND Y, CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT AMELIORATION OF THE MENTAL STATE BUT ONLY THE BE INDUCED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OF LUNG FUNCTION PARAMETERS COMPARED TO THE INDIVIDUAL BASELINE VALUES. THE FEV1 INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY BY 356.3 +/- 146.2 ML (P < 0.05) AND THE VC BY 225.0 +/- 65.5 ML (P < 0.01). THESE LONG-TERM CHANGES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE ACTUAL RESPONSE TO ALB. BE DECREASED THE RV SIGNIFICANTLY BY 306.3 +/- 111.6 ML (P < 0.05), AN EFFECT SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COMPARED TO THE BETA 2-AGONIST (P < 0.01). BE IN COMBINATION WITH ALB CAUSED AN ADDITIVE EFFECT.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	1994

18 1112  27 EFFICACY AND TOLERABILITY OF YOGA BREATHING IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE: A PILOT STUDY. PURPOSE: YOGA-DERIVED BREATHING HAS BEEN REPORTED TO IMPROVE GAS EXCHANGE IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC HEART FAILURE AND IN PARTICIPANTS EXPOSED TO HIGH-ALTITUDE HYPOXIA. WE INVESTIGATED THE TOLERABILITY AND EFFECT OF YOGA BREATHING ON VENTILATORY PATTERN AND OXYGENATION IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD). METHODS: PATIENTS WITH COPD (N = 11, 3 WOMEN) WITHOUT PREVIOUS YOGA PRACTICE AND TAKING ONLY SHORT-ACTING BETA2-ADRENERGIC BLOCKING DRUGS WERE ENROLLED. VENTILATORY PATTERN AND OXYGEN SATURATION WERE MONITORED BY MEANS OF INDUCTIVE PLETHYSMOGRAPHY DURING 30-MINUTE SPONTANEOUS BREATHING AT REST (SB) AND DURING A 30-MINUTE YOGA LESSON (Y). DURING THE YOGA LESSON, THE PATIENTS WERE REQUESTED TO MOBILIZE IN SEQUENCE THE DIAPHRAGM, LOWER CHEST, AND UPPER CHEST ADOPTING A SLOWER AND DEEPER BREATHING. WE EVALUATED OXYGEN SATURATION (SAO2%), TIDAL VOLUME (VT), MINUTE VENTILATION (E), RESPIRATORY RATE (I>F), INSPIRATORY TIME, TOTAL BREATH TIME, FRACTIONAL INSPIRATORY TIME, AN INDEX OF THORACOABDOMINAL COORDINATION, AND AN INDEX OF RAPID SHALLOW BREATHING. CHANGES IN DYSPNEA DURING THE YOGA LESSON WERE ASSESSED WITH THE BORG SCALE. RESULTS: DURING THE YOGA LESSON, DATA SHOWED THE ADOPTION OF A DEEPER AND SLOWER BREATHING PATTERN (VTSB L 0.54[0.04], VTY L 0.74[0.08], P = .01; I>FSB 20.8[1.3], I>FY 13.8[0.2], P = .001) AND A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SAO2% WITH NO CHANGE IN E (SAO2%SB 91.5%[1.13], SAO2%Y 93.5%[0.99], P = .02; ESB L/MIN 11.2[1.1], EY L/MIN 10.2[0.9]). ALL THE PARTICIPANTS REPORTED TO BE COMFORTABLE DURING THE YOGA LESSON, WITH NO INCREASE IN DYSPNEA INDEX. CONCLUSION: WE CONCLUDE THAT SHORT-TERM TRAINING IN YOGA IS WELL TOLERATED AND INDUCES FAVORABLE RESPIRATORY CHANGES IN PATIENTS WITH COPD.	2009	
             
19 2929  31 [YOGA TO IMPROVE ASTHMA CONTROL IN SEVERE ASTHMATICS TREATED WITH BIOLOGICS]. WE CONDUCTED A PROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL STUDY TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN POORLY CONTROLLED SEVERE ASTHMATIC PATIENTS TREATED WITH MAXIMAL INHALED THERAPY AND BIOLOGICS. THE OBJECTIVE OF YOGA WAS TO IMPROVE BREATHING CONSCIOUSNESS, EXERCISING CONTROLLED VENTILATION WITH AND WITHOUT RETENTION, ABDOMINAL BREATHING OBSERVATION, IMPROVEMENT OF INSPIRATORY AND EXPIRATORY MUSCLES, OPENING OF THE CHEST, DIAPHRAGM EXERCISES AND RELAXATION. WE MEASURED EXHALED NITRIC OXIDE, FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN ONE SECOND, FORCED VITAL CAPACITY, ASTHMA CONTROL AND QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRES, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION QUESTIONNAIRES BEFORE AND AFTER THE TENTH YOGA COURSE (PERFORMED TWICE A WEEK). HALF OF THE PATIENTS WHO WERE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE TO THE STUDY DECLINED DUE TO ORGANIZATION PROBLEMS. TWO PATIENTS WERE EXCLUDED DUE TO BRONCHITIS AND ARTHRALGIA RESPECTIVELY. THE ANALYSIS OF THE DATA FROM 12 PARTICIPANTS REVEALED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ASTHMA CONTROL AND ASTHMA QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRES AND A REDUCTION OF ANXIETY.THE REGULAR PRACTICE OF YOGA IN SEVERE ASTHMATICS INSUFFICIENTLY CONTROLLED DESPITE MAXIMAL INHALED TREATMENT AND BIOTHERAPY SEEMS TO BE AN INTERESTING COMPLEMENTARY OPTION TO IMPROVE ASTHMA CONTROL. OUR RESULTS MUST BE CONFIRMED IN LARGER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
20  741  23 EFFECT OF REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE ON RESPIRATORY REGULATION AND EXERCISE PERFORMANCE. YOGA ALTERS SPONTANEOUS RESPIRATORY REGULATION AND REDUCES HYPOXIC AND HYPERCAPNIC VENTILATORY RESPONSES. SINCE A LOWER VENTILATORY RESPONSE IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN IMPROVED ENDURANCE CAPACITY DURING WHOLE-BODY EXERCISE, WE TESTED WHETHER YOGIC SUBJECTS (YOGA) SHOW AN INCREASED ENDURANCE CAPACITY COMPARED TO MATCHED NON-YOGIC INDIVIDUALS (CON) WITH SIMILAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY LEVELS. RESTING VENTILATION, THE VENTILATORY RESPONSE TO HYPERCAPNIA, PASSIVE LEG MOVEMENT AND EXERCISE, AS WELL AS ENDURANCE PERFORMANCE WERE ASSESSED. YOGA (N = 9), COMPARED TO CONTROL (N = 6), HAD A HIGHER TIDAL VOLUME AT REST (0.7+/-0.2 VS. 0.5+/-0.1 L, P = 0.034) AND A REDUCED VENTILATORY RESPONSE TO HYPERCAPNIA (33+/-15 VS. 47+/-15 L.MIN(-1), P = 0.048). A YOGA SUBGROUP (N = 6) WITH MAXIMAL PERFORMANCE SIMILAR TO CONTROL SHOWED A BLUNTED VENTILATORY RESPONSE TO PASSIVE CYCLING (11+/-2 VS. 14+/-2 L.MIN(-1), P = 0.039) AND A TENDENCY TOWARDS LOWER EXERCISE VENTILATION (33+/-2 VS. 36+/-3 L.MIN(-1), P = 0.094) WHILE CYCLING ENDURANCE (YOGA: 17.3+/-3.3; CON: 19.6+/-8.5 MIN, P = 0.276) DID NOT DIFFER. THUS, YOGA PRACTICE WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED EXERCISE CAPACITY NOR WITH SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN EXERCISE VENTILATION DESPITE A SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT RESPIRATORY REGULATION AT REST AND IN RESPONSE TO HYPERCAPNIA AND PASSIVE LEG MOVEMENT.	2016

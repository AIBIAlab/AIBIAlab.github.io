1   42 69 A CASE OF RECTUS SHEATH HEMATOMA CAUSED BY YOGA EXERCISE. RECTUS SHEATH HEMATOMA IS A RELATIVELY RARE CONDITION BUT A SIGNIFICANT CAUSE OF ACUTE ABDOMINAL PAIN. THE ACUTE ABDOMINAL PAIN ASSOCIATED WITH RECTUS SHEATH HEMATOMA CAN MIMIC SEVERAL CONDITIONS, SUCH AS APPENDICITIS, INTESTINAL PROBLEMS (OBSTRUCTION, PERFORATION, HERNIA, MALIGNANCY), AND GYNECOLOGIC DISEASE (OVARIAN CYST, TORSION, TUBO-OVARIAN ABSCESS, ECTOPIC PREGNANCY). CORRECT DIAGNOSIS AND SUBSEQUENT TREATMENT DEPENDS ON CAREFUL HISTORY TAKING AND APPROPRIATE USE OF DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS TO AVOID UNNECESSARY LAPAROTOMY. WE REPORT A CASE OF RECTUS SHEATH HEMATOMA DUE TO NONCONTACT STRENUOUS EXERCISE, YOGA, THAT MIMICKED GYNECOLOGIC DISEASES.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
2 1237 13 FEASIBILITY OF A BRIEF YOGA INTERVENTION FOR IMPROVING ACUTE PAIN AND DISTRESS POST GYNECOLOGIC SURGERY. BACKGROUND: WOMEN UNDERGOING SURGICAL PROCEDURES FOR SUSPECTED GYNECOLOGIC MALIGNANCIES FREQUENTLY EXPERIENCE PAIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS RELATED TO SURGERY. YOGA MAY REDUCE THESE NEGATIVE SURGICAL OUTCOMES. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF EVALUATING A PERIOPERATIVE BRIEF YOGA SKILLS TRAINING (YST) IN THIS POPULATION. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES WERE TO (1) ASSESS THE IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF THE YST ON PAIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS; AND (2) PROVIDE PRELIMINARY DATA FOR FUTURE STUDIES. METHOD: ADULT WOMEN SCHEDULED TO UNDERGO AN EXPLORATORY LAPAROTOMY FOR A SUSPECTED GYNECOLOGIC MALIGNANCY WERE RECRUITED TO THIS ONE-ARM FEASIBILITY STUDY. EACH WOMAN RECEIVED THE YST, WHICH CONSISTED OF THREE 15-MINUTE SESSIONS, ONE BEFORE AND TWO AFTER SURGERY. THE FOLLOWING CONSTRUCTS WERE ASSESSED: FEASIBILITY (RATES OF ACCRUAL, INTERVENTION ADHERENCE, MEASURE COMPLETION, RETENTION, AND LEVEL OF SATISFACTION), IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF THE YST (VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE RATINGS OF PAIN AND DISTRESS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND AFTER EACH SESSION), AND DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS FOR MEASURES TO BE USED IN FUTURE STUDIES. RESULTS: OF THE 33 ELIGIBLE WOMEN, 18 WERE APPROACHED AND 10 AGREED TO PARTICIPATE (MEAN AGE = 54.7 YEARS; 90% WHITE). TWO WOMEN DISCONTINUED THE STUDY PRIOR TO STARTING THE YST SESSIONS. OF THE EIGHT PARTICIPANTS WHO RECEIVED THE YST, FIVE COMPLETED THE PRE-SURGERY SESSION (63%) AND SEVEN COMPLETED (88%) BOTH POST-SURGICAL SESSIONS; ONE WOMAN WITHDREW AFTER ONE YST SESSION. PARTICIPANTS REPORTED HIGH SATISFACTION WITH THE YST. ACUTE PAIN AND DISTRESS DECREASED FROM BEFORE TO IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE YST SESSION WITH MODERATE TO LARGE EFFECTS: PAIN, D'S = -0.67 TO -0.95; DISTRESS, D'S = -0.66 TO -1.08. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATED REASONABLE INDICATORS OF FEASIBILITY. IN ADDITION, PATIENTS SHOWED SHORT-TERM REDUCTIONS IN PAIN AND DISTRESS. NEXT STEPS INCLUDE ATTENTION TO IMPROVING STAFF AVAILABILITY AND INTERVENTION IMPLEMENTATION IN ORDER TO FEASIBLY EVALUATE THE PERIOPERATIVE YST, WHICH SHOWS PROMISE FOR REDUCING POSTOPERATIVE PAIN AND DISTRESS.	2016	

3 2694 17 YOGA INDUCED ACUTE ULNAR NERVE COMPRESSION BY A GANGLION CYST IN GUYON'S CANAL. ACUTE ULNAR NEUROPATHY AT THE WRIST CAN BE DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE, AS IT IS AN UNCOMMON NEUROPATHY WITH VARIABLE CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS AND NUMEROUS ETIOLOGIES. WE PRESENT A CASE OF ACUTE ULNAR NEUROPATHY OF THE DEEP MOTOR BRANCH CAUSED BY A GANGLION CYST IN GUYON'S CANAL. INTERESTINGLY, THIS CASE OF ACUTE LOSS OF MOTOR FUNCTION OCCURRED AFTER THE PATIENT PARTICIPATED IN YOGA (SPECIFICALLY THE DOWNWARD DOG POSITION), AND RESOLVED SPONTANEOUSLY OVER TIME AFTER STOPPING YOGA, WITHOUT SURGICAL EXCISION OF THE GANGLION, SUGGESTING EXACERBATION OR PROTRUSION OF AN OCCULT GANGLION CYST DUE TO INCREASED ACTIVITY AND COMPRESSION OF THE HYPOTHENAR EMINENCE.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
4 2914 19 [SPONTANOUS PNEUMOMEDIASTINUM AFTER YOGA PRACTICE - A CASE REPORT]. PNEUMOMEDIASTINUM IS DEFINED AS INTERSTITIAL AIR IN THE MEDIASTINUM, WITHOUT ANY APPARENT PRECIPATING FACTOR SUCH AS TRAUMA, OESOPHAGEAL PERFORATION OR INFECTIONS. IT IS VERY UNCOMMON AND USUALLY AFFECTS YOUNG OTHERWISE HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS. THE MOST COMMON SYMTOMS ARE CHEST PAIN AND DYSPNEA WITH SUBCUTANEOUS EMPHYSEMA FOUND ON EXAMINATION. TREATMENT IS USUALLY CONSERVATIVE WITH PAIN RELIEF. HERE, WE PRESENT AN UNUSUAL CASE OF A 23-YEAR-OLD PREVIOUSLY HEALTHY MALE WHO WAS DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMOMEDIASTINUM AFTER PRACTISING YOGA. THIS CASE DEMONSTRATES THE NEED TO STUDY PATIENTS WITH CHEST PAIN OF UNKNOWN CAUSE IN DETAILS TO FIND CAUSES.	2009

6 1501 20 INVERTED YOGA AND NEAR SYNCOPE: AN UNUSUAL DIAGNOSIS OF RIGHT VENTRICULAR MYXOMA. PRIMARY CARDIAC TUMORS ARE EXTREMELY RARE AND ARE DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE. ALTHOUGH USUALLY BENIGN IN NATURE, MYXOMAS REQUIRE SURGICAL RESECTION DUE TO THEIR INCREASED RISK OF EMBOLIC AND CARDIAC COMPLICATIONS, WITH THE TIMING OF RESECTION DEPENDENT ON THE PRESENTATION AND SIZE OF THE TUMOR. HOWEVER, IF DIAGNOSED EARLY, PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY BENIGN CARDIAC TUMORS HAVE EXCELLENT PROGNOSIS FOLLOWING SURGERY. THEREFORE, A HIGH INDEX OF SUSPICION AND A WIDE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN DETECTING RARE CONDITIONS THAT CAN AFFECT OTHERWISE HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS. WE PRESENT AN UNCOMMON CASE OF A RIGHT VENTRICULAR MYXOMA THAT WAS DISCOVERED WHEN THE PATIENT WAS PERFORMING INVERTED YOGA AND EXPERIENCED A NEAR SYNCOPAL EPISODE. PATIENT SUBSEQUENTLY UNDERWENT AN ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION AND WAS FOUND TO HAVE A RIGHT VENTRICULAR MYXOMA THAT WAS EXCISED. ALTHOUGH RECURRENCE IS RARE, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR PHYSICIANS TO REMAIN VIGILANT AND CONTINUE CAREFUL AND CONSISTENT FOLLOW-UP FOR PATIENTS WITH A HISTORY OF A CARDIAC MYXOMA.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
7 2873 20 YOGA-INDUCED MYOSITIS OSSIFICANS TRAUMATICA OF THE SCAPHOLUNATE LIGAMENT. BACKGROUND MYOSITIS OSSIFICANS TRAUMATICA (MOT) INVOLVES THE HETEROTOPIC DEVELOPMENT OF LAMELLAR BONE AFTER A TRAUMATIC INJURY. DESPITE BEING TERMED "MYOSITIS," MOT IS NOT LIMITED TO MUSCLE BUT RATHER CAN INVOLVE TENDONS, FAT, AND FASCIA. "TRAUMATICA" REFLECTS THAT LESIONS ARE USUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH A HISTORY OF SIGNIFICANT TRAUMA, THAT IS, FRACTURES OR SURGERY; HOWEVER, MANY REPORTS SUGGEST THEY CAN ALSO BE LINKED TO REPETITIVE LOW-ENERGY INSULTS. IN BOTH CASES, THE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE SECONDARY TO TISSUE INJURY GENERATES A PROLIFERATIVE OSTEOBLASTIC CASCADE. CASE DESCRIPTION WE PRESENT A CASE OF PERSISTENT WRIST PAIN IN A 43-YEAR-OLD WOMAN ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA ACTIVITIES. HER RADIOGRAPHIC STUDIES DEMONSTRATED PARTIAL SCAPHOLUNATE (SL) LIGAMENT TEAR AND AN ASSOCIATED MASS LESION. SURGICAL PATHOLOGY REVEALED MOT INVOLVING THE SL LIGAMENT. LITERATURE REVIEW MOT LESIONS IN THE UPPER EXTREMITY ARE USUALLY LOCALIZED AROUND THE ELBOW, AND CASES IN THE HAND ARE RELATIVELY RARE. THERE ARE NO PRIOR REPORTS OF OCCURRENCES WITHIN THE WRIST JOINT OR IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE SL LIGAMENT. HOWEVER, BIOMECHANICAL STUDIES HAVE QUANTIFIED SIGNIFICANT MECHANICAL STRAINS ACROSS THE SL INTERVAL DURING VARIOUS YOGA POSES. THIS PATTERN OF MICROTRAUMA IS CAPABLE OF GENERATING MOT. CLINICAL RELEVANCE UPPER EXTREMITY WEIGHT-BEARING POSITIONS ARE COMMON IN YOGA AND SUBJECT THE WRIST, ESPECIALLY THE SL INTERVAL, TO HIGH MECHANICAL STRAINS. THIS PATTERN OF MICROTRAUMA SHOULD LEAD THE CLINICIAN TO SUSPECT MOT WHEN ENCOUNTERING A MASS IN THE WRIST, BUT MALIGNANCY AND INFECTION MUST BE RULED OUT.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
8   79 14 A LOW-ENERGY FEMORAL SHAFT FRACTURE FROM PERFORMING A YOGA POSTURE. THE FEMORAL SHAFT IS RARELY THE SITE OF A LOW-ENERGY FRACTURE IN A HEALTHY INDIVIDUAL. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE FRACTURES ARE DUE TO MAJOR TRAUMA SUCH AS MOTOR VEHICLE ACCIDENTS. ALTHOUGH LOW-ENERGY FEMORAL SHAFT FRACTURES DO OCCUR, THEY ARE TYPICALLY IN PATIENTS WITH OSTEOPOROTIC BONE, OR PROSTHESIS RELATED. IN THIS CASE REPORT, WE PRESENT A MAN IN HIS LATE 30S WHO WAS PRACTISING A SPECIFIC YOGA STANCE WHEN HE EXPERIENCED A FEMORAL SHAFT FRACTURE.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
9  533 10 COMPARISON OF TWO TAGTEACH ERROR-CORRECTION PROCEDURES TO TEACH BEGINNER YOGA POSES TO ADULTS. TEACHING WITH ACOUSTICAL GUIDANCE INVOLVES AUDITORY FEEDBACK (E.G., A CLICK SOUND WHEN A DESIRED BEHAVIOR OCCURS) AS PART OF A MULTICOMPONENT INTERVENTION KNOWN AS TAGTEACH. TAGTEACH HAS BEEN FOUND TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE IN SPORT, DANCE, SURGICAL TECHNIQUE, AND WALKING. WE COMPARED THE EFFICACY AND EFFICIENCY OF THE STANDARD TAGTEACH ERROR-CORRECTION PROCEDURE AND A MODIFIED TAGTEACH ERROR-CORRECTION PROCEDURE TO TEACH 4 NOVICE ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS BEGINNER YOGA POSES. BOTH ERROR-CORRECTION PROCEDURES WERE EFFECTIVE FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS; HOWEVER, THE RELATIVE EFFICIENCY OF THESE ERROR-CORRECTION PROCEDURES WAS UNCLEAR.

10 1265 11 FLEXIBILITY-NOT JUST FOR YOGA ANYMORE! OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, NUCLEOSIDES HAVE MAINTAINED A PROMINENT ROLE AS ONE OF THE CORNERSTONES OF ANTIVIRAL AND ANTICANCER THERAPEUTICS, AND MANY APPROACHES TO NUCLEOSIDE DRUG DESIGN HAVE BEEN PURSUED. ONE SUCH APPROACH INVOLVES FLEXIBILITY IN THE SUGAR MOIETY OF NUCLEOSIDES, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL ANTI-HIV AND HBV DRUG TENOFOVIR. IN CONTRAST, INTRODUCTION OF FLEXIBILITY TO THE NUCLEOBASE SCAFFOLD HAS ONLY MORE RECENTLY GAINED SIGNIFICANCE WITH THE INVENTION OF OUR FLEXIMERS.

13 2809 10 YOGA THERAPY: BUILDING A HOLDING ENVIRONMENT FOR SOMATIC AND PSYCHE CHANGE. DRAWING ON IDEAS FROM D.W. WINNICOTT AND THE WORK OF QUAKER THEOLOGIAN PARKER PALMER, THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE CONCEPT OF A HOLDING ENVIRONMENT, ITS REFINED UNDERSTANDING IN THE LITERATURE OVER THE YEARS, AND HOW IT CAN BE OPTIMALLY USED IN YOGA THERAPY. THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT EFFECTIVELY ESTABLISHING A HOLDING ENVIRONMENT CAN FACILITATE BOTH SOMATIC AND DEEP STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN A CLIENT, FACILITATING HEALING FROM PRIMAL WOUNDING AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL RECONNECTION TO THE TRUE SELF.	2015

BY APPLYING THE ANCIENT PARADIGM OF YOGA PSYCHOLOGY TO THIS SUBJECT, NEW UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE SYNDROME EMERGE REGARDING THE POSSIBLE ROLE OF THE PINEAL GLAND, THE CLINICAL PRESENTATION OF THE SYNDROME, AND THE POSSIBLE MECHANISM OF ACTION OF PHOTOTHERAPY. THE ENERGY DEPLETION MODEL PRESENTED HERE TIES TOGETHER SUCH DIVERSE ELEMENTS AS: DOSE-RESPONSE ASPECTS OF PHOTOTHERAPY, ANERGIA AS A PRIMARY SYMPTOM OF SAD, 'SPRING FEVER', MYOFASCIAL PAIN DISORDER, THE ANTI-GONADOTROPHIC EFFECT OF MELATONIN, AND PINEAL SUPERSENSITIVITY IN BIPOLAR PATIENTS. CLINICAL PREDICTIONS ARE MADE, AND SIMPLE RESEARCH PROTOCOLS ARE SUGGESTED WHICH CAN DIRECTLY TEST THE HYPOTHESES GENERATED BY THIS PARADIGM.	1990	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
15   43 17 A CASE REPORT OF PATIENT PRACTISING YOGA LEADING TO DENTAL EROSION. THE ARTICLE PRESENTS THE CASE OF A PATIENT WHO WAS PRACTISING YOGA (KUNJAL KRIYA) WHICH LED TO DENTAL EROSION. DENTAL EROSION CAN BE DUE TO EXTRINSIC OR INTRINSIC CAUSES. THE INTRINSIC CAUSES INCLUDE VOMITING DUE TO ANOREXIA NERVOSA, REGURGITATION DUE TO ABNORMALITY IN GASTRO-INTESTINAL TRACT OR RUMINATION. A 38-YEAR-OLD MALE PATIENT PRESENTED WITH A RARE AETIOLOGY OF DENTAL EROSION. HE HAD PRACTICED KUNJAL KRIYA ONE OF THE YOGIC EXERCISES DESCRIBED IN ANCIENT INDIA. IN KUNJAL KRIYA THE PATIENT VOMITS ON AN EMPTY STOMACH IN ORDER TO CLEAN HIS OR HER GASTRO-INTESTINAL TRACT. THE PATIENT HAD PRACTICED THIS FORM OF EXERCISE FOR OVER 12 YEARS WHICH HAD LED TO SEVERE DENTAL EROSION. A PROPER CASE HISTORY SHOULD BE EVALUATED FOR EVERY PATIENT SO THAT THEY CAN BE COUNSELLED FOR ANY FACTORS THAT COULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO DENTAL HEALTH. EARLY DIAGNOSIS IS PARAMOUNT IN RECOGNISING THE AETIOLOGY OF DENTAL EROSION SO THAT DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS ON THE DENTITION CAN BE PREVENTED.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
16 1697 16 PAIN UNCERTAINTY IN PATIENTS WITH FIBROMYALGIA, YOGA PRACTITIONERS, AND HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS. BACKGROUND: UNCERTAINTY ABOUT POTENTIALLY PAINFUL EVENTS AFFECTS HOW PAIN IS EXPERIENCED. INDIVIDUALS WITH FIBROMYALGIA (FM) OFTEN EXHIBIT ANXIETY AND CATASTROPHIC THOUGHTS REGARDING PAIN AND DIFFICULTIES DEALING WITH PAIN UNCERTAINTY. OBJECTIVES: THE EFFECTS OF PAIN UNCERTAINTY IN PREDICTABLY HIGH ODDS (HO), PREDICTABLY LOW ODDS (LO), AND EVEN ODDS (EO) CONDITIONS ON SUBJECTIVE RATINGS OF PAIN (PR) AND SKIN CONDUCTANCE RESPONSES (SCR) FOLLOWING THE ADMINISTRATION OF A PAINFUL STIMULUS WERE EXAMINED FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH FIBROMYALGIA (IWFM), HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS (HVS), AND YOGA PRACTITIONERS (YPS). WE HYPOTHESIZED IWFM WOULD DEMONSTRATE THE GREATEST PHYSIOLOGICAL REACTIVITY TO PAIN UNCERTAINTY, FOLLOWED BY HVS AND YPS, RESPECTIVELY. METHODS: NINE IWFM, 7 YPS, AND 10 HVS PARTICIPATED. RESULTS: CUSTOM CONTRAST ESTIMATES COMPARING RESPONSES FOR HO, LO, AND EO PAIN CONDITIONS SHOWED HIGHER SCR FOR IWFM (CE = 1.27, P = 0.01) BUT NOT FOR HVS OR FOR YPS. PR FOR THE EO CONDITION WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN FOR HO AND LO CONDITIONS FOR IWFM (CE = 0.60, P = 0.012) BUT NOT FOR HVS OR YPS. YPS HAD LOWER SCR AND PR THAN DID HVS. CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS SHOW THAT UNCERTAINTY REGARDING PAIN INCREASES THE EXPERIENCE OF PAIN, WHEREAS CERTAINTY REGARDING PAIN MAY REDUCE PAIN RATINGS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH FIBROMYALGIA.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
17 2893 13 YOGAMAN: AN INEXPENSIVE, ANATOMICALLY-DETAILED CHEST TUBE PLACEMENT TRAINER. INTRODUCTION: OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHEST TUBE PLACEMENT IN EMERGENCY MEDICINE TRAINING PROGRAMS HAVE DECREASED, MAKING COMPETENCE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE WITH LIVE PATIENTS PROBLEMATIC. AVAILABLE TRAINERS ARE EXPENSIVE AND MAY REQUIRE COSTLY MAINTENANCE. METHODS: WE CONSTRUCTED AN ANATOMICALLY-DETAILED MODEL USING A HALLOWEEN SKELETON THORAX, DRESS FORM TORSO, AND YOGA MAT. PARTICIPANTS IN A TRIAL SESSION COMPLETED A SURVEY REGARDING EITHER THEIR COMFORT WITH CHEST TUBE PLACEMENT BEFORE AND AFTER THE SESSION OR THE REALISM OF YOGAMAN VS. CADAVER LAB, DEPENDING ON WHETHER THEY HAD PLACED <10 OR 10 OR MORE CHEST TUBES IN LIVE PATIENTS. RESULTS: INEXPERIENCED PROVIDERS REPORTED AN IMPROVEMENT IN COMFORT AFTER WORKING WITH YOGAMAN, (COMFORT BEFORE 47 MILLIMETERS [MM] [INTERQUARTILE RATIO {IQR}, 20-53 MM]; COMFORT AFTER 75 MM [IQR, 39-80 MM], P=0.01). EXPERIENCED PROVIDERS RATED REALISM OF YOGAMAN AND CADAVER LAB SIMILARLY (YOGAMAN 79 MM [IQR, 74-83 MM]; CADAVER LAB 78 MM [IQR, 76-89 MM], P=0.67). ALL EVALUATORS EITHER AGREED OR STRONGLY AGREED THAT YOGAMAN WAS USEFUL FOR TEACHING CHEST TUBE PLACEMENT IN A RESIDENCY PROGRAM. CONCLUSION: OUR CHEST TUBE TRAINER ALLOWED FOR LANDMARK IDENTIFICATION, TISSUE DISSECTION, PLEURA PUNCTURE, LUNG PALPATION, AND TUBE SECURING. IT IMPROVED COMFORT OF INEXPERIENCED PROVIDERS AND WAS RATED SIMILARLY TO CADAVER LAB IN REALISM BY EXPERIENCED PROVIDERS. IT IS EASILY REUSABLE AND, AT $198, COSTS A FRACTION OF THE PRICE OF AVAILABLE COMMERCIAL TRAINERS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
18 2500 13 YOGA AS THE "NEXT WAVE" OF THERAPEUTIC MODALITIES FOR TREATMENT OF INSOMNIA. INSOMNIA RATES CONTINUE TO RISE, ESPECIALLY AMONG SPECIFIC POPULATIONS. CURRENT NONPHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENTS RELY PRIMARILY UPON COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR INSOMNIA (CBT-I), WHICH WAS INTRODUCED IN THE 1970S. NEWER TREATMENTS HAVE INCORPORATED CBT "THIRD WAVE" TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING MINDFULNESS AND ACCEPTANCE TECHNIQUES. YOGA PRACTICE IS WELL SUITED TO COMPLEMENT EXISTING THERAPIES AND TO ADDRESS SLEEP PROBLEMS IN A MORE HOLISTIC WAY. CURRENT THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL APPROACHES TO TREATING INSOMNIA ARE DISCUSSED, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON THE ROLE OF YOGA IN ADDRESSING PRECIPITATING AND PERPETUATING FACTORS IN INSOMNIA THAT HAVE PREVIOUSLY BEEN LARGELY OVERLOOKED.AN ESTIMATED ONE-THIRD OF U.S. ADULTS SUFFER FROM INSOMNIA (CHEN, GELAYE, & WILLIAMS, 2013; MELLINGER, BALTER, & UHLENHUTH, 1985; OHAYON, 2002), AND THE PROBLEM APPEARS TO BE GROWING. WHILE TREATMENT FOR INSOMNIA HAS HELPED TO ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM FOR SOME (IRWIN, COLE, & NICASSIO, 2006; MORIN ET AL., 2009), PREVALENCE OF INSOMNIA IS ON THE RISE, ESPECIALLY AMONG CERTAIN GROUPS, INCLUDING ELDERLY AND MILITARY POPULATIONS (MORIN, 2009; MYSLIWIEC ET AL., 2013). RISING RATES OF INSOMNIA HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO CHANGES IN LIFESTYLE AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS, INCLUDING INCREASED RELIANCE ON TECHNOLOGY AND DECREASED SYNCHRONY WITH NATURAL WAKE-SLEEP RHYTHMS (BRAHINSKY, 2013; WALLACE-GUY ET AL., 2002; YUN, BAZAR, GERBER, LEE, & DANIEL, 2005).	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
19 1614 12 MIND AND CONSCIOUSNESS IN YOGA - VEDANTA: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WITH WESTERN PSYCHOLOGICAL CONCEPTS. STUDY OF MIND AND CONSCIOUSNESS THROUGH ESTABLISHED SCIENTIFIC METHODS IS OFTEN DIFFICULT DUE TO THE OBSERVED-OBSERVER DICHOTOMY. CARTESIAN APPROACH OF DUALISM CONSIDERING THE MIND AND MATTER AS TWO DIVERSE AND UNCONNECTED ENTITIES HAS BEEN QUESTIONED BY ORIENTAL SCHOOLS OF YOGA AND VEDANTA AS WELL AS THE RECENT QUANTUM THEORIES OF MODERN PHYSICS. FREUDIAN AND NEO-FREUDIAN SCHOOLS BASED ON THE CARTESIAN MODEL HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED BY THE HUMANISTIC SCHOOLS WHICH COME MUCH CLOSER TO THE VEDANTIC APPROACH OF UNITARINESS. A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE TWO APPROACHES IS DISCUSSED.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
20 1360 11 IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF YOGA BREATHING WITH INTERMITTENT BREATH HOLDING ON RESPONSE INHIBITION AMONG HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS. BACKGROUND: THERE IS VERY LITTLE EVIDENCE AVAILABLE ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA-BASED BREATHING PRACTICES ON RESPONSE INHIBITION. THE CURRENT STUDY USED STOP-SIGNAL PARADIGM TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA BREATHING WITH INTERMITTENT BREATH HOLDING (YBH) ON RESPONSE INHIBITION AMONG HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIRTY-SIX HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS (17 MALES + 19 FEMALES), WITH MEAN AGE OF 20.31 +/- 3.48 YEARS FROM A UNIVERSITY, WERE RECRUITED IN A WITHIN-SUBJECT REPEATED MEASURES (RM) DESIGN. THE RECORDINGS FOR STOP SIGNAL TASK WERE PERFORMED ON THREE DIFFERENT DAYS FOR BASELINE, POST-YBH, AND POST YOGIC BREATH AWARENESS (YBA) SESSIONS. STOP-SIGNAL REACTION TIME (SSRT), MEAN REACTION TIME TO GO STIMULI (GO RT), AND THE PROBABILITY OF RESPONDING ON-STOP SIGNAL TRIALS (P [R/S]) WERE ANALYZED FOR 36 VOLUNTEERS USING RM ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE. RESULTS: SSRT REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY IN BOTH YBH (218.33 +/- 38.38) AND YBA (213.15 +/- 37.29) GROUPS WHEN COMPARED TO BASELINE (231.98 +/- 29.54). NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE OBSERVED IN GO RT AND P (R/S). FURTHER, THE CHANGES IN SSRT WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT AMONG YBH AND YBA GROUPS. CONCLUSION: BOTH YBH AND YBA GROUPS WERE FOUND TO ENHANCE RESPONSE INHIBITION IN THE STOP-SIGNAL PARADIGM. YBH COULD BE FURTHER EVALUATED IN CLINICAL SETTINGS FOR CONDITIONS WHERE RESPONSE INHIBITION IS ALTERED.	2018

1 2208 106 THE FEASIBILITY AND IMPACT OF A YOGA PILOT PROGRAMME ON THE QUALITY-OF-LIFE OF ADULTS WITH ACQUIRED BRAIN INJURY. OBJECTIVE: THIS PILOT STUDY MEASURED THE FEASIBILITY AND IMPACT OF AN 8-WEEK YOGA PROGRAMME ON THE QUALITY-OF-LIFE OF ADULTS WITH ACQUIRED BRAIN INJURY (ABI). METHODS: THIRTY-ONE ADULTS WITH ABI WERE ALLOCATED TO YOGA (N = 16) OR CONTROL (N = 15) GROUPS. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE QUALITY OF LIFE AFTER BRAIN INJURY (QOLIBRI) MEASURE PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION; INDIVIDUALS IN THE YOGA GROUP ALSO RATED PROGRAMME SATISFACTION. MANN-WHITNEY/WILCOXON AND THE WILCOXON SIGNED RANK TESTS WERE USED TO EVALUATE BETWEEN- AND WITHIN-GROUP DIFFERENCES FOR THE TOTAL AND SUB-SCALE QOLIBRI SCORES, RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS: NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES EMERGED BETWEEN GROUPS ON THE QOLIBRI PRE- OR POST-INTERVENTION. HOWEVER, THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS ON OVERALL QUALITY-OF-LIFE AND ON EMOTIONS AND FEELING SUB-SCALES FOR THE INTERVENTION GROUP ONLY. THE OVERALL QOLIBRI SCORE IMPROVED FROM 1.93 (SD = 0.27) TO 2.15 (SD = 0.34, P = 0.01). THE MEAN EMOTIONS SUB-SCALE INCREASED FROM 1.69 (SD = 0.40) TO 2.01 (SD = 0.52, P = 0.01), AND THE MEAN FEELING SUB-SCALE FROM 2.1 (SD = 0.34) TO 2.42 (SD = 0.39, P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: ADULTS WITH ABI EXPERIENCED IMPROVEMENTS IN OVERALL QUALITY-OF-LIFE FOLLOWING AN 8-WEEK YOGA PROGRAMME. SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS IN SELF-PERCEPTION AND NEGATIVE EMOTIONS ALSO EMERGED. HIGH ATTENDANCE AND SATISFACTION RATINGS SUPPORT THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS TYPE OF INTERVENTION FOR PEOPLE WITH BRAIN INJURY.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
2  494  27 COGNITIVE, PHYSICAL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR ACQUIRED BRAIN INJURIES: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RECENT FINDINGS. YOGA IS A HOLISTIC PRACTICE THAT - WHEN INCORPORATED EFFECTIVELY INTO NEUROREHABILITATION - HAS POTENTIAL TO MEET THE COMPLEX NEEDS OF PERSONS WITH ACQUIRED BRAIN INJURY (ABI). THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW, CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH PRISMA GUIDELINES, INVESTIGATED COGNITIVE, PHYSICAL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES FOLLOWING CONTROLLED TRIALS OF YOGA FOR ABI. THE SEARCH RETURNED SIX ELIGIBLE STUDIES, FOUR OF WHICH FOCUSED SPECIFICALLY ON STROKE REHABILITATION. FOR PERSONS WITH ABI BROADLY, WITHIN-GROUP IMPROVEMENTS WERE FOUND AFTER YOGA FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL ADJUSTMENT, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONING. FOR STROKE SPECIFICALLY, PHYSICAL AND MEMORY RECOVERY WAS GREATER IN THE YOGA GROUP VS. EXERCISE CONTROL, AND WITHIN-GROUP IMPROVEMENTS WERE NOTED FOR MOTOR FUNCTIONING, SELF-EFFICACY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES. LACK OF (1) BETWEEN-GROUP ANALYSES DESPITE THE INCLUSION OF CONTROL GROUPS, AND (2) A COMMON YOGA REHABILITATION PROTOCOL INCLUDING FREQUENCY, LENGTH, AND DURATION OF YOGA MUST BE ADDRESSED IN FUTURE RESEARCH TO ESTABLISH EFFICACY OF THESE INTERVENTIONS. CONSIDERATIONS FOR PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL OUTCOME MEASURES AND CULTURAL FACTORS ARE PRESENTED IN THE CONTEXT OF FUTURE RESEARCH AND CLINICAL DIRECTIONS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
3 1750  30 PILOT STUDY OF YOGA FOR BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WITH POOR QUALITY OF LIFE. INTRODUCTION: STUDIES SHOW BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WITH POOR QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL); HOWEVER, NONE EXCLUSIVELY FOCUS ON SURVIVORS. THIS STUDY ADDRESSES WHETHER HATHA YOGA IMPROVES BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS' QOL. METHODS: 25 BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS COMPLETED SIX WEEKS OF YOGA. OUTCOME MEASURES WERE 5 QOL CATEGORIES EVALUATED USING THE FACT-B SURVEY PRE AND POST-INTERVENTION AND AFTER 6 MONTHS. RESULTS: EACH CATEGORY WAS EVALUATED INDEPENDENTLY, INCLUDING: PHYSICAL (PWB), SOCIAL (SWB), EMOTIONAL (EWB), FUNCTIONAL (FWB), BREAST CANCER SPECIFIC WELL-BEING (BCS), TRIAL OUTCOME INDEX (TOI), FACT-G, AND FACT-B. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT WAS FOUND IN ALL CATEGORIES EXCEPT SOCIAL WELL-BEING (PWB P = .013, EWB P = .005, FWB P = .003, BCS P < .001, TOI P < .001, FACT-G P = .004, FACT-B P < .001). PATIENTS WITH BELOW AVERAGE PRE-INTERVENTION INDEX SCORES (N = 13) SHOWED GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN EWB AND FWB, WHILE THOSE WITH ABOVE AVERAGE PRE-INTERVENTION SCORES (N = 9) SHOWED GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN PWB. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA MAY BE FEASIBLE AND CLINICALLY USEFUL FOR BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WITH POOR QOL.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
4 1607  26 MERGING YOGA AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE: A FEASIBILITY AND PILOT PROGRAM. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS FEASIBILITY AND CHANGES IN OUTCOME MEASURES FOLLOWING THE MERGING YOGA AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE (MY-OT FOR PD) PROGRAM: A 14-SESSION PROGRAM WHICH COMBINED COMMUNITY-BASED YOGA FOR PD, AND FALL-RISK FOCUSED GROUP OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY SESSIONS. SEVENTEEN PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED AN 8-WEEK CONTROL PERIOD CONSISTING OF THEIR NORMAL PARTICIPATION, AND AN 8-WEEK INTERVENTION PERIOD (14 MY-OT FOR PD SESSIONS). THERE WERE FEWER SELF-REPORTED FALLS IN THE INTERVENTION (6) VS. CONTROL PERIODS (10). ONE FALL RISK FACTOR MANAGEMENT SCALE (THE FALL PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT QUESTIONNAIRE, P=.02), AND BALANCE (P<.01) SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT BETWEEN THE CONTROL AND INTERVENTION. THE MY-OT FOR PD PROGRAM IS AN ENCOURAGING OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST-LED PROGRAM, WHICH MAY IMPROVE BALANCE AND REDUCE SELF-REPORTED FALLS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
5 1314  32 HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES AFTER THE MERGING YOGA AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE PROGRAM: A MIXED-METHODS STUDY. BACKGROUND: TO UNDERSTAND CHANGES IN HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) AFTER THE MERGING YOGA AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE (MY-OT FOR PD) PROGRAM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE USED A MIXED-METHODS CONVERGENT DESIGN AND ADMINISTERED THE PARKINSON'S DISEASE QUESTIONNAIRE-8 (PDQ-8), A MEASURE OF HRQOL, WITH 17 PARTICIPANTS. WE CONSIDERED SCORES 8 WEEKS BEFORE MY-OT FOR PD, JUST BEFORE, AND UPON COMPLETION. ADDITIONALLY, WE COMPLETED TWO FOCUS GROUPS FOLLOWING THE PROGRAM WITH 16 PARTICIPANTS TO ASSESS QUALITATIVE CHANGES IN HRQOL. RESULTS: THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN PDQ-8 SCORES BETWEEN TIME POINTS, F(2,32) = 1.60, P = 0.22, PARTIAL ETA(2) = 0.09. PARTICIPANTS DID DISCUSS IMPROVEMENTS IN ALL 8 HRQOL DOMAINS, FREQUENTLY REGARDING MOBILITY AND ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING. CONCLUSION: RESULTS DIVERGED, WITH QUANTITATIVE RESULTS SHOWING NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN HRQOL AND QUALITATIVE RESULTS INDICATING PARTICIPANT PERCEIVED IMPROVEMENTS IN ALL DOMAINS OF THE PDQ-8. THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE EXPLORED FURTHER, AND LONGITUDINAL FOLLOW-UP COMPLETED.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
6  202  40 A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY ON THE ACCEPTABILITY, FEASIBILITY, AND EFFECTIVENESS OF LOVEYOURBRAIN YOGA FOR PEOPLE WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND CAREGIVERS. PURPOSE: TO CONDUCT A MIXED METHODS, PRE-POST, RETROSPECTIVE STUDY ON THE FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE LOVEYOURBRAIN YOGA PROGRAM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PEOPLE WERE ELIGIBLE IF THEY WERE A TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY SURVIVOR OR CAREGIVER, AGE 15-70, AMBULATORY, AND CAPABLE OF GENTLE EXERCISE AND GROUP DISCUSSION. WE ANALYZED ATTENDANCE, SATISFACTION, AND MEAN DIFFERENCES IN SCORES ON QUALITY OF LIFE AFTER BRAIN INJURY OVERALL SCALE (QOLIBRI-OS) AND FOUR TBI-QOL/NEURO-QOL SCALES. CONTENT ANALYSIS EXPLORED PERCEPTIONS OF BENEFITS AND AREAS OF IMPROVEMENT. RESULTS: 1563 PEOPLE (82.0%) PARTICIPATED >/=1 CLASS IN 156 PROGRAMS ACROSS 18 STATES AND 3 CANADIAN PROVINCES. MEAN SATISFACTION WAS 9.3 OUT OF 10 (SD 1.0). MIXED EFFECTS LINEAR REGRESSION FOUND SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN QOLIBRI-OS (B 9.70, 95% CI: 8.51, 10.90), RESILIENCE (B 1.30, 95% CI: 0.60, 2.06), POSITIVE AFFECT AND WELL-BEING (B 1.49, 95% CI: 1.14, 1.84), AND COGNITION (B 1.48, 95% CI: 0.78, 2.18) AMONG TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY SURVIVORS (N = 705). NO IMPROVEMENT WAS FOUND IN EMOTIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL DYSREGULATION, HOWEVER, CONTENT ANALYSIS REVEALED BETTER ABILITY TO REGULATE ANXIETY, ANGER, STRESS, AND IMPULSIVITY. CAREGIVERS PERCEIVED IMPROVEMENTS IN PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH. CONCLUSIONS: LOVEYOURBRAIN YOGA IS FEASIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE AND MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE MODE OF COMMUNITY-BASED REHABILITATION.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONPEOPLE WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS OFTEN EXPERIENCE POOR QUALITY OF LIFE AND DIFFICULTY ACCESSING COMMUNITY-BASED REHABILITATION SERVICES.YOGA IS A HOLISTIC, MIND-BODY THERAPY WITH MANY BENEFITS TO QUALITY OF LIFE, YET IS LARGELY INACCESSIBLE TO PEOPLE AFFECTED BY TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS.PARTICIPANTS IN LOVEYOURBRAIN YOGA, A SIX-SESSION, COMMUNITY-BASED YOGA WITH PSYCHOEDUCATION PROGRAM IN 18 STATES AND 3 CANADIAN PROVINCES, EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN QUALITY OF LIFE, RESILIENCE, COGNITION, AND POSITIVE AFFECT.LOVEYOURBRAIN YOGA IS FEASIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE WHEN IMPLEMENTED ON A LARGE SCALE AND MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE MODE OF, OR ADJUNCT TO, COMMUNITY-BASED REHABILITATION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
7  641  28 DOES A MEDICAL THERAPEUTIC YOGA GROUP INTERVENTION REMEDIATE IMPAIRMENTS COMMONLY FOUND IN PEOPLE WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS? A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) IS A CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM RESULTING IN VARIED PHYSICAL AND COGNITIVE DEFICITS THAT OFTEN CONTRIBUTE TO CHANGES IN POSTURAL CONTROL AS WELL AS DECREASED SELF-EFFICACY AND LOWER PERCEIVED QUALITY OF LIFE. ONE INTERVENTION OFTEN RECOMMENDED FOR THE CONTROL OF MS SYMPTOMS IS REHABILITATION. WHILE REHABILITATION IS OFTEN EFFECTIVE, IT IS TRADITIONALLY DELIVERED IN A UNIDISCIPLINARY MANNER IN PRIVATE-SESSION FORMAT. THIS PILOT STUDY PRESENTS THE USE OF A BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL INTERDISCIPLINARY GROUP YOGA INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE POSTURAL CONTROL, SELF-EFFICACY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MS. METHODS: THIS PILOT STUDY EXAMINED 15 SUBJECTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN A 5-WEEK PROSPECTIVE MEDICAL THERAPEUTIC YOGA (MTY) PROGRAM DESIGNED FOR INDIVIDUALS DIAGNOSED WITH MS. PRE AND POST-TESTING WAS COMPLETED. RESULTS: THE PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED IMPROVEMENTS IN OVERALL BALANCE (T(14)=3.42, P=0.004), DUAL-TASKING (T(13)=2.30, P=0.034), DYNAMIC GAIT (T(14)=-2.311, P=0.021), REACTIVE BALANCE (T(114)=-2.157, P=0.031), AND SELF-EFFICACY (T(12)=3.40, P=0.006). CONCLUSIONS: MTY OFFERS A BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL FRAMEWORK TO PROVIDE INTEGRATIVE INTERDISCIPLINARY CARE ACROSS DISCIPLINES. IN THIS PILOT INVESTIGATION, POSTURAL CONTROL AND FEELINGS OF SELF-EFFICACY IMPROVED. THIS MODALITY OF REHABILITATION WARRANTS FURTHER INVESTIGATION.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
8  732  31 EFFECT OF MINDFULNESS YOGA PROGRAMME MIYOGA ON ATTENTION, BEHAVIOUR, AND PHYSICAL OUTCOMES IN CEREBRAL PALSY: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. AIM: TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFICACY OF AN EMBODIED MINDFULNESS-BASED MOVEMENT PROGRAMME (MIYOGA), TARGETING ATTENTION IN CHILDREN WITH CEREBRAL PALSY (CP). METHOD: TOTAL NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS 42, WITH 24 BOYS (57.1%) AND 18 GIRLS (42.9%); MEAN AGE 9Y 1MO, SD 3Y; GROSS MOTOR FUNCTION CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM LEVELS I=22, II=12, III=8) AND THEIR PARENTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER MIYOGA (N=21) OR WAITLIST COMPARISON (N=21) GROUPS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS ATTENTION POSTINTERVENTION MEASURED BY THE CONNERS' CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE TEST, SECOND EDITION (CCPT). SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED PARENT AND CHILD MINDFULNESS, CHILD QUALITY OF LIFE, PARENTAL WELL-BEING, CHILD EXECUTIVE FUNCTION, CHILD BEHAVIOUR, CHILD PHYSICAL MEASURES, AND THE PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIP. RESULTS: CHILDREN IN THE MIYOGA GROUP DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER ATTENTION POSTINTERVENTION THAN THE WAITLIST COMPARISON GROUP, WITH LOWER INATTENTION SCORES ON THE HIT REACTION TIME STANDARD ERROR (F1,33 =4.59, P=0.04, PARTIAL ETA-SQUARED [ETAP2]=0.13) VARIABLE AND FEWER PERSEVERATION ERRORS (F1,33 =4.60, P=0.04, ETAP2=0.13) ON THE CCPT. INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS ALSO REVEALED THAT SUSTAINED ATTENTION IN THE MIYOGA GROUP WAS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN IN THE WAITLIST COMPARISON GROUP POSTINTERVENTION (F1,37 =5.97, P=0.02, ETAP2=0.14). PARENTS IN THE MIYOGA GROUP DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED MINDFULNESS (MINDFULNESS ATTENTION AWARENESS SCALE; F1,33 =10.130, P=0.003, ETAP2=0.246). INTERPRETATION: MIYOGA OFFERS A LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION THAT IMPROVES ATTENTION IN CHILDREN WITH CP. MIYOGA CAN BE CONSIDERED AS AN ADDITIONAL OPTION TO STANDARD REHABILITATION TO ENHANCE ATTENTION FOR CHILDREN WITH CP. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: MIYOGA, AN EMBODIED MINDFULNESS-BASED MOVEMENT PROGRAMME, CAN ENHANCE ATTENTION (MORE ATTENTIVE AND CONSISTENT PERFORMANCE) IN CHILDREN WITH CEREBRAL PALSY. MIYOGA HAD NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
9 1167  29 EVALUATING THE USE OF MINDFULNESS AND YOGA TRAINING ON FORENSIC INPATIENTS: A PILOT STUDY. FORENSIC INPATIENTS (I. E., INDIVIDUALS FOUND NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR A CRIMINAL OFFENSE ON ACCOUNT OF MENTAL ILLNESS) REPRESENT AN OFTEN MARGINALIZED AND DIFFICULT-TO-TREAT POPULATION. THIS HAS LED TO THE NEED FOR RESEARCH EXPLORING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF NOVEL INTERVENTIONS. A CANADIAN FORENSIC HOSPITAL HAS DEVELOPED AN 8-WEEKS MINDFULNESS AND YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM (MTP). THIS PILOT STUDY EXAMINED THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF THIS PROGRAM ON PATIENTS' MINDFULNESS, STRESS, AND USE OF COGNITIVE AND EMOTION REGULATION STRATEGIES. A SAMPLE OF 13 FORENSIC INPATIENTS (MALE = 92%) PARTICIPATING IN THE MTP PROGRAM COMPLETED SELF-REPORT MEASURES ASSESSING DISPOSITIONAL MINDFULNESS, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND USE OF COGNITIVE EMOTION REGULATION STRATEGIES AT BASELINE, POST-INTERVENTION, AND A 3-MONTHS FOLLOW-UP. REPEATED MEASURE ANOVAS FOUND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE DESCRIBE FACET OF MINDFULNESS (P = 0.03) WITH A LARGE EFFECT SIZE (ETAP (2) = 0.26) AND A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN STRESS (P = 0.003) WITH A LARGE EFFECT SIZE (ETAP (2) = 0.39). PAIRWISE COMPARISONS REVEALED MEDIUM TO LARGE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES BETWEEN BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION FOR BOTH THE DESCRIBE FACET (P = 0.03, HEDGE'S G = 0.55) AND STRESS (P = 0.003, HEDGE'S G = 0.70). HOWEVER, COMPARISONS WERE INSIGNIFICANT BETWEEN BASELINE AND FOLLOW-UP. NO SIGNIFICANT MAIN EFFECTS WERE FOUND ON THE USE OF COGNITIVE EMOTION REGULATION STRATEGIES. THIS PILOT STUDY OFFERS PRELIMINARY SUPPORT FOR THE USE OF THE MTP AS AN ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY IN FORENSIC INPATIENT TREATMENT. FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS NEEDED INTO THE LONG-TERM IMPACTS OF THIS TRAINING.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
10 2138  35 THE EFFECTS OF AN 8-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION ON EXECUTIVE FUNCTION IN OLDER ADULTS. BACKGROUND: FEW SCIENTIFIC STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED MOVEMENT-BASED EMBODIED CONTEMPLATIVE PRACTICES SUCH AS YOGA AND THEIR EFFECTS ON COGNITION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF AN 8-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION ON EXECUTIVE FUNCTION MEASURES OF TASK SWITCHING AND WORKING MEMORY CAPACITY. METHODS: COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS (N = 118; MEAN AGE = 62.0) WERE RANDOMIZED TO ONE OF TWO GROUPS: A HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION OR A STRETCHING-STRENGTHENING CONTROL. BOTH GROUPS PARTICIPATED IN HOUR-LONG EXERCISE CLASSES 3X/WEEK OVER THE 8-WEEK STUDY PERIOD. ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED ESTABLISHED TESTS OF EXECUTIVE FUNCTION INCLUDING THE TASK SWITCHING PARADIGM, N-BACK AND RUNNING MEMORY SPAN AT BASELINE AND FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCES SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY SHORTER REACTION TIMES ON THE MIXED AND REPEAT TASK SWITCHING TRIALS (PARTIAL ETA(2) = .04, P < .05) FOR THE HATHA YOGA GROUP. HIGHER ACCURACY WAS RECORDED ON THE SINGLE TRIALS (PARTIAL ETA(2) = .05, P < .05), THE 2-BACK CONDITION OF THE N-BACK (PARTIAL ETA(2) = .08, P < .001), AND PARTIAL RECALL SCORES (PARTIAL ETA(2) = .06, P < .01) OF RUNNING SPAN TASK. CONCLUSIONS: FOLLOWING 8 WEEKS OF YOGA PRACTICE, PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED PERFORMANCE ON THE EXECUTIVE FUNCTION MEASURES OF WORKING MEMORY CAPACITY AND EFFICIENCY OF MENTAL SET SHIFTING AND FLEXIBILITY COMPARED WITH THEIR STRETCHING-STRENGTHENING COUNTERPARTS. ALTHOUGH THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED, THESE RESULTS DEMAND LARGER SYSTEMATIC TRIALS TO THOROUGHLY EXAMINE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON EXECUTIVE FUNCTION AS WELL AS ACROSS OTHER DOMAINS OF COGNITION, AND ITS POTENTIAL TO MAINTAIN OR IMPROVE COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING IN THE AGING PROCESS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
11  827  32 EFFECT OF YOGA ON IMMUNE PARAMETERS, COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS, AND QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG HIV-POSITIVE CHILDREN/ADOLESCENTS: A PILOT STUDY. CONTEXT: HIV/AIDS INDIVIDUALS HAVE PROBLEMS RELATING TO IMMUNE SYSTEM, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), AND COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS (CFS). YOGA IS FOUND TO BE USEFUL IN SIMILAR CONDITIONS. HARDLY, ANY WORK IS REPORTED ON YOGA FOR HIV-POSITIVE ADULTS/ADOLESCENTS. HENCE, THIS STUDY IS IMPORTANT. AIM: THE AIM OF THE STUDY IS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON IMMUNE PARAMETERS, CFS, AND QOL OF HIV-POSITIVE CHILDREN/ADOLESCENTS. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: SINGLE-GROUP, PRE-POST STUDY WITH 4-MONTH YOGA INTERVENTION. METHODS: THE STUDY HAD 18 CHILDREN FROM AN HIV/AIDS REHABILITATION CENTER FOR CHILDREN/ADOLESCENTS. CD4, CD8, CD4/CD8 RATIO, AND VIRAL LOADS WERE STUDIED. CF TESTS INCLUDED SIX LETTER CANCELLATION TEST, SYMBOL DIGIT MODALITIES TEST, DIGIT-SPAN FORWARD BACKWARD TEST, AND STROOP TESTS. QOL WAS ASSESSED USING PEDSQL-QOL AND FATIGUE QUESTIONNAIRE. DEPRESSION WAS ASSESSED USING CDI2-SR. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: T-TEST AND WILCOXON SIGNED-RANK TESTS, AS APPLICABLE. RESULTS: THE STUDY INCLUDED 18 CHILDREN/ADOLESCENTS. THERE WAS IMPROVEMENT IN GENERAL HEALTH OF THE PARTICIPANTS. THERE WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CD4 CELLS COUNTS (P = 0.039) AND SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN VIRAL LOAD (P = 0.041). CD4/CD8 RATIO MOVED TO NORMAL RANGE. QOL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED.

12   97  30 A NONRANDOMIZED COMPARISON STUDY OF SELF-HYPNOSIS, YOGA, AND COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY TO REDUCE EMOTIONAL DISTRESS IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. THE AUTHORS ASKED BREAST CANCER (BC) PATIENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN 1 OF 3 MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS (COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT), YOGA, OR SELF-HYPNOSIS) TO EXPLORE THEIR FEASIBILITY, EASE OF COMPLIANCE, AND IMPACT ON THE PARTICIPANTS' DISTRESS, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), SLEEP, AND MENTAL ADJUSTMENT. NINETY-NINE PATIENTS COMPLETED AN INTERVENTION (CBT: N = 10; YOGA: N = 21; AND SELF-HYPNOSIS: N = 68). RESULTS SHOWED HIGH FEASIBILITY AND HIGH COMPLIANCE. AFTER THE INTERVENTIONS, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT IN THE CBT GROUP BUT SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECTS ON DISTRESS IN THE YOGA AND SELF-HYPNOSIS GROUPS, AND, ALSO, ON QOL, SLEEP, AND MENTAL ADJUSTMENT IN THE SELF-HYPNOSIS GROUP. IN CONCLUSION, MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS CAN DECREASE DISTRESS IN BC PATIENTS, BUT RCTS ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE FINDINGS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
13 1234  33 FEASIBILITY AND RESULTS OF A CASE STUDY OF YOGA TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING IN PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY. PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS MIXED-METHODS CASE STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER AN 8-WEEK 1:1 YOGA PROGRAM WAS FEASIBLE AND BENEFICIAL TO PEOPLE WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI). METHOD: THIS WAS A MIXED-METHODS CASE STUDY OF ONE-TO-ONE YOGA FOR PEOPLE WITH TBI INCLUDED THREE PEOPLE. WE COMPLETED ASSESSMENTS BEFORE AND AFTER THE 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION AND INCLUDED MEASURES OF BALANCE, BALANCE CONFIDENCE, PAIN, RANGE OF MOTION, STRENGTH AND MOBILITY. QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WERE INCLUDED AT THE POST-ASSESSMENT. WE INCLUDE A PERCENT CHANGE CALCULATION AND SALIENT QUOTES THAT REPRESENT THE PERCEIVED IMPACT OF THE YOGA INTERVENTION. RESULTS: ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE YOGA INTERVENTION AND ALL DEMONSTRATED IMPROVEMENTS IN PHYSICAL OUTCOME MEASURES. FOR THE GROUP, BALANCE INCREASED BY 36%, BALANCE CONFIDENCE BY 39%, LOWER EXTREMITY STRENGTH BY 100% AND ENDURANCE BY 105%. QUALITATIVE DATA SUPPORT THE USE OF YOGA TO IMPROVE MULTIPLE ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING, ONE PARTICIPANT STATED: "I MEAN IT'S ROCKED MY WORLD. IT'S CHANGED MY LIFE. I MEAN ALL THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS. I MEAN PHYSICALLY, EMOTIONALLY, MENTALLY, IT'S GIVEN ME YOU KNOW MY LIFE BACK...". CONCLUSIONS: YOGA, DELIVERED IN A ONE-TO-ONE SETTING, APPEARS TO BE FEASIBLE AND BENEFICIAL TO PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC TBI. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: CHRONIC TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI) LEADS TO MANY ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING IMPAIRMENT. YOGA DELIVERED IN A ONE-TO-ONE SETTING MAY BE FEASIBLE AND BENEFICIAL FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC TBI.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
14 1037  31 EFFECTS OF YOGA IN MEN WITH PROSTATE CANCER ON QUALITY OF LIFE AND IMMUNE RESPONSE: A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF PROSTATE CANCER IS ASSOCIATED WITH ANXIETY, FEAR, AND DEPRESSION IN UP TO ONE-THIRD OF MEN. YOGA IMPROVES HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) IN PATIENTS WITH SEVERAL TYPES OF CANCER, BUT EVIDENCE OF ITS EFFICACY IN ENHANCING QOL IS LACKING IN PROSTATE CANCER. METHODS: IN THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY, 29 MEN NEWLY DIAGNOSED WITH LOCALIZED PROSTATE CANCER WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA FOR 6 WEEKS (N = 14) OR STANDARD-OF-CARE (N = 15) BEFORE RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS SELF-REPORTED QOL, ASSESSED BY THE EXPANDED PROSTATE INDEX COMPOSITE (EPIC), FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CANCER THERAPY-PROSTATE (FACT-P), FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CHRONIC ILLNESS THERAPY-FATIGUE (FACIT-F), FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CANCER THERAPY-GENERAL (FACT-G) AT BASELINE, PREOPERATIVELY, AND 6 WEEKS POSTOPERATIVELY. SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE CHANGES IN IMMUNE CELL STATUS AND CYTOKINE LEVELS WITH YOGA. RESULTS: THE GREATEST BENEFIT OF YOGA ON QOL WAS SEEN IN EPIC-SEXUAL (MEAN DIFFERENCE, 8.5 POINTS), FACIT-F (6.3 POINTS), FACT-FUNCTIONAL WELLBEING (8.6 POINTS), FACT-PHYSICAL WELLBEING (5.5 POINTS), AND FACT-SOCIAL WELLBEING (14.6 POINTS). THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED INCREASED NUMBERS OF CIRCULATING CD4+ AND CD8+ T-CELLS, MORE PRODUCTION OF INTERFERON-GAMMA BY NATURAL KILLER CELLS, AND INCREASED FC RECEPTOR III EXPRESSION IN NATURAL KILLER CELLS. THE YOGA GROUP ALSO SHOWED DECREASED NUMBERS OF REGULATORY T-CELLS, MYELOID-DERIVED SUPPRESSOR CELLS, INDICATING ANTITUMOR ACTIVITY, AND REDUCTION IN INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINE LEVELS (GRANULOCYTE COLONY-STIMULATING FACTOR [0.55 (0.05-1.05), P = 0.03], MONOCYTE CHEMOATTRACTANT PROTEIN [0.22 (0.01-0.43), P = 0.04], AND FMS-LIKE TYROSINE KINASE-3 LIGAND [0.91 (-0.01, 1.82), P = 0.053]. CONCLUSIONS: PERIOPERATIVE YOGA EXERCISE IMPROVED QOL, PROMOTED AN IMMUNE RESPONSE, AND ATTENUATED INFLAMMATION IN MEN WITH PROSTATE CANCER. YOGA IS FEASIBLE IN THIS SETTING AND HAS BENEFITS THAT REQUIRE FURTHER INVESTIGATION.

15  520  28 COMPARING THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF MEDITATION- AND BREATHING-FOCUSED YOGA PRACTICE IN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS. OBJECTIVES: THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO COMPARE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF MEDITATION- AND BREATHING-FOCUSED YOGA PRACTICE IN UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS. METHODS: A 12-WEEKS YOGA INTERVENTION WAS CONDUCTED AMONG A GROUP OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS ENROLLED IN FOUR YOGA CLASSES AT AN ACADEMICALLY PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITY IN BEIJING, CHINA. FOUR CLASSES WERE RANDOMIZED TO MEDITATION-FOCUSED YOGA OR BREATHING-FOCUSED YOGA. A TOTAL OF 86 PARTICIPANTS FINISHED SURVEYS BEFORE AND AFTER THE 12-WEEKS INTERVENTION, MEASURING WORK INTENTION, MINDFULNESS, AND PERCEIVED STRESS. THE REPEATED-MEASURE MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE (MANCOVA) FOLLOWED BY UNIVARIATE ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED TO EXAMINE THE DIFFERENCES IN WORK INTENTION, MINDFULNESS, AND STRESS BETWEEN THE TWO YOGA INTERVENTION GROUPS OVER THE SEMESTER, AFTER CONTROLLING FOR AGE AND GENDER. RESULTS: THE REPEATED-MEASURE MANCOVA REVEALED SIGNIFICANT GROUP DIFFERENCES WITH A MEDIAN EFFECT SIZE [WILKS' LAMBDA, LAMBDA = 0.90, F(3, 80) = 3.10, P = 0.031, ETA(2) = 0.104]. SUBSEQUENT UNIVARIATE ANALYSES SHOWED THAT STUDENTS IN THE BREATHING-FOCUSED YOGA GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANT HIGHER WORK INTENTIONS [F (1, 82) = 5.22; P = 0.025; ETA(2) P = 0.060] AND MINDFULNESS [F (1, 82) = 6.33; P = 0.014; ETA(2) P = 0.072] BUT MARGINALLY LOWER STRESS [F (1, 82) = 4.20; P = 0.044; ETA(2) P = 0.049] THAN STUDENTS IN THE MEDITATION-FOCUSED YOGA GROUP. CONCLUSION: YOGA PRACTICE WITH A FOCUS ON BREATHING IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THAT WITH A FOCUS ON MEDITATION FOR UNDERGRADUATES TO RETAIN ENERGY FOR WORK, KEEP ATTENTION AND AWARENESS, AND REDUCE STRESS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
16 2398  33 YOGA AND COMPASSION MEDITATION PROGRAM IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE AND SELF-COMPASSION IN FAMILY CAREGIVERS OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE PATIENTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. AIM: TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF THE PRACTICE OF YOGA IN COMBINATION WITH COMPASSION MEDITATION ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE, ATTENTION, VITALITY AND SELF-COMPASSION OF FAMILY CAREGIVERS OF PATIENTS WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 46 VOLUNTEERS WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO TWO GROUPS, THE YOGA AND COMPASSION MEDITATION PROGRAM GROUP (N = 25), AND THE CONTROL GROUP (CG) THAT RECEIVED NO TREATMENT (N = 21). THE PROGRAM LASTED 8 WEEKS, AND COMPRISED THREE YOGA AND MEDITATION PRACTICES PER WEEK, WITH EACH SESSION LASTING 1 H AND 15 MIN. QUALITY OF LIFE, ATTENTION, VITALITY, AND SELF-COMPASSION SCORES WERE MEASURED PRE- AND POSTINTERVENTION. RESULTS: THE YOGA AND COMPASSION MEDITATION PROGRAM GROUP SHOWED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS (P < 0.05) ON QUALITY OF LIFE, ATTENTION, VITALITY AND SELF-COMPASSION SCORES AS COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP, WHICH SHOWED NO STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AT THE POSTINTERVENTION TIME-POINT. CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS OF THE PRESENT STUDY SUGGEST THAT AN 8-WEEK YOGA AND COMPASSION MEDITATION PROGRAM CAN IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE, VITALITY, ATTENTION, AND SELF-COMPASSION OF FAMILY CAREGIVERS OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE PATIENTS.

17 1976  38 SIX-MONTH FOLLOW-UP OF A MINDFULNESS YOGA PROGRAM, MIYOGA, ON ATTENTION, EXECUTIVE FUNCTION, BEHAVIOUR AND PHYSICAL OUTCOMES IN CEREBRAL PALSY. PURPOSE: A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) OF A MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA PROGRAM, MIYOGA, FOR CEREBRAL PALSY (CP) DEMONSTRATED IMPROVED ATTENTION IN CHILDREN AND DECREASED MINDFULNESS IN PARENTS POST-INTERVENTION. THIS PAPER EVALUATES THE RETENTION OF TREATMENT EFFECTS AT 6-MONTHS FOLLOW-UP. METHODS: 42 CHILDREN WITH CP AND THEIR PARENTS PARTICIPATED IN A RCT WITH TWO GROUPS MIYOGA (N = 21) AND WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 21). WAITLIST CONTROL PARTICIPANTS WERE OFFERED MIYOGA FOLLOWING THE POST-INTERVENTION ASSESSMENT. 23 OUT OF 42 CHILD-PARENT DYADS FROM BOTH GROUPS COMPLETED FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENT 6-MONTHS AFTER COMPLETING MIYOGA. THIS PAPER EVALUATES AND REPORTS DATA FROM BOTH GROUPS COLLAPSED (N = 23; MIYOGA N = 11; AND WAITLIST CONTROL N = 12; 47.8% MALE; MEAN AGE = 9:10 +/- 2.4 YEARS) TO ASSESS RETENTION FROM POST-MIYOGA TO FOLLOW-UP AND PRE-MIYOGA TO FOLLOW-UP. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS ATTENTION, MEASURED BY CONNER'S CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE TEST II (CCPT). SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED CHILD EXECUTIVE FUNCTION, PHYSICAL FUNCTION, BEHAVIOUR, QUALITY OF LIFE, CHILD AND PARENT MINDFULNESS, PERSONAL WELLBEING, PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING AND PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIP. RESULTS: PAIRED T-TESTS SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES BETWEEN POST-MIYOGA TO FOLLOW-UP AND PRE-MIYOGA TO FOLLOW-UP FOR VARIABLES THAT SHOWED AN INTERVENTION EFFECT IMMEDIATELY AFTER MIYOGA, NAMELY, CHILDREN'S ATTENTION VARIABLES AND PARENT'S MINDFULNESS. PAIRED T-TESTS SHOWED THAT CHILDREN'S EXECUTIVE FUNCTION AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND PARENT'S WELLBEING IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PRE-MIYOGA TO 6-MONTHS FOLLOW-UP WHICH MAY POTENTIALLY REFLECT SLEEPER OR DELAYED EFFECTS OF MIYOGA. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY IDENTIFIED POSSIBLE DELAYED OR SLEEPER EFFECTS IN CHILDREN'S EXECUTIVE FUNCTION AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND PARENT'S WELL-BEING.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP EVIDENCE FOR RETENTION OF EFFECTS OF MIYOGA ON CHILDREN'S ATTENTION WAS INCONSISTENT; THEREFORE, BOOSTER SESSIONS OR CONTINUED PRACTICE OF MIYOGA AS A LIFESTYLE OPTION ARE NEEDED TO MAINTAIN AN EFFECT ON ATTENTION.BECAUSE MIYOGA CAN BE PRACTISED DURING DAILY ACTIVITIES, IT MAY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR CHILDREN WITH CP, COMPLEMENTING STANDARD REHABILITATION OPTIONS.BY EMBEDDING MINDFULNESS IN CHILDREN AND PARENTS' DAILY ACTIVITIES, MIYOGA, COULD PROVIDE FAMILIES WITH ACCESSIBLE AND TIME-EFFICIENT MEANS OF LEARNING AND PRACTICING MINDFULNESS.	2022	

18   53  32 A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND CLINICAL PILATES TRAINING ON WALKING, COGNITION, RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PERSONS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND CLINICAL PILATES TRAINING ON WALKING, RESPIRATORY MUSCLE STRENGTH, COGNITION, AND QUALITY OF LIFE AND COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF TWO POPULAR EXERCISE METHODS IN PERSONS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (PWMS). METHODS: TWENTY-EIGHT PWMS (PILATES GROUP = 16, YOGA GROUP = 12) RECEIVED THE PROGRAM ONCE A WEEK FOR EIGHT WEEKS IN ADDITION TO HOME EXERCISES. AT BASELINE AND THE END OF THE TRAINING, PARTICIPANTS UNDERWENT ASSESSMENTS. THE OUTCOME MEASURES WERE WALKING SPEED, MOBILITY, BALANCE CONFIDENCE, RESPIRATORY MUSCLE STRENGTH, COGNITION, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. RESULTS: FOLLOWING THE PROGRAM, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN MOBILITY (P = 0.482), PERCEIVED WALKING QUALITY (P = 0.325), RESPIRATORY MUSCLE STRENGTH (MAXIMUM INSPIRATORY PRESSURE: P = 0.263, MAXIMUM EXPIRATORY PRESSURE: P = 0.866), AND COGNITION (SYMBOL DIGIT MODALITIES TEST: P = 0.324, CALIFORNIA VERBAL LEARNING TEST-II: P = 0.514, BRIEF VISUOSPATIAL MEMORY TEST-REVISED: P = 0.279) BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. IMPROVEMENTS WERE HIGHER IN BALANCE CONFIDENCE (P = 0.006), WALKING SPEED (P = 0.004), AND QUALITY OF LIFE (P = 0.019) IN THE CLINICAL PILATES GROUP COMPARED TO THE YOGA GROUP. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY SHOWED POSITIVE EFFECTS IN WALKING AND RESPIRATORY ASPECTS IN PWMS WHO RECEIVED YOGA AND CLINICAL PILATES TRAINING. PILATES TRAINING WAS SUPERIOR IN IMPROVING WALKING SPEED, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND BALANCE CONFIDENCE COMPARED TO YOGA TRAINING.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
19 1250  29 FEASIBILITY STUDY: THE EFFECT OF THERAPEUTIC YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE IN CHILDREN HOSPITALIZED WITH CANCER. PURPOSE: TO DESCRIBE THE EFFECT OF THERAPEUTIC YOGA ON CHILD AND PARENTAL REPORTS OF QUALITY OF LIFE IN CHILDREN HOSPITALIZED WITH ONCOLOGICAL DIAGNOSES. METHODS: SIX CHILDREN PARTICIPATED IN 5 YOGA SESSIONS OVER 2 MONTHS. THE PEDSQL 4.0 WAS ADMINISTERED TO EACH CHILD AND PARTICIPATING PARENT/CAREGIVERS AT BASELINE AND AFTER COMPLETION OF THE YOGA INTERVENTION. THE WILCOXON NONPARAMETRIC RANK TEST MEASURED INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES OVER TIME. RESULTS: STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES (P < .05) WERE FOUND IN CHILD PERCEPTION OF GROSS MOTOR FUNCTION. CONCLUSION: THESE FEASIBILITY STUDY DATA SUGGEST THAT THERAPEUTIC YOGA POSITIVELY AFFECTED CHILD PERCEPTION OF GROSS MOTOR FUNCTION MEASURED ON THE PEDSQL 4.0.

20  769  36 EFFECT OF UNILATERAL LEFT NOSTRIL BREATHING (CHANDRA ANGA PRANAYAMA) ON COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN HEALTHY YOGA-NAIVE INDIVIDUALS: A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED, PILOT STUDY. INTRODUCTION: BREATHING MODULATES CORTICAL NEURONAL ACTIVITY. VARIOUS BREATHING EXERCISES ARE PURPORTED TO HAVE SPECIFIC EFFECTS ON EMOTIONAL AND COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF UNILATERAL LEFT NOSTRIL BREATHING (ULNB) ON NONLATERALIZED, OVERALL COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS USING COMPUTERIZED PSYCHOMETRIC TESTS. METHODS: A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED, PILOT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AMONG 20 HEALTHY YOGA-NAIVE MEDICAL STUDENTS. ULNB WAS PERFORMED FOR 15 MIN BY THE TEST GROUP (N = 10) AND BREATH AWARENESS BY THE CONTROL GROUP (N = 10). ATTENTION AND PROCESSING SPEED, MEMORY, AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION WERE ASSESSED USING THE LETTER-DIGIT SUBSTITUTION TEST, STERNBERG MEMORY TASK, AND VICTORIA STROOP TEST, RESPECTIVELY. BASELINE, PRE- AND POSTINTERVENTION SCORES WERE RECORDED. RESULTS: THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GROUPS IN BASELINE SCORES. IN THE STERNBERG MEMORY TASK, A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN RESPONSE TIME WAS SEEN IN THE TEST (T(9) = 3.855, P = 0.004) AS WELL AS THE CONTROL GROUP (T(9) = 3.120, P = 0.012); THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GROUPS. NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF UNLB WAS SEEN IN THE LETTER-DIGIT SUBSTITUTION TEST AND STROOP TEST. CONCLUSIONS: OUR STUDY SHOWED NO DIFFERENCE IN THE EFFECTS OF 15-MIN PRACTICE OF ULNB AND BREATH AWARENESS ON COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS; BOTH IMPROVED MEMORY BUT NOT ATTENTION OR EXECUTIVE FUNCTION.	2020

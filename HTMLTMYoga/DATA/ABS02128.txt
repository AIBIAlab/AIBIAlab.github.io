1 2128 180 THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN MODIFYING RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND METABOLIC SYNDROME: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. BACKGROUND: YOGA, A POPULAR MIND-BODY PRACTICE, MAY PRODUCE CHANGES IN CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (CVD) AND METABOLIC SYNDROME RISK FACTORS. DESIGN: THIS WAS A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND RANDOM-EFFECTS META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS). METHODS: ELECTRONIC SEARCHES OF MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PSYCINFO, AND THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE PERFORMED FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND RCTS THROUGH DECEMBER 2013. STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IF THEY WERE ENGLISH, PEER-REVIEWED, FOCUSED ON ASANA-BASED YOGA IN ADULTS, AND REPORTED RELEVANT OUTCOMES. TWO REVIEWERS INDEPENDENTLY SELECTED ARTICLES AND ASSESSED QUALITY USING COCHRANE'S RISK OF BIAS TOOL. RESULTS: OUT OF 1404 RECORDS, 37 RCTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND 32 IN THE META-ANALYSIS. COMPARED TO NON-EXERCISE CONTROLS, YOGA SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT FOR BODY MASS INDEX (-0.77 KG/M(2) (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL -1.09 TO -0.44)), SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (-5.21 MMHG (-8.01 TO -2.42)), LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL (-12.14 MG/DL (-21.80 TO -2.48)), AND HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL (3.20 MG/DL (1.86 TO 4.54)). SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE SEEN IN BODY WEIGHT (-2.32 KG (-4.33 TO -0.37)), DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (-4.98 MMHG (-7.17 TO -2.80)), TOTAL CHOLESTEROL (-18.48 MG/DL (-29.16 TO -7.80)), TRIGLYCERIDES (-25.89 MG/DL (-36.19 TO -15.60), AND HEART RATE (-5.27 BEATS/MIN (-9.55 TO -1.00)), BUT NOT FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE (-5.91 MG/DL (-16.32 TO 4.50)) NOR GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN (-0.06% HB (-0.24 TO 0.11)). NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND BETWEEN YOGA AND EXERCISE. ONE STUDY FOUND AN IMPACT ON SMOKING ABSTINENCE. CONCLUSIONS: THERE IS PROMISING EVIDENCE OF YOGA ON IMPROVING CARDIO-METABOLIC HEALTH. FINDINGS ARE LIMITED BY SMALL TRIAL SAMPLE SIZES, HETEROGENEITY, AND MODERATE QUALITY OF RCTS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
2 2118  58 THE EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICE ON GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND OTHER HEALTH PARAMETERS IN THE PREDIABETIC STATE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON GLYCEMIC CONTROL, LIPID PROFILES, BODY COMPOSITION AND BLOOD PRESSURE IN PEOPLE IN THE PRE-DIABETIC STATE. STUDIES ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA ON POPULATION GROUPS UNDER HIGH RISK FOR DIABETES, CALLED PREDIABETIC OR SUFFERING FROM METABOLIC SYNDROMES WERE EXTRACTED FROM A THOROUGH SEARCH OF PUBMED, SCOPUS, COCHRANE LIBRARY, EBSCO AND INDMED DATABASES. BOTH RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) AND NON-RCT STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IN THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. STUDIES PUBLISHED BETWEEN JAN 2002 AND DEC 2018 WERE INCLUDED. STUDIES WERE CONSIDERED FOR EVALUATION IF THEY INVESTIGATED A YOGA INTERVENTION TO PREVENT T2DM, AGAINST A CONTROL GROUP, WHILE ALSO REPORTING GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND OTHER HEALTH PARAMETERS OF T2DM MANAGEMENT. SUMMARY EFFECT SIZES AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CI) WERE CALCULATED USING THE COMPREHENSIVE META-ANALYSIS SOFTWARE IN ADDITION TO PUBLICATION BIAS. OF THE 46,500 IDENTIFIED STUDIES, 14 STUDIES WITH 834 PARTICIPANTS OF WHOM WERE 50% WOMEN, WERE FOUND TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION IN OUR SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OUR QUANTITATIVE SYNTHESIS INCLUDED 12 RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS AND 2 NON-RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS, WITH THE FOLLOW-UP PERIOD RANGING FROM 4 TO 52 WEEKS. COMPARED TO CONTROLS, YOGA INTERVENTION IMPROVED FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE (FBG) [STANDARD MEAN DIFFERENCE (SMD -0.064 MG/DL (95% CI -0.201 TO 0.074)]; LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (LDL) [SMD-0.090 MG/DL (95% CI -0.270 TO 0.090)]; TRIGLYCERIDES [SMD -0.148 MG/DL (95% CI -0.285 TO -0.012)]; TOTAL CHOLESTEROL [SMD -0.058 MG/DL (95% CI -0.220 TO 0.104)] AND SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE [SMD -0.058 MM HG (95% CI -0.168 TO 0.053)]. THIS META-ANALYSIS UNCOVERED CLINICALLY IMPROVED EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON GLYCEMIC CONTROL, LIPID PROFILES AND OTHER PARAMETERS OF T2DM MANAGEMENT IN PREDIABETIC POPULATION. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA INTERVENTION MAY BE CONSIDERED AS A COMPREHENSIVE AND ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO PREVENTING T2DM. FURTHER ADEQUATELY POWERED, WELL DESIGNED RCTS ARE NEEDED TO SUPPORT OUR FINDINGS AND INVESTIGATE THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA IN T2DM PATIENTS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
3  221  53 A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF YOGA FOR HYPERTENSION. BACKGROUND: THE AIM OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS WAS TO EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE AND THE STRENGTH OF RECOMMENDATION FOR YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC MEANS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PREHYPERTENSION AND HYPERTENSION. METHODS: MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, CENTRAL, AND INDMED WERE SCREENED THROUGH FEBRUARY 2014 FOR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS (>/=8 WEEKS) COMPARED WITH USUAL CARE OR ANY ACTIVE CONTROL INTERVENTION ON BLOOD PRESSURE IN PATIENTS WITH PREHYPERTENSION (120-139/80-89 MM HG) OR HYPERTENSION (>/=140/>/=90 MM HG). RISK OF BIAS WAS ASSESSED USING THE COCHRANE RISK OF BIAS TOOL; QUALITY OF EVIDENCE WAS ASSESSED ACCORDING TO THE GRADE RECOMMENDATIONS. RESULTS: SEVEN RCTS WITH A TOTAL OF 452 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED. COMPARED WITH USUAL CARE, VERY LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE WAS FOUND FOR EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SYSTOLIC (6 RCTS, N = 278; MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) = -9.65 MM HG, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) = -17.23 TO -2.06, P = 0.01; HETEROGENEITY: I (2) = 90%, CHI(2) = 48.21, P < 0.01) AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (6 RCTS, N = 278; MD = -7.22 MM HG, 95% CI = -12.83 TO -1.62, P = 0.01; HETEROGENEITY: I (2) = 92%, CHI(2) = 64.84, P < 0.01). SUBGROUP ANALYSES REVEALED EFFECTS FOR RCTS THAT INCLUDED HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS BUT NOT FOR RCTS THAT INCLUDED BOTH HYPERTENSIVE AND PREHYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS, AS WELL AS FOR RCTS THAT ALLOWED ANTIHYPERTENSIVE COMEDICATION BUT NOT FOR THOSE THAT DID NOT. MORE ADVERSE EVENTS OCCURRED DURING YOGA THAN DURING USUAL CARE. COMPARED WITH EXERCISE, NO EVIDENCE WAS FOUND FOR EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SYSTOLIC OR DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE. CONCLUSIONS: LARGER STUDIES ARE REQUIRED TO CONFIRM THE EMERGING BUT LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE THAT YOGA MAY BE A USEFUL ADJUNCT INTERVENTION IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
4 1033  47 EFFECTS OF YOGA IN ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS: A META-ANALYSIS. AIMS/INTRODUCTION: A META-ANALYSIS WAS CARRIED OUT TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE PUBMED, EMBASE AND COCHRANE DATABASES WERE SEARCHED TO OBTAIN ELIGIBLE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE, AND THE SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN A1C, TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL, LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDE AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE. WEIGHTED MEAN DIFFERENCES AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CIS) WERE CALCULATED. THE I(2) STATISTIC REPRESENTED HETEROGENEITY. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 12 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WITH A TOTAL OF 864 PATIENTS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. THE POOLED WEIGHTED MEAN DIFFERENCES WERE -23.72 MG/DL (95% CI -37.78 TO -9.65; P = 0.001; I(2) = 82%) FOR FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE AND -0.47% (95% CI -0.87 TO -0.07; P = 0.02; I(2) = 82%) FOR HEMOGLOBIN A1C. THE WEIGHTED MEAN DIFFERENCES WERE -17.38 MG/DL (95% CI -27.88 TO -6.89; P = 0.001; I(2) = 0%) FOR POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE, -18.50 MG/DL (95% CI -29.88 TO -7.11; P = 0.001; I(2) = 75%) FOR TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, 4.30 MG/DL (95% CI 3.25 TO 5.36; P < 0.00001; I(2) = 10%) FOR HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL, -12.95 MG/DL (95% CI -18.84 TO -7.06; P < 0.0001; I(2) = 37%) FOR LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL AND -12.57 MG/DL (95% CI -29.91 TO 4.76; P = 0.16; I(2) = 48%) FOR TRIGLYCERIDES. CONCLUSIONS: THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT YOGA BENEFITS ADULT PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS. HOWEVER, CONSIDERING THE LIMITED METHODOLOGY AND THE POTENTIAL HETEROGENEITY, FURTHER STUDIES ARE NECESSARY TO SUPPORT OUR FINDINGS AND INVESTIGATE THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA IN TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS PATIENTS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
5  922  52 EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR HYPERTENSION: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVES. TO SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEW AND META-ANALYZE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR REDUCING BLOOD PRESSURE IN ADULTS WITH HYPERTENSION AND TO ASSESS THE MODIFYING INFLUENCES OF TYPE AND LENGTH OF YOGA INTERVENTION AND TYPE OF COMPARISON GROUP. METHODS. ACADEMIC SEARCH PREMIER, ALTHEALTHWATCH, BIOSIS/BIOLOGICAL ABSTRACTS, CINAHL, COCHRANE LIBRARY, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, PSYCARTICLES, NATURAL STANDARD, AND WEB OF SCIENCE DATABASES WERE SCREENED FOR CONTROLLED STUDIES FROM 1966 TO MARCH 2013. TWO AUTHORS INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSED RISK OF BIAS USING THE COCHRANE RISK OF BIAS TOOL. RESULTS. ALL 17 STUDIES INCLUDED IN THE REVIEW HAD UNCLEAR OR HIGH RISK OF BIAS. YOGA HAD A MODEST BUT SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (SBP) (-4.17 [-6.35, -1.99], P = 0.0002) AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (DBP) (-3.62 [-4.92, -1.60], P = 0.0001). SUBGROUP ANALYSES DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN BLOOD PRESSURE FOR (1) INTERVENTIONS INCORPORATING 3 BASIC ELEMENTS OF YOGA PRACTICE (POSTURES, MEDITATION, AND BREATHING) (SBP: -8.17 MMHG [-12.45, -3.89]; DBP: -6.14 MMHG [-9.39, -2.89]) BUT NOT FOR MORE LIMITED YOGA INTERVENTIONS; (2) YOGA COMPARED TO NO TREATMENT (SBP: -7.96 MMHG [-10.65, -5.27]) BUT NOT FOR EXERCISE. CONCLUSION. YOGA CAN BE PRELIMINARILY RECOMMENDED AS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR REDUCING BLOOD PRESSURE. ADDITIONAL RIGOROUS CONTROLLED TRIALS ARE WARRANTED TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
6 2154  43 THE EFFECTS OF THAI YOGA ON PHYSICAL FITNESS: A META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS. OBJECTIVES: THAI YOGA IS A TRADITIONAL THAI EXERCISE USED FOR IMPROVING HEALTH-RELATED PHYSICAL FITNESS. MANY STUDIES HAVE EVALUATED THESE EFFECTS, BUT THEIR RESULTS REMAIN INCONCLUSIVE. THIS META-ANALYSIS AIMED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THAI YOGA ON PHYSICAL FITNESS. DESIGN/METHODS: PUBMED, EMBASE, CINAHL, COCHRANE LIBRARY, THAI LIBRARY INTEGRATED SYSTEM (THAILIS), PHYSIOTHERAPY EVIDENCE DATABASE (PEDRO), NATIONAL REHABILITATION INFORMATION CENTER (REHABDATA), SCOPUS, WEB OF SCIENCE, THAI UNIVERSITY LIBRARY DATABASES/JOURNALS, AND THAI PHYSICAL THERAPY DATABASE UP TO MARCH 2016 WERE SEARCHED FOR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) EXAMINING THE EFFECT OF THAI YOGA EXERCISE COMPARED WITH NORMAL DAILY ACTIVITIES AS CONTROLS, IN ANY LANGUAGE. THE WEIGHTED MEAN DIFFERENCE (WMD) AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (95% CI) WERE PERFORMED USING THE RANDOM-EFFECTS MODEL. RESULTS: SEVEN RCTS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. THAI YOGA TRAINING SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED BODY FLEXIBILITY BY 3.9 CM AFTER 4 WEEKS [95% CI = 3.9-4.0; P < 0.001: NO HETEROGENEITY CHI(2) = 0.66, D.F.2, P = 0.7; I(2) 0.00%] AND 8.9 CM AFTER 8 WEEKS [95% CI = 7.4-10.5; P < 0.001: NO HETEROGENEITY CHI(2) = 0.16, D.F.2, P = 0.9; I(2) 0.00%] COMPARED TO CONTROLS. IT ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED RANGE OF MOTION (ROM) OF RIGHT SHOULDER EXTENSION BY 1.5 DEGREES AT WEEK 8, COMPARED TO CONTROLS [95% CI = 0.12-2.81; P = 0.03; LOW HETEROGENEITY CHI(2) = 1.61, D.F.1, P = 0.2; I(2) 37.9%]. GREATER ROM FOR RIGHT SHOULDER ABDUCTION WAS OBSERVED AFTER 12 WEEKS COMPARED TO CONTROLS [22.2 DEGREES (95% CI = 20-24; P < 0.001): NO HETEROGENEITY CHI(2) = 0.29, D.F.1, P = 0.6; I(2) 0.00%]. CONCLUSIONS: THAI YOGA EXERCISES APPEARED USEFUL, IN PARTICULAR, ON BODY AND RIGHT SHOULDER JOINT FLEXIBILITY. REGULAR STRETCHING EXERCISE OF THAI YOGA AND/OR IN COMBINATION WITH EXERCISES COULD PROMOTE HEALTH-RELATED PHYSICAL FITNESS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
7 2594  60 YOGA FOR METABOLIC SYNDROME: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND METABOLIC SYNDROME IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RISK FACTOR FOR DEVELOPING CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND TYPE 2 DIABETES. THE AIM OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO SYSTEMATICALLY ASSESS AND PERFORM A META-ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON THE PARAMETERS OF METABOLIC SYNDROME. METHODS MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS AND INDMED WERE SEARCHED AND SCREENED FROM THEIR INCEPTION THROUGH TO 8 MARCH 2016 FOR RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS ON YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME. RISK OF BIAS WAS ASSESSED USING THE COCHRANE RISK OF BIAS TOOL. RESULTS SEVEN TRIALS WITH A TOTAL OF 794 PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED. NO EFFECTS OF YOGA ON RESOLUTION OF METABOLIC SYNDROME, DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE, TRIGLYCERIDES, HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL AND FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE WERE FOUND, BUT YOGA WAS SUPERIOR TO USUAL CARE FOR WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE (STANDARDISED MEAN DIFFERENCE (SMD) = -0.35; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) = -0.57 TO -0.13; P < 0.01) AND SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (SMD = -0.29; 95% CI = -0.51 TO -0.07; P = 0.01). HOWEVER, THESE EFFECTS WERE NOT ROBUST AGAINST SELECTION BIAS. NO INTERVENTION-RELATED ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSION BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THIS META-ANALYSIS, NO RECOMMENDATION CAN BE MADE FOR OR AGAINST YOGA IN ORDER TO INFLUENCE THE PARAMETERS OF METABOLIC SYNDROME. DESPITE METHODOLOGICAL DRAWBACKS, AND UNTIL FURTHER RESEARCH IS UNDERTAKEN, YOGA CAN BE PRELIMINARILY CONSIDERED AS A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR REDUCING WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE AND SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE IN INDIVIDUALS WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME WHO ARE NOT ADHERING TO CONVENTIONAL FORMS OF EXERCISE.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
8  223  48 A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON WEIGHT-RELATED OUTCOMES. INTRODUCTION: OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS FOR CHRONIC DISEASES AND PREMATURE DEATH. THE AIM OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO SYSTEMATICALLY ASSESS AND ANALYZE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON WEIGHT-RELATED OUTCOMES. METHODS: MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, AND THE COCHRANE LIBRARY WERE SCREENED THROUGH MARCH 2015 FOR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS ON YOGA FOR WEIGHT-RELATED OUTCOMES IN THE GENERAL POPULATION OR OVERWEIGHT/OBESE INDIVIDUALS. RISK OF BIAS WAS ASSESSED USING THE COCHRANE RISK OF BIAS TOOL ON THE FOLLOWING DOMAINS: SELECTION BIAS, PERFORMANCE BIAS, DETECTION BIAS, ATTRITION BIAS, REPORTING BIAS, AND OTHER BIAS. RESULTS: OUT OF 445 RECORDS IDENTIFIED DURING LITERATURE SEARCH, 30 TRIALS WITH A TOTAL OF 2173 PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED. NO EFFECTS ON WEIGHT, BODY MASS INDEX, BODY FAT PERCENTAGE OR WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE WERE FOUND. IN STUDIES WITH HEALTHY ADULT PARTICIPANTS AN EFFECT OF YOGA COMPARED TO USUAL CARE WAS FOUND REGARDING WAIST/HIP RATIO (SMD=--1.00; 95% CI=--1.44, -0.55; P<0.001). IN STUDIES WITH OVERWEIGHT/OBESE PARTICIPANTS ONLY, EFFECTS RELATIVE TO USUAL CARE WERE FOUND FOR BODY MASS INDEX (SMD=-0.99; 95% CI=-1.67, -0.31; P=0.004). EFFECTS HOWEVER WERE NOT ROBUST AGAINST SELECTION BIAS; AND PUBLICATION BIAS COULD NOT BE RULED OUT. NO INTERVENTION-RELATED ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS: DESPITE METHODOLOGICAL DRAWBACKS, YOGA CAN BE PRELIMINARILY CONSIDERED A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION TO REDUCE BODY MASS INDEX IN OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE INDIVIDUALS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
9 2617  61 YOGA FOR SECONDARY PREVENTION OF CORONARY HEART DISEASE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVES: YOGA HAS BEEN WIDELY PRACTICED AND HAS RECENTLY SHOWN BENEFITS IN PATIENTS WITH CORONARY HEART DISEASE (CHD), HOWEVER, EVIDENCE IS INCONSISTENT. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS BY SEARCHING PUBMED/MEDLINE, THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL), EMBASE AND WEB OF SCIENCE FROM INCEPTION TO MAY 31, 2020 FOR RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) COMPARING YOGA WITH USUAL CARE OR NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH CHD. THE PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY AND HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HR-QOL). SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE A COMPOSITE CARDIOVASCULAR OUTCOME, EXERCISE CAPACITY AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS (BLOOD PRESSURE, LIPID PROFILES AND BODY MASS INDEX). RESULTS: SEVEN RCTS WITH A TOTAL OF 4671 PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED. SIX RCTS COMPARED YOGA WITH USUAL CARE AND ONE COMPARED YOGA WITH DESIGNED EXERCISE. THE MEAN AGE OF THE PARTICIPANTS RANGED FROM 51.0-60.7 YEARS AND THE MAJORITY OF THEM WERE MEN (85.4 %). POOLED RESULTS SHOWED THAT COMPARED WITH USUAL CARE, YOGA HAD NO EFFECT ON ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY (RR, 1.02; 95 % CI, 0.75-1.39), BUT IT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED HR-QOL (SMD, 0.07; 95 % CI, 0.01 - 0.14). A NON-SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF THE COMPOSITE CARDIOVASCULAR OUTCOME WAS OBSERVED (133 VS. 154; RR, 0.63; 95 % CI, 0.15-2.59). SERUM LEVEL OF TRIGLYCERIDE AND HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL, BLOOD PRESSURE AND BODY MASS INDEX WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED. THE STUDY COMPARING YOGA WITH CONTROL EXERCISE ALSO REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER EFFECTS OF YOGA ON HR-QOL (85.75 VS. 75.24, P < 0.001). NO SEVERE ADVERSE EVENTS RELATED TO YOGA WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA MIGHT BE A PROMISING ALTERNATIVE FOR PATIENTS WITH CHD AS IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE, LESS NUMBER OF COMPOSITE CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS, AND IMPROVED CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
10 2491  47 YOGA AS ANTIHYPERTENSIVE LIFESTYLE THERAPY: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA AS ANTIHYPERTENSIVE LIFESTYLE THERAPY AND IDENTIFY MODERATORS THAT ACCOUNT FOR VARIABILITY IN THE BLOOD PRESSURE (BP) RESPONSE TO YOGA. METHODS: WE SYSTEMATICALLY SEARCHED 6 ELECTRONIC DATABASES FROM INCEPTION THROUGH JUNE 4, 2018, FOR ARTICLES PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE JOURNALS ON TRIALS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS THAT INVOLVED ADULT PARTICIPANTS, REPORTED PREINTERVENTION AND POSTINTERVENTION BP, AND HAD A NONEXERCISE/NONDIET CONTROL GROUP. OUR SEARCH YIELDED 49 QUALIFYING CONTROLLED TRIALS (56 INTERVENTIONS). WE (1) EVALUATED THE RISK OF BIAS AND METHODOLOGICAL STUDY QUALITY, (2) PERFORMED META-REGRESSION ANALYSIS FOLLOWING RANDOM-EFFECTS ASSUMPTIONS, AND (3) GENERATED ADDITIVE MODELS THAT REPRESENTED THE LARGEST POSSIBLE CLINICALLY RELEVANT BP REDUCTIONS. RESULTS: ON AVERAGE, THE 3517 TRIAL PARTICIPANTS WERE MIDDLE-AGED (49.2+/-19.5 YEARS), OVERWEIGHT (27.9+/-3.6 KG/M(2)) ADULTS WITH HIGH BP (SYSTOLIC BP, 129.3+/-13.3 MM HG; DIASTOLIC BP, 80.7+/-8.4 MM HG). YOGA WAS PRACTICED 4.8+/-3.4 SESSIONS PER WEEK FOR 59.2+/-25.0 MINUTES PER SESSION FOR 13.2+/-7.5 WEEKS. ON AVERAGE, YOGA ELICITED MODERATE REDUCTIONS IN SYSTOLIC BP (WEIGHTED MEAN EFFECT SIZE, -0.47; 95% CI, -0.62-0.32, -5.0 MM HG) AND DIASTOLIC BP (WEIGHTED MEAN EFFECT SIZE, -0.47; 95% CI, -0.61 TO -0.32; -3.9 MM HG) COMPARED WITH CONTROLS (P<.001 FOR BOTH SYSTOLIC BP AND DIASTOLIC BP). CONTROLLING FOR PUBLICATION BIAS AND METHODOLOGICAL STUDY QUALITY, WHEN YOGA WAS PRACTICED 3 SESSIONS PER WEEK AMONG SAMPLES WITH HYPERTENSION, YOGA INTERVENTIONS THAT INCLUDED BREATHING TECHNIQUES AND MEDITATION/MENTAL RELAXATION ELICITED BP REDUCTIONS OF 11/6 MM HG COMPARED WITH THOSE THAT DID NOT (IE, 6/3 MM HG). CONCLUSION: OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT YOGA IS A VIABLE ANTIHYPERTENSIVE LIFESTYLE THERAPY THAT PRODUCES THE GREATEST BP BENEFITS WHEN BREATHING TECHNIQUES AND MEDITATION/MENTAL RELAXATION ARE INCLUDED.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
11 2171  41 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS AMONG PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM) IS A FASTEST EVOLVING METABOLIC DISORDER AND INDIA HOUSES SECOND HIGHEST NUMBER OF PATIENTS WITH DIABETES AFTER CHINA. CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES ARE THE MAJOR CAUSE OF MORTALITY AMONG PATIENTS WITH T2DM. YOGA IS AN ANCIENT INDIAN PRACTICE THAT PROVES TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR PATIENTS WITH DIABETES. THE PRESENT SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS HAS BEEN CONDUCTED TO SEE THE BENEFITS OF YOGA ON BLOOD PRESSURE, LIPID PROFILE, AND ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASURES AMONG PATIENTS WITH T2DM. THE ARTICLES WERE EXTRACTED FROM THREE DATABASES - PUBMED, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR. ONLY ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTICLES, WITH PEDRO SCORE>/=6, WERE INCLUDED IN THE CURRENT STUDY. THE DUPLICATES WERE REMOVED USING MENDELEY. FOURTEEN RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) AND THREE 3 NON-RCTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. THE META-ANALYSIS WAS DONE USING REVIEW MANAGER 5.3. THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT YOGA IS EFFECT IN IMPROVING BLOOD PRESSURE (P<0.01), LIPID PROFILE (P<0.01) EXCEPT HDL (P=0.06), AND ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASURES (P<0.01) EXCEPT WAIST-HIP RATIO (P=0.79). HETEROGENEITY WAS ALSO HIGH FOR MOST OF THE VARIABLES. IT MAY BE CONCLUDED FROM THE RESULTS THAT THE YOGA IS EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING OF BLOOD PRESSURE, LIPID PROFILE, AND ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASURES. HOWEVER, HIGH HETEROGENEITY SOUGHT THE NEED OF MORE HIGH QUALITY RCTS TO AFFIRM THESE FINDINGS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
12  355  41 ASSOCIATED FACTORS AND CONSEQUENCES OF RISK OF BIAS IN RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS OF YOGA: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. BACKGROUND: BIAS IN RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) OF COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY INTERVENTIONS SEEMS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC FACTORS AND TO POTENTIALLY DISTORT THE STUDIES' CONCLUSIONS. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW ASSESSED ASSOCIATED FACTORS OF RISK OF BIAS AND CONSEQUENCES FOR THE STUDIES' CONCLUSIONS IN RCTS OF YOGA AS ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY USED COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES. METHODS: MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, INDMED AND THE COCHRANE LIBRARY WERE SEARCHED THROUGH FEBRUARY 2014 FOR YOGA RCTS. RISK OF SELECTION BIAS WAS ASSESSED USING THE COCHRANE TOOL AND REGRESSED TO A) PUBLICATION YEAR; B) COUNTRY OF ORIGIN; C) JOURNAL TYPE; AND D) IMPACT FACTOR USING MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS. LIKEWISE, THE AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS WERE REGRESSED TO RISK OF BIAS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 312 RCTS WERE INCLUDED. IMPACT FACTOR RANGED FROM 0.0 TO 39.2 (MEDIAN = 1.3); 60 RCT (19.2%) HAD A LOW RISK OF SELECTION BIAS, AND 252 (80.8%) HAD A HIGH OR UNCLEAR RISK OF SELECTION BIAS. ONLY PUBLICATION YEAR AND IMPACT FACTOR SIGNIFICANTLY PREDICTED LOW RISK OF BIAS; RCTS PUBLISHED AFTER 2001 (ADJUSTED ODDS RATIO (OR) = 12.6; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) = 1.7, 94.0; P<0.001) AND THOSE PUBLISHED IN JOURNALS WITH IMPACT FACTOR (ADJUSTED OR = 2.6; 95%CI = 1.4, 4.9; P = 0.004) WERE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE LOW RISK OF BIAS. THE AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS WERE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH RISK OF BIAS. CONCLUSIONS: RISK OF SELECTION BIAS WAS GENERALLY HIGH IN RCTS OF YOGA; ALTHOUGH THE SITUATION HAS IMPROVED SINCE THE PUBLICATION OF THE REVISED CONSORT STATEMENT 2001. PRE-CONSORT RCTS AND THOSE PUBLISHED IN JOURNALS WITHOUT IMPACT FACTOR SHOULD BE HANDLED WITH INCREASED CARE; ALTHOUGH RISK OF BIAS IS UNLIKELY TO DISTORT THE RCTS' CONCLUSIONS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
13 2098  50 THE EFFECT OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. BACKGROUND: WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER (BC) ARE LIVING LONGER WITH DEBILITATING SIDE EFFECTS SUCH AS CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (CRF) THAT AFFECT OVERALL WELL-BEING. YOGA PROMOTES HEALTH, WELL-BEING AND MAY BE BENEFICIAL IN REDUCING CRF. ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN PREVIOUS SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND META-ANALYSES, THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CRF AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) REMAIN UNCLEAR, PARTICULARLY IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER TYPES OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (PA). OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO CARRY OUT A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CRF AND QOL IN WOMEN WITH BC. METHODS: ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE SEARCHED (MEDLINE, EMBASE CLASSIC+EMBASE AND EMB REVIEWS, COCHRANE CENTRAL CT) FROM INCEPTION TO MAY 2018. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE INCLUDED IF THEY WERE FULL TEXT, IN ENGLISH, INCLUDED A YOGA INTERVENTION, A COMPARATOR (INCLUDING NON-PA USUAL CARE OR ALTERNATE PA INTERVENTION), AND REPORTED ON CRF OR QOL. EFFECTS OF YOGA WERE POOLED USING STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE (SMD) VIA A RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL. RESULTS: OF THE 2468 RECORDS RETRIEVED, 24 TRIALS WERE INCLUDED; 18 STUDIES COMPARED YOGA TO A NON-PA COMPARATOR AND 6 TO A PA COMPARATOR. YOGA DEMONSTRATED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN CRF OVER NON-PA (SMD -0.30 [-0.51; -0.08]) BUT NOT PA (SMD -0.17 [-0.50; 0.17]) COMPARATORS. ADDITIONALLY, YOGA DEMONSTRATED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN QOL OVER NON-PA (SMD -0.27 [-0.46; -0.07]) BUT NOT PA (SMD 0.04 [-0.22; +0.31]) COMPARATORS. DISCUSSION: THIS META-ANALYSIS FOUND THAT YOGA PROVIDES SMALL TO MEDIUM IMPROVEMENTS IN CRF AND QOL COMPARED TO NON-PA, BUT NOT IN COMPARISON TO OTHER PA INTERVENTIONS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
14 2161  45 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AMONG ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS META-ANALYSIS WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA FOR GLYCEMIC CONTROL AMONG ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES (T2DM). COMPREHENSIVE ELECTRONIC DATABASES SEARCHES LOCATED 2559 UNIQUE STUDIES WITH RELEVANT KEY TERMS. STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IF THEY (1) EVALUATED A YOGA INTERVENTION TO PROMOTE T2DM MANAGEMENT, (2) USED A COMPARISON GROUP, (3) REPORTED AN OBJECTIVE MEASURE OF GLYCEMIC CONTROL AT POST-INTERVENTION, AND (4) HAD FOLLOW-UP LENGTH OR POST-TEST OF AT LEAST 8WEEKS FROM BASELINE. INDEPENDENT RATERS CODED PARTICIPANT, DESIGN AND METHODOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND INTERVENTION CONTENT. SUMMARY EFFECT SIZES AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CI) WERE CALCULATED. TWENTY-THREE STUDIES WITH 2473 PARTICIPANTS (MEAN AGE=53YEARS; 43% WOMEN) MET ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA. COMPARED WITH CONTROLS, YOGA PARTICIPANTS WERE SUCCESSFUL IN IMPROVING THEIR HBA1C (D+=0.36, 95% CI=0.16, 0.56; K=16), FBG (D+=0.58, 95% CI=0.40, 0.76; K=20), AND PPBG (D+=0.40, 95% CI=0.23, 0.56; K=14). YOGA WAS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN LIPID PROFILE, BLOOD PRESSURE, BODY MASS INDEX, WAIST/HIP RATIO AND CORTISOL LEVELS. OVERALL, STUDIES SATISFIED AN AVERAGE OF 41% OF THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY (MQ) CRITERIA; MQ SCORE WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH ANY OUTCOME (PS >0.05). YOGA IMPROVED GLYCEMIC OUTCOMES AND OTHER RISK FACTORS FOR COMPLICATIONS IN ADULTS WITH T2DM RELATIVE TO A CONTROL CONDITION. ADDITIONAL STUDIES WITH LONGER FOLLOW-UPS ARE NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE LONG-TERM EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR ADULTS WITH T2DM.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
15  231  41 A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF YOGA FOR HEART DISEASE. BACKGROUND: THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) AIMED TO EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE AND THE STRENGTH OF RECOMMENDATION FOR YOGA AS AN ANCILLARY INTERVENTION FOR HEART DISEASE. METHODS: MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, AND INDMED WERE SEARCHED UP TO OCTOBER 2013. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES WERE MORTALITY, NONFATAL CARDIAC EVENTS, EXERCISE CAPACITY, HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, AND MODIFIABLE CARDIAC RISK FACTORS. RISK OF BIAS, QUALITY OF EVIDENCE, AND THE STRENGTH OF THE RECOMMENDATION FOR OR AGAINST YOGA WERE ASSESSED ACCORDING TO THE COCHRANE COLLABORATION AND GRADE RECOMMENDATIONS. RESULTS: SEVEN RCTS WITH 624 PATIENTS COMPARING YOGA TO USUAL CARE WERE INCLUDED. FOR CORONARY HEART DISEASE (FOUR RCTS), THERE WAS VERY LOW EVIDENCE FOR NO EFFECT ON MORTALITY, FOR A REDUCED NUMBER OF ANGINA EPISODES, AND FOR INCREASED EXERCISE CAPACITY, AND LOW EVIDENCE FOR REDUCED MODIFIABLE CARDIAC RISK FACTORS. FOR HEART FAILURE (TWO RCTS), THERE WAS VERY LOW EVIDENCE FOR NO EFFECT ON MORTALITY, AND LOW EVIDENCE FOR INCREASED EXERCISE CAPACITY, AND FOR NO EFFECT ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE. FOR CARDIAC DYSRHYTHMIAS TREATED WITH IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER-DEFIBRILLATOR (ONE RCT), THERE WAS VERY LOW EVIDENCE FOR NO EFFECT ON MORTALITY, AND FOR IMPROVED QUALITY, AND LOW EVIDENCE FOR EFFECTS ON NONFATAL DEVICE-TREATED VENTRICULAR EVENTS. THREE RCTS REPORTED SAFETY DATA AND REPORTED THAT NO ADVERSE EVENTS OCCURRED. CONCLUSIONS: BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THIS REVIEW, WEAK RECOMMENDATIONS CAN BE MADE FOR THE ANCILLARY USE OF YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH CORONARY HEART DISEASE, HEART FAILURE, AND CARDIAC DYSRHYTHMIA AT THIS POINT.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
16 1270  41 FRAMINGHAM RISK SCORE AND ESTIMATED 10-YEAR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK REDUCTION BY A SHORT-TERM YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF A SHORT-TERM YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION PROGRAM IN LOWERING FRAMINGHAM RISK SCORE (FRS) AND ESTIMATED 10-YEAR CARDIOVASCULAR RISK. METHODS: THIS WAS A SINGLE-ARM, PRE-POST INTERVENTIONAL STUDY INCLUDING DATA FROM A HISTORICAL COHORT WITH LOW TO MODERATE RISK FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (CVD). IT WAS CONDUCTED IN A TERTIARY-CARE HOSPITAL. PARTICIPANTS WITH LOW (0 OR 1 CVD RISK FACTORS) TO MODERATELY HIGH RISK (10-YEAR RISK BETWEEN 10% AND 20% AND TWO OR MORE CVD RISK FACTORS) WERE INCLUDED. PARTICIPANTS WITH PREVIOUSLY DIAGNOSED CVD, DEFINED AS A HISTORY OF MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE, OR CEREBROVASCULAR ACCIDENT, WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE ANALYSIS. HOWEVER, THOSE WITH CONTROLLED HYPERTENSION WERE INCLUDED. INTERVENTION INCLUDED A PRETESTED SHORT-TERM YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION, WHICH INCLUDED ASANAS (PHYSICAL POSTURES), PRANAYAMA (BREATHING EXERCISES), MEDITATION, RELAXATION TECHNIQUES, STRESS MANAGEMENT, GROUP SUPPORT, NUTRITION AWARENESS PROGRAM, AND INDIVIDUALIZED ADVICE. THE INTERVENTION WAS FOR 10 DAYS, SPREAD OVER 2 WEEKS. HOWEVER, PARTICIPANTS WERE ENCOURAGED TO INCLUDE IT IN THEIR DAY-TO-DAY LIFE. OUTCOMES INCLUDED CHANGES IN FRS, AND ESTIMATED 10-YEAR CVD RISK FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 2. A GENDER-BASED SUBGROUP ANALYSIS WAS ALSO DONE, AND CORRELATION BETWEEN CHANGES IN FRS AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS WAS EVALUATED. RESULTS: DATA FOR 554 SUBJECTS WERE SCREENED, AND 386 SUBJECTS (252 FEMALES) WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN FRS (P < 0.001) AND ESTIMATED 10-YEAR CARDIOVASCULAR RISK (P < 0.001) FOLLOWING THE SHORT-TERM YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION. THERE WAS A STRONG POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN REDUCTION IN FRS AND SERUM TOTAL CHOLESTEROL (R = 0.60; P < 0.001). THERE WAS A MODERATE POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN REDUCTION IN FRS AND LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL (R = 0.58; P < 0.001), AND A WEAK BUT POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN REDUCTION IN FRS AND TRIGLYCERIDES (R = 0.26; P </= 0.001), SERUM VERY-LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL (R = 0.29; P < 0.001), AND SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (R = 0.20; P </= 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: THIS YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION PROGRAM SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE CVD RISK, AS SHOWN BY LOWERED FRS AND ESTIMATED 10-YEAR CVD RISK. FURTHER TESTING OF THIS PROMISING INTERVENTION IS WARRANTED IN THE LONG TERM.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
17 2144  47 THE EFFECTS OF MEDITATION, YOGA, AND MINDFULNESS ON DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND STRESS IN TERTIARY EDUCATION STUDENTS: A META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: MEDITATION, YOGA, AND MINDFULNESS ARE POPULAR INTERVENTIONS AT UNIVERSITIES AND TERTIARY EDUCATION INSTITUTES TO IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH. HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS ON DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND STRESS ARE UNCLEAR. THIS STUDY ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MEDITATION, YOGA, AND MINDFULNESS ON SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND STRESS IN TERTIARY EDUCATION STUDENTS. METHODS: WE SEARCHED COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL), PUBMED, PSYCINFO AND IDENTIFIED 11,936 ARTICLES. AFTER RETRIEVING 181 PAPERS FOR FULL-TEXT SCREENING, 24 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE INCLUDED IN THE QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS. WE CONDUCTED A RANDOM-EFFECTS META-ANALYSIS AMONGST 23 STUDIES WITH 1,373 PARTICIPANTS. RESULTS: AT POST-TEST, AFTER EXCLUSION OF OUTLIERS, EFFECT SIZES FOR DEPRESSION, G = 0.42 (95% CI: 0.16-0.69), ANXIETY G = 0.46 (95% CI: 0.34-0.59), STRESS G = 0.42 (95% CI: 0.27-0.57) WERE MODERATE. HETEROGENEITY WAS LOW (I (2) = 6%). WHEN COMPARED TO ACTIVE CONTROL, THE EFFECT DECREASED TO G = 0.13 (95% CI: -0.18-0.43). NO RCT REPORTED ON SAFETY, ONLY TWO STUDIES REPORTED ON ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT, MOST STUDIES HAD A HIGH RISK OF BIAS. CONCLUSIONS: MOST STUDIES WERE OF POOR QUALITY AND RESULTS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION. OVERALL MODERATE EFFECTS WERE FOUND WHICH DECREASED SUBSTANTIALLY WHEN INTERVENTIONS WERE COMPARED TO ACTIVE CONTROL. IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER MEDITATION, YOGA OR MINDFULNESS AFFECT ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OR AFFECT HAVE ANY NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
18 2629  83 YOGA FOR THE PRIMARY PREVENTION OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. BACKGROUND: A SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE AND STRESS ARE MAJOR RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (CVD). SINCE YOGA INVOLVES EXERCISE AND IS THOUGHT TO HELP IN STRESS REDUCTION IT MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY IN THE PRIMARY PREVENTION OF CVD. OBJECTIVES: TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF ANY TYPE OF YOGA ON THE PRIMARY PREVENTION OF CVD. SEARCH METHODS: WE SEARCHED THE FOLLOWING ELECTRONIC DATABASES: THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL) (2013, ISSUE 11) IN THE COCHRANE LIBRARY; MEDLINE (OVID) (1946 TO NOVEMBER WEEK 3 2013); EMBASE CLASSIC + EMBASE (OVID) (1947 TO 2013 WEEK 48); WEB OF SCIENCE (THOMSON REUTERS) (1970 TO 4 DECEMBER 2013); DATABASE OF ABSTRACTS OF REVIEWS OF EFFECTS (DARE), HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT DATABASE AND HEALTH ECONOMICS EVALUATIONS DATABASE (ISSUE 4 OF 4, 2013) IN THE COCHRANE LIBRARY. WE ALSO SEARCHED A NUMBER OF ASIAN DATABASES AND THE ALLIED AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE DATABASE (AMED) (INCEPTION TO DECEMBER 2012). WE SEARCHED TRIAL REGISTERS AND REFERENCE LISTS OF REVIEWS AND ARTICLES, AND APPROACHED EXPERTS IN THE FIELD. WE APPLIED NO LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS. SELECTION CRITERIA: RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS LASTING AT LEAST THREE MONTHS INVOLVING HEALTHY ADULTS OR THOSE AT HIGH RISK OF CVD. TRIALS EXAMINED ANY TYPE OF YOGA AND THE COMPARISON GROUP WAS NO INTERVENTION OR MINIMAL INTERVENTION. OUTCOMES OF INTEREST WERE CLINICAL CVD EVENTS AND MAJOR CVD RISK FACTORS. WE DID NOT INCLUDE ANY TRIALS THAT INVOLVED MULTIFACTORIAL LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS OR WEIGHT LOSS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: TWO AUTHORS INDEPENDENTLY SELECTED TRIALS FOR INCLUSION, EXTRACTED DATA AND ASSESSED THE RISK OF BIAS. MAIN RESULTS: WE IDENTIFIED 11 TRIALS (800 PARTICIPANTS) AND TWO ONGOING STUDIES. STYLE AND DURATION OF YOGA DIFFERED BETWEEN TRIALS. HALF OF THE PARTICIPANTS RECRUITED TO THE STUDIES WERE AT HIGH RISK OF CVD. MOST OF STUDIES WERE AT RISK OF PERFORMANCE BIAS, WITH INADEQUATE DETAILS REPORTED IN MANY OF THEM TO JUDGE THE RISK OF SELECTION BIAS.NO STUDY REPORTED CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY, ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY OR NON-FATAL EVENTS, AND MOST STUDIES WERE SMALL AND SHORT-TERM. THERE WAS SUBSTANTIAL HETEROGENEITY BETWEEN STUDIES MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO COMBINE STUDIES STATISTICALLY FOR SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND TOTAL CHOLESTEROL. YOGA WAS FOUND TO PRODUCE REDUCTIONS IN DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) -2.90 MMHG, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) -4.52 TO -1.28), WHICH WAS STABLE ON SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, TRIGLYCERIDES (MD -0.27 MMOL/L, 95% CI -0.44 TO -0.11) AND HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (HDL) CHOLESTEROL (MD 0.08 MMOL/L, 95% CI 0.02 TO 0.14). HOWEVER, THE CONTRIBUTING STUDIES WERE SMALL, SHORT-TERM AND AT UNCLEAR OR HIGH RISK OF BIAS. THERE WAS NO CLEAR EVIDENCE OF A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS FOR LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (LDL) CHOLESTEROL (MD -0.09 MMOL/L, 95% CI -0.48 TO 0.30), ALTHOUGH THERE WAS MODERATE STATISTICAL HETEROGENEITY. ADVERSE EVENTS, OCCURRENCE OF TYPE 2 DIABETES AND COSTS WERE NOT REPORTED IN ANY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES. QUALITY OF LIFE WAS MEASURED IN THREE TRIALS BUT THE RESULTS WERE INCONCLUSIVE. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: THE LIMITED EVIDENCE COMES FROM SMALL, SHORT-TERM, LOW-QUALITY STUDIES. THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT YOGA HAS FAVOURABLE EFFECTS ON DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE, HDL CHOLESTEROL AND TRIGLYCERIDES, AND UNCERTAIN EFFECTS ON LDL CHOLESTEROL. THESE RESULTS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS EXPLORATORY AND INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION.	2014	

19 2104  55 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON HEALTH-RELATED FITNESS AMONG PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: THERE IS A NEED FOR A TYPE OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THAT COULD ADDRESS THE CHALLENGING CYCLE OF PHYSICAL INACTIVITY, IMPAIRED HEALTH-RELATED FITNESS, AND TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM) CONDITIONS. YOGA COULD BE ONE TYPE OF EXERCISE TO OVERCOME THE BARRIERS TO ADHERE TO REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. THE CURRENT STUDY AIMED TO SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEW THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON HEALTH-RELATED FITNESS, INCLUDING CARDIORESPIRATORY FITNESS, MUSCLE STRENGTH, BODY COMPOSITION, BALANCE, AND FLEXIBILITY, AMONG PATIENTS WITH T2DM. METHODS: WE SYSTEMATICALLY SEARCHED FOUR DATABASES AND TWO REGISTRIES (PUBMED, SCOPUS, COCHRANE, EMBASE, WHO-ITCRP, AND CLINICALTRIALS.GOV) IN SEPTEMBER 2021, FOLLOWING A REGISTERED PROTOCOL ON PROSPERO (CRD42022276225). STUDY INCLUSION CRITERIA WERE T2DM PATIENTS WITH OR WITHOUT COMPLICATION, YOGA INTERVENTION AS A SINGLE COMPONENT OR AS A COMPLEMENT COMPARED TO OTHER KINDS OF EXERCISE OR AN INACTIVE CONTROL, HEALTH-RELATED FITNESS, AND A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL OR QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL WITH CONTROL GROUP DESIGN. THE ROBINS-I TOOL AND ROB 2.0 TOOL WERE USED TO ASSESS THE RISK OF BIAS IN THE INCLUDED STUDIES. A VOTE-COUNTING ANALYSIS AND META-ANALYSIS COMPUTED USING RANDOM EFFECTS' MODELS WERE CONDUCTED. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 10 RECORDS FROM 3 QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL AND 7 RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIALS WITH 815 PARTICIPANTS IN TOTAL WERE INCLUDED. THE META-ANALYSIS FAVORED YOGA GROUPS COMPARED TO INACTIVE CONTROLS IN IMPROVING MUSCLE STRENGTH BY 3.42 (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL 2.42 TO 4.43), REPETITIONS OF CHAIR STAND TEST, AND IMPROVING CARDIORESPIRATORY FITNESS BY 6.6% (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL 0.4 TO 12.8) IMPROVEMENT OF BASELINE FORCED VITAL CAPACITY. THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE FOR BOTH OUTCOMES WAS LOW. CONCLUSION: LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE FAVORED YOGA IN IMPROVING HEALTH-RELATED FITNESS, PARTICULARLY MUSCLE STRENGTH AND CARDIORESPIRATORY FITNESS, AMONG PATIENTS WITH T2DM. FUNDING: ALL AUTHORS IN THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW RECEIVED NO SPECIFIC GRANT FROM ANY FUNDING AGENCY IN THE PUBLIC, COMMERCIAL, OR NOT-FOR-PROFIT SECTORS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
20 1004  45 EFFECTS OF MIND(-)BODY EXERCISES (TAI CHI/YOGA) ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY PARAMETERS AND PERCEIVED STRESS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WITH META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. BACKGROUND: HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) AS AN ACCURATE, NONINVASIVE MEASURE OF THE AUTONOMOUS NERVOUS SYSTEM (ANS) CAN REFLECT MENTAL HEALTH (E.G., STRESS, DEPRESSION, OR ANXIETY). TAI CHI AND YOGA (TAI CHI/YOGA), AS THE MOST WIDELY PRACTICED MIND(-)BODY EXERCISES, HAVE SHOWN POSITIVE OUTCOMES OF MENTAL HEALTH. TO DATE, NO SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGARDING THE LONG-LASTING EFFECTS OF TAI CHI/YOGA ON HRV PARAMETERS AND PERCEIVED STRESS HAS BEEN CONDUCTED. OBJECTIVE: TO CRITICALLY EVALUATE THE EXISTING LITERATURE ON THIS TOPIC. METHODS: FIVE ELECTRONIC DATABASES (WEB OF SCIENCE, PUBMED, SCOPUS, SPORTDISCUS AND COCHRANE LIBRARY) WERE SEARCHED FROM THE START OF THE RESEARCH PROJECT TO JULY 2018. STUDY SELECTION, DATA EXTRACTION, AND STUDY QUALITY ASSESSMENT WERE INDEPENDENTLY CARRIED OUT BY TWO REVIEWERS. THE POTENTIALLY IDENTIFIED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCT) REPORTED THE USEFUL QUANTITATIVE DATA THAT WERE INCLUDED ONLY FOR META-ANALYSIS. RESULTS: META-ANALYSIS OF 17 MEDIUM-TO-HIGH QUALITY RCTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON HRV PARAMETERS (NORMALIZED LOW-FREQUENCY, HEDGE'S G = -0.39, 95% CI -0.39 TO -0.56, P < 0.001, I2 = 11.62%; NORMALIZED HIGH-FREQUENCY, HEDGE'S G = 0.37, 95% CI 0.22 TO -0.52, P < 0.001, I2 = 0%; LOW-FREQUENCY TO HIGH-FREQUENCY RATIO, HEDGE'S G = -0.58, 95% CI -0.81 TO -0.35, P < 0.001, I2 = 53.78%) AND STRESS LEVEL (HEDGE'S G = -0.80, 95% CI -1.17 TO -0.44, P < 0.001, I2 = 68.54%). CONCLUSIONS: STRESS REDUCTION MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO SYMPATHETIC-VAGAL BALANCE MODULATED BY MIND(-)BODY EXERCISES. TAI CHI/YOGA COULD BE AN ALTERNATIVE METHOD FOR STRESS REDUCTION FOR PEOPLE WHO LIVE UNDER HIGH STRESS OR NEGATIVE EMOTIONS.	2018

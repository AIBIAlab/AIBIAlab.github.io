1 1865 139 RANDOMIZED PILOT TRIAL OF YOGA VERSUS STRENGTHENING EXERCISES IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WITH CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE. PURPOSE: FATIGUE IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON AND BOTHERSOME REFRACTORY SYMPTOMS EXPERIENCED BY CANCER SURVIVORS. MINDFUL EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS YOGA IMPROVE CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE; HOWEVER, STUDIES OF YOGA HAVE INCLUDED HETEROGENEOUS SURVIVORSHIP POPULATIONS, AND THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON FATIGUED SURVIVORS REMAINS UNCLEAR. METHODS: WE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED 34 EARLY-STAGE BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WITH CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (>/=4 ON A LIKERT SCALE FROM 1-10) WITHIN 1 YEAR FROM DIAGNOSIS TO A 12-WEEK INTERVENTION OF HOME-BASED YOGA VERSUS STRENGTHENING EXERCISES, BOTH PRESENTED ON A DVD. THE PRIMARY ENDPOINTS WERE FEASIBILITY AND CHANGES IN FATIGUE, AS MEASURED BY THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL FATIGUE SYMPTOM INVENTORY-SHORT FORM (MFSI-SF). SECONDARY ENDPOINT WAS QUALITY OF LIFE, ASSESSED BY THE FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CANCER THERAPIES-BREAST (FACT-B). RESULTS: WE INVITED 401 WOMEN TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY; 78 RESPONDED, AND WE ENROLLED 34. BOTH GROUPS HAD SIGNIFICANT WITHIN-GROUP IMPROVEMENT IN MULTIPLE DOMAINS OF THE FATIGUE AND QUALITY OF LIFE SCORES FROM BASELINE TO POST-INTERVENTION, AND THESE BENEFITS WERE MAINTAINED AT 3 MONTHS POST-INTERVENTION. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS IN FATIGUE OR QUALITY OF LIFE AT ANY ASSESSMENT TIME. SIMILARLY, THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS IN ADHERENCE TO THE EXERCISE INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: BOTH DVD-BASED YOGA AND STRENGTHENING EXERCISES DESIGNED FOR CANCER SURVIVORS MAY BE GOOD OPTIONS TO ADDRESS FATIGUE IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. BOTH HAVE REASONABLE UPTAKE, ARE CONVENIENT AND REPRODUCIBLE, AND MAY BE HELPFUL IN DECREASING FATIGUE AND IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE FIRST YEAR POST-DIAGNOSIS IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WITH CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
2 1052  42 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE AND GLOBAL SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN IN OLDER CANCER SURVIVORS. BACKGROUND: SIXTY PERCENT OF CANCER SURVIVORS ARE 65YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER. CANCER AND ITS TREATMENTS LEAD TO CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE AND MANY OTHER SIDE EFFECTS, IN TURN, CREATING SUBSTANTIAL GLOBAL SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN (TOTAL BURDEN FROM ALL SIDE EFFECTS) WHICH, ULTIMATELY, COMPROMISES FUNCTIONAL INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY OF LIFE. VARIOUS MODES OF EXERCISE, SUCH AS YOGA, REDUCE CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE AND GLOBAL SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN IN YOUNGER CANCER SURVIVORS, BUT NO STUDIES HAVE SPECIFICALLY EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON OLDER CANCER SURVIVORS. OBJECTIVES: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF A 4-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION (YOGA FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: YOCAS(C)(R)) ON OVERALL CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, AND DUE TO ITS MULTIDIMENSIONAL NATURE, THE SUBDOMAINS OF CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (GENERAL, PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, AND MENTAL) AND GLOBAL SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN IN OLDER CANCER SURVIVORS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A SECONDARY ANALYSIS ON DATA FROM A MULTICENTER PHASE III RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL WITH 2 ARMS (STANDARD CARE AND STANDARD CARE PLUS A 4-WEEK YOCAS(C)(R) INTERVENTION). THE SAMPLE FOR THIS SECONDARY ANALYSIS WAS 97 OLDER CANCER SURVIVORS (>/=60YEARS OF AGE), BETWEEN 2MONTHS AND 2YEARS POST-TREATMENT, WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE ORIGINAL TRIAL. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOCAS(C)(R) INTERVENTION ARM REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, PHYSICAL FATIGUE, MENTAL FATIGUE, AND GLOBAL SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN THAN PARTICIPANTS IN THE STANDARD CARE ARM FOLLOWING THE 4-WEEK INTERVENTION PERIOD (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: YOCAS(C)(R) IS AN EFFECTIVE STANDARDIZED YOGA INTERVENTION FOR REDUCING CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, PHYSICAL FATIGUE, MENTAL FATIGUE, AND GLOBAL SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN AMONG OLDER CANCER SURVIVORS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
3 1746  41 PILOT EVALUATION OF AN IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM FOR BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. BACKGROUND: WITH CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENTS IN SCREENING UPTAKE AND ADJUVANT CANCER TREATMENTS, THE NUMBER OF CANADIAN WOMEN SURVIVING BREAST CANCER CONTINUES TO GROW. PRELIMINARY FINDINGS SUGGEST YOGA CAN IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS, BUT FEW STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON IYENGAR YOGA (IY). OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF IY ON QOL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING IN A SELECT SAMPLE OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. METHODS: BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS (N = 24) PARTICIPATING IN IY CLASSES COMPLETED A QUESTIONNAIRE MEASURING GENERIC AND DISEASE-SPECIFIC QOL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING, BEFORE AND AFTER THE 12-WEEK CLASSES. RESULTS: POSTPROGRAM QUESTIONNAIRES WERE COMPLETED BY 17 PARTICIPANTS (71%) WHO ATTENDED AN AVERAGE OF 78.9% OF THE IY SESSIONS. SEVERAL INDICATORS OF GENERIC QOL IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY, INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH (MEAN CHANGE, +4.2; P = .045), VITALITY (MEAN CHANGE, +4.9; P = .033), ROLE-EMOTIONAL (MEAN CHANGE, +6.4; P = .010), AND BODILY PAIN (MEAN CHANGE, +4.4; P = .024). OTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN QOL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING WERE MEANINGFUL BUT WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. FINDINGS WERE FURTHER SUBSTANTIATED BY PARTICIPANT'S EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM'S BENEFITS AND MOTIVATIONAL VALUE. CONCLUSION: IN THIS PILOT STUDY OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS PARTICIPATING IN IY, WE FOUND IMPROVEMENTS IN QOL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING. MOREOVER, POSITIVE PROGRAM EVALUATION AND MOTIVATIONAL PROFILE PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THE ACCEPTABILITY OF IY WITH BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS COMPARING IY TO USUAL CARE AND OTHER FORMS OF YOGA IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS ARE WARRANTED. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: NURSES MAY CONSIDER IY AS A POSSIBLE INTERVENTION STRATEGY TO HELP BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS IMPROVE THEIR QOL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
4 1460  49 INFLUENCE OF YOGA ON CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE AND ON MEDIATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CHANGES IN SLEEP AND CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE: A NATIONWIDE, MULTICENTER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA IN CANCER SURVIVORS. BACKGROUND: CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (CRF) OFTEN CO-OCCURS WITH SLEEP DISTURBANCE AND IS ONE OF THE MOST PERVASIVE TOXICITIES RESULTING FROM CANCER AND ITS TREATMENT. WE AND OTHER INVESTIGATORS HAVE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THAT YOGA THERAPY CAN IMPROVE SLEEP QUALITY IN CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS. NO NATIONWIDE MULTICENTER PHASE III RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) HAS INVESTIGATED WHETHER YOGA THERAPY IMPROVES CRF OR WHETHER IMPROVEMENTS IN SLEEP MEDIATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON CRF. WE EXAMINED THE EFFECT OF A STANDARDIZED, 4-WEEK, YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM (YOGA FOR CANCER SURVIVORS [YOCAS]) ON CRF AND WHETHER YOCAS-INDUCED CHANGES IN SLEEP MEDIATED CHANGES IN CRF AMONG SURVIVORS. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: FOUR HUNDRED TEN CANCER SURVIVORS WERE RECRUITED TO A NATIONWIDE MULTICENTER PHASE III RCT COMPARING THE EFFECT OF YOCAS TO STANDARD SURVIVORSHIP CARE ON CRF AND EXAMINING THE MEDIATING EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN SLEEP, STEMMING FROM YOGA, ON CHANGES IN CRF. CRF WAS ASSESSED BY THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL FATIGUE SYMPTOM INVENTORY. SLEEP WAS ASSESSED VIA THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX. BETWEEN- AND WITHIN-GROUP INTERVENTION EFFECTS ON CRF WERE ASSESSED BY ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE AND 2-TAILED T TEST, RESPECTIVELY. PATH ANALYSIS WAS USED TO EVALUATE MEDIATION. RESULTS: YOCAS PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN CRF COMPARED WITH PARTICIPANTS IN STANDARD SURVIVORSHIP CARE AT POST-INTERVENTION ( P < .01). IMPROVEMENTS IN OVERALL SLEEP QUALITY AND REDUCTIONS IN DAYTIME DYSFUNCTION (EG, EXCESSIVE NAPPING) RESULTING FROM YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY MEDIATED THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON CRF (22% AND 37%, RESPECTIVELY, BOTH P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: YOCAS IS EFFECTIVE FOR TREATING CRF AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS; 22% TO 37% OF THE IMPROVEMENTS IN CRF FROM YOGA THERAPY RESULT FROM IMPROVEMENTS IN SLEEP QUALITY AND DAYTIME DYSFUNCTION. ONCOLOGISTS SHOULD CONSIDER PRESCRIBING YOGA TO CANCER SURVIVORS FOR TREATING CRF AND SLEEP DISTURBANCE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                    
5 2604  48 YOGA FOR PERSISTENT FATIGUE IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE AFFLICTS UP TO 33% OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS, YET THERE ARE NO EMPIRICALLY VALIDATED TREATMENTS FOR THIS SYMPTOM. METHODS: THE AUTHORS CONDUCTED A 2-GROUP RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFICACY OF AN IYENGAR YOGA INTERVENTION FOR BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WITH PERSISTENT POST-TREATMENT FATIGUE. PARTICIPANTS WERE BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WHO HAD COMPLETED CANCER TREATMENTS (OTHER THAN ENDOCRINE THERAPY) AT LEAST 6 MONTHS BEFORE ENROLLMENT, REPORTED SIGNIFICANT CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, AND HAD NO OTHER MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT WOULD ACCOUNT FOR FATIGUE SYMPTOMS OR INTERFERE WITH YOGA PRACTICE. BLOCK RANDOMIZATION WAS USED TO ASSIGN PARTICIPANTS TO A 12-WEEK, IYENGAR-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION OR TO 12 WEEKS OF HEALTH EDUCATION (CONTROL). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS CHANGE IN FATIGUE MEASURED AT BASELINE, IMMEDIATELY POST-TREATMENT, AND 3 MONTHS AFTER TREATMENT COMPLETION. ADDITIONAL OUTCOMES INCLUDED CHANGES IN VIGOR, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, SLEEP, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE. INTENT-TO-TREAT ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED WITH ALL RANDOMIZED PARTICIPANTS USING LINEAR MIXED MODELS. RESULTS: THIRTY-ONE WOMEN WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO YOGA (N = 16) OR HEALTH EDUCATION (N = 15). FATIGUE SEVERITY DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM BASELINE TO POST-TREATMENT AND OVER A 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP IN THE YOGA GROUP RELATIVE TO CONTROLS (P = .032). IN ADDITION, THE YOGA GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN VIGOR RELATIVE TO CONTROLS (P = .011). BOTH GROUPS HAD POSITIVE CHANGES IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND PERCEIVED STRESS (P < .05). NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN SLEEP OR PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE WERE OBSERVED. CONCLUSIONS: A TARGETED YOGA INTERVENTION LED TO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN FATIGUE AND VIGOR AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WITH PERSISTENT FATIGUE SYMPTOMS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
6 1087  42 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY COMPARES THE EFFECTS OF AN INTEGRATED YOGA PROGRAM WITH BRIEF SUPPORTIVE THERAPY ON DISTRESSFUL SYMPTOMS IN BREAST CANCER OUTPATIENTS UNDERGOING ADJUVANT RADIOTHERAPY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: EIGHTY-EIGHT STAGE II AND III BREAST CANCER OUTPATIENTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO RECEIVE YOGA (N = 44) OR BRIEF SUPPORTIVE THERAPY (N = 44) PRIOR TO THEIR RADIOTHERAPY TREATMENT. INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF YOGA SESSIONS LASTING 60 MIN DAILY WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP WAS IMPARTED SUPPORTIVE THERAPY ONCE IN 10 DAYS DURING THE COURSE OF THEIR ADJUVANT RADIOTHERAPY. ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED ROTTERDAM SYMPTOM CHECK LIST AND EUROPEAN ORGANIZATION FOR RESEARCH IN THE TREATMENT OF CANCER-QUALITY OF LIFE (EORTC QOL C30) SYMPTOM SCALE. ASSESSMENTS WERE DONE AT BASELINE AND AFTER 6 WEEKS OF RADIOTHERAPY TREATMENT. RESULTS: A GLM REPEATED-MEASURES ANOVA SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS (P = 0.01), FATIGUE (P = 0.007), INSOMNIA (P = 0.001), AND APPETITE LOSS (P = 0.002) OVER TIME IN THE YOGA GROUP AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE ACTIVITY LEVEL (P = 0.02) IN THE YOGA GROUP AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AND FATIGUE, NAUSEA AND VOMITING, PAIN, DYSPNEA, INSOMNIA, APPETITE LOSS, AND CONSTIPATION. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE ACTIVITY LEVEL AND FATIGUE, NAUSEA AND VOMITING, PAIN, DYSPNEA, INSOMNIA, AND APPETITE LOSS. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS SUGGEST BENEFICIAL EFFECTS WITH YOGA INTERVENTION IN MANAGING CANCER-AND TREATMENT-RELATED SYMPTOMS IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
7 2605  50 YOGA FOR PERSISTENT FATIGUE IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS: RESULTS OF A PILOT STUDY. APPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS EXPERIENCES PERSISTENT FATIGUE FOR MONTHS OR YEARS AFTER SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT COMPLETION. THERE IS A LACK OF EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENTS FOR CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, PARTICULARLY AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS. THIS SINGLE-ARM PILOT STUDY EVALUATED THE FEASIBILITY AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR FATIGUED BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS BASED ON THE IYENGAR TRADITION. IYENGAR YOGA PRESCRIBES SPECIFIC POSES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SPECIFIC MEDICAL PROBLEMS AND CONDITIONS; THIS TRIAL EMPHASIZED POSTURES BELIEVED TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR REDUCING FATIGUE AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS, INCLUDING INVERSIONS AND BACKBENDS PERFORMED WITH THE SUPPORT OF PROPS. TWELVE WOMEN WERE ENROLLED IN THE TRIAL, AND 11 COMPLETED THE FULL 12-WEEK COURSE OF TREATMENT. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN FATIGUE SCORES FROM PRE- TO POST-INTERVENTION THAT WAS MAINTAINED AT THE 3-MONTH POST-INTERVENTION FOLLOWUP. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE ALSO OBSERVED IN MEASURES OF PHYSICAL FUNCTION, DEPRESSED MOOD, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. THESE RESULTS SUPPORT THE ACCEPTABILITY OF THIS INTERVENTION AND SUGGEST THAT IT MAY HAVE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON PERSISTENT POST-TREATMENT FATIGUE. HOWEVER, RESULTS REQUIRE REPLICATION IN A LARGER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
8 1650  46 MULTICENTER, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA FOR SLEEP QUALITY AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS. PURPOSE: THIRTY PERCENT TO 90% OF CANCER SURVIVORS REPORT IMPAIRED SLEEP QUALITY POST-TREATMENT, WHICH CAN BE SEVERE ENOUGH TO INCREASE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS EXERCISE, ARE RECOMMENDED IN CONJUNCTION WITH DRUGS AND COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF IMPAIRED SLEEP. PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT YOGA-A MIND-BODY PRACTICE AND FORM OF EXERCISE-MAY IMPROVE SLEEP AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS. THE PRIMARY AIM OF THIS RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF A STANDARDIZED YOGA INTERVENTION COMPARED WITH STANDARD CARE FOR IMPROVING GLOBAL SLEEP QUALITY (PRIMARY OUTCOME) AMONG POST-TREATMENT CANCER SURVIVORS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: IN ALL, 410 SURVIVORS SUFFERING FROM MODERATE OR GREATER SLEEP DISRUPTION BETWEEN 2 AND 24 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY, CHEMOTHERAPY, AND/OR RADIATION THERAPY WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO STANDARD CARE OR STANDARD CARE PLUS THE 4-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. THE YOGA INTERVENTION USED THE YOGA FOR CANCER SURVIVORS (YOCAS) PROGRAM CONSISTING OF PRANAYAMA (BREATHING EXERCISES), 16 GENTLE HATHA AND RESTORATIVE YOGA ASANAS (POSTURES), AND MEDITATION. PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED TWO 75-MINUTE SESSIONS PER WEEK. SLEEP QUALITY WAS ASSESSED BY USING THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX AND ACTIGRAPHY PRE- AND POSTINTERVENTION. RESULTS: IN ALL, 410 SURVIVORS WERE ACCRUED (96% FEMALE; MEAN AGE, 54 YEARS; 75% HAD BREAST CANCER). YOGA PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN GLOBAL SLEEP QUALITY AND, SECONDARILY, SUBJECTIVE SLEEP QUALITY, DAYTIME DYSFUNCTION, WAKE AFTER SLEEP ONSET, SLEEP EFFICIENCY, AND MEDICATION USE AT POSTINTERVENTION (ALL P </= .05) COMPARED WITH STANDARD CARE PARTICIPANTS. CONCLUSION: YOGA, SPECIFICALLY THE YOCAS PROGRAM, IS A USEFUL TREATMENT FOR IMPROVING SLEEP QUALITY AND REDUCING SLEEP MEDICATION USE AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
9 1036  37 EFFECTS OF YOGA IN MANAGING FATIGUE IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE IS WIDELY PREVALENT IN CANCER PATIENTS AND AFFECTS QUALITY OF LIFE IN ADVANCED CANCER PATIENTS. FATIGUE IS CAUSED DUE TO BOTH PSYCHOLOGIC DISTRESS AND PHYSIOLOGICAL SEQUEL FOLLOWING CANCER PROGRESSION AND ITS TREATMENT. IN THIS STUDY, WE EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGIC INTERVENTION IN MANAGING FATIGUE IN METASTATIC BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. METHODS: NINETY-ONE PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC BREAST CANCER WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE INTEGRATED YOGA PROGRAM (N = 46) OR SUPPORTIVE THERAPY AND EDUCATION (N = 45) OVER A 3-MONTH PERIOD. ASSESSMENTS SUCH AS PERCEIVED STRESS, FATIGUE SYMPTOM INVENTORY, DIURNAL SALIVARY CORTISOL, AND NATURAL KILLER CELL COUNTS WERE CARRIED OUT BEFORE AND AFTER INTERVENTION. ANALYSIS WAS DONE USING AN INTENTION-TO-TREAT APPROACH. POSTMEASURES FOR THE ABOVE OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED USING ANCOVA WITH RESPECTIVE BASELINE MEASURE AS A COVARIATE. RESULTS: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA REDUCES PERCEIVED STRESS (P = 0.001), FATIGUE FREQUENCY (P < 0.001), FATIGUE SEVERITY (P < 0.001), INTERFERENCE (P < 0.001), AND DIURNAL VARIATION (P < 0.001) WHEN COMPARED TO SUPPORTIVE THERAPY. THERE WAS A POSITIVE CORRELATION OF CHANGE IN FATIGUE SEVERITY WITH 9 A.M. SALIVARY CORTISOL LEVELS. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA REDUCES FATIGUE IN ADVANCED BREAST CANCER PATIENTS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
10 2627  25 YOGA FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF CANCER TREATMENT-RELATED TOXICITIES. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: TO (1) EXPLAIN WHAT YOGA IS, (2) SUMMARIZE PUBLISHED LITERATURE ON THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR MANAGING CANCER TREATMENT-RELATED TOXICITIES, (3) PROVIDE CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE USE OF YOGA FOR ONCOLOGY PROFESSIONALS, AND (4) SUGGEST PROMISING AREAS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. RECENT FINDINGS: BASED ON A TOTAL OF 24 PHASE II AND ONE PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS, LOW-INTENSITY FORMS OF YOGA, SPECIFICALLY GENTLE HATHA AND RESTORATIVE, ARE FEASIBLE, SAFE, AND EFFECTIVE FOR TREATING SLEEP DISRUPTION, CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, PSYCHOSOCIAL DISTRESS, AND MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS IN CANCER PATIENTS RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIATION AND CANCER SURVIVORS. CLINICIANS SHOULD CONSIDER PRESCRIBING YOGA FOR THEIR PATIENTS SUFFERING WITH THESE TOXICITIES BY REFERRING THEM TO QUALIFIED YOGA PROFESSIONALS. MORE DEFINITIVE PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE FINDINGS AND TO INVESTIGATE OTHER TYPES, DOSES, AND DELIVERY MODES OF YOGA FOR TREATING CANCER-RELATED TOXICITIES IN PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
11 2442  45 YOGA AND SELF-REPORTED COGNITIVE PROBLEMS IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: CANCER SURVIVORS OFTEN REPORT COGNITIVE PROBLEMS. FURTHERMORE, DECREASES IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TYPICALLY OCCUR OVER THE COURSE OF CANCER TREATMENT. ALTHOUGH PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BENEFITS COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN NONCANCER POPULATIONS, EVIDENCE LINKING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN CANCER SURVIVORS IS LIMITED. IN OUR RECENT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WHO RECEIVED A YOGA INTERVENTION HAD LOWER FATIGUE AND INFLAMMATION FOLLOWING THE TRIAL COMPARED WITH A WAIT LIST CONTROL GROUP. THIS SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF THE PARENT TRIAL ADDRESSED YOGA'S IMPACT ON COGNITIVE COMPLAINTS. METHODS: POSTTREATMENT STAGE 0-IIIA BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS (N = 200) WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 12-WEEK, TWICE-WEEKLY HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION OR A WAIT LIST CONTROL GROUP. PARTICIPANTS REPORTED COGNITIVE COMPLAINTS USING THE BREAST CANCER PREVENTION TRIAL COGNITIVE PROBLEMS SCALE AT BASELINE, IMMEDIATELY POSTINTERVENTION, AND 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: COGNITIVE COMPLAINTS DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN GROUPS IMMEDIATELY POSTINTERVENTION (P = 0.250). HOWEVER, AT 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP, YOGA PARTICIPANTS' BREAST CANCER PREVENTION TRIAL COGNITIVE PROBLEMS SCALE SCORES WERE AN AVERAGE OF 23% LOWER THAN WAIT LIST PARTICIPANTS' SCORES (P = 0.003). THESE GROUP DIFFERENCES IN COGNITIVE COMPLAINTS REMAINED AFTER CONTROLLING FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, FATIGUE, AND SLEEP QUALITY. CONSISTENT WITH THE PRIMARY RESULTS, THOSE WHO PRACTICED YOGA MORE FREQUENTLY REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER COGNITIVE PROBLEMS AT 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP THAN THOSE WHO PRACTICED LESS FREQUENTLY (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA CAN EFFECTIVELY REDUCE BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS' COGNITIVE COMPLAINTS AND PROMPT FURTHER RESEARCH ON MIND-BODY AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY INTERVENTIONS FOR IMPROVING CANCER-RELATED COGNITIVE PROBLEMS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
12 1192  44 EXAMINING A THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS. BACKGROUND: IN THE EARLIER STAGES OF PROSTATE CANCER, EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS HAVE CREATED A NEED FOR RESEARCH TO FOCUS ON PRACTICES THAT MAY IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE THROUGHOUT SURVIVORSHIP. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS A SIGNIFICANT SUPPORTIVE CARE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS, THOUGH THE OPTIMAL MODALITY IS NOT YET UNDERSTOOD. HYPOTHESES: THE AUTHORS HYPOTHESIZED THAT YOGA WOULD BE A FEASIBLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OPTION FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS AND THEIR SUPPORT PERSONS AND THAT THE INCORPORATION OF SOCIAL SUPPORT WOULD INCREASE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ADHERENCE. METHODS: THIS 14-WEEK FEASIBILITY STUDY INVOLVED A 7-WEEK CLASS-BASED YOGA PROGRAM (ADHERENCE PHASE), FOLLOWED BY 7 WEEKS OF SELF-SELECTED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (MAINTENANCE PHASE). DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEHAVIOR, QUALITY OF LIFE, FATIGUE, STRESS, MOOD, AND FITNESS VARIABLES WERE ASSESSED AT 3 TIME POINTS. PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS' PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT WAS RATED DURING YOGA AND AFTER YOGA. RESULTS: CLASS ATTENDANCE WAS 6.1 AND 5.8 FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS (N = 15) AND THEIR SUPPORT PERSONS (N = 10), RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE 7 CLASSES. LEVELS OF PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT WERE HIGHER FOR THOSE WHO BROUGHT A SUPPORT PERSON. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WITH REGARD TO STRESS, FATIGUE, AND MOOD BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA CLASS (ALL PS < .05) WERE REPORTED BY ALL PARTICIPANTS. NO CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE NOTED ON PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVOR'S QUALITY OF LIFE OR FATIGUE OVER THE COURSE OF THE 14-WEEK STUDY. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA IS A FEASIBLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OPTION FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS. THE PROGRAM HAD A PROMISING UPTAKE RATE, HIGH PROGRAM ADHERENCE RATE, AND THERE WERE ACUTE PROGRAM BENEFITS WITH REGARD TO STRESS, FATIGUE, AND MOOD FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS. FUTURE EXAMINATION IS WARRANTED WITH REGARD TO CHRONIC BENEFITS AND GROUP COHESION INFLUENCES ON LEVELS OF PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
13  962  31 EFFECTS OF A YOGA PROGRAM ON CORTISOL RHYTHM AND MOOD STATES IN EARLY BREAST CANCER PATIENTS UNDERGOING ADJUVANT RADIOTHERAPY: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. UNLABELLED: OBJECTIVES. THIS STUDY COMPARES THE EFFECTS OF AN INTEGRATED YOGA PROGRAM WITH BRIEF SUPPORTIVE THERAPY IN BREAST CANCER OUTPATIENTS UNDERGOING ADJUVANT RADIOTHERAPY AT A CANCER CENTER. METHODS: EIGHTY-EIGHT STAGE II AND III BREAST CANCER OUTPATIENTS ARE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO RECEIVE YOGA (N = 44) OR BRIEF SUPPORTIVE THERAPY (N = 44) PRIOR TO RADIOTHERAPY TREATMENT. ASSESSMENTS INCLUDE DIURNAL SALIVARY CORTISOL LEVELS 3 DAYS BEFORE AND AFTER RADIOTHERAPY AND SELF-RATINGS OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND STRESS COLLECTED BEFORE AND AFTER 6 WEEKS OF RADIOTHERAPY. RESULTS: ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE REVEALS SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN ANXIETY (P < .001), DEPRESSION (P = .002), PERCEIVED STRESS (P < .001), 6 A.M. SALIVARY CORTISOL (P = .009), AND POOLED MEAN CORTISOL (P = .03) IN THE YOGA GROUP COMPARED WITH CONTROLS. THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN MORNING SALIVARY CORTISOL LEVEL AND ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. CONCLUSION: YOGA MIGHT HAVE A ROLE IN MANAGING SELF-REPORTED PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AND MODULATING CIRCADIAN PATTERNS OF STRESS HORMONES IN EARLY BREAST CANCER PATIENTS UNDERGOING ADJUVANT RADIOTHERAPY.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
14  929  43 EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY: A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL CONTROLLED STUDY. BACKGROUND: CANCER OF BREAST IS MOST COMMON CANCER AMONG WOMEN IN INDIA AND VAST MAJORITY OF COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE. WHILE UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY FOR CARCINOMA MANAGEMENT, WOMEN ENCOUNTER SIDE EFFECTS, WHICH AFFECTS THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY WITH QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH APPROACH AND TIME SERIES DESIGN WAS CONDUCTED, TO STUDY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA ON QOL OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY. METHODOLOGY: ONE HUNDRED BREAST CANCER PATIENTS SCHEDULED FOR 3-WEEKLY, DAY-CARE ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY (CEF REGIMEN) WERE ENROLLED WITH CONSECUTIVE SAMPLING TECHNIQUE, INTO CONTROL (N = 52) AND EXPERIMENT (N = 48) GROUPS, BY CONCEALED RANDOMIZATION FOLLOWING WRITTEN INFORMED CONSENT. BASELINE DATA ON QOL WERE COLLECTED BEFORE FIRST-CYCLE CHEMOTHERAPY USING THE EUROPEAN ORGANIZATION FOR RESEARCH AND TREATMENT OF CANCER QLQ C30. PATIENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WERE TAUGHT DIAPHRAGMATIC BREATHING TECHNIQUES, SYSTEMATIC RELAXATION, AND ALTERNATE NOSTRIL BREATHING, AND JOINTS AND GLANDS NECK AND SHOULDER EXERCISES WERE INSTRUCTED TO PRACTICE TWICE DAILY AT HOME. THEY WERE SUPERVISED IN PRACTICING THESE TECHNIQUES WHILE THEY RECEIVED SECOND, THIRD, FOURTH, FIFTH, AND SIXTH CYCLES OF CHEMOTHERAPY IN THE DAY-CARE FACILITY. PARTICIPANTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED ONLY ROUTINE CARE. ALL PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED STANDARD POST CHEMOTHERAPY PRESCRIPTION. DATA ON QOL WERE COLLECTED FROM ALL PATIENTS DURING THE SECOND, THIRD, FOURTH, FIFTH, AND SIXTH CYCLES OF CHEMOTHERAPY. RESULTS: THE ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT AT THE BASELINE (FIRST CHEMOTHERAPY CYCLE), BREAST CANCER PATIENTS IN CONTROL AND EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS WERE HOMOGENEOUS IN TERMS OF THEIR SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL VARIABLES AND QOL SCORE. YOGA PRACTICES WERE EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING THE QOL OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP IN THE AREAS OF GLOBAL HEALTH STATUS, PHYSICAL FUNCTION, ROLE FUNCTION, AND EMOTIONAL FUNCTION AND DECREASING THE SYMPTOMS OF FATIGUE, INSOMNIA, LOSS OF APPETITE, AND CONSTIPATION, DURING THE PERIOD OF CHEMOTHERAPY. CONCLUSION: YOGA PRACTICES COMPRISING OF RELAXATION TECHNIQUES REDUCE MANY SIDE EFFECTS AND IMPROVE THE QOL OF WOMEN UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY FOR BREAST CANCER.	2020	

15 1748  41 PILOT RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL OF A DYADIC YOGA PROGRAM FOR GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS. BACKGROUND: WHILE THE USE OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE IN MANAGING GLIOMA PATIENTS' SYMPTOMS IS NOT WELL STUDIED, THE HIGH SYMPTOM BURDEN IN PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS IS WELL ESTABLISHED. WE CONDUCTED A PILOT RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF A DYADIC YOGA (DY) INTERVENTION AS A SUPPORTIVE CARE STRATEGY. METHODS: GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 12-SESSION DY OR WAITLIST CONTROL (WLC) GROUP. PRIOR TO RADIOTHERAPY AND RANDOMIZATION, BOTH GROUPS COMPLETED MEASURES OF CANCER-RELATED SYMPTOMS (MD ANDERSON SYMPTOM INVENTORY-BRAIN TUMOR MODULE), DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (CENTER FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES-DEPRESSION MEASURE), FATIGUE (BRIEF FATIGUE INVENTORY), AND OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL; MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY 36-ITEM SHORT-FORM SURVEY). DYADS WERE REASSESSED AT THE LAST DAY OF RADIOTHERAPY. RESULTS: TWENTY PATIENTS (MEAN AGE: 46 YEARS, 50% FEMALE, 80% WHO GRADE IV AND CAREGIVERS (MEAN AGE: 50 YEARS, 70% FEMALE, 50% SPOUSES) PARTICIPATED IN THE TRIAL. A PRIORI FEASIBILITY CRITERIA WERE MET REGARDING CONSENT (70%), ADHERENCE (88%), AND RETENTION (95%) RATES. CONTROLLING FOR RELEVANT COVARIATES, CHANGE SCORE ANALYSES REVEALED CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS FOR PATIENTS IN THE DY COMPARED WITH THE WLC GROUP FOR OVERALL CANCER SYMPTOM SEVERITY (D = 0.96) AND SYMPTOM INTERFERENCE (D = 0.74), DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (D = 0.71), AND MENTAL QOL (D = 0.69). CAREGIVERS IN THE DY GROUP REPORTED CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (D = 1.12), FATIGUE (D = 0.89), AND MENTAL QOL (D = 0.49) RELATIVE TO THOSE IN THE WLC GROUP. CONCLUSION: A DY INTERVENTION APPEARS TO BE A FEASIBLE AND BENEFICIAL SYMPTOM AND QOL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. AN EFFICACY TRIAL WITH A MORE STRINGENT CONTROL GROUP IS WARRANTED.

16 2654  37 YOGA IMPROVES QUALITY OF LIFE AND BENEFIT FINDING IN WOMEN UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY FOR BREAST CANCER. THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY. SIXTY-ONE WOMEN WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER A YOGA OR A WAIT-LIST GROUP. YOGA CLASSES WERE TAUGHT BIWEEKLY DURING THE 6 WEEKS OF RADIOTHERAPY. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED MEASURES OF QOL, FATIGUE, BENEFIT FINDING (FINDING MEANING IN THE CANCER EXPERIENCE), INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS, SLEEP DISTURBANCES, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, AND ANXIETY BEFORE RADIOTHERAPY AND THEN AGAIN 1 WEEK, 1 MONTH, AND 3 MONTHS AFTER THE END OF RADIOTHERAPY. GENERAL LINEAR MODEL ANALYSES REVEALED THAT COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP, THE YOGA GROUP REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER GENERAL HEALTH PERCEPTION (P = .005) AND PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING SCORES (P = .04) 1 WEEK POSTRADIOTHERAPY; HIGHER LEVELS OF INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS 1 MONTH POSTRADIOTHERAPY (P = .01); AND GREATER BENEFIT FINDING 3 MONTHS POSTRADIOTHERAPY (P = .01). THERE WERE NO OTHER GROUP DIFFERENCES IN OTHER QOL SUBSCALES FOR FATIGUE, DEPRESSION, OR SLEEP SCORES. EXPLORATORY ANALYSES INDICATED THAT INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS 1 MONTH AFTER RADIOTHERAPY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH BENEFIT FINDING 3 MONTHS AFTER RADIOTHERAPY (R = .36, P = .011). OUR RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE YOGA PROGRAM WAS ASSOCIATED WITH STATISTICALLY AND CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN ASPECTS OF QOL.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
17 2093  40 THE EFFECT OF YOCAS(C)(R) YOGA FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS ON HORMONAL THERAPY. UP TO 50% OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS ON AROMATASE INHIBITOR THERAPY REPORT MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS SUCH AS JOINT AND MUSCLE PAIN, SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTING TREATMENT ADHERENCE AND DISCONTINUATION RATES. WE CONDUCTED A SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS OF A NATIONWIDE, MULTI-SITE, PHASE II/III RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED, CLINICAL TRIAL EXAMINING THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR IMPROVING MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS CURRENTLY RECEIVING HORMONE THERAPY (AROMATASE INHIBITORS [AI] OR TAMOXIFEN [TAM]). BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS CURRENTLY RECEIVING AI (N = 95) OR TAM (N = 72) WITH NO PARTICIPATION IN YOGA DURING THE PREVIOUS 3 MONTHS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO 2 ARMS: (1) STANDARD CARE MONITORING AND (2) STANDARD CARE PLUS THE 4-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION (2X/WEEK; 75 MIN/SESSION) AND INCLUDED IN THIS ANALYSIS. THE YOGA INTERVENTION UTILIZED THE UR YOGA FOR CANCER SURVIVORS (YOCAS(C)((R))) PROGRAM CONSISTING OF BREATHING EXERCISES, 18 GENTLE HATHA AND RESTORATIVE YOGA POSTURES, AND MEDITATION. MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS WERE ASSESSED PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION. AT BASELINE, AI USERS REPORTED HIGHER LEVELS OF GENERAL PAIN, MUSCLE ACHES, AND TOTAL PHYSICAL DISCOMFORT THAN TAM USERS (ALL P </= 0.05). AMONG ALL BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS ON HORMONAL THERAPY, PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP DEMONSTRATED GREATER REDUCTIONS IN MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS SUCH AS GENERAL PAIN, MUSCLE ACHES AND TOTAL PHYSICAL DISCOMFORT FROM PRE- TO POST-INTERVENTION THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (ALL P </= 0.05). THE SEVERITY OF MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS WAS HIGHER FOR AI USERS COMPARED TO TAM USERS. AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS ON HORMONE THERAPY, THE BRIEF COMMUNITY-BASED YOCAS(C)(R) INTERVENTION SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED GENERAL PAIN, MUSCLE ACHES, AND PHYSICAL DISCOMFORT.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
18  201  52 A RESTORATIVE YOGA INTERVENTION FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: DATA SHOW THAT YOGA IS EFFECTIVE FOR IMPROVING HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOMES IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. WHILE BREAST CANCER IS THE MOST COMMONLY DIAGNOSED CANCER AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN (AAW), AAW ARE LESS LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN YOGA COMPARED TO OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS. THE GOALS OF THE CURRENT STUDY WERE TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF AN 8-WEEK RESTORATIVE YOGA PROGRAM AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICAN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS (AA BCS). SPECIFICALLY, STUDY AIMS WERE TO (1) MEASURE CHANGES IN STUDY OUTCOMES IN A RESTORATIVE YOGA (RY) GROUP COMPARED TO A WAIT LIST CONTROL GROUP, (2) ASSESS ADHERENCE TO THE RY PROGRAM, AND (3) ASSESS PROGRAM SATISFACTION AMONG STUDY PARTICIPANTS. METHODS: THIRTY-THREE AA BCS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER THE RY INTERVENTION (N = 18) OR WAIT LIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 15). RY CLASSES MET ONCE PER WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS. PRE- AND POST-TESTING ASSESSMENTS WERE MEASURED AT 0 AND 8 WEEKS (IMMEDIATELY POST-INTERVENTION). RESULTS: DEPRESSION SCORES AT FOLLOW-UP WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN THE YOGA GROUP (M = 4.78, SD = 3.56) COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP (M = 6.91, SD = 5.86). NO SIGNIFICANT GROUP DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED FOR SLEEP QUALITY, FATIGUE, OR PERCEIVED STRESS. YOGA PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS COMPLETING BASELINE ASSESSMENTS DEMONSTRATED 61% ADHERENCE TO THE YOGA CLASSES. AVERAGE RATING OF THE YOGA PROGRAM WAS "VERY USEFUL." RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE YOGA PROGRAMS WERE PROVIDED. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT YOGA HAS A BENEFICIAL EFFECT ON DEPRESSION IN AA BCS. THERE IS, HOWEVER, A NEED TO FURTHER EXPLORE THE BENEFITS OF YOGA AMONG MINORITY BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS USING A STUDY WITH LARGER SAMPLE SIZES.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
19 2557  50 YOGA FOR CHRONIC CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY PAIN: A PILOT, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. PURPOSE: TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR CANCER SURVIVORS WITH CHRONIC CIPN PAIN, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF THE INTERVENTION ON PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES. METHODS: CANCER SURVIVORS WITH CHRONIC CIPN PAIN WERE RECRUITED FROM THE BREAST, GASTROINTESTINAL, AND GYNECOLOGICAL ONCOLOGY CENTERS AT DANA-FARBER CANCER INSTITUTE. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED (2:1) TO RECEIVE AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION OR USUAL CARE. AFTER 21/50 OF PARTICIPANTS WERE ENROLLED, THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC REQUIRED THE YOGA INTERVENTION TO BE DELIVERED VIRTUALLY (I.E., ZOOM). PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION, PARTICIPANTS SELF-REPORTED CIPN AND CO-OCCURRING SYMPTOM SEVERITY. ADHERENCE TO THE INTERVENTION WAS DEFINED AS PRACTICING >/= 12 YOGA SESSIONS OVER THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION PERIOD. CHANGES IN PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES BETWEEN GROUPS WERE COMPARED USING WILCOXON'S RANK-SUM TESTS. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS (N = 28 YOGA, N = 16 CONTROL) WERE MAINLY FEMALE (96%) AND DIAGNOSED WITH STAGE III/IV DISEASE (66%). OVERALL, 19/28 (67.8%) OF YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS WERE ADHERENT TO THE YOGA PROTOCOL. YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT WITHIN-GROUP IMPROVEMENTS IN ALL PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES, INCLUDING WORST CIPN PAIN (MEDIAN CHANGE = - 1.7, P < 0.0001) AND SENSORY CIPN (MEDIAN CHANGE = - 14.8, P < 0.0001), BUT ONLY IMPROVEMENTS IN FATIGUE (P = 0.05) AND DEPRESSION (P = 0.04) WERE SIGNIFICANT COMPARED TO THE CONTROL. THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES (P > 0.05) IN CHANGES IN PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES BETWEEN IN-PERSON (N = 6) OR VIRTUAL (N = 15) YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA IS A FEASIBLE NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL MODALITY FOR CANCER SURVIVORS WITH CIPN, BUT MORE INFORMATION IS NEEDED REGARDING ITS IMPACT ON CIPN AND OTHER SYMPTOMS. TRIAL REGISTRATION: CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT03824860 IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: ONCOLOGY CLINICIANS MAY CONSIDER REFERRING CANCER SURVIVORS TO YOGA FOR CHRONIC CIPN PAIN, BUT YOGA CANNOT BE CURRENTLY RECOMMENDED AS AN EFFICACIOUS TREATMENT.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
20 1862  49 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA AMONG A MULTIETHNIC SAMPLE OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS: EFFECTS ON QUALITY OF LIFE. PURPOSE: THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF YOGA, INCLUDING PHYSICAL POSES, BREATHING, AND MEDITATION EXERCISES, ON QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), FATIGUE, DISTRESSED MOOD, AND SPIRITUAL WELL-BEING AMONG A MULTIETHNIC SAMPLE OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-EIGHT PATIENTS (42% AFRICAN AMERICAN, 31% HISPANIC) RECRUITED FROM AN URBAN CANCER CENTER WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED (2:1 RATIO) TO A 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION (N = 84) OR A 12-WEEK WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 44). CHANGES IN QOL (EG, FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CANCER THERAPY) FROM BEFORE RANDOM ASSIGNMENT (T1) TO THE 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP (T3) WERE EXAMINED; PREDICTORS OF ADHERENCE WERE ALSO ASSESSED. NEARLY HALF OF ALL PATIENTS WERE RECEIVING MEDICAL TREATMENT. RESULTS: REGRESSION ANALYSES INDICATED THAT THE CONTROL GROUP HAD A GREATER DECREASE IN SOCIAL WELL-BEING COMPARED WITH THE INTERVENTION GROUP AFTER CONTROLLING FOR BASELINE SOCIAL WELL-BEING AND COVARIATES (P < .0001). SECONDARY ANALYSES OF 71 PATIENTS NOT RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY DURING THE INTERVENTION PERIOD INDICATED FAVORABLE OUTCOMES FOR THE INTERVENTION GROUP COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP IN OVERALL QOL (P < .008), EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING (P < .015), SOCIAL WELL-BEING (P < .004), SPIRITUAL WELL-BEING (P < .009), AND DISTRESSED MOOD (P < .031). SIXTY-NINE PERCENT OF INTERVENTION PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED CLASSES (MEAN NUMBER OF CLASSES ATTENDED BY ACTIVE CLASS PARTICIPANTS = 7.00 +/- 3.80), WITH LOWER ADHERENCE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED FATIGUE (P < .001), RADIOTHERAPY (P < .0001), YOUNGER AGE (P < .008), AND NO ANTIESTROGEN THERAPY (P < .02). CONCLUSION: DESPITE LIMITED ADHERENCE, THIS INTENT-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT YOGA IS ASSOCIATED WITH BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON SOCIAL FUNCTIONING AMONG A MEDICALLY DIVERSE SAMPLE OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. AMONG PATIENTS NOT RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY, YOGA APPEARS TO ENHANCE EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING AND MOOD AND MAY SERVE TO BUFFER DETERIORATION IN BOTH OVERALL AND SPECIFIC DOMAINS OF QOL.	2007

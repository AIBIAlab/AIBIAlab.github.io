1  256 148 A YOGA-BASED PROGRAM DECREASES PHYSICIAN BURNOUT IN NEONATOLOGISTS AND OBSTETRICIANS AT AN ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER. BACKGROUND: NEARLY HALF OF U.S. PEDIATRICIANS HAVE SYMPTOMS OF BURNOUT. THIS PILOT STUDY EXAMINED THE FEASIBILITY OF A 6-WEEK YOGA-BASED PROGRAM (RISE) FOR NEONATOLOGISTS AND OBSTETRICIANS AT BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL AND STUDIED THE EFFECTS ON BURNOUT, PROFESSIONAL FULFILLMENT, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED VIA EMAIL TO PARTICIPATE EITHER IN BOTH PROGRAM AND RESEARCH STUDY, OR EXCLUSIVELY THE PROGRAM. RISE WAS DELIVERED 1 HOUR/WEEK DURING THE WORKDAY FOR 6 CONSECUTIVE WEEKS EITHER IN-PERSON OR REMOTELY; 18 PHYSICIANS PARTICIPATED, 12 COMPLETED POST-PROGRAM, AND 11 COMPLETED 2-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. THE QUESTIONNAIRES ASSESSED BURNOUT AND MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH, PROFESSIONAL FULFILLMENT, WORK EXHAUSTION, INTERPERSONAL DISENGAGEMENT/BURNOUT (PFI), MINDFULNESS (FFMQ), PERCEIVED STRESS (PSS), POSITIVE/NEGATIVE AFFECT (PANAS), RESILIENCE (RS), ANXIETY/DEPRESSION/SLEEP DISTURBANCES (PROMIS), AT BASELINE, POST-PROGRAM, AND 2 MONTHS AFTER RISE. FINDINGS: AVERAGE ATTENDANCE IN-PERSON WAS 2.8 SESSIONS AND REMOTELY 1.4 SESSIONS (4.2/6 SESSIONS). PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATING TOTAL BURNOUT REDUCED FROM 50.0% AT BASELINE TO 9.1% POST-PROGRAM. PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATING PROFESSIONAL FULFILLMENT WERE 8.3% AT BASELINE AND 27.3% POST-PROGRAM. PAIRED SAMPLES T-TESTS REVEALED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN BURNOUT, PROFESSIONAL FULFILLMENT, INTERPERSONAL DISENGAGEMENT, STRESS, RESILIENCE, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION AT POST-PROGRAM COMPARED WITH BASELINE (N = 12, ALL PS < .05). AT 2-MONTH FOLLOW-UP, STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN INTERPERSONAL DISENGAGEMENT, RESILIENCE, AND MINDFULNESS (N = 11, ALL PS < .05) COMPARED WITH BASELINE WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS/APPLICATION TO PRACTICE: RISE IS FEASIBLE WITHIN A WORKDAY AND MAY ADDRESS BURNOUT AND OTHER PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH MEASURES IN PHYSICIANS WITH EFFECTS POTENTIALLY SUSTAINABLE OVER 2 MONTHS. OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH PRACTITIONERS IN HEALTH CARE SHOULD CONSIDER THIS TYPE OF INTERVENTION FOR THEIR WORKERS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
2 1729  42 PERSONALISED YOGA FOR BURNOUT AND TRAUMATIC STRESS IN JUNIOR DOCTORS. OBJECTIVES: JUNIOR DOCTORS ARE FREQUENTLY EXPOSED TO OCCUPATIONAL AND TRAUMATIC STRESS, SOMETIMES WITH TRAGIC CONSEQUENCES. MINDFULNESS-BASED AND FITNESS INTERVENTIONS ARE INCREASINGLY USED TO MITIGATE THIS, BUT HAVE NOT BEEN COMPARED.WE CONDUCTED A RANDOMISED, CONTROLLED PILOT TRIAL TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE INTERVENTIONS IN JUNIOR DOCTORS. METHODS: WE RANDOMISED PARTICIPANTS (N=21) TO WEEKLY 1-HOUR SESSIONS OF PERSONALISED, TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA (N=10), WITH A 4-HOUR WORKSHOP, AND EHEALTH HOMEWORK; OR GROUP-FORMAT FITNESS (N=8) IN AN EXISTING WELLNESS PROGRAMME, MDOK. BURNOUT, TRAUMATIC STRESS AND SUICIDALITY WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE AND 8 WEEKS. RESULTS: BOTH INTERVENTIONS REDUCED BURNOUT, AND YOGA INCREASED COMPASSION SATISFACTION WITHIN GROUP ON THE PROFESSIONAL QUALITY OF LIFE SCALE, WITHOUT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS ON THIS MEASURE.PERSONALISED YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED DEPERSONALISATION (Z=-1.99, P=0.05) COMPARED WITH GROUP FITNESS ON THE MASLACH BURNOUT INVENTORY (MBI-HSS (MP)) AND SHOWED GREATER FLEXIBILITY CHANGES. BOTH INTERVENTIONS INCREASED MBI PERSONAL ACCOMPLISHMENT, WITH NO CHANGES IN OTHER SELF-REPORT PSYCHOLOGICAL OR PHYSIOLOGICAL METRICS, INCLUDING BREATH-COUNTING.PARTICIPANTS DOING ONE-TO-ONE YOGA RATED IT MORE HIGHLY OVERALL (P=0.02) THAN GROUP FITNESS, AND REPORTED IT COMPARATIVELY MORE BENEFICIAL FOR MENTAL (P=0.01) AND PHYSICAL HEALTH (P=0.05). FACE-TO-FACE WEEKLY SESSIONS WERE 100% ATTENDED IN YOGA, BUT ONLY 45% IN FITNESS. CONCLUSION: IN THIS PILOT TRIAL, BOTH YOGA AND FITNESS IMPROVED BURNOUT, BUT TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA REDUCED DEPERSONALISATION IN JUNIOR DOCTORS MORE THAN GROUP-FORMAT FITNESS. ONE-TO-ONE YOGA WAS BETTER ADHERED THAN FITNESS, BUT WAS MORE RESOURCE INTENSIVE. JUNIOR DOCTORS NEED LARGER-SCALE COMPARATIVE RESEARCH OF THE EFFECTIVENESS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF INDIVIDUAL, ORGANISATIONAL AND SYSTEMIC MENTAL HEALTH INTERVENTIONS.

3 1330  36 HOLISTIC NURSING IN PRACTICE: MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION TO MANAGE STRESS AND BURNOUT. PURPOSE: EFFECTS OF A MINDFULNESS-BASED (MB) YOGA PRACTICE ON STRESS, BURNOUT, AND INDICATORS OF WELL-BEING AMONG NURSES AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (HCPS). DESIGN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, 80 HCPS ASSIGNED TO EITHER MB YOGA INTERVENTION OR CONTROL GROUP. METHOD: THE MB YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 41) ATTENDED WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES AND PRACTICED YOGA INDEPENDENTLY. THE CONTROL GROUP (N = 39) DID NOT RECEIVE THE YOGA INTERVENTION. STUDY PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED PRE- AND POSTINTERVENTION QUESTIONNAIRES, INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED (A) PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE; (B) MASLACH BURNOUT INVENTORY; (C) VITALITY SUBSCALE OF THE MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY SHORT FORM-36; (D) GLOBAL SLEEP QUALITY ITEM, (E) MINDFULNESS AWARENESS SURVEY, AND (F) SUBSCALE OF THE BRIEF SERENITY SCALE. DIURNAL SALIVARY CORTISOL AND BLOOD PRESSURE WERE ASSESSED PRE AND POSTINTERVENTION. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS (P < .01) NOTED IN MB YOGA COMPARED WITH CONTROL FOR SELF-REPORTED FACTORS, INCLUDING STRESS (PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE), BURNOUT (MASLACH BURNOUT INVENTORY), VITALITY (MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY SHORT FORM-36), SLEEP (GSQ), SERENITY/INNER HAVEN (IH), AND MINDFULNESS (MINDFULNESS AWARENESS SURVEY). DIURNAL CORTISOL SLOPES AND BLOOD PRESSURE WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED. CONCLUSION: THE MB YOGA INTERVENTION HAD A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF NURSES AND HCPS, MOST SPECIFICALLY FOR MEASURES OF STRESS; PERCEIVED STRESS, BURNOUT, VITALITY, SLEEP QUALITY, SERENITY, AND MINDFULNESS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
4 2519  43 YOGA COMPLEMENTED COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY ON JOB BURNOUT AMONG TEACHERS OF CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: JOB BURNOUT IS A SYNDROME OF REACTION TO CHRONIC JOB-RELATED STRESS WHICH AFFECTS OVERALL HEALTH, LIMITS OCCUPATIONAL EFFICACY, AND PERSONAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF EMPLOYEES THEREBY THWARTING ORGANIZATIONAL OUTCOMES. BURNOUT SYMPTOMS ARE COMMON AMONG TEACHERS OF CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS (ASD) AND AFFECT THE ACADEMIC PROGRESS OF THE CHILDREN. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA-BASED COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (Y-CBT) IN REDUCING OCCUPATIONAL BURNOUT AMONG TEACHERS OF CHILDREN WITH AUTISM IN LAGOS STATES, NIGERIA. METHODS: A GROUP-RANDOMIZED CONTROL-TRIAL WITH IMMEDIATE INTERVENTION AND WAITLIST CONTROL GROUPS WAS DESIGN WAS ADOPTED. PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED 58 TEACHERS OF CHILDREN WITH AUTISM IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SPECIAL SCHOOLS IN THE AREA. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO Y-CBT (N = 29) AND WAITLIST CONTROL (N = 29) GROUPS. THE Y-CBT GROUP PARTICIPATED IN A 2 HOURS Y-CBT PROGRAM WEEKLY FOR 12 WEEKS. THREE INSTRUMENTS DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLE, SINGLE ITEM STRESS QUESTIONNAIRE (SISQ), AND MASLACH BURNOUT INVENTORY-EDUCATORS' SURVEY (MBI-ES) WERE USED TO COLLECT DATA. DATA WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE; POST-TEST AND FOLLOW-UP EVALUATIONS. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING MEANS, STANDARD DEVIATIONS, T TEST STATISTICS, REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE, AND BAR CHARTS. RESULTS: RESULTS REVEALED THAT JOB-BURNOUT REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY AT POST-TEST ASSESSMENT AMONG THE Y-CBT GROUP COMPARED TO THE WAITLISTED GROUP. THE REDUCTION IN THE PARTICIPANT WAS SUSTAINED ACROSS 3MONTHS FOLLOW-UP EVALUATION. CONCLUSION: IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT Y-CBT MODALITIES COULD HELP TO REDUCE THE BURNOUT SYMPTOMS AMONG TEACHERS OF CHILDREN WITH ASD.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
5 1367  33 IMPACT OF A MINDFULNESS-BASED, WORKPLACE GROUP YOGA INTERVENTION ON BURNOUT, SELF-CARE, AND COMPASSION IN HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER A WORKPLACE, GROUP MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION COULD HELP MANAGE BURNOUT AND IMPROVE WELLBEING AMONG HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 43 HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS PARTICIPATED IN 8-WEEK SUPERVISED WORKPLACE, GROUP MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA ACTIVITIES. THE AUTHORS USED A SINGLE-SAMPLE, PRE-POST DESIGN. AT TWO POINTS IN TIME (BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION), PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED A SET OF ONLINE MEASURES ASSESSING BURNOUT, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, STRESS, RESILIENCE, AND COMPASSION. THE AUTHORS USED LINEAR MIXED MODEL ANALYSIS TO ASSESS CHANGES IN OUTCOME MEASURES. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS HAD IMPROVEMENTS AFTER THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION. AT POSTINTERVENTION, THEY HAD SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER SCORES ON PERSONAL ACCOMPLISHMENT, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, STRESS, PERCEIVED RESILIENCE, AND COMPASSION. PARTICIPANTS HAD A POSITIVE PERCEPTION OF THE YOGA INTERVENTION. CONCLUSION: GROUP MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA PROGRAM MAY BE CONVENIENT AND LOW-COST APPROACH TO SUPPORT HEALTH AND WELLBEING AMONG HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
6 2618  31 YOGA FOR SELF-CARE AND BURNOUT PREVENTION AMONG NURSES. THE PROMOTION OF SELF-CARE AND THE PREVENTION OF BURNOUT AMONG NURSES IS A PUBLIC HEALTH PRIORITY. EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE EFFICACY OF YOGA TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES, BUT FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE INFLUENCE OF YOGA ON NURSE-SPECIFIC OUTCOMES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT-LEVEL RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA TO IMPROVE SELF-CARE AND REDUCE BURNOUT AMONG NURSES. COMPARED WITH CONTROLS (N = 20), YOGA PARTICIPANTS (N = 20) REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SELF-CARE AS WELL AS LESS EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION AND DEPERSONALIZATION UPON COMPLETION OF AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. ALTHOUGH THE CONTROL GROUP DEMONSTRATED NO CHANGE THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF THE STUDY, THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SCORES FROM PRE- TO POST-INTERVENTION FOR SELF-CARE (P < .001), MINDFULNESS (P = .028), EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION (P = .008), AND DEPERSONALIZATION (P = .007) OUTCOMES. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE ARE DISCUSSED.	2015

OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF A RESIDENTIAL YOGA-BASED PROGRAM ON PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH AND HEALTH BEHAVIORS IN FRONTLINE PROFESSIONALS. METHODS: FRONTLINE PROFESSIONALS FROM EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE, HUMAN SERVICES, AND CORRECTIONS PARTICIPATED IN THE RISE (RESILIENCE, INTEGRATION, SELF-AWARENESS, ENGAGEMENT) PROGRAM AND COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES AT BASELINE, POST-PROGRAM, AND 2 MONTHS FOLLOWING RISE. RESULTS: PAIRED SAMPLES T TESTS REVEALED IMPROVEMENTS IN MINDFULNESS, STRESS, RESILIENCE, AFFECT, AND SLEEP QUALITY FROM BASELINE TO POST-PROGRAM (ALL PS < 0.001, N = 55), WHICH WERE SUSTAINED AT THE 2-MONTH FOLLOW-UP (ALL PS < 0.01, N = 40). PARTICIPANTS ALSO REPORTED INCREASES IN EXERCISE, FRUIT, AND VEGETABLE CONSUMPTION POST-PROGRAM (ALL PS < 0.001), ALL OF WHICH PERSISTED AT THE 2-MONTH FOLLOW-UP (ALL PS < 0.01) EXCEPT EXERCISE. CONCLUSION: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT RISE IMPROVED INDICES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH AND HEALTHY BEHAVIORS THAT REMAINED 2 MONTHS FOLLOWING RISE.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
8   38  48 A 3-DAY RESIDENTIAL YOGA-BASED PROGRAM IMPROVES EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS' PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH IN A SINGLE ARM TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY EXAMINED CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH IN URBAN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS AFTER ATTENDING A BRIEF YOGA-BASED PROGRAM. METHODS: EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS FROM THE NEW YORK CITY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION (NYC DOE) WHO WERE ATTENDING A RESIDENTIAL 3-DAY YOGA-BASED PROGRAM AT KRIPALU CENTER FOR YOGA & HEALTH WERE RECRUITED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY. MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND HEALTH-RELATED BEHAVIORS WERE COMPLETED BEFORE (BASELINE), AFTER (POST), AND TWO MONTHS AFTER THE PROGRAM (FOLLOW-UP). PAIRED SAMPLES T-TESTS WERE USED TO COMPARE SCORES BETWEEN TIME POINTS. RESULTS: AT POST, PARTICIPANTS (N=74) SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS IN STRESS, RESILIENCE, AFFECT, MINDFULNESS, EMPOWERMENT, SELF-COMPASSION, SATISFACTION WITH LIFE, WORK ENGAGEMENT, BURNOUT, EXERCISE, AND VEGETABLE INTAKE (ALL P VALUES < 0.05) COMPARED TO BASELINE. AT THE FOLLOW-UP (N=33), SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS IN RESILIENCE, AFFECT, MINDFULNESS, EMPOWERMENT, SELF-COMPASSION, WORK ENGAGEMENT, AND BURNOUT (ALL P VALUES < 0.05) COMPARED TO BASELINE. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS BETWEEN THE DEGREE OF HOME PRACTICE OF THE SKILLS AND TECHNIQUES LEARNED IN THE PROGRAM AND IMPROVEMENTS IN MULTIPLE MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AT FOLLOW-UP (ALL P VALUES < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE YOGA-BASED PROGRAM IMPROVES PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND HEALTHY BEHAVIORS IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE PROGRAM AND UP TO TWO-MONTHS FOLLOWING THE PROGRAM, HOWEVER, MORE DATA WITH LARGER SAMPLE SIZES ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM SUSTAINED BENEFITS OVER THE LONGER TERM.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
9 1428  57 IMPROVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING FOLLOWING A BRIEF YOGA-BASED PROGRAM FOR EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS WHO ATTENDED A YOGA-BASED PROGRAM. METHODS: EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS WHO ATTENDED A 3-DAY YOGA-BASED RISE (RESILIENCE, INTEGRATION, SELF-AWARENESS, ENGAGEMENT) PROGRAM WERE RECRUITED TO PARTICIPATE. RISE WAS ADMINISTERED AT THE KRIPALU CENTER FOR YOGA & HEALTH. MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING, AND HEALTH-RELATED BEHAVIORS WERE COMPLETED BEFORE (BASELINE), AFTER (POST), AND 2 MONTHS AFTER RISE (FOLLOW-UP). FORTY-FOUR PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED BASELINE AND POST AND WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. OF THOSE, 33 PARTICIPANTS ALSO COMPLETED THE FOLLOW-UP. PAIRED SAMPLES T TESTS WERE USED TO COMPARE SCORES BETWEEN TIME POINTS. RESULTS: COMPARED TO BASELINE, AT POST, PARTICIPANTS SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS IN PERCEIVED STRESS, MINDFULNESS, EMPOWERMENT, POSITIVE AFFECT, NEGATIVE AFFECT, SELF-COMPASSION, TOTAL WORK ENGAGEMENT, VIGOR, SLEEP QUALITY (ALL P VALUES < .001), RESILIENCE, SATISFACTION WITH LIFE, AS WELL AS EXHAUSTION AND PROFESSIONAL EFFICACY WHICH ARE DIMENSIONS OF BURNOUT (ALL P VALUES < .01). AT THE FOLLOW-UP, SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE MAINTAINED FOR MINDFULNESS, EMPOWERMENT, SELF-COMPASSION, SLEEP QUALITY (ALL P VALUES < .001), RESILIENCE, VIGOR, AND EXHAUSTION (ALL P VALUES < .01) AND POSITIVE AFFECT, SATISFACTION WITH LIFE, AND WORK ENGAGEMENT (ALL P VALUES < .05). CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE YOGA-BASED RISE PROGRAM IMPROVES PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS. IN ADDITION, PARTICIPANTS REPORTED THAT ATTENDING RISE WAS FEASIBLE, THEY COULD CONTINUE USING RISE PRACTICES LONG-TERM, SHARED THEM WITH WORK COLLEAGUES, AND REPORTED THAT RISE POSITIVELY IMPACTED BOTH THEIR DAILY LIVES AND WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT. WITH THESE PROMISING RESULTS, ADDITIONAL CONTROLLED RESEARCH IS WARRANTED.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
10 1255  48 FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND OUTCOMES OF A YOGA-BASED MEDITATION INTERVENTION FOR HOSPICE PROFESSIONALS TO COMBAT BURNOUT. (1) BACKGROUND. THIS RESEARCH EXAMINED THE FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY AND OUTCOMES OF DELIVERING A 6-WEEK YOGA-BASED MEDITATION INTERVENTION TO CLINICAL TEAMS OF HOSPICE PROFESSIONALS (HPS) AT A LARGE NON-PROFIT HOSPICE ORGANIZATION. THE INTERVENTION WAS DESIGNED TO INCREASE MIND-BODY INTEGRATION AND COMBAT BURNOUT. THIS ARTICLE WAS WRITTEN FOR DIFFERENT AUDIENCES, INCLUDING RESEARCH SCIENTISTS WHO STUDY INTEROCEPTION, BURNOUT, MEDITATION, OR YOGA, DESIGNERS OF MEDITATION INTERVENTIONS, AND HOSPICE ORGANIZATIONS LOOKING FOR WAYS TO MITIGATE HP BURNOUT. (2) METHODS. THE INTERVENTION WAS LAUNCHED WITHIN CLINICAL TEAMS, BEGINNING WITH A HALF-HOUR ONLINE INTRODUCTION TO THE PROGRAM AND EXPOSURE TO THE WEEK 1 MEDITATION AT EACH TEAM'S MONTHLY ALL-STAFF MEETING. THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAM, HPS COULD ACCESS THE MEDITATIONS ON THEIR OWN VIA THEIR WORKPLACE COMPUTERS, TABLETS, AND SMARTPHONES. ONLINE PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION SURVEYS WERE SUBMITTED BY 151 HPS, 76 OF WHOM WERE EXPOSED TO THE INTERVENTION AND COMPLETED BOTH SURVEYS. THE SURVEYS ASSESSED BURNOUT USING THE PROFESSIONAL FULFILLMENT INDEX AND MIND-BODY INTEGRATION USING THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL ASSESSMENT OF INTEROCEPTIVE AWARENESS SCALES. (3) RESULTS. TWO-THIRDS OF HPS WHO WERE PRESENT AT A STAFF MEETING WHERE THE PROGRAM WAS INTRODUCED WENT ON TO DO A MEDITATION ON THEIR OWN AT LEAST ONCE. HALF OF HPS EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO CONTINUE WITH ACCESS TO THE MEDITATIONS AFTER THE 6-WEEK PROGRAM ENDED. DUE TO COVID-19 WORK FROM HOME RESTRICTIONS, THREE-FOURTH OF HPS DID A MEDITATION AT HOME, 29% IN A CAR BETWEEN PATIENT VISITS (NOT WHILE DRIVING), AND 23% AT THE OFFICE. HIGHER INTEROCEPTIVE AWARENESS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO LOWER BURNOUT, PARTICULARLY LOWER WORK EXHAUSTION. MEDITATION FREQUENCY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO HIGHER INTEROCEPTIVE AWARENESS BUT NOT TO BURNOUT. INTERPERSONAL DISENGAGEMENT WAS RARE AND TEMPORARY. (4) CONCLUSIONS. FINDINGS SHOWED THAT THE YOGA-BASED MEDITATION INTERVENTION WAS FEASIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE AND ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER INTEROCEPTIVE AWARENESS. THE RESULTS POINT TO A ROLE FOR INTEROCEPTIVE AWARENESS IN REDUCING THE RISK FOR BURNOUT.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
11  130  39 A PRAGMATIC CONTROLLED TRIAL OF A BRIEF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED PROGRAM FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS. OBJECTIVES: TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELLBEING IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS THAT ATTENDED A BRIEF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED PROGRAM. DESIGN: PRAGMATIC CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS THAT ATTENDED A YOGA MINDFULNESS-BASED PROGRAM (N = 9) TO A WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 22). SETTING: THE 3-DAY PROGRAM WAS DELIVERED AT THE KRIPALU CENTER FOR YOGA & HEALTH IN MASSACHUSETTS. INTERVENTION: THE 3-DAY YOGA MINDFULNESS PROGRAM INCLUDED 5 HOURS PER DAY OF YOGA, MINDFULNESS EXERCISES, FORMAL MEDITATION, DIDACTIC, AND EXPERIENTIAL ACTIVITIES. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELLBEING WERE COMPLETED BEFORE (BASELINE), IMMEDIATELY AFTER (POST-PROGRAM), AND TWO MONTHS AFTER THE PROGRAM (FOLLOW-UP). RESULTS: RELATIVE TO CONTROLS (N = 21), THE RISE GROUP (N = 9) SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN POSITIVE AFFECT (P = .033), NEGATIVE AFFECT (P = .044), MINDFULNESS (P = .001), EMPOWERMENT (P = .022), SELF-COMPASSION (P = .001), AND WORK ENGAGEMENT FROM BASELINE TO POST-PROGRAM. FROM BASELINE TO FOLLOW-UP, THE RISE GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN STRESS (P = .008), NEGATIVE AFFECT (P = .013), MINDFULNESS (P = .001), EMPOWERMENT (P = .007), AND SELF-COMPASSION (P = .001) COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: THE YOGA MINDFULNESS PROGRAM WAS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN EDUCATORS' PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELLBEING IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING AND 2-MONTHS FOLLOWING THE PROGRAM. FUTURE RESEARCH WITH A LARGER SAMPLE SIZE IS NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE RESULTS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
12 1174  52 EVALUATION OF A YOGA-BASED MIND-BODY INTERVENTION FOR RESIDENT PHYSICIANS: A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS (MBIS) HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL INTERVENTIONS FOR MITIGATING PHYSICIAN BURNOUT, BUT THERE ARE NO CONTROLLED STUDIES OF YOGA-BASED MBIS IN RESIDENT PHYSICIANS. WE ASSESSED THE FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA-BASED MBI CALLED RISE (RESILIENCE, INTEGRATION, SELF-AWARENESS, ENGAGEMENT) FOR RESIDENTS AMONG MULTIPLE SPECIALTIES AND ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A WAITLIST CONTROLLED RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL OF THE RISE PROGRAM WITH RESIDENTS FROM MULTIPLE SPECIALTY DEPARTMENTS AT THREE ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTERS. THE RISE PROGRAM CONSISTED OF SIX WEEKLY SESSIONS WITH SUGGESTED HOME PRACTICE. FEASIBILITY WAS ASSESSED ACROSS SIX DOMAINS: DEMAND, IMPLEMENTATION, PRACTICALITY, ACCEPTABILITY, ADAPTATION, AND INTEGRATION. SELF-REPORTED MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE, POST-PROGRAM, AND TWO-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: AMONG 2,000 RESIDENTS CONTACTED, 75 WERE ASSESSED FOR ELIGIBILITY AND 56 WERE ENROLLED. FORTY-FOUR PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE STUDY AND WERE INCLUDED IN ANALYSIS. ON AVERAGE, PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED TWO OF SIX SESSIONS. FEASIBILITY OF IN-PERSON ATTENDANCE WAS RATED AS 28.9 (SD 25.6) ON A 100-POINT VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE. PARTICIPANTS RATED FEASIBILITY AS 69.2 (SD 26.0) IF THE PROGRAM WAS OFFERED VIRTUALLY. THOSE WHO RECEIVED RISE REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN MINDFULNESS, STRESS, BURNOUT, AND PHYSICIAN WELL-BEING FROM BASELINE TO POST-PROGRAM, WHICH WERE SUSTAINED AT TWO-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. CONCLUSION: THIS IS THE FIRST CONTROLLED STUDY OF A YOGA-BASED MBI IN RESIDENTS. WHILE THE PROGRAM WAS NOT FEASIBLE AS DELIVERED IN THIS PILOT STUDY, INITIAL ANALYSES SHOWED IMPROVEMENT IN MULTIPLE MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH. RESIDENTS REPORTED THAT VIRTUAL DELIVERY WOULD INCREASE FEASIBILITY.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
13  278  41 ADDRESSING OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY TRAINEE BURNOUT USING A YOGA-BASED WELLNESS INITIATIVE DURING DEDICATED EDUCATION TIME. OBJECTIVE: TO ESTIMATE THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING A YOGA-BASED WELLNESS PROGRAM DURING TRAINING AND ITS INFLUENCE ON BURNOUT, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, STRESS, AND MINDFULNESS AMONG OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY TRAINEES. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A DEPARTMENTAL QUALITY IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVE CONSISTING OF WEEKLY 1-HOUR YOGA CLASSES CONDUCTED DURING PROTECTED EDUCATION TIME AND NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL CHALLENGES FOR 24 OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY RESIDENTS AND FIVE MATERNAL-FETAL MEDICINE FELLOWS. PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED A FREE WRIST-WORN FITNESS TRACKER DEVICE TO RECORD THEIR ACTIVITY. PREPROGRAM AND POSTPROGRAM DATA COLLECTION INCLUDED RESULTS FROM VALIDATED SCALES ON BURNOUT, MINDFULNESS, DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, BLOOD PRESSURE, HEART RATE, AND WEIGHT. WILCOXON SIGNED RANK TESTS WERE USED FOR ANALYSIS. A P-VALUE <.05 WAS CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT. RESULTS: OVER AN 8-WEEK PERIOD, 90% (N=26) OF PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED AT LEAST ONE YOGA CLASS AND 68% ATTENDED AT LEAST 50% OF THE CLASSES. NO PARTICIPANT COMPLETED ALL SESSIONS. EIGHTY PERCENT (N=20) ENGAGED IN AT LEAST ONE NUTRITION CHALLENGE AND 60% (N=15) IN AT LEAST ONE PHYSICAL CHALLENGE. AFTER THE PROGRAM, A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE DEPERSONALIZATION COMPONENT OF BURNOUT (P=.04), ANXIETY (P=.02), AND SYSTOLIC (PREPROGRAM: 122, POSTPROGRAM: 116 MM HG; P=.01) AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (PREPROGRAM: 82, POSTPROGRAM: 76 MM HG; P=.01) OCCURRED. THOSE PARTICIPANTS WHO ATTENDED MORE THAN 50% OF YOGA CLASSES DEMONSTRATED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE COMPARED WITH LESS-FREQUENT ATTENDEES (P=.02 AND .04, RESPECTIVELY). A POSTPROGRAM SURVEY REVEALED FEELINGS OF INCREASED CAMARADERIE, APPRECIATION, MOTIVATION, AND OVERALL TRAINING EXPERIENCE. DISCUSSION: IMPLEMENTING A WELLNESS PROGRAM CONSISTING OF WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES IS FEASIBLE AND MAY BE BENEFICIAL. A WELLNESS INITIATIVE THAT EMPHASIZES ACTIVE PARTICIPATION DURING EDUCATION TIME WITH THE AUTONOMY TO IMPLEMENT DAILY WELLNESS ACTIVITIES MAY REDUCE BURNOUT AND IMPROVE WELL-BEING.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
14 2162  37 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND MINDFUL MEDITATION ON ELDERLY CARE WORKER'S BURNOUT: A CONSORT-COMPLIANT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF MINDFUL MEDITATION AND YOGA ON REDUCING BURNOUT AND STRESS IN CARE WORKERS WHO ASSIST ELDERLY INDIVIDUALS. KNOWING HOW TO REDUCE BURNOUT IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT OF CARE WORKERS IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE QUALITY OF CLIENT CARE, WORKER PRODUCTIVITY, AND JOB TURNOVER. PATIENTS AND METHODS: THE PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED 44 CARE WORKERS WHO WORKED FOR ELDERLY CARE FACILITIES IN RURAL FUKUOKA. THEY WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THREE INTERVENTION GROUPS: CONTROL, YOGA, OR MINDFULNESS. IN THE YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP, A CERTIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTOR TAUGHT A 60-MINUTE YOGA SESSION EACH WEEK FOR SIX WEEKS. IN THE MINDFULNESS GROUP, AN EXPERIENCED MEDICAL DOCTOR INSTRUCTED A MINDFUL MEDITATION PROGRAM FOR THE SAME LENGTH. PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO COMPLETE THE JAPANESE BURNOUT SCALE (JBS), AND THE RESEARCH TEAM COLLECTED THE LEVEL OF ALPHA-AMYLASE IN SALIVA USING NIPRO: T-110-N PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTIONS. RESULTS: MANOVA WAS PERFORMED WITH EACH INTERVENTION (CONTROL, YOGA, MINDFULNESS) AS THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE ON THE THREE SUBSCALES OF THE JBS (EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION, DEPERSONALIZATION, AND PERSONAL ACHIEVEMENT) AND A BIOMARKER OF STRESS LEVEL (ALPHA-AMYLASE). THE RESULTS INDICATED A SIGNIFICANT MAIN EFFECT OF INTERVENTIONS, AND A FOLLOW-UP ANOVA SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF INTERVENTIONS ON EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION AND PERSONAL ACHIEVEMENT. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT PRACTICING MINDFUL MEDITATION OR YOGA FOR 60 MINUTES ONCE A WEEK FOR SIX WEEKS CAN REDUCE CARE WORKERS' BURNOUT. THIS STUDY WAS NOTABLE BECAUSE THE BIOMARKER OF STRESS ALSO IMPROVED. IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED AND ENCOURAGED THAT INSTITUTIONS CARING FOR THE ELDERLY POPULATION PROVIDE MINDFUL MEDITATION OR YOGA INTERVENTION TO REDUCE BURNOUT, WHICH BENEFITS NOT ONLY CARE WORKERS BUT ALSO THEIR CLIENTS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
15 1620  48 MINDFUL2WORK: EFFECTS OF COMBINED PHYSICAL EXERCISE, YOGA, AND MINDFULNESS MEDITATIONS FOR STRESS RELIEVE IN EMPLOYEES. A PROOF OF CONCEPT STUDY. WORK-RELATED STRESS AND ASSOCIATED ILLNESS AND BURNOUT IS RISING IN WESTERN SOCIETY, WITH NOW AS MUCH AS ALMOST A QUARTER OF EUROPEAN AND HALF OF USA'S EMPLOYEES ESTIMATED TO BE AT THE POINT OF BURNOUT. MINDFULNESS MEDITATION, YOGA, AND PHYSICAL EXERCISE HAVE ALL SHOWN BENEFICIAL EFFECTS FOR WORK-RELATED STRESS AND ILLNESS. THIS PROOF OF CONCEPT STUDY ASSESSED THE FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND PRELIMINARY EFFECTS OF THE NEWLY DEVELOPED MINDFUL2WORK TRAINING, A COMBINATION OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE, RESTORATIVE YOGA, AND MINDFULNESS MEDITATIONS, DELIVERED IN SIX WEEKLY GROUP SESSIONS PLUS A FOLLOW-UP SESSION. PARTICIPANTS (N = 26, FOUR MALES), REFERRED BY COMPANY DOCTORS WITH (WORK-RELATED) STRESS AND BURNOUT COMPLAINTS, COMPLETED MEASUREMENTS PRE AND POST THE INTERVENTION, AS WELL AS AT 6-WEEK (FU1) AND 6-MONTH (FU2) FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS SHOWED VERY HIGH FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF THE MINDFUL2WORK TRAINING. THE TRAINING AND TRAINERS WERE RATED WITH AN 8.1 AND 8.4 ON A 1-10 SCALE, RESPECTIVELY, AND TRAINING DROPOUT RATE WAS ZERO. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WITH (VERY) LARGE EFFECT SIZES WERE DEMONSTRATED FOR THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES OF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WORKABILITY, AND FOR ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, STRESS, SLEEP QUALITY, POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECT, WHICH REMAINED (VERY) LARGE AND MOSTLY INCREASED FURTHER OVER TIME. RISK FOR LONG-TERM DROPOUT FROM WORK (CHECKLIST INDIVIDUAL STRENGTH [CIS]) WAS 92 % AT PRE-TEST, REDUCED TO 67 % AT POST-TEST, TO 44 % AT FU1, AND 35 % AT FU2, WHEREAS EMPLOYEES WORKED (RTWI) 65 % OF THEIR CONTRACT HOURS PER WEEK AT PRE-TEST, WHICH INCREASED TO 73 % AT POST-TEST, 81 % AT FU1 AND 93 % AT FU2. INTENSITY OF HOME PRACTICE OR NUMBER OF ATTENDED SESSIONS WERE NOT RELATED TO TRAINING EFFECTS. TO CONCLUDE, THE NEWLY DEVELOPED MINDFUL2WORK TRAINING SEEMS VERY FEASIBLE, AND ACCEPTABLE, AND ALTHOUGH NO CONTROL GROUP WAS INCLUDED, THE LARGE EFFECTS OF MINDFUL2WORK ARE HIGHLY PROMISING.	2017

17 1429  42 IMPROVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING IN A PRAGMATIC CONTROLLED TRIAL OF A YOGA-BASED PROGRAM FOR PROFESSIONALS. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PRAGMATIC CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING IN PROFESSIONALS WHO ATTENDED A YOGA-BASED PROGRAM. SETTING: THE 5-DAY RISE (RESILIENCE, INTEGRATION, SELF-AWARENESS, ENGAGEMENT) PROGRAM WAS DELIVERED AT THE KRIPALU CENTER FOR YOGA & HEALTH. RISE INCLUDED 5 H PER DAY OF YOGA, MEDITATION, LECTURES, AND EXPERIENTIAL ACTIVITIES. SUBJECTS: ADULT PROFESSIONALS FROM EDUCATION, CORRECTIONS, AND SOCIAL SERVICE INSTITUTIONS WERE PRAGMATICALLY ASSIGNED TO THE RISE GROUP (N = 61) OR A WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 60). OUTCOME MEASURES: MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING WERE COMPLETED BEFORE RISE (BASELINE), IMMEDIATELY AFTER RISE (POSTPROGRAM), AND 2 MONTHS AFTER RISE (FOLLOW-UP). ANALYSES OF COVARIANCE WERE CONDUCTED TO COMPARE CHANGE SCORES BETWEEN GROUPS. RESULTS: EIGHTY-TWO PARTICIPANTS (RISE N = 41, CONTROL N = 41) COMPLETED BASELINE AND POSTMEASURES AND WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS, AND 57 (RISE N = 27, CONTROL N = 30) ALSO COMPLETED THE FOLLOW-UP. RELATIVE TO CONTROLS, THE RISE GROUP REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN STRESS (P = 0.001, R(2) = 0.51), RESILIENCE (P = 0.028, R(2) = 0.34), POSITIVE AFFECT (P = 0.001, R(2) = 0.52), NEGATIVE AFFECT (P = 0.001, R(2) = 0.52), MINDFULNESS (P = 0.021, R(2) = 0.13), AND JOB SATISFACTION (P = 0.034, R(2) = 0.08) FROM BASELINE TO POSTPROGRAM. FROM BASELINE TO FOLLOW-UP, COMPARED WITH CONTROLS THE RISE GROUP SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS IN STRESS (P = 0.001, R(2) = 0.33), RESILIENCE (P = 0.001, R(2) = 0.24), POSITIVE AFFECT (P = 0.006, R(2) = 0.49), NEGATIVE AFFECT (P = 0.043, R(2) = 0.32), MINDFULNESS (P = 0.001, R(2) = 0.28), EMPOWERMENT (P = 0.005, R(2) = 0.20), AND SELF-COMPASSION (P = 0.011, R(2) = 0.19). CONCLUSIONS: THE RISE PROGRAM WAS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING IMMEDIATELY AFTER AND 2 MONTHS AFTER THE PROGRAM. FUTURE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE RESULTS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
18  767  31 EFFECT OF TRADITIONAL YOGA, MINDFULNESS-BASED COGNITIVE THERAPY, AND COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY, ON HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL ON PATIENTS ON SICK LEAVE BECAUSE OF BURNOUT. BACKGROUND: TO EXPLORE IF HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE(HRQOL) INCREASED AFTER TRADITIONAL YOGA(TY), MINDFULNESS BASED COGNITIVE THERAPY(MBCT), OR COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY(CBT), IN PATIENTS ON SICK LEAVE BECAUSE OF BURNOUT. METHODS: RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, BLINDED, IN NINETY-FOUR PRIMARY HEALTH CARE PATIENTS, BLOCK RANDOMIZED TO TY, MBCT OR CBT (ACTIVE CONTROL) BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 2007 AND NOVEMBER 2009. PATIENTS WERE LIVING IN THE STOCKHOLM METROPOLITAN AREA, SWEDEN, WERE AGED 18-65 YEARS AND WERE ON 50%-100% SICK LEAVE. A GROUP TREATMENT FOR 20 WEEKS, THREE HOURS PER WEEK, WITH HOMEWORK FOUR HOURS PER WEEK. HRQOL WAS MEASURED BY THE SWED-QUAL QUESTIONNAIRE, COMPRISING 67 ITEMS GROUPED INTO 13 SUBSCALES, EACH WITH A SEPARATE INDEX, AND SCORES FROM 0 (WORSE) TO 100 (BEST). SWED-QUAL COVERS ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING, COGNITIVE FUNCTION, SLEEP, GENERAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL AND SEXUAL FUNCTIONING. STATISTICS: WILCOXON'S RANK SUM AND WILCOXON'S SIGN RANK TESTS, BONETT-PRICE FOR MEDIANS AND CONFIDENCE INTERVALS, AND COHEN'S D. RESULTS: TWENTY-SIX PATIENTS IN THE TY (21 WOMEN), AND 27 PATIENTS IN BOTH THE MBCT (24 WOMEN) AND IN THE CBT (25 WOMEN), WERE ANALYZED. TEN SUBSCALES IN TY AND SEVEN SUBSCALES IN MBCT AND CBT SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS, P < 0.05, IN SEVERAL OF THE MAIN DOMAINS AFFECTED IN BURNOUT, E.G. EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING, PHYSICAL WELL-BEING, COGNITIVE FUNCTION AND SLEEP. THE MEDIAN IMPROVEMENT RANGED FROM 0 TO 27 POINTS IN TY, FROM 4 TO 25 POINTS IN CBT AND FROM 0 TO 25 POINTS IN MBCT. THE EFFECT SIZE WAS MAINLY MEDIUM OR LARGE. COMPARISON OF TREATMENTS SHOWED NO STATISTICAL DIFFERENCES, BUT BETTER EFFECT (SMALL) OF BOTH TY AND MBCT COMPARED TO CBT. WHEN COMPARING THE EFFECT OF TY AND MBCT, BOTH SHOWED A BETTER EFFECT (SMALL) IN TWO SUBSCALES EACH. CONCLUSIONS: A 20 WEEK GROUP TREATMENT WITH TY, CBT OR MBCT HAD EQUAL EFFECTS ON HRQOL, AND PARTICULARLY ON MAIN DOMAINS AFFECTED IN BURNOUT. THIS INDICATES THAT TY, MBCT AND CBT CAN BE USED AS BOTH TREATMENT AND PREVENTION, TO IMPROVE HRQOL IN PATIENTS ON SICK LEAVE BECAUSE OF BURNOUT, REDUCING THE RISK OF FUTURE MORBIDITY.

19 1572  39 MANAGING JOB STRESS AMONG TEACHERS OF CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY WITH YOGA. BACKGROUND: JOB-RELATED STRESS UNDERMINES OCCUPATIONAL, PERSONAL, AND ORGANIZATIONAL OUTCOMES. STRESS SYMPTOMS ARE COMMON AMONG TEACHERS OF CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS AND AFFECT THE ACADEMIC PROGRESS OF THE CHILDREN. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA-BASED COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY IN REDUCING OCCUPATIONAL STRESS AMONG TEACHERS OF CHILDREN WITH AUTISM IN LAGOS STATES, NIGERIA. METHODS: THE CURRENT STUDY ADOPTED A GROUP-RANDOMIZED WAITLIST CONTROL (WLC) TRIAL DESIGN WITH PRE-TEST, POSTTEST, AND FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENTS. PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED 58 TEACHERS OF CHILDREN WITH AUTISM IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SPECIAL SCHOOLS IN LAGOS STATE. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO COMBINED COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY AND YOGA (Y-CBT) (N = 29) AND WLC (N = 29) GROUPS. THE Y-CBT GROUP PARTICIPATED IN A 2 HOURS Y-CBT PROGRAM WEEKLY FOR 12 WEEKS. THREE INSTRUMENTS - DEMOGRAPHIC QUESTIONNAIRE, SINGLE-ITEM STRESS QUESTIONNAIRE, AND TEACHERS' STRESS INVENTORY (TSI) WERE USED TO COLLECT DATA. DATA WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE; POSTTEST AND FOLLOW-UP EVALUATIONS. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING MEANS, STANDARD DEVIATIONS, T TEST STATISTICS, REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE, AND BAR CHARTS. RESULTS: RESULTS REVEALED THAT ALL DIMENSIONS OF JOB STRESS (PERCEPTION OF STRESS SOURCES, STRESS MANIFESTATION, AND TOTAL TSI SCORES) REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY AT POSTTEST AND FOLLOW UP ASSESSMENTS AMONG THE Y-CBT GROUP, COMPARED TO THE WLC. CONCLUSION: IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT Y-CBT MODALITIES COULD HELP TO MINIMIZE THE PERCEPTION OF STRESS SOURCES AND STRESS MANIFESTATION AS WELL AS TOTAL TSI SCORES AMONG TEACHERS OF CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
20 1161  32 EVALUATING A GROUP-BASED YOGA OF STRESS RESILIENCE PROGRAMME: A PRAGMATIC BEFORE-AFTER INTERVENTIONAL STUDY PROTOCOL. INTRODUCTION: RATES OF MENTAL HEALTH ILLNESSES AND BURNOUT ARE INCREASING INTERNATIONALLY. THERAPEUTIC YOGA IS INCREASINGLY USED TO IMPROVE AND MAINTAIN PHYSICAL, MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING AND GENERAL HEALTH. THIS PROTOCOL DESCRIBES A STUDY TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AN EXISTING PRIMARY CARE GROUP-BASED THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAMME, THE YOGA OF STRESS RESILIENCE PROGRAMME, WHICH COMBINES YOGA AND PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC TECHNIQUES, IN IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH AND DECREASING BURNOUT. IMPLEMENTATION FACTORS WILL ALSO BE EVALUATED FOR POTENTIAL SCALE-UP. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A PRAGMATIC BEFORE-AFTER INTERVENTIONAL TRIAL DESIGN WILL BE USED TO STUDY CHANGES IN OCCUPATIONAL PARTICIPATION AND MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES, INCLUDING ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, BURNOUT, FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT, INSOMNIA, PERCEIVED STRESS, LONELINESS, SELF-COMPASSION AND READINESS FOR CHANGE IN ADULTS EXPERIENCING ANXIETY AND BURNOUT. REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE WILL BE USED TO DETERMINE CHANGES IN OUTCOME MEASURES OVER TIME. REGRESSION AND MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES WILL BE CONDUCTED TO EXAMINE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PARTICIPANT CHARACTERISTICS AND OUTCOMES AND AMONG VARIOUS OUTCOMES.

1 2283 202 THE USE OF INTEGRATIVE THERAPY BASED ON YOGA AND AYURVEDA IN THE TREATMENT OF A HIGH-RISK CASE OF COVID-19/SARS-COV-2 WITH MULTIPLE COMORBIDITIES: A CASE REPORT. BACKGROUND: WE REPORT A HIGH-RISK CASE OF A CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 19 (COVID-19)-POSITIVE PATIENT WITH COMORBIDITIES INCLUDING DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), HYPERTENSION (HTN), HYPOTHYROIDISM AND CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (CKD), TREATED SUCCESSFULLY USING AN INTEGRATIVE THERAPY PLAN BASED ON AYURVEDA AND YOGA, ALONG WITH GOVERNMENT-MANDATED COMPULSORY MODERN WESTERN MEDICINE (MWM) TREATMENT. RECENTLY, SOME EVIDENCE HAS BEEN EMERGING ON THE USE OF AYURVEDA FOR TREATMENT OF COVID-19. THE CLASSICAL TEXTS OF AYURVEDIC MEDICINE SUCH AS CHARAKA SAMHITA AND SUSHRUTA SAMHITA CONTAIN DESCRIPTIONS OF PANDEMICS OF SIMILAR PROPORTIONS AND DESCRIBE THEM AS JANAPADODDHVANSA, MEANING THE DESTRUCTION OF COMMUNITIES, ALONG WITH THEIR CAUSES AND TREATMENT. CASE PRESENTATION: THE CASE REPORTED HEREIN IS A 55-YEAR-OLD MAN FROM DELHI, INDIA, WITH CONFIRMED (TESTED) COVID-19, WHO FIRST TOOK MWM FOR 7 DAYS BEFORE SEEKING INTEGRATIVE THERAPY. THE PATIENT HAS COMORBIDITIES INCLUDING DM, HTN, HYPOTHYROIDISM AND CKD AND HAD DEVELOPED SYMPTOMS INCLUDING FEVER (WHICH WAS RESOLVED BY THE TIME INTEGRATIVE THERAPY WAS STARTED), SORE THROAT, DRY COUGH, BODY ACHES, WEAKNESS, BAD TASTE AND SMELL, AND HEAVINESS IN THE ABDOMEN. BASED ON THE PATIENT'S SYMPTOMS AND COMORBIDITIES, A TREATMENT PLAN INCLUDING AYURVEDIC MEDICINES, YOGA PROTOCOL, DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS AND LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS WAS PRESCRIBED BY A REGISTERED AYURVEDA DOCTOR AND A YOGA CONSULTANT. THE PATIENT STARTED EXPERIENCING IMPROVEMENT IN ALL THE SYMPTOMS WITHIN 2 DAYS AFTER STARTING THE TREATMENT; HE REPORTED APPROXIMATELY [FORMULA: SEE TEXT] RELIEF FROM THE SYMPTOMS AFTER 5 DAYS, AND ALMOST COMPLETE RELIEF WITHIN 9 DAYS. ALSO, THE BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS (BOTH FASTING BLOOD SUGAR [FBS] AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD SUGAR [PPBS]) EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT AFTER 5 DAYS, AND DECREASED TO WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE WITHIN 12 DAYS. BESIDES RELIEF IN SYMPTOMS, THE PATIENT'S REAL-TIME REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (RT-PCR) TEST DONE ON THE 19TH DAY RETURNED NEGATIVE RESULTS. CONCLUSIONS: INTEGRATIVE THERAPY WAS FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE IN MITIGATING THE SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19 IN THIS PATIENT WITH MULTIPLE COMORBIDITIES. MOREOVER, A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS (NOT UNDER CONTROL WITH MODERN MEDICINE) WAS ALSO ACHIEVED. INTEGRATIVE THERAPY BASED ON THE CLASSICAL TEXTS OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA MAY OFFER A PROMISING AND SCALABLE TREATMENT OPTION FOR COVID-19 PATIENTS. A CASE SERIES OR A SUITABLY DESIGNED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IS NEEDED TO ASSESS ITS EFFICACY.	2021	

2  373  41 AYURVEDA AND YOGA IN CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES. AYURVEDA IS DERIVED FROM 2 SANSKRIT WORDS, NAMELY, "AYUS" AND "VEDA," MEANING LIFE AND KNOWLEDGE, RESPECTIVELY. IT LITERALLY MEANS SCIENCE OF LIFE. AYURVEDA, OF WHICH YOGA IS AN INTEGRAL PART, IS WIDELY PRACTICED IN INDIA AND IS GAINING ACCEPTANCE IN MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. IT IS A COMPREHENSIVE AND A HOLISTIC SYSTEM, THE FOCUS OF WHICH IS ON THE BODY, MIND, AND CONSCIOUSNESS. THE AYURVEDIC TREATMENT CONSISTS OF THE USE HERBAL PREPARATIONS, DIET, YOGA, MEDITATION, AND OTHER PRACTICES. BASED ON THE REVIEW OF AVAILABLE STUDIES, THE EVIDENCE IS NOT CONVINCING THAT ANY AYURVEDIC HERBAL TREATMENT IS EFFECTIVE IN THE TREATMENT OF HEART DISEASE OR HYPERTENSION. HOWEVER, THE USE OF CERTAIN SPICES AND HERBS SUCH AS GARLIC AND TURMERIC IN AN OVERALL HEALTHY DIET IS APPROPRIATE. MANY HERBS USED BY AYURVEDIC PRACTITIONERS SHOW PROMISE AND COULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR LARGER RANDOMIZED TRIALS. YOGA, AN INTEGRAL PART OF AYURVEDA, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE USEFUL TO PATIENTS WITH HEART DISEASE AND HYPERTENSION. YOGA REDUCES ANXIETY, PROMOTES WELL-BEING, AND IMPROVES QUALITY OF LIFE. ITS SAFETY PROFILE IS EXCELLENT. ITS USE AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPEUTIC REGIMEN UNDER MEDICAL SUPERVISION IS APPROPRIATE AND COULD BE WORTH CONSIDERING.	2005	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
3  689  47 EFFECT OF AYURVEDA INTERVENTION, LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AND YOGA IN PREDIABETIC AND TYPE 2 DIABETES UNDER THE NATIONAL PROGRAMME FOR PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF CANCER, DIABETES, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES AND STROKE (NPCDCS)-AYUSH INTEGRATION PROJECT. BACKGROUND: TYPE 2 DIABETES IS A LIFESTYLE-RELATED DISORDER THAT AFFECTS AROUND 422 MILLION INDIVIDUALS IN INDIA. INTEGRATION OF AYUSH (AYURVEDA) WITH THE NATIONAL PROGRAMME FOR PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF CANCER, DIABETES, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES AND STROKE (NPCDCS) WAS CONCEIVED ON PILOT BASIS AT GAYA, BIHAR, TO PROVIDE INTEGRATIVE TREATMENT FOR NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASE PATIENTS AND TO MANAGE THE BURDEN OF NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES IN INDIA. OBJECTIVES: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ANALYZE THE EFFECT OF AYURVEDA INTERVENTION, LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AND YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES UNDER NPCDCS-AYUSH INTEGRATION PROJECT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A MULTI-CENTRIC, OPEN-LABELED, PROSPECTIVE, COMPARATIVE CLINICAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT 17 COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS AND 1 DISTRICT HOSPITAL. POPULATION OVER 30 YEARS OF AGE WAS SCREENED AND PREDIABETIC OR TYPE 2 DIABETIC INDIVIDUALS WERE ENROLLED IN TWO COHORTS, I.E., PRE-DIABETIC (COHORT A) AND TYPE 2 DIABETIC (COHORT B). EACH COHORT WAS FURTHER DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: GROUP A1 WAS ADVISED FOR LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AND YOGA AND GROUP A2 WAS GIVEN AYURVEDA MEDICATION IN ADDITION TO LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AND YOGA. SIMILARLY, GROUP B1 WAS ADVISED FOR LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AND YOGA ALONG WITH ALLOPATHIC MEDICATION AND GROUP B2 WAS GIVEN AYURVEDA MEDICATION, I.E., MAMAJJAKA, AMALAKI AND GUDUCHI POWDER IN ADDITION TO LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AND YOGA ALONG WITH ALLOPATHIC MEDICATION. TREATMENT WAS GIVEN FOR 6 MONTHS. DATA WERE ANALYZED THROUGH PAIRED T-TEST. RESULTS: A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION WAS OBSERVED IN FASTING BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL IN GROUPS A2 AND B2 (P = 0.001) AND ALSO IN THE POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL IN GROUPS A2 AND B2 (P = 0.001). FURTHER, IMPROVEMENT IN SUBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS SUCH AS POLYURIA, POLYDIPSIA, POLYPHAGIA, BLURRED VISION AND WEAKNESS WAS FOUND IN ALL THE GROUPS, WHILE NON-HEALING ULCER DOES NOT SHOW ANY IMPROVEMENT. CONCLUSION: THE STUDY REVEALS THAT AYURVEDA INTERVENTION, I.E., MAMAJJAKA CHURNA (1 G), AMALAKI CHURNA (3 G) AND GUDUCHI CHURNA (3 G) TWO TIMES A DAY EFFECTIVELY CONTROLS BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL IN PRE-DIABETIC AND TYPE 2 DIABETIC PATIENTS AND IMPROVES THE DISEASE MANAGEMENT WITH LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AND YOGASANA AS WELL AS WITH ALLOPATHIC TREATMENT.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                       
4 1568  21 MAINSTREAMING OF AYURVEDA, YOGA, NATUROPATHY, UNANI, SIDDHA, AND HOMEOPATHY WITH THE HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN INDIA. INDIA HAS A POPULATION OF 1.21 BILLION PEOPLE AND THERE IS A HIGH DEGREE OF SOCIO-CULTURAL, LINGUISTIC, AND DEMOGRAPHIC HETEROGENEITY. THERE IS A LIMITED NUMBER OF HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS, ESPECIALLY DOCTORS, PER HEAD OF POPULATION. THE NATIONAL RURAL HEALTH MISSION HAS DECIDED TO MAINSTREAM THE AYURVEDA, YOGA, NATUROPATHY, UNANI, SIDDHA, AND HOMEOPATHY (AYUSH) SYSTEM OF INDIGENOUS MEDICINE TO HELP MEET THE CHALLENGE OF THIS SHORTAGE OF HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS AND TO STRENGTHEN THE DELIVERY SYSTEM OF THE HEALTH CARE SERVICE. MULTIPLE INTERVENTIONS HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED TO ENSURE A SYSTEMATIC MERGER; HOWEVER, THE ANTICIPATED RESULTS HAVE NOT BEEN ACHIEVED AS A RESULT OF MULTIPLE CHALLENGES AND BARRIERS. TO ENSURE THE ACCESSIBILITY AND AVAILABILITY OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO ALL, POLICY-MAKERS NEED TO IMPLEMENT STRATEGIES TO FACILITATE THE MAINSTREAMING OF THE AYUSH SYSTEM AND TO SUPPORT THIS SYSTEM WITH STRINGENT MONITORING MECHANISMS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
5 1911  28 ROLE OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE IN THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC - A NARRATIVE REVIEW. THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS POSED AN IMMENSE CHALLENGE TO HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS AROUND THE GLOBE IN TERMS OF LIMITED HEALTH CARE FACILITIES AND PROVEN MEDICAL THERAPEUTICS TO ADDRESS THE SYMPTOMS OF THE INFECTION. THE CURRENT HEALTH CARE STRATEGIES ARE PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON EITHER THE PATHOGEN OR THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS. HOWEVER, EFFORTS TOWARDS STRENGTHENING THE HOST IMMUNITY ARE IMPORTANT FROM PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF INFECTION AND DOWNREGULATE THE POTENCY OF THE INFECTIOUS AGENT. WHILE A VACCINE CAN INDUCE SPECIFIC IMMUNITY IN THE HOST, NON-SPECIFIC WAYS OF IMPROVING OVERALL HOST IMMUNITY ARE NEEDED AS WELL. THIS SCENARIO HAS PAVED THE WAY FOR THE USE OF TRADITIONAL INDIAN THERAPIES SUCH AS AYURVEDA AND YOGA. THIS REVIEW AIMS AT COLLATING AVAILABLE EVIDENCE ON AYURVEDA, YOGA, AND COVID-19. FURTHER, IT DRAWS INFERENCES FROM RECENT STUDIES ON YOGA AND AYURVEDA ON IMMUNITY, RESPIRATORY HEALTH, AND MENTAL HEALTH RESPECTIVELY TO APPROXIMATE ITS PROBABLE ROLE IN PROPHYLAXIS AND AS AN ADD-ON MANAGEMENT OPTION FOR THE CURRENT PANDEMIC.	2022

LIFELONG MEDICATIONS ARE REQUIRED FOR SYMPTOMATIC RELIEF IN ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS (AS). WE REPORT THE POTENTIAL OF AN INTEGRATIVE APPROACH IN REDUCING DEPENDENCE ON STEROIDS AND PAIN MEDICATIONS IN CHRONIC AS. A 59-YEAR-OLD HLA-B27 POSITIVE MALE PATIENT SUFFERING FROM AS FOR 40 YEARS SOUGHT AYURVEDIC TREATMENT FOR RELAPSE OF PAIN, STIFFNESS, FATIGUE, INTERMITTENT CONSTIPATION AND DISTURBED SLEEP. AYURVEDIC DIAGNOSIS WAS AMAVATA (A CLINICAL CONDITION CHARACTERISED BY JOINT INFLAMMATION) THE PATIENT WAS MANAGED AS OUTPATIENT FOR ELEVEN DAYS AND HOSPITALISED FOR THIRTY THREE DAYS. INTERNAL MEDICINES AND EXTERNAL THERAPIES WITH DIET MODIFICATION, LIFESTYLE ADJUSTMENTS, COUNSELLING, YOGA AND IAM TECHNIQUE (INTEGRATED AMRITA MEDITATION TECHNIQUE ) WERE ADMINISTERED DURING THE HOSPITAL STAY. AT YEARLY FOLLOW UP, C-REACTIVE PROTEIN WAS REDUCED TO 15.7 MG/L FROM THE BASELINE VALUE OF 37.5 MG/L, AND ESR FROM 103 MM/H TO 8 MM/H INDICATING REDUCTION IN INFLAMMATION. THE DOSE OF NSAID AND DMARD (DISEASE MODIFYING ANTIRHEUMATIC DRUG) COULD BE REDUCED FROM ONCE IN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS TO ONCE IN EIGHTY-FOUR HOURS AND STEROIDS FROM TWICE DAILY TO ONCE IN A WEEK. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PAIN AND STIFFNESS.

9 2885  51 YOGA: AS AN ADJUNCT THERAPY TO TRIM DOWN THE AYURVEDIC DRUG REQUIREMENT IN NON INSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS. INTRODUCTION: IN SPITE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF DRUGS SHOWING ANTI-HYPERGLYCEMIC ACTIVITIES, NONE OF THEM HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN COMPLETE MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES MELLITUS (DM). YOGA AND AYURVEDA ARE THE TWO SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT IN INDIA, WHICH HAVE A HISTORY OF CURING DISEASES SINCE THOUSANDS OF YEARS. YOGIC TECHNIQUES AND AYURVEDIC HERBS HAVE PROVEN THEIR ANTI-DIABETIC POTENTIAL WITHOUT INDUCING UNTOWARD EFFECTS. THE PRESENT STUDY COMBINES AYURVEDIC MEDICATION WITH YOGA TECHNIQUES AS A NEW APPROACH TOWARD HEALING DM. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF NON INSULIN-DEPENDENT DM (NIDDM) AND TO DECREASE THE ORAL DRUG DOSE REQUIREMENT OF GUDUCI GHANA TABLET. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIRTY KNOWN NIDDM PATIENTS OF BOTH GENDERS, WHO WERE ON GUDUCI GHANA (SOLIDIFIED AQUEOUS EXTRACT OF TINOSPORA CORDIFOLIA (WILLD.) MIERS.) TABLETS FROM PAST 2 MONTHS AS AYURVEDIC REMEDY FOR DM WERE SELECTED. ALONG WITH GUDUCI GHANA ADMINISTRATION, THE SUBJECTS WERE INSTRUCTED TO FOLLOW YOGIC PROCEDURES INCLUDING ASANAS, PRANAYAMA, AND SUDDHI KRIYAS. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED FOR 8 WEEKS, WHEREIN FASTING BLOOD SUGAR (FBS) AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD SUGAR (PPBS) LEVELS ALONG WITH RELIEF IN SIGN AND SYMPTOMS WERE ASSESSED AT EVERY 2 WEEKS INTERVALS, AND ACCORDING TO RELIEF IN SIGN AND SYMPTOMS, TAPERING OF DRUG DOSAGE WAS CARRIED OUT. THE OBTAINED DATA WERE ANALYZED STATISTICALLY BY APPLYING PAIRED T-TEST. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS OBTAINED WERE PROMISING AS THE RELIEF IN DIABETIC SYMPTOMATOLOGY WAS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT IN TERMS OF P VALUE. 80.83% REDUCTION IN DOSE OF GUDUCI GHANA TABLETS AND 7.85% AND 8.78% FALL IN FBS AND PPBS LEVELS, RESPECTIVELY, AFTER THE COMPLETE COURSE OF TREATMENT. THE OBTAINED P VALUE SHOWED HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT RESULTS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
10  775  37 EFFECT OF YOGA AND NATUROPATHY ON LIVER, RENAL AND CARDIORESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS OF A PATIENT WITH HEPATIC CIRRHOSIS WITH PORTAL HYPERTENSION AND ASCITES: A CASE REPORT. A 39-YEAR-OLD, MARRIED MAN WAS DIAGNOSED WITH HEPATIC CIRRHOSIS WITH PORTAL HYPERTENSION AND ASCITES IN FEBRUARY 2016. HIS SYMPTOMS AS DESCRIBED BY HIM BEGAN WITH GENERALIZED BODY WEAKNESS, BREATHLESSNESS AND SUDDEN WEIGHT GAIN OF 16KG WITHIN 3 WEEKS. HISTORY OF REGULAR INTAKE OF ALCOHOL SINCE 7 YEARS AND TREMENDOUS FAMILY STRESS WERE PRESENT. PATIENT UNDERWENT CONVENTIONAL MEDICATION FOR 6 MONTHS AND AYURVEDIC MEDICATIONS FOR 4 MONTHS. IN JANUARY 2017, HE VISITED OUR HOSPITAL WITH THE SAME COMPLAINTS AND UNDERWENT INTEGRATED NATUROPATHY AND YOGA THERAPIES (INYTS) FOR 4 WEEKS ALONG WITH AYURVEDA AND CONVENTIONAL MEDICATIONS. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SHOWED A BETTER REDUCTION IN BODY WEIGHT, BODY MASS INDEX, ABDOMINAL GIRTH, SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE ALONG WITH IMPROVEMENT IN BREATH HOLDING TIME, HEMOGLOBIN LEVEL, LIVER FUNCTION TEST AND RENAL FUNCTION TEST. IT SUGGESTS THAT 4 WEEKS OF INYT WITH AYURVEDA AND CONVENTIONAL MEDICATIONS WAS EFFECTIVE IN PATIENTS WITH HEPATIC CIRRHOSIS WITH PORTAL HYPERTENSION AND ASCITES. FURTHER STUDIES ARE REQUIRED TO WARRANT THESE RESULTS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
11 1540  38 KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDE, AND PRACTICE OF YOGA IN RURAL AND URBAN INDIA, KAPY 2017: A NATIONWIDE CLUSTER SAMPLE SURVEY. : BACKGROUND: TO EXAMINE THE KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDES, AND PRACTICE GAP OF YOGA ACROSS INDIA BASED ON IMPLICIT PERCEPTIONS. METHODS: THE PRESENT STUDY IS A NATIONWIDE DOOR-TO-DOOR SURVEY CONDUCTED USING A QUESTIONNAIRE/SCREENING FORM. THE DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM A NATIONAL SURVEY CONDUCTED UNDER THE NIYANTRIT MADHUMEH BHARAT (NMB) PROGRAM INITIATED BY THE MINISTRY OF AYURVEDA, YOGA, UNANI, SIDDHA, HOMEOPATHY (AYUSH), GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, FROM ALL MAJOR ZONES OF THE COUNTRY. A TOTAL OF 162,330 PARTICIPANTS WHO JOINED THE NMB PROGRAM WERE RECRUITED IN OUR STUDY. RESULTS: OUT OF THE TOTAL RESPONDENTS TO THE SURVEY, IT WAS OBSERVED THAT 11.8% [13,336/112,735] PRACTICE YOGA, WHICH WAS HIGHEST IN THE NORTH ZONE [4,567/112,735] AND LOWEST IN THE EAST ZONE [971/112,735]. OUT OF 101,643 RESPONDENTS, 94,135 OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE SURVEY BELIEVED THAT YOGA IMPROVED THEIR LIFESTYLE, AND 90,102/98,518 BELIEVED THAT YOGA PREVENTED DIABETES, REVEALING A HUGE KNOWLEDGE-PRACTICE GAP. CONCLUSIONS: THE SCALE OF THE KNOWLEDGE-PRACTICE GAP COUPLED WITH THE GENERAL ACCEPTABILITY OF YOGA CALLS FOR A CHANGE IN THE CONVENTIONAL HEALTHCARE PROVISIONS BY ITS INTEGRATION WITH MODERN MEDICINE. THE POPULATION-WIDE POSITIVE PERCEPTIONS ABOUT YOGA AS A PREVENTIVE HEALTH TOOL CAN NOT ONLY CATALYZE CONSENSUS DISEASE-SPECIFIC YOGA MODULES BUT ALSO BRIDGE THE KNOWLEDGE-PRACTICE GAP THAT EXISTS BECAUSE OF LIMITED YOGA CENTERS AND PROFESSIONALS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
12  382  32 BELIEFS, ATTITUDES AND SELF-USE OF AYURVEDA, YOGA AND NATUROPATHY, UNANI, SIDDHA, AND HOMEOPATHY MEDICINES AMONG SENIOR PHARMACY STUDENTS: AN EXPLORATORY INSIGHT FROM ANDHRA PRADESH, INDIA. OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE BELIEFS, ATTITUDES AND SELF-USE OF AYURVEDA, YOGA AND NATUROPATHY, UNANI, SIDDHA, AND HOMEOPATHY (AYUSH) MEDICINES AMONG SENIOR PHARMACY STUDENTS. METHODOLOGY: THIS WAS A DESCRIPTIVE CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY CONDUCTED AMONG PHARMACY STUDENTS IN FOUR PHARMACY SCHOOLS LOCATED IN ANDHRA PRADESH IN SOUTH INDIA. THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED FROM THE AUGUST TO SEPTEMBER 2014. THE STUDY POPULATION INCLUDED ALL PHARMACY STUDENTS ENROLLED IN DOCTOR OF PHARMACY, BACHELOR OF PHARMACY AND DIPLOMA IN PHARMACY PROGRAMS IN STUDIED PHARMACY SCHOOLS. THE PRETESTED AYUSH SURVEY HAD 8 QUESTIONS ON AYUSH RELATED BELIEFS AND 8 QUESTION ON AYUSH RELATED ATTITUDES. THE SURVEY ALSO ASKED PARTICIPANTS ABOUT AYUSH RELATED KNOWLEDGE, FREQUENCY OF USE OF AYUSH AND THE REASON FOR USING AYUSH. THE DATA ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED USING SPSS VERSION 20. CHI-SQUARE TEST AND MANN-WHITNEY U-TEST WERE EMPLOYED TO STUDY THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE INDEPENDENT AND DEPENDENT VARIABLES. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 428 PHARMACY STUDENTS PARTICIPATED IN THE SURVEY. 32.2% OF THE STUDY POPULATION WAS FEMALES AND 32.5% OF THE POPULATION RESIDED IN RURAL AREAS. MALES WERE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE POSITIVE BELIEFS ABOUT AYUSH WHEN COMPARED TO FEMALES (ODD RATIO [OR] = 4.62, CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI] = 2.37-8.99, P < 0.001). SIMILARLY, STUDENTS LIVING IN HOSTELS WERE MORE POSITIVE IN THEIR BELIEFS ABOUT AYUSH COMPARED WITH STUDENTS LIVING AT HOME (OR = 2.14, CI = 1.12-4.07, P < 0.05). STUDENTS LIVING IN HOSTEL ALSO HAD A POSITIVE ATTITUDE ABOUT AYUSH USE (OR = 1.74, CI = 1.03-2.93, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: PHARMACY STUDENTS HELD FAVORABLE ATTITUDE AND BELIEFS ABOUT AYUSH USE. THIS BASELINE SURVEY PROVIDES IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE PHARMACY STUDENT'S PERCEPTION ABOUT AYUSH. FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO EXPLORE THE REASONS THAT SHAPE THE PHARMACY STUDENT'S BELIEFS AND ATTITUDES ABOUT AYUSH.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
13  374  46 AYURVEDA BODY-MIND CONSTITUTIONAL TYPES AND ROLE OF YOGA INTERVENTION AMONG TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS POPULATION OF CHANDIGARH AND PANCHKULA REGIONS. BACKGROUND: TYPE 2 DIABETES NEEDS A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF ETIOLOGICAL FACTORS AND MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES BASED ON LIFESTYLE AND CONSTITUTIONAL FACTORS, GIVEN ITS HIGH ASSOCIATION RATE WITH MANY CARDIOVASCULAR, NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS, AND COVID-19 INFECTION. PURPOSE: THE PRESENT STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF DIABETES-SPECIFIC INTEGRATED YOGA LIFESTYLE PROTOCOL (DYP) ON GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND LIPID PROFILES OF DIABETIC ADULTS. ALONG WITH THE DYP INTERVENTION, THE INDIVIDUALS RESIDING IN CHANDIGARH AND PANCHKULA UNION TERRITORIES IN THE NORTHERN PART OF INDIA WERE ASSESSED FOR AYURVEDA-BASED BODY-MIND CONSTITUTIONAL TYPE. AYURVEDA DESCRIBES BODY-MIND CONSTITUTION AS "PRAKRITI," WHICH HAS BEEN DISCUSSED FROM TWO ANGLES, NAMELY PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL AS BODY AND MIND ARE CORRELATED. METHODS: CLUSTER SAMPLING OF WAITLIST CONTROL STUDY SUBJECTS WAS USED AS THE SAMPLING METHOD FOR THE STUDY. A TOTAL OF 1,215 REGISTERED SUBJECTS (81 DIABETIC) RESPONDED IN RANDOMLY SELECTED CLUSTERS IN CHANDIGARH AND PANCHKULA. AYURVEDA PHYSICIANS DID AYURVEDA BODY-MIND CONSTITUTIONAL ASSESSMENT CALLED PRAKRITI ASSESSMENT (PHYSIOLOGICAL BODY-MIND CONSTITUTION ASSESSMENT) IN 35 PARTICIPANTS (23 DIABETIC, 12 PREDIABETIC) AS A PART OF THE STUDY. RESULTS: A GROUP OF 50 SUBJECTS WAS RANDOMLY SELECTED FOR YOGA INTERVENTION OUT OF 81 DIABETES MELLITUS ADULTS, AND 31 SUBJECTS WERE ENROLLED AS WAITLIST CONTROLS. A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN LEVELS FROM 8.49 +/- 1.94% TO 7.97 +/- 2.20% IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP WAS NOTICED. THE LIPID PROFILES OF THE DYP INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS WERE MONITORED. THREE-MONTH FOLLOW-UP RESULTS OF LIPID PROFILE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS IN INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS (P < 0.05). MOST DIABETIC AND PREDIABETIC INDIVIDUALS WERE FOUND TO HAVE PITTA DOSHA (PITTA CONTROLS ALL HEAT, METABOLISM, AND TRANSFORMATION IN THE MIND AND BODY) AS DOMINANT CONSTITUTION TYPE. CONCLUSION: THE STUDY RESULTS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN DIABETIC INDIVIDUALS. THIS STUDY HAS INDICATED THE EVIDENCE FOR THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THE VALIDATED DYP FOR COMMUNITY-LEVEL INTERVENTIONS TO PREVENT MALADIES LIKE BRAIN DAMAGE AND STROKE.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
14  484  33 CLINICAL EVALUATION OF THE EFFICACY OF KHADIRADI YOGA AVACHOORNANA IN KACHCHU WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO GENITOINGUINAL INTERTRIGO. KACHCHU IS A SIMPLE LOCALIZED DERMATOLOGICAL INFECTION OF THE GENITOINGUINAL REGION, WHICH OCCURS BECAUSE OF UNHYGIENIC OBSERVANCE, AND MANIFESTS IN THE FORM OF INFLAMMATION FOLLOWED BY SECONDARY BACTERIAL OR FUNGAL INFECTIONS THAT CAN BE BEST CORRELATED TO GENITOINGUINAL INTERTRIGO. EVEN THOUGH IT RARELY CAUSES SYSTEMIC MANIFESTATIONS, ITS MERE PRESENCE ITSELF IS DISTURBING BECAUSE OF INTRACTABLE ITCHING AND PAIN. IT MAY DELAY THE PROPER HEALING OF THE EPISIOTOMY WOUND AND MAY CAUSE DIFFICULTY IN WALKING BECAUSE OF SEVERE PAIN. CANDIDA POWDER IS THE HIGHEST SELLING MEDICINE FOR THE INTERTRIGO, AS THE INCIDENCE OF INTERTRIGO IS AS HIGH AS 40% IN SOME PARTICULAR SEASONS. IN THE AYURVEDA FRATERNITY, THERE IS NO ESTABLISHED PREPARATION THAT CAN BE PRESERVED SAFELY IN ALL THE EPOCHS OF LIFE IN FEMALES AND WHICH IS EASY TO APPLY. AFTER UNDERSTANDING THE DISEASE IN THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE AYURVEDIC AND MODERN MEDICINAL SYSTEMS, KHADIRADI YOGA CHOORNA - A NEW AYURVEDIC FORMULATION - WAS PREPARED ON THE BASIS OF STRINGENT AYURVEDIC PRINCIPLES. HENCE, AN ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE TO STUDY THE EFFICACY OF THE KHADIRADI YOGA AVACHURNANA(1) IN KACHCHU, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO GENITOINGUINAL INTERTRIGO IN FEMALES.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
15 1850  23 RAISING BURDEN OF NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES: IMPORTANCE OF INTEGRATING YOGA AND NATUROPATHY AT PRIMARY CARE LEVEL. PRIMARY HEALTH CARE IS A VITAL COMPONENT IN HEALTH CARE DELIVERY. NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES (NCD'S) ARE RISING LIKE A MAJOR THREAT TO HUMAN SURVIVAL, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO ACCOUNT FOR 75% OF THE TOTAL MORTALITY BY 2030. LIFESTYLE AND BEHAVIOURAL CHANGES ARE RECKONED AS THE WAY AHEAD. YOGA AND NATUROPATHY, A DRUGLESS SYSTEM OF MEDICINE HAS INTERSECTING PARADIGMS WHICH ADDRESSES ALL PLANES OF HEALTH EFFECTIVELY. YOGA AND NATUROPATHY THROUGH ITS HOLISTIC APPROACH EDUCATE AND MAKE THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR OWN HEALTH. IT HAS SHOWN ITS EFFICACY IN ALLEVIATING AND PREVENTING VARIOUS NCD'S. A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH SHOULD BE INITIATED, WHICH CAN CHANNELIZE THE INTEGRATION OF YOGA AND NATUROPATHY AT THE PRIMARY CARE LEVEL CONSIDERING ITS COST-EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICACY OVER NCD'S.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
16   77  20 A HOLISTIC ANTENATAL MODEL BASED ON YOGA, AYURVEDA, AND VEDIC GUIDELINES. THE PREVALENCE OF PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS ARE ON THE RISE GLOBALLY WITH SEVERE CONSEQUENCES. ACCORDING TO THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO, 2009), EVERY MINUTE, AT LEAST ONE WOMAN DIES AND 20 ARE AFFECTED BY THE COMPLICATIONS RELATED TO PREGNANCY OR CHILDBIRTH. WHILE THE ROOT CAUSE OF PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS IS UNCLEAR, IT LIKELY HAS PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, SOCIAL, AND SPIRITUAL ASPECTS. THE VEDAS ARE A RICH SOURCE OF ANTENATAL HEALTH CARE GUIDELINES IN ALL THESE ASPECTS. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE AUTHORS WAS TO COMPILE THE SCRIPTURAL AND SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE FOR A HOLISTIC ANTENATAL MODEL OF YOGA WITH EMPHASIS ON SOCIOCULTURAL INDIAN PRACTICES.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
17 2378  22 WHY AYURVEDIC YOGA THERAPISTS AND WHY NOW? IAYT HAS PAVED THE WAY FOR YOGA THERAPY AS A HEALING PROFESSION TO GROW AND DEVELOP ITS MISSION TO DELIVER OPTIMAL THERAPEUTICS VIA INDIVIDUAL SESSIONS AND TAILORED GROUP CLASSES. FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS, THE NATIONAL AYURVEDIC MEDICAL ASSOCIATION (NAMA) HAS BEEN WORKING BEHIND THE SCENES TO CONSIDER THE VALUE AND DEFINITION OF AN AYURVEDIC YOGA THERAPIST (AYT) PROFESSIONAL DESIGNATION WITHIN THE YOGA THERAPY DISCIPLINE. THE AYT DESIGNATION WOULD COMPLEMENT THE CURRENT STANDARDS FOR YOGA THERAPISTS THAT HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED BY IAYT. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO DISCUSS (1) WHY THE AYT DESIGNATION IS IMPORTANT; (2) HOW IT SUPPORTS AND EXPANDS ON IAYT'S MISSION; AND (3) WHY NOW IS THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO DEVELOP COMPETENCIES, STANDARDS, AND A SCOPE OF PRACTICE FOR AYURVEDIC YOGA THERAPY.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
18  483  46 CLINICAL EFFICACY OF VAMANA KARMA WITH IKSHWAAKU BEEJA YOGA FOLLOWED BY SHATAPUSHPADI GHANAVATI IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ARTAVA KSHAYA W. S. R TO POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME. BACKGROUND: DUE TO SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE AND STRESS, THE INCIDENCE OF METABOLIC DISORDERS ARE INCREASING DAY BY DAY. AMONG THESE POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME (PCOS) IS AN INTRICATE DISORDER AFFECTING 4%-8% WOMEN IN THEIR REPRODUCTIVE AGE AND RELATED TO OVARIAN DYSFUNCTION CHARACTERIZED BY OBESITY, OLIGOMENORRHEA, ANOVULATION AND HYPERANDROGENISM. IN MODERN SYSTEM OF MEDICINE, THE AVAILABLE ALLOPATHIC REGIMEN HAS ITS OWN LIMITATIONS, SO IT IS NEED OF TIME TO FIND A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE THERAPY FOR SUCH TYPE OF CONDITION. THE MOST COMMON SYMPTOM IN 85%-90% OF PCOS PATIENTS IS OLIGOMENORRHEA WHICH CAN BE CORRELATED TO ARTAVA KSHAYA (LOSS OF MENSTRUAL FLUID) IN AYURVEDA. HENCE, IN THE PRESENT CLINICAL STUDY, VAMANA KARMA (THERAPEUTIC VOMITING) WITH IKSHWAAKU SEED FORMULATION FOLLOWED BY SHATAPUSHPADI GHANAVATI WAS PLANNED. AIMS: TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF VAMANA KARMA (THERAPEUTIC VOMITING) FOLLOWED BY SHATAPUSHPADI GHANAVATI IN THE MANAGEMENT OF AARTAVA KSHAYA (LOSS OF MENSTRUAL FLUID) W. S. R TO PCOS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 15 PATIENTS OF PCOS WERE CLINICALLY DIAGNOSED AND TREATED BY VAMANA KARMA (THERAPEUTIC VOMITING) PROCEDURE WITH IKSHWAAKU SEED FORMULATION. AFTER COMPLETION OF VAMANA KARMA (THERAPEUTIC VOMITING) AND SAMSARJANA KRAMA, (POST THERAPY DIETARY REGIMEN FOR REVIVAL) SHATAPUSHPADI GHANAVATI 2 VATI (EACH 500 MG) TWICE IN A DAY WITH LUKEWARM WATER WAS GIVEN FOR 45 DAYS. AFTER COMPLETION OF 2-MONTH TRIAL, ASSESSMENT OF THERAPY WAS ESTIMATED BY SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE PARAMETERS. RESULTS: STATISTICALLY EXTREMELY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.0001) RESULTS WERE FOUND IN MENSTRUAL IRREGULARITIES, OBESITY, AND BODY MASS INDEX. THE SIGNIFICANT RESULT IN REDUCTION OF NONDOMINANT FOLLICLES (P = 0.01 AND 0.03 FOR RIGHT AND LEFT OVARY, RESPECTIVELY), LOWERING THE FASTING BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL (P = 0.02) AND HIRSUTISM (P = 0.03) WAS FOUND. CONCLUSION: VAMANA KARMA (THERAPEUTIC VOMITING) FOLLOWED BY SHATAPUSHPADI GHANAVATI IS VERY EFFECTIVE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF OBESE PCOS PATIENTS AND INCREASING CHANCES OF CONCEPTION.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
19  400  27 BEYOND THE EAST/WEST DICHOTOMY-THE COURSE YOGA: THEORY AND PRACTICE CONVEYS THE BENEFITS OF AN AYURVEDIC LENS FOR GLOBAL HEALTH. THE COURSE YOGA: THEORY AND PRACTICE (YTP) EVOLVED FROM THE REALIZATION THAT GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE ACADEMIC OFFERINGS OF "YOGA COURSES" WERE FILLED BEYOND CAPACITY, WHILE STUDENTS WERE NOT BEING EXPOSED TO THE DEPTH AND BREADTH OF WHAT YOGA HAS TO OFFER AS A HOLISTIC, INTEGRATIVE PRACTICE, NOR HOW IT GREW UP ALONGSIDE AYURVEDA. STUDENTS EXPERIENTIALLY UNDERSTOOD THE CONTRIBUTION THAT YOGA PRACTICE MADE IN THEIR LIVES AND SENSED THE HEALTH BENEFITS IT AFFORDED. YET, THEY WERE HUNGRY FOR AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE LENS THROUGH WHICH YOGA EMERGED.

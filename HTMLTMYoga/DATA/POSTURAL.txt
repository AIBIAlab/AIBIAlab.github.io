1  510 135 COMPARATIVE IMPACTS OF TAI CHI, BALANCE TRAINING, AND A SPECIALLY-DESIGNED YOGA PROGRAM ON BALANCE IN OLDER FALLERS. OBJECTIVE: TO COMPARE THE EFFECT OF A CUSTOM-DESIGNED YOGA PROGRAM WITH 2 OTHER BALANCE TRAINING PROGRAMS. DESIGN: RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: RESEARCH LABORATORY. PARTICIPANTS: A GROUP OF OLDER ADULTS (N=39; MEAN AGE, 74.15 +/- 6.99 Y) WITH A HISTORY OF FALLING. INTERVENTIONS: THREE DIFFERENT EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS (TAI CHI, STANDARD BALANCE TRAINING, YOGA) WERE GIVEN FOR 12 WEEKS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: BALANCE PERFORMANCE WAS EXAMINED DURING PRE- AND POSTTEST USING FIELD TESTS, INCLUDING THE 8-FOOT UP-AND-GO TEST, 1-LEG STANCE, FUNCTIONAL REACH, AND USUAL AND MAXIMAL WALKING SPEED. THE STATIC AND DYNAMIC BALANCES WERE ALSO ASSESSED BY POSTURAL SWAY AND DYNAMIC POSTUROGRAPHY, RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS: TRAINING PRODUCED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN ALL FIELD TESTS (P<.005), BUT GROUP DIFFERENCE AND TIME X GROUP INTERACTION WERE NOT DETECTED. FOR POSTURAL SWAY, SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN THE AREA OF THE CENTER OF PRESSURE WITH EYES OPEN (P=.001) AND EYES CLOSED (P=.002) WERE DETECTED AFTER TRAINING. FOR EYES OPEN, MAXIMUM MEDIAL-LATERAL VELOCITY SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED FOR THE SAMPLE (P=.013). FOR EYES CLOSED, MEDIAL-LATERAL DISPLACEMENT DECREASED FOR TAI CHI (P<.01). FOR DYNAMIC POSTUROGRAPHY, SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN OVERALL SCORE (P=.001), TIME ON THE TEST (P=.006), AND 2 LINEAR MEASURES IN LATERAL (P=.001) AND ANTERIOR-POSTERIOR (P<.001) DIRECTIONS WERE SEEN FOR THE SAMPLE. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA WAS AS EFFECTIVE AS TAI CHI AND STANDARD BALANCE TRAINING FOR IMPROVING POSTURAL STABILITY AND MAY OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE TO MORE TRADITIONAL PROGRAMS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
2 1672  39 NONLINEAR MEASURES IN POSTUROGRAPHY COMPARED TO LINEAR MEASURES BASED ON YOGA POSES PERFORMANCE. PURPOSE: YOGA IS KNOWN AS A TYPE OF EXERCISE THAT COMBINES PHYSICAL, MENTAL AND SPIRITUAL ASPECTS. THERE HAS NOT BEEN MUCH RESEARCH ON THE POSTURAL CONTROL IN VARIOUS YOGA POSES. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE COP REGULARITY IN BOTH YOGA INSTRUCTORS AND NOVICES DURING THE PERFORMANCE OF FOUR YOGA POSES, AND TO VERIFY THE SENSITIVITY OF LINEAR AND NONLINEAR METHODS FOR ASSESSING POSTURAL STABILITY. METHODS: THE DYNAMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF COP FLUCTUATIONS WERE EXAMINED USING LINEAR AND NONLINEAR METHODS ON A GROUP OF 22 YOGA INSTRUCTORS (Y) AND 18 AGE-MATCHED NON-PRACTITIONERS OF YOGA (NY). THE STUDY INVOLVED MAINTAINING A BALANCE FOR 20 SECONDS WHILE PERFORMING FOUR YOGA POSES. RESULTS: CONVENTIONAL ANALYSIS OF COP TRAJECTORIES SHOWED THAT NY AND Y EXHIBITED SIMILAR CONTROL OF POSTURAL SWAY, AS INDICATED BY SIMILAR COP PATH-LENGTH AND AREA VALUES OBSERVED IN BOTH GROUPS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE SPECIAL BALANCE YOGA TRAINING RECEIVED BY Y MAY NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON LESS CHALLENGING BALANCE CONDITIONS, SUCH AS THE POSES USED IN THIS EXPERIMENT. INTERESTINGLY, NONLINEAR DYNAMICAL ANALYSIS OF COP SHOWED THAT Y EXHIBITED LESS COP REGULARITY AND MORE COMPLEX SIGNAL THAN NY, AS EVIDENCED BY HIGHER VALUES OF SAMPLE ENTROPY AND FRACTAL DIMENSION. CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS SHED LIGHT ON THE SURPLUS VALUES OF COP TRAJECTORIES IN THE NONLINEAR DYNAMICAL ANALYSIS TO GAIN FURTHER INSIGHT INTO THE MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN POSTURE CONTROL.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
3 1144  26 ELECTROMYOGRAPHIC PATTERN DURING GAIT INITIATION DIFFERENTIATES YOGA PRACTITIONERS AMONG PHYSICALLY ACTIVE OLDER SUBJECTS. DURING GAIT INITIATION, POSTURAL ADJUSTMENTS ARE NEEDED TO DEAL WITH BALANCE AND MOVEMENT. WITH AGING, GAIT INITIATION CHANGES AND REFLECTS FUNCTIONAL DEGRADATION OF FRAILTY INDIVIDUALS. HOWEVER, PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF DAILY MOTOR TASKS. THE AIM OF OUR STUDY WAS TO COMPARE CENTER OF PRESSURE (COP) DISPLACEMENT AND ANKLE MUSCLE CO-ACTIVATION DURING GAIT INITIATION IN TWO PHYSICALLY ACTIVE GROUPS: A GROUP OF WALKERS (N = 12; MEAN AGE +/- SD 72.6 +/- 3.2 YEARS) AND A YOGA GROUP (N = 11; 71.5 +/- 3.8 YEARS). COP TRAJECTORY AND ELECTROMYOGRAPHY OF LEG MUSCLES WERE RECORDED SIMULTANEOUSLY DURING FIVE SUCCESSIVE TRIALS OF GAIT INITIATION. OUR MAIN FINDING WAS THAT YOGA PRACTITIONERS HAD SLOWER COP DISPLACEMENTS (P < 0.01) AND LOWER LEG MUSCLES % OF COACTIVATION (P < 0.01) IN COMPARISON WITH WALKERS. THESE PARAMETERS WHICH CHARACTERIZED GAIT INITIATION CONTROL WERE CORRELATED (R = 0.76; P < 0.01). OUR RESULTS EMPHASIZE THAT LENGTHY ANKLE MUSCLE CO-ACTIVATION AND COP PATH IN GAIT INITIATION DIFFERENTIATE YOGA PRACTITIONERS AMONG PHYSICALLY ACTIVE SUBJECTS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
4 1276  31 FUNCTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS IN PARKINSON'S DISEASE FOLLOWING A RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF YOGA. INDIVIDUALS WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD) EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS IN MOTOR FUNCTION, FUNCTIONAL GAIT, POSTURAL STABILITY, AND BALANCE. THESE LIMITATIONS OFTEN LEAD TO HIGHER INCIDENCES OF FALLS, WHICH HAVE SIGNIFICANT COMPLICATIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH PD. YOGA MAY IMPROVE THESE FUNCTIONAL DEFICITS IN INDIVIDUALS WITH PD. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE CHANGES IN MOTOR FUNCTION, FUNCTIONAL GAIT, POSTURAL STABILITY, AND BALANCE CONTROL FOR COMMUNITY DWELLING INDIVIDUALS WITH PD. THIS RANDOMIZED, WAIT-LIST CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY EXAMINED THE INFLUENCE OF AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION FOR PEOPLE WITH PD WHO MET THE FOLLOWING INCLUSION CRITERIA: ENDORSING A FEAR OF FALLING, BEING ABLE TO SPEAK ENGLISH, SCORING 4/6 ON THE MINIMENTAL STATE EXAM, AND BEING WILLING TO ATTEND THE INTERVENTION TWICE WEEKLY FOR 8-WEEKS. PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP (N=15) EXPERIENCED IMPROVEMENTS IN MOTOR FUNCTION, POSTURAL STABILITY, FUNCTIONAL GAIT, AND FREEZING GAIT, AS WELL AS REDUCTIONS IN FALL RISK. PARTICIPANTS IN THE WAIT-LIST CONTROL (N=12) ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED IN POSTURAL STABILITY, ALTHOUGH THEIR FALL RISK WAS NOT REDUCED. INDIVIDUALS IN THE YOGA GROUP SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THEIR FALL RISK. AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION MAY REDUCE FALL RISK AND IMPROVE POSTURAL STABILITY, AND FUNCTIONAL AND FREEZING GAIT IN INDIVIDUALS WITH PD.

5 2134  42 THE EFFECTS OF A THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM ON POSTURAL CONTROL, MOBILITY, AND GAIT SPEED IN COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF A 12-WEEK THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM ON GAIT SPEED, POSTURAL CONTROL, AND MOBILITY IN COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS. DESIGN: QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WITH A PRETEST/POST-TEST DESIGN. RESEARCHERS EVALUATED CHANGES OVER TIME (PRETEST TO POST-TEST) IN ALL OUTCOME MEASURES. PAIRED T-TESTS WERE USED TO ANALYZE NORMAL AND FAST GAIT SPEED, TIMED UP AND GO TEST, AND TIMED UP AND GO DUAL TASK. WILCOXON SIGNED-RANK TEST WAS USED TO EVALUATE SCORES FOR THE MINI-BESTEST (MBT). SETTING: YOGA CLASSES WERE PERFORMED AT A LOCAL SENIOR CENTER. BLIND EXAMINERS WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY TRAINED IN THE OUTCOME MEASURES PERFORMED ALL PRETESTS AND POST-TESTS AT THE SITE. PARTICIPANTS: THIRTEEN ADULTS (12 WOMEN AND 1 MAN, WITH A MEAN AGE+/-STANDARD DEVIATION OF 72+/-6.9 YEARS) COMPLETED THE STUDY. RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS HAD MINIMAL TO NO YOGA EXPERIENCE. INTERVENTIONS: A 12-WEEK, 60-MINUTE, BIWEEKLY KRIPALU YOGA CLASS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS. OUTCOME MEASURES: POSTURAL CONTROL (MBT), MOBILITY (TIMED UP AND GO TEST), AND GAIT SPEED (NORMAL AND FAST) WERE ASSESSED. RESULTS: ALL 13 PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED AT LEAST 19 OF THE 24 CLASSES (80% ATTENDANCE). STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE SEEN IN THE MBT (P=0.039), NORMAL GAIT SPEED (P=0.015), FAST GAIT SPEED (P=0.001), TIMED UP AND GO TEST (P=0.045), AND TIMED UP AND GO DUAL-TASK (P=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: IMPROVEMENTS IN POSTURAL CONTROL AND MOBILITY AS MEASURED BY THE MBT AND TIMED UP AND GO GAIT AS MEASURED BY FAST GAIT SPEED INDICATE THAT RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS BENEFITTED FROM THE THERAPEUTIC YOGA INTERVENTION. THE YOGA PROGRAM DESIGNED FOR THIS STUDY INCLUDED ACTIVITIES IN STANDING, SITTING, AND LYING ON THE FLOOR AND MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING MOBILITY, POSTURAL CONTROL, AND GAIT SPEED IN COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
6  965  47 EFFECTS OF A YOGA PROGRAM ON POSTURAL CONTROL, MOBILITY, AND GAIT SPEED IN COMMUNITY-LIVING OLDER ADULTS: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVES: TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF AN 8-WEEK THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM ON POSTURAL CONTROL, MOBILITY, RISING FROM THE FLOOR, AND GAIT SPEED IN COMMUNITY-LIVING OLDER ADULTS. DESIGN: PRETEST/POSTTEST DESIGN WITH AN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND AN AGE-MATCHED CONTROL GROUP. CHANGES OVER TIME (PRETEST TO POSTTEST) WERE EVALUATED IN ALL OUTCOME MEASURES USING PAIRED T TESTS. SETTING: THE YOGA CLASS WAS PERFORMED AT A LOCAL CONTINUING CARE RETIREMENT COMMUNITY. ALL TESTING WAS PERFORMED AT THE SITE. CONTROL-SUBJECT PRETESTS AND POSTTESTS WERE PERFORMED AT A SECOND CONTINUING CARE RETIREMENT COMMUNITY. PARTICIPANTS: EIGHT RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS, ALL WOMEN, WITH A MEAN AGE OF 84 (4.6) YEARS, 8 CONTROL PARTICIPANTS, 5 WOMEN AND 3 MEN, AGED 81.3 (4.9) YEARS. RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS WERE NAIVE TO YOGA. INTERVENTIONS: AN 8-WEEK, 80-MINUTE, BIWEEKLY KRIPALU YOGA CLASS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: POSTURAL CONTROL (BERG BALANCE SCALE), MOBILITY (TIME TO RISE FROM THE FLOOR TO STANDING, TIMED UP AND GO), GAIT (USUAL AND FAST GAIT SPEED), AND BALANCE CONFIDENCE (ACTIVITIES-SPECIFIC BALANCE SCALE). RESULTS: ALL SUBJECTS ATTENDED AT LEAST 10 OF THE 16 CLASSES (62% ATTENDANCE). POSTTEST DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND FOR YOGA PARTICIPANTS IN BALANCE SCORES (P < .003) AND FAST WALKING SPEED (P < .031). NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE NOTED. CONCLUSIONS: IMPROVEMENTS IN POSTURAL CONTROL AS MEASURED BY THE BERG BALANCE SCALE AND GAIT AS MEASURED BY FAST GAIT SPEED INDICATE THAT RESEARCH SUBJECTS BENEFITED FROM THE YOGA INTERVENTION. THE YOGA PROGRAM DESIGNED FOR THIS STUDY INCLUDED THE ACTIVITIES OF STANDING, SITTING, AND LYING ON THE FLOOR. THEREFORE, SUBJECTS PERFORM ACTIVITIES DURING YOGA THAT CAN IMPROVE POSTURAL CONTROL, MOBILITY, AND GAIT SPEED.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
7 2815  37 YOGA TRAINING HAS POSITIVE EFFECTS ON POSTURAL BALANCE AND ITS INFLUENCE ON ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING IN PEOPLE WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: A PILOT STUDY. CONTEXT: THERE IS A LITTLE EVIDENCE ABOUT THE INFLUENCE OF YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR POSTURAL BALANCE AND ITS INFLUENCE ON ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) PATIENTS. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE INFLUENCE OF A SIX-MONTH YOGA PROGRAM ON POSTURAL BALANCE AND SUBJECTIVE IMPACT OF POSTURAL BALANCE IMPAIRMENT ON ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING IN PEOPLE WITH MS. DESIGN: RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY. SETTING: PROTOCOL DEVELOPED AT THE ADAPTIVE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY STUDY DEPARTMENT, COLLEGE OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION, STATE UNIVERSITY OF CAMPINAS, BRAZIL. SUBJECTS: A TOTAL OF 12 (11 WOMEN) YOGA NAIVE PEOPLE WITH MS RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS AS FOLLOWS: CONTROL (C-WAITING LIST, N = 6) AND YOGA (Y-YOGA TRAINING, N = 6). INTERVENTIONS: YOGA GROUP PRACTICED POSTURES, BREATHING EXERCISES, MEDITATION, AND RELAXATION ON WEEKLY 60-MIN CLASSES FOR A SIX-MONTH PERIOD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: THE FOLLOWING EVALUATIONS WERE PERFORMED AT STUDY ENTRY (BASELINE), AND AFTER SIX MONTHS (SIX MONTHS): BERG BALANCE SCALE (BBS), EXPANDED DISABILITY STATUS SCALE (EDSS), AND SELF-REPORTED POSTURAL BALANCE QUALITY AND INFLUENCE OF POSTURAL BALANCE ON ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN BBS SCORE FROM BASELINE TO SIX MONTHS ONLY IN THE YOGA GROUP, ESPECIALLY IN SUBJECTS WITH HIGHER EDSS SCORE, WITH INCREASED QUALITY OF SELF-REPORTED POSTURAL BALANCE, AND DECREASED INFLUENCE OF POSTURAL BALANCE IMPAIRMENT ON ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING. IN CONCLUSION, A SIX-MONTH YOGA TRAINING IS BENEFICIAL FOR PEOPLE WITH MS, SINCE IT IMPROVES POSTURAL BALANCE AND DECREASES THE INFLUENCE OF POSTURAL BALANCE IMPAIRMENT ON ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING. A GREATER SAMPLE SIZE IS NECESSARY TO INCREASE GENERALIZATION, BUT IT SEEMS THAT YOGA COULD BE INCLUDED AS A FEASIBLE COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR PEOPLE WITH MS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                            
8  506  61 COMPARATIVE EFFECT OF POWER TRAINING AND HIGH-SPEED YOGA ON MOTOR FUNCTION IN OLDER PATIENTS WITH PARKINSON DISEASE. OBJECTIVES: TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF POWER TRAINING (PWT) AND A HIGH-SPEED YOGA PROGRAM ON PHYSICAL PERFORMANCES IN OLDER PATIENTS WITH PARKINSON DISEASE (PD), AND TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT BOTH TRAINING INTERVENTIONS WOULD ATTENUATE PD SYMPTOMS AND IMPROVE PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE. DESIGN: RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: A LABORATORY OF NEUROMUSCULAR RESEARCH AND ACTIVE AGING. PARTICIPANTS: PATIENTS WITH PD (N=41; MEAN AGE +/- SD, 72.2 +/- 6.5Y). INTERVENTIONS: TWO HIGH-SPEED EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS (SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED YOGA PROGRAM AND PWT) WERE GIVEN FOR 12 WEEKS (TWICE A WEEK), AND 1 NONEXERCISE CONTROL GROUP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: UNIFIED PARKINSON DISEASE RATING SCALE MOTOR SCORE (UPDRSMS), BERG BALANCE SCALE (BBS), MINI-BALANCE EVALUATION SYSTEMS TEST (MINI-BESTEST), TIMED UP AND GO, FUNCTIONAL REACH, SINGLE LEG STANCE (SLS), POSTURAL SWAY TEST, 10-M USUAL AND MAXIMAL WALKING SPEED TESTS, 1 REPETITION MAXIMUM (RM), AND PEAK POWER (PPW) FOR LEG PRESS. RESULTS: FOR THE POSTTESTS, BOTH TRAINING GROUPS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS (P<.05) IN ALL PHYSICAL MEASUREMENTS EXCEPT FUNCTIONAL REACH ON THE MORE AFFECTED SIDE, SLS, AND POSTURAL SWAY COMPARED WITH THE PRETESTS, AND SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER SCORES FOR UPDRSMS, BBS, MINI-BESTEST, TIMED UP AND GO, FUNCTIONAL REACH ON THE LESS AFFECTED SIDE, 10-M USUAL AND MAXIMAL WALKING SPEED TESTS, 1RM, AND PPW THAN CONTROLS, WITH NO DIFFERENCES DETECTED BETWEEN THE YOGA PROGRAM AND PWT. CONCLUSIONS: BOTH THE SPECIALLY DESIGNED YOGA PROGRAM AND PWT PROGRAMS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE IN OLDER PERSONS WITH PD.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
9  884  36 EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON ONE LEG STANDING AND FUNCTIONAL REACH TESTS IN OBESE INDIVIDUALS WITH POOR POSTURAL CONTROL. [PURPOSE] THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON STATIC AND DYNAMIC STANDING BALANCE IN OBESE INDIVIDUALS WITH POOR STANDING BALANCE. [SUBJECTS AND METHODS] SIXTEEN OBESE VOLUNTEERS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED INTO YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS. THE YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM WAS PERFORMED FOR 45 MINUTES PER DAY, 3 TIMES PER WEEK, FOR 4 WEEKS. STATIC AND DYNAMIC BALANCE WERE ASSESSED IN VOLUNTEERS WITH ONE LEG STANDING AND FUNCTIONAL REACH TESTS. OUTCOME MEASURES WERE TESTED BEFORE TRAINING AND AFTER A SINGLE WEEK OF TRAINING. TWO-WAY REPEATED MEASURE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE WITH TUKEY'S HONESTLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE POST HOC STATISTICS WAS USED TO ANALYZE THE DATA. [RESULTS] OBESE INDIVIDUALS SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED STATIC STANDING BALANCE IN THE YOGA TRAINING GROUP, BUT THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OF STATIC OR DYNAMIC STANDING BALANCE IN THE CONTROL GROUP AFTER 4 WEEKS. IN THE YOGA GROUP, SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN STATIC STANDING BALANCE WAS FOUND AFTER THE 2ND, 3RD, AND 4TH WEEKS. COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP, STATIC STANDING BALANCE IN THE YOGA GROUP WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT AFTER THE 2ND WEEK, AND DYNAMIC STANDING BALANCE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT AFTER THE 4TH WEEK. [CONCLUSION] YOGA TRAINING WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR IMPROVING STANDING BALANCE IN OBESE INDIVIDUALS WITH POOR STANDING BALANCE.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
10  537  47 COMPARISONS OF TAI CHI AND IYENGAR YOGA INTERVENTION EFFECTS ON MUSCLE STRENGTH, BALANCE, AND CONFIDENCE IN BALANCE. BACKGROUND: THE AIM OF THE STUDY IS TO COMPARE A 16-WEEK TAI CHI AND IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM EFFECTS ON MUSCLE STRENGTH, STATIC AND DYNAMIC BALANCE, AND BALANCE CONFIDENCE IN ELDERLY PEOPLE. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 48 PARTICIPANTS (>/=60 YEARS OLD) WITHOUT MOBILITY-IMPAIRING NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE, DEMENTIA, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE/SYMPTOMS DURING MODERATE EXERCISE, POORLY CONTROLLED HYPERTENSION, OR BALANCE-IMPAIRING DRUG USE. PARTICIPANTS WERE DIVIDED INTO A TAI CHI GROUP, AN IYENGAR YOGA GROUP, AND A CONTROL GROUP (EIGHT MALES AND EIGHT FEMALES PER GROUP), USING A RESTRICTED RANDOMIZATION SCHEME GENERATED BY SOFTWARE. WHILE THE FORMER TWO UNDERTOOK 16-WEEK EXERCISE PROGRAMS, THE CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED GENERAL EDUCATION. MAXIMUM CONCENTRIC STRENGTH WAS MEASURED WITH AN ISOKINETIC DYNAMOMETER. THE ONE-LEGGED STAND WITH EYES CLOSED, "8 FEET UP AND GO," AND ACTIVITIES-SPECIFIC BALANCE CONFIDENCE (ABC) SCALE WERE USED TO ASSESS STATIC BALANCE, DYNAMIC BALANCE, AND BALANCE CONFIDENCE IN DAILY ACTIVITIES, RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS: BOTH PROGRAMS IMPROVED ALL MEASURES SIGNIFICANTLY WITH TAI CHI BEING MORE EFFECTIVE FOR INCREASING KNEE FL EXOR STRENGTH (P=0.045) AND EXTENSOR STRENGTH (P=0.032) AND ABC SCORE (P=0.034); IYENGAR YOGA WAS MORE EFFECTIVE FOR IMPROVING STATIC BALANCE (P=0.014) AND DYNAMIC BALANCE (P=0.025; ALL P VALUES HERE VS. THE OTHER PROGRAM). CONCLUSIONS: TAI CHI AND IYENGAR YOGA CAN IMPROVE STRENGTH, BALANCE, AND BALANCE CONFIDENCE AMONG OLDER PEOPLE. BOTH ARE SUITABLE EXERCISE CHOICES FOR OLDER ADULTS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
11 2650  34 YOGA IMPROVES BALANCE AND LOW-BACK PAIN, BUT NOT ANXIETY, IN PEOPLE WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE. INDIVIDUALS WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD) EXPERIENCE POSTURAL INSTABILITY, LOW-BACK PAIN (LBP), AND ANXIETY. THESE SYMPTOMS INCREASE THE RISK OF FALLS AND DECREASE QUALITY OF LIFE. RESEARCH SHOWS YOGA IMPROVES BALANCE AND DECREASES LBP AND ANXIETY IN HEALTHY ADULTS, BUT ITS EFFECTS IN PD ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. ALL PARTICIPANTS WERE PART OF A LARGER INTERVENTION STUDY. PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED PRETEST AND POSTTEST EVALUATIONS, INCLUDING THE BALANCE EVALUATION SYSTEMS TEST (BESTEST), BECK ANXIETY INVENTORY (BAI), AND REVISED OSWESTRY DISABILITY INDEX (ROSW). TOTAL SCORES FOR EACH MEASURE, AS WELL AS INDIVIDUAL BALANCE SYSTEM SECTION SCORES FROM THE BESTEST (BIOMECHANICAL CONSTRAINTS, STABILITY LIMITS/VERTICALITY, TRANSITIONS/ANTICIPATORY, REACTIVE, SENSORY ORIENTATION, AND STABILITY IN GAIT) WERE COMPARED WITHIN GROUPS PRE- TO POSTTEST. PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP (N = 13) COMPLETED A TWICE-WEEKLY 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVE N T I O N , WHEREAS CONTROLS (N = 13) CONTINUED THEIR USUAL ROUTINES FOR 12 WEEKS. BOTH THE YOGA (Z = -3.20, P = 0.001) AND CONTROL (Z = -2.10, P = 0.040) GROUPS IMPROVED ON THE BESTEST TOTAL SCORE. THE CONTROL GROUP SHOWED NO CHANGES IN INDIVIDUAL BALANCE SYSTEMS, WHEREAS THE YOGA GROUP IMPROVED IN STABILITY LIMITS/VERTICALITY (Z = -2.3, P = 0.020), TRANSITIONS/ ANTICIPATORY (Z = -2.50, P = 0.010), REACTIVE (Z = -2.70, P = 0.008), AND SENSORY ORIENTATION (Z = -2.30, P = 0.020). ROSW DECREASED IN THE YOGA GROUP ONLY (Z = -2.10, P = 0.030). BAI DID NOT CHANGE IN EITHER GROUP. YOGA IS A NONPHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION THAT CAN IMPROVE BALANCE AND LBP IN PEOPLE WITH PD. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT YOGA IS FEASIBLE FOR PEOPLE WITH PD, AND PARTICIPANTS REPORTED HIGH LEVELS OF ENJOYMENT AND INTENT TO PRACTICE YOGA AFTER THE STUDY.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
12 2027  39 TAI CHI AND YOGA FOR IMPROVING BALANCE ON ONE LEG: A NEUROIMAGING AND BIOMECHANICS STUDY. THE ONE-LEG STANCE IS FREQUENTLY USED IN BALANCE TRAINING AND REHABILITATION PROGRAMS FOR VARIOUS BALANCE DISORDERS. THERE ARE SOME TYPICAL ONE-LEG STANCE POSTURES IN TAI CHI (TC) AND YOGA, WHICH ARE NORMALLY USED FOR IMPROVING BALANCE. HOWEVER, THE MECHANISM IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. BESIDES, THE DIFFERENCES OF ONE-LEG STANCE POSTURES BETWEEN TC AND YOGA IN TRAINING BALANCE ARE STILL UNKNOWN. THEREFORE, THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE CORTICAL ACTIVATION AND RAMBLING AND TREMBLING TRAJECTORIES TO ELUCIDATE THE POSSIBLE MECHANISM OF IMPROVING ONE-LEG STANCE BALANCE, AND COMPARE THE POSTURAL DEMANDS DURING ONE-LEG STANCE POSTURES BETWEEN TC AND YOGA. THIRTY-TWO HEALTHY YOUNG INDIVIDUALS WERE RECRUITED TO PERFORM TWO TC ONE-LEG STANCE POSTURES, I.E., RIGHT HEEL KICK (RHK) AND LEFT LOWER BODY AND STAND ON ONE LEG (LSOL), TWO YOGA POSTURES, I.E., ONE-LEG BALANCE AND TREE, AND NORMAL ONE-LEG STANDING (OLS). BRAIN ACTIVATION IN THE PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX, SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA (SMA), AND DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX (DLPFC) WAS MEASURED USING FUNCTIONAL NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY. THE CENTER OF PRESSURE WAS SIMULTANEOUSLY RECORDED USING A FORCE PLATFORM AND DECOMPOSED INTO RAMBLING AND TREMBLING COMPONENTS. ONE-WAY REPEATED-MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE WAS USED FOR THE MAIN EFFECTS. THE RELATIVE CONCENTRATION CHANGES OF OXYGENATED HEMOGLOBIN (DELTAHBO) IN SMA WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER DURING RHK, LSOL, AND TREE THAN THAT DURING OLS (P < 0.001). RHK (P < 0.001), LSOL (P = 0.003), AND TREE (P = 0.006) ALL SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER ROOT MEAN SQUARE RAMBLING (RMRMS) THAN THAT DURING OLS IN THE MEDIAL-LATERAL DIRECTION. THE RIGHT DLPFC ACTIVATION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER DURING THE RHK THAN THAT DURING THE TREE (P = 0.023), OLB (P < 0.001), AND OLS (P = 0.013) POSTURES. IN CONCLUSION, THE RHK, LSOL, AND TREE COULD BE USED AS TRAINING MOVEMENTS FOR PEOPLE WITH IMPAIRED BALANCE. FURTHERMORE, THE RHK IN TC MAY PROVIDE MORE COGNITIVE TRAINING IN POSTURAL CONTROL THAN TREE AND OLB IN YOGA. KNOWLEDGE FROM THIS STUDY COULD BE USED AND IMPLEMENTED IN TRAINING ONE-LEG STANCE BALANCE.	2021	

13   33  33 A 10-WEEK YOGA PRACTICE HAS NO EFFECT ON COGNITION, BUT IMPROVES BALANCE AND MOTOR LEARNING BY ATTENUATING BRAIN-DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR LEVELS IN OLDER ADULTS. DESPITE STUDIES INVESTIGATING THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON COGNITIVE AND MOTOR FUNCTIONING IN OLDER ADULTS, THE EFFECT ON DUAL-TASK PERFORMANCE AND MOTOR LEARNING AND THE SPECIFIC MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF YOGA REMAIN UNCLEAR. THUS, THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON COGNITION, BALANCE UNDER SINGLE- AND DUAL-TASK CONDITIONS, AND MOTOR LEARNING. THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF BRAIN-DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR (BDNF) IN INDUCED IMPROVEMENT WAS ALSO EXPLORED. PARTICIPANTS AGED 60-79YEARS WERE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER A CONTROL GROUP (N=15) OR A YOGA GROUP (N=18) FOR A 10-WEEK PERIOD. THE YOGA GROUP RECEIVED 90-MIN DURATION YOGA CLASSES TWO TIMES PER WEEK. CHANGES IN COGNITION, BALANCE UNDER SINGLE- AND DUAL-TASK CONDITIONS, AND LEARNING FAST AND ACCURATE REACHING MOVEMENTS WERE ASSESSED. YOGA PRACTICE DECREASED (P<0.05) THE VELOCITY VECTOR OF THE CENTER OF PRESSURE UNDER SINGLE- AND DUAL-TASK CONDITIONS, WHEREAS NO CHANGES IN COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE WERE OBSERVED. ALTHOUGH REACTION AND MOVEMENT TIMES DURING LEARNING WERE DECREASED IN BOTH GROUPS (P<0.05), A FASTER REACTION TIME (P<0.05) AND SHORTER MOVEMENT TIME (P<0.05) WERE OBSERVED IN THE YOGA GROUP THAN IN THE CONTROL GROUP. SIGNIFICANT MODERATE RELATIONSHIPS (P<0.05) BETWEEN CHANGES IN BDNF LEVELS AND FUNCTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS WERE OBSERVED. THUS, 10WEEKS OF YOGA PRACTICE RESULTED IN IMPROVED BALANCE AND LEARNING IN THE SPEED-ACCURACY MOTOR TASK THAT WERE MEDIATED BY INCREASED BDNF LEVELS, BUT HAD NO IMPACT ON COGNITION IN OLDER ADULTS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
14  747  23 EFFECT OF SAHAJA YOGA MEDITATION ON AUDITORY EVOKED POTENTIALS (AEP) AND VISUAL CONTRAST SENSITIVITY (VCS) IN EPILEPTICS. THE EFFECT OF SAHAJA YOGA MEDITATION ON 32 PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY IDIOPATHIC EPILEPSY ON REGULAR AND MAINTAINED ANTIEPILEPTIC MEDICATION WAS STUDIED. THE PATIENTS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO 3 GROUPS: GROUP I PRACTICED SAHAJA YOGA MEDITATION TWICE DAILY FOR 6 MONTHS UNDER PROPER GUIDANCE; GROUP II PRACTICED POSTURAL EXERCISES MIMICKING THE MEDITATION FOR THE SAME DURATION; AND GROUP III WAS THE CONTROL GROUP. VISUAL CONTRAST SENSITIVITY (VCS), AUDITORY EVOKED POTENTIALS (AEP), BRAINSTEM AUDITORY EVOKED POTENTIALS (BAEP), AND MID LATENCY RESPONSES (MLR) WERE RECORDED INITIALLY (0 MONTH) AND AT 3 AND 6 MONTHS FOR EACH GROUP. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN VCS FOLLOWING MEDITATION PRACTICE IN GROUP I PARTICIPANTS. NA, THE FIRST PROMINENT NEGATIVE PEAK OF MLR AND PA, THE POSITIVE PEAK FOLLOWING NA DID NOT REGISTER CHANGES IN LATENCY. THE NA-PA AMPLITUDE OF MLR ALSO SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE ABSOLUTE AND INTERPEAK LATENCIES OF BAEP. THE REDUCED LEVEL OF STRESS FOLLOWING MEDITATION PRACTICE MAY MAKE PATIENTS MORE RESPONSIVE TO SPECIFIC STIMULI. SAHAJA YOGA MEDITATION APPEARS TO BRING ABOUT CHANGES IN SOME OF THE ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES STUDIED IN EPILEPTIC PATIENTS.	2000	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
15 1986  26 SPATIAL AND VERBAL MEMORY TEST SCORES FOLLOWING YOGA AND FINE ARTS CAMPS FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN. THE PERFORMANCE SCORES OF CHILDREN (AGED 11 TO 16 YEARS) IN VERBAL AND SPATIAL MEMORY TESTS WERE COMPARED FOR TWO GROUPS (N = 30, EACH), ONE ATTENDING A YOGA CAMP AND THE OTHER A FINE ARTS CAMP. BOTH GROUPS WERE ASSESSED ON THE MEMORY TASKS INITIALLY AND AFTER TEN DAYS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE INTERVENTIONS. A CONTROL GROUP (N = 30) WAS SIMILARLY STUDIED TO ASSESS THE TEST-RETEST EFFECT. AT THE FINAL ASSESSMENT THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OF 43% IN SPATIAL MEMORY SCORES (MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS, TUKEY TEST), WHILE THE FINE ARTS AND CONTROL GROUPS SHOWED NO CHANGE. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA PRACTICE, INCLUDING PHYSICAL POSTURES, YOGA BREATHING, MEDITATION AND GUIDED RELAXATION IMPROVED DELAYED RECALL OF SPATIAL INFORMATION.	2004	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
16 1288  27 GREATER CORTICAL THICKNESS IN ELDERLY FEMALE YOGA PRACTITIONERS-A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY. YOGA, A MIND-BODY ACTIVITY THAT REQUIRES ATTENTIONAL ENGAGEMENT, HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH POSITIVE CHANGES IN BRAIN STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION, ESPECIALLY IN AREAS RELATED TO AWARENESS, ATTENTION, EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS AND MEMORY. NORMAL AGING, ON THE OTHER HAND, HAS ALSO BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL BRAIN CHANGES, BUT THESE GENERALLY INVOLVE DECREASED COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS. THE AIM OF THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS TO COMPARE BRAIN CORTICAL THICKNESS (CT) IN ELDERLY YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND A GROUP OF AGE-MATCHED HEALTHY NON-PRACTITIONERS. WE TESTED 21 OLDER WOMEN WHO HAD PRACTICED HATHA YOGA FOR AT LEAST 8 YEARS AND 21 WOMEN NAIVE TO YOGA, MEDITATION OR ANY MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS WHO WERE MATCHED TO THE FIRST GROUP IN AGE, YEARS OF FORMAL EDUCATION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY LEVEL. A T1-WEIGHTED MPRAGE SEQUENCE WAS ACQUIRED FOR EACH PARTICIPANT. YOGA PRACTITIONERS SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER CT IN A LEFT PREFRONTAL LOBE CLUSTER, WHICH INCLUDED PORTIONS OF THE LATERAL MIDDLE FRONTAL GYRUS, ANTERIOR SUPERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS AND DORSAL SUPERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS. WE FOUND GREATER CT IN THE LEFT PREFRONTAL CORTEX OF HEALTHY ELDERLY WOMEN WHO TRAINED YOGA FOR A MINIMUM OF 8 YEARS COMPARED WITH WOMEN IN THE CONTROL GROUP.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
17 1099  30 EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY ON POSTURAL STABILITY IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA-SPECTRUM DISORDERS: A SINGLE-BLIND RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: POSTURAL INSTABILITY IS A SERIOUS CONCERN IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA-SPECTRUM DISORDERS SINCE IT IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE THE RISK OF FALLS THAT MAY LEAD TO FRACTURES. THE IMPACT OF YOGA THERAPY ON POSTURAL STABILITY HAS NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED. METHODS: IN THIS EIGHT-WEEK SINGLE-BLIND RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY WITH AN EIGHT-WEEK FOLLOW-UP, OUTPATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA OR RELATED PSYCHOTIC DISORDER (ICD-10) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER YOGA THERAPY OR A CONTROL GROUP. IN THE YOGA THERAPY GROUP, THE SUBJECTS RECEIVED WEEKLY SESSIONS OF 60-MIN YOGA THERAPY FOR EIGHT WEEKS IN ADDITION TO THEIR ONGOING TREATMENT. IN THE CONTROL GROUP, THE SUBJECTS RECEIVED A WEEKLY REGULAR DAY-CARE PROGRAM. THE ASSESSMENTS THAT WERE PERFORMED AT THE BASELINE AND ENDPOINT INCLUDED THE CLINICAL STABILOMETRIC PLATFORM (CSP), ANTEFLEXION IN STANDING. RESULTS: FORTY-NINE PATIENTS PARTICIPATED IN THIS STUDY (32 MEN; MEAN +/- SD AGE, 53.1 +/- 12.3 YEARS): YOGA THERAPY GROUP (N = 25) AND CONTROL GROUP (N = 24). IN THE YOGA GROUP, SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE OBSERVED IN A TOTAL LENGTH OF TRUNK MOTION, THE ROMBERG RATIO, AND ANTEFLEXION IN STANDING AT WEEK 8 (MEAN +/- SD: 63.9 +/- 40.7-53.4 +/- 26.2 CM, 1.6 +/- 0.9-1.1 +/- 0.6, AND -8.7 +/- 9.5 TO -3.8 +/- 12.4 CM, RESPECTIVELY) WHILE THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE CONTROL GROUP. HOWEVER, THOSE CLINICAL GAINS RETURNED TO THE BASELINE LEVEL AT WEEK 16. CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS CONFIRMED THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF THE YOGA THERAPY ON POSTURAL STABILITY IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA. HOWEVER, THE THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS SEEMED TRANSIENT, WHICH WARRANTS FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS ON STRATEGIES TO SUSTAIN THE IMPROVEMENTS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
18 1970  30 SHORT TERM HEALTH IMPACT OF A YOGA AND DIET CHANGE PROGRAM ON OBESITY. BACKGROUND: OBESE PERSONS OFTEN FIND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY DIFFICULT. THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA AND DIET CHANGE PROGRAM, EMPHASIZING BREATHING TECHNIQUES PRACTICED WHILE SEATED, WAS ASSESSED IN OBESE PERSONS. MATERIAL/METHODS: A SINGLE GROUP OF 47 PERSONS WERE ASSESSED ON THE FIRST AND LAST DAY OF A YOGA AND DIET CHANGE PROGRAM, WITH 6 DAYS OF THE INTERVENTION BETWEEN ASSESSMENTS. THE ASSESSMENTS WERE: BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), WAIST AND HIP CIRCUMFERENCES, MID-ARM CIRCUMFERENCE, BODY COMPOSITION, HAND GRIP STRENGTH, POSTURAL STABILITY, SERUM LIPID PROFILE AND FASTING SERUM LEPTIN LEVELS. PARTICIPANTS PRACTICED YOGA FOR 5 HOURS EVERY DAY AND HAD A LOW FAT, HIGH FIBER, VEGETARIAN DIET. LAST AND FIRST DAY DATA WERE COMPARED USING A T-TEST FOR PAIRED DATA. RESULTS: FOLLOWING THE 6-DAY RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM, PARTICIPANTS SHOWED A DECREASE IN BMI (1.6 PERCENT), WAIST AND HIP CIRCUMFERENCES, FAT-FREE MASS, TOTAL CHOLESTEROL (7.7 PERCENT DECREASE), HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (HDL) CHOLESTEROL (8.7 PERCENT DECREASE), FASTING SERUM LEPTIN LEVELS (44.2 PERCENT DECREASE) AND AN INCREASE IN POSTURAL STABILITY AND HAND GRIP STRENGTH (P<0.05, ALL COMPARISONS). CONCLUSIONS: A 6-DAY YOGA AND DIET CHANGE PROGRAM DECREASED THE BMI AND THE FAT-FREE MASS. TOTAL CHOLESTEROL ALSO DECREASED DUE TO REDUCED HDL LEVELS. THIS SUGGESTS THAT A BRIEF, INTENSIVE YOGA PROGRAM WITH A CHANGE IN DIET CAN POSE CERTAIN RISKS. BENEFITS SEEN WERE BETTER POSTURAL STABILITY, GRIP STRENGTH (THOUGH A 'PRACTICE EFFECT' WAS NOT RULED OUT), REDUCED WAIST AND HIP CIRCUMFERENCES AND A DECREASE IN SERUM LEPTIN LEVELS.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
19 1301  35 HATHA YOGA ON BODY BALANCE. BACKGROUND: A GOOD BODY BALANCE REQUIRES A PROPER FUNCTION OF VESTIBULAR, VISUAL, AND SOMATOSENSORY SYSTEMS WHICH CAN BE REACH WITH EXERCISE PRACTICE AND/OR YOGA. AIM: TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF A 5-MONTH HATHA YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM ON BODY BALANCE IN YOUNG ADULTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS STUDY USED A CONTROLLED, NONRANDOMIZED DESIGN, WHERE THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP UNDERWENT A 5-MONTH TRAINING PROGRAM AND WERE THEN COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP THAT HAD A SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE. A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF 34 OUT OF 40 MEN AGED 25-55 YEARS OLD (34.0 +/- 0.9) WERE DEEMED ELIGIBLE FOR THIS STUDY. THEY WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUPS. SUBJECTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WERE ENGAGED IN 60 MIN SESSIONS OF HATHA YOGA THREE TIMES A WEEK FOR 5 MONTHS. WE EVALUATED POSTURAL CONTROL BY MEASURING THE LIMIT OF STABILITY AND VELOCITY OF OSCILLATION (VOS) IN THREE CONDITIONS OF THE BALANCE REHABILITATION UNIT (BRU) AND THROUGH FIELD PROCEDURES (FOUR POSITION, PLANE, FLAMINGO, HOPSCOTCH, AND DYNAMIC TEST). RESULTS: WE OBSERVED DIFFERENCES (P < 0.05) IN POSTINTERVENTION SCORES BETWEEN THE GROUPS REGARDLESS OF BRU PARAMETERS AND FIELD PROCEDURES (EXCEPT FOR FLAMINGO) EVEN AFTER ADJUSTING FOR PREINTERVENTION SCORES, SUGGESTING THAT THESE CHANGES WERE INDUCED BY HATHA YOGA TRAINING. THE PARTIAL ETA SQUARED ON BRU PARAMETERS RANGED FROM 0.78 (VOS1)-0.97 (COP2), AND FROM 0.00 (FLAMINGO)-0.94 (FOUR POSITION) FOR THE FIELD PROCEDURES. CONCLUSIONS: OUR RESULTS PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE THAT POSTURAL CONTROL IN HEALTHY YOUNG ADULTS CAN BE IMPROVED THROUGH PRACTICING HATHA YOGA.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
20  626  39 DIFFERENCE IN MUSCLE ACTIVATION PATTERNS DURING HIGH-SPEED VERSUS STANDARD-SPEED YOGA: A RANDOMIZED SEQUENCE CROSSOVER STUDY. OBJECTIVES: TO COMPARE THE DIFFERENCE IN MUSCLE ACTIVATION BETWEEN HIGH-SPEED YOGA AND STANDARD-SPEED YOGA AND TO COMPARE MUSCLE ACTIVATION OF THE TRANSITIONS BETWEEN POSES AND THE HELD PHASES OF A YOGA POSE. DESIGN: RANDOMIZED SEQUENCE CROSSOVER TRIAL SETTING: A LABORATORY OF NEUROMUSCULAR RESEARCH AND ACTIVE AGING INTERVENTIONS: EIGHT MINUTES OF CONTINUOUS SUN SALUTATION B WAS PERFORMED, AT A HIGH SPEED VERSUS A STANDARD-SPEED, SEPARATELY. ELECTROMYOGRAPHY WAS USED TO QUANTIFY NORMALIZED MUSCLE ACTIVATION PATTERNS OF EIGHT UPPER AND LOWER BODY MUSCLES (PECTORALIS MAJOR, MEDIAL DELTOIDS, LATERAL HEAD OF THE TRICEPS, MIDDLE FIBERS OF THE TRAPEZIUS, VASTUS MEDIALIS, MEDIAL GASTROCNEMIUS, THORACIC EXTENSOR SPINAE, AND EXTERNAL OBLIQUES) DURING THE HIGH-SPEED AND STANDARD-SPEED YOGA PROTOCOLS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: DIFFERENCE IN NORMALIZED MUSCLE ACTIVATION BETWEEN HIGH-SPEED YOGA AND STANDARD-SPEED YOGA. RESULTS: NORMALIZED MUSCLE ACTIVITY SIGNALS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN ALL EIGHT MUSCLES DURING THE TRANSITION PHASES OF POSES COMPARED TO THE HELD PHASES (P<0.01). THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION BETWEEN SPEEDXPHASE; HOWEVER, GREATER NORMALIZED MUSCLE ACTIVITY WAS SEEN FOR HIGHSPEED YOGA ACROSS THE ENTIRE SESSION. CONCLUSIONS: OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT TRANSITIONS FROM ONE HELD PHASE OF A POSE TO ANOTHER PRODUCES HIGHER NORMALIZED MUSCLE ACTIVITY THAN THE HELD PHASES OF THE POSES AND THAT OVERALL ACTIVITY IS GREATER DURING HIGHSPEED YOGA THAN STANDARD-SPEED YOGA. THEREFORE, THE TRANSITION SPEED AND ASSOCIATED NUMBER OF POSES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHEN TARGETING SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS IN PERFORMANCE.	2017

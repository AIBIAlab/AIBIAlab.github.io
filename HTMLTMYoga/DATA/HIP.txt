1 1757 121 POSITION OF THE HIP IN YOGA. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS GROWING IN POPULARITY AS A FORM OF EXERCISE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. ORTHOPEDIC PATIENTS PARTICIPATE IN YOGA, YET LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE RANGES-OF-MOTION OF THE HIP WITHIN VARIOUS YOGA POSES. ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS ARE UNSURE ABOUT WHAT POTENTIAL POSITIONS THEIR PATIENTS ARE PLACING THEIR HIPS DURING A YOGA PRACTICE. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO QUANTIFY THE DEGREE OF HIP MOTION WITH COMMON YOGA POSES. METHODS: TWENTY HEALTHY, REGULAR PRACTITIONERS OF YOGA PERFORMED 11 DIFFERENT YOGA POSES IN A STANDARDIZED FASHION. MOTION ANALYSIS WAS USED TO CAPTURE RANGE-OF-MOTION OF THE HIP DURING EACH POSE. RESULTS: MANY YOGA POSES PUT THE HIP IN EXTREMES OF MOTION. POSES SUCH AS DOWNWARD DOG, FORWARD FOLD, SEATED TWIST, AND PIGEON STRESSED THE HIP IN FLEXION. WARRIOR 1, WARRIOR 2, CRESCENT LUNGE, PIGEON, AND TRIANGLE STRESSED THE HIP IN EXTENSION. EAGLE AND SEATED TWIST PUT THE HIP IN HIGHER ADDUCTION, WHILE HALF MOON, EAGLE, AND TRIANGLE PRODUCED MORE HIP INTERNAL ROTATION. CONCLUSION: MANY POSES WERE FOUND TO REACH EXTREMES OF HIP MOTION. THIS STUDY MAY HELP GUIDE THE ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON IN COUNSELING HIP ARTHROPLASTY AND HIP IMPINGEMENT PATIENTS ABOUT YOGA-RELATED ACTIVITY. BY KNOWING WHICH POSES POTENTIALLY STRESS THE HIP IN PARTICULAR PLANES OF MOTION, SURGEONS MAY BETTER INFORM THEIR PATIENTS WHO ARE RETURNING TO YOGA AFTER INJURY OR SURGERY.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
2  408  33 BIOMECHANICAL CHARACTERISTICS ON THE LOWER EXTREMITY OF THREE TYPICAL YOGA MANOEUVRES. THIS STUDY WAS AIMED AT EXPLORING THE BIOMECHANICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY AMONGST THREE TYPICAL YOGA MANOEUVRES. A TOTAL OF THIRTEEN EXPERIENCED FEMALE YOGA PRACTITIONERS WERE RECRUITED IN THE CURRENT STUDY; THEY WERE ALL CERTIFIED WITH THE YOGA ALLIANCE. A THREE-DIMENSIONAL MOTION CAPTURE SYSTEM WITH 10 CAMERAS COMBINED WITH FOUR SYNCHRONISED FORCE PLATES WAS USED TO COLLECT KINEMATICS OF THE LOWER EXTREMITY AND GROUND REACTIVE FORCE WHILST THE PARTICIPANTS PERFORMED THE CRESCENT LUNGE POSE, WARRIOR II POSE, AND TRIANGLE POSE. ONE-WAY REPEATED ANOVA WAS USED IN EXPLORING THE DIFFERENCES AMONGST THE THREE YOGA MOVEMENTS, AND THE SIGNIFICANCE WAS SET TO ALPHA < 0.05. THE TRIANGLE POSE PERFORMED THE LARGEST RANGE OF MOTION (ROM) OF THE HIP (90.5 DEGREES +/- 22.9 DEGREES ), KNEE (68.8 DEGREES +/- 23.1 DEGREES ), AND ANKLE (46.4 DEGREES +/- 11.3 DEGREES ) IN THE SAGITTAL PLANE AND THE HIP (54.8 DEGREES +/- 6.5 DEGREES ), KNEE (42.4 DEGREES +/- 12.8 DEGREES ), AND ANKLE (4.8 DEGREES +/- 1.7 DEGREES ) IN THE FRONTAL PLANE AMONGST THE THREE MANOEUVRES (P < 0.05). NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND FOR THE HIP AND ANKLE JOINT MOMENT AMONGST THE THREE MANOEUVRES (P > 0.05). KNEE JOINT TRAVELLED INTO 9.5 DEGREES OF EXTENSION AND SLIGHT ADDUCTION OF 1.94 DEGREES WHILST EXPRESSING THE LARGEST KNEE JOINT ADDUCTION MOMENTS (0.30 +/- 0.22 NM/KG) IN THE TRIANGLE POSE. THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE ANGULAR IMPULSE OF THE LOWER LIMB JOINTS INDICATED THAT THE HIP JOINT CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY THE MOST IN THE SAGITTAL AND FRONTAL PLANES OF THE THREE YOGA MANOEUVRES (P < 0.05), RANGING FROM 51.67% TO 70.56%. RESULTS INDICATED THAT TRIANGLE POSE MAY BE SUPERIOR TO THE OTHER TWO MANOEUVRES, WHICH IMPROVED HIP JOINT ROM, STRENGTH, AND DYNAMIC STABILITY. HOWEVER, KNEE INJURIES SUCH AS OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) SHOULD BE CONSIDERED BECAUSE OF THE LARGE KNEE EXTENSOR ANGLE AND ADDUCTOR MOMENTS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
3 2064  35 THE BIOMECHANICAL DEMANDS OF STANDING YOGA POSES IN SENIORS: THE YOGA EMPOWERS SENIORS STUDY (YESS). BACKGROUND: THE NUMBER OF OLDER ADULTS PARTICIPATING IN YOGA HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY IN RECENT YEARS; YET, THE PHYSICAL DEMANDS ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA PERFORMANCE HAVE NOT BEEN REPORTED. THE PRIMARY AIM OF THE YOGA EMPOWERS SENIORS STUDY (YESS) WAS TO USE BIOMECHANICAL METHODS TO QUANTIFY THE PHYSICAL DEMANDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF 7 COMMONLY-PRACTICED STANDING YOGA POSES IN OLDER ADULTS. METHODS: 20 AMBULATORY OLDER ADULTS (70.7+-3.8 YRS) ATTENDED 2 WEEKLY 60-MINUTE HATHA YOGA CLASSES FOR 32 WEEKS. THE LOWER-EXTREMITY NET JOINT MOMENTS OF FORCE (JMOFS), WERE OBTAINED DURING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE FOLLOWING POSES: CHAIR, WALL PLANK, TREE, WARRIOR II, SIDE STRETCH, CRESCENT, AND ONE-LEGGED BALANCE. REPEATED-MEASURE ANOVA AND TUKEY'S POST-HOC TESTS WERE USED TO IDENTIFY DIFFERENCES IN JMOFS AMONG THE POSES. ELECTROMYOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS WAS USED TO SUPPORT THE JMOF FINDINGS. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT MAIN EFFECT FOR POSE, AT THE ANKLE, KNEE AND HIP, IN THE FRONTAL AND SAGITTAL PLANES (P=0.00-0.03). THE CRESCENT, CHAIR, WARRIOR II, AND ONE-LEGGED BALANCE POSES GENERATED THE GREATEST AVERAGE SUPPORT MOMENTS. SIDE STRETCH GENERATED THE GREATEST AVERAGE HIP EXTENSOR AND KNEE FLEXOR JMOFS. CRESCENT PLACED THE HIGHEST DEMANDS ON THE HIP FLEXORS AND KNEE EXTENSORS. ALL OF THE POSES PRODUCED ANKLE PLANTAR-FLEXOR JMOFS. IN THE FRONTAL PLANE, THE TREE GENERATED THE GREATEST AVERAGE HIP AND KNEE ABDUCTOR JMOFS; WHEREAS WARRIOR II GENERATED THE GREATEST AVERAGE HIP AND KNEE ADDUCTOR JMOFS. WARRIOR II AND ONE-LEGGED BALANCE INDUCED THE LARGEST AVERAGE ANKLE EVERTOR AND INVERTOR JMOFS, RESPECTIVELY. THE ELECTROMYOGRAPHIC FINDINGS WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE JMOF RESULTS. CONCLUSIONS: MUSCULOSKELETAL DEMAND VARIED SIGNIFICANTLY ACROSS THE DIFFERENT POSES. THESE FINDINGS MAY BE USED TO GUIDE THE DESIGN OF EVIDENCE-BASED YOGA INTERVENTIONS THAT ADDRESS INDIVIDUAL-SPECIFIC TRAINING AND REHABILITATION GOALS IN SENIORS.

4 2328  26 TRUNK AND HIP MUSCLE ACTIVATION DURING YOGA POSES: DO SEX-DIFFERENCES EXIST? OBJECTIVE: TO COMPARE CORE ACTIVATION DURING YOGA BETWEEN MALES AND FEMALES. METHODS: SURFACE ELECTROMYOGRAPHY WAS USED TO QUANTIFY RECTUS ABDOMINIS (RA), ABDOMINAL OBLIQUES (AO), LUMBAR EXTENSORS (LE), AND GLUTEUS MAXIMUS (GMX) ACTIVATION DURING FOUR YOGA POSES. DATA WERE EXPRESSED AS 100% OF A MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY ISOMETRIC CONTRACTION. MIXED-MODEL 2X2 ANALYSES OF VARIANCE WITH REPEATED MEASURES WERE USED TO DETERMINE BETWEEN-SEX DIFFERENCES IN MUSCLE ACTIVITY. RESULTS: FEMALES GENERATED GREATER RA ACTIVITY THAN MALES DURING THE HIGH PLANK (P<0.0001) AND DOMINANT-SIDE WARRIOR 1 (P=0.017). THEY GENERATED GREATER AO (P<0.0001) AND GMX (P=0.004) ACTIVITY DURING THE HIGH PLANK (P<0.0001). NO BETWEEN-SEX EMG ACTIVITY DIFFERENCES EXISTED FOR THE CHAIR AND UPWARD FACING DOG. CONCLUSION: FINDINGS HAVE PROVIDED PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE FOR BETWEEN-SEX DIFFERENCES IN MUSCLE ACTIVATION DURING YOGA POSES. CLINICIANS SHOULD CONSIDER SUCH DIFFERENCES WHEN PRESCRIBING YOGA TO IMPROVE MUSCLE STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
5 2329  30 TRUNK AND HIP MUSCLE ACTIVATION DURING YOGA POSES: IMPLICATIONS FOR PHYSICAL THERAPY PRACTICE. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE AND COMPARE ACTIVATION OF CORE MUSCLES DURING YOGA TO TRADITIONAL BACK EXERCISES. METHODS: SURFACE ELECTROMYOGRAPHY WAS USED TO QUANTIFY ACTIVATION OF THE RECTUS ABDOMINIS (RA), ABDOMINAL OBLIQUES (AO), LUMBAR EXTENSORS (LE), AND GLUTEUS MAXIMUS (GMX) DURING FOUR YOGA POSES. DATA WERE EXPRESSED AS 100% OF A MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY ISOMETRIC CONTRACTION. SEPARATE ANALYSES OF VARIANCE WITH REPEATED MEASURES WERE USED TO COMPARE MUSCLE ACTIVITY ACROSS EACH EXERCISE. RESULTS: SUBJECTS GENERATED GREATER RA (P < 0.0001) AND AO (P < 0.0001) ACTIVITY DURING THE PLANK. THEY GENERATED GREATER AO ACTIVITY (P < 0.0001) DURING THE UPWARD-FACING DOG THAN THE CHAIR AND DOMINANT-SIDE WARRIOR 1. LE ACTIVITY WAS GREATEST (P < 0.0001) DURING THE CHAIR. GMX ACTIVITY WAS SIMILAR (P = 0.09) DURING ALL EXERCISES. CONCLUSION: YOGA POSES MAY HELP IMPROVE CORE ENDURANCE AND STRENGTH. CLINICIANS MAY USE THESE DATA WHEN DEVELOPING AND IMPLEMENTING AN EVIDENCE-BASED CORE EXERCISE PROGRAM FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO PREFER A YOGA TREATMENT STRATEGY.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
6  552  34 CORE MUSCLE FUNCTION DURING SPECIFIC YOGA POSES. OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL USE OF 11 YOGA POSES IN SPECIFIC TRAINING AND REHABILITATION PROGRAMS VIA EXAMINATION OF THE MUSCLE ACTIVATION PATTERNS IN SELECTED TRUNK AND HIP MUSCLES. DESIGN: REPEATED-MEASURES DESCRIPTIVE STUDY. SETTING: UNIVERSITY LABORATORY, US. PARTICIPANTS: THIRTY HEALTHY YOGA PRACTITIONERS WITH MORE THAN 3 MONTHS YOGA PRACTICE EXPERIENCE (MEAN AGE+/-SD, 32.0+/-12.3 Y; 8 M/22 F) PARTICIPATED. INTERVENTIONS: SURFACE ELECTROMYOGRAPHIC SIGNALS OF UPPER RECTUS ABDOMINIS, LOWER RECTUS ABDOMINIS, LONGISSIMUS THORACIS, EXTERNAL OBLIQUE ABDOMINIS AND GLUTEUS MAXIMUM MUSCLE WERE RECORDED IN 11 YOGA POSES: HALFWAY LIFT, FORWARD FOLD, DOWNWARD FACING DOG, UPWARD FACING DOG, HIGH PLANK, LOW PLANK, CHAIR, MOUNTAIN WITH ARMS DOWN, MOUNTAIN WITH ARMS UP, WARRIOR 1 (BOTH SIDES). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ROOT MEAN SQUARE VALUES OF EACH MUSCLE DURING EACH POSE, NORMALIZED BY THE MAXIMAL VOLUNTARY CONTRACTION. RESULTS: THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT MAIN EFFECTS OF POSE (P<.001) AND MUSCLE (P<.001), AND A SIGNIFICANT POSEXMUSCLE INTERACTION (P=.001). THE POST HOC ANALYSIS REVEALED UNIQUE PATTERNS FOR THE FIVE MUSCLES OF INTEREST FOR EACH OF THE 11 POSES (P<.024). CONCLUSIONS: VARIATIONS IN CORE MUSCLE FIRING PATTERNS DEPEND ON THE TRUNK AND PELVIC POSITIONS DURING THESE POSES. TRAINING PROGRAMS CAN BE DEVELOPED BY CHOOSING PARTICULAR POSES TO TARGET SPECIFIC CORE MUSCLES FOR ADDRESSING LOW BACK PAIN AND DECLINES IN PERFORMANCE. THE HIGH PLANK, LOW PLANK AND DOWNWARD FACING DOG POSES ARE EFFECTIVE FOR STRENGTHENING EXTERNAL OBLIQUE ABDOMINIS, CHAIR AND WARRIOR 1 POSES FOR TARGETING GLUTEUS MAXIMUM, AND CHAIR AND HALFWAY LIFT POSES FOR STRENGTHENING LONGISSIMUS THORACIS. AND THESE THREE MUSCLES COULD BE STRENGTHENED BY THE UPWARD FACING DOG POSE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
7  322  41 ANKLE MOTION IN COMMON YOGA POSES. BACKGROUND: MOTION OF THE ANKLE IS ESSENTIAL FOR MANY YOGA POSES. AN UNDERSTANDING OF RANGE OF ANKLE MOTION DURING TYPICAL YOGA POSES MAY HELP THE CLINICIAN TO UNDERSTAND EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF PATIENTS WHEN RETURNING FROM ANKLE SURGERY OR INJURY TO YOGA. METHODS: THE BIOMECHANICS OF TWENTY HEALTHY ACTIVE YOGIS WERE COLLECTED DURING SEVEN YOGA POSES THAT ARE COMMON WITHIN THEIR PRACTICES. MOTION CAPTURE AND FORCE PLATES WERE USED TO ASSESS THE RANGE OF MOTION AND JOINT MOMENTS OF THE ANKLE FOR EACH POSE. RESULTS: ALL POSES RESULTED IN PLANTARFLEXION AND EXTERNAL ROTATION MOMENTS AT THE ANKLE JOINTS. JOINT LOADING WAS HIGHEST IN SINGLE LEG POSES. THE ARC OF MOTION USED BY THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS IN THE POSES WAS 29 DEGREES OF SAGITTAL MOTION, 20 DEGREES OF FRONTAL MOTION AND 35 DEGREES OF TRANSVERSE MOTION. DISCUSSION: ANKLE MOTION WAS EVALUATED WHEN HEALTHY YOGIS PERFORM STANDARD POSES. THESE RESULTS MAY HELP IN DISCUSSION WITH PATIENTS REGARDING EXPECTED OUTCOMES AFTER ANKLE INJURY OR SURGERY.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
8 1546  22 LATE ANTERIOR PROSTHETIC HIP DISLOCATION DUE TO YOGA. THE POPULARITY OF YOGA AND THE PREVALENCE OF TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY (THA) HAVE SIMULTANEOUSLY INCREASED IN THE UNITED STATES. ACCORDINGLY, ONE CAN ASSUME THAT THE NUMBER OF THA PATIENTS PRACTICING YOGA HAS INCREASED. CERTAIN YOGA POSES REACH THE EXTREMES OF HIP RANGE OF MOTION, POTENTIALLY LEAVING PATIENTS VULNERABLE TO DISLOCATION. TO DATE, 2 CASES OF LATE POSTERIOR PROSTHETIC HIP DISLOCATIONS DURING YOGA HAVE BEEN REPORTED; HOWEVER, THERE HAVE BEEN NO REPORTS OF ANTERIOR PROSTHETIC HIP DISLOCATIONS. WE PRESENT ONE CASE OF LATE ANTERIOR PROSTHETIC HIP DISLOCATION DURING YOGA IN A PATIENT WHO UNDERWENT THA VIA THE DIRECT ANTERIOR APPROACH. PROSTHETIC HIP DISLOCATION DURING YOGA MAY BE A GROWING CONCERN. WE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THA PATIENTS TO SAFELY PRACTICE YOGA.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
9 2306  34 TRAINING BENEFITS AND INJURY RISKS OF STANDING YOGA APPLIED IN MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS: LOWER LIMB BIOMECHANICAL ANALYSIS. STANDING YOGA POSES STRENGTHEN A PERSON'S LEGS AND HELPS TO ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF MUSCULOSKELETAL REHABILITATION, BUT INADEQUATE EXERCISE PLANNING CAN CAUSE INJURIES. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED CHANGES IN THE ELECTROMYOGRAM AND JOINT MOMENTS OF FORCE (JMOFS) OF LOWER EXTREMITIES DURING COMMON STANDING YOGA POSES IN ORDER TO EXPLORE THE FEASIBILITY AND POSSIBLE INJURY RISK IN DEALING WITH MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS. ELEVEN YOGA INSTRUCTORS WERE RECRUITED TO EXECUTE FIVE YOGA POSES (CHAIR, TREE, WARRIOR 1, 2, AND 3). THE RESULTS REVEALED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN HIP, KNEE, AND ANKLE JMOFS AND VARYING DEGREES OF MUSCLE ACTIVATION AMONG THE POSES. AMONG THESE POSES, RECTUS FEMORIS MUSCLE ACTIVATION DURING THE CHAIR POSE WAS THE HIGHEST, WARRIOR 2 PRODUCED THE HIGHEST MUSCLE ACTIVATION IN THE VASTUS LATERALIS OF THE FRONT LIMB, WHILE WARRIOR 1 HAD THE HIGHEST MUSCLE ACTIVATION IN THE VASTUS MEDIALIS OF THE BACK LIMB. THEREFORE, ALL THREE POSES CAN POSSIBLY BE SUGGESTED AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION FOR QUADRICEPS STRENGTHENING. WARRIOR 1 WAS POSSIBLY SUGGESTED AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION IN ORDER TO REDUCE EXCESSIVE LATERAL OVERLOAD OF THE PATELLA, BUT THE POSSIBLE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF WARRIOR 2 WITH THE HIGHEST KNEE ADDUCTOR JMOF IN THE BACK LIMB COULD RAISE JOINT REACTION FORCES ACROSS THE MEDIAL CONDYLES. IN SINGLE-LEG BALANCE POSTURES, WARRIOR 3 HAD UNIQUE TRAINING EFFECTS ON THE HAMSTRING, AND IS THEREFORE SUGGESTED AS A PART OF HAMSTRING REHABILITATION EXERCISES. THE TREE POSE INDUCED LOW LOWER-EXTREMITY JMOFS AND A LOW LEVEL OF THIGH MUSCLE ACTIVATIONS WHEN IT WAS PERFORMED BY SENIOR INSTRUCTORS WITH EXCELLENT BALANCE CONTROL; HOWEVER, FOR YOGA BEGINNERS WITH INSUFFICIENT STABILITY, IT WILL BE A USEFUL TRAINING MODE FOR STRENGTHENING THE MUSCLES THAT HELP TO KEEP ONE UPRIGHT. THIS STUDY QUANTIFIED THE PHYSICAL DEMANDS OF YOGA POSES USING BIOMECHANICAL DATA AND ELUCIDATED THE STRUCTURES AND PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING EACH YOGA MOVEMENT. THIS IS CRUCIAL FOR YOGA PRACTITIONERS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
10 1547  20 LATE TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY DISLOCATION DUE TO YOGA. YOGA HAS BECOME A POPULAR FORM OF EXERCISE, RECREATION, AND MEDITATION FOR ADULTS IN THE UNITED STATES. AS THE POPULARITY OF BOTH YOGA AND THE INCIDENCE OF HIP REPLACEMENTS HAVE BOTH COINCIDENTALLY INCREASED OVER THE LAST 2 DECADES, WE IMAGINE THAT THE NUMBER OF TOTAL HIP REPLACEMENT PATIENTS PARTAKING IN THE PRACTICE OF YOGA HAS ALSO INCREASED. THERE ARE NO CLEAR GUIDELINES AVAILABLE FOR YOGA PRACTICE FOLLOWING HIP REPLACEMENT. TO DATE, THERE HAVE BEEN NO PUBLISHED REPORTS OF PROSTHETIC HIP DISLOCATIONS DURING YOGA. WE PRESENT 2 CASES OF LATE TOTAL HIP DISLOCATIONS DURING YOGA AND PROVIDE A REVIEW OF THE AVAILABLE ORTHOPAEDIC LITERATURE AND OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ON PATIENT RESTRICTIONS AND EDUCATION WITH RESPECT TO PRACTICING YOGA AFTER A HIP REPLACEMENT.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
11 1741  29 PHYSICAL DEMAND PROFILES OF HATHA YOGA POSTURES PERFORMED BY OLDER ADULTS. UNDERSTANDING THE PHYSICAL DEMANDS PLACED UPON THE MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM BY INDIVIDUAL POSTURES MAY ALLOW EXPERIENCED INSTRUCTORS AND THERAPISTS TO DEVELOP SAFE AND EFFECTIVE YOGA PROGRAMS WHICH REDUCE UNDESIRABLE SIDE EFFECTS. THUS, WE USED BIOMECHANICAL METHODS TO QUANTIFY THE LOWER EXTREMITY JOINT ANGLES, JOINT MOMENTS OF FORCE, AND MUSCLE ACTIVITIES OF 21 HATHA YOGA POSTURES, COMMONLY USED IN SENIOR YOGA PROGRAMS. TWENTY OLDER ADULTS, 70.7 YEARS +/- 3.8 YEARS, PARTICIPATED IN A 32-WK YOGA CLASS (2 D/WK) WHERE THEY LEARNED INTRODUCTORY AND INTERMEDIATE POSTURES (ASANAS). THEY THEN PERFORMED THE ASANAS IN A MOTION ANALYSIS LABORATORY. KINEMATIC, KINETIC, AND ELECTROMYOGRAPHIC DATA WAS COLLECTED OVER THREE SECONDS WHILE THE PARTICIPANTS HELD THE POSES STATICALLY. PROFILES ILLUSTRATING THE POSTURES AND INCLUDING THE BIOMECHANICAL DATA WERE THEN GENERATED FOR EACH ASANA. OUR FINDINGS DEMONSTRATED THAT HATHA YOGA POSTURES ENGENDERED A RANGE OF APPRECIABLE JOINT ANGLES, JMOFS, AND MUSCLE ACTIVITIES ABOUT THE ANKLE, KNEE, AND HIP, AND THAT DEMANDS ASSOCIATED WITH SOME POSTURES AND POSTURE MODIFICATIONS WERE NOT ALWAYS INTUITIVE. THEY ALSO DEMONSTRATED THAT ALL OF THE POSTURES ELICITED APPRECIABLE RECTUS ABDOMINIS ACTIVITY, WHICH WAS UP TO 70% OF THAT INDUCED DURING WALKING.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
12  197  20 A RARE CASE OF QUADRATUS FEMORIS MUSCLE RUPTURE AFTER YOGA EXERCISES. WE PRESENT A CASE OF A FEMALE PATIENT WITH LEFT GROIN PAIN AFTER INTENSE YOGA EXERCISES. THE PATIENT PRESENTED ABNORMAL PATTERN OF GAIT WITH NO SWELLING OVER THE GROIN, THIGH, OR BUTTOCK. MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING DEMONSTRATED A TEAR OF THE QUADRATUS FEMORIS MUSCLE WITH AN ASSOCIATED EXTENSIVE HEMATOMA FORMATION. PATIENT WAS TREATED WITH A REHABILITATION PROGRAM CONSISTING OF NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS AND PHYSIOTHERAPY. AT THE FOLLOW-UP CONTROL, THE PATIENT HAD IMPROVED HER PAIN AND FLEXIBILITY OF THE HIP, AND GRADUALLY SHE RETURNED TO DAILY ACTIVITIES AND YOGA EXERCISES. SUCH AN ENTITY IS A RARE CAUSE OF HIP PAIN AFTER EXERCISE AND SHOULD BE KEPT IN MIND BY THE ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON, IN CASES OF GLUTEAL PAIN AFTER INTENSE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. MOREOVER, SUCH A CONDITION SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE DIAGNOSTIC ALGORITHM OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN HIP PAIN.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
13 1970  22 SHORT TERM HEALTH IMPACT OF A YOGA AND DIET CHANGE PROGRAM ON OBESITY. BACKGROUND: OBESE PERSONS OFTEN FIND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY DIFFICULT. THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA AND DIET CHANGE PROGRAM, EMPHASIZING BREATHING TECHNIQUES PRACTICED WHILE SEATED, WAS ASSESSED IN OBESE PERSONS. MATERIAL/METHODS: A SINGLE GROUP OF 47 PERSONS WERE ASSESSED ON THE FIRST AND LAST DAY OF A YOGA AND DIET CHANGE PROGRAM, WITH 6 DAYS OF THE INTERVENTION BETWEEN ASSESSMENTS. THE ASSESSMENTS WERE: BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), WAIST AND HIP CIRCUMFERENCES, MID-ARM CIRCUMFERENCE, BODY COMPOSITION, HAND GRIP STRENGTH, POSTURAL STABILITY, SERUM LIPID PROFILE AND FASTING SERUM LEPTIN LEVELS. PARTICIPANTS PRACTICED YOGA FOR 5 HOURS EVERY DAY AND HAD A LOW FAT, HIGH FIBER, VEGETARIAN DIET. LAST AND FIRST DAY DATA WERE COMPARED USING A T-TEST FOR PAIRED DATA. RESULTS: FOLLOWING THE 6-DAY RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM, PARTICIPANTS SHOWED A DECREASE IN BMI (1.6 PERCENT), WAIST AND HIP CIRCUMFERENCES, FAT-FREE MASS, TOTAL CHOLESTEROL (7.7 PERCENT DECREASE), HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (HDL) CHOLESTEROL (8.7 PERCENT DECREASE), FASTING SERUM LEPTIN LEVELS (44.2 PERCENT DECREASE) AND AN INCREASE IN POSTURAL STABILITY AND HAND GRIP STRENGTH (P<0.05, ALL COMPARISONS). CONCLUSIONS: A 6-DAY YOGA AND DIET CHANGE PROGRAM DECREASED THE BMI AND THE FAT-FREE MASS. TOTAL CHOLESTEROL ALSO DECREASED DUE TO REDUCED HDL LEVELS. THIS SUGGESTS THAT A BRIEF, INTENSIVE YOGA PROGRAM WITH A CHANGE IN DIET CAN POSE CERTAIN RISKS. BENEFITS SEEN WERE BETTER POSTURAL STABILITY, GRIP STRENGTH (THOUGH A 'PRACTICE EFFECT' WAS NOT RULED OUT), REDUCED WAIST AND HIP CIRCUMFERENCES AND A DECREASE IN SERUM LEPTIN LEVELS.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
14 2801  22 YOGA THERAPY IN AN INDIVIDUAL WITH SPINAL CORD INJURY: A CASE REPORT. NO KNOWN RESEARCH ADDRESSES THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN THOSE WITH SPINAL CORD INJURY (SCI), YET YOGA HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE MANY IMPAIRMENTS COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH SCI. THIS CASE REPORT DOCUMENTS THE OUTCOMES OF A YOGA PROGRAM IN AN INDIVIDUAL WITH AN SCI. THE PARTICIPANT WAS A 59-YEAR-OLD MALE WHO SUSTAINED AN INCOMPLETE C3-C6 SCI. HE PRACTICED HATHA YOGA FOR 60-MIN SESSIONS, TWICE PER WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS AND DESPITE NEUROLOGICAL INJURY, WAS ABLE TO COMPLETE A YOGA PROGRAM WITH MODIFICATIONS. IMPROVEMENTS WERE NOTED IN BALANCE; ENDURANCE; FLEXIBILITY; POSTURE; MUSCLE STRENGTH OF THE HIP EXTENSORS, HIP ABDUCTORS AND KNEE EXTENSORS; AND IN PERFORMANCE OF FUNCTIONAL GOALS. NO CHANGES WERE NOTED IN GAIT VELOCITY, SATISFACTION IN PERFORMANCE OF GOALS OR IN OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE. THE PARTICIPANT WAS ABLE TO PRACTICE YOGA EVEN THOUGH HE USED AN ASSISTIVE DEVICE TO WALK.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
15 1327  37 HIGH RATE OF RETURN TO YOGA FOR ATHLETES AFTER HIP ARTHROSCOPY FOR FEMOROACETABULAR IMPINGEMENT SYNDROME. BACKGROUND: FEMOROACETABULAR IMPINGEMENT SYNDROME (FAIS) IS MOST COMMONLY DIAGNOSED IN PATIENTS WHO PERFORM ACTIVITIES THAT REQUIRE REPETITIVE HIP FLEXION AND ROTATIONAL LOADING. YOGA IS AN ACTIVITY GROWING IN POPULARITY THAT INVOLVES THESE MOTIONS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE PATIENTS' ABILITY TO RETURN TO YOGA AFTER HIP ARTHROSCOPY FOR FAIS. HYPOTHESIS: THERE WOULD BE A HIGH RATE OF RETURN TO YOGA AFTER HIP ARTHROSCOPY. STUDY DESIGN: RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: LEVEL 4. METHODS: CONSECUTIVE PATIENTS WITH FAIS WHO HAD IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES AS PARTICIPATING IN YOGA AND HAD UNDERGONE HIP ARTHROSCOPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF FAIS BETWEEN 2012 AND 2015 WERE REVIEWED. DEMOGRAPHIC DATA WERE COLLECTED AND ASSESSED FOR ALL PATIENTS, AS WELL AS PREOPERATIVE PHYSICAL EXAMINATION, IMAGING, AND PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOME (PRO) SCORES, INCLUDING THE MODIFIED HARRIS HIP SCORE (MHHS), HIP OUTCOME SCORE ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING (HOS-ADL) AND SPORTS-SPECIFIC (HOS-SS) SUBSCALES, AND VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS) FOR PAIN. POSTOPERATIVELY, EXAMINATION AND PRO DATA WERE COLLECTED AT A MINIMUM 1 YEAR AFTER SURGERY, INCLUDING A YOGA-SPECIFIC QUESTIONNAIRE. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 42 PATIENTS (90% FEMALE; MEAN AGE, 35 +/- 9 YEARS; MEAN BODY MASS INDEX, 23.1 +/- 3.2 KG/M(2)) WERE INCLUDED. THIRTY PATIENTS (71%) HAD TO DISCONTINUE THEIR YOGA ROUTINE PREOPERATIVELY BECAUSE OF HIP-RELATED SYMPTOMS AT A MEAN 9.5 +/- 8.2 MONTHS BEFORE SURGERY. AFTER SURGERY, 39 PATIENTS (93%) WERE ABLE TO RETURN TO YOGA AT A MEAN 5.3 +/- 2.2 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY. TWO OF THE 3 PATIENTS WHO DID NOT RETURN TO YOGA NOTED LOSS OF INTEREST AS THEIR REASON FOR STOPPING, WHILE 1 PATIENT WAS UNABLE TO RETURN BECAUSE OF PERSISTENT HIP PAIN. NINETEEN PATIENTS (45%) RETURNED TO A HIGHER LEVEL OF YOGA PRACTICE, 17 PATIENTS (40%) RETURNED TO THE SAME LEVEL, AND 3 PATIENTS (7%) RETURNED TO A LOWER LEVEL. THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN THE NUMBER OF HOURS SPENT PRACTICING YOGA PER WEEK PRE- AND POSTOPERATIVELY (2.7 +/- 1.9 VS 2.5 +/- 1.3 HOURS; P = 0.44). ALL PATIENTS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ALL PROS AS WELL AS PAIN SCORES AFTER SURGERY (HOS-ADL, 67.4 +/- 18.3 TO 93.1 +/- 6.9 [ P < 0.001]; HOS-SS, 45.6 +/- 24.7 TO 81.5 +/- 18.8 [ P < 0.001]; MHHS, 62.3 +/- 11.3 TO 86.8 +/- 12.3 [ P < 0.0001]; VAS PAIN, 6.3 +/- 2.2 TO 0.90 +/- 1.1 [ P < 0.001]). CONCLUSION: PATIENTS PARTICIPATING IN YOGA RETURN TO YOGA 93% OF THE TIME AND AT A MEAN 5.3 +/- 2.2 MONTHS AFTER HIP ARTHROSCOPY FOR FAIS. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: INFORMATION REGARDING SURGICAL OUTCOMES IS CRITICAL IN COUNSELING PATIENTS, PARTICULARLY FEMALE ATHLETES, ON THEIR EXPECTATIONS WITH RESPECT TO RETURNING TO YOGA AFTER HIP ARTHROSCOPY FOR FAIS.	2018	

16   58  29 A COMPARISON OF EMG OUTPUT OF FOUR LOWER EXTREMITY MUSCLES DURING SELECTED YOGA POSTURES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO USE SURFACE ELECTROMYOGRAPHY (EMG) ANALYSIS TO EXAMINE THE MUSCLE ACTIVATION OF THE ANTERIOR TIBIALIS (TA), GASTROCNEMIUS (GA), RECTUS FEMORIS (RF) AND BICEPS FEMORIS (BF) MUSCLES DURING SEVERAL YOGA POSES: TREE POSE (VRKSASHANA), HALF MOON POSE (ARDHA CHANDRASANA) AND WARRIOR III (VIRABADRASANA) WHEN COMPARED TO A REST POSE (MOUNTAIN POSE). TEN HEALTHY FEMALES WITH MORE THAN 3 MONTHS OF CONTINUOUS YOGA EXPERIENCE WHO PRACTICED AT LEAST 1.5H PER WEEK WERE RECRUITED. EMG ACTIVITY WAS RECORDED FROM THE AFOREMENTIONED MUSCLES DURING MOUNTAIN POSE ("REST") FOR 30S, THREE TIMES. SUBJECTS THEN PERFORMED THE FOLLOWING YOGA POSES IN A RANDOMIZED SEQUENCE WHILE SURFACE EMG ACTIVITY WAS RECORDED: TREE POSE, HALF-MOON, AND WARRIOR III. EACH POSE WAS HELD FOR 20S TO 30S AND PERFORMED THREE TIMES. EMG DATA WERE BAND PASS FILTERED AND THE ROOT MEAN SQUARE (RMS) WAS OBTAINED. THE PEAK RMS OF EACH OF THE RESTING TRIALS WAS OBTAINED AND AVERAGED TO PRODUCE AN AVERAGE PEAK RESTING RMS VALUE. THE STUDY REVEALED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER EMG ACTIVITY IN TA AND GA IN ALL THREE POSES WHEN COMPARED TO BF AND RF. BF PRODUCED GREATER EMG ACTIVITY THAN RF IN WARRIOR III. IN CONCLUSION, SINGLE LIMB YOGA POSES REQUIRE INCREASED USE OF THE ANKLE MUSCULATURE WHEN COMPARED TO THIGH MUSCULATURE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
17 1348  27 IDENTIFYING YOGA-BASED KNEE STRENGTHENING EXERCISES USING THE KNEE ADDUCTION MOMENT. BACKGROUND: THIS STUDY AIMED TO COMPARE MUSCLE ACTIVATIONS, CO-CONTRACTION INDICES, AND THE KNEE ADDUCTION MOMENT BETWEEN STATIC STANDING YOGA POSTURES TO IDENTIFY APPROPRIATE EXERCISES FOR KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS. METHODS: HEALTHY YOUNG WOMEN (24.4 (5.4) YEARS, 23.1 (3.7) KG/M(2)) PARTICIPATED. PRIMARY OUTCOME VARIABLES WERE ELECTROMYOGRAPHIC ACTIVATIONS OF THE VASTUS LATERALIS, RECTUS FEMORIS, VASTUS MEDIALIS, BICEPS FEMORIS, AND SEMITENDINOSUS; CO-CONTRACTION BETWEEN THE BICEPS FEMORIS AND RECTUS FEMORIS, AND VASTUS LATERALIS AND VASTUS MEDIALIS; AND KNEE ADDUCTION MOMENTS OF BOTH LEGS DURING SIX STATIC, STANDING YOGA POSTURES (TWO SQUATTING POSTURES, TWO LUNGING POSTURES, A HAMSTRING STRETCH, AND A SINGLE-LEG BALANCE POSTURE). A TWO-FACTOR REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE WAS USED TO IDENTIFY DIFFERENCES IN MUSCLE AMPLITUDES, CO-CONTRACTIONS, AND KNEE ADDUCTION MOMENT BETWEEN POSTURES AND LEGS. FINDINGS: QUADRICEPS ACTIVATIONS WERE HIGHEST DURING SQUAT AND LUNGE POSTURES (P</=0.001). HAMSTRING ACTIVATIONS WERE HIGHEST DURING THE HAMSTRING STRETCH (P</=0.003). SQUAT AND LUNGE POSTURES PRODUCED HIGHER CO-CONTRACTION INDICES THAN OTHER POSTURES (P</=0.011). THE WIDE LEGGED SQUAT (GODDESS) AND LUNGE WITH TRUNK UPRIGHT (WARRIOR) PRODUCED THE LOWEST KNEE ADDUCTION MOMENTS (P</=0.006), WHILE THE SINGLE-LEG BALANCE POSTURE ELICITED A HIGHER KNEE ADDUCTION MOMENT THAN ALL OTHER POSTURES (P<0.05). INTERPRETATION: SQUATTING AND LUNGING POSTURES COULD IMPROVE LEG STRENGTH WHILE POTENTIALLY MINIMIZING EXPOSURE TO HIGH KNEE ADDUCTION MOMENTS. FUTURE WORK SHOULD EVALUATE WHETHER THESE EXERCISES ARE USEFUL IN PEOPLE WITH KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
18 1991  25 SPINE FUSIONS, YOGA INSTRUCTORS, AND HIP FRACTURES: THE ROLE OF DUAL MOBILITY IN PRIMARY TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY. BACKGROUND: DESPITE THE INCREASED USE OF DUAL MOBILITY (DM) IN PRIMARY TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY (THA), DEBATE EXISTS REGARDING THE INDICATIONS FOR ITS USE. NO SPECIFIC ALGORITHM EXISTS TO GUIDE THIS DECISION-MAKING PROCESS. THEREFORE, THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO SUMMARIZE THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE LITERATURE REGARDING THE USE OF DM IN PRIMARY THA AND PROVIDE EVIDENCE-BASED GUIDELINES BASED ON SPECIFIC PATIENT POPULATIONS AND RISK FACTORS FOR INSTABILITY. METHODS: WE REVIEWED THE CURRENT LITERATURE FOR STUDIES EVALUATING RISK FACTORS FOR DISLOCATION IN PRIMARY THA, AS WELL AS THE CLINICAL USE AND RESULTS OF DM IN PRIMARY THA. BASED ON THE STRENGTH OF THE LITERATURE, WE DISCUSS THE USE OF DM IN SPECIFIC PATIENT POPULATIONS. WE PROVIDE A DECISION-MAKING ALGORITHM TO DETERMINE WHETHER A PATIENT MAY BE INDICATED FOR DM IN PRIMARY THA. RESULTS: SURGEONS SHOULD CONSIDER PREOPERATIVE PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS, RISK FACTORS FOR INSTABILITY (EG, SIGNIFICANT HIP-SPINE ISSUES), TYPE OF PROCEDURE TO BE PERFORMED (EG, CONVERSION ARTHROPLASTY), AND INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY (EG, THA FOR FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE). BASED ON THIS ALGORITHMIC ASSESSMENT, DM MAY BE WARRANTED IN THE PRIMARY THA SETTING IF A PATIENT'S COMBINED RISK REACHES AN ESTABLISHED THRESHOLD BASED ON THE LITERATURE. CONCLUSION: THIS EVIDENCE-BASED ALGORITHM MAY HELP GUIDE CURRENT PRACTICE IN THE USE OF DM IN PRIMARY THA. WE ADVOCATE THE CONTINUED JUDICIOUS USE OF DM IN HIP ARTHROPLASTY. LONGER TERM STUDIES ARE NEEDED IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE DURABILITY OF DM, AS WELL AS ANY COMPLICATIONS RELATED TO THE DM ARTICULATION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
19  626  23 DIFFERENCE IN MUSCLE ACTIVATION PATTERNS DURING HIGH-SPEED VERSUS STANDARD-SPEED YOGA: A RANDOMIZED SEQUENCE CROSSOVER STUDY. OBJECTIVES: TO COMPARE THE DIFFERENCE IN MUSCLE ACTIVATION BETWEEN HIGH-SPEED YOGA AND STANDARD-SPEED YOGA AND TO COMPARE MUSCLE ACTIVATION OF THE TRANSITIONS BETWEEN POSES AND THE HELD PHASES OF A YOGA POSE. DESIGN: RANDOMIZED SEQUENCE CROSSOVER TRIAL SETTING: A LABORATORY OF NEUROMUSCULAR RESEARCH AND ACTIVE AGING INTERVENTIONS: EIGHT MINUTES OF CONTINUOUS SUN SALUTATION B WAS PERFORMED, AT A HIGH SPEED VERSUS A STANDARD-SPEED, SEPARATELY. ELECTROMYOGRAPHY WAS USED TO QUANTIFY NORMALIZED MUSCLE ACTIVATION PATTERNS OF EIGHT UPPER AND LOWER BODY MUSCLES (PECTORALIS MAJOR, MEDIAL DELTOIDS, LATERAL HEAD OF THE TRICEPS, MIDDLE FIBERS OF THE TRAPEZIUS, VASTUS MEDIALIS, MEDIAL GASTROCNEMIUS, THORACIC EXTENSOR SPINAE, AND EXTERNAL OBLIQUES) DURING THE HIGH-SPEED AND STANDARD-SPEED YOGA PROTOCOLS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: DIFFERENCE IN NORMALIZED MUSCLE ACTIVATION BETWEEN HIGH-SPEED YOGA AND STANDARD-SPEED YOGA. RESULTS: NORMALIZED MUSCLE ACTIVITY SIGNALS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN ALL EIGHT MUSCLES DURING THE TRANSITION PHASES OF POSES COMPARED TO THE HELD PHASES (P<0.01). THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION BETWEEN SPEEDXPHASE; HOWEVER, GREATER NORMALIZED MUSCLE ACTIVITY WAS SEEN FOR HIGHSPEED YOGA ACROSS THE ENTIRE SESSION. CONCLUSIONS: OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT TRANSITIONS FROM ONE HELD PHASE OF A POSE TO ANOTHER PRODUCES HIGHER NORMALIZED MUSCLE ACTIVITY THAN THE HELD PHASES OF THE POSES AND THAT OVERALL ACTIVITY IS GREATER DURING HIGHSPEED YOGA THAN STANDARD-SPEED YOGA. THEREFORE, THE TRANSITION SPEED AND ASSOCIATED NUMBER OF POSES SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHEN TARGETING SPECIFIC IMPROVEMENTS IN PERFORMANCE.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
20 2741  33 YOGA PRACTICE FOR REDUCING THE MALE OBESITY AND WEIGHT RELATED PSYCHOLOGICAL DIFFICULTIES-A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: OBESITY IS A HEALTH DISORDER AND INCREASING ALL OVER THE WORLD. IT IS ALSO A CAUSE FOR MANY NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. YOGA PRACTICE REDUCES THE STRESS LEVEL WHICH MAY IMPROVE THE EATING HABITS AND HELP IN WEIGHT REDUCTION. AIM: TO ASSESS THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THE EFFECTS AFTER 3 MONTHS OF THE 14 WEEKS YOGA TRAINING ON OBESITY OF ADULT MALE IN AN URBAN SETTING. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS WAS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH PARALLEL GROUPS (YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS) ON MALE OBESE. TOTAL 80 SUBJECTS WITH BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) BETWEEN 25 TO 35 KG/CM(2) WERE ENROLLED AND RANDOMIZED INTO TWO EQUAL GROUPS IN WHICH 72 SUBJECTS (YOGA N = 37 AND CONTROL N=35) COMPLETED THE TRIAL. YOGA GROUP MEAN AGE +/- SD WAS 40.03+/-8.74 AND CONTROL GROUP MEAN AGE+/-SD WAS 42.20+/-12.06. A 14 WEEKS SPECIAL IAYT (INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY) YOGA TRAINING WAS GIVEN TO THE YOGA GROUP AND NO SPECIFIC ACTIVITY WAS GIVEN TO CONTROL GROUP. THE INTERIM RESULTS OF THIS STUDY AT 14 WEEKS WERE COVERED IN ANOTHER ARTICLE WHICH IS UNDER PROCESS. AFTER THE 14 WEEKS OF YOGA TRAINING THE YOGA GROUP WAS ASKED TO CONTINUE THE YOGA PRACTICE FOR THE NEXT 3 MONTHS AND THE CONTROL GROUP WAS NOT GIVEN ANY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. THE FINAL OUTCOME IS COVERED IN THIS PAPER. THE ASSESSMENTS WERE ANTHROPOMETRIC PARAMETERS OF BODY WEIGHT (WT), BMI (BODY MASS INDEX), MAC (MID-UPPER ARM CIRCUMFERENCES OF LEFT AND RIGHT ARM), WC (WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE), HC (HIP CIRCUMFERENCE), WHR (WAIST HIP RATIO), SKF (SKIN FOLD THICKNESS) OF BICEPS, TRICEPS, SUB SCAPULAR, SUPRAILIAC AND CUMULATIVE SKIN FOLD THICKNESS VALUE), PERCENTAGE BODY FAT BASED ON SKF AND PSYCHOLOGICAL QUESTIONNAIRES OF PSS (PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE) AND AAQW (ACCEPTANCE AND ACTION QUESTIONNAIRE FOR WEIGHT RELATED DIFFICULTY). ASSESSMENTS WERE TAKEN AFTER 3 MONTHS OF YOGA TRAINING, FOR BOTH YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS. WITHIN GROUP, BETWEEN GROUP AND CORRELATION ANALYSES WERE CARRIED OUT USING SPSS 21. RESULTS: IMPROVEMENT IN ANTHROPOMETRIC AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS SUCH AS WT, PERCENTAGE BODY FAT, PSS WERE OBSERVED IN THE FINAL OUTCOME. ALSO, SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS SUCH AS AAQW SCORE WERE LOST IN THE FINAL OUTCOME, COMPARED TO INTERIM RESULTS. CONCLUSION: THE YOGA PRACTICE IS EFFECTIVE FOR OBESITY CONTROL FOR ADULT MALE IN AN URBAN SETTING.	2016

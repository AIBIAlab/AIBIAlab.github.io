1 1460 130 INFLUENCE OF YOGA ON CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE AND ON MEDIATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CHANGES IN SLEEP AND CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE: A NATIONWIDE, MULTICENTER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA IN CANCER SURVIVORS. BACKGROUND: CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (CRF) OFTEN CO-OCCURS WITH SLEEP DISTURBANCE AND IS ONE OF THE MOST PERVASIVE TOXICITIES RESULTING FROM CANCER AND ITS TREATMENT. WE AND OTHER INVESTIGATORS HAVE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THAT YOGA THERAPY CAN IMPROVE SLEEP QUALITY IN CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS. NO NATIONWIDE MULTICENTER PHASE III RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) HAS INVESTIGATED WHETHER YOGA THERAPY IMPROVES CRF OR WHETHER IMPROVEMENTS IN SLEEP MEDIATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON CRF. WE EXAMINED THE EFFECT OF A STANDARDIZED, 4-WEEK, YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM (YOGA FOR CANCER SURVIVORS [YOCAS]) ON CRF AND WHETHER YOCAS-INDUCED CHANGES IN SLEEP MEDIATED CHANGES IN CRF AMONG SURVIVORS. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: FOUR HUNDRED TEN CANCER SURVIVORS WERE RECRUITED TO A NATIONWIDE MULTICENTER PHASE III RCT COMPARING THE EFFECT OF YOCAS TO STANDARD SURVIVORSHIP CARE ON CRF AND EXAMINING THE MEDIATING EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN SLEEP, STEMMING FROM YOGA, ON CHANGES IN CRF. CRF WAS ASSESSED BY THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL FATIGUE SYMPTOM INVENTORY. SLEEP WAS ASSESSED VIA THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX. BETWEEN- AND WITHIN-GROUP INTERVENTION EFFECTS ON CRF WERE ASSESSED BY ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE AND 2-TAILED T TEST, RESPECTIVELY. PATH ANALYSIS WAS USED TO EVALUATE MEDIATION. RESULTS: YOCAS PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN CRF COMPARED WITH PARTICIPANTS IN STANDARD SURVIVORSHIP CARE AT POST-INTERVENTION ( P < .01). IMPROVEMENTS IN OVERALL SLEEP QUALITY AND REDUCTIONS IN DAYTIME DYSFUNCTION (EG, EXCESSIVE NAPPING) RESULTING FROM YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY MEDIATED THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON CRF (22% AND 37%, RESPECTIVELY, BOTH P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: YOCAS IS EFFECTIVE FOR TREATING CRF AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS; 22% TO 37% OF THE IMPROVEMENTS IN CRF FROM YOGA THERAPY RESULT FROM IMPROVEMENTS IN SLEEP QUALITY AND DAYTIME DYSFUNCTION. ONCOLOGISTS SHOULD CONSIDER PRESCRIBING YOGA TO CANCER SURVIVORS FOR TREATING CRF AND SLEEP DISTURBANCE.	2019	
                                        
2 2550  37 YOGA FOR CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE IN SURVIVORS OF HEMATOPOIETIC CELL TRANSPLANTATION: A FEASIBILITY STUDY. CONTEXT: CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (CRF) IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON SYMPTOMS EXPERIENCED BY CANCER PATIENTS AFTER HEMATOPOIETIC CELL TRANSPLANTATION (HCT). YOGA IS AN APPROACH WITH SUPPORTIVE EVIDENCE TO IMPROVE CRF IN DIFFERENT CANCER POPULATIONS, BUT TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, IT HAS NOT BEEN TESTED IN AN ADULT HCT POPULATION. OBJECTIVES: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA INTERVENTION OFFERED TO ADULT HCT SURVIVORS WITH MODERATE-TO-SEVERE CRF. METHODS: THIS FEASIBILITY STUDY USED A SINGLE-ARM, PRETEST-POSTTEST DESIGN. ADULT HCT SURVIVORS WERE ENROLLED IN A SIX-WEEK RESTORATIVE YOGA INTERVENTION THAT CONSISTED OF A ONE-HOUR ONCE-WEEKLY CLASS WITH TWICE-WEEKLY HOME PRACTICE USING A DVD. RESULTS: TWENTY PARTICIPANTS (13 WOMEN AND SEVEN MEN) ENROLLED IN THIS STUDY WITH A MEAN AGE OF 51 YEARS (SD = 12.5). THE SAMPLE CONSISTED OF 19 ALLOGENEIC HCT SURVIVORS, SEVEN OF WHOM HAD A HISTORY OF ACUTE GRAFT-VS.-HOST DISEASE (GVHD), SIX WITH ACTIVE, EXTENSIVE CHRONIC GVHD, AND ONE AUTOLOGOUS HCT SURVIVOR. THE ACCRUAL ACCEPTANCE RATE WAS 23.2% (20/86 HCT SURVIVORS) AND RETENTION RATE WAS 60% (12/20). OVERALL ADHERENCE WAS 45.4%. NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT A RESTORATIVE YOGA INTERVENTION IN ADULT HCT SURVIVORS IS SAFE AND FEASIBLE. THE INCIDENCE OF GVHD MAY HAVE IMPACTED ADHERENCE. STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE ACCRUAL ACCEPTANCE, RETENTION, AND ADHERENCE ARE NEEDED.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
3 1608  34 META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS ON YOGA, PSYCHOSOCIAL, AND MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE: WHAT INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS ARE RELATED TO HIGHER EFFICACY? CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (CRF) IS A BURDENSOME SEQUELA OF CANCER TREATMENTS. BESIDES EXERCISE, RECOMMENDED THERAPIES FOR CRF INCLUDE YOGA, PSYCHOSOCIAL, AND MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS. HOWEVER, INTERVENTIONS CONDUCTED VARY WIDELY, AND NOT ALL SHOW A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT. THIS META-ANALYSIS AIMED TO EXPLORE INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS RELATED TO GREATER REDUCTIONS IN CRF. WE INCLUDED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS PUBLISHED BEFORE OCTOBER 2021. STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCES WERE USED TO ASSESS INTERVENTION EFFICACY FOR CRF AND MULTIMODEL INFERENCE TO EXPLORE INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER EFFICACY. FOR THE META-ANALYSIS, WE INCLUDED 70 INTERVENTIONS (24 YOGA INTERVENTIONS, 31 PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTIONS, AND 15 MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS) WITH 6387 PARTICIPANTS. THE RESULTS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF YOGA, PSYCHOSOCIAL, AND MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS ON CRF BUT WITH HIGH HETEROGENEITY BETWEEN STUDIES. FOR YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS, NO PARTICULAR INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTIC WAS IDENTIFIED TO BE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR REDUCING CRF. REGARDING PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTIONS, A GROUP SETTING AND WORK ON COGNITION WERE RELATED TO HIGHER INTERVENTION EFFECTS ON CRF. THE RESULTS OF THIS META-ANALYSIS SUGGEST OPTIONS TO MAXIMIZE THE INTERVENTION EFFECTS OF PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTIONS FOR CRF. THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR CRF APPEAR TO BE INDEPENDENT OF THEIR DESIGN, ALTHOUGH THE LIMITED NUMBER OF STUDIES POINTS TO THE NEED FOR FURTHER RESEARCH.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
4 2129  30 THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA ON CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION: THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA ON CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (CRF) IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY AND/OR RADIATION THERAPY. LITERATURE SEARCH: RELEVANT ENGLISH AND CHINESE ARTICLES WERE RETRIEVED FROM MEDICAL DATABASES AND INCLUDED IN THIS ANALYSIS. STANDARDIZED CRITICAL APPRAISAL INSTRUMENTS FROM THE JOANNA BRIGGS INSTITUTE WERE ADOPTED FOR THE QUALITY ASSESSMENT. DATA EVALUATION: 16 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. SYNTHESIS: YOGA INTERVENTIONS HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT IN REDUCING CRF AMONG PATIENTS UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY AND/OR RADIATION THERAPY, BUT THE ADHERENCE TO YOGA WAS LOW. MIXED TYPES OF YOGA, IN ADDITION TO SUPERVISED AND SELF-PRACTICING STRATEGIES, WERE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED PATIENT ADHERENCE AND IMPROVED CRF. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: YOGA APPEARS TO BE A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE EXERCISE FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF CRF DURING CHEMOTHERAPY AND/OR RADIATION THERAPY; HOWEVER, ADDITIONAL HIGH-QUALITY STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO DEFINE AN OPTIMAL YOGA INTERVENTION STRATEGY.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
5 2098  43 THE EFFECT OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. BACKGROUND: WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER (BC) ARE LIVING LONGER WITH DEBILITATING SIDE EFFECTS SUCH AS CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (CRF) THAT AFFECT OVERALL WELL-BEING. YOGA PROMOTES HEALTH, WELL-BEING AND MAY BE BENEFICIAL IN REDUCING CRF. ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN PREVIOUS SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND META-ANALYSES, THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CRF AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) REMAIN UNCLEAR, PARTICULARLY IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER TYPES OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (PA). OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO CARRY OUT A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CRF AND QOL IN WOMEN WITH BC. METHODS: ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE SEARCHED (MEDLINE, EMBASE CLASSIC+EMBASE AND EMB REVIEWS, COCHRANE CENTRAL CT) FROM INCEPTION TO MAY 2018. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE INCLUDED IF THEY WERE FULL TEXT, IN ENGLISH, INCLUDED A YOGA INTERVENTION, A COMPARATOR (INCLUDING NON-PA USUAL CARE OR ALTERNATE PA INTERVENTION), AND REPORTED ON CRF OR QOL. EFFECTS OF YOGA WERE POOLED USING STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE (SMD) VIA A RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL. RESULTS: OF THE 2468 RECORDS RETRIEVED, 24 TRIALS WERE INCLUDED; 18 STUDIES COMPARED YOGA TO A NON-PA COMPARATOR AND 6 TO A PA COMPARATOR. YOGA DEMONSTRATED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN CRF OVER NON-PA (SMD -0.30 [-0.51; -0.08]) BUT NOT PA (SMD -0.17 [-0.50; 0.17]) COMPARATORS. ADDITIONALLY, YOGA DEMONSTRATED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN QOL OVER NON-PA (SMD -0.27 [-0.46; -0.07]) BUT NOT PA (SMD 0.04 [-0.22; +0.31]) COMPARATORS. DISCUSSION: THIS META-ANALYSIS FOUND THAT YOGA PROVIDES SMALL TO MEDIUM IMPROVEMENTS IN CRF AND QOL COMPARED TO NON-PA, BUT NOT IN COMPARISON TO OTHER PA INTERVENTIONS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
6 2647  40 YOGA HAS A SOLID EFFECT ON CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER: A META-ANALYSIS. PURPOSE: THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO CRITICALLY EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. METHODS: EIGHT DATABASES (COCHRANE LIBRARY, PUBMED, OVID-MEDLINE, WEB OF SCIENCE, CBM, WANFANG, VIP, AND CNKI) WERE SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEWED FROM INCEPTION TO JANUARY 2019 FOR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS). TWO REVIEWERS CRITICALLY AND INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSED THE RISK OF BIAS USING COCHRANE COLLABORATION CRITERIA AND EXTRACTED CORRELATED DATA USING THE DESIGNED FORM. ALL ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED WITH REVIEW MANAGER 5.3. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 17 QUALIFIED STUDIES THAT INCLUDED 2183 PATIENTS (YOGA: 1112, CONTROL: 1071) WERE INCLUDED IN THE META-ANALYSIS. YOGA HAD A LARGE EFFECT ON FATIGUE IN POST-TREATMENT BREAST CANCER PATIENTS AND HAD A SMALL EFFECT ON INTRA-TREATMENT PATIENTS. THE META-ANALYSIS ALSO INDICATED THAT SUPERVISED YOGA CLASS HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON CRF; THE SIX-WEEK PROGRAM HAD A MODERATE BENEFICIAL EFFECT WHILE THE 60/90 MIN/SESSION SUPERVISED YOGA CLASS AND THE EIGHT-WEEK PROGRAM DEMONSTRATED A LARGE EFFECT ON FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. YOGA COULD MARKEDLY MITIGATE THE PHYSICAL FATIGUE IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS, HAD A MEDIUM IMPACT ON COGNITIVE FATIGUE, AND MANIFESTED A SMALL EFFECT ON MENTAL FATIGUE. EIGHT STUDIES REPORTED THE ADVERSE EVENTS, WHEREAS TEN STUDIES DID NOT. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA CAN BE CONSIDERED AS AN ALTERNATIVE THERAPY FOR RELIEVING FATIGUE IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WHO HAVE COMPLETED TREATMENT OR ARE UNDERGOING ANTI-CANCER TREATMENT.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
7 2382  55 YOCAS(C)(R) YOGA REDUCES SELF-REPORTED MEMORY DIFFICULTY IN CANCER SURVIVORS IN A NATIONWIDE RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL: INVESTIGATING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MEMORY AND SLEEP. UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND INTERVENTIONS ARE NEEDED TO ALLEVIATE MEMORY DIFFICULTY IN CANCER SURVIVORS. WE PREVIOUSLY SHOWED IN A PHASE III RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL THAT YOCAS(C)(R) YOGA-A PROGRAM THAT CONSISTS OF BREATHING EXERCISES, POSTURES, AND MEDITATION-SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED SLEEP QUALITY IN CANCER SURVIVORS. THIS STUDY ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF YOCAS(C)(R) ON MEMORY AND IDENTIFIED RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MEMORY AND SLEEP. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: SURVIVORS WERE RANDOMIZED TO STANDARD CARE (SC) OR SC WITH YOCAS(C)(R) . 328 PARTICIPANTS WHO PROVIDED DATA ON THE MEMORY DIFFICULTY ITEM OF THE MD ANDERSON SYMPTOM INVENTORY ARE INCLUDED. SLEEP QUALITY WAS MEASURED USING THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX. GENERAL LINEAR MODELING (GLM) DETERMINED THE GROUP EFFECT OF YOCAS(C)(R) ON MEMORY DIFFICULTY COMPARED WITH SC. GLM ALSO DETERMINED MODERATION OF BASELINE MEMORY DIFFICULTY ON POSTINTERVENTION SLEEP AND VICE VERSA. PATH MODELING ASSESSED THE MEDIATING EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN MEMORY DIFFICULTY ON YOCAS(C)(R) CHANGES IN SLEEP AND VICE VERSA. RESULTS: YOCAS(C)(R) SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED MEMORY DIFFICULTY AT POSTINTERVENTION COMPARED WITH SC (MEAN CHANGE: YOGA=-0.60; SC=-0.16; P<.05). BASELINE MEMORY DIFFICULTY DID NOT MODERATE THE EFFECTS OF POSTINTERVENTION SLEEP QUALITY IN YOCAS(C)(R) COMPARED WITH SC. BASELINE SLEEP QUALITY DID MODERATE THE EFFECTS OF POSTINTERVENTION MEMORY DIFFICULTY IN YOCAS(C)(R) COMPARED WITH SC (P<.05). CHANGES IN SLEEP QUALITY WAS A SIGNIFICANT MEDIATOR OF REDUCED MEMORY DIFFICULTY IN YOCAS(C)(R) COMPARED WITH SC (P<.05); HOWEVER, CHANGES IN MEMORY DIFFICULTY DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY MEDIATE IMPROVED SLEEP QUALITY IN YOCAS(C)(R) COMPARED WITH SC. CONCLUSIONS: IN THIS LARGE NATIONWIDE TRIAL, YOCAS(C)(R) YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED PATIENT-REPORTED MEMORY DIFFICULTY IN CANCER SURVIVORS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                        
8 2896  32 [EFFECT OF YOGA ON CANCER RELATED FATIGUE IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WITH CHEMOTHERAPY]. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE CONDITION OF CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (CRF) IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WITH CHEMOTHERAPY AND TO EXPLORE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON IT. METHODS: AFTER THE COMPLETION OF YOGA, 100 BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WITH CRF (CFS>0) WERE SELECTED AND WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO THE YOGA GROUP AND THE CONTROL GROUP (N=50). PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP ONLY RECEIVED ROUTINE CURE AND CARE WHILE PATIENTS IN THE YOGA GROUP RECEIVED EXTRA YOGA EXERCISE, LASTING FOR 4 MONTHS. CANCER FATIGUE SCALE (CFS) WAS EVALUATED IN THE 2ND, 4TH AND 6TH ROUND OF CHEMOTHERAPY. RESULTS: AT THE END, 82 CASES QUALIFIED FOR THE STUDY, 42 CASES FOR THE CONTROL GROUP AND 40 FOR THE YOGA GROUP. THE MEAN SCORE OF BODY FATIGUE WAS 12.67+/-3.46. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN CRF BETWEEN THE YAGO GROUP AND THE CONTROL GROUP BEFORE THE YOGA INTERVENTION (P>0.05). AFTER THE 4TH ROUND OF CHEMOTHERAPY, THE MEAN SCORES OF CFS AND BODY FATIGUE IN THE YOGA GROUP WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THAT IN THE CONTROL GROUP (P<0.05). AFTER THE 6TH ROUND OF CHEMOTHERAPY, THE MEAN SCORES OF CFS, BODY FATIGUE AND COGNITIVE FATIGUE IN THE YOGA GROUP WERE LOWER THAN THAT IN THE CONTROL GROUP (P<0.05). REPEATED ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE SHOWED THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN THE OVERALL FATIGUE, BODY FATIGUE AND COGNITIVE FATIGUE BETWEEN THE YOGA GROUP AND THE CONTROL GROUP WAS SIGNIFICANT (P<0.05); THE TIME INFLUENCE ON THE OVERALL FATIGUE, BODY FATIGUE AND EMOTIONAL FATIGUE WAS SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE 2 GROUPS (P<0.05); THERE WERE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE EFFECT OF YAGO AND TIME ON THE OVERALL FATIGUE, BODY FATIGUE AND COGNITIVE FATIGUE (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: THE BODY FATIGUE WAS MORE SERIOUS IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WITH CHEMOTHERAPY. YOGA INTERVENTION COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE BODY FATIGUE, COGNITIVE FATIGUE, THUS REDUCE THE OVERALL FATIGUE IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WITH CHEMOTHERAPY.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
9 1052  52 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE AND GLOBAL SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN IN OLDER CANCER SURVIVORS. BACKGROUND: SIXTY PERCENT OF CANCER SURVIVORS ARE 65YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER. CANCER AND ITS TREATMENTS LEAD TO CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE AND MANY OTHER SIDE EFFECTS, IN TURN, CREATING SUBSTANTIAL GLOBAL SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN (TOTAL BURDEN FROM ALL SIDE EFFECTS) WHICH, ULTIMATELY, COMPROMISES FUNCTIONAL INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY OF LIFE. VARIOUS MODES OF EXERCISE, SUCH AS YOGA, REDUCE CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE AND GLOBAL SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN IN YOUNGER CANCER SURVIVORS, BUT NO STUDIES HAVE SPECIFICALLY EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON OLDER CANCER SURVIVORS. OBJECTIVES: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF A 4-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION (YOGA FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: YOCAS(C)(R)) ON OVERALL CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, AND DUE TO ITS MULTIDIMENSIONAL NATURE, THE SUBDOMAINS OF CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (GENERAL, PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, AND MENTAL) AND GLOBAL SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN IN OLDER CANCER SURVIVORS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A SECONDARY ANALYSIS ON DATA FROM A MULTICENTER PHASE III RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL WITH 2 ARMS (STANDARD CARE AND STANDARD CARE PLUS A 4-WEEK YOCAS(C)(R) INTERVENTION). THE SAMPLE FOR THIS SECONDARY ANALYSIS WAS 97 OLDER CANCER SURVIVORS (>/=60YEARS OF AGE), BETWEEN 2MONTHS AND 2YEARS POST-TREATMENT, WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE ORIGINAL TRIAL. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOCAS(C)(R) INTERVENTION ARM REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, PHYSICAL FATIGUE, MENTAL FATIGUE, AND GLOBAL SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN THAN PARTICIPANTS IN THE STANDARD CARE ARM FOLLOWING THE 4-WEEK INTERVENTION PERIOD (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: YOCAS(C)(R) IS AN EFFECTIVE STANDARDIZED YOGA INTERVENTION FOR REDUCING CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, PHYSICAL FATIGUE, MENTAL FATIGUE, AND GLOBAL SIDE-EFFECT BURDEN AMONG OLDER CANCER SURVIVORS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
10  478  43 CLINICAL CASE REPORT: YOGA FOR FATIGUE IN FIVE YOUNG ADULT SURVIVORS OF CHILDHOOD CANCER. PURPOSE: CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (CRF) IS A DISTRESSING CONSEQUENCE OF CANCER AND ITS TREATMENT. CRF IMPACTS MANY YOUNG ADULT (YA) SURVIVORS OF CHILDHOOD CANCER, COMPROMISING WORK, SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND DAILY ACTIVITIES. NO SATISFACTORY TREATMENT EXISTS. THIS PILOT STUDY AIMED TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY, SAFETY, AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF AN 8-WEEK TWICE/WEEK IYENGAR YOGA (IY) INTERVENTION FOR TREATING PERSISTENT FATIGUE IN YA SURVIVORS OF CHILDHOOD CANCER. METHODS: USING A SINGLE-ARM MIXED-METHODS DESIGN, ADULT CHILDHOOD CANCER SURVIVORS AGED BETWEEN 18 AND 39 YEARS WERE RECRUITED FROM A SURVIVORSHIP CLINIC AT A SINGLE INSTITUTION. QUANTITATIVE: THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS FATIGUE AS MEASURED BY THE FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CHRONIC ILLNESS THERAPY-FATIGUE. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED VITALITY, SOCIAL FUNCTIONING, MULTIDIMENSIONAL FATIGUE, MOOD, AND SLEEP. WEEKLY SELF-REPORT MONITORING DATA WERE COLLECTED. QUALITATIVE: PARTICIPANTS ALSO COMPLETED A POST-INTERVENTION INTERVIEW, MAJOR THEMES EVALUATED. RESULTS: FIVE PARTICIPANTS ENROLLED INTO THE STUDY AND FOUR COMPLETED THE INTERVENTION. ATTENDANCE WAS 92% AND THERE WERE NO ADVERSE EVENTS. BASELINE MOBILITY WAS HIGHLY VARIED, WITH ONE YA HAVING HAD A HEMIPELVECTOMY. QUANTITATIVE DATA REVEALED SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED FATIGUE, SOCIAL FUNCTIONING, SOMATIZATION, AND GENERAL AND EMOTIONAL MANIFESTATIONS OF FATIGUE FOLLOWING YOGA. QUALITATIVE DATA CROSS VALIDATED, CLARIFIED, AND EXPANDED UPON THE QUANTITATIVE FINDINGS. CONCLUSIONS: THE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT A BRIEF IY INTERVENTION IS SAFE FOR YA SURVIVORS OF CHILDHOOD CANCER, EVEN FOR THOSE WITH PHYSICAL DISABILITIES. PRELIMINARY EFFICACY WAS DEMONSTRATED FOR THE PRIMARY OUTCOME OF FATIGUE. QUALITATIVE DATA ELUCIDATED ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS, SUCH AS WORK-RELATED SOCIAL FUNCTIONING, AND A SENSE OF CALM AND RELAXATION.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
11 1061  38 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY, PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: YOGA RECEIVE MORE ATTENTION FROM BREAST CANCER PATIENTS, HOWEVER ITS FEASIBILITY AND EFFICACY DURING CHEMOTHERAPY REMAINS CONFLICTING. WE PERFORMED THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY, PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY. METHODS: A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED TO RETRIEVE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) WHICH INVESTIGATED THE COMPARATIVE EFFICACY OF YOGA VERSUS COMPARATORS SUCH AS USUAL CARE AMONG BREAST CANCER PATIENTS FOR HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY, PHYSICAL HEALTH AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH IN PUBMED, EMBASE, COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CNETRAL), NURSING AND ALLIED HEALTH LITERATURE (CINAHL), CHINESE BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE (CBM) DATABASE, CHINA SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY JOURNAL (CSTJ) DATABASE, CHINA NATIONAL KNOWLEDGE INFRASTRUCTURE (CNKI), AND WANGFANG DATABASE FROM INCEPTION TO DECEMBER 2018. THE LATEST SEARCH WAS UPDATED ON SEPTEMBER 2020. ALL ANALYSES WERE COMPLETED USING REVMAN VERSION 5.3. RESULTS: SEVEN TRIALS INVOLVING 693 BREAST CANCER PATIENTS MET INCLUSION CRITERIA. META-ANALYSIS INDICATED A SHORT-TERM IMPROVEMENT IN FATIGUE [STANDARD MEAN DIFFERENCE (SMD), -0.62; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI), -1.17 TO -0.07], SLEEP DISTURBANCE (SMD, -0.34; 95% CI, -0.55 TO -0.12), DEPRESSION (SMD, -0.50; 95% CI, -0.70 TO -0.31) ANXIETY (SMD, -0.50; 95% CI, -0.70 TO -0.31), AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) (SMD, 0.72; 95% CI, -0.12 TO 1.56) IN THE YOGA GROUP; HOWEVER BENEFICIAL MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS IN FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCE WERE NOT IDENTIFIED. MOREOVER, QUALITATIVE ANALYSES SUGGESTED THAT YOGA WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED ADVERSE EVENTS (AES) COMPARED WITH CONTROL GROUPS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA MAY BENEFIT TO REDUCE FATIGUE, DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, IMPROVE SLEEP DISTURBANCE, AND IMPROVE QOL IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY IN THE SHORT-TERM; HOWEVER, MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS SHOULD BE FURTHER ESTABLISHED OWING TO LIMITATIONS.	2021	

12 2093  48 THE EFFECT OF YOCAS(C)(R) YOGA FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS ON HORMONAL THERAPY. UP TO 50% OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS ON AROMATASE INHIBITOR THERAPY REPORT MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS SUCH AS JOINT AND MUSCLE PAIN, SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTING TREATMENT ADHERENCE AND DISCONTINUATION RATES. WE CONDUCTED A SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS OF A NATIONWIDE, MULTI-SITE, PHASE II/III RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED, CLINICAL TRIAL EXAMINING THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR IMPROVING MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS CURRENTLY RECEIVING HORMONE THERAPY (AROMATASE INHIBITORS [AI] OR TAMOXIFEN [TAM]). BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS CURRENTLY RECEIVING AI (N = 95) OR TAM (N = 72) WITH NO PARTICIPATION IN YOGA DURING THE PREVIOUS 3 MONTHS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO 2 ARMS: (1) STANDARD CARE MONITORING AND (2) STANDARD CARE PLUS THE 4-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION (2X/WEEK; 75 MIN/SESSION) AND INCLUDED IN THIS ANALYSIS. THE YOGA INTERVENTION UTILIZED THE UR YOGA FOR CANCER SURVIVORS (YOCAS(C)((R))) PROGRAM CONSISTING OF BREATHING EXERCISES, 18 GENTLE HATHA AND RESTORATIVE YOGA POSTURES, AND MEDITATION. MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS WERE ASSESSED PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION. AT BASELINE, AI USERS REPORTED HIGHER LEVELS OF GENERAL PAIN, MUSCLE ACHES, AND TOTAL PHYSICAL DISCOMFORT THAN TAM USERS (ALL P </= 0.05). AMONG ALL BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS ON HORMONAL THERAPY, PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP DEMONSTRATED GREATER REDUCTIONS IN MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS SUCH AS GENERAL PAIN, MUSCLE ACHES AND TOTAL PHYSICAL DISCOMFORT FROM PRE- TO POST-INTERVENTION THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (ALL P </= 0.05). THE SEVERITY OF MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS WAS HIGHER FOR AI USERS COMPARED TO TAM USERS. AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS ON HORMONE THERAPY, THE BRIEF COMMUNITY-BASED YOCAS(C)(R) INTERVENTION SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED GENERAL PAIN, MUSCLE ACHES, AND PHYSICAL DISCOMFORT.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
13 1650  53 MULTICENTER, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA FOR SLEEP QUALITY AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS. PURPOSE: THIRTY PERCENT TO 90% OF CANCER SURVIVORS REPORT IMPAIRED SLEEP QUALITY POST-TREATMENT, WHICH CAN BE SEVERE ENOUGH TO INCREASE MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS EXERCISE, ARE RECOMMENDED IN CONJUNCTION WITH DRUGS AND COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF IMPAIRED SLEEP. PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT YOGA-A MIND-BODY PRACTICE AND FORM OF EXERCISE-MAY IMPROVE SLEEP AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS. THE PRIMARY AIM OF THIS RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF A STANDARDIZED YOGA INTERVENTION COMPARED WITH STANDARD CARE FOR IMPROVING GLOBAL SLEEP QUALITY (PRIMARY OUTCOME) AMONG POST-TREATMENT CANCER SURVIVORS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: IN ALL, 410 SURVIVORS SUFFERING FROM MODERATE OR GREATER SLEEP DISRUPTION BETWEEN 2 AND 24 MONTHS AFTER SURGERY, CHEMOTHERAPY, AND/OR RADIATION THERAPY WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO STANDARD CARE OR STANDARD CARE PLUS THE 4-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. THE YOGA INTERVENTION USED THE YOGA FOR CANCER SURVIVORS (YOCAS) PROGRAM CONSISTING OF PRANAYAMA (BREATHING EXERCISES), 16 GENTLE HATHA AND RESTORATIVE YOGA ASANAS (POSTURES), AND MEDITATION. PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED TWO 75-MINUTE SESSIONS PER WEEK. SLEEP QUALITY WAS ASSESSED BY USING THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX AND ACTIGRAPHY PRE- AND POSTINTERVENTION. RESULTS: IN ALL, 410 SURVIVORS WERE ACCRUED (96% FEMALE; MEAN AGE, 54 YEARS; 75% HAD BREAST CANCER). YOGA PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN GLOBAL SLEEP QUALITY AND, SECONDARILY, SUBJECTIVE SLEEP QUALITY, DAYTIME DYSFUNCTION, WAKE AFTER SLEEP ONSET, SLEEP EFFICIENCY, AND MEDICATION USE AT POSTINTERVENTION (ALL P </= .05) COMPARED WITH STANDARD CARE PARTICIPANTS. CONCLUSION: YOGA, SPECIFICALLY THE YOCAS PROGRAM, IS A USEFUL TREATMENT FOR IMPROVING SLEEP QUALITY AND REDUCING SLEEP MEDICATION USE AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
14 2627  30 YOGA FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF CANCER TREATMENT-RELATED TOXICITIES. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: TO (1) EXPLAIN WHAT YOGA IS, (2) SUMMARIZE PUBLISHED LITERATURE ON THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR MANAGING CANCER TREATMENT-RELATED TOXICITIES, (3) PROVIDE CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE USE OF YOGA FOR ONCOLOGY PROFESSIONALS, AND (4) SUGGEST PROMISING AREAS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. RECENT FINDINGS: BASED ON A TOTAL OF 24 PHASE II AND ONE PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS, LOW-INTENSITY FORMS OF YOGA, SPECIFICALLY GENTLE HATHA AND RESTORATIVE, ARE FEASIBLE, SAFE, AND EFFECTIVE FOR TREATING SLEEP DISRUPTION, CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, PSYCHOSOCIAL DISTRESS, AND MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS IN CANCER PATIENTS RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIATION AND CANCER SURVIVORS. CLINICIANS SHOULD CONSIDER PRESCRIBING YOGA FOR THEIR PATIENTS SUFFERING WITH THESE TOXICITIES BY REFERRING THEM TO QUALIFIED YOGA PROFESSIONALS. MORE DEFINITIVE PHASE III CLINICAL TRIALS ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE FINDINGS AND TO INVESTIGATE OTHER TYPES, DOSES, AND DELIVERY MODES OF YOGA FOR TREATING CANCER-RELATED TOXICITIES IN PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
15 1065  38 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER: A META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. BACKGROUND: COMPLICATIONS OF BREAST CANCER TREATMENT CAN CAUSE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL DISTRESS IN PATIENTS. YOGA DEMONSTRATES SUBSTANTIAL POTENTIAL AS A SUPPORTIVE THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. OUR AIM IS TO CONDUCT A META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN ENHANCING THE QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) OF PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. METHODS: WE SEARCHED FOR STUDIES PUBLISHED BEFORE MARCH 2020 IN THE PUBMED, EMBASE, AND COCHRANE LIBRARY DATABASES. INDIVIDUAL EFFECT SIZES WERE STANDARDIZED, AND THE POOLED EFFECT SIZE WAS CALCULATED USING A RANDOM EFFECT MODEL. MEASURED OUTCOMES INCLUDED QOL, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, STRESS, FATIGUE, PAIN SEVERITY, AND SLEEP QUALITY. RESULTS: IN TOTAL, 26 TRIALS INVOLVING 2069 PATIENTS WERE REVIEWED. SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENT IN QOL WAS OBSERVED IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE YOGA INTERVENTION. THE POOLED MEAN DIFFERENCES IN SOCIAL (WEIGHTED MEAN DIFFERENCE [WMD]: 1.36, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI] 0.12-2.61), EMOTIONAL (WMD: 1.46, 95% CI 0.26-2.66), AND FUNCTIONAL WELL-BEING (WMD: 2.04, 95% CI 0.21-3.87) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN THE YOGA GROUP THAN IN THE CONTROL GROUP. PATIENTS PRACTICING YOGA EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN PHYSICAL WELL-BEING, MENTAL WELL-BEING, AND SLEEP QUALITY AS WELL AS REDUCTIONS IN ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, STRESS, FATIGUE, AND PAIN SEVERITY AFTER THE INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA MAY ENHANCE QOL IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER EXPERIENCING POST-TREATMENT COMPLICATIONS. THEREFORE, WE RECOMMEND YOGA AS A SUPPORTIVE THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER TO RELIEVE POST-TREATMENT DISTRESS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
16 1865  49 RANDOMIZED PILOT TRIAL OF YOGA VERSUS STRENGTHENING EXERCISES IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WITH CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE. PURPOSE: FATIGUE IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON AND BOTHERSOME REFRACTORY SYMPTOMS EXPERIENCED BY CANCER SURVIVORS. MINDFUL EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS YOGA IMPROVE CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE; HOWEVER, STUDIES OF YOGA HAVE INCLUDED HETEROGENEOUS SURVIVORSHIP POPULATIONS, AND THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON FATIGUED SURVIVORS REMAINS UNCLEAR. METHODS: WE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED 34 EARLY-STAGE BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WITH CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (>/=4 ON A LIKERT SCALE FROM 1-10) WITHIN 1 YEAR FROM DIAGNOSIS TO A 12-WEEK INTERVENTION OF HOME-BASED YOGA VERSUS STRENGTHENING EXERCISES, BOTH PRESENTED ON A DVD. THE PRIMARY ENDPOINTS WERE FEASIBILITY AND CHANGES IN FATIGUE, AS MEASURED BY THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL FATIGUE SYMPTOM INVENTORY-SHORT FORM (MFSI-SF). SECONDARY ENDPOINT WAS QUALITY OF LIFE, ASSESSED BY THE FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CANCER THERAPIES-BREAST (FACT-B). RESULTS: WE INVITED 401 WOMEN TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY; 78 RESPONDED, AND WE ENROLLED 34. BOTH GROUPS HAD SIGNIFICANT WITHIN-GROUP IMPROVEMENT IN MULTIPLE DOMAINS OF THE FATIGUE AND QUALITY OF LIFE SCORES FROM BASELINE TO POST-INTERVENTION, AND THESE BENEFITS WERE MAINTAINED AT 3 MONTHS POST-INTERVENTION. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS IN FATIGUE OR QUALITY OF LIFE AT ANY ASSESSMENT TIME. SIMILARLY, THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS IN ADHERENCE TO THE EXERCISE INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: BOTH DVD-BASED YOGA AND STRENGTHENING EXERCISES DESIGNED FOR CANCER SURVIVORS MAY BE GOOD OPTIONS TO ADDRESS FATIGUE IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. BOTH HAVE REASONABLE UPTAKE, ARE CONVENIENT AND REPRODUCIBLE, AND MAY BE HELPFUL IN DECREASING FATIGUE AND IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE FIRST YEAR POST-DIAGNOSIS IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WITH CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
17 2365  36 WALKING IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN YOGA AT REDUCING SLEEP DISTURBANCE IN CANCER PATIENTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. THIS REVIEW AIMED TO DETERMINE WHETHER WALKING IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN YOGA AT IMPROVING SLEEP DISTURBANCE IN CANCER PATIENTS. A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WAS PERFORMED IN THE PUBMED, EMBASE, CINAHL, COCHRANE LIBRARY, CNKI, AIRITI LIBRARY, AND OTHER HEALTH-RELATED DATABASES. TWENTY-FIVE STUDIES WERE IDENTIFIED WITH A TOTAL OF 1918 PARTICIPANTS. THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX WAS THE MOST COMMONLY USED OUTCOME MEASUREMENT TOOL, AND MODERATE-INTENSITY WALKING WAS THE MOST FREQUENTLY USED INTERVENTION. THE MAJORITY OF THE INCLUDED SUBJECTS WERE BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. OVERALL, WALKING SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED SLEEP DISTURBANCE COMPARED TO YOGA (P = 0.01). STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT MODERATORS INCLUDED ADHERENCE RATE FOR WALKING (P < 0.001) AND ALLOCATION CONCEALMENT AND OUTCOME MEASUREMENT TOOL FOR YOGA (P = 0.04; P = 0.03). WE CONCLUDED THAT WALKING IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN YOGA IN IMPROVING SLEEP DISTURBANCE IN CANCER PATIENTS. THUS, MODERATE-INTENSITY WALKING IS RECOMMENDED FOR CANCER PATIENTS WITH SLEEP DISTURBANCE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
18 1077  36 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PSYCHOLOGIC FUNCTION AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER: A META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS META-ANALYSIS WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PSYCHOLOGIC FUNCTION AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER. DESIGN: A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH OF PUBMED, EMBASE, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, THE CHINESE BIOMEDICAL LITERATURE DATABASE, AND THE CHINESE DIGITAL JOURNALS FULL-TEXT DATABASE WAS CARRIED OUT. RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS (RCTS) EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA, VERSUS A CONTROL GROUP RECEIVING NO INTERVENTION, ON PSYCHOLOGIC FUNCTIONING AND QOL IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER WERE INCLUDED. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF INCLUDED RCTS WAS ASSESSED ACCORDING TO THE COCHRANE HANDBOOK FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF INTERVENTIONS 5.0.1, AND DATA WERE ANALYZED USING THE COCHRANE COLLABORATION'S REVIEW MANAGER 5.1. RESULTS: SIX (6) STUDIES INVOLVING 382 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED. THE META-ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT YOGA CAN IMPROVE QOL FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER. A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT FAVORING YOGA FOR THE OUTCOME OF QOL WAS FOUND (STANDARD MEAN DIFFERENCE=0.27, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [0.02, 0.52], P=0.03). ALTHOUGH THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PSYCHOLOGIC FUNCTION OUTCOMES--SUCH AS ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, DISTRESS AND SLEEP--WERE IN THE EXPECTED DIRECTION, THESE EFFECTS WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P>0.05). FATIGUE SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: THE PRESENT DATA PROVIDED LITTLE INDICATION OF HOW EFFECTIVE YOGA MIGHT BE WHEN THEY WERE APPLIED BY WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER EXCEPT FOR MILDLY EFFECTIVE IN QOL IMPROVEMENT. THE FINDINGS WERE BASED ON A SMALL BODY OF EVIDENCE IN WHICH METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY WAS NOT HIGH. FURTHER WELL-DESIGNED RCTS WITH LARGE SAMPLE SIZE ARE NEEDED TO CLARIFY THE UTILITY OF YOGA PRACTICE FOR THIS POPULATION.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
19 1108  34 EFFECTS OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ON CANCER-ASSOCIATED COGNITIVE DECLINE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: TO SUMMARIZE AND EVALUATE EVIDENCE AVAILABLE ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CANCER-ASSOCIATED COGNITIVE DECLINE (CACD). RECENT FINDINGS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED USING FOUR DATABASES OF ARTICLES PUBLISHED BEFORE JANUARY 1, 2020. TEN ARTICLES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA (SIX RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS, TWO SINGLE-ARM STUDIES, ONE NON-RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, AND ONE CASE SERIES STUDY). STUDIES WERE PREDOMINANTLY CONDUCTED WITH BREAST CANCER PATIENTS USING LOW-INTENSITY HATHA YOGA PROGRAMS. OF THE 10 ARTICLES, FIVE REPORTED SOME POSITIVE EFFECTS ON CACD, BUT SIGNIFICANT BIASES WERE POSSIBLE DUE TO DESIGN SHORTCOMINGS. COHEN'S D EFFECT SIZES RANGED FROM |0.03| TO |0.74|. THE EVIDENCE TO DATE IS INSUFFICIENT TO SUGGEST THAT YOGA IS BENEFICIAL FOR ATTENUATING CACD. MORE RIGOROUS TRIALS CONTROLLING FOR NON-SPECIFIC FACTORS ARE WARRANTED. THE FIELD WOULD ALSO BENEFIT FROM EXAMINING SELF-DELIVERED MODES OF YOGA FOR TREATING CACD IN VARIOUS CANCER POPULATIONS TO ENHANCE PRACTICE SUSTAINABILITY AND GENERALIZABILITY.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
20  206  25 A SELF-DIRECTED HOME YOGA PROGRAMME FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER DURING CHEMOTHERAPY: A FEASIBILITY STUDY. RECENT STUDIES SUGGEST YOGA AS A PROMISING APPROACH FOR IMPROVING THE COGNITIVE FUNCTION OF CANCER SURVIVORS. WE STUDIED WHETHER A SELF-DIRECTED HOME YOGA PROGRAMME WAS FEASIBLE FOR PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER WHO WERE UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY. PARTICIPANTS' PREFERENCES FOR THE TYPE OF YOGA COURSE AND THE CLINICAL EFFECTS OF THE PROGRAMME WERE ALSO ASSESSED. IN THIS STUDY, 18 WOMEN (MEAN AGE, 43.9 YEARS) WERE ENROLLED (44.7% RECRUITMENT RATE). OF THE PARTICIPANTS, 63.6% HAD STAGE II CANCER AND 71.4% RECEIVED ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY. FAVOURABLE RETENTION (86%), ADHERENCE (94.4%) AND ACCEPTABILITY (96.5%) RATES WERE DETERMINED. MOST (94.4%) OF THE WOMEN PRACTICED THE HOME PROGRAMME MORE THAN TWICE A WEEK ON AVERAGE. THE PARTICIPANTS PREFERRED TO GRADUALLY INCREASE THE INTENSITY OF THE EXERCISES. WE ONLY OBSERVED IMPROVEMENTS IN THE COGNITIVE ASPECTS OF FATIGUE. NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS WERE ENCOUNTERED DURING THE PROGRAMME. THIS SELF-DIRECTED HOME YOGA PROGRAMME WAS SAFE AND FEASIBLE FOR PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY.	2016

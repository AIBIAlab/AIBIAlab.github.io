1 2355 121 VALIDATION OF YOGA MODULE FOR CHILDREN WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES. BACKGROUND: CHILDREN WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES GENERALLY EXPERIENCE MORE PAIN THAN THE NORMAL CHILDREN DUE TO CHRONIC SYSTEMIC CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR DISABILITY. DESCRIPTION OF PAIN IS GENERALLY DIFFICULT IN CHILDREN AND MORE SO IN CHILDREN WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES (IDS). YOGA HAS BEEN REGARDED AS A KIND OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AS WELL AS A PAIN MANAGEMENT STRATEGY. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE REPORTED THE BENEFICIAL ROLE OF YOGA IN ENHANCING PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOMOTOR ABILITIES OF IDS; HOWEVER, A VALIDATED YOGA MODULE (YM) FOR IDS IS UNAVAILABLE. THE PRESENT STUDY IS AIMED AT DEVELOPING A VALIDATED YM FOR CHILDREN WITH IDS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE CONTENT VALIDITY OF YM FOR CHILDREN WITH IDS WAS ASSESSED BY A PANEL OF 22 EXPERIENCED YOGA EXPERTS. THE YM FOR CHILDREN WITH IDS WAS DEVELOPED IN THE FORM OF TAILOR-MADE YOGA PRACTICES THAT WERE SUPPORTED BY CLASSICAL TEXTS AND RESEARCH EVIDENCE. A TOTAL OF 32 PRACTICES WERE INCLUDED IN THE YM, AND EACH PRACTICE WAS DISCUSSED AND RATED AS (I) NOT ESSENTIAL, (II) USEFUL BUT NOT ESSENTIAL, AND (III) ESSENTIAL. THE CONTENT VALIDITITY RATIOWAS CALCULATED USING LAWSHE'S FORMULA. RESULTS: DATA ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT OUT OF 32 YM PRACTICES, 31 INDICATED SIGNIFICANT CONTENT VALIDITY (CUTOFF VALUE: 0.42, AS CALCULATED BY APPLYING LAWSHE'S FORMULA FOR THE CVR). CONCLUSIONS: THE PRESENT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THE YM FOR CHILDREN WITH IDS IS VALID WITH GOOD CONTENT VALIDITY. HOWEVER, FUTURE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS MUST DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFICACY OF THE DEVELOPED YM FOR CHILDREN WITH IDS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
2 2723  51 YOGA MODULE FOR SOMATOFORM PAIN DISORDERS: DEVELOPMENT, CONTENT VALIDATION, AND FEASIBILITY TESTING. BACKGROUND: YOGA PRACTICES HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE USEFUL IN CHRONIC PAIN CONDITIONS BUT STUDIES FOCUSSING SPECIFICALLY ON SOMATOFORM PAIN DISORDERS (SPDS) ARE LIMITED. AIMS: CURRENT STUDY AIMS TO DEVELOP AND TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA PROGRAM FOR PATIENTS WITH SPDS. MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY: ATHOROUGH SEARCH OF TRADITIONAL AND CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE WAS PERFORMED WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF FORMULATING A YOGA PROGRAM FOR REDUCING CHRONIC NON-SPECIFIC PAIN AND ASSOCIATED PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. CONTENT VALIDITY OF THE PROGRAM WAS THEN DETERMINED BY TAKING THE OPINION OF 18 YOGA EXPERTS (WHO HAD >5 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN TREATING MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS) USING CONTENT VALIDATION RATIO (CVR) THROUGH LAWSHE'S FORMULA. THE FEASIBILITY OF THE MODULE WAS TESTED ON 10 SUBJECTS DIAGNOSED WITH SPDS AS PER THE INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES (ICD) -10 CRITERIA USING STANDARD SCALES. RESULTS: IN THE FINALIZED MODULE, 70.83% (34 OUT OF 48 ITEMS) OF THE PRACTICES WERE RETAINED ALONG WITH THE MODIFICATIONS AS SUGGESTED BY THE EXPERTS. TWO PRACTICES WERE NOT FOUND TO BE FEASIBLE (TRIKONASANA AND SHALABHASANA) AND HENCE WERE REMOVED FROM THE FINAL MODULE. A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PAIN SEVERITY WAS OBSERVED IN THE SUBJECTS AFTER PRACTISING THE YOGA MODULE FOR 2 WEEKS. THE CONTENT VALIDITY INDEX FOR THE WHOLE MODULE (AVERAGE OF ALL CVRS) WAS 0.55. CONCLUSIONS: AYOGA MODULE WAS DEVELOPED FOR SPD. THE CONTENT VALIDITY OF THE MODULE WAS FOUND TO BE GOOD. THE MODULE WAS FOUND SAFE AND POTENTIALLY USEFUL FOR REDUCING PAIN SEVERITY IN PATIENTS WITH SPD. FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD TEST THE EFFICACY OF THE DEVELOPED PROGRAM THROUGH A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
3  585  51 DESIGNING, VALIDATION, AND FEASIBILITY OF INTEGRATED YOGA THERAPY MODULE FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. CONTEXT: CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) IS A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM THAT HAS REACHED EPIDEMIC PROPORTIONS. YOGA THERAPY HAS EMERGED AS ONE OF THE COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES FOR CLBP. AIM: THE PRESENT STUDY REPORTS THE DEVELOPMENT, VALIDATION, AND FEASIBILITY OF AN INTEGRATED YOGA THERAPY MODULE (IYTM) FOR CLBP. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: THIS STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT AT THE SVYASA YOGA UNIVERSITY, BENGALURU, SOUTH INDIA. THE IYTM FOR CLBP WAS DESIGNED, VALIDATED, AND LATER TESTED FOR FEASIBILITY IN PATIENTS WITH CLBP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IN THE FIRST PHASE, IYTM FOR CLBP WAS DESIGNED BASED ON THE LITERATURE REVIEW OF CLASSICAL TEXTS AND RECENTLY PUBLISHED RESEARCH STUDIES. IN THE SECOND PHASE, DESIGNED IYTM (26 YOGA PRACTICES) WAS VALIDATED BY THIRTY SUBJECT MATTER (YOGA) EXPERTS. CONTENT VALIDITY RATIO (CVR) WAS ANALYZED USING LAWSHE'S FORMULA. IN THE THIRD PHASE, THE VALIDATED IYTM (20 YOGA PRACTICES) WAS TESTED ON 12 PATIENTS FOR PAIN, DISABILITY AND PERCEIVED STRESS AT BASELINE AND AFTER 1-MONTH OF THIS INTERVENTION. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 20 YOGA PRACTICES WITH CVR >/=0.33 WERE INCLUDED, 6 YOGA PRACTICES WITH CVR >/=0.33 WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE DESIGNED IYTM. THE FEASIBILITY STUDY WITH VALIDATED IYTM SHOWED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN NUMERICAL PAIN RATING SCALE (P = 0.02), OSWESTRY DISABILITY SCALE (P = 0.02), AND PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: THE DESIGNED IYTM WAS VALIDATED BY THIRTY YOGA EXPERTS AND LATER EVALUATED ON A SMALL SAMPLE. THIS STUDY HAS SHOWN THAT THE VALIDATED IYTM IS FEASIBLE, HAD NO ADVERSE EFFECTS AND WAS USEFUL IN ALLEVIATING PAIN, DISABILITY, AND PERCEIVED STRESS IN PATIENTS WITH CLBP. HOWEVER, RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS WITH LARGER SAMPLE ARE NEEDED TO STRENGTHEN THE STUDY.	2015

5 2461  29 YOGA AS A NOVEL ADJUVANT THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH IDIOPATHIC INFLAMMATORY MYOPATHIES. CONTEXT: RECENT STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS WELL TOLERATED BY PATIENTS WITH IDIOPATHIC INFLAMMATORY MYOPATHIES (IIMS) AND CAN HAVE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS AS AN ADJUVANT THERAPY TO PHARMACOLOGIC AGENTS, ESPECIALLY IF STARTED EARLY. TO DATE, NO STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PATIENTS WITH IIMS. AIMS: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SELF-REPORTED DIFFICULTY IN PERFORMING ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING (ADL) AND MUSCLE STRENGTH IN PATIENTS WITH MILD-TO-MODERATE IIMS. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A LONGITUDINAL COHORT STUDY IN WHICH PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSESSED USING THE MYOSITIS ACTIVITIES PROFILE (MAP) AND MANUAL MUSCLE TESTING (MMT) BEFORE AND AFTER THE COMPLETION OF AN 8-WEEK INSTRUCTOR-GUIDED YOGA COURSE WAS PERFORMED. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: WILCOXON SIGNED-RANKED TEST WAS PERFORMED FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. RESULTS: THE AVERAGE POSTTREATMENT MAP SCORES OF SIX PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED AN INCREASE OF 2.51 POINTS, WHILE THE AVERAGE MMT SCORE OF FOUR PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED AN INCREASE OF 11 POINTS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY IS THE FIRST STUDY TO DATE TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA AS AN ADJUVANT COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH IIM. CONTINUED RESEARCH SHOULD BE DONE ON THE EFFECT OF YOGA AS AN ADJUVANT THERAPY, FOR IN ADDITION TO INCREASE IN MUSCLE STRENGTH AND ABILITY TO PERFORM ADL, YOGA MAY OFFER POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS IN MOOD, MENTAL HEALTH, AND SLEEP.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
6 2556  19 YOGA FOR CHILDREN. THERE IS AN INCREASING INTEREST IN THE USE OF YOGA FOR CHILDREN TO CALM THE MIND AND INCREASE HEALTH AND WELL BEING. DESPITE SCANT BUT INCREASING EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN CHILDREN, SPECIAL YOGA PROGRAMS WITHIN SCHOOLS ARE BEING DEVELOPED FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS. THIS INCREASING POPULARITY OF THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA MAY ENCOURAGE PARENTS TO CONSIDER YOGA FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND REQUEST REFERRALS OR CLARIFICATION OF THE PURPORTED EFFECTS. A DESCRIPTION OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL BASIS OF YOGA, THE BASIC COMPONENTS OF A YOGA PRACTICE, SAFETY CONCERNS, AND HOW TO LOCATE AND EVALUATE A YOGA PROGRAM FOR CHILDREN WILL BE ADDRESSED.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
7  554  33 CORRELATION OF PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE WITH INTENT TO RECOMMEND ADJUNCTIVE OSTEOPATHIC MANIPULATIVE TREATMENT OR YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. CONTEXT: OSTEOPATHIC MANIPULATIVE TREATMENT (OMT) AND YOGA ARE BOTH RECOMMENDED BY SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS IN THE EVIDENCE-BASED RESEARCH LITERATURE FOR LOW BACK PAIN MANAGEMENT. IT IS UNKNOWN, TO THE AUTHORS' KNOWLEDGE, WHAT THE EFFECT OF PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH OMT OR YOGA, READING RESEARCH ARTICLES ON OMT OR YOGA, OR BOTH WILL HAVE ON MEDICAL STUDENTS' RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THESE TREATMENT OPTIONS TO FUTURE PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE LIKELIHOOD OF OSTEOPATHIC MEDICAL STUDENTS RECOMMENDING OMT OR YOGA TO TREAT PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN BASED ON THEIR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OR READING RESEARCH ARTICLES THAT RECOMMEND OMT OR YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. METHODS: IN THIS PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY, RESEARCHERS ADMINISTERED AN ANONYMOUS 18-QUESTION ONLINE SURVEY FOR OSTEOPATHIC MEDICAL STUDENTS. THE SURVEY INCLUDED A PATIENT VIGNETTE, 2 EVIDENCE-BASED ARTICLES, AND MULTIPLE CHOICE, YES/NO, AND LIKERT-TYPE QUESTIONS. PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED VIA EMAIL FROM ALL 4 YEARS OF MEDICAL SCHOOL. BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCES IN PROPORTIONS WERE ASSESSED WITH DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS AND CHI2 TESTS; DIFFERENCES WITHIN GROUPS WERE ASSESSED WITH THE MCNEMAR TEST; AND FISCHER EXACT TESTS WERE USED WHEN EXPECTED CELL COUNTS WERE LESS THAN 5. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 180 PARTICIPANTS (100 MALE, 80 FEMALE) COMPLETED THE STUDY. PERSONAL EXPERIENCE INCREASED THE LIKELIHOOD OF OSTEOPATHIC MEDICAL STUDENTS RECOMMENDING OMT (P<.018) OR YOGA (P<.001) TO A FUTURE PATIENT OR TO A PATIENT IN A CASE VIGNETTE (P<.05) WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. STUDENTS WHO READ RESEARCH ARTICLES WERE MORE LIKELY TO RECOMMEND OMT TO THE CASE PATIENT AND FUTURE PATIENTS BEFORE AND AFTER READING THE INTERVENTION ARTICLE REGARDLESS OF THEIR EXPERIENCE (P<.001). CONCLUSION: PERSONAL EXPERIENCE AND READING EVIDENCE-BASED RESEARCH MAY INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT OSTEOPATHIC MEDICAL STUDENTS WILL RECOMMEND OMT TO FUTURE PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN.	2018	
          
8 2890  25 YOGA: POTENTIAL BENEFITS FOR PERSONS WHO STUTTER. YOGA HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO MODULATE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM ACTIVITY, DECREASING ANXIETY AND STRESS, AND IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE. THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY SOUGHT TO EXAMINE THE USE OF YOGIC TECHNIQUES ON PERSONS WHO STUTTER GIVEN THE INTERACTION BETWEEN PHYSIOLOGICAL AROUSAL/ANXIETY AND STUTTERING THAT CURRENT MULTIFACTORIAL MODELS OF STUTTERING PROPOSE. FOUR PARTICIPANTS (M = 52 YR, SD = 10; 2 FEMALE, 2 MALE), RECRUITED FROM LOCAL STUTTERING SUPPORT GROUPS IN THE GREATER PHILADELPHIA COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERED TO PARTICIPATE. STUTTERING SEVERITY, ANXIETY, AND EXPERIENCES REGARDING STUTTERING AND COMMUNICATION WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE, POST INTERVENTION, AND AT 4 MONTHS FOLLOW-UP. THE PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED GROUP YOGA SESSIONS AND ENGAGED IN HOME PRACTICE. DESCRIPTIVE RESULTS REVEALED THAT PARTICIPANTS SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS ACROSS OUTCOME MEASURES, WITH THE MOST IMPROVEMENT RELATED TO ANXIETY. PARTICIPANTS ALSO REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN THEIR PERCEPTIONS ABOUT COMMUNICATION AS PER QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF RESPONSES TO THE OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONNAIRES. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR PERSONS WHO STUTTER AND WARRANTS FURTHER STUDY USING AN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
9  485  19 CLINICAL GROUP SUPERVISION IN YOGA THERAPY: MODEL EFFECTS, AND LESSONS LEARNED. CLINICAL SUPERVISION IS AN INTEGRAL COMPONENT OF THERAPIST TRAINING AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE OF ITS CAPACITY FOR FOSTERING KNOWLEDGE, SELF-AWARENESS, AND CLINICAL ACUMEN. INDIVIDUAL SUPERVISION IS PART OF MANY YOGA THERAPY TRAINING PROGRAMS AND IS REFERENCED IN THE IAYT STANDARDS AS "MENTORING." GROUP SUPERVISION IS NOT TYPICALLY USED IN THE TRAINING OF YOGA THERAPISTS. WE PROPOSE THAT GROUP SUPERVISION EFFECTIVELY SUPPORTS THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF YOGA THERAPISTS-IN-TRAINING. WE PRESENT A MODEL OF GROUP SUPERVISION FOR YOGA THERAPIST TRAINEES DEVELOPED BY THE NEW ENGLAND SCHOOL OF INTEGRATIVE YOGA THERAPEUTICS (THE NESIYT MODEL) THAT INCLUDES THE BACKGROUND, STRUCTURE, FORMAT, AND DEVELOPMENT OF OUR INAUGURAL 18-MONTH SUPERVISION GROUP. PRE-AND POST-SUPERVISION SURVEYS AND ANALYZED CASE NOTES, WHICH CAPTURED KEY DIDACTIC AND PROCESS THEMES, ARE DISCUSSED. CLINICAL ISSUES, SUCH AS BOUNDARIES, PERFORMANCE ANXIETY, SENSE OF SELF EFFICACY, THE THERAPEUTIC ALLIANCE, TRANSFERENCE AND COUNTER TRANSFERENCE, PACING OF YOGA THERAPY SESSIONS, EVALUATION OF CLIENT PROGRESS, AND ADJUNCT THERAPIST INTERACTION ARE REVIEWED. THE TIMING AND SEQUENCE OF DIDACTIC AND PROCESS THEMES AND BENEFITS FOR YOGA THERAPIST TRAINEES' PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT, ARE DISCUSSED. THE NESIYT GROUP SUPERVISION MODEL IS OFFERED AS AN EFFECTIVE BLUEPRINT FOR YOGA THERAPY TRAINING PROGRAMS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
10  579  26 DESIGNING A YOGA INTERVENTION PROGRAM TO IMPROVE WELL-BEING FOR PHYSICIAN TRAINEES: CHALLENGES AND LESSONS LEARNED. WELL-BEING ACTIVITIES MAY HELP TO COUNTERACT PHYSICIAN BURNOUT. YOGA IS KNOWN TO ENHANCE WELL-BEING, BUT THERE ARE FEW STUDIES OF YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR PHYSICIANS IN TRAINING. THIS PROSPECTIVE METHODOLOGY-DEVELOPMENT STUDY AIMED TO EXPLORE HOW TO ESTABLISH A YOGA-BASED WELL-BEING INTERVENTION FOR PHYSICIAN TRAINEES IN A LARGE URBAN TRAINING HOSPITAL. WE AIMED TO IDENTIFY FACTORS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO TRAINEE PARTICIPATION AND EXPLORE AN INSTRUMENT TO MEASURE CHANGES IN SELF-REPORTED WELL-BEING AFTER YOGA. COHORTS INCLUDED A REQUIRED-ATTENDANCE GROUP, A VOLUNTARY-ATTENDANCE GROUP, AND AN UNASSIGNED WALK-IN YOGA GROUP. WEEKLY 1-HOUR YOGA SESSIONS WERE LED BY A QUALIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTOR FOR 4 WEEKS. THE SEVEN-QUESTION RESIDENT PHYSICIAN WELL-BEING INDEX (RPWBI) WAS USED TO MEASURE RESIDENT WELL-BEING BEFORE YOGA, AFTER 4 WEEKS OF YOGA, AND 6 MONTHS POST-YOGA. TRAINEES ATTENDING EACH SESSION RANGED FROM 17 FOR REQUIRED YOGA TO 0-2 FOR VOLUNTARY YOGA, 2-9 FOR LUNCHTIME WALK-IN YOGA, AND 1-7 FOR EVENING WALK-IN YOGA. IN THE REQUIRED-YOGA GROUP (N = 17), OVERALL RPWBI MEAN SCORES DID NOT CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY ACROSS THE THREE QUERY TIMES, AND PARTICIPATION IN THE SURVEY DECLINED OVER TIME. THE MEAN BASELINE RPWBI SCORE FOR THE REQUIRED GROUP BEFORE YOGA WAS IN THE NON-DISTRESSED RANGE AND ANSWERS TO THE SEVEN INDIVIDUAL QUESTIONS VARIED. REQUIRING A YOGA ACTIVITY FOR MEDICAL TRAINEES MAY BE A GOOD STRATEGY FOR PROMOTING PARTICIPATION IN YOGA. THE RPWBI MAY HAVE LIMITED UTILITY FOR MEASURING CHANGES IN OVERALL GROUP WELL-BEING AFTER A YOGA INTERVENTION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
11  621  47 DEVELOPMENT, VALIDATION, AND FEASIBILITY OF A SCHOOL-BASED SHORT DURATION INTEGRATED CLASSROOM YOGA MODULE: A PILOT STUDY DESIGN. BACKGROUND: THE PRACTICE OF YOGA IS PROVEN TO HAVE PHYSICAL, COGNITIVE AND EMOTIONAL BENEFITS FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN. DESPITE THIS MANY SCHOOLS DO NOT INCLUDE YOGA IN THEIR DAILY SCHEDULE. THE REASONS CITED ARE LACK OF TIME AND RESOURCES. TO OVERCOME THESE PROBLEMS THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE A SHORT DURATION INTEGRATED CLASSROOM YOGA MODULE. THE DESIGN GUIDELINES WERE THAT IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO PRACTICE IN THE CLASSROOM ENVIRONMENT AND THAT IT COULD BE LED BY THE CLASS TEACHER. IN THIS WAY THE MODULE WOULD OVERCOME THE PROBLEM OF BOTH TIME AND RESOURCE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE STUDY HAD TWO MAIN PHASES. IN THE FIRST PHASE, SELECTED ICYM PRACTICES BASED ON THE LITERATURE REVIEW WERE VALIDATED BY 21 SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS USING LAWHSE'S CONTENT VALIDITY RATIO (CVR) FORMULA. IN THE SECOND PHASE, A PILOT STUDY USING A PAIRED SAMPLE PREPOST MEASUREMENT DESIGN WAS CARRIED OUT ON 49 HIGH SCHOOL CHILDREN. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN JUNE 2019. THE INTERVENTION PERIOD WAS 1 MONTH, AND THE TEST VARIABLES WERE PHYSICAL FITNESS, COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE, SELF-ESTEEM, EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING, AND PERSONALITY CHARACTERISTIC. PAIRED SAMPLE T-TEST WAS THE ANALYSIS TOOL AND THE SOFTWARE USED WAS THE STATISTICAL PACKAGE FOR THE SOCIAL SCIENCE VERSION 26. RESULTS: IN THE LAWSHE'S CVR ANALYSIS, 17 OUT OF THE 24 PRACTICES TESTED WERE RATED BY EXPERTS AS ESSENTIAL AS WAS THE OVERALL MODULE (CVR SCORE >/=0.429). IN THE PILOT STUDY, THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE POSTMEAN SCORES COMPARED TO PREMEAN SCORES, FOR ALL THE 4 EUROFIT PHYSICAL FITNESS TESTING BATTERY TESTS (P < 0.02), ALL THE THREE SCORES OF THE STROOP COLOR-WORD NAMING TASK (P < 0.001) AND THE ROSENBERG SELF-ESTEEM SCALE (P < 0.008). CONCLUSION: ICYM WAS VALIDATED AND FOUND FEASIBLE BY THE PRESENT STUDY. IT WAS FOUND TO HAVE A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PHYSICAL FITNESS, COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE, AND SELF-ESTEEM VARIABLES. HOWEVER, A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL WITH A LONGER INTERVENTION PERIOD IS NEEDED TO STRENGTHEN THE PRESENT STUDY.	2021	

12 1213  33 EXPLORING PERCEIVED BENEFITS, MOTIVES, BARRIERS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRESCRIBING YOGA EXERCISES AS A NONPHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION FOR PATIENTS WITH EPILEPSY: A QUALITATIVE STUDY FROM PALESTINE. OBJECTIVES: YOGA IS BELIEVED TO PLAY A ROLE IN STABILIZING THE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM AND THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM, THUS MIGHT HELP CONTROL SEIZURES IN PEOPLE WITH EPILEPSY (PWE). THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO EXPLORE EXPERIENCES OF PALESTINIAN PWE WITH REGARD TO BENEFITS, MOTIVES, BARRIERS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF PRESCRIBING YOGA EXERCISES AS A NONPHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION. METHODS: PURPOSIVE AND SNOWBALL SAMPLING TECHNIQUES WERE USED TO RECRUIT PWE WHO PRACTICED YOGA. SEMI-STRUCTURED IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS (N=18) WERE CONDUCTED WITH THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS. THE INTERPRETIVE DESCRIPTION METHOD WAS USED TO QUALITATIVELY ANALYZE THE DATA COLLECTED DURING THE INTERVIEWS. RESULTS: FOLLOWING THE THEMATIC ANALYSIS ADOPTED FOR THIS STUDY, FOUR MAJOR THEMES EMERGED. THESE THEMES WERE AS FOLLOWS: PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF YOGA, MOTIVES TO PRACTICE YOGA, BARRIERS TO PRACTICE YOGA, AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON EFFECTIVE YOGA PRACTICE FOR PWE. THE PERCEIVED BENEFITS INCLUDED IMPROVEMENTS IN MANAGEMENT OF SEIZURES, PSYCHOLOGICAL, PHYSICAL, AND SOCIAL WELL-BEING. PEOPLE WITH EPILEPSY WERE MOTIVATED BY THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF YOGA. BARRIERS OF ADHERENCE TO PRACTICE INCLUDED PERSONAL AND LOGISTIC FACTORS. THE INTERVIEWEES RECOMMENDED TAILORING YOGA SESSIONS TO THE NEEDS OF PWE. CONCLUSION: THIS EXPLORATIVE QUALITATIVE STUDY REPORTED PERCEIVED BENEFITS, MOTIVES, BARRIERS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF YOGA AS A NONPHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION FOR PWE. PEOPLE WITH EPILEPSY USED YOGA AS A BENEFICIAL NONPHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH AND REDUCE THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF EPILEPSY ON THEIR PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL-BEING. FUTURE STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO INVESTIGATE THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF YOGA WHEN SESSIONS ARE TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF PWE.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                             
13  595  31 DEVELOPMENT AND FEASIBILITY OF NEED-BASED YOGA PROGRAM FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS OF IN-PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA IN INDIA. CONTEXT AND AIM: YOGA HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF STRESS. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A YOGA PROGRAM AIMED TO REDUCE BURDEN AND IMPROVE COPING OF FAMILY CAREGIVERS OF INPATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA IN INDIA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BASED ON THE ASSESSMENT OF CAREGIVER NEEDS, LITERATURE REVIEW, AND EXPERT OPINION, A TEN-DAY GROUP YOGA PROGRAM WAS INITIALLY DEVELOPED USING THE QUALITATIVE INDUCTIVE METHOD OF INQUIRY. EACH DAY'S PROGRAM INCLUDED WARM-UP EXERCISES, YOGIC ASANAS, PRANAYAMA, AND SATSANG. A STRUCTURED QUESTIONNAIRE ELICITING COMMENTS ON EACH DAY'S CONTENTS WAS GIVEN INDEPENDENTLY TO TEN EXPERIENCED YOGA PROFESSIONALS WORKING IN THE FIELD OF HEALTH FOR VALIDATION. THE FINAL VERSION OF THE PROGRAM WAS PILOT-TESTED ON A GROUP OF SIX CAREGIVERS OF IN-PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA ADMITTED AT NIMHANS, BANGALORE. RESULTS: ON THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE PROGRAM WOULD HELP REDUCE THE BURDEN OF CAREGIVERS, SIX OF THE TEN EXPERTS (60%) GAVE A RANK OF FOUR OF FIVE (VERY MUCH USEFUL). BASED ON COMMENTS OF THE EXPERTS, SEVERAL CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE PROGRAM. IN THE PILOT-TESTING STAGE, MORE THAN 60% OF THE CAREGIVERS ASSIGNED A SCORE OF FOUR AND ABOVE (ON A FIVE-POINT LIKERT SCALE, FIVE BEING EXTREMELY USEFUL) FOR THE OVERALL PROGRAM, HANDOUTS DISTRIBUTED, AND PERFORMANCE OF THE TRAINER. QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK OF THE CAREGIVERS FURTHER ENDORSED THE FEASIBILITY AND USEFULNESS OF THE PROGRAM. CONCLUSION: THE DEVELOPED YOGA PROGRAM WAS FOUND TO BE ACCEPTABLE TO CAREGIVERS OF IN-PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
14 2611  24 YOGA FOR REHABILITATION: AN OVERVIEW. THE USE OF YOGA FOR REHABILITATION HAS DIVERSE APPLICATIONS. YOGA PRACTICE BENEFITED MENTALLY HANDICAPPED SUBJECTS BY IMPROVING THEIR MENTAL ABILITY, ALSO THE MOTOR CO-ORDINATION AND SOCIAL SKILLS. PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED SUBJECTS HAD A RESTORATION OF SOME DEGREE OF FUNCTIONAL ABILITY AFTER PRACTICING YOGA. VISUALLY IMPAIRED CHILDREN CHILDREN SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THEIR ABNORMAL ANXIETY LEVELS WHEN THEY PRACTICED YOGA FOR THREE WEEKS, WHILE A PROGRAM OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY HAD NO SUCH EFFECT. SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED ADULTS (PRISONERS IN A JAIL) AND CHILDREN IN A REMAND HOME SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SLEEP, APPETITE AND GENERAL WELL BEING, AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN PHYSIOLOGICAL AROUSAL. THE PRACTICE OF MEDITATION WAS REPORTED TO DECREASE THE DEGREE OF SUBSTANCE (MARIJUANA) ABUSE, BY STRENGTHENING THE MENTAL RESOLVE AND DECREASING THE ANXIETY. ANOTHER IMPORTANT AREA IS THE APPLICATION OF YOGA (AND INDEED, LIFESTYLE CHANGE), IN THE REHABILITATION OF PATIENTS WITH CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE. FINALLY, THE POSSIBLE ROLE OF YOGA IN IMPROVING THE MENTAL STATE AND GENERAL WELL BEING OF HIV POSITIVE PERSONS AND PATIENTS WITH AIDS, IS BEING EXPLORED.	1997	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
15 1833  18 PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLNESS, YOGA AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS AFFECTED BY SCHIZOPHRENIA SPECTRUM DISORDERS: A PILOT STUDY. SCHIZOPHRENIA IS A SERIOUS PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER CHARACTERIZED BY POSITIVE SYMPTOMS, NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS AND NEUROCOGNITIVE DEFICITS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ESTIMATE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN WELLNESS, YOGA AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS AFFECTED BY SCHIZOPHRENIA SPECTRUM DISORDERS. PARTICIPANTS WERE 30 PATIENTS WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA IN CARE AT THE REHABILITATIVE PSYCHIATRY AND RESEARCH VILLA CHIARA CLINIC IN MASCALUCIA (CATANIA, ITALY), AFTER THAT RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO TWO GROUPS. THE FIRST GROUP FOLLOWED THE EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT WITH SETS OF YOGA EXERCISES CONDUCTED BY A YOGA TRAINER AND A PSYCHIATRIST OR A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST EXPERT IN YOGA, WHILE A SECOND CONTROL GROUP WAS TREATED WITH USUAL CARE. THE RESULTS REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE, BEFORE AND AFTER TREATMENT, BETWEEN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND THE CONTROL GROUP IN QUALITY OF LIFE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
16 2384  30 YOGA - A LABORIOUS WAY TO WELL-BEING: PATIENTS' EXPERIENCES OF YOGA AS A TREATMENT FOR HYPERTENSION IN PRIMARY CARE. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO DESCRIBE PATIENTS' EXPERIENCE OF YOGA AS A TREATMENT FOR HYPERTENSION, AS WELL AS THEIR EXPERIENCE OF LIVING WITH HYPERTENSION. DESIGN: QUALITATIVE INTERVIEW STUDY METHOD AND MATERIALS: IN 2013-2014, IN SOUTHERN SWEDEN, PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION FROM THREE HEALTH CARE CENTRES WERE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL ON YOGA FOR HYPERTENSION. AFTER COMPLETION OF THE STUDY, EIGHT WOMEN AND FIVE MEN (AGED 35-79), WHO HAD PRACTICED THE YOGA INTERVENTION, WERE INTERVIEWED ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCES. WE USED A SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW GUIDE ACCORDING TO KVALE. QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED BY SYSTEMATIC TEXT CONDENSATION INSPIRED BY MALTERUD. RESULTS: TWO MAIN THEMES EMERGED DURING THE ANALYSIS PROCESS: YOGA - A LABORIOUS WAY TO WELL-BEING AND HYPERTENSION - A SILENT DISEASE. THE POSITIVE EXPERIENCES OF DOING YOGA WERE DESCRIBED IN TERMS OF TRANQUILLITY AND INCREASED AGILITY. THE DRAWBACKS WERE MAINLY LINKED TO THE TIME REQUIRED TO PERFORM THE EXERCISES. LIVING WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE AND HAVING TO TAKE MEDICATION CAN IMPLY A STIGMA AND CAUSE CONCERNS FOR FUTURE CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS. MOST PATIENTS THAT WE INTERVIEWED EXPRESSED A WISH TO FIND ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO TREAT THEIR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. PARTICIPATING IN THE YOGA STUDY WAS SEEN AS A GOOD POSSIBILITY TO TRY SUCH AN ALTERNATIVE WAY. CONCLUSIONS: MANY PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION IN SWEDISH PRIMARY CARE SEEM TO BE INTERESTED IN TRYING ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS TO CONTROL BLOOD PRESSURE. THE PATIENTS IN OUR STUDY EXPERIENCED SEVERAL BENEFITS FROM DOING YOGA, BUT THEY ALSO POINTED OUT DIFFICULTIES IN IMPLEMENTING YOGA AS A REGULAR AND PERMANENT LIFESTYLE CHANGE.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
17 2645  30 YOGA FOR YOUNG ADULTS WITH NONCURATIVE CANCER: A BRIEF REPORT. BACKGROUND: THE PRACTICE OF YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE DISEASE- AND TREATMENT-RELATED SIDE EFFECTS IN THE NONCURATIVE CANCER PATIENT. OBJECTIVE: THIS USER EXPERIENCE STUDY AIMED TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND USEFULNESS OF A DVD-BASED YOGA PROGRAM FOR YOUNG ADULT CANCER PATIENTS WITH A NONCURATIVE DIAGNOSIS. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO PARTAKE IN A 7-WEEK DVD-BASED YOGA PROGRAM AND COMPLETE MEASURES OF PROGRAM USE AND USEFULNESS. RESULTS: NINE PATIENTS EXPRESSED STUDY INTEREST AND 5 CONSENTED TO PARTICIPATE. FOUR COMPLETED THE FULL STUDY PROTOCOL. PARTICIPANTS REPORTED BEING SATISFIED WITH THE PROGRAM AND DESCRIBED THAT IT PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SELF-CARE. IMPROVEMENTS IN FUNCTIONAL, PHYSICAL, AND SPIRITUAL WELL-BEING AND OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE WERE FOUND. BARRIERS INCLUDED COMPETING TIME DEMANDS AND FEELING UNWELL. NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSION: THE PROGRAM WAS VIEWED AS AN ACCESSIBLE AND USEFUL ACTIVITY OPTION; HOWEVER, A DESIRE FOR GREATER SOCIAL SUPPORT FROM RELATABLE OTHERS WAS HIGHLIGHTED.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
18 1312  18 HEALTH STATUS OF NURSES AND YOGA. I. BASELINE DATA. IN THIS ONGOING ICMR PROJECT ON "EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE HEALTH OF NURSES", SOME BASELINE DATA ON THE HEALTH OF NURSES OF NEHRU HOSPITAL, P.G.I., CHANDIGARH ARE REPORTED. THIS WAS OBTAINED BEFORE THE START OF YOGA THERAPY IN SELECTED CASES AND COLLECTED WITH THE HELP OF SIX PSYCHOLOGICAL TOOLS. OUT OF A TOTAL OF 501 NURSES, 452 (90.2%) COULD BE CONTACTED AND STUDIED. MEAN AGE WAS 30.43 YEARS AND MEAN YEARS OF SERVICE 9.93 YEARS. MEAN SCORES ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTS INDICATED POOR HEALTH STATUS OF NURSES, AVERAGE NEUROTICISM, DEPRESSIVE TENDENCIES AND ROLE STRESS. SENSE OF WELL-BEING WAS HIGH IN THEM. THE DATA IS DISCUSSED IN THE LIGHT OF RESEARCHES IN THIS AREA. THIS IS THE FIRST OF A SERIES OF THREE ARTICLES TO BE PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL.	1989	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
19  371  25 AWARENESS AND PRACTICE OF AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA AMONG HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS IN ANAND CITY. BACKGROUND: AEROBIC EXERCISE IS HELPFUL IN REDUCING ELEVATED BLOOD PRESSURE (BP). IT WAS ALSO FOUND THAT YOGA IS USEFUL IN REDUCING RAISED BP. THUS, THEY BOTH CAN BE USED IN PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION. HENCE, THE STUDY AIMED TO OBSERVE BOTH AWARENESS AND PRACTICE OF AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA AMONG HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS IN ANAND CITY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL DESCRIPTIVE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED. A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS PREPARED CONTAINING 24 QUESTIONS ABOUT AWARENESS AND PRACTICE OF AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA AMONG HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS. THE QUESTIONS WERE EXPLAINED TO ALL THE PATIENTS, AND 200 PATIENTS WERE RECRUITED FROM ANAND CITY THROUGH CONVENIENCE SAMPLING. RESULTS: TWO-HUNDRED PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED IN THIS STUDY, OF WHICH 100% WERE AWARE OF HYPERTENSION. 67.68% WERE AWARE OF THE ROLE OF AEROBIC EXERCISE IN HYPERTENSION, OF WHICH 58.29% PRACTICED THEM. THE AWARENESS OF THE ROLE OF YOGA IN HYPERTENSION WAS NOTED IN 33.67% OF PATIENTS, OF WHICH ONLY 13.07% PRACTICED PRANAYAMA AND 9.50% PRACTICED ASANAS. CONCLUSION: THERE WAS A COMPLETE AWARENESS OF HYPERTENSION AMONG HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS. A LARGE NUMBER OF PATIENTS WERE AWARE OF THE ROLE OF AEROBIC EXERCISE IN HYPERTENSION, BUT ONLY FEW OF THE PATIENTS PRACTICED THEM. HOWEVER, THERE WAS LESS AWARENESS OF THE ROLE OF YOGA IN HYPERTENSION AND EVEN LESSER NUMBER PRACTICED THEM.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
20 1169  22 EVALUATION OF A SOCIAL COGNITIVE THEORY-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION TO REDUCE ANXIETY. YOGA IS OFTEN VIEWED AS A FORM OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE, AS IT STRIVES TO ACHIEVE EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN THE BODY AND MIND THAT AIDS HEALING. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THE BENEFICIAL ROLE OF YOGA IN ANXIETY REDUCTION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DESIGN AND EVALUATE A 10-WEEK SOCIAL COGNITIVE THEORY BASED YOGA INTERVENTION TO REDUCE ANXIETY. THE YOGA INTERVENTION UTILIZED THE CONSTRUCTS OF BEHAVIORAL CAPABILITY, EXPECTATIONS, SELF-EFFICACY FOR YOGA FROM SOCIAL COGNITIVE THEORY, AND INCLUDED ASANAS (POSTURES), PRANAYAMA (BREATHING TECHNIQUES), SHAVA ASANA (RELAXATION), AND DHYANA (MEDITATION). A ONE-BETWEEN AND ONE-WITHIN GROUP, QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN WAS UTILIZED FOR EVALUATION. SCALES MEASURING EXPECTATIONS FROM YOGA, SELF-EFFICACY FOR YOGA, AND SPEILBERGER'S STATE TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY, WERE ADMINISTERED BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION. REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSES OF VARIANCE (ANOVA) WERE PERFORMED TO COMPARE PRE-TEST AND POST-TEST SCORES IN THE TWO GROUPS. YOGA AS AN APPROACH SHOWS PROMISING RESULTS FOR ANXIETY REDUCTION.	2011

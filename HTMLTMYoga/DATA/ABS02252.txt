1 2252 139 THE METABOLIC COST OF HATHA YOGA. TO DETERMINE THE METABOLIC AND HEART RATE (HR) RESPONSES OF HATHA YOGA, 26 WOMEN (19-40 YEARS OLD) PERFORMED A 30-MINUTE HATHA YOGA ROUTINE OF SUPINE LYING, SITTING, AND STANDING ASANAS (I.E., POSTURES). SUBJECTS FOLLOWED IDENTICAL VIDEOTAPED SEQUENCES OF HATHA YOGA ASANAS. MEAN PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES WERE COMPARED TO THE PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES OF RESTING IN A CHAIR AND WALKING ON A TREADMILL AT 93.86 M.MIN(-1) [3.5 MILES PER HOUR (MPH)]. DURING THE 30-MINUTE HATHA YOGA ROUTINE, MEAN ABSOLUTE OXYGEN CONSUMPTION (VO(2)), RELATIVE VO(2), PERCENTAGE MAXIMAL OXYGEN CONSUMPTION (%VO(2)R), METABOLIC EQUIVALENTS (METS), ENERGY EXPENDITURE, HR, AND PERCENTAGE MAXIMAL HEART RATE (%MHR) WERE 0.45 L.MIN(-1), 7.59 ML.KG(-1).MIN(-1), 14.50%, 2.17 METS, 2.23 KCAL.MIN(-1), 105.29 B.MIN(-1), AND 56.89%, RESPECTIVELY. WHEN COMPARED TO RESTING IN A CHAIR, HATHA YOGA REQUIRED 114% GREATER O(2) (L.MIN(-1)), 111% GREATER O(2)(ML.KG(-1).MIN(-1)), 4,294% GREATER %VO(2)R, 111% GREATER METS, 108% GREATER KCAL.MIN(-1), 24% GREATER HR, AND 24% GREATER %MHR. WHEN COMPARED TO WALKING AT 93.86 M.MIN(-1), HATHA YOGA REQUIRED 54% LOWER O(2)(L.MIN(-1)), 53% LOWER O(2)(ML.KG(-1).MIN(-1)), 68% LOWER %VO(2)R, 53% LOWER METS, 53% LOWER KCAL.MIN(-1), 21% LOWER HR, AND 21% LOWER %MHR. THE HATHA YOGA ROUTINE IN THIS STUDY REQUIRED 14.50% VO(2)R, WHICH CAN BE CONSIDERED A VERY LIGHT INTENSITY AND SIGNIFICANTLY LIGHTER THAN 44.8% VO(2)R FOR WALKING AT 93.86 M.MIN(-1) (3.5 MPH). THE INTENSITY OF HATHA YOGA MAY BE TOO LOW TO PROVIDE A TRAINING STIMULUS FOR IMPROVING CARDIOVASCULAR FITNESS. ALTHOUGH PREVIOUS RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT HATHA YOGA IS AN ACCEPTABLE FORM OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOR ENHANCING MUSCULAR FITNESS AND FLEXIBILITY, THESE DATA DEMONSTRATE THAT HATHA YOGA MAY HAVE LITTLE, IF ANY, CARDIOVASCULAR BENEFIT.	2005	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
2 1693  31 OXYGEN CONSUMPTION DURING VINIYOGA PRACTICE IN ADULTS. CONTEXT: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO MEASURE THE OXYGEN CONSUMPTION (VO2) DURING VINIYOGA YOGA MOVEMENTS (ASANAS) AND TO COMPARE VO2 WALKING AMONG ADULTS. METHODS: YOGA PRACTITIONERS (N = 10) WERE RECRUITED TO MEASURE VO2 WHILE AT REST (30 MIN), PRACTICING YOGA (16 MOVEMENTS WITH DIFFERENT VARIATIONS), AND TREADMILL WALKING AT 2 MPH (10 MIN) AND 3 MPH (10 MIN). VO2 WAS MEASURED USING A WHOLE-ROOM INDIRECT CALORIMETRY. EACH YOGA MOVEMENT WAS CATEGORIZED BY BODY ORIENTATION AS STANDING, LYING, AND SITTING. THE DIFFERENCES IN VO2 BETWEEN YOGA AND WALKING WERE EXAMINED USING PEARSON'S CORRELATIONS. DIFFERENCES IN VO2 BETWEEN POSES (STANDING, SITTING, AND LYING) WERE EXAMINED USING LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS. VO2. RESULTS: MEAN YOGA-VO2 FOR THE ENTIRE YOGA SESSION WAS 3.7 (STANDARD DEVIATION [SD] 0.43, RANGE: 4.4-8.9) ML/KG/MIN. YOGA-VO2 VARIED BY BODY ORIENTATION: STANDING = 7.5 (SD = 1.5) ML/KG/MIN, LYING = 5.3 (SD = 1.0) ML/KG/MIN, AND SITTING = 5.4 (SD = 1.1) ML/KG/MIN. AFTER ADJUSTING FOR BODY MASS, FREQUENCY OF YOGA PRACTICE, AND RESTING ENERGY EXPENDITURE, FEMALE GENDER WAS NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH MEAN YOGA VO2 FOR STANDING (B = -112.19, P < 0.05), LYING (B = -141.87, P < 0.05), AND SITTING (B = -129.96, P < 0.05). MEAN VO2 FOR WALKING 2 MPH WAS COMPARABLE WITH SITTING (R = 0.836, P < 0.05) AND LYING (R = 0.735, P < 0.05) WHEREAS WALKING AT 3 MPH WAS COMPARABLE WITH STANDING (R = 0.718, P < 0.05) AND SITTING (R = 0.760, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: WE CONCLUDE THAT VO2 DURING YOGA PRACTICE IS COMPARABLE TO VO2 DURING SLOW TREADMILL WALKING AND MAY VARY BASED ON GENDER AND BODY ORIENTATION.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
3  268  33 ACUTE PHYSIOLOGIC EFFECTS OF PERFORMING YOGA IN THE HEAT ON ENERGY EXPENDITURE, RANGE OF MOTION, AND INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS. PERFORMING YOGA IN A HEATED ENVIRONMENT (HY) IS A POPULAR EXERCISE MODE PURPORTED TO IMPROVE RANGE OF MOTION (ROM), BODY COMPOSITION, AND AEROBIC FITNESS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS INVESTIGATION WAS TO COMPARE A SESSION OF HY TO ROOM TEMPERATURE YOGA (RTY) WITH REGARDS TO ROM, OXYGEN CONSUMPTION, CALORIC EXPENDITURE, AND BIOMARKERS OF ACUTE STRESS AND INFLAMMATION. SIXTEEN EXPERIENCED YOGA PRACTITIONERS (F14, M2; 40 +/- 11YR; 22.6 +/- 1.8 KG/M(2)) COMPLETED A 1-HOUR STANDARDIZED BIKRAM SEQUENCE IN HY (105 DEGREES F, 40 DEGREES C) AND RTY (74 DEGREES F, 23.3 DEGREES C) CONDITIONS (ORDER OF CONDITIONS RANDOMIZED, HUMIDITY STANDARDIZED AT 40%). INTRA-EXERCISE METABOLIC GAS EXCHANGE AND HEART RATE (HR) WAS MONITORED USING A METABOLIC CART. ROM MEASURES WERE TAKEN PRE AND POST-EXERCISE AT THE ELBOW, SHOULDER, HIP, AND KNEE. CYTOKINES INTERLEUKIN 6,10 (IL-6, IL-10) AND TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR ALPHA (TNF-ALPHA) WERE ANALYZED FROM BLOOD SAMPLES COLLECTED PRE- AND 30-MINUTES POST-EXERCISE. INTRA-EXERCISE METABOLIC GAS EXCHANGE AND HEART RATE (HR) WAS MONITORED USING A METABOLIC CART. BOTH BOUTS ELICITED SIMILAR ACUTE CHANGES IN ROM ALTHOUGH HY ELICITED A GREATER INCREASE IN HIP ABDUCTION (RTYDELTA DEGREES = 2.3 +/- 1.3|HYDELTA DEGREES = 6.6 +/- 1.5; P < 0.05). MEAN VO2, PEAK VO2, %VO2MAX, HR, AND KCAL EXPENDITURE DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN CONDITIONS. RER WAS LOWER DURING THE HY (RTY = 0.95 +/- 0.02| HY = 0.89 +/- 0.02; P < 0.05) WITH A CONCOMITANT ELEVATION IN FAT OXIDATION (RTY = 0.05 +/- 0.01|HY = 0.09 +/- 0.01, G.MIN(-1); P < 0.05) AND DECREASE IN CARBOHYDRATE OXIDATION (RTY = 0.51 +/- 0.04|HY = 0.44 +/- 0.03, G.MIN(-1); P < 0.05). SERUM IL-6 WAS INCREASED (15.5 +/- 8.0-FOLD) FOLLOWING HY ONLY (P < 0.05). HY DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY ELEVATE AEROBIC ENERGY COST COMPARED TO RTY BUT MAY ACUTELY INCREASE FAT SUBSTRATE UTILIZATION AND HIP ROM. FUTURE STUDIES REMAIN NEEDED TO ESTABLISH DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIPS FOR INCLUDING HY OR RTY INTO WELL-ROUNDED FITNESS PROGRAMS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
4  437  32 CARDIOVASCULAR AND METABOLIC EFFECTS OF INTENSIVE HATHA YOGA TRAINING IN MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER WOMEN FROM NORTHERN MEXICO. BACKGROUND: HATHA YOGA (HY) CAN BE AN ALTERNATIVE TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER WOMEN. HOWEVER, CONVENTIONAL HY (CHY) EXERCISING MAY NOT RESULT IN ENOUGH TRAINING STIMULUS TO IMPROVE CARDIOVASCULAR FITNESS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF AN INTENSIVE HY INTERVENTION (IHY) ON CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS IN MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER WOMEN FROM NORTHERN MEXICO. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IN THIS PROSPECTIVE QUASIEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN, FOUR MIDDLE-AGED AND NINE OLDER CHY PRACTICING FEMALES (YOGINIS) WERE ENROLLED INTO AN 11-WEEK IHY PROGRAM CONSISTING OF 5 SESSIONS/WEEK FOR 90 MIN (55 SESSIONS). THE PROGRAM ADHERENCE, ASANA PERFORMANCE, AND WORK INTENSITY WERE ASSESSED ALONG THE INTERVENTION. ANTHROPOMETRIC [BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), % BODY FAT AND SIGMA SKIN FOLDS], CARDIOVASCULAR FITNESS [MAXIMAL EXPIRED AIR VOLUME (VE(MAX)), MAXIMAL O(2) CONSUMPTION (VO(2MAX)), MAXIMAL HEART RATE (HR(MAX)), SYSTOLIC (BPS) AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (BPD)], BIOCHEMICAL [GLUCOSE, TRIACYLGLYCEROLS (TAG), TOTAL CHOLESTEROL (TC), HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL (HDL-C), AND LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL (LDL-C)], AND DIETARY PARAMETERS WERE EVALUATED BEFORE AND AFTER IHY. RESULTS: DAILY CALORIC INTAKE (~1,916 KCAL/DAY), PROGRAM ADHERENCE (~85%), AND EXERCISING SKILLS (ASANA PERFORMANCE) WERE SIMILAR IN BOTH MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER WOMEN. THE IHY PROGRAM DID NOT MODIFY ANY ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS. HOWEVER, IT INCREASED VO(2MAX) AND VE(MAX) AND HDL-C WHILE TAG AND LDL-C REMAINED STABLE IN BOTH MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER GROUPS (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: THE PROPOSED IHY PROGRAM IMPROVES DIFFERENT CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS (NAMELY VO(2MAX) AND HDL-C) IN MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER WOMEN.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
5  741  24 EFFECT OF REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE ON RESPIRATORY REGULATION AND EXERCISE PERFORMANCE. YOGA ALTERS SPONTANEOUS RESPIRATORY REGULATION AND REDUCES HYPOXIC AND HYPERCAPNIC VENTILATORY RESPONSES. SINCE A LOWER VENTILATORY RESPONSE IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN IMPROVED ENDURANCE CAPACITY DURING WHOLE-BODY EXERCISE, WE TESTED WHETHER YOGIC SUBJECTS (YOGA) SHOW AN INCREASED ENDURANCE CAPACITY COMPARED TO MATCHED NON-YOGIC INDIVIDUALS (CON) WITH SIMILAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY LEVELS. RESTING VENTILATION, THE VENTILATORY RESPONSE TO HYPERCAPNIA, PASSIVE LEG MOVEMENT AND EXERCISE, AS WELL AS ENDURANCE PERFORMANCE WERE ASSESSED. YOGA (N = 9), COMPARED TO CONTROL (N = 6), HAD A HIGHER TIDAL VOLUME AT REST (0.7+/-0.2 VS. 0.5+/-0.1 L, P = 0.034) AND A REDUCED VENTILATORY RESPONSE TO HYPERCAPNIA (33+/-15 VS. 47+/-15 L.MIN(-1), P = 0.048). A YOGA SUBGROUP (N = 6) WITH MAXIMAL PERFORMANCE SIMILAR TO CONTROL SHOWED A BLUNTED VENTILATORY RESPONSE TO PASSIVE CYCLING (11+/-2 VS. 14+/-2 L.MIN(-1), P = 0.039) AND A TENDENCY TOWARDS LOWER EXERCISE VENTILATION (33+/-2 VS. 36+/-3 L.MIN(-1), P = 0.094) WHILE CYCLING ENDURANCE (YOGA: 17.3+/-3.3; CON: 19.6+/-8.5 MIN, P = 0.276) DID NOT DIFFER. THUS, YOGA PRACTICE WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED EXERCISE CAPACITY NOR WITH SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN EXERCISE VENTILATION DESPITE A SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT RESPIRATORY REGULATION AT REST AND IN RESPONSE TO HYPERCAPNIA AND PASSIVE LEG MOVEMENT.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
6 1612  37 METABOLIC ENERGY CONTRIBUTIONS DURING HIGH-INTENSITY HATHA YOGA AND PHYSIOLOGICAL COMPARISONS BETWEEN ACTIVE AND PASSIVE (SAVASANA) RECOVERY. PURPOSE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE METABOLIC ENERGY CONTRIBUTIONS DURING HIGH-INTENSITY HATHA YOGA (HIHY) AND TO COMPARE CHANGES IN PHYSIOLOGICAL VARIABLES BETWEEN ACTIVE AND PASSIVE RECOVERY METHODS. METHODS: THE STUDY INVOLVED 20 WOMEN YOGA INSTRUCTORS (N = 20) WHO PERFORMED 10 MIN OF HIHY (VIGOROUS SUN SALUTATION). UPON COMPLETION, THEY WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER ACTIVE (WALKING; N = 10) OR PASSIVE (SAVASANA; N = 10) RECOVERY GROUPS FOR A PERIOD OF 10 MIN. DURING HIHY, PHYSIOLOGICAL VARIABLES SUCH AS HEART RATE (HRPEAK AND HRMEAN), OXYGEN UPTAKE (VO2PEAK AND VO2MEAN), AND BLOOD LACTATE CONCENTRATIONS (PEAK LA(-)) WERE MEASURED. ENERGETIC CONTRIBUTIONS (PHOSPHAGEN; WPCR, GLYCOLYTIC; WGLY, AND OXIDATIVE; WOXI) IN KJ AND % WERE ESTIMATED USING VO2 AND LA(-) DATA. FURTHERMORE, THE METABOLIC EQUIVALENTS (METS) OF VO2PEAK AND VO2MEAN WERE CALCULATED. TO COMPARE DIFFERENT RECOVERY MODES, HRPOST, DELTAHR, VO2POST, DELTAVO2, RECOVERY LA(-), AND RECOVERY DELTALA(-) WERE ANALYZED. RESULTS: THE RESULTS REVEALED THAT HRPEAK, VO2PEAK, AND PEAK LA(-) DURING HIHY SHOWED NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS (P > 0.05). VALUES OF HRPEAK, HRMEAN, METS OF VO2PEAK AND VO2MEAN, AND LA(-) DURING HIHY WERE 95.6% OF HRMAX, 88.7% OF HRMAX, 10.54 +/- 1.18, 8.67 +/-.98 METS, AND 8.31 +/- 2.18 MMOL.L(-1), RESPECTIVELY. FURTHERMORE, WOXI WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER COMPARED WITH WPCR, WGLY, AND ANAEROBIC CONTRIBUTION (WPCR + WGLY), IN KJ AND % (P < 0.0001). VO2POST AND RECOVERY DELTALA(-) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN THE ACTIVE RECOVERY GROUP (P < 0.0001, P = 0.0369, RESPECTIVELY). VALUES OF DELTAVO2 AND RECOVERY LA(-) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN THE ACTIVE GROUP COMPARED WITH THE PASSIVE GROUP (P = 0.0115, P = 0.0291, RESPECTIVELY). CONCLUSIONS: THE STUDY CONCLUDED THAT HIGH-INTENSITY HATHA YOGA WHICH WAS PERFORMED FOR 10 MIN IS A SUITABLE OPTION FOR RELATIVELY HEALTHY PEOPLE IN THE MODERN WORKPLACE WHO MAY HAVE HATHA YOGA EXPERIENCE BUT DO NOT HAVE TIME TO PERFORM A PROLONGED EXERCISE. FOLLOWING ACTIVE RECOVERY, THEY CAN PARTICIPATE IN FURTHER HIHY SESSIONS DURING SHORT BREAKS. FURTHERMORE, A FASTER RETURN TO WORK CAN BE SUPPORTED BY PHYSIOLOGICAL RECOVERY.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
7  416  27 BODY TEMPERATURE AND ENERGY EXPENDITURE DURING AND AFTER YOGA BREATHING PRACTICES TRADITIONALLY DESCRIBED AS COOLING. BACKGROUND IN TRADITIONAL YOGA TEXTS, SHEETALI AND SITKARI PRANAYAMAS ARE DESCRIBED AS COOLING. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS AIMED AT RECORDING THE SURFACE BODY TEMPERATURE, OXYGEN CONSUMED, AND CARBON DIOXIDE ELIMINATED BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER PERFORMANCE OF SHEETALI AND SITKARI PRANAYAMAS. MATERIAL AND METHODS SEVENTEEN HEALTHY MALE VOLUNTEERS WITH AGES BETWEEN 19 TO 25 YEARS (AVERAGE AGE 20.7+/-1.8 YEARS) WERE ASSESSED IN 4 SESSIONS, VIZ. SHEETALI PRANAYAMA, SITKARI PRANAYAMA, BREATH AWARENESS AND QUIET LYING, ON 4 SEPARATE DAYS, IN RANDOM SEQUENCE. THE AXILLARY SURFACE BODY TEMPERATURE (TRUSCOPE II, SCHILLER, CHINA) AND METABOLIC VARIABLES (QUARK CPET, COSMED, ITALY) WERE RECORDED IN 3 PERIODS: BEFORE (5 MINUTES), DURING (18 MINUTES), AND AFTER (5 MINUTES), IN EACH OF THE 4 SESSIONS. THE HEAT INDEX WAS CALCULATED IN THE BEFORE AND AFTER PERIODS, BASED ON RECORDINGS OF AMBIENT TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING SPSS (VERSION 24.0). RESULTS BODY TEMPERATURE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING SHEETALI AND SITKARI (P<0.05, P<0.01; RESPECTIVELY) WHILE IT DECREASED AFTER BREATH AWARENESS AND QUIET LYING DOWN (P<0.01, P<0.001; RESPECTIVELY) WHEN COMPARED WITH RESPECTIVE POST-EXERCISE STATES. OXYGEN CONSUMPTION INCREASED BY 9.0% DURING SHEETALI (P<0.05) AND BY 7.6% DURING SITKARI (P<0.01) WHILE IT DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING (P<0.05) AND AFTER (P<0.01) QUIET LYING DOWN COMPARED TO RESPECTIVE PRE-EXERCISE STATES. CONCLUSIONS THE RESULTS DO NOT SUPPORT THE DESCRIPTION OF THESE YOGA BREATHING PRACTICES AS COOLING. THESE YOGA BREATHING PRACTICES MAY BE USED TO INDUCE A MILD HYPERMETABOLIC STATE.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
8 2396  16 YOGA AND CHEMOREFLEX RESPONSE TO HYPOXIA AND HYPERCAPNIA. WE TESTED WHETHER CHEMOREFLEX SENSITIVITY COULD BE AFFECTED BY THE PRACTICE OF YOGA, AND WHETHER THIS IS SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF A SLOW BREATHING RATE OBTAINED DURING YOGA OR AS A GENERAL CONSEQUENCE OF YOGA. WE FOUND THAT SLOW BREATHING RATE PER SE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED CHEMOREFLEX SENSITIVITY, BUT LONG-TERM YOGA PRACTICE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR A GENERALISED REDUCTION IN CHEMOREFLEX.	2000	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
9 2257  26 THE PHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATES OF KUNDALINI YOGA MEDITATION: A STUDY OF A YOGA MASTER. THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE PHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATES OF A HIGHLY PRACTICED KUNDALINI YOGA MEDITATOR. THORACIC AND ABDOMINAL BREATHING PATTERNS, HEART RATE (HR), OCCIPITAL PARIETAL ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPH (EEG), SKIN CONDUCTANCE LEVEL (SCL), AND BLOOD VOLUME PULSE (BVP) WERE MONITORED DURING PREBASELINE, MEDITATION, AND POSTBASELINE PERIODS. VISUAL ANALYSES OF THE DATA SHOWED A DECREASE IN RESPIRATION RATE DURING THE MEDITATION FROM A MEAN OF 11 BREATHS/MIN FOR THE PRE- AND 13 BREATHS/MIN FOR THE POSTBASELINE TO A MEAN OF 5 BREATHS/MIN DURING THE MEDITATION, WITH A PREDOMINANCE OF ABDOMINAL/DIAPHRAGMATIC BREATHING. THERE WAS ALSO MORE ALPHA EEG ACTIVITY DURING THE MEDITATION (M = 1.71 MICROV) COMPARED TO THE PRE- (M = .47 MICROV) AND POSTBASELINE (M = .78 MICROV) PERIODS, AND AN INCREASE IN THETA EEG ACTIVITY IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE MEDITATION (M = .62 MICROV) COMPARED TO THE PRE-BASELINE AND MEDITATIVE PERIODS (EACH WITH M = .26 MICROV). THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT A SHIFT IN BREATHING PATTERNS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALPHA EEG, AND THOSE PATTERNS NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED FURTHER.	2001	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
10 1029  25 EFFECTS OF YOGA EXERCISE ON SALIVARY BETA-DEFENSIN 2. PURPOSE: YOGA STRETCHING CAN BE DONE COMFORTABLY AND EASILY BY BEGINNERS AND OLDER ADULTS TO COMPENSATE FOR LACK OF EXERCISE OR POOR HEALTH MAINTENANCE. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA STRETCHING ON MUCOSAL IMMUNE FUNCTIONS, PRIMARILY HUMAN BETA-DEFENSIN 2 (HBD-2) IN SALIVA. METHODS: FIFTEEN HEALTHY ADULTS (AGE, 60.4 +/- 8.0 YEARS) PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY. PARTICIPANTS RESTED FOR 90 MIN ON THE FIRST DAY AND PERFORMED YOGA FOR 90 MIN ON THE SECOND DAY. MEASUREMENTS WERE CARRIED OUT BEFORE AND AFTER REST OR YOGA. SALIVA SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED BY CHEWING A STERILE COTTON AT A FREQUENCY OF 60 CYCLES PER MIN. SALIVARY HBD-2 CONCENTRATION WAS MEASURED USING AN ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY. RESULTS: HBD-2 CONCENTRATION AFTER YOGA STRETCHING (165.4 +/- 127.1 PG/ML) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT BEFORE YOGA STRETCHING (84.1 +/- 63.4 PG/ML; P < 0.01). HBD-2 EXPRESSION RATE AFTER YOGA STRETCHING (232.8 +/- 192.9 PG/MIN) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT BEFORE YOGA STRETCHING (110.7 +/- 96.8 PG/MIN; P < 0.01). HBD-2 CONCENTRATION (P < 0.05) AND HBD-2 EXPRESSION RATE (P < 0.01) AT POST ON THE SECOND DAY (YOGA) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT ON THE FIRST DAY (REST). POMS SCORE OF ANGER-HOSTILITY WAS LOWER AFTER YOGA THAN BEFORE. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA STRETCHING FOR 90 MIN CAN INCREASE SALIVARY HBD-2 EXPRESSION IN OLDER ADULTS. THEREFORE, YOGA STRETCHING MIGHT BE USEFUL FOR OLDER ADULTS AND ATHLETES TO MAINTAIN THEIR HEALTH.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
11  417  27 BODY TEMPERATURE IN PRACTITIONERS OF A YOGA BREATHING TECHNIQUE CONSIDERED TO BE HEAT GENERATING. CONTEXT: SURYABHEDA PRANAYAMA IS TRADITIONALLY DESCRIBED AS "INCREASING THE INNER FIRE" AND IS BELIEVED TO BE HEAT GENERATING. AIMS: THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED AT DETERMINING WHETHER THE SURFACE BODY TEMPERATURE WOULD INCREASE AFTER SURYABHEDA PRANAYAMA PRACTICE COMPARED WITH SITTING QUIETLY FOR THE SAME DURATION AS A CONTROL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: NINETEEN PARTICIPANTS WITH EXPERIENCE OF SURYABHEDA PRANAYAMA PRACTICE (GROUP MEAN EXPERIENCE +/- STANDARD DEVIATION, 30.2 +/- 22.8 MONTHS) WERE ASSESSED IN 3 SESSIONS ON SEPARATE DAYS. THE SESSIONS WERE (I) SURYABHEDA PRANAYAMA WITH PHYSIOLOGICAL LOCKS OR BREATH RETENTION, (II) SURYABHEDA PRANAYAMA WITHOUT PHYSIOLOGICAL LOCKS OR BREATH RETENTION, AND (III) QUIET SITTING (CONTROL SESSION). THE AXILLARY SURFACE BODY TEMPERATURE WAS MONITORED IN ALL THREE SESSIONS BEFORE (5 MIN), DURING (15 MIN), AND AFTER (5 MIN) THE INTERVENTION. AMBIENT TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY IN THE RECORDING CABIN USED FOR TESTING WERE NOTED. FROM THE AMBIENT TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY, THE HEAT INDEX WAS DERIVED. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSES OF VARIANCE WERE PERFORMED TO COMPARE VALUES BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER THE 3 SESSIONS, USING SPSS VERSION 24.0. RESULTS: THE SURFACE BODY TEMPERATURE INCREASED DURING AND AFTER SURYABHEDA PRANAYAMA WITH PHYSIOLOGICAL LOCKS (P < 0.001; P < 0.001), SURYABHEDA PRANAYAMA WITHOUT PHYSIOLOGICAL LOCKS (P < 0.01; P < 0.001), AND QUIET SITTING (P < 0.001; P < 0.001) COMPARED TO THE RESPECTIVE BEFORE VALUES. CONCLUSION: THE CONTROL (I.E., QUIET SITTING) AND EXPERIMENTAL SESSIONS (I.E., SURYABHEDA WITH LOCKS AND SURYABHEDA WITHOUT LOCKS) SHOWED A COMPARABLE INCREASE IN THE SURFACE BODY TEMPERATURE. HENCE, THE INCREASE IN SURFACE BODY TEMPERATURE DURING AND AFTER EXPERIMENTAL SESSIONS DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE RELATED TO THE PRANAYAMA TECHNIQUES. THE POSSIBLE FACTORS WHICH MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASED SURFACE BODY TEMPERATURE IN THE CONTROL AND EXPERIMENTAL SESSIONS HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
12 1365  22 IMPACT OF 10-WEEKS OF YOGA PRACTICE ON FLEXIBILITY AND BALANCE OF COLLEGE ATHLETES. BACKGROUND: WITH CLEARER EVIDENCE OF ITS BENEFITS, COACHES, AND ATHLETES MAY BETTER SEE THAT YOGA HAS A ROLE IN OPTIMIZING PERFORMANCE. AIMS: TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON MALE COLLEGE ATHLETES (N = 26). METHODS: OVER A 10-WEEK PERIOD, A YOGA GROUP (YG) OF ATHLETES (N = 14) TOOK PART IN BIWEEKLY YOGA SESSIONS; WHILE A NONYOGA GROUP (NYG) OF ATHLETES (N = 12) TOOK PART IN NO ADDITIONAL YOGA ACTIVITY. PERFORMANCE MEASURES WERE OBTAINED IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND AFTER THIS PERIOD. MEASUREMENTS OF FLEXIBILITY AND BALANCE, INCLUDED: SIT-REACH (SR), SHOULDER FLEXIBILITY (SF), AND STORK STAND (SS); DYNAMIC MEASUREMENTS CONSISTED OF JOINT ANGLES (JA) MEASURED DURING THE PERFORMANCE OF THREE DISTINCT YOGA POSITIONS (DOWNWARD DOG [DD]; RIGHT FOOT LUNGE [RFL]; CHAIR [C]). RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT GAINS WERE OBSERVED IN THE YG FOR FLEXIBILITY (SR, P = 0.01; SF, P = 0.03), AND BALANCE (SS, P = 0.05). NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED IN THE NYG FOR FLEXIBILITY AND BALANCE. SIGNIFICANTLY, GREATER JA WERE OBSERVED IN THE YG FOR: RFL (DORSIFLEXION, L-ANKLE; P = 0.04), DD (EXTENSION, R-KNEE, P = 0.04; R-HIP; P = 0.01; FLEXION, R-SHOULDER; P = 0.01) AND C (FLEXION, R-KNEE; P = 0.01). SIGNIFICANT JA DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED IN THE NYG FOR: DD (FLEXION, R-KNEE, P = 0.01: R-HIP, P = 0.05; R-SHOULDER, P = 0.03) AND C (FLEXION R-KNEE, P = 0.01; EXTENSION, R-SHOULDER; P = 0.05). A BETWEEN GROUP COMPARISON REVEALED THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES FOR: RFL (L-ANKLE; P = 0.01), DD (R-KNEE, P = 0.01; R-HIP; P = 0.01), AND C (R-SHOULDER, P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS SUGGEST THAT A REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE MAY INCREASE THE FLEXIBILITY AND BALANCE AS WELL AS WHOLE BODY MEASURES OF MALE COLLEGE ATHLETES AND THEREFORE, MAY ENHANCE ATHLETIC PERFORMANCES THAT REQUIRE THESE CHARACTERISTICS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
13  804  15 EFFECT OF YOGA ON AEROBIC AND ANAEROBIC POWER OF MUSCLES. AEROBIC POWER (VO2 MAX) AND ANAEROBIC POWER WERE ESTIMATED IN MEDICAL STUDENTS BEFORE AND AFTER SIX WEEKS OF YOGIC TRAINING. A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN AEROBIC POWER AND A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN ANAEROBIC POWER WAS OBSERVED. THIS MAY BE DUE TO CONVERSION OF SOME OF THE FAST TWITCH (F.T.) MUSCLE FIBRES INTO SLOW TWITCH FIBRES (S.T.) DURING YOGIC TRAINING.	1991	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
14 2160  25 THE EFFECTS OF WEIGHT BEARING YOGA TRAINING ON THE BONE RESORPTION MARKERS OF THE POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. THIS STUDY WAS A PRELIMINARY REPORT TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF THE WEIGHT BEARING YOGA TRAINING ON BOTH BONE RESORPTION MARKER AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF THE POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. THE SAMPLES WERE RECRUITED BY THE PURPOSIVE SAMPLING FROM THE FEMALE CHULALONGKORN UNIVERSITY STAFF AGED BETWEEN 50-60 YEARS. THE SUBJECTS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND CONTROL GROUP. THE BASELINE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA, THE BONE RESORPTION MARKER (BETA-CROSSLAPS), THE BONE FORMATION MARKER (P1NP) AND QUALITY OF LIFE (SF-36) DATA WERE COLLECTED. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP ATTENDED THE 12-WEEK WEIGHT-BEARING YOGA TRAINING 3 DAYS A WEEK, 50 MINUTES A DAY WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP LIVED THEIR NORMAL LIVES. AFTER 12TH WEEK, THE DATA COLLECTIONS WERE REPEATED IN BOTH GROUPS. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (19 SUBJECTS, THE MEAN AGE 54.320 YRS) AND THE CONTROL GROUP (14 SUBJECTS, THE MEAN AGE 54.430 YRS) WERE RECRUITED. THE MEAN ULTRASOUND BMD OF BOTH HEELS IN BOTH GROUPS SHOWED NO OSTEOPENIA OR OSTEOPOROSIS. AFTER THE 12-WEEK TRAINING, THE MEAN BONE RESORPTION MARKER (BETA-CROSSLAPS) OF THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP REDUCED FROM 0.464 TO 0.339 NG/ML (-26.939%) WHEREAS THE CONTROL GROUP REDUCED FROM 0.389 TO 0.386 NG/ML (-0.771%). THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE (P < 0.05). THE MEAN OF THE BONE FORMATION MARKERS (PINP) IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP REDUCED FROM 55.393 TO 42.401 NG/ML (-23.454%) AND THE BONE FORMATION MARKERS (PINP) IN THE CONTROL GROUP REDUCED FROM 61.903 TO 44.832 NG/ML (-27.577%). IN THE AREA OF THE LIFE QUALITY MEASUREMENT OF BOTH GROUPS, THE DATA OBTAINED FROM THE MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY SHORT-FORM SURVEY (SF-36) SHOWED THAT THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AT 0.05 LEVELS FOR THE PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING, BODILY PAIN, GENERAL HEALTH, AND VITALITY. THE VARIANCE OF PERCENTAGE CHANGE VALUE OF THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP INCREASED TO +25.299, +16.565, +15.309, AND +21.056. THE VARIANCE OF PERCENTAGE CHANGE VALUE OF THE CONTROL GROUP INCREASED TO +12.946, -1.221, -9.303 AND +2.291. THE WEIGH-BEARING YOGA TRAINING HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON BONE BY SLOWING DOWN BONE RESORPTION WHICH WAS A VERY ESSENTIAL INDICATOR FOR HUMAN HEALTH BECAUSE IT REDUCED THE OSTEOPOROSIS RISKS IN THE POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. ADDITIONALLY, YOGA TRAINING PROMOTED BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
15 1680  35 ONE YEAR OF YOGA TRAINING ALTERS GHRELIN AXIS IN CENTRALLY OBESE ADULTS WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME. INTRODUCTION: METABOLIC SYNDROME (METS) IS A MULTIPLEX CARDIOMETABOLIC MANIFESTATION ASSOCIATED WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES. YOGA TRAINING HAS BEEN SHOWN TO ALLEVIATE METS. RECENTLY, CIRCULATORY GHRELIN PROFILE WAS DEMONSTRATED TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH METS. THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF 1 YEAR OF YOGA TRAINING ON BETA-CELL FUNCTION AND INSULIN RESISTANCE, AND THE INVOLVEMENT OF METABOLIC PEPTIDES, INCLUDING UNACYLATED GHRELIN (UNAG), ACYLATED GHRELIN (AG), OBESTATIN, GROWTH HORMONE (GH), AND INSULIN, IN THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA TRAINING IN CENTRALLY OBESE ADULTS WITH METS. METHODS: THIS WAS A FOLLOW UP STUDY, IN WHICH DATA OF RISK FACTORS OF METS, PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE TESTS [RESTING HEART RATE (HR), CHAIR STAND TEST (CS), CHAIR SIT AND REACH TEST (CSR), BACK SCRATCH TEST (BS), AND SINGLE LEG STAND TESTS (SLS)] AND SERUM SAMPLES OF 79 CENTRALLY OBESE METS SUBJECTS AGED 58 +/- 8 YEARS (39 SUBJECTS RECEIVED 1-YEAR YOGA TRAINING AND 40 SUBJECTS RECEIVED NO TRAINING) WERE RETRIEVED FOR ANALYSES. BETA-CELL FUNCTION AND INSULIN RESISTANCE WERE EXAMINED BY HOMEOSTASIS MODEL ASSESSMENT (HOMA). CIRCULATING LEVELS OF UNAG, AG, OBESTATIN, GH, AND INSULIN WERE DETERMINED BY ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY USING FASTING SERUM SAMPLES. GENERALIZED ESTIMATING EQUATION ANALYSIS AND MANN-WHITNEY U-TEST WERE USED TO DETECT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS. RESULTS: WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE (WC) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED AFTER YOGA INTERVENTION (CONTROL: +2%; YOGA: -4%). SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN HR (CONTROL: +2%; YOGA: -5%), CS (CONTROL: -1%; YOGA: +24%), CSR LEFT (CONTROL: WORSEN BY 0.90 CM; YOGA: IMPROVED BY 4.21 CM), CSR RIGHT (CONTROL: WORSEN BY 0.75 CM; YOGA: IMPROVED BY 4.28 CM), RIGHT SIDE OF BS (CONTROL: IMPROVED BY 0.19 CM; YOGA: IMPROVED BY 4.31 CM), SLS LEFT (CONTROL: -10%; YOGA: +86%), AND SLS RIGHT (CONTROL: -6%; YOGA: +47%) WERE OBSERVED AFTER 1-YEAR YOGA TRAINING. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS IN INSULIN, HOMA INDICES, AND DISPOSITION INDEX. YOGA TRAINING SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED CIRCULATING GH (CONTROL: -3%; YOGA: +22%), TOTAL CIRCULATING GHRELIN (CONTROL: -26%; YOGA: +13%), AND UNAG (CONTROL: -27%; YOGA: +14%), WHEREAS DECREASED AG (CONTROL: -7%; YOGA: -33%) AND OBESTATIN (CONTROL: +24%; YOGA: -29%). CONCLUSION: ONE-YEAR OF YOGA TRAINING MODULATED TOTAL GHRELIN, UNAG, AG, OBESTATIN, AND GH WHILE EXERTING BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON PHYSICAL FUNCTIONS AND CENTRAL OBESITY IN ADULTS WITH METS. THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ALTERATION OF GHRELIN GENE PRODUCT AND GH.	2018	

16 1095  23 EFFECTS OF YOGA PRACTICE ON MUSCULAR ENDURANCE IN YOUNG WOMEN. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO VERIFY THE EFFECTS OF A SYSTEMATIZED YOGA PRACTICE ON MUSCULAR ENDURANCE IN YOUNG WOMEN. TWENTY SIX WOMEN (24 +/- 3.5 YEARS OLD) PARTICIPATED IN SIX WEEKS OF YOGA CLASSES, AND TWENTY ONE WOMEN (25 +/- 5.1 YEARS OLD) PARTICIPATED AS THE CONTROL GROUP. THE YOGA INTERVENTION WAS COMPOSED OF EIGHTEEN SESSIONS, THREE TIMES PER WEEK, AT 1 H PER SESSION. THE MUSCULAR ENDURANCE OF UPPER LIMBS (PUSH-UP) AND ABDOMINAL (SIT-UP) WAS ASSESSED THROUGH THE PROTOCOL SUGGESTED BY GETTMAN (1989) [1] AND GOLDING, MYERS AND SINNING (1989) [2] TO THE MAXIMUM REPETITIONS PERFORMED IN 1 MIN. TO VERIFY THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES INTRA GROUPS AND BETWEEN GROUPS A SPANOVA WAS PERFORMED, AND THE LEVEL OF SIGNIFICANCE WAS P </= 0.05. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA PROVIDES IMPROVEMENT IN UPPER LIMB AND IN ABDOMINAL MUSCULAR ENDURANCE.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
17  918  24 EFFECTIVENESS OF TRAINING PROGRAM COMBINING CHAKRAYOGA AND MEDITATION. BACKGROUND THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PROGRAM COMBINING CHAKRAYOGA AND MEDITATION ON THE PHYSICAL HEALTH AND DISEASE-RELATED FACTORS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS OF PEOPLE. METHODS NINETY-SEVEN SUBJECTS (32-83 YEARS OLD) WHO HAD FREE FROM PRIOR EXPERIENCES IN MEDITATION PROGRAMS OR CHAKRAYOGA TRAINING COURSES WERE ASSIGNED TO EITHER THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (EXP) (45 SUBJECTS; 13 MALE SUBJECTS AND 32 FEMALE SUBJECTS; AVERAGE AGE OF 60.67 YEARS, SD=11.09 YEARS) OR THE CONTROL GROUP (CONT) OF REMAINING SUBJECTS (52 SUBJECTS; 14 MALE SUBJECTS AND 38 FEMALE SUBJECTS; AVERAGE AGE OF 61.58 YEARS, SD=9.70 YEARS). SUBJECTS IN THE EXP PARTICIPATED IN THE CHAKRAYOGA MEDITATION PROGRAM FOR TWICE A WEEK FOR 2 H DURING 6 WEEKS IN EACH SESSION CONSISTED OF 1 H OF CHAKRAYOGA AND 1 H OF MEDITATION. THE MEASUREMENTS IN THIS STUDY INCLUDED THE MINDFULNESS, STRESS RESPONSE, SUBJECTIVE QUALITY OF LIFE, MEDICAL SYMPTOM CHECKLIST, DIFFICULTY IN EMOTIONAL REGULATION AND OBJECTIVE OF LIFE AND SENSE OF CONTROL. RESULTS RESULTS REVEALED THAT PARTICIPANTS IN THE EXP REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE RELIEF OF MINDFULNESS, STRESS RESPONSE, SUBJECTIVE QUALITY OF LIFE AND MEDICAL SYMPTOM CHECKLIST THAN THOSE IN THE CONT. CONCLUSIONS THESE FINDINGS PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT THE CHAKRAYOGA MEDITATION PROGRAM CAN HELP RELIEVE THE PHYSICAL HEALTH AND DISEASE-RELATED FACTORS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
18  837  25 EFFECT OF YOGA ON PERFORMANCE AND PHYSICAL FITNESS IN CRICKET BOWLERS. CRICKET-BOWLING PERFORMANCE IS KNOWN TO BE INFLUENCED BY SPEED OF BALL RELEASE AND ACCURACY. CURRENTLY, TRAINING SESSIONS TYPICALLY INVOLVE FIELDING-SPECIFIC DRILLS AND CONDITIONING EXERCISES. SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE FOR INCLUSION OF A COMPREHENSIVE YOGA INTERVENTION IN DAILY TRAINING AND EXERCISE SESSIONS REMAINS UNEXPLORED. THE PRESENT STUDY EXPLORED THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON BOWLING PERFORMANCE AND PHYSICAL FITNESS IN CRICKET BOWLERS. SPORTS FITNESS TESTING AND TRAINING WERE CONDUCTED AMONG 60 NON-ELITE RECREATIONAL-CLUB MALE CRICKET PLAYERS AGED 13-25 YEARS. CRICKET-BOWLING SPEED WAS E VALUATED USING A SPEED RADAR GUN, ACCURACY WITH A TEST DEVELOPED BY PORTUS ET AL., CARDIORESPIRATORY ENDURANCE USING THE YO-YO INTERMITTENT RECOVERY TEST, LOWER-EXTREMITY AND TRUNK STRENGTH USING A BACK-LEG DYNAMOMETER, UPPER-LIMB POWER USING A MEDICINE BALL-THROW TEST, POWER USING A VERTICAL-JUMP TEST, AND FLEXIBILITY USING A SIT-AND-REACH TEST. IN ADDITION TO BOWLING PRACTICE, THE YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 30) PERFORMED PRANAYAMA AND STANDING AND PRONE ASANA, WHEREAS THE CONTROL GROUP (N = 30) PRACTICED CONVENTIONAL CONDITIONING EXERCISES, FOR 45 MINUTES/DAY, THREE TIMES A WEEK, FOR 12 WEEKS. IMPROVEMENT IN BOWLING SPEED, ACCURACY, CARDIORESPIRATORY ENDURANCE, MUSCLE STRENGTH, AND FLEXIBILITY WERE COMPARABLE BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN BASELINE SCORES IN BOWLING SPEED, ACCURACY, CARDIORESPIRATORY ENDURANCE, MUSCLE FLEXIBILITY, STRENGTH, AND POWER WERE COMPARABLE BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS OF NON-ELITE MALE CRICKET PLAYERS. BOWLING SPEED IMPROVED BY 6.52% IN THE YOGA GROUP AND BY 5.18% IN THE CONTROL GROUP. BOWLING ACCURACY IMPROVED BY 35.40% IN THE YOGA GROUP AND BY 31.29% IN THE CONTROL GROUP. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH ON LONG-DURATION INTERVENTION IN ELITE PLAYERS MAY HELP TO ESTABLISH THE ROLE OF YOGA IN CONVENTIONAL CRICKET-BOWLING TRAINING.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
19  887  16 EFFECT OF YOGA TYPE BREATHING ON HEART RATE AND CARDIAC AXIS OF NORMAL SUBJECTS. EFFECT OF INSPIRATORY AND EXPIRATORY PHASES OF NORMAL QUIET BREATHING, DEEP BREATHING AND SAVITRI PRANAYAM TYPE BREATHING ON HEART RATE AND MEAN VENTRICULAR QRS AXIS WAS INVESTIGATED IN YOUNG, HEALTHY UNTRAINED SUBJECTS. PRANAYAM TYPE BREATHING PRODUCED SIGNIFICANT CARDIOACCELERATION AND INCREASE IN QRS AXIS DURING THE INSPIRATORY PHASE AS COMPARED TO EUPNEA. ON THE OTHER HAND, EXPIRATORY EFFORT DURING PRANAYAM TYPE BREATHING DID NOT PRODUCE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN HEART RATE OR QRS AXIS. THE CHANGES IN HEART RATE AND QRS AXIS DURING THE INSPIRATORY AND EXPIRATORY PHASES OF PRANAYAM TYPE BREATHING WERE SIMILAR TO THE CHANGES OBSERVED DURING THE CORRESPONDING PHASES OF DEEP BREATHING.	1986	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
20  642  55 DOES PRACTICING HATHA YOGA SATISFY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INTENSITY OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WHICH IMPROVES AND MAINTAINS HEALTH AND CARDIOVASCULAR FITNESS? BACKGROUND: LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE METABOLIC AND HEART RATE RESPONSES TO A TYPICAL HATHA YOGA SESSION. THE PURPOSES OF THIS STUDY WERE 1) TO DETERMINE WHETHER A TYPICAL YOGA PRACTICE USING VARIOUS POSTURES MEETS THE CURRENT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR LEVELS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY REQUIRED TO IMPROVE AND MAINTAIN HEALTH AND CARDIOVASCULAR FITNESS; 2) TO DETERMINE THE RELIABILITY OF METABOLIC COSTS OF YOGA ACROSS SESSIONS; 3) TO COMPARE THE METABOLIC COSTS OF YOGA PRACTICE TO THOSE OF TREADMILL WALKING. METHODS: IN THIS OBSERVATIONAL STUDY, 20 INTERMEDIATE-TO-ADVANCED LEVEL YOGA PRACTITIONERS, AGE 31.4 +/- 8.3 YEARS, PERFORMED AN EXERCISE ROUTINE INSIDE A HUMAN RESPIRATORY CHAMBER (INDIRECT CALORIMETER) WHILE WEARING HEART RATE MONITORS. THE EXERCISE ROUTINE CONSISTED OF 30 MINUTES OF SITTING, 56 MINUTES OF BEGINNER-LEVEL HATHA YOGA ADMINISTERED BY VIDEO, AND 10 MINUTES OF TREADMILL WALKING AT 3.2 AND 4.8 KPH EACH. MEASURES WERE MEAN OXYGEN CONSUMPTION (VO2), HEART RATE (HR), PERCENTAGE PREDICTED MAXIMAL HEART RATE (%MHR), METABOLIC EQUIVALENTS (METS), AND ENERGY EXPENDITURE (KCAL). SEVEN SUBJECTS REPEATED THE PROTOCOL SO THAT MEASUREMENT RELIABILITY COULD BE ESTABLISHED. RESULTS: MEAN VALUES ACROSS THE ENTIRE YOGA SESSION FOR VO2, HR, %MHR, METS, AND ENERGY/MIN WERE 0.6 L/KG/MIN; 93.2 BEATS/MIN; 49.4%; 2.5; AND 3.2 KCAL/MIN; RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS OF THE ICCS (2,1) FOR MEAN VALUES ACROSS THE ENTIRE YOGA SESSION FOR KCAL, METS, AND %MHR WERE 0.979 AND 0.973, AND 0.865, RESPECTIVELY. CONCLUSION: METABOLIC COSTS OF YOGA AVERAGED ACROSS THE ENTIRE SESSION REPRESENT LOW LEVELS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, ARE SIMILAR TO WALKING ON A TREADMILL AT 3.2 KPH, AND DO NOT MEET RECOMMENDATIONS FOR LEVELS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOR IMPROVING OR MAINTAINING HEALTH OR CARDIOVASCULAR FITNESS. YOGA PRACTICE INCORPORATING SUN SALUTATION POSTURES EXCEEDING THE MINIMUM BOUT OF 10 MINUTES MAY CONTRIBUTE SOME PORTION OF SUFFICIENTLY INTENSE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO IMPROVE CARDIO-RESPIRATORY FITNESS IN UNFIT OR SEDENTARY INDIVIDUALS. THE MEASUREMENT OF ENERGY EXPENDITURE ACROSS YOGA SESSIONS IS HIGHLY RELIABLE.	2007

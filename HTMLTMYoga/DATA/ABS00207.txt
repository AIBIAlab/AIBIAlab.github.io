1  207 109 A SHORT-TERM, COMPREHENSIVE, YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION IS EFFICACIOUS IN REDUCING ANXIETY, IMPROVING SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING AND PERSONALITY. OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF A SHORT-TERM COMPREHENSIVE YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION IN REDUCING ANXIETY, IMPROVING SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING AND PERSONALITY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE STUDY IS A PART OF AN ONGOING LARGER STUDY AT A TERTIARY CARE HOSPITAL. PARTICIPANTS (N=90) INCLUDED PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC DISEASES ATTENDING A 10-DAY, YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION PROGRAM FOR PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC DISEASES, AND HEALTHY CONTROLS (N=45) NOT ATTENDING ANY SUCH INTERVENTION. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: CHANGE IN STATE AND TRAIT ANXIETY QUESTIONNAIRE (STAI-Y; 40 ITEMS), SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING INVENTORY (SUBI; 40 ITEMS), AND NEUROTICISM EXTRAVERSION OPENNESS TO EXPERIENCE FIVE FACTOR PERSONALITY INVENTORY REVISED (NEO-FF PI-R; 60 ITEMS) AT THE END OF INTERVENTION. RESULTS: FOLLOWING INTERVENTION, THE STAI-Y SCORES REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY (P<0.001) AT DAY 10 (66.7 +/- 13.0) VERSUS DAY 1 (72.5 +/- 14.7). ALSO, POSITIVE SUBI SCORES (F1- F6) IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY (P<0.01) AT DAY 10 VERSUS DAY 1. SIMILARLY NEO-FF PI-R SCORES IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY (P<0.001) AT DAY 10 VERSUS DAY 1. CONTROL GROUP SHOWED AN INCREASE IN STAI-Y WHILE SUBI AND NEO-FF PI-R SCORES REMAINED COMPARABLE AT DAY 10 VERSUS DAY 1. CONCLUSIONS: THE OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT A SHORT-TERM, YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION MAY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE ANXIETY AND IMPROVE SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING AND PERSONALITY IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC DISEASES.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
2  412  24 BLOOD PRESSURE EFFECTS OF YOGA, ALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH LIFESTYLE MEASURES: RESULTS OF THE LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AND BLOOD PRESSURE STUDY (LIMBS). THE AUTHORS CONDUCTED A STUDY TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON BLOOD PRESSURE (BP). PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA (BLOOD PRESSURE EDUCATION PROGRAM [BPEP]), OR A COMBINED PROGRAM (COMBO). AMBULATORY BP WAS MEASURED AT BASELINE AND AT 12 AND 24 WEEKS. DATA ARE PRESENTED FOR ALL ENROLLED PATIENTS (N=137) AND FOR COMPLETERS ONLY (N=90). SYSTOLIC BP (SBP) AND DIASTOLIC BP (DBP) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED WITHIN ALL GROUPS AT 12 AND 24 WEEKS (P<.001) FOR ENROLLED PATIENTS AND COMPLETERS. SBP WAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED IN THE YOGA AND COMBO GROUPS AS COMPARED WITH THE BPEP GROUP AT 12 WEEKS IN ALL ENROLLED AND COMPLETERS. SBP DIFFERENCES WERE NO LONGER SIGNIFICANT AT 24 WEEKS BETWEEN GROUPS IN ALL ENROLLED PATIENTS; HOWEVER, THERE WAS A GREATER REDUCTION IN SBP AT 24 WEEKS IN COMPLETERS FAVORING BPEP OVER YOGA. NO DIFFERENCES IN DBP BETWEEN GROUPS OR IN BP BETWEEN THE YOGA AND COMBO GROUPS WERE PRESENT. THE AUTHORS DID NOT OBSERVE AN ADDITIVE BENEFIT FROM COMBINING YOGA WITH BPEP MEASURES. REASONS FOR THIS ARE UNCLEAR AT THIS TIME. BP LOWERING WITH YOGA, HOWEVER, WAS SIMILAR TO THAT ACHIEVED WITH LIFESTYLE MEASURES.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
3  277  28 ADDITIONAL PRACTICE OF YOGA BREATHING WITH INTERMITTENT BREATH HOLDING ENHANCES PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS IN YOGA PRACTITIONERS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: THE PRACTICE OF YOGA IS ASSOCIATED WITH ENHANCED PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING. THE CURRENT STUDY ASSESSED THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE DURATION OF YOGA PRACTICE WITH STATE MINDFULNESS, MIND-WANDERING AND STATE ANXIETY. ALSO, WE EXAMINED IF AN ADDITIONAL 20 MIN OF YOGA BREATHING WITH INTERMITTENT BREATH HOLDING (EXPERIMENTAL GROUP) FOR 8 WEEKS WOULD AFFECT THESE PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIABLES MORE THAN REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE (CONTROL GROUP) ALONE. METHODS: ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN SUBJECTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EXPERIMENTAL (N = 60) AND CONTROL (N = 56) GROUPS. STATE MINDFULNESS ATTENTION AWARENESS SCALE (SMAAS), MIND-WANDERING QUESTIONNAIRE (MWQ) AND STATE ANXIETY INVENTORY WERE ADMINISTERED AT BASELINE AND AT THE END OF 8 WEEKS. RESULTS: BASELINE ASSESSMENT REVEALED A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN DURATION OF YOGA PRACTICE WITH SMAAS SCORES AND NEGATIVE CORRELATION WITH MWQ AND STATE ANXIETY SCORES. AT THE END OF 8 WEEKS, BOTH GROUPS DEMONSTRATED ENHANCED PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS, BUT THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP RECEIVING ADDITIONAL YOGA BREATHING PERFORMED BETTER THAN THE GROUP PRACTICING YOGA ALONE. CONCLUSION: AN ADDITIONAL PRACTICE OF YOGA BREATHING WITH INTERMITTENT BREATH HOLDING WAS FOUND TO ENHANCE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS IN YOUNG ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
4  830  34 EFFECT OF YOGA ON MENTAL HEALTH: COMPARATIVE STUDY BETWEEN YOUNG AND SENIOR SUBJECTS IN JAPAN. BACKGROUND: JAPAN HAS A LARGE NUMBER OF SENIOR CITIZENS. YOGA CAN BE WISELY APPLIED IN OLD AGE CARE. THERE IS NO ANY AGE RESTRICTION TO PRACTICE YOGA. THE EFFECT MAY DIFFER BY AGE. THERE IS A NEED TO STUDY THE MECHANISM OF ACTION OF YOGA WITH RESPECT TO AGE. AIM: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN JAPAN TO FIND THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON MENTAL HEALTH BETWEEN YOUNG AND SENIOR PEOPLE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TWENTY-FIVE NORMAL HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS OF BOTH SEXES WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS ACCORDING TO AGE. FIFTEEN PARTICIPANTS OF THE AGE GROUP BETWEEN 65 TO 75 YEARS AND 10 PARTICIPANTS OF THE AGE GROUP BETWEEN 20 TO 30 YEARS WERE SELECTED. THIS STUDY WAS APPROVED BY THE ETHICAL COMMITTEE OF KAWASAKI UNIVERSITY OF MEDICAL WELFARE. SELECTED INDIVIDUALS WERE SUBJECTED TO 90 MIN OF YOGA CLASSES ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK FOR A MONTH. SALIVARY AMYLASE ACTIVITY WAS ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA PRACTICE. STATE TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY (STAI) WAS GIVEN BEFORE YOGA ON THE FIRST DAY AND AFTER ONE MONTH OF PRACTICE TO ASSESS THE CHANGE IN STATE ANXIETY AND TRAIT ANXIETY. RESULTS: SENIOR GROUP - SALIVARY AMYLASE ACTIVITY DECREASED FROM 111.2+/-42.7 TO 83.48+/-39.5 KU/L [AVERAGE+/-STANDARD DEVIATION]. YOUNGER GROUP - SALIVARY AMYLASE ACTIVITY REDUCED FROM 60.74+/-31.8 TO 42.39+/-24 KU/L. SENIOR GROUP - STATE ANXIETY SCORE DECREASED FROM 41.13 +/-8.43 TO 30.8+/-6.49, TRAIT ANXIETY SCORE REDUCED FROM 45.66+/-7.5 TO 40.73+/-8.3. YOUNGER GROUP - STATE ANXIETY SCORE REDUCED FROM 38.7+/-4.8 TO 30.8+/-4.1,TRAIT ANXIETY SCORE REDUCED FROM 46.2+/-7.9 TO 42.9+/-9.1. CHANGES WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT WITH P<0.05. CONCLUSION: DECREASE IN SALIVARY AMYLASE ACTIVITY MAY BE DUE TO REDUCTION IN SYMPATHETIC RESPONSE. REDUCTION IN STATE AND TRAIT ANXIETY SCORE SIGNIFIES THAT YOGA HAS BOTH IMMEDIATE AS WELL AS LONG-TERM EFFECT ON ANXIETY REDUCTION. THUS YOGA HELPS TO IMPROVE THE MENTAL HEALTH IN BOTH THE GROUPS.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
5 2173  21 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON DYSPNEA, SLEEP AND FATIGUE IN CHRONIC RESPIRATORY DISEASES. PURPOSE: THIS STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT TO FIND OUT THE EFFECTS OF YOGA APPLIED TO CHRONIC RESPIRATORY DISEASE PATIENTS ON DYSPNEA, SLEEP QUALITY AND FATIGUE. MATERIAL AND METHOD: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED BETWEEN MAY AND AUGUST 2020 AS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. 'PERSONAL INFORMATION FORM', 'RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS MONITORING FORM', 'COPD AND ASTHMA FATIGUE SCALE (CAFS), "ASTHMA AND COPD SLEEP IMPACT SCALE (CASIS)" AND MODIFIED MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL DYSPNEA SCALE (MMRC) WERE USED IN DATA COLLECTION. RESULTS: WHEN THE POST-TEST MEAN SCORES OF THE PATIENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUP WERE COMPARED, IT WAS FOUND THAT CAFS, CASIS AND MMRC MEAN SCORES OF THE PATIENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP DECREASED POSITIVELY COMPARED TO THE PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WAS FOUND TO BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: YOGA HAS BEEN FOUND TO REDUCE THE SEVERITY OF DYSPNEA AND FATIGUE AND IMPROVE SLEEP QUALITY IN CHRONIC RESPIRATORY DISEASES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
6  712  25 EFFECT OF INTEGRATED YOGA ON ANTI-PSYCHOTIC INDUCED SIDE EFFECTS AND COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM SCHIZOPHRENIA. BACKGROUND TWENTY ONE (12 FEMALES) SUBJECTS, DIAGNOSED WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA BY A PSYCHIATRIST USING ICD-10, IN THE AGES 52.87 + 9.5YEARS AND SUFFERING SINCE 24.0 +/- 3.05YEARS WERE RECRUITED INTO THE STUDY FROM A SCHIZOPHRENIA REHABILITATION CENTER IN BENGALURU. METHODS ALL SUBJECTS WERE TAKING ANTI-PSYCHOTIC MEDICATIONS AND WERE IN STABLE STATE FOR MORE THAN A MONTH. PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATIONS WERE KEPT CONSTANT DURING THE STUDY PERIOD. ASSESSMENTS WERE DONE AT THREE POINTS OF TIME: (1) BASELINE, (2) AFTER ONE MONTH OF USUAL ROUTINE (PRE) AND (3) AFTER FIVE MONTHS OF VALIDATED INTEGRATED YOGA (IY) INTERVENTION (POST). VALIDATED 1H YOGA MODULE (CONSISTING OF ASANAS, PRANAYAMA, RELAXATION TECHNIQUES AND CHANTINGS) WAS PRACTICED FOR 5MONTHS, FIVE SESSIONS PER WEEK. ANTIPSYCHOTIC-INDUCED SIDE EFFECTS WERE ASSESSED USING SIMPSON ANGUS SCALE (SAS) AND UDVALG FOR KLINISKE UNDERSOGELSER (UKU) SIDE EFFECT RATING SCALE. COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS (USING TRAIL MAKING TEST A AND B), CLINICAL SYMPTOMS AND ANTHROPOMETRY WERE ASSESSED AS SECONDARY VARIABLES. COMPARISONS BETWEEN "PRE" AND "POST" DATA WAS DONE USING PAIRED SAMPLES T-TESTS AFTER SUBTRACTING BASELINE SCORES FROM THEM RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS AT THE END OF FIVE MONTHS, SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DRUG-INDUCED PARKINSONIAN SYMPTOMS (SAS SCORE; P=0.001) AND 38 ITEMS OF UKU SCALE WAS OBSERVED ALONG WITH SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PROCESSING SPEED, EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS AND NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA PATIENTS. NO SIDE EFFECTS OF YOGA WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS THE PRESENT STUDY PROVIDES PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE FOR USEFULNESS OF INTEGRATED YOGA INTERVENTION IN MANAGING ANTI-PSYCHOTIC-INDUCED SIDE EFFECTS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
7 2653  40 YOGA IMPROVES OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE, DEPRESSION, AND DAILY ACTIVITIES FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC PAIN IS A COMPLEX ACCUMULATION OF PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS, THUS INTERVENTIONS THAT ADDRESS PAIN AND PROMOTE OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE ARE NEEDED. A HOLISTIC INTERVENTION, WITH MIND AND BODY COMPONENTS, IS LIKELY NECESSARY TO BEST TREAT THE COMPLEXITIES OF CHRONIC PAIN. THUS, WE DEVELOPED AND TESTED A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN. OBJECTIVES: IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL (RCT), PARTICIPANTS WITH CHRONIC PAIN WERE RANDOMIZED TO A YOGA INTERVENTION OR USUAL CARE GROUP. BETWEEN AND WITHIN GROUP DIFFERENCES FOR PRE-AND POST-OUTCOME MEASURE SCORES WERE ASSESSED FOR: OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE, COMPLETION OF ACTIVITIES, AND DEPRESSION. METHODS: PILOT RCT WITH PARTICIPANT ALLOCATION TO 8 WEEKS OF YOGA OR USUAL CARE. BOTH GROUPS RECEIVED ONGOING MONTHLY SELF-MANAGEMENT PROGRAMMING. DATA WERE COLLECTED BEFORE AND AFTER THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA OR USUAL CARE AFTER BASELINE ASSESSMENTS. DEMOGRAPHICS WERE COLLECTED AND MEASURES INCLUDED: CANADIAN OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE MEASURE (COPM) TO ASSESS OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE; THE 15-ITEM FRENCHAY ACTIVITIES INDEX (FAI)(ACTIVITIES); AND THE 9-ITEM PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE (PHQ-9) FOR DEPRESSION. INDEPENDENT T-TESTS WERE USED TO ASSESS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS. PAIRED T-TESTS WERE USED TO ASSESS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRE- AND POST 8-WEEK INTERVENTION FOR BOTH THE YOGA AND THE USUAL CARE GROUPS. PERCENT CHANGE SCORES AND EFFECT SIZES WERE CALCULATED. RESULTS: 83 PEOPLE WERE RECRUITED FOR THE STUDY AND COMPLETED BASELINE ASSESSMENTS; 44 INDIVIDUALS WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA AND 39 TO THE CONTROL GROUP. THE AVERAGE AGE OF ALL PARTICIPANTS WAS 51.4+/-10.5 YEARS, 68% WERE FEMALE; AND 60% HAD AT LEAST SOME COLLEGE EDUCATION. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN DEMOGRAPHICS OR OUTCOME MEASURES BETWEEN GROUPS AT BASELINE OR 8 WEEKS; HOWEVER, THE STUDY WAS NOT POWERED TO SEE SUCH DIFFERENCES. INDIVIDUALS RANDOMIZED TO THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE IN ANY OUTCOME MEASURE OVER THE 8 WEEKS. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN COPM PERFORMANCE AND COPM SATISFACTION SCORES FOR INDIVIDUALS RANDOMIZED TO THE YOGA GROUP; BOTH SCORES SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED. COPM PERFORMANCE IMPROVED BY 27% WITH A MODERATE TO LARGE EFFECT SIZE (3.66+/-1.85 VS 4.66+/-1.93, P < 0.001, D = 0.76). COPM SATISFACTION SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED BY 78% (2.14+/-2.31 VS. 3.80+/-2.50, P < 0.001) AND HAD A LARGE EFFECTS SIZE (D = 1.02). FAI SCORES IMPROVED, INDICATING INCREASED ACTIVITY OR ENGAGEMENT IN DAILY OCCUPATION DURING THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION. SCORES INCREASED BY 5% (38.13+/-8.48 VS. 39.90+/-8.57, P = 0.024) WITH A SMALL EFFECT SIZE (D = 0.37). DEPRESSION SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED FROM 13.21+/-5.60 TO 11.41+/-5.82, P = 0.041, WITH A SMALL EFFECT SIZE. CONCLUSION: DATA FROM THIS PILOT RCT INDICATE YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION WITH PEOPLE IN CHRONIC PAIN TO IMPROVE OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE, INCREASE ENGAGEMENT IN ACTIVITIES, AND DECREASE DEPRESSION. OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY PRACTITIONERS MAY CONSIDER ADDING YOGA AS A TREATMENT INTERVENTION TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH PAIN.	2019	

8 1571  30 MANAGEMENT OF MYOFASCIAL PAIN DYSFUNCTION SYNDROME WITH MEDITATION AND YOGA: HEALING THROUGH NATURAL THERAPY. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY WERE TO STUDY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RAJ-YOGA MEDITATION AND PRANAYAMA IN PATIENTS WITH MYOFASCIAL PAIN DYSFUNCTION SYNDROME (MPDS) AND COMPARED THE EFFECTS WITH ONGOING CONVENTIONAL NONINVASIVE TREATMENT MODALITIES. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE STUDY COMPRISED 30 PATIENTS DIVIDED EQUALLY (10 EACH) INTO 3 GROUP, I.E., CONTROL GROUP (CONVENTIONAL, NONINVASIVE TREATMENT), EXPERIMENTAL A GROUP (CONVENTIONAL, NONINVASIVE TREATMENT WITH RAJ-YOGA MEDITATION THERAPY AND PRANAYAMA), AND EXPERIMENTAL B GROUP (RAJ-YOGA MEDITATION THERAPY AND PRANAYAMA ONLY). PARAMETERS SUCH AS PAIN, MOUTH OPENING, MANDIBULAR DEVIATION, INFLAMMATION, SWELLING, CLICKING, OCCLUSION, AND PSYCHOLOGIC EVALUATION SUCH AS ANXIETY, STRESS, AND DEPRESSION WERE ASSESSED BEFORE THE START OF THE STUDY AND AT WEEKLY INTERVALS FOR 3 MONTHS. RESULTS: POSTTREATMENT PAIN AND INFLAMMATION IMPROVED BOTH IN THE CONTROL GROUP AND EXPERIMENTAL A GROUP, BUT STATISTICALLY IT IS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT IN THE EXPERIMENTAL A GROUP. FURTHERMORE, IT IS EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY AS WELL AS FOR A LONG PERIOD IN EXPERIMENTAL A GROUP. IMPROVEMENT IN MOUTH OPENING WAS STATISTICALLY HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT IN CONTROL GROUP BUT NOT IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS. POSTTREATMENT ANXIETY AND STRESS STATUS WAS IMPROVED WITH STATISTICALLY HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT RESULT IN THE EXPERIMENTAL A AND B. THE POSTTREATMENT DEPRESSION STATUS ALONG WITH MANDIBULAR DEVIATION, SWELLING, CLICKING, AND OCCLUSION HAS NOT IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY IN ANY OF THE GROUPS. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION: RAJ-YOGA MEDITATION AND PRANAYAMA IN COMBINATION WITH CONVENTIONAL, NONINVASIVE, TREATMENT MODALITIES SHOWED PROMISING RESULTS IN MPDS PATIENTS AS COMPARED TO EITHER MODALITIES ALONE.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
9 1046  30 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION FOR HIGH RISK MOTHERS ON HOSPITAL BEDREST. BACKGROUND: AND PURPOSE: IN RECENT YEARS, YOGA PRACTITIONERS HAVE JOINED FORCES WITH MEDICAL PROGRAMS TO APPROACH PATIENTS' WELL-BEING HOLISTICALLY. THIS STUDY IS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF A SPECIALIZED ADAPTED YOGA PROGRAM ON ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION FOR HIGH-RISK EXPECTANT MOTHERS ON BEDREST IN A HOSPITAL SETTING. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SEVENTY-NINE PREGNANT SUBJECTS ON PHYSICIAN ORDERED HOSPITALIZED BEDREST WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS: RECEIVING BIWEEKLY YOGA SESSIONS (INTERVENTION GROUP) OR RECEIVING NO YOGA (CONTROL GROUP). DATA COLLECTION TOOL WAS THE HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE (HADS) TO ASSESS OUTCOMES AFTER DELIVERY. RESULTS: YOGA, EVEN AS LITTLE AS THREE SESSIONS, SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN REDUCING ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION HIGH-RISK PREGNANT WOMEN ON HOSPITALIZED BEDREST. PERCEIVED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION OVERALL SCORES WERE LOWER IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP THAN IN THE CONTROL GROUP (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THAT YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION TO DECREASE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION IN HIGH-RISK ANTEPARTUM WOMEN ON HOSPITALIZED BEDREST.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
10  819  25 EFFECT OF YOGA ON DEPRESSION IN HYPOTHYROIDISM: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: THE PREVALENCE OF HYPOTHYROIDISM AMONG INDIAN WOMEN IS 15.8%. DEPRESSION IS FREQUENTLY REPORTED IN HYPOTHYROIDISM. YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR DEPRESSION. HOWEVER, THE INFLUENCE OF YOGA ON DEPRESSION IN PATIENTS WITH HYPOTHYROIDISM HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED. AIM: THE PRESENT STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECT OF A 3-MONTH INTEGRATED YOGA INTERVENTION (3-IY) ON DEPRESSION, LIPID INDICES, AND SERUM THYROID-STIMULATING HORMONE (STSH) LEVELS AMONG FEMALE PATIENTS HAVING HYPOTHYROIDISM, AND MILD-TO-MODERATE DEPRESSION. METHOD: THE PRESENT SINGLE-ARM PRE-POST DESIGN STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN THIRTY-EIGHT WOMEN (AVERAGE AGE 34.2 +/- 4.7 YEARS). PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED A 3-IY COMPRISING ASANAS, PRANAYAMA, AND RELAXATION TECHNIQUES FOR 60 MIN DAILY (5 DAYS A WEEK). DEPRESSION, STSH, LIPID PROFILE INDICES, BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), FATIGUE, ANXIETY, AND STRESS WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND AFTER 12 WEEKS. THYROID MEDICATION WAS KEPT CONSTANT DURING THE STUDY PERIOD. DATA WERE ANALYSED USING R STUDIO SOFTWARE. RESULT: A SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.05) REDUCTION IN DEPRESSION (58%), STSH (37%), BMI (6%), FATIGUE (64%), ANXIETY (57%), LIPID PROFILE INDICES (HLD INCREASED SIGNIFICANTY), AND STRESS (55%) LEVELS WAS OBSERVED AFTER 3 MONTHS, COMPARED WITH THE CORRESPONDING BASELINE LEVELS. CONCLUSION: THE 3-IY IS USEFUL FOR REDUCING DEPRESSION, DYSLIPIDEMIA, AND STSH IN WOMEN WITH HYPOTHYROIDISM AND DEPRESSION. FURTHER STUDIES WITH A LARGER SAMPLE SIZE AND A ROBUST RESEARCH DESIGN USING OBJECTIVE VARIABLES MUST BE CONDUCTED TO STRENGTHEN THE STUDY FINDINGS.	2021

12  755  30 EFFECT OF SHORT-TERM YOGA-BASED-BREATHING ON PERI-OPERATIVE ANXIETY IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING CARDIAC SURGERY. BACKGROUND: PERI-OPERATIVE ANXIETY IN PATIENTS SCHEDULED FOR CARDIAC SURGERY IS DETRIMENTAL. THIS STUDY EVALUATED THE EFFECT OF SHORT-TERM YOGA BASED-BREATHING WITH DIFFERENT VARIATIONS ON PERI-OPERATIVE ANXIETY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN PATIENTS AGED 20-60 YEARS SCHEDULED FOR MAJOR CARDIAC SURGERY. PATIENTS IN YOGA GROUP WERE TRAINED FOR YOGA BASED-BREATHING WITH DIFFERENT VARIATIONS FOR 5 DAYS; NO INTERVENTION WAS DONE IN CONTROLS. RESULTS: WE ANALYZED TWENTY PATIENTS IN EACH GROUP. ANXIETY SCORES MEASURED AT BASELINE, PRESURGERY, AND POSTSURGERY WERE ENTERED AS THE WITHIN-SUBJECTS FACTOR; GROUP STATUS WAS ENTERED AS THE BETWEEN-SUBJECTS FACTOR IN THE RMANOVA. BASELINE DEMOGRAPHICS AND ANXIETY SCORES WERE COMPARABLE. THE SHORT-TERM YOGA-BASED BREATHING EXERCISE-TRAINING PROGRAM HAD A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON STATE (F = 13.45, P < 0.0001), TRAIT (F = 13.29, P < 0.0001) AND TOTAL ANXIETY SCORES (F = 29.44, P < 0.0001) AT DIFFERENT TIME POINTS FOR YOGA OVER CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: SHORT-TERM YOGA-BASED BREATHING FOR 5 DAYS LOWERS PRESURGERY AND POSTSURGERY ANXIETY IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING CARDIAC SURGERY.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
13 1852  28 RANDOMISED CLINICAL TRIAL: YOGA VS A LOW-FODMAP DIET IN PATIENTS WITH IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME. BACKGROUND: IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME IS THE MOST FREQUENT GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDER. IT IS ASSUMED THAT LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS MIGHT BE A RATIONAL TREATMENT APPROACH. AIM: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF A YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION VS A LOW-FODMAP DIET ON PATIENTS WITH IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME. METHODS: FIFTY-NINE PATIENTS WITH IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME UNDERTOOK A SINGLE-BLIND, RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL INVOLVING YOGA OR A LOW-FODMAP DIET FOR 12 WEEKS. PATIENTS IN THE YOGA GROUP RECEIVED TWO SESSIONS WEEKLY, WHILE PATIENTS IN THE LOW-FODMAP GROUP RECEIVED A TOTAL OF THREE SESSIONS OF NUTRITIONAL COUNSELLING. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS A CHANGE IN GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS (IBS-SSS). SECONDARY OUTCOMES EXPLORED CHANGES IN QUALITY OF LIFE (IBS-QOL), HEALTH (SF-36), PERCEIVED STRESS (CPSS, PSQ), BODY AWARENESS (BAQ), BODY RESPONSIVENESS (BRS) AND SAFETY OF THE INTERVENTIONS. OUTCOMES WERE EXAMINED IN WEEKS 12 AND 24 BY ASSESSORS "BLINDED" TO PATIENTS' GROUP ALLOCATION. RESULTS: NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND BETWEEN THE INTERVENTION GROUPS, WITH REGARD TO IBS-SSS SCORE, AT EITHER 12 (DELTA = 31.80; 95%CI = -11.90, 75.50; P = .151) OR 24 WEEKS (DELTA = 33.41; 95%CI = -4.21, 71.04; P = .081). WITHIN-GROUP COMPARISONS SHOWED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS FOR YOGA AND LOW-FODMAP DIET AT BOTH 12 AND 24 WEEKS (ALL P < .001). COMPARABLE WITHIN-GROUP EFFECTS OCCURRED FOR THE OTHER OUTCOMES. ONE PATIENT IN EACH INTERVENTION GROUP EXPERIENCED SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (P = 1.00) AND ANOTHER, ALSO IN EACH GROUP, EXPERIENCED NONSERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS (P = 1.00). CONCLUSIONS: PATIENTS WITH IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME MIGHT BENEFIT FROM YOGA AND A LOW-FODMAP DIET, AS BOTH GROUPS SHOWED A REDUCTION IN GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS. MORE RESEARCH ON THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS OF BOTH INTERVENTIONS IS WARRANTED, AS WELL AS EXPLORATION OF POTENTIAL BENEFITS FROM THEIR COMBINED USE.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
14  284  38 ADIPONECTIN, INTERLEUKIN-6, AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK FACTORS ARE MODIFIED BY A SHORT-TERM YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION IN OVERWEIGHT AND OBESE MEN. OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF A SHORT-TERM YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION ON RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (CVD) AND MARKERS OF INFLAMMATION AND ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION IN OVERWEIGHT AND OBESE MEN. DESIGN: NONRANDOMIZED PROSPECTIVE LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION STUDY WITH PRE-POST DESIGN. SETTING AND LOCATION: INTEGRAL HEALTH CLINIC, AN OUTPATIENT FACILITY PROVIDING YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION PROGRAMS FOR PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC DISEASES. SUBJECTS: OVERWEIGHT AND OBESE MEN (N=51) WERE ENROLLED IN THE STUDY. SUBJECTS WHO WERE PHYSICALLY UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE AND THOSE PARTICIPATING IN OTHER INTERVENTIONS WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE STUDY. INTERVENTION: A PRETESTED INTERVENTION PROGRAM INCLUDING ASANAS (PHYSICAL POSTURES), PRANAYAMA (BREATHING EXERCISES), GROUP DISCUSSIONS, LECTURES, AND INDIVIDUALIZED ADVICE. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS WEIGHT LOSS, AND THE SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES WERE CLINICAL AND LABORATORY CORRELATES OF CVD RISK, LEVELS OF INTERLEUKIN-6 (IL-6), ADIPONECTIN, AND ENDOTHELIN-1 (ET-1). RESULTS: MEN (N=51, BODY MASS INDEX [BMI] 26.26+/-2.42 KG/M(2)) WERE ENROLLED AND UNDERWENT A YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION FOR 10 DAYS. OF 51 SUBJECTS, 30 COMPLETED THE STUDY. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN WEIGHT FROM BASELINE TO DAY 10 (74.60+/-7.98, 72.69+/-8.37 KG, P<0.001, RESPECTIVELY), BMI (26.26+/-2.42, 25.69+/-2.47 KG/M(2), P<0.001, RESPECTIVELY), AND SYSTOLIC BP (121.73+/-11.58, 116.73+/-9.00, P=0.042, RESPECTIVELY). THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PLASMA IL-6 FROM BASELINE TO DAY 10 (MEDIAN 2.24 VS. 1.26 PG/ML, RESPECTIVELY, P=0.012). THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE PLASMA ADIPONECTIN FROM BASELINE TO DAY 10 (MEDIAN 4.95 VS. 6.26 MUG/ML, RESPECTIVELY, P=0.014). PLASMA ET-1 LEVEL REMAINED UNCHANGED. CONCLUSION: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT EVEN A SHORT-TERM YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION MAY BE AN IMPORTANT MODALITY TO REDUCE THE RISK FOR CVD AS INDICATED BY WEIGHT LOSS, REDUCTION IN SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE, AN INCREASE IN ADIPONECTIN, AND DECREASE IN IL-6 IN OVERWEIGHT AND OBESE MEN.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
15 2319  28 TREATING THE CLIMACTERIC SYMPTOMS IN INDIAN WOMEN WITH AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO YOGA THERAPY: A RANDOMIZED CONTROL STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE CLIMACTERIC SYMPTOMS, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND PERSONALITY IN PERIMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. DESIGN: ONE HUNDRED TWENTY PARTICIPANTS (AGES 40-55 Y) WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO STUDY ARMS, IE, YOGA AND CONTROL. THE YOGA GROUP PRACTICED AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO YOGA THERAPY COMPRISING SURYA NAMASKARA (SUN SALUTATION) WITH 12 POSTURES, PRANAYAMA (BREATHING PRACTICES), AND AVARTAN DHYAN (CYCLIC MEDITATION), WHEREAS THE CONTROL GROUP PRACTICED A SET OF SIMPLE PHYSICAL EXERCISES UNDER SUPERVISION OF TRAINED TEACHERS FOR 8 WEEKS (1 H DAILY, 5 DAYS PER WEEK). THE ASSESSMENTS WERE MADE BY GREENE CLIMACTERIC SCALE, PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE, AND EYSENCK'S PERSONALITY INVENTORY BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION. RESULTS: OF THE THREE FACTORS OF THE GREENE CLIMACTERIC SCALE, THE MANN-WHITNEY TEST SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS (P < 0.05) IN THE VASOMOTOR SYMPTOMS, A MARGINALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE (P = 0.06) IN PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS BUT NOT IN THE SOMATIC COMPONENT. EFFECT SIZES WERE HIGHER IN THE YOGA GROUP FOR ALL FACTORS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER DEGREE OF DECREASE IN PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE SCORES (P < 0.001, INDEPENDENT SAMPLES T TEST) IN THE YOGA GROUP COMPARED WITH CONTROLS (BETWEEN-GROUP ANALYSIS) WITH A HIGHER EFFECT SIZE IN THE YOGA GROUP (1.10) THAN THE CONTROL (0.27). ON THE EYSENCK'S PERSONALITY INVENTORY, THE DECREASE IN NEUROTICISM WAS GREATER (P < 0.05) IN THE YOGA GROUP (EFFECT SIZE = 0.43) THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (EFFECT SIZE = 0.21) WITH NO CHANGE IN EXTROVERSION IN EITHER THE YOGA OR CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: EIGHT WEEKS OF AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO YOGA THERAPY DECREASES CLIMACTERIC SYMPTOMS, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND NEUROTICISM IN PERIMENOPAUSAL WOMEN BETTER THAN PHYSICAL EXERCISE.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
16   97  21 A NONRANDOMIZED COMPARISON STUDY OF SELF-HYPNOSIS, YOGA, AND COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY TO REDUCE EMOTIONAL DISTRESS IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. THE AUTHORS ASKED BREAST CANCER (BC) PATIENTS TO PARTICIPATE IN 1 OF 3 MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS (COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT), YOGA, OR SELF-HYPNOSIS) TO EXPLORE THEIR FEASIBILITY, EASE OF COMPLIANCE, AND IMPACT ON THE PARTICIPANTS' DISTRESS, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), SLEEP, AND MENTAL ADJUSTMENT. NINETY-NINE PATIENTS COMPLETED AN INTERVENTION (CBT: N = 10; YOGA: N = 21; AND SELF-HYPNOSIS: N = 68). RESULTS SHOWED HIGH FEASIBILITY AND HIGH COMPLIANCE. AFTER THE INTERVENTIONS, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT IN THE CBT GROUP BUT SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECTS ON DISTRESS IN THE YOGA AND SELF-HYPNOSIS GROUPS, AND, ALSO, ON QOL, SLEEP, AND MENTAL ADJUSTMENT IN THE SELF-HYPNOSIS GROUP. IN CONCLUSION, MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS CAN DECREASE DISTRESS IN BC PATIENTS, BUT RCTS ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE FINDINGS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
17  843  30 EFFECT OF YOGA ON PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONING OF NURSING STUDENTS: A RANDOMIZED WAIT LIST CONTROL TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: NURSING STUDENTS EXPERIENCE CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF STRESS TO MEET THEIR PROFESSIONAL DEMANDS. YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE PRACTICE TO REDUCE STRESS AND IMPROVE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL BEING. HOWEVER, IMPROVEMENT IN PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL BEING AIDS IN STRESS MANAGEMENT. AIM: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EIGHT WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION ON PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONING OF NURSING STUDENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS WAS A RANDOMISED WAIT LIST CONTROL (WLC) TRIAL, WE RECRUITED TOTAL 100 STUDENTS FROM KEMPEGOWDA INSTITUTE OF NURSING, BENGALURU, KARNATAKA, INDIA AND RANDOMIZED THEM INTO TWO GROUPS (YOGA=50 AND WLC=50 STUDENTS). THE FOLLOWING INSTRUMENTS WERE USED TO COLLECT THE DATA, FREIBURG MINDFULNESS INVENTORY (FMI), SELF-COMPASSION SCALE- SHORT FORM (SCS-SF), CONNOR-DAVIDSON RESILIENCE SCALE (CD-RISC), SATISFACTION WITH LIFE SCALE (SWLS), JEFFERSON SCALE OF EMPATHY HPS-VERSION (JSE-HPS), AND PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE (PSS). DATA WAS ANALYSED USING REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (RM-ANOVA) FOLLOWED BY POST-HOC BONFERRONI CORRECTION FOR ALL PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIABLES. RESULTS: THE RESULTS OF OUR STUDY REPORT THAT EIGHT WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING SELF COMPASSION AND MINDFULNESS AMONG NURSING STUDENTS IN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP THAN COMPARED TO WLC GROUP. EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE IMPROVEMENTS IN RESILIENCE, SATISFACTION IN LIFE AND PERCEIVED STRESS, RESULTS WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. CONCLUSION: OVERALL, RESULTS OF THE PRESENT STUDY HAVE DEMONSTRATED IMPACT OF EIGHT WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONING OF NURSING STUDENTS. YOGA INTERVENTION CAN BE INCULCATED IN THE NURSING EDUCATION TO MEET DEMANDS OF THE PROFESSION.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
18   63  34 A COMPREHENSIVE YOGA PROGRAMS IMPROVES PAIN, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION IN CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN PATIENTS MORE THAN EXERCISE: AN RCT. INTRODUCTION: PREVIOUSLY, OUTPATIENT YOGA PROGRAMS FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) LASTING SEVERAL MONTHS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO REDUCE PAIN, ANALGESIC REQUIREMENT AND DISABILITY, AND IMPROVE SPINAL MOBILITY. THIS STUDY EVALUATED CHANGES IN PAIN, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND SPINAL MOBILITY FOR CLBP PATIENTS ON SHORT-TERM, RESIDENTIAL YOGA AND PHYSICAL EXERCISE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING COMPREHENSIVE YOGA LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS. METHODS: A SEVEN DAY RANDOMIZED CONTROL SINGLE BLIND ACTIVE STUDY IN AN RESIDENTIAL HOLISTIC HEALTH CENTRE IN BANGALORE, INDIA, ASSIGNED 80 PATIENTS (37 FEMALE, 43 MALE) WITH CLBP TO YOGA AND PHYSICAL EXERCISE GROUPS. THE YOGA PROGRAM CONSISTED OF SPECIFIC ASANAS AND PRANAYAMAS FOR BACK PAIN, MEDITATION, YOGIC COUNSELLING, AND LECTURES ON YOGA PHILOSOPHY. THE CONTROL GROUP PROGRAM INCLUDED PHYSICAL THERAPY EXERCISES FOR BACK PAIN, AND MATCHING COUNSELLING AND EDUCATION SESSIONS. RESULTS: GROUPXTIME INTERACTIONS (P<0.05) AND BETWEEN GROUP DIFFERENCES (P<0.05) WERE SIGNIFICANT IN ALL VARIABLES. BOTH GROUPS' SCORES ON THE NUMERICAL RATING SCALE FOR PAIN REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY, 49% IN YOGA (P<0.001, ES=1.62), 17.5% IN CONTROLS (P=0.005, ES=0.67). STATE ANXIETY (STAI) REDUCED 20.4% (P<0.001, ES=0.72) AND TRAIT ANXIETY 16% (P<0.001, ES=1.09) IN THE YOGA GROUP. DEPRESSION (BDI) DECREASED IN BOTH GROUPS, 47% IN YOGA (P<0.001, ES=0.96,) AND 19.9% IN CONTROLS (P<0.001, ES=0.59). SPINAL MOBILITY ('SIT AND REACH' INSTRUMENT) IMPROVED IN BOTH GROUPS, 50%, IN YOGA (P<0.001, ES=2.99) AND 34.6% IN CONTROLS (P<0.001, ES=0.81). CONCLUSION: SEVEN DAYS INTENSIVE RESIDENTIAL YOGA PROGRAM REDUCES PAIN, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION, AND IMPROVES SPINAL MOBILITY IN PATIENTS WITH CLBP MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN PHYSIOTHERAPY EXERCISES.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
19  822  23 EFFECT OF YOGA ON FEV1, 6-MINUTE WALK DISTANCE (6-MWD) AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH COPD GROUP B. INTRODUCTION: YOGA IS USED IN THE TREATMENT OF VARIOUS DISEASES, INCLUDING CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE. HOWEVER, NO STUDIES HAVE ASSESSED THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON COPD PATIENTS IN INDONESIA. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS STUDY AND SIMILAR STUDIES COMPLETED IN OTHER COUNTRIES LIES IN THE TYPE OF YOGA EXERCISES COMPLETED, THE METHOD IN WHICH THEY WERE COMPLETED, AND IN CERTAIN, UNIQUE DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS. THIS STUDY AIMS TO ANALYZE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON FEV1, 6-MINUTE WALK DISTANCE, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH COPD GROUP B IN INDONESIA. MATERIAL AND METHODS: THIS ARTICLE REFLECTS RESEARCH DONE IN THE FORM OF AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY USING ARANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH PRE AND POST-TEST CONTROL GROUP DESIGN. THE SAMPLES WERE DIVIDED INTO 2 GROUPS: THE TREATMENT GROUP (YOGA PRACTICE FOR 1 HOUR, 2 TIMES AWEEK FOR 12 WEEKS) AND THE CONTROL GROUP (UNTREATED WITH YOGA, GIVEN LUNG REHABILITATION BROCHURE). ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECT OF YOGA EXERCISES ON LUNG FUNCTION PARAMETERS (FEV1), 6-MINUTE WALK DISTANCE AND QUALITY OF LIFE WERE USED USING SGRQ QUESTIONNAIRES IN COPD GROUP B. RESULTS: 33 COPD PATIENTS FULFILLED THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. 30 PATIENTS COMPLETED THE STUDY. PRE AND POST YOGA RESULTS WERE EVALU-ATED IN THE TREATMENT GROUP VERSUS THE CONTROL GROUP AND THEN FURTHER ASSESSED USING STATISTICAL TESTS. THERE WAS ASIGNIFICANT IN-CREASE IN FEV1, 6-MWD AND QUALITY OF LIFE USING ASGRQ QUESTIONNAIRE AFTER 12 WEEKS OF YOGA (P < 0.05) AS WELL AS AASIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN FEV1, 6-MWD AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE TREATMENT GROUP (P < 0.05) WHEN COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: YOGA AFFECTS FEV1, 6-MWD, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH GROUP B COPD.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
20 2833  24 YOGA'S EFFECT ON FALLS IN RURAL, OLDER ADULTS. BACKGROUND: UNINTENTIONAL FALLS AFFECT 30% OF PEOPLE OVER AGE 65 YEARS. YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE BALANCE. WE DESIGNED THIS STUDY TO EXAMINE IF YOGA REDUCES FALLS. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED 16 SESSIONS OF HATHA YOGA OVER 8 WEEKS. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO PRACTICE 10MIN OF YOGA DAILY AT HOME IN ADDITION TO 5-MIN RELAXATION EXERCISES OR RELAXATION EXERCISES ONLY (CONTROL GROUP). RESULTS: OF THE 38 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETING THE INTERVENTION, 15 PARTICIPANTS REPORTED A TOTAL OF 27 FALLS IN THE 6-MONTHS BEFORE THE STUDY, COMPARED TO 13 PARTICIPANTS SUSTAINING 14 FALLS IN THE 6 MONTHS FROM THE START OF THE STUDY (P<0.047), WITHOUT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOGA HOME-EXERCISE AND HOME RELAXATION-ONLY GROUPS. COMPARED TO BASELINE SCORES, ALL PARTICIPANTS IMPROVED ON THE BERG BALANCE SCALE (53-54 OUT OF 56, P=0.002), THE FUNCTIONAL GAIT ASSESSMENT (22.9-25.8 OUT OF 30 POINTS, P<0.001), AND THE DYNAMIC GAIT INDEX (20.6-22.4 OUT OF 24 POINTS, P<0.001). RIGHT LEG STAND TIME IMPROVED FROM A MEAN OF 13.3S TO 17.1S (P=0.020) AND STANDING FORWARD REACH DISTANCE FROM 26.0CM TO 29.6CM (P<0.001). WITHOUT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS. CONFIDENCE, WITH THE ACTIVITIES-SPECIFIC BALANCE CONFIDENCE SCALE, INCREASED IN THE YOGA HOME-EXERCISE GROUP (88%-93%, P=0.037) COMPARED TO 90% UNCHANGED FROM PRE-INTERVENTION IN THE HOME RELAXATION-ONLY GROUP. CONCLUSION: YOGA CLASSES REDUCE SELF-REPORTED FALLS AND IMPROVE BALANCE MEASURES. THE ADDITION OF HOME YOGA EXERCISES DID NOT ENHANCE BENEFIT OVER RELAXATION EXERCISE ONLY.	2017

1 1775 72 PRACTICE OF YOGA MAY CAUSE DAMAGE OF BOTH SCIATIC NERVES: A CASE REPORT. SCIATIC NERVE TRAUMATIC DAMAGE VERY RARELY OCCURS BILATERALLY. WE DESCRIBE THE CASE OF A 67-YEAR-OLD WOMAN WHO REPORTED A BILATERAL TRAUMATIC LESION OF THE SCIATIC NERVE DURING PRACTICE OF YOGA. NERVE CONDUCTION STUDIES SHOWED A BILATERAL SCIATIC NERVE NEUROPATHY, MOSTLY AFFECTING THE PERONEAL COMPONENT. LUMBAR PLEXUS MRI DOCUMENTED REGULAR ANATOMICAL FEATURES OF THE MAIN PRINCIPAL NERVE ROOTS WITH BILATERAL T2 SIGNAL ALTERATION OF ROOTS L4, L5 AND S1 THAT EXTENDED INTO THE SCIATIC NERVES SHOWING BOTH INCREASE IN SIZE, PROBABLY RELATED TO CHRONIC INJURY OF NERVES, AND AN ALTERATION IN DIFFUSION SIGNAL THAT SUGGESTED A RECENT ACUTE OVERLAPPED PROCESS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
2 2893 15 YOGAMAN: AN INEXPENSIVE, ANATOMICALLY-DETAILED CHEST TUBE PLACEMENT TRAINER. INTRODUCTION: OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHEST TUBE PLACEMENT IN EMERGENCY MEDICINE TRAINING PROGRAMS HAVE DECREASED, MAKING COMPETENCE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE WITH LIVE PATIENTS PROBLEMATIC. AVAILABLE TRAINERS ARE EXPENSIVE AND MAY REQUIRE COSTLY MAINTENANCE. METHODS: WE CONSTRUCTED AN ANATOMICALLY-DETAILED MODEL USING A HALLOWEEN SKELETON THORAX, DRESS FORM TORSO, AND YOGA MAT. PARTICIPANTS IN A TRIAL SESSION COMPLETED A SURVEY REGARDING EITHER THEIR COMFORT WITH CHEST TUBE PLACEMENT BEFORE AND AFTER THE SESSION OR THE REALISM OF YOGAMAN VS. CADAVER LAB, DEPENDING ON WHETHER THEY HAD PLACED <10 OR 10 OR MORE CHEST TUBES IN LIVE PATIENTS. RESULTS: INEXPERIENCED PROVIDERS REPORTED AN IMPROVEMENT IN COMFORT AFTER WORKING WITH YOGAMAN, (COMFORT BEFORE 47 MILLIMETERS [MM] [INTERQUARTILE RATIO {IQR}, 20-53 MM]; COMFORT AFTER 75 MM [IQR, 39-80 MM], P=0.01). EXPERIENCED PROVIDERS RATED REALISM OF YOGAMAN AND CADAVER LAB SIMILARLY (YOGAMAN 79 MM [IQR, 74-83 MM]; CADAVER LAB 78 MM [IQR, 76-89 MM], P=0.67). ALL EVALUATORS EITHER AGREED OR STRONGLY AGREED THAT YOGAMAN WAS USEFUL FOR TEACHING CHEST TUBE PLACEMENT IN A RESIDENCY PROGRAM. CONCLUSION: OUR CHEST TUBE TRAINER ALLOWED FOR LANDMARK IDENTIFICATION, TISSUE DISSECTION, PLEURA PUNCTURE, LUNG PALPATION, AND TUBE SECURING. IT IMPROVED COMFORT OF INEXPERIENCED PROVIDERS AND WAS RATED SIMILARLY TO CADAVER LAB IN REALISM BY EXPERIENCED PROVIDERS. IT IS EASILY REUSABLE AND, AT $198, COSTS A FRACTION OF THE PRICE OF AVAILABLE COMMERCIAL TRAINERS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
3 2766 15 YOGA PROTOCOL FOR TREATMENT OF BREAST CANCER-RELATED LYMPHEDEMA. INTRODUCTION: VAQAS AND RYAN (2003) ADVOCATED YOGA AND BREATHING EXERCISES FOR LYMPHEDEMA. NARAHARI ET AL. (2007) DEVELOPED AN INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE PROTOCOL FOR LOWER-LIMB LYMPHEDEMA USING YOGA. STUDIES HAVE HYPOTHESIZED THAT YOGA PLAYS A SIMILAR ROLE AS THAT OF CENTRAL MANUAL LYMPH DRAINAGE OF FOLDI'S TECHNIQUE. THIS STUDY EXPLAINS HOW WE HAVE USED YOGA AND BREATHING AS A SELF-CARE INTERVENTION FOR BREAST CANCER-RELATED LYMPHEDEMA (BCRL). METHODS: THE STUDY OUTCOME WAS TO CREATE A YOGA PROTOCOL FOR BCRL. SELECTION OF YOGA WAS BASED ON THE ACTIONS OF MUSCLES ON JOINTS, ANATOMICAL AREAS ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT GROUPS OF LYMPH NODES, STRETCHING OF SKIN, AND METHOD OF BREATHING IN EACH YOGA. THE PROTOCOL WAS PILOTED IN EIGHT BCRL PATIENTS, OBSERVED ITS DIFFICULTIES BY INTERACTING WITH PATIENTS. A LITERATURE SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED IN PUBMED AND COCHRANE LIBRARY TO IDENTIFY THE YOGA PROTOCOLS FOR BCRL. RESULTS: TWENTY YOGA AND 5 BREATHING EXERCISES WERE ADOPTED. THEY HAVE SLOW, METHODICAL JOINT MOVEMENTS WHICH HELPED PATIENTS TO TOLERATE PAIN. BREATHING WAS LONG AND DIAPHRAGMATIC. FLEXION OF JOINTS WAS COORDINATED WITH EXHALATION AND EXTENSION WITH INHALATION. ALTERNATE YOGA WAS INTRODUCED TO FACILITATE PATIENTS TO PERFORM COMPLEX MOVEMENTS. YOGA'S JOINT MOVEMENTS, INITIAL POSITIONS, AND MODE OF BREATHING WERE COMPARED TO TWO OTHER PROTOCOLS. THE VOLUME REDUCED FROM 2.4 TO 1.2 L IN EIGHT PATIENTS AFTER CONTINUOUS PRACTICE OF YOGA AND COMPRESSION AT HOME FOR 3 MONTHS. THERE WAS IMPROVEMENT IN THE RANGE OF MOVEMENT AND INTENSITY OF PAIN. DISCUSSION: YOGA EXERCISES WERE SELECTED ON THE BASIS OF THEIR ROLE IN CHEST EXPANSION, MAXIMIZING RANGE OF MOVEMENTS: FLEXION OF LARGE MUSCLES, MAXIMUM STRETCH OF SKIN, AND THUS PART-BY-PART LYMPH DRAINAGE FROM CENTER AND PERIPHERY. THIS PROTOCOL ADDRESSED FUNCTIONAL, VOLUME, AND MOVEMENT ISSUES OF BCRL AND WAS FOUND TO BE SUPERIOR TO OTHER BCRL YOGA PROTOCOLS. HOWEVER, THIS PROTOCOL NEEDS TO BE TESTED IN CENTERS ROUTINELY MANAGING BCRL.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
4 2505 10 YOGA ASANAS AS AN EFFECTIVE FORM OF EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING WHEN TEACHING MUSCULOSKELETAL ANATOMY OF THE LOWER LIMB. PHYSICAL MOVEMENT AS A CONDUIT FOR EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING WITHIN THE ACADEMIC CONTEXT OF ANATOMY IS A STRATEGY CURRENTLY USED IN UNIVERSITY DANCE EDUCATION. THIS SAME APPROACH CAN BE APPLIED TO OTHER MOVEMENT-BASED PRACTICES, FOR EXAMPLE, YOGA. THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO PILOT A NOVEL TEACHING CURRICULUM TO YOGA PRACTITIONERS, BASED ON BRUNER'S THEORY OF INSTRUCTION, WHICH INCORPORATED THE FOUR ADAPTIVE MODES OF KOLB'S THEORY OF EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING. THE SECONDARY PURPOSE WAS TO ASSESS THE APPLICABILITY OF ANATOMICAL KNOWLEDGE WITHIN THE PARTICIPANTS' YOGA PRACTICE. FOLLOWING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CURRICULUM APPROPRIATE FOR A SPECTRUM OF ACADEMIC BACKGROUNDS, PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED TO ATTEND A 2-HOUR LEARNING SESSION WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF ANATOMY AT QUEEN'S UNIVERSITY IN KINGSTON, ONTARIO, CANADA. THE LEARNING SESSION GUIDED PARTICIPANTS THROUGH THE BONES AND MUSCLES OF THE LOWER LIMB PERTAINING TO FIVE SPECIFIC YOGA POSES. BASED ON PARTICIPANT FEEDBACK, THE SESSIONS WERE POSITIVELY RECEIVED AND CONSISTENT. IN ADDITION, LEARNING SESSION PARTICIPANTS WERE ABLE TO APPLY THE ANATOMICAL INFORMATION THEY WERE TAUGHT TO THEIR YOGA PRACTICE 1-MONTH LATER. BRUNER AND KOLB'S INDEPENDENT THEORIES ON CURRICULUM DESIGN AND EFFECTIVE LEARNING PRACTICE WERE SUCCESSFULLY INCORPORATED TO CREATE A 2-HOUR LEARNING SESSION. THE POTENTIAL USE OF EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING TO COMPLIMENT AND/OR ENHANCE TRADITIONAL DIDACTIC TEACHING IN THE ACADEMIC CONTEXT OF ANATOMY SHOULD BE FURTHER EXPLORED.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
5 2399 19 YOGA AND CUTANEOUS FUNCTIONAL UNIT RECRUITMENT FOR A PATIENT WITH CERVICAL AND UPPER EXTREMITY BURN SCAR CONTRACTURE: CASE REPORT. BURN SCAR CONTRACTURE GREATLY LIMITS FUNCTION FOR BURN SURVIVORS, PARTICULARLY WHEN THE SCARRING CROSSES MULTIPLE JOINTS. PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS IDENTIFIED FIELDS OF SKIN RECRUITED DURING SINGLE JOINT MOTION, CALLED CUTANEOUS FUNCTIONAL UNITS (CFU), INDICATING THAT IMPAIRMENTS MAY BE SEEN DISTAL TO THE INJURED TISSUE. THIS CASE REPORT CONNECTS THE PRINCIPLES OF CFU AND YOGA-INSPIRED THERAPY MODALITIES IN IMPROVING CLINICAL OUTCOMES FOR A BURN SURVIVOR. THE PATIENT IS A 38-YEAR-OLD MALE WHO SUSTAINED DEEP PARTIAL-THICKNESS ELECTRICAL BURNS TO HIS NECK, CHEST, AND BILATERAL UPPER EXTREMITIES, PRESENTING WITH SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED RANGE OF MOTION. THE PATIENT ATTENDED PHYSICAL THERAPY 4 DAYS A WEEK, WHERE HE PERFORMED A SPECIFIC YOGA ASANA PROGRAM DURING EACH SESSION. OUTCOMES INCLUDING STANDARD RANGE OF MOTION MEASURES, THE VANCOUVER SCAR SCALE (VSS), AND THE NECK DISABILITY INDEX (NDI), WHICH WERE RECORDED EVERY 10 SESSIONS. CFUS OF CERVICAL EXTENSION AND SHOULDER FLEXION WERE ANALYZED VIA PHOTOGRAPHS COMPARING CUTANEOUS POSITION DURING SPECIFIED YOGA POSES AND RESTING ANATOMICAL POSITION IN STANDING. OVER 30 VISITS, CERVICAL AND SHOULDER RANGE OF MOTION INCREASED, ALTHOUGH THE VSS AND NDI DID NOT SHOW SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. YOGA POSES SHOWED OVERALL CUTANEOUS RECRUITMENT DISTAL TO THE TARGETED JOINTS, AND BURNED SKIN WAS RECRUITED SIMILARLY TO NONBURNED SKIN IN POSITIONS OF STRETCH. INCORPORATING MULTIJOINT APPROACHES FOR STRETCHING, LIKE YOGA, APPEARS TO CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVED CLINICAL RANGE-OF-MOTION OUTCOMES WHEN PAIRED WITH TRADITIONAL BURN-REHABILITATION INTERVENTIONS. YOGA POSES INVOLVING MULTIPLE JOINTS ALIGN WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF CFUS, WARRANTING CONTINUED INVESTIGATION.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
6 2474 19 YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT ACTIVITY FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS LEARNING ANATOMY. BACKGROUND: MEDICAL STUDENTS EXPERIENCE HIGH LEVELS OF STRESS DURING TRAINING DUE TO DEMANDING COURSE LOADS WHICH OFTEN LEAVES LESS TIME FOR SELF-CARE. THIS STUDY COMBINES THE SELF-CARE TECHNIQUE OF YOGA WITH LEARNING ANATOMICAL LOCATIONS, INNERVATIONS, ACTIONS, AND FUNCTIONS OF THE MUSCLES AND ORGANS TO DETERMINE IF ANATOMY TESTS SCORES ARE IMPROVED AND WHETHER STUDENTS' STRESS LEVELS ATTENUATE FROM PARTICIPATING IN YOGA. METHODS: IN THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY, 64 STUDENT VOLUNTEERS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO EITHER A YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP OR WAIT LIST CONTROL GROUP THROUGHOUT THE M1 ANATOMY COURSE. THE YOGA GROUP (N = 32) PARTICIPATED IN 8 YOGA SESSIONS SYNCED WITH THE ANATOMY TOPICS THEY WERE LEARNING IN LECTURE. THE WAIT LIST GROUP (N = 32) WENT THROUGH THEIR NORMAL ANATOMY CURRICULUM BUT HAD AN OPTION TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SAME YOGA SESSIONS AFTER THE ANATOMY COURSE. THE PRIMARY RESEARCH PURPOSE WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOGA IMPROVED ANATOMY EXAM PERFORMANCE BY COMPARING FOUR ANATOMY EXAM SCORES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. THE SECONDARY RESEARCH PURPOSES INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING: TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOGA CLASSES INCLUDING ANATOMY TEACHING STILL CONFERRED ACUTE AND LONG-LASTING STRESS RELIEF BY, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARING A STUDENTS' OWN PRE- AND POST-YOGA STRESS LEVEL AND SELF-PERCEIVED STRESS LEVELS BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS; AND TO DETERMINE IF A STUDENT'S CONFIDENCE IN ANATOMY WAS IMPROVED AFTER A YOGA SESSION. RESULTS: THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN ANATOMY EXAM PERFORMANCE BETWEEN STUDENTS WHO RECEIVED YOGA AND THOSE ON THE WAITLIST (ALL P > 0.05). FOR STUDENTS WHO RECEIVED YOGA, THEIR AVERAGE SELF-REPORTED STRESS LEVELS DECREASED AFTER EACH YOGA SESSION, THEIR AVERAGE DASS (DEPRESSION, ANXIETY AND STRESS SCALE) SCORE DECREASED AFTER A YOGA SESSION, BUT THEY WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY LESS STRESSED THAN THEIR WAITLIST PEERS PRIOR TO AN EXAM, AND THEIR SELF-REPORTED CONFIDENCE IN ANATOMY MATERIAL RELATED TO THE BACK, UPPER EXTREMITY, HEAD AND NECK, AND ABDOMEN/PELVIS INCREASED. CONCLUSION: WITH THIS SAMPLE, THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT YOGA SESSIONS PAIRED WITH ANATOMY LECTURE MATERIAL IMPROVED OVERALL ANATOMY EXAM PERFORMANCE, AS OPPOSED TO ONLY THE MUSCULOSKELETAL PORTION WHICH OTHER STUDIES HAVE LOOKED AT. HOWEVER, YOGA ACUTELY REDUCED STRESS LEVELS, AND SUBJECTIVE FEELINGS OF KNOWLEDGE IMPROVEMENT WERE NOTED BY PARTICIPANTS. BOTH OF THESE CAN PROVIDE BENEFITS TO MEDICAL STUDENTS.	2022	

7  443 21 CERVICAL ARTERIAL DISSECTION AND TRAUMATIC MYELOPATHY FOLLOWING YOGA: SURGICAL CASE REPORT. INTRODUCTION: CERVICAL SPONDYLOSIS CAN PREDISPOSE PATIENTS TO CENTRAL CANAL STENOSIS. IN THIS SETTING, MYELOPATHY THROUGH FURTHER FLATTENING OF THE CORD FROM EXTRINSIC COMPRESSION CAN BE PRECIPITATED BY RELATIVELY MINOR TRAUMAS. ARTERIAL DISSECTION IS SIMILARLY CONSIDERED A RESULT OF HIGH VELOCITY OR MOMENTUM DURING TRAUMA, COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH FRACTURES, CERVICAL HYPERFLEXION, OR DIRECT BLUNT FORCE TO THE NECK. OVERALL, PRECAUTIONS FOR BOTH ARTERIAL DISSECTION AND MYELOPATHY ARE RARELY CONSIDERED IN LOW-VELOCITY, STATIC ACTIVITIES SUCH AS YOGA. CASE PRESENTATION: THE AUTHORS REPORT THE CASE OF A 63-YEAR-OLD MAN WHO SUFFERED CONCURRENT CERVICAL MYELOPATHY FROM MULTILEVEL SPONDYLOPATHY, RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY DISSECTION, AND LEFT CERVICAL CAROTID ARTERY DISSECTION FOLLOWING A YOGA SESSION. SYMPTOMATOLOGY CONSISTED OF ACUTE ONSET NECK PAIN, UPPER EXTREMITY SENSORY PARESTHESIA, WORSENING GAIT AND BALANCE, AND IMPAIRED DEXTERITY FOR SEVERAL WEEKS. CERVICAL MRI WAS OBTAINED GIVEN MYELOPATHIC SYMPTOMS AND REVEALED SPONDYLOSIS WITH COMPRESSION AND T2 SIGNAL CHANGE AT C3-C4. CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE NECK REVEALED AFOREMENTIONED DISSECTIONS WITHOUT FLOW LIMITING STENOSIS OR OCCLUSION. A THERAPEUTIC HEPARIN INFUSION WAS STARTED PREOPERATIVELY UNTIL THE PATIENT UNDERWENT C3-C4 ANTERIOR CERVICAL DISCECTOMY AND FUSION. ASPIRIN AND PLAVIX WERE THEN STARTED WITHOUT INCIDENCE AND THE PATIENT HAD SIGNIFICANT BUT GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT IN MYELOPATHIC SYMPTOMS AT 6-WEEK FOLLOW-UP. DISCUSSION: THE STATIC YET INTENSIVE POSES ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA PRESENT A RARE ETIOLOGY FOR ARTERIAL DISSECTION AND MYELOPATHY, BUT PATIENTS WITH PERSISTENT AND PROGRESSIVE SYMPTOMS SHOULD BE SCREENED WITH THE APPROPRIATE IMAGING MODALITY. CERVICAL DECOMPRESSION SHOULD BE EXPEDITED BEFORE INITIATING AN ANTIPLATELET MEDICATION.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
8  401  8 BEYOND THE TRADITIONAL APPROACH TO TEACHING ANATOMY FOR YOGA. CONTEXT: THE TRADITIONAL APPROACH TO TEACHING ANATOMY FOR YOGA, WHILE SYSTEMATIC, IS OFTEN INEFFECTIVE. METHODS: A UNIQUE APPROACH TO TEACHING ANATOMY FOR A YOGA TEACHER TRAINING SEMINAR IS PRESENTED, FOUNDED ON THE PRINCIPLES OF THOMAS MYERS' ANATOMY TRAINS. LAB ACTIVITIES ARE DETAILED AND BLOOM'S TAXONOMY IS APPLIED TO ENSURE STUDENTS ARE ENGAGED IN HIGHER LEVEL THINKING AND APPLICATION. CONCLUSION: GOING BEYOND THE TRADITIONAL APPROACH TO TEACHING ANATOMY FOR YOGA CAN BE EXTREMELY REWARDING FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ALIKE.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
9 1554 13 LIVING ANATOME: TEACHING AND LEARNING MUSCULOSKELETAL ANATOMY THROUGH YOGA AND PILATES. LIVING ANATOME, A PROGRAM DESIGNED IN 2004 BY TWO MEDICAL STUDENTS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DIRECTOR OF ANATOMY, TEACHES MUSCULOSKELETAL ANATOMY THROUGH YOGA AND PILATES. PREVIOUSLY OFFERED AS AN ADJUNCT TO THE GROSS ANATOMY COURSE IN 2007, LIVING ANATOME BECAME AN OFFICIAL PART OF THE CURRICULUM. PREVIOUS RESEARCH CONDUCTED ON THE PROGRAM DEMONSTRATED ITS EFFICACY IN PROVIDING RELAXATION AND WELL-BEING TO STUDENTS WHO ATTENDED. IN 2007, WITH ALL 144 GROSS ANATOMY STUDENTS REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN A 1.5 HOUR LIVING ANATOME SESSION ON THE UPPER AND LOWER LIMBS, THE IMPACT OF THE PROGRAM ON STUDENTS' COMPREHENSION OF MUSCULOSKELETAL ANATOMY WAS ANALYZED THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATION OF 25-QUESTION PRE- AND POST-TESTS, GAUGING KNOWLEDGE IN THE FOLLOWING DOMAINS: UPPER LIMB, LOWER LIMB, MUSCLE FUNCTION, PALPATION, ATTACHMENT/LOCATION, CLINICAL CORRELATE, AND CONTROL (I.E., MATERIAL NOT EMPHASIZED DURING THE INTERVENTION). ANALYSIS OF POSTINTERVENTION TESTS REVEALED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN TOTAL LIVING ANATOME SCORES AS WELL AS IN THE DOMAINS OF UPPER LIMB, MUSCLE FUNCTION, AND PALPATION, INDICATING THE POSSIBLE EFFICACY OF LIVING ANATOME IN TEACHING ANATOMY. PERFORMANCE ON CONTROL QUESTIONS ALSO IMPROVED, ALTHOUGH NOT SIGNIFICANTLY, WHICH MAY INDICATE THE ROLE OF OTHER VARIABLES (E.G., ADDITIONAL STUDY TIME) IN INCREASED PERFORMANCE.	2010

11   64 14 A COMPUTER VISION-BASED YOGA POSE GRADING APPROACH USING CONTRASTIVE SKELETON FEATURE REPRESENTATIONS. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF YOGA POSE GRADING IS TO ASSESS THE INPUT YOGA POSE AND COMPARE IT TO A STANDARD POSE IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION AS A GRADE. IN THIS PAPER, A COMPUTER VISION-BASED YOGA POSE GRADING APPROACH IS PROPOSED USING CONTRASTIVE SKELETON FEATURE REPRESENTATIONS. FIRST, THE PROPOSED APPROACH EXTRACTS HUMAN BODY SKELETON KEYPOINTS FROM THE INPUT YOGA POSE IMAGE AND THEN FEEDS THEIR COORDINATES INTO A POSE FEATURE ENCODER, WHICH IS TRAINED USING CONTRASTIVE TRIPLET EXAMPLES; FINALLY, A COMPARISON OF SIMILAR ENCODED POSE FEATURES IS MADE. FURTHERMORE, TO TACKLE THE INHERENT CHALLENGE OF COMPOSING CONTRASTIVE EXAMPLES IN POSE FEATURE ENCODING, THIS PAPER PROPOSES A NEW STRATEGY TO USE BOTH A COARSE TRIPLET EXAMPLE-COMPRISED OF AN ANCHOR, A POSITIVE EXAMPLE FROM THE SAME CATEGORY, AND A NEGATIVE EXAMPLE FROM A DIFFERENT CATEGORY, AND A FINE TRIPLET EXAMPLE-COMPRISED OF AN ANCHOR, A POSITIVE EXAMPLE, AND A NEGATIVE EXAMPLE FROM THE SAME CATEGORY WITH DIFFERENT POSE QUALITIES. EXTENSIVE EXPERIMENTS ARE CONDUCTED USING TWO BENCHMARK DATASETS TO DEMONSTRATE THE SUPERIOR PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED APPROACH.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
12   81 11 A MATHEMATICAL MODEL OF EFFECTS ON SPECIFIC JOINTS DURING PRACTICE OF THE SUN SALUTATION--A SEQUENCE OF YOGA POSTURES. THE 'SUN SALUTATION' CONSISTS OF A SEQUENCE OF TEN YOGA POSTURES, EACH POSTURE COUNTERACTING THE PRECEDING ONE PRODUCING A BALANCE BETWEEN FLEXION AND EXTENSION, PERFORMED WITH SYNCHRONIZED BREATHING AND AEROBIC ACTIVITY. AS THIS SEQUENCE IS OFTEN PERFORMED AND RECOMMENDED BY MANY YOGA PRACTITIONERS, THERE IS A NEED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A BIOMECHANICAL MODEL TO SUPPORT ITS REPORTED CLINICAL BENEFITS. THIS REQUIRES A DETAILED KNOWLEDGE OF THE NATURE OF THE FORCES AND MOMENTS AT THE VARIOUS JOINTS INVOLVED. A SIMPLE MATHEMATICAL MODEL BASED ON RIGID BODY MECHANICS IS DEVELOPED FOR EACH OF THE SUN SALUTATION POSTURES. DYNAMIC MOMENTS WITH HIGH MAGNITUDES AND RATES, APPLIED WITH UNUSUAL DISTRIBUTION PATTERNS, OPTIMAL FOR OSTEOGENESIS, ARE FOUND TO OCCUR. ALSO, THE JOINTS ARE SUBJECTED TO SUBMAXIMAL LOADINGS THUS ENSURING THAT NONE OF THE JOINTS ARE OVERSTRESSED.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
13  573 17 DELAYED UNION OF STRESS FRACTURE OF THE FIRST RIB IN A YOGA INSTRUCTOR: A CASE REPORT. CASE: WE DESCRIBE THE CASE OF A 38-YEAR-OLD WOMAN, A YOGA INSTRUCTOR, WHO HAD PAIN IN THE RIGHT SHOULDER AND SCAPULAR REGION OF 4 MONTHS' DURATION WHILE PERFORMING YOGA. RADIOGRAPHY AND COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY DIAGNOSED DELAYED UNION OF A FIRST RIB STRESS FRACTURE. THE DELAYED UNION OF STRESS FRACTURE OF THE FIRST RIB WAS SUCCESSFULLY TREATED WITH THE LIMITING OF YOGA ACTIVITY AND LOW-INTENSITY PULSED ULTRASOUND (LIPUS). CONCLUSIONS: PHYSICIANS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT EVEN YOGA POSING CAN CAUSE STRESS FRACTURES OF THE FIRST RIB. LIPUS THERAPY MAY BE EFFECTIVE FOR DELAYED UNION IN ADDITION TO REST.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
14 2565 19 YOGA FOR CORRECTION OF LYMPHEDEMA'S IMPAIRMENT OF GAIT AS AN ADJUNCT TO LYMPHATIC DRAINAGE: A PILOT OBSERVATIONAL STUDY. INTRODUCTION: YOGA USED AS A MAJOR COMPONENT OF INTEGRATIVE TREATMENT PROTOCOL IN 14 INDIAN VILLAGE CAMPS IMPROVED QUALITY-OF-LIFE IN 425 LYMPHATIC FILARIASIS PATIENTS. THEY EXPERIENCED BETTER MOBILITY AND REDUCED DISABILITY. THIS PAPER DOCUMENTS THE GAIT ABNORMALITIES OBSERVED IN LOWER LIMB LYMPHEDEMA PATIENTS AND THE LOCOMOTOR CHANGES FOLLOWING INTEGRATIVE TREATMENT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: YOGA POSTURES WERE PERFORMED AS EXPLAINED BY TRADITIONAL YOGA PRACTICE IN TWO SESSIONS: BEFORE AYURVEDIC OIL MASSAGE WITHOUT COMPRESSION BANDAGES AND AFTER THE MASSAGE WITH COMPRESSION BANDAGES. EACH YOGA POSTURE LASTED FOR 5 MIN AND THE WHOLE SESSION ENDED IN 45 MIN. THROUGHOUT EACH SESSION, WE ADVISED PATIENTS TO DO LONG, DIAPHRAGMATIC BREATHING, CONCENTRATING ON EACH BREATH. THE FLEXION OF JOINTS WAS COORDINATED WITH EXHALATION AND EXTENSION WITH INHALATION. WE EDUCATED THE PATIENTS TO DO LONGER EXPIRATION THAN INSPIRATION. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A TOTAL OF 98 PATIENTS (133 LIMBS) ATTENDING THE 6(TH) MONTH FOLLOW-UP WERE EVALUATED. THE MOST COMMON GAIT ABNORMALITY WAS ANTALGIC GAIT. STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL ABNORMALITIES WERE OBSERVED IN HIP, KNEE AND ANKLE JOINTS. WE FOUND THAT YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT TO OTHER COMPONENTS IN INTEGRATIVE TREATMENT IMPROVED THE GAIT PROBLEMS. LONG STANDING LYMPHEDEMA CAUSED ALTERED GAIT AND JOINT DEFORMITIES. THIS WAS MOSTLY DUE TO INACTIVITY CAUSING MUSCLE WEAKNESS AND EDEMA WITHIN AND AROUND THE MUSCLES. BOTH LARGE AND SMALL LIMBS HAVE SHOWN SIGNIFICANT VOLUME REDUCTION (P < 0.01) DURING FOLLOW-UP AFTER 6 MONTHS. CONCLUSION: THERE CAN BE A MIXED ETIOLOGY FOR GAIT RELATED PROBLEMS IN LYMPHEDEMA PATIENTS. FURTHER STUDIES ARE RECOMMENDED TO UNDERSTAND THE CAUSES OF DEFORMITIES IN LYMPHEDEMA PATIENTS AND AN EXACT ROLE OF YOGA.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
15  322 14 ANKLE MOTION IN COMMON YOGA POSES. BACKGROUND: MOTION OF THE ANKLE IS ESSENTIAL FOR MANY YOGA POSES. AN UNDERSTANDING OF RANGE OF ANKLE MOTION DURING TYPICAL YOGA POSES MAY HELP THE CLINICIAN TO UNDERSTAND EXPECTED OUTCOMES OF PATIENTS WHEN RETURNING FROM ANKLE SURGERY OR INJURY TO YOGA. METHODS: THE BIOMECHANICS OF TWENTY HEALTHY ACTIVE YOGIS WERE COLLECTED DURING SEVEN YOGA POSES THAT ARE COMMON WITHIN THEIR PRACTICES. MOTION CAPTURE AND FORCE PLATES WERE USED TO ASSESS THE RANGE OF MOTION AND JOINT MOMENTS OF THE ANKLE FOR EACH POSE. RESULTS: ALL POSES RESULTED IN PLANTARFLEXION AND EXTERNAL ROTATION MOMENTS AT THE ANKLE JOINTS. JOINT LOADING WAS HIGHEST IN SINGLE LEG POSES. THE ARC OF MOTION USED BY THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS IN THE POSES WAS 29 DEGREES OF SAGITTAL MOTION, 20 DEGREES OF FRONTAL MOTION AND 35 DEGREES OF TRANSVERSE MOTION. DISCUSSION: ANKLE MOTION WAS EVALUATED WHEN HEALTHY YOGIS PERFORM STANDARD POSES. THESE RESULTS MAY HELP IN DISCUSSION WITH PATIENTS REGARDING EXPECTED OUTCOMES AFTER ANKLE INJURY OR SURGERY.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
16 1987 12 SPATIAL-TEMPORAL GRAPH CONVOLUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR YOGA ACTION RECOGNITION AND GRADING. THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTERNET HAS CHANGED OUR LIVES. MANY PEOPLE GRADUALLY LIKE ONLINE VIDEO YOGA TEACHING. HOWEVER, YOGA BEGINNERS CANNOT MASTER THE STANDARD YOGA POSES JUST BY LEARNING THROUGH VIDEOS, AND HIGH YOGA POSES CAN BRING GREAT DAMAGE OR EVEN DISABILITY TO THE BODY IF THEY ARE NOT STANDARD. TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, WE PROPOSE A YOGA ACTION RECOGNITION AND GRADING SYSTEM BASED ON SPATIAL-TEMPORAL GRAPH CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK. FIRSTLY, WE CAPTURE YOGA MOVEMENT DATA USING A DEPTH CAMERA. THEN WE LABEL THE YOGA EXERCISE VIDEOS FRAME BY FRAME USING LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY NETWORK; THEN WE EXTRACT THE SKELETAL JOINT POINT FEATURES SEQUENTIALLY USING GRAPH CONVOLUTION; THEN WE ARRANGE EACH VIDEO FRAME FROM SPATIAL-TEMPORAL DIMENSION AND CORRELATE THE JOINT POINTS IN EACH FRAME AND NEIGHBORING FRAMES WITH SPATIAL-TEMPORAL INFORMATION TO OBTAIN THE CONNECTION BETWEEN JOINTS. FINALLY, THE IDENTIFIED YOGA MOVEMENTS ARE PREDICTED AND GRADED. EXPERIMENT PROVES THAT OUR METHOD CAN ACCURATELY IDENTIFY AND CLASSIFY YOGA POSES; IT ALSO CAN IDENTIFY WHETHER YOGA POSES ARE STANDARD OR NOT AND GIVE FEEDBACK TO YOGIS IN TIME TO PREVENT BODY DAMAGE CAUSED BY NONSTANDARD POSES.	2022

18 2448 16 YOGA AND THE EXPERIENCE OF EMBODIMENT: A DISCUSSION OF POSSIBLE LINKS. THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON BODY IMAGE AND EMBODIMENT HAS BEEN A RECENT AREA OF FOCUS IN THE FIELD OF BODY IMAGE AND EATING DISORDERS. THIS PAPER COMPRISES A THEORETICAL DISCUSSION OF HOW THE PRACTICE OF YOGA CAN LEAD TO POSITIVE WAYS OF INHABITING THE BODY, SPECIFICALLY THROUGH THE LENS OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL THEORY OF EMBODIMENT. YOGA MAY ENHANCE THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE OF EMBODIMENT, BY HAVING A POSITIVE IMPACT ON EACH OF ITS FIVE DIMENSIONS: BODY CONNECTION AND COMFORT, AGENCY AND FUNCTIONALITY, ATTUNED SELF-CARE, SUBJECTIVE IMMERSION (RESISTING OBJECTIFICATION), AND EXPERIENCE AND EXPRESSION OF DESIRES. THE ARTICLE THEREFORE DESCRIBES EXAMPLES OF TEACHER-RELATED PRACTICES DURING YOGA THAT CAN ENHANCE EACH OF THESE DIMENSIONS. FURTHER, YOGA TEACHERS CAN CONSIDER THE VARIED PROTECTIVE PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL FACTORS DELINEATED BY THE DEVELOPMENTAL THEORY OF EMBODIMENT TO FACILITATE POSITIVE EMBODIMENT. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD EXPLICITLY INTEGRATE EMBODIMENT THEORY WITH YOGA INTERVENTIONS, AS WELL AS MEASURES THAT ASSESS BOTH POSSIBLE MECHANISMS OF CHANGE AND POSITIVE WAYS OF LIVING IN THE BODY.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
19 2714 14 YOGA LESSONS FOR CONSCIOUSNESS RESEARCH: A PARALIMBIC NETWORK BALANCING BRAIN RESOURCE ALLOCATION. CONSCIOUSNESS HAS BEEN PROPOSED TO PLAY A KEY ROLE IN SHAPING FLEXIBLE LEARNING AND AS SUCH IS THOUGHT TO CONFER AN EVOLUTIONARY ADVANTAGE. ATTENTION AND AWARENESS ARE THE PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANT UNDERLYING PROCESSES, YET THEIR PRECISE RELATIONSHIP IS PRESENTLY UNCLEAR. BOTH OF THESE PROCESSES MUST, HOWEVER, SERVE THE EVOLUTIONARY IMPERATIVES OF SURVIVAL AND PROCREATION. THEY ARE THUS INTIMATELY BOUND BY REWARD AND EMOTION TO HELP TO PRIORITIZE EFFICIENT BRAIN RESOURCE ALLOCATION IN ORDER TO PREDICT AND OPTIMIZE BEHAVIOR. HERE WE SHOW HOW THIS PROCESS IS SERVED BY A PARALIMBIC NETWORK CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF REGIONS LOCATED ON THE MIDLINE OF THE HUMAN BRAIN. USING MANY DIFFERENT TECHNIQUES, EXPERIMENTS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT THIS NETWORK IS EFFECTIVE AND SPECIFIC FOR SELF-AWARENESS AND CONTRIBUTES TO THE SENSE OF UNITY OF CONSCIOUSNESS BY ACTING AS A COMMON NEURAL PATH FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCES. INTERESTINGLY, HEMODYNAMIC ACTIVITY IN THE NETWORK DECREASES WITH FOCUSING ON EXTERNAL STIMULI, WHICH HAS LED TO THE IDEA OF A DEFAULT MODE NETWORK. THIS NETWORK IS ONE OF MANY NETWORKS THAT WAX AND VANE AS RESOURCES ARE ALLOCATED TO ACCOMMODATE THE DIFFERENT CYCLICAL NEEDS OF THE ORGANISM PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE FUNDAMENTAL PLEASURES AFFORDED BY EVOLUTION: FOOD, SEX, AND CONSPECIFICS. HERE WE HYPOTHESIZE, HOWEVER, THAT THE PARALIMBIC NETWORK SERVES A CRUCIAL ROLE IN BALANCING AND REGULATING BRAIN RESOURCE ALLOCATION, AND DISCUSS HOW IT CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS A LINK BETWEEN CURRENT THEORIES OF SO-CALLED "DEFAULT MODE," "RESTING STATE NETWORKS," AND "GLOBAL WORKSPACE." WE SHOW HOW MAJOR DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS OF SELF-AWARENESS AND SELF-CONTROL CAN ARISE FROM PROBLEMS IN THE PARALIMBIC NETWORK AS DEMONSTRATED HERE BY THE EXAMPLE OF ASPERGER SYNDROME. WE CONCLUDE THAT ATTENTION, AWARENESS, AND EMOTION ARE INTEGRATED BY A PARALIMBIC NETWORK THAT HELPS TO EFFICIENTLY ALLOCATE BRAIN RESOURCES TO OPTIMIZE BEHAVIOR AND HELP SURVIVAL.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
20  158 13 A RADICAL RN- BS NURSING CLASS: OUTCOMES FROM AN INTEGRATIVE YOGA ELECTIVE. WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF PSYCHONEUROIMMUNOLOGICAL RESPONSES AND THE KNOWN HIGH STRESS LEVELS OF NURSING STUDENTS, AS CARING NURSE EDUCATORS, WE HAVE BECOME ETHICALLY OBLIGATED TO REVISE AND RE-VISION OUR CURRENT NURSING EDUCATIONAL PRACTICES. NURSE EDUCATORS SHOULD BE MOTIVATED TO CREATE INNOVATIVE AND RADICAL CARING SCIENCE CURRICULAR APPROACHES, SO THAT OUR NURSES OF THE FUTURE ARE IN TURN SUPPORTED IN CREATING CARING- HEALING SUSTAINABLE BEDSIDE PRACTICES. THIS PAPER DETAILS THE OUTCOMES FROM AN UPPER LEVEL YOGA ELECTIVE IN AN RN- BSN PROGRAM. THE COURSE IS JUST ONE WITHIN AN INNOVATIVE HOLISTIC-INTEGRAL NURSING CURRICULUM THAT SUPPORTS NURSES IN PRACTICING SELF-CARE AS A WAY TO SUPPORT THEIR ABILITY TO CREATE CARING-HEALING MOMENTS AND SPACES FOR PATIENTS, IMPLEMENT CHANGE IN THE WORKPLACE, AND AVOID THE PERILS OF BURN-OUT RELATED TO LOW STRESS RESILIENCE, WHICH IS SO COMMON WITHIN THE NURSING PROFESSION.	2018

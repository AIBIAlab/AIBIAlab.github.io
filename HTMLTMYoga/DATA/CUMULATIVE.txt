1  706 159 EFFECT OF INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY ON MALE OBESITY AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS-A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: OBESITY IS A GROWING GLOBAL EPIDEMIC AND CAUSE OF NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. YOGA IS ONE OF THE EFFECTIVE WAYS TO REDUCE STRESS WHICH IS ONE OF THE CAUSES OF OBESITY. AIM: TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY (IAYT) YOGA MODULE ON ADULT MALE OBESITY IN AN URBAN SETTING. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RCT (RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL) WAS CONDUCTED FOR 14 WEEKS ON OBESE MALE SUBJECTS WITH YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS. TOTAL NUMBER OF SUBJECTS WERE 72 AND THEY WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS (YOGA N=37, CONTROL N=35). THE SUBJECTS WERE FROM AN URBAN SETTING OF MUMBAI AND WERE DOING YOGA FOR THE FIRST TIME. SPECIAL YOGA TRAINING OF IAYT WAS GIVEN TO YOGA GROUP FOR ONE AND HALF HOUR FOR 5 DAYS IN A WEEK FOR 14 WEEKS. THE CONTROL GROUP CONTINUED REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES AND NO SPECIFIC PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WAS GIVEN. THE ASSESSMENTS WERE ANTHROPOMETRIC PARAMETERS OF WEIGHT, BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), MAC (MID UPPER ARM CIRCUMFERENCES) OF LEFT AND RIGHT ARM, WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE (WC), HC (HIP CIRCUMFERENCE), WHR (WAIST HIP RATIO), SKF(SKIN FOLD THICKNESS OF BICEPS, TRICEPS, SUB SCAPULAR, SUPRAILIAC AND CUMULATIVE), PERCENTAGE BODY FAT BASED ON SKF AND PSYCHOLOGICAL QUESTIONNAIRES OF PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE (PSS) AND AAQW (ACCEPTANCE AND ACTION QUESTIONNAIRE FOR WEIGHT RELATED DIFFICULTY). THESE WERE TAKEN BEFORE AND AFTER INTERVENTION FOR BOTH YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS. WITHIN AND BETWEEN GROUP ANALYSIS & CORRELATION OF DIFFERENCES FROM POST TO PRE READINGS AMONG THE VARIABLES, WERE CARRIED OUT USING SPSS 21. RESULTS: THE ANTHROPOMETRIC AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS WERE IMPROVED IN BOTH THE GROUPS BUT CHANGES WERE SIGNIFICANT IN YOGA GROUP. CONCLUSION: INCORPORATING THE IAYT FOR OBESE MALE IN URBAN SETTING WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR OBESITY TREATMENT AND FOR REDUCING THE OBESITY RELATED PROBLEMS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
2 1038  30 EFFECTS OF YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC HEART FAILURE: A META-ANALYSIS. THE USE OF YOGA AS AN EFFECTIVE CARDIAC REHABILITATION IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC HEART FAILURE (CHF) REMAINS CONTROVERSIAL. WE PERFORMED A META-ANALYSIS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON EXERCISE CAPACITY AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) IN PATIENTS WITH CHF. METHODS: WE SEARCHED MEDLINE, COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS, EXCERPTA MEDICA DATABASE, LILACS, PHYSIOTHERAPY EVIDENCE DATABASE, THE SCIENTIFIC ELECTRONIC LIBRARY ONLINE, AND CUMULATIVE INDEX TO NURSING AND ALLIED HEALTH (FROM THE EARLIEST DATE AVAILABLE TO DECEMBER 2013) FOR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA VERSUS EXERCISE AND/OR OF YOGA VERSUS CONTROL ON EXERCISE CAPACITY (PEAKVO2) AND QUALITY-OF-LIFE (HRQOL) IN CHF. TWO REVIEWERS SELECTED STUDIES INDEPENDENTLY. WEIGHTED MEAN DIFFERENCES (WMDS) AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CIS) WERE CALCULATED, AND HETEROGENEITY WAS ASSESSED USING THE I2 TEST. TWO STUDIES MET THE SELECTION CRITERIA (TOTAL: 30 YOGA AND 29 CONTROL PATIENTS). THE RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT YOGA COMPARED WITH CONTROL HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON PEAK VO2 AND HRQOL. PEAK VO2, WMD (3.87 95% CI: 1.95 TO 5.80), AND GLOBAL HRQOL STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCES (-12.46 95% CI: -22.49 TO -2.43) IMPROVED IN THE YOGA GROUP COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. YOGA ENHANCES PEAK VO2 AND HRQOL IN PATIENTS WITH CHF AND COULD BE CONSIDERED FOR INCLUSION IN CARDIAC REHABILITATION PROGRAMS. LARGER RCTS ARE REQUIRED TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH CHF.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
3 2846  36 YOGA, HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE AND MENTAL WELL-BEING: A RE-ANALYSIS OF A META-ANALYSIS USING THE QUALITY EFFECTS MODEL. BACKGROUND: PROVIDE ROBUST AND PRACTICALLY RELEVANT INFORMATION REGARDING THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN YOGA, HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY-OF-LIFE (HRQOL), AND MENTAL WELL-BEING (MWB) IN OLDER ADULTS. METHODS: DATA WERE DERIVED FROM A RECENT META-ANALYSIS OF 12 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED YOGA TRIALS REPRESENTING 752 ADULTS >/=60 YEARS OF AGE. STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE EFFECT SIZES (ESS) WERE POOLED USING THE RECENTLY DEVELOPED QUALITY EFFECTS MODEL AND 95% COMPATIBILITY INTERVALS (CI). SMALL-STUDY EFFECTS WERE EXAMINED USING THE DOI PLOT AND LUIS FURUYA-KANAMORI (LFK) INDEX. SENSITIVITY AND CUMULATIVE META-ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED AS WELL AS PERCENTILE IMPROVEMENT, NUMBER NEEDED TO TREAT (NNT), AND NUMBER TO BENEFIT. THE GRADING OF RECOMMENDATIONS ASSESSMENT, DEVELOPMENT, AND EVALUATION (GRADE) INSTRUMENT WAS USED TO ASSESS THE STRENGTH OF THE EVIDENCE. RESULTS: YOGA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN BOTH HRQOL (ES = 0.51, 95% CI, 0.25-0.77, I2 = 63.1%) AND MWB (ES = 0.39, 95% CI, 0.15-0.63, I2 =56.2%). PERCENTILE IMPROVEMENTS WERE 19.5 FOR HRQOL AND 15.3 FOR MWB WHEREAS THE NNT WAS 4 FOR HRQOL AND 5 FOR MWB. AN ESTIMATED 378,222 AND 302,578 U.S. YOGA-PRACTICING ADULTS >/=65 YEARS OF AGE COULD POTENTIALLY IMPROVE THEIR HRQOL AND MWB, RESPECTIVELY. MAJOR ASYMMETRY SUGGESTIVE OF SMALL-STUDY EFFECTS WAS OBSERVED FOR MWB BUT NOT HRQOL. FURTHER EXAMINATION FOR ASYMMETRY REVEALED THAT GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN MWB WERE ASSOCIATED WITH MORE (151 VS. 68) MINUTES OF YOGA PER WEEK (P = .007). OVERALL STRENGTH OF EVIDENCE WAS CONSIDERED "HIGH" FOR HRQOL AND "MODERATE" FOR MWB. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA IS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN HRQOL AND MWB AMONG OLDER ADULTS, WITH APPROXIMATELY 150 MINUTES OR MORE PER WEEK POSSIBLY OPTIMAL.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
4 2741 114 YOGA PRACTICE FOR REDUCING THE MALE OBESITY AND WEIGHT RELATED PSYCHOLOGICAL DIFFICULTIES-A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: OBESITY IS A HEALTH DISORDER AND INCREASING ALL OVER THE WORLD. IT IS ALSO A CAUSE FOR MANY NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. YOGA PRACTICE REDUCES THE STRESS LEVEL WHICH MAY IMPROVE THE EATING HABITS AND HELP IN WEIGHT REDUCTION. AIM: TO ASSESS THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THE EFFECTS AFTER 3 MONTHS OF THE 14 WEEKS YOGA TRAINING ON OBESITY OF ADULT MALE IN AN URBAN SETTING. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS WAS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH PARALLEL GROUPS (YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS) ON MALE OBESE. TOTAL 80 SUBJECTS WITH BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) BETWEEN 25 TO 35 KG/CM(2) WERE ENROLLED AND RANDOMIZED INTO TWO EQUAL GROUPS IN WHICH 72 SUBJECTS (YOGA N = 37 AND CONTROL N=35) COMPLETED THE TRIAL. YOGA GROUP MEAN AGE +/- SD WAS 40.03+/-8.74 AND CONTROL GROUP MEAN AGE+/-SD WAS 42.20+/-12.06. A 14 WEEKS SPECIAL IAYT (INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY) YOGA TRAINING WAS GIVEN TO THE YOGA GROUP AND NO SPECIFIC ACTIVITY WAS GIVEN TO CONTROL GROUP. THE INTERIM RESULTS OF THIS STUDY AT 14 WEEKS WERE COVERED IN ANOTHER ARTICLE WHICH IS UNDER PROCESS. AFTER THE 14 WEEKS OF YOGA TRAINING THE YOGA GROUP WAS ASKED TO CONTINUE THE YOGA PRACTICE FOR THE NEXT 3 MONTHS AND THE CONTROL GROUP WAS NOT GIVEN ANY PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. THE FINAL OUTCOME IS COVERED IN THIS PAPER. THE ASSESSMENTS WERE ANTHROPOMETRIC PARAMETERS OF BODY WEIGHT (WT), BMI (BODY MASS INDEX), MAC (MID-UPPER ARM CIRCUMFERENCES OF LEFT AND RIGHT ARM), WC (WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE), HC (HIP CIRCUMFERENCE), WHR (WAIST HIP RATIO), SKF (SKIN FOLD THICKNESS) OF BICEPS, TRICEPS, SUB SCAPULAR, SUPRAILIAC AND CUMULATIVE SKIN FOLD THICKNESS VALUE), PERCENTAGE BODY FAT BASED ON SKF AND PSYCHOLOGICAL QUESTIONNAIRES OF PSS (PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE) AND AAQW (ACCEPTANCE AND ACTION QUESTIONNAIRE FOR WEIGHT RELATED DIFFICULTY). ASSESSMENTS WERE TAKEN AFTER 3 MONTHS OF YOGA TRAINING, FOR BOTH YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS. WITHIN GROUP, BETWEEN GROUP AND CORRELATION ANALYSES WERE CARRIED OUT USING SPSS 21. RESULTS: IMPROVEMENT IN ANTHROPOMETRIC AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS SUCH AS WT, PERCENTAGE BODY FAT, PSS WERE OBSERVED IN THE FINAL OUTCOME. ALSO, SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS SUCH AS AAQW SCORE WERE LOST IN THE FINAL OUTCOME, COMPARED TO INTERIM RESULTS. CONCLUSION: THE YOGA PRACTICE IS EFFECTIVE FOR OBESITY CONTROL FOR ADULT MALE IN AN URBAN SETTING.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
5 2479  28 YOGA AS AN ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY APPROACH FOR ARTHRITIS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. IN THE UNITED STATES, APPROXIMATELY 21% OF THE ADULTS SUFFER FROM ARTHRITIS. YOGA OFFERS ONE POSSIBLE WAY OF MANAGING ARTHRITIS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO LOOK AT STUDIES FROM 2010 TO JUNE 2013 AND EXAMINE WHETHER YOGA CAN BE AN EFFICACIOUS APPROACH FOR MANAGING ARTHRITIS. A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH FROM MEDLINE, CUMULATIVE INDEX TO NURSING AND ALLIED HEALTH, AND ALT HEALTHWATCH DATABASES WAS CONDUCTED FOR QUANTITATIVE ARTICLES INVOLVING ALL SCHOOLS OF YOGA. A TOTAL OF 9 ARTICLES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. FIVE OF THESE WERE FROM THE UNITED STATES AND 4 FROM INDIA. OF THE 9 STUDIES, 6 DEMONSTRATED POSITIVE CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL OR PHYSIOLOGICAL OUTCOMES RELATED TO ARTHRITIS. DESPITE THE LIMITATIONS NOT ALL STUDIES USING RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED DESIGN, HAVING SMALLER SAMPLE SIZES, HAVING DIFFERENT OUTCOMES, HAVING NONSTANDARDIZED YOGA INTERVENTION, NOT USING BEHAVIORAL THEORY, AND HAVING VARYING LENGTHS, YOGA APPEARS TO BE A PROMISING MODALITY FOR ARTHRITIS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
6 2860  32 YOGA-BASED EXERCISE IMPROVES HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE AND MENTAL WELL-BEING IN OLDER PEOPLE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS. OBJECTIVE: HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) AND MENTAL WELL-BEING ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HEALTHY AGEING. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY POSITIVELY IMPACTS BOTH HRQOL AND MENTAL WELL-BEING. YOGA IS A PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THAT CAN BE MODIFIED TO SUITS THE NEEDS OF OLDER PEOPLE AND IS GROWING IN POPULARITY. WE CONDUCTED A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WITH META-ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF YOGA-BASED EXERCISE ON HRQOL AND MENTAL WELL-BEING IN PEOPLE AGED 60+. METHODS: SEARCHES WERE CONDUCTED FOR RELEVANT TRIALS IN THE FOLLOWING ELECTRONIC DATABASES; MEDLINE, EMBASE, COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS, CINAHL, ALLIED AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE DATABASE, PSYCINFO AND THE PHYSIOTHERAPY EVIDENCE DATABASE (PEDRO) FROM INCEPTION TO JANUARY 2017. TRIALS THAT EVALUATED THE EFFECT OF PHYSICAL YOGA ON HRQOL AND/OR ON MENTAL WELL-BEING IN PEOPLE AGED 60+ YEARS WERE INCLUDED. DATA ON HRQOL AND MENTAL WELL-BEING WERE EXTRACTED. STANDARDISED MEAN DIFFERENCES AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CI) WERE CALCULATED USING RANDOM EFFECTS MODELS. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF TRIALS WAS ASSESSED USING THE PEDRO SCALE. RESULTS: TWELVE TRIALS OF HIGH METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY (MEAN PEDRO SCORE 6.1), TOTALLING 752 PARTICIPANTS, WERE IDENTIFIED AND PROVIDED DATA FOR THE META-ANALYSIS. YOGA PRODUCED A MEDIUM EFFECT ON HRQOL (HEDGES' G = 0.51, 95% CI 0.25-0.76, 12 TRIALS) AND A SMALL EFFECT ON MENTAL WELL-BEING (HEDGES' G = 0.38, 95% CI 0.15-0.62, 12 TRIALS). CONCLUSION: YOGA INTERVENTIONS RESULTED IN SMALL TO MODERATE IMPROVEMENTS IN BOTH HRQOL AND MENTAL WELL-BEING IN PEOPLE AGED 60+ YEARS. FURTHER, RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMAL DOSE OF YOGA TO MAXIMISE HEALTH IMPACT.

7 2426  27 YOGA AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH: INTEGRATIVE REVIEW OF INTERVENTION STUDIES. BACKGROUND: EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED IN SEVERAL FIELDS. OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE AND ANALYZE RESULTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN THE WORKPLACE REPORTED ALONG 10 YEARS AFTER THE FORMULATION OF THE NATIONAL POLICY OF INTEGRATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY PRACTICES. METHOD: WE LOCATED 10 STUDIES PUBLISHED FROM 2006 TO 2015 WHICH MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA, INCLUDED IN DATABASES CUMULATIVE INDEX OF NURSING AND ALLIED HEALTH LITERATURE (CINAHL), MEDICAL LITERATURE ANALYSES AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEM ONLINE (MEDLINE), WEB OF SCIENCE, SCOPUS, COCHRANE AND SCIENTIFIC ELECTRONIC LIBRARY ONLINE (SCIELO). ANALYZED VARIABLES WERE: PUBLICATION YEAR, AUTHORSHIP, TITLE, AIMS, RESULTS, AND CONCLUSIONS. INTERVENTIONS WERE CHARACTERIZED BASED ON YOGA STYLE, PRACTICES IMPLEMENTED, FREQUENCY AND DURATION OF SESSIONS, DURATION OF INTERVENTION, MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENTS, AND ADDITIONAL INTERVENTIONS. RESULTS: OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA HAS PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS ON WORKERS FROM DIFFERENT PROFESSIONAL CATEGORIES. HOWEVER, WE DID NOT FIND BENEFITS FOR SOME CONDITIONS, AND YOGA PRACTICE DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME POSITIVE EFFECTS ON ALL PRACTITIONERS. WORKERS' ADHERENCE TO PROGRAMS INFLUENCES THE RESULTS OF RESEARCH. MANY STUDIES DID NOT CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE IMPLEMENTED PROGRAMS. CONCLUSION: THE CHARACTERISTICS OF INTERVENTIONS SHOW SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES AMONG PROGRAMS, WHICH ENABLE A SYNTHESIS, BUT NOT COMPARISONS.	2018

9 1837  16 PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS IN COLLEGE STUDENTS. COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE VULNERABLE TO A CRITICAL PERIOD IN DEVELOPMENTAL MATURATION, FACING RIGOROUS ACADEMIC WORK, AND LEARNING HOW TO FUNCTION INDEPENDENTLY. PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS RUNNING AND BICYCLING HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE MOOD AND RELIEVE STRESS. HOWEVER, COLLEGE STUDENTS OFTEN HAVE LOW LEVELS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. YOGA IS AN ANCIENT PHYSICAL AND MENTAL ACTIVITY THAT AFFECTS MOOD AND STRESS. HOWEVER, STUDIES EXAMINING THE PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF YOGA ARE RARE IN PEER-REVIEWED JOURNALS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO ESTABLISH PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE FOR THE PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS IN YOUNG-ADULT COLLEGE STUDENTS. THE PRESENT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT YOGA HAS POSITIVE EFFECTS ON A PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL LEVEL THAT LEADS TO DECREASED LEVELS OF STRESS IN COLLEGE STUDENT. FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO EXAMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH DIFFERENT TYPES OF YOGIC PRACTICES ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF DIFFERENT COLLEGE SUBPOPULATIONS (E.G., OVERWEIGHT, SEDENTARY, AND SMOKERS).	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
10 2487  36 YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS FOLLOWING TRAUMA: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND QUANTITATIVE SYNTHESIS. DESPITE EVIDENCE OF THE PHYSIOLOGIC IMPACT OF TRAUMA, TREATMENTS ARE ONLY BEGINNING TO FOCUS ON THE IMPACT OF TRAUMA ON THE BODY. YOGA MAY BE A PROMISING TREATMENT FOR TRAUMA SEQUELAE, GIVEN RESEARCH THAT SUPPORTS YOGA FOR GENERAL DISTRESS. THE PRESENT STUDY AIMS TO SYSTEMATICALLY ASSESS AND QUANTITATIVELY SYNTHESIZE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS (POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER [PTSD], DEPRESSION, ANXIETY SYMPTOMS) FOLLOWING POTENTIALLY TRAUMATIC LIFE EVENTS. THE FOLLOWING ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE SYSTEMATICALLY SEARCHED: PSYCINFO, OVID MEDLINE/PUBMED, CUMULATIVE INDEX TO NURSING AND ALLIED HEALTH LITERATURE, AND EMBASE/EMBASE CLASSIC. GOOGLE SCHOLAR, MENDELEY, OPEN RESEARCH AND CONTRIBUTOR IDENTIFICATION, AND FIG SHARE WERE HAND SEARCHED POST HOC. THE REVIEW FOCUSED ON STUDIES WITH A COMPARISON GROUP THAT MEASURED PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS BEFORE AND AFTER INTERVENTION. AFTER SCREENING AND REVIEWING, 12 ARTICLES (N = 791) WERE INCLUDED, WITH INTERVENTIONS RANGING FROM 2 DAYS TO 16 WEEKS. IF A STUDY CONTAINED MULTIPLE CONDITIONS, BETWEEN-GROUPS DIFFERENCES WERE ONLY EXAMINED BETWEEN THE YOGA AND INACTIVE CONTROL GROUP. THOUGH OVERALL BETWEEN-GROUPS (YOGA VS. COMPARISON) EFFECT SIZES RANGED FROM DS = 0.40-1.06, THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND QUANTITATIVE SYNTHESIS DID NOT FIND STRONG EVIDENCE FOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR PTSD, DEPRESSION, AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS FOLLOWING TRAUMATIC LIFE EXPERIENCES DUE TO LOW QUALITY AND HIGH RISK OF BIAS OF STUDIES. AS YOGA HAS PROMISE FOR MANAGING PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS AMONG TRAUMA SURVIVORS, THIS REVIEW CALLS FOR MORE RIGOROUS DESIGN OF FUTURE STUDIES TO ALLOW DEFINITIVE CONCLUSIONS REGARDING THE USE OF YOGA IN MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT OF TRAUMA SURVIVORS.

11  563  31 CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYSIS OF HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE AND ELEMENTS OF YOGA PRACTICE. BACKGROUND: MIND-BODY PRACTICES SUCH AS YOGA HAVE BEEN STUDIED FOR THEIR GENERALLY POSITIVE EFFECTS ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL). THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HOW A PERSON PRACTICES YOGA AND THE PERSON'S HRQOL IS NOT KNOWN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: YOGA PRACTITIONERS WERE SENT INVITATIONS TO PARTICIPATE IN AN ONLINE SURVEY VIA EMAIL. YOGA CHARACTERISTICS, HRQOL, AND OTHER SOCIODEMOGRAPHICS WERE COLLECTED. ANALYSES OF DATA FROM 309 CONSENTING RESPONDERS EVALUATED ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN YOGA PRACTICE CHARACTERISTICS (USE OF YOGA TOOLS, LENGTH OF PRACTICE, LOCATION, METHOD, ETC.) AND THE 10-ITEM PROMIS GLOBAL HEALTH SCALE FOR BOTH PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENTS. RESULTS: MULTIVARIABLE REGRESSION MODELS DEMONSTRATED HIGHER MENTAL HEALTH SCORES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH REGULAR MEDITATION PRACTICE, HIGHER INCOME, AND THE METHOD OF PRACTICING IN A COMMUNITY GROUP CLASS (VERSUS ONE-ON-ONE). HIGHER PHYSICAL HEALTH SCORES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH LENGTH OF LIFETIME PRACTICE, TEACHER STATUS, KRISHNAMACHARYA YOGA STYLE, AND PRACTICING IN A YOGA SCHOOL/STUDIO (VERSUS AT HOME). CONCLUSIONS: MEDITATION PRACTICE IN YOGA IS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH MENTAL HEALTH. LENGTH OF LIFETIME YOGA PRACTICE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER PHYSICAL HEALTH, SUGGESTING YOGA HAS A POTENTIAL CUMULATIVE BENEFIT OVER TIME. DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AND METHODS OF PRACTICE MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH VARYING EFFECTS ON HEALTH OUTCOMES. COMPARATIVE CROSS-SECTIONAL AND LONGITUDINAL STUDIES ON THE VARIATIONS IN YOGA PRACTICE ARE NEEDED TO FURTHER CHARACTERIZE HEALTH BENEFITS OF YOGA.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
12 1831  40 PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTION, IYENGAR YOGA, AND COHERENT BREATHING: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED DOSING STUDY. BACKGROUND: EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD). STUDIES EVALUATING THE "DOSING" OF YOGA TREATMENT AND EFFICACY FOR MDD ARE NEEDED. THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF AN INTERVENTION COMBINING IYENGAR YOGA AND COHERENT BREATHING IN PARTICIPANTS WITH MDD AND DETERMINE THE OPTIMAL INTERVENTION DOSE. METHODS: THIRTY-TWO PARTICIPANTS (18 TO 65 Y OF AGE) DIAGNOSED WITH MDD WERE RANDOMIZED TO A HIGH-DOSE GROUP (HDG) OR A LOW-DOSE GROUP (LDG) OF YOGA AND COHERENT BREATHING FOR 12 WEEKS. THE HDG (N=15) INVOLVED THREE 90-MINUTE YOGA CLASSES AND FOUR 30-MINUTE HOMEWORK SESSIONS PER WEEK. THE LDG (N=15) INVOLVED TWO 90-MINUTE YOGA CLASSES AND THREE 30-MINUTE HOMEWORK SESSIONS PER WEEK. PARTICIPANTS WERE EVALUATED AT BASELINE, WEEK 4, WEEK 8, AND WEEK 12 WITH THE FOLLOWING INSTRUMENTS: POSITIVITY SELF-TEST, SPIELBERGER STATE ANXIETY INVENTORY, PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE-9, PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX, AND EXERCISE-INDUCED FEELING INVENTORY. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING INTENT-TO-TREAT METHODS. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN ALL OUTCOME MEASURES WERE FOUND FOR BOTH GROUPS, WITH ACUTE AND CUMULATIVE BENEFITS. ALTHOUGH THE HDG SHOWED GREATER IMPROVEMENTS ON ALL SCALES, BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCES DID NOT REACH SIGNIFICANCE, POSSIBLY DUE TO LACK OF POWER BECAUSE OF THE SMALL SAMPLE SIZE. CUMULATIVE YOGA MINUTES WERE CORRELATED WITH IMPROVEMENT IN OUTCOME MEASURES. LIMITATION: THIS DOSING STUDY DID NOT INCLUDE A NON-YOGA CONTROL. CONCLUSIONS: IMPROVEMENT IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS CORRELATED WITH CUMULATIVE YOGA PRACTICE. BOTH INTERVENTIONS REDUCED SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY AND INCREASED FEELINGS OF POSITIVITY. THE TIME COMMITMENT FOR YOGA PRACTICE NEEDS TO BE WEIGHED AGAINST BENEFITS WHEN DESIGNING YOGA INTERVENTIONS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
13  262  37 ACUTE AND CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF VINYASA YOGA ON AFFECT AND STRESS AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS PARTICIPATING IN AN EIGHT-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE VULNERABLE TO A CRITICAL PERIOD IN DEVELOPMENTAL MATURATION, FACING RIGOROUS ACADEMIC WORK AND LEARNING HOW TO FUNCTION INDEPENDENTLY. WESTERN AEROBIC EXERCISE (WAE), SUCH AS RUNNING AND BICYCLING, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE MOOD AND RELIEVE STRESS. HOWEVER, COLLEGE STUDENTS OFTEN HAVE LOW LEVELS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. YOGA IS AN ANCIENT PHYSICAL AND MENTAL PRACTICE THAT MAY AFFECT MOOD AND STRESS. HOWEVER, RIGOROUS STUDIES EXAMINING THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF YOGA ARE RARE IN PEERREVIEWED WESTERN JOURNALS. THE AIM OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO ESTABLISH PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE FOR THE ACUTE EFFECTS OF VINYASA YOGA ON AFFECT AND STRESS IN YOUNG-ADULT COLLEGE STUDENTS. METHODS: TWENTY HEALTHY COLLEGE STUDENTS AGE 18 YEARS AND OLDER WERE RECRUITED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PILOT STUDY. PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED A VINYASA YOGA CLASS AT A LOCAL STUDIO TWICE WEEKLY FOR 8 WEEKS. AFFECT AND STRESS WERE ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER EACH YOGA SESSION. MEASURES INCLUDED THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECTIVE SCHEDULE (PANAS) AND THE COHEN PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE. RESULTS: POSITIVE AFFECT SCORES INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (P < 0.05) FOR 14 OF THE 16 YOGA SESSIONS (MEAN INCREASE = 23.2%). NEGATIVE AFFECT DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PRE- TO POSTYOGA (P < 0.05) FOR 15 OF THE 16 SESSIONS (MEAN DECREASE = 22%). REPEATED MEASURES ANOVAS EXAMINING PRE-POST COMPOSITE SCORES ACROSS ALL 8 WEEKS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PANAS, BUT NOT STRESS SCORES. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA PRACTICE IS ASSOCIATED WITH ACUTE IMPROVEMENTS IN AFFECT IN A YOUNG-ADULT COLLEGE POPULATION. FUTURE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO EXAMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH DIFFERENT TYPES OF YOGA ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF DIFFERENT COLLEGE SUB-POPULATIONS (E.G., EATING DISORDERED, OVERWEIGHT/OBESE, SEDENTARY, AND SMOKERS).	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
14 2165  44 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA COMPARED TO ACTIVE AND INACTIVE CONTROLS ON PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN OLDER ADULTS- SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS. BACKGROUND: YOGA HAS BEEN RECOMMENDED AS A MUSCLE STRENGTHENING AND BALANCE ACTIVITY IN NATIONAL AND GLOBAL PHYSICAL ACTIVITY GUIDELINES. HOWEVER, THE EVIDENCE BASE ESTABLISHING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN IMPROVING PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) IN AN OLDER ADULT POPULATION NOT RECRUITED ON THE BASIS OF ANY SPECIFIC DISEASE OR CONDITION, HAS NOT BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEWED. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO SYNTHESISE EXISTING EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND HRQOL IN OLDER ADULTS NOT CHARACTERISED BY ANY SPECIFIC CLINICAL CONDITION. METHODS: THE FOLLOWING DATABASES WERE SYSTEMATICALLY SEARCHED IN SEPTEMBER 2017: MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, CINAHL PLUS, SCOPUS, WEB OF SCIENCE, COCHRANE LIBRARY, EMBASE, SPORTDISCUS, AMED AND PROQUEST DISSERTATIONS & THESES GLOBAL. STUDY INCLUSION CRITERIA: OLDER ADULT PARTICIPANTS WITH MEAN AGE OF 60 YEARS AND ABOVE, NOT RECRUITED ON THE BASIS OF ANY SPECIFIC DISEASE OR CONDITION; YOGA INTERVENTION COMPARED WITH INACTIVE CONTROLS (EXAMPLE: WAIT-LIST CONTROL, EDUCATION BOOKLETS) OR ACTIVE CONTROLS (EXAMPLE: WALKING, CHAIR AEROBICS); PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND HRQOL OUTCOMES; AND RANDOMISED/CLUSTER RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH. A VOTE COUNTING ANALYSIS AND META-ANALYSIS WITH STANDARDISED EFFECT SIZES (HEDGES' G) COMPUTED USING RANDOM EFFECTS MODELS WERE CONDUCTED. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 27 RECORDS FROM 22 RCTS WERE INCLUDED (17 RCTS ASSESSED PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND 20 ASSESSED HRQOL). THE META-ANALYSIS REVEALED SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS (5% LEVEL OF SIGNIFICANCE) FAVOURING THE YOGA GROUP FOR THE FOLLOWING PHYSICAL FUNCTION OUTCOMES COMPARED WITH INACTIVE CONTROLS: BALANCE (EFFECT SIZE (ES) = 0.7), LOWER BODY FLEXIBILITY (ES = 0.5), LOWER LIMB STRENGTH (ES = 0.45); COMPARED WITH ACTIVE CONTROLS: LOWER LIMB STRENGTH (ES = 0.49), LOWER BODY FLEXIBILITY (ES = 0.28). FOR HRQOL, SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS FAVOURING YOGA WERE FOUND COMPARED TO INACTIVE CONTROLS FOR: DEPRESSION (ES = 0.64), PERCEIVED MENTAL HEALTH (ES = 0.6), PERCEIVED PHYSICAL HEALTH (ES = 0.61), SLEEP QUALITY (ES = 0.65), AND VITALITY (ES = 0.31); COMPARED TO ACTIVE CONTROLS: DEPRESSION (ES = 0.54). CONCLUSION: THIS REVIEW IS THE FIRST TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA WITH ACTIVE AND INACTIVE CONTROLS IN OLDER ADULTS NOT CHARACTERISED BY A SPECIFIC CLINICAL CONDITION. RESULTS INDICATE THAT YOGA INTERVENTIONS IMPROVE MULTIPLE PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND HRQOL OUTCOMES IN THIS POPULATION COMPARED TO BOTH CONTROL CONDITIONS. THIS STUDY PROVIDES ROBUST EVIDENCE FOR PROMOTING YOGA IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY GUIDELINES FOR OLDER ADULTS AS A MULTIMODAL ACTIVITY THAT IMPROVES ASPECTS OF FITNESS LIKE STRENGTH, BALANCE AND FLEXIBILITY, AS WELL AS MENTAL WELLBEING.

15 2182  34 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON POSITIVE MENTAL HEALTH AMONG HEALTHY ADULTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVES: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO PRESENT AN OVERVIEW OF THE RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON POSITIVE MENTAL HEALTH (PMH) AMONG NON-CLINICAL ADULT POPULATIONS. METHODS: THIS WAS A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS, INCLUDING A RISK OF BIAS ASSESSMENT. THE ELECTRONIC DATABASES PUBMED/MEDLINE, SCOPUS, INDMED, AND THE COCHRANE LIBRARY WERE SEARCHED FROM 1975 TO 2015. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON PMH AMONG A HEALTHY ADULT POPULATION WERE SELECTED. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 17 RCTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE META-ANALYSIS. FOUR INDICATORS OF PMH WERE FOUND: PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING, LIFE SATISFACTION, SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND MINDFULNESS. A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING IN FAVOR OF YOGA OVER NO ACTIVE CONTROL WAS FOUND. OVERALL RISK OF BIAS WAS UNCLEAR DUE TO INCOMPLETE REPORTING. CONCLUSIONS: THE CURRENT BODY OF RESEARCH OFFERS WEAK EVIDENCE THAT THE PRACTICE OF YOGA CONTRIBUTES TO AN INCREASE IN PMH AMONG ADULTS FROM NON-CLINICAL POPULATIONS IN GENERAL. YOGA WAS FOUND TO CONTRIBUTE TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING WHEN COMPARED TO NO INTERVENTION BUT NOT COMPARED TO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. FOR LIFE SATISFACTION (EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING), SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS (SOCIAL WELL-BEING), AND MINDFULNESS NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS FOR YOGA WERE FOUND OVER ACTIVE OR NON-ACTIVE CONTROLS. DUE TO THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF STUDIES, THE HETEROGENEITY OF THE INTERVENTION, AND PERHAPS THE WAY PMH IS BEING MEASURED, ANY DEFINITE CONCLUSIONS ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PMH CANNOT BE DRAWN.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
16 1882  25 REDUCING ALLOSTATIC LOAD IN DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY DISORDERS: PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND YOGA PRACTICE AS ADD-ON THERAPIES. THE ALLOSTATIC LOAD (AL) INDEX CONSTITUTES A USEFUL TOOL TO OBJECTIVELY ASSESS THE BIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF CHRONIC STRESS IN CLINICAL PRACTICE. AL INDEX HAS BEEN POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH CUMULATIVE CHRONIC STRESS (PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESSORS) AND WITH A HIGH RISK TO DEVELOP PATHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS (E.G., METABOLIC SYNDROME, CARDIOVASCULAR PATHOLOGY, INFLAMMATORY DISORDERS) AND THE SO-CALLED STRESS-RELATED PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS, INCLUDING ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS. CHRONIC STRESS HAS NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON BRAIN NEUROPLASTICITY, ESPECIALLY ON HIPPOCAMPAL NEUROGENESIS AND THESE EFFECTS MAY BE REVERSED BY ANTIDEPRESSANT TREATMENTS. SEVERAL EVIDENCES INDICATE THAT NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS BASED ON PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND YOGA PRACTICE MAY ADD SYNERGIZING BENEFITS TO CLASSICAL TREATMENTS (ANTIDEPRESSANT AND BENZODIAZEPINES) FOR DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, REDUCING THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF CHRONIC STRESS. THE AIM OF THIS REVIEW IS TO PROVIDE A GENERAL OVERVIEW OF CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON AL AND CHRONIC STRESS IN RELATION TO DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND YOGA PRACTICE.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
17  495  24 COMBATING THE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC THROUGH YOGA: RECOMMENDATION FROM AN OVERVIEW. GLOBALLY, THE PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH OF THE PEOPLE IS BEING AFFECTED DUE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. GIVEN THE FACT THAT NUMEROUS SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS ALREADY EXIST ON YOGA AND MENTAL HEALTH, IT BECOMES VITAL TO UNDERTAKE AN OVERVIEW ON THE SAME. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE OVERVIEW WAS TO SUMMARISE THE EVIDENCE FROM DIFFERENT SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF DISTINCT YOGA INTERVENTIONS USED TO IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH AND RECOMMEND YOGA PRACTICES FOR THE SAME. THE PROTOCOL WAS REGISTERED ON PROSPERO (CRD42020185221). MEDLINE VIA PUBMED, COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR WERE SEARCHED FOR RELEVANT LITERATURE. SEARCH TERMS USED WERE "YOGA PRACTICE, MENTAL HEALTH AND SYSTEMATIC REVIEW". REVIEWS FROM EARLIEST POSSIBLE DATE TILL MAY 2020, INCLUDING THOSE EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF ANY SINGLE OR COMBINATION OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON MENTAL HEALTH REPORTED ON CHILDREN, YOUTH AND ADULTS WERE SELECTED. THE ASSESSMENT OF MULTIPLE SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS (AMSTAR) TOOL WAS USED TO EVALUATE THE EVIDENCE OF THE INCLUDED REVIEWS. OUT OF THE 90 REVIEWS FOUND, EIGHT UNIQUE REVIEWS WERE SELECTED FOR THE OVERVIEW. OVERALL, 243 STUDIES WERE ANALYZED, WITH AN OVERLAP OF ONLY 6 STUDIES ACROSS THE REVIEWS. OUT OF 8 REVIEWS, ONLY 2 WERE OF HIGH QUALITY AND THE REST WERE OF MODERATE QUALITY. OWING TO HETEROGENEITY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES, ONLY DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS WAS POSSIBLE. THE RESULTS OF THE REVIEW INDICATE MODERATE TO POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON THE MENTAL HEALTH PARAMETERS. PRACTICING YOGA (PHYSICAL POSTURES, BHRAMARY PRANAYAM, MINDFULNESS MEDITATION, SAHAJ YOGA AND LAUGHTER THERAPY) CAN BE BENEFICIAL TO IMPROVE PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH OF THE PEOPLE DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.	2021

A TOTAL OF 10 STUDIES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. DESIGNS WERE 2 PRE-POST TESTS AND 8 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. MAJORITY OF THE INTERVENTIONS WERE ABLE TO ENHANCE QUITTING SMOKING RATES IN THE PARTICIPANTS UNDER STUDY. YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS HOLD PROMISE FOR SMOKING CESSATION. SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS INCLUDE SHORT FOLLOW-UP MEASUREMENTS AND SHORT DURATION OF INTERVENTION.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
19 1856  34 RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW. PURPOSE: YOGA IS INCREASINGLY USED AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY TO MANAGE DISEASE AND TREATMENT-RELATED SIDE EFFECTS IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER AND HAS RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF STUDIES EXPLORING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW EXAMINES WHETHER YOGA INTERVENTIONS PROVIDE ANY MEASURABLE BENEFIT, BOTH PHYSICALLY AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY, FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER. THE RESULTS WILL INFORM FUTURE RESEARCH IN THIS FIELD AND ADVANCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF YOGA PROGRAMMES. METHODS: WE PERFORMED ELECTRONIC SEARCHES OF MEDLINE, PSYCHINFO, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, WEB OF SCIENCE AND SCOPUS FOR ARTICLES PUBLISHED UP TO JUNE 2012. ONLY RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) WERE INCLUDED AND METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY RATING SCORES WERE DETERMINED USING THE PEDRO (PHYSIOTHERAPY EVIDENCE DATABASE) SCALE. RESULTS: ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-TWO STUDIES WERE IDENTIFIED THROUGH A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH OF EIGHT ELECTRONIC DATABASES. ONLY PUBLISHED MANUSCRIPTS THAT EMPLOYED A RCT DESIGN WERE INCLUDED (N = 18). THE SAMPLE SIZES FOR THESE STUDIES VARIED WIDELY FROM 18 TO 164 PARTICIPANTS AND THE ASSOCIATED PEDRO SCORES RANGED FROM 1 (POOR) TO 8 (GOOD). ALL 18 STUDIES REPORTED POSITIVE EFFECTS FOR TREATMENT-RELATED SIDE EFFECTS IN FAVOUR OF THE YOGA INTERVENTIONS, WITH THE GREATEST IMPACT ON GLOBAL QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) SCORES AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING. CONCLUSION: RESULTS FROM THE FEW RCTS SUGGEST THERE IS MODERATE TO GOOD EVIDENCE THAT YOGA MAY BE A USEFUL PRACTICE FOR WOMEN RECOVERING FROM BREAST CANCER TREATMENTS. LARGE-SCALE RCTS USING OBJECTIVE MEASURES AND PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES WITH LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP ARE NEEDED TO SUBSTANTIATE WHETHER THE BENEFITS ARE TRUE AND SUSTAINABLE.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
20  826  39 EFFECT OF YOGA ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVE: INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) IN PATIENTS WITH CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DISORDERS. METHODS: A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED ON THE PUBMED-NCBI, EBSCO HOST, COCHRANE LIBRARY, SCOPUS AND SCIENCEDIRECT DATABASES UNTIL 05 APRIL 2021. ONLY RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH OR FRENCH WERE INCLUDED AND HAD TO COMPARE YOGA TO ANOTHER INTERVENTION GROUP OR A CONTROL GROUP. THEY ALSO HAD TO CLEARLY MEASURE HRQOL. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY WAS ASSESSED WITH THE REVISED COCHRANE RISK-OF-BIAS TOOL FOR RANDOMIZED TRIALS AND THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE WAS EVALUATED USING THE GRADING OF RECOMMENDATIONS ASSESSMENT, DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION (GRADE) CRITERIA. RESULTS: SIXTEEN STUDIES WERE FOUND, INCLUDING SIX FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, FIVE FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE, TWO FOR STROKE, ONE FOR DEMENTIA, ONE FOR EPILEPSY AND ONE FOR BRAIN TUMOUR. ONLY 12 STUDIES PERFORMED BETWEEN-GROUP STATISTICS AND 8 FOUND A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS AFTER TREATMENT. WHEN YOGA WAS COMPARED TO NO INTERVENTION, THE RESULTS WERE GENERALLY IN FAVOUR OF THE YOGA GROUP, BUT WHEN YOGA WAS COMPARED TO ANOTHER INTERVENTION PROGRAMME, THERE WAS GENERALLY NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS. THERE WERE MANY DIFFERENT HRQOL QUESTIONNAIRES, EVEN WITHIN THE SAME DISEASE, WHICH REDUCES THE COMPARABILITY OF STUDIES. CONCLUSIONS: WITH LOW TO MODERATE QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE, YOGA SEEMS EFFECTIVE TO IMPROVE HRQOL IN PEOPLE WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE. FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, STROKE, DEMENTIA, EPILEPSY AND BRAIN TUMOUR, THE QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE IS STILL INSUFFICIENT TO CONCLUDE OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA.	2021

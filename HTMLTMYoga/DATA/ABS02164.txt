1 2164 127 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND SELF-ESTEEM ON MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS-A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS FOUND THAT YOGA CAN ENHANCE QUALITY OF LIFE AND EASE MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. THE STUDY EXAMINED WHETHER SELF-ESTEEM MEDIATED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE, FATIGUE AND MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS, UTILIZING VALIDATED OUTCOME MEASURES. STUDY DESIGN: THIS IS A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA WITH THOSE OF USUAL CARE IN 40 BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WHO SUFFERED FROM MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS. ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED ALL 3 ASSESSMENTS (WEEK 0, WEEK 12, AND WEEK 24) AND PROVIDED FULL DATA. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: OUTCOMES WERE MEASURED USING SELF-RATING INSTRUMENTS. MEDIATION ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED USING SPSS. RESULTS: SELF-ESTEEM MEDIATED THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON TOTAL MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS (B=-2.11, 95% BCI [-5.40 TO -0.37]), PSYCHOLOGICAL MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS (B=-0.94, 95% BCI [-2.30 TO -0.01]), AND UROGENITAL MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS (B=-0.66, 95% BCI [-1.65 TO -0.15]), QUALITY OF LIFE (B=8.04, 95% BCI [3.15-17.03]), SOCIAL WELL-BEING (B=1.80, 95% BCI [0.54-4.21]), EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING (B=1.62, 95% BCI [0.70-3.34]), FUNCTIONAL WELL-BEING (B=1.84, 95% BCI [0.59-4.13]), AND FATIGUE (B=4.34, 95% BCI [1.28-9.55]). SELF-ESTEEM HAD NO EFFECT ON SOMATOVEGETATIVE MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS (B=-0.50, 95% BCI N.S.) OR ON PHYSICAL WELL-BEING (B=0.79, 95% BCI N.S.). CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS SUPPORT THE ASSUMPTION THAT SELF-ESTEEM PLAYS A VITAL ROLE IN THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF YOGA AND THAT YOGA CAN HAVE LONG-TERM BENEFITS FOR WOMEN DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER AND UNDERGOING MENOPAUSAL TRANSITION.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
2 1432  23 IMPROVING PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH IN FRONTLINE MENTAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS: YOGA-BASED STRESS MANAGEMENT VERSUS COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL STRESS MANAGEMENT. THE NEED FOR BRIEF, LOW-COST, EASILY DISSEMINABLE AND EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS TO PROMOTE HEALTHY LIFESTYLES IS HIGH. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS. WE DEVELOPED TWO STUDIES TO COMPARE THE IMPACTS OF COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL STRESS MANAGEMENT (CBSM) AND YOGA BASED STRESS MANAGEMENT (YBSM) INTERVENTIONS FOR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS. STUDY 1 OFFERED AN 8-WEEK YBSM INTERVENTION TO 37 MENTAL HEALTHCARE PARTICIPANTS AND COLLECTED HEALTH DATA PRE AND POST. STUDY 2 OFFERED YBSM AND CBSM CLASSES TO 40 RANDOMLY ASSIGNED MENTAL HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND COLLECTED MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH DATA AT FOUR TIME POINTS. IN STUDY 1, USING T-TESTS, THE YBSM INTERVENTION AFFECTED A NUMBER OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL WELLBEING INDICES PRE TO POST. IN STUDY 2, USING LINEAR MIXED MODELING, BOTH YBSM AND CBSM GROUPS IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY (P <.05) IN FRUIT AND VEGETABLE INTAKE, HEART RATE, ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION, RELAXATION AND AWARENESS, PROFESSIONAL QUALITY OF LIFE, COMPASSION SATISFACTION, BURNOUT, DEPRESSION, AND STRESS LEVELS. THERE WAS A GROUP BY TIME EFFECT FOR COPING CONFIDENCE (CBSM INCREASED MORE, P<.05, F = 4.34), PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (YBSM INCREASED MORE, P<.05, F = 3.47), OVERALL MENTAL HEALTH (YBSM INCREASED MORE, P<.10, F =5.32), AND SECONDARY TRAUMATIC STRESS (YBSM DECREASED MORE, P<.10, F = 4.89). YBSM AND CBSM APPEAR TO BE USEFUL FOR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS' MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH. YBSM DEMONSTRATES SOME BENEFIT ABOVE AND BEYOND THE EXTREMELY WELL-STUDIED AND EMPIRICALLY SUPPORTED CBSM, INCLUDING INCREASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, OVERALL MENTAL HEALTH, AND DECREASED SECONDARY TRAUMATIC STRESS BENEFITS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
3 1229  29 FEASIBILITY AND IMPACT OF AN 8-WEEK INTEGRATIVE YOGA PROGRAM IN PEOPLE WITH MODERATE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS-RELATED DISABILITY: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: THIS PILOT STUDY DETERMINED THE FEASIBILITY OF A SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED 8-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE WITH MODERATE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS)-RELATED DISABILITY. WE EXPLORED THE PROGRAM'S EFFECT ON QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AND PHYSICAL AND MENTAL PERFORMANCE. METHODS: WE USED A SINGLE-GROUP DESIGN WITH REPEATED MEASUREMENTS AT BASELINE, POSTINTERVENTION, AND 8-WEEK FOLLOW-UP. FEASIBILITY WAS EXAMINED THROUGH COST, RECRUITMENT, RETENTION, ATTENDANCE, AND SAFETY. OUTCOMES INCLUDED THE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS QUALITY OF LIFE INVENTORY (MSQLI), 12-ITEM MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS WALKING SCALE (MSWS-12), TIMED 25-FOOT WALK TEST (T25FW), 6-MINUTE WALK TEST (6MWT), NINE-HOLE PEG TEST (NHPT), FIVE-TIMES SIT-TO-STAND TEST (FTSTS), MULTIDIRECTIONAL REACH TEST (MDRT), MAXIMUM EXPIRATORY PRESSURE, AND PACED AUDITORY SERIAL ADDITION TEST-3'' (PASAT-3''). RESULTS: FOURTEEN PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE STUDY. THE PROGRAM WAS FEASIBLE. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT MAIN EFFECTS ON THE 36-ITEM SHORT FORM HEALTH STATUS SURVEY MENTAL COMPONENT SUMMARY (SF-36 MCS), MODIFIED FATIGUE IMPACT SCALE (MFIS), BLADDER CONTROL SCALE (BLCS), PERCEIVED DEFICITS QUESTIONNAIRE (PDQ), MENTAL HEALTH INVENTORY (MHI), MSWS-12, T25FW, NHPT, PASAT-3'', 6MWT, FTSTS, AND MDRT-BACK. IMPROVEMENTS WERE FOUND ON THE SF-36 MCS, MFIS, BLCS, PDQ, MHI, AND MSWS-12 BETWEEN BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION. THE EFFECT ON PDQ PERSISTED AT FOLLOW-UP. IMPROVEMENTS WERE FOUND ON THE T25FW, NHPT, 6MWT, FTSTS, AND MDRT-BACK BETWEEN BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION THAT PERSISTED AT FOLLOW-UP. THE PASAT-3'' DID NOT CHANGE BETWEEN BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION BUT DID BETWEEN POSTINTERVENTION AND FOLLOW-UP. CONCLUSIONS: THE YOGA PROGRAM WAS SAFE AND FEASIBLE. IMPROVEMENTS IN CERTAIN MEASURES OF QOL AND PERFORMANCE WERE SEEN AT POSTINTERVENTION AND FOLLOW-UP.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
4 2655  26 YOGA IMPROVES QUALITY OF LIFE AND FALL RISK-FACTORS IN A SAMPLE OF PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN AND TYPE 2 DIABETES. OBJECTIVE: ASSESS PRE TO-POST OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN AND TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM) RANDOMIZED TO AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION OR USUAL CARE. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED IF THEY SELF-REPORTED: CHRONIC PAIN; T2DM; >18 YEARS OLD; NO EXERCISE RESTRICTIONS OR CONSISTENT YOGA; AND CONSENTED TO THE STUDY. RESULTS: AFTER YOGA, THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN: BRIEF PAIN INVENTORY PAIN INTERFERENCE (49+/-15.00 VS. 41.25+/-19.46, P=.034); FULLERTON ADVANCED BALANCE SCALE (14.2+/-14.1 VS. 20.4+/-13.5, P=.03); UPPER EXTREMITY STRENGTH (7.7+/-6.3 VS.10.8+/-6.5, P=.02); LOWER EXTREMITY STRENGTH (4.1+/-3.8 VS. 6.7+/-4.8, P=.02); AND RAND 36-ITEM HEALTH SURVEY QUALITY OF LIFE SCORES (81.1+/-7.7 VS. 91.9+/-8.9, P=.04). BALANCE SCORES BECAME SIGNIFICANTLY WORSE DURING THE 8 WEEKS FOR PEOPLE RANDOMIZED TO THE CONTROL (27.1+/-9.9 VS. 21.7+/-13.4,=P.01). CONCLUSION: DATA FROM THIS SMALL RCT INDICATES YOGA MAY BE THERAPEUTIC AND MAY IMPROVE MULTIPLE OUTCOMES IN THIS SEEMINGLY AT-RISK POPULATION.

5 1019  31 EFFECTS OF WEEKLY ONE-HOUR HATHA YOGA THERAPY ON RESILIENCE AND STRESS LEVELS IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA-SPECTRUM DISORDERS: AN EIGHT-WEEK RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA THERAPY ON RESILIENCE, BRAIN-DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR (BDNF) LEVELS, AND SALIVARY ALPHA AMYLASE (SAA) ACTIVITY IN PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA-SPECTRUM DISORDERS. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: SINGLE-BLINDED, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY IN WHICH OUTPATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA OR RELATED PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS (ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES, 10TH REVISION) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A YOGA OR A CONTROL GROUP. SETTING: NOVEMBER 2012-APRIL 2013 AT YAMANASHI PREFECTURAL KITA HOSPITAL, JAPAN. INTERVENTIONS: IN THE YOGA GROUP, PATIENTS RECEIVED WEEKLY 1-HOUR HATHA YOGA SESSIONS, IN ADDITION TO REGULAR TREATMENT, FOR 8 WEEKS. THOSE IN THE CONTROL GROUP UNDERWENT REGULAR TREATMENT, WHICH INCLUDED A DAYCARE REHABILITATION PROGRAM. OUTCOME MEASURES: ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED THE 25-ITEM RESILIENCE SCALE (RS), POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SYNDROME SCALE (PANSS), PLASMA AND SALIVARY BDNF LEVEL, AND SAA ACTIVITY. RESULTS: FIFTY PATIENTS PARTICIPATED (25 IN EACH GROUP; MEAN AGE+/-STANDARD DEVIATION, 50.9+/-11.3 YEARS; MEAN DURATION OF ILLNESS, 25.0+/-10.3 YEARS; MEAN TOTAL PANSS SCORE, 78.2+/-17.3). NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN CHANGES IN ANY VARIABLE FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 8 WERE FOUND BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS (CHANGES IN THE YOGA GROUP VERSUS THE CONTROL GROUP: RS SCORE, -1.6+/-19.9 VERSUS 0.3+/-17.2; PANSS SCORE, 0.5+/-12.0 VERSUS 5.0+/-15.6; PLASMA BDNF, 41.6+/-377.0 PG/DL VERSUS 73.4+/-346.0 PG/DL; SAA, -26.2+/-72.6 KU/L VERSUS -13.8+/-68.0 KU/L, RESPECTIVELY). CONCLUSIONS: ADJUNCT YOGA THERAPY SHOWED NO POSITIVE CHANGES IN RESILIENCE LEVEL OR STRESS MARKERS. DURATION AND INTENSITY OF YOGA SESSIONS AND THE FOCUS ON PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC ILLNESS MAY EXPLAIN THE NEGATIVE OBSERVATIONS IN LIGHT OF PAST POSITIVE EVIDENCE REGARDING YOGA THERAPY.	2014

OBJECTIVES: ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS RESULTS IN A MULTIDIMENSIONAL DISABILITY WHICH DEMANDS A POLYGONAL APPROACH. ALTHOUGH PHYSIOTHERAPY PROVES AN ESSENTIAL FOR A COMPLETE AND COMPREHENSIVE RECOVERY IN ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS, EVIDENCE ALSO SUGGEST THE ROLE OF YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT, HENCE THIS STUDY INVESTIGATE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS. METHODS: THIS IS A QUASI-RANDOMISED CONTROL STUDY. A PRE-DIAGNOSED SUBACUTE AND CHRONIC ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS OF SHOULDER, BETWEEN THE AGE GROUP OF 35-60 YEARS OF BOTH GENDERS OF TOTAL 40 PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO GROUP 'A' (YOGASANA) AND GROUP 'B' (PHYSIOTHERAPY). THE PARAMETERS OF PAIN, JOINT MOBILITY AND FUNCTIONAL DISABILITIES WERE MEASURED AT THE BASELINE AND AFTER FOUR-WEEKS. RESULTS: THE MEAN AGE OF GROUP 'A' WAS 45.4 +/- 7.78 YEARS WHEREAS 50.05 +/- 5.98 YEARS WAS IN GROUP 'B'. INTRAGROUP ANALYSIS FOR BOTH THE GROUPS SHOWED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ALL THE STUDY VARIABLES. WHEREAS IN INTERGROUP ANALYSIS YOGASANA WAS FOUND TO BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IN IMPROVING SHOULDER ABDUCTION MOBILITY, P=0.03, EFFECT SIZE R=0.35 AND ALSO IN SHOULDER FLEXION (P=0.15, R=0.23) AND SHOULDER INTERNAL ROTATION (P=0.07, R=0.3), THOUGH STATISTICALLY NOT SIGNIFICANT, IN VIEW OF SMALL EFFECT SIZE RESPONSE. CONCLUSIONS: BOTH TECHNIQUES IMPROVED THE FUNCTIONAL STATUS IN ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS, HOWEVER ADDITIONAL EFFECTS ON JOINT MOBILITY WAS DEMONSTRATED BY YOGASANA.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
8 1468  30 INNER ENGINEERING PRACTICES AND ADVANCED 4-DAY ISHA YOGA RETREAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CANNABIMIMETIC EFFECTS WITH INCREASED ENDOCANNABINOIDS AND SHORT-TERM AND SUSTAINED IMPROVEMENT IN MENTAL HEALTH: A PROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL STUDY OF MEDITATORS. BACKGROUND: ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION ARE COMMON IN THE MODERN WORLD, AND THERE IS GROWING DEMAND FOR ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES SUCH AS MEDITATION. MEDITATION CAN DECREASE PERCEIVED STRESS AND INCREASE GENERAL WELL-BEING, ALTHOUGH THE PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISM IS NOT WELL-CHARACTERIZED. ENDOCANNABINOIDS (ECBS), LIPID MEDIATORS ASSOCIATED WITH ENHANCED MOOD AND REDUCED ANXIETY/DEPRESSION, HAVE NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY STUDIED AS BIOMARKERS OF MEDITATION EFFECTS. OUR AIM WAS TO ASSESS BIOMARKERS (ECBS AND BRAIN-DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR [BDNF]) AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS AFTER A MEDITATION RETREAT. METHODS: THIS WAS AN OBSERVATIONAL PILOT STUDY OF ADULTS BEFORE AND AFTER THE 4-DAY ISHA YOGA BHAVA SPANDANA PROGRAM RETREAT. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED ONLINE SURVEYS (BEFORE AND AFTER RETREAT, AND 1 MONTH LATER) TO ASSESS ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, FOCUS, WELL-BEING, AND HAPPINESS THROUGH VALIDATED PSYCHOLOGICAL SCALES. VOLUNTARY BLOOD SAMPLING FOR BIOMARKER STUDIES WAS DONE BEFORE AND WITHIN A DAY AFTER THE RETREAT. THE BIOMARKERS ANANDAMIDE, 2-ARACHIDONOYLGLYCEROL (2-AG), 1-ARACHIDONOYLGLYCEROL (1-AG), DOCOSATETRAENOYLETHANOLAMIDE (DEA), OLEOYLETHANOLAMIDE (OLA), AND BDNF WERE EVALUATED. PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SCALES, AS WELL AS CHANGES IN ECBS AND BDNF. RESULTS: DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SCORES DECREASED WHILE FOCUS, HAPPINESS, AND POSITIVE WELL-BEING SCORES INCREASED IMMEDIATELY AFTER RETREAT FROM THEIR BASELINE VALUES (P < 0.001). ALL IMPROVEMENTS WERE SUSTAINED 1 MONTH AFTER BSP. ALL MAJOR ECBS INCLUDING ANANDAMIDE, 2-AG, 1-AG, DEA, AND BDNF INCREASED AFTER MEDITATION BY > 70% (P < 0.001). INCREASES OF >/=20% IN ANANDAMIDE, 2-AG, 1-AG, AND TOTAL AG LEVELS AFTER MEDITATION FROM THE BASELINE HAD WEAK CORRELATIONS WITH CHANGES IN HAPPINESS AND WELL-BEING. CONCLUSIONS: A SHORT MEDITATION EXPERIENCE IMPROVED FOCUS, HAPPINESS, AND POSITIVE WELL-BEING AND REDUCED DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY IN PARTICIPANTS FOR AT LEAST 1 MONTH. PARTICIPANTS HAD INCREASED BLOOD ECBS AND BDNF, SUGGESTING A ROLE FOR THESE BIOMARKERS IN THE UNDERLYING MECHANISM OF MEDITATION. MEDITATION IS A SIMPLE, ORGANIC, AND EFFECTIVE WAY TO IMPROVE WELL-BEING AND REDUCE DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY.	2020	

9 1536  19 KETAMINE, TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION, AND DEPRESSION SPECIFIC YOGA AND MINDFULNESS BASED COGNITIVE THERAPY IN MANAGEMENT OF TREATMENT RESISTANT DEPRESSION: REVIEW AND SOME DATA ON EFFICACY. DEPRESSION AFFECTS ABOUT 121 MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE AND PREVALENCE OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD) IN US ADULTS IS 6.4%. TREATMENT RESISTANT DEPRESSION (TRD) ACCOUNTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 12-20% OF ALL DEPRESSION PATIENTS AND COSTS $29-$48 BILLION ANNUALLY. KETAMINE AND REPETITIVE TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION (RTMS) HAVE USEFUL ROLES IN TRD, BUT THEIR UTILITY IN LONG TERM IS UNKNOWN. AS PER THE LATEST LITERATURE, THE INTERVENTIONS USING YOGA AND MEDITATION INCLUDING THE MINDFULNESS BASED COGNITIVE THERAPY (MBCT) HAVE BEEN USEFUL IN TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION AND RELAPSE PREVENTION. WE PRESENT A REVIEW OF RTMS, KETAMINE, AND MBCT AND ALSO REPORT EFFICACY OF A DEPRESSION SPECIFIC, INNOVATIVE, AND TRANSLATIONAL MODEL OF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS BASED COGNITIVE THERAPY (DEPS Y-MBCT), DEVELOPED BY THE FIRST AUTHOR. DEPS Y-MBCT AS AN ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT SUCCESSFULLY AMELIORATED TRD SYMPTOMS IN 27/32 PATIENTS IN AN OPEN LABEL PILOT TRIAL IN TRD PATIENTS. CONSIDERING THE LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING TREATMENT OPTIONS, INCLUDING THOSE OF KETAMINE AND RTMS WHEN USED AS THE SOLE MODALITY OF TREATMENT, WE SUGGEST A "TIERED APPROACH FOR TRD" BY COMBINING KETAMINE AND RTMS (ALONE OR ALONG WITH ANTIDEPRESSANTS) FOR RAPID REMISSION OF ACUTE DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AND TO USE DEPS Y-MBCT FOR MAINTAINING REMISSION AND PREVENTING RELAPSE.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
10  956  28 EFFECTS OF A PRENATAL YOGA PROGRAMME ON THE DISCOMFORTS OF PREGNANCY AND MATERNAL CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY IN TAIWAN. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE A YOGA PROGRAMME PROVIDED TO PRIMIGRAVIDAS IN THE THIRD TRIMESTER OF PREGNANCY WITH THE AIM OF DECREASING THE DISCOMFORTS ASSOCIATED WITH PREGNANCY AND INCREASING CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY. DESIGN: NON-RANDOMISED CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTAL STUDY. SETTING: A HOSPITAL IN NORTHERN TAIWAN. PARTICIPANTS: THE TARGET POPULATION WAS PRIMIGRAVIDAS AT 26-28 WEEKS OF GESTATION (NO HIGH-RISK PREGNANCIES) WHO HAD NOT ENGAGED IN REGULAR EXERCISE OR YOGA FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR. THE STUDY INCLUDED 88 INDIVIDUALS; 43 IN THE CONTROL GROUP AND 45 IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WHO TOOK PART IN THE PRENATAL YOGA PROGRAMME. INTERVENTION: THE DURATION OF THE PRENATAL YOGA PROGRAMME WAS 12-14 WEEKS, WITH AT LEAST THREE SESSIONS PER WEEK. EACH WORKOUT LASTED FOR 30 MINUTES. MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: WOMEN WHO TOOK PART IN THE PRENATAL YOGA PROGRAMME REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER PREGNANCY DISCOMFORTS THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (38.28 VS 43.26, Z=-2.58, P=0.01) AT 38-40 WEEKS OF GESTATION. THE SUBJECTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE YOGA PROGRAMME EXHIBITED HIGHER OUTCOME AND SELF-EFFICACY EXPECTANCIES DURING THE ACTIVE STAGE OF LABOUR (104.13 VS 83.53, T=3.24, P=0.002; 99.26 VS 77.70, T=3.99, P </= 0.001) AND THE SECOND STAGE OF LABOUR (113.33 VS 88.42, T=3.33, P=0.002; 102.19 VS 79.40, T=3.71, P </= 0.001) COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. KEY CONCLUSIONS: THE PROVISION OF BOOKLETS AND VIDEOS ON YOGA DURING PREGNANCY MAY CONTRIBUTE TO A REDUCTION IN PREGNANCY DISCOMFORTS AND IMPROVED CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: THIS YOGA PROGRAMME PROVIDES HEALTH-CARE PROFESSIONALS WITH AN EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTION.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
11  533  17 COMPARISON OF TWO TAGTEACH ERROR-CORRECTION PROCEDURES TO TEACH BEGINNER YOGA POSES TO ADULTS. TEACHING WITH ACOUSTICAL GUIDANCE INVOLVES AUDITORY FEEDBACK (E.G., A CLICK SOUND WHEN A DESIRED BEHAVIOR OCCURS) AS PART OF A MULTICOMPONENT INTERVENTION KNOWN AS TAGTEACH. TAGTEACH HAS BEEN FOUND TO IMPROVE PERFORMANCE IN SPORT, DANCE, SURGICAL TECHNIQUE, AND WALKING. WE COMPARED THE EFFICACY AND EFFICIENCY OF THE STANDARD TAGTEACH ERROR-CORRECTION PROCEDURE AND A MODIFIED TAGTEACH ERROR-CORRECTION PROCEDURE TO TEACH 4 NOVICE ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS BEGINNER YOGA POSES. BOTH ERROR-CORRECTION PROCEDURES WERE EFFECTIVE FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS; HOWEVER, THE RELATIVE EFFICIENCY OF THESE ERROR-CORRECTION PROCEDURES WAS UNCLEAR. RESULTS ARE DISCUSSED IN TERMS OF LIMITATIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
12  918  29 EFFECTIVENESS OF TRAINING PROGRAM COMBINING CHAKRAYOGA AND MEDITATION. BACKGROUND THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PROGRAM COMBINING CHAKRAYOGA AND MEDITATION ON THE PHYSICAL HEALTH AND DISEASE-RELATED FACTORS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS OF PEOPLE. METHODS NINETY-SEVEN SUBJECTS (32-83 YEARS OLD) WHO HAD FREE FROM PRIOR EXPERIENCES IN MEDITATION PROGRAMS OR CHAKRAYOGA TRAINING COURSES WERE ASSIGNED TO EITHER THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (EXP) (45 SUBJECTS; 13 MALE SUBJECTS AND 32 FEMALE SUBJECTS; AVERAGE AGE OF 60.67 YEARS, SD=11.09 YEARS) OR THE CONTROL GROUP (CONT) OF REMAINING SUBJECTS (52 SUBJECTS; 14 MALE SUBJECTS AND 38 FEMALE SUBJECTS; AVERAGE AGE OF 61.58 YEARS, SD=9.70 YEARS). SUBJECTS IN THE EXP PARTICIPATED IN THE CHAKRAYOGA MEDITATION PROGRAM FOR TWICE A WEEK FOR 2 H DURING 6 WEEKS IN EACH SESSION CONSISTED OF 1 H OF CHAKRAYOGA AND 1 H OF MEDITATION. THE MEASUREMENTS IN THIS STUDY INCLUDED THE MINDFULNESS, STRESS RESPONSE, SUBJECTIVE QUALITY OF LIFE, MEDICAL SYMPTOM CHECKLIST, DIFFICULTY IN EMOTIONAL REGULATION AND OBJECTIVE OF LIFE AND SENSE OF CONTROL. RESULTS RESULTS REVEALED THAT PARTICIPANTS IN THE EXP REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE RELIEF OF MINDFULNESS, STRESS RESPONSE, SUBJECTIVE QUALITY OF LIFE AND MEDICAL SYMPTOM CHECKLIST THAN THOSE IN THE CONT. CONCLUSIONS THESE FINDINGS PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT THE CHAKRAYOGA MEDITATION PROGRAM CAN HELP RELIEVE THE PHYSICAL HEALTH AND DISEASE-RELATED FACTORS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
13 1517  32 IS YOGA ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED SLEEP AMONGST BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS? BACKGROUND: BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS MAY EXPERIENCE SLEEP DISTURBANCES THAT CAN AFFECT THEIR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WELL-BEING. WE SOUGHT TO DETERMINE THE ASSOCIATION, IF ANY, BETWEEN YOGA AND SLEEP AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS IN A POPULATION-BASED COHORT. METHODS: THE NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY IS DESIGNED TO BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE US CIVILIAN NON-INSTITUTIONALIZED POPULATION. WE EVALUATED BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS IN THE 2017 COHORT TO DETERMINE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN YOGA AND SELF-REPORTED QUALITY OF SLEEP. RESULTS: OF THE 25,905 PEOPLE SURVEYED, REPRESENTING 238,738,039 IN THE POPULATION, 1.59% REPORTED A PREVIOUS HISTORY OF BREAST CANCER. BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WERE LESS LIKELY TO REPORT HAVING PRACTICED YOGA IN THE PRECEDING 12 MONTHS, COMPARED TO THOSE WITHOUT A HISTORY OF BREAST CANCER (9.98% VS 13.78%, P = .011). IN ADDITION, THEY WERE MORE LIKELY TO REPORT HAVING HAD TROUBLE FALLING ASLEEP (44.64% VS 36.32%, P = .002), STAYING ASLEEP (53.72% VS 39.43%, P < .001), AND USING SLEEP MEDICATION ON AT LEAST 1 DAY WITHIN THE PREVIOUS WEEK (23.80% VS 13.49%, P < .001) THAN THOSE WITHOUT BREAST CANCER. AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN DIFFICULTY FALLING ASLEEP (39.16% VS 44.98%, P = .482), DIFFICULTY STAYING ASLEEP (61.17% VS 52.70%, P = .305), AND NEEDING SLEEP MEDICATION (19.03% VS 24.53%, P = .395) BETWEEN THOSE WHO PRACTICED YOGA AND THOSE WHO DID NOT. CONTROLLING FOR SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS, THERE REMAINED NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN YOGA AND DIFFICULTY FALLING OR STAYING ASLEEP AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. CONCLUSION: THERE IS NO DIRECT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN YOGA AND SLEEP QUALITY IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
14 2771  17 YOGA REDUCES SYMPTOMS OF DISTRESS IN TSUNAMI SURVIVORS IN THE ANDAMAN ISLANDS. A MONTH AFTER THE DECEMBER 2004 TSUNAMI THE EFFECT OF A 1 WEEK YOGA PROGRAM WAS EVALUATED ON SELF RATED FEAR, ANXIETY, SADNESS AND DISTURBED SLEEP IN 47 SURVIVORS IN THE ANDAMAN ISLANDS. POLYGRAPH RECORDINGS OF THE HEART RATE, BREATH RATE AND SKIN RESISTANCE WERE ALSO MADE. AMONG THE 47 PEOPLE, 31 WERE SETTLERS FROM THE MAINLAND (I.E. INDIA, ML GROUP) AND 16 WERE ENDOGENOUS PEOPLE (EP GROUP). THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN SELF RATED FEAR, ANXIETY, SADNESS AND DISTURBED SLEEP IN BOTH GROUPS, AND IN THE HEART AND BREATH RATE IN THE ML GROUP, AND IN THE BREATH RATE ALONE IN THE EP GROUP, FOLLOWING YOGA (P < 0.05, T-TEST). THIS SUGGESTS THAT YOGA PRACTICE MAY BE USEFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF STRESS FOLLOWING A NATURAL DISASTER IN PEOPLE WITH WIDELY DIFFERING SOCIAL, CULTURAL AND SPIRITUAL BELIEFS.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
15   32  29 5-HTTLPR AND MTHFR 677C>T POLYMORPHISMS AND RESPONSE TO YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION IN MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER: A RANDOMIZED ACTIVE-CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE SUGGESTING THAT BOTH GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS MODULATE TREATMENT OUTCOME IN, A HIGHLY HETEROGENEOUS, MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD). 5-HTTLPR VARIANT OF THE SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER GENE (SLC6A4) AND MTHFR 677C>T POLYMORPHISMS HAVE BEEN LINKED TO THE PATHOGENESIS OF MDD, AND ANTIDEPRESSANT TREATMENT RESPONSE. THE EVIDENCE IS LACKING ON THE CLINICAL UTILITY OF YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH MDD WHO HAVE 5-HTTLPR AND MTHFR 677C>T POLYMORPHISMS AND LESS LIKELY TO RESPOND TO MEDICATIONS (SSRIS). AIMS: WE AIMED TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF YBLI IN THOSE WHO HAVE SUSCEPTIBLE 5-HTTLPR AND MTHFR 677C>T POLYMORPHISMS AND ARE LESS LIKELY TO DRUG THERAPY WITH SSRIS. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: IN A 12 WEEK RANDOMIZED ACTIVE-CONTROLLED TRIAL, MDD PATIENTS (N = 178) WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE YBLI OR DRUG THERAPY. METHODS: GENOTYPING WAS CONDUCTED USING PCR-BASED METHODS. THE CLINICAL REMISSION WAS DEFINED AS BDI-II SCORE </= 9. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: AN INTENT-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED, AND THE ASSOCIATION OF GENOTYPE WITH TREATMENT REMISSION CONSISTED OF THE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL. A P VALUE OF <0.05 WAS CONSIDERED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. RESULTS: MULTIVARIATE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELS FOR REMISSION INCLUDING EITHER 5-HTTLPR OR MTHFR 677C>T GENOTYPES SHOWED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT ODDS OF REMISSION IN YOGA ARM VS. DRUG ARM. NEITHER 5-HTTLPR NOR MTHFR 677C>T GENOTYPE SHOWED ANY INFLUENCE ON REMISSION TO YBLI (P = 0.73 AND P = 0.64, RESPECTIVELY). FURTHER ANALYSIS SHOWED CHILDHOOD ADVERSITY INTERACT WITH 5-HTTLPR AND MTHFR 677C>T POLYMORPHISMS TO DECREASE TREATMENT RESPONSE IN DRUG TREATMENT ARM, BUT NOT IN YOGA ARM. CONCLUSIONS: YBLI PROVIDES MDD REMISSION IN THOSE WHO HAVE SUSCEPTIBLE 5-HTTLPR AND MTHFR 677C>T POLYMORPHISMS AND ARE RESISTANT TO SSRIS TREATMENT. YBLI MAY BE THERAPEUTIC FOR MDD INDEPENDENT OF HETEROGENEITY IN ITS ETIOPATHOGENESIS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
16 1657  24 MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN AND INTEREST IN MEDITATION AND YOGA IN HOME HEALTH AIDES: EVIDENCE FROM THE HOME HEALTH OCCUPATIONS MUSCULOSKELETAL EXAMINATIONS (HHOME) STUDY. HOME HEALTHCARE AIDES (HHAS) ARE A GROWING U.S. WORKFORCE HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO WORKPLACE STRESSORS AND MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN. IN THE PRESENT STUDY WE: 1) EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATION OF MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN TO LIFE SATISFACTION AND EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION; AND 2) CHARACTERIZE INTEREST IN MEDITATION AND YOGA IN A SAMPLE OF HHAS. A NONPROBABILISTIC SAMPLE OF HHAS EMPLOYED AT HOME HEALTHCARE AGENCIES IN FLORIDA, MASSACHUSETTS, AND OREGON (N = 285 TOTAL) COMPLETED A SELF-ADMINISTERED QUESTIONNAIRE WITH STANDARD SURVEY MEASURES ON MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN LOCATION, DURATION, AND SEVERITY; LIFE SATISFACTION; EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION; AND INTEREST IN MEDITATION TECHNIQUES AND YOGA. AMONG HHAS RESPONDING, 48.4% REPORTED PAIN IN THE LAST 7 DAYS AND 46.6% REPORTED PAIN IN THE LAST 3 MONTHS. HOME HEALTHCARE AIDES WHO REPORTED CURRENT PAIN AND CHRONIC PAIN HAD A SIGNIFICANT (P < .05) DECREASE IN SATISFACTION WITH LIFE SCORE AND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION SCORE. THE MAJORITY OF HHAS REPORTED AN INTEREST IN LEARNING ABOUT THE BENEFITS (65.6%) AND PRACTICE (66.4%) OF MEDITATION AND A WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN A YOGA CLASS (59.2%) OR STRESS MANAGEMENT MEETING (59.1%). THE HHAS REPORTED BOTH ACUTE AND CHRONIC MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN THAT WAS CORRELATED WITH LOWER LIFE SATISFACTION AND GREATER EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION. MORE EFFORTS ARE NEEDED TO REDUCE THE SOURCES OF INJURY AND EMOTIONAL EXHAUSTION.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
17 1360  25 IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF YOGA BREATHING WITH INTERMITTENT BREATH HOLDING ON RESPONSE INHIBITION AMONG HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS. BACKGROUND: THERE IS VERY LITTLE EVIDENCE AVAILABLE ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA-BASED BREATHING PRACTICES ON RESPONSE INHIBITION. THE CURRENT STUDY USED STOP-SIGNAL PARADIGM TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA BREATHING WITH INTERMITTENT BREATH HOLDING (YBH) ON RESPONSE INHIBITION AMONG HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIRTY-SIX HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS (17 MALES + 19 FEMALES), WITH MEAN AGE OF 20.31 +/- 3.48 YEARS FROM A UNIVERSITY, WERE RECRUITED IN A WITHIN-SUBJECT REPEATED MEASURES (RM) DESIGN. THE RECORDINGS FOR STOP SIGNAL TASK WERE PERFORMED ON THREE DIFFERENT DAYS FOR BASELINE, POST-YBH, AND POST YOGIC BREATH AWARENESS (YBA) SESSIONS. STOP-SIGNAL REACTION TIME (SSRT), MEAN REACTION TIME TO GO STIMULI (GO RT), AND THE PROBABILITY OF RESPONDING ON-STOP SIGNAL TRIALS (P [R/S]) WERE ANALYZED FOR 36 VOLUNTEERS USING RM ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE. RESULTS: SSRT REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY IN BOTH YBH (218.33 +/- 38.38) AND YBA (213.15 +/- 37.29) GROUPS WHEN COMPARED TO BASELINE (231.98 +/- 29.54). NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE OBSERVED IN GO RT AND P (R/S). FURTHER, THE CHANGES IN SSRT WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT AMONG YBH AND YBA GROUPS. CONCLUSION: BOTH YBH AND YBA GROUPS WERE FOUND TO ENHANCE RESPONSE INHIBITION IN THE STOP-SIGNAL PARADIGM. YBH COULD BE FURTHER EVALUATED IN CLINICAL SETTINGS FOR CONDITIONS WHERE RESPONSE INHIBITION IS ALTERED.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
18 2327  19 TRENDS IN YOGA, TAI CHI, AND QIGONG USE AMONG US ADULTS, 2002-2017. OBJECTIVES: TO EXAMINE THE CHARACTERISTICS AND TEMPORAL TRENDS OF YOGA, TAI CHI, AND QIGONG (YTQ) USE AMONG US ADULTS. METHODS: USING THE 2002, 2007, 2012, AND 2017 NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEYS, WE EXAMINED THE PREVALENCE, PATTERNS, AND PREDICTING FACTORS OF YTQ USE BY TAYLOR SERIES LINEAR REGRESSION, THE WALD F CHI(2) TEST, AND MULTIVARIABLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELS (N = 116 404). RESULTS: YTQ USE INCREASED FROM 5.8% IN 2002 TO 14.5% IN 2017 (P </= .001). ONLY 6.6% OF YTQ USERS WERE REFERRED BY THEIR MEDICAL DOCTORS, AND APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD DISCLOSED THEIR USE OF YTQ TO MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. REASONS FOR USING YTQ INCLUDED (1) YTQ WAS BENEFICIAL, (2) YTQ FOCUSED ON THE WHOLE PERSON, AND (3) YTQ WAS NATURAL. ACUTE AND CHRONIC PAIN, ARTHRITIS, AND DEPRESSION WERE THE TOP 3 MEDICAL CONDITIONS FOR WHICH PEOPLE USED YTQ THE MOST. CONCLUSIONS: YTQ USE IS INCREASING SUBSTANTIALLY, MAINLY BECAUSE OF ITS NATURAL AND HOLISTIC HEALING APPROACH TOWARD HEALTH AND CHRONIC DISEASES. FUTURE STUDIES AIMING TO EXPLORE HOW TO BEST INTEGRATE YTQ INTO THE CURRENT HEALTH CARE SYSTEM ARE WARRANTED.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
19 1629  28 MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA FOR YOUTH WITH PERSISTENT CONCUSSION: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: WE EXPLORED THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA (MBY) FOR YOUTH WITH PERSISTENT CONCUSSION BY EXAMINING OCCUPATION-BASED AND NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL OUTCOMES. METHOD: IN THIS CASE SERIES DESIGN STUDY, 6 YOUTHS AGES 13-17 YR WITH CONCUSSION SYMPTOMS FOR >4 WK PARTICIPATED IN AN 8-WK MBY INTERVENTION, 1X/WK FOR 45 MIN. PARTICIPATION, SELF-EFFICACY, AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY (24 HR) WERE COLLECTED BEFORE, AFTER, AND 3 MO AFTER THE INTERVENTION. HEART RATE VARIABILITY WAS ALSO MEASURED DURING EACH SESSION. RESULTS: TRENDS OF INCREASED SELF-EFFICACY IN ACADEMIC, SOCIAL, AND EMOTIONAL DOMAINS WERE FOUND AFTER MBY AND MAINTAINED AT 3-MO FOLLOW-UP. TRENDS OF INCREASING HEART RATE VARIABILITY WERE ALSO FOUND PRE- TO POSTINTERVENTION AND WITHIN THE EIGHT MBY SESSIONS. CONCLUSION: PRELIMINARY RESULTS REVEAL POSITIVE TRENDS AFTER A NOVEL, SAFE INTERVENTION FOR YOUTH WITH PERSISTENT CONCUSSION SYMPTOMS AND THE VALUE OF EXPLORING BOTH OCCUPATION-BASED AND NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL MEASURES. FUTURE RESEARCH WITH A LARGER SAMPLE AND CONTROL GROUP IS WARRANTED.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
20 2160  28 THE EFFECTS OF WEIGHT BEARING YOGA TRAINING ON THE BONE RESORPTION MARKERS OF THE POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. THIS STUDY WAS A PRELIMINARY REPORT TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF THE WEIGHT BEARING YOGA TRAINING ON BOTH BONE RESORPTION MARKER AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF THE POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. THE SAMPLES WERE RECRUITED BY THE PURPOSIVE SAMPLING FROM THE FEMALE CHULALONGKORN UNIVERSITY STAFF AGED BETWEEN 50-60 YEARS. THE SUBJECTS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND CONTROL GROUP. THE BASELINE DEMOGRAPHIC DATA, THE BONE RESORPTION MARKER (BETA-CROSSLAPS), THE BONE FORMATION MARKER (P1NP) AND QUALITY OF LIFE (SF-36) DATA WERE COLLECTED. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP ATTENDED THE 12-WEEK WEIGHT-BEARING YOGA TRAINING 3 DAYS A WEEK, 50 MINUTES A DAY WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP LIVED THEIR NORMAL LIVES. AFTER 12TH WEEK, THE DATA COLLECTIONS WERE REPEATED IN BOTH GROUPS. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (19 SUBJECTS, THE MEAN AGE 54.320 YRS) AND THE CONTROL GROUP (14 SUBJECTS, THE MEAN AGE 54.430 YRS) WERE RECRUITED. THE MEAN ULTRASOUND BMD OF BOTH HEELS IN BOTH GROUPS SHOWED NO OSTEOPENIA OR OSTEOPOROSIS. AFTER THE 12-WEEK TRAINING, THE MEAN BONE RESORPTION MARKER (BETA-CROSSLAPS) OF THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP REDUCED FROM 0.464 TO 0.339 NG/ML (-26.939%) WHEREAS THE CONTROL GROUP REDUCED FROM 0.389 TO 0.386 NG/ML (-0.771%). THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE (P < 0.05). THE MEAN OF THE BONE FORMATION MARKERS (PINP) IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP REDUCED FROM 55.393 TO 42.401 NG/ML (-23.454%) AND THE BONE FORMATION MARKERS (PINP) IN THE CONTROL GROUP REDUCED FROM 61.903 TO 44.832 NG/ML (-27.577%). IN THE AREA OF THE LIFE QUALITY MEASUREMENT OF BOTH GROUPS, THE DATA OBTAINED FROM THE MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY SHORT-FORM SURVEY (SF-36) SHOWED THAT THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AT 0.05 LEVELS FOR THE PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING, BODILY PAIN, GENERAL HEALTH, AND VITALITY. THE VARIANCE OF PERCENTAGE CHANGE VALUE OF THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP INCREASED TO +25.299, +16.565, +15.309, AND +21.056. THE VARIANCE OF PERCENTAGE CHANGE VALUE OF THE CONTROL GROUP INCREASED TO +12.946, -1.221, -9.303 AND +2.291. THE WEIGH-BEARING YOGA TRAINING HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON BONE BY SLOWING DOWN BONE RESORPTION WHICH WAS A VERY ESSENTIAL INDICATOR FOR HUMAN HEALTH BECAUSE IT REDUCED THE OSTEOPOROSIS RISKS IN THE POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. ADDITIONALLY, YOGA TRAINING PROMOTED BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE.	2009

1 2113 134 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE DELIVERY AND NEONATAL OUTCOMES IN NULLIPAROUS PREGNANT WOMEN IN IRAN: A CLINICAL TRIAL STUDY. BACKGROUND: YOGA CAN REDUCE THE RISK OF PRETERM DELIVERY, CESAREAN SECTION (CS), AND FETAL DEATH. THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PREGNANCY, DELIVERY, AND NEONATAL OUTCOMES. METHODS: THIS WAS A CLINICAL TRIAL STUDY AND USING THE RANDOM SAMPLING WITHOUT REPLACEMENT 70 PREGNANT WOMEN ENTERED HATHA YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS ACCORDING TO THE COLOR OF THE BALL THEY TOOK FROM A BAG CONTAINING TWO BALLS (BLUE OR RED). THE DATA COLLECTION TOOL WAS A QUESTIONNAIRE PREGNANCY, DELIVERY, AND NEONATAL OUTCOMES. THE INTERVENTION IN THIS STUDY INCLUDED PREGNANCY HATHA YOGA EXERCISES THAT FIRST SESSION OF PREGNANCY YOGA STARTED FROM THE 26TH WEEK AND SAMPLES ATTENDED THE LAST SESSION IN THE 37TH WEEK. THEY EXERCISED YOGA TWICE A WEEK (EACH SESSION LASTING 75 MIN) IN A YOGA SPECIALIZED SPORTS CLUB. THE CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED THE ROUTINE PRENATAL CARE THAT ALL PREGNANT WOMEN RECEIVE. RESULTS: THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT YOGA REDUCED THE INDUCTION OF LABOR, THE EPISIOTOMY RUPTURE, DURATION OF LABOR, ALSO HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON NORMAL BIRTH WEIGHT AND DELIVERY AT THE APPROPRIATE GESTATIONAL AGE. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND APGAR SCORES OF THE INFANTS. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS OF THE PRESENT STUDY SHOWED THAT YOGA CAN IMPROVE THE OUTCOMES OF PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH. THEY CAN BE USED AS PART OF THE CARE PROTOCOL ALONG WITH CHILDBIRTH PREPARATION CLASSES TO REDUCE THE COMPLICATIONS OF PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH.

2 2414  26 YOGA AND MASSAGE THERAPY REDUCE PRENATAL DEPRESSION AND PREMATURITY. EIGHTY-FOUR PRENATALLY DEPRESSED WOMEN WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO YOGA, MASSAGE THERAPY OR STANDARD PRENATAL CARE CONTROL GROUPS TO DETERMINE THE RELATIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND MASSAGE THERAPY ON PRENATAL DEPRESSION AND NEONATAL OUTCOMES. FOLLOWING 12 WEEKS OF TWICE WEEKLY YOGA OR MASSAGE THERAPY SESSIONS (20 MIN EACH) BOTH THERAPY GROUPS VERSUS THE CONTROL GROUP HAD A GREATER DECREASE ON DEPRESSION, ANXIETY AND BACK AND LEG PAIN SCALES AND A GREATER INCREASE ON A RELATIONSHIP SCALE. IN ADDITION, THE YOGA AND MASSAGE THERAPY GROUPS DID NOT DIFFER ON NEONATAL OUTCOMES INCLUDING GESTATIONAL AGE AND BIRTHWEIGHT, AND THOSE GROUPS, IN TURN, HAD GREATER GESTATIONAL AGE AND BIRTHWEIGHT THAN THE CONTROL GROUP.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
3 2223  43 THE IMPACT OF PRENATAL YOGA ON EXERCISE ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIOR: TEACHABLE MOMENTS FROM A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: PREGNANCY SERVES AS AN OPPORTUNE TIME FOR "TEACHABLE MOMENTS" TO ELICIT POSITIVE BEHAVIOR CHANGE. WE EVALUATED CHANGE IN EXERCISE PERCEPTION, BEHAVIOR AND GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN IN PARTICIPANTS ENGAGED IN A ONE-HOUR EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE. METHODS: WOMEN BETWEEN 28 0/7 TO 36 6/7 WEEKS WITH NO PRIOR YOGA EXPERIENCE CARRYING A NON-ANOMALOUS SINGLETON FETUS PARTICIPATED IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL ON PRENATAL YOGA. THE YOGA GROUP ENGAGED IN A ONE-HOUR YOGA CLASS; THE ATTENTION CONTROL EDUCATIONAL GROUP, IN A ONE-HOUR PRESENTATION ON EXERCISE, NUTRITION AND OBESITY IN PREGNANCY. MATERNAL PERCEPTION OF YOGA, EXERCISE EFFECTS AND CURRENT HEALTH STATUS WAS CONDUCTED BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION. GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN (GWG) AND BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) WERE ASSESSED. A POSTPARTUM SURVEY WAS PERFORMED TO DETERMINE SELF-REPORTED BEHAVIORAL CHANGES DURING AND AFTER PREGNANCY. RESULTS: OVER 6 MONTHS, 52 WOMEN WERE RANDOMIZED AND 46 (88%) COMPLETED THE STUDY. WOMEN REPORTED A MORE POSITIVE ATTITUDE TOWARDS EXERCISE AND YOGA AFTER THE YOGA INTERVENTION. TOTAL GWG WAS SIMILAR (YOGA 32.9 VERSUS EDUCATION 32.8 POUNDS, P = 0.98). STRATIFIED BY PRE-PREGNANCY BMI, 13% GAINED WITHIN AND 61% GAINED ABOVE THE INSTITUTE OF MEDICINE GUIDELINES IN EACH GROUP. OF 29 INACTIVE WOMEN PRIOR TO THE INTERVENTION, 60% OF THE YOGA GROUP AND 75% OF THE EDUCATION GROUP BEGAN PRENATAL EXERCISES AFTER THE INTERVENTION AND 50% OF EACH GROUP CONTINUED TO EXERCISE AFTER DELIVERY. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS. CONCLUSION: A ONE-TIME, ONE-HOUR INTERVENTION TEACHING A NEW EXERCISE OR EDUCATING WOMEN DURING PREGNANCY CAN POSITIVELY IMPACT PREGNANCY BEHAVIORS AND PERCEPTION WITH THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE MATERNAL AND NEONATAL OUTCOMES.

4 2524  37 YOGA DURING PREGNANCY: EFFECTS ON MATERNAL COMFORT, LABOR PAIN AND BIRTH OUTCOMES. THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA PROGRAM DURING PREGNANCY, ON MATERNAL COMFORT, LABOR PAIN, AND BIRTH OUTCOMES. A RANDOMIZED TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED USING 74-PRIMIGRAVID THAI WOMEN WHO WERE EQUALLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS (EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL). THE YOGA PROGRAM INVOLVED SIX, 1-H SESSIONS AT PRESCRIBED WEEKS OF GESTATION. A VARIETY OF INSTRUMENTS WERE USED TO ASSESS MATERNAL COMFORT, LABOR PAIN AND BIRTH OUTCOMES. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS FOUND TO HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF MATERNAL COMFORT DURING LABOR AND 2H POST-LABOR, AND EXPERIENCED LESS SUBJECT EVALUATED LABOR PAIN THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. IN EACH GROUP, PAIN INCREASED AND MATERNAL COMFORT DECREASED AS LABOR PROGRESSED. NO DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND, BETWEEN THE GROUPS, REGARDING PETHIDINE USAGE, LABOR AUGMENTATION OR NEWBORN APGAR SCORES AT 1 AND 5 MIN. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS FOUND TO HAVE A SHORTER DURATION OF THE FIRST STAGE OF LABOR, AS WELL AS THE TOTAL TIME OF LABOR.	2008

6 1791  22 PRENATAL YOGA AND EXCESSIVE GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN: A REVIEW OF EVIDENCE AND POTENTIAL MECHANISMS. PURPOSE: TO REVIEW THE EVIDENCE OF THE POTENTIAL MECHANISMS (BEHAVIORAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL/EMOTIONAL, AND PHYSICAL FACTORS) OF PRENATAL YOGA FOR PREVENTING EXCESSIVE GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN (GWG) IN PREGNANT WOMEN TO GUIDE FUTURE RESEARCH. MAIN BODY: PRENATAL YOGA IS A COMMON FORM OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY DURING PREGNANCY AND INCLUDES A COMBINATION OF PHYSICAL POSTURES, BREATH CONTROL AND MEDITATION. THIS REVIEW THEORIZES HOW COMBINING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (I.E., PRENATAL YOGA POSTURES) WITH THE ADD-ONS BROUGHT BY PRENATAL YOGA (E.G., BREATH CONTROL, MEDITATION), MIGHT PROVIDE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE AND EFFECTIVE STRATEGY TO PREVENT EXCESSIVE GWG THAN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ALONE. THIS ARTICLE A) SUMMARIZES THE LITERATURE ON POTENTIAL MECHANISMS OF PRENATAL YOGA TO PREVENT EXCESSIVE GWG SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING ON BEHAVIORAL (DIET, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND SLEEP), PSYCHOLOGICAL/EMOTIONAL (SELF-AWARENESS, EMOTION REGULATION, STRESS, MOOD, MINDFULNESS) AND PHYSICAL FACTORS (PREGNANCY DISCOMFORTS), B) HIGHLIGHTS LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT STUDIES, AND C) PROVIDES SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. THE FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE THERE IS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE THAT PRENATAL YOGA IMPROVES BEHAVIORAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL/EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL FACTORS IN PREGNANT WOMEN AND MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED. THOUGH THESE FACTORS HAVE BEEN MORE STRONGLY LINKED TO IMPROVED WEIGHT OUTCOMES IN NON-PREGNANT POPULATIONS, FURTHER TESTING IN PREGNANT WOMEN IS NECESSARY TO DRAW DEFINITIVE CONCLUSIONS FOR THE EFFICACY OF PRENATAL YOGA TO PREVENT EXCESSIVE GWG. CONCLUSION: EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES ARE NEEDED TO PREVENT EXCESSIVE GWG TO ENCOURAGE OPTIMAL MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH OUTCOMES. MORE RESEARCH IS WARRANTED TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF PRENATAL YOGA ON WEIGHT OUTCOMES DURING PREGNANCY AND DESIGN STUDIES TO TEST THE PROPOSED MECHANISMS DISCUSSED IN THIS REVIEW.	2022

8 2088  43 THE EFFECT OF PRACTICING YOGA DURING PREGNANCY ON LABOR STAGES LENGTH, ANXIETY AND PAIN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: ANXIETY AND FEAR OF LABOR PAIN HAS LED TO ELEVATED CESAREAN SECTION RATE IN SOME COUNTRIES. THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA IN PREGNANCY ON ANXIETY, LABOR PAIN AND LENGTH OF LABOR STAGES. METHODS: THIS CLINICAL TRIAL STUDY WAS PERFORMED ON 84 NULLIPAROUS WOMEN WHO WERE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OLD AND WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS OF YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS. PREGNANCY YOGA PROGRAM CONSISTING OF 6 60-MIN TRAINING SESSIONS WAS STARTED EVERY 2 WEEKS FROM WEEK 26 OF PREGNANCY AND CONTINUED UNTIL 37 WEEKS OF GESTATION. ANXIETY SEVERITY AT MATERNAL ADMISSION TO LABOR WAS MEASURED BY THE SPIELBERGERS STATE-TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY, AND LABOR PAIN WAS MEASURED BY VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS) AT DILATATION (4-5 CM) AND 2 H AFTER THE FIRST MEASUREMENT. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING CHI-SQUARE AND T-TEST. RESULTS: INTERVENTION GROUP REPORTED LESS PAIN AT DILATATION (4-5 CM) (P=0.001) AND 2 H AFTER THE FIRST MEASUREMENT (P=0.001) THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. STAT ANXIETY WAS ALSO LOWER IN INTERVENTION GROUP THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (P=0.003) AT THE ENTRANCE TO LABOR ROOM. SUBJECTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP REQUIRED MORE INDUCTION COMPARED TO INTERVENTION GROUP (P=0.003). WOMEN IN INTERVENTION GROUP EXPERIENCED SHORTER DURATION OF THE FIRST PHASE OF THE LABOR THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (P=0.002). ALSO, THE TOTAL DURATION OF TWO STAGES OF LABOR WAS SHORTER IN INTERVENTION GROUP THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: PRACTICING YOGA DURING PREGNANCY MAY REDUCE WOMEN'S ANXIETY DURING LABOR; SHORTEN LABOR STAGES, AND LOWER LABOR PAIN.	2020

DATA ANALYSIS USING THE WILCOXON TEST (P<0.05). RESULTS: STATISTICAL TEST RESULTS SHOWED THAT IN THE CONTROL GROUP (P-VALUE 0.001<0.05) AND INTERVENTION (P-VALUE 0.001<0.05), THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN SLEEP QUALITY BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION WAS GIVEN. CONCLUSION: PRENATAL YOGA EXERCISES IMPROVE THE SLEEP QUALITY OF THIRD-TRIMESTER PREGNANT WOMEN.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
10 2231  32 THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON FEAR OF CHILDBIRTH AND CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY AMONG THIRD TRIMESTER PREGNANTS. BACKGROUND: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICE ON FEAR OF CHILDBIRTH AND CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS STUDY WAS PERFORMED IN A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL MODEL WITH PRETEST AND POST-TEST CONTROL GROUPS. THE PARTICIPANTS OF THE STUDY WERE WOMEN WHO APPLIED TO A PREGNANCY EDUCATION CLASS AT A HOSPITAL. NINETY WOMEN PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY. THE DATA USED IN THE STUDY WERE COLLECTED USING THE INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION FORM, THE WIJMA DELIVERY EXPECTATION/EXPERIENCE SCALE (VERSION A), AND THE CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY SCALE. RESULTS: AFTER PARTICIPATING IN YOGA PRACTICE, THE PREGNANT WOMEN IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP EXHIBITED DECREASED FEAR OF CHILDBIRTH AND INCREASED CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY (P < .05). ON THE OTHER HAND, THE PREGNANT WOMEN IN THE CONTROL GROUP DISPLAYED INCREASED FEAR OF CHILDBIRTH AND DECREASED CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY (P < .05). CONCLUSION: BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY, YOGA PRACTICE REDUCES FEAR OF CHILDBIRTH AND SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
11  150  23 A QUALITATIVE INVESTIGATION OF A PRENATAL YOGA INTERVENTION TO PREVENT EXCESSIVE GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN: A THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF INTERVIEWS. PURPOSE: TO DESCRIBE PREGNANT WOMEN'S EXPERIENCES AND PERCEIVED FACILITATORS/BARRIERS OF A PRENATAL YOGA INTERVENTION TO PREVENT EXCESSIVE GESTATIONAL WEIGHT GAIN (EGWG). METHODS: PREGNANT WOMEN (N = 13) WERE INTERVIEWED AFTER PARTICIPATION IN A 12-WEEK PRENATAL YOGA INTERVENTION TO PREVENT EGWG. INTERVIEWS WERE SUMMARIZED USING THEMATIC ANALYSIS. RESULTS: TWELVE THEMES WERE IDENTIFIED AND ORGANIZED INTO FOUR CATEGORIES: 1) EXPERIENCES OF PRENATAL YOGA (POSITIVE EXPERIENCE/ENJOYMENT, PAIN RELIEF, CONNECTING TO BODY), 2) PRENATAL YOGA AND WEIGHT (INCREASED MINDFULNESS/SELF-AWARENESS, INCREASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, WEIGHT MANAGEMENT), 3) BARRIERS TO PRENATAL YOGA (PHYSICAL BODY, COMMUTE/TRAFFIC, SCHEDULE), AND 4) FACILITATORS OF PRENATAL YOGA (HEALTHY PREGNANCY, SUPPORT FROM OTHER PREGNANT WOMEN, THE FEELING FROM PRENATAL YOGA). CONCLUSION: PRENATAL YOGA MAY RELIEVE PAIN AND HELP WOMEN BE MORE CONNECTED TO THEIR BODIES. PRENATAL YOGA MAY ALSO HELP WOMEN BECOME MORE AWARE OF THEIR HEALTH BEHAVIORS AND INCREASES THEIR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY WHICH MAY HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR REDUCING EGWG.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
12    6  32 "I JUST START CRYING FOR NO REASON": THE EXPERIENCE OF STRESS AND DEPRESSION IN PREGNANT, URBAN, AFRICAN-AMERICAN ADOLESCENTS AND THEIR PERCEPTION OF YOGA AS A MANAGEMENT STRATEGY. PURPOSE: PERINATAL HEALTH DISPARITIES ARE OF PARTICULAR CONCERN WITH PREGNANT, URBAN, AFRICAN-AMERICAN (AA) ADOLESCENTS, WHO HAVE HIGH RATES OF STRESS AND DEPRESSION DURING PREGNANCY, HIGHER RATES OF ADVERSE PREGNANCY AND NEONATAL OUTCOMES, AND MANY BARRIERS TO EFFECTIVE TREATMENT. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE PREGNANT, URBAN, AA TEENAGERS' EXPERIENCE OF STRESS AND DEPRESSION AND EXAMINE THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF ADJUNCTIVE NONPHARMACOLOGIC MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES, SUCH AS YOGA. METHODS: THIS COMMUNITY-BASED, QUALITATIVE STUDY USED NONTHERAPEUTIC FOCUS GROUPS TO ALLOW FOR EXPLORATION OF ATTITUDES, CONCERNS, BELIEFS, AND VALUES REGARDING STRESS AND DEPRESSION IN PREGNANCY AND NONPHARMACOLOGIC MANAGEMENT APPROACHES, SUCH AS MIND-BODY THERAPIES AND OTHER PRENATAL ACTIVITIES. FINDINGS: THE SAMPLE CONSISTED OF PREGNANT, AA, LOW-INCOME ADOLESCENTS (N=17) WHO RESIDED IN A LARGE URBAN AREA IN THE UNITED STATES. THE THEMES THAT AROSE IN THE FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS WERE THAT 1) STRESS AND DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS ARE PERVASIVE IN DAILY LIFE, 2) PARTICIPANTS FELT A GENERALIZED SENSE OF ISOLATION, 3) STRESS/DEPRESSION MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES SHOULD BE GROUP BASED, INTERACTIVE, AND FOCUSED ON THE SPECIFIC NEEDS OF TEENAGERS, AND 4) YOGA IS AN APPEALING STRESS MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUE TO THIS POPULATION. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT PREGNANT, URBAN, ADOLESCENTS ARE HIGHLY STRESSED; THEY INTERPRET DEPRESSION-LIKE SYMPTOMS TO BE SIGNS OF STRESS; THEY DESIRE GROUP-BASED, INTERACTIVE ACTIVITIES; AND THEY ARE INTERESTED IN YOGA CLASSES FOR STRESS/DEPRESSION MANAGEMENT AND RELATIONSHIP BUILDING. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND RESEARCHERS FOCUS ON THESE NEEDS, PARTICULARLY WHEN DESIGNING PREVENTION AND INTERVENTION STRATEGIES.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
13  956  34 EFFECTS OF A PRENATAL YOGA PROGRAMME ON THE DISCOMFORTS OF PREGNANCY AND MATERNAL CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY IN TAIWAN. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE A YOGA PROGRAMME PROVIDED TO PRIMIGRAVIDAS IN THE THIRD TRIMESTER OF PREGNANCY WITH THE AIM OF DECREASING THE DISCOMFORTS ASSOCIATED WITH PREGNANCY AND INCREASING CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY. DESIGN: NON-RANDOMISED CONTROLLED EXPERIMENTAL STUDY. SETTING: A HOSPITAL IN NORTHERN TAIWAN. PARTICIPANTS: THE TARGET POPULATION WAS PRIMIGRAVIDAS AT 26-28 WEEKS OF GESTATION (NO HIGH-RISK PREGNANCIES) WHO HAD NOT ENGAGED IN REGULAR EXERCISE OR YOGA FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR. THE STUDY INCLUDED 88 INDIVIDUALS; 43 IN THE CONTROL GROUP AND 45 IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WHO TOOK PART IN THE PRENATAL YOGA PROGRAMME. INTERVENTION: THE DURATION OF THE PRENATAL YOGA PROGRAMME WAS 12-14 WEEKS, WITH AT LEAST THREE SESSIONS PER WEEK. EACH WORKOUT LASTED FOR 30 MINUTES. MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS: WOMEN WHO TOOK PART IN THE PRENATAL YOGA PROGRAMME REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER PREGNANCY DISCOMFORTS THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (38.28 VS 43.26, Z=-2.58, P=0.01) AT 38-40 WEEKS OF GESTATION. THE SUBJECTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE YOGA PROGRAMME EXHIBITED HIGHER OUTCOME AND SELF-EFFICACY EXPECTANCIES DURING THE ACTIVE STAGE OF LABOUR (104.13 VS 83.53, T=3.24, P=0.002; 99.26 VS 77.70, T=3.99, P </= 0.001) AND THE SECOND STAGE OF LABOUR (113.33 VS 88.42, T=3.33, P=0.002; 102.19 VS 79.40, T=3.71, P </= 0.001) COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. KEY CONCLUSIONS: THE PROVISION OF BOOKLETS AND VIDEOS ON YOGA DURING PREGNANCY MAY CONTRIBUTE TO A REDUCTION IN PREGNANCY DISCOMFORTS AND IMPROVED CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: THIS YOGA PROGRAMME PROVIDES HEALTH-CARE PROFESSIONALS WITH AN EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTION.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
14 2169  43 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN PREVENTION OF PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS IN HIGH-RISK PREGNANCIES: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: WHILE PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA IN NORMAL PREGNANCIES, THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN PREVENTION OF PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS IN HIGH-RISK PREGNANCIES FOR THE FIRST TIME. METHODS: 68 HIGH-RISK PREGNANT WOMEN WERE RECRUITED FROM TWO MATERNITY HOSPITALS IN BENGALURU, INDIA AND WERE RANDOMIZED INTO YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS. THE YOGA GROUP (N=30) RECEIVED STANDARD CARE PLUS ONE-HOUR YOGA SESSIONS, THREE TIMES A WEEK, FROM THE 12TH TO THE 28TH WEEK OF GESTATION. THE CONTROL GROUP (N=38) RECEIVED STANDARD CARE PLUS CONVENTIONAL ANTENATAL EXERCISES (WALKING) DURING THE SAME PERIOD. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER PREGNANCY INDUCED HYPERTENSION (PIH), PREECLAMPSIA, GESTATIONAL DIABETES (GDM) AND INTRAUTERINE GROWTH RESTRICTION (IUGR) CASES WERE OBSERVED IN THE YOGA GROUP (P=0.018, 0.042, 0.049, 0.05 RESPECTIVELY). SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER SMALL FOR GESTATIONAL AGE (SGA) BABIES AND NEWBORNS WITH LOW APGAR SCORES (P=0.006) WERE BORN IN THE YOGA GROUP (P=0.033). CONCLUSION: THIS FIRST RANDOMIZED STUDY OF YOGA IN HIGH-RISK PREGNANCY HAS SHOWN THAT YOGA CAN POTENTIALLY BE AN EFFECTIVE THERAPY IN REDUCING HYPERTENSIVE RELATED COMPLICATIONS OF PREGNANCY AND IMPROVING FETAL OUTCOMES. ADDITIONAL DATA IS NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE RESULTS AND BETTER EXPLAIN THE MECHANISM OF ACTION OF YOGA IN THIS IMPORTANT AREA.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
15 1135  33 EFFICACY OF YOGA ON PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISCOMFORTS AND DELIVERY OUTCOMES IN CHINESE PRIMIPARAS. BACKGROUD AND PURPOSE: ALMOST EVERY WOMAN EXPERIENCES DISCOMFORTS DURING PREGNANCY. THIS STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA ON PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISCOMFORTS AND DELIVERY OUTCOMES IN CHINESE PRIMIPARAS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED. PARTICIPANTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP (N = 32) RECEIVED ROUTINE PRENATAL CARE, WHEREAS PARTICIPANTS IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 32) RECEIVED ROUTINE PRENATAL CARE AND YOGA EXERCISE THREE TIMES A WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS. OUTCOMES EVALUATED INCLUDED PHYSIOLOGICAL DISCOMFORTS, PRENATAL DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY AND DELIVERY OUTCOMES. INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED. RESULTS: YOGA DECREASED THE SYMPTOMS OF PHYSIOLOGICAL DISCOMFORTS DURING PREGNANCY (F = 6.966, P = 0.010), PROMOTED CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY (F = 11.900, P = 0.001), INCREASED THE RATE OF VAGINAL DELIVERY (CHI(2) = 4.267, P = 0.039), AND SHORTENED THE LENGTH OF THE FIRST (T = -2.612, P = 0.012), SECOND (Z = -3.313, P = 0.001) AND THIRD STAGES OF LABOR (Z = -3.137, P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: YOGA OFFERS BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON PHYSIOLOGICAL DISCOMFORTS, CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY AND DELIVERY OUTCOMES IN CHINESE PRIMIPARAS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
16  183  39 A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL ON THE EFFICACY OF INTEGRATED YOGA ON PREGNANCY OUTCOME. PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL CHANGES OCCUR IN PREGNANCY TO NURTURE THE DEVELOPING FETUS. PREGNANCY-RELATED EXPERIENCE IS UNIQUE TO EVERY WOMAN. PREGNANCY SYMPTOMS AND COMPLICATIONS CAN RANGE FROM MILD TO SEVERE. MANY WOMEN CAN LOWER THEIR RISK BY PERFORMING DIFFERENT THERAPIES. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE PRESENT STUDY TARGETS TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF INTEGRATED YOGA CONSISTING OF (ASANAS AND PRANAYAMA) ON PREGNANCY TO REDUCE THE RISK OF COMPLICATIONS. THIS STUDY IS A PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED SINGLE-BLINDED TRIAL WITH PARALLEL ARMS: THE INTERVENTION ARM RECEIVED SPECIFIC INTEGRATED YOGA THERAPY; THE CONTROL ARM RECEIVED ROUTINE STANDARD CARE FROM 18 TO 22 WEEKS OF GESTATION UNTIL DELIVERY. THE INCIDENCE OF PREECLAMPSIA AND PRETERM DELIVERY WAS LOWER IN THE INTERVENTION ARM. WOMEN IN THE INTERVENTION ARM DELIVERED AT HIGHER GESTATIONAL AGE. APGAR SCORES AND BIRTH WEIGHTS OF NEONATES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN THE INTERVENTION ARM. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA IS A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION DURING PREGNANCY TO REDUCE OR PREVENT PREGNANCY-RELATED COMPLICATIONS. HOWEVER, FURTHER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE FIRMER EVIDENCE REGARDING THE UTILITY AND VALIDITY OF YOGA INTERVENTION DURING PREGNANCY.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
17 1136  40 EFFICACY OF YOGA ON PREGNANCY OUTCOME. OBJECTIVE: TO STUDY THE EFFICACY OF YOGA ON PREGNANCY OUTCOMES. DESIGN AND SETTING: THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE (335) WOMEN ATTENDING THE ANTENATAL CLINIC AT GUNASHEELA SURGICAL AND MATERNITY HOSPITAL IN BANGALORE, INDIA, WERE ENROLLED BETWEEN 18 AND 20 WEEKS OF PREGNANCY IN A PROSPECTIVE, MATCHED, OBSERVATIONAL STUDY; 169 WOMEN IN THE YOGA GROUP AND 166 WOMEN IN THE CONTROL GROUP. METHODS: WOMEN WERE MATCHED FOR AGE, PARITY, BODY WEIGHT, AND DOPPLER VELOCIMETRY SCORES OF UMBILICAL AND UTERINE ARTERIES. YOGA PRACTICES, INCLUDING PHYSICAL POSTURES, BREATHING, AND MEDITATION WERE PRACTICED BY THE YOGA GROUP ONE HOUR DAILY, FROM THE DATE OF ENTRY INTO THE STUDY UNTIL DELIVERY. THE CONTROL GROUP WALKED 30 MINUTES TWICE A DAY (STANDARD OBSTETRIC ADVICE) DURING THE STUDY PERIOD. COMPLIANCE IN BOTH GROUPS WAS ENSURED BY FREQUENT TELEPHONE CALLS AND STRICT MAINTENANCE OF AN ACTIVITY DIARY. MAIN OUTCOMES: BIRTH WEIGHT AND GESTATIONAL AGE AT DELIVERY WERE PRIMARY OUTCOMES. RESULTS: THE NUMBER OF BABIES WITH BIRTH WEIGHT > OR = 2500 GRAMS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER (P < 0.01) IN THE YOGA GROUP. PRETERM LABOR WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER (P < 0.0006) IN THE YOGA GROUP. COMPLICATIONS SUCH AS ISOLATED INTRAUTERINE GROWTH RETARDATION (IUGR) (P < 0.003) AND PREGNANCY-INDUCED HYPERTENSION (PIH) WITH ASSOCIATED IUGR (P < 0.025) WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN THE YOGA GROUP. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECTS NOTED IN THE YOGA GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO YOGA DURING PREGNANCY IS SAFE. IT IMPROVES BIRTH WEIGHT, DECREASES PRETERM LABOR, AND DECREASES IUGR EITHER IN ISOLATION OR ASSOCIATED WITH PIH, WITH NO INCREASED COMPLICATIONS.	2005	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
18 1797  53 PRENATAL YOGA: EFFECTS ON ALLEVIATION OF LABOR PAIN AND BIRTH OUTCOMES. BACKGROUND: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT PRENATAL YOGIC EXERCISES ARE EFFECTIVE IN ALLEVIATING LABOR PAIN AND IMPROVING BIRTH OUTCOMES, BY COMPARING PREGNANT WOMEN UNDERTAKING YOGA WITH A CONTROL GROUP. TRIAL DESIGN: SINGLE BLINDED, PARALLEL RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL. METHODS: TWO HUNDRED PRIMIGRAVID WOMEN OF 30 WEEKS OF GESTATION ONWARD WHO MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA (PRIMIGRAVIDA, 20-35 YEARS OF AGE, GESTATIONAL AGE OF 30 WEEKS, NO PRIOR EXPERIENCE OF YOGA) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO STUDY (N = 100) AND CONTROL GROUPS (N = 100) BY USING THE MINIMIZED RANDOMIZATION PROGRAM VERSION 2.01. THE STUDY GROUP RECEIVED THE INTERVENTION IN THE FORM OF INTEGRATED YOGA CONSISTING OF A SERIES OF 30-MIN PRACTICE SESSIONS AT THE 30TH, 32ND, 34TH, 36TH, 37TH, 38TH, AND 39TH WEEKS OF GESTATIONAL AGE. THE MATCHED CONTROL GROUP DID NOT PERFORM YOGA. THE PATIENTS WERE FOLLOWED TILL DELIVERY FOR MATERNAL COMFORT, ALLEVIATION OF LABOR PAIN, AND BIRTH OUTCOME. ALLEVIATION OF LABOR PAIN WAS ASSESSED BY USING NUMERICAL PAIN INTENSITY SCALE (NPIS), PAIN BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONAL SCALE (PBOS), AND MATERNAL DELIVERY COMFORT QUESTIONNAIRE. ONLY THE ASSESSORS WERE BLINDED. RESULTS: TWO HUNDRED PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO 100 EACH IN CASE AND CONTROL GROUPS. FINAL ANALYSIS WAS DONE ON 75 PATIENTS IN EACH GROUP AFTER EXCLUSION DUE TO DEVELOPMENT OF COMPLICATIONS, LOSS TO FOLLOW-UP. THE REQUIREMENT OF INDUCTION OF LABOR AND ANALGESICS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS IN THE STUDY GROUP (P < 0.044, P < 0.045). THERE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE NUMBER OF NORMAL VAGINAL DELIVERIES (P < 0.037) AND LESS CAESAREAN SECTIONS (P < 0.048), SHORTER FIRST STAGE OF LABOR (P < 0.0003) IN THE STUDY GROUP PRACTICING YOGA. THE TOLERANCE OF PAIN WAS BETTER IN THE STUDY GROUP AS SHOWN BY NPIS (P < 0.001) AND PBOS SCORES (P < 0.0001). POSTPARTUM, THE MATERNAL COMFORT QUESTIONNAIRE SCORE SHOWED HIGHER COMFORT IN THE STUDY GROUP (P < 0.032). THE NUMBER OF LOW BIRTH WEIGHT BABIES WAS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY LESS IN THE STUDY GROUP (P < 0.042). THERE WERE NO ADVERSE EFFECTS ATTRIBUTED TO YOGA. CONCLUSION: THE STUDY HAS HIGHLIGHTED THAT YOGA IS A NONINVASIVE, EASY TO LEARN MIND-BODY MEDICINE AND COMPLEMENTARY HEALTH PRACTICE, EFFECTIVE IN ALLEVIATION OF LABOR PAIN AND POSSIBLY IMPROVING BIRTH OUTCOME.	2018	

19 2897  36 [EFFECTS OF A YOGA-FOCUSED PRENATAL PROGRAM ON STRESS, ANXIETY, SELF CONFIDENCE AND LABOR PAIN IN PREGNANT WOMEN WITH IN VITRO FERTILIZATION TREATMENT]. PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO IDENTIFY THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA-FOCUSED PRENATAL PROGRAM ON THE STRESS, ANXIETY, SELF CONFIDENCE AND LABOR PAIN OF PREGNANT WOMEN WHO HAD IN VITRO FERTILIZATION (IVF) TREATMENT. METHODS: A QUASI EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WITH A NON-EQUIVALENT CONTROL GROUP PRETEST-POSTTEST DESIGN WAS USED. THE DATA COLLECTION PERIOD AND MEDITATION PROGRAM WERE BETWEEN JANUARY 9 AND AUGUST 31, 2009. FORTY-SIX WOMEN WHO WERE PREGNANT FOLLOWING IVF, AND WERE BETWEEN 12-20 WEEKS GESTATION, PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY (23 EXPERIMENTAL GROUP, 23 CONTROL GROUP). DATA WERE ANALYZED USING CHI-SQUARE TEST, MANN-WHITNEY U TEST, ANCOVA, AND CRONBACH'S ALPHA COEFFICIENTS WITH THE SPSS 12.0 FOR WINDOWS PROGRAM. RESULTS: ALTHOUGH THE SAMPLE SIZE WAS LIMITED, WOMEN WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE PROGRAM SHOWED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN STRESS, ANXIETY, LABOR PAIN, AND LABOR CONFIDENCE FOR WOMEN PREGNANT AFTER IVF. CONCLUSION: THE RESULT INDICATE THAT THIS 12-WEEK YOGA-FOCUSED EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM CAN BE UTILIZED FOR WOMEN PREGNANT FOLLOWING IVF TO REDUCE THEIR STRESS, ANXIETY, AND LABOR PAIN, AND TO INCREASE DELIVERY CONFIDENCE. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE YOGA-FOCUSED EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM BE OFFERED TO EVERY PREGNANT WOMAN.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
20 1022  44 EFFECTS OF YOGA AND MEDITATION ON THE BIRTH PROCESS. CONTEXT: DURING LABOR, CONSCIOUS MATERNAL EXPULSIVE EFFORTS ARE CRUCIAL, ESPECIALLY IN THE SECOND STAGE. CONTEMPORARILY, MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL'S BEDSIDE OBSERVATIONS INDICATE AN INADEQUACY IN THE MATERNAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE PROCESS OF DELIVERY THAT HAS LED TO INCREASED RATES OF CAESAREAN SECTIONS AND INTERVENTIONAL DELIVERIES. FOR THAT REASON, THE IMPORTANCE OF YOGA, MEDITATION, AND BREATH-AWARENESS PRACTICES INCREASES DURING PREGNANCY AND BIRTH. OBJECTIVE: THE STUDY INTENDED TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT ON THE DELIVERY PROCESS OF THE PRACTICE OF YOGA AND MEDITATION DURING PREGNANCY AND LABOR. DESIGN: THE RESEARCH TEAM DESIGNED A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: THE RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED BETWEEN OCTOBER 2016 AND MAY 2018 AT AN EDUCATIONAL AND RESEARCH HOSPITAL IN ISTANBUL, TURKEY, ON THE ANATOLIAN SIDE OF THE ISTANBUL PROVINCE. PARTICIPANTS: PARTICIPANTS WERE 90 PRIMIPAROUS PREGNANT WOMEN WHO APPLIED TO THE PREGNANCY SCHOOL AT THE HOSPITAL AND WHO MET THE CRITERIA FOR ACCEPTANCE INTO THE STUDY. INTERVENTION: THE PARTICIPANTS WAS RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS, 30 IN AN INTERVENTION GROUP AND 60 IN A CONTROL GROUP. THE INTERVENTION GROUP PERFORMED YOGA AND MEDITATION FOR 60 MINUTES TWO TIMES A WEEK FOR 10 WEEKS. YOGA AND MEDITATION PRACTICES ALSO OCCURRED DURING THE COURSE OF LABOR FOR THE INTERVENTION GROUP. ROUTINE MIDWIFERY CARE WAS GIVEN TO BOTH GROUPS DURING LABOR. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE DATA WERE COLLECTED USING: (1) THE STATE TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY (STAI), (2) THE WIJMA DELIVERY EXPECTANCY/EXPERIENCE QUESTIONNAIRE A, (3) THE CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY SCALE (CBSEI) SHORT FORM, (4) THE WIJMA DELIVERY EXPECTANCY/EXPERIENCE QUESTIONNAIRE VERSION B, AND (5) A VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS) FOR PAIN. RESULTS: WHEN THE LABOR DATA WERE EVALUATED, THE INTERVENTION GROUP HAD STATISTICALLY HIGHER VAGINAL DELIVERY RATES, LOWER LABOR INTERVENTION RATES AND EPISIOTOMY OPENING FREQUENCIES, LOWER PAIN MEASUREMENT SCORES AND WIJMA B SCORES, AND HIGHER CBSEI SCORES THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. HOWEVER, THE INTERVENTION GROUP'S STAI SCORES HAD INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER THE PRACTICE POST INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA AND MEDITATION ARE EFFECTIVE METHODS FOR REDUCING PAIN AND FEAR PERCEPTION AND INCREASING SELF-EFFICACY AND VAGINAL DELIVERY RATES DURING THE LABOR PROCESS.	2022

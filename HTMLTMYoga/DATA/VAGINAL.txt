1 2124 94 THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PRENATAL YOGA ON DELIVERY OUTCOMES: A META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: THE EFFICACY OF YOGA ON DELIVERY OUTCOMES REMAINING CONTROVERSY. OBJECTIVES: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF PRENATAL YOGA ON DELIVERY OUTCOMES. METHODS: THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, PUBMED, EMBASE, WEB OF SCIENCE, CINAHL AND ELSEVIER DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FROM INCEPTION TO JANUARY 22, 2020, AND RANDOMIZED, QUASI-RANDOMIZED AND NON-RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS EVALUATING THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE DELIVERY OUTCOMES IN PREGNANT WOMEN WERE INCLUDED. THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY WAS ASSESSED BY THE COCHRANE COLLABORATION'S TOOL. META-ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED USING REVMAN 5.3. RESULTS: THIS META-ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED THAT YOGA IMPROVED VAGINAL DELIVERY, DECREASED PREMATURE DELIVERY AND BIRTH WEIGHT OF NEWBORNS, SHORTEN THE LABOR DURATION. CONCLUSION: PRENATAL YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE TO IMPROVE DELIVERY OUTCOMES AND NOT TO INCREASE THE RISK OF FETUS, WHICH IS WORTH RECOMMENDING TO PREGNANT WOMEN. BUT STUDIES INVOLVED IN THIS META-ANALYSIS WERE NOT ALL OF HIGH QUALITY.

2 2066 53 THE CHARACTERISTICS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF PREGNANCY YOGA INTERVENTIONS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS A POPULAR MIND-BODY MEDICINE FREQUENTLY RECOMMENDED TO PREGNANT WOMEN. GAPS REMAIN IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE CORE COMPONENTS OF EFFECTIVE PREGNANCY YOGA PROGRAMMES. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS EXAMINED THE CHARACTERISTICS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF PREGNANCY YOGA INTERVENTIONS, INCORPORATING THE FITT (FREQUENCY, INTENSITY, TIME/DURATION AND TYPE) PRINCIPLE OF EXERCISE PRESCRIPTION. METHODS: NINE ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE SEARCHED: MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, WHOLIS, AMED, SCIELO, ASSIA AND WEB OF SCIENCE. RANDOMISED CONTROL TRIALS AND QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES EXAMINING PREGNANCY YOGA INTERVENTIONS WERE ELIGIBLE. COVIDENCE WAS USED TO SCREEN TITLES, ABSTRACTS, AND FULL-TEXT ARTICLES. OUTCOMES OF INTEREST WERE STRESS, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, QUALITY OF LIFE, LABOUR DURATION, PAIN MANAGEMENT IN LABOUR AND MODE OF BIRTH. THE COCHRANE COLLABORATION'S RISK OF BIAS ASSESSMENT TOOL WAS USED TO ASSESS METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF STUDIES AND GRADE CRITERIA (GRADEPRO) EVALUATED QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE. META-ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED USING REVMAN 5.3. RESULTS: OF 862 CITATIONS RETRIEVED, 31 STUDIES MET INCLUSION CRITERIA. TWENTY-NINE STUDIES WITH 2217 PREGNANT WOMEN WERE INCLUDED FOR META-ANALYSIS. PREGNANCY YOGA INTERVENTIONS REDUCED ANXIETY (SMD: -0.91; 95% CI: - 1.49 TO - 0.33; P = 0.002), DEPRESSION (SMD: -0.47; 95% CI: - 0.9 TO - 0.04, P = 0.03) AND PERCEIVED STRESS (SMD: -1.03; 95% CI: - 1.55 TO - 0.52; P < 0.001). YOGA INTERVENTIONS ALSO REDUCED DURATION OF LABOUR (MD = - 117.75; 95% CI - 153.80 TO - 81.71, P < 0.001) AND, INCREASED ODDS OF NORMAL VAGINAL BIRTH (OR 2.58; 95% CI 1.46-4.56, P < 0.001) AND TOLERANCE FOR PAIN. THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE (GRADE CRITERIA) WAS LOW TO VERY LOW FOR ALL OUTCOMES. TWELVE OR MORE YOGA SESSIONS DELIVERED WEEKLY/BI-WEEKLY HAD A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON MODE OF BIRTH, WHILE 12 OR MORE YOGA SESSIONS OF LONG DURATION (> 60 MIN) HAD A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PERCEIVED STRESS. CONCLUSION: THE EVIDENCE HIGHLIGHTS POSITIVE EFFECTS OF PREGNANCY YOGA ON ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, PERCEIVED STRESS, MODE OF BIRTH AND DURATION OF LABOUR.

3 2524 22 YOGA DURING PREGNANCY: EFFECTS ON MATERNAL COMFORT, LABOR PAIN AND BIRTH OUTCOMES. THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA PROGRAM DURING PREGNANCY, ON MATERNAL COMFORT, LABOR PAIN, AND BIRTH OUTCOMES. A RANDOMIZED TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED USING 74-PRIMIGRAVID THAI WOMEN WHO WERE EQUALLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS (EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL). THE YOGA PROGRAM INVOLVED SIX, 1-H SESSIONS AT PRESCRIBED WEEKS OF GESTATION. A VARIETY OF INSTRUMENTS WERE USED TO ASSESS MATERNAL COMFORT, LABOR PAIN AND BIRTH OUTCOMES. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS FOUND TO HAVE HIGHER LEVELS OF MATERNAL COMFORT DURING LABOR AND 2H POST-LABOR, AND EXPERIENCED LESS SUBJECT EVALUATED LABOR PAIN THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. IN EACH GROUP, PAIN INCREASED AND MATERNAL COMFORT DECREASED AS LABOR PROGRESSED. NO DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND, BETWEEN THE GROUPS, REGARDING PETHIDINE USAGE, LABOR AUGMENTATION OR NEWBORN APGAR SCORES AT 1 AND 5 MIN. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS FOUND TO HAVE A SHORTER DURATION OF THE FIRST STAGE OF LABOR, AS WELL AS THE TOTAL TIME OF LABOR.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
4 1797 37 PRENATAL YOGA: EFFECTS ON ALLEVIATION OF LABOR PAIN AND BIRTH OUTCOMES. BACKGROUND: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT PRENATAL YOGIC EXERCISES ARE EFFECTIVE IN ALLEVIATING LABOR PAIN AND IMPROVING BIRTH OUTCOMES, BY COMPARING PREGNANT WOMEN UNDERTAKING YOGA WITH A CONTROL GROUP. TRIAL DESIGN: SINGLE BLINDED, PARALLEL RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL. METHODS: TWO HUNDRED PRIMIGRAVID WOMEN OF 30 WEEKS OF GESTATION ONWARD WHO MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA (PRIMIGRAVIDA, 20-35 YEARS OF AGE, GESTATIONAL AGE OF 30 WEEKS, NO PRIOR EXPERIENCE OF YOGA) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO STUDY (N = 100) AND CONTROL GROUPS (N = 100) BY USING THE MINIMIZED RANDOMIZATION PROGRAM VERSION 2.01. THE STUDY GROUP RECEIVED THE INTERVENTION IN THE FORM OF INTEGRATED YOGA CONSISTING OF A SERIES OF 30-MIN PRACTICE SESSIONS AT THE 30TH, 32ND, 34TH, 36TH, 37TH, 38TH, AND 39TH WEEKS OF GESTATIONAL AGE. THE MATCHED CONTROL GROUP DID NOT PERFORM YOGA. THE PATIENTS WERE FOLLOWED TILL DELIVERY FOR MATERNAL COMFORT, ALLEVIATION OF LABOR PAIN, AND BIRTH OUTCOME. ALLEVIATION OF LABOR PAIN WAS ASSESSED BY USING NUMERICAL PAIN INTENSITY SCALE (NPIS), PAIN BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONAL SCALE (PBOS), AND MATERNAL DELIVERY COMFORT QUESTIONNAIRE. ONLY THE ASSESSORS WERE BLINDED. RESULTS: TWO HUNDRED PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO 100 EACH IN CASE AND CONTROL GROUPS. FINAL ANALYSIS WAS DONE ON 75 PATIENTS IN EACH GROUP AFTER EXCLUSION DUE TO DEVELOPMENT OF COMPLICATIONS, LOSS TO FOLLOW-UP. THE REQUIREMENT OF INDUCTION OF LABOR AND ANALGESICS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS IN THE STUDY GROUP (P < 0.044, P < 0.045). THERE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE NUMBER OF NORMAL VAGINAL DELIVERIES (P < 0.037) AND LESS CAESAREAN SECTIONS (P < 0.048), SHORTER FIRST STAGE OF LABOR (P < 0.0003) IN THE STUDY GROUP PRACTICING YOGA. THE TOLERANCE OF PAIN WAS BETTER IN THE STUDY GROUP AS SHOWN BY NPIS (P < 0.001) AND PBOS SCORES (P < 0.0001). POSTPARTUM, THE MATERNAL COMFORT QUESTIONNAIRE SCORE SHOWED HIGHER COMFORT IN THE STUDY GROUP (P < 0.032). THE NUMBER OF LOW BIRTH WEIGHT BABIES WAS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY LESS IN THE STUDY GROUP (P < 0.042). THERE WERE NO ADVERSE EFFECTS ATTRIBUTED TO YOGA. CONCLUSION: THE STUDY HAS HIGHLIGHTED THAT YOGA IS A NONINVASIVE, EASY TO LEARN MIND-BODY MEDICINE AND COMPLEMENTARY HEALTH PRACTICE, EFFECTIVE IN ALLEVIATION OF LABOR PAIN AND POSSIBLY IMPROVING BIRTH OUTCOME.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                      
5 1022 29 EFFECTS OF YOGA AND MEDITATION ON THE BIRTH PROCESS. CONTEXT: DURING LABOR, CONSCIOUS MATERNAL EXPULSIVE EFFORTS ARE CRUCIAL, ESPECIALLY IN THE SECOND STAGE. CONTEMPORARILY, MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL'S BEDSIDE OBSERVATIONS INDICATE AN INADEQUACY IN THE MATERNAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE PROCESS OF DELIVERY THAT HAS LED TO INCREASED RATES OF CAESAREAN SECTIONS AND INTERVENTIONAL DELIVERIES. FOR THAT REASON, THE IMPORTANCE OF YOGA, MEDITATION, AND BREATH-AWARENESS PRACTICES INCREASES DURING PREGNANCY AND BIRTH. OBJECTIVE: THE STUDY INTENDED TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT ON THE DELIVERY PROCESS OF THE PRACTICE OF YOGA AND MEDITATION DURING PREGNANCY AND LABOR. DESIGN: THE RESEARCH TEAM DESIGNED A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: THE RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED BETWEEN OCTOBER 2016 AND MAY 2018 AT AN EDUCATIONAL AND RESEARCH HOSPITAL IN ISTANBUL, TURKEY, ON THE ANATOLIAN SIDE OF THE ISTANBUL PROVINCE. PARTICIPANTS: PARTICIPANTS WERE 90 PRIMIPAROUS PREGNANT WOMEN WHO APPLIED TO THE PREGNANCY SCHOOL AT THE HOSPITAL AND WHO MET THE CRITERIA FOR ACCEPTANCE INTO THE STUDY. INTERVENTION: THE PARTICIPANTS WAS RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS, 30 IN AN INTERVENTION GROUP AND 60 IN A CONTROL GROUP. THE INTERVENTION GROUP PERFORMED YOGA AND MEDITATION FOR 60 MINUTES TWO TIMES A WEEK FOR 10 WEEKS. YOGA AND MEDITATION PRACTICES ALSO OCCURRED DURING THE COURSE OF LABOR FOR THE INTERVENTION GROUP. ROUTINE MIDWIFERY CARE WAS GIVEN TO BOTH GROUPS DURING LABOR. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE DATA WERE COLLECTED USING: (1) THE STATE TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY (STAI), (2) THE WIJMA DELIVERY EXPECTANCY/EXPERIENCE QUESTIONNAIRE A, (3) THE CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY SCALE (CBSEI) SHORT FORM, (4) THE WIJMA DELIVERY EXPECTANCY/EXPERIENCE QUESTIONNAIRE VERSION B, AND (5) A VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS) FOR PAIN. RESULTS: WHEN THE LABOR DATA WERE EVALUATED, THE INTERVENTION GROUP HAD STATISTICALLY HIGHER VAGINAL DELIVERY RATES, LOWER LABOR INTERVENTION RATES AND EPISIOTOMY OPENING FREQUENCIES, LOWER PAIN MEASUREMENT SCORES AND WIJMA B SCORES, AND HIGHER CBSEI SCORES THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. HOWEVER, THE INTERVENTION GROUP'S STAI SCORES HAD INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER THE PRACTICE POST INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA AND MEDITATION ARE EFFECTIVE METHODS FOR REDUCING PAIN AND FEAR PERCEPTION AND INCREASING SELF-EFFICACY AND VAGINAL DELIVERY RATES DURING THE LABOR PROCESS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                   
6 2671 24 YOGA IN PREGNANCY: AN EXAMINATION OF MATERNAL AND FETAL RESPONSES TO 26 YOGA POSTURES. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE ACUTE MATERNAL AND FETAL EFFECTS OF YOGA POSTURES AND SUSPECTED CONTRAINDICATED POSTURES IN A PROSPECTIVE COHORT OF HEALTHY PREGNANT WOMEN IN THE THIRD TRIMESTER. METHODS: THIS WAS A PROSPECTIVE STUDY THAT EVALUATED PREGNANT WOMEN BETWEEN 35 0/7 AND 37 6/7 WEEKS OF GESTATION IN A ONE-ON-ONE YOGA SESSION. A BASELINE NONSTRESS TEST, VITAL SIGNS, AND PULSE OXIMETRY WERE PERFORMED. PARTICIPANTS THEN ASSUMED 26 YOGA POSTURES. VITAL SIGNS, PULSE OXIMETRY, TOCOMETRY, AND CONTINUOUS FETAL HEART RATE MONITORING WERE OBTAINED IN EACH POSTURE. POSTSESSION NONSTRESS TEST, VITAL SIGNS, AND PULSE OXIMETRY WERE OBTAINED. PARTICIPANTS WERE CONTACTED 24 HOURS POSTSESSION. RESULTS: TWENTY-FIVE HEALTHY PREGNANT WOMEN WERE EVALUATED. TEN REPORTED REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE, EIGHT WERE FAMILIAR WITH YOGA, AND SEVEN HAD NO YOGA EXPERIENCE. YOGA GROUPS WERE SIMILAR IN AGE, RACE, BODY MASS INDEX, GESTATIONAL AGE, AND PARITY. PRESESSION AND POSTSESSION NONSTRESS TESTS WERE REACTIVE. PRESESSION AND POSTSESSION DATA SHOWED NO CHANGE IN MATERNAL HEART RATE, TEMPERATURE, PULSE OXIMETRY, OR FETAL HEART RATE. DURING THE 26 YOGA POSTURES, VITAL SIGNS, PULSE OXIMETRY, AND UTERINE TOCOMETRY REMAINED NORMAL IN ALL WOMEN AND IN ALL POSTURES. THE FETAL HEART RATE ACROSS ALL 26 POSTURES WAS NORMAL. THERE WERE NO FALLS OR INJURIES DURING THE TOTAL CUMULATIVE 650 POSES. NO PARTICIPANTS REPORTED DECREASED FETAL MOVEMENT, CONTRACTIONS, LEAKAGE OF FLUID, OR VAGINAL BLEEDING IN THE 24-HOUR FOLLOW-UP. CONCLUSION: ALL 26 YOGA POSTURES WERE WELL-TOLERATED WITH NO ACUTE ADVERSE MATERNAL PHYSIOLOGIC OR FETAL HEART RATE CHANGES.

7 1135 27 EFFICACY OF YOGA ON PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISCOMFORTS AND DELIVERY OUTCOMES IN CHINESE PRIMIPARAS. BACKGROUD AND PURPOSE: ALMOST EVERY WOMAN EXPERIENCES DISCOMFORTS DURING PREGNANCY. THIS STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA ON PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISCOMFORTS AND DELIVERY OUTCOMES IN CHINESE PRIMIPARAS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED. PARTICIPANTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP (N = 32) RECEIVED ROUTINE PRENATAL CARE, WHEREAS PARTICIPANTS IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 32) RECEIVED ROUTINE PRENATAL CARE AND YOGA EXERCISE THREE TIMES A WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS. OUTCOMES EVALUATED INCLUDED PHYSIOLOGICAL DISCOMFORTS, PRENATAL DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY AND DELIVERY OUTCOMES. INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED. RESULTS: YOGA DECREASED THE SYMPTOMS OF PHYSIOLOGICAL DISCOMFORTS DURING PREGNANCY (F = 6.966, P = 0.010), PROMOTED CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY (F = 11.900, P = 0.001), INCREASED THE RATE OF VAGINAL DELIVERY (CHI(2) = 4.267, P = 0.039), AND SHORTENED THE LENGTH OF THE FIRST (T = -2.612, P = 0.012), SECOND (Z = -3.313, P = 0.001) AND THIRD STAGES OF LABOR (Z = -3.137, P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: YOGA OFFERS BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON PHYSIOLOGICAL DISCOMFORTS, CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY AND DELIVERY OUTCOMES IN CHINESE PRIMIPARAS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
8  688 35 EFFECT OF ANTENATAL EXERCISES, INCLUDING YOGA, ON THE COURSE OF LABOR, DELIVERY AND PREGNANCY: A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY. BACKGROUND: DELIVERING A CHILD IS A VERY STRESSFUL EXPERIENCE FOR WOMEN. PREGNANCY AND LABOR ENTAIL COMPLEX EVENTS THAT ARE UNIQUE TO EACH INDIVIDUAL FEMALE. THE MANAGEMENT OF LABOR PAIN IS OFTEN DONE USING ANALGESICS AND ANESTHESIA, WHICH HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE SOME SIDE EFFECTS. MORE COMPREHENSIVE DATA ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT EVIDENCE FOR CLINICIANS TO CONFIDENTLY PRESCRIBE EXERCISES TO PATIENTS. THIS STUDY WAS DONE TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF ANTENATAL EXERCISES, INCLUDING YOGA, ON THE COURSE OF LABOR, DELIVERY, AND PREGNANCY OUTCOMES. METHODS: A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AMONG 200 PRIMIPAROUS SUBJECTS (AGED 20-40). A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS PROVIDED TO THE SUBJECTS TO OBTAIN THEIR DEMOGRAPHIC AND OBSTETRICAL INFORMATION 6 WEEKS AFTER DELIVERY, AND THEIR HOSPITAL RECORDS WERE ALSO ASSESSED FOR FURTHER DETAILS. BASED ON THE NATURE AND DETAILS OBTAINED FOR THE ANTENATAL EXERCISES, SUBJECTS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: CONTROL AND EXERCISE. OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED THE NEED FOR LABOR INDUCTION, SELF-PERCEIVED PAIN AND PERCEIVED EXERTION DURING LABOR, DURATION AND NATURE OF THE DELIVERY, NEWBORN INFANT WEIGHT, MATERNAL WEIGHT GAIN, HISTORY OF BACK PAIN, AND POST-PARTUM RECOVERY. THE TOTAL MATERNAL WEIGHT GAIN (IN KILOGRAMS) WAS CALCULATED FROM WEIGHT AT 6 WEEKS AFTER DELIVERY MINUS THE WEIGHT AT 12-14 WEEKS OF GESTATION. BACK PAIN DURING PREGNANCY AND SELF-PERCEIVED LABOR PAIN WERE MEASURED USING A VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS). THE OVERALL PERCEIVED EXERTION DURING LABOR WAS MEASURED USING AN ADAPTED BORG SCALE FOR PERCEIVED EFFORT. RESULTS: THE SUBJECTS WHO FOLLOWED REGULAR ANTENATAL EXERCISES, INCLUDING YOGA, HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER RATES OF CESAREAN SECTION, LOWER WEIGHT GAIN, HIGHER NEWBORN INFANT WEIGHT, LOWER PAIN AND OVERALL DISCOMFORT DURING LABOR, LOWER BACK PAIN THROUGHOUT PREGNANCY, AND EARLIER POST-PARTUM RECOVERY COMPARED TO THOSE WHO DID NO SPECIFIC EXERCISES OR ONLY WALKED DURING PREGNANCY. CONCLUSIONS: THIS RETROSPECTIVE STUDY SHOWED THAT REGULAR ANTENATAL EXERCISES, INCLUDING YOGA, RESULT IN BETTER OUTCOMES RELATED TO THE COURSE OF LABOR, DELIVERY, AND PREGNANCY. THESE RESULTS NOTABLY INDICATED THAT PREGNANT WOMEN SHOULD BE ACTIVE THROUGHOUT PREGNANCY AND FOLLOW A SUPERVISED EXERCISE PROGRAM THAT INCLUDES YOGA UNLESS CONTRAINDICATED. WE REQUIRE FURTHER LARGE-SCALE PROSPECTIVE STUDIES AND QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL TRIALS TO CONFIRM THE OBSERVED FINDINGS.	2020	

9 2088 26 THE EFFECT OF PRACTICING YOGA DURING PREGNANCY ON LABOR STAGES LENGTH, ANXIETY AND PAIN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: ANXIETY AND FEAR OF LABOR PAIN HAS LED TO ELEVATED CESAREAN SECTION RATE IN SOME COUNTRIES. THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA IN PREGNANCY ON ANXIETY, LABOR PAIN AND LENGTH OF LABOR STAGES. METHODS: THIS CLINICAL TRIAL STUDY WAS PERFORMED ON 84 NULLIPAROUS WOMEN WHO WERE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OLD AND WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS OF YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS. PREGNANCY YOGA PROGRAM CONSISTING OF 6 60-MIN TRAINING SESSIONS WAS STARTED EVERY 2 WEEKS FROM WEEK 26 OF PREGNANCY AND CONTINUED UNTIL 37 WEEKS OF GESTATION. ANXIETY SEVERITY AT MATERNAL ADMISSION TO LABOR WAS MEASURED BY THE SPIELBERGERS STATE-TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY, AND LABOR PAIN WAS MEASURED BY VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS) AT DILATATION (4-5 CM) AND 2 H AFTER THE FIRST MEASUREMENT. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING CHI-SQUARE AND T-TEST. RESULTS: INTERVENTION GROUP REPORTED LESS PAIN AT DILATATION (4-5 CM) (P=0.001) AND 2 H AFTER THE FIRST MEASUREMENT (P=0.001) THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. STAT ANXIETY WAS ALSO LOWER IN INTERVENTION GROUP THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (P=0.003) AT THE ENTRANCE TO LABOR ROOM. SUBJECTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP REQUIRED MORE INDUCTION COMPARED TO INTERVENTION GROUP (P=0.003). WOMEN IN INTERVENTION GROUP EXPERIENCED SHORTER DURATION OF THE FIRST PHASE OF THE LABOR THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (P=0.002). ALSO, THE TOTAL DURATION OF TWO STAGES OF LABOR WAS SHORTER IN INTERVENTION GROUP THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: PRACTICING YOGA DURING PREGNANCY MAY REDUCE WOMEN'S ANXIETY DURING LABOR; SHORTEN LABOR STAGES, AND LOWER LABOR PAIN.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
10 2113 35 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE DELIVERY AND NEONATAL OUTCOMES IN NULLIPAROUS PREGNANT WOMEN IN IRAN: A CLINICAL TRIAL STUDY. BACKGROUND: YOGA CAN REDUCE THE RISK OF PRETERM DELIVERY, CESAREAN SECTION (CS), AND FETAL DEATH. THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PREGNANCY, DELIVERY, AND NEONATAL OUTCOMES. METHODS: THIS WAS A CLINICAL TRIAL STUDY AND USING THE RANDOM SAMPLING WITHOUT REPLACEMENT 70 PREGNANT WOMEN ENTERED HATHA YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS ACCORDING TO THE COLOR OF THE BALL THEY TOOK FROM A BAG CONTAINING TWO BALLS (BLUE OR RED). THE DATA COLLECTION TOOL WAS A QUESTIONNAIRE PREGNANCY, DELIVERY, AND NEONATAL OUTCOMES. THE INTERVENTION IN THIS STUDY INCLUDED PREGNANCY HATHA YOGA EXERCISES THAT FIRST SESSION OF PREGNANCY YOGA STARTED FROM THE 26TH WEEK AND SAMPLES ATTENDED THE LAST SESSION IN THE 37TH WEEK. THEY EXERCISED YOGA TWICE A WEEK (EACH SESSION LASTING 75 MIN) IN A YOGA SPECIALIZED SPORTS CLUB. THE CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED THE ROUTINE PRENATAL CARE THAT ALL PREGNANT WOMEN RECEIVE. RESULTS: THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT YOGA REDUCED THE INDUCTION OF LABOR, THE EPISIOTOMY RUPTURE, DURATION OF LABOR, ALSO HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON NORMAL BIRTH WEIGHT AND DELIVERY AT THE APPROPRIATE GESTATIONAL AGE. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND APGAR SCORES OF THE INFANTS. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS OF THE PRESENT STUDY SHOWED THAT YOGA CAN IMPROVE THE OUTCOMES OF PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH. THEY CAN BE USED AS PART OF THE CARE PROTOCOL ALONG WITH CHILDBIRTH PREPARATION CLASSES TO REDUCE THE COMPLICATIONS OF PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH.

11 2525 29 YOGA DURING PREGNANCY: THE EFFECTS ON LABOR PAIN AND DELIVERY OUTCOMES (A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL). OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF AN ANTENATAL YOGA PROGRAM ON PERCEIVED MATERNAL LABOR PAIN AND DELIVERY OUTCOMES. MATERIAL & METHODS: THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED WITH SIXTY PRIMIPAROUS WOMEN, AGED 18-35 YEARS OLD, WHO WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER AN ANTENATAL YOGA PROGRAM OR CONTROL GROUPS. LABOR PAIN AND DISCOMFORT LEVEL OF THE PARTICIPANTS WERE MEASURED USING A VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE AT CERVICAL DILATATION OF 3-4 C AND AT 2 AND 4 H AFTER THE INITIAL MEASUREMENT. DEMOGRAPHIC AND OBSTETRICAL INFORMATION WERE COLLECTED. THE ANTENATAL YOGA PROGRAM CONSISTED OF A 1-H SUPERVISED YOGA CLASS, THREE TIMES A WEEKLY, STARTING AT 26 WEEKS GESTATION. . RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS IN CONTROL GROUP REPORTED HIGHER PAIN INTENSITY COMPARED TO EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AT 3-4 CM OF DILATATION (P = 0.01) AND AT 2 H AFTER THE FIRST AND THE SECOND MEASUREMENTS (P = 0.000). MOTHERS IN THE ANTENATAL INTERVENTION GROUP THAT COMPLETED THE YOGA CLASS REQUIRED A DECREASED FREQUENCY OF LABOR INDUCTION IN COMPARISON WITH CONTROL GROUP (P = 0.008). IN ADDITION, MODE OF DELIVERY OF THE INTERVENTION GROUP RESULTED IN A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF CESAREAN SECTION THAN CONTROL GROUP (P = 0.002). LASTLY, THE INTERVENTION GROUP EXPERIENCED A SHORTER DURATION OF THE SECOND AND THIRD STAGES OF LABOR. INTERVAL LEVEL DATA WAS ANALYZED BY USING AN INDEPENDENT T-TEST AND CHI-SQUARE. CONCLUSION: YOGA DURING PREGNANCY MAY CONTRIBUTE TO A REDUCTION PAIN OF LABOR AND IMPROVED ADEQUACY OF CHILDBIRTH.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
12 1136 29 EFFICACY OF YOGA ON PREGNANCY OUTCOME. OBJECTIVE: TO STUDY THE EFFICACY OF YOGA ON PREGNANCY OUTCOMES. DESIGN AND SETTING: THREE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE (335) WOMEN ATTENDING THE ANTENATAL CLINIC AT GUNASHEELA SURGICAL AND MATERNITY HOSPITAL IN BANGALORE, INDIA, WERE ENROLLED BETWEEN 18 AND 20 WEEKS OF PREGNANCY IN A PROSPECTIVE, MATCHED, OBSERVATIONAL STUDY; 169 WOMEN IN THE YOGA GROUP AND 166 WOMEN IN THE CONTROL GROUP. METHODS: WOMEN WERE MATCHED FOR AGE, PARITY, BODY WEIGHT, AND DOPPLER VELOCIMETRY SCORES OF UMBILICAL AND UTERINE ARTERIES. YOGA PRACTICES, INCLUDING PHYSICAL POSTURES, BREATHING, AND MEDITATION WERE PRACTICED BY THE YOGA GROUP ONE HOUR DAILY, FROM THE DATE OF ENTRY INTO THE STUDY UNTIL DELIVERY. THE CONTROL GROUP WALKED 30 MINUTES TWICE A DAY (STANDARD OBSTETRIC ADVICE) DURING THE STUDY PERIOD. COMPLIANCE IN BOTH GROUPS WAS ENSURED BY FREQUENT TELEPHONE CALLS AND STRICT MAINTENANCE OF AN ACTIVITY DIARY. MAIN OUTCOMES: BIRTH WEIGHT AND GESTATIONAL AGE AT DELIVERY WERE PRIMARY OUTCOMES. RESULTS: THE NUMBER OF BABIES WITH BIRTH WEIGHT > OR = 2500 GRAMS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER (P < 0.01) IN THE YOGA GROUP. PRETERM LABOR WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER (P < 0.0006) IN THE YOGA GROUP. COMPLICATIONS SUCH AS ISOLATED INTRAUTERINE GROWTH RETARDATION (IUGR) (P < 0.003) AND PREGNANCY-INDUCED HYPERTENSION (PIH) WITH ASSOCIATED IUGR (P < 0.025) WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN THE YOGA GROUP. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECTS NOTED IN THE YOGA GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO YOGA DURING PREGNANCY IS SAFE. IT IMPROVES BIRTH WEIGHT, DECREASES PRETERM LABOR, AND DECREASES IUGR EITHER IN ISOLATION OR ASSOCIATED WITH PIH, WITH NO INCREASED COMPLICATIONS.	2005	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
13 2523 31 YOGA DURING PREGNANCY: A REVIEW. THE PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW ARTICLE IS TO EVALUATE THE PERIPARTUM OUTCOMES OF YOGA DURING PREGNANCY, INCLUDING THE POSTPARTUM PERIOD AND LACTATION. THE PUBMED DATABASE WAS ANALYZED FROM JANUARY 1970 TO JANUARY 2011. WE IDENTIFIED FIVE PROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES (N = 575) AND THREE RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS (RCTS; N = 298), WHICH WERE ANALYZED SEPARATELY. THE NONRANDOMIZED TRIALS INDICATED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN RATES OF PRETERM LABOR (P < 0.0006), INTRAUTERINE GROWTH RETARDATION (P <0.003), LOW BIRTH WEIGHT (P < 0.01), PREGNANCY DISCOMFORTS (P = 0.01), AND PERCEIVED SLEEP DISTURBANCES (P = 0.03) IN THOSE WHO PRACTICED YOGA DURING PREGNANCY. RESULTS OF THE RCTS INDICATED THAT DOING YOGA DURING PREGNANCY CAN SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER PAIN AND DISCOMFORT (P < 0.05) AND PERCEIVED STRESS (P = 0.001) AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE IN PHYSICAL DOMAINS (P = 0.001). ALL THREE RCTS WERE POORLY COMPLIANT WITH THE CONSOLIDATED STANDARD OF REPORTING TRIALS STATEMENT. WHILE AWAITING AN APPROPRIATELY DESIGNED RCT TO DETERMINE THE BENEFITS OF YOGA DURING PREGNANCY, IT REMAINS A VIABLE EXERCISE OPTION.	2012

15 2231 22 THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON FEAR OF CHILDBIRTH AND CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY AMONG THIRD TRIMESTER PREGNANTS. BACKGROUND: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICE ON FEAR OF CHILDBIRTH AND CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS STUDY WAS PERFORMED IN A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL MODEL WITH PRETEST AND POST-TEST CONTROL GROUPS. THE PARTICIPANTS OF THE STUDY WERE WOMEN WHO APPLIED TO A PREGNANCY EDUCATION CLASS AT A HOSPITAL. NINETY WOMEN PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY. THE DATA USED IN THE STUDY WERE COLLECTED USING THE INDIVIDUAL INFORMATION FORM, THE WIJMA DELIVERY EXPECTATION/EXPERIENCE SCALE (VERSION A), AND THE CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY SCALE. RESULTS: AFTER PARTICIPATING IN YOGA PRACTICE, THE PREGNANT WOMEN IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP EXHIBITED DECREASED FEAR OF CHILDBIRTH AND INCREASED CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY (P < .05). ON THE OTHER HAND, THE PREGNANT WOMEN IN THE CONTROL GROUP DISPLAYED INCREASED FEAR OF CHILDBIRTH AND DECREASED CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY (P < .05). CONCLUSION: BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY, YOGA PRACTICE REDUCES FEAR OF CHILDBIRTH AND SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES CHILDBIRTH SELF-EFFICACY.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
16 2897 26 [EFFECTS OF A YOGA-FOCUSED PRENATAL PROGRAM ON STRESS, ANXIETY, SELF CONFIDENCE AND LABOR PAIN IN PREGNANT WOMEN WITH IN VITRO FERTILIZATION TREATMENT]. PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO IDENTIFY THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA-FOCUSED PRENATAL PROGRAM ON THE STRESS, ANXIETY, SELF CONFIDENCE AND LABOR PAIN OF PREGNANT WOMEN WHO HAD IN VITRO FERTILIZATION (IVF) TREATMENT. METHODS: A QUASI EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WITH A NON-EQUIVALENT CONTROL GROUP PRETEST-POSTTEST DESIGN WAS USED. THE DATA COLLECTION PERIOD AND MEDITATION PROGRAM WERE BETWEEN JANUARY 9 AND AUGUST 31, 2009. FORTY-SIX WOMEN WHO WERE PREGNANT FOLLOWING IVF, AND WERE BETWEEN 12-20 WEEKS GESTATION, PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY (23 EXPERIMENTAL GROUP, 23 CONTROL GROUP). DATA WERE ANALYZED USING CHI-SQUARE TEST, MANN-WHITNEY U TEST, ANCOVA, AND CRONBACH'S ALPHA COEFFICIENTS WITH THE SPSS 12.0 FOR WINDOWS PROGRAM. RESULTS: ALTHOUGH THE SAMPLE SIZE WAS LIMITED, WOMEN WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE PROGRAM SHOWED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN STRESS, ANXIETY, LABOR PAIN, AND LABOR CONFIDENCE FOR WOMEN PREGNANT AFTER IVF. CONCLUSION: THE RESULT INDICATE THAT THIS 12-WEEK YOGA-FOCUSED EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM CAN BE UTILIZED FOR WOMEN PREGNANT FOLLOWING IVF TO REDUCE THEIR STRESS, ANXIETY, AND LABOR PAIN, AND TO INCREASE DELIVERY CONFIDENCE. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE YOGA-FOCUSED EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM BE OFFERED TO EVERY PREGNANT WOMAN.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
17 2169 27 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN PREVENTION OF PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS IN HIGH-RISK PREGNANCIES: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: WHILE PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA IN NORMAL PREGNANCIES, THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN PREVENTION OF PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS IN HIGH-RISK PREGNANCIES FOR THE FIRST TIME. METHODS: 68 HIGH-RISK PREGNANT WOMEN WERE RECRUITED FROM TWO MATERNITY HOSPITALS IN BENGALURU, INDIA AND WERE RANDOMIZED INTO YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS. THE YOGA GROUP (N=30) RECEIVED STANDARD CARE PLUS ONE-HOUR YOGA SESSIONS, THREE TIMES A WEEK, FROM THE 12TH TO THE 28TH WEEK OF GESTATION. THE CONTROL GROUP (N=38) RECEIVED STANDARD CARE PLUS CONVENTIONAL ANTENATAL EXERCISES (WALKING) DURING THE SAME PERIOD. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER PREGNANCY INDUCED HYPERTENSION (PIH), PREECLAMPSIA, GESTATIONAL DIABETES (GDM) AND INTRAUTERINE GROWTH RESTRICTION (IUGR) CASES WERE OBSERVED IN THE YOGA GROUP (P=0.018, 0.042, 0.049, 0.05 RESPECTIVELY). SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER SMALL FOR GESTATIONAL AGE (SGA) BABIES AND NEWBORNS WITH LOW APGAR SCORES (P=0.006) WERE BORN IN THE YOGA GROUP (P=0.033). CONCLUSION: THIS FIRST RANDOMIZED STUDY OF YOGA IN HIGH-RISK PREGNANCY HAS SHOWN THAT YOGA CAN POTENTIALLY BE AN EFFECTIVE THERAPY IN REDUCING HYPERTENSIVE RELATED COMPLICATIONS OF PREGNANCY AND IMPROVING FETAL OUTCOMES. ADDITIONAL DATA IS NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE RESULTS AND BETTER EXPLAIN THE MECHANISM OF ACTION OF YOGA IN THIS IMPORTANT AREA.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
18 2514 31 YOGA CAN IMPROVE ASSISTED REPRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY OUTCOMES IN COUPLES WITH INFERTILITY. CONTEXT: DEPENDING ON THE CAUSE OF THE INFERTILITY, NONSURGICAL OR SURGICAL TREATMENTS MAY BE USED TO TREAT MEN AND WOMEN WITH INFERTILITY. DESPITE IMPROVED OUTCOMES DUE TO MEDICAL ADVANCES, ASSISTED REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGY (ART) FOR COUPLES WITH INFERTILITY IS SOMETIMES UNSUCCESSFUL. SUCCESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY THE PATIENT'S SOCIAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND PHYSICAL STATUS. OBJECTIVE: THE STUDY EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA-INCLUDING ASANAS (YOGA POSES), PRANAYAMA (PROPER BREATHING), SHAVASANA, AND MEDITATION-ON MALE AND FEMALE FERTILITY AND ART OUTCOMES. DESIGN: THE RESEARCH TEAM PERFORMED A LITERATURE REVIEW, ELECTRONICALLY SEARCHING FOR ARTICLES PUBLISHED BETWEEN JANUARY 1978 AND JANUARY 2016 IN THE PUBMED, SCOPUS, SCIENCEDIRECT, AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR DATABASES. SETTING: THE STUDY TOOK PLACE AT THE REPRODUCTIVE BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH CENTER AT THE AVICENNA RESEARCH INSTITUTE AT THE ACADEMIC CENTER FOR EDUCATION, CULTURE, AND RESEARCH (TEHRAN, IRAN). PARTICIPANTS: PARTICIPANTS WERE COUPLES WITH INFERTILITY TAKING PART IN 87 REVIEWED STUDIES. INTERVENTION: YOGA WAS THE INTERVENTION. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE OUTCOME MEASURES COMPRISED FERTILITY FACTORS IN MALES AND FEMALES, FERTILITY RATE, AND ART SUCCESS RATE. RESULTS: THE REVIEWED STUDIES SHOWED THAT YOGA CAN PROVIDE STRESS MANAGEMENT FOR PATIENTS WITH INFERTILITY, WITH BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON FERTILITY, HELPING COUPLES GIVE BIRTH. THEY FOUND THAT YOGA ALSO COULD REDUCE PAIN; DECREASE DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND STRESS; REDUCE THE RATE OF ASSISTED VAGINAL DELIVERY; AND IMPROVE FETAL OUTCOMES. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA CAN HELP COUPLES OVERCOME INFERTILITY AND INCREASE THE ART SUCCESS RATE BY IMPROVING THE PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STATES OF BOTH MEN AND WOMEN.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
19 2703 23 YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN PREGNANCY: A QUALITATIVE REVIEW. OBJECTIVES: EVERY SECOND 4.3 BIRTHS OCCUR IN THE WORLD, SIGNIFYING THE MAGNITUDE AND IMPORTANCE OF PREGNANCY. THIS STUDY LOOKED AT YOGA INTERVENTIONS DONE FROM 2008 TO DECEMBER 2013 AND EXAMINED WHETHER YOGA CAN BE AN EFFICACIOUS APPROACH FOR INFLUENCING MATERNAL AND BIRTH OUTCOMES IN PREGNANCY. DESIGN: A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH OF MEDLINE (PUBMED), CINAHL, ALT HEALTHWATCH, COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS, AND ACP JOURNAL CLUB DATABASES WAS CONDUCTED FOR QUANTITATIVE ARTICLES OF PREGNANCY INVOLVING ALL SCHOOLS OF YOGA. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 15 ARTICLES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA: 6 FROM THE UNITED STATES, 6 FROM INDIA, 2 FROM TAIWAN, AND 1 EACH FROM KOREA AND THAILAND. OF THE 15 STUDIES, 10 SHOWED POSITIVE CHANGES IN MATERNAL PSYCHOLOGICAL OR BIRTH OUTCOMES. CONCLUSIONS: THE INCLUDED STUDIES HAVE SOME LIMITATIONS. NONETHELESS, YOGA APPEARS TO BE A PROMISING INTERVENTION FOR PREGNANCY.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
20 1134 18 EFFICACY OF YOGA IN PREGNANT WOMEN WITH ABNORMAL DOPPLER STUDY OF UMBILICAL AND UTERINE ARTERIES. TO STUDY THE EFFICACY OF YOGA ON THE OUTCOME OF COMPLICATED PREGNANCY, 121 WOMEN ATTENDING ANTENATAL CLINIC AT GUNASHEELA SURGICAL AND MATERNITY HOSPITAL (GSMH) IN BANGALORE, INDIA, WERE ENROLLED BETWEEN 18-20 WEEKS OF PREGNANCY IN A PROSPECTIVE, MATCHED, OBSERVATIONAL STUDY. SIXTY-EIGHT WOMEN WERE IN THE YOGA GROUP AND 53 WOMEN IN THE CONTROL GROUP. WOMEN WERE MATCHED FOR AGE, GRAVIDA AND DOPPLER VELOCIMETRY SCORES OF UMBILICAL AND UTERINE ARTERIES. YOGA PRACTICES INCLUDING PHYSICAL POSTURES, BREATHING AND MEDITATION WERE PRACTISED BY THE YOGA GROUP, ONE HOUR DAILY, FROM THE DATE OF ENTRY INTO THE STUDY UNTIL DELIVERY. THE CONTROL GROUP WALKED HALF AN HOUR TWICE A DAY DURING THE STUDY PERIOD. COMPLIANCE IN BOTH THE GROUPS WAS ENSURED. IN BABIES THE BIRTH-WEIGHT IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER (P < 0.018) IN THE YOGA GROUP (2.78 +/- 0.52 KG), COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP (2.55 +/- 0.52 KG). OCCURRENCE OF COMPLICATIONS OF PREGNANCY (PREGNANCY-INDUCED HYPERTENSION, INTRAUTERINE GROWTH RETARDATION, PRE-TERM DELIVERY) SHOWS LOWER TRENDS IN YOGA GROUP.	2005

1  360 137 ASSOCIATION OF YOGA PRACTICE AND SERUM CORTISOL LEVELS IN CHRONIC PERIODONTITIS PATIENTS WITH STRESS-RELATED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. AIM: REDUCING THE PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS BY VARIOUS METHODS CAN IMPROVE OVERALL HEALTH, AND YOGA IS NOW CONSIDERED AS AN EASILY AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVE METHOD. THE PRESENT CROSS-SECTIONAL PILOT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED MAINLY TO FIND THE ASSOCIATION OF YOGA PRACTICE WITH PERIODONTAL DISEASE BY MEASURING SERUM CORTISOL LEVELS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 70 SUBJECTS WITH AGE RANGE OF 35-60 YEARS SUFFERING WITH CHRONIC PERIODONTITIS WERE DIVIDED INTO GROUP I (WITH STRESS), GROUP II (WITHOUT STRESS), AND GROUP III (PRACTICING YOGA). PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION WAS CARRIED OUT USING HAMILTON ANXIETY RATING SCALE (HAM-A) AND ZUNG SELF-RATING DEPRESSION SCALE (ZSDS). PERIODONTAL PARAMETERS LIKE PLAQUE INDEX (PI), PROBING POCKET DEPTH (PPD), AND CLINICAL ATTACHMENT LEVEL (CAL) AT 5-8 MM AND >8 MM WERE RECORDED. BLOOD SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED AND SERUM CORTISOL LEVELS WERE MEASURED. RESULTS: MEAN AGE, PLAQUE SCORES, AND NUMBER OF TEETH WITH PPD AND CAL AT 5-8 MM AND >8 MM WERE SIMILAR IN ALL THE GROUPS, EXCEPT BETWEEN GROUP I AND GROUP III WHERE A MULTIPLE COMPARISON WITH TUKEY'S POST-HOC TEST SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN PLAQUE INDEX (P < 0.038) AND THE NUMBER OF TEETH WITH CAL 5-8 MM (P < 0.016). SERUM CORTISOL LEVELS AND HAM-A SCALE AND ZSDS SCORES SHOWED HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT VALUE (P < 0.001) IN GROUP I SUBJECTS WHEN COMPARED WITH GROUP II AND GROUP III SUBJECTS. CONCLUSION: CROSS-SECTIONAL OBSERVATION DONE AMONG THREE GROUPS SHOWED THAT INDIVIDUALS PRACTICING YOGA REGULARLY HAD LOW SERUM CORTISOL LEVELS, HAM-A SCALE AND ZSDS SCORES, AND BETTER PERIODONTAL HEALTH.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
2  807  32 EFFECT OF YOGA ON ARRHYTHMIA BURDEN, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: THE YOGA MY HEART STUDY. OBJECTIVES: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (AF) BURDEN, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), DEPRESSION, AND ANXIETY SCORES. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS KNOWN TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT ON CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH. THE EFFECT OF YOGA IN REDUCING AF BURDEN IS UNKNOWN. METHODS: THIS SINGLE-CENTER, PRE-POST STUDY ENROLLED PATIENTS WITH SYMPTOMATIC PAROXYSMAL AF WITH AN INITIAL 3-MONTH NONINTERVENTIONAL OBSERVATION PERIOD FOLLOWED BY TWICE-WEEKLY 60-MIN YOGA TRAINING FOR NEXT 3 MONTHS. AF EPISODES DURING THE CONTROL AND STUDY PERIODS AS WELL AS SF-36, ZUNG SELF-RATED ANXIETY, AND ZUNG SELF-RATED DEPRESSION SCORES AT BASELINE, BEFORE, AND AFTER THE STUDY PHASE WERE ASSESSED. RESULTS: YOGA TRAINING REDUCED SYMPTOMATIC AF EPISODES (3.8 +/- 3 VS. 2.1 +/- 2.6, P < 0.001), SYMPTOMATIC NON-AF EPISODES (2.9 +/- 3.4 VS. 1.4 +/- 2.0; P < 0.001), ASYMPTOMATIC AF EPISODES (0.12 +/- 0.44 VS. 0.04 +/- 0.20; P < 0.001), AND DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY (P < 0.001), AND IMPROVED THE QOL PARAMETERS OF PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING, GENERAL HEALTH, VITALITY, SOCIAL FUNCTIONING, AND MENTAL HEALTH DOMAINS ON SF-36 (P = 0.017, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P = 0.019, AND P < 0.001, RESPECTIVELY). THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN HEART RATE, AND SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: IN PATIENTS WITH PAROXYSMAL AF, YOGA IMPROVES SYMPTOMS, ARRHYTHMIA BURDEN, HEART RATE, BLOOD PRESSURE, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCORES, AND SEVERAL DOMAINS OF QOL.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
3  325  43 ANTI-ANXIETY EFFICACY OF SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA IN GENERAL ANXIETY DISORDER: A MULTICOMPONENT, YOGA BASED, BREATH INTERVENTION PROGRAM FOR PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER WITH OR WITHOUT COMORBIDITIES. BACKGROUND: SURDASHAN KRIYA YOGA (SKY) IS A PROCEDURE THAT IN VARIOUS STUDIES, HAS SHOWN EVIDENCES OF EFFICACY IN ALLEVIATING DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY DISORDERS, BUT IN EUROPE AND USA IT HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED YET ON A CAUCASIAN POPULATION AS AN ADJUNCT THERAPY FOR PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS. METHODS: THE STUDY INVOLVED A SAMPLE OF CONSENTING WOMEN AND MEN (N = 69) WHO RECEIVED SKY THERAPY FOR A SIX-MONTH TIME PERIOD. THEY WERE ASSESSED AT RECRUITMENT, AFTER TWO WEEKS, AFTER THREE MONTHS AND AFTER SIX MONTHS USING HAMILTON RATING SCALE FOR ANXIETY (HRSA), HAMILTON RATING SCALE FOR DEPRESSION (HRSD), ZUNG SELF-RATING ANXIETY SCALE (ZSAS), ZUNG SELF-RATING DEPRESSION SCALE (ZSDS) AND SYMPTOM CHECKLIST-90 (SCL-90). RESULTS: ALL THE ANALYSES HAVE SHOWN THAT SKY THERAPY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES THE SCORES OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. THIS IS PLAIN, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE INITIAL SKY TREATMENT, WHICH IS FOLLOWED BY A LONG PLATEAU PHASE THAT SEEMS TO VERGE ON NO ANXIETY/DEPRESSION SCORES. IT WAS FOUND THAT SKY EFFECTS LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT CONVERGENCE BETWEEN THE SELF-ASSESSMENT (ZUNG SELF-RATING SCALE) AND HETERO-ASSESSMENT (HAMILTON RATING SCALE). LIMITATIONS: THE STUDY SHOULD BE REPLICATED ON A LARGER CLINICAL SAMPLE IN A CONTROLLED TRIAL TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SKY PROTOCOL. CONCLUSIONS: PARTICIPATION IN SKY ADJUNCT THERAPY TEN DAYS INTENSE WORKSHOP AND FOLLOW-UPS, COUPLED WITH DAILY INDIVIDUAL AND INDEPENDENT PRACTICE OF A SIMPLIFIED PROTOCOL OF BREATHING TECHNIQUES (30 MIN), CAN LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN LEVELS OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
4  920  41 EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AND EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION ON DISABILITY, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND PAIN IN PEOPLE WITH CLBP: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: THE CURRENT STUDY INVESTIGATES THE EFFECTS OF AN 8-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM WITH EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION COMPARED WITH AN INFORMATIONAL PAMPHLET ON DISABILITY, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND PAIN, IN PEOPLE AFFECTED BY CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP). METHODS: THIRTY INDIVIDUALS (AGE 34.2+/-4.52YRS) WITH CLBP WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED INTO A YOGA GROUP (YG, N=15) AND A PAMPHLET GROUP (PG, N=15). THE YG PARTICIPATED IN AN 8-WEEK (2 DAYS PER WEEK) YOGA PROGRAM WHICH INCLUDED EDUCATION ON SPINE ANATOMY/BIOMECHANICS AND THE MANAGEMENT OF CLBP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: MONITORING RESPONSE TO INTERVENTION, THE OSWESTRY LOW BACK PAIN DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE (ODI-I), ZUNG SELF-RATING DEPRESSION SCALE (SDS), ZUNG SELF-RATING ANXIETY SCALE (SAS) AND NUMERIC RATING SCALE FOR PAIN (NRS 0-10) WERE USED TO COLLECT DATA. RESULTS: AFTER INTERVENTION, THE YG SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE (P<0.05) IN THE MEAN SCORE IN ALL ASSESSED VARIABLES WHEN COMPARED WITH BASELINE DATA. IN ADDITION, STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P<0.05) DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED AMONG GROUPS AT THE END OF INTERVENTION IN DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND PAIN, BUT NOT IN DISABILITY. CONCLUSIONS: THE YOGA PROGRAM AND EDUCATION TOGETHER APPEAR TO BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, WHICH CAN AFFECT PERCEPTION OF PAIN.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
5 1409  55 IMPACT OF YOGA ON PERIODONTAL DISEASE AND STRESS MANAGEMENT. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS CONSIDERED TO BE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT, EFFECTIVE, AND VALUABLE TOOLS AVAILABLE FOR MAN TO OVERCOME VARIOUS PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS. STRESS CONTRIBUTES SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE PATHOGENESIS OF PERIODONTAL DISEASES; HENCE, IT BECOMES IMPORTANT TO REDUCE THE LEVEL OF STRESS FOR PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF DISEASES. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: THE PRESENT STUDY WAS AIMED: (1) TO UNDERSTAND AND ANALYZE THE POSSIBILITIES OF EMPLOYING YOGIC PRACTICES IN THE TREATMENT OF PERIODONTAL DISEASE ALONG WITH CONVENTIONAL DENTAL THERAPY, (2) TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECT OF STRESS ON PERIODONTAL TREATMENT OUTCOME, (3) TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PERIODONTAL DISEASE WITH REFERENCE TO STRESS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AN OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENT-BASED PARALLEL GROUP RANDOMIZED STUDY WAS PERFORMED WITH STANDARD TREATMENT FOR PERIODONTAL DISEASE YOGA THERAPY AS GROUP II AND ONLY STANDARD TREATMENT AS GROUP I. PERIODONTAL HEALTH STATUS WAS RECORDED USING INDICES OF MODIFIED PLAQUE INDEX (PI), BLEEDING ON PROBING (BOP), PROBING DEPTH, AND CLINICAL ATTACHMENT LOSS (CAL). THE COHEN'S PERCEIVED STRESS QUESTIONNAIRE WAS ALSO USED TO DETERMINE STRESS SEVERITY. THE YOGIC INTERVENTION CONSISTS OF LECTURES AND PRACTICAL SESSIONS ON ASANAS, PRANAYAMA, KRIYAS, AND MEDITATION. RESULTS: REPEATED MEASURE ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE (P < 0.001) IN ALL THE OUTCOME VARIABLES WITH RESPECT TO TIME IN BOTH GROUPS. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT MEAN PI SCORE REDUCED BY 1.35 IN GROUP II AS COMPARED TO 0.54 IN GROUP I, MEAN PROBING POCKET DEPTH REDUCED BY 1.60 IN GROUP II AS COMPARED TO ONLY 0.68 IN GROUP I, AND MEAN CAL SCORE REDUCED BY 1.60 IN GROUP II AS COMPARED TO 0.68 IN GROUP I. SIMILARLY, COHEN'S PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE SCORE ALSO REDUCED BY 18.76 POINTS IN GROUP II AS COMPARED TO ONLY 2.58 POINTS IN GROUP I, BOP ALSO SHOWS BETTER IMPROVEMENT IN GROUP II WITH A REDUCTION OF 0.68 AS COMPARED TO REDUCTION OF ONLY 0.08 IN GROUP I. THE RESULTS OBTAINED ASCERTAINED THE ROLE OF YOGA IN STRESS REDUCTION IN PERIODONTAL DISEASE. CONCLUSION: ALTHOUGH YOGA DOES NOT PLAY A DIRECT ROLE IN IMPROVING PERIODONTAL DISEASE, IT ACCELERATES THE TREATMENT OUTCOMES BY COMBATING THE STRESS WHICH IS A MAJOR FACTOR AFFECTING THE TREATMENT OF PERIODONTAL DISEASE.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
6 1039  35 EFFECTS OF YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION - A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. BACKGROUND: PATIENTS WITH ATRIAL FIBRILLATION OFTEN HAVE AN IMPAIRED QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). PRACTISING YOGA MAY DECREASE STRESS AND HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER YOGA CAN IMPROVE QOL AND DECREASE BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEART RATE IN PATIENTS WITH PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION (PAF). METHODS: IN THIS PILOT STUDY, 80 PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH PAF WERE RANDOMIZED TO STANDARD TREATMENT (CONTROL GROUP, N=40) OR STANDARD TREATMENT IN COMBINATION WITH YOGA (YOGA GROUP, N=40) DURING A 12-WEEK PERIOD. QOL, BLOOD PRESSURE AND HEART RATE WERE EVALUATED AT BASELINE AND AT THE END OF THE STUDY (12 (+2) WEEKS). EUROQOL-5D (EQ-5D) VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS) AND THE TWO DIMENSIONS IN SHORT-FORM HEALTH SURVEY (SF-36) WERE USED TO EVALUATE QOL. RESULTS: AT BASELINE THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN QOL BETWEEN THE GROUPS IN EQ-5D VAS- SCALE ( P=0.02) AND SF-36 MENTAL HEALTH SCORE ( P<0.001) IN WHICH THE CONTROL GROUP HAD HIGHER SCORES. AT THE END OF THE STUDY, THE YOGA GROUP AVERAGED HIGHER SF-36 MENTAL HEALTH SCORES. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS ( P=0.016), BUT NO DIFFERENCES IN EQ-5D VAS- SCALE AND PHYSIOLOGICAL HEALTH SCORE WAS SEEN BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. AT THE END OF THE STUDY, THE YOGA GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER HEART RATE ( P=0.024) AND SYSTOLIC ( P=0.033) AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE ( P<0.001) COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA WITH LIGHT MOVEMENTS AND DEEP BREATHING MAY LEAD TO IMPROVED QOL, LOWER BLOOD PRESSURE AND LOWER HEART RATE IN PATIENTS WITH PAF COMPARED TO A CONTROL GROUP. YOGA COULD BE A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT METHOD TO STANDARD THERAPY.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
7  389  33 BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN HEART FAILURE PATIENTS. BACKGROUND: THE NUMBER OF AFRICAN AMERICAN (AA) PATIENTS LIVING WITH HEART FAILURE (HF) HAS BEEN INCREASING, ESPECIALLY AMONG THE ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED. YOGA THERAPY HAS BEEN FOUND TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS AMONG HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS, BUT ITS EFFECT IN PATIENTS WITH HF REMAINS UNKNOWN. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY ON CARDIOVASCULAR ENDURANCE (VO2PEAK), FLEXIBILITY, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), AND INFLAMMATORY MARKERS ON MEDICALLY STABLE HF PATIENTS. METHODS: FORTY PATIENTS (38 AA, 1 ASIAN, AND 1 CAUCASIAN) WITH SYSTOLIC OR DIASTOLIC HF WERE RANDOMIZED TO THE YOGA GROUP (YG, N = 21) OR THE CONTROL GROUP (CG, N = 19). ALL PATIENTS WERE ASKED TO FOLLOW A HOME WALK PROGRAM. PREMEASUREMENT AND POSTMEASUREMENT INCLUDED A TREADMILL STRESS TEST TO PEAK EXERTION, FLEXIBILITY, INTERLEUKIN-6 (IL-6), C-REACTIVE PROTEIN (CRP), AND EXTRACELLULAR SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE (EC-SOD). QOL WAS ASSESSED BY THE MINNESOTA LIVING WITH HEART FAILURE QUESTIONNAIRE (MLWHFQ). RESULTS: THE STATISTICAL ANALYSES (ASSESSED BY ANOVA AND T-TESTS) WERE SIGNIFICANT FOR FAVORABLE CHANGES IN THE YG, COMPARED WITH THOSE IN THE CG, FOR FLEXIBILITY (P = 0.012), TREADMILL TIME (P = 0.002), VO2PEAK (P = 0.003), AND THE BIOMARKERS (IL-6, P = 0.004; CRP, P = 0.016; AND EC-SOD, P = 0.012). WITHIN THE YG, PRETEST TO POSTTEST SCORES FOR THE TOTAL (P = 0.02) AND PHYSICAL SUBSCALES (P < 0.001) OF THE MLWHFQ WERE IMPROVED. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA THERAPY OFFERED ADDITIONAL BENEFITS TO THE STANDARD MEDICAL CARE OF PREDOMINANTLY AA HF PATIENTS BY IMPROVING CARDIOVASCULAR ENDURANCE, QOL, INFLAMMATORY MARKERS, AND FLEXIBILITY.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
8  327  37 ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFICACY OF SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA (SKY) IN MELANCHOLIA: A RANDOMIZED COMPARISON WITH ELECTROCONVULSIVE THERAPY (ECT) AND IMIPRAMINE. BACKGROUND: SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA (SKY) IS A PROCEDURE THAT INVOLVES ESSENTIALLY RHYTHMIC HYPERVENTILATION AT DIFFERENT RATES OF BREATHING. THE ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFICACY OF SKY WAS DEMONSTRATED IN DYSTHYMIA IN A PROSPECTIVE, OPEN CLINICAL TRIAL. THIS STUDY COMPARED THE RELATIVE ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFICACY OF SKY IN MELANCHOLIA WITH TWO OF THE CURRENT STANDARD TREATMENTS, ELECTROCONVULSIVE THERAPY (ECT) AND IMIPRAMINE (IMN). METHODS: CONSENTING, UNTREATED MELANCHOLIC DEPRESSIVES (N=45) WERE HOSPITALIZED AND RANDOMIZED EQUALLY INTO THREE TREATMENT GROUPS. THEY WERE ASSESSED AT RECRUITMENT AND WEEKLY THEREAFTER FOR FOUR WEEKS. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN THE TOTAL SCORES ON BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY (BDI) AND HAMILTON RATING SCALE FOR DEPRESSION (HRSD) OCCURRED ON SUCCESSIVE OCCASIONS IN ALL THREE GROUPS. THE GROUPS, HOWEVER, DID NOT DIFFER. SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION BETWEEN THE GROUPS AND OCCASION OF ASSESSMENT OCCURRED. AT WEEK THREE, THE SKY GROUP HAD HIGHER SCORES THAN THE ECT GROUP BUT WAS NOT DIFFERENT FROM THE IMN GROUP. REMISSION (TOTAL HRSD SCORE OF SEVEN OR LESS) RATES AT THE END OF THE TRIAL WERE 93, 73 AND 67% IN THE ECT, IMN AND SKY GROUPS, RESPECTIVELY. NO CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT SIDE EFFECTS WERE OBSERVED. DISCUSSION: WITHIN THE LIMITATIONS OF THE DESIGN (LACK OF DOUBLE BLIND CONDITIONS), IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT, ALTHOUGH INFERIOR TO ECT, SKY CAN BE A POTENTIAL ALTERNATIVE TO DRUGS IN MELANCHOLIA AS A FIRST LINE TREATMENT.	2000	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
9 2507  42 YOGA BASED CARDIAC REHABILITATION AFTER CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS SURGERY: ONE-YEAR RESULTS ON LVEF, LIPID PROFILE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STATES--A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO COMPARE THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA BASED CARDIAC REHABILITATION PROGRAM WITH ONLY PHYSIOTHERAPY BASED PROGRAM AS AN ADD-ON TO CONVENTIONAL REHABILITATION AFTER CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING (CABG) ON RISK FACTORS. METHODS: IN THIS SINGLE BLIND PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED PARALLEL TWO ARMED ACTIVE CONTROL STUDY, 1026 PATIENTS POSTED FOR CABG AT NARAYANA HRUDAYALAYA INSTITUTE OF CARDIAC SCIENCES, BENGALURU (INDIA) WERE SCREENED. OF THESE, 250 MALE PARTICIPANTS (35-65 YEARS) WHO SATISFIED THE SELECTION CRITERIA AND CONSENTED WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS. WITHIN AND BETWEEN GROUP COMPARISONS WERE DONE AT THREE POINTS OF FOLLOW UP (I.E. 6TH WEEK, 6TH MONTH, AND 12TH MONTH) BY USING WILCOXON'S SIGNED RANKS TEST AND MANN WHITNEY U TEST RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS: YOGA GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY (P = 0.001, MANN WHITNEY) BETTER IMPROVEMENT IN LVEF THAN CONTROL GROUP IN THOSE WITH ABNORMAL BASELINE EF (<53%) AFTER 1 YEAR. THERE WAS A BETTER REDUCTION IN BMI IN THE YOGA GROUP (P = 0.038, BETWEEN GROUPS) IN THOSE WITH HIGH BASELINE BMI (>/=23) AFTER 12 MONTHS. YOGA GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT (P = 0.008, WILCOXON'S) REDUCTION IN BLOOD GLUCOSE AT ONE YEAR IN THOSE WITH HIGH BASELINE FBS >/=110 MG/DL. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER IMPROVEMENT IN YOGA THAN THE CONTROL GROUP IN HDL (P = 0.003), LDL (P = 0.01) AND VLDL (P = 0.03) IN THOSE WITH ABNORMAL BASELINE VALUES. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER IMPROVEMENT (P = 0.02, BETWEEN GROUPS) IN POSITIVE AFFECT IN YOGA GROUP. WITHIN YOGA GROUP, THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN PERCEIVED STRESS (P = 0.001), ANXIETY (P = 0.001), DEPRESSION (P = 0.001), AND NEGATIVE AFFECT (P = 0.03) WHILE IN THE CONTROL GROUP THERE WAS REDUCTION (P = 0.003) ONLY IN SCORES ON ANXIETY. CONCLUSION: ADDITION OF YOGA BASED RELAXATION TO CONVENTIONAL POST-CABG CARDIAC REHABILITATION HELPS IN BETTER MANAGEMENT OF RISK FACTORS IN THOSE WITH ABNORMAL BASELINE VALUES AND MAY HELP IN PREVENTING RECURRENCE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
10 1600  29 MEDIYOGA AS A PART OF A SELF-MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME AMONG PATIENTS WITH PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION - A RANDOMISED STUDY. BACKGROUND: PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPAIRED HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE. YOGA HAS BEEN SUGGESTED TO IMPROVE HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG PATIENTS WITH HEART FAILURE AND HYPERTENSION. AIM: THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF MEDIYOGA, IN RESPECT OF HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, BLOOD PRESSURE, HEART RATE, AS WELL AS N-TERMINAL PRO B-TYPE NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE, AMONG PATIENTS WITH SYMPTOMATIC PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, COMPARED WITH STANDARD THERAPY OR RELAXATION. METHODS: PATIENTS WITH SYMPTOMATIC PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, N=132, WERE STRATIFIED FOR GENDER AND RANDOMISED TO MEDIYOGA, A RELAXATION GROUP OR A CONTROL GROUP, 44 PATIENTS PER GROUP WITH A 12-WEEK FOLLOW-UP. HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, BLOOD PRESSURE, HEART RATE AND N-TERMINAL PRO B-TYPE NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE WERE ASSESSED. RESULTS: AFTER 12 WEEKS, THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES IN HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE BETWEEN THE GROUPS. THERE WERE IMPROVEMENTS IN SHORT-FORM HEALTH SURVEY BODILY PAIN, GENERAL HEALTH, SOCIAL FUNCTION, MENTAL HEALTH AND MENTAL COMPONENT SUMMARY SCORES WITHIN THE MEDIYOGA GROUP (P=0.014, P=0.037, P=0.029, P=0.030, P=0.019, RESPECTIVELY). NO CHANGE WAS SEEN IN THE RELAXATION AND CONTROL GROUPS. SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE DECREASED IN THE MEDIYOGA GROUP (134+/-18 TO 127+/-13) COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP (126+/-17 TO 127+/-15, P=0.041); NO DIFFERENCE COMPARED WITH THE RELAXATION GROUP (131+/-17 TO 125+/-12). DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE DECREASED IN THE MEDIYOGA GROUP (79+/-9 TO 74 +/-9) COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP (76+/-9 TO 79+/-8, P=0.005); NO DIFFERENCE COMPARED WITH THE RELAXATION GROUP (76+/-9 TO 77+/-8). THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES IN HEART RATE AND N-TERMINAL PRO B-TYPE NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE BETWEEN THE GROUPS AFTER 12 WEEKS. CONCLUSIONS: MEDIYOGA IMPROVES HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE AND DECREASES BLOOD PRESSURE IN PATIENTS WITH PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION. MEDIYOGA MAY BE USED AS A PART OF A SELF-MANAGEMENT PROGRAMME AMONG PATIENTS WITH PAROXYSMAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
11  762  38 EFFECT OF SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA ON ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PEOPLE WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES: A PILOT STUDY IN KUWAIT. AIM: THIS PILOT STUDY IN KUWAIT WAS AIMED TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA (SKY) ON ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND TOTAL QUALITY OF LIFE IN PEOPLE WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM). METHODS: 26 T2DM PATIENTS AGED GREATER THAN 30, MALE AND FEMALE VISITING THE OUTPATIENT CLINIC OF DASMAN DIABETES INSTITUTE WERE ENROLLED FOR THE STUDY. PRE AND POST 5 DAY SKY INTERVENTION RESPONSES OF PARTICIPANTS ON PSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS WERE EVALUATED USING FOUR QUESTIONNAIRES (HAMILTON ANXIETY, PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE (PHQ-9), HOSPITAL ANXIETY DEPRESSION AND WHO TOTAL QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS; SUCH AS LIPID PROFILE, GLYCATED HEMOGLOBIN (HBA1C) WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE AND AFTER 15 WEEKS OF SKY PRACTICE. RESULTS: THE MEAN AGE OF THE PARTICIPANTS WAS 56.7 (+/-11.4 SD) YEARS, AND MEAN DURATION OF DIABETES 15.0 (+/-9.3 SD) YEARS. COMPARISON OF RESPONSES BEFORE AND AFTER INTERVENTION INDICATED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE QOL, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY AND INSOMNIA. BUT NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN GLYCEMIC CONTROL. CONCLUSION: RESULTS INDICATE THAT SKY CAN BE POTENTIALLY BENEFICIAL FOR TREATING ANXIETY, INSOMNIA, AND DEPRESSION ASSOCIATED IN PEOPLE WITH T2DM AND IN IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN PEOPLE WITH T2DM.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
12  772  39 EFFECT OF YOGA AND EXERCISE ON GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL PARAMETERS IN TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. CONTEXT BACKGROUND: TYPE 2 DIABETES HAS BEEN STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS SUCH AS STRESS, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). THERE IS NOT MUCH EVIDENCE WHETHER YOGA CAN IMPROVE THESE FACTORS AND MOTIVATE INDIVIDUALS TO ENGAGE IN ACTIVE LIFESTYLE. AIMS: THIS STUDY AIMS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA AND EXERCISE OVER GLYCEMIC CONTROL, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, EXERCISE SELF-EFFICACY (ESE), AND QOL AFTER 3-MONTH PROGRAM. METHODS: TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY-SEVEN INDIVIDUALS WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO YOGA GROUP (YG) AND EXERCISE GROUP. YG PRACTICED YOGA FOR 2 WEEKS UNDER SUPERVISION AND THEN CARRIED OUT PRACTICE AT HOME FOR 3 MONTHS. THE EXERCISE GROUP PRACTICED 30 MIN OF BRISK WALKING FOR 5 DAYS A WEEK. RESULTS: ON COMPARISON AMONG THE GROUPS, IN YG, THERE WAS A MEAN CHANGE OF 0.47 IN GLYCATED HEMOGLOBIN WHICH WAS GREATER THAN MEAN REDUCTION OF 0.28 IN THE EXERCISE GROUP WITH P < 0.05. STATE ANXIETY REDUCED BY 7.8 AND TRAIT ANXIETY REDUCED BY 4.4 IN YG (P < 0.05) IN 3 MONTHS AS COMPARED TO NONSIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS OF 3 AND 1 IN MEAN OF STATE AND TRAIT ANXIETY SCORES IN THE EXERCISE GROUP (P > 0.05). THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DEPRESSION SCORE IN BOTH THE GROUPS, 8.6 IN YOGA AND 4.0 IN EXERCISE, WHICH WAS GREATER IN YG. ESE IMPROVED BY 19.2 IN YG (P < 0.05), WHEREAS IT IMPROVED ONLY 2.2 IN THE EXERCISE GROUP (P > 0.05). QOL IMPROVED BY 23.7 IN YG AND 3.0 IN THE EXERCISE GROUP WHICH WAS NONSIGNIFICANT IN THE EXERCISE GROUP AS COMPARED TO YG. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA IS SUPERIOR TO EXERCISE ALONE AS A LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION PROGRAM IN IMPROVING GLYCEMIC CONTROL, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND QOL AS WELL AS ESE.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
13 2250  45 THE LONGITUDINAL EFFECTS OF SEATED ISOMETRIC YOGA ON BLOOD BIOMARKERS, AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS OF PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: IN A PREVIOUS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, WE FOUND THAT PRACTICING SEATED ISOMETRIC YOGA REGULARLY FOR 2 MONTHS IMPROVED THE FATIGUE OF PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME (CFS) WHO ARE RESISTANT TO CONVENTIONAL THERAPY. THE AIM OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE POSSIBLE MECHANISMS BEHIND THIS FINDING BY COMPARING BLOOD BIOMARKERS, AUTONOMIC NERVOUS FUNCTION, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL INDICES BEFORE VERSUS AFTER AN INTERVENTION PERIOD OF SEATED ISOMETRIC YOGA PRACTICE. METHODS: FIFTEEN PATIENTS WITH CFS WHO DID NOT SHOW SATISFACTORY IMPROVEMENTS AFTER AT LEAST 6 MONTHS OF CONVENTIONAL THERAPY PRACTICED SEATED ISOMETRIC YOGA (BIWEEKLY 20-MIN SESSIONS WITH A YOGA INSTRUCTOR AND DAILY PRACTICE AT HOME) FOR 2 MONTHS. THE LONGITUDINAL EFFECTS OF SEATED ISOMETRIC YOGA ON FATIGUE, BLOOD BIOMARKERS, AUTONOMIC FUNCTION, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE WERE INVESTIGATED BY COMPARING THE FOLLOWING PARAMETERS BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION PERIOD: FATIGUE SEVERITY WAS ASSESSED BY THE CHALDER FATIGUE SCALE (FS) SCORE. LEVELS OF THE BLOOD BIOMARKERS CORTISOL, DHEA-S, TNF-ALPHA, IL-6, PROLACTIN, CARNITINE, TGF-BETA1, BDNF, MHPG, HVA, AND ALPHA-MSH WERE MEASURED. THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS FUNCTIONS ASSESSED WERE HEART RATE (HR) AND HR VARIABILITY. PSYCHOLOGICAL INDICES INCLUDED THE 20-ITEM TORONTO ALEXITHYMIA SCALE (TAS-20) AND THE HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE (HADS). RESULTS: PRACTICING SEATED ISOMETRIC YOGA FOR 2 MONTHS RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN THE CHALDER FS (P = 0.002) AND HADS-DEPRESSION (P = 0.02) SCORES. NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE OBSERVED IN ANY OTHER PARAMETER EVALUATED. THE CHANGE IN CHALDER FS SCORE WAS NOT CORRELATED WITH THE CHANGE IN HADS-DEPRESSION SCORE. HOWEVER, THIS CHANGE WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH CHANGES IN THE SERUM TNF-ALPHA LEVELS (P = 0.048), THE HIGH FREQUENCY COMPONENT OF HR VARIABILITY (P = 0.042), AND TAS-20 SCORES (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: REGULAR PRACTICE OF SEATED ISOMETRIC YOGA FOR 2 MONTHS REDUCED THE FATIGUE AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOM SCORES OF PATIENTS WITH CFS WITHOUT AFFECTING ANY OTHER PARAMETERS WE INVESTIGATED. THIS STUDY FAILED TO IDENTIFY THE MARKERS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LONGITUDINAL FATIGUE-RELIEVING EFFECT OF SEATED ISOMETRIC YOGA. HOWEVER, CONSIDERING THAT THE REDUCED FATIGUE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED SERUM TNF-ALPHA LEVEL AND TAS-20 SCORES, FATIGUE IMPROVEMENT MIGHT BE RELATED TO REDUCED INFLAMMATION AND IMPROVED ALEXITHYMIA IN THESE PATIENTS.

14 1130  29 EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR DEPRESSED POSTPARTUM WOMEN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: UP TO 20% OF WOMEN EXPERIENCE POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION (PPD). PPD IS ASSOCIATED WITH ANXIETY AND POOR HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL). EFFICACIOUS TREATMENTS ARE CRITICAL; MANY WOMEN WITH PPD PREFER COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES. THUS, THE CURRENT STUDY EXAMINED YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR PPD. METHODS: FIFTY-SEVEN POSTPARTUM WOMEN WITH SCORES >/=12 ON THE HAMILTON DEPRESSION RATING SCALE WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A YOGA (N = 28) OR WAIT-LIST CONTROL (N = 29) GROUP. THE YOGA INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF 16 CLASSES OVER 8 WEEKS. OUTCOMES WERE DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND HRQOL. RESULTS: THE YOGA GROUP EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER RATE OF IMPROVEMENT IN DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND HRQOL, RELATIVE TO THE CONTROL GROUP WITH MODERATE TO LARGE EFFECTS. RELIABLE CHANGE INDEX ANALYSES REVEALED THAT 78% OF WOMEN IN THE YOGA GROUP EXPERIENCED CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. CONCLUSION: THESE FINDINGS SUPPORT YOGA AS A PROMISING COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR PPD, AND WARRANT LARGE-SCALE REPLICATION STUDIES.

15  871  34 EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY ON DISEASE ACTIVITY, INFLAMMATORY MARKERS, AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY IN PATIENTS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. BACKGROUND: RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA) IS AN IMMUNE-MEDIATED INFLAMMATORY DISEASE. ANTIRHEUMATOID TREATMENT REDUCES DISEASE ACTIVITY AND INFLAMMATION, BUT NOT ALL PATIENTS RESPOND TO TREATMENT. AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION IS COMMON IN RA LEADING TO FREQUENT CARDIOVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS. YOGA THERAPY MAY BE USEFUL IN THESE PATIENTS, BUT THERE ARE LITTLE DATA ON THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON DISEASE ACTIVITY, INFLAMMATORY MARKERS, AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV). OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY ASSESSED THE EFFECT OF 12-WEEK YOGA THERAPY ON DISEASE ACTIVITY, INFLAMMATORY MARKERS, AND HRV IN PATIENTS WITH RA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED ON NEWLY DIAGNOSED RA PATIENTS ATTENDING OUTPATIENT SERVICES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY, JIPMER. ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY-SIX PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS: THE CONTROL GROUP (CG) (N = 83) AND YOGA GROUP (YG) (N = 83). YOGA THERAPY WAS ADMINISTERED TO PARTICIPANTS IN THE YG FOR 12 WEEKS, ALONG WITH STANDARD MEDICAL TREATMENT. THE CG RECEIVED ONLY STANDARD MEDICAL TREATMENT. PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE DISEASE ACTIVITY SCORE 28, INTERLEUKIN-1ALPHA (IL-1ALPHA), IL-6, TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR-ALPHA (TNF-ALPHA), CORTISOL, AND HRV PARAMETERS. ALL PARAMETERS WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE AND AFTER 12 WEEKS. RESULTS: DISEASE ACTIVITY SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED IN BOTH GROUPS AFTER 12 WEEKS, BUT IT WAS REDUCED MORE IN YG, WHICH WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.05). IN BOTH YG AND CG, IL-1ALPHA, IL-6, TNF-ALPHA, AND CORTISOL DECREASED AFTER 12 WEEKS, BUT IL-1ALPHA AND CORTISOL DECREASED MORE SIGNIFICANTLY IN YG THAN IN CG. LOW-FREQUENCY COMPONENT EXPRESSED AS NORMALIZED UNIT (LFNU) AND THE LOW-FREQUENCY/HIGH-FREQUENCY (LF-HF) RATIO DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY, AND TOTAL POWER AND HF COMPONENT EXPRESSED AS NORMALIZED UNIT (HFNU) INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE YG COMPARED WITH CG. CONCLUSION: TWELVE-WEEK YOGA THERAPY, IF GIVEN ALONG WITH STANDARD MEDICAL TREATMENT, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES DISEASE ACTIVITY AND IMPROVES SYMPATHOVAGAL BALANCE IN RA PATIENTS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
16  326  32 ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFICACY AND HORMONAL EFFECTS OF SUDARSHANA KRIYA YOGA (SKY) IN ALCOHOL DEPENDENT INDIVIDUALS. BACKGROUND: SUDARSHANA KRIYA YOGA (SKY) HAS DEMONSTRABLE ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFECTS. SKY WAS TESTED FOR THIS EFFECT IN INPATIENTS OF ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE. METHODS: FOLLOWING A WEEK OF DETOXIFICATION MANAGEMENT CONSENTING SUBJECTS (N=60) WERE EQUALLY RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE SKY THERAPY OR NOT (CONTROLS) FOR A TWO-WEEK STUDY. SKY THERAPY INCLUDED ALTERNATE DAY PRACTICE OF SPECIFIED BREATHING EXERCISE UNDER SUPERVISION OF A TRAINED THERAPIST. SUBJECTS COMPLETED THE BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY (BDI) BEFORE AND AFTER THE TWO WEEKS OF THIS INTERVENTION. MORNING PLASMA CORTISOL, ACTH AND PROLACTIN TOO WERE MEASURED BEFORE AND AT THE END OF TWO WEEKS. RESULTS: IN BOTH GROUPS REDUCTIONS IN BDI SCORES OCCURRED BUT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE SO IN SKY GROUP. LIKEWISE, IN BOTH GROUPS PLASMA CORTISOL AS WELL AS ACTH FELL AFTER TWO WEEKS BUT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE SO IN SKY GROUP. REDUCTION IN BDI SCORES CORRELATED WITH THAT IN CORTISOL IN SKY BUT NOT IN CONTROL GROUP. LIMITATIONS: ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFECTS OF SKY WERE DEMONSTRATED IN EARLY ABSTINENCE THAT ALSO HAD SUBSTANTIAL SPONTANEOUS IMPROVEMENT. IT IS NOT KNOWN IF THIS EFFECT CONTRIBUTES TO SUSTAINED ABSTINENCE. CONCLUSION: RESULTS EXTEND THE ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFECTS OF SKY IN ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE SUBJECTS. REDUCTION IN STRESS-HORMONE LEVELS (CORTISOL AND ACTH) ALONG WITH BDI REDUCTIONS POSSIBLY SUPPORT A BIOLOGICAL MECHANISM OF SKY IN PRODUCING BENEFICIAL EFFECTS.	2006	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
17 2725  43 YOGA NIDRA AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IN PATIENTS WITH MENSTRUAL DISORDER. BACKGROUND: EMOTIONAL INSECURITY, STRESS, DEPRESSIVE OR/AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS ARE COMMON WITH VARIABLE SEVERITY AMONG PATIENTS WITH MENSTRUAL DISORDER. YOGIC RELAXATION THERAPY (YOGA NIDRA) LEADS TO CONSCIOUS AND SUBCONSCIOUS RECOGNITION OF THESE UNDERLYING PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS AND HELPS RELEASING OF SUPPRESSED CONFLICTS. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA NIDRA ON ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IN PATIENTS WITH MENSTRUAL DISORDERS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SUBJECTS WERE RECRUITED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY, C.S.M. MEDICAL UNIVERSITY (ERSTWHILE KGMU), LUCKNOW UTTAR PRADESH, INDIA. THE SUBJECTS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED IN TO TWO GROUPS: INTERVENTION GROUP (WITH YOGIC INTERVENTION) AND CONTROL GROUP (WITHOUT YOGIC INTERVENTION). ASSESSMENTS OF ALL SUBJECTS WERE CARRIED OUT BY ADMINISTERING HAMILTON ANXIETY SCALE (HAM-A) AND HAMILTON RATING SCALE FOR DEPRESSION (HAM-D) AT BASELINE AND AFTER SIX MONTHS. RESULTS: THE MEAN AGE WITH S.D OF THE INTERVENTION GROUP WAS 27.67 +/- 7.85 YEARS, AND FOR CONTROL GROUP WAS 26.58 +/- 6.87 YEARS (AMONG COMPLETED INTERVENTION GROUP NN = 65 AND CONTROL GROUP NN = 61). THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF SCORES IN HAM-A (P<0.003) AND HAM-D (P<0.02) RESPECTIVELY IN SUBJECTS WITH MILD TO MODERATE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AFTER SIX MONTHS OF YOGA THERAPY (YOGA NIDRA) IN INTERVENTION GROUP IN COMPARISON TO CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: THE PATIENTS WITH MILD TO MODERATE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IMPROVE SIGNIFICANTLY WITH 'YOGA NIDRA' INTERVENTION. THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE PATIENTS WITH SEVERE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
18  707  43 EFFECT OF INTEGRATED YOGA (IY) ON PSYCHOLOGICAL STATES AND CD4 COUNTS OF HIV-1 INFECTED PATIENTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) INFECTED INDIVIDUALS FREQUENTLY SUFFER FROM ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. DEPRESSION HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH RAPID DECLINE IN CD4 COUNTS AND WORSENED TREATMENT OUTCOMES IN HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS. YOGA HAS BEEN USED TO REDUCE PSYCHOPATHOLOGY AND IMPROVE IMMUNITY. AIM: TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF 1-MONTH INTEGRATED YOGA (IY) INTERVENTION ON ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND CD4 COUNTS IN PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM HIV-1 INFECTION. METHODS: FORTY FOUR HIV-1 INFECTED INDIVIDUALS FROM TWO HIV REHABILITATION CENTERS OF MANIPUR STATE OF INDIA WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS: YOGA (N = 22; 12 MALES) AND CONTROL (N = 22; 14 MALES). YOGA GROUP RECEIVED IY INTERVENTION, WHICH INCLUDED PHYSICAL POSTURES (ASANAS), BREATHING PRACTICES (PRANAYAMA), RELAXATION TECHNIQUES, AND MEDITATION. IY SESSIONS WERE GIVEN 60 MIN/DAY, 6 DAYS A WEEK FOR 1 MONTH. CONTROL GROUP FOLLOWED DAILY ROUTINE DURING THIS PERIOD. ALL PATIENTS WERE ON ANTI-RETROVIRAL THERAPY (ART) AND DOSAGES WERE KEPT STABLE DURING THE STUDY. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN AGE, GENDER, EDUCATION, CD4 COUNTS, AND ART STATUS BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE WAS USED TO ASSESS ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, CD4 COUNTS WERE MEASURED BY FLOW CYTOMETRY BEFORE AND AFTER INTERVENTION. ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE - REPEATED MEASURES WAS APPLIED TO ANALYZE THE DATA USING SPSS VERSION 10. RESULTS: WITHIN GROUP COMPARISON SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DEPRESSION SCORES (F [1, 21] =4.19, P < 0.05) AND NON-SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN ANXIETY SCORES ALONG WITH NON SIGNIFICANT INCREMENT IN CD4 COUNTS IN THE YOGA GROUP. IN THE CONTROL GROUP, THERE WAS A NON-SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCORES AND REDUCTION IN CD4 COUNTS. BETWEEN-GROUP COMPARISON REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DEPRESSION SCORES (F [1, 21] =5.64, P < 0.05) AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CD4 COUNTS (F [1, 21] =5.35, P < 0.05) IN THE YOGA GROUP AS COMPARED TO THE CONTROL. CONCLUSION: ONE MONTH PRACTICE OF IY MAY REDUCE DEPRESSION AND IMPROVE IMMUNITY IN HIV-1 INFECTED ADULTS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
19  190  34 A RANDOMIZED STUDY OF YOGA THERAPY FOR THE PREVENTION OF RECURRENT REFLEX VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE. AIMS: VASOVAGAL SYNCOPE (VVS) IS A COMMON CARDIOVASCULAR DYSAUTONOMIC DISORDER THAT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTS HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE A POSITIVE INFLUENCE ON CARDIOVASCULAR AUTONOMICS. THIS STUDY ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA THERAPY ON THE RECURRENCE OF VVS AND QOL. METHODS AND RESULTS: WE RANDOMIZED SUBJECTS WITH RECURRENT REFLEX VVS (>3 EPISODES IN THE PAST 1 YEAR) AND POSITIVE HEAD-UP TILT TEST TO GUIDELINE-DIRECTED THERAPY (GROUP 1) OR YOGA THERAPY (GROUP 2). PATIENTS IN GROUP 1 WERE ADVISED GUIDELINE-DIRECTED TREATMENT AND GROUP 2 WAS TAUGHT YOGA BY A CERTIFIED INSTRUCTOR. THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT WAS VVS RECURRENCES AND QOL. BETWEEN JUNE 2015 AND FEBRUARY 2017, 97 HIGHLY SYMPTOMATIC VVS PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED (GROUP 1: 47 AND GROUP 2: 50). THE MEAN AGE WAS 33.1 +/- 16.6 YEARS, MALE:FEMALE OF 40:57, SYMPTOM DURATION OF 17.1 +/- 20.7 MONTHS, WITH A MEAN OF 6.4 +/- 6.1 SYNCOPE EPISODES. OVER A FOLLOW-UP OF 14.3 +/- 2.1 MONTHS GROUP 2 HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER SYNCOPE BURDEN COMPARED WITH GROUP 1 AT 3 (0.8 +/- 0.9 VS. 1.8 +/- 1.4, P < 0.001), 6 (1.0 +/- 1.2 VS. 3.4 +/- 3.0, P < 0.001), AND AT 12 MONTHS (1.1 +/- 0.8 VS. 3.8 +/- 3.2, P < 0.001). THE SYNCOPE FUNCTIONAL SCORE QUESTIONNAIRE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN GROUP 2 COMPARED WITH GROUP 1 AT 3 (31.4 +/- 7.2 VS. 64.1 +/- 11.5, P < 0.001), 6 (26.4 +/- 6.3 VS. 61.4 +/- 10.7, P < 0.001), AND 12 MONTHS (22.2 +/- 4.7 VS. 68.3 +/- 11.4, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: FOR PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT VVS, GUIDED YOGA THERAPY IS SUPERIOR TO CONVENTIONAL THERAPY IN REDUCING SYMPTOM BURDEN AND IMPROVING QOL.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
20  820  34 EFFECT OF YOGA ON DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF MENTAL HEALTH. STATE ANXIETY, SOMATIZATION OF STRESS, QUALITY OF LIFE, SELF-RATED QUALITY OF SLEEP, AND DISCOMFORT DUE TO OVER-BREATHING WHICH OCCURS WHEN STRESSED WERE STUDIED. OUT OF A TOTAL OF 140 PARTICIPANTS, SEVENTY PARTICIPANTS SELF-SELECTED TO BE IN A YOGA GROUP FOR STRESS RELIEF (GROUP MEAN AGE +/- SD, 33.0 +/- 6.5 YEARS; 37 MALES). SEVENTY AGE AND GENDER MATCHED PARTICIPANTS WERE IN A CONTROL GROUP. STATE ANXIETY, SOMATIZATION OF STRESS, QUALITY OF LIFE, DISCOMFORT AND SELF-RATED QUALITY OF SLEEP WERE ASSESSED USING THE STATE-TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY, SYMPTOM CHECKLIST-90-R, SF-12, NIJMEGEN DISCOMFORT EVALUATION SCALE AND A SLEEP RATING QUESTIONNAIRE RESPECTIVELY. ASSESSMENTS WERE MADE AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE WEEK. REPEATED MEASURES ANOVAS WITH BONFERRONI ADJUSTED POST-HOC ANALYSES SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN STATE ANXIETY (P < 0.001), SOMATIZATION OF STRESS (P < 0.01), IMPROVED HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (P < 0.01), SELF-RATED QUALITY OF SLEEP (P < 0.01), AND DECREASE IN DISCOMFORT DUE TO OVER-BREATHING (P < 0.001). NO CHANGES (EXCEPT DECREASED DISCOMFORT DUE TO OVER-BREATHING; P < 0.01) OCCURRED IN THE CONTROL GROUP. THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT A BRIEF YOGA PROGRAM MAY BE BENEFICIAL IN DECREASING ANXIETY, SOMATIZATION OF STRESS AND DISCOMFORT, IMPROVING HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE AND SELF-RATED SLEEP QUALITY.	2012

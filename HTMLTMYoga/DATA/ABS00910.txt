1  910 180 EFFECTIVENESS OF HATHA YOGA VERSUS CONVENTIONAL THERAPEUTIC EXERCISES FOR CHRONIC NONSPECIFIC LOW-BACK PAIN. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HATHA YOGA THERAPY IS COMPARABLE TO CONVENTIONAL THERAPEUTIC EXERCISES (CTES) FOR REDUCING BACK PAIN INTENSITY AND BACK-RELATED DYSFUNCTION IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC NONSPECIFIC LOW-BACK PAIN (CNLBP). DESIGN: THE STUDY WAS A PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED COMPARATIVE TRIAL, DIVIDED INTO TWO PHASES: AN INITIAL 6-WEEKLY SUPERVISED INTERVENTION PERIOD FOLLOWED BY A 6-WEEK FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. SETTINGS: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION AND CENTRE FOR INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE AND RESEARCH OF A TERTIARY CARE HOSPITAL. SUBJECTS: PATIENTS BETWEEN 18 AND 55 YEARS OF AGE WITH COMPLAINT OF CNLBP PERSISTING >/=12 WEEKS WITH PAIN RATING >/=4 ON A NUMERICAL RATING SCALE (0-10). INTERVENTION: A TOTAL OF SIX STANDARDIZED 35-MIN WEEKLY HATHA YOGA SESSIONS (YOGA GROUP) AND SIMILARLY 35-MIN WEEKLY SESSIONS OF CTES (CTE GROUP), DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE WITH CNLBP UNACCUSTOMED TO STRUCTURED YOGA OR CTE PROGRAM. PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO PRACTICE ON NONCLASS DAYS AT HOME. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES WERE DEFENSE AND VETERANS PAIN RATING SCALE (DVPRS) (0-10) AND 24-POINT ROLAND MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE (RDQ). SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE PAIN MEDICATION USAGE PER WEEK AND A POSTINTERVENTION PERCEIVED RECOVERY (LIKERT SEVEN-POINT SCALE) OF BACK-RELATED DYSFUNCTION. OUTCOMES WERE RECORDED AT THE BASELINE, 6-WEEK FOLLOW-UP, AND 12-WEEK FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: SEVENTY SUBJECTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER YOGA (N = 35) OR CTE GROUP (N = 35). DATA WERE ANALYZED USING INTENTION-TO-TREAT, WITH LAST OBSERVATION CARRIED FORWARD. BOTH YOGA AND THE CTE GROUP HAVE SHOWN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN BACK PAIN INTENSITY AND BACK-RELATED DYSFUNCTION WITHIN BOTH THE GROUPS AT 6- AND 12-WEEK FOLLOW-UPS COMPARED TO BASELINE. NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE PAIN INTENSITY (DVPRS; AT 6 WEEKS: N = 35, DIFFERENCE OF MEDIANS 1.0, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [-5.3 TO 3.0], P = 0.5; AT 12 WEEKS: N = 35, 0.0 [-4.2 TO 5.0], 0.7) AND BACK-RELATED DYSFUNCTION (RDQ; AT 6 WEEKS: N = 35, 1.0 [-9.6 TO 10.6], 0.4; AT 12 WEEKS: N = 35, 0.0 [-8.8 TO 10.6], 0.3) WERE NOTED BETWEEN TWO GROUPS. IMPROVEMENTS IN PILL CONSUMPTION AND PERCEIVED RECOVERY WERE ALSO COMPARABLE BETWEEN THE GROUPS. CONCLUSION: YOGA PROVIDED SIMILAR IMPROVEMENT COMPARED WITH CTES, IN PATIENTS WITH CNLBP.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
2  459  49 CHANGES IN PAIN INTENSITY AND HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE WITH IYENGAR YOGA IN NONSPECIFIC CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. BACKGROUND: NONSPECIFIC CHRONIC LOW BACK (NCLBP) PAIN IS PREVALENT AMONG ADULT POPULATION AND OFTEN LEADS TO FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS, PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS, LOWER QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), AND HIGHER HEALTHCARE COSTS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF IYENGAR YOGA THERAPY ON PAIN INTENSITY AND HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) WITH NCLBP. AIM OF THE STUDY: TO COMPARE THE EFFECT OF IYENGAR YOGA THERAPY AND CONVENTIONAL EXERCISE THERAPY ON PAIN INTENSITY AND HRQOL IN NONSPECIFIC CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WITH RANDOM SAMPLING TECHNIQUE. SUBJECTS/INTERVENTION: SIXTY SUBJECTS WHO FULFILLED THE SELECTION CRITERIA WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO IYENGAR YOGA (YOGA GROUP, N = 30) AND CONTROL GROUP (EXERCISE GROUP, N = 30). PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED LOW BACK PAIN EVALUATION FORM AND HRQOL-4 QUESTIONNAIRE BEFORE THEIR INTERVENTION AND AGAIN 4 WEEKS AND 6 MONTH LATER. YOGA GROUP UNDERWENT 29 YOGIC POSTURES TRAINING AND EXERCISE GROUP HAD UNDERGONE GENERAL EXERCISE PROGRAM FOR 4 WEEKS. STATISTICS: REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA) WAS USED TO ANALYZE GROUP DIFFERENCES OVER TIME, WHILE CONTROLLING FOR BASELINE DIFFERENCES. RESULTS: PATIENTS IN BOTH GROUPS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PAIN AND IMPROVEMENT IN HRQOL. IN VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS) YOGA GROUP SHOWED REDUCTION OF 72.81% (P = 0.001) AS COMPARED TO EXERCISE GROUP 42.50% (P = 0.001). IN HRQOL, YOGA GROUP SHOWED REDUCTION OF 86.99% (P = 0.001) AS COMPARED TO EXERCISE GROUP 67.66% (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT IYENGAR YOGA PROVIDES BETTER IMPROVEMENT IN PAIN REDUCTION AND IMPROVEMENT IN HRQOL IN NONSPECIFIC CHRONIC BACK PAIN THAN GENERAL EXERCISE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
3 2653  51 YOGA IMPROVES OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE, DEPRESSION, AND DAILY ACTIVITIES FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC PAIN IS A COMPLEX ACCUMULATION OF PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS, THUS INTERVENTIONS THAT ADDRESS PAIN AND PROMOTE OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE ARE NEEDED. A HOLISTIC INTERVENTION, WITH MIND AND BODY COMPONENTS, IS LIKELY NECESSARY TO BEST TREAT THE COMPLEXITIES OF CHRONIC PAIN. THUS, WE DEVELOPED AND TESTED A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN. OBJECTIVES: IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL (RCT), PARTICIPANTS WITH CHRONIC PAIN WERE RANDOMIZED TO A YOGA INTERVENTION OR USUAL CARE GROUP. BETWEEN AND WITHIN GROUP DIFFERENCES FOR PRE-AND POST-OUTCOME MEASURE SCORES WERE ASSESSED FOR: OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE, COMPLETION OF ACTIVITIES, AND DEPRESSION. METHODS: PILOT RCT WITH PARTICIPANT ALLOCATION TO 8 WEEKS OF YOGA OR USUAL CARE. BOTH GROUPS RECEIVED ONGOING MONTHLY SELF-MANAGEMENT PROGRAMMING. DATA WERE COLLECTED BEFORE AND AFTER THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA OR USUAL CARE AFTER BASELINE ASSESSMENTS. DEMOGRAPHICS WERE COLLECTED AND MEASURES INCLUDED: CANADIAN OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE MEASURE (COPM) TO ASSESS OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE; THE 15-ITEM FRENCHAY ACTIVITIES INDEX (FAI)(ACTIVITIES); AND THE 9-ITEM PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE (PHQ-9) FOR DEPRESSION. INDEPENDENT T-TESTS WERE USED TO ASSESS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS. PAIRED T-TESTS WERE USED TO ASSESS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRE- AND POST 8-WEEK INTERVENTION FOR BOTH THE YOGA AND THE USUAL CARE GROUPS. PERCENT CHANGE SCORES AND EFFECT SIZES WERE CALCULATED. RESULTS: 83 PEOPLE WERE RECRUITED FOR THE STUDY AND COMPLETED BASELINE ASSESSMENTS; 44 INDIVIDUALS WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA AND 39 TO THE CONTROL GROUP. THE AVERAGE AGE OF ALL PARTICIPANTS WAS 51.4+/-10.5 YEARS, 68% WERE FEMALE; AND 60% HAD AT LEAST SOME COLLEGE EDUCATION. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN DEMOGRAPHICS OR OUTCOME MEASURES BETWEEN GROUPS AT BASELINE OR 8 WEEKS; HOWEVER, THE STUDY WAS NOT POWERED TO SEE SUCH DIFFERENCES. INDIVIDUALS RANDOMIZED TO THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE IN ANY OUTCOME MEASURE OVER THE 8 WEEKS. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN COPM PERFORMANCE AND COPM SATISFACTION SCORES FOR INDIVIDUALS RANDOMIZED TO THE YOGA GROUP; BOTH SCORES SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED. COPM PERFORMANCE IMPROVED BY 27% WITH A MODERATE TO LARGE EFFECT SIZE (3.66+/-1.85 VS 4.66+/-1.93, P < 0.001, D = 0.76). COPM SATISFACTION SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED BY 78% (2.14+/-2.31 VS. 3.80+/-2.50, P < 0.001) AND HAD A LARGE EFFECTS SIZE (D = 1.02). FAI SCORES IMPROVED, INDICATING INCREASED ACTIVITY OR ENGAGEMENT IN DAILY OCCUPATION DURING THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION. SCORES INCREASED BY 5% (38.13+/-8.48 VS. 39.90+/-8.57, P = 0.024) WITH A SMALL EFFECT SIZE (D = 0.37). DEPRESSION SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED FROM 13.21+/-5.60 TO 11.41+/-5.82, P = 0.041, WITH A SMALL EFFECT SIZE. CONCLUSION: DATA FROM THIS PILOT RCT INDICATE YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION WITH PEOPLE IN CHRONIC PAIN TO IMPROVE OCCUPATIONAL PERFORMANCE, INCREASE ENGAGEMENT IN ACTIVITIES, AND DECREASE DEPRESSION. OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY PRACTITIONERS MAY CONSIDER ADDING YOGA AS A TREATMENT INTERVENTION TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH PAIN.	2019	

4   63  42 A COMPREHENSIVE YOGA PROGRAMS IMPROVES PAIN, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION IN CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN PATIENTS MORE THAN EXERCISE: AN RCT. INTRODUCTION: PREVIOUSLY, OUTPATIENT YOGA PROGRAMS FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) LASTING SEVERAL MONTHS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO REDUCE PAIN, ANALGESIC REQUIREMENT AND DISABILITY, AND IMPROVE SPINAL MOBILITY. THIS STUDY EVALUATED CHANGES IN PAIN, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND SPINAL MOBILITY FOR CLBP PATIENTS ON SHORT-TERM, RESIDENTIAL YOGA AND PHYSICAL EXERCISE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING COMPREHENSIVE YOGA LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS. METHODS: A SEVEN DAY RANDOMIZED CONTROL SINGLE BLIND ACTIVE STUDY IN AN RESIDENTIAL HOLISTIC HEALTH CENTRE IN BANGALORE, INDIA, ASSIGNED 80 PATIENTS (37 FEMALE, 43 MALE) WITH CLBP TO YOGA AND PHYSICAL EXERCISE GROUPS. THE YOGA PROGRAM CONSISTED OF SPECIFIC ASANAS AND PRANAYAMAS FOR BACK PAIN, MEDITATION, YOGIC COUNSELLING, AND LECTURES ON YOGA PHILOSOPHY. THE CONTROL GROUP PROGRAM INCLUDED PHYSICAL THERAPY EXERCISES FOR BACK PAIN, AND MATCHING COUNSELLING AND EDUCATION SESSIONS. RESULTS: GROUPXTIME INTERACTIONS (P<0.05) AND BETWEEN GROUP DIFFERENCES (P<0.05) WERE SIGNIFICANT IN ALL VARIABLES. BOTH GROUPS' SCORES ON THE NUMERICAL RATING SCALE FOR PAIN REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY, 49% IN YOGA (P<0.001, ES=1.62), 17.5% IN CONTROLS (P=0.005, ES=0.67). STATE ANXIETY (STAI) REDUCED 20.4% (P<0.001, ES=0.72) AND TRAIT ANXIETY 16% (P<0.001, ES=1.09) IN THE YOGA GROUP. DEPRESSION (BDI) DECREASED IN BOTH GROUPS, 47% IN YOGA (P<0.001, ES=0.96,) AND 19.9% IN CONTROLS (P<0.001, ES=0.59). SPINAL MOBILITY ('SIT AND REACH' INSTRUMENT) IMPROVED IN BOTH GROUPS, 50%, IN YOGA (P<0.001, ES=2.99) AND 34.6% IN CONTROLS (P<0.001, ES=0.81). CONCLUSION: SEVEN DAYS INTENSIVE RESIDENTIAL YOGA PROGRAM REDUCES PAIN, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION, AND IMPROVES SPINAL MOBILITY IN PATIENTS WITH CLBP MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN PHYSIOTHERAPY EXERCISES.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
5 1034  54 EFFECTS OF YOGA IN DAILY LIFE PROGRAM IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: TO EXPLORE THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF A YOGA PROGRAM IN IMPROVING HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HQOL), PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONING IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA) PATIENTS. DESIGN: SINGLE-CENTRE PARALLEL-ARMS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING YOGA (N = 30) AND EDUCATION CONTROL GROUP (N = 27). SETTING: TERTIARY CARE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL. INTERVENTION: A 12-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM, BASED ON THE YOGA IN DAILY LIFE SYSTEM, INCLUDED 2X WEEKLY/90-MINUTE SESSIONS. THE CONTROL GROUP HAD 1XWEEKLY/60-MINUTE EDUCATIONAL LECTURES ON ARTHRITIS-RELATED TOPICS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ASSESSMENTS WERE PERFORMED AT BASELINE, 12 (POST-INTERVENTION) AND 24 WEEKS (FOLLOW-UP). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS CHANGE IN THE SHORT FORM-36 (SF-36) HQOL AT 12 WEEKS. LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS WAS ADJUSTED FOR BASELINE SCORES. RESULTS: NO SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND FOR SF-36 (ALL P > 0.05). AT 12 WEEKS THE ADJUSTED MEAN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS FAVOURED YOGA FOR FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CHRONIC ILLNESS THERAPY-FATIGUE (5.08 CI 1.29 TO 8.86; P = 0.009) AND HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE (HADS)-DEPRESSION (-1.37 CI -2.38 TO -0.36); P = 0.008) AND AT 24 WEEKS FOR HADS-ANXIETY (-1.79 CI -3.34 TO - 0.23; P = 0.025), WHILE THE IMPACT ON FATIGUE WAS SUSTAINED (5.43 CI 1.33 TO 9.54, P = 0.01). THE PROGRAM HAD NO IMPACT ON RA DISEASE ACTIVITY. FEASIBILITY OUTCOMES INCLUDED RECRUITMENT RATE 16 %, RETENTION 80.7 %, AND ADHERENCE TO YOGA 87.5 VS 82.7 % FOR CONTROL. NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS WERE RECORDED. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA IN DAILY LIFE PROGRAM WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGE IN HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE OF RA PATIENTS. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN FATIGUE AND MOOD WERE OBSERVED AT POSTINTERVENTION AND FOLLOW-UP. THIS YOGA PROGRAM WAS FOUND FEASIBLE AND SAFE FOR PATIENTS AND MAY COMPLEMENT STANDARD RA TREAT-TO-TARGET STRATEGY.	2021

7  594  45 DEVELOPMENT AND FEASIBILITY OF A GROUP-BASED THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM FOR WOMEN WITH CHRONIC PELVIC PAIN. OBJECTIVE: TO DEVELOP A GROUP-BASED THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM FOR WOMEN WITH CHRONIC PELVIC PAIN (CPP) AND EXPLORE THE EFFECTS OF THIS PROGRAM ON PAIN SEVERITY, SEXUAL FUNCTION, AND WELL-BEING. METHODS: A YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM FOR CPP WAS DEVELOPED BY A MULTIDISCIPLINARY PANEL OF CLINICIANS, RESEARCHERS, AND YOGA CONSULTANTS. WOMEN REPORTING MODERATE TO SEVERE PELVIC PAIN FOR AT LEAST SIX MONTHS WERE RECRUITED INTO A SINGLE-ARM TRIAL. PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED TWICE WEEKLY GROUP CLASSES FOCUSING ON IYENGAR-BASED YOGA TECHNIQUES AND WERE INSTRUCTED TO PRACTICE YOGA AT HOME AN HOUR A WEEK FOR SIX WEEKS. PARTICIPANTS SELF-RATED THE SEVERITY OF THEIR PELVIC PAIN USING DAILY LOGS. THE IMPACT OF PARTICIPANTS' PAIN ON EVERYDAY ACTIVITIES, EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING, AND SEXUAL FUNCTION WAS ASSESSED USING AN IMPACT OF PELVIC PAIN (IPP) QUESTIONNAIRE. SEXUAL FUNCTION WAS FURTHER ASSESSED USING THE SEXUAL HEALTH OUTCOMES IN WOMEN QUESTIONNAIRE (SHOW-Q). RESULTS: AMONG THE 16 PARTICIPANTS (AGE RANGE = 31-64 YEARS), AVERAGE RATINGS OF THE SEVERITY OF PAIN "AT ITS WORST," "AT ITS BEST," AND "ON AVERAGE" DECREASED BY 29%, 32%, AND 34%, RESPECTIVELY, FROM START TO SIX WEEKS (P < 0.05 FOR ALL). WOMEN DEMONSTRATED IMPROVEMENTS IN SCORES ON IPP SUBSCALES FOR DAILY ACTIVITIES (1.8 +/- 0.7 TO 0.9 +/- 0.7, P < 0.001), EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING (1.7 +/- 0.9 TO 0.9 +/- 0.7, P = 0.005), AND SEXUAL FUNCTION (1.9 +/- 1.1 TO 1.0 +/- 0.9, P = 0.04). SCORES ON THE SHOW-Q "PELVIC PROBLEM INTERFERENCE" SCALE ALSO IMPROVED OVER SIX WEEKS (53 +/- 23 TO 27 +/- 23, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS PROVIDE PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE OF THE FEASIBILITY OF TEACHING WOMEN WITH CPP TO PRACTICE YOGA TO SELF-MANAGE PAIN AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE AND SEXUAL FUNCTION.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
8  672  45 EFFECT OF A HOME-BASED SIMPLE YOGA PROGRAM IN CHILD-CARE WORKERS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECT OF A BRIEF, SIMPLE, HOME-BASED YOGA PROGRAM ON BODY PAIN AND HEALTH STATUS IN CHILD-CARE WORKERS. DESIGN: THIS WAS A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING A HOME-BASED YOGA GROUP AND A CONTROL GROUP. PARTICIPANTS: THE TRIAL COMPRISED 98 HEALTHY FEMALE NURSERY SCHOOL AND KINDERGARTEN TEACHERS. INTERVENTIONS: A DVD OF A SIMPLE HOME-BASED YOGA PROGRAM WAS PROVIDED FOR A PERIOD OF 2 WEEKS. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS THE REPORTED CHANGE IN BODY PAIN AT 2 WEEKS (AFTER INTERVENTION) AND 4 WEEKS (FOLLOW-UP). THE SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS THE 30-ITEM GENERAL HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE (GHQ30) SCORE AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION. RESULTS: THE 67 YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS REPORTED IMPROVED MENSTRUAL PAIN AT 4 WEEKS; MENSTRUAL PAIN WAS REDUCED FROM 57.0 +/- 27.8 TO 37.8 +/- 26.7 IN THE YOGA GROUP, VERSUS 52.4 +/- 36.5 TO 46.9 +/- 32.1 IN THE CONTROL GROUP (CHANGE FROM BASELINE IN THE YOGA GROUP VERSUS CHANGE FROM BASELINE IN THE CONTROL GROUP, -15.3 POINTS; P=0.044). THE TOTAL GHQ30 SCORE AND THE GHQ SUBSCALE SCORES ("SLEEP DISTURBANCE" AND "ANXIETY AND DYSPHORIA") IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY AT 4 WEEKS IN THE YOGA GROUP, BUT NOT IN THE CONTROL GROUP. IN THE GOOD-ADHERENCE GROUP, LOW BACK PAIN IMPROVED DURING THE INTERVENTION (P=0.006) AND FOLLOW-UP (P=0.001) PERIODS. MENSTRUAL PAIN WAS ALSO IMPROVED (P=0.044). NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE OBSERVED. CONCLUSIONS: A HOME-BASED SIMPLE YOGA PROGRAM MAY IMPROVE THE HEALTH STATUS OF CHILD-CARE WORKERS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
9 2833  43 YOGA'S EFFECT ON FALLS IN RURAL, OLDER ADULTS. BACKGROUND: UNINTENTIONAL FALLS AFFECT 30% OF PEOPLE OVER AGE 65 YEARS. YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE BALANCE. WE DESIGNED THIS STUDY TO EXAMINE IF YOGA REDUCES FALLS. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED 16 SESSIONS OF HATHA YOGA OVER 8 WEEKS. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO PRACTICE 10MIN OF YOGA DAILY AT HOME IN ADDITION TO 5-MIN RELAXATION EXERCISES OR RELAXATION EXERCISES ONLY (CONTROL GROUP). RESULTS: OF THE 38 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETING THE INTERVENTION, 15 PARTICIPANTS REPORTED A TOTAL OF 27 FALLS IN THE 6-MONTHS BEFORE THE STUDY, COMPARED TO 13 PARTICIPANTS SUSTAINING 14 FALLS IN THE 6 MONTHS FROM THE START OF THE STUDY (P<0.047), WITHOUT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOGA HOME-EXERCISE AND HOME RELAXATION-ONLY GROUPS. COMPARED TO BASELINE SCORES, ALL PARTICIPANTS IMPROVED ON THE BERG BALANCE SCALE (53-54 OUT OF 56, P=0.002), THE FUNCTIONAL GAIT ASSESSMENT (22.9-25.8 OUT OF 30 POINTS, P<0.001), AND THE DYNAMIC GAIT INDEX (20.6-22.4 OUT OF 24 POINTS, P<0.001). RIGHT LEG STAND TIME IMPROVED FROM A MEAN OF 13.3S TO 17.1S (P=0.020) AND STANDING FORWARD REACH DISTANCE FROM 26.0CM TO 29.6CM (P<0.001). WITHOUT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS. CONFIDENCE, WITH THE ACTIVITIES-SPECIFIC BALANCE CONFIDENCE SCALE, INCREASED IN THE YOGA HOME-EXERCISE GROUP (88%-93%, P=0.037) COMPARED TO 90% UNCHANGED FROM PRE-INTERVENTION IN THE HOME RELAXATION-ONLY GROUP. CONCLUSION: YOGA CLASSES REDUCE SELF-REPORTED FALLS AND IMPROVE BALANCE MEASURES. THE ADDITION OF HOME YOGA EXERCISES DID NOT ENHANCE BENEFIT OVER RELAXATION EXERCISE ONLY.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
10 2073  45 THE EFFECT OF A STRETCH AND STRENGTH-BASED YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM ON PATIENTS WITH NEUROPATHIC PAIN DUE TO LUMBAR DISC HERNIATION. STUDY DESIGN: RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF A STRETCH AND STRENGTHBASED YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM ON NEUROPATHIC PAIN DUE TO LDH. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: LDH WITH NEUROPATHIC PAIN INFLUENCES TREATMENT OUTCOMES NEGATIVELY. MOST YOGA POSES INCLUDE THE PARAMETERS OF SPINAL TRAINING AND HELP REDUCE PAIN AND DISABILITY IN PATIENTS WITH LOW BACK INJURIES. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT YOGA POSITIVELY AFFECTS BOTH LDH AND NEUROPATHIC PAIN BY INCREASING MOBILIZATION, CORE MUSCLE STRENGTH, AND SPINAL AND HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY. METHODS: IN TOTAL, 48 PATIENTS WITH NEUROPATHIC PAIN DUE TO LDH WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A CONTROL GROUP AND A YOGA GROUP. ALL PATIENTS UNDERWENT A PATIENT EDUCATION PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, THE SELECTED YOGA EXERCISE WAS TAUGHT AND PERFORMED TO THE YOGA GROUP FOR ONE HOUR TWICE WEEKLY FOR 12 WEEKS. NEUROPATHIC PAIN (DOULEUR NEUROPATHIQUE 4 FOR DIAGNOSIS; LEEDS ASSESSMENT OF NEUROPATHIC SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS FOR SEVERITY), LOW BACK PAIN (THE SHORT-FORM OF MCGILL PAIN QUESTIONNAIRE), DISABILITY (OSWESTRY DISABILITY INDEX), AND FUNCTION (MODIFIED SCHOBER AND PASSIVE KNEE EXTENSION TEST) WERE MEASURED BLIND BEFORE AND AT THE ONE-, THREE-, AND SIX-MONTH FOLLOW-UPS. THE PATIENT GLOBAL ASSESSMENT WAS APPLIED AT THE SIX-MONTH FOLLOWUP. THE INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED IN THIS STUDY. RESULTS: THE INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN NEUROPATHIC PAIN, PATIENT GLOBAL ASSESS MENT, LOW BACK PAIN, DISABILITY, AND FUNCTION IN FAVOR OF THE YOGA GROUP AT POST-TREATMENT. THE BETWEEN-GROUP EFFECT SIZES WERE MODERATE AT SIX-MONTHS FOLLOW-UP. CONCLUSION: IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE SELECTED STRETCH AND STRENGTH-BASED YOGA EXERCISE COULD BE A PROMISING TREATMENT OPTION FOR NEUROPATHIC PAIN DUE TO LDH.

11  290  50 ADJUNCTIVE YOGA V. HEALTH EDUCATION FOR PERSISTENT MAJOR DEPRESSION: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER HATHA YOGA IS AN EFFICACIOUS ADJUNCTIVE INTERVENTION FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH CONTINUED DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS DESPITE ANTIDEPRESSANT TREATMENT. METHOD: WE CONDUCTED A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES (N = 63) V. HEALTH EDUCATION CLASSES (HEALTHY LIVING WORKSHOP; HLW; N = 59) IN INDIVIDUALS WITH ELEVATED DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATION USE. HLW SERVED AS AN ATTENTION-CONTROL GROUP. THE INTERVENTION PERIOD WAS 10 WEEKS, WITH FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENTS 3 AND 6 MONTHS AFTERWARDS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS DEPRESSION SYMPTOM SEVERITY ASSESSED BY BLIND RATER AT 10 WEEKS. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS OVER THE ENTIRE INTERVENTION AND FOLLOW-UP PERIODS, SOCIAL AND ROLE FUNCTIONING, GENERAL HEALTH PERCEPTIONS, PAIN, AND PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING. RESULTS: AT 10 WEEKS, WE DID NOT FIND A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS IN DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS (B = -0.82, S.E. = 0.88, P = 0.36). HOWEVER, OVER THE ENTIRE INTERVENTION AND FOLLOW-UP PERIOD, WHEN CONTROLLING FOR BASELINE, YOGA PARTICIPANTS SHOWED LOWER LEVELS OF DEPRESSION THAN HLW PARTICIPANTS (B = -1.38, S.E. = 0.57, P = 0.02). AT 6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP, 51% OF YOGA PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED A RESPONSE (50% REDUCTION IN DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS) COMPARED WITH 31% OF HLW PARTICIPANTS (ODDS RATIO = 2.31; P = 0.04). YOGA PARTICIPANTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER SOCIAL AND ROLE FUNCTIONING AND GENERAL HEALTH PERCEPTIONS OVER TIME. CONCLUSIONS: ALTHOUGH WE DID NOT SEE A DIFFERENCE IN DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AT THE END OF THE INTERVENTION PERIOD, YOGA PARTICIPANTS SHOWED FEWER DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS OVER THE ENTIRE FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. BENEFITS OF YOGA MAY ACCUMULATE OVER TIME.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
12 2789  47 YOGA THERAPY FOR ABDOMINAL PAIN-RELATED FUNCTIONAL GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS IN CHILDREN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO COMPARE EFFECTS OF 10 WEEKS OF YOGA THERAPY (YT) AND STANDARD MEDICAL CARE (SMC) ON ABDOMINAL PAIN AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) IN CHILDREN WITH ABDOMINAL PAIN-RELATED FUNCTIONAL GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS (AP-FGIDS). METHODS: SIXTY-NINE PATIENTS, AGES 8 TO 18 YEARS, WITH AP-FGIDS, WERE RANDOMIZED TO SMC COMPLEMENTED WITH YT OR SMC ALONE. YT IS A MIXTURE OF YOGA POSES, MEDITATION, AND RELAXATION EXERCISES AND WAS GIVEN ONCE A WEEK IN GROUP SESSIONS. SMC CONSISTED OF EDUCATION, REASSURANCE, DIETARY ADVICE, AND FIBERS/MEBEVERINE, IF NECESSARY. PAIN INTENSITY (PAIN INTENSITY SCORE [PIS] 0-5) AND FREQUENCY (PAIN FREQUENCY SCORE [PFS] 0-4) WERE SCORED IN A PAIN DIARY, AND QOL WAS MEASURED WITH KIDSCREEN-27. FOLLOW-UP WAS 12 MONTHS. TREATMENT RESPONSE WAS DEFINED AS >/=50% REDUCTION OF WEEKLY PAIN SCORES. RESULTS: AT 1-YEAR FOLLOW-UP, TREATMENT RESPONSE WAS ACCOMPLISHED IN 58% OF THE YT GROUP AND IN 29% OF THE CONTROL GROUP (P = 0.01); NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES FOR OTHER TIME POINTS WERE FOUND. YT, AND NOT SMC, RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF PIS (P < 0.01) AND PFS (P < 0.01) AFTER 12 MONTHS. DURING THE STUDY, HOWEVER, YT WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY SUPERIOR COMPARED WITH SMC. SUBANALYSES FOR TIME POINTS DEMONSTRATED A SIGNIFICANT GREATER REDUCTION OF PIS AT 12 MONTHS IN FAVOR OF YT. NO DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND FOR QOL. YT WAS MORE EFFECTIVE IN THE REDUCTION OF REPORTED MONTHLY SCHOOL ABSENCE (P = 0.03). CONCLUSION: AT 1-YEAR FOLLOW-UP, YT IN ADDITION TO STANDARD CARE WAS SUPERIOR COMPARED WITH SMC ACCORDING TO TREATMENT SUCCESS, PIS, AND REDUCTION OF SCHOOL ABSENCE. YT, HOWEVER, WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING PFS OR QOL, COMPARED WITH SMC.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
13 1841  46 QIGONG OR YOGA VERSUS NO INTERVENTION IN OLDER ADULTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN-A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. UNLABELLED: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE REDUCTION OF CHRONIC LOWER BACK PAIN IN OLDER ADULTS USING EITHER YOGA CLASSES OR QIGONG CLASSES COMPARED WITH NO INTERVENTION. OLDER ADULTS (65 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER) WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN WERE ENROLLED IN AND RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO: 1) YOGA (24 CLASSES, 45 MINUTES EACH, DURING 3 MONTHS), 2) QIGONG (12 CLASSES, 90 MINUTES EACH, DURING 3 MONTHS), OR 3) A CONTROL GROUP WHO RECEIVED NO ADDITIONAL INTERVENTION. THE PAIN INTENSITY ITEM OF THE FUNCTIONAL RATING INDEX AFTER 3 MONTHS WAS USED AS PRIMARY OUTCOME PARAMETER. A TOTAL OF 176 PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED (N = 61 YOGA, N = 58 QIGONG, N = 57 CONTROL; MEAN AGE 73 +/- 5.6 YEARS, 89% FEMALE). THE MEAN ADJUSTED PAIN INTENSITY AFTER 3 MONTHS WAS 1.71 FOR THE YOGA GROUP (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI], 1.54-1.89), 1.67 FOR THE QIGONG GROUP (95% CI, 1.45-1.89), AND 1.89 FOR NO INTERVENTION (95% CI, 1.67-2.11). NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT GROUP DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED. POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS FOR THIS LACK OF PAIN RELIEF MIGHT INCLUDE THE INEFFECTIVENESS OF INTERVENTIONS, INAPPROPRIATE OUTCOMES, OR DIFFERENCES IN PAIN PERCEPTION AND PROCESSING IN OLDER ADULTS. PERSPECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE REDUCTION OF CHRONIC LOWER BACK PAIN IN OLDER ADULTS USING EITHER YOGA CLASSES OR QIGONG CLASSES COMPARED WITH NO INTERVENTION. THIS 3-ARMED RANDOMIZED TRIAL WITH 176 OLDER ADULTS SHOWED THAT YOGA AND QIGONG WERE NOT SUPERIOR TO NO TREATMENT IN REDUCING PAIN AND INCREASING QUALITY OF LIFE.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
14 1081  37 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SEXUAL FUNCTION IN WOMEN WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: FEMALE SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION IS AN IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE; IT HAS A HIGH GLOBAL PREVALENCE, BUT NO EFFECTIVE AND SAFE TREATMENT OPTIONS. THE PREVALENCE OF SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION IS HIGHER IN WOMEN WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME THAN IN THE GENERAL POPULATION. AIM: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA AS A TREATMENT FOR SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION IN WOMEN WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME. METHODS: IN THIS RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED STUDY, 41 WOMEN WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME (AGE 30-60 YEARS) WERE ASSIGNED TO A 12-WEEK YOGA EXERCISE GROUP (N=20) OR A WAIT-LISTED CONTROL GROUP (N=21). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PRIMARY END POINTS WERE CHANGES IN TOTAL AND INDIVIDUAL DOMAIN SCORES ON THE FEMALE SEXUAL FUNCTION INDEX. RESULTS: THE 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN AROUSAL (0.74+/-1.18 VS. 0.16+/-0.82, RESPECTIVELY; P=0.042) AND LUBRICATION (0.72+/-1.12 VS. 0.06+/-0.87, RESPECTIVELY; P=0.008) COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN THE YOGA GROUP THAN IN THE CONTROL GROUP AT THE 12-WEEK FOLLOW UP (-3.5+/-13.7 VS. 2.0+/-14.7, RESPECTIVELY; P=0.040). CONCLUSION: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION IN WOMEN WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME AS WELL AS FOR METABOLIC RISK FACTORS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
15  920  50 EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AND EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION ON DISABILITY, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND PAIN IN PEOPLE WITH CLBP: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: THE CURRENT STUDY INVESTIGATES THE EFFECTS OF AN 8-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM WITH EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION COMPARED WITH AN INFORMATIONAL PAMPHLET ON DISABILITY, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND PAIN, IN PEOPLE AFFECTED BY CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP). METHODS: THIRTY INDIVIDUALS (AGE 34.2+/-4.52YRS) WITH CLBP WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED INTO A YOGA GROUP (YG, N=15) AND A PAMPHLET GROUP (PG, N=15). THE YG PARTICIPATED IN AN 8-WEEK (2 DAYS PER WEEK) YOGA PROGRAM WHICH INCLUDED EDUCATION ON SPINE ANATOMY/BIOMECHANICS AND THE MANAGEMENT OF CLBP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: MONITORING RESPONSE TO INTERVENTION, THE OSWESTRY LOW BACK PAIN DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE (ODI-I), ZUNG SELF-RATING DEPRESSION SCALE (SDS), ZUNG SELF-RATING ANXIETY SCALE (SAS) AND NUMERIC RATING SCALE FOR PAIN (NRS 0-10) WERE USED TO COLLECT DATA. RESULTS: AFTER INTERVENTION, THE YG SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE (P<0.05) IN THE MEAN SCORE IN ALL ASSESSED VARIABLES WHEN COMPARED WITH BASELINE DATA. IN ADDITION, STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P<0.05) DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED AMONG GROUPS AT THE END OF INTERVENTION IN DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND PAIN, BUT NOT IN DISABILITY. CONCLUSIONS: THE YOGA PROGRAM AND EDUCATION TOGETHER APPEAR TO BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, WHICH CAN AFFECT PERCEPTION OF PAIN.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
16 1818  44 PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF STANDARD ANTIEMETIC THERAPY WITH YOGA VERSUS STANDARD ANTIEMETIC THERAPY ALONE FOR HIGHLY EMETOGENIC CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA AND VOMITING IN SOUTH ASIAN POPULATION. AIM/BACKGROUND: CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA AND VOMITING (CINV) IS ONE OF THE MOST DISTRESSING SIDE EFFECTS OF HIGHLY EMETOGENIC CHEMOTHERAPY REGIMENS. THERE HAVE BEEN CONTINUOUS EFFORTS IN THE DIRECTION TO CONTROL CINV BY MANY INVESTIGATORS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: RANDOMLY SELECTED PATIENTS WERE THOSE RECEIVING HIGHLY EMETOGENIC CHEMOTHERAPY REGIMEN GROUPED INTO YOGA AND STANDARD ANTIEMETIC THERAPY (N = 50) JUST BEFORE RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY AND CONTINUED FOR THE FOLLOWING DAYS AND OTHER GROUP (N = 50) RECEIVED ONLY THE STANDARD ANTIEMETIC AGENT. BOTH THE GROUPS WERE ASSESSED, FOLLOWED FOR ACUTE AND DELAYED ONSET OF CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED AND ANTICIPATORY NAUSEA AND VOMITING USING RADIATION THERAPY ONCOLOGY GROUP GRADING FOR THE SAME. WE ALSO ASSESSED THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF THE PATIENT USING THE FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CANCER THERAPY-GENERAL QUESTIONNAIRE. RESULTS: THE MEDIAN AGE GROUP OF THE PATIENTS WAS 51 YEARS WITH MALE:FEMALE RATIO 2:1, THE EASTERN COOPERATIVE ONCOLOGY GROUP (ECOG) PERFORMANCE STATUS WAS 0/1 IN 38% OF THE SELECTED POPULATION, WHILE ECOG 2 IN 62% OF THE PATIENTS. IN YOGA ARM, INSIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA (90% VS. 78%, P = 0.35) AND BUT SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN VOMITING (42% VS. 22%, P =0.01) WAS OBSERVED AS COMPARED TO THE STANDARD ANTIEMETICS ONLY ARM. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN GRADE 2 AND 3 NAUSEA (84% VS. 38% P < 0.01) AND VOMITING (14% VS. 0% P < 0.01). QUALITY OF LIFE IS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED IN THE YOGA ARM, ESPECIALLY IN THE ECOG 2 PERFORMANCE STATUS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY CONCLUDES THAT YOGA ALONG WITH STANDARD ANTIEMETIC MEDICATION SHOULD BE A PART OF THE MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR THE CANCER PATIENTS RECEIVING HIGHLY EMETOGENIC CHEMOTHERAPY.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
17 1246  37 FEASIBILITY OF INTEGRATION OF YOGA IN A BEHAVIORAL WEIGHT-LOSS INTERVENTION: A RANDOMIZED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE FEASIBILITY AND COMPARISON OF TWO STYLES OF YOGA WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A STANDARD BEHAVIORAL WEIGHT-LOSS INTERVENTION (SBWI). METHODS: FIFTY ADULTS WITH OBESITY (BMI: 31.3 +/- 3.8 KG/M(2) ) PARTICIPATED IN THIS 6-MONTH STUDY THAT INCLUDED A SBWI AND A CALORIE- AND FAT-REDUCED DIET. RANDOMIZATION WAS TO RESTORATIVE HATHA (SBWI+RES) OR VINYASA (SBWI+VIN) YOGA. YOGA WAS PRESCRIBED TO INCREASE FROM 20 TO 40 TO 60 MINUTES PER SESSION ACROSS THE INTERVENTION. WEIGHT WAS ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND 6 MONTHS. PERCEPTIONS OF YOGA WERE ASSESSED AT THE COMPLETION OF THE INTERVENTION. RESULTS: ADJUSTED WEIGHT LOSS WAS -3.4 KG (95% CI: -6.4 TO -0.5) IN SBWI+RES AND -3.8 KG (95% CI: -6.8 TO -0.9) IN SBWI+VIN (P < 0.001), WITH NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS. OF ALL PARTICIPANTS, 74.4% REPORTED THAT THEY WOULD CONTINUE PARTICIPATION IN YOGA AFTER THE SBWI. SESSION DURATION WAS A BARRIER AS YOGA INCREASED FROM 20 TO 40 TO 60 MINUTES PER DAY, WITH 0%, 7.5%, AND 48.8% REPORTING THIS BARRIER, RESPECTIVELY. CONCLUSIONS: AMONG ADULTS WITH OBESITY, YOGA PARTICIPATION, WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF A SBWI, APPEARS TO BE FEASIBLE, WITH WEIGHT LOSS NOT DIFFERING BY STYLE OF YOGA. PROGRESSING TO 60 MINUTES PER SESSION APPEARS TO BE A BARRIER TO ENGAGEMENT IN YOGA IN THIS POPULATION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
18  504  43 COMMUNITY-DELIVERED HEATED HATHA YOGA AS A TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS: AN UNCONTROLLED PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVES: THERE ARE NO KNOWN STUDIES OF CONCURRENT EXPOSURE TO HIGH TEMPERATURE AND YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION. THIS STUDY EXPLORED ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF HEATED (BIKRAM) YOGA AS A TREATMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. DESIGN: AN 8-WEEK, OPEN-LABEL PILOT STUDY OF HEATED YOGA FOR DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. SUBJECTS: 28 MEDICALLY HEALTHY ADULTS (71.4% FEMALE, MEAN AGE 36 [STANDARD DEVIATION 13.57]) WITH AT LEAST MILD DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (HAMILTON RATING SCALE FOR DEPRESSION [HRSD-17] SCORE >/=10) WHO ATTENDED AT LEAST ONE YOGA CLASS AND SUBSEQUENT ASSESSMENT VISIT. INTERVENTION: PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO ATTEND AT LEAST TWICE WEEKLY COMMUNITY HELD BIKRAM YOGA CLASSES. ASSESSMENTS WERE PERFORMED AT SCREENING AND WEEKS 1, 3, 5, AND 8. HYPOTHESES WERE TESTED USING A MODIFIED-INTENT-TO-TREAT APPROACH, INCLUDING PARTICIPANTS WHO ATTENDED AT LEAST ONE YOGA CLASS AND SUBSEQUENT ASSESSMENT VISIT (N = 28). RESULTS: ALMOST HALF OF OUR SUBJECTS COMPLETED THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION, AND CLOSE TO A THIRD ATTENDED THREE QUARTERS OR MORE OF THE PRESCRIBED 16 CLASSES OVER 8 WEEKS. MULTILEVEL MODELING REVEALED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS OVER TIME IN BOTH CLINICIAN-RATED HRSD-17 (P = 0.003; DGLMM = 1.43) AND SELF-REPORTED BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY (BDI; P < 0.001, DGLMM = 1.31) DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, AS WELL AS THE FOUR SECONDARY OUTCOMES: HOPELESSNESS (P = 0.024, DGLMM = 0.57), ANXIETY (P < 0.001, DGLMM = 0.78), COGNITIVE/PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING (P < 0.001, DGLMM = 1.34), AND QUALITY OF LIFE (P = 0.007, DGLMM = 1.29). OF 23 PARTICIPANTS WITH DATA THROUGH WEEK 3 OR LATER, 12 (52.2%) WERE TREATMENT RESPONDERS (>/=50% REDUCTION IN HRSD-17 SCORE), AND 13 (56.5%) ATTAINED REMISSION (HRSD SCORE </=7). MORE FREQUENT ATTENDANCE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENT IN SELF-RATED DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS, HOPELESSNESS, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. CONCLUSIONS: THE ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF HEATED YOGA IN THIS PARTICULAR SAMPLE WITH THIS PROTOCOL WARRANTS FURTHER ATTENTION. THE HEATED YOGA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, AND OTHER IMPROVED RELATED MENTAL HEALTH SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING ANXIETY, HOPELESSNESS, AND QUALITY OF LIFE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
19 2260  49 THE PRACTICE OF HATHA YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF PAIN ASSOCIATED WITH ENDOMETRIOSIS. OBJECTIVES: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE CHRONIC PELVIC PAIN, MENSTRUAL PATTERNS, AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) IN TWO GROUPS OF WOMEN WITH ENDOMETRIOSIS: THOSE WHO DID AND THOSE WHO DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN A SPECIFIC 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. METHOD: THIS WAS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. IT WAS CONDUCTED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMPINAS MEDICAL SCHOOL, CAMPINAS, SP, BRAZIL. FORTY WOMEN WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: AN INTERVENTION GROUP OF WOMEN WHO PRACTICED YOGA (N = 28), AND A CONTROL GROUP OF WOMEN WHO DID NOT PRACTICE YOGA (N = 12). PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED 90-MIN SCHEDULED YOGA SESSIONS TWICE A WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS. ADDITIONALLY, AN ENDOMETRIOSIS HEALTH PROFILE (EHP)-30 QUESTIONNAIRE WAS APPLIED TO EVALUATE WOMEN'S QOL AT ADMISSION AND 2 MONTHS LATER UPON COMPLETION OF THE YOGA PROGRAM. MENSTRUAL AND DAILY PAIN PATTERNS WERE EVALUATED THROUGH A DAILY CALENDAR (VISUAL ANALOG SCALE). RESULTS: THE DEGREE OF DAILY PAIN WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AMONG THE WOMEN WHO PRACTICED YOGA COMPARED WITH THE NON-YOGA GROUP (P = 0.0007). THERE WAS AN IMPROVEMENT OF QOL IN BOTH GROUPS BETWEEN BASELINE AND THE END OF THE STUDY EVALUATION. IN RELATION TO EHP-30 DOMAINS, PAIN (P = 0.0046), IMPOTENCE (P = 0.0006), WELL-BEING (P = 0.0009), AND IMAGE (P = 0.0087) FROM THE CENTRAL QUESTIONNAIRE, AND WORK (P = 0.0027) AND TREATMENT (P = 0.0245) FROM THE MODULAR QUESTIONNAIRE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE STUDY GROUPS OVER TIME. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS REGARDING THE DIARY OF MENSTRUAL PATTERNS (P = 0.96). CONCLUSIONS: YOGA PRACTICE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A REDUCTION IN LEVELS OF CHRONIC PELVIC PAIN AND AN IMPROVEMENT IN QOL IN WOMEN WITH ENDOMETRIOSIS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
20 2561  53 YOGA FOR CHRONIC NECK PAIN: A 12-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF A 9-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION ON CHRONIC NONSPECIFIC NECK PAIN 12 MONTHS AFTER COMPLETION. DESIGN: TWELVE-MONTH FOLLOW-UP OF THE POOLED DATA OF BOTH ARMS OF A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: DEPARTMENT OF INTERNAL AND INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE AT AN ACADEMIC TEACHING HOSPITAL. SUBJECTS: FIFTY-ONE PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC NONSPECIFIC NECK PAIN (MEAN AGE 47.8 YEARS; 82.4% FEMALE). INTERVENTIONS: A 9-WEEK YOGA GROUP INTERVENTION. OUTCOME MEASURES: NECK PAIN INTENSITY (100-MM VISUAL ANALOG SCALE), FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY (NECK DISABILITY INDEX), HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (SHORT-FORM 36 QUESTIONNAIRE, SF-36), GENERIC DISABILITY (DAYS WITH RESTRICTED ACTIVITIES), AND GLOBAL IMPROVEMENT. RESULTS: FROM BASELINE TO 12-MONTH FOLLOW-UP, PAIN INTENSITY IMPROVED FROM 48.81 +/- 17.71 TO 32.31 +/- 20.68 (P < 0.001), NECK-RELATED DISABILITY DECREASED FROM 25.26 +/- 9.02 TO 19.49 +/- 11.52 (P = 0.001), AND BODILY PAIN IN THE SF-36 IMPROVED FROM 49.37 +/- 12.40 TO 59.26 +/- 17.57 (P = 0.005). IMPROVEMENTS IN PAIN INTENSITY WERE PREDICTED BY WEEKLY MINUTES OF YOGA PRACTICE DURING THE PAST 4 WEEKS (R(2) = 0.12, P = 0.028); IMPROVED NECK-RELATED DISABILITY (R(2) = 0.24, P = 0.001) AND BODILY PAIN (R(2) = 0.26, P = 0.006) WERE PREDICTED BY REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE DURING THE PAST 12 MONTHS. GENERIC DISABILITY DID NOT DECREASE SIGNIFICANTLY. TWENTY-FOUR PATIENTS (68.6%) RATED THEIR HEALTH AS AT LEAST SOMEWHAT IMPROVED. CONCLUSIONS: A 9-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION IMPROVED PAIN AND NECK-RELATED DISABILITY FOR AT LEAST 12 MONTHS AFTER COMPLETION. SUSTAINED YOGA PRACTICE SEEMS TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT PREDICTOR OF LONG-TERM EFFECTIVENESS.	2013

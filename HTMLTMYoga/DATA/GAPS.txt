1 1189 162 EVIDENCE ON YOGA FOR HEALTH: A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS. OBJECTIVE: TO SUPPORT THE RESEARCH AGENDA IN YOGA FOR HEALTH BY COMPREHENSIVELY IDENTIFYING SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF YOGA FOR HEALTH OUTCOMES AND CONDUCTING A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS TO DESCRIBE THEIR PUBLICATION CHARACTERISTICS AND TOPIC COVERAGE. METHODS: WE SEARCHED 7 DATABASES (MEDLINE/PUBMED, EMBASE, PSYCINFO, CINAHL, AMED, THE COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS, AND PROSPERO) FROM THEIR INCEPTION TO NOVEMBER 2019 AND 1 DATABASE (INDMED) FROM INCEPTION TO JANUARY 2017. TWO AUTHORS INDEPENDENTLY SCREENED EACH RECORD FOR INCLUSION AND ONE AUTHOR EXTRACTED PUBLICATION CHARACTERISTICS AND TOPICS OF INCLUDED REVIEWS. RESULTS: WE RETRIEVED 2710 RECORDS AND INCLUDED 322 SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS. 157 REVIEWS WERE EXCLUSIVELY ON YOGA, AND 165 WERE ON YOGA AS ONE OF A LARGER CLASS OF INTERVENTIONS (E.G., EXERCISE). MOST REVIEWS WERE PUBLISHED IN 2012 OR LATER (260/322; 81 %). FIRST/CORRESPONDING AUTHORS WERE FROM 32 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES; THREE-QUARTERS WERE FROM THE USA, GERMANY, CHINA, AUSTRALIA, THE UK OR CANADA (240/322; 75 %). REVIEWS WERE MOST FREQUENTLY PUBLISHED IN SPECIALITY JOURNALS (161/322; 50 %) COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE JOURNALS (66/322; 20 %) OR SYSTEMATIC REVIEW JOURNALS (59/322; 18 %). ALMOST ALL WERE PRESENT IN MEDLINE (296/322; 92 %). REVIEWS WERE MOST OFTEN FUNDED BY GOVERNMENT OR NON-PROFITS (134/322; 42 %), UNFUNDED (74/322; 23 %), OR NOT EXPLICIT ABOUT FUNDING (111/322; 34 %). COMMON HEALTH TOPICS WERE PSYCHIATRIC/COGNITIVE (N = 56), CANCER (N = 39) AND MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS (N = 36). MULTIPLE REVIEWS COVERED SIMILAR TOPICS, PARTICULARLY DEPRESSION/ANXIETY (N = 18), BREAST CANCER (N = 21), AND LOW BACK PAIN (N = 16). CONCLUSIONS: FURTHER RESEARCH SHOULD EXPLORE THE OVERALL QUALITY OF REPORTING AND CONDUCT OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF YOGA, THE DIRECTION AND CERTAINTY OF SPECIFIC CONCLUSIONS, AND DUPLICATION OR GAPS IN REVIEW COVERAGE OF TOPICS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
2  143  38 A PUBMED-BASED EXPLORATION OF THE COURSE OF YOGA RESEARCH FROM 1948 TO 2020. YOGA RESEARCH CITATIONS FROM 1948 TO 2020 IN PUBMED WERE FILTERED AND SORTED IN 10-YEAR INTERVALS TO EXPLORE THE OCCURRENCE AND TIME FRAME OF CHANGE IN (1) THE FOCUS OF RESEARCH; (2) THE NUMBER OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS), SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS (SRS), AND META-ANALYSES (MAS); (3) HEALTH CONDITIONS RESEARCHED FOR YOGA AS THERAPY; (4) JOURNALS WITH YOGA RESEARCH; AND (5) THE RESEARCH ON YOGA FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. PUBLICATIONS ON YOGA BETWEEN 1948 AND 1970 (1.25%) FOCUSED ON EXCEPTIONAL ABILITIES OF EXPERIENCED YOGA PRACTITIONERS, APPARENTLY RELATED TO THE SPIRITUAL GOAL OF YOGA; FROM 1971 TO 2000 (6.87%), THE FOCUS WAS ON YOGA IN HEALTH AND THERAPY; AND FROM 2001 TO 2020 (91.88%), RESEARCH PUBLICATIONS ON YOGA INCREASED AND CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON HEALTH AND THERAPY, WITH FEWER RCTS RELATIVE TO THE SRS AND MAS ON YOGA IN PUBMED. PUBLICATIONS ON YOGA REPORTED THE FOLLOWING HEALTH CONDITIONS MOST OFTEN: FROM 1981 TO 1990, (1) ASTHMA, (2) STRESS, AND (3) DIABETES; FROM 1991 TO 2000, (1) STRESS FOLLOWED BY (2) ASTHMA, ANXIETY, AND PAIN (ALL THREE WITH EQUAL PERCENTAGES); FROM 2001 TO 2010, (1) DEPRESSION, (2) STRESS, AND (3) ANXIETY; AND FROM 2011 TO 2020, (1) STRESS, (2) DEPRESSION, AND (3) PAIN. THE JOURNALS PUBLISHING RESEARCH ON YOGA IN PUBMED HAVE CHANGED BETWEEN 1971 AND 2020 AS FOLLOWS: HIGHLY CLINICALLY RELEVANT, BROAD-INTEREST MEDICAL JOURNALS (1971 TO 1990); JOURNALS RELEVANT TO MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS (1991 TO 2000); AND SPECIALIZED JOURNALS FOR COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE, PARTICULAR BRANCHES OF MEDICINE, OR RESEARCH STUDY DESIGNS (2001 TO 2020). THE HIGHEST YOGA RESEARCH OUTPUT FROM 1971 TO 1980 CAME FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM (RCTS); FROM 1981 TO 1990 THE MOST RESEARCH CAME FROM THE UNITED STATES (RCTS); FROM 1991 TO 2000 THE MOST RESEARCH CAME FROM INDIA (RCTS) AND THE UNITED KINGDOM (SRS); FROM 2001 TO 2010 THE MOST RESEARCH CAME FROM THE UNITED STATES (RCTS, SRS) AND THE UNITED KINGDOM (MAS); AND FROM 2011 TO 2020 THE MOST RESEARCH CAME FROM THE UNITED STATES (RCTS, SRS, MAS). THE TRENDS IN YOGA RESEARCH FROM THIS ANALYSIS REFLECT INCREASED RESEARCH RELATED TO YOGA AND HEALTH WHILE SUGGESTING AREAS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH BASED ON THE STRENGTHS AND GAPS THAT HAVE EMERGED.	2021	
                                                                 
3  548  36 CONTENT, STRUCTURE, AND DELIVERY CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MANAGING HYPERTENSION: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW PROTOCOL. AIMS: THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AIMS TO SUMMARIZE THE CONTENT, STRUCTURE, AND DELIVERY CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS USED FOR MANAGING HYPERTENSION. INTRODUCTION: GLOBALLY, HYPERTENSION-RELATED MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY ARE HIGH. YOGA MIGHT BE A POTENTIAL SOLUTION FOR MANAGING HYPERTENSION.

4 2832  31 YOGA'S BIOPHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS ON LOWER URINARY TRACT SYMPTOMS: A SCOPING REVIEW. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: YOGA IS A MIND AND BODY PRACTICE THAT INCLUDES RELAXATION, MEDITATION, BREATHING EXERCISES, AND BODY POSTURES. IT CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN ENHANCING THE FUNCTIONING OF SEVERAL BODY SYSTEMS, INCLUDING THE LOWER URINARY TRACT. NORMAL LOWER URINARY TRACT FUNCTIONING DEPENDS IN PART ON THE COORDINATION OF THE BLADDER, URETHRA, PELVIC FLOOR AND OTHER MUSCLES, AND THE NERVES THAT CONTROL THEM. LOWER URINARY TRACT DYSFUNCTION CAN LEAD TO SYMPTOMS, THAT IS, STRESS URINARY INCONTINENCE (UI), URINARY FREQUENCY, NOCTURIA, URINARY URGENCY WITH AND WITHOUT INCONTINENCE, AND MIXED UI. RECENT EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT YOGA CAN IMPROVE LOWER URINARY TRACT SYMPTOMS (LUTS). THUS, WE PERFORMED A SCOPING REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE WITH REGARD TO THE EVIDENCE FOR THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON LUTS AND FACTORS THAT MAY MEDIATE YOGA'S EFFECTS ON LUTS WITH THE GOAL TO IDENTIFY GAPS IN KNOWLEDGE REGARDING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOGA PRACTICE AND LUTS. METHODS: THE AUTHORS EMPLOYED THE PRISMA EXTENSION FOR SCOPING REVIEWS (PRISMA-SCR) METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH, PROPOSED BY TRICCO ET AL., BY SEARCHING THE ELECTRONIC DATABASES, PUBMED, EMBASE, AND PSYCINFO, FOR ARTICLES USING THE FOLLOWING KEYWORDS: YOGA, URINARY INCONTINENCE, URINARY TRACT, BLADDER, AND URETHRA. WE ASSESSED THE QUALITY OF THE STUDIES USING THE JOANNA BRIGGS INSTITUTE CRITICAL APPRAISAL CHECKLIST. RESULTS: OF THE 172 ARTICLES WE FOUND, 8 ARTICLES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA AND WERE REVIEWED. WE FOUND THAT, DESPITE THE USE OF DIFFERENT PROTOCOLS, YOGA MAY REDUCE CERTAIN LUTS BY INCREASING THE STRENGTH OF PELVIC FLOOR MUSCLE AND/OR REGULATING THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM AND ACTIVATING THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA IS A NONINVASIVE PRACTICE THAT MAY IMPROVE SOME LUTS. RIGOROUS STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE SPECIFIC MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH YOGA MAY AFFECT LUTS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
5 1737  38 PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND YOGA-BASED APPROACHES FOR PREGNANCY-RELATED LOW BACK AND PELVIC PAIN. OBJECTIVE: TO CONDUCT AN INTEGRATIVE REVIEW TO EVALUATE CURRENT LITERATURE ABOUT NONPHARMACOLOGIC, EASILY ACCESSIBLE MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES FOR PREGNANCY-RELATED LOW BACK AND PELVIC PAIN (PR-LBPP). DATA SOURCES: PUBMED, CINAHL, COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS. STUDY SELECTION: ORIGINAL RESEARCH ARTICLES WERE CONSIDERED FOR REVIEW IF THEY WERE FULL-LENGTH PUBLICATIONS WRITTEN IN ENGLISH AND PUBLISHED IN PEER-REVIEWED JOURNALS FROM 2005 THROUGH 2015, INCLUDED MEASURES OF PAIN AND SYMPTOMS RELATED TO PR-LBPP, AND EVALUATED TREATMENT MODALITIES THAT USED A PHYSICAL EXERCISE OR YOGA-BASED APPROACH FOR THE DESCRIBED CONDITIONS. DATA EXTRACTION: ELECTRONIC DATABASE SEARCHES YIELDED 1,435 ARTICLES. A TOTAL OF 15 ARTICLES MET ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR FURTHER REVIEW. DATA SYNTHESIS: THESE MODALITIES SHOW PRELIMINARY PROMISE FOR PAIN RELIEF AND OTHER RELATED SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING STRESS AND DEPRESSION. HOWEVER, OUR FINDINGS ALSO INDICATE SEVERAL GAPS IN KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THESE THERAPIES FOR PR-LBPP AND METHODOLOGIC ISSUES WITH THE CURRENT LITERATURE. CONCLUSION: ALTHOUGH ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS REQUIRED, THE RESULTS OF THIS INTEGRATIVE REVIEW SUGGEST THAT CLINICIANS MAY CONSIDER RECOMMENDING NONPHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT OPTIONS, SUCH AS GENTLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS, FOR PR-LBPP AND RELATED SYMPTOMS.	2017

7 2630  18 YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION: FIVE QUESTIONS TO MOVE THE EVIDENCE-BASE FORWARD. YOGA-BASED PRACTICES, DERIVED FROM ANCIENT EASTERN MIND-BODY PRACTICES, HAVE GROWN IN POPULARITY IN THE WEST OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES. INCREASING EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFECTS OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS (YBIS). HOWEVER, DESPITE YOGA'S PROMISE AS A POTENTIAL TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION, THE LITERATURE TO DATE IS MARKED BY SUBSTANTIAL METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS, WHICH REMAIN A BARRIER TO THE INTEGRATION OF YBIS INTO CONVENTIONAL CLINICAL CARE. WE HIGHLIGHT FIVE KEY AREAS OF STUDY THAT NEED FURTHER INVESTIGATION TO FILL CRUCIAL GAPS IN THE LITERATURE-BASE TO ADVANCE YOGA RESEARCH AND YOGA'S POTENTIAL AS AN EFFECTIVE EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION.	2019

10 2066  43 THE CHARACTERISTICS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF PREGNANCY YOGA INTERVENTIONS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS A POPULAR MIND-BODY MEDICINE FREQUENTLY RECOMMENDED TO PREGNANT WOMEN. GAPS REMAIN IN OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE CORE COMPONENTS OF EFFECTIVE PREGNANCY YOGA PROGRAMMES. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS EXAMINED THE CHARACTERISTICS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF PREGNANCY YOGA INTERVENTIONS, INCORPORATING THE FITT (FREQUENCY, INTENSITY, TIME/DURATION AND TYPE) PRINCIPLE OF EXERCISE PRESCRIPTION. METHODS: NINE ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE SEARCHED: MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, WHOLIS, AMED, SCIELO, ASSIA AND WEB OF SCIENCE. RANDOMISED CONTROL TRIALS AND QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES EXAMINING PREGNANCY YOGA INTERVENTIONS WERE ELIGIBLE. COVIDENCE WAS USED TO SCREEN TITLES, ABSTRACTS, AND FULL-TEXT ARTICLES. OUTCOMES OF INTEREST WERE STRESS, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, QUALITY OF LIFE, LABOUR DURATION, PAIN MANAGEMENT IN LABOUR AND MODE OF BIRTH. THE COCHRANE COLLABORATION'S RISK OF BIAS ASSESSMENT TOOL WAS USED TO ASSESS METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF STUDIES AND GRADE CRITERIA (GRADEPRO) EVALUATED QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE. META-ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED USING REVMAN 5.3. RESULTS: OF 862 CITATIONS RETRIEVED, 31 STUDIES MET INCLUSION CRITERIA. TWENTY-NINE STUDIES WITH 2217 PREGNANT WOMEN WERE INCLUDED FOR META-ANALYSIS. PREGNANCY YOGA INTERVENTIONS REDUCED ANXIETY (SMD: -0.91; 95% CI: - 1.49 TO - 0.33; P = 0.002), DEPRESSION (SMD: -0.47; 95% CI: - 0.9 TO - 0.04, P = 0.03) AND PERCEIVED STRESS (SMD: -1.03; 95% CI: - 1.55 TO - 0.52; P < 0.001). YOGA INTERVENTIONS ALSO REDUCED DURATION OF LABOUR (MD = - 117.75; 95% CI - 153.80 TO - 81.71, P < 0.001) AND, INCREASED ODDS OF NORMAL VAGINAL BIRTH (OR 2.58; 95% CI 1.46-4.56, P < 0.001) AND TOLERANCE FOR PAIN. THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE (GRADE CRITERIA) WAS LOW TO VERY LOW FOR ALL OUTCOMES. TWELVE OR MORE YOGA SESSIONS DELIVERED WEEKLY/BI-WEEKLY HAD A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON MODE OF BIRTH, WHILE 12 OR MORE YOGA SESSIONS OF LONG DURATION (> 60 MIN) HAD A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PERCEIVED STRESS. CONCLUSION: THE EVIDENCE HIGHLIGHTS POSITIVE EFFECTS OF PREGNANCY YOGA ON ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, PERCEIVED STRESS, MODE OF BIRTH AND DURATION OF LABOUR.

11 2121  42 THE EFFECTIVENESS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF PREGNANCY YOGA INTERVENTIONS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW PROTOCOL. BACKGROUND: THE PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW IS TO SYSTEMATICALLY EXAMINE THE REPORTED CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF PREGNANCY YOGA. THE REVIEW WILL USE THE FITT (FREQUENCY, INTENSITY, TIME/DURATION AND TYPE) PRINCIPLE OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO CHARACTERISE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN EVALUATED IN THE INCLUDED STUDIES. STUDIES WILL BE CATEGORISED AS EFFECTIVENESS OR EFFICACY STUDIES AND THIS CONTINUUM OF EFFICACY VERSUS EFFECTIVENESS WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE FULL REVIEW. METHODS/DESIGN: THE FOLLOWING ELECTRONIC DATABASES WILL BE SEARCHED USING A DETAILED SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, WHOLIS, AMED, SCIELO, ASSIA AND WEB OF SCIENCE. RANDOMISED CONTROL TRIALS AND QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES EXAMINING PREGNANCY YOGA AND REPORTING ON EFFECT WILL BE INCLUDED. TITLES, ABSTRACTS AND FULL ARTICLES WILL BE SCREENED BY TWO INVESTIGATORS INDEPENDENTLY TO IDENTIFY ELIGIBLE STUDIES. THE COCHRANE COLLABORATION'S RISK OF BIAS ASSESSMENT TOOL WILL BE USED TO ASSESS STUDY QUALITY. QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE WILL BE EVALUATED USING THE GRADE CRITERIA. A STANDARDISED DATA EXTRACTION FORM WILL BE USED TO EXTRACT DATA. EFFECT SIZES WILL BE ESTIMATED USING MEAN DIFFERENCES FOR CONTINUOUS OUTCOMES, AND RELATIVE RISKS FOR DICHOTOMOUS OUTCOME. WHERE POSSIBLE, POOLING OF EFFECT ESTIMATES WILL BE DONE USING A RANDOM EFFECT MODEL. THE OUTCOMES OF INTEREST ARE QUALITY OF LIFE, STRESS, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, MODE OF BIRTH, LABOUR DURATION AND PAIN MANAGEMENT IN LABOUR. DISCUSSION: THIS REVIEW WILL SYNTHESISE THE BEST AVAILABLE EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA DURING PREGNANCY AND PROVIDE VALUABLE HIGH-QUALITY INFORMATION FOR CLINICIANS AND HEALTH POLICYMAKERS. FINDINGS WILL BE DISSEMINATED THROUGH PUBLICATION IN A PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL AND PRESENTATION AT RELEVANT CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS. THE REVIEW WILL MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE APPROPRIATE VOLUME, INTENSITY AND TYPE OF PREGNANCY YOGA FOR MAXIMUM EFFECT AND MAY HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND PRACTICE RELATING TO PREGNANCY YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION.

12 1435  37 IN SEARCH OF YOGA: RESEARCH TRENDS IN A WESTERN MEDICAL DATABASE. CONTEXT: THE PROMOTION OF YOGA PRACTICE AS A PREVENTATIVE AND TREATMENT THERAPY FOR HEALTH OUTCOMES IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE IS INCREASING RAPIDLY. AS THE COMMERCIAL SUCCESS OF YOGA BURGEONS IN POPULAR CULTURE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO INVESTIGATE THE TRENDS OF YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION IN ACADEMIC LITERATURE. THE FREE-ACCESS SEARCH ENGINE, PUBMED IS A PREEMINENT RESOURCE TO IDENTIFY HEALTH-RELATED RESEARCH ARTICLES PUBLISHED FOR ACADEMICS, HEALTH PRACTITIONERS AND OTHERS. AIMS: TO REPORT THE RECENT YOGA-RELATED PUBLICATIONS IN THE WESTERN HEALTHCARE CONTEXT WITH PARTICULAR INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT AND TYPE OF YOGA TITLES. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS TO DESCRIBE THE ANNUAL TRENDS IN PUBLICATION ON PUBMED FROM JANUARY 1950 TO DECEMBER 2012. RESULTS: THE NUMBER OF YOGA-RELATED TITLES INCLUDED IN THE PUBMED DATABASE IS LIMITED UNTIL A MARKED INCREASE 2000 AND STEADY SURGE SINCE 2007. BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT MORE THAN 200 NEW TITLES ARE ADDED PER ANNUM SINCE 2011. SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND YOGA TRIALS ARE INCREASING EXPONENTIALLY, INDICATING A POTENTIAL INCREASE IN THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE. TITLES INCLUDING PAIN MANAGEMENT, STRESS OR ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND CANCER CONDITIONS ARE HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH YOGA AND HEALTHCARE RESEARCH. CONCLUSIONS: THE PREVALENCE OF YOGA RESEARCH IN WESTERN HEALTHCARE IS INCREASING. THE MARKED INCREASE IN VOLUME INDICATES THE NEED FOR MORE SYSTEMATIC ANALYSIS OF THE LITERATURE IN TERMS OF QUALITY AND RESULTS.	2014

OF THESE JOURNALS, THE JOURNAL OF ALTERNATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE HAS PUBLISHED THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF PAPERS, WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR 2.9% OF TOTAL PUBLICATIONS. THIS STUDY SHOWED A WIDE VARIETY OF JOURNALS IN WHICH YOGA-DIABETIC ARTICLES ARE PUBLISHED; THESE BIBLIOMETRIC INDICATORS PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION ON PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT OF PRODUCTIVITY AND QUALITY OF RESEARCH OUTPUT. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY PROVIDES A HELPFUL REFERENCE FOR ENDOCRINOLOGISTS, YOGA THERAPISTS, POLICY DECISION-MAKERS, AND DIABETES RESEARCHERS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
14  588  34 DETERMINING PSYCHONEUROIMMUNOLOGIC MARKERS OF YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR PERSONS DIAGNOSED WITH PTSD: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. THERE IS A GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH ON YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS OF POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) ACCOMPANIED BY SPECULATIONS ON UNDERLYING PHYSIOLOGIC MECHANISMS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW IS TO IDENTIFY, QUALITATIVELY EVALUATE, AND SYNTHESIZE STUDIES OF YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR PTSD THAT MEASURED PHYSIOLOGIC OUTCOMES IN ORDER TO GAIN INSIGHTS INTO POTENTIAL MECHANISMS. THE FOCUS IS ON STUDIES EVALUATING YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION FOR PTSD RATHER THAN FOR TRAUMA EXPOSURE, PTSD PREVENTION, OR SUBCLINICAL PTSD. MULTIPLE DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR PUBLICATIONS FROM THE PAST TWO DECADES USING TERMS DERIVED FROM THE QUESTION, "IN PEOPLE WITH PTSD, WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON OBJECTIVE OUTCOMES?" ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA INCLUDED YOGA-ONLY MODALITIES TESTED AS AN INTERVENTION FOR FORMALLY DIAGNOSED PTSD WITH AT LEAST ONE PHYSIOLOGIC OUTCOME. RESULTS OF THIS REVIEW CONFIRMED THAT, THOUGH MUCH OF THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE PROPOSES PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS UNDERLYING YOGA'S EFFECTS ON PTSD, VERY FEW STUDIES ( N = 3) HAVE ACTUALLY EVALUATED PHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE. ADDITIONALLY, SEVERAL STUDIES HAD METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS. IN LIGHT OF THE LIMITED DATA SUPPORTING YOGA'S BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM DYSREGULATION, WE PRESENT A THEORETICAL MODEL OF THE PSYCHONEUROIMMUNOLOGIC PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH PTSD AND THE EFFECTS YOGA MAY HAVE ON THESE PROCESSES TO GUIDE FUTURE RESEARCH. GAPS IN THE LITERATURE REMAIN FOR MECHANISMS RELATED TO ACTIVATION OF THE HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-ADRENAL AXIS AND INFLAMMATION. ADDITIONAL RIGOROUS MECHANISTIC STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO GUIDE DEVELOPMENT OF EFFECTIVE YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR PTSD TO AUGMENT EXISTING EVIDENCE-BASED PTSD TREATMENTS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
15 2317  27 TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA INTERVENTIONS AND POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS AND DEPRESSION OUTCOMES AMONG WOMEN: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS. RESEARCH SHOWS THAT MOST PEOPLE EXPERIENCE AT LEAST ONE TRAUMATIC EVENT IN THEIR LIFETIMES, AND BETWEEN 6% AND 8% OF THOSE WITH A HISTORY OF TRAUMA WILL DEVELOP POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) AND/OR RELATED MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. WOMEN FACE A GREATER THREAT OF TRAUMA EXPOSURE AND HAVE A HIGHER RISK OF PTSD AND DEPRESSION THAN MEN. TRAUMA-SENSITIVE YOGA (TSY), A BODY-BASED ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY, HAS SHOWN POTENTIAL IN SEVERAL STUDIES AS AN EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR REDUCING PTSD AND DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS. HOWEVER, EXISTING RESEARCH AND SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS VARY WIDELY IN THEIR METHODOLOGICAL RIGOR AND COMPARISON SAMPLES. THUS, IN THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TSY AMONG WOMEN WITH A HISTORY OF TRAUMA AND DEPRESSION WHO HAD PARTICIPATED IN RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS WITH CLEAR CONTROL AND EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS. FINDINGS IN FIXED- AND MIXED-EFFECTS META-ANALYSIS MODELS SUGGEST MARGINALLY SIGNIFICANT TO NO EFFECTS OF TSY ON PTSD AND DEPRESSION OUTCOMES. OUR SYSTEMATIC REVIEW HIGHLIGHTS CRITICAL QUESTIONS AND SIGNIFICANT GAPS IN THE EXISTING LITERATURE ABOUT THE RATIONALE AND BEST PRACTICES OF TSY INTERVENTION DURATION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
16  317  37 AN INTEGRATED METHODOLOGY TO ASSESS COMPLIANCE WITH DELPHI SURVEY KEY COMPONENTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS AS APPLIED IN A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF FIBROMYALGIA STUDIES. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS ARTICLE WAS TO PRESENT A METHODOLOGY INCORPORATING EXISTING GUIDELINES AND TOOLS FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND TO EVALUATE THE DELPHI SURVEY 33 KEY COMPONENT RECOMMENDATIONS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS AS A TOOL FOR A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW IN FIBROMYALGIA STUDIES. DATA SOURCES: DATABASES SEARCHED INCLUDED PUBMED, OVID MEDLINE, PSYCHINFO, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, CINAHL, ALT HEALTHWATCH, PEDRO, AND WEB OF SCIENCE. ARTICLE SELECTION: SELECTED WERE ARTICLES PUBLISHED BETWEEN NOVEMBER 14, 2004 AND NOVEMBER 13, 2014, WRITTEN IN ENGLISH, REPORTING ORIGINAL RESEARCH OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR ADULTS WITH FIBROMYALGIA. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: SIX ARTICLES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA, REVEALING THAT THREE YOGA STYLES ("RELAXING" YOGA, YOGA OF AWARENESS, AND HATHA YOGA) HAVE BEEN ASSESSED IN PERSONS WITH FIBROMYALGIA. OVERALL, REPORTING COMPLIANCE WITH THE 33 KEY COMPONENTS RANGED FROM 39.4% TO 84.8%, WITH A MEAN ADHERENCE RATE OF 62.63% +/- 17.74. NONE OF THE AUTHORS USED AN ACCEPTED REPORTING GUIDELINE; SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OF ASANA, PRANAYAMA, RELAXATION, AND MINDFULNESS PRACTICES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE INTERVENTIONS TESTED WERE IDENTIFIED IN ONLY 33.33% OF THE ARTICLES REVIEWED; AND NONE OF THE ARTICLES INCLUDED DETAILED, REPLICABLE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE INTERVENTIONS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW SUPPORTS THE NEED FOR COMPREHENSIVE YOGA RESEARCH GUIDELINES. FINDINGS REVEAL A LACK OF REPORTING OF INTERVENTION DETAILS, THE NEED TO REPORT A DISEASE-SPECIFIC RATIONALE FOR SELECTION OF THE PARTICULAR YOGA STYLE USED FOR THE INTERVENTION, AND THAT A LIMITED NUMBER OF YOGA STYLES HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED IN PERSONS WITH FIBROMYALGIA.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
17 1186  23 EVIDENCE BASED EFFECTS OF YOGA IN NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS. THOUGH YOGA IS ONE OF THE WIDELY USED MIND-BODY MEDICINE FOR HEALTH PROMOTION, DISEASE PREVENTION AND AS A POSSIBLE TREATMENT MODALITY FOR NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS, THERE IS A LACK OF EVIDENCE-BASED REVIEW. HENCE, WE PERFORMED A COMPREHENSIVE SEARCH IN THE PUBMED/MEDLINE ELECTRONIC DATABASE TO REVIEW RELEVANT ARTICLES IN ENGLISH, USING KEYWORDS "YOGA AND NEUROLOGICAL DISORDER, YOGA AND MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, YOGA AND STROKE, YOGA AND EPILEPSY, YOGA AND PARKINSON'S DISEASE, YOGA AND DEMENTIA, YOGA AND CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASE, YOGA AND ALZHEIMER DISEASE, YOGA AND NEUROPATHY, YOGA AND MYELOPATHY, AND YOGA AND GUILLAIN-BARRE SYNDROME". A TOTAL OF 700 ARTICLES PUBLISHED FROM 1963 TO 14TH DECEMBER 2016 WERE AVAILABLE. OF 700 ARTICLES, 94 ARTICLES WERE INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE LITERATURE, IT COULD BE CONCLUDED THAT YOGA MIGHT BE CONSIDERED AS AN EFFECTIVE ADJUVANT FOR THE PATIENTS WITH VARIOUS NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
18 1689  37 OVERVIEW OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS: YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION FOR ADULTS WITH ACUTE AND CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS. OBJECTIVES. OVERVIEW THE QUALITY, DIRECTION, AND CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR TREATMENT OF ACUTE AND CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS IN ADULT POPULATIONS. METHODS. WE SEARCHED FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS IN 10 ONLINE DATABASES, BIBLIOGRAPHIC REFERENCES, AND HAND-SEARCHES IN YOGA-RELATED JOURNALS. INCLUDED REVIEWS SATISFY OXMAN CRITERIA AND SPECIFY YOGA AS A PRIMARY INTERVENTION IN ONE OR MORE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS FOR TREATMENT IN ADULTS. THE AMSTAR TOOL AND GRADE APPROACH EVALUATED THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF REVIEWS AND QUALITY OF EVIDENCE. RESULTS. WE IDENTIFIED 2202 TITLES, OF WHICH 41 FULL-TEXT ARTICLES WERE ASSESSED FOR ELIGIBILITY AND 26 SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS SATISFIED INCLUSION CRITERIA. THIRTEEN SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS INCLUDE QUANTITATIVE DATA AND SIX PAPERS INCLUDE META-ANALYSIS. THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE IS GENERALLY LOW. SIXTEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF HEALTH CONDITIONS ARE INCLUDED. ELEVEN REVIEWS SHOW TENDENCY TOWARDS POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTION, 15 REVIEWS REPORT UNCLEAR RESULTS, AND NO, REVIEWS REPORT ADVERSE EFFECTS OF YOGA. YOGA APPEARS MOST EFFECTIVE FOR REDUCING SYMPTOMS IN ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND PAIN. CONCLUSION. ALTHOUGH THE QUALITY OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS IS HIGH, THE QUALITY OF SUPPORTING EVIDENCE IS LOW. SIGNIFICANT HETEROGENEITY AND VARIABILITY IN REPORTING INTERVENTIONS BY TYPE OF YOGA, SETTINGS, AND POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS LIMIT THE GENERALIZABILITY OF RESULTS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
19 2465  47 YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION: A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF PUBLISHED RESEARCH STUDIES FROM 1967 TO 2013. OBJECTIVE: A COMPREHENSIVE BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED ON PUBLICATIONS FOR YOGA THERAPY RESEARCH IN CLINICAL POPULATIONS. METHODS: MAJOR ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR ARTICLES IN ALL LANGUAGES PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1967 AND 2013. DATABASES INCLUDED PUBMED, PSYCHINFO, MEDLINE, INDMED, INDIAN CITATION INDEX, INDEX MEDICUS FOR SOUTH-EAST ASIA REGION, WEB OF KNOWLEDGE, EMBASE, EBSCO, AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR. NONINDEXED JOURNALS WERE SEARCHED MANUALLY. KEY SEARCH WORDS INCLUDED YOGA, YOGA THERAPY, PRANAYAMA, ASANA. ALL STUDIES MET THE DEFINITION OF A CLINICAL TRIAL. ALL STYLES OF YOGA WERE INCLUDED. THE AUTHORS EXTRACTED THE DATA. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 486 ARTICLES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA AND WERE PUBLISHED IN 217 DIFFERENT PEER-REVIEWED JOURNALS FROM 29 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES ON 28,080 STUDY PARTICIPANTS. THE PRIMARY RESULT OBSERVED IS THE THREE-FOLD INCREASE IN NUMBER OF PUBLICATIONS SEEN IN THE LAST 10 YEARS, INCLUSIVE OF ALL STUDY DESIGNS. OVERALL, 45% OF THE STUDIES PUBLISHED WERE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS, 18% WERE CONTROLLED STUDIES, AND 37% WERE UNCONTROLLED STUDIES. MOST PUBLICATIONS ORIGINATED FROM INDIA (N=258), FOLLOWED BY THE UNITED STATES (N=122) AND CANADA (N=13). THE TOP THREE DISORDERS ADDRESSED BY YOGA INTERVENTIONS WERE MENTAL HEALTH, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, AND RESPIRATORY DISEASE. CONCLUSION: A SURGE IN PUBLICATIONS ON YOGA TO MITIGATE DISEASE-RELATED SYMPTOMS IN CLINICAL POPULATIONS HAS OCCURRED DESPITE CHALLENGES FACING THE FIELD OF YOGA RESEARCH, WHICH INCLUDE STANDARDIZATION AND LIMITATIONS IN FUNDING, TIME, AND RESOURCES. THE POPULATION AT LARGE HAS OBSERVED A PARALLEL SURGE IN THE USE OF YOGA OUTSIDE OF CLINICAL PRACTICE. THE USE OF YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY IN CLINICAL PRACTICE MAY LEAD TO HEALTH BENEFITS BEYOND TRADITIONAL TREATMENT ALONE; HOWEVER, TO EFFECT CHANGES IN HEALTH CARE POLICY, MORE HIGH-QUALITY, EVIDENCE-BASED RESEARCH IS NEEDED.	2015

BACKGROUND: TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM) IS BECOMING A LEADING PROBLEM WORLDWIDE. EMERGING REPORTS REVEAL ALARMING EVIDENCE OF INCREASING PREVALENCE OF T2DM THAT HAS REACHED PANDEMIC LEVELS. DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT INCIDENCE, THERE ARE LIMITED RELIABLE DATA RESOURCES AND COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PEOPLE WHO ARE A PREDIABETIC OR HIGH RISK FOR DEVELOPING T2DM. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROTOCOL IS TO CONDUCT A FULL-SCALE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSES ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PEOPLE WHO ARE PREDIABETES OR HIGH RISK OF DEVELOPING T2DM. METHODS: THE ARTICLES ENROLLED IN THE STUDY WILL BE RETRIEVED FROM THE ONLINE DATABASES BETWEEN 2002 AND THE DATE THE SEARCHES ARE EXECUTED. THE SEARCHES WILL BE REPEATED JUST BEFORE THE FINAL ANALYSES AND FURTHER RELEVANT STUDIES FOR INCLUSION. WE WILL CONDUCT A BIBLIOGRAPHIC SEARCH IN DATABASES: MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, COCHRANE LIBRARY, EBSCO, AND INDMED USING KEYWORDS INCLUDING PREDIABETES STATE, HIGH RISK FOR DIABETES, METABOLIC SYNDROME, AND YOGA. A DEFINED SEARCH STRATEGY WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ALONG WITH SELECTION CRITERIA TO OBTAIN FULL-TEXT ARTICLES OF RELEVANT STUDIES. THIS STUDY PROTOCOL WAS PREPARED ACCORDING TO THE PREFERRED REPORTING ITEMS FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND META-ANALYSIS FOR PROTOCOLS 2015 GUIDELINES. THERE WILL BE NO LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL BE BASED ON PUBLISHED STUDIES AND PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ANONYMIZED DATA WITHOUT DIRECTLY INVOLVING HUMAN PARTICIPANTS AND THEREFORE REQUIRES NEITHER FORMAL HUMAN ETHICAL REVIEW NOR APPROVAL BY A HUMAN RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEE. WE PUBLISHED AN OUTLINE OF THE PROTOCOL IN THE INTERNATIONAL PROSPECTIVE REGISTER OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS (PROSPERO) IN 2018. WE PLAN TO DISSEMINATE THE FINDINGS OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS THROUGH PUBLICATION IN A PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL AND PRESENTATION AT RELEVANT CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS. IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE THE RESULTS OF THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WILL HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND PRACTICE. WE WILL PREPARE POLICYMAKER SUMMARY USING A VALIDATED FORMAT, DISSEMINATE THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA AND EMAIL DISCUSSION GROUPS.

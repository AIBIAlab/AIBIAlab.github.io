1  602 106 DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF A YOGA MODULE FOR PARKINSON DISEASE. BACKGROUND PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD), A PROGRESSIVE NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE, AFFECTS MOTOR AND NONMOTOR FUNCTIONS, LEADING TO SEVERE DEBILITY AND POOR QUALITY OF LIFE. STUDIES HAVE REPORTED THE BENEFICIAL ROLE OF YOGA IN ALLEVIATING THE SYMPTOMS OF PD; HOWEVER, A VALIDATED YOGA MODULE FOR PD IS UNAVAILABLE. THIS STUDY DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED AN INTEGRATED YOGA MODULE(IYM) FOR PD. METHODS THE IYM WAS PREPARED AFTER A THOROUGH REVIEW OF CLASSICAL YOGA TEXTS AND PREVIOUS FINDINGS. TWENTY EXPERIENCED YOGA EXPERTS, WHO FULFILLED THE INCLUSION CRITERIA, WERE SELECTED VALIDATING THE CONTENT OF THE IYM. A TOTAL OF 28 PRACTICES WERE INCLUDED IN THE IYM, AND EACH PRACTICE WAS DISCUSSED AND RATED AS (I) NOT ESSENTIAL, (II) USEFUL BUT NOT ESSENTIAL, AND (III) ESSENTIAL; THE CONTENT VALIDITY RATIO (CVR) WAS CALCULATED USING LAWSHE'S FORMULA. RESULTS DATA ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT OF THE 28 IYM PRACTICES, 21 EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT CONTENT VALIDITY (CUT-OFF VALUE: 0.42, AS CALCULATED BY APPLYING LAWSHE'S FORMULA FOR THE CVR). CONCLUSIONS THE IYM IS VALID FOR PD, WITH GOOD CONTENT VALIDITY. HOWEVER, FUTURE STUDIES MUST DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFICACY OF THE DEVELOPED MODULE.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
2  603  33 DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF INTEGRATED YOGA MODULE FOR OBESITY IN ADOLESCENTS. BACKGROUND: OBESITY IS A GROWING GLOBAL EPIDEMIC AND CAUSE OF NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES. YOGA IS ONE OF THE EFFECTIVE WAYS TO REDUCE STRESS WHICH IS ONE OF THE CAUSES OF OBESITY. NOWADAYS, CHILDREN IN ADOLESCENT AGE ARE MORE PRONE TO GET OBESE DUE TO LACK OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY MAKING THEM MORE SEDENTARY. AIM: TO IDENTIFY THE DESIGN AND VALIDATION OF INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY MODULE (IAYTM) FOR OBESITY IN ADOLESCENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FIRST PHASE - IAYTM FOR OBESITY WAS DESIGNED BASED ON THE LITERATURE REVIEW OF CLASSICAL TEXTS AND RECENTLY PUBLISHED RESEARCH ARTICLES. SECOND PHASE - DESIGNED IAYTM WAS VALIDATED BY 16 SUBJECT MATTER (YOGA) EXPERTS. CONTENT-VALIDITY RATIO (CVR) WAS ANALYZED USING LAWSHE'S FORMULA. RESULTS: YOGA PRACTICES WERE DESIGNED FOR INTEGRATED YOGA MODULE FOR OBESITY IN ADOLESCENTS. YOGA PRACTICES WITH CVR >/=0.5 AND WHICH WERE VALIDATED BY 16 YOGA EXPERTS AND APPROVED IN FACULTY GROUP DISCUSSION WERE INCLUDED IN FINAL INTEGRATED YOGA THERAPY MODULE. CONCLUSION: THE YOGA PRACTICES WERE DESIGNED AND VALIDATED FOR IAYTM FOR OBESITY IN ADOLESCENTS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
3 2202  25 THE ESSENTIAL PROPERTIES OF YOGA QUESTIONNAIRE (EPYQ): PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES. YOGA INTERVENTIONS ARE HETEROGENEOUS AND VARY ALONG MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS. THESE DIMENSIONS MAY AFFECT MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH OUTCOMES IN DIFFERENT WAYS OR THROUGH DIFFERENT MECHANISMS. HOWEVER, MOST STUDIES OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON HEALTH DO NOT ADEQUATELY DESCRIBE OR QUANTIFY THE COMPONENTS OF THE INTERVENTIONS BEING IMPLEMENTED. THIS LACK OF DETAIL PREVENTS RESEARCHERS FROM MAKING COMPARISONS ACROSS STUDIES AND LIMITS OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIVE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS. TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, WE DEVELOPED THE ESSENTIAL PROPERTIES OF YOGA QUESTIONNAIRE (EPYQ), WHICH ALLOWS RESEARCHERS TO OBJECTIVELY CHARACTERIZE THEIR INTERVENTIONS. WE PRESENT HERE THE RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY DATA FROM THE FINAL PHASES OF THIS MEASURE-DEVELOPMENT PROJECT. ANALYSES IDENTIFIED FOURTEEN KEY DIMENSIONS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS MEASURED BY THE EPYQ: ACCEPTANCE/COMPASSION, BANDHAS, BODY AWARENESS, BREATHWORK, INSTRUCTOR MENTION OF HEALTH BENEFITS, INDIVIDUAL ATTENTION, MEDITATION AND MINDFULNESS, MENTAL AND EMOTIONAL AWARENESS, PHYSICALITY, ACTIVE POSTURES, RESTORATIVE POSTURES, SOCIAL ASPECTS, SPIRITUALITY, AND YOGA PHILOSOPHY. THE EPYQ DEMONSTRATED GOOD RELIABILITY, AS ASSESSED BY INTERNAL CONSISTENCY AND TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY ANALYSIS, AND EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE EPYQ IS A VALID MEASURE OF MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS OF YOGA. THE MEASURE IS READY FOR USE BY CLINICIANS AND RESEARCHERS. RESULTS INDICATE THAT, CURRENTLY, TRAINED OBJECTIVE RATERS SHOULD SCORE INTERVENTIONS TO AVOID REFERENCE FRAME ERRORS AND POTENTIAL RATING BIAS, BUT ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES MAY BE DEVELOPED. THE EPYQ WILL ALLOW RESEARCHERS TO LINK SPECIFIC YOGA DIMENSIONS TO IDENTIFIABLE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND OPTIMIZE THE DESIGN OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR SPECIFIC CONDITIONS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
4  600  38 DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF 20-MIN YOGA MODULE FOR REDUCING BURNOUT AMONG HEALTHCARE WORKER(S). BACKGROUND: A HIGH PREVALENCE OF BURNOUT HAS BEEN REPORTED AMONG HEALTHCARE WORKER(S). DURING THE CURRENT PANDEMIC, SUCH BURNOUT HAS INCREASED DUE TO EXCESSIVE LOAD OF PATIENT CARE, USE OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (PPE) KITS, WORKING IN LONG SHIFTS, STAYING AWAY FROM FAMILY DUE TO ISOLATION NORMS, AND DISRUPTED SOCIAL LIFE. EXISTING YOGA TECHNIQUES USED FOR REDUCING BURNOUT INCLUDE 45 MIN TO HOUR-LONG SESSIONS, WHICH MAY NOT BE FEASIBLE FOR REGULAR PRACTICE BY THE HEALTHCARE WORKER(S). OBJECTIVE: THE PROPOSED STUDY AIMED TO DEVELOP A 20-MIN YOGA MODULE TO REDUCE BURNOUT AMONG HEALTHCARE WORKER(S). METHODS: TO DEVELOP A 20-MIN YOGA MODULE, WE REVIEWED YOGA TEXTS AND RELEVANT SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ARTICLES. COMPONENTS OF THE 20-MIN YOGA MODULE INCLUDE SUKSHMA VYAYAMA (LOOSENING EXERCISES), PRANAYAMA (REGULATED BREATHING), AND DHYANA (MEDITATION). NINETEEN YOGA EXPERTS VALIDATED THE 20-MIN YOGA MODULE WITH AN AVERAGE (SD) OF 11.47 (6.77) YEARS OF RESEARCH AND CLINICAL EXPERIENCE IN YOGA. CONTENT VALIDITY RATIO (CVR) WAS CALCULATED ACCORDING TO LAWSHE'S METHOD. ITEMS HAVING A CVR OF 0.47 AND ABOVE WERE RETAINED IN THE MODULE. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: THE CONTENT VALIDITY INDEX (CVI) OF THE ENTIRE MODULE WAS 0.83. CVR RESULTS OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE 20-MIN YOGA MODULE INDICATED THAT EXPERTS CONSIDER THESE PRACTICES TO BE ESSENTIAL FOR REDUCING BURNOUT AMONG THE HEALTHCARE WORKER(S). THE STRENGTH OF THE 20-MIN YOGA MODULE LIES IN ITS SHORT DURATION AND EASY-TO-LEARN PRACTICES. 20-MIN YOGA MODULE CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN PRACTICE BY THE HEALTHCARE WORKER(S) FOR REDUCING BURNOUT FOLLOWING EFFICACY STUDIES THROUGH FURTHER CLINICAL TRIALS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
5  582  35 DESIGNING AND VALIDATION OF A YOGA-BASED MODULE FOR OBESITY WITH METABOLIC COMORBIDITIES. OBJECTIVES: OBESITY IS A CONDITION OF INCREASED ADIPOSE TISSUE IN THE BODY, WHICH IS COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS COMORBIDITIES LIKE DIABETES, HYPERTENSION, ARTHRITIS, BACK PAIN, AND MANY OTHERS. YOGA MODULES HAVE BEEN DESIGNED AND VALIDATED FOR OBESITY; HOWEVER, WE COULDN'T FIND ANY SPECIFIC MODULE FOR METABOLIC SYNDROME, A CONDITION WHICH INCLUDES OBESITY, DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2 AND/OR HYPERTENSION TOGETHER. KEEPING THIS IN VIEW, OUR STUDY AIMED TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE A SPECIFIC GENERIC YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION MODULE FOR METABOLIC SYNDROME PATIENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A YOGA MODULE WAS DESIGNED BASED ON TRADITIONAL AND CONTEMPORARY YOGA LITERATURE AS WELL AS PUBLISHED STUDIES. WE DERIVED THE YOGA PRACTICES FOR THE MODULE, FROM THESE YOGA TEXTS AND RESEARCH EVIDENCE WERE ALREADY AVAILABLE. THE YOGA MODULE WAS SENT TO 40 YOGA EXPERTS FOR THEIR VALIDATION. RESULTS: TWENTY-TWO EXPERTS GAVE THEIR OPINION ON THE USEFULNESS OF A YOGA MODULE FOR PATIENTS WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME WITH SOME SUGGESTIONS. OF THESE EXPERTS, 73% WERE MALES, AND 27% WERE FEMALES. YOGA THERAPY PRACTICES WITH CONTENT VALIDITY RATIO (CVR) >0.08 WERE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL MODULE. IN TOTAL, 86% (31 OF 36 ITEMS) OF THE ITEMS IN THE INITIAL MODULE WERE RETAINED. CONCLUSION: A SPECIFIC YOGA-BASED MODULE FOR METABOLIC SYNDROME WAS DESIGNED AND VALIDATED BY EXPERTS. FURTHER STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM THE EFFICACY AND CLINICAL UTILITY OF THE MODULE.ADDITIONAL CLINICAL VALIDATION IS SUGGESTED.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
6  605  36 DEVELOPMENT AND VALIDATION OF YOGA MODULE FOR ANGER MANAGEMENT IN ADOLESCENTS. BACKGROUND: DEVELOPMENT OF ANGER MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS AND IN PARTICULAR, YOGA MODULE FOR ANGER MANAGEMENT HAS NOT BEEN WELL RESEARCHED. BEING A COMPLEX EMOTION, ANGER POSES SERIOUS CHALLENGES IN DEVELOPING A COMPREHENSIVE ANGER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. WHILE VARIOUS THEORIES OF ANGER ARE DEALT IN MODERN PSYCHOLOGY, SEVERAL ANGER MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES ARE SET FORTH IN INDIAN TRADITIONAL TEXTS. YOGA, WHICH IS CONSIDERED AS A HOLISTIC AND INTEGRATED APPROACH IS EXPLORED IN THIS STUDY TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE A SCHOOL-BASED YOGA PROGRAM FOR ANGER MANAGEMENT IN ADOLESCENCE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: INTEGRATED APPROACH TO YOGA THERAPY (IAYT) PRINCIPLES AND LITERARY REVIEW FORMED THE BASIS FOR DERIVING THE CONCEPTS OF ANGER MANAGEMENT. THE METHODOLOGY INCLUDES CONSTRUCTION OF THE YOGA MODULE, VALIDATION OF THE MODULE BY 22 EXPERTS FOLLOWED BY A PILOT NON-RANDOMISED CONTROL STUDY (N-50) TO ASSESS FEASIBILITY AND INITIAL EFFECTIVENESS. CONTENT VALIDITY RATIO (CVR) AND PAIRED T-TEST WERE EMPLOYED TO ANALYSE THE EXPERTS' RATING AND PILOT-STUDY DATA RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS: EMERGENCE OF IAYT BASED YOGA PROGRAM FOR ANGER MANAGEMENT. BASED ON CVR RATIO, 16 OUT OF 18 YOGIC TECHNIQUES QUALIFIED FOR THE FINAL MODULE. THE PILOT STUDY REVEALED VIABILITY OF THE MODULE AND ITS RECOGNITION AS AN ANGER MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF ANGER SCORES IN YOGA GROUP SUBSTANTIATES INITIAL EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MODULE. CONCLUSION: THE DEVELOPED AND VALIDATED YOGA MODULE FOR ANGER MANAGEMENT IS RECOGNISED AS A WELL-ACCEPTED AND EFFECTIVE YOGA PROGRAM FOR ANGER MANAGEMENT IN ADOLESCENTS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
7 2203  33 THE ESSENTIAL PROPERTIES OF YOGA QUESTIONNAIRE: DEVELOPMENT AND METHODS. YOGA INTERVENTIONS HAVE CONSIDERABLE HETEROGENEITY, ARE MULTI-DIMENSIONAL, AND MAY IMPACT HEALTH IN DIFFERENT WAYS. HOWEVER, MOST RESEARCH REPORTS REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON HEALTH AND WELLBEING DO NOT ADEQUATELY DESCRIBE THE COMPONENTS OF THE YOGA INTERVENTIONS BEING USED. THUS, DRAWING COMPARISONS ACROSS STUDIES OR UNDERSTANDING THE RELATIVE EFFECTS OF SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF A YOGA INTERVENTION ARE RARELY POSSIBLE. TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, WE CREATED THE ESSENTIAL PROPERTIES OF YOGA QUESTIONNAIRE (EPYQ) PROJECT, AN NCCAM-FUNDED SET OF STUDIES TO DEVELOP A TRANSLATIONAL TOOL FOR YOGA RESEARCHERS. HERE WE DESCRIBE THE METHODS AND DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESSES USED IN THE EPYQ PROJECT IN DETAIL. THE PROJECT CONSISTS OF FOUR MAIN PHASES. PHASE I WAS DESIGNED TO GAIN A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELEVANT ASPECTS OF YOGA BY CONDUCTING A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW AND CONDUCTING FOCUS GROUPS WITH STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING A WIDE VARIETY OF YOGA TEACHERS AND STUDENTS. IN PHASE II, A POOL OF POTENTIAL QUESTIONNAIRE ITEMS WAS DEVELOPED FOR THE PROTOTYPIC QUESTIONNAIRE USING INFORMATION FROM PHASE I. COGNITIVE INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH THE PRELIMINARY EPYQ ITEMS TO ASSESS THE PERCEIVED CLARITY, MEANING, AND IMPORTANCE OF EACH ITEM. IN PHASE III, THE PROTOTYPIC QUESTIONNAIRE WAS ADMINISTERED TO TWO LARGE SAMPLES OF YOGA STUDENTS AND INSTRUCTORS. MILITARY PERSONNEL AND VETERANS WHO PRACTICED OR TAUGHT YOGA (N = 329) WERE RECRUITED TO PARTICIPATE. FACTOR ANALYSIS AND ITEM RESPONSE THEORY WERE USED TO IDENTIFY FACTORS AND SELECT THE FINAL QUESTIONNAIRE ITEMS. PHASE IV IS ONGOING AND WILL COLLECT RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY DATA ON THE FINAL INSTRUMENT. RESULTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE AVAILABLE IN 2016.

8  544  48 CONTENT VALIDITY OF AN INTEGRATED YOGA MODULE FOR PRACTICE DURING REMISSION IN RELAPSING-REMITTING MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PATIENTS. BACKGROUND: SOME INVESTIGATIONS POINT TO THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA IN ALLEVIATING THE MOTOR AND COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTIONS IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) PATIENTS BY USING VARYING COMBINATIONS OF PHYSICAL, BREATHING, AND MEDITATIVE PRACTICES OF YOGA. THERE IS A NEED FOR A VALIDATED YOGA MODULE WITH A HOLISTIC APPROACH THAT CAN BE USED AS A STANDARDIZED PROTOCOL BY RESEARCHERS AND THERAPISTS. PURPOSE: TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE AN INTEGRATED YOGA MODULE FOR PRACTICE IN RELAPSING-REMITTING MS PATIENTS TO IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE. METHODS: WE DID A THOROUGH REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE YOGA MODULE. WE FORMED AN EXPERT GROUP WITH 24 EXPERTS AND A NEUROLOGIST AND USED TWO ROUNDS OF INTERACTIVE DELPHI METHOD TO COMBINE THEIR OPINION TO OBTAIN CONTENT VALIDITY OF THE MODULE THROUGH ONLINE STRUCTURED QUESTIONNAIRE PREPARED FOR THE PURPOSE ON A GOOGLE FORM. WE INCORPORATED ALL SUGGESTIONS OBTAINED BY THE EXPERTS. THE FINAL MODULE (60 MIN PER SESSION, TWICE A DAY, FIVE DAYS PER WEEK) INCLUDED WARM-UP EXERCISES, CUSTOMIZED ASANAS, RELAXATION TECHNIQUES, AND OM MEDITATION. ADVICE ON YOGIC DIET AND DISCUSSION USING YOGIC CONCEPTS FOR STRESS MANAGEMENT ALSO FORM A PART OF THE HOLISTIC APPROACH TO YOGA LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION. RESULTS: ANALYSIS DIVULGED THAT 30 OUT OF 39 PRACTICES EXHIBITED A CONTENT VALIDITY RATIO VALUE GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 0.42. CONCLUSION: THE STUDY HAS SHOWN GOOD CONTENT VALIDITY OF THE INTEGRATED YOGA MODULE. FUTURE CLINICAL STUDIES ARE BEING PLANNED TO RULE THE FEASIBILITY AND RELIABILITY OF THIS MODULE.	2021

10  581  31 DESIGNING AND VALIDATION OF A YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA. CONTEXT: SCHIZOPHRENIA IS A CHRONIC MENTAL ILLNESS WHICH CAUSES SIGNIFICANT DISTRESS AND DYSFUNCTION. YOGA HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE AS AN ADD-ON THERAPY IN SCHIZOPHRENIA. MODULES OF YOGA USED IN PREVIOUS STUDIES WERE BASED ON INDIVIDUAL RESEARCHER'S EXPERIENCE. AIM: THIS STUDY AIMED TO DEVELOP AND VALIDATE A SPECIFIC GENERIC YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION MODULE FOR PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT NIMHANS INTEGRATED CENTRE FOR YOGA (NICY). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A YOGA MODULE WAS DESIGNED BASED ON TRADITIONAL AND CONTEMPORARY YOGA LITERATURE AS WELL AS PUBLISHED STUDIES. THE YOGA MODULE ALONG WITH THREE CASE VIGNETTES OF ADULT PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA WAS SENT TO 10 YOGA EXPERTS FOR THEIR VALIDATION. RESULTS: EXPERTS (N = 10) GAVE THEIR OPINION ON THE USEFULNESS OF A YOGA MODULE FOR PATIENTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA WITH SOME MODIFICATIONS. IN TOTAL, 87% (13 OF 15 ITEMS) OF THE ITEMS IN THE INITIAL MODULE WERE RETAINED, WITH MODIFICATION IN THE REMAINDER AS SUGGESTED BY THE EXPERTS. CONCLUSION: A SPECIFIC YOGA-BASED MODULE FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA WAS DESIGNED AND VALIDATED BY EXPERTS. FURTHER STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM EFFICACY AND CLINICAL UTILITY OF THE MODULE. ADDITIONAL CLINICAL VALIDATION IS SUGGESTED.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
11 1280  20 GENERIC YOGA MODULES FOR CLINICAL AND RESEARCH SETTINGS-NEED OF THE HOUR. YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS OFFER SIGNIFICANT PROMISE IN HEALTHCARE. HOWEVER, META-ANALYSES OF VARIOUS YOGA TRIALS SUGGEST THAT COMPARISONS OF TRIALS ARE EITHER NOT POSSIBLE OR DIFFICULT DUE TO HETEROGENEITY IN THERAPEUTIC YOGA INTERVENTIONS. ALSO, IN VIEW OF EMERGING EVIDENCE FOR THE ROLE OF THERAPEUTIC YOGA, IT IS IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY THE SPECIFICITY AND VALIDITY OF VARIOUS YOGA COMPONENTS BEING USED IN DIFFERENT TRIALS. EFFORTS IN THIS DIRECTION WILL BE FRUITFUL ONLY IF A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH IS ADOPTED TO DEVELOP YOGA PROGRAMS FOR VARIOUS AILMENTS. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR A "GENERIC YOGA" CONCEPT FOR DESIGNING A THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM FOR PARTICULAR HEALTH ISSUES, WITH THE OBJECTIVES OF PROMOTING SCIENTIFIC GROWTH OF THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS OF YOGA AND WIDESPREAD APPLICATION OF STANDARDIZED THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAMS WITHIN A BIOMEDICAL FRAMEWORK. THIS GENERIC THERAPEUTIC YOGA WILL ESSENTIALLY HIGHLIGHT THE DEVELOPMENT-VALIDATION PROCESS OF UNCOPYRIGHTED YOGA PROGRAMS; THEIR COMPONENTS, BENEFITS, AND POSSIBLE SIDE-EFFECTS; AND REQUIREMENT FOR NEED-BASED MODIFICATIONS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
12 2723  45 YOGA MODULE FOR SOMATOFORM PAIN DISORDERS: DEVELOPMENT, CONTENT VALIDATION, AND FEASIBILITY TESTING. BACKGROUND: YOGA PRACTICES HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE USEFUL IN CHRONIC PAIN CONDITIONS BUT STUDIES FOCUSSING SPECIFICALLY ON SOMATOFORM PAIN DISORDERS (SPDS) ARE LIMITED. AIMS: CURRENT STUDY AIMS TO DEVELOP AND TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA PROGRAM FOR PATIENTS WITH SPDS. MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY: ATHOROUGH SEARCH OF TRADITIONAL AND CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE WAS PERFORMED WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF FORMULATING A YOGA PROGRAM FOR REDUCING CHRONIC NON-SPECIFIC PAIN AND ASSOCIATED PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. CONTENT VALIDITY OF THE PROGRAM WAS THEN DETERMINED BY TAKING THE OPINION OF 18 YOGA EXPERTS (WHO HAD >5 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN TREATING MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS) USING CONTENT VALIDATION RATIO (CVR) THROUGH LAWSHE'S FORMULA. THE FEASIBILITY OF THE MODULE WAS TESTED ON 10 SUBJECTS DIAGNOSED WITH SPDS AS PER THE INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES (ICD) -10 CRITERIA USING STANDARD SCALES. RESULTS: IN THE FINALIZED MODULE, 70.83% (34 OUT OF 48 ITEMS) OF THE PRACTICES WERE RETAINED ALONG WITH THE MODIFICATIONS AS SUGGESTED BY THE EXPERTS. TWO PRACTICES WERE NOT FOUND TO BE FEASIBLE (TRIKONASANA AND SHALABHASANA) AND HENCE WERE REMOVED FROM THE FINAL MODULE. A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PAIN SEVERITY WAS OBSERVED IN THE SUBJECTS AFTER PRACTISING THE YOGA MODULE FOR 2 WEEKS. THE CONTENT VALIDITY INDEX FOR THE WHOLE MODULE (AVERAGE OF ALL CVRS) WAS 0.55. CONCLUSIONS: AYOGA MODULE WAS DEVELOPED FOR SPD. THE CONTENT VALIDITY OF THE MODULE WAS FOUND TO BE GOOD. THE MODULE WAS FOUND SAFE AND POTENTIALLY USEFUL FOR REDUCING PAIN SEVERITY IN PATIENTS WITH SPD. FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD TEST THE EFFICACY OF THE DEVELOPED PROGRAM THROUGH A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
13 2807  24 YOGA THERAPY RESEARCH: A WHOLE-SYSTEMS PERSPECTIVE ON COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS AND PATIENT-CENTERED OUTCOMES. FOR THE YOGA RESEARCH COMMUNITY TO CAPITALIZE ON ITS CURRENT MOMENTUM, IT IS CRITICAL TO CONSIDER CERTAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESEARCH THEORY AND INNOVATIVE METHODOLOGIES. THE CONCEPT OF MODEL VALIDITY MUST BE INCORPORATED IN YOGA THERAPY RESEARCH SO THAT EXPLANATORY CONSTRUCTS EMPLOYED AND OUTCOME MEASURES CHOSEN REFLECT THE PRINCIPLES OF TRADITIONAL YOGIC SCIENCE. FOCUSING ON EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH WILL ENSURE MAXIMUM GENERALIZABILITY OF STUDY RESULTS AND REFLECT REAL-WORLD THERAPY DELIVERY SETTINGS, THEREBY INCREASING THE RELEVANCE OF OUTCOMES. WHOLE SYSTEMS OF HEALING REQUIRE RESEARCH METHODOLOGIES THAT ADDRESS COMPLEX RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MULTI-TARGET THERAPIES WITH MULTIPLE POTENTIAL TREATMENT RESULTS. COMPLEX, DYNAMIC SYSTEMS THEORY PROVIDES THE THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS NECESSARY TO DESIGN STUDIES, CHOOSE OUTCOMES, AND ANALYZE DATA IN A WAY THAT CAN ACCOUNT FOR CHARTING COMPLEX, CYCLICAL, THERAPEUTIC TRAJECTORIES ACROSS TIME. EMPHASIZING PATIENT-CENTERED OUTCOMES IS ALIGNED WITH THE PATENT-ORIENTED AND TAILORED NATURED OF YOGA THERAPY DELIVERY. INCREASING THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH TO ANALYZE THE HARMS AND BENEFITS OF CONTRASTING THERAPIES CAN PROVIDE AN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR DESIGNING STUDIES THAT CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT PRACTICAL IMPACT. THE CREATION OF PRACTICE-BASED RESEARCH NETWORKS WITHIN THE YOGA RESEARCH COMMUNITY WILL INCENTIVIZE LINKS BETWEEN MAINSTREAM CLINICAL RESEARCHERS AND YOGA THERAPY DELIVERY SETTINGS, ULTIMATELY DEVELOPING COLLABORATIVE NETWORKS. YOGA THERAPY CENTERS CAN FACILITATE PATIENT RECRUITMENT FOR STUDIES AND INFORM STANDARDS FOR YOGA RESEARCHERS. COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS BETWEEN THE YOGA AND AYURVEDIC RESEARCH COMMUNITIES WILL STREAMLINE EFFORTS, SOLIDIFY EXPERTISE, CROSS-POLLINATE THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL INNOVATION, AND CONSOLIDATE EFFORTS TO SECURE RESEARCH FUNDING AND INCREASE PUBLICATION AND DISSEMINATION OF STUDY FINDINGS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
14  584  50 DESIGNING, VALIDATION, AND FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA MODULE FOR PATIENTS WITH ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS. BACKGROUND: ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS (AS) IS A CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASE THAT CAUSES SIGNIFICANT DISABILITY AND REDUCED QUALITY OF LIFE. SCIENTIFIC STUDIES ON YOGA HAVE REVEALED ITS VARIOUS HEALTH BENEFITS IN CHRONIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES. HOWEVER, WHETHER YOGA IS FEASIBLE FOR AS PATIENTS OR NOT IS NOT STUDIED. FURTHER, NO VALIDATED YOGA MODULE IS AVAILABLE FOR AS PATIENTS. OBJECTIVE(S): THIS STUDY INTENDED TO DEVELOP A YOGA MODULE FOR AS PATIENTS AND INVESTIGATED ITS FEASIBILITY OF USE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE STUDY WAS COMPLETED IN THREE STAGES. IN STAGE I, SIX YOGA EXPERTS PREPARED A LIST OF 64 YOGA PRACTICES BASED ON THE CLASSICAL AND CONTEMPORARY YOGIC LITERATURE REVIEW. OF THESE PRACTICES, 41 WERE INCLUDED IN THE DESIGNED YOGA MODULE. IN STAGE II, 41 EXPERTS WITH A MINIMUM OF FIVE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN YOGA THERAPY WERE INVITED FOR YOGA MODULE VALIDATION. THE USEFULNESS OF THE PRACTICES WAS RATED BY EXPERTS ON A 3-POINT SCALE (1: NOT AT ALL USEFUL, 2: MODERATELY USEFUL, AND 3: VERY MUCH USEFUL). THE LAWSHE CONTENT VALIDITY RATIO (CVR) METHOD WAS USED FOR THE CONTENT VALIDITY OF THE YOGA MODULE. PRACTICES WITH A CVR SCORE OF > 0.3 WERE RETAINED IN THE FINAL YOGA MODULE. IN STAGE III, A CERTIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTOR ADMINISTERED THE VALIDATED YOGA MODULE TO 19 AS PATIENTS (AVERAGE AGE: 35.5 +/- 10.7 YEARS) THRICE WEEKLY FOR A MONTH. FEASIBILITY WAS ASSESSED ON THE BASIS OF THE ATTRITION RATE, RETENTION RATE, ATTENDANCE OF THE PARTICIPANTS, AND THE SUBJECTIVE RESPONSE ON PRACTICAL SESSIONS USING A STRUCTURED CHECKLIST. RESULTS: OF THE 41 PRACTICES IN THE MODULE, 31 HAD A CVR SCORE OF > 0.3 AND WERE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL YOGA MODULE. OF THE 25 PARTICIPANTS, 19 (76%) COMPLETED THE STUDY WHILE SIX DROPPED OUT (24%). NINETEEN PATIENTS REPORTED GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN PAIN AND FLEXIBILITY. THEY FOUND YOGA RELAXING AND EASY TO PRACTICE. MOST PARTICIPANTS (65%) WERE ABLE TO PRACTICE A MINIMUM OF 30 MIN/DAY. CONCLUSION: THE PRESENT STUDY OFFERS A VALIDATED YOGA MODULE CONSISTING OF 31 PRACTICES FOR AS PATIENTS. THE RESULTS OF THE PILOT SUGGESTED THAT THE MODULE IS FEASIBLE, ACCEPTABLE, AND EASY TO PRACTICE FOR AS PATIENTS. WE RECOMMEND THAT AS PATIENTS SHOULD PRACTICE THIS YOGA MODULE FOR A MINIMUM OF 30 MIN EVERY DAY UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A YOGA EXPERT.	2022	

15 2048  29 THE AFRICA YOGA PROJECT: A PARTICIPANT-DRIVEN CONCEPT MAP OF KENYAN TEACHERS' REPORTED EXPERIENCES. OBJECTIVE: THE AFRICA YOGA PROJECT (AYP) TRAINS AND FUNDS KENYANS TO TEACH COMMUNITY YOGA CLASSES. PRELIMINARY RESEARCH WITH A SMALL SAMPLE OF AYP TEACHERS SUGGESTED THE PROGRAM HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT. THIS STUDY USED CONCEPT MAPPING TO EXPLORE THE EXPERIENCES OF A LARGER SAMPLE. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS BRAINSTORMED STATEMENTS ABOUT HOW PRACTICING AND/OR TEACHING YOGA CHANGED THEM. THEY SORTED STATEMENTS INTO SELF-DEFINED PILES AND RATED THEM IN TERMS OF PERCEIVED IMPORTANCE. MULTIDIMENSIONAL SCALING (MDS) OF SORT DATA CALCULATED STATEMENT COORDINATES WHEREIN EACH STATEMENT IS PLACED IN PROXIMITY TO OTHER STATEMENTS AS A FUNCTION OF HOW FREQUENTLY STATEMENTS ARE SORTED TOGETHER BY PARTICIPANTS. THESE RESULTS ARE THEN AND MAPPED IN A TWO-DIMENSIONAL SPACE. HIERARCHICAL CLUSTER ANALYSIS (HCA) OF THESE DATA IDENTIFIED CLUSTERS (I.E., CONCEPTS) AMONG STATEMENTS. CLUSTER AVERAGE IMPORTANCE RATINGS GAVE THE CONCEPT MAP DEPTH AND INDICATED CONCEPT IMPORTANCE. BRIDGING ANALYSIS AND RESEARCHERS' CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF YOGA LITERATURE FACILITATED HCA INTERPRETIVE DECISIONS. RESULTS: OF 72 AYP TEACHERS, 52 AND 48 TEACHERS PARTICIPATED IN BRAINSTORMING AND SORTING/RATING ACTIVITIES, RESPECTIVELY. TEACHERS BRAINSTORMED 93 STATEMENTS ABOUT HOW THEY HAD CHANGED. THE RESULTANT MDS STATEMENT MAP HAD ADEQUATE VALIDITY (STRESS VALUE = .29). HCA CREATED A 12-CLUSTER SOLUTION WITH THE FOLLOWING CONCEPTS OF PERCEIVED CHANGE: IDENTITY AS A YOGA TEACHER; PROSOCIAL DEVELOPMENT; EXISTENTIAL POSSIBILITY; GENUINE POSITIVE REGARD; VALUE AND RESPECT FOR OTHERS (HIGHEST IMPORTANCE); PRESENCE, ACCEPTANCE, AND COMPETENCE; SERVICE AND TRUST; NON-JUDGMENT AND EMOTION REGULATION (LOWEST IMPORTANCE); ENGAGEMENT AND CONNECTION; INTERPERSONAL EFFECTIVENESS; PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING; AND PHYSICAL COMPETENCE AND SECURITY. CONCLUSIONS: TEACHERS PERCEIVED THE AYP AS FACILITATING CHANGE ACROSS PHYSICAL, MENTAL, AND SPIRITUAL DOMAINS. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO QUANTIFY AND COMPARE THIS CHANGE TO OTHER HEALTH PROMOTION PROGRAM OUTCOMES.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
16 2355  67 VALIDATION OF YOGA MODULE FOR CHILDREN WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES. BACKGROUND: CHILDREN WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES GENERALLY EXPERIENCE MORE PAIN THAN THE NORMAL CHILDREN DUE TO CHRONIC SYSTEMIC CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR DISABILITY. DESCRIPTION OF PAIN IS GENERALLY DIFFICULT IN CHILDREN AND MORE SO IN CHILDREN WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES (IDS). YOGA HAS BEEN REGARDED AS A KIND OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AS WELL AS A PAIN MANAGEMENT STRATEGY. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE REPORTED THE BENEFICIAL ROLE OF YOGA IN ENHANCING PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOMOTOR ABILITIES OF IDS; HOWEVER, A VALIDATED YOGA MODULE (YM) FOR IDS IS UNAVAILABLE. THE PRESENT STUDY IS AIMED AT DEVELOPING A VALIDATED YM FOR CHILDREN WITH IDS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE CONTENT VALIDITY OF YM FOR CHILDREN WITH IDS WAS ASSESSED BY A PANEL OF 22 EXPERIENCED YOGA EXPERTS. THE YM FOR CHILDREN WITH IDS WAS DEVELOPED IN THE FORM OF TAILOR-MADE YOGA PRACTICES THAT WERE SUPPORTED BY CLASSICAL TEXTS AND RESEARCH EVIDENCE. A TOTAL OF 32 PRACTICES WERE INCLUDED IN THE YM, AND EACH PRACTICE WAS DISCUSSED AND RATED AS (I) NOT ESSENTIAL, (II) USEFUL BUT NOT ESSENTIAL, AND (III) ESSENTIAL. THE CONTENT VALIDITITY RATIOWAS CALCULATED USING LAWSHE'S FORMULA. RESULTS: DATA ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT OUT OF 32 YM PRACTICES, 31 INDICATED SIGNIFICANT CONTENT VALIDITY (CUTOFF VALUE: 0.42, AS CALCULATED BY APPLYING LAWSHE'S FORMULA FOR THE CVR). CONCLUSIONS: THE PRESENT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THE YM FOR CHILDREN WITH IDS IS VALID WITH GOOD CONTENT VALIDITY. HOWEVER, FUTURE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS MUST DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFICACY OF THE DEVELOPED YM FOR CHILDREN WITH IDS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
17  578  37 DESIGN AND VALIDATION OF INTEGRATED YOGA THERAPY MODULE FOR ANTARCTIC EXPEDITIONERS. BACKGROUND: EXTREME ENVIRONMENTS ARE INHERENTLY STRESSFUL AND ARE CHARACTERIZED BY A VARIETY OF PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESSORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ISOLATION, CONFINEMENT, SOCIAL TENSIONS, MINIMAL POSSIBILITY OF MEDICAL EVACUATION, BOREDOM, MONOTONY, AND DANGER. PREVIOUS RESEARCH STUDIES RECOMMEND ADAPTATION TO THE ENVIRONMENT TO MAINTAIN OPTIMAL FUNCTION AND REMAIN HEALTHY. DIFFERENT INTERVENTIONS HAVE BEEN TRIED IN THE PAST FOR EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF STRESS. YOGA PRACTICES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR COPING WITH STRESS AND ENHANCE QUALITY OF LIFE, SLEEP AND IMMUNE STATUS. OBJECTIVE: THE CURRENT ARTICLE DESCRIBES PREPARATION OF A YOGA MODULE FOR BETTER MANAGEMENT OF STRESSORS IN EXTREME ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION OF ANTARCTICA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A YOGA MODULE WAS DESIGNED BASED ON THE TRADITIONAL AND CONTEMPORARY YOGA LITERATURE AS WELL AS PUBLISHED STUDIES. THE YOGA MODULE WAS SENT FOR VALIDATION TO FORTY EXPERTS OF WHICH THIRTY RESPONDED. RESULTS: EXPERTS (N = 30) GAVE THEIR OPINION ON THE USEFULNESS OF THE YOGA MODULE. IN TOTAL 29 OUT OF 30 PRACTICES WERE RETAINED. THE AVERAGE CONTENT VALIDITY RATIO AND INTRA CLASS CORRELATION OF THE ENTIRE MODULE WAS 0.89 & 0.78 RESPECTIVELY. CONCLUSION: A SPECIFIC YOGA MODULE FOR COPING AND FACILITATING ADAPTATION IN ANTARCTICA WAS DESIGNED AND VALIDATED. THIS MODULE WAS USED IN THE 35TH INDIAN SCIENTIFIC EXPEDITION TO ANTARCTICA, AND EXPERIMENTS ARE UNDERWAY TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFICACY AND UTILITY OF YOGA ON PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS, SLEEP, SERUM BIOMARKERS AND GENE EXPRESSION. FURTHER OUTCOMES SHALL PROVIDE THE EFFICACY AND UTILITY OF THIS MODULE IN ANTARCTIC ENVIRONMENTS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
18  491  24 CO-DESIGNING A NEW YOGA-BASED MINDFULNESS INTERVENTION FOR SURVIVORS OF STROKE: A FORMATIVE EVALUATION. MOVEMENT-BASED MINDFULNESS INTERVENTIONS (MBI) ARE COMPLEX, MULTI-COMPONENT INTERVENTIONS FOR WHICH THE DESIGN PROCESS IS RARELY REPORTED. FOR PEOPLE WITH STROKE, EMERGING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS BENEFITS, BUT MAINSTREAM PROGRAMS ARE GENERALLY UNSUITABLE. WE AIMED TO DESCRIBE THE PROCESSES INVOLVED AND TO CONDUCT A FORMATIVE EVALUATION OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NOVEL YOGA-BASED MBI DESIGNED FOR SURVIVORS OF STROKE. WE USED THE MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL COMPLEX INTERVENTIONS FRAMEWORK AND PRINCIPLES OF CO-DESIGN. WE PURPOSEFULLY APPROACHED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND CONSUMERS TO ESTABLISH AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR DEVELOPING THE INTERVENTION. MEMBERS COLLABORATED AND ITERATIVELY REVIEWED THE DESIGN AND CONTENT OF THE PROGRAM, FORMATTED INTO A TRAINING MANUAL. FOUR EXTERNAL YOGA TEACHERS INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWED THE PROGRAM. FORMATIVE EVALUATION INCLUDED REVIEW OF MULTIPLE DATA SOURCES AND DOCUMENTATION (E.G., FORMAL MEETING MINUTES, FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS, RESEARCHER OBSERVATIONS). THE DATA WERE SYNTHESIZED USING INDUCTIVE THEMATIC ANALYSIS. THREE BROAD THEMES EMERGED: (A) MBI CONTENT AND TERMINOLOGY; (B) MANUAL DESIGN AND READABILITY; AND (C) BARRIERS AND ENABLERS TO DELIVER THE INTERVENTION. VARIOUS PERSPECTIVES AND FEEDBACK ON ESSENTIAL COMPONENTS GUIDED FINALIZING THE PROGRAM. THE DESIGN PHASE OF A NOVEL YOGA-BASED MBI WAS STRENGTHENED BY INTERDISCIPLINARY, CONSUMER CONTRIBUTIONS AND PEER REVIEW. THE 12-WEEK INTERVENTION IS READY FOR TESTING AMONG SURVIVORS OF STROKE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
19 1294  19 GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPING YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR RANDOMIZED TRIALS. LITTLE GUIDANCE IS AVAILABLE TO ASSIST RESEARCHERS IN DEVELOPING TREATMENT PROTOCOLS FOR RESEARCH ON YOGA FOR HEALTH CONCERNS. BECAUSE YOGA IS A COMPLEX MULTIFACTORIAL MIND-BODY DISCIPLINE HISTORICALLY DEVELOPED FOR NONMEDICAL PURPOSES, NUMEROUS DECISIONS MUST BE MADE IN ORDER TO THOUGHTFULLY DEVELOP SUCH PROTOCOLS. IN THIS PAPER, A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH IS PROPOSED TO ASSIST RESEARCHERS IN SELECTING AN INTERVENTION THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE CONDITION UNDER CONSIDERATION AND EXPLICITLY DEVELOPED. RESEARCHERS NEED TO CONSIDER THE TYPE OR "STYLE" OF YOGA, THE COMPONENTS TO INCLUDE (E.G., BREATHING EXERCISES, POSTURES) AS WELL AS THE SPECIFIC PROTOCOL FOR EACH COMPONENT, THE DOSE TO BE DELIVERED (FREQUENCY, DURATION OF PRACTICE, AND THE TOTAL DURATION OF PRACTICE), AND ISSUES RELATED TO SELECTION OF INSTRUCTORS AND MONITORING THE FIDELITY TO THE INTERVENTION. EACH OF THESE DOMAINS AND THE KEY ISSUES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROTOCOLS IS DISCUSSED. FINALLY, SOME AREAS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH RELATED TO PROTOCOL DEVELOPMENT ARE RECOMMENDED.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
20  611  33 DEVELOPMENT OF A YOGA MODULE TARGETING CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH FOR PATIENTS WITH POST-MYOCARDIAL LEFT VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION IN INDIA. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS KNOWN TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH. THIS PAPER DESCRIBES THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEED-BASED YOGA PROGRAM WHICH IS SUITABLE TO BE INTEGRATED INTO THE CARDIAC REHABILITATION OF POST-MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION PATIENTS WITH LEFT VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BASED ON THE ASSESSMENT OF THE NEED OF THE PATIENTS, LITERATURE REVIEW, AND EXPERT OPINION, A YOGA MODULE WAS DEVELOPED USING THE QUALITATIVE METHOD OF INQUIRY. THE PROGRAM INCLUDED WARM-UP EXERCISES, YOGIC ASANAS, PRANAYAMA, MEDITATION AND COUNSELING SESSIONS. A STRUCTURED QUESTIONNAIRE ELICITING COMMENTS ON THE CONTENTS WAS GIVEN INDEPENDENTLY TO TEN EXPERTS WORKING IN THE FIELD OF HEALTH AND YOGA FOR VALIDATION. THE FINAL MODULE WAS DERIVED AFTER INCORPORATING THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE EXPERTS. RESULTS: USING THE RATERS' EXPERTISE IN CARDIOLOGY AND YOGA PRACTICE, THE PRACTICES WHICH CONSTITUTE THE MODULE WERE OPTIMIZED. MAJORITY OF THE EXPERTS (RATERS) AGREED WITH THE DURATION OF 1 H TRAINING FOR 1MONTH UNDER SUPERVISION AS ADEQUATE FOR SUBSEQUENT PRACTICE AT HOME. THERE WAS A 0.786 INTER-RATER RELIABILITY ESTIMATED USING THE INTERCLASS COEFFICIENT (ICC) AND 0.789 INTERNAL CONSISTENCY OF THE QUESTIONS, MEASURED USING CRONBACH'S ALPHA. BOTH VALUES INDICATE "GOOD" RELIABILITY AND CONSISTENCY OF THE YOGA MODULE. CONCLUSION: THE DEVELOPED YOGA MODULE WAS FOUND TO BE ACCEPTABLE. FUTURE RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS WILL BE NECESSARY TO VALIDATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS MODULE AND IF THE MODULE DEMONSTRATES TO BE EFFECTIVE BY CLINICAL STUDIES, IT MAY ADD A THERAPEUTIC OPTION IN THE REHABILITATION OF PATIENTS WITH HEART FAILURE FOLLOWING MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION, WHICH CAN BE APPLIED IN THE HOSPITALS AND COMMUNITY LEVEL.	2019

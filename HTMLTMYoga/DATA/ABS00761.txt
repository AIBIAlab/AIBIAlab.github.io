1  761 161 EFFECT OF SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA (SKY) ON DAYTIME AND SITUATIONAL SLEEP PROPENSITY IN NOVICE PRACTITIONERS: A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY. OBJECTIVES: HECTIC, LATE-NIGHT LIFESTYLE HAS REDUCED 90 MIN SLEEP IN 20% ADULTS RESULTING IN INSOMNIA AND EXCESSIVE DAYTIME SLEEPINESS (EDS). WE ASSESS THE SCOPE OF SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA (SKY), A 4-COMPONENT, BREATHING PROCESS IN REDUCING EDS, GENERALLY AND SITUATIONALLY. METHODS: THIS IS A PROSPECTIVE, CONTROLLED STUDY INVOLVING RANDOMIZED SUBJECTS WITHOUT ANY SLEEP-WAKE CYCLE ANOMALIES AND PRIOR EXPERIENCE IN SKY. SUBJECTS (N=52) PERFORMED 30 MIN OF SKY FOR 6 DAYS/WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS, WHILE CONTROLS (N=53) PERFORMED SITTING ACTIVITY AND SURYANAMASKAR FOR 4-WEEKS EACH. EPWORTH SLEEPINESS SCALE (ESS) WAS USED TO MEASURE EDS AT 0, 4, AND 8 WEEKS. RESULTS: SKY GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT ESS SCORE IMPROVEMENTS BETWEEN 0-4 WEEKS AND 4-8 WEEKS OF 1.22 (P=0.0001) AND 1.66 (P=0.001) RESPECTIVELY. CONTROLS HOWEVER FAILED TO IMPROVE WITH SCORE DIFFERENCES OF 0.02 (P=0.892) AND 0.02 (P=0.8212) RESPECTIVELY. SKY GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT ESS SCORE IMPROVEMENT OVER CONTROLS AT 4-WEEKS (DIFFERENCE=1.74; P=0.013) AND 8-WEEKS (DIFFERENCE EIGHT; P=0.0001). IMPROVEMENT WAS MOST FOR OBESE PEOPLE AND THOSE SITTING IN A HALTED CAR. CONCLUSIONS: IMPROVEMENT IN SUBJECTS' NIGHTTIME SLEEP AND DAYTIME WAKEFULNESS IN SKY PRACTITIONERS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO POLYVAGAL THEORY. INCREASED HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) ALTERATIONS AND SYMPATHETIC HYPERAROUSAL IN CHRONIC INSOMNIA; AND CHOLINERGIC AND GABAERGIC DYSREGULATION IN ANXIETY DISORDERS ARE COUNTERED BY REGULATED VAGAL NERVE STIMULATION POST SKY. OUR STUDY ESTABLISHES EFFECTIVITY OF SKY IN REDUCING EDS (TOTAL AND SITUATIONAL), PROVIDES A CLINICAL CORRELATION FOR PRIOR POLYSOMNOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE AND PAVES WAY FOR LARGER TRIALS DIRECTED TOWARDS SKY PRESCRIPTIONS FOR INSOMNIA.	2020	
                                                   
2 2010  36 SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA IMPROVES CARDIAC AUTONOMIC CONTROL IN PATIENTS WITH ANXIETY-DEPRESSION DISORDERS. BACKGROUND: SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT ADJUVANT THERAPIES AS EXERCISE AND BREATHING TRAINING ARE EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING CARDIAC AUTONOMIC CONTROL (CAC) IN PATIENTS WITH AFFECTIVE SPECTRUM DISORDERS. HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS OF SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA (SKY) ON AUTONOMIC FUNCTION IN THIS POPULATION IS UNKNOWN. OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT SKY TRAINING IMPROVES CAC AND CARDIORESPIRATORY COUPLING IN PATIENTS WITH ANXIETY AND/OR DEPRESSION DISORDERS. METHODS: FORTY-SIX PATIENTS WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF ANXIETY AND/OR DEPRESSION DISORDERS (DSM-IV) WERE CONSECUTIVELY ENROLLED AND DIVIDED IN TWO GROUPS: 1) CONVENTIONAL THERAPY (CONTROL) AND 2) CONVENTIONAL THERAPY ASSOCIATED WITH SKY (TREATMENT) FOR 15 DAYS. ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION LEVELS WERE DETERMINED USING QUANTITATIVE QUESTIONNAIRES. FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF CAC AND CARDIORESPIRATORY COUPLING, CARDIORESPIRATORY TRACES WERE ANALYZED USING MONOVARIATE AND BIVARIATE AUTOREGRESSIVE SPECTRAL ANALYSIS, RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS: AFTER 15-DAYS, WE OBSERVED A REDUCTION OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION LEVELS ONLY IN TREATMENT GROUP. MOREOVER, SYMPATHETIC MODULATION AND CAC WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER WHILE PARASYMPATHETIC MODULATION AND CARDIORESPIRATORY COUPLING WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN THE TREATMENT COMPARED TO CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: INTENSIVE BREATHING TRAINING USING SKY APPROACH IMPROVES ANXIETY AND/OR DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS AS WELL AS CAC AND CARDIORESPIRATORY COUPLING. THESE FINDING SUGGEST THAT THE SKY TRAINING MAY BE A USEFUL NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE SYMPTOMS AND REDUCE CARDIOVASCULAR RISK IN PATIENTS WITH ANXIETY/DEPRESSION DISORDERS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                      
3 1027  36 EFFECTS OF YOGA BREATHING PRACTICE ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY IN HEALTHY ADOLESCENTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AMONG HEALTHY ADOLESCENTS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA BREATHING PRACTICE (BHRAMARI PRANAYAMA, BHR.P) TOWARDS CARDIAC AUTONOMIC FUNCTION USING HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) PARAMETERS. METHODS: OF THE 730 ELIGIBLE SUBJECTS SCREENED, 520 HEALTHY ADOLESCENTS WHO MET THE INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER YOGA BREATHING GROUP (N=260) OR CONTROL GROUP (N=260). THE YOGA BREATHING GROUP PRACTICED BHR.P. FIVE DAYS A WEEK FOR A DURATION OF SIX MONTHS WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP CONTINUED WITH THEIR DAILY ROUTINE WITHOUT ANY INTERVENTION. OUTCOME MEASURES WERE TIME AND FREQUENCY DOMAIN OF HRV IN BOTH GROUPS WHICH WERE ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION USING LEAD II ECG. LINEAR MODELS WERE USED IN THE ANALYSIS OF SHORT TERM HRV. RESULTS: AFTER 6 MONTHS OF YOGA BREATHING, THE TIME DOMAIN PARAMETERS OF SHORT TERM HRV SHOWED SIGNIFICANT (P<0.05) IMPROVEMENT TOWARDS THE PARASYMPATHETIC DOMAIN. FREQUENCY DOMAIN PARAMETERS ALSO SHOWED THE SAME DIRECTION OF CHANGES. IN CONTRAST, CONTROL GROUP SUBJECTS SHOWED A TREND TOWARDS A SYMPATHETIC DOMAIN. CONCLUSION: THE PRESENT STUDY SHOWED A POSITIVE SHIFT IN CARDIAC AUTONOMIC MODULATION TOWARDS PARASYMPATHETIC PREDOMINANCE AFTER 6 MONTHS OF YOGA BREATHING PRACTICE AMONG APPARENTLY HEALTHY ADOLESCENTS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
4  325  41 ANTI-ANXIETY EFFICACY OF SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA IN GENERAL ANXIETY DISORDER: A MULTICOMPONENT, YOGA BASED, BREATH INTERVENTION PROGRAM FOR PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER WITH OR WITHOUT COMORBIDITIES. BACKGROUND: SURDASHAN KRIYA YOGA (SKY) IS A PROCEDURE THAT IN VARIOUS STUDIES, HAS SHOWN EVIDENCES OF EFFICACY IN ALLEVIATING DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY DISORDERS, BUT IN EUROPE AND USA IT HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED YET ON A CAUCASIAN POPULATION AS AN ADJUNCT THERAPY FOR PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS. METHODS: THE STUDY INVOLVED A SAMPLE OF CONSENTING WOMEN AND MEN (N = 69) WHO RECEIVED SKY THERAPY FOR A SIX-MONTH TIME PERIOD. THEY WERE ASSESSED AT RECRUITMENT, AFTER TWO WEEKS, AFTER THREE MONTHS AND AFTER SIX MONTHS USING HAMILTON RATING SCALE FOR ANXIETY (HRSA), HAMILTON RATING SCALE FOR DEPRESSION (HRSD), ZUNG SELF-RATING ANXIETY SCALE (ZSAS), ZUNG SELF-RATING DEPRESSION SCALE (ZSDS) AND SYMPTOM CHECKLIST-90 (SCL-90). RESULTS: ALL THE ANALYSES HAVE SHOWN THAT SKY THERAPY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES THE SCORES OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. THIS IS PLAIN, ESPECIALLY AFTER THE INITIAL SKY TREATMENT, WHICH IS FOLLOWED BY A LONG PLATEAU PHASE THAT SEEMS TO VERGE ON NO ANXIETY/DEPRESSION SCORES. IT WAS FOUND THAT SKY EFFECTS LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT CONVERGENCE BETWEEN THE SELF-ASSESSMENT (ZUNG SELF-RATING SCALE) AND HETERO-ASSESSMENT (HAMILTON RATING SCALE). LIMITATIONS: THE STUDY SHOULD BE REPLICATED ON A LARGER CLINICAL SAMPLE IN A CONTROLLED TRIAL TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SKY PROTOCOL. CONCLUSIONS: PARTICIPATION IN SKY ADJUNCT THERAPY TEN DAYS INTENSE WORKSHOP AND FOLLOW-UPS, COUPLED WITH DAILY INDIVIDUAL AND INDEPENDENT PRACTICE OF A SIMPLIFIED PROTOCOL OF BREATHING TECHNIQUES (30 MIN), CAN LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN LEVELS OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION.	2015	
                                                                                                                
5 1605  33 MENTAL STRESS: NEUROPHYSIOLOGY AND ITS REGULATION BY SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA. AIM: THE PRESENT STUDY FOCUSES ON ANALYZING THE EFFECTS OF SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA (SKY) ON EEG AS WELL AS ECG SIGNALS FOR STRESS REGULATION. TO ENVISION THE REGULATION OF STRESS DETERMINATION TEST (DT) HAS BEEN USED. WE HAVE CHOSEN A CONTROL GROUP FOR CONTRIVING A COGENT COMPARISON THAT COULD BE CORROBORATED USING STATISTICAL TESTS. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 20 SUBJECTS WERE TAKEN IN THE STUDY, OF WHICH 10 WERE ALLOTTED TO A CONTROL GROUP. ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPH WAS TAKEN DURING A DT TASK, BEFORE AND AFTER SKY THE SKY SESSION WITH 30 DAYS OF SKY SESSION GIVEN TO THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP. NO SKY WAS GIVEN TO THE CONTROL GROUP. RESULTS: WE QUANTIFIED MENTAL STRESS USING EEG, ECG AND DT SYNERGISTICALLY AND USED SKY TO REGULATE IT. WE OBSERVED THAT ALPHA BAND POWER DECREASES IN THE FRONTAL LOBE OF THE BRAIN WITH INCREASING MENTAL STRESS WHILE FRONTAL BRAIN ASYMMETRY DECREASES WITH INCREASING STRESS TOLERANCE. CONCLUSIONS: THESE EEG, ECG AND DT SHOWS A SIGNIFICANT DECREMENT IN MENTAL STRESS AND IMPROVEMENT IN COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE AFTER SKY, INDICATING SKY AS A GOOD ALTERNATIVE OF MEDICATION FOR STRESS MANAGEMENT.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
6 1542  33 KRIYA YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES DESPITE THE EASY ACCEPTABILITY AND HOLISTIC NATURE OF KRIYA YOGA, THERE ARE NO STUDIES EVALUATING THE ROLE OF KRIYA YOGA INTERVENTION ON DEPRESSION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE CURRENT STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFECT OF ADJUNCTIVE KRIYA YOGA ON DEPRESSION. METHODS PATIENTS WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER WHO OPTED FOR KRIYA YOGA WERE RECRUITED INTO THE INTERVENTION GROUP (ADJUNCTIVE KRIYA YOGA) AND THOSE ON PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION ALONE WERE ENROLLED INTO THE CONTROL GROUP. THE HAMILTON DEPRESSION RATING SCALE (HDRS) MEASUREMENTS WERE RECORDED AT BASELINE, END OF 2, 4, AND 8 WEEKS. RESULTS HDRS SCORES OF THE INTERVENTION GROUP ( N = 29) WERE FOUND TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY LESSER THAN THAT OF THE CONTROL GROUP ( N = 52) BY THE END OF 2, 4, AND 8 WEEKS. THE REMISSION RATE WAS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP. CONCLUSION KRIYA YOGA INTERVENTION WAS FOUND TO BE FEASIBLE, AS WELL AS IMPROVED THE SEVERITY OF DEPRESSION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
7 2521  36 YOGA DECREASES INSOMNIA IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN: A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: THE PRACTICE OF YOGA HAS BEEN PROVEN TO HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON REDUCING INSOMNIA. STUDIES HAVE ALSO SHOWN ITS EFFECTS ON REDUCING CLIMACTERIC SYMPTOMS. TO DATE, HOWEVER, NO STUDIES THAT EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF INSOMNIA IN A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICE ON THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH AND CLIMACTERIC SYMPTOMS OF POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF INSOMNIA. METHODS: POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN NOT UNDERGOING HORMONE THERAPY, WHO WERE 50 TO 65 YEARS OLD, WHO HAD AN APNEA-HYPOPNEA INDEX LESS THAN 15, AND WHO HAD A DIAGNOSIS OF INSOMNIA WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THREE GROUPS, AS FOLLOWS: CONTROL, PASSIVE STRETCHING, AND YOGA. QUESTIONNAIRES WERE ADMINISTERED BEFORE AND 4 MONTHS AFTER THE INTERVENTION TO EVALUATE QUALITY OF LIFE, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS, CLIMACTERIC SYMPTOMS, INSOMNIA SEVERITY, DAYTIME SLEEPINESS, AND STRESS. THE VOLUNTEERS ALSO UNDERWENT POLYSOMNOGRAPHY. THE STUDY LASTED 4 MONTHS. RESULTS: THERE WERE 44 VOLUNTEERS AT THE END OF THE STUDY. WHEN COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP, THE YOGA GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER POSTTREATMENT SCORES FOR CLIMACTERIC SYMPTOMS AND INSOMNIA SEVERITY AND HIGHER SCORES FOR QUALITY OF LIFE AND RESISTANCE PHASE OF STRESS. THE REDUCTION IN INSOMNIA SEVERITY IN THE YOGA GROUP WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT IN THE CONTROL AND PASSIVE-STRETCHING GROUPS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT A SPECIFIC SEQUENCE OF YOGA MIGHT BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING INSOMNIA AND MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS AS WELL AS IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WITH INSOMNIA.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                  
8  748  28 EFFECT OF SAHAJA YOGA MEDITATION ON QUALITY OF LIFE, ANXIETY, AND BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL. OBJECTIVE: THE PRESENT STUDY INVESTIGATES THE EFFECT OF SAHAJA YOGA MEDITATION ON QUALITY OF LIFE, ANXIETY, AND BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL. DESIGN: THE PROSPECTIVE OBSERVATIONAL COHORT STUDY ENROLLED TWO STUDY GROUPS: THOSE RECEIVING TREATMENT FROM THE INTERNATIONAL SAHAJA YOGA RESEARCH AND HEALTH CENTER (MEDITATION GROUP) AND THOSE RECEIVING TREATMENT FROM THE MAHATMA GANDHI MISSION HOSPITAL (CONTROL GROUP). RESEARCHERS MEASURED QUALITY OF LIFE, ANXIETY, AND BLOOD PRESSURE BEFORE AND AFTER TREATMENT. RESULTS: SIXTY-SEVEN (67) PARTICIPANTS IN THE MEDITATION GROUP AND 62 PARTICIPANTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP COMPLETED THE STUDY. THE TWO GROUPS WERE COMPARABLE IN DEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS. AT BASELINE, THE MEDITATION GROUP HAD HIGHER QUALITY OF LIFE (P<0.001) THAN CONTROLS BUT SIMILAR ANXIETY LEVEL (P=0.74) TO CONTROLS. WITHIN-GROUP PRE- VERSUS POST-TREATMENT COMPARISONS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN QUALITY OF LIFE, ANXIETY, AND BLOOD PRESSURE IN THE MEDITATION GROUP (P<0.001), WHILE IN CONTROLS, QUALITY OF LIFE DETERIORATED AND THERE WAS NO IMPROVEMENT IN BLOOD PRESSURE. THE IMPROVEMENT IN QUALITY OF LIFE, ANXIETY REDUCTION, AND BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL WAS GREATER IN THE MEDITATION GROUP. THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF MEDITATION REMAINED SIGNIFICANT AFTER ADJUSTING FOR CONFOUNDERS. CONCLUSIONS: MEDITATION TREATMENT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN QUALITY OF LIFE, ANXIETY REDUCTION, AND BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
9  762  33 EFFECT OF SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA ON ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PEOPLE WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES: A PILOT STUDY IN KUWAIT. AIM: THIS PILOT STUDY IN KUWAIT WAS AIMED TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA (SKY) ON ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND TOTAL QUALITY OF LIFE IN PEOPLE WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM). METHODS: 26 T2DM PATIENTS AGED GREATER THAN 30, MALE AND FEMALE VISITING THE OUTPATIENT CLINIC OF DASMAN DIABETES INSTITUTE WERE ENROLLED FOR THE STUDY. PRE AND POST 5 DAY SKY INTERVENTION RESPONSES OF PARTICIPANTS ON PSYCHOSOCIAL PROBLEMS WERE EVALUATED USING FOUR QUESTIONNAIRES (HAMILTON ANXIETY, PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE (PHQ-9), HOSPITAL ANXIETY DEPRESSION AND WHO TOTAL QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS; SUCH AS LIPID PROFILE, GLYCATED HEMOGLOBIN (HBA1C) WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE AND AFTER 15 WEEKS OF SKY PRACTICE. RESULTS: THE MEAN AGE OF THE PARTICIPANTS WAS 56.7 (+/-11.4 SD) YEARS, AND MEAN DURATION OF DIABETES 15.0 (+/-9.3 SD) YEARS. COMPARISON OF RESPONSES BEFORE AND AFTER INTERVENTION INDICATED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE QOL, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY AND INSOMNIA. BUT NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN GLYCEMIC CONTROL. CONCLUSION: RESULTS INDICATE THAT SKY CAN BE POTENTIALLY BENEFICIAL FOR TREATING ANXIETY, INSOMNIA, AND DEPRESSION ASSOCIATED IN PEOPLE WITH T2DM AND IN IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN PEOPLE WITH T2DM.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
10  771  44 EFFECT OF YOGA AND AEROBICS EXERCISE ON SLEEP QUALITY IN WOMEN WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS INVESTIGATING THE EFFECT OF 12 WEEKS OF YOGA AND AEROBIC EXERCISE (RUNNING ON A TREADMILL) ON THE SLEEP QUALITY IN WOMEN WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 39 DIABETIC WOMEN WERE SELECTED FROM SEMNAN CITY WITH THE MEAN AGE OF 46.85+/-3.35 YEARS, WEIGHT OF 69.79+/-17.18 KG, HEIGHT OF 155.03+/-5.00, BMI OF 29.64+/-5.00 KG/M(2) WHO HAD A BACKGROUND OF DIABETES FOR 6.46+/-2.69 YEARS. THEY WERE THEN RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO YOGA EXERCISE (N=15), AEROBIC EXERCISE (N=13), AND CONTROL GROUP (N=11). THE EXERCISE PROGRAM WAS PERFORMED FOR 12 WEEKS, THREE SESSIONS PER EACH WEEK. IN ORDER TO MEASURE THE SLEEP QUALITY, THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI) WAS USED. THE DATA WERE ANALYZED BY NON-PARAMETRIC WILCOXON AND KRUSKAL-WALLIS TEST AT SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL OF P<0.05. RESULTS: OVERALL SCORE OF SLEEP QUALITY IMPROVED AFTER SIX (P=0.001) AND 12 (P=0.001) WEEKS OF YOGA EXERCISE. ALSO, SIGNIFICANT EFFECT WAS OBSERVED AFTER 6 WEEKS OF AEROBIC EXERCISE (P=0.039). HOWEVER, THE POSITIVE EFFECT WAS DIMINISHED TO UNDER SIGNIFICANT LEVELS AFTER 12 WEEKS OF AEROBIC EXERCISE (P=0.154). KRUSKAL-WALLIS TEST SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN YOGA AND AEROBIC GROUPS AFTER 12 WEEKS OF EXERCISE (P=0.002). NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED IN CONTROL GROUPS IN ALL SITUATION. CONCLUSIONS: IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT YOGA EXERCISE IS MORE EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING THE SLEEP QUALITY IN COMPARISON WITH THE SAME COURSE OF AEROBIC EXERCISE IN WOMEN SUFFERING FROM DIABETES TYPE 2. THUS, YOGA EXERCISE CAN BE SUGGESTED TO THESE PATIENTS.	2017

BACKGROUND: STRESS IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED OCCURRENCE OF AUTONOMIC, CARDIOVASCULAR, AND IMMUNE SYSTEM PATHOLOGY. THIS STUDY WAS DONE TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF STRESS ON PSYCHOLOGICAL, PHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS, AND IMMUNE SYSTEM DURING MEDICAL TERM -ACADEMIC EXAMINATION AND THE EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICES ON THE SAME. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT ON SIXTY FIRST-YEAR MBBS STUDENTS RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO YOGA GROUP AND CONTROL GROUP (30 EACH). THE YOGA GROUP UNDERWENT INTEGRATED YOGA PRACTICES FOR 35 MINUTES DAILY IN THE PRESENCE OF TRAINED YOGA TEACHER FOR 12 WEEKS. CONTROL GROUP DID NOT UNDERGO ANY KIND OF YOGA PRACTICE OR STRESS MANAGEMENT. PHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS LIKE HEART RATE, RESPIRATORY RATE, AND BLOOD PRESSURE WERE MEASURED. GLOBAL ASSESSMENT OF RECENT STRESS SCALE AND SPIELBERGERS STATE ANXIETY SCORE WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND DURING THE EXAMINATION. SERUM CORTISOL LEVELS, IL-4, AND IFN-GAMMA LEVELS WERE DETERMINED BY ENZYME-LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAY TECHNIQUE. RESULT: IN THE YOGA GROUP, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED IN PHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS DURING THE EXAMINATION STRESS, WHEREAS IN THE CONTROL GROUP, A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE WAS OBSERVED. LIKEWISE, THE INDICATORS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS SHOWED HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN CONTROL GROUP COMPARED WITH SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN YOGA GROUP. DURING THE EXAMINATION, THE INCREASE IN SERUM CORTICAL AND DECREASE IN SERUM IFN-GAMMA IN YOGA GROUP WAS LESS SIGNIFICANT (P<0.01) THAN IN THE CONTROL GROUP (P<0.001). BOTH THE GROUPS DEMONSTRATED AN INCREASE IN SERUM IL-4 LEVELS, THE CHANGES BEING INSIGNIFICANT FOR THE DURATION OF THE STUDY. CONCLUSION: YOGA RESISTS THE AUTONOMIC CHANGES AND IMPAIRMENT OF CELLULAR IMMUNITY SEEN IN EXAMINATION STRESS.	2011	
                                
12 1380  28 IMPACT OF LONG TERM YOGA PRACTICE ON SLEEP QUALITY AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE ELDERLY. BACKGROUND: SLEEP DISTURBANCES AND DECLINE IN THE PHYSICAL FUNCTIONALITY ARE COMMON CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH AGING. PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF SLEEP DISTURBANCES CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS ADVERSE EFFECTS. SHORT TERM TRIALS OF YOGA ON SLEEP HAVE SHOWN BENEFICIAL EFFECTS. OBJECTIVES: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF LONG-TERM YOGA EXERCISES ON SLEEP QUALITY AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) IN THE ELDERLY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS WAS A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY IN WHICH DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM ELDERLY PEOPLE AGED 60 YEARS OR MORE LIVING IN NAGPUR CITY. WE EMPLOYED TWO TYPES OF SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRES: PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI) AND QOL LEIDEN-PADUA (LEIPAD) QUESTIONNAIRE. A TOTAL OF 65 ELDERLY MEN AND WOMEN WHO SIGNED AN INFORMED CONSENT AND COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. SLEEP QUALITY SCORE PSQI AND QOL (LEIPAD QUESTIONNAIRE) SCORE OF THE STUDY GROUP WERE EVALUATED AND COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP USING MANN-WHITNEY U TEST. RESULTS: TOTAL PSQI SCORE IN YOGA GROUP WAS LOWER THAN THAT OF THE CONTROL GROUP. ALSO VARIOUS QOL SCORES OF THE YOGA GROUPS WERE HIGHER THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: ADDITION OF REGULAR YOGA EXERCISES IN THE DAILY ROUTINE OF ELDERLY PEOPLE CAN HELP TO ACHIEVE GOOD SLEEP QUALITY AS WELL AS IMPROVE THE QOL.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
13 2103  30 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY LEVEL IN SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS. PURPOSE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY LEVEL IN SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN WITH PRETEST-POSTTEST CONTROL GROUP. THE POPULATION OF THE STUDY CONSISTED OF SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS WITH REGISTERED IN MALATYA AND ELAZIG COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH CENTERS AND REGULARLY GOING TO THESE CENTERS. THE SAMPLE GROUP OF THE STUDY CONSISTED OF TOTALLY 100 PATIENTS INCLUDING 50 PATIENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND 50 PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP WHO WERE SPECIFIED THROUGH POWER ANALYSIS AND CHOSEN BY USING RANDOM SAMPLING METHOD FROM THIS POPULATION. THE DATA WERE COLLECTED BETWEEN APRIL 2015 AND AUGUST 2015. 'PATIENT DESCRIPTION FORM' AND 'FROGS' WERE USED TO COLLECT THE DATA. YOGA WAS APPLIED TO PATIENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP. ANY INTERVENTION WAS NOT MADE TO PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP. PERCENTAGE DISTRIBUTION, ARITHMETIC MEAN, STANDARD DEVIATION, CHI-SQUARE, INDEPENDENT SAMPLES T TEST, AND PAIRED T TEST WERE USED TO ASSESS THE DATA. RESULTS: PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL AND EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PRETEST SUBSCALE AND THE TOTAL MEANS SCORES OF FROGS WAS FOUND TO BE LOW. IN THE POSTTEST SUBSCALE AND TOTAL MEANS SCORES OF FROGS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WERE HIGHER THAN IN THE CONTROL GROUP AND THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THEM WERE FOUND TO BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P<0.05). IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PRETEST AND POSTTEST SUBSCALE AND TOTAL MEANS SCORES OF FR0GS WAS DETERMINED TO BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: YOGA THAT APPLIED TO SCHIZOPHRENIC PATIENTS IT WAS DETERMINED TO INCREASED THE LEVEL OF FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY. IT CAN BE SUGGESTED THAT YOGA SHOULD BE USED AS AN COMPLEMENTARY METHOD IN NURSING PRACTISE IN ORDER TO INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE TREATMENT.	2016	
       
14 2319  29 TREATING THE CLIMACTERIC SYMPTOMS IN INDIAN WOMEN WITH AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO YOGA THERAPY: A RANDOMIZED CONTROL STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE CLIMACTERIC SYMPTOMS, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND PERSONALITY IN PERIMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. DESIGN: ONE HUNDRED TWENTY PARTICIPANTS (AGES 40-55 Y) WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO STUDY ARMS, IE, YOGA AND CONTROL. THE YOGA GROUP PRACTICED AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO YOGA THERAPY COMPRISING SURYA NAMASKARA (SUN SALUTATION) WITH 12 POSTURES, PRANAYAMA (BREATHING PRACTICES), AND AVARTAN DHYAN (CYCLIC MEDITATION), WHEREAS THE CONTROL GROUP PRACTICED A SET OF SIMPLE PHYSICAL EXERCISES UNDER SUPERVISION OF TRAINED TEACHERS FOR 8 WEEKS (1 H DAILY, 5 DAYS PER WEEK). THE ASSESSMENTS WERE MADE BY GREENE CLIMACTERIC SCALE, PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE, AND EYSENCK'S PERSONALITY INVENTORY BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION. RESULTS: OF THE THREE FACTORS OF THE GREENE CLIMACTERIC SCALE, THE MANN-WHITNEY TEST SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS (P < 0.05) IN THE VASOMOTOR SYMPTOMS, A MARGINALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE (P = 0.06) IN PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS BUT NOT IN THE SOMATIC COMPONENT. EFFECT SIZES WERE HIGHER IN THE YOGA GROUP FOR ALL FACTORS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER DEGREE OF DECREASE IN PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE SCORES (P < 0.001, INDEPENDENT SAMPLES T TEST) IN THE YOGA GROUP COMPARED WITH CONTROLS (BETWEEN-GROUP ANALYSIS) WITH A HIGHER EFFECT SIZE IN THE YOGA GROUP (1.10) THAN THE CONTROL (0.27). ON THE EYSENCK'S PERSONALITY INVENTORY, THE DECREASE IN NEUROTICISM WAS GREATER (P < 0.05) IN THE YOGA GROUP (EFFECT SIZE = 0.43) THAN THE CONTROL GROUP (EFFECT SIZE = 0.21) WITH NO CHANGE IN EXTROVERSION IN EITHER THE YOGA OR CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: EIGHT WEEKS OF AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO YOGA THERAPY DECREASES CLIMACTERIC SYMPTOMS, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND NEUROTICISM IN PERIMENOPAUSAL WOMEN BETTER THAN PHYSICAL EXERCISE.	2008	

15 1637  19 MODULATION OF CARDIAC AUTONOMIC BALANCE WITH ADJUVANT YOGA THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH REFRACTORY EPILEPSY. THE PRACTICE OF YOGA REGULATES BODY PHYSIOLOGY THROUGH CONTROL OF POSTURE, BREATHING, AND MEDITATION. EFFECTS OF YOGA ON AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS OF PATIENTS WITH REFRACTORY EPILEPSY, AS QUANTIFIED BY STANDARDIZED AUTONOMIC FUNCTION TESTS (AFTS), WERE DETERMINED. THE YOGA GROUP (N=18) RECEIVED SUPERVISED TRAINING IN YOGA, AND THE EXERCISE GROUP (N=16) PRACTICED SIMPLE ROUTINE EXERCISES. AFTS WERE REPEATED AFTER 10 WEEKS OF DAILY SESSIONS. DATA WERE COMPARED WITH THOSE OF HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS (N=142). THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PARASYMPATHETIC PARAMETERS AND A DECREASE IN SEIZURE FREQUENCY SCORES. THERE WAS NO IMPROVEMENT IN BLOOD PRESSURE PARAMETERS IN EITHER GROUP. TWO PATIENTS IN THE YOGA GROUP ACHIEVED NORMAL AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS AT THE END OF 10 WEEKS OF THERAPY, WHEREAS THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN THE EXERCISE GROUP. THE DATA SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY HAVE A ROLE AS AN ADJUVANT THERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION IN PATIENTS WITH REFRACTORY EPILEPSY.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
16  760  34 EFFECT OF SUDARSANKRIYA YOGA PRACTICES ON P300 AMPLITUDE AND LATENCY. THE COGNITIVE ABILITY WHICH WAS PERCEIVED AS A CONSTANT TRAIT, IS NOW UNDERSTOOD TO BE UPGRADED BY ADAPTIVE AND EXTENDED TRAINING. YOGA PRACTICES ARE KNOWN TO SHARPEN THE INTELLECT AND ENHANCE CONCENTRATION. IN THE INITIAL PERIOD OF PRACTICING YOGA AS AN ALTERNATIVE/SUPPORTING TOOL TO MEDICAL LINE OF TREATMENT, IT IS ESSENTIAL TO INVESTIGATE EFFECT OF YOGA ON COGNITIVE ABILITY USING OBJECTIVE METHOD, IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH EVIDENCES. HENCE, AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE THE EFFECT OF REGULAR PRACTICE OF SUDARSANKRIYA YOGA ON AUDITORY EVENT RELATED POTENTIAL (P300) BY RECORDING AND COMPARING PEAK LATENCY AND AMPLITUDE. THE PARTICIPANTS WERE DIVIDED INTO THREE GROUPS WITH GROUP I AND GROUP II PARTICIPANTS PRACTICING SUDARSANKRIYA YOGA FOR MORE THAN 36 MONTHS AND LESS THAN 36 MONTHS RESPECTIVELY. GROUP III WERE NON-PRACTITIONERS WITH NO PRIOR PRACTICE OF ANY FORM OF YOGA. TWENTY PARTICIPANTS IN EACH GROUP WITH A TOTAL OF 60 PARTICIPANTS BETWEEN 40 TO 65 YEARS OF AGE WERE RECRUITED FOR THE STUDY. RESULTS REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE FOR MEAN LATENCY AND AMPLITUDE BETWEEN THREE GROUPS. FINDINGS OF THE CURRENT STUDY SUGGEST THAT SUDARSANKRIYA YOGA PRACTICES SLOWS DOWN THE PROCESS OF AGING EFFECT OR MAINTAINS ON COGNITIVE ABILITY IN ADULTS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
17 2112  32 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON STRESS, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION IN WOMEN. BACKGROUND: IN RECENT DECADES, SEVERAL MEDICAL AND SCIENTIFIC STUDIES ON YOGA PROVED IT TO BE VERY USEFUL IN THE TREATMENT OF SOME DISEASES. THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION IN WOMEN LIVING IN ILAM, IRAN. METHODS: THIS STUDY IS A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WITH PRE-POST TEST. TO COLLECT DATA, THE QUESTIONNAIRE OF DASS-21 (DEPRESSION ANXIETY STRESS SCALE-21) WAS USED. FOR ELIGIBLE SAMPLES, HATHA YOGA EXERCISES AND TRAINING SESSIONS WERE HELD FOR 4 WEEKS (3 TIME/WEEKS; 60-70 MIN EACH) BY A SPECIALIST. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING SPSS VERSION 20. RESULTS: 52 WOMEN WITH A MEAN AGE OF 33.5 +/- 6.5 WERE INCLUDED FOR ANALYSIS. DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND STRESS DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN WOMEN AFTER 12 SESSIONS OF REGULAR HATHA YOGA PRACTICE (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: YOGA HAS AN EFFECTIVE ROLE IN REDUCING STRESS, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION. THUS, IT CAN BE USED AS COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
18 1457  35 INFLUENCE OF YOGA AND AYURVEDA ON SELF-RATED SLEEP IN A GERIATRIC POPULATION. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: SLEEP IN OLDER PERSONS IS CHARACTERIZED BY DECREASED ABILITY TO STAY ASLEEP, RESULTING IN FRAGMENTED SLEEP AND REDUCED DAYTIME ALERTNESS. PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF INSOMNIA IN OLDER PERSONS IS ASSOCIATED WITH HAZARDOUS SIDE EFFECTS. HENCE, THE PRESENT STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND AYURVEDA ON THE SELF RATED SLEEP IN A GERIATRIC POPULATION. METHODS: OF THE 120 RESIDENTS FROM A HOME FOR THE AGED, 69 WERE STRATIFIED BASED ON AGE (FIVE YEAR INTERVALS) AND RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO THREE GROUPS I.E., YOGA (PHYSICAL POSTURES, RELAXATION TECHNIQUES, VOLUNTARILY REGULATED BREATHING AND LECTURES ON YOGA PHILOSOPHY), AYURVEDA (A HERBAL PREPARATION), AND WAIT-LIST CONTROL (NO INTERVENTION). THE GROUPS WERE EVALUATED FOR SELF-ASSESSMENT OF SLEEP OVER A ONE WEEK PERIOD AT BASELINE, AND AFTER THREE AND SIX MONTHS OF THE RESPECTIVE INTERVENTIONS. RESULTS: THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE TIME TAKEN TO FALL ASLEEP (APPROXIMATE GROUP AVERAGE DECREASE: 10 MIN, P<0.05), AN INCREASE IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS SLEPT (APPROXIMATE GROUP AVERAGE INCREASE: 60 MIN, P< 0.05) AND IN THE FEELING OF BEING RESTED IN THE MORNING BASED ON A RATING SCALE (P<0.05) AFTER SIX MONTHS. THE OTHER GROUPS SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION: YOGA PRACTICE IMPROVED DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF SLEEP IN A GERIATRIC POPULATION.	2005	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
19 1003  31 EFFECTS OF MATERNITY YOGA ON THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM DURING PREGNANCY. AIM: TO ELUCIDATE THE CHANGES IN THE DAILY VARIATION SEEN IN THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM DURING PREGNANCY BROUGHT ABOUT BY MATERNITY YOGA AND TO EVALUATE HOW MATERNAL YOGA AFFECTS STRESS AND SLEEP. METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE, LONGITUDINAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED BETWEEN JANUARY 2013 AND DECEMBER 2014. PREGNANT WOMEN WHO WERE ATTENDING MATERNITY YOGA CLASSES AT PALMORE HOSPITAL BETWEEN 20 AND 23 WEEKS' GESTATION WERE ENROLLED AS THE YOGA GROUP, AND A MATCHED CONTROL GROUP WAS ALSO ENROLLED. STUDY PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES, INCLUDING A PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE AND SLEEP LOGS, DURING THEIR SECOND AND THIRD TRIMESTERS. HEART RATE VARIABILITY AND SALIVARY ALPHA-AMYLASE LEVELS WERE EVALUATED AS STRESS INDICES AT 20-23 WEEKS' GESTATION, 28-31 WEEKS' GESTATION AND 36-40 WEEKS' GESTATION. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 38 WOMEN WERE IN THE YOGA GROUP, WITH 53 IN THE CONTROL GROUP. AT 28-31 WEEKS' GESTATION, HEART RATE VARIABILITY DURING NIGHT AND LATE-NIGHT PERIODS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN THE YOGA GROUP THAN IN THE CONTROL GROUP. AT 36-40 WEEKS' GESTATION, VARIABILITY BETWEEN THE MORNING, AFTERNOON AND LATE NIGHT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN THE YOGA GROUP. SALIVARY ALPHA-AMYLASE LEVELS DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IMMEDIATELY AFTER PRACTICING YOGA DURING ALL EVALUATION PERIODS IN THE YOGA GROUP. NIGHT-TIME SLEEP DURATION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER IN THE YOGA GROUP. CONCLUSION: OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT PRACTICING YOGA ACTIVATES THE PARASYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM DURING THE THIRD TRIMESTER OF PREGNANCY, CONSOLIDATING SLEEP DURING THE NIGHT AND DECREASING ALPHA-AMYLASE LEVELS, WHICH INDICATES REDUCED STRESS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
20  819  29 EFFECT OF YOGA ON DEPRESSION IN HYPOTHYROIDISM: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: THE PREVALENCE OF HYPOTHYROIDISM AMONG INDIAN WOMEN IS 15.8%. DEPRESSION IS FREQUENTLY REPORTED IN HYPOTHYROIDISM. YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR DEPRESSION. HOWEVER, THE INFLUENCE OF YOGA ON DEPRESSION IN PATIENTS WITH HYPOTHYROIDISM HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED. AIM: THE PRESENT STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECT OF A 3-MONTH INTEGRATED YOGA INTERVENTION (3-IY) ON DEPRESSION, LIPID INDICES, AND SERUM THYROID-STIMULATING HORMONE (STSH) LEVELS AMONG FEMALE PATIENTS HAVING HYPOTHYROIDISM, AND MILD-TO-MODERATE DEPRESSION. METHOD: THE PRESENT SINGLE-ARM PRE-POST DESIGN STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN THIRTY-EIGHT WOMEN (AVERAGE AGE 34.2 +/- 4.7 YEARS). PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED A 3-IY COMPRISING ASANAS, PRANAYAMA, AND RELAXATION TECHNIQUES FOR 60 MIN DAILY (5 DAYS A WEEK). DEPRESSION, STSH, LIPID PROFILE INDICES, BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), FATIGUE, ANXIETY, AND STRESS WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND AFTER 12 WEEKS. THYROID MEDICATION WAS KEPT CONSTANT DURING THE STUDY PERIOD. DATA WERE ANALYSED USING R STUDIO SOFTWARE. RESULT: A SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.05) REDUCTION IN DEPRESSION (58%), STSH (37%), BMI (6%), FATIGUE (64%), ANXIETY (57%), LIPID PROFILE INDICES (HLD INCREASED SIGNIFICANTY), AND STRESS (55%) LEVELS WAS OBSERVED AFTER 3 MONTHS, COMPARED WITH THE CORRESPONDING BASELINE LEVELS. CONCLUSION: THE 3-IY IS USEFUL FOR REDUCING DEPRESSION, DYSLIPIDEMIA, AND STSH IN WOMEN WITH HYPOTHYROIDISM AND DEPRESSION. FURTHER STUDIES WITH A LARGER SAMPLE SIZE AND A ROBUST RESEARCH DESIGN USING OBJECTIVE VARIABLES MUST BE CONDUCTED TO STRENGTHEN THE STUDY FINDINGS.	2021

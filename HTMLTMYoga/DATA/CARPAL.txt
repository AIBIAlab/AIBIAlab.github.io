1   49 109 A COMPARATIVE CLINICAL STUDY OF SHATAPATRAYADI CHURNA TABLET AND PATOLADI YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF AMLAPITTA. AMLAPITTA IS A VERY COMMON DISEASE CAUSED BY VIDAGDHA PITTA WITH FEATURES SUCH AS AMLODGARA, HRID KANTHA DAHA, AND AVIPAKA. THIS IS A BURNING PROBLEM OF THE SOCIETY. IRREGULAR AND IMPROPER FOOD HABITS, AND BUSY STRESSFUL LIFESTYLE IS ONE OF THE MAIN CULPRIT. AMLAPITTA IS THE GI DISORDER DESCRIBED IN AYURVEDIC TEXTS THAT CLOSELY RESEMBLES WITH GASTRITIS IN MODERN SCIENCE. IN CHRONIC STAGE, IT MAY LEAD TO ULCERATIVE CONDITIONS. IN THIS STUDY, TOTAL 41 PATIENTS WERE REGISTERED AND WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS. IN GROUP A, SHATAPATRAYADICHURNA TABLET AND IN GROUP B PATOLADI YOGA TABLET WERE GIVEN FOR 1 MONTH. THE NIDANA, SIGNS, AND SYMPTOMS WERE OBSERVED CAREFULLY TO GET IDEA ABOUT THE SAMPRAPTI OF THE DISEASE. THE EFFECT OF PATOLADI YOGA ON ROGA BALA IS 65.79%, 62.11% ON AGNI BALA, AND 63.35% ON DEHA AND CHETASA BALA. THE OVERALL RELIEF WAS 63.75%. THE EFFECT OF SHATAPATRAYADI TABLET ON ROGA BALA WAS 71.94%, 73.15% ON AGNI BALA, AND 77.68% ON DEHA AND CHETAS BALA. THE OVERALL RELIEF WAS 74.25%.	2011

3 2865  22 YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION FOR CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME: A RANDOMIZED TRIAL. CONTEXT: CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME IS A COMMON COMPLICATION OF REPETITIVE ACTIVITIES AND CAUSES SIGNIFICANT MORBIDITY. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A YOGA-BASED REGIMEN FOR RELIEVING SYMPTOMS OF CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME. DESIGN: RANDOMIZED, SINGLE-BLIND, CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: A GERIATRIC CENTER AND AN INDUSTRIAL SITE IN 1994-1995. PATIENTS: FORTY-TWO EMPLOYED OR RETIRED INDIVIDUALS WITH CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME (MEDIAN AGE, 52 YEARS; RANGE, 24-77 YEARS). INTERVENTION: SUBJECTS ASSIGNED TO THE YOGA GROUP RECEIVED A YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION CONSISTING OF 11 YOGA POSTURES DESIGNED FOR STRENGTHENING, STRETCHING, AND BALANCING EACH JOINT IN THE UPPER BODY ALONG WITH RELAXATION GIVEN TWICE WEEKLY FOR 8 WEEKS. PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP WERE OFFERED A WRIST SPLINT TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR CURRENT TREATMENT. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CHANGES FROM BASELINE TO 8 WEEKS IN GRIP STRENGTH, PAIN INTENSITY, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, PHALEN SIGN, AND TINEL SIGN, AND IN MEDIAN NERVE MOTOR AND SENSORY CONDUCTION TIME. RESULTS: SUBJECTS IN THE YOGA GROUPS HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN GRIP STRENGTH (INCREASED FROM 162 TO 187 MM HG; P = .009) AND PAIN REDUCTION (DECREASED FROM 5.0 TO 2.9 MM; P = .02), BUT CHANGES IN GRIP STRENGTH AND PAIN WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR CONTROL SUBJECTS. THE YOGA GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY MORE IMPROVEMENT IN PHALEN SIGN (12 IMPROVED VS 2 IN CONTROL GROUP; P = .008), BUT NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND IN SLEEP DISTURBANCE, TINEL SIGN, AND MEDIAN NERVE MOTOR AND SENSORY CONDUCTION TIME. CONCLUSION: IN THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY, A YOGA-BASED REGIMEN WAS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN WRIST SPLINTING OR NO TREATMENT IN RELIEVING SOME SYMPTOMS AND SIGNS OF CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME.	1998

HETERODIMERIC RAG GTPASES PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN RELAYING FLUCTUATING LEVELS OF CELLULAR AMINO ACIDS TO THE SENSOR MECHANISTIC TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN COMPLEX 1. IMPORTANT MECHANISTIC QUESTIONS REMAIN UNRESOLVED, HOWEVER, REGARDING HOW GUANINE NUCLEOTIDE BINDING ENABLES RAG GTPASES TO TRANSITION DYNAMICALLY BETWEEN DISTINCT YOGA-LIKE STRUCTURAL POSES THAT CONTROL ACTIVATION STATE. EGRI AND SHEN IDENTIFIED A CRITICAL INTERDOMAIN HYDROGEN BOND WITHIN RAGA AND RAGC THAT STABILIZES THEIR GDP-BOUND STATES.

OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, NUCLEOSIDES HAVE MAINTAINED A PROMINENT ROLE AS ONE OF THE CORNERSTONES OF ANTIVIRAL AND ANTICANCER THERAPEUTICS, AND MANY APPROACHES TO NUCLEOSIDE DRUG DESIGN HAVE BEEN PURSUED. ONE SUCH APPROACH INVOLVES FLEXIBILITY IN THE SUGAR MOIETY OF NUCLEOSIDES, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL ANTI-HIV AND HBV DRUG TENOFOVIR. IN CONTRAST, INTRODUCTION OF FLEXIBILITY TO THE NUCLEOBASE SCAFFOLD HAS ONLY MORE RECENTLY GAINED SIGNIFICANCE WITH THE INVENTION OF OUR FLEXIMERS.

6   52  33 A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF BILVADI YOGA ASHCHYOTANA AND EYE DROPS IN VATAJA ABHISHYANDA (SIMPLE ALLERGIC CONJUNCTIVITIS). SIMPLE ALLERGIC CONJUNCTIVITIS IS THE MOST COMMON FORM OF OCULAR ALLERGY (PREVALENCE 5 - 22 %). IT IS A HYPERSENSITIVITY REACTION TO SPECIFIC AIRBORNE ANTIGENS. THE DISEASE VATAJA ABHISHYANDA, WHICH IS DUE TO VITIATION OF VATA PRADHANA TRIDOSHA IS COMPARABLE WITH THIS CONDITION. THE MANAGEMENT OF SIMPLE ALLERGIC CONJUNCTIVITIS IN MODERN OPHTHALMOLOGY IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND IT SHOULD BE FOLLOWED LIFELONG AND AYURVEDA CAN PROVIDE BETTER RELIEF IN SUCH MANIFESTATION. THIS IS THE FIRST RESEARCH STUDY ON VATAJA ABHISHYANDA. PATIENTS WERE SELECTED FROM THE OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENT (OPD), INPATIENT DEPARTMENT (IPD), OF THE SHALAKYA TANTRA DEPARTMENT AND WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS. IN GROUP-A BILVADI ASHCHYOTANA AND IN GROUP-B BILVADI EYE DROPS WERE INSTILLED FOR THREE MONTHS. TOTAL 32 PATIENTS WERE REGISTERED AND 27 PATIENTS COMPLETED THE COURSE OF TREATMENT. BILVADI ASHCHYOTANA GAVE BETTER RESULTS IN TODA, SANGHARSHA, PARUSHYA, KANDU AND RAGATA AS COMPARED WITH BILVADI EYE DROPS IN VATAJA ABHISHYANDA.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
7 2694  15 YOGA INDUCED ACUTE ULNAR NERVE COMPRESSION BY A GANGLION CYST IN GUYON'S CANAL. ACUTE ULNAR NEUROPATHY AT THE WRIST CAN BE DIFFICULT TO DIAGNOSE, AS IT IS AN UNCOMMON NEUROPATHY WITH VARIABLE CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS AND NUMEROUS ETIOLOGIES. WE PRESENT A CASE OF ACUTE ULNAR NEUROPATHY OF THE DEEP MOTOR BRANCH CAUSED BY A GANGLION CYST IN GUYON'S CANAL. INTERESTINGLY, THIS CASE OF ACUTE LOSS OF MOTOR FUNCTION OCCURRED AFTER THE PATIENT PARTICIPATED IN YOGA (SPECIFICALLY THE DOWNWARD DOG POSITION), AND RESOLVED SPONTANEOUSLY OVER TIME AFTER STOPPING YOGA, WITHOUT SURGICAL EXCISION OF THE GANGLION, SUGGESTING EXACERBATION OR PROTRUSION OF AN OCCULT GANGLION CYST DUE TO INCREASED ACTIVITY AND COMPRESSION OF THE HYPOTHENAR EMINENCE.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
8 1819  19 PROTEIN YOGA: CONFORMATIONAL VERSATILITY OF THE HEMOLYSIN II C-TERMINAL DOMAIN DETAILED BY NMR STRUCTURES FOR MULTIPLE STATES. THE C-TERMINAL DOMAIN OF BACILLUS CEREUS HEMOLYSIN II (HLYIIC), STABILIZES THE TRANS-MEMBRANE-PORE FORMED BY THE HLYII TOXIN AND MAY AID IN TARGET CELL RECOGNITION. INITIAL EFFORTS TO DETERMINE THE NMR STRUCTURE OF HLYIIC WERE HAMPERED BY CIS/TRANS ISOMERIZATION ABOUT THE SINGLE PROLINE AT POSITION 405 THAT LEADS TO DOUBLING OF NMR RESONANCES. WE USED THE MUTANT P405M-HLYIIC THAT ELIMINATES THE CIS PROLINE TO DETERMINE THE NMR STRUCTURE OF THE DOMAIN, WHICH REVEALED A NOVEL FOLD. HERE, WE EXTEND EARLIER STUDIES TO THE NMR STRUCTURE DETERMINATION OF THE CIS AND TRANS STATES OF WT-HLYIIC THAT EXIST SIMULTANEOUSLY IN SOLUTION. THE PRIMARY STRUCTURAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CIS AND TRANS STATES ARE IN THE LOOP THAT CONTAINS P405, AND STRUCTURALLY ADJACENT LOOPS. THERMODYNAMIC LINKAGE ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT AT 25 C THE CIS PROLINE, WHICH ALREADY HAS A LARGE FRACTION OF 20% IN THE UNFOLDED PROTEIN, INCREASES TO 50% IN THE FOLDED STATE DUE TO COUPLING WITH THE GLOBAL STABILITY OF THE DOMAIN. THE P405M OR P405A SUBSTITUTIONS ELIMINATE HETEROGENEITY DUE TO PROLINE ISOMERIZATION BUT LEAD TO THE FORMATION OF A NEW DIMERIC SPECIES. THE NMR STRUCTURE OF THE DIMER SHOWS THAT IT IS FORMED THROUGH DOMAIN-SWAPPING OF STRAND BETA5, THE LAST SEGMENT OF SECONDARY STRUCTURE FOLLOWING P405. THE PRESENCE OF P405 IN WT-HLYIIC STRONGLY DISFAVORS THE DIMER COMPARED TO THE P405M-HLYIIC OR P405A-HLYIIC MUTANTS. THE WT PROLINE MAY THUS ACT AS A "GATEKEEPER," WARDING OFF AGGREGATIVE MISFOLDING.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
9 1736  21 PHOTO URTICARIA CAUSED BY EXPOSURE TO LED EMITTING 633-NM WAVELENGTH DURING HOT YOGA EXERCISE. PHOTO URTICARIA (PU) IS A RARE TYPE OF URTICARIA THAT DEVELOPS AFTER EXPOSURE TO VARIOUS WAVELENGTHS OF LIGHT. INDUCING URTICARIAL WHEALS USING LIGHT SOURCES OF PERTINENT WAVELENGTHS CAN HELP MAKE THE DEFINITIVE DIAGNOSIS OF PU. THE ACTION SPECTRA (AS) IN JAPANESE PATIENTS WITH PU COMMONLY FALL WITHIN THE ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION A AND VISIBLE LIGHT RANGE. HEREIN, TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, WE PRESENT THE FIRST CASE OF PU CAUSED BY 633-NM WAVELENGTH WITHIN THE VISIBLE LIGHT SPECTRUM. OUR PATIENT WORKED AS A "HOT YOGA" INSTRUCTOR, WHERE LIGHT-EMITTING DIODES (LEDS) ON THE CEILING WERE USED TO IRRADIATE THE ENTIRE ROOM WITH 633-NM WAVELENGTH OF LIGHT FOR "LIGHT TREATMENT." SHE REPORTED ITCHING AND WHEALS ON THE FACE AND NECK DURING HER "HOT YOGA" SESSIONS. "HOT YOGA" HAS RECENTLY GAINED POPULARITY GLOBALLY. THE "LIGHT TREATMENT" IS BASED ON THE THEORY THAT 633-NM WAVELENGTH LIGHT WITHIN THE VISIBLE LIGHT SPECTRUM REPORTEDLY PREVENTS THE SKIN FROM AGING. WE INDUCED WHEALS WITH ERYTHEMA BY IRRADIATING HER SKIN USING A 633-NM LED AT A DOSE OF 0.008 J/CM(2) /S FOR 1 H. HER CONDITION WAS DIAGNOSED AS PU CAUSED BY EXPOSURE TO 633 NM. LIGHT. HER SYMPTOMS HAVE NOT RECURRED SINCE SHE HAS AVOIDED BEING EXPOSED TO THE 633-NM WAVELENGTH OF LED LIGHT.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
10   42  16 A CASE OF RECTUS SHEATH HEMATOMA CAUSED BY YOGA EXERCISE. RECTUS SHEATH HEMATOMA IS A RELATIVELY RARE CONDITION BUT A SIGNIFICANT CAUSE OF ACUTE ABDOMINAL PAIN. THE ACUTE ABDOMINAL PAIN ASSOCIATED WITH RECTUS SHEATH HEMATOMA CAN MIMIC SEVERAL CONDITIONS, SUCH AS APPENDICITIS, INTESTINAL PROBLEMS (OBSTRUCTION, PERFORATION, HERNIA, MALIGNANCY), AND GYNECOLOGIC DISEASE (OVARIAN CYST, TORSION, TUBO-OVARIAN ABSCESS, ECTOPIC PREGNANCY). CORRECT DIAGNOSIS AND SUBSEQUENT TREATMENT DEPENDS ON CAREFUL HISTORY TAKING AND APPROPRIATE USE OF DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS TO AVOID UNNECESSARY LAPAROTOMY. WE REPORT A CASE OF RECTUS SHEATH HEMATOMA DUE TO NONCONTACT STRENUOUS EXERCISE, YOGA, THAT MIMICKED GYNECOLOGIC DISEASES.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
11  481  34 CLINICAL EFFICACY OF APAMARGA KSHARA YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SHVITRA (VITILIGO). INTRODUCTION: VITILIGO IS A PROGRESSIVE, IDIOPATHIC, PIGMENTATION DISORDER OF THE SKIN, CHARACTERIZED BY HYPOPIGMENTED PATCHES. THIS CONDITION IS COMPARED WITH SHVITRA IN AYURVEDA. MANY AYURVEDIC DRUGS ARE BENEFICIAL IN SUCH CASES AND APAMARGA KSHARA YOGA IS ONE AMONG THEM. AIM: TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF APAMARGA KSHARA YOGA IN LEPA AND OINTMENT FORMS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SHVITRA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TOTAL 50 PATIENTS OF SHVITRA WERE RANDOMLY GROUPED INTO TWO. PATIENTS REGISTERED IN GROUP A (N = 25) WERE TREATED WITH APAMARGA KSHARA YOGA LEPA AND GROUP B (N = 25) WITH APAMARGA KSHARA YOGA OINTMENT FOR 2 MONTHS. RASAYANA CHURNA (3G) ALONG WITH HONEY AND GHEE WAS GIVEN TWICE DAILY INTERNALLY IN THE BOTH GROUPS. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT WAS FOUND IN THE SYMPTOMS OF SHVITRA WITH TREATMENT IN BOTH THE GROUPS. THE DIFFERENCE IN BETWEEN THE GROUPS WAS STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT. CONCLUSION: BOTH FORMS OF APAMRAGA KSHARA YOGA ARE EFFECTIVE IN CASES OF SHVITRA AND CAN BE GOOD ALTERNATIVES FOR CONTEMPORARY MEDICINES.	2015

THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT EFFECTIVELY ESTABLISHING A HOLDING ENVIRONMENT CAN FACILITATE BOTH SOMATIC AND DEEP STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN A CLIENT, FACILITATING HEALING FROM PRIMAL WOUNDING AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL RECONNECTION TO THE TRUE SELF.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
13 1433  19 IMPROVING THE DEGREE OF PUBIC ARCH POST-YOGA EXERCISE DURING PREGNANCY. YOGA EXERCISES UNDERTAKEN DURING THE MATERNITY PERIOD MAY REDUCE UNPLEASANT SYMPTOMS DURING PREGNANCY AND REDUCE DELIVERY PAIN. FLEXIBILITY OF THE HIP JOINT IMPROVES THE DEGREE OF PUBIC ARCH CREATED IN AN OPEN-LEG POSTURE AND WIDENS THE PELVIC OUTLET REGION, SHORTENING THE TIME REQUIRED FOR DELIVERY AND FACILITATING EASY DELIVERY. THE DEGREE OF PUBIC ARCH IS RELATED TO THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE HIP JOINT. ALTHOUGH MANY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THE EFFECT OF YOGA EXERCISE DURING PREGNANCY, THE EFFECT ON THE DEGREE OF THE PUBIC ARCH HAS NOT BEEN ELUCIDATED. TO ELUCIDATE WHETHER THE DEGREE OF THE PUBIC ARCH IS IMPROVED BY YOGA EXERCISE DURING PREGNANCY, THIS STUDY ENROLLED 177 PREGNANT SUBJECTS. THE DEGREE OF PUBIC ARCH PRE- AND POST-YOGA EXERCISE WAS MEASURED USING INSTRUMENTS IN AN OPEN-LEG POSTURE (SEATED WITH FEMURS ABDUCTED). THE MEAN PUBIC ARCH PRE- AND POST-YOGA WAS 122.61 AND 127.93 DEGREES, RESPECTIVELY. THE DEGREE OF PUBIC ARCH POST-YOGA SESSIONS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED COMPARED WITH PRE-YOGA SESSIONS (P < 0.01). THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT YOGA EXERCISES DURING THE PREGNANCY PERIOD APPEAR TO IMPROVE THE DEGREE OF PUBIC ARCH.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
14  379  11 BASILAR ARTERY OCCLUSION FOLLOWING YOGA EXERCISE: A CASE REPORT. BASILAR ARTERY OCCLUSION DEVELOPED IN A 34 YEAR OLD WOMAN 2 MONTHS AFTER ADOPTING UNUSUAL NECK POSTURES DURING YOGA PRACTICE. ON ANGIOGRAPHY, HER BASILAR ARTERY WAS FILLED WITH INTRALUMINAL CLOT WHILE THE VERTEBRAL ARTERIES WERE NORMAL. WE POSTULATE THAT A SEVERE REDUCTION IN BLOOD FLOW AND POSSIBLY AN INTIMAL TEAR TRIGGERED THROMBOSIS OF THE VERTEBRAL ARTERY AND THAT THE FINAL STROKE MECHANISM WAS ARTERY-TO-ARTERY EMBOLISM.	1993

16  409  20 BLENDING MARTIAL ARTS AND YOGA FOR HEALTH: FROM THE LAST SAMURAI TO THE FIRST ODAKA YOGA WARRIOR. THIS PAPER INTRODUCES THE CASE STUDY OF ODAKA YOGA, AN INNOVATIVE STYLE OF POSTURAL YOGA BLENDED WITH MARTIAL ARTS ELEMENTS WHICH EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF PRACTITIONERS' HEALTH AND PROCESSES OF SELF-TRANSFORMATION AS PIVOTAL TO THE SCHOOL'S ETHOS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE PAPER EXPLORES HOW ODAKA YOGA'S PHILOSOPHICAL BACKDROPS AND PRACTICAL REPERTOIRE, COMPOSED BY A MIXTURE OF "EXOTIC" RESOURCES SUCH AS BUSHIDO, ZEN, YOGA, AND A CONSTANT REFERENCE TO THE OCEAN WAVES AND BIOMECHANICS, CONSTITUTE A VERY SPECIFIC VISION OF HEALTH AT THE INTERSECTION OF WESTERN SCIENCE AND ESOTERIC KNOWLEDGE. THEORETICALLY, THE PAPER BORROWS FROM JENNINGS' THEORY OF MARTIAL CREATION AND ENRICHES IT WITH SOME OF THE CENTRAL ANALYTICAL TOOLS PROPOSED BY THEORISTS SUCH AS BOURDIEU AND FOUCAULT. METHODOLOGICALLY, IT RELIES ON A MULTIMODAL APPROACH INCLUDING DISCURSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE SCHOOL'S PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS, INTERVIEWS WITH THE FOUNDERS AND OTHER KEY TEACHERS, AND OBSERVANT PARTICIPATION OF PRACTITIONERS' APPRENTICESHIP PROCESSES. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE BIRTH OF ODAKA YOGA AS OCCURRING AT THE INTERSECTION OF ASIAN MARTIAL ARTS AND YOGA, AS WELL AS THE FOUNDERS' BIOGRAPHICAL TRAJECTORIES FROM THE WORLD OF COMPETITIVE MARTIAL ARTS AND FITNESS, TO YOGA; IT THEN TURNS TO AN EXAMINATION OF ODAKA YOGA'S CONCEPTION OF HEALTH AS A MIXTURE OF THE WESTERN BIOMEDICAL MODEL AND THE SUBTLE BODY MODEL OF ASIAN TRADITIONS SUCH AS YOGA AND MARTIAL ARTS. IT ARGUES THAT THE CONCEPTION OF HEALTH PROMOTED BY THIS SCHOOL GIVES RISE TO THE ODAKA YOGA WARRIOR, THE IDEAL-TYPICAL PRACTITIONER WHOSE BODY IS SIMULTANEOUSLY EXPOSED TO THE MEDICAL GAZE AND ITS IMPERATIVES OF CONTROL, KNOWLEDGE, AND MANIPULATION; WHILE IT ALSO DEIFIES IT, AS IT IS ANIMATED BY THE ELUSIVE FLOWS OF ENERGY (QI OR PRANA) THAT PROLONGED PRACTICE AIMS TO MASTER. THE PAPER CONCLUDES WITH A REFLECTION ON HYBRID CONCEPTIONS OF HEALTH AND THE UBIQUITOUS ROLE OF HEALTH DISCOURSES AND NARRATIVES ACROSS SOCIOCULTURAL DOMAINS.	2020

WE PERFORMED AN AUTOMATED SEARCH IN THE DATABASE OF A LARGE TERTIARY CARE CENTER AND CONDUCTED A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE IMAGING FINDINGS IN 38 PATIENTS OVER A 9-YEAR PERIOD. CONCLUSION: THE MOST FREQUENTLY ENCOUNTERED MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURIES WERE TENDINOUS LESIONS, INCLUDING TEARS OF THE SUPRASPINATUS, ACHILLES, AND PERONEUS BREVIS TENDONS AND FIBROCARTILAGINOUS TEARS INVOLVING THE MEDIAL MENISCUS, ACETABULAR LABRUM, GLENOID LABRUM, AND LUMBAR DISK WITH EXTRUSION.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
18 1013  18 EFFECTS OF ONLINE YOGA AND TAI CHI ON PHYSICAL HEALTH OUTCOME MEASURES OF ADULT INFORMAL CAREGIVERS. AIMS: THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF ONLINE VINYASA YOGA (VY) AND TAIJIFIT (12 WEEKS) IN INFORMAL CAREGIVERS (>/=18 YEARS OF AGE). METHODS: TWENTY-NINE PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO TWO GROUPS: VY (N = 16, 55.87 +/- 12.31 YEARS) OR TAIJIFIT (N = 13, 55.07 +/- 12.65 YEARS). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PRIOR TO AND FOLLOWING THE STUDY, ASSESSMENTS WERE MADE FOR MUSCLE STRENGTH (1-RM LEG PRESS, CHEST PRESS, AND HANDGRIP), MUSCLE ENDURANCE (LEG PRESS AND CHEST PRESS; MAXIMAL NUMBER OF REPETITIONS PERFORMED TO FATIGUE AT 80% AND 70% BASELINE 1-RM, RESPECTIVELY), ABDOMINAL ENDURANCE (MAXIMUM NUMBER OF CONSECUTIVE CURL-UPS TO FATIGUE), TASKS OF FUNCTIONALITY (DYNAMIC BALANCE AND WALKING SPEED), AND FLEXIBILITY (SIT AND REACH). RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OVER TIME FOR MUSCLE STRENGTH, MUSCLE ENDURANCE, TASKS OF FUNCTIONALITY, AND FLEXIBILITY (P = 0.001). THE VY GROUP EXPERIENCED A GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN CHEST PRESS ENDURANCE (VY: PRE 19.25 +/- 5.90, POST 28.06 +/- 7.60 REPS; TAIJIFIT PRE 15.69 +/- 4.49, POST 21.07 +/- 5.85 REPS; P = 0.019) AND ABDOMINAL ENDURANCE (VY: PRE 37.12 +/- 31.26, POST 68.43 +/- 55.07 REPS; TAIJIFIT PRE 19.23 +/- 19.00, POST 32.07 +/- 20.87 REPS; P = 0.034) COMPARED TO THE TAIJIFIT GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: VY AND TAIJIFIT ARE EFFECTIVE FOR IMPROVING MUSCLE STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE, TASKS OF FUNCTIONALITY, AND FLEXIBILITY IN INFORMAL CAREGIVERS. VY LED TO GREATER GAINS IN CHEST PRESS ENDURANCE AND ABDOMINAL CURL-UPS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
19 1993  18 STANDARDISATION OF KUTAJADI VISHESH YOGA. AMOEBIASIS IS A PROBLEM IN NORTHERN INDIA. IN AYURVEDA SEVERAL HERBAL DRUGS ARE MENTIONED, TO BE USED FOR CONTROLLING THE AMATISARA (AMOEBIASIS) BUT NONE OF THE DRUG ARE FOUND HAVING POTENT EFFECT TO IRADICATE THE DISEASE. IN ANCIENT LITERATURE KUTAJ (HOLARRHENA ANTIDYSENTRICA) IS MENTIONED IN COMMONEST WAS FOR CONTROLLING THE DISEASE THIS PLANT IS PREVALENTLY FOUND IN HIMALAYAN AND VINDHAYA AREA. IT IS VERY EFFECTIVE FOR RELIEVING AMOEBIASIS. BY SEEING ITS THEURAPTIC IMPORTANCE WE HAVE TRIED TO STANDARDIZE THE COMPOUND IN WHOLE WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO KUTAJ. THE DETAIL COMPOSITION AND METHOD OF PREPARATION OF DRUG WITH ITS THERAPEUTIC EFFECT WILL BE NARRATED DURING THE TIME OF WORKSHOP.	1998	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
20 1416  12 IMPORTANCE OF MANAS TATTVA: A SEARCHLIGHT IN YOGA DARSHANA. SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL 'MANAS' HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF CURIOSITY FOR SCHOLARS, SCIENTISTS AND PHILOSOPHERS. THE REASON BEHIND THIS CURIOSITY IS ITS IMPORTANCE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF MANKIND. HUMAN BEING IS SUPERIOR TO OTHER CREATURES IN THE SERIES OF DEVELOPMENT. THIS SUPREMACY OF MAN REMAINS IN HIS QUALITY TO WORK AFTER THINKING, WHICH IS THE FUNCTION OF 'MANAS'. NO OTHER ANIMAL IS CAPABLE TO THINK LOGICALLY. THIS IS THE ONLY REASON WHICH LEADS THE MANKIND TO THE CREST OF DEVELOPMENT IN EVERY ASPECT. TO HIGHLIGHT THE CONCEPT OF MANAS IN YOGA DARSHANA, INFORMATION EXTRACTED FROM YOGA LITERATURES AND AYURVEDIC SAMHITAS. IN INDIAN CULTURE MIND HAS BEEN DESCRIBED FROM VARIOUS ANGLES. VEDIC, PHILOSOPHICAL AND AYURVEDIC LITERATURES HAVE A VAST AND EXCLUSIVE DESCRIPTION OF MANAS. PHILOSOPHERS EITHER ASTIKA OR NASTIKA HAVE DESCRIBED MANAS SIDDHANTA VIVIDLY. THOUGH MANY KINDS OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINIONS ARE THERE, YOGA DARSHANA ACCEPT THE IMPORTANCE OF MIND IN THE PROCESS OF PERCEPTION AND EVEN FOR THE BIRTH OF ANY INDIVIDUAL.	2014

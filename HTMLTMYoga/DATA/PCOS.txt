1  704 88 EFFECT OF INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA AND NATUROPATHY ON POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME: A CASE STUDY. OWING TO STRESS, SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE AND CHANGES IN DIET PATTERN, THERE IS AN INCREASE IN THE SURGE OF LIFESTYLE AND METABOLIC DISORDERS. POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME (PCOS) AFFECTS 8-13% OF REPRODUCTIVE-AGED WOMEN. PCOS IS CHARACTERISED BY MENSTRUAL IRREGULARITY, HYPERANDROGENISM AND POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN MORPHOLOGY (PCOM). THE EFFICACY OF YOGA AS A THERAPY TO TACKLE THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT CAUSE OF AILMENT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PCOS IS TO BE DOCUMENTED. THIS IS THE CASE STUDY OF A FEMALE PATIENT AGE 25 YEARS, A DIAGNOSED CASE OF PCOS WAS REGISTERED AT THE AYURVEDA, YOGA, UNANI,SIDDHA,HOMEOPATHY (AYUSH), YOGA OPD, WITH COMPLAINTS OF IRREGULAR MENSTRUATION, TREATED SUCCESSFULLY BY YOGA AND NATUROPATHY (Y AND N), I.E., YOGA, DIET AND LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION. THIS IS EVIDENT FROM THE REDUCTION IN WEIGHT, REGULARISATION OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE ALONG WITH MORPHOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE OVARY AFTER A FOLLOW-UP OF 6 MONTHS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
2  840 33 EFFECT OF YOGA ON POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME (PCOS) IS NOT A DISEASE BUT A MERE SYNDROME. MANY RESEARCHERS HAVE STUDIED POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME AND FOUND THAT THERE IS NO PROPER CAUSE OF THAT, IT MAY OCCUR DUE TO HORMONAL IMBALANCE OR STRESS, OR DUE TO A SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE. THE RATE OF POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME IN INDIAN WOMEN HAS BEEN INCREASING RAPIDLY. THE SYMPTOMS INCLUDE ACNE, WEIGHT GAIN, HIRSUTISM, DIFFICULTIES IN FERTILITY, IRREGULAR OR INFREQUENT PERIODS, IMMATURE OVARIAN EGGS THAT DO NOT OVULATE, MULTIPLE CYSTS IN THE OVARY. IF LEFT UNTREATED, IT MAY BECOME THE CAUSE FOR HEART DISEASES, DIABETES, HYPERTENSION, INFERTILITY, AND EVEN CANCER. THERE ARE VARIETIES OF MEDICAL TREATMENTS AVAILABLE TO TREAT POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME BUT THEY HAVE A TEMPORARY EFFECT AND IF TAKEN FOR A LONG TIME THEN IT MAY LEAD TO SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS. YOGA HAS PROVEN EFFECTS IN REDUCING AND MANAGING THE SYMPTOMS OF POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME MORE EFFECTIVELY ALONG WITH MEDICINE. THIS REVIEW WORK HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO CONSIDER THE AVAILABLE LITERATURE CONCERNING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME. IT INCLUDES SOME RESEARCH PAPERS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 2012 AND 2019. BY PROVIDING YOGIC TREATMENT EFFECT ON SEVERAL PARAMETERS (SUCH AS BLOOD LIPID LEVEL, GLUCOSE METABOLISM, ENDOCRINE PARAMETERS, QUALITY OF LIFE, RESTING CARDIOVASCULAR PARAMETERS, LEVEL OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION) ON THE WOMAN WITH POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME WERE MEASURED. AFTER THOROUGHLY STUDYING ABOUT 74 RESEARCH PAPERS, 16 ARE FOUND MOST RELEVANT TO BE REVIEWED. THE STUDIES OF THESE PAPERS CONCLUDED THE SUCCESSFUL USE OF DIFFERENT YOGIC LIMBS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME WITH OR WITHOUT MEDICATIONS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
3  954 23 EFFECTS OF A HOLISTIC YOGA PROGRAM ON ENDOCRINE PARAMETERS IN ADOLESCENTS WITH POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: THE OBJECTIVES OF THIS TRIAL WERE TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF A HOLISTIC YOGA PROGRAM WITH THE CONVENTIONAL EXERCISE PROGRAM IN ADOLESCENT POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME (PCOS). DESIGN: THIS WAS A PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, ACTIVE CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: NINETY (90) ADOLESCENT (15-18 YEARS) GIRLS FROM A RESIDENTIAL COLLEGE IN ANDHRA PRADESH WHO SATISFIED THE ROTTERDAM CRITERIA WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS. INTERVENTION: THE YOGA GROUP PRACTICED A HOLISTIC YOGA MODULE, WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP PRACTICED A MATCHING SET OF PHYSICAL EXERCISES (1 HOUR/DAY, FOR 12 WEEKS). OUTCOME MEASURES: ANTI-MULLERIAN HORMONE (AMH-PRIMARY OUTCOME), LUTEINIZING HORMONE (LH), FOLLICLE-STIMULATING HORMONE (FSH), TESTOSTERONE, PROLACTIN, BODY-MASS INDEX (BMI), HIRSUTISM, AND MENSTRUAL FREQUENCY WERE MEASURED AT INCLUSION AND AFTER 12 WEEKS. RESULTS: MANN-WHITNEY TEST ON DIFFERENCE SCORE SHOWS THAT CHANGES IN AMH (Y=-2.51, C=-0.49, P=0.006), LH, AND LH/FSH RATIO (LH: Y=-4.09, C=3.00, P=0.005; LH/FSH: Y=-1.17, C=0.49, P=0.015) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE TWO INTERVENTION GROUPS. ALSO, CHANGES IN TESTOSTERONE (Y=-6.01, C=2.61, P=0.014) AND MODIFIED FERRIMAN AND GALLWAY (MFG) SCORE (Y=-1.14, C=+0.06, P=0.002) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. ON THE OTHER HAND, CHANGES IN FSH AND PROLACTIN POSTINTERVENTION WERE NONSIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. ALSO, BODY WEIGHT AND BMI SHOWED NONSIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT CHANGES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS, WHILE CHANGES IN MENSTRUAL FREQUENCY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS (Y=0.89, C=0.49, P=0.049). CONCLUSIONS: A HOLISTIC YOGA PROGRAM FOR 12 WEEKS IS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN PHYSICAL EXERCISE IN REDUCING AMH, LH, AND TESTOSTERONE, MFG SCORE FOR HIRSUTISM, AND IMPROVING MENSTRUAL FREQUENCY WITH NONSIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN BODY WEIGHT, FSH, AND PROLACTIN IN ADOLESCENT PCOS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
4  483 39 CLINICAL EFFICACY OF VAMANA KARMA WITH IKSHWAAKU BEEJA YOGA FOLLOWED BY SHATAPUSHPADI GHANAVATI IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ARTAVA KSHAYA W. S. R TO POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME. BACKGROUND: DUE TO SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE AND STRESS, THE INCIDENCE OF METABOLIC DISORDERS ARE INCREASING DAY BY DAY. AMONG THESE POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME (PCOS) IS AN INTRICATE DISORDER AFFECTING 4%-8% WOMEN IN THEIR REPRODUCTIVE AGE AND RELATED TO OVARIAN DYSFUNCTION CHARACTERIZED BY OBESITY, OLIGOMENORRHEA, ANOVULATION AND HYPERANDROGENISM. IN MODERN SYSTEM OF MEDICINE, THE AVAILABLE ALLOPATHIC REGIMEN HAS ITS OWN LIMITATIONS, SO IT IS NEED OF TIME TO FIND A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE THERAPY FOR SUCH TYPE OF CONDITION. THE MOST COMMON SYMPTOM IN 85%-90% OF PCOS PATIENTS IS OLIGOMENORRHEA WHICH CAN BE CORRELATED TO ARTAVA KSHAYA (LOSS OF MENSTRUAL FLUID) IN AYURVEDA. HENCE, IN THE PRESENT CLINICAL STUDY, VAMANA KARMA (THERAPEUTIC VOMITING) WITH IKSHWAAKU SEED FORMULATION FOLLOWED BY SHATAPUSHPADI GHANAVATI WAS PLANNED. AIMS: TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF VAMANA KARMA (THERAPEUTIC VOMITING) FOLLOWED BY SHATAPUSHPADI GHANAVATI IN THE MANAGEMENT OF AARTAVA KSHAYA (LOSS OF MENSTRUAL FLUID) W. S. R TO PCOS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 15 PATIENTS OF PCOS WERE CLINICALLY DIAGNOSED AND TREATED BY VAMANA KARMA (THERAPEUTIC VOMITING) PROCEDURE WITH IKSHWAAKU SEED FORMULATION. AFTER COMPLETION OF VAMANA KARMA (THERAPEUTIC VOMITING) AND SAMSARJANA KRAMA, (POST THERAPY DIETARY REGIMEN FOR REVIVAL) SHATAPUSHPADI GHANAVATI 2 VATI (EACH 500 MG) TWICE IN A DAY WITH LUKEWARM WATER WAS GIVEN FOR 45 DAYS. AFTER COMPLETION OF 2-MONTH TRIAL, ASSESSMENT OF THERAPY WAS ESTIMATED BY SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE PARAMETERS. RESULTS: STATISTICALLY EXTREMELY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.0001) RESULTS WERE FOUND IN MENSTRUAL IRREGULARITIES, OBESITY, AND BODY MASS INDEX. THE SIGNIFICANT RESULT IN REDUCTION OF NONDOMINANT FOLLICLES (P = 0.01 AND 0.03 FOR RIGHT AND LEFT OVARY, RESPECTIVELY), LOWERING THE FASTING BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL (P = 0.02) AND HIRSUTISM (P = 0.03) WAS FOUND. CONCLUSION: VAMANA KARMA (THERAPEUTIC VOMITING) FOLLOWED BY SHATAPUSHPADI GHANAVATI IS VERY EFFECTIVE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF OBESE PCOS PATIENTS AND INCREASING CHANCES OF CONCEPTION.	2017	
                                                               
5  679 22 EFFECT OF A YOGA PROGRAM ON GLUCOSE METABOLISM AND BLOOD LIPID LEVELS IN ADOLESCENT GIRLS WITH POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME. OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF YOGA THERAPY ON GLUCOSE METABOLISM AND BLOOD LIPID VALUES IN ADOLESCENT GIRLS WITH POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME (PCOS). METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, INTERVENTIONAL CONTROLLED TRIAL RECRUITED 90 ADOLESCENTS AGED BETWEEN 15 AND 18 YEARS WHO MET THE ROTTERDAM CRITERIA FOR PCOS. A YOGA GROUP PRACTICED SURYANAMASKARA, ASANAS, PRANAYAMA, AND MEDITATION 1 HOUR PER DAY EACH DAY FOR 12 WEEKS WHILE ANOTHER GROUP PRACTICED CONVENTIONAL PHYSICAL EXERCISES. THE MANN-WHITNEY U TEST WAS USED TO COMPARE SCORE CHANGES BETWEEN THE 2 GROUPS. RESULTS: THE CHANGES IN FASTING INSULIN, FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE, AND HOMEOSTASIS MODEL ASSESSMENT OF INSULIN RESISTANCE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT IN THE 2 GROUPS (P<0.05). EXCEPT FOR HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL, THE CHANGES IN BLOOD LIPID VALUES WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT (P<0.05). THE CHANGES IN BODY MASS INDEX, WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE, HIP CIRCUMFERENCE, AND WAIST-TO-HIP RATIO, HOWEVER, WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT (P>0.05). CONCLUSION: YOGA WAS FOUND TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN CONVENTIONAL PHYSICAL EXERCISES IN IMPROVING GLUCOSE, LIPID, AND INSULIN VALUES, INCLUDING INSULIN RESISTANCE VALUES, IN ADOLESCENT GIRLS WITH PCOS INDEPENDENT OF ANTHROPOMETRIC CHANGES.

6  701 22 EFFECT OF HOLISTIC YOGA PROGRAM ON ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IN ADOLESCENT GIRLS WITH POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME: A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL. CONTEXT: YOGA TECHNIQUES PRACTICED FOR VARYING DURATIONS HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE STATE ANXIETY. THIS WAS NEVER ASSESSED IN ADOLESCENTS WITH POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME (PCOS). AIMS: TO COMPARE THE EFFECT OF A HOLISTIC YOGA PROGRAM WITH THE CONVENTIONAL EXERCISE PROGRAM ON ANXIETY LEVEL IN ADOLESCENTS WITH PCOS. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: NINETY ADOLESCENT (15-18 YEARS) GIRLS FROM A RESIDENTIAL COLLEGE IN ANDHRA PRADESH, WHO SATISFIED THE ROTTERDAM CRITERIA, WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ANXIETY LEVELS WERE ASSESSED AT INCLUSION AND AFTER 12 WEEKS OF INTERVENTION WHEREIN YOGA GROUP PRACTICED A HOLISTIC YOGA MODULE WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP PRACTICED A MATCHING SET OF PHYSICAL EXERCISES (1 H/DAY, FOR 12 WEEKS). STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: MANN-WHITNEY U TEST WAS USED TO COMPARE DIFFERENCE SCORES (DELTA CHANGE) BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS RESULTS: CHANGES IN STATE ANXIETY AFTER THE INTERVENTION WERE NONSIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS (P=0.243), WHILE CHANGES AFTER THE INTERVENTION WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS (P=0.002) FOR TRAIT ANXIETY. CONCLUSIONS: TWELVE WEEKS OF A HOLISTIC YOGA PROGRAM IN ADOLESCENTS WITH PCOS IS SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN PHYSICAL EXERCISE PROGRAM IN REDUCING ANXIETY SYMPTOMS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
7 2530 23 YOGA EFFECTS ON ANTHROPOMETRIC INDICES AND POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME SYMPTOMS IN WOMEN UNDERGOING INFERTILITY TREATMENT: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA EXERCISES ON ANTHROPOMETRIC PARAMETER AND CLINICAL SIGN OF PCOS AMONG WOMEN UNDERGOING INFERTILITY TREATMENT. THIS CLINICAL TRIAL STUDY WAS PERFORMED ON 61 WOMEN WITH PCOS WHO HAVE UNDERGONE INFERTILITY TREATMENT AT SAREM HOSPITAL IN TEHRAN, IRAN. THE PATIENTS WERE FIRST SELECTING BASED ON PURPOSEFUL AND THEN RANDOMLY ASSIGNING TO THE INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS. IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP, YOGA EXERCISES WERE PERFORMED FOR 6 WEEKS AND THE PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP ONLY RECEIVED ROUTINE CARE. ANTHROPOMETRIC PARAMETERS AND CLINICAL SIGNS WERE PERFORMED AND RECORDED. AFTER THE INTERVENTION, HERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN HIRSUTISM, ABDOMINAL CIRCUMFERENCE, AND HIP CIRCUMFERENCE SCORES IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP (P < 0.05). GIVEN THE EFFECTS OF YOGA EXERCISES ON THE IMPROVEMENT OF HIRSUTISM, ABDOMINAL CIRCUMFERENCE, AND HIP CIRCUMFERENCE, IT IS SUGGESTED TO USE YOGA AS A TREATMENT STRATEGY IN WOMEN WITH PCOS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
8 1888 26 REGULAR MINDFUL YOGA PRACTICE AS A METHOD TO IMPROVE ANDROGEN LEVELS IN WOMEN WITH POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME: A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: HOLISTIC APPROACHES ARE NEEDED TO COMPLEMENT EXISTING THERAPIES FOR POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME (PCOS), A COMMON DISORDER AFFECTING THE HEALTH OF REPRODUCTIVE-AGED FEMALES. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE WHETHER THRICE-WEEKLY MINDFUL YOGA PRACTICE IMPROVES ENDOCRINE, CARDIOMETABOLIC, OR PSYCHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS IN WOMEN WITH PCOS. METHODS: THIRTY-ONE WOMEN WITH PCOS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 23 AND 42 YEARS AND LIVING IN ERIE COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA, WERE RECRUITED FOR THIS RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED STUDY ARM, WHICH WAS PART OF A LARGER 3-PART INVESTIGATION. WOMEN WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER A MINDFUL YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP OR NO INTERVENTION (CONTROL) GROUP. GROUP CLASSES WERE 1 HOUR, THRICE WEEKLY. INITIAL ENDOCRINE, CARDIOMETABOLIC, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS WERE COMPARED WITH MEASUREMENTS TAKEN AFTER THE 3-MONTH INTERVENTION PERIOD. MEASUREMENTS INCLUDED FREE TESTOSTERONE, DEHYDROEPIANDROSTERONE, ANDROSTENEDIONE, BODY MASS INDEX, WAIST-TO-HIP RATIO, FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE AND INSULIN LEVELS, AND ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCORES. RESULTS: TWENTY-TWO WOMEN COMPLETED THE 3-MONTH INTERVENTION PERIOD, 13 IN THE MINDFUL YOGA GROUP AND 9 IN THE CONTROL GROUP. PAIRED COMPARISONS OF PRE- AND POSTINTERVENTION PARAMETERS INDICATED THAT WOMEN WHO COMPLETED THE MINDFUL YOGA INTERVENTION HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER FREE TESTOSTERONE LEVELS (5.96 VS 4.24 PG/ML; P<.05) AND DEHYDROEPIANDROSTERONE LEVELS THAT TRENDED LOWER. IMPROVED TESTOSTERONE MAY PERSIST FOR SEVERAL MONTHS AFTER COMPLETION OF A 3-MONTH, THRICE-WEEKLY MINDFUL YOGA INTERVENTION. ADDITIONALLY, IMPROVEMENTS WERE SEEN IN MEASURES OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. CONCLUSION: THE IMPROVEMENTS OBSERVED SUGGEST THAT REGULAR MINDFUL YOGA PRACTICE CAN BE A USEFUL COMPLEMENTARY THERAPEUTIC OPTION FOR WOMEN WITH PCOS, PARTICULARLY FOR IMPROVING SERUM ANDROGEN LEVELS, A HALLMARK FEATURE OF PCOS. THIS IMPROVEMENT OCCURRED IN THE ABSENCE OF WEIGHT LOSS AND MAY PERSIST EVEN IF THERE IS A LAPSE IN PRACTICE. (CLINICALTRIALS.GOV NO.

9 1391 25 IMPACT OF YOGA AND EXERCISES ON POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME RISK AMONG ADOLESCENT SCHOOLGIRLS IN SOUTH INDIA. BACKGROUND: TO IDENTIFY THE ADOLESCENT SCHOOL GIRLS WITH RISK FOR POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME (PCOS), ASSESS THEIR RISK STATUS, AND EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS ON PCOS RISK REDUCTION. METHODS: AN EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED AMONG ADOLESCENT GIRLS BELONGING TO TWO GOVERNMENT RUN SCHOOLS IN TIRUVALLUR DISTRICT OF TAMIL NADU STATE, INDIA, FROM 6 JUNE TO 9 DECEMBER 2016. A STANDARD RISK ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRE WAS ADOPTED FOR RISK ASSESSMENT AFTER MAKING FEW MODIFICATIONS (CRONBACH ALPHA 0.86). THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP RECEIVED LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS (YOGA FOR TWO MONTHS AND WALKING EXERCISE FOR TWO MONTHS), WITH NO SUCH INTERVENTION PROVIDED FOR THE CONTROL GROUP. THE IMPACT OF THESE INTERVENTIONS WAS ASSESSED IN TERMS OF RISK MINIMIZATION AND A P VALUE LESS THAN .05 WAS CONSIDERED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 204 (CONTROL-102; EXPERIMENTAL-102) GIRLS WITH STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN DEMOGRAPHIC FEATURES WERE STUDIED. DURING THE PRETEST, 85.2% (N = 87) IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND 83.3% (N = 85) THE CONTROLS HAD "MODERATE RISK" FOR PCOS. GIRLS WITH "HIGH RISK" LEVEL OF PCOS WERE 14.8% (N = 15) AND 15.7% (N = 17) IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND THE CONTROL GROUP, RESPECTIVELY. IN POSTTEST-1 (AFTER YOGA SESSIONS) RISK ASSESSMENT, 71.6% HAD "MODERATE RISK," 5.9% HAD "HIGH RISK" IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP, WHEREAS 87.3% HAD "MODERATE RISK" AND 12.7% HAD "HIGH RISK" IN THE CONTROL GROUP. IN POSTTEST-2 (AFTER EXERCISE SESSIONS) RISK ASSESSMENT, 48% HAD "MODERATE RISK" AND 0% HAD HIGH RISK IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP, WHEREAS 88.2% WERE "MODERATE RISK" AND 11.8% WERE "HIGH RISK" IN THE CONTROL GROUP. REPEATED MEASURE ANOVA WITH GREENHOUSE-GEISSER CORRECTION SHOWED MEAN RISK REDUCTION SCORE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN PRETEST AND POST-TEST (33.38 +/- 7.28 VS 22.75 +/- 12.09, RESPECTIVELY MEAN DIFFERENCE IS 10.63: F = 236.12 P < .001), SUGGESTING A POSITIVE CORRELATION WITH THE INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA AND EXERCISE WERE BENEFICIAL IN MINIMIZING PCOS RISK, AS REFLECTED IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT SCORE. MORE SUCH INTERVENTIONS, COVERING DIFFERENT SCHOOLS, COULD PROVIDE LARGER HEALTH BENEFITS.	2020

OBJECTIVES: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO OBSERVE THE EFFECT OF YOGA NIDRA PRACTICE ON HORMONE LEVELS IN PATIENTS WHO HAD MENSTRUAL IRREGULARITIES. DESIGN: THE STUDY WAS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTINGS/LOCATION: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY AT CHHATRAPATI SAHUJI MAHARAJ MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, UTTAR PRADESH, LUCKNOW, INDIA. SUBJECTS WERE DIVIDED RANDOMLY INTO 2 GROUPS-AN INTERVENTION AND A CONTROL GROUP, WITH 75 SUBJECTS IN EACH GROUP. OF THESE SUBJECTS, 126 COMPLETED THE STUDY PROTOCOL. SUBJECTS: THIS STUDY INVOLVED 150 SUBJECTS WITH MENSTRUAL IRREGULARITIES; 126 OF WHOM COMPLETED THE PROTOCOL. INTERVENTIONS: THE INTERVENTION WAS THE PRACTICE OF YOGA NIDRA. THE YOGIC INTERVENTION DURATION WAS 35-40 MINUTES/DAY, FIVE TIMES/WEEK FOR 6 MONTHS. AN ESTIMATION OF HORMONAL PROFILE WAS DONE FOR BOTH GROUPS AT BASELINE AND AFTER 6 MONTHS. RESULTS: THYROID-STIMULATING HORMONE (P<0.002), FOLLICLE-STIMULATING HORMONE (P<0.02), LUTEINIZING HORMONE (P<0.001), AND PROLACTIN (P<0.02) WERE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP, COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: THE PRESENT STUDY DEMONSTRATED THE EFFICACY OF YOGA NIDRA ON HORMONE PROFILES IN PATIENTS WITH MENSTRUAL IRREGULARITIES. YOGA NIDRA PRACTICE WAS HELPFUL IN PATIENTS WITH HORMONE IMBALANCES, SUCH AS DYSMENORRHEA, OLIGOMENORRHEA, MENORRHAGIA, METRORRHAGIA, AND HYPOMENORRHEA.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
11 1030 22 EFFECTS OF YOGA EXERCISE ON SERUM ADIPONECTIN AND METABOLIC SYNDROME FACTORS IN OBESE POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. OBJECTIVE: REGULAR AND CONTINUOUS YOGA EXERCISE IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT NONPHARMACOLOGICAL METHODS OF IMPROVING SERUM LIPID CONCENTRATIONS, ADIPOSE TISSUE, AND METABOLIC SYNDROME FACTORS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ANALYZE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA EXERCISE ON SERUM ADIPONECTIN AND METABOLIC SYNDROME FACTORS IN OBESE POSTMENOPAUSAL KOREAN WOMEN. METHODS: SIXTEEN HEALTHY POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN AGED 54.50 +/- 2.75 YEARS WITH MORE THAN 36% BODY FAT WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER A YOGA EXERCISE GROUP (N = 8) OR TO A "NO EXERCISE" CONTROL GROUP (N = 8). THE VARIABLES OF BODY COMPOSITION, VISCERAL FAT, SERUM ADIPONECTIN, AND METABOLIC SYNDROME FACTORS WERE MEASURED IN ALL THE PARTICIPANTS BEFORE AND AFTER THE 16-WEEK STUDY. RESULTS: BODY WEIGHT, PERCENTAGE OF BODY FAT, LEAN BODY MASS, BODY MASS INDEX, WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE, AND VISCERAL FAT AREA HAD SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED. HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL AND ADIPONECTIN HAD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED, BUT TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDE, LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL, BLOOD PRESSURE, INSULIN, GLUCOSE, AND HOMOEOSTASIS MODEL ASSESSMENT-INSULIN RESISTANCE HAD SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED. SERUM ADIPONECTIN CONCENTRATIONS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE, HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL, DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE, AND HOMOEOSTASIS MODEL ASSESSMENT-INSULIN RESISTANCE IN THE POSTYOGA EXERCISE GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT YOGA EXERCISE IMPROVES ADIPONECTIN LEVEL, SERUM LIPIDS, AND METABOLIC SYNDROME RISK FACTORS IN OBESE POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. CONSEQUENTLY, YOGA EXERCISE WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE CAUSED BY OBESITY IN OBESE POSTMENOPAUSAL KOREAN WOMEN.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
12 2816 22 YOGA TRAINING IMPROVES METABOLIC PARAMETERS IN OBESE BOYS. YOGA HAS BEEN KNOWN TO HAVE STIMULATORY OR INHIBITORY EFFECTS ON THE METABOLIC PARAMETERS AND TO BE UNCOMPLICATED THERAPY FOR OBESITY. THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO TEST THE EFFECT OF AN 8-WEEK OF YOGA-ASANA TRAINING ON BODY COMPOSITION, LIPID PROFILE, AND INSULIN RESISTANCE (IR) IN OBESE ADOLESCENT BOYS. TWENTY VOLUNTEERS WITH BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) GREATER THAN THE 95TH PERCENTILE WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO YOGA (AGE 14.7+/-0.5 YEARS, N=10) AND CONTROL GROUPS (AGE 14.6+/-1.0 YEARS, N=10). THE YOGA GROUP PERFORMED EXERCISES THREE TIMES PER WEEK AT 40~60% OF HEART-RATE RESERVE (HRR) FOR 8 WEEKS. IR WAS DETERMINED WITH THE HOMEOSTASIS MODEL ASSESSMENT OF INSULIN RESISTANCE (HOMA-IR). AFTER YOGA TRAINING, BODY WEIGHT, BMI, FAT MASS (FM), AND BODY FAT % (BF %) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED, AND FAT-FREE MASS AND BASAL METABOLIC RATE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THAN BASELINE VALUES. FM AND BF % WERE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED IN THE YOGA GROUP COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP (P<0.05). TOTAL CHOLESTEROL (TC) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED IN THE YOGA GROUP (P<0.01). HDL-CHOLESTEROL WAS DECREASED IN BOTH GROUPS (P<0.05). NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE OBSERVED BETWEEN OR WITHIN GROUPS FOR TRIGLYCERIDES, LDL-CHOLESTEROL, GLUCOSE, INSULIN, AND HOMA-IR. OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT AN 8-WEEK OF YOGA TRAINING IMPROVES BODY COMPOSITION AND TC LEVELS IN OBESE ADOLESCENT BOYS, SUGGESTING THAT YOGA TRAINING MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN CONTROLLING SOME METABOLIC SYNDROME FACTORS IN OBESE ADOLESCENT BOYS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
13  324 19 ANTHROPOMETRIC, BIOCHEMICAL AND CLINICAL PARAMETERS IN CLIMACTERIC YOGA PRACTITIONERS. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE ANTHROPOMETRIC, BIOCHEMICAL AND CLINICAL PARAMETERS IN CLIMACTERIC YOGA PRACTITIONERS. METHODS: THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED 108 CLIMACTERIC WOMEN. WE RECRUITED 28 WOMEN BETWEEN 40 AND 65 YEARS OLD WHO STARTED YOGA PRACTICES IN PREMENOPAUSE AND HAD ALREADY PRACTICED FOR AT LEAST 5 YEARS. AS CONTROLS, WE SELECTED 30 PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (PA) PRACTITIONERS WHO HAD PRACTICED FOR AT LEAST 5 YEARS AND 50 SEDENTARY WOMEN IN THE SAME AGE RANGE. WE CONDUCED ANTHROPOMETRIC, BIOCHEMICAL AND BLOOD PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS. RESULTS: THE YOGA GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE THAN THE PA PRACTITIONERS AND SEDENTARY WOMEN. YOGA PRACTITIONERS ALSO HAD LOWER WEIGHT, BODY MASS INDEX, WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE, BODY FAT PERCENTAGE AND WAIST-TO-HEIGHT RATIO; HIGHER LEVELS OF HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL; LOWER LEVELS OF TRIGLYCERIDES, INSULIN, HOMEOSTASIS MODEL ASSESSMENT OF INSULIN RESISTANCE, URIC ACID, APOLIPOPROTEIN B AND HIGH-SENSITIVITY C-REACTIVE PROTEIN; AND LOWER FREQUENCY OF METABOLIC SYNDROME, LIPID ACCUMULATION PRODUCT, VISCERAL ADIPOSITY INDEX AND SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE THAN THE SEDENTARY WOMEN. CONCLUSION: YOGA PRACTITIONERS HAD LOWER GLUCOSE SERUM CONCENTRATIONS THAN THE PA PRACTITIONERS AND SEDENTARY WOMEN. OVERALL, THE YOGA GROUP ALSO HAD BETTER ANTHROPOMETRIC, BIOCHEMICAL AND CLINICAL VARIABLES THAN THE OTHER GROUPS. ALTHOUGH FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS REQUIRED, YOGA PRACTICE IN PREMENOPAUSE SEEMS TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR WOMEN WHEN THEY REACH MENOPAUSE.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
14  692 21 EFFECT OF COMMUNITY-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION ON OXIDATIVE STRESS AND GLYCEMIC PARAMETERS IN PREDIABETES: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: TO STUDY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON OXIDATIVE STRESS, GLYCEMIC STATUS, BLOOD PRESSURE AND ANTHROPOMETRY IN PREDIABETES. DESIGN: RANDOMIZED-CONTROLLED TRIAL. PARTICIPANTS: TWENTY NINE PREDIABETES SUBJECTS AGED 30-75 YEARS. SETTING: YOGA WAS CONDUCTED AT 4 DIFFERENT COMMUNITY DIABETES CLINICS IN MANGALORE, INDIA. INTERVENTIONS: PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER 3-MONTH YOGA OR WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUPS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: MALONDIALDEHYDE, GLUTATHIONE, VITAMIN C, VITAMIN E, SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE, PLASMA GLUCOSE, GLYCATED HAEMOGLOBIN, BMI, WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE, WAIST-TO-HIP RATIO AND BLOOD PRESSURE. RESULTS: YOGA INTERVENTION RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN MALONDIALDEHYDE (P<0.001), RELATIVE TO THE CONTROL GROUP. IN COMPARISON WITH THE CONTROL, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN BMI, WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE, SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND FASTING GLUCOSE LEVELS AT FOLLOW-UP. NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN GLYCATED HAEMOGLOBIN, WAIST-TO-HIP RATIO OR ANY OF THE ANTIOXIDANTS WAS OBSERVED. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA INTERVENTION MAY BE HELPFUL IN CONTROL OF OXIDATIVE STRESS IN PREDIABETES SUBJECTS. YOGA CAN ALSO BE BENEFICIAL IN REDUCTION IN BMI, WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE, SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND FASTING GLUCOSE. EFFECT OF YOGA ON ANTIOXIDANT PARAMETERS WAS NOT EVIDENT IN THIS STUDY. THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY NEED TO BE CONFIRMED IN LARGER TRIALS INVOLVING ACTIVE CONTROL GROUPS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
15  519 22 COMPARING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA & ORAL CALCIUM ADMINISTRATION IN ALLEVIATING SYMPTOMS OF PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME IN MEDICAL UNDERGRADUATES. INTRODUCTION: MEDICAL UNDERGRADUATES ARE HEAVILY BURDENED BY THEIR CURRICULUM. THE FEMALES, IN ADDITION, SUFFER FROM VIVID AFFECTIVE OR SOMATIC PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME (PMS) SYMPTOMS SUCH AS BLOATING, MASTALGIA, INSOMNIA, FATIGUE, MOOD SWINGS, IRRITABILITY, AND DEPRESSION. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS PROPOSED TO ATTENUATE THE SYMPTOMS OF PMS BY SIMPLE LIFESTYLE MEASURES LIKE YOGA AND/OR ORAL CALCIUM. METHODS: 65 MEDICAL FEMALE STUDENTS (18-22 YEARS) WITH A REGULAR MENSTRUAL CYCLE WERE ASKED TO SELF-RATE THEIR SYMPTOMS, ALONG WITH THEIR SEVERITY, IN A VALIDATED QUESTIONNAIRE FOR TWO CONSECUTIVE MENSTRUAL CYCLES. FIFTY-EIGHT STUDENTS WERE FOUND TO HAVE PMS. TWENTY GIRLS WERE GIVEN YOGA TRAINING (45 MINUTES DAILY, FIVE DAYS A WEEK, FOR THREE MONTHS). ANOTHER GROUP OF 20 WAS GIVEN ORAL TABLETS OF CALCIUM CARBONATE DAILY (500 MG, FOR THREE MONTHS) AND REST 18 GIRL SERVED AS CONTROL GROUP. DATA WERE ANALYZED BY SPSS VER.13 SOFTWARE. RESULTS: THE YOGA AND CALCIUM GROUPS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN NUMBER AND SEVERITY OF PREMENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS WHEREAS IN THE CONTROL GROUP THERE WAS NOT THE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE. CONCLUSION: ENCOURAGING A REGULAR PRACTICE OF YOGA OR TAKING A TABLET OF CALCIUM DAILY IN THE MEDICAL SCHOOLS CAN DECREASE THE SYMPTOMS OF PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
16  849 24 EFFECT OF YOGA ON SERUM HOMOCYSTEINE AND NITRIC OXIDE LEVELS IN ADOLESCENT WOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT DYSMENORRHEA. BACKGROUND: THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT STUDY IS TO EXPLORE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE SERUM LEVELS OF HOMOCYSTEINE AND NITRIC OXIDE (NO) IN A COHORT OF WOMEN WITH PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA AND NORMAL HEALTHY CONTROLS. METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED IN 35 WOMEN WITH PRIMARY DYSMENORRHEA AND 35 HEALTHY CONTROLS IN A COMMUNITY-BASED STUDY. SHORT-FORM MENSTRUAL DISTRESS QUESTIONNAIRES (MDQS) WERE ADMINISTERED TO ASSESS THE MENSTRUAL SYMPTOMS. ALL PARTICIPANTS WERE PROVIDED YOGA INTERVENTION, TWICE A WEEK AT 30 MINUTES/SESSION, CONSECUTIVELY FOR 8 WEEKS. BLOOD SAMPLES WERE DRAWN FROM EACH WOMAN ON THE THIRD DAY OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE. ASSESSMENTS OF MDQS AND BLOOD SAMPLES FOR THE DETERMINATION OF HOMOCYSTEINE AND NO CONCENTRATIONS WERE PERFORMED AT BASELINE AND WITHIN THE FIRST 3 DAYS OF THEIR NEXT MENSES AFTER COMPLETION OF YOGA INTERVENTION. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 30 WOMEN FROM THE DYSMENORRHEAL GROUP AND 30 FROM THE CONTROL GROUP COMPLETED THE STUDY. HOMOCYSTEINE LEVELS WERE HIGHER IN THOSE WITH DYSMENORRHEA WHEN COMPARED WITH HEALTHY CONTROLS BEFORE YOGA INTERVENTION (MANN-WHITNEY U TEST, P<0.05); HOWEVER, NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS AFTER 8 WEEKS OF YOGA TRAINING (P<0.05). THE CONCENTRATIONS OF HOMOCYSTEINE IN BOTH THE DYSMENORRHEAL AND CONTROL GROUPS AFTER 8 WEEKS DECREASED BY 51.37% AND 46.46%, RESPECTIVELY (P<0.001). THERE WERE NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN NO LEVELS BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS AT BASELINE AND AFTER INTERVENTION. THE TOTAL SCORES ON THE MDQS DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER YOGA INTERVENTION IN THE DYSMENORRHEAL GROUP (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: YOGA INTERVENTION WAS FOUND TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCTIONS IN SEVERITY OF DYSMENORRHEA AND MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN LOWERING SERUM HOMOCYSTEINE LEVELS AFTER AN INTERVENTION PERIOD OF 8 WEEKS. THESE OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY HAVE THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS IN WOMEN BY RESTORING ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
17 2737 23 YOGA POSITIVELY AFFECTED DEPRESSION AND BLOOD PRESSURE IN WOMEN WITH PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL. WOMEN WITH PREMENSTRUAL SYNDROME (PMS) OFTEN COMPLAIN ABOUT DEPRESSION WHEN THEIR MENSTRUAL CYCLE BEGINS. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON WOMEN WITH PMS SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION DURING MENSTRUAL CYCLE. METHODS: THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED FROM APRIL TO OCTOBER 2015 IN TABRIZ, IRAN. ALL SUBJECTS (20-45 YEARS OLD), WHO WERE FREQUENTLY REFERRED TO THE PRIVATE OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY CLINICS, WERE INITIALLY MONITORED FOR PMS AND DEPRESSION. SUBJECTS COMPLETED THE DEMOGRAPHIC AND BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY-II (BDI-II) QUESTIONNAIRES BEFORE AND AFTER INTERVENTION. IN ADDITION, SUBJECTS WERE MONITORED FOR ELIGIBLE AND INELIGIBLE CRITERIA. IN THIS STUDY 62 SUBJECTS WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED FOR THE YOGA GROUP AND CONTROL GROUPS. SUBJECTS PRACTICED YOGA OVER TWO MONTHS IN THREE SESSIONS, THE DURATION OF EACH SESSION WAS 60MIN. RESULTS: THE GENERAL SCORE OF THE DEPRESSION AFTER YOGA INTERVENTION WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP (P<0.036) AND YOGA GROUP BEFORE INTERVENTION (P<0.001). THE DIASTOLIC PRESSURE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER YOGA INTERVENTION (P<0.029). YOGA DECREASED THE STATE OF DEPRESSION AND DIASTOLIC PRESSURE OF THE SUBJECTS WITH PMS COMPLAINING FROM DEPRESSION. CONCLUSION: WE CONCLUDE THAT YOGA HAS STRONG EFFECTS ON DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AND BLOOD PRESSURE, THEREFORE IT CAN BE USED AS A COMPLEMENTARY OR ALTERNATIVE REMEDY FOR PMS PATIENTS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
18  449 12 CHANGES IN CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS AND HORMONES DURING A COMPREHENSIVE RESIDENTIAL THREE MONTH KRIYA YOGA TRAINING AND VEGETARIAN NUTRITION. IN PARTICIPANTS OF A COMPREHENSIVE RESIDENTIAL THREE MONTH YOGA AND MEDIATION TRAINING PROGRAMME LIVING ON A LOW FAT LACTO-VEGETARIAN DIET CHANGES IN CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS AND HORMONES WERE STUDIED. SUBSTANTIAL RISK FACTOR REDUCTION WAS FOUND. BODY MASS INDEX, TOTAL SERUM AND LDL CHOLESTEROL, FIBRINOGEN, AND BLOOD PRESSURE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED ESPECIALLY IN THOSE WITH ELEVATED LEVELS. URINARY EXCRETION OF ADRENALINE, NORADRENALINE, DOPAMINE, ALDOSTERONE, AS WELL AS SERUM TESTOSTERONE AND LUTEINIZING HORMONE LEVELS WERE REDUCED, WHILE CORTISOL EXCRETION INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY.	1997	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
19 1860 26 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF A 12-WEEK YOGA-BASED (INCLUDING DIET) LIFESTYLE VS. DIETARY INTERVENTION ON CARDIO-METABOLIC RISK FACTORS AND CONTINUOUS RISK SCORE IN INDIAN ADULTS WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME. METABOLIC SYNDROME, A PREDIABETIC AND PRECARDIOVASCULAR PATHOLOGIC CONDITION THAT BEGINS EARLY IN LIFE, TRACKS INTO ADULTHOOD AND MAGNIFIES WITH AGE. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS EVALUATING EFFICACY OF YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE VS. DIETARY INTERVENTION ON METABOLIC SYNDROME ARE LACKING. HERE, THE EFFICACY OF A 12-WEEK YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION VS. DIETARY INTERVENTION ON CARDIO-METABOLIC RISK FACTORS AND METABOLIC SYNDROME RISK SCORES HAVE BEEN ASSESSED IN INDIAN ADULTS WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME. IN THIS TWO-ARM, OPEN LABEL, PARALLEL GROUP, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, 260 ADULTS (20-45 YEARS) DIAGNOSED WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME AS PER JOINT INTERIM STATEMENT, 2009 WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA-BASED (INCLUDING DIET) LIFESTYLE OR DIETARY INTERVENTION ALONE (N = 130, EACH) FOR 12 WEEKS. PRIMARY ENDPOINTS WERE THE 12-WEEK CHANGES IN CARDIO-METABOLIC RISK FACTORS AND METABOLIC RISK SCORES. THE SECONDARY ENDPOINTS WERE THE 12-WEEK CHANGES IN THE PROPORTION OF SUBJECTS RECOVERED FROM METABOLIC SYNDROME, DIETARY INTAKE, AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. INTENT-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED INCLUDING ALL THE SUBJECTS WITH BASELINE DATA WITH IMPUTED MISSING DATA. TREATMENT X TIME INTERACTION SHOWED YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION HAD A GREATER TREATMENT EFFECT OVER DIETARY INTERVENTION BY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCING WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE, CONTINUOUS METABOLIC SYNDROME Z-SCORE, AND DIETARY INTAKE/DAY WHILE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL SHOWED A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER REDUCTION FOLLOWING DIETARY INTERVENTION THAN YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION. A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER PROPORTION OF SUBJECTS RECOVERED FROM METABOLIC SYNDROME IN YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE (45.4%) VS. DIETARY INTERVENTION GROUP (32.3%). A 12-WEEK YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION IS MORE EFFICACIOUS THAN USUAL DIETARY INTERVENTION IN IMPROVING CARDIO-METABOLIC RISK FACTOR AND METABOLIC RISK SCORE IN INDIAN ADULTS WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME.	2020	
                                                                                                                                     
20   50 17 A COMPARATIVE CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND WALKING FOR OVERWEIGHT AND OBESE ADULTS. BACKGROUND: WALKING AND YOGA HAVE BEEN INDEPENDENTLY EVALUATED FOR WEIGHT CONTROL; HOWEVER, THERE ARE VERY FEW STUDIES COMPARING THE 2 WITH RANDOMIZATION. MATERIAL AND METHODS: THE PRESENT STUDY COMPARED THE EFFECTS OF 90 MINUTES/DAY FOR 15 DAYS OF SUPERVISED YOGA OR SUPERVISED WALKING ON: (I) RELATED BIOCHEMISTRY, (II) ANTHROPOMETRIC VARIABLES, (III) BODY COMPOSITION, (IV) POSTURAL STABILITY, AND (V) BILATERAL HAND GRIP STRENGTH IN OVERWEIGHT AND OBESE PERSONS. SIXTY-EIGHT PARTICIPANTS, OF WHOM 5 WERE OVERWEIGHT (BMI >/=25 KG/M2) AND 63 WERE OBESE (BMI >/=30 KG/M2; GROUP MEAN AGE +/-S.D., 36.4+/-11.2 YEARS; 35 FEMALES), WERE RANDOMIZED AS 2 GROUPS - (I) A YOGA GROUP AND (II) A WALKING GROUP - GIVEN THE SAME DIET. RESULTS: ALL DIFFERENCES WERE PRE-POST CHANGES WITHIN EACH GROUP. BOTH GROUPS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT (P<0.05; REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA, POST-HOC ANALYSES) DECREASE IN: BMI, WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE, HIP CIRCUMFERENCE, LEAN MASS, BODY WATER, AND TOTAL CHOLESTEROL. THE YOGA GROUP INCREASED SERUM LEPTIN (P<0.01) AND DECREASED LDL CHOLESTEROL (P<0.05). THE WALKING GROUP DECREASED SERUM ADIPONECTIN (P<0.05) AND TRIGLYCERIDES (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: BOTH YOGA AND WALKING IMPROVED ANTHROPOMETRIC VARIABLES AND SERUM LIPID PROFILE IN OVERWEIGHT AND OBESE PERSONS. THE POSSIBLE IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED.	2014

1  886 79 EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON THE TINNITUS INDUCED DISTRESS. THE STUDY ADDRESSED THE EFFICACY OF 12 WEEKS OF YOGA TRAINING IN TREATING 25 PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC TINNITUS. TEN OF THE PATIENTS UNDERWENT MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI) BEFORE AND AFTER TRAINING. A CONTROL GROUP COMPRISED 13 PEOPLE REPORTING CHRONIC TINNITUS. ALL PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSESSED WITH THE TINNITUS FUNCTIONAL INDEX. AFTER THE 12-WEEK YOGA COURSE, THE AREAS CONSIDERED TO HAVE BENEFITED MOST WERE THE SENSE OF CONTROL OF TINNITUS, SLEEP, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND INTRUSIVENESS. THE MRI STUDIES INDICATED THAT CONNECTIONS IN THE WHITE MATTER OF THE MOTOR CORTEX APPEARED TO BE STRONGER AS A RESULT OF TRAINING. YOGA TRAINING HAS GOOD POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE DAILY FUNCTIONING OF PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC TINNITUS AND CAN BE CONSIDERED A PROMISING SUPPORTING METHOD FOR TINNITUS TREATMENT.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
2 2168 25 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM SUBJECTIVE TINNITUS. INTRODUCTION TINNITUS IS A PERCEPTION OF SOUND IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EXTERNAL SOURCE AND IT IS A DISTRESSING ISSUE. YOGA IS A SYSTEM OF MIND-BODY PRACTICES WITH THE GOAL OF UNITING THE BODY, MIND AND SOUL. IT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE ANXIETY AND STRESS, AS WELL AS IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE. OBJECTIVE THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM CHRONIC SUBJECTIVE TINNITUS. METHODS TWELVE SUBJECTS PREVIOUSLY DIAGNOSED WITH CHRONIC SUBJECTIVE TINNITUS WERE SELECTED FOR THE STUDY. THE PATIENTS WERE ASKED TO ATTEND TO YOGA CLASSES ONCE A WEEK AND TO PRACTICE YOGA AT HOME USING A WORKSHEET FOR 3 MONTHS. EACH YOGA CLASS CONSISTED OF BODY EXERCISES (ASANA), BREATHING (PRANAYAMA) AND MEDITATION (SHAVASANA AND YOGA NIDRA). TINNITUS SCORES BEFORE AND AFTER THE YOGA CLASSES WERE COMPARED USING THE WILCOXON TEST. RESULTS AMONG THE 12 PATIENTS, THERE WERE 4 MEN AND 8 WOMEN AND THEIR MEAN AGE WAS 52.5 YEARS. THE MEDIAN DURATION OF TINNITUS AMONG THE GROUP WAS 5.4 YEARS. THERE WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE STRESS ( P = 0.01), HANDICAP ( P = 0.004) AND SEVERITY ( P = 0.007) QUESTIONNAIRES SCORES. CONCLUSION THIS STUDY INDICATED THAT YOGA PRACTICES MAY REDUCE LIFE STRESS AND SYMPTOMS OF SUBJECTIVE TINNITUS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
3  773 21 EFFECT OF YOGA AND MEDITATION ON TINNITUS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVE: THE PRESENT SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AIMED TO EXPLORE THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE ON THE APPLICATION OF YOGA AND MEDITATION FOR TINNITUS. METHOD: A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH WAS CARRIED OUT TO IDENTIFY THE ELIGIBLE STUDIES EXPLORING THE EFFECT OF YOGA AND MEDITATION ON TINNITUS IN PUBMED, SCOPUS AND COCHRANE LIBRARY ELECTRONIC DATABASES. STUDIES ON THE APPLICATION OF YOGA AND MEDITATION ON TINNITUS WERE IDENTIFIED FOLLOWING A THREE-STEP SCREENING PROCESS BY BOTH THE AUTHORS INDEPENDENTLY. A MIXED-METHODS APPRAISAL TOOL WAS USED TO PERFORM THE QUALITY APPRAISAL OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES. RESULTS: FIVE STUDIES WERE SHORTLISTED AND INCLUDED IN THE PRESENT REVIEW. FOUR STUDIES HAD USED DIFFERENT TYPES OF YOGA AND PRANAYAMA, WHILE ONE USED RELAXATION THERAPY. THREE STUDIES CONCLUDED THAT THERE WERE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON TINNITUS, SUCH AS A REDUCTION IN SEVERITY, STRESS, ANXIETY AND IRRITABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH TINNITUS AND IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE. CONCLUSION: THIS REVIEW HIGHLIGHTS THE APPLICATION OF YOGA AND MEDITATION IN MANAGEMENT OF TINNITUS ALONG WITH REGULAR OTOLOGICAL AND AUDIOLOGICAL TREATMENT OPTIONS. FURTHERMORE, THERE IS A NEED TO HAVE MORE RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS IN THIS AREA TO EVIDENCE THE EFFECT OF YOGA AND MEDITATION ON TINNITUS EMPIRICALLY.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
4 2251 21 THE MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC TINNITUS--COMPARISON OF A COGNITIVE-BEHAVIOURAL GROUP TRAINING WITH YOGA. TWO NON-MEDICAL TREATMENT STRATEGIES FOR CHRONIC IDIOPATHIC TINNITUS WERE EVALUATED IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROL GROUP DESIGN. A COGNITIVE-BEHAVIOURAL TINNITUS COPING TRAINING (TCT) WAS DEVELOPED AND COMPARED TO YOGA AND A SELF-MONITORING CONTROL CONDITION. FORTY-THREE CHRONIC TINNITUS PATIENTS, WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE, DIRECTLY AFTER THERAPY, AND AT 3 MONTHS FOLLOW-UP. FOR EVALUATION, DIFFERENTIAL PSYCHOACOUSTIC VARIABLES WERE REGISTERED, A TINNITUS DIARY AS WELL AS THE TINNITUS QUESTIONNAIRE AND DIFFERENT MEASURES OF GENERAL WELL-BEING WERE USED. STATISTICAL ANALYSES SHOWED EFFECTS FAVOURING THE TCT TREATMENT IN COMPARISON TO THE CONTROL AND YOGA TREATMENT. THE TCT-TREATED PATIENTS REPORTED MORE SATISFACTION WITH THE TRAINING THAN THE YOGA GROUP. PARTICIPANTS IN THE SELF-MONITORING CONTROL GROUP WERE TREATED EITHER BY TCT OR YOGA AFTER A WAITING PERIOD. THE OUTCOME IN THIS GROUP WAS EVEN BETTER THAN IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS WHILE YOGA AGAIN SHOWED RATHER POOR EFFECTS.	1995	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
5 1512 18 IS THERE MORE TO YOGA THAN EXERCISE? CONTEXT: YOGA IS INCREASING IN POPULARITY, WITH AN ESTIMATED 15 MILLION PRACTITIONERS IN THE UNITED STATES, YET THERE IS A DEARTH OF EMPIRICAL DATA ADDRESSING THE HOLISTIC BENEFITS OF YOGA. OBJECTIVE: TO COMPARE THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL BENEFITS OF AN EXERCISE-BASED YOGA PRACTICE TO THAT OF A MORE COMPREHENSIVE YOGA PRACTICE (ONE WITH AN ETHICAL/SPIRITUAL COMPONENT). DESIGN: STUDENTS WITH MILD TO MODERATE DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, OR STRESS AND WHO AGREED TO PARTICIPATE WERE ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THREE GROUPS: INTEGRATED YOGA, YOGA AS EXERCISE, CONTROL. PARTICIPANTS: A TOTAL OF 81 UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS 18 YEARS AND OLDER AT A UNIVERSITY IN THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, STRESS, HOPE, AND SALIVARY CORTISOL. RESULTS: OVER TIME, PARTICIPANTS IN BOTH THE INTEGRATED AND EXERCISE YOGA GROUPS EXPERIENCED DECREASED DEPRESSION AND STRESS, AN INCREASED SENSE OF HOPEFULNESS, AND INCREASED FLEXIBILITY COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. HOWEVER, ONLY THE INTEGRATED YOGA GROUP EXPERIENCED DECREASED ANXIETY-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND DECREASED SALIVARY CORTISOL FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END OF THE STUDY. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA, PRACTICED IN A MORE INTEGRATED FORM, IE, WITH AN ETHICAL AND SPIRITUAL COMPONENT, MAY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS OVER YOGA PRACTICED AS AN EXERCISE REGIMEN.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
6 2235 24 THE IMPACT OF YOGA UPON FEMALE PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM HYPOTHYROIDISM. OBJECTIVE: TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF FEMALE HYPOTHYROID PATIENTS. DESIGN: THE WHO QUALITY OF LIFE SCALE(22) WAS USED TO ASSESS THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF 20 FEMALE HYPOTHYROID PATIENTS. SUBJECTS ATTENDED ONE HOUR YOGA SESSIONS DAILY FOR A PERIOD OF ONE MONTH. A PRETEST-POST-TEST RESEARCH DESIGN WAS USED FOR DATA ANALYSIS. RESULTS: PATIENTS' QUALITY OF LIFE SCORES FOLLOWING THE YOGA PROGRAM WERE GREATER THAN SCORES OBTAINED PRIOR TO UNDERTAKING YOGA (P < 0.01). PATIENTS ALSO REPORTED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR PERCEPTION OF THE OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE AND OF THEIR HEALTH POST YOGA INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT YOGA IS VALUABLE IN HELPING THE HYPOTHYROID PATIENTS TO MANAGE THEIR DISEASE-RELATED SYMPTOMS. YOGA MAY BE CONSIDERED AS SUPPORTIVE OR COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY IN CONJUNCTION WITH MEDICAL THERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF HYPOTHYROID DISORDER.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
7 1424 22 IMPROVEMENT IN PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS AFTER 6 MONTHS OF YOGA PRACTICE. YOGA IS BELIEVED TO HAVE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON COGNITION, ATTENUATION OF EMOTIONAL INTENSITY AND STRESS REDUCTION. PREVIOUS STUDIES WERE MAINLY PERFORMED ON EASTERN EXPERIENCED PRACTITIONERS OR UNHEALTHY SUBJECTS UNDERGOING CONCOMITANT CONVENTIONAL THERAPIES. FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS NEEDED ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA PER SE, AS WELL AS ITS POSSIBLE PREVENTIVE BENEFITS ON HEALTHY SUBJECTS. WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON MEMORY AND PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS RELATED TO STRESS, COMPARING YOGA PRACTICE AND CONVENTIONAL PHYSICAL EXERCISES IN HEALTHY MEN (PREVIOUSLY YOGA-NAIVE). MEMORY TESTS, SALIVARY CORTISOL LEVELS AND STRESS, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION INVENTORIES WERE ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER 6 MONTHS OF PRACTICE. YOGA PRACTITIONERS SHOWED IMPROVEMENT OF THE MEMORY PERFORMANCE, AS WELL AS IMPROVEMENTS IN PSYCHOPHYSIOLOGICAL PARAMETERS. THE PRESENT RESULTS SUGGEST THAT REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE CAN IMPROVE ASPECTS OF COGNITION AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS. AN INDIRECT INFLUENCE OF EMOTIONAL STATE ON COGNITIVE IMPROVEMENT PROMOTED BY YOGA PRACTICE CAN BE PROPOSED.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
8 2871 22 YOGA-BASED RELAXATION TECHNIQUE FACILITATES SUSTAINED ATTENTION IN PATIENTS WITH LOW BACK PAIN: A PILOT STUDY. CONTEXT: THE EXPERIENCE OF PAIN STRONGLY INFLUENCES SUSTAINED ATTENTION, WHICH IS IMPORTANT FOR NEUROCOGNITIVE PERFORMANCE. YOGA-BASED RELAXATION TECHNIQUES MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING SUSTAINED ATTENTION BY ATTENUATING PAIN IN PATIENTS WITH LOW BACK PAIN. HENCE, WE AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF A YOGA-BASED RELAXATION TECHNIQUE ON SUSTAINED ATTENTION AND SELF-REPORTED PAIN DISABILITY IN PATIENTS WITH LOW BACK PAIN. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 22 MEN AGED 30 TO 50 YEARS WITH LOW BACK PAIN WERE RECRUITED FOR THE STUDY. THEY WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER THE YOGA (N = 11) OR CONTROL (N = 11) GROUPS. THE YOGA GROUP PRACTICED A YOGA-BASED RELAXATION TECHNIQUE (YBRT) 1 HOUR A DAY FOR 4 WEEKS AND THE CONTROL GROUP MAINTAINED THEIR USUAL PHYSICAL ACTIVITY REGIMEN. ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED THE SUSTAINED ATTENTION TO RESPONSE TASK (SART) AND THE OSWESTRY LOW BACK PAIN DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE (OLBPDQ) MEASURED BEFORE AND AFTER THE 4-WEEK INTERVENTION. RESULTS: THE STUDY SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN ALL SELF-REPORTED OLBPDQ DOMAINS AND IMPROVEMENT IN SUSTAINED ATTENTION IN A BEFORE AND AFTER COMPARISON 4 WEEKS FOLLOWING THE YOGA INTERVENTION. PEARSON'S CORRELATION ALSO SHOWED A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN SUSTAINED ATTENTION AND PAIN REDUCTION FOLLOWING THE YOGA INTERVENTION. CONCLUSION: THE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT YOGA PRACTICE REDUCES PAIN AND SIMULTANEOUSLY IMPROVES INFORMATION PROCESSING SPEED WITH IMPULSE CONTROL DURING THE PERFORMANCE OF A SUSTAINED ATTENTION TASK.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
9 2102 26 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON COPING STRATEGIES AMONG INTENSIVE CARE UNIT NURSES. INTRODUCTION: NOWADAYS, IT HAS BEEN KNOWN THAT INDIVIDUALS HANDLE COPING STRATEGIES WHEN FACED WITH STRESSFUL EVENTS. THESE STRATEGIES PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN INDIVIDUALS. NURSES ARE EXPOSED TO HIGH STRESS, WHICH DIRECTLY AFFECTS THEIR JOB SATISFACTION AND THE QUALITY OF THEIR SERVICES. THEREFORE, THE PRESENT STUDY TRIED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON STRESS COPING STRATEGIES AMONG NURSES WORKING IN INTENSIVE CARE UNITS (ICUS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: IN THIS QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY, 34 FEMALE NURSES WORKING IN ICU WHO WERE QUALIFIED TO ENTER THE STUDY WERE SELECTED. YOGA EXERCISES WERE ADMINISTRATED TWO SESSIONS A WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS IN THE STUDY GROUP. CS-R QUESTIONNAIRE WAS FILLED BEFORE AND AFTER INTERVENTION. THE DATA WERE ANALYZED BY DESCRIPTIVE AND INFERENTIAL (T TEST) STATISTICAL TESTS. RESULTS: THE RESULTS OF STATISTICAL TESTS SHOWED THAT THE HIGHEST APPLICATION OF STRESS COPING STRATEGIES WAS FOR INCONSISTENT STRESS COPING STRATEGY. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE MEAN SCORES OF COPING STRATEGIES OF STRESS FOCUS, EMOTION FOCUS, AND INEFFECTIVENESS AFTER YOGA EXERCISES COMPARED WITH THOSE BEFORE THE YOGA SESSIONS. DISCUSSION: WITH REGARD TO THE FINDINGS, 8 WEEKS EXERCISES OF YOGA CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT TO AMEND STRESS COPING STRATEGIES. FURTHER STUDIES IN THIS FIELD ARE SUGGESTED.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
10  208 21 A SINGLE SESSION OF AN INTEGRATED YOGA PROGRAM AS A STRESS MANAGEMENT TOOL FOR SCHOOL EMPLOYEES: COMPARISON OF DAILY PRACTICE AND NONDAILY PRACTICE OF A YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM. OBJECTIVES: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF THE DAILY PRACTICE OF A YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM LEARNT DURING A SINGLE SESSION OF AN INTEGRATED YOGA INTERVENTION THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY US AS A STRESS MANAGEMENT TOOL FOR SCHOOL EMPLOYEES. SUBJECTS: NINETY SCHOOL EMPLOYEES. DESIGN: CASE-CONTROL STUDY. THREE MONTHS AFTER THE INTERVENTION, THE SUBJECTS WERE ASSIGNED TO A DAILY PRACTICE GROUP (CASE: N=43) AND A NONCONSECUTIVE DAILY PRACTICE GROUP (CONTROL: N=47) ACCORDING TO THEIR DAILY PRACTICE LEVEL OF THE YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM. INTERVENTIONS: THE SUBJECTS PARTICIPATED IN A STRESS MANAGEMENT EDUCATION PROGRAM BASED ON AN INTEGRATED YOGA THERAPY SESSION. THE PROGRAM INCLUDED PSYCHOLOGICAL EDUCATION AND COUNSELING ABOUT STRESS MANAGEMENT AND YOGA THEORIES, AS WELL AS THE PRACTICES OF ASANAS, PRANAYAMA, RELAXATION, AND COGNITIVE STRUCTURE BASED ON INDIAN PHILOSOPHY. OUTCOME MEASURES: ASSESSMENTS WERE PERFORMED BEFORE AND AFTER THE PROGRAM USING THE SUBJECTIVE UNITS OF DISTRESS FOR MIND AND BODY AND THE TWO-DIMENSIONAL MOOD SCALE. THE GENERAL HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE 28 (GHQ28) WAS USED TO ASSESS THE MENTAL HEALTH STATE BEFORE THE INTERVENTION AND AT 3 MONTHS AFTER THE PROGRAM. RESULTS: THE SUBJECTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THEIR LEVELS OF CALMNESS, COMFORT, AND CHEERFULNESS (P<0.001) AND SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN COGNITIVE MIND AND BODY STRESS (P<0.001) AFTER PARTICIPATING IN THE INTEGRATED YOGA PROGRAM. A COMPARISON OF THE TOTAL SCORES ON THE GHQ28 USING A TWO-WAY ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS IN TERMS OF BOTH INTERACTION (P=0.047) AND THE MAIN EFFECT (P=0.026). CONCLUSIONS: THE PRESENT RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT A SINGLE SESSION OF AN INTEGRATED YOGA PROGRAM WAS EFFECTIVE FOR REDUCING STRESS AND THAT THE MENTAL HEALTH OF SCHOOL EMPLOYEES WAS PROMOTED BY THE DAILY PRACTICE OF THE YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM.	2015	

11 2215 22 THE IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF MODIFIED YOGA POSITIONS ON MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN RELIEF. MANY MUSCULOSKELETAL PAINS ARE RELATED TO POOR POSTURE. THUS, THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFICIENCY OF A SINGLE SESSION OF TWO MODIFIED YOGA POSITIONS WITH 110 SUBJECTS AND THEIR 147 PAIN-RELATED COMPLAINTS. THE PARTICIPANTS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: THE YOGA GROUP, WHICH RECEIVED TREATMENT OF TWO 20-MIN POSTURES AND THE CONTROL GROUP, WHICH RECEIVED A PLACEBO TREATMENT OF 15 MIN WITH A TURNED OFF ULTRASOUND. ALL VOLUNTEERS EXPERIENCED SOME PAIN BEFORE TREATMENT AND WERE ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER TREATMENT USING THE ANALOG PAIN SCALE. A SCORE OF 0 INDICATED NO PAIN WHEREAS 10 WAS THE MAXIMUM DEGREE OF PAIN ON THE SCALE. THE DIFFERENCE BEFORE AND AFTER TREATMENT WAS COMPARED BETWEEN THE GROUPS WITH A P-VALUE OF 0.0001, AS MEASURED BY THE STUDENT'S T-TEST. IT IS POSSIBLE TO CONCLUDE THAT ONE THERAPY SESSION IS EFFECTIVE IN THE TREATMENT OF VARIOUS MUSCULOSKELETAL PROBLEMS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
12  248 24 A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR YOUNG ADULTS WITH ELEVATED SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION. CONTEXT: YOGA TEACHERS AND STUDENTS OFTEN REPORT THAT YOGA HAS AN UPLIFTING EFFECT ON THEIR MOODS, BUT SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH ON YOGA AND DEPRESSION IS LIMITED. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF A SHORT-TERM IYENGAR YOGA COURSE ON MOOD IN MILDLY DEPRESSED YOUNG ADULTS. DESIGN: YOUNG ADULTS PRE-SCREENED FOR MILD LEVELS OF DEPRESSION WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A YOGA COURSE OR WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP. SETTING: COLLEGE CAMPUS RECREATION CENTER. PARTICIPANTS: TWENTY-EIGHT VOLUNTEERS AGES 18 TO 29. AT INTAKE, ALL PARTICIPANTS WERE EXPERIENCING MILD LEVELS OF DEPRESSION, BUT HAD RECEIVED NO CURRENT PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSES OR TREATMENTS. NONE HAD SIGNIFICANT YOGA EXPERIENCE. INTERVENTION: SUBJECTS IN THE YOGA GROUP ATTENDED TWO 1-HOUR IYENGAR YOGA CLASSES EACH WEEK FOR 5 CONSECUTIVE WEEKS. THE CLASSES EMPHASIZED YOGA POSTURES THOUGHT TO ALLEVIATE DEPRESSION, PARTICULARLY BACK BENDS, STANDING POSES, AND INVERSIONS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY, STATE-TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY, PROFILE OF MOOD STATES, MORNING CORTISOL LEVELS. RESULTS: SUBJECTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE YOGA COURSE DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN SELF-REPORTED SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION AND TRAIT ANXIETY. THESE EFFECTS EMERGED BY THE MIDDLE OF THE YOGA COURSE AND WERE MAINTAINED BY THE END. CHANGES ALSO WERE OBSERVED IN ACUTE MOOD, WITH SUBJECTS REPORTING DECREASED LEVELS OF NEGATIVE MOOD AND FATIGUE FOLLOWING YOGA CLASSES. FINALLY, THERE WAS A TREND FOR HIGHER MORNING CORTISOL LEVELS IN THE YOGA GROUP BY THE END OF THE YOGA COURSE, COMPARED TO CONTROLS. THESE FINDINGS PROVIDE SUGGESTIVE EVIDENCE OF THE UTILITY OF YOGA ASANAS IN IMPROVING MOOD AND SUPPORT THE NEED FOR FUTURE STUDIES WITH LARGER SAMPLES AND MORE COMPLEX STUDY DESIGNS TO MORE FULLY EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON MOOD DISTURBANCES.	2004	
                                                                                                                                                                                     
13 1701 25 PARTICIPATION IN A YOGA STUDY DECREASES STRESS AND DEPRESSION SCORES FOR INCARCERATED WOMEN. INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS EXHIBIT A HIGH INCIDENCE OF STRESS-RELATED DISORDERS, INCLUDING ADDICTION AND POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD), AS WELL AS THE ADDED STRESS OF CAPTIVITY. ACCESS TO STRESS-REDUCTION TOOLS IS LIMITED FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS. ONE POSSIBLE APPROACH MAY BE REGULAR STRUCTURED YOGA CLASSES. USING TWO APPROACHES, WE TESTED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A BRIEF, INTENSIVE YOGA INTERVENTION IN A POPULATION OF INCARCERATED WOMEN IN A COUNTY JAIL. THE FIRST APPROACH WAS AN EXAMINATION OF ARCHIVAL DATA COLLECTED AS PART OF A PROGRAM ANALYSIS. INDIVIDUALS SHOWED CONSIDERABLE REDUCTION IN SELF-REPORTED STRESS FOLLOWING A SINGLE YOGA SESSION. THE SECOND APPROACH WAS AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY USING A WEEK-LONG YOGA INTERVENTION. THIRTY-FOUR PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSIGNED TO EITHER THE YOGA OR CONTROL GROUP FOR THE FIRST WEEK. IN THE SECOND WEEK, THE CONDITIONS WERE REVERSED. PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSESSED WEEKLY, BEFORE AND AFTER INTERVENTION. BASELINE SCORES REVEALED HIGH RATES OF DEPRESSION, STRESS, AND EXPOSURE TO TRAUMATIC LIFE EVENTS COMPARED TO NORMATIVE DATA. STRESS AND DEPRESSION WERE ASSESSED USING THE PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE AND BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY, RESPECTIVELY. COMPARED TO CONTROLS, PARTICIPANTS REPORTED LESS DEPRESSION AFTER A WEEK OF DAILY YOGA SESSIONS. PERCEIVED STRESS DECLINED UNDER BOTH CONTROL AND YOGA CONDITIONS. DUE TO THE TRANSIENT NATURE OF THE JAIL INSTITUTION, IT IS IMPORTANT TO EXAMINE INTERVENTIONS THAT CAN BE PROVIDED ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS. ALTHOUGH THERE WERE LIMITATIONS IN THIS STUDY, THE RESULTS SUPPORT THE CONCLUSION THAT THE BRIEF YOGA INTERVENTION HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON PARTICIPANTS' WELL-BEING.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
14 2459 26 YOGA AS A HOLISTIC APPROACH FOR STRESS MANAGEMENT IN ORAL CANCER PATIENTS. A PROSPECTIVE STUDY. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: ORAL CANCER HAS BEEN RANKED AS THE SIXTH MOST COMMON CANCER GLOBALLY. IT HAS BEEN REPORTED TO BE INCREASING IN INCIDENCE ESPECIALLY, IN THE SOUTHERN PARTS OF ASIA WHICH CHIEFLY INCLUDES, INDIA. DIAGNOSIS OF ORAL CANCER IS FOLLOWED BY A VIGOROUS AND HIGHLY MORBID TREATMENT PROTOCOL WHICH DRASTICALLY IMPACTS THE PATIENT'S QUALITY OF LIFE. THIS IN TURN CAN CAUSE EXTREME STRESS IN A PERSON. THIS STUDY AIMED TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF THE PRACTICE OF YOGA ON STRESS LEVELS IN CANCER PATIENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 200 SUBJECTS DIAGNOSED WITH ORAL CANCER WERE SELECTED FOR THIS STUDY. THEIR STRESS LEVELS WERE SCORED BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER INITIATING THE PRACTICE OF YOGIC EXERCISES IN A ONE-MONTH INTERVAL USING A QUESTIONNAIRE. OBTAINED SCORES WERE ENTERED IN MICROSOFT EXCEL 2007 WORKSHEET AND AN UNPAIRED T-TEST WAS APPLIED. P VALUES OF LESS THAN 0.05 AND 0.001 WERE CONSIDERED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AND EXTREMELY SIGNIFICANT, RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS: STUDY RESULTS SHOWED A REDUCTION IN STRESS LEVEL SCORES (48 +/- 0.99 TO 37 +/- 5.2) AFTER ADOPTING YOGA FOR ONE MONTH. AN EXTREMELY SIGNIFICANT P VALUE OF LESS THAN 0.001 WAS OBTAINED. CONCLUSION: IT CAN BE CONCLUDED FROM THIS STUDY THAT YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE METHOD IN REDUCING STRESS LEVELS IN INDIVIDUALS DIAGNOSED WITH ORAL CANCER.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
15 1700 29 PARTICIPATION IN A 10-WEEK COURSE OF YOGA IMPROVES BEHAVIOURAL CONTROL AND DECREASES PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS IN A PRISON POPULATION. BACKGROUND: YOGA AND MEDITATION HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN ALLEVIATING SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY IN HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS AND PSYCHIATRIC POPULATIONS. RECENT WORK HAS ALSO INDICATED THAT YOGA CAN IMPROVE COGNITIVE-BEHAVIOURAL PERFORMANCE AND CONTROL. ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN NO CONTROLLED STUDIES OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN A PRISON POPULATION, WE REASONED THAT YOGA COULD HAVE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS IN A SETTING WHERE PSYCHOSOCIAL FUNCTIONING IS OFTEN LOW, AND THE FREQUENCY OF IMPULSIVE BEHAVIOURS IS HIGH. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED FROM 7 BRITISH PRISONS AND RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO EITHER A 10-WEEK YOGA PROGRAMME (YOGA GROUP; 1 CLASS PER WEEK; N = 45) OR A CONTROL GROUP (N = 55). SELF-REPORT MEASURES OF MOOD, STRESS, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS WERE COLLECTED BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION PERIOD. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED A COGNITIVE-BEHAVIOURAL TASK (GO/NO-GO) AT THE END OF THE STUDY, WHICH ASSESSED BEHAVIOURAL RESPONSE INHIBITION AND SUSTAINED ATTENTION. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED INCREASED SELF-REPORTED POSITIVE AFFECT, AND REDUCED STRESS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, COMPARED TO PARTICIPANTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP. PARTICIPANTS WHO COMPLETED THE YOGA COURSE ALSO SHOWED BETTER PERFORMANCE IN THE COGNITIVE-BEHAVIOURAL TASK, MAKING SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER ERRORS OF OMISSION IN GO TRIALS AND FEWER ERRORS OF COMMISSION ON NO-GO TRIALS, COMPARED TO CONTROL PARTICIPANTS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING SUBJECTIVE WELLBEING, MENTAL HEALTH, AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING WITHIN PRISON POPULATIONS. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION GIVEN THE CONSISTENTLY HIGH RATES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MORBIDITY IN THIS GROUP AND THE NEED FOR EFFECTIVE AND ECONOMICAL INTERVENTION PROGRAMMES.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                            
16  947 24 EFFECTS OF A 4-MONTH ANANDA YOGA PROGRAM ON PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR PERSONS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. OBJECTIVES: YOGA HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR ADDRESSING PROBLEMS WITH STRENGTH, FLEXIBILITY, BALANCE, GAIT, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND CONCENTRATION. VARYING DEGREES OF THESE PROBLEMS OCCUR IN INDIVIDUALS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS). THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF A COMPREHENSIVE, 4-MONTH YOGA PROGRAM ON STRENGTH, MOBILITY, BALANCE, RESPIRATORY FUNCTION, AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH MS.

17  386 15 BENEFITS AND ADVERSE EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA PRACTICE: A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY FROM INDIA. OBJECTIVE: BENEFITS AND ADVERSE EFFECTS OF YOGA WERE REPORTED IN SURVEYS FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO (I) DETERMINE THE BENEFITS AND ADVERSE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN YOGA EXPERIENCED PERSONS IN INDIA AND (II) CORRELATE THESE EFFECTS OF YOGA WITH FACTORS RELATED TO THE INDIVIDUAL AND THEIR YOGA PRACTICE. DESIGN AND SETTING: THIS CONVENIENCE SAMPLING IN-PERSON SURVEY REPORTS BENEFITS AND ADVERSE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN 3135 YOGA EXPERIENCED PERSONS. RESULTS: THE BENEFITS OF YOGA WERE REPORTED BY 94.5 PERCENT OF THE RESPONDENTS. THE THREE MOST COMMON BENEFITS WERE IMPROVEMENT IN: (I) PHYSICAL FITNESS, (II) MENTAL STATE AND (III) COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS. AN ADVERSE EFFECT OF YOGA WAS REPORTED BY 1.9 PERCENT OF THE RESPONDENTS. THE THREE MOST COMMON ADVERSE EFFECTS REPORTED WERE: (I) SORENESS AND PAIN, (II) MUSCLE INJURIES AND (III) FATIGUE. THE FOLLOWING FACTORS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION (IN ALL CASES P < 0.05 CHI SQUARE TEST; CRAMER'S V > 0.10) WITH REPORTED BENEFITS OF YOGA: (I) EXPERIENCE OF YOGA IN MONTHS, (II) TIME SPENT PRACTICING YOGA IN A WEEK, (III) NUMBER OF YOGA TECHNIQUES PRACTICED, AND (IV) WHETHER AWARENESS WAS MAINTAINED DURING THE YOGA PRACTICE OR NOT. CONCLUSION: BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE TO PHYSICAL HEALTH WERE THE MOST COMMON, WITH SORENESS AND PAIN THE MOST COMMON ADVERSE EFFECT OF YOGA. YOGA PRACTICE RELATED FACTORS INFLUENCE THE BENEFITS OF YOGA.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
18  293 28 AEROBIC EXERCISE AND YOGA IMPROVE NEUROCOGNITIVE FUNCTION IN WOMEN WITH EARLY PSYCHOSIS. IMPAIRMENTS OF ATTENTION AND MEMORY ARE EVIDENT IN EARLY PSYCHOSIS, AND ARE ASSOCIATED WITH FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY. IN A GROUP OF STABLE, MEDICATED WOMEN PATIENTS, WE AIMED TO DETERMINE WHETHER PARTICIPATING IN AEROBIC EXERCISE OR YOGA IMPROVED COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS AND CLINICAL SYMPTOMS. A TOTAL OF 140 FEMALE PATIENTS WERE RECRUITED, AND 124 RECEIVED THE ALLOCATED INTERVENTION IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY OF 12 WEEKS OF YOGA OR AEROBIC EXERCISE COMPARED WITH A WAITLIST GROUP. THE PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS INCLUDING MEMORY AND ATTENTION. SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES WERE THE SEVERITY OF PSYCHOTIC AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, AND HIPPOCAMPAL VOLUME. DATA FROM 124 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS BASED ON THE INTENTION-TO-TREAT PRINCIPLE. BOTH YOGA AND AEROBIC EXERCISE GROUPS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN WORKING MEMORY (P<0.01) WITH MODERATE TO LARGE EFFECT SIZES COMPARED WITH THE WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP. THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED ADDITIONAL BENEFITS IN VERBAL ACQUISITION (P<0.01) AND ATTENTION (P=0.01). BOTH TYPES OF EXERCISE IMPROVED OVERALL AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (ALL P0.01) AFTER 12 WEEKS. SMALL INCREASES IN HIPPOCAMPAL VOLUME WERE OBSERVED IN THE AEROBIC EXERCISE GROUP COMPARED WITH WAITLIST (P=0.01). BOTH TYPES OF EXERCISE IMPROVED WORKING MEMORY IN EARLY PSYCHOSIS PATIENTS, WITH YOGA HAVING A LARGER EFFECT ON VERBAL ACQUISITION AND ATTENTION THAN AEROBIC EXERCISE. THE APPLICATION OF YOGA AND AEROBIC EXERCISE AS ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENTS FOR EARLY PSYCHOSIS MERITS SERIOUS CONSIDERATION. THIS STUDY WAS SUPPORTED BY THE SMALL RESEARCH FUNDING OF THE UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG (201007176229), AND RGC FUNDING (C00240/762412) BY THE AUTHORITY OF RESEARCH, HONG KONG.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
19  330 22 APPLICATION OF AN INTEGRATIVE YOGA THERAPY PROGRAMME IN CASES OF ESSENTIAL ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION IN PUBLIC HEALTHCARE. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE EFFICACY OF AN INTEGRATIVE YOGA PROGRAMME AS ADJUVANT TREATMENT OF ESSENTIAL ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION. METHODS: AN INTEGRATIVE YOGA PROGRAMME WAS CONDUCTED DURING THREE MONTHS IN 26 SESSIONS WITH A GROUP OF TEN ESSENTIAL ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION PATIENTS AT A PUBLIC HEALTH CENTRE. THE SAME NUMBER OF PATIENTS ACTED AS THE CONTROL GROUP WITHOUT TREATMENT. THE PATIENTS WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED AND ASSIGNED TO THE GROUPS. ALL PATIENTS FILLED IN THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECT SCHEDULE (PANAS), THE HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE (HADS) AND THE SMITH RELAXATION STATES INVENTORY 3 (SRSI3) BEFORE AND AFTER THE TREATMENT. RESULTS: A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE, NEGATIVE AFFECT, SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AND DEGREE OF STRESS COULD BE OBSERVED IN THE STUDY GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: THESE POSITIVE AND PROMISING RESULTS CONFIRM THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE TECHNIQUES IN THE TREATMENT OF ESSENTIAL ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION AND SUGGEST POSSIBLE FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
20  665 28 EFFECT OF A 10-WEEK YOGA PROGRAMME ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF WOMEN AFTER BREAST CANCER SURGERY. AIM OF THE STUDY: THE FOLLOWING RESEARCH IS AIMED AT DETERMINING THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF WOMEN AFTER BREAST CANCER SURGERY. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 10-WEEK YOGA PROGRAMME INCLUDED 90-MINUTE YOGA LESSONS ONCE A WEEK. TO ESTIMATE THE QUALITY OF LIFE, QUESTIONNAIRES DEVELOPED BY THE EUROPEAN ORGANISATION FOR RESEARCH AND TREATMENT OF CANCER (QLQ-C30 AND QLQ-BR23) WERE USED. AN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP CONSISTED OF 12 WOMEN WHO PRACTISED YOGA, A CONTROL GROUP - OF 16 WOMEN WHO DID NOT. BETWEEN GROUPS THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES IN AGE, TIME FROM OPERATION AND CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH DISEASE, TREATMENT AND PARTICIPATION IN REHABILITATION. RESULTS: OUR RESULTS REVEALED AN IMPROVEMENT OF GENERAL HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE, PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL FUNCTIONING AS WELL AS A REDUCTION OF DIFFICULTIES IN DAILY ACTIVITIES AMONG EXERCISING WOMEN. ALSO THEIR FUTURE PROSPECTS ENHANCED - THEY WORRIED LESS ABOUT THEIR HEALTH THAN THEY USED TO BEFORE PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAMME. AS COMPARED TO BASELINE, AMONG EXERCISING WOMEN, FATIGUE, DYSPNOEA AND DISCOMFORT (PAIN, SWELLING, SENSITIVITY) IN THE ARM AND BREAST ON THE OPERATED SIDE DECREASED. CONCLUSIONS: PARTICIPATION IN THE EXERCISING PROGRAMME RESULTED IN AN IMPROVEMENT OF PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING, REDUCTION OF FATIGUE, DYSPNOEA, AND DISCOMFORT IN THE AREA OF THE BREAST AND ARM ON THE OPERATED SIDE. BASED ON OUR RESULTS AND THOSE OBTAINED IN FOREIGN STUDIES, WE CONCLUDE THAT REHABILITATION WITH THE USE OF YOGA PRACTICE IMPROVES THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF THE PATIENTS AFTER BREAST CANCER SURGERY. HOWEVER, WE RECOMMEND FURTHER RESEARCH ON THIS ISSUE IN POLAND.	2014

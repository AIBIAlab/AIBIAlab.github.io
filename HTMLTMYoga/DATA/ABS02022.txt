1 2022 112 SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF YOGA FOR PREGNANT WOMEN: CURRENT STATUS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS. OBJECTIVES. YOGA IS USED FOR A VARIETY OF IMMUNOLOGICAL, NEUROMUSCULAR, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND PAIN CONDITIONS. RECENT STUDIES INDICATE THAT IT MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING PREGNANCY, LABOUR, AND BIRTH OUTCOMES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EVALUATE THE EXISTING LITERATURE ON YOGA FOR PREGNANCY. METHODS. SIX DATABASES WERE SEARCHED USING THE TERMS "YOGA AND PREGNANCY" AND "YOGA AND [POST-NATAL OR POST-PARTUM]". TRIALS WERE CONSIDERED IF THEY WERE CONTROLLED AND EVALUATED A YOGA INTERVENTION. ALL STUDIES WERE EVALUATED FOR METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY ACCORDING TO THE JADAD SCALE AND THE DELPHI LIST. RESULTS. SIX TRIALS WERE IDENTIFIED: THREE WERE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) AND THREE WERE CONTROLLED TRIALS (CTS). THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY AND REPORTING RANGED FROM 0-5 ON THE JADAD SCALE AND FROM 3-6 ON THE DELPHI LIST. FINDINGS FROM THE RCT STUDIES INDICATE THAT YOGA MAY PRODUCE IMPROVEMENTS IN STRESS LEVELS, QUALITY OF LIFE, ASPECTS OF INTERPERSONAL RELATING, AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM FUNCTIONING, AND LABOUR PARAMETERS SUCH AS COMFORT, PAIN, AND DURATION. CONCLUSIONS. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA IS WELL INDICATED FOR PREGNANT WOMEN AND LEADS TO IMPROVEMENTS ON A VARIETY OF PREGNANCY, LABOUR, AND BIRTH OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, RCTS ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE MORE INFORMATION REGARDING THE UTILITY OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR PREGNANCY.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
2 2899  58 [EFFECTS OF PRENATAL YOGA: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS]. OBJECTIVES: WHILE SEVERAL STUDIES ON THE PREVENTIVE AND THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF PRENATAL YOGA (MATERNITY YOGA) HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN NO SYSTEMATIC REVIEW ON THE EFFECTS OF PRENATAL YOGA BASED ON RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCT). THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY, THEREFORE, WAS TO SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEW THE LITERATURE TO CLARIFY THE EFFECTS OF PRENATAL YOGA IN RCT FOCUSING ON THE CONTENTS OF THE INTERVENTION, THE INTERVENTION MEANS, AND THE FREQUENCY OF PRACTICE. METHODS: THE LITERATURE SEARCH WAS PERFORMED USING THE ELECTRONIC DATABASE, PUBMED. THE INCLUSION CRITERIA WERE RCT, PREGNANT WOMEN, AND YOGA INTERVENTION. RESULTS: IN TOTAL, 54 CITATIONS WERE FOUND; OF THESE, EIGHT STUDIES (10 REPORTS) WERE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS. IN FOUR STUDIES ON HEALTHY PREGNANT WOMEN, SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PAIN AND PLEASURE AT DELIVERY, DURATION OF DELIVERY, PERCEIVED STRESS LEVELS DURING PREGNANCY, ANXIETY LEVELS, DEPRESSION, PREGNANCY-RELATED EXPERIENCES, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS WERE COMPARED TO THOSE IN THE CONTROL GROUP. IN TWO STUDIES ON DEPRESSED PREGNANT WOMEN, ONE REPORTED THAT DEPRESSION, ANXIETY LEVELS, ANGER LEVELS, LEG PAIN, AND BACK PAIN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED WITH YOGA, WHILE THE OTHER FOUND NO DIFFERENCES FROM THE CONTROL GROUP. IN ONE STUDY OF HIGH-RISK PREGNANT WOMEN WITH MORBIDITY FACTORS SUCH AS OBESITY OR ADVANCED AGE, YOGA RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER CASES OF PREGNANCY-INDUCED HYPERTENSION, GESTATIONAL DIABETES, AND INTRAUTERINE GROWTH RESTRICTION, AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN PERCEIVED STRESS LEVELS. IN ONE STUDY ON PREGNANT WOMEN WITH PELVIC PAIN, THE MEDIAN PAIN SCORE WAS LOWER IN THE YOGA GROUP. REGARDING THE CONTENTS OF THE INTERVENTION, WHILE THE TWO STUDIES FOR DEPRESSED PREGNANT WOMEN ONLY INCLUDED PHYSICAL POSTURES, THE REMAINING SIX STUDIES ALSO INCLUDED BREATHING TECHNIQUE AND MEDITATION. INTERVENTIONS WERE PERFORMED USING LECTURES BY INSTRUCTORS ALONE OR TOGETHER WITH SELF-TEACHING. THE FREQUENCY OF THE INTERVENTION VARIED WITHIN EACH STUDY. CONCLUSION: THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT PRENATAL YOGA MAY HELP REDUCE PELVIC PAIN. IT MAY ALSO IMPROVE MENTAL CONDITION (STRESS, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, ETC.), PHYSICAL CONDITION (PAIN AND PLEASURE AT THE DELIVERY, ETC.), AND PERINATAL OUTCOMES (OBSTETRICAL COMPLICATIONS, DELIVERY TIME, ETC.). HOWEVER, FURTHER STUDIES ARE NEEDED. THE CONTENTS OF THE INTERVENTION, THE INTERVENTION MEANS, AND THE FREQUENCY VARIED WITH EACH STUDY. THUS, IT IS NECESSARY TO FURTHER EXAMINE THE CONTENT OF EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS, INTERVENTION MEANS, AND FREQUENCY THAT SUIT PARTICIPANT'S CHARACTERISTICS AND EACH OUTCOME. FURTHER RESEARCH IN THIS FIELD, PARTICULARLY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS, IS MERITED.	2015	

3 1040  53 EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTION DURING PREGNANCY: A REVIEW FOR CURRENT STATUS. OBJECTIVES: THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO REVIEW ALL RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS (RCTS) THAT HAVE LOOKED AT THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PREGNANCY, AND TO PRESENT THEIR EVIDENCE ON THE SPECIFIC WAYS IN WHICH PREGNANT WOMEN, AND THEIR INFANTS CAN BENEFIT FROM YOGA INTERVENTION. THE PURPOSE IS ALSO TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOGA INTERVENTION DURING PREGNANCY IS MORE BENEFICIAL THAN OTHER PHYSICAL EXERCISES. METHODS: FOUR DATABASES WERE SEARCHED USING THE TERMS "YOGA AND (PREGNANCY OR PREGNANT OR PRENATAL OR POSTNATAL OR POSTPARTUM)." DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FROM JANUARY 2004 TO FEBRUARY 2014. RESULTS: TEN RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE EVALUATED. THE FINDINGS CONSISTENTLY INDICATE THAT YOGA INTERVENTION PRESENTED WITH LOWER INCIDENCES OF PRENATAL DISORDERS (P </= 0.05), AND SMALL GESTATIONAL AGE (P < 0.05), LOWER LEVELS OF PAIN AND STRESS (P < 0.05), AND HIGHER SCORE OF RELATIONSHIP (P < 0.05). IN ADDITION, YOGA CAN BE SAFELY USED FOR PREGNANT WOMEN WHO ARE DEPRESSED, AT HIGH-RISK, OR EXPERIENCE LUMBOPELVIC PAIN. MOREOVER, YOGA IS A MORE EFFECTIVE EXERCISE THAN WALKING OR STANDARD PRENATAL EXERCISES. CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA IS A SAFE AND MORE EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION DURING PREGNANCY. HOWEVER, FURTHER RCTS ARE NEEDED TO PROVIDE FIRMER EVIDENCE REGARDING THE UTILITY AND VALIDITY OF YOGA INTERVENTION.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
4 1199  37 EXERCISE AND YOGA DURING PREGNANCY AND THEIR IMPACT ON DEPRESSION: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW. IT IS WELL ESTABLISHED THAT EXERCISE CAN IMPROVE DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IN THE GENERAL POPULATION; HOWEVER, IT IS NOT CLEAR IF THESE BENEFITS ARE ALSO SEEN IN PREGNANCY. THIS REVIEW AIMED TO SYNTHESIZE THE EVIDENCE THAT EXAMINES WHETHER EXERCISE DURING PREGNANCY IMPACTS DEPRESSIVE AND ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS (E.G. ANXIETY) DURING THE PERINATAL PERIOD. THE REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH PRISMA GUIDELINES AND REPORTING CRITERIA; LITERATURE WAS SEARCHED USING PUBMED, SCOPUS AND WEB OF SCIENCE DATABASE ENGINES. CLINICAL TRIALS PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH EVALUATING THE EFFECTS OF A DEFINED EXERCISE PROTOCOL DURING PREGNANCY ON DEPRESSIVE AND/OR ANXIETY SYMPTOMS DURING THE PERINATAL PERIOD WERE INCLUDED. STUDIES WITHOUT A CONTROL GROUP WERE EXCLUDED. RISK OF BIAS WAS CONDUCTED BY COCHRANE ASSESSMENT TO APPRAISE THE QUALITY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES. TWENTY-SEVEN ARTICLES, BETWEEN 1994 AND 2019, WERE INCLUDED. OF THESE, ONLY 5 SPECIFICALLY RECRUITED WOMEN WITH DEPRESSION (N = 334), WHICH ALL ASSESSED A YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION; 4 OF THESE STUDIES SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN DEPRESSIVE AND/OR ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP COMPARED TO BASELINE; HOWEVER, 2 OF THESE STUDIES ALSO SHOWED AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE CONTROL GROUP. THE REMAINING 22 STUDIES USED VARIOUS EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS IN PREGNANT WOMEN (N = 4808) WITH 20 STUDIES REPORTING THAT EXERCISE DURING PREGNANCY HAS THE ABILITY TO IMPROVE DEPRESSIVE AND/OR ANXIETY MEASURES IN THE PERINATAL PERIOD COMPARED TO EITHER BASELINE OR CONTROL. THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT EXERCISE OF VARIOUS TYPES IN PREGNANCY CAN REDUCE DEPRESSIVE AND/OR ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IN THE PERINATAL PERIOD IN OTHERWISE HEALTHY WOMEN. SPECIFICALLY IN WOMEN WITH ANTENATAL DEPRESSION, THE INCORPORATION OF YOGA IN PREGNANCY CAN IMPROVE DEPRESSIVE/ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IN THE PERINATAL PERIOD; HOWEVER, THIS IS BASED ON A SMALL NUMBER OF STUDIES, AND IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER THIS IS SUPERIOR TO NON-EXERCISE CONTROLS. FURTHER STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF EXERCISE OF VARIOUS TYPES DURING PREGNANCY ON SYMPTOMS OF ANTENATAL DEPRESSION.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
5 1084  36 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS MANAGEMENT IN HEALTHY ADULTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVE: THIS ARTICLE REPORTS A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON STRESS MANAGEMENT IN HEALTHY ADULTS. METHODS: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE SEARCH WAS PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) AND CLINICAL CONTROLLED TRIALS (CCTS) THAT ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS MANAGEMENT IN HEALTHY ADULTS. SELECTED STUDIES WERE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE TYPES OF INTERVENTION, DURATION, OUTCOME MEASURES, AND RESULTS. THEY WERE ALSO QUALITATIVELY ASSESSED BASED ON PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS. RESULTS: THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS BASED ON EIGHT RCTS AND CCTS THAT INDICATED A POSITIVE EFFECT OF YOGA IN REDUCING STRESS LEVELS OR STRESS SYMPTOMS. HOWEVER, MOST OF THE STUDIES HAD METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS IN THAT THE INTERVENTION DURATION WAS SHORT AND LIMITED FOLLOW-UP DATA WAS AVAILABLE. CONCLUSION: THIS REVIEW REVEALED POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS REDUCTION IN HEALTHY ADULT POPULATIONS. HOWEVER, THE RESULT SHOULD BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION DUE TO THE SMALL NUMBER OF STUDIES AND THE ASSOCIATED METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS. FURTHER STUDIES TO ASCERTAIN YOGA'S LONG-TERM EFFECTS AND THE UNDERLYING BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS LEADING TO ITS STRESS REDUCTION EFFECT SHOULD BE CONDUCTED.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
6 2689  36 YOGA IN THE WORKPLACE AND HEALTH OUTCOMES: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. BACKGROUND: HEALTH PROMOTION IN THE WORKPLACE IS INTENDED TO ENHANCE EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. YOGA PROGRAMMES ARE EASY TO IMPLEMENT AND HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF VARIOUS HEALTH CONDITIONS. AIMS: TO ASSESS THE EVIDENCE REGARDING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA PROGRAMMES AT WORK. METHODS: A SEARCH OF ELECTRONIC DATABASES OF PUBLISHED STUDIES UP UNTIL THE 1ST OF APRIL 2017. INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WERE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS OF ADULT EMPLOYEES AND YOGA IN THE WORKPLACE. QUALITY APPRAISAL WAS CARRIED OUT USING THE COCHRANE COLLABORATION'S TOOL FOR ASSESSING RISK OF BIAS IN RANDOMIZED TRIALS. RESULTS: OF 1343 PAPERS IDENTIFIED, 13 STUDIES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. NINE OUT OF 13 TRIALS WERE CLASSIFIED AS HAVING AN UNCLEAR RISK OF BIAS. THE OVERALL EFFECTS OF YOGA ON MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES WERE BENEFICIAL, MAINLY ON STRESS. MOST OF THE CARDIOVASCULAR ENDPOINTS SHOWED NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN YOGA AND CONTROLS. OTHER OUTCOMES REPORTED POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA OR NO CHANGE. CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT YOGA HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON HEALTH IN THE WORKPLACE, PARTICULARLY IN REDUCING STRESS, AND NO NEGATIVE EFFECTS WERE REPORTED IN ANY OF THE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. FURTHER LARGER STUDIES ARE REQUIRED TO CONFIRM THIS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
7 1519  46 IS YOGA EFFECTIVE FOR PAIN? A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AS A TREATMENT OPTION FOR ANY TYPE OF PAIN. METHOD: SEVEN DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FROM THEIR INCEPTION TO FEBRUARY 2011. RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS WERE CONSIDERED IF THEY INVESTIGATED YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH ANY TYPE OF PAIN AND IF THEY ASSESSED PAIN AS A PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE. THE 5-POINT JADAD SCALE WAS USED TO ASSESS METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF STUDIES. THE SELECTION OF STUDIES, DATA EXTRACTION AND QUALITY ASSESSMENT WERE PERFORMED INDEPENDENTLY BY TWO REVIEWERS. RESULTS: TEN RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS (RCTS) MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. THEIR METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY RANGED BETWEEN 1 AND 4 ON THE JADAD SCALE. NINE RCTS SUGGESTED THAT YOGA LEADS TO A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER REDUCTION IN PAIN THAN VARIOUS CONTROL INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS STANDARD CARE, SELF CARE, THERAPEUTIC EXERCISES, RELAXING YOGA, TOUCH AND MANIPULATION, OR NO INTERVENTION. ONE RCT FAILED TO PROVIDE BETWEEN GROUP DIFFERENCES IN PAIN SCORES. CONCLUSIONS: IT IS CONCLUDED THAT YOGA HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR ALLEVIATING PAIN. HOWEVER, DEFINITIVE JUDGMENTS ARE NOT POSSIBLE.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
8 1031  42 EFFECTS OF YOGA EXERCISES FOR HEADACHES: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. [PURPOSE] TO ASSESS THE EVIDENCE FOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA EXERCISES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HEADACHES. [SUBJECTS AND METHODS] A SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED OF SIX ELECTRONIC DATABASES TO IDENTIFY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) REPORTING THE EFFECTS OF YOGIC INTERVENTION ON HEADACHES PUBLISHED IN ANY LANGUAGE BEFORE JANUARY 2015. QUALITY ASSESSMENT WAS CONDUCTED USING THE COCHRANE RISK OF BIAS TOOL. [RESULTS] ONE POTENTIAL TRIAL WAS IDENTIFIED AND INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW. THE QUALITY CRITICAL APPRAISAL INDICATED A MODERATE RISK OF BIAS. THE AVAILABLE DATA COULD ONLY BE INCLUDED AS A NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION. HEADACHE INTENSITY AND FREQUENCY, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCORES, AND SYMPTOMATIC MEDICATION USE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN THE YOGA GROUP COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. [CONCLUSION] THERE IS EVIDENCE FROM ONE RCT THAT YOGA EXERCISES MAY BE BENEFICIAL FOR HEADACHES. HOWEVER, THE FINDINGS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION DUE TO THE SMALL NUMBER OF RCTS. THEREFORE, FURTHER RIGOROUS METHODOLOGICAL AND HIGH QUALITY RCTS ARE REQUIRED TO INVESTIGATE THE HYPOTHESIS THAT YOGA EXERCISES ALLEVIATE HEADACHES, AND TO CONFIRM AND FURTHER COMPREHEND THE EFFECTS OF STANDARDIZED YOGA PROGRAMS ON HEADACHES.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
9 2105  31 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON MENSTRUAL DISORDERS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVE: TO SUMMARIZE AND EVALUATE EVIDENCE FOR THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON MENSTRUAL DISORDERS. METHODS: PUBMED, CINAHL/MEDLINE, WEB OF SCIENCE, AMED, AND SCOPUS WERE SEARCHED FOR ENGLISH-LANGUAGE LITERATURE RELEVANT TO THE REVIEW QUESTION. ALL PRIMARY RESEARCH STUDIES WERE INCLUDED. RESULTS: FIFTEEN STUDIES DESCRIBED IN 18 PAPERS WERE INCLUDED IN THE REVIEW. A RANGE OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS WERE USED. SOME STUDIES USED A COMBINATION OF ASANA, PRANAYAMA, AND OTHER YOGIC RELAXATION OR MEDITATION TECHNIQUES. ALL INCLUDED STUDIES REPORTED SOME CHANGE IN THEIR OUTCOME MEASURES, SUGGESTING REDUCED SYMPTOMS OF MENSTRUAL DISTRESS FOLLOWING A YOGA INTERVENTION; HOWEVER, THE HETEROGENEITY AND INTENSITY OF THE INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOME MEASURES MEANT THAT FINDINGS HAVE LIMITED GENERALIZABILITY AND APPLICABILITY IN PRACTICE SETTINGS. CONCLUSIONS: FURTHER RESEARCH ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOGA PRACTICE AND MENSTRUAL DISORDERS IS WARRANTED, BUT THERE MUST BE BOTH CONSISTENCY IN THE METHODS, MEASURES, AND QUALITY OF STUDIES AND A SHIFT TOWARD RESEARCH ON YOGA PRACTICES THAT ARE REPLICABLE OUTSIDE OF THE CLINICAL TRIAL SETTING.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
10  522  35 COMPARISON GROUPS IN YOGA RESEARCH: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND CRITICAL EVALUATION OF THE LITERATURE. OBJECTIVES: COMPARISON GROUPS ARE ESSENTIAL FOR ACCURATE TESTING AND INTERPRETATION OF YOGA INTERVENTION TRIALS. HOWEVER, SELECTING PROPER COMPARISON GROUPS IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE YOGA COMPRISES A VERY HETEROGENEOUS SET OF PRACTICES AND ITS MECHANISMS OF EFFECT HAVE NOT BEEN CONCLUSIVELY ESTABLISHED. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE CONTROL AND COMPARISON GROUPS USED IN PUBLISHED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) OF YOGA. RESULTS: WE LOCATED 128 RCTS THAT MET OUR INCLUSION CRITERIA; OF THESE, 65 INCLUDED ONLY A PASSIVE CONTROL AND 63 INCLUDED AT LEAST ONE ACTIVE COMPARISON GROUP. PRIMARY COMPARISON GROUPS WERE PHYSICAL EXERCISE (43%), RELAXATION/MEDITATION (20%), AND EDUCATION (16%). STUDIES RARELY PROVIDED A STRONG RATIONALE FOR CHOICE OF COMPARISON. CONSIDERING YEAR OF PUBLICATION, THE USE OF ACTIVE CONTROLS IN YOGA RESEARCH APPEARS TO BE SLOWLY INCREASING OVER TIME. CONCLUSIONS: GIVEN THAT YOGA HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AS A POTENTIALLY POWERFUL INTERVENTION, FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD USE ACTIVE CONTROL GROUPS. FURTHER, CARE IS NEEDED TO SELECT COMPARISON CONDITIONS THAT HELP TO ISOLATE THE SPECIFIC MECHANISMS OF YOGA'S EFFECTS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
11 1516  34 IS YOGA AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN COMPARED WITH OTHER CARE MODALITIES - A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO ASSESS RANDOMIZED-CONTROL TRIALS (RCTS) TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) COMPARED WITH OTHER CARE MODALITIES. METHODS: A SEARCH STRATEGY WAS FORMULATED WITH KEY CONCEPTS IDENTIFIED USING THE PICO PROCESS. FOUR DATABASES WERE SEARCHED IN JUNE 2012. APPROPRIATE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA WERE SET AND IMPLEMENTED. RESULTS: FOUR RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. ALL FOUR PAPERS FOUND THAT YOGA LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN BACK FUNCTION, AND THREE DEMONSTRATED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN BACK PAIN WHEN COMPARED WITH CERTAIN CARE MODALITIES. ALL PAPERS HAD SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS IDENTIFIED, HOWEVER. CONCLUSIONS: GIVEN THE LIMITATIONS IDENTIFIED WITHIN THE STUDIES, THE CONCLUSIONS DRAWN MUST BE CONSIDERED CONSERVATIVELY. ALTHOUGH EARLY RESULTS APPEAR PROMISING, BUT FURTHER WELL-DESIGNED RCTS ARE WARRANTED, WITH MULTIPLE, SPECIFIED COMPARATOR CARE MODALITIES BEFORE FIRM CONCLUSIONS CAN BE GAINED.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
12  236  49 A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW: THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PREGNANCY. OBJECTIVE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED TO UPDATE AND PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF ANTENATAL YOGA ON PREGNANCY COMPARED TO STANDARD PRENATAL CARE. STUDY DESIGN: FOUR DATABASES WERE SEARCHED USING KEYWORDS "YOGA", "PREGNANCY", "PERINATAL CARE", "PRENATAL CARE", "POSTNATAL CARE", "POSTPARTUM PERIOD", "PERIPARTUM PERIOD", "PATIENT OUTCOME ASSESSMENT", "OUTCOME ASSESSMENT", "PREGNANCY OUTCOME", "TREATMENT OUTCOME". TRIALS WERE CONSIDERED IF THEY WERE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) PUBLISHED FROM 2011 TO 2018 AND EVALUATED AN ANTENATAL YOGA INTERVENTION. ALL STUDIES WERE ASSESSED FOR RISK OF BIAS USING THE COCHRANE CRITERIA. TRIAL CHARACTERISTICS AND OUTCOMES WERE EXTRACTED AND SYNTHESIZED DESCRIPTIVELY WHERE POSSIBLE. DUE TO HETEROGENEITY, META-ANALYSIS WAS NOT POSSIBLE. RESULTS: OF THE 175 NON-DUPLICATED STUDIES, 16 MET CRITERIA FOR FULL-TEXT REVIEW. FIVE RCTS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA AND WERE INCLUDED IN THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. THE FINDINGS OF THE RCTS SUGGEST ANTENATAL YOGA MAY BE SAFE AND MAY EFFECTIVELY DECREASE STRESS LEVELS, ANXIETY SCORES, DEPRESSION SCORES, AND PAIN RESPONSE AS WELL AS INCREASING MATERNAL IMMUNITY AND EMOTIONAL-WELLBEING. CONCLUSION: YOGA APPEARS TO BE SAFE AND MAY IMPROVE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PREGNANCY OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE LIMITED NUMBER OF STUDIES, MORE HIGH-QUALITY, LARGE RCTS ARE NEEDED TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS ABOUT IMPROVEMENT IN OTHER PREGNANCY OUTCOMES.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
13  309  50 AN EVIDENCE-BASED REVIEW OF YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY INTERVENTION FOR PATIENTS WITH CANCER. OBJECTIVE: TO CONDUCT AN EVIDENCE-BASED REVIEW OF YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR PATIENTS WITH CANCER. SPECIFICALLY, THIS PAPER REVIEWED THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON PSYCHOLOGICAL ADJUSTMENT AMONG CANCER PATIENTS. METHODS: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED BETWEEN MAY 2007 AND APRIL 2008. DATA FROM EACH IDENTIFIED STUDY WERE EXTRACTED BY TWO INDEPENDENT RATERS; STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IF THEY ASSESSED PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONING AND FOCUSED ON YOGA AS A MAIN INTERVENTION. USING A QUALITY RATING SCALE (RANGE = 9-45), THE RATERS ASSESSED THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF THE STUDIES, AND CONSORT GUIDELINES WERE USED TO ASSESS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS). EFFECT SIZES WERE CALCULATED WHEN POSSIBLE. IN ADDITION, EACH STUDY WAS NARRATIVELY REVIEWED WITH ATTENTION TO OUTCOME VARIABLES, THE TYPE OF YOGA INTERVENTION EMPLOYED, AND METHODOLOGICAL STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS. RESULTS: TEN STUDIES WERE INCLUDED, INCLUDING SIX RCTS. ACROSS STUDIES, THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS WERE WOMEN, AND BREAST CANCER WAS THE MOST COMMON DIAGNOSIS. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY RANGED GREATLY ACROSS STUDIES (RANGE = 15.5-42), WITH THE AVERAGE RATING (M = 33.55) INDICATING ADEQUATE QUALITY. STUDIES ALSO VARIED IN TERMS OF CANCER POPULATIONS AND YOGA INTERVENTIONS SAMPLED. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY PROVIDED A SYSTEMATIC EVALUATION OF THE YOGA AND CANCER LITERATURE. ALTHOUGH SOME POSITIVE RESULTS WERE NOTED, VARIABILITY ACROSS STUDIES AND METHODOLOGICAL DRAWBACKS LIMIT THE EXTENT TO WHICH YOGA CAN BE DEEMED EFFECTIVE FOR MANAGING CANCER-RELATED SYMPTOMS. HOWEVER, FURTHER RESEARCH IN THIS AREA IS CERTAINLY WARRANTED. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD EXAMINE WHAT COMPONENTS OF YOGA ARE MOST BENEFICIAL, AND WHAT TYPES OF PATIENTS RECEIVE THE GREATEST BENEFIT FROM YOGA INTERVENTIONS.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
14 2915  36 [SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF YOGA FOR DEPRESSION AND QUALITY OF SLEEP IN THE ELDERLY]. BACKGROUND: AGING AND AGE-RELATED HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE MAJOR ISSUES OF CONCERN FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH SERVICES. YOGA IS AN EXERCISE WITH BOTH PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS ON AGING. ALTHOUGH MANY STUDIES HAVE ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN THE ELDERLY, LITTLE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE IN THE LITERATURE TO SUPPORT EMPIRICAL CONCLUSIONS. PURPOSE: THIS REVIEW SYNTHESIZES AND CHARACTERIZES FINDINGS RELATED TO THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON DEPRESSION AND QUALITY OF SLEEP IN THE ELDERLY. METHODS: RESEARCHERS USED KEYWORDS INCLUDING YOGA, ELDERLY, AGED / OLDER ADULT, DEPRESSION, SLEEP, AND QUALITY TO SEARCH 6 ELECTRONIC DATABASES FOR RELEVANT STUDIES PUBLISHED PRIOR TO MARCH 2013. INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA WERE USED TO SCREEN IDENTIFIED STUDY ABSTRACTS. THE JADAD SCALE APPRAISED THE QUALITY OF IDENTIFIED STUDIES. RESULTS: SEVEN STUDIES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. FIVE STUDIES FOUND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PARTICIPANT DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AFTER DOING YOGA. THREE STUDIES FOUND SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON THE QUALITY OF SLEEP OF PARTICIPANTS AFTER 6 MONTHS OF DOING YOGA. CONCLUSION: YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS OF ELDERLY PARTICIPANTS AND IMPROVED THEIR QUALITY OF SLEEP AFTER 6 MONTHS. FINDINGS WERE SIMILAR FOR ELDERLY LIVING IN INSTITUTIONS AND IN THE COMMUNITY. HOWEVER, THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE ASSESSED STUDIES WERE WOMEN CHARACTERIZED BY A HIGH LEVEL OF SOCIAL PARTICIPATION AND PROACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN HEALTH PROMOTION ACTIVITIES. FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD BROADEN THE SCOPE OF RESEARCH TO ADDRESS DIFFERENT AGING POPULATIONS AND USE LONG-TERM COHORT OBSERVATIONS IN ORDER TO BETTER ELICIT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AND TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO INTRODUCE YOGA INTO DAILY ACTIVITIES.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
15 2569  43 YOGA FOR DEPRESSION: THE RESEARCH EVIDENCE. BACKGROUND: YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS MAY PROVE TO BE AN ATTRACTIVE OPTION FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEW THE RESEARCH EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR THIS INDICATION. METHODS: SEARCHES OF THE MAJOR BIOMEDICAL DATABASES INCLUDING MEDLINE, EMBASE, CLNAHL, PSYCINFO AND THE COCHRANE LIBRARY WERE CONDUCTED. SPECIALIST COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE (CAM) AND THE INDMED DATABASES WERE ALSO SEARCHED AND EFFORTS MADE TO IDENTIFY UNPUBLISHED AND ONGOING RESEARCH. SEARCHES WERE CONDUCTED BETWEEN JANUARY AND JUNE 2004. RELEVANT RESEARCH WAS CATEGORISED BY STUDY TYPE AND APPRAISED. CLINICAL COMMENTARIES WERE OBTAINED FOR STUDIES REPORTING CLINICAL OUTCOMES. RESULTS: FIVE RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE LOCATED, EACH OF WHICH UTILISED DIFFERENT FORMS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS AND IN WHICH THE SEVERITY OF THE CONDITION RANGED FROM MILD TO SEVERE. ALL TRIALS REPORTED POSITIVE FINDINGS BUT METHODOLOGICAL DETAILS SUCH AS METHOD OF RANDOMISATION, COMPLIANCE AND ATTRITION RATES WERE MISSING. NO ADVERSE EFFECTS WERE REPORTED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF FATIGUE AND BREATHLESSNESS IN PARTICIPANTS IN ONE STUDY. LIMITATIONS: NO LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS WERE IMPOSED ON THE SEARCHES CONDUCTED BUT NO SEARCHES OF DATABASES IN LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH WERE INCLUDED. CONCLUSIONS: OVERALL, THE INITIAL INDICATIONS ARE OF POTENTIALLY BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS. VARIATION IN INTERVENTIONS, SEVERITY AND REPORTING OF TRIAL METHODOLOGY SUGGESTS THAT THE FINDINGS MUST BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION. SEVERAL OF THE INTERVENTIONS MAY NOT BE FEASIBLE IN THOSE WITH REDUCED OR IMPAIRED MOBILITY. NEVERTHELESS, FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION IS WARRANTED.	2005	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
16 2087  36 THE EFFECT OF MUSIC, MASSAGE, YOGA AND EXERCISE ON ANTENATAL DEPRESSION: A META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: PRENATAL DEPRESSION AFFECTS 20.7 PERCENT OF WOMEN WORLDWIDE, WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED WITH PRETERM BIRTH, LOW BIRTH WEIGHT AND APGAR SCORE, AS WELL AS COGNITIVE, EMOTIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL DEVELOPMENT DISORDERS. WE CONDUCTED A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS TO RETRIEVE THE LATEST AND BEST EVIDENCE ABOUT MUSIC, MASSAGE, YOGA AND EXERCISE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF PRENATAL DEPRESSION, AND TO PRELIMINARILY COMPARE THE FOUR METHODS TO EXPLORE THE MOST EFFECTIVE MEANS. WE ALSO COMPARED DIFFERENT TYPES OF YOGA AND MUSIC, IN ORDER TO FIND THE MOST EFFECTIVE TYPE OF INTERVENTION. METHODS: A COMPREHENSIVE LITERATURE SEARCH WAS CARRIED OUT THROUGH SIX DATABASES ON RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS). EFFECTS WERE SUMMARIZED BY A RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL USING MEAN DIFFERENCES WITH 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS. EVIDENCE QUALITY WAS ASSESSED USING THE GRADING OF RECOMMENDATIONS ASSESSMENT, DEVELOPMENT, AND EVALUATION (GRADE) CRITERIA. RESULTS: THIS RESEARCH FOUND LOW TO VERY LOW EVIDENCE THAT YOGA, EXERCISE, MUSIC AND MASSAGE COULD REDUCE ANTENATAL DEPRESSION. AMONG THEM, MUSIC MAY BE THE MOST EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION, AND INTEGRATED YOGA OTHER THAN SIMPLE YOGA WOULD IMPROVE PRENATAL DEPRESSION. THE EFFECT OF CHINESE MEDICINE FIVE ELEMENT MUSIC MAY BE BETTER THAN ORDINARY MUSIC. CONCLUSION: IT IS IMPORTANT TO SUPPORT PRENATAL DEPRESSION PATIENTS TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THEIR BEHAVIOR THERAPY.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
17 2488  34 YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR THE REDUCTION OF SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW IS TO EVALUATE THE IMPLEMENTATION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR THE REDUCTION OF SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION IN YOUTH. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THERE ARE NO SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS TO DATE LOOKING AT THE REDUCTION OF SYMPTOMS OF BOTH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. METHODS: NUMEROUS SCIENTIFIC DATABASES WERE SEARCHED UP TO NOVEMBER 2018 FOR EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES ASSESSING CHANGES IN SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AND/OR DEPRESSION IN YOUTHS FOLLOWING YOGA INTERVENTIONS. QUALITY AND LEVEL OF EVIDENCE WERE ASSESSED, AND INFORMATION WAS SYNTHESIZED ACROSS STUDIES. RESULTS: TWENTY-SEVEN STUDIES INVOLVING YOUTH WITH VARYING HEALTH STATUSES WERE REVIEWED. INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS VARIED GREATLY ACROSS STUDIES REVEALING MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT MAY IMPACT INTERVENTION EFFICACY, HOWEVER 70% OF THE STUDIES OVERALL SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS. FOR STUDIES ASSESSING ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, 58% SHOWED REDUCTIONS IN BOTH SYMPTOMS, WHILE 25% SHOWED REDUCTIONS IN ANXIETY ONLY. ADDITIONALLY, 70% OF STUDIES ASSESSING ANXIETY ALONE SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS AND 40% OF STUDIES ONLY ASSESSING DEPRESSION SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS. CONCLUSION: THE STUDIES REVIEWED, WHILE OF WEAK TO MODERATE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY, SHOWED THAT YOGA, DEFINED BY THE PRACTICE OF POSTURES, GENERALLY LEADS TO SOME REDUCTIONS IN ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION IN YOUTH REGARDLESS OF HEALTH STATUS AND INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
18 2742  37 YOGA PRACTICE FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE II DIABETES MELLITUS IN ADULTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. THE EFFECT OF PRACTICING YOGA FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE II DIABETES WAS ASSESSED IN THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW THROUGH SEARCHING RELATED ELECTRONIC DATABASES AND THE GREY LITERATURE TO THE END OF MAY 2007 USING OVID. ALL RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS (RCTS) COMPARING YOGA PRACTICE WITH OTHER TYPE OF INTERVENTION OR WITH REGULAR PRACTICE OR BOTH, WERE INCLUDED REGARDLESS OF LANGUAGE OR TYPE OF PUBLICATION. EACH STUDY WAS ASSESSED FOR QUALITY BY TWO INDEPENDENT REVIEWERS. MEAN DIFFERENCE WAS USED FOR SUMMARIZING THE EFFECT OF EACH STUDY OUTCOMES WITH 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS. POOLING OF THE STUDIES DID NOT TAKE PLACE DUE TO THE WIDE CLINICAL VARIATION BETWEEN THE STUDIES. PUBLICATION BIAS WAS ASSESSED BY STATISTICAL METHODS. FIVE TRIALS WITH 363 PARTICIPANTS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA WITH MEDIUM TO HIGH RISK OF BIAS AND DIFFERENT INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS. THE STUDIES' RESULTS SHOW IMPROVEMENT IN OUTCOMES AMONG PATIENTS WITH DIABETES TYPE II. THESE IMPROVEMENTS WERE MAINLY AMONG SHORT TERM OR IMMEDIATE DIABETES OUTCOMES AND NOT ALL WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. THE RESULTS WERE INCONCLUSIVE AND NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR THE LONG-TERM OUTCOMES. NO ADVERSE EFFECTS WERE REPORTED IN ANY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES. SHORT-TERM BENEFITS FOR PATIENTS WITH DIABETES MAY BE ACHIEVED FROM PRACTICING YOGA. FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED IN THIS AREA. FACTORS LIKE QUALITY OF THE TRIALS AND OTHER METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES SHOULD BE IMPROVED BY LARGE RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS WITH ALLOCATION CONCEALMENT TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA ON DIABETES TYPE II. A DEFINITIVE RECOMMENDATION FOR PHYSICIANS TO ENCOURAGE THEIR PATIENTS TO PRACTICE YOGA CANNOT BE REACHED AT PRESENT.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
19  340  37 ARE THERE BENEFITS FROM TEACHING YOGA AT SCHOOLS? A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS. INTRODUCTION. YOGA IS A HOLISTIC SYSTEM OF VARIED MIND-BODY PRACTICES THAT CAN BE USED TO IMPROVE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH AND IT HAS BEEN UTILIZED IN A VARIETY OF CONTEXTS AND SITUATIONS. EDUCATORS AND SCHOOLS ARE LOOKING TO INCLUDE YOGA AS A COST-EFFECTIVE, EVIDENCE-BASED COMPONENT OF URGENTLY NEEDED WELLNESS PROGRAMS FOR THEIR STUDENTS. OBJECTIVES. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THIS STUDY WAS TO SYSTEMATICALLY EXAMINE THE AVAILABLE LITERATURE FOR YOGA INTERVENTIONS EXCLUSIVELY IN SCHOOL SETTINGS, EXPLORING THE EVIDENCE OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ON ACADEMIC, COGNITIVE, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL BENEFITS. METHODS. AN EXTENSIVE SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED FOR STUDIES PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1980 AND OCTOBER 31, 2014 (PUBMED, PSYCINFO, EMBASE, ISI, AND THE COCHRANE LIBRARY). EFFECT SIZE ANALYSIS, THROUGH STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE AND HEDGES'G, ALLOWED FOR THE COMPARISON BETWEEN EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS. NINE RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS MET CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION IN THIS REVIEW. EFFECT SIZE WAS FOUND FOR MOOD INDICATORS, TENSION AND ANXIETY IN THE POMS SCALE, SELF-ESTEEM, AND MEMORY WHEN THE YOGA GROUPS WERE COMPARED TO CONTROL. FUTURE RESEARCH REQUIRES GREATER STANDARDIZATION AND SUITABILITY OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR CHILDREN.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
20 2422  42 YOGA AND MINDFULNESS AS THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS FOR STROKE REHABILITATION: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. AIM. THIS PAPER REPORTS A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF THE EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BEHAVIORAL THERAPIES SUCH AS YOGA AND MINDFULNESS PRACTICES FOR STROKE REHABILITATION. BACKGROUND. THE EXPERIENCE OF STROKE CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON BOTH PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH AND ON QUALITY OF LIFE. YOGA AND RELEVANT PRACTICES ARE PROMISING THERAPIES THAT HAVE BEEN USED WITH PATIENTS WITH A VARIETY OF CONDITIONS. IN ORDER TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS ON EFFECTIVENESS FOR STROKE PATIENTS, THE EVIDENCE REQUIRES SYSTEMATIC ASSESSMENT. METHODS. A COMPREHENSIVE SEARCH OF MAJOR BIOMEDICAL AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE DATABASES WAS CONDUCTED. RELEVANT RESEARCH WAS CATEGORIZED BY STUDY TYPE AND APPRAISED ACCORDING TO STUDY DESIGN. RESULTS. FIVE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS AND FOUR SINGLE CASE STUDIES WERE FOUND. ADDITIONALLY, ONE QUALITATIVE RESEARCH STUDY WAS IDENTIFIED. STUDIES REPORTED POSITIVE RESULTS, INCLUDING IMPROVEMENTS IN COGNITION, MOOD, AND BALANCE AND REDUCTIONS IN STRESS. MODIFICATIONS TO DIFFERENT YOGA PRACTICES MAKE COMPARISON BETWEEN STUDIES DIFFICULT, AND A LACK OF CONTROLLED STUDIES PRECLUDES ANY FIRM CONCLUSIONS ON EFFICACY. CONCLUSION. YOGA AND MINDFULNESS COULD BE CLINICALLY VALUABLE SELF-ADMINISTERED INTERVENTION OPTIONS FOR STROKE REHABILITATION. FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO EVALUATE THESE SPECIFIC PRACTICES AND THEIR SUITABILITY IN STROKE REHABILITATION.	2013

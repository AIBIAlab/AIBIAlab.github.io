1 1924 129 ROLE OF YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH TYPE II DIABETES MELLITUS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE AND EFFICACY OF YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS, THIS META-ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED. ELECTRONIC DATA BASES SEARCHED WERE PUBMED/MEDLINE, PROQUEST, PSYCINFO, INDMED, CENTRAL, COCHRANE LIBRARY, CAMQUEST AND CAMBASE TILL DECEMBER 17, 2014. ELIGIBLE OUTCOMES WERE FASTING BLOOD SUGAR (FBS), POST PRANDIAL BLOOD SUGAR (PPBS) AND GLYCOSYLATED HAEMOGLOBIN (HBA1C). RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS AND CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE ELIGIBLE. STUDIES FOCUSSING ONLY ON RELAXATION OR MEDITATION OR MULTIMODAL INTERVENTION WERE NOT INCLUDED. A TOTAL OF 17 RCTS WERE INCLUDED FOR REVIEW. DATA FROM RESEARCH ARTICLES ON PATIENTS, METHODS, INTERVENTIONS- CONTROL AND RESULTS WERE EXTRACTED. MEAN AND STANDARD DEVIATIONS WERE UTILIZED FOR CALCULATING STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE WITH 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL. HETEROGENEITY WAS ASSESSED WITH THE HELP OF I(2) STATISTICS. CHI(2) WAS USED TO RULE OUT THE EFFECTS OF HETEROGENEITY DUE TO CHANCE ALONE. BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA AS AN ADD-ON INTERVENTION TO STANDARD TREATMENT IN COMPARISON TO STANDARD TREATMENT WERE OBSERVED FOR FBS [STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE (SMD) -1.40, 95%CI -1.90 TO -0.90, P<0.00001]; PPBS [SMD -0.91, 95%CI -1.34 TO -0.48, P<0.0001] AS WELL AS HBA1C [SMD -0.64, 95%CI -0.97 TO -0.30, P<0.0002]. BUT RISK OF BIAS WAS OVERALL HIGH FOR INCLUDED STUDIES. WITH THIS AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, YOGA CAN BE CONSIDERED AS ADD-ON INTERVENTION FOR MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
2 2723  28 YOGA MODULE FOR SOMATOFORM PAIN DISORDERS: DEVELOPMENT, CONTENT VALIDATION, AND FEASIBILITY TESTING. BACKGROUND: YOGA PRACTICES HAVE BEEN FOUND TO BE USEFUL IN CHRONIC PAIN CONDITIONS BUT STUDIES FOCUSSING SPECIFICALLY ON SOMATOFORM PAIN DISORDERS (SPDS) ARE LIMITED. AIMS: CURRENT STUDY AIMS TO DEVELOP AND TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA PROGRAM FOR PATIENTS WITH SPDS. MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY: ATHOROUGH SEARCH OF TRADITIONAL AND CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE WAS PERFORMED WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF FORMULATING A YOGA PROGRAM FOR REDUCING CHRONIC NON-SPECIFIC PAIN AND ASSOCIATED PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. CONTENT VALIDITY OF THE PROGRAM WAS THEN DETERMINED BY TAKING THE OPINION OF 18 YOGA EXPERTS (WHO HAD >5 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN TREATING MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS) USING CONTENT VALIDATION RATIO (CVR) THROUGH LAWSHE'S FORMULA. THE FEASIBILITY OF THE MODULE WAS TESTED ON 10 SUBJECTS DIAGNOSED WITH SPDS AS PER THE INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES (ICD) -10 CRITERIA USING STANDARD SCALES. RESULTS: IN THE FINALIZED MODULE, 70.83% (34 OUT OF 48 ITEMS) OF THE PRACTICES WERE RETAINED ALONG WITH THE MODIFICATIONS AS SUGGESTED BY THE EXPERTS. TWO PRACTICES WERE NOT FOUND TO BE FEASIBLE (TRIKONASANA AND SHALABHASANA) AND HENCE WERE REMOVED FROM THE FINAL MODULE. A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PAIN SEVERITY WAS OBSERVED IN THE SUBJECTS AFTER PRACTISING THE YOGA MODULE FOR 2 WEEKS. THE CONTENT VALIDITY INDEX FOR THE WHOLE MODULE (AVERAGE OF ALL CVRS) WAS 0.55. CONCLUSIONS: AYOGA MODULE WAS DEVELOPED FOR SPD. THE CONTENT VALIDITY OF THE MODULE WAS FOUND TO BE GOOD. THE MODULE WAS FOUND SAFE AND POTENTIALLY USEFUL FOR REDUCING PAIN SEVERITY IN PATIENTS WITH SPD. FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD TEST THE EFFICACY OF THE DEVELOPED PROGRAM THROUGH A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
3 1069  32 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH: A SHORT SUMMARY OF REVIEWS. THIS REPORT SUMMARIZES THE CURRENT EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH, BY FOCUSSING ON THE EVIDENCE DESCRIBED IN REVIEW ARTICLES. COLLECTIVELY, THESE REVIEWS SUGGEST A NUMBER OF AREAS WHERE YOGA MAY WELL BE BENEFICIAL, BUT MORE RESEARCH IS REQUIRED FOR VIRTUALLY ALL OF THEM TO FIRMLY ESTABLISH SUCH BENEFITS. THE HETEROGENEITY AMONG INTERVENTIONS AND CONDITIONS STUDIED HAS HAMPERED THE USE OF META-ANALYSIS AS AN APPROPRIATE TOOL FOR SUMMARIZING THE CURRENT LITERATURE. NEVERTHELESS, THERE ARE SOME META-ANALYSES WHICH INDICATE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS, AND THERE ARE SEVERAL RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS (RCT'S) OF RELATIVELY HIGH QUALITY INDICATING BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA FOR PAIN-ASSOCIATED DISABILITY AND MENTAL HEALTH. YOGA MAY WELL BE EFFECTIVE AS A SUPPORTIVE ADJUNCT TO MITIGATE SOME MEDICAL CONDITIONS, BUT NOT YET A PROVEN STAND-ALONE, CURATIVE TREATMENT. LARGER-SCALE AND MORE RIGOROUS RESEARCH WITH HIGHER METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY AND ADEQUATE CONTROL INTERVENTIONS IS HIGHLY ENCOURAGED BECAUSE YOGA MAY HAVE POTENTIAL TO BE IMPLEMENTED AS A BENEFICIAL SUPPORTIVE/ADJUNCT TREATMENT THAT IS RELATIVELY COST-EFFECTIVE, MAY BE PRACTICED AT LEAST IN PART AS A SELF-CARE BEHAVIORAL TREATMENT, PROVIDES A LIFE-LONG BEHAVIOURAL SKILL, ENHANCES SELF-EFFICACY AND SELF-CONFIDENCE AND IS OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH ADDITIONAL POSITIVE SIDE EFFECTS.	2012

7 1755  20 PLASTICITY OF MOTOR CONTROL SYSTEMS DEMONSTRATED BY YOGA TRAINING. THE STATIC MOTOR PERFORMANCE WAS TESTED IN TWO GROUPS WITH 20 SUBJECTS IN EACH (AGE RANGE 17 TO 22 YEARS, AND 5 FEMALES IN EACH GROUP). TESTS WERE CARRIED OUT AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF A 10 DAY PERIOD. THE TEST REQUIRED BEING ABLE TO INSERT AND HOLD A METAL STYLUS WITHIN HOLES OF VARYING SIZES FOR 15 SEC. ACCIDENTAL CONTACTS BETWEEN THE STYLUS AND THE SIDES OF THE HOLES, WERE REGISTERED ON A COUNTER AS ERRORS. DURING THE 10 DAYS ONE GROUP (THE YOGA GROUP) PRACTISED ASANAS (PHYSICAL POSTURES), PRANAYAMA (VOLUNTARY REGULATION OF BREATHING), MEDITATION, DEVOTIONAL SESSIONS, AND TRATAKAS (VISUAL FOCUSSING EXERCISES). THE CONTROL GROUP FOLLOWED THEIR USUAL ROUTINE. AT THE END OF 10 DAYS THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN NUMBER OF ERRORS (WILCOXON PAIRED SIGNED RANKS TEST), WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT CHANGE. OUR EARLIER STUDY SHOWED A SIMILAR IMPROVEMENT IN CHILDREN (9-13 YEARS). IT WAS INTERESTING TO NOTE THE SAME DEGREE OF PLASTICITY IN MOTOR CONTROL SYSTEMS IN YOUNG ADULTS. THE IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION PROGRAMMES HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED.	1994	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
8 2578  36 YOGA FOR HEALTH CARE IN KOREA: A PROTOCOL FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF CLINICAL TRIALS. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AIMS TO EVALUATE THE THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY USING AN EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH AND INVESTIGATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOGA AND THE MERIDIAN ENERGIES BASED ON ALL AVAILABLE CLINICAL STUDIES IN KOREA. SIXTEEN ELECTRONIC DATABASES WILL BE SEARCHED FROM THE INCEPTION OF THE STUDY UNTIL JANUARY 2016. ALL CLINICAL EVIDENCES THAT EVALUATE ANY TYPE OF YOGA AND ANY TYPE OF CONTROL IN INDIVIDUALS WITH ANY TYPE OF CONDITION WILL BE ELIGIBLE. THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY WILL BE ASSESSED USING THE COCHRANE RISK OF BIAS TOOL FOR RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS AND THE NEWCASTLE-OTTAWA SCALE FOR NONRANDOMIZED STUDIES. TWO AUTHORS WILL INDEPENDENTLY ASSESS EACH STUDY FOR ELIGIBILITY AND THE RISK OF BIAS, AND THEN THEY WILL EXTRACT THE DATA. WITH ITS EXTENSIVE, UNBIASED SEARCH OF THE KOREAN LITERATURE FROM VARIOUS DATABASES WITHOUT ANY LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS, THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WILL BE USEFUL FOR BOTH PRACTITIONERS IN THE FIELD OF YOGA RESEARCH AS WELL AS FOR PATIENTS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
9 1064  39 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON IMMUNE FUNCTION: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. OBJECTIVE: THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW ATTEMPTS TO CONFIRM THE ADDED EVIDENCE TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON IMMUNE FUNCTION. METHODS: THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, EMBASE, PSYCINFO, PUBMED, AND WEB OF SCIENCE ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE SEARCHED ACCORDING TO THE PRISRMA METHOD TO IDENTIFY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) ON THE IMMUNOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF YOGA PUBLISHED IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE FROM JANUARY 1, 2017, TO DECEMBER 31, 2020. THIS REVIEW COULD ONLY BE DESCRIPTIVELY SUMMARIZED BECAUSE OF HETEROGENEITY OF THE INCLUDED RCTS. RESULTS: ELEVEN POTENTIAL TRIALS WERE IDENTIFIED AND INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW. QUALITY APPRAISAL OF INCLUDED TRIALS RANGED FROM 3 FOR UNCLEAR RISK OF BIAS AND 8 FOR HIGH RISK OF BIAS. THERE IS EVIDENCE FROM 11 RCTS THAT YOGA MAY HAVE FAVORABLE EFFECTS FOR REDUCING THE LEVELS OF ANTI-INFLAMMATORY MARKERS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA MAY BE USED AS A COMPLEMENTARY INTERVENTION FOR CLINICAL POPULATIONS OR HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
10 1930  32 ROLE OF YOGA IN MANAGEMENT OF SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS: A NARRATIVE REVIEW. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS ARE COMPARABLE TO CHRONIC MEDICAL ILLNESSES AND HAVE A CHRONIC RELAPSING COURSE. DESPITE BEING SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTORS TO MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY, LIMITED TREATMENT OPTIONS EXIST. THE CURRENT NARRATIVE REVIEW WAS AIMED AT PROVIDING AN OVERVIEW OF YOGA THERAPY IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS AND DISCUSS THE RELEVANT METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES. ARTICLES PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE TILL MAY 2017 INDEXED WITH PUBMED, PUBMED CENTRAL, AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR WERE SEARCHED USING SEARCH TERMS "YOGA," "SUBSTANCE USE," "DRUG DEPENDENCE," "NICOTINE," "TOBACCO," "ALCOHOL," "OPIOIDS," "CANNABIS," "COCAINE," "STIMULANTS," "SEDATIVE HYPNOTICS," "INHALANTS," AND "HALLUCINOGENS" FOR INCLUSION IN THE REVIEW. A TOTAL OF 314 STUDIES WERE FOUND FULFILLING THE STATED CRITERIA. OUT OF WHICH, 16 STUDIES WERE FOUND TO FULFILL THE INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA AND 12 WERE RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS. THE MAJORITY OF STUDIES WERE AVAILABLE ON THE ROLE OF YOGA IN MANAGEMENT OF NICOTINE DEPENDENCE. SAMPLE SIZE OF THESE STUDIES RANGED FROM 18 TO 624. THE MAJORITY OF STUDIES SUGGESTED THE ROLE OF YOGA IN REDUCING SUBSTANCE USE AS WELL AS SUBSTANCE-RELATED CRAVING (ESPECIALLY IN NICOTINE-USE DISORDERS) IN SHORT TERM. HOWEVER, MORE STUDIES ARE REQUIRED FOR DEMONSTRATING THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDER.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
11 2130  37 THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA TO PREVENT DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2: A PROTOCOL FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM) IS BECOMING A LEADING PROBLEM WORLDWIDE. EMERGING REPORTS REVEAL ALARMING EVIDENCE OF INCREASING PREVALENCE OF T2DM THAT HAS REACHED PANDEMIC LEVELS. DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT INCIDENCE, THERE ARE LIMITED RELIABLE DATA RESOURCES AND COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PEOPLE WHO ARE A PREDIABETIC OR HIGH RISK FOR DEVELOPING T2DM. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROTOCOL IS TO CONDUCT A FULL-SCALE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSES ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PEOPLE WHO ARE PREDIABETES OR HIGH RISK OF DEVELOPING T2DM. METHODS: THE ARTICLES ENROLLED IN THE STUDY WILL BE RETRIEVED FROM THE ONLINE DATABASES BETWEEN 2002 AND THE DATE THE SEARCHES ARE EXECUTED. THE SEARCHES WILL BE REPEATED JUST BEFORE THE FINAL ANALYSES AND FURTHER RELEVANT STUDIES FOR INCLUSION. WE WILL CONDUCT A BIBLIOGRAPHIC SEARCH IN DATABASES: MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, COCHRANE LIBRARY, EBSCO, AND INDMED USING KEYWORDS INCLUDING PREDIABETES STATE, HIGH RISK FOR DIABETES, METABOLIC SYNDROME, AND YOGA. A DEFINED SEARCH STRATEGY WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ALONG WITH SELECTION CRITERIA TO OBTAIN FULL-TEXT ARTICLES OF RELEVANT STUDIES. THIS STUDY PROTOCOL WAS PREPARED ACCORDING TO THE PREFERRED REPORTING ITEMS FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND META-ANALYSIS FOR PROTOCOLS 2015 GUIDELINES. THERE WILL BE NO LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL BE BASED ON PUBLISHED STUDIES AND PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ANONYMIZED DATA WITHOUT DIRECTLY INVOLVING HUMAN PARTICIPANTS AND THEREFORE REQUIRES NEITHER FORMAL HUMAN ETHICAL REVIEW NOR APPROVAL BY A HUMAN RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEE. WE PUBLISHED AN OUTLINE OF THE PROTOCOL IN THE INTERNATIONAL PROSPECTIVE REGISTER OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS (PROSPERO) IN 2018. WE PLAN TO DISSEMINATE THE FINDINGS OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS THROUGH PUBLICATION IN A PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL AND PRESENTATION AT RELEVANT CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS. IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE THE RESULTS OF THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WILL HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND PRACTICE. WE WILL PREPARE POLICYMAKER SUMMARY USING A VALIDATED FORMAT, DISSEMINATE THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA AND EMAIL DISCUSSION GROUPS.

12  308  44 AN EVIDENCE MAP OF YOGA FOR LOW BACK PAIN. OBJECTIVE: YOGA IS BEING INCREASINGLY STUDIED AS A TREATMENT STRATEGY FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT CLINICAL CONDITIONS, INCLUDING LOW BACK PAIN (LBP). WE SET OUT TO CONDUCT AN EVIDENCE MAP OF YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT, PREVENTION AND RECURRENCE OF ACUTE OR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP). METHODS: WE SEARCHED MEDLINE, COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS, EMBASE, ALLIED AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE DATABASE AND CLINICALTRIALS.GOV FOR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCT), SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OR PLANNED STUDIES ON THE TREATMENT OR PREVENTION OF ACUTE BACK PAIN OR CLBP. TWO INDEPENDENT REVIEWERS SCREENED PAPERS FOR INCLUSION, EXTRACTED DATA AND ASSESSED THE QUALITY OF INCLUDED STUDIES. RESULTS: THREE ELIGIBLE SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS WERE IDENTIFIED THAT INCLUDED 10 RCTS (N=956) THAT EVALUATED YOGA FOR NON-SPECIFIC CLBP. WE DID NOT IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL RCTS BEYOND THOSE INCLUDED IN THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS. OUR SEARCH OF CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIED ONE SMALL (N=10) UNPUBLISHED TRIAL AND ONE LARGE (N=320) PLANNED CLINICAL TRIAL. THE MOST RECENT GOOD QUALITY SYSTEMATIC REVIEW INDICATED SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS FOR SHORT- AND LONG-TERM PAIN REDUCTION (N=6 TRIALS; STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE [SMD] -0.48; 95% CI, -0.65 TO -0.31; I(2)=0% AND N=5; SMD -0.33; 95% CI, -0.59 TO -0.07; I(2)=48%, RESPECTIVELY). LONG-TERM EFFECTS FOR BACK SPECIFIC DISABILITY WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED (N=5; SMD -0.35; 95% CI, -0.55 TO -0.15; I(2)=20%). NO STUDIES WERE IDENTIFIED EVALUATING YOGA FOR PREVENTION OR TREATMENT OF ACUTE LBP. CONCLUSION: EVIDENCE SUGGESTS BENEFIT OF YOGA IN MIDLIFE ADULTS WITH NON-SPECIFIC CLBP FOR SHORT- AND LONG-TERM PAIN AND BACK-SPECIFIC DISABILITY, BUT THE EFFECTS OF YOGA FOR HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, WELL- BEING AND ACUTE LBP ARE UNCERTAIN. WITHOUT ADDITIONAL STUDIES, FURTHER SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS ARE UNLIKELY TO BE INFORMATIVE.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
13  477  43 CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF YOGA FOR THE PEDIATRIC POPULATION: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EVIDENCE FOR CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF YOGA AMONG THE PEDIATRIC POPULATION. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED AN ELECTRONIC LITERATURE SEARCH INCLUDING CINAHL, COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL), EMBASE, MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, AND MANUAL SEARCH OF RETRIEVED ARTICLES FROM INCEPTION OF EACH DATABASE UNTIL DECEMBER 2008. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) AND NONRANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (NRCTS) WERE SELECTED THAT INCLUDED YOGA OR YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS AGED 0 TO 21 YEARS. DATA WERE EXTRACTED AND ARTICLES CRITICALLY REVIEWED USING A MODIFIED JADAD SCORE AND DESCRIPTIVE METHODOLOGICAL CRITERIA, WITH SUMMARIZATION IN TABLES. RESULTS: THIRTY-FOUR CONTROLLED STUDIES PUBLISHED FROM 1979 TO 2008 WERE IDENTIFIED, WITH 19 RCTS AND 15 NRCTS. MANY STUDIES WERE OF LOW METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY. CLINICAL AREAS FOR WHICH YOGA HAS BEEN STUDIED INCLUDE PHYSICAL FITNESS, CARDIORESPIRATORY EFFECTS, MOTOR SKILLS/STRENGTH, MENTAL HEALTH AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS, BEHAVIOR AND DEVELOPMENT, IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME, AND BIRTH OUTCOMES FOLLOWING PRENATAL YOGA. NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED IN TRIALS REVIEWED. ALTHOUGH A LARGE MAJORITY OF STUDIES WERE POSITIVE, METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS SUCH AS RANDOMIZATION METHODS, WITHDRAWAL/DROPOUTS, AND DETAILS OF YOGA INTERVENTION PRECLUDE CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE. CONCLUSIONS: THERE ARE LIMITED DATA ON THE CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF YOGA AMONG THE PEDIATRIC POPULATION. MOST PUBLISHED CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE SUGGESTIVE OF BENEFIT, BUT RESULTS ARE PRELIMINARY BASED ON LOW QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF TRIALS. FURTHER RESEARCH OF YOGA FOR CHILDREN BY USING A HIGHER STANDARD OF METHODOLOGY AND REPORTING IS WARRANTED.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
14 2171  40 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS AMONG PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM) IS A FASTEST EVOLVING METABOLIC DISORDER AND INDIA HOUSES SECOND HIGHEST NUMBER OF PATIENTS WITH DIABETES AFTER CHINA. CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES ARE THE MAJOR CAUSE OF MORTALITY AMONG PATIENTS WITH T2DM. YOGA IS AN ANCIENT INDIAN PRACTICE THAT PROVES TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR PATIENTS WITH DIABETES. THE PRESENT SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS HAS BEEN CONDUCTED TO SEE THE BENEFITS OF YOGA ON BLOOD PRESSURE, LIPID PROFILE, AND ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASURES AMONG PATIENTS WITH T2DM. THE ARTICLES WERE EXTRACTED FROM THREE DATABASES - PUBMED, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR. ONLY ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTICLES, WITH PEDRO SCORE>/=6, WERE INCLUDED IN THE CURRENT STUDY. THE DUPLICATES WERE REMOVED USING MENDELEY. FOURTEEN RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) AND THREE 3 NON-RCTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. THE META-ANALYSIS WAS DONE USING REVIEW MANAGER 5.3. THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT YOGA IS EFFECT IN IMPROVING BLOOD PRESSURE (P<0.01), LIPID PROFILE (P<0.01) EXCEPT HDL (P=0.06), AND ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASURES (P<0.01) EXCEPT WAIST-HIP RATIO (P=0.79). HETEROGENEITY WAS ALSO HIGH FOR MOST OF THE VARIABLES. IT MAY BE CONCLUDED FROM THE RESULTS THAT THE YOGA IS EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING OF BLOOD PRESSURE, LIPID PROFILE, AND ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASURES. HOWEVER, HIGH HETEROGENEITY SOUGHT THE NEED OF MORE HIGH QUALITY RCTS TO AFFIRM THESE FINDINGS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
15 2198  46 THE EFFICACY OF BODY-ORIENTED YOGA IN MENTAL DISORDERS-A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS BACKGROUND: THE EFFICACY OF BODY-ORIENTED YOGA IN THE TREATMENT OF MENTAL DISORDERS HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED IN NUMEROUS STUDIES. THIS ARTICLE IS A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF THE RELEVANT PUBLICATIONS. METHODS: ALL STUDIES IN WHICH THE EFFICACY OF HATHA-YOGA, I.E., BODY-ORIENTED YOGA WITH ASANAS AND PRANAYAMA, WAS STUDIED IN ADULT PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM A MENTAL DISORDER (AS DIAGNOSED BY ICD OR DSM CRITERIA) WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT WAS DISORDER-SPECIFIC SYMPTOM SEVERITY. THE PUBLICATIONS WERE IDENTIFIED BY A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH IN THE PUBMED, WEB OF SCIENCE, PSYCINFO AND PROQUEST DATABASES, SUPPLEMENTED BY A SEARCH WITH THE GOOGLE SCHOLAR SEARCH ENGINE AND A MANUAL SEARCH IN THE REFERENCE LISTS OF META-ANALYSES AND PRIMARY STUDIES, AS WELL AS IN SPECIALIZED JOURNALS. RESULTS: 25 STUDIES WITH A TOTAL OF 1339 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. A LARGE AND SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF YOGA WAS SEEN WITH RESPECT TO THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT (SYMPTOM SEVERITY) (HEDGES' G = 0.91; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [0.55; 1.28]; NUMBER NEEDED TO TREAT [NNT]: 2.03), WITH SUBSTANTIAL HETEROGENEITY (I2 = 69.8%) COMPARED TO UNTREATED CONTROL GROUPS. SMALL BUT SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS OF YOGA WERE ALSO SEEN IN COMPARISON WITH ATTENTION CONTROL (G = 0.39; [0.04; 0.73]; NNT: 4.55) AND PHYSICAL EXERCISE (G = 0.30; [0.01; 0.59]; NNT: 5.75); NO DIFFERENCE IN EFFICACY WAS FOUND BETWEEN YOGA AND STANDARD PSYCHOTHERAPY (G = 0.08; [-0.24; 0,40]; NNT: 21.89). IN VIEW OF THE RELATIVELY HIGH RISK OF BIAS, THESE FINDINGS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION. CONCLUSION: BODY-ORIENTED YOGA WITH ASANAS AND PRANAYAMA AS CENTRAL COMPONENTS IS A PROMISING COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR MENTAL DISORDERS AND SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED IN FURTHER HIGH-QUALITY STUDIES.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
16 1101  47 EFFECTS OF YOGA TRAINING IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. INTRODUCTION: CURRENTLY, SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE ASSESSED THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON THE MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD), BUT THESE STUDIES INVOLVED A WIDE VARIATION OF SAMPLE AND CONVEY INCONCLUSIVE RESULTS. HENCE, THE PRESENT STUDY WAS PERFORMED A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA TRAINING IN COPD PATIENTS. METHODS: PUBMED, EMBASE, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, GOOGLE SCHOLAR, AND CLINICALTRIALS.GOV DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR RELEVANT STUDIES. THE PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN ONE SECOND (FEV1), FEV1% PREDICTED (% PRED). SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED 6-MIN WALKING DISTANCE (6 MWD), ARTERIAL OXYGEN TENSION (PAO2), AND ARTERIAL CARBON DIOXIDE TENSION (PACO2). WEIGHTED MEAN DIFFERENCES (WMDS) AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CIS) WERE CALCULATED, AND HETEROGENEITY WAS ASSESSED WITH THE I(2) TEST. RESULTS: FIVE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) INVOLVING 233 PATIENTS FULFILLED THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. YOGA TRAINING SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED FEV1 (WMD: 123.57 ML, 95% CI: 4.12-243, P=0.04), FEV1% PRED (WMD: 3.90%, 95% CI: 2.27-5.54, P<0.00001), AND 6 MWD (WMD: 38.84 M, 95% CI: 15.52-62.16, P=0.001). HOWEVER, YOGA TRAINING HAD NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON PAO2 (WMD: 1.29 MMHG, 95% CI: -1.21-3.78, P=0.31) AND PACO2 (WMD: -0.76 MMHG, 95% CI: -2.06-0.53, P=0.25). CONCLUSIONS: THE CURRENT LIMITED EVIDENCE SUGGESTED THAT YOGA TRAINING HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON IMPROVING LUNG FUNCTION AND EXERCISE CAPACITY AND COULD BE USED AS AN ADJUNCT PULMONARY REHABILITATION PROGRAM IN COPD PATIENTS. HOWEVER, FURTHER STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO SUBSTANTIATE OUR PRELIMINARY FINDINGS AND TO INVESTIGATE THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA TRAINING.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
17 1055  37 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CHRONIC NECK PAIN: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. [PURPOSE] THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC NECK PAIN. [SUBJECTS AND METHODS] FIVE ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE SEARCHED TO IDENTIFY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON CHRONIC NECK PAIN. THE TRIALS WERE PUBLISHED IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE BETWEEN JANUARY 1966 AND DECEMBER 2015. THE COCHRANE RISK OF BIAS TOOL WAS USED TO ASSESS THE QUALITY OF THE TRIALS. [RESULTS] THREE TRIALS WERE IDENTIFIED AND INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW. A CRITICAL APPRAISAL WAS PERFORMED ON THE TRIALS, AND THE RESULT INDICATED A HIGH RISK OF BIAS. A NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION WAS PROCESSED BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF RCTS. NECK PAIN INTENSITY AND FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN THE YOGA GROUPS THAN IN THE CONTROL GROUPS. [CONCLUSION] EVIDENCE FROM THE 3 RANDOMLY CONTROLLED TRIALS SHOWS THAT YOGA MAY BE BENEFICIAL FOR CHRONIC NECK PAIN. THE LOW-QUALITY RESULT OF THE CRITICAL APPRAISAL AND THE SMALL NUMBER OF TRIALS SUGGEST THAT HIGH-QUALITY RCTS ARE REQUIRED TO EXAMINE FURTHER THE EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON CHRONIC NECK PAIN RELIEF.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
18  834  51 EFFECT OF YOGA ON OXIDATIVE STRESS IN TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: DIABETES MELLITUS HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PUBLIC HEALTH. OXIDATIVE STRESS PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE IN THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM), LEADING TO VARIOUS COMPLICATIONS OF T2DM. YOGA IS BEING WIDELY USED IN THE MANAGEMENT OF T2DM. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS IS TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON OXIDATIVE STRESS PARAMETERS AMONG ADULT PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH T2DM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ELECTRONIC DATABASES SUCH AS PUBMED, SCOPUS, COCHRANE LIBRARY AND SCIENCE DIRECT FROM START OF THE STUDY TILL MARCH 2020 WERE SEARCHED TO OBTAIN ELIGIBLE STUDIES. STUDY DESIGNS OF ALL NATURE WERE INCLUDED (EXCEPT CASE STUDIES AND REVIEWS). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS MALONDIALDEHYDE (MDA) AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE, HBA1C AND SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE (SOD) LEVELS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF FOUR TRIALS WITH A TOTAL OF 440 PATIENTS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. THE RESULTS OF META-ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED MDA (SMD: -1.4; 95% CI -2.66 TO -0.13; P = 0.03; I2 = 97%), FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE LEVELS (SMD: -1.87: 95% CI -3.83 TO -0.09; P = 0.06; I2= 99%), AND HBA1C (SMD: -1.92; 95% CI - 3.03 TO -0.81; P = 0.0007; I2 = 92%) IN PATIENTS WITH T2DM. NO SUCH EFFECT WAS FOUND FOR SOD (SMD: -1.01; 95% CI -4.41 TO 2.38; P = 0.56; I2= 99%). CONCLUSION: THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT YOGA REDUCES MDA, FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE AND HBA1C, AND THUS WOULD BE BENEFICIAL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF T2DM AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY. HOWEVER, CONSIDERING THE LIMITED NUMBER OF STUDIES AND ITS HETEROGENEITY, FURTHER ROBUST STUDIES ARE NECESSARY TO STRENGTHEN OUR FINDINGS AND INVESTIGATE THE LONG-TERM BENEFITS OF YOGA.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
19 1689  30 OVERVIEW OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS: YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION FOR ADULTS WITH ACUTE AND CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS. OBJECTIVES. OVERVIEW THE QUALITY, DIRECTION, AND CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR TREATMENT OF ACUTE AND CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS IN ADULT POPULATIONS. METHODS. WE SEARCHED FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS IN 10 ONLINE DATABASES, BIBLIOGRAPHIC REFERENCES, AND HAND-SEARCHES IN YOGA-RELATED JOURNALS. INCLUDED REVIEWS SATISFY OXMAN CRITERIA AND SPECIFY YOGA AS A PRIMARY INTERVENTION IN ONE OR MORE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS FOR TREATMENT IN ADULTS. THE AMSTAR TOOL AND GRADE APPROACH EVALUATED THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF REVIEWS AND QUALITY OF EVIDENCE. RESULTS. WE IDENTIFIED 2202 TITLES, OF WHICH 41 FULL-TEXT ARTICLES WERE ASSESSED FOR ELIGIBILITY AND 26 SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS SATISFIED INCLUSION CRITERIA. THIRTEEN SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS INCLUDE QUANTITATIVE DATA AND SIX PAPERS INCLUDE META-ANALYSIS. THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE IS GENERALLY LOW. SIXTEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF HEALTH CONDITIONS ARE INCLUDED. ELEVEN REVIEWS SHOW TENDENCY TOWARDS POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTION, 15 REVIEWS REPORT UNCLEAR RESULTS, AND NO, REVIEWS REPORT ADVERSE EFFECTS OF YOGA. YOGA APPEARS MOST EFFECTIVE FOR REDUCING SYMPTOMS IN ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND PAIN. CONCLUSION. ALTHOUGH THE QUALITY OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS IS HIGH, THE QUALITY OF SUPPORTING EVIDENCE IS LOW. SIGNIFICANT HETEROGENEITY AND VARIABILITY IN REPORTING INTERVENTIONS BY TYPE OF YOGA, SETTINGS, AND POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS LIMIT THE GENERALIZABILITY OF RESULTS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
20  590  45 DETERMINING THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA IN CHRONIC STROKE CARE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: SURVIVORS OF STROKE HAVE LONG-TERM PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES THAT IMPACT THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE. FEW INTERVENTIONS ARE AVAILABLE IN THE COMMUNITY TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS. YOGA, A TYPE OF MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTION, IS SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN PEOPLE WITH OTHER CHRONIC ILLNESSES AND MAY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE PROBLEMS REPORTED BY SURVIVORS OF STROKE. OBJECTIVES: TO DATE ONLY NARRATIVE REVIEWS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED. WE SOUGHT TO PERFORM, THE FIRST SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WITH META-ANALYSES OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) THAT INVESTIGATED YOGA FOR ITS POTENTIAL BENEFIT FOR CHRONIC SURVIVORS OF STROKE. METHODS: OVID MEDLINE, CINHAL PLUS, AMED, PUBMED, PSYCHINFO, PEDRO, COCHRANE DATABASE, SPORT DISCUSS, AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR WERE SEARCHED FOR PAPERS PUBLISHED BETWEEN JANUARY 1950 AND AUGUST 2016. REFERENCE LISTS OF INCLUDED PAPERS, REVIEW ARTICLES AND OPENGREY FOR GREY LITERATURE WERE ALSO SEARCHED. WE USED A MODIFIED COCHRANE TOOL TO EVALUATE RISK OF BIAS. THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF RCTS WAS ASSESSED USING THE GRADE APPROACH, RESULTS WERE COLLATED, AND RANDOM EFFECTS META-ANALYSES PERFORMED WHERE APPROPRIATE. RESULTS: THE SEARCH YIELDED FIVE ELIGIBLE PAPERS FROM FOUR RCTS WITH SMALL SAMPLE SIZES (N = 17-47). QUALITY OF RCTS WAS RATED AS LOW TO MODERATE. YOGA IS BENEFICIAL IN REDUCING STATE ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND DEPRESSION IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP (MEAN DIFFERENCES FOR STATE ANXIETY 6.05, 95% CI:-0.02 TO 12.12; P = 0.05 AND STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCES FOR DEPRESSION: 0.50, 95% CI:-0.01 TO 1.02; P = 0.05). CONSISTENT BUT NONSIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE DEMONSTRATED FOR BALANCE, TRAIT ANXIETY, AND OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA MAY BE EFFECTIVE FOR AMELIORATING SOME OF THE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES OF STROKE. LARGE WELL-DESIGNED RCTS ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE FINDINGS.	2017

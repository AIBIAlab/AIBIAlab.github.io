1 1396 85 IMPACT OF YOGA IN A CASE OF VOCAL CORD DYSFUNCTION WITH DYSAUTONOMIA. A 23-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH A PAST MEDICAL HISTORY OF GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE PRESENTED WITH SHORTNESS OF BREATH INDUCED BY EXERCISE AND CERTAIN ODORS. SHE REPORTED THE SYMPTOMS OF AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION INCLUDING FATIGUE, CHEST PAIN, LIGHTHEADEDNESS, HEADACHES, NUMBNESS/TINGLING IN THE ARMS AND LEGS, AND EXERCISE INTOLERANCE. VITAL SIGNS WERE SIGNIFICANT FOR ORTHOSTATIC INTOLERANCE. VOLUME FLOW LOOP IN THE PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS SHOWED A FLATTENING OF THE INSPIRATORY PORTION CHARACTERISTIC OF VOCAL CORD DYSFUNCTION. LARYNGOSCOPY SHOWED DYSKINESIA OF THE LEFT VOCAL CORD, ESPECIALLY AFTER EXERCISE. MULTIFACTORIAL APPROACH WAS USED INCLUDING INCREASED FLUID INTAKE AND BREATHING EXERCISES. AFTER 6 WEEKS OF BREATHING AND ISOMETRIC EXERCISES, THE PATIENT REPORTED IMPROVEMENT IN DYSPNEA AFTER EXERCISE. THIS CASE REPORT DEMONSTRATES THE THERAPEUTIC ROLE OF BREATHING AND ISOMETRIC EXERCISES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF VOCAL CORD AND AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
2 2552 22 YOGA FOR CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY AND FALL RISK: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY (CIPN) IS A COMMON, DEBILITATING SIDE EFFECT THAT WORSENS QUALITY OF LIFE AND INCREASES THE RISK OF FALLS IN CANCER SURVIVORS. EVIDENCE OF YOGA'S SAFETY AND EFFICACY IN TREATING CIPN IS LACKING. METHODS: IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY, WE ASSIGNED BREAST AND GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER SURVIVORS WITH PERSISTENT MODERATE-TO-SEVERE CIPN PAIN, NUMBNESS, OR TINGLING WITH A SCORE OF 4 OR GREATER (0-10 NUMERIC RATING SCALE [NRS]) FOR AT LEAST 3 MONTHS AFTER CHEMOTHERAPY TO 8 WEEKS OF USUAL CARE OR YOGA FOCUSED ON BREATHWORK AND MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONING. PRIMARY ENDPOINT WAS TREATMENT ARM DIFFERENCES FOR NRS, AND SECONDARY ENDPOINTS WERE FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CANCER THERAPY/GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY GROUP-NEUROTOXICITY SUBSCALE (FACT/GOG-NTX), AND FUNCTIONAL REACH TEST AFTER WEEK 8. WE TESTED TREATMENT ARM DIFFERENCES FOR EACH OUTCOME MEASURE USING LINEAR MIXED MODELS WITH TREATMENT-BY-TIME INTERACTIONS. ALL STATISTICAL TESTS WERE TWO-SIDED. RESULTS: WE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED 41 PARTICIPANTS INTO YOGA (N = 21) OR USUAL CARE (N = 20). AT WEEK 8, MEAN NRS PAIN DECREASED BY 1.95 POINTS (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI] = -3.20 TO -0.70) IN YOGA VS 0.65 (95% CI = -1.81 TO 0.51) IN USUAL CARE (P = .14). FACT/GOG-NTX IMPROVED BY 4.25 (95% CI = 2.29 TO 6.20) IN YOGA VS 1.36 (95% CI = -0.47 TO 3.19) IN USUAL CARE (P = .035). FUNCTIONAL REACH, AN OBJECTIVE FUNCTIONAL MEASURE PREDICTING THE RISK OF FALLS, IMPROVED BY 7.14 CM (95% CI = 3.68 TO 10.59) IN YOGA AND DECREASED BY 1.65 CM (95% CI = -5.00 TO 1.72) IN USUAL CARE (P = .001). FOUR GRADE 1 ADVERSE EVENTS WERE OBSERVED IN THE YOGA ARM. CONCLUSION: AMONG BREAST AND GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER SURVIVORS WITH MODERATE-TO-SEVERE CIPN, YOGA WAS SAFE AND SHOWED PROMISING EFFICACY IN IMPROVING CIPN SYMPTOMS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
3 2914 17 [SPONTANOUS PNEUMOMEDIASTINUM AFTER YOGA PRACTICE - A CASE REPORT]. PNEUMOMEDIASTINUM IS DEFINED AS INTERSTITIAL AIR IN THE MEDIASTINUM, WITHOUT ANY APPARENT PRECIPATING FACTOR SUCH AS TRAUMA, OESOPHAGEAL PERFORATION OR INFECTIONS. IT IS VERY UNCOMMON AND USUALLY AFFECTS YOUNG OTHERWISE HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS. THE MOST COMMON SYMTOMS ARE CHEST PAIN AND DYSPNEA WITH SUBCUTANEOUS EMPHYSEMA FOUND ON EXAMINATION. TREATMENT IS USUALLY CONSERVATIVE WITH PAIN RELIEF. HERE, WE PRESENT AN UNUSUAL CASE OF A 23-YEAR-OLD PREVIOUSLY HEALTHY MALE WHO WAS DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMOMEDIASTINUM AFTER PRACTISING YOGA. THIS CASE DEMONSTRATES THE NEED TO STUDY PATIENTS WITH CHEST PAIN OF UNKNOWN CAUSE IN DETAILS TO FIND CAUSES.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
4 1389 18 IMPACT OF SOMATIC YOGA AND MEDITATION ON FALL RISK, FUNCTION, AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY SYNDROME IN CANCER SURVIVORS. OBJECTIVE: CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY (CIPN) SYNDROME CAUSES SIGNIFICANT PAIN AS AN ADVERSE EFFECT OF TREATMENT, WITH FEW NONPHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS TESTED. A SOMATIC YOGA AND MEDITATION (SYM) INTERVENTION ON FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) WAS INVESTIGATED. DESIGN AND METHODS: INDIVIDUALS DIAGNOSED WITH CIPN WERE ENROLLED IN AN OPEN-LABEL, SINGLE-ARM, MIXED-METHODS FEASIBILITY TRIAL. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: IN AN OUTPATIENT REHABILITATION CENTER, TEN PARTICIPANTS WITH MEDIAN AGE 64.4 YEARS (47-81) ATTENDED 61% OF THE SESSIONS WITH NO ADVERSE EVENTS. INTERVENTION: SYM TWICE A WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS FOR 1.5 HOURS, WITH HOME PROGRAM AND JOURNALING. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PRIMARY FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES INCLUDED SIT AND REACH (SR), FUNCTIONAL REACH (FR), AND TIMED UP AND GO (TUG). SELF-REPORTED PATIENT NEUROTOXICITY QUESTIONNAIRE (PNQ) AND FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CANCER THERAPY-NEUROTOXICITY (FACT-GOG-NTX) WERE SECONDARY CIPN OUTCOMES. BIOMARKERS INCLUDED SALIVARY CORTISOL (STRESS) AND BIOESTHESIOMETER (VIBRATION). RESULTS: QUANTITATIVE FINDINGS. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE FOUND IN FLEXIBILITY (SR; P = .006); BALANCE (FR; P = .001) AND FALL RISK (TUG; P = .004). PNQ IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY ( P = .003) WITH OTHER MEASURES IMPROVING NON-SIGNIFICANTLY. QUALITATIVE FINDINGS. FIVE THEMES EMERGED: (1) VACILLATION OF CIPN PAIN PERCEPTION OVER TIME; (2) TRANSFERABILITY OF SKILLS TO DAILY ACTIVITIES; (3) IMPROVEMENT IN PHYSICAL FUNCTION; (4) PERCEIVED RELAXATION AS AN EFFECT OF SYM; AND (5) GROUP ENGAGEMENT PROVIDED A SOCIAL CONTEXT FOR NOT FEELING ISOLATED WITH CIPN. CONCLUSION: PRELIMINARY DATA SUGGEST SYM MAY IMPROVE QOL, FLEXIBILITY, AND BALANCE IN CANCER SURVIVORS WITH CIPN, WITH A FULLY POWERED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL INDICATED.

5 2549 16 YOGA FOR CANCER SURVIVORS WITH CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY: HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS A MEDITATIVE MOVEMENT THERAPY FOCUSED ON MIND-BODY AWARENESS. THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) OUTCOMES IN PATIENTS WITH CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY (CIPN) IS UNCLEAR. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A PILOT RANDOMIZED WAIT-LIST CONTROLLED TRIAL OF 8 WEEKS OF YOGA (N = 21) VERSUS WAIT-LIST CONTROL (N = 20) FOR CIPN IN 41 BREAST AND GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER SURVIVORS WITH PERSISTENT MODERATE TO SEVERE CIPN. HRQOL ENDPOINTS WERE HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE (HADS), BRIEF FATIGUE INVENTORY (BFI), AND INSOMNIA SEVERITY INDEX (ISI). THE TREATMENT EXPECTANCY SCALE (TES) WAS ADMINISTERED AT BASELINE. WE ESTIMATED MEAN CHANGES AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CIS) FROM BASELINE TO WEEKS 8 AND 12 AND COMPARED ARMS USING CONSTRAINED LINEAR MIXED MODELS. RESULTS: AT WEEK 8, HADS ANXIETY SCORES DECREASED -1.61 (-2.75, -0.46) IN THE YOGA ARM AND -0.32 (-1.38, 0.75) POINTS IN THE WAIT-LIST CONTROL ARM (P = 0.099). AT WEEK 12, HADS ANXIETY SCORES DECREASED -1.42 (-2.57, -0.28) IN YOGA COMPARED TO AN INCREASE OF 0.46 (-0.60, 1.53) IN WAIT-LIST CONTROL (P = 0.017). THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN HADS DEPRESSION, BFI, OR ISI SCORES BETWEEN YOGA AND WAIT-LIST CONTROL. BASELINE TES WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN YOGA THAN IN WAIT-LIST CONTROL (14.9 VS. 12.7, P = 0.019). TES WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH HADS ANXIETY REDUCTION AND HADS ANXIETY REDUCTION WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH CIPN PAIN REDUCTION. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA MAY REDUCE ANXIETY IN PATIENTS WITH CIPN. FUTURE STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE FINDINGS.

6  916 20 EFFECTIVENESS OF SOMATIC YOGA AND MEDITATION: A PILOT STUDY IN A MULTICULTURAL CANCER SURVIVOR POPULATION WITH CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY. CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY (CIPN) CAUSES SIGNIFICANT PAIN AND IS AN ADVERSE EFFECT OF TREATMENT WITH CHEMOTHERAPEUTIC AGENTS. WE EXPLORED A SOMATIC YOGA AND MEDITATION INTERVENTION IN A PREDOMINANTLY MINORITY POPULATION. GOALS INCLUDED DESCRIBING STRATEGIES FOR MINORITY INCLUSION AND TESTING FEASIBILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS. EIGHT INDIVIDUALS WITH CIPN ENROLLED IN A SINGLE-ARM FEASIBILITY TRIAL. SOMATIC YOGA AND MEDITATION WERE PROVIDED WEEKLY FOR 8 WEEKS, WITH AN ADDITIONAL HOME PROGRAM COMPONENT. THE PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE SIT AND REACH, FUNCTIONAL REACH, AND TIMED UP AND GO. SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE PATIENT NEUROTOXICITY QUESTIONNAIRE, FACT-GOG-NTX (FOR ADDRESSING PATIENT CONCERNS ASSOCIATED WITH NEUROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS), BRIEF PAIN INVENTORY, PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE, PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX, AND FALLS EFFICACY SCALE. SENSITIVITY TO VIBRATION WAS MEASURED VIA BIOTHESIOMETER. PARTICIPANTS WITH A MEAN AGE OF 65 (49-73) YEARS SELF-REPORTED AS 63% AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND 37% CAUCASIAN. THEY ATTENDED 81% OF THE SESSIONS, AND NO ADVERSE EVENTS WE RE RE P O RTED. CIPN SYMPTOMS (FAC T- G O G - N T X ) IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY (FROM 88.88 TO 106.88, STANDARD DEVIATION = 20.03; P = 0.039). FEAR OF FALLING IMPROVED, APPROACHING SIGNIFICANCE (FROM 39.26 TO 34.38, STANDARD DEVIATION = 6.081; P = 0.058). OTHER MEASURES SHOWED IMPROVEMENT TRENDS, WITH A SLIGHT INCREASE IN BRIEF PAIN INVENTORY PAIN SEVERITY (FROM 3.50 TO 3.75, P = 0.041) POSSIBLY REFLECTING COMORBIDITIES. FOUR QUALITATIVE THEMES EMERGED: (1) CIPN SYMPTOM VARIABILITY, WITH MUSCULOSKELETAL COMORBIDITIES; (2) UTILITY OF LEARNED SKILLS; (3) IMPROVEMENT IN SELF-CONFIDENCE, BALANCE, AND STABILITY; AND (4) SOCIAL SUPPORT, WITH CIPN EXPERIENCE VALIDATION AND INCREASING HEALTH LITERACY. CHALLENGES OF RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION REQUIRE SPECIFIC OUTREACH, COMMUNITY TRUST, AND HEALTH LITERACY. PRELIMINARY DATA SUGGEST THAT SOMATIC YOGA AND MEDITATION MAY AFFECT FEAR OF FALLING AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN CANCER SURVIVORS WITH CIPN. A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL USING INCLUSIVE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION METHODS IS INDICATED TO ESTABLISH THE INTERVENTION'S EFFICACY.	2020	
                                                                                                                  
7  776 20 EFFECT OF YOGA AND NATUROPATHY-BASED LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION ON LEFT VENTRICULAR EJECTION FRACTION IN A PATIENT WITH SEVERE TRIPLE VESSEL DISEASE: A CASE REPORT. A 75-YEAR-OLD, MARRIED MAN WAS DIAGNOSED WITH CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD) [SEVERE TRIPLE VESSEL DISEASE (TVD)] IN THE 2(ND) WEEK, JUNE-2018. THE PHYSICIAN ADVISED HIM TO UNDERGO CONVENTIONAL MEDICATION AND CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT. SINCE THE PATIENT REFUSED TO UNDERGO SURGERY HE WAS ADMITTED IN OUR HOSPITAL AND UNDERWENT YOGA AND NATUROPATHY-BASED LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION (YNLM) ALONG WITH CONVENTIONAL MEDICINES FOR 16 WEEKS [12 WEEKS OF INTENSIVE CARE AT INPATIENT DEPARTMENT AND 4 WEEKS AT OUTPATIENT DEPARTMENT (OPD)]. AFTER 16 WEEKS, THE PATIENT VISITED OUR OPD ONCE/TWICE A MONTH FOR 6 MONTHS. AN INCREASE IN LEFT VENTRICULAR EJECTION FRACTION FROM 35 TO 48%; AND A REDUCTION IN WEIGHT FROM 77.5 TO 71-KG, AND BMI FROM 26.60 TO 24-KG/M(2) WERE OBSERVED AFTER 6 MONTHS OF FOLLOW-UP COMPARED WITH BASELINE. THUS, YNLM MIGHT BE CONSIDERED AS AN ADJUVANT IN REDUCING RISK FACTOR AND IN IMPROVING LEFT VENTRICULAR SYSTOLIC DYSFUNCTION IN PATIENTS WITH CAD (SEVERE-TVD). HOWEVER, FURTHER STUDIES ARE REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH THE EFFICACY OF YNLM FOR CAD.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
8  885 16 EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON REACTION TIME, RESPIRATORY ENDURANCE AND MUSCLE STRENGTH. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE PRACTICE OF YOGA IMPROVES PHYSICAL AND MENTAL PERFORMANCE. THE PRESENT INVESTIGATION WAS UNDERTAKEN TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON VISUAL AND AUDITORY REACTION TIMES (RTS), MAXIMUM EXPIRATORY PRESSURE (MEP), MAXIMUM INSPIRATORY PRESSURE (MIP), 40 MMHG TEST, BREATH HOLDING TIME AFTER EXPIRATION (BHTEXP), BREATH HOLDING TIME AFTER INSPIRATION (BHTINSP), AND HAND GRIP STRENGTH (HGS). TWENTY SEVEN STUDENT VOLUNTEERS WERE GIVEN YOGA TRAINING FOR 12 WEEKS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.001) DECREASE IN VISUAL RT (FROM 270.0 +/- 6.20 (SE) TO 224.81 +/- 5.76 MS) AS WELL AS AUDITORY RT (FROM 194.18 +/- 6.00 TO 157.33 +/- 4.85 MS). MEP INCREASED FROM 92.61 +/- 9.04 TO 126.46 +/- 10.75 MMHG, WHILE MIP INCREASED FROM 72.23 +/- 6.45 TO 90.92 +/- 6.03 MMHG, BOTH THESE CHANGES BEING STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.05). 40 MMHG TEST AND HGS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (P < 0.001) FROM 36.57 +/- 2.04 TO 53.36 +/- 3.95 S AND 13.78 +/- 0.58 TO 16.67 +/- 0.49 KG RESPECTIVELY. BHTEXP INCREASED FROM 32.15 +/- 1.41 TO 44.53 +/- 3.78S (P < 0.01) AND BHTINSP INCREASED FROM 63.69 +/- 5.38 TO 89.07 +/- 9.61 S (P < 0.05). OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT YOGA PRACTICE FOR 12 WEEKS RESULTS IN SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN VISUAL AND AUDITORY RTS AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN RESPIRATORY PRESSURES, BREATH HOLDING TIMES AND HGS.	1992	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
9  443 26 CERVICAL ARTERIAL DISSECTION AND TRAUMATIC MYELOPATHY FOLLOWING YOGA: SURGICAL CASE REPORT. INTRODUCTION: CERVICAL SPONDYLOSIS CAN PREDISPOSE PATIENTS TO CENTRAL CANAL STENOSIS. IN THIS SETTING, MYELOPATHY THROUGH FURTHER FLATTENING OF THE CORD FROM EXTRINSIC COMPRESSION CAN BE PRECIPITATED BY RELATIVELY MINOR TRAUMAS. ARTERIAL DISSECTION IS SIMILARLY CONSIDERED A RESULT OF HIGH VELOCITY OR MOMENTUM DURING TRAUMA, COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH FRACTURES, CERVICAL HYPERFLEXION, OR DIRECT BLUNT FORCE TO THE NECK. OVERALL, PRECAUTIONS FOR BOTH ARTERIAL DISSECTION AND MYELOPATHY ARE RARELY CONSIDERED IN LOW-VELOCITY, STATIC ACTIVITIES SUCH AS YOGA. CASE PRESENTATION: THE AUTHORS REPORT THE CASE OF A 63-YEAR-OLD MAN WHO SUFFERED CONCURRENT CERVICAL MYELOPATHY FROM MULTILEVEL SPONDYLOPATHY, RIGHT VERTEBRAL ARTERY DISSECTION, AND LEFT CERVICAL CAROTID ARTERY DISSECTION FOLLOWING A YOGA SESSION. SYMPTOMATOLOGY CONSISTED OF ACUTE ONSET NECK PAIN, UPPER EXTREMITY SENSORY PARESTHESIA, WORSENING GAIT AND BALANCE, AND IMPAIRED DEXTERITY FOR SEVERAL WEEKS. CERVICAL MRI WAS OBTAINED GIVEN MYELOPATHIC SYMPTOMS AND REVEALED SPONDYLOSIS WITH COMPRESSION AND T2 SIGNAL CHANGE AT C3-C4. CT ANGIOGRAPHY OF THE NECK REVEALED AFOREMENTIONED DISSECTIONS WITHOUT FLOW LIMITING STENOSIS OR OCCLUSION. A THERAPEUTIC HEPARIN INFUSION WAS STARTED PREOPERATIVELY UNTIL THE PATIENT UNDERWENT C3-C4 ANTERIOR CERVICAL DISCECTOMY AND FUSION. ASPIRIN AND PLAVIX WERE THEN STARTED WITHOUT INCIDENCE AND THE PATIENT HAD SIGNIFICANT BUT GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT IN MYELOPATHIC SYMPTOMS AT 6-WEEK FOLLOW-UP. DISCUSSION: THE STATIC YET INTENSIVE POSES ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA PRESENT A RARE ETIOLOGY FOR ARTERIAL DISSECTION AND MYELOPATHY, BUT PATIENTS WITH PERSISTENT AND PROGRESSIVE SYMPTOMS SHOULD BE SCREENED WITH THE APPROPRIATE IMAGING MODALITY. CERVICAL DECOMPRESSION SHOULD BE EXPEDITED BEFORE INITIATING AN ANTIPLATELET MEDICATION.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
10  573 12 DELAYED UNION OF STRESS FRACTURE OF THE FIRST RIB IN A YOGA INSTRUCTOR: A CASE REPORT. CASE: WE DESCRIBE THE CASE OF A 38-YEAR-OLD WOMAN, A YOGA INSTRUCTOR, WHO HAD PAIN IN THE RIGHT SHOULDER AND SCAPULAR REGION OF 4 MONTHS' DURATION WHILE PERFORMING YOGA. RADIOGRAPHY AND COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY DIAGNOSED DELAYED UNION OF A FIRST RIB STRESS FRACTURE. THE DELAYED UNION OF STRESS FRACTURE OF THE FIRST RIB WAS SUCCESSFULLY TREATED WITH THE LIMITING OF YOGA ACTIVITY AND LOW-INTENSITY PULSED ULTRASOUND (LIPUS). CONCLUSIONS: PHYSICIANS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT EVEN YOGA POSING CAN CAUSE STRESS FRACTURES OF THE FIRST RIB. LIPUS THERAPY MAY BE EFFECTIVE FOR DELAYED UNION IN ADDITION TO REST.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
11 2557 23 YOGA FOR CHRONIC CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY PAIN: A PILOT, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. PURPOSE: TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR CANCER SURVIVORS WITH CHRONIC CIPN PAIN, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF THE INTERVENTION ON PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES. METHODS: CANCER SURVIVORS WITH CHRONIC CIPN PAIN WERE RECRUITED FROM THE BREAST, GASTROINTESTINAL, AND GYNECOLOGICAL ONCOLOGY CENTERS AT DANA-FARBER CANCER INSTITUTE. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED (2:1) TO RECEIVE AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION OR USUAL CARE. AFTER 21/50 OF PARTICIPANTS WERE ENROLLED, THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC REQUIRED THE YOGA INTERVENTION TO BE DELIVERED VIRTUALLY (I.E., ZOOM). PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION, PARTICIPANTS SELF-REPORTED CIPN AND CO-OCCURRING SYMPTOM SEVERITY. ADHERENCE TO THE INTERVENTION WAS DEFINED AS PRACTICING >/= 12 YOGA SESSIONS OVER THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION PERIOD. CHANGES IN PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES BETWEEN GROUPS WERE COMPARED USING WILCOXON'S RANK-SUM TESTS. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS (N = 28 YOGA, N = 16 CONTROL) WERE MAINLY FEMALE (96%) AND DIAGNOSED WITH STAGE III/IV DISEASE (66%). OVERALL, 19/28 (67.8%) OF YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS WERE ADHERENT TO THE YOGA PROTOCOL. YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT WITHIN-GROUP IMPROVEMENTS IN ALL PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES, INCLUDING WORST CIPN PAIN (MEDIAN CHANGE = - 1.7, P < 0.0001) AND SENSORY CIPN (MEDIAN CHANGE = - 14.8, P < 0.0001), BUT ONLY IMPROVEMENTS IN FATIGUE (P = 0.05) AND DEPRESSION (P = 0.04) WERE SIGNIFICANT COMPARED TO THE CONTROL. THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES (P > 0.05) IN CHANGES IN PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES BETWEEN IN-PERSON (N = 6) OR VIRTUAL (N = 15) YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA IS A FEASIBLE NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL MODALITY FOR CANCER SURVIVORS WITH CIPN, BUT MORE INFORMATION IS NEEDED REGARDING ITS IMPACT ON CIPN AND OTHER SYMPTOMS. TRIAL REGISTRATION: CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT03824860 IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: ONCOLOGY CLINICIANS MAY CONSIDER REFERRING CANCER SURVIVORS TO YOGA FOR CHRONIC CIPN PAIN, BUT YOGA CANNOT BE CURRENTLY RECOMMENDED AS AN EFFICACIOUS TREATMENT.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
12 2049 21 THE APPLICATION OF "UPPER-BODY YOGA" IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH ACUTE HIP FRACTURE: A PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, AND SINGLE-BLIND STUDY. PURPOSES: HIP FRACTURE LEADS TO DECREASED ACTIVITY AND AN INCREASED RISK OF PULMONARY COMPLICATIONS. THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO OBSERVE THE LUNG CAPACITY, COUGH CAPACITY OF THE ELDERLY PATIENT WITH ACUTE HIP FRACTURE, AND ASSESS THE EFFECTS AND THE FEASIBILITY OF USING A SPECIAL-DESIGNED "UPPER-BODY YOGA" TRAINING TO TREAT ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH HIP FRACTURE. METHODS: THIS WAS A PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, AND SINGLE-BLIND STUDY. EIGHTY-FOUR SUBJECTS AGED OVER 65 YEARS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO EITHER A CONTROL GROUP OR A YOGA GROUP TO UNDERGO AN ABDOMINAL BREATHING PROGRAM OR AN "UPPER-BODY YOGA" PROGRAM UNTIL 4 WEEKS AFTER SURGERY. THE PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE FORCED VITAL CAPACITY/PREDICTED VALUE (FVC%), PEAK COUGH FLOW (PCF), BARTHEL INDEX (BI), AND THE INCIDENCE OF PNEUMONIA. THE SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE THE RATES OF RIGHT SKILLS AND INCLINATION. RESULTS: THIRTY-NINE SUBJECTS IN THE YOGA GROUP AND 40 SUBJECTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP COMPLETED THIS STUDY. AT THE END OF THE FIRST TRAINING WEEK, FVC% (74.14% +/- 13.11% VS. 70.87% +/- 10.46%, P = 0.231) SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS, WHILE THE VALUE OF PCF (204.80 +/- 33.45 L/MIN VS. 189.06 +/- 34.80 L/MIN, P = 0.048) AND BI (38.59 +/- 8.66 VS. 33.00 +/- 9.32, P = 0.009) IN THE YOGA GROUP WAS HIGHER. AFTER 4 WEEKS OF TREATMENT, FVC%, PCF, AND BI WERE HIGHER IN THE YOGA GROUP (78.83% +/- 13.31 % VS. 72.20% +/- 10.53%, P = 0.016; 216.16 +/- 39.29 L/MIN VS. 194.95 +/- 31.14 L/MIN, P = 0.008; 70.77 +/- 10.23 VS. 65.75 +/- 11.30, P = 0.019). ONE IN THE CONTROL GROUP AND NOBODY IN THE YOGA GROUP WAS DIAGNOSED WITH PNEUMONIA. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS IN TERMS OF THE RATES OF RIGHT SKILLS, WHEREAS MORE ELDERLY PEOPLE PREFERRED THE TRAINING PROGRAM OF THE "UPPER-BODY YOGA." CONCLUSION: ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH ACUTE HIP FRACTURES ARE AT RISK OF IMPAIRED LUNG CAPACITY AND INADEQUATE COUGH. "UPPER-BODY YOGA" TRAINING MAY IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF DAILY LIFE, VITAL CAPACITY, AND COUGH FLOW IN ELDERLY PATIENTS, MAKING IT A BETTER CHOICE FOR BEDRIDDEN PATIENTS WITH HIP FRACTURE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                
13 1816 15 PROGRESSIVE OPTIC NEUROPATHY IN CONGENITAL GLAUCOMA ASSOCIATED WITH THE SIRSASANA YOGA POSTURE. THE AUTHORS DESCRIBE A CASE OF PROGRESSIVE OPTIC NEUROPATHY IN A PATIENT WITH CONGENITAL GLAUCOMA WHO HAD ROUTINELY PRACTICED THE SIRSASANA (HEADSTAND) YOGA POSTURE FOR SEVERAL YEARS. OPHTHALMIC EXAMINATION INCLUDED BEST-CORRECTED VISUAL ACUITY, ANTERIOR SEGMENT EXAMINATION, INDIRECT OPHTHALMOSCOPY, ULTRASOUND PACHYMETRY FOR CENTRAL CORNEAL THICKNESS, AND INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER MAINTAINING THE SIRSASANA POSTURE FOR 5 MINUTES. INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING THE SIRSASANA POSTURE. TRANSIENT ELEVATION IN INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE DURING YOGA EXERCISES MAY LEAD TO PROGRESSIVE GLAUCOMATOUS OPTIC NEUROPATHY, ESPECIALLY IN SUSCEPTIBLE PATIENTS WITH CONGENITAL GLAUCOMA.	2008

15 2911 16 [PSEUDOARTHROSIS OF THE FIRST RIB IN A PATIENT WHO PRACTICES YOGA. A CASE REPORT]. INTRODUCTION: PSEUDOARTHROSIS OF THE FIRST RIB IS A RARE CONDITION THAT MAY OCCUR IN ATHLETES AS A RESULT OF REPETITIVE ACTIVITIES, MAINLY OVERHEAD. THE USUAL CLINICAL PRESENTATION IS PAIN IN THE NECK OR THE IPSILATERAL SHOULDER. CASE REPORT: THIS IS THE CASE OF A 19-YEAR-OLD FEMALE PATIENT WHO HAD SUDDEN PAIN OF THE BASE OF THE NECK WHILE DOING YOGA. PSEUDOARTHROSIS OF THE FIRST RIB WAS DIAGNOSED WITH X-RAYS AND CAT SCAN. TREATMENT CONSISTED OF A REHABILITATION AND PHYSICAL THERAPY PROGRAM THAT WAS SUCCESSFUL DESPITE THE PERSISTENCE OF THE PSEUDOARTHROSIS. DISCUSSION: CASES OF FIRST RIB FRACTURES HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN ATHLETES PRACTICING MULTIPLE ACTIVITIES; HOWEVER, PSEUDOARTHROSIS CASES ARE RARE SINCE MOST OF THEM PROGRESS TO BONE HEALING. THIS IS THE FIRST REPORTED CASE OF A FRACTURE OR PSEUDOARTHROSIS IN A PATIENT PRACTICING YOGA. AS IN MOST REPORTED CASES, CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT WAS SUCCESSFUL. CONCLUSION: FRACTURES AND PSEUDOARTHROSIS OF THE FIRST RIB ARE RARE IN ATHLETES AND SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF ATHLETES PRESENTING WITH SHOULDER AND NECK PAIN. CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT IS SUCCESSFUL IN MOST CASES.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
16 2662 29 YOGA IN BURN: ROLE OF PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISE ON PULMONARY FUNCTION, RESPIRATORY MUSCLE ACTIVITY AND EXERCISE TOLERANCE IN FULL-THICKNESS CIRCUMFERENTIAL BURNS OF THE CHEST. BACKGROUND: CIRCUMFERENTIAL BURN OF CHEST (CBC) IS A SIGNIFICANT TYPE OF BURN AND CONSIDERS AS A MAJOR CAUSE OF RESTRICTIVE LUNG DISEASE (RLD). PATIENT WHO HAS CBC WITH RLD LEADS TO RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS SUCH AS BREATHING DIFFICULTY, AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION, REDUCED EXERCISE CAPACITY AND ALTERED PULMONARY FUNCTIONS. HOWEVER, STUDIES EXAMINING THE ROLE OF PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISE ON PULMONARY FUNCTION, RESPIRATORY MUSCLE ACTIVITY AND EXERCISE TOLERANCE IN FULL THICKNESS CIRCUMFERENTIAL BURN OF CHEST ARE LACKING. OBJECTIVE: TO FIND THE SHORT TERM EFFECTS OF PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISE ON PULMONARY FUNCTION, RESPIRATORY MUSCLE ACTIVITY AND EXERCISE TOLERANCE IN FULL THICKNESS CIRCUMFERENTIAL BURNS OF CHEST. METHODS: THROUGH SIMPLE RANDOM SAMPLING METHOD THIRTY SUBJECTS (N = 30) WITH RLD FOLLOWING CBC WERE ALLOCATED TO PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISE GROUP (PBE-G; N = 15) AND CONVENTIONAL BREATHING EXERCISE GROUP (CBE-G; N = 15). THEY RECEIVED PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISE AND CONVENTIONAL BREATHING EXERCISE FOR 4 WEEKS RESPECTIVELY. ALL THE SUBJECTS RECEIVED CHEST MOBILITY EXERCISE AS COMMON TREATMENT. PRIMARY (NUMERIC PAIN RATING SCALE - NPRS, FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME (FEV1), FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC) AND MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION (MVV) AND SECONDARY (ELECTROMYOGRAM OF STERNOCLEIDOMASTOID, SCALENE, EXTERNAL INTERCOSTAL AND DIAPHRAGM MUSCLE, 6 MIN WALK TEST & GLOBAL RATING OF CHANGE - GRC) OUTCOME MEASURES WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE, AFTER FOUR WEEKS AND AFTER THREE MONTHS FOLLOW UP. RESULTS: BASELINE DEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL VARIABLES SHOW HOMOGENOUS DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN THE GROUPS (P > 0.05). FOUR WEEKS FOLLOWING DIFFERENT BREATHING EXERCISES, PBE-G GROUP SHOWS MORE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PAIN INTENSITY, PULMONARY FUNCTION, RESPIRATORY MUSCLE ACTIVITY, EXERCISE TOLERANCE AND GLOBAL RATING OF CHANGE THAN CBE-G GROUP (P </= 0.05) AT FOUR WEEKS AND THREE MONTHS FOLLOW UP. CONCLUSION: BOTH GROUPS SHOWED IMPROVEMENT OVER TIME. HOWEVER, DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GROUPS WERE NOTICED SMALL. STILL PHYSIOTHERAPY MANAGEMENT, WHICH INCLUDED PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISES WITH CHEST MOBILIZATION PROGRAM, HAD AN EFFECTIVE STRATEGY IN THE TREATMENT OF RESTRICTIVE LUNG DISEASE FOLLOWING CIRCUMFERENTIAL BURN OF CHEST.	2021	

17 1813 17 PROGRESSION OF GLAUCOMA ASSOCIATED WITH THE SIRSASANA (HEADSTAND) YOGA POSTURE. THIS ARTICLE REPORTS A CASE OF PROGRESSIVE GLAUCOMATOUS OPTIC NEUROPATHY AND VISUAL FIELD LOSS THAT OCCURRED IN A PATIENT WHO PRACTICED THE SIRSASANA (HEADSTAND) YOGA POSTURE ON A DAILY BASIS FOR MANY YEARS. VISUAL FIELD ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED THROUGH STANDARD AUTOMATED PERIMETRY. INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE (IOP) WAS MEASURED THROUGH PNEUMOTONOMETRY IN THE SITTING POSITION AND IN THE HEAD-DOWN POSITION. STEREO-OPTIC DISC PHOTOGRAPHS WERE OBTAINED. IOP INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE HEAD-DOWN POSITION. OPTIC DISC EVALUATION REVEALED A NEW DISC HEMORRHAGE IN THE LEFT EYE. VISUAL FIELD ANALYSIS OVER A PERIOD OF 2 Y SHOWED PROGRESSION OF A SUPERIOR ARCUATE DEFECT IN THE LEFT EYE. TRANSIENT INCREASES IN IOP ASSOCIATED WITH THE YOGA HEADSTAND POSTURE MAY LEAD TO PROGRESSIVE GLAUCOMATOUS OPTIC NERVE DAMAGE AND VISUAL FIELD LOSS.	2006	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
18  264 17 ACUTE CHEST PAIN AND ESOPHAGEAL MUCOSAL INJURY FOLLOWING AN EXTREME YOGA POSITION CASE REPORT. A YOUNG LADY COMPLAINED OF THE SUDDEN ONSET OF INTENSE CHEST PAIN, IN CONSEQUENCE OF AN EXTREME HYPEREXTENSION OF THE BACK IN A YOGA POSITION. AT ENDOSCOPY A LARGE LESION OF THE ESOPHAGEAL EPITHELIUM WAS DETECTED, INVOLVING THE MIDDLE THIRD OF THE ANTERIOR WALL OF THE ESOPHAGUS. OTHER SYMPTOMS REPORTED BY THE PATIENT WERE DYSPHAGIA AND ODYNOPHAGIA, DEPICTING THE TYPICAL FEATURES OF INTRAMURAL HEMATOMA, ALSO KNOWN AS INTRAMURAL DISSECTION OR INTRAMURAL PERFORATION OF THE OESOPHAGUS. THE PATIENT WAS MANAGED CONSERVATIVELY AND SYMPTOMS DISAPPEARED WITHIN A WEEK. A BARIUM SWALLOW AT SIX MONTHS REPORTED NORMAL FINDINGS.

19 2232 21 THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON INSPIRATORY MUSCLE PERFORMANCE IN VETERANS WITH COPD: A PILOT STUDY. CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD) CAUSES RESPIRATORY MUSCLE WEAKNESS THAT LEADS TO DISABLING DYSPNEA AND POOR FUNCTIONAL PERFORMANCE. THERAPIES ARE OFTEN GEARED TO IMPROVE INSPIRATORY MUSCLE PERFORMANCE. YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE EXERCISE CAPACITY, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND SOME PULMONARY FUNCTION MEASURES IN COPD, BUT LITTLE RESEARCH HAS EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA TRAINING ON INSPIRATORY MUSCLE PERFORMANCE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA TRAINING ON INSPIRATORY MUSCLE PERFORMANCE IN MILITARY VETERANS USING THE TEST OF INCREMENTAL RESPIRATORY ENDURANCE (TIRE). A PROSPECTIVE PILOT STUDY EXAMINED A 6-WEEK YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM CONSISTING OF ASANA (POSES) AND PRANAYAMA (CONTROLLED BREATHING). SUBJECTS HAD BASELINE INSPIRATORY MUSCLE WEAKNESS. THE TIRE MEASURED INSPIRATORY MUSCLE PERFORMANCE VIA THE PRO2 DEVICE, PROVIDING MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE, SUSTAINED MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE, AND INSPIRATORY DURATION. SECONDARY MEASURES INCLUDED 6-MINUTE WALK DISTANCE, ST. GEORGE RESPIRATORY QUESTIONNAIRE, HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE, AND SPIROMETRY. MEAN AGE AND BMI OF SUBJECTS WERE 67 +/- 3.6 YEARS AND 20.7 +/- 3.3, RESPECTIVELY. THE MAJORITY OF SUBJECTS HAD SEVERE (28.7%) OR VERY SEVERE (57.1%) COPD. STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVE M E N T S WERE SEEN IN MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE (39.0 +/- 14.1 CMH2O TO 56.4 +/- 20.6 CMH2O) AND SUSTAINED MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE (244.1 +/- 100.6 PTU TO 308.1 +/- 121.2 PTU). NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WE RE OBSERVED IN 6-MINUTE WALK DISTANCE, ST. GEORGE RESPIRATORY QUESTIONNAIRE, HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE, OR SPIROMETRY. YOGA TRAINING HAS THE POTENTIAL IN IMPROVE INSPIRATORY MUSCLE PERFORMANCE IN VETERANS WITH SEVERE TO VERY SEVERE COPD WHO PRESENT WITH INSPIRATORY MUSCLE WEAKNESS. THIS IS OF IMPORTANCE BECAUSE IMPROVING INSPIRA-TORY MUSCLE PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE COPD OUTCOMES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
20 2363 25 VOLUNTARILY INDUCED VOMITING - A YOGA TECHNIQUE TO ENHANCE PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN HEALTHY HUMANS. VOMITING IS A COMPLEX AUTONOMIC REFLEX ORCHESTRATED BY SEVERAL NEUROLOGICAL CENTRES IN THE BRAIN. VAGUS, THE CRANIAL NERVE PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN REGULATION OF VOMITING. KUNJAL KRIYA (VOLUNTARILY INDUCED VOMITING), IS A YOGIC CLEANSING TECHNIQUE WHICH INVOLVES VOLUNTARILY INDUCING VOMITING AFTER DRINKING SALINE WATER (5%) ON EMPTY STOMACH. THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED WITH AN OBJECTIVE TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECT OF VOLUNTARY INDUCED VOMITING (VIV) ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN EXPERIENCED PRACTITIONERS AND NOVICES AND DERIVE ITS POSSIBLE THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS. EIGHTEEN HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS VOLUNTEERED FOR THE STUDY OF WHICH NINE HAD PRIOR EXPERIENCE OF VIV WHILE NINE DID NOT. PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS WERE PERFORMED BEFORE AND AFTER 10 MIN OF REST FOLLOWING VIV. ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE WAS PERFORMED ADJUSTED FOR GENDER AND BASELINE VALUES. NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE OBSERVED ACROSS GENDERS. THE RESULTS OF THE PRESENT STUDY SUGGEST A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SLOW VITAL CAPACITY [F(1,13) = 5.699; P = 0.03] AND FORCED INSPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1ST SECOND [P = 0.02] AND REDUCTION IN EXPIRATORY RESERVE VOLUME [F(1,13) = 5.029; P = 0.04] AND RESPIRATORY RATE [F(1,13) = 3.244, P = 0.09]. THESE CHANGES SUGGEST THE POSSIBLE ROLE OF VIV IN ENHANCING THE ENDURANCE OF THE RESPIRATORY MUSCLES, DECREASED AIRWAY RESISTANCE, BETTER EMPTYING OF LUNGS AND VAGAL PREDOMINANCE RESPECTIVELY. WE CONCLUDE THAT VIV WHEN PRACTICED REGULARLY ENHANCES THE ENDURANCE OF THE RESPIRATORY MUSCLES AND DECREASES AIRWAY RESISTANCE. THESE FINDINGS ALSO INDICATE NEED FOR SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF VIV IN THE MANAGEMENT OF MOTION SICKNESS AND RESTRICTIVE PULMONARY DISORDERS LIKE BRONCHITIS AND BRONCHIAL ASTHMA.	2018

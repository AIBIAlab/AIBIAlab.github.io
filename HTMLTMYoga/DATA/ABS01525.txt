1 1525 107 IYENGAR YOGA AND THE USE OF PROPS FOR PEDIATRIC CHRONIC PAIN: A CASE STUDY. IYENGAR YOGA USES POSTURES AND PROPS TO SUPPORT THE BODY SO THAT PRACTITIONERS CAN ENGAGE IN POSES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE MORE DIFFICULT. THIS TYPE OF YOGA MAY BE USEFUL IN TREATING CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WHO HAVE CHRONIC PAIN AND DISABILITY. IN THIS CASE STUDY, THE AUTHORS DISCUSS A 14-Y-OLD GIRL WHO HAD TWO SURGERIES FOR GASTRO-ESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE (GERD) AND WHO HAD CONTINUED CHEST AND ABDOMINAL PAIN, AS WELL AS VOMITING, DIFFICULTY EATING, WEIGHT LOSS, AND ANXIETY. HAVING SIGNIFICANTLY IMPAIRED FUNCTIONING, SHE WAS UNABLE TO ATTEND SCHOOL, SLEEP, SOCIALIZE, OR EAT, AND SHE HAD BECOME WHEELCHAIR-BOUND. DESPITE EVALUATIONS AND TREATMENTS BY SPECIALISTS OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, HER SYMPTOMS HAD NOT IMPROVED. THIS CASE HISTORY DESCRIBES HOW THE AUTHORS USED A 4-MO TREATMENT OF IYENGAR YOGA TO HELP THE ADOLESCENT RESUME ACTIVITIES AND RE-ENGAGE WITH HER ENVIRONMENT. THE AUTHORS INTEND THIS REPORT TO STIMULATE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF THIS FORM OF TREATMENT FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH CHRONIC PAIN.	2013

3  924  22 EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN EATING DISORDERS - A CASE REPORT. EATING DISORDERS ARE AMONG THE MOST COMMON PSYCHOSOMATIC DISEASES AND ARE OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH NEGATIVE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES. THE USE OF YOGA AS A TREATMENT METHOD IN EATING DISORDERS IS CONTROVERSIAL DISCUSSED. THE INTERVIEWEE WAS A 38 YEAR OLD FEMALE PATIENT SUFFERING ON ANOREXIA NERVOSA AND VARIOUS PSYCHOSOMATIC-PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSES IN HER MEDICAL HISTORY. THE PATIENT REPORTED THAT YOGA RECOVERED THE SOUL CONTACT WHICH SHE LOST AND SHE HAD LEARNED TO PERCEIVE AND FEEL HERSELF AGAIN. SHE STATED THAT YOGA HELPED HER TO FIND ACCESS TO HER BODY AND ITS NEEDS AND TO COPE WITH HER TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES. SHE ALSO REPORTED THAT ATTITUDES HAVE CHANGED IN RELATION TO HER STOMACH IN THE TREATMENT OF HER ANOREXIA. THE CASE REPORT CONFIRMED THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF YOGA ON EATING DISORDERS. RESEARCH SHOULD PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE INFLUENCE OF INDIVIDUAL'S CO-MORBIDITIES, AS EATING DISORDERS USUALLY OCCUR IN ASSOCIATION WITH CO-MORBIDITIES.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
4 2556  19 YOGA FOR CHILDREN. THERE IS AN INCREASING INTEREST IN THE USE OF YOGA FOR CHILDREN TO CALM THE MIND AND INCREASE HEALTH AND WELL BEING. DESPITE SCANT BUT INCREASING EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN CHILDREN, SPECIAL YOGA PROGRAMS WITHIN SCHOOLS ARE BEING DEVELOPED FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS. THIS INCREASING POPULARITY OF THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA MAY ENCOURAGE PARENTS TO CONSIDER YOGA FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND REQUEST REFERRALS OR CLARIFICATION OF THE PURPORTED EFFECTS. A DESCRIPTION OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL BASIS OF YOGA, THE BASIC COMPONENTS OF A YOGA PRACTICE, SAFETY CONCERNS, AND HOW TO LOCATE AND EVALUATE A YOGA PROGRAM FOR CHILDREN WILL BE ADDRESSED.	2009

7 2600  19 YOGA FOR OSTEOARTHRITIS: NURSING AND RESEARCH CONSIDERATIONS. OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) IS A LEADING CAUSE OF PAIN AND DISABILITY WORLDWIDE. CURRENT TREATMENT GUIDELINES RECOMMEND NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES SUCH AS YOGA FOR FIRSTLINE TREATMENT OF OA. YOGA IS A PROMISING MIND-BODY PRACTICE THAT INCLUDES PHYSICAL POSTURES, BREATHING PRACTICES, AND MEDITATIVE MENTAL FOCUS. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS THE CURRENT EVIDENCE, AS WELL AS A PROPOSED CONCEPTUAL MODEL FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. CURRENT RESEARCH ON YOGA FOR OA IS SCANT BUT PROMISING, SHOWING SOME EVIDENCE OF REDUCED PAIN, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, AND DISABILITY. THE CONCEPTUAL MODEL DESCRIBED HERE PROPOSES MUSCULOSKELETAL EFFECTS (STRENGTHENING, FLEXIBILITY, RELAXATION), REDUCTION OF AUTONOMIC AROUSAL, AND THERAPEUTIC COGNITIVE PATTERNS (DISTRACTION, MINDFULNESS) AS POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT MECHANISMS OF YOGA. THIS ARTICLE ALSO DESCRIBES CONSIDERATIONS FOR PATIENTS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WHEN EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL USEFULNESS AND SAFETY OF YOGA PROGRAMS: YOGA STYLE, INSTRUCTOR QUALIFICATIONS, AND AMOUNT OF TIME SPENT IN YOGA PRACTICE.	2012

11 1438  36 INCORPORATING YOGA THERAPY INTO PRIMARY CARE: THE CASEY HEALTH INSTITUTE. INDIVIDUALS SEEK COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE (CAM) FOR A VARIETY OF HEALTH CONDITIONS, AND YOGA IS A POPULAR CAM MODALITY. OVER THE PAST FEW DECADES, YOGA HAS BECOME INCORPORATED INTO HUNDREDS OF HEALTHCARE FACILITIES, MOST COMMONLY IN LARGE UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTERS. WHILE RESEARCH HAS SHOWN YOGA TO BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING SYMPTOMS AND IMPROVING OUTCOMES IN CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS, MOST PATIENTS SEEK YOGA THERAPY ON THEIR OWN, AS FEW PRIMARY CARE PRACTITIONERS HAVE INCORPORATED YOGA THERAPY INTO THEIR PRACTICES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO DESCRIBE THE EFFORTS OF THE CASEY HEALTH INSTITUTE TO INCORPORATE YOGA THERAPY INTO THEIR PRIMARY CARE INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE CENTER. AT CASEY HEALTH, A FULL-TIME CLINICAL YOGA SPECIALIST WORKS ALONGSIDE THE PHYSICIANS, NURSES, AND CAM PROVIDERS IN DELIVERING CARE TO A WIDE VARIETY OF PATIENTS. THE MAJORITY OF REFERRALS TO YOGA THERAPY HAVE BEEN FOR PAIN-RELATED MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS, AS WELL AS HYPERTENSION, HEADACHES, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND SLEEP DISTURBANCES. MOST PATIENTS ATTEND WEEKLY 60-MINUTE INDIVIDUAL SESSIONS, AND THE CLINICAL YOGA SPECIALIST STAYS IN TOUCH WITH THE PATIENT BETWEEN APPOINTMENTS VIA TELEPHONE AND EMAIL. T H E CLINICAL YOGA SPECIALIST HAS BECOME AN INTEGRAL PART OF CASEY HEALTH, PARTICIPATING IN COLLABORATIVE MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS IN WHICH TWO CAM PRACTITIONERS PROVIDE SIMULTANEOUS TREATMENTS TO A PATIENT. SHE ALSO PARTICIPATES IN THE CLINIC'S ONGOING WEIGHT LOSS PROGRAM. THE CLINICAL YOGA SPECIALIST SPENDS ONE MORNING EACH WEEK "FLOATING" IN THE CLINIC, WHEN SHE IS ON-CALL TO THE PRACTITIONERS TO ASSIST IN TREATMENT AND/OR TO INTRODUCE A YOGA THERAPY EXPERIENCE TO THE PATIENTS. THESE BRIEF INTERVENTIONS INTRODUCE THE PATIENTS TO THE THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS OF YOGA, WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY DEMONSTRATING YOGA'S EFFECTIVENESS TO THE HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. CASEY HEALTH HAS DEVELOPED A UNIQUE TEACHER TRAINING PROGRAM WHOSE FACULTY INCLUDES SENIOR IYENGAR YOGA TEACHERS AS WELL AS PHYSICIANS AND CAM PRACTITIONERS. CASEY HEALTH IS INCORPORATING CLINICAL OUTCOMES INTO THEIR ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD THAT CAN BE USED INTERNALLY TO ASSESS COMPARABLE EFFECTIVENESS AND COST EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DIFFERENT TREATMENT MODALITIES SUCH AS YOGA THERAPY, PROVIDING EVIDENCE THAT EVENTUALLY MAY LEAD TO YOGA THERAPY BECOMING AN ACCEPTED TREATMENT THAT IS ELIGIBLE FOR INSURANCE REIMBURSEMENT.	2015	

12 2611  25 YOGA FOR REHABILITATION: AN OVERVIEW. THE USE OF YOGA FOR REHABILITATION HAS DIVERSE APPLICATIONS. YOGA PRACTICE BENEFITED MENTALLY HANDICAPPED SUBJECTS BY IMPROVING THEIR MENTAL ABILITY, ALSO THE MOTOR CO-ORDINATION AND SOCIAL SKILLS. PHYSICALLY HANDICAPPED SUBJECTS HAD A RESTORATION OF SOME DEGREE OF FUNCTIONAL ABILITY AFTER PRACTICING YOGA. VISUALLY IMPAIRED CHILDREN CHILDREN SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THEIR ABNORMAL ANXIETY LEVELS WHEN THEY PRACTICED YOGA FOR THREE WEEKS, WHILE A PROGRAM OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY HAD NO SUCH EFFECT. SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED ADULTS (PRISONERS IN A JAIL) AND CHILDREN IN A REMAND HOME SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SLEEP, APPETITE AND GENERAL WELL BEING, AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN PHYSIOLOGICAL AROUSAL. THE PRACTICE OF MEDITATION WAS REPORTED TO DECREASE THE DEGREE OF SUBSTANCE (MARIJUANA) ABUSE, BY STRENGTHENING THE MENTAL RESOLVE AND DECREASING THE ANXIETY. ANOTHER IMPORTANT AREA IS THE APPLICATION OF YOGA (AND INDEED, LIFESTYLE CHANGE), IN THE REHABILITATION OF PATIENTS WITH CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE. FINALLY, THE POSSIBLE ROLE OF YOGA IN IMPROVING THE MENTAL STATE AND GENERAL WELL BEING OF HIV POSITIVE PERSONS AND PATIENTS WITH AIDS, IS BEING EXPLORED.	1997

A LARGE NUMBER OF STUDIES HAVE CONSISTENTLY DEMONSTRATED THE POTENTIAL OF YOGA, NOT ONLY IN THE TREATMENT OF PSYCHIATRIC AND PSYCHOSOMATIC DISORDER BUT ALSO IN PROMOTING POSITIVE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. THIS PAPER REVIEWS VARIOUS STUDIES ON THE TREATMENT OF NEUROSIS WITH TECHNIQUES DERIVED FROM YOGA. A FEW LACUNAE HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND POSSIBLE DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH ARE OUTLINED. IT IS HOPED THAT RESEARCH ALONG THESE LINES WILL DEVELOP A STANDARDIZED METHOD OF YOGA THERAPY WHICH CAN BE UTILIZED AND INTEGRATED WITHIN THE EXISTING METHODS OF TREATMENT OF NEUROTIC DISORDERS.	1994	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
15 2908  12 [PHYSICAL EXERCISE AND YOGA IN PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF ADDICTIVE DISEASES]. PREVENTION OF ADDICTIVE DISEASES SHOULD BE COMPLEX AND SYSTEMATIC AND IT SHOULD INCLUDE TRAINING OF SOCIAL SKILLS, DECISION-MAKING SKILLS, FAMILY INTERVENTION, ETC. SIMILARLY, EFFECTIVE TREATMENT IS USUALLY LONG-TERM, SYSTEMATIC AND COMPLEX. PHYSICAL EXERCISE AND YOGA CAN BE USEFUL COMPONENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT PROGRAMMES. ON THE OTHER HAND, COMPETITIVE PROFESSIONAL SPORT RATHER INCREASES THE NUMBER OF RISK FACTORS FOR SUBSTANCE-RELATED PROBLEMS. PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE USE OF YOGA IN SUBSTANCE DEPENDENT PATIENTS AND PATHOLOGICAL GAMBLES ARE MENTIONED. ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES OF YOGA IS THE INTEGRATION OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE AND RELAXATION.	2005

17 1588  27 MEDICAL YOGA: ANOTHER WAY OF BEING IN THE WORLD-A PHENOMENOLOGICAL STUDY FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF PERSONS SUFFERING FROM STRESS-RELATED SYMPTOMS. THE PREVALENCE OF STRESS-RELATED ILLNESS HAS GROWN IN RECENT YEARS. MANY OF THESE PATIENTS SEEK HELP IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE. YOGA CAN REDUCE STRESS AND THUS COMPLEMENTS PHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPY IN MEDICAL PRACTICE. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, NO STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED PATIENTS' EXPERIENCES OF YOGA TREATMENT IN A PRIMARY HEALTH CARE SETTING OR, SPECIFICALLY, THE EXPERIENCES OF YOGA WHEN SUFFERING FROM STRESS-RELATED ILLNESS. THUS, THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE THE MEANING OF PARTICIPATING IN MEDICAL YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR STRESS-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSIS IN A PRIMARY HEALTH CARE SETTING. THIS STUDY HAS A DESCRIPTIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL DESIGN AND TOOK PLACE AT A PRIMARY HEALTH CARE CENTRE IN SWEDEN DURING 2011. FIVE WOMEN AND ONE MAN (43-51 YEARS) PARTICIPATED. THEY WERE RECRUITED FROM THE INTERVENTION GROUP (N=18) IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL, IN WHICH THEY HAD PARTICIPATED IN A MEDICAL YOGA GROUP IN ADDITION TO STANDARD CARE FOR 12 WEEKS. DATA WERE COLLECTED BY MEANS OF QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS, AND A PHENOMENOLOGICAL DATA ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED. THE ESSENTIAL MEANING OF THE MEDICAL YOGA EXPERIENCE WAS THAT THE MEDICAL YOGA WAS NOT AN ENDPOINT OF RECOVERY BUT THE START OF A PROCESS TOWARDS AN INCREASED SENSE OF WHOLENESS. IT WAS DESCRIBED AS A WAY OF ALLEVIATING SUFFERING, AND IT PROVIDED THE PARTICIPANTS WITH A TOOL FOR DEALING WITH THEIR STRESS AND CURRENT SITUATION ON A PRACTICAL LEVEL. IT LED TO GREATER SELF-AWARENESS AND SELF-ESTEEM, WHICH IN TURN HAD AN IMPLICIT IMPACT ON THEIR LIFEWORLD. IN PHENOMENOLOGICAL TERMS, THIS CAN BE SUMMARIZED AS ANOTHER WAY OF BEING IN THE WORLD, ENCOMPASSING A PERCEPTION OF DEEPENED IDENTITY. FROM A PHILOSOPHICAL PERSPECTIVE, DUE TO USING THE BODY IN A NEW WAY (YOGA), THE PARTICIPANTS HAD LEARNT TO SEE THINGS DIFFERENTLY, WHICH ENRICHED AND RECAST THEIR PERCEPTION OF THEMSELVES AND THEIR LIVES.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
18 2015  22 SUGGESTIONS FOR ADAPTING YOGA TO THE NEEDS OF OLDER ADULTS WITH OSTEOPOROSIS. BACKGROUND: EXERCISE SUCH AS YOGA MAY HAVE HEALTH BENEFITS FOR OLDER ADULTS WITH OSTEOPOROSIS, BUT WITHOUT ATTENTION TO SAFE MOVEMENT YOGA CAN ALSO INCREASE THE RISK FOR INJURY. OBJECTIVE: THE CURRENT ARTICLE PROVIDES SUGGESTIONS FOR HOW TO ADAPT YOGA TO THE NEEDS OF OLDER ADULTS WITH OSTEOPOROSIS. SUGGESTIONS: A GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR EXERCISE IS THAT OLDER ADULTS WITH OSTEOPOROSIS SHOULD PARTICIPATE IN A MULTICOMPONENT EXERCISE PROGRAM, INCLUDING RESISTANCE AND BALANCE TRAINING. CONTRAINDICATED MOVEMENTS INCLUDE END-RANGE FLEXION/EXTENSION/ROTATION OF THE SPINE AND INTERNAL/EXTERNAL ROTATION OF THE HIP. YOGA POSTURES THAT SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED INCLUDE POSTURES EMPHASIZING SPINAL ALIGNMENT AND EXTENSION TO MID-RANGE IN STANDING AND ON THE FLOOR. OVERARCHING CONSIDERATIONS FOR PARTICIPATION IN YOGA ARE THAT CLASSES SHOULD BE DESIGNED FOR HIGHER-RISK OLDER ADULTS, LED BY AN INSTRUCTOR WHO HAS HAD PROPER TRAINING WITH INDIVIDUALS WITH OSTEOPOROSIS, SHOULD BE A NONCOMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, AND SHOULD GIVE ATTENTION TO WHICH POSTURES ARE SAFE AND HOW TO TRANSITION SAFELY.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
19 2501  26 YOGA AS THERAPY FOR NEURODEGENERATIVE DISORDERS: A CASE REPORT OF THERAPEUTIC YOGA FOR ADRENOMYELONEUROPATHY. YOGA IS A PROMISING THERAPEUTIC MODALITY FOR NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES. THIS CASE STUDY PRESENTS A THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROTOCOL FOR ADRENOMYELONEUROPATHY (AMN) AND ITS EFFECT ON A PATIENT'S QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), AGILITY, BALANCE, AND PERIPHERAL DEXTERITY. A 61-Y-OLD MAN DIAGNOSED WITH AMN WHO WAS EXPERIENCING (1) PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY IN HIS LEGS AND FEET, (2) LOWER-BACK PAIN (LBP), AND (3) OSTEOARTHRITIS RECEIVED 60-MIN WEEKLY THERAPEUTIC YOGA SESSIONS FOR A 10-MO PERIOD. YOGA THERAPY INCLUDED HATHA YOGA ASANAS (POSES) AND PRANAYAMA (BREATHING EXERCISES). HATHA YOGA ASANAS WERE ALIGNED WITH 7 BERG BALANCE SCALE (BBS) INDICATORS TO MEASURE IMPROVEMENT IN BALANCE AND RANGE OF MOTION. THE 10-MO COURSE OF THERAPEUTIC YOGA RESULTED IN IMPROVED LBP; IMPROVED FLEXION OF THE PATIENT'S HIPS, KNEES, AND ANKLES; IMPROVED PROPULSION PHASE OF WALKING; AND IMPROVEMENT IN THE PATIENT'S ABILITY TO STAND AND BALANCE WITHOUT AN ASSISTIVE DEVICE. THE EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY ON THE PATIENT IN THIS CASE STUDY ALIGNS WITH CURRENT QOL IMPROVEMENTS NOTED IN CURRENT RESEARCH ON YOGA THERAPY FOR NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS. THE DESCRIBED CONCEPTS AND METHODS OF EMPLOYING THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROVIDE INSIGHTS FOR CLINICIANS INTO A MODALITY THAT IS LOW RISK AND LOW COST AND THAT CAN SUPPORT INDIVIDUALS WITH OTHER NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS, SUCH AS MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS), FIBROMYALGIA (FM), AND DISEASES OF THE PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. FURTHER STUDY IS WARRANTED TO HELP DETERMINE THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF YOGA THERAPY FOR THESE CONDITIONS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
20 2924  21 [YOGA AND MEDITATION: HELPFUL TECHNIQUES TO IMPROVE THE LIFE OF CANCER PATIENTS]. CANCER IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE MOST UPSETTING THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN IN A LIFE TIME, IT MANAGES TO TOTALLY DESTROY THE BALANCE OF THOSE AFFECTED. THE PERSON CAN SUFFER FROM ANXIETY AND FEAR TO SUCH A POINT THAT THEY SEE THEIR FUTURE WITH TERROR. THESE DIFFICULTIES HAVE A DEVASTATING EFFECT ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF THE PATIENT AND THEIR FAMILIES, THE LATTER OFTEN BEING GIVEN LITTLE CONSIDERATION BY CARERS. SOMETIME TAILORED PSYCHOTHERAPY OR MEDICAL CARE CAN PARTIALLY CONTRIBUTE ONLY TO HELP THE PATIENT AND THEIR FAMILIES-CAREGIVER. TECHNIQUES SUCH AS YOGA AND SOME STRUCTURED MEDITATION, E.G. MINDFULNESS WHICH WORK ON THE "FEELING" OF MIND AND BODY CAN BE OF HELP. THESE TECHNIQUES LEAD TO A REDUCTION IN DISTRESS AND SO ADD TO A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE, FUNDAMENTAL IN EACH STAGE OF THE ILLNESS.	2012

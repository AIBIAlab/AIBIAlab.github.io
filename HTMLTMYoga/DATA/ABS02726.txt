1 2726 113 YOGA NIDRA PRACTICE SHOWS IMPROVEMENT IN SLEEP IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC INSOMNIA: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND YOGA NIDRA IS PRACTISED BY SAGES FOR SLEEP. THE PRACTICE IS SIMPLE TO USE AND HAS BEEN CLEARLY LAID OUT, BUT ITS ROLE IN THE TREATMENT OF CHRONIC INSOMNIA HAS NOT BEEN WELL STUDIED. METHODS IN THIS RANDOMIZED PARALLEL-DESIGN STUDY CONDUCTED DURING 2012-16, WE ENROLLED 41 PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC INSOMNIA TO RECEIVE CONVENTIONAL INTERVENTION OF COGNITIVE BEHAVIOURAL THERAPY FOR INSOMNIA (N=20) OR YOGA NIDRA (N=21). OUTCOME MEASURES WERE BOTH SUBJECTIVE USING A SLEEP DIARY AND OBJECTIVE USING POLYSOMNOGRAPHY (PSG). SALIVARY CORTISOL LEVELS WERE ALSO MEASURED. PSG WAS DONE BEFORE THE INTERVENTION IN ALL PATIENTS AND REPEATED ONLY IN THOSE WHO VOLUNTEERED FOR THE SAME. RESULTS BOTH INTERVENTIONS SHOWED AN IMPROVEMENT IN SUBJECTIVE TOTAL SLEEP TIME (TST), SLEEP EFFICIENCY, WAKE AFTER SLEEP ONSET, REDUCTION IN TOTAL WAKE DURATION AND ENHANCEMENT IN SUBJECTIVE SLEEP QUALITY. OBJECTIVELY, BOTH THE INTERVENTIONS IMPROVED TST AND TOTAL WAKE DURATION AND INCREASED N1% OF TST. YOGA NIDRA SHOWED MARKED IMPROVEMENT IN N2% AND N3% IN TST. SALIVARY CORTISOL REDUCED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER YOGA NIDRA (P=0.041). CONCLUSION IMPROVEMENT OF N3 SLEEP, TOTAL WAKE DURATION AND SUBJECTIVE SLEEP QUALITY OCCURRED FOLLOWING YOGA NIDRA PRACTICE. YOGA NIDRA PRACTICE CAN BE USED FOR TREATMENT OF CHRONIC INSOMNIA AFTER SUPERVISED PRACTICE SESSIONS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
2 2321  46 TREATMENT OF CHRONIC INSOMNIA WITH YOGA: A PRELIMINARY STUDY WITH SLEEP-WAKE DIARIES. THERE IS GOOD EVIDENCE FOR COGNITIVE AND PHYSIOLOGICAL AROUSAL IN CHRONIC INSOMNIA. ACCORDINGLY, CLINICAL TRIAL STUDIES OF INSOMNIA TREATMENTS AIMED AT REDUCING AROUSAL, INCLUDING RELAXATION AND MEDITATION, HAVE REPORTED POSITIVE RESULTS. YOGA IS A MULTICOMPONENT PRACTICE THAT IS ALSO KNOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING AROUSAL, ALTHOUGH IT HAS NOT BEEN WELL EVALUATED AS A TREATMENT FOR INSOMNIA. IN THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY, A SIMPLE DAILY YOGA TREATMENT WAS EVALUATED IN A CHRONIC INSOMNIA POPULATION CONSISTING OF SLEEP-ONSET AND/OR SLEEP-MAINTENANCE INSOMNIA AND PRIMARY OR SECONDARY INSOMNIA. PARTICIPANTS MAINTAINED SLEEP-WAKE DIARIES DURING A PRETREATMENT 2-WEEK BASELINE AND A SUBSEQUENT 8-WEEK INTERVENTION, IN WHICH THEY PRACTICED THE TREATMENT ON THEIR OWN FOLLOWING A SINGLE IN-PERSON TRAINING SESSION WITH SUBSEQUENT BRIEF IN-PERSON AND TELEPHONE FOLLOW-UPS. SLEEP EFFICIENCY (SE), TOTAL SLEEP TIME (TST), TOTAL WAKE TIME (TWT), SLEEP ONSET LATENCY (SOL), WAKE TIME AFTER SLEEP ONSET (WASO), NUMBER OF AWAKENINGS, AND SLEEP QUALITY MEASURES WERE DERIVED FROM SLEEP-WAKE DIARY ENTRIES AND WERE AVERAGED IN 2-WEEK INTERVALS. FOR 20 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETING THE PROTOCOL, STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE OBSERVED IN SE, TST, TWT, SOL, AND WASO AT END-TREATMENT AS COMPARED WITH PRETREATMENT VALUES.	2004	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
3 2521  42 YOGA DECREASES INSOMNIA IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN: A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: THE PRACTICE OF YOGA HAS BEEN PROVEN TO HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS ON REDUCING INSOMNIA. STUDIES HAVE ALSO SHOWN ITS EFFECTS ON REDUCING CLIMACTERIC SYMPTOMS. TO DATE, HOWEVER, NO STUDIES THAT EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF INSOMNIA IN A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICE ON THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH AND CLIMACTERIC SYMPTOMS OF POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF INSOMNIA. METHODS: POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN NOT UNDERGOING HORMONE THERAPY, WHO WERE 50 TO 65 YEARS OLD, WHO HAD AN APNEA-HYPOPNEA INDEX LESS THAN 15, AND WHO HAD A DIAGNOSIS OF INSOMNIA WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THREE GROUPS, AS FOLLOWS: CONTROL, PASSIVE STRETCHING, AND YOGA. QUESTIONNAIRES WERE ADMINISTERED BEFORE AND 4 MONTHS AFTER THE INTERVENTION TO EVALUATE QUALITY OF LIFE, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS, CLIMACTERIC SYMPTOMS, INSOMNIA SEVERITY, DAYTIME SLEEPINESS, AND STRESS. THE VOLUNTEERS ALSO UNDERWENT POLYSOMNOGRAPHY. THE STUDY LASTED 4 MONTHS. RESULTS: THERE WERE 44 VOLUNTEERS AT THE END OF THE STUDY. WHEN COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP, THE YOGA GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER POSTTREATMENT SCORES FOR CLIMACTERIC SYMPTOMS AND INSOMNIA SEVERITY AND HIGHER SCORES FOR QUALITY OF LIFE AND RESISTANCE PHASE OF STRESS. THE REDUCTION IN INSOMNIA SEVERITY IN THE YOGA GROUP WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THAT IN THE CONTROL AND PASSIVE-STRETCHING GROUPS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT A SPECIFIC SEQUENCE OF YOGA MIGHT BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING INSOMNIA AND MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS AS WELL AS IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WITH INSOMNIA.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
4 2031  47 TAILORED INDIVIDUAL YOGA PRACTICE IMPROVES SLEEP QUALITY, FATIGUE, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION IN CHRONIC INSOMNIA DISORDER. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC INSOMNIA DISORDER (CI) IS A PREVALENT SLEEP DISORDER THAT CAN LEAD TO DISTURBED DAYTIME FUNCTIONING AND IS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. FIRST-CHOICE TREATMENT IS COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT-I). OTHER MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS TAI-CHI AND YOGA, HAVE DEMONSTRATED SUBJECTIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN SLEEP QUALITY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR IMPROVEMENT OF SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE SLEEP QUALITY AS WELL AS MEASURES OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, SLEEPINESS, AND FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH CI. METHODS: ADULTS WITH CI WERE PROSPECTIVELY INCLUDED IN THIS SINGLE GROUP PRE-POST STUDY. BASELINE ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED HOME POLYSOMNOGRAPHY (PSG), 7-DAY ACTIGRAPHY, AND QUESTIONNAIRES (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX QUESTIONNAIRE (PSQI), HOSPITAL ANXIETY DEPRESSION SCALE (HADS), EPWORTH SLEEPINESS SCALE (ESS), PICHOT FATIGUE SCALE (PS)). PATIENTS PRACTICED VINIYOGA, AN INDIVIDUALISED YOGA PRACTICE WITH DAILY SELF-ADMINISTERED EXERCISES, FOR 14 WEEKS. ASSESSMENTS WERE REPEATED AT THE END OF YOGA PRACTICE. RESULTS: TWENTY-ONE PATIENTS COMPLETED THE STUDY. OBJECTIVE SLEEP MEASUREMENTS REVEALED NO CHANGE IN PSG PARAMETERS AFTER YOGA PRACTICE, BUT A DECREASE IN AROUSALS ON ACTIGRAPHY (P < 0.001). SUBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS IMPROVED FOR ALL QUESTIONNAIRES (PSQI, P < 0.001; HAD-A, P = 0.020, HAD-D, P = 0.001, ESS, P = 0.041, PS, P = 0.010). IN UNIVARIATE CORRELATIONS, DECREASE IN PSQI WAS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASE IN SLEEP STAGE N3 (P < 0.001) ON PSG. CONCLUSIONS: WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED A POSITIVE IMPACT OF INDIVIDUALIZED YOGA PRACTICE ON SUBJECTIVE PARAMETERS RELATED TO SLEEP AND DAYTIME SYMPTOMS IN CI, RESULTING IN FEWER AROUSALS ON ACTIGRAPHY. YOGA COULD BE PROPOSED AS A POTENTIALLY USEFUL ALTERNATIVE TO CBT-I IN CI, AS IT IS EASY TO PRACTICE AUTONOMOUSLY OVER THE LONG-TERM. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE DESIGN OF THE PRESENT STUDY, FUTURE PROSPECTIVE CONTROLLED STUDIES SHOULD FIRST CONFIRM OUR RESULTS.

5 2119  32 THE EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY ON SELECTED PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIABLES AMONG MALE PATIENTS WITH INSOMNIA. BACKGROUND: AN ESTIMATED 30-50% OF THE GENERAL POPULATION IS AFFECTED BY INSOMNIA AND 10% HAVE CHRONIC INSOMNIA. YOGA THERAPY IS BENEFICIAL IN SUCH DISORDERS AND IT HAS FEWER SIDE EFFECTS. AIM: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO FIND OUT THE EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY ON SELECTED PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIABLES AMONG MEN WITH INSOMNIA. METHODS: FORTY MALES WITH INSOMNIA WERE DIVIDED RANDOMLY INTO 2 GROUPS (THE EXPERIMENTAL AND THE CONTROL GROUPS). THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP RECEIVED EIGHT WEEKS OF YOGA THERAPY, WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT RECEIVE ANY THERAPY. THE PRE AND POST TREATMENT STRESS AND THE SELF CONFIDENCE SCORES WERE TAKEN. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE STRESS SCORES AND THE SELF CONFIDENCE SCORES IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP. THERE WERE NEITHER ANY SIDE EFFECTS NOR ANY DROP OUTS. CONCLUSION: WE CONCLUDE THAT YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT OPTION FOR THE PATIENTS WITH INSOMNIA. THERE ARE NO MAJOR SIDE EFFECTS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
6 1041  39 EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON SLEEP AND QUALITY-OF-LIFE IN ELDERLY: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. CONTEXT: YOGA AS A LIFE-STYLE PRACTICE HAS DEMONSTRATED BENEFICIAL EFFECTS. THE ROLE OF YOGA IN THE ELDERLY FOR SUCH BENEFITS MERITS INVESTIGATION. AIMS: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON QUALITY-OF-LIFE (QOL) AND SLEEP QUALITY IN THE ELDERLY LIVING IN OLD AGE HOMES. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: SINGLE BLIND CONTROLLED STUDY WITH BLOCK RANDOMIZATION OF ELDERLY HOMES. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 120 SUBJECTS FROM NINE ELDERLY HOMES WERE RANDOMIZED IN TO YOGA GROUP (N=62) AND WAITLIST GROUP (N=58). SUBJECTS IN THE YOGA GROUP WERE GIVEN YOGA INTERVENTION DAILY FOR 1 MONTH AND WEEKLY UNTIL 3 MONTHS AND WERE ENCOURAGED TO PRACTICE YOGA WITHOUT SUPERVISION UNTIL FOR 6 MONTHS. SUBJECTS IN WAITLIST GROUP RECEIVED NO INTERVENTION DURING THIS PERIOD. SUBJECTS WERE EVALUATED WITH WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION QUALITY OF LIFE (WHOQOL)-BREF FOR MEASURING QOL AND PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX FOR SLEEP QUALITY IN THE BASELINE AND AFTER 6 MONTHS. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: INDEPENDENT T-TEST AND REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE RESPECTIVELY WAS USED TO MEASURE THE DIFFERENCE IN OUTCOME MEASURES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS AT BASELINE AND AFTER THE STUDY PERIOD. RESULTS: SUBJECTS IN THE YOGA GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER NUMBER OF YEARS OF FORMAL EDUCATION. SUBJECTS IN THE YOGA GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ALL THE DOMAINS OF QOL AND TOTAL SLEEP QUALITY AFTER CONTROLLING FOR THE EFFECT OF BASELINE DIFFERENCE IN EDUCATION BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS. CONCLUSION: YOGA INTERVENTION APPEARS TO IMPROVE THE QOL AND SLEEP QUALITY OF ELDERLY LIVING IN OLD AGE HOMES. THERE IS A NEED FOR FURTHER STUDIES OVERCOMING THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS STUDY TO CONFIRM THE BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR ELDERLY IN QOL AND SLEEP QUALITY.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
7 1380  31 IMPACT OF LONG TERM YOGA PRACTICE ON SLEEP QUALITY AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE ELDERLY. BACKGROUND: SLEEP DISTURBANCES AND DECLINE IN THE PHYSICAL FUNCTIONALITY ARE COMMON CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH AGING. PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF SLEEP DISTURBANCES CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS ADVERSE EFFECTS. SHORT TERM TRIALS OF YOGA ON SLEEP HAVE SHOWN BENEFICIAL EFFECTS. OBJECTIVES: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF LONG-TERM YOGA EXERCISES ON SLEEP QUALITY AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) IN THE ELDERLY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS WAS A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY IN WHICH DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM ELDERLY PEOPLE AGED 60 YEARS OR MORE LIVING IN NAGPUR CITY. WE EMPLOYED TWO TYPES OF SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRES: PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI) AND QOL LEIDEN-PADUA (LEIPAD) QUESTIONNAIRE. A TOTAL OF 65 ELDERLY MEN AND WOMEN WHO SIGNED AN INFORMED CONSENT AND COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. SLEEP QUALITY SCORE PSQI AND QOL (LEIPAD QUESTIONNAIRE) SCORE OF THE STUDY GROUP WERE EVALUATED AND COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP USING MANN-WHITNEY U TEST. RESULTS: TOTAL PSQI SCORE IN YOGA GROUP WAS LOWER THAN THAT OF THE CONTROL GROUP. ALSO VARIOUS QOL SCORES OF THE YOGA GROUPS WERE HIGHER THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: ADDITION OF REGULAR YOGA EXERCISES IN THE DAILY ROUTINE OF ELDERLY PEOPLE CAN HELP TO ACHIEVE GOOD SLEEP QUALITY AS WELL AS IMPROVE THE QOL.	2013

METHODS: A TOTAL NUMBER OF 100 WOMEN RECRUITED FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY AND WERE THEN RANDOMLY ALLOCATED INTO TWO GROUPS: A) INTERVENTION RECEIVED YOGIC INTERVENTION AND MEDICATION FOR 6 MONTH, AND B) CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED NO YOGIC INTERVENTION AND THEY ONLY RECEIVED PRESCRIBED MEDICATION). PSYCHOLOGICAL GENERAL WELL-BEING INDEX (PGWBI) AND HORMONAL PROFILE WERE ASSESSED AT THE TIME OF BEFORE AND AFTER SIX MONTHS ON BOTH GROUPS. RESULTS: THE MEAN SCORE OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, POSITIVE WELL-BEING, GENERAL HEALTH, AND VITALITY SCORES, AS WELL AS HORMONAL LEVELS, IN POSTTEST WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT IN INTERVENTION GROUP AS COMPARED WITH PRETEST. BUT THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: YOGA NIDRA CAN BE A SUCCESSFUL THERAPY TO OVERCOME THE PSYCHIATRIC MORBIDITY ASSOCIATED WITH MENSTRUAL IRREGULARITIES. THEREFORE, YOGIC RELAXATION TRAINING (YOGA NIDRA) COULD BE PRESCRIBED AS AN ADJUNCT TO CONVENTIONAL DRUG THERAPY FOR MENSTRUAL DYSFUNCTION.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
9  764  37 EFFECT OF THE INFORMATION SUPPORT METHOD COMBINED WITH YOGA EXERCISE ON THE DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND SLEEP QUALITY OF MENOPAUSAL WOMEN. BACKGROUND: MENOPAUSE IS A SPECIAL STAGE IN A WOMAN'S LIFE, BUT NO SAFE CLINICAL TREATMENT EXISTS AGAINST MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS. TO ANALYZE THE EFFECT OF THE INFORMATION SUPPORT METHOD COMBINED WITH YOGA EXERCISE ON THE DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND SLEEP QUALITY OF MENOPAUSAL WOMEN. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: FROM JUNE 2019 TO DECEMBER 2019, MENOPAUSAL WOMEN WHO WERE NEWLY RECRUITED IN THREE YOGA CLUBS IN THREE CITIES IN EAST CHINA WERE SELECTED AS THE PARTICIPANTS BY CONVENIENCE SAMPLING. A TOTAL OF 52 WOMEN WERE IN THE EXPERIMENT GROUP AND 54 WERE IN THE CONTROL GROUP. IN 24 WEEKS, THE EXPERIMENT GROUP ENGAGED IN YOGA EXERCISE FOR 60 MINUTES EACH TIME, THREE TIMES A WEEK. THEY GROUP WAS GIVEN PROFESSIONAL POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL INFORMATION SUPPORT AT THE SAME TIME. THE KUPPERMAN MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOM DISTRESS SCALE, SELF-RATING DEPRESSION SCALE (SDS), SELF-RATING ANXIETY SCALE (SAS), AND PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI) WERE USED BEFORE THE EXPERIMENT, THREE MONTHS INTO THE EXPERIMENT, AND SIX MONTHS INTO THE EXPERIMENT TO MONITOR THE INTERVENTION EFFECT ON THE PARTICIPANTS. RESULTS: AFTER THE INTERVENTION, THE SYMPTOMS OF DISTRESS AMONG MENOPAUSAL WOMEN IN THE EXPERIMENT GROUP AND THE KUPPERMAN SCORE OF THE EXPERIMENT GROUP REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY. REPEATED MEASURES OF ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE WERE CONDUCTED IN THE TWO GROUPS (P<0.001). AFTER THE INTERVENTION, THE DEPRESSION SCORE OF THE EXPERIMENT GROUP DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS IN REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE IN THE SDS SCORE (P<0.001). AFTER THE INTERVENTION, THE ANXIETY SCORE OF THE EXPERIMENT GROUP REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY, AND REPEATED MEASURES OF ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE IN THE SAS SCORE WERE CONDUCTED IN THE TWO GROUPS (P<0.001). AFTER THE INTERVENTION, THE SLEEP QUALITY OF THE EXPERIMENT GROUP IMPROVED, AND REPEATED MEASURES OF ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE IN SLEEP QUALITY WERE CONDUCTED IN THE TWO GROUPS (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: THE INFORMATION SUPPORT METHOD COMBINED WITH YOGA EXERCISE CAN ALLEVIATE THE DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY OF MENOPAUSAL WOMEN, IMPROVE THEIR SLEEP QUALITY, AND REDUCE THEIR SYMPTOMS OF MENOPAUSAL DISTRESS.	2020	

10 1457  32 INFLUENCE OF YOGA AND AYURVEDA ON SELF-RATED SLEEP IN A GERIATRIC POPULATION. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: SLEEP IN OLDER PERSONS IS CHARACTERIZED BY DECREASED ABILITY TO STAY ASLEEP, RESULTING IN FRAGMENTED SLEEP AND REDUCED DAYTIME ALERTNESS. PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF INSOMNIA IN OLDER PERSONS IS ASSOCIATED WITH HAZARDOUS SIDE EFFECTS. HENCE, THE PRESENT STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND AYURVEDA ON THE SELF RATED SLEEP IN A GERIATRIC POPULATION. METHODS: OF THE 120 RESIDENTS FROM A HOME FOR THE AGED, 69 WERE STRATIFIED BASED ON AGE (FIVE YEAR INTERVALS) AND RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO THREE GROUPS I.E., YOGA (PHYSICAL POSTURES, RELAXATION TECHNIQUES, VOLUNTARILY REGULATED BREATHING AND LECTURES ON YOGA PHILOSOPHY), AYURVEDA (A HERBAL PREPARATION), AND WAIT-LIST CONTROL (NO INTERVENTION). THE GROUPS WERE EVALUATED FOR SELF-ASSESSMENT OF SLEEP OVER A ONE WEEK PERIOD AT BASELINE, AND AFTER THREE AND SIX MONTHS OF THE RESPECTIVE INTERVENTIONS. RESULTS: THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE TIME TAKEN TO FALL ASLEEP (APPROXIMATE GROUP AVERAGE DECREASE: 10 MIN, P<0.05), AN INCREASE IN THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS SLEPT (APPROXIMATE GROUP AVERAGE INCREASE: 60 MIN, P< 0.05) AND IN THE FEELING OF BEING RESTED IN THE MORNING BASED ON A RATING SCALE (P<0.05) AFTER SIX MONTHS. THE OTHER GROUPS SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSION: YOGA PRACTICE IMPROVED DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF SLEEP IN A GERIATRIC POPULATION.	2005	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
11 1585  33 MEDICAL YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH STRESS-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSES IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. AN INCREASING NUMBER OF PATIENTS ARE SUFFERING FROM STRESS-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE MEDICAL YOGA TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH STRESS-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND DIAGNOSES IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE. A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY WAS PERFORMED AT A PRIMARY HEALTH CARE CENTRE IN SWEDEN FROM MARCH TO JUNE, 2011. PATIENTS WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO A CONTROL GROUP RECEIVING STANDARD CARE OR A YOGA GROUP TREATED WITH MEDICAL YOGA FOR 1 HOUR, ONCE A WEEK, OVER A 12-WEEK PERIOD IN ADDITION TO THE STANDARD CARE. A TOTAL OF 37 MEN AND WOMEN, MEAN AGE OF 53 +/- 12 YEARS WERE INCLUDED. GENERAL STRESS LEVEL (MEASURED USING PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE (PSS)), BURNOUT (SHIROM-MELAMED BURNOUT QUESTIONNAIRE (SMBQ)), ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION (HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE (HADS)), INSOMNIA SEVERITY (INSOMNIA SEVERITY INDEX (ISI)), PAIN (VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS)), AND OVERALL HEALTH STATUS (EURO QUALITY OF LIFE VAS (EQ-VAS)) WERE MEASURED BEFORE AND AFTER 12 WEEKS. PATIENTS ASSIGNED TO THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENTS ON MEASURES OF GENERAL STRESS LEVEL (P < 0.000), ANXIETY (P < 0.019), AND OVERALL HEALTH STATUS (P < 0.018) COMPARED TO CONTROLS. TREATMENT WITH MEDICAL YOGA IS EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING LEVELS OF STRESS AND ANXIETY IN PATIENTS WITH STRESS-RELATED SYMPTOMS IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
12 1020  39 EFFECTS OF YOGA AND AEROBIC EXERCISE ON ACTIGRAPHIC SLEEP PARAMETERS IN MENOPAUSAL WOMEN WITH HOT FLASHES. STUDY OBJECTIVES: TO DETERMINE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND AEROBIC EXERCISE COMPARED WITH USUAL ACTIVITY ON OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENTS OF SLEEP IN MIDLIFE WOMEN. METHODS: SECONDARY ANALYSES OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IN THE MENOPAUSE STRATEGIES: FINDING LASTING ANSWERS FOR SYMPTOMS AND HEALTH (MSFLASH) NETWORK CONDUCTED AMONG 186 LATE TRANSITION AND POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN AGED 40-62 Y WITH HOT FLASHES. WOMEN WERE RANDOMIZED TO 12 W OF YOGA, SUPERVISED AEROBIC EXERCISE, OR USUAL ACTIVITY. THE MEAN AND COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION (CV) OF CHANGE IN ACTIGRAPH SLEEP MEASURES FROM EACH INTERVENTION GROUP WERE COMPARED TO THE USUAL ACTIVITY GROUP USING LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS. RESULTS: BASELINE VALUES OF THE PRIMARY SLEEP MEASURES FOR THE ENTIRE SAMPLE WERE MEAN TOTAL SLEEP TIME (TST) = 407.5 +/- 56.7 MIN; MEAN WAKE AFTER SLEEP ONSET (WASO) = 54.6 +/- 21.8 MIN; MEAN CV FOR WASO = 37.7 +/- 18.7 AND MEAN CV FOR NUMBER OF LONG AWAKENINGS > 5 MIN = 81.5 +/- 46.9. CHANGES IN THE ACTIGRAPHIC SLEEP OUTCOMES FROM BASELINE TO WEEKS 11-12 WERE SMALL, AND NONE DIFFERED BETWEEN GROUPS. IN AN EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS, WOMEN WITH BASELINE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX HIGHER THAN 8 HAD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED TST-CV FOLLOWING YOGA COMPARED WITH USUAL ACTIVITY. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY ADDS TO THE CURRENTLY SCANT LITERATURE ON OBJECTIVE SLEEP OUTCOMES FROM YOGA AND AEROBIC EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS FOR THIS POPULATION. ALTHOUGH SMALL EFFECTS ON SELF-REPORTED SLEEP QUALITY WERE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE INTERVENTIONS HAD NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON ACTIGRAPH MEASURES, EXCEPT FOR POTENTIALLY IMPROVED SLEEP STABILITY WITH YOGA IN WOMEN WITH POOR SELF-REPORTED SLEEP QUALITY.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
13 1939  39 ROLE OF YOGA THERAPY IN IMPROVING DIGESTIVE HEALTH AND QUALITY OF SLEEP IN AN ELDERLY POPULATION: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: CONSTIPATION AND SLEEP DISTURBANCES COMMONLY AFFECT ELDERLY POPULATION RESULTS IN COMPROMISED PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS LIKE YOGA NOT ONLY ADDRESS THE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH BUT ALSO PROMOTE HEALTHY AGEING. THIS STUDY EVALUATES THE EFFECT OF 3 MONTHS YOGA INTERVENTION ON THE SLEEP AND CONSTIPATION RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AMONG THE ELDERLY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: NINETY SIX PARTICIPANTS AGED BETWEEN 60 AND 75 WHO DID NOT HAD ANY HISTORY OF YOGA PRACTICE FOR PAST 1 YEAR AND HAVING A ZUBROD SCORE OF 0-2 WERE RANDOMIZED IN TO YOGA (N = 48) OR WAITLISTED CONTROL (N = 48). THE YOGA GROUP RECEIVED YOGA INTERVENTIONS AT A FREQUENCY OF 3 SESSIONS PER WEEK FOR 3 MONTHS. PITTSBURG SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI) AND PATIENT ASSESSMENT OF CONSTIPATION QOL (PAC-QOL) WERE USED TO ASSESS THE IMPROVEMENT. INTENTION TO TREAT ANALYSIS METHOD WAS USED TO INCLUDE THE DROP-OUT PARTICIPANTS. RESULTS: EIGHTY ONE PARTICIPANTS (YOGA = 48, WAITLISTED CONTROL = 33) COMPLETED THE STUDY. WILCOXON'S SIGN RANK TEST HAS SHOWN THAT THE YOGA GROUP HAD STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN MOST OF THE PARAMETERS IN PSQI AND PAC-QOL (P </= 0.05). MANN WHITNEY TEST REVEALED THAT YOGA GROUP HAS BETTER IMPROVEMENT IN THE SLEEP QUALITY AND CONSTIPATION RELATED QOL (P </= 0.05) COMPARED TO THE CONTROLS. DISCUSSION: THE RESULTS SIGNIFY YOGA CAN EASE OLD AGE RELATED ISSUES LIKE CONSTIPATION AND INSOMNIA. THIS IS ENCOURAGING FOR INCLUSION OF YOGA AS A DAILY PRACTICE REGIMEN TO IMPROVE THE CONSTIPATION AND SLEEP RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN ELDERLY POPULATION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
14 1542  29 KRIYA YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES DESPITE THE EASY ACCEPTABILITY AND HOLISTIC NATURE OF KRIYA YOGA, THERE ARE NO STUDIES EVALUATING THE ROLE OF KRIYA YOGA INTERVENTION ON DEPRESSION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE CURRENT STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFECT OF ADJUNCTIVE KRIYA YOGA ON DEPRESSION. METHODS PATIENTS WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER WHO OPTED FOR KRIYA YOGA WERE RECRUITED INTO THE INTERVENTION GROUP (ADJUNCTIVE KRIYA YOGA) AND THOSE ON PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION ALONE WERE ENROLLED INTO THE CONTROL GROUP. THE HAMILTON DEPRESSION RATING SCALE (HDRS) MEASUREMENTS WERE RECORDED AT BASELINE, END OF 2, 4, AND 8 WEEKS. RESULTS HDRS SCORES OF THE INTERVENTION GROUP ( N = 29) WERE FOUND TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY LESSER THAN THAT OF THE CONTROL GROUP ( N = 52) BY THE END OF 2, 4, AND 8 WEEKS. THE REMISSION RATE WAS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP. CONCLUSION KRIYA YOGA INTERVENTION WAS FOUND TO BE FEASIBLE, AS WELL AS IMPROVED THE SEVERITY OF DEPRESSION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
15 2508  49 YOGA BREATHING FOR CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY-ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE: RESULTS OF A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: MANY DEBILITATING SYMPTOMS ARISE FROM CANCER AND ITS TREATMENT THAT ARE OFTEN UNRELIEVED BY ESTABLISHED METHODS. PRANAYAMA, A SERIES OF YOGIC BREATHING TECHNIQUES, MAY IMPROVE CANCER-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE, BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED FOR THIS PURPOSE. OBJECTIVES: A PILOT STUDY WAS PERFORMED TO EVALUATE FEASIBILITY AND TO TEST THE EFFECTS OF PRANAYAMA ON CANCER-ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE. DESIGN: THIS WAS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL COMPARING PRANAYAMA TO USUAL CARE. SETTING: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT A UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER. SUBJECTS: PATIENTS RECEIVING CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE PRANAYAMA IMMEDIATELY OR AFTER A WAITING PERIOD (CONTROL GROUP). INTERVENTIONS: THE PRANAYAMA INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF FOUR BREATHING TECHNIQUES TAUGHT IN WEEKLY CLASSES AND PRACTICED AT HOME. THE TREATMENT GROUP RECEIVED PRANAYAMA DURING TWO CONSECUTIVE CYCLES OF CHEMOTHERAPY. THE CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED USUAL CARE DURING THEIR FIRST CYCLE, AND RECEIVED PRANAYAMA DURING THEIR SECOND CYCLE OF CHEMOTHERAPY. OUTCOME MEASURES: FEASIBILITY, CANCER-ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS (FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, STRESS), AND QUALITY OF LIFE WERE THE OUTCOMES. RESULTS: CLASS ATTENDANCE WAS NEARLY 100% IN BOTH GROUPS. SIXTEEN (16) PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL INTENT-TO-TREAT ANALYSES. THE REPEATED-MEASURES ANALYSES DEMONSTRATED THAT ANY INCREASE IN PRANAYAMA DOSE, WITH DOSE MEASURED IN THE NUMBER OF HOURS PRACTICED IN CLASS OR AT HOME, RESULTED IN IMPROVED SYMPTOM AND QUALITY-OF-LIFE SCORES. SEVERAL OF THESE ASSOCIATIONS--SLEEP DISTURBANCE (P=0.04), ANXIETY (P=0.04), AND MENTAL QUALITY OF LIFE (P=0.05)--REACHED OR APPROACHED STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA BREATHING WAS A FEASIBLE INTERVENTION AMONG PATIENTS WITH CANCER RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY. PRANAYAMA MAY IMPROVE SLEEP DISTURBANCE, ANXIETY, AND MENTAL QUALITY OF LIFE. A DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP WAS FOUND BETWEEN PRANAYAMA USE AND IMPROVEMENTS IN CHEMOTHERAPY-ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE. THESE FINDINGS NEED TO BE CONFIRMED IN A LARGER STUDY.	2012	
                                                      
16 2109  32 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS, SYMPTOM CONTROL AND LIFE QUALITY OF ASTHMA PATIENTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. AIM: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO FIND OUT THE EFFECT OF YOGA APPLIED TO ASTHMA PATIENTS ON THE PATIENTS' RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS, SYMPTOM CONTROL AND QUALITY OF LIFE. METHODS: THE SAMPLE OF THE STUDY CONSISTED OF A TOTAL OF RANDOMLY CHOSEN 112 ASTHMA PATIENTS, 56 IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP AND 56 IN THE CONTROL GROUP, WHO MET THE RESEARCH CRITERIA AND WHO AGREED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY. A TOTAL OF 12 YOGA SESSIONS, 2 SESSIONS A WEEK FOR 6 WEEKS, WAS APPLIED TO THE PATIENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP. THE PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT RECEIVE ANY INTERVENTION. RESULTS: IN THE INTRAGROUP COMPARISON OF AVERAGE PRE-TEST AND POST-TEST SCORES OF RESPIRATORY FUNCTION AND ASTHMA CONTROL TEST (ACT) AND ASTHMA QUALITY OF LIFE SCALE (AQLQ) TOTAL AND SUB-DIMENSION SCORES OF THE PATIENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUP, THE DIFFERENCE WAS FOUND TO BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P<0.05). IN ADDITION, POST-TEST SCORE AVERAGES WERE FOUND TO INCREASE IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP, WHILE THEY WERE FOUND TO DECREASE IN THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: IT WAS FOUND THAT YOGA INFLUENCED RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS, SYMPTOM CONTROL AND QUALITY OF LIFE POSITIVELY IN ASTHMA PATIENTS.

17 1076  32 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PHYSIOLOGICAL INDICES, ANXIETY AND SOCIAL FUNCTIONING IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PATIENTS: A RANDOMIZED TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) AS A CHRONIC DISEASE COULD AFFECT PATIENTS' VARIOUS DOMAINS OF LIFE. AIM: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL INDICES, ANXIETY AND SOCIAL FUNCTIONING OF PATIENTS WITH MS IN SOUTHWEST, IRAN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IN THIS CLINICAL TRIAL STUDY, 60 MS PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED ACCORDING TO INCLUSION CRITERIA AND RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO TWO GROUPS OF 30 EACH. PRIOR TO AND AFTER INTERVENTION, THE PATIENTS' VITAL SIGNS WERE MEASURED. FOR CASE GROUP YOGA EXERCISES WERE PERFORMED THREE SESSIONS A WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS WHILE CONTROL GROUP PERFORMED NO EXERCISE. THE DATA WERE GATHERED BY QUESTIONNAIRE AND ANALYSED BY DESCRIPTIVE AND ANALYTICAL STATISTICS IN SPSS. RESULTS: PRIOR TO INTERVENTION, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN FATIGUE SEVERITY AND PAIN BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS BUT THE MEAN FATIGUE SEVERITY AND PAIN IN CASE GROUP DECREASED COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP AFTER THE INTERVENTION. PRIOR TO INTERVENTION, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN MEAN PHYSIOLOGICAL INDICES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS BUT THE MEAN PHYSIOLOGICAL INDICES IN CASE GROUP DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER THE INTERVENTION (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: YOGA IS LIKELY TO INCREASE SELF-EFFICACY OF MS PATIENTS THROUGH ENHANCING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, INCREASING THE STRENGTH OF LOWER LIMBS AND BALANCE, AND DECREASING FATIGUE AND PAIN, AND FINALLY TO PROMOTE SOCIAL FUNCTIONING AND TO RELIEVE STRESS AND ANXIETY IN THESE PATIENTS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
18  428  29 CAN YOGA HAVE ANY EFFECT ON SHOULDER AND ARM PAIN AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER? A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED, SINGLE-BLIND TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SHOULDER AND ARM PAIN, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), DEPRESSION, AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. METHODS: THIS PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED STUDY INCLUDED 42 PATIENTS. THE PATIENTS IN GROUP 1 UNDERWENT A 10-WEEK HATHA YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM. THE PATIENTS IN GROUP 2 WERE INCLUDED IN A 10-WEEK FOLLOW-UP PROGRAM. OUR PRIMARY ENDPOINT WAS ARM AND SHOULDER PAIN INTENSITY. RESULTS: THE GROUP RECEIVING YOGA SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR PAIN SEVERITY FROM BASELINE TO POST-TREATMENT, AND THESE BENEFITS WERE MAINTAINED AT 2.5 MONTHS POST-TREATMENT. WHEN COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP, THERE WERE NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 2 GROUPS WITH RESPECT TO THE PARAMETERS ASSESSED AT THE END OF WEEK 10. CONCLUSION: YOGA WAS AN EFFECTIVE AND SAFE EXERCISE FOR ALLEVIATING SHOULDER AND ARM PAIN, WHICH IS A COMPLICATION WITH A HIGH PREVALENCE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
19 1825  37 PSYCHOLOGICAL ADJUSTMENT AND SLEEP QUALITY IN A RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF THE EFFECTS OF A TIBETAN YOGA INTERVENTION IN PATIENTS WITH LYMPHOMA. BACKGROUND: RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT STRESS-REDUCTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO THE CANCER SETTING HELP PATIENTS COPE WITH THE EFFECTS OF TREATMENT AND IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE. YOGA, AN ANCIENT EASTERN SCIENCE, INCORPORATES STRESS-REDUCTION TECHNIQUES THAT INCLUDE REGULATED BREATHING, VISUAL IMAGERY, AND MEDITATION AS WELL AS VARIOUS POSTURES. THE AUTHORS EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF THE TIBETAN YOGA (TY) PRACTICES OF TSA LUNG AND TRUL KHOR, WHICH INCORPORATE CONTROLLED BREATHING AND VISUALIZATION, MINDFULNESS TECHNIQUES, AND LOW-IMPACT POSTURES IN PATIENTS WITH LYMPHOMA. METHODS: THIRTY-NINE PATIENTS WITH LYMPHOMA WHO WERE UNDERGOING TREATMENT OR WHO HAD CONCLUDED TREATMENT WITHIN THE PAST 12 MONTHS WERE ASSIGNED TO A TY GROUP OR TO A WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP. PATIENTS IN THE TY GROUP PARTICIPATED IN 7 WEEKLY YOGA SESSIONS, AND PATIENTS IN THE WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP WERE FREE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TY PROGRAM AFTER THE 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENT. RESULTS: EIGHTY NINE PERCENT OF TY PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED AT LEAST 2-3 THREE YOGA SESSIONS, AND 58% COMPLETED AT LEAST 5 SESSIONS. PATIENTS IN THE TY GROUP REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER SLEEP DISTURBANCE SCORES DURING FOLLOW-UP COMPARED WITH PATIENTS IN THE WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP (5.8 VS. 8.1; P < 0.004). THIS INCLUDED BETTER SUBJECTIVE SLEEP QUALITY (P < 0.02), FASTER SLEEP LATENCY (P < 0.01), LONGER SLEEP DURATION (P < 0.03), AND LESS USE OF SLEEP MEDICATIONS (P < 0.02). THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS IN TERMS OF INTRUSION OR AVOIDANCE, STATE ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, OR FATIGUE. CONCLUSIONS: THE PARTICIPATION RATES SUGGESTED THAT A TY PROGRAM IS FEASIBLE FOR PATIENTS WITH CANCER AND THAT SUCH A PROGRAM SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES SLEEP-RELATED OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS FOR THE OTHER OUTCOMES.	2004	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
20 1001  32 EFFECTS OF LAUGHTER YOGA ON HEMODIALYSIS PATIENTS' PLASMA-BETA ENDORPHIN LEVELS, PAIN LEVELS AND SLEEP QUALITY: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. THIS STUDY EVALUATES THE EFFECTS OF "LAUGHTER YOGA" ON THE PLASMA BETA-ENDORPHIN LEVELS, PAIN LEVELS AND SLEEP QUALITY OF HEMODIALYSIS PATIENTS. IT IS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. THE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT BETWEEN JULY AND OCTOBER 2018. A TOTAL OF 68 PATIENTS RECEIVING HEMODIALYSIS TREATMENT AT TWO DIFFERENT DIALYSIS CENTERS WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. THE DURATION OF THE LAUGHTER YOGA WAS 30 MIN, AND A TOTAL OF 16 SESSIONS WERE PERFORMED ON A TWICE-WEEKLY BASIS. THE DATA WERE COLLECTED BY USING A SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION FORM, THE VISUAL ANALOG SCALE AND THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX, AND BLOOD SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED TO DETERMINE BETA-ENDORPHIN LEVELS. FOLLOWING THE LAUGHTER YOGA IMPLEMENTATION, THE PAIN LEVEL OF THE INTERVENTION GROUP PATIENTS SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED, AND THEIR SLEEP QUALITY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED. NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE OCCURRED IN THE PATIENTS' BETA-ENDORPHIN LEVELS. LAUGHTER YOGA WAS EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING PAIN AND INCREASING SLEEP QUALITY.	2021

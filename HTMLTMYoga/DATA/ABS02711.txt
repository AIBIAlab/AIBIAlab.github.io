1 2711 102 YOGA KERNELS: A PUBLIC HEALTH MODEL FOR DEVELOPING AND DISSEMINATING EVIDENCE-BASED YOGA PRACTICES. MANY PEOPLE ARE DRAWN TO YOGA FOR ITS POTENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS. WITH ITS RISING POPULARITY, YOGA COULD BECOME A WIDELY USED PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION, BUT ITS SUCCESS DEPENDS ON FINDING EVIDENCE-BASED YOGA PRACTICES THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE AND FEASIBLE FOR A LARGE SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION. COMPLEXITY AND VARIABILITY CREATE BARRIERS TO THE ADOPTION AND MAINTENANCE OF YOGA PRACTICES. IN AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE THE STUDY, ADOPTION, AND MAINTENANCE OF THERAPEUTIC PRACTICES USED IN THE CONTEXT OF PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS, WE INTRODUCE THE CONCEPT OF "YOGA KERNELS," DEFINED AS DISCRETE, EVIDENCE-BASED YOGA PRACTICES THAT ARE AMENABLE TO SCIENTIFIC STUDY AND CAN BE EFFECTIVELY DISSEMINATED AS A PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION. YOGA IS REVIEWED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF A PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION USING THE REACH EFFECTIVENESS ADOPTION IMPLEMENTATION AND MAINTENANCE (RE-AIM) MODEL. THIS MODEL IS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE SUCCESSFUL ADOPTION AND MAINTENANCE OF GENERALIZABLE, EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS. IN RESPONSE TO THE CHALLENGES TO THE ADOPTION AND MAINTENANCE OF YOGA PRACTICES, WE PROPOSE THAT A POTENTIALLY FRUITFUL DIRECTION FOR YOGA RESEARCH IS MOVING AWAY FROM STUDYING YOGA CLASSES TO STUDYING SPECIFIC YOGA PRACTICES THAT ARE SIMPLER AND EASIER FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO USE. YOGA KERNELS COULD BE A UNIFYING CONCEPT TO IDENTIFY THERAPEUTIC USES OF YOGA AND HELP PEOPLE ADOPT AND MAINTAIN THESE PRACTICES AS PART OF A SYSTEMATIC PUBLIC HEALTH STRATEGY.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
2 1937  24 ROLE OF YOGA IN THE TREATMENT OF NEUROTIC DISORDERS: CURRENT STATUS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS. A LARGE NUMBER OF STUDIES HAVE CONSISTENTLY DEMONSTRATED THE POTENTIAL OF YOGA, NOT ONLY IN THE TREATMENT OF PSYCHIATRIC AND PSYCHOSOMATIC DISORDER BUT ALSO IN PROMOTING POSITIVE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. THIS PAPER REVIEWS VARIOUS STUDIES ON THE TREATMENT OF NEUROSIS WITH TECHNIQUES DERIVED FROM YOGA. A FEW LACUNAE HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND POSSIBLE DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH ARE OUTLINED. IT IS HOPED THAT RESEARCH ALONG THESE LINES WILL DEVELOP A STANDARDIZED METHOD OF YOGA THERAPY WHICH CAN BE UTILIZED AND INTEGRATED WITHIN THE EXISTING METHODS OF TREATMENT OF NEUROTIC DISORDERS.	1994	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
3 2556  22 YOGA FOR CHILDREN. THERE IS AN INCREASING INTEREST IN THE USE OF YOGA FOR CHILDREN TO CALM THE MIND AND INCREASE HEALTH AND WELL BEING. DESPITE SCANT BUT INCREASING EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN CHILDREN, SPECIAL YOGA PROGRAMS WITHIN SCHOOLS ARE BEING DEVELOPED FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS. THIS INCREASING POPULARITY OF THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA MAY ENCOURAGE PARENTS TO CONSIDER YOGA FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND REQUEST REFERRALS OR CLARIFICATION OF THE PURPORTED EFFECTS. A DESCRIPTION OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL BASIS OF YOGA, THE BASIC COMPONENTS OF A YOGA PRACTICE, SAFETY CONCERNS, AND HOW TO LOCATE AND EVALUATE A YOGA PROGRAM FOR CHILDREN WILL BE ADDRESSED.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
4 2375  28 WHITE PAPER: YOGA THERAPY AND PAIN-HOW YOGA THERAPY SERVES IN COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT, AND HOW IT CAN DO MORE. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE ROLE OF YOGA THERAPY IN COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT (CIPM). THE PAIN CRISIS IS DESCRIBED, AND HOW YOGA THERAPISTS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO ITS SOLUTION IS EXPLAINED. YOGA THERAPY CAN BE AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF THE MULTIDISCIPLINARY UNDERTAKING THAT WILL BE REQUIRED TO IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES AND ALTER THE TRAJECTORY OF THE GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS CONSTITUTED BY AN EPIDEMIC OF POORLY UNDERSTOOD AND INADEQUATELY ADDRESSED PAIN. ADDITIONAL CONTEXT AND EVIDENCE ARE PRESENTED TO DOCUMENT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTIONS TO SUPPORT PEOPLE LIVING WITH PAIN. THE WHITE PAPER CONCLUDES BY LISTING RECOMMENDATIONS TO PROVIDERS, CONSUMERS, PAYERS, AND LEGISLATORS, WHO TOGETHER CAN ADDRESS SYSTEMIC AND STRUCTURAL BARRIERS TO CIPM, AS WELL AS SUGGESTIONS FOR ENABLING THE YOGA THERAPY PROFESSION TO MORE FULLY PARTICIPATE IN THESE SOLUTIONS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
5 2580  29 YOGA FOR HEALTHY AGING: SCIENCE OR HYPE? YOGA, ONE OF THE WORLD'S OLDEST HEALTH SYSTEMS IS RECEIVING NEW ATTENTION FOR CLAIMS THAT IT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTHY AGING. UNTIL RECENTLY, SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE FOR ITS EFFICACY HAS RELIED HEAVILY ON SMALL AND POORLY-DESIGNED RESEARCH, BUT THIS IS CHANGING. MULTIPLE, WELL-DESIGNED STUDIES PROVIDE DATA SHOWING THAT YOGA PRACTICE HAS POSITIVE EFFECTS ON CELLULAR AGING, MOBILITY, BALANCE, MENTAL HEALTH, AND PREVENTION OF COGNITIVE DECLINE-ALL AREAS OF CONCERN FOR OLDER ADULTS. SINCE THE COST OF IMPLEMENTING YOGA-BASED COMMUNITY AND HOME-BASED INTERVENTIONS IS LOW-POLICYMAKERS ARE ALSO EYEING YOGA PRACTICE AS A COST-EFFECTIVE WAY TO REDUCE MEDICAL COSTS AND IMPROVE OUTCOMES AMONG A GROWING AGING POPULATION. THIS COMMENTARY REVIEWS THE EVIDENCE FOR BOTH PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS FROM YOGA, AS WELL AS CONCERNS ABOUT INJURIES THAT HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN TYPES OF YOGA PRACTICE. IT REVEALS A SURPRISING RANGE OF YOGA PROGRAMS AND DIFFICULTY LEVELS THAT PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALMOST ANYONE TO PARTICIPATE AND GAIN HEALTH BENEFITS WITH PRACTICE.	2021

CURRENT RESEARCH ON YOGA FOR OA IS SCANT BUT PROMISING, SHOWING SOME EVIDENCE OF REDUCED PAIN, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, AND DISABILITY. THE CONCEPTUAL MODEL DESCRIBED HERE PROPOSES MUSCULOSKELETAL EFFECTS (STRENGTHENING, FLEXIBILITY, RELAXATION), REDUCTION OF AUTONOMIC AROUSAL, AND THERAPEUTIC COGNITIVE PATTERNS (DISTRACTION, MINDFULNESS) AS POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT MECHANISMS OF YOGA. THIS ARTICLE ALSO DESCRIBES CONSIDERATIONS FOR PATIENTS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WHEN EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL USEFULNESS AND SAFETY OF YOGA PROGRAMS: YOGA STYLE, INSTRUCTOR QUALIFICATIONS, AND AMOUNT OF TIME SPENT IN YOGA PRACTICE.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
8 2554  29 YOGA FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE'S MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING: RESEARCH REVIEW AND REFLECTIONS ON THE MENTAL HEALTH POTENTIALS OF YOGA. THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES YOGA AS A POTENTIAL TOOL FOR CHILDREN TO DEAL WITH STRESS AND REGULATE THEMSELVES. YOGA PROVIDES TRAINING OF MIND AND BODY TO BRING EMOTIONAL BALANCE. WE ARGUE THAT CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE NEED SUCH TOOLS TO LISTEN INWARD TO THEIR BODIES, FEELINGS, AND IDEAS. YOGA MAY ASSIST THEM IN DEVELOPING IN SOUND WAYS, TO STRENGTHEN THEMSELVES, AND BE CONTRIBUTING SOCIAL BEINGS. FIRST, WE ADDRESS HOW CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE IN TODAY'S WORLD FACE NUMEROUS EXPECTATIONS AND CONSTANT STIMULATION THROUGH THE INTERNET AND OTHER MEDIA AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES. ONE REASON WHY CHILDREN EXPERIENCE STRESS AND MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES IS THAT GLOBALIZATION EXPOSES THE YOUTH ALL OVER THE WORLD TO VARIOUS NEW DEMANDS, STANDARDS, AND OPTIONS. THERE IS ALSO INCREASED PRESSURE TO SUCCEED IN SCHOOL, PARTLY DUE TO INCREASED COMPETITION BUT ALSO A DIVERSE RANGE OF OPTIONS AVAILABLE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE IN CONTEMPORARY TIMES THAN IN THE PAST. OUR ARGUMENT ALSO PARTIALLY RESTS ON THE FACT THAT MODERN SOCIETY OFFERS PLENTY OF DISTRACTIONS AND UNWELCOME ATTRACTIONS, ESPECIALLY LINKED TO NEW MEDIA TECHNOLOGIES. THE DOMINANT PRESENCE OF MULTIMEDIA DEVICES AND THE TIME SPENT ON THEM BY CHILDREN ARE CLEAR INDICATORS OF THE SHIFT IN LIFESTYLES AND PRIORITIES OF OUR NEW GENERATION. WHILE THESE MEDIA TECHNOLOGIES ARE VALUABLE RESOURCES IN CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE'S LIVES FOR COMMUNICATION, LEARNING, AND ENTERTAINMENT, THEY ALSO RESULT IN CONSTANT COMPETITION FOR YOUNGSTER'S ATTENTION. A MAIN CONCEPT IN OUR ARTICLE IS THAT YOGA MAY HELP CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE COPE WITH STRESS AND THUS, CONTRIBUTE POSITIVELY TO BALANCE IN LIFE, WELL-BEING, AND MENTAL HEALTH. WE PRESENT RESEARCH LITERATURE SUGGESTING THAT YOGA IMPROVES CHILDREN'S PHYSICAL AND MENTAL WELL-BEING. SIMILARLY, YOGA IN SCHOOLS HELPS STUDENTS IMPROVE RESILIENCE, MOOD, AND SELF-REGULATION SKILLS PERTAINING TO EMOTIONS AND STRESS.	2014	

9 2630  22 YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION: FIVE QUESTIONS TO MOVE THE EVIDENCE-BASE FORWARD. YOGA-BASED PRACTICES, DERIVED FROM ANCIENT EASTERN MIND-BODY PRACTICES, HAVE GROWN IN POPULARITY IN THE WEST OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES. INCREASING EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFECTS OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS (YBIS). HOWEVER, DESPITE YOGA'S PROMISE AS A POTENTIAL TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION, THE LITERATURE TO DATE IS MARKED BY SUBSTANTIAL METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS, WHICH REMAIN A BARRIER TO THE INTEGRATION OF YBIS INTO CONVENTIONAL CLINICAL CARE. WE HIGHLIGHT FIVE KEY AREAS OF STUDY THAT NEED FURTHER INVESTIGATION TO FILL CRUCIAL GAPS IN THE LITERATURE-BASE TO ADVANCE YOGA RESEARCH AND YOGA'S POTENTIAL AS AN EFFECTIVE EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
10 1992  27 STAFF PERSPECTIVES REGARDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A YOGA INTERVENTION WITH CHRONIC PAIN SELF-MANAGEMENT IN A CLINICAL SETTING. CHRONIC PAIN AFFECTS MILLIONS OF AMERICANS AND CAN BE ADDRESSED THROUGH MULTIPLE MODALITIES, INTERVENTIONS, AND STRATEGIES. YOGA AND SELF-MANAGEMENT HAVE BEEN PROVEN EFFECTIVE IN TREATING CHRONIC PAIN, BUT LITTLE RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONDUCTED ON THE FEASIBILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS RELATED TO THESE ALTERNATIVE INTERVENTION FORMS. IN OUR QUALITATIVE STUDY, WE EXAMINED STAFF PERCEPTIONS REGARDING THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING YOGA ALONG WITH ESTABLISHED SELF-MANAGEMENT AT A PAIN MANAGEMENT CLINIC IN COLORADO. WE UTILIZED THE IMPLEMENTATION DRIVERS OF COMPETENCY, ORGANIZATIONAL, AND LEADERSHIP, AND OUR ADDED HYPOTHETICAL DRIVER TO EXPLORE BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS RELATED TO PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT POSITIVE STAFF AND PATIENT ATTITUDES WERE CRUCIAL FOR SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION. WE ALSO IDENTIFIED PHYSICAL SPACE, TRANSPORTATION, AND SUPPORTIVE LEADERSHIP AS NECESSARY COMPONENTS OF PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION. FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO EXAMINE BARRIERS SUCH AS FUNDING TO ENSURE INTERVENTION SUSTAINABILITY AND THE NEED FOR ADEQUATE STAFFING.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
11 2908  17 [PHYSICAL EXERCISE AND YOGA IN PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF ADDICTIVE DISEASES]. PREVENTION OF ADDICTIVE DISEASES SHOULD BE COMPLEX AND SYSTEMATIC AND IT SHOULD INCLUDE TRAINING OF SOCIAL SKILLS, DECISION-MAKING SKILLS, FAMILY INTERVENTION, ETC. SIMILARLY, EFFECTIVE TREATMENT IS USUALLY LONG-TERM, SYSTEMATIC AND COMPLEX. PHYSICAL EXERCISE AND YOGA CAN BE USEFUL COMPONENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT PROGRAMMES. ON THE OTHER HAND, COMPETITIVE PROFESSIONAL SPORT RATHER INCREASES THE NUMBER OF RISK FACTORS FOR SUBSTANCE-RELATED PROBLEMS. PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE USE OF YOGA IN SUBSTANCE DEPENDENT PATIENTS AND PATHOLOGICAL GAMBLES ARE MENTIONED.

THE MAIN CONTRIBUTION OF THIS STUDY IS THAT IT IS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW IN THE AREA OF 'YOGA AND ITS ROLE IN MANAGING THE CONSEQUENCES OF WORK STRESS' COLLATING THE DISPERSED KNOWLEDGE IN THIS AREA BY INDICATING THE VARIOUS UNDERSTUDIED STAND-ALONE AND COMBINED CONSEQUENCES OF WORK STRESS AND THE LESS RESEARCHED SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT IN YOGA AND YOGA PRACTICES ADMINISTERED TO MANAGE THESE CONSEQUENCES OF WORK STRESS, TO PROVIDE PROMISING AVENUES FOR FURTHER EXAMINATION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS RESEARCH FIELD.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
14 1213  27 EXPLORING PERCEIVED BENEFITS, MOTIVES, BARRIERS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRESCRIBING YOGA EXERCISES AS A NONPHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION FOR PATIENTS WITH EPILEPSY: A QUALITATIVE STUDY FROM PALESTINE. OBJECTIVES: YOGA IS BELIEVED TO PLAY A ROLE IN STABILIZING THE ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM AND THE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM, THUS MIGHT HELP CONTROL SEIZURES IN PEOPLE WITH EPILEPSY (PWE). THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO EXPLORE EXPERIENCES OF PALESTINIAN PWE WITH REGARD TO BENEFITS, MOTIVES, BARRIERS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF PRESCRIBING YOGA EXERCISES AS A NONPHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION. METHODS: PURPOSIVE AND SNOWBALL SAMPLING TECHNIQUES WERE USED TO RECRUIT PWE WHO PRACTICED YOGA. SEMI-STRUCTURED IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS (N=18) WERE CONDUCTED WITH THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS. THE INTERPRETIVE DESCRIPTION METHOD WAS USED TO QUALITATIVELY ANALYZE THE DATA COLLECTED DURING THE INTERVIEWS. RESULTS: FOLLOWING THE THEMATIC ANALYSIS ADOPTED FOR THIS STUDY, FOUR MAJOR THEMES EMERGED. THESE THEMES WERE AS FOLLOWS: PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF YOGA, MOTIVES TO PRACTICE YOGA, BARRIERS TO PRACTICE YOGA, AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON EFFECTIVE YOGA PRACTICE FOR PWE. THE PERCEIVED BENEFITS INCLUDED IMPROVEMENTS IN MANAGEMENT OF SEIZURES, PSYCHOLOGICAL, PHYSICAL, AND SOCIAL WELL-BEING. PEOPLE WITH EPILEPSY WERE MOTIVATED BY THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF YOGA. BARRIERS OF ADHERENCE TO PRACTICE INCLUDED PERSONAL AND LOGISTIC FACTORS. THE INTERVIEWEES RECOMMENDED TAILORING YOGA SESSIONS TO THE NEEDS OF PWE. CONCLUSION: THIS EXPLORATIVE QUALITATIVE STUDY REPORTED PERCEIVED BENEFITS, MOTIVES, BARRIERS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF YOGA AS A NONPHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION FOR PWE. PEOPLE WITH EPILEPSY USED YOGA AS A BENEFICIAL NONPHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH AND REDUCE THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF EPILEPSY ON THEIR PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL-BEING. FUTURE STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO INVESTIGATE THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF YOGA WHEN SESSIONS ARE TAILORED TO THE NEEDS OF PWE.	2020	
                                                                                    
15 1587  20 MEDICAL YOGA THERAPY. MEDICAL YOGA IS DEFINED AS THE USE OF YOGA PRACTICES FOR THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF MEDICAL CONDITIONS. BEYOND THE PHYSICAL ELEMENTS OF YOGA, WHICH ARE IMPORTANT AND EFFECTIVE FOR STRENGTHENING THE BODY, MEDICAL YOGA ALSO INCORPORATES APPROPRIATE BREATHING TECHNIQUES, MINDFULNESS, AND MEDITATION IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE MAXIMUM BENEFITS. MULTIPLE STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT YOGA CAN POSITIVELY IMPACT THE BODY IN MANY WAYS, INCLUDING HELPING TO REGULATE BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS, IMPROVE MUSCULOSKELETAL AILMENTS AND KEEPING THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM IN TUNE. IT ALSO HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE IMPORTANT PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFITS, AS THE PRACTICE OF YOGA CAN HELP TO INCREASE MENTAL ENERGY AND POSITIVE FEELINGS, AND DECREASE NEGATIVE FEELINGS OF AGGRESSIVENESS, DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
16 1956  21 SELF-CARE AND YOGA-ACADEMIC-PRACTICE COLLABORATION FOR OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH. HIGH RATES OF STRESS AND BURNOUT AMONG NURSES AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS JUSTIFY THE EXPLORATION OF INNOVATIVE INTERVENTIONS DESIGNED TO REDUCE STRESS AND PROMOTE SELF-CARE AMONG THIS POPULATION. A GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA AND SUGGESTS THE POTENTIAL FOR YOGA TO SUPPORT SELF-CARE AND REDUCE STRESS AMONG HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE FORMATION OF AN ACADEMIC-PRACTICE COLLABORATION TO USE YOGA AS A MODEL FOR OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS AMONG NURSES EMPLOYED AT A TAX-SUPPORTED URBAN HEALTH SYSTEM. IN ADDITION, RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PROGRAM SUSTAINABILITY OVER TIME ARE DISCUSSED.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
17  242  26 A WELLBEING SKILL: MOVING ATTENTIVELY IN HOSPITAL YOGA PRACTICE. YOGA IS SOMETIMES INTERPRETED AS MEDICAL THERAPY AND THE EVIDENCE FROM BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH INDICATES THAT IT CAN BE USEFUL IN A BROAD RANGE OF HEALTH CONDITIONS. YOGA, HOWEVER, CAN ALSO BE PURSUED AS A PROCESS-ORIENTED CONTEMPLATIVE PRACTICE. THIS ARTICLE DRAWS ON PARTICIPANT OBSERVATION-BASED RESEARCH WITH YOGA PRACTITIONERS AT TWO HOSPITALS, ONE IN PONDICHERRY, INDIA, AND ONE IN FUKUI, JAPAN. IT EXPLORES HOW PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES AT THESE HEALTHCARE INSTITUTIONS ARE INVITED TO MOVE WITHOUT ANTICIPATING AN OUTCOME AND TO CULTIVATE ATTITUDES SUCH AS CONTENTMENT AND NON-VIOLENCE. TAKING CUES FROM RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS' APPROACHES TO YOGA AS A SKILL AND FROM ANTHROPOLOGICAL UNDERSTANDINGS OF SKILL, YOGA IS CONSIDERED HERE AS A CAPACITY OF MOVING WITH AWARENESS. A SKILL-BASED APPROACH ALLOWS PRACTITIONERS TO TRY OUT YOGIC TECHNIQUES ACCORDING TO THEIR PERSONAL ABILITIES AND NEEDS. THE ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT, IN THE CONTEXTS DISCUSSED, YOGA PRACTITIONERS PURSUE WELLBEING NOT AS AN INDIVIDUAL THERAPEUTIC GOAL BUT AS MUTUAL EXPLORATIVE LEARNING.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
18  347  29 ASSESSING FIDELITY OF IMPLEMENTATION (FOI) FOR SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA INTERVENTIONS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. AS SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PROGRAMS GAIN POPULARITY, THE SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF FIDELITY OF PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION (FOI) IS CRITICAL TO PROVIDE A MORE ROBUST UNDERSTANDING OF THE CORE COMPONENTS OF MINDFULNESS AND YOGA INTERVENTIONS, THEIR POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE SPECIFIED TEACHER AND STUDENT OUTCOMES, AND OUR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT THESE PROGRAMS CONSISTENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY. THIS PAPER REVIEWS THE CURRENT STATE OF THE SCIENCE WITH RESPECT TO INCLUSION AND REPORTING OF FOI IN PEER-REVIEWED STUDIES EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND/OR YOGA PROGRAMS TARGETING STUDENTS AND/OR TEACHERS IMPLEMENTED IN GRADES KINDERGARTEN THROUGH TWELVE (K-12) IN NORTH AMERICA. ELECTRONIC SEARCHES IN PSYCHINFO AND WEB OF SCIENCE FROM THEIR INCEPTION THROUGH MAY 2014, IN ADDITION TO HAND SEARCHES OF RELEVANT REVIEW ARTICLES, IDENTIFIED 312 PUBLICATIONS, 48 OF WHICH MET INCLUSION CRITERIA. FINDINGS INDICATED A RELATIVE PAUCITY OF RIGOROUS FOI. FEWER THAN 10% OF STUDIES OUTLINED POTENTIAL CORE PROGRAM COMPONENTS OR REFERENCED A FORMAL THEORY OF ACTION, AND FEWER THAN 20% ASSESSED ANY ASPECT OF FOI BEYOND PARTICIPANT DOSAGE. THE EMERGING NATURE OF THE EVIDENCE BASE PROVIDES A CRITICAL WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY TO GRAPPLE WITH KEY ISSUES RELEVANT TO FOI OF MINDFULNESS-BASED AND YOGA PROGRAMS, INCLUDING IDENTIFYING ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT SHOULD BE FAITHFULLY IMPLEMENTED AND HOW WE MIGHT DEVELOP RIGOROUS MEASURES TO ACCURATELY CAPTURE THEM. CONSIDERATION OF THESE QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTED NEXT STEPS ARE INTENDED TO HELP ADVANCE THE EMERGING FIELD OF SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA INTERVENTIONS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
19  296  32 ALIGNING YOGA WITH ITS EVOLVING ROLE IN HEALTH CARE: COMMENTS ON YOGA PRACTICE, POLICY, RESEARCH. EVIDENCE IS ACCUMULATING THAT SUGGESTS THAT YOGA HAS BENEFICIAL EFFECTS IN MITIGATING THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN DISEASES. AS A RESULT, EFFORTS ARE BEING MADE TO MEDICALIZE YOGA AND USE IT WITHIN INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE AS A THERAPY. HOWEVER, THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL SHORTCOMINGS IN THE PRACTICE, POLICY, AND RESEARCH OF YOGA THAT UNDERMINE ITS OPTIMAL USE. YOGA AS A MODALITY FUNCTIONS WITHIN A CONTEXT. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO OCCASIONALLY STEP BACK AND EXAMINE THE ENTIRETY OF THE CONTEXT FROM A HIGH VANTAGE TO ASSESS WHETHER THE TACTICAL AND PROGRAMMATIC ENDEAVORS ARE ALIGNED WITH THE STRATEGIC INTENDED PURPOSE. THIS COMMENTARY DISCUSSES A FEW POLICY ISSUES RELEVANT TO SOME KEY STAKEHOLDERS. IT SUGGESTS THAT YOGA THERAPISTS NEED TO CALIBRATE THEIR MODEL OF YOGA BY REDUCING EMPHASIS ON POSTURES AND INCREASING IT ON MEDITATION AND BREATHING EXERCISES WHILE CATERING TO CLIENTS WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS. IT RECOMMENDS THAT YOGA RESEARCH SHOULD BE MORE CRITICAL IN EVALUATING YOGA'S FUNDAMENTAL TENETS AND USE REDUCTIONIST APPROACH TO DO SO. IT PROPOSES THAT AUTONOMOUS REGULATORS SHOULD EXTRICATE INJURY PRONE POSTURES FROM THE BODY OF YOGA PRACTICE FOR REGULATORY PURPOSES, RATHER THAN REGULATE YOGA SUMMARILY. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT PAYERS SHOULD PAY FOR YOGA. HOWEVER, THEY SHOULD USE PAYMENT MODEL AS IT IS USED FOR VACCINATION, INSTEAD OF PAYING AS IT IS DONE FOR PHYSIOTHERAPY. IT CONCLUDES THAT YOGA CAN HELP, BUT BEFORE IT CAN HELP IT NEEDS HELP ITSELF, AND THE VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS NEED TO REFLECT ON THE BIG PICTURE SO THAT THEY CAN COLLABORATE ON THESE IMPROVEMENTS.	2017

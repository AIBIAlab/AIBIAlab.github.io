1 1546 72 LATE ANTERIOR PROSTHETIC HIP DISLOCATION DUE TO YOGA. THE POPULARITY OF YOGA AND THE PREVALENCE OF TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY (THA) HAVE SIMULTANEOUSLY INCREASED IN THE UNITED STATES. ACCORDINGLY, ONE CAN ASSUME THAT THE NUMBER OF THA PATIENTS PRACTICING YOGA HAS INCREASED. CERTAIN YOGA POSES REACH THE EXTREMES OF HIP RANGE OF MOTION, POTENTIALLY LEAVING PATIENTS VULNERABLE TO DISLOCATION. TO DATE, 2 CASES OF LATE POSTERIOR PROSTHETIC HIP DISLOCATIONS DURING YOGA HAVE BEEN REPORTED; HOWEVER, THERE HAVE BEEN NO REPORTS OF ANTERIOR PROSTHETIC HIP DISLOCATIONS. WE PRESENT ONE CASE OF LATE ANTERIOR PROSTHETIC HIP DISLOCATION DURING YOGA IN A PATIENT WHO UNDERWENT THA VIA THE DIRECT ANTERIOR APPROACH. PROSTHETIC HIP DISLOCATION DURING YOGA MAY BE A GROWING CONCERN. WE PROVIDE ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THA PATIENTS TO SAFELY PRACTICE YOGA.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
2 1547 38 LATE TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY DISLOCATION DUE TO YOGA. YOGA HAS BECOME A POPULAR FORM OF EXERCISE, RECREATION, AND MEDITATION FOR ADULTS IN THE UNITED STATES. AS THE POPULARITY OF BOTH YOGA AND THE INCIDENCE OF HIP REPLACEMENTS HAVE BOTH COINCIDENTALLY INCREASED OVER THE LAST 2 DECADES, WE IMAGINE THAT THE NUMBER OF TOTAL HIP REPLACEMENT PATIENTS PARTAKING IN THE PRACTICE OF YOGA HAS ALSO INCREASED. THERE ARE NO CLEAR GUIDELINES AVAILABLE FOR YOGA PRACTICE FOLLOWING HIP REPLACEMENT. TO DATE, THERE HAVE BEEN NO PUBLISHED REPORTS OF PROSTHETIC HIP DISLOCATIONS DURING YOGA. WE PRESENT 2 CASES OF LATE TOTAL HIP DISLOCATIONS DURING YOGA AND PROVIDE A REVIEW OF THE AVAILABLE ORTHOPAEDIC LITERATURE AND OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ON PATIENT RESTRICTIONS AND EDUCATION WITH RESPECT TO PRACTICING YOGA AFTER A HIP REPLACEMENT.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
3 1991 23 SPINE FUSIONS, YOGA INSTRUCTORS, AND HIP FRACTURES: THE ROLE OF DUAL MOBILITY IN PRIMARY TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY. BACKGROUND: DESPITE THE INCREASED USE OF DUAL MOBILITY (DM) IN PRIMARY TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY (THA), DEBATE EXISTS REGARDING THE INDICATIONS FOR ITS USE. NO SPECIFIC ALGORITHM EXISTS TO GUIDE THIS DECISION-MAKING PROCESS. THEREFORE, THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO SUMMARIZE THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE LITERATURE REGARDING THE USE OF DM IN PRIMARY THA AND PROVIDE EVIDENCE-BASED GUIDELINES BASED ON SPECIFIC PATIENT POPULATIONS AND RISK FACTORS FOR INSTABILITY. METHODS: WE REVIEWED THE CURRENT LITERATURE FOR STUDIES EVALUATING RISK FACTORS FOR DISLOCATION IN PRIMARY THA, AS WELL AS THE CLINICAL USE AND RESULTS OF DM IN PRIMARY THA. BASED ON THE STRENGTH OF THE LITERATURE, WE DISCUSS THE USE OF DM IN SPECIFIC PATIENT POPULATIONS. WE PROVIDE A DECISION-MAKING ALGORITHM TO DETERMINE WHETHER A PATIENT MAY BE INDICATED FOR DM IN PRIMARY THA. RESULTS: SURGEONS SHOULD CONSIDER PREOPERATIVE PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS, RISK FACTORS FOR INSTABILITY (EG, SIGNIFICANT HIP-SPINE ISSUES), TYPE OF PROCEDURE TO BE PERFORMED (EG, CONVERSION ARTHROPLASTY), AND INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY (EG, THA FOR FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE). BASED ON THIS ALGORITHMIC ASSESSMENT, DM MAY BE WARRANTED IN THE PRIMARY THA SETTING IF A PATIENT'S COMBINED RISK REACHES AN ESTABLISHED THRESHOLD BASED ON THE LITERATURE. CONCLUSION: THIS EVIDENCE-BASED ALGORITHM MAY HELP GUIDE CURRENT PRACTICE IN THE USE OF DM IN PRIMARY THA. WE ADVOCATE THE CONTINUED JUDICIOUS USE OF DM IN HIP ARTHROPLASTY. LONGER TERM STUDIES ARE NEEDED IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE DURABILITY OF DM, AS WELL AS ANY COMPLICATIONS RELATED TO THE DM ARTICULATION.	2021	

4 1906 26 RETURNING TO YOGA PRACTICE AND TEACHING AFTER TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY. PATIENTS WHO PRACTICE YOGA ARE MOTIVATED TO RETURN TO PRACTICE AFTER TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY (THA). WITH CASE REPORTS OF DISLOCATIONS DURING YOGA, THE SAFETY OF SUCH A RETURN IS UNCLEAR. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXAMINE THE TIMING AND FEASIBILITY OF A RETURN IN A SUBSET OF HIGHLY EXPERIENCED AND MOTIVATED PATIENTS. BETWEEN 2010 AND 2019, A TOTAL OF 19 THA'S PERFORMED IN 14 PATIENTS WHO SELF-IDENTIFIED AS YOGA INSTRUCTORS WERE RETROSPECTIVELY REVIEWED. PATIENTS WHO PRACTICED YOGA BUT WERE NOT TEACHERS WERE EXCLUDED FROM THIS SERIES. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES WERE THE ABILITY TO RETURN TO YOGA, TO RESUME TEACHING, AND FLUENCY WITH 14 CLASSIC POSES. SECONDARY OUTCOMES MEASURED WERE PATIENT-REPORTED HIP DISABILITY AND OSTEOARTHRITIS OUTCOME SCORE (HOOS, JR.), COMPLICATIONS, AND RADIOGRAPHIC POSITION OF THE IMPLANTS. AFTER SURGERY, ALL PATIENTS RETURNED TO PRACTICING AND TEACHING YOGA, AND THE MEAN TIME TO EACH WAS 2 MONTHS. ALL PATIENTS WERE ABLE TO PERFORM ALL 14 CLASSIC POSES. AT A MEAN FOLLOW-UP OF 5 YEARS (SD +/- 4), THERE WERE NO COMPLICATIONS, AND THE MEAN HOOS, JR SCORE WAS 92 POINTS (SD +/- 15). THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT A RETURN TO YOGA IN AN EXPERIENCED POPULATION IS NOT ONLY POSSIBLE BUT ALSO SAFE AFTER A DIRECT ANTERIOR THA. LIMITATIONS IN PERFORMING THE POSES SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD, AND APPROPRIATE MODIFICATIONS SHOULD BE INCORPORATED WHEN NEEDED.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
5 2393 14 YOGA AND BONE HEALTH. OSTEOPOROSIS IS A PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM AFFECTING INDIVIDUALS GLOBALLY. YOGA HAS BEEN FOUND TO PREVENT AND REVERSE BONE LOSS. YOGA MAY RESULT IN BETTER BALANCE, IMPROVED POSTURE, AND GREATER RANGE OF MOTION, STRENGTH, AND COORDINATION, ALL FACTORS THAT ALSO MITIGATE THE RISK OF FALLS AND FRACTURES. A 12-MINUTE, 12-POSE YOGA REGIMEN IS DISCUSSED IN DETAIL. ONCE LEARNED, THE ONGOING USE OF YOGA IS SAFE, WITHOUT COST, AND MAY BE DONE LIFELONG.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
6 1655 18 MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURIES IN YOGA. WHILE YOGA HAS BEEN WIDELY STUDIED FOR ITS BENEFITS TO MANY HEALTH CONDITIONS, LITTLE RESEARCH HAS BEEN PERFORMED ON THE NATURE OF MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURIES OCCURRING DURING YOGA PRACTICE. YOGA IS CONSIDERED TO BE GENERALLY SAFE, HOWEVER, INJURY CAN OCCUR IN NEARLY ANY PART OF THE BODY-ESPECIALLY THE NECK, SHOULDERS, LUMBAR SPINE, HAMSTRINGS, AND KNEES. AS BROAD INTEREST IN YOGA GROWS, SO WILL THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS PRESENTING WITH YOGA-RELATED INJURIES. IN THIS LITERATURE REVIEW, THE PREVALENCE, TYPES OF INJURIES, FORMS OF YOGA RELATED WITH INJURY, SPECIFIC POSES (ASANAS) ASSOCIATED WITH INJURY, AND PREVENTIVE MEASURES ARE DISCUSSED IN ORDER TO FAMILIARIZE PRACTITIONERS WITH YOGA-RELATED INJURIES.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
7 2015 17 SUGGESTIONS FOR ADAPTING YOGA TO THE NEEDS OF OLDER ADULTS WITH OSTEOPOROSIS. BACKGROUND: EXERCISE SUCH AS YOGA MAY HAVE HEALTH BENEFITS FOR OLDER ADULTS WITH OSTEOPOROSIS, BUT WITHOUT ATTENTION TO SAFE MOVEMENT YOGA CAN ALSO INCREASE THE RISK FOR INJURY. OBJECTIVE: THE CURRENT ARTICLE PROVIDES SUGGESTIONS FOR HOW TO ADAPT YOGA TO THE NEEDS OF OLDER ADULTS WITH OSTEOPOROSIS. SUGGESTIONS: A GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR EXERCISE IS THAT OLDER ADULTS WITH OSTEOPOROSIS SHOULD PARTICIPATE IN A MULTICOMPONENT EXERCISE PROGRAM, INCLUDING RESISTANCE AND BALANCE TRAINING. CONTRAINDICATED MOVEMENTS INCLUDE END-RANGE FLEXION/EXTENSION/ROTATION OF THE SPINE AND INTERNAL/EXTERNAL ROTATION OF THE HIP. YOGA POSTURES THAT SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED INCLUDE POSTURES EMPHASIZING SPINAL ALIGNMENT AND EXTENSION TO MID-RANGE IN STANDING AND ON THE FLOOR. OVERARCHING CONSIDERATIONS FOR PARTICIPATION IN YOGA ARE THAT CLASSES SHOULD BE DESIGNED FOR HIGHER-RISK OLDER ADULTS, LED BY AN INSTRUCTOR WHO HAS HAD PROPER TRAINING WITH INDIVIDUALS WITH OSTEOPOROSIS, SHOULD BE A NONCOMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, AND SHOULD GIVE ATTENTION TO WHICH POSTURES ARE SAFE AND HOW TO TRANSITION SAFELY.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
8 1757 22 POSITION OF THE HIP IN YOGA. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS GROWING IN POPULARITY AS A FORM OF EXERCISE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. ORTHOPEDIC PATIENTS PARTICIPATE IN YOGA, YET LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE RANGES-OF-MOTION OF THE HIP WITHIN VARIOUS YOGA POSES. ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS ARE UNSURE ABOUT WHAT POTENTIAL POSITIONS THEIR PATIENTS ARE PLACING THEIR HIPS DURING A YOGA PRACTICE. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO QUANTIFY THE DEGREE OF HIP MOTION WITH COMMON YOGA POSES. METHODS: TWENTY HEALTHY, REGULAR PRACTITIONERS OF YOGA PERFORMED 11 DIFFERENT YOGA POSES IN A STANDARDIZED FASHION. MOTION ANALYSIS WAS USED TO CAPTURE RANGE-OF-MOTION OF THE HIP DURING EACH POSE. RESULTS: MANY YOGA POSES PUT THE HIP IN EXTREMES OF MOTION. POSES SUCH AS DOWNWARD DOG, FORWARD FOLD, SEATED TWIST, AND PIGEON STRESSED THE HIP IN FLEXION. WARRIOR 1, WARRIOR 2, CRESCENT LUNGE, PIGEON, AND TRIANGLE STRESSED THE HIP IN EXTENSION. EAGLE AND SEATED TWIST PUT THE HIP IN HIGHER ADDUCTION, WHILE HALF MOON, EAGLE, AND TRIANGLE PRODUCED MORE HIP INTERNAL ROTATION. CONCLUSION: MANY POSES WERE FOUND TO REACH EXTREMES OF HIP MOTION. THIS STUDY MAY HELP GUIDE THE ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON IN COUNSELING HIP ARTHROPLASTY AND HIP IMPINGEMENT PATIENTS ABOUT YOGA-RELATED ACTIVITY. BY KNOWING WHICH POSES POTENTIALLY STRESS THE HIP IN PARTICULAR PLANES OF MOTION, SURGEONS MAY BETTER INFORM THEIR PATIENTS WHO ARE RETURNING TO YOGA AFTER INJURY OR SURGERY.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
9 2556 16 YOGA FOR CHILDREN. THERE IS AN INCREASING INTEREST IN THE USE OF YOGA FOR CHILDREN TO CALM THE MIND AND INCREASE HEALTH AND WELL BEING. DESPITE SCANT BUT INCREASING EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN CHILDREN, SPECIAL YOGA PROGRAMS WITHIN SCHOOLS ARE BEING DEVELOPED FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS. THIS INCREASING POPULARITY OF THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA MAY ENCOURAGE PARENTS TO CONSIDER YOGA FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND REQUEST REFERRALS OR CLARIFICATION OF THE PURPORTED EFFECTS. A DESCRIPTION OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL BASIS OF YOGA, THE BASIC COMPONENTS OF A YOGA PRACTICE, SAFETY CONCERNS, AND HOW TO LOCATE AND EVALUATE A YOGA PROGRAM FOR CHILDREN WILL BE ADDRESSED.	2009

11 2033 21 TEACHING YOGA TO SENIORS: ESSENTIAL CONSIDERATIONS TO ENHANCE SAFETY AND REDUCE RISK IN A UNIQUELY VULNERABLE AGE GROUP. BACKGROUND: SENIORS AGE 65 AND OLDER REPRESENT THE FASTEST-GROWING SECTOR OF THE POPULATION AND, LIKE MANY AMERICANS, ARE INCREASINGLY DRAWN TO YOGA. THIS PRESENTS BOTH AN EXTRAORDINARY OPPORTUNITY AND A SERIOUS CHALLENGE FOR YOGA INSTRUCTORS WHO MUST BE BOTH A RESOURCE AND GUARDIANS OF SAFETY FOR THIS UNIQUELY VULNERABLE GROUP. A TYPICAL CLASS OF SENIORS IS LIKELY TO REPRESENT THE MOST DIVERSE MIX OF ABILITIES OF ANY AGE GROUP. WHILE SOME MAY BE EXCEEDINGLY HEALTHY, MOST FIT THE PROFILE OF THE AVERAGE OLDER ADULT IN AMERICA, 80% OF WHOM HAVE AT LEAST ONE CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITION AND 50% OF WHOM HAVE AT LEAST TWO. OBJECTIVES: THIS ARTICLE DISCUSSES THE THERAPEUTIC YOGA FOR SENIORS PROGRAM, OFFERED SINCE 2007 AT DUKE INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE TO FILL A CRITICAL NEED TO HELP YOGA INSTRUCTORS WORK SAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY WITH THE INCREASING NUMBER OF OLDER ADULTS COMING TO YOGA CLASSES, AND EXPLORES THREE AREAS THAT POSE THE GREATEST RISK OF COMPROMISE TO OLDER ADULT STUDENTS: SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, AND OSTEOPOROSIS. TO PROVIDE A SKILLFUL FRAMEWORK FOR TEACHING YOGA TO SENIORS, WE HAVE DEVELOPED SPECIFIC PRINCIPLES OF PRACTICE THAT INTEGRATE THE KNOWLEDGE GAINED FROM WESTERN MEDICINE WITH YOGIC TEACHINGS.	2010

THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE USES OF YOGA AS AN EXPERIENTIAL ADJUNCT TO OTHER FORMS OF THERAPY IN THE TREATMENT OF EATING DISORDERS IN RESIDENTIAL AND OUTPATIENT SETTINGS. SUPPORTED BY OTHER TREATMENT MODALITIES, YOGA CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE METHOD FOR INCREASING SELF-AWARENESS, REFLECTION AND THE ABILITY TO SELF-SOOTHE. LIKE OTHER INTERVENTIONS, YOGA HAS POTENTIAL MISUSES. THESE MISUSES ARE UNCOVERED WITH SUGGESTIONS MADE AS TO HOW THERAPISTS CAN SUPPORT THE PRACTICE OF YOGA IN RESIDENTIAL AND OUTPATIENT SETTINGS.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
13 1914 21 ROLE OF INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY IN A FAILED POST-TOTAL KNEE REPLACEMENT OF BILATERAL KNEES. OA KNEE IS THE MOST COMMON ARTHRITIS. KNEE REPLACEMENT SURGERIES ARE BEING DONE INCREASINGLY IN THE PRESENT TIMES. THIS HAS LED TO THE VIOLATION OF THE STANDARD INDICATIONS AND WHEN KNEES ARE REPLACED IGNORING OTHER CO - MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS IT RESULTS IN THE SURGERY FAILING EARLY. THIS IS ABOUT A PATIENT WHO ENCOUNTERED A FAILED TKR DUE TO IMPROPER SELECTION AS PATIENT HAD BILATERAL OA HIP THAT WAS IGNORED IN THE INITIAL STAGES. TO OVERCOME THE PROBLEM SHE WAS ADVISED BILATERAL HIP REPLACEMENT WHICH WOULD LEAVE HER WITH FOUR REPLACEMENTS IN THE LOWER LIMB. SHE REFUSED SURGERY AND WAS TOLD THERE ARE NO ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS. THIS PATIENT UNDERWENT A 3 WEEK INTEGRATED COURSE OF IAYT AT OUR CENTER AND SHE MADE A REMARKABLE RECOVERY. IAYT IS A GOOD NON-SURGICAL TREATMENT THAT CAN BE AFFECTIVE BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER KNEE REPLACEMENT AND IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS THE FIRST CHOICE OF TREATMENT BEFORE SURGERY.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
14 2600 14 YOGA FOR OSTEOARTHRITIS: NURSING AND RESEARCH CONSIDERATIONS. OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) IS A LEADING CAUSE OF PAIN AND DISABILITY WORLDWIDE. CURRENT TREATMENT GUIDELINES RECOMMEND NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES SUCH AS YOGA FOR FIRSTLINE TREATMENT OF OA. YOGA IS A PROMISING MIND-BODY PRACTICE THAT INCLUDES PHYSICAL POSTURES, BREATHING PRACTICES, AND MEDITATIVE MENTAL FOCUS. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS THE CURRENT EVIDENCE, AS WELL AS A PROPOSED CONCEPTUAL MODEL FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. CURRENT RESEARCH ON YOGA FOR OA IS SCANT BUT PROMISING, SHOWING SOME EVIDENCE OF REDUCED PAIN, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, AND DISABILITY. THE CONCEPTUAL MODEL DESCRIBED HERE PROPOSES MUSCULOSKELETAL EFFECTS (STRENGTHENING, FLEXIBILITY, RELAXATION), REDUCTION OF AUTONOMIC AROUSAL, AND THERAPEUTIC COGNITIVE PATTERNS (DISTRACTION, MINDFULNESS) AS POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT MECHANISMS OF YOGA. THIS ARTICLE ALSO DESCRIBES CONSIDERATIONS FOR PATIENTS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WHEN EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL USEFULNESS AND SAFETY OF YOGA PROGRAMS: YOGA STYLE, INSTRUCTOR QUALIFICATIONS, AND AMOUNT OF TIME SPENT IN YOGA PRACTICE.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
15 2711 18 YOGA KERNELS: A PUBLIC HEALTH MODEL FOR DEVELOPING AND DISSEMINATING EVIDENCE-BASED YOGA PRACTICES. MANY PEOPLE ARE DRAWN TO YOGA FOR ITS POTENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS. WITH ITS RISING POPULARITY, YOGA COULD BECOME A WIDELY USED PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION, BUT ITS SUCCESS DEPENDS ON FINDING EVIDENCE-BASED YOGA PRACTICES THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE AND FEASIBLE FOR A LARGE SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION. COMPLEXITY AND VARIABILITY CREATE BARRIERS TO THE ADOPTION AND MAINTENANCE OF YOGA PRACTICES. IN AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE THE STUDY, ADOPTION, AND MAINTENANCE OF THERAPEUTIC PRACTICES USED IN THE CONTEXT OF PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS, WE INTRODUCE THE CONCEPT OF "YOGA KERNELS," DEFINED AS DISCRETE, EVIDENCE-BASED YOGA PRACTICES THAT ARE AMENABLE TO SCIENTIFIC STUDY AND CAN BE EFFECTIVELY DISSEMINATED AS A PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION. YOGA IS REVIEWED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF A PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION USING THE REACH EFFECTIVENESS ADOPTION IMPLEMENTATION AND MAINTENANCE (RE-AIM) MODEL. THIS MODEL IS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE SUCCESSFUL ADOPTION AND MAINTENANCE OF GENERALIZABLE, EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS. IN RESPONSE TO THE CHALLENGES TO THE ADOPTION AND MAINTENANCE OF YOGA PRACTICES, WE PROPOSE THAT A POTENTIALLY FRUITFUL DIRECTION FOR YOGA RESEARCH IS MOVING AWAY FROM STUDYING YOGA CLASSES TO STUDYING SPECIFIC YOGA PRACTICES THAT ARE SIMPLER AND EASIER FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO USE. YOGA KERNELS COULD BE A UNIFYING CONCEPT TO IDENTIFY THERAPEUTIC USES OF YOGA AND HELP PEOPLE ADOPT AND MAINTAIN THESE PRACTICES AS PART OF A SYSTEMATIC PUBLIC HEALTH STRATEGY.	2019	
                                                                                                                                          
16 1937 14 ROLE OF YOGA IN THE TREATMENT OF NEUROTIC DISORDERS: CURRENT STATUS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS. A LARGE NUMBER OF STUDIES HAVE CONSISTENTLY DEMONSTRATED THE POTENTIAL OF YOGA, NOT ONLY IN THE TREATMENT OF PSYCHIATRIC AND PSYCHOSOMATIC DISORDER BUT ALSO IN PROMOTING POSITIVE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. THIS PAPER REVIEWS VARIOUS STUDIES ON THE TREATMENT OF NEUROSIS WITH TECHNIQUES DERIVED FROM YOGA. A FEW LACUNAE HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AND POSSIBLE DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH ARE OUTLINED. IT IS HOPED THAT RESEARCH ALONG THESE LINES WILL DEVELOP A STANDARDIZED METHOD OF YOGA THERAPY WHICH CAN BE UTILIZED AND INTEGRATED WITHIN THE EXISTING METHODS OF TREATMENT OF NEUROTIC DISORDERS.	1994

HOWEVER, THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL SHORTCOMINGS IN THE PRACTICE, POLICY, AND RESEARCH OF YOGA THAT UNDERMINE ITS OPTIMAL USE. YOGA AS A MODALITY FUNCTIONS WITHIN A CONTEXT. THEREFORE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO OCCASIONALLY STEP BACK AND EXAMINE THE ENTIRETY OF THE CONTEXT FROM A HIGH VANTAGE TO ASSESS WHETHER THE TACTICAL AND PROGRAMMATIC ENDEAVORS ARE ALIGNED WITH THE STRATEGIC INTENDED PURPOSE. THIS COMMENTARY DISCUSSES A FEW POLICY ISSUES RELEVANT TO SOME KEY STAKEHOLDERS. IT SUGGESTS THAT YOGA THERAPISTS NEED TO CALIBRATE THEIR MODEL OF YOGA BY REDUCING EMPHASIS ON POSTURES AND INCREASING IT ON MEDITATION AND BREATHING EXERCISES WHILE CATERING TO CLIENTS WITH CHRONIC CONDITIONS. IT RECOMMENDS THAT YOGA RESEARCH SHOULD BE MORE CRITICAL IN EVALUATING YOGA'S FUNDAMENTAL TENETS AND USE REDUCTIONIST APPROACH TO DO SO. IT PROPOSES THAT AUTONOMOUS REGULATORS SHOULD EXTRICATE INJURY PRONE POSTURES FROM THE BODY OF YOGA PRACTICE FOR REGULATORY PURPOSES, RATHER THAN REGULATE YOGA SUMMARILY. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT PAYERS SHOULD PAY FOR YOGA. HOWEVER, THEY SHOULD USE PAYMENT MODEL AS IT IS USED FOR VACCINATION, INSTEAD OF PAYING AS IT IS DONE FOR PHYSIOTHERAPY. IT CONCLUDES THAT YOGA CAN HELP, BUT BEFORE IT CAN HELP IT NEEDS HELP ITSELF, AND THE VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS NEED TO REFLECT ON THE BIG PICTURE SO THAT THEY CAN COLLABORATE ON THESE IMPROVEMENTS.	2017	
                        
18 2580 20 YOGA FOR HEALTHY AGING: SCIENCE OR HYPE? YOGA, ONE OF THE WORLD'S OLDEST HEALTH SYSTEMS IS RECEIVING NEW ATTENTION FOR CLAIMS THAT IT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO HEALTHY AGING. UNTIL RECENTLY, SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE FOR ITS EFFICACY HAS RELIED HEAVILY ON SMALL AND POORLY-DESIGNED RESEARCH, BUT THIS IS CHANGING. MULTIPLE, WELL-DESIGNED STUDIES PROVIDE DATA SHOWING THAT YOGA PRACTICE HAS POSITIVE EFFECTS ON CELLULAR AGING, MOBILITY, BALANCE, MENTAL HEALTH, AND PREVENTION OF COGNITIVE DECLINE-ALL AREAS OF CONCERN FOR OLDER ADULTS. SINCE THE COST OF IMPLEMENTING YOGA-BASED COMMUNITY AND HOME-BASED INTERVENTIONS IS LOW-POLICYMAKERS ARE ALSO EYEING YOGA PRACTICE AS A COST-EFFECTIVE WAY TO REDUCE MEDICAL COSTS AND IMPROVE OUTCOMES AMONG A GROWING AGING POPULATION. THIS COMMENTARY REVIEWS THE EVIDENCE FOR BOTH PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS FROM YOGA, AS WELL AS CONCERNS ABOUT INJURIES THAT HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN TYPES OF YOGA PRACTICE. IT REVEALS A SURPRISING RANGE OF YOGA PROGRAMS AND DIFFICULTY LEVELS THAT PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALMOST ANYONE TO PARTICIPATE AND GAIN HEALTH BENEFITS WITH PRACTICE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
19 2375 16 WHITE PAPER: YOGA THERAPY AND PAIN-HOW YOGA THERAPY SERVES IN COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT, AND HOW IT CAN DO MORE. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE ROLE OF YOGA THERAPY IN COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATIVE PAIN MANAGEMENT (CIPM). THE PAIN CRISIS IS DESCRIBED, AND HOW YOGA THERAPISTS CAN CONTRIBUTE TO ITS SOLUTION IS EXPLAINED. YOGA THERAPY CAN BE AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF THE MULTIDISCIPLINARY UNDERTAKING THAT WILL BE REQUIRED TO IMPROVE PATIENT OUTCOMES AND ALTER THE TRAJECTORY OF THE GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS CONSTITUTED BY AN EPIDEMIC OF POORLY UNDERSTOOD AND INADEQUATELY ADDRESSED PAIN. ADDITIONAL CONTEXT AND EVIDENCE ARE PRESENTED TO DOCUMENT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTIONS TO SUPPORT PEOPLE LIVING WITH PAIN. THE WHITE PAPER CONCLUDES BY LISTING RECOMMENDATIONS TO PROVIDERS, CONSUMERS, PAYERS, AND LEGISLATORS, WHO TOGETHER CAN ADDRESS SYSTEMIC AND STRUCTURAL BARRIERS TO CIPM, AS WELL AS SUGGESTIONS FOR ENABLING THE YOGA THERAPY PROFESSION TO MORE FULLY PARTICIPATE IN THESE SOLUTIONS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
20 2630 18 YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION: FIVE QUESTIONS TO MOVE THE EVIDENCE-BASE FORWARD. YOGA-BASED PRACTICES, DERIVED FROM ANCIENT EASTERN MIND-BODY PRACTICES, HAVE GROWN IN POPULARITY IN THE WEST OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES. INCREASING EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFECTS OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS (YBIS). HOWEVER, DESPITE YOGA'S PROMISE AS A POTENTIAL TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION, THE LITERATURE TO DATE IS MARKED BY SUBSTANTIAL METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS, WHICH REMAIN A BARRIER TO THE INTEGRATION OF YBIS INTO CONVENTIONAL CLINICAL CARE. WE HIGHLIGHT FIVE KEY AREAS OF STUDY THAT NEED FURTHER INVESTIGATION TO FILL CRUCIAL GAPS IN THE LITERATURE-BASE TO ADVANCE YOGA RESEARCH AND YOGA'S POTENTIAL AS AN EFFECTIVE EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION.	2019

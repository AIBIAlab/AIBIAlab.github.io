1 1232 150 FEASIBILITY AND POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF PARTNER-SUPPORTED YOGA ON PSYCHOSOCIAL AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION AMONG LUNG CANCER PATIENTS. OBJECTIVE: PATIENTS WITH LUNG CANCER EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN PSYCHOSOCIAL AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION DURING AND AFTER TREATMENT THAT IMPACT QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AND SURVIVAL. YOGA IS A POTENTIAL STRATEGY TO MITIGATE FUNCTIONAL DECLINE AMONG PATIENTS WITH LUNG CANCER. METHODS: A SINGLE GROUP 12-WEEK PILOT TRIAL OF LOW-MODERATE INTENSITY YOGA AMONG PATIENTS WITH STAGE I-IV LUNG CANCER AND THEIR PARTNERS (N = 46; 23 PATIENT-PARTNER DYADS) DURING CANCER TREATMENT FROM TWO HOSPITAL SYSTEMS. FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY, DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS, AND COHEN D EFFECT SIZES WERE CALCULATED AT 6 AND 12-WEEKS FOR PSYCHOSOCIAL AND PHYSICAL OUTCOMES USING VALIDATED QUESTIONNAIRES AND ASSESSMENTS. RESULTS: AT 6 AND 12-WEEKS, RETENTION WAS 65% AND WITHDRAWALS WERE MAINLY DUE TO DISEASE PROGRESSION. AMONG STUDY COMPLETERS (N = 26; 13 DYADS) ADHERENCE WAS 80%. COMPARING BASELINE TO 12-WEEK MEASUREMENTS, FATIGUE, DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS, AND SLEEP DISTURBANCE IMPROVED IN 54% OF PARTICIPANTS FOR ALL THREE MEASURES (COHEN'S D = 0.40-0.53). QOL IMPROVED IN 77% OF PARTICIPANTS (COHEN'S D = 0.34). UPPER AND LOWER BODY FLEXIBILITY, AND LOWER BODY STRENGTH IMPROVED IN 92%, 85% AND 77% OF PARTICIPANTS, RESPECTIVELY (COHEN'S D = 0.39-1.08). SIX-MINUTE WALK TEST IMPROVED IN 62% OF PARTICIPANTS AN AVERAGE OF 32 METERS (SD = 11.3; COHEN'S D = 0.17). NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS: AMONG PATIENTS WITH STAGE I-IV LUNG CANCER INCLUDING ACTIVE TREATMENT, A 12-WEEK PARTNER-SUPPORTED YOGA PROGRAM IS FEASIBLE, ACCEPTABLE, AND IMPROVED PSYCHOSOCIAL AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION. LOW-INTENSITY YOGA MAY BE A COMPLIMENTARY APPROACH TO REDUCE THE EFFECTS OF CANCER TREATMENT, HOWEVER, MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF PARTNER-SUPPORTED YOGA TO MITIGATE FUNCTIONAL DECLINE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
2 1242  44 FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA INTERVENTION TO DECREASE PAIN IN OLDER WOMEN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF OLDER WOMEN SUFFER FROM CHRONIC PAIN, WHICH CAN DECREASE QUALITY OF LIFE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PILOT RANDOMIZED STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF A FLOW-RESTORATIVE YOGA INTERVENTION DESIGNED TO DECREASE PAIN AND RELATED OUTCOMES AMONG WOMEN AGED 60 OR OLDER. METHODS: FLOW-RESTORATIVE YOGA CLASSES WERE HELD TWICE WEEKLY FOR 1 HOUR AND LED BY A CERTIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTOR. PARTICIPANTS RANDOMIZED TO THE INTERVENTION GROUP ATTENDED THE YOGA CLASSES FOR 12 WEEKS AND RECEIVED SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS FOR AT-HOME PRACTICE. THOSE RANDOMIZED TO THE CONTROL GROUP WERE ASKED TO MAINTAIN THEIR NORMAL DAILY ROUTINE. FEASIBILITY WAS EVALUATED USING RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION RATES, CLASS AND HOME PRACTICE ADHERENCE RATES, AND PARTICIPANT SATISFACTION SURVEYS. OUTCOME MEASURES (SELF-REPORTED PAIN, INFLAMMATORY MARKERS, FUNCTIONAL FITNESS, QUALITY OF LIFE, RESILIENCE, AND SELF-REPORTED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY) WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION. PAIRED T-TESTS OR WILCOXON SIGNED-RANK TESTS WERE USED TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN OUTCOME MEASURES WITHIN TREATMENT GROUPS. RESULTS: THIRTY-EIGHT PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED. PARTICIPANTS WERE PRIMARILY WHITE, COLLEGE-EDUCATED, AND HIGHER FUNCTIONING, DESPITE EXPERIENCING VARIOUS FORMS OF CHRONIC PAIN. ATTENDANCE AND RETENTION RATES WERE HIGH (91 AND 97%, RESPECTIVELY) AND THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS WERE SATISFIED WITH THE YOGA PROGRAM (89%) AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS (87%). INTERVENTION PARTICIPANTS ALSO EXPERIENCED REDUCTIONS IN PAIN INTERFERENCE AND IMPROVEMENTS IN ENERGY AND SOCIAL FUNCTIONING. CONCLUSIONS: THIS PILOT STUDY PROVIDES ESSENTIAL DATA TO INFORM A FULL SCALE RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF FLOW-RESTORATIVE YOGA FOR OLDER WOMEN WITH CHRONIC PAIN. FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD EMPHASIZE STRATEGIES TO RECRUIT A MORE DIVERSE STUDY POPULATION, PARTICULARLY OLDER WOMEN AT HIGHER RISK OF DISABILITY AND FUNCTIONAL DECLINE.

3 2579  38 YOGA FOR HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN ADULT CANCER: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED FEASIBILITY STUDY. AN INCREASE IN PATIENT-LED UPTAKE OF COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN ADULT CANCER HAS LED TO A NEED FOR MORE RIGOROUS STUDY OF SUCH INTERVENTIONS AND THEIR OUTCOMES. THIS STUDY THEREFORE AIMED TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF A YOGA INTERVENTION IN MEN AND WOMEN RECEIVING CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT FOR A CANCER DIAGNOSIS. PROSPECTIVE, MIXED METHODS FEASIBILITY TRIAL ALLOCATED PARTICIPANTS TO RECEIVE ONE OF THREE YOGA INTERVENTIONS OVER A FOUR-WEEK STUDY PERIOD. DATA COLLECTION WAS COMPLETED THROUGH ONLINE SURVEY OF QOL-CA/CS AND CUSTOMIZED SURVEYS. FIFTEEN PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED (11 FEMALE) UNDERGOING TREATMENT FOR BREAST, PROSTATE, COLORECTAL, BRAIN, AND BLOOD AND LUNG CANCER. TWO PARTICIPANTS DROPPED OUT AND COMPLETE QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DATA SETS WERE COLLECTED FROM 12 PARTICIPANTS AND FOUR YOGA INSTRUCTORS. OTHER OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED IMPLEMENTATION COSTS PATIENT-REPORTED PREFERENCES FOR YOGA INTERVENTION AND CHANGES IN QOL-CA/CS. THREE TYPES OF YOGA INTERVENTION WERE SAFELY ADMINISTERED IN ADULT CANCER. MIXED METHODS, COST-EFFICIENCY, QOL-CA/CS, AND EVIDENCE-BASED DESIGN OF YOGA INTERVENTION HAVE BEEN USED TO ESTABLISH FEASIBILITY AND PATIENT-PREFERENCES FOR YOGA DELIVERY IN ADULT CANER. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT, WITH SOME METHODOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS, A LARGE-SCALE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IS WARRANTED TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR MALE AND FEMALE CANCER PATIENTS.

4 2187  46 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH: A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: UNIVERSITIES AROUND THE WORLD ARE FACING AN EPIDEMIC OF MENTAL DISTRESS AMONG THEIR STUDENTS. THE PROBLEM IS TRULY A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE, AFFECTING MANY AND WITH SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES. THE GLOBAL BURDEN OF DISEASE-AGENDA CALLS FOR EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS WITH LASTING EFFECTS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE MENTAL HEALTH OF YOUNG ADULTS. IN THIS STUDY WE AIMED TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOGA, A POPULAR AND WIDELY AVAILABLE MIND-BODY PRACTICE, CAN IMPROVE STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH. METHODS: WE PERFORMED A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH 202 HEALTHY UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN THE OSLO AREA. THE PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSIGNED TO A YOGA GROUP OR WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP IN A 1:1 RATIO BY A SIMPLE ONLINE RANDOMISATION PROGRAM. THE INTERVENTION GROUP WAS OFFERED 24 YOGA SESSIONS OVER 12 WEEKS. MEASUREMENTS WERE TAKEN AT WEEK 0 (BASELINE), WEEK 12 (POST-INTERVENTION), AND WEEK 24 (FOLLOW-UP). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS ASSESSED BY THE HSCL-25 QUESTIONNAIRE. ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED BASED ON THE INTENTION TO TREAT-PRINCIPLE. RESULTS: BETWEEN 24 JANUARY 2017, AND 27 AUGUST 2017, WE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED 202 STUDENTS TO A YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 100), OR WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 102). COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP, THE YOGA PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DISTRESS SYMPTOMS BOTH AT POST-INTERVENTION (ADJUSTED DIFFERENCE IN THE MEAN CHANGE -0.15, 95% CI -0.26 TO -0.03, P = 0.0110) AND FOLLOW-UP (ADJUSTED DIFFERENCE IN THE MEAN CHANGE -0.18, 95% CI -0.29 TO -0.06, P = 0.0025). SLEEP QUALITY ALSO IMPROVED AT POST-INTERVENTION AND FOLLOW-UP. NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS: OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA HAS A MODERATELY LARGE AND LASTING EFFECT, AT LEAST FOR SOME MONTHS, REDUCING SYMPTOMS OF DISTRESS AND IMPROVING SLEEP QUALITY AMONG STUDENTS. FURTHER RESEARCH SHOULD SEEK WAYS TO ENHANCE THE EFFECT, ASSESS AN EVEN LONGER FOLLOW-UP PERIOD, INCLUDE ACTIVE CONTROL GROUPS, AND CONSIDER PERFORMING SIMILAR STUDIES IN OTHER CULTURAL SETTINGS.TRIAL REGISTRATION: CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT04258540.	2020

BACKGROUND: AND PURPOSE: YOGA IS GROWING IN POPULARITY, BUT ITS BENEFITS AND INTEGRATION INTO PRIMARY CARE REMAIN UNCERTAIN. HERE, WE DETERMINE YOGA EFFECTS ON QUALITY OF LIFE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, AND EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF INTRODUCING YOGA AT PRIMARY CARE LEVEL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS IS A PROSPECTIVE, LONGITUDINAL, QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY, WITH AN INTERVENTION (N=49) AND A CONTROL GROUP (N=37). YOGA GROUP UNDERWENT 24-WEEKS PROGRAM OF ONE-HOUR SESSIONS. OUR PRIMARY ENDPOINT WAS QUALITY OF LIFE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, AS WELL AS SATISFACTION LEVEL AND ADHERENCE RATE. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS REPORTED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ALL DOMAINS OF QUALITY OF LIFE AND A REDUCTION OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES PSYCHOLOGICAL QUALITY OF LIFE (P=0.046). CONCLUSION: YOGA IN PRIMARY CARE IS FEASIBLE, SAFE AND HAS A SATISFACTORY ADHERENCE, AS WELL AS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON PSYCHOLOGICAL QUALITY OF LIFE OF PARTICIPANTS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
6 1564  61 LONGITUDINAL IMPACT OF YOGA ON CHEMOTHERAPY-RELATED COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN WOMEN WITH EARLY STAGE BREAST CANCER: A CASE SERIES. PURPOSE: ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER HAS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED THE CURE RATE; HOWEVER, IT HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH CHEMOTHERAPY-RELATED COGNITIVE IMPACT (CRCI). THE LITERATURE PROVIDES PRELIMINARY SUPPORT FOR THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFICACY OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR THE GENERAL CANCER POPULATION, HOWEVER, CONTROLLED TRIALS ARE SCARCE AND NO STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON COGNITION FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER DURING CHEMOTHERAPY. THIS CASE SERIES AIMS TO IDENTIFY THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON MEASURES OF COGNITION, FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES, AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) FOR BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS (BCS). METHODS: FOUR WOMEN WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF EARLY-STAGE BREAST CANCER PRIOR TO CHEMOTHERAPY TREATMENT WERE ADMINISTERED THE FOLLOWING PHYSIOLOGIC MEASURES AT BASELINE, 6, AND 12 WEEKS DURING CHEMOTHERAPY, AND AT ONE AND THREE MONTHS AFTER THE CONCLUSION OF THE STUDY: FUNCTIONAL REACH TEST (BALANCE) AND SIT AND REACH TEST (FLEXIBILITY), AND QOL, POMS (MOOD) AND FACT-B (QOL), AT BASELINE. PRIMARY OUTCOMES OF COGNITION WERE MEASURED WITH THE PERCEIVED COGNITION QUESTIONNAIRE (PCQ) AND COGSTATE, A COMPUTERIZED MEASUREMENT OF COGNITION. WOMEN ATTENDED AN IYENGAR-INSPIRED YOGA PROGRAM TWICE A WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS. QUALITATIVE QUESTIONNAIRES WERE ADMINISTERED AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE STUDY TO DETERMINE PERCEIVED BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES OF THE YOGA PROGRAM. RESULTS: FOUR WOMEN WITH STAGE II BREAST CANCER RANGED IN AGE FROM 44-65 YEARS. COGSTATE COMPUTERIZED TESTING SHOWED CHANGES IN VARYING DOMAINS OF COGNITION THROUGH TREATMENT AND FOLLOW-UP. IMPROVED BALANCE, FLEXIBILITY, AND QOL WERE ALSO NOTED OVER TIME. NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE OBSERVED. ANALYSIS OF QUALITATIVE DATA REVEALED THE YOGA CLASSES WERE HELPFUL AND SUBJECTS CONTINUED THE PRACTICE ELEMENTS OF YOGA INCLUDING RELAXATION, BREATHING, AND STRETCHING. THE MOST CHALLENGING ASPECT OF THE STUDY WAS PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS DUE TO VARIOUS MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS AND INCLUDED FATIGUE, DECREASED RANGE OF MOTION, AND PAIN. CONCLUSION: THIS CASE SERIES SUGGESTS THAT YOGA MAY IMPACT VARIOUS ASPECTS OF COGNITION DURING AND AFTER CHEMOTHERAPY ADMINISTRATION AS NOTED THROUGH QUANTITATIVE MEASURES. WOMEN DESCRIBE YOGA AS IMPROVING VARIOUS DOMAINS OF QOL THROUGH THE TREATMENT TRAJECTORY. THIS MIND-BODY INTERVENTION MAY STAVE OFF CRCI; HOWEVER, FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS NEEDED FOR ADDITIONAL RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON COGNITION FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER UNDERGOING ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY TREATMENT.	2012	

7 2207  46 THE FEASIBILITY AND BENEFITS OF A 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION FOR PEDIATRIC CANCER OUT-PATIENTS. BACKGROUND: INCREASING RATES OF SURVIVAL PRESENT A NEW SET OF PSYCHOSOCIAL AND PHYSICAL CHALLENGES FOR CHILDREN UNDERGOING TREATMENT FOR CANCER. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (PA) HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE STRATEGY TO MITIGATE THE SIGNIFICANT BURDEN OF CANCER AND ITS TREATMENTS, WITH YOGA INCREASINGLY GAINING RECOGNITION AS A GENTLE ALTERNATIVE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND BENEFITS OF A 12-WEEK COMMUNITY-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQL), SELECT PHYSICAL FITNESS OUTCOMES AND PA LEVELS (PAL). PROCEDURE: EIGHT PEDIATRIC CANCER OUT-PATIENTS (4 MALE; 4 FEMALE; MAGE = 11.88, SD = 4.26) PARTICIPATED IN THE 12-WEEK INTERVENTION CONSISTING OF SUPERVISED YOGA SESSIONS 2 TIMES/WEEK. PARTICIPANTS (PATIENTS AND PARENT PROXIES) COMPLETED MEASURES ASSESSING HRQL, PHYSICAL FITNESS AND PAL AT BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION. RESULTS: RATES OF RECRUITMENT, RETENTION, ATTENDANCE AND ADVERSE EVENTS INDICATED THE PROGRAM WAS FEASIBLE. WILCOXON SIGNED RANK TESTS INDICATED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS FOR PATIENT (P = 0.02) AND PARENT REPORTED HRQL (P = 0.03), FUNCTIONAL MOBILITY (P = 0.01), HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY (LEFT, P = 0.01 AND RIGHT P = 0.02), AND TOTAL PAL (P = 0.02) PRE TO POST INTERVENTION. CONCLUSION: THIS 12-WEEK COMMUNITY-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION WAS FEASIBLE AND PROVIDES PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE FOR THE BENEFITS OF YOGA ON HRQL, PHYSICAL FITNESS AND PAL IN PEDIATRIC CANCER OUT-PATIENTS.

8 1233  45 FEASIBILITY AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF TAILORED YOGA IN SURVIVORS OF HEAD AND NECK CANCER: A PILOT STUDY. PURPOSE: TREATMENT FOR HEAD AND NECK CANCER (HNC) RESULTS IN LONG-TERM TOXICITIES AND INCREASED PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL SURVIVOR BURDEN. THERE ARE A LIMITED NUMBER OF TREATMENTS FOR THESE LATE EFFECTS. YOGA POSTURES, BREATH WORK, RELAXATION, AND MEDITATION, MAY IMPROVE THESE LATE EFFECTS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF A TAILORED YOGA PROGRAM IN HNC SURVIVORS AND OBTAIN PRELIMINARY EFFICACY DATA. METHODS: THIS WAS A RANDOMIZED WAIT-LIST CONTROL STUDY OF YOGA-NAIVE HNC SURVIVORS WHO WERE >3 MONTHS POST-CANCER TREATMENT. BASELINE DATA WERE COLLECTED. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER AN 8-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP OR A WAIT-LIST GROUP. FEASIBILITY AND EFFICACY DATA WERE COLLECTED. AT 4 AND 8 WEEKS, PATIENTS UNDERWENT A REPEAT ASSESSMENT OF HEALTH. WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP PARTICIPANTS WERE OFFERED THE YOGA PROGRAM AFTER DATA COLLECTION. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS EVALUATED FEASIBILITY. MIXED EFFECTS GENERAL LINEAR MODELS WERE USED TO GENERATE ESTIMATES OF THE EFFICACY OUTCOMES. RESULTS: SEVENTY-THREE INDIVIDUALS WERE SCREENED AND 40 WERE ELIGIBLE. ALL ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS CONSENTED AND ENROLLED. FIVE OF THE INTERVENTION GROUP DISCONTINUED EARLY AND NONE IN THE WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP. FEASIBILITY WAS AFFIRMED AS PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED AND RETAINED IN THE STUDY, THERE WERE NO ADVERSE EVENTS, FIDELITY TO PROTOCOL WAS DEMONSTRATED, AND SATISFACTION RATES WERE HIGH. EFFICACY MEASURES INDICATED POTENTIAL BENEFIT FOR SHOULDER RANGE OF MOTION ( D = 0.57-0.86, P < .05), PAIN ( D = 0.67-0.90, P </= .005), AND ANXIETY ( D = 0.59, P = .015). CONCLUSION: A TAILORED HATHA YOGA PROGRAM IS FEASIBLE AND POTENTIALLY EFFICACIOUS FOR HNC SURVIVORS. PRELIMINARY DATA SUPPORTS FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF YOGA IN THIS POPULATION IS NEEDED.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
9 2096  44 THE EFFECT OF YOGA EXERCISE ON IMPROVING DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND FATIGUE IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND FATIGUE ARE AMONG THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS THAT INFLUENCE THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER WHO RECEIVE ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY. ALTHOUGH EVIDENCE HAS SHOWN YOGA TO DECREASE ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER, FEW STUDIES ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA HAVE TARGETED PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. YOGA INTERVENTIONS SHOULD BE TESTED TO PROMOTE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH OF WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER. PURPOSE: THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AN 8-WEEK YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM IN PROMOTING THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH OF WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER UNDERGOING ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY IN TERMS OF DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND FATIGUE. METHODS: A SAMPLE OF 60 WOMEN WITH NONMETASTATIC BREAST CANCER WAS RECRUITED. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED INTO EITHER THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (N = 30) OR THE CONTROL GROUP (N = 30). A 60-MINUTE, TWICE-PER-WEEK YOGA EXERCISE WAS IMPLEMENTED FOR 8 WEEKS AS THE INTERVENTION FOR THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP. THE CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED STANDARD CARE ONLY. RESULTS: ANALYSIS USING THE JOHNSON-NEYMAN PROCEDURE FOUND THAT THE YOGA EXERCISE REDUCED OVERALL FATIGUE AND THE INTERFERENCE OF FATIGUE IN EVERYDAY LIFE FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PARTICIPANTS. SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS WERE OBTAINED AFTER 4 WEEKS OF INTERVENTION PARTICIPATION FOR THOSE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PATIENTS WITH RELATIVELY LOW STARTING BASELINE VALUES (BASELINE ITEM MEAN VALUE < 3.31 AND 3.22, RESPECTIVELY) AND AFTER 8 WEEKS FOR MOST PATIENTS (APPROXIMATELY 75%) WITH MODERATE STARTING BASELINE VALUES (BASELINE ITEM MEAN VALUE < 7.30 AND 5.34, RESPECTIVELY). THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE LEVELS OF DEPRESSION (F = 1.29, P > .05) OR ANXIETY (F = 2.7, P > .05). CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: THE 8-WEEK YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM DEVELOPED IN THIS STUDY EFFECTIVELY REDUCED FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER BUT DID NOT REDUCE DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY. ONCOLOGY NURSES SHOULD STRENGTHEN THEIR CLINICAL HEALTH EDUCATION AND APPLY YOGA TO REDUCE THE FATIGUE EXPERIENCED BY PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER WHO UNDERGO ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
10  206  36 A SELF-DIRECTED HOME YOGA PROGRAMME FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER DURING CHEMOTHERAPY: A FEASIBILITY STUDY. RECENT STUDIES SUGGEST YOGA AS A PROMISING APPROACH FOR IMPROVING THE COGNITIVE FUNCTION OF CANCER SURVIVORS. WE STUDIED WHETHER A SELF-DIRECTED HOME YOGA PROGRAMME WAS FEASIBLE FOR PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER WHO WERE UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY. PARTICIPANTS' PREFERENCES FOR THE TYPE OF YOGA COURSE AND THE CLINICAL EFFECTS OF THE PROGRAMME WERE ALSO ASSESSED. IN THIS STUDY, 18 WOMEN (MEAN AGE, 43.9 YEARS) WERE ENROLLED (44.7% RECRUITMENT RATE). OF THE PARTICIPANTS, 63.6% HAD STAGE II CANCER AND 71.4% RECEIVED ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY. FAVOURABLE RETENTION (86%), ADHERENCE (94.4%) AND ACCEPTABILITY (96.5%) RATES WERE DETERMINED. MOST (94.4%) OF THE WOMEN PRACTICED THE HOME PROGRAMME MORE THAN TWICE A WEEK ON AVERAGE. THE PARTICIPANTS PREFERRED TO GRADUALLY INCREASE THE INTENSITY OF THE EXERCISES. WE ONLY OBSERVED IMPROVEMENTS IN THE COGNITIVE ASPECTS OF FATIGUE. NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS WERE ENCOUNTERED DURING THE PROGRAMME. THIS SELF-DIRECTED HOME YOGA PROGRAMME WAS SAFE AND FEASIBLE FOR PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
11 1106  41 EFFECTS OF YOGA, AEROBIC, AND STRETCHING AND TONING EXERCISES ON COGNITION IN ADULT CANCER SURVIVORS: PROTOCOL OF THE STAY FIT PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: CANCER SURVIVORS EXPERIENCE COMPROMISED QUALITY OF LIFE DUE TO IMPAIRED COGNITIVE FUNCTION AS A RESULT OF CANCER DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT. ALTHOUGH EXERCISE HAS PROVEN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING COGNITIVE FUNCTION ACROSS THE LIFESPAN, INTERVENTIONS COMPREHENSIVELY TESTING THE EFFECTIVENESS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS ARE LIMITED. THE STAY FIT TRIAL IS A THREE-ARMED PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL DESIGNED TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF A 12-WEEK YOGA, AEROBIC WALKING, AND STRETCH AND TONE INTERVENTION ON COGNITIVE FUNCTION AMONG ADULT CANCER SURVIVORS. METHODS: THIS PILOT STUDY AIMS TO RECRUIT 75 ADULT CANCER SURVIVORS WHO WILL COMPLETE ASSESSMENTS OF COGNITIVE FUNCTION, CARDIOVASCULAR FITNESS, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL MEASURES AT BASELINE AND AFTER THE 12-WEEK INTERVENTION. THE AIMS OF STAY FIT ARE (1) TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF YOGA TO IMPROVE COGNITIVE FUNCTION AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS, COMPARED TO AEROBIC EXERCISE AND AN ACTIVE CONTROL GROUP; (2) TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN CARDIOVASCULAR FITNESS AS A RESULT OF THE INTERVENTIONS; AND (3) TO ASSESS CHANGES IN QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG OUR POPULATION AS A RESULT OF THE EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS. DISCUSSION: THE STAY FIT TRIAL WILL TEST THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA, AEROBIC EXERCISE, AND STRETCHING AND TONING EXERCISES IN IMPROVING COGNITIVE FUNCTION AND FITNESS AMONG ADULT CANCER SURVIVORS. THE RESULTS OF THIS PILOT STUDY WILL ENABLE US TO UNDERSTAND THE MOST EFFECTIVE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY MODALITY TO IMPROVE COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN THIS POPULATION AND POTENTIALLY COMBAT CANCER-RELATED COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT.

12  428  42 CAN YOGA HAVE ANY EFFECT ON SHOULDER AND ARM PAIN AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER? A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED, SINGLE-BLIND TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SHOULDER AND ARM PAIN, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), DEPRESSION, AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. METHODS: THIS PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED STUDY INCLUDED 42 PATIENTS. THE PATIENTS IN GROUP 1 UNDERWENT A 10-WEEK HATHA YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM. THE PATIENTS IN GROUP 2 WERE INCLUDED IN A 10-WEEK FOLLOW-UP PROGRAM. OUR PRIMARY ENDPOINT WAS ARM AND SHOULDER PAIN INTENSITY. RESULTS: THE GROUP RECEIVING YOGA SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR PAIN SEVERITY FROM BASELINE TO POST-TREATMENT, AND THESE BENEFITS WERE MAINTAINED AT 2.5 MONTHS POST-TREATMENT. WHEN COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP, THERE WERE NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 2 GROUPS WITH RESPECT TO THE PARAMETERS ASSESSED AT THE END OF WEEK 10. CONCLUSION: YOGA WAS AN EFFECTIVE AND SAFE EXERCISE FOR ALLEVIATING SHOULDER AND ARM PAIN, WHICH IS A COMPLICATION WITH A HIGH PREVALENCE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
13 2605  45 YOGA FOR PERSISTENT FATIGUE IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS: RESULTS OF A PILOT STUDY. APPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS EXPERIENCES PERSISTENT FATIGUE FOR MONTHS OR YEARS AFTER SUCCESSFUL TREATMENT COMPLETION. THERE IS A LACK OF EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENTS FOR CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, PARTICULARLY AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS. THIS SINGLE-ARM PILOT STUDY EVALUATED THE FEASIBILITY AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR FATIGUED BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS BASED ON THE IYENGAR TRADITION. IYENGAR YOGA PRESCRIBES SPECIFIC POSES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH SPECIFIC MEDICAL PROBLEMS AND CONDITIONS; THIS TRIAL EMPHASIZED POSTURES BELIEVED TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR REDUCING FATIGUE AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS, INCLUDING INVERSIONS AND BACKBENDS PERFORMED WITH THE SUPPORT OF PROPS. TWELVE WOMEN WERE ENROLLED IN THE TRIAL, AND 11 COMPLETED THE FULL 12-WEEK COURSE OF TREATMENT. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN FATIGUE SCORES FROM PRE- TO POST-INTERVENTION THAT WAS MAINTAINED AT THE 3-MONTH POST-INTERVENTION FOLLOWUP. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE ALSO OBSERVED IN MEASURES OF PHYSICAL FUNCTION, DEPRESSED MOOD, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. THESE RESULTS SUPPORT THE ACCEPTABILITY OF THIS INTERVENTION AND SUGGEST THAT IT MAY HAVE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON PERSISTENT POST-TREATMENT FATIGUE. HOWEVER, RESULTS REQUIRE REPLICATION IN A LARGER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
14 1228  38 FEASIBILITY AND IMPACT OF A YOGA INTERVENTION ON COGNITION, PHYSICAL FUNCTION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND AFFECTIVE OUTCOMES AMONG PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT TRIAL. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IS TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY AND IMPACT OF A TRIWEEKLY 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION AMONG PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV (PLWH). ADDITIONAL OBJECTIVES INCLUDED EVALUATING COGNITION, PHYSICAL FUNCTION, MEDICATION ADHERENCE, HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL), AND MENTAL HEALTH AMONG YOGA PARTICIPANTS VERSUS CONTROLS USING BLINDED ASSESSORS. WE RECRUITED 22 MEDICALLY STABLE PLWH AGED >/=35 YEARS. A PRIORI FEASIBILITY CRITERIA WERE >/=70% YOGA SESSION ATTENDANCE AND >/=70% OF PARTICIPANTS SATISFIED WITH THE INTERVENTION USING A POSTPARTICIPATION QUESTIONNAIRE. TWO PARTICIPANTS WITHDREW FROM THE YOGA GROUP. MEAN YOGA CLASS ATTENDANCE WAS 82%, WITH 100% SATISFACTION. INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSES (YOGA N = 11, CONTROL N = 11) SHOWED NO WITHIN- OR BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCES IN COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION. THE YOGA GROUP IMPROVED OVER TIME IN HRQOL COGNITION (P = .047) WITH TRENDS TOWARD IMPROVEMENTS IN HRQOL HEALTH TRANSITION (P =.063) AND DEPRESSION (P = .055). THIS PILOT STUDY PROVIDES PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE OF FEASIBILITY AND BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR PLWH.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
15 1249  52 FEASIBILITY STUDY OF A MODIFIED YOGA PROGRAM FOR CHRONIC PAIN AMONG ELDERLY ADULTS IN ASSISTED AND INDEPENDENT LIVING. CONTEXT: YOGA IMPROVES QUALITY OF LIFE IN ELDERS >/=65 YEARS, BUT STUDIES AMONG ELDERS WITH CHRONIC PAIN ARE LIMITED. OBJECTIVE: CONDUCT A FEASIBILITY STUDY OF GENTLE YOGA AMONG ELDERS IN ASSISTED AND INDEPENDENT LIVING. DESIGN: SINGLE ARM PRE/POST CLINICAL TRIAL. SUBJECTS: ADULTS (>/=65 YEARS OF AGE) WITH SELF-IDENTIFIED CHRONIC PAIN (>/=3 ON A 10-POINT SCALE, LASTING FOR >/=3 MONTHS) AND NO CURRENT YOGA PRACTICE. INTERVENTION: TEN WEEKLY 60-MIN GENTLE YOGA CLASSES TAILORED TO ELDERLY ADULTS. OUTCOME MEASURES: AT BASELINE, WEEKS 5, 10 (END OF INTERVENTION), AND 20 (FOLLOW-UP), WE COLLECTED DATA ON FEASIBILITY (ADHERENCE, RETENTION, SAFETY), PAIN, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION. RESULTS: TWENTY-SIX PARTICIPANTS ENROLLED (88% WOMEN, 77% WHITE, 58% IN ASSISTED LIVING) WITH AVERAGE AGE OF 86.6 +/- 4.4 (MEAN, STD). TWENTY PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE INTERVENTION, WITH 90% ADHERING (COMPLETING >/=6 CLASSES). NINE PARTICIPANTS (45% OF COMPLETERS) EXPERIENCED ADVERSE EVENTS, WHICH WERE NON-SERIOUS AND RELATED TO TRANSIENT MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN. NO ADVERSE EVENTS RESULTED IN STUDY WITHDRAWAL. PARTICIPANTS REPORTED BEING SOMEWHAT LIKELY TO RECOMMEND YOGA TO A FRIEND, AND QUITE A BIT LIKELY TO DO YOGA AGAIN. AT THE END OF THE INTERVENTION, FOUR OF TWENTY PARTICIPANTS REPORTED PRACTICING YOGA OUTSIDE OF CLASS. ANXIETY SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED FROM 5.80 (SE=0.90) TO 4.44 (SE=0.74) (P = 0.014), BUT THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN OTHER MEASURES. CONCLUSIONS: OUR PILOT 10-WEEK YOGA STUDY WAS GENERALLY SAFE FOR AND SUITABLE TO ASSISTED AND INDEPENDENT LIVING ELDERLY ADULTS. FUTURE STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO EXAMINE OTHER EFFECTS OF YOGA IN ASSISTED/INDEPENDENT LIVING ADULTS WITH CHRONIC PAIN.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
16 1267  37 FOLLOW-UP OF YOGA OF AWARENESS FOR FIBROMYALGIA: RESULTS AT 3 MONTHS AND REPLICATION IN THE WAIT-LIST GROUP. OBJECTIVES: PUBLISHED PRELIMINARY FINDINGS FROM A RANDOMIZED-CONTROLLED TRIAL SUGGEST THAT AN 8-WEEK YOGA OF AWARENESS INTERVENTION MAY BE EFFECTIVE FOR IMPROVING SYMPTOMS, FUNCTIONAL DEFICITS, AND COPING ABILITIES IN FIBROMYALGIA. THE PRIMARY AIMS OF THIS STUDY WERE TO EVALUATE THE SAME INTERVENTION'S POSTTREATMENT EFFECTS IN A WAIT-LIST GROUP AND TO TEST THE INTERVENTION'S EFFECTS AT 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP IN THE IMMEDIATE TREATMENT GROUP. METHODS: UNPAIRED T TESTS WERE USED TO COMPARE DATA FROM A PER PROTOCOL SAMPLE OF 21 WOMEN IN THE IMMEDIATE TREATMENT GROUP WHO HAD COMPLETED TREATMENT AND 18 WOMEN IN THE WAIT-LIST GROUP WHO HAD COMPLETED TREATMENT. WITHIN-GROUP PAIRED T TESTS WERE PERFORMED TO COMPARE POSTTREATMENT DATA WITH 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP DATA IN THE IMMEDIATE TREATMENT GROUP. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS THE FIBROMYALGIA IMPACT QUESTIONNAIRE REVISED (FIQR). MULTILEVEL RANDOM-EFFECTS MODELS WERE ALSO USED TO EXAMINE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN YOGA PRACTICE RATES AND OUTCOMES. RESULTS: POSTTREATMENT RESULTS IN THE WAIT-LIST GROUP LARGELY MIRRORED RESULTS SEEN AT POSTTREATMENT IN THE IMMEDIATE TREATMENT GROUP, WITH THE FIQR TOTAL SCORE IMPROVING BY 31.9% ACROSS THE 2 GROUPS. FOLLOW-UP RESULTS SHOWED THAT PATIENTS SUSTAINED MOST OF THEIR POSTTREATMENT GAINS, WITH THE FIQR TOTAL SCORE REMAINING 21.9% IMPROVED AT 3 MONTHS. YOGA PRACTICE RATES WERE GOOD, AND MORE PRACTICE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH MORE BENEFIT FOR A VARIETY OF OUTCOMES. DISCUSSION: THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE BENEFITS OF YOGA OF AWARENESS IN FIBROMYALGIA ARE REPLICABLE AND CAN BE MAINTAINED.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
17 1380  42 IMPACT OF LONG TERM YOGA PRACTICE ON SLEEP QUALITY AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE ELDERLY. BACKGROUND: SLEEP DISTURBANCES AND DECLINE IN THE PHYSICAL FUNCTIONALITY ARE COMMON CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH AGING. PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF SLEEP DISTURBANCES CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS ADVERSE EFFECTS. SHORT TERM TRIALS OF YOGA ON SLEEP HAVE SHOWN BENEFICIAL EFFECTS. OBJECTIVES: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF LONG-TERM YOGA EXERCISES ON SLEEP QUALITY AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) IN THE ELDERLY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS WAS A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY IN WHICH DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM ELDERLY PEOPLE AGED 60 YEARS OR MORE LIVING IN NAGPUR CITY. WE EMPLOYED TWO TYPES OF SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRES: PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI) AND QOL LEIDEN-PADUA (LEIPAD) QUESTIONNAIRE. A TOTAL OF 65 ELDERLY MEN AND WOMEN WHO SIGNED AN INFORMED CONSENT AND COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. SLEEP QUALITY SCORE PSQI AND QOL (LEIPAD QUESTIONNAIRE) SCORE OF THE STUDY GROUP WERE EVALUATED AND COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP USING MANN-WHITNEY U TEST. RESULTS: TOTAL PSQI SCORE IN YOGA GROUP WAS LOWER THAN THAT OF THE CONTROL GROUP. ALSO VARIOUS QOL SCORES OF THE YOGA GROUPS WERE HIGHER THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: ADDITION OF REGULAR YOGA EXERCISES IN THE DAILY ROUTINE OF ELDERLY PEOPLE CAN HELP TO ACHIEVE GOOD SLEEP QUALITY AS WELL AS IMPROVE THE QOL.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
18 2361  51 VIVEKANANDA YOGA PROGRAM FOR PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED LUNG CANCER AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS. BACKGROUND: THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ESTABLISH THE FEASIBILITY OF A COUPLE-BASED VIVEKANANDA YOGA (VKC) INTERVENTION IN LUNG CANCER PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS. SECONDLY, WE EXAMINED PRELIMINARY EFFICACY REGARDING QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) OUTCOMES. METHOD: IN THIS SINGLE-ARM FEASIBILITY TRIAL, PATIENTS WITH LUNG CANCER UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS PARTICIPATED IN A 15-SESSION VKC PROGRAM THAT FOCUSED ON THE INTERCONNECTEDNESS OF THE DYAD. WE ASSESSED PRE-AND POST-INTERVENTION LEVELS OF FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCES, PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, OVERALL QOL, SPIRITUALITY, AND RELATIONAL CLOSENESS. WE TRACKED FEASIBILITY DATA, AND PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED PROGRAM EVALUATIONS. RESULTS: WE APPROACHED 28 ELIGIBLE DYADS OF WHICH 15 (53%) CONSENTED AND 9 (60%) COMPLETED THE INTERVENTION. PATIENTS (MEAN AGE = 73 YEARS, 63% FEMALE, ALL STAGE III) AND CAREGIVERS (MEAN AGE = 62 YEARS, 38% FEMALE, 63% SPOUSES) COMPLETED A MEAN OF 10 SESSIONS AND 95.5% OF THEM RATED THE PROGRAM AS VERY USEFUL. PAIRED T TESTS REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PATIENTS' MENTAL HEALTH (D = 0.84; P = .04) AND A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN CAREGIVERS' SLEEP DISTURBANCES (D = 1.44; P = .02). ALTHOUGH NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT, FOR PATIENTS, EFFECT SIZES FOR CHANGE SCORES WERE MEDIUM FOR BENEFIT FINDING AND SMALL FOR DISTRESS (D = 0.65 AND 0.37, RESPECTIVELY). FOR CAREGIVERS, MEDIUM EFFECTS WERE FOUND FOR IMPROVEMENT IN PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING (D = 0.50). CONCLUSION: THIS NOVEL SUPPORTIVE CARE PROGRAM APPEARS TO BE SAFE, FEASIBLE, ACCEPTABLE, AND SUBJECTIVELY USEFUL FOR LUNG CANCER PATIENTS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS AND LENDS SUPPORT FOR FURTHER STUDY.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
19 2613  38 YOGA FOR RISK REDUCTION OF METABOLIC SYNDROME: PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES FROM A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY. LIFESTYLE CHANGE IS RECOMMENDED AS TREATMENT FOR ADULTS AT RISK FOR METABOLIC SYNDROME (METS), ALTHOUGH ADOPTION OF NEW BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS IS LIMITED. IN ADDITION, MOST EXISTING LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS DO NOT ADDRESS PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS OR QUALITY OF LIFE, BOTH OF WHICH IMPACT THE BURDEN OF METS. YOGA, A FORM OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THAT INCORPORATES PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPONENTS (E.G., MAINTAINING ATTENTION, RELAXATION), IS A PROMISING INTERVENTION FOR IMPROVING THE BURDEN OF METS. THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL ASSESSED THE FEASIBILITY AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF A 12-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM COUPLED WITH AN EVIDENCE-BASED HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAM (HED) COMPARED TO HED ALONE. A SECONDARY, EXPLORATORY AIM EXAMINED PERCEIVED STRESS, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND RELATED PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES (MINDFULNESS, PERCEIVED HEALTH COMPETENCE, AND MOOD). SIXTY-SEVEN ADULTS AT RISK FOR METS ENROLLED (MEAN AGE [SD]: 58 [10] YEARS; 50% MALE; 79% NON-HISPANIC WHITE). PRELIMINARY RESULTS REVEALED SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER IMPROVEMENTS IN TWO QUALITY OF LIFE DOMAINS (ROLE-PHYSICAL AND GENERAL HEALTH PERCEPTIONS) IN THE HED PLUS YOGA GROUP VERSUS HED ALONE (PS < 0.05). THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY THAT IMPLEMENTED LIFESTYLE EDUCATION ALONG WITH YOGA TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL UNIQUE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PARTICIPANTS AT RISK FOR METS. A LARGER CLINICAL TRIAL IS WARRANTED TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE THESE PROMISING PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
20 2811  48 YOGA TO PREVENT MOBILITY LIMITATIONS IN OLDER ADULTS: FEASIBILITY OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: THE LOSS OF MOBILITY DURING AGING IMPACTS INDEPENDENCE AND LEADS TO FURTHER DISABILITY, MORBIDITY, AND REDUCED LIFE EXPECTANCY. OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND SAFETY OF CONDUCTING A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA FOR OLDER ADULTS AT RISK FOR MOBILITY LIMITATIONS. METHODS: SEDENTARY OLDER ADULTS (N = 46; AGE 60-89) WERE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED TO EITHER YOGA OR A HEALTH EDUCATION COMPARISON GROUP. YOGA SESSIONS (60-MIN) OCCURRED 2X WEEKLY, AND 90-MIN HEALTH EDUCATION SESSIONS OCCURRED WEEKLY, FOR 10 WEEKS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE RECRUITMENT RATE, INTERVENTION ATTENDANCE, AND RETENTION AT ASSESSMENTS. ADVERSE EVENT RATES AND PARTICIPANT SATISFACTION WERE ALSO MEASURED. PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES OF GAIT, BALANCE, AND STRENGTH AND SELF-REPORT OUTCOME MEASURES WERE ADMINISTERED AT BASELINE AND 10-WEEKS. RESULTS: RECRUITMENT LASTED 6 MONTHS. RETENTION OF PARTICIPANTS AT THE 10-WEEK FOLLOW-UP WAS HIGH (89% - PERFORMANCE MEASURES; 98% - SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES). ATTENDANCE WAS GOOD WITH 82% OF YOGA AND 74% OF HEALTH EDUCATION PARTICIPANTS ATTENDING AT LEAST 50% OF THE SESSIONS. NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. PATIENT SATISFACTION WITH THE INTERVENTIONS WAS HIGH. THE MEAN EFFECT SIZE FOR THE PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES WAS 0.35 WITH SOME OVER 0.50. THE MEAN EFFECT SIZE FOR SELF-REPORT OUTCOME MEASURES WAS 0.36. CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS INDICATE THAT IT IS FEASIBLE TO CONDUCT A LARGER RCT OF YOGA FOR SEDENTARY OLDER ADULTS AT RISK FOR MOBILITY PROBLEMS. THE YOGA AND COMPARISON INTERVENTIONS WERE SAFE, WELL ACCEPTED, AND WELL ATTENDED. EFFECT SIZES SUGGEST YOGA MAY HAVE IMPORTANT BENEFITS FOR THIS POPULATION AND SHOULD BE STUDIED FURTHER.

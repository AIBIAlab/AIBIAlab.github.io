1 2190 74 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA PARTICIPATION ON WOMEN'S QUALITY OF LIFE AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT DURING THE MENOPAUSAL TRANSITION: A PILOT STUDY. TYPICALLY LASTING 5-10 YEARS, THE MENOPAUSAL TRANSITION IS ASSOCIATED WITH SYMPTOMS INCLUDING HOT FLASHES, NIGHT SWEATS, AND LABILE MOOD. AS THESE SYMPTOMS OFTEN HINDER A WOMAN'S SUCCESSFUL FUNCTIONING IN EVERYDAY LIFE, HORMONE THERAPY IS COMMONLY PRESCRIBED AS A MEANS TO DIMINISH SYMPTOMS. MANY WOMEN, HOWEVER, ARE SEEKING COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE TREATMENTS DUE TO SIDE EFFECTS AND/OR DETRIMENTAL HEALTH-RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CONVENTIONAL THERAPIES. WE COMPLETED A MIXED METHODS STUDY TO DETERMINE CHANGES IN PHYSIOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH MENOPAUSE AND CHANGES IN WOMEN'S QUALITY OF LIFE, AS A RESULT OF PARTICIPATION IN A 10-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
2 1152 31 ENHANCING PROBLEM- AND EMOTION-FOCUSED COPING IN MENOPAUSAL WOMEN THROUGH YOGA. IN VARYING DEGREES, ALL WOMEN EXPERIENCE MENOPAUSE, THE CONDITION OF INFERTILITY DUE TO ALTERED REPRODUCTIVE HORMONES. THE MENOPAUSAL TRANSITION INCLUDES THREE PHASES-PERIMENOPAUSE, MENOPAUSE, AND POSTMENOPAUSE-EACH ASSOCIATED WITH PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS THAT CAN NEGATIVELY AFFECT WOMEN'S SUCCESSFUL FUNCTIONING IN EVERYDAY LIFE. IN ADDITION TO CONVENTIONAL THERAPIES INTENDED TO DECREASE THE FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY OF SYMPTOMS, MENOPAUSAL WOMEN ARE IN NEED OF COPING MECHANISMS TO ASSIST IN MANAGING SYMPTOMS AS THEY OCCUR. USING A DEDUCTIVE APPROACH, A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF 12 INDIVIDUALS' QUALITATIVE JOURNAL ENTRIES AND SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS OBTAINED FROM A MIXED-METHODS EMBEDDED RESEARCH STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE WHETHER DATA EXIST TO SUPPORT YOGA AS A MEANS FOR COPING AS PRESENTED BY LAZARUS AND FOLKMAN'S TRANSACTIONAL THEORY OF STRESS AND COPING AND BY IWASAKI AND MANNELL'S LEISURE STRESS COPING CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK. RESULTS INDICATE THAT YOGA HAS THE POTENTIAL FOR SERVING AS A COPING MECHANISM FOR WOMEN BETWEEN THE AGES OF 40 AND 65 WHO ARE EXPERIENCING MENOPAUSE AND WANT TO IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH AND/OR ENHANCE THEIR ABILITY TO MANAGE LIFE'S STRESSORS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, FINDINGS DISCUSSED IN THIS ARTICLE ADVOCATE YOGA AS BEING A LEISURE ACTIVITY IN WHICH PROBLEM- AND EMOTION-FOCUSED COPING STRATEGIES CAN DEVELOP, INCLUDING MECHANISMS NECESSARY FOR PALLIATIVE COPING, MOOD ENHANCEMENT, AND SOCIAL COMPANIONSHIP. TO THE AUTHORS' KNOWLEDGE, DATA REPORTED IN THIS MANUSCRIPT ARE THE FIRST TO SUPPORT THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK OF CROWE, VAN PUYMBROECK, AND SCHMID, AIMED AT EXPLAINING YOGA AS A VIABLE LEISURE COPING STRATEGY. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH FOCUSED ON THE PSYCHOSOCIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA, INCLUDING YOGA AS COPING, IS RECOMMENDED.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
3 2372 23 WHAT HELPS OLDER PEOPLE PERSEVERE WITH YOGA CLASSES? A REALIST PROCESS EVALUATION OF A COVID-19-AFFECTED YOGA PROGRAM FOR FALL PREVENTION. BACKGROUND: FALLS AMONG OLDER PEOPLE ARE A MAJOR GLOBAL HEALTH CONCERN. THIS PROCESS EVALUATION INVESTIGATES THE EXPERIENCE OF PARTICIPANTS AGED 60+ IN A YOGA PROGRAM AIMED AT PREVENTING FALLS WHICH TRANSITIONED FROM STUDIO-BASED CLASSES TO ONLINE CLASSES IN RESPONSE TO COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS. WE SOUGHT TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE SUCCESSFUL AGEING (SAGE) YOGA PROGRAM FUNCTIONED IN BOTH SETTINGS AND AS A HYBRID PROGRAM, AND TO EXPLAIN WHY IT WORKED WELL FOR MOST PARTICIPANTS. METHODS: REALIST PROCESS EVALUATION WAS USED TO EXPLORE THE FACTORS THAT FACILITATED A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION FOR MOST PARTICIPANTS, AND TO CONSIDER WHY IT DID NOT WORK FOR A MINORITY. THIS APPROACH DEVELOPS PROGRAM THEORIES THAT DESCRIBE WHICH MECHANISMS AN INTERVENTION IS (OR IS NOT) ACTIVATING, AND HOW THIS IS MEDIATED BY CONTEXT TO GENERATE PROCESS OUTCOMES. DATA INCLUDED INTERVIEWS WITH PARTICIPANTS (N = 21) AND YOGA INSTRUCTORS (N = 3), SELF-REPORT FEEDBACK FORMS (N = 46), OBSERVATION OF CLASSES AND ROUTINE PROCESS MEASURES. RESULTS: FACTORS THAT FACILITATED A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION FOR MOST PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED THE QUALITY OF YOGA INSTRUCTION, THE PROGRAM FORMAT AND INHERENT CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA. GAINS IN TRANSITIONING ONLINE INCLUDED CONTINUITY AND GREATER CONVENIENCE. LOSSES INCLUDED PERCEIVED REDUCTION IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA INSTRUCTION. THERE WERE GREATER CHALLENGES FOR PEOPLE STRUGGLING WITH PAIN AND IN DISADVANTAGEOUS HOME ENVIRONMENTS. WE IDENTIFIED SIX PROGRAM THEORIES CONFIGURED AROUND 16 MECHANISMS: 1. IT'S WORTH THE EFFORT AND 2. IN EXPERT HANDS (THESE HAD THE SAME MECHANISMS: VALUE EXPECTANCY, THERAPEUTIC ALLIANCE AND ACHIEVEMENT/MASTERY), 3. A COMMUNAL EXPERIENCE (THESE MECHANISMS WERE SHARED EXPERIENCE, SOCIAL CONNECTION, SOCIAL COMPARISON AND PEER CHECKING), 4. PUTTING YOGA WITHIN REACH (ACCESSIBILITY, CONVENIENCE, GRATITUDE), 5. BUILDING YOGA HABITS (PURPOSEFUL STRUCTURE, MOMENTUM, ACCOUNTABILITY AND CONTINUITY), AND 6. YOGA'S SPECIAL PROPERTIES (EMBODIMENT AND MINDFULNESS). CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT ONLINE DELIVERY OF A YOGA PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE AGED 60+ RETAINED MUCH OF THE VALUE OF A FACE-TO-FACE PROGRAM FOR THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS, AND INCREASED THE VALUE FOR SOME. THE STRUCTURED, COMMUNAL NATURE OF AN ORGANISED GROUP PROGRAM DELIVERED BY A SKILLED INSTRUCTOR, TOGETHER WITH YOGA'S INTRINSIC FOCUS ON MINDFULNESS, FACILITATED CONTINUED ENGAGEMENT AND PERCEIVED HEALTH BENEFITS, DESPITE THE CHANGE IN DELIVERY MODE.	2022	

4 1974 19 SILVER YOGA EXERCISES IMPROVED PHYSICAL FITNESS OF TRANSITIONAL FRAIL ELDERS. BACKGROUND: PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF TRANSITIONAL FRAIL ELDERS (E.G., THROUGH THERAPEUTIC-BASED YOGA EXERCISES) IS ESSENTIAL TO REDUCE HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES CAUSED BY CHRONIC HEALTH PROBLEMS. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF 24 WEEKS OF THE SENIOR-TAILORED SILVER YOGA (SY) EXERCISE PROGRAM FOR TRANSITIONAL FRAIL ELDERS. METHODS: A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF 69 ELDERS IN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES WERE ASSIGNED RANDOMLY TO THE SY GROUP (N = 38) OR TO THE CONTROL GROUP (N = 31) ON THE BASIS OF THE FACILITIES WHERE THEY RESIDED, AND 55 OF THEM COMPLETED THIS QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL PRETEST AND POSTTEST STUDY. INTERVENTION WAS CONDUCTED THREE TIMES PER WEEK, 70 MINUTES PER SESSION, FOR 24 WEEKS. PHYSICAL FITNESS (BODY COMPOSITION, CARDIOVASCULAR-RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS, BODY FLEXIBILITY, MUSCLE POWER AND ENDURANCE, BALANCE, AND AGILITY) WERE EXAMINED AT BASELINE, AT 12 WEEKS, AND AT THE END OF THE 24TH WEEK OF THE STUDY. RESULTS: AT THE END OF THE STUDY, THE PHYSICAL FITNESS INDICATORS OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE SY GROUP HAD IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY, AND THEY HAD BETTER PHYSICAL FITNESS THAN PARTICIPANTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP (ALL P VALUES < .05). DISCUSSION: IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT THE SY EXERCISES BE INCORPORATED AS AN ACTIVITY PROGRAM IN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES TO PROMOTE THE PHYSICAL FITNESS OF TRANSITIONAL FRAIL ELDERS.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
5 2002 16 STRESS, SUBSTANCE USE, AND YOGA IN THE CONTEXT OF COMMUNITY REENTRY FOLLOWING INCARCERATION. THIS FIELD REPORT PROVIDES A RATIONALE FOR THE POTENTIAL OF YOGA TO SUPPORT REDUCTIONS IN STRESS AND SUBSTANCE USE AMONG PEOPLE RETURNING TO THE COMMUNITY FROM JAIL OR PRISON AND DESCRIBES AN AGENCY-BASED EXAMPLE OF YOGA CLASSES OFFERED IN THIS CONTEXT. PEOPLE WHO HAVE RECENTLY EXPERIENCED INCARCERATION FACE A MULTITUDE OF STRESSORS, WHICH CAN HEIGHTEN THE RISK OF SUBSTANCE USE AND SUPPORT THE NEED TO ADDRESS STRESS REDUCTION AS A PATHWAY TO REDUCED SUBSTANCE USE. ONE PROMISING INTERVENTION IS YOGA, WHICH HAS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT STRESS-REDUCTION EFFECTS AMONG SEVERAL POPULATIONS. FEEDBACK FROM PARTICIPANTS IN THIS FIELD REPORT'S PRACTICE EXAMPLE REINFORCES THE POTENTIAL FOR YOGA TO DECREASE STRESS AND COMPLEMENT SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT IN SUPPORTING HEALTH DURING THE TRANSITION FROM INCARCERATION TO COMMUNITY RETURN. FURTHER SCHOLARSHIP IS NEEDED TO EXPLORE THE BENEFITS AND LIMITATIONS OF YOGA IN THIS CONTEXT.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
6 2360 17 VIDEOCONFERENCED YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR CANCER PATIENTS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC: A REPORT FROM A CLINICIAN'S PERSPECTIVE. BACKGROUND: THE ACCEPTABILITY OF VIDEOCONFERENCING DELIVERY OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN THE ADVANCED CANCER SETTING IS RELATIVELY UNEXPLORED. THE CURRENT REPORT SUMMARIZES THE CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS OF THE TRANSITION FROM AN IN-PERSON (IE, FACE-TO-FACE) TO A VIDEOCONFERENCE INTERVENTION DELIVERY APPROACH IN RESPONSE TO THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE PANDEMIC. METHOD: PARTICIPANTS INCLUDED PATIENT-FAMILY CAREGIVER DYADS WHO WERE ENROLLED IN ONGOING YOGA TRIALS AND 2 CERTIFIED YOGA THERAPISTS WHO DELIVERED THE YOGA SESSIONS. WE SUMMARIZED THEIR EXPERIENCES USING RECORDINGS OF THE YOGA SESSIONS AND INTERVENTIONISTS' PROGRESS NOTES. RESULTS: OUT OF 7 DYADS PARTICIPATING IN THE PARENT TRIAL, 1 DECLINED THE VIDEOCONFERENCED SESSIONS. PARTICIPANTS WERE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 55 AND 76 AND MOSTLY NON-HISPANIC WHITE (83%). PATIENTS WERE MAINLY MALE (83%), ALL HAD STAGE III OR IV CANCER AND WERE UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY. CAREGIVERS WERE ALL FEMALE. DESPITE CHALLENGES IN THE AREAS OF TECHNOLOGY, LOCATION, AND SETTING, INSTRUCTION AND PERSONAL CONNECTION, THE OVERALL ACCEPTABILITY WAS HIGH AMONG PATIENTS, CAREGIVERS, AND INSTRUCTORS. THROUGH THIS TRANSITION PROCESS, SOLUTIONS TO THESE CHALLENGES WERE FOUND, WHICH ARE DESCRIBED HERE. CONCLUSION: ALTHOUGH IN-PERSON INTERVENTIONS ARE FAVORED BY BOTH THE STUDY PARTICIPANTS AND THE INTERVENTIONISTS, VIDEOCONFERENCE SESSIONS WERE DEEMED ACCEPTABLE. ALL PARTICIPANTS HAD THE BENEFIT OF A PREVIOUS IN-PERSON EXPERIENCE, WHICH WAS HELPFUL AND PERHAPS NECESSARY FOR OLDER AND ADVANCED CANCER PATIENTS REQUIRING PRACTICE MODIFICATIONS.

8 1230 21 FEASIBILITY AND OUTCOME OF AN ONLINE STREAMED YOGA INTERVENTION ON STRESS AND WELLBEING OF PEOPLE WORKING FROM HOME DURING COVID-19. BACKGROUND: THE OUTBREAK OF COVID-19 AND ITS ASSOCIATED MEASURES HAS RESULTED IN A SIZEABLE WORKING POPULATION TRANSITIONING TO WORKING FROM HOME (WFH), BRINGING ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES, AND INCREASING WORK-RELATED STRESS. RESEARCH HAS INDICATED THAT YOGA HAS PROMISING POTENTIAL IN REDUCING STRESS IN THE WORKPLACE. HOWEVER, THERE ARE VERY FEW STUDIES EXPLORING THE IMPACT OF ONLINE STREAMED YOGA ON STRESS MANAGEMENT FOR PEOPLE-WFH. OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY AND OUTCOME OF AN ONLINE STREAMED YOGA INTERVENTION ON STRESS AND WELLBEING OF PEOPLE-WFH DURING COVID-19. METHODS: A SIX-WEEK PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) YOGA INTERVENTION WAS DESIGNED WITH YOGA (N = 26) AND A WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 26). A MIXED TWO-WAY ANOVA WAS USED TO ASSESS CHANGES IN STANDARDISED OUTCOME MEASURES AT BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION. LIKERT AND OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS ASSESSED ENJOYMENT, ACCEPTABILITY AND PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM, WHICH WERE ANALYSED THEMATICALLY. RESULTS: COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL, THE YOGA GROUP REPORTED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN PERCEIVED STRESS, MENTAL WELLBEING, DEPRESSION AND COPING SELF-EFFICACY, BUT NOT STRESS AND ANXIETY. PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCED PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS AND REPORTED HIGH ACCEPTABILITY AND ENJOYMENT OF THE INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: AN ONLINE YOGA INTERVENTION CAN HELP PEOPLE WFH MANAGE STRESS AND ENHANCE WELLBEING AND COPING ABILITIES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
9 1892 22 RELAX WHILE YOU REHABILITATE: A PILOT STUDY INTEGRATING A NOVEL, YOGA-BASED MINDFULNESS GROUP INTERVENTION INTO A RESIDENTIAL MILITARY BRAIN INJURY REHABILITATION PROGRAM. OBJECTIVE: THIS PRELIMINARY, PILOT STUDY ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A GROUP-BASED, MINDFULNESS INTERVENTION IN A RESIDENTIAL, REHABILITATION SETTING WITH SPECIFIC FOCUS ON ASSESSING PARTICIPANTS' SELF-REPORT OF PERCEIVED BENEFIT OF THE INTERVENTION ON OVERALL HEALTH, PAIN, SLEEP, MOOD/ANXIETY, ATTENTION, AND SELF-AWARENESS, AS WELL AS IMPLEMENTING MODIFICATIONS NEEDED FOR SUCCESSFUL INTERVENTION APPLICATION AMONG A DIVERSE, CLINICAL MILITARY POPULATION. METHOD/DESIGN: PARTICIPANTS WERE 19 VETERANS AND ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBERS WITH A HISTORY OF TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI; 63% SEVERE) WHO COMPLETED A MINDFULNESS-BASED GROUP INTERVENTION DURING INPATIENT ADMISSION AT A VETERANS AFFAIRS POLYTRAUMA TRANSITIONAL REHABILITATION PROGRAM (PTRP). MINDFULNESS AND YOGA SKILLS WERE TAUGHT IN A REQUIRED, WEEKLY GROUP INCORPORATED INTO PARTICIPANTS' REHABILITATION SCHEDULE. OPINIONS AND ATTITUDES ABOUT MINDFULNESS, AS WELL AS PERTINENT SELF-REPORT OUTCOME MEASURES, WERE OBTAINED PRE- AND POSTGROUP PARTICIPATION. RESULTS: RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT PARTICIPATION IN THE GROUP WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH INDIVIDUALS' SELF-REPORTED BELIEF ABOUT THE BENEFIT OF MINDFULNESS IN THE AREAS OF OVERALL HEALTH, PHYSICAL HEALTH, MOOD, FOCUS, AND SELF-AWARENESS. THE MORE GROUPS ATTENDED, THE MORE POSITIVE THE PARTICIPANTS' BELIEFS ABOUT POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OVERALL HEALTH AND MOOD BECAME, EVEN WHILE CONTROLLING FOR LENGTH OF REHABILITATION STAY. ADDITIONALLY, SEVERAL SPECIFIC GROUP MODIFICATIONS RELEVANT TO THIS POPULATION (E.G., PHYSICAL/ENVIRONMENTAL MODIFICATIONS, REPETITION, IGNORING/REORIENTING) WERE IMPLEMENTED TO SUPPORT SUCCESSFUL PARTICIPATION. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: THESE PRELIMINARY AND EXPLORATORY FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT IT MAY BE WORTHWHILE FOR PSYCHOLOGISTS, CLINICIANS, AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WORKING WITH A MIXED TBI POPULATION, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY A MILITARY POPULATION WITH TBI, TO CONSIDER INTRODUCING MINDFULNESS SKILLS AS PART OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY REHABILITATION.

10 2015 15 SUGGESTIONS FOR ADAPTING YOGA TO THE NEEDS OF OLDER ADULTS WITH OSTEOPOROSIS. BACKGROUND: EXERCISE SUCH AS YOGA MAY HAVE HEALTH BENEFITS FOR OLDER ADULTS WITH OSTEOPOROSIS, BUT WITHOUT ATTENTION TO SAFE MOVEMENT YOGA CAN ALSO INCREASE THE RISK FOR INJURY. OBJECTIVE: THE CURRENT ARTICLE PROVIDES SUGGESTIONS FOR HOW TO ADAPT YOGA TO THE NEEDS OF OLDER ADULTS WITH OSTEOPOROSIS. SUGGESTIONS: A GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR EXERCISE IS THAT OLDER ADULTS WITH OSTEOPOROSIS SHOULD PARTICIPATE IN A MULTICOMPONENT EXERCISE PROGRAM, INCLUDING RESISTANCE AND BALANCE TRAINING. CONTRAINDICATED MOVEMENTS INCLUDE END-RANGE FLEXION/EXTENSION/ROTATION OF THE SPINE AND INTERNAL/EXTERNAL ROTATION OF THE HIP. YOGA POSTURES THAT SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED INCLUDE POSTURES EMPHASIZING SPINAL ALIGNMENT AND EXTENSION TO MID-RANGE IN STANDING AND ON THE FLOOR. OVERARCHING CONSIDERATIONS FOR PARTICIPATION IN YOGA ARE THAT CLASSES SHOULD BE DESIGNED FOR HIGHER-RISK OLDER ADULTS, LED BY AN INSTRUCTOR WHO HAS HAD PROPER TRAINING WITH INDIVIDUALS WITH OSTEOPOROSIS, SHOULD BE A NONCOMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, AND SHOULD GIVE ATTENTION TO WHICH POSTURES ARE SAFE AND HOW TO TRANSITION SAFELY.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
11 2028 16 TAI CHI AND YOGA IN RESIDENTIAL AGED CARE: PERSPECTIVES OF PARTICIPANTS: A QUALITATIVE STUDY. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY EXAMINED THE APPROPRIATENESS AND ACCEPTABILITY OF 14-WEEK MODIFIED TAI CHI AND YOGA PROGRAMMES IN AN AUSTRALIAN RESIDENTIAL AGED CARE (RAC) SETTING BY EXPLORING EXPERIENCES AND PERSPECTIVES OF FRAIL OLDER RESIDENTS AND STAFF PARTICIPANTS. BACKGROUND: OLDER PERSONS IN RAC HAVE LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. TAI CHI AND YOGA ARE MINDFULNESS-BASED EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN USED TO PROMOTE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH OF OLDER ADULTS IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS. WHILE RESEARCH ON TAI CHI AND YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS IS PROMISING, THERE IS LIMITED RESEARCH REGARDING THE INTERVENTIONS' APPROPRIATENESS AND ACCEPTABILITY FOR FRAIL OLDER RESIDENTS IN RESIDENTIAL CARE SETTINGS IN AUSTRALIA. DESIGN: DESCRIPTIVE AND QUALITATIVE COMPONENT OF A MIXED-METHODS STUDY. METHODS: ALL RESIDENTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE MODIFIED YOGA AND TAI CHI INTERVENTIONS AND STAFF WHO SUPPORTED THEM WERE INVITED. A TOTAL OF 19 INDIVIDUALS COMPRISING 16 RESIDENTS AND THREE STAFF MEMBERS PARTICIPATED IN THREE FOCUS GROUP INTERVIEWS. THE INTERVIEWS WERE AUDIO-RECORDED, TRANSCRIBED AND ANALYSED THEMATICALLY USING A QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTIVE APPROACH. RESULTS: NINE THEMES THAT REFLECTED THE UNIQUENESS OF THE PROGRAMMES' MIND-BODY APPROACH ARE PRESENTED: (A) NOVEL, NEW AND EXCITING; (B) SMOOTHNESS, RHYTHM AND FLOW; (C) SLOW AND MINDFUL; (D) GENTLE BUT REWARDING; (E) MOVING WHOLE BODY; (F) PERCEIVED BENEFITS; (G) WORTHWHILE; (H) FEELING ALIVE; AND (I) CALMING AND RELAXING. CONCLUSIONS: THE MODIFIED PROGRAMMES OF TAI CHI AND YOGA WAS ACCEPTABLE, APPROPRIATE, ENJOYABLE AND HELPFUL. BOTH TAI CHI AND YOGA APPEAR TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE PHYSICAL EXERCISE AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR OLDER PERSONS TO ENHANCE THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE THROUGH INTERACTION OF PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL AND INTELLECTUAL WELLNESS DOMAINS. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: THE 14-WEEK MODIFIED PROGRAMMES OF TAI CHI AND YOGA COULD BE APPLIED TO FRAIL OLDER RAC POPULATION TO PROMOTE HEALTH AND ACTIVE AGEING.	2018

THE MOST COMMONLY PERFORMED YOGA PRACTICES ARE POSTURES (ASANA), CONTROLLED BREATHING (PRANAYAMA), AND MEDITATION (DHYANA). YOGA HAS BEEN UTILIZED AS A THERAPEUTIC TOOL TO ACHIEVE POSITIVE HEALTH AND CONTROL AND CURE DISEASES. THE EXACT MECHANISM AS TO HOW YOGA HELPS IN VARIOUS DISEASE STATES IS NOT KNOWN. THERE COULD BE NEURO-HORMONAL PATHWAYS WITH A SELECTIVE EFFECT IN EACH PATHOLOGICAL SITUATION. THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE STUDIES THAT HAVE COMBINED THE MANY ASPECTS OF YOGA INTO A GENERAL YOGA SESSION IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE ITS EFFECTS ON MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS. INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY CAN IMPROVE HOT FLUSHES AND NIGHT SWEATS. THERE IS INCREASING EVIDENCE SUGGESTING THAT EVEN THE SHORT-TERM PRACTICE OF YOGA CAN DECREASE BOTH PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (CVD). STUDIES CONCLUDE THAT OUR AGE OLD THERAPY, YOGA, IS FAIRLY EFFECTIVE IN MANAGING MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
13 1843 22 QUALITATIVE EVALUATION OF A HIGH SCHOOL YOGA PROGRAM: FEASIBILITY AND PERCEIVED BENEFITS. THIS IS THE FIRST PUBLISHED QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT OF A YOGA PROGRAM APPLIED IN A HIGH SCHOOL SETTING. THIS QUALITATIVE INTERVIEW STUDY WAS NESTED IN A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL STUDYING THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA PROGRAM OFFERED IN PLACE OF A SEMESTER OF PHYSICAL EDUCATION CLASSES AT A RURAL PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL. STUDENT INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED AFTER TAKING PART IN A SEMESTER OF THE YOGA PROGRAM. A FORMAL PASSIVE CONSENT WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE QUALITATIVE STUDY WAS SENT HOME TO PARENTS/GUARDIANS OF ALL STUDENTS IN THE PARENT STUDY BEFORE THE INTERVIEWS. MOST STUDENTS ENJOYED THE YOGA CLASSES AND FELT BENEFITS. NEGATIVE REPORTS OF YOGA PRACTICE WERE ASSOCIATED WITH GENDER AS MOST MALES SENSED PEER PRESSURE AGAINST PRACTICING YOGA. DESPITE THIS FINDING, MOST STUDENTS WANTED TO CONTINUE YOGA AND WOULD CONTINUE IF IT WERE OFFERED IN SCHOOL. POSITIVE REPORTS INCLUDE A GREATER KINESTHETIC AWARENESS, WHICH SOME STUDENTS ASSOCIATED WITH A GREATER RESPECT FOR THE BODY AND IMPROVED SELF-IMAGE. AMONG STUDENTS REPORTING PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFITS, MANY CITED STRESS REDUCTION; MANY USED YOGA TO MANAGE NEGATIVE EMOTIONS; AND SOME PROPAGATED MORE OPTIMISM. MOST THOUGHT YOGA COULD REDUCE INTEREST IN THE USE OF DRUGS AND ALCOHOL AND INCREASE SOCIAL COHESION WITH FAMILY AND PEERS. WE FOUND THAT A YOGA PROGRAM IS FEASIBLE IN THIS SAMPLE OF 9TH AND 10TH GRADERS, ESPECIALLY AFTER BENEFITS ARE PERCEIVED. WE ALSO FOUND EVIDENCE THAT YOGA MAY LEAD TO EMERGENT POSITIVE BENEFITS IN HEALTH BEHAVIORS NOT DIRECTLY PRESCRIBED BY THE PROGRAM. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT SCHOOL-BASED YOGA PROGRAMS MAY BE APPROPRIATE FOR PROMOTING HEALTHY BEHAVIORS AT A SOCIETAL LEVEL BY FOCUSING ON THE PREVENTION OF NEGATIVE PATTERNS DURING THE ADOLESCENT TRANSITION.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
14 1333 17 HOT YOGA ESTABLISHMENTS IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES SERVING PREGNANT WOMEN: A PILOT STUDY ON THE HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF ITS PRACTICE AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS. HOT YOGA ESTABLISHMENTS HAVE BEEN INCREASING IN POPULARITY IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES. STUDIOS MAY SUPPORT PARTICIPATION AMONG PREGNANT WOMEN THOUGH NO CLINICAL STUDIES CURRENTLY EXIST THAT EXAMINE PRENATAL HOT YOGA EFFECTS. THE PILOT STUDY DESCRIBED IN THIS ARTICLE AIMED TO ASSESS THE SPREAD OF PRENATAL HOT YOGA AND TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND PRACTICES OF THOSE WHO ENGAGE IN HOT YOGA WITHIN A LOCAL COMMUNITY. A THERMAL ENVIRONMENT METER WAS USED TO MEASURE AMBIENT AIR CONDITIONS DURING THREE 90-MINUTE HOT YOGA CLASSES. MOTHERS WHO PRACTICED PRENATAL HOT YOGA WERE MORE LIKELY THAN NON-HOT YOGA PRACTITIONERS TO HAVE SOMEONE ASIDE FROM AN OBSTETRICIAN/GYNECOLOGIST DISCUSS PRENATAL EXERCISE SAFETY WITH THEM. PRENATAL PUBLIC HEALTH EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS NEED TO BE REFINED. PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS AND OBSTETRICIANS/GYNECOLOGISTS NEED TO BE AWARE THAT THOSE WHO ENGAGE IN A HOT YOGA PRACTICE ARE MORE LIKELY TO TRUST SOMEONE OTHER THAN THEIR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER OR PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONAL REGARDING SAFETY OF THIS PRACTICE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
15 1343 19 HOW YOGA IMPACTS THE SUBSTANCE USE OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV WHO ARE IN REENTRY FROM PRISON OR JAIL: A QUALITATIVE STUDY. OBJECTIVES: NASCENT RESEARCH REFLECTS THE PROMISE OF YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR SUBSTANCE USE. WHILE PUTATIVE MECHANISMS BEHIND YOGA'S IMPACT ON SUBSTANCE USE HAVE BEEN PROPOSED, THE RESEARCH IS LIMITED. THIS MANUSCRIPT AIMS TO DETERMINE HOW A HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION IMPACTS THE SUBSTANCE USE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE IN REENTRY FROM PRISON OR JAIL (RETURNING CITIZENS), AND LIVING WITH HIV AND SUBSTANCE USE PROBLEMS. DESIGN: SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH 28 RETURNING CITIZENS WHO PARTICIPATED IN A YOGA INTERVENTION. GUIDED BY A QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTIVE METHODOLOGY, THEMATIC ANALYSIS WAS USED TO IDENTIFY THEMES THAT ANSWERED HOW YOGA IMPACTED PARTICIPANT SUBSTANCE USE. SETTING: A COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION IN PHILADELPHIA, PA, USA THAT CONNECTS PEOPLE TO HEALTH SERVICES, PROVIDES EDUCATION AND SUPPORTIVE SERVICES, AND ADVOCATES FOR PEOPLE WITH CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT. INTERVENTION: A 90-MINUTE HATHA YOGA CLASS OFFERED ONCE A WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS. RESULTS: FOURTEEN PARTICIPANTS REPORTED THAT YOGA EITHER REDUCED SUBSTANCE USE OR MAINTAINED NON-USE, VIA THE MECHANISMS OF PURPOSEFUL DISTRACTION, STRESS COPING (BY CULTIVATING MINDFULNESS AND REDUCING PHYSICAL DISCOMFORT), SOCIAL SUPPORT AND CONFIDENCE. ELEVEN PARTICIPANTS REPORTED THAT YOGA DID NOT IMPACT THEIR SUBSTANCE USE. THREE PARTICIPANTS DID NOT DISCUSS IT. CONCLUSIONS: BY PROVIDING PURPOSEFUL DISTRACTION, INCREASED STRESS COPING, SOCIAL SUPPORT AND CONFIDENCE; YOGA MAY REDUCE SUBSTANCE USE AND MAINTAIN ENGAGEMENT IN RECOVERY. THESE MECHANISTIC ACTIONS PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR THEMES TO HIGHLIGHT IN YOGA CLASSES THAT AIM TO IMPACT SUBSTANCE USE AMONG RETURNING CITIZENS LIVING WITH HIV.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
16 2767 19 YOGA PROVISION FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: IS THE FUTURE ONLINE? BACKGROUND: YOGA HAS MULTIPLE BENEFITS FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS), INCLUDING REDUCED PAIN, DEPRESSION, FATIGUE, STRENGTH, AND IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE. DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, HOME-BASED DELIVERY OF YOGA INCREASED. HOWEVER, NO STUDIES TO DATE HAVE EXPLORED ONLINE HOME-BASED YOGA FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MS, MORE SPECIFICALLY THE MOTIVATIONS, EXPERIENCES, OR THE SUSTAINABILITY OF HOME-BASED YOGA PRACTICE FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MS. AIM: THIS STUDY AIMED TO EXPLORE THE FACILITATORS AND BARRIERS OF ONLINE YOGA PROVISION FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MS. METHODS: ONE FOCUS GROUP AND THREE SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE CARRIED OUT ONLINE VIA ZOOM WITH ONE YOGA INSTRUCTOR AND SEVEN YOGA PARTICIPANTS LIVING WITH MS. THEMATIC ANALYSIS WAS USED TO ANALYSE THIS DATA. FINDINGS: TWO THEMES WERE GENERATED FROM THE INTERVIEWS, THE ENVIRONMENT AND FUTURE PROVISION, EACH WITH THEIR OWN SUB-THEMES. THE THEMES REFLECT VARIOUS FACILITATORS AND BARRIERS OF HOME-BASED YOGA PROVISION WHICH DIFFERED DEPENDING UPON THE INDIVIDUALS HOME ENVIRONMENT, SOCIAL CONNECTIONS, PHYSICAL ABILITY, AND CONFIDENCE PRACTISING YOGA. FURTHERMORE, PREFERENCES OF HOME PROVISION FLUCTUATED OVER TIME DEPENDING UPON SYMPTOMS OF MS. CONCLUSIONS: HOME-BASED YOGA PRACTICE IS A VIABLE AND ENJOYABLE OPTION FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH MS. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOGA STUDIOS OFFERING HOME-BASED YOGA PROVISION CONSIDER INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN PREFERENCE, AS WELL AS FLUCTUATIONS IN SYMPTOMS THAT MAY CREATE INEQUITABLE ACCESS TO SERVICES AND MAY PREVENT PARTICIPATION FOR SOME.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
17 1082 20 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SLEEP QUALITY AND DEPRESSION IN ELDERS IN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES. BACKGROUND: BEING RELOCATED TO AN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY CAN RESULT IN SLEEP DISTURBANCES AND DEPRESSION IN ELDERS. THIS MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO OR WORSENED BY LACK OF REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. APPROPRIATE EXERCISE PROGRAMS MAY BE AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF QUALITY OF LIFE IN THIS GROUP OF TRANSITIONAL FRAIL ELDERS. PURPOSE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO TEST THE EFFECTS OF A 6-MONTH YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM IN IMPROVING SLEEP QUALITY AND DECREASING DEPRESSION IN TRANSITIONAL FRAIL ELDERS LIVING IN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES. METHODS: A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL PRETEST-AND-POSTTEST DESIGN WAS USED. A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF 69 ELDERLY RESIDENTS OF ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES WAS DIVIDED RANDOMLY INTO A YOGA EXERCISE (N = 38) AND CONTROL GROUP (N = 31) BASED ON RESIDENCE LOCATION. A TOTAL OF 55 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE STUDY. THE INTERVENTION WAS IMPLEMENTED IN THREE SMALL GROUPS, AND EACH PRACTICE GROUP WAS LED BY TWO PRETRAINED CERTIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTORS THREE TIMES PER WEEK AT 70 MIN PER PRACTICE SESSION FOR 24 WEEKS. THE OUTCOME MEASURES OF SLEEP QUALITY (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX) AND DEPRESSION STATE (TAIWANESE DEPRESSION QUESTIONNAIRE) WERE EXAMINED AT BASELINE, AT THE 12TH WEEK, AND AT THE 24TH WEEK OF THE STUDY. RESULTS: AFTER 6 MONTHS OF PERFORMING YOGA EXERCISES, PARTICIPANTS' OVERALL SLEEP QUALITY HAD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED, WHEREAS DEPRESSION, SLEEP DISTURBANCES, AND DAYTIME DYSFUNCTION HAD DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (P < .05). IN ADDITION, PARTICIPANTS IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP HAD BETTER RESULTS ON ALL OUTCOME INDICATORS THAN THOSE OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOGA EXERCISE BE INCORPORATED AS AN ACTIVITY PROGRAM IN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES OR IN OTHER LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES TO IMPROVE SLEEP QUALITY AND DECREASE DEPRESSION IN INSTITUTIONALIZED ELDERS.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
18 2495 16 YOGA AS PALLIATION IN WOMEN WITH ADVANCED CANCER: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE PALLIATIVE POTENTIAL OF HOME-BASED YOGA SESSIONS PROVIDED TO WOMEN WITH ADVANCED CANCER. METHOD: PERSONALISED 45-MINUTE YOGA SESSIONS WERE OFFERED TO THREE WOMEN WITH ADVANCED CANCER BY AN EXPERIENCED YOGA TEACHER. EACH WOMAN TOOK PART IN A ONE-TO-ONE INTERVIEW AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE YOGA PROGRAMME AND WAS ASKED TO DESCRIBE HER EXPERIENCES OF THE PROGRAMME'S IMPACT. RESULTS: THE PERSONALISED NATURE OF THE YOGA SESSIONS RESULTED IN SIMILAR POSITIVE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL EFFECTS COMPARABLE TO THOSE DEMONSTRATED IN OTHER STUDIES WITH CANCER PATIENTS. PARTICIPANTS DESCRIBED PHYSICAL, MENTAL, AND EMOTIONAL BENEFITS AS WELL AS THE ALLEVIATION OF ILLNESS IMPACTS. THE ENHANCEMENT OF MIND-BODY AND BODY-SPIRIT CONNECTIONS WERE ALSO NOTED. CONCLUSION: PERSONALISED HOME-BASED YOGA PROGRAMMES FOR PEOPLE WITH ADVANCED CANCER MAY PRODUCE SIMILAR BENEFITS, INCLUDING PALLIATION, AS THOSE INSTITUTIONALLY-BASED PROGRAMMES FOR PEOPLE WITH NON-ADVANCED CANCER.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
19 1711 15 PERCEIVED BENEFITS AND BARRIERS TO YOGA PARTICIPATION AFTER STROKE: A FOCUS GROUP APPROACH. BACKGROUND: AND PURPOSE: THERE IS INCREASING EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST YOGA CAN BE BENEFICIAL TO HEALTH AND WELLBEING AFTER STROKE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO IDENTIFY PERCEIVED BENEFITS AND BARRIERS TO YOGA PARTICIPATION AMONG ADULTS WITH CHRONIC STROKE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TWENTY-SIX COMMUNITY DWELLING ADULTS (14 FEMALE, 12 MALE) WHO WERE AT LEAST 6-MONTHS POST-STROKE PARTICIPATED IN FOUR FOCUS GROUPS HELD AT LOCAL STROKE RECOVERY MEETINGS. DATA WAS RECORDED AND TRANSCRIPTS WERE ANALYSED THEMATICALLY. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS IDENTIFIED WHOLE BODY BENEFITS, THE RETURN OF CONNECTION AND FEELING HEALTH IN MIND AS THE PRIMARY BENEFITS OF YOGA. PERCEIVED BARRIERS INCLUDED PHYSICAL BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATION, COGNITIVE CHALLENGES, ENVIRONMENTAL ACCESS, AND FINANCIAL LIMITATIONS. CONCLUSION: STROKE SURVIVORS PERCEIVE YOGA PRACTICE PROVIDES BENEFITS IN 'CONNECTEDNESS'. FUTURE INTERVENTIONS SHOULD RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF YOGA INSTRUCTOR TRAINING, FOCUS ON THE MIND-BODY CONNECTION ASPECTS OF YOGA, AND MODIFYING ACTIVITIES TO SAFELY ACCOMMODATE THE PHYSICAL ABILITIES OF THE PARTICIPANTS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
20 1234 16 FEASIBILITY AND RESULTS OF A CASE STUDY OF YOGA TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING IN PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY. PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS MIXED-METHODS CASE STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER AN 8-WEEK 1:1 YOGA PROGRAM WAS FEASIBLE AND BENEFICIAL TO PEOPLE WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI). METHOD: THIS WAS A MIXED-METHODS CASE STUDY OF ONE-TO-ONE YOGA FOR PEOPLE WITH TBI INCLUDED THREE PEOPLE. WE COMPLETED ASSESSMENTS BEFORE AND AFTER THE 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION AND INCLUDED MEASURES OF BALANCE, BALANCE CONFIDENCE, PAIN, RANGE OF MOTION, STRENGTH AND MOBILITY. QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WERE INCLUDED AT THE POST-ASSESSMENT. WE INCLUDE A PERCENT CHANGE CALCULATION AND SALIENT QUOTES THAT REPRESENT THE PERCEIVED IMPACT OF THE YOGA INTERVENTION. RESULTS: ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE YOGA INTERVENTION AND ALL DEMONSTRATED IMPROVEMENTS IN PHYSICAL OUTCOME MEASURES. FOR THE GROUP, BALANCE INCREASED BY 36%, BALANCE CONFIDENCE BY 39%, LOWER EXTREMITY STRENGTH BY 100% AND ENDURANCE BY 105%. QUALITATIVE DATA SUPPORT THE USE OF YOGA TO IMPROVE MULTIPLE ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING, ONE PARTICIPANT STATED: "I MEAN IT'S ROCKED MY WORLD. IT'S CHANGED MY LIFE. I MEAN ALL THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS. I MEAN PHYSICALLY, EMOTIONALLY, MENTALLY, IT'S GIVEN ME YOU KNOW MY LIFE BACK...". CONCLUSIONS: YOGA, DELIVERED IN A ONE-TO-ONE SETTING, APPEARS TO BE FEASIBLE AND BENEFICIAL TO PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC TBI. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: CHRONIC TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI) LEADS TO MANY ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING IMPAIRMENT. YOGA DELIVERED IN A ONE-TO-ONE SETTING MAY BE FEASIBLE AND BENEFICIAL FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC TBI.	2016

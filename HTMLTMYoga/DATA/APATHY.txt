1 2875 133 YOGA-PLUS EXERCISE MIX PROMOTES COGNITIVE, AFFECTIVE, AND PHYSICAL FUNCTIONS IN ELDERLY PEOPLE. OBJECTIVES: INCREASED ATTENTION IS BEING PAID TO ASIAN MEDICINE IN BALANCED TOTAL HEALTH CARE. WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF MIXED EXERCISE INCLUDING YOGA ('YOGA-PLUS') AMONG ELDERLY INDIVIDUALS. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 385 SUBJECTS (72 MALES AND 313 FEMALES, 75.5 +/- 8.7 YEARS OLD) PARTICIPATED IN A 12-MONTH (M) EXERCISE PROGRAM AT A HEALTH AND WELFARE CENTER, A DAY SERVICE CENTER, AND A NURSING HOME. COGNITIVE, AFFECTIVE, AND PHYSICAL FUNCTIONS, AND ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING (ADL), WERE COMPARED AT BASELINE (0M), 6M AND 12M OF EXERCISE INTERVENTION. RESULTS: MEAN SCORES ON THE FRONTAL ASSESSMENT BATTERY, CLOCK DRAWING TEST, CUBE COPYING TEST, LETTER FLUENCY, AND CATEGORY FLUENCY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED AFTER THE YOGA-PLUS INTERVENTION, WHILE MINI-MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION, HASEGAWA DEMENTIA SCORE-REVISED, AND TRAIL-MAKING TEST PERFORMANCE WERE RELATIVELY STABLE. AFFECTIVE SCORES ON THE GERIATRIC DEPRESSION SCALE (GDS), APATHY SCALE (AS) AND ABE'S BEHAVIORAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS OF DEMENTIA WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY EXERCISE THERAPY, BUT SUBGROUPS WITH HIGHER BASELINE GDS (GDS >/= 5) AND AS (AS >/= 16) SCORES SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT AFTER INTERVENTION. ONE-LEG STANDING TIME AND 3-M TIMED UP AND GO TEST PERFORMANCE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED AFTER 12M INTERVENTION. DISCUSSION: YOGA-PLUS IMPROVED COGNITIVE, AFFECTIVE, ADL, AND PHYSICAL FUNCTIONS IN A LOCAL ELDERLY POPULATION, PARTICULARLY AMONG BELOW-BASELINE INDIVIDUALS, INDICATING THE BENEFITS OF DEMENTIA PREVENTION AMONG ELDERLY INDIVIDUALS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
2  176  35 A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF KUNDALINI YOGA IN MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT. BACKGROUND: GLOBAL POPULATION AGING WILL RESULT IN INCREASING RATES OF COGNITIVE DECLINE AND DEMENTIA. THUS, EFFECTIVE, LOW-COST, AND LOW SIDE-EFFECT INTERVENTIONS FOR THE TREATMENT AND PREVENTION OF COGNITIVE DECLINE ARE URGENTLY NEEDED. OUR STUDY IS THE FIRST TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF KUNDALINI YOGA (KY) TRAINING ON MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT (MCI). METHODS: OLDER PARTICIPANTS (>/=55 YEARS OF AGE) WITH MCI WERE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER A 12-WEEK KY INTERVENTION OR MEMORY ENHANCEMENT TRAINING (MET; GOLD-STANDARD, ACTIVE CONTROL). COGNITIVE (I.E. MEMORY AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING) AND MOOD (I.E. DEPRESSION, APATHY, AND RESILIENCE) ASSESSMENTS WERE ADMINISTERED AT BASELINE, 12 WEEKS AND 24 WEEKS. RESULTS: AT BASELINE, 81 PARTICIPANTS HAD NO SIGNIFICANT BASELINE GROUP DIFFERENCES IN CLINICAL OR DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS. AT 12 WEEKS AND 24 WEEKS, BOTH KY AND MET GROUPS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN MEMORY; HOWEVER, ONLY KY SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING. ONLY THE KY GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND RESILIENCE AT WEEK 12. CONCLUSION: KY GROUP SHOWED SHORT- AND LONG-TERM IMPROVEMENTS IN EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING AS COMPARED TO MET, AND BROADER EFFECTS ON DEPRESSED MOOD AND RESILIENCE. THIS OBSERVATION SHOULD BE CONFIRMED IN FUTURE CLINICAL TRIALS OF YOGA INTERVENTION FOR TREATMENT AND PREVENTION OF COGNITIVE DECLINE (NCT01983930).	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
3 2027  28 TAI CHI AND YOGA FOR IMPROVING BALANCE ON ONE LEG: A NEUROIMAGING AND BIOMECHANICS STUDY. THE ONE-LEG STANCE IS FREQUENTLY USED IN BALANCE TRAINING AND REHABILITATION PROGRAMS FOR VARIOUS BALANCE DISORDERS. THERE ARE SOME TYPICAL ONE-LEG STANCE POSTURES IN TAI CHI (TC) AND YOGA, WHICH ARE NORMALLY USED FOR IMPROVING BALANCE. HOWEVER, THE MECHANISM IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. BESIDES, THE DIFFERENCES OF ONE-LEG STANCE POSTURES BETWEEN TC AND YOGA IN TRAINING BALANCE ARE STILL UNKNOWN. THEREFORE, THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE CORTICAL ACTIVATION AND RAMBLING AND TREMBLING TRAJECTORIES TO ELUCIDATE THE POSSIBLE MECHANISM OF IMPROVING ONE-LEG STANCE BALANCE, AND COMPARE THE POSTURAL DEMANDS DURING ONE-LEG STANCE POSTURES BETWEEN TC AND YOGA. THIRTY-TWO HEALTHY YOUNG INDIVIDUALS WERE RECRUITED TO PERFORM TWO TC ONE-LEG STANCE POSTURES, I.E., RIGHT HEEL KICK (RHK) AND LEFT LOWER BODY AND STAND ON ONE LEG (LSOL), TWO YOGA POSTURES, I.E., ONE-LEG BALANCE AND TREE, AND NORMAL ONE-LEG STANDING (OLS). BRAIN ACTIVATION IN THE PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX, SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA (SMA), AND DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX (DLPFC) WAS MEASURED USING FUNCTIONAL NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY. THE CENTER OF PRESSURE WAS SIMULTANEOUSLY RECORDED USING A FORCE PLATFORM AND DECOMPOSED INTO RAMBLING AND TREMBLING COMPONENTS. ONE-WAY REPEATED-MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE WAS USED FOR THE MAIN EFFECTS. THE RELATIVE CONCENTRATION CHANGES OF OXYGENATED HEMOGLOBIN (DELTAHBO) IN SMA WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER DURING RHK, LSOL, AND TREE THAN THAT DURING OLS (P < 0.001). RHK (P < 0.001), LSOL (P = 0.003), AND TREE (P = 0.006) ALL SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER ROOT MEAN SQUARE RAMBLING (RMRMS) THAN THAT DURING OLS IN THE MEDIAL-LATERAL DIRECTION. THE RIGHT DLPFC ACTIVATION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER DURING THE RHK THAN THAT DURING THE TREE (P = 0.023), OLB (P < 0.001), AND OLS (P = 0.013) POSTURES. IN CONCLUSION, THE RHK, LSOL, AND TREE COULD BE USED AS TRAINING MOVEMENTS FOR PEOPLE WITH IMPAIRED BALANCE. FURTHERMORE, THE RHK IN TC MAY PROVIDE MORE COGNITIVE TRAINING IN POSTURAL CONTROL THAN TREE AND OLB IN YOGA. KNOWLEDGE FROM THIS STUDY COULD BE USED AND IMPLEMENTED IN TRAINING ONE-LEG STANCE BALANCE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
4 1121  33 EFFICACY OF INTEGRATED YOGA AND AYURVEDA RASAYANA ON COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS IN ELDERLY WITH MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT: NON-RANDOMIZED THREE-ARM CLINICAL TRIAL. BACKGROUND: YOGA AND AYURVEDA ARE ANCIENT SCIENCES WHICH EMPHASIZE ON THE CURE OF DISEASE AND THE PROPORTION OF HEALTH. BOTH SCIENCES ARE ALSO KNOWN TO REDUCE THE AGING PROCESS AND ARE HELPFUL IN AGING-RELATED DISORDERS. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND AYURVEDA RASAYANA COMBINED INTERVENTION ON COGNITION AMONG THE ELDERLY WITH MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: SEVENTY-TWO ELDERLY PERSONS (AVERAGE AGE 63.3 +/- 6.44 YEARS) RECEIVED AYURVEDA RASAYANA (AR) (N = 23) OR INTEGRATED YOGA (IY) (N = 25) OR COMBINED (IY PLUS AR) INTERVENTION (N = 24) FOR EIGHT WEEKS. AR TREATMENT CONSISTED OF BRAHMI GHRITA, AND IY CONSISTED OF ASANA, PRANAYAMA, MEDITATION, AND RELAXATION TECHNIQUES. EXECUTIVE FUNCTION, VERBAL FLUENCY, ATTENTION, PROCESSING SPEED, SHORT-TERM AND WORKING MEMORY, AND LEARNING AND VERBAL MEMORY WERE ASSESSED AT THE BASELINE AND AFTER EIGHT WEEKS. RESULTS: WITHIN-GROUP ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT TIME MAIN EFFECT (P < 0.05) IN ALL COGNITIVE MEASURES IN THE THREE GROUPS (IY, AR, AND IY PLUS AR) EXCEPT DIGIT BACKWARD TEST. BONFERRONI POST HOC TEST SHOWS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN PRE TO POST IN ALL VARIABLES. IN THE BETWEEN-GROUP ANALYSIS, THERE WAS A SUBSTANTIAL GROUP DIFFERENCE FOR REY'S AUDITORY VERBAL LEARNING TEST- HITS, F (2,69) = 4.376 (P < 0.016), REY'S AUDITORY VERBAL LEARNING TEST-AVERAGE, F (2,69) = 4.727 (0.012), DIGIT BACKWARD TEST, F (2,69) = 5.766 (0.005) AFTER EIGHT WEEKS OF INTERVENTION. CONCLUSION: BOTH AYURVEDA RASAYANA AND INTEGRATED YOGA INTERVENTION WERE FOUND EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING COGNITIVE ABILITIES AMONG THE ELDERLY WITH MCI. COMBINED AYURVEDA RASAYANA AND YOGA INTERVENTION SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED LEARNING, ATTENTION, PROCESSING SPEED, AND WORKING MEMORY COMPARED TO INDIVIDUAL RESPONSE AMONG ELDERLY PERSONS WITH MCI.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
5 1857  40 RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION IN RESIDENTS FROM ELDERLY HOMES: EFFECTS ON COGNITIVE FUNCTION. CONTEXT: ELDERLY HAVE INCREASED RISK FOR COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT AND DEMENTIA. YOGA THERAPY MAY BE HELPFUL IN ELDERLY TO IMPROVE COGNITIVE FUNCTION. AIMS: WE EXAMINED THE BENEFITS OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION COMPARED WITH WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP ON COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN THE RESIDENTS OF ELDERLY HOMES. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: SINGLE BLIND CONTROLLED STUDY WITH BLOCK RANDOMIZATION OF ELDERLY HOMES. MATERIALS AND METHODS: STUDY SAMPLE INCLUDED YOGA GROUP (N=62) AND WAITLIST GROUP (N=58). A TOTAL OF 87 SUBJECTS (YOGA=44, WAITLIST=43) COMPLETED THE STUDY PERIOD OF 6 MONTHS. YOGA GROUP RECEIVED DAILY YOGA SESSIONS FOR 1 MONTH, WEEKLY UNTIL 3(RD) MONTH AND ENCOURAGED TO CONTINUE UNSUPERVISED UNTIL 6 MONTHS. THEY WERE ASSESSED ON REY'S AUDITORY VERBAL LEARNING TEST (RAVLT), REY'S COMPLEX FIGURE TEST (CFT), WECHSLER'S MEMORY SCALE (WMS)-DIGIT AND SPATIAL SPAN, CONTROLLED ORAL WORD ASSOCIATION (COWA) TEST, STROOP COLOR WORD INTERFERENCE TEST AND TRAIL MAKING TEST A AND B AT BASELINE AND AT THE END OF 6(TH) MONTH. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: PAIRED T-TEST AND ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE (ANCOVA) TO COMPARE THE DIFFERENCE IN NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL TEST SCORES. RESULTS: YOGA GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN IMMEDIATE AND DELAYED RECALL OF VERBAL (RAVLT) AND VISUAL MEMORY (CFT), ATTENTION AND WORKING MEMORY (WMS-SPATIAL SPAN), VERBAL FLUENCY (COWA), EXECUTIVE FUNCTION (STROOP INTERFERENCE) AND PROCESSING SPEED (TRAIL MAKING TEST-A) THAN WAITLIST GROUP AT THE END OF 6 MONTHS AFTER CORRECTING FOR CORRESPONDING BASELINE SCORE AND EDUCATION. CONCLUSION: YOGA BASED-INTERVENTION APPEARS BENEFICIAL TO IMPROVE SEVERAL DOMAINS OF COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN ELDERLY LIVING IN RESIDENTIAL CARE HOMES. STUDY FINDINGS NEED TO BE INTERPRETED AFTER CONSIDERING METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS LIKE LACK OF ACTIVE COMPARISON GROUP.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
6 2325  31 TREATMENT OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER WITH IYENGAR YOGA AND COHERENT BREATHING: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED DOSING STUDY. OBJECTIVES: THE AIMS OF THIS STUDY WERE TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF AN INTERVENTION OF IYENGAR YOGA AND COHERENT BREATHING AT FIVE BREATHS PER MINUTE ON DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND TO DETERMINE OPTIMAL INTERVENTION YOGA DOSING FOR FUTURE STUDIES IN INDIVIDUALS WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD). METHODS: SUBJECTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO THE HIGH-DOSE GROUP (HDG) OR LOW-DOSE GROUP (LDG) FOR A 12-WEEK INTERVENTION OF THREE OR TWO INTERVENTION CLASSES PER WEEK, RESPECTIVELY. ELIGIBLE SUBJECTS WERE 18-64 YEARS OLD WITH MDD, HAD BASELINE BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY-II (BDI-II) SCORES >/=14, AND WERE EITHER ON NO ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATIONS OR ON A STABLE DOSE OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS FOR >/=3 MONTHS. THE INTERVENTION INCLUDED 90-MIN CLASSES PLUS HOMEWORK. OUTCOME MEASURES WERE BDI-II SCORES AND INTERVENTION COMPLIANCE. RESULTS: FIFTEEN HDG (MAGE = 38.4 +/- 15.1 YEARS) AND 15 LDG (MAGE = 34.7 +/- 10.4 YEARS) SUBJECTS COMPLETED THE INTERVENTION. BDI-II SCORES AT SCREENING AND COMPLIANCE DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN GROUPS (P = 0.26). BDI-II SCORES DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM SCREENING (24.6 +/- 1.7) TO WEEK 12 (6.0 +/- 3.8) FOR THE HDG (-18.6 +/- 6.6; P < 0.001), AND FROM SCREENING (27.7 +/- 2.1) TO WEEK 12 (10.1 +/- 7.9) IN THE LDG (-17.7 +/- 9.3; P < 0.001). THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS, BASED ON RESPONSE (I.E., >50% DECREASE IN BDI-II SCORES; P = 0.65) FOR THE HDG (13/15 SUBJECTS) AND LDG (11/15 SUBJECTS) OR REMISSION (I.E., NUMBER OF SUBJECTS WITH BDI-II SCORES <14; P = 1.00) FOR THE HDG (14/15 SUBJECTS) AND LDG (13/15 SUBJECTS) AFTER THE 12-WEEK INTERVENTION, ALTHOUGH A GREATER NUMBER OF SUBJECTS IN THE HDG HAD 12-WEEK BDI-II SCORES </=10 (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: DURING THIS 12-WEEK INTERVENTION OF YOGA PLUS COHERENT BREATHING, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS DECLINED SIGNIFICANTLY IN PATIENTS WITH MDD IN BOTH THE HDG AND LDG.

STUDIES ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS HAVE SHOWN IMPROVEMENT IN MEMORY, VIGILANCE AND ANXIETY LEVELS. 30 PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM MAJOR DEPRESSION (AGE 18 TO 45 YEARS) WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: GROUP 1: (10 MALES AND 5 FEMALES) PATIENTS WHO PRACTISED SAHAJ YOGA MEDITATION AND ALSO RECEIVED CONVENTIONAL ANTI-DEPRESSANT MEDICATION. GROUP 2: (9 MALES AND 6 FEMALES) PATIENTS WHO ONLY RECEIVED CONVENTIONAL ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATION. GROUP 1 PATIENTS WERE ADMINISTERED SAHAJ YOGA PRACTICE FOR 8 WEEKS. NEURO-COGNITIVE TEST BATTERY CONSISTING OF LETTER CANCELLATION TEST (LCT), TRAIL MAKING TEST 'A' (TTA), TRAIL MAKING TEST 'B' (TTB), RUFF FIGURAL FLUENCY TEST (RFFT), FORWARD DIGIT SPAN (FDS) & REVERSE DIGIT SPAN TEST (RDS) WAS USED TO ASSESS FOLLOWING COGNITIVE DOMAINS: ATTENTION SPAN, VISUO-MOTOR SPEED, SHORT-TERM MEMORY, WORKING MEMORY AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS. AFTER 8 WEEKS, BOTH GROUP 1 AND GROUP 2 SUBJECTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN LCT, TTA & TTB BUT IMPROVEMENT IN LCT WAS MORE MARKED IN GROUP 1 SUBJECTS. ALSO, THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN RDS SCORES IN ONLY GROUP 1 SUBJECTS (P < 0.05). THE RESULTS THEREBY, DEMONSTRATE THAT SAHAJ YOGA PRACTICE IN ADDITION TO THE IMPROVEMENT IN VARIOUS OTHER COGNITIVE DOMAINS SEEN WITH CONVENTIONAL ANTI-DEPRESSANTS, CAN LEAD TO ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENT IN EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS LIKE MANIPULATION OF INFORMATION IN THE VERBAL WORKING MEMORY AND ADDED IMPROVEMENT IN ATTENTION SPAN AND VISUO-MOTOR SPEED OF THE DEPRESSIVES.	2006	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
8  866  30 EFFECT OF YOGA PROGRAM ON EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS OF ADOLESCENTS DWELLING IN AN ORPHAN HOME: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. EXECUTIVE FUNCTION (EF) IS IMPORTANT FOR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OF CHILDREN. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT CHILDREN WITH POVERTY AND EARLY LIFE STRESS HAVE REDUCED EF. THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA PROGRAM ON THE EF OF ORPHAN ADOLESCENTS. SEVENTY TWO APPARENTLY HEALTHY ORPHAN ADOLESCENTS RANDOMIZED AND ALLOCATED INTO TWO GROUPS AS YOGA GROUP (N = 40; 14 GIRLS, AGE = 12.69 +/- 1.35 YRS) AND WAIT LIST CONTROL (WLC) GROUP (N = 32, 13 GIRLS, AGE = 12.58 +/- 1.52 YRS). YOGA GROUP UNDERWENT THREE MONTHS OF YOGA PROGRAM IN A SCHEDULE OF 90 MIN PER DAY, FOUR DAYS PER WEEK WHEREAS THE WLC GROUP FOLLOWED THE ROUTINE ACTIVITIES. THEY WERE ASSESSED BY STROOP COLOR-WORD TASK, DIGIT SYMBOL SUBSTITUTION TEST (DSST), DIGITS SPAN TEST AND TRIAL MAKING TEST (TMT) AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE PROGRAM. THE REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN TIME AND GROUP INTERACTIONS (P < 0.05) FOR ALL SUBTESTS OF STROOP COLOR-WORD TASK AND DIGIT SPAN TEST AND PART-A OF TMT WHEREAS THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE FOUND IN DSST AND TMT (PART-B). THE POST-HOC TEST WITH BONFERRONI ADJUSTMENT ALSO SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS (P < 0.001) WITHIN THE YOGA GROUP IN ALL TEST SCORES WHILE IN WRONG SCORE OF DSST DID NOT EXHIBIT SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION. WHEREAS THE WLC GROUP, SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT (P < 0.05) IN STROOP COLOR, COLOR-WORD SCORE, NET SCORE OF DSST, DIGIT SPAN FORWARD AND DIGIT SPAN TOTAL. THREE MONTHS YOGA PROGRAM WAS FOUND USEFUL FOR THE YOUNG ORPHAN ADOLESCENTS IN IMPROVING THEIR EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
9  455  28 CHANGES IN NEURAL CONNECTIVITY AND MEMORY FOLLOWING A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR OLDER ADULTS: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: NO STUDY HAS EXPLORED THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON COGNITIVE DECLINE AND RESTING-STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY. OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY EXPLORED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PERFORMANCE ON MEMORY TESTS AND RESTING-STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY BEFORE AND AFTER A YOGA INTERVENTION VERSUS ACTIVE CONTROL FOR SUBJECTS WITH MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT (MCI). METHODS: PARTICIPANTS ( >/= 55 Y) WITH MCI WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE A YOGA INTERVENTION OR ACTIVE "GOLD-STANDARD" CONTROL (I.E., MEMORY ENHANCEMENT TRAINING (MET)) FOR 12 WEEKS. RESTING-STATE FUNCTIONAL MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING WAS USED TO MAP CORRELATIONS BETWEEN BRAIN NETWORKS AND MEMORY PERFORMANCE CHANGES OVER TIME. DEFAULT MODE NETWORKS (DMN), LANGUAGE AND SUPERIOR PARIETAL NETWORKS WERE CHOSEN AS NETWORKS OF INTEREST TO ANALYZE THE ASSOCIATION WITH CHANGES IN VERBAL AND VISUOSPATIAL MEMORY PERFORMANCE. RESULTS: FOURTEEN YOGA AND 11 MET PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE STUDY. THE YOGA GROUP DEMONSTRATED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN DEPRESSION AND VISUOSPATIAL MEMORY. WE OBSERVED IMPROVED VERBAL MEMORY PERFORMANCE CORRELATED WITH INCREASED CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN THE DMN AND FRONTAL MEDIAL CORTEX, PREGENUAL ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX, RIGHT MIDDLE FRONTAL CORTEX, POSTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX, AND LEFT LATERAL OCCIPITAL CORTEX. IMPROVED VERBAL MEMORY PERFORMANCE POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH INCREASED CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN THE LANGUAGE PROCESSING NETWORK AND THE LEFT INFERIOR FRONTAL GYRUS. IMPROVED VISUOSPATIAL MEMORY PERFORMANCE CORRELATED INVERSELY WITH CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN THE SUPERIOR PARIETAL NETWORK AND THE MEDIAL PARIETAL CORTEX. CONCLUSION: YOGA MAY BE AS EFFECTIVE AS MET IN IMPROVING FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY IN RELATION TO VERBAL MEMORY PERFORMANCE. THESE FINDINGS SHOULD BE CONFIRMED IN LARGER PROSPECTIVE STUDIES.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
10  681  39 EFFECT OF ADD-ON YOGA ON COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS AMONG SUBSTANCE ABUSERS IN A RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC CENTER: RANDOMIZED COMPARATIVE STUDY. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC VULNERABILITY CHARACTERIZES SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDER WITH CONSEQUENT RELAPSE. THE PROCESS OF ABSTINENCE DEPENDS ON COGNITIVE RECOVERY. HENCE, BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTION SHOULD ACCOUNT FOR COGNITIVE DIMENSION OF SUBSTANCE ABUSERS. RECENT STUDIES HIGHLIGHT YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION AS A PROMISING ADD-ON THERAPY FOR TREATING AND PREVENTING ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS. PURPOSE: THE STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF A YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION AS AN ADD-ON IN ENHANCING COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS, COMPARED WITH PHYSICAL EXERCISE TO NEWLY ADMITTED SUBSTANCE ABUSERS SEEKING AN INPATIENT TREATMENT PROGRAM. METHODS: THE STUDY WAS A SINGLE-BLIND, RANDOMIZED, COMPARATIVE DESIGN THAT INCLUDED 96 MALE PARTICIPANTS, BETWEEN 18 AND 40 YEARS IN A RESIDENTIAL REHABILITATION TREATMENT UNIT. PARTAKERS IN THE YOGA OR PHYSICAL EXERCISE GROUP RECEIVED SUPERVISED DAILY TRAINING FOR 12 WEEKS, IN ADDITION TO STANDARD REHABILITATION TREATMENT. RATERS BLIND TO THE STUDY ASSESSED THE PATIENTS ON DIGIT SPAN TASK, CANCELLATION TEST, AND STROOP TESTS AT THE BASELINE AND FOLLOWING 12 WEEKS OF INTERVENTION. RESULTS: A SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENT IN DIGIT FORWARD (YOGA - P < 0.0005, D = 0.81; EXERCISE - P < 0.0005, D = 0.73), DIGIT BACKWARD (YOGA - P < 0.0005, D = 0.88; EXERCISE - P < 0.0005, D = 0.58), AND LETTER CANCELLATION TEST SCORES (YOGA - P < 0.0005, D = 1.31; EXERCISE - P < 0.0005, D = 1.4) WERE OBSERVED IN BOTH THE YOGA AND THE EXERCISE GROUPS. STROOP WORD AND COLOR TASK SCORES WERE SEEN SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER FOLLOWING YOGA (P < 0.005, D = 0.74; P < 0.005, D = 1.13) AND EXERCISE (P < 0.0005, D = 0.62; P < 0.0005, D = 0.61). FURTHERMORE, STROOP COLOR-WORD TEST SHOWED SIGNIFICANT ENHANCEMENT AFTER YOGA (P < 0.0005, D = 1.10) AND EXERCISE (P < 0.0005, D = 0.42), WITH DEGREE OF VARIATION HIGHER IN THE YOGA GROUP. CONCLUSION: OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE ADD-ON YOGA OR EXERCISE-BASED INTERVENTION SHOW ENHANCEMENT OF COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS. THESE FINDINGS PROVIDE THE UTILITY OF YOGA AND EXERCISE-BASED INTERVENTION IN IMPROVING COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS AMONG SUBSTANCE ABUSERS. FURTHERMORE, RIGOROUS TRIALS ARE NEEDED TO EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF THESE PROCEDURES.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
11  817  31 EFFECT OF YOGA ON COGNITIVE ABILITIES IN SCHOOLCHILDREN FROM A SOCIOECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUND: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF YOGA, COMPARED TO PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ON THE COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE IN 7-9 YEAR-OLD SCHOOLCHILDREN FROM A SOCIOECONOMIC DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUND. DESIGN: TWO HUNDRED (200) SCHOOLCHILDREN FROM BANGALORE, INDIA, AFTER BASELINE ASSESSMENT OF COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO EITHER A YOGA OR A PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY GROUP. COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS (ATTENTION AND CONCENTRATION, VISUO-SPATIAL ABILITIES, VERBAL ABILITY, AND ABSTRACT THINKING) WERE ASSESSED USING AN INDIAN ADAPTATION OF THE WECHSLER INTELLIGENCE SCALE FOR CHILDREN AT BASELINE, AFTER 3 MONTHS OF INTERVENTION, AND LATER AT A 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: OF THE 200 SUBJECTS, 193 WERE ASSESSED AT 3 MONTHS AFTER THE STUDY, AND THEN 180 WERE ASSESSED AT THE 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE BETWEEN THE TWO STUDY GROUPS (YOGA VERSUS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY) AT POSTINTERVENTION, AFTER CONTROLLING FOR GRADE LEVELS. IMPROVEMENT IN THE MEAN SCORES OF COGNITIVE TESTS FOLLOWING INTERVENTION VARIED FROM 0.5 (ARITHMETIC) TO 1.4 (CODING) FOR THE YOGA GROUP AND 0.7 (ARITHMETIC) TO 1.6 (VOCABULARY) IN THE PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA WAS AS EFFECTIVE AS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN IMPROVING COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE IN 7-9 YEAR OLD SCHOOLCHILDREN. FURTHER STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO EXAMINE THE DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOGA AND COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
12 1559  20 LONG-TERM VIHANGAM YOGA MEDITATION AND SCORES ON TESTS OF ATTENTION. ALTHOUGH THE LITERATURE INDICATES THAT MEDITATION HAS BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON SEVERAL ASPECTS OF HUMAN FUNCTIONING, FEW STUDIES HAVE SPECIFICALLY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF MEDITATION ON VARIOUS DOMAINS OF ATTENTION. THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO EXAMINE THE DIFFERENCES IN VARIOUS DOMAINS OF ATTENTION BETWEEN LONG-TERM CONCENTRATIVE MEDITATORS VERSUS MATCHED CONTROLS. 15 PRACTITIONERS OF VIHANGAM YOGA (> 10 YR. EXPERIENCE) WERE ENROLLED IN THE STUDY. CONTROLS MATCHED ON AGE, SEX, AND YEARS OF EDUCATION WERE RECRUITED. BOTH GROUPS WERE ADMINISTERED THE STROOP, TRAIL-MAKING, AND DIGIT SYMBOL SUBSTITUTION TESTS AS WELL AS THE DIGIT FORWARD AND DIGIT BACKWARD TESTS. THE GROUP OF VIHANGAM YOGIS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER MEAN PERFORMANCE ON ALL TESTS OF ATTENTION. LONG-TERM VIHANGAM YOGA MEDITATION IMPROVES ATTENTION SPAN, PROCESSING SPEED, ATTENTION ALTERNATION ABILITY, AND PERFORMANCE IN INTERFERENCE TESTS.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
13  535  25 COMPARISON OF YOGA VERSUS PHYSICAL EXERCISE ON EXECUTIVE FUNCTION, ATTENTION, AND WORKING MEMORY IN ADOLESCENT SCHOOLCHILDREN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. PURPOSE: EXECUTIVE FUNCTION, ATTENTION, AND MEMORY ARE AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF COGNITIVE HEALTH IN CHILDREN. IN THIS STUDY, WE ANALYZE THE EFFECT OF YOGA AND PHYSICAL EXERCISE ON EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING, ATTENTION, AND MEMORY. METHODS: IN THIS PROSPECTIVE TWO-ARMED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, AROUND 802 STUDENTS FROM TEN SCHOOLS ACROSS FOUR DISTRICTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE DAILY 1 H YOGA TRAINING (N = 411) OR PHYSICAL EXERCISE (N = 391) FOR 2 MONTHS. EXECUTIVE FUNCTION, ATTENTION, AND MEMORY WERE STUDIED USING TRAIL MAKING TEST (TMT). YOGA (N = 377) AND PHYSICAL EXERCISE (N = 371) STUDENTS CONTRIBUTED DATA TO THE ANALYSES. THE DATA WERE ANALYZED USING INTENTION-TO-TREAT APPROACH USING STUDENT'S T-TEST. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN NUMERICAL TMT (TMTN) VALUES WITHIN YOGA (T = -2.17; P < 0.03) AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (PA) (T = -3.37; P < 0.001) GROUPS FOLLOWING INTERVENTIONAL PERIOD. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN TMTN BETWEEN YOGA AND PA GROUPS (T = 0.44; P = 0.66). THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN ALPHABETICAL TMT (TMTA) VALUES WITHIN YOGA (T = 6.21; P < 0.00) AND PA GROUPS (T = 1.19; P < 0.234) FOLLOWING INTERVENTIONAL PERIOD. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN TMTA BETWEEN YOGA AND PA GROUPS (T = 3.46; P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA IMPROVES EXECUTIVE FUNCTION, ATTENTION, AND WORKING MEMORY AS EFFECTIVELY AS PHYSICAL EXERCISE INTERVENTION IN ADOLESCENT SCHOOLCHILDREN.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
14 1544  32 KUNDALINI YOGA MEDITATION VERSUS THE RELAXATION RESPONSE MEDITATION FOR TREATING ADULTS WITH OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER: A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. BACKGROUND: OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER (OCD) IS OFTEN A LIFE-LONG DISORDER WITH HIGH PSYCHOSOCIAL IMPAIRMENT. SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITORS (SRIS) ARE THE ONLY FDA APPROVED DRUGS, AND APPROXIMATELY 50% OF PATIENTS ARE NON-RESPONDERS WHEN USING A CRITERION OF 25% TO 35% IMPROVEMENT WITH THE YALE-BROWN OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE SCALE (Y-BOCS). ABOUT 30% ARE NON-RESPONDERS TO COMBINED FIRST-LINE THERAPIES (SRIS AND EXPOSURE AND RESPONSE PREVENTION). PREVIOUS RESEARCH (ONE OPEN, ONE RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL) HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT KUNDALINI YOGA (KY) MEDITATION CAN LEAD TO AN IMPROVEMENT IN SYMPTOMS OF OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE SEVERITY. WE EXPAND HERE WITH A LARGER TRIAL. DESIGN: THIS TRIAL COMPARED TWO PARALLEL RUN GROUPS [KY VS. RELAXATION RESPONSE MEDITATION (RR)]. PATIENTS WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED BASED ON GENDER AND Y-BOCS SCORES. THEY WERE TOLD TWO DIFFERENT (UNNAMED) TYPES OF MEDITATION WOULD BE COMPARED, AND INFORMED IF ONE SHOWED GREATER BENEFITS, THE GROUPS WOULD MERGE FOR 12 MONTHS USING THE MORE EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION. RATERS WERE BLIND IN PHASE ONE (0-4.5 MONTHS) TO PATIENT ASSIGNMENTS, BUT NOT IN PHASE TWO. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: PRIMARY OUTCOME VARIABLE, CLINICIAN-ADMINISTERED Y-BOCS. SECONDARY SCALES: DIMENSIONAL YALE-BROWN OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE SCALE (CLINICIAN-ADMINISTERED), PROFILE OF MOOD SCALES, BECK ANXIETY INVENTORY, BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY, CLINICAL GLOBAL IMPRESSION, SHORT FORM 36 HEALTH SURVEY. RESULTS: PHASE ONE: BASELINE Y-BOCS SCORES: KY MEAN = 26.46 (SD 5.124; N = 24), RR MEAN = 26.79 (SD = 4.578; N = 24). AN INTENT-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS WITH THE LAST OBSERVATION CARRIED FORWARD FOR DROPOUTS SHOWED STATISTICALLY GREATER IMPROVEMENT WITH KY COMPARED TO RR ON THE Y-BOCS, AND STATISTICALLY GREATER IMPROVEMENT ON FIVE OF SIX SECONDARY MEASURES. FOR COMPLETERS, THE Y-BOCS SHOWED 40.4% IMPROVEMENT FOR KY (N = 16), 17.9% FOR RR (N = 11); 31.3% IN KY WERE JUDGED TO BE IN REMISSION COMPARED TO 9.1% IN RR. KY COMPLETERS SHOWED GREATER IMPROVEMENT ON FIVE OF SIX SECONDARY MEASURES. AT THE END OF PHASE TWO (12 MONTHS), PATIENTS, DRAWN FROM THE INITIAL GROUPS, WHO ELECTED TO RECEIVE KY CONTINUED TO SHOW IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR Y-BOCS SCORES. CONCLUSION: KY SHOWS PROMISE AS AN ADD-ON OPTION FOR OCD PATIENTS UNRESPONSIVE TO FIRST LINE THERAPIES. FUTURE STUDIES WILL ESTABLISH KY'S RELATIVE EFFICACY COMPARED TO EXPOSURE AND RESPONSE PREVENTION AND/OR MEDICATIONS, AND THE MOST EFFECTIVE TREATMENT SCHEDULE.

15 2382  27 YOCAS(C)(R) YOGA REDUCES SELF-REPORTED MEMORY DIFFICULTY IN CANCER SURVIVORS IN A NATIONWIDE RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL: INVESTIGATING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MEMORY AND SLEEP. UNLABELLED: BACKGROUND INTERVENTIONS ARE NEEDED TO ALLEVIATE MEMORY DIFFICULTY IN CANCER SURVIVORS. WE PREVIOUSLY SHOWED IN A PHASE III RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL THAT YOCAS(C)(R) YOGA-A PROGRAM THAT CONSISTS OF BREATHING EXERCISES, POSTURES, AND MEDITATION-SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED SLEEP QUALITY IN CANCER SURVIVORS. THIS STUDY ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF YOCAS(C)(R) ON MEMORY AND IDENTIFIED RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MEMORY AND SLEEP. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: SURVIVORS WERE RANDOMIZED TO STANDARD CARE (SC) OR SC WITH YOCAS(C)(R) . 328 PARTICIPANTS WHO PROVIDED DATA ON THE MEMORY DIFFICULTY ITEM OF THE MD ANDERSON SYMPTOM INVENTORY ARE INCLUDED. SLEEP QUALITY WAS MEASURED USING THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX. GENERAL LINEAR MODELING (GLM) DETERMINED THE GROUP EFFECT OF YOCAS(C)(R) ON MEMORY DIFFICULTY COMPARED WITH SC. GLM ALSO DETERMINED MODERATION OF BASELINE MEMORY DIFFICULTY ON POSTINTERVENTION SLEEP AND VICE VERSA. PATH MODELING ASSESSED THE MEDIATING EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN MEMORY DIFFICULTY ON YOCAS(C)(R) CHANGES IN SLEEP AND VICE VERSA. RESULTS: YOCAS(C)(R) SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED MEMORY DIFFICULTY AT POSTINTERVENTION COMPARED WITH SC (MEAN CHANGE: YOGA=-0.60; SC=-0.16; P<.05). BASELINE MEMORY DIFFICULTY DID NOT MODERATE THE EFFECTS OF POSTINTERVENTION SLEEP QUALITY IN YOCAS(C)(R) COMPARED WITH SC. BASELINE SLEEP QUALITY DID MODERATE THE EFFECTS OF POSTINTERVENTION MEMORY DIFFICULTY IN YOCAS(C)(R) COMPARED WITH SC (P<.05). CHANGES IN SLEEP QUALITY WAS A SIGNIFICANT MEDIATOR OF REDUCED MEMORY DIFFICULTY IN YOCAS(C)(R) COMPARED WITH SC (P<.05); HOWEVER, CHANGES IN MEMORY DIFFICULTY DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY MEDIATE IMPROVED SLEEP QUALITY IN YOCAS(C)(R) COMPARED WITH SC. CONCLUSIONS: IN THIS LARGE NATIONWIDE TRIAL, YOCAS(C)(R) YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED PATIENT-REPORTED MEMORY DIFFICULTY IN CANCER SURVIVORS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
16 2761  33 YOGA PREVENTS GRAY MATTER ATROPHY IN WOMEN AT RISK FOR ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: FEMALE SEX, SUBJECTIVE COGNITIVE DECLINE (SCD), AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS (CVRFS) ARE KNOWN RISK FACTORS FOR DEVELOPING ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD). WE PREVIOUSLY DEMONSTRATED THAT YOGA IMPROVED DEPRESSION, RESILIENCE, MEMORY AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS, INCREASED HIPPOCAMPAL CHOLINE CONCENTRATIONS, AND MODULATED BRAIN CONNECTIVITY IN OLDER ADULTS WITH MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT. OBJECTIVE: IN THIS STUDY (NCT03503669), WE INVESTIGATED BRAIN GRAY MATTER VOLUME (GMV) CHANGES IN OLDER WOMEN WITH SCD AND CVRFS FOLLOWING THREE MONTHS OF YOGA COMPARED TO MEMORY ENHANCEMENT TRAINING (MET). METHODS: ELEVEN WOMEN (MEAN AGE = 61.45, SD = 6.58) WITH CVRF AND SCD COMPLETED TWELVE WEEKS OF KUNDALINI YOGA AND KIRTAN KRIYA (KY + KK) WHILE ELEVEN WOMEN (MEAN AGE = 64.55, SD = 6.41) UNDERWENT MET. ANXIETY, RESILIENCE, STRESS, AND DEPRESSION WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND 12 WEEKS, AS WERE T1-WEIGHTED MRI SCANS (SIEMENS 3T PRISMA SCANNER). WE USED FREESURFER 6.0 AND TESTED GROUP DIFFERENCES IN GMV CHANGE, APPLYING MONTE-CARLO SIMULATIONS WITH ALPHA = 0.05. REGION-OF-INTEREST ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED FOR HIPPOCAMPUS AND AMYGDALA. RESULTS: COMPARED TO KY + KK, MET SHOWED REDUCTIONS IN GMV IN LEFT PREFRONTAL, PRE- AND POST-CENTRAL, SUPRAMARGINAL, SUPERIOR TEMPORAL AND PERICALCARINE CORTICES, RIGHT PARACENTRAL, POSTCENTRAL, SUPERIOR AND INFERIOR PARIETAL CORTICES, THE BANKS OF THE SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS, AND THE PARS OPERCULARIS. RIGHT HIPPOCAMPAL VOLUME INCREASED AFTER YOGA BUT DID NOT SURVIVE CORRECTIONS. CONCLUSION: YOGA TRAINING MAY OFFER NEUROPROTECTIVE EFFECTS COMPARED TO MET IN PREVENTING NEURODEGENERATIVE CHANGES AND COGNITIVE DECLINE, EVEN OVER SHORT TIME INTERVALS. FUTURE ANALYSES WILL ADDRESS CHANGES IN FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY IN BOTH GROUPS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
17 1454  33 INFLUENCE OF SPORTS CLIMBING AND YOGA ON SPASTICITY, COGNITIVE FUNCTION, MOOD AND FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. OBJECTIVES: SPASTICITY, COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, DEPRESSION AND FATIGUE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) PATIENTS. TO FIND OUT WHETHER NONPHARMALOGICAL TREATMENT APPROACHES CAN REDUCE THESE SYMPTOMS WE INVESTIGATED EFFECTS OF SPORTS CLIMBING (SC) AND YOGA ON SPASTICITY, COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, MOOD CHANGE AND FATIGUE IN MS PATIENTS. SPORTS CLIMBING (SC) AND YOGA ARE AEROBIC PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES COMPRISED A SERIES OF STRETCHING TECHNIQUES, IMPLEMENTATION OF WHICH DEMANDS BODY CONTROL AND PLANNING OF COMPLEX MOVEMENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 20 SUBJECTS WITH RELAPSING-REMITTING OR PROGRESSIVE MS, 26-50 YEARS OF AGE, WITH EDSS<OR=6 AND EDSS PYRAMIDAL FUNCTIONS SCORE (EDSSPYR)>2 WERE ENROLLED IN A RANDOMIZED PROSPECTIVE STUDY. THE PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO SC AND YOGA GROUP. WE EVALUATED SPASTICITY, COGNITIVE FUNCTION, MOOD AND FATIGUE BEFORE AND AFTER BOTH PROGRAMS, THAT LASTED 10 WEEKS, WITH STANDARDIZED ASSESSMENT METHODS. RESULTS: THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN SPASTICITY AFTER SC AND YOGA. IN THE SC GROUP WE FOUND A 25% REDUCTION (P=0.046) IN EDSSPYR. THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES IN EXECUTIVE FUNCTION AFTER THE COMPLETION OF BOTH PROGRAMS. THERE WAS A 17% INCREASE IN SELECTIVE ATTENTION PERFORMANCE AFTER YOGA (P=0.005). SC REDUCED FATIGUE FOR 32.5% (P=0.015), WHILE YOGA HAD NO EFFECT. WE FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT OF SC AND YOGA ON MOOD. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA AND SC MIGHT IMPROVE SOME OF THE MS SYMPTOMS AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE FUTURE AS POSSIBLE COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENTS.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
18 1231  44 FEASIBILITY AND PILOT EFFICACY TESTING OF INTEGRATED YOGA AND SHIRODHARA (AYURVEDIC OIL-DRIPPING) INTERVENTION ON CLINICAL SYMPTOMS, COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS AND SLEEP QUALITY OF ADULTS WITH ANXIETY DISORDER. BACKGROUND: BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY IN ANXIETY DISORDERS (ADS) ARE KNOWN. TRADITIONAL TEXTS DESCRIBE USEFULNESS OF AYURVEDIC OIL-DRIPPING, SHIRODHARA TECHNIQUE, IN RELIEVING ANXIETY. THUS, PRESENT STUDY WAS PLANNED TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY AND SYNERGISTIC VALUE OF SHIRODHARA AS AN ADD-ON TO YOGA THERAPY IN ADULTS WITH AD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIRTY ADULTS (MALES = 14, FEMALES = 16) ADMITTED IN A RESIDENTIAL HOLISTIC HEALTH CARE CENTER WITH AN AGE RANGE OF 29.66 +/- 6.63 YEARS AND DIAGNOSIS OF ONE OF THE ADS (GENERALIZED AD, N = 18; SOCIAL PHOBIA, N = 8; AND PANIC AD, N = 4) AS PER MINI-INTERNATIONAL NEUROPSYCHIATRIC INTERVIEW (M. I. N. I. ENGLISH VERSION 5.0) BY A PSYCHIATRIST WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: (1) INTEGRATED YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE PROGRAM (YT; N = 15) AND (2) YT + AYURVEDA (YA; N = 15). BOTH GROUPS CONTINUED TO RECEIVE CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT AND WERE ON STABLE MEDICATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STUDY PERIOD EXCEPT IN CASES OF EMERGENCY. ASSESSMENTS WERE DONE BY AN INDEPENDENT ASSESSOR AT BASELINE AND AFTER 2 WEEKS OF INTERVENTION FOR CLINICAL SYMPTOMS (HAM-A, STATE AND TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY, AND BRIEF PSYCHIATRIC RATING SCALE), SLEEP QUALITY (SLEEP RATING QUESTIONNAIRE), AND COGNITION (STROOP TEST AND DIGIT LETTER SUBSTITUTION TEST) USING STANDARD VALIDATED TOOLS. PARAMETRIC TESTS WERE APPLIED USING SPSS 10.0 TO ANALYZE THE DATA. RESULTS: TWELVE SUBJECTS IN YOGA GROUP AND THIRTEEN SUBJECTS IN YA GROUP COMPLETED THE TRIAL. NO SIDE EFFECTS WERE REPORTED IN ANY OF THE GROUPS. WITHIN-GROUP COMPARISONS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN CLINICAL SYMPTOMS, COGNITION AND SLEEP QUALITY IN BOTH THE GROUPS. BETWEEN-GROUP COMPARISONS SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER SCORES IN STROOP WORD TASK FOR YA GROUP AS COMPARED TO YT GROUP. FURTHERMORE, THERE WAS A TREND TOWARD BETTER IMPROVEMENT IN SLEEP QUALITY FOR YA GROUP. CONCLUSION: ADDING OF SHIRODHARA TECHNIQUE TO YT WAS FEASIBLE AND MAY BE USEFUL IN IMPROVING EXECUTIVE MEMORY AND SLEEP QUALITY IN ADULTS WITH ADS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
19  858  40 EFFECT OF YOGA OR PHYSICAL EXERCISE ON PHYSICAL, COGNITIVE AND EMOTIONAL MEASURES IN CHILDREN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SEPARATELY REPORTED THE EFFECTS OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE AND YOGA IN CHILDREN, SHOWING PHYSICAL, COGNITIVE AND EMOTIONAL BENEFITS. OBJECTIVES: THE PRESENT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA OR PHYSICAL EXERCISE ON PHYSICAL FITNESS, COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE, SELF-ESTEEM, AND TEACHER-RATED BEHAVIOR AND PERFORMANCE, IN SCHOOL CHILDREN. METHODS: 98 SCHOOL CHILDREN BETWEEN 8 TO 13 YEARS WERE RANDOMIZED AS YOGA AND PHYSICAL EXERCISE GROUPS {N = 49 EACH; (YOGA: 15 GIRLS, GROUP MEAN AGE 10.4 +/- 1.2 YEARS), (PHYSICAL EXERCISE: 23 GIRLS, GROUP MEAN AGE 10.5 +/- 1.3 YEARS)}. BOTH GROUPS WERE BLIND ASSESSED AFTER ALLOCATION, USING: (I) THE EUROFIT PHYSICAL FITNESS TEST BATTERY, (II) STROOP COLOR-WORD TASK FOR CHILDREN, (III) BATTLE'S SELF-ESTEEM INVENTORY AND (IV) THE TEACHERS' RATING OF THE CHILDREN'S OBEDIENCE, ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE, ATTENTION, PUNCTUALITY, AND BEHAVIOR WITH FRIENDS AND TEACHERS. AFTER ASSESSMENTS THE YOGA GROUP PRACTICED YOGA (BREATHING TECHNIQUES, POSTURES, GUIDED RELAXATION AND CHANTING), 45 MINUTES EACH DAY, 5 DAYS A WEEK. DURING THIS TIME THE PHYSICAL EXERCISE GROUP HAD JOGGING-IN-PLACE, RAPID REPETITIVE MOVEMENTS AND RELAY RACES OR GAMES. BOTH GROUPS WERE ASSESSED AT THE END OF 3 MONTHS. DATA WERE ANALYZED WITH RM ANOVA AND POST-HOC TESTS WERE BONFERRONI ADJUSTED. RESULTS: THERE WAS ONE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS. THIS WAS IN SOCIAL SELF-ESTEEM WHICH WAS HIGHER AFTER PHYSICAL EXERCISE COMPARED TO YOGA (P < 0.05). ALL THE CHANGES REPORTED BELOW ARE BASED ON AFTER-BEFORE COMPARISONS, WITHIN EACH GROUP. BOTH GROUPS SHOWED AN INCREASE IN BMI, AND NUMBER OF SIT-UPS (P < 0.001). BALANCE WORSENED IN THE PHYSICAL EXERCISE GROUP, WHILE PLATE TAPPING IMPROVED IN THE YOGA GROUP (P < 0.001). IN THE STROOP TASK BOTH GROUPS SHOWED IMPROVED COLOR, WORD- AND COLOR-WORD NAMING (P < 0.01), WHILE THE PHYSICAL EXERCISE GROUP SHOWED HIGHER INTERFERENCE SCORES. TOTAL, GENERAL AND PARENTAL SELF-ESTEEM IMPROVED IN THE YOGA GROUP (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: YOGA AND PHYSICAL EXERCISE ARE USEFUL ADDITIONS TO THE SCHOOL ROUTINE, WITH PHYSICAL EXERCISE IMPROVING SOCIAL SELF-ESTEEM. TRIAL REGISTRATION: THE STUDY WAS REGISTERED IN THE CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRY OF INDIA (CTRI/2012/11/003112).	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
20 1241  31 FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS A POTENTIALLY LOW RISK INTERVENTION FOR COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT THAT COMBINES MENTAL AND PHYSICAL PRACTICE AND INCLUDES INSTRUCTION ON BREATHING, STRESS REDUCTION, AND MINDFULNESS MEDITATION. PREVIOUS RESEARCH DOCUMENTS THAT YOGA CAN TARGET MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS FOR MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT (MCI) PROGRESSION. THE AUTHORS DESCRIBE A RANDOMIZED FEASIBILITY TRIAL OF YOGA FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH MCI. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE 37 INDIVIDUALS WITH AMNESTIC MCI WHO WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO RECEIVE 12 WEEKS OF TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA INTERVENTION (YI) OR HEALTHY LIVING EDUCATION (HLE) CLASSES. ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY WERE ASSESSED BY TRACKING ADVERSE EVENTS, CLASS ATTENDANCE, AND PARTICIPANT SATISFACTION. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL AND MOOD MEASURES AS WELL AS MEASURES OF POTENTIAL INTERVENTION MECHANISMS AT BASELINE AND IMMEDIATELY POSTINTERVENTION. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS IN BOTH CONDITIONS REPORTED HIGH LEVELS OF SATISFACTION AND REASONABLE CLASS ATTENDANCE RATES. HOME PRACTICE RATES WERE LOW. THERE WERE NO ADVERSE EVENTS DEEMED RELATED TO THE YI. RESULTS SHOWED A MEDIUM EFFECT SIZE IN FAVOR OF THE YI IN VISUOSPATIAL SKILLS. THE YOGA GROUP ALSO SHOWED A LARGE EFFECT SIZE INDICATING DECLINE IN PERCEIVED STRESS COMPARED WITH THE HLE GROUP, WHEREAS HLE RESULTED IN GREATER REDUCTIONS IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AFTER THE INTERVENTION (LARGE EFFECT SIZE). CONCLUSIONS: STUDY FINDINGS INDICATED THAT THE YI WAS SAFE, MODESTLY FEASIBLE, AND ACCEPTABLE TO OLDER ADULTS WITH MCI. THE AUTHORS FOUND PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE THAT YOGA MAY IMPROVE VISUOSPATIAL FUNCTIONING IN INDIVIDUALS WITH MCI. RESULTS SUPPORT STRESS REDUCTION AS A POSSIBLE MECHANISM FOR THE YI. FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD ADDRESS A YI IN A LARGER SAMPLE AND INCLUDE STRATEGIES TO ENHANCE ENGAGEMENT AND HOME PRACTICE.	2022

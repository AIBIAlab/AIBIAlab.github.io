1  624 122 DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2 AND YOGA: ELECTRO PHOTONIC IMAGING PERSPECTIVE. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS THE MOST POPULAR FORM OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2. THE ELECTRO-PHOTONIC IMAGING (EPI) IS ANOTHER CONTRIBUTION FROM ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE IN HEALTH MONITORING. AIM: TO EVALUATE DIABETES FROM EPI PERSPECTIVE. OBJECTIVES: (1) COMPARE VARIOUS EPI PARAMETERS IN NORMAL, PREDIABETIC AND DIABETIC PATIENTS. (2) FIND DIFFERENCE IN CONTROLLED AND UNCONTROLLED DIABETES. (3) STUDY THE EFFECT OF 7 DAYS DIABETES-SPECIFIC YOGA PROGRAM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FOR THE FIRST OBJECTIVE, THERE WERE 102 PATIENTS (NORMAL 29, PREDIABETIC 13, DIABETIC 60). IN THE SECOND STUDY, THERE WERE 60 PATIENTS (CONTROLLED DIABETES 27, UNCONTROLLED DIABETES 33). THE THIRD STUDY COMPRISED 37 PATIENTS. EPI PARAMETERS WERE RELATED TO GENERAL HEALTH AS WELL TO SPECIFIC ORGANS. RESULTS: IN THE FIRST STUDY, SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN (1) DIABETICS AND NORMAL: AVERAGE INTENSITY 5.978, FORM COEFFICIENT 3.590, IMMUNE ORGANS 0.281 ALL P < 0.001; (2) DIABETICS AND PREDIABETICS: AVERAGE INTENSITY 6.676, FORM COEFFICIENT 4.158, IMMUNE ORGANS 5.890 P < 0.032; (3) NORMAL AND PREDIABETES: IMMUNE ORGANS (-6.171 P = 000). IN THE SECOND STUDY, REMARKABLE DIFFERENCE WAS IN THE IMMUNE ORGANS (0.201, P = 0.031). IN THE PRE- AND POST-STUDY, THE MEAN DIFFERENCE WAS: AREA 630.37, FORM COEFFICIENT 1.78, ENTROPY 0.03, LIVER 0.24, PANCREAS 0.17, CORONARY VESSELS 0.11, AND LEFT KIDNEY 29, WITH ALL P < 0.02. CONCLUSION: THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN EPI PARAMETERS BETWEEN NORMAL, PREDIABETICS AND DIABETICS, THE PROMINENT BEING AVERAGE INTENSITY, FORM COEFFICIENT, AND IMMUNE ORGANS. BETWEEN CONTROLLED AND UNCONTROLLED DIABETES, IMMUNE ORGANS SHOW SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. INTERVENTION OF YOGA RESULTS IN CHANGE IN MOST PARAMETERS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
2  405  26 BIOENERGY AND ITS IMPLICATION FOR YOGA THERAPY. ELECTRO PHOTONIC IMAGING (EPI) IS BEING RESEARCHED RELATIVE TO ITS APPLICATION FOR YOGA THERAPY. THREE PARAMETERS OF INTEREST IN EPI MEASUREMENTS ARE AS FOLLOWS: COMMUNICATION ENERGY (C), INTEGRAL OR NORMALIZED AREA (IA), AND ENTROPY (E). IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT C INDICATES THE TOTAL ENERGY OF COMMUNICATION FOR THE ORGAN SYSTEM; IA IS AN INDICATION OF TOTAL AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR THE ORGAN SYSTEM WHILE ENTROPY IS AN INDICATION OF THE AMOUNT OF COHERENCE OF THE ENERGY. COHERENCE AND ENTROPY ARE INVERSELY RELATED; THIS MEANS LESS THE ENTROPY, MORE THE COHERENCE AND VICE VERSA. ILLUSTRATIVE CASES OF SUCCESSFUL THERAPY WITH YOGA PRACTICES IN A WIDE VARIETY OF ABNORMAL CONDITIONS ARE EXAMINED, AND IN EVERY CASE, ENTROPY IS SHOWN TO DECREASE FOR THE AFFECTED ORGAN SYSTEM WHILE COMMUNICATION ENERGY STAYS WITHIN STABLE RANGE. RELATIVE TO THE ELECTROMAGNETIC (RUBIK) AND LIVING MATRIX (OSCHMAN) MODELS, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE REGULATION OF ENERGY, ITS COHERENCE IN THE BIOLOGICAL SYSTEM AND INTERACTION WITH LIFE PROCESSES PROVIDE THE BASIS FOR MODEL BUILDING AND DESIGN OF HEALTH-PROMOTING PROCEDURES. FURTHER, THIS APPROACH IS EXAMINED RELATIVE TO YOGA THEORY, TRADITIONAL MEDICINE SYSTEMS, AND SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FIELD OF GENE EXPRESSION AND NEUROPLASTICITY AND A GENERALIZED MODEL THAT WE CALL UNIFIED SYSTEM OF MEDICINE IS PROPOSED. THIS MODEL HAS DIRECT IMPLICATIONS ON METHODS USED TO CONTROL THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS TO GET ROBUST RESULTS FROM EPI APPLICATION FOR THERAPEUTIC PURPOSES. IMPLICATIONS FOR FURTHERING RESEARCH IN YOGA THERAPY USING EPI AND IMPLICATIONS OF EPI AS A TRANSLATIONAL TECHNOLOGY BETWEEN TRADITIONAL MEDICINE SYSTEMS AND MODERN MEDICINE IS DISCUSSED.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
3  785  38 EFFECT OF YOGA BASED TECHNIQUES ON STRESS AND HEALTH INDICES USING ELECTRO PHOTONIC IMAGING TECHNIQUE IN MANAGERS. BACKGROUND: MEDITATION TECHNIQUES ARE KNOWN TO ELICIT RELAXATION RESPONSE IN WHICH MOVING MEDITATION WHICH COMBINES THE PRACTICE OF YOGA POSTURES AND GUIDED RELAXATION IS KNOWN AS CYCLIC MEDITATION REPORTED HELPFUL IN REDUCING THE SYMPATHETIC AROUSAL AND IMPROVING HEALTH OF PRACTITIONERS. OBJECTIVES: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF CYCLIC MEDITATION ON STRESS AND HEALTH INDICES IN MANAGERS AS MEASURED BY ELECTRO PHOTONIC IMAGING (EPI) TECHNIQUE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: EPI TECHNIQUE WAS USED TO ASSESS PARTICIPANTS BEFORE AND AFTER 35 MIN OF CYCLIC MEDITATION (CM) AND EQUAL DURATION OF SUPINE REST (SR) SESSION. A TOTAL OF SIXTY SIX MALE MANAGERS, AGE RANGES FROM 35 TO 60 YEARS (MEAN +/- SD 53.97 +/- 5.96) WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. EPI PARAMETERS, INCLUDING ACTIVATION COEFFICIENT, INTEGRAL AREA LEFT AND RIGHT AND INTEGRAL ENTROPY, LEFT AND RIGHT WERE TAKEN FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSES. RESULTS: CYCLIC MEDITATION HAS PRODUCED A HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN STRESS LEVEL, WHEREAS THIS REDUCTION WAS NOT FOUND SIGNIFICANT WITHIN SR GROUP. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN HEALTH INDEX 'INTEGRAL AREA' VALUES IN BOTH LEFT AND RIGHT SIDES WITHIN THE CM GROUP WHILE ONLY IA RIGHT SIDE SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT WITHIN THE CM GROUP. THE INTEGRAL ENTROPY VALUE RIGHT SIDE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY WITHIN THE CM GROUP, WHEREAS IE LEFT WAS FOUND DETERIORATED WITHIN THE SR GROUP. MOREOVER, ONLY IE LEFT SIDE HAS SHOWN A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GROUPS. CONCLUSION: THE INVESTIGATIONS IN THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT CYCLIC MEDITATION PRACTICE REDUCES STRESS AND IMPROVES PSYCHOSOMATIC HEALTH INDICES MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN SUPINE REST IN MANAGERS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
4 1094  35 EFFECTS OF YOGA PRACTICE ON ACUMERIDIAN ENERGIES: VARIANCE REDUCTION IMPLIES BENEFITS FOR REGULATION. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: THIS PAPER CONCERNS MECHANISMS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EFFICACY OF YOGA MEDICINE, TRADITIONALLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE ENLIVENMENT OF PRANA. OUR STRATEGY WAS TO INVESTIGATE LEVELS OF QI IN ACUPUNCTURE MERIDIANS, SINCE QI IS USUALLY CONSIDERED EQUIVALENT TO PRANA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ELECTRODERMAL MEASUREMENTS AT ACUMERIDIAN ENDPOINTS (TSING POINTS) WERE MADE ON 32 HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS, PRE AND POST 3 WEEKS YOGA LIFESTYLE PROGRAM USING ACUGRAPH 3 (AN INSTRUMENT IN WIDE USE). A PREVIOUS STUDY FOUND THAT INHERENT ERRORS PREVENT ACUGRAPH FROM PRECISELY EVALUATING QI ENERGIES IN SINGLE MERIDIANS, SO GROUP RESULTS ARE REPORTED: (A) ENERGY LEVELS, (B) ENERGY STABILITY, AND (C) ENERGY BALANCE BETWEEN (I) YIN/YANG MERIDIANS, (II) UPPER AND LOWER, AND (III) LEFT AND RIGHT REGIONS OF THE BODY. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE OBSERVED IN ALL BUT ENERGY STABILITY, SUPPORTING THE IDEAS THAT YOGA ENLIVENS PRANA, AND THAT BALANCE IN MERIDIANS CONSTITUTES HEALTH. FOR BALANCE VARIABLES, THE STUDY OBSERVED SHIFTS TOWARD NORMAL AT BOTH ENDS OF VARIABLE DISTRIBUTIONS, REDUCING STANDARD DEVIATIONS: POST-INTERVENTION PERCENTAGES OF SUBJECTS WITH VALUES IN THE 'HEALTHY' RANGE INCREASED. CONCLUSION: YOGA IMPROVED REGULATION OF QI LEVELS IN ACUMERIDIAN MERIDIANS AS WELL AS INCREASING THEM.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
5 1703  33 PARTITIONING OF RADIOLOGICAL, STRESS AND BIOCHEMICAL CHANGES IN PRE-DIABETIC WOMEN SUBJECTED TO DIABETIC YOGA PROTOCOL. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS AN ANCIENT SYSTEM OF WELLNESS WITH ASANA AND PRANAYAMA AS ITS MOST POPULAR AND PROPAGATED MODULES FOR MANAGEMENT OF LIFESTYLE DISORDERS. OBJECTIVES: THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO CHARACTERISE THE LIVER ABNORMALITIES, BIOCHEMICAL CHANGES, AND STRESS LEVELS AFTER YOGA INTERVENTION IN PREDIABETIC FEMALES. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 37 FEMALES WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO YOGA PRACTISING AND NON-PRACTISING CONTROL GROUPS. THE YOGA PRACTISING GROUP PERFORMED DIABETIC YOGA PROTOCOL (DYP) FOR 3 MONTHS. PARAMETERS INCLUDING SIZE OF LIVER, FATTY INFILTRATION, AND GRADE OF SEVERITY WERE MEASURED USING ULTRASONOGRAPHY ALONG WITH BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS AND STRESS LEVELS AT BASELINE AND AFTER YOGA PRACTICE. RESULTS: THE GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN (HBA1C) AND GLUCOSE LEVELS WERE FOUND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED IN PREDIABETIC (P=0.015) WOMEN AFTER PRACTISING DYP, ALTHOUGH CHOLESTEROL LEVELS INCREASED IN MENOPAUSAL WOMEN. NO ESCALATION OF FATTY LIVER WAS NOTED AMONG WOMEN PRACTISING DYP. CONCLUSION: DYP REDUCED THE HBA1C AND STRESS LEVELS AND THEREFORE, COULD BE A COST-EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR PREVENTING PREDIABETES TO DIABETES PROGRESSION.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
6 1877  19 REAL-WORLD FNIRS BRAIN ACTIVITY MEASUREMENTS DURING ASHTANGA VINYASA YOGA. FUNCTIONAL NEAR-INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY (FNIRS) IS OFTEN PRAISED FOR ITS PORTABILITY AND ROBUSTNESS TOWARDS MOTION ARTIFACTS. WHILE AN INCREASING BODY OF FNIRS RESEARCH IN REAL-WORLD ENVIRONMENTS IS EMERGING, MOST FNIRS STUDIES ARE STILL CONDUCTED IN LABORATORIES, AND DO NOT INCORPORATE LARGER MOVEMENTS PERFORMED BY PARTICIPANTS. THIS STUDY EXTENDS FNIRS APPLICATIONS IN REAL-WORLD ENVIRONMENTS BY CONDUCTING A SINGLE-SUBJECT OBSERVATIONAL STUDY OF A YOGA PRACTICE WITH CONSIDERABLE MOVEMENT (ASHTANGA VINYASA YOGA) IN A PARTICIPANT'S NATURAL ENVIRONMENT (THEIR APARTMENT). THE RESULTS SHOW DIFFERENCES IN COGNITIVE LOAD (PREFRONTAL CORTEX ACTIVATION) WHEN COMPARING TECHNICALLY COMPLEX POSTURES TO RELATIVELY SIMPLE ONES, BUT ALSO SOME CONTRASTS WITH SURPRISINGLY LITTLE DIFFERENCE. THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE BOUNDARIES OF REAL-WORLD COGNITIVE LOAD MEASUREMENTS, AND CONTRIBUTES TO THE EMPIRICAL KNOWLEDGE BASE OF USING FNIRS IN REALISTIC SETTINGS. TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST DEMONSTRATION OF FNIRS BRAIN IMAGING RECORDED DURING ANY MOVING YOGA PRACTICE. FUTURE WORK WITH FNIRS SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS BY ACCOMPLISHING STUDIES WITH CONSIDERABLE REAL-WORLD MOVEMENT.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
7 2153  23 THE EFFECTS OF SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA ON SOME PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS IN MILD HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS. AN OPEN LABEL INTERVENTION STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN ON 26 MILD HYPERTENSIVES AND 26 APPARENTLY HEALTHY ADULTS (30-60 Y), FOR THE EFFECT OF SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA PRACTICE FOR TWO MONTHS AS COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY. IN THE HYPERTENSIVES, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (P < 0.01), SERUM UREA (P < 0.01) AND PLASMA MDA (MALONDIALDEHYDE ADDUCTS) AS OXIDATIVE STRESS MARKER (P < 0.05). OTHER PARAMETERS; VIZ.; PLASMA LEVELS OF CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDES, GLUCOSE, DID NOT CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY (P > 0.1). THE PATTERN OF CHANGE IN MOST OF THE STUDY PARAMETERS WAS SUCH THAT VALUES ABOVE NORMAL RANGE WERE LOWERED BUT VALUES WITHIN NORMAL RANGE WERE UNALTERED. THE ACTION OF YOGA ON DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE, MALONDIALDEHYDE ADDUCTS AND KIDNEY FUNCTION IN HYPERTENSIVES WAS OF COUNTERACTIVE NATURE AND FELT TO BE DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT THAN THE EFFECT OF DRUGS.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
8 1357  17 IMMEDIATE EFFECT OF TWO YOGA-BASED RELAXATION TECHNIQUES ON PERFORMANCE IN A LETTER-CANCELLATION TASK. THE PERFORMANCE IN A SIX-LETTER CANCELLATION TASK WAS ASSESSED WITH 69 MALE VOLUNTEERS, AGES 18 TO 48 YEARS, IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND AFTER TWO YOGA-BASED RELAXATION TECHNIQUES AND A CONTROL SESSION OF EQUAL DURATION. THE TECHNIQUES WERE CYCLIC MEDITATION AND SUPINE REST. CYCLIC MEDITATION CONSISTS OF ALTERNATING CYCLES OF YOGA POSTURES AND SUPINE REST. AFTER BOTH PRACTICES, THE NET SCORES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER, ALTHOUGH THE MAGNITUDE OF CHANGE WAS MORE AFTER CYCLIC MEDITATION THAN AFTER SUPINE REST (24.9% VERSUS 13.6%). THERE WAS REDUCTION IN SCORES FOR WRONG CANCELLATIONS AFTER CYCLIC MEDITATION AND NOT AFTER SUPINE REST. THE CONTROL GROUP SHOWED NO CHANGE. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT CYCLIC MEDITATION BRINGS ABOUT A GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN PERFORMANCE IN THIS TASK, WHICH REQUIRES SELECTIVE ATTENTION, CONCENTRATION, VISUAL SCANNING ABILITIES, AND A REPETITIVE MOTOR RESPONSE.	2007

YOGA PRACTICE IS USEFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF VARIOUS LIFESTYLE DISEASES, INCLUDING TYPE 2 DIABETES. PSYCHO-NEURO-ENDOCRINE AND IMMUNE MECHANISMS ARE INVOLVED IN THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA ON DIABETES. INCORPORATION OF YOGA PRACTICE IN DAILY LIFE HELPS TO ATTAIN GLYCAEMIC CONTROL AND REDUCES THE RISK OF COMPLICATIONS IN PEOPLE WITH DIABETES. IN THIS REVIEW, WE BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THE ROLE OF VARIOUS YOGA PRACTICES IN THE MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES BASED ON EVIDENCE FROM VARIOUS CLINICAL STUDIES.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
10  374  34 AYURVEDA BODY-MIND CONSTITUTIONAL TYPES AND ROLE OF YOGA INTERVENTION AMONG TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS POPULATION OF CHANDIGARH AND PANCHKULA REGIONS. BACKGROUND: TYPE 2 DIABETES NEEDS A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF ETIOLOGICAL FACTORS AND MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES BASED ON LIFESTYLE AND CONSTITUTIONAL FACTORS, GIVEN ITS HIGH ASSOCIATION RATE WITH MANY CARDIOVASCULAR, NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS, AND COVID-19 INFECTION. PURPOSE: THE PRESENT STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF DIABETES-SPECIFIC INTEGRATED YOGA LIFESTYLE PROTOCOL (DYP) ON GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND LIPID PROFILES OF DIABETIC ADULTS. ALONG WITH THE DYP INTERVENTION, THE INDIVIDUALS RESIDING IN CHANDIGARH AND PANCHKULA UNION TERRITORIES IN THE NORTHERN PART OF INDIA WERE ASSESSED FOR AYURVEDA-BASED BODY-MIND CONSTITUTIONAL TYPE. AYURVEDA DESCRIBES BODY-MIND CONSTITUTION AS "PRAKRITI," WHICH HAS BEEN DISCUSSED FROM TWO ANGLES, NAMELY PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL AS BODY AND MIND ARE CORRELATED. METHODS: CLUSTER SAMPLING OF WAITLIST CONTROL STUDY SUBJECTS WAS USED AS THE SAMPLING METHOD FOR THE STUDY. A TOTAL OF 1,215 REGISTERED SUBJECTS (81 DIABETIC) RESPONDED IN RANDOMLY SELECTED CLUSTERS IN CHANDIGARH AND PANCHKULA. AYURVEDA PHYSICIANS DID AYURVEDA BODY-MIND CONSTITUTIONAL ASSESSMENT CALLED PRAKRITI ASSESSMENT (PHYSIOLOGICAL BODY-MIND CONSTITUTION ASSESSMENT) IN 35 PARTICIPANTS (23 DIABETIC, 12 PREDIABETIC) AS A PART OF THE STUDY. RESULTS: A GROUP OF 50 SUBJECTS WAS RANDOMLY SELECTED FOR YOGA INTERVENTION OUT OF 81 DIABETES MELLITUS ADULTS, AND 31 SUBJECTS WERE ENROLLED AS WAITLIST CONTROLS. A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN LEVELS FROM 8.49 +/- 1.94% TO 7.97 +/- 2.20% IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP WAS NOTICED. THE LIPID PROFILES OF THE DYP INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS WERE MONITORED. THREE-MONTH FOLLOW-UP RESULTS OF LIPID PROFILE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS IN INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS (P < 0.05). MOST DIABETIC AND PREDIABETIC INDIVIDUALS WERE FOUND TO HAVE PITTA DOSHA (PITTA CONTROLS ALL HEAT, METABOLISM, AND TRANSFORMATION IN THE MIND AND BODY) AS DOMINANT CONSTITUTION TYPE. CONCLUSION: THE STUDY RESULTS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN DIABETIC INDIVIDUALS. THIS STUDY HAS INDICATED THE EVIDENCE FOR THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THE VALIDATED DYP FOR COMMUNITY-LEVEL INTERVENTIONS TO PREVENT MALADIES LIKE BRAIN DAMAGE AND STROKE.	2020	
                                                                                                                            
11 1455  27 INFLUENCE OF TIME OF YOGA PRACTICE AND GENDER DIFFERENCES ON BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS IN TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS AND NORMAL HEALTHY ADULTS. BACKGROUND: PREVALENCE OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM) IS INCREASING WORLDWIDE. MANY STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN IMPROVING GLYCAEMIC CONTROL, WHEREAS NO STUDIES ARE AVAILABLE SHOWING THE IMPACT OF TIME OF PRACTICE ON GLUCOSE LEVELS. THE CURRENT STUDY EXPLORES THE EFFECT OF TIME OF YOGA PRACTICE ON GLUCOSE LEVELS IN COMMUNITY-DWELLING ADULTS WITH AND WITHOUT T2DM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 189 SUBJECTS WITH T2DM AND 121 SUBJECTS WITHOUT T2DM UNDERWENT A 10-DAY YOGA PROGRAM WHICH INCLUDES PRACTICAL AND THEORY LECTURE SESSIONS FOR 60MIN EVERY DAY, EITHER IN THE MORNING OR EVENING. BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION ASSESSMENTS OF FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE (FPG) WERE MEASURED ON DAY-1 AND DAY-10, RESPECTIVELY. DATA ANALYSIS WERE DONE USING STATISTICAL PACKAGE FOR THE SOCIAL SCIENCES (SPSS), VERSION 16. RESULTS: RESULTS OF THE STUDY SHOWED THAT IN INDIVIDUALS WITH T2DM, A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER REDUCTION IN FPG WAS OBSERVED WHILE PRACTICING YOGA IN THE EVENING SESSIONS THAN IN THE MORNING SESSIONS. LIKEWISE, A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN FPG WAS OBSERVED ONLY IN WOMEN WHO PRACTICED YOGA IN THE EVENING THAN IN THE MORNING, IN NON-DIABETIC HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS, WHILE THE REDUCTION WAS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IN MEN. CONCLUSION: RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT REDUCTION IN FPG LEVEL WAS BETTER WHILE PRACTICING YOGA IN EVENING THAN MORNING. SIMILARLY, WOMEN HAD A BETTER REDUCTION IN BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL THAN MEN.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
12 2889  41 YOGA: MANAGING OVERWEIGHT IN MID-LIFE T2DM. BACKGROUND: THE DRAMATIC RISE IN THE PREVALENCE OF OBESITY AND TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM) IS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED MORTALITY, MORBIDITY AS WELL AS PUBLIC HEALTH CARE EXPENSES WORLDWIDE. PREVIOUS RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT YOGA HOLDS PROMISE FOR OBESITY AND T2DM MANAGEMENT. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF INTENSIVE INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY (IAYT) ON BODY FAT AND BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) AND RESTING METABOLISM IN MID-LIFE OVERWEIGHT PATIENTS WITH T2DM (BMI, MEAN +/- SD, 27.05 +/- 4.51). MATERIALS AND METHODS: TWENTY-FOUR MID-LIFE PATIENTS (6 FEMALES) WITH T2DM (AGE, MEAN +/- SD, 55.38 +/- 7.96 YEARS) PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY AND PRACTICED IAYT FOR 7 DAYS. THE IAYT WORKS AT FIVE LAYERS OF HUMAN EXISTENCE (PHYSICAL, VITAL, MENTAL, INTELLECTUAL AND BLISS) TO BRING POSITIVE HEALTH. THE BODY FAT AND BMI AND RESTING METABOLISM WERE RECORDED BEFORE AND AFTER IAYT USING KARADA SCAN BODY COMPOSITION MONITOR HBF-375 FROM OMRON HEALTHCARE SINGAPORE PTE LTD. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: SPSS-16 WAS USED TO ANALYZE THE DATA. SHAPIRO-WILK TEST SHOWED THAT THE DATA WAS NOT NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED. FURTHER, THE WILCOXON SIGNED-RANKS TEST WAS USED TO ANALYZE THE CHANGE IN MEANS OF PRE- AND POST-MEASUREMENTS. RESULTS: DATA ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN BODY FAT AND BMI AND RESTING METABOLISM (IN ALL ASSESSMENTS, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: THE PRESENT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT 7 DAYS PRACTICE OF IAYT HAS A GREAT PROMISE FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF OVERWEIGHT IN MID-LIFE PATIENTS WITH T2DM. ADDITIONAL WELL-DESIGNED STUDIES ARE NEEDED BEFORE A STRONG RECOMMENDATION CAN BE MADE.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
13 1453  27 INFLUENCE OF PRANAYAMAS AND YOGA-ASANAS ON SERUM INSULIN, BLOOD GLUCOSE AND LIPID PROFILE IN TYPE 2 DIABETES. A DISTINGUISHABLE FEATURE OF TYPE 2 DIABETES BESIDES HYPERGLYCEMIA AND DERANGED LIPID PROFILE IS AN IMPAIRED INSULIN SECRETION, PERIPHERAL INSULIN RESISTANCE AND OBESITY WHICH HAS BECOME A MAJOR HEALTH CONCERN WORLDWIDE. INDIA WITH AN ESTIMATED 31MILLION DIABETICS IN 2000 AND 79MLLIONS BY THE YR 2030 HAS THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF TYPE 2 DIABETICS IN THE WORLD. IN THIS STUDY, WE AIMED TO SEE IF YOGA-ASANAS AND PRANAYAMAS HAVE ANY INFLUENCE IN MODIFYING CERTAIN BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS. SIXTY PATIENTS OF UNCOMPLICATED TYPE 2 DIABETES (AGE 35-60 YRS OF 1-10 YRS DURATION) WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: GROUP 1 (N=30): PERFORMED YOGA ALONG WITH THE CONVENTIONAL HYPOGLYCEMIC MEDICINES AND GROUP 2 (N=30): PATIENTS WHO ONLY RECEIVED CONVENTIONAL MEDICINES. DURATION OF THE STUDY WAS 45 DAYS. BASAL RECORDINGS OF BLOOD GLUCOSE (FASTING AND POST-PRANDIAL), LIPID PROFILE AND SERUM INSULIN WERE TAKEN AT THE TIME OF RECRUITMENT AND THE SECOND READING AFTER FORTY FIVE DAYS. RESULTS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ALL THE BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS IN GROUP 1 WHILE GROUP 2 SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ONLY FEW PARAMETERS, THUS SUGGESTING A BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF YOGA REGIMEN ON THESE PARAMETERS IN DIABETIC PATIENTS.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
14  876  40 EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY ON REACTION TIME, BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS AND WELLNESS SCORE OF PERI AND POST-MENOPAUSAL DIABETIC PATIENTS. BACKGROUND: YOGIC PRACTICES MAY AID IN THE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES MELLITUS (DM) AND REDUCE CARDIOVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS IN THE POPULATION. THE PRESENT STUDY HAS BEEN UNDERTAKEN TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY ON REACTION TIME, BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS AND WELLNESS SCORE OF PERI AND POST-MENOPAUSAL DIABETIC PATIENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 15 PERI AND POST-MENOPAUSAL PATIENTS RECEIVING STANDARD MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR TYPE 2 DM WERE RECRUITED AND REACTION TIME AND BIOCHEMICAL INVESTIGATIONS WERE DONE BEFORE AND AFTER A COMPREHENSIVE YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM COMPRISING OF THREE TIMES A WEEK SESSIONS FOR SIX WEEKS. A POST-INTERVENTION, RETROSPECTIVE WELLNESS QUESTIONNAIRE COMPILED BY ACYTER WAS USED TO EVALUATE THE COMPARATIVE FEELINGS OF THE PATIENTS AFTER THE THERAPY PROGRAM. RESULTS: YOGA TRAINING REDUCED AUDITORY REACTION TIME (ART) FROM RIGHT AS WELL AS LEFT HAND, THE DECREASE BEING STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P<0.05) FOR ART FROM THE RIGHT HAND. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT (P<0.01) DECREASE IN FASTING AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS AS WELL AS LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN. THE DECREASE IN TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDES, AND VERY LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN AND INCREASE IN HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN WAS ALSO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P<0.05). ALL THE LIPID RATIOS SHOWED DESIRABLE IMPROVEMENT WITH A DECREASE (P<0.01) OF TC/HDL AND LDL/HDL RATIOS AND INCREASE (P<0.05) IN THE HDL/LDL RATIO. DISCUSSION OR CONCLUSION: SHORTENING OF RT IMPLIES AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE INFORMATION PROCESSING AND REFLEXES AND IS THE FIRST SUCH REPORT IN DIABETIC PATIENTS. THIS HAS CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE AND IS WORTH FURTHER EXPLORATION WITH WIDER, WELL CONTROLLED, RANDOMIZED STUDIES IN THE DIABETIC POPULATION. CHANGES IN BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS MAY BE DUE TO IMPROVED INSULIN SENSITIVITY, DECLINE IN INSULIN RESISTANCE AND INCREASED SENSITIVITY OF THE PANCREATIC B CELLS TO GLUCOSE SIGNALS. YOGA IMPROVED THE 'HEART FRIENDLY' STATUS OF LIPID PROFILE IN OUR SUBJECTS AND AS OUR PARTICIPANTS WERE PERI AND POST-MENOPAUSAL, THE DECREASE IN CARDIOVASCULAR RISK PROFILE IS OF GREATER SIGNIFICANCE. A COMPREHENSIVE YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ENHANCE THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF STANDARD MEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES MELLITUS AND CAN BE USED AS AN EFFECTIVE COMPLEMENTARY OR INTEGRATIVE THERAPY PROGRAM.	2012	
                                                                                             
15  458  21 CHANGES IN P300 FOLLOWING TWO YOGA-BASED RELAXATION TECHNIQUES. CYCLIC MEDITATION (CM) IS A TECHNIQUE THAT COMBINES "STIMULATING" AND "CALMING" PRACTICES, BASED ON A STATEMENT IN ANCIENT YOGA TEXTS SUGGESTING THAT SUCH A COMBINATION MAY BE ESPECIALLY HELPFUL TO REACH A STATE OF MENTAL EQUILIBRIUM. THE CHANGES IN THE PEAK LATENCY AND PEAK AMPLITUDE OF P300 AUDITORY EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS WERE STUDIED BEFORE AND AFTER THE PRACTICE OF CYCLIC MEDITATION COMPARED TO AN EQUAL DURATION OF SUPINE REST IN 42 VOLUNTEERS (GROUP MEAN AGE +/- SD, 27 +/- 6.3 YEARS), FROM FZ, CZ, AND PZ ELECTRODE SITES REFERENCED TO LINKED EARLOBES. THE SESSIONS WERE ONE DAY APART AND THE ORDER WAS ALTERNATED. THERE WAS REDUCTION IN THE PEAK LATENCIES OF P300 AFTER CYCLIC MEDITATION AT FZ, CZ, AND PZ COMPARED TO THE "PRE" VALUES. A SIMILAR TREND OF REDUCTION IN P300 PEAK LATENCIES AT FZ, CZ, AND PZ WAS ALSO OBSERVED AFTER SUPINE REST, COMPARED TO THE RESPECTIVE "PRE" VALUES, ALTHOUGH THE MAGNITUDE OF CHANGE IN EACH CASE WAS LESS AFTER SUPINE REST COMPARED TO AFTER CYCLIC MEDITATION. THE P300 PEAK AMPLITUDES AFTER CM WERE HIGHER AT FZ, CZ, AND PZ SITES COMPARED TO THE "PRE" VALUES. IN CONTRAST, NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE OBSERVED IN THE P300 PEAK AMPLITUDES AT FZ, CZ, AND PZ AFTER SUPINE REST COMPARED TO THE RESPECTIVE "PRE" STATE. THE PRESENT RESULTS SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT "CYCLIC" MEDITATION ENHANCES COGNITIVE PROCESSES UNDERLYING THE GENERATION OF THE P300.	2006	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
16  882  27 EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON LIPID METABOLISM IN INDUSTRIAL WORKERS WITH REFERENCE TO BODY CONSTITUTION (PRAKRITI). INTRODUCTION: THE PROGRESSIVE INCREASE IN DYSLIPIDEMIA AND PHYSICAL INACTIVITY ARE CONSIDERED TO BE MAJOR RISK FACTORS FOR THE ONSET OF NON COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. AWARENESS OF BODY CONSTITUTION PLAYS A VITAL ROLE TO REGULARISE OPTIMUM HEALTH. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS PLANNED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICES ON LIPID METABOLISM WITH REFERENCE TO SPECIFIC BODY CONSTITUTION (PRAKRITI). METHODS: A SELF-AS-CONTROL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON 36 MALE HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS BETWEEN AGE GROUP OF 30-58 YEARS. THEIR PRAKRITI ANALYSIS WAS DONE USING STANDARDIZED, VALIDATED QUESTIONNAIRE AND WERE DIVIDED INTO VATA-PITTA (N = 16) AND PITTA-KAPHA (N = 20) GROUPS. THE ASSESSMENT OF LIPID PROFILE WAS DONE IN FASTING BLOOD SAMPLES BEFORE AND AFTER 12 WEEKS OF YOGA TRAINING. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING PAIRED T-TEST AND INDEPENDENT T-TEST. RESULTS: AFTER YOGA INTERVENTION, THE RESULT OF WITHIN GROUP COMPARISON REVEALED THAT IN VATA-PITTA (V-P) GROUP, SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE LEVELS OF TC, LDL (P < 0.001) AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN HDL (P < 0.01) WAS OBSERVED. WHILE, PITTA-KAPHA (P-K) GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN TC (P < 0.001), TG (P < 0.01), LDL (P < 0.001) AND VLDL (P < 0.05) LEVELS. FURTHER, THE RESULTS BETWEEN GROUPS REVEALED THAT P-K GROUP HAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER BASELINE LEVELS OF TC, TG AND VLDL AS COMPARED TO V-P GROUP (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: THE STUDY CONCLUDES THAT YOGA PRACTICES CAN EFFECTIVELY REGULATE LIPID METABOLISM AND TOTAL BODY ENERGY EXPENDITURE WITH REFERENCE TO SPECIFIC CONSTITUTIONAL TYPE (PRAKRITI) THAT MAY ACT AS A TOOL TO ASSESS MAGNITUDE OF METABOLIC FUNCTIONS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
17  705  36 EFFECT OF INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY ON AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY (IAYT) HAD SHOWN BENEFICIAL EFFECTS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM). AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION IS ONE OF THE MAJOR COMPLICATIONS OF TYPE 2 DM. RESEARCH STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT YOGA CAN MODULATE AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS. HENCE, THE CURRENT STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF IAYT ON AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS IN TYPE 2 DIABETICS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 15 PATIENTS OF TYPE 2 DM WITH AGES RANGING FROM 35 TO 60 YEARS WERE RECRUITED FOR THE STUDY. THEY WERE DIAGNOSED WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES FROM 1-YEAR TO 15 YEARS. ASSESSMENTS WERE MADE ON DAY 1 (BEFORE YOGA) AND DAY 7 (AFTER 1-WEEK OF YOGA PRACTICE). HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV), BLOOD PRESSURE (BP) RESPONSE TO THE ISOMETRIC HANDGRIP AND HEART RATE RESPONSE TO DEEP BREATHING WERE ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER 1-WEEK OF IAYT. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE FROM 154.67-130.27 MG/DL (WILCOXON SIGNED RANK TEST, P = 0.029) FOLLOWING 1-WEEK OF IAYT. BP RESPONSE TO ISOMETRIC HAND GRIP IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY (WILCOXON SIGNED RANK TEST, P = 0.01). THERE WAS NO STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN HRV COMPONENTS AND HEART RATE RESPONSE TO DEEP BREATHING TEST. HOWEVER, THERE WAS A TREND OF INCREASE IN THE LOW FREQUENCY POWER (41.07%), HIGH FREQUENCY POWER (6.29%), TOTAL POWER (5.38%), AND STANDARD DEVIATION OF ALL NN INTERVALS (SDNN) (6.29%). CONCLUSION: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT, IAYT IMPROVED AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS IN TYPE 2 DIABETES PATIENTS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
18 1824  29 PSYCHO-NEURO-ENDOCRINE-IMMUNE MECHANISMS OF ACTION OF YOGA IN TYPE II DIABETES. YOGA HAS BEEN FOUND TO BENEFIT ALL THE COMPONENTS OF HEALTH VIZ. PHYSICAL, MENTAL, SOCIAL AND SPIRITUAL WELL BEING BY INCORPORATING A WIDE VARIETY OF PRACTICES. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF TYPE II DM AND CO-MORBIDITIES IN TYPE II DM HAS BEEN CORRELATED WITH STRESS MECHANISMS. STRESS SUPPRESSES BODY'S IMMUNE SYSTEM AND NEURO-HUMORAL ACTIONS THEREBY AFF ECTING NORMAL PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE. IT WOULD NOT BE WRONG TO STATE THAT CORRELATION OF DIABETES WITH STRESS, ANXIETY AND OTHER PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS ARE BIDIRECTIONAL AND LEAD TO DIFFICULTY IN UNDERSTANDING THE INTERRELATED MECHANISMS. TYPE II DM CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD IN ISOLATION WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS SUCH AS STRESS, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, NEURO-ENDOCRINE AND IMMUNOLOGICAL FACTORS. THERE IS NO REVIEW WHICH TRIES TO UNDERSTAND THESE MECHANISMS EXCLUSIVELY. THE PRESENT LITERATURE REVIEW AIMS TO UNDERSTAND INTERRELATED PSYCHO-NEURO-ENDOCRINE AND IMMUNOLOGICAL MECHANISMS OF ACTION OF YOGA IN TYPE II DIABETES MELLITUS. PUBLISHED LITERATURE CONCERNING MECHANISMS OF ACTION OF YOGA IN TYPE II DM EMPHASIZING PSYCHO-NEURO-ENDOCRINE OR IMMUNOLOGICAL RELATIONS WAS RETRIEVED FROM PUBMED USING KEY WORDS YOGA, TYPE II DIABETES MELLITUS, PSYCHOLOGICAL, NEURAL, ENDOCRINE, IMMUNE AND MECHANISM OF ACTION. THOSE STUDIES WHICH EXPLAINED THE PSYCHO-NEUROENDOCRINE AND IMMUNE MECHANISMS OF ACTION OF YOGA WERE INCLUDED AND REST WERE EXCLUDED. ALTHOUGH PRIMARY AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXPLAIN THESE MECHANISMS IN TYPE II DM, SOME STUDIES IN NON-DIABETIC POPULATION WHICH HAD A SIMILAR PATHWAY OF STRESS MECHANISM WAS INCLUDED BECAUSE MANY INSIGHTFUL STUDIES WERE AVAILABLE IN THAT AREA. SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED USING TERMS YOGA OR YOGIC AND DIABETES OR DIABETIC IN TITLE OR ABSTRACT FOR ENGLISH ARTICLES. OF THE 89 ARTICLES, WE EXCLUDED NON-ENGLISH ARTICLES (22), EDITORIALS (20) AND LETTERS TO EDITOR (10). 37 STUDIES WERE CONSIDERED FOR THIS REVIEW. THE POSTULATED MECHANISM OF ACTION OF YOGA IS THROUGH PARASYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION AND THE ASSOCIATED ANTI STRESS MECHANISM. IT REDUCES PERCEIVED STRESS AND HPA AXIS ACTIVATION THEREBY IMPROVING OVERALL METABOLIC AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILES, INCREASING INSULIN SENSITIVITY, AND IMPROVING GLUCOSE TOLERANCE AND LIPID METABOLISM. YOGA HAS POSITIVE EFFECTS ON IMMUNE SYSTEM OF DIABETICS.- OVERALL, TYPE II DM IS INFLUENCED BY PSYCHO-NEURO-ENDOCRINE AND IMMUNE MECHANISMS WHERE YOGA HAS IMPORTANT POSITIVE ROLE IN COMBATING STRESSORS AND IMPROVING THESE SYSTEMS TO REGAIN HEALTH.	2015	

19  454  18 CHANGES IN MIDLATENCY AUDITORY EVOKED POTENTIALS FOLLOWING TWO YOGA-BASED RELAXATION TECHNIQUES. PRACTICING MEDITATION WHILE FOCUSING ON A SOUND OR A SYMBOL INFLUENCED MIDLATENCY AUDITORY EVOKED POTENTIALS (MLAEPS). CYCLIC MEDITATION (CM) IS A TECHNIQUE COMBINING YOGA POSTURES WITH MEDITATION WHILE SUPINE, WHICH HAS INFLUENCED THE P300 EVENT-RELATED POTENTIAL. THE EFFECTS OF CM ON MLAEPS HAVE NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY STUDIED. THE MLAEPS WERE STUDIED BEFORE AND AFTER THE PRACTICE OF CM COMPARED TO AN EQUAL DURATION OF SUPINE REST (SR) IN 47 MALE VOLUNTEERS (GROUP MEAN AGE 26.5 +/- 4.4 YEARS), RECORDED FROM THE VERTEX REFERENCED TO LINKED EARLOBES. THE SESSIONS WERE ONE DAY APART AND SUBJECTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EACH SESSION. THE PA WAVE PEAK LATENCY AND NB WAVE PEAK LATENCY SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FOLLOWING CM COMPARED TO BEFORE CM (REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA, POST-HOC ANALYSIS WITH LEAST SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE, P<0.05). THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE PEAK AMPLITUDE OF THE NB WAVE (P<0.05) COMPARED TO BEFORE CM. POST SR THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE PEAK LATENCY OF THE NA WAVE (P<0.05) COMPARED TO BEFORE SR. IN CONCLUSION FOLLOWING CM THE LATENCIES OF NEURAL GENERATORS CORRESPONDING TO CORTICAL AREAS IS PROLONGED, WHEREAS FOLLOWING SR A SIMILAR CHANGE OCCURS AT MESENCEPHALIC-DIENCEPHALIC LEVELS.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
20 1555  25 LONG-TERM ASHTANGA YOGA PRACTICE DECREASES MEDIAL TEMPORAL AND BRAINSTEM GLUCOSE METABOLISM IN RELATION TO YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS INCREASINGLY POPULAR WORLDWIDE WITH SEVERAL PHYSICAL AND MENTAL BENEFITS, BUT THE UNDERLYING NEUROBIOLOGY REMAINS UNCLEAR. WHEREAS MANY STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON PURE MEDITATIONAL ASPECTS, THE TRIAD OF YOGA INCLUDES MEDITATION, POSTURES, AND BREATHING. WE CONDUCTED A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY COMPARING EXPERIENCED YOGA PRACTITIONERS TO YOGA-NAIVE HEALTHY SUBJECTS USING A MULTIPARAMETRIC 2 X 2 DESIGN WITH SIMULTANEOUS POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY/MAGNETIC RESONANCE (PET/MR) IMAGING. METHODS: (18)F-FDG PET, MORPHOMETRIC AND DIFFUSION TENSOR IMAGING, RESTING STATE FMRI, AND MR SPECTROSCOPY WERE ACQUIRED IN 10 EXPERIENCED (4.8 +/- 2.3 YEARS OF REGULAR YOGA EXPERIENCE) YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND 15 MATCHED CONTROLS IN REST AND AFTER A SINGLE PRACTICE (YOGA PRACTICE AND PHYSICAL EXERCISE, RESPECTIVELY). RESULTS: IN REST, DECREASED REGIONAL GLUCOSE METABOLISM IN THE MEDIAL TEMPORAL CORTEX, STRIATUM, AND BRAINSTEM WAS OBSERVED IN YOGA PRACTITIONERS COMPARED TO CONTROLS (P < 0.0001), WITH A SIGNIFICANT INVERSE CORRELATION OF RESTING PARAHIPPOCAMPAL AND BRAINSTEM METABOLISM WITH YEARS OF REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE (RHO < - 0.63, P < 0.05). A SINGLE YOGA PRACTICE RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT HYPERMETABOLISM IN THE CEREBELLUM (P < 0.0001). NONE OF THE MR MEASURES DIFFERED, BOTH AT REST AND AFTER INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: EXPERIENCED YOGA PRACTITIONERS SHOW REGIONAL LONG-TERM DECREASES IN GLUCOSE METABOLISM RELATED TO YEARS OF PRACTICE. TO ELUCIDATE A POTENTIAL CAUSALITY, A PROSPECTIVE LONGITUDINAL STUDY IN YOGA-NAIVE INDIVIDUALS IS WARRANTED.	2020

1  619 159 DEVELOPMENT OF THE CLARIFY (CHECKLIST STANDARDISING THE REPORTING OF INTERVENTIONS FOR YOGA) GUIDELINES: A DELPHI STUDY. BACKGROUND: THE USE OF YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC MODALITY IS INCREASING; HOWEVER, A LACK OF TRANSPARENT INTERVENTION REPORTING IS RESTRICTING THE DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF YOGA RESEARCH INTO CLINICAL AND COMMUNITY PRACTICE. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DEVELOP A YOGA-SPECIFIC REPORTING GUIDELINE AS AN EXTENSION TO EXISTING REPORTING GUIDELINES FOR RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS, OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES AND CASE REPORTS. METHODS: RECOGNISED INTERNATIONAL STAKEHOLDERS IN THE DESIGN AND CONDUCT OF YOGA RESEARCH WERE INVITED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE ELECTRONIC DELPHI SURVEY. A FOUR-ROUND DELPHI WAS CONDUCTED, WHEREBY PANELLISTS RATED SELECTED ITEMS FOR THEIR IMPORTANCE IN THE INCLUSION OF YOGA REPORTING GUIDELINES, ACCORDING TO A 5-STEP LIKERT SCALE. A PRIORI CONSENSUS FOR ITEM INCLUSION WAS AGREEMENT OF ITEMS AS 'VERY IMPORTANT' OR 'EXTREMELY IMPORTANT' BY >/=80% OF PANELLISTS. NON-CONSENSUS ITEMS WERE FORWARDED TO SUBSEQUENT ROUNDS FOR RE-RATING. RESULTS: 53 EXPERTS IN YOGA RESEARCH FROM 11 COUNTRIES, PRIMARILY IDENTIFYING AS RESEARCHERS (50%), ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS (18.8%) AND YOGA PROFESSIONALS (12.5%), CONSENTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DELPHI. OF THESE, 48 COMPLETED ROUND 1 (91%), 43 COMPLETED ROUND 2 (81%), 39 COMPLETED ROUND 3 (74%) AND 32 COMPLETED ROUND 4 (60%). PANELLISTS REACHED CONSENSUS FOR INCLUSION ON 21 ITEMS, GROUPED UNDER 10 DOMAINS REFLECTIVE OF MORE GENERIC INTERVENTION-BASED GUIDELINES. CONCLUSIONS: THE CONSENSUS-BASED 21-ITEM CLARIFY (CHECKLIST STANDARDISING THE REPORTING OF INTERVENTIONS FOR YOGA) CHECKLIST PROVIDES A MINIMUM REPORTING TEMPLATE FOR RESEARCHERS ACROSS A RANGE OF METHODOLOGY DESIGNS. USE OF THESE YOGA-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CLARIFY EXPLANATION AND ELABORATION GUIDELINES, WILL STANDARDISE THE MINIMUM LEVEL OF DETAIL REQUIRED FOR TRANSPARENT YOGA INTERVENTION, FACILITATING THE REPLICATION, DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF YOGA RESEARCH. ONGOING RESEARCH WILL ASSESS THE UPTAKE AND IMPACT OF CLARIFY, TO ENSURE THESE GUIDELINES RETAIN THEIR RELEVANCE TO THE INTERNATIONALLY GROWING FIELD OF YOGA RESEARCH.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
2 1158  73 ESTABLISHING KEY COMPONENTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS: A DELPHI SURVEY. BACKGROUND: EVIDENCE SUGGESTS YOGA IS A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, HETEROGENEITY IN THE COMPONENTS AND REPORTING OF CLINICAL YOGA TRIALS IMPEDES BOTH THE GENERALIZATION OF STUDY RESULTS AND THE REPLICATION OF STUDY PROTOCOLS. THE AIM OF THIS DELPHI SURVEY WAS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES OF HETEROGENEITY, BY DEVELOPING A LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS OF KEY COMPONENTS FOR THE DESIGN AND REPORTING OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS. METHODS: RECOGNISED EXPERTS INVOLVED IN THE DESIGN, CONDUCT, AND TEACHING OF YOGA FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS WERE IDENTIFIED FROM A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW, AND INVITED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DELPHI SURVEY. FORTY-ONE OF THE 58 EXPERTS CONTACTED, REPRESENTING SIX COUNTRIES, AGREED TO PARTICIPATE. A THREE-ROUND DELPHI WAS CONDUCTED VIA ELECTRONIC SURVEYS. ROUND 1 PRESENTED AN OPEN-ENDED QUESTION, ALLOWING PANELLISTS TO INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFY COMPONENTS THEY CONSIDERED KEY TO THE DESIGN AND REPORTING OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS. THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF ROUND 1 IDENTIFIED ITEMS FOR QUANTITATIVE RATING IN ROUND 2; ITEMS NOT REACHING CONSENSUS WERE FORWARDED TO ROUND 3 FOR RE-RATING. RESULTS: THIRTY-SIX PANELLISTS (36/41; 88%) COMPLETED THE THREE ROUNDS OF THE DELPHI SURVEY. PANELLISTS PROVIDED 348 COMMENTS TO THE ROUND 1 QUESTION. THESE COMMENTS WERE REDUCED TO 49 ITEMS, GROUPED UNDER FIVE THEMES, FOR RATING IN SUBSEQUENT ROUNDS. A PRIORI GROUP CONSENSUS OF >/=80% WAS REACHED ON 28 ITEMS RELATED TO FIVE THEMES CONCERNING DEFINING THE YOGA INTERVENTION, TYPES OF YOGA PRACTICES TO INCLUDE IN AN INTERVENTION, DELIVERY OF THE YOGA PROTOCOL, DOMAINS OF OUTCOME MEASURES, AND REPORTING OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS. ADDITIONALLY, A PRIORI CONSENSUS OF >/=50% WAS REACHED ON FIVE ITEMS RELATING TO MINIMUM VALUES FOR INTERVENTION PARAMETERS. CONCLUSIONS: EXPERT CONSENSUS HAS PROVIDED A NON-PRESCRIPTIVE REFERENCE LIST FOR THE DESIGN AND REPORTING OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS. IT IS ANTICIPATED FUTURE RESEARCH INCORPORATING THE DELPHI GUIDELINES WILL FACILITATE HIGH QUALITY INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH IN THIS FIELD, INCREASE HOMOGENEITY OF INTERVENTION COMPONENTS AND PARAMETERS, AND ENHANCE THE COMPARISON AND REPRODUCIBILITY OF RESEARCH INTO THE USE OF YOGA FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
3  475  55 CLARIFY 2021: EXPLANATION AND ELABORATION OF THE DELPHI-BASED GUIDELINES FOR THE REPORTING OF YOGA RESEARCH. BACKGROUND: REPORTING OF YOGA RESEARCH OFTEN LACKS THE DETAIL REQUIRED FOR CLINICAL APPLICATION, STUDY REPLICATION, SUMMARY RESEARCH AND COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS STUDIES. METHODS: TO IMPROVE THE TRANSPARENCY OF REPORTING YOGA INTERVENTIONS, AND BUILDING ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF PREVIOUS REPORTING GUIDELINES, A GROUP OF INTERNATIONAL YOGA RESEARCH STAKEHOLDERS DEVELOPED THE CONSENSUS-BASED CHECKLIST STANDARDISING THE REPORTING OF INTERVENTIONS FOR YOGA (CLARIFY) GUIDELINES. RESULTS: THE 21-ITEM CLARIFY CHECKLIST OUTLINES THE MINIMUM DETAILS CONSIDERED NECESSARY FOR HIGH-QUALITY REPORTING OF YOGA RESEARCH. THIS PAPER PROVIDES A DETAILED EXPLANATION OF EACH OF THE 21 ITEMS OF THE CLARIFY CHECKLIST, TOGETHER WITH MODEL EXAMPLES OF HOW TO INTEGRATE EACH ITEM INTO PUBLICATIONS OF YOGA RESEARCH. THE CLARIFY GUIDELINE SERVES AS AN EXTENSION FOR EXISTING RESEARCH REPORTING GUIDELINES, AND IS FLEXIBLE FOR USE ACROSS ALL STUDY DESIGNS. CONCLUSION: WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THE UPTAKE OF THESE REPORTING GUIDELINES BY RESEARCHERS AND JOURNALS, TO FACILITATE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE TRANSPARENCY AND UTILITY OF YOGA RESEARCH.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
4 1159  48 ESTABLISHING KEY COMPONENTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR REDUCING DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, AND IMPROVING WELL-BEING: A DELPHI METHOD STUDY. BACKGROUND: PREVIOUS RESEARCH SUGGESTS BENEFITS OF YOGA IN REDUCING DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY. HOWEVER, COMMON CONCERNS IN REVIEWS OF THE RESEARCH INCLUDE LACK OF DETAIL, RATIONALE AND CONSISTENCY OF APPROACH OF INTERVENTIONS USED. ISSUES RELATED TO HETEROGENEITY INCLUDE AMOUNT, TYPES AND DELIVERY OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS. THIS STUDY AIMS TO DOCUMENT CONSENSUS-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONSISTENCY OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR REDUCING DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY. METHODS: THE DELPHI METHOD WAS USED TO ESTABLISH CONSENSUS FROM EXPERIENCED YOGA TEACHERS. THIRTY-THREE ELIGIBLE TEACHERS WERE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE, FROM FOUR DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. TWO ROUNDS OF AN ONLINE SURVEY WERE SENT TO PARTICIPANTS. THE FIRST ROUND SOUGHT INITIAL VIEWS. THE SECOND ROUND SOUGHT CONSENSUS ON A SUMMARY OF THOSE VIEWS. SURVEY QUESTIONS RELATED TO FREQUENCY AND DURATION (DOSAGE) OF THE YOGA, APPROACHES AND TECHNIQUES TO BE INCLUDED OR AVOIDED, AND TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE FOR YOGA TEACHERS. RESULTS: TWENTY-FOUR TEACHERS AGREED TO PARTICIPATE. EIGHTEEN COMPLETED THE SECOND ROUND (N = 18). GENERAL CONSENSUS (>75% OF PARTICIPANTS IN AGREEMENT) WAS ACHIEVED ON PARAMETERS OF PRACTICE (DOSAGE): AN AVERAGE OF 30 TO 40 MINUTES, TO BE DONE 5 TIMES PER WEEK, OVER A PERIOD OF 6 WEEKS. NUMEROUS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOGA TECHNIQUES TO INCLUDE OR AVOID WERE COLLECTED IN THE FIRST ROUND. THE SECOND ROUND PRODUCED A CONSENSUS STATEMENT ON THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. BREATH REGULATION AND POSTURES WERE CONSIDERED VERY IMPORTANT OR ESSENTIAL FOR PEOPLE WITH DEPRESSION; AND RELAXATION, BREATH REGULATION AND MEDITATION BEING VERY IMPORTANT OR ESSENTIAL FOR PEOPLE WITH ANXIETY. OTHER RECOMMENDED COMPONENTS ALSO ACHIEVED CONSENSUS. THERE WAS ALSO GENERAL CONSENSUS THAT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT OR ESSENTIAL FOR TEACHERS TO HAVE A MINIMUM OF 500 TRAINING HOURS OVER 2 YEARS, AT LEAST 2 YEARS TEACHING EXPERIENCE, TRAINING IN DEVELOPING PERSONALISED YOGA PRACTICES, TRAINING IN YOGA FOR MENTAL HEALTH, AND PROFESSIONAL SUPERVISION OR MENTORING. CONCLUSIONS: THE DELPHI PROCESS HAS ACHIEVED A CONSENSUS STATEMENT ON THE APPLICATION OF YOGA FOR REDUCING ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. THIS CONSENSUS PROVIDES A CHECKLIST FOR IDENTIFICATION OF COMMONALITIES AND EVALUATION OF PAST RESEARCH. FUTURE RESEARCH CAN PROCEED TO DEVELOP AND EVALUATE CONSENSUS-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION PROTOCOLS FOR THE REDUCTION OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, AND IMPROVEMENTS IN WELL-BEING.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
5 2473  49 YOGA AS ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY IN THE TREATMENT OF PEOPLE WITH ANOREXIA NERVOSA: A DELPHI STUDY. BACKGROUND: THERE IS PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT YOGA CAN BE BENEFICIAL IN REDUCING ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND GENERAL EATING DISORDER SYMPTOMS IN PEOPLE WITH ANOREXIA NERVOSA (AN). IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER THE THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS OF YOGA ARE SUPPORTED OR UTILISED IN THE TREATMENT OF AN AMONGST CLINICAL EXPERTS. THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO EXPLORE AND SYNTHESISE EXPERT OPINION ON THE USE OF YOGA AS AN ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND OVER-EXERCISE IN INDIVIDUALS WITH AN. METHODS: A DELPHI METHODOLOGY WAS EMPLOYED, WITH CLINICIANS CONSIDERED EXPERTS IN THE TREATMENT OF AN RECRUITED INTERNATIONALLY TO FORM THE PANEL (N = 18). THE FIRST ITERATION OF QUESTIONNAIRES COMPRISED OF FOUR OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE EXPERTS' UNDERSTANDING OF THE TERM YOGA AND OPINIONS ON ITS' USE IN THERAPY GENERALLY AND MORE SPECIFICALLY IN THE TREATMENT OF AN. USING CONTENT ANALYSIS, STATEMENTS WERE DERIVED FROM THIS DATA AND INCLUDED AS LIKERT-BASED ITEMS IN TWO SUBSEQUENT ROUNDS WHERE PANELLISTS RATED THEIR LEVEL OF AGREEMENT ON EACH ITEM. SEVENTEEN OUT OF 18 RESPONDENTS COMPLETED ALL THREE ITERATIONS. RESULTS: CONSENSUS (LEVEL OF AGREEMENT DEFINED AT >/= 85%) WAS ACHIEVED FOR 36.47% OF THE ITEMS INCLUDED IN THE SECOND AND THIRD ROUNDS. THE PANEL REACHED CONSENSUS ON ITEMS DEFINING YOGA AND PERTAINING TO ITS' GENERAL BENEFITS. THE PANEL AGREED THAT YOGA IS A ADJUNCT THERAPY FOR VARIOUS PROBLEMS, CONSENSUS WAS NOT ACHIEVED ON THE SPECIFIC USE OF YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT THERAPY IN THE TREATMENT OF COMORBID ANXIETY, DEPRESSION OR TRAUMA IN PATIENTS WITH AN. ALTHOUGH THE EXPERT PANEL ACKNOWLEDGED A NUMBER OF BENEFITS FOR USE OF YOGA IN AN, THEY STRONGLY ENDORSED THAT FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL RISKS OF USING YOGA AS AN EMBODIED PRACTICE. CONCLUSIONS: IT IS POSSIBLE THAT YOGA COULD BE CONSIDERED FOR INCLUSION IN FUTURE GUIDELINES IF SUPPORTED BY EMPIRICAL RESEARCH. WE CONCLUDE THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE ENOUGH CONSENSUS THAT SUCH FURTHER SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION IS WARRANTED. THIS STUDY AIMED TO EXPLORE EXPERT OPINION ON THE USE OF YOGA AS AN ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND OVER-EXERCISE IN INDIVIDUALS WITH ANOREXIA NERVOSA (AN). CLINICIANS CONSIDERED EXPERTS IN THE TREATMENT OF AN RECRUITED INTERNATIONALLY TO FORM THE PANEL (N = 18). EXPERTS WERE ASKED ABOUT THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE TERM YOGA AND THEIR OPINIONS ON ITS' USE IN THERAPY. THE PANEL REACHED CONSENSUS ON ITEMS DEFINING YOGA AND PERTAINING TO ITS' GENERAL BENEFITS. ALTHOUGH THE PANEL AGREED THAT YOGA IS A NICE ADDITIONAL THERAPY FOR VARIOUS PROBLEMS, CONSENSUS WAS NOT ACHIEVED ON THE USE OF YOGA AS AN ADDITIONAL THERAPY IN THE TREATMENT OF SPECIFIC PROBLEMS LIKE ANXIETY, DEPRESSION OR TRAUMA IN PEOPLE WITH AN. THE EXPERT PANEL ACKNOWLEDGED A NUMBER OF BENEFITS FOR USE OF YOGA IN AN. HOWEVER THE PANEL STRONGLY CONSIDERED THAT FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL RISKS OF USING YOGA AS AN EMBODIED PRACTICE. THE AREAS OF COLLECTIVE AGREEMENT GAINED IN THE STUDY CAN SERVE AS PRELIMINARY GUIDELINES FOR THE USE OF YOGA IN AN WHILST GUIDING FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS.	2021	

6  541  37 COMPONENTS AND REPORTING OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS. OBJECTIVES: TO IDENTIFY THE CONTENT AND REPORTING DETAILS OF RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS OF YOGA FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS THROUGH A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE. DESIGN: TWENTY ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE SEARCHED TO IDENTIFY RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA WERE FULL-TEXT, PEER REVIEWED ARTICLES, OF RCTS WITH YOGA AS A PRIMARY INTERVENTION, ON A POPULATION AGED 18 YEARS AND OVER, WITH A CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS OF A MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITION. DATA RELATING TO STUDY CHARACTERISTICS, YOGA STYLES, YOGA PRACTICES, HOME PRACTICE, AND REPORTING WERE EXTRACTED AND SUMMARISED. RESULTS: SEVENTEEN ARTICLES MET INCLUSION CRITERIA, REPRESENTING FIVE MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS: LOW BACK PAIN, OSTEOARTHRITIS, RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, KYPHOSIS, AND FIBROMYALGIA. 15 STUDIES WERE NON-RESIDENTIAL, AND TWO WERE RESIDENTIAL. STUDY DURATION RANGED FROM 1 TO 24 WEEKS; WEEKLY DOSAGE OF YOGA RANGED FROM 1 TO 56H. FIVE STYLES OF POSTURE-BASED HATHA YOGA WERE SPECIFIED. INTERVENTION CONTENT INCLUDED SEVEN YOGA PRACTISES: POSTURES, BREATHING, RELAXATION, MEDITATION, PHILOSOPHY, CHANTING, AND CLEANSING PRACTISES. TEN STUDIES EITHER ENCOURAGED OR REQUESTED HOME PRACTICE. REPORTING DETAILS INCLUDED CLASS PLANS, POSTURE LISTS, AND DIAGRAMS. DUE TO INSUFFICIENT DETAIL REGARDING DELIVERY OF THE YOGA INTERVENTION ONLY EIGHT OF THE 17 INTERVENTIONS WERE CONSIDERED REPLICABLE AS REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS: EVALUATION OF STUDY CHARACTERISTICS AND YOGA COMPONENTS INDICATED SEVERAL AREAS OF HOMOGENEITY ACROSS STUDIES, SUGGESTING AN EXISTING DEGREE OF STANDARDISATION. HOWEVER, HETEROGENEITY RELATED TO INTERVENTION CONTENT AND REPORTING IMPEDED DETERMINATION OF INTERVENTION CONTENT AND DELIVERY. STANDARDISATION OF CONTENT, NOMENCLATURE, AND REPORTING DETAILS IS RECOMMENDED TO ENHANCE PROTOCOL TRANSPARENCY, REPLICATION, AND COMPARISON OF INTERVENTION EFFECTIVENESS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
7  259  35 ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF THE ONLINE DELIVERY OF HATHA YOGA: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE. OBJECTIVES: HATHA YOGA HAS DRAMATICALLY INCREASED IN POPULARITY IN THE UNITED STATES AND A GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE POINTS TO YOGA'S ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE BOTH PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. CONCURRENTLY, THE DELIVERY OF TELEHEALTH INTERVENTIONS ALSO CONTINUES TO RISE. THE ONLINE-DELIVERY OF YOGA LIES AT THIS INTERSECTION, AND TO DATE, NO STUDY HAS SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEWED THE EXISTING LITERATURE OF EMPIRICAL STUDIES INVOLVING THE ONLINE DELIVERY OF YOGA. DESIGN: THIS STUDY SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEWS THE LITERATURE FOR EVIDENCE ON THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF ONLINE YOGA INTERVENTIONS AND PROVIDES A QUALITATIVE SYNTHESIS. A TOTAL OF 10 ARTICLES WHICH REPRESENT EIGHT UNIQUE EMPIRICAL STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL REVIEW. RESULTS: ACROSS THE EIGHT STUDIES, PARTICIPANTS EXPRESSED OVERALL SATISFACTION WITH AN ONLINE YOGA INTERVENTION. ONLINE YOGA WAS FOUND TO BE FEASIBLE, BASED ON ATTENDANCE AND PRACTICE RATES, AND ACCEPTABLE. ALTHOUGH GROUPS VARY IN DEGREE OF INITIAL ENGAGEMENT. RESULTS ALSO FOUND PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE THAT ONLINE YOGA CAN HELP MANAGE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH A RANGE OF DISORDERS. CONCLUSIONS: UNDERSTANDING THIS INNOVATIVE APPROACH TO DELIVERING YOGA INTERVENTIONS WILL ALLOW FUTURE RESEARCH TO INCLUDE ONLINE YOGA AS A LOWER-COST, NON-INVASIVE INTERVENTION FOR A WIDE VARIETY OF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS, AS WELL AS PROVIDE PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THE INTEGRATION OF ONLINE YOGA INTERVENTIONS INTO ROUTINE CLINICAL CARE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
8 1294  27 GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPING YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR RANDOMIZED TRIALS. LITTLE GUIDANCE IS AVAILABLE TO ASSIST RESEARCHERS IN DEVELOPING TREATMENT PROTOCOLS FOR RESEARCH ON YOGA FOR HEALTH CONCERNS. BECAUSE YOGA IS A COMPLEX MULTIFACTORIAL MIND-BODY DISCIPLINE HISTORICALLY DEVELOPED FOR NONMEDICAL PURPOSES, NUMEROUS DECISIONS MUST BE MADE IN ORDER TO THOUGHTFULLY DEVELOP SUCH PROTOCOLS. IN THIS PAPER, A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH IS PROPOSED TO ASSIST RESEARCHERS IN SELECTING AN INTERVENTION THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE CONDITION UNDER CONSIDERATION AND EXPLICITLY DEVELOPED. RESEARCHERS NEED TO CONSIDER THE TYPE OR "STYLE" OF YOGA, THE COMPONENTS TO INCLUDE (E.G., BREATHING EXERCISES, POSTURES) AS WELL AS THE SPECIFIC PROTOCOL FOR EACH COMPONENT, THE DOSE TO BE DELIVERED (FREQUENCY, DURATION OF PRACTICE, AND THE TOTAL DURATION OF PRACTICE), AND ISSUES RELATED TO SELECTION OF INSTRUCTORS AND MONITORING THE FIDELITY TO THE INTERVENTION. EACH OF THESE DOMAINS AND THE KEY ISSUES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PROTOCOLS IS DISCUSSED. FINALLY, SOME AREAS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH RELATED TO PROTOCOL DEVELOPMENT ARE RECOMMENDED.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
9 2451  41 YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY APPROACH TO HEALING FOR ADULT VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE. PURPOSE: YOGA IS INCREASINGLY ACCEPTED TO IMPROVE OVERALL HEALTH AND WELLNESS AND IS CONSIDERED A MEANINGFUL ADJUNCT TREATMENT FOR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH AILMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE (IV). THIS REVIEW PROVIDES BACKGROUND INFORMATION ABOUT THE USE OF YOGA AMONG INDIVIDUALS WITH IV HISTORIES AND AIMS TO INFORM RESEARCHERS AND PRACTITIONERS ABOUT THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE ON YOGA'S APPLICATION AND EFFECTIVENESS. METHODS: USING SIX DATABASES, WE SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEWED EMPIRICAL LITERATURE EXAMINING YOGA AMONG IV SURVIVORS. CRITERIA FOR STUDY INCLUSION: YOGA INCLUDED A PHYSICAL COMPONENT AND WAS THE PRIMARY INTERVENTION; PARTICIPANTS HAD AN IV HISTORY; PEER-REVIEWED; AND PARTICIPANTS WERE 17 YEARS AND OLDER. AFTER REVIEW, 10 ARTICLES REPORTING FINDINGS FROM SEVEN INDEPENDENT SAMPLES WERE INCLUDED. FINDINGS: YOGA DEMONSTRATED PRELIMINARY, POSITIVE IMPLICATIONS AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH AN IV HISTORY. SYNTHESIZING ACROSS ARTICLES FOUR THEMES EMERGED: (1) ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY, (2) ENHANCEMENT OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH, (3) PROMOTION OF PERSONAL GROWTH, AND (4) FACILITATORS AND BARRIERS TO PRACTICE. CONCLUSIONS: THE NASCENT LITERATURE INDICATES POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF INTEGRATING YOGA INTO INTERVENTIONS FOR IV SURVIVORS TO ENHANCE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONING. THE PRIMARY BARRIERS TO INTERVENTION WERE RESOURCES (E.G., ACCESS) AND INCOMPATIBILITY WITH SPIRITUAL BELIEFS FOR SELECT CLIENTS. DESPITE CONSISTENT BARRIERS, PRELIMINARY FINDINGS INDICATE YOGA HAS MANY POSITIVE IMPLICATIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH AN IV HISTORY. GIVEN THE SMALL EVIDENCE BASE AND INSUFFICIENT METHODOLOGY, ADDITIONAL EMPIRICAL RESEARCH WITH DIVERSE SAMPLES AND SITES, AND ROBUST DESIGNS, COULD IMPROVE THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE AND STRENGTHEN THE EFFICACY OF THIS PROMISING PRACTICE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
10 2678  34 YOGA IN SCHOOL SETTINGS: A RESEARCH REVIEW. RESEARCH ON THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR IMPROVING MENTAL, EMOTIONAL, PHYSICAL, AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CHARACTERISTICS IN SCHOOL SETTINGS IS A RECENT BUT GROWING FIELD OF INQUIRY. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RESEARCH ON SCHOOL-BASED YOGA INTERVENTIONS PUBLISHED IN PEER-REVIEWED JOURNALS OFFERS A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS THAT IDENTIFIED 47 PUBLICATIONS. THE STUDIES FROM THESE PUBLICATIONS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES (N = 30) AND INDIA (N = 15) SINCE 2005, WITH THE MAJORITY OF STUDIES (N = 41) CONDUCTED FROM 2010 ONWARD. ABOUT HALF OF THE PUBLICATIONS WERE OF STUDIES AT ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS; MOST (85%) WERE CONDUCTED WITHIN THE SCHOOL CURRICULUM, AND MOST (62%) ALSO IMPLEMENTED A FORMAL SCHOOL-BASED YOGA PROGRAM. THERE WAS A HIGH DEGREE OF VARIABILITY IN YOGA INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING OVERALL DURATION, AND THE NUMBER AND DURATION OF SESSIONS. MOST OF THESE PUBLISHED RESEARCH TRIALS ARE PRELIMINARY IN NATURE, WITH NUMEROUS STUDY DESIGN LIMITATIONS, INCLUDING LIMITED SAMPLE SIZES (MEDIAN = 74; RANGE = 20-660) AND RELATIVELY WEAK RESEARCH DESIGNS (57% RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS, 19% UNCONTROLLED TRIALS), AS WOULD BE EXPECTED IN AN INFANT RESEARCH FIELD. NEVERTHELESS, THESE PUBLICATIONS SUGGEST THAT YOGA IN THE SCHOOL SETTING IS A VIABLE AND POTENTIALLY EFFICACIOUS STRATEGY FOR IMPROVING CHILD AND ADOLESCENT HEALTH AND THEREFORE WORTHY OF CONTINUED RESEARCH.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
11 2203  45 THE ESSENTIAL PROPERTIES OF YOGA QUESTIONNAIRE: DEVELOPMENT AND METHODS. YOGA INTERVENTIONS HAVE CONSIDERABLE HETEROGENEITY, ARE MULTI-DIMENSIONAL, AND MAY IMPACT HEALTH IN DIFFERENT WAYS. HOWEVER, MOST RESEARCH REPORTS REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON HEALTH AND WELLBEING DO NOT ADEQUATELY DESCRIBE THE COMPONENTS OF THE YOGA INTERVENTIONS BEING USED. THUS, DRAWING COMPARISONS ACROSS STUDIES OR UNDERSTANDING THE RELATIVE EFFECTS OF SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF A YOGA INTERVENTION ARE RARELY POSSIBLE. TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM, WE CREATED THE ESSENTIAL PROPERTIES OF YOGA QUESTIONNAIRE (EPYQ) PROJECT, AN NCCAM-FUNDED SET OF STUDIES TO DEVELOP A TRANSLATIONAL TOOL FOR YOGA RESEARCHERS. HERE WE DESCRIBE THE METHODS AND DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESSES USED IN THE EPYQ PROJECT IN DETAIL. THE PROJECT CONSISTS OF FOUR MAIN PHASES. PHASE I WAS DESIGNED TO GAIN A COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELEVANT ASPECTS OF YOGA BY CONDUCTING A COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW AND CONDUCTING FOCUS GROUPS WITH STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING A WIDE VARIETY OF YOGA TEACHERS AND STUDENTS. IN PHASE II, A POOL OF POTENTIAL QUESTIONNAIRE ITEMS WAS DEVELOPED FOR THE PROTOTYPIC QUESTIONNAIRE USING INFORMATION FROM PHASE I. COGNITIVE INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH THE PRELIMINARY EPYQ ITEMS TO ASSESS THE PERCEIVED CLARITY, MEANING, AND IMPORTANCE OF EACH ITEM. IN PHASE III, THE PROTOTYPIC QUESTIONNAIRE WAS ADMINISTERED TO TWO LARGE SAMPLES OF YOGA STUDENTS AND INSTRUCTORS. MILITARY PERSONNEL AND VETERANS WHO PRACTICED OR TAUGHT YOGA (N = 329) WERE RECRUITED TO PARTICIPATE. FACTOR ANALYSIS AND ITEM RESPONSE THEORY WERE USED TO IDENTIFY FACTORS AND SELECT THE FINAL QUESTIONNAIRE ITEMS. PHASE IV IS ONGOING AND WILL COLLECT RELIABILITY AND VALIDITY DATA ON THE FINAL INSTRUMENT. RESULTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE AVAILABLE IN 2016. THE EPYQ WILL PROVIDE AN OBJECTIVE TOOL FOR DESCRIBING THE AMOUNT OF VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS, EVENTUALLY ALLOWING RESEARCHERS TO LINK SPECIFIC YOGA COMPONENTS TO HEALTH BENEFITS, AND FACILITATING THE DESIGN OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR SPECIFIC HEALTH CONDITIONS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
12 2422  43 YOGA AND MINDFULNESS AS THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS FOR STROKE REHABILITATION: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. AIM. THIS PAPER REPORTS A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF THE EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BEHAVIORAL THERAPIES SUCH AS YOGA AND MINDFULNESS PRACTICES FOR STROKE REHABILITATION. BACKGROUND. THE EXPERIENCE OF STROKE CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON BOTH PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH AND ON QUALITY OF LIFE. YOGA AND RELEVANT PRACTICES ARE PROMISING THERAPIES THAT HAVE BEEN USED WITH PATIENTS WITH A VARIETY OF CONDITIONS. IN ORDER TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS ON EFFECTIVENESS FOR STROKE PATIENTS, THE EVIDENCE REQUIRES SYSTEMATIC ASSESSMENT. METHODS. A COMPREHENSIVE SEARCH OF MAJOR BIOMEDICAL AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE DATABASES WAS CONDUCTED. RELEVANT RESEARCH WAS CATEGORIZED BY STUDY TYPE AND APPRAISED ACCORDING TO STUDY DESIGN. RESULTS. FIVE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS AND FOUR SINGLE CASE STUDIES WERE FOUND. ADDITIONALLY, ONE QUALITATIVE RESEARCH STUDY WAS IDENTIFIED. STUDIES REPORTED POSITIVE RESULTS, INCLUDING IMPROVEMENTS IN COGNITION, MOOD, AND BALANCE AND REDUCTIONS IN STRESS. MODIFICATIONS TO DIFFERENT YOGA PRACTICES MAKE COMPARISON BETWEEN STUDIES DIFFICULT, AND A LACK OF CONTROLLED STUDIES PRECLUDES ANY FIRM CONCLUSIONS ON EFFICACY. CONCLUSION. YOGA AND MINDFULNESS COULD BE CLINICALLY VALUABLE SELF-ADMINISTERED INTERVENTION OPTIONS FOR STROKE REHABILITATION. FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO EVALUATE THESE SPECIFIC PRACTICES AND THEIR SUITABILITY IN STROKE REHABILITATION.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
13  593  33 DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF A YOGA INTERVENTION PROGRAM FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE. PRELIMINARY RESEARCH INDICATES THAT YOGA COULD BE A VALUABLE TOOL FOR PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD). HOWEVER, LITTLE HAS BEEN PUBLISHED ABOUT THE PROCESS BY WHICH THE YOGA INTERVENTIONS WERE DESIGNED AND EVALUATED. THIS STUDY ELABORATES ON THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING AND TESTING A BI-WEEKLY, 12-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM TO DETERMINE ITS SAFETY AND FEASIBILITY FOR PEOPLE WITH PD. THE LEAD YOGA TEACHER USED INPUT FROM A FOCUSED LITERATURE REVIEW TO DESIGN AN INITIAL DRAFT OF THE INTERVENTION PROGRAM. THIS DRAFT WAS REVIEWED BY A GROUP OF YOGA EXPERTS ( N = 6) TO DEVELOP THE FINAL INTERVENTION PROGRAM. THIS 12-WEEK INTERVENTION WAS IMPLEMENTED IN 19 PARTICIPANTS WITH PD (MEAN AGE 63 +/- 8, RANGE 49-75) VIA TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES. THROUGH THIS COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, A SERIES OF 24 INDIVIDUAL 1-HOUR YOGA SEQUENCES WAS CREATED. THESE SEQUENCES INCLUDED YOGA POSTURES (ASANA), BREATHING TECHNIQUES (PRANAYAMA), AND MINDFULNESS MEDITATION PRINCIPLES SPECIFICALLY CHOSEN TO ADDRESS CONCERNS UNIQUE TO THE PD POPULATION. THE FEASIBILITY OF THE PROGRAM WAS SUPPORTED WITH EXCELLENT ATTENDANCE: 90% OF PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED > 75% OF THE CLASSES, WITH FOUR PARTICIPANTS ATTENDING 100%. NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. THIS DEVELOPMENT PROCESS PRODUCED A SAFE AND ENJOYABLE YOGA PROGRAM SPECIFIC FOR THE NEEDS OF PEOPLE WITH PD. HOWEVER, THIS METHODOLOGY COULD SERVE AS A TEMPLATE FOR FUTURE STUDIES ON HOW TO DEVELOP SAFE AND EFFECTIVE YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR OTHER POPULATIONS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
14 2377  27 WHO PRACTICES YOGA? A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF DEMOGRAPHIC, HEALTH-RELATED, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA PRACTICE. YOGA HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY POPULAR IN THE US AND AROUND THE WORLD, YET BECAUSE MOST YOGA RESEARCH IS CONDUCTED AS CLINICAL TRIALS OR EXPERIMENTS, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE CHARACTERISTICS AND CORRELATES OF PEOPLE WHO INDEPENDENTLY CHOOSE TO PRACTICE YOGA. WE CONDUCTED A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THIS ISSUE, IDENTIFYING 55 STUDIES AND CATEGORIZING CORRELATES OF YOGA PRACTICE INTO SOCIODEMOGRAPHICS, PSYCHOSOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS, AND MENTAL AND PHYSICAL WELL-BEING. YOGA USE IS GREATEST AMONG WOMEN AND THOSE WITH HIGHER SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AND APPEARS FAVORABLY RELATED TO PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS SUCH AS COPING AND MINDFULNESS. YOGA PRACTICE OFTEN RELATES TO BETTER SUBJECTIVE HEALTH AND HEALTH BEHAVIORS BUT ALSO WITH MORE DISTRESS AND PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENT. HOWEVER, EVIDENCE IS SPARSE AND METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS PRECLUDE DRAWING CAUSAL INFERENCES. NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE STUDIES HAVE MINIMALLY ASSESSED YOGA WHILE STUDIES WITH STRONG ASSESSMENT OF YOGA PRACTICE (E.G., TYPE, DOSE) ARE GENERALLY CONDUCTED WITH CONVENIENCE SAMPLES. ALMOST ALL STUDIES REVIEWED ARE CROSS-SECTIONAL AND FEW CONTROL FOR POTENTIAL CONFOUNDING VARIABLES. WE PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CORRELATES OF YOGA PRACTICE.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
15 2247  34 THE INTEGRATION OF YOGA IN PHYSICAL THERAPY CLINICAL PRACTICE. HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ARE BEGINNING TO USE YOGA AS A TREATMENT MODALITY. HOWEVER, EVIDENCE EXPLAINING PHYSICAL THERAPISTS' INTEGRATION OF YOGA IN CLINICAL PRACTICE IS LACKING. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE HOW, WHY, AND WITH WHOM PHYSICAL THERAPISTS INTEGRATE YOGA INTO CLINICAL PRACTICE. DESIGN: THIS STUDY IS A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF QUALITATIVE DATA COLLECTED DURING A LARGER MULTI-METHODS STUDY. THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF 13 INTERVIEWS WAS CONDUCTED. RESULTS: ANALYSIS INDICATED FOUR THEMES, AND SIX SUBTHEMES. FACILITATING YOGA IN CLINICAL PRACTICE AND YOGA TRAINING THEMES; INCLUDING EVALUATION OF OUTCOMES, BILLING, TERMINOLOGY, AND SAFETY SUBTHEMES DESCRIBE HOW PHYSICAL THERAPISTS ARE USING YOGA IN CLINICAL PRACTICE. THE PERCEIVED CLIENT OUTCOMES THEME, INCLUDING PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES EXPLAIN WHY PHYSICAL THERAPISTS USE YOGA IN PRACTICE. THE YOGA WITH CLINICAL POPULATIONS THEME ADDRESSES WITH WHOM PHYSICAL THERAPISTS ARE USING YOGA. CONCLUSION: PHYSICAL THERAPISTS ARE USING YOGA WITH INDIVIDUALS WITH VARIOUS HEALTH CONDITIONS TO IMPROVE THEIR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH. FINDINGS SUPPORT THE NEED FOR PHYSICAL THERAPISTS TO INCREASE THEIR ASSESSMENT AND DOCUMENTATION OF FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH CLIENT'S YOGA PARTICIPATION. DOCUMENTATION COULD CONTRIBUTE TO EVIDENCE-BASED LITERATURE RELATED TO HOW, WHY, AND WITH WHOM PHYSICAL THERAPISTS ARE USING YOGA. DOCUMENTED OUTCOMES COULD ALSO PROVIDE RATIONALE FOR YOGA TO RECEIVE CLASSIFICATION AS A REIMBURSABLE COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH APPROACH. FUTURE RESEARCH INVOLVING A LARGER, DIVERSE SAMPLE (E.G., PHYSICAL THERAPISTS WITH VARYING LEVELS OF EDUCATION AND YOGA TRAINING) FOCUSED ON HOW, WHY, AND WITH WHOM PHYSICAL THERAPISTS INTEGRATE YOGA INTO CLINICAL PRACTICE IS RECOMMENDED.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
16 2426  26 YOGA AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH: INTEGRATIVE REVIEW OF INTERVENTION STUDIES. BACKGROUND: EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED IN SEVERAL FIELDS. OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE AND ANALYZE RESULTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN THE WORKPLACE REPORTED ALONG 10 YEARS AFTER THE FORMULATION OF THE NATIONAL POLICY OF INTEGRATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY PRACTICES. METHOD: WE LOCATED 10 STUDIES PUBLISHED FROM 2006 TO 2015 WHICH MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA, INCLUDED IN DATABASES CUMULATIVE INDEX OF NURSING AND ALLIED HEALTH LITERATURE (CINAHL), MEDICAL LITERATURE ANALYSES AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEM ONLINE (MEDLINE), WEB OF SCIENCE, SCOPUS, COCHRANE AND SCIENTIFIC ELECTRONIC LIBRARY ONLINE (SCIELO). ANALYZED VARIABLES WERE: PUBLICATION YEAR, AUTHORSHIP, TITLE, AIMS, RESULTS, AND CONCLUSIONS. INTERVENTIONS WERE CHARACTERIZED BASED ON YOGA STYLE, PRACTICES IMPLEMENTED, FREQUENCY AND DURATION OF SESSIONS, DURATION OF INTERVENTION, MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENTS, AND ADDITIONAL INTERVENTIONS. RESULTS: OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA HAS PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS ON WORKERS FROM DIFFERENT PROFESSIONAL CATEGORIES. HOWEVER, WE DID NOT FIND BENEFITS FOR SOME CONDITIONS, AND YOGA PRACTICE DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME POSITIVE EFFECTS ON ALL PRACTITIONERS. WORKERS' ADHERENCE TO PROGRAMS INFLUENCES THE RESULTS OF RESEARCH. MANY STUDIES DID NOT CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE IMPLEMENTED PROGRAMS. CONCLUSION: THE CHARACTERISTICS OF INTERVENTIONS SHOW SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES AMONG PROGRAMS, WHICH ENABLE A SYNTHESIS, BUT NOT COMPARISONS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
17 2453  29 YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS: A GUIDE FOR CLINICIANS. YOGA IS BEING USED BY A GROWING NUMBER OF YOUTH AND ADULTS AS A MEANS OF IMPROVING OVERALL HEALTH AND FITNESS. THERE IS ALSO A PROGRESSIVE TREND TOWARD USE OF YOGA AS A MIND-BODY COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE SPECIFIC PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. TO PROVIDE CLINICIANS WITH THERAPEUTICALLY USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT YOGA, THE EVIDENCE EVALUATING YOGA AS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH HEALTH PROBLEMS IS REVIEWED AND SUMMARIZED. A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF YOGA AND YOGA THERAPY IS PRESENTED ALONG WITH YOGA RESOURCES AND PRACTICAL STRATEGIES FOR CLINICAL PRACTITIONERS TO USE WITH THEIR PATIENTS. THE MAJORITY OF AVAILABLE STUDIES WITH CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS SUGGEST BENEFITS TO USING YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION AND SHOW VERY FEW ADVERSE EFFECTS. THESE RESULTS MUST BE INTERPRETED AS PRELIMINARY FINDINGS BECAUSE MANY OF THE STUDIES HAVE METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS THAT PREVENT STRONG CONCLUSIONS FROM BEING DRAWN. YOGA APPEARS PROMISING AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS. FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO APPLY IT MOST EFFECTIVELY AND MORE COORDINATED RESEARCH EFFORTS ARE NEEDED.	2010

CONSIDERING THE INCREASING NUMBER OF STUDIES ON YOGA INDICATING IMPROVEMENTS IN HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQL) AMONG THE ADULT ONCOLOGY POPULATION, IT IS IMPORTANT TO EXPLORE WHETHER SIMILAR BENEFITS HAVE BEEN FOUND IN PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY PATIENTS. METHODS: CINAHL, OVID MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, PUBMED, AND SCOPUS WERE SEARCHED FROM THE YEARS 2010 THROUGH 2020 FOR STUDIES ASSESSING THE USE OF YOGA IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS AFFECTED BY CANCER. CONSIDERING THE BENEFITS OF YOGA ON HRQL IN THE ADULT ONCOLOGY POPULATION, THE AIM OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO EVALUATE THE CURRENT BODY OF LITERATURE ON YOGA IN THE PEDIATRIC CANCER POPULATION. RESULTS: EIGHT STUDIES, ALL NONRANDOMIZED WITH SINGLE-ARM DESIGNS, WERE REVIEWED. FIVE OF THE STUDIES WERE DESIGNED AS FEASIBILITY STUDIES AND WHILE RECRUITMENT RATES RANGED FROM 34% TO 55%, RETENTION RATES WERE APPROXIMATELY 70%. QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK FROM PARTICIPANTS WAS VERY POSITIVE AND THEMES RELATED TO BOTH PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFITS. CERTAIN MEASURES OF HRQL (I.E., ANXIETY, PAIN, AND PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING) WERE FOUND TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED FOLLOWING A YOGA INTERVENTION. DISCUSSION: ALTHOUGH NO RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED TO DATE ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC, THE STUDIES REVIEWED SHOWED THAT DELIVERING YOGA TO THIS POPULATION IS FEASIBLE AND SAFE. ADDITIONALLY, PRELIMINARY FINDINGS ON THE IMPACT OF YOGA FOR SOME OF THE COMMON SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT-RELATED SIDE EFFECTS EXPERIENCED BY CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS AFFECTED BY CANCER ARE PROMISING.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
19 1185  36 EVIDENCE BASE OF YOGA STUDIES ON CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH: A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS. NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES INCLUDING CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE CONTRIBUTE TO APPROXIMATELY 50% OF GLOBAL MORTALITY. PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT ALONE MAY NOT BE A PANACEA FOR SUCH DISEASES SINCE IT MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH VARIOUS OTHER ADVERSE EFFECTS. HENCE, STRATEGIES SUCH AS YOGA INVOLVING HEALTHY LIFESTYLE AND STRESS MANAGEMENT ARE WIDELY SOUGHT BY THE PATIENT POPULATION. MATERIALS AND METHODS: AN ELECTRONIC SEARCH OF PUBMED AS A STANDARD BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATABASE WAS PERFORMED THROUGH FEBRUARY 2015 USING THE KEYWORDS "YOGA" AND "CARDIOVASCULAR." STUDIES WITH YOGA AS THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLE AND PARAMETERS RELATED TO CARDIAC HEALTH AS THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE WERE INCLUDED AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA WERE APPLIED. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 149 PUBLICATIONS WERE IDENTIFIED WHICH MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR ANALYSIS. OF THE TOTAL PUBLICATIONS, 44% WERE CLINICAL TRIALS OF WHICH 19% WERE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WHICH MAY BE CATEGORIZED AS HIGH-QUALITY ONES. AN UPWARD TREND IN THE OVERALL RESEARCH IN THIS AREA IS EVIDENT. MAJOR WORK HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED BY RESEARCHERS OF THE UNITED STATES (38%) AND INDIA (29%). CONCLUSION: THE SURVEY INDICATES THAT THE NUMBER OF PUBLICATIONS IN THE FIELD OF "YOGA" AND "CARDIOVASCULAR" HEALTH HAS INCREASED RAPIDLY IN THE LATE YEARS. ANALYSIS COMPRISING THE NATION/STATE HELPS DEFINE ITS STATUS WITH REGARD TO ITS COUNTERPARTS AND HELPS UNDERSTAND SCIENCE PRIORITIES AND DISEASE CONTROL STRATEGIES IN AN EFFORT TO PROVIDE COST-EFFECTIVENESS AND QUALITY CONTROL. THERE IS A NEED FOR FURTHER HIGH-QUALITY STUDIES IN THE FIELD OF "YOGA" AND "CARDIOVASCULAR" DISEASES TO VALIDATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON HEALTH PARAMETERS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
20 1280  28 GENERIC YOGA MODULES FOR CLINICAL AND RESEARCH SETTINGS-NEED OF THE HOUR. YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS OFFER SIGNIFICANT PROMISE IN HEALTHCARE. HOWEVER, META-ANALYSES OF VARIOUS YOGA TRIALS SUGGEST THAT COMPARISONS OF TRIALS ARE EITHER NOT POSSIBLE OR DIFFICULT DUE TO HETEROGENEITY IN THERAPEUTIC YOGA INTERVENTIONS. ALSO, IN VIEW OF EMERGING EVIDENCE FOR THE ROLE OF THERAPEUTIC YOGA, IT IS IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY THE SPECIFICITY AND VALIDITY OF VARIOUS YOGA COMPONENTS BEING USED IN DIFFERENT TRIALS. EFFORTS IN THIS DIRECTION WILL BE FRUITFUL ONLY IF A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH IS ADOPTED TO DEVELOP YOGA PROGRAMS FOR VARIOUS AILMENTS. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR A "GENERIC YOGA" CONCEPT FOR DESIGNING A THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM FOR PARTICULAR HEALTH ISSUES, WITH THE OBJECTIVES OF PROMOTING SCIENTIFIC GROWTH OF THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS OF YOGA AND WIDESPREAD APPLICATION OF STANDARDIZED THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAMS WITHIN A BIOMEDICAL FRAMEWORK. THIS GENERIC THERAPEUTIC YOGA WILL ESSENTIALLY HIGHLIGHT THE DEVELOPMENT-VALIDATION PROCESS OF UNCOPYRIGHTED YOGA PROGRAMS; THEIR COMPONENTS, BENEFITS, AND POSSIBLE SIDE-EFFECTS; AND REQUIREMENT FOR NEED-BASED MODIFICATIONS.	2021

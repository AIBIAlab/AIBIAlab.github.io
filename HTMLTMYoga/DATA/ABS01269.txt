1 1269 153 FRAILTY MODIFIES THE INTERVENTION EFFECT OF CHAIR YOGA ON PAIN AMONG OLDER ADULTS WITH LOWER EXTREMITY OSTEOARTHRITIS: SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF A NONPHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: IN AN 8-WEEK NONPHARMACOLOGICAL PAIN INTERVENTION TRIAL AMONG OLDER ADULTS WITH LOWER EXTREMITY OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA), WE AIMED TO EXAMINE: A) THE BASELINE FRAILTY LEVEL OF THE PARTICIPANTS; B) WHETHER SUCH INTERVENTION IS MORE BENEFICIAL FOR BASELINE FRAILER OLDER ADULTS THAN FOR THEIR COUNTERPARTS WITH LESS FRAILTY; AND C) WHETHER THE INTERVENTION COULD ALSO ALTER FRAILTY. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER CHAIR YOGA (CY) OR HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAM (HEP) GROUPS AND ATTENDED TWICE-WEEKLY 45-MINUTE CY OR HEP SESSIONS FOR 8 WEEKS. FOLLOWING A STANDARD PROCEDURE, 82 VARIABLES WERE USED TO CONSTRUCT A FRAILTY INDEX (FI, 0-1). PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE: WESTERN ONTARIO AND MCMASTER UNIVERSITIES (WOMAC) PAIN AND PAIN INTERFERENCE. LINEAR MIXED-EFFECTS MODELS WERE USED TO EVALUATE THE MODIFYING EFFECT OF BASELINE FRAILTY ON THE INTERVENTION EFFECT OF CY ON PRIMARY OUTCOMES. SIMILAR MODELS WERE USED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF CY ON FRAILTY. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 112 PARTICIPANTS (N = 63 CY, N = 49 HEP; 75.3 [SD = 7.5] YEARS) WITH 85 FEMALES (75.9%) WERE INCLUDED. THE MEAN VALUES OF BASELINE FI FOR THE CY AND HEP GROUPS WERE SIMILAR (0.428 [0.05] AND 0.433 [0.05], P = 0.355). EACH 0.01 INCREMENT IN BASELINE FI WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER WOMAC PAIN (BETA = 0.28, P < 0.001) AND PAIN INTERFERENCE (BETA = 0.51, P < 0.001). THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION EFFECT BETWEEN INTERVENTION, TIME, AND BASELINE FI (P = 0.020 FOR WOMAC PAIN; P = 0.010 FOR PAIN INTERFERENCE), INDICATING THAT PARTICIPANTS WITH HIGHER LEVEL OF BASELINE FI HAD GREATER DECLINES IN WOMAC PAIN AND PAIN INTERFERENCE. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER DECLINE IN FI FOR THE CY GROUP COMPARED TO THE HEP GROUP (BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCE - 0.01; P = 0.509) AND THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT TREND CHANGES IN FI (P FOR INTERACTION = 0.605). CONCLUSIONS: FRAILTY MODIFIES THE INTERVENTION EFFECT OF CY ON PAIN AMONG OLDER ADULTS WITH LOWER EXTREMITY OA, UNDERSCORING THE IMPORTANCE OF ASSESSING FRAILTY TO IMPROVE THE MANAGEMENT OF PAIN IN THIS POPULATION.	2020	

2  107  59 A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF THE EFFECTS OF CHAIR YOGA ON PAIN AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION AMONG COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS WITH LOWER EXTREMITY OSTEOARTHRITIS. OBJECTIVES: TO DETERMINE EFFECTS OF SIT 'N' FIT CHAIR YOGA, COMPARED TO A HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAM (HEP), ON PAIN AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION IN OLDER ADULTS WITH LOWER EXTREMITY OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) WHO COULD NOT PARTICIPATE IN STANDING EXERCISE. DESIGN: TWO-ARM RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: ONE HUD SENIOR HOUSING FACILITY AND ONE DAY SENIOR CENTER IN SOUTH FLORIDA. PARTICIPANTS: COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS (N = 131) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO CHAIR YOGA (N = 66) OR HEP (N = 65). THIRTEEN DROPPED AFTER ASSIGNMENT BUT PRIOR TO THE INTERVENTION; SIX DROPPED DURING THE INTERVENTION; 106 OF 112 COMPLETED AT LEAST 12 OF 16 SESSIONS (95% RETENTION RATE). INTERVENTIONS: PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED EITHER CHAIR YOGA OR HEP. BOTH INTERVENTIONS CONSISTED OF TWICE-WEEKLY 45-MINUTE SESSIONS FOR 8 WEEKS. MEASUREMENTS: PRIMARY: PAIN, PAIN INTERFERENCE; SECONDARY: BALANCE, GAIT SPEED, FATIGUE, FUNCTIONAL ABILITY MEASURED AT BASELINE, AFTER 4 WEEKS OF INTERVENTION, AT THE END OF THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION, AND POST-INTERVENTION (1 AND 3 MONTHS). RESULTS: THE CHAIR YOGA GROUP SHOWED GREATER REDUCTION IN PAIN INTERFERENCE DURING THE INTERVENTION (P = .01), SUSTAINED THROUGH 3 MONTHS (P = .022). WOMAC PAIN (P = .048), GAIT SPEED (P = .024), AND FATIGUE (P = .037) WERE IMPROVED IN THE YOGA GROUP DURING THE INTERVENTION (P = .048) BUT IMPROVEMENTS WERE NOT SUSTAINED POST INTERVENTION. CHAIR YOGA HAD NO EFFECT ON BALANCE. CONCLUSION: AN 8-WEEK CHAIR YOGA PROGRAM WAS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCTION IN PAIN, PAIN INTERFERENCE, AND FATIGUE, AND IMPROVEMENT IN GAIT SPEED, BUT ONLY THE EFFECTS ON PAIN INTERFERENCE WERE SUSTAINED 3 MONTHS POST INTERVENTION. CHAIR YOGA SHOULD BE FURTHER EXPLORED AS A NONPHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTION FOR OLDER PEOPLE WITH OA IN THE LOWER EXTREMITIES.

4 2825  31 YOGA VERSUS HOME EXERCISE PROGRAM IN CHILDREN WITH ENTHESITIS RELATED ARTHRITIS: A PILOT STUDY. PURPOSE: THE AIM WAS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND HOME EXERCISE PROGRAM ON LOWER EXTREMITY FUNCTIONAL STATUS, PAIN, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN CHILDREN WITH ENTHESITIS RELATED ARTHRITIS (ERA). METHODS: TWENTY-ONE CHILDREN WITH ERA WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS AS YOGA (N = 11) AND HOME EXERCISE (N = 10). YOGA GROUP PERFORMED SUPERVISED YOGA EXERCISES TWICE A WEEK FOR EIGHT WEEKS. HOME EXERCISE GROUP PERFORMED VIDEO-BASED EXERCISES FOR THE SAME PERIOD. PAIN IN REST AND ACTIVITY, LOWER EXTREMITY FUNCTIONAL STATUS, AND QUALITY OF LIFE WERE EVALUATED AT BASELINE AND FOLLOWING EIGHT WEEKS. RESULTS: THE GROUPS WERE SIMILAR AT BASELINE (P > 0.05). ALL THE PARAMETERS, EXCEPT PARENT REPORTED QUALITY OF LIFE, SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED IN YOGA GROUP (P < 0.05), WHERE ONLY STAIR CLIMB TEST TIMES SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED IN HOME EXERCISE GROUP (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: YOGA SEEMS PROMISING FOR IMPROVING LOWER EXTREMITY FUNCTIONAL STATUS, PAIN, AND QUALITY OF LIFE AS AN EXERCISE INTERVENTION IN REHABILITATION PROGRAMS OF CHILDREN WITH ERA.	2021

6  444  26 CHAIR YOGA: BENEFITS FOR COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS. THE AIM OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE WHETHER CHAIR YOGA WAS EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING PAIN LEVEL AND IMPROVING PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING IN A SAMPLE OF COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS. ONE-WAY REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE WAS PERFORMED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CHAIR YOGA AT BASELINE, MIDPOINT (4 WEEKS), AND END OF THE INTERVENTION (8 WEEKS). ALTHOUGH CHAIR YOGA WAS EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND REDUCING STIFFNESS IN OLDER ADULTS WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS, IT WAS NOT EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING PAIN LEVEL OR IMPROVING DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. FUTURE RESEARCH PLANNED BY THIS TEAM WILL USE RIGOROUS STUDY METHODS, INCLUDING LARGER SAMPLES, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS, AND FOLLOW UP FOR MONITORING HOME PRACTICE AFTER THE INTERVENTIONS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
7  459  47 CHANGES IN PAIN INTENSITY AND HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE WITH IYENGAR YOGA IN NONSPECIFIC CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. BACKGROUND: NONSPECIFIC CHRONIC LOW BACK (NCLBP) PAIN IS PREVALENT AMONG ADULT POPULATION AND OFTEN LEADS TO FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS, PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS, LOWER QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), AND HIGHER HEALTHCARE COSTS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF IYENGAR YOGA THERAPY ON PAIN INTENSITY AND HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) WITH NCLBP. AIM OF THE STUDY: TO COMPARE THE EFFECT OF IYENGAR YOGA THERAPY AND CONVENTIONAL EXERCISE THERAPY ON PAIN INTENSITY AND HRQOL IN NONSPECIFIC CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WITH RANDOM SAMPLING TECHNIQUE. SUBJECTS/INTERVENTION: SIXTY SUBJECTS WHO FULFILLED THE SELECTION CRITERIA WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO IYENGAR YOGA (YOGA GROUP, N = 30) AND CONTROL GROUP (EXERCISE GROUP, N = 30). PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED LOW BACK PAIN EVALUATION FORM AND HRQOL-4 QUESTIONNAIRE BEFORE THEIR INTERVENTION AND AGAIN 4 WEEKS AND 6 MONTH LATER. YOGA GROUP UNDERWENT 29 YOGIC POSTURES TRAINING AND EXERCISE GROUP HAD UNDERGONE GENERAL EXERCISE PROGRAM FOR 4 WEEKS. STATISTICS: REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA) WAS USED TO ANALYZE GROUP DIFFERENCES OVER TIME, WHILE CONTROLLING FOR BASELINE DIFFERENCES. RESULTS: PATIENTS IN BOTH GROUPS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PAIN AND IMPROVEMENT IN HRQOL. IN VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE (VAS) YOGA GROUP SHOWED REDUCTION OF 72.81% (P = 0.001) AS COMPARED TO EXERCISE GROUP 42.50% (P = 0.001). IN HRQOL, YOGA GROUP SHOWED REDUCTION OF 86.99% (P = 0.001) AS COMPARED TO EXERCISE GROUP 67.66% (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT IYENGAR YOGA PROVIDES BETTER IMPROVEMENT IN PAIN REDUCTION AND IMPROVEMENT IN HRQOL IN NONSPECIFIC CHRONIC BACK PAIN THAN GENERAL EXERCISE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
8  290  43 ADJUNCTIVE YOGA V. HEALTH EDUCATION FOR PERSISTENT MAJOR DEPRESSION: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER HATHA YOGA IS AN EFFICACIOUS ADJUNCTIVE INTERVENTION FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH CONTINUED DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS DESPITE ANTIDEPRESSANT TREATMENT. METHOD: WE CONDUCTED A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES (N = 63) V. HEALTH EDUCATION CLASSES (HEALTHY LIVING WORKSHOP; HLW; N = 59) IN INDIVIDUALS WITH ELEVATED DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AND ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATION USE. HLW SERVED AS AN ATTENTION-CONTROL GROUP. THE INTERVENTION PERIOD WAS 10 WEEKS, WITH FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENTS 3 AND 6 MONTHS AFTERWARDS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS DEPRESSION SYMPTOM SEVERITY ASSESSED BY BLIND RATER AT 10 WEEKS. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS OVER THE ENTIRE INTERVENTION AND FOLLOW-UP PERIODS, SOCIAL AND ROLE FUNCTIONING, GENERAL HEALTH PERCEPTIONS, PAIN, AND PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING. RESULTS: AT 10 WEEKS, WE DID NOT FIND A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS IN DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS (B = -0.82, S.E. = 0.88, P = 0.36). HOWEVER, OVER THE ENTIRE INTERVENTION AND FOLLOW-UP PERIOD, WHEN CONTROLLING FOR BASELINE, YOGA PARTICIPANTS SHOWED LOWER LEVELS OF DEPRESSION THAN HLW PARTICIPANTS (B = -1.38, S.E. = 0.57, P = 0.02). AT 6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP, 51% OF YOGA PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED A RESPONSE (50% REDUCTION IN DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS) COMPARED WITH 31% OF HLW PARTICIPANTS (ODDS RATIO = 2.31; P = 0.04). YOGA PARTICIPANTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER SOCIAL AND ROLE FUNCTIONING AND GENERAL HEALTH PERCEPTIONS OVER TIME. CONCLUSIONS: ALTHOUGH WE DID NOT SEE A DIFFERENCE IN DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AT THE END OF THE INTERVENTION PERIOD, YOGA PARTICIPANTS SHOWED FEWER DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS OVER THE ENTIRE FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. BENEFITS OF YOGA MAY ACCUMULATE OVER TIME.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
9 1841  36 QIGONG OR YOGA VERSUS NO INTERVENTION IN OLDER ADULTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN-A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. UNLABELLED: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE REDUCTION OF CHRONIC LOWER BACK PAIN IN OLDER ADULTS USING EITHER YOGA CLASSES OR QIGONG CLASSES COMPARED WITH NO INTERVENTION. OLDER ADULTS (65 YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER) WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN WERE ENROLLED IN AND RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO: 1) YOGA (24 CLASSES, 45 MINUTES EACH, DURING 3 MONTHS), 2) QIGONG (12 CLASSES, 90 MINUTES EACH, DURING 3 MONTHS), OR 3) A CONTROL GROUP WHO RECEIVED NO ADDITIONAL INTERVENTION. THE PAIN INTENSITY ITEM OF THE FUNCTIONAL RATING INDEX AFTER 3 MONTHS WAS USED AS PRIMARY OUTCOME PARAMETER. A TOTAL OF 176 PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED (N = 61 YOGA, N = 58 QIGONG, N = 57 CONTROL; MEAN AGE 73 +/- 5.6 YEARS, 89% FEMALE). THE MEAN ADJUSTED PAIN INTENSITY AFTER 3 MONTHS WAS 1.71 FOR THE YOGA GROUP (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI], 1.54-1.89), 1.67 FOR THE QIGONG GROUP (95% CI, 1.45-1.89), AND 1.89 FOR NO INTERVENTION (95% CI, 1.67-2.11). NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT GROUP DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED. POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS FOR THIS LACK OF PAIN RELIEF MIGHT INCLUDE THE INEFFECTIVENESS OF INTERVENTIONS, INAPPROPRIATE OUTCOMES, OR DIFFERENCES IN PAIN PERCEPTION AND PROCESSING IN OLDER ADULTS. PERSPECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE REDUCTION OF CHRONIC LOWER BACK PAIN IN OLDER ADULTS USING EITHER YOGA CLASSES OR QIGONG CLASSES COMPARED WITH NO INTERVENTION. THIS 3-ARMED RANDOMIZED TRIAL WITH 176 OLDER ADULTS SHOWED THAT YOGA AND QIGONG WERE NOT SUPERIOR TO NO TREATMENT IN REDUCING PAIN AND INCREASING QUALITY OF LIFE.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
10  445  25 CHAIR YOGA: FEASIBILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY STUDY WITH OLDER COMMUNITY-DWELLING ADULTS WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS. THIS STUDY MEASURED THE FEASIBILITY OF COMPLETING A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL ON AN 8-WEEK SEATED YOGA PROGRAM FOR OLDER ADULTS WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS. PART OF THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS PROGRAM WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER PARTICIPANTS WOULD CONTINUE THE YOGA PRACTICE AT HOME USING A GUIDE BOOK AFTER THE 8-WEEK PROGRAM. FINDINGS DEMONSTRATED THAT ONCE PARTICIPANTS WERE NOT IN A GROUP SETTING FOR THE YOGA, THEY DID NOT CONTINUE WITH YOGA PRACTICE. THIS OUTCOME DEMONSTRATES THE NEED FOR GROUP PROGRAMS FOR OLDER ADULTS TO PROMOTE ADHERENCE TO MOVEMENT-BASED PROGRAMS.

11 1528  45 IYENGAR YOGA FOR TREATING SYMPTOMS OF OSTEOARTHRITIS OF THE KNEES: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVES: THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RHEUMATOLOGY (ACR) GUIDELINES FOR THE MEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) EMPHASIZE THE USE OF NONPHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS INCLUDING EXERCISE. IMPLEMENTATION OF AN EXERCISE PROGRAM CAN BE DIFFICULT FOR PATIENTS, AND LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES SUCH AS YOGA. THE AIM OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY OF USING YOGA IN THE TRADITION OF B.K.S. IYENGAR TO TREAT THE SYMPTOMS OF OSTEOARTHRITIS OF THE KNEE. DESIGN: PARTICIPANTS WERE INSTRUCTED IN MODIFIED IYENGAR YOGA POSTURES DURING 90-MINUTE CLASSES ONCE WEEKLY FOR 8 WEEKS. SUBJECTS: PARTICIPANTS MET ACR CRITERIA FOR OSTEOARTHRITIS OF THE KNEE AND COMPLETED A MEDICAL HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION, WESTERN ONTARIO AND MCMASTER UNIVERSITIES OSTEOARTHRITIS INDEX (WOMAC), ARTHRITIS IMPACT MEASUREMENT SCALE 2 (AIMS2), PATIENT GLOBAL ASSESSMENT (GA) BY VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS), PHYSICIAN GA BY VAS, AND 50-FOOT WALK TIME BEFORE AND FOLLOWING AN 8-WEEK COURSE OF YOGA INSTRUCTION. ELEVEN (11) SUBJECTS ENROLLED, NINE COMPLETED AT LEAST ONE SESSION AND SEVEN (SIX OF WHOM WERE OBESE) HAD DATA FROM PRE- AND POST-COURSE TIME POINTS AVAILABLE FOR ANALYSIS. RESULTS: STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN WOMAC PAIN, WOMAC PHYSICAL FUNCTION, AND AIMS2 AFFECT WERE OBSERVED WHEN PARTICIPANTS' STATUS WERE COMPARED TO THEIR PRE-COURSE STATUS. WOMAC STIFFNESS, AIMS2 SYMPTOMS, SOCIAL AND ROLE, PHYSICIAN GA, AND PATIENT GA MEASURED TRENDS IN IMPROVEMENT OF SYMPTOMS. NO ADVERSE EVENTS FROM TREATMENT WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS: THIS PILOT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT YOGA MAY PROVIDE A FEASIBLE TREATMENT OPTION FOR PREVIOUSLY YOGA-NAIVE, OBESE PATIENTS >50 YEARS OF AGE AND OFFERS POTENTIAL REDUCTIONS IN PAIN AND DISABILITY CAUSED BY KNEE OA. FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD COMPARE YOGA TO OTHER NONPHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS FOR KNEE OA, SUCH AS PATIENT EDUCATION OR QUADRICEPS-STRENGTHENING EXERCISES.	2005	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
12 2083  35 THE EFFECT OF IYENGAR YOGA AND STRENGTHENING EXERCISES FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS OF THE KNEE: A CASE SERIES. THIS CASE SERIES DESCRIBES THE IMPACT OF VARIOUS FORMS OF EXERCISE ON SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS OF THE KNEE. A GROUP OF 15 WOMEN AND MEN PERFORMED ONE OF THE FOLLOWING: TRADITIONAL STRETCHING AND STRENGTHENING EXERCISES, IYENGAR YOGA, OR NO STRUCTURED GROUP EXERCISE. LOW BACK AND HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY AND QUADRICEPS STRENGTH AND FUNCTION WERE MONITORED BEFORE AND AFTER THE PROGRAM. THE WESTERN ONTARIO AND MCMASTER UNIVERSITIES OSTEOARTHRITIS INDEX (WOMAC) WAS USED TO ASSESS SUBJECTIVE CHANGE AFTER THE SIX-WEEK INTERVENTION PERIOD. A GLOBAL ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRE WAS ALSO COMPLETED BY EACH PARTICIPANT AND EACH INSTRUCTOR AT THE EXIT SESSIONS TO MEASURE PERCEIVED CHANGES IN IMPROVEMENTS SINCE THE INITIATION OF THE INTERVENTION. THIS STUDY FOUND FUNCTIONAL CHANGES AND IMPROVEMENT IN QUALITY OF LIFE IN TRADITIONAL EXERCISE AND A YOGA BASED APPROACH THAT SHOULD ENCOURAGE FURTHER COMPREHENSIVE AND CAREFULLY DESIGNED STUDIES OF YOGA IN OSTEOARTHRITIS.	2006	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
13  936  37 EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA VERSUS EXERCISE FOR REDUCING FALLING RISK IN OLDER ADULTS: PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL INDICES. OUR PURPOSE IN THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA TO ADDRESS MULTIPLE RISK FACTORS OF FALLING IN ACTIVE AND LOW ACTIVE OLDER ADULTS. COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS (N = 35) OVER THE AGE OF 65 ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED IN EITHER A YOGA PROGRAM, AN EXERCISE PROGRAM, OR A NO-PROGRAM CONTROL. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED MEASURES ASSOCIATED WITH FALLING RISKS. PHYSICAL MEASURES INCLUDED LOWER BODY STRENGTH, STATIC BALANCE, AND LOWER BODY FLEXIBILITY. PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASURES INCLUDED PERCEIVED SELF-EFFICACY WITH RESPECT TO FALLS AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE. WE DETERMINED BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCES USING PLANNED COMPARISONS, EFFECT SIZE, CONFIDENCE INTERVALS, AND PROBABILITY OF SUPERIORITY. RESULTS OF PLANNED COMPARISONS AND PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE TESTING INDICATED THAT YOGA PARTICIPANTS SCORED HIGHER THAN THE EXERCISE AND CONTROL PARTICIPANTS ON BOTH RIGHT AND LEFT LOWER BODY FLEXIBILITY TESTS. YOGA PARTICIPANTS ALSO SCORED HIGHER THAN THE CONTROL PARTICIPANTS ON RIGHT LEG STATIC BALANCE, AND THE RIGHT AND LEFT LOWER BODY FLEXIBILITY TESTS. THE EXERCISE PARTICIPANTS SCORED HIGHER THAN YOGA PARTICIPANTS ON THE RAND-36 QUALITY OF LIFE SUBSCALES OF ENERGY/FATIGUE, PAIN, AND GENERAL HEALTH. THE PROBABILITY OF SUPERIORITY RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE NO-PROGRAM OLDER ADULT PARTICIPANTS WOULD BENEFIT BY ENROLLING IN THE YOGA RATHER THAN THE EXERCISE PROGRAM TO REDUCE PHYSICAL RISKS OF FALLING. THESE FINDINGS WERE DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO PROMOTING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PROGRAMS TO REDUCE RISKS OF FALLING, AND THE ROLES OF THE PROTOCOL, PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE, AND MEASURES EMPLOYED WHEN DETERMINING PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
14 1242  42 FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA INTERVENTION TO DECREASE PAIN IN OLDER WOMEN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF OLDER WOMEN SUFFER FROM CHRONIC PAIN, WHICH CAN DECREASE QUALITY OF LIFE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PILOT RANDOMIZED STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF A FLOW-RESTORATIVE YOGA INTERVENTION DESIGNED TO DECREASE PAIN AND RELATED OUTCOMES AMONG WOMEN AGED 60 OR OLDER. METHODS: FLOW-RESTORATIVE YOGA CLASSES WERE HELD TWICE WEEKLY FOR 1 HOUR AND LED BY A CERTIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTOR. PARTICIPANTS RANDOMIZED TO THE INTERVENTION GROUP ATTENDED THE YOGA CLASSES FOR 12 WEEKS AND RECEIVED SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS FOR AT-HOME PRACTICE. THOSE RANDOMIZED TO THE CONTROL GROUP WERE ASKED TO MAINTAIN THEIR NORMAL DAILY ROUTINE. FEASIBILITY WAS EVALUATED USING RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION RATES, CLASS AND HOME PRACTICE ADHERENCE RATES, AND PARTICIPANT SATISFACTION SURVEYS. OUTCOME MEASURES (SELF-REPORTED PAIN, INFLAMMATORY MARKERS, FUNCTIONAL FITNESS, QUALITY OF LIFE, RESILIENCE, AND SELF-REPORTED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY) WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION. PAIRED T-TESTS OR WILCOXON SIGNED-RANK TESTS WERE USED TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN OUTCOME MEASURES WITHIN TREATMENT GROUPS. RESULTS: THIRTY-EIGHT PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED. PARTICIPANTS WERE PRIMARILY WHITE, COLLEGE-EDUCATED, AND HIGHER FUNCTIONING, DESPITE EXPERIENCING VARIOUS FORMS OF CHRONIC PAIN. ATTENDANCE AND RETENTION RATES WERE HIGH (91 AND 97%, RESPECTIVELY) AND THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS WERE SATISFIED WITH THE YOGA PROGRAM (89%) AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS (87%). INTERVENTION PARTICIPANTS ALSO EXPERIENCED REDUCTIONS IN PAIN INTERFERENCE AND IMPROVEMENTS IN ENERGY AND SOCIAL FUNCTIONING. CONCLUSIONS: THIS PILOT STUDY PROVIDES ESSENTIAL DATA TO INFORM A FULL SCALE RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF FLOW-RESTORATIVE YOGA FOR OLDER WOMEN WITH CHRONIC PAIN. FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD EMPHASIZE STRATEGIES TO RECRUIT A MORE DIVERSE STUDY POPULATION, PARTICULARLY OLDER WOMEN AT HIGHER RISK OF DISABILITY AND FUNCTIONAL DECLINE.

15 1839  35 PSYCHOSOCIAL CORRELATES AND OUTCOMES OF YOGA OR WALKING AMONG OLDER ADULTS. FEW RESEARCHERS HAVE COMPARED PSYCHOLOGICAL CORRELATES AND OUTCOMES OF YOGA WITH MORE TRADITIONAL FORMS OF EXERCISE. THE AUTHORS' PRIMARY AIM WAS TO COMPARE CHANGES IN THE PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES OF MOOD AND STATE ANXIETY PRODUCED BY AN ACUTE BOUT OF YOGA OR WALKING AMONG OLDER ADULTS. THE SECONDARY AIM WAS TO COMPARE SELECTED PSYCHOSOCIAL CORRELATES OF ACTIVITY. PARTICIPANTS WERE 51 ADULTS WHO WERE 50 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER WHO WALKED FOR EXERCISE OR PARTICIPATED IN A YOGA CLASS. RESULTS REVEALED THAT YOGA PARTICIPANTS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER LEVELS OF DEPRESSION AND PERCEIVED BARRIERS TO EXERCISE, AND LOWER QUALITY OF LIFE THAN DID WALKERS. WITH CONTROL FOR THESE DIFFERENCES, YOGA PRACTITIONERS HAD IMPROVED LEVELS OF FATIGUE PRE- TO POSTSESSION, COMPARED WITH WALKERS. WITH CONTROL FOR DIFFERENCES IN DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES, THESE CHANGES WERE NO LONGER SIGNIFICANT. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT YOGA PRACTITIONERS SEEK OUT MINDFUL-BASED EXERCISE TO COPE WITH GREATER LEVELS OF DEPRESSION AND LOWER LEVELS OF QUALITY OF LIFE.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
16 2681  51 YOGA IN SEDENTARY ADULTS WITH ARTHRITIS: EFFECTS OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PRAGMATIC TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF INTEGRAL-BASED HATHA YOGA IN SEDENTARY PEOPLE WITH ARTHRITIS. METHODS: THERE WERE 75 SEDENTARY ADULTS AGED 18+ YEARS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA) OR KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO 8 WEEKS OF YOGA (TWO 60-MIN CLASSES AND 1 HOME PRACTICE/WK) OR WAITLIST. POSES WERE MODIFIED FOR INDIVIDUAL NEEDS. THE PRIMARY ENDPOINT WAS PHYSICAL HEALTH [MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY SHORT FORM-36 (SF-36) PHYSICAL COMPONENT SUMMARY (PCS)] ADJUSTED FOR BASELINE; EXPLORATORY ADJUSTED OUTCOMES INCLUDED FITNESS, MOOD, STRESS, SELF-EFFICACY, SF-36 HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL), AND RA DISEASE ACTIVITY. IN EVERYONE COMPLETING YOGA, WE EXPLORED LONGTERM EFFECTS AT 9 MONTHS. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS WERE MOSTLY FEMALE (96%), WHITE (55%), AND COLLEGE-EDUCATED (51%), WITH A MEAN (SD) AGE OF 52 YEARS (12 YRS). AVERAGE DISEASE DURATION WAS 9 YEARS AND 49% HAD RA. AT 8 WEEKS, YOGA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PCS (6.5, 95% CI 2.0-10.7), WALKING CAPACITY (125 M, 95% CI 15-235), POSITIVE AFFECT (5.2, 95% CI 1.4-8.9), AND LOWER CENTER FOR EPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDIES DEPRESSION SCALE (-3.0, 95% CI -4.8 - -1.3). SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS (P < 0.05) WERE EVIDENT IN SF-36 ROLE PHYSICAL, PAIN, GENERAL HEALTH, VITALITY, AND MENTAL HEALTH SCALES. BALANCE, GRIP STRENGTH, AND FLEXIBILITY WERE SIMILAR BETWEEN GROUPS. TWENTY-TWO OUT OF 28 IN THE WAITLIST GROUP COMPLETED YOGA. AMONG ALL YOGA PARTICIPANTS, SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.05) IMPROVEMENTS WERE OBSERVED IN MEAN PCS, FLEXIBILITY, 6-MIN WALK, AND ALL PSYCHOLOGICAL AND MOST HRQOL DOMAINS AT 8 WEEKS WITH MOST STILL EVIDENT 9 MONTHS LATER. OF 7 ADVERSE EVENTS, NONE WERE ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA. CONCLUSION: PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE SUGGESTS YOGA MAY HELP SEDENTARY INDIVIDUALS WITH ARTHRITIS SAFELY INCREASE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND IMPROVE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH AND HRQOL.

17 2187  53 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH: A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: UNIVERSITIES AROUND THE WORLD ARE FACING AN EPIDEMIC OF MENTAL DISTRESS AMONG THEIR STUDENTS. THE PROBLEM IS TRULY A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE, AFFECTING MANY AND WITH SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES. THE GLOBAL BURDEN OF DISEASE-AGENDA CALLS FOR EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS WITH LASTING EFFECTS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE MENTAL HEALTH OF YOUNG ADULTS. IN THIS STUDY WE AIMED TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOGA, A POPULAR AND WIDELY AVAILABLE MIND-BODY PRACTICE, CAN IMPROVE STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH. METHODS: WE PERFORMED A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH 202 HEALTHY UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN THE OSLO AREA. THE PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSIGNED TO A YOGA GROUP OR WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP IN A 1:1 RATIO BY A SIMPLE ONLINE RANDOMISATION PROGRAM. THE INTERVENTION GROUP WAS OFFERED 24 YOGA SESSIONS OVER 12 WEEKS. MEASUREMENTS WERE TAKEN AT WEEK 0 (BASELINE), WEEK 12 (POST-INTERVENTION), AND WEEK 24 (FOLLOW-UP). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS ASSESSED BY THE HSCL-25 QUESTIONNAIRE. ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED BASED ON THE INTENTION TO TREAT-PRINCIPLE. RESULTS: BETWEEN 24 JANUARY 2017, AND 27 AUGUST 2017, WE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED 202 STUDENTS TO A YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 100), OR WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 102). COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP, THE YOGA PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DISTRESS SYMPTOMS BOTH AT POST-INTERVENTION (ADJUSTED DIFFERENCE IN THE MEAN CHANGE -0.15, 95% CI -0.26 TO -0.03, P = 0.0110) AND FOLLOW-UP (ADJUSTED DIFFERENCE IN THE MEAN CHANGE -0.18, 95% CI -0.29 TO -0.06, P = 0.0025). SLEEP QUALITY ALSO IMPROVED AT POST-INTERVENTION AND FOLLOW-UP. NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS: OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA HAS A MODERATELY LARGE AND LASTING EFFECT, AT LEAST FOR SOME MONTHS, REDUCING SYMPTOMS OF DISTRESS AND IMPROVING SLEEP QUALITY AMONG STUDENTS. FURTHER RESEARCH SHOULD SEEK WAYS TO ENHANCE THE EFFECT, ASSESS AN EVEN LONGER FOLLOW-UP PERIOD, INCLUDE ACTIVE CONTROL GROUPS, AND CONSIDER PERFORMING SIMILAR STUDIES IN OTHER CULTURAL SETTINGS.TRIAL REGISTRATION: CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT04258540.	2020	
                                                                                     
18 2603  37 YOGA FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN IN A COMMUNITY-BASED SETTING: A FEASIBILITY AND PILOT RCT. THE PURPOSE OF THIS FEASIBILITY PILOT STUDY WAS TO ASSESS BENEFITS OF 8 WEEKS OF YOGA IN PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED BASELINE ASSESSMENTS AND WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA OR USUAL CARE. YOGA WAS OFFERED TWICE A WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS. WE ASSESSED FEASIBILITY AND THE BRIEF PAIN INVENTORY (BPI) WAS THE PRIMARY OUTCOME, ASSESSING PAIN-SEVERITY AND PAIN INTERFERENCE ON DAILY ACTIVITIES. EIGHTY-THREE PEOPLE WERE RECRUITED; 67 PEOPLE COMPLETED THE STUDY AND WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSES. AVERAGE AGE OF PARTICIPANTS WAS 50.78 +/- 10.43 YEARS AND MOST PARTICIPANTS HAD PAIN >10 YEARS. THE INTERVENTION APPEARED FEASIBLE AND THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS (P < .05) IN MULTIPLE MEASURES FOR THE YOGA GROUP, INCLUDING A DECREASE IN BPI INTERFERENCE SCORES FROM 7.15 +/- 1.70 TO 6.14 +/- 2.21 (P = .007). THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN BODY RESPONSIVENESS AND PAIN MANAGEMENT SCORES BETWEEN GROUPS AT 8 WEEKS. IT APPEARS THAT YOGA WAS FEASIBLE AND POSITIVELY INFLUENCED MULTIPLE OUTCOME MEASURES FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
19 1825  42 PSYCHOLOGICAL ADJUSTMENT AND SLEEP QUALITY IN A RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF THE EFFECTS OF A TIBETAN YOGA INTERVENTION IN PATIENTS WITH LYMPHOMA. BACKGROUND: RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT STRESS-REDUCTION PROGRAMS TAILORED TO THE CANCER SETTING HELP PATIENTS COPE WITH THE EFFECTS OF TREATMENT AND IMPROVE THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE. YOGA, AN ANCIENT EASTERN SCIENCE, INCORPORATES STRESS-REDUCTION TECHNIQUES THAT INCLUDE REGULATED BREATHING, VISUAL IMAGERY, AND MEDITATION AS WELL AS VARIOUS POSTURES. THE AUTHORS EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF THE TIBETAN YOGA (TY) PRACTICES OF TSA LUNG AND TRUL KHOR, WHICH INCORPORATE CONTROLLED BREATHING AND VISUALIZATION, MINDFULNESS TECHNIQUES, AND LOW-IMPACT POSTURES IN PATIENTS WITH LYMPHOMA. METHODS: THIRTY-NINE PATIENTS WITH LYMPHOMA WHO WERE UNDERGOING TREATMENT OR WHO HAD CONCLUDED TREATMENT WITHIN THE PAST 12 MONTHS WERE ASSIGNED TO A TY GROUP OR TO A WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP. PATIENTS IN THE TY GROUP PARTICIPATED IN 7 WEEKLY YOGA SESSIONS, AND PATIENTS IN THE WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP WERE FREE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE TY PROGRAM AFTER THE 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENT. RESULTS: EIGHTY NINE PERCENT OF TY PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED AT LEAST 2-3 THREE YOGA SESSIONS, AND 58% COMPLETED AT LEAST 5 SESSIONS. PATIENTS IN THE TY GROUP REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER SLEEP DISTURBANCE SCORES DURING FOLLOW-UP COMPARED WITH PATIENTS IN THE WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP (5.8 VS. 8.1; P < 0.004). THIS INCLUDED BETTER SUBJECTIVE SLEEP QUALITY (P < 0.02), FASTER SLEEP LATENCY (P < 0.01), LONGER SLEEP DURATION (P < 0.03), AND LESS USE OF SLEEP MEDICATIONS (P < 0.02). THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS IN TERMS OF INTRUSION OR AVOIDANCE, STATE ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, OR FATIGUE. CONCLUSIONS: THE PARTICIPATION RATES SUGGESTED THAT A TY PROGRAM IS FEASIBLE FOR PATIENTS WITH CANCER AND THAT SUCH A PROGRAM SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES SLEEP-RELATED OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS FOR THE OTHER OUTCOMES.	2004

OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE EFFECT OF A SHORT-TERM INTENSIVE RESIDENTIAL YOGA PROGRAM WITH PHYSICAL EXERCISE (CONTROL) ON PAIN AND SPINAL FLEXIBILITY IN SUBJECTS WITH CHRONIC LOW-BACK PAIN (CLBP). DESIGN: THIS WAS A WAIT-LIST, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. SETTING: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT A RESIDENTIAL INTEGRATIVE HEALTH CENTER IN BANGALORE, SOUTH INDIA. SUBJECTS: EIGHTY (80) SUBJECTS (FEMALES, N = 37) WITH CLBP, WHO CONSENTED WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO RECEIVE YOGA OR PHYSICAL EXERCISE IF THEY SATISFIED THE SELECTION CRITERIA. INTERVENTION: THE INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF A 1-WEEK INTENSIVE RESIDENTIAL YOGA PROGRAM COMPRISED OF ASANAS (PHYSICAL POSTURES) DESIGNED FOR BACK PAIN, PRANAYAMAS (BREATHING PRACTICES), MEDITATION, AND DIDACTIC AND INTERACTIVE SESSIONS ON PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPTS OF YOGA. THE CONTROL GROUP PRACTICED PHYSICAL EXERCISES UNDER A TRAINED PHYSIATRIST AND ALSO HAD DIDACTIC AND INTERACTIVE SESSIONS ON LIFESTYLE CHANGE. BOTH OF THE GROUPS WERE MATCHED FOR TIME ON INTERVENTION AND ATTENTION. OUTCOME MEASURES: PAIN-RELATED OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED BY THE OSWESTRY DISABILITY INDEX (ODI) AND BY SPINAL FLEXIBILITY, WHICH WAS ASSESSED USING GONIOMETER AT PRE AND POST INTERVENTION. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (RMANOVA). RESULTS: DATA CONFORMED TO A GAUSSIAN DISTRIBUTION. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN ODI SCORES IN THE YOGA GROUP COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP (P = 0.01; EFFECT SIZE 1.264). SPINAL FLEXIBILITY MEASURES IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY IN BOTH GROUPS BUT THE YOGA GROUP HAD GREATER IMPROVEMENT AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS ON SPINAL FLEXION (P = 0.008; EFFECT SIZE 0.146), SPINAL EXTENSION (P = 0.002; EFFECT SIZE 0.251), RIGHT LATERAL FLEXION (P = 0.059; EFFECT SIZE 0.006); AND LEFT LATERAL FLEXION (P = 0.006; EFFECT SIZE 0.171). CONCLUSIONS: SEVEN (7) DAYS OF A RESIDENTIAL INTENSIVE YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE PROGRAM REDUCED PAIN-RELATED DISABILITY AND IMPROVED SPINAL FLEXIBILITY IN PATIENTS WITH CLBP BETTER THAN A PHYSICAL EXERCISE REGIMEN.	2008

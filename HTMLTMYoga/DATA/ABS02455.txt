1 2455 191 YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR SMOKING CESSATION: RESULTS FROM BREATHEASY, A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT YOGA MAY BE HELPFUL AS AN AID FOR SMOKING CESSATION. YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE STRESS AND NEGATIVE MOOD AND MAY AID WEIGHT CONTROL, ALL OF WHICH HAVE PROVEN TO BE BARRIERS TO QUITTING SMOKING. THIS STUDY IS THE FIRST RIGOROUS, RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL OF YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR SMOKERS ATTEMPTING TO QUIT. METHODS: ADULT SMOKERS (N = 227; 55.5% WOMEN) WERE RANDOMIZED TO AN 8-WEEK PROGRAM OF COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL SMOKING CESSATION AND EITHER TWICE-WEEKLY IYENGAR YOGA OR GENERAL WELLNESS CLASSES (CONTROL). ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED COTININE-VERIFIED 7-DAY POINT PREVALENCE ABSTINENCE AT WEEK 8, 3-MONTH, AND 6-MONTH FOLLOW-UPS. RESULTS: AT BASELINE, PARTICIPANTS' MEAN AGE WAS 46.2 (SD = 12.0) YEARS AND SMOKING RATE WAS 17.3 (SD = 7.6) CIGARETTES/DAY. LONGITUDINALLY ADJUSTED MODELS OF ABSTINENCE OUTCOMES DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT GROUP EFFECTS FAVORING YOGA. YOGA PARTICIPANTS HAD 37% GREATER ODDS OF ACHIEVING ABSTINENCE THAN WELLNESS PARTICIPANTS AT THE END OF TREATMENT (EOT). LOWER BASELINE SMOKING RATES (</=10 CIGARETTES/DAY) WERE ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER LIKELIHOOD OF QUITTING IF GIVEN YOGA VERSUS WELLNESS (OR = 2.43, 95% CI = 1.09% TO 6.30%) CLASSES AT EOT. A SIGNIFICANT DOSE EFFECT WAS OBSERVED FOR YOGA (OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.09% TO 1.26%), BUT NOT WELLNESS, SUCH THAT EACH YOGA CLASS ATTENDED INCREASED QUITTING ODDS AT EOT BY 12%. LATENT CLASS MODELING REVEALED A 4-CLASS MODEL OF DISTINCT QUITTING PATTERNS AMONG PARTICIPANTS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA APPEARS TO INCREASE THE ODDS OF SUCCESSFUL SMOKING ABSTINENCE, PARTICULARLY AMONG LIGHT SMOKERS. ADDITIONAL WORK IS NEEDED TO IDENTIFY PREDICTORS OF QUITTING PATTERNS AND INFORM ADJUSTMENTS TO THERAPY NEEDED TO ACHIEVE CESSATION AND PREVENT RELAPSE. IMPLICATIONS: THIS STUDY ADDS TO OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE TYPES OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THAT AID SMOKING CESSATION. YOGA INCREASES THE ODDS OF SUCCESSFUL SMOKING ABSTINENCE, AND DOES SO IN A DOSE-RESPONSE MANNER. THIS STUDY ALSO REVEALED FOUR DISTINCT PATTERNS OF SMOKING BEHAVIOR AMONG PARTICIPANTS RELEVANT TO QUITTING SMOKING. ADDITIONAL WORK IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE WHETHER VARIABLES THAT ARE PREDICTIVE OF THESE QUITTING PATTERNS CAN BE IDENTIFIED, WHICH MIGHT SUGGEST MODIFICATIONS TO THERAPY FOR THOSE WHO ARE UNABLE TO QUIT.	2019	

2 2456  72 YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR SMOKING CESSATION IN WOMEN. BACKGROUND: TOBACCO SMOKING REMAINS THE LEADING PREVENTABLE CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG AMERICAN WOMEN. AEROBIC EXERCISE HAS SHOWN PROMISE AS AN AID TO SMOKING CESSATION BECAUSE IT IMPROVES AFFECT AND REDUCES NICOTINE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS. STUDIES OUTSIDE THE REALM OF SMOKING CESSATION HAVE SHOWN THAT YOGA PRACTICE ALSO REDUCES PERCEIVED STRESS AND NEGATIVE AFFECT. METHODS: THIS PILOT STUDY EXAMINES THE FEASIBILITY AND INITIAL EFFICACY OF YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR SMOKING CESSATION. FIFTY-FIVE WOMEN WERE GIVEN 8-WEEK GROUP-BASED COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR SMOKING CESSATION AND WERE RANDOMIZED TO A TWICE-WEEKLY PROGRAM OF VINYASA YOGA OR A GENERAL HEALTH AND WELLNESS PROGRAM (CONTACT CONTROL). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS 7-DAY POINT PREVALENCE ABSTINENCE AT THE END OF TREATMENT VALIDATED BY SALIVA COTININE TESTING. LONGITUDINAL ANALYSES WERE ALSO CONDUCTED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF INTERVENTION ON SMOKING CESSATION AT 3- AND 6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF THE INTERVENTION ON POTENTIAL MEDIATING VARIABLES (E.G., CONFIDENCE IN QUITTING SMOKING, SELF-EFFICACY), AS WELL AS MEASURES OF DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, ANXIETY, AND PERCEIVED HEALTH (SF-36). RESULTS: AT END OF TREATMENT, WOMEN IN THE YOGA GROUP HAD A GREATER 7-DAY POINT-PREVALENCE ABSTINENCE RATE THAN CONTROLS (ODDS RATIO [OR], 4.56; 95% CI, 1.1-18.6). ABSTINENCE REMAINED HIGHER AMONG YOGA PARTICIPANTS THROUGH THE SIX MONTH ASSESSMENT (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 0.34-6.92), ALTHOUGH DIFFERENCES WERE NO LONGER STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. WOMEN PARTICIPATING IN THE YOGA PROGRAM ALSO SHOWED REDUCED ANXIETY AND IMPROVEMENTS IN PERCEIVED HEALTH AND WELL-BEING WHEN COMPARED WITH CONTROLS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA MAY BE AN EFFICACIOUS COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR SMOKING CESSATION AMONG WOMEN.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
3 2457  66 YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR SMOKING CESSATION: RATIONALE, STUDY DESIGN AND PARTICIPANT CHARACTERISTICS OF THE QUITTING-IN-BALANCE STUDY. BACKGROUND: TOBACCO SMOKING REMAINS THE LEADING PREVENTABLE CAUSE OF DEATH AMONG AMERICAN WOMEN. EXERCISE HAS SHOWN PROMISE AS AN AID TO SMOKING CESSATION BECAUSE IT REDUCES WEIGHT GAIN AND WEIGHT CONCERNS, IMPROVES AFFECT, AND REDUCES NICOTINE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS AND CIGARETTE CRAVING. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE PRACTICE OF YOGA IMPROVES WEIGHT CONTROL, AND REDUCES PERCEIVED STRESS AND NEGATIVE AFFECT. YOGA PRACTICE ALSO INCLUDES REGULATION OF BREATHING AND FOCUSED ATTENTION, BOTH OF WHICH MAY ENHANCE STRESS REDUCTION AND IMPROVE MOOD AND WELL-BEING AND MAY IMPROVE CESSATION OUTCOMES. METHODS/DESIGN: THIS PILOT EFFICACY STUDY IS DESIGNED TO EXAMINE THE RATES OF CESSATION AMONG WOMEN RANDOMIZED TO EITHER A NOVEL, 8-WEEK YOGA PLUS COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT) SMOKING CESSATION INTERVENTION VERSUS A WELLNESS PROGRAM PLUS THE SAME CBT SMOKING CESSATION INTERVENTION. OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDE 7-DAY POINT PREVALENCE ABSTINENCE AT END OF TREATMENT, 3 AND 6 MONTHS FOLLOW UP AND POTENTIAL MEDIATING VARIABLES (E.G., CONFIDENCE IN QUITTING SMOKING, SELF-EFFICACY). OTHER ASSESSMENTS INCLUDE MEASURES OF MINDFULNESS, SPIRITUALITY, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, ANXIETY AND PERCEIVED HEALTH (SF-36). DISCUSSION: INNOVATIVE TREATMENTS ARE NEEDED THAT ADDRESS BARRIERS TO SUCCESSFUL SMOKING CESSATION AMONG MEN AND WOMEN. THE DESIGN CHOSEN FOR THIS STUDY WILL ALLOW US TO EXPLORE POTENTIAL MEDIATORS OF INTERVENTION EFFICACY SO THAT WE MAY BETTER UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISM(S) BY WHICH YOGA MAY ACT AS AN EFFECTIVE COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR SMOKING CESSATION. IF SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE, YOGA CAN OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL EXERCISE FOR REDUCING NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS THAT OFTEN ACCOMPANY SMOKING CESSATION AND PREDICT RELAPSE TO SMOKING AMONG RECENT QUITTERS.

4 2376  60 WHO ENROLLS IN A QUIT SMOKING PROGRAM WITH YOGA THERAPY? OBJECTIVES: YOGA MAY IMPROVE STRESS, AFFECT, AND WEIGHT CONTROL, ALL OF WHICH ARE COMMONLY CITED BARRIERS TO QUITTING SMOKING. HOWEVER, THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE CONCERNS MAY VARY BY SEX, RACE, ETHNICITY, AND AGE. WE EXAMINED SMOKING-RELEVANT CHARACTERISTICS OF INDIVIDUALS ENROLLING IN AN 8-WEEK RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL TESTING YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT TO STANDARD SMOKING CESSATION. METHODS: OF 958 CALLERS, 227 WERE ELIGIBLE AND ENROLLED. RESULTS: THE SAMPLE WAS 55% FEMALE, 86% NON-HISPANIC WHITE, WITH A MEAN AGE OF 46 YEARS (SD = 12). MALES SMOKED MORE CIGARETTES/ DAY THAN FEMALES AND HAD LOWER MOTIVATION TO QUIT SMOKING. FEMALES WERE MORE LIKELY TO SMOKE FOR WEIGHT CONTROL, SOCIAL AND MOOD-RELATED REASONS, AND HAD HIGHER EXPECTATIONS FOR THE EFFICACY OF YOGA. AGE WAS NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRESENCE OF OTHER SMOKERS IN THE HOUSEHOLD, AND SMOKING IN RESPONSE TO NEGATIVE MOODS, AND WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH SMOKING RATE, AND CONFIDENCE IN QUITTING. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT BOTH MALES AND FEMALES WERE INTERESTED IN A PROGRAM OFFERING YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR SMOKING CESSATION. HOWEVER, THERE WERE BOTH SEX AND AGE-RELATED DIFFERENCES WITH RESPECT TO SMOKING-RELATED VARIABLES THAT MAY SUGGEST A NEED TO ADAPT THE INTERVENTION FOR SUB-POPULATIONS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
5 2039  72 TESTING THE EFFICACY OF YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR SMOKING CESSATION: DESIGN AND METHODS OF THE BREATHEASY TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: SMOKERS TRYING TO QUIT ENCOUNTER MANY CHALLENGES INCLUDING NICOTINE WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS, CIGARETTE CRAVING, INCREASED STRESS AND NEGATIVE MOOD AND CONCERN REGARDING WEIGHT GAIN. THESE PHENOMENA MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO SUCCESSFULLY QUIT SMOKING. STUDIES IN NON-SMOKING POPULATIONS SHOW THAT YOGA REDUCES STRESS AND NEGATIVE MOOD AND IMPROVES WEIGHT CONTROL. BY INCREASING MINDFULNESS WE ANTICIPATE THAT YOGA MAY ALSO IMPROVE SMOKERS' ABILITY TO COPE WITH THE NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH QUITTING. YOGA MAY ALSO IMPROVE COGNITIVE DELIBERATION WHICH IS NEEDED TO MAKE EFFECTIVE CHOICES AND AVOID SMOKING IN TEMPTING SITUATIONS. METHODS/DESIGN: THE BREATHEASY STUDY IS A RIGOROUS, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL EXAMINING THE EFFICACY OF IYENGAR YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY TO COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR SMOKING CESSATION. ALL PARTICIPANTS ARE GIVEN AN 8-WEEK PROGRAM OF SMOKING CESSATION CLASSES, AND ARE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER TWICE WEEKLY YOGA (YOGA) OR TWICE-WEEKLY HEALTH AND WELLNESS CLASSES WHICH SERVE AS A CONTROL FOR CONTACT AND PARTICIPANT BURDEN (CTL). ASSESSMENTS ARE CONDUCTED AT BASELINE, 8 WEEKS, 3, 6, AND 12 MONTHS OF FOLLOW-UP. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME IS PROLONGED ABSTINENCE USING AN INTENTION-TO-TREAT APPROACH. MULTIPLE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL AUDITS USING BLIND DATA COLLECTION ARE EMPLOYED TO ENSURE TREATMENT FIDELITY AND RELIABILITY OF STUDY RESULTS. TO UNDERSTAND WHY YOGA MAY BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN CTL, WE WILL EXAMINE THE MECHANISMS OF ACTION (I.E., MEDIATORS) UNDERLYING INTERVENTION EFFICACY. WE WILL EXAMINE THE MAINTENANCE OF YOGA PRACTICE AND SMOKING STATUS AT EACH FOLLOW-UP. FOCUS GROUPS AND INTERVIEWS WILL BE USED TO ENRICH OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF YOGA PRACTICE AND SMOKING ABSTINENCE. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY WILL PROVIDE A STRINGENT TEST OF THE RELATIVE EFFICACY OF YOGA COMPARED TO A CONDITION THAT CONTROLS FOR CONTACT TIME AND ATTENTION. THE USE OF MIXED METHODOLOGY ALSO PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY TO VALIDATE EXISTING KNOWLEDGE ABOUT YOGA AND HELPS TO EXPLORE NEW THEMES FOR FUTURE MINDFULNESS AND YOGA RESEARCH.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                       
6   16  52 "SMOKING DOES NOT GO WITH YOGA:" A QUALITATIVE STUDY OF WOMEN'S PHENOMENOLOGICAL PERCEPTIONS DURING YOGA AND SMOKING CESSATION. INTRODUCTION: SMOKING CESSATION IS OFTEN ACCOMPANIED BY WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS, CIGARETTE CRAVING, INCREASED NEGATIVE AFFECT, AND INCREASED EXPERIENCE OF STRESS. BECAUSE YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE STRESS AND NEGATIVE AFFECT, IT MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE AID TO SMOKING CESSATION. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE WOMEN'S PHENOMENOLOGICAL EXPERIENCES OF VINYASA YOGA AS PART OF A SMOKING CESSATION PROGRAM. METHODS: FOCUS GROUPS WERE CONDUCTED POST-INTERVENTION WITH WOMEN (N = 20) WHO PARTICIPATED IN A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR SMOKING CESSATION. THE 8-WEEK VINYASA YOGA INTERVENTION INCLUDED TWICE WEEKLY 60-MINUTE CLASSES THAT INVOLVED BREATHING EXERCISES, POSTURES (ASANAS), AND RELAXATION TECHNIQUES. FOCUS GROUPS WERE AUDIO RECORDED AND TRANSCRIBED. THEMATIC ANALYSIS FOCUSED ON DESCRIPTIONS OF YOGA, BREATHING, AND BODILY SENSATIONS INCLUDING CIGARETTE CRAVING. RESULTS: FOCUS GROUP PARTICIPANTS DESCRIBED VINYASA YOGA AS PHYSICALLY CHALLENGING. MOST REPORTED DELIBERATE USE OF YOGIC BREATHING TO COPE WITH CIGARETTE CRAVING AND STRESS. OTHER PERCEIVED EFFECTS INCLUDED RELAXATION AND AN INCREASED SENSE OF BODY AWARENESS AND WELLBEING. CONCLUSIONS: PARTICIPANTS VIEWED YOGA AS POSITIVE AND POTENTIALLY HELPFUL FOR QUITTING SMOKING. YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE ADJUNCT FOR SMOKING CESSATION.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
7 2046  56 THE ACUTE IMPACT OF HATHA YOGA ON CRAVING AMONG SMOKERS ATTEMPTING TO REDUCE OR QUIT. INTRODUCTION: DESPITE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF SMOKING, SMOKERS HAVE DIFFICULTY QUITTING, SUGGESTING A NEED FOR ADDITIONAL STRATEGIES TO HELP THEM QUIT. A SINGLE-SESSION HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION ACUTELY REDUCED CRAVING AMONG NICOTINE-DEPRIVED SMOKERS NOT ATTEMPTING TO REDUCE OR QUIT, YET IT IS UNKNOWN IF IT REDUCES CRAVING AMONG THOSE ATTEMPTING TO CHANGE THEIR SMOKING. THUS, THIS STUDY TESTED THE EFFICACY OF A SINGLE-SESSION HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION FOR ACUTELY REDUCING CRAVING AMONG SMOKERS ATTEMPTING TO REDUCE OR QUIT SMOKING. METHODS: DATA PRESENTED ARE PART OF A LARGER DISSERTATION PROJECT. PARTICIPANTS WERE 55 COMMUNITY-RECRUITED SMOKERS (62% MALE) MOTIVATED TO REDUCE OR QUIT SMOKING RANDOMIZED TO ONE SESSION OF HATHA YOGA (N = 25) OR WELLNESS CONTROL (IE, READING EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS ABOUT HEALTHY LIFESTYLE; N = 30) ON THEIR INTERVENTION DAY (IE, THE DAY ON WHICH THEY BEGAN TO REDUCE OR QUIT SMOKING). PARTICIPANTS RATED, "I HAVE A DESIRE FOR A CIGARETTE RIGHT NOW," ON A 7-POINT LIKERT SCALE IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION. RESULTS: AFTER STATISTICALLY CONTROLLING FOR CO IN BREATH, PARTICIPANT TYPE, AGE, GENDER, RACE, AND ETHNICITY, A SIGNIFICANT TIME X CONDITION INTERACTION WAS FOUND, F(1, 47) = 4.72, P = .035, ETAP2 = .09, SUGGESTING CRAVING DECREASED AT A GREATER RATE IN THE HATHA YOGA CONDITION RELATIVE TO THE WELLNESS CONDITION. CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS FROM THIS STUDY ADD TO A GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH DEMONSTRATING THE POTENTIAL CLINICAL UTILITY OF HATHA YOGA AS AN ADJUNCTIVE INTERVENTION TOOL FOR SMOKING CESSATION. IMPLICATIONS: THIS IS THE FIRST KNOWN STUDY TO TEST THE IMPACT OF A SINGLE-SESSION HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION ON CRAVING AMONG ADULT SMOKERS ATTEMPTING TO REDUCE OR QUIT SMOKING. WE FOUND THAT 30 MINUTES OF HATHA YOGA PRODUCED A GREATER REDUCTION IN CRAVING COMPARED TO A 30-MINUTE WELLNESS CONTROL CONDITION. THIS RELATIONSHIP WAS EVIDENT EVEN AFTER STATISTICALLY ACCOUNTING FOR OTHER IMPORTANT VARIABLES (EG, GENDER). RESULTS OF THIS STUDY ADD TO A GROWING BODY OF LITERATURE DEMONSTRATING THE POTENTIAL CLINICAL UTILITY OF HATHA YOGA AS AN ADJUNCTIVE INTERVENTION STRATEGY FOR SMOKING CESSATION.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                 
8  265  48 ACUTE EFFECTS OF AEROBIC EXERCISE AND HATHA YOGA ON CRAVING TO SMOKE. INTRODUCTION: RECENT STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ON CRAVING TO SMOKE AND SMOKING WITHDRAWAL. THE CURRENT STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO COMPARE AND CONTRAST THE EFFECTS OF 2 DIFFERENT FORMS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ON GENERAL AND CUE-ELICITED CRAVING TO SMOKE. METHODS: FOLLOWING 1-HR NICOTINE ABSTINENCE, 76 DAILY SMOKERS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO ENGAGE IN A 30-MIN BOUT OF CARDIOVASCULAR EXERCISE (CE; BRISK WALK ON A TREADMILL), HATHA YOGA (HY), OR A NONACTIVITY CONTROL CONDITION. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED MEASURES OF CRAVING AND MOOD, AND A SMOKING CUE REACTIVITY ASSESSMENT, BEFORE, IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING, AND APPROXIMATELY 20 MIN AFTER THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OR CONTROL CONDITIONS. RESULTS: COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL CONDITION, PARTICIPANTS IN EACH OF THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY GROUPS REPORTED A DECREASE IN CRAVING TO SMOKE, AN INCREASE IN POSITIVE AFFECT, AND A DECREASE IN NEGATIVE AFFECT. IN ADDITION, CRAVING IN RESPONSE TO SMOKING CUES WAS SPECIFICALLY REDUCED AMONG THOSE WHO ENGAGED IN CE, WHEREAS THOSE WHO ENGAGED IN HY REPORTED A GENERAL DECREASE IN CRAVINGS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY PROVIDES FURTHER SUPPORT FOR THE USE OF EXERCISE BOUTS FOR ATTENUATING CIGARETTE CRAVINGS DURING TEMPORARY NICOTINE ABSTINENCE. RESULTS ALSO SUGGEST THAT CE CAN ATTENUATE CRAVINGS IN RESPONSE TO SMOKING CUES. THERE ARE SEVERAL AREAS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH THAT MAY IMPROVE INTEGRATION OF EXERCISE WITHIN SMOKING CESSATION TREATMENT.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
9  627  40 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN ENROLLING IN SMOKING CESSATION PROGRAMS USING YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY. THIS STUDY COMPARES THE CHARACTERISTICS OF MEN AND WOMEN, RESPECTIVELY, PARTICIPATING IN TWO RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDIES WHOSE PRIMARY AIMS WERE TO TEST THE FEASIBILITY OF YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR SMOKING CESSATION. PARTICIPANTS WERE AGED 18-65, GENERALLY HEALTHY AND WERE DAILY SMOKERS. ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA) AND CHI-SQUARE TESTS EXAMINED GENDER DIFFERENCES IN SMOKING RATE, POTENTIAL TREATMENT MEDIATORS, AND COVARIATES (E.G., SMOKING HISTORY, HEALTH STATUS, WEIGHT CONCERNS, MOOD, AND PRIOR WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS). A TOTAL OF 55 WOMEN AND 38 MEN PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN AT ENROLLMENT INCLUDED: WOMEN REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER WITHDRAWAL (P<0.005), ANXIETY (P=0.032), AND DEPRESSION (P=0.027) SYMPTOMS THAN MEN. MORE WOMEN THAN MEN (91% VS. 66%) REPORTED HAVING BEEN TOLD BY THEIR DOCTOR TO QUIT SMOKING (P=0.003), HAD AN EXISTING SMOKING-RELATED ILLNESS (33% VS. 13%; P=0.032), AND REPORTED SMOKING FOR WEIGHT CONTROL (15% VS. 0%; P=0.014). RESULTS SHOWED GOOD FEASIBILITY FOR RECRUITING BOTH MEN AND WOMEN INTO A STUDY USING YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR SMOKING CESSATION. RESULTS ALSO INDICATE THAT INTERVENTIONS MAY NEED TO BE TAILORED TO MEET DIFFERENT NEEDS (E.G., ADDRESSING CO-MORBID DEPRESSION) BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
10 1786  46 PREDICTORS OF YOGA USE AMONG PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. OBJECTIVE: EMERGING RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT YOGA MAY BE BENEFICIAL FOR REDUCING SYMPTOMS AND IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE AMONG BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. HOWEVER, VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE CHARACTERISTICS OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WHO USE YOGA; THUS, THIS STUDY SEEKS TO IDENTIFY THE SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA USERS AMONG THIS POPULATION. DESIGN: A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY STUDY WAS CONDUCTED. SETTING: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT AN OUTPATIENT BREAST ONCOLOGY CLINIC AT A LARGE UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL. PARTICIPANTS: THREE HUNDRED POSTMENOPAUSAL BREAST CANCER PATIENTS CURRENTLY RECEIVING AROMATASE INHIBITORS WERE INCLUDED IN THIS STUDY. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: SELF-REPORTED USE OF YOGA FOLLOWING THE CANCER DIAGNOSIS WAS COLLECTED ALONG WITH SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL DATA. MULTIVARIATE LOGISTIC REGRESSION WAS USED TO IDENTIFY INDEPENDENT PREDICTORS OF YOGA USE AMONG BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. RESULTS: OF 300 PARTICIPANTS, 53 (17.7%) REPORTED HAVING USED YOGA FOLLOWING CANCER DIAGNOSIS. WHITE PATIENTS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO USE YOGA THAN NONWHITE PATIENTS (P = .02). HIGHER EDUCATION LEVEL, LOWER BMI (BODY MASS INDEX), PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT STATUS, PREVIOUS CHEMOTHERAPY, AND RADIATION THERAPY WERE ALL ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER YOGA USE (ALL P < .05). CONTROLLING FOR OTHER FACTORS, GREATER YOGA USE WAS INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER EDUCATION LEVEL (ADJUSTED ODDS RATIO [AOR] 2.72, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI], 1.15-6.46), AND LOWER BMI (AOR 0.25, 95% CI, 0.09-0.66). CONCLUSION: YOGA USE FOLLOWING BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSIS WAS SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER FOR WHITE PATIENTS AND THOSE WITH LOWER BMI AND HIGHER EDUCATION LEVELS. CONSIDERING ITS POTENTIAL BENEFITS FOR SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT IN CANCER, MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND THE ATTITUDES AND BARRIERS TO YOGA USE AMONG INDIVIDUALS WITH NONWHITE RACE, LOWER EDUCATION, AND HIGHER BMI LEVEL. SUCH INVESTIGATION WILL HELP DESIGN YOGA PROGRAMS THAT ARE ALIGNED TO THE NEEDS OF THESE POPULATIONS.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
11 1707  45 PATTERNS OF YOGA PRACTICE AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOLLOWING A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR ADULTS WITH OR AT RISK FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES. BACKGROUND: THE CURRENT STUDY DESCRIBED PATTERNS OF YOGA PRACTICE AND EXAMINED DIFFERENCES IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OVER TIME BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS WITH OR AT RISK FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES WHO COMPLETED AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION COMPARED WITH CONTROLS. METHODS: A LONGITUDINAL COMPARATIVE DESIGN MEASURED THE EFFECT OF A YOGA INTERVENTION ON YOGA PRACTICE AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, USING DATA AT BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION MONTHS 3, 6, AND 15. RESULTS: DISPARATE PATTERNS OF YOGA PRACTICE OCCURRED BETWEEN INTERVENTION AND CONTROL PARTICIPANTS OVER TIME, BUT THE SUBJECTIVE DEFINITION OF YOGA PRACTICE LIMITS INTERPRETATION. MULTILEVEL MODEL ESTIMATES INDICATED THAT TREATMENT GROUP DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE IN THE RATE OF CHANGE IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OVER THE STUDY PERIOD. WHILE AGE AND EDUCATION WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT INDIVIDUAL PREDICTORS, THE INCLUSION OF THESE VARIABLES IN THE MODEL DID IMPROVE FIT. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS INDICATE THAT AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OVER TIME. FURTHER RESEARCH IS NECESSARY TO EXPLORE THE INFLUENCE OF YOGA ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OUTCOMES AMONG INDIVIDUALS WITH OR AT RISK FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
12 1183  48 EVALUATION OF YOGA FOR PREVENTING ADOLESCENT SUBSTANCE USE RISK FACTORS IN A MIDDLE SCHOOL SETTING: A PRELIMINARY GROUP-RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. ADOLESCENCE IS A KEY DEVELOPMENTAL PERIOD FOR PREVENTING SUBSTANCE USE INITIATION, HOWEVER PREVENTION PROGRAMS SOLELY PROVIDING EDUCATIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE DANGERS OF SUBSTANCE USE RARELY CHANGE ADOLESCENT SUBSTANCE USE BEHAVIORS. RECENT RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT MIND-BODY PRACTICES SUCH AS YOGA MAY HAVE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON SEVERAL SUBSTANCE USE RISK FACTORS, AND THAT THESE PRACTICES MAY SERVE AS PROMISING INTERVENTIONS FOR PREVENTING ADOLESCENT SUBSTANCE USE. THE PRIMARY AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR REDUCING SUBSTANCE USE RISK FACTORS DURING EARLY ADOLESCENCE. SEVENTH-GRADE STUDENTS IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED BY CLASSROOM TO RECEIVE EITHER A 32-SESSION YOGA INTERVENTION (N = 117) IN PLACE OF THEIR REGULAR PHYSICAL EDUCATION CLASSES OR TO CONTINUE WITH PHYSICAL-EDUCATION-AS-USUAL (N = 94). PARTICIPANTS (63.2 % FEMALE; 53.6 % WHITE) COMPLETED PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION QUESTIONNAIRES ASSESSING EMOTIONAL SELF-REGULATION, PERCEIVED STRESS, MOOD IMPAIRMENT, IMPULSIVITY, SUBSTANCE USE WILLINGNESS, AND ACTUAL SUBSTANCE USE. PARTICIPANTS ALSO COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRES AT 6-MONTHS AND 1-YEAR POST-INTERVENTION. RESULTS REVEALED THAT PARTICIPANTS IN THE CONTROL CONDITION WERE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE WILLING TO TRY SMOKING CIGARETTES IMMEDIATELY POST-INTERVENTION THAN PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA CONDITION. IMMEDIATE PRE- TO POST-INTERVENTION DIFFERENCES DID NOT EMERGE FOR THE REMAINING OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP ANALYSES REVEALED A PATTERN OF DELAYED EFFECTS IN WHICH FEMALES IN THE YOGA CONDITION, AND MALES IN THE CONTROL CONDITION, DEMONSTRATED IMPROVEMENTS IN EMOTIONAL SELF-CONTROL. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT SCHOOL-BASED YOGA MAY HAVE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS WITH REGARD TO PREVENTING MALES' AND FEMALES' WILLINGNESS TO SMOKE CIGARETTES, AS WELL AS IMPROVING EMOTIONAL SELF-CONTROL IN FEMALES. HOWEVER ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS REQUIRED, PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO THE POTENTIAL LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS IN SCHOOL SETTINGS. THE PRESENT STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE LITERATURE ON ADOLESCENCE BY EXAMINING SCHOOL-BASED YOGA AS A NOVEL PREVENTION PROGRAM FOR SUBSTANCE USE RISK FACTORS.	2017	
                                                                                   
13 1851  47 RAJA YOGA MEDITATION AND MEDICATION-ASSISTED TREATMENT FOR RELAPSE PREVENTION: A PILOT STUDY. THE CONTINUED NEED FOR ADVANCEMENT IN EVIDENCE-BASED SUD TREATMENT, AS WELL AS INCREASES IN TREATMENT EXPENSE AND DECLINE IN SUPPORT FROM INSURANCE PROVIDERS, SUGGEST THAT BRIEF, INNOVATIVE, AND AFFORDABLE TREATMENTS ARE NEEDED. MEDITATION, SPIRITUALITY, AND ADHERENCE TO MEDICATION-ASSISTED TREATMENTS HAVE ALL BEEN SHOWN TO SUPPORT ABSTINENCE. THE CURRENT TRIAL ASSESSED EFFECTS OF SPIRITUALLY-BASED MEDITATION, VERSUS RELAXATION OR STANDARD TREATMENT, ON SUBSTANCE ABSTINENCE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AND DYSFUNCTION IN A PARTIALLY BUPRENORPHINE-SUPPORTED (41.5%) TREATMENT SAMPLE. PARTICIPANTS (N=40) WERE RECRUITED FROM AN INTENSIVE OUTPATIENT TREATMENT PROGRAM, IN WHICH THREE TREATMENT LOCATIONS ACTED AS SEPARATE EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS. ABSTINENCE WAS MEASURED THROUGH URINALYSES AT BASELINE AND WEEKLY THEREAFTER FOR THE DURATION OF THE INTERVENTION. PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AND DYSFUNCTION WERE ASSESSED WITH A LIKERT-SCALED QUESTIONNAIRE MEASURING SYMPTOMS TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH SUD. CO-VARYING FOR BUPRENORPHINE USE, PARTICIPANTS IN THE MEDITATION CONDITION HAD BETTER ODDS OF REMAINING ABSTINENT THAN PARTICIPANTS IN THE TREATMENT-AS-USUAL (TAU) AND RELAXATION CONDITIONS. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN SUBSTANCE ABSTINENCE BETWEEN THE RELAXATION AND TAU CONDITIONS. FURTHER, CO-VARYING OUT BASELINE THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AT POST-COURSE IN PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AND DYSFUNCTION BETWEEN THE THREE CONDITIONS. RESULTS FROM THIS PILOT TRIAL SUGGEST THAT THIS SPIRITUALLY-INFORMED APPROACH MAY OFFER ADDITIVE SUPPORT TO INDIVIDUALS IN SUD TREATMENT, AS AN AID TO THE MEDITATIVE ASPECT OF THE 12 STEPS, OR A NON-12-STEP ALTERNATIVE SPIRITUAL SUPPLEMENT TO STANDARD SUD TREATMENT.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
14 2187  53 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH: A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: UNIVERSITIES AROUND THE WORLD ARE FACING AN EPIDEMIC OF MENTAL DISTRESS AMONG THEIR STUDENTS. THE PROBLEM IS TRULY A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE, AFFECTING MANY AND WITH SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES. THE GLOBAL BURDEN OF DISEASE-AGENDA CALLS FOR EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS WITH LASTING EFFECTS THAT HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE THE MENTAL HEALTH OF YOUNG ADULTS. IN THIS STUDY WE AIMED TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOGA, A POPULAR AND WIDELY AVAILABLE MIND-BODY PRACTICE, CAN IMPROVE STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH. METHODS: WE PERFORMED A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH 202 HEALTHY UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN THE OSLO AREA. THE PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSIGNED TO A YOGA GROUP OR WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP IN A 1:1 RATIO BY A SIMPLE ONLINE RANDOMISATION PROGRAM. THE INTERVENTION GROUP WAS OFFERED 24 YOGA SESSIONS OVER 12 WEEKS. MEASUREMENTS WERE TAKEN AT WEEK 0 (BASELINE), WEEK 12 (POST-INTERVENTION), AND WEEK 24 (FOLLOW-UP). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS ASSESSED BY THE HSCL-25 QUESTIONNAIRE. ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED BASED ON THE INTENTION TO TREAT-PRINCIPLE. RESULTS: BETWEEN 24 JANUARY 2017, AND 27 AUGUST 2017, WE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED 202 STUDENTS TO A YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 100), OR WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 102). COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP, THE YOGA PARTICIPANTS DEMONSTRATED A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN DISTRESS SYMPTOMS BOTH AT POST-INTERVENTION (ADJUSTED DIFFERENCE IN THE MEAN CHANGE -0.15, 95% CI -0.26 TO -0.03, P = 0.0110) AND FOLLOW-UP (ADJUSTED DIFFERENCE IN THE MEAN CHANGE -0.18, 95% CI -0.29 TO -0.06, P = 0.0025). SLEEP QUALITY ALSO IMPROVED AT POST-INTERVENTION AND FOLLOW-UP. NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS: OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA HAS A MODERATELY LARGE AND LASTING EFFECT, AT LEAST FOR SOME MONTHS, REDUCING SYMPTOMS OF DISTRESS AND IMPROVING SLEEP QUALITY AMONG STUDENTS. FURTHER RESEARCH SHOULD SEEK WAYS TO ENHANCE THE EFFECT, ASSESS AN EVEN LONGER FOLLOW-UP PERIOD, INCLUDE ACTIVE CONTROL GROUPS, AND CONSIDER PERFORMING SIMILAR STUDIES IN OTHER CULTURAL SETTINGS.TRIAL REGISTRATION: CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT04258540.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
15 2613  49 YOGA FOR RISK REDUCTION OF METABOLIC SYNDROME: PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES FROM A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY. LIFESTYLE CHANGE IS RECOMMENDED AS TREATMENT FOR ADULTS AT RISK FOR METABOLIC SYNDROME (METS), ALTHOUGH ADOPTION OF NEW BEHAVIORAL PATTERNS IS LIMITED. IN ADDITION, MOST EXISTING LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS DO NOT ADDRESS PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS OR QUALITY OF LIFE, BOTH OF WHICH IMPACT THE BURDEN OF METS. YOGA, A FORM OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THAT INCORPORATES PSYCHOLOGICAL COMPONENTS (E.G., MAINTAINING ATTENTION, RELAXATION), IS A PROMISING INTERVENTION FOR IMPROVING THE BURDEN OF METS. THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL ASSESSED THE FEASIBILITY AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF A 12-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM COUPLED WITH AN EVIDENCE-BASED HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAM (HED) COMPARED TO HED ALONE. A SECONDARY, EXPLORATORY AIM EXAMINED PERCEIVED STRESS, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND RELATED PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES (MINDFULNESS, PERCEIVED HEALTH COMPETENCE, AND MOOD). SIXTY-SEVEN ADULTS AT RISK FOR METS ENROLLED (MEAN AGE [SD]: 58 [10] YEARS; 50% MALE; 79% NON-HISPANIC WHITE). PRELIMINARY RESULTS REVEALED SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER IMPROVEMENTS IN TWO QUALITY OF LIFE DOMAINS (ROLE-PHYSICAL AND GENERAL HEALTH PERCEPTIONS) IN THE HED PLUS YOGA GROUP VERSUS HED ALONE (PS < 0.05). THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY THAT IMPLEMENTED LIFESTYLE EDUCATION ALONG WITH YOGA TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL UNIQUE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PARTICIPANTS AT RISK FOR METS. A LARGER CLINICAL TRIAL IS WARRANTED TO FURTHER INVESTIGATE THESE PROMISING PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
16 1788  48 PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE THAT YOGA PRACTICE PROGRESSIVELY IMPROVES MOOD AND DECREASES STRESS IN A SAMPLE OF UK PRISONERS. OBJECTIVES. IN THE FIRST RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA ON UK PRISONERS, WE PREVIOUSLY SHOWED THAT YOGA PRACTICE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED MENTAL WELLBEING AND COGNITION. HERE, WE AIMED TO ASSESS HOW CLASS ATTENDANCE, SELF-PRACTICE, AND DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS WERE RELATED TO OUTCOME AMONGST PRISONERS ENROLLED IN THE 10-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. METHODS. THE DATA OF 55 PARTICIPANTS (52 MALE, 3 FEMALE) WHO COMPLETED A 10-WEEK YOGA COURSE WERE ANALYSED. CHANGES IN PRE- AND POSTYOGA MEASURES OF AFFECT, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS WERE ENTERED INTO LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSES WITH BIAS-CORRECTED AND ACCELERATED BOOTSTRAP CONFIDENCE INTERVALS. CLASS ATTENDANCE, SELF-PRACTICE, DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES, AND BASELINE PSYCHOMETRIC VARIABLES WERE INCLUDED AS REGRESSORS. RESULTS. PARTICIPANTS WHO ATTENDED MORE YOGA CLASSES AND THOSE WHO ENGAGED IN FREQUENT (5 TIMES OR MORE) SELF-PRACTICE REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER DECREASES IN PERCEIVED STRESS. DECREASES IN NEGATIVE AFFECT WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO HIGH FREQUENCY SELF-PRACTICE AND GREATER CLASS ATTENDANCE AT A NEAR-SIGNIFICANT LEVEL. AGE WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH YOGA CLASS ATTENDANCE, AND HIGHER LEVELS OF EDUCATION WERE ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER DECREASES IN NEGATIVE AFFECT. CONCLUSIONS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THERE MAY BE PROGRESSIVE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA WITHIN PRISON POPULATIONS AND POINT TO SUBPOPULATIONS WHO MAY BENEFIT THE MOST FROM THIS PRACTICE.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
17 2837  45 YOGA'S IMPACT ON RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS FOR DISORDERED EATING: A PILOT PREVENTION TRIAL. YOGA HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS A STRATEGY FOR IMPROVING RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS FOR EATING DISORDERS, BUT FEW PREVENTION TRIALS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF A YOGA SERIES IN FEMALE COLLEGE STUDENTS (N = 52). PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO A YOGA INTERVENTION (THREE 50-MINUTE YOGA CLASSES/WEEK FOR 10 WEEKS CONDUCTED BY CERTIFIED YOGA TEACHERS WHO RECEIVED A 3-DAY INTENSIVE TRAINING) OR A CONTROL GROUP. RISK AND PROTECTIVE FACTORS, ASSESSED AT BASELINE, 5 AND 10 WEEKS, INCLUDED BODY DISSATISFACTION, NEGATIVE AFFECT, LONELINESS, SELF-COMPASSION, POSITIVE AFFECT, AND MINDFULNESS. MIXED MODELS CONTROLLING FOR BASELINE LEVELS OF OUTCOME VARIABLES WERE RUN. ON AVERAGE, PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED 20 OUT OF 30 YOGA CLASSES, AND THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS REPORTED HIGH LEVELS OF SATISFACTION WITH THE YOGA SERIES. APPEARANCE ORIENTATION DECREASED AND POSITIVE AFFECT INCREASED IN THE YOGA GROUP RELATIVE TO THE CONTROL GROUP. AFTER CONTROLLING FOR BASELINE LEVELS, THE YOGA GROUP HAD A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER POSITIVE AFFECT THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. CHANGES IN OTHER OUTCOMES WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT, AS COMPARED TO THE CONTROL CONDITION. FUTURE YOGA RESEARCH DIRECTIONS ARE DISCUSSED INCLUDING EDUCATION ABOUT BODY IMAGE, MEASURE AND SAMPLE SELECTION, AND USE OF AN IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE FRAMEWORK.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
18 2579  40 YOGA FOR HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN ADULT CANCER: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED FEASIBILITY STUDY. AN INCREASE IN PATIENT-LED UPTAKE OF COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN ADULT CANCER HAS LED TO A NEED FOR MORE RIGOROUS STUDY OF SUCH INTERVENTIONS AND THEIR OUTCOMES. THIS STUDY THEREFORE AIMED TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF A YOGA INTERVENTION IN MEN AND WOMEN RECEIVING CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT FOR A CANCER DIAGNOSIS. PROSPECTIVE, MIXED METHODS FEASIBILITY TRIAL ALLOCATED PARTICIPANTS TO RECEIVE ONE OF THREE YOGA INTERVENTIONS OVER A FOUR-WEEK STUDY PERIOD. DATA COLLECTION WAS COMPLETED THROUGH ONLINE SURVEY OF QOL-CA/CS AND CUSTOMIZED SURVEYS. FIFTEEN PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED (11 FEMALE) UNDERGOING TREATMENT FOR BREAST, PROSTATE, COLORECTAL, BRAIN, AND BLOOD AND LUNG CANCER. TWO PARTICIPANTS DROPPED OUT AND COMPLETE QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DATA SETS WERE COLLECTED FROM 12 PARTICIPANTS AND FOUR YOGA INSTRUCTORS. OTHER OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED IMPLEMENTATION COSTS PATIENT-REPORTED PREFERENCES FOR YOGA INTERVENTION AND CHANGES IN QOL-CA/CS. THREE TYPES OF YOGA INTERVENTION WERE SAFELY ADMINISTERED IN ADULT CANCER. MIXED METHODS, COST-EFFICIENCY, QOL-CA/CS, AND EVIDENCE-BASED DESIGN OF YOGA INTERVENTION HAVE BEEN USED TO ESTABLISH FEASIBILITY AND PATIENT-PREFERENCES FOR YOGA DELIVERY IN ADULT CANER. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT, WITH SOME METHODOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS, A LARGE-SCALE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IS WARRANTED TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR MALE AND FEMALE CANCER PATIENTS.

19  719  49 EFFECT OF IYENGAR YOGA ON MENTAL HEALTH OF INCARCERATED WOMEN: A FEASIBILITY STUDY. BACKGROUND: INCARCERATED WOMEN SHARE A DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN OF MENTAL ILLNESS. ALTHOUGH PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO WOMEN IN PRISON, ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT MODALITIES, SUCH AS IYENGAR YOGA, MAY INCREASE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING. OBJECTIVES: THE PURPOSES OF THIS STUDY WERE (A) TO ADDRESS THE FEASIBILITY OF PROVIDING A GENDER-RESPONSIVE EXERCISE INTERVENTION WITHIN A CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION AND (B) TO OBSERVE THE EFFECT OF A GROUP-FORMAT IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM THAT MET TWO SESSIONS A WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS ON LEVELS OF DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS, ANXIETY SYMPTOMS, AND PERCEIVED STRESS AMONG INCARCERATED WOMEN. METHODS: A REPEATED MEASURES DESIGN, IN WHICH EACH PARTICIPANT SERVED AS HER OWN CONTROL, WAS USED. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THREE SELF-ADMINISTERED INSTRUMENTS: THE BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY, THE BECK ANXIETY INVENTORY, AND THE PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE BEFORE TREATMENT (BASELINE) AND DURING TREATMENT (WEEKS 4, 8, AND 12). LINEAR MIXED EFFECTS MODELS WERE USED TO EXAMINE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN MENTAL HEALTH MEASURES OVER TIME, TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ALL AVAILABLE DATA. RESULTS: ALTHOUGH 21 WOMEN INITIALLY PARTICIPATED IN THE INTERVENTION, 6 WOMEN COMPLETED THE 12-WEEK INTERVENTION. A SIGNIFICANT LINEAR DECREASE WAS DEMONSTRATED IN SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION OVER TIME, WITH MEAN VALUES CHANGING FROM 24.90 AT BASELINE TO 5.67 AT WEEK 12. THERE WAS A MARGINALLY SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN ANXIETY OVER TIME (12.00 AT BASELINE TO 7.33 AT WEEK 12) AND A NONLINEAR CHANGE IN STRESS OVER TIME, WITH DECREASES FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 4 AND SUBSEQUENT INCREASES TO WEEK 12. DISCUSSION: WOMEN WHO PARTICIPATED IN THIS PROGRAM EXPERIENCED FEWER SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY OVER TIME. FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY MAY BE USED TO IMPROVE FUTURE INTERVENTIONS FOCUSING ON THE HEALTH OUTCOMES OF INCARCERATED WOMEN.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
20 1784  46 PREDICTORS OF PREFERENCE FOR COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT) AND YOGA INTERVENTIONS AMONG OLDER ADULTS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE A PERSON'S CHOICE OF COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT) OR YOGA, THE STABILITY OF THESE PREFERENCES, AND THE IMPACT OF PREFERENCE ON ENGAGEMENT AND PROCESS MEASURES. WE CONDUCTED A RANDOMIZED PREFERENCE TRIAL OF CBT AND YOGA IN 500 ADULTS >/=60 YEARS WITH SYMPTOMS OF WORRY. PARTICIPANTS REPORTED THEIR INTERVENTION PREFERENCE, STRENGTH OF PREFERENCE, AND FACTORS IMPACTING PREFERENCE. ENGAGEMENT IN THE INTERVENTION (SESSION COMPLETION AND DROPOUT RATES) WAS ASSESSED. PROCESS MEASURES INCLUDED SATISFACTION WITH THE INTERVENTION, THERAPEUTIC ALLIANCE, AND INTERVENTION EXPECTANCY. NEITHER INTERVENTION PREFERENCE (48% AND 52% CHOSE CBT AND YOGA, RESPECTIVELY) NOR STRENGTH OF PREFERENCE DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN THE TWO PREFERENCE TRIAL GROUPS. INTERVENTION EXPECTANCIES AT BASELINE AMONG THOSE IN THE PREFERENCE TRIAL WERE APPROXIMATELY 4.5 UNITS (40-POINT SCALE) HIGHER FOR THEIR PREFERRED INTERVENTION (P < .0001 WITHIN EACH GROUP). A PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS OF FACTORS INFLUENCING PREFERENCE IDENTIFIED THREE CONSTRUCTS. USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION, COMPONENTS FOCUSED ON ATTITUDES ABOUT CBT OR YOGA WERE PREDICTIVE OF ULTIMATE PREFERENCE (ODDS RATIO = 11.5, 95% C.I.6.3-21.0 PER 1SD DIFFERENCE IN COMPONENT 1 FOR CHOOSING CBT; ODDS RATIO = 7.8, 95% CI4.3-13.9 PER 1SD DIFFERENCE IN COMPONENT 2 FOR CHOOSING YOGA). THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RANDOMIZED AND PREFERENCE TRIALS ON INTERVENTION ADHERENCE, COMPLETION OF ASSESSMENTS, INTERVENTION SATISFACTION, OR WORKING ALLIANCE. RECEIVING A PREFERRED TREATMENT HAD NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON INTERVENTION OUTCOMES THROUGH PARTICIPANT ENGAGEMENT OR PROCESS MEASURES. WHEN OPTIONS ARE LIMITED, PROVIDERS MAY HAVE CONFIDENCE IN OFFERING THE MOST READILY AVAILABLE NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENTS.	2021

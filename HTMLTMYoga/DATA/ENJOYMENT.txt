1 1781 138 PREDICTORS OF AND BARRIERS TO ADHERENCE IN A 16-WEEK RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF BIKRAM YOGA IN STRESSED AND SEDENTARY ADULTS. BACKGROUND: BIKRAM YOGA MAY ENHANCE HEALTH OUTCOMES IN HEALTHY ADULTS AND THOSE AT RISK FOR CHRONIC DISEASE, HOWEVER, CHALLENGES REMAIN IN ACHIEVING OPTIMAL ADHERENCE TO THIS PRACTICE. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED FACTORS INFLUENCING ADHERENCE TO A 16-WEEK BIKRAM YOGA INTERVENTION IN STRESSED AND SEDENTARY ADULTS. METHODS: EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PARTICIPANTS (N = 29) WERE INSTRUCTED TO ATTEND 3-5 BIKRAM YOGA CLASSES WEEKLY FOR 16 WEEKS. BASELINE DEMOGRAPHICS, BEHAVIOURS AND HEALTH MEASURES WERE INVESTIGATED AS PREDICTORS OF ADHERENCE. BARRIERS WERE ASSESSED VIA DOCUMENTATION OF ADVERSE EVENTS, AND EXIT SURVEY RESPONSES. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS (38.2 +/- 10.1 YEARS) WERE PREDOMINANTLY OVERWEIGHT-OBESE (83%), FEMALE (79%), AND ATTENDED 27 +/- 18 CLASSES. HIGHER ADHERENCE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH OLDER AGE (P = 0.094), LESS PAIN (P = 0.011), FEWER PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS (P = 0.011), POORER BLOOD LIPID PROFILE, AND HIGHER HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV; TOTAL POWER, (P = 0.097)). IN MULTI-VARIABLE ANALYSIS, THREE VARIABLES: AGE (BETA = 0.492, P = 0.006), HRV (BETA = 0.413, P = 0.021) AND PAIN (BETA = 0.329, P = 0.048) REMAINED PREDICTORS OF ADHERENCE. DIFFICULTY COMMITTING TO THE TRIAL, LACK OF ENJOYMENT AND ADVERSE EVENTS WERE BARRIERS TO ADHERENCE. CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF FUTURE BIKRAM YOGA TRIALS TO FACILITATE HIGHER LEVELS OF ADHERENCE, WHICH MAY ENHANCE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND INFORM COMMUNITY PRACTICE. FUTURE TRIALS SHOULD INVESTIGATE AND ADDRESS ADDITIONAL BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS OF BIKRAM YOGA PRACTICE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
2 1683  37 ONLINE YOGA TO REDUCE POST TRAUMATIC STRESS IN WOMEN WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED STILLBIRTH: A RANDOMIZED CONTROL FEASIBILITY TRIAL. BACKGROUND: ABOUT 1 IN EVERY 150 PREGNANCIES END IN STILLBIRTH. CONSEQUENCES INCLUDE SYMPTOMS OF POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD), DEPRESSION, AND ANXIETY. YOGA HAS BEEN USED TO TREAT PTSD IN OTHER POPULATIONS AND MAY IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR STILLBIRTH MOTHERS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE: (A) FEASIBILITY OF A 12-WEEK HOME-BASED, ONLINE YOGA INTERVENTION WITH VARYING DOSES; (B) ACCEPTABILITY OF A "STRETCH AND TONE" CONTROL GROUP; AND (C) PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF THE INTERVENTION ON REDUCING SYMPTOMS OF PTSD, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, PERINATAL GRIEF, SELF-COMPASSION, EMOTIONAL REGULATION, MINDFULNESS, SLEEP QUALITY, AND SUBJECTIVE HEALTH. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS (N = 90) WERE RECRUITED NATIONALLY AND RANDOMIZED INTO ONE OF THREE GROUPS FOR YOGA OR EXERCISE (LOW DOSE (LD), 60 MIN PER WEEK; MODERATE DOSE (MD), 150 MIN PER WEEK; AND STRETCH-AND-TONE CONTROL GROUP (STC)). BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION SURVEYS MEASURED MAIN OUTCOMES (LISTED ABOVE). FREQUENCY ANALYSES WERE USED TO DETERMINE FEASIBILITY. REPEATED MEASURES ANCOVA WERE USED TO DETERMINE PRELIMINARY EFFICACY. MULTIPLE REGRESSION ANALYSES WERE USED TO DETERMINE A DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MINUTES OF YOGA AND EACH OUTCOME VARIABLE. RESULTS: OVER HALF OF PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE INTERVENTION (N = 48/90). BENCHMARKS (>/=70% REPORTED > 75% SATISFACTION) WERE MET IN EACH GROUP FOR SATISFACTION AND ENJOYMENT. PARTICIPANTS MEETING BENCHMARKS (COMPLETING > 90% OF PRESCRIBED MINUTES 9/12 WEEKS) FOR LD AND MD GROUPS WERE 44% (N = 8/18) AND 6% (N = 1/16), RESPECTIVELY. LD AND MD GROUPS AVERAGED 44.0 AND 77.3 MIN PER WEEK OF YOGA, RESPECTIVELY. THE MD GROUP REPORTED THAT 150 PRESCRIBED MINUTES PER WEEK OF YOGA WAS TOO MUCH. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN PTSD AND DEPRESSION, AND IMPROVEMENTS IN SELF-RATED HEALTH AT POST-INTERVENTION FOR BOTH INTERVENTION GROUPS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN DEPRESSION SCORES (P = .036) AND GRIEF INTENSITY (P = .009) BETWEEN THE MD AND STC GROUPS. PTSD SHOWED NON-SIGNIFICANT DECREASES OF 43% AND 56% AT POST-INTERVENTION IN LD AND MD GROUPS, RESPECTIVELY (22% DECREASE IN CONTROL). CONCLUSIONS: THIS WAS THE FIRST STUDY TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF AN ONLINE YOGA INTERVENTION FOR WOMEN AFTER STILLBIRTH. FUTURE RESEARCH WARRANTS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. TRIAL REGISTRATION: CLINICALTRIALS.GOV. NCT02925481. REGISTERED 10-04-16.	2020	

3   34  42 A 12-WEEK IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM IMPROVED BALANCE AND MOBILITY IN OLDER COMMUNITY-DWELLING PEOPLE: A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: EXERCISE THAT CHALLENGES BALANCE CAN IMPROVE MOBILITY AND PREVENT FALLS IN OLDER ADULTS. YOGA AS A PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OPTION FOR OLDER ADULTS IS NOT WELL STUDIED. THIS TRIAL EVALUATED THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFECT OF A 12-WEEK IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM ON BALANCE AND MOBILITY IN OLDER PEOPLE. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A BLINDED, PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS. PARTICIPANTS WERE 54 COMMUNITY DWELLERS (MEAN AGE 68 YEARS, SD 7.1) NOT CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING IN YOGA OR TAI CHI. THE INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 27) PARTICIPATED IN A 12-WEEK, TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA PROGRAM FOCUSED ON STANDING POSTURES AND RECEIVED A FALL PREVENTION EDUCATION BOOKLET. THE CONTROL GROUP (N = 27) RECEIVED THE EDUCATION BOOKLET ONLY. PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS STANDING BALANCE COMPONENT OF THE SHORT PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE BATTERY WITH ADDITION OF ONE-LEGGED STANCE TIME (STANDING BALANCE). SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE THE TIMED SIT-TO-STAND TEST, TIMED 4-M WALK, ONE-LEGGED STAND WITH EYES CLOSED, AND SHORT FALLS EFFICACY SCALE-INTERNATIONAL. FEASIBILITY WAS MEASURED BY RECORDING CLASS ATTENDANCE AND ADVERSE EVENTS. RESULTS: FIFTY-TWO PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENTS. THE INTERVENTION GROUP SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED COMPARED WITH CONTROL GROUP ON STANDING BALANCE (MEAN DIFFERENCE = 1.52 SECONDS, 95% CI 0.10-2.96, P = .04), SIT-TO-STAND TEST (MEAN DIFFERENCE = -3.43 SECONDS, 95% CI -5.23 TO -1.64, P < .001), 4-M WALK (MEAN DIFFERENCE = -0.50 SECONDS, 95% CI -0.72 TO -0.28, P < .001), AND ONE-LEGGED STAND WITH EYES CLOSED (MEAN DIFFERENCE = 1.93 SECONDS, 95% CI 0.40-3.46, P = .02). AVERAGE CLASS ATTENDANCE WAS 20 OF 24 CLASSES (83%). NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS OCCURRED. CONCLUSIONS: THIS TRIAL DEMONSTRATES THE BALANCE AND MOBILITY-RELATED BENEFITS AND FEASIBILITY OF IYENGAR YOGA FOR OLDER PEOPLE. THE FALL PREVENTION EFFECT OF IYENGAR YOGA WARRANTS FURTHER INVESTIGATION.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
4 2787  47 YOGA THERAPY DECREASES DYSPNEA-RELATED DISTRESS AND IMPROVES FUNCTIONAL PERFORMANCE IN PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE: A PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: THERE HAS BEEN LIMITED STUDY OF YOGA TRAINING AS A COMPLEMENTARY EXERCISE STRATEGY TO MANAGE THE SYMPTOM OF DYSPNEA IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD). PURPOSE: THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE A YOGA PROGRAM FOR ITS SAFETY, FEASIBILITY, AND EFFICACY FOR DECREASING DYSPNEA INTENSITY (DI) AND DYSPNEA-RELATED DISTRESS (DD) IN OLDER ADULTS WITH COPD. METHODS: CLINICALLY STABLE PATIENTS WITH COPD (N = 29; AGE 69.9 +/- 9.5; FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1 SECOND (FEV(1)) 47.7 +/- 15.6% PREDICTED; FEMALE = 21) WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 12-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED FOR PEOPLE WITH COPD OR USUAL-CARE CONTROL (UC). THE TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA PROGRAM INCLUDED ASANAS (YOGA POSTURES) AND VISAMA VRITTI PRANAYAMA (TIMED BREATHING). SAFETY MEASURE OUTCOMES INCLUDED HEART RATE, OXYGEN SATURATION, DYSPNEA, AND PAIN. FEASIBILITY WAS MEASURED BY PATIENT-REPORTED ENJOYMENT, DIFFICULTY, AND ADHERENCE TO YOGA SESSIONS. AT BASELINE AND AT 12 WEEKS, DI AND DD WERE MEASURED DURING INCREMENTAL CYCLE ERGOMETRY AND A 6-MINUTE WALK (6MW) TEST. SECONDARY EFFICACY OUTCOMES INCLUDED PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE, PSYCHOLOGIC WELL-BEING, AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL). RESULTS: YOGA TRAINING WAS SAFE AND FEASIBLE FOR PATIENTS WITH COPD. WHILE YOGA TRAINING HAD ONLY SMALL EFFECTS ON DI AFTER THE 6MW TEST (EFFECT SIZE [ES], 0.20; P = 0.60), THERE WERE GREATER REDUCTIONS IN DD IN THE YOGA GROUP COMPARED TO UC (ES, 0.67; P = 0.08). YOGA TRAINING ALSO IMPROVED 6MW DISTANCE (+71.7 +/- 21.8 FEET VERSUS -27.6 +/- 36.2 FEET; ES = 0.78, P = 0.04) AND SELF-REPORTED FUNCTIONAL PERFORMANCE (ES = 0.79, P = 0.04) COMPARED TO UC. THERE WERE SMALL POSITIVE CHANGES IN MUSCLE STRENGTH AND HRQOL. CONCLUSIONS: ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH COPD PARTICIPATED SAFELY IN A 12-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM ESPECIALLY DESIGNED FOR PATIENTS WITH THIS CHRONIC ILLNESS. AFTER THE PROGRAM, THE SUBJECTS TOLERATED MORE ACTIVITY WITH LESS DD AND IMPROVED THEIR FUNCTIONAL PERFORMANCE. THESE FINDINGS NEED TO BE CONFIRMED IN A LARGER, MORE SUFFICIENTLY POWERED EFFICACY STUDY.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
5 1946  22 SATISFACTION WITH ONLINE VERSUS IN-PERSON YOGA DURING COVID-19. INTRODUCTION: DURING COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS, YOGA CLASSES TRANSITIONED TO ONLINE DELIVERY. THIS REPORT COMPARES THE PERCEIVED BENEFITS AND BARRIERS TO ONLINE AND IN-PERSON YOGA AND DETERMINE THE PREFERRED FORMAT. A SECONDARY AIM WAS TO COMPARE HOW WELL EACH FORMAT WAS PERCEIVED TO PRODUCE COMMON BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL ONLINE SURVEY OF AUSTRALIAN PARTICIPANTS. RESULTS: IN-PERSON YOGA SCORED HIGHEST FOR PROVIDING MENTAL HEALTH/MOOD BENEFITS, PHYSICAL SATISFACTION, AND FEELING ENERGIZED. ONLINE YOGA SCORED HIGHEST FOR CONVENIENCE, MENTAL HEALTH/MOOD BENEFITS, AND AFFORDABILITY (INITIAL N = 156; FOLLOW-UP N = 55). CONCLUSION: ONLINE YOGA WAS ACCEPTABLE AND PERCEIVED TO PROVIDE IMPROVED MENTAL HEALTH AND MOOD.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
6 1847  39 QUALITY OF LIFE IN YOGA EXPERIENCED AND YOGA NAIVE ASIAN INDIAN ADULTS WITH OBESITY. BACKGROUND: OBESITY ADVERSELY AFFECTS QUALITY OF LIFE WHICH THEN ACTS AS A BARRIER TO WEIGHT LOSS AND WEIGHT LOSS MAINTENANCE. HENCE, THOSE INTERVENTIONS WHICH POSITIVELY INFLUENCE THE QUALITY OF LIFE ALONG WITH WEIGHT REDUCTION ARE CONSIDERED USEFUL FOR SUSTAINED WEIGHT LOSS IN PERSONS WITH OBESITY. AN EARLIER STUDY SHOWED BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE IN OBESE ADULTS WHO HAD EXPERIENCE OF YOGA COMPARED TO YOGA NAIVE OBESE ADULTS. HOWEVER, THE MAIN LIMITATION OF THE STUDY WAS THE SMALL SAMPLE SIZE (N=20 IN EACH GROUP). OBJECTIVE: THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO DETERMINE WHETHER WITH LARGER SAMPLE SIZES THE QUALITY OF LIFE WOULD DIFFER IN YOGA EXPERIENCED COMPARED TO YOGA NAIVE ADULTS WITH OBESITY. METHODS: THERE WERE 596 ASIAN INDIAN OBESE ADULTS (AGE RANGE 20 TO 59 YEARS; GROUP MEAN AGE +/- SD; 43.9 +/- 9.9 YEARS): OF WHOM (I) 298 WERE YOGA EXPERIENCED (154 FEMALES; GROUP MEAN AGE +/- SD; 44.0 +/- 9.8 YEARS) WITH A MINIMUM OF 1 MONTH OF EXPERIENCE IN YOGA PRACTICE AND (II) 298 WERE YOGA NAIVE (154 FEMALES; GROUP MEAN AGE +/- SD; 43.8 +/- 10.0 YEARS). ALL THE PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSESSED FOR QUALITY OF LIFE USING THE MOOREHEAD-ARDELT QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE II. DATA WERE DRAWN FROM A LARGER NATIONWIDE TRIAL WHICH ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA COMPARED TO NUTRITIONAL ADVICE ON OBESITY OVER A ONE-YEAR FOLLOW-UP PERIOD (CTRI/2018/05/014077). RESULTS: THERE WERE HIGHER PARTICIPANT-REPORTED OUTCOMES FOR FOUR OUT OF SIX ASPECTS OF QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE YOGA EXPERIENCED COMPARED TO THE YOGA NAIVE (P < 0.008, BASED ON T VALUES OF THE LEAST SQUARES LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSES, BONFERRONI ADJUSTED, AND ADJUSTED FOR AGE, GENDER, AND BMI AS COVARIATES). THESE WERE ENJOYMENT IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES, ABILITY TO WORK, SELF-ESTEEM, AND SOCIAL SATISFACTION. CONCLUSION: OBESE ADULTS WITH YOGA EXPERIENCE APPEAR TO HAVE BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE IN SPECIFIC ASPECTS, COMPARED TO YOGA NAIVE PERSONS WITH A COMPARABLE DEGREE OF OBESITY.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
7 2077  24 THE EFFECT OF CHAIR YOGA IN OLDER ADULTS WITH MODERATE AND SEVERE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. USING A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL SINGLE-GROUP DESIGN, THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE FEASIBILITY OF OLDER ADULTS WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD)-TYPE DEMENTIA TO COMPLETE THE SIT 'N' FIT CHAIR YOGA PROGRAM. PHYSICAL FUNCTION OF PARTICIPANTS WHO COMPLETED THE PROGRAM WAS MEASURED. THE NINE OLDER ADULTS WITH AD (MEAN AGE = 83) PARTICIPATED IN THE 8-WEEK SIT 'N' FIT CHAIR YOGA PROGRAM. TO MEASURE PHYSICAL FUNCTION, THE SIX-MINUTE WALK TEST, THE GAIT SPEED TEST, AND THE BERG BALANCE SCALE WERE ADMINISTERED AT PRE-INTERVENTION, 4 WEEKS, 8 WEEKS, AND 1 MONTH AFTER PROGRAM COMPLETION. ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE PROGRAM. POSITIVE CHANGES WERE SEEN ACROSS ALL PHYSICAL MEASURES. FURTHER STUDY, USING A LARGER SAMPLE AND INCLUDING A CONTROL GROUP, IS NEEDED TO FULLY DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF THE SIT 'N' FIT CHAIR YOGA PROGRAM ON OLDER ADULTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE AD.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
8  680  34 EFFECT OF A YOGA PROGRAMME ON AN INDIVIDUAL WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE: A SINGLE-SUBJECT DESIGN. PURPOSE: TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF EIGHT WEEKLY YOGA SESSIONS ON BALANCE, MOBILITY AND REPORTED QUALITY OF LIFE OF AN INDIVIDUAL WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD). FURTHERMORE, TO TEST THE METHODOLOGY IN ORDER TO INFORM FUTURE RESEARCH. METHOD: A 69-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH AN 8-YEAR HISTORY OF PD (HOEHN AND YAHR RATING TWO) WAS SELECTED FOR THE STUDY, WHICH HAD A SINGLE SUBJECT ABA DESIGN. A 1-WEEK BASELINE WAS FOLLOWED BY AN 8-WEEK PERIOD OF WEEKLY 60 MIN YOGA CLASSES AND A FURTHER 5 WEEKS OF TREATMENT WITHDRAWAL. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES USED WERE BERG BALANCE SCALE (BBS), TIMED UP AND GO (TUG) AND THE PARKINSON'S DISEASE QUESTIONNAIRE-39 (PDQ-39); COLLECTED AT BASELINE, BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION AND AT FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: AN IMPROVEMENT WAS NOTED IN THE BBS AND TUG DURING THE INTERVENTION PHASE; ALTHOUGH THESE CHANGES DID NOT APPEAR TO BE CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT. NO CHANGE IN QUALITY OF LIFE AS MEASURED BY THE PDQ-39 WAS NOTED. CONCLUSIONS: THE OBJECTIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN FUNCTIONAL ACTIVITIES DURING THE INTERVENTION PERIOD WERE NOT CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT. SUBJECTIVELY, THE PARTICIPANT GAINED MUCH ENJOYMENT AND RELAXATION FROM THE YOGA CLASSES. THIS STUDY JUSTIFIES THE NEED FOR FURTHER STUDIES USING A LARGER SAMPLE SIZE. ADDITIONALLY, IT WILL INFORM THE METHODOLOGICAL DESIGN.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
9 2134  29 THE EFFECTS OF A THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM ON POSTURAL CONTROL, MOBILITY, AND GAIT SPEED IN COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF A 12-WEEK THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM ON GAIT SPEED, POSTURAL CONTROL, AND MOBILITY IN COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS. DESIGN: QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WITH A PRETEST/POST-TEST DESIGN. RESEARCHERS EVALUATED CHANGES OVER TIME (PRETEST TO POST-TEST) IN ALL OUTCOME MEASURES. PAIRED T-TESTS WERE USED TO ANALYZE NORMAL AND FAST GAIT SPEED, TIMED UP AND GO TEST, AND TIMED UP AND GO DUAL TASK. WILCOXON SIGNED-RANK TEST WAS USED TO EVALUATE SCORES FOR THE MINI-BESTEST (MBT). SETTING: YOGA CLASSES WERE PERFORMED AT A LOCAL SENIOR CENTER. BLIND EXAMINERS WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY TRAINED IN THE OUTCOME MEASURES PERFORMED ALL PRETESTS AND POST-TESTS AT THE SITE. PARTICIPANTS: THIRTEEN ADULTS (12 WOMEN AND 1 MAN, WITH A MEAN AGE+/-STANDARD DEVIATION OF 72+/-6.9 YEARS) COMPLETED THE STUDY. RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS HAD MINIMAL TO NO YOGA EXPERIENCE. INTERVENTIONS: A 12-WEEK, 60-MINUTE, BIWEEKLY KRIPALU YOGA CLASS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS. OUTCOME MEASURES: POSTURAL CONTROL (MBT), MOBILITY (TIMED UP AND GO TEST), AND GAIT SPEED (NORMAL AND FAST) WERE ASSESSED. RESULTS: ALL 13 PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED AT LEAST 19 OF THE 24 CLASSES (80% ATTENDANCE). STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE SEEN IN THE MBT (P=0.039), NORMAL GAIT SPEED (P=0.015), FAST GAIT SPEED (P=0.001), TIMED UP AND GO TEST (P=0.045), AND TIMED UP AND GO DUAL-TASK (P=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: IMPROVEMENTS IN POSTURAL CONTROL AND MOBILITY AS MEASURED BY THE MBT AND TIMED UP AND GO GAIT AS MEASURED BY FAST GAIT SPEED INDICATE THAT RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS BENEFITTED FROM THE THERAPEUTIC YOGA INTERVENTION. THE YOGA PROGRAM DESIGNED FOR THIS STUDY INCLUDED ACTIVITIES IN STANDING, SITTING, AND LYING ON THE FLOOR AND MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING MOBILITY, POSTURAL CONTROL, AND GAIT SPEED IN COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
10 1192  40 EXAMINING A THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS. BACKGROUND: IN THE EARLIER STAGES OF PROSTATE CANCER, EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS HAVE CREATED A NEED FOR RESEARCH TO FOCUS ON PRACTICES THAT MAY IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE THROUGHOUT SURVIVORSHIP. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS A SIGNIFICANT SUPPORTIVE CARE MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS, THOUGH THE OPTIMAL MODALITY IS NOT YET UNDERSTOOD. HYPOTHESES: THE AUTHORS HYPOTHESIZED THAT YOGA WOULD BE A FEASIBLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OPTION FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS AND THEIR SUPPORT PERSONS AND THAT THE INCORPORATION OF SOCIAL SUPPORT WOULD INCREASE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ADHERENCE. METHODS: THIS 14-WEEK FEASIBILITY STUDY INVOLVED A 7-WEEK CLASS-BASED YOGA PROGRAM (ADHERENCE PHASE), FOLLOWED BY 7 WEEKS OF SELF-SELECTED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (MAINTENANCE PHASE). DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEHAVIOR, QUALITY OF LIFE, FATIGUE, STRESS, MOOD, AND FITNESS VARIABLES WERE ASSESSED AT 3 TIME POINTS. PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS' PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT WAS RATED DURING YOGA AND AFTER YOGA. RESULTS: CLASS ATTENDANCE WAS 6.1 AND 5.8 FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS (N = 15) AND THEIR SUPPORT PERSONS (N = 10), RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE 7 CLASSES. LEVELS OF PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT WERE HIGHER FOR THOSE WHO BROUGHT A SUPPORT PERSON. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WITH REGARD TO STRESS, FATIGUE, AND MOOD BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA CLASS (ALL PS < .05) WERE REPORTED BY ALL PARTICIPANTS. NO CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE NOTED ON PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVOR'S QUALITY OF LIFE OR FATIGUE OVER THE COURSE OF THE 14-WEEK STUDY. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA IS A FEASIBLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OPTION FOR PROSTATE CANCER SURVIVORS. THE PROGRAM HAD A PROMISING UPTAKE RATE, HIGH PROGRAM ADHERENCE RATE, AND THERE WERE ACUTE PROGRAM BENEFITS WITH REGARD TO STRESS, FATIGUE, AND MOOD FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS. FUTURE EXAMINATION IS WARRANTED WITH REGARD TO CHRONIC BENEFITS AND GROUP COHESION INFLUENCES ON LEVELS OF PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
11  107  39 A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF THE EFFECTS OF CHAIR YOGA ON PAIN AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION AMONG COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS WITH LOWER EXTREMITY OSTEOARTHRITIS. OBJECTIVES: TO DETERMINE EFFECTS OF SIT 'N' FIT CHAIR YOGA, COMPARED TO A HEALTH EDUCATION PROGRAM (HEP), ON PAIN AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION IN OLDER ADULTS WITH LOWER EXTREMITY OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) WHO COULD NOT PARTICIPATE IN STANDING EXERCISE. DESIGN: TWO-ARM RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: ONE HUD SENIOR HOUSING FACILITY AND ONE DAY SENIOR CENTER IN SOUTH FLORIDA. PARTICIPANTS: COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS (N = 131) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO CHAIR YOGA (N = 66) OR HEP (N = 65). THIRTEEN DROPPED AFTER ASSIGNMENT BUT PRIOR TO THE INTERVENTION; SIX DROPPED DURING THE INTERVENTION; 106 OF 112 COMPLETED AT LEAST 12 OF 16 SESSIONS (95% RETENTION RATE). INTERVENTIONS: PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED EITHER CHAIR YOGA OR HEP. BOTH INTERVENTIONS CONSISTED OF TWICE-WEEKLY 45-MINUTE SESSIONS FOR 8 WEEKS. MEASUREMENTS: PRIMARY: PAIN, PAIN INTERFERENCE; SECONDARY: BALANCE, GAIT SPEED, FATIGUE, FUNCTIONAL ABILITY MEASURED AT BASELINE, AFTER 4 WEEKS OF INTERVENTION, AT THE END OF THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION, AND POST-INTERVENTION (1 AND 3 MONTHS). RESULTS: THE CHAIR YOGA GROUP SHOWED GREATER REDUCTION IN PAIN INTERFERENCE DURING THE INTERVENTION (P = .01), SUSTAINED THROUGH 3 MONTHS (P = .022). WOMAC PAIN (P = .048), GAIT SPEED (P = .024), AND FATIGUE (P = .037) WERE IMPROVED IN THE YOGA GROUP DURING THE INTERVENTION (P = .048) BUT IMPROVEMENTS WERE NOT SUSTAINED POST INTERVENTION. CHAIR YOGA HAD NO EFFECT ON BALANCE. CONCLUSION: AN 8-WEEK CHAIR YOGA PROGRAM WAS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCTION IN PAIN, PAIN INTERFERENCE, AND FATIGUE, AND IMPROVEMENT IN GAIT SPEED, BUT ONLY THE EFFECTS ON PAIN INTERFERENCE WERE SUSTAINED 3 MONTHS POST INTERVENTION. CHAIR YOGA SHOULD BE FURTHER EXPLORED AS A NONPHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTION FOR OLDER PEOPLE WITH OA IN THE LOWER EXTREMITIES.

12 1958  28 SELF-MANAGEMENT AND YOGA FOR OLDER ADULTS WITH CHRONIC STROKE: A MIXED-METHODS STUDY OF PHYSICAL FITNESS AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED CHANGES IN PHYSICAL FITNESS AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AMONG OLDER PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC STROKE (STROKE >/= 6 MONTHS PREVIOUS) AFTER PARTICIPATION IN A YOGA INFUSED SELF-MANAGEMENT INTERVENTION. METHODS: A MIXED-METHODS SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS EXAMINED QUANTITATIVE MEASURES OF ENDURANCE, STRENGTH, AND GAIT SPEED AND QUALITATIVE PERSPECTIVES OF INTERVENTION PARTICIPANTS. RESULTS: BASED ON WILCOXON ANALYSIS, PHYSICAL FITNESS OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDING ENDURANCE AND LOWER AND UPPER BODY STRENGTH SIGNIFICANTLY (P < .02) IMPROVED. BASED ON QUALITATIVE RESULTS OF 2 FOCUS GROUPS AND 14 INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS, PARTICIPANTS EXPRESSED POSITIVE CHANGES IN ENDURANCE, STRENGTH, GAIT SPEED, FLEXIBILITY, AND BALANCE. THEY ALSO REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN WALKING ABILITY AND DURATION, AND EXPRESSED A DESIRE TO CONTINUE YOGA AND INCREASE LEVELS OF EXERCISE. CONCLUSIONS: WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF IMPROVING PHYSICAL FITNESS AND EXERCISE FOR OLDER ADULTS WITH CHRONIC STROKE, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR SELF-MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS TO PROVIDE SPECIFIC SAFE AND FEASIBLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY COMPONENTS, SUCH AS YOGA.

BACKGROUND: YOGA IS A HOLISTIC THERAPY OF EXPANDING POPULARITY, WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE A RANGE OF PHYSICAL, MENTAL AND SOCIAL BENEFITS. THIS TRIAL EVALUATED THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFECTS OF AN ADAPTED YOGA PROGRAMME ON PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN PHYSICALLY-INACTIVE OLDER ADULTS. METHODS: IN THIS RANDOMISED CONTROLLED PILOT TRIAL, 52 OLDER ADULTS (90% FEMALE; MEAN AGE 74.8 YEARS, SD 7.2) WERE RANDOMISED 1:1 TO A YOGA PROGRAMME OR WAIT-LIST CONTROL. THE YOGA GROUP (N = 25) RECEIVED A PHYSICAL ACTIVITY EDUCATION BOOKLET AND WERE INVITED TO ATTEND TEN YOGA SESSIONS DURING A 12-WEEK PERIOD. THE CONTROL GROUP (N = 27) RECEIVED THE EDUCATION BOOKLET ONLY. MEASURES OF PHYSICAL FUNCTION (E.G., SHORT PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE BATTERY; SPPB), HEALTH STATUS (EQ-5D) AND MENTAL WELL-BEING (WARWICK-EDINBURGH MENTAL WELL-BEING SCALE; WEMWBS) WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND 3 MONTHS. FEASIBILITY WAS ASSESSED USING COURSE ATTENDANCE AND ADVERSE EVENT DATA, AND PARTICIPANT INTERVIEWS. RESULTS: FORTY-SEVEN PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENTS. MEDIAN CLASS ATTENDANCE WAS 8 (RANGE 3 TO 10). AT THE 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP, THE YOGA GROUP HAD A HIGHER SPPB TOTAL SCORE COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP (MEAN DIFFERENCE 0.9, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI] -0.3 TO 2.0), A FASTER TIME TO RISE FROM A CHAIR FIVE TIMES (MEAN DIFFERENCE - 1.73 S, 95% CI -4.08 TO 0.62), AND BETTER PERFORMANCE ON THE CHAIR SIT-AND-REACH LOWER-LIMB FLEXIBILITY TEST (MEAN DIFFERENCE 5 CM, 95% CI 0 TO 10). THE YOGA GROUP ALSO HAD SUPERIOR HEALTH STATUS AND MENTAL WELL-BEING (VS. CONTROL) AT 3 MONTHS, WITH MEAN DIFFERENCES IN EQ-5D AND WEMWBS SCORES OF 0.12 (95% CI, 0.03 TO 0.21) AND 6 (95% CI, 1 TO 11), RESPECTIVELY. THE INTERVIEWS INDICATED THAT PARTICIPANTS VALUED ATTENDING THE YOGA PROGRAMME, AND THAT THEY EXPERIENCED A RANGE OF BENEFITS. CONCLUSIONS: THE ADAPTED YOGA PROGRAMME APPEARED TO BE FEASIBLE AND POTENTIALLY BENEFICIAL IN TERMS OF IMPROVING MENTAL AND SOCIAL WELL-BEING AND ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL FUNCTION IN PHYSICALLY-INACTIVE OLDER ADULTS. AN APPROPRIATELY-POWERED TRIAL IS REQUIRED TO CONFIRM THE FINDINGS OF THE PRESENT STUDY AND TO DETERMINE LONGER-TERM EFFECTS.

14  666  28 EFFECT OF A 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION ON FEAR OF FALLING AND BALANCE IN OLDER ADULTS: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE WHETHER FEAR OF FALLING (FOF) AND BALANCE IMPROVED AFTER A 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION AMONG OLDER ADULTS. DESIGN: A 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION SINGLE-ARMED PILOT STUDY. SETTING: A RETIREMENT COMMUNITY IN A MEDIUM-SIZED UNIVERSITY TOWN IN THE MIDWEST. PARTICIPANTS: A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF ADULTS (N=14) OVER THE AGE OF 65 YEARS WHO ALL ENDORSED AN FOF. INTERVENTION: EACH PARTICIPANT TOOK PART IN A BIWEEKLY 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. THE YOGA SESSIONS INCLUDED BOTH PHYSICAL POSTURES AND BREATHING EXERCISES. POSTURES WERE COMPLETED IN SITTING AND STANDING POSITIONS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: WE MEASURED FOF WITH THE ILLINOIS FOF MEASURE AND BALANCE WITH THE BERG BALANCE SCALE. UPPER- AND LOWER-BODY FLEXIBILITY WERE MEASURED WITH THE BACK SCRATCH TEST AND CHAIR SIT AND REACH TEST, RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS: FOF DECREASED BY 6%, STATIC BALANCE INCREASED BY 4% (P=.045), AND LOWER-BODY FLEXIBILITY INCREASED BY 34%. CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT YOGA MAY BE A PROMISING INTERVENTION TO MANAGE FOF AND IMPROVE BALANCE, THEREBY REDUCING FALL RISK FOR OLDER ADULTS. REHABILITATION THERAPISTS MAY WISH TO EXPLORE YOGA AS A MODALITY FOR BALANCE AND FALLS PROGRAMMING; HOWEVER, FUTURE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO CONFIRM THE USE OF YOGA IN SUCH PROGRAMMING.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
15 2811  44 YOGA TO PREVENT MOBILITY LIMITATIONS IN OLDER ADULTS: FEASIBILITY OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: THE LOSS OF MOBILITY DURING AGING IMPACTS INDEPENDENCE AND LEADS TO FURTHER DISABILITY, MORBIDITY, AND REDUCED LIFE EXPECTANCY. OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND SAFETY OF CONDUCTING A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA FOR OLDER ADULTS AT RISK FOR MOBILITY LIMITATIONS. METHODS: SEDENTARY OLDER ADULTS (N = 46; AGE 60-89) WERE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED TO EITHER YOGA OR A HEALTH EDUCATION COMPARISON GROUP. YOGA SESSIONS (60-MIN) OCCURRED 2X WEEKLY, AND 90-MIN HEALTH EDUCATION SESSIONS OCCURRED WEEKLY, FOR 10 WEEKS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE RECRUITMENT RATE, INTERVENTION ATTENDANCE, AND RETENTION AT ASSESSMENTS. ADVERSE EVENT RATES AND PARTICIPANT SATISFACTION WERE ALSO MEASURED. PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES OF GAIT, BALANCE, AND STRENGTH AND SELF-REPORT OUTCOME MEASURES WERE ADMINISTERED AT BASELINE AND 10-WEEKS. RESULTS: RECRUITMENT LASTED 6 MONTHS. RETENTION OF PARTICIPANTS AT THE 10-WEEK FOLLOW-UP WAS HIGH (89% - PERFORMANCE MEASURES; 98% - SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES). ATTENDANCE WAS GOOD WITH 82% OF YOGA AND 74% OF HEALTH EDUCATION PARTICIPANTS ATTENDING AT LEAST 50% OF THE SESSIONS. NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. PATIENT SATISFACTION WITH THE INTERVENTIONS WAS HIGH. THE MEAN EFFECT SIZE FOR THE PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES WAS 0.35 WITH SOME OVER 0.50. THE MEAN EFFECT SIZE FOR SELF-REPORT OUTCOME MEASURES WAS 0.36. CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS INDICATE THAT IT IS FEASIBLE TO CONDUCT A LARGER RCT OF YOGA FOR SEDENTARY OLDER ADULTS AT RISK FOR MOBILITY PROBLEMS. THE YOGA AND COMPARISON INTERVENTIONS WERE SAFE, WELL ACCEPTED, AND WELL ATTENDED. EFFECT SIZES SUGGEST YOGA MAY HAVE IMPORTANT BENEFITS FOR THIS POPULATION AND SHOULD BE STUDIED FURTHER.

16 2650  29 YOGA IMPROVES BALANCE AND LOW-BACK PAIN, BUT NOT ANXIETY, IN PEOPLE WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE. INDIVIDUALS WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD) EXPERIENCE POSTURAL INSTABILITY, LOW-BACK PAIN (LBP), AND ANXIETY. THESE SYMPTOMS INCREASE THE RISK OF FALLS AND DECREASE QUALITY OF LIFE. RESEARCH SHOWS YOGA IMPROVES BALANCE AND DECREASES LBP AND ANXIETY IN HEALTHY ADULTS, BUT ITS EFFECTS IN PD ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. ALL PARTICIPANTS WERE PART OF A LARGER INTERVENTION STUDY. PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED PRETEST AND POSTTEST EVALUATIONS, INCLUDING THE BALANCE EVALUATION SYSTEMS TEST (BESTEST), BECK ANXIETY INVENTORY (BAI), AND REVISED OSWESTRY DISABILITY INDEX (ROSW). TOTAL SCORES FOR EACH MEASURE, AS WELL AS INDIVIDUAL BALANCE SYSTEM SECTION SCORES FROM THE BESTEST (BIOMECHANICAL CONSTRAINTS, STABILITY LIMITS/VERTICALITY, TRANSITIONS/ANTICIPATORY, REACTIVE, SENSORY ORIENTATION, AND STABILITY IN GAIT) WERE COMPARED WITHIN GROUPS PRE- TO POSTTEST. PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP (N = 13) COMPLETED A TWICE-WEEKLY 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVE N T I O N , WHEREAS CONTROLS (N = 13) CONTINUED THEIR USUAL ROUTINES FOR 12 WEEKS. BOTH THE YOGA (Z = -3.20, P = 0.001) AND CONTROL (Z = -2.10, P = 0.040) GROUPS IMPROVED ON THE BESTEST TOTAL SCORE. THE CONTROL GROUP SHOWED NO CHANGES IN INDIVIDUAL BALANCE SYSTEMS, WHEREAS THE YOGA GROUP IMPROVED IN STABILITY LIMITS/VERTICALITY (Z = -2.3, P = 0.020), TRANSITIONS/ ANTICIPATORY (Z = -2.50, P = 0.010), REACTIVE (Z = -2.70, P = 0.008), AND SENSORY ORIENTATION (Z = -2.30, P = 0.020). ROSW DECREASED IN THE YOGA GROUP ONLY (Z = -2.10, P = 0.030). BAI DID NOT CHANGE IN EITHER GROUP. YOGA IS A NONPHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION THAT CAN IMPROVE BALANCE AND LBP IN PEOPLE WITH PD. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT YOGA IS FEASIBLE FOR PEOPLE WITH PD, AND PARTICIPANTS REPORTED HIGH LEVELS OF ENJOYMENT AND INTENT TO PRACTICE YOGA AFTER THE STUDY.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
17 1235  43 FEASIBILITY AND SAFETY OF INTRADIALYSIS YOGA AND EDUCATION IN MAINTENANCE HEMODIALYSIS PATIENTS. OBJECTIVE: PATIENTS WITH END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE ON MAINTENANCE HEMODIALYSIS ARE MUCH MORE SEDENTARY THAN HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY AND SAFETY OF A 12-WEEK INTRADIALYSIS YOGA INTERVENTION VERSUS A KIDNEY EDUCATION INTERVENTION ON THE PROMOTION OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. DESIGN AND METHODS: WE RANDOMIZED PARTICIPANTS BY DIALYSIS SHIFT TO EITHER 12-WEEK INTRADIALYSIS YOGA OR AN EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION. INTRADIALYSIS YOGA WAS PROVIDED BY YOGA TEACHERS TO PARTICIPANTS WHILE RECEIVING HEMODIALYSIS. PARTICIPANTS RECEIVING THE 12-WEEK EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION RECEIVED A MODIFICATION OF A PREVIOUSLY DEVELOPED COMPREHENSIVE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM FOR PATIENTS WITH KIDNEY DISEASE (KIDNEY SCHOOL). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME FOR THIS STUDY WAS FEASIBILITY BASED ON RECRUITMENT AND ADHERENCE TO THE INTERVENTIONS AND SAFETY OF INTRADIALYSIS YOGA. SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF ADMINISTERING QUESTIONNAIRES AT BASELINE AND 12 WEEKS INCLUDING THE KIDNEY DISEASE-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE-36. RESULTS: AMONG 56 ELIGIBLE PATIENTS WHO APPROACHED FOR THE STUDY, 31 (55%) WERE INTERESTED AND CONSENTED TO PARTICIPATION, WITH 18 ASSIGNED TO INTRADIALYSIS YOGA AND 13 TO THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM. A TOTAL OF 5 PARTICIPANTS WITHDREW FROM THE PILOT STUDY, ALL FROM THE INTRADIALYSIS YOGA GROUP. TWO OF THESE PARTICIPANTS REPORTED NO FURTHER INTEREST IN PARTICIPATION. THREE WITHDRAWN PARTICIPANTS SWITCHED DIALYSIS TIMES AND THEREFORE COULD NO LONGER RECEIVE INTRADIALYSIS YOGA. AS A RESULT, 13 OF 18 (72%) AND 13 OF 13 (100%) PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED 12-WEEK INTRADIALYSIS YOGA AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS, RESPECTIVELY. THERE WERE NO ADVERSE EVENTS RELATED TO INTRADIALYSIS YOGA. INTERVENTION PARTICIPANTS PRACTICED YOGA FOR A MEDIAN OF 21 SESSIONS (70% PARTICIPATION FREQUENCY), WITH 60% OF PARTICIPANTS PRACTICING AT LEAST 2 TIMES A WEEK. PARTICIPANTS IN THE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM COMPLETED A MEDIAN OF 30 SESSIONS (83% PARTICIPATION FREQUENCY). OF PARTICIPANTS WHO COMPLETED THE STUDY (N = 26), BASELINE AND 12-WEEK QUESTIONNAIRES WERE OBTAINED FROM 85%. CONCLUSIONS: OUR PILOT STUDY OF 12-WEEK INTRADIALYSIS YOGA AND 12-WEEK EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION REACHED RECRUITMENT GOALS BUT WITH LESS THAN TARGETED COMPLETION AND ADHERENCE TO INTERVENTION RATES. THIS STUDY PROVIDED VALUABLE FEASIBILITY DATA TO INCREASE FOLLOW-UP AND ADHERENCE FOR FUTURE CLINICAL TRIALS TO COMPARE EFFICACY.	2015	
                 
18  592  34 DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF A YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAMME FOR OLDER ADULTS. AIM: THIS STUDY REPORTS THE DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF A NEW YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAMME FOR OLDER ADULTS, CALLED THE SILVER YOGA PROGRAMME. BACKGROUND: YOGA PRACTICE IS ASSOCIATED WITH NUMEROUS HEALTH IMPROVEMENTS, INCLUDING REDUCED CARDIOVASCULAR RISK, BODY MASS INDEX AND BLOOD PRESSURE. YOGA IS ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED RESPIRATION, PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH AND PAIN MANAGEMENT. STUDIES HAVE SUGGESTED THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA IN THE OLDER POPULATION. METHOD: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN 2005 AND IT HAD TWO PHASES. PHASE I CONSISTED OF SENDING A SURVEY TO 10 EXPERTS TO HELP DEVELOP THE SILVER YOGA PROGRAMME. A HARD COPY AND A VIDEO CONTAINING DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS AND DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE PROGRAMME WERE THEN SENT TO THE EXPERTS FOR REVIEW AND CRITIQUE REGARDING THE CLARITY AND FEASIBILITY OF THE YOGA POSTURES. PHASE II WAS AN ENQUIRY INTO OLDER ADULTS' VIEWS ON THE PROGRAMME USING A QUANTITATIVE EVALUATION AND SEMI-STRUCTURED QUALITATIVE INQUIRY. FOURTEEN WOMEN PARTICIPANTS FROM A SENIOR ACTIVITY CENTRE WERE INTERVIEWED INDIVIDUALLY AFTER 1 MONTH OF SILVER YOGA GROUP PRACTICE, THREE TIMES PER WEEK, 70 MINUTES PER SESSION. THEY WERE ASKED TO EVALUATE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF POSTURES BASED ON THE CRITERIA OF DIFFICULTY, ACCEPTABILITY, FEASIBILITY AND HELPFULNESS. FIVE OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS ASKED PARTICIPANTS TO REFLECT ON THEIR YOGA EXPERIENCES. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS' MEAN RATINGS OF THE ACCEPTABILITY, FEASIBILITY AND HELPFULNESS OF THE FOUR ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAMME (WARM-UP, HATHA YOGA, RELAXATION AND GUIDED-IMAGERY MEDITATION) RANGED FROM 8.8 +/- 1.9 TO 9.3 +/- 1.5; MEAN RATINGS OF THE DIFFICULTY OF THE PROGRAMME REVEALED THAT RELAXATION AND GUIDED-IMAGERY MEDITATION WERE FAIRLY EASY TO FOLLOW (0.1 +/- 0.3 AND 0.1 +/- 0.3 RESPECTIVELY), BUT THE POSTURES IN THE HATHA YOGA WERE RELATIVELY CHALLENGING (2.1 +/- 2.6). CONCLUSION: THE SILVER YOGA PROGRAMME SHOULD UNDERGO FURTHER PILOT-TESTING WITH LARGER SAMPLES OF OLDER ADULTS BEFORE IT IS TAKEN UP INTERNATIONALLY AS A HEALTH-PROMOTION ACTIVITY FOR OLDER ADULTS.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
19  478  33 CLINICAL CASE REPORT: YOGA FOR FATIGUE IN FIVE YOUNG ADULT SURVIVORS OF CHILDHOOD CANCER. PURPOSE: CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (CRF) IS A DISTRESSING CONSEQUENCE OF CANCER AND ITS TREATMENT. CRF IMPACTS MANY YOUNG ADULT (YA) SURVIVORS OF CHILDHOOD CANCER, COMPROMISING WORK, SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND DAILY ACTIVITIES. NO SATISFACTORY TREATMENT EXISTS. THIS PILOT STUDY AIMED TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY, SAFETY, AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF AN 8-WEEK TWICE/WEEK IYENGAR YOGA (IY) INTERVENTION FOR TREATING PERSISTENT FATIGUE IN YA SURVIVORS OF CHILDHOOD CANCER. METHODS: USING A SINGLE-ARM MIXED-METHODS DESIGN, ADULT CHILDHOOD CANCER SURVIVORS AGED BETWEEN 18 AND 39 YEARS WERE RECRUITED FROM A SURVIVORSHIP CLINIC AT A SINGLE INSTITUTION. QUANTITATIVE: THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS FATIGUE AS MEASURED BY THE FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CHRONIC ILLNESS THERAPY-FATIGUE. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED VITALITY, SOCIAL FUNCTIONING, MULTIDIMENSIONAL FATIGUE, MOOD, AND SLEEP. WEEKLY SELF-REPORT MONITORING DATA WERE COLLECTED. QUALITATIVE: PARTICIPANTS ALSO COMPLETED A POST-INTERVENTION INTERVIEW, MAJOR THEMES EVALUATED. RESULTS: FIVE PARTICIPANTS ENROLLED INTO THE STUDY AND FOUR COMPLETED THE INTERVENTION. ATTENDANCE WAS 92% AND THERE WERE NO ADVERSE EVENTS. BASELINE MOBILITY WAS HIGHLY VARIED, WITH ONE YA HAVING HAD A HEMIPELVECTOMY. QUANTITATIVE DATA REVEALED SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED FATIGUE, SOCIAL FUNCTIONING, SOMATIZATION, AND GENERAL AND EMOTIONAL MANIFESTATIONS OF FATIGUE FOLLOWING YOGA. QUALITATIVE DATA CROSS VALIDATED, CLARIFIED, AND EXPANDED UPON THE QUANTITATIVE FINDINGS. CONCLUSIONS: THE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT A BRIEF IY INTERVENTION IS SAFE FOR YA SURVIVORS OF CHILDHOOD CANCER, EVEN FOR THOSE WITH PHYSICAL DISABILITIES. PRELIMINARY EFFICACY WAS DEMONSTRATED FOR THE PRIMARY OUTCOME OF FATIGUE. QUALITATIVE DATA ELUCIDATED ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS, SUCH AS WORK-RELATED SOCIAL FUNCTIONING, AND A SENSE OF CALM AND RELAXATION.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
20   71  34 A FEASIBILITY STUDY OF RESTORATIVE YOGA VERSUS VIGOROUS YOGA INTERVENTION FOR SEDENTARY BREAST AND OVARIAN CANCER SURVIVORS. YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE CANCER SURVIVORS' QUALITY OF LIFE, YET REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE IS A CHALLENGE FOR THOSE WHO ARE SEDENTARY. WE CONDUCTED A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY TO ASSESS FEASIBILITY AND ADHERENCE OF TWO TYPES OF YOGA INTERVENTION AMONG SEDENTARY CANCER SURVIVORS. SEDENTARY BREAST AND OVARIAN CANCER SURVIVORS WERE RANDOMIZED TO PRACTICE EITHER RESTORATIVE YOGA (MINIMAL PHYSICAL EXERTION, GROUP R) OR VIGOROUS YOGA (CONSIDERABLE PHYSICAL EXERTION, GROUP V) IN THREE 60-MINUTE SUPERVISED SESSIONS A WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS, FOLLOWED BY 12 WEEKS OF HOME PRACTICE. ACCRUAL, ADHERENCE, AND ATTENDANCE RATES WERE ASSESSED. OF THE 226 ELIGIBLE PATIENTS, 175 (77%) DECLINED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY, CITING TIME COMMITMENT AND TRAVEL AS THE MOST COMMON BARRIERS. FORTY-TWO SUBJECTS CONSENTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY. OF THE 35 PARTICIPANTS WHO BEGAN THE INTERVENTION (20 IN GROUP R AND 15 IN GROUP V), ADHERENCE RATE (PERCENTAGE REMAINING IN THE STUDY AT WEEK 12) WAS 100% AND 87%, RESPECTIVELY. RATE OF ADEQUATE ATTENDANCE (MORE THAN 66% OF THE SCHEDULED SUPERVISED SESSIONS) WAS 85% AND 73%, RESPECTIVELY. RATE OF COMPLETION OF THE HOME PRACTICE PERIOD WAS 85% AND 77%, RESPECTIVELY. IN THIS STUDY, SEDENTARY CANCER SURVIVORS WERE ABLE TO ADHERE TO A LONG-TERM, REGULAR YOGA REGIMEN. THE RATE OF ADEQUATE ATTENDANCE WAS HIGHER FOR RESTORATIVE YOGA. FUTURE STUDIES FOR SEDENTARY PATIENTS SHOULD FOCUS ON REDUCING TIME COMMITMENT AND TRAVEL REQUIREMENTS TO IMPROVE RECRUITMENT, AND ON USING RESTORATIVE YOGA AS A MORE FEASIBLE INTERVENTION FOR THIS POPULATION.	2018

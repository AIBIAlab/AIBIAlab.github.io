1 2674 137 YOGA IN PRINT MEDIA: MISSING THE HEART OF THE PRACTICE. BACKGROUND: POPULAR MEDIA TYPICALLY PORTRAY YOGA AS AN EXERCISE OR POSTURE PRACTICE DESPITE THE REALITY THAT YOGA COMPRISED EIGHT PRACTICES (CALLED LIMBS) INCLUDING ETHICAL BEHAVIOR, CONSCIOUS LIFESTYLE CHOICES, POSTURES, BREATHING, INTROSPECTION, CONCENTRATION, MEDITATION, AND WHOLENESS. AIM: THIS STUDY ASSESSED THE COMPREHENSIVENESS OF YOGA PRACTICE AS REPRESENTED IN ARTICLES IN THE POPULAR YOGA MAGAZINE, YOGA JOURNAL. IT EXPLORED THE DEGREE TO WHICH ARTICLES REFERENCED EACH OF THE EIGHT LIMBS OF YOGA AND OTHER CONTENTS (E.G., FITNESS, SPIRITUALITY). MATERIALS AND METHODS: SIX CODERS WERE TRAINED TO RELIABLY AND INDEPENDENTLY REVIEW 702 ARTICLES IN 33 YOGA JOURNAL ISSUES PUBLISHED BETWEEN 2007 AND 2014, CODING FOR THE LIMBS OF YOGA AND OTHER CONTENTS. RESULTS: BREATHING AND POSTURES WERE MOST FREQUENTLY REFERENCED, WHICH WERE COVERED IN 48.7% AND 40.1% OF ARTICLES. INTERNAL PRACTICES WERE COVERED IN 36.5% OF ARTICLES WITH INTROSPECTION BEING THE MOST AND CONCENTRATION THE LEAST COMMONLY REFERRED TO INTERNAL PRACTICES. ETHICAL AND LIFESTYLE PRACTICES WERE LEAST FREQUENTLY COVERED (5.2% AND 6.8%). SINCE 2007, COVERAGE OF POSTURES STEADILY INCREASED, WHEREAS CONTENTS RELATED TO THE OTHER LIMBS STEADILY DECREASED. THE MOST FREQUENT OTHER CONTENTS RELATED TO FITNESS (31.7%), SPIRITUALITY (20.8), AND RELATIONSHIPS (18.7%) COVERAGE OF THESE DID NOT CHANGE ACROSS TIME. CONCLUSIONS: REPRESENTATION OF YOGA IN ARTICLES CONTAINED IN THE MOST POPULAR YOGA MAGAZINE IS HEAVILY BIASED IN FAVOR OF PHYSICAL PRACTICES. RECOMMENDATIONS ARE OFFERED ABOUT HOW TO SHIFT MEDIA REPRESENTATION OF YOGA TO MAKE THE HEART OF THE PRACTICE MORE ACCESSIBLE TO INDIVIDUALS WHO COULD EXPERIENCE HEALTH BENEFITS BUT CURRENTLY FEEL EXCLUDED FROM THE PRACTICE.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
2  157  30 A QUALITATIVE STUDY ON THE PRACTICE OF YOGA FOR WOMEN WITH PAIN-ASSOCIATED ENDOMETRIOSIS. OBJECTIVES: TO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING WOMEN WITH PAIN-ASSOCIATED ENDOMETRIOSIS ATTRIBUTE TO YOGA PRACTICE REGARDING THEIR PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL STATE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PRACTICE; PAIN MANAGEMENT BY INTEGRATING BODY AND MIND; SECONDARY BENEFITS OF THE PRACTICE OF YOGA, SUCH AS SELF-KNOWLEDGE, SELF-CARE, AND AUTONOMY; AND THE ROLE OF THE YOGA GROUP AS PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT. DESIGN: QUALITATIVE STUDY CONDUCTED SIMULTANEOUSLY WITH A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. SETTING: PUBLIC UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL IN SOUTHEASTERN BRAZIL BETWEEN AUGUST 2013 AND DECEMBER 2014. PARTICIPANTS: FIFTEEN WOMEN WITH PAIN-ASSOCIATED ENDOMETRIOSIS WHO PRACTICED YOGA FOR 8 WEEKS. INTERVENTION: AFTER COMPLETING THE TWICE-A-WEEK PROGRAM, ALL WOMEN PARTICIPATED IN A SINGLE, SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW. INTERVIEWS WERE RECORDED AND TRANSCRIBED VERBATIM, AND THEMATIC ANALYSES WERE PERFORMED. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE MAIN THEMES OF ANALYSIS WERE WOMEN'S EXPECTATIONS REGARDING THE PRACTICE OF YOGA, PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL STATE OF WOMEN AT THE BEGINNING OF YOGA PRACTICE, CONTROL AND PAIN MANAGEMENT THROUGH THE INTEGRATION OF BODY AND MIND, SECONDARY BENEFITS, ACQUISITION OF SELF-KNOWLEDGE AND AUTONOMY, AND THE ROLE OF YOGA GROUP AS PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT. RESULTS: ALL PARTICIPANTS REPORTED THAT YOGA WAS BENEFICIAL TO CONTROL PELVIC PAIN. THEY RELATED THAT THEY WERE AWARE OF THE INTEGRATION OF BODY AND PSYCHE DURING YOGA PRACTICE AND THAT THIS HELPED IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PAIN. WOMEN SAID THEY HAD IDENTIFIED A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PAIN MANAGEMENT AND BREATHING TECHNIQUES (PRANAYAMA) LEARNED IN YOGA AND THAT BREATHING INCREASED THEIR ABILITY TO BE INTROSPECTIVE, WHICH RELIEVED PAIN. THE PARTICIPANTS HAVE DEVELOPED GREATER SELF-KNOWLEDGE, AUTONOMY, AND SELF-CARE AND HAVE REDUCED THE USE OF PAIN AND PSYCHIATRIC MEDICATIONS. THEY CREATED TIES AMONG THEMSELVES, SUGGESTING THAT THE YOGA GROUP ALLOWED PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT. CONCLUSIONS: BODILY AND PSYCHOSOCIAL MECHANISMS TO CONTROL PAIN WERE IDENTIFIED IN WOMEN WITH ENDOMETRIOSIS. TO REACH SUCH CONTROL, IT IS CRUCIAL THAT MIND AND BODY INTEGRATIVE TECHNIQUES ARE LEARNED.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                            
3 2709  40 YOGA IS FOR EVERY (ABLE) BODY: A CONTENT ANALYSIS OF DISABILITY THEMES WITHIN MAINSTREAM YOGA MEDIA. YOGA IS INCREASINGLY BEING RECOMMENDED AS A HEALTH SELF-MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR PEOPLE WITH A RANGE OF DISABILITIES. MAINSTREAM YOGA MEDIA HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED FOR LIMITED REPRESENTATION OF RACIAL/ETHNIC, GENDER, AGE, AND BODY SIZE DIVERSITY WITHIN THEIR PUBLICATIONS; HOWEVER, IT IS NOT KNOWN HOW THESE MEDIA OUTLETS INCLUDE VISUAL REPRESENTATIONS OF OR TEXTUAL INFORMATION RELEVANT FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES (PWDS). THE PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO UNDERSTAND IF AND HOW MAINSTREAM YOGA MEDIA VISUALLY REPRESENT AND INCLUDE INFORMATION FOR PWDS. WE CONDUCTED A CONTENT ANALYSIS OF THE "YOGAPEDIA" SECTION OF EACH YOGA JOURNAL MAGAZINE PUBLISHED IN 2015 AND 2016 (N = 17). TWO INDEPENDENT CODERS RATED ALL OF THE IMAGES AND TEXT IN THESE SECTIONS. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING A THEMATIC APPROACH INFORMED BY A PROMINENT THEORETICAL MODEL OF DISABLEMENT. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT IMAGES CONTAINED NO REPRESENTATION OF DISABILITY. IN CONTRAST, MAGAZINE TEXT INCLUDED AN ABUNDANCE OF REFERENCES TO DISABILITY; HOWEVER, THESE MENTIONS PREDOMINATELY ALIGNED WITH CONSTRUCTS FOUND EARLY IN THE DISABLEMENT PROCESS AND STRONGLY FOCUSED ON PHYSICAL AND MOBILITY LIMITATIONS. THESE FINDINGS EXPAND UPON PREVIOUS RESEARCH EXAMINING THE UNDERREPRESENTATION OF MARGINALIZED GROUPS WITHIN YOGA MEDIA AND ILLUMINATE A PAUCITY OF RELEVANT INFORMATION FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES WHO ARE INTERESTED IN AND MAY BENEFIT FROM YOGA PRACTICE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
4  153  33 A QUALITATIVE STUDY EXPLORING HOW THE AIMS, LANGUAGE AND ACTIONS OF YOGA FOR PREGNANCY TEACHERS MAY IMPACT UPON WOMEN'S SELF-EFFICACY FOR LABOUR AND BIRTH. BACKGROUND: AS WOMEN'S ANXIETY AND THE RATE OF MEDICAL INTERVENTION IN LABOUR AND BIRTH CONTINUE TO INCREASE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY HOW ANTENATAL EDUCATION CAN INCREASE WOMEN'S CONFIDENCE AND THEIR ABILITY TO MANAGE THE INTENSE SENSATIONS OF LABOUR. AIM: TO REPORT A GROUNDED THEORY STUDY OF HOW THE AIMS, LANGUAGE AND ACTIONS OF YOGA FOR PREGNANCY TEACHERS MAY IMPACT UPON WOMEN'S SELF-EFFICACY FOR LABOUR AND BIRTH. METHODS: YOGA FOR PREGNANCY CLASSES IN THREE LOCATIONS WERE FILMED. SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE UNDERTAKEN WITH THE TEACHERS TO EXPLORE WHAT THEY WERE TRYING TO ACHIEVE IN THEIR CLASSES, AND HOW. INTERVIEWS AND CLASSES WERE TRANSCRIBED AND ANALYSED USING GROUNDED THEORY. FINDINGS: THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE CONSISTENCY IN THE TEACHERS' AIMS, THE LANGUAGE THEY USED IN CLASSES AND IN THEIR THINKING ABOUT CLASS STRUCTURE. FOUR MAIN THEMES EMERGED: CREATING A SISTERHOOD, MODELLING LABOUR, BUILDING CONFIDENCE AND ENHANCING LEARNING. TEACHERS SEE YOGA FOR PREGNANCY AS A MULTI-FACETED, NON-PRESCRIPTIVE INTERVENTION THAT ENHANCES WOMEN'S PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL AND SOCIAL READINESS FOR LABOUR AND BIRTH, AND SUPPORTS WOMEN TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS ACROSS THE TRANSITION TO PARENTHOOD. CONCLUSION: WOMEN'S SELF-EFFICACY FOR LABOUR IS COMPLEX AND MULTI-FACTORIAL. THIS STUDY OFFERS INSIGHTS INTO THE FACTORS WHICH MAY BE INVOLVED IN INCREASING IT. THESE INCLUDE NOT ONLY TRADITIONAL ELEMENTS OF YOGA SUCH AS POSTURES, BREATHING AND MEDITATION, BUT ALSO THE CREATION OF SAFE, WOMEN-ONLY GROUPS WHERE ANXIETIES, EXPERIENCES AND STORIES CAN BE SHARED, AND PAIN-COPING TECHNIQUES FOR LABOUR LEARNED AND PRACTISED.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
5 1189  28 EVIDENCE ON YOGA FOR HEALTH: A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS. OBJECTIVE: TO SUPPORT THE RESEARCH AGENDA IN YOGA FOR HEALTH BY COMPREHENSIVELY IDENTIFYING SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF YOGA FOR HEALTH OUTCOMES AND CONDUCTING A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS TO DESCRIBE THEIR PUBLICATION CHARACTERISTICS AND TOPIC COVERAGE. METHODS: WE SEARCHED 7 DATABASES (MEDLINE/PUBMED, EMBASE, PSYCINFO, CINAHL, AMED, THE COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS, AND PROSPERO) FROM THEIR INCEPTION TO NOVEMBER 2019 AND 1 DATABASE (INDMED) FROM INCEPTION TO JANUARY 2017. TWO AUTHORS INDEPENDENTLY SCREENED EACH RECORD FOR INCLUSION AND ONE AUTHOR EXTRACTED PUBLICATION CHARACTERISTICS AND TOPICS OF INCLUDED REVIEWS. RESULTS: WE RETRIEVED 2710 RECORDS AND INCLUDED 322 SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS. 157 REVIEWS WERE EXCLUSIVELY ON YOGA, AND 165 WERE ON YOGA AS ONE OF A LARGER CLASS OF INTERVENTIONS (E.G., EXERCISE). MOST REVIEWS WERE PUBLISHED IN 2012 OR LATER (260/322; 81 %). FIRST/CORRESPONDING AUTHORS WERE FROM 32 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES; THREE-QUARTERS WERE FROM THE USA, GERMANY, CHINA, AUSTRALIA, THE UK OR CANADA (240/322; 75 %). REVIEWS WERE MOST FREQUENTLY PUBLISHED IN SPECIALITY JOURNALS (161/322; 50 %) COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE JOURNALS (66/322; 20 %) OR SYSTEMATIC REVIEW JOURNALS (59/322; 18 %). ALMOST ALL WERE PRESENT IN MEDLINE (296/322; 92 %). REVIEWS WERE MOST OFTEN FUNDED BY GOVERNMENT OR NON-PROFITS (134/322; 42 %), UNFUNDED (74/322; 23 %), OR NOT EXPLICIT ABOUT FUNDING (111/322; 34 %). COMMON HEALTH TOPICS WERE PSYCHIATRIC/COGNITIVE (N = 56), CANCER (N = 39) AND MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS (N = 36). MULTIPLE REVIEWS COVERED SIMILAR TOPICS, PARTICULARLY DEPRESSION/ANXIETY (N = 18), BREAST CANCER (N = 21), AND LOW BACK PAIN (N = 16). CONCLUSIONS: FURTHER RESEARCH SHOULD EXPLORE THE OVERALL QUALITY OF REPORTING AND CONDUCT OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF YOGA, THE DIRECTION AND CERTAINTY OF SPECIFIC CONCLUSIONS, AND DUPLICATION OR GAPS IN REVIEW COVERAGE OF TOPICS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
6 2380  30 WOMEN'S EXPERIENCES OF PARTICIPATION IN A PREGNANCY AND POSTNATAL GROUP INCORPORATING YOGA AND FACILITATED GROUP DISCUSSION: A QUALITATIVE EVALUATION. BACKGROUND: THIS PAPER REPORTS ON A SMALL QUALITATIVE RESEARCH STUDY WHICH EXPLORED WOMEN'S EXPERIENCES OF PARTICIPATION IN A PREGNANCY AND POSTNATAL GROUP THAT INCORPORATED YOGA AND FACILITATED DISCUSSION. THE GROUP IS OFFERED THROUGH A COMMUNITY BASED FEMINIST NON-GOVERNMENT WOMEN'S HEALTH CENTRE IN NORTHERN NSW AUSTRALIA. QUESTION: THE PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH WAS TO EXPLORE WOMEN'S EXPERIENCES OF ATTENDING THIS PREGNANCY AND POSTNATAL GROUP. METHODS: AN EXPLORATORY QUALITATIVE APPROACH WAS USED TO EXPLORE WOMEN'S EXPERIENCES OF ATTENDING THE GROUP. FIFTEEN WOMEN PARTICIPATED IN INDIVIDUAL, IN-DEPTH FACE-TO-FACE INTERVIEWS. INTERVIEWS WERE RECORDED AND TRANSCRIBED VERBATIM. THEMATIC ANALYSIS WAS UNDERTAKEN TO ANALYSE THE QUALITATIVE DATA. FINDINGS: SIX THEMES WERE DEVELOPED, ONE WITH 3 SUBTHEMES. ONE THEME WAS LABELLED AS: 'THE PREGNANCY AND MOTHERHOOD JOURNEY' AND INCLUDED 3 SUB-THEMES WHICH WERE LABELLED: 'PREPARATION FOR BIRTH', 'CONNECTING WITH THE BABY' AND 'SHARING BIRTH STORIES.' THE OTHER FIVE THEMES WERE: 'FEMININE NURTURING SAFE SPACE', 'WATCHING AND LEARNING THE MOTHERING', 'BUILDING MENTAL HEALTH, WELL-BEING AND CONNECTIONS', THE "GROUP LIKE A ROCK AND A SEED' AND 'DIFFERENT FROM MAINSTREAM'. CONCLUSION: THIS RESEARCH ADDS TO THE OVERALL BODY OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE VALUE OF YOGA IN PRE AND POSTNATAL CARE. IT DEMONSTRATES THE VALUE OF SHARING BIRTH STORIES AND THE STRONG CAPACITY WOMEN HAVE TO SUPPORT ONE ANOTHER, BRINGING BENEFITS OF EMOTIONAL AND SOCIAL WELL-BEING, INFORMATION, RESOURCES AND SUPPORT DERIVED FROM GROUP BASED MODELS OF CARE.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
7   40  39 A BRIEF QUALITATIVE SURVEY ON THE UTILIZATION OF YOGA RESEARCH RESOURCES BY YOGA TEACHERS. INTRODUCTION: YOGA HAS BECOME POPULAR WORLDWIDE WITH INCREASING RESEARCH DONE ON ITS THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL. HOWEVER, IT REMAINS TO BE DETERMINED WHETHER SUCH FINDINGS ACTUALLY PERCOLATE DOWN INTO TEACHING AND PRACTICE OF YOGA TEACHERS/THERAPISTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE AIM OF THIS SURVEY WAS TO DOCUMENT AWARENESS OF YOGA RESEARCH FINDINGS IN THE YOGA COMMUNITY AND FIND OUT HOW THESE WERE UTILIZED. IT WAS UNDERTAKEN WITH A SELECT GROUP OF 34 INTERNATIONAL YOGA TEACHERS AND THERAPISTS UTILIZING EMAIL AND SOCIAL MEDIA BETWEEN AUGUST AND DECEMBER 2015. MAJORITY OF RESPONDERS HAD WELL-ESTABLISHED REPUTATION IN YOGA AND WERE FROM DIVERSE LINEAGES WITH 30 OF THEM HAVING MORE THAN 5 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN THE FIELD. A SET OF EIGHT QUESTIONS WERE SENT TO THEM RELATED TO ESSENTIALITY OF YOGA RESEARCH, HOW THEY UPDATED THEMSELVES ON RESEARCH FINDINGS AND WHETHER SUCH STUDIES INFLUENCED THEIR TEACHING AND PRACTICE. RESPONSES WERE COMPILED AND APPROPRIATE STATISTICS DETERMINED FOR QUANTITATIVE ASPECTS WHILE FEEDBACK, COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS WERE NOTED IN DETAIL. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: ABOUT 89% AGREED THAT IT WAS ESSENTIAL TO BE UP-TO-DATE ON YOGA RESEARCH BUT ONLY 70% UPDATED THEMSELVES REGULARLY WITH AVERAGE PAPERS READ FULLY PER YEAR BEING <10. MOST ACCESSED INFORMATION THROUGH GENERAL NEWS REPORTS, EMAILS FROM CONTACTS, AND ARTICLES ON INTERNET SITES WHEREAS ONLY 7% WERE THROUGH PUBMED. ABOUT 60% FELT THESE STUDIES HELPED THEM IN GENERAL TEACHING WHEREAS 20% SAID THAT SUCH STUDIES HAD NOT REALLY INFLUENCED IT IN ANY WAY. CONCLUSION: THIS SURVEY PROVIDES A BASIC PICTURE OF A GENERAL LACK OF AWARENESS OF YOGA RESEARCH AMONGST PRACTICING YOGA TEACHERS AND THERAPISTS. THOUGH A MAJORITY AGREE RESEARCH IS IMPORTANT, FEW SERIOUSLY UPDATE THEMSELVES ON THIS THROUGH SCIENTIFIC CHANNELS. WITH REGARD TO FUTURE STUDIES, MOST WANTED "PROOF" THAT COULD BE USED TO CONVINCE POTENTIAL CLIENTS AND FELT THAT MORE QUALITATIVE METHODS SHOULD BE APPLIED.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
8  156  31 A QUALITATIVE STUDY OF LOVEYOURBRAIN YOGA: A GROUP-BASED YOGA WITH PSYCHOEDUCATION INTERVENTION TO FACILITATE COMMUNITY INTEGRATION FOR PEOPLE WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. PURPOSE: TO EXPLORE PARTICIPANTS' EXPERIENCES IN A GROUP-BASED YOGA WITH PSYCHOEDUCATION INTERVENTION DESIGNED TO FACILITATE COMMUNITY INTEGRATION FOR PEOPLE WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS.MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE CONDUCTED SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH 13 PEOPLE WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND THREE CAREGIVERS WHO HAD COMPLETED LOVEYOURBRAIN YOGA, A 6-SESSION, MANUALIZED, GROUP-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION THAT INCORPORATES BREATHING EXERCISES, YOGA, MEDITATION, AND PSYCHOEDUCATION. INTERVIEWS WERE ANALYZED USING CONTENT ANALYSIS.RESULTS: WE IDENTIFIED SEVEN THEMES: EASE OF PARTICIPATION, BELONGING, SUSTAINING COMMUNITY CONNECTION, PHYSICAL HEALTH, SELF-REGULATION, SELF-EFFICACY, AND RESILIENCE. ALL PARTICIPANTS VALUED THE COMMUNITY-BASED YOGA STUDIO ENVIRONMENT AND MULTIFACETED STRUCTURE OF THE PROGRAM. PARTICIPANTS REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN STRENGTH, BALANCE, FLEXIBILITY, AND ATTENTION CONTROL, AND A GREATER SENSE OF BELONGING, COMMUNITY CONNECTION, AND ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR LIVES. PARTICIPANTS REPORTED ONGOING USE OF TOOLS (E.G., BREATHING EXERCISES) TO COPE WITH NEGATIVE EMOTIONS AND STRESS. ABOUT HALF OF PARTICIPANTS SUSTAINED RELATIONSHIPS BUILT DURING LOVEYOURBRAIN YOGA AND FELT MORE CAPABLE OF ACCESSING OTHER ACTIVITIES IN THEIR COMMUNITY.CONCLUSIONS: LOVEYOURBRAIN YOGA SUCCESSFULLY PROMOTED COMMUNITY INTEGRATION FOR PEOPLE WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY. IT ALSO FACILITATED DIVERSE AND MEANINGFUL PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND SOCIAL HEALTH BENEFITS, WHICH SUGGEST THAT IT MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE MODE OF COMMUNITY-BASED REHABILITATION.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONTRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY SURVIVORS OFTEN STRUGGLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THEIR COMMUNITY, THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF REHABILITATIONYOGA IS A HOLISTIC THERAPY WITH MANY BENEFITS, YET IS NOT ACCESSIBLE TO THE TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY POPULATION AT THE COMMUNITY LEVELPARTICIPANTS IN A COMMUNITY-BASED YOGA WITH PSYCHOEDUCATION INTERVENTION IN SIX STATES EXPERIENCED DIVERSE AND MEANINGFUL PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, AND SOCIAL HEALTH BENEFITSGROUP-BASED YOGA WITH PSYCHOEDUCATION MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE MODE OF COMMUNITY INTEGRATION AND COMMUNITY-BASED REHABILITATION FOR TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY SURVIVORS.	2020	

9 1577  30 MEANINGS AND PERCEPTIONS OF WOMEN REGARDING THE PRACTICE OF YOGA IN PREGNANCY: A QUALITATIVE STUDY. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: CONSIDERING THAT PREGNANCY TRIGGERS PROFOUND TRANSFORMATIONS IN THE LIFE EXPERIENCE OF WOMEN, AMONG THEM THE NEED TO ADAPT TO A BODY IN A CONSTANT PROCESS OF PHYSIOLOGICAL, PSYCHIC, SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL CHANGE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY TO WHAT EXTENT YOGA CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THIS PROCESS. FOR THIS REASON, THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO COMPREHEND THE MEANINGS AND PERCEPTIONS OF WOMEN REGARDING THE PRACTICE OF YOGA DURING PREGNANCY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A QUALITATIVE AND DESCRIPTIVE STUDY WAS CARRIED OUT WITH NINE WOMEN AT DIFFERENT GESTATIONAL AGES WHO WERE PRACTICING YOGA IN PLACES WITH ALTERNATIVE AND INTEGRATIVE THERAPIES FOR PREGNANT WOMEN LOCATED IN SAO PAULO, BRAZIL. DATA COLLECTION WAS PERFORMED THROUGH SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS AND THE WOMEN'S STATEMENTS WERE TRANSCRIBED, ANALYSED AND GROUPED INTO THREE THEMATIC CATEGORIES. RESULTS: THE ANALYSIS OF THE INTERVIEWS ALLOWED THE IDENTIFICATION OF THREE CATEGORIES 'BENEFITS OF PRACTICING YOGA', 'SELF-KNOWLEDGE, AUTONOMY AND SELF-CARE' AND 'EMPOWERMENT FOR THE MOMENT OF THE BIRTH'. THESE FINDINGS ALLOWED US TO UNDERSTAND HOW THE WOMEN PERCEIVED THE PRACTICE OF YOGA IN THE PREGNANCY AND CONSIDERED IT FUNDAMENTAL TO THE RECOGNITION THAT THEY WERE COMPETENT AND SKILLED TO MANAGE AND CONTROL THEIR BODIES DURING CHILDBIRTH. CONCLUSION: IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT THE PRACTICE OF YOGA PROVIDED PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL BENEFITS FOR THE WOMEN OF THIS STUDY, INCLUDING STRENGTHENING OF THE PELVIC FLOOR, PAIN RELIEF, IMPROVEMENT OF BREATHING, REDUCTION OF STRESS AND ANXIETY, AND STRENGTHENING OF SELF-CONFIDENCE, SELF-ESTEEM AND AUTONOMY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE PREGNANCY AND IN CARING FOR THEMSELVES.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
10    3  23 "I AM A NICE PERSON WHEN I DO YOGA!!!" A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF HOW YOGA AFFECTS RELATIONSHIPS. PURPOSE: TO DEVELOP A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF HOW YOGA PRACTICE AFFECTS ONE'S INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS. DESIGN: QUALITATIVE. METHOD: CONTENT ANALYSIS WAS USED TO QUALITATIVELY ANALYZE WRITTEN COMMENTS (N = 171) MADE REGARDING YOGA IMPROVING INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS IN A LARGE CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY OF YOGA PRACTITIONERS (N = 1,067). FINDINGS: FOUR THEMES WERE IDENTIFIED: YOGA PRACTICE LEADS TO PERSONAL TRANSFORMATION, INCREASES SOCIAL INTERACTION, PROVIDES COPING MECHANISMS TO WEATHER RELATIONSHIP LOSSES AND DIFFICULTIES, AND LEADS TO SPIRITUAL TRANSCENDENCE. PRACTITIONERS BELIEVED THAT THEIR INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS IMPROVED BECAUSE THEIR ATTITUDE AND PERSPECTIVE HAD CHANGED, MAKING THEM MORE PATIENT, KIND, MINDFUL, AND SELF-AWARE. THEY EXPRESSED AN ASPECT OF COMMUNITY THAT WAS BOTH PRACTICAL (THEY MET NEW FRIENDS) AND SPIRITUAL (THEY FELT THEY BELONGED). THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD BETTER WEATHER DIFFICULTIES SUCH AS DIVORCE AND DEATH. A NUMBER DISCUSSED FEELING A SENSE OF PURPOSE AND THAT THEIR PRACTICE CONTRIBUTED TO A GREATER GOOD. CONCLUSIONS: THERE APPEARS TO BE AN ASPECT OF COMMUNITY ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA PRACTICE THAT MAY BE BENEFICIAL TO ONE'S SOCIAL AND SPIRITUAL HEALTH. YOGA COULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR POPULATIONS AT RISK FOR SOCIAL ISOLATION, SUCH AS THOSE WHO ARE ELDERLY, BEREAVED, AND DEPRESSED, AS WELL AS INDIVIDUALS UNDERGOING INTERPERSONAL CRISES.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
11 1284  30 GOT YOGA?: A LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS OF THEMATIC CONTENT AND MODELS' APPEARANCE-RELATED ATTRIBUTES IN ADVERTISEMENTS SPANNING FOUR DECADES OF YOGA JOURNAL. YOGA HAS BECOME AN INCREASINGLY COMMON HEALTH PRACTICE AMONG U.S. ADULTS OVER THE PAST DECADE. WITH THIS GROWTH IN POPULARITY, YOGA-RELATED PRINT MEDIA HAVE BEEN CRITICIZED FOR SHIFTING AWAY FROM YOGA'S TRADITIONAL PHILOSOPHIES AND PROMOTING A THIN, LEAN IDEAL PHYSIQUE REPRESENTING THE "YOGA BODY." THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO (A) ANALYZE THE PRESENCE AND CONTENT OF ADVERTISEMENTS OVER THE 40-YEAR PUBLICATION HISTORY OF YOGA JOURNAL MAGAZINE AND (B) EXPLORE FEMALE ADVERTISEMENT MODELS' SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC AND APPEARANCE-RELATED ATTRIBUTES OVER TIME. RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT YOGA JOURNAL NOW CONTAINS SIGNIFICANTLY MORE ADVERTISEMENTS FOR FOOD, NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS, AND APPAREL AND FEWER ADVERTISEMENTS FOR MEDITATION AND NUTRITIONAL PRACTICES THAN IN ITS EARLY YEARS OF PUBLICATION. MODELS WERE MORE FREQUENTLY RATED AS WHITE AND IN THEIR 20S AND 30S IN RECENT YEARS OF PUBLICATION. TRENDS IN MODEL BODY SIZE MATCHED SHIFTS IN CULTURALLY DOMINANT BODY IDEALS OVER TIME. IMPLICATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS ARE CONSIDERED.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
12 1715  27 PERCEIVED MECHANISMS OF CHANGE IN THERAPEUTIC YOGA TARGETING PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. INTRODUCTION: THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO INVESTIGATE YOGA TEACHERS' AND YOGA THERAPISTS' PERCEPTIONS OF THE WAYS YOGA IS APPLIED TO TREAT SYMPTOMS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, AND IDENTIFY THE DEFINING FEATURES, MAIN COMPONENTS, AND MECHANISMS OF CHANGE IN THERAPEUTIC PRACTICE. METHODS: A QUALITATIVE DESIGN WAS EMPLOYED. SIX YOGA TEACHERS WHO HAD SPECIFIC TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE IN TEACHING THERAPEUTIC YOGA OR PRACTICING 'YOGA THERAPY' TOOK PART IN ONE-TO-ONE INTERVIEWS DURING WHICH THEY GAVE ACCOUNTS OF THEIR EXPERIENCES OF HELPING PEOPLE COPE WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS THROUGH YOGA. PARTICIPANTS' INTERVIEWS WERE TRANSCRIBED VERBATIM AND WERE ANALYSED USING AN INTEGRATIVE INDUCTIVE-DEDUCTIVE THEMATIC ANALYSIS. RESULTS: FOUR KEY THEMES WERE IDENTIFIED IN RELATION TO THE BENEFITS OF THERAPEUTIC YOGA: AWARENESS, CHOICE, RELATIONSHIPS, AND TAILORING. CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS SUPPORT PREVIOUS RESEARCH WHICH SUGGESTS THAT INDIVIDUALISED YOGA THERAPY IS A PROMISING INTERVENTION, AND MAY HELP TO FORM A THEORETICAL RATIONALE FOR THE FUTURE TREATMENT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS WITH YOGA.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
13   20  27 "WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER": A QUALITATIVE STUDY OF PREDOMINANTLY LOW INCOME MINORITY PARTICIPANTS IN A YOGA TRIAL FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. OBJECTIVE: TO EXPLORE THE EXPERIENCES OF LOW-INCOME MINORITY ADULTS TAKING PART IN A YOGA DOSING TRIAL FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. DESIGN: INDIVIDUAL SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH NINETEEN PARTICIPANTS RECRUITED FROM A RANDOMIZED YOGA DOSING TRIAL FOR PREDOMINANTLY LOW-INCOME MINORITY ADULTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. INTERVIEWS DISCUSSED THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON LOW BACK PAIN AND EMOTIONS; OTHER PERCEIVED ADVANTAGES OR DISADVANTAGES OF THE INTERVENTION; AND FACILITATORS AND BARRIERS TO PRACTICING YOGA. INTERVIEWS WERE AUDIO TAPED AND TRANSCRIBED, CODED USING ATLAS.TI SOFTWARE, AND ANALYZED WITH INDUCTIVE AND DEDUCTIVE THEMATIC ANALYSIS METHODS. SETTING: BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER, BOSTON, MA, USA. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS VIEWED YOGA AS A MEANS OF PAIN RELIEF AND ATTRIBUTED IMPROVED MOOD, GREATER ABILITY TO MANAGE STRESS, AND ENHANCED RELAXATION TO YOGA. OVERALL, PARTICIPANTS FELT EMPOWERED TO SELF-MANAGE THEIR PAIN. SOME FOUND YOGA TO BE HELPFUL IN BEING MINDFUL OF THEIR EMOTIONS AND ACCEPTING OF THEIR PAIN. TRUST IN THE YOGA INSTRUCTORS WAS A COMMONLY CITED FACILITATOR FOR YOGA CLASS ATTENDANCE. LACK OF TIME, MOTIVATION, AND FEAR OF INJURY WERE REPORTED BARRIERS TO YOGA PRACTICE. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA IS A MULTIDIMENSIONAL TREATMENT FOR LOW BACK PAIN THAT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO FAVORABLY IMPACT HEALTH IN A PREDOMINANTLY LOW-INCOME MINORITY POPULATION.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
14  250  26 A YOGA INTERVENTION PROGRAM FOR PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM SYMPTOMS OF POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER: A QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTIVE STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO UNDERSTAND HOW INDIVIDUALS WITH SYMPTOMS OF POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) PERCEIVE A TRAUMA-SENSITIVE KUNDALINI YOGA (KY) PROGRAM. METHODS: DIGITALLY RECORDED TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS 30-60 MINUTES IN DURATION WERE CONDUCTED WITH 40 INDIVIDUALS WITH PTSD PARTICIPATING IN AN 8-WEEK KY TREATMENT PROGRAM. INTERVIEWS WERE TRANSCRIBED VERBATIM AND ANALYZED USING QUALITATIVE THEMATIC ANALYSIS TECHNIQUES. RESULTS: QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS IDENTIFIES THREE MAJOR THEMES: SELF-OBSERVED CHANGES, NEW AWARENESS, AND THE YOGA PROGRAM ITSELF. FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT PARTICIPANTS NOTED CHANGES IN AREAS OF HEALTH AND WELL-BEING, LIFESTYLE, PSYCHOSOCIAL INTEGRATION, AND PERCEPTIONS OF SELF IN RELATION TO THE WORLD. PRESENTED ARE PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS FOR TRAUMA-RELATED PROGRAMMING. CONCLUSION: THERE IS A NEED TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE AND POTENTIALLY EMPOWERING APPROACHES TO TRAUMA TREATMENT. YOGA-RELATED SELF-CARE OR SELF-MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES ARE WIDELY ACCESSIBLE, ARE EMPOWERING, AND MAY ADDRESS THE MIND-BODY ELEMENTS OF PTSD.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
15  421  29 BRIDGING BODY AND MIND: CONSIDERATIONS FOR TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA. INDIVIDUALS WHO SUFFER FROM TRAUMA-RELATED SYMPTOMS ARE A UNIQUE POPULATION THAT COULD BENEFIT FROM THE MIND-BODY PRACTICE OF YOGA-OR HAVE THEIR SYMPTOMS REACTIVATED BY IT, DEPENDING ON THE TYPE OF YOGA. TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA (TIY), THAT IS, YOGA ADAPTED TO THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS WORKING TO OVERCOME TRAUMA, MAY AMELIORATE SYMPTOMS BY CREATING A SAFE, TAILORED PRACTICE FOR STUDENTS TO LEARN HOW TO RESPOND, RATHER THAN REACT, TO SYMPTOMS AND CIRCUMSTANCES. YOGA NOT THUS ADAPTED, ON THE OTHER HAND, MAY INCREASE REACTIVITY AND ACTIVATE SYMPTOMS SUCH AS HYPERAROUSAL OR DISSOCIATION. THIS ARTICLE REPORTS ON EXPERT INPUT ABOUT ADAPTING YOGA FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH TRAUMA, WITH SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR MILITARY POPULATIONS. ELEVEN EXPERTS, RECRUITED BASED ON LITERATURE REVIEW AND REFERRALS, WERE INTERVIEWED IN PERSON OR VIA TELEPHONE AND ASKED SEVEN QUESTIONS ABOUT TRAUMA-INFORMED YOGA. VERBATIM TRANSCRIPTS WERE SUBJECTED TO OPEN-CODING THEMATIC ANALYSIS AND A PRIORI THEMES. FINDINGS REVEALED THAT TIY NEEDS TO EMPHASIZE BENEFICIAL PRACTICES (E.G., DIAPHRAGMATIC BREATH AND RESTORATIVE POSTURES), CONSIDER CONTRAINDICATIONS (E.G., AVOIDING SEQUENCES THAT OVERLY ENGAGE THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM), ADAPT TO LIMITATIONS AND CHALLENGES FOR TEACHING IN UNCONVENTIONAL SETTINGS (E.G., PRISONS, VA HOSPITALS), AND PROVIDE SPECIALIZED TRAINING AND PREPARATION (E.G., SPECIALIZED TIY CERTIFICATIONS, SELF-CARE OF INSTRUCTORS/THERAPISTS, ADAPTIONS FOR STUDENT NEEDS). TIY FOR VETERANS MUST ADDITIONALLY CONSIDER GENDER- AND CULTURE-RELATED BARRIERS, DIFFERING RELATIONSHIPS TO PAIN AND INJURY, AND MEDICATION AS A BARRIER TO PRACTICE.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
16   27  23 'IT DEFINITELY MADE A DIFFERENCE': A GROUNDED THEORY STUDY OF YOGA FOR PREGNANCY AND WOMEN'S SELF-EFFICACY FOR LABOUR. OBJECTIVE: TO EXPLORE WOMEN'S EXPERIENCE OF ATTENDING YOGA FOR PREGNANCY CLASSES IN ORDER TO GENERATE A THEORY ABOUT WHICH ASPECTS, IF ANY, ARE EFFECTIVE IN ENHANCING SELF-EFFICACY FOR LABOUR AND BIRTH. DESIGN: A LONGITUDINAL GROUNDED THEORY STUDY. METHODS: SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE UNDERTAKEN WITH WOMEN BEFORE THEY STARTED YOGA FOR PREGNANCY CLASSES, AFTER THEY HAD ATTENDED AT LEAST SIX CLASSES, AND FINALLY, POSTNATALLY. INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPTS WERE ANALYSED USING CONSTRUCTIVE GROUNDED THEORY AND A SELF-EFFICACY FRAMEWORK. SETTING: THREE YOGA FOR PREGNANCY TEACHERS' CLASSES IN ENGLAND. PARTICIPANTS: TWENTY TWO WOMEN ATTENDING YOGA FOR PREGNANCY CLASSES. FINDINGS: ANALYSIS OF INTERVIEWS WITH WOMEN AT THREE TIME POINTS LED TO A PROPOSITIONAL THEORY THAT YOGA FOR PREGNANCY ENHANCES WOMEN'S SELF-EFFICACY FOR LABOUR BY BUILDING THEIR CONFIDENCE AND COMPETENCE THROUGH A COMBINATION OF TECHNIQUES. THESE INCLUDE REPEATED PRACTICE OF A VARIETY OF PAIN MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES, USE OF AFFIRMING LANGUAGE AND THE TELLING OF POSITIVE LABOUR STORIES, UNDERPINNED BY YOGA PRACTICE TO LOWER SOMATIC RESPONSE TO STRESS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
17   10  26 "MAKING IT OKAY": PROFESSIONALS IN HIGH-STRESS ENVIRONMENTS CONSTRUCT THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF THE IMPACT OF A YOGA-BASED RETREAT DESIGNED TO BUILD RESILIENCE. PURPOSE: WHILE THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE FOR RESILIENCE BUILDING PROGRAMMES, TO DATE RESEARCH HAS NOT EXPLORED HOW PROFESSIONALS CONSTRUCT UNDERSTANDING OF PROGRAMME IMPACT. RISE (RESILIENCE, INTEGRATION, SELF-AWARENESS, ENGAGEMENT), A 5-DAY YOGA-BASED RETREAT PROGRAMME, HAS BEEN LINKED WITH POSITIVE WELLNESS OUTCOMES. THIS QUALITATIVE INQUIRY EXPLORES PARTICIPANTS' REFLECTION AND EXPERIENCE 3 MONTHS AFTER PROGRAMME COMPLETION. METHODS: THROUGH A GROUNDED CONSTRUCTIVIST LENS, IN-DEPTH SEMI-STRUCTURED PHONE INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH 17 ADULT PROFESSIONALS IN HIGH-STRESS WORK ENVIRONMENTS WHO ATTENDED RISE. INITIAL HAND-CODING INFORMED CODEBOOK DEVELOPMENT FOR SYSTEMATIC CODING USING DIRECTED CONTENT ANALYSIS USING SENSITIZING STRUCTURING. RESULTS: TWO INTEGRATED PERCEPTIONS WOVEN THROUGH FIVE THEMES. PERSISTENT THREADS OF EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING AND SENSE OF PERMISSION PROVIDED STRUCTURE FOR THEMES FOUND. FIVE INTERRELATED THEMES RELATED TO PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH AND WORKPLACE DYNAMICS WERE (1) USE OF ACQUIRED BEHAVIOURAL SKILLS AND PRACTICES; (2) LIVED MINDFULNESS; (3) RESILIENCE TO STRESS AND EMOTION REGULATION (4) SELF-CARE AND SELF-COMPASSION, AND (5) SHARING WITH OTHERS. CONCLUSION: FINDINGS PROVIDE MEANINGFUL INTERPRETATION OF PREVIOUSLY REPORTED PROGRAMME EFFICACY BY CONTEXTUALIZING PERCEIVED BENEFITS WITHIN PARTICIPANTS' CONSTRUCTED UNDERSTANDING OF CHANGE. SPECIFICALLY, ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, AND EXPERIENTIAL CONSIDERATIONS HAVE SUGGESTED IMPLICATIONS FOR RESILIENCE BUILDING PROGRAMMES.ABBREVIATIONS: RISE (RESILIENCE, INTEGRATION, SELF-AWARENESS, ENGAGEMENT).	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
18    8  21 "I'M 100% FOR IT! I'M A CONVERT!": WOMEN'S EXPERIENCES OF A YOGA PROGRAMME DURING TREATMENT FOR GYNAECOLOGICAL CANCER; AN INTERPRETATIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVES: TO EXPLORE PATIENTS' EXPERIENCES OF TAKING PART IN A YOGA INTERVENTION WHILE UNDERGOING TREATMENT FOR GYNAECOLOGICAL CANCER. DESIGN: SIXTEEN WOMEN (AGE RANGE 31-79 YEARS; MEAN AGE 60) PARTICIPATED IN FOCUS GROUPS BASED ON A SEMI-STRUCTURED QUESTION SCHEDULE. RESULTING DISCUSSIONS WERE AUDIO-RECORDED, TRANSCRIBED VERBATIM AND ANALYSED USING INTERPRETATIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL ANALYSIS (IPA). SETTING: ROYAL DERBY HOSPITAL, UK. INTERVENTIONS: PATIENTS TOOK PART IN A 10-WEEK COURSE OF HATHA YOGA, WHERE THEY PARTICIPATED IN A ONE HOUR LONG CLASS PER WEEK. RESULTS: THREE THEMES EMERGED FROM THE DATA: APPLYING BREATHING TECHNIQUES, ENGAGING IN THE PHYSICALITY OF YOGA AND FINDING A COMMUNITY. THE FIRST THEME WAS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO THE PATIENTS AS THEY NOTED THE BREADTH AND APPLICABILITY OF THE TECHNIQUES IN THEIR DAY-TO-DAY LIVES. THE LATTER TWO THEMES REFLECT PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL PERSPECTIVES, WHICH ARE ESTABLISHED TOPICS IN THE CANCER AND YOGA LITERATURE AND ARE CONTEXTUALISED HERE WITHIN THE WOMEN'S EXPERIENCES OF CANCER TREATMENT. CONCLUSIONS: THE WOMEN'S PERCEPTIONS OF THE PROGRAMME WERE GENERALLY POSITIVE, PROVIDING A PREVIOUSLY UNSEEN VIEW OF THE PATIENT EXPERIENCE OF PARTICIPATING IN A YOGA INTERVENTION. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE WOMEN'S PRIOR EXPECTATIONS AND LIVED EXPERIENCES IS DISCUSSED.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
19  376  23 BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO YOGA USE IN A POPULATION OF INDIVIDUALS WITH SELF-REPORTED CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: A QUALITATIVE APPROACH. YOGA HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE EFFICACIOUS IN TREATING CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN, YET BIOMEDICAL TREATMENTS ARE MOST COMMONLY USED FOR PAIN. PROMOTING YOGA AS PART OF INTEGRATIVE CARE WOULD REDUCE EXCLUSIVE RELIANCE ON HIGH-COST, HIGHER-RISK BIOMEDICAL TREATMENTS. ATTITUDES TOWARD YOGA PLAY A ROLE IN CONSIDERATION OF IT AS A TREATMENT. THE CURRENT STUDY EXAMINED ATTITUDES TOWARD YOGA IN ADULTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN AND COMPARED THESE RESULTS TO THOSE FOUND IN A 2009 GENERAL POPULATION STUDY. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED A SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW WHERE THEY RESPONDED TO ITEMS ABOUT PERCEPTIONS OF POTENTIAL BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO TRYING YOGA. PARTICIPANT RESPONSES WERE ANALYZED QUALITATIVELY AND SEVERAL COMMON THEMES EMERGED. THEMES IDENTIFIED BY PARTICIPANTS INDICATED THERE IS MIXED INFORMATION ABOUT YOGA IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN AND THAT CLARIFICATION OF WHAT YOGA IS, HOW IT CAN BE BENEFICIAL, AND WHAT IT REQUIRES ONE TO DO PHYSICALLY MAY HELP PROMOTE ITS USE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
20  313  28 AN EXPLORATORY STUDY OF THE ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF YOGA AMONG WOMEN IN SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER RECOVERY. OBJECTIVES: THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY EXPLORED THE ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF YOGA AMONG WOMEN IN SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER (SUD) RECOVERY. DESIGN: SEVENTEEN WOMEN IN SUD RECOVERY FOR 2 WEEKS OR LONGER WERE RECRUITED FROM NINE SITES IN THE MID-SOUTH, INCLUDING A MEDICATION-ASSISTED TREATMENT CLINIC IN A HOSPITAL SETTING, PRISON RE-ENTRY HOUSING, COMMUNITY-BASED PEER SUPPORT ORGANIZATIONS (E.G., ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS [AA], NARCOTICS ANONYMOUS [NA]), A RESIDENTIAL SUD TREATMENT FACILITY, A YOGA TEACHERS' ONLINE GROUP, AND THROUGH REFERRALS. THE MEDIAN AGE OF PARTICIPANTS WAS 41.5, WITH AGES RANGING FROM 25 TO 65. WE USED AN INTERPRETIVE DESCRIPTION APPROACH TO EXPLORE BOTH THE PERCEPTIONS OF WOMEN WITHOUT YOGA EXPERIENCE AND THE EXPERIENCES OF WOMEN WITH YOGA EXPERIENCE TO COLLECT FORMATIVE DATA FOR INTERVENTION DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION. THE INTERVIEWS WERE RECORDED AND TRANSCRIBED VERBATIM. A HYBRID ANALYSIS (I.E., INDUCTIVE AND DEDUCTIVE CODING) WAS APPLIED TO THE DATA. RESULTS: WOMEN'S NARRATIVES INCLUDED A HIGH PREVALENCE OF TRAUMA EXPOSURE. OVERALL, WOMEN IN THIS SAMPLE WERE INTERESTED IN EITHER BEGINNING OR CONTINUING YOGA. BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATION INCLUDED PERCEIVED LACK OF SELF-EFFICACY OF YOGA, WEIGHT, AND PHYSICAL INJURIES. ADDITIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL BARRIERS INCLUDED BALANCING CARE OF SELF WITH CARING FOR OTHERS, INCLUDING PARTNERS, CHILDREN, AND NA/AA SPONSEES; AS WELL AS PRIORITIZING FINANCES, HOUSING, EMPLOYMENT, AND TRANSPORTATION. CONCLUSION: HIGH PREVALENCE OF TRAUMA EXPOSURE AMONG WOMEN IN SUD RECOVERY NECESSITATES CAREFUL CONSIDERATION OF CO-OCCURRING PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS SUCH AS POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION AND THE NECESSARY PROFESSIONAL PSYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORT, AS WELL AS SERIOUS PHYSICAL INJURIES THAT REQUIRE MODIFICATION IN YOGA ASANA CLASSES. AS TRANSPORTATION AND BALANCING CARE NEEDS WERE SALIENT IN THESE DATA, RURAL SUD POPULATIONS COULD BE SERVED WITH TELEHEALTH INTERVENTIONS THAT PROVIDE SUD RECOVERY SUPPORT WITH INTEGRATIVE HEALTH PRACTICES SUCH AS ADJUNCTIVE YOGA INTERVENTIONS.	2021

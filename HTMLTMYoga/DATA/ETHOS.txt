4  409  17 BLENDING MARTIAL ARTS AND YOGA FOR HEALTH: FROM THE LAST SAMURAI TO THE FIRST ODAKA YOGA WARRIOR. THIS PAPER INTRODUCES THE CASE STUDY OF ODAKA YOGA, AN INNOVATIVE STYLE OF POSTURAL YOGA BLENDED WITH MARTIAL ARTS ELEMENTS WHICH EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF PRACTITIONERS' HEALTH AND PROCESSES OF SELF-TRANSFORMATION AS PIVOTAL TO THE SCHOOL'S ETHOS. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE PAPER EXPLORES HOW ODAKA YOGA'S PHILOSOPHICAL BACKDROPS AND PRACTICAL REPERTOIRE, COMPOSED BY A MIXTURE OF "EXOTIC" RESOURCES SUCH AS BUSHIDO, ZEN, YOGA, AND A CONSTANT REFERENCE TO THE OCEAN WAVES AND BIOMECHANICS, CONSTITUTE A VERY SPECIFIC VISION OF HEALTH AT THE INTERSECTION OF WESTERN SCIENCE AND ESOTERIC KNOWLEDGE. THEORETICALLY, THE PAPER BORROWS FROM JENNINGS' THEORY OF MARTIAL CREATION AND ENRICHES IT WITH SOME OF THE CENTRAL ANALYTICAL TOOLS PROPOSED BY THEORISTS SUCH AS BOURDIEU AND FOUCAULT. METHODOLOGICALLY, IT RELIES ON A MULTIMODAL APPROACH INCLUDING DISCURSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE SCHOOL'S PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS, INTERVIEWS WITH THE FOUNDERS AND OTHER KEY TEACHERS, AND OBSERVANT PARTICIPATION OF PRACTITIONERS' APPRENTICESHIP PROCESSES. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE BIRTH OF ODAKA YOGA AS OCCURRING AT THE INTERSECTION OF ASIAN MARTIAL ARTS AND YOGA, AS WELL AS THE FOUNDERS' BIOGRAPHICAL TRAJECTORIES FROM THE WORLD OF COMPETITIVE MARTIAL ARTS AND FITNESS, TO YOGA; IT THEN TURNS TO AN EXAMINATION OF ODAKA YOGA'S CONCEPTION OF HEALTH AS A MIXTURE OF THE WESTERN BIOMEDICAL MODEL AND THE SUBTLE BODY MODEL OF ASIAN TRADITIONS SUCH AS YOGA AND MARTIAL ARTS. IT ARGUES THAT THE CONCEPTION OF HEALTH PROMOTED BY THIS SCHOOL GIVES RISE TO THE ODAKA YOGA WARRIOR, THE IDEAL-TYPICAL PRACTITIONER WHOSE BODY IS SIMULTANEOUSLY EXPOSED TO THE MEDICAL GAZE AND ITS IMPERATIVES OF CONTROL, KNOWLEDGE, AND MANIPULATION; WHILE IT ALSO DEIFIES IT, AS IT IS ANIMATED BY THE ELUSIVE FLOWS OF ENERGY (QI OR PRANA) THAT PROLONGED PRACTICE AIMS TO MASTER. THE PAPER CONCLUDES WITH A REFLECTION ON HYBRID CONCEPTIONS OF HEALTH AND THE UBIQUITOUS ROLE OF HEALTH DISCOURSES AND NARRATIVES ACROSS SOCIOCULTURAL DOMAINS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
5  317  32 AN INTEGRATED METHODOLOGY TO ASSESS COMPLIANCE WITH DELPHI SURVEY KEY COMPONENTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS AS APPLIED IN A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF FIBROMYALGIA STUDIES. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS ARTICLE WAS TO PRESENT A METHODOLOGY INCORPORATING EXISTING GUIDELINES AND TOOLS FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND TO EVALUATE THE DELPHI SURVEY 33 KEY COMPONENT RECOMMENDATIONS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS AS A TOOL FOR A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW IN FIBROMYALGIA STUDIES. DATA SOURCES: DATABASES SEARCHED INCLUDED PUBMED, OVID MEDLINE, PSYCHINFO, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, CINAHL, ALT HEALTHWATCH, PEDRO, AND WEB OF SCIENCE. ARTICLE SELECTION: SELECTED WERE ARTICLES PUBLISHED BETWEEN NOVEMBER 14, 2004 AND NOVEMBER 13, 2014, WRITTEN IN ENGLISH, REPORTING ORIGINAL RESEARCH OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR ADULTS WITH FIBROMYALGIA. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: SIX ARTICLES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA, REVEALING THAT THREE YOGA STYLES ("RELAXING" YOGA, YOGA OF AWARENESS, AND HATHA YOGA) HAVE BEEN ASSESSED IN PERSONS WITH FIBROMYALGIA. OVERALL, REPORTING COMPLIANCE WITH THE 33 KEY COMPONENTS RANGED FROM 39.4% TO 84.8%, WITH A MEAN ADHERENCE RATE OF 62.63% +/- 17.74. NONE OF THE AUTHORS USED AN ACCEPTED REPORTING GUIDELINE; SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OF ASANA, PRANAYAMA, RELAXATION, AND MINDFULNESS PRACTICES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE INTERVENTIONS TESTED WERE IDENTIFIED IN ONLY 33.33% OF THE ARTICLES REVIEWED; AND NONE OF THE ARTICLES INCLUDED DETAILED, REPLICABLE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE INTERVENTIONS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW SUPPORTS THE NEED FOR COMPREHENSIVE YOGA RESEARCH GUIDELINES. FINDINGS REVEAL A LACK OF REPORTING OF INTERVENTION DETAILS, THE NEED TO REPORT A DISEASE-SPECIFIC RATIONALE FOR SELECTION OF THE PARTICULAR YOGA STYLE USED FOR THE INTERVENTION, AND THAT A LIMITED NUMBER OF YOGA STYLES HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED IN PERSONS WITH FIBROMYALGIA.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
6 2130  37 THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA TO PREVENT DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2: A PROTOCOL FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM) IS BECOMING A LEADING PROBLEM WORLDWIDE. EMERGING REPORTS REVEAL ALARMING EVIDENCE OF INCREASING PREVALENCE OF T2DM THAT HAS REACHED PANDEMIC LEVELS. DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT INCIDENCE, THERE ARE LIMITED RELIABLE DATA RESOURCES AND COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PEOPLE WHO ARE A PREDIABETIC OR HIGH RISK FOR DEVELOPING T2DM. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROTOCOL IS TO CONDUCT A FULL-SCALE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSES ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PEOPLE WHO ARE PREDIABETES OR HIGH RISK OF DEVELOPING T2DM. METHODS: THE ARTICLES ENROLLED IN THE STUDY WILL BE RETRIEVED FROM THE ONLINE DATABASES BETWEEN 2002 AND THE DATE THE SEARCHES ARE EXECUTED. THE SEARCHES WILL BE REPEATED JUST BEFORE THE FINAL ANALYSES AND FURTHER RELEVANT STUDIES FOR INCLUSION. WE WILL CONDUCT A BIBLIOGRAPHIC SEARCH IN DATABASES: MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, COCHRANE LIBRARY, EBSCO, AND INDMED USING KEYWORDS INCLUDING PREDIABETES STATE, HIGH RISK FOR DIABETES, METABOLIC SYNDROME, AND YOGA. A DEFINED SEARCH STRATEGY WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ALONG WITH SELECTION CRITERIA TO OBTAIN FULL-TEXT ARTICLES OF RELEVANT STUDIES. THIS STUDY PROTOCOL WAS PREPARED ACCORDING TO THE PREFERRED REPORTING ITEMS FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND META-ANALYSIS FOR PROTOCOLS 2015 GUIDELINES. THERE WILL BE NO LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL BE BASED ON PUBLISHED STUDIES AND PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ANONYMIZED DATA WITHOUT DIRECTLY INVOLVING HUMAN PARTICIPANTS AND THEREFORE REQUIRES NEITHER FORMAL HUMAN ETHICAL REVIEW NOR APPROVAL BY A HUMAN RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEE. WE PUBLISHED AN OUTLINE OF THE PROTOCOL IN THE INTERNATIONAL PROSPECTIVE REGISTER OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS (PROSPERO) IN 2018. WE PLAN TO DISSEMINATE THE FINDINGS OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS THROUGH PUBLICATION IN A PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL AND PRESENTATION AT RELEVANT CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS. IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE THE RESULTS OF THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WILL HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND PRACTICE. WE WILL PREPARE POLICYMAKER SUMMARY USING A VALIDATED FORMAT, DISSEMINATE THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA AND EMAIL DISCUSSION GROUPS.

7 2121  38 THE EFFECTIVENESS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF PREGNANCY YOGA INTERVENTIONS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW PROTOCOL. BACKGROUND: THE PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW IS TO SYSTEMATICALLY EXAMINE THE REPORTED CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF PREGNANCY YOGA. THE REVIEW WILL USE THE FITT (FREQUENCY, INTENSITY, TIME/DURATION AND TYPE) PRINCIPLE OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO CHARACTERISE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN EVALUATED IN THE INCLUDED STUDIES. STUDIES WILL BE CATEGORISED AS EFFECTIVENESS OR EFFICACY STUDIES AND THIS CONTINUUM OF EFFICACY VERSUS EFFECTIVENESS WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE FULL REVIEW. METHODS/DESIGN: THE FOLLOWING ELECTRONIC DATABASES WILL BE SEARCHED USING A DETAILED SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, WHOLIS, AMED, SCIELO, ASSIA AND WEB OF SCIENCE. RANDOMISED CONTROL TRIALS AND QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES EXAMINING PREGNANCY YOGA AND REPORTING ON EFFECT WILL BE INCLUDED. TITLES, ABSTRACTS AND FULL ARTICLES WILL BE SCREENED BY TWO INVESTIGATORS INDEPENDENTLY TO IDENTIFY ELIGIBLE STUDIES. THE COCHRANE COLLABORATION'S RISK OF BIAS ASSESSMENT TOOL WILL BE USED TO ASSESS STUDY QUALITY. QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE WILL BE EVALUATED USING THE GRADE CRITERIA. A STANDARDISED DATA EXTRACTION FORM WILL BE USED TO EXTRACT DATA. EFFECT SIZES WILL BE ESTIMATED USING MEAN DIFFERENCES FOR CONTINUOUS OUTCOMES, AND RELATIVE RISKS FOR DICHOTOMOUS OUTCOME. WHERE POSSIBLE, POOLING OF EFFECT ESTIMATES WILL BE DONE USING A RANDOM EFFECT MODEL. THE OUTCOMES OF INTEREST ARE QUALITY OF LIFE, STRESS, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, MODE OF BIRTH, LABOUR DURATION AND PAIN MANAGEMENT IN LABOUR. DISCUSSION: THIS REVIEW WILL SYNTHESISE THE BEST AVAILABLE EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA DURING PREGNANCY AND PROVIDE VALUABLE HIGH-QUALITY INFORMATION FOR CLINICIANS AND HEALTH POLICYMAKERS. FINDINGS WILL BE DISSEMINATED THROUGH PUBLICATION IN A PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL AND PRESENTATION AT RELEVANT CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS. THE REVIEW WILL MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE APPROPRIATE VOLUME, INTENSITY AND TYPE OF PREGNANCY YOGA FOR MAXIMUM EFFECT AND MAY HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND PRACTICE RELATING TO PREGNANCY YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION.

8 1189  28 EVIDENCE ON YOGA FOR HEALTH: A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS. OBJECTIVE: TO SUPPORT THE RESEARCH AGENDA IN YOGA FOR HEALTH BY COMPREHENSIVELY IDENTIFYING SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF YOGA FOR HEALTH OUTCOMES AND CONDUCTING A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS TO DESCRIBE THEIR PUBLICATION CHARACTERISTICS AND TOPIC COVERAGE. METHODS: WE SEARCHED 7 DATABASES (MEDLINE/PUBMED, EMBASE, PSYCINFO, CINAHL, AMED, THE COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS, AND PROSPERO) FROM THEIR INCEPTION TO NOVEMBER 2019 AND 1 DATABASE (INDMED) FROM INCEPTION TO JANUARY 2017. TWO AUTHORS INDEPENDENTLY SCREENED EACH RECORD FOR INCLUSION AND ONE AUTHOR EXTRACTED PUBLICATION CHARACTERISTICS AND TOPICS OF INCLUDED REVIEWS. RESULTS: WE RETRIEVED 2710 RECORDS AND INCLUDED 322 SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS. 157 REVIEWS WERE EXCLUSIVELY ON YOGA, AND 165 WERE ON YOGA AS ONE OF A LARGER CLASS OF INTERVENTIONS (E.G., EXERCISE). MOST REVIEWS WERE PUBLISHED IN 2012 OR LATER (260/322; 81 %). FIRST/CORRESPONDING AUTHORS WERE FROM 32 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES; THREE-QUARTERS WERE FROM THE USA, GERMANY, CHINA, AUSTRALIA, THE UK OR CANADA (240/322; 75 %). REVIEWS WERE MOST FREQUENTLY PUBLISHED IN SPECIALITY JOURNALS (161/322; 50 %) COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE JOURNALS (66/322; 20 %) OR SYSTEMATIC REVIEW JOURNALS (59/322; 18 %). ALMOST ALL WERE PRESENT IN MEDLINE (296/322; 92 %). REVIEWS WERE MOST OFTEN FUNDED BY GOVERNMENT OR NON-PROFITS (134/322; 42 %), UNFUNDED (74/322; 23 %), OR NOT EXPLICIT ABOUT FUNDING (111/322; 34 %). COMMON HEALTH TOPICS WERE PSYCHIATRIC/COGNITIVE (N = 56), CANCER (N = 39) AND MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS (N = 36). MULTIPLE REVIEWS COVERED SIMILAR TOPICS, PARTICULARLY DEPRESSION/ANXIETY (N = 18), BREAST CANCER (N = 21), AND LOW BACK PAIN (N = 16). CONCLUSIONS: FURTHER RESEARCH SHOULD EXPLORE THE OVERALL QUALITY OF REPORTING AND CONDUCT OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF YOGA, THE DIRECTION AND CERTAINTY OF SPECIFIC CONCLUSIONS, AND DUPLICATION OR GAPS IN REVIEW COVERAGE OF TOPICS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
9 1689  28 OVERVIEW OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS: YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION FOR ADULTS WITH ACUTE AND CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS. OBJECTIVES. OVERVIEW THE QUALITY, DIRECTION, AND CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR TREATMENT OF ACUTE AND CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS IN ADULT POPULATIONS. METHODS. WE SEARCHED FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS IN 10 ONLINE DATABASES, BIBLIOGRAPHIC REFERENCES, AND HAND-SEARCHES IN YOGA-RELATED JOURNALS. INCLUDED REVIEWS SATISFY OXMAN CRITERIA AND SPECIFY YOGA AS A PRIMARY INTERVENTION IN ONE OR MORE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS FOR TREATMENT IN ADULTS. THE AMSTAR TOOL AND GRADE APPROACH EVALUATED THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF REVIEWS AND QUALITY OF EVIDENCE. RESULTS. WE IDENTIFIED 2202 TITLES, OF WHICH 41 FULL-TEXT ARTICLES WERE ASSESSED FOR ELIGIBILITY AND 26 SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS SATISFIED INCLUSION CRITERIA. THIRTEEN SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS INCLUDE QUANTITATIVE DATA AND SIX PAPERS INCLUDE META-ANALYSIS. THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE IS GENERALLY LOW. SIXTEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF HEALTH CONDITIONS ARE INCLUDED. ELEVEN REVIEWS SHOW TENDENCY TOWARDS POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTION, 15 REVIEWS REPORT UNCLEAR RESULTS, AND NO, REVIEWS REPORT ADVERSE EFFECTS OF YOGA. YOGA APPEARS MOST EFFECTIVE FOR REDUCING SYMPTOMS IN ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND PAIN. CONCLUSION. ALTHOUGH THE QUALITY OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS IS HIGH, THE QUALITY OF SUPPORTING EVIDENCE IS LOW. SIGNIFICANT HETEROGENEITY AND VARIABILITY IN REPORTING INTERVENTIONS BY TYPE OF YOGA, SETTINGS, AND POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS LIMIT THE GENERALIZABILITY OF RESULTS.	2013

SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS INCLUDE SHORT FOLLOW-UP MEASUREMENTS AND SHORT DURATION OF INTERVENTION.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
11  475  18 CLARIFY 2021: EXPLANATION AND ELABORATION OF THE DELPHI-BASED GUIDELINES FOR THE REPORTING OF YOGA RESEARCH. BACKGROUND: REPORTING OF YOGA RESEARCH OFTEN LACKS THE DETAIL REQUIRED FOR CLINICAL APPLICATION, STUDY REPLICATION, SUMMARY RESEARCH AND COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS STUDIES. METHODS: TO IMPROVE THE TRANSPARENCY OF REPORTING YOGA INTERVENTIONS, AND BUILDING ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF PREVIOUS REPORTING GUIDELINES, A GROUP OF INTERNATIONAL YOGA RESEARCH STAKEHOLDERS DEVELOPED THE CONSENSUS-BASED CHECKLIST STANDARDISING THE REPORTING OF INTERVENTIONS FOR YOGA (CLARIFY) GUIDELINES. RESULTS: THE 21-ITEM CLARIFY CHECKLIST OUTLINES THE MINIMUM DETAILS CONSIDERED NECESSARY FOR HIGH-QUALITY REPORTING OF YOGA RESEARCH. THIS PAPER PROVIDES A DETAILED EXPLANATION OF EACH OF THE 21 ITEMS OF THE CLARIFY CHECKLIST, TOGETHER WITH MODEL EXAMPLES OF HOW TO INTEGRATE EACH ITEM INTO PUBLICATIONS OF YOGA RESEARCH. THE CLARIFY GUIDELINE SERVES AS AN EXTENSION FOR EXISTING RESEARCH REPORTING GUIDELINES, AND IS FLEXIBLE FOR USE ACROSS ALL STUDY DESIGNS. CONCLUSION: WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THE UPTAKE OF THESE REPORTING GUIDELINES BY RESEARCHERS AND JOURNALS, TO FACILITATE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE TRANSPARENCY AND UTILITY OF YOGA RESEARCH.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
12 1064  29 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON IMMUNE FUNCTION: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. OBJECTIVE: THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW ATTEMPTS TO CONFIRM THE ADDED EVIDENCE TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON IMMUNE FUNCTION. METHODS: THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, EMBASE, PSYCINFO, PUBMED, AND WEB OF SCIENCE ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE SEARCHED ACCORDING TO THE PRISRMA METHOD TO IDENTIFY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) ON THE IMMUNOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF YOGA PUBLISHED IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE FROM JANUARY 1, 2017, TO DECEMBER 31, 2020. THIS REVIEW COULD ONLY BE DESCRIPTIVELY SUMMARIZED BECAUSE OF HETEROGENEITY OF THE INCLUDED RCTS. RESULTS: ELEVEN POTENTIAL TRIALS WERE IDENTIFIED AND INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW. QUALITY APPRAISAL OF INCLUDED TRIALS RANGED FROM 3 FOR UNCLEAR RISK OF BIAS AND 8 FOR HIGH RISK OF BIAS. THERE IS EVIDENCE FROM 11 RCTS THAT YOGA MAY HAVE FAVORABLE EFFECTS FOR REDUCING THE LEVELS OF ANTI-INFLAMMATORY MARKERS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA MAY BE USED AS A COMPLEMENTARY INTERVENTION FOR CLINICAL POPULATIONS OR HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
13 1930  21 ROLE OF YOGA IN MANAGEMENT OF SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS: A NARRATIVE REVIEW. SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS ARE COMPARABLE TO CHRONIC MEDICAL ILLNESSES AND HAVE A CHRONIC RELAPSING COURSE. DESPITE BEING SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTORS TO MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY, LIMITED TREATMENT OPTIONS EXIST. THE CURRENT NARRATIVE REVIEW WAS AIMED AT PROVIDING AN OVERVIEW OF YOGA THERAPY IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS AND DISCUSS THE RELEVANT METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES. ARTICLES PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH LANGUAGE TILL MAY 2017 INDEXED WITH PUBMED, PUBMED CENTRAL, AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR WERE SEARCHED USING SEARCH TERMS "YOGA," "SUBSTANCE USE," "DRUG DEPENDENCE," "NICOTINE," "TOBACCO," "ALCOHOL," "OPIOIDS," "CANNABIS," "COCAINE," "STIMULANTS," "SEDATIVE HYPNOTICS," "INHALANTS," AND "HALLUCINOGENS" FOR INCLUSION IN THE REVIEW. A TOTAL OF 314 STUDIES WERE FOUND FULFILLING THE STATED CRITERIA. OUT OF WHICH, 16 STUDIES WERE FOUND TO FULFILL THE INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA AND 12 WERE RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS. THE MAJORITY OF STUDIES WERE AVAILABLE ON THE ROLE OF YOGA IN MANAGEMENT OF NICOTINE DEPENDENCE. SAMPLE SIZE OF THESE STUDIES RANGED FROM 18 TO 624. THE MAJORITY OF STUDIES SUGGESTED THE ROLE OF YOGA IN REDUCING SUBSTANCE USE AS WELL AS SUBSTANCE-RELATED CRAVING (ESPECIALLY IN NICOTINE-USE DISORDERS) IN SHORT TERM. HOWEVER, MORE STUDIES ARE REQUIRED FOR DEMONSTRATING THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDER.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
14  235  31 A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR HELPING HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND STUDENTS. HELPING HEALTH PROFESSIONALS (HHP) AND HHP STUDENTS ARE AMONG THE HIGHEST RISK OCCUPATIONAL GROUPS FOR COMPROMISED MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH. THERE IS A PAUCITY OF INFORMATION REGARDING PREVENTIVE INTERVENTIONS FOR MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH IN THIS GROUP OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR THE PREVENTION AND REDUCTION OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL DISORDERS AMONG HHPS AND HHP STUDENTS. DESIGN: AN EXHAUSTIVE SYSTEMATIC SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED IN MAY 2020. DATABASES SEARCHED IN THE OVID INTERFACE INCLUDED: MEDLINE(R) AND EPUB AHEAD OF PRINT, IN-PROCESS & OTHER NON-INDEXED CITATIONS AND DAILY, EMBASE, AND PSYCINFO. EBSCOHOST DATABASES SEARCHED INCLUDED: CINAHL PLUS WITH FULL TEXT, SPORTDISCUS WITH FULL TEXT, ALT HEALTHWATCH, EDUCATION RESEARCH COMPLETE, SOCINDEX WITH FULL TEXT, ERIC, AND ACADEMIC SEARCH COMPLETE. SCOPUS WAS ALSO SEARCHED. RESULTS: THE SEARCH YIELDED 4,973 RECORDS, AND AFTER REMOVAL OF DUPLICATES 3197 RECORDS REMAINED. USING INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA, TITLES AND ABSTRACTS WERE SCREENED AND FULL TEXT ARTICLES (N = 82) WERE RETRIEVED AND SCREENED. TWENTY-FIVE STUDIES WERE IDENTIFIED FOR INCLUSION IN THIS REVIEW. MOST FREQUENTLY REPORTED FINDINGS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN THIS POPULATION INCLUDED A REDUCTION IN STRESS, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN. CONCLUSION: IT IS OUR CONCLUSION THAT MENTAL AND PHYSICAL BENEFITS CAN BE OBTAINED THROUGH IMPLEMENTATION OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR HHPS AND HHP STUDENTS ACROSS A VARIETY OF SETTINGS AND BACKGROUNDS. HOWEVER, RESEARCHERS WOULD BENEFIT FROM FOLLOWING RECOMMENDED GUIDELINES FOR THE DESIGN AND REPORTING OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE STUDY QUALITY AND RIGOUR.	2021

METHODS: THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, PUBMED, EMBASE, WEB OF SCIENCE, CINAHL AND ELSEVIER DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FROM INCEPTION TO JANUARY 22, 2020, AND RANDOMIZED, QUASI-RANDOMIZED AND NON-RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS EVALUATING THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE DELIVERY OUTCOMES IN PREGNANT WOMEN WERE INCLUDED. THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY WAS ASSESSED BY THE COCHRANE COLLABORATION'S TOOL. META-ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED USING REVMAN 5.3. RESULTS: THIS META-ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED THAT YOGA IMPROVED VAGINAL DELIVERY, DECREASED PREMATURE DELIVERY AND BIRTH WEIGHT OF NEWBORNS, SHORTEN THE LABOR DURATION. CONCLUSION: PRENATAL YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE TO IMPROVE DELIVERY OUTCOMES AND NOT TO INCREASE THE RISK OF FETUS, WHICH IS WORTH RECOMMENDING TO PREGNANT WOMEN. BUT STUDIES INVOLVED IN THIS META-ANALYSIS WERE NOT ALL OF HIGH QUALITY. THE REGISTRATION NUMBER IN PROSPERO IS CRD42019132490.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
16  477  40 CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF YOGA FOR THE PEDIATRIC POPULATION: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EVIDENCE FOR CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF YOGA AMONG THE PEDIATRIC POPULATION. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED AN ELECTRONIC LITERATURE SEARCH INCLUDING CINAHL, COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL), EMBASE, MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, AND MANUAL SEARCH OF RETRIEVED ARTICLES FROM INCEPTION OF EACH DATABASE UNTIL DECEMBER 2008. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) AND NONRANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (NRCTS) WERE SELECTED THAT INCLUDED YOGA OR YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS AGED 0 TO 21 YEARS. DATA WERE EXTRACTED AND ARTICLES CRITICALLY REVIEWED USING A MODIFIED JADAD SCORE AND DESCRIPTIVE METHODOLOGICAL CRITERIA, WITH SUMMARIZATION IN TABLES. RESULTS: THIRTY-FOUR CONTROLLED STUDIES PUBLISHED FROM 1979 TO 2008 WERE IDENTIFIED, WITH 19 RCTS AND 15 NRCTS. MANY STUDIES WERE OF LOW METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY. CLINICAL AREAS FOR WHICH YOGA HAS BEEN STUDIED INCLUDE PHYSICAL FITNESS, CARDIORESPIRATORY EFFECTS, MOTOR SKILLS/STRENGTH, MENTAL HEALTH AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS, BEHAVIOR AND DEVELOPMENT, IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME, AND BIRTH OUTCOMES FOLLOWING PRENATAL YOGA. NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED IN TRIALS REVIEWED. ALTHOUGH A LARGE MAJORITY OF STUDIES WERE POSITIVE, METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS SUCH AS RANDOMIZATION METHODS, WITHDRAWAL/DROPOUTS, AND DETAILS OF YOGA INTERVENTION PRECLUDE CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE. CONCLUSIONS: THERE ARE LIMITED DATA ON THE CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF YOGA AMONG THE PEDIATRIC POPULATION. MOST PUBLISHED CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE SUGGESTIVE OF BENEFIT, BUT RESULTS ARE PRELIMINARY BASED ON LOW QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF TRIALS. FURTHER RESEARCH OF YOGA FOR CHILDREN BY USING A HIGHER STANDARD OF METHODOLOGY AND REPORTING IS WARRANTED.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
17  347  29 ASSESSING FIDELITY OF IMPLEMENTATION (FOI) FOR SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA INTERVENTIONS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. AS SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PROGRAMS GAIN POPULARITY, THE SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF FIDELITY OF PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION (FOI) IS CRITICAL TO PROVIDE A MORE ROBUST UNDERSTANDING OF THE CORE COMPONENTS OF MINDFULNESS AND YOGA INTERVENTIONS, THEIR POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE SPECIFIED TEACHER AND STUDENT OUTCOMES, AND OUR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT THESE PROGRAMS CONSISTENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY. THIS PAPER REVIEWS THE CURRENT STATE OF THE SCIENCE WITH RESPECT TO INCLUSION AND REPORTING OF FOI IN PEER-REVIEWED STUDIES EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND/OR YOGA PROGRAMS TARGETING STUDENTS AND/OR TEACHERS IMPLEMENTED IN GRADES KINDERGARTEN THROUGH TWELVE (K-12) IN NORTH AMERICA. ELECTRONIC SEARCHES IN PSYCHINFO AND WEB OF SCIENCE FROM THEIR INCEPTION THROUGH MAY 2014, IN ADDITION TO HAND SEARCHES OF RELEVANT REVIEW ARTICLES, IDENTIFIED 312 PUBLICATIONS, 48 OF WHICH MET INCLUSION CRITERIA. FINDINGS INDICATED A RELATIVE PAUCITY OF RIGOROUS FOI. FEWER THAN 10% OF STUDIES OUTLINED POTENTIAL CORE PROGRAM COMPONENTS OR REFERENCED A FORMAL THEORY OF ACTION, AND FEWER THAN 20% ASSESSED ANY ASPECT OF FOI BEYOND PARTICIPANT DOSAGE. THE EMERGING NATURE OF THE EVIDENCE BASE PROVIDES A CRITICAL WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY TO GRAPPLE WITH KEY ISSUES RELEVANT TO FOI OF MINDFULNESS-BASED AND YOGA PROGRAMS, INCLUDING IDENTIFYING ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF THESE PROGRAMS THAT SHOULD BE FAITHFULLY IMPLEMENTED AND HOW WE MIGHT DEVELOP RIGOROUS MEASURES TO ACCURATELY CAPTURE THEM. CONSIDERATION OF THESE QUESTIONS AND SUGGESTED NEXT STEPS ARE INTENDED TO HELP ADVANCE THE EMERGING FIELD OF SCHOOL-BASED MINDFULNESS AND YOGA INTERVENTIONS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
18 1737  22 PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND YOGA-BASED APPROACHES FOR PREGNANCY-RELATED LOW BACK AND PELVIC PAIN. OBJECTIVE: TO CONDUCT AN INTEGRATIVE REVIEW TO EVALUATE CURRENT LITERATURE ABOUT NONPHARMACOLOGIC, EASILY ACCESSIBLE MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES FOR PREGNANCY-RELATED LOW BACK AND PELVIC PAIN (PR-LBPP). DATA SOURCES: PUBMED, CINAHL, COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS. STUDY SELECTION: ORIGINAL RESEARCH ARTICLES WERE CONSIDERED FOR REVIEW IF THEY WERE FULL-LENGTH PUBLICATIONS WRITTEN IN ENGLISH AND PUBLISHED IN PEER-REVIEWED JOURNALS FROM 2005 THROUGH 2015, INCLUDED MEASURES OF PAIN AND SYMPTOMS RELATED TO PR-LBPP, AND EVALUATED TREATMENT MODALITIES THAT USED A PHYSICAL EXERCISE OR YOGA-BASED APPROACH FOR THE DESCRIBED CONDITIONS. DATA EXTRACTION: ELECTRONIC DATABASE SEARCHES YIELDED 1,435 ARTICLES. A TOTAL OF 15 ARTICLES MET ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR FURTHER REVIEW. DATA SYNTHESIS: THESE MODALITIES SHOW PRELIMINARY PROMISE FOR PAIN RELIEF AND OTHER RELATED SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING STRESS AND DEPRESSION. HOWEVER, OUR FINDINGS ALSO INDICATE SEVERAL GAPS IN KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THESE THERAPIES FOR PR-LBPP AND METHODOLOGIC ISSUES WITH THE CURRENT LITERATURE. CONCLUSION: ALTHOUGH ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS REQUIRED, THE RESULTS OF THIS INTEGRATIVE REVIEW SUGGEST THAT CLINICIANS MAY CONSIDER RECOMMENDING NONPHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT OPTIONS, SUCH AS GENTLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS, FOR PR-LBPP AND RELATED SYMPTOMS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
19  590  35 DETERMINING THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA IN CHRONIC STROKE CARE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: SURVIVORS OF STROKE HAVE LONG-TERM PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES THAT IMPACT THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE. FEW INTERVENTIONS ARE AVAILABLE IN THE COMMUNITY TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS. YOGA, A TYPE OF MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTION, IS SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN PEOPLE WITH OTHER CHRONIC ILLNESSES AND MAY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE PROBLEMS REPORTED BY SURVIVORS OF STROKE. OBJECTIVES: TO DATE ONLY NARRATIVE REVIEWS HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED. WE SOUGHT TO PERFORM, THE FIRST SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WITH META-ANALYSES OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) THAT INVESTIGATED YOGA FOR ITS POTENTIAL BENEFIT FOR CHRONIC SURVIVORS OF STROKE. METHODS: OVID MEDLINE, CINHAL PLUS, AMED, PUBMED, PSYCHINFO, PEDRO, COCHRANE DATABASE, SPORT DISCUSS, AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR WERE SEARCHED FOR PAPERS PUBLISHED BETWEEN JANUARY 1950 AND AUGUST 2016. REFERENCE LISTS OF INCLUDED PAPERS, REVIEW ARTICLES AND OPENGREY FOR GREY LITERATURE WERE ALSO SEARCHED. WE USED A MODIFIED COCHRANE TOOL TO EVALUATE RISK OF BIAS. THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF RCTS WAS ASSESSED USING THE GRADE APPROACH, RESULTS WERE COLLATED, AND RANDOM EFFECTS META-ANALYSES PERFORMED WHERE APPROPRIATE. RESULTS: THE SEARCH YIELDED FIVE ELIGIBLE PAPERS FROM FOUR RCTS WITH SMALL SAMPLE SIZES (N = 17-47). QUALITY OF RCTS WAS RATED AS LOW TO MODERATE. YOGA IS BENEFICIAL IN REDUCING STATE ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND DEPRESSION IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP (MEAN DIFFERENCES FOR STATE ANXIETY 6.05, 95% CI:-0.02 TO 12.12; P = 0.05 AND STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCES FOR DEPRESSION: 0.50, 95% CI:-0.01 TO 1.02; P = 0.05). CONSISTENT BUT NONSIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE DEMONSTRATED FOR BALANCE, TRAIT ANXIETY, AND OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA MAY BE EFFECTIVE FOR AMELIORATING SOME OF THE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES OF STROKE. LARGE WELL-DESIGNED RCTS ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE FINDINGS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
20 2578  25 YOGA FOR HEALTH CARE IN KOREA: A PROTOCOL FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF CLINICAL TRIALS. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AIMS TO EVALUATE THE THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY USING AN EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH AND INVESTIGATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOGA AND THE MERIDIAN ENERGIES BASED ON ALL AVAILABLE CLINICAL STUDIES IN KOREA. SIXTEEN ELECTRONIC DATABASES WILL BE SEARCHED FROM THE INCEPTION OF THE STUDY UNTIL JANUARY 2016. ALL CLINICAL EVIDENCES THAT EVALUATE ANY TYPE OF YOGA AND ANY TYPE OF CONTROL IN INDIVIDUALS WITH ANY TYPE OF CONDITION WILL BE ELIGIBLE. THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY WILL BE ASSESSED USING THE COCHRANE RISK OF BIAS TOOL FOR RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS AND THE NEWCASTLE-OTTAWA SCALE FOR NONRANDOMIZED STUDIES. TWO AUTHORS WILL INDEPENDENTLY ASSESS EACH STUDY FOR ELIGIBILITY AND THE RISK OF BIAS, AND THEN THEY WILL EXTRACT THE DATA. WITH ITS EXTENSIVE, UNBIASED SEARCH OF THE KOREAN LITERATURE FROM VARIOUS DATABASES WITHOUT ANY LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS, THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WILL BE USEFUL FOR BOTH PRACTITIONERS IN THE FIELD OF YOGA RESEARCH AS WELL AS FOR PATIENTS.	2016

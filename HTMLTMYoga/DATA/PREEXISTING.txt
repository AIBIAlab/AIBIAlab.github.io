1  529 123 COMPARISON OF PROTEIN-PACING ALONE OR WITH YOGA/STRETCHING AND RESISTANCE TRAINING ON GLYCEMIA, TOTAL AND REGIONAL BODY COMPOSITION, AND AEROBIC FITNESS IN OVERWEIGHT WOMEN. BACKGROUND: YOGA/STRETCHING (YS) AND FUNCTIONAL RESISTANCE (FR) TRAINING ARE POPULAR EXERCISE ROUTINES. A PROTEIN-PACING (PP) DIET IS A COMMON DIETARY REGIMEN. THUS, WE ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A PP DIET ALONE AND IN COMBINATION WITH EITHER YS OR FR TO IMPROVE BODY COMPOSITION AND CARDIOMETABOLIC HEALTH. METHODS: TWENTY-SEVEN OVERWEIGHT WOMEN (AGE = 43.2 +/- 4.6 YEARS) WERE RANDOMIZED INTO 3 GROUPS: YOGA (YS, N = 8) OR RESISTANCE (FR, N = 10) TRAINING (3 DAYS/WEEK) IN CONJUNCTION WITH PP DIET (50% CARBOHYDRATE, 25% PROTEIN, AND 25% FAT) OR PP DIET-ONLY (PP, N = 9) THROUGHOUT 12-WEEK STUDY. PP MAINTAINED PREEXISTING LEVELS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. BODY WEIGHT (BW), TOTAL (BF) AND ABDOMINAL (ABF) BODY FAT, WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE (WC), PLASMA BIOMARKERS, AND AEROBIC FITNESS (VO2) WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE AND 12 WEEKS. RESULTS: WC AND TOTAL CHOLESTEROL IMPROVED IN ALL GROUPS, WHEREAS GLYCEMIA TENDED TO IMPROVE (P = .06) IN S. BF, ABF, AND VO2 INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN YS AND FR (P < .05). FEELINGS OF VIGOR INCREASED IN YS AND TENSION DECREASED IN FR (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: YS TRAINING TENDED TO DECREASE BLOOD GLUCOSE COMPARED WITH FR AND PP AND IS EQUALLY EFFECTIVE AT ENHANCING BODY COMPOSITION, AND AEROBIC FITNESS IN OVERWEIGHT WOMEN PROVIDING A STRONG RATIONALE FOR FURTHER RESEARCH ON YS TRAINING.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
2 2076  30 THE EFFECT OF BIKRAM YOGA ON ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION IN YOUNG AND MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER ADULTS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS INVESTIGATION WAS TO DETERMINE IF BIKRAM YOGA, A STYLE OF HEATED HATHA YOGA, WOULD IMPROVE ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION IN YOUNG AND MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER, HEALTHY ADULTS. THIS TRIAL WAS PERFORMED IN 36 YOUNG (N = 17) AND MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER ADULTS (N = 19) WHO COMPLETED 3 WEEKLY BIKRAM YOGA CLASSES FOR 8 WEEKS. HEIGHT, BODY WEIGHT AND BODY COMPOSITION WERE DETERMINED AND ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION WAS MEASURED NONINVASIVELY USING BRACHIAL ARTERY FLOW-MEDIATED DILATION (FMD) BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION. NO CHANGES IN BODY WEIGHT, BMI OR BODY FAT PERCENTAGE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE INTERVENTION IN EITHER GROUP. BRACHIAL ARTERY FMD WAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER (P < 0.05) BUT NOT IN YOUNG ADULTS AS A RESULT OF THE INTERVENTION. THE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT A RELATIVELY SHORT-TERM BIKRAM YOGA PRACTICE MIGHT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION IN MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER ADULTS. WHILE APPARENTLY HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS IN THIS STUDY EXPERIENCED NO ADVERSE EVENTS, THOSE WITH PREEXISTING CONDITIONS SHOULD TAKE CAUTION AND CONSULT WITH A PHYSICIAN PRIOR TO ENGAGING IN THIS STYLE OF YOGA.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
3  100  17 A PERSPECTIVE ON YOGA AS A PREVENTIVE STRATEGY FOR CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019. THE PANDEMIC OUTBREAK OF CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) INFECTION CAUSED BY SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME-CORONAVIRUS 2 HAS LED TO PROFOUND PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS. IN PARTICULAR, INDIVIDUALS WITH PREEXISTING CONDITIONS OF HEART DISEASE, DIABETES, CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES AND THE ELDERLY ARE MOST VULNERABLE TO SUCCUMB TO THIS INFECTION. THE CURRENT COVID-19 EMERGENCY CALLS FOR RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF POTENTIAL PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AGAINST THIS VIRUS-MEDIATED DISEASE. THERE IS A PLETHORA OF EVIDENCE THAT SUPPORTS THE ADD-ON BENEFITS OF YOGA IN STRESS MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF CHRONIC NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES. THERE ARE SOME STUDIES ON THE EFFECT OF YOGA IN COMMUNICABLE DISEASES AS WELL BUT VERY FEW FOR ACUTE CONDITIONS AND ALMOST NONE FOR THE RAPIDLY SPREADING INFECTIONS RESULTING IN PANDEMICS. BASED ON THE AVAILABLE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCES ON YOGA IN IMPROVING RESPIRATORY AND IMMUNE FUNCTIONS, WE HAVE FORMULATED VERY SIMPLE DOABLE INTEGRATED YOGA MODULES IN THE FORM OF VIDEOS TO BE PRACTICED FOR PREVENTION OF THE DISEASE BY CHILDREN, ADULTS, AND THE ELDERLY.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
4 1045  34 EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS PRACTISED IN HEATED AND THERMONEUTRAL CONDITIONS ON ENDOTHELIUM-DEPENDENT VASODILATATION: THE BIKRAM YOGA HEART STUDY. NEW FINDINGS: WHAT IS THE CENTRAL QUESTION OF THIS STUDY? DOES THE HEATED PRACTICE ENVIRONMENT ENHANCE THE EFFECTS OF BIKRAM YOGA ON ENDOTHELIUM-DEPENDENT VASODILATATION IN HEALTHY, MIDDLE-AGED ADULTS? WHAT IS THE MAIN FINDING AND ITS IMPORTANCE? THE PRIMARY FINDING FROM THIS INVESTIGATION IS THAT THE HATHA YOGA POSTURES IN THE BIKRAM YOGA SERIES PRODUCE SIMILAR ENHANCEMENTS IN ENDOTHELIUM-DEPENDENT VASODILATATION IN HEALTHY, MIDDLE-AGED ADULTS REGARDLESS OF ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURE. THESE FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THE EFFICACY OF YOGA POSTURES IN PRODUCING IMPROVEMENTS IN VASCULAR HEALTH AND DOWNPLAY THE NECESSITY OF THE HEATED PRACTICE ENVIRONMENT IN INDUCING VASCULAR ADAPTATIONS. ABSTRACT: WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY DOCUMENTED IMPROVEMENTS IN ENDOTHELIUM-DEPENDENT VASODILATATION WITH A BIKRAM (HOT) YOGA INTERVENTION IN MIDDLE-AGED ADULTS. AT PRESENT, THE EFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURE IN HOT YOGA ON ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION IS UNKNOWN. THE PURPOSE OF THIS INVESTIGATION WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF BIKRAM YOGA INTERVENTIONS PERFORMED IN HEATED OR THERMONEUTRAL CONDITIONS ON ENDOTHELIUM-DEPENDENT VASODILATATION. FIFTY-TWO SEDENTARY BUT APPARENTLY HEALTHY ADULTS AGED 40-60 YEARS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THREE GROUPS: BIKRAM YOGA PRACTISED AT 40.5 DEGREES C (N = 19), BIKRAM YOGA PRACTISED AT 23 DEGREES C (N = 14) OR SEDENTARY TIME CONTROL (N = 19). THE YOGA INTERVENTIONS CONSISTED OF 90 MIN BIKRAM YOGA CLASSES THREE TIMES A WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS. ENDOTHELIUM-DEPENDENT VASODILATATION WAS MEASURED NON-INVASIVELY USING BRACHIAL ARTERY FLOW-MEDIATED DILATATION (FMD). BODY FAT PERCENTAGE DETERMINED VIA DUAL-ENERGY X-RAY ABSORPTIOMETRY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN THE HOT YOGA GROUP AFTER THE INTERVENTION THAN IN THE THERMONEUTRAL YOGA AND CONTROL CONDITIONS. BRACHIAL ARTERY FMD INCREASED (P < 0.05) IN THE THERMONEUTRAL YOGA GROUP AND TENDED TO INCREASE IN THE HOT YOGA GROUP (P = 0.056). NO CHANGES OCCURRED IN THE CONTROL GROUP. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN FMD CHANGE SCORES BETWEEN GROUPS. WE CONCLUDE THAT BIKRAM YOGA PRACTISED IN THERMONEUTRAL CONDITIONS IMPROVED ENDOTHELIUM-DEPENDENT VASODILATATION IN HEALTHY, MIDDLE-AGED ADULTS. THESE NEW FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF HATHA YOGA POSTURES ALONE, IN THE ABSENCE OF A HEATED PRACTICE ENVIRONMENT, IN IMPROVING VASCULAR HEALTH AND ARE OF CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE GIVEN THE INCREASED PROPENSITY FOR HEAT INTOLERANCE IN AGEING ADULTS.	2018

BRACHIAL-ANKLE PULSE WAVE VELOCITY (PWV) WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED BY HOT OR THERMONEUTRAL YOGA INTERVENTIONS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
6 1298  26 HATHA YOGA AND VASCULAR FUNCTION: RESULTS FROM CROSS-SECTIONAL AND INTERVENTIONAL STUDIES. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF HATHA YOGA ON ARTERIAL ELASTICITY AND ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION. FIRST, A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS PERFORMED TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOGA PRACTITIONERS WOULD DEMONSTRATE GREATER ARTERIAL COMPLIANCE AND ENDOTHELIUM-DEPENDENT VASODILATION THAN THEIR SEDENTARY PEERS. SECOND, AN INTERVENTION STUDY INVOLVING 13 SEDENTARY MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER ADULTS (51 +/- 7 YEARS) WAS PERFORMED TO DETERMINE WHETHER 12 WEEKS OF HATHA YOGA WOULD ELICIT INCREASES IN ARTERIAL COMPLIANCE AND ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION. IN THE CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY INVOLVING A TOTAL OF 34 SUBJECTS, THERE WERE NO GROUP DIFFERENCES IN BODY FATNESS, BLOOD LIPID AND LIPOPROTEIN CONCENTRATIONS, CAROTID ARTERY COMPLIANCE OR BRACHIAL ARTERY FLOW-MEDIATED DILATION (FMD). HEMOGLOBIN A1C WAS LOWER IN YOGA PRACTITIONERS THAN IN SEDENTARY ADULTS (P < 0.05). TOTAL CHOLESTEROL AND HEMOGLOBIN A1C DECREASED AFTER THE INTERVENTION (P < 0.05) WHILE CAROTID ARTERY COMPLIANCE AND BRACHIAL ARTERY FMD DID NOT CHANGE. THE RESULTS OF BOTH CROSS-SECTIONAL AND INTERVENTIONAL STUDIES INDICATE THAT REGULAR PRACTICE OF HATHA YOGA IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN VASCULAR FUNCTIONS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
7  268  34 ACUTE PHYSIOLOGIC EFFECTS OF PERFORMING YOGA IN THE HEAT ON ENERGY EXPENDITURE, RANGE OF MOTION, AND INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS. PERFORMING YOGA IN A HEATED ENVIRONMENT (HY) IS A POPULAR EXERCISE MODE PURPORTED TO IMPROVE RANGE OF MOTION (ROM), BODY COMPOSITION, AND AEROBIC FITNESS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS INVESTIGATION WAS TO COMPARE A SESSION OF HY TO ROOM TEMPERATURE YOGA (RTY) WITH REGARDS TO ROM, OXYGEN CONSUMPTION, CALORIC EXPENDITURE, AND BIOMARKERS OF ACUTE STRESS AND INFLAMMATION. SIXTEEN EXPERIENCED YOGA PRACTITIONERS (F14, M2; 40 +/- 11YR; 22.6 +/- 1.8 KG/M(2)) COMPLETED A 1-HOUR STANDARDIZED BIKRAM SEQUENCE IN HY (105 DEGREES F, 40 DEGREES C) AND RTY (74 DEGREES F, 23.3 DEGREES C) CONDITIONS (ORDER OF CONDITIONS RANDOMIZED, HUMIDITY STANDARDIZED AT 40%). INTRA-EXERCISE METABOLIC GAS EXCHANGE AND HEART RATE (HR) WAS MONITORED USING A METABOLIC CART. ROM MEASURES WERE TAKEN PRE AND POST-EXERCISE AT THE ELBOW, SHOULDER, HIP, AND KNEE. CYTOKINES INTERLEUKIN 6,10 (IL-6, IL-10) AND TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR ALPHA (TNF-ALPHA) WERE ANALYZED FROM BLOOD SAMPLES COLLECTED PRE- AND 30-MINUTES POST-EXERCISE. INTRA-EXERCISE METABOLIC GAS EXCHANGE AND HEART RATE (HR) WAS MONITORED USING A METABOLIC CART. BOTH BOUTS ELICITED SIMILAR ACUTE CHANGES IN ROM ALTHOUGH HY ELICITED A GREATER INCREASE IN HIP ABDUCTION (RTYDELTA DEGREES = 2.3 +/- 1.3|HYDELTA DEGREES = 6.6 +/- 1.5; P < 0.05). MEAN VO2, PEAK VO2, %VO2MAX, HR, AND KCAL EXPENDITURE DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN CONDITIONS. RER WAS LOWER DURING THE HY (RTY = 0.95 +/- 0.02| HY = 0.89 +/- 0.02; P < 0.05) WITH A CONCOMITANT ELEVATION IN FAT OXIDATION (RTY = 0.05 +/- 0.01|HY = 0.09 +/- 0.01, G.MIN(-1); P < 0.05) AND DECREASE IN CARBOHYDRATE OXIDATION (RTY = 0.51 +/- 0.04|HY = 0.44 +/- 0.03, G.MIN(-1); P < 0.05). SERUM IL-6 WAS INCREASED (15.5 +/- 8.0-FOLD) FOLLOWING HY ONLY (P < 0.05). HY DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY ELEVATE AEROBIC ENERGY COST COMPARED TO RTY BUT MAY ACUTELY INCREASE FAT SUBSTRATE UTILIZATION AND HIP ROM. FUTURE STUDIES REMAIN NEEDED TO ESTABLISH DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIPS FOR INCLUDING HY OR RTY INTO WELL-ROUNDED FITNESS PROGRAMS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
8  741  26 EFFECT OF REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE ON RESPIRATORY REGULATION AND EXERCISE PERFORMANCE. YOGA ALTERS SPONTANEOUS RESPIRATORY REGULATION AND REDUCES HYPOXIC AND HYPERCAPNIC VENTILATORY RESPONSES. SINCE A LOWER VENTILATORY RESPONSE IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN IMPROVED ENDURANCE CAPACITY DURING WHOLE-BODY EXERCISE, WE TESTED WHETHER YOGIC SUBJECTS (YOGA) SHOW AN INCREASED ENDURANCE CAPACITY COMPARED TO MATCHED NON-YOGIC INDIVIDUALS (CON) WITH SIMILAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY LEVELS. RESTING VENTILATION, THE VENTILATORY RESPONSE TO HYPERCAPNIA, PASSIVE LEG MOVEMENT AND EXERCISE, AS WELL AS ENDURANCE PERFORMANCE WERE ASSESSED. YOGA (N = 9), COMPARED TO CONTROL (N = 6), HAD A HIGHER TIDAL VOLUME AT REST (0.7+/-0.2 VS. 0.5+/-0.1 L, P = 0.034) AND A REDUCED VENTILATORY RESPONSE TO HYPERCAPNIA (33+/-15 VS. 47+/-15 L.MIN(-1), P = 0.048). A YOGA SUBGROUP (N = 6) WITH MAXIMAL PERFORMANCE SIMILAR TO CONTROL SHOWED A BLUNTED VENTILATORY RESPONSE TO PASSIVE CYCLING (11+/-2 VS. 14+/-2 L.MIN(-1), P = 0.039) AND A TENDENCY TOWARDS LOWER EXERCISE VENTILATION (33+/-2 VS. 36+/-3 L.MIN(-1), P = 0.094) WHILE CYCLING ENDURANCE (YOGA: 17.3+/-3.3; CON: 19.6+/-8.5 MIN, P = 0.276) DID NOT DIFFER. THUS, YOGA PRACTICE WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED EXERCISE CAPACITY NOR WITH SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN EXERCISE VENTILATION DESPITE A SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT RESPIRATORY REGULATION AT REST AND IN RESPONSE TO HYPERCAPNIA AND PASSIVE LEG MOVEMENT.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
9  276  40 ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENT OF RESPIRATORY TECHNIQUE ON VASCULAR FUNCTION IN HYPERTENSIVE POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN FOLLOWING YOGA OR STRETCHING VIDEO CLASSES: THE YOGINI STUDY. BACKGROUND: HYPERTENSION REMAINS HIGHLY PREVALENT IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN, ALONG WITH VASCULAR DYSFUNCTION AND INCREASED OXIDATIVE STRESS. IN SUCH CONTEXT, REGULAR EXERCISES, YOGA PRACTICE, AND SLOW BREATHING HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDED TO TREAT HYPERTENSION. HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS OF THE MULTIPLE COMPONENTS OF YOGA, INCLUDING THE RESPIRATORY TECHNIQUES INVOLVED IN THE PRACTICE, ON HYPERTENSION AND ON VASCULAR AND ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION HAVE NEVER BEEN EVALUATED. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE ADDITIONAL EFFECTS OF RESPIRATORY TECHNIQUE ON VASCULAR FUNCTION AND OXIDATIVE STRESS PROFILE IN HYPERTENSIVE POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN (HPMWS) FOLLOWING YOGA OR STRETCHING VIDEO CLASSES. STUDY DESIGN: HYPERTENSIVE POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN WERE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED FOR 12 WEEKS, TWICE A WEEK, OF SUPERVISED YOGA OR STRETCHING VIDEO CLASSES OF 75 MIN FOR 12 WEEKS ASSOCIATED OR NOT WITH RESPIRATORY TECHNIQUE. BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION MEASUREMENTS INCLUDED PULSE WAVE VELOCITY (PWV), FLOW-MEDIATED DILATION (FMD), AND OXIDATIVE STRESS PARAMETERS. HYPERTENSIVE POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN (59 +/- 0.7 YEARS) WHO ENDED THE PROTOCOL WERE DISTRIBUTED INTO THREE GROUPS: (1) CONTROL GROUP (YOGA OR STRETCHING, C, N = 14); (2) YOGA + RESPIRATORY TECHNIQUE (Y+, N = 10); (3) STRETCHING + RESPIRATORY TECHNIQUE (S+, N = 9). RESULTS: DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND FMD [BASELINE: C: 6.94 +/- 1.97%, Y+: 7.05 +/- 1.65%, AND S+: 3.54 +/- 2.01% VS. POST: C: 16.59 +/- 3.46% (P = 0.006), Y+: 13.72 +/- 2.81% (P = 0.005), AND S+: 11.79 +/- 0.99% (P = 0.0001)] HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN ALL GROUPS WHEN BASELINE AND POST-PRACTICE VALUES WERE COMPARED. HOWEVER, RESTING HEART RATE AND PWV [BASELINE: Y+: 10.44 +/- 3.69 AND S+: 9.50 +/- 0.53 M/S VS. POST: Y+: 9.45 +/- 0.39 (P = 0.003) AND S+: 8.02 +/- 0.47 M/S (P = 0.003)] DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY ONLY IN THE Y+ AND S+ GROUPS (BASELINE VS. POST). SYSTEMIC ANTIOXIDANT ENZYME ACTIVITIES (SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE AND CATALASE) INCREASED IN ALL GROUPS, AND HYDROGEN PEROXIDE AND LIPOPEROXIDATION REDUCED IN Y+ AND S+ (BASELINE VS. POST). CONCLUSIONS: TWELVE WEEKS OF YOGA OR STRETCHING VIDEO CLASSES PROMOTED POSITIVE CHANGES IN SEVERAL OUTCOMES GENERALLY REGARDED AS CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS IN HPMWS, AND THESE CHANGES WERE EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED BY THE ASSOCIATION WITH RESPIRATORY TECHNIQUE.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                       
10  437  35 CARDIOVASCULAR AND METABOLIC EFFECTS OF INTENSIVE HATHA YOGA TRAINING IN MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER WOMEN FROM NORTHERN MEXICO. BACKGROUND: HATHA YOGA (HY) CAN BE AN ALTERNATIVE TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER WOMEN. HOWEVER, CONVENTIONAL HY (CHY) EXERCISING MAY NOT RESULT IN ENOUGH TRAINING STIMULUS TO IMPROVE CARDIOVASCULAR FITNESS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF AN INTENSIVE HY INTERVENTION (IHY) ON CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS IN MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER WOMEN FROM NORTHERN MEXICO. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IN THIS PROSPECTIVE QUASIEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN, FOUR MIDDLE-AGED AND NINE OLDER CHY PRACTICING FEMALES (YOGINIS) WERE ENROLLED INTO AN 11-WEEK IHY PROGRAM CONSISTING OF 5 SESSIONS/WEEK FOR 90 MIN (55 SESSIONS). THE PROGRAM ADHERENCE, ASANA PERFORMANCE, AND WORK INTENSITY WERE ASSESSED ALONG THE INTERVENTION. ANTHROPOMETRIC [BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), % BODY FAT AND SIGMA SKIN FOLDS], CARDIOVASCULAR FITNESS [MAXIMAL EXPIRED AIR VOLUME (VE(MAX)), MAXIMAL O(2) CONSUMPTION (VO(2MAX)), MAXIMAL HEART RATE (HR(MAX)), SYSTOLIC (BPS) AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (BPD)], BIOCHEMICAL [GLUCOSE, TRIACYLGLYCEROLS (TAG), TOTAL CHOLESTEROL (TC), HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL (HDL-C), AND LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL (LDL-C)], AND DIETARY PARAMETERS WERE EVALUATED BEFORE AND AFTER IHY. RESULTS: DAILY CALORIC INTAKE (~1,916 KCAL/DAY), PROGRAM ADHERENCE (~85%), AND EXERCISING SKILLS (ASANA PERFORMANCE) WERE SIMILAR IN BOTH MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER WOMEN. THE IHY PROGRAM DID NOT MODIFY ANY ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS. HOWEVER, IT INCREASED VO(2MAX) AND VE(MAX) AND HDL-C WHILE TAG AND LDL-C REMAINED STABLE IN BOTH MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER GROUPS (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: THE PROPOSED IHY PROGRAM IMPROVES DIFFERENT CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS (NAMELY VO(2MAX) AND HDL-C) IN MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER WOMEN.	2009

12 1693  27 OXYGEN CONSUMPTION DURING VINIYOGA PRACTICE IN ADULTS. CONTEXT: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO MEASURE THE OXYGEN CONSUMPTION (VO2) DURING VINIYOGA YOGA MOVEMENTS (ASANAS) AND TO COMPARE VO2 WALKING AMONG ADULTS. METHODS: YOGA PRACTITIONERS (N = 10) WERE RECRUITED TO MEASURE VO2 WHILE AT REST (30 MIN), PRACTICING YOGA (16 MOVEMENTS WITH DIFFERENT VARIATIONS), AND TREADMILL WALKING AT 2 MPH (10 MIN) AND 3 MPH (10 MIN). VO2 WAS MEASURED USING A WHOLE-ROOM INDIRECT CALORIMETRY. EACH YOGA MOVEMENT WAS CATEGORIZED BY BODY ORIENTATION AS STANDING, LYING, AND SITTING. THE DIFFERENCES IN VO2 BETWEEN YOGA AND WALKING WERE EXAMINED USING PEARSON'S CORRELATIONS. DIFFERENCES IN VO2 BETWEEN POSES (STANDING, SITTING, AND LYING) WERE EXAMINED USING LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS. VO2. RESULTS: MEAN YOGA-VO2 FOR THE ENTIRE YOGA SESSION WAS 3.7 (STANDARD DEVIATION [SD] 0.43, RANGE: 4.4-8.9) ML/KG/MIN. YOGA-VO2 VARIED BY BODY ORIENTATION: STANDING = 7.5 (SD = 1.5) ML/KG/MIN, LYING = 5.3 (SD = 1.0) ML/KG/MIN, AND SITTING = 5.4 (SD = 1.1) ML/KG/MIN. AFTER ADJUSTING FOR BODY MASS, FREQUENCY OF YOGA PRACTICE, AND RESTING ENERGY EXPENDITURE, FEMALE GENDER WAS NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH MEAN YOGA VO2 FOR STANDING (B = -112.19, P < 0.05), LYING (B = -141.87, P < 0.05), AND SITTING (B = -129.96, P < 0.05). MEAN VO2 FOR WALKING 2 MPH WAS COMPARABLE WITH SITTING (R = 0.836, P < 0.05) AND LYING (R = 0.735, P < 0.05) WHEREAS WALKING AT 3 MPH WAS COMPARABLE WITH STANDING (R = 0.718, P < 0.05) AND SITTING (R = 0.760, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: WE CONCLUDE THAT VO2 DURING YOGA PRACTICE IS COMPARABLE TO VO2 DURING SLOW TREADMILL WALKING AND MAY VARY BASED ON GENDER AND BODY ORIENTATION.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
13  804  16 EFFECT OF YOGA ON AEROBIC AND ANAEROBIC POWER OF MUSCLES. AEROBIC POWER (VO2 MAX) AND ANAEROBIC POWER WERE ESTIMATED IN MEDICAL STUDENTS BEFORE AND AFTER SIX WEEKS OF YOGIC TRAINING. A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN AEROBIC POWER AND A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN ANAEROBIC POWER WAS OBSERVED. THIS MAY BE DUE TO CONVERSION OF SOME OF THE FAST TWITCH (F.T.) MUSCLE FIBRES INTO SLOW TWITCH FIBRES (S.T.) DURING YOGIC TRAINING.	1991	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
14  942  29 EFFECTS OF 8-WEEK HATHA YOGA TRAINING ON METABOLIC AND INFLAMMATORY MARKERS IN HEALTHY, FEMALE CHINESE SUBJECTS: A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. WE AIMED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF AN 8 WK HATHA YOGA TRAINING ON BLOOD GLUCOSE, INSULIN, LIPID PROFILES, ENDOTHELIAL MICROPARTICLES (EMPS), AND INFLAMMATORY STATUS IN HEALTHY, LEAN, AND FEMALE CHINESE SUBJECTS. A TOTAL OF 30 HEALTHY, FEMALE CHINESE SUBJECTS WERE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED INTO CONTROL OR YOGA PRACTICE GROUP. THE YOGA PRACTICE INCLUDED 8 WKS OF YOGA PRACTICE (2 TIMES/WK) FOR A TOTAL OF 16 TIMES. FASTING BLOOD SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA TRAINING. PLASMA WAS ISOLATED FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF LIPID PROFILES, GLUCOSE, INSULIN, EMPS, AND INFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES. WHOLE BLOOD WAS CULTURED EX VIVO AND STIMULATED WITH LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE (LPS) AND PAM3CYS-SK4. PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS (PBMCS) WERE ISOLATED FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF TLR2 AND TLR4 PROTEIN EXPRESSION. YOGA PRACTICE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED PLASMA CHOLESTEROL, LDL-CHOLESTEROL, INSULIN LEVELS, AND CD31+/CD42B- EMPS. CULTURED WHOLE BLOOD FROM THE YOGA GROUP HAS REDUCED PROINFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES SECRETION BOTH AT UNSTIMULATED CONDITION AND WHEN STIMULATED WITH PAM3CYS-SK4; THIS MIGHT BE ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED TLR2 PROTEIN EXPRESSION IN PBMCS AFTER YOGA TRAINING. HATHA YOGA PRACTICE IN HEALTHY CHINESE FEMALE SUBJECTS COULD IMPROVE HALLMARKS RELATED TO METS; THUS IT CAN BE CONSIDERED AS AN ANCILLARY INTERVENTION IN THE PRIMARY METS PREVENTION FOR THE HEALTHY POPULATION. THIS TRIAL IS REGISTERED WITH CHICTR-IOR-14005747.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
15 2778  21 YOGA STRETCHING FOR IMPROVING SALIVARY IMMUNE FUNCTION AND MENTAL STRESS IN MIDDLE-AGED AND OLDER ADULTS. PROTECTION AGAINST AGE-RELATED IMMUNE SUPPRESSION IS IMPORTANT IN ELDERLY INDIVIDUALS. THIS STUDY DETERMINED THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON MUCOSAL IMMUNE FUNCTION AND MENTAL STRESS. SALIVA SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED FROM 23 ADULT WOMEN (AGE: 60.4 +/- 10.4 YEARS) BEFORE AND AFTER 90 MINUTES OF YOGA STRETCHING OR REST TO MEASURE SECRETORY IMMUNOGLOBULIN A (SIGA), CORTISOL, AND TESTOSTERONE. THE SIGA CONCENTRATION AND SECRETION RATE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AFTER YOGA THAN BEFORE (P < .05). THE CORTISOL CONCENTRATION AND SECRETION RATE WERE LOWER AND TESTOSTERONE SECRETION RATE HIGHER AFTER YOGA (P < .05). YOGA STRETCHING CAN REDUCE STRESS AND ENHANCE MUCOSAL IMMUNE FUNCTION IN ELDERLY WOMEN.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
16   57  29 A COMPARISON OF BLOOD VISCOSITY AND HEMATOCRIT LEVELS BETWEEN YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND SEDENTARY ADULTS. ELEVATIONS IN WHOLE BLOOD VISCOSITY (WBV) AND HEMATOCRIT (HCT), HAVE BEEN LINKED WITH INCREASED RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (CVD). ENDURANCE TRAINING HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO LOWER WBV AND HCT; HOWEVER, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE EFFICACY OF YOGA ON THESE MEASURES IS SPARSE. A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED EXAMINING WBV AND HCT LEVELS BETWEEN YOGA PRACTITIONERS WITH A MINIMUM OF 3 YEARS OF CONSISTENT PRACTICE AND SEDENTARY, HEALTHY ADULTS. BLOOD SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED FROM A TOTAL OF 42 PARTICIPANTS: 23 SEDENTARY ADULTS AND 19 REGULAR YOGA PRACTITIONERS. BRACHIAL ARTERIAL BLOOD PRESSURE (BP) WAS MEASURED AND THE AVERAGES OF 3 MEASURES WERE REPORTED. THE YOGA PRACTITIONER GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER WBV AT 45 S(-1) (P < 0.01), 90 S(-1) (P < 0.01), 220 S(-1) (P < 0.05), AND 450 S(-1) (P < 0.05) THAN SEDENTARY PARTICIPANTS. NO SIGNIFICANT GROUP DIFFERENCES IN HCT (P =0.38) WERE FOUND. A TENDENCY TOWARD LOWER SYSTOLIC BP (P=0.06) WAS OBSERVED IN THE YOGA PRACTITIONER GROUP; HOWEVER, NO SIGNIFICANT GROUP DIFFERENCES IN BP WERE EXHIBITED. A CONSISTENT YOGA PRACTICE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER WBV, A HEALTH INDICATOR RELATED TO CVD RISK. THESE FINDINGS SUPPORT A REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE AS A VALID FORM OF EXERCISE FOR IMPROVING RHEOLOGICAL INDICATORS OF CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
17  404  31 BIKRAM YOGA TRAINING AND PHYSICAL FITNESS IN HEALTHY YOUNG ADULTS. THERE HAS BEEN RELATIVELY LITTLE LONGITUDINAL CONTROLLED INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON GENERAL PHYSICAL FITNESS, DESPITE THE WIDESPREAD PARTICIPATION IN THIS FORM OF EXERCISE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS EXPLORATORY STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF SHORT-TERM BIKRAM YOGA TRAINING ON GENERAL PHYSICAL FITNESS. YOUNG HEALTHY ADULTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA TRAINING (N = 10, 29 +/- 6 YEARS, 24 SESSIONS IN 8 WEEKS) OR A CONTROL GROUP (N = 11, 26 +/- 7 YEARS). EACH YOGA TRAINING SESSION CONSISTED OF 90-MINUTE STANDARDIZED SUPERVISED POSTURES PERFORMED IN A HEATED AND HUMIDIFIED STUDIO. ISOMETRIC DEADLIFT STRENGTH, HANDGRIP STRENGTH, LOWER BACK/HAMSTRING AND SHOULDER FLEXIBILITY, RESTING HEART RATE AND BLOOD PRESSURE, MAXIMAL OXYGEN CONSUMPTION (TREADMILL), AND LEAN AND FAT MASS (DUAL-ENERGY X-RAY ABSORPTIOMETRY) WERE MEASURED BEFORE AND AFTER TRAINING. YOGA SUBJECTS EXHIBITED INCREASED DEADLIFT STRENGTH, SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED LOWER BACK/HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY, INCREASED SHOULDER FLEXIBILITY, AND MODESTLY DECREASED BODY FAT COMPARED WITH CONTROL GROUP. THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN HANDGRIP STRENGTH, CARDIOVASCULAR MEASURES, OR MAXIMAL AEROBIC FITNESS. IN SUMMARY, THIS SHORT-TERM YOGA TRAINING PROTOCOL PRODUCED BENEFICIAL CHANGES IN MUSCULOSKELETAL FITNESS THAT WERE SPECIFIC TO THE TRAINING STIMULUS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
18  968  41 EFFECTS OF AN 8-MONTH ASHTANGA-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION ON BONE METABOLISM IN MIDDLE-AGED PREMENOPAUSAL WOMEN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. ALTHOUGH YOGA HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE AN ALTERNATIVE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO ENHANCE BONE HEALTH, THERE IS A LACK OF HIGH QUALITY EVIDENCE FOR THIS TYPE OF INTERVENTION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF A PROGRESSIVE 8-MONTH ASHTANGA-BASED YOGA PROGRAM ON BONE TURNOVER MARKERS (BTM), AREAL BONE MINERAL DENSITY (ABMD) AND VOLUMETRIC BONE CHARACTERISTICS IN PREMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. THIRTY-FOUR PREMENOPAUSAL WOMEN (35-50 YEARS) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED EITHER TO A YOGA GROUP (YE, N = 16) OR A CONTROL GROUP (CON, N = 18). PARTICIPANTS IN YE GROUP PERFORMED 60 MINUTES OF AN ASHTANGA-BASED YOGA SERIES 2 TIMES/WEEK WITH ONE DAY BETWEEN SESSIONS FOR 8 MONTHS, AND THE SESSION INTENSITY WAS PROGRESSIVELY INCREASED BY ADDING THE NUMBER OF SUN SALUTATIONS (SS). PARTICIPANTS IN CON WERE ENCOURAGED TO MAINTAIN THEIR NORMAL DAILY LIFESTYLES MONITORED BY THE BONE SPECIFIC PHYSICAL ACTIVITY QUESTIONNAIRE (BPAQ) AT 2 MONTH INTERVALS FOR 8 MONTHS. BODY COMPOSITION WAS MEASURED BY DUAL ENERGY X-RAY ABSORPTIOMETRY (DXA). BONE FORMATION (BONE ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE, BONE ALP) AND BONE RESORPTION (TARTRATE-RESISTANT ACID PHOSPHATASE-5B, TRAP5B) MARKERS WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND AFTER 8 MONTHS. ABMD OF TOTAL BODY, LUMBAR SPINE AND DUAL PROXIMAL FEMUR AND TIBIA BONE CHARACTERISTICS WERE MEASURED USING DXA AND PERIPHERAL QUANTITATIVE COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (PQCT), RESPECTIVELY. WE FOUND THAT THE SERUM BONE ALP CONCENTRATIONS WERE MAINTAINED IN YE, BUT SIGNIFICANTLY (P = 0.005) DECREASED IN CON AFTER THE 8 MONTH INTERVENTION, AND THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT (P = 0.002) GROUP DIFFERENCES IN BONE ALP PERCENT CHANGES (YE 9.1 +/- 4.0% VS. CON -7.1 +/- 2.3%). NO CHANGES IN TRAP5B WERE FOUND IN EITHER GROUP. THE 8-MONTH YOGA PROGRAM DID NOT INCREASE ABMD OR TIBIA BONE STRENGTH VARIABLES. BODY COMPOSITION RESULTS SHOWED NO CHANGES IN WEIGHT, FAT MASS, OR % FAT, BUT SMALL SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN BONE FREE LEAN BODY MASS OCCURRED IN BOTH GROUPS. THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT REGULAR LONG-TERM ASHTANGA YOGA HAD A SMALL POSITIVE EFFECT ON BONE FORMATION BUT DID NOT ALTER ABMD OR TIBIA BONE CHARACTERISTICS IN PREMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. KEY POINTSREGULAR LONG-TERM ASHTANGA-BASED YOGA PROGRAM HAD A SMALL POSITIVE EFFECT ON BONE FORMATION, BUT NO EFFECTS WERE FOUND ON BONE RESORPTION.NONE OF THE BONE DENSITY OR GEOMETRY VARIABLES WERE CHANGED BY THE 8-MONTH ASHTANGA-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION.FUTURE YOGA INTERVENTIONS SHOULD FOCUS ON LONGER DURATION AND GREATER FREQUENCY TO ELICIT IMPROVEMENTS IN BONE MINERAL DENSITY.	2015	

19 2252  25 THE METABOLIC COST OF HATHA YOGA. TO DETERMINE THE METABOLIC AND HEART RATE (HR) RESPONSES OF HATHA YOGA, 26 WOMEN (19-40 YEARS OLD) PERFORMED A 30-MINUTE HATHA YOGA ROUTINE OF SUPINE LYING, SITTING, AND STANDING ASANAS (I.E., POSTURES). SUBJECTS FOLLOWED IDENTICAL VIDEOTAPED SEQUENCES OF HATHA YOGA ASANAS. MEAN PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES WERE COMPARED TO THE PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES OF RESTING IN A CHAIR AND WALKING ON A TREADMILL AT 93.86 M.MIN(-1) [3.5 MILES PER HOUR (MPH)]. DURING THE 30-MINUTE HATHA YOGA ROUTINE, MEAN ABSOLUTE OXYGEN CONSUMPTION (VO(2)), RELATIVE VO(2), PERCENTAGE MAXIMAL OXYGEN CONSUMPTION (%VO(2)R), METABOLIC EQUIVALENTS (METS), ENERGY EXPENDITURE, HR, AND PERCENTAGE MAXIMAL HEART RATE (%MHR) WERE 0.45 L.MIN(-1), 7.59 ML.KG(-1).MIN(-1), 14.50%, 2.17 METS, 2.23 KCAL.MIN(-1), 105.29 B.MIN(-1), AND 56.89%, RESPECTIVELY. WHEN COMPARED TO RESTING IN A CHAIR, HATHA YOGA REQUIRED 114% GREATER O(2) (L.MIN(-1)), 111% GREATER O(2)(ML.KG(-1).MIN(-1)), 4,294% GREATER %VO(2)R, 111% GREATER METS, 108% GREATER KCAL.MIN(-1), 24% GREATER HR, AND 24% GREATER %MHR. WHEN COMPARED TO WALKING AT 93.86 M.MIN(-1), HATHA YOGA REQUIRED 54% LOWER O(2)(L.MIN(-1)), 53% LOWER O(2)(ML.KG(-1).MIN(-1)), 68% LOWER %VO(2)R, 53% LOWER METS, 53% LOWER KCAL.MIN(-1), 21% LOWER HR, AND 21% LOWER %MHR. THE HATHA YOGA ROUTINE IN THIS STUDY REQUIRED 14.50% VO(2)R, WHICH CAN BE CONSIDERED A VERY LIGHT INTENSITY AND SIGNIFICANTLY LIGHTER THAN 44.8% VO(2)R FOR WALKING AT 93.86 M.MIN(-1) (3.5 MPH). THE INTENSITY OF HATHA YOGA MAY BE TOO LOW TO PROVIDE A TRAINING STIMULUS FOR IMPROVING CARDIOVASCULAR FITNESS. ALTHOUGH PREVIOUS RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT HATHA YOGA IS AN ACCEPTABLE FORM OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOR ENHANCING MUSCULAR FITNESS AND FLEXIBILITY, THESE DATA DEMONSTRATE THAT HATHA YOGA MAY HAVE LITTLE, IF ANY, CARDIOVASCULAR BENEFIT.	2005	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
20  449  19 CHANGES IN CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS AND HORMONES DURING A COMPREHENSIVE RESIDENTIAL THREE MONTH KRIYA YOGA TRAINING AND VEGETARIAN NUTRITION. IN PARTICIPANTS OF A COMPREHENSIVE RESIDENTIAL THREE MONTH YOGA AND MEDIATION TRAINING PROGRAMME LIVING ON A LOW FAT LACTO-VEGETARIAN DIET CHANGES IN CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS AND HORMONES WERE STUDIED. SUBSTANTIAL RISK FACTOR REDUCTION WAS FOUND. BODY MASS INDEX, TOTAL SERUM AND LDL CHOLESTEROL, FIBRINOGEN, AND BLOOD PRESSURE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED ESPECIALLY IN THOSE WITH ELEVATED LEVELS. URINARY EXCRETION OF ADRENALINE, NORADRENALINE, DOPAMINE, ALDOSTERONE, AS WELL AS SERUM TESTOSTERONE AND LUTEINIZING HORMONE LEVELS WERE REDUCED, WHILE CORTISOL EXCRETION INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY.	1997

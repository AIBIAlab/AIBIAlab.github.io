1 1445 147 INCREASING TREND OF YOGA PRACTICE AMONG U.S. ADULTS FROM 2002 TO 2017. INTRODUCTION: BENEFITS, RISKS, AND THE INCREASING POPULARITY OF YOGA USE WARRANT ASSESSING YOGA PRACTICE PREVALENCE AND USERS' PROFILES. THIS STUDY DESCRIBES TRENDS IN YOGA PRACTICE EXCLUSIVELY AMONG AMERICAN ADULTS FROM 2002 TO 2017, COMPARES THE PROFILE OF YOGA USERS, AND IDENTIFIES FACTORS RELATED TO YOGA USE OVER TIME. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS STUDY IS A SECONDARY ANALYSIS DONE IN 2019 AND 2020 USING THE NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY (NHIS) 2002, 2007, 2012, AND 2017 DATA. POPULATION WEIGHTS WERE USED TO OBTAIN STATISTICALLY ACCURATE ESTIMATES OF YOGA USE PREVALENCE FOR THE U.S. POPULATION. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS WERE USED TO PROFILE THE SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND HEALTH-RELATED CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA USERS. MULTIVARIABLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION WAS USED TO IDENTIFY FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA USE IN EACH COHORT DEFINED BY THE NHIS YEAR. RESULTS: YOGA PRACTICE PREVALENCE NEARLY TRIPLED FROM 5.1% IN 2002 TO 13.7% IN 2017 (WEIGHTED ESTIMATE 10,386,456 AND 32,761,194 AMERICAN ADULTS, RESPECTIVELY). TYPICAL YOGA USERS WERE YOUNG NON-HISPANIC SINGLE WHITE FEMALE ADULTS WITH BACHELOR OR HIGHER EDUCATION AND HEALTH INSURANCE, AND RESIDED IN THE WEST REGION OF THE UNITED STATES. YOGA USE PATTERN CHANGE OVER TIME WAS SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO ONLY YOUNGER AGE (P < 0.001) BUT NOT TO OTHER SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC OR HEALTH-RELATED FACTORS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA HAS GAINED INCREASING POPULARITY IN THE PAST TWO DECADES AMONG AMERICAN ADULTS, WITH YOUNGER ADULTS BEING THE DRIVING FORCE. YOGA APPEARS TO BE ADOPTED FOR GENERAL WELL-BEING OR PREVENTION MORE THAN FOR SPECIFIC DISEASE TREATMENT. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD EVALUATE HOW YOGA CAN BE EFFECTIVELY AND SAFELY INTEGRATED INTO PREVENTIVE MEDICINE STRATEGIES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
2  473  51 CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA USERS: RESULTS OF A NATIONAL SURVEY. BACKGROUND: THERE ARE LIMITED DATA ON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA USERS IN THE U.S. OBJECTIVE: TO CHARACTERIZE YOGA USERS, MEDICAL REASONS FOR USE, PERCEPTIONS OF HELPFULNESS, AND DISCLOSURE OF USE TO MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS. METHODS: UTILIZING CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY DATA FROM THE 2002 NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY (NHIS) ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE SUPPLEMENT (N = 31044), WE EXAMINED CORRELATES OF YOGA USE FOR HEALTH. THE ESTIMATED PREVALENCE FROM 2002 NHIS OF YOGA FOR HEALTH WAS 5.1% CORRESPONDING TO OVER 10 MILLION ADULTS. RESULTS: IN 2002, YOGA USERS WERE PREDOMINATELY CAUCASIAN (85%) AND FEMALE (76%) WITH A MEAN AGE OF 39.5 YEARS. COMPARED TO NON-YOGA USERS, YOGA USERS WERE MORE LIKELY FEMALE (OR 3.76, 95% CI 3.11-4.33); LESS LIKELY BLACK THAN WHITE (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.53-0.80); TENDED TO BE YOUNGER; AND MORE LIKELY COLLEGE EDUCATED (OR 2.70, 95% CI 2.37-3.08). MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.42-1.83), MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.22-1.67), SEVERE SPRAINS IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.22-1.81), AND ASTHMA (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05-1.54) WERE INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER YOGA USE, WHILE HYPERTENSION (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.64-0.95) AND CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.48-1.00) WERE ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER USE. YOGA WAS MOST COMMONLY USED TO TREAT MUSCULOSKELETAL OR MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS, AND MOST USERS REPORTED YOGA TO BE HELPFUL FOR THESE CONDITIONS. A MAJORITY OF YOGA USERS (61%) FELT YOGA WAS IMPORTANT IN MAINTAINING HEALTH, THOUGH ONLY 25% DISCLOSED YOGA PRACTICE TO THEIR MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL. CONCLUSIONS: WE FOUND THAT YOGA USERS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE WHITE, FEMALE, YOUNG AND COLLEGE EDUCATED. YOGA USERS REPORT BENEFIT FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS AND MENTAL HEALTH, INDICATING THAT FURTHER RESEARCH ON THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT AND/OR PREVENTION OF THESE CONDITIONS IS WARRANTED.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
3  628  39 DIFFERENCES BETWEEN VEGETARIAN AND OMNIVOROUS YOGA PRACTITIONERS-RESULTS OF A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SURVEY OF US ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS. BACKGROUND: TO EXAMINE THE PREVALENCE OF VEGETARIANISM AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS, AND TO EXPLORE DIFFERENCES AND SIMILARITIES BETWEEN YOGA PRACTITIONERS WHO ALSO USE VEGETARIAN DIET AND THOSE WHO DO NOT. DESIGN AND SETTING: USING CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA FROM THE 2012 NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY (NHIS) (N = 34,525), WEIGHTED FREQUENCIES FOR 12-MONTH PREVALENCE OF VEGETARIAN DIET USE AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS WERE ANALYZED. LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSES WERE USED TO ANALYZE SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL PREDICTORS OF VEGETARIAN DIET USE. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 1.7 MILLION US YOGA PRACTITIONERS HAVE USED A VEGETARIAN DIET IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS (8.3%), COMPARED TO 2.7 MILLION NON-YOGA PRACTITIONERS (1.3%). YOGA PRACTITIONERS WHO WERE AGED BETWEEN 30 AND 64 YEARS AS COMPARED TO BEING 29 YEARS OR YOUNGER WERE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE USED A VEGETARIAN DIET IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS; WHILE THOSE BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP (OR = 0.64), OVERWEIGHT (OR = 0.54), SMOKING (OR 0.64) OR HAVING PRIVATE HEALTH INSURANCE (OR = 0.59) WERE LESS LIKELY. VEGETARIAN DIET PRACTITIONERS MORE OFTEN INCLUDED MEDITATION AS PART OF THEIR YOGA PRACTICE AND MORE OFTEN CHOSE YOGA BECAUSE IT HAD A HOLISTIC FOCUS, AND WAS PERCEIVED TO TREAT THE CAUSE AND NOT THE SYMPTOMS OF THEIR HEALTH COMPLAINT. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA PRACTITIONERS FOLLOWING A VEGETARIAN DIET SEEM TO EMBRACE YOGA MORE AS A LIFESTYLE THAN AS A THERAPY.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
4 1785  51 PREDICTORS OF YOGA USE AMONG INTERNAL MEDICINE PATIENTS. BACKGROUND: YOGA SEEMS TO BE AN EFFECTIVE MEANS TO COPE WITH A VARIETY OF INTERNAL MEDICINE CONDITIONS. WHILE CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA USERS HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED IN THE GENERAL POPULATION, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT PREDICTORS OF YOGA USE AND BARRIERS TO YOGA USE IN INTERNAL MEDICINE PATIENTS. THE AIM OF THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYSIS WAS TO IDENTIFY SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC, CLINICAL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PREDICTORS OF YOGA USE AMONG INTERNAL MEDICINE PATIENTS. METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED AMONG ALL PATIENTS BEING REFERRED TO A DEPARTMENT OF INTERNAL AND INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE DURING A 3-YEAR PERIOD. IT WAS ASSESSED WHETHER PATIENTS HAD EVER USED YOGA FOR THEIR PRIMARY MEDICAL COMPLAINT, THE PERCEIVED BENEFIT, AND THE PERCEIVED HARM OF YOGA PRACTICE. POTENTIAL PREDICTORS OF YOGA USE INCLUDING SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, HEALTH BEHAVIOR, INTERNAL MEDICINE DIAGNOSIS, GENERAL HEALTH STATUS, MENTAL HEALTH, SATISFACTION WITH HEALTH, AND HEALTH LOCUS OF CONTROL WERE ASSESSED; AND ASSOCIATIONS WITH YOGA USE WERE TESTED USING MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS. ODDS RATIOS (OR) WITH 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CI) WERE CALCULATED FOR SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS. RESULTS: OF 2486 PARTICIPANTS, 303 (12.19%) REPORTED HAVING USED YOGA FOR THEIR PRIMARY MEDICAL COMPLAINT. OF THOSE, 184 (60.73%) REPORTED BENEFITS AND 12 (3.96%) REPORTED HARMS DUE TO YOGA PRACTICE. COMPARED TO YOGA NON-USERS, YOGA USERS WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE 50-64 YEARS OLD (OR = 1.45; 95%CI = 1.05-2.01; P = 0.025); FEMALE (OR = 2.45; 95%CI = 1.45-4.02; P < 0.001); AND COLLEGE GRADUATES (OR = 1.61; 95%CI = 1.14-2.27; P = 0.007); AND LESS LIKELY TO CURRENTLY SMOKE (OR = 0.61; 95%CI = 0.39-0.96; P = 0.031). MANIFEST ANXIETY (OR = 1.47; 95%CI = 1.06-2.04; P = 0.020); AND HIGH INTERNAL HEALTH LOCUS OF CONTROL (OR = 1.92; 95%CI = 1.38-2.67; P < 0.001) WERE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA USE, WHILE HIGH EXTERNAL-FATALISTIC HEALTH LOCUS OF CONTROL (OR = 0.66; 95%CI = 0.47-0.92; P = 0.014) WAS NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA USE. CONCLUSION: YOGA WAS USED FOR THEIR PRIMARY MEDICAL COMPLAINT BY 12.19% OF AN INTERNAL INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE PATIENT POPULATION AND WAS COMMONLY PERCEIVED AS BENEFICIAL. YOGA USE WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH THE PATIENTS' SPECIFIC DIAGNOSIS BUT WITH SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS, MENTAL HEALTH, AND HEALTH LOCUS OF CONTROL. TO IMPROVE ADHERENCE TO YOGA PRACTICE, IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED THAT MALE, YOUNGER, AND ANXIOUS PATIENTS AND THOSE WITH LOW INTERNAL HEALTH LOCUS OF CONTROL MIGHT BE LESS INTRINSICALLY MOTIVATED TO START YOGA.	2013	
                                                                           
5 1807  56 PREVALENCE, PATTERNS, AND PREDICTORS OF YOGA USE: RESULTS OF A U.S. NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SURVEY. INTRODUCTION: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE PREVALENCE, PATTERNS, AND PREDICTORS OF YOGA USE IN THE U.S. GENERAL POPULATION. METHODS: USING CROSS-SECTIONAL DATA FROM THE 2012 NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY FAMILY CORE, SAMPLE ADULT CORE, AND ADULT COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE QUESTIONNAIRES (N=34,525), WEIGHTED FREQUENCIES FOR LIFETIME AND 12-MONTH PREVALENCE OF YOGA USE AND PATTERNS OF YOGA PRACTICE WERE ANALYZED. USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSES, SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC PREDICTORS OF LIFETIME YOGA USE WERE ANALYZED. ANALYSES WERE CONDUCTED IN 2015. RESULTS: LIFETIME AND 12-MONTH PREVALENCE OF YOGA USE WERE 13.2% AND 8.9%, RESPECTIVELY. COMPARED WITH NONPRACTITIONERS, LIFETIME YOGA PRACTITIONERS WERE MORE LIKELY FEMALE, YOUNGER, NON-HISPANIC WHITE, COLLEGE EDUCATED, HIGHER EARNERS, LIVING IN THE WEST, AND OF BETTER HEALTH STATUS. AMONG THOSE WHO HAD PRACTICED IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS, 51.2% ATTENDED YOGA CLASSES, 89.9% USED BREATHING EXERCISES, AND 54.9% USED MEDITATION. YOGA WAS PRACTICED FOR GENERAL WELLNESS OR DISEASE PREVENTION (78.4%), TO IMPROVE ENERGY (66.1%), OR TO IMPROVE IMMUNE FUNCTION (49.7%). BACK PAIN (19.7%), STRESS (6.4%), AND ARTHRITIS (6.4%) WERE THE MAIN SPECIFIC HEALTH PROBLEMS FOR WHICH PEOPLE PRACTICED YOGA. CONCLUSIONS: ABOUT 31 MILLION U.S. ADULTS HAVE EVER USED YOGA, AND ABOUT 21 MILLION PRACTICED YOGA IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS. DISEASE PREVENTION AND BACK PAIN RELIEF WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT HEALTH REASONS FOR YOGA PRACTICE. YOGA PRACTICE IS ASSOCIATED WITH AGE, GENDER, ETHNICITY, SES, AND HEALTH STATUS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
6  291  42 ADVERSE EFFECTS OF YOGA: A NATIONAL CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY. BACKGROUND: WHILE YOGA IS INCREASINGLY USED FOR HEALTH PURPOSES, ITS SAFETY HAS BEEN QUESTIONED. THE AIM OF THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY WAS TO ANALYZE YOGA-ASSOCIATED ADVERSE EFFECTS AND THEIR CORRELATES. METHODS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL ANONYMOUS NATIONAL ONLINE SURVEY AMONG GERMAN YOGA PRACTITIONERS (N = 1702; 88.9% FEMALE; 47.2 +/- 10.8 YEARS) WAS CONDUCTED FROM JANUARY TO JUNE 2016. PARTICIPANTS WERE QUERIED REGARDING THEIR YOGA PRACTICE, I.E. YOGA STYLES USED, LENGTH AND INTENSITY OF YOGA PRACTICE, PRACTICE PATTERNS, AND WHETHER THEY HAD EXPERIENCED ACUTE OR CHRONIC ADVERSE EFFECTS OF THEIR YOGA PRACTICE. INDEPENDENT PREDICTORS OF ACUTE OR CHRONIC ADVERSE EFFECTS WERE IDENTIFIED USING MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSES. RESULTS: ASHTANGA YOGA (15.7%), TRADITIONAL HATHA YOGA (14.2%), AND SIVANANDA YOGA (22.4%) WERE THE MOST COMMONLY USED YOGA STYLES. 364 (21.4%) YOGA USERS REPORTED 702 ACUTE ADVERSE EFFECTS, OCCURRING AFTER A MEAN OF 7.6 +/- 8.0 YEARS OF YOGA PRACTICE. THE MOST COMMONLY REPORTED YOGA PRACTICES THAT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH ACUTE ADVERSE EFFECTS WERE HAND-, SHOULDER- AND HEAD STANDS (29.4%). USING VINIYOGA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A DECREASED RISK OF ACUTE ADVERSE EFFECTS; PRACTICING ONLY BY SELF-STUDY WITHOUT SUPERVISION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER RISK. ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY-THREE PARTICIPANTS (10.2%) REPORTED 239 CHRONIC ADVERSE EFFECTS. THE RISK OF CHRONIC ADVERSE EFFECTS WAS HIGHER IN PARTICIPANTS WITH CHRONIC ILLNESSES AND THOSE PRACTICING ONLY BY SELF-STUDY WITHOUT SUPERVISION. MOST REPORTED ADVERSE EFFECTS CONCERNED THE MUSCULOSKELETAL SYSTEM. 76.9% OF ACUTE CASES, AND 51.6% OF CHRONIC CASES REACHED FULL RECOVERY. ON AVERAGE 0.60 INJURIES (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL = 0.51-0.71) PER 1000 H OF PRACTICE WERE REPORTED, WITH POWER YOGA USERS REPORTING THE HIGHEST RATE (1.50 INJURIES PER 1000 H; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL = 0.98-3.15). CONCLUSIONS: ONE IN FIVE ADULT YOGA USERS REPORTED AT LEAST ONE ACUTE ADVERSE EFFECT IN THEIR YOGA PRACTICE, AND ONE IN TEN REPORTED AT LEAST ONE CHRONIC ADVERSE EFFECT, MAINLY MUSCULOSKELETAL EFFECTS. ADVERSE EFFECTS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HAND-, SHOULDER- AND HEAD STANDS; AND WITH YOGA SELF-STUDY WITHOUT SUPERVISION. MORE THAN THREE QUARTERS OF OF CASES REACHED FULL RECOVERY. BASED ON THE OVERALL INJURY RATE PER 1000 PRACTICE HOURS, YOGA APPEARS TO BE AS SAFE OR SAFER WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER EXERCISE TYPES.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
7 2928  37 [YOGA IN GERMANY - RESULTS OF A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SURVEY]. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS INCREASINGLY USED AS A THERAPEUTIC AND PREVENTIVE METHOD WORLDWIDE. THE AIM OF THIS NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SURVEY WAS TO ASSESS PREVALENCE AND PATTERNS OF YOGA PRACTICE IN GERMANY. METHODS: BETWEEN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER 2014, A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF 2,041 INDIVIDUALS OF AT LEAST 14 YEARS OF AGE WAS INTERVIEWED REGARDING ACTUAL AND PRIOR YOGA PRACTICE. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SOCIOECONOMIC SUBGROUPS WERE ANALYZED USING CHI-SQUARED TESTS. RESULTS: LIFETIME PREVALENCE OF YOGA PRACTICE WAS 15.1%, POINT PREVALENCE 3.3%. HIGHER PREVALENCE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH FEMALE GENDER (P < 0.001), HIGHER EDUCATION (P < 0.001), EMPLOYMENT (P = 0.047), AND LIVING IN A MAJOR CITY (P < 0.001). MEAN DURATION OF YOGA PRACTICE WAS 48.2 MONTHS; 61.7% PRACTICED AT LEAST ONCE WEEKLY. THE MAIN REASONS FOR YOGA PRACTICE WERE IMPROVED PHYSICAL (62.8%) AND MENTAL WELL-BEING (56.9%) AS WELL AS PHYSICAL (54.4%) AND MENTAL CAPACITY (50.0%). POSITIVE CHANGES DUE TO YOGA WERE REPORTED BY 89.7% OF PRACTITIONERS, MAINLY INCREASED INNER BALANCE (58.8%). ANOTHER 16.1% OF THOSE WHO WERE NOT CURRENTLY PRACTICING COULD IMAGINE PRACTICING YOGA IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. CONCLUSION: AN ESTIMATED 15.7 MILLION GERMANS ARE CURRENTLY PRACTICING YOGA OR ARE AT LEAST INTERESTED IN STARTING TO PRACTICE, MOST COMMONLY WOMEN, METROPOLITANS, AND THOSE WITH A HIGHER EDUCATION AS WELL AS EMPLOYED PERSONS. ALMOST 90% PRACTITIONERS REPORT POSITIVE CHANGES DUE TO THEIR YOGA PRACTICE.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
8 2335  41 UNDERSTANDING INTEREST, BARRIERS, AND PREFERENCES RELATED TO YOGA PRACTICE AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS. PURPOSE: DESPITE GROWING EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR CANCER-RELATED SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT, YOGA USAGE AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS IS LOW. TO TRANSLATE THE EVIDENCE OF YOGA BENEFITS INTO COMMUNITY PRACTICE, IT IS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTAND INTEREST IN YOGA AS WELL AS BARRIERS AND PREFERENCES THAT INFLUENCE YOGA USAGE AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS. METHOD: WE CONDUCTED A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY STUDY AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS, 18 YEARS OR OLDER, WITH A PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS OF CANCER, AND RECEIVING TREATMENT OR FOLLOW-UP CARE AT OUTPATIENT CLINICS AT FIVE REGIONAL ACADEMIC CANCER CENTER SITES. WE COLLECTED DATA AND PERFORMED BIVARIATE AND MULTIVARIABLE ANALYSES ON SELF-REPORTED YOGA USAGE AND INTEREST IN AND BARRIERS TO PRACTICING YOGA, AS WELL AS PREFERRED LOCATION AND TIME FOR YOGA PRACTICE. RESULTS: OF 857 PARTICIPANTS, 70.0% HAD NEVER PRACTICED YOGA AND 52.3% WERE INTERESTED IN PRACTICING YOGA. AMONG THOSE INTERESTED, 52.5% HAD NEVER PRACTICED YOGA. LOWER INTEREST WAS INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH BEING MALE (ODDS RATIO [OR] = 0.30, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI] = 0.20-0.44, P < 0.001), UNEMPLOYED (OR = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.39-0.91, P = 0.016), AND WHITE (OR = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.23-0.78, P = 0.005). COMMONLY CITED BARRIERS AMONG THOSE WHO WERE INTERESTED BUT HAD NEVER PRACTICED WERE NOT AWARE OF YOGA BENEFITS (36.3%), DIFFICULTY MOTIVATING (28.7%), EXPERIENCING SYMPTOMS (22.9%), AND NOT ENOUGH TIME (22.0%). PARTICIPANTS INDICATED "ON-SITE AND AT A STUDIO NEAR HOME" (41.5%) AS PREFERRED LOCATION AND EVENINGS (3-8 PM, 34.0%) AS PREFERRED TIME FOR YOGA PRACTICE. CONCLUSION: ALTHOUGH MORE THAN 50% OF PATIENTS INDICATED INTEREST IN PRACTICING YOGA, USE OF YOGA IS LOW AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS. BARRIERS AND PATIENT PREFERENCES FOR YOGA PRACTICE NEED TO BE ADDRESSED TO DESIGN EFFECTIVE YOGA PROGRAMS FOR THIS POPULATION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
9 1787  41 PREFERENCE AND EXPECTATION FOR TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF ONCE- VS TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. BACKGROUND: IN STUDIES INVOLVING NONPHARMACOLOGICAL COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE INTERVENTIONS, PARTICIPANT BLINDING IS VERY DIFFICULT. PARTICIPANT EXPECTATIONS MAY AFFECT PERCEIVED BENEFIT OF THERAPY. IN STUDIES OF YOGA AS TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PATIENT EXPECTATIONS AND PREFERENCES ON OUTCOMES. THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO IDENTIFY BASELINE PREDICTORS OF PREFERENCE AND TO DETERMINE IF EXPECTATIONS AND PREFERENCES FOR DIFFERENT DOSES OF YOGA AFFECT BACK-RELATED FUNCTION AND LOW BACK PAIN INTENSITY. METHODS: THIS WAS A SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS OF A 12-WEEK RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING ONCE-WEEKLY VS TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA FOR TREATMENT OF CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN IN 93 ADULTS FROM A PREDOMINANTLY LOW-INCOME MINORITY POPULATION. AT BASELINE, PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED ABOUT BACK FUNCTION, BACK PAIN, TREATMENT EXPECTATIONS, AND TREATMENT PREFERENCES. WE CREATED A VARIABLE "CONCORDANCE" TO DESCRIBE THE MATCHING OF PARTICIPANT PREFERENCE TO RANDOMIZED TREATMENT. OUR OUTCOME VARIABLES WERE CHANGE IN BACK FUNCTION AND PAIN INTENSITY AFTER 12 WEEKS OF YOGA INSTRUCTION. WE PERFORMED LOGISTIC REGRESSION TO IDENTIFY PREDICTORS OF PREFERENCE FOR ONCE- OR TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA INSTRUCTION. WE CREATED LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS TO IDENTIFY INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN EXPECTATIONS, PREFERENCE, CONCORDANCE, AND OUTCOMES. RESULTS: WORSE BACK FUNCTION AT BASELINE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH 20% HIGHER ODDS OF PREFERRING TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA (OR 1.2, CI 1.1, 1.3). INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGHER EXPECTATION SCORES FOR TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA HAD 90% HIGHER ODDS OF PREFERRING TWICE-WEEKLY VS ONCE-WEEKLY YOGA (OR 1.9, CI 1.3, 2.7). INDIVIDUALS WITH HIGHER EXPECTATION SCORES FOR ONCE-WEEKLY YOGA HAD 40% LESS ODDS OF PREFERRING TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA (OR 0.6, CI 0.5, 0.9). AFTER CONTROLLING FOR BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS, WE FOUND NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TREATMENT OUTCOMES, PREFERENCE, EXPECTATION SCORES, OR CONCORDANCE. CONCLUSION: IN A POPULATION OF PREDOMINANTLY LOW-INCOME MINORITY PARTICIPANTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN, WORSE BACK FUNCTION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH PREFERENCE FOR MORE FREQUENT YOGA CLASSES. THOSE WHO PREFERRED MORE YOGA CLASSES HAD HIGHER EXPECTATIONS FOR THOSE CLASSES. TWELVE-WEEK CHANGE IN BACK PAIN INTENSITY AND BACK FUNCTION WERE NOT AFFECTED BY DOSING PREFERENCE, EXPECTATION SCORE, OR CONCORDANCE. MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO BETTER MEASURE AND QUANTIFY PREFERENCE, EXPECTATIONS, AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO OUTCOMES IN YOGA RESEARCH.	2015	

10 1801  45 PREVALENCE AND PATTERNS OF ADULT YOGA USE IN THE UNITED STATES: RESULTS OF A NATIONAL SURVEY. BACKGROUND: ALTHOUGH YOGA APPEARS TO BE POPULAR IN THE UNITED STATES, THERE ARE NO PUBLISHED STUDIES ON YOGA'S PREVALENCE OR PATTERNS OF USE. METHODS: IN 1998 WE SURVEYED BY TELEPHONE A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF 2055 ENGLISH-SPEAKING U.S. ADULTS (60% WEIGHTED RESPONSE RATE) REGARDING YOGA USE. RESULTS: OF THE RESPONDENTS, 7.5% USED YOGA AT LEAST ONCE IN THEIR LIFETIME AND 3.8% USED YOGA IN THE PREVIOUS 12 MONTHS. RESPONDENTS WHO USED YOGA AT LEAST ONCE WERE MORE LIKELY THAN NON-USERS TO BE FEMALE (68% VS. 51%), COLLEGE EDUCATED (68% VS. 45%), AND URBAN DWELLERS (93% VS. 74%). FACTORS INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA USE AT LEAST ONCE INCLUDED FEMALE GENDER (OR 2.5 [95% CI 1.7-3.8]), BABY BOOMER AGE GROUP (AGES 34-53) COMPARED TO PRE-BABY BOOMERS (> OR = 54 (2.3 [1.4-4.0]), EDUCATION BEYOND HIGH SCHOOL (2.2 [1.4-3.5]), RESIDING IN LARGE AND SMALL METROPOLITAN AREAS COMPARED TO NON-METROPOLITAN AREAS (3.8 [1.8-7.8] AND 2.7 [1.3-5.8], RESPECTIVELY), AND USE OF OTHER CAM THERAPIES (5.3 [2.7-10.5]). OF RESPONDENTS USING YOGA IN THE PREVIOUS 12 MONTHS, 64% REPORTED USING YOGA FOR WELLNESS, 48% FOR HEALTH CONDITIONS, AND 21% SPECIFICALLY FOR BACK OR NECK PAIN. NINETY PERCENT FELT YOGA WAS VERY OR SOMEWHAT HELPFUL AND 76% DID NOT REPORT SPENDING MONEY RELATED TO THEIR YOGA. CONCLUSIONS: IN 1998 AN ESTIMATED 15.0 MILLION AMERICAN ADULTS HAD USED YOGA AT LEAST ONCE IN THEIR LIFETIME AND 7.4 MILLION DURING THE PREVIOUS YEAR. YOGA WAS USED FOR BOTH WELLNESS AND SPECIFIC HEALTH CONDITIONS OFTEN WITH PERCEIVED HELPFULNESS AND WITHOUT EXPENDITURE.	2004	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
11  357  39 ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLE PRACTICES AMONG WORKING ADULTS: A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY FROM SINGAPORE. OBJECTIVES: THERE IS A PAUCITY OF RESEARCH ON THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN YOGIC BREATHING AND HEALTHY LIFESTYLE FACTORS IN WORKING ADULTS. ALSO, THERE IS VERY LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE FREQUENCY OF YOGIC BREATHING PRACTICE AND ITS BENEFITS. THE AUTHORS INVESTIGATED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA (SKY) FREQUENCY AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF LEADING A HEALTHIER LIFESTYLE AMONG PRACTITIONERS AND NONPRACTITIONERS. DESIGN: CROSS-SECTIONAL INVESTIGATION ON NON-SKY AND SKY PRACTITIONERS, SKY WAS CATEGORIZED INTO NON-, MONTHLY, WEEKLY, AND DAILY PRACTITIONERS. CONFOUNDING VARIABLES INCLUDED AGE, GENDER, ETHNICITY, MARITAL STATUS, AND EDUCATION LEVEL. A MULTIVARIATE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL WAS USED TO COMPARE PRACTICE FREQUENCIES WITH THE ODDS OF HAVING A HEALTHIER LIFESTYLE. SETTINGS: COMMUNITY CENTERS, COMMUNITY EVENTS, WORKPLACES, AND UNIVERSITIES THROUGHOUT SINGAPORE SUBJECTS: OF THE 531 WORKING ADULTS (54.8% FEMALE), 50.1% HAD A HEALTHIER LIFESTYLE >/= 4 HEALTHY LIFESTYLE FACTORS). OUTCOME MEASURE: HAVING A HEALTHIER LIFESTYLE WAS DEFINED AS HAVING >/= 4 HEALTHY LIFESTYLE FACTORS OUT OF SEVEN (SMOKING, ALCOHOL, DIET, EXERCISE, SLEEP, STRESS, AND WEIGHT). RESULTS: MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATED THAT THOSE WHO PRACTICED SKY >/= 4 DAYS/WEEK HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ODDS OF HAVING A HEALTHIER LIFESTYLE (ODDS RATIO = 3.62; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL = 2.10-6.23). THE P FOR TREND ANALYSIS DEMONSTRATED THAT AS THE FREQUENCY OF PRACTICE INCREASED THE LIKELIHOOD OF HAVING A HEALTHIER LIFESTYLE ALSO INCREASED ( P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: THE PRACTICE OF YOGIC BREATHING MAY PROMOTE A HEALTHIER LIFESTYLE IN WORKING ADULTS. FURTHER EXPERIMENTAL AND LONGITUDINAL INVESTIGATIONS ARE WARRANTED.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
12 1803  36 PREVALENCE OF DIABETES AND ITS DETERMINANTS IN THE YOUNG ADULTS INDIAN POPULATION-CALL FOR YOGA INTERVENTION. BACKGROUND: THE YOUNG INDIAN POPULATION, WHICH CONSTITUTES 65% OF THE COUNTRY, IS FAST ADAPTING TO A NEW LIFESTYLE, WHICH WAS NOT KNOWN EARLIER. THEY ARE AT A HIGH RISK OF THE INCREASING BURDEN OF DIABETES AND ASSOCIATED COMPLICATIONS. THE NEW EVOLVING LIFESTYLE IS NOT ONLY AFFECTING PEOPLE'S HEALTH BUT ALSO MOUNTING THE MONETARY BURDEN ON A DEVELOPING COUNTRY SUCH AS INDIA. AIM: WE AIMED TO COLLECT INFORMATION REGARDING THE PREVALENCE OF RISK OF DIABETES IN YOUNG ADULTS (<35 YEARS) IN THE 29 MOST POPULOUS STATES AND UNION TERRITORIES (7 ZONES) OF INDIA, USING A VALIDATED QUESTIONNAIRE. METHODS: A USER-FRIENDLY QUESTIONNAIRE-BASED SURVEY USING A MOBILE APPLICATION WAS CONDUCTED ON ALL ADULTS IN THE 29 MOST POPULOUS STATES/UNION TERRITORIES OF INDIA, AFTER OBTAINING ETHICAL CLEARANCE FOR THE STUDY. HERE, WE REPORT THE ESTIMATION OF THE PREVALENCE OF THE RISK OF DIABETES AND SELF-REPORTED DIABETES ON 58,821 YOUNG INDIVIDUALS BELOW THE AGE OF 35 YEARS. RISK FOR DIABETES WAS ASSESSED USING A STANDARDIZED INSTRUMENT, THE INDIAN DIABETES RISK SCORE (IDRS), THAT HAS 4 FACTORS (AGE, FAMILY HISTORY OF DIABETES, WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE, AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY). SPEARMAN'S CORRELATION COEFFICIENT WAS USED TO CHECK THE CORRELATIONS. RESULTS: THE PREVALENCE OF HIGH (IDRS SCORE > 60), MODERATE (IDRS SCORE 30-50), AND LOW (IDRS < 30) DIABETES RISK IN YOUNG ADULTS (<35 YEARS) WAS 10.2%, 33.1%, AND 56.7%, RESPECTIVELY. THOSE WITH HIGH-RISK SCORES WERE HIGHEST (14.4%) IN THE JAMMU ZONE AND LOWEST (4.1%) IN THE CENTRAL ZONE. THE PREVALENCE OF SELF-REPORTED DIABETES WAS 1.8% WITH A SMALL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MEN (1.7%) AND WOMEN (1.9%), AND THE HIGHEST (8.4%) IN THOSE WITH A PARENTAL HISTORY OF DIABETES. THE SOUTH ZONE HAD THE HIGHEST (2.5%), AND THE NORTH WEST ZONE HAD THE LOWEST (4.4%) PREVALENCE. CONCLUSIONS: INDIAN YOUTH ARE AT HIGH RISK FOR DIABETES, WHICH CALLS FOR AN URGENT ACTION PLAN THROUGH INTENSIVE EFFORTS TO PROMOTE LIFESTYLE BEHAVIOR MODIFICATIONS DURING THE PANDEMICS OF BOTH COMMUNICABLE AND NONCOMMUNICABLE DISEASES.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
13  575  37 DEMOGRAPHIC, HEALTH BEHAVIOR, AND CARDIOMETABOLIC RISK FACTOR PROFILE IN YOGA AND NON-YOGA PARTICIPANTS: NHANES 1999-2006. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE AND COMPARE THE DEMOGRAPHIC, HEALTH BEHAVIOR, AND CARDIOMETABOLIC RISK FACTOR CHARACTERISTICS OF PARTICIPANTS WHO REPORT 1) PARTICIPATING IN YOGA, 2) NOT PARTICIPATING YOGA, OR 3) ARE INACTIVE, USING A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF U.S. ADULTS. DESIGN: STUDY PARTICIPANTS WERE FROM THE 1999-2006 NATIONAL HEALTH AND NUTRITION EXAMINATION SURVEY (NHANES) WHO SELF-REPORTED PARTICIPATION IN YOGA (N = 74), NO-YOGA (N = 3,753) OR WERE INACTIVE (N = 1,285). PARTICIPANTS IN THE NO-YOGA GROUP DID ENGAGE IN OTHER TYPES OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, WHILE THE INACTIVE GROUP REPORTED NO ACTIVITY DURING THE SURVEY PERIOD. RESULTS: YOGA PARTICIPANTS WERE PRIMARILY FEMALE (80.7%), COLLEGE EDUCATED (51.9%), MOSTLY NON-SMOKERS (46.9%), AND REPORTED MODERATE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION (72.1%). YOGA PARTICIPANTS WERE FOUND TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS LIKELY TO HAVE AN ELEVATED WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE (OR = 0.40, P < 0.01; OR = 0.30, P < 0.01), AND A LOW HDL (OR = 0.43, P = 0.03; OR = 0.34, P < 0.05) COMPARED TO BOTH NON-YOGA PARTICIPANTS AND INACTIVE INDIVIDUALS, RESPECTIVELY. YOGA PARTICIPANTS WERE 61% LESS LIKELY TO HAVE ELEVATED BLOOD GLUCOSE COMPARED TO NON-YOGA PARTICIPANTS (OR = 0.39, P < 0.05). COMPARED TO INACTIVE INDIVIDUALS, YOGA PARTICIPANTS WERE 52% (OR = 0.48, P < 0.05) AND 66% (OR = 0.34, P < 0.05) LESS LIKELY HAVE AN ELEVATED BODY MASS INDEX AND HAVE ELEVATED TRIGLYCERIDE LEVELS, RESPECTIVELY. CONCLUSIONS: GIVEN THE EMERGENCE OF YOGA AS A COMMON FORM OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, IT IS IMPERATIVE TO UNDERSTAND THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THOSE WHO PARTICIPATE IN YOGA TO FURTHER UNDERSTAND ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH CARDIOVASCULAR RISK. THIS STUDY WAS ONE OF THE FIRST TO USE NATIONALLY-REPRESENTATIVE DATA AND OBJECTIVELY MEASURED CARDIOMETABOLIC VARIABLES. KEY WORDS: COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE, EPIDEMIOLOGY, SURVEY, POPULATION, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
14  518  30 COMPARING ONCE- VERSUS TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN IN PREDOMINANTLY LOW INCOME MINORITIES: A RANDOMIZED DOSING TRIAL. BACKGROUND. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT ONCE-WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES ARE EFFECTIVE FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) IN WHITE ADULTS WITH HIGH SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS. THE COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF TWICE-WEEKLY CLASSES AND GENERALIZABILITY TO RACIALLY DIVERSE LOW INCOME POPULATIONS ARE UNKNOWN. METHODS. WE CONDUCTED A 12-WEEK RANDOMIZED, PARALLEL-GROUP, DOSING TRIAL FOR 95 ADULTS RECRUITED FROM AN URBAN SAFETY-NET HOSPITAL AND FIVE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS COMPARING ONCE-WEEKLY (N = 49) VERSUS TWICE-WEEKLY (N = 46) STANDARDIZED YOGA CLASSES SUPPLEMENTED BY HOME PRACTICE. PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE CHANGE FROM BASELINE TO 12 WEEKS IN PAIN (11-POINT SCALE) AND BACK-RELATED FUNCTION (23-POINT MODIFIED ROLAND-MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE). RESULTS. 82% OF PARTICIPANTS WERE NONWHITE; 77% HAD ANNUAL HOUSEHOLD INCOMES <$40,000. THE SAMPLE'S BASELINE MEAN PAIN INTENSITY [6.9 (SD 1.6)] AND FUNCTION [13.7 (SD 5.0)] REFLECTED MODERATE TO SEVERE BACK PAIN AND IMPAIRMENT. PAIN AND BACK-RELATED FUNCTION IMPROVED WITHIN BOTH GROUPS (P < 0.001). HOWEVER, THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ONCE-WEEKLY AND TWICE-WEEKLY GROUPS FOR PAIN REDUCTION [-2.1 (95% CI -2.9, -1.3) VERSUS -2.4 (95% CI -3.1, -1.8), P = 0.62] OR BACK-RELATED FUNCTION [-5.1 (95% CI -7.0, -3.2) VERSUS -4.9 (95% CI -6.5, -3.3), P = 0.83]. CONCLUSIONS. TWELVE WEEKS OF ONCE-WEEKLY OR TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES WERE SIMILARLY EFFECTIVE FOR PREDOMINANTLY LOW INCOME MINORITY ADULTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN.

15 1699  38 PARTICIPANT CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH SYMPTOMATIC IMPROVEMENT FROM YOGA FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. CONTEXT: STUDIES SUGGEST THAT YOGA IS EFFECTIVE FOR MODERATE TO SEVERE CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) IN DIVERSE PREDOMINANTLY LOWER SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS POPULATIONS. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH BENEFIT FROM THE YOGA INTERVENTION. OBJECTIVE: IDENTIFY FACTORS AT BASELINE INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER EFFICACY AMONG PARTICIPANTS IN A STUDY OF YOGA FOR CLBP. DESIGN: FROM SEPTEMBER-DECEMBER 2011, A 12-WEEK RANDOMIZED DOSING TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED COMPARING WEEKLY VS. TWICE-WEEKLY 75-MINUTE HATHA YOGA CLASSES FOR 95 PREDOMINANTLY LOW-INCOME MINORITY ADULTS WITH NONSPECIFIC CLBP. PARTICIPANT CHARACTERISTICS COLLECTED AT BASELINE WERE USED TO DETERMINE FACTORS BEYOND TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT (REPORTED IN THE INITIAL STUDY) THAT PREDICTED OUTCOME. WE USED BIVARIATE TESTING TO IDENTIFY BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENT IN FUNCTION AND PAIN, AND INCLUDED SELECT FACTORS IN A MULTIVARIATE LINEAR REGRESSION. SETTING: RECRUITMENT AND CLASSES OCCURRED IN AN ACADEMIC SAFETY-NET HOSPITAL AND FIVE AFFILIATED COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS IN BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS. PARTICIPANTS: NINETY-FIVE ADULTS WITH NONSPECIFIC CLBP, AGES RANGING FROM 20-64 (MEAN 48) YEARS; 72 WOMEN AND 23 MEN. OUTCOME MEASURES: PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE CHANGES IN BACK-RELATED FUNCTION (MODIFIED ROLAND-MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE, RMDQ; 0-23) AND MEAN LOW BACK PAIN INTENSITY (0-10) IN THE PREVIOUS WEEK, FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 12. RESULTS: ADJUSTING FOR GROUP ASSIGNMENT, BASELINE RMDQ, AGE, AND GENDER, FOREIGN NATIONALITY AND LOWER BASELINE SF36 PHYSICAL COMPONENT SCORE (PCS) WERE INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENT IN RMDQ. GREATER THAN HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION LEVEL, CLBP LESS THAN 1 YEAR, AND LOWER BASELINE SF36 PCS WERE INDEPENDENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENT IN PAIN INTENSITY. OTHER DEMOGRAPHICS INCLUDING RACE, INCOME, GENDER, BMI, AND USE OF PAIN MEDICATIONS WERE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH EITHER OUTCOME. CONCLUSIONS: POOR PHYSICAL HEALTH AT BASELINE IS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER IMPROVEMENT FROM YOGA IN BACK-RELATED FUNCTION AND PAIN. RACE, INCOME, AND BODY MASS INDEX DO NOT AFFECT THE POTENTIAL FOR A PERSON WITH LOW BACK PAIN TO EXPERIENCE BENEFIT FROM YOGA.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
16 1150  39 ENHANCING ACCESS TO YOGA FOR OLDER MALE VETERANS AFTER CANCER: EXAMINING BELIEFS ABOUT YOGA. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE CLINICAL INTERVENTION FOR CANCER SURVIVORS. MOST STUDIES OF THE POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CANCER PATIENTS REPORT ON PREDOMINANTLY MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER. LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT THE USE OF YOGA IN OLDER ADULTS, VETERANS, AND THOSE FROM DIVERSE RACIAL OR ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS. METHODS: WE EXAMINED STRATEGIES TO ENHANCE ACCESS TO YOGA IN OLDER VETERANS AFTER CANCER, FOCUSING ON EDUCATION (STUDY 1) AND INTERVENTION (STUDY 2). STUDY 1 INCLUDED 110 PARTICIPANTS WITH A MEDIAN (SD) AGE OF 64.9 (9.4) YEARS WHO WERE MOSTLY MALE (99%) CANCER SURVIVORS WHO WERE INTERVIEWED 12 MONTHS AFTER THEIR CANCER DIAGNOSIS. STUDY 2 INCLUDED 28 PARTICIPANTS WITH A MEDIAN (SD) AGE OF 69.2 (10.9) YEARS WHO WERE MOSTLY MALE (96%) CANCER SURVIVORS WHO PARTICIPATED IN A YOGA PROGRAM WITHIN 3 YEARS OF THEIR CANCER DIAGNOSIS. STANDARDIZED INTERVIEWS ASSESSED INTEREST IN AND BARRIERS TO YOGA WHILE SELF-REPORTING ASSESSED HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE AND BELIEFS ABOUT YOGA. RESULTS: IN STUDY 1, INTEREST IN YOGA INCREASED FROM 5.5 TO 31.8% (CHI (2) = 22.25, P < .001) FOLLOWING EDUCATION. IN OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS 4 THEMES RELATED TO NEGATIVE BELIEFS OR BARRIERS EMERGED: LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OR SKEPTICISM, DISINTEREST OR DISLIKE, PHYSICAL HEALTH BARRIERS, AND LOGISTICAL BARRIERS. IN STUDY 2, BELIEFS WERE MORE POSITIVE FOLLOWING INTERVENTION FOR EXPECTED BENEFITS (T = 4.44, P < .001), DISCOMFORT (T = 4.92, P < .001), AND SOCIAL NORMS (T = 4.38, P < .001) RELATED TO YOGA. PHYSICAL FUNCTION IMPROVED AFTER PARTICIPATION IN A YOGA CLASS, ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WITH HIGHER BELIEFS IN YOGA PRIOR TO CLASS. AGE WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH BELIEFS ABOUT YOGA IN EITHER SAMPLE. CONCLUSIONS: A PORTION OF OLDER VETERANS WHO ARE CANCER SURVIVORS WERE INTERESTED IN YOGA BUT FACED ACCESS BARRIERS. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE AND RESEARCH INCLUDE INCREASING KNOWLEDGE ABOUT YOGA BENEFITS AND ADDRESSING PHYSICAL HEALTH AND LOGISTICAL BARRIERS TO ENHANCE ACCESS TO YOGA FOR OLDER VETERANS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
17  567  34 DECLINE IN THE USE OF MEDICALIZED YOGA BETWEEN 2002 AND 2012 WHILE THE OVERALL YOGA USE INCREASED IN THE UNITED STATES: A CONUNDRUM. WE ANALYZED THE NATIONAL HEALTH INSTITUTE SURVEY ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE SUPPLEMENT YOGA DATA FOR 2002, 2007, AND 2012 TO ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS: (1) DO THE CLAIMS ABOUT INCREASE IN THE USE OF YOGA HOLD TRUE AT THE LEVEL OF SPECIFIC HEALTH PROBLEMS? (2) DO TRENDS SUPPORT A PROPOSITION THAT YOGA IS BELIEVED TO BE HELPFUL IN AMELIORATION OF DISEASE CONDITIONS? (3) DO THE PRESCRIBING PATTERNS OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS CORRESPOND WITH THE INCREASING POPULARITY OF YOGA? DATA WERE ANALYZED USING SAS SOFTWARE, VERSION 9.4. RESPONSE PERCENTAGES WERE COMPARED USING CHI-SQUARE TEST AFTER ADJUSTING FOR AGE. BETWEEN 2002 AND 2012, USE OF YOGA INCREASED BUT ADHERENCE FAILED TO INCREASE, AND USE FOR SPECIFIC HEALTH PROBLEMS AND FOR BACK PAIN DECLINED; USE OF HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS' REFERRAL-DRIVEN YOGA DECLINED BETWEEN 2007 AND 2012. ALL RESULTS WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE USE OF MEDICALIZED YOGA DECLINED BETWEEN 2002 AND 2012.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
18 1219  39 EXPOSURE TO ADVERSE EVENTS AND ASSOCIATIONS WITH STRESS LEVELS AND THE PRACTICE OF YOGA: SURVEY FINDINGS FROM A POPULATION-BASED STUDY OF DIVERSE EMERGING YOUNG ADULTS. OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE PREVALENCE OF EXPOSURE TO ADVERSE EVENTS AND ASSOCIATIONS WITH STRESS LEVELS AMONG A DIVERSE POPULATION-BASED SAMPLE OF YOUNG PEOPLE. THE STUDY FURTHER EXPLORES WHETHER THESE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS, WHO HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BENEFIT FROM THE MIND-BODY PRACTICE OF YOGA, ENGAGE IN A REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE. DESIGN: EAT 2018 (EATING AND ACTIVITY OVER TIME) IS A POPULATION-BASED STUDY IN WHICH SURVEY DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM 1568 ETHNICALLY/RACIALLY DIVERSE (81.2% NONWHITE) EMERGING YOUNG ADULTS (MEAN AGE: 22.0 +/- 2.0 YEARS). RESULTS: EXPOSURE TO ADVERSE EVENTS WAS HIGHLY PREVALENT. FOR EXAMPLE, 43.9% REPORTED AT LEAST ONE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCE (ACE) (E.G., PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, OR SEXUAL ABUSE BEFORE AGE 18), WHEREAS 40.1% REPORTED EXPERIENCING DISCRIMINATION. EXPOSURE TO ADVERSE EVENTS WAS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER STRESS LEVELS. PRACTICING YOGA AT LEAST 30 MIN/WEEK WAS REPORTED BY 12.7% OF THE POPULATION, WITH VARIATION ACROSS SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS. YOUNG ADULTS EXPOSED TO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE EITHER MORE OR SIMILARLY LIKELY TO PRACTICE YOGA THAN YOUNG ADULTS NOT REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS. CONCLUSIONS: THE HIGH PREVALENCE OF EXPOSURE TO ADVERSE EVENTS AND ASSOCIATIONS WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF STRESS POINTS TO A NEED FOR PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS. THUS, IT WAS PROMISING TO FIND THAT YOUNG PEOPLE EXPOSED TO ADVERSE EVENTS, WHO MAY HAVE GREATER EMOTIONAL BURDENS, PRACTICE YOGA AT EQUAL OR GREATER PROPORTIONS TO THOSE WITHOUT THESE EXPOSURES. GIVEN THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR POPULATIONS LIVING WITH HIGH STRESS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO DEVELOP FURTHER OUTREACH EFFORTS AND PROVIDE ACCESSIBLE, ACCEPTABLE, AND AFFORDABLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PRACTICING YOGA.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
19 1538  39 KNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDES TOWARD PRENATAL YOGA AMONG WOMEN WITH HIGH-RISK PREGNANCIES. THIS STUDY SOUGHT TO EVALUATE ATTITUDES AND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT PRENATAL YOGA AND TO INVESTIGATE BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS TO YOGA PARTICIPATION IN HIGH-RISK PREGNANT WOMEN RECEIVING PRENATAL CARE IN AN ACADEMIC TERTIARY CARE CENTER. WE SURVEYED A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF WOMEN RECEIVING PRENATAL CARE THROUGH THE MATERNAL-FETAL MEDICINE PRACTICE AT BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL. WE CLASSIFIED PARTICIPANTS AS YOGA-EXPERIENCED OR YOGA-NAIVE DEPENDING ON SELF-REPORT. WE COMPARED DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS USING THE APPROPRIATE NONPARAMETRIC TESTS AND COMPARED BIVARIATE ODDS RATIOS FOR SURVEY RESULTS USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION. OF THE 100 RESPONDENTS, 53% HAD PRACTICED YOGA PREVIOUSLY. WOMEN WITH YOGA EXPERIENCE WERE OLDER (AGE 34.9 +/- 5.6 VS. 31.0 +/- 6.0 YEARS, P = 0.004), MORE LIKELY TO BE COLLEGE GRADUATES (94% VS. 68%, P = 0.002), AND MORE LIKELY TO BE WHITE (77% VS. 47%, P = 0.002) THAN WOMEN WITHOUT PREVIOUS YOGA EXPERIENCE. PREVIOUS YOGA EXPERIENCE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH PARTICIPANT AGREEMENT THAT YOGA WAS SAFE DURING THEIR CURRENT PREGNANCY (ODDS RATIO 5.9, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL 1.9-17.7). OF THE WOMEN SURVEYED, 56% AGREED THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO ATTEND A PRENATAL YOGA CLASS. IN A MULTIVARIATE MODEL INCLUDING AGE, RACE, AND EDUCATION, PREVIOUS YOGA EXPERIENCE WAS THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR ASSOCIATED WITH WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN PRENATAL YOGA CLASSES DURING CURRENT PREGNANCY (ODDS RATIO 3.1, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL 1.1-8.6). PRIOR YOGA EXPERIENCE WAS THE STRONGEST PREDICTOR OF WILLINGNESS TO ATTEND A PRENATAL YOGA CLASS IN OUR POPULATION. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT WOMEN WITH HIGH-RISK PREGNANCIES WHO MAY BENEFIT FROM PRENATAL YOGA INTERVENTIONS BUT LACK PRIOR YOGA EXPERIENCE MAY NEED ADDITIONAL EDUCATION TO FACILITATE PARTICIPATION.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
20  639  28 DO SIDE-EFFECTS/INJURIES FROM YOGA PRACTICE RESULT IN DISCONTINUED USE? RESULTS OF A NATIONAL SURVEY. CONTEXT: YOGA-RELATED INJURIES ARE OF INCREASING CONCERN AS THE USE OF YOGA CONTINUES TO RISE. AIMS: THE AIM OF THE FOLLOWING STUDY IS TO EXAMINE WHETHER A NATIONAL SAMPLE OF YOGA PRACTITIONERS WOULD REPORT DISCONTINUED USE OF YOGA DUE TO INJURY FROM THE PRACTICE, ASSESS WHAT INJURIES RESULTED IN DISCONTINUED USE, DETERMINE WHAT INJURIES WERE MOST COMMON AND IDENTIFY INJURIES REQUIRING MEDICAL ATTENTION. METHODS: SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS OF A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF ADULTS IN THE UNITED STATES (N = 23,393). RESULTS: LESS THAN 1% OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD EVER PRACTICED YOGA (N = 2230) REPORTED AN INJURY FROM YOGA THAT LED TO DISCONTINUED USE. OF THOSE REPORTING INJURY, LESS THAN ONE-THIRD (N = 4) REPORTED SEEKING MEDICAL ATTENTION. THE MOST COMMON SIDE-EFFECT WAS BACK PAIN. APPROXIMATELY, HALF OF THOSE REPORTING BACK PAIN SOUGHT MEDICAL ATTENTION. CONCLUSIONS: INJURY DUE TO YOGA IS AN INFREQUENT BARRIER TO CONTINUED PRACTICE AND SEVERE INJURY DUE TO YOGA IS RARE.	2014

1 2853 161 YOGA, VERTEBRAL FRACTURES, AND OSTEOPOROSIS: RESEARCH AND RECOMMENDATIONS. BACKGROUND: OSTEOPOROSIS IS CHARACTERIZED BY DECREASED BONE DENSITY THAT LEAVES BONES FRAGILE AND HIGHLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO FRACTURE. GLOBALLY, 1 IN 3 WOMEN AND 1 IN 5 MEN OLDER THAN 50 WILL SUFFER FROM AN OSTEOPOROTIC FRACTURE, AND THOSE INDIVIDUALS WILL EXPERIENCE A CONSIDERABLY HIGHER RISK OF POSTFRACTURE MORTALITY THAN WILL THE GENERAL POPULATION. GENTLE, WEIGHT-BEARING EXERCISES SUCH AS YOGA CAN HELP PREVENT OR CEASE THE PROGRESSION OF OSTEOPOROSIS; HOWEVER, THERE IS INSUFFICIENT DATA REGARDING WHICH YOGA POSES PRESENT THE LEAST RISK AND ARE MOST BENEFICIAL TO INDIVIDUALS WITH REDUCED BONE DENSITY. OBJECTIVES: REVIEW THE EXTANT LITERATURE ABOUT THE RISKS AND BENEFITS TO THE SPINE OF PARTICULAR FORMS OF MOVEMENT AND CONSIDER RECOMMENDATIONS RELATIVE TO THE PRACTICE OF YOGA. METHODS: A REVIEW OF THE PUBMED, MEDLINE, AND COCHRANE DATABASES WAS CONDUCTED THAT IDENTIFIED MANUSCRIPTS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1966 AND 2011 ABOUT TOPICS RELATED TO OSTEOPOROSIS AND SPINAL MOVEMENT. CONCLUSIONS: MOVEMENTS INVOLVING SPINAL FLEXION CAN INCREASE RISK FOR VERTEBRAL COMPRESSION FRACTURES; HOWEVER, A COMBINATION OF MILD SPINAL FLEXION AND EXTENSION MAY PROVE BENEFICIAL. MODERATE, WEIGHT-BEARING ACTIVITIES THAT STRENGTHEN THE MUSCLES SUPPORTING THE SPINAL COLUMN, PROMOTE BALANCE, IMPROVE POSTURE, AND ENHANCE QUALITY OF LIFE APPEAR TO BE OF GREATEST BENEFIT. AMPLE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE IMPORTANCE OF VARIED SPINAL MOVEMENT FOR PRESERVING THE HEALTH AND STRENGTH OF THE VERTEBRAL BODIES. EXERCISE MODIFICATIONS SUITABLE FOR HIGH-RISK INDIVIDUALS MAY BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE FOR THOSE AT LOW RISK FOR VERTEBRAL FRACTURES. YOGA THERAPISTS ARE CAUTIONED TO NOT APPLY A ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL APPROACH WHEN WORKING WITH THIS POPULATION. WELL-DESIGNED EMPIRICAL STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO FURTHER OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHICH YOGA POSES PRESENT THE LEAST RISK AND ARE OF GREATEST BENEFIT TO INDIVIDUALS WITH OSTEOPOROSIS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
2  921  41 EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AS THE PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION MODULE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES AND DIABETES ASSOCIATED DEMENTIA IN SOUTH EAST ASIA: A NARRATIVE REVIEW. BACKGROUND: DIABETES MELLITUS (DM) IS WIDELY SPREAD IN SOUTH ASIAN (ASEAN) AND INDIAN SUB-CONTINENT. THE INCREASING HEALTHCARE COSTS OF DM CAN BE PREVENTED IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD BY IMPROVED PUBLIC HEALTHCARE INTERVENTIONS. MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS OF DM LIKE SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE, OBESITY, AND STRESSFUL CONDITIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ITS PROGRESSION; HOWEVER, THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA COLLECTED BY PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS ARE LIMITED. SUMMARY: A REVIEW OF PUBLISHED LITERATURE DESCRIBING GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF DM AND ASSOCIATED DEMENTIA IN SOUTH ASIAN REGION, PARTICULARLY INDIA, WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE PURPOSE OF ASSESSING THE FEASIBILITY AND CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE YOGA-BASED RISK REDUCTION. PUBMED AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR DM AND DEMENTIA-RELATED ARTICLES BY USING A COMBINATION OF KEYWORDS: DIABETES, DIABETES RELATED DEMENTIA SOUTHEAST ASIA, PRE-DIABETES, YOGA, LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION, DEMENTIA AND EXERCISE. THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA GENERATED FROM THESE DISEASES HAVE NOT PROMPTED TO ANY MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH POLICIES. YOGA CAN BE A COST-EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR THE PREVENTION OF TYPE 2 DM (T2DM) AND ITS ASSOCIATED COGNITIVE DECLINE WHEN DETECTED EARLY. IF NATIONWIDE INTERVENTION OF YOGA IS BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE STATE, ITS INTEGRATION IN HEALTH CARE WILL BECOME MORE MEANINGFUL AND ACCEPTABLE. KEY MESSAGE: STUDIES SUGGEST THAT YOGA AND CHANGE IN LIFESTYLE CAN MODIFY THE HEALTH RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH T2DM AND ASSOCIATED DEMENTIA IF IT IS MAINSTREAMED WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH INITIATIVE OF AYUSHMAN BHARAT SCHEME.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
3 2121  39 THE EFFECTIVENESS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF PREGNANCY YOGA INTERVENTIONS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW PROTOCOL. BACKGROUND: THE PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW IS TO SYSTEMATICALLY EXAMINE THE REPORTED CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF PREGNANCY YOGA. THE REVIEW WILL USE THE FITT (FREQUENCY, INTENSITY, TIME/DURATION AND TYPE) PRINCIPLE OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO CHARACTERISE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN EVALUATED IN THE INCLUDED STUDIES. STUDIES WILL BE CATEGORISED AS EFFECTIVENESS OR EFFICACY STUDIES AND THIS CONTINUUM OF EFFICACY VERSUS EFFECTIVENESS WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE FULL REVIEW. METHODS/DESIGN: THE FOLLOWING ELECTRONIC DATABASES WILL BE SEARCHED USING A DETAILED SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, WHOLIS, AMED, SCIELO, ASSIA AND WEB OF SCIENCE. RANDOMISED CONTROL TRIALS AND QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES EXAMINING PREGNANCY YOGA AND REPORTING ON EFFECT WILL BE INCLUDED. TITLES, ABSTRACTS AND FULL ARTICLES WILL BE SCREENED BY TWO INVESTIGATORS INDEPENDENTLY TO IDENTIFY ELIGIBLE STUDIES. THE COCHRANE COLLABORATION'S RISK OF BIAS ASSESSMENT TOOL WILL BE USED TO ASSESS STUDY QUALITY. QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE WILL BE EVALUATED USING THE GRADE CRITERIA. A STANDARDISED DATA EXTRACTION FORM WILL BE USED TO EXTRACT DATA. EFFECT SIZES WILL BE ESTIMATED USING MEAN DIFFERENCES FOR CONTINUOUS OUTCOMES, AND RELATIVE RISKS FOR DICHOTOMOUS OUTCOME. WHERE POSSIBLE, POOLING OF EFFECT ESTIMATES WILL BE DONE USING A RANDOM EFFECT MODEL. THE OUTCOMES OF INTEREST ARE QUALITY OF LIFE, STRESS, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, MODE OF BIRTH, LABOUR DURATION AND PAIN MANAGEMENT IN LABOUR. DISCUSSION: THIS REVIEW WILL SYNTHESISE THE BEST AVAILABLE EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA DURING PREGNANCY AND PROVIDE VALUABLE HIGH-QUALITY INFORMATION FOR CLINICIANS AND HEALTH POLICYMAKERS. FINDINGS WILL BE DISSEMINATED THROUGH PUBLICATION IN A PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL AND PRESENTATION AT RELEVANT CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS. THE REVIEW WILL MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE APPROPRIATE VOLUME, INTENSITY AND TYPE OF PREGNANCY YOGA FOR MAXIMUM EFFECT AND MAY HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND PRACTICE RELATING TO PREGNANCY YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION.

4 1962  41 SELF-REPORTED BENEFITS AND RISKS OF YOGA IN INDIVIDUALS WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER. BACKGROUND: ALTHOUGH HATHA YOGA HAS FREQUENTLY BEEN RECOMMENDED FOR PATIENTS WITH BIPOLAR DISORDER (BD) AND THERE IS PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE THAT IT ALLEVIATES DEPRESSION, THERE ARE NO PUBLISHED DATA ON THE BENEFITS-AND POTENTIAL RISKS-OF YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH BD. THUS, THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE RISKS AND BENEFITS OF YOGA IN INDIVIDUALS WITH BD. METHODS: WE RECRUITED SELF-IDENTIFIED YOGA PRACTITIONERS WITH BD (N=109) TO COMPLETE AN INTERNET SURVEY THAT INCLUDED MEASURES OF DEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL INFORMATION AND OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS ABOUT YOGA PRACTICE AND THE IMPACT OF YOGA. RESULTS: 86 RESPONDENTS PROVIDED SUFFICIENT INFORMATION FOR ANALYSIS, 70 OF WHOM MET POSITIVE SCREENING CRITERIA FOR A LIFETIME HISTORY OF MANIA OR HYPOMANIA. THE MOST COMMON STYLES OF YOGA PREFERRED WERE HATHA AND VINYASA. WHEN ASKED WHAT IMPACT YOGA HAD ON THEIR LIFE, PARTICIPANTS RESPONDED MOST COMMONLY WITH POSITIVE EMOTIONAL EFFECTS, PARTICULARLY REDUCED ANXIETY, POSITIVE COGNITIVE EFFECTS (E.G., ACCEPTANCE, FOCUS, OR "A BREAK FROM MY THOUGHTS"), OR POSITIVE PHYSICAL EFFECTS (E.G., WEIGHT LOSS, INCREASED ENERGY). SOME RESPONDENTS CONSIDERED YOGA TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY LIFE CHANGING. THE MOST COMMON NEGATIVE EFFECT OF YOGA WAS PHYSICAL INJURY OR PAIN. FIVE RESPONDENTS GAVE EXAMPLES OF SPECIFIC INSTANCES OR A YOGA PRACTICE THAT THEY BELIEVED INCREASED AGITATION OR MANIC SYMPTOMS; FIVE RESPONDENTS GAVE EXAMPLES OF TIMES THAT YOGA INCREASED DEPRESSION OR LETHARGY. CONCLUSIONS: MANY INDIVIDUALS WHO SELF-IDENTIFY AS HAVING BD BELIEVE THAT YOGA HAS BENEFITS FOR MENTAL HEALTH. HOWEVER, YOGA IS NOT WITHOUT POTENTIAL RISKS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT YOGA COULD SERVE AS A USEFUL ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT FOR BD.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
5 2454  37 YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR METABOLIC SYNDROME: A NARRATIVE REVIEW. METABOLIC SYNDROME (MS) IS ASSOCIATED WITH A SEDENTARY AND STRESSFUL LIFESTYLE AND AFFECTS UNDERACTIVE PEOPLE DISPROPORTIONATELY. YOGA IS CONSIDERED TO BE A LOW-IMPACT MIND-BODY STRESS-RELIEVING EXERCISE, AND RESEARCHERS ARE INCREASING THEIR FOCUS ON THE BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR MANAGING METABOLIC DISORDERS. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR PHYSICIANS AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS TO UNDERSTAND THE THERAPEUTIC EFFICACY OF YOGA INTERVENTION, IN TERMS OF ITS TYPE, DURATION AND FREQUENCY ON VARIOUS MS RISK FACTORS. THE PRESENT REVIEW SUMMARIZES THE CURRENT SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON MS RISK FACTORS SUCH AS GLUCOSE HOMEOSTASIS MARKERS, LIPID PROFILE, ADIPOCYTOKINES AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS, AND DISCUSSES THE POSSIBLE MECHANISMS OF ACTION. MEDLINE, PUBMED, SCOPUS AND COCHRANE LIBRARY WERE SEARCHED FROM THEIR INCEPTION UP TO DECEMBER 2019, USING THE KEYWORDS "METABOLIC SYNDROME," "DIABETES," "CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES," "OBESITY" AND "YOGA." THE LITERATURE SUMMARIZED IN THIS REVIEW HAVE SHOWN MIXED EFFECTS OF YOGA ON MS RISK FACTORS AND DO NOT PROVIDE ROBUST EVIDENCE FOR ITS EFFICACY. MORE RIGOROUS RESEARCH AND WELL-DESIGNED TRIALS THAT HAVE A HIGHER STANDARD OF METHODOLOGY AND EVALUATE YOGA'S LONG-TERM IMPACTS ON MS ARE NEEDED. UNDERSTANDING YOGA'S BIOCHEMICAL AND MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF ACTION ON VARIOUS METABOLIC PATHWAYS IS ALSO NEEDED.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
6  204  25 A REVIEW OF YOGA PROGRAMS FOR FOUR LEADING RISK FACTORS OF CHRONIC DISEASES. YOGA, A FORM OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, IS RAPIDLY GAINING IN POPULARITY AND HAS MANY HEALTH BENEFITS. YET HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN SLOW TO RECOGNIZE YOGA FOR ITS ABILITY TO IMPROVE HEALTH CONDITIONS, AND FEW INTERVENTIONS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED THAT TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF ITS BENEFITS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO REVIEW PUBLISHED STUDIES USING YOGA PROGRAMS AND TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON COMMON RISK FACTORS OF CHRONIC DISEASES (OVERWEIGHT, HYPERTENSION, HIGH GLUCOSE LEVEL AND HIGH CHOLESTEROL). A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH YIELDED 32 ARTICLES PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1980 AND APRIL 2007. THE STUDIES FOUND THAT YOGA INTERVENTIONS ARE GENERALLY EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING BODY WEIGHT, BLOOD PRESSURE, GLUCOSE LEVEL AND HIGH CHOLESTEROL, BUT ONLY A FEW STUDIES EXAMINED LONG-TERM ADHERENCE. ADDITIONALLY, NOT ENOUGH STUDIES INCLUDED DIVERSE POPULATIONS AT HIGH RISK FOR DIABETES AND ITS RELATED COMMON HEALTH PROBLEMS.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
7 1738  32 PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, YOGA, AND EXERCISE PRESCRIPTION FOR POSTPARTUM AND MIDLIFE WEIGHT MANAGEMENT: A PRACTICAL REVIEW FOR CLINICIANS. THIS NARRATIVE REVIEW IS AIMED TO PRACTICALLY REVIEW AND EVALUATE THE EXISTING EVIDENCE AND ILLUMINATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, YOGA, AND EXERCISE FOR POSTPARTUM AND MIDLIFE WEIGHT MANAGEMENT. A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW WAS CONDUCTED USING ELECTRONIC DATABASES SUCH AS PUBMED AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR USING SEARCH TERMS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, EXERCISE, YOGA, POSTPARTUM, MIDLIFE, WEIGHT LOSS, WEIGHT REDUCTION, AND ALL THE PROBABLE TERMS. THIS HELPED IN GENERATING EVIDENCE-BASED INFORMATION AND FORMULATING PRACTICAL PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PRESCRIPTIONS TO BE USED BY OBSTETRICIANS, GENERAL CLINICIANS, NUTRITIONISTS, AND OTHER ALLIED HEALTHCARE PERSONNEL.

8 1655  27 MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURIES IN YOGA. WHILE YOGA HAS BEEN WIDELY STUDIED FOR ITS BENEFITS TO MANY HEALTH CONDITIONS, LITTLE RESEARCH HAS BEEN PERFORMED ON THE NATURE OF MUSCULOSKELETAL INJURIES OCCURRING DURING YOGA PRACTICE. YOGA IS CONSIDERED TO BE GENERALLY SAFE, HOWEVER, INJURY CAN OCCUR IN NEARLY ANY PART OF THE BODY-ESPECIALLY THE NECK, SHOULDERS, LUMBAR SPINE, HAMSTRINGS, AND KNEES. AS BROAD INTEREST IN YOGA GROWS, SO WILL THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS PRESENTING WITH YOGA-RELATED INJURIES. IN THIS LITERATURE REVIEW, THE PREVALENCE, TYPES OF INJURIES, FORMS OF YOGA RELATED WITH INJURY, SPECIFIC POSES (ASANAS) ASSOCIATED WITH INJURY, AND PREVENTIVE MEASURES ARE DISCUSSED IN ORDER TO FAMILIARIZE PRACTITIONERS WITH YOGA-RELATED INJURIES.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
9 1936  26 ROLE OF YOGA IN THE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF VARIOUS CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES AND THEIR RISK FACTORS: A COMPREHENSIVE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE-BASED REVIEW. CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES (CVDS) ARE A GROUP OF DISORDERS OF THE HEART AND BLOOD VESSELS. CVDS ARE THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATHS WORLDWIDE. THOUGH YOGA IS GAINING POPULARITY AS A THERAPY, ESPECIALLY IN CVD PATIENTS, THERE IS A LACK OF A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW REPORTING ITS ROLE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF VARIOUS CVDS AND THEIR RISK FACTORS. THUS, WE PERFORMED A COMPREHENSIVE LITERATURE SEARCH IN THE PUBMED/MEDLINE ELECTRONIC DATABASE. AN AGGREGATE OF 603 ARTICLES PUBLISHED FROM INCEPTION WERE SCREENED AND 85 ARTICLES THAT ARE APPLICABLE WERE REPORTED. THIS REVIEW SUGGESTS THAT YOGA MAY PLAY A ROLE AS AN ADJUVANT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF VARIOUS CVDS AND THEIR RISK FACTORS. HOWEVER, MANY STUDIES HAD A SMALL SAMPLE SIZE, DIFFERENT TYPES AND DURATIONS OF THE YOGA INTERVENTIONS, AND DID NOT PROVIDE THE DETAILS OF MECHANISMS BEHIND THE IMPROVEMENTS. THUS, FURTHER STUDIES ARE WARRANTED TO EXPLORE THE MECHANISMS OF THE IMPACTS OF YOGA.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
10 1445  33 INCREASING TREND OF YOGA PRACTICE AMONG U.S. ADULTS FROM 2002 TO 2017. INTRODUCTION: BENEFITS, RISKS, AND THE INCREASING POPULARITY OF YOGA USE WARRANT ASSESSING YOGA PRACTICE PREVALENCE AND USERS' PROFILES. THIS STUDY DESCRIBES TRENDS IN YOGA PRACTICE EXCLUSIVELY AMONG AMERICAN ADULTS FROM 2002 TO 2017, COMPARES THE PROFILE OF YOGA USERS, AND IDENTIFIES FACTORS RELATED TO YOGA USE OVER TIME. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS STUDY IS A SECONDARY ANALYSIS DONE IN 2019 AND 2020 USING THE NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY (NHIS) 2002, 2007, 2012, AND 2017 DATA. POPULATION WEIGHTS WERE USED TO OBTAIN STATISTICALLY ACCURATE ESTIMATES OF YOGA USE PREVALENCE FOR THE U.S. POPULATION. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS WERE USED TO PROFILE THE SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND HEALTH-RELATED CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA USERS. MULTIVARIABLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION WAS USED TO IDENTIFY FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA USE IN EACH COHORT DEFINED BY THE NHIS YEAR. RESULTS: YOGA PRACTICE PREVALENCE NEARLY TRIPLED FROM 5.1% IN 2002 TO 13.7% IN 2017 (WEIGHTED ESTIMATE 10,386,456 AND 32,761,194 AMERICAN ADULTS, RESPECTIVELY). TYPICAL YOGA USERS WERE YOUNG NON-HISPANIC SINGLE WHITE FEMALE ADULTS WITH BACHELOR OR HIGHER EDUCATION AND HEALTH INSURANCE, AND RESIDED IN THE WEST REGION OF THE UNITED STATES. YOGA USE PATTERN CHANGE OVER TIME WAS SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO ONLY YOUNGER AGE (P < 0.001) BUT NOT TO OTHER SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC OR HEALTH-RELATED FACTORS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA HAS GAINED INCREASING POPULARITY IN THE PAST TWO DECADES AMONG AMERICAN ADULTS, WITH YOUNGER ADULTS BEING THE DRIVING FORCE. YOGA APPEARS TO BE ADOPTED FOR GENERAL WELL-BEING OR PREVENTION MORE THAN FOR SPECIFIC DISEASE TREATMENT. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD EVALUATE HOW YOGA CAN BE EFFECTIVELY AND SAFELY INTEGRATED INTO PREVENTIVE MEDICINE STRATEGIES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
11 1466  39 INJURY IN YOGA ASANA PRACTICE: ASSESSMENT OF THE RISKS. BACKGROUND: THE RISK OF INJURY FROM MODERN YOGA ASANA PRACTICE IS POORLY CHARACTERIZED IN THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE, BUT ANECDOTAL REPORTS IN THE LAY LITERATURE AND PRESS HAVE POSED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF FREQUENT, SEVERE INJURIES. DESIGN: WE PERFORMED A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY OF YOGA ASANA PARTICIPANTS ASSESSING THEIR EXPERIENCE WITH YOGA-RELATED INJURY, USING A VOLUNTARY CONVENIENCE SAMPLE. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 2620 PARTICIPANTS RESPONDED TO OUR SURVEY. SEVENTY-NINE PERCENT WERE BETWEEN AGES 31 AND 60 AND 84% WERE FEMALE. THE MAJORITY OF RESPONDENTS LIVED IN NORTH AMERICA OR EUROPE. FORTY-FIVE PERCENT OF PARTICIPANTS REPORTED EXPERIENCING NO INJURIES DURING THE TIME THEY HAD BEEN PRACTICING YOGA. OF THOSE WHO DID EXPERIENCE AN INJURY FROM ASANA PRACTICE, 28% WERE MILD (E.G., SPRAINS OR NONSPECIFIC PAINS NOT REQUIRING A MEDICAL PROCEDURE, WITH SYMPTOMS LASTING LESS THAN 6 MONTHS) AND 63% WERE MODERATE (E.G., SPRAINS OR NONSPECIFIC PAINS NOT REQUIRING A MEDICAL PROCEDURE, WITH SYMPTOMS LASTING FROM 6 MONTHS TO 1 YEAR). ONLY 9% OF THOSE REPORTING INJURIES (4% OF THE TOTAL SAMPLE) HAD A SEVERE INJURY. THE STRONGEST PREDICTORS FOR INCREASED PROBABILITY OF REPORTING AN INJURY OVER A LIFETIME OF YOGA PRACTICE WERE GREATER NUMBER OF YEARS OF PRACTICE (P<.0001) AND TEACHING YOGA (P=.0177). OTHER ASPECTS OF PARTICIPANT DEMOGRAPHICS OR YOGA PRACTICE HABITS WERE NOT RELATED TO LIKELIHOOD OF REPORTING A YOGA-RELATED INJURY. CONCLUSIONS: WE FOUND THE NUMBER OF INJURIES REPORTED BY YOGA PARTICIPANTS PER YEARS OF PRACTICE EXPOSURE TO BE LOW AND THE OCCURRENCE OF SERIOUS INJURIES IN YOGA TO BE INFREQUENT COMPARED TO OTHER PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES, SUGGESTING THAT YOGA IS NOT A HIGH-RISK PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. MORE WORK IS NEEDED TO CLARIFY THE CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE YOGA PARTICIPANT CHARACTERISTICS, THE ASANA PRACTICE STYLE, AND THE RISK OF SIGNIFICANT INJURY.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
12 2130  40 THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA TO PREVENT DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2: A PROTOCOL FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM) IS BECOMING A LEADING PROBLEM WORLDWIDE. EMERGING REPORTS REVEAL ALARMING EVIDENCE OF INCREASING PREVALENCE OF T2DM THAT HAS REACHED PANDEMIC LEVELS. DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT INCIDENCE, THERE ARE LIMITED RELIABLE DATA RESOURCES AND COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PEOPLE WHO ARE A PREDIABETIC OR HIGH RISK FOR DEVELOPING T2DM. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROTOCOL IS TO CONDUCT A FULL-SCALE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSES ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PEOPLE WHO ARE PREDIABETES OR HIGH RISK OF DEVELOPING T2DM. METHODS: THE ARTICLES ENROLLED IN THE STUDY WILL BE RETRIEVED FROM THE ONLINE DATABASES BETWEEN 2002 AND THE DATE THE SEARCHES ARE EXECUTED. THE SEARCHES WILL BE REPEATED JUST BEFORE THE FINAL ANALYSES AND FURTHER RELEVANT STUDIES FOR INCLUSION. WE WILL CONDUCT A BIBLIOGRAPHIC SEARCH IN DATABASES: MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, COCHRANE LIBRARY, EBSCO, AND INDMED USING KEYWORDS INCLUDING PREDIABETES STATE, HIGH RISK FOR DIABETES, METABOLIC SYNDROME, AND YOGA. A DEFINED SEARCH STRATEGY WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ALONG WITH SELECTION CRITERIA TO OBTAIN FULL-TEXT ARTICLES OF RELEVANT STUDIES. THIS STUDY PROTOCOL WAS PREPARED ACCORDING TO THE PREFERRED REPORTING ITEMS FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND META-ANALYSIS FOR PROTOCOLS 2015 GUIDELINES. THERE WILL BE NO LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL BE BASED ON PUBLISHED STUDIES AND PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ANONYMIZED DATA WITHOUT DIRECTLY INVOLVING HUMAN PARTICIPANTS AND THEREFORE REQUIRES NEITHER FORMAL HUMAN ETHICAL REVIEW NOR APPROVAL BY A HUMAN RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEE. WE PUBLISHED AN OUTLINE OF THE PROTOCOL IN THE INTERNATIONAL PROSPECTIVE REGISTER OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS (PROSPERO) IN 2018. WE PLAN TO DISSEMINATE THE FINDINGS OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS THROUGH PUBLICATION IN A PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL AND PRESENTATION AT RELEVANT CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS. IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE THE RESULTS OF THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WILL HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND PRACTICE. WE WILL PREPARE POLICYMAKER SUMMARY USING A VALIDATED FORMAT, DISSEMINATE THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA AND EMAIL DISCUSSION GROUPS.

13 1927  32 ROLE OF YOGA IN CARDIAC DISEASE AND REHABILITATION. PURPOSE: CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE CONTINUES TO BE THE LEADING CAUSE OF MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY AROUND THE WORLD. YOGA, A COMBINATION OF PHYSICAL POSTURES (ASANA), BREATHING EXERCISES (PRANAYAMA), AND MEDITATION (DHYANA), HAS GAINED INCREASING RECOGNITION AS A FORM OF MIND-BODY EXERCISE. IN THIS NARRATIVE REVIEW, WE INTENDED TO REVIEW THE EMERGING EVIDENCE ASSESSING THE PHYSIOLOGIC AND CLINICAL EFFECTS OF YOGA ON THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM AND THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF YOGA AS A COMPONENT OF COMPREHENSIVE CARDIAC REHABILITATION. METHODS: WE SEARCHED PUBMED, GOOGLE SCHOLAR, EMBASE, AND COCHRANE DATABASES FOR LITERATURE RELATED TO CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS OF YOGA FROM INCEPTION UP UNTIL 2017. RESULTS: YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE FAVORABLE EFFECTS ON SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION, STRESS, THE CARDIAC AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM, AND TRADITIONAL AND EMERGING CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA HAS SHOWN PROMISE AS A USEFUL LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION THAT CAN BE INCORPORATED INTO CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE MANAGEMENT ALGORITHMS. ALTHOUGH MANY INVESTIGATORS HAVE REPORTED THE CLINICAL BENEFITS OF YOGA IN REDUCING CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS, MORBIDITY, AND MORTALITY, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THESE CONCLUSIONS IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED, THEREBY EMPHASIZING THE NEED FOR LARGE, WELL-DESIGNED RANDOMIZED TRIALS THAT MINIMIZE BIAS AND METHODOLOGICAL DRAWBACKS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
14 1658  36 MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN ASSOCIATED WITH RECREATIONAL YOGA PARTICIPATION: A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY WITH 1-YEAR FOLLOW-UP. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS A POPULAR COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN. THERE ARE FEW STUDIES HOWEVER, THAT HAVE EXAMINED THE RISKS OF RECREATIONAL PARTICIPATION FOR CAUSING MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN. OBJECTIVES: TO EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN AND RECREATIONAL YOGA PARTICIPATION. METHODS: THIS WAS A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY WITH ONE-YEAR FOLLOW-UP. DATA WERE COLLECTED VIA ELECTRONIC QUESTIONNAIRES, ONE YEAR APART. OUTCOMES INCLUDED INCIDENCE AND IMPACT OF PAIN CAUSED BY YOGA AND PREVALENCE OF PAIN CAUSED, EXACERBATED, UNAFFECTED, AND IMPROVED BY YOGA. PREDICTORS INCLUDED AGE, EXPERIENCE, HOURS OF PARTICIPATION, AND INTENSITY OF PARTICIPATION. RESULTS: THE FINAL SAMPLE INCLUDED 354 PARTICIPANTS FROM TWO SUBURBAN YOGA STUDIOS. THE INCIDENCE RATE OF PAIN CAUSED BY YOGA WAS 10.7%. MORE THAN ONE-THIRD OF INCIDENT CASES RESULTED IN LOST YOGA PARTICIPATION TIME AND/OR SYMPTOMS LASTING MORE THAN 3 MONTHS. NONE OF THE RISK FACTORS AT BASELINE INCREASED THE RISK FOR SUBSEQUENT INCIDENT CASES OF PAIN CAUSED BY YOGA. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA CAN CAUSE MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN. PARTICIPANTS MAY BENEFIT FROM DISCLOSURE OF PRACTICE TO THEIR HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS AND BY INFORMING TEACHERS OF INJURIES THEY MAY HAVE PRIOR TO PARTICIPATION. YOGA TEACHERS SHOULD ALSO DISCUSS THE RISKS FOR INJURY WITH THEIR STUDENTS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
15   62  35 A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW ON SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE-BASED EFFECTS (INCLUDING ADVERSE EFFECTS) OF YOGA FOR NORMAL AND HIGH-RISK PREGNANCY-RELATED HEALTH PROBLEMS. WOMEN UNDERGO DISTINCT PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES AND STRESS DURING PREGNANCY THAT ARE ACCOMPANIED BY VARIOUS PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DEMANDS. YOGA IS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY THAT IS COMMONLY USED BY PREGNANT WOMEN AND RECOMMENDED BY HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS. THUS, IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO KNOW ITS EVIDENCE BASED EFFECTS, INCLUDING ADVERSE EFFECTS FROM ALL TYPES OF RESEARCH. A COMPREHENSIVE LITERATURE SEARCH IN PUBMED/MEDLINE ELECTRONIC DATABASE FROM INCEPTION TO 23 SEPTEMBER 2017 WAS PERFORMED USING THE KEYWORDS "YOGA FOR PREGNANCY". IN TOTAL, 137 ARTICLES PUBLISHED SINCE 1979 WERE AVAILABLE. OF THE 137 ARTICLES, 53 ARTICLES WERE INCLUDED FOR THE REVIEW. THIS COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW SUGGESTS THAT YOGA COULD BE CONSIDERED AS AN EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY IN IMPROVING BOTH PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING IN PREGNANT WOMEN DURING PREGNANCY (NORMAL AND HIGH-RISK), CHILDBIRTH, AND POST-PARTUM. HOWEVER, TYPES, DURATION, AND FREQUENCY OF YOGA PRACTICES VARIED AMONG THE STUDIES AND THE EXACT MECHANISMS BEHIND THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ARE LESS UNDERSTOOD AND NEED TO BE EXPLORED.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
16 1926  35 ROLE OF YOGA IN CANCER PATIENTS: EXPECTATIONS, BENEFITS, AND RISKS: A REVIEW. BACKGROUND: THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF CANCER POSES SEVERE PSYCHOLOGIC DISTRESS THAT IMPACTS FUNCTIONAL QUALITY OF LIFE. WHILE CANCER DIRECTED TREATMENTS ARE DIRECTED PURELY AGAINST TUMOR KILLING, INTERVENTIONS THAT REDUCE TREATMENT RELATED DISTRESS AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE ARE THE NEED OF THE HOUR. YOGA IS ONE SUCH MIND BODY INTERVENTION THAT IS GAINING POPULARITY AMONG CANCER PATIENTS. METHOD: SEVERAL RESEARCH STUDIES IN THE LAST TWO DECADES UNRAVEL THE BENEFITS OF YOGA IN TERMS OF IMPROVED MOOD STATES, SYMPTOM REDUCTION, STRESS REDUCTION AND IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE APART FROM IMPROVING HOST FACTORS THAT ARE KNOWN TO AFFECT SURVIVAL IN CANCER PATIENTS. HOWEVER, SEVERAL METAANALYSIS AND REVIEWS SHOW EQUIVOCAL BENEFITS FOR YOGA. IN THIS REVIEW, WE WILL STUDY THE YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN CANCER PATIENTS WITH RESPECT TO EXPECTATIONS, BENEFITS AND RISKS AND ANALYSE THE PRINCIPLES BEHIND TAILORING YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN CANCER PATIENTS. RESULTS: THE STUDIES ON YOGA SHOW HETEROGENEITY WITH VARIED TYPES OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS, DURATION, EXPOSURE, PRACTICES AND INDICATIONS. IT ALSO ELUCIDATES THE SITUATIONAL CONTEXT FOR REAPING BENEFITS AND CAUTIONS AGAINST ITS USE IN SEVERAL OTHERS. HOWEVER, THERE ARE SEVERAL REVIEWS AND BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF EFFECTS OF YOGA; MOST OF THEM HAVE NOT ENLARGED THE SCOPE OF THEIR REVIEW TO COVER THE BASIC PRINCIPLES BEHIND USE OF THESE PRACTICES IN CANCER PATIENTS. CONCLUSION: THIS REVIEW OFFERS INSIGHT INTO THE PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE OF YOGA IN CANCER PATIENTS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
17 2567  27 YOGA FOR DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY: A REVIEW OF PUBLISHED RESEARCH AND IMPLICATIONS FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS. THERE IS INCREASING INTEREST IN THE USE OF YOGA AS WAY TO MANAGE OR TREAT DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY. YOGA IS AFFORD- ABLE, APPEALING, AND ACCESSIBLE FOR MANY PEOPLE, AND THERE ARE PLAUSIBLE COGNITIVE/AFFECTIVE AND BIOLOGIC MECHANISMS BY WHICH YOGA COULD HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY. THERE IS INDEED PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE THAT YOGA MAY BE HELPFUL FOR THESE PROBLEMS, AND THERE ARE SEVERAL ONGOING LARGER-SCALE RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS. THE CURRENT EVIDENCE BASE IS STRONGEST FOR YOGA AS EFFICACIOUS IN REDUCING SYMPTOMS OF UNIPOLAR DEPRESSION. HOWEVER, THERE MAY BE RISKS TO ENGAGING IN YOGA AS WELL. HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS CAN HELP PATIENTS EVALUATE WHETHER A PARTICULAR COMMUNITY-BASED YOGA CLASS IS HELPFUL AND SAFE FOR THEM.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
18 2377  33 WHO PRACTICES YOGA? A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF DEMOGRAPHIC, HEALTH-RELATED, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA PRACTICE. YOGA HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY POPULAR IN THE US AND AROUND THE WORLD, YET BECAUSE MOST YOGA RESEARCH IS CONDUCTED AS CLINICAL TRIALS OR EXPERIMENTS, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE CHARACTERISTICS AND CORRELATES OF PEOPLE WHO INDEPENDENTLY CHOOSE TO PRACTICE YOGA. WE CONDUCTED A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THIS ISSUE, IDENTIFYING 55 STUDIES AND CATEGORIZING CORRELATES OF YOGA PRACTICE INTO SOCIODEMOGRAPHICS, PSYCHOSOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS, AND MENTAL AND PHYSICAL WELL-BEING. YOGA USE IS GREATEST AMONG WOMEN AND THOSE WITH HIGHER SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AND APPEARS FAVORABLY RELATED TO PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS SUCH AS COPING AND MINDFULNESS. YOGA PRACTICE OFTEN RELATES TO BETTER SUBJECTIVE HEALTH AND HEALTH BEHAVIORS BUT ALSO WITH MORE DISTRESS AND PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENT. HOWEVER, EVIDENCE IS SPARSE AND METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS PRECLUDE DRAWING CAUSAL INFERENCES. NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE STUDIES HAVE MINIMALLY ASSESSED YOGA WHILE STUDIES WITH STRONG ASSESSMENT OF YOGA PRACTICE (E.G., TYPE, DOSE) ARE GENERALLY CONDUCTED WITH CONVENIENCE SAMPLES. ALMOST ALL STUDIES REVIEWED ARE CROSS-SECTIONAL AND FEW CONTROL FOR POTENTIAL CONFOUNDING VARIABLES. WE PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE CORRELATES OF YOGA PRACTICE.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
19 2619  22 YOGA FOR STRESS REDUCTION AND INJURY PREVENTION AT WORK. AT WORK EMPLOYEES FACE NUMEROUS PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESSORS THAT CAN UNDERMINE THEIR WORK PERFORMANCE. THESE STRESSORS, STEMMING FROM A VARIETY OF POSSIBLE CAUSES, HAVE ENORMOUS HEALTH AND FINANCIAL IMPACTS ON EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS EMPLOYERS. STRESS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE ONE OF THE FACTORS LEADING TO MUSCULO-SKELETAL DISORDERS (MSDS) SUCH AS: INCLUDE BACK PAIN, CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME, SHOULDER OR NECK TENSION, EYE STRAIN, OR HEADACHES. YOGA IS AN ANCIENT FORM OF EXERCISE THAT CAN REDUCE STRESS AND RELIEVE MUSCULAR TENSION OR PAIN. PRACTICING YOGA AT THE WORKPLACE TEACHES EMPLOYEES TO USE RELAXATION TECHNIQUES TO REDUCE STRESS AND RISKS OF INJURY ON THE JOB. YOGA AT THE WORKPLACE IS A CONVENIENT AND PRACTICAL OUTLET THAT IMPROVES WORK PERFORMANCE BY RELIEVING TENSION AND JOB STRESS.	2002	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
20 2426  29 YOGA AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH: INTEGRATIVE REVIEW OF INTERVENTION STUDIES. BACKGROUND: EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED IN SEVERAL FIELDS. OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE AND ANALYZE RESULTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN THE WORKPLACE REPORTED ALONG 10 YEARS AFTER THE FORMULATION OF THE NATIONAL POLICY OF INTEGRATIVE AND COMPLEMENTARY PRACTICES. METHOD: WE LOCATED 10 STUDIES PUBLISHED FROM 2006 TO 2015 WHICH MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA, INCLUDED IN DATABASES CUMULATIVE INDEX OF NURSING AND ALLIED HEALTH LITERATURE (CINAHL), MEDICAL LITERATURE ANALYSES AND RETRIEVAL SYSTEM ONLINE (MEDLINE), WEB OF SCIENCE, SCOPUS, COCHRANE AND SCIENTIFIC ELECTRONIC LIBRARY ONLINE (SCIELO). ANALYZED VARIABLES WERE: PUBLICATION YEAR, AUTHORSHIP, TITLE, AIMS, RESULTS, AND CONCLUSIONS. INTERVENTIONS WERE CHARACTERIZED BASED ON YOGA STYLE, PRACTICES IMPLEMENTED, FREQUENCY AND DURATION OF SESSIONS, DURATION OF INTERVENTION, MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENTS, AND ADDITIONAL INTERVENTIONS. RESULTS: OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA HAS PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS ON WORKERS FROM DIFFERENT PROFESSIONAL CATEGORIES. HOWEVER, WE DID NOT FIND BENEFITS FOR SOME CONDITIONS, AND YOGA PRACTICE DOES NOT HAVE THE SAME POSITIVE EFFECTS ON ALL PRACTITIONERS. WORKERS' ADHERENCE TO PROGRAMS INFLUENCES THE RESULTS OF RESEARCH. MANY STUDIES DID NOT CLEARLY DESCRIBE THE IMPLEMENTED PROGRAMS. CONCLUSION: THE CHARACTERISTICS OF INTERVENTIONS SHOW SUBSTANTIAL DIFFERENCES AMONG PROGRAMS, WHICH ENABLE A SYNTHESIS, BUT NOT COMPARISONS.	2018

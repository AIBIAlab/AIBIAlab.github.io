1  836 156 EFFECT OF YOGA ON PATIENTS WITH CANCER: OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERAPEUTIC YOGA IMPROVES THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF PATIENTS WITH CANCER. DATA SOURCES: SEARCH OF MEDLINE DATABASE (1950-2010) USING KEY WORDS YOGA, CANCER, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. STUDY SELECTION: PRIORITY WAS GIVEN TO RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL STUDIES CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON TYPICAL SYMPTOMS OF PATIENTS WITH CANCER IN NORTH AMERICA. SYNTHESIS: INITIALLY, 4 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL STUDIES WERE ANALYZED, THEN 2 STUDIES WITHOUT CONTROL GROUPS WERE ANALYZED. THREE STUDIES CONDUCTED IN INDIA AND THE NEAR EAST PROVIDED INTERESTING INFORMATION ON METHODOLOGIES. THE INTERVENTIONS INCLUDED YOGA SESSIONS OF VARYING LENGTH AND FREQUENCY. THE PARAMETERS MEASURED ALSO VARIED AMONG STUDIES. SEVERAL SYMPTOMS IMPROVED SUBSTANTIALLY WITH YOGA (HIGHER QUALITY OF SLEEP, DECREASE IN SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, IMPROVEMENT IN SPIRITUAL WELL-BEING, ETC). IT WOULD APPEAR THAT QUALITY OF LIFE, OR SOME ASPECTS THEREOF, ALSO IMPROVED. CONCLUSION: THE VARIETY OF BENEFITS DERIVED, THE ABSENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS, AND THE COST-BENEFIT RATIO OF THERAPEUTIC YOGA MAKE IT AN INTERESTING ALTERNATIVE FOR FAMILY PHYSICIANS TO SUGGEST TO THEIR PATIENTS WITH CANCER. CERTAIN METHODOLOGIC SHORTCOMINGS, INCLUDING THE LIMITED SIZE OF THE SAMPLES AND VARYING LEVELS OF ATTENDANCE ON THE PART OF THE SUBJECTS, MIGHT HAVE REDUCED THE STATISTICAL STRENGTH OF THE STUDIES PRESENTED. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE MEASUREMENT SCALES USED DID NOT SUIT THIS TYPE OF SITUATION AND PATIENT POPULATION, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT. HOWEVER, FAVOURABLE COMMENTS BY PARTICIPANTS DURING THE STUDIES AND THEIR LEVEL OF APPRECIATION AND WELL-BEING SUGGEST THAT FURTHER RESEARCH IS CALLED FOR TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS OF THESE EFFECTS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
2 2383  40 YOGA & CANCER INTERVENTIONS: A REVIEW OF THE CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOMES FOR CANCER SURVIVORS. LIMITED RESEARCH SUGGESTS YOGA MAY BE A VIABLE GENTLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OPTION WITH A VARIETY OF HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, PSYCHOSOCIAL AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT BENEFITS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO DETERMINE THE CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES FROM YOGA INTERVENTIONS CONDUCTED WITH CANCER SURVIVORS. A TOTAL OF 25 PUBLISHED YOGA INTERVENTION STUDIES FOR CANCER SURVIVORS FROM 2004-2011 HAD PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES, INCLUDING QUALITY OF LIFE, PSYCHOSOCIAL OR SYMPTOM MEASURES. THIRTEEN OF THESE STUDIES MET THE NECESSARY CRITERIA TO ASSESS CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE FOR EACH OF THE OUTCOMES OF INTEREST WAS EXAMINED BASED ON 1 STANDARD ERROR OF THE MEASUREMENT, 0.5 STANDARD DEVIATION, AND RELATIVE COMPARATIVE EFFECT SIZES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE CONFIDENCE INTERVALS. THIS REVIEW DESCRIBES IN DETAIL THESE PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES, HOW THEY WERE OBTAINED, THEIR RELATIVE CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPLICATIONS FOR BOTH CLINICAL AND RESEARCH SETTINGS. OVERALL, CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES SUGGEST THAT YOGA INTERVENTIONS HOLD PROMISE FOR IMPROVING CANCER SURVIVORS' WELL-BEING. THIS RESEARCH OVERVIEW PROVIDES NEW DIRECTIONS FOR EXAMINING HOW CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE CAN PROVIDE A UNIQUE CONTEXT FOR DESCRIBING CHANGES IN PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES FROM YOGA INTERVENTIONS. RESEARCHERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO EMPLOY INDICES OF CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE IN THE INTERPRETATION AND DISCUSSION OF RESULTS FROM YOGA STUDIES.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
3 2170  36 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON ANXIETY AND STRESS. STRESS AND ANXIETY HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED AS CONTRIBUTORS TO MANY CHRONIC DISEASES AND TO DECREASED QUALITY OF LIFE, EVEN WITH PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT. EFFORTS ARE UNDERWAY TO FIND NON-PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPIES TO RELIEVE STRESS AND ANXIETY, AND YOGA IS ONE OPTION FOR WHICH RESULTS ARE PROMISING. THE FOCUS OF THIS REVIEW IS ON THE RESULTS OF HUMAN TRIALS ASSESSING THE ROLE OF YOGA IN IMPROVING THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF STRESS AND ANXIETY. OF 35 TRIALS ADDRESSING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON ANXIETY AND STRESS, 25 NOTED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN STRESS AND/OR ANXIETY SYMPTOMS WHEN A YOGA REGIMEN WAS IMPLEMENTED; HOWEVER, MANY OF THE STUDIES WERE ALSO HINDERED BY LIMITATIONS, SUCH AS SMALL STUDY POPULATIONS, LACK OF RANDOMIZATION, AND LACK OF A CONTROL GROUP. FOURTEEN OF THE 35 STUDIES REPORTED BIOCHEMICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL MARKERS OF STRESS AND ANXIETY, BUT YIELDED INCONSISTENT SUPPORT OF YOGA FOR RELIEF OF STRESS AND ANXIETY. EVALUATION OF THE CURRENT PRIMARY LITERATURE IS SUGGESTIVE OF BENEFITS OF YOGA IN RELIEVING STRESS AND ANXIETY, BUT FURTHER INVESTIGATION INTO THIS RELATIONSHIP USING LARGE, WELL-DEFINED POPULATIONS, ADEQUATE CONTROLS, RANDOMIZATION AND LONG DURATION SHOULD BE EXPLORED BEFORE RECOMMENDING YOGA AS A TREATMENT OPTION.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
4 2915  40 [SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF YOGA FOR DEPRESSION AND QUALITY OF SLEEP IN THE ELDERLY]. BACKGROUND: AGING AND AGE-RELATED HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE MAJOR ISSUES OF CONCERN FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH SERVICES. YOGA IS AN EXERCISE WITH BOTH PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS ON AGING. ALTHOUGH MANY STUDIES HAVE ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN THE ELDERLY, LITTLE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE IN THE LITERATURE TO SUPPORT EMPIRICAL CONCLUSIONS. PURPOSE: THIS REVIEW SYNTHESIZES AND CHARACTERIZES FINDINGS RELATED TO THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON DEPRESSION AND QUALITY OF SLEEP IN THE ELDERLY. METHODS: RESEARCHERS USED KEYWORDS INCLUDING YOGA, ELDERLY, AGED / OLDER ADULT, DEPRESSION, SLEEP, AND QUALITY TO SEARCH 6 ELECTRONIC DATABASES FOR RELEVANT STUDIES PUBLISHED PRIOR TO MARCH 2013. INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA WERE USED TO SCREEN IDENTIFIED STUDY ABSTRACTS. THE JADAD SCALE APPRAISED THE QUALITY OF IDENTIFIED STUDIES. RESULTS: SEVEN STUDIES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. FIVE STUDIES FOUND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PARTICIPANT DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AFTER DOING YOGA. THREE STUDIES FOUND SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON THE QUALITY OF SLEEP OF PARTICIPANTS AFTER 6 MONTHS OF DOING YOGA. CONCLUSION: YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS OF ELDERLY PARTICIPANTS AND IMPROVED THEIR QUALITY OF SLEEP AFTER 6 MONTHS. FINDINGS WERE SIMILAR FOR ELDERLY LIVING IN INSTITUTIONS AND IN THE COMMUNITY. HOWEVER, THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE ASSESSED STUDIES WERE WOMEN CHARACTERIZED BY A HIGH LEVEL OF SOCIAL PARTICIPATION AND PROACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN HEALTH PROMOTION ACTIVITIES. FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD BROADEN THE SCOPE OF RESEARCH TO ADDRESS DIFFERENT AGING POPULATIONS AND USE LONG-TERM COHORT OBSERVATIONS IN ORDER TO BETTER ELICIT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AND TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO INTRODUCE YOGA INTO DAILY ACTIVITIES.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
5 2488  34 YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR THE REDUCTION OF SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW IS TO EVALUATE THE IMPLEMENTATION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR THE REDUCTION OF SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION IN YOUTH. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THERE ARE NO SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS TO DATE LOOKING AT THE REDUCTION OF SYMPTOMS OF BOTH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. METHODS: NUMEROUS SCIENTIFIC DATABASES WERE SEARCHED UP TO NOVEMBER 2018 FOR EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES ASSESSING CHANGES IN SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AND/OR DEPRESSION IN YOUTHS FOLLOWING YOGA INTERVENTIONS. QUALITY AND LEVEL OF EVIDENCE WERE ASSESSED, AND INFORMATION WAS SYNTHESIZED ACROSS STUDIES. RESULTS: TWENTY-SEVEN STUDIES INVOLVING YOUTH WITH VARYING HEALTH STATUSES WERE REVIEWED. INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS VARIED GREATLY ACROSS STUDIES REVEALING MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT MAY IMPACT INTERVENTION EFFICACY, HOWEVER 70% OF THE STUDIES OVERALL SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS. FOR STUDIES ASSESSING ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, 58% SHOWED REDUCTIONS IN BOTH SYMPTOMS, WHILE 25% SHOWED REDUCTIONS IN ANXIETY ONLY. ADDITIONALLY, 70% OF STUDIES ASSESSING ANXIETY ALONE SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS AND 40% OF STUDIES ONLY ASSESSING DEPRESSION SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS. CONCLUSION: THE STUDIES REVIEWED, WHILE OF WEAK TO MODERATE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY, SHOWED THAT YOGA, DEFINED BY THE PRACTICE OF POSTURES, GENERALLY LEADS TO SOME REDUCTIONS IN ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION IN YOUTH REGARDLESS OF HEALTH STATUS AND INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
6 2200  29 THE EFFICACY OF YOGA AS A FORM OF TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE WAS TO SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEW YOGA INTERVENTIONS AIMED AT IMPROVING DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. A TOTAL OF 23 INTERVENTIONS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 2011 AND MAY 2016 WERE EVALUATED IN THIS REVIEW. THREE STUDY DESIGNS WERE USED: RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS, QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL, AND PRETEST/POSTTEST, WITH MAJORITY BEING RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS. MOST OF THE STUDIES WERE IN THE UNITED STATES. VARIOUS YOGA SCHOOLS WERE USED, WITH THE MOST COMMON BEING HATHA YOGA. THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS PARTICIPATING IN THE STUDIES RANGED FROM 14 TO 136, IMPLYING THAT MOST STUDIES HAD A SMALL SAMPLE. THE DURATION OF THE INTERVENTION PERIOD VARIED GREATLY, WITH THE MAJORITY BEING 6 WEEKS OR LONGER. LIMITATIONS OF THE INTERVENTIONS INVOLVED THE SMALL SAMPLE SIZES USED BY THE MAJORITY OF THE STUDIES, MOST STUDIES EXAMINING THE SHORT-TERM EFFECT OF YOGA FOR DEPRESSION, AND THE NONUTILIZATION OF BEHAVIORAL THEORIES. DESPITE THE LIMITATIONS, IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT THE YOGA INTERVENTIONS WERE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING DEPRESSION.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
7 1084  37 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS MANAGEMENT IN HEALTHY ADULTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVE: THIS ARTICLE REPORTS A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON STRESS MANAGEMENT IN HEALTHY ADULTS. METHODS: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE SEARCH WAS PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) AND CLINICAL CONTROLLED TRIALS (CCTS) THAT ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS MANAGEMENT IN HEALTHY ADULTS. SELECTED STUDIES WERE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE TYPES OF INTERVENTION, DURATION, OUTCOME MEASURES, AND RESULTS. THEY WERE ALSO QUALITATIVELY ASSESSED BASED ON PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS. RESULTS: THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS BASED ON EIGHT RCTS AND CCTS THAT INDICATED A POSITIVE EFFECT OF YOGA IN REDUCING STRESS LEVELS OR STRESS SYMPTOMS. HOWEVER, MOST OF THE STUDIES HAD METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS IN THAT THE INTERVENTION DURATION WAS SHORT AND LIMITED FOLLOW-UP DATA WAS AVAILABLE. CONCLUSION: THIS REVIEW REVEALED POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS REDUCTION IN HEALTHY ADULT POPULATIONS. HOWEVER, THE RESULT SHOULD BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION DUE TO THE SMALL NUMBER OF STUDIES AND THE ASSOCIATED METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS. FURTHER STUDIES TO ASCERTAIN YOGA'S LONG-TERM EFFECTS AND THE UNDERLYING BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS LEADING TO ITS STRESS REDUCTION EFFECT SHOULD BE CONDUCTED.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
8 2292  34 THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF YOGA FOR CHILDREN: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE. PURPOSE: WE COMPLETED A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE ON THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE AND PHYSICAL OUTCOME MEASURES IN THE PEDIATRIC POPULATION. WE EXPLORED VARIOUS DATABASES AND INCLUDED CASE-CONTROL AND PILOT STUDIES, COHORT AND RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS THAT EXAMINED YOGA AS AN EXERCISE INTERVENTION FOR CHILDREN. SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS: USING THE SACKETT LEVELS OF EVIDENCE, THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS THE LITERATURE ON YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY MIND-BODY MOVEMENT THERAPY. WE ADDRESS THE RESEARCH THROUGH THREE PRACTICE PATTERNS ACCORDING TO THE GUIDE TO PHYSICAL THERAPIST PRACTICE AND PROVIDE CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE INCLUSION OF YOGA INTO CLINICAL PRACTICE. STATEMENT OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: THE EVIDENCE SHOWS PHYSIOLOGICAL BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR THE PEDIATRIC POPULATION THAT MAY BENEFIT CHILDREN THROUGH THE REHABILITATION PROCESS, BUT LARGER CLINICAL TRIALS, INCLUDING SPECIFIC MEASURES OF QUALITY OF LIFE ARE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE DEFINITIVE EVIDENCE.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
9 2105  32 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON MENSTRUAL DISORDERS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVE: TO SUMMARIZE AND EVALUATE EVIDENCE FOR THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON MENSTRUAL DISORDERS. METHODS: PUBMED, CINAHL/MEDLINE, WEB OF SCIENCE, AMED, AND SCOPUS WERE SEARCHED FOR ENGLISH-LANGUAGE LITERATURE RELEVANT TO THE REVIEW QUESTION. ALL PRIMARY RESEARCH STUDIES WERE INCLUDED. RESULTS: FIFTEEN STUDIES DESCRIBED IN 18 PAPERS WERE INCLUDED IN THE REVIEW. A RANGE OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS WERE USED. SOME STUDIES USED A COMBINATION OF ASANA, PRANAYAMA, AND OTHER YOGIC RELAXATION OR MEDITATION TECHNIQUES. ALL INCLUDED STUDIES REPORTED SOME CHANGE IN THEIR OUTCOME MEASURES, SUGGESTING REDUCED SYMPTOMS OF MENSTRUAL DISTRESS FOLLOWING A YOGA INTERVENTION; HOWEVER, THE HETEROGENEITY AND INTENSITY OF THE INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOME MEASURES MEANT THAT FINDINGS HAVE LIMITED GENERALIZABILITY AND APPLICABILITY IN PRACTICE SETTINGS. CONCLUSIONS: FURTHER RESEARCH ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOGA PRACTICE AND MENSTRUAL DISORDERS IS WARRANTED, BUT THERE MUST BE BOTH CONSISTENCY IN THE METHODS, MEASURES, AND QUALITY OF STUDIES AND A SHIFT TOWARD RESEARCH ON YOGA PRACTICES THAT ARE REPLICABLE OUTSIDE OF THE CLINICAL TRIAL SETTING.	2017

METHODS: THIS REVIEW PROVIDES A GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO YOGA AND A DETAILED REVIEW OF YOGA RESEARCH IN CANCER. RESULTS: NINE STUDIES CONDUCTED WITH CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS YIELDED MODEST IMPROVEMENTS IN SLEEP QUALITY, MOOD, STRESS, CANCER-RELATED DISTRESS, CANCER-RELATED SYMPTOMS, AND OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE. STUDIES CONDUCTED IN OTHER PATIENT POPULATIONS AND HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS HAVE SHOWN BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOMATIC SYMPTOMS, AS WELL AS OTHER ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL FUNCTION. CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS FROM THE EMERGING LITERATURE ON YOGA AND CANCER PROVIDE PRELIMINARY SUPPORT FOR THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFICACY OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR CANCER PATIENTS, ALTHOUGH CONTROLLED TRIALS ARE LACKING. FURTHER RESEARCH IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE RELIABILITY OF THESE EFFECTS AND TO IDENTIFY THEIR UNDERLYING MECHANISMS.	2005	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
11 1945  40 SALUTE TO THE SUN: A NEW DAWN IN YOGA THERAPY FOR BREAST CANCER. INTRODUCTION: INTEREST IN THE APPLICATION OF YOGA FOR HEALTH BENEFITS IN WESTERN MEDICINE IS GROWING RAPIDLY, WITH A SIGNIFICANT RISE IN PUBLICATIONS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INCLUSION OF YOGA THERAPY TO THE TREATMENT OF BREAST CANCER CAN IMPROVE THE PATIENT'S PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). METHODS: A SEARCH OF PEER REVIEWED JOURNAL ARTICLES PUBLISHED BETWEEN JANUARY 2009 AND JULY 2014 WAS CONDUCTED. STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IF THEY HAD MORE THAN 15 STUDY PARTICIPANTS, INCLUDED INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION (MBSR) OR YOGA THERAPY WITH OR WITHOUT COMPARISON GROUPS AND HAD STATED PHYSICAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES. RESULTS: SCREENING IDENTIFIED 38 APPROPRIATE ARTICLES. THE MOST REPORTED PSYCHOSOCIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA THERAPY WERE ANXIETY, EMOTIONAL AND SOCIAL FUNCTIONING, STRESS, DEPRESSION AND GLOBAL QOL. THE MOST REPORTED PHYSICAL BENEFITS OF YOGA THERAPY WERE IMPROVED SALIVARY CORTISOL READINGS, SLEEP QUALITY AND LYMPHOCYTE APOPTOSIS. BENEFITS IN THESE AREAS WERE LINKED STRONGLY WITH THE YOGA INTERVENTIONS, IN ADDITION TO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN OVERALL QOL. CONCLUSION: THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE USE OF YOGA THERAPY TO IMPROVE THE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL QOL FOR BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WITH A RANGE OF BENEFITS RELEVANT TO RADIATION THERAPY. FUTURE STUDIES ARE RECOMMENDED TO CONFIRM THESE BENEFITS. EVIDENCE-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF A YOGA THERAPY PROGRAMME HAVE BEEN DERIVED AND INCLUDED WITHIN THIS REVIEW. LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP IS NECESSARY WITH THESE PROGRAMMES TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF THE YOGA INTERVENTION IN TERMS OF SUSTAINABILITY AND PATIENT OUTCOMES.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
12 2684  43 YOGA IN THE PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY POPULATION: A REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE. BACKGROUND: THE PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO EVALUATE THE CURRENT BODY OF LITERATURE ON YOGA IN THE PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY POPULATION. CONSIDERING THE INCREASING NUMBER OF STUDIES ON YOGA INDICATING IMPROVEMENTS IN HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQL) AMONG THE ADULT ONCOLOGY POPULATION, IT IS IMPORTANT TO EXPLORE WHETHER SIMILAR BENEFITS HAVE BEEN FOUND IN PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY PATIENTS. METHODS: CINAHL, OVID MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, PUBMED, AND SCOPUS WERE SEARCHED FROM THE YEARS 2010 THROUGH 2020 FOR STUDIES ASSESSING THE USE OF YOGA IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS AFFECTED BY CANCER. CONSIDERING THE BENEFITS OF YOGA ON HRQL IN THE ADULT ONCOLOGY POPULATION, THE AIM OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO EVALUATE THE CURRENT BODY OF LITERATURE ON YOGA IN THE PEDIATRIC CANCER POPULATION. RESULTS: EIGHT STUDIES, ALL NONRANDOMIZED WITH SINGLE-ARM DESIGNS, WERE REVIEWED. FIVE OF THE STUDIES WERE DESIGNED AS FEASIBILITY STUDIES AND WHILE RECRUITMENT RATES RANGED FROM 34% TO 55%, RETENTION RATES WERE APPROXIMATELY 70%. QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK FROM PARTICIPANTS WAS VERY POSITIVE AND THEMES RELATED TO BOTH PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFITS. CERTAIN MEASURES OF HRQL (I.E., ANXIETY, PAIN, AND PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING) WERE FOUND TO BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED FOLLOWING A YOGA INTERVENTION. DISCUSSION: ALTHOUGH NO RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED TO DATE ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC, THE STUDIES REVIEWED SHOWED THAT DELIVERING YOGA TO THIS POPULATION IS FEASIBLE AND SAFE. ADDITIONALLY, PRELIMINARY FINDINGS ON THE IMPACT OF YOGA FOR SOME OF THE COMMON SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT-RELATED SIDE EFFECTS EXPERIENCED BY CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS AFFECTED BY CANCER ARE PROMISING.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
13 2023  47 SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF YOGA FOR SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT DURING CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. INTRODUCTION: BREAST CANCER IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY DIAGNOSED CANCERS IN WOMEN IN THE US, AND ITS TREATMENTS HAVE SIGNIFICANT PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SIDE EFFECTS AND LONG-TERM COMPLICATIONS CAUSING SIGNIFICANT MORBIDITY AND DECREASED QUALITY OF LIFE. INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE MODALITIES, SUCH AS YOGA, HAVE BEEN FOUND TO REDUCE SIDE EFFECTS OF CONVENTIONAL TREATMENTS WITHOUT INTERFERING WITH THE TREATMENT ITSELF AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE. IN THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW, WE SPECIFICALLY EXPLORED YOGA AS A POTENTIAL OPTION FOR SYMPTOMATIC MANAGEMENT IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING CONVENTIONAL BREAST CANCER TREATMENTS. METHODS: WE PERFORMED A LITERATURE SEARCH THAT WAS CONDUCTED TO INCLUDE THE DATABASES PUBMED, PSYCHINFO, COCHRANE LIBRARY, SCOPUS, AND CINAHL, RESULTING IN 28 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) ARTICLES. WE REVIEW THE RESULTS OF THESE TRIALS REGARDING THE IMPACT OF YOGA IN THIS PATIENT POPULATION. RESULTS: OVERALL, THE MAJORITY OF THE RCT ARTICLES SHOWED SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS OF YOGA INTERVENTION IN VARIOUS ASPECTS OF QUALITY OF LIFE, FATIGUE, NAUSEA/VOMITING, SLEEP QUALITY, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND DISTRESS. THERE ARE SEVERAL STUDIES THAT HAVE EXPLORED THE PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISM BEHIND THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND FOUND THAT YOGA AFFECTS BOTH THE IMMUNE RESPONSE AND INFLAMMATION. DISCUSSION: THESE STUDIES REVEALED THAT YOGA HAS A POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC ROLE IN THE SYMPTOMATIC MANAGEMENT OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS, ENHANCING QUALITY OF LIFE DURING TREATMENT AS WELL AS IMPROVING ADHERENCE TO TREATMENT. FUTURE STUDIES WITH MORE DEFINED AND CONSISTENT METHODOLOGIES ARE NECESSARY TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL USE OF YOGA THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
14 1088  31 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SYMPTOMS, PHYSICAL FUNCTION, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES IN ADULTS WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS: A FOCUSED REVIEW. OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) IS A HIGHLY PREVALENT AND DISABLING CHRONIC CONDITION. BECAUSE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS A KEY COMPONENT IN OA MANAGEMENT, EFFECTIVE EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS ARE NEEDED. YOGA IS AN INCREASINGLY POPULAR MULTIMODAL MIND-BODY EXERCISE THAT AIMS TO PROMOTE FLEXIBILITY, STRENGTH, ENDURANCE, AND BALANCE. ITS GENTLE APPROACH IS POTENTIALLY A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE EXERCISE OPTION FOR MANAGING OA. THE PURPOSE OF THIS FOCUSED REVIEW IS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON OA SYMPTOMS AND PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES. A COMPREHENSIVE SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED USING SEVEN ELECTRONIC DATABASES. TWELVE REPORTS MET INCLUSION CRITERIA INVOLVING A TOTAL OF 589 PARTICIPANTS WITH OA-RELATED SYMPTOMS. A VARIETY OF TYPES, FREQUENCIES, AND DURATIONS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS WERE REPORTED; HATHA AND IYENGAR YOGA WERE THE MOST COMMONLY USED TYPES. FREQUENCY OF INTERVENTION RANGED FROM ONCE A WEEK TO 6 DAYS A WEEK. DURATION OF THE INTERVENTIONS RANGED FROM 45 TO 90 MINS PER SESSION FOR 6 TO 12 WKS. YOGA INTERVENTION RESULTED IN REDUCTIONS IN PAIN, STIFFNESS, AND SWELLING, BUT RESULTS ON PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL-BEING WERE INCONCLUSIVE BECAUSE OF A VARIETY OF OUTCOME MEASURES BEING USED.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
15 1469  31 INNOVATIONS IN THE TREATMENT OF PERINATAL DEPRESSION: THE ROLE OF YOGA AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY INTERVENTIONS DURING PREGNANCY AND POSTPARTUM. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: WE REVIEW EVIDENCE FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND YOGA AS INTERVENTIONS FOR DEPRESSED PREGNANT AND POSTPARTUM WOMEN. RECENT FINDINGS: RESULTS FROM EXISTING TRIALS HAVE GENERALLY INDICATED THAT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND YOGA INTERVENTIONS ARE ACCEPTABLE TO WOMEN DURING THE PERINATAL PERIOD, AND THAT THESE INTERVENTIONS CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING DEPRESSION. HOWEVER, SOME STUDIES HAVE NOT FOUND SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN INTERVENTION AND CONTROL CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, SYMPTOM IMPROVEMENTS WERE NOT ALWAYS MAINTAINED. THE AVAILABLE RESEARCH ON PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND YOGA AS INTERVENTIONS FOR PERINATAL DEPRESSION IS ENCOURAGING WITH REGARD TO FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY, PATIENT SAFETY, AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY. THESE INTERVENTIONS HAVE THE ABILITY TO REACH A LARGE NUMBER OF WOMEN WHO MAY NOT ENGAGE IN TRADITIONAL TREATMENT. ADDITIONAL HIGH QUALITY, RIGOROUS, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS ARE NEEDED. FUTURE RESEARCH IS ALSO NEEDED TO EXAMINE THE OPTIMAL DOSE OF THESE INTERVENTIONS AND HOW TO BEST INCREASE SUSTAINED ENGAGEMENT.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
16 2899  54 [EFFECTS OF PRENATAL YOGA: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS]. OBJECTIVES: WHILE SEVERAL STUDIES ON THE PREVENTIVE AND THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF PRENATAL YOGA (MATERNITY YOGA) HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN NO SYSTEMATIC REVIEW ON THE EFFECTS OF PRENATAL YOGA BASED ON RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCT). THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY, THEREFORE, WAS TO SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEW THE LITERATURE TO CLARIFY THE EFFECTS OF PRENATAL YOGA IN RCT FOCUSING ON THE CONTENTS OF THE INTERVENTION, THE INTERVENTION MEANS, AND THE FREQUENCY OF PRACTICE. METHODS: THE LITERATURE SEARCH WAS PERFORMED USING THE ELECTRONIC DATABASE, PUBMED. THE INCLUSION CRITERIA WERE RCT, PREGNANT WOMEN, AND YOGA INTERVENTION. RESULTS: IN TOTAL, 54 CITATIONS WERE FOUND; OF THESE, EIGHT STUDIES (10 REPORTS) WERE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS. IN FOUR STUDIES ON HEALTHY PREGNANT WOMEN, SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PAIN AND PLEASURE AT DELIVERY, DURATION OF DELIVERY, PERCEIVED STRESS LEVELS DURING PREGNANCY, ANXIETY LEVELS, DEPRESSION, PREGNANCY-RELATED EXPERIENCES, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS WERE COMPARED TO THOSE IN THE CONTROL GROUP. IN TWO STUDIES ON DEPRESSED PREGNANT WOMEN, ONE REPORTED THAT DEPRESSION, ANXIETY LEVELS, ANGER LEVELS, LEG PAIN, AND BACK PAIN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED WITH YOGA, WHILE THE OTHER FOUND NO DIFFERENCES FROM THE CONTROL GROUP. IN ONE STUDY OF HIGH-RISK PREGNANT WOMEN WITH MORBIDITY FACTORS SUCH AS OBESITY OR ADVANCED AGE, YOGA RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER CASES OF PREGNANCY-INDUCED HYPERTENSION, GESTATIONAL DIABETES, AND INTRAUTERINE GROWTH RESTRICTION, AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN PERCEIVED STRESS LEVELS. IN ONE STUDY ON PREGNANT WOMEN WITH PELVIC PAIN, THE MEDIAN PAIN SCORE WAS LOWER IN THE YOGA GROUP. REGARDING THE CONTENTS OF THE INTERVENTION, WHILE THE TWO STUDIES FOR DEPRESSED PREGNANT WOMEN ONLY INCLUDED PHYSICAL POSTURES, THE REMAINING SIX STUDIES ALSO INCLUDED BREATHING TECHNIQUE AND MEDITATION. INTERVENTIONS WERE PERFORMED USING LECTURES BY INSTRUCTORS ALONE OR TOGETHER WITH SELF-TEACHING. THE FREQUENCY OF THE INTERVENTION VARIED WITHIN EACH STUDY. CONCLUSION: THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT PRENATAL YOGA MAY HELP REDUCE PELVIC PAIN. IT MAY ALSO IMPROVE MENTAL CONDITION (STRESS, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, ETC.), PHYSICAL CONDITION (PAIN AND PLEASURE AT THE DELIVERY, ETC.), AND PERINATAL OUTCOMES (OBSTETRICAL COMPLICATIONS, DELIVERY TIME, ETC.). HOWEVER, FURTHER STUDIES ARE NEEDED. THE CONTENTS OF THE INTERVENTION, THE INTERVENTION MEANS, AND THE FREQUENCY VARIED WITH EACH STUDY. THUS, IT IS NECESSARY TO FURTHER EXAMINE THE CONTENT OF EFFECTIVE INTERVENTIONS, INTERVENTION MEANS, AND FREQUENCY THAT SUIT PARTICIPANT'S CHARACTERISTICS AND EACH OUTCOME. FURTHER RESEARCH IN THIS FIELD, PARTICULARLY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS, IS MERITED.	2015	

17 2210  36 THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF YOGA AND EXERCISE: A REVIEW OF COMPARISON STUDIES. OBJECTIVES: EXERCISE IS CONSIDERED AN ACCEPTABLE METHOD FOR IMPROVING AND MAINTAINING PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL HEALTH. A GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE BELIEF THAT YOGA BENEFITS PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH VIA DOWN-REGULATION OF THE HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-ADRENAL (HPA) AXIS AND THE SYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM (SNS). THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO PROVIDE A SCHOLARLY REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE REGARDING RESEARCH STUDIES COMPARING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND EXERCISE ON A VARIETY OF HEALTH OUTCOMES AND HEALTH CONDITIONS. METHODS: USING PUBMED((R)) AND THE KEY WORD "YOGA," A COMPREHENSIVE SEARCH OF THE RESEARCH LITERATURE FROM CORE SCIENTIFIC AND NURSING JOURNALS YIELDED 81 STUDIES THAT MET INCLUSION CRITERIA. THESE STUDIES SUBSEQUENTLY WERE CLASSIFIED AS UNCONTROLLED (N = 30), WAIT LIST CONTROLLED (N = 16), OR COMPARISON (N = 35). THE MOST COMMON COMPARISON INTERVENTION (N = 10) INVOLVED EXERCISE. THESE STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW. RESULTS: IN THE STUDIES REVIEWED, YOGA INTERVENTIONS APPEARED TO BE EQUAL OR SUPERIOR TO EXERCISE IN NEARLY EVERY OUTCOME MEASURED EXCEPT THOSE INVOLVING PHYSICAL FITNESS. CONCLUSIONS: THE STUDIES COMPARING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND EXERCISE SEEM TO INDICATE THAT, IN BOTH HEALTHY AND DISEASED POPULATIONS, YOGA MAY BE AS EFFECTIVE AS OR BETTER THAN EXERCISE AT IMPROVING A VARIETY OF HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOME MEASURES. FUTURE CLINICAL TRIALS ARE NEEDED TO EXAMINE THE DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN EXERCISE AND YOGA, PARTICULARLY HOW THE TWO MODALITIES MAY DIFFER IN THEIR EFFECTS ON THE SNS/HPA AXIS. ADDITIONAL STUDIES USING RIGOROUS METHODOLOGIES ARE NEEDED TO EXAMINE THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF THE VARIOUS TYPES OF YOGA.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
18 1218  30 EXPLORING THE THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF YOGA AND ITS ABILITY TO INCREASE QUALITY OF LIFE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO ASSESS THE FINDINGS OF SELECTED ARTICLES REGARDING THE THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF YOGA AND TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE BENEFITS OF REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE. AS PARTICIPATION RATES IN MIND-BODY FITNESS PROGRAMS SUCH AS YOGA CONTINUE TO INCREASE, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS TO BE INFORMED ABOUT THE NATURE OF YOGA AND THE EVIDENCE OF ITS MANY THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS. THUS, THIS MANUSCRIPT PROVIDES INFORMATION REGARDING THE THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF YOGA AS IT HAS BEEN STUDIED IN VARIOUS POPULATIONS CONCERNING A MULTITUDE OF DIFFERENT AILMENTS AND CONDITIONS. THERAPEUTIC YOGA IS DEFINED AS THE APPLICATION OF YOGA POSTURES AND PRACTICE TO THE TREATMENT OF HEALTH CONDITIONS AND INVOLVES INSTRUCTION IN YOGIC PRACTICES AND TEACHINGS TO PREVENT REDUCE OR ALLEVIATE STRUCTURAL, PHYSIOLOGICAL, EMOTIONAL AND SPIRITUAL PAIN, SUFFERING OR LIMITATIONS. RESULTS FROM THIS STUDY SHOW THAT YOGIC PRACTICES ENHANCE MUSCULAR STRENGTH AND BODY FLEXIBILITY, PROMOTE AND IMPROVE RESPIRATORY AND CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTION, PROMOTE RECOVERY FROM AND TREATMENT OF ADDICTION, REDUCE STRESS, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND CHRONIC PAIN, IMPROVE SLEEP PATTERNS, AND ENHANCE OVERALL WELL-BEING AND QUALITY OF LIFE.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
19  233  29 A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF YOGA FOR STATE ANXIETY: CONSIDERATIONS FOR OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY. BACKGROUND: STATE ANXIETY CAN RESULT FROM A VARIETY OF LIFE SITUATIONS. THIS TYPE OF ANXIETY CAN DISRUPT OCCUPATIONAL ENGAGEMENT AND PERFORMANCE, THEREBY AFFECTING REHABILITATION AND RECOVERY. OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS NEED TO ADDRESS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN MIND-BODY-SPIRIT AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO PERFORMANCE AND ENGAGEMENT IN MEANINGFUL OCCUPATIONS. YOGA, WHEN USED AS AN ADJUNCT TO THERAPY, HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ADDRESS STATE ANXIETY. PURPOSE: THE AIM WAS TO SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEW THE EVIDENCE CONCERNING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AS A TREATMENT APPROACH FOR STATE ANXIETY. METHODS: SIX ELECTRONIC DATABASES, THE AUTHORS' OWN FILES, AND THE REFERENCES OF INCLUDED STUDIES FROM 1990 TO JULY 2011 WERE SEARCHED. FINDINGS: A TOTAL OF 25 UNIQUE STUDIES REPRESENTED BY 26 PUBLICATIONS MADE UP THE SAMPLE: TWO SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS; 16 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS, AND SEVEN PROSPECTIVE, CONTROLLED, NON-RANDOMIZED STUDIES. EVIDENCE SUGGESTS YOGA CAN BE A VIABLE THERAPEUTIC OPTION FOR REDUCING STATE ANXIETY IN CERTAIN SITUATIONS. IMPLICATIONS: IN MAKING THE DETERMINATION TO RECOMMEND YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION, OCCUPATIONAL THERAPISTS SHOULD CONSIDER THE CLIENT'S CIRCUMSTANCES AND VALUES AS WELL AS THE TYPE AND INTENSITY OF THE YOGA PROGRAM.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
20 2848  42 YOGA, MEDITATION AND MINDFULNESS IN PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY - A REVIEW OF LITERATURE. PURPOSE: CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS UNDERGOING TREATMENT FOR CANCER ARE EXPOSED TO A WIDE VARIETY OF STRESSORS BOTH PHYSICAL AND MENTAL. NOT ONLY ADULTS BUT ALSO CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS INCREASINGLY PRACTICE YOGA IN A HEALTH-PROMOTING MANNER AND TO COPE WITH STRESSFUL SITUATIONS. METHODS: A REVIEW OF LITERATURE WAS CONDUCTED TO PRESENT THE CURRENT OUTCOMES ON YOGA, MEDITATION AND MINDFULNESS FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WHO ARE AFFECTED BY AN ONCOLOGICAL DISEASE. RESULTS: EIGHT STUDIES WERE IDENTIFIED THAT EXAMINED YOGA TREATMENT FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH ONCOLOGICAL DISEASES. THREE STUDIES WERE FOUND ON MINDFULNESS IN PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY. THE STUDIES SUMMARIZED HERE SUGGEST THAT YOGA AND MINDFULNESS COULD HELP TO IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE, REDUCE FATIGUE, IMPROVE ACTIVITY AND FITNESS LEVELS, IMPROVE SLEEP QUALITY, INCREASE APPETITE AND DECREASE ANXIETY IN VARIOUS STAGES OF THE DISEASE AND ITS TREATMENT. THE REVIEWED STUDIES SHOWED THAT YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH ONCOLOGICAL ILLNESSES ARE FEASIBLE IN DIFFERENT SETTINGS AND ARE WELL RECEIVED. CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS OF THE STUDIES SUGGEST THAT YOGA AND MINDFULNESS MAY HELP TO SUPPORT CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS DURING AND AFTER ONCOLOGICAL TREATMENT. BASED ON THE CURRENT BODY OF EVIDENCE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE EFFICACY OF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS IN PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY PATIENTS. RESEARCH MUST MEET THIS CHALLENGE TO DEVELOP SUITABLE DESIGNS TO FURTHER AND BETTER INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH ONCOLOGICAL DISEASES.	2021

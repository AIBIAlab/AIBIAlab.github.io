1 1414 152 IMPLEMENTING YOGA THERAPY ADAPTED FOR OLDER VETERANS WHO ARE CANCER SURVIVORS. OBJECTIVES: THIS GOAL OF THIS PAPER IS TO DESCRIBE THE REACH, APPLICATION, AND EFFECTIVENESS OF AN 8-WEEK YOGA THERAPY PROTOCOL WITH OLDER CANCER SURVIVORS WITHIN A VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION SETTING. METHODS: TO DOCUMENT THE REACH OF THIS INTERVENTION, RECRUITMENT EFFORTS, ATTENDANCE, AND PRACTICE RATES WERE TRACKED. TO EXPLORE THE APPLICATION OF THE PROTOCOL TO THIS POPULATION, PHYSICAL THERAPY PRE-ASSESSMENT AND OBSERVATIONS BY THE YOGA THERAPIST WERE RECORDED TO ASCERTAIN NECESSARY POSE MODIFICATIONS. EFFECTIVENESS WAS MEASURED THROUGH PRE- AND POST-COURSE STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS, TRACKING SELF-REPORTED SYMPTOMS OF COMBAT-RELATED POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, FATIGUE, INSOMNIA, AND PAIN. RESULTS: REGARDING REACH, 15% OF ELIGIBLE VETERANS (N = 14) ENROLLED, PARTICIPATED IN 3-16 CLASSES (M+/-SD = 11.64+/-3.39), AND PRACTICED AT HOME FOR 0-56 DAYS (M+/-SD = 26.36+/-17.87). PARTICIPANTS WERE PRIMARILY CAUCASIAN (N = 13), MALE (N = 13), RANGED IN AGE FROM 55 TO 78 YEARS (M+/-SD = 65.64+/-5.15), AND HAD MULTIPLE MEDICAL PROBLEMS. DURING APPLICATION, SUBSTANTIAL INDIVIDUALIZED MODIFICATIONS TO THE YOGA THERAPY PROTOCOL WERE NECESSARY. EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERVENTION WAS MIXED. DURING POST-COURSE INTERVIEWS, PARTICIPANTS REPORTED A VARIETY OF QUALITATIVE BENEFITS. NOTABLY, THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS REPORTED THAT BREATHING AND RELAXATION TECHNIQUES WERE THE MOST USEFUL TO LEARN. GROUP COMPARISONS OF MEAN PRE- AND POST-COURSE SCORES ON STANDARDIZED MEASURES SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES. CONCLUSIONS: A MINORITY OF OLDER VETERANS EXPRESS AN INTEREST IN YOGA, BUT THOSE WHO DO HAVE HIGH RATES OF CLASS ATTENDANCE AND HOME PRACTICE. CAREFUL PHYSICAL PRE-ASSESSMENT AND ATTENTIVE THERAPISTS ARE REQUIRED TO UNDERTAKE THE ADAPTATIONS REQUIRED BY PARTICIPANTS WITH MULTIPLE COMORBIDITIES. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN THIS SETTING REQUIRES ADDITIONAL STUDY.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
2 1830  34 PSYCHOLOGICAL FLEXIBILITY AND SET-SHIFTING AMONG VETERANS PARTICIPATING IN A YOGA PROGRAM: A PILOT STUDY. INTRODUCTION: TRAUMA-FOCUSED PSYCHOTHERAPIES DO NOT MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL VETERANS. YOGA SHOWS SOME POTENTIAL IN REDUCING STRESS AND PERHAPS EVEN PTSD IN VETERANS, ALTHOUGH LITTLE IS UNDERSTOOD ABOUT THE MECHANISMS OF ACTION. THIS STUDY IDENTIFIES PRELIMINARY CORRELATES OF CHANGE IN PTSD AND PERCEIVED STRESS FOR VETERANS PARTICIPATING IN YOGA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: NINE VETERANS (SEVEN MALES AND TWO FEMALES) WERE RECRUITED FROM AN EXISTING CLINICAL YOGA PROGRAM AND OBSERVED OVER 16 WK. SEVERITY OF PTSD SYMPTOMS (PCL-5) AND PERCEIVED STRESS (PSS-10) WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE AND WEEKS 4, 6, 8, AND 16. PSYCHOLOGICAL FLEXIBILITY (AAQ-II) AND SET-SHIFTING (RATIO OF TRAIL MAKING TEST A TO B) WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE AND AT WEEK 6. SUBJECTS ATTENDED YOGA SESSIONS FREELY, RANGING FROM 1 TO 23 CLASSES OVER THE 16 WEEKS. THE STANFORD UNIVERSITY INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD APPROVED THIS RESEARCH PROTOCOL. RESULTS: SELF-REPORTED PTSD SYMPTOMS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED WHILE PERCEIVED STRESS DID NOT. LOWER BASELINE SET-SHIFTING PREDICTED GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN PTSD BETWEEN BASELINE AND 4 WEEKS; EARLY IMPROVEMENTS IN SET-SHIFTING PREDICTED OVERALL REDUCTION IN PTSD. GREATER PSYCHOLOGICAL FLEXIBILITY WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER PTSD AND PERCEIVED STRESS; MORE YOGA PRACTICE, BEFORE AND DURING THE STUDY, WAS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER PSYCHOLOGICAL FLEXIBILITY. OTHER PREDICTORS WERE NOT SUPPORTED. CONCLUSIONS: IN A SMALL UNCONTROLLED SAMPLE, PSYCHOLOGICAL FLEXIBILITY AND SET-SHIFTING PREDICTED CHANGES IN PTSD SYMPTOMS IN VETERANS PARTICIPATING IN A CLINICAL YOGA PROGRAM, WHICH SUPPORTS FINDINGS FROM PRIOR RESEARCH. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD INCLUDE AN ACTIVE COMPARISON GROUP AND RECORD FREQUENCY OF YOGA PRACTICED OUTSIDE FORMAL SESSIONS.	2018

4 1230  42 FEASIBILITY AND OUTCOME OF AN ONLINE STREAMED YOGA INTERVENTION ON STRESS AND WELLBEING OF PEOPLE WORKING FROM HOME DURING COVID-19. BACKGROUND: THE OUTBREAK OF COVID-19 AND ITS ASSOCIATED MEASURES HAS RESULTED IN A SIZEABLE WORKING POPULATION TRANSITIONING TO WORKING FROM HOME (WFH), BRINGING ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES, AND INCREASING WORK-RELATED STRESS. RESEARCH HAS INDICATED THAT YOGA HAS PROMISING POTENTIAL IN REDUCING STRESS IN THE WORKPLACE. HOWEVER, THERE ARE VERY FEW STUDIES EXPLORING THE IMPACT OF ONLINE STREAMED YOGA ON STRESS MANAGEMENT FOR PEOPLE-WFH. OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY AND OUTCOME OF AN ONLINE STREAMED YOGA INTERVENTION ON STRESS AND WELLBEING OF PEOPLE-WFH DURING COVID-19. METHODS: A SIX-WEEK PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) YOGA INTERVENTION WAS DESIGNED WITH YOGA (N = 26) AND A WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 26). A MIXED TWO-WAY ANOVA WAS USED TO ASSESS CHANGES IN STANDARDISED OUTCOME MEASURES AT BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION. LIKERT AND OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS ASSESSED ENJOYMENT, ACCEPTABILITY AND PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF THE PROGRAM, WHICH WERE ANALYSED THEMATICALLY. RESULTS: COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL, THE YOGA GROUP REPORTED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN PERCEIVED STRESS, MENTAL WELLBEING, DEPRESSION AND COPING SELF-EFFICACY, BUT NOT STRESS AND ANXIETY. PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCED PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS AND REPORTED HIGH ACCEPTABILITY AND ENJOYMENT OF THE INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: AN ONLINE YOGA INTERVENTION CAN HELP PEOPLE WFH MANAGE STRESS AND ENHANCE WELLBEING AND COPING ABILITIES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
5 1892  42 RELAX WHILE YOU REHABILITATE: A PILOT STUDY INTEGRATING A NOVEL, YOGA-BASED MINDFULNESS GROUP INTERVENTION INTO A RESIDENTIAL MILITARY BRAIN INJURY REHABILITATION PROGRAM. OBJECTIVE: THIS PRELIMINARY, PILOT STUDY ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A GROUP-BASED, MINDFULNESS INTERVENTION IN A RESIDENTIAL, REHABILITATION SETTING WITH SPECIFIC FOCUS ON ASSESSING PARTICIPANTS' SELF-REPORT OF PERCEIVED BENEFIT OF THE INTERVENTION ON OVERALL HEALTH, PAIN, SLEEP, MOOD/ANXIETY, ATTENTION, AND SELF-AWARENESS, AS WELL AS IMPLEMENTING MODIFICATIONS NEEDED FOR SUCCESSFUL INTERVENTION APPLICATION AMONG A DIVERSE, CLINICAL MILITARY POPULATION. METHOD/DESIGN: PARTICIPANTS WERE 19 VETERANS AND ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBERS WITH A HISTORY OF TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI; 63% SEVERE) WHO COMPLETED A MINDFULNESS-BASED GROUP INTERVENTION DURING INPATIENT ADMISSION AT A VETERANS AFFAIRS POLYTRAUMA TRANSITIONAL REHABILITATION PROGRAM (PTRP). MINDFULNESS AND YOGA SKILLS WERE TAUGHT IN A REQUIRED, WEEKLY GROUP INCORPORATED INTO PARTICIPANTS' REHABILITATION SCHEDULE. OPINIONS AND ATTITUDES ABOUT MINDFULNESS, AS WELL AS PERTINENT SELF-REPORT OUTCOME MEASURES, WERE OBTAINED PRE- AND POSTGROUP PARTICIPATION. RESULTS: RESULTS SUGGESTED THAT PARTICIPATION IN THE GROUP WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH INDIVIDUALS' SELF-REPORTED BELIEF ABOUT THE BENEFIT OF MINDFULNESS IN THE AREAS OF OVERALL HEALTH, PHYSICAL HEALTH, MOOD, FOCUS, AND SELF-AWARENESS. THE MORE GROUPS ATTENDED, THE MORE POSITIVE THE PARTICIPANTS' BELIEFS ABOUT POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OVERALL HEALTH AND MOOD BECAME, EVEN WHILE CONTROLLING FOR LENGTH OF REHABILITATION STAY. ADDITIONALLY, SEVERAL SPECIFIC GROUP MODIFICATIONS RELEVANT TO THIS POPULATION (E.G., PHYSICAL/ENVIRONMENTAL MODIFICATIONS, REPETITION, IGNORING/REORIENTING) WERE IMPLEMENTED TO SUPPORT SUCCESSFUL PARTICIPATION. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: THESE PRELIMINARY AND EXPLORATORY FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT IT MAY BE WORTHWHILE FOR PSYCHOLOGISTS, CLINICIANS, AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WORKING WITH A MIXED TBI POPULATION, AND MORE SPECIFICALLY A MILITARY POPULATION WITH TBI, TO CONSIDER INTRODUCING MINDFULNESS SKILLS AS PART OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY REHABILITATION.

6 2579  31 YOGA FOR HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN ADULT CANCER: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED FEASIBILITY STUDY. AN INCREASE IN PATIENT-LED UPTAKE OF COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES IN ADULT CANCER HAS LED TO A NEED FOR MORE RIGOROUS STUDY OF SUCH INTERVENTIONS AND THEIR OUTCOMES. THIS STUDY THEREFORE AIMED TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF A YOGA INTERVENTION IN MEN AND WOMEN RECEIVING CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT FOR A CANCER DIAGNOSIS. PROSPECTIVE, MIXED METHODS FEASIBILITY TRIAL ALLOCATED PARTICIPANTS TO RECEIVE ONE OF THREE YOGA INTERVENTIONS OVER A FOUR-WEEK STUDY PERIOD. DATA COLLECTION WAS COMPLETED THROUGH ONLINE SURVEY OF QOL-CA/CS AND CUSTOMIZED SURVEYS. FIFTEEN PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED (11 FEMALE) UNDERGOING TREATMENT FOR BREAST, PROSTATE, COLORECTAL, BRAIN, AND BLOOD AND LUNG CANCER. TWO PARTICIPANTS DROPPED OUT AND COMPLETE QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DATA SETS WERE COLLECTED FROM 12 PARTICIPANTS AND FOUR YOGA INSTRUCTORS. OTHER OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED IMPLEMENTATION COSTS PATIENT-REPORTED PREFERENCES FOR YOGA INTERVENTION AND CHANGES IN QOL-CA/CS. THREE TYPES OF YOGA INTERVENTION WERE SAFELY ADMINISTERED IN ADULT CANCER. MIXED METHODS, COST-EFFICIENCY, QOL-CA/CS, AND EVIDENCE-BASED DESIGN OF YOGA INTERVENTION HAVE BEEN USED TO ESTABLISH FEASIBILITY AND PATIENT-PREFERENCES FOR YOGA DELIVERY IN ADULT CANER. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT, WITH SOME METHODOLOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS, A LARGE-SCALE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IS WARRANTED TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR MALE AND FEMALE CANCER PATIENTS. THIS TRIAL IS REGISTERED WITH CLINICALTRIALS.GOV NCT02309112.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
7 1753  35 PILOTING YOGA AND ASSESSING OUTCOMES IN A RESIDENTIAL BEHAVIOURAL HEALTH UNIT. THIS STUDY EXAMINED IF ADOLESCENTS ON A RESIDENTIAL BEHAVIOURAL HEALTH UNIT WOULD PARTICIPATE IN A YOGA INTERVENTION. YOGA HAS BEEN USED AS A MIND-BODY PRACTICE FOR MORE THAN 2000 YEARS; HOWEVER, STUDIES ARE LIMITED REGARDING ITS EFFECTS ON ADOLESCENTS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS ON AN INPATIENT UNIT. YOGA WAS ADDED, TWICE WEEKLY, TO THE PROGRAM SCHEDULE. TRAIT EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE QUESTIONNAIRE-ADOLESCENT SHORT FORM (TEIQUE-ASF) SCORES WERE MEASURED OVER 8 WEEKS. ADDITIONAL MEASURES INCLUDED DAILY NUMBERS OF QUIET TIMES, TIME OUTS, AND POINT CARD SCORES. TWENTY-TWO ADOLESCENTS COMPLETED THE STUDY. THE TEIQUE-ASF ASSESSMENT WAS ABLE TO DETECT CHANGES IN TOTAL SCORES OVER 8 WEEKS. INCREASED YOGA PARTICIPATION WAS RELATED TO HIGHER VALUES OF THE TEIQUE-ASF SUBDOMAIN OF SOCIABILITY, INCREASE IN WEEKLY POINT CARD TOTALS, A DECREASE IN BEHAVIOURAL TIME OUTS, AND A DECREASE IN COMBINED BEHAVIOURAL INTERVENTIONS AT VARIOUS TIME POINTS THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAMME. THIS STUDY WAS RELEVANT BECAUSE IT WAS CONDUCTED ON AN ADOLESCENT INPATIENT UNIT. IT PROVIDES SUPPORT THAT YOGA, AS PART OF A RESIDENTIAL PROGRAMME, IS A FEASIBLE INTERVENTION FOR ADOLESCENTS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. CHANGES IN THE VARIOUS MEASURES CANNOT BE DIRECTLY LINKED TO YOGA BECAUSE OF LACK OF A COMPARISON GROUP. ADDITIONAL STUDIES WITH A LARGER SAMPLE, AND RANDOMIZATION, ARE NEEDED TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA AND TO DETERMINE IF CHANGES TO THE TEIQUE-ASF CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO YOGA OR OTHER BEHAVIOURAL-BASED INTERVENTIONS. LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW YOGA WILL IMPACT BEHAVIOURAL HEALTH OUTCOMES FOR ADOLESCENTS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS IN AN INPATIENT SETTING. THIS STUDY EXAMINED IF ADOLESCENTS ON A RESIDENTIAL BEHAVIOURAL HEALTH UNIT WOULD PARTICIPATE IN A YOGA INTERVENTION TO ADDRESS EMOTIONAL REGULATION. A SINGLE COHORT STUDY DESIGN WAS USED. YOGA WAS ADDED TO THE PROGRAMME SCHEDULE TWICE WEEKLY. TRAIT EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE QUESTIONNAIRE-ADOLESCENT SHORT FORM (TEIQUE-ASF) SCORES AND ADDITIONAL BEHAVIOURAL MEASURES WERE TRACKED OVER 8 WEEKS. ADOLESCENTS PARTICIPATED IN YOGA, WITH A HIGHER PARTICIPATION RATE FOR GIRLS COMPARED WITH BOYS. THE TEIQUE-ASF ASSESSMENT DETECTED CHANGES IN TOTAL SCORE OVER 8 WEEKS. INCREASED YOGA PARTICIPATION WAS RELATED TO HIGHER VALUES OF THE TEIQUE-ASF SUBDOMAIN OF SOCIABILITY, INCREASE IN WEEKLY POINT CARD TOTALS, AND A DECREASE IN COMBINED BEHAVIOURAL INTERVENTIONS AT VARIOUS TIME POINTS THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAMME. THIS STUDY WAS RELEVANT BECAUSE IT WAS CONDUCTED ON AN ADOLESCENT INPATIENT UNIT. FURTHER STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO DETERMINE IF CHANGES CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO YOGA OR OTHER BEHAVIOURAL-BASED INTERVENTIONS. IF SUPPORTED BY FURTHER STUDIES, YOGA HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE A COMPLIMENTARY THERAPY THAT CAN BE INTEGRATED INTO THE MULTIDISCIPLINARY TREATMENT APPROACH FOR MENTAL HEALTH PATIENTS.	2015	

8 2495  25 YOGA AS PALLIATION IN WOMEN WITH ADVANCED CANCER: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE PALLIATIVE POTENTIAL OF HOME-BASED YOGA SESSIONS PROVIDED TO WOMEN WITH ADVANCED CANCER. METHOD: PERSONALISED 45-MINUTE YOGA SESSIONS WERE OFFERED TO THREE WOMEN WITH ADVANCED CANCER BY AN EXPERIENCED YOGA TEACHER. EACH WOMAN TOOK PART IN A ONE-TO-ONE INTERVIEW AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE YOGA PROGRAMME AND WAS ASKED TO DESCRIBE HER EXPERIENCES OF THE PROGRAMME'S IMPACT. RESULTS: THE PERSONALISED NATURE OF THE YOGA SESSIONS RESULTED IN SIMILAR POSITIVE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL EFFECTS COMPARABLE TO THOSE DEMONSTRATED IN OTHER STUDIES WITH CANCER PATIENTS. PARTICIPANTS DESCRIBED PHYSICAL, MENTAL, AND EMOTIONAL BENEFITS AS WELL AS THE ALLEVIATION OF ILLNESS IMPACTS. THE ENHANCEMENT OF MIND-BODY AND BODY-SPIRIT CONNECTIONS WERE ALSO NOTED. CONCLUSION: PERSONALISED HOME-BASED YOGA PROGRAMMES FOR PEOPLE WITH ADVANCED CANCER MAY PRODUCE SIMILAR BENEFITS, INCLUDING PALLIATION, AS THOSE INSTITUTIONALLY-BASED PROGRAMMES FOR PEOPLE WITH NON-ADVANCED CANCER.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
9   28  50 'JOINING A GROUP WAS INSPIRING': A QUALITATIVE STUDY OF SERVICE USERS' EXPERIENCES OF YOGA ON SOCIAL PRESCRIPTION. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS BECOMING AN INCREASINGLY POPULAR HOLISTIC APPROACH IN THE WEST TO MANAGE LONG-TERM HEALTH CONDITIONS. THIS STUDY PRESENTS THE EVALUATION OF A PILOT YOGA INTERVENTION, YOGA4HEALTH, THAT WAS DEVELOPED FOR THE NHS TO BE SOCIALLY PRESCRIBED TO PATIENTS AT RISK OF DEVELOPING SPECIFIC HEALTH CONDITIONS (RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, PRE-DIABETES, ANXIETY/DEPRESSION OR EXPERIENCING SOCIAL ISOLATION). THE AIM OF THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY WAS TO EXPLORE SERVICE USERS' EXPERIENCES OF YOGA4HEALTH AND THE ACCEPTABILITY OF THE PROGRAMME. METHODS: QUALITATIVE DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM THREE SOURCES: 1. OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS ON QUESTIONNAIRES COMPLETED BY SERVICES USERS AT THREE DIFFERENT TIME-POINTS (BASELINE, POST INTERVENTION AND 3 MONTHS); 2. INTERVIEWS AND FOCUS GROUPS WITH A SUBSET OF PARTICIPANTS (N = 22); 3. INTERVIEWS WITH YOGA TEACHERS DELIVERING YOGA4HEALTH (N = 7). EACH DATA SOURCE WAS ANALYSED THEMATICALLY, THEN FINDINGS WERE COMBINED. RESULTS: OF PARTICIPANTS COMPLETING BASELINE QUESTIONNAIRES (N = 240), 82.5% WERE FEMALE, 50% WHITE, WITH A MEAN AGE OF 53 (RANGE 23-82) YEARS. BASELINE QUESTIONNAIRES REVEALED KEY MOTIVATIONS TO ATTEND YOGA4HEALTH WERE TO IMPROVE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH, AND BELIEVING YOGA4HEALTH WOULD BE ACCESSIBLE FOR PEOPLE WITH THEIR HEALTH CONDITION. POST-INTERVENTION, PARTICIPANTS REPORTED A RANGE OF BENEFITS ACROSS PSYCHOLOGICAL, PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL DOMAINS FROM YOGA4HEALTH. INCREASED CONFIDENCE IN SELF-MANAGEMENT OF HEALTH WAS ALSO REPORTED, AND A NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS DESCRIBED MAKING POSITIVE LIFESTYLE CHANGES AFTER ATTENDING THE PROGRAMME. UNANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF YOGA EMERGED FOR PARTICIPANTS, SUCH AS ENJOYMENT AND SOCIAL CONNECTEDNESS, WHICH FACILITATED ONGOING ATTENDANCE AND PRACTICE. ALSO KEY TO FACILITATING PRACTICE (DURING AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION) WERE SUITABILITY OF THE CLASSES FOR THOSE WITH HEALTH CONDITIONS, PRACTISING WITH A GROUP AND QUALITIES OF THE YOGA TEACHER. HOME PRACTICE WAS SUPPORTED BY COURSE MATERIALS (MANUAL, VIDEOS), AS WELL AS THE TEACHING OF TECHNIQUES FOR EVERYDAY APPLICATION THAT OFFERED IMMEDIATE BENEFITS, SUCH AS BREATHING PRACTICES. FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONNAIRES REVEALED A KEY CHALLENGE WAS CONTINUATION OF PRACTICE ONCE THE INTERVENTION HAD FINISHED, WITH THE STRUCTURE OF A CLASS IMPORTANT IN SUPPORTING PRACTICE. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA4HEALTH WAS A HIGHLY ACCEPTABLE INTERVENTION TO SERVICES USERS, WHICH BROUGHT A RANGE OF BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL IMPROVEMENTS, SUGGESTING YOGA IS AN APPROPRIATE INTERVENTION TO OFFER ON SOCIAL PRESCRIPTION.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
10 1512  33 IS THERE MORE TO YOGA THAN EXERCISE? CONTEXT: YOGA IS INCREASING IN POPULARITY, WITH AN ESTIMATED 15 MILLION PRACTITIONERS IN THE UNITED STATES, YET THERE IS A DEARTH OF EMPIRICAL DATA ADDRESSING THE HOLISTIC BENEFITS OF YOGA. OBJECTIVE: TO COMPARE THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL BENEFITS OF AN EXERCISE-BASED YOGA PRACTICE TO THAT OF A MORE COMPREHENSIVE YOGA PRACTICE (ONE WITH AN ETHICAL/SPIRITUAL COMPONENT). DESIGN: STUDENTS WITH MILD TO MODERATE DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, OR STRESS AND WHO AGREED TO PARTICIPATE WERE ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THREE GROUPS: INTEGRATED YOGA, YOGA AS EXERCISE, CONTROL. PARTICIPANTS: A TOTAL OF 81 UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS 18 YEARS AND OLDER AT A UNIVERSITY IN THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, STRESS, HOPE, AND SALIVARY CORTISOL. RESULTS: OVER TIME, PARTICIPANTS IN BOTH THE INTEGRATED AND EXERCISE YOGA GROUPS EXPERIENCED DECREASED DEPRESSION AND STRESS, AN INCREASED SENSE OF HOPEFULNESS, AND INCREASED FLEXIBILITY COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. HOWEVER, ONLY THE INTEGRATED YOGA GROUP EXPERIENCED DECREASED ANXIETY-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND DECREASED SALIVARY CORTISOL FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END OF THE STUDY. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA, PRACTICED IN A MORE INTEGRATED FORM, IE, WITH AN ETHICAL AND SPIRITUAL COMPONENT, MAY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS OVER YOGA PRACTICED AS AN EXERCISE REGIMEN.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
11  386  32 BENEFITS AND ADVERSE EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA PRACTICE: A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY FROM INDIA. OBJECTIVE: BENEFITS AND ADVERSE EFFECTS OF YOGA WERE REPORTED IN SURVEYS FROM DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO (I) DETERMINE THE BENEFITS AND ADVERSE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN YOGA EXPERIENCED PERSONS IN INDIA AND (II) CORRELATE THESE EFFECTS OF YOGA WITH FACTORS RELATED TO THE INDIVIDUAL AND THEIR YOGA PRACTICE. DESIGN AND SETTING: THIS CONVENIENCE SAMPLING IN-PERSON SURVEY REPORTS BENEFITS AND ADVERSE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN 3135 YOGA EXPERIENCED PERSONS. RESULTS: THE BENEFITS OF YOGA WERE REPORTED BY 94.5 PERCENT OF THE RESPONDENTS. THE THREE MOST COMMON BENEFITS WERE IMPROVEMENT IN: (I) PHYSICAL FITNESS, (II) MENTAL STATE AND (III) COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS. AN ADVERSE EFFECT OF YOGA WAS REPORTED BY 1.9 PERCENT OF THE RESPONDENTS. THE THREE MOST COMMON ADVERSE EFFECTS REPORTED WERE: (I) SORENESS AND PAIN, (II) MUSCLE INJURIES AND (III) FATIGUE. THE FOLLOWING FACTORS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION (IN ALL CASES P < 0.05 CHI SQUARE TEST; CRAMER'S V > 0.10) WITH REPORTED BENEFITS OF YOGA: (I) EXPERIENCE OF YOGA IN MONTHS, (II) TIME SPENT PRACTICING YOGA IN A WEEK, (III) NUMBER OF YOGA TECHNIQUES PRACTICED, AND (IV) WHETHER AWARENESS WAS MAINTAINED DURING THE YOGA PRACTICE OR NOT. CONCLUSION: BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE TO PHYSICAL HEALTH WERE THE MOST COMMON, WITH SORENESS AND PAIN THE MOST COMMON ADVERSE EFFECT OF YOGA. YOGA PRACTICE RELATED FACTORS INFLUENCE THE BENEFITS OF YOGA.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
12 1998  45 STRENGTH AND AWARENESS IN ACTION: FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION FOR POST-ACUTE MILD TBI HEADACHES AMONG VETERANS. BACKGROUND: MILD TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (MTBI) IS A SIGNATURE INJURY SUSTAINED BY VETERANS DURING RECENT CONFLICTS. FOR SOME, MTBI/CONCUSSION IS ASSOCIATED WITH DISABLING SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING POST-CONCUSSIVE HEADACHES (PCH). HOWEVER, THERE ARE LIMITED EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENTS FOR PERSISTENT PCH. OBJECTIVE: INVESTIGATORS ASSESSED THE FEASIBILITY OF DESIGN ELEMENTS OF A YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONAL TRIAL FOR PCH AMONG VETERANS, AS WELL AS THE ACCEPTABILITY OF THE INTERVENTION. METHODS: THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY TRIAL WAS IMPLEMENTED USING A WAITLIST-CONTROL DESIGN. DESIGN ELEMENTS OF INTEREST INCLUDED: AN EXERCISE RUN-IN CLASS; RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION STRATEGIES; AND, ECOLOGICAL MOMENTARY ASSESSMENT (EMA) MODALITIES TO TRACK HEADACHES AND YOGA PRACTICE. VETERAN SATISFACTION REGARDING THE INTERVENTION WAS ALSO EVALUATED. A DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED ON CANDIDATE OUTCOMES INCLUDING PCH, POST-CONCUSSIVE SYMPTOMS, PAIN, AND DAILY FUNCTIONING. RESULTS: TWENTY-SEVEN PARTICIPANTS (OUT OF 70 CONSENTED AND ELIGIBLE AFTER STUDY VISIT 1) COMPLETED EACH EVALUATION TIMEPOINT AND REGULARLY ATTENDED YOGA SESSIONS, WITH 89% OF THESE VETERANS REPORTING MODERATE TO HIGH LEVELS OF SATISFACTION WITH THE INTERVENTION AT STUDY COMPLETION. QUALITATIVELY, PARTICIPANTS ENDORSED IMPROVEMENTS IN HEADACHES, CHRONIC PAIN, AND MOOD. FEASIBILITY RESULTS WERE MIXED. INITIAL FEASIBILITY CRITERION REGARDING YOGA ATTENDANCE WAS NOT MET; HOWEVER, MODIFICATIONS, SUCH AS EXPANSION TO AN ADDITIONAL CLINIC SITE AND REDUCTION OF IN-PERSON YOGA SESSIONS WITH INCREASED ENCOURAGEMENT TO USE STUDY-CREATED ONLINE YOGA VIDEOS IMPROVED FEASIBILITY OF THE STUDY DESIGN. PARTICIPANTS MOST FREQUENTLY USED MOBILE AND WEB-BASED EMA MODALITIES TO TRACK YOGA PRACTICE. CONCLUSIONS: ALTHOUGH CHALLENGES WITH FEASIBILITY OF THE STUDY DESIGN ELEMENTS WERE NOTED, RESULTS SUGGESTED ACCEPTABILITY OF THE YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION FOR VETERANS WITH PERSISTENT PCH. ADDITIONAL EXPLORATION REGARDING THE FREQUENCY AND MODALITY OF YOGA DELIVERY (E.G., IN-PERSON, TELEHEALTH) IS WARRANTED. IMPACT: VETERANS FOUND THE YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION ACCEPTABLE, HOWEVER EXPLORATION OF NOVEL MODALITIES OF INTERVENTION DELIVERY WILL LIKELY BE NECESSARY TO ENHANCE THE FEASIBILITY OF INTERVENTION IMPLEMENTATION DURING FUTURE TRIALS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
13 2645  31 YOGA FOR YOUNG ADULTS WITH NONCURATIVE CANCER: A BRIEF REPORT. BACKGROUND: THE PRACTICE OF YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE DISEASE- AND TREATMENT-RELATED SIDE EFFECTS IN THE NONCURATIVE CANCER PATIENT. OBJECTIVE: THIS USER EXPERIENCE STUDY AIMED TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND USEFULNESS OF A DVD-BASED YOGA PROGRAM FOR YOUNG ADULT CANCER PATIENTS WITH A NONCURATIVE DIAGNOSIS. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO PARTAKE IN A 7-WEEK DVD-BASED YOGA PROGRAM AND COMPLETE MEASURES OF PROGRAM USE AND USEFULNESS. RESULTS: NINE PATIENTS EXPRESSED STUDY INTEREST AND 5 CONSENTED TO PARTICIPATE. FOUR COMPLETED THE FULL STUDY PROTOCOL. PARTICIPANTS REPORTED BEING SATISFIED WITH THE PROGRAM AND DESCRIBED THAT IT PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SELF-CARE. IMPROVEMENTS IN FUNCTIONAL, PHYSICAL, AND SPIRITUAL WELL-BEING AND OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE WERE FOUND. BARRIERS INCLUDED COMPETING TIME DEMANDS AND FEELING UNWELL. NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSION: THE PROGRAM WAS VIEWED AS AN ACCESSIBLE AND USEFUL ACTIVITY OPTION; HOWEVER, A DESIRE FOR GREATER SOCIAL SUPPORT FROM RELATABLE OTHERS WAS HIGHLIGHTED.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
14  342  28 ASHTANGA YOGA FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS FOR WEIGHT MANAGEMENT AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL BEING: AN UNCONTROLLED OPEN PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON WEIGHT IN YOUTH AT RISK FOR DEVELOPING TYPE 2 DIABETES. SECONDARILY, THE IMPACT OF PARTICIPATION IN YOGA ON SELF-CONCEPT AND PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS WAS MEASURED. METHODS: A 12-WEEK PROSPECTIVE PILOT ASHTANGA YOGA PROGRAM ENROLLED TWENTY CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS. WEIGHT WAS MEASURED BEFORE AND AFTER THE PROGRAM. ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED SELF-CONCEPT, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION INVENTORIES AT THE INITIATION AND COMPLETION OF THE PROGRAM. RESULTS: FOURTEEN PREDOMINATELY HISPANIC CHILDREN, AGES 8-15, COMPLETED THE PROGRAM. THE AVERAGE WEIGHT LOSS WAS 2KG. WEIGHT DECREASED FROM 61.2+/-20.2KG TO 59.2+/-19.2KG (P=0.01). FOUR OF FIVE CHILDREN WITH LOW SELF-ESTEEM IMPROVED, ALTHOUGH TWO HAD DECREASES IN SELF-ESTEEM. ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IMPROVED IN THE STUDY. CONCLUSION: ASHTANGA YOGA MAY BE BENEFICIAL AS A WEIGHT LOSS STRATEGY IN A PREDOMINATELY HISPANIC POPULATION.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
15 2806  34 YOGA THERAPY KNOWLEDGE IN THIRD-YEAR PHARMACY STUDENTS: AN EDUCATION INTERVENTION. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: THE OMISSION OF YOGA EDUCATION IN HEALTH PROFESSIONS CURRICULA LIMITS HEALTH PROFESSIONALS FROM UNDERSTANDING HOW TO SUPPORT PATIENT WELL-BEING IN AN INTEGRATED MANNER. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A YOGA THERAPY-BASED EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION IN INCREASING YOGA KNOWLEDGE OF THIRD-YEAR PHARMACY STUDENTS. EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SETTING: STUDENTS IN THE PHARMACOGNOSY AND COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE COURSE RECEIVED A THREE-HOUR EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION OVER TWO CLASS MEETINGS ON YOGA THERAPY DURING FALL 2019. THE PEDAGOGICAL METHOD OF PEER INSTRUCTION WAS USED, AND PRE- AND POST-QUESTIONNAIRES WERE ADMINISTERED ONLINE PRIOR TO AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION. THE INSTRUMENT CONTAINED EIGHT DEMOGRAPHIC, SIX YOGA KNOWLEDGE AND PARTICIPATION, 10 YOGA THERAPY, AND 15 REFERRAL BEHAVIOR QUESTIONS. FINDINGS: A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN YOGA KNOWLEDGE SCORES FROM 1.43 +/- 0.9 BEFORE THE EDUCATION INTERVENTION TO 5.69 +/- 1.65 AFTER THE INTERVENTION OCCURRED (P < .01) WAS FOUND. A MAJORITY BELIEVED THAT YOGA THERAPY SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE CURRICULUM. SUMMARY: INCREASES IN POST-QUESTIONNAIRE KNOWLEDGE SCORES SUGGESTED THAT THE EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION INCREASED PHARMACY STUDENTS' KNOWLEDGE OF YOGA THERAPY IN OUR SAMPLE. STUDIES SPECIFIC TO YOGA EDUCATION IN HEALTH PROFESSIONAL STUDENTS, ESPECIALLY IN THE UNITED STATES, ARE SCARCE. ADDITIONALLY, THE IMPACT OF AN EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION ON YOGA KNOWLEDGE IN PHARMACY STUDENTS HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED. INCLUDING YOGA THERAPY IN PHARMACY CURRICULA SHOULD BE EXPLORED AS GREATER INTEGRATION OF YOGA IN HEALTHCARE IS LIKELY TO OCCUR DUE TO ITS EFFECTIVENESS AS AN ADJUNCT AND WIDESPREAD USE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
16 2586  38 YOGA FOR HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS: A STUDY ON BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS OF ITS IMPLEMENTATION IN PRIMARY CARE. BACKGROUND: INTERNATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR HYPERTENSION TREATMENT RECOMMEND THE USE OF YOGA, PARTICULARLY AMONG LOW-RISK PATIENTS. HOWEVER, EVIDENCE IS LACKING ON THE IMPLEMENTATION POTENTIAL OF HEALTH-WORKER-LED YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN LOW-RESOURCE, PRIMARY CARE SETTINGS. OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS BARRIERS TO AND FACILITATORS OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS IN PRIMARY CARE IN NEPAL. METHODS: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED USING FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS, IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS, KEY INFORMANT INTERVIEWS, AND TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS. DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM THE 'YOGA AND HYPERTENSION' (YOH) TRIAL PARTICIPANTS, YOH INTERVENTION IMPLEMENTERS, AND OFFICIALS FROM THE MINISTRY OF HEALTH AND POPULATION IN NEPAL. RESULTS: MOST YOH TRIAL PARTICIPANTS STATED THAT: (1) IT WAS EASY TO LEARN YOGA DURING A FIVE-DAY TRAINING PERIOD AND PRACTISE IT FOR THREE MONTHS AT HOME; (2) PRACTISING YOGA IMPROVED THEIR HEALTH; AND (3) GROUP YOGA SESSIONS IN A COMMUNITY CENTRE WOULD HELP THEM PRACTISE YOGA MORE REGULARLY. MOST YOH INTERVENTION IMPLEMENTERS STATED THAT: (1) THEY WERE HIGHLY MOTIVATED TO IMPLEMENT THE INTERVENTION; (2) THE COST OF IMPLEMENTATION WAS ACCEPTABLE; (3) THEY DID NOT NEED ADDITIONAL STAFF TO EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT THE INTERVENTION; (4) PROVIDING REMUNERATION TO THE STAFF INVOLVED IN THE INTERVENTION WOULD INCREASE THEIR MOTIVATION; AND (5) THE YOGA PROGRAMME WAS 'SIMPLE AND EASY TO FOLLOW' AND 'EASILY PERFORMED BY PARTICIPANTS OF ANY AGE'. THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS STATED THAT: (1) YOGA IS CONSIDERED AS A KEY HEALTH PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITY IN NEPAL; AND (2) THE INTEGRATION OF THE YOGA INTERVENTION INTO THE EXISTING HEALTH CARE PROGRAMME WOULD NOT BE TOO CHALLENGING, BECAUSE THE EXISTING PERSONNEL AND OTHER RESOURCES CAN BE UTILISED. CONCLUSION: WHILE THERE IS A GOOD POTENTIAL THAT A YOGA INTERVENTION CAN BE IMPLEMENTED IN PRIMARY CARE, CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT FOR HEALTH WORKERS AND THE INVOLVEMENT OF COMMUNITY YOGA CENTRES IN THE DELIVERY OF THE INTERVENTIONS MAY BE REQUIRED TO FACILITATE THIS IMPLEMENTATION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
17 2869  52 YOGA-BASED PSYCHOTHERAPY GROUPS FOR BOYS EXPOSED TO TRAUMA IN URBAN SETTINGS. BACKGROUND: CHILDREN WHO EXPERIENCE ABUSE AND NEGLECT AND ARE EXPOSED TO ADVERSE LIFE EVENTS ARE AT RISK OF DEVELOPING EMOTIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS. THEY MAY DISPLAY VARIABLE INTERNALIZING AND EXTERNALIZING SYMPTOMS, SUCH AS POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, LOW SELF-ESTEEM, AND AGGRESSION. YOGA MAY BE ABLE TO REGULATE BODY-BRAIN PATHWAYS THAT CAUSE STRESS FOLLOWING TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES, THEREBY REDUCING ADVERSE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL SEQUELAE. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY IS TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN FUNCTIONING FOLLOWING MEETINGS OF A YOGA-BASED PSYCHOTHERAPY GROUP (YBPG) FOR BOYS WITH A HISTORY OF INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA EXPOSURE. METHODS/DESIGN: THE STUDY WAS A PROSPECTIVE, INTERVENTION COHORT STUDY. SETTING: THE STUDY OCCURRED AT AN URBAN-BASED MENTAL HEALTH CENTER FOCUSING ON TREATMENT OF CHILDREN EXPOSED TO INTERPERSONAL TRAUMA IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND FAMILIES. PARTICIPANTS: PARTICIPANTS WERE 10 BOYS, AGED 8-12 Y, WHO PRIMARILY WERE AFRICAN-AMERICANS (70%) AND WHO HAD A HISTORY OF TRAUMA. INTERVENTION: THE YBPG WAS A 12-WK, YOGA-BASED, GROUP THERAPY, INTEGRATED WITH MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT THAT WAS TRAUMA INFORMED AND EVIDENCE-BASED. OUTCOME MEASURES: MEASURES OF ATTENDANCE AND INTERPERSONAL FUNCTIONING-THE BEHAVIORAL AND EMOTIONAL RATING SCALE 2 (BERS-2) AND PATIENT SATISFACTION SURVEYS-WERE COLLECTED. THE PRE- AND POST-YBPG, PAIRED T TEST; WILCOXON'S SIGNED RANK TEST; AND EFFECT SIZES WERE CALCULATED TO ASSESS CHANGE IN INTERPERSONAL FUNCTIONING FOLLOWING THE YBPG, AS REPORTED BY THE PARENTS AND CHILDREN. RESULTS: THE BERS-2 SCORES YIELDED CLINICALLY AND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT MEAN IMPROVEMENTS ON THE PARENTS' RATINGS OF PARTICIPANTS' (1) INTERPERSONAL STRENGTH, INTRAPERSONAL STRENGTH, AND FAMILY INVOLVEMENT SCORES, WITH MEAN IMPROVEMENTS ON THOSE SUBSCALES BEING 1.4 (P=.007), 1.9 (P=.012), AND 1.4 (P=.045) POINTS, RESPECTIVELY; AND (2) STRENGTH INDEX SCORES, WITH A MEAN IMPROVEMENT OF 8.7 (P=.004). THE EFFECT SIZE WAS IN THE LARGE RANGE. IN ADDITION TO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS POSTTREATMENT, THE PARENTS' MEAN RATING SCORE OF THEIR CHILDREN'S FUNCTIONING WAS CLOSER BUT STILL LOWER THAN THE CHILDREN'S SELF-REPORTS ON ALL SUBSCALES. THE ATTENDANCE RATE FOR THE YBPG WAS AMONG THE HIGHEST FOR GROUP THERAPIES AT THE CENTER. CONCLUSIONS: THE STUDY PROVIDED PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE FOR THE FEASIBILITY OF YBPG AS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR BOYS EXPOSED TO TRAUMA IN URBAN SETTINGS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
18 2207  32 THE FEASIBILITY AND BENEFITS OF A 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION FOR PEDIATRIC CANCER OUT-PATIENTS. BACKGROUND: INCREASING RATES OF SURVIVAL PRESENT A NEW SET OF PSYCHOSOCIAL AND PHYSICAL CHALLENGES FOR CHILDREN UNDERGOING TREATMENT FOR CANCER. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (PA) HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE STRATEGY TO MITIGATE THE SIGNIFICANT BURDEN OF CANCER AND ITS TREATMENTS, WITH YOGA INCREASINGLY GAINING RECOGNITION AS A GENTLE ALTERNATIVE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND BENEFITS OF A 12-WEEK COMMUNITY-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQL), SELECT PHYSICAL FITNESS OUTCOMES AND PA LEVELS (PAL). PROCEDURE: EIGHT PEDIATRIC CANCER OUT-PATIENTS (4 MALE; 4 FEMALE; MAGE = 11.88, SD = 4.26) PARTICIPATED IN THE 12-WEEK INTERVENTION CONSISTING OF SUPERVISED YOGA SESSIONS 2 TIMES/WEEK. PARTICIPANTS (PATIENTS AND PARENT PROXIES) COMPLETED MEASURES ASSESSING HRQL, PHYSICAL FITNESS AND PAL AT BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION. RESULTS: RATES OF RECRUITMENT, RETENTION, ATTENDANCE AND ADVERSE EVENTS INDICATED THE PROGRAM WAS FEASIBLE. WILCOXON SIGNED RANK TESTS INDICATED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS FOR PATIENT (P = 0.02) AND PARENT REPORTED HRQL (P = 0.03), FUNCTIONAL MOBILITY (P = 0.01), HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY (LEFT, P = 0.01 AND RIGHT P = 0.02), AND TOTAL PAL (P = 0.02) PRE TO POST INTERVENTION. CONCLUSION: THIS 12-WEEK COMMUNITY-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION WAS FEASIBLE AND PROVIDES PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE FOR THE BENEFITS OF YOGA ON HRQL, PHYSICAL FITNESS AND PAL IN PEDIATRIC CANCER OUT-PATIENTS. IN A POPULATION WHERE SEDENTARY BEHAVIOR AND THE ASSOCIATED CO-MORBIDITIES ARE A GROWING CONCERN, THESE RESULTS PROMOTE THE CONTINUED EXPLORATION OF YOGA PROGRAMMING.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
19 1701  37 PARTICIPATION IN A YOGA STUDY DECREASES STRESS AND DEPRESSION SCORES FOR INCARCERATED WOMEN. INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS EXHIBIT A HIGH INCIDENCE OF STRESS-RELATED DISORDERS, INCLUDING ADDICTION AND POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD), AS WELL AS THE ADDED STRESS OF CAPTIVITY. ACCESS TO STRESS-REDUCTION TOOLS IS LIMITED FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS. ONE POSSIBLE APPROACH MAY BE REGULAR STRUCTURED YOGA CLASSES. USING TWO APPROACHES, WE TESTED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A BRIEF, INTENSIVE YOGA INTERVENTION IN A POPULATION OF INCARCERATED WOMEN IN A COUNTY JAIL. THE FIRST APPROACH WAS AN EXAMINATION OF ARCHIVAL DATA COLLECTED AS PART OF A PROGRAM ANALYSIS. INDIVIDUALS SHOWED CONSIDERABLE REDUCTION IN SELF-REPORTED STRESS FOLLOWING A SINGLE YOGA SESSION. THE SECOND APPROACH WAS AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY USING A WEEK-LONG YOGA INTERVENTION. THIRTY-FOUR PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSIGNED TO EITHER THE YOGA OR CONTROL GROUP FOR THE FIRST WEEK. IN THE SECOND WEEK, THE CONDITIONS WERE REVERSED. PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSESSED WEEKLY, BEFORE AND AFTER INTERVENTION. BASELINE SCORES REVEALED HIGH RATES OF DEPRESSION, STRESS, AND EXPOSURE TO TRAUMATIC LIFE EVENTS COMPARED TO NORMATIVE DATA. STRESS AND DEPRESSION WERE ASSESSED USING THE PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE AND BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY, RESPECTIVELY. COMPARED TO CONTROLS, PARTICIPANTS REPORTED LESS DEPRESSION AFTER A WEEK OF DAILY YOGA SESSIONS. PERCEIVED STRESS DECLINED UNDER BOTH CONTROL AND YOGA CONDITIONS. DUE TO THE TRANSIENT NATURE OF THE JAIL INSTITUTION, IT IS IMPORTANT TO EXAMINE INTERVENTIONS THAT CAN BE PROVIDED ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS. ALTHOUGH THERE WERE LIMITATIONS IN THIS STUDY, THE RESULTS SUPPORT THE CONCLUSION THAT THE BRIEF YOGA INTERVENTION HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON PARTICIPANTS' WELL-BEING.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
20 2740  45 YOGA PRACTICE AMONG VETERANS WITH AND WITHOUT CHRONIC PAIN: A MIXED METHODS STUDY. OBJECTIVES: THE PRIMARY AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE DIFFERENCES IN YOGA PRACTICE BETWEEN PERSONS WITH AND WITHOUT CHRONIC PAIN. SECONDARILY, WE DESCRIBE USE OF THE ESSENTIAL PROPERTIES OF YOGA QUESTIONNAIRE, SHORT FORM (EPYQ-SF) FOR SELF-REPORT. DESIGN: PARTICIPANTS WERE MEMBERS OF AN EXISTING COHORT OF VETERANS WHO COMPLETED A 2015-2016 SURVEY FOCUSED ON PAIN AND NONPHARMACOLOGICAL HEALTH PRACTICES. COHORT MEMBERS WHO REPORTED YOGA IN THE PAST YEAR [N=174 (9.4%) OF 1850] WERE ELIGIBLE FOR THE PRESENT STUDY, WHICH USED MULTIPLE-CONTACT MIXED-MODE SURVEY METHODOLOGY TO COLLECT DATA ON YOGA PRACTICES. THE EPYQ-SF WAS USED TO ASSESS PROPERTIES AND CONTEXT OF YOGA PRACTICE. PRACTICE PATTERNS WERE COMPARED FOR PARTICIPANTS WITH AND WITHOUT CHRONIC PAIN. TO EXPLORE POTENTIAL REASONS FOR REPORTED YOGA PRACTICE PATTERNS, FOCUSED SEMISTRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH A SUBSET OF PARTICIPANTS. RESULTS: OF 174 PARTICIPANTS CONTACTED, 141 (82%) RETURNED THE YOGA QUESTIONNAIRE AND 110 (78% OF RESPONDENTS) WERE STILL PRACTICING YOGA. AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS, 41 (37%) HAD CHRONIC PAIN. PRACTITIONERS WITH CHRONIC PAIN REPORTED GENTLER (2.8 VS. 3.1, 5-POINT SCALE) AND LESS ACTIVE (2.9 VS. 3.3) YOGA PRACTICE THAN THOSE WITHOUT. THOSE WITH CHRONIC PAIN ATTENDED YOGA STUDIOS LESS FREQUENTLY AND REPORTED SHORTER YOGA PRACTICES THAN THOSE WITHOUT. MOST YOGA PRACTICE WAS SELF-DIRECTED AND AT HOME. CONCLUSIONS: DIFFERENCES IN YOGA PRACTICE OF PERSONS WITH AND WITHOUT CHRONIC PAIN HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR CHRONIC PAIN. FUTURE INTERVENTIONS SHOULD FOCUS ON ALTERNATIVE INDIVIDUAL DELIVERY FORMATS OR ADDRESSING BARRIERS TO GROUP PRACTICE AMONG PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN.	2020

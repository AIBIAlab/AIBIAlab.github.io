1 2232 139 THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON INSPIRATORY MUSCLE PERFORMANCE IN VETERANS WITH COPD: A PILOT STUDY. CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD) CAUSES RESPIRATORY MUSCLE WEAKNESS THAT LEADS TO DISABLING DYSPNEA AND POOR FUNCTIONAL PERFORMANCE. THERAPIES ARE OFTEN GEARED TO IMPROVE INSPIRATORY MUSCLE PERFORMANCE. YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE EXERCISE CAPACITY, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND SOME PULMONARY FUNCTION MEASURES IN COPD, BUT LITTLE RESEARCH HAS EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA TRAINING ON INSPIRATORY MUSCLE PERFORMANCE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA TRAINING ON INSPIRATORY MUSCLE PERFORMANCE IN MILITARY VETERANS USING THE TEST OF INCREMENTAL RESPIRATORY ENDURANCE (TIRE). A PROSPECTIVE PILOT STUDY EXAMINED A 6-WEEK YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM CONSISTING OF ASANA (POSES) AND PRANAYAMA (CONTROLLED BREATHING). SUBJECTS HAD BASELINE INSPIRATORY MUSCLE WEAKNESS. THE TIRE MEASURED INSPIRATORY MUSCLE PERFORMANCE VIA THE PRO2 DEVICE, PROVIDING MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE, SUSTAINED MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE, AND INSPIRATORY DURATION. SECONDARY MEASURES INCLUDED 6-MINUTE WALK DISTANCE, ST. GEORGE RESPIRATORY QUESTIONNAIRE, HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE, AND SPIROMETRY. MEAN AGE AND BMI OF SUBJECTS WERE 67 +/- 3.6 YEARS AND 20.7 +/- 3.3, RESPECTIVELY. THE MAJORITY OF SUBJECTS HAD SEVERE (28.7%) OR VERY SEVERE (57.1%) COPD. STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVE M E N T S WERE SEEN IN MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE (39.0 +/- 14.1 CMH2O TO 56.4 +/- 20.6 CMH2O) AND SUSTAINED MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE (244.1 +/- 100.6 PTU TO 308.1 +/- 121.2 PTU). NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WE RE OBSERVED IN 6-MINUTE WALK DISTANCE, ST. GEORGE RESPIRATORY QUESTIONNAIRE, HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE, OR SPIROMETRY. YOGA TRAINING HAS THE POTENTIAL IN IMPROVE INSPIRATORY MUSCLE PERFORMANCE IN VETERANS WITH SEVERE TO VERY SEVERE COPD WHO PRESENT WITH INSPIRATORY MUSCLE WEAKNESS. THIS IS OF IMPORTANCE BECAUSE IMPROVING INSPIRA-TORY MUSCLE PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE COPD OUTCOMES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
2  865  30 EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICES ON PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS INCLUDING TRANSFER FACTOR OF LUNG FOR CARBON MONOXIDE (TLCO) IN ASTHMA PATIENTS. PRANA IS THE ENERGY, WHEN THE SELF-ENERGIZING FORCE EMBRACES THE BODY WITH EXTENSION AND EXPANSION AND CONTROL, IT IS PRANAYAMA. IT MAY AFFECT THE MILIEU AT THE BRONCHIOLES AND THE ALVEOLI PARTICULARLY AT THE ALVEOLO-CAPILLARY MEMBRANE TO FACILITATE DIFFUSION AND TRANSPORT OF GASES. IT MAY ALSO INCREASE OXYGENATION AT TISSUE LEVEL. AIM OF OUR STUDY IS TO COMPARE PULMONARY FUNCTIONS AND DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN PATIENTS OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA BEFORE AND AFTER YOGIC INTERVENTION OF 2 MONTHS. SIXTY STABLE ASTHMATIC-PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS I.E GROUP 1 (YOGA TRAINING GROUP) AND GROUP 2 (CONTROL GROUP). EACH GROUP INCLUDED THIRTY PATIENTS. LUNG FUNCTIONS WERE RECORDED ON ALL PATIENTS AT BASELINE, AND THEN AFTER TWO MONTHS. GROUP 1 SUBJECTS SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT (P<0.001) IN TRANSFER FACTOR OF THE LUNG FOR CARBON MONOXIDE (TLCO), FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1ST SEC (FEV1), PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR), MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION (MVV) AND SLOW VITAL CAPACITY (SVC) AFTER YOGA PRACTICE. QUALITY OF LIFE ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT PRANAYAMA & YOGA BREATHING AND STRETCHING POSTURES ARE USED TO INCREASE RESPIRATORY STAMINA, RELAX THE CHEST MUSCLES, EXPAND THE LUNGS, RAISE ENERGY LEVELS, AND CALM THE BODY.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
3  214  27 A STUDY OF THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA. THE ROLE OF YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES, AS AN ADJUNCT TREATMENT FOR BRONCHIAL ASTHMA IS WELL RECOGNIZED. ONE HUNDRED TWENTY PATIENTS OF ASTHMA WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS I.E GROUP A (YOGA TRAINING GROUP) AND GROUP B (CONTROL GROUP). EACH GROUP INCLUDED SIXTY PATIENTS. PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS WERE PERFORMED ON ALL THE PATIENTS AT BASELINE, AFTER 4 WEEKS AND THEN AFTER 8 WEEKS. MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS IN THE TWO GROUPS HAD MILD DISEASE (34 PATIENTS IN GROUP A AND 32 IN GROUP B). GROUP A SUBJECTS SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASING TREND (P < 0.01) IN % PREDICTED PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN THE FIRST SECOND (FEV1), FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), FORCED MID EXPIRATORY FLOW IN 0.25-0.75 SECONDS (FEF25-75) AND FEV1/FVC% RATIO AT 4 WEEKS AND 8 WEEKS AS COMPARED TO GROUP B. THUS, YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES USED ADJUNCTIVELY WITH STANDARD PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
4  792  47 EFFECT OF YOGA IN CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE. YOGA IS ADJUNCTIVELY UTILIZED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN THE TREATMENT OF A VARIETY OF DISEASES, INCLUDING CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD), BUT THERE ARE NO STUDIES ASSESSING ITS ADJUNCTIVE EFFICACY IN THE UNITED STATES. WE PROSPECTIVELY EVALUATED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA TRAINING ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AND THE PARAMETERS OF LUNG FUNCTION IN PATIENTS WITH COPD. THIRTY-THREE PATIENTS WITH DOCUMENTED COPD, PER GLOBAL INITIATIVE FOR OBSTRUCTIVE LUNG DISEASE CRITERIA, WERE RECRUITED. ALL PATIENTS RECEIVED STANDARD COPD CARE. THE QOL WAS ASSESSED BY THE ST. GEORGE RESPIRATORY QUESTIONNAIRE. STANDARD SPIROMETRY AND MAXIMUM INSPIRATORY (MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE) AND EXPIRATORY PRESSURE (MAXIMAL EXPIRATORY PRESSURE) WERE MEASURED. PATIENTS WERE TAUGHT SELECTED YOGA EXERCISES INCLUDING BREATHING EXERCISES, MEDITATION, AND YOGA POSTURES FOR 1 HOUR, THRICE A WEEK FOR 6 WEEKS BY A CERTIFIED YOGA THERAPIST. THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND LUNG FUNCTION WERE AGAIN ASSESSED AT THE END OF 6 WEEKS. TWENTY-TWO PATIENTS COMPLETED THE STUDY. DIFFERENCES IN PREYOGA VERSUS POSTYOGA SCORES WERE EVALUATED USING PAIRED T-TESTS. STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS (P < 0.05) WERE OBSERVED FOR THE ST. GEORGE RESPIRATORY QUESTIONNAIRE [95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) 43.13-58.47], VITAL CAPACITY (95% CI 2.53-7.65), MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE (95% CI 6.62-23.64), AND MAXIMAL EXPIRATORY PRESSURE (95% CI 1.63-13.81). YOGA WHEN PRACTICED BY PATIENTS WITH COPD RESULTS IN IMPROVEMENT IN THE QOL AND LUNG FUNCTION ON A SHORT-TERM BASIS. ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE FINDINGS IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL AND IN THE LONGER TERM.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
5 1520  38 IS YOGA TRAINING BENEFICIAL FOR EXERCISE-INDUCED BRONCHOCONSTRICTION? BACKGROUND: SOME STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH BRONCHIAL HYPERREACTIVITY WITH REGARD TO (1) A REDUCTION IN THE USE OF RESCUE MEDICATION, (2) AN INCREASE IN EXERCISE CAPACITY, AND (3) AN IMPROVEMENT IN LUNG FUNCTION. DESPITE THE FACT THAT YOGA IS PROMISING AS A NEW TREATMENT FOR PEDIATRIC PATIENTS, FURTHER STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO ASSESS THE USE OF THIS TRAINING FOR ASTHMA MANAGEMENT. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY WAS PERFORMED TO ASSESS THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA IN EXERCISE-INDUCED BRONCHOCONSTRICTION (EIB) IN CHILDREN. DESIGN: THE STUDY WAS PROSPECTIVE, WITH NO CONTROL GROUP. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY CHOSEN AMONG THE NEW PATIENTS AT THE UNIT. SETTING: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN THE ERCIYES UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, PEDIATRIC ALLERGY UNIT, IN KAYSERI, TURKEY. PARTICIPANTS: TWO GROUPS OF ASTHMATIC CHILDREN AGED 6-17 Y WERE ENROLLED IN THE STUDY: (1) CHILDREN WITH POSITIVE RESPONSES TO AN EXERCISE CHALLENGE (N = 10), AND (2) THOSE WITH NEGATIVE RESPONSES (N = 10). INTERVENTION: BOTH GROUPS ATTENDED 1-H SESSIONS OF YOGA TRAINING 2 X/WK FOR 3 MO. OUTCOME MEASURES: RESEARCHERS ADMINISTERED SPIROMETRIC MEASUREMENT TO ALL CHILDREN BEFORE AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER PARTICIPATING IN AN EXERCISE CHALLENGE. THIS PROCESS WAS PERFORMED AT BASELINE AND AT THE STUDY'S END. AGE, GENDER, IGE LEVELS, EOSINOPHIL NUMBERS, AND SPIROMETRIC MEASUREMENT PARAMETERS INCLUDING FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1 SEC (FEV1), FORCED EXPIRATORY FLOW 25%-75% (FEF25%-75%), FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW PERCENTAGE (PEF%), AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR) WERE COMPARED USING THE MANN-WHITNEY U TEST AND THE WILCOXON TEST. A P VALUE < .05 WAS CONSIDERED SIGNIFICANT. RESULTS: AT BASELINE, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED BETWEEN THE GROUPS REGARDING DEMOGRAPHICS OR PRE-EXERCISE SPIROMETRIC MEASUREMENTS (P > .05, MANN-WHITNEY U TEST). LIKEWISE, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN SPIROMETRIC MEASUREMENTS EXISTED BETWEEN THE GROUPS REGARDING THE CHANGE IN RESPONSES TO AN EXERCISE CHALLENGE AFTER YOGA TRAINING (P > .05, WILCOXON TEST). FOR THE EXERCISE-RESPONSE-POSITIVE GROUP, THE RESEARCH TEAM OBSERVED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN MAXIMUM FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME 1% (FEV1%) FALL FOLLOWING THE EXERCISE CHALLENGE AFTER YOGA TRAINING (P > .05, WILCOXON TEST). ALL EXERCISE-RESPONSE-POSITIVE ASTHMATICS BECAME EXERCISERESPONSE-NEGATIVE ASTHMATICS AFTER YOGA TRAINING. CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT TRAINING CHILDREN IN THE PRACTICE OF YOGA HAD BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON EIB. IT IS THE RESEARCH TEAM'S OPINION THAT YOGA TRAINING CAN SUPPLEMENT DRUG THERAPY TO ACHIEVE BETTER CONTROL OF ASTHMA.	2014	
                                                                                                                                           
6  880  33 EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON HANDGRIP, RESPIRATORY PRESSURES AND PULMONARY FUNCTION. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REPORTS ON THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS, VERY FEW STUDIES HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN ON THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON RESPIRATORY PRESSURES AND HANDGRIP ENDURANCE. HENCE THE PRESENT WORK WAS PLANNED TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON HAND GRIP STRENGTH (HGS), HAND GRIP ENDURANCE (HGE), MAXIMUM EXPIRATORY PRESSURE (MEP), MAXIMUM INSPIRATORY PRESSURE (MIP), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME (FEV), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN FIRST SECOND (FEV1) AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR). 20 SCHOOL CHILDREN IN THE AGE GROUP OF 12 TO 15 YEARS WERE GIVEN YOGA TRAINING (ASANS AND PRANAYAMS) FOR 6 MONTHS. 20 AGE AND GENDER-MATCHED STUDENTS FORMED THE CONTROL GROUP. YOGA TRAINING PRODUCED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.05) INCREASE IN HGS AND HGE. MEP, MIP, FEV, FEV1 AND PEFR ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (P < 0.001) AFTER THE YOGA TRAINING. IN CONTRAST, THE INCREASE IN THESE PARAMETERS IN THE CONTROL GROUP WAS STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT. OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT YOGA TRAINING FOR 6 MONTHS IMPROVES LUNG FUNCTION, STRENGTH OF INSPIRATORY AND EXPIRATORY MUSCLES AS WELL AS SKELETAL MUSCLE STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT YOGA BE INTRODUCED AT SCHOOL LEVEL IN ORDER TO IMPROVE PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS, OVERALL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE OF STUDENTS.	2003	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
7  305  28 AN EVALUATION OF PULMONARY PARAMETERS IN TWO GROUPS OF SUBJECTS DURING YOGA PRACTICE. THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE HOW FAR THE SHORT TERM PRACTICE OF YOGA (30 AND 60 DAYS) FOR AN HOUR DAILY CAN IMPROVE THE RESPIRATORY FUNCTION. MALE SUBJECTS (N=50, AGE 30-50 YEARS) WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED. RESPIRATORY PARAMETERS (FVC, FEV1, PEFR, FEF(25-75%) AND MVV) WERE DETERMINED BY USING A MULTIFUNCTIONAL COMPUTERIZED SPIROMETER. YOGA (POSTURE AND PRANAYAMAS) PRACTICE FOR A MONTH PRODUCED NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN PULMONARY PARAMETERS. NEVERTHELESS, WHEN THE SUBJECTS CONTINUED IT FOR NEXT 30 DAYS, I.E., AFTER 60 DAYS SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE NOTED IN FVC (P<0.001), FEV, (P<0.01) AND PEFR (P<0.05). THE RESULT ALSO REVEALED THAT AMONGST THEM 30 DAYS YOGA TRAINING RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN FVC IN ELDER GROUP OF PEOPLE (AGE 41-50 YRS) WHERE AS IN YOUNGER GROUP (AGE 30-40 YRS) THE CHANGES WERE NOT SO PROMINENT. RESULT INDICATED THAT SHORT TERM (30 DAYS) YOGA PRACTICE QUICKLY IMPROVES RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS IN RELATIVELY ELDER PEOPLE (AGE 41-50 YRS), WHEN MANY OF THEM IN OUR TROPICAL COUNTRY SUFFER FROM PRIMARY LEVEL OF RESPIRATORY PROBLEM. REGULAR PRACTICE OF YOGA (POSTURE AND PRANAYAMAS) CAN PREVENT IT BY INCREASING THE EFFICACY OF RESPIRATORY MUSCLES.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
8 2823  30 YOGA VERSUS AEROBIC ACTIVITY: EFFECTS ON SPIROMETRY RESULTS AND MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE. OBJECTIVE: TO CLARIFY WHETHER, IN HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS, PRACTICING YOGA CAN MODIFY MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE AND SPIROMETRIC INDICES WHEN COMPARED WITH THE PRACTICE OF AEROBIC EXERCISE. MEYHODS: A CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL. A TOTAL OF 31 HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS WERE ALLOCATED TO PRACTICE AEROBIC EXERCISE (N = 15) OR TO PRACTICE YOGA (N = 16). THOSE IN THE FIRST GROUP SERVED AS CONTROLS AND ENGAGED IN AEROBIC EXERCISE FOR 45-60 MINUTES, TWICE A WEEK FOR THREE MONTHS. THOSE IN THE SECOND GROUP PRACTICED SELECTED YOGIC TECHNIQUES, ALSO IN SESSIONS OF 45-60 MINUTES, TWICE A WEEK FOR THREE MONTHS. FORCED VITAL CAPACITY, FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN ONE SECOND AND MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE WERE MEASURED BEFORE AND AFTER THE THREE MONTHS OF TRAINING. RESULTS: NO SIGNIFICANT ALTERATIONS WERE SEEN IN THE SPIROMETRIC INDICES. A SLIGHT, ALTHOUGH NOT SIGNIFICANT, IMPROVEMENT IN MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE WAS SEEN IN BOTH GROUPS. HOWEVER, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE, SEEN IN BOTH GENDERS, BETWEEN THE ABSOLUTE DELTA (FINAL VALUE MINUS BASELINE VALUE) OF MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE FOR THE GROUP PRACTICING YOGA AND THAT OBTAINED FOR THE GROUP ENGAGING IN AEROBIC EXERCISE (MALES: 19.5 CM H2O VERSUS 2.8 CM H2O, P = 0.05; FEMALES: 20 CM H2O VERSUS 3.9 CM H2O, P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: NEITHER YOGA NOR AEROBIC EXERCISE PROVIDED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE AFTER THREE MONTHS. HOWEVER, THE ABSOLUTE VARIATION IN MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE WAS GREATER AMONG THOSE PRACTICING YOGA.	2006	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
9  904  31 EFFECTIVENESS OF ADJUVANT YOGA THERAPY IN DIABETIC LUNG: A RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL. CONTEXT: RECENT STUDIES PROVIDE AMPLE EVIDENCE OF THE BENEFITS OF YOGA IN VARIOUS CHRONIC DISORDERS. DIABETES MELLITUS IS A GROUP OF METABOLIC DISEASES CHARACTERIZED BY CHRONIC HYPERGLYCEMIA AND SANDLER COINED THE TERM "DIABETIC LUNG" FOR THE ABNORMAL PULMONARY FUNCTION DETECTED IN DIABETIC PATIENTS DUE UNDERLYING PULMONARY DYSFUNCTION. YOGA THERAPY MAY HELP IN ACHIEVING BETTER PULMONARY FUNCTION ALONG WITH ENHANCED GLYCAEMIC CONTROL AND OVERALL HEALTH BENEFITS. AIM: TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF ADJUVANT YOGA THERAPY IN DIABETIC LUNG THROUGH SPIROMETRY. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL WAS MADE AS INTERDISCIPLINARY COLLABORATIVE WORK BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS OF YOGA THERAPY, PULMONARY MEDICINE AND ENDOCRINOLOGY, OF MGMC & RI, SRI BALAJI VIDYAPEETH PUDUCHERRY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 72 PATIENTS OF DIABETIC LUNG AS CONFIRMED BY SPIROMETRY (<70% OF EXPECTED) WERE RANDOMIZED INTO CONTROL GROUP (N=36) WHO RECEIVED ONLY STANDARD MEDICAL TREATMENT AND YOGA GROUP (N=36) WHO RECEIVED YOGA TRAINING THRICE WEEKLY FOR 4 MONTHS ALONG WITH STANDARD MEDICAL MANAGEMENT. YOGA THERAPY PROTOCOL INCLUDED YOGIC COUNSELING, PREPARATORY PRACTICES, ASANAS OR STATIC POSTURES, PRANAYAMA OR BREATHING TECHNIQUES AND RELAXATION TECHNIQUES. HATHENAS OF THE GITANANDA YOGA TRADITION WERE THE MAIN PRACTICES USED. SPIROMETRY WAS DONE AT THE END OF THE STUDY PERIOD. DATA WAS ANALYZED BY STUDENT'S PAIRED AND UNPAIRED 'T' TEST AS IT PASSED NORMALITY. RESULTS: THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.05) REDUCTION IN WEIGHT, AND BMI ALONG WITH A SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.01) IMPROVEMENT IN PULMONARY FUNCTION (FEV1, FVC) IN YOGA GROUP AS COMPARED TO CONTROL GROUP WHERE PARAMETERS WORSENED OVER STUDY PERIOD. CONCLUSION: IT IS CONCLUDED FROM THE PRESENT RCT THAT YOGA HAS A DEFINITE ROLE AS AN ADJUVANT THERAPY AS IT ENHANCES STANDARD MEDICAL CARE AND HENCE IS EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT IN ROUTINE CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES, IMPROVING PHYSICAL CONDITION AND PULMONARY FUNCTION.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
10 1798  30 PREOPERATIVE REHABILITATION IN LUNG CANCER PATIENTS: YOGA APPROACH. LUNG CANCER IS ONE OF THE LEADING CAUSES OF CANCER DEATH WORLDWIDE. SURGICAL REMOVAL REMAINS THE BEST OPTION FOR MOST TUMORS OF THIS TYPE. REDUCTION OF CIGARETTE CONSUMPTION IN PATIENTS WITH LUNG CANCER CANDIDATES FOR THE SURGERY COULD LIMIT THE IMPACT OF TOBACCO ON POSTSURGICAL OUTCOMES. BREATHING EXERCISES APPEAR TO HELP COMBAT CIGARETTE CRAVINGS. YOGA EXERCISE BENEFITS HAVE BEEN STUDIED IN LUNG CANCER SURVIVORS, RATHER THAN IN THE PREOPERATIVE SETTING. IN THIS STUDY, WE HAVE RECRUITED 32 ACTIVE SMOKERS AFFECTED BY LUNG CANCER AND BEING CANDIDATES FOR PULMONARY SURGERY. THE PATIENTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO TWO GROUPS: ONE TREATED BY STANDARD BREATHING AND THE OTHER TREATED BY YOGA BREATHING (YB). THE GROUPS WERE EVALUATED AT TIMES T0 (BASELINE) AND T1 (AFTER 7 DAYS OF TREATMENT) TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF THE TWO BREATHING TREATMENTS ON PULMONARY PERFORMANCE IN A PRESURGERY SETTING.

11  878  32 EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING AND DETRAINING ON RESPIRATORY MUSCLE STRENGTH IN PRE-PUBERTAL CHILDREN: A RANDOMIZED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN I(ST) SECOND (FEV1), PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR), FEVI/FVC RATIO, AND PULMONARY PRESSURES [MAXIMUM INSPIRATORY PRESSURE (MIP), MAXIMUM EXPIRATORY PRESSURE (MEP) AT THE END OF 3 MONTHS YOGA TRAINING AND THE DETRAINING EFFECT ON THE ABOVE PARAMETERS IN 7-9-YEARS-OLD SCHOOL GOING CHILDREN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 100 PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED FROM A SCHOOL IN BANGALORE. AFTER BASELINE ASSESSMENTS, THE PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO EITHER YOGA OR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY GROUP. INTERVENTION WAS GIVEN FOR 3 MONTHS, AND MEASURES OF PULMONARY FUNCTION AND PULMONARY PRESSURES WERE DETERMINED IMMEDIATELY POST-INTERVENTION AND AT 3-MONTHS FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: ALTHOUGH SIGNIFICANT INCREASE WAS OBSERVED IN FVC, FEV1, PEFR, FEV1/FVC, MIP, AND MEP AT POST-INTERVENTION, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO STUDY GROUPS AFTER ADJUSTING FOR HEIGHT AND AGE POST TRAINING . HOWEVER, MIP INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN BOTH THE GROUPS POST-INTERVENTION, BUT THE YOGA GROUP PERFORMED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE PE GROUP. THE EFFECTS OF TRAINING DID NOT FADE OFF EVEN AFTER 3 MONTHS OF DETRAINING. IN FACT, THE FVC AND FEV1 CONTINUED TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY. A TREND OF DECREASE WAS OBSERVED IN PEFR, MIP, AND MEP. HOWEVER, THE VALUES DID NOT REGRESS TO THE BASELINE VALUE. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT PRACTICE OF YOGA FOR A SHORT DURATION (3 MONTHS) OF TIME CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE RESPIRATORY MUSCLE STRENGTH IN PEDIATRIC POPULATION.	2014

13  867  34 EFFECT OF YOGA REGIMEN ON LUNG FUNCTIONS INCLUDING DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE PATIENTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. BACKGROUND: LUNG FUNCTIONS ARE FOUND TO BE IMPAIRED IN CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD), CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE, LEFT VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION, AND AFTER CARDIAC SURGERY. DIFFUSION CAPACITY PROGRESSIVELY WORSENS AS THE SEVERITY OF CAD INCREASES DUE TO REDUCTION IN LUNG TISSUE PARTICIPATING IN GAS EXCHANGE. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISES AND YOGIC POSTURES MAY PLAY AN IMPRESSIVE ROLE IN IMPROVING CARDIO-RESPIRATORY EFFICIENCY AND FACILITATING GAS DIFFUSION AT THE ALVEOLO-CAPILLARY MEMBRANE. THIS STUDY WAS DONE TO SEE THE EFFECT OF YOGA REGIMEN ON LUNG FUNCTIONS PARTICULARLY DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN CAD PATIENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 80 STABLE CAD PATIENTS BELOW 65 YEARS OF AGE OF BOTH SEXES WERE SELECTED AND RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS OF 40 EACH. GROUP I CAD PATIENTS WERE GIVEN YOGA REGIMEN FOR 3 MONTHS WHICH CONSISTED OF YOGIC POSTURES, PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISES, DIETARY MODIFICATION, AND HOLISTIC TEACHING ALONG WITH THEIR CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE WHILE GROUP II CAD PATIENTS WERE PUT ONLY ON CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE. LUNG FUNCTIONS INCLUDING DIFFUSION CAPACITY WERE RECORDED THRICE IN BOTH THE GROUPS: 0 DAY AS BASELINE, 22(ND) DAY AND ON 90(TH) DAY BY USING COMPUTERIZED MS MEDISOFT CARDIO-RESPIRATORY INSTRUMENT, HYP'AIR COMPACT MODEL OF CARDIO-RESPIRATORY TESTING MACHINE WAS MANUFACTURED BY P K MORGAN, INDIA. THE RECORDED PARAMETERS WERE STATISTICALLY ANALYZED BY REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA FOLLOWED BY TUKEY'S TEST IN BOTH THE GROUPS. CARDIOVASCULAR PARAMETERS WERE ALSO COMPARED BEFORE AND AFTER INTERVENTION IN BOTH THE GROUPS. RESULTS: STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE SEEN IN SLOW VITAL CAPACITY, FORCED VITAL CAPACITY, PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE, MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION, AND DIFFUSION FACTOR/ TRANSFER FACTOR OF LUNG FOR CARBON MONOXIDE AFTER 3 MONTHS OF YOGA REGIMEN IN GROUP I. FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1(ST) SEC (FEV1), AND FEV1 % ALSO SHOWED A TREND TOWARD IMPROVEMENT ALTHOUGH NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. HR, SBP AND DBP ALSO SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN GROUP-I PATIENTS WHO FOLLOWED YOGA REGIMEN. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA REGIMEN WAS FOUND TO IMPROVE LUNG FUNCTIONS AND DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN CAD PATIENTS BESIDES IMPROVING CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTIONS. THUS, IT CAN BE USED AS A COMPLIMENTARY OR ADJUNCT THERAPY ALONG WITH THE CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE FOR THEIR TREATMENT AND REHABILITATION.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
14  787  27 EFFECT OF YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES (PRANAYAMA) ON AIRWAY REACTIVITY IN SUBJECTS WITH ASTHMA. THE EFFECTS OF TWO PRANAYAMA YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES ON AIRWAY REACTIVITY, AIRWAY CALIBRE, SYMPTOM SCORES, AND MEDICATION USE IN PATIENTS WITH MILD ASTHMA WERE ASSESSED IN A RANDOMISED, DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, CROSSOVER TRIAL. AFTER BASELINE ASSESSMENT OVER 1 WEEK, 18 PATIENTS WITH MILD ASTHMA PRACTISED SLOW DEEP BREATHING FOR 15 MIN TWICE A DAY FOR TWO CONSECUTIVE 2-WEEK PERIODS. DURING THE ACTIVE PERIOD, SUBJECTS WERE ASKED TO BREATHE THROUGH A PINK CITY LUNG (PCL) EXERCISER--A DEVICE WHICH IMPOSES SLOWING OF BREATHING AND A 1:2 INSPIRATION:EXPIRATION DURATION RATIO EQUIVALENT TO PRANAYAMA BREATHING METHODS; DURING THE CONTROL PERIOD, SUBJECTS BREATHED THROUGH A MATCHED PLACEBO DEVICE. MEAN FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1 S (FEV1), PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE, SYMPTOM SCORE, AND INHALER USE OVER THE LAST 3 DAYS OF EACH TREATMENT PERIOD WERE ASSESSED IN COMPARISON WITH THE BASELINE ASSESSMENT PERIOD; ALL IMPROVED MORE WITH THE PCL EXERCISER THAN WITH THE PLACEBO DEVICE, BUT THE DIFFERENCES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT. THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE DOSE OF HISTAMINE NEEDED TO PROVOKE A 20% REDUCTION IN FEV1 (PD20) DURING PRANAYAMA BREATHING BUT NOT WITH THE PLACEBO DEVICE. THE USEFULNESS OF CONTROLLED VENTILATION EXERCISES IN THE CONTROL OF ASTHMA SHOULD BE FURTHER INVESTIGATED.	1990	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
15 1376  32 IMPACT OF HATHA YOGA ON THE AIRWAY RESISTANCES IN HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS AND ALLERGIC RHINITIS PATIENTS. THERE HAVE BEEN LIMITED STUDIES ON HATHA YOGA TRAINING AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY TO MANAGE THE SYMPTOMS OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS. THE MAIN AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO CHECK THE IMPACT OF HATHA YOGASANAS ON THE AIRWAY RESISTANCES IN HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS, A BASELINE DATA CAN BE ESTABLISHED AND ALSO TO STUDY THE IMPACT OF HATHA YOGASANAS ON THE AIRWAY RESISTANCES IN ALLERGIC RHINITIS PATIENTS IN BANGALORE, INDIA. THIS IS A PROSPECTIVE CASE SERIES OF 51 HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS (18 MALES AND 33 FEMALES) GROUP 1 AND 51 ALLERGIC RHINITIS PATIENTS (18 MALES AND 33 FEMALES) GROUP 2. THE OBJECTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE UPPER AIRWAY RESISTANCE WAS MEASURED USING A RHINOMANOMETER AND THE LOWER AIRWAY RESISTANCE WAS MEASURED USING A SPIROMETER. THEN THE SUBJECTS PRACTICED SPECIFIC HATHA YOGASANAS FOR THREE MONTHS. THEN THE AIRWAY RESISTANCE TESTS WERE AGAIN DONE AT 3 MONTHS INTERVAL. THE SUBJECTIVE ANALYSIS WAS DONE PRE YOGA AND POST YOGA USING THE SHORT FORM-12 (SF-12) AND SINO NASAL OUTCOME TEST (SNOT) QUESTIONNAIRES TO ASSESS THE QUALITY OF LIFE. THE DATA WAS ANALYZED BY DOING A PAIRED (2-TAILED) T TEST, USING SPSS (SOFTWARE PACKAGE FOR SOCIAL SCIENCES) VERSION 16. TOTAL NASAL AIRWAY RESISTANCE PRE YOGA AND POST YOGA IN 51 HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED AT 150 PA AND THE FORCED VITAL CAPACITY(FVC) PRE YOGA AND POST YOGA HAD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED,FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME (FEV1) & % RESIDUAL STANDARD DEVIATION (%RSD) HAD INCREASED BUT NOT SIGNIFICANT. THE PHYSICAL COMPONENT SCORE (PCS) AND MENTAL COMPONENT SCORE (MCS) OF THE SF-12 HEALTH SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRE HAD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED WITH AND THE SNOT QUESTIONNAIRE SCORE HAD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED. THE TOTAL NASAL AIRWAY RESISTANCE IN 51 ALLERGIC RHINITIS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED AT 150 PA AND THE FVC PRE YOGA AND POST YOGA SHOWED INCREASE BUT CHANGE WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT, FEV1 PRE YOGA AND POST YOGA HAD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED, %RSD PRE YOGA AND POST YOGA HAD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED. THE PCS AND MCS OF THE SF-12 HEALTH SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRE HAD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED AND THE SNOT QUESTIONNAIRE SCORE HAD SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED. THE SCIENTIFIC DOCUMENTATION OF THE IMPACT OF HATHA YOGA ON THE AIRWAY RESISTANCES CAN BE AN EYE OPENER IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SEVERAL OTHER DISEASES OF THE AIRWAYS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
16 2786  28 YOGA THERAPY AS AN ADJUVANT IN MANAGEMENT OF ASTHMA. OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON CONTROL OF ASTHMA IN CHILDREN WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA. METHODS: THIS HOSPITAL-BASED INTERVENTIONAL RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL CONDUCTED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PEDIATRICS AT A TERTIARY CARE CENTER OF NORTH INDIA FROM NOVEMBER 2017 TO OCTOBER 2018 ENROLLED 140 NEWLY DIAGNOSED CASES OF ASTHMA OF AGE 10-16 Y WHO WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS. SEVENTY CHILDREN IN THE CASE GROUP PRACTICED YOGA UNDER SUPERVISION FOR A PERIOD OF 3 MO IN ADDITION TO PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT. SEVENTY CONTROLS RECEIVED ONLY PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT. PULMONARY-FUNCTION TESTS WERE DONE AT BASELINE, 6 WK, AND 12 WK ALONG WITH QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) ASSESSMENT BY PEDIATRIC ASTHMA QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE (PAQLQ). THE OUTCOME MEASURES ASSESSED WERE FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN ONE SECOND (FEV1), FEV1/FVC AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR). QOL EVALUATION WAS DONE IN 3 DOMAINS: ACTIVITY LIMITATION, SYMPTOMS, AND EMOTIONAL FUNCTION. RESULTS: THE ASTHMATIC CHILDREN PRACTICING YOGA HAVE SHOWN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN FVC, FEV1, FEV1/FVC AND PEFR WHICH WAS BETTER AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS. IMPROVEMENT WAS ALSO NOTED IN MEAN-PAQLQ SCORE IN CASES WHICH WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS. CONCLUSION: YOGA APPEARS TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECT ON CONTROL OF ASTHMA MEASURED BY PULMONARY-FUNCTION TEST AND QOL. THEREFORE YOGA THERAPY CAN BE RECOMMENDED AS AN ADJUVANT IN MANAGEMENT OF ASTHMA ALONG WITH STANDARD PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
17  751  18 EFFECT OF SHORT TERM YOGA PRACTICE ON VENTILATORY FUNCTION TESTS. TWENTYFIVE NORMAL MALE VOLUNTEERS UNDERGOING A TEN WEEKS COURSE IN THE PRACTICE OF YOGA HAVE BEEN STUDIED BY SOME PARAMETERS OF VENTILATORY FUNCTIONS TESTS. THE OBSERVATIONS RECORDED AT THE END OF TEN WEEKS OF THE COURSE HAVE SHOWN IMPROVED VENTILATORY FUNCTIONS IN THE FORM OF LOWERED RESPIRATORY RATE, INCREASED FORCED VITAL CAPACITY, FEV1, MAXIMUM BREATHING CAPACITY AND BREATH HOLDING TIME, WHILE TIDAL VOLUME AND %FEV1, DID NOT REVEAL ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. THUS, A COMBINED PRACTICE OF YOGA SEEMS TO BE BENEFICIAL ON RESPIRATORY EFFICIENCY.	1988	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
18  419  42 BREATHING-FOCUSED YOGA INTERVENTION ON RESPIRATORY DECLINE IN CHRONICALLY PESTICIDE-EXPOSED FARMERS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO PESTICIDES HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH LUNG AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION EXACERBATIONS. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WE TESTED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BREATHING FOCUSED YOGA INTERVENTION ON ALLEVIATION OF ADVERSE RESPIRATORY AND COGNITIVE EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH CHRONIC PESTICIDE EXPOSURE IN FARMERS. METHODS: WE UNDERTOOK A PARALLEL, TWO-ARMED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH BLINDED OUTCOME ASSESSORS ON A CHRONICALLY PESTICIDE-EXPOSED FARMING POPULATION. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT DISTRICT PANIPAT, STATE HARYANA LOCATED IN THE NORTHERN PART OF INDIA FROM NOVEMBER 2019 TO AUGUST 2020. A TOTAL OF 634 FARMERS WERE SCREENED, AND 140 FARMERS WERE RANDOMIZED TO BREATHING-FOCUSED YOGA INTERVENTION (BFY, N = 70) AND WAITLIST CONTROL ARMS (N = 65). BFY WAS DELIVERED WEEKLY IN 45-MIN GROUP SESSIONS OVER 12 WEEKS FOLLOWED BY HOME-BASED PRACTICE. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS THE CHANGE IN SPIROMETRY-BASED MARKERS OF PULMONARY FUNCTION FROM BASELINE EXPRESSED AS RAW VALUES, GLOBAL LUNG INITIATIVE (GLI) PERCENT PREDICTED (PP), AND GLI Z-SCORES AFTER 24 WEEKS OF INTERVENTION. SECONDARY VARIABLES WERE TRAIL MAKING TESTS (TMT A AND B), DIGIT SYMBOL SUBSTITUTION (DSST), AND WHO QUALITY OF LIFE-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF). ANALYSIS WAS BY INTENTION-TO-TREAT. MEDIATION ANALYSIS WAS DONE CONSIDERING OXIDATIVE STRESS MARKERS AS POTENTIAL MEDIATORS. RESULTS: AT THE END OF 6 MONTHS OF INTERVENTION, THE OVERALL FOLLOW-UP IN THE PARTICIPANTS WAS 87.85% (N = 123); 90% (N = 63) IN THE CONTROL GROUP, AND 85.71% IN THE YOGA GROUP (N = 60). THE MEAN AGE OF THE STUDY COHORT (N = 140) WAS 38.75 (SD = 7.50) YEARS. COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP, AT 24 WEEKS POST-INTERVENTION, THE BFY GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED STATUS OF THE RAW SAND Z SCORES MARKERS OF AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION, AFTER ADJUSTING FOR CONFOUNDERS, FEV1, FVC, FEF25-75 [Z SCORE-ADJUSTED MEAN DIFFERENCES (95% CI); 1.66 (1.10-2.21) 1.88 (1.21-2.55), AND 6.85 (5.12-8.57), RESPECTIVELY. A FRACTION OF FEF25-75 CHANGE (MEDIATION PERCENTAGE 23.95%) WAS EXPLAINED BY GLUTATHIONE AUGMENTATION. THERE WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN COGNITIVE SCORES OF DSST, TMT-A AND TMT-B, AND WHOQOL-BREF. CONCLUSION: IN CONCLUSION, REGULAR PRACTICE OF BFY COULD IMPROVE THE EXACERBATIONS IN THE MARKERS OF AIRWAY OBSTRUCTION IN CHRONICALLY PESTICIDE-EXPOSED FARMERS AND COGNITIVE VARIABLES. A SIGNIFICANT MEDIATING EFFECT OF GLUTATHIONE AUGMENTATION WAS ALSO OBSERVED CONCERNING THE EFFECT OF THE INTERVENTION ON FEF25-75. THESE FINDINGS PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF BENEFICIAL EVIDENCE OF THE BREATHING-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION THAT NEEDS VALIDATION ACROSS DIFFERENT FARMING ETHNICITIES.CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION:WWW.CLINICALTRIALS.GOV, IDENTIFIER: CTRI/2019/11/021989.	2022	

19  488  24 CLINICAL STUDY OF YOGA TECHNIQUES IN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS WITH ASTHMA: A CONTROLLED STUDY. ADULT ASTHMATICS, RANGING FROM 19 TO 52 YEARS FROM AN ASTHMA AND ALLERGY CLINIC IN A UNIVERSITY SETTING VOLUNTEERED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY. THE 17 STUDENTS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO YOGA (9 SUBJECTS) AND NONYOGA CONTROL (8 SUBJECTS) GROUPS. THE YOGA GROUP WAS TAUGHT A SET OF BREATHING AND RELAXATION TECHNIQUES INCLUDING BREATH SLOWING EXERCISES (PRANAYAMA), PHYSICAL POSTURES (YOGASANAS), AND MEDITATION. YOGA TECHNIQUES WERE TAUGHT AT THE UNIVERSITY HEALTH CENTER, THREE TIMES A WEEK FOR 16 WEEKS. ALL THE SUBJECTS IN BOTH GROUPS MAINTAINED DAILY SYMPTOM AND MEDICATION DIARIES, COLLECTED A.M. AND P.M. PEAK FLOW READINGS, AND COMPLETED WEEKLY QUESTIONNAIRES. SPIROMETRY WAS PERFORMED ON EACH SUBJECT EVERY WEEK. ANALYSIS OF THE DATA SHOWED THAT THE SUBJECTS IN THE YOGA GROUP REPORTED A SIGNIFICANT DEGREE OF RELAXATION, POSITIVE ATTITUDE, AND BETTER YOGA EXERCISE TOLERANCE. THERE WAS ALSO A TENDENCY TOWARD LESSER USAGE OF BETA ADRENERGIC INHALERS. THE PULMONARY FUNCTIONS DID NOT VARY SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS.

20 1123  17 EFFICACY OF NATUROPATHY AND YOGA IN BRONCHIAL ASTHMA. THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF A ONE MONTH IN-PATIENT NATUROPATHY AND YOGA PROGRAMME FOR PATIENTS WITH ASTHMA. RETROSPECTIVE DATA OF 159 BRONCHIAL ASTHMA PATIENTS, UNDERGOING THE NATUROPATHY AND YOGA PROGRAMME, WAS ANALYZED FOR FORCED VITAL CAPACITY, FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME AT THE END OF 1 SECOND, MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE ON ADMISSION, 11TH DAY, ON DISCHARGE AND ONCE IN THREE MONTHS FOR THREE YEARS. THE PAIRED SAMPLE T TEST RESULTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE FORCED VITAL CAPACITY AND FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME FROM THE DATE OF ADMISSION UP TO 6TH MONTH (P < 0.0035) POST BONFERRONI CORRECTION. MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FROM ADMISSION TILL THE DATE OF DISCHARGE (P < 0.0035) AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FROM ADMISSION TILL THE 36TH MONTH OF FOLLOW-UP (P < 0.0035), POST BONFERRONI CORRECTION. THIS VALIDATED THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF COMBINING NATUROPATHY AND YOGA FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA.	2014

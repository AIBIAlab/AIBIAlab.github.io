1 2118 182 THE EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICE ON GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND OTHER HEALTH PARAMETERS IN THE PREDIABETIC STATE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON GLYCEMIC CONTROL, LIPID PROFILES, BODY COMPOSITION AND BLOOD PRESSURE IN PEOPLE IN THE PRE-DIABETIC STATE. STUDIES ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA ON POPULATION GROUPS UNDER HIGH RISK FOR DIABETES, CALLED PREDIABETIC OR SUFFERING FROM METABOLIC SYNDROMES WERE EXTRACTED FROM A THOROUGH SEARCH OF PUBMED, SCOPUS, COCHRANE LIBRARY, EBSCO AND INDMED DATABASES. BOTH RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) AND NON-RCT STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IN THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. STUDIES PUBLISHED BETWEEN JAN 2002 AND DEC 2018 WERE INCLUDED. STUDIES WERE CONSIDERED FOR EVALUATION IF THEY INVESTIGATED A YOGA INTERVENTION TO PREVENT T2DM, AGAINST A CONTROL GROUP, WHILE ALSO REPORTING GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND OTHER HEALTH PARAMETERS OF T2DM MANAGEMENT. SUMMARY EFFECT SIZES AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CI) WERE CALCULATED USING THE COMPREHENSIVE META-ANALYSIS SOFTWARE IN ADDITION TO PUBLICATION BIAS. OF THE 46,500 IDENTIFIED STUDIES, 14 STUDIES WITH 834 PARTICIPANTS OF WHOM WERE 50% WOMEN, WERE FOUND TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION IN OUR SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OUR QUANTITATIVE SYNTHESIS INCLUDED 12 RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS AND 2 NON-RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS, WITH THE FOLLOW-UP PERIOD RANGING FROM 4 TO 52 WEEKS. COMPARED TO CONTROLS, YOGA INTERVENTION IMPROVED FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE (FBG) [STANDARD MEAN DIFFERENCE (SMD -0.064 MG/DL (95% CI -0.201 TO 0.074)]; LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (LDL) [SMD-0.090 MG/DL (95% CI -0.270 TO 0.090)]; TRIGLYCERIDES [SMD -0.148 MG/DL (95% CI -0.285 TO -0.012)]; TOTAL CHOLESTEROL [SMD -0.058 MG/DL (95% CI -0.220 TO 0.104)] AND SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE [SMD -0.058 MM HG (95% CI -0.168 TO 0.053)]. THIS META-ANALYSIS UNCOVERED CLINICALLY IMPROVED EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON GLYCEMIC CONTROL, LIPID PROFILES AND OTHER PARAMETERS OF T2DM MANAGEMENT IN PREDIABETIC POPULATION. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA INTERVENTION MAY BE CONSIDERED AS A COMPREHENSIVE AND ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO PREVENTING T2DM. FURTHER ADEQUATELY POWERED, WELL DESIGNED RCTS ARE NEEDED TO SUPPORT OUR FINDINGS AND INVESTIGATE THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA IN T2DM PATIENTS.	2019	

2 2594  64 YOGA FOR METABOLIC SYNDROME: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND METABOLIC SYNDROME IS THE MOST IMPORTANT RISK FACTOR FOR DEVELOPING CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND TYPE 2 DIABETES. THE AIM OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO SYSTEMATICALLY ASSESS AND PERFORM A META-ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON THE PARAMETERS OF METABOLIC SYNDROME. METHODS MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS AND INDMED WERE SEARCHED AND SCREENED FROM THEIR INCEPTION THROUGH TO 8 MARCH 2016 FOR RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS ON YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME. RISK OF BIAS WAS ASSESSED USING THE COCHRANE RISK OF BIAS TOOL. RESULTS SEVEN TRIALS WITH A TOTAL OF 794 PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED. NO EFFECTS OF YOGA ON RESOLUTION OF METABOLIC SYNDROME, DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE, TRIGLYCERIDES, HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL AND FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE WERE FOUND, BUT YOGA WAS SUPERIOR TO USUAL CARE FOR WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE (STANDARDISED MEAN DIFFERENCE (SMD) = -0.35; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) = -0.57 TO -0.13; P < 0.01) AND SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (SMD = -0.29; 95% CI = -0.51 TO -0.07; P = 0.01). HOWEVER, THESE EFFECTS WERE NOT ROBUST AGAINST SELECTION BIAS. NO INTERVENTION-RELATED ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSION BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THIS META-ANALYSIS, NO RECOMMENDATION CAN BE MADE FOR OR AGAINST YOGA IN ORDER TO INFLUENCE THE PARAMETERS OF METABOLIC SYNDROME. DESPITE METHODOLOGICAL DRAWBACKS, AND UNTIL FURTHER RESEARCH IS UNDERTAKEN, YOGA CAN BE PRELIMINARILY CONSIDERED AS A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR REDUCING WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE AND SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE IN INDIVIDUALS WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME WHO ARE NOT ADHERING TO CONVENTIONAL FORMS OF EXERCISE.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
3  221  58 A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF YOGA FOR HYPERTENSION. BACKGROUND: THE AIM OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS WAS TO EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE AND THE STRENGTH OF RECOMMENDATION FOR YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC MEANS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF PREHYPERTENSION AND HYPERTENSION. METHODS: MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, CENTRAL, AND INDMED WERE SCREENED THROUGH FEBRUARY 2014 FOR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS (>/=8 WEEKS) COMPARED WITH USUAL CARE OR ANY ACTIVE CONTROL INTERVENTION ON BLOOD PRESSURE IN PATIENTS WITH PREHYPERTENSION (120-139/80-89 MM HG) OR HYPERTENSION (>/=140/>/=90 MM HG). RISK OF BIAS WAS ASSESSED USING THE COCHRANE RISK OF BIAS TOOL; QUALITY OF EVIDENCE WAS ASSESSED ACCORDING TO THE GRADE RECOMMENDATIONS. RESULTS: SEVEN RCTS WITH A TOTAL OF 452 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED. COMPARED WITH USUAL CARE, VERY LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE WAS FOUND FOR EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SYSTOLIC (6 RCTS, N = 278; MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) = -9.65 MM HG, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) = -17.23 TO -2.06, P = 0.01; HETEROGENEITY: I (2) = 90%, CHI(2) = 48.21, P < 0.01) AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (6 RCTS, N = 278; MD = -7.22 MM HG, 95% CI = -12.83 TO -1.62, P = 0.01; HETEROGENEITY: I (2) = 92%, CHI(2) = 64.84, P < 0.01). SUBGROUP ANALYSES REVEALED EFFECTS FOR RCTS THAT INCLUDED HYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS BUT NOT FOR RCTS THAT INCLUDED BOTH HYPERTENSIVE AND PREHYPERTENSIVE PATIENTS, AS WELL AS FOR RCTS THAT ALLOWED ANTIHYPERTENSIVE COMEDICATION BUT NOT FOR THOSE THAT DID NOT. MORE ADVERSE EVENTS OCCURRED DURING YOGA THAN DURING USUAL CARE. COMPARED WITH EXERCISE, NO EVIDENCE WAS FOUND FOR EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SYSTOLIC OR DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE. CONCLUSIONS: LARGER STUDIES ARE REQUIRED TO CONFIRM THE EMERGING BUT LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE THAT YOGA MAY BE A USEFUL ADJUNCT INTERVENTION IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
4 2063  61 THE BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE COMPARED TO PHYSICAL EXERCISE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. YOGA IS INCREASINGLY USED AS AN ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE-2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM). THE PRESENT STUDY AIMS TO SYSTEMATICALLY EVALUATE THE LITERATURE AND PERFORM A META-ANALYSIS ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA PRACTICE COMPARED TO PHYSICAL EXERCISE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF T2DM. DATA WERE OBTAINED USING A STEPWISE SEARCH PROCESS USING KEYWORDS IN THE FOLLOWING ONLINE MEDICAL DATABASES; PUBMED, WEB OF SCIENCE AND SCOPUS. ALL CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS INVOLVING PATIENTS WITH T2DM, COMPARING YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION WITH PHYSICAL EXERCISE AND EVALUATING GLYCAEMIC CONTROL AND OTHER OUTCOMES BETWEEN THE INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. EIGHT STUDIES WERE ELIGIBLE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. IN TOTAL, 842 PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSIGNED TO A YOGA INTERVENTION OR A CONTROL GROUP WITH AN EXERCISE INTERVENTION AND THE AGE RANGE OF PARTICIPANTS WAS 30-78 YEARS. A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN FBG (15.16MG/DL), PPBG (28.66MG/DL), HBA1C (0.39%) AND BMI (0.71KG/M2) WAS NOTED IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP ('YOGA') COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP ('PHYSICAL EXERCISE') IN THE POOLED ANALYSIS. WE DID NOT OBSERVE ANY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS FOR LIPID PARAMETERS, OTHER BODY COMPOSITION MEASURES (WC AND WHR) AND BLOOD PRESSURE. IN CONCLUSION, OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT YOGA HAS BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON GLYCAEMIC CONTROL IN COMPARISON TO PHYSICAL EXERCISE IN T2DM HOWEVER, INDIVIDUAL STUDIES SHOWED CONSIDERABLE HETEROGENEITY. HENCE, FURTHER WELL-CONTROLLED RANDOMIZED TRIALS ARE REQUIRED PRIOR TO DRAWING CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF YOGA IN COMPARISON TO PHYSICAL EXERCISE.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
5 2171  51 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS AMONG PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM) IS A FASTEST EVOLVING METABOLIC DISORDER AND INDIA HOUSES SECOND HIGHEST NUMBER OF PATIENTS WITH DIABETES AFTER CHINA. CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES ARE THE MAJOR CAUSE OF MORTALITY AMONG PATIENTS WITH T2DM. YOGA IS AN ANCIENT INDIAN PRACTICE THAT PROVES TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR PATIENTS WITH DIABETES. THE PRESENT SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS HAS BEEN CONDUCTED TO SEE THE BENEFITS OF YOGA ON BLOOD PRESSURE, LIPID PROFILE, AND ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASURES AMONG PATIENTS WITH T2DM. THE ARTICLES WERE EXTRACTED FROM THREE DATABASES - PUBMED, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR. ONLY ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTICLES, WITH PEDRO SCORE>/=6, WERE INCLUDED IN THE CURRENT STUDY. THE DUPLICATES WERE REMOVED USING MENDELEY. FOURTEEN RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) AND THREE 3 NON-RCTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. THE META-ANALYSIS WAS DONE USING REVIEW MANAGER 5.3. THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT YOGA IS EFFECT IN IMPROVING BLOOD PRESSURE (P<0.01), LIPID PROFILE (P<0.01) EXCEPT HDL (P=0.06), AND ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASURES (P<0.01) EXCEPT WAIST-HIP RATIO (P=0.79). HETEROGENEITY WAS ALSO HIGH FOR MOST OF THE VARIABLES. IT MAY BE CONCLUDED FROM THE RESULTS THAT THE YOGA IS EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING OF BLOOD PRESSURE, LIPID PROFILE, AND ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASURES. HOWEVER, HIGH HETEROGENEITY SOUGHT THE NEED OF MORE HIGH QUALITY RCTS TO AFFIRM THESE FINDINGS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
6  223  49 A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON WEIGHT-RELATED OUTCOMES. INTRODUCTION: OVERWEIGHT AND OBESITY ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS FOR CHRONIC DISEASES AND PREMATURE DEATH. THE AIM OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO SYSTEMATICALLY ASSESS AND ANALYZE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON WEIGHT-RELATED OUTCOMES. METHODS: MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, AND THE COCHRANE LIBRARY WERE SCREENED THROUGH MARCH 2015 FOR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS ON YOGA FOR WEIGHT-RELATED OUTCOMES IN THE GENERAL POPULATION OR OVERWEIGHT/OBESE INDIVIDUALS. RISK OF BIAS WAS ASSESSED USING THE COCHRANE RISK OF BIAS TOOL ON THE FOLLOWING DOMAINS: SELECTION BIAS, PERFORMANCE BIAS, DETECTION BIAS, ATTRITION BIAS, REPORTING BIAS, AND OTHER BIAS. RESULTS: OUT OF 445 RECORDS IDENTIFIED DURING LITERATURE SEARCH, 30 TRIALS WITH A TOTAL OF 2173 PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED. NO EFFECTS ON WEIGHT, BODY MASS INDEX, BODY FAT PERCENTAGE OR WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE WERE FOUND. IN STUDIES WITH HEALTHY ADULT PARTICIPANTS AN EFFECT OF YOGA COMPARED TO USUAL CARE WAS FOUND REGARDING WAIST/HIP RATIO (SMD=--1.00; 95% CI=--1.44, -0.55; P<0.001). IN STUDIES WITH OVERWEIGHT/OBESE PARTICIPANTS ONLY, EFFECTS RELATIVE TO USUAL CARE WERE FOUND FOR BODY MASS INDEX (SMD=-0.99; 95% CI=-1.67, -0.31; P=0.004). EFFECTS HOWEVER WERE NOT ROBUST AGAINST SELECTION BIAS; AND PUBLICATION BIAS COULD NOT BE RULED OUT. NO INTERVENTION-RELATED ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS: DESPITE METHODOLOGICAL DRAWBACKS, YOGA CAN BE PRELIMINARILY CONSIDERED A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION TO REDUCE BODY MASS INDEX IN OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE INDIVIDUALS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
7 2539  57 YOGA FOR ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF CONTROLLED TRIALS. A GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE SUGGESTS YOGIC PRACTICES MAY BENEFIT ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES (DM2). IN THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW, WE EVALUATE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE FROM PROSPECTIVE CONTROLLED TRIALS REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA-BASED PROGRAMS ON SPECIFIC HEALTH OUTCOMES PERTINENT TO DM2 MANAGEMENT. TO IDENTIFY QUALIFYING STUDIES, WE SEARCHED NINE DATABASES AND SCANNED BIBLIOGRAPHIES OF RELEVANT REVIEW PAPERS AND ALL IDENTIFIED ARTICLES. CONTROLLED TRIALS THAT DID NOT TARGET ADULTS WITH DIABETES, INCLUDED ONLY ADULTS WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES, WERE UNDER TWO-WEEK DURATION, OR DID NOT INCLUDE QUANTITATIVE OUTCOME DATA WERE EXCLUDED. STUDY QUALITY WAS EVALUATED USING THE PEDRO SCALE. THIRTY-THREE PAPERS REPORTING FINDINGS FROM 25 CONTROLLED TRIALS (13 NONRANDOMIZED, 12 RANDOMIZED) MET OUR INCLUSION CRITERIA (N = 2170 PARTICIPANTS). COLLECTIVELY, FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGIC PRACTICES MAY PROMOTE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN SEVERAL INDICES OF IMPORTANCE IN DM2 MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING GLYCEMIC CONTROL, LIPID LEVELS, AND BODY COMPOSITION. MORE LIMITED DATA SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY ALSO LOWER OXIDATIVE STRESS AND BLOOD PRESSURE; ENHANCE PULMONARY AND AUTONOMIC FUNCTION, MOOD, SLEEP, AND QUALITY OF LIFE; AND REDUCE MEDICATION USE IN ADULTS WITH DM2. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS OF EXISTING STUDIES, ADDITIONAL HIGH-QUALITY INVESTIGATIONS ARE REQUIRED TO CONFIRM AND FURTHER ELUCIDATE THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA PROGRAMS IN POPULATIONS WITH DM2.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
8 2104  61 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON HEALTH-RELATED FITNESS AMONG PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: THERE IS A NEED FOR A TYPE OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THAT COULD ADDRESS THE CHALLENGING CYCLE OF PHYSICAL INACTIVITY, IMPAIRED HEALTH-RELATED FITNESS, AND TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM) CONDITIONS. YOGA COULD BE ONE TYPE OF EXERCISE TO OVERCOME THE BARRIERS TO ADHERE TO REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. THE CURRENT STUDY AIMED TO SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEW THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON HEALTH-RELATED FITNESS, INCLUDING CARDIORESPIRATORY FITNESS, MUSCLE STRENGTH, BODY COMPOSITION, BALANCE, AND FLEXIBILITY, AMONG PATIENTS WITH T2DM. METHODS: WE SYSTEMATICALLY SEARCHED FOUR DATABASES AND TWO REGISTRIES (PUBMED, SCOPUS, COCHRANE, EMBASE, WHO-ITCRP, AND CLINICALTRIALS.GOV) IN SEPTEMBER 2021, FOLLOWING A REGISTERED PROTOCOL ON PROSPERO (CRD42022276225). STUDY INCLUSION CRITERIA WERE T2DM PATIENTS WITH OR WITHOUT COMPLICATION, YOGA INTERVENTION AS A SINGLE COMPONENT OR AS A COMPLEMENT COMPARED TO OTHER KINDS OF EXERCISE OR AN INACTIVE CONTROL, HEALTH-RELATED FITNESS, AND A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL OR QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL WITH CONTROL GROUP DESIGN. THE ROBINS-I TOOL AND ROB 2.0 TOOL WERE USED TO ASSESS THE RISK OF BIAS IN THE INCLUDED STUDIES. A VOTE-COUNTING ANALYSIS AND META-ANALYSIS COMPUTED USING RANDOM EFFECTS' MODELS WERE CONDUCTED. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 10 RECORDS FROM 3 QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL AND 7 RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIALS WITH 815 PARTICIPANTS IN TOTAL WERE INCLUDED. THE META-ANALYSIS FAVORED YOGA GROUPS COMPARED TO INACTIVE CONTROLS IN IMPROVING MUSCLE STRENGTH BY 3.42 (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL 2.42 TO 4.43), REPETITIONS OF CHAIR STAND TEST, AND IMPROVING CARDIORESPIRATORY FITNESS BY 6.6% (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL 0.4 TO 12.8) IMPROVEMENT OF BASELINE FORCED VITAL CAPACITY. THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE FOR BOTH OUTCOMES WAS LOW. CONCLUSION: LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE FAVORED YOGA IN IMPROVING HEALTH-RELATED FITNESS, PARTICULARLY MUSCLE STRENGTH AND CARDIORESPIRATORY FITNESS, AMONG PATIENTS WITH T2DM. FUNDING: ALL AUTHORS IN THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW RECEIVED NO SPECIFIC GRANT FROM ANY FUNDING AGENCY IN THE PUBLIC, COMMERCIAL, OR NOT-FOR-PROFIT SECTORS.	2022	
                                                                                                                    
9 2617  60 YOGA FOR SECONDARY PREVENTION OF CORONARY HEART DISEASE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVES: YOGA HAS BEEN WIDELY PRACTICED AND HAS RECENTLY SHOWN BENEFITS IN PATIENTS WITH CORONARY HEART DISEASE (CHD), HOWEVER, EVIDENCE IS INCONSISTENT. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS BY SEARCHING PUBMED/MEDLINE, THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL), EMBASE AND WEB OF SCIENCE FROM INCEPTION TO MAY 31, 2020 FOR RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) COMPARING YOGA WITH USUAL CARE OR NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH CHD. THE PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY AND HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HR-QOL). SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE A COMPOSITE CARDIOVASCULAR OUTCOME, EXERCISE CAPACITY AND CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS (BLOOD PRESSURE, LIPID PROFILES AND BODY MASS INDEX). RESULTS: SEVEN RCTS WITH A TOTAL OF 4671 PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED. SIX RCTS COMPARED YOGA WITH USUAL CARE AND ONE COMPARED YOGA WITH DESIGNED EXERCISE. THE MEAN AGE OF THE PARTICIPANTS RANGED FROM 51.0-60.7 YEARS AND THE MAJORITY OF THEM WERE MEN (85.4 %). POOLED RESULTS SHOWED THAT COMPARED WITH USUAL CARE, YOGA HAD NO EFFECT ON ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY (RR, 1.02; 95 % CI, 0.75-1.39), BUT IT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED HR-QOL (SMD, 0.07; 95 % CI, 0.01 - 0.14). A NON-SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF THE COMPOSITE CARDIOVASCULAR OUTCOME WAS OBSERVED (133 VS. 154; RR, 0.63; 95 % CI, 0.15-2.59). SERUM LEVEL OF TRIGLYCERIDE AND HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL, BLOOD PRESSURE AND BODY MASS INDEX WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED. THE STUDY COMPARING YOGA WITH CONTROL EXERCISE ALSO REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER EFFECTS OF YOGA ON HR-QOL (85.75 VS. 75.24, P < 0.001). NO SEVERE ADVERSE EVENTS RELATED TO YOGA WERE REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA MIGHT BE A PROMISING ALTERNATIVE FOR PATIENTS WITH CHD AS IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE, LESS NUMBER OF COMPOSITE CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS, AND IMPROVED CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
10  231  38 A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF YOGA FOR HEART DISEASE. BACKGROUND: THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) AIMED TO EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE AND THE STRENGTH OF RECOMMENDATION FOR YOGA AS AN ANCILLARY INTERVENTION FOR HEART DISEASE. METHODS: MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, AND INDMED WERE SEARCHED UP TO OCTOBER 2013. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES WERE MORTALITY, NONFATAL CARDIAC EVENTS, EXERCISE CAPACITY, HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, AND MODIFIABLE CARDIAC RISK FACTORS. RISK OF BIAS, QUALITY OF EVIDENCE, AND THE STRENGTH OF THE RECOMMENDATION FOR OR AGAINST YOGA WERE ASSESSED ACCORDING TO THE COCHRANE COLLABORATION AND GRADE RECOMMENDATIONS. RESULTS: SEVEN RCTS WITH 624 PATIENTS COMPARING YOGA TO USUAL CARE WERE INCLUDED. FOR CORONARY HEART DISEASE (FOUR RCTS), THERE WAS VERY LOW EVIDENCE FOR NO EFFECT ON MORTALITY, FOR A REDUCED NUMBER OF ANGINA EPISODES, AND FOR INCREASED EXERCISE CAPACITY, AND LOW EVIDENCE FOR REDUCED MODIFIABLE CARDIAC RISK FACTORS. FOR HEART FAILURE (TWO RCTS), THERE WAS VERY LOW EVIDENCE FOR NO EFFECT ON MORTALITY, AND LOW EVIDENCE FOR INCREASED EXERCISE CAPACITY, AND FOR NO EFFECT ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE. FOR CARDIAC DYSRHYTHMIAS TREATED WITH IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER-DEFIBRILLATOR (ONE RCT), THERE WAS VERY LOW EVIDENCE FOR NO EFFECT ON MORTALITY, AND FOR IMPROVED QUALITY, AND LOW EVIDENCE FOR EFFECTS ON NONFATAL DEVICE-TREATED VENTRICULAR EVENTS. THREE RCTS REPORTED SAFETY DATA AND REPORTED THAT NO ADVERSE EVENTS OCCURRED. CONCLUSIONS: BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THIS REVIEW, WEAK RECOMMENDATIONS CAN BE MADE FOR THE ANCILLARY USE OF YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH CORONARY HEART DISEASE, HEART FAILURE, AND CARDIAC DYSRHYTHMIA AT THIS POINT.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
11  355  44 ASSOCIATED FACTORS AND CONSEQUENCES OF RISK OF BIAS IN RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS OF YOGA: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. BACKGROUND: BIAS IN RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) OF COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY INTERVENTIONS SEEMS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC FACTORS AND TO POTENTIALLY DISTORT THE STUDIES' CONCLUSIONS. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW ASSESSED ASSOCIATED FACTORS OF RISK OF BIAS AND CONSEQUENCES FOR THE STUDIES' CONCLUSIONS IN RCTS OF YOGA AS ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY USED COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES. METHODS: MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, INDMED AND THE COCHRANE LIBRARY WERE SEARCHED THROUGH FEBRUARY 2014 FOR YOGA RCTS. RISK OF SELECTION BIAS WAS ASSESSED USING THE COCHRANE TOOL AND REGRESSED TO A) PUBLICATION YEAR; B) COUNTRY OF ORIGIN; C) JOURNAL TYPE; AND D) IMPACT FACTOR USING MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS. LIKEWISE, THE AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS WERE REGRESSED TO RISK OF BIAS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 312 RCTS WERE INCLUDED. IMPACT FACTOR RANGED FROM 0.0 TO 39.2 (MEDIAN = 1.3); 60 RCT (19.2%) HAD A LOW RISK OF SELECTION BIAS, AND 252 (80.8%) HAD A HIGH OR UNCLEAR RISK OF SELECTION BIAS. ONLY PUBLICATION YEAR AND IMPACT FACTOR SIGNIFICANTLY PREDICTED LOW RISK OF BIAS; RCTS PUBLISHED AFTER 2001 (ADJUSTED ODDS RATIO (OR) = 12.6; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) = 1.7, 94.0; P<0.001) AND THOSE PUBLISHED IN JOURNALS WITH IMPACT FACTOR (ADJUSTED OR = 2.6; 95%CI = 1.4, 4.9; P = 0.004) WERE MORE LIKELY TO HAVE LOW RISK OF BIAS. THE AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS WERE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH RISK OF BIAS. CONCLUSIONS: RISK OF SELECTION BIAS WAS GENERALLY HIGH IN RCTS OF YOGA; ALTHOUGH THE SITUATION HAS IMPROVED SINCE THE PUBLICATION OF THE REVISED CONSORT STATEMENT 2001. PRE-CONSORT RCTS AND THOSE PUBLISHED IN JOURNALS WITHOUT IMPACT FACTOR SHOULD BE HANDLED WITH INCREASED CARE; ALTHOUGH RISK OF BIAS IS UNLIKELY TO DISTORT THE RCTS' CONCLUSIONS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
12 2144  45 THE EFFECTS OF MEDITATION, YOGA, AND MINDFULNESS ON DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND STRESS IN TERTIARY EDUCATION STUDENTS: A META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: MEDITATION, YOGA, AND MINDFULNESS ARE POPULAR INTERVENTIONS AT UNIVERSITIES AND TERTIARY EDUCATION INSTITUTES TO IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH. HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS ON DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND STRESS ARE UNCLEAR. THIS STUDY ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF MEDITATION, YOGA, AND MINDFULNESS ON SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND STRESS IN TERTIARY EDUCATION STUDENTS. METHODS: WE SEARCHED COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL), PUBMED, PSYCINFO AND IDENTIFIED 11,936 ARTICLES. AFTER RETRIEVING 181 PAPERS FOR FULL-TEXT SCREENING, 24 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE INCLUDED IN THE QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS. WE CONDUCTED A RANDOM-EFFECTS META-ANALYSIS AMONGST 23 STUDIES WITH 1,373 PARTICIPANTS. RESULTS: AT POST-TEST, AFTER EXCLUSION OF OUTLIERS, EFFECT SIZES FOR DEPRESSION, G = 0.42 (95% CI: 0.16-0.69), ANXIETY G = 0.46 (95% CI: 0.34-0.59), STRESS G = 0.42 (95% CI: 0.27-0.57) WERE MODERATE. HETEROGENEITY WAS LOW (I (2) = 6%). WHEN COMPARED TO ACTIVE CONTROL, THE EFFECT DECREASED TO G = 0.13 (95% CI: -0.18-0.43). NO RCT REPORTED ON SAFETY, ONLY TWO STUDIES REPORTED ON ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT, MOST STUDIES HAD A HIGH RISK OF BIAS. CONCLUSIONS: MOST STUDIES WERE OF POOR QUALITY AND RESULTS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION. OVERALL MODERATE EFFECTS WERE FOUND WHICH DECREASED SUBSTANTIALLY WHEN INTERVENTIONS WERE COMPARED TO ACTIVE CONTROL. IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER MEDITATION, YOGA OR MINDFULNESS AFFECT ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OR AFFECT HAVE ANY NEGATIVE SIDE EFFECTS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
13 2178  40 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PAIN, MOBILITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVE. TO SYSTEMATICALLY ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PAIN, MOBILITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS. METHODS. PUBMED, MEDLINE, EMBASE, THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS, PHYSIOTHERAPY EVIDENCE DATABASE (PEDRO), AND OTHER SOURCES WERE SEARCHED SYSTEMATICALLY IN THIS STUDY. TWO REVIEWERS IDENTIFIED ELIGIBLE STUDIES AND EXTRACTED DATA INDEPENDENTLY. DOWNS AND BLACK'S QUALITY INDEX WERE USED TO EVALUATE THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES. RESULTS. A TOTAL OF 9 ARTICLES (6 STUDIES) INVOLVING 372 PATIENTS WITH KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. THE MOST COMMON YOGA PROTOCOL IS 40~90 MINUTES/SESSION, LASTING FOR AT LEAST 8 WEEKS. THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON PAIN RELIEF AND FUNCTION IMPROVEMENT COULD BE SEEN AFTER TWO-WEEK INTERVENTION. CONCLUSION. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW SHOWED THAT YOGA MIGHT HAVE POSITIVE EFFECTS IN RELIEVING PAIN AND MOBILITY ON PATIENTS WITH KOA, BUT THE EFFECTS ON QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) ARE UNCLEAR. BESIDES, MORE OUTCOME MEASURE RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH OF YOGA EFFECTS ON PEOPLE WITH KOA SHOULD BE CONDUCTED.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
14 2098  51 THE EFFECT OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. BACKGROUND: WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER (BC) ARE LIVING LONGER WITH DEBILITATING SIDE EFFECTS SUCH AS CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (CRF) THAT AFFECT OVERALL WELL-BEING. YOGA PROMOTES HEALTH, WELL-BEING AND MAY BE BENEFICIAL IN REDUCING CRF. ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN PREVIOUS SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND META-ANALYSES, THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CRF AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) REMAIN UNCLEAR, PARTICULARLY IN COMPARISON WITH OTHER TYPES OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (PA). OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO CARRY OUT A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CRF AND QOL IN WOMEN WITH BC. METHODS: ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE SEARCHED (MEDLINE, EMBASE CLASSIC+EMBASE AND EMB REVIEWS, COCHRANE CENTRAL CT) FROM INCEPTION TO MAY 2018. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE INCLUDED IF THEY WERE FULL TEXT, IN ENGLISH, INCLUDED A YOGA INTERVENTION, A COMPARATOR (INCLUDING NON-PA USUAL CARE OR ALTERNATE PA INTERVENTION), AND REPORTED ON CRF OR QOL. EFFECTS OF YOGA WERE POOLED USING STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE (SMD) VIA A RANDOM EFFECTS MODEL. RESULTS: OF THE 2468 RECORDS RETRIEVED, 24 TRIALS WERE INCLUDED; 18 STUDIES COMPARED YOGA TO A NON-PA COMPARATOR AND 6 TO A PA COMPARATOR. YOGA DEMONSTRATED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN CRF OVER NON-PA (SMD -0.30 [-0.51; -0.08]) BUT NOT PA (SMD -0.17 [-0.50; 0.17]) COMPARATORS. ADDITIONALLY, YOGA DEMONSTRATED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN QOL OVER NON-PA (SMD -0.27 [-0.46; -0.07]) BUT NOT PA (SMD 0.04 [-0.22; +0.31]) COMPARATORS. DISCUSSION: THIS META-ANALYSIS FOUND THAT YOGA PROVIDES SMALL TO MEDIUM IMPROVEMENTS IN CRF AND QOL COMPARED TO NON-PA, BUT NOT IN COMPARISON TO OTHER PA INTERVENTIONS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
15  811  49 EFFECT OF YOGA ON BLOOD PRESSURE IN PREHYPERTENSION: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. INTRODUCTION: PREHYPERTENSION IS A PRECURSOR FOR DEVELOPING HYPERTENSION AND IS A RISK FACTOR FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES. YOGA THERAPY MAY HAVE A ROLE IN LOWERING THE BLOOD PRESSURES IN PREHYPERTENSION AND HYPERTENSION. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AIMS TO SYNTHESIZE THE AVAILABLE LITERATURE FOR THE SAME. METHODOLOGY. DATABASES SUCH AS PUBMED, EMBASE, SCOPUS, AND WEB OF SCIENCE WERE SEARCHED FOR RANDOMISED CONTROL TRIALS ONLY IN THE TIME DURATION OF 2010-2021. THE MAIN OUTCOME OF INTEREST WAS SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURES. ARTICLES WERE SCREENED BASED ON THE INCLUSION CRITERIA, AND 8 ARTICLES WERE RECRUITED FOR THE REVIEW. META-ANALYSIS WAS DONE FOR SUITABLE ARTICLES. REVMAN 5.4 BY COCHRANE WAS USED FOR META-ANALYSIS AND FOREST PLOT CONSTRUCTION. RISK OF BIAS WAS DETERMINED USING THE DOWNS AND BLACK CHECKLIST BY THREE INDEPENDENT AUTHORS. RESULTS: THE META-ANALYSIS OF THE ARTICLES FAVOURED YOGA INTERVENTION OVER THE CONTROL INTERVENTION. YOGA THERAPY HAD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE SYSTOLIC PRESSURE (-0.62 STANDARD MEAN DIFFERENCE, AT IV FIXED 95% CI: -0.83, -0.41) AND DIASTOLIC PRESSURE (-0.81 STANDARD MEAN DIFFERENCE, AT IV RANDOM 95% CI: -1.39, -0.22). SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES STUDIED WERE HEART RATE, WEIGHT, BMI, WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE, AND LIPID PROFILE. THE MAIN PROTOCOL OF YOGA THERAPY INCLUDED POSTURES, BREATHING EXERCISES, AND DIFFERENT MEDITATION TECHNIQUES. A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SECONDARY OUTCOMES WAS OBSERVED, EXCEPT FOR HDL VALUES IN LIPID PROFILE WHICH SHOWED A GRADUAL INCREASE IN YOGA GROUP IN COMPARISON WITH ALTERNATIVE THERAPY. CONCLUSION: YOGA THERAPY HAS SHOWN TO BE SIGNIFICANT IN THE REDUCTION OF SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC PRESSURE IN PREHYPERTENSIVE POPULATION. SUPPORTING EVIDENCE LACKS IN PROVIDING A PROPER STRUCTURED DOSAGE OF YOGA ASANAS AND BREATHING TECHNIQUES. CONSIDERING THE EXISTING LITERATURE AND EVIDENCE, YOGA THERAPY CAN BE USED AND RECOMMENDED IN PREHYPERTENSIVE POPULATION AND CAN BE BENEFICIAL IN REDUCING THE CHANCES OF DEVELOPING HYPERTENSION OR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                              
16 1910  61 RISK INDICES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INSULIN RESISTANCE SYNDROME, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, AND POSSIBLE PROTECTION WITH YOGA: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVE: TO CONDUCT A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF PUBLISHED LITERATURE REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA, A PROMISING MIND-BODY THERAPY, ON SPECIFIC ANTHROPOMETRIC AND PHYSIOLOGIC INDICES OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (CVD) RISK AND ON RELATED CLINICAL ENDPOINTS. METHODS: WE PERFORMED A LITERATURE SEARCH USING 4 COMPUTERIZED ENGLISH AND INDIAN SCIENTIFIC DATABASES. THE SEARCH WAS RESTRICTED TO ORIGINAL STUDIES (1970 TO 2004) EVALUATING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CVD OR INDICES OF CVD RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE INSULIN RESISTANCE SYNDROME (IRS). RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS), NONRANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS, UNCONTROLLED (PRE AND POST) CLINICAL TRIALS, AND CROSS-SECTIONAL (OBSERVATIONAL) STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IF THEY MET SPECIFIC CRITERIA. DATA WERE EXTRACTED REGARDING STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, POPULATION SIZE AND CHARACTERISTICS, INTERVENTION TYPE AND DURATION, COMPARISON GROUP OR CONDITION, OUTCOME ASSESSMENT, DATA ANALYSIS AND PRESENTATION, FOLLOW-UP, AND KEY RESULTS, AND THE QUALITY OF EACH STUDY WAS EVALUATED ACCORDING TO SPECIFIC PREDETERMINED CRITERIA. RESULTS: WE IDENTIFIED 70 ELIGIBLE STUDIES, INCLUDING 1 OBSERVATIONAL STUDY, 26 UNCONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS, 21 NONRANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS, AND 22 RCTS. TOGETHER, THE REPORTED RESULTS OF THESE STUDIES INDICATE BENEFICIAL CHANGES OVERALL IN SEVERAL IRS-RELATED INDICES OF CVD RISK, INCLUDING GLUCOSE TOLERANCE AND INSULIN SENSITIVITY, LIPID PROFILES, ANTHROPOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS, BLOOD PRESSURE, OXIDATIVE STRESS, COAGULATION PROFILES, SYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION, AND CARDIOVAGAL FUNCTION, AS WELL AS IMPROVEMENT IN SEVERAL CLINICAL ENDPOINTS. CONCLUSIONS: COLLECTIVELY, THESE STUDIES SUGGEST THAT YOGA MAY REDUCE MANY IRS-RELATED RISK FACTORS FOR CVD, MAY IMPROVE CLINICAL OUTCOMES, AND MAY AID IN THE MANAGEMENT OF CVD AND OTHER IRS-RELATED CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, THE METHODOLOGIC AND OTHER LIMITATIONS CHARACTERIZING MOST OF THESE STUDIES PRECLUDE DRAWING FIRM CONCLUSIONS. ADDITIONAL HIGH QUALITY RCTS ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM AND FURTHER ELUCIDATE THE EFFECTS OF STANDARDIZED YOGA PROGRAMS ON SPECIFIC INDICES OF CVD RISK AND RELATED CLINICAL ENDPOINTS.	2005	
                                        
17  834  54 EFFECT OF YOGA ON OXIDATIVE STRESS IN TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: DIABETES MELLITUS HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON PUBLIC HEALTH. OXIDATIVE STRESS PLAYS A MAJOR ROLE IN THE PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM), LEADING TO VARIOUS COMPLICATIONS OF T2DM. YOGA IS BEING WIDELY USED IN THE MANAGEMENT OF T2DM. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS IS TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON OXIDATIVE STRESS PARAMETERS AMONG ADULT PATIENTS DIAGNOSED WITH T2DM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ELECTRONIC DATABASES SUCH AS PUBMED, SCOPUS, COCHRANE LIBRARY AND SCIENCE DIRECT FROM START OF THE STUDY TILL MARCH 2020 WERE SEARCHED TO OBTAIN ELIGIBLE STUDIES. STUDY DESIGNS OF ALL NATURE WERE INCLUDED (EXCEPT CASE STUDIES AND REVIEWS). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS MALONDIALDEHYDE (MDA) AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE, HBA1C AND SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE (SOD) LEVELS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF FOUR TRIALS WITH A TOTAL OF 440 PATIENTS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. THE RESULTS OF META-ANALYSIS INDICATED THAT YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED MDA (SMD: -1.4; 95% CI -2.66 TO -0.13; P = 0.03; I2 = 97%), FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE LEVELS (SMD: -1.87: 95% CI -3.83 TO -0.09; P = 0.06; I2= 99%), AND HBA1C (SMD: -1.92; 95% CI - 3.03 TO -0.81; P = 0.0007; I2 = 92%) IN PATIENTS WITH T2DM. NO SUCH EFFECT WAS FOUND FOR SOD (SMD: -1.01; 95% CI -4.41 TO 2.38; P = 0.56; I2= 99%). CONCLUSION: THE AVAILABLE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT YOGA REDUCES MDA, FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE AND HBA1C, AND THUS WOULD BE BENEFICIAL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF T2DM AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY. HOWEVER, CONSIDERING THE LIMITED NUMBER OF STUDIES AND ITS HETEROGENEITY, FURTHER ROBUST STUDIES ARE NECESSARY TO STRENGTHEN OUR FINDINGS AND INVESTIGATE THE LONG-TERM BENEFITS OF YOGA.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
18 2742  57 YOGA PRACTICE FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE II DIABETES MELLITUS IN ADULTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. THE EFFECT OF PRACTICING YOGA FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE II DIABETES WAS ASSESSED IN THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW THROUGH SEARCHING RELATED ELECTRONIC DATABASES AND THE GREY LITERATURE TO THE END OF MAY 2007 USING OVID. ALL RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS (RCTS) COMPARING YOGA PRACTICE WITH OTHER TYPE OF INTERVENTION OR WITH REGULAR PRACTICE OR BOTH, WERE INCLUDED REGARDLESS OF LANGUAGE OR TYPE OF PUBLICATION. EACH STUDY WAS ASSESSED FOR QUALITY BY TWO INDEPENDENT REVIEWERS. MEAN DIFFERENCE WAS USED FOR SUMMARIZING THE EFFECT OF EACH STUDY OUTCOMES WITH 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS. POOLING OF THE STUDIES DID NOT TAKE PLACE DUE TO THE WIDE CLINICAL VARIATION BETWEEN THE STUDIES. PUBLICATION BIAS WAS ASSESSED BY STATISTICAL METHODS. FIVE TRIALS WITH 363 PARTICIPANTS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA WITH MEDIUM TO HIGH RISK OF BIAS AND DIFFERENT INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS. THE STUDIES' RESULTS SHOW IMPROVEMENT IN OUTCOMES AMONG PATIENTS WITH DIABETES TYPE II. THESE IMPROVEMENTS WERE MAINLY AMONG SHORT TERM OR IMMEDIATE DIABETES OUTCOMES AND NOT ALL WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. THE RESULTS WERE INCONCLUSIVE AND NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR THE LONG-TERM OUTCOMES. NO ADVERSE EFFECTS WERE REPORTED IN ANY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES. SHORT-TERM BENEFITS FOR PATIENTS WITH DIABETES MAY BE ACHIEVED FROM PRACTICING YOGA. FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED IN THIS AREA. FACTORS LIKE QUALITY OF THE TRIALS AND OTHER METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES SHOULD BE IMPROVED BY LARGE RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS WITH ALLOCATION CONCEALMENT TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA ON DIABETES TYPE II. A DEFINITIVE RECOMMENDATION FOR PHYSICIANS TO ENCOURAGE THEIR PATIENTS TO PRACTICE YOGA CANNOT BE REACHED AT PRESENT.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
19 1924  56 ROLE OF YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH TYPE II DIABETES MELLITUS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE AND EFFICACY OF YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS, THIS META-ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED. ELECTRONIC DATA BASES SEARCHED WERE PUBMED/MEDLINE, PROQUEST, PSYCINFO, INDMED, CENTRAL, COCHRANE LIBRARY, CAMQUEST AND CAMBASE TILL DECEMBER 17, 2014. ELIGIBLE OUTCOMES WERE FASTING BLOOD SUGAR (FBS), POST PRANDIAL BLOOD SUGAR (PPBS) AND GLYCOSYLATED HAEMOGLOBIN (HBA1C). RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS AND CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE ELIGIBLE. STUDIES FOCUSSING ONLY ON RELAXATION OR MEDITATION OR MULTIMODAL INTERVENTION WERE NOT INCLUDED. A TOTAL OF 17 RCTS WERE INCLUDED FOR REVIEW. DATA FROM RESEARCH ARTICLES ON PATIENTS, METHODS, INTERVENTIONS- CONTROL AND RESULTS WERE EXTRACTED. MEAN AND STANDARD DEVIATIONS WERE UTILIZED FOR CALCULATING STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE WITH 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL. HETEROGENEITY WAS ASSESSED WITH THE HELP OF I(2) STATISTICS. CHI(2) WAS USED TO RULE OUT THE EFFECTS OF HETEROGENEITY DUE TO CHANCE ALONE. BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA AS AN ADD-ON INTERVENTION TO STANDARD TREATMENT IN COMPARISON TO STANDARD TREATMENT WERE OBSERVED FOR FBS [STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE (SMD) -1.40, 95%CI -1.90 TO -0.90, P<0.00001]; PPBS [SMD -0.91, 95%CI -1.34 TO -0.48, P<0.0001] AS WELL AS HBA1C [SMD -0.64, 95%CI -0.97 TO -0.30, P<0.0002]. BUT RISK OF BIAS WAS OVERALL HIGH FOR INCLUDED STUDIES. WITH THIS AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, YOGA CAN BE CONSIDERED AS ADD-ON INTERVENTION FOR MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
20 2612  43 YOGA FOR RHEUMATIC DISEASES: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE AND THE STRENGTH OF RECOMMENDATION FOR YOGA AS AN ANCILLARY INTERVENTION IN RHEUMATIC DISEASES. METHODS: MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY AND INDMED WERE SEARCHED THROUGH FEBRUARY 2013. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) COMPARING YOGA WITH CONTROL INTERVENTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH RHEUMATIC DISEASES WERE INCLUDED. TWO AUTHORS INDEPENDENTLY ASSESSED THE RISK OF BIAS USING THE COCHRANE BACK REVIEW GROUP RISK OF BIAS TOOL. THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE AND THE STRENGTH OF THE RECOMMENDATION FOR OR AGAINST YOGA WERE GRADED ACCORDING TO THE GRADE RECOMMENDATIONS. RESULTS: EIGHT RCTS WITH A TOTAL OF 559 SUBJECTS WERE INCLUDED; TWO RCTS HAD A LOW RISK OF BIAS. IN TWO RCTS ON FM SYNDROME, THERE WAS VERY LOW EVIDENCE FOR EFFECTS ON PAIN AND LOW EVIDENCE FOR EFFECTS ON DISABILITY. IN THREE RCTS ON OA, THERE WAS VERY LOW EVIDENCE FOR EFFECTS ON PAIN AND DISABILITY. BASED ON TWO RCTS, VERY LOW EVIDENCE WAS FOUND FOR EFFECTS ON PAIN IN RA. NO EVIDENCE FOR EFFECTS ON PAIN WAS FOUND IN ONE RCT ON CTS. NO RCT EXPLICITLY REPORTED SAFETY DATA. CONCLUSION: BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THIS REVIEW, ONLY WEAK RECOMMENDATIONS CAN BE MADE FOR THE ANCILLARY USE OF YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF FM SYNDROME, OA AND RA AT THIS POINT.	2013

1 1225 151 FEASIBILITY AND EFFECTS OF A CHAIR-BASED YOGA PROGRAM FOR ADULTS WITH NEURODISABILITY. PURPOSE: THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON EXPLORING THE FEASIBILITY AND THE EFFECTS OF PRACTICING CHAIR-BASED YOGA FOR 10 WEEKS ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) AND INTEROCEPTIVE BODY AWARENESS (BA) IN ADULTS WITH NEURODISABILITY AND MODERATE TO SEVERE PHYSICAL DEPENDENCE.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A PRE- AND POST-TESTING CONTROL GROUP DESIGN WAS FOLLOWED. PARTICIPANTS WERE 34 SERVICE USERS AT A REHABILITATION CENTER. THE INTERVENTION GROUP (IG, N = 17, 53% MEN, MEAN AGE OF 48.6 +/- 11.4 YEARS) TOOK PART IN THE 10-WEEK CHAIR-BASED YOGA PROGRAM. THE CONTROL GROUP (CG, N = 17, 53% MEN, MEAN AGE OF 53.1 +/- 11.0 YEARS) RECEIVED USUAL CARE. THE OUTCOME MEASURES WERE FEASIBILITY (RECRUITMENT RATE, ATTRITION, COMPLETION RATE, ADHERENCE, PARTICIPATION, SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY), HRQOL (WHOQOL-BREF QUESTIONNAIRE), AND BA (THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL ASSESSMENT OF INTEROCEPTIVE AWARENESS, MAIA). PARTICIPANTS IN THE IG COMPLETED A QUESTIONNAIRE TO MEASURE THEIR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY PROVIDES IMPLICATIONS FOR A 10-WEEK CHAIR-BASED YOGA PROGRAM AS A FEASIBLE, WELL-TOLERATED, AND SAFE INTERVENTION, REINFORCED BY THE PARTICIPANTS' RETROSPECTIVE JUDGMENT. COMPARED TO THE CG, THE PROGRAM PRODUCED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS OVER BA, SUCH AS SUBSCALES OF MAIA NOTICING (P = .031, HEDGES GS = 0.76), EMOTIONAL AWARENESS (P < .001, HEDGES GS = 1.68), AND TRUSTING (P = .036, HEDGES GS = 0.74), BUT NOT HRQOL, FOR THE IG. CHAIR-BASED YOGA PROGRAMS COULD BE A REHABILITATION STRATEGY IN THE SOCIO-HEALTH CARE OF A VARIED POPULATION WITH PHYSICAL MOBILITY IMPAIRMENTS LEADING TO WHEELCHAIR USE.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONA 10-WEEK CHAIR-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION WAS SHOWN TO BE A FEASIBLE, WELL-TOLERATED, AND SAFE THERAPY WHICH ALLOWED PEOPLE OF VARYING ABILITIES TO PARTICIPATE EQUITABLE.CHAIR-BASED YOGA CAN HELP PEOPLE WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE PHYSICAL DEPENDENCE DUE TO NEURODISABILITY TO IMPROVE THEIR INTEROCEPTIVE BODY AWARENESS.CHAIR-BASED YOGA DOES NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE OF THIS SAMPLE OF PARTICIPANTS.	2021	

2 2602  33 YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH EARLY BREAST CANCER AND ITS IMPACT ON QUALITY OF LIFE - A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. THE AIM OF THIS PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON NEWLY DIAGNOSED PATIENTS WITH EARLY BREAST CANCER IN THE IMMEDIATE POSTOPERATIVE PHASE. 93 WOMEN NEWLY DIAGNOSED WITH EARLY BREAST CANCER WERE RANDOMIZED INTO AN INTERVENTION GROUP (IG) AND A CONTROL GROUP (WAITING GROUP, WG). THE IG STARTED YOGA IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE OPERATION. THE WG STARTED YOGA 5 WEEKS AFTER SURGERY. BOTH GROUPS ATTENDED YOGA CLASSES TWICE WEEKLY FOR 5 WEEKS. QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) WAS EVALUATED USING THE EORTC QLQ-C30 AND EORTC QLQ-BR23 QUESTIONNAIRES BEFORE THE INTERVENTION, IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE OPERATION AND AFTER 3 MONTHS. AFTER 3 MONTHS THE PATIENTS WERE ASKED WHETHER YOGA IMPROVED THEIR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND WHETHER THEY WISHED TO CONTINUE WITH YOGA. THE OVERALL QOL (P = 0.002) AND THE FUNCTIONAL STATUS (P = 0.005) INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE IG, WHILE PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS DECREASED OVER TIME IN BOTH GROUPS. 86 % OF PATIENTS IN THE IG AND ONLY 59 % OF PATIENTS IN THE WG (P = 0.04) CONFIRMED A POSITIVE CHANGE IN THEIR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THROUGH YOGA. MORE WOMEN IN THE IG INTENDED TO CONTINUE WITH YOGA (P = 0.03). EARLY INITIATION OF YOGA AS A SUPPORTIVE TREATMENT IN CANCER HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON QOL. TEACHING YOGA ALLOWED PATIENTS TO PRACTICE YOGA BY THEMSELVES, ENHANCED THE PATIENTS' QOL AND WAS FOUND TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
3 2529  35 YOGA EFFECTIVELY REDUCES FATIGUE AND SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION IN PATIENTS WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF CANCER. PURPOSE: EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF AN 8-WEEK YOGA THERAPY ON FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH DIFFERENT TYPES OF CANCER. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 173 CANCER PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM MILD TO SEVERE FATIGUE WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO YOGA INTERVENTION (N = 84) (IG) VERSUS WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (CG) (N = 88). YOGA THERAPY CONSISTED OF EIGHT WEEKLY SESSIONS WITH 60 MIN EACH. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS SELF-REPORTED FATIGUE SYMPTOMS. SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). DATA WERE ASSESSED USING QUESTIONNAIRES BEFORE (T0) AND AFTER YOGA THERAPY FOR IG VERSUS WAITING PERIOD FOR CG (T1). RESULTS: A STRONGER REDUCTION OF GENERAL FATIGUE (P = .033), PHYSICAL FATIGUE (P = .048), AND DEPRESSION (P < .001) AS WELL AS A STRONGER INCREASE IN QOL (P = .002) WAS FOUND FOR PATIENTS WHO ATTENDED 7 OR 8 SESSIONS COMPARED WITH CONTROLS. WITHIN THE YOGA GROUP, BOTH HIGHER ATTENDANCE RATE AND LOWER T0-FATIGUE WERE SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS OF LOWER T1-FATIGUE (P </= .001). EXPLORATORY RESULTS REVEALED THAT WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER REPORT A HIGHER REDUCTION OF FATIGUE THAN WOMEN WITH OTHER TYPES OF CANCER (P = .016) AFTER YOGA THERAPY. CONCLUSION: THE FINDINGS SUPPORT THE ASSUMPTION THAT YOGA THERAPY IS USEFUL TO REDUCE CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE, ESPECIALLY FOR THE PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF FATIGUE. WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER SEEM TO BENEFIT MOST, AND HIGHER ATTENDANCE RATE RESULTS IN GREATER REDUCTION OF FATIGUE.

4 1194  32 EXAMINING MEDIATORS AND MODERATORS OF YOGA FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY. HYPOTHESIS THIS STUDY EXAMINES MODERATORS AND MEDIATORS OF A YOGA INTERVENTION TARGETING QUALITY-OF-LIFE (QOL) OUTCOMES IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER RECEIVING RADIOTHERAPY.METHODS WOMEN UNDERGOING 6 WEEKS OF RADIOTHERAPY WERE RANDOMIZED TO A YOGA (YG; N = 53) OR STRETCHING (ST; N = 56) INTERVENTION OR A WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (WL; N = 54). DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND SLEEP DISTURBANCES WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE. MEDIATOR (POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS SYMPTOMS, BENEFIT FINDING, AND CORTISOL SLOPE) AND OUTCOME (36-ITEM SHORT FORM [SF]-36 MENTAL AND PHYSICAL COMPONENT SCALES [MCS AND PCS]) VARIABLES WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE, END-OF-TREATMENT, AND 1-, 3-, AND 6-MONTHS POSTTREATMENT. RESULTS BASELINE DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (P = .03) AND SLEEP DISTURBANCES (P < .01) MODERATED THE GROUP X TIME EFFECT ON MCS, BUT NOT PCS. WOMEN WITH HIGH BASELINE DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IN YG REPORTED MARGINALLY HIGHER 3-MONTH MCS THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN WL (P = .11). WOMEN WITH HIGH BASELINE SLEEP DISTURBANCES IN YG REPORTED HIGHER 3-MONTHS MCS THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN WL (P < .01) AND HIGHER 6-MONTH MCS THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN ST (P = .01). YG LED TO GREATER BENEFIT FINDING THAN ST AND WL ACROSS THE FOLLOW-UP (P = .01). THREE-MONTH BENEFIT FINDING PARTIALLY MEDIATED THE EFFECT OF YG ON 6-MONTH PCS. POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS SYMPTOMS AND CORTISOL SLOPE DID NOT MEDIATE TREATMENT EFFECT ON QOL. CONCLUSION YOGA MAY PROVIDE THE GREATEST MENTAL-HEALTH-RELATED QOL BENEFITS FOR THOSE EXPERIENCING PRE-RADIOTHERAPY SLEEP DISTURBANCE AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. YOGA MAY IMPROVE PHYSICAL-HEALTH-RELATED QOL BY INCREASING ABILITY TO FIND BENEFIT IN THE CANCER EXPERIENCE.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
5 2654  32 YOGA IMPROVES QUALITY OF LIFE AND BENEFIT FINDING IN WOMEN UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY FOR BREAST CANCER. THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY. SIXTY-ONE WOMEN WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER A YOGA OR A WAIT-LIST GROUP. YOGA CLASSES WERE TAUGHT BIWEEKLY DURING THE 6 WEEKS OF RADIOTHERAPY. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED MEASURES OF QOL, FATIGUE, BENEFIT FINDING (FINDING MEANING IN THE CANCER EXPERIENCE), INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS, SLEEP DISTURBANCES, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, AND ANXIETY BEFORE RADIOTHERAPY AND THEN AGAIN 1 WEEK, 1 MONTH, AND 3 MONTHS AFTER THE END OF RADIOTHERAPY. GENERAL LINEAR MODEL ANALYSES REVEALED THAT COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP, THE YOGA GROUP REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER GENERAL HEALTH PERCEPTION (P = .005) AND PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING SCORES (P = .04) 1 WEEK POSTRADIOTHERAPY; HIGHER LEVELS OF INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS 1 MONTH POSTRADIOTHERAPY (P = .01); AND GREATER BENEFIT FINDING 3 MONTHS POSTRADIOTHERAPY (P = .01). THERE WERE NO OTHER GROUP DIFFERENCES IN OTHER QOL SUBSCALES FOR FATIGUE, DEPRESSION, OR SLEEP SCORES. EXPLORATORY ANALYSES INDICATED THAT INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS 1 MONTH AFTER RADIOTHERAPY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH BENEFIT FINDING 3 MONTHS AFTER RADIOTHERAPY (R = .36, P = .011). OUR RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE YOGA PROGRAM WAS ASSOCIATED WITH STATISTICALLY AND CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN ASPECTS OF QOL.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
6 1087  36 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY COMPARES THE EFFECTS OF AN INTEGRATED YOGA PROGRAM WITH BRIEF SUPPORTIVE THERAPY ON DISTRESSFUL SYMPTOMS IN BREAST CANCER OUTPATIENTS UNDERGOING ADJUVANT RADIOTHERAPY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: EIGHTY-EIGHT STAGE II AND III BREAST CANCER OUTPATIENTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO RECEIVE YOGA (N = 44) OR BRIEF SUPPORTIVE THERAPY (N = 44) PRIOR TO THEIR RADIOTHERAPY TREATMENT. INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF YOGA SESSIONS LASTING 60 MIN DAILY WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP WAS IMPARTED SUPPORTIVE THERAPY ONCE IN 10 DAYS DURING THE COURSE OF THEIR ADJUVANT RADIOTHERAPY. ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED ROTTERDAM SYMPTOM CHECK LIST AND EUROPEAN ORGANIZATION FOR RESEARCH IN THE TREATMENT OF CANCER-QUALITY OF LIFE (EORTC QOL C30) SYMPTOM SCALE. ASSESSMENTS WERE DONE AT BASELINE AND AFTER 6 WEEKS OF RADIOTHERAPY TREATMENT. RESULTS: A GLM REPEATED-MEASURES ANOVA SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS (P = 0.01), FATIGUE (P = 0.007), INSOMNIA (P = 0.001), AND APPETITE LOSS (P = 0.002) OVER TIME IN THE YOGA GROUP AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE ACTIVITY LEVEL (P = 0.02) IN THE YOGA GROUP AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AND FATIGUE, NAUSEA AND VOMITING, PAIN, DYSPNEA, INSOMNIA, APPETITE LOSS, AND CONSTIPATION. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE ACTIVITY LEVEL AND FATIGUE, NAUSEA AND VOMITING, PAIN, DYSPNEA, INSOMNIA, AND APPETITE LOSS. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS SUGGEST BENEFICIAL EFFECTS WITH YOGA INTERVENTION IN MANAGING CANCER-AND TREATMENT-RELATED SYMPTOMS IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS.	2009

8 1868  32 RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY. PURPOSE: PREVIOUS RESEARCH INCORPORATING YOGA (YG) INTO RADIOTHERAPY (XRT) FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER FINDS IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). HOWEVER, SHORTCOMINGS IN THIS RESEARCH LIMIT THE FINDINGS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: PATIENTS WITH STAGES 0 TO III BREAST CANCER WERE RECRUITED BEFORE STARTING XRT AND WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO YG (N = 53) OR STRETCHING (ST; N = 56) THREE TIMES A WEEK FOR 6 WEEKS DURING XRT OR WAITLIST (WL; N = 54) CONTROL. SELF-REPORT MEASURES OF QOL (MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY 36-ITEM SHORT-FORM SURVEY; PRIMARY OUTCOMES), FATIGUE, DEPRESSION, AND SLEEP QUALITY, AND FIVE SALIVA SAMPLES PER DAY FOR 3 CONSECUTIVE DAYS WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE, END OF TREATMENT, AND 1, 3, AND 6 MONTHS LATER. RESULTS: THE YG GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER INCREASES IN PHYSICAL COMPONENT SCALE SCORES COMPARED WITH THE WL GROUP AT 1 AND 3 MONTHS AFTER XRT (P = .01 AND P = .01). AT 1, 3, AND 6 MONTHS, THE YG GROUP HAD GREATER INCREASES IN PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING COMPARED WITH BOTH ST AND WL GROUPS (P < .05), WITH ST AND WL DIFFERENCES AT ONLY 3 MONTHS (P < .02). THE GROUP DIFFERENCES WERE SIMILAR FOR GENERAL HEALTH REPORTS. BY THE END OF XRT, THE YG AND ST GROUPS ALSO HAD A REDUCTION IN FATIGUE (P < .05). THERE WERE NO GROUP DIFFERENCES FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND SLEEP QUALITY. CORTISOL SLOPE WAS STEEPEST FOR THE YG GROUP COMPARED WITH THE ST AND WL GROUPS AT THE END (P = .023 AND P = .008) AND 1 MONTH AFTER XRT (P = .05 AND P = .04). CONCLUSION: YG IMPROVED QOL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH XRT BEYOND THE BENEFITS OF SIMPLE ST EXERCISES, AND THESE BENEFITS APPEAR TO HAVE LONG-TERM DURABILITY.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
9 2808  36 YOGA THERAPY TO REDUCE FATIGUE IN CANCER: EFFECTS OF REMINDER E-MAILS AND LONG-TERM EFFICACY. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE EFFICACY OF REMINDER E-MAILS TO CONTINUE YOGA THERAPY ON PRACTICE FREQUENCY AND FATIGUE IN CANCER PATIENTS AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA ON FATIGUE, DEPRESSION, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. METHODOLOGY: ONE HUNDRED TWO CANCER PATIENTS WHO COMPLETED AN 8-WEEK YOGA THERAPY WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO TWO GROUPS: REMINDER (N = 51) VS. NO-REMINDER GROUP (N = 51). AFTER COMPLETING YOGA THERAPY, THE REMINDER GROUP RECEIVED WEEKLY E-MAILS FOR 24 WEEKS, WHICH REMINDED THEM OF PRACTICING YOGA, WHEREAS THE NO-REMINDER GROUP DID NOT. PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE FATIGUE AND PRACTICE FREQUENCY, AND LONG-TERM OUTCOMES WERE FATIGUE, DEPRESSION, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. DATA WERE ASSESSED USING QUESTIONNAIRES AFTER YOGA THERAPY (T1) AND 6 MONTHS AFTER COMPLETING YOGA THERAPY (T2). RESULT: A SIGNIFICANTLY STRONGER REDUCTION OF GENERAL (P = 0.038, D = 0.42) AND EMOTIONAL FATIGUE (P = 0.004, D = 0.59) AND A HIGHER INCREASE OF PRACTICE FREQUENCY (P = 0.015, D = 0.52) BETWEEN T1 AND T2 WERE FOUND FOR THE REMINDER GROUP COMPARED TO THE NO-REMINDER GROUP. IN THE MEDIATION MODEL, PRACTICE FREQUENCY AS A MEDIATOR PARTIALLY EXPLAINED THE CHANGES IN EMOTIONAL FATIGUE (INDIRECT EFFECT B = - 0.10). LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY REGARDING FATIGUE, DEPRESSION, AND QUALITY OF LIFE WERE FOUND (F > 7.46, P < 0.001, D > 0.54). CONCLUSION: WEEKLY REMINDER E-MAILS AFTER YOGA THERAPY CAN POSITIVELY AFFECT GENERAL AND EMOTIONAL FATIGUE AND HELP CANCER PATIENTS WITH FATIGUE ESTABLISH A REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE AT HOME. HOWEVER, HIGHER PRACTICE FREQUENCY DID NOT LEAD TO HIGHER PHYSICAL OR COGNITIVE FATIGUE IMPROVEMENT, SUGGESTING OTHER FACTORS THAT MEDIATE EFFICACY ON PHYSICAL OR COGNITIVE FATIGUE, SUCH AS MINDFULNESS OR SIDE EFFECTS OF THERAPY.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
10  389  39 BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN HEART FAILURE PATIENTS. BACKGROUND: THE NUMBER OF AFRICAN AMERICAN (AA) PATIENTS LIVING WITH HEART FAILURE (HF) HAS BEEN INCREASING, ESPECIALLY AMONG THE ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGED. YOGA THERAPY HAS BEEN FOUND TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS AMONG HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS, BUT ITS EFFECT IN PATIENTS WITH HF REMAINS UNKNOWN. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY ON CARDIOVASCULAR ENDURANCE (VO2PEAK), FLEXIBILITY, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), AND INFLAMMATORY MARKERS ON MEDICALLY STABLE HF PATIENTS. METHODS: FORTY PATIENTS (38 AA, 1 ASIAN, AND 1 CAUCASIAN) WITH SYSTOLIC OR DIASTOLIC HF WERE RANDOMIZED TO THE YOGA GROUP (YG, N = 21) OR THE CONTROL GROUP (CG, N = 19). ALL PATIENTS WERE ASKED TO FOLLOW A HOME WALK PROGRAM. PREMEASUREMENT AND POSTMEASUREMENT INCLUDED A TREADMILL STRESS TEST TO PEAK EXERTION, FLEXIBILITY, INTERLEUKIN-6 (IL-6), C-REACTIVE PROTEIN (CRP), AND EXTRACELLULAR SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE (EC-SOD). QOL WAS ASSESSED BY THE MINNESOTA LIVING WITH HEART FAILURE QUESTIONNAIRE (MLWHFQ). RESULTS: THE STATISTICAL ANALYSES (ASSESSED BY ANOVA AND T-TESTS) WERE SIGNIFICANT FOR FAVORABLE CHANGES IN THE YG, COMPARED WITH THOSE IN THE CG, FOR FLEXIBILITY (P = 0.012), TREADMILL TIME (P = 0.002), VO2PEAK (P = 0.003), AND THE BIOMARKERS (IL-6, P = 0.004; CRP, P = 0.016; AND EC-SOD, P = 0.012). WITHIN THE YG, PRETEST TO POSTTEST SCORES FOR THE TOTAL (P = 0.02) AND PHYSICAL SUBSCALES (P < 0.001) OF THE MLWHFQ WERE IMPROVED. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA THERAPY OFFERED ADDITIONAL BENEFITS TO THE STANDARD MEDICAL CARE OF PREDOMINANTLY AA HF PATIENTS BY IMPROVING CARDIOVASCULAR ENDURANCE, QOL, INFLAMMATORY MARKERS, AND FLEXIBILITY.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
11 2698  32 YOGA INTERVENTION AND REMINDER E-MAILS FOR REDUCING CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE - A STUDY PROTOCOL OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: ALMOST 90% OF CANCER PATIENTS SUFFER FROM SYMPTOMS OF FATIGUE DURING TREATMENT. SUPPORTING TREATMENTS ARE INCREASINGLY USED TO ALLEVIATE THE BURDEN OF FATIGUE. THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA ON FATIGUE AND THE EFFECT OF WEEKLY REMINDER E-MAILS ON EXERCISE FREQUENCY AND FATIGUE SYMPTOMS. METHODS: THE AIM OF THE FIRST PART OF THE STUDY WILL EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR CANCER PATIENTS WITH MIXED DIAGNOSES REPORTING FATIGUE. WE WILL RANDOMLY ALLOCATE 128 PATIENTS TO AN INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 64) RECEIVING YOGA AND A WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 64) RECEIVING YOGA 9 WEEKS LATER. THE YOGA THERAPY WILL BE PERFORMED IN WEEKLY SESSIONS OF 60 MIN EACH FOR 8 WEEKS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WILL BE SELF-REPORTED FATIGUE SYMPTOMS. IN THE SECOND PART OF THE STUDY, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF REMINDER E-MAILS WITH REGARD TO THE EXERCISE FREQUENCY AND SELF-REPORTED FATIGUE SYMPTOMS WILL BE EVALUATED. A RANDOMIZED ALLOCATED GROUP OF THE PARTICIPANTS ("EMAIL") RECEIVES WEEKLY REMINDER E-MAILS, THE OTHER GROUP DOES NOT. DATA WILL BE ASSESSED USING QUESTIONNAIRES THE BEGINNING AND AFTER YOGA THERAPY AS WELL AS AFTER 6 MONTHS. DISCUSSION: SUPPORT OF PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM FATIGUE IS AN IMPORTANT GOAL IN CANCER PATIENTS CARE. IF YOGA THERAPY WILL REDUCE FATIGUE, THIS TYPE OF THERAPY MAY BE INTRODUCED INTO ROUTINE PRACTICE. IF THE REMINDER E-MAILS PROVE TO BE HELPFUL, NEW OFFERS FOR PATIENTS MAY ALSO DEVELOP FROM THIS.

12  287  22 ADJUNCT YOGA THERAPY: INFLUENCE ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY IN MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER - A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. HRV IS INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO SEVERITY OF DEPRESSION. EFFECT OF 12-WEEKS ADJUNCT YOGA THERAPY ON HRV IN PATIENTS WITH MDD WAS ASSESSED THROUGH A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. SIXTY-EIGHT SUBJECTS (40 FEMALES) WITH MEAN AGE 31.58 +/- 8.79 YEARS, SCORING >/= 18 ON HDRS WERE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER (YG; N = 35) OR (WG; N = 33). LINEAR MIXED MODEL ANALYSIS SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS. ON COMPARING CHANGE IN MEAN PERCENTAGE, SUBSTANTIAL MORE DECREASE COULD BE ELICITED ONLY FOR LF/HF RATIO IN YG COMPARED TO WG, WHILE BEING COMPARABLE FOR OTHER VARIABLES ACROSS THE GROUPS. FINDINGS SUGGEST YOGA THERAPY MAY HELP IN BRINGING PARASYMPATHETIC DOMINANCE IN PATIENTS WITH MDD.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
13 1862  40 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA AMONG A MULTIETHNIC SAMPLE OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS: EFFECTS ON QUALITY OF LIFE. PURPOSE: THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE IMPACT OF YOGA, INCLUDING PHYSICAL POSES, BREATHING, AND MEDITATION EXERCISES, ON QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), FATIGUE, DISTRESSED MOOD, AND SPIRITUAL WELL-BEING AMONG A MULTIETHNIC SAMPLE OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-EIGHT PATIENTS (42% AFRICAN AMERICAN, 31% HISPANIC) RECRUITED FROM AN URBAN CANCER CENTER WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED (2:1 RATIO) TO A 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION (N = 84) OR A 12-WEEK WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 44). CHANGES IN QOL (EG, FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CANCER THERAPY) FROM BEFORE RANDOM ASSIGNMENT (T1) TO THE 3-MONTH FOLLOW-UP (T3) WERE EXAMINED; PREDICTORS OF ADHERENCE WERE ALSO ASSESSED. NEARLY HALF OF ALL PATIENTS WERE RECEIVING MEDICAL TREATMENT. RESULTS: REGRESSION ANALYSES INDICATED THAT THE CONTROL GROUP HAD A GREATER DECREASE IN SOCIAL WELL-BEING COMPARED WITH THE INTERVENTION GROUP AFTER CONTROLLING FOR BASELINE SOCIAL WELL-BEING AND COVARIATES (P < .0001). SECONDARY ANALYSES OF 71 PATIENTS NOT RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY DURING THE INTERVENTION PERIOD INDICATED FAVORABLE OUTCOMES FOR THE INTERVENTION GROUP COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP IN OVERALL QOL (P < .008), EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING (P < .015), SOCIAL WELL-BEING (P < .004), SPIRITUAL WELL-BEING (P < .009), AND DISTRESSED MOOD (P < .031). SIXTY-NINE PERCENT OF INTERVENTION PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED CLASSES (MEAN NUMBER OF CLASSES ATTENDED BY ACTIVE CLASS PARTICIPANTS = 7.00 +/- 3.80), WITH LOWER ADHERENCE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED FATIGUE (P < .001), RADIOTHERAPY (P < .0001), YOUNGER AGE (P < .008), AND NO ANTIESTROGEN THERAPY (P < .02). CONCLUSION: DESPITE LIMITED ADHERENCE, THIS INTENT-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT YOGA IS ASSOCIATED WITH BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON SOCIAL FUNCTIONING AMONG A MEDICALLY DIVERSE SAMPLE OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. AMONG PATIENTS NOT RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY, YOGA APPEARS TO ENHANCE EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING AND MOOD AND MAY SERVE TO BUFFER DETERIORATION IN BOTH OVERALL AND SPECIFIC DOMAINS OF QOL.	2007	
                                                                                                       
14 1075  39 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PHASE ANGLE AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER: A RANDOMIZED, SINGLE-BLIND, CONTROLLED TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: PHASE ANGLE (PA), A PARAMETER THAT IS OBTAINED FROM BODY COMPOSITION ANALYSIS, IS AN INDICATOR OF CELLULAR HEALTH STATUS. A LOWER PA IN CANCER PATIENTS CAN LEAD TO A DECREASE IN FUNCTIONAL STATUS AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AND INCREASED MORTALITY. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT PHYSICAL ACTIVITY INCREASES PA. IN THIS STUDY, WE AIMED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA ON PA, BODY COMPOSITION, AND QOL IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. METHODS: THIRTY-ONE PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO THE YOGA (GROUP 1, N = 15) AND THE CONTROL GROUP (GROUP 2, N = 16). HATHA YOGA WAS PRACTICED TWICE A WEEK FOR 10 WEEKS IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP. THE PA OF THE PATIENTS WAS ASSESSED USING A BODY ANALYSIS INSTRUMENT, AND QOL WAS EVALUATED WITH AN EORTC QLQ QUESTIONNAIRE BOTH BEFORE TREATMENT AND AT WEEK 10. RESULTS: GROUP 1 HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE POSTTREATMENT EORTC QLQ FUNCTIONAL AND GLOBAL SCORES (P < 0.05). IN GROUP 2, A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT WAS OBSERVED IN THE EORTC QLQ SYMPTOM SUBSCALE (P = 0.035). PA VALUES DID NOT SHOW ANY IMPROVEMENTS IN BOTH GROUPS (P > 0.05). COMPARISON OF THE 2 GROUPS REVEALED NO DIFFERENCES. CONCLUSION: YOGA MAY HAVE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON QOL IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER BUT DOES NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON PA. THERE IS A NEED FOR FURTHER STUDIES TO MAKE A DEFINITIVE STATEMENT.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
15  962  28 EFFECTS OF A YOGA PROGRAM ON CORTISOL RHYTHM AND MOOD STATES IN EARLY BREAST CANCER PATIENTS UNDERGOING ADJUVANT RADIOTHERAPY: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. UNLABELLED: OBJECTIVES. THIS STUDY COMPARES THE EFFECTS OF AN INTEGRATED YOGA PROGRAM WITH BRIEF SUPPORTIVE THERAPY IN BREAST CANCER OUTPATIENTS UNDERGOING ADJUVANT RADIOTHERAPY AT A CANCER CENTER. METHODS: EIGHTY-EIGHT STAGE II AND III BREAST CANCER OUTPATIENTS ARE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO RECEIVE YOGA (N = 44) OR BRIEF SUPPORTIVE THERAPY (N = 44) PRIOR TO RADIOTHERAPY TREATMENT. ASSESSMENTS INCLUDE DIURNAL SALIVARY CORTISOL LEVELS 3 DAYS BEFORE AND AFTER RADIOTHERAPY AND SELF-RATINGS OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND STRESS COLLECTED BEFORE AND AFTER 6 WEEKS OF RADIOTHERAPY. RESULTS: ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE REVEALS SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN ANXIETY (P < .001), DEPRESSION (P = .002), PERCEIVED STRESS (P < .001), 6 A.M. SALIVARY CORTISOL (P = .009), AND POOLED MEAN CORTISOL (P = .03) IN THE YOGA GROUP COMPARED WITH CONTROLS. THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN MORNING SALIVARY CORTISOL LEVEL AND ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. CONCLUSION: YOGA MIGHT HAVE A ROLE IN MANAGING SELF-REPORTED PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AND MODULATING CIRCADIAN PATTERNS OF STRESS HORMONES IN EARLY BREAST CANCER PATIENTS UNDERGOING ADJUVANT RADIOTHERAPY.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
16 1980  33 SLEEP MODERATES THE EFFECTS OF TIBETAN YOGA FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY. THIS STUDY EXAMINED SELF-REPORTED AND ACTIGRAPHY-ASSESSED SLEEP AND DEPRESSION AS MODERATORS OF THE EFFECT OF A TIBETAN YOGA INTERVENTION ON SLEEP AND DEPRESSION AMONG WOMEN UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY FOR BREAST CANCER. THIS IS A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF AN RCT EXAMINING A 4-SESSION TIBETAN YOGA PROGRAM (TYP; N = 74) VERSUS STRETCHING PROGRAM (STP; N = 68) OR USUAL CARE (UC; N = 85) ON SELF-REPORTED SLEEP (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI), ACTIGRAPHY-ASSESSED SLEEP EFFICIENCY (SE)) AND DEPRESSION (CENTERS FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES DEPRESSION SCALE; CES-D) FOR WOMEN UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY FOR BREAST CANCER. DATA WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE AND 1-WEEK AND 3-MONTH POST-INTERVENTION. BASELINE PSQI, ACTIGRAPHY-SE, AND CES-D WERE EXAMINED AS MODERATORS OF THE EFFECT OF GROUP ON PSQI, ACTIGRAPHY-SE, AND CES-D 1 WEEK AND 3 MONTHS AFTER TREATMENT. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT BASELINE ACTIGRAPHY-SE X GROUP EFFECT ON PSQI AT 1 WEEK (P < .001) AND 3 MONTHS (P = .002) AND ON CES-D AT 3 MONTHS (P = .049). SPECIFICALLY, THE NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION OF BASELINE ACTIGRAPHY-SE WITH SUBSEQUENT PSQI AND CES-D WAS BUFFERED FOR WOMEN IN THE TYP AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT IN STP, COMPARED TO THOSE IN THE UC. BASELINE PSQI AND CES-D WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT MODERATORS OF THE EFFECT OF GROUP ON ANY OUTCOME. BEHAVIORALLY ASSESSED SLEEP MAY BE A MORE ROBUST INDICATOR OF WHICH PATIENTS ARE MOST APPROPRIATE FOR A YOGA INTERVENTION THAN SELF-REPORTED SLEEP QUALITY. WOMEN WITH POOR SLEEP EFFICIENCY MAY DERIVE THE GREATEST BENEFIT IN TERMS OF SLEEP QUALITY AND MOOD FROM A YOGA INTERVENTION.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
17 1097  40 EFFECTS OF YOGA PROGRAM ON QUALITY OF LIFE AND AFFECT IN EARLY BREAST CANCER PATIENTS UNDERGOING ADJUVANT RADIOTHERAPY: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: THIS STUDY COMPARES THE EFFECTS OF AN INTEGRATED YOGA PROGRAM WITH BRIEF SUPPORTIVE THERAPY IN BREAST CANCER OUTPATIENTS UNDERGOING ADJUVANT RADIOTHERAPY AT A CANCER CENTRE. METHODS: EIGHTY-EIGHT STAGE II AND III BREAST CANCER OUTPATIENTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO RECEIVE YOGA (N = 44) OR BRIEF SUPPORTIVE THERAPY (N = 44) PRIOR TO THEIR RADIOTHERAPY TREATMENT. INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF YOGA SESSIONS LASTING 60 MIN DAILY WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP WAS IMPARTED SUPPORTIVE THERAPY ONCE IN 10 DAYS. ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED EUROPEAN ORGANIZATION FOR RESEARCH IN THE TREATMENT OF CANCER-QUALITY OF LIFE (EORTCQOL C30) FUNCTIONAL SCALES AND POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECT SCHEDULE (PANAS). ASSESSMENTS WERE DONE AT BASELINE AND AFTER 6 WEEKS OF RADIOTHERAPY TREATMENT. RESULTS: AN INTENTION TO TREAT GLM REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE ACROSS GROUPS OVER TIME FOR POSITIVE AFFECT, NEGATIVE AFFECT AND EMOTIONAL FUNCTION AND SOCIAL FUNCTION. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN POSITIVE AFFECT (ES = 0.59, P = 0.007, 95%CI 1.25 TO 7.8), EMOTIONAL FUNCTION (ES = 0.71, P = 0.001, 95%CI 6.45 TO 25.33) AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION (ES = 0.48, P = 0.03, 95%CI 1.2 TO 18.5), AND DECREASE IN NEGATIVE AFFECT (ES = 0.84, P<0.001, 95%CI -13.4 TO -4.4) IN THE YOGA GROUP AS COMPARED TO CONTROLS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN POSITIVE AFFECT WITH ROLE FUNCTION, SOCIAL FUNCTION AND GLOBAL QUALITY OF LIFE. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN NEGATIVE AFFECT WITH PHYSICAL FUNCTION, ROLE FUNCTION, EMOTIONAL FUNCTION AND SOCIAL FUNCTION. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS SUGGEST A POSSIBLE ROLE FOR YOGA TO IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE AND AFFECT IN BREAST CANCER OUTPATIENTS.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
18  167  45 A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED BICENTER TRIAL OF YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH COLORECTAL CANCER. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS TRIAL WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH COLORECTAL CANCER. METHODS: PATIENTS WITH NON-METASTATIC COLORECTAL CANCER WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A 10-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION (90 MIN ONCE WEEKLY) OR A WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS DISEASE-SPECIFIC QUALITY OF LIFE (FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT OF CANCER THERAPY - COLORECTAL [FACT-C]) AT WEEK 10. SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED FACT-C SUBSCALES: SPIRITUAL WELL-BEING (FACT - SPIRITUALITY); FATIGUE (FACT - FATIGUE); SLEEP DISTURBANCES (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INVENTORY); DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY (HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE); BODY AWARENESS (SCALE OF BODY CONNECTION); AND BODY-EFFICACY EXPECTATIONS (BODY-EFFICACY EXPECTATIONS SCALE). OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED AT WEEK 10 AND WEEK 22 AFTER RANDOMIZATION. RESULTS: FIFTY-FOUR PATIENTS (MEAN AGE 68.3 +/- 9.7 YEARS) WERE RANDOMIZED TO YOGA (N = 27; ATTRITION RATE 22.2%) AND CONTROL GROUP (N = 27; ATTRITION RATE 18.5%). PATIENTS IN THE YOGA GROUP ATTENDED A MEAN OF 5.3 +/- 4.0 YOGA CLASSES. NO SIGNIFICANT GROUP DIFFERENCES FOR THE FACT-C TOTAL SCORE WERE FOUND. GROUP DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND FOR EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING AT WEEK 22 ( = 1.59; 95% CI = 0.27,2.90; P = 0.019), SLEEP DISTURBANCES AT WEEK 22 ( = -1.08; 95% CI = -2.13, -0.03; P = 0.043), ANXIETY AT WEEK 10 ( = -1.14; 95% CI = -2.20, -0.09; P = 0.043), AND DEPRESSION AT WEEK 10 ( = -1.34; 95% CI = -2.61, -0.8; P = 0.038). NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS OCCURRED IN THE YOGA GROUP, WHILE LIVER METASTASES WERE DIAGNOSED IN ONE PATIENT IN THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: THIS RANDOMIZED TRIAL FOUND NO EFFECTS OF YOGA ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH COLORECTAL CANCER. GIVEN THE HIGH ATTRITION RATE AND LOW INTERVENTION ADHERENCE, NO DEFINITE CONCLUSIONS CAN BE DRAWN FROM THIS TRIAL.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
19 2836  39 YOGA'S IMPACT ON INFLAMMATION, MOOD, AND FATIGUE IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. PURPOSE: TO EVALUATE YOGA'S IMPACT ON INFLAMMATION, MOOD, AND FATIGUE. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED 3-MONTH TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED WITH TWO POST-TREATMENT ASSESSMENTS OF 200 BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS ASSIGNED TO EITHER 12 WEEKS OF 90-MINUTE TWICE PER WEEK HATHA YOGA CLASSES OR A WAIT-LIST CONTROL. THE MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES WERE LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE-STIMULATED PRODUCTION OF PROINFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES INTERLEUKIN-6 (IL-6), TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR ALPHA (TNF-ALPHA), AND INTERLEUKIN-1BETA (IL-1BETA), AND SCORES ON THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL FATIGUE SYMPTOM INVENTORY-SHORT FORM (MFSI-SF), THE VITALITY SCALE FROM THE MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY 36-ITEM SHORT FORM (SF-36), AND THE CENTER FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES-DEPRESSION (CES-D) SCALE. RESULTS: IMMEDIATELY POST-TREATMENT, FATIGUE WAS NOT LOWER (P > .05) BUT VITALITY WAS HIGHER (P = .01) IN THE YOGA GROUP COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. AT 3 MONTHS POST-TREATMENT, FATIGUE WAS LOWER IN THE YOGA GROUP (P = .002), VITALITY WAS HIGHER (P = .01), AND IL-6 (P = .027), TNF-ALPHA (P = .027), AND IL-1BETA (P = .037) WERE LOWER FOR YOGA PARTICIPANTS COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. GROUPS DID NOT DIFFER ON DEPRESSION AT EITHER TIME (P > .2). PLANNED SECONDARY ANALYSES SHOWED THAT THE FREQUENCY OF YOGA PRACTICE HAD STRONGER ASSOCIATIONS WITH FATIGUE AT BOTH POST-TREATMENT VISITS (P = .019; P < .001), AS WELL AS VITALITY (P = .016; P = .0045), BUT NOT DEPRESSION (P > .05) THAN SIMPLE GROUP ASSIGNMENT; MORE FREQUENT PRACTICE PRODUCED LARGER CHANGES. AT 3 MONTHS POST-TREATMENT, INCREASING YOGA PRACTICE ALSO LED TO A DECREASE IN IL-6 (P = .01) AND IL-1BETA (P = .03) PRODUCTION BUT NOT IN TNF-ALPHA PRODUCTION (P > .05). CONCLUSION: CHRONIC INFLAMMATION MAY FUEL DECLINES IN PHYSICAL FUNCTION LEADING TO FRAILTY AND DISABILITY. IF YOGA DAMPENS OR LIMITS BOTH FATIGUE AND INFLAMMATION, THEN REGULAR PRACTICE COULD HAVE SUBSTANTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                     
20  975  39 EFFECTS OF AN INTEGRATED YOGA PROGRAMME ON CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA AND EMESIS IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE EFFECT OF AN INTEGRATED YOGA PROGRAMME ON CHEMOTHERAPY-RELATED NAUSEA AND EMESIS IN EARLY OPERABLE BREAST CANCER OUTPATIENTS. SIXTY-TWO SUBJECTS WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO RECEIVE YOGA (N = 28) OR SUPPORTIVE THERAPY INTERVENTION (N = 34) DURING THE COURSE OF THEIR CHEMOTHERAPY. BOTH GROUPS HAD SIMILAR SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC AND MEDICAL CHARACTERISTICS. INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF BOTH SUPERVISED AND HOME PRACTICE OF YOGA SESSIONS LASTING FOR 60 MIN DAILY, WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED SUPPORTIVE THERAPY AND COPING PREPARATION DURING THEIR HOSPITAL VISITS OVER A COMPLETE COURSE OF CHEMOTHERAPY. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS THE MORROW ASSESSMENT OF NAUSEA AND EMESIS (MANE) ASSESSED AFTER THE FOURTH CYCLE OF CHEMOTHERAPY. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED MEASURES FOR ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, QUALITY OF LIFE, DISTRESSFUL SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT-RELATED TOXICITY ASSESSED BEFORE AND DURING THE COURSE OF CHEMOTHERAPY. FOLLOWING YOGA, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN POST-CHEMOTHERAPY-INDUCED NAUSEA FREQUENCY (P = 0.01) AND NAUSEA INTENSITY (P = 0.01), AND INTENSITY OF ANTICIPATORY NAUSEA (P = 0.01) AND ANTICIPATORY VOMITING (P = 0.05) AS COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN MANE SCORES AND ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND DISTRESSFUL SYMPTOMS. IN CONCLUSION, THE RESULTS SUGGEST A POSSIBLE USE FOR STRESS REDUCTION INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS YOGA IN COMPLEMENTING CONVENTIONAL ANTIEMETICS TO MANAGE CHEMOTHERAPY-RELATED NAUSEA AND EMESIS.	2007

1 2784 94 YOGA THERAPY AS AN ADJUNCT TO TRADITIONAL TOOTH BRUSHING TRAINING METHODS IN CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER. AIM: TO EVALUATE IF YOGA COULD BE AN ADJUNCT TO REGULAR TRAINING METHODS IN TRAINING BRUSHING SKILL TO CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (ASD). METHODS: SEVENTY-TWO CHILDREN WITH ASD AGED 7-15 YEARS WERE SELECTED AND DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS (N = 36). CHILDREN IN GROUP I RECEIVED VISUAL PEDAGOGY AND VIDEO MODELING AND CHILDREN IN GROUP II RECEIVED VISUAL PEDAGOGY AND VIDEO MODELING WITH YOGA. PLAQUE AND GINGIVAL INDICES (PI AND GI) WERE RECORDED AT BASELINE AND AT THE END OF FIRST, SECOND, THIRD, AND SIXTH MONTH. THE SCORES WERE SUMMARIZED AS MEAN AND STANDARD DEVIATION AND INTER-GROUP COMPARISON WAS DONE USING INDEPENDENT T-TEST. RESULTS: INTER-GROUP COMPARISON OF MEAN PLAQUE AND GINGIVAL INDICES SCORES WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AT SECOND MONTH (P = .039 FOR PI AND P = .009 FOR GI). THE SCORES WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EVEN AT THIRD MONTH (P = .001 FOR PI AND P = .002 FOR GI) AND SIXTH MONTH (P = .001 PI AND GI), WITH CHILDREN IN GROUP II DEMONSTRATING BETTER ORAL HYGIENE. CONCLUSION: YOGA TRAINING CAN BE USED AS AN ADJUNCT TO ENHANCE TOOTH BRUSHING LEARNING CAPABILITIES OF CHILDREN WITH ASD IN ADDITION TO VISUAL MODELING AND PEDAGOGY.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
2 2806 22 YOGA THERAPY KNOWLEDGE IN THIRD-YEAR PHARMACY STUDENTS: AN EDUCATION INTERVENTION. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: THE OMISSION OF YOGA EDUCATION IN HEALTH PROFESSIONS CURRICULA LIMITS HEALTH PROFESSIONALS FROM UNDERSTANDING HOW TO SUPPORT PATIENT WELL-BEING IN AN INTEGRATED MANNER. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A YOGA THERAPY-BASED EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION IN INCREASING YOGA KNOWLEDGE OF THIRD-YEAR PHARMACY STUDENTS. EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITY AND SETTING: STUDENTS IN THE PHARMACOGNOSY AND COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE COURSE RECEIVED A THREE-HOUR EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION OVER TWO CLASS MEETINGS ON YOGA THERAPY DURING FALL 2019. THE PEDAGOGICAL METHOD OF PEER INSTRUCTION WAS USED, AND PRE- AND POST-QUESTIONNAIRES WERE ADMINISTERED ONLINE PRIOR TO AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION. THE INSTRUMENT CONTAINED EIGHT DEMOGRAPHIC, SIX YOGA KNOWLEDGE AND PARTICIPATION, 10 YOGA THERAPY, AND 15 REFERRAL BEHAVIOR QUESTIONS. FINDINGS: A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN YOGA KNOWLEDGE SCORES FROM 1.43 +/- 0.9 BEFORE THE EDUCATION INTERVENTION TO 5.69 +/- 1.65 AFTER THE INTERVENTION OCCURRED (P < .01) WAS FOUND. A MAJORITY BELIEVED THAT YOGA THERAPY SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE CURRICULUM. SUMMARY: INCREASES IN POST-QUESTIONNAIRE KNOWLEDGE SCORES SUGGESTED THAT THE EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION INCREASED PHARMACY STUDENTS' KNOWLEDGE OF YOGA THERAPY IN OUR SAMPLE. STUDIES SPECIFIC TO YOGA EDUCATION IN HEALTH PROFESSIONAL STUDENTS, ESPECIALLY IN THE UNITED STATES, ARE SCARCE. ADDITIONALLY, THE IMPACT OF AN EDUCATIONAL INTERVENTION ON YOGA KNOWLEDGE IN PHARMACY STUDENTS HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED. INCLUDING YOGA THERAPY IN PHARMACY CURRICULA SHOULD BE EXPLORED AS GREATER INTEGRATION OF YOGA IN HEALTHCARE IS LIKELY TO OCCUR DUE TO ITS EFFECTIVENESS AS AN ADJUNCT AND WIDESPREAD USE.	2021

4  934 26 EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM ON THE SEVERITY OF AUTISM. THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM (YTP) ON THE SEVERITY OF AUTISM IN CHILDREN WITH HIGH FUNCTION AUTISM (HFA). TWENTY-NINE CHILDREN AGED 7 TO 15 (MEAN = 11.22, SD = 2.91) YEARS WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO EITHER YOGA OR CONTROL GROUP. THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP RECEIVED AN 8-WEEK (24-SESSION) YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM (YTP). PARENTS OR CAREGIVERS OF PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED AUTISM TREATMENT EVALUATION CHECKLIST (ATEC) AT BASELINE AND THE END OF THE INTERVENTION. THE RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS WITH REGARDS TO ALL ATEC SUB-SCORES EXCEPT ATEC I (SPEECH/LANGUAGE/COMMUNICATION). THIS STUDY PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM AND IDENTIFIES SPECIFIC PROCEDURAL ENHANCEMENTS TO REDUCE THE SEVERITY OF SYMPTOMS IN CHILDREN WITH AUTISM.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
5 2797 29 YOGA THERAPY FOR PROMOTING EMOTIONAL SENSITIVITY IN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. BACKGROUND: STUDENTS NEED EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE (EI) FOR THEIR BETTER ACADEMIC EXCELLENCE. THERE ARE THREE IMPORTANT PSYCHOLOGICAL DIMENSIONS OF EI: EMOTIONAL SENSITIVITY (ES), EMOTIONAL MATURITY (EM) AND EMOTIONAL COMPETENCY (EC), WHICH MOTIVATE STUDENTS TO RECOGNIZE TRUTHFULLY, INTERPRET HONESTLY AND HANDLE TACTFULLY THE DYNAMICS OF THEIR BEHAVIORAL PATTERN. OBJECTIVE: THE STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO ASSESS ES IN THE STUDENTS UNDERGOING YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM IN THE FORM OF YOGA INSTRUCTOR'S COURSE (YIC) MODULE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY FOUR YIC STUDENTS WITH 25.77 +/- 4.85 YEARS OF MEAN AGE PARTICIPATED IN THIS STUDY OF 21 DAYS DURATION (A SINGLE GROUP PRE-POST DESIGN). THE ES DATA WAS COLLECTED BEFORE (PRE) AND AFTER (POST) YIC MODULE USING EMOTIONAL QUOTIENT TEST DEVELOPED BY DR DALIP SINGH AND DR N K CHADHA. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: MEANS, STANDARD DEVIATIONS, KOLMOGOROV-SMIRNOV TEST, AND WILCOXON SIGNED RANK TEST WERE USED FOR ANALYZING THE DATA WITH THE HELP OF SPSS 16. RESULTS: THE DATA ANALYSIS SHOWED 3.63% SIGNIFICANT INCREASE (P < 0.01) IN ES. CONCLUSION: THE PRESENT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT YIC MODULE CAN RESULT IN IMPROVEMENT OF ES AMONG UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, THUS PAVING THE WAY FOR THEIR ACADEMIC SUCCESS. ADDITIONAL WELL-DESIGNED STUDIES ARE NEEDED BEFORE A STRONG RECOMMENDATION CAN BE MADE.	2014

7  797 29 EFFECT OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON SHORT-TERM HEART RATE VARIABILITY IN CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER. BACKGROUND: AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (ASD) IS A NEURODEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER CHARACTERIZED BY IMPAIRMENT IN SOCIAL INTERACTIONS, COMMUNICATION, RESTRICTED, AND REPETITIVE BEHAVIORS. EVIDENCE-BASED TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR ASD ARE LIMITED. YOGA IS PRACTICED BY OVER 20 MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE, AND MULTIPLE STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED YOGA AS A POSSIBLE EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR CHILDREN WITH ASD. AIM: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON SHORT-TERM HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) IN CHILDREN WITH ASD. METHODOLOGY: IN THIS STUDY, 50 CHILDREN (38 BOYS AND 12 GIRLS) WITH ASD WERE RECRUITED FROM SWABHIMAAN TRUST, PALAVAKKAM, CHENNAI. THEY WERE RANDOMLY GROUPED INTO ASD WITH YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 25) AND ASD WITHOUT YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 25) BY SIMPLE LOTTERY METHOD. YOGA GROUP CHILDREN UNDERWENT YOGA TRAINING FOR 3 MONTHS, AND THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT RECEIVE ANY SUCH TRAINING. FOR SHORT-TERM HRV, 15 MIN ELECTROCARDIOGRAM RECORDING IN SITTING POSTURE WAS RECORDED IN LEAD II USING A SIMPLE ANALOG AMPLIFIER. RESULTS: IN HRV, TIME DOMAIN PARAMETERS SUCH AS MEAN RR INTERVAL (0.72 [0.74] TO 0.94 [0.92]), STANDARD DEVIATION OF THE NN INTERVALS (52.04 [54.23] TO 74.48 [72.80]), AND ROOT OF THE MEAN SQUARED DIFFERENCES OF SUCCESSIVE NN INTERVAL (32.60 [34.40] TO 40.83 [42.90]) SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN ASD CHILDREN AFTER YOGA INTERVENTION. IN FREQUENCY-DOMAIN PARAMETERS, HIGH FREQUENCY (HF) IN N. U (48.08 [47.24] TO 58.37 [59.22]) SHOWS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE AND LOW FREQUENCY (LF) IN N. U (52.4 [51.82] TO 40.51 [40.12]), AND LF/HF RATIO (1.29 [1.31] TO 0.78 [0.79]) SHOWS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN ASD WITH YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP CHILDREN AFTER 3 MONTHS OF YOGA TRAINING. CONCLUSION: YOGA INTERVENTIONS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN BRINGING PARASYMPATHETIC DOMINANCE IN ASD CHILDREN, AND THE GREATER ADVANTAGE IS BEING A NONINVASIVE WAY OF INTERVENTION TO SUPPORT CHILDREN WITH ASD AND HELP THEM TO ACHIEVE PHYSIOLOGICAL AS WELL AS PSYCHOLOGICAL BALANCE.	2019	

8  899 26 EFFECT OF YOGASANAS VERSUS GAZE STABILITY AND HABITUATION EXERCISES ON DIZZINESS IN VESTIBULAR DYSFUNCTION. BACKGROUND: DIZZINESS IS A TYPICAL MANIFESTATION OF VESTIBULAR PATHOLOGIES. CLINICAL STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT IT AFFECTS 1.82% OF YOUNG ADULTS TO MORE THAN 30% OLDER ADULTS. HABITUATION AND COMPENSATION ARE SOME TRADITIONAL REHABILITATION PROTOCOLS. OBJECTIVE: YOGA IS ALSO KNOWN TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON VESTIBULOPATHY. HENCE, A NEED ARISES TO COMPARE THE ABOVE TWO MANEUVERS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED (N = 32) AFTER SCREENING USING THE DIX-HALLPIKE AND HEAD IMPULSE TEST. THEY WERE THEN DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS (N = 16). THE FIRST ONE, GROUP A, RECEIVED YOGASANAS, AND THE SECOND ONE, GROUP B, RECEIVED GAZE STABILIZATION AND HABITUATION EXERCISES FOR 4 DAYS A WEEK FOR 3 WEEKS. PRE- AND POST INTERVENTION OUTCOME MEASURES WERE TAKEN USING THE MOTION SENSITIVITY QUOTIENT (MSQ) SCORE AND DIZZINESS HANDICAP INVENTORY (DHI) SCALE. RESULTS: IN REDUCING SYMPTOMS OF DIZZINESS, THE BETWEEN-GROUP COMPARISON SHOWS THAT GROUP A HAS SHOWN GREATER IMPROVEMENT (12.37% +/-1.43%) IN MSQ AND GROUP B HAS SHOWN GREATER IMPROVEMENT (16.12 +/- 3.56) IN DHI. WITHIN-GROUP COMPARISON SHOWS THAT BOTH THE INTERVENTIONS ARE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING SYMPTOMS OF DIZZINESS (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: BOTH GAZE STABILIZATION ALONG WITH HABITUATION EXERCISES AND YOGASANAS ARE EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING THE SYMPTOMS OF DIZZINESS IN PATIENTS WITH PERIPHERAL VESTIBULAR DYSFUNCTION. WHEN COMPARED BETWEEN THE GROUPS, YOGASANAS HAD A SUPERIOR HAND IN THE MSQ SCORE, WHEREAS GAZE STABILIZATION AND HABITUATION EXERCISES HAD A SUPERIOR HAND IN THE DHI SCALE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
9 1009 29 EFFECTS OF MULTIMODAL MANDALA YOGA ON SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL SKILLS FOR YOUTH WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER: AN EXPLORATORY STUDY. CONTEXT: YOUTH WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (ASD) DEMONSTRATES IMPAIRMENT IN THE ABILITY TO SOCIALLY AND EMOTIONALLY RELATE TO OTHERS THAT CAN LIMIT PARTICIPATION IN GROUPS, INTERACTION WITH PEERS, AND BUILDING SUCCESSFUL LIFE RELATIONSHIPS. AIMS: THE AIM OF THIS EXPLORATORY STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF A NOVEL MULTIMODAL MANDALA YOGA PROGRAM ON SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL SKILLS FOR YOUTH WITH ASD. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: FIVE MALES WITH ASD ATTENDED 1 H YOGA SESSIONS, TWICE A WEEK FOR 4 WEEKS. MULTIMODAL MANDALA YOGA COMPRISED 26 CIRCULAR PARTNER/GROUP POSES, COLOR AND TRACING SHEETS, RHYTHMIC CHANTING, YOGA CARDS, AND GAMES. TREATMENT AND RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR ASD SOCIAL SKILLS ASSESSMENT (TSSA) SCORES WERE COLLECTED BEFORE AND AFTER THE EIGHT YOGA SESSIONS. THE MODIFIED FACIAL MOOD SCALE (MFMS) WAS USED TO OBSERVE MOOD CHANGES BEFORE AND AFTER EACH YOGA CLASS. PAIRED SAMPLE T-TESTS WERE CONDUCTED ON TSSA AND MFMS SCORES TO COMPARE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL DIFFERENCES POST THE 4-WEEK CAMP. NARRATIVE FIELD NOTES WERE DOCUMENTED AFTER EACH OF THE EIGHT YOGA SESSIONS. RESULTS: A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT FROM PRE- TO POST-TEST WAS FOUND IN OVERALL TSSA (T(4) = -5.744, P = 0.005) AND ON RESPONDENT TO INITIATION (T(4) = -3.726, P = 0.020), INITIATING INTERACTION (T(4) = -8.5, P = 0.039), AND AFFECTIVE UNDERSTANDING AND PERSPECTIVE TAKING SUBSCALES (T(4) = -5.171 P = 0.007). YOUTH'S MFMS SCORES INCREASED FROM 80% TO 100% AT THE END OF EIGHT YOGA SESSIONS DEMONSTRATING A PLEASANT OR POSITIVE MOOD. THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF THE NARRATIVE NOTES IDENTIFIED THREE KEY FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE YOGA EXPERIENCE: (A) ENHANCED MOOD AND EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION, (B) INCREASED EMPATHY TOWARD OTHERS, AND (C) IMPROVED TEAMWORK SKILLS. CONCLUSION: THIS MULTIMODAL MANDALA YOGA TRAINING HAS IMPLICATION FOR DEVELOPING POSITIVE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL SKILLS FOR YOUTH WITH ASD.	2018	
                                                                                                                     
10  185 32 A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY ON CARDIAC FUNCTION AND N TERMINAL PRO BNP IN HEART FAILURE. AIMS: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE WHETHER YOGA TRAINING IN ADDITION TO STANDARD MEDICAL THERAPY CAN IMPROVE CARDIAC FUNCTION AND REDUCE N TERMINAL PRO B-TYPE NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE (NT PRO BNP) IN HEART FAILURE (HF). METHODS: 130 PATIENTS WERE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS: CONTROL GROUP (CG) (N = 65), YOGA GROUP (YG). IN YG, 44 PATIENTS AND IN CG, 48 PATIENTS COMPLETED THE STUDY. CARDIAC FUNCTION USING LEFT VENTRICULAR EJECTION FRACTION (LVEF), MYOCARDIAL PERFORMANCE INDEX (TEI INDEX), AND NT PRO BNP, A BIOMARKER OF HF, WAS ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND AFTER 12 WEEKS. RESULT: IMPROVEMENT IN LVEF, TEI INDEX, AND NT PRO BNP WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IN BOTH THE GROUPS. FURTHERMORE, WHEN THE CHANGES IN BEFORE AND AFTER 12 WEEKS WERE IN PERCENTAGE, LVEF INCREASED 36.88% IN THE YG AND 16.9% IN THE CG, TEI INDEX WAS REDUCED 27.87% IN THE YG AND 2.79% IN THE CG, NT PRO BNP WAS REDUCED 63.75% IN THE YG AND 10.77% IN THE CG. THE BETWEEN GROUP COMPARISONS FROM PRE TO POST 12 WEEKS WERE SIGNIFICANT FOR YG IMPROVEMENTS (LVEF, P < 0.01, TEI INDEX, P < 0.01, NT PRO BNP, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE ADDITION OF YOGA THERAPY TO STANDARD MEDICAL THERAPY FOR HF PATIENTS HAS A MARKEDLY BETTER EFFECT ON CARDIAC FUNCTION AND REDUCED MYOCARDIAL STRESS MEASURED USING NT PRO BNP IN PATIENTS WITH STABLE HF.	2014

13 2092 17 THE EFFECT OF THE YOGA COURSE ON MINDFULNESS AND SELF-COMPASSION AMONG NURSING STUDENTS. PURPOSE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON MINDFULNESS AND SELF-COMPASSION AMONG NURSING STUDENTS. DESIGN AND METHODS: THE QUASIEXPERIMENTAL SINGLE-GROUP PRETEST-POSTTEST DESIGN STUDY CONDUCTED WITH 47 NURSING STUDENTS. THE DATA WERE COLLECTED USING A "PERSONAL DATA FORM," THE "MINDFUL ATTENTION AWARENESS SCALE (MAAS)," AND THE "SELF-COMPASSION SCALE (SCS)." FINDINGS: WHILE THE MEAN SCORE OF THE STUDENTS FROM THE "MAAS" WAS 60.51 (+/-11.35) IN THE PRETEST, IT INCREASED TO 63.7 (+/-8.75) IN THE POSTTEST (P < 0.05). WHILE THE MEAN SCORE OF THE STUDENTS FROM THE SCS WAS 3.22 +/- 0.69 IN THE PRETEST, IT INCREASED TO 3.59 (+/-0.53) IN THE POSTTEST (P < 0.05). A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIP WAS FOUND BETWEEN MINDFULNESS AND SCS SCORES (R = 0.162). PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: AFTER THE YOGA COURSE, MINDFULNESS AND SELF-COMPASSION OF THE STUDENTS WERE FOUND TO BE HIGHER THAN IT WAS BEFORE THE LESSONS. THE HIGHER THE MINDFULNESS LEVEL OF THE STUDENTS IS, THE HIGHER THE LEVEL OF SELF-COMPASSION IS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
14 1969 37 SHORT TERM EFFECT OF YOGA ASANA - AN ADJUNCT THERAPY TO CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT IN FROZEN SHOULDER. BACKGROUND: THE AVAILABLE TREATMENTS FOR FROZEN SHOULDER YIELD VARIABLE RESULTS. PHYSICAL THERAPY AND ANALGESICS ARE CONSIDERED AS THE FIRST-LINE TREATMENT FOR THIS DISORDER, BUT THE EFFECTS ARE NOT UNIFORM. THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT THAT ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE MAY HAVE A ROLE IN ITS MANAGEMENT. OBJECTIVE(S): THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO EXAMINE THE SHORT-TERM EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH FROZEN SHOULDER OF MILD TO MODERATE SEVERITY. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS CONDUCTED ON PATIENTS WITH FROZEN SHOULDER BETWEEN 30 AND 60 YEARS OF AGE. THEY WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: YOGA (Y) AND CONTROL (NY). A SET OF ASANA EXERCISES CALLED "STANDING GROUP OF ASANA" WAS PRACTICED BY THE YOGA GROUP IN ADDITION TO THE CONVENTIONAL THERAPY AS RECEIVED BY THE CONTROL GROUP. THE PATIENTS WERE REVIEWED AT 1, 2 AND 4 WEEKS. THE PAIN AND FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT WERE DONE AT BASELINE AND AT EACH REVIEW USING THE SHOULDER PAIN AND DISABILITY INDEX (SPADI). RESULTS: THERE WERE 16 MALE AND 20 FEMALE PARTICIPANTS IN THE Y GROUP, AND 15 MALES AND 21 FEMALES IN THE NY GROUP. THERE WAS NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN AGE, SEX, AND PRE-TREATMENT SPADI SCORE BETWEEN THE GROUPS. AT THE END OF THE FOUR WEEKS, THE SPADI PAIN SCORES IN THE Y AND NY GROUP WERE 20.47 AND 20.14, RESPECTIVELY (P = 0.666). THE SPADI DISABILITY SCORES IN THE Y AND NY GROUP WERE 20.4 AND 19.7, RESPECTIVELY (P = 0.599). OVERALL SPADI SCORES WERE 40.67 AND 40.03 IN THE Y AND NY GROUP, RESPECTIVELY (P = 0.736). BOTH GROUPS HAD A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SPADI PAIN AND DISABILITY SCORES. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GROUPS IN TERMS OF SPADI SCORES. CONCLUSION: THE EFFECT OF THE STANDING GROUP OF ASANA HAS NO ADDED ADVANTAGE RELATIVE TO STANDARD FROZEN SHOULDER TREATMENT WHEN PRACTICED FOR ONE MONTH.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                              
15 1893 30 RELAXATION RESPONSE-BASED YOGA IMPROVES FUNCTIONING IN YOUNG CHILDREN WITH AUTISM: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVES: THE STUDY OBJECTIVES WERE TO DEVELOP AND OBJECTIVELY ASSESS THE THERAPEUTIC EFFECT OF A NOVEL MOVEMENT-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE APPROACH FOR CHILDREN WITH AN AUTISM-SPECTRUM DISORDER (ASD). DESIGN: A WITHIN-SUBJECT ANALYSIS COMPARING PRE- TO POST-TREATMENT SCORES ON TWO STANDARD MEASURES OF CHILDHOOD BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS WAS USED. SETTINGS AND LOCATION: THE INTERVENTION AND DATA ANALYSIS OCCURRED AT A TERTIARY CARE, MEDICAL SCHOOL TEACHING HOSPITAL. SUBJECTS: TWENTY-FOUR (24) CHILDREN AGED 3-16 YEARS WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF AN ASD COMPRISED THE STUDY GROUP. INTERVENTION: THE EFFICACY OF AN 8-WEEK MULTIMODAL YOGA, DANCE, AND MUSIC THERAPY PROGRAM BASED ON THE RELAXATION RESPONSE (RR) WAS DEVELOPED AND EXAMINED. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE STUDY OUTCOME WAS MEASURED USING THE BEHAVIORAL ASSESSMENT SYSTEM FOR CHILDREN, SECOND EDITION (BASC-2) AND THE ABERRANT BEHAVIORAL CHECKLIST (ABC). RESULTS: ROBUST CHANGES WERE FOUND ON THE BASC-2, PRIMARILY FOR 5-12-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN. UNEXPECTEDLY, THE POST-TREATMENT SCORES ON THE ATYPICALITY SCALE OF THE BASC-2, WHICH MEASURES SOME OF THE CORE FEATURES OF AUTISM, CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY (P=0.003). CONCLUSIONS: A MOVEMENT-BASED, MODIFIED RR PROGRAM, INVOLVING YOGA AND DANCE, SHOWED EFFICACY IN TREATING BEHAVIORAL AND SOME CORE FEATURES OF AUTISM, PARTICULARLY FOR LATENCY-AGE CHILDREN.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
16  535 23 COMPARISON OF YOGA VERSUS PHYSICAL EXERCISE ON EXECUTIVE FUNCTION, ATTENTION, AND WORKING MEMORY IN ADOLESCENT SCHOOLCHILDREN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. PURPOSE: EXECUTIVE FUNCTION, ATTENTION, AND MEMORY ARE AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF COGNITIVE HEALTH IN CHILDREN. IN THIS STUDY, WE ANALYZE THE EFFECT OF YOGA AND PHYSICAL EXERCISE ON EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING, ATTENTION, AND MEMORY. METHODS: IN THIS PROSPECTIVE TWO-ARMED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, AROUND 802 STUDENTS FROM TEN SCHOOLS ACROSS FOUR DISTRICTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE DAILY 1 H YOGA TRAINING (N = 411) OR PHYSICAL EXERCISE (N = 391) FOR 2 MONTHS. EXECUTIVE FUNCTION, ATTENTION, AND MEMORY WERE STUDIED USING TRAIL MAKING TEST (TMT). YOGA (N = 377) AND PHYSICAL EXERCISE (N = 371) STUDENTS CONTRIBUTED DATA TO THE ANALYSES. THE DATA WERE ANALYZED USING INTENTION-TO-TREAT APPROACH USING STUDENT'S T-TEST. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN NUMERICAL TMT (TMTN) VALUES WITHIN YOGA (T = -2.17; P < 0.03) AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (PA) (T = -3.37; P < 0.001) GROUPS FOLLOWING INTERVENTIONAL PERIOD. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN TMTN BETWEEN YOGA AND PA GROUPS (T = 0.44; P = 0.66). THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN ALPHABETICAL TMT (TMTA) VALUES WITHIN YOGA (T = 6.21; P < 0.00) AND PA GROUPS (T = 1.19; P < 0.234) FOLLOWING INTERVENTIONAL PERIOD. HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN TMTA BETWEEN YOGA AND PA GROUPS (T = 3.46; P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA IMPROVES EXECUTIVE FUNCTION, ATTENTION, AND WORKING MEMORY AS EFFECTIVELY AS PHYSICAL EXERCISE INTERVENTION IN ADOLESCENT SCHOOLCHILDREN.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
17 2814 23 YOGA TRAINING AND MOTOR SPEED BASED ON A FINGER TAPPING TASK. A FINGER TAPPING TASK WAS USED TO ASSESS MOTOR SPEED (MS) OF BOTH HANDS IN 53 ADULTS AND 152 CHILDREN BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA TRAINING AND IN 38 ADULTS OF A NON-YOGA (CONTROL) GROUP. ALL SUBJECTS WERE RIGHT HAND DOMINANT. THE 30-SECOND TAPPING SPEED (TS) TEST WAS CONSIDERED AS THREE TIME INTERVALS, I.E. 0-10 SECOND (TS1), 10-20 SECONDS (TS2) AND 20-30 SECONDS (TS3). THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT (STUDENT'S T-TEST) INCREASE IN ALL THREE TS VALUES FOLLOWING 10 DAYS OF YOGA IN CHILDREN AND 30 DAYS OF YOGA IN ADULTS. HOWEVER FOR BOTH GROUPS AT BASELINE AND FINAL ASSESSMENTS, TS2 AND TS3 WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN TS1. HENCE THE TS WAS INCREASED AFTER YOGA TRAINING DURING THE FIRST 10-SECONDS OF THE TEST BUT NOT DURING THE NEXT 20 SECONDS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST AN INCREASE IN MOTOR SPEED FOR REPETITIVE FINGER MOVEMENTS FOLLOWING YOGA TRAINING, BUT NOT IN STRENGTH OR ENDURANCE, AS THE INCREASE WAS NOT SUSTAINED OVER 30 SEC.	1999	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
18  331 25 APPLICATION OF INTEGRATED YOGA THERAPY TO INCREASE IMITATION SKILLS IN CHILDREN WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER. BACKGROUND/AIM: CHILDREN WITH AUTISM EXHIBIT SIGNIFICANT DEFICITS IN IMITATION SKILLS, WHICH IMPEDE THE ACQUISITION OF MORE COMPLEX BEHAVIOR AND SOCIALIZATION. IMITATION IS OFTEN TARGETED EARLY IN INTERVENTION PLANS AND CONTINUES TO BE ADDRESSED THROUGHOUT THE CHILD'S TREATMENT. THE USE OF INTEGRATED APPROACH TO YOGA THERAPY (IAYT) AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR CHILDREN DIAGNOSED WITH AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER (ASD) IS RARELY REPORTED AND LITTLE IS KNOWN ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SUCH THERAPIES. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED IAYT AS A TREATMENT METHOD WITH CHILDREN WITH ASD TO INCREASE IMITATIVE SKILLS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PARENTS AND SIX CHILDREN WITH ASD PARTICIPATED IN A 10-MONTH PROGRAM OF 5-WEEKLY SESSIONS AND REGULAR PRACTICE AT HOME. PRE, MID AND POST TREATMENT ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED OBSERVERS AND PARENT RATINGS OF CHILDREN'S IMITATION SKILLS IN TASKS RELATED TO IMITATION SKILLS SUCH AS GROSS MOTOR ACTIONS, VOCALIZATION, COMPLEX IMITATION, ORAL FACIAL MOVEMENTS AND IMITATING BREATHING EXERCISES. RESULTS: IMPROVEMENT IN CHILDREN'S IMITATION SKILLS ESPECIALLY POINTING TO BODY, POSTURAL AND ORAL FACIAL MOVEMENTS. PARENTS REPORTED CHANGE IN THE PLAY PATTERN OF THESE CHILDREN WITH TOYS, PEERS AND OBJECTS AT HOME. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY INDICATES THAT IAYT MAY OFFER BENEFITS AS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL TO INCREASE IMITATION, COGNITIVE SKILLS AND SOCIAL-COMMUNICATIVE BEHAVIORS IN CHILDREN WITH ASD. IN ADDITION, CHILDREN EXHIBITED INCREASED SKILLS IN EYE CONTACT, SITTING TOLERANCE, NON-VERBAL COMMUNICATION AND RECEPTIVE SKILLS TO VERBAL COMMANDS RELATED TO SPATIAL RELATIONSHIP.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
19 1131 28 EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR MENTAL PERFORMANCE IN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. BACKGROUND: WITH GROWING SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE, YOGA IS EMERGING AS AN IMPORTANT HEALTH BEHAVIOR-LIFESTYLE MODIFYING MODULE TO ACHIEVE HOLISTIC HEALTH AT PHYSICAL, MENTAL, EMOTIONAL, SOCIAL AND SPIRITUAL LEVELS. BRAIN WAVE COHERENCE (BWC) RECORDINGS FROM THE SURFACE OF THE SKULL ARE ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT COGNITIVE PROCESSES AND PLAYS BOTH CRITICAL AND USEFUL ROLES IN YOGA WITH WIDE RANGE OF FUNCTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE. THE PSYCHO-PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES THAT CHARACTERIZE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR BETTER MENTAL PERFORMANCE IN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS HAVE NOT BEEN STUDIED ADEQUATELY. OBJECTIVE: THE STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO ASSESS THE MENTAL PERFORMANCE THROUGH BWC ANALYSIS IN UNIVERSITY STUDENTS UNDERGOING INTEGRATED YOGA MODULE (IYM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE IYM SUBJECTS (N=30) WITH 25.77+/-4.85 YEARS OF MEAN AGE PARTICIPATED IN THIS SINGLE GROUP PRE-POST STUDY. THE BWC DATA WAS COLLECTED BEFORE (PRE) AND AFTER (POST) THE 21 DAYS IYM USING BRAIN MASTER (MODEL: 2E PART # 390-001), MICHIGAN, USA. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: MEANS, STANDARD DEVIATIONS, KOLMOGOROV-SMIRNOV TEST AND WILCOXON SIGNED RANK TEST WERE USED FOR ANALYZING DATA WITH THE HELP OF SPSS-16. RESULTS: A COMPLETE STATISTICAL AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS SHOWED 43.24% INCREASE (P<0.001) IN DELTA, 9.13% INCREASE (P=0.289) IN THETA, 57.85% INCREASE (P<0.001) IN ALPHA, 17.65% DECREASE (P=0.136) IN BETA AND 9.19% INCREASE (P=0.586) IN GAMMA BWC BETWEEN PRE AND POST INTERVENTION MEASUREMENTS. CONCLUSION: BWC STUDY SHOWED SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN BOTH DELTA AND ALPHA WAVE COHERENCE SUGGESTING THAT IYM CAN RESULT IN IMPROVEMENT OF COHERENT AND INTEGRATED BRAIN FUNCTIONING AMONG STUDENTS, THUS PAVING THE WAY FOR THEIR BETTER MENTAL PERFORMANCE. ALTHOUGH THIS PRELIMINARY RESEARCH IS PROMISING, MORE WELL-DESIGNED STUDIES ARE NEEDED BEFORE A STRONG RECOMMENDATION CAN BE MADE.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
20 2757 21 YOGA PRACTICES AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING OF STUDENT NURSES. YOGA HAS BEEN WITH US SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL, BUT IT IS ONLY DURING RECENT YEARS THAT IT HAS ASSUMED WORLDWIDE IMPORTANCE. THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE CT OF SELECTED YOGA PRACTICES ON PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING. IN THIS QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL ONE GROUP PRE-TEST AND POST- TEST STUDY, 83 UNDER GRADUATE STUDENT NURSES. WERE TAUGHT SELECTED YOGA EXERCISES. THE SE- LECTED YOGA EXERCISES WERE SYSTEMATIC RELAXATION, BREATHING, AND STRETCHING THAT WERE PER- FORMED IN THE FORMATIVE MANNER. THE' INTERVENTION WAS CARRIED OUT FOR THE MINIMAL DURATION OF ONE HOUR PER DAY, THREE DAYS A WEEK FOR A PERIOD OF 6 WEEKS. ASSESSMENT WAS- CARRIED OUT ON THE FIRST AND LAST- DAY OF THE INTERVENTION, USING-A MODIFIED HINDI VERSION OF POSITIVE AFFECT AND NEGATIVE AFFECT SCALE, (PANAS-H). IT,HAS 10 QUESTIONS EACH TO MEASURE POSITIVE (PA) AND NEGA- TIVE AFFECT (NA). SINCE THE DATA WAS TESTED AND FORMED A NORMAL DISTRIBUTION, THE PAIRED 'T' TEST WAS USED FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. THE. MEAN PA SCORE OF 42.92 AFTER YOGA PRACTICE WAS STATISTI- CALLY HIGHER THAN THE MEAN PA SCORE OF 32. 50 BEFORE YOGA PRACTICE (P=O. 01). THE MEAN NA SCORE OF 20.75 AFTER YOGA PRACTICE WAS LOWER THAN THE MEAN NA SCORE OF 23.33 BEFORE YOGA PRACTICE (P=0.427). THE YOGA PRACTICE CAN BE TAUGHT TO NORMALPARTICIPANTS AS IT MAY REDUCE NEGATIVE AFFECT AND INCREASE THE POSITIVE AFFECT WITHIN A FEW WEEKS.	2015

1 2588 169 YOGA FOR IMPROVING SLEEP QUALITY AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR OLDER ADULTS. CONTEXT: THE AGING PROCESS IS ASSOCIATED WITH PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES THAT AFFECT SLEEP. IN OLDER ADULTS, UNDIAGNOSED AND UNTREATED INSOMNIA MAY CAUSE IMPAIRED DAILY FUNCTION AND REDUCED QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). INSOMNIA IS ALSO A RISK FACTOR FOR ACCIDENTS AND FALLS THAT ARE THE MAIN CAUSE OF ACCIDENTAL DEATHS IN OLDER ADULTS AND, THEREFORE, IS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY RATES IN OLDER POPULATIONS. OBJECTIVES: THE RESEARCH TEAM AIMED TO (1) EXAMINE THE EFFICACY OF A YOGA INTERVENTION (YI) FOR THE TREATMENT OF INSOMNIA IN OLDER ADULTS, (2) DETERMINE THE ABILITY OF YOGA TO ENHANCE THE QOL OF OLDER ADULTS, AND (3) ESTABLISH THE APPLICABILITY OF YOGA PRACTICE FOR OLDER PEOPLE IN A WESTERN CULTURAL SETTING. DESIGN: A WAITING-LIST CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTINGS * THE STUDY TOOK PLACE IN JERUSALEM, ISRAEL, FROM 2008-2009. PARTICIPANTS: PARTICIPANTS WERE OLDER MEN AND WOMEN (AGE >/= 60 Y) WITH INSOMNIA. INTERVENTION: THE YI GROUP PARTICIPATED IN 12 WK OF CLASSES, HELD 2 X/WK, INCORPORATING YOGA POSTURES, MEDITATIVE YOGA, AND DAILY HOME PRACTICE OF MEDITATIVE YOGA. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE STUDY USED SELF-REPORT ASSESSMENTS OF SLEEP QUALITY USING THE FOLLOWING: (1) SLEEP QUALITY-THE KAROLINSKA SLEEPINESS SCALE (KSS), THE EPWORTH SLEEPINESS SCALE (ESS), AND THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI), AND DAILY SLEEP AND PRACTICE LOGS; (2) MOOD STATES-THE DEPRESSION ANXIETY STRESS SCALE LONG FORM (DASS-42) AND THE PROFILE OF MOOD STATES SHORT FORM (POMS-SF); (3) A HEALTH SURVEY (SF-36); AND (4) MOBILE AT-HOME SLEEP STUDIES. RESULTS: COMPARED WITH CONTROLS, THE YI GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN A RANGE OF SUBJECTIVE FACTORS, INCLUDING OVERALL SLEEP QUALITY; SLEEP EFFICIENCY; SLEEP LATENCY AND DURATION; SELF-ASSESSED SLEEP QUALITY; FATIGUE; GENERAL WELL-BEING; DEPRESSION; ANXIETY; STRESS; TENSION; ANGER; VITALITY; AND FUNCTION IN PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, AND SOCIAL ROLES. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA WAS SHOWN TO BE SAFE AND IMPROVED SLEEP AND QOL IN A GROUP OF OLDER ADULTS WITH INSOMNIA. OUTCOMES DEPENDED ON PRACTICE COMPLIANCE.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
2 2794  27 YOGA THERAPY FOR MEDICALLY UNEXPLAINED PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS. MEDICALLY UNEXPLAINED PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS (MUPS) IS A COMMON, YET NEGLECTED DISEASE WITH A PREVALENCE OF AROUND 25% IN PRIMARY CARE SETTING. THESE PATIENTS PRESENT WITH MULTIPLE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS, WITHOUT AN UNDERLYING DIAGNOSIS, HAMPERING THEIR FUNCTIONAL AND MENTAL WELLBEING. THE MANAGEMENT OF THESE UNDIAGNOSED SYMPTOMS THROUGH CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT HAS NOT BEEN ENCOURAGING. PATIENTS SHUTTLE BETWEEN DIFFERENT SPECIALITIES, SEEKING A DIAGNOSIS FOR THEIR SYMPTOMS, MAKING THEM DISSATISFIED AND INCREASING HEALTHCARE BURDEN. YOGA, AS AN ADJUNCT THERAPY HAS SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF MUPS RELATED DISORDERS SUCH AS SOMATOFORM DISORDER, IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME (IBS) AND DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY. THUS, WE SUGGEST AN INTEGRATED YOGA MODULE WHICH MIGHT HELP IN IMPROVING BOTH PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIABLE IN MUPS PATIENTS AND IMPROVING THEIR OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE. FURTHERMORE, THE GAP IN THE LITERATURE ON THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN IMPROVING MUPS, CAN BE ADDRESSED BY PLANNING A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL BASED ON THE SUGGESTED YOGA MODULE.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
3 2424  30 YOGA AND MUSIC INTERVENTION TO REDUCE DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND STRESS DURING COVID-19 OUTBREAK ON HEALTHCARE WORKERS. AIM: TO INVESTIGATE IMPACT OF YOGA AND MUSIC INTERVENTION ON ANXIETY, STRESS, AND DEPRESSION LEVELS OF HEALTH CARE WORKERS DURING THE COVID-19 OUTBREAK. METHODS: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO ASSESS PSYCHOLOGICAL RESPONSES OF 240 HEALTHCARE WORKERS DURING COVID-19 OUTBREAK. WE USED YOGA AND MUSIC INTERVENTION IN NORMAL AND ABNORMAL SUBJECTS BASED ON DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND STRESS SCALE-42 (DASS-42). RESULTS: OF ALL 209 PARTICIPANTS, 105 (50.23%) HAD SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION (35.88%), ANXIETY (40.19), AND STRESS (34.92%) ALONE OR IN COMBINATION. THE DATA SUGGEST THAT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN TEST SCORES AFTER INTERVENTION. MAJORITY OF PERSONS WITH ABNORMAL SCORE EXHIBITED IMPROVED DASS-42 SCORE ON COMBINED INTERVENTIONS OF YOGA AND MUSIC COMPARED TO CONTROL GROUP. EVEN SUBJECTS WITHOUT ABNORMALITIES ON DASS-42 SCORE ALSO SHOWED IMPROVED DASS-42 SCORES IN INTERVENTION (N = 52) GROUP COMPARED TO NONINTERVENTION (N = 52) GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: OUR FINDINGS HIGHLIGHTED THE SIGNIFICANCE OF EASILY AVAILABLE, SIMPLE, INEXPENSIVE, SAFE NONPHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS LIKE YOGA AND MUSIC THERAPY TO OVERCOME STRESS, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION IN PRESENT TIMES.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
4 2631  24 YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF INSOMNIA AMONG CANCER PATIENTS: EVIDENCE, MECHANISMS OF ACTION, AND CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS. UP TO 90% OF CANCER PATIENTS REPORT SYMPTOMS OF INSOMNIA DURING AND AFTER TREATMENT. SYMPTOMS OF INSOMNIA INCLUDE EXCESSIVE DAYTIME SLEEPINESS, DIFFICULTY FALLING ASLEEP, DIFFICULTY STAYING ASLEEP, AND WAKING UP TOO EARLY. INSOMNIA SYMPTOMS ARE AMONG THE MOST PREVALENT, DISTRESSING AND PERSISTENT CANCER- AND CANCER TREATMENT-RELATED TOXICITIES REPORTED BY PATIENTS, AND CAN BE SEVERE ENOUGH TO INCREASE CANCER MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY. DESPITE THE UBIQUITY OF INSOMNIA SYMPTOMS, THEY ARE UNDER-SCREENED, UNDER-DIAGNOSED, AND UNDER-TREATED IN CANCER PATIENTS. WHEN INSOMNIA SYMPTOMS ARE IDENTIFIED, PROVIDERS ARE HESITANT TO PRESCRIBE, AND PATIENTS ARE HESITANT TO TAKE PHARMACEUTICALS DUE TO POLYPHARMACY CONCERNS. IN ADDITION, SLEEP MEDICATIONS DO NOT CURE INSOMNIA. YOGA IS A WELL-TOLERATED MODE OF EXERCISE WITH PROMISING EVIDENCE FOR ITS EFFICACY IN IMPROVING INSOMNIA SYMPTOMS AMONG CANCER PATIENTS. THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS EXISTING CLINICAL RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR TREATING INSOMNIA AMONG CANCER PATIENTS. THE ARTICLE ALSO PROVIDES CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PRESCRIBING YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF INSOMNIA IN THIS POPULATION.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
5 1820  37 PROTOCOL FOR A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY OF IYENGAR YOGA FOR YOUTH WITH IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME. INTRODUCTION: IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME AFFECTS AS MANY AS 14% OF HIGH SCHOOL-AGED STUDENTS. SYMPTOMS INCLUDE DISCOMFORT IN THE ABDOMEN, ALONG WITH DIARRHEA AND/OR CONSTIPATION AND OTHER GASTROENTEROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS THAT CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT QUALITY OF LIFE AND DAILY FUNCTIONING. EMOTIONAL STRESS APPEARS TO EXACERBATE IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME SYMPTOMS SUGGESTING THAT MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS REDUCING AROUSAL MAY PROVE BENEFICIAL. FOR MANY SUFFERERS, SYMPTOMS CAN BE TRACED TO CHILDHOOD AND ADOLESCENCE, MAKING THE EARLY MANIFESTATION OF IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND. THE CURRENT STUDY WILL FOCUS ON YOUNG PEOPLE AGED 14-26 YEARS WITH IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME. THE STUDY WILL TEST THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF IYENGAR YOGA ON CLINICAL SYMPTOMS, PSYCHOSPIRITUAL FUNCTIONING AND VISCERAL SENSITIVITY. YOGA IS THOUGHT TO BRING PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SPIRITUAL BENEFITS TO PRACTITIONERS AND HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED STRESS AND PAIN. THROUGH ITS FOCUS ON RESTORATION AND USE OF PROPS, IYENGAR YOGA IS ESPECIALLY DESIGNED TO DECREASE AROUSAL AND PROMOTE PSYCHOSPIRITUAL RESOURCES IN PHYSICALLY COMPROMISED INDIVIDUALS. AN EXTENSIVE AND STANDARDIZED TEACHER-TRAINING PROGRAM SUPPORT IYENGAR YOGA'S RELIABILITY AND SAFETY. IT IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT YOGA WILL BE FEASIBLE WITH LESS THAN 20% ATTRITION; AND THE YOGA GROUP WILL DEMONSTRATE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED OUTCOMES COMPARED TO CONTROLS, WITH PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOSPIRITUAL MECHANISMS CONTRIBUTING TO IMPROVEMENTS. METHODS/DESIGN: SIXTY IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME PATIENTS AGED 14-26 WILL BE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A STANDARDIZED 6-WEEK TWICE WEEKLY IYENGAR YOGA GROUP-BASED PROGRAM OR A WAIT-LIST USUAL CARE CONTROL GROUP. THE GROUPS WILL BE COMPARED ON THE PRIMARY CLINICAL OUTCOMES OF IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME SYMPTOMS, QUALITY OF LIFE AND GLOBAL IMPROVEMENT AT POST-TREATMENT AND 2-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. SECONDARY OUTCOMES WILL INCLUDE VISCERAL PAIN SENSITIVITY ASSESSED WITH A STANDARDIZED LABORATORY TASK (WATER LOAD TASK), FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY AND PSYCHOSPIRITUAL VARIABLES INCLUDING CATASTROPHIZING, SELF-EFFICACY, MOOD, ACCEPTANCE AND MINDFULNESS. MECHANISMS OF ACTION INVOLVED IN THE PROPOSED BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA UPON CLINICAL OUTCOMES WILL BE EXPLORED, AND INCLUDE THE MEDIATING EFFECTS OF VISCERAL SENSITIVITY, INCREASED PSYCHOSPIRITUAL RESOURCES, REGULATED AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM RESPONSES AND REGULATED HORMONAL STRESS RESPONSE ASSESSED VIA SALIVARY CORTISOL.

6 2468  33 YOGA AS A THERAPY FOR IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME. THE AIM OF THIS STATE-OF-THE-ART NARRATIVE REVIEW IS TO EVALUATE THE CURRENT EVIDENCE ABOUT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AS THERAPY FOR IBS AND EXPLORE ITS POTENTIAL MECHANISMS OF ACTION. THE CURRENT LITERATURE SUGGESTS YOGA IS EFFECTIVE AND SAFE AND MAY TARGET MULTIPLE MECHANISMS INVOLVED IN TREATMENT OF IBS. EVIDENCE FROM RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS IDENTIFIED YOGA AS MORE EFFECTIVE COMPARED TO PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT AND EQUALLY EFFECTIVE AS DIETARY INTERVENTIONS OR MODERATE-INTENSITY WALKING. IMPROVEMENTS WERE SEEN IN BOTH PHYSICAL HEALTH (IBS SYMPTOM SEVERITY, GASTRIC MOTILITY, AUTONOMIC AND SOMATIC SYMPTOM SCORES, AND PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING) AND MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES (DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, GASTROINTESTINAL-SPECIFIC ANXIETY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE). GIVEN FAVORABLE CHANGES IN IBS-RELATED PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES, PRELIMINARY DATA SUPPORTS YOGA AS BENEFICIAL IN THIS POPULATION. HOWEVER, THE RELATIVELY LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE RESULTING FROM HETEROGENEITY OF STUDY DESIGNS, INTERVENTIONS, AND OUTCOME MEASURES LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO MAKE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT THE USE OF YOGA AS THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH IBS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
7 2503  23 YOGA AS TREATMENT FOR INSOMNIA AMONG CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. MANY CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS, BETWEEN 15 TO 90%, REPORT SOME FORM OF INSOMNIA OR SLEEP QUALITY IMPAIRMENT DURING AND POST-TREATMENT, SUCH AS EXCESSIVE DAYTIME NAPPING, DIFFICULTY FALLING ASLEEP, DIFFICULTY STAYING ASLEEP, AND WAKING UP TOO EARLY. INSOMNIA AND SLEEP QUALITY IMPAIRMENT ARE AMONG THE MOST PREVALENT AND DISTRESSING PROBLEMS REPORTED BY CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS, AND CAN BE SEVERE ENOUGH TO INCREASE CANCER MORTALITY. DESPITE THE UBIQUITY OF INSOMNIA AND SLEEP QUALITY IMPAIRMENT, THEY ARE UNDER-DIAGNOSED AND UNDER-TREATED IN CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS. WHEN SLEEP PROBLEMS ARE PRESENT, PROVIDERS AND PATIENTS ARE OFTEN HESITANT TO PRESCRIBE OR TAKE PHARMACEUTICALS FOR SLEEP PROBLEMS DUE TO POLY PHARMACY CONCERNS, AND COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR INSOMNIA CAN BE VERY DIFFICULT AND IMPRACTICAL FOR PATIENTS TO ADHERE TO THROUGHOUT THE CANCER EXPERIENCE. RESEARCH SUGGESTS YOGA IS A WELL-TOLERATED EXERCISE INTERVENTION WITH PROMISING EVIDENCE FOR ITS EFFICACY IN IMPROVING INSOMNIA AND SLEEP QUALITY IMPAIRMENT AMONG SURVIVORS. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF EXISTING CLINICAL RESEARCH ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR TREATING INSOMNIA AND SLEEP QUALITY IMPAIRMENT AMONG CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
8 1035  33 EFFECTS OF YOGA IN INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASES AND ON FREQUENT IBD-ASSOCIATED EXTRAINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS LIKE FATIGUE AND DEPRESSION. QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) OF PERSONS WITH INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASES (IBD) IS OFTEN IMPAIRED BY SYMPTOMS THAT DO NOT PRIMARILY RELATE TO INTESTINAL INFLAMMATION. AMONG THE MOST CHALLENGING EXTRAINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS ARE DEPRESSION AND FATIGUE, WHICH ARE ALSO FREQUENT IN OTHER CHRONIC DISEASES LIKE MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS AND CANCER. YOGA AS AN ANCIENT INDIAN TRADITION CONTAINING POSTURES, BREATHING EXERCISES AND MEDITATION MAY POSITIVELY INFLUENCE THOSE SYMPTOMS. THIS REVIEW EVALUATES THE CURRENT LITERATURE WITH REGARD TO THE EFFECT OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS IN PERSONS WITH IBD AND WITH REGARD TO QOL, DEPRESSION AND FATIGUE IN OTHER SOMATIC DISORDERS. A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE SEARCH YIELDED THREE TRIALS EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH IBD AND 37 TRIALS ADDRESSING DEPRESSIVE SYNDROMES OR FATIGUE IN SOMATIC DISORDERS. IN SUMMARY, BOTH IN-PERSON AND VIDEO-BASED YOGA CLASSES ARE FEASIBLE, ACCEPTABLE AND SAFE AS COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT IN PATIENTS WITH IBD AND SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE ANXIETY AND IMPAIRED QUALITY OF LIFE. CURRENT LITERATURE DOES NOT PROVIDE INFORMATION ON THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON DEPRESSION AND FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH IBD, BUT RESEARCH FROM OTHER SOMATIC DISORDERS OR PATIENTS WITH DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS IMPLIES THE POTENTIAL OF YOGA IN THIS REGARD FOR PERSONS WITH IBD. THIS SHOULD BE SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED IN INTERVENTIONAL TRIALS WITH STANDARDIZED YOGA MODULES INCLUDING PATIENTS WITH IBD SUFFERING FROM FATIGUE, DEPRESSION AND/OR IMPAIRED QOL.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
9 2031  50 TAILORED INDIVIDUAL YOGA PRACTICE IMPROVES SLEEP QUALITY, FATIGUE, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION IN CHRONIC INSOMNIA DISORDER. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC INSOMNIA DISORDER (CI) IS A PREVALENT SLEEP DISORDER THAT CAN LEAD TO DISTURBED DAYTIME FUNCTIONING AND IS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. FIRST-CHOICE TREATMENT IS COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT-I). OTHER MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS TAI-CHI AND YOGA, HAVE DEMONSTRATED SUBJECTIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN SLEEP QUALITY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR IMPROVEMENT OF SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE SLEEP QUALITY AS WELL AS MEASURES OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, SLEEPINESS, AND FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH CI. METHODS: ADULTS WITH CI WERE PROSPECTIVELY INCLUDED IN THIS SINGLE GROUP PRE-POST STUDY. BASELINE ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED HOME POLYSOMNOGRAPHY (PSG), 7-DAY ACTIGRAPHY, AND QUESTIONNAIRES (PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX QUESTIONNAIRE (PSQI), HOSPITAL ANXIETY DEPRESSION SCALE (HADS), EPWORTH SLEEPINESS SCALE (ESS), PICHOT FATIGUE SCALE (PS)). PATIENTS PRACTICED VINIYOGA, AN INDIVIDUALISED YOGA PRACTICE WITH DAILY SELF-ADMINISTERED EXERCISES, FOR 14 WEEKS. ASSESSMENTS WERE REPEATED AT THE END OF YOGA PRACTICE. RESULTS: TWENTY-ONE PATIENTS COMPLETED THE STUDY. OBJECTIVE SLEEP MEASUREMENTS REVEALED NO CHANGE IN PSG PARAMETERS AFTER YOGA PRACTICE, BUT A DECREASE IN AROUSALS ON ACTIGRAPHY (P < 0.001). SUBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS IMPROVED FOR ALL QUESTIONNAIRES (PSQI, P < 0.001; HAD-A, P = 0.020, HAD-D, P = 0.001, ESS, P = 0.041, PS, P = 0.010). IN UNIVARIATE CORRELATIONS, DECREASE IN PSQI WAS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASE IN SLEEP STAGE N3 (P < 0.001) ON PSG. CONCLUSIONS: WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED A POSITIVE IMPACT OF INDIVIDUALIZED YOGA PRACTICE ON SUBJECTIVE PARAMETERS RELATED TO SLEEP AND DAYTIME SYMPTOMS IN CI, RESULTING IN FEWER AROUSALS ON ACTIGRAPHY. YOGA COULD BE PROPOSED AS A POTENTIALLY USEFUL ALTERNATIVE TO CBT-I IN CI, AS IT IS EASY TO PRACTICE AUTONOMOUSLY OVER THE LONG-TERM. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE DESIGN OF THE PRESENT STUDY, FUTURE PROSPECTIVE CONTROLLED STUDIES SHOULD FIRST CONFIRM OUR RESULTS.

10  526  34 COMPARISON OF LAUGHTER YOGA AND ANTI-ANXIETY MEDICATION ON ANXIETY AND GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS OF PATIENTS WITH IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME. BACKGROUND IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME (IBS) IS THE MOST COMMON CHRONIC GASTROINTESTINAL (GI) DISORDER. PATIENTS WITH IBS USUALLY SUFFER FROM ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. A COMBINATION OF PSYCHOLOGICAL APPROACHES AND PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENTS CAN BE A SIGNIFICANTLY EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR IBS. THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO PROVIDE A THERAPEUTIC PLAN BASED ON LAUGHTER YOGA AND ANTI-ANXIETY MEDICATION, EMPLOYED FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME, AND TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE TREATMENTS ON THE ANXIETY AND GI SYMPTOMS OF PATIENTS WITH IBS. METHODS IN THIS RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED, CLINICAL TRIAL, THE PARTICIPANTS WERE 60 PATIENTS SELECTED FROM THOSE WHO REFERRED TO THE GI CLINIC OF VALI-ASR HOSPITAL (BIRJAND, IRAN) DURING THE STUDY PERIOD (APRIL 2017 TO MARCH 2017) AND WERE DIAGNOSED AS HAVING IBS BASED ON ROME III CRITERIA. THE PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER THE LAUGHTER YOGA GROUP, THE ANTI-ANXIETY MEDICATION GROUP, OR THE SYMPTOMATIC TREATMENT (CONTROL) GROUP. SEVERITY LEVELS OF ANXIETY AND GI SYMPTOMS BEFORE AND AFTER INTERVENTION WERE DETERMINED AND COMPARED AMONG THESE THREE GROUPS ACCORDING TO APPROVED PROTOCOLS. RESULTS THE SEVERITY OF IBS SYMPTOMS AFTER THE INTERVENTIONS WAS MORE GREATLY REDUCED IN THE LAUGHTER YOGA GROUP THAN IN THE ANTI-ANXIETY MEDICATION AND CONTROL GROUPS (P = 0.006). THE SEVERITY OF ANXIETY AFTER INTERVENTIONS DECREASED IN ALL THREE GROUPS, ESPECIALLY IN THE YOGA TREATMENT GROUP, BUT THE DIFFERENCE WAS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P = 0.1). CONCLUSION LAUGHTER YOGA IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN ANTI-ANXIETY MEDICATION IN REDUCING THE GI SYMPTOMS OF PATIENTS WITH IBS. THEREFORE, APPLYING LAUGHTER YOGA ALONG WITH COMMON PHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPIES FOR PATIENTS WITH IBS MIGHT BE STRONGLY ADVISED.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
11 1526  43 IYENGAR YOGA FOR ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS WITH IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME. OBJECTIVES: IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME (IBS) IS A CHRONIC, DISABLING CONDITION THAT GREATLY COMPROMISES PATIENT FUNCTIONING. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF A 6-WEEK TWICE PER WEEK IYENGAR YOGA (IY) PROGRAM ON IBS SYMPTOMS IN ADOLESCENTS AND YOUNG ADULTS (YA) WITH IBS COMPARED WITH A USUAL-CARE WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP. METHODS: ASSESSMENTS OF SYMPTOMS, GLOBAL IMPROVEMENT, PAIN, HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY, FATIGUE, AND SLEEP WERE COLLECTED PRE- AND POSTTREATMENT. WEEKLY RATINGS OF PAIN, IBS SYMPTOMS, AND GLOBAL IMPROVEMENT WERE ALSO RECORDED UNTIL 2-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. A TOTAL OF 51 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE INTERVENTION (YOGA = 29; USUAL-CARE WAITLIST = 22). RESULTS: BASELINE ATTRITION WAS 24%. ON AVERAGE, THE YOGA GROUP ATTENDED 75% OF CLASSES. ANALYSES WERE DIVIDED BY AGE GROUP. RELATIVE TO CONTROLS, ADOLESCENTS (14-17 YEARS) ASSIGNED TO YOGA REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING, WHEREAS YA (18-26 YEARS) ASSIGNED TO YOGA REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED IBS SYMPTOMS, GLOBAL IMPROVEMENT, DISABILITY, PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, SLEEP QUALITY, AND FATIGUE. ALTHOUGH ABDOMINAL PAIN INTENSITY WAS STATISTICALLY UNCHANGED, 44% OF ADOLESCENTS AND 46% OF YA REPORTED A MINIMALLY CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PAIN FOLLOWING YOGA, AND ONE-THIRD OF YA REPORTED CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT LEVELS OF GLOBAL SYMPTOM IMPROVEMENT. ANALYSIS OF THE UNCONTROLLED EFFECTS AND MAINTENANCE OF TREATMENT EFFECTS FOR ADOLESCENTS REVEALED GLOBAL IMPROVEMENT IMMEDIATELY POST-YOGA THAT WAS NOT MAINTAINED AT FOLLOW-UP. FOR YA, GLOBAL IMPROVEMENT, WORST PAIN, CONSTIPATION, AND NAUSEA WERE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED POSTYOGA, BUT ONLY GLOBAL IMPROVEMENT, WORST PAIN, AND NAUSEA MAINTAINED AT THE 2-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT A BRIEF IY INTERVENTION IS A FEASIBLE AND SAFE ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WITH IBS, LEADING TO BENEFITS IN A NUMBER OF IBS-SPECIFIC AND GENERAL FUNCTIONING DOMAINS FOR YA. THE AGE-SPECIFIC RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA INTERVENTIONS MAY BE MOST FRUITFUL WHEN DEVELOPMENTALLY TAILORED.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
12  493  19 COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR INSOMNIA, MINDFULNESS, AND YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER WITH SLEEP DISTURBANCE: A LITERATURE REVIEW. THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSED WITH SLEEP DISTURBANCE HAS GROWN SUBSTANTIALLY WITHIN THE UNITED STATES OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS. MEANWHILE, THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF SLEEP DISTURBANCE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. MORE SPECIFICALLY, COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR INSOMNIA (CBT-I), MINDFULNESS, AND YOGA HAVE SHOWN TO BE 3 PROMISING TREATMENTS WITH VARYING DEGREES OF BENEFIT, SUPPORTING DATA, AND INHERENT LIMITATIONS.

13 2321  41 TREATMENT OF CHRONIC INSOMNIA WITH YOGA: A PRELIMINARY STUDY WITH SLEEP-WAKE DIARIES. THERE IS GOOD EVIDENCE FOR COGNITIVE AND PHYSIOLOGICAL AROUSAL IN CHRONIC INSOMNIA. ACCORDINGLY, CLINICAL TRIAL STUDIES OF INSOMNIA TREATMENTS AIMED AT REDUCING AROUSAL, INCLUDING RELAXATION AND MEDITATION, HAVE REPORTED POSITIVE RESULTS. YOGA IS A MULTICOMPONENT PRACTICE THAT IS ALSO KNOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING AROUSAL, ALTHOUGH IT HAS NOT BEEN WELL EVALUATED AS A TREATMENT FOR INSOMNIA. IN THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY, A SIMPLE DAILY YOGA TREATMENT WAS EVALUATED IN A CHRONIC INSOMNIA POPULATION CONSISTING OF SLEEP-ONSET AND/OR SLEEP-MAINTENANCE INSOMNIA AND PRIMARY OR SECONDARY INSOMNIA. PARTICIPANTS MAINTAINED SLEEP-WAKE DIARIES DURING A PRETREATMENT 2-WEEK BASELINE AND A SUBSEQUENT 8-WEEK INTERVENTION, IN WHICH THEY PRACTICED THE TREATMENT ON THEIR OWN FOLLOWING A SINGLE IN-PERSON TRAINING SESSION WITH SUBSEQUENT BRIEF IN-PERSON AND TELEPHONE FOLLOW-UPS. SLEEP EFFICIENCY (SE), TOTAL SLEEP TIME (TST), TOTAL WAKE TIME (TWT), SLEEP ONSET LATENCY (SOL), WAKE TIME AFTER SLEEP ONSET (WASO), NUMBER OF AWAKENINGS, AND SLEEP QUALITY MEASURES WERE DERIVED FROM SLEEP-WAKE DIARY ENTRIES AND WERE AVERAGED IN 2-WEEK INTERVALS. FOR 20 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETING THE PROTOCOL, STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE OBSERVED IN SE, TST, TWT, SOL, AND WASO AT END-TREATMENT AS COMPARED WITH PRETREATMENT VALUES.	2004

15 2300  32 THERAPEUTIC YOGA: SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) IS THE MOST COMMON AUTOIMMUNE INFLAMMATORY DEMYELINATING DISEASE OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM, AFFECTING OVER 2.3 MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE. ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS AND STROKE, THE AGE OF DISEASE ONSET IS TYPICALLY BETWEEN 20 AND 40 YEARS, WITH A HIGHER INCIDENCE IN WOMEN. INDIVIDUALS WITH MS EXPERIENCE A WIDE RANGE OF SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING DECLINING PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS (E.G., FATIGUE, IMBALANCE, SPASTICITY, CHRONIC PAIN, COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, BLADDER AND BOWEL DYSFUNCTION, VISUAL AND SPEECH IMPAIRMENTS, DEPRESSION, SENSORY DISTURBANCE, AND MOBILITY IMPAIRMENT). TO DATE, BOTH THE CAUSE OF AND CURE FOR MS REMAIN UNKNOWN. IN RECENT YEARS, MORE INDIVIDUALS WITH MS HAVE BEEN PURSUING ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF TREATMENT TO MANAGE SYMPTOMS OF THE DISEASE, INCLUDING MIND-BODY THERAPIES SUCH AS YOGA, MEDITATION, BREATHING, AND RELAXATION TECHNIQUES. IT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED THAT THE PRACTICE OF YOGA MAY BE A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE WAY OF MANAGING SYMPTOMS OF MS. THEREFORE, THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO SUMMARIZE THE MOST RELEVANT LITERATURE ON EXERCISE AND MIND-BODY MODALITIES TO TREAT MS SYMPTOMS AND, MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE BENEFITS AND POTENTIAL ROLE OF YOGA AS AN ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT OF SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH MS. THE ARTICLE ALSO DISCUSSES FUTURE DIRECTIONS FOR RESEARCH.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
16 2277  22 THE ROLES OF EXERCISE AND YOGA IN AMELIORATING DEPRESSION AS A RISK FACTOR FOR COGNITIVE DECLINE. CURRENTLY, THERE ARE NO EFFECTIVE PHARMACEUTICAL TREATMENTS TO REDUCE COGNITIVE DECLINE OR PREVENT DEMENTIA. AT THE SAME TIME, THE GLOBAL POPULATION IS AGING, AND RATES OF DEMENTIA AND MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT (MCI) ARE ON THE RISE. AS SUCH, THERE IS AN INCREASING INTEREST IN COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE INTERVENTIONS TO TREAT OR REDUCE THE RISK OF COGNITIVE DECLINE. DEPRESSION IS ONE POTENTIALLY MODIFIABLE RISK FACTOR FOR COGNITIVE DECLINE AND DEMENTIA. NOTABLY, EXERCISE AND YOGA ARE TWO INTERVENTIONS KNOWN TO BOTH REDUCE SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION AND IMPROVE COGNITIVE FUNCTION. THE CURRENT REVIEW DISCUSSES THE EFFICACY OF EXERCISE AND YOGA TO AMELIORATE DEPRESSION AND THEREBY REDUCE THE RISK OF COGNITIVE DECLINE AND POTENTIALLY PREVENT DEMENTIA. POTENTIAL MECHANISMS OF CHANGE, TREATMENT IMPLICATIONS, AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS ARE DISCUSSED.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
17  793  41 EFFECT OF YOGA IN THE THERAPY OF IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. BACKGROUND & AIMS: THIS REVIEW AIMS TO SYSTEMATICALLY SURVEY THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SYMPTOMS OF IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME (IBS), PAIN, QUALITY OF LIFE, MOOD, STRESS, AND SAFETY IN PATIENTS WITH IBS. METHODS: MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, CAM-QUEST, CAMBASE, AND INDMED WERE SCREENED THROUGH NOVEMBER 2015. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS COMPARING YOGA WITH USUAL CARE, NONPHARMACOLOGIC, OR PHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTIONS WERE ANALYZED FOR PATIENTS WITH IBS. PRIMARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND PAIN. ANXIETY, MOOD, AND SAFETY WERE DEFINED AS SECONDARY OUTCOMES. RISK OF BIAS WAS ASSESSED ACCORDING TO THE COCHRANE COLLABORATION RECOMMENDATIONS. RESULTS: SIX RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WITH A TOTAL OF 273 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS. THERE WAS EVIDENCE FOR A BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF A YOGIC INTERVENTION OVER CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT IN IBS, WITH SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED BOWEL SYMPTOMS, IBS SEVERITY, AND ANXIETY. FURTHERMORE, THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN QUALITY OF LIFE, GLOBAL IMPROVEMENT, AND PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING AFTER YOGA COMPARED WITH NO TREATMENT. TWO RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS REPORTED SAFETY DATA STATING THAT NO ADVERSE EVENTS OCCURRED. OVERALL, RISK OF BIAS OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES WAS UNCLEAR. CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW SUGGEST THAT YOGA MIGHT BE A FEASIBLE AND SAFE ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT FOR PEOPLE WITH IBS. NEVERTHELESS, NO RECOMMENDATION CAN BE MADE REGARDING YOGA AS A ROUTINE INTERVENTION FOR PATIENTS WITH IBS BECAUSE OF MAJOR FLAWS IN STUDY METHODS. MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED WITH RESPECT TO A HIGH-QUALITY STUDY DESIGN AND CONSENSUS IN CLINICAL OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS IN IBS.

18 1664  22 NATUROPATHY AND YOGA AS AN ADJUVANT FOR PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS - A CASE SERIES REPORT. HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV) IS AN INFECTION THAT POSES A GREAT THREAT TO BOTH DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. HEALTH FACILITIES OFFERING COMPLEMENTARY CARE, ALONG WITH STANDARD CARE, HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED AS A USEFUL STRATEGY TO OVERCOME THE BURDEN OF HIV AND PROMOTE QUALITY AND WELLBEING AMONG PEOPLE LIVING WITH HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). IN THIS REPORT, WE MAKE REFERENCE TO SEVEN PARTICIPANTS DIAGNOSED WITH HIV, WHO UNDERWENT NATUROPATHY AND YOGA BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION (NYLI), FOR VARYING DURATIONS, AT A SANATORIUM FOR PLWHA. THE CASES SUGGEST THAT NYLI FUNCTIONS AS AN ADJUVANT THERAPY THAT COMPLEMENTS STANDARD CARE, IMPROVES ADHERENCE AND PROMOTES HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOMES IN HIV AFFILIATED CLINICAL MARKERS, SUCH AS HAEMOGLOBIN, WEIGHT AND CD4+ COUNTS. HOWEVER, FURTHER CONTROLLED TRIALS ARE REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH WARRANTING EVIDENCE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
19  390  47 BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL-BEING IN A US HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM: A PRELIMINARY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: TO TEST FEASIBILITY OF YOGA WITHIN A HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM AND EVALUATE PREVENTIVE EFFICACY FOR PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL-BEING. METHODS: GRADE 11 OR 12 STUDENTS (N = 51) WHO REGISTERED FOR PHYSICAL EDUCATION (PE) WERE CLUSTER-RANDOMIZED BY CLASS 2:1 YOGA:PE-AS-USUAL. A KRIPALU-BASED YOGA PROGRAM OF PHYSICAL POSTURES, BREATHING EXERCISES, RELAXATION, AND MEDITATION WAS TAUGHT 2 TO 3 TIMES A WEEK FOR 10 WEEKS. SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES WERE ADMINISTERED TO STUDENTS 1 WEEK BEFORE AND AFTER. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES OF PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL-BEING WERE PROFILE OF MOOD STATES-SHORT FORM AND POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECT SCHEDULE FOR CHILDREN. ADDITIONAL MEASURES OF PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL-BEING INCLUDED PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE AND INVENTORY OF POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL ATTITUDES. SECONDARY MEASURES OF SELF-REGULATORY SKILLS INCLUDED RESILIENCE SCALE, STATE TRAIT ANGER EXPRESSION INVENTORY-2, AND CHILD ACCEPTANCE MINDFULNESS MEASURE. TO ASSESS FEASIBILITY, YOGA STUDENTS COMPLETED A PROGRAM EVALUATION. ANALYSES OF COVARIANCE WERE CONDUCTED BETWEEN GROUPS WITH BASELINE AS THE COVARIATE. RESULTS: ALTHOUGH PE-AS-USUAL STUDENTS SHOWED DECREASES IN PRIMARY OUTCOMES, YOGA STUDENTS MAINTAINED OR IMPROVED. TOTAL MOOD DISTURBANCE IMPROVED IN YOGA STUDENTS AND WORSENED IN CONTROLS (P = .015), AS DID PROFILE OF MOOD STATES-SHORT FORM (POMS-SF) TENSION-ANXIETY SUBSCALE (P = .002). ALTHOUGH POSITIVE AFFECT REMAINED UNCHANGED IN BOTH, NEGATIVE AFFECT SIGNIFICANTLY WORSENED IN CONTROLS WHILE IMPROVING IN YOGA STUDENTS (P = .006). SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT. STUDENTS RATED YOGA FAIRLY HIGH, DESPITE MODERATE ATTENDANCE. CONCLUSIONS: IMPLEMENTATION WAS FEASIBLE AND STUDENTS GENERALLY FOUND IT BENEFICIAL. ALTHOUGH NOT CAUSAL DUE TO SMALL, UNEVEN SAMPLE SIZE, THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY SUGGESTS PREVENTIVE BENEFITS IN PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL-BEING FROM KRIPALU YOGA DURING HIGH SCHOOL PE. THESE RESULTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED STUDIES OF YOGA IN SCHOOL SETTINGS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
20  576  25 DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY DISORDERS: BENEFITS OF EXERCISE, YOGA, AND MEDITATION. MANY PEOPLE WITH DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY TURN TO NONPHARMACOLOGIC AND NONCONVENTIONAL INTERVENTIONS, INCLUDING EXERCISE, YOGA, MEDITATION, TAI CHI, OR QI GONG. META-ANALYSES AND SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS HAVE SHOWN THAT THESE INTERVENTIONS CAN IMPROVE SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY DISORDERS. AS AN ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT, EXERCISE SEEMS MOST HELPFUL FOR TREATMENT-RESISTANT DEPRESSION, UNIPOLAR DEPRESSION, AND POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER. YOGA AS MONOTHERAPY OR ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY SHOWS POSITIVE EFFECTS, PARTICULARLY FOR DEPRESSION. AS AN ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY, IT FACILITATES TREATMENT OF ANXIETY DISORDERS, PARTICULARLY PANIC DISORDER. TAI CHI AND QI GONG MAY BE HELPFUL AS ADJUNCTIVE THERAPIES FOR DEPRESSION, BUT EFFECTS ARE INCONSISTENT. AS MONOTHERAPY OR AN ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY, MINDFULNESS-BASED MEDITATION HAS POSITIVE EFFECTS ON DEPRESSION, AND ITS EFFECTS CAN LAST FOR SIX MONTHS OR MORE. ALTHOUGH POSITIVE FINDINGS ARE LESS COMMON IN PEOPLE WITH ANXIETY DISORDERS, THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS ADJUNCTIVE USE. THERE ARE NO APPARENT NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS, AND THEIR GENERAL HEALTH BENEFITS JUSTIFY THEIR USE AS ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY FOR PATIENTS WITH DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY DISORDERS.	2019

1 1686 127 ORTHOREXIA NERVOSA IN YOGA PRACTITIONERS: RELATIONSHIP WITH PERSONALITY, ATTITUDES ABOUT APPEARANCE, AND YOGA ENGAGEMENT. PURPOSE: DISORDERED EATING SYMPTOMS AND A HIGH PREVALENCE OF ORTHOREXIA NERVOSA CAN BE FOUND IN YOGA PRACTITIONERS. GIVEN THAT YOGA IS INCREASINGLY USED AS A COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENT FOR EATING DISORDERS (ED), UNDERSTANDING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOGA PRACTICE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF DISORDERED EATING IS CRUCIAL TO GUIDE TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS. THE GOAL OF THIS WORK IS, THEREFORE, TO STUDY THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ORTHOREXIA NERVOSA (ON) AND POTENTIAL RISK FACTORS FOR ON, IN AN INTERNATIONAL SAMPLE OF EXPERIENCED YOGA PRACTITIONERS. METHOD: AN ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRE THAT INCLUDED SEVERAL PSYCHOMETRIC INSTRUMENTS WAS RESPONDED BY 469 YOGA PRACTITIONERS. INSTRUMENTS USED WERE THE TERUEL ORTHOREXIA SCALE, YOGA IMMERSION SCALE, PASSION SCALE, FROST MULTIDIMENSIONAL PERFECTIONISM SCALE, SELF-DISCIPLINE SCALE OF NEO-PI-R, DRIVE FOR THINNESS SCALE OF EDI, AND BELIEFS ABOUT APPEARANCE SCALE. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS, CORRELATIONAL ANALYSIS AND MULTIPLE REGRESSION WERE USED TO EVALUATE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ON AND THE OTHER VARIABLES. RESULTS: THE MAIN PREDICTORS OF ORTHOREXIA NERVOSA WERE THE DRIVE FOR THINNESS AND A HEALTHY ORTHOREXIA, SUGGESTING THAT, LIKE IN ANOREXIA AND BULIMIA, ORTHOREXIC INDIVIDUALS ARE ALSO CONCERNED WITH FOOD QUANTITY AND PHYSICAL APPEARANCE, RATHER THAN JUST FOOD QUALITY. CONCLUSIONS: THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA ON EATING BEHAVIOURS AND ATTITUDES OF LONG-TERM PRACTITIONERS, PARTICULARLY THE HIGH PREVALENCE OF ORTHOREXIA NERVOSA AND THE CONCERN FOR PHYSICAL APPEARANCE, SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN USING YOGA AS PREVENTION OR TREATMENT FOR EATING DISORDERS. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: LEVEL V, DESCRIPTIVE CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
2  653  20 EATING DISORDERS, EMBODIMENT, AND YOGA: A CONCEPTUAL OVERVIEW. YOGA AND ITS RELATION TO EMBODIMENT AND DISORDERED EATING HAS ONLY RECENTLY RECEIVED RESEARCH ATTENTION. NEVERTHELESS, EARLY RESEARCH INDICATES THAT YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF EATING DISORDERS. IT IS ASSUMED THAT YOGA AMELIORATES EATING DISORDER SYMPTOMS AND FACILITATES A SHIFT FROM NEGATIVE TOWARDS POSITIVE BODY IMAGE AND WELL-BEING BY CULTIVATING POSITIVE EMBODIMENT (I.E., THE ABILITY TO FEEL A SENSE OF CONNECTION BETWEEN MIND AND BODY). IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE CONTEXT OF THE CONSTRUCTS OF DISORDERED EATING, EMBODIMENT, AND YOGA, THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS A BRIEF OVERVIEW AND CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THESE CONSTRUCTS. THE THREE MAJOR EATING DISORDERS AND CURRENT TREATMENT METHODS ARE DESCRIBED. FURTHER, THE PHILOSOPHICAL ROOTS AND THEORETICAL MODELS OF EMBODIMENT ARE DELINEATED AND THEIR COMMUNAL CORE FEATURES ARE OUTLINED. LASTLY, THE ORIGIN, BASIC PRINCIPLES, AND MODERN INTERPRETATIONS OF YOGA ARE DISCUSSED.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
3 1500  31 INTRODUCTION TO THE SPECIAL ISSUE ON YOGA AND POSITIVE EMBODIMENT: A NOTE FROM THE EDITORS ON HOW WE GOT HERE. STUDYING THE PRACTICE OF YOGA AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO BODY IMAGE, EMBODIMENT, AND EATING DISORDERS BRINGS TOGETHER THE PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL ASPECTS OF OUR LIVES AS YOGA PRACTITIONERS, RESEARCHERS, AND WOMEN LIVING IN BODIES WITHIN A SOCIETY THAT CAN BE TOUGH ON BODY APPRECIATION. DEVELOPING THIS EDITION ON "YOGA FOR POSITIVE EMBODIMENT IN EATING DISORDER PREVENTION AND TREATMENT" HAS BEEN A WORK OF LOVE FOR ALL OF US. AS YOGA PRACTITIONERS, WE HAVE PERSONALLY EXPERIENCED THE BENEFITS OF YOGA IN OUR OWN BODIES AND FELT THAT THERE MAY BE BENEFITS FOR OTHERS. AS RESEARCHERS, WE ARE DEDICATED TO THE EXPLORATION AND UTILIZATION OF EVIDENCE-BASED PRACTICES TO ENHANCE WELL-BEING, PROMOTE A POSITIVE BODY IMAGE AND SENSE OF EMBODIMENT, AND BOTH PREVENT AND TREAT EATING DISORDERS. OUR EXPERIENCES AS YOGA PRACTITIONERS, IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR CURIOSITY AS RESEARCHERS, LED US TO EXPLORE THE EXTANT EVIDENCE FOR YOGA AS A TOOL FOR LEADING TO IMPROVEMENTS IN BODY IMAGE, DISORDERED EATING BEHAVIORS, AND EATING DISORDERS, AND TO EMBARK ON OUR OWN RESEARCH IN THIS AREA TO FILL NECESSARY GAPS IN OUR KNOWLEDGE BASE. OUR LONG-TERM DEDICATION TO THE FIELDS OF BODY IMAGE AND EATING DISORDERS, IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR EMERGING INTEREST IN YOGA AS A POTENTIAL TOOL, LED US TO THE COMPILATION OF THIS EDITION ON YOGA AND POSITIVE EMBODIMENT.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
4 2302  21 THINKING THROUGH THE BODY: THE CONCEPTUALIZATION OF YOGA AS THERAPY FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH EATING DISORDERS. YOGA HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN VIEWED AS A DISCIPLINE THAT INCREASES SELF-AWARENESS THROUGH BODY BASED PRACTICES, MEDITATION, SELF-STUDY, AND THE READING OF PHILOSOPHICAL TEXTS. IN THE 21ST CENTURY THE MINDFULNESS TECHNIQUES OF YOGA HAVE BEEN ADAPTED AS AN ADJUNCT TO THE TREATMENT OF INDIVIDUALS WITH EATING DISORDERS. IN AN EFFORT TO UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPTUALIZATION OF YOGA AS THERAPY FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH EATING DISORDERS, THIS ARTICLE JUXTAPOSES HOW MINDFULNESS BASED YOGA IS REGARDED IN THREE DISCIPLINES: SOCIOLOGY, NEUROSCIENCE, AND THE "SPIRITUAL TEXTS" OF YOGA.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
5 2838  43 YOGA'S POTENTIAL FOR PROMOTING HEALTHY EATING AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEHAVIORS AMONG YOUNG ADULTS: A MIXED-METHODS STUDY. BACKGROUND: A REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE MAY HAVE BENEFITS FOR YOUNG ADULT HEALTH, HOWEVER, THERE IS LIMITED EVIDENCE AVAILABLE TO GUIDE YOGA INTERVENTIONS TARGETING WEIGHT-RELATED HEALTH. THE PRESENT STUDY EXPLORED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PARTICIPATION IN YOGA, HEALTHY EATING BEHAVIORS AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AMONG YOUNG ADULTS. METHODS: THE PRESENT MIXED-METHODS STUDY USED DATA COLLECTED AS PART OF WAVE 4 OF PROJECT EAT (EATING AND ACTIVITY IN TEENS AND YOUNG ADULTS), A POPULATION-BASED COHORT STUDY IN MINNEAPOLIS-ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA. YOUNG ADULTS (N = 1820) COMPLETED THE PROJECT EAT SURVEY AND A FOOD FREQUENCY QUESTIONNAIRE, AND A SUBSET WHO REPORTED PRACTICING YOGA ADDITIONALLY PARTICIPATED IN SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS (N = 46). ANALYSES OF SURVEY DATA WERE USED TO EXAMINE CROSS-SECTIONAL ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN THE FREQUENCY OF YOGA PRACTICE, DIETARY BEHAVIORS (SERVINGS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES (FV), SUGAR-SWEETENED BEVERAGES (SSBS) AND SNACK FOODS AND FREQUENCY OF FAST FOOD CONSUMPTION), AND MODERATE-TO-VIGOROUS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (MVPA). THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF INTERVIEW DISCUSSIONS FURTHER EXPLORED YOGA'S PERCEIVED INFLUENCE ON EATING AND ACTIVITY BEHAVIORS AMONG INTERVIEW PARTICIPANTS. RESULTS: REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH MORE SERVINGS OF FV, FEWER SERVINGS OF SSBS AND SNACK FOODS, LESS FREQUENT FAST FOOD CONSUMPTION, AND MORE HOURS OF MVPA. INTERVIEWS REVEALED THAT YOGA SUPPORTED HEALTHY EATING THROUGH MOTIVATION TO EAT HEALTHFULLY, GREATER MINDFULNESS, MANAGEMENT OF EMOTIONAL EATING, MORE HEALTHY FOOD CRAVINGS, AND THE INFLUENCE OF THE YOGA COMMUNITY. YOGA SUPPORTED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THROUGH ACTIVITY AS PART OF YOGA PRACTICE, MOTIVATION TO DO OTHER FORMS OF ACTIVITY, INCREASED CAPACITY TO BE ACTIVE, AND BY COMPLEMENTING AN ACTIVE LIFESTYLE. CONCLUSIONS: YOUNG ADULT YOGA PRACTITIONERS REPORTED HEALTHIER EATING BEHAVIORS AND HIGHER LEVELS OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THAN NON-PRACTITIONERS. YOGA SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED AS AN INTERVENTION FOR YOUNG ADULT HEALTH PROMOTION AND HEALTHY WEIGHT MANAGEMENT.	2018	

6  924  28 EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN EATING DISORDERS - A CASE REPORT. EATING DISORDERS ARE AMONG THE MOST COMMON PSYCHOSOMATIC DISEASES AND ARE OFTEN ASSOCIATED WITH NEGATIVE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES. THE USE OF YOGA AS A TREATMENT METHOD IN EATING DISORDERS IS CONTROVERSIAL DISCUSSED. THE INTERVIEWEE WAS A 38 YEAR OLD FEMALE PATIENT SUFFERING ON ANOREXIA NERVOSA AND VARIOUS PSYCHOSOMATIC-PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSES IN HER MEDICAL HISTORY. THE PATIENT REPORTED THAT YOGA RECOVERED THE SOUL CONTACT WHICH SHE LOST AND SHE HAD LEARNED TO PERCEIVE AND FEEL HERSELF AGAIN. SHE STATED THAT YOGA HELPED HER TO FIND ACCESS TO HER BODY AND ITS NEEDS AND TO COPE WITH HER TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES. SHE ALSO REPORTED THAT ATTITUDES HAVE CHANGED IN RELATION TO HER STOMACH IN THE TREATMENT OF HER ANOREXIA. THE CASE REPORT CONFIRMED THE POSITIVE EFFECT OF YOGA ON EATING DISORDERS. RESEARCH SHOULD PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE INFLUENCE OF INDIVIDUAL'S CO-MORBIDITIES, AS EATING DISORDERS USUALLY OCCUR IN ASSOCIATION WITH CO-MORBIDITIES.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
7 2739  35 YOGA PRACTICE AMONG ETHNICALLY/RACIALLY DIVERSE EMERGING ADULTS: ASSOCIATIONS WITH BODY IMAGE, MINDFUL AND DISORDERED EATING, AND MUSCLE-ENHANCING BEHAVIORS. BACKGROUND: THIS STUDY EXPLORES CROSS-SECTIONAL ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN YOGA AND BODY IMAGE, MINDFUL EATING, DISORDERED EATING, AND MUSCLE-ENHANCING BEHAVIORS AMONG A POPULATION-BASED SAMPLE OF ETHNICALLY/RACIALLY DIVERSE EMERGING ADULTS. METHOD: AN ETHNICALLY/RACIALLY DIVERSE POPULATION-BASED SAMPLE OF 1,568 EMERGING ADULTS (18-26 YEARS) COMPLETED SURVEYS AS PART OF EAT 2010-2018 (EATING AND ACTIVITY OVER TIME). MODELS WERE ADJUSTED FOR SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS AND BODY MASS INDEX (BMI). RESULTS: PRACTICING YOGA AT LEAST 30 MIN/WEEK WAS REPORTED BY 12.7% (N = 210) OF THE SAMPLE. YOGA PRACTITIONERS HAD HIGHER LEVELS OF MINDFUL EATING THAN THOSE NOT PRACTICING YOGA. ALTHOUGH EFFECT SIZES WERE SMALL, YOGA PRACTITIONERS WERE MORE LIKELY THAN NON-YOGA PRACTITIONERS TO USE STEROIDS (3.8 VS. 0.7%, P < .001, H = 0.22) OR PROTEIN POWDER/SHAKES (35.1 VS. 25.3%, P < .010, H = 0.21) TO INCREASE THEIR MUSCLE SIZE/TONE. BODY SATISFACTION, UNHEALTHY WEIGHT CONTROL BEHAVIORS, AND BINGE EATING TENDED TO BE SIMILAR AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND NON-YOGA PRACTITIONERS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION BETWEEN BMI AND YOGA IN PREDICTING BODY SATISFACTION WITH A TREND TOWARD A POSITIVE IMPACT AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS AT HIGHER BMI VALUES. INTERACTIONS BETWEEN YOGA PRACTICE AND ALL BODY IMAGE ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS ACROSS GENDER AND ETHNICITY/RACE WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. DISCUSSION: YOUNG PEOPLE FROM DIVERSE ETHNIC/RACIAL BACKGROUNDS WHO PRACTICE YOGA ARE MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN MINDFUL EATING BUT HAVE EQUAL OR ELEVATED LEVELS OF UNHEALTHY BODY IMAGE ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS AS COMPARED TO NON-YOGA PRACTITIONERS. FURTHER RESEARCH SHOULD EXPLORE HOW YOGA IS BEST TAUGHT AND PRACTICED TO ENSURE THAT IT IS BENEFICIAL FOR BODY IMAGE AND RELATED BEHAVIORS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
8  257  44 A YOGA-BASED THERAPY PROGRAM DESIGNED TO IMPROVE BODY IMAGE AMONG AN OUTPATIENT EATING DISORDERED POPULATION: PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND RESULTS FROM A MIXED-METHODS PILOT STUDY. POOR BODY IMAGE IS A CRITICAL BARRIER TO EATING DISORDER RECOVERY. THIS PILOT PROJECT WAS DESIGNED AS A FEASIBILITY STUDY TO EXAMINE A NOVEL GROUP-BASED, THERAPEUTIC YOGA AND BODY IMAGE PROGRAM (YBI) FOR ADDRESSING NEGATIVE BODY IMAGE IN THOSE CLINICALLY DIAGNOSED WITH AN EATING DISORDER (ANOREXIA, BULIMIA NERVOSA, AND OTHER SPECIFIED FEEDING OR EATING DISORDER) RECEIVING OUTPATIENT LEVEL TREATMENT AT AN EATING DISORDER TREATMENT CENTER LOCATED IN MINNEAPOLIS-ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA. SELF-ADMINISTERED QUESTIONNAIRES WERE COMPLETED BY 67 PARTICIPANTS AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE 8-WEEK SERIES, TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE ACCEPTABILITY OF THE YBI PROGRAM AND ITS POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON BODY IMAGE AND SELF-WORTH DURING OUTPATIENT EATING DISORDER TREATMENT. QUANTITATIVE SURVEY QUESTIONS ASSESSED PARTICIPANTS' BODY IMAGE CONCERNS, WHILE OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS PROBED PARTICIPANTS' EXPERIENCES AND THE PERCEIVED IMPACT OF THE YOGA PROGRAM ON THEIR BODY IMAGE. AFTER COMPLETION OF THE YOGA PROGRAM, MEAN ITEM SCORES ON THE BODY IMAGE CONCERN SURVEY IMPROVED: INCREASES RANGED FROM 0.3 TO 0.8 POINTS ON A 5-POINT SCALE. IN OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS, PARTICIPANTS DESCRIBED MANY POSITIVE CHANGES TO THEIR BODY IMAGE. PARTICIPANTS REPORTED THAT THE YOGA PROGRAM IMPROVED THEIR SELF-ACCEPTANCE, SELF-AWARENESS, CONFIDENCE, EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL STRENGTH, AND WAS A POSITIVE FORM OF RELEASE. PARTICIPANTS ALSO DISCUSSED PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL CHALLENGES OF THE YOGA PROGRAM AND HOW THEY CONTRIBUTED TO SELF-JUDGMENT, VULNERABILITY, AND CONFRONTATION OF UNCOMFORTABLE FEELINGS. THE RESULTS OF THIS PILOT STUDY ARE PROMISING AND WARRANT CONSIDERATION OF MORE RIGOROUS STUDY DESIGNS TO EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL OF A BODY IMAGE SPECIFIC THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM TO AID THOSE IN EATING DISORDER TREATMENT TO IMPROVE BODY IMAGE DISTURBANCES.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                   
9 2517  22 YOGA COMMUNITIES AND EATING DISORDERS: CREATING SAFE SPACE FOR POSITIVE EMBODIMENT. WITH ADEQUATE EDUCATION AND GUIDANCE, YOGA COMMUNITIES, AS PART OF THE THERAPEUTIC LANDSCAPE IN THE 21ST CENTURY, CAN PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE PROMOTING POSITIVE EMBODIMENT FOR THOSE WITH, AND AT-RISK FOR, EATING DISORDERS (EDS). TO DO THIS, YOGA TEACHERS NEED TO KNOW HOW TO CREATE A BODY-POSITIVE COMMUNITY AND BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE AND RESPOND TO THOSE AT RISK AND STRUGGLING WITH EDS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. IN ORDER TO ADDRESS YOGA TEACHING METHODS ASSOCIATED WITH EDS AND ED RISK, BROADER CONCEPTUAL APPROACHES AND SPECIFIC PRACTICES ASSOCIATED WITH POSITIVE EMBODIMENT ARE OFFERED. THESE INCLUDE THE BROADER CONCEPTUAL APPROACHES OF: INTENTIONAL INCLUSION AND ACCEPTANCE, EXPERIENTIAL EMPHASIS, SUPPORTING POSITIVE EMBODIMENT AND INQUIRY. STUDIO PRAGMATICS ARE ALSO DETAILED AS RELATED TO THE BODY, BREATH, EMOTIONS, AND COMMUNITY. ASSESSMENT, REFERRAL, AND COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT ARE ALSO ADDRESSED.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
10 2434  28 YOGA AND PILATES: ASSOCIATIONS WITH BODY IMAGE AND DISORDERED-EATING BEHAVIORS IN A POPULATION-BASED SAMPLE OF YOUNG ADULTS. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN PARTICIPATING IN MIND-BODY ACTIVITIES (YOGA/PILATES) AND BODY DISSATISFACTION AND DISORDERED EATING (UNHEALTHY AND EXTREME WEIGHT CONTROL PRACTICES AND BINGE EATING) IN A POPULATION-BASED SAMPLE OF YOUNG ADULTS. METHOD: THE SAMPLE INCLUDED 1,030 YOUNG MEN AND 1,257 YOUNG WOMEN (MEAN AGE: 25.3 YEARS, SD = 1.7) WHO PARTICIPATED IN PROJECT EAT-III (EATING AND ACTIVITY IN TEENS AND YOUNG ADULTS). RESULTS: AMONG WOMEN, DISORDERED EATING WAS PREVALENT IN YOGA/PILATES PARTICIPANTS AND NONPARTICIPANTS, WITH NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GROUPS. MEN PARTICIPATING IN YOGA/PILATES WERE MORE LIKELY TO USE EXTREME WEIGHT CONTROL BEHAVIORS (18.6% VS. 6.8%, P = .006) AND BINGE EATING (11.6% VS. 4.2%, P = .023), AND MARGINALLY MORE LIKELY TO USE UNHEALTHY WEIGHT CONTROL BEHAVIORS (49.1% VS. 34.5%; P = .053), THAN NONPARTICIPANTS AFTER ADJUSTING FOR SOCIODEMOGRAPHICS, WEIGHT STATUS, AND OVERALL PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. DISCUSSION: FINDINGS SUGGEST THE IMPORTANCE OF HELPING YOGA/PILATES INSTRUCTORS RECOGNIZE THAT THEIR STUDENTS MAY BE AT RISK FOR DISORDERED EATING.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
11  415  23 BODY AWARENESS, EATING ATTITUDES, AND SPIRITUAL BELIEFS OF WOMEN PRACTICING YOGA. THIS RESEARCH EVALUATED ATTITUDES ABOUT BODY IMAGE AND EATING IN WOMEN PRACTICING POSTURAL YOGA. STUDY 1 DESCRIBED SCORES FROM QUESTIONNAIRES ON VARIABLES RELATED TO BODY AWARENESS, INTUITIVE EATING, SPIRITUALITY, AND REASONS FOR PRACTICING. SCORES WERE FAVORABLE ON ALL MEASURES WITH SIGNIFICANT CORRELATIONS (P < .01) AMONG ALL MAIN VARIABLES EXCEPT BETWEEN SPIRITUAL READINESS AND INTUITIVE EATING, AND BETWEEN BMI AND BOTH BODY AWARENESS AND SPIRITUAL READINESS. REASONS FOR PRACTICING DID NOT AFFECT SCORES. STUDY 2 EVALUATED INTERVIEWS IN A SUB-SAMPLE. QUALITATIVE DATA REPORTED IMPROVEMENTS IN BODY SATISFACTION AND DISORDERED EATING DUE IN PART TO YOGA AND ITS ASSOCIATED SPIRITUALITY.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
12 2435  28 YOGA AND POSITIVE BODY IMAGE: A TEST OF THE EMBODIMENT MODEL. THE STUDY AIMED TO TEST THE EMBODIMENT MODEL OF POSITIVE BODY IMAGE (MENZEL & LEVINE, 2011) WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF YOGA. PARTICIPANTS WERE 193 YOGA PRACTITIONERS (124 IYENGAR, 69 BIKRAM) AND 127 UNIVERSITY STUDENTS (NON-YOGA PARTICIPANTS) FROM ADELAIDE, SOUTH AUSTRALIA. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED QUESTIONNAIRE MEASURES OF POSITIVE BODY IMAGE, EMBODIMENT, SELF-OBJECTIFICATION, AND DESIRE FOR THINNESS. RESULTS SHOWED YOGA PRACTITIONERS SCORED HIGHER ON POSITIVE BODY IMAGE AND EMBODIMENT, AND LOWER ON SELF-OBJECTIFICATION THAN NON-YOGA PARTICIPANTS. IN SUPPORT OF THE EMBODIMENT MODEL, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOGA PARTICIPATION AND POSITIVE BODY IMAGE WAS SERIALLY MEDIATED BY EMBODIMENT AND REDUCED SELF-OBJECTIFICATION. ALTHOUGH BIKRAM PRACTITIONERS ENDORSED APPEARANCE-RELATED REASONS FOR PARTICIPATING IN YOGA MORE THAN IYENGAR PRACTITIONERS, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN IYENGAR AND BIKRAM YOGA PRACTITIONERS ON BODY IMAGE VARIABLES. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT YOGA IS AN EMBODYING ACTIVITY THAT CAN PROVIDE WOMEN WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO CULTIVATE A FAVOURABLE RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR BODY.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
13  391  31 BENEFITS OF YOGA IN THE TREATMENT OF EATING DISORDERS: RESULTS OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. YOGA HAS BEGUN TO BE INCORPORATED INTO THE TREATMENT OF EATING DISORDERS DESPITE LIMITED EMPIRICAL SUPPORT FOR THIS PRACTICE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFICACY OF INCORPORATING YOGA INTO THE TREATMENT OF EATING DISORDERS. THIS PRELIMINARY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL INVESTIGATED THE BENEFITS OF PARTICIPATING IN AN EIGHT-WEEK KRIPALU YOGA PROGRAM FOR 53 WOMEN WITH SYMPTOMS OF BULIMIA NERVOSA AND BINGE EATING DISORDER. COMPARED TO WAITLIST CONTROLS, YOGA PARTICIPANTS EXPERIENCED DECREASES IN BINGE EATING FREQUENCY, EMOTIONAL REGULATION DIFFICULTIES AND SELF-CRITICISM, AND INCREASES IN SELF-COMPASSION. YOGA PARTICIPANTS ALSO EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN STATE MINDFULNESS SKILLS ACROSS THE EIGHT WEEKS OF THE YOGA PROGRAM. WHILE THESE RESULTS ARE ENCOURAGING AND SUGGEST YOGA MAY HAVE A VALUABLE ROLE TO PLAY IN THE TREATMENT OF EATING DISORDERS, IT IS IMPORTANT TO STRESS THEIR TENTATIVE NATURE. FURTHER RESEARCH, ADOPTING A MORE RIGOROUS DESIGN, IS NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE LIMITATIONS OF THE PRESENT STUDY AND EXPAND ON THESE FINDINGS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
14  635  48 DISORDERED EATING BEHAVIOURS AND CORRELATES IN YOGA PRACTITIONERS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. PURPOSE: YOGA HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY USED AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR EATING DISORDERS. HOWEVER, IT IS STILL NOT CLEAR WHETHER YOGA IS EFFECTIVE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF EATING DISORDERS, AS SOME STUDIES SUGGEST THAT YOGA PRACTITIONERS SHOW ELEVATED LEVELS OF DISORDERED EATING BEHAVIOURS. THE GOAL OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW IS, THUS, TO ANALYSE THE OCCURRENCE OF DISORDERED EATING BEHAVIOURS AND CORRELATES IN YOGA PRACTITIONERS. METHOD: PRISMA GUIDELINES FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS WERE USED. SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED IN SEVERAL DATABASES AND SPECIFIC JOURNALS. RESULTS: TWELVE ARTICLES, ALL CROSS-SECTIONAL, WERE IDENTIFIED, FOLLOWING PRISMA GUIDELINES. RESULTS ACROSS STUDIES WERE INCONSISTENT. YOGA PRACTICE WAS USUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH HEALTHIER EATING BEHAVIOURS, LOWER DISORDERED EATING SYMPTOMS, AND HIGHER POSITIVE BODY IMAGE AND BODY SATISFACTION, SUGGESTING THAT YOGA PRACTITIONERS MAY BE AT A LOWER RISK OF DEVELOPING EATING DISORDERS. HOWEVER, OTHER STUDIES SUGGESTED THAT A HIGH DOSAGE OF YOGA PRACTICE MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH A HIGHER PREVALENCE OF DISORDERED EATING BEHAVIOURS. CONCLUSIONS: AS YOGA IS INCREASINGLY USED AS THERAPY FOR EATING DISORDERS, UNDERSTANDING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOGA DOSAGE AND DISORDERED EATING BEHAVIOURS IS CRITICAL TO GUIDE TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS AND ESTABLISH YOGA AS A VALUABLE COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY.

16 1878  29 REALIZING YOGA'S ALL-ACCESS PASS: A SOCIAL JUSTICE CRITIQUE OF WESTERNIZED YOGA AND INCLUSIVE EMBODIMENT. IN THE 21(ST) CENTURY, THE ANCIENT MIND-BODY PRACTICE OF YOGA HAS SURGED IN POPULARITY AMONG WESTERN ENTHUSIASTS FOR ITS NUMEROUS HEALTH BENEFITS. PARTICULARLY, A GROWING EVIDENCE BASE SUPPORTS YOGA FOR CULTIVATING POSITIVE EMBODIMENT AND REDUCING RISK FOR DISORDERED EATING. NEVERTHELESS, AMIDST ITS RISE ARE CONCERNS ABOUT YOGA'S DEPARTURE FROM ITS SPIRITUAL FOUNDATIONS AND INCREASING ASSIMILATION INTO THE APPEARANCE- AND COMMERCIAL-DRIVEN EXERCISE AND FITNESS CULTURE. CONSEQUENTLY, AN EXCLUSIONARY IDENTITY HAS BEEN PERPETUATED IN SHAPING NORMS SURROUNDING WHO CAN AND DOES PRACTICE YOGA, WHICH CONTRADICTS EARLIER EGALITARIAN VISIONS OF A YOGA FOR ALL. THEREFORE, WE ADOPT A SOCIAL JUSTICE LENS IN OFFERING A FOCUSED ANALYSIS OF THE INTERSECTION OF YOGA, EMBODIMENT, AND INCLUSION FOR SELECT MARGINALIZED SOCIAL IDENTITIES TYPICALLY UNDERREPRESENTED AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND IN YOGA SCHOLARSHIP. DATA ARE SYNTHESIZED FROM BOTH QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE SOURCES AND INTEGRATE AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW CONFINED MEDIA REPRESENTATIONS OF "THE YOGA BODY" AND OTHER PRACTICAL CONSTRAINTS MAY UNDERMINE THE PERCEIVED ACCESS TO THE PRACTICE FOR MEMBERS OF DIVERSE GROUPS. WE CONCLUDE WITH INVITING FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS TOWARDS FOSTERING MORE INTERDISCIPLINARY COMMUNITY-BASED RESEARCH PARTNERSHIPS AMONG THE VARIETY OF STAKEHOLDERS INVESTED IN ADVANCING THE ACCESSIBILITY AND INCLUSION OF YOGA AND POSITIVE EMBODIMENT FOR ALL BODIES.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
17 2448  24 YOGA AND THE EXPERIENCE OF EMBODIMENT: A DISCUSSION OF POSSIBLE LINKS. THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON BODY IMAGE AND EMBODIMENT HAS BEEN A RECENT AREA OF FOCUS IN THE FIELD OF BODY IMAGE AND EATING DISORDERS. THIS PAPER COMPRISES A THEORETICAL DISCUSSION OF HOW THE PRACTICE OF YOGA CAN LEAD TO POSITIVE WAYS OF INHABITING THE BODY, SPECIFICALLY THROUGH THE LENS OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL THEORY OF EMBODIMENT. YOGA MAY ENHANCE THE OVERALL EXPERIENCE OF EMBODIMENT, BY HAVING A POSITIVE IMPACT ON EACH OF ITS FIVE DIMENSIONS: BODY CONNECTION AND COMFORT, AGENCY AND FUNCTIONALITY, ATTUNED SELF-CARE, SUBJECTIVE IMMERSION (RESISTING OBJECTIFICATION), AND EXPERIENCE AND EXPRESSION OF DESIRES. THE ARTICLE THEREFORE DESCRIBES EXAMPLES OF TEACHER-RELATED PRACTICES DURING YOGA THAT CAN ENHANCE EACH OF THESE DIMENSIONS. FURTHER, YOGA TEACHERS CAN CONSIDER THE VARIED PROTECTIVE PHYSICAL AND SOCIAL FACTORS DELINEATED BY THE DEVELOPMENTAL THEORY OF EMBODIMENT TO FACILITATE POSITIVE EMBODIMENT. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD EXPLICITLY INTEGRATE EMBODIMENT THEORY WITH YOGA INTERVENTIONS, AS WELL AS MEASURES THAT ASSESS BOTH POSSIBLE MECHANISMS OF CHANGE AND POSITIVE WAYS OF LIVING IN THE BODY.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
18 1492  36 INTERNALIZED WEIGHT STIGMA AND INTUITIVE EATING AMONG STRESSED ADULTS DURING A MINDFUL YOGA INTERVENTION: ASSOCIATIONS WITH CHANGES IN MINDFULNESS AND SELF-COMPASSION. PURPOSE: INTERNALIZED WEIGHT STIGMA (IWS) IS COMMON IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ACROSS BODY WEIGHT CATEGORIES, AND IS IMPLICATED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF DISTRESS AND UNHEALTHY EATING BEHAVIORS (E.G. OVEREATING, DISORDERED EATING) THAT CAN FOSTER POOR CARDIOMETABOLIC HEALTH. WHILE EMERGING INTERVENTION RESEARCH SHOWS EARLY PROMISE IN REDUCING IWS, LONG-TERM EFFICACY IS UNCLEAR AND NOVEL STRATEGIES REMAIN NEEDED. THIS ANALYSIS EXAMINED WHETHER PARTICIPATION IN A MINDFUL YOGA INTERVENTION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED IWS AND INCREASED INTUITIVE EATING, AN ADAPTIVE EATING BEHAVIOR, AND WHETHER THESE CHANGES CORRELATED WITH EACH OTHER OR WITH CHANGES IN MINDFULNESS AND SELF-COMPASSION. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE STRESSED ADULTS WITH LOW FRUIT AND VEGETABLE INTAKE (N = 78, 64.1% WHITE, M. BODY MASS INDEX 25.59 +/- 4.45) ENROLLED IN A PARENT CLINICAL TRIAL OF A 12-WEEK MINDFUL YOGA INTERVENTION. VALIDATED SELF-REPORT MEASURES OF IWS, INTUITIVE EATING, MINDFULNESS, AND SELF-COMPASSION WERE ADMINISTERED AT PRE-TREATMENT, MID-TREATMENT (8 WEEKS), POST-TREATMENT (12 WEEKS), AND 4-MONTH FOLLOW-UP (24 WEEKS). RESULTS: LINEAR MIXED MODELING REVEALED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN IWS AND INTUITIVE EATING ACROSS THE FOUR TIMEPOINTS (P < .001). REDUCED IWS CORRELATED WITH INCREASED INTUITIVE EATING PRE- TO POST-TREATMENT (P = .01). IMPROVED SELF-COMPASSION AND MINDFULNESS CORRELATED WITH INTUITIVE EATING (BOTH P = . 04), BUT NOT IWS (P = .74 AND P = .56, RESPECTIVELY). CONCLUSION: THIS STUDY OFFERS PRELIMINARY SUPPORT FOR THE HYPOTHESIS THAT MINDFUL YOGA MAY PROMOTE INTUITIVE EATING AND REDUCE IWS AMONG STRESSED ADULTS WITH POOR DIET, AND SUGGESTS THAT CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS MAY CO-OCCUR OVER TIME. FURTHER INVESTIGATION WITH CONTROLLED DESIGNS IS NECESSARY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE TEMPORALITY AND CAUSALITY OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS.TRIAL REGISTRATION: CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT02098018.	2021	
                                                                                 
19  999  35 EFFECTS OF INTUITIVE EATING ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND WELLBEING OF YOGA PRACTITIONERS, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PRACTITIONERS AND SEDENTARY INDIVIDUALS. THIS STUDY IS A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF INTUITIVE EATING AND CORRELATIONS WITH QUALITY OF LIFE AND WELLBEING IN YOGA PRACTITIONERS, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PRACTITIONERS AND SEDENTARY INDIVIDUALS. THE STUDY INVOLVED 204 PARTICIPANTS, COMPRISING 66 YOGA PRACTITIONERS, 74 PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PRACTITIONERS AND 64 SEDENTARY INDIVIDUALS, BETWEEN THE AGES OF 20 AND 59, WHO WERE RESIDENT IN BRAZIL AT THE TIME OF THE STUDY. QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED THROUGH FACEBOOK AND THE APPLICATION QUESTIONNAIRES VIA GOOGLE FORMS TO MEASURE INTUITIVE EATING, FOOD CONSUMPTION, QUALITY OF LIFE, STRESS LEVEL, SATISFACTION WITH BODY IMAGE AND LEVEL OF MINDFULNESS. THE STUDY FOUND THAT WHILE INTUITIVE EATING DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PRACTITIONERS, BOTH SHOWED GREATER ADOPTION OF INTUITIVE EATING AS COMPARED TO INACTIVE INDIVIDUALS. STILL, YOGA PRACTITIONERS HAD BETTER CONFIDENCE IN THEIR PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNS OF HUNGER AND SATIETY, AS WELL AS BETTER EATING BEHAVIOR, QUALITY OF LIFE, SATISFACTION WITH BODY IMAGE, HEALTHY BODY WEIGHT, AND STRESS-RELATED EMOTIONAL REGULATION, AS COMPARED TO THE OTHER GROUPS. IN ADDITION, THERE WAS A POSITIVE CORRELATION BETWEEN INTUITIVE EATING AND QUALITY OF LIFE, BODY ESTEEM, MINDFULNESS AND EATING BEHAVIORS THAT DISCOURAGED EATING IN RESPONSE TO EXTERNAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL INFLUENCES, AND A NEGATIVE CORRELATION TO STRESS AND WEIGHT GAIN. THIS STUDY FINDS THAT PHYSICAL EXERCISE, IN PARTICULAR THE PRACTICE OF YOGA, IS LINKED TO THE PROMOTION OF BETTER INTUITIVE EATING BEHAVIOR AS WELL AS BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE AND WELLBEING.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
20   15  30 "OVEREATING IS NOT ABOUT THE FOOD": WOMEN DESCRIBE THEIR EXPERIENCE OF A YOGA TREATMENT PROGRAM FOR BINGE EATING. AS PART OF A LARGER MIXED-METHODS STUDY, DATA FROM 20 PERSONAL JOURNALS WERE ANALYZED TO EXAMINE THE EXPERIENCE OF A 12-WEEK YOGA TREATMENT PROGRAM FOR BINGE EATING AMONG A SAMPLE OF 25 WOMEN WHO WERE OBESE. QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS REVEALED A POSITIVE SHIFT EXPERIENCED BY THE WOMEN DURING THE PROGRAM, SUMMARIZED BY A GENERAL STRUCTURAL DESCRIPTION: DISCONNECTION VERSUS CONNECTION. WOMEN'S COMMENTS SUGGESTED THAT THE PROGRAM APPEARED TO ENCOURAGE A HEALTHY RECONNECTION TO FOOD, AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF PHYSICAL SELF-EMPOWERMENT, THROUGH CULTIVATING PRESENT-MOMENT AWARENESS. SPECIFICALLY, WOMEN PERCEIVED AN OVERALL REDUCTION IN THE QUANTITY OF FOOD THEY CONSUMED, DECREASED EATING SPEED, AND AN IMPROVEMENT IN FOOD CHOICES THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAM. THE WOMEN ALSO REPORTED FEELING MORE CONNECTED TO AND POSITIVE ABOUT THEIR PHYSICAL WELL-BEING. THESE EVOLVING OUTCOMES WERE SUMMARIZED THROUGH TWO MAJOR THEMES: THE WAY THEIR PHYSICALITY CHANGED, AND THE WAY THEIR FOOD CONSUMPTION CHANGED OVER TIME. FINDINGS PROVIDE INSIGHTS RELEVANT TO THERAPEUTIC PROCESSES THAT MIGHT OCCUR WITHIN EATING DISORDER INTERVENTIONS THAT DRAW ON MEDITATION-BASED APPROACHES.	2009

1 1374 159 IMPACT OF AN INTEGRATED YOGA THERAPY PROTOCOL ON INSULIN RESISTANCE AND GLYCEMIC CONTROL IN PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS. OBJECTIVE: DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), CHARACTERIZED BY CHRONIC HYPERGLYCEMIA, IS ATTRIBUTED TO RELATIVE INSULIN DEFICIENCY OR RESISTANCE, OR BOTH. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT YOGA CAN MODULATE PARAMETERS OF INSULIN RESISTANCE. THE PRESENT STUDY EXPLORED THE POSSIBLE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF INTEGRATED YOGA THERAPY WITH REFERENCE TO GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND INSULIN RESISTANCE (IR) IN INDIVIDUALS WITH DIABETES MAINTAINED ON STANDARD ORAL MEDICAL CARE WITH YOGA THERAPY, COMPARED TO THOSE ON STANDARD ORAL MEDICAL CARE ALONE. METHODS: IN THIS STUDY, THE SUBJECTS ON YOGA INTERVENTION COMPRISED 35 TYPE 2 DIABETICS, AND AN EQUAL NUMBER OF VOLUNTEERS CONSTITUTED THE CONTROL GROUP. SUBJECTS RANGED IN AGE FROM 30 TO 70 YEARS, WITH HEMOGLOBIN A1C (HBA1C) TEST MORE THAN 7%, AND WERE MAINTAINED ON DIABETIC DIET AND ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC AGENTS. BLOOD SAMPLES WERE DRAWN PRIOR TO AND AFTER 120 DAYS OF INTEGRATED YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION. FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE (FBG), POST-PRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE (PPBG), HBA1C, INSULIN, AND LIPID PROFILE WERE ASSESSED IN BOTH THE INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS. RESULTS: THE INTERVENTION GROUP REVEALED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) (0.7 KG/M(2) MEDIAN DECREASE; P=0.001), FBG (20 MG/DL MEDIAN DECREASE; P<0.001), PPBG (33 MG/DL MEDIAN DECREASE; P<0.001), HBA1C (0.4% MEDIAN DECREASE; P<0.001), HOMEOSTATIC MODEL ASSESSMENT FOR INSULIN RESISTANCE (HOMA-IR) (1.2 MEDIAN DECREASE; P<0.001), CHOLESTEROL (13 MG/DL MEDIAN DECREASE, P=0.006), TRIACYLGLYCEROL (22 MG/DL MEDIAN DECREASE; P=0.027), LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (6 MG/DL MEDIAN DECREASE; P=0.004), AND VERY-LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN LEVELS (4 MG/DL MEDIAN DECREASE; P=0.032). INCREASES IN HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN AFTER 120 DAYS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT (6 MG/DL MEDIAN INCREASE; P=0.15). HOWEVER, WHEN COMPARED TO CHANGES OBSERVED IN PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP, ALL THESE IMPROVEMENTS PROVED TO BE SIGNIFICANT. CONCLUSION: ADMINISTRATION OF INTEGRATED YOGA THERAPY TO INDIVIDUALS WITH DIABETES LEADS TO A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN GLYCEMIC CONTROL, INSULIN RESISTANCE, AND KEY BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
2 2245  43 THE INFLUENCE OF YOGA-BASED PROGRAMS ON RISK PROFILES IN ADULTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE THAT YOGA MAY OFFER A SAFE AND COST-EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM 2). HOWEVER, SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS ARE LACKING. THIS ARTICLE CRITICALLY REVIEWS THE PUBLISHED LITERATURE REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA-BASED PROGRAMS ON PHYSIOLOGIC AND ANTHROPOMETRIC RISK PROFILES AND RELATED CLINICAL OUTCOMES IN ADULTS WITH DM 2. WE PERFORMED A COMPREHENSIVE LITERATURE SEARCH USING FOUR COMPUTERIZED ENGLISH AND INDIAN SCIENTIFIC DATABASES. THE SEARCH WAS RESTRICTED TO ORIGINAL STUDIES (1970-2006) THAT EVALUATED THE METABOLIC AND CLINICAL EFFECTS OF YOGA IN ADULTS WITH DM 2. STUDIES TARGETING CLINICAL POPULATIONS WITH CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS THAT INCLUDED ADULTS WITH COMORBID DM WERE ALSO EVALUATED. DATA WERE EXTRACTED REGARDING STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, TARGET POPULATION, INTERVENTION, COMPARISON GROUP OR CONDITION, OUTCOME ASSESSMENT, DATA ANALYSIS AND PRESENTATION, FOLLOW-UP, AND KEY RESULTS, AND THE QUALITY OF EACH STUDY WAS EVALUATED ACCORDING TO SPECIFIC PREDETERMINED CRITERIA. WE IDENTIFIED 25 ELIGIBLE STUDIES, INCLUDING 15 UNCONTROLLED TRIALS, 6 NON-RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS AND 4 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS). OVERALL, THESE STUDIES SUGGEST BENEFICIAL CHANGES IN SEVERAL RISK INDICES, INCLUDING GLUCOSE TOLERANCE AND INSULIN SENSITIVITY, LIPID PROFILES, ANTHROPOMETRIC CHARACTERISTICS, BLOOD PRESSURE, OXIDATIVE STRESS, COAGULATION PROFILES, SYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION AND PULMONARY FUNCTION, AS WELL AS IMPROVEMENT IN SPECIFIC CLINICAL OUTCOMES. YOGA MAY IMPROVE RISK PROFILES IN ADULTS WITH DM 2, AND MAY HAVE PROMISE FOR THE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF CARDIOVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS IN THIS POPULATION. HOWEVER, THE LIMITATIONS CHARACTERIZING MOST STUDIES PRECLUDE DRAWING FIRM CONCLUSIONS. ADDITIONAL HIGH-QUALITY RCTS ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM AND FURTHER ELUCIDATE THE EFFECTS OF STANDARDIZED YOGA PROGRAMS IN POPULATIONS WITH DM 2.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
3 1933  44 ROLE OF YOGA IN MODIFYING CERTAIN CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTIONS IN TYPE 2 DIABETIC PATIENTS. OBJECTIVES: 1. TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF FORTY DAYS OF YOGIC EXERCISES ON CARDIAC FUNCTIONS IN TYPE 2 DIABETICS. 2. TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF FORTY DAYS OF YOGIC EXERCISES ON BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL, GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN. METHODS: THE PRESENT STUDY DONE IN TWENTY-FOUR TYPE 2 DM CASES PROVIDES METABOLIC AND CLINICAL EVIDENCE OF IMPROVEMENT IN GLYCAEMIC CONTROL AND AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS. THESE MIDDLE-AGED SUBJECTS WERE TYPE II DIABETICS ON ANTIHYPERGLYCAEMIC AND DIETARY REGIMEN. THEIR BASELINE FASTING AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE AND GLYCOSYLATED HB WERE MONITORED ALONG WITH AUTONOMIC FUNCTION STUDIES. THE EXPERT GAVE THESE PATIENTS TRAINING IN YOGA ASANAS AND THEY PURSUED THOSE 30-40 MIN/DAY FOR 40 DAYS UNDER GUIDANCE. THESE ASANAS CONSISTED OF 13 WELL KNOWN POSTURES, DONE IN A SEQUENCE. AFTER 40 DAYS OF YOGA ASANAS REGIMEN, THE PARAMETERS WERE REPEATED. RESULTS: THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS FROM BASAL 190.08 +/- 18.54 IN MG/DL TO 141.5 +/- 16.3 IN MG/DL AFTER YOGA REGIMEN. THE POST PRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS DECREASED FROM 276.54 +/- 20.62 IN MG/DL TO 201.75 +/- 21.24 IN MG/DL, GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN SHOWED A DECREASE FROM 9.03 +/- 0.29% TO 7.83 +/- 0.53% AFTER YOGA REGIMEN. THE PULSE RATE, SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (FROM 86.45 +/- 2.0 TO 77.65 +/- 2.5 PULSE/MIN, FROM 142.0 +/- 3.9 TO 126.0 +/- 3.2 MM OF HG AND FROM 86.7 +/- 2.5 MM OF HG TO 75.5 +/- 2.1 MM OF HG AFTER YOGA REGIMEN RESPECTIVELY). CORRECTED QT INTERVAL (QTC) DECREASED FROM 0.42 +/- 0.0 TO 0.40 +/- 0.0. CONCLUSION: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT BETTER GLYCAEMIC CONTROL AND STABLE AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS CAN BE OBTAINED IN TYPE 2 DM CASES WITH YOGA ASANAS AND PRANAYAMA. THE EXACT MECHANISM AS TO HOW THESE POSTURES AND CONTROLLED BREATHING INTERACT WITH SOMATO-NEURO-ENDOCRINE MECHANISM AFFECTING METABOLIC AND AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS REMAINS TO BE WORKED OUT.	2004	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
4  691  56 EFFECT OF COMMUNITY-BASED STRUCTURED YOGA PROGRAM ON HBA1C LEVEL AMONG TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS PATIENTS: AN INTERVENTIONAL STUDY. CONTEXT: IN VIEW OF THE RISING BURDEN OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM) CASES IN INDIA, THERE IS AN URGENT NEED FOR AN EFFECTIVE, LOW-COST, SUSTAINABLE INTERVENTION CONTROLLING DIABETES THUS PREVENTING COMPLICATIONS. AIMS: THIS STUDY AIMED TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF STRUCTURED YOGA PROGRAMS ON DIABETES. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: THIS WAS A COMMUNITY-BASED INTERVENTIONAL STUDY THAT WAS CONDUCTED IN AN URBAN RESETTLEMENT COLONY OF DELHI, INDIA. KNOWN DIABETES PATIENTS WITH GLYCATED HEMOGLOBIN (HB1AC) >/=6.5% WERE ENROLLED FROM 12 RANDOMLY SELECTED BLOCKS OF THE COMMUNITY WITH A SAMPLE SIZE OF 192 IN EACH INTERVENTION AND WAIT-LISTED CONTROL ARM. THE INTERVENTION WAS STRUCTURED YOGA OF 50 MIN DAILY, 2 CONSECUTIVE WEEKS IN A NEARBY PARK AND HEALTH CENTER FOLLOWED BY TWICE A WEEK HOME PRACTICE UP TO THE 3(RD) MONTH. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS HBA1C% AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES WERE LIPID PROFILE AND FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: APER-PROTOCOL ANALYSIS WAS DONE. MEAN, STANDARD DEVIATION (SD), AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL WERE ESTIMATED. THE LEVEL OF SIGNIFICANCE WAS CONSIDERED FOR 0.05. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE OF HB1AC (0.5%, SD = 1.5, P = 0.02), TOTAL CHOLESTEROL (11.7 MG/DL, SD = 40.5, P < 0.01), AND LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (3.2 MG/DL, SD = 37.4, P < 0.01) FROM BASELINE TO END LINE IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP. THESE CHANGES IN INTERVENTION GROUP WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE CHANGE IN THE WAIT-LISTED CONTROL GROUP. THE OTHER VARIABLES DID NOT CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY. CONCLUSIONS: IT REVEALED THAT STRUCTURED YOGA PROGRAM IMPROVED GLYCEMIC OUTCOME AND LIPID PROFILE OF INDIVIDUALS IN A COMMUNITY-BASED SETTING. YOGA CAN BE A FEASIBLE STRATEGY TO CONTROL HYPERGLYCEMIA, LIPID LEVELS, AND CAN HELP BETTER CONTROL TYPE 2 DM.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
5  921  34 EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AS THE PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION MODULE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES AND DIABETES ASSOCIATED DEMENTIA IN SOUTH EAST ASIA: A NARRATIVE REVIEW. BACKGROUND: DIABETES MELLITUS (DM) IS WIDELY SPREAD IN SOUTH ASIAN (ASEAN) AND INDIAN SUB-CONTINENT. THE INCREASING HEALTHCARE COSTS OF DM CAN BE PREVENTED IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD BY IMPROVED PUBLIC HEALTHCARE INTERVENTIONS. MODIFIABLE RISK FACTORS OF DM LIKE SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE, OBESITY, AND STRESSFUL CONDITIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ITS PROGRESSION; HOWEVER, THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA COLLECTED BY PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS ARE LIMITED. SUMMARY: A REVIEW OF PUBLISHED LITERATURE DESCRIBING GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF DM AND ASSOCIATED DEMENTIA IN SOUTH ASIAN REGION, PARTICULARLY INDIA, WAS CONDUCTED WITH THE PURPOSE OF ASSESSING THE FEASIBILITY AND CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE YOGA-BASED RISK REDUCTION. PUBMED AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR DM AND DEMENTIA-RELATED ARTICLES BY USING A COMBINATION OF KEYWORDS: DIABETES, DIABETES RELATED DEMENTIA SOUTHEAST ASIA, PRE-DIABETES, YOGA, LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION, DEMENTIA AND EXERCISE. THE EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA GENERATED FROM THESE DISEASES HAVE NOT PROMPTED TO ANY MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH POLICIES. YOGA CAN BE A COST-EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR THE PREVENTION OF TYPE 2 DM (T2DM) AND ITS ASSOCIATED COGNITIVE DECLINE WHEN DETECTED EARLY. IF NATIONWIDE INTERVENTION OF YOGA IS BROUGHT ABOUT BY THE STATE, ITS INTEGRATION IN HEALTH CARE WILL BECOME MORE MEANINGFUL AND ACCEPTABLE. KEY MESSAGE: STUDIES SUGGEST THAT YOGA AND CHANGE IN LIFESTYLE CAN MODIFY THE HEALTH RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH T2DM AND ASSOCIATED DEMENTIA IF IT IS MAINSTREAMED WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH INITIATIVE OF AYUSHMAN BHARAT SCHEME.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
6 1116  41 EFFICACY OF A VALIDATED YOGA PROTOCOL ON DYSLIPIDEMIA IN DIABETES PATIENTS: NMB-2017 INDIA TRIAL. BACKGROUND: DYSLIPIDEMIA IS CONSIDERED A RISK FACTOR IN TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM) RESULTING IN CARDIO-VASCULAR COMPLICATIONS. YOGA PRACTICES HAVE SHOWN PROMISING RESULTS IN ALLEVIATING TYPE 2 DIABETES PATHOLOGY. METHOD: IN THIS STRATIFIED TRIAL ON A YOGA BASED LIFESTYLE PROGRAM IN CASES WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES, IN THE RURAL AND URBAN POPULATION FROM ALL ZONES OF INDIA, A TOTAL OF 17,012 ADULTS (>20 YEARS) OF BOTH GENDERS WERE SCREENED FOR LIPID PROFILE AND SUGAR LEVELS. THOSE WHO SATISFIED THE SELECTION CRITERIA WERE TAUGHT THE DIABETES YOGA PROTOCOL (DYP) FOR THREE MONTHS AND THE DATA WERE ANALYZED. RESULTS: AMONG THOSE WITH DIABETES, 29.1% HAD ELEVATED TOTAL CHOLESTEROL (TC > 200 MG/DL) LEVELS THAT WERE HIGHER IN URBAN (69%) THAN RURAL (31%) DIABETES PATIENTS. THERE WAS A POSITIVE CORRELATION (P = 0.048) BETWEEN HBA1C AND TOTAL CHOLESTEROL LEVELS. DYP INTERVENTION HELPED IN REDUCING TC FROM 232.34 +/- 31.48 MG/DL TO 189.38 +/- 40.23 MG/DL WITH SIGNIFICANT PRE POST DIFFERENCE (P < 0.001). CONVERSION RATE FROM HIGH TC (>200 MG/DL) TO NORMAL TC (<200 MG/DL) WAS OBSERVED IN 60.3% OF CASES WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM); FROM HIGH LDL (>130 MG/DL) TO NORMAL LDL (<130 MG/DL) IN 73.7%; FROM HIGH TRIGLYCERIDE (>200 MG/DL) TO NORMAL TRIGLYCERIDE LEVEL (<200 MG/DL) IN 63%; FROM LOW HDL (<45 MG/DL) TO NORMAL HDL (>45 MG/DL) IN 43.7% OF T2DM PATIENTS AFTER THREE MONTHS OF DYP. CONCLUSIONS: A YOGA LIFESTYLE PROGRAM DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY TO MANAGE DIABETES HELPS IN REDUCING THE CO-MORBIDITY OF DYSLIPIDEMIA IN CASES OF PATIENTS WITH T2DM.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
7 2283  44 THE USE OF INTEGRATIVE THERAPY BASED ON YOGA AND AYURVEDA IN THE TREATMENT OF A HIGH-RISK CASE OF COVID-19/SARS-COV-2 WITH MULTIPLE COMORBIDITIES: A CASE REPORT. BACKGROUND: WE REPORT A HIGH-RISK CASE OF A CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 19 (COVID-19)-POSITIVE PATIENT WITH COMORBIDITIES INCLUDING DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), HYPERTENSION (HTN), HYPOTHYROIDISM AND CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (CKD), TREATED SUCCESSFULLY USING AN INTEGRATIVE THERAPY PLAN BASED ON AYURVEDA AND YOGA, ALONG WITH GOVERNMENT-MANDATED COMPULSORY MODERN WESTERN MEDICINE (MWM) TREATMENT. RECENTLY, SOME EVIDENCE HAS BEEN EMERGING ON THE USE OF AYURVEDA FOR TREATMENT OF COVID-19. THE CLASSICAL TEXTS OF AYURVEDIC MEDICINE SUCH AS CHARAKA SAMHITA AND SUSHRUTA SAMHITA CONTAIN DESCRIPTIONS OF PANDEMICS OF SIMILAR PROPORTIONS AND DESCRIBE THEM AS JANAPADODDHVANSA, MEANING THE DESTRUCTION OF COMMUNITIES, ALONG WITH THEIR CAUSES AND TREATMENT. CASE PRESENTATION: THE CASE REPORTED HEREIN IS A 55-YEAR-OLD MAN FROM DELHI, INDIA, WITH CONFIRMED (TESTED) COVID-19, WHO FIRST TOOK MWM FOR 7 DAYS BEFORE SEEKING INTEGRATIVE THERAPY. THE PATIENT HAS COMORBIDITIES INCLUDING DM, HTN, HYPOTHYROIDISM AND CKD AND HAD DEVELOPED SYMPTOMS INCLUDING FEVER (WHICH WAS RESOLVED BY THE TIME INTEGRATIVE THERAPY WAS STARTED), SORE THROAT, DRY COUGH, BODY ACHES, WEAKNESS, BAD TASTE AND SMELL, AND HEAVINESS IN THE ABDOMEN. BASED ON THE PATIENT'S SYMPTOMS AND COMORBIDITIES, A TREATMENT PLAN INCLUDING AYURVEDIC MEDICINES, YOGA PROTOCOL, DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS AND LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS WAS PRESCRIBED BY A REGISTERED AYURVEDA DOCTOR AND A YOGA CONSULTANT. THE PATIENT STARTED EXPERIENCING IMPROVEMENT IN ALL THE SYMPTOMS WITHIN 2 DAYS AFTER STARTING THE TREATMENT; HE REPORTED APPROXIMATELY [FORMULA: SEE TEXT] RELIEF FROM THE SYMPTOMS AFTER 5 DAYS, AND ALMOST COMPLETE RELIEF WITHIN 9 DAYS. ALSO, THE BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS (BOTH FASTING BLOOD SUGAR [FBS] AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD SUGAR [PPBS]) EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT AFTER 5 DAYS, AND DECREASED TO WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE WITHIN 12 DAYS. BESIDES RELIEF IN SYMPTOMS, THE PATIENT'S REAL-TIME REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (RT-PCR) TEST DONE ON THE 19TH DAY RETURNED NEGATIVE RESULTS. CONCLUSIONS: INTEGRATIVE THERAPY WAS FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE IN MITIGATING THE SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19 IN THIS PATIENT WITH MULTIPLE COMORBIDITIES. MOREOVER, A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS (NOT UNDER CONTROL WITH MODERN MEDICINE) WAS ALSO ACHIEVED. INTEGRATIVE THERAPY BASED ON THE CLASSICAL TEXTS OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA MAY OFFER A PROMISING AND SCALABLE TREATMENT OPTION FOR COVID-19 PATIENTS. A CASE SERIES OR A SUITABLY DESIGNED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IS NEEDED TO ASSESS ITS EFFICACY.	2021	

8 1453  45 INFLUENCE OF PRANAYAMAS AND YOGA-ASANAS ON SERUM INSULIN, BLOOD GLUCOSE AND LIPID PROFILE IN TYPE 2 DIABETES. A DISTINGUISHABLE FEATURE OF TYPE 2 DIABETES BESIDES HYPERGLYCEMIA AND DERANGED LIPID PROFILE IS AN IMPAIRED INSULIN SECRETION, PERIPHERAL INSULIN RESISTANCE AND OBESITY WHICH HAS BECOME A MAJOR HEALTH CONCERN WORLDWIDE. INDIA WITH AN ESTIMATED 31MILLION DIABETICS IN 2000 AND 79MLLIONS BY THE YR 2030 HAS THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF TYPE 2 DIABETICS IN THE WORLD. IN THIS STUDY, WE AIMED TO SEE IF YOGA-ASANAS AND PRANAYAMAS HAVE ANY INFLUENCE IN MODIFYING CERTAIN BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS. SIXTY PATIENTS OF UNCOMPLICATED TYPE 2 DIABETES (AGE 35-60 YRS OF 1-10 YRS DURATION) WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: GROUP 1 (N=30): PERFORMED YOGA ALONG WITH THE CONVENTIONAL HYPOGLYCEMIC MEDICINES AND GROUP 2 (N=30): PATIENTS WHO ONLY RECEIVED CONVENTIONAL MEDICINES. DURATION OF THE STUDY WAS 45 DAYS. BASAL RECORDINGS OF BLOOD GLUCOSE (FASTING AND POST-PRANDIAL), LIPID PROFILE AND SERUM INSULIN WERE TAKEN AT THE TIME OF RECRUITMENT AND THE SECOND READING AFTER FORTY FIVE DAYS. RESULTS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ALL THE BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS IN GROUP 1 WHILE GROUP 2 SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ONLY FEW PARAMETERS, THUS SUGGESTING A BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF YOGA REGIMEN ON THESE PARAMETERS IN DIABETIC PATIENTS.	2008

10 1991  23 SPINE FUSIONS, YOGA INSTRUCTORS, AND HIP FRACTURES: THE ROLE OF DUAL MOBILITY IN PRIMARY TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY. BACKGROUND: DESPITE THE INCREASED USE OF DUAL MOBILITY (DM) IN PRIMARY TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY (THA), DEBATE EXISTS REGARDING THE INDICATIONS FOR ITS USE. NO SPECIFIC ALGORITHM EXISTS TO GUIDE THIS DECISION-MAKING PROCESS. THEREFORE, THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO SUMMARIZE THE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE LITERATURE REGARDING THE USE OF DM IN PRIMARY THA AND PROVIDE EVIDENCE-BASED GUIDELINES BASED ON SPECIFIC PATIENT POPULATIONS AND RISK FACTORS FOR INSTABILITY. METHODS: WE REVIEWED THE CURRENT LITERATURE FOR STUDIES EVALUATING RISK FACTORS FOR DISLOCATION IN PRIMARY THA, AS WELL AS THE CLINICAL USE AND RESULTS OF DM IN PRIMARY THA. BASED ON THE STRENGTH OF THE LITERATURE, WE DISCUSS THE USE OF DM IN SPECIFIC PATIENT POPULATIONS. WE PROVIDE A DECISION-MAKING ALGORITHM TO DETERMINE WHETHER A PATIENT MAY BE INDICATED FOR DM IN PRIMARY THA. RESULTS: SURGEONS SHOULD CONSIDER PREOPERATIVE PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS, RISK FACTORS FOR INSTABILITY (EG, SIGNIFICANT HIP-SPINE ISSUES), TYPE OF PROCEDURE TO BE PERFORMED (EG, CONVERSION ARTHROPLASTY), AND INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY (EG, THA FOR FEMORAL NECK FRACTURE). BASED ON THIS ALGORITHMIC ASSESSMENT, DM MAY BE WARRANTED IN THE PRIMARY THA SETTING IF A PATIENT'S COMBINED RISK REACHES AN ESTABLISHED THRESHOLD BASED ON THE LITERATURE. CONCLUSION: THIS EVIDENCE-BASED ALGORITHM MAY HELP GUIDE CURRENT PRACTICE IN THE USE OF DM IN PRIMARY THA. WE ADVOCATE THE CONTINUED JUDICIOUS USE OF DM IN HIP ARTHROPLASTY. LONGER TERM STUDIES ARE NEEDED IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE DURABILITY OF DM, AS WELL AS ANY COMPLICATIONS RELATED TO THE DM ARTICULATION.	2021

RESULTS: THE INTERVENTION GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE, 2-H POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE, AND GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN (HBA1C) IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: MINDFULNESS EATING AND YOGA EXERCISE HAD HEALTH BENEFITS ON GLYCEMIC CONTROL IN PREGNANT WOMEN WITH GDM. IT SHOULD BE RECOMMENDED IN CLINICAL AND COMMUNITY HEALTH SERVICES.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
12 1824  39 PSYCHO-NEURO-ENDOCRINE-IMMUNE MECHANISMS OF ACTION OF YOGA IN TYPE II DIABETES. YOGA HAS BEEN FOUND TO BENEFIT ALL THE COMPONENTS OF HEALTH VIZ. PHYSICAL, MENTAL, SOCIAL AND SPIRITUAL WELL BEING BY INCORPORATING A WIDE VARIETY OF PRACTICES. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF TYPE II DM AND CO-MORBIDITIES IN TYPE II DM HAS BEEN CORRELATED WITH STRESS MECHANISMS. STRESS SUPPRESSES BODY'S IMMUNE SYSTEM AND NEURO-HUMORAL ACTIONS THEREBY AFF ECTING NORMAL PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE. IT WOULD NOT BE WRONG TO STATE THAT CORRELATION OF DIABETES WITH STRESS, ANXIETY AND OTHER PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS ARE BIDIRECTIONAL AND LEAD TO DIFFICULTY IN UNDERSTANDING THE INTERRELATED MECHANISMS. TYPE II DM CANNOT BE UNDERSTOOD IN ISOLATION WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS SUCH AS STRESS, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, NEURO-ENDOCRINE AND IMMUNOLOGICAL FACTORS. THERE IS NO REVIEW WHICH TRIES TO UNDERSTAND THESE MECHANISMS EXCLUSIVELY. THE PRESENT LITERATURE REVIEW AIMS TO UNDERSTAND INTERRELATED PSYCHO-NEURO-ENDOCRINE AND IMMUNOLOGICAL MECHANISMS OF ACTION OF YOGA IN TYPE II DIABETES MELLITUS. PUBLISHED LITERATURE CONCERNING MECHANISMS OF ACTION OF YOGA IN TYPE II DM EMPHASIZING PSYCHO-NEURO-ENDOCRINE OR IMMUNOLOGICAL RELATIONS WAS RETRIEVED FROM PUBMED USING KEY WORDS YOGA, TYPE II DIABETES MELLITUS, PSYCHOLOGICAL, NEURAL, ENDOCRINE, IMMUNE AND MECHANISM OF ACTION. THOSE STUDIES WHICH EXPLAINED THE PSYCHO-NEUROENDOCRINE AND IMMUNE MECHANISMS OF ACTION OF YOGA WERE INCLUDED AND REST WERE EXCLUDED. ALTHOUGH PRIMARY AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXPLAIN THESE MECHANISMS IN TYPE II DM, SOME STUDIES IN NON-DIABETIC POPULATION WHICH HAD A SIMILAR PATHWAY OF STRESS MECHANISM WAS INCLUDED BECAUSE MANY INSIGHTFUL STUDIES WERE AVAILABLE IN THAT AREA. SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED USING TERMS YOGA OR YOGIC AND DIABETES OR DIABETIC IN TITLE OR ABSTRACT FOR ENGLISH ARTICLES. OF THE 89 ARTICLES, WE EXCLUDED NON-ENGLISH ARTICLES (22), EDITORIALS (20) AND LETTERS TO EDITOR (10). 37 STUDIES WERE CONSIDERED FOR THIS REVIEW. THE POSTULATED MECHANISM OF ACTION OF YOGA IS THROUGH PARASYMPATHETIC ACTIVATION AND THE ASSOCIATED ANTI STRESS MECHANISM. IT REDUCES PERCEIVED STRESS AND HPA AXIS ACTIVATION THEREBY IMPROVING OVERALL METABOLIC AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILES, INCREASING INSULIN SENSITIVITY, AND IMPROVING GLUCOSE TOLERANCE AND LIPID METABOLISM. YOGA HAS POSITIVE EFFECTS ON IMMUNE SYSTEM OF DIABETICS.- OVERALL, TYPE II DM IS INFLUENCED BY PSYCHO-NEURO-ENDOCRINE AND IMMUNE MECHANISMS WHERE YOGA HAS IMPORTANT POSITIVE ROLE IN COMBATING STRESSORS AND IMPROVING THESE SYSTEMS TO REGAIN HEALTH.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                
13  705  53 EFFECT OF INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY ON AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY (IAYT) HAD SHOWN BENEFICIAL EFFECTS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM). AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION IS ONE OF THE MAJOR COMPLICATIONS OF TYPE 2 DM. RESEARCH STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT YOGA CAN MODULATE AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS. HENCE, THE CURRENT STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF IAYT ON AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS IN TYPE 2 DIABETICS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 15 PATIENTS OF TYPE 2 DM WITH AGES RANGING FROM 35 TO 60 YEARS WERE RECRUITED FOR THE STUDY. THEY WERE DIAGNOSED WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES FROM 1-YEAR TO 15 YEARS. ASSESSMENTS WERE MADE ON DAY 1 (BEFORE YOGA) AND DAY 7 (AFTER 1-WEEK OF YOGA PRACTICE). HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV), BLOOD PRESSURE (BP) RESPONSE TO THE ISOMETRIC HANDGRIP AND HEART RATE RESPONSE TO DEEP BREATHING WERE ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER 1-WEEK OF IAYT. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE FROM 154.67-130.27 MG/DL (WILCOXON SIGNED RANK TEST, P = 0.029) FOLLOWING 1-WEEK OF IAYT. BP RESPONSE TO ISOMETRIC HAND GRIP IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY (WILCOXON SIGNED RANK TEST, P = 0.01). THERE WAS NO STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN HRV COMPONENTS AND HEART RATE RESPONSE TO DEEP BREATHING TEST. HOWEVER, THERE WAS A TREND OF INCREASE IN THE LOW FREQUENCY POWER (41.07%), HIGH FREQUENCY POWER (6.29%), TOTAL POWER (5.38%), AND STANDARD DEVIATION OF ALL NN INTERVALS (SDNN) (6.29%). CONCLUSION: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT, IAYT IMPROVED AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS IN TYPE 2 DIABETES PATIENTS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
14  685  45 EFFECT OF AN INTEGRATED NATUROPATHY AND YOGA PROGRAM ON LONG-TERM GLYCEMIC CONTROL IN TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS PATIENTS: A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY. AIM: LIFESTYLE IS AN IMPORTANT RISK FACTOR FOR INCREASING THE PREVALENCE OF DIABETES IN THE INDIAN POPULATION. IN THIS STUDY, WE EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF NATUROPATHY TREATMENT, SALT-RESTRICTED LOW-CALORIE DIETS, AND YOGA IN LONG-TERM GLYCEMIC CONTROL IN PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS. METHODS: IN THIS PROSPECTIVE, LONGITUDINAL, TWO-ARM COHORT STUDY, PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS REFERRED FROM A TERTIARY CARE CENTER UNDERGOING A 3-MONTH RESIDENTIAL NATUROPATHY TREATMENT WERE COMPARED WITH THOSE UNDERGOING ONLY CONVENTIONAL MANAGEMENT ON GLYCEMIC CONTROL. BOTH FASTING AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE (PPBG) LEVELS WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE, 3 MONTHS FOLLOWING INTERVENTION, AT 6 MONTHS, AND 12 MONTHS FROM THE STUDY START. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING REPEATED-MEASURES ANOVA WITH POST HOC BONFERRONI CORRECTION. RESULTS: NATUROPATHY AND YOGA INTERVENTION SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED PPBG LEVELS (P < 0.001), GLYCATED HEMOGLOBIN LEVELS (P < 0.001), AND REDUCED REQUIREMENT FOR ANTIDIABETIC MEDICATIONS (P < 0.008) IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP COMPARED TO CONTROLS. THE EFFECTS WERE MORE PROFOUND IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING INTERVENTION AND LASTED UP TO 6 MONTHS FROM THE START OF THE STUDY. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS SUGGEST BENEFIT WITH AN INTENSIVE RESIDENTIAL NATUROPATHY-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION PROGRAM. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS ARE NEEDED TO FURTHER VALIDATE THE FINDINGS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
15  625  34 DIABETIC YOGA PROTOCOL IMPROVES GLYCEMIC, ANTHROPOMETRIC AND LIPID LEVELS IN HIGH RISK INDIVIDUALS FOR DIABETES: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL FROM NORTHERN INDIA. PURPOSE: TO STUDY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DIABETIC YOGA PROTOCOL (DYP) AGAINST MANAGEMENT OF CARDIOVASCULAR RISK PROFILE IN A HIGH-RISK COMMUNITY FOR DIABETES, FROM CHANDIGARH, INDIA. METHODS: THE STUDY WAS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, CONDUCTED AS A SUB STUDY OF THE PAN INDIA TRIAL NIYANTRITA MADHUMEHA BHARATH (NMB). THE COHORT WAS IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE INDIAN DIABETES RISK SCORING (IDRS) (>/= 60) AND A TOTAL OF 184 INDIVIDUALS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO INTERVENTION (N = 91) AND CONTROL GROUPS (N = 93). THE DYP GROUP UNDERWENT THE SPECIFIC DYP TRAINING WHEREAS THE CONTROL GROUP FOLLOWED THEIR DAILY REGIMEN. THE STUDY OUTCOMES INCLUDED CHANGES IN GLYCEMIC AND LIPID PROFILE. ANALYSIS WAS DONE UNDER INTENT-TO-TREAT PRINCIPLE. RESULTS: THE 3 MONTHS DYP PRACTICE SHOWED DIVERSE RESULTS SHOWING GLYCEMIC AND LIPID PROFILE OF THE HIGH RISK INDIVIDUALS. THREE MONTHS OF DYP INTERVENTION WAS FOUND TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE LEVELS OF POST-PRANDIAL GLUCOSE LEVELS (P = 0.035) AND LDL-C LEVELS (P = 0.014) AND WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: THE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE DYP INTERVENTION COULD IMPROVE THE METABOLIC STATUS OF THE HIGH-DIABETES-RISK INDIVIDUALS WITH RESPECT TO THEIR GLUCOSE TOLERANCE AND LIPID LEVELS, PARTIALLY EXPLAINED BY THE REDUCTION IN ABDOMINAL OBESITY.

16  876  62 EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY ON REACTION TIME, BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS AND WELLNESS SCORE OF PERI AND POST-MENOPAUSAL DIABETIC PATIENTS. BACKGROUND: YOGIC PRACTICES MAY AID IN THE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES MELLITUS (DM) AND REDUCE CARDIOVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS IN THE POPULATION. THE PRESENT STUDY HAS BEEN UNDERTAKEN TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY ON REACTION TIME, BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS AND WELLNESS SCORE OF PERI AND POST-MENOPAUSAL DIABETIC PATIENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 15 PERI AND POST-MENOPAUSAL PATIENTS RECEIVING STANDARD MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR TYPE 2 DM WERE RECRUITED AND REACTION TIME AND BIOCHEMICAL INVESTIGATIONS WERE DONE BEFORE AND AFTER A COMPREHENSIVE YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM COMPRISING OF THREE TIMES A WEEK SESSIONS FOR SIX WEEKS. A POST-INTERVENTION, RETROSPECTIVE WELLNESS QUESTIONNAIRE COMPILED BY ACYTER WAS USED TO EVALUATE THE COMPARATIVE FEELINGS OF THE PATIENTS AFTER THE THERAPY PROGRAM. RESULTS: YOGA TRAINING REDUCED AUDITORY REACTION TIME (ART) FROM RIGHT AS WELL AS LEFT HAND, THE DECREASE BEING STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P<0.05) FOR ART FROM THE RIGHT HAND. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT (P<0.01) DECREASE IN FASTING AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS AS WELL AS LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN. THE DECREASE IN TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDES, AND VERY LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN AND INCREASE IN HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN WAS ALSO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P<0.05). ALL THE LIPID RATIOS SHOWED DESIRABLE IMPROVEMENT WITH A DECREASE (P<0.01) OF TC/HDL AND LDL/HDL RATIOS AND INCREASE (P<0.05) IN THE HDL/LDL RATIO. DISCUSSION OR CONCLUSION: SHORTENING OF RT IMPLIES AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE INFORMATION PROCESSING AND REFLEXES AND IS THE FIRST SUCH REPORT IN DIABETIC PATIENTS. THIS HAS CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE AND IS WORTH FURTHER EXPLORATION WITH WIDER, WELL CONTROLLED, RANDOMIZED STUDIES IN THE DIABETIC POPULATION. CHANGES IN BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS MAY BE DUE TO IMPROVED INSULIN SENSITIVITY, DECLINE IN INSULIN RESISTANCE AND INCREASED SENSITIVITY OF THE PANCREATIC B CELLS TO GLUCOSE SIGNALS. YOGA IMPROVED THE 'HEART FRIENDLY' STATUS OF LIPID PROFILE IN OUR SUBJECTS AND AS OUR PARTICIPANTS WERE PERI AND POST-MENOPAUSAL, THE DECREASE IN CARDIOVASCULAR RISK PROFILE IS OF GREATER SIGNIFICANCE. A COMPREHENSIVE YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ENHANCE THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF STANDARD MEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES MELLITUS AND CAN BE USED AS AN EFFECTIVE COMPLEMENTARY OR INTEGRATIVE THERAPY PROGRAM.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
17 1104  44 EFFECTS OF YOGA VERSUS SHAM YOGA ON OXIDATIVE STRESS, GLYCEMIC STATUS, AND ANTHROPOMETRY IN TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS: A SINGLE-BLINDED RANDOMIZED PILOT STUDY. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN A BENEFICIAL ROLE OF YOGA IN TRE A T I N G TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS. THE PRESENT STUDY PROCEEDS IN THE FIELD BY PROVIDING AN ACTIVE CONTROL. WE AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF 3 MONTHS OF YOGA ON OXIDATIVE STRESS, GLYCEMIC STATUS, AND ANTHROPOMETRY IN TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS. FORTY PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE EITHER YOGA (N = 20) OR SHAM YOGA (N = 20) AS A CONTROL. YOGA INCLUDED POSTURES AND BREATHING EXERCISES, AND NONAEROBIC STRETCHING EXERCISE COMPRISED THE CONTROL. SIGNIFICANT WITHIN-GROUP DIFFERENCES IN MALONDIALDEHYDE, VITAMIN C, SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE, FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE, GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN, BODY MASS INDEX, WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE, AND BLOOD PRESSURE WERE EVIDENT IN BOTH GROUPS. YOGA PARTICIPANTS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN REDUCED GLUTATHIONE COMPARED TO CONTROLS. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS WERE OBSERVED IN ANY OTHER OUTCOME VARIABLES. YOGA AND SHAM YOGA HAD IDENTICAL EFFECTS ON OXIDATIVE STRESS, GLYCEMIC STATUS, AND ANTHROPOMETRY IN TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS. LEVELS OF REDUCED GLUTATHIONE IMPROVED ONLY IN THE YOGA GROUP. THIS RESEARCH NEEDS TO BE CONFIRMED BY LARGER AND SUFFICIENTLY POWERED STUDIES.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
18  926  48 EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA LIFESTYLE ON LIPID METABOLISM IN A VULNERABLE POPULATION-A COMMUNITY BASED MULTICENTER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: DYSLIPIDEMIA POSES A HIGH RISK FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND STROKE IN TYPE 2 DIABETES (T2DM). THERE ARE NO STUDIES ON THE IMPACT OF A VALIDATED INTEGRATED YOGA LIFESTYLE PROTOCOL ON LIPID PROFILES IN A HIGH-RISK DIABETES POPULATION. METHODS: HERE, WE REPORT THE RESULTS OF LIPID PROFILE VALUES OF 11,254 (YOGA 5932 AND CONTROL 5322) ADULTS (20-70 YEARS) OF BOTH GENDERS WITH HIGH RISK (>/=60 ON INDIAN DIABETES RISK SCORE) FOR DIABETES FROM A NATIONWIDE RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITY-BASED TWO GROUP (YOGA AND CONVENTIONAL MANAGEMENT) CLUSTER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. THE YOGA GROUP PRACTICED A VALIDATED INTEGRATED YOGA LIFESTYLE PROTOCOL (DYP) IN NINE DAY CAMPS FOLLOWED BY DAILY ONE-HOUR PRACTICE. BIOCHEMICAL PROFILING INCLUDED GLYCATED HEMOGLOBIN AND LIPID PROFILES BEFORE AND AFTER THREE MONTHS. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS (P < 0.001 ANCOVA) WITH IMPROVED SERUM TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDES, LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN, AND HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN IN THE YOGA GROUP COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. FURTHER, THE REGULATORY EFFECT OF YOGA WAS NOTED WITH A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE OR INCREASE IN THOSE WITH HIGH OR LOW VALUES OF LIPIDS, RESPECTIVELY, WITH MARGINAL OR NO CHANGE IN THOSE WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE. CONCLUSION: YOGA LIFESTYLE IMPROVES AND REGULATES (LOWERED IF HIGH, INCREASED IF LOW) THE BLOOD LIPID LEVELS IN BOTH GENDERS OF PREDIABETIC AND DIABETIC INDIVIDUALS IN BOTH RURAL AND URBAN INDIAN COMMUNITIES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
19 2007  45 STUDY OF YOGA ASANAS IN ASSESSMENT OF PULMONARY FUNCTION IN NIDDM PATIENTS. CERTAIN YOGA ASANAS IF PRACTICED REGULARLY ARE KNOWN TO HAVE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON HUMAN BODY. THESE YOGA PRACTICES MIGHT BE INTERACTING WITH VARIOUS, SOMATO-NEURO-ENDOCRINE MECHANISMS TO HAVE THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS. THE PRESENT STUDY DONE IN TWENTY FOUR NIDDM PATIENTS OF 30 TO 60 YEAR OLD, PROVIDES METABOLIC AND CLINICAL EVIDENCE OF IMPROVEMENT IN GLYCAEMIC CONTROL AND PULMONARY FUNCTIONS. THESE MIDDLE-AGED SUBJECTS WERE TYPE II DIABETICS ON ANTIHYPERGLYCAEMIC AND DIETARY REGIMEN. THEIR BASELINE FASTING AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE AND GLYCOSYLATED HB WERE MONITORED ALONG WITH PULMONARY FUNCTION STUDIES. THE EXPERT GAVE THESE PATIENTS TRAINING IN YOGA ASANAS AND WERE PURSED 30-40 MIN/DAY FOR 40 DAYS UNDER GUIDANCE. THESE ASANAS CONSISTED OF 13 WELL KNOWN POSTURES, DONE IN A SEQUENCE. AFTER 40 DAYS OF YOGA ASANAS REGIMEN, THE PARAMETERS WERE REPEATED. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS (BASAL 190.08 +/- 90.8 IN MG/DL TO 141.5 +/- 79.8 IN MG/DL). THE POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS ALSO DECREASED (276.54 +/- 101.0 IN MG/DL TO 201.75 +/- 104.1 IN MG/DL), GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN SHOWED A DECREASE (9.03 +/- 1.4% TO 7.83 +/- 2.6%). THE FEV1, FVC, PEFR, MVV INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (1.81 +/- 0.4 LT TO 2.08 +/- 0.4 LT, 2.20 +/- 0.6 LT TO 2.37 +/- 0.5 LT, 3.30 +/- 1.0 LT/S TO 4.43 +/- 1.4 LT/S AND 64.59 +/- 25.7 LT MIN TO 76.28 +/- 28.1 LT/MIN RESPECTIVELY). FEV1/FVC% IMPROVED (85 +/- 0.2% TO 89 +/- 0.1%). THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT BETTER GLYCAEMIC CONTROL AND PULMONARY FUNCTIONS CAN BE OBTAINED IN NIDDM CASES WITH YOGA ASANAS AND PRANAYAMA. THE EXACT MECHANISM AS TO HOW THESE POSTURES AND CONTROLLED BREATHING, INTERACT WITH SOMATO-NEURO-ENDOCRINE MECHANISM AFFECTING METABOLIC AND PULMONARY FUNCTIONS REMAINS TO BE WORKED OUT.	2002	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
20 1924  37 ROLE OF YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH TYPE II DIABETES MELLITUS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE AND EFFICACY OF YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS, THIS META-ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED. ELECTRONIC DATA BASES SEARCHED WERE PUBMED/MEDLINE, PROQUEST, PSYCINFO, INDMED, CENTRAL, COCHRANE LIBRARY, CAMQUEST AND CAMBASE TILL DECEMBER 17, 2014. ELIGIBLE OUTCOMES WERE FASTING BLOOD SUGAR (FBS), POST PRANDIAL BLOOD SUGAR (PPBS) AND GLYCOSYLATED HAEMOGLOBIN (HBA1C). RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS AND CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE ELIGIBLE. STUDIES FOCUSSING ONLY ON RELAXATION OR MEDITATION OR MULTIMODAL INTERVENTION WERE NOT INCLUDED. A TOTAL OF 17 RCTS WERE INCLUDED FOR REVIEW. DATA FROM RESEARCH ARTICLES ON PATIENTS, METHODS, INTERVENTIONS- CONTROL AND RESULTS WERE EXTRACTED. MEAN AND STANDARD DEVIATIONS WERE UTILIZED FOR CALCULATING STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE WITH 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL. HETEROGENEITY WAS ASSESSED WITH THE HELP OF I(2) STATISTICS. CHI(2) WAS USED TO RULE OUT THE EFFECTS OF HETEROGENEITY DUE TO CHANCE ALONE. BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA AS AN ADD-ON INTERVENTION TO STANDARD TREATMENT IN COMPARISON TO STANDARD TREATMENT WERE OBSERVED FOR FBS [STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCE (SMD) -1.40, 95%CI -1.90 TO -0.90, P<0.00001]; PPBS [SMD -0.91, 95%CI -1.34 TO -0.48, P<0.0001] AS WELL AS HBA1C [SMD -0.64, 95%CI -0.97 TO -0.30, P<0.0002]. BUT RISK OF BIAS WAS OVERALL HIGH FOR INCLUDED STUDIES. WITH THIS AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, YOGA CAN BE CONSIDERED AS ADD-ON INTERVENTION FOR MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES.	2016

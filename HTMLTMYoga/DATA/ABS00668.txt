1  668 178 EFFECT OF A 16-WEEK BIKRAM YOGA PROGRAM ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY AND ASSOCIATED CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK FACTORS IN STRESSED AND SEDENTARY ADULTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC ACTIVATION OF THE STRESS-RESPONSE CAN CONTRIBUTE TO CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK, PARTICULARLY IN SEDENTARY INDIVIDUALS. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECT OF A BIKRAM YOGA INTERVENTION ON THE HIGH FREQUENCY POWER COMPONENT OF HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) AND ASSOCIATED CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (CVD) RISK FACTORS (I.E. ADDITIONAL DOMAINS OF HRV, HEMODYNAMIC, HEMATOLOGIC, ANTHROPOMETRIC AND BODY COMPOSITION OUTCOME MEASURES) IN STRESSED AND SEDENTARY ADULTS. METHODS: ELIGIBLE ADULTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO AN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (N = 29) OR A NO TREATMENT CONTROL GROUP (N = 34). EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PARTICIPANTS WERE INSTRUCTED TO ATTEND THREE TO FIVE SUPERVISED BIKRAM YOGA CLASSES PER WEEK FOR 16 WEEKS AT LOCAL STUDIOS. OUTCOME MEASURES WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE (WEEK 0) AND COMPLETION (WEEK 17). RESULTS: SIXTY-THREE ADULTS (37.2 +/- 10.8 YEARS, 79% WOMEN) WERE INCLUDED IN THE INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP ATTENDED 27 +/- 18 CLASSES. ANALYSES OF COVARIANCE REVEALED NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE HIGH-FREQUENCY COMPONENT OF HRV (P = 0.912, PARTIAL ETA (2) = 0.000) OR IN ANY SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE BETWEEN GROUPS OVER TIME. HOWEVER, REGRESSION ANALYSES REVEALED THAT HIGHER ATTENDANCE IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (P = 0.039; PARTIAL ETA (2) = 0.154), BODY FAT PERCENTAGE (P = 0.001, PARTIAL ETA (2) = 0.379), FAT MASS (P = 0.003, PARTIAL ETA (2) = 0.294) AND BODY MASS INDEX (P = 0.05, PARTIAL ETA (2) = 0.139). CONCLUSIONS: A 16-WEEK BIKRAM YOGA PROGRAM DID NOT INCREASE THE HIGH FREQUENCY POWER COMPONENT OF HRV OR ANY OTHER CVD RISK FACTORS INVESTIGATED. AS REVEALED BY POST HOC ANALYSES, LOW ADHERENCE LIKELY CONTRIBUTED TO THE NULL EFFECTS. FUTURE STUDIES ARE REQUIRED TO ADDRESS BARRIERS TO ADHERENCE TO BETTER ELUCIDATE THE DOSE-RESPONSE EFFECTS OF BIKRAM YOGA PRACTICE AS A MEDIUM TO LOWER STRESS-RELATED CVD RISK.

2 1781  70 PREDICTORS OF AND BARRIERS TO ADHERENCE IN A 16-WEEK RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF BIKRAM YOGA IN STRESSED AND SEDENTARY ADULTS. BACKGROUND: BIKRAM YOGA MAY ENHANCE HEALTH OUTCOMES IN HEALTHY ADULTS AND THOSE AT RISK FOR CHRONIC DISEASE, HOWEVER, CHALLENGES REMAIN IN ACHIEVING OPTIMAL ADHERENCE TO THIS PRACTICE. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED FACTORS INFLUENCING ADHERENCE TO A 16-WEEK BIKRAM YOGA INTERVENTION IN STRESSED AND SEDENTARY ADULTS. METHODS: EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PARTICIPANTS (N = 29) WERE INSTRUCTED TO ATTEND 3-5 BIKRAM YOGA CLASSES WEEKLY FOR 16 WEEKS. BASELINE DEMOGRAPHICS, BEHAVIOURS AND HEALTH MEASURES WERE INVESTIGATED AS PREDICTORS OF ADHERENCE. BARRIERS WERE ASSESSED VIA DOCUMENTATION OF ADVERSE EVENTS, AND EXIT SURVEY RESPONSES. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS (38.2 +/- 10.1 YEARS) WERE PREDOMINANTLY OVERWEIGHT-OBESE (83%), FEMALE (79%), AND ATTENDED 27 +/- 18 CLASSES. HIGHER ADHERENCE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH OLDER AGE (P = 0.094), LESS PAIN (P = 0.011), FEWER PHYSICAL LIMITATIONS (P = 0.011), POORER BLOOD LIPID PROFILE, AND HIGHER HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV; TOTAL POWER, (P = 0.097)). IN MULTI-VARIABLE ANALYSIS, THREE VARIABLES: AGE (BETA = 0.492, P = 0.006), HRV (BETA = 0.413, P = 0.021) AND PAIN (BETA = 0.329, P = 0.048) REMAINED PREDICTORS OF ADHERENCE. DIFFICULTY COMMITTING TO THE TRIAL, LACK OF ENJOYMENT AND ADVERSE EVENTS WERE BARRIERS TO ADHERENCE. CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF FUTURE BIKRAM YOGA TRIALS TO FACILITATE HIGHER LEVELS OF ADHERENCE, WHICH MAY ENHANCE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND INFORM COMMUNITY PRACTICE. FUTURE TRIALS SHOULD INVESTIGATE AND ADDRESS ADDITIONAL BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS OF BIKRAM YOGA PRACTICE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
3  687  79 EFFECT OF AN OFFICE WORKSITE-BASED YOGA PROGRAM ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY: OUTCOMES OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC WORK-RELATED STRESS IS AN INDEPENDENT RISK FACTOR FOR CARDIOMETABOLIC DISEASES AND ASSOCIATED MORTALITY, PARTICULARLY WHEN COMPOUNDED BY A SEDENTARY WORK ENVIRONMENT. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE IF AN OFFICE WORKSITE-BASED HATHA YOGA PROGRAM COULD IMPROVE PHYSIOLOGICAL STRESS, EVALUATED VIA HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV), AND ASSOCIATED HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOMES IN A COHORT OF OFFICE WORKERS. METHODS: THIRTY-SEVEN ADULTS EMPLOYED IN UNIVERSITY-BASED OFFICE POSITIONS WERE RANDOMIZED UPON THE COMPLETION OF BASELINE TESTING TO AN EXPERIMENTAL OR CONTROL GROUP. THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP COMPLETED A 10-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM PRESCRIBED THREE SESSIONS PER WEEK DURING LUNCH HOUR (50 MIN PER SESSION). AN EXPERIENCED INSTRUCTOR LED THE SESSIONS, WHICH EMPHASIZED ASANAS (POSTURES) AND VINYASA (EXERCISES). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS THE HIGH FREQUENCY (HF) POWER COMPONENT OF HRV. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED ADDITIONAL HRV PARAMETERS, MUSCULOSKELETAL FITNESS (I.E. PUSH-UP, SIDE-BRIDGE, AND SIT & REACH TESTS) AND PSYCHOLOGICAL INDICES (I.E. STATE AND TRAIT ANXIETY, QUALITY OF LIFE AND JOB SATISFACTION). RESULTS: ALL MEASURES OF HRV FAILED TO CHANGE IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP VERSUS THE CONTROL GROUP, EXCEPT THAT THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED LF:HF (P = 0.04) AND REDUCED PNN50 (P = 0.04) VERSUS CONTROL, CONTRARY TO OUR HYPOTHESES. FLEXIBILITY, EVALUATED VIA SIT & REACH TEST INCREASED IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP VERSUS THE CONTROL GROUP (P < 0.001). NO OTHER ADAPTATIONS WERE NOTED. POST HOC ANALYSIS COMPARING PARTICIPANTS WHO COMPLETED >/=70% OF YOGA SESSIONS (N = 11) TO CONTROL (N = 19) YIELDED THE SAME FINDINGS, EXCEPT THAT THE HIGH ADHERERS ALSO REDUCED STATE ANXIETY (P = 0.02) AND RMSSD (P = 0.05), AND TENDED TO IMPROVE THE PUSH-UP TEST (P = 0.07) VERSUS CONTROL. CONCLUSIONS: A 10-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION DELIVERED AT THE OFFICE WORKSITE DURING LUNCH HOUR DID NOT IMPROVE HF POWER OR OTHER HRV PARAMETERS. HOWEVER, IMPROVEMENTS IN FLEXIBILITY, STATE ANXIETY AND MUSCULOSKELETAL FITNESS WERE NOTED WITH HIGH ADHERENCE. FUTURE INVESTIGATIONS SHOULD INCORPORATE STRATEGIES TO PROMOTE ADHERENCE, INVOLVE MORE FREQUENT AND LONGER DURATIONS OF YOGA TRAINING, AND ENROL COHORTS WHO SUFFER FROM HIGHER LEVELS OF WORK-RELATED STRESS.

4 1062  51 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IN WOMEN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF A 12-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS IN DEPRESSED WOMEN. METHODS: THIS WAS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. TWENTY-SIX SEDENTARY WOMEN SCORING >/=14 ON THE BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY-II WERE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER THE YOGA OR THE CONTROL GROUP. THE YOGA GROUP COMPLETED A 12-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM, WHICH TOOK PLACE TWICE A WEEK FOR 60 MIN PER SESSION AND CONSISTED OF BREATHING EXERCISES, YOGA POSE PRACTICE, AND SUPINE MEDITATION/RELAXATION. THE CONTROL GROUP WAS INSTRUCTED NOT TO ENGAGE IN ANY YOGA PRACTICE AND TO MAINTAIN THEIR USUAL LEVEL OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY DURING THE COURSE OF THE STUDY. PARTICIPANTS' HRV, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, AND PERCEIVED STRESS WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND POST-TEST. RESULTS: THE YOGA GROUP HAD A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN HIGH-FREQUENCY HRV AND DECREASES IN LOW-FREQUENCY HRV AND LOW FREQUENCY/HIGH FREQUENCY RATIO AFTER THE INTERVENTION. THE YOGA GROUP ALSO REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND PERCEIVED STRESS. NO CHANGE WAS FOUND IN THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: A 12-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM WAS EFFECTIVE IN INCREASING PARASYMPATHETIC TONE AND REDUCING DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND PERCEIVED STRESS IN WOMEN WITH ELEVATED DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE MAY BE RECOMMENDED FOR WOMEN TO COPE WITH THEIR DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND STRESS AND TO IMPROVE THEIR HRV.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
5 1063  46 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY AND MOOD IN WOMEN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF AN 8-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY AND MOOD IN GENERALLY HEALTHY WOMEN. DESIGN: RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. PARTICIPANTS: FIFTY-TWO HEALTHY WOMEN WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A YOGA GROUP OR A CONTROL GROUP. INTERVENTIONS: PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP COMPLETED AN 8-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM, WHICH COMPRISED A 60-MINUTE SESSION TWICE A WEEK. EACH SESSION CONSISTED OF BREATHING EXERCISES, YOGA POSE PRACTICE, AND SUPINE MEDITATION/RELAXATION. THE CONTROL GROUP WAS INSTRUCTED NOT TO ENGAGE IN ANY YOGA PRACTICE AND TO MAINTAIN THEIR USUAL LEVEL OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY DURING THE STUDY. OUTCOME MEASURES: PARTICIPANTS' HEART RATE VARIABILITY, PERCEIVED STRESS, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, AND STATE AND TRAIT ANXIETY WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE (WEEK 0) AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION (WEEK 9). RESULTS: NO MEASURES OF HEART RATE VARIABILITY CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY IN EITHER THE YOGA OR CONTROL GROUP AFTER INTERVENTION. STATE ANXIETY WAS REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE YOGA GROUP BUT NOT IN THE CONTROL GROUP. NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE NOTED IN PERCEIVED STRESS, DEPRESSION, OR TRAIT ANXIETY IN EITHER GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: AN 8-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TO IMPROVE HEART RATE VARIABILITY. HOWEVER, SUCH A PROGRAM APPEARS TO BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING STATE ANXIETY IN GENERALLY HEALTHY WOMEN. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD INVOLVE LONGER PERIODS OF YOGA TRAINING, INCLUDE HEART RATE VARIABILITY MEASURES BOTH AT REST AND DURING YOGA PRACTICE, AND ENROLL WOMEN WITH HIGHER LEVELS OF STRESS AND TRAIT ANXIETY.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
6 1902  53 RESTORATIVE YOGA IN ADULTS WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME: A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED PILOT TRIAL. BACKGROUND: METABOLIC SYNDROME INCREASES THE RISK OF DIABETES AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. YOGA IMPROVES SOME METABOLIC PARAMETERS, BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED IN PERSONS WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME. WE CONDUCTED A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT TRIAL TO DETERMINE WHETHER A RESTORATIVE YOGA INTERVENTION WAS FEASIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE IN UNDERACTIVE, OVERWEIGHT ADULTS WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME. METHODS: TWENTY SIX UNDERACTIVE, OVERWEIGHT ADULT MEN AND WOMEN WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME WERE RANDOMIZED TO ATTEND 15 YOGA SESSIONS OF 90 MINUTES EACH OVER 10 WEEKS OR TO A WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP. FEASIBILITY WAS MEASURED BY RECRUITMENT RATES, SUBJECT RETENTION, AND ADHERENCE. ACCEPTABILITY WAS ASSESSED BY INTERVIEW AND QUESTIONNAIRES. CHANGES IN METABOLIC OUTCOMES AND QUESTIONNAIRE MEASURES FROM BASELINE TO WEEK 10 WERE CALCULATED. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 280 PEOPLE WERE SCREENED BY PHONE, AND 93 WITH HIGH LIKELIHOOD OF METABOLIC SYNDROME WERE INVITED TO A SCREENING VISIT. OF THE 68 WHO ATTENDED SCREENING VISITS, 26 (38%) WERE RANDOMIZED, AND 24 (92%) COMPLETED THE TRIAL. ATTENDANCE AT YOGA CLASSES AND ADHERENCE TO HOME PRACTICE EXCEEDED OUR GOALS. IN THE YOGA GROUP, ALL PARTICIPANTS GAVE THE STUDY THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE SATISFACTION RATING, AND THE MAJORITY (87%) FELT THAT THE YOGA POSES WERE EASY TO PERFORM. THERE WAS TREND TO REDUCED BLOOD PRESSURE (P = 0.07), A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN ENERGY LEVEL (P < 0.009), AND TRENDS TO IMPROVEMENT IN WELL-BEING (P < 0.12) AND STRESS (P < 0.22) IN THE YOGA VERSUS CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: RESTORATIVE YOGA WAS A FEASIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE INTERVENTION IN OVERWEIGHT ADULTS WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME. THE EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR IMPROVING METABOLIC PARAMETERS IN THIS POPULATION SHOULD BE EXPLORED IN A LARGER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
7  990  45 EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA ON STRESS IN MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN. BACKGROUND: STRESS IS CONSIDERED A CRUCIAL TRIGGER FOR PHYSICAL AND MENTAL ILLNESS. STRESS REDUCTION IS A KNOWN LONG-TERM BENEFIT OF REGULAR HATHA YOGA PRACTICE. THE EFFICACY OF A SINGLE-SESSION HATHA YOGA CLASS ON STRESS REDUCTION IS NOT CURRENTLY KNOWN. PURPOSE: THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF A SINGLE 90-MINUTE HATHA YOGA CLASS AND AN 8-WEEK, 90-MINUTE-CLASS-PER-WEEK COURSE. METHODS: WE USED A QUASIEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND RECRUITED 63 FEMALE COMMUNITY RESIDENTS IN NEW TAIPEI CITY AGED 40-60 YEARS. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO AN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (N = 30) AND A CONTROL GROUP (N = 33). THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP RECEIVED THE 8-WEEK HATHA YOGA COURSE. THE CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED NO INTERVENTION. THE PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE (PSS) AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) ASSESSED STRESS REDUCTION EFFECTIVENESS. CHI-SQUARE, INDEPENDENT T TEST, PAIRED T TEST, AND GENERALIZED ESTIMATING EQUATIONS WERE USED FOR DATA ANALYSIS. RESULTS: AFTER A SINGLE 90-MINUTE CLASS OF HATHA YOGA, EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PSS SCORES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THOSE OF THE CONTROL GROUP (P = .001). ALTHOUGH EXPERIMENTAL GROUP HRV (LOW-FREQUENCY NORM AND HIGH-FREQUENCY NORM) HAD IMPROVED, THESE CHANGES WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P = .059). PSS SCORES FOR THE SINGLE 90-MINUTE CLASS AND 8-WEEK COURSE DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFER (P = .157) AND HRV OF STATISTICS IS SIGNIFICANT (P = .005). GENERALIZED ESTIMATING EQUATIONS ANALYZED CHANGES IN THE EFFECTIVENESS OVER TIME OF STRESS REDUCTION (HRV AND PSS) AFTER THE HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION. RESULTS SHOWED THE POSTINTERVENTION HRV AND PSS OF THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (P < .001) MORE THAN THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: OUR FINDINGS SUPPORT THE POSITION THAT REGULAR, LONG-TERM PRACTICE OF HATHA YOGA PROVIDES CLEAR AND SIGNIFICANT HEALTH BENEFITS. PARTICIPATION IN A SINGLE 90-MINUTE HATHA YOGA CLASS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE PERCEIVED STRESS. DOING HATHA YOGA REGULARLY CAN REDUCE PERCEIVED STRESS EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANTLY.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
8  279  52 ADHERENCE AND RETENTION OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH A YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION: THE EFFECTS OF HEALTH PROMOTING PROGRAMS ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE RISK STUDY. OBJECTIVES: SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE IS A RISK FACTOR FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (CVD). FEW ALTERNATIVE LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS YOGA PRACTICE, FOCUS ON AFRICAN AMERICANS (AA), THE POPULATION MOST VULNERABLE TO CVD. OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO COMPARE THE RETENTION AND ADHERENCE RATES BETWEEN YOGA, WALKING, AND HEALTH EDUCATION INTERVENTIONS WHILE PROVIDING INFORMATION ABOUT THE ACCEPTANCE OF VARIOUS YOGA REGIMENS. DESIGN: THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY-FIVE AA PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED EXCLUSIVELY FROM AN ACTIVE COHORT STUDY AND RANDOMIZED INTO A 48-WEEK STUDY (24 WEEKS INTERVENTION, 24 WEEKS FOLLOW-UP) WITH 5 HEALTH PROMOTION INTERVENTIONS: HIGH FREQUENCY YOGA, MODERATE FREQUENCY YOGA, LOW FREQUENCY YOGA, GUIDED WALKING, AND HEALTH EDUCATION. IN ADDITION TO EXAMINING THE SEPARATE YOGA INTERVENTIONS, A POOLED YOGA INTERVENTION IS CONSIDERED FOR COMPARISON TO GUIDED WALKING AND HEALTH EDUCATION. PARTICIPANT RETENTION, ADHERENCE, AND VITALS WERE MONITORED AT EACH INTERVENTION SESSION. PARTICIPANTS WERE ALSO SCHEDULED FOR FOUR CLINIC VISITS THROUGHOUT THE STUDY WHERE BLOOD PANELS, HEALTH BEHAVIOR, AND MEDICATION SURVEYS WERE ADMINISTERED. RESULTS: OF THE 375 PARTICIPANTS RECRUITED, 31.7% DID NOT COMPLETE THE STUDY. AT BASELINE, IN BOTH THE GUIDED WALKING GROUP AND THE HIGH FREQUENCY YOGA GROUP, THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THOSE WHO COMPLETED THE STUDY AND THOSE WHO DID NOT. ALTHOUGH INTERVENTION RETENTION IN THE POOLED YOGA PROGRAM (78.3%) WAS HIGHER COMPARED TO THE WALKING (60%) AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS (74.3%) (P = 0.007), DIFFERENCES IN POST-INTERVENTION RETENTION WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT. MEDIAN ADHERENCE RATES FOR THE POOLED YOGA PROGRAM EXCEEDED RATES FOR GUIDED WALKING AND EDUCATION WITH MODERATE FREQUENCY YOGA OUT PERFORMING HIGH AND LOW FREQUENCY YOGA. CONCLUSION: STUDY-DEFINED RETENTION SUCCESS RATES WERE NOT REACHED BY ALL HEALTH PROMOTION PROGRAMS. HOWEVER, RETENTION AND ADHERENCE RATES FOR THE POOLED YOGA PROGRAM SHOW THAT OLDER AFRICAN AMERICANS ARE RECEPTIVE TO PARTICIPATING IN YOGA-BASED HEALTH PROMOTION PRACTICES.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
9   60  41 A COMPARISON OF THE EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA AND RESISTANCE EXERCISE ON MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING IN SEDENTARY ADULTS: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVES: PHYSICAL ACTIVITY HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON PEOPLE'S MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA AND RESISTANCE EXERCISES ON MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING IN SEDENTARY ADULTS. DESIGN: RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. METHODS: FIFTY-ONE PARTICIPANTS AGED MEAN (SD) 25.6 (5.7) YEARS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO THREE GROUPS: HATHA YOGA GROUP, RESISTANCE EXERCISE GROUP AND CONTROL GROUP. THE HATHA YOGA GROUP AND RESISTANCE EXERCISE GROUP PARTICIPATED IN SESSIONS THREE DAYS PER WEEK FOR 7 WEEKS AND THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN ANY SESSIONS. ALL THE SUBJECTS WERE EVALUATED THROUGH THE ROSENBERG SELF-ESTEEM SCALE, BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY, BODY CATHEXIS SCALE, NOTTINGHAM HEALTH PROFILE AND VISUAL ANALOG SCALE FOR FATIGUE PRE-AND POST-SESSION. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE FOUND IN TERMS OF ALL OUTCOME MEASURES IN THE HATHA YOGA GROUP AND THE RESISTANCE EXERCISE GROUP. NO IMPROVEMENTS WERE FOUND IN THE CONTROL GROUP. HATHA YOGA MORE IMPROVED THE DIMENSIONS FATIGUE, SELF-ESTEEM, AND QUALITY OF LIFE, WHILST RESISTANCE EXERCISE TRAINING MORE IMPROVED BODY IMAGE. HATHA YOGA AND RESISTANCE EXERCISE DECREASED DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AT A SIMILAR LEVEL. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT HATHA YOGA AND RESISTANCE EXERCISE HAD POSITIVE EFFECTS ON MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING IN SEDENTARY ADULTS. HATHA YOGA AND RESISTANCE EXERCISE MAY AFFECT DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
10 1402  58 IMPACT OF YOGA ON BLOOD PRESSURE AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION - A CONTROLLED TRIAL IN PRIMARY CARE, MATCHED FOR SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE. BACKGROUND: MEDICAL TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION IS NOT ALWAYS SUFFICIENT TO ACHIEVE BLOOD PRESSURE CONTROL. DESPITE THIS, PREVIOUS STUDIES ON SUPPLEMENTARY THERAPIES, SUCH AS YOGA, ARE RELATIVELY FEW. WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF TWO YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON BLOOD PRESSURE AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE DIAGNOSED WITH HYPERTENSION. METHODS: ADULT PATIENTS (AGE 20-80 YEARS) WITH DIAGNOSED HYPERTENSION WERE IDENTIFIED BY AN ELECTRONIC CHART SEARCH AT A PRIMARY HEALTH CARE CENTER IN SOUTHERN SWEDEN. IN TOTAL, 83 SUBJECTS WITH BLOOD PRESSURE VALUES OF 120-179/</=109 MMHG AT BASELINE WERE ENROLLED. AT BASELINE, THE PATIENTS UNDERWENT STANDARDIZED BLOOD PRESSURE MEASUREMENT AT THE HEALTH CARE CENTER AND THEY COMPLETED A QUESTIONNAIRE ON SELF-RATED QUALITY OF LIFE (WHOQOL-BREF). THERE WERE THREE GROUPS: 1) YOGA CLASS WITH YOGA INSTRUCTOR (N = 28); 2) YOGA AT HOME (N = 28); AND 3) A CONTROL GROUP (N = 27). THE PARTICIPANTS WERE MATCHED AT THE GROUP LEVEL FOR SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE. AFTER 12 WEEKS OF INTERVENTION, THE ASSESSMENTS WERE PERFORMED AGAIN. AT BASELINE A MAJORITY OF THE PATIENTS (92%) WERE ON ANTIHYPERTENSIVE MEDICATION, AND THE PATIENTS WERE REQUESTED NOT TO CHANGE THEIR MEDICATION DURING THE STUDY. RESULTS: THE YOGA CLASS GROUP SHOWED NO IMPROVEMENT IN BLOOD PRESSURE OR SELF-RATED QUALITY OF LIFE, WHILE IN THE YOGA AT HOME GROUP THERE WAS A DECLINE IN DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE OF 4.4 MMHG (P < 0.05) COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. MOREOVER, THE YOGA AT HOME GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SELF-RATED QUALITY OF LIFE COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A SHORT YOGA PROGRAM FOR THE PATIENT TO PRACTICE AT HOME SEEMS TO HAVE AN ANTIHYPERTENSIVE EFFECT, AS WELL AS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON SELF-RATED QUALITY OF LIFE COMPARED TO CONTROLS. THIS IMPLIES THAT SIMPLE YOGA EXERCISES MAY BE USEFUL AS A SUPPLEMENTARY BLOOD PRESSURE THERAPY IN ADDITION TO MEDICAL TREATMENT WHEN PRESCRIBED BY PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
11  669  79 EFFECT OF A 16-WEEK BIKRAM YOGA PROGRAM ON PERCEIVED STRESS, SELF-EFFICACY AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE IN STRESSED AND SEDENTARY ADULTS: A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVES: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF 16 WEEKS OF BIKRAM YOGA ON PERCEIVED STRESS, SELF-EFFICACY AND HEALTH RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) IN SEDENTARY, STRESSED ADULTS. DESIGN: 16 WEEK, PARALLEL-ARM, RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL WITH FLEXIBLE DOSING. METHODS: PHYSICALLY INACTIVE, STRESSED ADULTS (37.2+/-10.8 YEARS) WERE RANDOMISED TO BIKRAM YOGA (THREE TO FIVE CLASSES PER WEEK) OR CONTROL (NO TREATMENT) GROUP FOR 16 WEEKS. OUTCOME MEASURES, COLLECTED VIA SELF-REPORT, INCLUDED PERCEIVED STRESS, GENERAL SELF-EFFICACY, AND HRQOL. OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE, MIDPOINT AND COMPLETION. RESULTS: INDIVIDUALS WERE RANDOMISED TO THE EXPERIMENTAL (N=29) OR CONTROL GROUP (N=34). AVERAGE ATTENDANCE IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS 27+/-18 CLASSES. REPEATED MEASURE ANALYSES OF VARIANCE (INTENTION-TO-TREAT) DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED PERCEIVED STRESS (P=0.003, PARTIAL ETA(2)=0.109), GENERAL SELF-EFFICACY (P=0.034, PARTIAL ETA(2)=0.056), AND THE GENERAL HEALTH (P=0.034, PARTIAL ETA(2)=0.058) AND ENERGY/FATIGUE (P=0.019, PARTIAL ETA(2)=0.066) DOMAINS OF HRQOL IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP VERSUS THE CONTROL GROUP. ATTENDANCE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCTIONS IN PERCEIVED STRESS, AND AN INCREASE IN SEVERAL DOMAINS OF HRQOL. CONCLUSIONS: 16 WEEKS OF BIKRAM YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED PERCEIVED STRESS, GENERAL SELF-EFFICACY AND HRQOL IN SEDENTARY, STRESSED ADULTS. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD CONSIDER WAYS TO OPTIMISE ADHERENCE, AND SHOULD INVESTIGATE EFFECTS OF BIKRAM YOGA INTERVENTION IN OTHER POPULATIONS AT RISK FOR STRESS-RELATED ILLNESS.

12 2834  53 YOGA'S EFFECT ON INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS AND METABOLIC RISK FACTORS IN A HIGH RISK POPULATION - A CONTROLLED TRIAL IN PRIMARY CARE. BACKGROUND: YOGA CAN REDUCE BLOOD PRESSURE AND HAS ALSO BEEN SUGGESTED TO REDUCE INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS AND METABOLIC RISK FACTORS FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES (CVDS). WE AIMED TO ASSESS THE BENEFIT OF TWO YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS AND METABOLIC RISK FACTORS IN A HIGH RISK POPULATION IN PRIMARY CARE. METHODS: ADULT PATIENTS FROM A HEALTH CARE CENTER IN SWEDEN, WITH DIAGNOSED HYPERTENSION, WERE INVITED TO UNDERGO A BASELINE CHECK AT THE HEALTH CARE CENTER. BASELINE CHECK INCLUDED STANDARDIZED BLOOD PRESSURE MEASUREMENT, BMI AND WEIGHT CIRCUMFERENCE MEASUREMENTS, BLOOD SAMPLING (HS-CRP, IL-6, FP-GLUCOSE, HBA1C, CHOLESTEROL, TG, LDL AND HDL) AND A QUESTIONNAIRE ON SELF-RATED QUALITY OF LIFE (WHOQOL-BREF). THERE WERE THREE GROUPS: 1) YOGA CLASS WITH YOGA INSTRUCTOR; 2) YOGA AT HOME; AND 3) A CONTROL GROUP. IN TOTAL, 83 PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED AND MATCHED AT THE GROUP LEVEL FOR SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE. A MAJORITY OF THE PATIENTS (92 %) WERE ON ANTIHYPERTENSIVE MEDICATION, WHICH THEY WERE REQUESTED NOT TO CHANGE DURING THE STUDY. AFTER 12 WEEKS OF INTERVENTION, THE ASSESSMENTS WERE PERFORMED AGAIN. RESULTS: WE RECORDED NO EVIDENCE THAT YOGA ALTERED INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS OR METABOLIC RISK FACTORS IN OUR STUDY POPULATION. A TOTAL OF 49 PARTICIPANTS (59 %) MET THE CRITERIA FOR METABOLIC SYNDROME. CONCLUSION: THE YOGA INTERVENTIONS PERFORMED IN OUR STUDY DID NOT AFFECT INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS OR METABOLIC RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH CVD IN THE STUDY POPULATION OF PRIMARY CARE PATIENTS WITH HYPERTENSION. FURTHER RANDOMIZED TRIALS ARE NEEDED TO ELUCIDATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CVD RISK FACTORS IN THIS PARTICULAR GROUP.

13 1318  55 HEART RATE VARIABILITY IN CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN PATIENTS RANDOMIZED TO YOGA OR STANDARD CARE. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC PAIN CAN ALTER THE AUTONOMIC BALANCE WITH INCREASED SYMPATHETIC ACTIVITY REFLECTED IN ALTERED HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV). IT HAS BEEN PROPOSED THAT YOGA CAN BE USEFUL TO CORRECT THE AUTONOMIC IMBALANCE IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC PAIN WHO HAVE REDUCED HRV. METHODS AND DESIGNS: IN THE PRESENT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL 62 PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN ASSOCIATED WITH ALTERED ALIGNMENT OF INTERVERTEBRAL DISCS (AGED BETWEEN 20 AND 45 YEARS, 32 MALES) WERE RANDOMIZED TO 2 GROUPS. ONE GROUP RECEIVED YOGA FOR 3 MONTHS WHILE THE OTHER GROUP CARRIED OUT STANDARD MEDICAL CARE BASED ON THE PHYSICIAN'S ADVICE. THE DURATION WAS THE SAME, I.E., 3 MONTHS. THE HEART RATE VARIABILITY AND RATE OF RESPIRATION WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND AT THE END OF 3 MONTHS. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE BASELINE (PRE) VALUES BETWEEN GROUPS (P = 0.008) FOR RESPIRATION RATE WHICH WAS HIGHER IN THE YOGA GROUP. THE CHANGES REPORTED BELOW ARE PRE-POST COMPARISONS WITHIN EACH GROUP. THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.05; REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA, POST-HOC ANALYSES) DECREASE IN THE LF POWER OF HRV, RATE OF RESPIRATION AND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE HF POWER OF HRV AND IN THE PNN50. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA PRACTICE CAN SHIFT THE AUTONOMIC BALANCE TOWARDS VAGAL DOMINANCE IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN ASSOCIATED WITH ALTERED ALIGNMENT OF INTERVERTEBRAL DISCS.

14 1707  42 PATTERNS OF YOGA PRACTICE AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOLLOWING A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR ADULTS WITH OR AT RISK FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES. BACKGROUND: THE CURRENT STUDY DESCRIBED PATTERNS OF YOGA PRACTICE AND EXAMINED DIFFERENCES IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OVER TIME BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS WITH OR AT RISK FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES WHO COMPLETED AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION COMPARED WITH CONTROLS. METHODS: A LONGITUDINAL COMPARATIVE DESIGN MEASURED THE EFFECT OF A YOGA INTERVENTION ON YOGA PRACTICE AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, USING DATA AT BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION MONTHS 3, 6, AND 15. RESULTS: DISPARATE PATTERNS OF YOGA PRACTICE OCCURRED BETWEEN INTERVENTION AND CONTROL PARTICIPANTS OVER TIME, BUT THE SUBJECTIVE DEFINITION OF YOGA PRACTICE LIMITS INTERPRETATION. MULTILEVEL MODEL ESTIMATES INDICATED THAT TREATMENT GROUP DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE IN THE RATE OF CHANGE IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OVER THE STUDY PERIOD. WHILE AGE AND EDUCATION WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT INDIVIDUAL PREDICTORS, THE INCLUSION OF THESE VARIABLES IN THE MODEL DID IMPROVE FIT. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS INDICATE THAT AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OVER TIME. FURTHER RESEARCH IS NECESSARY TO EXPLORE THE INFLUENCE OF YOGA ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OUTCOMES AMONG INDIVIDUALS WITH OR AT RISK FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
15  936  39 EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA VERSUS EXERCISE FOR REDUCING FALLING RISK IN OLDER ADULTS: PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL INDICES. OUR PURPOSE IN THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA TO ADDRESS MULTIPLE RISK FACTORS OF FALLING IN ACTIVE AND LOW ACTIVE OLDER ADULTS. COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS (N = 35) OVER THE AGE OF 65 ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED IN EITHER A YOGA PROGRAM, AN EXERCISE PROGRAM, OR A NO-PROGRAM CONTROL. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED MEASURES ASSOCIATED WITH FALLING RISKS. PHYSICAL MEASURES INCLUDED LOWER BODY STRENGTH, STATIC BALANCE, AND LOWER BODY FLEXIBILITY. PSYCHOLOGICAL MEASURES INCLUDED PERCEIVED SELF-EFFICACY WITH RESPECT TO FALLS AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE. WE DETERMINED BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCES USING PLANNED COMPARISONS, EFFECT SIZE, CONFIDENCE INTERVALS, AND PROBABILITY OF SUPERIORITY. RESULTS OF PLANNED COMPARISONS AND PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE TESTING INDICATED THAT YOGA PARTICIPANTS SCORED HIGHER THAN THE EXERCISE AND CONTROL PARTICIPANTS ON BOTH RIGHT AND LEFT LOWER BODY FLEXIBILITY TESTS. YOGA PARTICIPANTS ALSO SCORED HIGHER THAN THE CONTROL PARTICIPANTS ON RIGHT LEG STATIC BALANCE, AND THE RIGHT AND LEFT LOWER BODY FLEXIBILITY TESTS. THE EXERCISE PARTICIPANTS SCORED HIGHER THAN YOGA PARTICIPANTS ON THE RAND-36 QUALITY OF LIFE SUBSCALES OF ENERGY/FATIGUE, PAIN, AND GENERAL HEALTH. THE PROBABILITY OF SUPERIORITY RESULTS INDICATED THAT THE NO-PROGRAM OLDER ADULT PARTICIPANTS WOULD BENEFIT BY ENROLLING IN THE YOGA RATHER THAN THE EXERCISE PROGRAM TO REDUCE PHYSICAL RISKS OF FALLING. THESE FINDINGS WERE DISCUSSED IN RELATION TO PROMOTING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PROGRAMS TO REDUCE RISKS OF FALLING, AND THE ROLES OF THE PROTOCOL, PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE, AND MEASURES EMPLOYED WHEN DETERMINING PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
16  243  54 A YOGA & EXERCISE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL FOR VASOMOTOR SYMPTOMS: EFFECTS ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY. OBJECTIVES: HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) REFLECTS THE INTEGRATION OF THE PARASYMPATHETIC NERVOUS SYSTEM WITH THE REST OF THE BODY. STUDIES ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND EXERCISE ON HRV HAVE BEEN MIXED BUT SUGGEST THAT EXERCISE INCREASES HRV. WE CONDUCTED A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECT OF YOGA AND EXERCISE ON HRV BASED ON A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL OF TREATMENTS FOR VASOMOTOR SYMPTOMS IN PERI/POST-MENOPAUSAL WOMEN. DESIGN: RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL OF BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS IN WOMEN WITH VASOMOTOR SYMPTOMS (N=335), 40-62 YEARS OLD FROM THREE CLINICAL STUDY SITES. INTERVENTIONS: 12-WEEKS OF A YOGA PROGRAM, DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR MID-LIFE WOMEN, OR A SUPERVISED AEROBIC EXERCISE-TRAINING PROGRAM WITH SPECIFIC INTENSITY AND ENERGY EXPENDITURE GOALS, COMPARED TO A USUAL ACTIVITY GROUP. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: TIME AND FREQUENCY DOMAIN HRV MEASURED AT BASELINE AND AT 12 WEEKS FOR 15MIN USING HOLTER MONITORS. RESULTS: WOMEN HAD A MEDIAN OF 7.6 VASOMOTOR SYMPTOMS PER 24H. TIME AND FREQUENCY DOMAIN HRV MEASURES DID NOT CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY IN EITHER OF THE INTERVENTION GROUPS COMPARED TO THE CHANGE IN THE USUAL ACTIVITY GROUP. HRV RESULTS DID NOT DIFFER WHEN THE ANALYSES WERE RESTRICTED TO POST-MENOPAUSAL WOMEN. CONCLUSIONS: ALTHOUGH YOGA AND EXERCISE HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE PARASYMPATHETIC-MEDIATED HRV IN OTHER POPULATIONS, NEITHER INTERVENTION INCREASED HRV IN MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN WITH VASOMOTOR SYMPTOMS. MIXED RESULTS IN PREVIOUS RESEARCH MAY BE DUE TO SAMPLE DIFFERENCES. YOGA AND EXERCISE LIKELY IMPROVE SHORT-TERM HEALTH IN MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN THROUGH MECHANISMS OTHER THAN HRV.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
17 1514  45 IS WEEKLY FREQUENCY OF YOGA PRACTICE SUFFICIENT? PHYSIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA AMONG HEALTHY NOVICE WOMEN. BENEFICIAL PHYSICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL HEALTH OUTCOMES OF YOGA PRACTICE ARE WELL-SUPPORTED BY EMPIRICAL DATA. HOWEVER, WHETHER WEEKLY FREQUENCY OF TRAINING IS SUFFICIENT TO EVOKE POSITIVE CHANGES, IS STILL AN OPEN QUESTION. THE PRESENT INTERVENTION STUDY INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF 10 WEEKLY SESSIONS OF BEGINNER LEVEL HATHA YOGA WITH RESPECT TO INDICATORS OF PHYSICAL FITNESS AND PHYSIOLOGICAL MARKERS. 82 YOUNG WOMEN (MEAN AGE OF 22.0 +/- 3.83 YEARS) PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY. THE YOGA GROUP (N = 49) ATTENDED A YOGA COURSE CONSISTING OF 10 SESSIONS (1.5 H EACH) ON A WEEKLY BASIS. THE CONTROL GROUP (N = 33) DID NOT RECEIVE ANY INTERVENTION. BMI, BODY FAT PERCENTAGE, BALANCE (ONE-LEG-STAND TEST WITH OPEN AND CLOSED EYES, FUNCTIONAL REACH TEST), FLEXIBILITY (SIDE BEND TEST, MODIFIED SIT AND REACH TEST) CORE MUSCLE STRENGTH (PLANK TEST) AS WELL AS RESTING HEART RATE (HR), AND HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) WERE ASSESSED 1 WEEK BEFORE AND AFTER THE COURSE. BOTH FREQUENTIST AND BAYESIAN ANALYSIS SHOWED AN IMPROVEMENT IN FLEXIBILITY AND BALANCE IN THE YOGA GROUP COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. THE YOGA GROUP SHOWED ALSO INCREASED CORE MUSCLE STRENGTH. NO CHANGES WITH RESPECT TO BMI, BODY FAT PERCENTAGE, RESTING HR AND HRV WERE FOUND. NINETY MINUTE BEGINNER LEVEL HATHA YOGA CLASSES WERE CHARACTERIZED BY 93.39 HR AND 195 KCAL ENERGY CONSUMPTION ON AVERAGE. THE PRESENT FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT WEEKLY SETTING OF A 10-SESSION LONG HATHA YOGA TRAINING LEADS TO IMPROVEMENTS IN BALANCE, FLEXIBILITY AND CORE MUSCLE STRENGTH AMONG HEALTHY YOUNG WOMEN. HOWEVER, FOR CHANGES IN BMI, BODY FAT PERCENTAGE, RESTING HR AND HRV LONGER, AND/OR MORE INTENSE INTERVENTIONS ARE NEEDED.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
18  247  59 A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES RISK REDUCTION: A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: TYPE 2 DIABETES IS A MAJOR HEALTH PROBLEM IN MANY COUNTRIES INCLUDING INDIA. YOGA MAY BE AN EFFECTIVE TYPE 2 DIABETES PREVENTION STRATEGY IN INDIA, PARTICULARLY GIVEN ITS CULTURAL FAMILIARITY. METHODS: THIS WAS A PARALLEL, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY TO COLLECT FEASIBILITY AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY DATA ON YOGA FOR DIABETES RISK FACTORS AMONG PEOPLE AT HIGH RISK OF DIABETES. PRIMARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED: CHANGES IN BMI, WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE, FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE, POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE, INSULIN, INSULIN RESISTANCE, BLOOD PRESSURE, AND CHOLESTEROL. WE ALSO LOOKED AT MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING INCLUDING CHANGES IN DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECT AND PERCEIVED STRESS. FORTY-ONE PARTICIPANTS WITH ELEVATED FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE IN BANGALORE, INDIA WERE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER YOGA (N = 21) OR A WALKING CONTROL (N = 20). PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO EITHER ATTEND YOGA CLASSES OR COMPLETE MONITORED WALKING 3-6 DAYS PER WEEK FOR EIGHT WEEKS. RANDOMIZATION AND ALLOCATION WAS PERFORMED USING COMPUTER-GENERATED RANDOM NUMBERS AND GROUP ASSIGNMENTS DELIVERED IN SEALED, OPAQUE ENVELOPES GENERATED BY OFF-SITE STUDY STAFF. DATA WERE ANALYZED BASED ON INTENTION TO TREAT. RESULTS: THIS STUDY WAS FEASIBLE IN TERMS OF RECRUITMENT, RETENTION AND ADHERENCE. IN ADDITION, YOGA PARTICIPANTS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER REDUCTIONS IN WEIGHT, WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE AND BMI VERSUS CONTROL (WEIGHT -0.8 +/- 2.1 VS. 1.4 +/- 3.6, P = 0.02; WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE -4.2 +/- 4.8 VS. 0.7 +/- 4.2, P < 0.01; BMI -0.2 +/- 0.8 VS. 0.6 +/- 1.6, P = 0.05). THERE WERE NO BETWEEN GROUP DIFFERENCES IN FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE, POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE, INSULIN RESISTANCE OR ANY OTHER FACTORS RELATED TO DIABETES RISK OR PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE, TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, NEGATIVE AFFECT AND PERCEIVED STRESS IN BOTH THE YOGA INTERVENTION AND WALKING CONTROL OVER THE COURSE OF THE STUDY. CONCLUSION: AMONG INDIANS WITH ELEVATED FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE, WE FOUND THAT PARTICIPATION IN AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION WAS FEASIBLE AND RESULTED IN GREATER WEIGHT LOSS AND REDUCTION IN WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE WHEN COMPARED TO A WALKING CONTROL. YOGA OFFERS A PROMISING LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION FOR DECREASING WEIGHT-RELATED TYPE 2 DIABETES RISK FACTORS AND POTENTIALLY INCREASING PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING.

19 2660  52 YOGA IN ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION. BACKGROUND: YOGA SEEMS TO EXERT ITS EFFECT AGAINST ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION MAINLY THROUGH THE ASSOCIATED BREATHING AND MEDITATION TECHNIQUES, AND LESS SO THROUGH YOGA POSTURES. THE GOAL OF THIS TRIAL WAS TO COMPARE THE BLOOD PRESSURE-LOWERING EFFECT OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS WITH AND WITHOUT YOGA POSTURES IN PATIENTS WITH ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION. METHODS: 75 PATIENTS TAKING MEDICATIONS FOR ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION (72% WOMEN, MEAN AGE 58.7 +/- 9.5 YEARS) WERE RANDOMIZED INTO THREE GROUPS: A YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP WITH YOGA POSTURES (25 PATIENTS, OF WHOM 5 DROPPED OUT OF THE TRIAL BEFORE ITS END), A YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP WITHOUT YOGA POSTURES (25 PATIENTS, 3 DROPOUTS), AND A WAIT LIST CONTROL GROUP (25 PATIENTS, ONE DROPOUT). THE INTERVENTIONS CONSISTED OF 90 MINUTES OF YOGA PRACTICE PER WEEK FOR TWELVE WEEKS. THE DATA COLLECTORS, WHO WERE BLINDED TO THE INTERVENTION RECEIVED, ASSESSED THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES "SYSTOLIC 24-HOUR BLOOD PRESSURE" AND "DIASTOLIC 24-HOUR BLOOD PRESSURE" BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION. IN THIS REPORT, WE ALSO PRESENT THE FINDINGS ON SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES, INCLUDING FOLLOW-UP DATA. RESULTS: AFTER THE INTERVENTION, THE SYSTOLIC 24-HOUR BLOOD PRESSURE IN THE YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP WITHOUT YOGA POSTURES WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN IN THE CONTROL GROUP (GROUP DIFFERENCE [DELTA]= -3.8 MMHG; [95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI): (-0.3; -7.4) P = 0.035]); IT WAS ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN IN THE YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP WITH YOGA POSTURES (DELTA = -3.2 MMHG; 95% CI: [-6.3; -0.8]; P = 0.045). DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURES DID NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY ACROSS GROUPS. NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS WERE ENCOUNTERED IN THE COURSE OF THE TRIAL. CONCLUSION: IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FINDINGS OF EARLIER STUDIES, WE FOUND THAT ONLY YOGA WITHOUT YOGA POSTURES INDUCED A SHORT-TERM LOWERING OF AMBULATORY SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE. YOGA IS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE IN PATIENTS TAKING MEDICATIONS FOR ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION AND THUS CAN BE RECOMMENDED AS AN ADDITIONAL TREATMENT OPTION FOR PERSONS IN THIS CATEGORY.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
20  686  62 EFFECT OF AN OFFICE WORKSITE-BASED YOGA PROGRAM ON HEART RATE VARIABILITY: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC WORK-RELATED STRESS IS A SIGNIFICANT AND INDEPENDENT RISK FACTOR FOR CARDIOVASCULAR AND METABOLIC DISEASES AND ASSOCIATED MORTALITY, PARTICULARLY WHEN COMPOUNDED BY A SEDENTARY WORK ENVIRONMENT. HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV) PROVIDES AN ESTIMATE OF PARASYMPATHETIC AND SYMPATHETIC AUTONOMIC CONTROL, AND CAN SERVE AS A MARKER OF PHYSIOLOGICAL STRESS. HATHA YOGA IS A PHYSICALLY DEMANDING PRACTICE THAT CAN HELP TO REDUCE STRESS; HOWEVER, TIME CONSTRAINTS INCURRED BY WORK AND FAMILY LIFE MAY LIMIT PARTICIPATION. THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT STUDY IS TO DETERMINE IF A 10-WEEK, WORKSITE-BASED YOGA PROGRAM DELIVERED DURING LUNCH HOUR CAN IMPROVE RESTING HRV AND RELATED PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS IN SEDENTARY OFFICE WORKERS. METHODS AND DESIGN: THIS IS A PARALLEL-ARM RCT THAT WILL COMPARE THE OUTCOMES OF PARTICIPANTS ASSIGNED TO THE EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT GROUP (YOGA) TO THOSE ASSIGNED TO A NO-TREATMENT CONTROL GROUP. PARTICIPANTS RANDOMIZED TO THE EXPERIMENTAL CONDITION WILL ENGAGE IN A 10-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM DELIVERED AT THEIR PLACE OF WORK. THE YOGA SESSIONS WILL BE GROUP-BASED, PRESCRIBED THREE TIMES PER WEEK DURING LUNCH HOUR, AND WILL BE LED BY AN EXPERIENCED YOGA INSTRUCTOR. THE PROGRAM WILL INVOLVE TEACHING BEGINNER STUDENTS SAFELY AND PROGRESSIVELY OVER 10 WEEKS A YOGA SEQUENCE THAT INCORPORATES ASANAS (POSES AND POSTURES), VINYASA (EXERCISES), PRANAYAMA (BREATHING CONTROL) AND MEDITATION. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME OF THIS STUDY IS THE HIGH FREQUENCY (HF) SPECTRAL POWER COMPONENT OF HRV (MEASURED IN ABSOLUTE UNITS; I.E. MS2), A MEASURE OF PARASYMPATHETIC AUTONOMIC CONTROL. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FREQUENCY AND TIME DOMAINS OF HRV, AND MEASURES OF PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH STATUS. MEASURES WILL BE COLLECTED PRIOR TO AND FOLLOWING THE INTERVENTION PERIOD, AND AT 6 MONTHS FOLLOW-UP TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF INTERVENTION WITHDRAWAL. DISCUSSION: THIS STUDY WILL DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF WORKSITE-BASED YOGA PRACTICE ON HRV AND PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH STATUS. THE FINDINGS MAY ASSIST IN IMPLEMENTING PRACTICAL INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS YOGA, INTO THE WORKPLACE TO MITIGATE STRESS, ENHANCE HEALTH STATUS AND REDUCE THE RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR AND METABOLIC DISEASES.

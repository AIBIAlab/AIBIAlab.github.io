3 2130  36 THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA TO PREVENT DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2: A PROTOCOL FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM) IS BECOMING A LEADING PROBLEM WORLDWIDE. EMERGING REPORTS REVEAL ALARMING EVIDENCE OF INCREASING PREVALENCE OF T2DM THAT HAS REACHED PANDEMIC LEVELS. DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT INCIDENCE, THERE ARE LIMITED RELIABLE DATA RESOURCES AND COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PEOPLE WHO ARE A PREDIABETIC OR HIGH RISK FOR DEVELOPING T2DM. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROTOCOL IS TO CONDUCT A FULL-SCALE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSES ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PEOPLE WHO ARE PREDIABETES OR HIGH RISK OF DEVELOPING T2DM. METHODS: THE ARTICLES ENROLLED IN THE STUDY WILL BE RETRIEVED FROM THE ONLINE DATABASES BETWEEN 2002 AND THE DATE THE SEARCHES ARE EXECUTED. THE SEARCHES WILL BE REPEATED JUST BEFORE THE FINAL ANALYSES AND FURTHER RELEVANT STUDIES FOR INCLUSION. WE WILL CONDUCT A BIBLIOGRAPHIC SEARCH IN DATABASES: MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, COCHRANE LIBRARY, EBSCO, AND INDMED USING KEYWORDS INCLUDING PREDIABETES STATE, HIGH RISK FOR DIABETES, METABOLIC SYNDROME, AND YOGA. A DEFINED SEARCH STRATEGY WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ALONG WITH SELECTION CRITERIA TO OBTAIN FULL-TEXT ARTICLES OF RELEVANT STUDIES. THIS STUDY PROTOCOL WAS PREPARED ACCORDING TO THE PREFERRED REPORTING ITEMS FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND META-ANALYSIS FOR PROTOCOLS 2015 GUIDELINES. THERE WILL BE NO LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL BE BASED ON PUBLISHED STUDIES AND PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ANONYMIZED DATA WITHOUT DIRECTLY INVOLVING HUMAN PARTICIPANTS AND THEREFORE REQUIRES NEITHER FORMAL HUMAN ETHICAL REVIEW NOR APPROVAL BY A HUMAN RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEE. WE PUBLISHED AN OUTLINE OF THE PROTOCOL IN THE INTERNATIONAL PROSPECTIVE REGISTER OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS (PROSPERO) IN 2018. WE PLAN TO DISSEMINATE THE FINDINGS OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS THROUGH PUBLICATION IN A PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL AND PRESENTATION AT RELEVANT CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS. IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE THE RESULTS OF THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WILL HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND PRACTICE. WE WILL PREPARE POLICYMAKER SUMMARY USING A VALIDATED FORMAT, DISSEMINATE THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA AND EMAIL DISCUSSION GROUPS.

4 1093  50 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON WELL-BEING AND HEALTHY AGEING: STUDY PROTOCOL FOR A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL (FITFORAGE). INTRODUCTION: DUE TO AGEING POPULATIONS WORLDWIDE, THE BURDEN OF DISABILITY IS INCREASING. IT IS THEREFORE IMPORTANT TO DEVELOP INTERVENTIONS THAT IMPROVE HEALTHY AGEING, REDUCE DISABILITY ONSET AND ENHANCE LIFE QUALITY. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY CAN PROMOTE HEALTHY AGEING AND HELP MAINTAIN INDEPENDENCE, YET MANY OLDER ADULTS ARE INACTIVE. YOGA IS A FORM OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THAT AIMS TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND MAY BE PARTICULARLY SUITABLE FOR OLDER ADULTS. RESEARCH INDICATES POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SEVERAL HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOMES; HOWEVER, EMPIRICAL STUDIES EXAMINING THE BENEFITS OF YOGA ON WELL-BEING AMONG THE ELDERLY REMAIN SCARCE. THIS STUDY PROTOCOL REPORTS THE METHODOLOGY FOR A 12-WEEK YOGA PROGRAMME AIMED TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING AMONG PHYSICALLY INACTIVE OLDER ADULTS. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: THREE GROUP PARALLEL, SINGLE-BLIND RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL. TWO COMPARISON GROUPS ARE INCLUDED: AEROBIC EXERCISE AND A NON-ACTIVE WAIT-LIST CONTROL. IN TOTAL, 180 PARTICIPANTS AGED 65-85 YEARS WILL BE RECRUITED. ASSESSMENTS WILL BE PERFORMED AT BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION (12-WEEK FOLLOW-UP). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME IS SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY/SEDENTARY BEHAVIOUR, MOBILITY/FALL RISK, COGNITION, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, MOOD, STRESS, PAIN, SLEEP QUALITY, SOCIAL SUPPORT AND CARDIOMETABOLIC RISK FACTORS. DATA WILL BE ANALYSED USING INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSES, WITH MIXED LINEAR MODELLING. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: THIS STUDY IS APPROVED BY THE ETHICAL REVIEW BOARD IN STOCKHOLM (2017/1862-31/2). ALL PARTICIPANTS MUST VOLUNTARILY AGREE TO PARTICIPATE AND ARE FREE TO WITHDRAW FROM THE STUDY AT ANY POINT. WRITTEN INFORMED CONSENT WILL BE OBTAINED FROM EACH PARTICIPANT PRIOR TO INCLUSION. RESULTS WILL BE AVAILABLE THROUGH RESEARCH ARTICLES AND CONFERENCES. A SUMMARY OF KEY RESULTS WILL BE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE THROUGH NEWSPAPER ARTICLES.

5 2861  55 YOGA-BASED EXERCISE TO PREVENT FALLS IN COMMUNITY-DWELLING PEOPLE AGED 60 YEARS AND OVER: STUDY PROTOCOL FOR THE SUCCESSFUL AGEING (SAGE) YOGA RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: FALLS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN OLDER AGE. BALANCE-SPECIFIC EXERCISE PREVENTS FALLS IN PEOPLE AGED 60+ YEARS. YOGA IS GROWING IN POPULARITY AND CAN PROVIDE A HIGH CHALLENGE TO BALANCE; HOWEVER, THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON FALLS HAS NOT BEEN EVALUATED. THIS TRIAL AIMS TO ESTABLISH THE EFFECT ON FALLS OF A YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAMME COMPARED WITH A YOGA RELAXATION PROGRAMME IN COMMUNITY-DWELLERS AGED 60+ YEARS. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: THIS RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL WILL INVOLVE 560 COMMUNITY-DWELLING PEOPLE AGED 60+ YEARS. PARTICIPANTS WILL BE RANDOMISED TO EITHER: (1) THE SUCCESSFUL AGEING (SAGE) YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAMME OR (2) A YOGA RELAXATION PROGRAMME. PRIMARY OUTCOME IS RATE OF FALLS IN THE 12 MONTHS POST RANDOMISATION. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDE MENTAL WELL-BEING, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, BALANCE SELF-CONFIDENCE, PHYSICAL FUNCTION, PAIN, GOAL ATTAINMENT AND SLEEP QUALITY AT 12 MONTHS AFTER RANDOMISATION. THE NUMBER OF FALLS PER PERSON-YEAR WILL BE ANALYSED USING NEGATIVE BINOMIAL REGRESSION MODELS TO ESTIMATE BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCE IN FALL RATES. GENERALISED LINEAR MODELS WILL ASSESS THE EFFECT OF GROUP ALLOCATION ON THE CONTINUOUSLY SCORED SECONDARY OUTCOMES, ADJUSTING FOR BASELINE SCORES. AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS WILL COMPARE THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS AND COST-UTILITY OF THE TWO YOGA PROGRAMMES.

6 1632  52 MIYOGA: A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF A MINDFULNESS MOVEMENT PROGRAMME BASED ON HATHA YOGA PRINCIPLES FOR CHILDREN WITH CEREBRAL PALSY: A STUDY PROTOCOL. INTRODUCTION: CEREBRAL PALSY (CP) IS THE MOST COMMON CHILDHOOD PHYSICAL DISABILITY, WITH LIFE-LONG IMPACTS FOR 1.77 IN 1000 CHILDREN. ALTHOUGH CP IS PRIMARILY A PHYSICAL DISABILITY, CHILDREN WITH CP HAVE AN INCREASED RISK OF EXPERIENCING COGNITIVE DIFFICULTIES, PARTICULARLY ATTENTION AND EXECUTIVE FUNCTION DEFICITS. IMPAIRMENT IN COGNITIVE ABILITIES CAN LEAD TO SUBSEQUENT IMPAIRMENT IN INDEPENDENT FUNCTIONING, EDUCATION, EMPLOYMENT AND INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS. THIS PAPER REPORTS THE PROTOCOL OF A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF A NOVEL FAMILY-CENTRED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION BASED ON MINDFULNESS AND HATHA YOGA PRINCIPLES (MIYOGA). MIYOGA AIMS TO ENHANCE CHILD AND PARENT OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN WITH CP. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: THE AIM IS TO RECRUIT 36 CHILD-PARENT DYADS (CHILDREN AGED 6-16 YEARS; BILATERAL OR UNILATERAL CP; GROSS MOTOR FUNCTION CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM I-III), WHO WILL BE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO TWO GROUPS: MIYOGA ANDWAITLISTT CONTROL. THE MIYOGA PROGRAMME WILL BE FACILITATED IN A GROUP FORMAT FOR 8 WEEKS. ASSESSMENTS WILL BE ADMINISTERED AT BASELINE, PRIOR TO MIYOGA, FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF MIYOGA, AND AT 6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP (RETENTION). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WILL BE THE CHILD'S SUSTAINED ATTENTIONAL ABILITY AS MEASURED BY THE CONNER'S CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE TEST II. OTHER OUTCOMES OF INTEREST FOR CHILDREN WITH CP CONSISTS OF ATTENTIONAL CONTROL, PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING, BEHAVIOURAL AND WELL-BEING. FOR PARENTS, THE OUTCOMES OF INTEREST ARE MINDFULNESS, PSYCHOLOGICAL FLEXIBILITY AND WELL-BEING. DATA WILL BE ANALYSED USING GENERAL LINEAR MODELS, SPECIFICALLY ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE AND ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: FULL ETHICAL APPROVAL FOR THIS STUDY HAS BEEN OBTAINED BY THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH QUEENSLAND HOSPITAL AND HEALTH SERVICE RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEE (HREC/12/QRCH/120) AND THE UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND (2012000993). IF MIYOGA IS PROVEN EFFECTIVE, ITS DISSEMINATION WOULD ASSIST CHILDREN WITH CP AND COMPLEMENT THEIR ONGOING THERAPY BY IMPROVING THE ABILITY OF THE CHILD TO PAY ATTENTION AT SCHOOL AND IN THERAPY, AND ALLEVIATING ENVIRONMENTALSTRESSORSS FOR BOTH THE CHILD AND HIS/HER PARENTS.

7 2389  46 YOGA AND AEROBIC DANCE FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT IN JUVENILE IDIOPATHIC ARTHRITIS: PROTOCOL FOR A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: JUVENILE IDIOPATHIC ARTHRITIS (JIA) IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON TYPES OF ARTHRITIS AMONG CHILDREN. ACCORDING TO JIA GUIDELINES FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (PA), STRUCTURED PA INTERVENTIONS LED TO IMPROVED HEALTH OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, MANY PA PROGRAMS, SUCH AS YOGA AND AEROBIC DANCE, HAVE NOT BEEN STUDIED IN THIS POPULATION DESPITE BEING POPULAR AMONG YOUTH. WEB-BASED PA PROGRAMS COULD PROVIDE PATIENTS WITH ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE INTERVENTIONS. OBJECTIVE: THE PRIMARY AIMS OF THE PROPOSED PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) ARE TO EXAMINE (1) THE FEASIBILITY OF CONDUCTING A FULL-SCALE RCT TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TWO POPULAR TYPES OF PA: A YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM AND AN AEROBIC DANCE TRAINING PROGRAM, IN FEMALE ADOLESCENTS (AGED 13-18 YEARS) WITH JIA COMPARED WITH AN ELECTRONIC PAMPHLET CONTROL GROUP; AND (2) THE ACCEPTABILITY OF THESE INTERVENTIONS. METHODS: A THREE-ARM PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED OPEN-LABEL STUDY WITH A PARALLEL GROUP DESIGN WILL BE USED. A TOTAL OF 25 FEMALE ADOLESCENTS WITH JIA WHO HAVE PAIN WILL BE RANDOMIZED IN A RATIO OF 2:2:1 TO ONE OF THE 3 GROUPS: (1) ONLINE YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM (GROUP A: N=10); (2) ONLINE AEROBIC DANCE TRAINING PROGRAM (GROUP B: N=10); AND (3) ELECTRONIC PAMPHLET CONTROL GROUP (GROUP C: N=5). PARTICIPANTS IN GROUPS A AND B WILL COMPLETE 3 INDIVIDUAL 1-HOUR SESSIONS PER WEEK USING ONLINE EXERCISE VIDEOS, AS WELL AS A 1-HOUR VIRTUAL GROUP SESSION PER WEEK USING A VIDEOCONFERENCING PLATFORM FOR 12 WEEKS. PARTICIPANTS FROM ALL GROUPS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO AN ELECTRONIC EDUCATIONAL PAMPHLET ON PA FOR ARTHRITIS DEVELOPED BY THE ARTHRITIS SOCIETY. ALL PARTICIPANTS WILL ALSO TAKE PART IN WEEKLY ONLINE CONSULTATIONS WITH A RESEARCH COORDINATOR AND DISCUSSIONS ON FACEBOOK WITH PARTICIPANTS FROM THEIR OWN GROUP. FEASIBILITY (IE, RECRUITMENT RATE, SELF-REPORTED ADHERENCE TO THE INTERVENTIONS, DROPOUT RATES, AND PERCENTAGE OF MISSING DATA), ACCEPTABILITY, AND USABILITY OF FACEBOOK AND THE VIDEOCONFERENCING PLATFORM WILL BE ASSESSED AT THE END OF THE PROGRAM. PAIN INTENSITY, PARTICIPATION IN GENERAL PA, MORNING STIFFNESS, FUNCTIONAL STATUS, FATIGUE, SELF-EFFICACY, PATIENT GLOBAL ASSESSMENT, DISEASE ACTIVITY, AND ADVERSE EVENTS WILL BE ASSESSED USING SELF-ADMINISTERED ELECTRONIC SURVEYS AT BASELINE AND THEN WEEKLY UNTIL THE END OF THE 12-WEEK PROGRAM. RESULTS: THIS PILOT RCT HAS BEEN FUNDED BY THE ARTHRITIS HEALTH PROFESSIONS ASSOCIATION. THIS PROTOCOL WAS APPROVED BY THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF EASTERN ONTARIO RESEARCH ETHICS BOARD (#17/08X). AS OF MAY 11, 2020, RECRUITMENT AND DATA COLLECTION HAVE NOT STARTED. CONCLUSIONS: TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AND AEROBIC DANCE AS PAIN MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS FOR FEMALE ADOLESCENTS WITH JIA. THE USE OF ONLINE PROGRAMS TO DISSEMINATE THESE 2 PA INTERVENTIONS MAY FACILITATE ACCESS TO ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF PAIN MANAGEMENT. THIS STUDY CAN LEAD TO A FULL-SCALE RCT.

8 1345  42 HYPERTENSION ANALYSIS OF STRESS REDUCTION USING MINDFULNESS MEDITATION AND YOGA (THE HARMONY STUDY): STUDY PROTOCOL OF A RANDOMISED CONTROL TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: HYPERTENSION (HTN) IS A LEADING RISK FACTOR FOR PREVENTABLE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, WITH OVER ONE IN FIVE ADULTS AFFECTED WORLDWIDE. LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION IS A KEY STRATEGY FOR THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF HTN. STRESS HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER CARDIOVASCULAR RISK, AND STRESS MANAGEMENT IS A RECOMMENDED INTERVENTION FOR HYPERTENSIVES. STRESS REDUCTION THROUGH RELAXATION THERAPIES HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE AN EFFECT ON HUMAN PHYSIOLOGY, INCLUDING LOWERING BLOOD PRESSURE (BP). HOWEVER, INDIVIDUALISED BEHAVIOURAL INTERVENTIONS ARE RESOURCE INTENSIVE, AND GROUP STRESS MANAGEMENT APPROACHES HAVE NOT BEEN VALIDATED FOR REDUCING HTN. THE HARMONY STUDY IS A PILOT RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL DESIGNED TO DETERMINE IF MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION (MBSR), A STANDARDISED GROUP THERAPY, IS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR LOWERING BP IN STAGE 1 UNMEDICATED HYPERTENSIVES. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: MEN AND WOMEN UNMEDICATED FOR HTN WITH MEAN DAYTIME AMBULATORY BLOOD PRESSURE (ABP) >/=135/85 MM HG OR 24 H ABP >/=130/80 MM HG ARE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. SUBJECTS ARE RANDOMISED TO RECEIVE MBSR IMMEDIATELY OR AFTER A WAIT-LIST CONTROL PERIOD. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE IS MEAN AWAKE AND 24 H ABP. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF THE HARMONY STUDY IS TO COMPARE ABP BETWEEN THE TREATMENT AND WAIT-LIST CONTROL ARM AT THE 12-WEEK PRIMARY ASSESSMENT PERIOD. RESULTS FROM THIS STUDY WILL DETERMINE IF MBSR IS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR LOWERING BP IN EARLY UNMEDICATED HYPERTENSIVES. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: THIS RESEARCH PROJECT WAS APPROVED BY THE SUNNYBROOK RESEARCH ETHICS BOARD AND THE UNIVERSITY HEALTH NETWORK RESEARCH ETHICS BOARD (TORONTO, CANADA). PLANNED ANALYSES ARE IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF THE DECLARATION OF HELSINKI. DATA COLLECTION WILL BE COMPLETED BY EARLY SPRING 2012. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY ANALYSIS WILL COMMENCE IMMEDIATELY AFTER DATA MONITORING IS COMPLETED; DISSEMINATION PLANS INCLUDE PREPARING PUBLICATIONS FOR SUBMISSION DURING THE SUMMER OF 2012.

11  619  30 DEVELOPMENT OF THE CLARIFY (CHECKLIST STANDARDISING THE REPORTING OF INTERVENTIONS FOR YOGA) GUIDELINES: A DELPHI STUDY. BACKGROUND: THE USE OF YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC MODALITY IS INCREASING; HOWEVER, A LACK OF TRANSPARENT INTERVENTION REPORTING IS RESTRICTING THE DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF YOGA RESEARCH INTO CLINICAL AND COMMUNITY PRACTICE. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DEVELOP A YOGA-SPECIFIC REPORTING GUIDELINE AS AN EXTENSION TO EXISTING REPORTING GUIDELINES FOR RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS, OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES AND CASE REPORTS. METHODS: RECOGNISED INTERNATIONAL STAKEHOLDERS IN THE DESIGN AND CONDUCT OF YOGA RESEARCH WERE INVITED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE ELECTRONIC DELPHI SURVEY. A FOUR-ROUND DELPHI WAS CONDUCTED, WHEREBY PANELLISTS RATED SELECTED ITEMS FOR THEIR IMPORTANCE IN THE INCLUSION OF YOGA REPORTING GUIDELINES, ACCORDING TO A 5-STEP LIKERT SCALE. A PRIORI CONSENSUS FOR ITEM INCLUSION WAS AGREEMENT OF ITEMS AS 'VERY IMPORTANT' OR 'EXTREMELY IMPORTANT' BY >/=80% OF PANELLISTS. NON-CONSENSUS ITEMS WERE FORWARDED TO SUBSEQUENT ROUNDS FOR RE-RATING. RESULTS: 53 EXPERTS IN YOGA RESEARCH FROM 11 COUNTRIES, PRIMARILY IDENTIFYING AS RESEARCHERS (50%), ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS (18.8%) AND YOGA PROFESSIONALS (12.5%), CONSENTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DELPHI. OF THESE, 48 COMPLETED ROUND 1 (91%), 43 COMPLETED ROUND 2 (81%), 39 COMPLETED ROUND 3 (74%) AND 32 COMPLETED ROUND 4 (60%). PANELLISTS REACHED CONSENSUS FOR INCLUSION ON 21 ITEMS, GROUPED UNDER 10 DOMAINS REFLECTIVE OF MORE GENERIC INTERVENTION-BASED GUIDELINES. CONCLUSIONS: THE CONSENSUS-BASED 21-ITEM CLARIFY (CHECKLIST STANDARDISING THE REPORTING OF INTERVENTIONS FOR YOGA) CHECKLIST PROVIDES A MINIMUM REPORTING TEMPLATE FOR RESEARCHERS ACROSS A RANGE OF METHODOLOGY DESIGNS. USE OF THESE YOGA-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CLARIFY EXPLANATION AND ELABORATION GUIDELINES, WILL STANDARDISE THE MINIMUM LEVEL OF DETAIL REQUIRED FOR TRANSPARENT YOGA INTERVENTION, FACILITATING THE REPLICATION, DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF YOGA RESEARCH. ONGOING RESEARCH WILL ASSESS THE UPTAKE AND IMPACT OF CLARIFY, TO ENSURE THESE GUIDELINES RETAIN THEIR RELEVANCE TO THE INTERNATIONALLY GROWING FIELD OF YOGA RESEARCH.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
12 2831  38 YOGA VS. PHYSICAL THERAPY VS. EDUCATION FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN IN PREDOMINANTLY MINORITY POPULATIONS: STUDY PROTOCOL FOR A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN CAUSES SUBSTANTIAL MORBIDITY AND COST TO SOCIETY WHILE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTING LOW-INCOME AND MINORITY ADULTS. SEVERAL RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS SHOW YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE TREATMENT. HOWEVER, THE COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AND PHYSICAL THERAPY, A COMMON MAINSTREAM TREATMENT FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN, IS UNKNOWN. METHODS/DESIGN: THIS IS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL FOR 320 PREDOMINANTLY LOW-INCOME MINORITY ADULTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN, COMPARING YOGA, PHYSICAL THERAPY, AND EDUCATION. INCLUSION CRITERIA ARE ADULTS 18-64 YEARS OLD WITH NON-SPECIFIC LOW BACK PAIN LASTING >/= 12 WEEKS AND A SELF-REPORTED AVERAGE PAIN INTENSITY OF >/= 4 ON A 0-10 SCALE. RECRUITMENT TAKES PLACE AT BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER, AN URBAN ACADEMIC SAFETY-NET HOSPITAL AND SEVEN FEDERALLY QUALIFIED COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS LOCATED IN DIVERSE NEIGHBORHOODS. THE 52-WEEK STUDY HAS AN INITIAL 12-WEEK TREATMENT PHASE WHERE PARTICIPANTS ARE RANDOMIZED IN A 2:2:1 RATIO INTO I) A STANDARDIZED WEEKLY HATHA YOGA CLASS SUPPLEMENTED BY HOME PRACTICE; II) A STANDARDIZED EVIDENCE-BASED EXERCISE THERAPY PROTOCOL ADAPTED FROM THE TREATMENT BASED CLASSIFICATION METHOD, INDIVIDUALLY DELIVERED BY A PHYSICAL THERAPIST AND SUPPLEMENTED BY HOME PRACTICE; AND III) EDUCATION DELIVERED THROUGH A SELF-CARE BOOK. CO-PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES ARE 12-WEEK PAIN INTENSITY MEASURED ON AN 11-POINT NUMERICAL RATING SCALE AND BACK-SPECIFIC FUNCTION MEASURED USING THE MODIFIED ROLAND MORRIS DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE. IN THE SUBSEQUENT 40-WEEK MAINTENANCE PHASE, YOGA PARTICIPANTS ARE RE-RANDOMIZED IN A 1:1 RATIO TO EITHER STRUCTURED MAINTENANCE YOGA CLASSES OR HOME PRACTICE ONLY. PHYSICAL THERAPY PARTICIPANTS ARE SIMILARLY RE-RANDOMIZED TO EITHER FIVE BOOSTER SESSIONS OR HOME PRACTICE ONLY. EDUCATION PARTICIPANTS CONTINUE TO FOLLOW RECOMMENDATIONS OF EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS. WE WILL ALSO ASSESS COST EFFECTIVENESS FROM THE PERSPECTIVES OF THE INDIVIDUAL, INSURERS, AND SOCIETY USING CLAIMS DATABASES, ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS, SELF-REPORT COST DATA, AND STUDY RECORDS. QUALITATIVE DATA FROM INTERVIEWS WILL ADD SUBJECTIVE DETAIL TO COMPLEMENT QUANTITATIVE DATA.

13  258  44 ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF A 12-WEEK YOGA VS. EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS): STUDY PROTOCOL FOR A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: RESTLESS LEGS SYNDROME (RLS) IS A COMMON AND BURDENSOME SLEEP DISORDER ASSOCIATED WITH PROFOUND IMPAIRMENT OF HEALTH, WELL-BEING, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. UNFORTUNATELY, THE MEDICATIONS USED FOR RLS MANAGEMENT CARRY RISK OF SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS, INCLUDING AUGMENTATION OF SYMPTOMS. YOGA, AN ANCIENT MIND-BODY DISCIPLINE DESIGNED TO PROMOTE PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, AND MENTAL WELL-BEING, MAY OFFER A VIABLE, LOW-RISK NEW TREATMENT. THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVES OF THIS PILOT, PARALLEL-ARM, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) ARE TO ASSESS THE ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF A 12-WEEK YOGA VS. EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF RLS. METHODS: FORTY-FOUR ADULTS WITH CONFIRMED MODERATE TO SEVERE RLS WILL BE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED TO A 12-WEEK YOGA (N = 22) OR STANDARDIZED EDUCATIONAL FILM PROGRAM (N = 22). YOGA GROUP PARTICIPANTS WILL ATTEND TWO 75-MIN IYENGAR YOGA CLASSES PER WEEK FOR THE FIRST 4 WEEKS, THEN ONE 75-MIN CLASS PER WEEK FOR THE REMAINING 8 WEEKS, AND WILL COMPLETE A 30-MIN HOMEWORK ROUTINE ON NON-CLASS DAYS. EDUCATIONAL FILM GROUP PARTICIPANTS WILL ATTEND ONE 75-MIN CLASS PER WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS AND COMPLETE A DAILY RLS TREATMENT LOG; CLASSES WILL INCLUDE INFORMATION ON: RLS MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING SLEEP HYGIENE PRACTICES; OTHER SLEEP DISORDERS; AND COMPLEMENTARY THERAPIES LIKELY TO BE OF INTEREST TO THOSE PARTICIPATING IN A YOGA AND SLEEP EDUCATION STUDY. YOGA AND TREATMENT LOGS WILL BE COLLECTED WEEKLY. FEASIBILITY OUTCOMES WILL INCLUDE RECRUITMENT, ENROLLMENT, AND RANDOMIZATION RATES, RETENTION, ADHERENCE, AND PROGRAM SATISFACTION. PROGRAM EVALUATION AND YOGA-DOSING QUESTIONNAIRES WILL BE COLLECTED AT WEEK 12; DATA ON EXPLORATORY OUTCOMES (E.G., RLS SYMPTOM SEVERITY (IRLS), SLEEP QUALITY (PSQI), MOOD (POMS, PSS), AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (SF-36)) WILL BE GATHERED AT BASELINE AND WEEK 12. DISCUSSION: THIS STUDY WILL LAY THE ESSENTIAL GROUNDWORK FOR A PLANNED LARGER RCT TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF A YOGA PROGRAM FOR REDUCING SYMPTOMS AND ASSOCIATED BURDEN OF RLS. IF THE FINDINGS OF THE CURRENT TRIAL AND THE SUBSEQUENT LARGER RCTS ARE POSITIVE, THIS STUDY WILL ALSO HELP SUPPORT A NEW APPROACH TO CLINICAL TREATMENT OF THIS CHALLENGING DISORDER, HELP FOSTER IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF RLS ETIOLOGY, AND ULTIMATELY CONTRIBUTE TO REDUCING THE INDIVIDUAL, SOCIETAL, AND ECONOMIC BURDEN ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CONDITION.

14 2764  46 YOGA PROGRAMME FOR TYPE-2 DIABETES PREVENTION (YOGA-DP) AMONG HIGH RISK PEOPLE IN INDIA: A MULTICENTRE FEASIBILITY RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL PROTOCOL. INTRODUCTION: A HUGE POPULATION IN INDIA IS AT HIGH RISK OF TYPE-2 DIABETES (T2DM). PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND A HEALTHY DIET (HEALTHY LIFESTYLE) IMPROVE BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS IN PEOPLE AT HIGH RISK OF T2DM. HOWEVER, AN UNHEALTHY LIFESTYLE IS COMMON AMONG INDIANS. YOGA COVERS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND A HEALTHY DIET AND CAN HELP TO PREVENT T2DM. THE RESEARCH QUESTION TO BE ADDRESSED BY THE MAIN RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) IS WHETHER A YOGA PROGRAMME FOR T2DM PREVENTION (YOGA-DP) IS EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING T2DM AMONG HIGH RISK PEOPLE IN INDIA AS COMPARED WITH ENHANCED STANDARD CARE. IN THIS CURRENT STUDY, WE ARE DETERMINING THE FEASIBILITY OF UNDERTAKING THE MAIN RCT. INTERVENTION: YOGA-DP IS A STRUCTURED LIFESTYLE EDUCATION AND EXERCISE PROGRAMME. THE EXERCISE PART IS BASED ON YOGA AND INCLUDES SHITHILIKARANA VYAYAMA (LOOSENING EXERCISES), SURYA NAMASKAR (SUN SALUTATION EXERCISES), ASANA (YOGIC POSES), PRANAYAMA (BREATHING PRACTICES) AND DHYANA (MEDITATION) AND RELAXATION PRACTICES. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: THIS IS A MULTICENTRE, TWO-ARM, PARALLEL-GROUP, FEASIBILITY RCT WITH BLINDED OUTCOME ASSESSMENT AND INTEGRATED MIXED-METHODS PROCESS EVALUATION. ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS SHOULD BE AGED 18-74 YEARS, AT HIGH RISK OF T2DM (FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE LEVEL 5.6-6.9 MMOL/L) AND SAFE TO PARTICIPATE IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES. AT LEAST 64 PARTICIPANTS WILL BE RANDOMISED TO INTERVENTION OR CONTROL GROUP WITH FINAL FOLLOW-UP AT 6 MONTHS. IMPORTANT PARAMETERS, NEEDED TO DESIGN THE MAIN RCT, WILL BE ESTIMATED, SUCH AS SD OF THE OUTCOME MEASURE (FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE LEVEL AT 6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP), RECRUITMENT, INTERVENTION ADHERENCE, FOLLOW-UP, POTENTIAL CONTAMINATION AND TIME NEEDED TO CONDUCT THE STUDY. SEMISTRUCTURED QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WILL BE CONDUCTED WITH UP TO 20-30 PARTICIPANTS, A SAMPLE OF THOSE DECLINING TO PARTICIPATE, FOUR YOGA-DP INSTRUCTORS AND AROUND EIGHT STUDY STAFF TO EXPLORE THEIR PERCEPTIONS AND EXPERIENCES OF TAKING PART IN THE STUDY AND OF THE INTERVENTION, REASONS BEHIND NON-PARTICIPATION, EXPERIENCES OF DELIVERING THE INTERVENTION AND RUNNING THE STUDY, RESPECTIVELY. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: ETHICS APPROVAL HAS BEEN OBTAINED FROM THE FOLLOWING RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEES: FACULTY OF MEDICINE AND HEALTH SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF NOTTINGHAM (UK); CENTRE FOR CHRONIC DISEASE CONTROL (CCDC, INDIA); BAPU NATURE CURE HOSPITAL AND YOGASHRAM (BNCHY, INDIA) AND SWAMI VIVEKANANDA YOGA ANUSANDHANA SAMSTHANA (S-VYASA, INDIA). THE RESULTS WILL BE WIDELY DISSEMINATED AMONG KEY STAKEHOLDERS THROUGH VARIOUS AVENUES.

16  888  51 EFFECT OF YOGA VERSUS LIGHT EXERCISE TO IMPROVE WELL-BEING AND PROMOTE HEALTHY AGING AMONG OLDER ADULTS IN CENTRAL INDIA: A STUDY PROTOCOL FOR A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: AGING IS A NATURAL PROCESS ASSOCIATED WITH MANY FUNCTIONAL AND STRUCTURAL CHANGES. THESE CHANGES MAY INCLUDE IMPAIRED SELF-REGULATION, CHANGES IN TISSUES AND ORGANS. AGING ALSO AFFECTS MOOD, PHYSICAL STATUS AND SOCIAL ACTIVITY. THERE ARE ADVERSE CHANGES IN COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR, PERCEIVED SENSATION AND THINKING PROCESSES. REGULAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY CAN ALLEVIATE MANY HEALTH PROBLEMS; YET, MANY OLDER ADULTS ARE INACTIVE. YOGA IS ONE OF THE SCIENTIFIC AND POPULAR LIFESTYLE PRACTICE CONSIDERED AS THE INTEGRATION OF MIND, BODY AND SOUL. RESULTS OF PREVIOUS STUDIES REPORTED POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON MULTIPLE HEALTH OUTCOMES IN ELDERLY. HOWEVER, THERE IS SCARCITY OF SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION WHERE YOGA'S EFFECT IS EXAMINED ON OVER WELL-BEING AND ON MULTIPLE HEALTH OUTCOMES SIMULTANEOUSLY IN ELDERLY. THIS PROTOCOL DESCRIBES METHODS FOR A 12-WEEK YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION EXPLORING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON WELL-BEING IN PHYSICALLY INACTIVE ELDERLY LIVING IN COMMUNITY. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: THIS TWO GROUP PARALLEL SINGLE BLIND RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL THAT WILL BE CONDUCTED AT A DESIGNATED FACILITY OF R.D. GARDI MEDICAL COLLEGE, UJJAIN, MADHYA PRADESH, CENTRAL INDIA. A 12-WEEK 60-MIN YOGA INTERVENTION THREE TIMES WEEKLY IS DESIGNED. COMPARISON GROUP PARTICIPANTS WILL UNDERGO A 60-MIN PROGRAM COMPRISING LIGHT EXERCISE FOCUSING ON CONVENTIONAL STRETCHING TO IMPROVE MOBILITY. AFTER SCREENING, 144 PARTICIPANTS AGED 60-80 YEARS WILL BE RECRUITED. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME IS SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING. SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDE MOBILITY, FALL RISK, COGNITION, ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, MOOD AND STRESS, SLEEP QUALITY, PAIN, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY/SEDENTARY BEHAVIOR AND CARDIO-METABOLIC RISK FACTORS. ASSESSMENTS WILL BE CONDUCTED AT BASELINE (0 WEEK), AFTER THE INTERVENTION (12+1 WEEK) AND AT FOLLOW-UP (36+1 WEEK). INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSES WITH MIXED LINEAR MODELING WILL BE APPLIED. DISCUSSION: THROUGH THIS TRIAL, WE AIM TO DETERMINE WHETHER ELDERLY PEOPLE IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP PRACTICING YOGA SHOW MORE FAVORABLE PRIMARY (WELL-BEING) AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES THAN THOSE IN THE LIGHT EXERCISE FOCUSING ON CONVENTIONAL STRETCHING GROUP. WE ASSUME THAT YOGA MAY BE PRACTICED TO MAINTAIN HEALTH, REDUCE PARTICULAR SYMPTOMS COMMONLY ASSOCIATED WITH SKELETAL PAIN, ASSIST IN PAIN RELIEF AND ENHANCE WELL-BEING. WE ANTICIPATE THAT PRACTICING YOGA WILL IMPROVE WELL-BEING AND MENTAL HEALTH AND MAY LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN DEPRESSION, PAIN AND SLEEP QUALITY.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: THIS STUDY IS APPROVED BY THE INSTITUTIONAL ETHICS COMMITTEE OF R.D. GARDI MEDICAL COLLEGE, UJJAIN, IEC REF NO. 09/2018. ALL PARTICIPANTS WOULD BE PROVIDED WITH WRITTEN AND VERBAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT AND WOULD BE FREE TO WITHDRAW FROM THE STUDY AT ANY TIME. REFUSAL TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY WOULD NOT HAVE ANY NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES. CONFIDENTIALITY OF THE INFORMATION OF EACH PARTICIPANT WOULD BE ENSURED. KNOWLEDGE OBTAINED WOULD BE DISSEMINATED TO STAKEHOLDERS THROUGH WORKSHOPS, MEETINGS AND RELEVANT SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCES. TRIAL REGISTRATION: THE TRIAL IS PROSPECTIVELY REGISTERED WITH THE INDIAN COUNCIL OF MEDICAL RESEARCH TRIAL REGISTRY CTRI/2018/07/015051.	2019	
                                                     
17 2763  29 YOGA PROGRAM FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES PREVENTION (YOGA-DP) AMONG HIGH-RISK PEOPLE: QUALITATIVE STUDY TO EXPLORE REASONS FOR NON-PARTICIPATION IN A FEASIBILITY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IN INDIA. BACKGROUND: YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN PREVENTING TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM). WE DEVELOPED A YOGA PROGRAM FOR T2DM PREVENTION (YOGA-DP) AMONG HIGH-RISK PEOPLE AND CONDUCTED A FEASIBILITY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) IN INDIA. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO IDENTIFY AND EXPLORE WHY POTENTIAL PARTICIPANTS DECLINED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FEASIBILITY RCT. METHODS: AN EXPLORATORY QUALITATIVE STUDY, USING SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS, WAS CONDUCTED AT A YOGA CENTER IN NEW DELHI, INDIA. FOURTEEN PEOPLE (10 WOMEN AND FOUR MEN) WHO DECLINED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FEASIBILITY RCT WERE INTERVIEWED, AND 13 OF THEM COMPLETED THE NON-PARTICIPANT QUESTIONNAIRE, WHICH CAPTURED THEIR SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHICS, DIETS, PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES, AND REASONS FOR DECLINING. RESULTS: THREE TYPES OF BARRIERS WERE IDENTIFIED AND EXPLORED WHICH PREVENTED PARTICIPATION IN THE FEASIBILITY RCT: (1) PERSONAL BARRIERS, SUCH AS LACK OF TIME, PERCEIVED SUFFICIENCY OF KNOWLEDGE, PREFERENCES ABOUT SELF-MANAGEMENT OF HEALTH, AND TRUST IN OTHER TRADITIONAL AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES; (2) CONTEXTUAL BARRIERS, SUCH AS SOCIAL INFLUENCES AND LACK OF AWARENESS ABOUT PREVENTIVE CARE; AND (3) STUDY-RELATED BARRIERS, SUCH AS LACK OF STUDY INFORMATION, POOR ACCESSIBILITY TO THE YOGA SITE, AND LACK OF TRUST IN THE STUDY METHODS AND INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: WE IDENTIFIED AND EXPLORED PERSONAL, CONTEXTUAL, AND STUDY-RELATED BARRIERS TO PARTICIPATION IN A FEASIBILITY RCT IN INDIA. THE FINDINGS WILL HELP TO ADDRESS RECRUITMENT CHALLENGES IN FUTURE YOGA AND OTHER RCTS.

18 2035  24 TELE-YOGA FOR CHRONIC PAIN: CURRENT STATUS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS. PAIN IS A PERVASIVE, DEBILITATING DISORDER THAT IS RESISTANT TO LONG-TERM PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS. ALTHOUGH PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPIES SUCH AS COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY DEMONSTRATE MODERATE EFFICACY, MANY INDIVIDUALS CONTINUE TO HAVE ONGOING DIFFICULTIES FOLLOWING TREATMENT. THERE IS A CURRENT TREND TO ESTABLISH COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE HEALTH INTERVENTIONS FOR CHRONIC PAIN, FOR WHICH YOGA HAS BEEN FOUND TO HAVE EXCITING POTENTIAL. NEVERTHELESS, AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION WITHIN THE FIELD IS ACCESSIBILITY TO ADEQUATE CARE.

19 2829  40 YOGA VERSUS STANDARD CARE FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS AN ANCIENT SPIRITUAL PRACTICE THAT ORIGINATED IN INDIA AND IS CURRENTLY ACCEPTED IN THE WESTERN WORLD AS A FORM OF RELAXATION AND EXERCISE. IT HAS BEEN OF INTEREST FOR PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA TO DETERMINE ITS EFFICACY AS AN ADJUNCT TO STANDARD-CARE TREATMENT. OBJECTIVES: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA VERSUS STANDARD CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA. SEARCH METHODS: WE SEARCHED THE COCHRANE SCHIZOPHRENIA GROUP TRIALS REGISTER (NOVEMBER 2012 AND JANUARY 29, 2015), WHICH IS BASED ON REGULAR SEARCHES OF MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE, CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, PSYCINFO, AND REGISTRIES OF CLINICAL TRIALS. WE SEARCHED THE REFERENCES OF ALL INCLUDED STUDIES. THERE WERE NO LANGUAGE, DATE, DOCUMENT TYPE, OR PUBLICATION STATUS LIMITATIONS FOR INCLUSION OF RECORDS IN THE REGISTER. SELECTION CRITERIA: ALL RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) INCLUDING PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA COMPARING YOGA TO STANDARD-CARE CONTROL. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: THE REVIEW TEAM INDEPENDENTLY SELECTED STUDIES, QUALITY RATED THESE, AND EXTRACTED DATA. FOR BINARY OUTCOMES, WE CALCULATED RISK RATIO (RR) AND ITS 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI), ON AN INTENTION-TO-TREAT BASIS. FOR CONTINUOUS DATA, WE ESTIMATED THE MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) BETWEEN GROUPS AND ITS 95% CI. WE EMPLOYED MIXED-EFFECT AND FIXED-EFFECT MODELS FOR ANALYSES. WE EXAMINED DATA FOR HETEROGENEITY (I(2) TECHNIQUE), ASSESSED RISK OF BIAS FOR INCLUDED STUDIES, AND CREATED 'SUMMARY OF FINDINGS' TABLES USING GRADE (GRADING OF RECOMMENDATIONS ASSESSMENT, DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION). MAIN RESULTS: WE INCLUDED EIGHT STUDIES IN THE REVIEW. ALL OUTCOMES WERE SHORT TERM (LESS THAN SIX MONTHS). THERE WERE CLEAR DIFFERENCES IN A NUMBER OF OUTCOMES IN FAVOUR OF THE YOGA GROUP, ALTHOUGH THESE WERE BASED ON ONE STUDY EACH, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF LEAVING THE STUDY EARLY. THESE INCLUDED MENTAL STATE (IMPROVEMENT IN POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE SYNDROME SCALE, 1 RCT, N = 83, RR 0.70 CI 0.55 TO 0.88, MEDIUM-QUALITY EVIDENCE), SOCIAL FUNCTIONING (IMPROVEMENT IN SOCIAL OCCUPATIONAL FUNCTIONING SCALE, 1 RCT, N = 83, RR 0.88 CI 0.77 TO 1, MEDIUM-QUALITY EVIDENCE), QUALITY OF LIFE (AVERAGE CHANGE 36-ITEM SHORT FORM SURVEY (SF-36) QUALITY-OF-LIFE SUBSCALE, 1 RCT, N = 60, MD 15.50, 95% CI 4.27 TO 26.73, LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE), AND LEAVING THE STUDY EARLY (8 RCTS, N = 457, RR 0.91 CI 0.6 TO 1.37, MEDIUM-QUALITY EVIDENCE). FOR THE OUTCOME OF PHYSICAL HEALTH, THERE WAS NOT A CLEAR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS (AVERAGE CHANGE SF-36 PHYSICAL-HEALTH SUBSCALE, 1 RCT, N = 60, MD 6.60, 95% CI -2.44 TO 15.64, LOW-QUALITY EVIDENCE). ONLY ONE STUDY REPORTED ADVERSE EFFECTS, FINDING NO INCIDENCE OF ADVERSE EVENTS IN EITHER TREATMENT GROUP. THIS REVIEW WAS SUBJECT TO A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF MISSING OUTCOMES, WHICH INCLUDED GLOBAL STATE, CHANGE IN COGNITION, COSTS OF CARE, EFFECT ON STANDARD CARE, SERVICE INTERVENTION, DISABILITY, AND ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: EVEN THOUGH WE FOUND SOME POSITIVE EVIDENCE IN FAVOUR OF YOGA OVER STANDARD-CARE CONTROL, THIS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED CAUTIOUSLY IN VIEW OF OUTCOMES LARGELY BASED EACH ON ONE STUDY WITH LIMITED SAMPLE SIZES AND SHORT-TERM FOLLOW-UP. OVERALL, MANY OUTCOMES WERE NOT REPORTED AND EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN THIS REVIEW IS OF LOW TO MODERATE QUALITY - -TOO WEAK TO INDICATE THAT YOGA IS SUPERIOR TO STANDARD-CARE CONTROL FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF SCHIZOPHRENIA.	2015	

20 2860  27 YOGA-BASED EXERCISE IMPROVES HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE AND MENTAL WELL-BEING IN OLDER PEOPLE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS. OBJECTIVE: HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) AND MENTAL WELL-BEING ARE ASSOCIATED WITH HEALTHY AGEING. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY POSITIVELY IMPACTS BOTH HRQOL AND MENTAL WELL-BEING. YOGA IS A PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THAT CAN BE MODIFIED TO SUITS THE NEEDS OF OLDER PEOPLE AND IS GROWING IN POPULARITY. WE CONDUCTED A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WITH META-ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF YOGA-BASED EXERCISE ON HRQOL AND MENTAL WELL-BEING IN PEOPLE AGED 60+. METHODS: SEARCHES WERE CONDUCTED FOR RELEVANT TRIALS IN THE FOLLOWING ELECTRONIC DATABASES; MEDLINE, EMBASE, COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS, CINAHL, ALLIED AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE DATABASE, PSYCINFO AND THE PHYSIOTHERAPY EVIDENCE DATABASE (PEDRO) FROM INCEPTION TO JANUARY 2017. TRIALS THAT EVALUATED THE EFFECT OF PHYSICAL YOGA ON HRQOL AND/OR ON MENTAL WELL-BEING IN PEOPLE AGED 60+ YEARS WERE INCLUDED. DATA ON HRQOL AND MENTAL WELL-BEING WERE EXTRACTED. STANDARDISED MEAN DIFFERENCES AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CI) WERE CALCULATED USING RANDOM EFFECTS MODELS. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF TRIALS WAS ASSESSED USING THE PEDRO SCALE. RESULTS: TWELVE TRIALS OF HIGH METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY (MEAN PEDRO SCORE 6.1), TOTALLING 752 PARTICIPANTS, WERE IDENTIFIED AND PROVIDED DATA FOR THE META-ANALYSIS. YOGA PRODUCED A MEDIUM EFFECT ON HRQOL (HEDGES' G = 0.51, 95% CI 0.25-0.76, 12 TRIALS) AND A SMALL EFFECT ON MENTAL WELL-BEING (HEDGES' G = 0.38, 95% CI 0.15-0.62, 12 TRIALS). CONCLUSION: YOGA INTERVENTIONS RESULTED IN SMALL TO MODERATE IMPROVEMENTS IN BOTH HRQOL AND MENTAL WELL-BEING IN PEOPLE AGED 60+ YEARS. FURTHER, RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMAL DOSE OF YOGA TO MAXIMISE HEALTH IMPACT.

MEANWHILE, THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENT OF SLEEP DISTURBANCE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. MORE SPECIFICALLY, COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY FOR INSOMNIA (CBT-I), MINDFULNESS, AND YOGA HAVE SHOWN TO BE 3 PROMISING TREATMENTS WITH VARYING DEGREES OF BENEFIT, SUPPORTING DATA, AND INHERENT LIMITATIONS. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE WILL OUTLINE THE TREATMENT APPROACH FOR SLEEP DISTURBANCE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER AND CONDUCT A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF CBT-I, MINDFULNESS, AND YOGA AS THEY PERTAIN TO THIS PATIENT POPULATION.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
2 2548 25 YOGA FOR CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS. BACKGROUND: YOGA HAS BEEN PRACTICED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING. EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON YOGA HAS BEEN ONGOING FOR SEVERAL DECADES, INCLUDING SEVERAL RECENT STUDIES CONDUCTED WITH CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS. METHODS: THIS REVIEW PROVIDES A GENERAL INTRODUCTION TO YOGA AND A DETAILED REVIEW OF YOGA RESEARCH IN CANCER. RESULTS: NINE STUDIES CONDUCTED WITH CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS YIELDED MODEST IMPROVEMENTS IN SLEEP QUALITY, MOOD, STRESS, CANCER-RELATED DISTRESS, CANCER-RELATED SYMPTOMS, AND OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE. STUDIES CONDUCTED IN OTHER PATIENT POPULATIONS AND HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS HAVE SHOWN BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOMATIC SYMPTOMS, AS WELL AS OTHER ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL FUNCTION. CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS FROM THE EMERGING LITERATURE ON YOGA AND CANCER PROVIDE PRELIMINARY SUPPORT FOR THE FEASIBILITY AND EFFICACY OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR CANCER PATIENTS, ALTHOUGH CONTROLLED TRIALS ARE LACKING. FURTHER RESEARCH IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE RELIABILITY OF THESE EFFECTS AND TO IDENTIFY THEIR UNDERLYING MECHANISMS.	2005	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
3 1190 21 EVIDENCE-BASED YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR PATIENTS WITH CANCER. BACKGROUND: INTRODUCING PATIENTS WITH CANCER TO THE PRACTICE OF YOGA CAN BE BENEFICIAL FOR COPING WITH THE SIDE EFFECTS OF TREATMENT AND THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF CANCER THAT ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT AND DISTRESSING FOR PATIENTS. ONCOLOGY NURSES CAN LEARN TO USE SIMPLE YOGA TECHNIQUES FOR THEMSELVES AND AS INTERVENTIONS WITH THEIR PATIENTS. OBJECTIVES: THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES DETAILS ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A YOGA CLASS FOR PATIENTS WITH CANCER AND PROVIDES DETAILS ABOUT OTHER WAYS NURSES CAN INTEGRATE YOGA INTO ONCOLOGY NURSING AND CANCER CARE. METHODS: CURRENT RESEARCH LITERATURE WAS REVIEWED AND SYNTHESIZED TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR THE USE OF YOGA AS AN EVIDENCE-BASED NURSING INTERVENTION. A DETAILED APPROACH FOR IMPLEMENTING YOGA INTO PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE WAS DELINEATED. FINDINGS: YOGA TECHNIQUES CAN BE EASILY INTEGRATED INTO NURSING PRACTICE AND HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR PATIENTS AND NURSES.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
4 2383 18 YOGA & CANCER INTERVENTIONS: A REVIEW OF THE CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOMES FOR CANCER SURVIVORS. LIMITED RESEARCH SUGGESTS YOGA MAY BE A VIABLE GENTLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OPTION WITH A VARIETY OF HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, PSYCHOSOCIAL AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT BENEFITS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO DETERMINE THE CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES FROM YOGA INTERVENTIONS CONDUCTED WITH CANCER SURVIVORS. A TOTAL OF 25 PUBLISHED YOGA INTERVENTION STUDIES FOR CANCER SURVIVORS FROM 2004-2011 HAD PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES, INCLUDING QUALITY OF LIFE, PSYCHOSOCIAL OR SYMPTOM MEASURES. THIRTEEN OF THESE STUDIES MET THE NECESSARY CRITERIA TO ASSESS CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE FOR EACH OF THE OUTCOMES OF INTEREST WAS EXAMINED BASED ON 1 STANDARD ERROR OF THE MEASUREMENT, 0.5 STANDARD DEVIATION, AND RELATIVE COMPARATIVE EFFECT SIZES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE CONFIDENCE INTERVALS. THIS REVIEW DESCRIBES IN DETAIL THESE PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES, HOW THEY WERE OBTAINED, THEIR RELATIVE CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPLICATIONS FOR BOTH CLINICAL AND RESEARCH SETTINGS. OVERALL, CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES SUGGEST THAT YOGA INTERVENTIONS HOLD PROMISE FOR IMPROVING CANCER SURVIVORS' WELL-BEING. THIS RESEARCH OVERVIEW PROVIDES NEW DIRECTIONS FOR EXAMINING HOW CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE CAN PROVIDE A UNIQUE CONTEXT FOR DESCRIBING CHANGES IN PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES FROM YOGA INTERVENTIONS. RESEARCHERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO EMPLOY INDICES OF CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE IN THE INTERPRETATION AND DISCUSSION OF RESULTS FROM YOGA STUDIES.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
5 2848 17 YOGA, MEDITATION AND MINDFULNESS IN PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY - A REVIEW OF LITERATURE. PURPOSE: CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS UNDERGOING TREATMENT FOR CANCER ARE EXPOSED TO A WIDE VARIETY OF STRESSORS BOTH PHYSICAL AND MENTAL. NOT ONLY ADULTS BUT ALSO CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS INCREASINGLY PRACTICE YOGA IN A HEALTH-PROMOTING MANNER AND TO COPE WITH STRESSFUL SITUATIONS. METHODS: A REVIEW OF LITERATURE WAS CONDUCTED TO PRESENT THE CURRENT OUTCOMES ON YOGA, MEDITATION AND MINDFULNESS FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WHO ARE AFFECTED BY AN ONCOLOGICAL DISEASE. RESULTS: EIGHT STUDIES WERE IDENTIFIED THAT EXAMINED YOGA TREATMENT FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH ONCOLOGICAL DISEASES. THREE STUDIES WERE FOUND ON MINDFULNESS IN PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY. THE STUDIES SUMMARIZED HERE SUGGEST THAT YOGA AND MINDFULNESS COULD HELP TO IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE, REDUCE FATIGUE, IMPROVE ACTIVITY AND FITNESS LEVELS, IMPROVE SLEEP QUALITY, INCREASE APPETITE AND DECREASE ANXIETY IN VARIOUS STAGES OF THE DISEASE AND ITS TREATMENT. THE REVIEWED STUDIES SHOWED THAT YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH ONCOLOGICAL ILLNESSES ARE FEASIBLE IN DIFFERENT SETTINGS AND ARE WELL RECEIVED. CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS OF THE STUDIES SUGGEST THAT YOGA AND MINDFULNESS MAY HELP TO SUPPORT CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS DURING AND AFTER ONCOLOGICAL TREATMENT. BASED ON THE CURRENT BODY OF EVIDENCE IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DRAW CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE EFFICACY OF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS IN PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY PATIENTS. RESEARCH MUST MEET THIS CHALLENGE TO DEVELOP SUITABLE DESIGNS TO FURTHER AND BETTER INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH ONCOLOGICAL DISEASES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
6 1945 29 SALUTE TO THE SUN: A NEW DAWN IN YOGA THERAPY FOR BREAST CANCER. INTRODUCTION: INTEREST IN THE APPLICATION OF YOGA FOR HEALTH BENEFITS IN WESTERN MEDICINE IS GROWING RAPIDLY, WITH A SIGNIFICANT RISE IN PUBLICATIONS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE INCLUSION OF YOGA THERAPY TO THE TREATMENT OF BREAST CANCER CAN IMPROVE THE PATIENT'S PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). METHODS: A SEARCH OF PEER REVIEWED JOURNAL ARTICLES PUBLISHED BETWEEN JANUARY 2009 AND JULY 2014 WAS CONDUCTED. STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IF THEY HAD MORE THAN 15 STUDY PARTICIPANTS, INCLUDED INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION (MBSR) OR YOGA THERAPY WITH OR WITHOUT COMPARISON GROUPS AND HAD STATED PHYSICAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES. RESULTS: SCREENING IDENTIFIED 38 APPROPRIATE ARTICLES. THE MOST REPORTED PSYCHOSOCIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA THERAPY WERE ANXIETY, EMOTIONAL AND SOCIAL FUNCTIONING, STRESS, DEPRESSION AND GLOBAL QOL. THE MOST REPORTED PHYSICAL BENEFITS OF YOGA THERAPY WERE IMPROVED SALIVARY CORTISOL READINGS, SLEEP QUALITY AND LYMPHOCYTE APOPTOSIS. BENEFITS IN THESE AREAS WERE LINKED STRONGLY WITH THE YOGA INTERVENTIONS, IN ADDITION TO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN OVERALL QOL. CONCLUSION: THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THE USE OF YOGA THERAPY TO IMPROVE THE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL QOL FOR BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WITH A RANGE OF BENEFITS RELEVANT TO RADIATION THERAPY. FUTURE STUDIES ARE RECOMMENDED TO CONFIRM THESE BENEFITS. EVIDENCE-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF A YOGA THERAPY PROGRAMME HAVE BEEN DERIVED AND INCLUDED WITHIN THIS REVIEW. LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP IS NECESSARY WITH THESE PROGRAMMES TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF THE YOGA INTERVENTION IN TERMS OF SUSTAINABILITY AND PATIENT OUTCOMES.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
7 2706 21 YOGA INTO CANCER CARE: A REVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE-BASED RESEARCH. TO COPE WITH CANCER AND ITS TREATMENT-RELATED SIDE EFFECTS AND TOXICITIES, PEOPLE ARE INCREASINGLY USING COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE (CAM). CONSEQUENTLY, INTEGRATIVE ONCOLOGY, WHICH COMBINES CONVENTIONAL THERAPIES AND EVIDENCE-BASED CAM PRACTICES, IS AN EMERGING DISCIPLINE IN CANCER CARE. THE USE OF YOGA AS A CAM IS PROVING TO BE BENEFICIAL AND INCREASINGLY GAINING POPULARITY. AN ELECTRONIC DATABASE SEARCH (PUBMED), THROUGH DECEMBER 15, 2016, REVEALED 138 RELEVANT CLINICAL TRIALS (SINGLE-ARMED, NONRANDOMIZED, AND RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS) ON THE USE OF YOGA IN CANCER PATIENTS. A TOTAL OF 10,660 CANCER PATIENTS FROM 20 COUNTRIES WERE RECRUITED IN THESE STUDIES. REGARDLESS OF SOME METHODOLOGICAL DEFICIENCIES, MOST OF THE STUDIES REPORTED THAT YOGA IMPROVED THE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND MARKERS OF IMMUNITY OF THE PATIENTS, PROVIDING A STRONG SUPPORT FOR YOGA'S INTEGRATION INTO CONVENTIONAL CANCER CARE. THIS REVIEW ARTICLE PRESENTS THE PUBLISHED CLINICAL RESEARCH ON THE PREVALENCE OF YOGA'S USE IN CANCER PATIENTS SO THAT ONCOLOGISTS, RESEARCHERS, AND THE PATIENTS ARE AWARE OF THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE USE OF THIS RELATIVELY SAFE MODALITY IN CANCER CARE.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
8 2023 32 SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF YOGA FOR SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT DURING CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. INTRODUCTION: BREAST CANCER IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMONLY DIAGNOSED CANCERS IN WOMEN IN THE US, AND ITS TREATMENTS HAVE SIGNIFICANT PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SIDE EFFECTS AND LONG-TERM COMPLICATIONS CAUSING SIGNIFICANT MORBIDITY AND DECREASED QUALITY OF LIFE. INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE MODALITIES, SUCH AS YOGA, HAVE BEEN FOUND TO REDUCE SIDE EFFECTS OF CONVENTIONAL TREATMENTS WITHOUT INTERFERING WITH THE TREATMENT ITSELF AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE. IN THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW, WE SPECIFICALLY EXPLORED YOGA AS A POTENTIAL OPTION FOR SYMPTOMATIC MANAGEMENT IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING CONVENTIONAL BREAST CANCER TREATMENTS. METHODS: WE PERFORMED A LITERATURE SEARCH THAT WAS CONDUCTED TO INCLUDE THE DATABASES PUBMED, PSYCHINFO, COCHRANE LIBRARY, SCOPUS, AND CINAHL, RESULTING IN 28 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) ARTICLES. WE REVIEW THE RESULTS OF THESE TRIALS REGARDING THE IMPACT OF YOGA IN THIS PATIENT POPULATION. RESULTS: OVERALL, THE MAJORITY OF THE RCT ARTICLES SHOWED SIGNIFICANT BENEFITS OF YOGA INTERVENTION IN VARIOUS ASPECTS OF QUALITY OF LIFE, FATIGUE, NAUSEA/VOMITING, SLEEP QUALITY, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND DISTRESS. THERE ARE SEVERAL STUDIES THAT HAVE EXPLORED THE PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISM BEHIND THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND FOUND THAT YOGA AFFECTS BOTH THE IMMUNE RESPONSE AND INFLAMMATION. DISCUSSION: THESE STUDIES REVEALED THAT YOGA HAS A POTENTIAL THERAPEUTIC ROLE IN THE SYMPTOMATIC MANAGEMENT OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS, ENHANCING QUALITY OF LIFE DURING TREATMENT AS WELL AS IMPROVING ADHERENCE TO TREATMENT. FUTURE STUDIES WITH MORE DEFINED AND CONSISTENT METHODOLOGIES ARE NECESSARY TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL USE OF YOGA THERAPY IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
9 1503 25 INVESTIGATING THE PERCEIVED FEASIBILITY OF INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE IN A CONVENTIONAL ONCOLOGY SETTING: YOGA THERAPY AS A TREATMENT FOR BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. BACKGROUND: A MAJORITY OF CANCER SURVIVORS EXPERIENCE DEBILITATING EFFECT(S) RELATED TO THEIR CANCER DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENTS ACROSS PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, SOCIAL, AND SPIRITUAL DOMAINS. TIMELY AND INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS ARE NEEDED TO ADDRESS THE ADVERSE TREATMENT-RELATED EFFECTS AND OFTEN DISJOINTED SERVICES THAT BREAST CANCER PATIENTS FACE. RECENT STUDIES SUGGEST THAT THE MAJORITY OF BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS ARE USING COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE AT SOME POINT ALONG THEIR CANCER TRAJECTORY. IN RECENT YEARS, SCIENTISTS AND CLINICIANS HAVE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY AMONG CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS. THE CURRENT STUDY EXAMINED THE PERCEIVED FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING YOGA THERAPY AS A TREATMENT SERVICE FOR BREAST CANCER PATIENTS AT A LARGE URBAN CANCER CENTER IN CANADA. METHODS: A MIXED-METHODS APPROACH THAT INCLUDED FOCUS GROUPS AND SELF-REPORTED SURVEYS WITH HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS (HCPS) AND BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WAS USED IN THIS RESEARCH. RESULTS: OVERALL, RESULTS INDICATED THAT BREAST CANCER PATIENTS AND HCPS WERE SUPPORTIVE AND EAGER FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM. SIX THEMES EMERGED FROM THE ANALYSIS OF THE FOCUS GROUP AND THE SURVEY DATA: (1) THE AVAILABILITY OF RESOURCES AND ACCESSIBILITY OF YOGA THERAPY, (2) THE CREDIBILITY AND TRANSPARENCY OF YOGA THERAPY, (3) THE UNDERSTANDING OF YOGA THERAPY, (4) AN EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT, (5) THE THERAPEUTIC CONTEXT, AND (6) THE INTEGRATION OF YOGA THERAPY. SPECIFIC FACILITATORS AND BARRIERS BECAME EVIDENT WITHIN THESE THEMES. CONCLUSIONS: ALTHOUGH ENTHUSIASM FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN INTEGRATIVE YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM WAS APPARENT AMONG BOTH BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS AND HCPS, BARRIERS WERE ALSO IDENTIFIED. THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY ARE CURRENTLY BEING USED TO INFORM A LARGE-SCALE PROGRAM OF RESEARCH AIMED AT DEVELOPING INTEGRATIVE TREATMENT SERVICES FOR BREAST CANCER PATIENTS, BEGINNING WITH YOGA THERAPY.	2013	

10 1484 22 INTEGRATION OF HATHA YOGA AND EVIDENCE-BASED PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENTS FOR COMMON MENTAL DISORDERS: AN EVIDENCE MAP. BACKGROUND: INTEREST IN THE USE OF YOGA TO ENHANCE ENGAGEMENT WITH AND AUGMENT THE BENEFITS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENT HAS GROWN. HOWEVER, A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO REVIEWING EXISTING RESEARCH EXAMINING THE USE OF YOGA WITH PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENT IS LACKING. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS MAPPING REVIEW IDENTIFIED AND SYNTHESISED RESEARCH TRIALLING YOGA AS AN INTEGRATED OR ADJUNCT THERAPY WITH EVIDENCE-BASED PSYCHOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS FOR THE TREATMENT OF ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, PTSD, AND EATING DISORDERS. RESULTS: OVERALL, THE REVIEW IDENTIFIED TEN PUBLISHED AND THREE UNPUBLISHED STUDIES, REPRESENTING EITHER SINGLE GROUP OR SMALL QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH DESIGNS. DISCUSSION: LIMITED BUT PROMISING FINDINGS WERE SHOWN FOR YOGA WITH CBT FOR ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, AND THE INTEGRATION OF YOGA WITHIN INTENSIVE TREATMENT MODELS FOR PTSD. CONCLUSIONS: FUTURE RESEARCH IS ENCOURAGED TO FOCUS ON CONTROLLED TRIALS THAT ENABLE EXAMINATION OF THE COMPONENT EFFECT OF YOGA WHEN APPLIED WITH EVIDENCE-BASED PSYCHOLOGICAL TREATMENT AND ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY DATA TO FURTHER KNOWLEDGE REGARDING A ROLE FOR YOGA IN CLINICAL PRACTICE.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
11 1770 21 POTENTIAL LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF A MIND-BODY INTERVENTION FOR WOMEN WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER: SUSTAINED MENTAL HEALTH IMPROVEMENTS WITH A PILOT YOGA INTERVENTION. DESPITE PHARMACOLOGIC AND PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC ADVANCES OVER THE PAST DECADES, MANY INDIVIDUALS WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD) EXPERIENCE RECURRENT DEPRESSIVE EPISODES AND PERSISTENT DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS DESPITE TREATMENT WITH THE USUAL CARE. YOGA IS A MIND-BODY THERAPEUTIC MODALITY THAT HAS RECEIVED ATTENTION IN BOTH THE LAY AND RESEARCH LITERATURE AS A POSSIBLE ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY FOR DEPRESSION. ALTHOUGH PROMISING, RECENT FINDINGS ABOUT THE POSITIVE MENTAL HEALTH EFFECTS OF YOGA ARE LIMITED BECAUSE FEW STUDIES HAVE USED STANDARDIZED OUTCOME MEASURES AND NONE OF THEM HAVE INVOLVED LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP BEYOND A FEW MONTHS AFTER THE INTERVENTION PERIOD. THE GOAL OF OUR RESEARCH STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND EFFECTS OF A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR WOMEN WITH MDD USING STANDARDIZED OUTCOME MEASURES AND A LONG FOLLOW-UP PERIOD (1YEAR AFTER THE INTERVENTION). THE KEY FINDING IS THAT PREVIOUS YOGA PRACTICE HAS LONG-TERM POSITIVE EFFECTS, AS REVEALED IN BOTH QUALITATIVE REPORTS OF PARTICIPANTS' EXPERIENCES AND IN THE QUANTITATIVE DATA ABOUT DEPRESSION AND RUMINATION SCORES OVER TIME. ALTHOUGH GENERALIZABILITY OF THE STUDY FINDINGS IS LIMITED BECAUSE OF A VERY SMALL SAMPLE SIZE AT THE 1-YEAR FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENT, THE TRENDS IN THE DATA SUGGEST THAT EXPOSURE TO YOGA MAY CONVEY A SUSTAINED POSITIVE EFFECT ON DEPRESSION, RUMINATIONS, STRESS, ANXIETY, AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE. WHETHER AN INDIVIDUAL CONTINUES WITH YOGA PRACTICE, SIMPLE EXPOSURE TO A YOGA INTERVENTION APPEARS TO PROVIDE SUSTAINED BENEFITS TO THE INDIVIDUAL. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS RARE THAT ANY INTERVENTION, PHARMACOLOGIC OR NON-PHARMACOLOGIC, FOR DEPRESSION CONVEYS SUCH SUSTAINED EFFECTS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH MDD, PARTICULARLY AFTER THE TREATMENT IS DISCONTINUED.	2014	
                                                                                                                              
12 2658 26 YOGA IN ADULT CANCER: A PILOT SURVEY OF ATTITUDES AND BELIEFS AMONG ONCOLOGISTS. BACKGROUND: DEPENDING ON INTEREST, KNOWLEDGE, AND SKILLS, ONCOLOGISTS ARE ADAPTING CLINICAL BEHAVIOUR TO INCLUDE INTEGRATIVE APPROACHES, SUPPORTING PATIENTS TO MAKE INFORMED COMPLEMENTARY CARE DECISIONS. THE PRESENT STUDY SOUGHT TO IMPROVE THE KNOWLEDGE BASE IN THREE WAYS: TEST THE ACCEPTABILITY OF A SELF-REPORTED ONLINE SURVEY FOR ONCOLOGISTS.PROVIDE PRELIMINARY DATA COLLECTION CONCERNING KNOWLEDGE, ATTITUDES, BELIEFS, AND CURRENT REFERRAL PRACTICES AMONG ONCOLOGISTS WITH RESPECT TO YOGA IN ADULT CANCER.LIST THE PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF AND BARRIERS TO YOGA INTERVENTION FROM A CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE. METHODS: A 38-ITEM SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRE WAS ADMINISTERED ONLINE TO MEDICAL, RADIATION, AND SURGICAL ONCOLOGISTS IN BRITISH COLUMBIA. RESULTS: SOME OF THE 29 ONCOLOGISTS WHO COMPLETED THE SURVEY (N = 10) REPORTED HAVING RECOMMENDED YOGA TO PATIENTS TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, FATIGUE, STRESS, INSOMNIA, AND MUSCLE OR JOINT STIFFNESS. OTHER RESPONDING ONCOLOGISTS WERE HESITANT OR UNLIKELY TO SUGGEST YOGA FOR THEIR PATIENTS BECAUSE THEY HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF YOGA AS A THERAPY (N = 15) OR BELIEVED THAT SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT ITS USE IS LACKING (N = 11). ALL 29 RESPONDENTS WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THEIR PATIENTS PARTICIPATE IN A CLINICAL TRIAL TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF YOGA. IN QUALITATIVE FINDINGS, ONCOLOGISTS COMPARED YOGA WITH EXERCISE AND SUGGESTED THAT IT MIGHT HAVE SIMILAR PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH BENEFITS THAT WOULD IMPROVE PATIENT CAPACITY TO ENDURE TREATMENT. BARRIERS TO AND LIMITATIONS OF YOGA IN ADULT CANCER ARE ALSO DISCUSSED. CONCLUSIONS: AN ONLINE SELF-REPORT SURVEY IS FEASIBLE, BUT HAS RESPONSE RATE LIMITATIONS. A SMALL NUMBER OF ONCOLOGISTS ARE CURRENTLY RECOMMENDING YOGA TO IMPROVE HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOMES IN ADULT CANCER. RESPONDENTS WOULD SUPPORT CLINICAL YOGA INTERVENTIONS TO IMPROVE THE EVIDENCE BASE IN CANCER PATIENTS, INCLUDING MEN AND WOMEN IN ALL TUMOUR GROUPS.	2015	
                                                                                
13 2642 18 YOGA FOR WOMEN LIVING WITH BREAST CANCER-RELATED ARM MORBIDITY: FINDINGS FROM AN EXPLORATORY STUDY. TREATMENTS FOR BREAST CANCER ASSAULT THE BODY AND CAN DISRUPT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BODY, MIND, AND SPIRIT. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE DISCUSS THE WAYS IN WHICH YOGA WAS EXPERIENCED AND UNDERSTOOD AS A HEALING THERAPY AMONG TEN FEMALE BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS BETWEEN THE AGES OF 26 AND 70 AND LIVING WITH TREATMENT-RELATED ARM MORBIDITY. THE WOMEN PARTICIPATED IN 6 WEEKLY SESSIONS OF GENTLE IYENGAR YOGA AND RESPONDED TO OPEN-ENDED SURVEYS BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION. THE MAJORITY OF WOMEN REPORTED PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL, AND SPIRITUAL BENEFITS FROM THE PRACTICE OF YOGA. SPECIFIC BENEFITS INCLUDED IMPROVEMENTS IN PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND RELIEF FROM SYMPTOMS RELATED TO TREATMENT; INCREASED PEACE OF MIND AND HOPE; AND CONNECTION TO OTHER YOGA PARTICIPANTS. INTEGRAL TO THIS HEALING PROCESS WAS SOCIAL SUPPORT FROM OTHER BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
14 1210 23 EXPLORING DIFFERENT TYPES OF HATHA YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH CANCER. YOGA HAS BEEN PRACTICED FOR MORE THAN 5,000 YEARS AND IS BASED ON THE COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCES OF YOGA PRACTITIONERS OVER TIME. WESTERN COUNTRIES AND SOPHISTICATED MEDICAL FACILITIES USE THIS PRACTICE AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY WITH STANDARD MEDICAL TREATMENTS. YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE. SEVERAL TYPES OF YOGA POTENTIALLY CAN BENEFIT PEOPLE WITH CANCER, INCLUDING HATHA YOGA. THE TYPE OF RECOMMENDED HATHA YOGA IS DEPENDENT ON THE PHYSICAL CONDITIONS AND FITNESS LEVEL OF PATIENTS. THIS ARTICLE EXPLORES THE IMPACT OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF HATHA YOGA ON VARIOUS CANCER-RELATED SYMPTOMS IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER. THE ARTICLE ALSO PROVIDES GUIDELINES FOR HEALTHCARE PERSONNEL-PARTICULARLY NURSES-TO HELP CHOOSE THE RIGHT KIND OF HATHA YOGA THAT SUITS THEIR PATIENTS' NEEDS AND INTERESTS. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED ON MEASURES AND INSTRUCTIONS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS TO KNOW BEFORE RECOMMENDING ANY YOGA TYPE TO THEIR PATIENTS. EVIDENCE OF THE FEASIBILITY AND POTENTIAL EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH CANCER IS PROVIDED.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
15  728 23 EFFECT OF LONG-TERM YOGA PRACTICE ON PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. AIM: BREAST CANCER HAS BECOME A PANDEMIC WITH AN EVER-INCREASING INCIDENCE. ALTHOUGH BETTER DIAGNOSTICS AND TREATMENT MODALITIES HAVE REDUCED MORTALITY, A LARGE NUMBER OF SURVIVORS FACE CANCER AND TREATMENT-RELATED LONG-TERM SYMPTOMS. MANY SURVIVORS ARE TAKING UP YOGA FOR IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). THE PRESENT STUDY ATTEMPTS TO EVALUATE PREDICTORS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL STATES IN BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WITH LONG-TERM YOGA EXPERIENCE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A CASE-CONTROL STUDY RECRUITED EARLY BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS, 30-65 YEARS, COMPLETING TREATMENT > 6 MONTHS BEFORE RECRUITMENT, AND GROUPED THEM BASED ON PRIOR YOGA EXPERIENCE (BCY, N = 27) OR NAIVE (BCN, N = 25). DEMOGRAPHY, CANCER HISTORY, DIET, EXERCISE HABITS, AND YOGA SCHEDULE WERE COLLECTED AND TOOLS TO ASSESS STRESS, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, GENERAL HEALTH, AND QOL WERE ADMINISTERED. MULTIVARIATE LINEAR REGRESSION WAS DONE TO IDENTIFY PREDICTORS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIABLES. RESULTS: BCY HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER STRESS, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, BETTER GENERAL HEALTH, AND QOL (P < 0.001). GLOBAL QOL AND TRAIT ANXIETY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY PREDICTED BY YOGA PRACTICE; DEPRESSION WAS PREDICTED BY YOGA PRACTICE, ANNUAL INCOME, AND SLEEP QUALITY; STATE ANXIETY WAS PREDICTED BY YOGA PRACTICE AND INCOME; AND STRESS WAS PREDICTED BY YOGA PRACTICE AND SLEEP QUALITY. CONCLUSION: RESULTS INDICATE THAT BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS, DOING YOGA, HAVE BETTER PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILES AND ARE ABLE TO DEAL WITH DEMANDING SITUATIONS BETTER. THE PSYCHO-ONCOGENIC MODEL OF CANCER ETIOLOGY SUGGESTS THAT A BETTER PSYCHOLOGICAL STATE IN SURVIVAL HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPROVE PROGNOSIS AND SURVIVAL OUTCOMES AND YOGA MAY BE A SUITABLE PRACTICE FOR STAYING CANCER-FREE FOR A LONGER TIME.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
16  142 20 A PROTOCOL AND PILOT STUDY FOR MANAGING FIBROMYALGIA WITH YOGA AND MEDITATION. FIBROMYALGIA IS A CHRONIC SYNDROME CHARACTERIZED BY WIDESPREAD PAIN, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, STIFFNESS, FATIGUE, HEADACHE, AND MOOD DISORDERS. RECENT RESEARCH HAS RESULTED IN AN IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF FIBROMYALGIA AND ITS POSSIBLE CAUSES. THIS ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS SOME OF THE CURRENT RESEARCH, DISCUSSES A STRATEGY FOR USING YOGA AND MEDITATION AS A THERAPY FOR FIBROMYALGIA SUFFERERS, AND PRESENTS THE RESULTS OF A PRELIMINARY 8-WEEK STUDY USING YOGA AND MEDITATION TO HELP MANAGE FIBROMYALGIA SYMPTOMS. THE STUDY OF 11 PARTICIPANTS FOUND SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE OVERALL HEALTH STATUS OF THE PARTICIPANTS AND IN SYMPTOMS OF STIFFNESS, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE ALSO SEEN IN THE REPORTED NUMBER OF DAYS "FELT GOOD" AND NUMBER OF DAYS "MISSED WORK" BECAUSE OF FIBROMYALGIA. NONSIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE SEEN IN MEASURES OF PAIN, FATIGUE, AND HOW ONE FELT IN THE MORNING. EFFECT SIZES WERE MEDIUM TO LARGE FOR MOST TESTED AREAS. THIS STUDY SUPPORTS THE BENEFITS OF YOGA AND MEDITATION FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH FIBROMYALGIA AND ENCOURAGES FURTHER RESEARCH TO EXPLORE THEIR USE AS STANDARD THERAPIES FOR FIBROMYALGIA.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
17 2292 17 THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF YOGA FOR CHILDREN: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE. PURPOSE: WE COMPLETED A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE ON THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE AND PHYSICAL OUTCOME MEASURES IN THE PEDIATRIC POPULATION. WE EXPLORED VARIOUS DATABASES AND INCLUDED CASE-CONTROL AND PILOT STUDIES, COHORT AND RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS THAT EXAMINED YOGA AS AN EXERCISE INTERVENTION FOR CHILDREN. SUMMARY OF KEY POINTS: USING THE SACKETT LEVELS OF EVIDENCE, THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS THE LITERATURE ON YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY MIND-BODY MOVEMENT THERAPY. WE ADDRESS THE RESEARCH THROUGH THREE PRACTICE PATTERNS ACCORDING TO THE GUIDE TO PHYSICAL THERAPIST PRACTICE AND PROVIDE CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE INCLUSION OF YOGA INTO CLINICAL PRACTICE. STATEMENT OF CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CLINICAL PRACTICE: THE EVIDENCE SHOWS PHYSIOLOGICAL BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR THE PEDIATRIC POPULATION THAT MAY BENEFIT CHILDREN THROUGH THE REHABILITATION PROCESS, BUT LARGER CLINICAL TRIALS, INCLUDING SPECIFIC MEASURES OF QUALITY OF LIFE ARE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE DEFINITIVE EVIDENCE.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
18 2170 22 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON ANXIETY AND STRESS. STRESS AND ANXIETY HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED AS CONTRIBUTORS TO MANY CHRONIC DISEASES AND TO DECREASED QUALITY OF LIFE, EVEN WITH PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT. EFFORTS ARE UNDERWAY TO FIND NON-PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPIES TO RELIEVE STRESS AND ANXIETY, AND YOGA IS ONE OPTION FOR WHICH RESULTS ARE PROMISING. THE FOCUS OF THIS REVIEW IS ON THE RESULTS OF HUMAN TRIALS ASSESSING THE ROLE OF YOGA IN IMPROVING THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF STRESS AND ANXIETY. OF 35 TRIALS ADDRESSING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON ANXIETY AND STRESS, 25 NOTED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN STRESS AND/OR ANXIETY SYMPTOMS WHEN A YOGA REGIMEN WAS IMPLEMENTED; HOWEVER, MANY OF THE STUDIES WERE ALSO HINDERED BY LIMITATIONS, SUCH AS SMALL STUDY POPULATIONS, LACK OF RANDOMIZATION, AND LACK OF A CONTROL GROUP. FOURTEEN OF THE 35 STUDIES REPORTED BIOCHEMICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL MARKERS OF STRESS AND ANXIETY, BUT YIELDED INCONSISTENT SUPPORT OF YOGA FOR RELIEF OF STRESS AND ANXIETY. EVALUATION OF THE CURRENT PRIMARY LITERATURE IS SUGGESTIVE OF BENEFITS OF YOGA IN RELIEVING STRESS AND ANXIETY, BUT FURTHER INVESTIGATION INTO THIS RELATIONSHIP USING LARGE, WELL-DEFINED POPULATIONS, ADEQUATE CONTROLS, RANDOMIZATION AND LONG DURATION SHOULD BE EXPLORED BEFORE RECOMMENDING YOGA AS A TREATMENT OPTION.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
19  836 21 EFFECT OF YOGA ON PATIENTS WITH CANCER: OUR CURRENT UNDERSTANDING. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERAPEUTIC YOGA IMPROVES THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF PATIENTS WITH CANCER. DATA SOURCES: SEARCH OF MEDLINE DATABASE (1950-2010) USING KEY WORDS YOGA, CANCER, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. STUDY SELECTION: PRIORITY WAS GIVEN TO RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL STUDIES CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON TYPICAL SYMPTOMS OF PATIENTS WITH CANCER IN NORTH AMERICA. SYNTHESIS: INITIALLY, 4 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL STUDIES WERE ANALYZED, THEN 2 STUDIES WITHOUT CONTROL GROUPS WERE ANALYZED. THREE STUDIES CONDUCTED IN INDIA AND THE NEAR EAST PROVIDED INTERESTING INFORMATION ON METHODOLOGIES. THE INTERVENTIONS INCLUDED YOGA SESSIONS OF VARYING LENGTH AND FREQUENCY. THE PARAMETERS MEASURED ALSO VARIED AMONG STUDIES. SEVERAL SYMPTOMS IMPROVED SUBSTANTIALLY WITH YOGA (HIGHER QUALITY OF SLEEP, DECREASE IN SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, IMPROVEMENT IN SPIRITUAL WELL-BEING, ETC). IT WOULD APPEAR THAT QUALITY OF LIFE, OR SOME ASPECTS THEREOF, ALSO IMPROVED. CONCLUSION: THE VARIETY OF BENEFITS DERIVED, THE ABSENCE OF SIDE EFFECTS, AND THE COST-BENEFIT RATIO OF THERAPEUTIC YOGA MAKE IT AN INTERESTING ALTERNATIVE FOR FAMILY PHYSICIANS TO SUGGEST TO THEIR PATIENTS WITH CANCER. CERTAIN METHODOLOGIC SHORTCOMINGS, INCLUDING THE LIMITED SIZE OF THE SAMPLES AND VARYING LEVELS OF ATTENDANCE ON THE PART OF THE SUBJECTS, MIGHT HAVE REDUCED THE STATISTICAL STRENGTH OF THE STUDIES PRESENTED. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT THE MEASUREMENT SCALES USED DID NOT SUIT THIS TYPE OF SITUATION AND PATIENT POPULATION, MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT. HOWEVER, FAVOURABLE COMMENTS BY PARTICIPANTS DURING THE STUDIES AND THEIR LEVEL OF APPRECIATION AND WELL-BEING SUGGEST THAT FURTHER RESEARCH IS CALLED FOR TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS OF THESE EFFECTS.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
20 1218 19 EXPLORING THE THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF YOGA AND ITS ABILITY TO INCREASE QUALITY OF LIFE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO ASSESS THE FINDINGS OF SELECTED ARTICLES REGARDING THE THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF YOGA AND TO PROVIDE A COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF THE BENEFITS OF REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE. AS PARTICIPATION RATES IN MIND-BODY FITNESS PROGRAMS SUCH AS YOGA CONTINUE TO INCREASE, IT IS IMPORTANT FOR HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS TO BE INFORMED ABOUT THE NATURE OF YOGA AND THE EVIDENCE OF ITS MANY THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS. THUS, THIS MANUSCRIPT PROVIDES INFORMATION REGARDING THE THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF YOGA AS IT HAS BEEN STUDIED IN VARIOUS POPULATIONS CONCERNING A MULTITUDE OF DIFFERENT AILMENTS AND CONDITIONS. THERAPEUTIC YOGA IS DEFINED AS THE APPLICATION OF YOGA POSTURES AND PRACTICE TO THE TREATMENT OF HEALTH CONDITIONS AND INVOLVES INSTRUCTION IN YOGIC PRACTICES AND TEACHINGS TO PREVENT REDUCE OR ALLEVIATE STRUCTURAL, PHYSIOLOGICAL, EMOTIONAL AND SPIRITUAL PAIN, SUFFERING OR LIMITATIONS. RESULTS FROM THIS STUDY SHOW THAT YOGIC PRACTICES ENHANCE MUSCULAR STRENGTH AND BODY FLEXIBILITY, PROMOTE AND IMPROVE RESPIRATORY AND CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTION, PROMOTE RECOVERY FROM AND TREATMENT OF ADDICTION, REDUCE STRESS, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND CHRONIC PAIN, IMPROVE SLEEP PATTERNS, AND ENHANCE OVERALL WELL-BEING AND QUALITY OF LIFE.	2011

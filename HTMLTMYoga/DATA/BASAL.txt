1 2007 158 STUDY OF YOGA ASANAS IN ASSESSMENT OF PULMONARY FUNCTION IN NIDDM PATIENTS. CERTAIN YOGA ASANAS IF PRACTICED REGULARLY ARE KNOWN TO HAVE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON HUMAN BODY. THESE YOGA PRACTICES MIGHT BE INTERACTING WITH VARIOUS, SOMATO-NEURO-ENDOCRINE MECHANISMS TO HAVE THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS. THE PRESENT STUDY DONE IN TWENTY FOUR NIDDM PATIENTS OF 30 TO 60 YEAR OLD, PROVIDES METABOLIC AND CLINICAL EVIDENCE OF IMPROVEMENT IN GLYCAEMIC CONTROL AND PULMONARY FUNCTIONS. THESE MIDDLE-AGED SUBJECTS WERE TYPE II DIABETICS ON ANTIHYPERGLYCAEMIC AND DIETARY REGIMEN. THEIR BASELINE FASTING AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE AND GLYCOSYLATED HB WERE MONITORED ALONG WITH PULMONARY FUNCTION STUDIES. THE EXPERT GAVE THESE PATIENTS TRAINING IN YOGA ASANAS AND WERE PURSED 30-40 MIN/DAY FOR 40 DAYS UNDER GUIDANCE. THESE ASANAS CONSISTED OF 13 WELL KNOWN POSTURES, DONE IN A SEQUENCE. AFTER 40 DAYS OF YOGA ASANAS REGIMEN, THE PARAMETERS WERE REPEATED. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS (BASAL 190.08 +/- 90.8 IN MG/DL TO 141.5 +/- 79.8 IN MG/DL). THE POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS ALSO DECREASED (276.54 +/- 101.0 IN MG/DL TO 201.75 +/- 104.1 IN MG/DL), GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN SHOWED A DECREASE (9.03 +/- 1.4% TO 7.83 +/- 2.6%). THE FEV1, FVC, PEFR, MVV INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (1.81 +/- 0.4 LT TO 2.08 +/- 0.4 LT, 2.20 +/- 0.6 LT TO 2.37 +/- 0.5 LT, 3.30 +/- 1.0 LT/S TO 4.43 +/- 1.4 LT/S AND 64.59 +/- 25.7 LT MIN TO 76.28 +/- 28.1 LT/MIN RESPECTIVELY). FEV1/FVC% IMPROVED (85 +/- 0.2% TO 89 +/- 0.1%). THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT BETTER GLYCAEMIC CONTROL AND PULMONARY FUNCTIONS CAN BE OBTAINED IN NIDDM CASES WITH YOGA ASANAS AND PRANAYAMA. THE EXACT MECHANISM AS TO HOW THESE POSTURES AND CONTROLLED BREATHING, INTERACT WITH SOMATO-NEURO-ENDOCRINE MECHANISM AFFECTING METABOLIC AND PULMONARY FUNCTIONS REMAINS TO BE WORKED OUT.	2002	
                                                                                                                                                                                      
2 2056  57 THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF YOGA IN DIABETES. TWENTY NIDDM SUBJECTS (MILD TO MODERATE DIABETICS) IN THE AGE GROUP OF 30-60 YEARS WERE SELECTED FROM THE OUT PATIENT CLINIC OF G.T.B. HOSPITAL. THEY WERE ON A 40 DAYS YOGA ASANA REGIME UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF A YOGA EXPERT. 13 SPECIFIC YOGA ASANAS < OR = DONE BY TYPE 2 DIABETES PATIENTS INCLUDED. SURYA NAMASKAR, TRIKONASANA, TADASANA, SUKHASANA, PADMASANA, BHASTRIKA PRANAYAMA, PASHIMOTTANASANA, ARDHMATSYENDRASANA, PAWANMUKTASANA, BHUJANGASANA, VAJRASANA, DHANURASANA AND SHAVASANA ARE BENEFICIAL FOR DIABETES MELLITUS. SERUM INSULIN, PLASMA FASTING AND ONE HOUR POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS AND ANTHROPOMETRIC PARAMETERS WERE MEASURED BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA ASANAS. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN FASTING GLUCOSE LEVELS FROM BASAL 208.3 +/- 20.0 TO 171.7 +/- 19.5 MG/DL AND ONE HOUR POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS DECREASED FROM 295.3 +/- 22.0 TO 269.7 +/- 19.9 MG/DL. THE EXACT MECHANISM AS TO HOW THESE POSTURES AND CONTROLLED BREATHING INTERACT WITH SOMATOENDOCRINE MECHANISM AFFECTING INSULIN KINETICS WAS WORKED OUT. A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN WAIST-HIP RATIO AND CHANGES IN INSULIN LEVELS WERE ALSO OBSERVED, SUGGESTING A POSITIVE EFFECT OF YOGA ASANAS ON GLUCOSE UTILISATION AND FAT REDISTRIBUTION IN NIDDM. YOGA ASANAS MAY BE USED AS AN ADJUNCT WITH DIET AND DRUGS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES.	2005

TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF FORTY DAYS OF YOGIC EXERCISES ON CARDIAC FUNCTIONS IN TYPE 2 DIABETICS. 2. TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF FORTY DAYS OF YOGIC EXERCISES ON BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL, GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN. METHODS: THE PRESENT STUDY DONE IN TWENTY-FOUR TYPE 2 DM CASES PROVIDES METABOLIC AND CLINICAL EVIDENCE OF IMPROVEMENT IN GLYCAEMIC CONTROL AND AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS. THESE MIDDLE-AGED SUBJECTS WERE TYPE II DIABETICS ON ANTIHYPERGLYCAEMIC AND DIETARY REGIMEN. THEIR BASELINE FASTING AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE AND GLYCOSYLATED HB WERE MONITORED ALONG WITH AUTONOMIC FUNCTION STUDIES. THE EXPERT GAVE THESE PATIENTS TRAINING IN YOGA ASANAS AND THEY PURSUED THOSE 30-40 MIN/DAY FOR 40 DAYS UNDER GUIDANCE. THESE ASANAS CONSISTED OF 13 WELL KNOWN POSTURES, DONE IN A SEQUENCE. AFTER 40 DAYS OF YOGA ASANAS REGIMEN, THE PARAMETERS WERE REPEATED. RESULTS: THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS FROM BASAL 190.08 +/- 18.54 IN MG/DL TO 141.5 +/- 16.3 IN MG/DL AFTER YOGA REGIMEN. THE POST PRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS DECREASED FROM 276.54 +/- 20.62 IN MG/DL TO 201.75 +/- 21.24 IN MG/DL, GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN SHOWED A DECREASE FROM 9.03 +/- 0.29% TO 7.83 +/- 0.53% AFTER YOGA REGIMEN. THE PULSE RATE, SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (FROM 86.45 +/- 2.0 TO 77.65 +/- 2.5 PULSE/MIN, FROM 142.0 +/- 3.9 TO 126.0 +/- 3.2 MM OF HG AND FROM 86.7 +/- 2.5 MM OF HG TO 75.5 +/- 2.1 MM OF HG AFTER YOGA REGIMEN RESPECTIVELY). CORRECTED QT INTERVAL (QTC) DECREASED FROM 0.42 +/- 0.0 TO 0.40 +/- 0.0. CONCLUSION: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT BETTER GLYCAEMIC CONTROL AND STABLE AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS CAN BE OBTAINED IN TYPE 2 DM CASES WITH YOGA ASANAS AND PRANAYAMA. THE EXACT MECHANISM AS TO HOW THESE POSTURES AND CONTROLLED BREATHING INTERACT WITH SOMATO-NEURO-ENDOCRINE MECHANISM AFFECTING METABOLIC AND AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS REMAINS TO BE WORKED OUT.	2004	
                                       
4  138  40 A PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE ROLE OF YOGA ASANAS ON OXIDATIVE STRESS IN NON-INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS. NINETEEN SUBJECTS OF NON-INSULIN DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS (NIDDM) BETWEEN THE AGE GROUP OF 30-60 YRS WERE STUDIED TO SEE THE EFFECT OF SPECIFIC YOGA ASANAS ON FASTING AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE (FBG, PPG), SERUM MALONDIALDEHYDE (MDA) AND GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN (HBA(1)) IN ADDITION TO DRUG TREATMENT AND DIET CONTROL. THE DURATION OF DIABETES RANGED FROM 1-10 YEARS. PATIENTS WITH RENAL, CARDIAC AND PROLIFERATIVE RETINAL DISEASES WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE STUDY. THE SAME PATIENTS SERVED AS THEIR OWN CONTROL. SUBJECTS WERE CALLED IN THE MORNING TO THE CARDIO-RESPIRATORY LABORATORY AND WERE GIVEN TRAINING BY A YOGA EXPERT. YOGA ASANAS INCLUDED SURYANAMSKAR, TADASAN, TRIKONASAN, PADMASAN, PRANAYAM, PASCHIMOTTANASAN, ARDHMATSYENDRASAN, PAVANMUKTHASAN, SARPASAN AND SHAVASAN. THE ASANAS WERE DONE EVERY DAY FOR 40 DAYS FOR 30-40 MIN. FBG, PPG, SERUM MDA AND HBA(1) WERE ESTIMATED BEFORE AND AFTER 40 DAYS OF YOGA ASANAS REGIMEN. SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION WAS SEEN IN FBG FROM 220 MG/DL TO 162 MG/DL, PPG FROM 311 MG/DL TO 255 MG/DL, MDA FROM 6 NMOL/L TO 3 NMOL/L AND HBA(1), FROM 8.8% TO 6.4%. SUBJECTS FELT BETTER AND WERE RELIEVED OF THEIR STRESSES AND HAD AN IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR DAY TO DAY PERFORMANCE. THE DECREASE WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P<0.0001 FOR FBG AND PPG, P<0.001 FOR MDA AND FOR HBA(1)).	2001	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
5  781  42 EFFECT OF YOGA ASANAS ON NERVE CONDUCTION IN TYPE 2 DIABETES. TWENTY TYPE 2 DIABETIC SUBJECTS BETWEEN THE AGE GROUP OF 30-60 YEARS WERE STUDIED TO SEE THE EFFECT OF 40 DAYS OF YOGA ASANAS ON THE NERVE CONDUCTION VELOCITY. THE DURATION OF DIABETES RANGED FROM 0-10 YEARS. SUBJECT SUFFERING FROM CARDIAC, RENAL AND PROLIFERATIVE RETINAL COMPLICATIONS WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE STUDY YOGA ASANAS INCLUDED SURYANAMSKAR. TADASAN, KONASAN, PADMASAN PRANAYAM, PASCHIMOTTANSAN ARDHMATSYENDRASAN, SHAVASAN, PAVANMUKTHASAN, SARPASAN AND SHAVASAN. SUBJECTS WERE CALLED TO THE CARDIO-RESPIRATORY LABORATORY IN THE MORNING TIME AND WERE GIVEN TRAINING BY THE YOGA EXPERT. THE YOGA EXERCISES WERE PERFORMED FOR 30-40 MINUTES EVERY DAY FOR 40 DAYS IN THE ABOVE SEQUENCE. THE SUBJECTS WERE PRESCRIBED CERTAIN MEDICINES AND DIET. THE BASAL BLOOD GLUCOSE, NERVE CONDUCTION VELOCITY OF THE MEDIAN NERVE WAS MEASURED AND REPEATED AFTER 40 DAYS OF YOGIC REGIME. ANOTHER GROUP OF 20 TYPE 2 DIABETES SUBJECTS OF COMPARABLE AGE AND SEVERITY, CALLED THE CONTROL GROUP, WERE KEPT ON PRESCRIBED MEDICATION AND LIGHT PHYSICAL EXERCISES LIKE WALKING. THEIR BASAL & POST 40 DAYS PARAMETERS WERE RECORDED FOR COMPARISON. RIGHT HAND AND LEFT HAND MEDIAN NERVE CONDUCTION VELOCITY INCREASED FROM 52.81 +/- 1.1 M/SEC TO 53.87 +/- 1.1 M/SEC AND 52.46 +/- 1.0 TO 54.75 +/- 1/1 M/SEC RESPECTIVELY. CONTROL GROUP NERVE FUNCTION PARAMETERS DETERIORATED OVER THE PERIOD OF STUDY, INDICATING THAT DIABETES IS A SLOWLY PROGRESSIVE DISEASE INVOLVING THE NERVES. YOGA ASANAS HAVE A BENEFICIAL EFFECT ON GLYCAEMIC CONTROL AND IMPROVE NERVE FUNCTION IN MILD TO MODERATE TYPE 2 DIABETES WITH SUB-CLINICAL NEUROPATHY.	2002	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
6 1453  35 INFLUENCE OF PRANAYAMAS AND YOGA-ASANAS ON SERUM INSULIN, BLOOD GLUCOSE AND LIPID PROFILE IN TYPE 2 DIABETES. A DISTINGUISHABLE FEATURE OF TYPE 2 DIABETES BESIDES HYPERGLYCEMIA AND DERANGED LIPID PROFILE IS AN IMPAIRED INSULIN SECRETION, PERIPHERAL INSULIN RESISTANCE AND OBESITY WHICH HAS BECOME A MAJOR HEALTH CONCERN WORLDWIDE. INDIA WITH AN ESTIMATED 31MILLION DIABETICS IN 2000 AND 79MLLIONS BY THE YR 2030 HAS THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF TYPE 2 DIABETICS IN THE WORLD. IN THIS STUDY, WE AIMED TO SEE IF YOGA-ASANAS AND PRANAYAMAS HAVE ANY INFLUENCE IN MODIFYING CERTAIN BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS. SIXTY PATIENTS OF UNCOMPLICATED TYPE 2 DIABETES (AGE 35-60 YRS OF 1-10 YRS DURATION) WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: GROUP 1 (N=30): PERFORMED YOGA ALONG WITH THE CONVENTIONAL HYPOGLYCEMIC MEDICINES AND GROUP 2 (N=30): PATIENTS WHO ONLY RECEIVED CONVENTIONAL MEDICINES. DURATION OF THE STUDY WAS 45 DAYS. BASAL RECORDINGS OF BLOOD GLUCOSE (FASTING AND POST-PRANDIAL), LIPID PROFILE AND SERUM INSULIN WERE TAKEN AT THE TIME OF RECRUITMENT AND THE SECOND READING AFTER FORTY FIVE DAYS. RESULTS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ALL THE BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS IN GROUP 1 WHILE GROUP 2 SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ONLY FEW PARAMETERS, THUS SUGGESTING A BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF YOGA REGIMEN ON THESE PARAMETERS IN DIABETIC PATIENTS.	2008

8 2816  37 YOGA TRAINING IMPROVES METABOLIC PARAMETERS IN OBESE BOYS. YOGA HAS BEEN KNOWN TO HAVE STIMULATORY OR INHIBITORY EFFECTS ON THE METABOLIC PARAMETERS AND TO BE UNCOMPLICATED THERAPY FOR OBESITY. THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO TEST THE EFFECT OF AN 8-WEEK OF YOGA-ASANA TRAINING ON BODY COMPOSITION, LIPID PROFILE, AND INSULIN RESISTANCE (IR) IN OBESE ADOLESCENT BOYS. TWENTY VOLUNTEERS WITH BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) GREATER THAN THE 95TH PERCENTILE WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO YOGA (AGE 14.7+/-0.5 YEARS, N=10) AND CONTROL GROUPS (AGE 14.6+/-1.0 YEARS, N=10). THE YOGA GROUP PERFORMED EXERCISES THREE TIMES PER WEEK AT 40~60% OF HEART-RATE RESERVE (HRR) FOR 8 WEEKS. IR WAS DETERMINED WITH THE HOMEOSTASIS MODEL ASSESSMENT OF INSULIN RESISTANCE (HOMA-IR). AFTER YOGA TRAINING, BODY WEIGHT, BMI, FAT MASS (FM), AND BODY FAT % (BF %) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED, AND FAT-FREE MASS AND BASAL METABOLIC RATE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THAN BASELINE VALUES. FM AND BF % WERE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED IN THE YOGA GROUP COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP (P<0.05). TOTAL CHOLESTEROL (TC) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED IN THE YOGA GROUP (P<0.01). HDL-CHOLESTEROL WAS DECREASED IN BOTH GROUPS (P<0.05). NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE OBSERVED BETWEEN OR WITHIN GROUPS FOR TRIGLYCERIDES, LDL-CHOLESTEROL, GLUCOSE, INSULIN, AND HOMA-IR. OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT AN 8-WEEK OF YOGA TRAINING IMPROVES BODY COMPOSITION AND TC LEVELS IN OBESE ADOLESCENT BOYS, SUGGESTING THAT YOGA TRAINING MAY BE EFFECTIVE IN CONTROLLING SOME METABOLIC SYNDROME FACTORS IN OBESE ADOLESCENT BOYS.	2012

10  887  14 EFFECT OF YOGA TYPE BREATHING ON HEART RATE AND CARDIAC AXIS OF NORMAL SUBJECTS. EFFECT OF INSPIRATORY AND EXPIRATORY PHASES OF NORMAL QUIET BREATHING, DEEP BREATHING AND SAVITRI PRANAYAM TYPE BREATHING ON HEART RATE AND MEAN VENTRICULAR QRS AXIS WAS INVESTIGATED IN YOUNG, HEALTHY UNTRAINED SUBJECTS. PRANAYAM TYPE BREATHING PRODUCED SIGNIFICANT CARDIOACCELERATION AND INCREASE IN QRS AXIS DURING THE INSPIRATORY PHASE AS COMPARED TO EUPNEA. ON THE OTHER HAND, EXPIRATORY EFFORT DURING PRANAYAM TYPE BREATHING DID NOT PRODUCE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN HEART RATE OR QRS AXIS. THE CHANGES IN HEART RATE AND QRS AXIS DURING THE INSPIRATORY AND EXPIRATORY PHASES OF PRANAYAM TYPE BREATHING WERE SIMILAR TO THE CHANGES OBSERVED DURING THE CORRESPONDING PHASES OF DEEP BREATHING.	1986

OBJECTIVES: THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY IS TO EVALUATE THE SHORT-TERM EFFECT OF YOGA ON PLASMA GLUCOSE, LIPID PROFILE, BLOOD PRESSURE AND INSULIN REQUIREMENT IN A PATIENT WITH TYPE 1 DIABETES MELLITUS (T1DM). CASE PRESENTATION: A 28-YEARS OLD FEMALE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH T1DM AT THE AGE OF SEVEN. SHE WAS UNDER HUMAN MIXTARD INSULIN 30-70, THRICE/DAY FOR 15-15-15 UNITS. SHE HAD A HISTORY OF POOR GLYCEMIC CONTROL, DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS AND HYPOGLYCEMIC SHOCK. AT THE AGE OF 27, SHE GOT ADMITTED WITH COMPLAINTS OF GENERAL WEAKNESS, JOINTS STIFFNESS AND WEIGHT LOSS IN OUR HOLISTIC HEALTH CENTRE AND UNDERWENT TWO WEEKS OF YOGA. RESULTS SHOWED A BETTER REDUCTION IN THE PLASMA GLUCOSE LEVELS, LIPID PROFILE, BLOOD PRESSURE AND INSULIN DOSE AND AN INCREASE IN HEMOGLOBIN LEVELS WITH NO EPISODES OF HYPOGLYCEMIA AFTER YOGA. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA MIGHT BE CONSIDERED AS A SAFER AND EFFECTIVE ADJUVANT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF T1DM.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
12  737  37 EFFECT OF PRANAYAMA & YOGA-ASANA ON COGNITIVE BRAIN FUNCTIONS IN TYPE 2 DIABETES-P3 EVENT RELATED EVOKED POTENTIAL (ERP). BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE OF DELAYED COGNITION AS MEASURED BY P300, AN EVOKED POTENTIAL IS OBSERVED IN DIABETES MELLITUS. P300 (OR P3) IS A COMPONENT OF ENDOGENOUS CEREBRAL EVOKED RESPONSE THAT ASSESSES HIGHER FUNCTIONS OF THE BRAIN. OUR STUDY AIMS TO SEE THE ROLE OF PRANAYAMA AND YOGA-ASANA ON P300 LATENCY AND AMPLITUDE IN TYPE 2 DIABETIC PATIENTS. METHODS: SIXTY PATIENTS OF TYPE 2 DIABETES WERE RECRUITED FROM DIABETIC CLINIC AND DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS - CONTROL GROUP ON ONLY CONVENTIONAL MEDICAL THERAPY AND YOGA-GROUP ON CONVENTIONAL MEDICAL THERAPY ALONG WITH PRANAYAMA AND YOGA-ASANA. BASAL RECORDINGS OF P300 AND BLOOD GLUCOSE WERE TAKEN AT THE TIME OF RECRUITMENT AND SECOND RECORDINGS REPEATED AFTER FORTY FIVE DAYS FOR BOTH THE GROUPS. P300 WAS RECORDED ON NIHON KOHDEN NEUROPACK MU MEB 9100 USING AUDITORY "ODD-BALL PARADIGM". THE DATA WERE ANALYSED USING REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA) FOLLOWED BY TUKEY'S TEST AT 5 PER CENT LEVEL OF SIGNIFICANCE. RESULTS: STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THE LATENCY AND THE AMPLITUDE OF N200, P300 WAS OBSERVED IN THE YOGA GROUP AS COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: OUR DATA SUGGEST THAT YOGA HAS A BENEFICIAL EFFECT ON P300 AND THUS CAN BE INCORPORATED ALONG WITH THE CONVENTIONAL MEDICAL THERAPY FOR IMPROVING COGNITIVE BRAIN FUNCTIONS IN DIABETES.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
13  435  34 CARDIOPULMONARY AND METABOLIC EFFECTS OF YOGA IN HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS. BACKGROUND: YOGA THE SPIRITUAL UNION OF MIND WITH THE DIVINE INTELLIGENCE OF THE UNIVERSE AIMS TO LIBERATE A HUMAN BEING FROM CONFLICTS OF BODY-MIND DUALITY. BENEFICIAL CARDIOVASCULAR AND PULMONARY EFFECTS OF YOGA ARE IN PAR WITH AEROBIC EXERCISE, EVEN AMOUNTING TO REPLACE THE EXERCISE MODEL. WE CONDUCTED AN INTERVENTIONAL STUDY IN HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS, TO ANALYZE THE IMPACT OF SHORT-TERM YOGA TRAINING ON CARDIOVASCULAR, PULMONARY, AUTONOMIC FUNCTION TESTS, LIPID PROFILE, AND THYROID FUNCTION TESTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A SAMPLE OF FIFTY NEW RECRUITS ATTENDING THE DISTRICT YOGA CENTER WAS SUBJECT TO 75 MIN YOGA PRACTICE A DAY FOR 41 DAYS. BASAL VALUES OF CARDIOVASCULAR, PULMONARY, AUTONOMIC FUNCTION TESTS, LIPID PROFILE, AND THYROID FUNCTION TESTS WERE RECORDED BEFORE YOGA TRAINING AND WERE REASSESSED FOR POSTYOGA CHANGES AFTER 41 DAYS. RESULTS: AFTER YOGA PRACTICE THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE RESTING HEART RATE, SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE, DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE, AND MEAN BLOOD PRESSURE OF THE PARTICIPANTS. EFFECTS ON AUTONOMIC FUNCTION TESTS WERE VARIABLE AND INCONCLUSIVE. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN FORCED VITAL CAPACITY, FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1 S, AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE AFTER YOGA. A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN BODY MASS INDEX WAS OBSERVED. EFFECTS ON METABOLIC PARAMETERS WERE PROMISING WITH A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN FASTING BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL, SERUM TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, SERUM TRIGLYCERIDES SERUM LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN LEVELS, AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THYROID FUNCTION TESTS AFTER YOGA. CONCLUSION: SHORT-TERM YOGA PRACTICE HAS NO EFFECT ON THYROID FUNCTIONS. YOGA PRACTICE WAS FOUND BENEFICIAL IN MAINTAINING PHYSIOLOGICAL MILIEU PERTAINING TO CARDIOVASCULAR AND OTHER METABOLIC PARAMETERS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                    
14 1925  26 ROLE OF YOGA IN ALIENATING THE MEMORY DECLINE AND FRONTAL LOBE METABOLITE CHANGES IN TYPE 2 DIABETES. RECENT RESEARCH STUDIES HAVE ESTABLISHED THE FACT, THAT GLYCOSYLATION IS CAUSING THE MEMORY DECLINE AND THIS IS FURTHER SUPPORTED BY THE ALTERATION OF BRAIN METABOLITE CONCENTRATIONS IN DIABETES. THE PRESENT STUDY IS HYPOTHESIZED THAT YOGA IS HAVING ALIENATING ABILITY OF MEMORY DECLINE AND ALTERATION OF FRONTAL LOBE METABOLITE CONCENTRATIONS, WHICH ARE THE RESULT OF GLYCOSYLATION IN TYPE 2 DIABETES. FIVE TYPE 2 DIABETIC SUBJECTS OF BOTH THE SEX, AGED BETWEEN 35-55 YEARS, WHO PRACTICED YOGA OVER A PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS IN A YOGA INSTITUTE, WERE RECRUITED AS TEST GROUP. AGE AND SEX MATCHED FIVE TYPE 2 DIABETIC SUBJECTS WERE RECRUITED AS CONTROL GROUP, BOTH THE GROUP SUBJECTS ARE ON ORAL HYPOGLYCAEMIC AGENTS. GLYCOSYLATED HAEMOGLOBIN PERCENTAGE WAS ESTIMATED WITH BIO-RAD INSTRUMENT, FRONTAL LOBE METABOLITES WERE ESTIMATED WITH PROTON MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY (H-MRS), MEMORY WAS CALCULATED WITH PGI-MEMORY SCALE (PGIMS) THAT IS A PART OF PGI-BATTERY OF BRAIN DYSFUNCTION (PGI-BBD), WHICH IS A NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL BATTERY. MEAN GLYCOSYLATED HAEMOGLOBIN PERCENTAGE AND MEMORY DYSFUNCTION RATING IN CONTROL AND TEST GROUP SUBJECTS ARE 6.9+/-0.4 & 7.8+/-1.84 (P=0.03), AND 14+/-1& 6+/-1 (P=0.0001) RESPECTIVELY. RIGHT AND LEFT FRONTAL LOBE N-ACETYL ASPARTATE (NAA) AND MYOIONOSITOL (MI) CONCENTRATIONS WERE MORE OR LESS SIMILAR IN BOTH THE GROUPS. YOGA IS HAVING A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN ALIENATING THE DECLINE IN MEMORY CAUSED BY GLYCOSYLATION IN TYPE 2 DIABETES BUT NOT ON THE ALTERATION OF FRONTAL LOBE NAA AND MI CONCENTRATIONS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
15  895  37 EFFECT OF YOGA-NIDRA ON BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL IN DIABETIC PATIENTS. DIABETES IS A METABOLIC DISORDER, WHICH HAS BECOME A MAJOR HEALTH CHALLENGE WORLDWIDE. SOUTH EAST ASIAN COUNTRIES HAVE A HIGHEST BURDEN OF DIABETES. IN INDIA THE PREVALENCE OF DIABETES IS RISING RAPIDLY ESPECIALLY IN THE URBAN POPULATION BECAUSE OF INCREASING OBESITY AND REDUCED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. AN OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA-NIDRA ON BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL IN DIABETIC PATIENTS. THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON 41, MIDDLE AGED, TYPE-2 DIABETIC PATIENTS, WHO WERE ON ORAL HYPOGLYCAEMIC. THESE PATIENTS WERE DIVIDED IN TO TWO GROUPS: (A) 20 PATIENTS ON ORAL HYPOGLYCAEMIC WITH YOGA-NIDRA, AND (B) 21 WERE ON ORAL HYPOGLYCAEMIC ALONE. YOGA-NIDRA PRACTICED FOR 30 MINUTES DAILY UP TO 90 DAYS, PARAMETERS WERE RECORDED EVERY. 30TH DAY. RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT MOST OF THE SYMPTOMS WERE SUBSIDED (P < 0.004, SIGNIFICANT), AND FALL OF MEAN BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL WAS SIGNIFICANT AFTER 3-MONTH OF YOGA-NIDRA. THIS FALL WAS 21.3 MG/DL, P < 0.0007, (FROM 159 +/- 12.27 TO 137.7 +/- 23.15,) IN FASTING AND 17.95 MG/DL, P = 0.02, (FROM 255.45 +/- 16.85 TO 237.5 +/- 30.54) IN POST PRANDIAL GLUCOSE LEVEL. RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT SUBJECTS ON YOGA-NIDRA WITH DRUG REGIMEN HAD BETTER CONTROL IN THEIR FLUCTUATING BLOOD GLUCOSE AND SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH DIABETES, COMPARED TO THOSE WERE ON ORAL HYPOGLYCAEMICS ALONE.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
16 1443  15 INCREASED MUSCLE ENZYME ACTIVITY AFTER YOGA BREATHING DURING AN EXACERBATION OF ASTHMA. THE CASE IS REPORTED OF A YOGA PRACTITIONER WHO, DURING AN EXACERBATION OF ASTHMA, DEVELOPED A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN SERUM MUSCLE ENZYMES. THIS WAS RELATED TO HIS YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES, WHICH HE USED TO ENHANCE THE DELIVERY OF AEROSOLISED BRONCHODILATORS. AS HIS CONDITION IMPROVED AND THE USE OF THESE YOGA MANOEUVRES DIMINISHED, THE MUSCLE ENZYME LEVELS FELL TO NORMAL.	1988	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
17 1476  30 INTEGRATED YOGA AND NATUROPATHY MODULE IN MANAGEMENT OF METABOLIC SYNDROME: A CASE REPORT. A 50-YEAR-OLD MALE PARTICIPANT WITH SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE, DIAGNOSED WITH METABOLIC SYNDROME (METS) [OBESITY, TYPE-2 DIABETES MELLITUS, HYPERTENSION] AND HYPOTHYROIDISM SINCE 2013, WAS ADMINISTERED INTEGRATED YOGA AND NATUROPATHY (IYN) FOR 6 WEEKS AS A TAILOR MADE INDIVIDUALIZED PROTOCOL AT THE RESIDENTIAL INTEGRATIVE MEDICAL FACILITY IN BANGALORE BETWEEN OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER 2015. THE RESULTS SHOWED REDUCTION IN WEIGHT (97.9 KG TO 74.6 KG), BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) (35.1 KG/M(2) TO 27.86 KG/M(2)), TOTAL CHOLESTEROL (192 MG% TO 145 MG%), TRIGLYCERIDES (153 MG% TO 90 MG%), LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (LDL) (124 MG% TO 81 MG%), HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (HDL) (40 MG% TO 46 MG%), FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE (110 MG/DL TO 75 MG/DL), POSTPRANDIAL GLUCOSE (267 MG/DL TO 100 MG/DL), GLYCATED HEMOGLOBIN (HBA1C) (7.8%-7.1%), THYROID STIMULATING HORMONE (TSH) (6.90 MUIU/ML TO 3.052 MUIU/ML). FOLLOWING THE INTERVENTION, THE ANTI-HYPERTENSIVE, ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC, THYROID RAISING AND ANALGESIC MEDICINES WERE NOT REQUIRED TO BE CONTINUED. HIS KNEE PAIN MINIMIZED ON DISCHARGE AS OBSERVED ON A VISUAL ANALOG SCALE. HE HAD AN IMPROVED FEELING OF WELLNESS AND OVERALL FUNCTIONAL HEALTH. ALL HIS PARAMETERS WERE WITHIN NORMAL RANGE AT THE 12-WEEKS FOLLOW-UP, AS HE HAD INCORPORATED THE LIFESTYLE PROGRAM INTO HIS DAILY ROUTINE. THIS CASE REPORT SUGGESTS THAT LIFESTYLE CHANGE BY INTEGRATION OF SPECIFIC NON-DRUG YOGA AND NATUROPATHIC INTERVENTION IS USEFUL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF METS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
18 1928  39 ROLE OF YOGA IN DIABETES. THE SCIENCE OF YOGA IS AN ANCIENT ONE. IT IS A RICH HERITAGE OF OUR CULTURE. SEVERAL OLDER BOOKS MAKE A MENTION OF THE USEFULNESS OF YOGA IN THE TREATMENT OF CERTAIN DISEASES AND PRESERVATION OF HEALTH IN NORMAL INDIVIDUALS. THE EFFECT OF YOGIC PRACTICES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES HAS NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED WELL. WE CARRIED OUT WELL DESIGNED STUDIES IN NORMAL INDIVIDUALS AND THOSE WITH DIABETES TO ASSESS THE ROLE OF YOGIC PRACTICES ON GLYCAEMIC CONTROL, INSULIN KINETICS, BODY COMPOSITION EXERCISE TOLERANCE AND VARIOUS CO-MORBIDITIES LIKE HYPERTENSION AND DYSLIPIDEMIA. THESE STUDIES WERE BOTH SHORT TERM AND LONG-TERM. THESE STUDIES HAVE CONFIRMED THE USEFUL ROLE OF YOGA IN THE CONTROL OF DIABETES MELLITUS. FASTING AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS CAME DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY. GOOD GLYCAEMIC STATUS CAN BE MAINTAINED FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME. THERE WAS A LOWERING OF DRUG REQUIREMENT AND THE INCIDENCE OF ACUTE COMPLICATIONS LIKE INFECTION AND KETOSIS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE INSULIN KINETICS AND THOSE OF COUNTER-REGULATORY HORMONES LIKE CORTISOL. THERE WAS A DECREASE IN FREE FATTY ACIDS. THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN LEAN BODY MASS AND DECREASE IN BODY FAT PERCENTAGE. THE NUMBER OF INSULIN RECEPTORS WAS ALSO INCREASED. THERE WAS AN IMPROVEMENT IN INSULIN SENSITIVITY AND DECLINE IN INSULIN RESISTANCE. ALL THESE SUGGEST THAT YOGIC PRACTICES HAVE A ROLE EVEN IN THE PREVENTION OF DIABETES. THERE IS A BENEFICIAL EFFECT ON THE CO-MORBID CONDITIONS LIKE HYPERTENSION AND DYSLIPIDEMIA.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
19  821  22 EFFECT OF YOGA ON EXERCISE TOLERANCE IN NORMAL HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS. TWELVE NORMAL HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS (6 MALES AND 6 FEMALES) UNDERGOING YOGA TRAINING FOR 90 DAYS WERE STUDIED FOR THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON EXERCISE TOLERANCE. THEIR AGES RANGED FROM 18 TO 28 YEARS. THE VOLUNTEERS WERE TAUGHT ONLY PRANAYAMA FOR THE FIRST 20 DAYS AND LATER ON YOGIC ASANAS WERE ADDED. SUB-MAXIMAL EXERCISE TOLERANCE TEST WAS DONE ON A MOTORIZED TREADMILL BY USING BALKE'S MODIFIED PROTOCOL, INITIALLY, AFTER 20 DAYS (PHASE-I) AND AFTER 90 DAYS OF YOGA TRAINING (PHASE-II). PYRUVATE AND LACTATE IN VENOUS BLOOD AND BLOOD GASES IN CAPILLARY BLOOD WERE ESTIMATED IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND AFTER THE EXERCISE. MINUTE VENTILATION AND OXYGEN CONSUMPTION WERE ESTIMATED BEFORE AND DURING THE TEST. POST EXERCISE BLOOD LACTATE WAS ELEVATED SIGNIFICANTLY DURING INITIAL AND PHASE-I, BUT NOT IN PHASE-II. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION OF MINUTE VENTILATION AND OXYGEN CONSUMPTION ONLY IN MALES IN PHASE-I AND II AT THE TIME WHEN THE VOLUNTEERS REACHED THEIR 80% OF THE PREDICTED HEART RATE. FEMALE VOLUNTEERS WERE ABLE TO GO TO HIGHER LOADS OF EXERCISE IN PHASE-I AND II.	1986	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
20 1634  27 MODELING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON THE PROGRESSION OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE IN A DISH. ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD) ACCOUNTS FOR 80% OF ALL DEMENTIA CASES, MAKING IT THE MOST COMMON FORM OF DEMENTIA. AGING SERVES AS THE MAIN RISK FACTOR FOR AD, BUT EARLY ONSET AD CAN ALSO OCCUR IN INDIVIDUALS YOUNGER THAN 65 YEARS. AD RESULTS FROM PROGRESSIVE NEURODEGENERATION LEADING TO DYSFUNCTIONAL SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION IN THE BRAIN. THE CASCADE HYPOTHESIS OF AD STATES THAT AMYLOID PRECURSOR PROTEIN (APP) METABOLISM BECOMES IMPAIRED EITHER BY MUTATION OR AN INTERLEUKIN-MEDIATED STRESS RESPONSE TO INJURY, RESULTING IN THE SPLICING OF HARMFUL OLIGOMERIC FORMS OF AMYLOID BETA (ABETA). THESE OLIGOMERS DISRUPT EXTRACELLULAR RECEPTOR BINDING, INTRACELLULAR FUNCTION, AND CELLULAR MEMBRANE INTEGRITY. YOGA AND MEDITATIVE PRACTICES SLOW THE PROGRESSION OF THE COGNITIVE DECLINE ASSOCIATED WITH AD. HOWEVER, THE BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THIS THERAPEUTIC EFFECT REMAIN ELUSIVE. HERE, WE INVESTIGATED THE ABILITY OF NEUROTRANSMITTERS RELEASED DURING YOGA AND MEDITATIVE PRACTICES TO RESCUE NEURONS FROM SYNAPTIC DYSFUNCTION IN AN IN VITRO ALZHEIMER'S MODEL CREATED BY CULTURING BASAL FOREBRAIN CHOLINERGIC NEURONS WITH PHYSIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT LEVELS OF THE I-42 ISOFORM OF OLIGOMERIC ABETA (OALPHABETAI-42). WE FOUND THAT THE NEUROTRANSMITTERS DOPAMINE AND HISTAMINE PRODUCE A COOPERATIVE ACTION WITH SEROTONIN TO REVERSE THE LOSS OF CHOLINE ACETYLTRANSFERASE (CHAT) BY OALPHABETAI-42. THE LOSS OF CHAT, THE ENZYME RESPONSIBLE FOR PROCESSING THE CHOLINERGIC NEUROTRANSMITTER ACETYLCHOLINE, CONTRIBUTES TO THE SYNAPTIC DYSFUNCTION EXPERIENCED DURING AD. THESE NEUROTRANSMITTERS INHIBIT NITRIC OXIDE SYNTHESIS CAUSED BY OALPHABETAI-42, PREVENTING OXIDATIVE AND NITROSATIVE STRESS. SEROTONIN ACTIVATES AN ALTERNATE CLEAVAGE OF APP TO PRODUCE A FRAGMENT WITH KNOWN NEUROTROPHIC EFFECTS, GIVING IT THE UNIQUE ABILITY TO INHIBIT THE OALPHABETAI-42 PRODUCTION CYCLE. WE HYPOTHESIZE HERE THAT THESE CONCERTED ACTIONS LEAD TO THE PROTECTION OF CHOLINERGIC SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION IN AD.	2018

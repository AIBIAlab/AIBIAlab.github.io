1  906 154 EFFECTIVENESS OF APP-BASED YOGA OF IMMORTALS (YOI) INTERVENTION FOR INSOMNIA IN ASIAN POPULATION DURING PANDEMIC RESTRICTIONS. THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) PANDEMIC CREATED SIGNIFICANT PSYCHOLOGICAL CHALLENGES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING STRESS, EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, AND INSOMNIA. IN ADDITION, SOCIAL DISTANCING, TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS, AND SPREAD OF DISEASE HAVE RESULTED IN UNIQUE CHALLENGES, CREATING BARRIERS TO HEALTHCARE ACCESS. COMPARED TO THE RATE PRIOR TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CLINICAL INSOMNIA RATES HAVE BEEN REPORTED. WITH WELL-KNOWN LIMITATIONS OF CURRENTLY ESTABLISHED TREATMENTS (E.G., COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY-INSOMNIA (CBT-I), PHARMACOTHERAPY), THERE IS A NEED TO EXPLORE OTHER EFFECTIVE AND SAFE TREATMENT MODALITIES TO TREAT INSOMNIA, ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT CAN BE USED REMOTELY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF APP-BASED INTERVENTION TO TREAT INSOMNIA IN THE CURRENT ERA OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC (USING THE YOGA OF IMMORTALS (YOI) APP). THIS PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY WAS APPROVED BY THE INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD. ALL PARTICIPANTS IN THIS STUDY WERE ASKED TO COMPLETE AN ONLINE SURVEY INCLUDING DEMOGRAPHIC DATA AND VALIDATED INSOMNIA SEVERITY INDEX (ISI) AT BASELINE (15 MAY 2020), 4 WEEKS, AND 8 WEEKS AFTER STARTING THE YOI INTERVENTION. SURVEY DATA WAS EXPORTED USING MICROSOFT EXCEL. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS DONE USING THE GRAPHPAD PRISM 8. YOI INTERVENTION SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED THE MEAN ISI SCORES IN ALL CATEGORIES OF INSOMNIA (SEVERE, MODERATE, AND SUBTHRESHOLD) AT EACH FOLLOW-UP (P </= 0.0001). THE IMPROVEMENT WAS SIGNIFICANT AMONG ALL AGE GROUPS AND IN BOTH GENDERS. IN OUR STUDY, YOI WAS A NOVEL AND EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR IMPROVING INSOMNIA SYMPTOMS AND MAY BE A NEW ADDITION TO THE ARMAMENTARIUM OF INSOMNIA MANAGEMENT. BEING APP-BASED, THIS HAS POTENTIAL WIDER APPLICABILITY, ESPECIALLY DURING THE CURRENT COVID-19 PANDEMIC.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
2 2730  54 YOGA OF IMMORTALS INTERVENTION REDUCES SYMPTOMS OF DEPRESSION, INSOMNIA AND ANXIETY. BACKGROUND: DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND DISORDERED SLEEP ARE SOME COMMON SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH SUB-OPTIMAL MENTAL HEALTH. DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES HAVE GROWN INCREASINGLY MORE PREVALENT IN THE POPULATION. DUE TO SOCIAL DISTANCING AND OTHER LIMITATIONS DURING THE PANDEMIC, THERE IS A NEED FOR HOME-BASED, FLEXIBLE INTERVENTIONS THAT CAN IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH. THE YOGA OF IMMORTALS (YOI) MOBILE APPLICATION PROVIDES A STRUCTURED INTERVENTION THAT CAN BE USED ON ANY MOBILE DEVICE AND APPLIED FROM THE USER'S HOME. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 1,505 PARTICIPANTS WERE ENROLLED IN THE STUDY AND USED THE YOI APP FOR AN 8-WEEK PERIOD. PARTICIPANTS WERE ASKED TO FILL OUT THREE QUESTIONNAIRES: THE PATIENT HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE, 8 ITEMS (PHQ-8), THE GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER QUESTIONNAIRE (GAD-7) AND THE INSOMNIA SEVERITY INDEX (ISI). THESE THREE ITEMS WERE COMPLETED BY 1,297 PARTICIPANTS A TOTAL OF FOUR TIMES: BEFORE STARTING YOI, TWO MORE TIMES DURING USE, AND A FOURTH TIME AFTER THE 8-WEEK USAGE PERIOD. CHANGES IN PHQ8, GAD7 AND ISI IN PARTICIPANTS WERE COMPARED TO A CONTROL GROUP, WHO DID NOT USE THE YOI APP BUT COMPLETED ALL QUESTIONNAIRES (590 CONTROLS FINISHED ALL QUESTIONNAIRES). RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS REPORTED SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY-RELATED SYMPTOMS. COMPARED TO BASELINE, PHQ-8 SCORES DECREASED 50% ON AVERAGE AFTER THE 8-WEEK PERIOD. GAD-7 SCORES ALSO DECREASED BY 40-50% ON AVERAGE, AND ISI SCORES DECREASED BY 50%. THESE CHANGES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER (P < 0.05) THAN THAT OBSERVED IN THE CONTROL GROUP. PARTICIPANTS WHO REPORTED A PREVIOUS DIAGNOSIS OF DEPRESSION AND GENERALIZED ANXIETY REPORTED SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER DECREASES IN PHQ-8 AND GAD-7 AS COMPARED TO PARTICIPANTS WITH NO PRIOR DIAGNOSIS (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: REGULAR USE OF THE YOI INTERVENTION OVER AN 8-WEEK PERIOD LED TO SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN SYMPTOMS OF BOTH DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, AS WELL AS ALLEVIATION OF INSOMNIA.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
3 1718  40 PERCEIVED STRESS, RESILIENCE, WELL-BEING, AND COVID 19 RESPONSE IN ISHA YOGA PRACTITIONERS COMPARED TO MATCHED CONTROLS: A RESEARCH PROTOCOL. OBJECTIVES: THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT STRESSOR WORLDWIDE AND REPORTS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, DEPRESSION, SEDENTARY LIFESTYLES, AND OVERALL DECREASED WELLBEING ARE INCREASING. YOGA PRACTICES HAVE BEEN FOUND TO IMPROVE MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH. THE PURPOSE OF THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IS TO COMPARE ISHA YOGA PRACTITIONERS TO CONTROLS ON PERCEIVED STRESS, RESILIENCE, WELLBEING, AND PROTECTION AND RECOVERY FROM COVID-19. TRIAL DESIGN. IN THIS PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL, THE EFFECTS OF YOGA PRACTICES ARE BEING COMPARED BETWEEN SEASONED YOGA PRACTITIONERS WITH TWO CONTROLS WHO ARE AGE (+/-3 YEARS), GENDER MATCHED, AND LIVING IN THE SAME NEIGHBORHOOD. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WILL BE ASKED TO COMPLETE A SERIES OF WEB-BASED SURVEYS AT BASELINE, SIX WEEKS, AND 12 WEEKS. THESE SURVEYS INCLUDE VALIDATED SCALES AND OBJECTIVE QUESTIONS ON COVID-19 INFECTION AND MEDICAL HISTORY. THE VALIDATED QUESTIONNAIRES ASSESS STRESS, MOOD STATES, RESILIENCE, AND OVERALL WELLBEING. QUESTIONNAIRES, WEEKLY ACTIVITY DIARIES, AND MEDICAL HISTORY, WILL BE COLLECTED USING REDCAP. RESULTS: WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT ROUTINE YOGA PRACTICE DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC WILL REDUCE STRESS, ENHANCE WELL-BEING, AND PROVIDE PROTECTIVE EFFECTS AGAINST COVID-19. CONCLUSION: WITH THE GROWING CONCERN ABOUT THE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL IMPACTS OF COVID-19 AND INCREASED INTEREST IN ALTERNATIVE PRACTICES SUCH AS YOGIC PRACTICES, THIS STUDY WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE ABOUT THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF YOGA FOR EMOTIONAL, MENTAL, AND PHYSICAL HEALTH CONDITIONS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
4  115  31 A PILOT STUDY OF A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR THE TREATMENT OF ANXIETY IN YOUNG PEOPLE WITH EARLY PSYCHOSIS. BACKGROUND: ANXIETY IS COMMON IN YOUNG PEOPLE WITH EARLY PSYCHOSIS AND TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR THIS CO-MORBIDITY REMAIN LIMITED. YOGA IS A PROMISING ADJUNCT INTERVENTION THAT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE ANXIETY FOR ADULTS WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA, THEREFORE THIS PILOT STUDY EVALUATED THE ACCEPTABILITY AND POTENTIAL EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR ANXIETY IN EARLY PSYCHOSIS. METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE SINGLE ARM PILOT STUDY OF A YOGA INTERVENTION WAS CONDUCTED WITHIN AN EARLY INTERVENTION FOR PSYCHOSIS SERVICE. RATES OF ATTENDANCE, AS WELL AS SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY PRE AND POST YOGA SESSION WERE MEASURED. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 14 YOUNG PEOPLE PARTICIPATED IN THE STUDY AND OVER 70% ATTENDED HALF OR MORE OF THE YOGA SESSIONS OFFERED. SIGNIFICANT TRANSIENT REDUCTION IN STATE ANXIETY AFTER A SINGLE SESSION OF YOGA WAS OBSERVED (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: YOGA WAS FOUND TO BE AN ACCEPTABLE AND POTENTIALLY EFFECTIVE ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT FOR ANXIETY IN EARLY PSYCHOSIS AND THE RESULTS WARRANT FURTHER CLINICAL TRIALS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
5 1732  32 PERSPECTIVE OF PATIENTS REFERRED TO YOGA CENTER IN A TERTIARY NEUROPSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL: A CROSS-SECTIONAL RETROSPECTIVE STUDY. BACKGROUND: YOGA HAS BEEN EXTENSIVELY USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE OR COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY IN PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS DEPENDING ON THE TYPE AND SEVERITY OF THE DISORDERS. HOWEVER, DATA RELATED TO PERSPECTIVE ON YOGA SERVICES AND THE BENEFITS AND ADVERSE EFFECTS ATTRIBUTED TO YOGA BY PATIENTS WITH MAJOR PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS IS LACKING. AIM: THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO ASSESS FEEDBACK OF THE PATIENTS WHO ATTENDED YOGA SESSIONS AT A YOGA CENTER IN A TERTIARY NEUROPSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS WAS A CROSS-SECTIONAL RETROSPECTIVE STUDY USING A SPECIFIC QUESTIONNAIRE TO GET FEEDBACK FROM PATIENTS REFERRED TO THE NIMHANS INTEGRATED CENTER FOR YOGA, AT THE END OF THEIR YOGA TRAINING. RESULTS: TWO HUNDRED AND ONE PATIENTS' DATA WERE INCLUDED IN THIS RETROSPECTIVE STUDY. MOST OF THE PATIENTS WERE REFERRED BY THE DOCTORS. THE YOGA MODULE FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA WAS MOST COMMONLY UTILIZED, FOLLOWED BY DEPRESSION. ON AN AVERAGE, PATIENTS ATTENDED 13 SESSIONS. MOST OF THEM PRACTICED YOGA FOR 1-2 WEEKS AND HAD MISSED LESS THAN 2 SESSIONS. THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE PATIENTS REPORTED THAT PRACTICING YOGA HELPED THEM. SPEARMAN CORRELATION ANALYSIS REVEALED POSITIVE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN IMPROVEMENT ATTRIBUTED TO YOGA AND VARIABLES AFFECTING QUALITY OF YOGA SERVICES AT THE CENTER, INCLUDING THE QUALITY OF YOGA SESSIONS ATTENDED. OVERALL HEALTH AND SLEEP IMPROVEMENT ALSO POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH IMPROVEMENT ATTRIBUTED TO YOGA. A MINORITY OF PATIENTS REPORTED ADVERSE EFFECTS, ALTHOUGH THESE DID NOT LEAD TO DISCONTINUATION. CONCLUSION: IN THIS RETROSPECTIVE STUDY OF PATIENTS REFERRED TO A YOGA CENTER IN A TERTIARY PSYCHIATRIC FACILITY, THE MAJORITY OF PATIENTS WITH MAJOR MENTAL DISORDERS WERE ABLE TO PRACTICE YOGA UNDER SUPERVISION AND REPORTED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SYMPTOMS WITH MINIMAL ADVERSE EFFECTS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
6 1243  38 FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA, AEROBIC AND STRETCHING-TONING EXERCISE PROGRAM FOR ADULT CANCER SURVIVORS: THE STAYFIT TRIAL. BACKGROUND: THE USE OF YOGA AS A MIND-BODY PRACTICE HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY POPULAR AMONG CLINICAL POPULATIONS AND OLDER ADULTS WHO USE THIS PRACTICE TO MANAGE AGE AND CHRONIC DISEASE-RELATED SYMPTOMS. ALTHOUGH YOGA CONTINUES TO GAIN POPULARITY AMONG PRACTITIONERS AND RESEARCHERS, PILOT STUDIES THAT EXAMINE ITS FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY, ESPECIALLY AMONG CANCER SURVIVORS, ARE LIMITED. FEASIBILITY STUDIES PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN DETERMINING WHETHER THE TARGET POPULATION IS LIKELY TO ENGAGE WITH LARGER SCALE EFFICACY AND EFFECTIVENESS TRIALS. IN THIS PAPER WE PRESENT FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY DATA FROM A 12-WEEK RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) CONDUCTED WITH ADULT CANCER SURVIVORS. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS N = 78 (MEAN AGE: 55 YEARS) WERE RANDOMIZED TO ONE OF THREE GROUPS: A HATHA YOGA, AEROBIC EXERCISE, OR STRETCHING-TONING CONTROL GROUP WITH GROUP EXERCISE CLASSES HELD FOR 150 MIN/WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS. HEREIN WE REPORT FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY, INCLUDING ENROLLMENT RATES, ATTENDANCE, ATTRITION AND ADVERSE EVENTS, AND PARTICIPANT FEEDBACK AND SATISFACTION DATA. RESULTS: OF THE 233 ADULTS SCREENED, 109 WERE ELIGIBLE AND 78 RANDOMIZED TO ONE OF THE THREE INTERVENTION ARMS. SESSION ATTENDANCE WAS HIGH FOR ALL GROUPS (75.5-89.5%) AND 17 PARTICIPANTS DROPPED OUT DURING THE 12-WEEK INTERVENTION. PROGRAM SATISFACTION WAS HIGH (4.8 OR HIGHER OUT OF 5) AND NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. ONE COHORT (N = 15) OF THE INTERVENTION TRANSITIONED TO REMOTE INTERVENTION DELIVERY DUE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. FEASIBILITY DATA FROM THESE PARTICIPANTS SUGGESTED THAT SYNCHRONIZED GROUP EXERCISE CLASSES VIA ZOOM WITH A LIVE INSTRUCTOR WERE ACCEPTABLE AND ENJOYABLE. PARTICIPANT FEEDBACK REGARDING MOST AND LEAST HELPFUL ASPECTS OF THE PROGRAM AS WELL AS SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE YOGA INTERVENTIONS ARE SUMMARIZED. CONCLUSIONS: OVERALL, THE YOGA INTERVENTION WAS HIGHLY FEASIBLE AND ACCEPTABLE. THE FEASIBILITY PARAMETERS FROM THIS TRIAL CAN AID RESEARCHERS IN ESTIMATING RECRUITMENT RATES FOR DESIRED SAMPLE SIZES TO SUCCESSFULLY RANDOMIZE AND RETAIN CANCER SURVIVORS IN SHORT- AND LONG-TERM YOGA-BASED EFFICACY AND EFFECTIVENESS TRIALS. THE FINDINGS ALSO PROVIDE EVIDENCE TO CLINICIANS WHO CAN RECOMMEND UP TO 150 MIN OF A COMBINATION OF EXERCISES-AEROBIC, YOGA, OR STRETCHING-TONING TO THEIR CANCER PATIENTS IN ORDER TO IMPROVE HEALTH AND WELLBEING DURING CANCER SURVIVORSHIP.	2021	

7 2235  30 THE IMPACT OF YOGA UPON FEMALE PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM HYPOTHYROIDISM. OBJECTIVE: TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF FEMALE HYPOTHYROID PATIENTS. DESIGN: THE WHO QUALITY OF LIFE SCALE(22) WAS USED TO ASSESS THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF 20 FEMALE HYPOTHYROID PATIENTS. SUBJECTS ATTENDED ONE HOUR YOGA SESSIONS DAILY FOR A PERIOD OF ONE MONTH. A PRETEST-POST-TEST RESEARCH DESIGN WAS USED FOR DATA ANALYSIS. RESULTS: PATIENTS' QUALITY OF LIFE SCORES FOLLOWING THE YOGA PROGRAM WERE GREATER THAN SCORES OBTAINED PRIOR TO UNDERTAKING YOGA (P < 0.01). PATIENTS ALSO REPORTED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR PERCEPTION OF THE OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE AND OF THEIR HEALTH POST YOGA INTERVENTION. CONCLUSIONS: IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT YOGA IS VALUABLE IN HELPING THE HYPOTHYROID PATIENTS TO MANAGE THEIR DISEASE-RELATED SYMPTOMS. YOGA MAY BE CONSIDERED AS SUPPORTIVE OR COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY IN CONJUNCTION WITH MEDICAL THERAPY FOR THE TREATMENT OF HYPOTHYROID DISORDER.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
8 2609  41 YOGA FOR QUALITY OF LIFE IN INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC DISEASE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC DISEASES, INCLUDING HEART DISEASE, STROKE, CANCER, AND CHRONIC PULMONARY DISEASE ARE THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH AND DISABILITY WORLDWIDE. COMPOUNDING SYMPTOMS AND LOSS OF FUNCTION, PEOPLE LIVING WITH CHRONIC DISEASE OFTEN EXPERIENCE REDUCED QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). VARIOUS PHYSICAL AND MENTAL PRACTICES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO RELIEVE STRESS AND IMPROVE QOL. YOGA IS A PHYSICAL AND MENTAL PRACTICE THAT MAY BE A VIABLE APPROACH FOR IMPROVING QOL IN PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC DISEASE. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE AND SUMMARIZE THE EVIDENCE FOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA ON QOL IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC DISEASE. DESIGN: THE STUDY DESIGN WAS A A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WITH QUALITATIVE SYNTHESIS. METHODS: WE INCLUDED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS THAT EVALUATED THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON QOL OR HEALTH-RELATED QOL (HRQOL) FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC DISEASE. WE INCLUDED ONLY STUDIES THAT USED AT LEAST 1 PREVIOUSLY VALIDATED MEASURE OF QOL OR HRQOL AND SPECIFIED A MINIMUM DURATION OF FOLLOW-UP OF AT LEAST 1 WK. INTERVENTIONS: WE INCLUDED BOTH MOVEMENT-BASED AND BREATH-BASED YOGA PRACTICES. STUDIES THAT INCLUDED YOGA AS PART OF A LARGER INTERVENTION PROGRAM (EG, MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION TRAINING) OR STUDIES THAT DID NOT PROVIDE FINDINGS SPECIFIC TO YOGA WERE EXCLUDED. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: THE PRIMARY OUTCOME ANALYZED WAS IMPROVEMENT IN QOL AS MEASURED BY A VALIDATED QOL OR HRQOL SCALE. RESULTS: AMONG THE 1488 STUDIES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED ON INITIAL SEARCH, 7 ARTICLES MET ALL INCLUSION CRITERIA. FIVE STUDIES REPORTED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE OVER USUAL CARE ALONE FOR IMPROVEMENT OF QOL IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC DISEASE, BUT THE CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DIFFERENCES WAS CLEAR IN ONLY 1 TRIAL. WE FOUND CONSIDERABLE HETEROGENEITY AMONG THE INCLUDED STUDIES AND STUDY QUALITY WAS GENERALLY LOW. CONCLUSIONS: MORE HIGH-QUALITY RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE VALUE OF YOGA AS AN ADJUNCTIVE APPROACH TO IMPROVING QOL IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC DISEASE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
9 1844  41 QUALITATIVE IMPRESSIONS OF A YOGA NIDRA PRACTICE FOR INSOMNIA: AN EXPLORATORY MIXED-METHODS DESIGN. INTRODUCTION: INSOMNIA AFFECTS UP TO HALF OF THE U.S. POPULATION, AND DUE TO LIMITATIONS OF CURRENT TREATMENTS, THERE IS A GROWING INTEREST IN MIND-BODY PRACTICES TO REDUCE INSOMNIA. TO UNDERSTAND HOW A GUIDED MEDITATION PRACTICE, YOGA NIDRA, MAY AFFECT RELAXATION AND ALIGN WITH CURRENT DESCRIPTIONS OF NONPHARMACEUTICAL PRACTICES THAT COULD IMPROVE SLEEP, QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE METHODS WERE USED TO EXPLORE PARTICIPANT EXPERIENCE OF A SINGLE YOGA NIDRA PRACTICE, ADMINISTERED IN A GROUP SETTING. METHODS: CURRENT INSOMNIA (INSOMNIA SEVERITY INDEX), SLEEP PRACTICES, AND MOOD (POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE AFFECT SCHEDULE [PANAS]) WERE MEASURED AT INTAKE. AFTER 30 MIN OF YOGA NIDRA PRACTICE, THE PANAS WAS READMINISTERED. IN A FOCUS GROUP THAT FOLLOWED, PARTICIPANTS DISCUSSED THEIR EXPERIENCE BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER THE PRACTICE AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF REPEATING IT. SIX GROUPS WERE CONDUCTED. ALL INTERESTED ADULTS WERE WELCOME TO JOIN. RESULTS: IN THE FINAL SAMPLE OF 33 INDIVIDUALS (79% FEMALE), 80% OF PARTICIPANTS REPORTED INSOMNIA AT INTAKE AND 45% REPORTED A REGULAR MIND-BODY PRACTICE, SUPPORTING THE PREVALENCE OF INSOMNIA IN THE SOCIETY AS WELL AS THE INTEREST IN MIND-BODY PRACTICES. AFTER THE YOGA NIDRA INTERVENTION, MEAN NEGATIVE AFFECT DECREASED 5.6 +/- 4.5 POINTS, A 31% DECREASE FROM BASELINE, AND POSITIVE AFFECT DECREASED 3.5 +/- 9.7 POINTS, A 13% DECREASE. THREE MAJOR THEMES WERE IDENTIFIED FROM FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS: RESPONSE TO THE PRACTICE (RELAXATION, PERCEIVED SLEEP, AND SENSE WITHDRAWAL); FACTORS THAT AFFECT ENGAGEMENT (DELIVERY METHOD AND INTRAPERSONAL FACTORS); AND POTENTIAL AS A CLINICAL INTERVENTION (FOR CONDITIONS INCLUDING SLEEP, ANXIETY, AND PAIN). CONCLUSION: YOGA NIDRA APPEARED TOLERABLE WITHIN THE SAMPLE, AND DESCRIPTIONS SUGGEST IT MAY BE USEFUL FOR ENHANCING RELAXATION, FACILITATING SLEEP, EASING ANXIETY, AND REDUCING PAIN. RESULTS FROM THIS STUDY WILL INFORM THE DESIGN OF FUTURE STUDIES OF YOGA NIDRA FOR INSOMNIA AND RELATED CONDITIONS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
10 2383  31 YOGA & CANCER INTERVENTIONS: A REVIEW OF THE CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOMES FOR CANCER SURVIVORS. LIMITED RESEARCH SUGGESTS YOGA MAY BE A VIABLE GENTLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OPTION WITH A VARIETY OF HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, PSYCHOSOCIAL AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT BENEFITS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO DETERMINE THE CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES FROM YOGA INTERVENTIONS CONDUCTED WITH CANCER SURVIVORS. A TOTAL OF 25 PUBLISHED YOGA INTERVENTION STUDIES FOR CANCER SURVIVORS FROM 2004-2011 HAD PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES, INCLUDING QUALITY OF LIFE, PSYCHOSOCIAL OR SYMPTOM MEASURES. THIRTEEN OF THESE STUDIES MET THE NECESSARY CRITERIA TO ASSESS CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE FOR EACH OF THE OUTCOMES OF INTEREST WAS EXAMINED BASED ON 1 STANDARD ERROR OF THE MEASUREMENT, 0.5 STANDARD DEVIATION, AND RELATIVE COMPARATIVE EFFECT SIZES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE CONFIDENCE INTERVALS. THIS REVIEW DESCRIBES IN DETAIL THESE PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES, HOW THEY WERE OBTAINED, THEIR RELATIVE CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPLICATIONS FOR BOTH CLINICAL AND RESEARCH SETTINGS. OVERALL, CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES SUGGEST THAT YOGA INTERVENTIONS HOLD PROMISE FOR IMPROVING CANCER SURVIVORS' WELL-BEING. THIS RESEARCH OVERVIEW PROVIDES NEW DIRECTIONS FOR EXAMINING HOW CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE CAN PROVIDE A UNIQUE CONTEXT FOR DESCRIBING CHANGES IN PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES FROM YOGA INTERVENTIONS. RESEARCHERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO EMPLOY INDICES OF CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE IN THE INTERPRETATION AND DISCUSSION OF RESULTS FROM YOGA STUDIES.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
11 2385  39 YOGA ADHERENCE IN OLDER WOMEN SIX MONTHS POST-OSTEOARTHRITIS INTERVENTION. BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) IS A HIGHLY PREVALENT CONDITION WORLDWIDE. YOGA IS POTENTIALLY A SAFE AND FEASIBLE OPTION FOR MANAGING OA; HOWEVER, THE EXTENT OF LONG-TERM YOGA ADHERENCE IS UNKNOWN. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE YOGA ADHERENCE 6 MONTHS AFTER PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED AN OA INTERVENTION PROGRAM. METHODS: THIS FOLLOW-UP STUDY EMPLOYED A CROSS-SECTIONAL DESCRIPTIVE DESIGN USING SURVEY, INTERVIEW, AND VIDEO RECORDINGS TO COLLECT BOTH QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DATA. A TOTAL OF 31 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED AND RETURNED THE SURVEY, AND 10 VIDEOTAPED THEIR YOGA PRACTICE FOR 1 WEEK AND PARTICIPATED IN A FACE-TO-FACE INTERVIEW. RESULTS: A MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS (N=19, 61%) REPORTED THAT THEY WERE STILL PRACTICING YOGA 6 MONTHS AFTER THE INTERVENTION PROGRAM. ON AVERAGE, PARTICIPANTS REPORTED PRACTICING 21 TO 30 MINUTES OF YOGA PER DAY (32%) 3 TO 4 DAYS PER WEEK (47%). "FEELING GOOD OR FEELING BETTER AFTER YOGA PRACTICE" (50%) AND "SET ASIDE A TIME" (31%) WERE THE MOST COMMON MOTIVATING FACTORS FOR YOGA ADHERENCE. DEALING WITH HEALTH PROBLEMS (42%), HAVING PAIN (25%), AND BEING TOO BUSY (25%) WERE THE MAJOR BARRIERS. QUALITATIVE DATA REVEALED THAT PARTICIPANTS: (1) USED MINDFUL YOGA MOVEMENT, (2) INCORPORATED OTHER FORMS OF EXERCISE AND RESOURCES DURING YOGA PRACTICE, AND (3) CREATED PERSONALIZED YOGA PROGRAMS. ADDITIONALLY, THE PARTICIPANTS REPORTED LESS OA PAIN, INCREASED PHYSICAL ENDURANCE, AND MORE RELAXATION. CONCLUSION: MANY PARTICIPANTS ADHERED TO YOGA PRACTICE 6 MONTHS POST-INTERVENTION ALTHOUGH NOT AT THE FREQUENCY AND SEQUENCE AS PRESCRIBED. FEELING BETTER AFTER PRACTICE MOTIVATED PARTICIPANTS, BUT OTHER FACTORS REMAINED KEY BARRIERS.	2015

IT INCLUDES LIVE-STREAMED GROUP-YOGA SESSIONS TWICE A WEEK AND AN APP WITH INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO SELF-PERFORM YOGA. AIM: TO DESCRIBE A STUDY PROTOCOL FOR A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) INCLUDING A PROCESS EVALUATION AND REPORT ON A PILOT STUDY EVALUATING METHOD- AND INTERVENTION-RELATED COMPONENTS INCLUDING FEASIBILITY, SAFETY, AND EFFICACY. METHODS: TEN PARTICIPANTS WITH HEART FAILURE AGED BETWEEN 41-76 YEARS WERE RANDOMISED TO TELE-YOGA (N = 5) OR TO THE CONTROL GROUP (N = 5). IN THE PILOT STUDY RECRUITMENT, ENROLMENT, RANDOMISATION, AND DATA COLLECTION OF ALL OUTCOMES INCLUDING PRIMARY, SECONDARY AND PROCESS EVALUATION MEASURES WERE TESTED ACCORDING TO THE STUDY PROTOCOL. FIDELITY, ADHERENCE AND ACCEPTABILITY TO THE TELE-YOGA GROUP TRAINING AND APP USE WAS DETERMINED. SAFETY WAS ASSESSED BY ADVERSE EVENTS. RESULTS: THE PILOT REVEALED THAT THE METHODOLOGICAL ASPECT OF THE PROTOCOL WORKED SUFFICIENTLY IN ALL ASPECTS EXCEPT FOR MISSING DATA IN THE PHYSICAL TEST OF TWO PARTICIPANTS AND ONE PARTICIPANT IN THE CONTROL-GROUP THAT DROPPED OUT OF THE STUDY AT THREE MONTHS FOLLOW-UP. THE TELE-YOGA TRAINING DID NOT LEAD TO ANY ADVERSE EVENTS OR INJURIES, ADHERENCE OF TELE-YOGA WAS SUFFICIENT ACCORDING TO PRESET LIMITS. THE TELE-YOGA INTERVENTION ALSO SHOWED SOME FAVOURABLE TRENDS OF IMPROVEMENTS IN THE COMPOSITE-END POINT COMPARED TO THE ACTIVE CONTROL GROUP. HOWEVER, SINCE DATA ONLY WAS PRESENTED DESCRIPTIVELY DUE TO THE SMALL SAMPLE SIZE, THE IMPACT OF THESE TRENDS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED CAREFULLY. CONCLUSION: OUR PILOT STUDY SHOWED PROMISING RESULTS IN FEASIBILITY, SAFETY, AND ACCEPTABILITY OF THE TELE-YOGA INTERVENTION. SOME CHANGES IN THE PROTOCOL HAVE BEEN MADE TO DECREASE THE RISK OF MISSING DATA IN THE MEASURES OF PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND IN THE FULL-SCALE RCT NOW ONGOING THE RESULTS OF THE SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION FOR 300 PARTICIPANTS HAVE INCLUDED THE ESTIMATED LEVEL OF DROP OUTS AND MISSING DATA.	2021	
                                                                                                            
14 1707  32 PATTERNS OF YOGA PRACTICE AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY FOLLOWING A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR ADULTS WITH OR AT RISK FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES. BACKGROUND: THE CURRENT STUDY DESCRIBED PATTERNS OF YOGA PRACTICE AND EXAMINED DIFFERENCES IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OVER TIME BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS WITH OR AT RISK FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES WHO COMPLETED AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION COMPARED WITH CONTROLS. METHODS: A LONGITUDINAL COMPARATIVE DESIGN MEASURED THE EFFECT OF A YOGA INTERVENTION ON YOGA PRACTICE AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, USING DATA AT BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION MONTHS 3, 6, AND 15. RESULTS: DISPARATE PATTERNS OF YOGA PRACTICE OCCURRED BETWEEN INTERVENTION AND CONTROL PARTICIPANTS OVER TIME, BUT THE SUBJECTIVE DEFINITION OF YOGA PRACTICE LIMITS INTERPRETATION. MULTILEVEL MODEL ESTIMATES INDICATED THAT TREATMENT GROUP DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE IN THE RATE OF CHANGE IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OVER THE STUDY PERIOD. WHILE AGE AND EDUCATION WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT INDIVIDUAL PREDICTORS, THE INCLUSION OF THESE VARIABLES IN THE MODEL DID IMPROVE FIT. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS INDICATE THAT AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OVER TIME. FURTHER RESEARCH IS NECESSARY TO EXPLORE THE INFLUENCE OF YOGA ON BEHAVIORAL HEALTH OUTCOMES AMONG INDIVIDUALS WITH OR AT RISK FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
15 1770  38 POTENTIAL LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF A MIND-BODY INTERVENTION FOR WOMEN WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER: SUSTAINED MENTAL HEALTH IMPROVEMENTS WITH A PILOT YOGA INTERVENTION. DESPITE PHARMACOLOGIC AND PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC ADVANCES OVER THE PAST DECADES, MANY INDIVIDUALS WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER (MDD) EXPERIENCE RECURRENT DEPRESSIVE EPISODES AND PERSISTENT DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS DESPITE TREATMENT WITH THE USUAL CARE. YOGA IS A MIND-BODY THERAPEUTIC MODALITY THAT HAS RECEIVED ATTENTION IN BOTH THE LAY AND RESEARCH LITERATURE AS A POSSIBLE ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY FOR DEPRESSION. ALTHOUGH PROMISING, RECENT FINDINGS ABOUT THE POSITIVE MENTAL HEALTH EFFECTS OF YOGA ARE LIMITED BECAUSE FEW STUDIES HAVE USED STANDARDIZED OUTCOME MEASURES AND NONE OF THEM HAVE INVOLVED LONG-TERM FOLLOW-UP BEYOND A FEW MONTHS AFTER THE INTERVENTION PERIOD. THE GOAL OF OUR RESEARCH STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY, ACCEPTABILITY, AND EFFECTS OF A YOGA INTERVENTION FOR WOMEN WITH MDD USING STANDARDIZED OUTCOME MEASURES AND A LONG FOLLOW-UP PERIOD (1YEAR AFTER THE INTERVENTION). THE KEY FINDING IS THAT PREVIOUS YOGA PRACTICE HAS LONG-TERM POSITIVE EFFECTS, AS REVEALED IN BOTH QUALITATIVE REPORTS OF PARTICIPANTS' EXPERIENCES AND IN THE QUANTITATIVE DATA ABOUT DEPRESSION AND RUMINATION SCORES OVER TIME. ALTHOUGH GENERALIZABILITY OF THE STUDY FINDINGS IS LIMITED BECAUSE OF A VERY SMALL SAMPLE SIZE AT THE 1-YEAR FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENT, THE TRENDS IN THE DATA SUGGEST THAT EXPOSURE TO YOGA MAY CONVEY A SUSTAINED POSITIVE EFFECT ON DEPRESSION, RUMINATIONS, STRESS, ANXIETY, AND HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE. WHETHER AN INDIVIDUAL CONTINUES WITH YOGA PRACTICE, SIMPLE EXPOSURE TO A YOGA INTERVENTION APPEARS TO PROVIDE SUSTAINED BENEFITS TO THE INDIVIDUAL. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT IS RARE THAT ANY INTERVENTION, PHARMACOLOGIC OR NON-PHARMACOLOGIC, FOR DEPRESSION CONVEYS SUCH SUSTAINED EFFECTS FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH MDD, PARTICULARLY AFTER THE TREATMENT IS DISCONTINUED.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
16   87  40 A MIXED METHODS EVALUATION OF AN INDIVIDUALISED YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS: PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVES: TO EXPLORE PATIENTS' EXPERIENCES OF AN INDIVIDUALISED YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA), SPECIFICALLY IN TERMS OF ITS ACCEPTABILITY AND IMPACT ON PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES. DESIGN: TEN PATIENTS TOOK PART IN A 16 WEEK YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION IN A HOSPITAL SETTING, CONSISTING OF 10 ONE-TO-ONE CONSULTATIONS WITH A YOGA THERAPIST FOLLOWED BY TWO GROUP REVIEW SESSIONS. CHANGES IN HEALTH (EQ-5D, HADS) WERE ASSESSED PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION AND AT 12-MONTH FOLLOW-UP. IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED POST-INTERVENTION AND ANALYSED USING THEMATIC ANALYSIS. RESULTS: ATTENDANCE OF THE 1-TO-1 SESSIONS WAS HIGH (98 %) AND ALL PARTICIPANTS REPORTED STRONG COMMITMENT TO THEIR PERSONALISED HOME PRACTICE. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN MEASURES OF DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, PAIN, QUALITY OF LIFE AND GENERAL HEALTH AT POST-INTERVENTION AND 12-MONTHS (P < 0.05). IN INTERVIEWS, ALL BUT ONE PARTICIPANT REPORTED POSITIVE CHANGES TO THEIR SYMPTOMS AND SEVERAL REPORTED REDUCTIONS IN THEIR MEDICATION AND BROADER BENEFITS SUCH AS IMPROVED SLEEP, MOOD AND ENERGY, ENABLING RE-ENGAGEMENT WITH LIFE. THE PERSONALLY TAILORED NATURE OF THE PRACTICE AND PERCEIVED BENEFITS WERE KEY MOTIVATIONAL FACTORS. PARTICULAR VALUE WAS PLACED ON THE THERAPEUTIC FUNCTION OF THE CONSULTATION AND PROVISION OF TOOLS TO MANAGE STRESS AND BUILD RESILIENCE. CONCLUSION: THIS YOGA THERAPY INTERVENTION WAS POSITIVELY RECEIVED BY PATIENTS WITH RA, WITH HIGH LEVELS OF ADHERENCE TO BOTH THE TREATMENTS AND TAILORED HOME PRACTICE. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA THERAPY HAS POTENTIAL AS AN ADJUNCT THERAPY TO IMPROVE RA SYMPTOMS, INCREASE SELF-CARE BEHAVIOURS AND MANAGE STRESS AND NEGATIVE AFFECT SUCH AS ANXIETY. A LARGER MULTI-CENTRE STUDY IS THEREFORE WARRANTED.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
17 2170  31 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON ANXIETY AND STRESS. STRESS AND ANXIETY HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED AS CONTRIBUTORS TO MANY CHRONIC DISEASES AND TO DECREASED QUALITY OF LIFE, EVEN WITH PHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT. EFFORTS ARE UNDERWAY TO FIND NON-PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPIES TO RELIEVE STRESS AND ANXIETY, AND YOGA IS ONE OPTION FOR WHICH RESULTS ARE PROMISING. THE FOCUS OF THIS REVIEW IS ON THE RESULTS OF HUMAN TRIALS ASSESSING THE ROLE OF YOGA IN IMPROVING THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF STRESS AND ANXIETY. OF 35 TRIALS ADDRESSING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON ANXIETY AND STRESS, 25 NOTED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN STRESS AND/OR ANXIETY SYMPTOMS WHEN A YOGA REGIMEN WAS IMPLEMENTED; HOWEVER, MANY OF THE STUDIES WERE ALSO HINDERED BY LIMITATIONS, SUCH AS SMALL STUDY POPULATIONS, LACK OF RANDOMIZATION, AND LACK OF A CONTROL GROUP. FOURTEEN OF THE 35 STUDIES REPORTED BIOCHEMICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL MARKERS OF STRESS AND ANXIETY, BUT YIELDED INCONSISTENT SUPPORT OF YOGA FOR RELIEF OF STRESS AND ANXIETY. EVALUATION OF THE CURRENT PRIMARY LITERATURE IS SUGGESTIVE OF BENEFITS OF YOGA IN RELIEVING STRESS AND ANXIETY, BUT FURTHER INVESTIGATION INTO THIS RELATIONSHIP USING LARGE, WELL-DEFINED POPULATIONS, ADEQUATE CONTROLS, RANDOMIZATION AND LONG DURATION SHOULD BE EXPLORED BEFORE RECOMMENDING YOGA AS A TREATMENT OPTION.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
18 2673  31 YOGA IN PRIMARY HEALTH CARE: A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY TO ACCESS THE EFFECTS ON QUALITY OF LIFE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. BACKGROUND: AND PURPOSE: YOGA IS GROWING IN POPULARITY, BUT ITS BENEFITS AND INTEGRATION INTO PRIMARY CARE REMAIN UNCERTAIN. HERE, WE DETERMINE YOGA EFFECTS ON QUALITY OF LIFE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, AND EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF INTRODUCING YOGA AT PRIMARY CARE LEVEL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS IS A PROSPECTIVE, LONGITUDINAL, QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY, WITH AN INTERVENTION (N=49) AND A CONTROL GROUP (N=37). YOGA GROUP UNDERWENT 24-WEEKS PROGRAM OF ONE-HOUR SESSIONS. OUR PRIMARY ENDPOINT WAS QUALITY OF LIFE AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, AS WELL AS SATISFACTION LEVEL AND ADHERENCE RATE. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS REPORTED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ALL DOMAINS OF QUALITY OF LIFE AND A REDUCTION OF PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES PSYCHOLOGICAL QUALITY OF LIFE (P=0.046). CONCLUSION: YOGA IN PRIMARY CARE IS FEASIBLE, SAFE AND HAS A SATISFACTORY ADHERENCE, AS WELL AS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON PSYCHOLOGICAL QUALITY OF LIFE OF PARTICIPANTS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
19 1684  26 OPEN TRIAL OF VINYASA YOGA FOR PERSISTENTLY DEPRESSED INDIVIDUALS: EVIDENCE OF FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF VINYASA YOGA AS AN ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSED PATIENTS WHO WERE NOT RESPONDING ADEQUATELY TO ANTIDEPRESSANT MEDICATION. THE AUTHORS ALSO PLANNED TO ASK PARTICIPANTS FOR QUALITATIVE FEEDBACK ON THEIR EXPERIENCE OF THE CLASS AND TO ASSESS CHANGE OVER TIME IN DEPRESSION AND IN POSSIBLE MEDIATING VARIABLES. THE AUTHORS RECRUITED 11 PARTICIPANTS IN 1 MONTH FOR AN 8-WEEK OPEN TRIAL OF YOGA CLASSES. THEY FOUND THAT 10 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENTS, 9 OF 10 WERE POSITIVE ABOUT THEIR EXPERIENCE, AND ALL PROVIDED FEEDBACK ABOUT WHAT WAS AND WAS NOT HELPFUL ABOUT YOGA, AS WELL AS BARRIERS TO CLASS ATTENDANCE. OVER THE 2-MONTH PERIOD, PARTICIPANTS EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN AN ASPECT OF MINDFULNESS AND IN BEHAVIOR ACTIVATION. THIS PILOT STUDY PROVIDED SUPPORT FOR CONTINUING TO INVESTIGATE VINYASA YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION.

20  198  31 A REGULAR YOGA INTERVENTION FOR STAFF NURSE SLEEP QUALITY AND WORK STRESS: A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIAL. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: ALTHOUGH MANY STUDIES HAVE ASSESSED THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN OLDER INDIVIDUALS, MINIMAL RESEARCH HAS FOCUSED ON HOW NURSES USE YOGA TO IMPROVE SLEEP QUALITY AND TO REDUCE WORK STRESS AFTER WORK HOURS. WE USED THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX IN CHINESE AND THE QUESTIONNAIRE ON MEDICAL WORKER'S STRESS IN CHINESE TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON THE QUALITY OF SLEEP AND WORK STRESS OF STAFF NURSES EMPLOYED BY A GENERAL HOSPITAL IN CHINA. BACKGROUND: DISTURBANCES IN THE CIRCADIAN RHYTHM INTERRUPT AN INDIVIDUAL'S PATTERN OF SLEEP. STUDY DESIGN: CONVENIENT SAMPLING METHOD. METHODS: ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NURSES WERE RANDOMISED INTO TWO GROUPS: A YOGA GROUP AND A NON-YOGA GROUP. THE YOGA GROUP PERFORMED YOGA MORE THAN TWO TIMES EVERY WEEK FOR 50-60 MINUTES EACH TIME AFTER WORK HOURS. THE NG GROUP DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN YOGA. AFTER SIX MONTHS, SELF-REPORTED SLEEP QUALITY AND WORK STRESS WERE COMPARED BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS, AND THEN WE USED LINEAR REGRESSION TO CONFIRM THE INDEPENDENT FACTORS RELATED TO SLEEP QUALITY. RESULTS: NURSES IN THE YOGA GROUP HAD BETTER SLEEP QUALITY AND LOWER WORK STRESS COMPARED WITH NURSES IN THE NON-YOGA GROUP. THE LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL INDICATED THAT NURSING EXPERIENCE, AGE AND YOGA INTERVENTION WERE SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO SLEEP QUALITY. CONCLUSION: REGULAR YOGA CAN IMPROVE SLEEP QUALITY AND REDUCE WORK STRESS IN STAFF NURSES. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: THIS STUDY PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO NURSE SLEEP QUALITY AND WORK STRESS, THEREBY TAKING CORRESPONDING MEASURES TO REDUCE WORK PRESSURE AND IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES.	2015

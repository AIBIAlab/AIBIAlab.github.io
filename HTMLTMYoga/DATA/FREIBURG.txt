1 2270 112 THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOGA INVOLVEMENT, MINDFULNESS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING. OBJECTIVES: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE HOW DIFFERENT LEVELS OF YOGA INVOLVEMENT ARE RELATED TO DIFFERENT PARAMETERS OF MENTAL HEALTH AND ILLNESS. DESIGN AND SETTING: A TOTAL SAMPLE OF 455 PARTICIPANTS (410 FEMALES) WERE INVESTIGATED BY MEANS OF AN INTERNET SURVEY. 362 YOGA PRACTITIONERS (327 FEMALES) RATED THEIR DEGREE OF YOGA INVOLVEMENT ON THE YOGA IMMERSION SCALE. A CONTROL GROUP WAS COMPRISED OF 93 GYMNASTICS PRACTITIONERS (83 FEMALES). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL INVENTORY FOR RELIGIOUS/SPIRITUAL WELL-BEING, THE FREIBURGER MINDFULNESS INVENTORY AND THE BRIEF SYMPTOM INVENTORY FOR PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS. RESULTS: HIGHLY INVOLVED YOGA PRACTITIONERS EXHIBITED A SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED AMOUNT OF MINDFULNESS AND RELIGIOUS/SPIRITUAL WELL-BEING (BOTH P<0.01) AND LOWER PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS SUCH AS DEPRESSION (P<0.01) COMPARED TO THOSE WHO WERE ONLY MARGINALLY/MODERATELY YOGA-INVOLVED OR WHO WERE IN THE GYMNASTICS CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LITERATURE, YOGA PRACTICE MIGHT HAVE ITS BIGGEST IMPACT ON MENTAL HEALTH WHEN IT IS PART OF A PRACTITIONER'S WORLDVIEW. FURTHER RESEARCH FOCUSING ON THE IMPACT OF YOGA INVOLVEMENT IN CLINICAL GROUPS IS ENCOURAGED.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
2 1874  43 RAPID STRESS REDUCTION AND ANXIOLYSIS AMONG DISTRESSED WOMEN AS A CONSEQUENCE OF A THREE-MONTH INTENSIVE YOGA PROGRAM. BACKGROUND: EMOTIONAL DISTRESS IS AN INCREASING PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM AND HATHA YOGA HAS BEEN CLAIMED TO INDUCE STRESS REDUCTION AND EMPOWERMENT IN PRACTICING SUBJECTS. WE AIMED TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF IYENGAR HATHA YOGA ON PERCEIVED STRESS AND ASSOCIATED PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES IN MENTALLY DISTRESSED WOMEN. MATERIAL/METHODS: A CONTROLLED PROSPECTIVE NON-RANDOMIZED STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN 24 SELF-REFERRED FEMALE SUBJECTS (MEAN AGE 37.9+/-7.3 YEARS) WHO PERCEIVED THEMSELVES AS EMOTIONALLY DISTRESSED. SUBJECTS WERE OFFERED PARTICIPATION IN ONE OF TWO SUBSEQUENTIAL 3-MONTHS YOGA PROGRAMS. GROUP 1 (N=16) PARTICIPATED IN THE FIRST CLASS, GROUP 2 (N=8) SERVED AS A WAITING LIST CONTROL. DURING THE YOGA COURSE, SUBJECTS ATTENDED TWO-WEEKLY 90-MIN IYENGAR YOGA CLASSES. OUTCOME WAS ASSESSED ON ENTRY AND AFTER 3 MONTHS BY COHEN PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE, STATE-TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY, PROFILE OF MOOD STATES, CESD-DEPRESSION SCALE, BF-S/BF-S' WELL-BEING SCALES, FREIBURG COMPLAINT LIST AND RATINGS OF PHYSICAL WELL-BEING. SALIVARY CORTISOL LEVELS WERE MEASURED BEFORE AND AFTER AN EVENING YOGA CLASS IN A SECOND SAMPLE. RESULTS: COMPARED TO WAITING-LIST, WOMEN WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE YOGA-TRAINING DEMONSTRATED PRONOUNCED AND SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN PERCEIVED STRESS (P<0.02), STATE AND TRAIT ANXIETY (P<0.02 AND P<0.01, RESPECTIVELY), WELL-BEING (P<0.01), VIGOR (P<0.02), FATIGUE (P<0.02) AND DEPRESSION (P<0.05). PHYSICAL WELL-BEING ALSO INCREASED (P<0.01), AND THOSE SUBJECTS SUFFERING FROM HEADACHE OR BACK PAIN REPORTED MARKED PAIN RELIEF. SALIVARY CORTISOL DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER PARTICIPATION IN A YOGA CLASS (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: WOMEN SUFFERING FROM MENTAL DISTRESS PARTICIPATING IN A 3-MONTH IYENGAR YOGA CLASS SHOW SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS ON MEASURES OF STRESS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES. FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF YOGA WITH RESPECT TO PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF STRESS-RELATED DISEASE AND OF UNDERLYING MECHANISM IS WARRANTED.	2005	
                                                                
3  110  27 A PILOT STUDY MEASURING THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON THE TRAIT OF MINDFULNESS. BACKGROUND: THE CURRENT STUDY EXAMINED WHETHER YOGA WOULD INCREASE LEVELS OF MINDFULNESS IN A HEALTHY POPULATION. METHOD: FORTY-SIX PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP OR A WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP. MINDFULNESS WAS ASSESSED PRE AND POST YOGA, USING THE FREIBURG MINDFULNESS INVENTORY (FMI). RESULTS: RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE YOGA GROUP EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OVERALL MINDFULNESS, AND IN THREE MINDFULNESS SUBSCALES; ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT MOMENT, ACCEPTING AND OPEN ATTITUDES TOWARD EXPERIENCE, AND INSIGHTFUL UNDERSTANDING (P < .01). THE CONTROL GROUP EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OVERALL MINDFULNESS (P < .02) AND INSIGHTFUL UNDERSTANDING (P < .01). FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT A YOGA INTERVENTION MAY BE A VIABLE METHOD FOR INCREASING LEVELS OF TRAIT MINDFULNESS IN A HEALTHY POPULATION, POTENTIALLY IMPLICATING YOGA AS A PREVENTIVE METHOD FOR THE LATER DEVELOPMENT OF NEGATIVE EMOTIONAL MOOD STATES (I.E. ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION). THE CONTROL GROUP ALSO EXPERIENCED MODERATE ELEVATIONS OF MINDFULNESS AT THE SECOND ASSESSMENT.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
4  843  38 EFFECT OF YOGA ON PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONING OF NURSING STUDENTS: A RANDOMIZED WAIT LIST CONTROL TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: NURSING STUDENTS EXPERIENCE CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF STRESS TO MEET THEIR PROFESSIONAL DEMANDS. YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE PRACTICE TO REDUCE STRESS AND IMPROVE PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL BEING. HOWEVER, IMPROVEMENT IN PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL BEING AIDS IN STRESS MANAGEMENT. AIM: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF EIGHT WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION ON PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONING OF NURSING STUDENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIS WAS A RANDOMISED WAIT LIST CONTROL (WLC) TRIAL, WE RECRUITED TOTAL 100 STUDENTS FROM KEMPEGOWDA INSTITUTE OF NURSING, BENGALURU, KARNATAKA, INDIA AND RANDOMIZED THEM INTO TWO GROUPS (YOGA=50 AND WLC=50 STUDENTS). THE FOLLOWING INSTRUMENTS WERE USED TO COLLECT THE DATA, FREIBURG MINDFULNESS INVENTORY (FMI), SELF-COMPASSION SCALE- SHORT FORM (SCS-SF), CONNOR-DAVIDSON RESILIENCE SCALE (CD-RISC), SATISFACTION WITH LIFE SCALE (SWLS), JEFFERSON SCALE OF EMPATHY HPS-VERSION (JSE-HPS), AND PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE (PSS). DATA WAS ANALYSED USING REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (RM-ANOVA) FOLLOWED BY POST-HOC BONFERRONI CORRECTION FOR ALL PSYCHOLOGICAL VARIABLES. RESULTS: THE RESULTS OF OUR STUDY REPORT THAT EIGHT WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING SELF COMPASSION AND MINDFULNESS AMONG NURSING STUDENTS IN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP THAN COMPARED TO WLC GROUP. EVEN THOUGH THERE WERE IMPROVEMENTS IN RESILIENCE, SATISFACTION IN LIFE AND PERCEIVED STRESS, RESULTS WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. CONCLUSION: OVERALL, RESULTS OF THE PRESENT STUDY HAVE DEMONSTRATED IMPACT OF EIGHT WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONING OF NURSING STUDENTS. YOGA INTERVENTION CAN BE INCULCATED IN THE NURSING EDUCATION TO MEET DEMANDS OF THE PROFESSION.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
5 2920  54 [THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOGA IMMERSION, PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING AND PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS]. BACKGROUND: IN RECENT YEARS POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA (AS A KIND OF SPIRITUAL EXERCISE) IN REGARDS TO SUBJECTIVE WELL-BEING AND PHYSICAL HEALTH CAN BE FOUND AS WELL DOCUMENTED IN THE LITERATURE. METHOD: BASED ON A CONSTRUCT-PSYCHOLOGICAL APPROACH A NEWLY DEVELOPED SCALE FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF YOGA INVOLVEMENT (IMMERSION) WAS VALIDATED ON A SAMPLE OF 233 NON-CLINICAL SUBJECTS (210 FEMALES) BY MEANS OF SOCIO-DEMOGRAPHIC AND WELL ESTABLISHED PSYCHOMETRIC PARAMETERS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING AND PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS. FURTHERMORE, THE GROUP OF YOGA PRACTITIONERS WAS COMPARED WITH A CONTROL GROUP CONSISTING OF 93 GYMNASTICS PRACTITIONERS (83 WOMEN) WITH RESPECT TO THESE PARAMETERS. RESULTS: THE AMOUNT OF YOGA IMMERSION (YI) CAN BE RELIABLY ASSESSED BY MEANS OF THE ONE-DIMENSIONAL YI-SCALE (10 ITEMS) AND SHOWS TO BE STRONGLY CORRELATED WITH MINDFULNESS (R = .56; P < .01), INNER CORRESPONDENCE (R = .61; P < .01) AND RELIGIOUS/SPIRITUAL WELL-BEING (R = .68; P < .01). FURTHERMORE HIGHLY YOGA-IMMERSIVE PRACTITIONERS EXHIBITED A SIGNIFICANT HIGHER AMOUNT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL-BEING (P < .01) COMPARED TO MARGINALLY/MODERATELY YOGA-IMMERSIVE AND GYMNASTICS PRACTITIONERS. THE YOGA-GROUP ALSO SHOWED A LOWER AMOUNT OF PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS (E.G. DEPRESSION; P < .01). CONCLUSIONS: THE GLOBALLY POSTULATED POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOGA-PRACTICING AND MENTAL HEALTH COULD BE CONFIRMED; THEREBY THE IMPACT OF YI CAN BE ASSUMED AS CENTRAL. FURTHER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL RESEARCH FOCUSING ON THE HEALTH/DISEASE-RELATED ASPECTS OF YI MIGHT BE CONDUCTED ESPECIALLY IN CLINICAL GROUPS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
6 2322  29 TREATMENT OF CHRONIC LOWER BACK PAIN: STUDY PROTOCOL OF A COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS STUDY ON YOGA, EURYTHMY THERAPY, AND PHYSIOTHERAPEUTIC EXERCISES. BACKGROUND: WE AIM TO COMPARE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF 3 ACTIVE INTERVENTIONS, I.E., YOGA, EURYTHMY THERAPY, AND PHYSIOTHERAPEUTIC EXERCISE, ON CHRONIC LOWER BACK PAIN. METHODS: IN THIS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OVER 16 WEEKS (8 WEEKS OF INTERVENTION, 8 WEEKS OF FOLLOW-UP), DATA OF INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC LOWER BACK PAIN WILL BE ANALYZED. INTERVENTIONS ARE IMPLEMENTED AS GROUP SESSIONS (75 MIN) ONCE PER WEEK. PARTICIPANTS RECEIVE A MANUAL FOR HOME-BASED PRACTICE AND ARE ASSESSED BEFORE AND AT THE END OF THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION PERIOD, AND AT THE END OF AN 8-WEEK FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. STANDARDIZED QUESTIONNAIRES ARE: THE ROLAND-MORRIS DISABILITY SCORE, VISUAL ANALOG SCALES MEASURING INTENSITY OF PAIN, THE BRIEF MULTIDIMENSIONAL LIFE SATISFACTION SCALE, THE PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE, THE INNER CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE PRACTICES QUESTIONNAIRE, THE FREIBURG MINDFULNESS QUESTIONNAIRE, THE GENERAL SELF-EFFICACY SCALE, A SELF-REGULATION QUESTIONNAIRE, THE INTERNAL COHERENCE SCALE, A PAIN DIARY (REGISTERING THE NEED OF ANALGESIC MEDICATION), AND A QUESTIONNAIRE ON THE PATIENTS' EXPECTATION THAT THE INTERVENTIONS WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING PAIN AND HOW STRONG THIS REDUCTION MIGHT BE (2 SINGLE ITEMS), ETC. DISCUSSION: THIS LARGE MULTICENTER STUDY WILL PROVIDE EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF 3 CONTRASTING MOVEMENT-ORIENTATED TREATMENTS THAT SHARE SOME SIMILARITIES BUT DIFFER IN ESSENTIAL DETAILS: YOGA, EURYTHMY THERAPY, AND PHYSIOTHERAPEUTIC EXERCISES. IT WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT DATA ON NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL OPTIONS TO TREAT LOWER BACK PAIN IN A LARGE GROUP OF AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
7 1330  33 HOLISTIC NURSING IN PRACTICE: MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION TO MANAGE STRESS AND BURNOUT. PURPOSE: EFFECTS OF A MINDFULNESS-BASED (MB) YOGA PRACTICE ON STRESS, BURNOUT, AND INDICATORS OF WELL-BEING AMONG NURSES AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (HCPS). DESIGN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, 80 HCPS ASSIGNED TO EITHER MB YOGA INTERVENTION OR CONTROL GROUP. METHOD: THE MB YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 41) ATTENDED WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES AND PRACTICED YOGA INDEPENDENTLY. THE CONTROL GROUP (N = 39) DID NOT RECEIVE THE YOGA INTERVENTION. STUDY PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED PRE- AND POSTINTERVENTION QUESTIONNAIRES, INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED (A) PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE; (B) MASLACH BURNOUT INVENTORY; (C) VITALITY SUBSCALE OF THE MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY SHORT FORM-36; (D) GLOBAL SLEEP QUALITY ITEM, (E) MINDFULNESS AWARENESS SURVEY, AND (F) SUBSCALE OF THE BRIEF SERENITY SCALE. DIURNAL SALIVARY CORTISOL AND BLOOD PRESSURE WERE ASSESSED PRE AND POSTINTERVENTION. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS (P < .01) NOTED IN MB YOGA COMPARED WITH CONTROL FOR SELF-REPORTED FACTORS, INCLUDING STRESS (PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE), BURNOUT (MASLACH BURNOUT INVENTORY), VITALITY (MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY SHORT FORM-36), SLEEP (GSQ), SERENITY/INNER HAVEN (IH), AND MINDFULNESS (MINDFULNESS AWARENESS SURVEY). DIURNAL CORTISOL SLOPES AND BLOOD PRESSURE WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED. CONCLUSION: THE MB YOGA INTERVENTION HAD A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF NURSES AND HCPS, MOST SPECIFICALLY FOR MEASURES OF STRESS; PERCEIVED STRESS, BURNOUT, VITALITY, SLEEP QUALITY, SERENITY, AND MINDFULNESS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
8 1372  30 IMPACT OF A YOGA AND MEDITATION INTERVENTION ON STUDENTS' STRESS AND ANXIETY LEVELS. OBJECTIVE. TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF A SIX-WEEK YOGA AND MEDITATION INTERVENTION ON COLLEGE STUDENTS' STRESS PERCEPTION, ANXIETY LEVELS, AND MINDFULNESS SKILLS. METHODS. COLLEGE STUDENTS PARTICIPATED IN A SIX-WEEK PILOT PROGRAM THAT CONSISTED OF A 60-MINUTE VINYASA FLOW YOGA CLASS ONCE WEEKLY, FOLLOWED BY GUIDED MEDITATION DELIVERED BY TRAINED FACULTY MEMBERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND COLLEGE OF PHARMACY. STUDENTS COMPLETED PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION QUESTIONNAIRES TO EVALUATE CHANGES IN THE FOLLOWING OUTCOMES: STRESS LEVELS, ANXIETY LEVELS, AND MINDFULNESS SKILLS. THE QUESTIONNAIRE CONSISTED OF THREE SELF-REPORTING TOOLS: THE BECK ANXIETY INVENTORY (BAI), THE PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE (PSS), AND THE FIVE FACET MINDFULNESS QUESTIONNAIRE (FFMQ). STUDENTS' SCORES ON EACH WERE ASSESSED TO DETECT ANY CHANGES FROM BASELINE USING THE NUMERICAL AND CATEGORICAL SCALES (LOW, MEDIUM, AND HIGH) FOR EACH INSTRUMENT. RESULTS. SEVENTEEN PARTICIPANTS, AGED 19 TO 23 YEARS, COMPLETED THE STUDY. THIRTEEN PARTICIPANTS WERE FEMALE AND FOUR WERE MALE. NINE OF THE STUDENTS WERE ENROLLED IN THE DOCTOR OF PHARMACY PROGRAM AND EIGHT WERE ENROLLED IN OTHER ACADEMIC PROGRAMS. STUDENTS' ANXIETY AND STRESS SCORES DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY WHILE THEIR TOTAL MINDFULNESS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. CHANGES IN CATEGORICAL DATA FROM PRE- TO POST-INTERVENTION ON THE BAI AND PSS WERE SIGNIFICANT, WITH NO STUDENTS SCORING IN THE "HIGH" CATEGORY FOR STRESS OR ANXIETY ON THE POST-INTERVENTION QUESTIONNAIRE. CONCLUSION. STUDENTS EXPERIENCED A REDUCTION IN STRESS AND ANXIETY LEVELS AFTER COMPLETING A SIX-WEEK YOGA AND MEDITATION PROGRAM PRECEDING FINAL EXAMINATIONS. RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ADOPTING A MINDFULNESS PRACTICE FOR AS LITTLE AS ONCE PER WEEK MAY REDUCE STRESS AND ANXIETY IN COLLEGE STUDENTS. ADMINISTRATORS SHOULD CONSIDER INCLUDING INSTRUCTION IN NONPHARMACOLOGIC STRESS AND ANXIETY REDUCTION METHODS, WITHIN CURRICULA IN ORDER TO SUPPORT STUDENT SELF-CARE.	2019	
                                                                                                     
9 1467  28 INNER CORRESPONDENCE AND PEACEFULNESS WITH PRACTICES AMONG PARTICIPANTS IN EURYTHMY THERAPY AND YOGA: A VALIDATION STUDY. SEVERAL MIND BODY MEDICINE INTERVENTIONS REQUIRE AN ACTIVE PARTICIPATION OF THE PRACTITIONERS. WE INTENDED TO DEVELOP A QUESTIONNAIRE TO OPERATIONALIZE AND MEASURE THE "INNER CORRESPONDENCE" OF INDIVIDUALS PRACTICING YOGA OR EURYTHMY THERAPY. IN AN ANONYMOUS CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY WE ENROLLED 501 INDIVIDUALS (61% YOGA). EXPLORATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS (STUDY 1) OF THE 12-ITEM INSTRUMENT (CRONBACH'S ALPHA = .84) POINTED TO A 3-FACTOR SOLUTION, WITH ONE MAJOR SCALE AND GOOD INTERNAL CONSISTENCY (ALPHA = .83) AND TWO MINOR SCALES WITH WEAK INTERNAL CONSISTENCY. TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF THE MAIN SCALE, WE ADDED 8 NEW ITEMS WHICH WERE TESTED IN A SAMPLE OF 135 INDIVIDUALS (STUDY 2: 71% YOGA). FACTOR ANALYSIS CONFIRMED A 12-ITEM SINGLE FACTOR (ALPHA = .95), THAT IS, INNER CORRESPONDENCE/PEACEFUL HARMONY WITH PRACTICES (ICPH). THE SCALE CORRELATED STRONGLY WITH MINDFULNESS (FMI; R > .50), MODERATELY WITH LIFE AND PATIENT SATISFACTION (BMLSS; R BETWEEN .32 AND .43), AND WEAKLY NEGATIVE WITH SYMPTOM SCORE (VAS; R = -.23). IN CONCLUSION, THE SCALE ICPH WAS CONFIRMED AS A RELEVANT TOOL TO MEASURE THE INNER CORRESPONDENCE AND FEELINGS OF PEACEFULNESS WITH PRACTICES. IT CAN BE USED IN CLINICAL STUDIES TO ASSESS THE EFFICACY OF MIND-BODY PRACTICES INVOLVING PHYSICAL MOVEMENTS.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
10 1428  39 IMPROVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING FOLLOWING A BRIEF YOGA-BASED PROGRAM FOR EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS WHO ATTENDED A YOGA-BASED PROGRAM. METHODS: EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS WHO ATTENDED A 3-DAY YOGA-BASED RISE (RESILIENCE, INTEGRATION, SELF-AWARENESS, ENGAGEMENT) PROGRAM WERE RECRUITED TO PARTICIPATE. RISE WAS ADMINISTERED AT THE KRIPALU CENTER FOR YOGA & HEALTH. MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING, AND HEALTH-RELATED BEHAVIORS WERE COMPLETED BEFORE (BASELINE), AFTER (POST), AND 2 MONTHS AFTER RISE (FOLLOW-UP). FORTY-FOUR PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED BASELINE AND POST AND WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. OF THOSE, 33 PARTICIPANTS ALSO COMPLETED THE FOLLOW-UP. PAIRED SAMPLES T TESTS WERE USED TO COMPARE SCORES BETWEEN TIME POINTS. RESULTS: COMPARED TO BASELINE, AT POST, PARTICIPANTS SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS IN PERCEIVED STRESS, MINDFULNESS, EMPOWERMENT, POSITIVE AFFECT, NEGATIVE AFFECT, SELF-COMPASSION, TOTAL WORK ENGAGEMENT, VIGOR, SLEEP QUALITY (ALL P VALUES < .001), RESILIENCE, SATISFACTION WITH LIFE, AS WELL AS EXHAUSTION AND PROFESSIONAL EFFICACY WHICH ARE DIMENSIONS OF BURNOUT (ALL P VALUES < .01). AT THE FOLLOW-UP, SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE MAINTAINED FOR MINDFULNESS, EMPOWERMENT, SELF-COMPASSION, SLEEP QUALITY (ALL P VALUES < .001), RESILIENCE, VIGOR, AND EXHAUSTION (ALL P VALUES < .01) AND POSITIVE AFFECT, SATISFACTION WITH LIFE, AND WORK ENGAGEMENT (ALL P VALUES < .05). CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE YOGA-BASED RISE PROGRAM IMPROVES PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELL-BEING IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS. IN ADDITION, PARTICIPANTS REPORTED THAT ATTENDING RISE WAS FEASIBLE, THEY COULD CONTINUE USING RISE PRACTICES LONG-TERM, SHARED THEM WITH WORK COLLEAGUES, AND REPORTED THAT RISE POSITIVELY IMPACTED BOTH THEIR DAILY LIVES AND WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT. WITH THESE PROMISING RESULTS, ADDITIONAL CONTROLLED RESEARCH IS WARRANTED.	2019	
                                                                                                            
11 1367  25 IMPACT OF A MINDFULNESS-BASED, WORKPLACE GROUP YOGA INTERVENTION ON BURNOUT, SELF-CARE, AND COMPASSION IN HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER A WORKPLACE, GROUP MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION COULD HELP MANAGE BURNOUT AND IMPROVE WELLBEING AMONG HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS. METHODS: A TOTAL OF 43 HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS PARTICIPATED IN 8-WEEK SUPERVISED WORKPLACE, GROUP MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA ACTIVITIES. THE AUTHORS USED A SINGLE-SAMPLE, PRE-POST DESIGN. AT TWO POINTS IN TIME (BASELINE AND POSTINTERVENTION), PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED A SET OF ONLINE MEASURES ASSESSING BURNOUT, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, STRESS, RESILIENCE, AND COMPASSION. THE AUTHORS USED LINEAR MIXED MODEL ANALYSIS TO ASSESS CHANGES IN OUTCOME MEASURES. RESULTS: PARTICIPANTS HAD IMPROVEMENTS AFTER THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION. AT POSTINTERVENTION, THEY HAD SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER SCORES ON PERSONAL ACCOMPLISHMENT, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, STRESS, PERCEIVED RESILIENCE, AND COMPASSION. PARTICIPANTS HAD A POSITIVE PERCEPTION OF THE YOGA INTERVENTION. CONCLUSION: GROUP MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA PROGRAM MAY BE CONVENIENT AND LOW-COST APPROACH TO SUPPORT HEALTH AND WELLBEING AMONG HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
12  130  32 A PRAGMATIC CONTROLLED TRIAL OF A BRIEF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED PROGRAM FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS. OBJECTIVES: TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELLBEING IN EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS THAT ATTENDED A BRIEF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED PROGRAM. DESIGN: PRAGMATIC CONTROLLED TRIAL COMPARING EDUCATION PROFESSIONALS THAT ATTENDED A YOGA MINDFULNESS-BASED PROGRAM (N = 9) TO A WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 22). SETTING: THE 3-DAY PROGRAM WAS DELIVERED AT THE KRIPALU CENTER FOR YOGA & HEALTH IN MASSACHUSETTS. INTERVENTION: THE 3-DAY YOGA MINDFULNESS PROGRAM INCLUDED 5 HOURS PER DAY OF YOGA, MINDFULNESS EXERCISES, FORMAL MEDITATION, DIDACTIC, AND EXPERIENTIAL ACTIVITIES. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: MEASURES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELLBEING WERE COMPLETED BEFORE (BASELINE), IMMEDIATELY AFTER (POST-PROGRAM), AND TWO MONTHS AFTER THE PROGRAM (FOLLOW-UP). RESULTS: RELATIVE TO CONTROLS (N = 21), THE RISE GROUP (N = 9) SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN POSITIVE AFFECT (P = .033), NEGATIVE AFFECT (P = .044), MINDFULNESS (P = .001), EMPOWERMENT (P = .022), SELF-COMPASSION (P = .001), AND WORK ENGAGEMENT FROM BASELINE TO POST-PROGRAM. FROM BASELINE TO FOLLOW-UP, THE RISE GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN STRESS (P = .008), NEGATIVE AFFECT (P = .013), MINDFULNESS (P = .001), EMPOWERMENT (P = .007), AND SELF-COMPASSION (P = .001) COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: THE YOGA MINDFULNESS PROGRAM WAS ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN EDUCATORS' PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL WELLBEING IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING AND 2-MONTHS FOLLOWING THE PROGRAM. FUTURE RESEARCH WITH A LARGER SAMPLE SIZE IS NEEDED TO CONFIRM THESE RESULTS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
13 1177  26 EVALUATION OF SIDDHA SAMADHI YOGA FOR ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS: A PRELIMINARY STUDY. SIDDHA SAMADHI YOGA IS A PROGRAM IN WHICH MEDITATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH PRANAYAMA (BREATHING EXERCISES). 22 VOLUNTEERS WITH ANXIETY COMPLAINTS (M AGE = 42.8 YR., SD = 10.3) WERE ASSIGNED TO TWO GROUPS: 14 ATTENDED THE YOGA GROUP, AND 8 ATTENDED A WAITING-LIST OR CONTROL GROUP. THEY WERE EVALUATED BEFORE THE INTERVENTION AND 1 MONTH AFTER IT ON THE STATE-TRAIT ANXIETY INVENTORY, THE BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY, TENSION FEELINGS SELF-EVALUATION SCALES, AND THE WELL-BEING SELF-EVALUATION SCALES. A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN SCORES ON ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND TENSION WAS FOUND IN YOGA GROUP, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN WELL-BEING IN COMPARISON WITH THE CONTROL GROUP.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
14 1336  31 HOW DOES YOGA REDUCE STRESS? A CLINICAL TRIAL TESTING PSYCHOLOGICAL MECHANISMS. YOGA INTERVENTIONS CAN REDUCE STRESS, BUT THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THAT STRESS REDUCTION REMAIN LARGELY UNIDENTIFIED. UNDERSTANDING HOW YOGA WORKS IS ESSENTIAL TO OPTIMIZING INTERVENTIONS. THE PRESENT STUDY TESTED FIVE POTENTIAL PSYCHOSOCIAL MECHANISMS (INCREASED MINDFULNESS, INTEROCEPTIVE AWARENESS, SPIRITUAL WELL-BEING, SELF-COMPASSION AND SELF-CONTROL) THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO EXPLAIN YOGA'S IMPACT ON STRESS. FORTY-TWO PARTICIPANTS (62% FEMALE; 64% WHITE) IN A YOGA PROGRAM FOR STRESS REDUCTION COMPLETED SURVEYS AT BASELINE (T1), MID-INTERVENTION (T2) AND POST-INTERVENTION (12 WEEKS; T3). WE MEASURED TWO ASPECTS OF STRESS, PERCEIVED STRESS AND STRESS REACTIVITY. CHANGES WERE ASSESSED WITH PAIRED T-TESTS; ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN CHANGES IN MECHANISMS WERE TESTED IN RESIDUAL CHANGE MODELS. ONLY STRESS REACTIVITY DECREASED, ON AVERAGE, FROM T1 TO T3. EXCEPT FOR SELF-COMPASSION, ALL PSYCHOSOCIAL MECHANISMS INCREASED FROM T1 TO T3, WITH MINIMAL CHANGES FROM T2 TO T3. EXCEPT FOR SELF-CONTROL, INCREASES IN EACH MECHANISM WERE STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASES IN BOTH MEASURES OF STRESS BETWEEN T1 AND T2 AND DECREASES IN PERCEIVED STRESS FROM T1 TO T3 (ALL P'S < 0.05). INCREASED PSYCHOSOCIAL RESOURCES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH STRESS REDUCTION. YOGA INTERVENTIONS TARGETING THESE RESOURCES MAY SHOW STRONGER STRESS REDUCTION EFFECTS. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD TEST THESE LINKAGES MORE RIGOROUSLY USING ACTIVE COMPARISON GROUPS AND LARGER SAMPLES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
15 1505  27 IREST YOGA-NIDRA ON THE COLLEGE CAMPUS: CHANGES IN STRESS, DEPRESSION, WORRY, AND MINDFULNESS. OBJECTIVES: THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT YOGA PRACTICE IS ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED STRESS, WORRY, AND DEPRESSION, AND WITH IMPROVED MINDFULNESS-BASED SKILLS. THESE FINDINGS HAD NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY REPLICATED FOR A SAMPLE OF COLLEGE STUDENTS. THIS STUDY EVALUATED WHETHER IREST YOGA-NIDRA PRACTICE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED PERCEIVED STRESS, WORRY, AND DEPRESSION, AND INCREASED MINDFULNESS IN A SAMPLE OF COLLEGE STUDENT S. METHODS: SIXTY-SIX STUDENTS AGE 18-56 COMPLETED AN 8-WEEK IREST YOGA-NIDRA INTERVENTION THAT WAS OFFERED FOR 8 SEMESTERS. ASSESSMENT OCCURRED 1 WEEK PRIOR TO INTERVENTION ONSET AND DURING THE CLASS PERIOD FOLLOWING THE INTERVENTION. QUALITATIVE DATA WERE COLLECTED AT WEEKS 4 AND 8. RESULTS: STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT PRE- TO POSTTEST IMPROVEMENTS IN PERCEIVED STRESS, WORRY, AND DEPRESSION WERE FOUND. PRE-EXISTING DEPRESSION ACCOUNTED FOR MOST OF THE CHANGE IN WORRY AND PERCEIVED STRESS SCORES. PRE- TO POST TEST IMPROVEMENTS IN MINDFULNESS-BASED SKILLS WERE ALSO DETECTED. CONCLUSIONS: IREST YOGA-NIDRA PRACTICE MAY REDUCE SYMPTOMS OF PERCEIVED STRESS, WORRY, AND DEPRESSION AND INCREASE MINDFULNESS-BASED SKILLS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
16   96  25 A NATURALISTIC STUDY OF YOGA, MEDITATION, SELF-PERCEIVED STRESS, SELF-COMPASSION, AND MINDFULNESS IN COLLEGE STUDENTS. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY COMPARED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS MEDITATION ON SELF-COMPASSION, MINDFULNESS, AND PERCEIVED STRESS IN COLLEGE STUDENTS; AND EXPLORED MIND-BODY MECHANISMS AND PREDICTORS OF STRESS REDUCTION. PARTICIPANTS: STUDENT PARTICIPANTS (N = 92) WERE ENROLLED IN EITHER YOGA OR MINDFULNESS MEDITATION CLASSES AT A COLLEGE IN THE SOUTHERN UNITED STATES FROM AUGUST THROUGH MAY OF 2015-2016. METHODS: STUDENTS PARTICIPATED IN 50-MINUTE CLASSES TWICE A WEEK FOR 10 WEEKS, COMPLETING SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES DURING THE 1ST AND 10TH WEEK. RESULTS: MULTIPLE-LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS FOUND CHANGE IN SELF-COMPASSION WAS THE STRONGEST PREDICTOR OF STRESS REDUCTION. CONCLUSIONS: INCREASING SELF-COMPASSION MAY INCREASE THE EFFICACY OF MIND-BODY INTERVENTIONS. RESEARCH INTO MIND-BODY MECHANISMS IS NEEDED TO IDENTIFY INTERVENTION COMPONENTS THAT MOST IMPROVE STUDENT WELL-BEING.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
17 1371  37 IMPACT OF A YIN YOGA AND MEDITATION INTERVENTION ON PHARMACY FACULTY AND STUDENT WELL-BEING. BACKGROUND: STUDENT PHARMACISTS AND FACULTY EXHIBIT HIGH LEVELS OF STRESS, INDEPENDENT OF THE CURRENT CORONAVIRUS 2019 PANDEMIC, AND THEIR PATH TOWARD WELLNESS, INCLUDING A REDUCTION IN STRESS AND ANXIETY, IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE. YOGA AND MEDITATION ARE PROVEN INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE STRESS AND ANXIETY AND INCREASE WELLNESS. YIN YOGA IS AN ADAPTABLE, QUIET PRACTICE IDEAL FOR THOSE LACKING PREVIOUS YOGA EXPERIENCE, FLEXIBILITY, AND TIME. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF A 6-WEEK YIN YOGA AND MEDITATION INTERVENTION ON COLLEGE OF PHARMACY FACULTY AND STUDENTS' STRESS PERCEPTION, ANXIETY LEVELS, AND MINDFULNESS SKILLS. METHODS: FACULTY AND STUDENTS PARTICIPATED IN A 6-WEEK PILOT PROGRAM COMPRISING A ONCE-WEEKLY YIN YOGA CLASS FOLLOWED BY GUIDED MEDITATION. YIN YOGA WAS SELECTED FOR ITS QUIET MEDITATIVE STYLE. PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED A PRE- AND POSTQUESTIONNAIRE AT 6 WEEKS AND 3 AND 6 MONTHS TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN PERCEIVED STRESS SCORES, ANXIETY SCORES, AND MINDFULNESS SKILLS. THE QUESTIONNAIRE WAS COMPOSED OF 3 SELF-REPORTING TOOLS: BECK ANXIETY INVENTORY (BAI), PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE, AND THE FIVE FACET MINDFULNESS QUESTIONNAIRE. RESULTS: TWENTY PARTICIPANTS, 12 STUDENTS AND 8 FACULTY (AGES 18-66 YEARS), COMPLETED THE STUDY. ANXIETY AND STRESS SCORES DECREASED, AND MINDFULNESS INCREASED AT 6 WEEKS, 3 MONTHS AND 6 MONTHS, WITH ALL CHANGES REACHING STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. NO PARTICIPANTS REPORTED BEING IN THE "HIGH" CATEGORY OF ANXIETY AFTER INTERVENTION USING BAI CATEGORICAL DATA, ALTHOUGH THIS FINDING WAS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. CONCLUSION: FACULTY AND STUDENTS DEMONSTRATED A REDUCTION IN STRESS AND ANXIETY LEVELS AND AN INCREASE IN MINDFULNESS AFTER A 6-WEEK YIN YOGA AND MEDITATION PROGRAM. OUTCOMES SUGGEST THAT INCLUSION OF AN ADAPTABLE, MEDITATIVE PRACTICE, WHICH MAY EASILY BE REPLICATED AT HOME, FOR AS LITTLE AS ONCE PER WEEK FOR 6 WEEKS MAY REDUCE STRESS AND ANXIETY AND INCREASE MINDFULNESS LONG TERM. CREATING A CULTURE OF WELLNESS SHOULD BE A PRIORITY FOR ALL COLLEGES OF PHARMACY.	2021	

18 1527  35 IYENGAR YOGA FOR DISTRESSED WOMEN: A 3-ARMED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. DISTRESS IS AN INCREASING PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM. WE AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF AN IYENGAR YOGA PROGRAM ON PERCEIVED STRESS AND PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES IN DISTRESSED WOMEN AND EVALUATED A POTENTIAL DOSE-EFFECT RELATIONSHIP. SEVENTY-TWO FEMALE DISTRESSED SUBJECTS WERE INCLUDED INTO A 3-ARMED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL AND ALLOCATED TO YOGA GROUP 1 (N = 24) WITH TWELVE 90 MIN SESSIONS OVER 3 MONTHS, YOGA GROUP 2 (N = 24) WITH 24 SESSIONS OVER 3 MONTHS, OR A WAITING LIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 24). THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS STRESS PERCEPTION, MEASURED BY COHEN STRESS SCALE; SECONDARY OUTCOMES INCLUDED STATE TRAIT ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), PROFILE OF MOOD STATES, WELL BEING, AND BODILY COMPLAINTS. AFTER THREE MONTHS, WOMEN IN THE YOGA GROUPS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN PERCEIVED STRESS (P = 0.003), STATE TRAIT ANXIETY (P = 0.021 AND P = 0.003), DEPRESSION (P = 0.008), PSYCHOLOGICAL QOL (P = 0.012), MOOD STATES BEING (P = 0.007), AND BODILY COMPLAINTS WELL(P = 0.012) WHEN COMPARED TO CONTROLS. BOTH YOGA PROGRAMS WERE SIMILARLY EFFECTIVE FOR THESE OUTCOMES; HOWEVER, COMPLIANCE WAS BETTER IN THE GROUP WITH FEWER SESSIONS (YOGA GROUP 1). DOSE EFFECTS WERE SEEN ONLY IN THE ANALYSIS OF GROUP-INDEPENDENT EFFECTS FOR BACK PAIN, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT IYENGAR YOGA EFFECTIVELY REDUCES DISTRESS AND IMPROVES RELATED PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL OUTCOMES. FURTHERMORE, ATTENDING TWICE-WEEKLY YOGA CLASSES WAS NOT SUPERIOR TO ONCE-WEEKLY CLASSES, AS A RESULT OF LIMITED COMPLIANCE IN THE TWICE-WEEKLY GROUP.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
19 1827  33 PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR FEMALE INMATES. FEMALE INMATES INVOLVED IN THE YOGA PRISON PROJECT AT TWO CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES IN SOUTH CAROLINA SERVED AS SUBJECTS. INMATES WERE SELECTED FROM THOSE WHO APPLIED TO PARTICIPATE IN A TEN-WEEK TRAUMA-FOCUSED YOGA PROGRAM. TO CREATE CONTROL AND EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS, INMATES WHO REQUESTED TO PARTICIPATE WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO BE IN THE CLASS (TREATMENT GROUP, N = 33) OR A WAITLIST (CONTROL GROUP, N = 17). INMATES ON THE WAITLIST SUBSEQUENTLY JOINED THE NEXT CLASS, SO ALL WHO APPLIED AND WERE ELIGIBLE PARTICIPATED IN A YOGA CLASS. MEASURES OF STRESS, DEPRESSION, SELF CONTROL, ANXIETY, SELF AWARENESS AND RUMINATION WERE USED AND DATA WAS COLLECTED FROM BOTH GROUPS BEFORE THE INITIAL YOGA CLASS BEGAN AND AGAIN AT THE END, TEN WEEKS LATER. TO ASSESS THE CHANGES FROM PRE-INTERVENTION TO POST-INTERVENTION, MIXED DESIGN ANOVA TESTS WERE CONDUCTED. INMATES IN THE YOGA GROUP REPORTED SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN DEPRESSION AND STRESS AND IMPROVED SELF-AWARENESS. NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE FOUND ON MEASURES OF ANXIETY, RUMINATION AND SELF-CONTROL IN THE YOGA GROUPS. ALTHOUGH NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT, ANXIETY SCORES DID DECREASE AND SELF-CONTROL SCORES IMPROVED FOR THE YOGA GROUP, WHILE INMATES IN THE CONTROL GROUP REPORTED A WORSENING OR NO CHANGE ON THESE TWO MEASURES. NO CHANGES WERE FOUND IN RUMINATION LEVELS. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT YOGA IS A RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE INTERVENTION THAT COULD BENEFIT BOTH INMATES AND PRISON STAFF BY REDUCING SOME NEGATIVE BEHAVIORS AND POSSIBLY MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
20 2147  27 THE EFFECTS OF MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA DURING PREGNANCY ON MATERNAL PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL DISTRESS. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND LEVEL OF ACCEPTABILITY OF A MINDFUL YOGA INTERVENTION PROVIDED DURING PREGNANCY AND TO GATHER PRELIMINARY DATA ON THE EFFICACY OF THE INTERVENTION IN REDUCING DISTRESS. DESIGN: BASELINE AND POST-TREATMENT MEASURES EXAMINED STATE AND TRAIT ANXIETY, PERCEIVED STRESS, PAIN, AND MORNING SALIVARY CORTISOL IN A SINGLE TREATMENT GROUP. POSTINTERVENTION DATA ALSO INCLUDED PARTICIPANT EVALUATION OF THE INTERVENTION. SETTING: THE 7 WEEKS MINDFULNESS-BASED YOGA GROUP INTERVENTION COMBINED ELEMENTS OF IYENGAR YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION. PARTICIPANTS: SIXTEEN HEALTHY PREGNANT NULLIPAROUS WOMEN WITH SINGLETON PREGNANCIES BETWEEN 12 AND 32 WEEKS GESTATION AT THE TIME OF ENROLLMENT. METHODS: OUTCOMES WERE EVALUATED FROM PRE- TO POSTINTERVENTION AND BETWEEN SECOND AND THIRD TRIMESTERS WITH REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE AND POST HOC NONPARAMETRIC TESTS. RESULTS: WOMEN PRACTICING MINDFUL YOGA IN THEIR SECOND TRIMESTER REPORTED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN PHYSICAL PAIN FROM BASELINE TO POSTINTERVENTION COMPARED WITH WOMEN IN THE THIRD TRIMESTER WHOSE PAIN INCREASED. WOMEN IN THEIR THIRD TRIMESTER SHOWED GREATER REDUCTIONS IN PERCEIVED STRESS AND TRAIT ANXIETY. CONCLUSIONS: PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE SUPPORTS YOGA'S POTENTIAL EFFICACY IN THESE AREAS, PARTICULARLY IF STARTED EARLY IN THE PREGNANCY.	2009

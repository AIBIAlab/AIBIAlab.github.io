1 1158 163 ESTABLISHING KEY COMPONENTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS: A DELPHI SURVEY. BACKGROUND: EVIDENCE SUGGESTS YOGA IS A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, HETEROGENEITY IN THE COMPONENTS AND REPORTING OF CLINICAL YOGA TRIALS IMPEDES BOTH THE GENERALIZATION OF STUDY RESULTS AND THE REPLICATION OF STUDY PROTOCOLS. THE AIM OF THIS DELPHI SURVEY WAS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES OF HETEROGENEITY, BY DEVELOPING A LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS OF KEY COMPONENTS FOR THE DESIGN AND REPORTING OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS. METHODS: RECOGNISED EXPERTS INVOLVED IN THE DESIGN, CONDUCT, AND TEACHING OF YOGA FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS WERE IDENTIFIED FROM A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW, AND INVITED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DELPHI SURVEY. FORTY-ONE OF THE 58 EXPERTS CONTACTED, REPRESENTING SIX COUNTRIES, AGREED TO PARTICIPATE. A THREE-ROUND DELPHI WAS CONDUCTED VIA ELECTRONIC SURVEYS. ROUND 1 PRESENTED AN OPEN-ENDED QUESTION, ALLOWING PANELLISTS TO INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFY COMPONENTS THEY CONSIDERED KEY TO THE DESIGN AND REPORTING OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS. THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF ROUND 1 IDENTIFIED ITEMS FOR QUANTITATIVE RATING IN ROUND 2; ITEMS NOT REACHING CONSENSUS WERE FORWARDED TO ROUND 3 FOR RE-RATING. RESULTS: THIRTY-SIX PANELLISTS (36/41; 88%) COMPLETED THE THREE ROUNDS OF THE DELPHI SURVEY. PANELLISTS PROVIDED 348 COMMENTS TO THE ROUND 1 QUESTION. THESE COMMENTS WERE REDUCED TO 49 ITEMS, GROUPED UNDER FIVE THEMES, FOR RATING IN SUBSEQUENT ROUNDS. A PRIORI GROUP CONSENSUS OF >/=80% WAS REACHED ON 28 ITEMS RELATED TO FIVE THEMES CONCERNING DEFINING THE YOGA INTERVENTION, TYPES OF YOGA PRACTICES TO INCLUDE IN AN INTERVENTION, DELIVERY OF THE YOGA PROTOCOL, DOMAINS OF OUTCOME MEASURES, AND REPORTING OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS. ADDITIONALLY, A PRIORI CONSENSUS OF >/=50% WAS REACHED ON FIVE ITEMS RELATING TO MINIMUM VALUES FOR INTERVENTION PARAMETERS. CONCLUSIONS: EXPERT CONSENSUS HAS PROVIDED A NON-PRESCRIPTIVE REFERENCE LIST FOR THE DESIGN AND REPORTING OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS. IT IS ANTICIPATED FUTURE RESEARCH INCORPORATING THE DELPHI GUIDELINES WILL FACILITATE HIGH QUALITY INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH IN THIS FIELD, INCREASE HOMOGENEITY OF INTERVENTION COMPONENTS AND PARAMETERS, AND ENHANCE THE COMPARISON AND REPRODUCIBILITY OF RESEARCH INTO THE USE OF YOGA FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
2 2291  34 THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF MEDITATION, YOGA, AND MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR CHRONIC SYMPTOMS OF MILD TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC SYMPTOMS OF MILD TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (MTBI) VARY GREATLY AND ARE DIFFICULT TO TREAT; WE INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF MEDITATION, YOGA, AND MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS ON THIS TREATMENT GROUP. METHOD: SEARCH INCLUDED FOUR DATABASES, ALLOWING STUDIES OF ANY DESIGN CONTAINING PRE/POST OUTCOMES FOR MEDITATION, YOGA, OR MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS IN PEOPLE SUFFERING FROM BRAIN INJURY ACQUIRED BY MECHANICAL FORCE. ANALYSES USED ROBUST VARIANCE ESTIMATION TO ASSESS OVERALL EFFECTS AND RANDOM-EFFECTS MODELS FOR SELECTED OUTCOMES; WE EVALUATED BOTH BETWEEN- AND WITHIN-GROUP CHANGES. RESULTS: TWENTY STUDIES (N = 539) WERE INCLUDED. RESULTS REVEALED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT OF OVERALL SYMPTOMS COMPARED TO CONTROLS (D = 0.41; 95% CI [0.04, 0.77]; TAU(2) = 0.06), WITH SIGNIFICANT WITHIN-GROUP IMPROVEMENTS IN MENTAL HEALTH (D = 0.39), PHYSICAL HEALTH (D = 0.39), COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE (D = 0.24), QUALITY OF LIFE (D = 0.39), AND SELF-RELATED PROCESSING (D = 0.38). SYMPTOMS SHOWING GREATEST IMPROVEMENT WERE FATIGUE (D = 0.96) AND DEPRESSION (D = 0.40). FINDINGS WERE HOMOGENEOUS ACROSS STUDIES. STUDY QUALITY CONCERNS INCLUDE LACK OF RANDOMISATION, BLINDING, AND RECORDING OF ADVERSE EVENTS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS FIRST-EVER META-ANALYSIS ON MEDITATION, YOGA, AND MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR CHRONIC SYMPTOMS OF MTBI OFFERS HOPE BUT HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR RIGOROUS NEW TRIALS TO ADVANCE CLINICAL APPLICATIONS AND TO EXPLORE MECHANISTIC PATHWAYS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
3  619  73 DEVELOPMENT OF THE CLARIFY (CHECKLIST STANDARDISING THE REPORTING OF INTERVENTIONS FOR YOGA) GUIDELINES: A DELPHI STUDY. BACKGROUND: THE USE OF YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC MODALITY IS INCREASING; HOWEVER, A LACK OF TRANSPARENT INTERVENTION REPORTING IS RESTRICTING THE DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF YOGA RESEARCH INTO CLINICAL AND COMMUNITY PRACTICE. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DEVELOP A YOGA-SPECIFIC REPORTING GUIDELINE AS AN EXTENSION TO EXISTING REPORTING GUIDELINES FOR RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS, OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES AND CASE REPORTS. METHODS: RECOGNISED INTERNATIONAL STAKEHOLDERS IN THE DESIGN AND CONDUCT OF YOGA RESEARCH WERE INVITED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE ELECTRONIC DELPHI SURVEY. A FOUR-ROUND DELPHI WAS CONDUCTED, WHEREBY PANELLISTS RATED SELECTED ITEMS FOR THEIR IMPORTANCE IN THE INCLUSION OF YOGA REPORTING GUIDELINES, ACCORDING TO A 5-STEP LIKERT SCALE. A PRIORI CONSENSUS FOR ITEM INCLUSION WAS AGREEMENT OF ITEMS AS 'VERY IMPORTANT' OR 'EXTREMELY IMPORTANT' BY >/=80% OF PANELLISTS. NON-CONSENSUS ITEMS WERE FORWARDED TO SUBSEQUENT ROUNDS FOR RE-RATING. RESULTS: 53 EXPERTS IN YOGA RESEARCH FROM 11 COUNTRIES, PRIMARILY IDENTIFYING AS RESEARCHERS (50%), ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS (18.8%) AND YOGA PROFESSIONALS (12.5%), CONSENTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DELPHI. OF THESE, 48 COMPLETED ROUND 1 (91%), 43 COMPLETED ROUND 2 (81%), 39 COMPLETED ROUND 3 (74%) AND 32 COMPLETED ROUND 4 (60%). PANELLISTS REACHED CONSENSUS FOR INCLUSION ON 21 ITEMS, GROUPED UNDER 10 DOMAINS REFLECTIVE OF MORE GENERIC INTERVENTION-BASED GUIDELINES. CONCLUSIONS: THE CONSENSUS-BASED 21-ITEM CLARIFY (CHECKLIST STANDARDISING THE REPORTING OF INTERVENTIONS FOR YOGA) CHECKLIST PROVIDES A MINIMUM REPORTING TEMPLATE FOR RESEARCHERS ACROSS A RANGE OF METHODOLOGY DESIGNS. USE OF THESE YOGA-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CLARIFY EXPLANATION AND ELABORATION GUIDELINES, WILL STANDARDISE THE MINIMUM LEVEL OF DETAIL REQUIRED FOR TRANSPARENT YOGA INTERVENTION, FACILITATING THE REPLICATION, DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF YOGA RESEARCH. ONGOING RESEARCH WILL ASSESS THE UPTAKE AND IMPACT OF CLARIFY, TO ENSURE THESE GUIDELINES RETAIN THEIR RELEVANCE TO THE INTERNATIONALLY GROWING FIELD OF YOGA RESEARCH.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
4  541  46 COMPONENTS AND REPORTING OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS. OBJECTIVES: TO IDENTIFY THE CONTENT AND REPORTING DETAILS OF RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS OF YOGA FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS THROUGH A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE. DESIGN: TWENTY ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE SEARCHED TO IDENTIFY RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA WERE FULL-TEXT, PEER REVIEWED ARTICLES, OF RCTS WITH YOGA AS A PRIMARY INTERVENTION, ON A POPULATION AGED 18 YEARS AND OVER, WITH A CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS OF A MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITION. DATA RELATING TO STUDY CHARACTERISTICS, YOGA STYLES, YOGA PRACTICES, HOME PRACTICE, AND REPORTING WERE EXTRACTED AND SUMMARISED. RESULTS: SEVENTEEN ARTICLES MET INCLUSION CRITERIA, REPRESENTING FIVE MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS: LOW BACK PAIN, OSTEOARTHRITIS, RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, KYPHOSIS, AND FIBROMYALGIA. 15 STUDIES WERE NON-RESIDENTIAL, AND TWO WERE RESIDENTIAL. STUDY DURATION RANGED FROM 1 TO 24 WEEKS; WEEKLY DOSAGE OF YOGA RANGED FROM 1 TO 56H. FIVE STYLES OF POSTURE-BASED HATHA YOGA WERE SPECIFIED. INTERVENTION CONTENT INCLUDED SEVEN YOGA PRACTISES: POSTURES, BREATHING, RELAXATION, MEDITATION, PHILOSOPHY, CHANTING, AND CLEANSING PRACTISES. TEN STUDIES EITHER ENCOURAGED OR REQUESTED HOME PRACTICE. REPORTING DETAILS INCLUDED CLASS PLANS, POSTURE LISTS, AND DIAGRAMS. DUE TO INSUFFICIENT DETAIL REGARDING DELIVERY OF THE YOGA INTERVENTION ONLY EIGHT OF THE 17 INTERVENTIONS WERE CONSIDERED REPLICABLE AS REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS: EVALUATION OF STUDY CHARACTERISTICS AND YOGA COMPONENTS INDICATED SEVERAL AREAS OF HOMOGENEITY ACROSS STUDIES, SUGGESTING AN EXISTING DEGREE OF STANDARDISATION. HOWEVER, HETEROGENEITY RELATED TO INTERVENTION CONTENT AND REPORTING IMPEDED DETERMINATION OF INTERVENTION CONTENT AND DELIVERY. STANDARDISATION OF CONTENT, NOMENCLATURE, AND REPORTING DETAILS IS RECOMMENDED TO ENHANCE PROTOCOL TRANSPARENCY, REPLICATION, AND COMPARISON OF INTERVENTION EFFECTIVENESS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
5  777  37 EFFECT OF YOGA AND PHYSIOTHERAPY ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN CHILDREN WITH DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY - A COMPARATIVE STUDY. CONTEXT: ABNORMAL RESPIRATORY FUNCTION IS KNOWN TO BE DETECTABLE ALMOST AS SOON AS IT CAN BE MEASURED RELIABLY. STUDIES HAVE IDENTIFIED THE EFFECT OF RESPIRATORY MUSCLE TRAINING AS WELL AS BREATHING EXERCISES IN IMPROVING PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN CHILDREN WITH DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY (DMD). AIMS: THIS STUDY AIMS TO IDENTIFY THE ADD-ON EFFECT OF YOGA OVER PHYSIOTHERAPY ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN CHILDREN WITH DMD. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY-FOUR PATIENTS WITH DMD WERE RANDOMIZED TO TWO GROUPS. GROUP I RECEIVED HOME-BASED PHYSIOTHERAPY AND GROUP II RECEIVED PHYSIOTHERAPY ALONG WITH YOGA INTERVENTION. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PULMONARY FUNCTION TEST (PFT) WAS ASSESSED BEFORE THE INTERVENTION (BASELINE DATA) AND AT REGULAR INTERVALS OF 3 MONTHS FOR A PERIOD OF 1 YEAR. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: NORMALITY WAS ASSESSED USING SHAPIRO-WILK NORMALITY TEST. THE BASELINE DATA WERE ANALYZED USING MANN-WHITNEY U-TEST TO IDENTIFY THE HOMOGENEITY. REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE WAS USED TO ASSESS SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN STUDY PARAMETERS DURING THE ASSESSMENT OF EVERY 3 MONTHS, BOTH WITHIN AND BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS OF PATIENTS. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 88 PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED ALL THE 5 ASSESSMENTS, WITH A MEAN AGE OF 7.9 +/- 1.5 YEARS. PFT PARAMETERS SUCH AS FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE, MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION (MVV), AND TIDAL VOLUME DURING MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION (MVT) DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN GROUP I. IN GROUP II, FVC AND MVT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED FROM BASELINE UP TO 1 YEAR, WHEREAS MVV IMPROVED FROM BASELINE UP TO 9 MONTHS. TIDAL VOLUME DID NOT SHOW ANY CHANGES IN BOTH THE GROUPS. CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT INTRODUCTION OF YOGA WITH PHYSIOTHERAPY INTERVENTION AT AN EARLY AGE CAN BE CONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE THERAPEUTIC STRATEGIES IN IMPROVING PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH DMD.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
6   95  39 A NATIONAL SURVEY OF YOGA INSTRUCTORS AND THEIR DELIVERY OF YOGA THERAPY. YOGA THERAPY MAY IMPROVE A VARIETY OF SYMPTOMS AND HEALTH CONDITIONS, BUT LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW YOGA THERAPY IS BEING DELIVERED IN THE REAL WORLD. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DESCRIBE THE DELIVERY OF YOGA THERAPY BY YOGA INSTRUCTORS ACROSS THE U.S. IN THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY, CERTIFIED INSTRUCTORS WERE RECRUITED FROM THE IYENGAR YOGA NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, UNITED STATES (IYNAUS) (N = 966) VIA AN EMAIL THAT CONTAINED A LINK TO AN ANONYMOUS ONLINE SURVEY THAT COLLECTED INFORMATION ON DEMOGRAPHICS, THEIR DELIVERY OF YOGA THERAPY, AND THE HEALTH CONDITIONS AND SYMPTOMS SEEN AND RECORDS KEPT BY THE INSTRUCTORS. A TOTAL OF 487 INSTRUCTORS (50.4%) COMPLETED THE SURVE Y. INSTRUCTORS RANGED FROM 28 TO 82 YEARS IN AGE (M = 56.4 +/- 10.1 YEARS) AND HAD BEEN TEACHING FOR 17.0 +/- 10.0 YEARS. THE MAJORITY (N = 384, 81.4%) REPORTED TEACHING SOME FORM OF THERAPEUTIC YOGA EITHER IN GROUPS (N = 261, 55%) AND/OR PRIVATELY (N = 340, 73.4%). ALL INSTRUCTORS (100%) REPORTED MODIFYING POSES IN THEIR REGULAR YOGA CLASSES FOR STUDENTS BECAUSE OF HEALTH CONDITIONS OR SYMPTOMS. OTHER THAN ATTENDANCE, THE MAJORITY (N = 255, 57.3%) REPORTED KEEPING NO RECORDS ON THEIR SESSIONS. STUDENTS CAME TO INSTRUCTORS FOR HELP WITH OVER 54 HEALTH CONDITIONS, MOST COMMONLY MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS AND INJURIES (N = 267, 62.8%), FOLLOWED BY PREGNANCY (N = 56, 13.2%) AND HYPERTENSION (N = 22, 5.2%). NEARLY ALL (N = 373, 85.6%) REPORTED PAIN TO BE THE SYMPTOM THAT BROUGHT STUDENTS TO YOGA THERAPY MOST FREQUENTLY. WHEREAS YOGA IN RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS TYPICALLY IS DELIVERED TO INDIVIDUALS IN LARGE, HOMOGENOUS GROUPS, THE INSTRUCTORS REPORTED THAT MOST YOGA THERAPY IS BEING PROVIDED INDIVIDUALLY OR IN SMALL, GENERAL THERAPEUTIC CLASSES THAT INCLUDE A VARIETY OF HEALTH CONDITIONS. RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA THERAPY UNDER SUCH CONDITIONS. A CLEAR SET OF GUIDELINES FOR ASSESSING AND DOCUMENTING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA THERAPY USING STANDARDIZED, VALID, AND RELIABLE METHODS IS NEEDED, PARTICULARLY FOR PAIN-RELATED CONDITIONS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
7  929  41 EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY: A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL CONTROLLED STUDY. BACKGROUND: CANCER OF BREAST IS MOST COMMON CANCER AMONG WOMEN IN INDIA AND VAST MAJORITY OF COUNTRIES WORLDWIDE. WHILE UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY FOR CARCINOMA MANAGEMENT, WOMEN ENCOUNTER SIDE EFFECTS, WHICH AFFECTS THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY WITH QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH APPROACH AND TIME SERIES DESIGN WAS CONDUCTED, TO STUDY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA ON QOL OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY. METHODOLOGY: ONE HUNDRED BREAST CANCER PATIENTS SCHEDULED FOR 3-WEEKLY, DAY-CARE ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY (CEF REGIMEN) WERE ENROLLED WITH CONSECUTIVE SAMPLING TECHNIQUE, INTO CONTROL (N = 52) AND EXPERIMENT (N = 48) GROUPS, BY CONCEALED RANDOMIZATION FOLLOWING WRITTEN INFORMED CONSENT. BASELINE DATA ON QOL WERE COLLECTED BEFORE FIRST-CYCLE CHEMOTHERAPY USING THE EUROPEAN ORGANIZATION FOR RESEARCH AND TREATMENT OF CANCER QLQ C30. PATIENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WERE TAUGHT DIAPHRAGMATIC BREATHING TECHNIQUES, SYSTEMATIC RELAXATION, AND ALTERNATE NOSTRIL BREATHING, AND JOINTS AND GLANDS NECK AND SHOULDER EXERCISES WERE INSTRUCTED TO PRACTICE TWICE DAILY AT HOME. THEY WERE SUPERVISED IN PRACTICING THESE TECHNIQUES WHILE THEY RECEIVED SECOND, THIRD, FOURTH, FIFTH, AND SIXTH CYCLES OF CHEMOTHERAPY IN THE DAY-CARE FACILITY. PARTICIPANTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED ONLY ROUTINE CARE. ALL PARTICIPANTS RECEIVED STANDARD POST CHEMOTHERAPY PRESCRIPTION. DATA ON QOL WERE COLLECTED FROM ALL PATIENTS DURING THE SECOND, THIRD, FOURTH, FIFTH, AND SIXTH CYCLES OF CHEMOTHERAPY. RESULTS: THE ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT AT THE BASELINE (FIRST CHEMOTHERAPY CYCLE), BREAST CANCER PATIENTS IN CONTROL AND EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS WERE HOMOGENEOUS IN TERMS OF THEIR SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL VARIABLES AND QOL SCORE. YOGA PRACTICES WERE EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING THE QOL OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP IN THE AREAS OF GLOBAL HEALTH STATUS, PHYSICAL FUNCTION, ROLE FUNCTION, AND EMOTIONAL FUNCTION AND DECREASING THE SYMPTOMS OF FATIGUE, INSOMNIA, LOSS OF APPETITE, AND CONSTIPATION, DURING THE PERIOD OF CHEMOTHERAPY. CONCLUSION: YOGA PRACTICES COMPRISING OF RELAXATION TECHNIQUES REDUCE MANY SIDE EFFECTS AND IMPROVE THE QOL OF WOMEN UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY FOR BREAST CANCER.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
8 2543  56 YOGA FOR ASTHMA. BACKGROUND: ASTHMA IS A COMMON CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY DISORDER AFFECTING ABOUT 300 MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE. AS A HOLISTIC THERAPY, YOGA HAS THE POTENTIAL TO RELIEVE BOTH THE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL SUFFERING OF PEOPLE WITH ASTHMA, AND ITS POPULARITY HAS EXPANDED GLOBALLY. A NUMBER OF CLINICAL TRIALS HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA PRACTICE, WITH INCONSISTENT RESULTS. OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN PEOPLE WITH ASTHMA. SEARCH METHODS: WE SYSTEMATICALLY SEARCHED THE COCHRANE AIRWAYS GROUP REGISTER OF TRIALS, WHICH IS DERIVED FROM SYSTEMATIC SEARCHES OF BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATABASES INCLUDING THE COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED, AND PSYCINFO, AND HANDSEARCHING OF RESPIRATORY JOURNALS AND MEETING ABSTRACTS. WE ALSO SEARCHED PEDRO. WE SEARCHED CLINICALTRIALS.GOV AND THE WHO ICTRP SEARCH PORTAL. WE SEARCHED ALL DATABASES FROM THEIR INCEPTION TO 22 JULY 2015, AND USED NO RESTRICTION ON LANGUAGE OF PUBLICATION. WE CHECKED THE REFERENCE LISTS OF ELIGIBLE STUDIES AND RELEVANT REVIEW ARTICLES FOR ADDITIONAL STUDIES. WE ATTEMPTED TO CONTACT INVESTIGATORS OF ELIGIBLE STUDIES AND EXPERTS IN THE FIELD TO LEARN OF OTHER PUBLISHED AND UNPUBLISHED STUDIES. SELECTION CRITERIA: WE INCLUDED RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) THAT COMPARED YOGA WITH USUAL CARE (OR NO INTERVENTION) OR SHAM INTERVENTION IN PEOPLE WITH ASTHMA AND REPORTED AT LEAST ONE OF THE FOLLOWING OUTCOMES: QUALITY OF LIFE, ASTHMA SYMPTOM SCORE, ASTHMA CONTROL, LUNG FUNCTION MEASURES, ASTHMA MEDICATION USAGE, AND ADVERSE EVENTS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: WE EXTRACTED BIBLIOGRAPHIC INFORMATION, CHARACTERISTICS OF PARTICIPANTS, CHARACTERISTICS OF INTERVENTIONS AND CONTROLS, CHARACTERISTICS OF METHODOLOGY, AND RESULTS FOR THE OUTCOMES OF OUR INTEREST FROM ELIGIBLE STUDIES. FOR CONTINUOUS OUTCOMES, WE USED MEAN DIFFERENCE (MD) WITH 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) TO DENOTE THE TREATMENT EFFECTS, IF THE OUTCOMES WERE MEASURED BY THE SAME SCALE ACROSS STUDIES. ALTERNATIVELY, IF THE OUTCOMES WERE MEASURED BY DIFFERENT SCALES ACROSS STUDIES, WE USED STANDARDISED MEAN DIFFERENCE (SMD) WITH 95% CI. FOR DICHOTOMOUS OUTCOMES, WE USED RISK RATIO (RR) WITH 95% CI TO MEASURE THE TREATMENT EFFECTS. WE PERFORMED META-ANALYSIS WITH REVIEW MANAGER 5.3. WE USED THE FIXED-EFFECT MODEL TO POOL THE DATA, UNLESS THERE WAS SUBSTANTIAL HETEROGENEITY AMONG STUDIES, IN WHICH CASE WE USED THE RANDOM-EFFECTS MODEL INSTEAD. FOR OUTCOMES INAPPROPRIATE OR IMPOSSIBLE TO POOL QUANTITATIVELY, WE CONDUCTED A DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS AND SUMMARISED THE FINDINGS NARRATIVELY. MAIN RESULTS: WE INCLUDED 15 RCTS WITH A TOTAL OF 1048 PARTICIPANTS. MOST OF THE TRIALS WERE CONDUCTED IN INDIA, FOLLOWED BY EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES. THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS WERE ADULTS OF BOTH SEXES WITH MILD TO MODERATE ASTHMA FOR SIX MONTHS TO MORE THAN 23 YEARS. FIVE STUDIES INCLUDED YOGA BREATHING ALONE, WHILE THE OTHER STUDIES ASSESSED YOGA INTERVENTIONS THAT INCLUDED BREATHING, POSTURE, AND MEDITATION. INTERVENTIONS LASTED FROM TWO WEEKS TO 54 MONTHS, FOR NO MORE THAN SIX MONTHS IN THE MAJORITY OF STUDIES. THE RISK OF BIAS WAS LOW ACROSS ALL DOMAINS IN ONE STUDY AND UNCLEAR OR HIGH IN AT LEAST ONE DOMAIN FOR THE REMAINDER.THERE WAS SOME EVIDENCE THAT YOGA MAY IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE (MD IN ASTHMA QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE (AQLQ) SCORE PER ITEM 0.57 UNITS ON A 7-POINT SCALE, 95% CI 0.37 TO 0.77; 5 STUDIES; 375 PARTICIPANTS), IMPROVE SYMPTOMS (SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.09 TO 0.65; 3 STUDIES; 243 PARTICIPANTS), AND REDUCE MEDICATION USAGE (RR 5.35, 95% CI 1.29 TO 22.11; 2 STUDIES) IN PEOPLE WITH ASTHMA. THE MD FOR AQLQ SCORE EXCEEDED THE MINIMAL CLINICALLY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE (MCID) OF 0.5, BUT WHETHER THE MEAN CHANGES EXCEEDED THE MCID FOR ASTHMA SYMPTOMS IS UNCERTAIN DUE TO THE LACK OF AN ESTABLISHED MCID IN THE SEVERITY SCORES USED IN THE INCLUDED STUDIES. THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON CHANGE FROM BASELINE FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN ONE SECOND (MD 0.04 LITRES, 95% CI -0.10 TO 0.19; 7 STUDIES; 340 PARTICIPANTS; I(2) = 68%) WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. TWO STUDIES INDICATED IMPROVED ASTHMA CONTROL, BUT DUE TO VERY SIGNIFICANT HETEROGENEITY (I(2) = 98%) WE DID NOT POOL DATA. NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA WERE REPORTED, BUT THE DATA ON THIS OUTCOME WAS LIMITED. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: WE FOUND MODERATE-QUALITY EVIDENCE THAT YOGA PROBABLY LEADS TO SMALL IMPROVEMENTS IN QUALITY OF LIFE AND SYMPTOMS IN PEOPLE WITH ASTHMA. THERE IS MORE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND ITS IMPACT ON LUNG FUNCTION AND MEDICATION USAGE. RCTS WITH A LARGE SAMPLE SIZE AND HIGH METHODOLOGICAL AND REPORTING QUALITY ARE NEEDED TO CONFIRM THE EFFECTS OF YOGA FOR ASTHMA.	2016	

9 1861  28 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF BIKRAM YOGA AND AEROBIC EXERCISE FOR DEPRESSION IN WOMEN: EFFICACY AND STRESS-BASED MECHANISMS. BACKGROUND: THE CURRENT STUDY PRESENTS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED 8-WEEK TRIAL OF BIKRAM YOGA, AEROBIC EXERCISE, AND WAITLIST FOR DEPRESSION. BIKRAM YOGA WAS CHOSEN SPECIFICALLY FOR ITS STANDARDIZED NATURE. FURTHER, WE EXAMINED CHANGES IN THREE STRESS-RELATED CONSTRUCTS-PERCEIVED STRESS, RUMINATION, AND MINDFULNESS-AS MEDIATORS OF ANTIDEPRESSANT EFFECTS. METHOD: FIFTY-THREE WOMEN (AGE 18-65; 74% WHITE) WITH A UNIPOLAR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO ONE OF THE THREE CONDITIONS. RESPONSE WAS DEFINED AS >50% REDUCTION ON THE HAMILTON RATING SCALE FOR DEPRESSION (HAM-D). REMISSION WAS DEFINED AS NO LONGER MEETING CRITERIA FOR DEPRESSION AND A HAM-D </= 7. SELF-REPORTED PERCEIVED STRESS, RUMINATION, AND MINDFULNESS WERE ASSESSED WEEKLY. RESULTS: IN THE INTENTION-TO-TREAT SAMPLE (N = 53), RESPONSE RATES WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN THE BIKRAM YOGA (61.1%; CHI(2) = 10.48, P = .001) AND AEROBIC EXERCISE (60.0%; CHI(2) = 10.44, P = .001) CONDITIONS RELATIVE TO WAITLIST (6.7%). IN THE COMPLETER SAMPLE (N = 42), 73.3% (CHI(2) = 11.41, P = .001) OF WOMEN IN YOGA AND 80.0% (CHI(2) = 13.72, P < .001) IN EXERCISE ACHIEVED RESPONSE COMPARED TO 8.3% IN WAITLIST. REDUCTIONS IN RUMINATION SIGNIFICANTLY MEDIATED HAM-D CHANGE FOR BOTH ACTIVE TREATMENTS, AND MINDFUL ACCEPTANCE WAS A PARTIAL MEDIATOR IN THE EXERCISE CONDITION. LIMITATIONS: THE SAMPLE WAS SMALL IN SIZE, CONSISTED OF WOMEN ONLY, AND WAS ETHNICALLY HOMOGENOUS. INTER-RATER RELIABILITY WAS NOT ASSESSED, AEROBIC EXERCISE WAS NOT STANDARDIZED, AND MEDIATORS WERE ASSESSED BY SELF-REPORT. CONCLUSIONS: BIKRAM YOGA SHOWED DESCRIPTIVELY SIMILAR EFFICACY TO AEROBIC EXERCISE AND BOTH MAY WORK, IN PART, BY HELPING INDIVIDUALS INTERRUPT NEGATIVE THINKING.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
10 1907  39 REVIEW OF YOGA THERAPY DURING CANCER TREATMENT. PURPOSE: REVIEWS OF YOGA RESEARCH THAT DISTINGUISH RESULTS OF TRIALS CONDUCTED DURING (VERSUS AFTER) CANCER TREATMENT ARE NEEDED TO GUIDE FUTURE RESEARCH AND CLINICAL PRACTICE. WE THEREFORE CONDUCTED A REVIEW OF NON-RANDOMIZED STUDIES AND RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS UNDERGOING TREATMENT FOR ANY CANCER TYPE. METHODS: STUDIES WERE IDENTIFIED VIA RESEARCH DATABASES AND REFERENCE LISTS. INCLUSION CRITERIA WERE THE FOLLOWING: (1) CHILDREN OR ADULTS UNDERGOING CANCER TREATMENT, (2) INTERVENTION STATED AS YOGA OR COMPONENT OF YOGA, AND (3) PUBLICATION IN ENGLISH IN PEER-REVIEWED JOURNALS THROUGH OCTOBER 2015. EXCLUSION CRITERIA WERE THE FOLLOWING: (1) SAMPLES RECEIVING HORMONE THERAPY ONLY, (2) INTERVENTIONS INVOLVING MEDITATION ONLY, AND (3) YOGA DELIVERED WITHIN BROADER CANCER RECOVERY OR MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION PROGRAMS. RESULTS: RESULTS OF NON-RANDOMIZED (ADULT N = 8, PEDIATRIC N = 4) AND RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (ADULT N = 13, PEDIATRIC N = 0) CONDUCTED DURING CANCER TREATMENT ARE SUMMARIZED SEPARATELY BY AGE GROUP. FINDINGS MOST CONSISTENTLY SUPPORT IMPROVEMENT IN PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES (E.G., DEPRESSION, DISTRESS, ANXIETY). SEVERAL STUDIES ALSO FOUND THAT YOGA ENHANCED QUALITY OF LIFE, THOUGH FURTHER INVESTIGATION IS NEEDED TO CLARIFY DOMAIN-SPECIFIC EFFICACY (E.G., PHYSICAL, SOCIAL, CANCER-SPECIFIC). REGARDING PHYSICAL AND BIOMEDICAL OUTCOMES, EVIDENCE INCREASINGLY SUGGESTS THAT YOGA AMELIORATES SLEEP AND FATIGUE; ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO ADVANCE PRELIMINARY FINDINGS FOR OTHER TREATMENT SEQUELAE AND STRESS/IMMUNITY BIOMARKERS. CONCLUSIONS: AMONG ADULTS UNDERGOING CANCER TREATMENT, EVIDENCE SUPPORTS RECOMMENDING YOGA FOR IMPROVING PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES, WITH POTENTIAL FOR ALSO IMPROVING PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS. EVIDENCE IS INSUFFICIENT TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN PEDIATRIC ONCOLOGY. WE DESCRIBE SUGGESTIONS FOR STRENGTHENING YOGA RESEARCH METHODOLOGY TO INFORM CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
11 1159  59 ESTABLISHING KEY COMPONENTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR REDUCING DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, AND IMPROVING WELL-BEING: A DELPHI METHOD STUDY. BACKGROUND: PREVIOUS RESEARCH SUGGESTS BENEFITS OF YOGA IN REDUCING DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY. HOWEVER, COMMON CONCERNS IN REVIEWS OF THE RESEARCH INCLUDE LACK OF DETAIL, RATIONALE AND CONSISTENCY OF APPROACH OF INTERVENTIONS USED. ISSUES RELATED TO HETEROGENEITY INCLUDE AMOUNT, TYPES AND DELIVERY OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS. THIS STUDY AIMS TO DOCUMENT CONSENSUS-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS FOR CONSISTENCY OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR REDUCING DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY. METHODS: THE DELPHI METHOD WAS USED TO ESTABLISH CONSENSUS FROM EXPERIENCED YOGA TEACHERS. THIRTY-THREE ELIGIBLE TEACHERS WERE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE, FROM FOUR DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. TWO ROUNDS OF AN ONLINE SURVEY WERE SENT TO PARTICIPANTS. THE FIRST ROUND SOUGHT INITIAL VIEWS. THE SECOND ROUND SOUGHT CONSENSUS ON A SUMMARY OF THOSE VIEWS. SURVEY QUESTIONS RELATED TO FREQUENCY AND DURATION (DOSAGE) OF THE YOGA, APPROACHES AND TECHNIQUES TO BE INCLUDED OR AVOIDED, AND TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE FOR YOGA TEACHERS. RESULTS: TWENTY-FOUR TEACHERS AGREED TO PARTICIPATE. EIGHTEEN COMPLETED THE SECOND ROUND (N = 18). GENERAL CONSENSUS (>75% OF PARTICIPANTS IN AGREEMENT) WAS ACHIEVED ON PARAMETERS OF PRACTICE (DOSAGE): AN AVERAGE OF 30 TO 40 MINUTES, TO BE DONE 5 TIMES PER WEEK, OVER A PERIOD OF 6 WEEKS. NUMEROUS RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOGA TECHNIQUES TO INCLUDE OR AVOID WERE COLLECTED IN THE FIRST ROUND. THE SECOND ROUND PRODUCED A CONSENSUS STATEMENT ON THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS. BREATH REGULATION AND POSTURES WERE CONSIDERED VERY IMPORTANT OR ESSENTIAL FOR PEOPLE WITH DEPRESSION; AND RELAXATION, BREATH REGULATION AND MEDITATION BEING VERY IMPORTANT OR ESSENTIAL FOR PEOPLE WITH ANXIETY. OTHER RECOMMENDED COMPONENTS ALSO ACHIEVED CONSENSUS. THERE WAS ALSO GENERAL CONSENSUS THAT IT IS VERY IMPORTANT OR ESSENTIAL FOR TEACHERS TO HAVE A MINIMUM OF 500 TRAINING HOURS OVER 2 YEARS, AT LEAST 2 YEARS TEACHING EXPERIENCE, TRAINING IN DEVELOPING PERSONALISED YOGA PRACTICES, TRAINING IN YOGA FOR MENTAL HEALTH, AND PROFESSIONAL SUPERVISION OR MENTORING. CONCLUSIONS: THE DELPHI PROCESS HAS ACHIEVED A CONSENSUS STATEMENT ON THE APPLICATION OF YOGA FOR REDUCING ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. THIS CONSENSUS PROVIDES A CHECKLIST FOR IDENTIFICATION OF COMMONALITIES AND EVALUATION OF PAST RESEARCH. FUTURE RESEARCH CAN PROCEED TO DEVELOP AND EVALUATE CONSENSUS-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION PROTOCOLS FOR THE REDUCTION OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, AND IMPROVEMENTS IN WELL-BEING.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
12 1748  40 PILOT RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL OF A DYADIC YOGA PROGRAM FOR GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS. BACKGROUND: WHILE THE USE OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE IN MANAGING GLIOMA PATIENTS' SYMPTOMS IS NOT WELL STUDIED, THE HIGH SYMPTOM BURDEN IN PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS IS WELL ESTABLISHED. WE CONDUCTED A PILOT RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND PRELIMINARY EFFICACY OF A DYADIC YOGA (DY) INTERVENTION AS A SUPPORTIVE CARE STRATEGY. METHODS: GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS WERE RANDOMIZED TO A 12-SESSION DY OR WAITLIST CONTROL (WLC) GROUP. PRIOR TO RADIOTHERAPY AND RANDOMIZATION, BOTH GROUPS COMPLETED MEASURES OF CANCER-RELATED SYMPTOMS (MD ANDERSON SYMPTOM INVENTORY-BRAIN TUMOR MODULE), DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (CENTER FOR EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES-DEPRESSION MEASURE), FATIGUE (BRIEF FATIGUE INVENTORY), AND OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL; MEDICAL OUTCOMES STUDY 36-ITEM SHORT-FORM SURVEY). DYADS WERE REASSESSED AT THE LAST DAY OF RADIOTHERAPY. RESULTS: TWENTY PATIENTS (MEAN AGE: 46 YEARS, 50% FEMALE, 80% WHO GRADE IV AND CAREGIVERS (MEAN AGE: 50 YEARS, 70% FEMALE, 50% SPOUSES) PARTICIPATED IN THE TRIAL. A PRIORI FEASIBILITY CRITERIA WERE MET REGARDING CONSENT (70%), ADHERENCE (88%), AND RETENTION (95%) RATES. CONTROLLING FOR RELEVANT COVARIATES, CHANGE SCORE ANALYSES REVEALED CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS FOR PATIENTS IN THE DY COMPARED WITH THE WLC GROUP FOR OVERALL CANCER SYMPTOM SEVERITY (D = 0.96) AND SYMPTOM INTERFERENCE (D = 0.74), DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (D = 0.71), AND MENTAL QOL (D = 0.69). CAREGIVERS IN THE DY GROUP REPORTED CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS (D = 1.12), FATIGUE (D = 0.89), AND MENTAL QOL (D = 0.49) RELATIVE TO THOSE IN THE WLC GROUP. CONCLUSION: A DY INTERVENTION APPEARS TO BE A FEASIBLE AND BENEFICIAL SYMPTOM AND QOL MANAGEMENT STRATEGY FOR GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR CAREGIVERS. AN EFFICACY TRIAL WITH A MORE STRINGENT CONTROL GROUP IS WARRANTED.

13 1495  39 INTERVENTION PROTOCOL FOR INVESTIGATING YOGA IMPLEMENTED DURING CHEMOTHERAPY. OBJECTIVE: FATIGUE AND OTHER TREATMENT-RELATED SYMPTOMS ARE CRITICAL THERAPEUTIC TARGETS FOR IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH COLORECTAL CANCER DURING CHEMOTHERAPY. YOGA IS A PROMISING INTERVENTION FOR IMPROVING THESE THERAPEUTIC TARGETS AND HAS BEEN PRIMARILY INVESTIGATED IN THE GROUP-CLASS FORMAT, WHICH IS LESS FEASIBLE FOR CANCER PATIENTS WITH HIGH SYMPTOM BURDEN TO ATTEND. THUS, WE DEVELOPED A PROTOCOL FOR IMPLEMENTING YOGA INDIVIDUALLY IN THE CLINIC AMONG PATIENTS RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY. METHODS: WE FOLLOWED RECOMMENDED DOMAINS FOR DEVELOPING A YOGA PROTOCOL TO BE USED IN AN EFFICACY TRIAL. THESE RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDE CONSIDERATION TO THE STYLE, DELIVERY, COMPONENTS OF THE INTERVENTION, DOSE, SPECIFIC CLASS SEQUENCES, FACILITATION OF HOME PRACTICE, MEASUREMENT OF INTERVENTION FIDELITY, SELECTION OF INSTRUCTORS, AND DEALING WITH MODIFICATIONS. THE INTERVENTION PROTOCOL WAS DEVELOPED BY AN INTERDISCIPLINARY TEAM. PROTOCOL: YOGA SKILLS TRAINING (YST) CONSISTS OF FOUR 30-MINUTE IN-PERSON SESSIONS AND WAS IMPLEMENTED WHILE IN THE CHAIR DURING CHEMOTHERAPY INFUSIONS FOR COLORECTAL CANCER WITH RECOMMENDED DAILY HOME PRACTICE FOR EIGHT WEEKS. THERAPEUTIC GOALS OF THE YST ARE TO REDUCE FATIGUE, CIRCADIAN DISRUPTION, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. ELEMENTS OF THE YST ARE AWARENESS MEDITATION, GENTLE SEATED MOVEMENT, BREATHING PRACTICE, AND RELAXATION MEDITATION. ATTENTION, COMFORT, AND EASE ARE ALSO HIGHLIGHTED. CONCLUSION: THIS DESCRIPTION OF A PROTOCOL FOR INTEGRATING YOGA WITH CONVENTIONAL CANCER TREATMENT WILL INFORM FUTURE STUDY DESIGNS AND CLINICAL PRACTICE. THE DESIGN OF THE YST IS NOVEL BECAUSE IT IMPLEMENTS YOGA-MOST COMMONLY STUDIED WHEN TAUGHT TO GROUPS OUTSIDE OF THE CLINICAL SETTING- INDIVIDUALLY DURING CLINICAL CARE.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
14  199  33 A RESEARCH PROTOCOL FOR A PILOT, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL DESIGNED TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF A DYADIC VERSUS INDIVIDUAL YOGA PROGRAM FOR FAMILY CAREGIVERS OF GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY. BACKGROUND: ALTHOUGH THE DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF A PRIMARY BRAIN TUMOR PRESENT UNIQUE CHALLENGES TO PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS, EVIDENCE-BASED SUPPORTIVE CARE INTERVENTIONS ARE GENERALLY LACKING. THE PRIMARY AIM OF THIS RESEARCH PROTOCOL IS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING A DYADIC YOGA (DY) VERSUS A CAREGIVER YOGA (CY) INTERVENTION OR A WAIT-LIST CONTROL (WLC) GROUP USING A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL DESIGN. METHODS: SEVENTY-FIVE GLIOMA PATIENTS UNDERGOING RADIOTHERAPY AND THEIR FAMILY CAREGIVERS ARE RANDOMIZED TO THE DY, CY, OR A WLC GROUP. PATIENT-CAREGIVER DYADS IN THE DY GROUP AND CAREGIVERS IN THE CY GROUP RECEIVE 15 SESSIONS (45 MIN EACH) OVER THE COURSE OF PATIENTS' STANDARD RADIOTHERAPY (6 WEEKS). PATIENTS AND CAREGIVERS IN ALL GROUPS COMPLETE BASELINE ASSESSMENTS OF SYMPTOMS, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), AND HEALTH UTILIZATION OUTCOMES PRIOR TO RANDOMIZATION. FOLLOW-UP ASSESSMENTS ARE PERFORMED 6 WEEKS AND THEN AGAIN 3 MONTHS LATER. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME IS FEASIBILITY (I.E., >/= 50% OF ELIGIBLE DYADS CONSENT, >/= 70% OF ENROLLED DYADS COMPLETE ALL ASSESSMENTS, AND >/= 50% OF ALL PRACTICE SESSIONS ARE ATTENDED). WE WILL ALSO PERFORM PRIMARILY DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSES OF THE SELF-REPORTED OUTCOMES (E.G., FATIGUE, OVERALL QOL) AND EXPLORE POTENTIAL INTERVENTION MODERATORS (E.G., PERFORMANCE STATUS) TO INFORM A LARGER FUTURE TRIAL. CONCLUSION: THIS TRIAL WILL PROVIDE IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING THE FEASIBILITY OF A DYADIC VERSUS A CAREGIVER YOGA INTERVENTION REGARDING SYMPTOM, QOL, AND HEALTH UTILIZATION OUTCOMES IN GLIOMA PATIENTS AND THEIR CAREGIVERS.

15 1574  41 MANAGING LYMPHEDEMA, INCREASING RANGE OF MOTION, AND QUALITY OF LIFE THROUGH YOGA THERAPY AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. LYMPHEDEMA IS A COMMON COMPLICATION OF BREAST CANCER TREATMENT. YOGA IS A NONCONVENTIONAL AND NONINVASIVE INTERVENTION THAT IS REPORTED TO SHOW BENEFICIAL EFFECTS IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER-RELATED LYMPHEDEMA (BCRL). THIS STUDY ATTEMPTED TO SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEW THE EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY ON MANAGING LYMPHEDEMA, INCREASING THE RANGE OF MOTION (ROM), AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) AMONG BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. THE REVIEW SEARCH INCLUDED STUDIES FROM ELECTRONIC BIBLIOGRAPHIC DATABASES, NAMELY MEDLINE (PUBMED), EMBASE, AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR TILL JUNE 2019. STUDIES WHICH ASSESSED THE OUTCOME VARIABLES SUCH AS QOL AND MANAGEMENT OF LYMPHEDEMA OR RELATED PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS AS EFFECT OF YOGA INTERVENTION WERE CONSIDERED FOR REVIEW. TWO AUTHORS INDIVIDUALLY REVIEWED, SELECTED ACCORDING TO COCHRANE GUIDELINES, AND EXTRACTED THE ARTICLES USING COVIDENCE SOFTWARE. SCREENING PROCESS OF THIS REVIEW RESULTED IN A TOTAL OF SEVEN STUDIES. THE DIFFERENT STYLES OF YOGA EMPLOYED IN THE STUDIES WERE IYENGAR YOGA (N = 2), SATYANANDA YOGA (N = 2), HATHA YOGA (N = 2), AND ASHTANGA YOGA (N = 1). THE LENGTH OF INTERVENTION AND POST INTERVENTION ANALYSIS RANGED FROM 8 WEEKS TO 12 MONTHS. FOUR STUDIES INCLUDED HOME PRACTICE SESSIONS. QOL, ROM, AND MUSCULOSKELETAL SYMPTOMS SHOWED IMPROVEMENT IN ALL THE STUDIES. YOGA COULD BE A SAFE AND FEASIBLE EXERCISE INTERVENTION FOR BCRL PATIENTS. EVIDENCE GENERATED FROM THESE STUDIES WAS OF MODERATE STRENGTH. FURTHER LONG-TERM CLINICAL TRIALS WITH LARGE SAMPLE SIZE ARE ESSENTIAL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND STANDARDIZATION OF YOGA INTERVENTION GUIDELINES FOR BCRL PATIENTS.	2021

SELECTION CRITERIA: ALL RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) INCLUDING PEOPLE WITH SCHIZOPHRENIA COMPARING YOGA AS PART OF A PACKAGE OF CARE WITH NON-STANDARD CARE. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: THERE WERE NO DATA TO ANALYSE AS NO STUDIES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. MAIN RESULTS: THE SEARCHES IDENTIFIED 30 STUDIES THAT COULD BE RELEVANT TO THIS REVIEW. AFTER CAREFUL INSPECTION, 29 WERE EXCLUDED AND ONE IS AWAITING CLASSIFICATION. NO DATA WERE AVAILABLE FOR ANALYSES. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: IN VIEW OF THE LACK OF EVIDENCE FROM RCTS, IT IS CURRENTLY NOT POSSIBLE FOR US TO COMMENT ON THE USE OF YOGA AS PART OF A PACKAGE OF CARE VERSUS NON-STANDARD CARE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
17 2389  51 YOGA AND AEROBIC DANCE FOR PAIN MANAGEMENT IN JUVENILE IDIOPATHIC ARTHRITIS: PROTOCOL FOR A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: JUVENILE IDIOPATHIC ARTHRITIS (JIA) IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON TYPES OF ARTHRITIS AMONG CHILDREN. ACCORDING TO JIA GUIDELINES FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY (PA), STRUCTURED PA INTERVENTIONS LED TO IMPROVED HEALTH OUTCOMES. HOWEVER, MANY PA PROGRAMS, SUCH AS YOGA AND AEROBIC DANCE, HAVE NOT BEEN STUDIED IN THIS POPULATION DESPITE BEING POPULAR AMONG YOUTH. WEB-BASED PA PROGRAMS COULD PROVIDE PATIENTS WITH ACCESSIBLE AND AFFORDABLE INTERVENTIONS. OBJECTIVE: THE PRIMARY AIMS OF THE PROPOSED PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) ARE TO EXAMINE (1) THE FEASIBILITY OF CONDUCTING A FULL-SCALE RCT TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TWO POPULAR TYPES OF PA: A YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM AND AN AEROBIC DANCE TRAINING PROGRAM, IN FEMALE ADOLESCENTS (AGED 13-18 YEARS) WITH JIA COMPARED WITH AN ELECTRONIC PAMPHLET CONTROL GROUP; AND (2) THE ACCEPTABILITY OF THESE INTERVENTIONS. METHODS: A THREE-ARM PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED OPEN-LABEL STUDY WITH A PARALLEL GROUP DESIGN WILL BE USED. A TOTAL OF 25 FEMALE ADOLESCENTS WITH JIA WHO HAVE PAIN WILL BE RANDOMIZED IN A RATIO OF 2:2:1 TO ONE OF THE 3 GROUPS: (1) ONLINE YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM (GROUP A: N=10); (2) ONLINE AEROBIC DANCE TRAINING PROGRAM (GROUP B: N=10); AND (3) ELECTRONIC PAMPHLET CONTROL GROUP (GROUP C: N=5). PARTICIPANTS IN GROUPS A AND B WILL COMPLETE 3 INDIVIDUAL 1-HOUR SESSIONS PER WEEK USING ONLINE EXERCISE VIDEOS, AS WELL AS A 1-HOUR VIRTUAL GROUP SESSION PER WEEK USING A VIDEOCONFERENCING PLATFORM FOR 12 WEEKS. PARTICIPANTS FROM ALL GROUPS WILL HAVE ACCESS TO AN ELECTRONIC EDUCATIONAL PAMPHLET ON PA FOR ARTHRITIS DEVELOPED BY THE ARTHRITIS SOCIETY. ALL PARTICIPANTS WILL ALSO TAKE PART IN WEEKLY ONLINE CONSULTATIONS WITH A RESEARCH COORDINATOR AND DISCUSSIONS ON FACEBOOK WITH PARTICIPANTS FROM THEIR OWN GROUP. FEASIBILITY (IE, RECRUITMENT RATE, SELF-REPORTED ADHERENCE TO THE INTERVENTIONS, DROPOUT RATES, AND PERCENTAGE OF MISSING DATA), ACCEPTABILITY, AND USABILITY OF FACEBOOK AND THE VIDEOCONFERENCING PLATFORM WILL BE ASSESSED AT THE END OF THE PROGRAM. PAIN INTENSITY, PARTICIPATION IN GENERAL PA, MORNING STIFFNESS, FUNCTIONAL STATUS, FATIGUE, SELF-EFFICACY, PATIENT GLOBAL ASSESSMENT, DISEASE ACTIVITY, AND ADVERSE EVENTS WILL BE ASSESSED USING SELF-ADMINISTERED ELECTRONIC SURVEYS AT BASELINE AND THEN WEEKLY UNTIL THE END OF THE 12-WEEK PROGRAM. RESULTS: THIS PILOT RCT HAS BEEN FUNDED BY THE ARTHRITIS HEALTH PROFESSIONS ASSOCIATION. THIS PROTOCOL WAS APPROVED BY THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF EASTERN ONTARIO RESEARCH ETHICS BOARD (#17/08X). AS OF MAY 11, 2020, RECRUITMENT AND DATA COLLECTION HAVE NOT STARTED. CONCLUSIONS: TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AND AEROBIC DANCE AS PAIN MANAGEMENT INTERVENTIONS FOR FEMALE ADOLESCENTS WITH JIA. THE USE OF ONLINE PROGRAMS TO DISSEMINATE THESE 2 PA INTERVENTIONS MAY FACILITATE ACCESS TO ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF PAIN MANAGEMENT. THIS STUDY CAN LEAD TO A FULL-SCALE RCT.

18   41  39 A BRIEF YOGA INTERVENTION IMPLEMENTED DURING CHEMOTHERAPY: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVES: FATIGUE AND OTHER TREATMENT-RELATED SYMPTOMS (E.G., SLEEP DISTURBANCE) ARE CRITICAL TARGETS FOR IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY. YOGA MAY REDUCE THE BURDEN OF SUCH SYMPTOMS. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE FEASIBILITY OF CONDUCTING A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY OF A BRIEF YOGA INTERVENTION DURING CHEMOTHERAPY FOR COLORECTAL CANCER. DESIGN: WE RANDOMIZED ADULTS WITH COLORECTAL CANCER TO A BRIEF YOGA SKILLS TRAINING (YST) OR AN ATTENTION CONTROL (AC; EMPATHIC ATTENTION AND RECORDED EDUCATION). SETTING: THE INTERVENTIONS AND ASSESSMENTS WERE IMPLEMENTED INDIVIDUALLY IN THE CLINIC WHILE PATIENTS WERE IN THE CHAIR RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY. INTERVENTIONS: BOTH INTERVENTIONS CONSISTED OF THREE SESSIONS AND RECOMMENDED HOME PRACTICE. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS FEASIBILITY (ACCRUAL, RETENTION, ADHERENCE, DATA COLLECTION). SELF-REPORTED OUTCOMES (I.E., FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, QUALITY OF LIFE) AND INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS WERE ALSO DESCRIBED TO INFORM FUTURE STUDIES. RESULTS: OF 52 PATIENTS INITIALLY IDENTIFIED, 28 WERE APPROACHED, AND 15 ENROLLED (AGE MEAN = 57.5 YEARS; 80% WHITE; 60% MALE). REASONS FOR DECLINING PARTICIPATION WERE: NOT INTERESTED (N = 6), DID NOT PERCEIVE A NEED (N = 2), AND OTHER (N = 5). TWO PARTICIPANTS WERE LOST TO FOLLOW-UP IN EACH GROUP DUE TO TREATMENT CHANGES. THUS, 75% OF PARTICIPANTS WERE RETAINED IN THE YST AND 71% IN THE AC ARM. PARTICIPANTS RETAINED IN THE STUDY ADHERED TO 97% OF THE IN-PERSON INTERVENTION SESSIONS AND COMPLETED ALL QUESTIONNAIRES. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATED THE FEASIBILITY OF CONDUCTING A LARGER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL TO ASSESS YST AMONG PATIENTS RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY FOR COLORECTAL CANCER.

19  234  35 A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS AS INTEGRATIVE TREATMENT IN BREAST CANCER. PURPOSE: BREAST CANCER IS A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM ALL OVER THE WORLD. THE TREATMENT OF BREAST CANCER HAS MANY SIDE EFFECTS. YOGA HAS BEEN SUGGESTED AS AN INTEGRATIVE FORM OF THERAPY FOR BREAST CANCER. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEW YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR BREAST CANCER AND DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF THESE INTERVENTIONS AS INTEGRATIVE MODALITIES OF TREATMENT IN ALTERING VARIOUS OUTCOMES RELATED TO BREAST CANCER. METHODS: STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IF (1) EXCLUSIVELY TARGETED BREAST CANCER PATIENTS; (2) PUBLISHED BETWEEN 2013 AND MAY 2016; (3) WRITTEN IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE; (4) PUBLISHED IN A PEER-REVIEWED JOURNALS INDEXED IN MEDLINE (PUBMED), CINAHL, ERIC AND ALT HEALTH WATCH; (5) THEY USED ANY TYPE OF YOGA AS A PART OF OR THE WHOLE INTERVENTION; AND (6) UTILIZED A QUANTITATIVE DESIGN FOR EVALUATION. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 23 INTERVENTIONS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. MAJORITY OF THE STUDIES HAD BEEN DONE IN USA (N = 9), FOLLOWED BY GERMANY (N = 3), INDIA (N = 3) AND TURKEY (N = 2). ONE STUDY EACH WAS FROM AUSTRALIA, CANADA, IRAN, TAIWAN, POLAND, AND UK. TWENTY-TWO OF THE 23 INTERVENTIONS HAD STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN STUDIED OUTCOME MEASURES. CONCLUSIONS: DESPITE THE LIMITATIONS OF WIDE VARIABILITIES IN SAMPLE SIZE, LACK OF STANDARDIZED APPROACH IN CONDUCTING YOGA, MULTIPLICITY OF OUTCOME MEASURES, VARYING DURATIONS OF INTERVENTIONS AND LACK OF USING BEHAVIORAL THEORIES, YOGA AS AN INTEGRATIVE FORM OF THERAPY FOR BREAST CANCER IS A PROMISING APPROACH. MORE INTERVENTIONS UTILIZING YOGA NEED TO BE TESTED.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
20 1240  35 FEASIBILITY OF A MINDFUL YOGA PROGRAM FOR WOMEN WITH METASTATIC BREAST CANCER: RESULTS OF A RANDOMIZED PILOT STUDY. PURPOSE: PATIENTS WITH METASTATIC BREAST CANCER (MBC) EXPERIENCE HIGH LEVELS OF SYMPTOMS. YOGA INTERVENTIONS HAVE SHOWN PROMISE FOR IMPROVING CANCER SYMPTOMS BUT HAVE RARELY BEEN TESTED IN PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED DISEASE. THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE ACCEPTABILITY OF A COMPREHENSIVE YOGA PROGRAM FOR MBC AND THE FEASIBILITY OF CONDUCTING A RANDOMIZED TRIAL TESTING THE INTERVENTION. METHODS: SIXTY-THREE WOMEN WITH MBC WERE RANDOMIZED WITH A 2:1 ALLOCATION TO YOGA OR A SUPPORT GROUP COMPARISON CONDITION. BOTH INTERVENTIONS INVOLVED EIGHT WEEKLY GROUP SESSIONS. FEASIBILITY WAS QUANTIFIED USING RATES OF ACCRUAL, ATTRITION, AND SESSION ATTENDANCE. ACCEPTABILITY WAS ASSESSED WITH A STANDARDIZED SELF-REPORT MEASURE. PAIN, FATIGUE, SLEEP QUALITY, PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS, MINDFULNESS, AND FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE, POST-INTERVENTION, AND 3 AND 6 MONTHS POST-INTERVENTION. RESULTS: WE MET GOALS FOR ACCRUAL AND RETENTION, WITH 50% OF ELIGIBLE PATIENTS ENROLLED AND 87% OF RANDOMIZED PARTICIPANTS COMPLETING POST-INTERVENTION SURVEYS. SIXTY-FIVE PERCENT OF WOMEN IN THE YOGA CONDITION AND 90% IN THE SUPPORT GROUP ATTENDED >/= 4 SESSIONS. EIGHTY PERCENT OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA CONDITION AND 65% IN THE SUPPORT GROUP INDICATED THAT THEY WERE HIGHLY SATISFIED WITH THE INTERVENTION. FOLLOWING TREATMENT, WOMEN IN THE YOGA INTERVENTION HAD MODEST IMPROVEMENTS IN SOME OUTCOMES; HOWEVER, OVERALL SYMPTOM LEVELS WERE LOW FOR WOMEN IN BOTH CONDITIONS. CONCLUSIONS: FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE YOGA INTERVENTION CONTENT WAS HIGHLY ACCEPTABLE TO PATIENTS WITH MBC, BUT THAT THERE ARE CHALLENGES TO IMPLEMENTING AN INTERVENTION INVOLVING EIGHT GROUP-BASED IN-PERSON SESSIONS. ALTERNATIVE MODES OF DELIVERY MAY BE NECESSARY TO REACH PATIENTS MOST IN NEED OF INTERVENTION.	2019

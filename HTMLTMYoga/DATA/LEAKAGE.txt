1 2339 131 URINARY INCONTINENCE AMONG GROUP FITNESS INSTRUCTORS INCLUDING YOGA AND PILATES TEACHERS. AIMS: CONTROVERSIES EXIST ON THE ROLE OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ON URINARY INCONTINENCE (UI), AND SEARCH ON PUBMED REVEALED NO STUDIES ON UI IN FITNESS INSTRUCTORS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE PREVALENCE OF UI AMONG FEMALE GROUP FITNESS INSTRUCTORS, INCLUDING PILATES AND YOGA TEACHERS. METHODS: THIS WAS A CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY OF 1,473 INSTRUCTORS REPRESENTING THREE OF THE LARGEST FITNESS COMPANIES RECRUITED FROM 59 FITNESS CENTERS IN NORWAY. THEY FILLED IN AN ONLINE SURVEY (QUESTBACK) ABOUT GENERAL HEALTH, EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND, AND NUMBER OF HOURS TEACHING PER WEEK. PREVALENCE OF UI WAS EVALUATED BY THE INTERNATIONAL CONSENSUS ON INCONTINENCE QUESTIONNAIRE, SHORT FORM (ICIQ-UI SF). RESULTS: THREE OUT OF 152 MEN (2%) REPORTED UI. SIX HUNDRED EIGHTY-FIVE WOMEN, MEAN AGE 32.7 YEARS (RANGE 18-68) ANSWERED THE QUESTIONNAIRE. 26.3% OF ALL THE FEMALE INSTRUCTORS REPORTED TO HAVE UI, WITH 21.4% REPORTING LEAKAGE >/= ONCE A WEEK, 3.2% 2-3 TIMES/WEEK AND 1.7% >/= ONCE PER DAY. 24.4% REPORTED THE LEAKAGE TO BE SMALL TO MODERATE AND THE BOTHER SCORE WAS 4.6 (SD 2.4) OUT OF 21. 15.3% REPORTED LEAKAGE DURING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND 10.9% WHEN COUGHING/SNEEZING. 25.9% OF YOGA AND PILATES INSTRUCTORS REPORTED UI. CONCLUSIONS: THIS IS THE FIRST REPORT ON UI AMONG FITNESS INSTRUCTORS AND THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT UI IS PREVALENT AMONG FEMALE FITNESS INSTRUCTORS, INCLUDING YOGA AND PILATES TEACHERS. MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS TOPIC SEEMS TO BE IMPORTANT IN THE BASIC EDUCATION OF FITNESS INSTRUCTORS.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
2 2671  25 YOGA IN PREGNANCY: AN EXAMINATION OF MATERNAL AND FETAL RESPONSES TO 26 YOGA POSTURES. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE ACUTE MATERNAL AND FETAL EFFECTS OF YOGA POSTURES AND SUSPECTED CONTRAINDICATED POSTURES IN A PROSPECTIVE COHORT OF HEALTHY PREGNANT WOMEN IN THE THIRD TRIMESTER. METHODS: THIS WAS A PROSPECTIVE STUDY THAT EVALUATED PREGNANT WOMEN BETWEEN 35 0/7 AND 37 6/7 WEEKS OF GESTATION IN A ONE-ON-ONE YOGA SESSION. A BASELINE NONSTRESS TEST, VITAL SIGNS, AND PULSE OXIMETRY WERE PERFORMED. PARTICIPANTS THEN ASSUMED 26 YOGA POSTURES. VITAL SIGNS, PULSE OXIMETRY, TOCOMETRY, AND CONTINUOUS FETAL HEART RATE MONITORING WERE OBTAINED IN EACH POSTURE. POSTSESSION NONSTRESS TEST, VITAL SIGNS, AND PULSE OXIMETRY WERE OBTAINED. PARTICIPANTS WERE CONTACTED 24 HOURS POSTSESSION. RESULTS: TWENTY-FIVE HEALTHY PREGNANT WOMEN WERE EVALUATED. TEN REPORTED REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE, EIGHT WERE FAMILIAR WITH YOGA, AND SEVEN HAD NO YOGA EXPERIENCE. YOGA GROUPS WERE SIMILAR IN AGE, RACE, BODY MASS INDEX, GESTATIONAL AGE, AND PARITY. PRESESSION AND POSTSESSION NONSTRESS TESTS WERE REACTIVE. PRESESSION AND POSTSESSION DATA SHOWED NO CHANGE IN MATERNAL HEART RATE, TEMPERATURE, PULSE OXIMETRY, OR FETAL HEART RATE. DURING THE 26 YOGA POSTURES, VITAL SIGNS, PULSE OXIMETRY, AND UTERINE TOCOMETRY REMAINED NORMAL IN ALL WOMEN AND IN ALL POSTURES. THE FETAL HEART RATE ACROSS ALL 26 POSTURES WAS NORMAL. THERE WERE NO FALLS OR INJURIES DURING THE TOTAL CUMULATIVE 650 POSES. NO PARTICIPANTS REPORTED DECREASED FETAL MOVEMENT, CONTRACTIONS, LEAKAGE OF FLUID, OR VAGINAL BLEEDING IN THE 24-HOUR FOLLOW-UP. CONCLUSION: ALL 26 YOGA POSTURES WERE WELL-TOLERATED WITH NO ACUTE ADVERSE MATERNAL PHYSIOLOGIC OR FETAL HEART RATE CHANGES.

THE PATIENT PRESENTED ABNORMAL PATTERN OF GAIT WITH NO SWELLING OVER THE GROIN, THIGH, OR BUTTOCK. MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING DEMONSTRATED A TEAR OF THE QUADRATUS FEMORIS MUSCLE WITH AN ASSOCIATED EXTENSIVE HEMATOMA FORMATION. PATIENT WAS TREATED WITH A REHABILITATION PROGRAM CONSISTING OF NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS AND PHYSIOTHERAPY. AT THE FOLLOW-UP CONTROL, THE PATIENT HAD IMPROVED HER PAIN AND FLEXIBILITY OF THE HIP, AND GRADUALLY SHE RETURNED TO DAILY ACTIVITIES AND YOGA EXERCISES. SUCH AN ENTITY IS A RARE CAUSE OF HIP PAIN AFTER EXERCISE AND SHOULD BE KEPT IN MIND BY THE ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON, IN CASES OF GLUTEAL PAIN AFTER INTENSE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. MOREOVER, SUCH A CONDITION SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE DIAGNOSTIC ALGORITHM OF UNKNOWN ORIGIN HIP PAIN.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
7  363  25 ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN YOGA/MEDITATION USE, BODY SATISFACTION, AND WEIGHT MANAGEMENT METHODS: RESULTS OF A NATIONAL CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY OF 8009 AUSTRALIAN WOMEN. OBJECTIVES: TO ANALYZE WHETHER YOGA OR MEDITATION USE IS ASSOCIATED WITH BODY (DIS)SATISFACTION AND WEIGHT CONTROL METHODS IN AUSTRALIAN WOMEN. METHODS: WOMEN AGES 34 TO 39 Y FROM THE AUSTRALIAN LONGITUDINAL STUDY ON WOMEN'S HEALTH WERE SURVEYED REGARDING BODY SATISFACTION, WEIGHT CONTROL BEHAVIORS, AND YOGA AND MEDITATION PRACTICE. ASSOCIATIONS OF BODY SATISFACTION AND WEIGHT CONTROL METHODS WITH YOGA/MEDITATION PRACTICE WERE ANALYZED USING CHI-SQUARED TESTS AND MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELLING. RESULTS: OF THE 8009 WOMEN, 49% WERE OVERWEIGHT OR OBESE. SIXTY-FIVE PERCENT OF WOMEN WITH NORMAL BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) AND APPROXIMATELY 95% OF WOMEN WITH OVERWEIGHT/OBESITY WANTED TO LOSE WEIGHT. AT LEAST ONE IN FOUR WOMEN WITH NORMAL BMI WAS DISSATISFIED WITH BODY WEIGHT AND SHAPE, AS WERE MORE THAN TWO IN THREE WOMEN WITH OVERWEIGHT/OBESITY. THE MOST COMMON WEIGHT CONTROL METHODS INCLUDED EXERCISING (82.7%), CUTTING DOWN MEAL SIZES (76.8%), AND CUTTING DOWN SUGARS OR FATS (71.9%). YOGA/MEDITATION WAS PRACTICED FREQUENTLY BY 688 WOMEN (8.6%) AND OCCASIONALLY BY 1176 WOMEN (14.7%). YOGA/MEDITATION USERS WITH NORMAL BMI WERE LESS LIKELY DISSATISFIED WITH BODY WEIGHT AND SHAPE. ALL YOGA/MEDITATION USERS MORE LIKELY EXERCISED AND FOLLOWED A LOW GLYCEMIC DIET OR DIET BOOKS; AND WOMEN WITH OBESITY OCCASIONALLY USING YOGA/MEDITATION ALSO MORE LIKELY USED FASTING OR SMOKING TO LOSE WEIGHT. CONCLUSION: YOGA/MEDITATION USERS WITH NORMAL BMI APPEAR TO BE MORE SATISFIED WITH THEIR BODY WEIGHT AND SHAPE THAN NON-YOGA/MEDITATION USERS. WHILE WOMEN WITH NORMAL BMI OR OVERWEIGHT TEND TO RELY ON HEALTHY WEIGHT CONTROL METHODS, WOMEN WITH OBESITY OCCASIONAL USING YOGA/MEDITATION MAY MORE LIKELY UTILIZE UNHEALTHY WEIGHT CONTROL METHODS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
8  659  27 EFFECT OF 11 MONTHS OF YOGA TRAINING ON CARDIORESPIRATORY RESPONSES DURING THE ACTUAL PRACTICE OF SURYA NAMASKAR. BACKGROUND: SURYA NAMASKAR (SN), A POPULAR TRADITIONAL INDIAN YOGIC PRACTICE, INCLUDES PRACTICING 12 PHYSICAL POSTURES WITH ALTERNATE FORWARD AND BACKWARD BENDING MOVEMENT OF THE BODY ALONG WITH DEEP BREATHING MANEUVERS. THE PRACTICE OF SN HAS BECOME POPULAR AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND OTHER FITNESS CONSCIOUS PEOPLE. THE LONG-TERM EFFECT OF PRACTICING SN AND OTHER YOGIC PRACTICES ON CARDIORESPIRATORY RESPONSES DURING SN ARE LACKING. AIM: THE PRESENT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF YOGIC TRAINING ON VARIOUS CARDIORESPIRATORY RESPONSES DURING THE SN PRACTICE IN YOGA TRAINEES AFTER A TIME INTERVAL OF 3, 6, AND 11 MONTHS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THE PRESENT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON 9 HEALTHY MALE ARMY SOLDIERS WHO UNDERWENT TRAINING IN VARIOUS YOGA POSTURES INCLUDING SN, MEDITATION, AND PRANAYAMA FOR 1 H DAILY FOR 11 MONTHS. FIRST, SECOND, AND THIRD PHASE OF THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN THE LABORATORY AFTER COMPLETION OF 3, 6, AND 11 MONTHS OF THE YOGA TRAINING. THE PARTICIPANTS PERFORMED SN ALONG WITH OTHER YOGIC PRACTICES IN THE LABORATORY AS PER THEIR DAILY PRACTICE SCHEDULE. THE CARDIORESPIRATORY RESPONSES OF THE VOLUNTEERS WERE RECORDED DURING ACTUAL PRACTICE OF SN. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: ONE-WAY REPEATED MEASURE ANOVA FOLLOWED BY TUKEY HSD. RESULTS: OXYGEN CONSUMPTION AND HEART RATE DURING ACTUAL PRACTICE OF SN WAS 0.794 +/- 0.252, 0.738 +/- 0.229, AND 0.560 +/- 0.165 L/MIN AND 92.1 +/- 11.6, 97.9 +/- 7.3 AND 87.4 +/- 9.2 BEATS/MIN RESPECTIVELY AT 1(ST) , 2(ND) , AND 3(RD) PHASE OF YOGA TRAINING. MINUTE VENTILATION AND TIDAL VOLUME ALSO REDUCED FROM 19.9 +/- 4.65 TO 17.8 +/- 4.41 L/MIN AND 1.091 +/- 0.021 TO 0.952 L/BREATH FROM 1(ST) PHASE TO 3(RD) PHASE OF YOGA TRAINING. HOWEVER, RESPIRATORY PARAMETERS LIKE BREATHING RATE (FR) DID NOT SHOW ANY REDUCTION ACROSS THE THREE PHASES. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS OF THE PRESENT STUDY INDICATED THAT YOGIC TRAINING CAUSED CONDITIONING OF CARDIORESPIRATORY PARAMETERS EXCEPT FR, WHICH DID NOT REDUCE ACROSS THREE PHASES OF TRAINING.	2014	
                                                                                           
9 1120  22 EFFICACY OF HOT YOGA AS A HEAT STRESS TECHNIQUE FOR ENHANCING PLASMA VOLUME AND CARDIOVASCULAR PERFORMANCE IN ELITE FEMALE FIELD HOCKEY PLAYERS. PERROTTA, AS, WHITE, MD, KOEHLE, MS, TAUNTON, JE, AND WARBURTON, DER. EFFICACY OF HOT YOGA AS A HEAT STRESS TECHNIQUE FOR ENHANCING PLASMA VOLUME AND CARDIOVASCULAR PERFORMANCE IN ELITE FEMALE FIELD HOCKEY PLAYERS. J STRENGTH COND RES 32(10): 2878-2887, 2018-THIS INVESTIGATION EXAMINED THE EFFICACY OF HOT YOGA AS AN ALTERNATIVE HEAT STRESS TECHNIQUE FOR ENHANCING PLASMA VOLUME PERCENTAGE (PV%) AND CARDIOVASCULAR PERFORMANCE. TEN INTERNATIONAL CALIBER FEMALE FIELD HOCKEY PLAYERS COMPLETED SIX 60-MINUTE HOT YOGA SESSIONS USING PERMISSIVE DEHYDRATION OVER 6 DAYS, FOLLOWED BY A 6-DAY NATIONAL TEAM CAMP. CHANGES IN PV% WERE EXAMINED THROUGHOUT THE INTERVENTION AND POSTINTERVENTION PERIOD. A GRADED MAXIMAL EXERCISE TEST WAS PERFORMED IN A THERMONEUTRAL ENVIRONMENT (23.2 +/- 1.0 DEGREES C) 24 HOURS BEFORE AND 24 HOURS AFTER INTERVENTION. SIX DAYS OF HOT YOGA INITIATED A MODERATE STATE OF HYPOVOLEMIA (PV% = -3.5%, 90% CONFIDENCE LIMIT [CL] [-6.9 TO -0.13]), TRIVIAL IMPROVEMENTS IN MAXIMAL AEROBIC POWER (V[COMBINING DOT ABOVE]O2MAX) (EFFECT SIZE [ES] = 0.06, 90% CL [-0.16 TO 0.28]), AND RUN TIME TO EXHAUSTION (ES = 0.11, 90% CL [-0.07 TO 0.29]). SMALL MEANINGFUL IMPROVEMENTS WERE OBSERVED IN RUNNING SPEED (KM.H) AT VENTILATORY THRESHOLD (VT1) (ES = 0.34, 90% CL [-0.08 TO 0.76]), VT2 (ES = 0.53, 90% CL [-0.05 TO 1.1]), ALONG WITH ADAPTATIONS IN THE RESPIRATORY EXCHANGE RATIO DURING HIGH-INTENSITY EXERCISE (ES = -0.25, 90% CL [-0.62 TO 0.12]). A LARGE PLASMA VOLUME EXPANSION TRANSPIRED 72 HOURS AFTER INTERVENTION (PV% = 5.0%, 90% CL [1.3-8.7]) THAT CONTRACTED TO A SMALL EXPANSION AFTER 6 DAYS (PV% = 1.6%, 90% CL [-1.0 TO 4.2]). THIS INVESTIGATION PROVIDES PRACTITIONERS AN ALTERNATIVE HEAT STRESS TECHNIQUE CONDUCIVE FOR TEAM SPORT, INVOLVING MINIMAL EXERCISE STRESS THAT CAN PRESERVE MAXIMAL CARDIOVASCULAR PERFORMANCE OVER PERIODIZED REST WEEKS WITHIN THE YEARLY TRAINING PLAN. FURTHERMORE, IMPROVEMENTS IN SUBMAXIMAL PERFORMANCE AND A DELAYED HYPERVOLEMIC RESPONSE MAY PROVIDE A PERFORMANCE-ENHANCING EFFECT WHEN ENTERING A 6-DAY COMPETITION PERIOD.	2018	

10  775  18 EFFECT OF YOGA AND NATUROPATHY ON LIVER, RENAL AND CARDIORESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS OF A PATIENT WITH HEPATIC CIRRHOSIS WITH PORTAL HYPERTENSION AND ASCITES: A CASE REPORT. A 39-YEAR-OLD, MARRIED MAN WAS DIAGNOSED WITH HEPATIC CIRRHOSIS WITH PORTAL HYPERTENSION AND ASCITES IN FEBRUARY 2016. HIS SYMPTOMS AS DESCRIBED BY HIM BEGAN WITH GENERALIZED BODY WEAKNESS, BREATHLESSNESS AND SUDDEN WEIGHT GAIN OF 16KG WITHIN 3 WEEKS. HISTORY OF REGULAR INTAKE OF ALCOHOL SINCE 7 YEARS AND TREMENDOUS FAMILY STRESS WERE PRESENT. PATIENT UNDERWENT CONVENTIONAL MEDICATION FOR 6 MONTHS AND AYURVEDIC MEDICATIONS FOR 4 MONTHS. IN JANUARY 2017, HE VISITED OUR HOSPITAL WITH THE SAME COMPLAINTS AND UNDERWENT INTEGRATED NATUROPATHY AND YOGA THERAPIES (INYTS) FOR 4 WEEKS ALONG WITH AYURVEDA AND CONVENTIONAL MEDICATIONS. THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SHOWED A BETTER REDUCTION IN BODY WEIGHT, BODY MASS INDEX, ABDOMINAL GIRTH, SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE ALONG WITH IMPROVEMENT IN BREATH HOLDING TIME, HEMOGLOBIN LEVEL, LIVER FUNCTION TEST AND RENAL FUNCTION TEST. IT SUGGESTS THAT 4 WEEKS OF INYT WITH AYURVEDA AND CONVENTIONAL MEDICATIONS WAS EFFECTIVE IN PATIENTS WITH HEPATIC CIRRHOSIS WITH PORTAL HYPERTENSION AND ASCITES. FURTHER STUDIES ARE REQUIRED TO WARRANT THESE RESULTS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
11 2911  21 [PSEUDOARTHROSIS OF THE FIRST RIB IN A PATIENT WHO PRACTICES YOGA. A CASE REPORT]. INTRODUCTION: PSEUDOARTHROSIS OF THE FIRST RIB IS A RARE CONDITION THAT MAY OCCUR IN ATHLETES AS A RESULT OF REPETITIVE ACTIVITIES, MAINLY OVERHEAD. THE USUAL CLINICAL PRESENTATION IS PAIN IN THE NECK OR THE IPSILATERAL SHOULDER. CASE REPORT: THIS IS THE CASE OF A 19-YEAR-OLD FEMALE PATIENT WHO HAD SUDDEN PAIN OF THE BASE OF THE NECK WHILE DOING YOGA. PSEUDOARTHROSIS OF THE FIRST RIB WAS DIAGNOSED WITH X-RAYS AND CAT SCAN. TREATMENT CONSISTED OF A REHABILITATION AND PHYSICAL THERAPY PROGRAM THAT WAS SUCCESSFUL DESPITE THE PERSISTENCE OF THE PSEUDOARTHROSIS. DISCUSSION: CASES OF FIRST RIB FRACTURES HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN ATHLETES PRACTICING MULTIPLE ACTIVITIES; HOWEVER, PSEUDOARTHROSIS CASES ARE RARE SINCE MOST OF THEM PROGRESS TO BONE HEALING. THIS IS THE FIRST REPORTED CASE OF A FRACTURE OR PSEUDOARTHROSIS IN A PATIENT PRACTICING YOGA. AS IN MOST REPORTED CASES, CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT WAS SUCCESSFUL. CONCLUSION: FRACTURES AND PSEUDOARTHROSIS OF THE FIRST RIB ARE RARE IN ATHLETES AND SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF ATHLETES PRESENTING WITH SHOULDER AND NECK PAIN. CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT IS SUCCESSFUL IN MOST CASES.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
12 1498  27 INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE CHANGES AND OCULAR BIOMETRY DURING SIRSASANA (HEADSTAND POSTURE) IN YOGA PRACTITIONERS. PURPOSE: TO STUDY THE INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE (IOP) CHANGES IN SIRSASANA (HEADSTAND POSTURE) DONE BY EXPERIENCED YOGA PRACTITIONERS AND CORRELATE THE OCULAR BIOMETRIC PARAMETERS WITH THE IOP CHANGES, AND TO SCREEN FOR THE PREVALENCE OF OCULAR HYPERTENSION IN THIS GROUP OF SUBJECTS. DESIGN: PROSPECTIVE CASE OBSERVATIONAL SERIES. PARTICIPANTS: SEVENTY-FIVE SUBJECTS (50 ASIAN INDIANS AND 25 CAUCASIANS) FROM A YOGA TRAINING INSTITUTE VOLUNTEERED FOR THE STUDY. METHODS: ALL PARTICIPANTS UNDERWENT A DETAILED OPHTHALMIC EXAMINATION ALONG WITH OCULAR BIOMETRY AND CORNEAL PACHYMETRY. INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE WAS RECORDED USING A TONOPEN BEFORE, DURING, AND AFTER THE SIRSASANA. CHANGES WERE COMPARED USING THE PAIRED T TEST. AGE, AXIAL LENGTH, ANTERIOR CHAMBER DEPTH, LENS THICKNESS, CORNEAL CURVATURE, CORNEAL THICKNESS, RACE, AND THE LENGTH OF TIME FOR WHICH THE PRACTITIONER WAS PERFORMING YOGA WERE CORRELATED WITH THE INDUCED IOP DIFFERENCE IN A RANDOMLY SELECTED EYE USING PEARSON'S CORRELATION COEFFICIENT WITH BONFERRONI CORRECTION FOR MULTIPLE COMPARISONS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: OCULAR BIOMETRY AND INDUCED IOP DIFFERENCE. RESULTS: THE MEAN INCREASE IN IOP AT BASELINE AND IMMEDIATELY AFTER ASSUMING SIRSASANA WAS 15.1+/-4.1 MMHG (R = 0.07; P = 0.999) AND AFTER 5 MINUTES WAS 15.8+/-4.6 MMHG (R = -0.25; P = 0.357). THE INDUCED INCREASE IN IOP DURING THE POSTURE WAS TWICE THE BASELINE IOP. THERE WAS NO CORRELATION BETWEEN AGE, OCULAR BIOMETRY, AND ULTRASOUND PACHYMETRY WHEN COMPARED WITH THE INDUCED IOP DIFFERENCE. ONE SUBJECT (1.33%) WAS FOUND TO HAVE BASELINE IOP OF MORE THAN 21 MMHG. CONCLUSION: THERE WAS A UNIFORM 2-FOLD INCREASE IN THE IOP DURING SIRSASANA, WHICH WAS MAINTAINED DURING THE POSTURE IN ALL AGE GROUPS IRRESPECTIVE OF THE OCULAR BIOMETRY AND ULTRASOUND PACHYMETRY. WE DID NOT DEMONSTRATE A HIGHER PREVALENCE OF OCULAR HYPERTENSIVES IN THIS COHORT OF YOGA PRACTITIONERS NOR DID THE RISK FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO GLAUCOMA SHOW ANY CORRELATION WITH MAGNITUDE OF IOP RAISE DURING THE POSTURE.	2006	
                                                                                          
13 1396  15 IMPACT OF YOGA IN A CASE OF VOCAL CORD DYSFUNCTION WITH DYSAUTONOMIA. A 23-YEAR-OLD FEMALE WITH A PAST MEDICAL HISTORY OF GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE PRESENTED WITH SHORTNESS OF BREATH INDUCED BY EXERCISE AND CERTAIN ODORS. SHE REPORTED THE SYMPTOMS OF AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION INCLUDING FATIGUE, CHEST PAIN, LIGHTHEADEDNESS, HEADACHES, NUMBNESS/TINGLING IN THE ARMS AND LEGS, AND EXERCISE INTOLERANCE. VITAL SIGNS WERE SIGNIFICANT FOR ORTHOSTATIC INTOLERANCE. VOLUME FLOW LOOP IN THE PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS SHOWED A FLATTENING OF THE INSPIRATORY PORTION CHARACTERISTIC OF VOCAL CORD DYSFUNCTION.

14 2052  30 THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN REGULAR YOGA AND MEDITATION PRACTICE AND FALLS AND INJURIES: RESULTS OF A NATIONAL CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY AMONG AUSTRALIAN WOMEN. INTRODUCTION: FALLS ARE THE LEADING CAUSE OF INJURIES IN WOMEN ACROSS ALL AGES. WHILE YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO INCREASE BALANCE, IT HAS ALSO BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH INJURIES DUE TO FALLS DURING PRACTICE. THIS STUDY AIMED TO ANALYSE WHETHER REGULAR YOGA OR MEDITATION PRACTICE IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FREQUENCY OF FALLS AND FALL-RELATED INJURIES IN UPPER MIDDLE-AGED AUSTRALIAN WOMEN. METHODS: WOMEN AGED 59-64 YEARS FROM THE AUSTRALIAN LONGITUDINAL STUDY ON WOMEN'S HEALTH (ALSWH) WERE QUERIED REGARDING FALLS AND FALLS-RELATED INJURIES; AND WHETHER THEY REGULARLY PRACTICED YOGA OR MEDITATION. ASSOCIATIONS OF FALLS AND FALLS-RELATED INJURIES WITH YOGA OR MEDITATION PRACTICE WERE ANALYSED USING CHI-SQUARED TESTS AND MULTIPLE LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELLING. RESULTS: OF 10,011 WOMEN, 4413 (44.1%) HAD SLIPPED, TRIPPED OR STUMBLED, 2770 (27.7%) HAD FALLEN TO THE GROUND, 1398 (14.0%) HAD BEEN INJURED AS A RESULT OF FALLING, AND 901 (9.0%) WOMEN HAD SOUGHT MEDICAL ATTENTION FOR A FALL-RELATED INJURY WITHIN THE PREVIOUS 12 MONTHS. YOGA OR MEDITATION WAS PRACTICED REGULARLY BY 746 (7.5%) WOMEN. NO ASSOCIATIONS OF FALLS, FALL-RELATED INJURIES AND TREATMENT DUE TO FALLS-RELATED INJURY WITH YOGA OR MEDITATION PRACTICE WERE FOUND. DISCUSSION: NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN YOGA OR MEDITATION PRACTICE AND FALLS OR FALL-RELATED INJURIES HAVE BEEN FOUND. FURTHER STUDIES ARE WARRANTED FOR CONCLUSIVE JUDGEMENT OF BENEFITS AND SAFETY OF YOGA AND MEDITATION IN RELATION TO BALANCE, FALLS AND FALL-RELATED INJURIES.	2016

THE CASE IS REPORTED OF A YOGA PRACTITIONER WHO, DURING AN EXACERBATION OF ASTHMA, DEVELOPED A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN SERUM MUSCLE ENZYMES. THIS WAS RELATED TO HIS YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES, WHICH HE USED TO ENHANCE THE DELIVERY OF AEROSOLISED BRONCHODILATORS. AS HIS CONDITION IMPROVED AND THE USE OF THESE YOGA MANOEUVRES DIMINISHED, THE MUSCLE ENZYME LEVELS FELL TO NORMAL.	1988	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
16 1485  23 INTEGRATIVE APPROACH COMBINING AYURVEDA, COUNSELLING, YOGA AND MEDITATION WITH CONVENTIONAL MANAGEMENT OF ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS - A CASE REPORT. LIFELONG MEDICATIONS ARE REQUIRED FOR SYMPTOMATIC RELIEF IN ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS (AS). WE REPORT THE POTENTIAL OF AN INTEGRATIVE APPROACH IN REDUCING DEPENDENCE ON STEROIDS AND PAIN MEDICATIONS IN CHRONIC AS. A 59-YEAR-OLD HLA-B27 POSITIVE MALE PATIENT SUFFERING FROM AS FOR 40 YEARS SOUGHT AYURVEDIC TREATMENT FOR RELAPSE OF PAIN, STIFFNESS, FATIGUE, INTERMITTENT CONSTIPATION AND DISTURBED SLEEP. AYURVEDIC DIAGNOSIS WAS AMAVATA (A CLINICAL CONDITION CHARACTERISED BY JOINT INFLAMMATION) THE PATIENT WAS MANAGED AS OUTPATIENT FOR ELEVEN DAYS AND HOSPITALISED FOR THIRTY THREE DAYS. INTERNAL MEDICINES AND EXTERNAL THERAPIES WITH DIET MODIFICATION, LIFESTYLE ADJUSTMENTS, COUNSELLING, YOGA AND IAM TECHNIQUE (INTEGRATED AMRITA MEDITATION TECHNIQUE ) WERE ADMINISTERED DURING THE HOSPITAL STAY. AT YEARLY FOLLOW UP, C-REACTIVE PROTEIN WAS REDUCED TO 15.7 MG/L FROM THE BASELINE VALUE OF 37.5 MG/L, AND ESR FROM 103 MM/H TO 8 MM/H INDICATING REDUCTION IN INFLAMMATION. THE DOSE OF NSAID AND DMARD (DISEASE MODIFYING ANTIRHEUMATIC DRUG) COULD BE REDUCED FROM ONCE IN TWENTY-FOUR HOURS TO ONCE IN EIGHTY-FOUR HOURS AND STEROIDS FROM TWICE DAILY TO ONCE IN A WEEK. THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN PAIN AND STIFFNESS. INTEGRATION OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA WITH CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT CAN REDUCE DRUG DEPENDENCE AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE IN AS.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
17 1914  21 ROLE OF INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY IN A FAILED POST-TOTAL KNEE REPLACEMENT OF BILATERAL KNEES. OA KNEE IS THE MOST COMMON ARTHRITIS. KNEE REPLACEMENT SURGERIES ARE BEING DONE INCREASINGLY IN THE PRESENT TIMES. THIS HAS LED TO THE VIOLATION OF THE STANDARD INDICATIONS AND WHEN KNEES ARE REPLACED IGNORING OTHER CO - MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS IT RESULTS IN THE SURGERY FAILING EARLY. THIS IS ABOUT A PATIENT WHO ENCOUNTERED A FAILED TKR DUE TO IMPROPER SELECTION AS PATIENT HAD BILATERAL OA HIP THAT WAS IGNORED IN THE INITIAL STAGES. TO OVERCOME THE PROBLEM SHE WAS ADVISED BILATERAL HIP REPLACEMENT WHICH WOULD LEAVE HER WITH FOUR REPLACEMENTS IN THE LOWER LIMB. SHE REFUSED SURGERY AND WAS TOLD THERE ARE NO ALTERNATIVE TREATMENT OPTIONS. THIS PATIENT UNDERWENT A 3 WEEK INTEGRATED COURSE OF IAYT AT OUR CENTER AND SHE MADE A REMARKABLE RECOVERY. IAYT IS A GOOD NON-SURGICAL TREATMENT THAT CAN BE AFFECTIVE BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER KNEE REPLACEMENT AND IT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AS THE FIRST CHOICE OF TREATMENT BEFORE SURGERY.	2014

THE PRESENT ANALYSIS INVESTIGATED TEMPORAL TRENDS IN PHYSICAL APPEARANCE ATTRIBUTES AND ATTIRE WORN BY FEMALE COVER MODELS OF YOGA JOURNAL MAGAZINE BETWEEN THE YEARS 1975-2015. COVERS FEATURING A SINGLE FEMALE MODEL (N=168) WERE CODED FOR: POSE ACTIVITY, AMOUNT OF BODY VISIBILITY, PERCEIVED BODY SIZE, BODY SHAPE, BREAST SIZE, SKIN EXPOSURE, AND REVEALING OR FORM-FITTING ATTIRE. WHEN COLLAPSED ACROSS ALL DECADES, THE MAJORITY OF COVER MODELS WAS ACTIVELY POSED WITH HIGH BODY VISIBILITY, RATED AS AT MOST LOW NORMAL WEIGHT, POSSESSED EITHER A "THIN/LEAN" OR "SKINNY/BONEY" BODY SHAPE, AND WERE "FLAT-CHESTED" OR "SMALL-BREASTED". GREATER BODY VISIBILITY, POSE ACTIVITY, THINNESS/LEANNESS, SKIN EXPOSURE, AND FORM-FITTING ATTIRE WERE FEATURED ON MORE RECENT YEARS' COVERS. FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE FEMALE "YOGA BODY" CONFORMS TO THE CONTEMPORARY THIN- AND-TONED MEDIA FITNESS IDEAL, PARTICULARLY RECENTLY, WHICH MAY PROMOTE OBJECTIFIED BODY COMPETENCE, AN UNHEALTHY DRIVE FOR LEANNESS, AND DISSUADE HIGHER WEIGHT WOMEN FROM CONSIDERING YOGA PRACTICE.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
19 1570  27 MANAGEMENT OF ACUTE CALCULUS CHOLECYSTITIS WITH INTEGRATED AYURVEDA AND YOGA INTERVENTION: A CASE REPORT. ACUTE CALCULUS CHOLECYSTITIS (ACC) IS A FREQUENTLY REPORTED MEDICAL CONDITION IN GENERAL PRACTICE. APPROXIMATELY 20% OF PATIENTS WITH GALLBLADDER STONES EXPERIENCE ACC IN THEIR LIFETIME. AYURVEDA AND YOGA ARE ANCIENT TRADITIONAL SYSTEMS OF MEDICINE USED FOR TREATMENT OF DISEASES AND IMPROVING AND MAINTAINING HEALTH. THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASED USE OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SEVERAL HEALTH CONDITIONS IN INDIA AND WORLDWIDE. THE PRESENT CASE STUDY IS OF 34 YEARS FEMALE PATIENT WHO HAD ACC. POST DIAGNOSIS OF ACC PATIENT WAS ADVISED TO UNDERGO CHOLECYSTECTOMY; HOWEVER, SHE APPROACHED ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES WITH C/O VOMITING, NAUSEA, ABDOMINAL PAIN, JAUNDICE, ITCHING, AND ABDOMINAL BLOATING WITH DERANGED LIVER FUNCTIONS. AYURVEDA AND YOGA INTERVENTION PROTOCOL WAS DESIGNED. AYURVEDA TREATMENT CONSISTED OF MILD PURGATION (MRUDUVIRECHANA) WITH TRIVRITTALEHYAM FOR CONSECUTIVE SEVEN DAYS, FOLLOWED BY ORAL ADMINISTRATION OF TAB LIV 52, BHUNIMBADI KADHA TWICE DAILY, AND AMALAKI RASAYANA IN THE MORNING FOR 45 DAYS. PATIENTS RECEIVED 8 TELEYOGA SESSIONS OVER A PERIOD OF 45 DAYS. A THERAPEUTIC DIET WAS ADVISED DURING TREATMENT PERIOD. AFTER TWO MONTHS PATIENT REPORTED COMPLETE RECOVERY IN SYMPTOMS, AND ALL LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS REACHED TO NORMAL RANGE. THIS CASE STUDY SUGGESTS THE POSITIVE ROLE OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA INTERVENTION IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ACC. THIS CASE REPORT WARRANTS FUTURE CLINICAL STUDIES ON INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE IN ACC.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
20 1905  25 RETURN TO YOGA RATES ARE HIGH AFTER VOLAR PLATING OF DISTAL RADIUS FRACTURES. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS A POPULAR ACTIVITY INVOLVING EXTREME WRIST POSITIONING AND EXTENSION LOADING. OUR PURPOSE WAS TO QUANTIFY THE PREVALENCE OF PREOPERATIVE YOGA PARTICIPATION AND CHARACTERIZE SUBSEQUENT ABILITY TO RETURN TO YOGA IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING VOLAR LOCKED PLATING OF DISTAL RADIUS FRACTURES. METHODS: WE RETROSPECTIVELY REVIEWED ALL CASES OF DISTAL RADIUS OPEN REDUCTION INTERNAL FIXATION BETWEEN AUGUST 2015 AND MARCH 2017. PATIENTS WERE INCLUDED IF THEY WERE TREATED WITH VOLAR LOCKED PLATING AND IF THEY PARTICIPATED IN YOGA ON A REGULAR BASIS PREOPERATIVELY. PATIENTS WERE CONTACTED AT A MINIMUM OF 1 YEAR POSTOPERATIVELY AND SURVEYED ABOUT YOGA PARTICIPATION. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 149 PATIENTS WHO UNDERWENT DISTAL RADIUS VOLAR PLATING WERE SURVEYED. THIRTY-ONE PATIENTS (32 PROCEDURES, 20.8% OF SURVEYED PATIENTS) PARTICIPATED IN YOGA ON A REGULAR BASIS PREOPERATIVELY. OVERALL, 90.3% RETURNED TO YOGA IN SOME CAPACITY. MEAN TIMES TO RETURN TO YOGA IN ANY CAPACITY, WITH WEIGHT-BEARING, AND IN A "STEADY STATE" WERE 5.7, 7.4, AND 10.0 MONTHS, RESPECTIVELY. OF PATIENTS WHO RESUMED YOGA, 65.5% RETURNED TO THE SAME OR BETTER LEVEL OF YOGA. SATISFACTION WITH PARTICIPATION IN YOGA WAS 8.9 (OUT OF 10). CONCLUSIONS: WE FOUND A RELATIVELY HIGH YOGA PARTICIPATION RATE IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING DISTAL RADIUS FRACTURE FIXATION, SUGGESTING THE NEED TO BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY COUNSEL THESE PATIENTS. OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE A HIGH RATE OF RETURN TO YOGA, ALTHOUGH APPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OF PATIENTS EXPERIENCED A DECREASED LEVEL OF PARTICIPATION. SURGEONS CAN USE THIS INFORMATION TO SET APPROPRIATE EXPECTATIONS.	2021

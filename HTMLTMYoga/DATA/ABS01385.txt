1 1385 144 IMPACT OF RELAXATION TRAINING ACCORDING TO YOGA IN DAILY LIFE(R) SYSTEM ON SELF-ESTEEM AFTER BREAST CANCER SURGERY. OBJECTIVES: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO GATHER INFORMATION ON THE IMMEDIATE AND SHORT-TERM EFFECTS OF RELAXATION TRAINING ACCORDING TO THE YOGA IN DAILY LIFE((R)) SYSTEM ON THE SELF-ESTEEM OF PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. DESIGN: THIS IS A PARALLEL-GROUPS DESIGN. SETTINGS/LOCATION: BASELINE INTERVENTIONS TOOK PLACE AT THE INSTITUTE FOR ONCOLOGY OF LJUBLJANA (SLOVENIA). AT DISCHARGE, THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS ISSUED WITH AUDIOCASSETTE RECORDINGS CONTAINING THE INSTRUCTIONS FOR RELAXATION TRAINING TO BE PRACTICED INDIVIDUALLY AT HOME FOR AN ADDITIONAL 3 WEEKS. SUBJECTS: THE CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF 32 PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER WAS RECRUITED FROM AN ACCESSIBLE POPULATION OF HOSPITALIZED WOMEN. PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO THE EXPERIMENTAL (N=16) AND TO THE CONTROL GROUP (N=16). INTERVENTIONS: BOTH GROUPS RECEIVED THE SAME STANDARD PHYSIOTHERAPY FOR 1 WEEK, WHILE THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP ADDITIONALLY RECEIVED A GROUP RELAXATION TRAINING SESSIONS ACCORDING TO THE YOGA IN DAILY LIFE((R)) SYSTEM. AT DISCHARGE, THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS ISSUED WITH AUDIOCASSETTE RECORDINGS CONTAINING SIMILAR INSTRUCTIONS FOR RELAXATION TRAINING TO BE PRACTICED INDIVIDUALLY AT HOME FOR AN ADDITIONAL 3 WEEKS. OUTCOME MEASURES: OUTCOME MEASURES WERE OBTAINED BY BLINDED INVESTIGATORS (PHYSIOTHERAPISTS) USING STANDARDIZED QUESTIONNAIRES (ROSENBERG SELF-ESTEEM SCALE) AT BASELINE (AFTER THE SURGERY); AT 1 WEEK (1 WEEK POSTATTENDANCE; AT DISCHARGE); AND AT 4 WEEKS (4 WEEKS POSTATTENDANCE); PRIOR THE COMMENCEMENT OF RADIATION. RESULTS: ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE SHOWED THAT THERE WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUP IN ALL MEASURING SELF-ESTEEM SCORES OVER THE STUDY PERIOD (P<0.0005). AT THE SAME TIME, THE CONTROL GROUP'S SCORES REMAINED UNCHANGED OVER THE STUDY PERIOD (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT RELAXATION TRAINING ACCORDING TO THE YOGA IN DAILY LIFE SYSTEM COULD BE A USEFUL CLINICAL PHYSIOTHERAPY INTERVENTION FOR PATIENTS WHO HAVE BREAST CANCER AND WHO ARE EXPERIENCING LOW SELF-ESTEEM. ALTHOUGH THIS KIND OF RELAXATION TRAINING CAN BE APPLIED TO CLINICAL ONCOLOGY IN SLOVENIA, MORE STUDIES NEED TO BE DONE.	2011	
                                     
2 1384 104 IMPACT OF RELAXATION TRAINING ACCORDING TO YOGA IN DAILY LIFE(R) SYSTEM ON PERCEIVED STRESS AFTER BREAST CANCER SURGERY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO GATHER INFORMATION ON THE IMMEDIATE AND SHORT-TERM EFFECTS OF RELAXATION TRAINING ACCORDING TO YOGA IN DAILY LIFE((R)) (YIDL) SYSTEM ON THE PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. 32 PATIENTS AT THE INSTITUTE FOR ONCOLOGY OF LJUBLJANA WERE RANDOMIZED TO THE EXPERIMENTAL (N=16) AND TO THE CONTROL GROUP (N=16). BOTH GROUPS RECEIVED THE SAME STANDARD PHYSIOTHERAPY FOR 1 WEEK, WHILE THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP ADDITIONALLY RECEIVED A GROUP RELAXATION TRAINING SESSIONS ACCORDING TO YIDL((R)) SYSTEM. AT DISCHARGE THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS ISSUED WITH AUDIOCASSETTE RECORDINGS CONTAINING THE SIMILAR INSTRUCTIONS FOR RELAXATION TRAINING TO BE PRACTICED INDIVIDUALLY AT HOME (FOR FURTHER 3 WEEKS). AN EXPERIMENTAL REPEATED MEASURES DESIGN WAS USED TO INVESTIGATE THE DIFFERENCES OVER 1 MONTH PERIOD IN STRESS LEVELS, CHANGES IN MENTAL HEALTH AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PARAMETERS. MEASURES WERE OBTAINED AT THREE TIME POINTS DURING THE STUDY PERIOD: BASELINE, AT 1 WEEK, AND AT 4 WEEKS, BY BLINDED INVESTIGATORS USING STANDARDIZED QUESTIONNAIRES GENERAL HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE-12 (GHQ-12), ROTTERDAM SYMPTOM CHECKLIST (RSCL) PSYCHOLOGICAL SUBSCALE, PERCEIVED STRESS SCALE (PSS). PATIENTS WHO RECEIVED RELAXATION TRAINING REPORTED FEELING SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DISTRESSED DURING HOSPITALIZATION AND AFTER DISCHARGE-PERIOD THAN DID THE CONTROLS THAT DID NOT RECEIVE RELAXATION TRAINING. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT RELAXATION TRAINING ACCORDING TO YOGA IN DAILY LIFE((R)) SYSTEM COULD BE USEFUL CLINICAL PHYSIOTHERAPY INTERVENTION FOR BREAST CANCER PATIENTS EXPERIENCING PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. ALTHOUGH THIS KIND OF RELAXATION TRAINING CAN BE APPLIED TO CLINICAL ONCOLOGY IN SLOVENIA, MORE STUDIES NEED TO BE DONE.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
3 1383  80 IMPACT OF RELAXATION TRAINING ACCORDING TO THE YOGA IN DAILY LIFE(R) SYSTEM ON ANXIETY AFTER BREAST CANCER SURGERY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO GATHER INFORMATION ON THE IMMEDIATE AND SHORT-TERM EFFECTS OF RELAXATION TRAINING ACCORDING TO THE YOGA IN DAILY LIFE(R) (YIDL(R)) SYSTEM ON ANXIETY OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. THE YIDL(R) SYSTEM IS A HOLISTIC SYSTEM BEING PRACTISED AND TAUGHT WORLDWIDE AND HAS BEEN PROVEN TO BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN THE PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF VARIOUS DISEASES. THE SYSTEM AIMS TO ESTABLISH PHYSICAL, MENTAL, SPIRITUAL, AND SOCIAL HEALTH. THIRTY-TWO PATIENTS AT THE INSTITUTE FOR ONCOLOGY LJUBLJANA WERE RANDOMIZED TO THE EXPERIMENTAL (N=16) AND TO THE CONTROL GROUPS (N=16). BOTH GROUPS RECEIVED THE SAME STANDARD PHYSIOTHERAPY FOR 1 WEEK, WHILE THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP ADDITIONALLY RECEIVED 1-HOUR GROUP RELAXATION TRAINING SESSION ACCORDING TO THE YIDL(R) SYSTEM PER DAY. AT DISCHARGE, THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP WAS ISSUED WITH AUDIOCASSETTE RECORDINGS CONTAINING SIMILAR INSTRUCTIONS FOR RELAXATION TRAINING TO BE PRACTICED FOR 3 WEEKS INDIVIDUALLY AT HOME. ANXIETY MEASURES WERE OBTAINED BY BLINDED ASSESSORS USING STANDARDIZED QUESTIONNAIRES. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT RELAXATION TRAINING ACCORDING TO THE YIDL(R) SYSTEM COULD BE A USEFUL CLINICAL PHYSIOTHERAPY INTERVENTION FOR BREAST CANCER PATIENTS EXPERIENCING ANXIETY.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
4 1076  44 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PHYSIOLOGICAL INDICES, ANXIETY AND SOCIAL FUNCTIONING IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PATIENTS: A RANDOMIZED TRIAL. INTRODUCTION: MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) AS A CHRONIC DISEASE COULD AFFECT PATIENTS' VARIOUS DOMAINS OF LIFE. AIM: THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON THE PHYSIOLOGICAL INDICES, ANXIETY AND SOCIAL FUNCTIONING OF PATIENTS WITH MS IN SOUTHWEST, IRAN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IN THIS CLINICAL TRIAL STUDY, 60 MS PATIENTS WERE ENROLLED ACCORDING TO INCLUSION CRITERIA AND RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO TWO GROUPS OF 30 EACH. PRIOR TO AND AFTER INTERVENTION, THE PATIENTS' VITAL SIGNS WERE MEASURED. FOR CASE GROUP YOGA EXERCISES WERE PERFORMED THREE SESSIONS A WEEK FOR 12 WEEKS WHILE CONTROL GROUP PERFORMED NO EXERCISE. THE DATA WERE GATHERED BY QUESTIONNAIRE AND ANALYSED BY DESCRIPTIVE AND ANALYTICAL STATISTICS IN SPSS. RESULTS: PRIOR TO INTERVENTION, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN FATIGUE SEVERITY AND PAIN BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS BUT THE MEAN FATIGUE SEVERITY AND PAIN IN CASE GROUP DECREASED COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP AFTER THE INTERVENTION. PRIOR TO INTERVENTION, THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN MEAN PHYSIOLOGICAL INDICES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS BUT THE MEAN PHYSIOLOGICAL INDICES IN CASE GROUP DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER THE INTERVENTION (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: YOGA IS LIKELY TO INCREASE SELF-EFFICACY OF MS PATIENTS THROUGH ENHANCING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, INCREASING THE STRENGTH OF LOWER LIMBS AND BALANCE, AND DECREASING FATIGUE AND PAIN, AND FINALLY TO PROMOTE SOCIAL FUNCTIONING AND TO RELIEVE STRESS AND ANXIETY IN THESE PATIENTS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
5  159  43 A RANDOMISED COMPARATIVE TRIAL OF YOGA AND RELAXATION TO REDUCE STRESS AND ANXIETY. OBJECTIVE: TO COMPARE YOGA AND RELAXATION AS TREATMENT MODALITIES AT 10 AND 16 WEEKS FROM STUDY BASELINE TO DETERMINE IF EITHER OF MODALITY REDUCES SUBJECT STRESS, ANXIETY, BLOOD PRESSURE AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE. DESIGN: A RANDOMISED COMPARATIVE TRIAL WAS UNDERTAKEN COMPARING YOGA WITH RELAXATION. PARTICIPANTS: ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-ONE SUBJECTS WITH MILD TO MODERATE LEVELS OF STRESS WERE RECRUITED FROM THE COMMUNITY IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA. INTERVENTIONS: TEN WEEKLY 1- H SESSIONS OF RELAXATION OR HATHA YOGA. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CHANGES IN THE STATE TRAIT PERSONALITY INVENTORY SUB-SCALE ANXIETY, GENERAL HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE AND THE SHORT FORM-36. RESULTS: FOLLOWING THE 10 WEEK INTERVENTION STRESS, ANXIETY AND QUALITY OF LIFE SCORES IMPROVED OVER TIME. YOGA WAS FOUND TO BE AS EFFECTIVE AS RELAXATION IN REDUCING STRESS, ANXIETY AND IMPROVING HEALTH STATUS ON SEVEN DOMAINS OF THE SF-36. YOGA WAS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN RELAXATION IN IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH. AT THE END OF THE 6 WEEK FOLLOW-UP PERIOD THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS IN LEVELS OF STRESS, ANXIETY AND ON FIVE DOMAINS OF THE SF-36. VITALITY, SOCIAL FUNCTION AND MENTAL HEALTH SCORES ON THE SF-36 WERE HIGHER IN THE RELAXATION GROUP DURING THE FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. CONCLUSION: YOGA APPEARS TO PROVIDE A COMPARABLE IMPROVEMENT IN STRESS, ANXIETY AND HEALTH STATUS COMPARED TO RELAXATION.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
6 2864  48 YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION FOR CAREGIVERS OF OUTPATIENTS WITH PSYCHOSIS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY. PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: THE USE OF YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR CAREGIVERS OF PATIENTS WITH PSYCHOSIS HAS BEEN POORLY STUDIED. THE CURRENT STUDY AIMED TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF A BRIEF YOGA PROGRAM AS AN INTERVENTION IN CAREGIVERS OF OUTPATIENTS WITH FUNCTIONAL PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS USING A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED RESEARCH DESIGN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CAREGIVERS WHO AGREED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY (N=29) WERE RANDOMIZED INTO YOGA (N=15) OR WAIT-LIST GROUP (N=14). THEY WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND AT THE END OF 3 MONTHS. PATIENTS WHO WERE RANDOMIZED INTO THE YOGA GROUP WERE OFFERED SUPERVISED YOGA TRAINING THRICE A WEEK FOR 4 WEEKS, AFTER WHICH THEY WERE INSTRUCTED TO PRACTICE AT HOME FOR THE NEXT 2 MONTHS. DUE TO THE SMALL SAMPLE SIZE AND SOME VARIABLES NOT BEING NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED, NON-PARAMETRIC STATISTICAL ANALYSIS WAS USED. RESULTS: RESULTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BURDEN SCORES AND IMPROVED QUALITY OF LIFE SCORES IN THE YOGA GROUP AS COMPARED TO THE WAIT-LIST GROUP AT THE END OF 3 MONTHS. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCORES IN CAREGIVERS, OR PSYCHOPATHOLOGY SCORES IN PATIENTS. CONCLUSION: IN CAREGIVERS OF OUTPATIENTS WITH FUNCTIONAL PSYCHOSIS, 4 WEEKS OF TRAINING FOLLOWED BY 3 MONTHS OF HOME PRACTICE OF A YOGA MODULE OFFERED SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE OVER WAITLIST. YOGA CAN BE OFFERED AS AN INTERVENTION FOR CAREGIVERS OF PATIENTS WITH SEVERE MENTAL DISORDERS. METHODS OF PROVIDING YOGA INTERVENTION CLOSER TO THE COMMUNITY OR USE OF FLEXIBLE MODULES AT HOSPITALS NEEDS FURTHER STUDY.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
7  511  50 COMPARATIVE STUDY OF CONVENTIONAL THERAPY AND ADDITIONAL YOGASANAS FOR KNEE REHABILITATION AFTER TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY. BACKGROUND: AMONGST VARIOUS MODALITIES OF POST OPERATIVE REHABILITATION IN A TOTAL KNEE REPLACEMENT (TKR) SURGERY, THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON EVALUATING THE EFFECT OF ADDITIONAL YOGA THERAPY ON FUNCTIONAL OUTCOME OF TKR PATIENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A COMPARATIVE STUDY WAS DONE TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF CONVENTIONAL PHYSIOTHERAPY AND ADDITIONAL YOGA ASANAS, ON 56 PATIENTS UNDERGOING TOTAL KNEE ARTHROPLASTY DUE TO OSTEOARTHRITIS. AFTER OBTAINING WRITTEN INFORMED CONSENT, THE PATIENTS WERE ALTERNATELY ASSIGNED TO TWO GROUPS: CONVENTIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL. BASELINE WOMAC SCORES FOR PAIN AND STIFFNESS WERE TAKEN ON THIRD POST OPERATIVE DAY. THE SUBJECTS IN CONVENTIONAL GROUP RECEIVED PHYSIOTHERAPY REHABILITATION PROGRAM OF SANCHETI INSTITUTE WHERE THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED, THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP RECEIVED ADDITIONAL MODIFIED YOGA ASANAS ONCE DAILY BY THE THERAPIST. AFTER DISCHARGE FROM THE HOSPITAL, PATIENTS WERE PROVIDED WITH WRITTEN INSTRUCTIONS AND PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE ASANAS, TWO SETS OF WOMAC QUESTIONNAIRE WITH STAMPED AND ADDRESSED ENVELOPES AND WERE INSTRUCTED TO PERFORM YOGA ASANAS 3 DAYS/WEEK. SUBJECTS FILLED THE QUESTIONNAIRE AFTER 6 WEEKS AND 3 MONTHS FROM THE DAY OF SURGERY AND MAILED BACK. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURE WAS WOMAC QUESTIONNAIRE WHICH CONSISTS OF 24 QUESTIONS, EACH CORRESPONDING TO A VISUAL ANALOG SCALE, DESIGNED TO MEASURE PATIENT'S PERCEPTION OF PAIN, STIFFNESS AND FUNCTION. RESULTS: THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE (P<0.05) FOR ALL THE GROUPS FOR PAIN, STIFFNESS AND FUNCTION SUBSCALES OF WOMAC SCALE. THE PAIN AND STIFFNESS WAS FOUND TO BE LESS IN EXPERIMENTAL GROUP RECEIVING ADDITIONAL YOGA THERAPY THAN IN CONVENTIONAL GROUP ON 3(RD) POST OPERATIVE DAY, 6 WEEKS AND 3 MONTHS AFTER THE SURGERY. CONCLUSION: A COMBINATION OF PHYSIOTHERAPY AND YOGA ASANA PROTOCOL WORKS BETTER THAN ONLY PHYSIOTHERAPY PROTOCOL. LARGER AND BLINDED STUDY IS NEEDED.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
8 1091  45 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN CANCER PATIENTS. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY SOUGHT TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. DESIGN: TWENTY PATIENTS BETWEEN 30 AND 50 YEARS OF AGE PRESENTLY UNDER TREATMENT FOR BREAST CANCER WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. THE PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PATIENTS WERE RECORDED AND GENERAL PHYSIOTHERAPY ASSESSMENTS PERFORMED. EIGHT SESSIONS OF A YOGA PROGRAM INCLUDING WARMING AND BREATHING EXERCISES, ASANAS, RELAXATION IN SUPINE POSITION, AND MEDITATION WERE APPLIED TO PARTICIPANTS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: THE PRE- AND POST-YOGA QUALITY OF LIFE ASSESSMENTS FOR THE PATIENTS WERE CONDUCTED USING THE NOTTINGHAM HEALTH PROFILE (NHP). PATIENTS' STRESS LEVELS WERE ASSESSED USING THE STAI-I AND STAI-II ANXIETY INVENTORY. THEIR SATISFACTION LEVELS ABOUT THE YOGA PROGRAM WAS EVALUATED USING THE VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS). RESULTS: IT WAS FOUND THAT PATIENTS' QUALITY OF LIFE SCORES AFTER THE YOGA PROGRAM WERE BETTER THAN SCORES OBTAINED BEFORE THE YOGA PROGRAM (P < 0.05). AFTER SESSIONS, THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THEIR STAI-I (MEASURING THE REACTIONS OF ANXIETY) SCORES AND STAI-II (MEASURING THE PERMANENCE OF ANXIETY) SCORES (P < 0.05). IT WAS FOUND OUT THAT THE SATISFACTION SCORE CONCERNING THE YOGA PROGRAM WAS CONSIDERABLY INCREASED AFTER THE YOGA PROGRAM (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT YOGA IS VALUABLE IN HELPING TO ACHIEVE RELAXATION AND DIMINISH STRESS, HELPS CANCER PATIENTS PERFORM DAILY AND ROUTINE ACTIVITIES, AND INCREASES THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN CANCER PATIENTS. THIS RESULT WAS POSITIVELY REFLECTED IN PATIENTS SATISFACTION WITH THE YOGA PROGRAM.	2010

10  428  41 CAN YOGA HAVE ANY EFFECT ON SHOULDER AND ARM PAIN AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER? A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED, SINGLE-BLIND TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SHOULDER AND ARM PAIN, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), DEPRESSION, AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. METHODS: THIS PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED STUDY INCLUDED 42 PATIENTS. THE PATIENTS IN GROUP 1 UNDERWENT A 10-WEEK HATHA YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM. THE PATIENTS IN GROUP 2 WERE INCLUDED IN A 10-WEEK FOLLOW-UP PROGRAM. OUR PRIMARY ENDPOINT WAS ARM AND SHOULDER PAIN INTENSITY. RESULTS: THE GROUP RECEIVING YOGA SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR PAIN SEVERITY FROM BASELINE TO POST-TREATMENT, AND THESE BENEFITS WERE MAINTAINED AT 2.5 MONTHS POST-TREATMENT. WHEN COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP, THERE WERE NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 2 GROUPS WITH RESPECT TO THE PARAMETERS ASSESSED AT THE END OF WEEK 10. CONCLUSION: YOGA WAS AN EFFECTIVE AND SAFE EXERCISE FOR ALLEVIATING SHOULDER AND ARM PAIN, WHICH IS A COMPLICATION WITH A HIGH PREVALENCE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
11   60  40 A COMPARISON OF THE EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA AND RESISTANCE EXERCISE ON MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING IN SEDENTARY ADULTS: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVES: PHYSICAL ACTIVITY HAS A POSITIVE EFFECT ON PEOPLE'S MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA AND RESISTANCE EXERCISES ON MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING IN SEDENTARY ADULTS. DESIGN: RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. METHODS: FIFTY-ONE PARTICIPANTS AGED MEAN (SD) 25.6 (5.7) YEARS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO THREE GROUPS: HATHA YOGA GROUP, RESISTANCE EXERCISE GROUP AND CONTROL GROUP. THE HATHA YOGA GROUP AND RESISTANCE EXERCISE GROUP PARTICIPATED IN SESSIONS THREE DAYS PER WEEK FOR 7 WEEKS AND THE CONTROL GROUP DID NOT PARTICIPATE IN ANY SESSIONS. ALL THE SUBJECTS WERE EVALUATED THROUGH THE ROSENBERG SELF-ESTEEM SCALE, BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY, BODY CATHEXIS SCALE, NOTTINGHAM HEALTH PROFILE AND VISUAL ANALOG SCALE FOR FATIGUE PRE-AND POST-SESSION. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE FOUND IN TERMS OF ALL OUTCOME MEASURES IN THE HATHA YOGA GROUP AND THE RESISTANCE EXERCISE GROUP. NO IMPROVEMENTS WERE FOUND IN THE CONTROL GROUP. HATHA YOGA MORE IMPROVED THE DIMENSIONS FATIGUE, SELF-ESTEEM, AND QUALITY OF LIFE, WHILST RESISTANCE EXERCISE TRAINING MORE IMPROVED BODY IMAGE. HATHA YOGA AND RESISTANCE EXERCISE DECREASED DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AT A SIMILAR LEVEL. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT HATHA YOGA AND RESISTANCE EXERCISE HAD POSITIVE EFFECTS ON MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING IN SEDENTARY ADULTS.

PRIMARY FUNCTIONAL OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED THE FORWARD REACH (FR) AND SIT AND REACH (SR) TESTS. ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED OSWESTRY DISABILITY INDEX (ODI) AND BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY (BDI) QUESTIONNAIRES. GUIDING QUESTIONS WERE USED FOR QUALITATIVE DATA ANALYSIS TO ASCERTAIN HOW YOGA PARTICIPANTS PERCEIVED THE INSTRUCTOR, GROUP DYNAMICS, AND THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON THEIR LIFE. ANALYSIS: TO ACCOUNT FOR DROP OUTS, THE DATA WERE DIVIDED INTO BETTER OR NOT CATEGORIES, AND ANALYZED USING CHI-SQUARE TO EXAMINE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GROUPS. QUALITATIVE DATA WERE ANALYZED THROUGH FREQUENCY OF POSITIVE RESPONSES. RESULTS: POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT TRENDS IN THE FUNCTIONAL MEASUREMENT SCORES SHOWED IMPROVED BALANCE AND FLEXIBILITY AND DECREASED DISABILITY AND DEPRESSION FOR THE YOGA GROUP BUT THIS PILOT WAS NOT POWERED TO REACH STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS INCLUDED A HIGH DROPOUT RATE IN THE CONTROL GROUP AND LARGE BASELINE DIFFERENCES IN THE SECONDARY MEASURES. IN ADDITION, ANALYSIS OF THE QUALITATIVE DATA REVEALED THE FOLLOWING FREQUENCY OF RESPONSES (1) GROUP INTERVENTION MOTIVATED THE PARTICIPANTS AND (2) YOGA FOSTERED RELAXATION AND NEW AWARENESS/LEARNING. CONCLUSION: A MODIFIED YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION MAY BENEFIT INDIVIDUALS WITH CLB, BUT A LARGER STUDY IS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE DEFINITIVE EVIDENCE. ALSO, THE IMPACT ON DEPRESSION AND DISABILITY COULD BE CONSIDERED AS IMPORTANT OUTCOMES FOR FURTHER STUDY. ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONAL OUTCOME MEASURES SHOULD BE EXPLORED. THIS PILOT STUDY SUPPORTS THE NEED FOR MORE RESEARCH INVESTIGATING THE EFFECT OF YOGA FOR THIS POPULATION.	2004	

15 2096  54 THE EFFECT OF YOGA EXERCISE ON IMPROVING DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND FATIGUE IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND FATIGUE ARE AMONG THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS THAT INFLUENCE THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER WHO RECEIVE ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY. ALTHOUGH EVIDENCE HAS SHOWN YOGA TO DECREASE ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER, FEW STUDIES ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA HAVE TARGETED PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. YOGA INTERVENTIONS SHOULD BE TESTED TO PROMOTE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH OF WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER. PURPOSE: THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AN 8-WEEK YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM IN PROMOTING THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH OF WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER UNDERGOING ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY IN TERMS OF DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND FATIGUE. METHODS: A SAMPLE OF 60 WOMEN WITH NONMETASTATIC BREAST CANCER WAS RECRUITED. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED INTO EITHER THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (N = 30) OR THE CONTROL GROUP (N = 30). A 60-MINUTE, TWICE-PER-WEEK YOGA EXERCISE WAS IMPLEMENTED FOR 8 WEEKS AS THE INTERVENTION FOR THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP. THE CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED STANDARD CARE ONLY. RESULTS: ANALYSIS USING THE JOHNSON-NEYMAN PROCEDURE FOUND THAT THE YOGA EXERCISE REDUCED OVERALL FATIGUE AND THE INTERFERENCE OF FATIGUE IN EVERYDAY LIFE FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PARTICIPANTS. SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS WERE OBTAINED AFTER 4 WEEKS OF INTERVENTION PARTICIPATION FOR THOSE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PATIENTS WITH RELATIVELY LOW STARTING BASELINE VALUES (BASELINE ITEM MEAN VALUE < 3.31 AND 3.22, RESPECTIVELY) AND AFTER 8 WEEKS FOR MOST PATIENTS (APPROXIMATELY 75%) WITH MODERATE STARTING BASELINE VALUES (BASELINE ITEM MEAN VALUE < 7.30 AND 5.34, RESPECTIVELY). THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE LEVELS OF DEPRESSION (F = 1.29, P > .05) OR ANXIETY (F = 2.7, P > .05). CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: THE 8-WEEK YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM DEVELOPED IN THIS STUDY EFFECTIVELY REDUCED FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER BUT DID NOT REDUCE DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY. ONCOLOGY NURSES SHOULD STRENGTHEN THEIR CLINICAL HEALTH EDUCATION AND APPLY YOGA TO REDUCE THE FATIGUE EXPERIENCED BY PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER WHO UNDERGO ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY.	2014	
                           
16 2080  43 THE EFFECT OF GROUP MINDFULNESS - BASED STRESS REDUCTION PROGRAM AND CONSCIOUS YOGA ON THE FATIGUE SEVERITY AND GLOBAL AND SPECIFIC LIFE QUALITY IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER. BACKGROUND: CANCER IS NOT MERELY AN EVENT WITH A CERTAIN END, BUT IT IS A PERMANENT AND VAGUE SITUATION THAT IS DETERMINED BY DELAYED EFFECTS DUE TO THE DISEASE, ITS TREATMENT AND ITS RELATED PSYCHOLOGICAL ISSUES. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION PROGRAM AND CONSCIOUS YOGA ON THE MENTAL FATIGUE SEVERITY AND LIFE QUALITY OF WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER. METHODS: THIS WAS A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDY WITH A PRE-TEST, POST-TEST AND CONTROL GROUP. IN THIS STUDY, 24 PATIENTS WITH THE DIAGNOSIS OF BREAST CANCER WERE SELECTED AMONG THE PATIENTS WHO REFERRED TO THE DIVISION OF ONCOLOGY AND RADIOTHERAPY OF IMAM HOSSEIN HOSPITAL IN TEHRAN USING AVAILABLE SAMPLING METHOD, AND WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED INTO THE EXPERIMENTAL AND CONTROL GROUPS. ALL THE PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE FATIGUE SEVERITY SCALE, GLOBAL LIFE QUALITY OF CANCER PATIENT AND SPECIFIC LIFE QUALITY OF CANCER PATIENT QUESTIONNAIRES. DATA WERE ANALYZED BY MULTIVARIATE REPEATED MEASUREMENT VARIANCE ANALYSIS MODEL. RESULTS: FINDINGS REVEALED THAT THE MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION TREATMENT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED THE OVERALL QUALITY OF LIFE, ROLE, COGNITIVE, EMOTION, SOCIAL FUNCTIONS AND PAIN AND FATIGUE SYMPTOMS IN GLOBAL LIFE QUALITY IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP. IT ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED THE BODY IMAGE, FUTURE FUNCTIONS AND THERAPY SIDE EFFECTS IN SPECIFIC LIFE QUALITY OF THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. IN ADDITION, FATIGUE SEVERITY CAUSED BY CANCER WAS REDUCED SIGNIFICANTLY. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE MINDFULNESS - BASED STRESS REDUCTION TREATMENT CAN BE EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING GLOBAL AND SPECIFIC LIFE QUALITY AND FATIGUE SEVERITY IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
17  500  29 COMBINING GROUP PSYCHOTHERAPY AND YOGA EXERCISES IMPROVES QUALITY OF LIFE IN MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS: A CONTROLLED RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. PURPOSE: THIS STUDY AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF COMBINING 12-WEEK GROUP PSYCHOTHERAPY WITH YOGA EXERCISES ON STRESS PERCEPTION AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THIS STUDY WAS A PARALLEL-ARM RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, IN WHICH THE PARTICIPANTS WAS UNAWARE OF WHICH GROUP WAS THE EXPERIMENTAL ONE. PARTICIPANTS INVOLVED IN OUR RESEARCH WERE ASSIGNED TO TWO GROUPS OF SEPARATE TREATMENT THAT FOLLOWED FOR THREE MONTHS GROUP PSYCHOTHERAPY COMBINED WITH YOGA PROGRAM FOR STRESS MANAGEMENT OR USUAL STRESS COPING STRATEGIES. FINDINGS: THE FINDINGS DID NOT REVEAL A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN STRESS PERCEPTION ASSESSED IN THE TWO GROUPS EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER INTERVENTION BUT REVEAL A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE TWO GROUPS BEFORE AND AFTER THE PSYCHO BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THE FINDINGS DID NOT REVEAL A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN STRESS PERCEPTION ASSESSED IN THE TWO GROUPS EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER INTERVENTION BUT REVEAL A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN THE TWO GROUPS BEFORE AND AFTER THE PSYCHO BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
18 2508  52 YOGA BREATHING FOR CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY-ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE: RESULTS OF A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: MANY DEBILITATING SYMPTOMS ARISE FROM CANCER AND ITS TREATMENT THAT ARE OFTEN UNRELIEVED BY ESTABLISHED METHODS. PRANAYAMA, A SERIES OF YOGIC BREATHING TECHNIQUES, MAY IMPROVE CANCER-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE, BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED FOR THIS PURPOSE. OBJECTIVES: A PILOT STUDY WAS PERFORMED TO EVALUATE FEASIBILITY AND TO TEST THE EFFECTS OF PRANAYAMA ON CANCER-ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE. DESIGN: THIS WAS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL COMPARING PRANAYAMA TO USUAL CARE. SETTING: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT A UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER. SUBJECTS: PATIENTS RECEIVING CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE PRANAYAMA IMMEDIATELY OR AFTER A WAITING PERIOD (CONTROL GROUP). INTERVENTIONS: THE PRANAYAMA INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF FOUR BREATHING TECHNIQUES TAUGHT IN WEEKLY CLASSES AND PRACTICED AT HOME. THE TREATMENT GROUP RECEIVED PRANAYAMA DURING TWO CONSECUTIVE CYCLES OF CHEMOTHERAPY. THE CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED USUAL CARE DURING THEIR FIRST CYCLE, AND RECEIVED PRANAYAMA DURING THEIR SECOND CYCLE OF CHEMOTHERAPY. OUTCOME MEASURES: FEASIBILITY, CANCER-ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS (FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, STRESS), AND QUALITY OF LIFE WERE THE OUTCOMES. RESULTS: CLASS ATTENDANCE WAS NEARLY 100% IN BOTH GROUPS. SIXTEEN (16) PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL INTENT-TO-TREAT ANALYSES. THE REPEATED-MEASURES ANALYSES DEMONSTRATED THAT ANY INCREASE IN PRANAYAMA DOSE, WITH DOSE MEASURED IN THE NUMBER OF HOURS PRACTICED IN CLASS OR AT HOME, RESULTED IN IMPROVED SYMPTOM AND QUALITY-OF-LIFE SCORES. SEVERAL OF THESE ASSOCIATIONS--SLEEP DISTURBANCE (P=0.04), ANXIETY (P=0.04), AND MENTAL QUALITY OF LIFE (P=0.05)--REACHED OR APPROACHED STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA BREATHING WAS A FEASIBLE INTERVENTION AMONG PATIENTS WITH CANCER RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY. PRANAYAMA MAY IMPROVE SLEEP DISTURBANCE, ANXIETY, AND MENTAL QUALITY OF LIFE. A DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP WAS FOUND BETWEEN PRANAYAMA USE AND IMPROVEMENTS IN CHEMOTHERAPY-ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE. THESE FINDINGS NEED TO BE CONFIRMED IN A LARGER STUDY.	2012	
                                                                                            
19  723  41 EFFECT OF LAUGHTER YOGA ON MENTAL SYMPTOMS AND SALIVARY CORTISOL LEVELS IN FIRST-YEAR NURSING STUDENTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: UNIVERSITY STUDENTS ARE FACED WITH SEVERAL STRESS FACTORS AFFECTING THEIR MENTAL HEALTH. THEREFORE, THE FIRST YEAR AT UNIVERSITY IS A PERIOD THAT CALLS FOR CAREFUL ATTENTION AND RESEARCH. AIM: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF LAUGHTER YOGA ON MENTAL SYMPTOMS AND CORTISOL LEVELS IN NURSING STUDENTS. METHODS: THIS STUDY IS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY EMPLOYING A PRE-/POST-TEST DESIGN WITH A CONTROL GROUP. A TOTAL OF 75 HEALTHY UNIVERSITY STUDENTS WERE ASSIGNED TO THE INTERVENTION GROUP AND CONTROL GROUP. THE BRIEF SYMPTOM INVENTORY WAS APPLIED TO BOTH GROUPS BEFORE SESSION 1 AND AFTER SESSION 8. SALIVA SAMPLES WERE TAKEN FROM THE STUDENTS TO MEASURE THEIR CORTISOL LEVELS BEFORE AND AFTER EACH SESSION. RESULTS: EVALUATION OF THE MEAN SCORES OBTAINED FROM THE BRIEF SYMPTOM INVENTORY BEFORE AND AFTER THE INTERVENTION SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE SCORES BETWEEN GROUPS (P < 0.05). IN THREE OUT OF THE EIGHT SESSIONS, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL GROUP REGARDING THE MEAN VALUES OF PRE-TEST AND POST-TEST SALIVARY CORTISOL LEVELS (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: LAUGHTER YOGA CAN PROVIDE AN EFFECTIVE MEANS TO HELP FIRST-YEAR NURSING STUDENTS COPE WITH STRESS AND REDUCE MENTAL SYMPTOMS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
20 2189  47 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND DEPRESSION IN ELDERLY BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER. DESIGN: TWENTY PATIENTS (10 WERE IN YOGA PROGRAM, 10 WERE IN EXERCISE GROUP) BETWEEN 65 AND 70 YEARS OF AGE UNDER GOING TREATMENT FOR CANCER WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PATIENTS WERE RECORDED AND GENERAL PHYSIOTHERAPY ASSESSMENTS PERFORMED. EIGHT SESSIONS OF A CLASSICAL YOGA PROGRAM INCLUDING WARMING AND BREATHING EXERCISES, ASANAS, RELAXATION IN SUPINE POSITION, AND MEDITATION AND 8 SESSIONS OF CLASSICAL EXERCISE PROGRAM WERE APPLIED TO PARTICIPANTS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA AND EXERCISE PROGRAM, QUALITY OF LIFE ASSESSMENTS FOR THE PATIENTS WERE CONDUCTED USING THE NOTTINGHAM HEALTH PROFILE (NHP). PATIENTS' DEPRESSION LEVELS WERE ASSESSED USING THE BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY. THEIR LEVEL OF PAIN, FATIGUE AND SLEEP QUALITY WAS EVALUATED USING THE VISUAL ANALOG SCALE (VAS). RESULTS: IT WAS FOUND THAT ALL PATIENTS' QUALITY OF LIFE SCORES AFTER THE YOGA AND EXERCISE PROGRAM WERE BETTER THAN SCORES OBTAINED BEFORE THE YOGA AND EXERCISE PROGRAM (P < 0.05). WHEN THE POST TREATMENT DATA OF THE GROUPS WERE COMPARED IN TERMS OF NHP AND SUBCATEGORIES, ER, SI, S, PA AND THE TOTAL SCORES OF NHP WERE FOUND SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT IN FAVOR OF GROUP I (P < 0.05). HOWEVER EL AND P SCORES OF THE NHP WERE NOT DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE GROUPS (P > 0.05). WHEN THE GROUPS WERE COMPARED IN TERMS OF DEPRESSION, PAIN, FATIGUE, AND SLEEP QUALITY, STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND IN ALL PARAMETERS BETWEEN PRE AND POST TREATMENT VALUES FOR BOTH GROUPS (P < 0.05). WHEN THE POST-TREATMENT VALUES OF THE GROUPS WERE COMPARED, FATIGUE AND SLEEP QUALITY WERE FOUND STATISTICALLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE GROUPS IN FAVOR OF GROUP I (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT YOGA IS VALUABLE IN HELPING TO DIMINISH DEPRESSION, PAIN, FATIGUE AND HELPS CANCER PATIENTS TO PERFORM DAILY AND ROUTINE ACTIVITIES, AND INCREASES THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER.	2015

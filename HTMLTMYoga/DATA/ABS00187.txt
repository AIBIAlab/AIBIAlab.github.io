1  187 150 A RANDOMIZED PREFERENCE TRIAL COMPARING COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY AND YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF LATE-LIFE WORRY: EXAMINATION OF IMPACT ON DEPRESSION, GENERALIZED ANXIETY, FATIGUE, PAIN, SOCIAL PARTICIPATION, AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION. BACKGROUND: DEPRESSION, GENERALIZED ANXIETY, FATIGUE, DIMINISHED PHYSICAL FUNCTION, REDUCED SOCIAL PARTICIPATION, AND PAIN ARE COMMON FOR MANY OLDER ADULTS AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT QUALITY OF LIFE. THE PURPOSE OF THE OVERALL TRIAL WAS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT) AND YOGA ON LATE-LIFE WORRY, ANXIETY, AND SLEEP; AND EXAMINE PREFERENCE AND SELECTION EFFECTS ON THESE OUTCOMES. OBJECTIVE: THE PRESENT ANALYSES COMPARED EFFECTS OF THE 2 INTERVENTIONS ON ADDITIONAL OUTCOMES (DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, GENERALIZED ANXIETY SYMPTOMS, FATIGUE, PAIN INTERFERENCE/INTENSITY, PHYSICAL FUNCTION, SOCIAL PARTICIPATION); AND EXAMINED WHETHER THERE ARE PREFERENCE AND SELECTION EFFECTS FOR THESE TREATMENTS. METHODS: A RANDOMIZED PREFERENCE TRIAL OF CBT AND YOGA WAS CONDUCTED IN ADULTS >/=60 YEARS WHO SCORED >/=26 ON THE PENN STATE WORRY QUESTIONNAIRE-ABBREVIATED (PSWQ-A), RECRUITED FROM OUTPATIENT MEDICAL CLINICS, MAILINGS, AND ADVERTISEMENTS. COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY CONSISTED OF 10 WEEKLY TELEPHONE SESSIONS. YOGA CONSISTED OF 20 BI-WEEKLY GROUP YOGA CLASSES. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO(1): A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) OF CBT OR YOGA (N = 250); OR (2) A PREFERENCE TRIAL IN WHICH THEY SELECTED THEIR TREATMENT (CBT OR YOGA; N = 250). OUTCOMES WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION. RESULTS: WITHIN THE RCT, THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCES FOR BOTH PAIN INTERFERENCE AND INTENSITY. THE PAIN INTERFERENCE SCORE IMPROVED MORE FOR THE CBT GROUP COMPARED WITH THE YOGA GROUP [INTERVENTION EFFECT OF (MEAN (95% CI) = 2.5 (.5, 4.6), P = .02]. FOR THE PAIN INTENSITY SCORE, THE INTERVENTION EFFECT ALSO FAVORED CBT OVER YOGA [.7 (.2, 1.3), P < .01]. DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, GENERALIZED ANXIETY, AND FATIGUE SHOWED CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL WITHIN-GROUP CHANGES IN BOTH GROUPS. THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN OR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PHYSICAL FUNCTION OR SOCIAL PARTICIPATION FOR EITHER GROUP. NO PREFERENCE OR SELECTION EFFECTS WERE FOUND. CONCLUSION: BOTH CBT AND YOGA MAY BE USEFUL FOR OLDER ADULTS FOR IMPROVING PSYCHOLOGICAL SYMPTOMS AND FATIGUE. COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY MAY OFFER EVEN GREATER BENEFIT THAN YOGA FOR DECREASING PAIN.	2022	
                                                                                                                       
2 1557  73 LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY AND YOGA FOR WORRIED OLDER ADULTS. OBJECTIVES: COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT) AND YOGA DECREASE WORRY AND ANXIETY. THERE ARE NO LONG-TERM DATA COMPARING CBT AND YOGA FOR WORRY, ANXIETY, AND SLEEP IN OLDER ADULTS. THE IMPACT OF PREFERENCE AND SELECTION ON THESE OUTCOMES IS UNKNOWN. IN THIS SECONDARY DATA ANALYSIS, WE COMPARED LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF CBT BY TELEPHONE AND YOGA ON WORRY, ANXIETY, SLEEP, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, FATIGUE, PHYSICAL FUNCTION, SOCIAL PARTICIPATION, AND PAIN; AND EXAMINED PREFERENCE AND SELECTION EFFECTS. DESIGN: IN THIS RANDOMIZED PREFERENCE TRIAL, PARTICIPANTS (N = 500) WERE RANDOMIZED TO A: 1) RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) OF CBT OR YOGA (N = 250); OR 2) PREFERENCE TRIAL (SELECTED CBT OR YOGA; N = 250). OUTCOMES WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE AND WEEK 37. SETTING: COMMUNITY. PARTICIPANTS: COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS (AGE 60+ YEARS). INTERVENTIONS: CBT (BY TELEPHONE) AND YOGA (IN-PERSON GROUP CLASSES). MEASUREMENTS: PENN STATE WORRY QUESTIONNAIRE - ABBREVIATED (WORRY);(1)(,)(2) INSOMNIA SEVERITY INDEX (SLEEP);(3) PROMIS ANXIETY SHORT FORM V1.0 (ANXIETY);(4)(,)(5) GENERALIZED ANXIETY DISORDER SCREENER (GENERALIZED ANXIETY);(6)(,)(7) AND PROMIS-29 (DEPRESSION, FATIGUE, PHYSICAL FUNCTION, SOCIAL PARTICIPATION, PAIN).(8)(,)(9) RESULTS: SIX MONTHS AFTER INTERVENTION COMPLETION, CBT AND YOGA RCT PARTICIPANTS REPORTED SUSTAINED IMPROVEMENTS FROM BASELINE IN WORRY, ANXIETY, SLEEP, DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, FATIGUE, AND SOCIAL PARTICIPATION (NO SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCES). USING DATA COMBINED FROM THE RANDOMIZED AND PREFERENCE TRIALS, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT PREFERENCE OR SELECTION EFFECTS. LONG-TERM INTERVENTION EFFECTS WERE OBSERVED AT CLINICALLY MEANINGFUL LEVELS FOR MOST OF THE STUDY OUTCOMES. CONCLUSIONS: CBT AND YOGA BOTH DEMONSTRATED MAINTAINED IMPROVEMENTS FROM BASELINE ON MULTIPLE OUTCOMES SIX MONTHS AFTER INTERVENTION COMPLETION IN A LARGE SAMPLE OF OLDER ADULTS.

3  524  79 COMPARISON OF COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY AND YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF LATE-LIFE WORRY: A RANDOMIZED PREFERENCE TRIAL. BACKGROUND: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT) AND YOGA ON LATE-LIFE WORRY, ANXIETY, AND SLEEP; AND EXAMINE PREFERENCE AND SELECTION EFFECTS ON THESE OUTCOMES. METHODS: A RANDOMIZED PREFERENCE TRIAL OF CBT AND YOGA WAS CONDUCTED IN COMMUNITY-DWELLING ADULTS 60 YEARS OR OLDER, WHO SCORED 26 OR ABOVE ON THE PENN STATE WORRY QUESTIONNAIRE-ABBREVIATED (PSWQ-A). CBT CONSISTED OF 10 WEEKLY TELEPHONE SESSIONS. YOGA CONSISTED OF 20 BIWEEKLY GROUP YOGA CLASSES. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS WORRY (PSWQ-A); THE SECONDARY OUTCOMES WERE ANXIETY (PROMIS-ANXIETY) AND SLEEP (INSOMNIA SEVERITY INDEX [ISI]). WE EXAMINED BOTH PREFERENCE EFFECTS (AVERAGE EFFECT FOR THOSE WHO RECEIVED THEIR PREFERRED INTERVENTION [REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT WAS CBT OR YOGA] MINUS THE AVERAGE FOR THOSE WHO DID NOT RECEIVE THEIR PREFERRED INTERVENTION [REGARDLESS OF THE INTERVENTION]) AND SELECTION EFFECT (WHICH ADDRESSES THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THERE IS A BENEFIT TO GETTING TO SELECT ONE INTERVENTION OVER THE OTHER, AND MEASURES THE EFFECT ON OUTCOMES OF SELF-SELECTION TO A SPECIFIC INTERVENTION). RESULTS: FIVE HUNDRED OLDER ADULTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO THE RANDOMIZED TRIAL (125 EACH IN CBT AND YOGA) OR THE PREFERENCE TRIAL (120 CHOSE CBT; 130 CHOSE YOGA). IN THE RANDOMIZED TRIAL, THE INTERVENTION EFFECT OF YOGA COMPARED WITH CBT ADJUSTED FOR BASELINE PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATION USE, GENDER, AND RACE WAS 1.6 (-0.2, 3.3), P = .08 FOR THE PSWQ-A. SIMILAR RESULTS WERE OBSERVED WITH PROMIS-ANXIETY (ADJUSTED INTERVENTION EFFECT: 0.3 [-1.5, 2.2], P = .71). PARTICIPANTS RANDOMIZED TO CBT EXPERIENCED A GREATER REDUCTION IN THE ISI COMPARED WITH YOGA (ADJUSTED INTERVENTION EFFECT: 2.4 [1.2, 3.7], P < .01]). ESTIMATED IN THE COMBINED DATA SET (N = 500), THE PREFERENCE AND SELECTION EFFECTS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR THE PSWQ-A, PROMIS-ANXIETY, AND ISI. OF THE 52 ADVERSE EVENTS, ONLY TWO WERE POSSIBLY RELATED TO THE INTERVENTION. NONE OF THE 26 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS WERE RELATED TO THE STUDY INTERVENTIONS. CONCLUSIONS: CBT AND YOGA WERE BOTH EFFECTIVE AT REDUCING LATE-LIFE WORRY AND ANXIETY. HOWEVER, A GREATER IMPACT WAS SEEN FOR CBT COMPARED WITH YOGA FOR IMPROVING SLEEP. NEITHER PREFERENCE NOR SELECTION EFFECTS WAS FOUND.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                              
4  133  50 A PRAGMATIC PREFERENCE TRIAL OF THERAPEUTIC YOGA AS AN ADJUNCT TO GROUP COGNITIVE BEHAVIOUR THERAPY VERSUS GROUP CBT ALONE FOR DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY. BACKGROUND: YOGA HAS SEVERAL MECHANISMS THAT MAKE IT A PROMISING TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, INCLUDING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, BEHAVIOURAL ACTIVATION, AND MINDFULNESS. FOLLOWING POSITIVE OUTCOMES FROM ADAPTED CBT INTERVENTIONS INCORPORATING MINDFULNESS-BASED PRACTICES, THIS STUDY EXPLORED THE EFFECTS OF A THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM AS AN ADJUNCT TO GROUP-BASED CBT FOR DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY. METHODS: THIS WAS A PRAGMATIC PREFERENCE TRIAL INVOLVING ADULTS DIAGNOSED WITH DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY IN A REGIONAL PRIMARY MENTAL HEALTHCARE SERVICE (N = 59), COMPARING TRANSDIAGNOSTIC GROUP CBT (N = 27) WITH TRANSDIAGNOSTIC GROUP CBT COMBINED WITH AN ADJUNCT THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM (N = 32). A PREFERENCE RECRUITMENT DESIGN ALLOWED ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS (N = 35) TO SELF-SELECT INTO THE ADJUNCT PROGRAM. THE DEPRESSION ANXIETY STRESS SCALE-21 (DASS) WAS ASSESSED AT BASELINE, POST-INTERVENTION, AND THREE-MONTHS FOLLOW UP. RESULTS: CBT + YOGA WAS AN ACCEPTABLE ALTERNATIVE TO CBT ALONE. SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS WERE OBSERVED IN TOTAL DASS SCORES AND THE 3 SUBSCALES OF THE DASS FOR BOTH GROUPS, HOWEVER CBT + YOGA SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER DEPRESSIVE AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS POST-INTERVENTION, COMPARED TO CBT ALONE. CBT + YOGA ALSO SHOWED SUSTAINED REDUCTIONS IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS OVER THREE-MONTHS, AND MORE RAPID REDUCTIONS IN DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS, COMPARED TO CBT ALONE. LIMITATIONS: THESE FINDINGS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED PRELIMINARY DUE TO THE MODERATE SAMPLE SIZE, WITH A RIGOROUS RANDOMISED CONTROL TRIAL NECESSARY TO DEFINITIVELY SUPPORT THE INTEGRATION OF YOGA WITHIN MENTAL HEALTH CARE TO AUGMENT THE BENEFITS AND UPTAKE OF TRANSDIAGNOSTIC CBT FOR DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY. CONCLUSIONS: COMPLEMENTING OTHER MINDFULNESS-BASED PRACTICES, THERAPEUTIC YOGA SHOWS PROMISE AS AN ADJUNCT TO TRANSDIAGNOSTIC CBT.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
5  345  40 ASSESSING FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY OF YOGA AND GROUP CBT FOR ADOLESCENTS WITH DEPRESSION: A PILOT RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. PURPOSE: GIVEN INCREASING RATES OF DEPRESSION IN ADOLESCENTS, THERE IS A CLEAR NEED FOR INNOVATIVE TREATMENTS. IN THIS PILOT RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL, WE ASSESSED ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY OF TWO GROUP-BASED INTERVENTIONS: YOGA AND COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT). THE GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO PREPARE FOR A FUTURE FULLY POWERED RANDOMIZED TRIAL TO TEST THE HYPOTHESIS THAT YOGA IS NOT INFERIOR TO AN ESTABLISHED ADOLESCENT DEPRESSION TREATMENT, NAMELY, GROUP CBT. METHODS: WE ENROLLED 42 ADOLESCENTS WITH ELEVATED DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A 12-WEEK GROUP-BASED INTERVENTION, YOGA OR CBT. WE HAD A PRIORI FEASIBILITY AND ACCEPTABILITY TARGETS, INCLUDING FOR RECRUITMENT RATE, RETENTION RATE, EXPECTANCY, CREDIBILITY, PROGRAM SATISFACTION, CLASS ATTENDANCE, ENGAGEMENT IN HOME PRACTICE, AND INSTRUCTOR/LEADER MANUAL ADHERENCE. WE ASSESSED ADVERSE EVENTS, AND WITHIN-SUBJECT CHANGES IN OUTCOMES (DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, IMPAIRMENT, SLEEP DISTURBANCE) AND POSSIBLE MEDIATORS (MINDFULNESS, SELF-COMPASSION). RESULTS: BOTH INTERVENTIONS MET MOST ACCEPTABILITY AND FEASIBILITY TARGETS. THE ONLY TARGET NOT MET RELATED TO LOW ENGAGEMENT IN HOME PRACTICE. PARTICIPANTS WITHIN EACH STUDY ARM SHOWED DECREASED DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS OVER TIME AND INCREASED SELF-COMPASSION. CONCLUSIONS: A YOGA INTERVENTION APPEARS TO BE ACCEPTABLE AND FEASIBLE TO ADOLESCENTS WITH DEPRESSION. HOWEVER, IT MAY BE CHALLENGING FOR THIS GROUP TO ENGAGE IN UNSTRUCTURED HOME PRACTICE.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
6  428  47 CAN YOGA HAVE ANY EFFECT ON SHOULDER AND ARM PAIN AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER? A RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED, SINGLE-BLIND TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SHOULDER AND ARM PAIN, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), DEPRESSION, AND PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. METHODS: THIS PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED STUDY INCLUDED 42 PATIENTS. THE PATIENTS IN GROUP 1 UNDERWENT A 10-WEEK HATHA YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM. THE PATIENTS IN GROUP 2 WERE INCLUDED IN A 10-WEEK FOLLOW-UP PROGRAM. OUR PRIMARY ENDPOINT WAS ARM AND SHOULDER PAIN INTENSITY. RESULTS: THE GROUP RECEIVING YOGA SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR PAIN SEVERITY FROM BASELINE TO POST-TREATMENT, AND THESE BENEFITS WERE MAINTAINED AT 2.5 MONTHS POST-TREATMENT. WHEN COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP, THERE WERE NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 2 GROUPS WITH RESPECT TO THE PARAMETERS ASSESSED AT THE END OF WEEK 10. CONCLUSION: YOGA WAS AN EFFECTIVE AND SAFE EXERCISE FOR ALLEVIATING SHOULDER AND ARM PAIN, WHICH IS A COMPLICATION WITH A HIGH PREVALENCE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
7 2320  45 TREATMENT CREDIBILITY, EXPECTANCY, AND PREFERENCE: PREDICTION OF TREATMENT ENGAGEMENT AND OUTCOME IN A RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL OF HATHA YOGA VS. HEALTH EDUCATION AS ADJUNCT TREATMENTS FOR DEPRESSION. BACKGROUND: HATHA YOGA MAY BE HELPFUL FOR ALLEVIATING DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ANALYSIS IS TO DETERMINE WHETHER TREATMENT PROGRAM PREFERENCE, CREDIBILITY, OR EXPECTANCY PREDICT ENGAGEMENT IN DEPRESSION INTERVENTIONS (YOGA OR A CONTROL CLASS) OR DEPRESSION SYMPTOM SEVERITY OVER TIME. METHODS: THIS IS A SECONDARY ANALYSIS OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (RCT) OF HATHA YOGA VS. A HEALTH EDUCATION CONTROL GROUP FOR TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION. DEPRESSED PARTICIPANTS (N=122) ATTENDED UP TO 20 CLASSES OVER A PERIOD OF 10 WEEKS, AND THEN COMPLETED ADDITIONAL ASSESSMENTS AFTER 3 AND 6 MONTHS. WE ASSESSED TREATMENT PREFERENCE PRIOR TO RANDOMIZATION, AND TREATMENT CREDIBILITY AND EXPECTANCY AFTER PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED THEIR FIRST CLASS. TREATMENT "CONCORDANCE" INDICATED THAT TREATMENT PREFERENCE MATCHED ASSIGNED TREATMENT. RESULTS: TREATMENT CREDIBILITY, EXPECTANCY, AND CONCORDANCE WERE NOT ASSOCIATED WITH TREATMENT ENGAGEMENT. TREATMENT EXPECTANCY MODERATED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN TREATMENT GROUP AND DEPRESSION. DEPRESSION SEVERITY OVER TIME DIFFERED BY EXPECTANCY LEVEL FOR THE YOGA GROUP BUT NOT FOR THE HEALTH EDUCATION GROUP. CONTROLLING FOR BASELINE DEPRESSION, PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP WITH AN AVERAGE OR HIGH EXPECTANCY FOR IMPROVEMENT SHOWED LOWER DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS ACROSS THE ACUTE INTERVENTION AND FOLLOW-UP PERIOD THAN THOSE WITH A LOW EXPECTANCY FOR IMPROVEMENT. THERE WAS A TREND FOR A SIMILAR PATTERN FOR CREDIBILITY. CONCORDANCE WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH TREATMENT OUTCOME. LIMITATIONS: THIS IS A SECONDARY, POST-HOC ANALYSIS AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED HYPOTHESIS-GENERATING. CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS SUGGEST THAT EXPECTANCY IMPROVES THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS ONLY FOR A INTERVENTION THOUGHT TO ACTIVELY TARGET DEPRESSION (YOGA) AND NOT A CONTROL INTERVENTION.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
8 2811  51 YOGA TO PREVENT MOBILITY LIMITATIONS IN OLDER ADULTS: FEASIBILITY OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: THE LOSS OF MOBILITY DURING AGING IMPACTS INDEPENDENCE AND LEADS TO FURTHER DISABILITY, MORBIDITY, AND REDUCED LIFE EXPECTANCY. OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO EXAMINE THE FEASIBILITY AND SAFETY OF CONDUCTING A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF YOGA FOR OLDER ADULTS AT RISK FOR MOBILITY LIMITATIONS. METHODS: SEDENTARY OLDER ADULTS (N = 46; AGE 60-89) WERE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED TO EITHER YOGA OR A HEALTH EDUCATION COMPARISON GROUP. YOGA SESSIONS (60-MIN) OCCURRED 2X WEEKLY, AND 90-MIN HEALTH EDUCATION SESSIONS OCCURRED WEEKLY, FOR 10 WEEKS. THE PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE RECRUITMENT RATE, INTERVENTION ATTENDANCE, AND RETENTION AT ASSESSMENTS. ADVERSE EVENT RATES AND PARTICIPANT SATISFACTION WERE ALSO MEASURED. PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES OF GAIT, BALANCE, AND STRENGTH AND SELF-REPORT OUTCOME MEASURES WERE ADMINISTERED AT BASELINE AND 10-WEEKS. RESULTS: RECRUITMENT LASTED 6 MONTHS. RETENTION OF PARTICIPANTS AT THE 10-WEEK FOLLOW-UP WAS HIGH (89% - PERFORMANCE MEASURES; 98% - SELF-REPORT QUESTIONNAIRES). ATTENDANCE WAS GOOD WITH 82% OF YOGA AND 74% OF HEALTH EDUCATION PARTICIPANTS ATTENDING AT LEAST 50% OF THE SESSIONS. NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED. PATIENT SATISFACTION WITH THE INTERVENTIONS WAS HIGH. THE MEAN EFFECT SIZE FOR THE PHYSICAL PERFORMANCE MEASURES WAS 0.35 WITH SOME OVER 0.50. THE MEAN EFFECT SIZE FOR SELF-REPORT OUTCOME MEASURES WAS 0.36. CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS INDICATE THAT IT IS FEASIBLE TO CONDUCT A LARGER RCT OF YOGA FOR SEDENTARY OLDER ADULTS AT RISK FOR MOBILITY PROBLEMS. THE YOGA AND COMPARISON INTERVENTIONS WERE SAFE, WELL ACCEPTED, AND WELL ATTENDED. EFFECT SIZES SUGGEST YOGA MAY HAVE IMPORTANT BENEFITS FOR THIS POPULATION AND SHOULD BE STUDIED FURTHER.

9 1242  54 FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA INTERVENTION TO DECREASE PAIN IN OLDER WOMEN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF OLDER WOMEN SUFFER FROM CHRONIC PAIN, WHICH CAN DECREASE QUALITY OF LIFE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PILOT RANDOMIZED STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY OF A FLOW-RESTORATIVE YOGA INTERVENTION DESIGNED TO DECREASE PAIN AND RELATED OUTCOMES AMONG WOMEN AGED 60 OR OLDER. METHODS: FLOW-RESTORATIVE YOGA CLASSES WERE HELD TWICE WEEKLY FOR 1 HOUR AND LED BY A CERTIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTOR. PARTICIPANTS RANDOMIZED TO THE INTERVENTION GROUP ATTENDED THE YOGA CLASSES FOR 12 WEEKS AND RECEIVED SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS FOR AT-HOME PRACTICE. THOSE RANDOMIZED TO THE CONTROL GROUP WERE ASKED TO MAINTAIN THEIR NORMAL DAILY ROUTINE. FEASIBILITY WAS EVALUATED USING RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION RATES, CLASS AND HOME PRACTICE ADHERENCE RATES, AND PARTICIPANT SATISFACTION SURVEYS. OUTCOME MEASURES (SELF-REPORTED PAIN, INFLAMMATORY MARKERS, FUNCTIONAL FITNESS, QUALITY OF LIFE, RESILIENCE, AND SELF-REPORTED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY) WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION. PAIRED T-TESTS OR WILCOXON SIGNED-RANK TESTS WERE USED TO EXAMINE CHANGES IN OUTCOME MEASURES WITHIN TREATMENT GROUPS. RESULTS: THIRTY-EIGHT PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED AND RANDOMIZED. PARTICIPANTS WERE PRIMARILY WHITE, COLLEGE-EDUCATED, AND HIGHER FUNCTIONING, DESPITE EXPERIENCING VARIOUS FORMS OF CHRONIC PAIN. ATTENDANCE AND RETENTION RATES WERE HIGH (91 AND 97%, RESPECTIVELY) AND THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS WERE SATISFIED WITH THE YOGA PROGRAM (89%) AND WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS (87%). INTERVENTION PARTICIPANTS ALSO EXPERIENCED REDUCTIONS IN PAIN INTERFERENCE AND IMPROVEMENTS IN ENERGY AND SOCIAL FUNCTIONING. CONCLUSIONS: THIS PILOT STUDY PROVIDES ESSENTIAL DATA TO INFORM A FULL SCALE RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF FLOW-RESTORATIVE YOGA FOR OLDER WOMEN WITH CHRONIC PAIN. FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD EMPHASIZE STRATEGIES TO RECRUIT A MORE DIVERSE STUDY POPULATION, PARTICULARLY OLDER WOMEN AT HIGHER RISK OF DISABILITY AND FUNCTIONAL DECLINE.

10 1180  52 EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICACY OF IYENGAR YOGA THERAPY ON CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. STUDY DESIGN: THE EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICACY OF IYENGAR YOGA FOR CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) WERE ASSESSED WITH INTENTION-TO-TREAT AND PER-PROTOCOL ANALYSIS. NINETY SUBJECTS WERE RANDOMIZED TO A YOGA (N = 43) OR CONTROL GROUP (N = 47) RECEIVING STANDARD MEDICAL CARE. PARTICIPANTS WERE FOLLOWED 6 MONTHS AFTER COMPLETION OF THE INTERVENTION. OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE IYENGAR YOGA THERAPY ON CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. YOGA SUBJECTS WERE HYPOTHESIZED TO REPORT GREATER REDUCTIONS IN FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY, PAIN INTENSITY, DEPRESSION, AND PAIN MEDICATION USAGE THAN CONTROLS. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: CLBP IS A MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDER WITH PUBLIC HEALTH AND ECONOMIC IMPACT. PILOT STUDIES OF YOGA AND BACK PAIN HAVE REPORTED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN CLINICALLY IMPORTANT OUTCOMES. METHODS: SUBJECTS WERE RECRUITED THROUGH SELF-REFERRAL AND HEALTH PROFESSIONAL REFERRALS ACCORDING TO EXPLICIT INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA. YOGA SUBJECTS PARTICIPATED IN 24 WEEKS OF BIWEEKLY YOGA CLASSES DESIGNED FOR CLBP. OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED AT 12 (MIDWAY), 24 (IMMEDIATELY AFTER), AND 48 WEEKS (6-MONTH FOLLOW-UP) AFTER THE START OF THE INTERVENTION USING THE OSWESTRY DISABILITY QUESTIONNAIRE, A VISUAL ANALOG SCALE, THE BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY, AND A PAIN MEDICATION-USAGE QUESTIONNAIRE. RESULTS: USING INTENTION-TO-TREAT ANALYSIS WITH REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA (GROUP X TIME), SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER REDUCTIONS IN FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY AND PAIN INTENSITY WERE OBSERVED IN THE YOGA GROUP WHEN COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP AT 24 WEEKS. A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER PROPORTION OF YOGA SUBJECTS ALSO REPORTED CLINICAL IMPROVEMENTS AT BOTH 12 AND 24 WEEKS. IN ADDITION, DEPRESSION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN YOGA SUBJECTS. FURTHERMORE, WHILE A REDUCTION IN PAIN MEDICATION OCCURRED, THIS WAS COMPARABLE IN BOTH GROUPS. WHEN RESULTS WERE ANALYZED USING PER-PROTOCOL ANALYSIS, IMPROVEMENTS WERE OBSERVED FOR ALL OUTCOMES IN THE YOGA GROUP, INCLUDING AGREATER TREND FOR REDUCED PAIN MEDICATION USAGE. ALTHOUGH SLIGHTLY LESS THAN AT 24 WEEKS, THE YOGA GROUP HAD STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY, PAIN INTENSITY, AND DEPRESSION COMPARED TO STANDARD MEDICAL CARE 6-MONTHS POSTINTERVENTION. CONCLUSION: YOGA IMPROVES FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY, PAIN INTENSITY, AND DEPRESSION IN ADULTS WITH CLBP. THERE WAS ALSO A CLINICALLY IMPORTANT TREND FOR THE YOGA GROUP TO REDUCE THEIR PAIN MEDICATION USAGE COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP.	2009	

11  159  52 A RANDOMISED COMPARATIVE TRIAL OF YOGA AND RELAXATION TO REDUCE STRESS AND ANXIETY. OBJECTIVE: TO COMPARE YOGA AND RELAXATION AS TREATMENT MODALITIES AT 10 AND 16 WEEKS FROM STUDY BASELINE TO DETERMINE IF EITHER OF MODALITY REDUCES SUBJECT STRESS, ANXIETY, BLOOD PRESSURE AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF LIFE. DESIGN: A RANDOMISED COMPARATIVE TRIAL WAS UNDERTAKEN COMPARING YOGA WITH RELAXATION. PARTICIPANTS: ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-ONE SUBJECTS WITH MILD TO MODERATE LEVELS OF STRESS WERE RECRUITED FROM THE COMMUNITY IN SOUTH AUSTRALIA. INTERVENTIONS: TEN WEEKLY 1- H SESSIONS OF RELAXATION OR HATHA YOGA. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CHANGES IN THE STATE TRAIT PERSONALITY INVENTORY SUB-SCALE ANXIETY, GENERAL HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE AND THE SHORT FORM-36. RESULTS: FOLLOWING THE 10 WEEK INTERVENTION STRESS, ANXIETY AND QUALITY OF LIFE SCORES IMPROVED OVER TIME. YOGA WAS FOUND TO BE AS EFFECTIVE AS RELAXATION IN REDUCING STRESS, ANXIETY AND IMPROVING HEALTH STATUS ON SEVEN DOMAINS OF THE SF-36. YOGA WAS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN RELAXATION IN IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH. AT THE END OF THE 6 WEEK FOLLOW-UP PERIOD THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS IN LEVELS OF STRESS, ANXIETY AND ON FIVE DOMAINS OF THE SF-36. VITALITY, SOCIAL FUNCTION AND MENTAL HEALTH SCORES ON THE SF-36 WERE HIGHER IN THE RELAXATION GROUP DURING THE FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. CONCLUSION: YOGA APPEARS TO PROVIDE A COMPARABLE IMPROVEMENT IN STRESS, ANXIETY AND HEALTH STATUS COMPARED TO RELAXATION.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
12  282  56 ADHERENCE TO YOGA AND EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS IN A 6-MONTH CLINICAL TRIAL. BACKGROUND: TO DETERMINE FACTORS THAT PREDICT ADHERENCE TO A MIND-BODY INTERVENTION IN A RANDOMIZED TRIAL. DESIGN: WE ANALYZED ADHERENCE DATA FROM A 3-ARM TRIAL INVOLVING 135 GENERALLY HEALTHY SENIORS 65-85 YEARS OF AGE RANDOMIZED TO A 6-MONTH INTERVENTION CONSISTING OF: AN IYENGAR YOGA CLASS WITH HOME PRACTICE, AN EXERCISE CLASS WITH HOME PRACTICE, OR A WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP. OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED COGNITIVE FUNCTION, MOOD, FATIGUE, ANXIETY, HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, AND PHYSICAL MEASURES. ADHERENCE TO THE INTERVENTION WAS OBTAINED BY CLASS ATTENDANCE AND BIWEEKLY HOME PRACTICE LOGS. RESULTS: THE DROP-OUT RATE WAS 13%. AMONG THE COMPLETERS OF THE TWO ACTIVE INTERVENTIONS, AVERAGE YOGA CLASS ATTENDANCE WAS 77% AND HOME PRACTICE OCCURRED 64% OF ALL DAYS. AVERAGE EXERCISE CLASS ATTENDANCE WAS 69% AND HOME EXERCISE OCCURRED 54% OF ALL DAYS. THERE WERE NO CLEAR EFFECTS OF ADHERENCE ON THE SIGNIFICANT STUDY OUTCOMES (QUALITY OF LIFE AND PHYSICAL MEASURES). CLASS ATTENDANCE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH BASELINE MEASURES OF DEPRESSION, FATIGUE, AND PHYSICAL COMPONENTS OF HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN BASELINE MEASURES WERE ALSO FOUND BETWEEN STUDY COMPLETERS AND DROP-OUTS IN THE ACTIVE INTERVENTIONS. ADHERENCE WAS NOT RELATED TO AGE, GENDER, OR EDUCATION LEVEL. CONCLUSION: HEALTHY SENIORS HAVE GOOD ATTENDANCE AT CLASSES WITH A PHYSICALLY ACTIVE INTERVENTION. HOME PRACTICE TAKES PLACE OVER HALF OF THE TIME. DECREASED ADHERENCE TO A POTENTIALLY BENEFICIAL INTERVENTION HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DECREASE THE EFFECT OF THE INTERVENTION IN A CLINICAL TRIAL BECAUSE SUBJECTS WHO MIGHT SUSTAIN THE GREATEST BENEFIT WILL RECEIVE A LOWER DOSE OF THE INTERVENTION AND SUBJECTS WITH HIGHER ADHERENCE RATES MAY BE FUNCTIONING CLOSER TO MAXIMUM ABILITY BEFORE THE INTERVENTION. STRATEGIES TO MAXIMIZE ADHERENCE AMONG SUBJECTS AT GREATER RISK FOR LOW ADHERENCE WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR FUTURE TRIALS, ESPECIALLY COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENTS REQUIRING GREATER EFFORT THAN SIMPLE PILL-TAKING.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
13 2222  52 THE IMPACT OF MODIFIED HATHA YOGA ON CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN: A PILOT STUDY. PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS RANDOMIZED PILOT STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE A POSSIBLE DESIGN FOR A 6-WEEK MODIFIED HATHA YOGA PROTOCOL TO STUDY THE EFFECTS ON PARTICIPANTS WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN. PARTICIPANTS: TWENTY-TWO PARTICIPANTS (M = 4; F = 17), BETWEEN THE AGES OF 30 AND 65, WITH CHRONIC LOW BACK PAIN (CLBP) WERE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER AN IMMEDIATE YOGA BASED INTERVENTION, OR TO A CONTROL GROUP WITH NO TREATMENT DURING THE OBSERVATION PERIOD BUT RECEIVED LATER YOGA TRAINING. METHODS: A SPECIFIC CLBP YOGA PROTOCOL DESIGNED AND MODIFIED FOR THIS POPULATION BY A CERTIFIED YOGA INSTRUCTOR WAS ADMINISTERED FOR ONE HOUR, TWICE A WEEK FOR 6 WEEKS. PRIMARY FUNCTIONAL OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED THE FORWARD REACH (FR) AND SIT AND REACH (SR) TESTS. ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED OSWESTRY DISABILITY INDEX (ODI) AND BECK DEPRESSION INVENTORY (BDI) QUESTIONNAIRES. GUIDING QUESTIONS WERE USED FOR QUALITATIVE DATA ANALYSIS TO ASCERTAIN HOW YOGA PARTICIPANTS PERCEIVED THE INSTRUCTOR, GROUP DYNAMICS, AND THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON THEIR LIFE. ANALYSIS: TO ACCOUNT FOR DROP OUTS, THE DATA WERE DIVIDED INTO BETTER OR NOT CATEGORIES, AND ANALYZED USING CHI-SQUARE TO EXAMINE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GROUPS. QUALITATIVE DATA WERE ANALYZED THROUGH FREQUENCY OF POSITIVE RESPONSES. RESULTS: POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT TRENDS IN THE FUNCTIONAL MEASUREMENT SCORES SHOWED IMPROVED BALANCE AND FLEXIBILITY AND DECREASED DISABILITY AND DEPRESSION FOR THE YOGA GROUP BUT THIS PILOT WAS NOT POWERED TO REACH STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. SIGNIFICANT LIMITATIONS INCLUDED A HIGH DROPOUT RATE IN THE CONTROL GROUP AND LARGE BASELINE DIFFERENCES IN THE SECONDARY MEASURES. IN ADDITION, ANALYSIS OF THE QUALITATIVE DATA REVEALED THE FOLLOWING FREQUENCY OF RESPONSES (1) GROUP INTERVENTION MOTIVATED THE PARTICIPANTS AND (2) YOGA FOSTERED RELAXATION AND NEW AWARENESS/LEARNING. CONCLUSION: A MODIFIED YOGA-BASED INTERVENTION MAY BENEFIT INDIVIDUALS WITH CLB, BUT A LARGER STUDY IS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE DEFINITIVE EVIDENCE. ALSO, THE IMPACT ON DEPRESSION AND DISABILITY COULD BE CONSIDERED AS IMPORTANT OUTCOMES FOR FURTHER STUDY. ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONAL OUTCOME MEASURES SHOULD BE EXPLORED. THIS PILOT STUDY SUPPORTS THE NEED FOR MORE RESEARCH INVESTIGATING THE EFFECT OF YOGA FOR THIS POPULATION.	2004	
                                                                                                                                                                                                       
14  188  55 A RANDOMIZED PREFERENCE TRIAL OF COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY AND YOGA FOR THE TREATMENT OF WORRY IN ANXIOUS OLDER ADULTS. BACKGROUND: WORRY IS A COMMON PROBLEM AMONG OLDER ADULTS. COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY IS THE MOST STUDIED NONPHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTION AND IT HAS DEMONSTRATED EFFICACY IN REDUCING LATE-LIFE WORRY AND ANXIETY. ALTHOUGH THE EVIDENCE-BASE IS SMALLER, YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE ANXIETY AND STRESS. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE RELATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE TWO NONPHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS. FURTHER, THE IMPACT OF PATIENT PREFERENCE ON OUTCOMES IS UNKNOWN.PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE TO THIS STUDY IS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY (CBT) WITH YOGA FOR IMPROVING LATE-LIFE WORRY, ANXIETY, AND SLEEP. WE WILL ALSO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF PREFERENCE AND SELECTION ON OUTCOMES, ADHERENCE, AND ATTRITION. METHODS: WE ARE CONDUCTING A TWO-STAGE RANDOMIZED PREFERENCE TRIAL COMPARING CBT AND YOGA FOR THE REDUCTION OF WORRY IN A SAMPLE OF ANXIOUS OLDER ADULTS. FIVE HUNDRED PARTICIPANTS WILL BE RANDOMIZED TO EITHER THE PREFERENCE TRIAL (PARTICIPANTS CHOOSE THE INTERVENTION; N=250) OR TO THE RANDOMIZED TRIAL (PARTICIPANTS ARE RANDOMIZED TO ONE OF THE TWO INTERVENTIONS; N=250) WITH EQUAL PROBABILITY. CBT CONSISTS OF 10 TELEPHONE-BASED SESSIONS WITH AN ACCOMPANYING WORKBOOK. YOGA CONSISTS OF 10 WEEKS OF GROUP YOGA CLASSES (TWICE A WEEK) THAT IS MODIFIED FOR USE WITH OLDER ADULTS. CONCLUSIONS: THE STUDY DESIGN IS BASED ON FEEDBACK FROM ANXIOUS OLDER ADULTS WHO WANTED MORE NONPHARMACOLOGICAL OPTIONS FOR INTERVENTION AS WELL AS MORE INPUT INTO THE INTERVENTION THEY RECEIVE. IT IS THE FIRST HEAD-TO-HEAD COMPARISON OF CBT AND YOGA FOR REDUCING LATE-LIFE WORRY AND ANXIETY. IT WILL ALSO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT HOW INTERVENTION PREFERENCE AFFECTS OUTCOMES.

15 2628  46 YOGA FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF PAIN AND SLEEP IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS: A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE FEASIBILITY OF A RELAXATION-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, DESIGNED AND REPORTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH DELPHI RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED FROM A HOSPITAL DATABASE, AND RANDOMIZED TO EITHER EIGHT WEEKLY 75-MIN YOGA CLASSES OR A USUAL CARE CONTROL. FEASIBILITY WAS DETERMINED BY RECRUITMENT RATES, RETENTION, PROTOCOL ADHERENCE, PARTICIPANT SATISFACTION AND ADVERSE EVENTS. SECONDARY PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED USING SELF-REPORTED QUESTIONNAIRES AT BASELINE (WEEK 0), WEEK 9 (PRIMARY TIME POINT) AND WEEK 12 (FOLLOW-UP). RESULTS: OVER A 3-MONTH PERIOD, 26 PARTICIPANTS WITH MILD PAIN, MILD TO MODERATE FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY AND MODERATE DISEASE ACTIVITY WERE RECRUITED INTO THE STUDY (25% RECRUITMENT RATE). RETENTION RATES WERE 100% FOR YOGA PARTICIPANTS AND 92% FOR USUAL CARE PARTICIPANTS AT BOTH WEEKS 9 AND 12. PROTOCOL ADHERENCE AND PARTICIPANT SATISFACTION WERE HIGH. YOGA PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED A MEDIAN OF SEVEN CLASSES; ADDITIONALLY, SEVEN OF THE YOGA PARTICIPANTS (54%) REPORTED CONTINUING YOGA AT HOME DURING THE FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS WERE RELATED TO THE STUDY. SECONDARY OUTCOMES SHOWED NO GROUP EFFECTS OF YOGA COMPARED WITH USUAL CARE. CONCLUSIONS: A RELAXATION-BASED YOGA PROGRAMME WAS FOUND TO BE FEASIBLE AND SAFE FOR PARTICIPANTS WITH RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS-RELATED PAIN AND FUNCTIONAL DISABILITY. ADVERSE EVENTS WERE MINOR, AND NOT UNEXPECTED FROM AN INTERVENTION INCLUDING PHYSICAL COMPONENTS. THIS PILOT PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR LARGER INTERVENTION STUDIES, AND SUPPORTS FURTHER EXPLORATION OF YOGA AS A COMPLEX INTERVENTION TO ASSIST WITH THE MANAGEMENT OF RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
16 2508  58 YOGA BREATHING FOR CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY-ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE: RESULTS OF A PILOT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: MANY DEBILITATING SYMPTOMS ARISE FROM CANCER AND ITS TREATMENT THAT ARE OFTEN UNRELIEVED BY ESTABLISHED METHODS. PRANAYAMA, A SERIES OF YOGIC BREATHING TECHNIQUES, MAY IMPROVE CANCER-RELATED SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE, BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED FOR THIS PURPOSE. OBJECTIVES: A PILOT STUDY WAS PERFORMED TO EVALUATE FEASIBILITY AND TO TEST THE EFFECTS OF PRANAYAMA ON CANCER-ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE. DESIGN: THIS WAS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL COMPARING PRANAYAMA TO USUAL CARE. SETTING: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT A UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER. SUBJECTS: PATIENTS RECEIVING CANCER CHEMOTHERAPY WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE PRANAYAMA IMMEDIATELY OR AFTER A WAITING PERIOD (CONTROL GROUP). INTERVENTIONS: THE PRANAYAMA INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF FOUR BREATHING TECHNIQUES TAUGHT IN WEEKLY CLASSES AND PRACTICED AT HOME. THE TREATMENT GROUP RECEIVED PRANAYAMA DURING TWO CONSECUTIVE CYCLES OF CHEMOTHERAPY. THE CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED USUAL CARE DURING THEIR FIRST CYCLE, AND RECEIVED PRANAYAMA DURING THEIR SECOND CYCLE OF CHEMOTHERAPY. OUTCOME MEASURES: FEASIBILITY, CANCER-ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS (FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, STRESS), AND QUALITY OF LIFE WERE THE OUTCOMES. RESULTS: CLASS ATTENDANCE WAS NEARLY 100% IN BOTH GROUPS. SIXTEEN (16) PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE FINAL INTENT-TO-TREAT ANALYSES. THE REPEATED-MEASURES ANALYSES DEMONSTRATED THAT ANY INCREASE IN PRANAYAMA DOSE, WITH DOSE MEASURED IN THE NUMBER OF HOURS PRACTICED IN CLASS OR AT HOME, RESULTED IN IMPROVED SYMPTOM AND QUALITY-OF-LIFE SCORES. SEVERAL OF THESE ASSOCIATIONS--SLEEP DISTURBANCE (P=0.04), ANXIETY (P=0.04), AND MENTAL QUALITY OF LIFE (P=0.05)--REACHED OR APPROACHED STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA BREATHING WAS A FEASIBLE INTERVENTION AMONG PATIENTS WITH CANCER RECEIVING CHEMOTHERAPY. PRANAYAMA MAY IMPROVE SLEEP DISTURBANCE, ANXIETY, AND MENTAL QUALITY OF LIFE. A DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIP WAS FOUND BETWEEN PRANAYAMA USE AND IMPROVEMENTS IN CHEMOTHERAPY-ASSOCIATED SYMPTOMS AND QUALITY OF LIFE. THESE FINDINGS NEED TO BE CONFIRMED IN A LARGER STUDY.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
17  177  51 A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF MINDFULNESS VERSUS YOGA: EFFECTS ON DEPRESSION AND/OR ANXIETY IN COLLEGE STUDENTS. BACKGROUND: DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY DISORDERS ARE TWO OF THE MOST COMMON MENTAL DISORDERS IN THE UNITED STATES. THESE DISORDERS ARE PREVALENT AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS. OBJECTIVE: THE MAIN OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY IS TO COMPARE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF INTERVENTION PRACTICES (MINDFULNESS VS. YOGA) AND A NONINTERVENTIONAL CONTROL GROUP IN MITIGATING THE EFFECTS OF DEPRESSION AND/OR ANXIETY IN COLLEGE STUDENTS. METHOD: A SAMPLE OF 90 STUDENTS (BOTH GENDERS) OVER AGE 18 WHO HAD A DIAGNOSIS OF ANXIETY AND/OR DEPRESSION WAS RECRUITED FROM 11,500 UNDERGRADUATE COLLEGE STUDENTS IN A MID-SIZE UNIVERSITY. THE STUDY'S DESIGN INCLUDED STRATIFIED-RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED REPEATED MEASURES WITH THREE GROUPS: A MINDFULNESS INTERVENTION GROUP, A YOGA-ONLY INTERVENTION GROUP, AND A NONINTERVENTIONAL GROUP. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO THE AFOREMENTIONED THREE GROUPS. PARTICIPANTS IN THE INTERVENTION GROUPS RECEIVED AN 8-WEEK TRAINING EITHER IN MINDFULNESS OR YOGA. DEPRESSIVE, ANXIETY, STRESS SYMPTOMS, SELF-COMPASSION, AND MINDFULNESS WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE, WEEK 4, WEEK 8, AND WEEK 12. RESULTS: DEPRESSIVE, ANXIETY, AND STRESS SYMPTOMS DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (P < .01) FROM BASELINE TO FOLLOW-UP CONDITIONS IN BOTH THE MINDFULNESS AND YOGA INTERVENTION GROUPS. THE CHANGES IN MINDFULNESS SCORES WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANT IN BOTH GROUPS. HOWEVER, THE CHANGES IN SELF-COMPASSION SCORES WERE SIGNIFICANT ONLY IN THE MINDFULNESS INTERVENTION GROUP. NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE CONTROL GROUP WERE DEMONSTRATED. CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY CAN PROVIDE USEFUL INFORMATION TO NURSES AND OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. THIS STUDY MAY HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR A COST-EFFECTIVE TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
18 2096  54 THE EFFECT OF YOGA EXERCISE ON IMPROVING DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND FATIGUE IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND FATIGUE ARE AMONG THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS THAT INFLUENCE THE QUALITY OF LIFE OF PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER WHO RECEIVE ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY. ALTHOUGH EVIDENCE HAS SHOWN YOGA TO DECREASE ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER, FEW STUDIES ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA HAVE TARGETED PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. YOGA INTERVENTIONS SHOULD BE TESTED TO PROMOTE THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH OF WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER. PURPOSE: THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AN 8-WEEK YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM IN PROMOTING THE PSYCHOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH OF WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER UNDERGOING ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY IN TERMS OF DEPRESSION, ANXIETY, AND FATIGUE. METHODS: A SAMPLE OF 60 WOMEN WITH NONMETASTATIC BREAST CANCER WAS RECRUITED. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED INTO EITHER THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP (N = 30) OR THE CONTROL GROUP (N = 30). A 60-MINUTE, TWICE-PER-WEEK YOGA EXERCISE WAS IMPLEMENTED FOR 8 WEEKS AS THE INTERVENTION FOR THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP. THE CONTROL GROUP RECEIVED STANDARD CARE ONLY. RESULTS: ANALYSIS USING THE JOHNSON-NEYMAN PROCEDURE FOUND THAT THE YOGA EXERCISE REDUCED OVERALL FATIGUE AND THE INTERFERENCE OF FATIGUE IN EVERYDAY LIFE FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PARTICIPANTS. SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS WERE OBTAINED AFTER 4 WEEKS OF INTERVENTION PARTICIPATION FOR THOSE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP PATIENTS WITH RELATIVELY LOW STARTING BASELINE VALUES (BASELINE ITEM MEAN VALUE < 3.31 AND 3.22, RESPECTIVELY) AND AFTER 8 WEEKS FOR MOST PATIENTS (APPROXIMATELY 75%) WITH MODERATE STARTING BASELINE VALUES (BASELINE ITEM MEAN VALUE < 7.30 AND 5.34, RESPECTIVELY). THE 8-WEEK INTERVENTION DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE THE LEVELS OF DEPRESSION (F = 1.29, P > .05) OR ANXIETY (F = 2.7, P > .05). CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: THE 8-WEEK YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM DEVELOPED IN THIS STUDY EFFECTIVELY REDUCED FATIGUE IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER BUT DID NOT REDUCE DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY. ONCOLOGY NURSES SHOULD STRENGTHEN THEIR CLINICAL HEALTH EDUCATION AND APPLY YOGA TO REDUCE THE FATIGUE EXPERIENCED BY PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER WHO UNDERGO ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
19 2553  37 YOGA FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS AFTER COMPLETING CANCER TREATMENT. SURVIVORS OF CHILDHOOD CANCER MAY EXPERIENCE PERSISTENT SYMPTOMS, INCLUDING FATIGUE, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, AND BALANCE IMPAIRMENT. YOGA IS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY THAT IMPROVES FATIGUE, SLEEP, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN ADULT CANCER SURVIVORS. USING A ONE GROUP, REPEATED MEASURES DESIGN, WE EVALUATED THE FEASIBILITY OF A YOGA PROGRAM AND ASSESSED IF CANCER SURVIVOR PARTICIPANTS AGES 10 TO 17 YEARS (N = 13) HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LESS FATIGUE AND ANXIETY, AND BETTER BALANCE AND SLEEP, AFTER A 6-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION COMPARED WITH A 6-WEEK PRE-INTERVENTION WAIT PERIOD. STUDY RECRUITMENT WAS CHALLENGING WITH A 32% ENROLLMENT RATE; YOGA ATTENDANCE WAS 90%. NONE OF THE SCORES FOR ANXIETY, FATIGUE, SLEEP, AND BALANCE HAD SIGNIFICANT CHANGES DURING THE WAIT PERIOD. AFTER THE 6-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM, CHILDREN (N = 7) HAD A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN ANXIETY SCORE (P = .04) WHILE ADOLESCENT SCORES (N = 7) SHOWED A DECREASING TREND (P = .10). SCORES FOR FATIGUE, SLEEP, AND BALANCE REMAINED STABLE POST-INTERVENTION. FATIGUE AND BALANCE SCORES WERE BELOW NORMS FOR HEALTH CHILDREN/ADOLESCENTS WHILE SLEEP AND ANXIETY SCORES WERE SIMILAR TO HEALTHY PEERS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
20  444  29 CHAIR YOGA: BENEFITS FOR COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS. THE AIM OF THIS PILOT STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE WHETHER CHAIR YOGA WAS EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING PAIN LEVEL AND IMPROVING PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND EMOTIONAL WELL-BEING IN A SAMPLE OF COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS. ONE-WAY REPEATED MEASURES ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE WAS PERFORMED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CHAIR YOGA AT BASELINE, MIDPOINT (4 WEEKS), AND END OF THE INTERVENTION (8 WEEKS). ALTHOUGH CHAIR YOGA WAS EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND REDUCING STIFFNESS IN OLDER ADULTS WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS, IT WAS NOT EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING PAIN LEVEL OR IMPROVING DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. FUTURE RESEARCH PLANNED BY THIS TEAM WILL USE RIGOROUS STUDY METHODS, INCLUDING LARGER SAMPLES, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS, AND FOLLOW UP FOR MONITORING HOME PRACTICE AFTER THE INTERVENTIONS.	2012

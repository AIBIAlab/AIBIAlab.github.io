1  624 122 DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2 AND YOGA: ELECTRO PHOTONIC IMAGING PERSPECTIVE. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS THE MOST POPULAR FORM OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2. THE ELECTRO-PHOTONIC IMAGING (EPI) IS ANOTHER CONTRIBUTION FROM ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE IN HEALTH MONITORING. AIM: TO EVALUATE DIABETES FROM EPI PERSPECTIVE. OBJECTIVES: (1) COMPARE VARIOUS EPI PARAMETERS IN NORMAL, PREDIABETIC AND DIABETIC PATIENTS. (2) FIND DIFFERENCE IN CONTROLLED AND UNCONTROLLED DIABETES. (3) STUDY THE EFFECT OF 7 DAYS DIABETES-SPECIFIC YOGA PROGRAM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: FOR THE FIRST OBJECTIVE, THERE WERE 102 PATIENTS (NORMAL 29, PREDIABETIC 13, DIABETIC 60). IN THE SECOND STUDY, THERE WERE 60 PATIENTS (CONTROLLED DIABETES 27, UNCONTROLLED DIABETES 33). THE THIRD STUDY COMPRISED 37 PATIENTS. EPI PARAMETERS WERE RELATED TO GENERAL HEALTH AS WELL TO SPECIFIC ORGANS. RESULTS: IN THE FIRST STUDY, SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED BETWEEN (1) DIABETICS AND NORMAL: AVERAGE INTENSITY 5.978, FORM COEFFICIENT 3.590, IMMUNE ORGANS 0.281 ALL P < 0.001; (2) DIABETICS AND PREDIABETICS: AVERAGE INTENSITY 6.676, FORM COEFFICIENT 4.158, IMMUNE ORGANS 5.890 P < 0.032; (3) NORMAL AND PREDIABETES: IMMUNE ORGANS (-6.171 P = 000). IN THE SECOND STUDY, REMARKABLE DIFFERENCE WAS IN THE IMMUNE ORGANS (0.201, P = 0.031). IN THE PRE- AND POST-STUDY, THE MEAN DIFFERENCE WAS: AREA 630.37, FORM COEFFICIENT 1.78, ENTROPY 0.03, LIVER 0.24, PANCREAS 0.17, CORONARY VESSELS 0.11, AND LEFT KIDNEY 29, WITH ALL P < 0.02. CONCLUSION: THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN EPI PARAMETERS BETWEEN NORMAL, PREDIABETICS AND DIABETICS, THE PROMINENT BEING AVERAGE INTENSITY, FORM COEFFICIENT, AND IMMUNE ORGANS. BETWEEN CONTROLLED AND UNCONTROLLED DIABETES, IMMUNE ORGANS SHOW SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. INTERVENTION OF YOGA RESULTS IN CHANGE IN MOST PARAMETERS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
2 1849  33 QUASI PROSPECTIVE COMPARATIVE STUDY ON EFFECT OF YOGA AMONG PREDIABETICS ON PROGRESSION OF CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS. INTRODUCTION: PREDIABETIC PATIENTS HAVE HIGHER RISK FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES, WHICH FURTHER INCREASES THE RATE OF MORTALITY. REASON FOR THE RATE OF INCREASE MAY BE LACK OF OBSERVATION, FOLLOW-UP PROGRAMS, AND SELF-AWARENESS ABOUT THE CONDITIONS OF DISEASE. LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS YOGA CAN PROVE TO BE A BENEFICIAL NONPHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTION IN PREVENTING PROGRESSION OF PREDIABETES TO TYPE 2 DIABETES. THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHTS IMPORTANCE OF SHORT-TERM INTERVENTION, I.E., YOGA IN PREDIABETIC PATIENTS AND USE IT AS A TOOL FOR PRIMARY PREVENTION OF DIABETES. METHODS: THIS WAS AN INTERVENTIONAL STUDY AMONG ADULTS AGED 30-50 YEARS IN RUHS COLLEGE OF MEDICAL SCIENCES AND ASSOCIATED RUKMANI DEVI BENI PRASAD JAIPURIA HOSPITAL IN JAIPUR CITY. THE DESIGN OF STUDY WAS QUASI PROSPECTIVE COMPARATIVE STUDY. A TOTAL OF 102 PREDIABETIC PATIENTS OF AGE GROUP 30-50 YEARS WERE RECRUITED FROM JAIPURIA HOSPITAL. THESE WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: STUDY GROUP (GROUP A, N = 51) WERE ENGAGED IN YOGA SESSION AND CONTROL GROUP (B, N = 51) NOT PERFORMED ANY YOGA SESSION. RESULTS: YOGA INTERVENTION RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN BLOOD GLUCOSE (P < 0.001), GLYCATED HEMOGLOBIN (P < 0.01), LIPID PROFILE CHOLESTEROL (P < 0.01), TRIGLYCERIDE (P < 0.01), AND LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (P < 0.01), BUT HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (P < 0.02) AND VERY LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN INCREASE (P < 0.03) BUT NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RELATIVE TO THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: SHORT-TERM YOGA INTERVENTION IS HELPFUL IN THE CONTROL OF GLYCEMIC PARAMETERS LIKE BLOOD GLUCOSE, GLYCATED HEMOGLOBIN AND LIPID PROFILE IN PREDIABETIC PATIENTS. THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY INDICATES THAT A YOGA PROGRAM WOULD BE A POSSIBLE RISK REDUCTION OPTION FOR ADULTS AT HIGH RISK FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES. IN ADDITION, YOGA HOLDS PROMISE AS AN APPROACH TO REDUCING CARDIOMETABOLIC RISK FACTORS AND INCREASING EXERCISE SELF-EFFICACY FOR PREDIABETICS PERFORMING YOGA.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
3  785  38 EFFECT OF YOGA BASED TECHNIQUES ON STRESS AND HEALTH INDICES USING ELECTRO PHOTONIC IMAGING TECHNIQUE IN MANAGERS. BACKGROUND: MEDITATION TECHNIQUES ARE KNOWN TO ELICIT RELAXATION RESPONSE IN WHICH MOVING MEDITATION WHICH COMBINES THE PRACTICE OF YOGA POSTURES AND GUIDED RELAXATION IS KNOWN AS CYCLIC MEDITATION REPORTED HELPFUL IN REDUCING THE SYMPATHETIC AROUSAL AND IMPROVING HEALTH OF PRACTITIONERS. OBJECTIVES: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF CYCLIC MEDITATION ON STRESS AND HEALTH INDICES IN MANAGERS AS MEASURED BY ELECTRO PHOTONIC IMAGING (EPI) TECHNIQUE. MATERIALS AND METHODS: EPI TECHNIQUE WAS USED TO ASSESS PARTICIPANTS BEFORE AND AFTER 35 MIN OF CYCLIC MEDITATION (CM) AND EQUAL DURATION OF SUPINE REST (SR) SESSION. A TOTAL OF SIXTY SIX MALE MANAGERS, AGE RANGES FROM 35 TO 60 YEARS (MEAN +/- SD 53.97 +/- 5.96) WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. EPI PARAMETERS, INCLUDING ACTIVATION COEFFICIENT, INTEGRAL AREA LEFT AND RIGHT AND INTEGRAL ENTROPY, LEFT AND RIGHT WERE TAKEN FOR STATISTICAL ANALYSES. RESULTS: CYCLIC MEDITATION HAS PRODUCED A HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN STRESS LEVEL, WHEREAS THIS REDUCTION WAS NOT FOUND SIGNIFICANT WITHIN SR GROUP. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN HEALTH INDEX 'INTEGRAL AREA' VALUES IN BOTH LEFT AND RIGHT SIDES WITHIN THE CM GROUP WHILE ONLY IA RIGHT SIDE SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT WITHIN THE CM GROUP. THE INTEGRAL ENTROPY VALUE RIGHT SIDE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY WITHIN THE CM GROUP, WHEREAS IE LEFT WAS FOUND DETERIORATED WITHIN THE SR GROUP. MOREOVER, ONLY IE LEFT SIDE HAS SHOWN A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GROUPS. CONCLUSION: THE INVESTIGATIONS IN THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT CYCLIC MEDITATION PRACTICE REDUCES STRESS AND IMPROVES PSYCHOSOMATIC HEALTH INDICES MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN SUPINE REST IN MANAGERS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
4  876  40 EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY ON REACTION TIME, BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS AND WELLNESS SCORE OF PERI AND POST-MENOPAUSAL DIABETIC PATIENTS. BACKGROUND: YOGIC PRACTICES MAY AID IN THE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES MELLITUS (DM) AND REDUCE CARDIOVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS IN THE POPULATION. THE PRESENT STUDY HAS BEEN UNDERTAKEN TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY ON REACTION TIME, BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS AND WELLNESS SCORE OF PERI AND POST-MENOPAUSAL DIABETIC PATIENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 15 PERI AND POST-MENOPAUSAL PATIENTS RECEIVING STANDARD MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR TYPE 2 DM WERE RECRUITED AND REACTION TIME AND BIOCHEMICAL INVESTIGATIONS WERE DONE BEFORE AND AFTER A COMPREHENSIVE YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM COMPRISING OF THREE TIMES A WEEK SESSIONS FOR SIX WEEKS. A POST-INTERVENTION, RETROSPECTIVE WELLNESS QUESTIONNAIRE COMPILED BY ACYTER WAS USED TO EVALUATE THE COMPARATIVE FEELINGS OF THE PATIENTS AFTER THE THERAPY PROGRAM. RESULTS: YOGA TRAINING REDUCED AUDITORY REACTION TIME (ART) FROM RIGHT AS WELL AS LEFT HAND, THE DECREASE BEING STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P<0.05) FOR ART FROM THE RIGHT HAND. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT (P<0.01) DECREASE IN FASTING AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS AS WELL AS LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN. THE DECREASE IN TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDES, AND VERY LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN AND INCREASE IN HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN WAS ALSO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P<0.05). ALL THE LIPID RATIOS SHOWED DESIRABLE IMPROVEMENT WITH A DECREASE (P<0.01) OF TC/HDL AND LDL/HDL RATIOS AND INCREASE (P<0.05) IN THE HDL/LDL RATIO. DISCUSSION OR CONCLUSION: SHORTENING OF RT IMPLIES AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE INFORMATION PROCESSING AND REFLEXES AND IS THE FIRST SUCH REPORT IN DIABETIC PATIENTS. THIS HAS CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE AND IS WORTH FURTHER EXPLORATION WITH WIDER, WELL CONTROLLED, RANDOMIZED STUDIES IN THE DIABETIC POPULATION. CHANGES IN BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS MAY BE DUE TO IMPROVED INSULIN SENSITIVITY, DECLINE IN INSULIN RESISTANCE AND INCREASED SENSITIVITY OF THE PANCREATIC B CELLS TO GLUCOSE SIGNALS. YOGA IMPROVED THE 'HEART FRIENDLY' STATUS OF LIPID PROFILE IN OUR SUBJECTS AND AS OUR PARTICIPANTS WERE PERI AND POST-MENOPAUSAL, THE DECREASE IN CARDIOVASCULAR RISK PROFILE IS OF GREATER SIGNIFICANCE. A COMPREHENSIVE YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ENHANCE THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF STANDARD MEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES MELLITUS AND CAN BE USED AS AN EFFECTIVE COMPLEMENTARY OR INTEGRATIVE THERAPY PROGRAM.	2012	

5  823  29 EFFECT OF YOGA ON GLUCOSE CONTROL AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS OF PREDIABETES. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE EFFECT OF YOGA ON FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE (FPG), POSTPRANDIAL PLASMA GLUCOSE, AND HEMOGLOBIN A1C (HBA1C) AND ALSO ON QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: THIS WAS A COHORT STUDY IN WHICH 100 DIAGNOSED CASES OF PREDIABETES WERE RECRUITED FOR DOING SPECIFIC YOGA, AND THEY THEMSELVES ACT AS CONTROL FOR THE STUDY. THE MEASUREMENT AND COMPARISON OF FPG, PRANDIAL PLASMA GLUCOSE (PPG), AND HBA1C WERE DONE AT THREE DIFFERENT TIME INTERVALS, THAT IS, BASELINE, 3 MONTHS, AND AT 6 MONTHS. THE ASSESSMENT OF QOL WAS DONE USING SF-36 SCALE. RESULTS: ONE HUNDRED PREDIABETIC CASES WERE SELECTED FOR THE STUDY IN WHICH IMPAIRED FASTING GLUCOSE (IFG) WAS PRESENT MORE IN YOUNGER POPULATION COMPARED TO IMPAIRED GLUCOSE TOLERANCE (IGT) AND IFG PLUS IGT BOTH OF WHICH ARE MORE PREVALENT IN MIDDLE AGE GROUP. THE YOGA THERAPY WAS FOUND TO HAVE FAVORABLE EFFECT ON FPG, PPG, AND HBA1C ALONG WITH VARIOUS ANTHROPOMETRY MEASURES STUDIED IN THIS STUDY. AFTER ADJUSTING CORRELATION COEFFICIENT FOR VARIOUS ANTHROPOMETRY MEASURES, YOGA WAS FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR CONTROLLING GLYCEMIC PARAMETERS IN PREDIABETICS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA IS A TYPE OF EXERCISE KNOWN TO IMPROVE GLYCEMIC CONTROL BY CHANGING ANTHROPOMETRY MEASURES, BUT OUR STUDY AIDS IN KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT BEYOND THIS KNOWN FACT THROUGH OTHER MECHANISMS YET TO BE EXPLORED.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
6 1805  25 PREVALENCE OF TYPE 2 DIABETES AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS: A PILOT CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY IN TWO DISTRICTS IN INDIA. INTRODUCTION: DIABETES IS ONE OF THE MAJOR HEALTH DISEASES IN THE WORLD TODAY. THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES IS WELL-ESTABLISHED. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE PREVALENCE OF TYPE 2 DIABETES AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS IN TWO DISTRICTS OF INDIA (ONE EACH IN WEST AND SOUTH OF INDIA). METHODOLOGY: IN THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL FIELD STUDY, 155 YOGA PRACTITIONERS FROM PUNE AND 192 FROM ERNAKULAM DISTRICTS WERE ASSESSED USING THE DIABETES RISK TEST AND FASTING BLOOD SUGAR. THE DATA COLLECTED WERE ENTERED IN A STATISTICS SOFTWARE PACKAGE AND ANALYZED USING THE PEARSON'S CORRELATION ANALYSIS, T-TEST, UNIVARIATE ANOVA, AND LINEAR REGRESSION TO UNDERSTAND THE PREDICTORS OF RISK FOR DIABETES. RESULTS: THE OVERALL PREVALENCE OF DIABETES AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS IN CENTRAL PUNE WAS 3.6% (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI]: [0.01-0.04]). 18.9% OF PARTICIPANTS (95% CI: [0.16-0.19]) WERE DIAGNOSED TO BE "AT RISK" FOR DIABETES. IN ERNAKULAM, THE OVERALL PREVALENCE OF DIABETES AMONG PRACTITIONERS WAS 26% (95% CI: [0.05-0.06]) WITH 12% OF PRACTITIONERS (95% CI: [0.05-0.06]) DIAGNOSED TO BE "AT RISK" FOR DIABETES (PREDIABETIC). HIGHER AGE AND LESSER DURATION OF YOGA PRACTICE WERE SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS OF DIABETES. CONCLUSION: IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR EVERY PERSON ABOVE THE AGE OF 40 TO UNDERGO REGULAR HEALTH CHECK-UPS AND SCREENING FOR DIABETES AND INVOLVE ONESELF IN LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION PROGRAMS SUCH AS YOGA FOR SIGNIFICANTLY LONG DURATION OF TIME ON A DAILY BASIS, TO BETTER MANAGE DIABETES.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
7 1703  33 PARTITIONING OF RADIOLOGICAL, STRESS AND BIOCHEMICAL CHANGES IN PRE-DIABETIC WOMEN SUBJECTED TO DIABETIC YOGA PROTOCOL. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS AN ANCIENT SYSTEM OF WELLNESS WITH ASANA AND PRANAYAMA AS ITS MOST POPULAR AND PROPAGATED MODULES FOR MANAGEMENT OF LIFESTYLE DISORDERS. OBJECTIVES: THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO CHARACTERISE THE LIVER ABNORMALITIES, BIOCHEMICAL CHANGES, AND STRESS LEVELS AFTER YOGA INTERVENTION IN PREDIABETIC FEMALES. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 37 FEMALES WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO YOGA PRACTISING AND NON-PRACTISING CONTROL GROUPS. THE YOGA PRACTISING GROUP PERFORMED DIABETIC YOGA PROTOCOL (DYP) FOR 3 MONTHS. PARAMETERS INCLUDING SIZE OF LIVER, FATTY INFILTRATION, AND GRADE OF SEVERITY WERE MEASURED USING ULTRASONOGRAPHY ALONG WITH BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS AND STRESS LEVELS AT BASELINE AND AFTER YOGA PRACTICE. RESULTS: THE GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN (HBA1C) AND GLUCOSE LEVELS WERE FOUND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED IN PREDIABETIC (P=0.015) WOMEN AFTER PRACTISING DYP, ALTHOUGH CHOLESTEROL LEVELS INCREASED IN MENOPAUSAL WOMEN. NO ESCALATION OF FATTY LIVER WAS NOTED AMONG WOMEN PRACTISING DYP. CONCLUSION: DYP REDUCED THE HBA1C AND STRESS LEVELS AND THEREFORE, COULD BE A COST-EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR PREVENTING PREDIABETES TO DIABETES PROGRESSION.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
8 1473  24 INSULIN SENSITIVITY AND CARDIAC AUTONOMIC FUNCTION IN YOUNG MALE PRACTITIONERS OF YOGA. BACKGROUND: WHILE YOGA IS THOUGHT TO REDUCE THE RISK OF CHRONIC NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES SUCH AS DIABETES, THERE ARE NO STUDIES ON INSULIN SENSITIVITY IN LONG TERM PRACTITIONERS OF YOGA. WE ASSESSED INSULIN SENSITIVITY AND CARDIAC AUTONOMIC FUNCTION IN LONG TERM PRACTITIONERS OF YOGA. METHODS: FIFTEEN HEALTHY, YOUNG, MALE PRACTITIONERS OF YOGA WERE COMPARED WITH 15 YOUNG, HEALTHY MALES WHO DID NOT PRACTICE YOGA MATCHED FOR BODY-MASS INDEX. FASTING INSULIN SENSITIVITY WAS MEASURED IN THE FASTING STATE BY THE HYPERINSULINAEMIC-EUGLYCAEMIC CLAMP. RESULTS: THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GROUPS IN THEIR ANTHROPOMETRY OR BODY COMPOSITION. HOWEVER, THE FASTING PLASMA INSULIN WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN THE YOGA GROUP. THE YOGA GROUP WAS ALSO MORE INSULIN SENSITIVE (YOGA 7.82 [2.29] V. CONTROL 4.86 [11.97] (MG/[KG.MIN])/(MICROU/ML), P < 0.001). WHILE THE BODY WEIGHT AND WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE WERE NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH GLUCOSE DISPOSAL RATE IN THE CONTROLS, THERE WERE NO SIMILAR CORRELATIONS IN THE YOGA GROUP. THE YOGA GROUP HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER LOW-FREQUENCY POWER AND LOWER NORMALIZED HIGH-FREQUENCY POWER. CONCLUSION: LONG TERM YOGA PRACTICE (FOR 1 YEAR OR MORE) IS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED INSULIN SENSITIVITY AND ATTENUATES THE NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BODY WEIGHT OR WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE AND INSULIN SENSITIVITY.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
9 1366  30 IMPACT OF A 10 MINUTE SEATED YOGA PRACTICE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES. OBJECTIVE: WE SOUGHT TO PROSPECTIVELY EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF A 10 MINUTE SEATED YOGA PROGRAM ADDED TO STANDARD COMPREHENSIVE DIABETES CARE ON GLUCOSE CONTROL AND CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH IN THE SEVERELY ILL, MEDICALLY COMPLEX DIABETIC POPULATION. METHOD: A TOTAL OF 10 PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES, AGES 49-77, WITH DURATION OF DIABETES >10 YEARS AND HAEMOGLOBIN A1C >9% (75 MMOL/MOL) WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. PATIENTS RANDOMIZED TO A YOGA INTERVENTION WERE TAUGHT A 10 MINUTE SEATED YOGA PRACTICE, WERE GIVEN AN EXPLANATORY DVD AND A FOLD-OUT POCKET GUIDE TO ENCOURAGE ADHERENCE AT HOME, AND WERE INSTRUCTED TO INCORPORATE THE PRACTICE AS OFTEN AS THEY COULD. THE PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL ARM WERE PROVIDED INFORMATION AND HAND OUTS ON THE AVAILABLE YOGA CLASSES ON CAMPUS. RESULTS: AT 3 MONTH CLINICAL FOLLOW UP, THE MEAN DECREASE IN FASTING CAPILLARY BLOOD GLUCOSE (CBG) WAS 45% AMONG YOGA PARTICIPANTS (-5.2 +/- 4.1 MMOL/L). HEART RATE (HR) DROPPED BY 18% AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (BP) DROPPED BY 29% IN THE INTERVENTION ARM, (-12.4 +/- 6.69 AND -26 +/- 12.05 MMHG, RESPECTIVELY). THERE WERE NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE HAEMOGLOBIN A1C, SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE, WEIGHT, OR BODY MASS INDEX IN EITHER GROUP. CONCLUSION: OUR SMALL PILOT STUDY REINFORCES THE CURRENT MEDICAL EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE USE OF YOGA, COMBINED WITH STANDARD CARE, TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES IN DIABETES.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
10 1455  27 INFLUENCE OF TIME OF YOGA PRACTICE AND GENDER DIFFERENCES ON BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS IN TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS AND NORMAL HEALTHY ADULTS. BACKGROUND: PREVALENCE OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM) IS INCREASING WORLDWIDE. MANY STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN IMPROVING GLYCAEMIC CONTROL, WHEREAS NO STUDIES ARE AVAILABLE SHOWING THE IMPACT OF TIME OF PRACTICE ON GLUCOSE LEVELS. THE CURRENT STUDY EXPLORES THE EFFECT OF TIME OF YOGA PRACTICE ON GLUCOSE LEVELS IN COMMUNITY-DWELLING ADULTS WITH AND WITHOUT T2DM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 189 SUBJECTS WITH T2DM AND 121 SUBJECTS WITHOUT T2DM UNDERWENT A 10-DAY YOGA PROGRAM WHICH INCLUDES PRACTICAL AND THEORY LECTURE SESSIONS FOR 60MIN EVERY DAY, EITHER IN THE MORNING OR EVENING. BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION ASSESSMENTS OF FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE (FPG) WERE MEASURED ON DAY-1 AND DAY-10, RESPECTIVELY. DATA ANALYSIS WERE DONE USING STATISTICAL PACKAGE FOR THE SOCIAL SCIENCES (SPSS), VERSION 16. RESULTS: RESULTS OF THE STUDY SHOWED THAT IN INDIVIDUALS WITH T2DM, A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER REDUCTION IN FPG WAS OBSERVED WHILE PRACTICING YOGA IN THE EVENING SESSIONS THAN IN THE MORNING SESSIONS. LIKEWISE, A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN FPG WAS OBSERVED ONLY IN WOMEN WHO PRACTICED YOGA IN THE EVENING THAN IN THE MORNING, IN NON-DIABETIC HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS, WHILE THE REDUCTION WAS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IN MEN. CONCLUSION: RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT REDUCTION IN FPG LEVEL WAS BETTER WHILE PRACTICING YOGA IN EVENING THAN MORNING. SIMILARLY, WOMEN HAD A BETTER REDUCTION IN BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL THAN MEN.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
11  374  34 AYURVEDA BODY-MIND CONSTITUTIONAL TYPES AND ROLE OF YOGA INTERVENTION AMONG TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS POPULATION OF CHANDIGARH AND PANCHKULA REGIONS. BACKGROUND: TYPE 2 DIABETES NEEDS A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF ETIOLOGICAL FACTORS AND MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES BASED ON LIFESTYLE AND CONSTITUTIONAL FACTORS, GIVEN ITS HIGH ASSOCIATION RATE WITH MANY CARDIOVASCULAR, NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS, AND COVID-19 INFECTION. PURPOSE: THE PRESENT STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF DIABETES-SPECIFIC INTEGRATED YOGA LIFESTYLE PROTOCOL (DYP) ON GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND LIPID PROFILES OF DIABETIC ADULTS. ALONG WITH THE DYP INTERVENTION, THE INDIVIDUALS RESIDING IN CHANDIGARH AND PANCHKULA UNION TERRITORIES IN THE NORTHERN PART OF INDIA WERE ASSESSED FOR AYURVEDA-BASED BODY-MIND CONSTITUTIONAL TYPE. AYURVEDA DESCRIBES BODY-MIND CONSTITUTION AS "PRAKRITI," WHICH HAS BEEN DISCUSSED FROM TWO ANGLES, NAMELY PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL AS BODY AND MIND ARE CORRELATED. METHODS: CLUSTER SAMPLING OF WAITLIST CONTROL STUDY SUBJECTS WAS USED AS THE SAMPLING METHOD FOR THE STUDY. A TOTAL OF 1,215 REGISTERED SUBJECTS (81 DIABETIC) RESPONDED IN RANDOMLY SELECTED CLUSTERS IN CHANDIGARH AND PANCHKULA. AYURVEDA PHYSICIANS DID AYURVEDA BODY-MIND CONSTITUTIONAL ASSESSMENT CALLED PRAKRITI ASSESSMENT (PHYSIOLOGICAL BODY-MIND CONSTITUTION ASSESSMENT) IN 35 PARTICIPANTS (23 DIABETIC, 12 PREDIABETIC) AS A PART OF THE STUDY. RESULTS: A GROUP OF 50 SUBJECTS WAS RANDOMLY SELECTED FOR YOGA INTERVENTION OUT OF 81 DIABETES MELLITUS ADULTS, AND 31 SUBJECTS WERE ENROLLED AS WAITLIST CONTROLS. A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN LEVELS FROM 8.49 +/- 1.94% TO 7.97 +/- 2.20% IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP WAS NOTICED. THE LIPID PROFILES OF THE DYP INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS WERE MONITORED. THREE-MONTH FOLLOW-UP RESULTS OF LIPID PROFILE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS IN INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS (P < 0.05). MOST DIABETIC AND PREDIABETIC INDIVIDUALS WERE FOUND TO HAVE PITTA DOSHA (PITTA CONTROLS ALL HEAT, METABOLISM, AND TRANSFORMATION IN THE MIND AND BODY) AS DOMINANT CONSTITUTION TYPE. CONCLUSION: THE STUDY RESULTS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN DIABETIC INDIVIDUALS. THIS STUDY HAS INDICATED THE EVIDENCE FOR THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THE VALIDATED DYP FOR COMMUNITY-LEVEL INTERVENTIONS TO PREVENT MALADIES LIKE BRAIN DAMAGE AND STROKE.	2020	
                              
12  810  34 EFFECT OF YOGA ON BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS IN PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS. INTRODUCTION: IN VIEW OF PEOPLE EMBRACING SEDENTARY LIFE STYLE, AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TREATMENT BECOMING LESS, THE ROLE OF REGULAR EXERCISE ESPECIALLY 'YOGA' SEEMS TO BE A BENEFICIAL AND ECONOMICAL ADJUVANT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM). OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA ON BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS IN NORMAL AND T2DM VOLUNTEERS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE CASE-CONTROL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSIOLOGY AND DIABETIC CLINIC OF A TERTIARY CARE TEACHING HOSPITAL OVER PERIOD OF TWO YEARS. THE STUDY SUBJECTS CONSISTED OF 30 MALE DIABETIC PATIENTS ATTENDING DIABETIC CLINIC AND 30 NON-DIABETIC MALE VOLUNTEERS CONSTITUTED CONTROL GROUP. THE PATIENTS IN THE AGE GROUP OF 36 TO 55 YEARS WITH T2DM OF AT LEAST ONE YEAR DURATION AND THOSE ON DIABETIC DIET AND ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC AGENTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY GROUP. THE AGE MATCHED HEALTHY MALE VOLUNTEERS WHO HAD COME TO JOIN YOGA TRAINING AT YOGA CENTRE WERE INCLUDED IN THE CONTROL GROUP. ALL THE PARTICIPANTS WERE TRAINED BY YOGA EXPERTS AND SUBJECTED TO REGULAR PRACTICE UNDER SUPERVISION FOR SIX MONTHS. IN ALL THE PARTICIPANTS FASTING (FBS) AND POST-PRANDIAL BLOOD SUGAR (PPBS) WAS ESTIMATED BEFORE, DURING (AT THREE MONTHS) AND AFTER (SIX MONTHS) YOGA TRAINING. PAIRED STUDENT T-TEST WAS USED TO ESTIMATE DIFFERENCE IN MEANS CALCULATED BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA TRAINING IN A SAME GROUP. A P-VALUE OF <0.05 WAS CONSIDERED AS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. RESULTS: THE DISTRIBUTION OF AGE, MEAN HEIGHT AND MEAN WEIGHT AMONG BOTH THE GROUPS WERE COMPARABLE. THE REDUCTION IN MEAN VALUES OF FBS AND PPBS AT THE END OF SIX MONTHS WAS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT (P <0.001) IN BOTH THE GROUPS WHEN COMPARED WITH THE MEAN VALUES BEFORE AND DURING (THREE MONTHS) YOGA PRACTICE. THE REDUCTION IN THESE VALUES AT THREE MONTHS DURING YOGA WAS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT IN T2DM GROUP WHEN COMPARED WITH MEAN VALUES BEFORE YOGA (P <0.001), BUT IT WAS INSIGNIFICANT (P<0.05) IN CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS OF THE PRESENT STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT THE YOGA IS EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS IN PATIENTS WITH T2DM.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
13 2063  31 THE BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE COMPARED TO PHYSICAL EXERCISE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. YOGA IS INCREASINGLY USED AS AN ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE-2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM). THE PRESENT STUDY AIMS TO SYSTEMATICALLY EVALUATE THE LITERATURE AND PERFORM A META-ANALYSIS ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA PRACTICE COMPARED TO PHYSICAL EXERCISE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF T2DM. DATA WERE OBTAINED USING A STEPWISE SEARCH PROCESS USING KEYWORDS IN THE FOLLOWING ONLINE MEDICAL DATABASES; PUBMED, WEB OF SCIENCE AND SCOPUS. ALL CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS INVOLVING PATIENTS WITH T2DM, COMPARING YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION WITH PHYSICAL EXERCISE AND EVALUATING GLYCAEMIC CONTROL AND OTHER OUTCOMES BETWEEN THE INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. EIGHT STUDIES WERE ELIGIBLE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. IN TOTAL, 842 PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSIGNED TO A YOGA INTERVENTION OR A CONTROL GROUP WITH AN EXERCISE INTERVENTION AND THE AGE RANGE OF PARTICIPANTS WAS 30-78 YEARS. A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN FBG (15.16MG/DL), PPBG (28.66MG/DL), HBA1C (0.39%) AND BMI (0.71KG/M2) WAS NOTED IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP ('YOGA') COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP ('PHYSICAL EXERCISE') IN THE POOLED ANALYSIS. WE DID NOT OBSERVE ANY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS FOR LIPID PARAMETERS, OTHER BODY COMPOSITION MEASURES (WC AND WHR) AND BLOOD PRESSURE. IN CONCLUSION, OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT YOGA HAS BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON GLYCAEMIC CONTROL IN COMPARISON TO PHYSICAL EXERCISE IN T2DM HOWEVER, INDIVIDUAL STUDIES SHOWED CONSIDERABLE HETEROGENEITY. HENCE, FURTHER WELL-CONTROLLED RANDOMIZED TRIALS ARE REQUIRED PRIOR TO DRAWING CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF YOGA IN COMPARISON TO PHYSICAL EXERCISE.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
14  771  35 EFFECT OF YOGA AND AEROBICS EXERCISE ON SLEEP QUALITY IN WOMEN WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS INVESTIGATING THE EFFECT OF 12 WEEKS OF YOGA AND AEROBIC EXERCISE (RUNNING ON A TREADMILL) ON THE SLEEP QUALITY IN WOMEN WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 39 DIABETIC WOMEN WERE SELECTED FROM SEMNAN CITY WITH THE MEAN AGE OF 46.85+/-3.35 YEARS, WEIGHT OF 69.79+/-17.18 KG, HEIGHT OF 155.03+/-5.00, BMI OF 29.64+/-5.00 KG/M(2) WHO HAD A BACKGROUND OF DIABETES FOR 6.46+/-2.69 YEARS. THEY WERE THEN RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO YOGA EXERCISE (N=15), AEROBIC EXERCISE (N=13), AND CONTROL GROUP (N=11). THE EXERCISE PROGRAM WAS PERFORMED FOR 12 WEEKS, THREE SESSIONS PER EACH WEEK. IN ORDER TO MEASURE THE SLEEP QUALITY, THE PITTSBURGH SLEEP QUALITY INDEX (PSQI) WAS USED. THE DATA WERE ANALYZED BY NON-PARAMETRIC WILCOXON AND KRUSKAL-WALLIS TEST AT SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL OF P<0.05. RESULTS: OVERALL SCORE OF SLEEP QUALITY IMPROVED AFTER SIX (P=0.001) AND 12 (P=0.001) WEEKS OF YOGA EXERCISE. ALSO, SIGNIFICANT EFFECT WAS OBSERVED AFTER 6 WEEKS OF AEROBIC EXERCISE (P=0.039). HOWEVER, THE POSITIVE EFFECT WAS DIMINISHED TO UNDER SIGNIFICANT LEVELS AFTER 12 WEEKS OF AEROBIC EXERCISE (P=0.154). KRUSKAL-WALLIS TEST SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN YOGA AND AEROBIC GROUPS AFTER 12 WEEKS OF EXERCISE (P=0.002). NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED IN CONTROL GROUPS IN ALL SITUATION. CONCLUSIONS: IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT YOGA EXERCISE IS MORE EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING THE SLEEP QUALITY IN COMPARISON WITH THE SAME COURSE OF AEROBIC EXERCISE IN WOMEN SUFFERING FROM DIABETES TYPE 2. THUS, YOGA EXERCISE CAN BE SUGGESTED TO THESE PATIENTS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
15  926  32 EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA LIFESTYLE ON LIPID METABOLISM IN A VULNERABLE POPULATION-A COMMUNITY BASED MULTICENTER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: DYSLIPIDEMIA POSES A HIGH RISK FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND STROKE IN TYPE 2 DIABETES (T2DM). THERE ARE NO STUDIES ON THE IMPACT OF A VALIDATED INTEGRATED YOGA LIFESTYLE PROTOCOL ON LIPID PROFILES IN A HIGH-RISK DIABETES POPULATION. METHODS: HERE, WE REPORT THE RESULTS OF LIPID PROFILE VALUES OF 11,254 (YOGA 5932 AND CONTROL 5322) ADULTS (20-70 YEARS) OF BOTH GENDERS WITH HIGH RISK (>/=60 ON INDIAN DIABETES RISK SCORE) FOR DIABETES FROM A NATIONWIDE RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITY-BASED TWO GROUP (YOGA AND CONVENTIONAL MANAGEMENT) CLUSTER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. THE YOGA GROUP PRACTICED A VALIDATED INTEGRATED YOGA LIFESTYLE PROTOCOL (DYP) IN NINE DAY CAMPS FOLLOWED BY DAILY ONE-HOUR PRACTICE. BIOCHEMICAL PROFILING INCLUDED GLYCATED HEMOGLOBIN AND LIPID PROFILES BEFORE AND AFTER THREE MONTHS. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS (P < 0.001 ANCOVA) WITH IMPROVED SERUM TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDES, LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN, AND HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN IN THE YOGA GROUP COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. FURTHER, THE REGULATORY EFFECT OF YOGA WAS NOTED WITH A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE OR INCREASE IN THOSE WITH HIGH OR LOW VALUES OF LIPIDS, RESPECTIVELY, WITH MARGINAL OR NO CHANGE IN THOSE WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE. CONCLUSION: YOGA LIFESTYLE IMPROVES AND REGULATES (LOWERED IF HIGH, INCREASED IF LOW) THE BLOOD LIPID LEVELS IN BOTH GENDERS OF PREDIABETIC AND DIABETIC INDIVIDUALS IN BOTH RURAL AND URBAN INDIAN COMMUNITIES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
16  410  28 BLOOD LIPIDS AND ANTHROPOMETRIC PARAMETERS IN HEALTHY SUBJECTS PRACTICING YOGA OR RESISTANCE TRAINING IN LEISURE TIME. WHAT MATTERS: TYPE OR INTENSITY OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY? AIM: THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO ASSESS EFFECTS OF YOGA AND RESISTANCE TRAININGS ON BLOOD LIPIDS AND ANTHROPOMETRIC PARAMETERS IN PEOPLE WITHOUT CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY, WHICH INCLUDED 167 SUBJECTS, WAS CONDUCTED. SUBJECTS REGULARLY PRACTICING YOGA OR RESISTANCE TRAINING NOT LESS THAN 2 TIMES A WEEK FOR A PERIOD MORE THAN ONE YEAR WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. YOGA TRAININGS WERE DEFINED AS YOGA ASANAS AND RESISTANCE TRAININGS WERE DEFINED AS ANY EXERCISE THAT CAUSES THE MUSCLES TO CONTRACT AGAINST AN EXTERNAL RESISTANCE. ANTHROPOMETRIC PARAMETERS, BLOOD LIPIDS AND GLUCOSE, URIC ACID WERE ASSESSED. WE USED INTERNATIONAL QUESTIONNAIRE ON LONG PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO ASSESS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND SEDENTARY TIME. SPSS 17.0 WAS USED TO PERFORM STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. RESULTS: THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN "YOGA TRAINING" AND "RESISTANCE TRAINING" GROUPS IN GENERAL PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, MODERATE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND SITTING TIME IN THE WHOLE GROUP. HDL-CHOLESTEROL WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN "YOGA TRAINING" COMPARED TO "RESISTANCE TRAINING" GROUP AND CONTROL GROUP (1,65+/-0,37 MMOL/L; 1,43+/-0,21 MMOL/L AND 1,34+/-0,22, PYOGA-RESISTANCE TRAINING=0,001; PYOGA-CONTROL=0,0001; PRESISTANCE TRAINING-CONTROL= P2-3=0,037). LDL CHOLESTEROL WAS THE LOWEST IN SUBJECTS THAT HAD THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF VIGOROUS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. CONCLUSIONS: PEOPLE PRACTICING YOGA AND RESISTANCE TRAINING HAD MORE FAVORABLE BLOOD LIPID PROFILE AND ANTHROPOMETRIC PARAMETERS THAN CONTROL GROUP. "YOGA TRAINING" HAD MORE PRONOUNCED POSITIVE EFFECT ON HDL CHOLESTEROL. LEVEL OF LDL CHOLESTEROL WAS MORE LIKELY TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH INTENSITY OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THAN WITH TYPE OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
17  705  36 EFFECT OF INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY ON AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS IN PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY (IAYT) HAD SHOWN BENEFICIAL EFFECTS IN THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (DM). AUTONOMIC DYSFUNCTION IS ONE OF THE MAJOR COMPLICATIONS OF TYPE 2 DM. RESEARCH STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT YOGA CAN MODULATE AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS. HENCE, THE CURRENT STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF IAYT ON AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS IN TYPE 2 DIABETICS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 15 PATIENTS OF TYPE 2 DM WITH AGES RANGING FROM 35 TO 60 YEARS WERE RECRUITED FOR THE STUDY. THEY WERE DIAGNOSED WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES FROM 1-YEAR TO 15 YEARS. ASSESSMENTS WERE MADE ON DAY 1 (BEFORE YOGA) AND DAY 7 (AFTER 1-WEEK OF YOGA PRACTICE). HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV), BLOOD PRESSURE (BP) RESPONSE TO THE ISOMETRIC HANDGRIP AND HEART RATE RESPONSE TO DEEP BREATHING WERE ASSESSED BEFORE AND AFTER 1-WEEK OF IAYT. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE FROM 154.67-130.27 MG/DL (WILCOXON SIGNED RANK TEST, P = 0.029) FOLLOWING 1-WEEK OF IAYT. BP RESPONSE TO ISOMETRIC HAND GRIP IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY (WILCOXON SIGNED RANK TEST, P = 0.01). THERE WAS NO STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN HRV COMPONENTS AND HEART RATE RESPONSE TO DEEP BREATHING TEST. HOWEVER, THERE WAS A TREND OF INCREASE IN THE LOW FREQUENCY POWER (41.07%), HIGH FREQUENCY POWER (6.29%), TOTAL POWER (5.38%), AND STANDARD DEVIATION OF ALL NN INTERVALS (SDNN) (6.29%). CONCLUSION: THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT, IAYT IMPROVED AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS IN TYPE 2 DIABETES PATIENTS.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
18 1378  26 IMPACT OF INDIVIDUALIZED YOGA THERAPY ON PERCEIVED QUALITY OF LIFE PERFORMANCE ON COGNITIVE TASKS AND DEPRESSION AMONG TYPE II DIABETIC PATIENTS. CONTEXT: AN INDIVIDUALIZED APPROACH OF PROVIDING YOGA SUPPORT CAN ADDRESS MANY OF THE DISEASE-RELATED CONCERNS INDICATED IN THE MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES, SPECIFICALLY THE IMPACT ON OTHER LIFE ACTIVITIES AND LONG-TERM FUNCTIONAL WELLBEING. AIM: TO ANALYZE THE ROLE OF REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE AS A SELF-MANAGEMENT APPROACH TO ACHIEVE GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING IN TYPE II DIABETIC PATIENTS. METHODS: NINETY-ONE SUBJECTS OF BOTH SEXES RESPONDED TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT AND CONSENTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY. THIS WAS A SINGLE GROUP, BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA EVALUATION WITHOUT CONTROL COMPARISON. THE FASTING AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD SUGAR, GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN (HBA1C), COGNITIVE TASKS, DEPRESSION, COGNITIVE FAILURE, AND DIABETIC-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) WERE MEASURED AS PRETEST. THE SUBJECTS UNDERWENT ONE-TO-ONE INDIVIDUALIZED YOGA THERAPY SESSIONS, WHICH INCLUDED 12 SUPERVISED SESSIONS SPREAD OVER A 3-MONTH PERIOD. THE POSTTEST DATA WERE ANALYZED USING PAIRED T-TEST AND WILCOXON PAIRED RANK TEST. RESULTS: SHOWED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN FASTING BLOOD SUGAR. QOL OF THE DIABETIC PATIENTS HAD IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE FREQUENCY (MEAN DIFFERENCE OF 7.58, P > 0.01) OF DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND INTENSITY OF DEPRESSION (MEAN DIFFERENCE 1.66, P > 0.05). CONCENTRATION AND ATTENTION SPAN IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY AND MEAN DISCREPANCY SCORE REDUCED (MEAN DIFFERENCE 3.42, P > 0.01). THERE WERE NO MARKED CHANGES IN THE POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD SUGAR AND HBA1C. CONCLUSION: YOGA PRACTICE ENHANCES THE SUBJECTIVE WELLBEING, QOL, IMPROVES MOOD AND CONCENTRATION, AND FACILITATES ACHIEVEMENT OF ADEQUATE GLYCEMIC CONTROL AMONG TYPE II DIABETIC PATIENTS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
19  796  27 EFFECT OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON BIOCHEMICAL, OXIDATIVE STRESS MARKERS, INFLAMMATORY MARKERS AND SLEEP QUALITY AMONG SUBJECTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES IN SOUTH INDIA: RESULTS FROM THE SATYAM PROJECT. AIMS: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA INTERVENTION ON THE BIOCHEMICAL, OXIDATIVE STRESS MARKERS AND INFLAMMATORY MARKERS AND SLEEP QUALITY AMONG SUBJECTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES. METHODS: SUBJECTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES ATTENDING A TERTIARY CARE CENTRE FOR DIABETES DURING FEB 2017 TO OCT 2019 IN CHENNAI, INDIA WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS. GROUP1(NON-YOGA) (N = 150) WAS ADVISED ON SIMPLE PHYSICAL EXERCISES WHEREAS GROUP2(YOGA) (N = 150) WAS TRAINED AND ADVISED TO DO YOGASANAS WITH STATIC LOOSENING EXERCISES FOR 50 MIN FOR 5 DAYS IN A WEEK. BOTH THE GROUPS WERE FOLLOWED UP FOR A PERIOD OF 3 MONTHS. ANTHROPOMETRIC, BIOCHEMICAL, OXIDATIVE STRESS MARKERS, INFLAMMATORY MARKERS AND SLEEP QUALITY WERE ASSESSED AT BASELINE AND AFTER FOLLOW UP. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN BMI, BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS, HBA1C, LIPID LEVELS, IL6, TNFALPHA AND TBARS IN YOGA GROUP AS COMPARED TO NON-YOGA GROUP. THERE WAS MARKED IMPROVEMENT IN THE LEVELS OF ADIPONECTIN, PTGIS AND SLEEP QUALITY AMONG SUBJECTS PRACTISING YOGASANAS. CONCLUSION: REGULAR PRACTICE OF YOGASANAS IMPROVED GLYCAEMIC CONTROL, OXIDATIVE STRESS, INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE AND SLEEP QUALITY AMONG SUBJECTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES. HENCE, YOGASANAS CAN BE USED AS AN ADJUVANT THERAPY FOR MANAGING TYPE 2 DIABETES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
20 1491  28 INTERLEUKIN-6, VITAMIN D & DIABETES RISK-FACTORS MODIFIED BY A SHORT-TERM YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION IN OVERWEIGHT/OBESE INDIVIDUALS. BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: SEVERAL DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAMMES HAVE DEMONSTRATED A REDUCTION IN INCIDENCE OF DIABETES IN INDIVIDUALS WITH PREDIABETES THROUGH WEIGHT LOSS. SHORT-TERM YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION PROGRAMMES HAVE ALSO BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFICACIOUS IN WEIGHT LOSS. THIS STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO INVESTIGATE IF INTERLEUKIN (IL)-6, VITAMIN D, NEOPTERIN, VASPIN, AND DIABETES RISK FACTORS CAN BE MODIFIED BY A SHORT-TERM YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION IN OVERWEIGHT/OBESE SUBJECTS. METHODS: IN THIS PILOT STUDY, 34 OVERWEIGHT/OBESE [BODY MASS INDEX (BMI) >/= 23 TO <35 KG/M [2] PER ASIAN CUT-OFF VALUES] INDIVIDUALS WERE ENROLLED, AND RECEIVED DIRECTLY SUPERVISED INTERVENTION FOR 10 DAYS. THEREAFTER, THEY WERE ADVISED TO FOLLOW THIS YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE AT HOME FOR ONE MONTH, AND WERE REASSESSED FOR STUDY VARIABLES AT DAY 30. RESULTS: THERE WAS A REDUCTION FROM BASELINE TO DAY 10 IN WEIGHT ( P <0.001), BMI ( P <0.001), WAIST/HIP-RATIO ( P <0.05), BLOOD GLUCOSE ( P <0.01), AND A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN LIPID PROFILE. THERE WAS A DECREASE IN MEDIAN FASTING INSULIN ( P <0.05), HOMEOSTATIC MODEL ASSESSMENT-INSULIN RESISTANCE ( P <0.01), AND IL-6 ( PP <0.05). A NON-SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN 25-OH-VITAMIN D, AND A DECREASE IN NEOPTERIN AND VASPIN WERE OBSERVED. TWENTY SUBJECTS RETURNED FOR FOLLOW UP ASSESSMENTS. AT DAY 30, WEIGHT LOSS WAS SUSTAINED WHILE SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE ALSO SHOWED REDUCTION ( P <0.05). CHANGES IN VITAMIN D LEVELS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY AND NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH CHANGES IN WEIGHT, BMI AND FASTING BLOOD GLUCOSE, AND POSITIVELY WITH CHANGE IN HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN. CHANGES IN BODY WEIGHT AND BMI SIGNIFICANTLY AND POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH INSULIN. CHANGES IN IL-6 LEVELS POSITIVELY AND SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH CHANGE IN NEOPTERIN LEVELS. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: THE FINDINGS SHOWED THAT IL-6, VITAMIN D, AND DIABETES RISK FACTORS WERE FAVOURABLY MODIFIED BY A SHORT-TERM YOGA-BASED LIFESTYLE INTERVENTION IN OBESITY. THIS STUDY ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THE CHALLENGES IN COMPLIANCE ASSOCIATED WITH THE FOLLOW UP OF SUBJECTS FOLLOWING AN AGGRESSIVE SUPERVISED INTERVENTION OF 10 DAYS.	2015

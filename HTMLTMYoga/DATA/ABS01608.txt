1 1608 104 META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS ON YOGA, PSYCHOSOCIAL, AND MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE: WHAT INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS ARE RELATED TO HIGHER EFFICACY? CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (CRF) IS A BURDENSOME SEQUELA OF CANCER TREATMENTS. BESIDES EXERCISE, RECOMMENDED THERAPIES FOR CRF INCLUDE YOGA, PSYCHOSOCIAL, AND MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS. HOWEVER, INTERVENTIONS CONDUCTED VARY WIDELY, AND NOT ALL SHOW A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT. THIS META-ANALYSIS AIMED TO EXPLORE INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS RELATED TO GREATER REDUCTIONS IN CRF. WE INCLUDED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS PUBLISHED BEFORE OCTOBER 2021. STANDARDIZED MEAN DIFFERENCES WERE USED TO ASSESS INTERVENTION EFFICACY FOR CRF AND MULTIMODEL INFERENCE TO EXPLORE INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER EFFICACY. FOR THE META-ANALYSIS, WE INCLUDED 70 INTERVENTIONS (24 YOGA INTERVENTIONS, 31 PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTIONS, AND 15 MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS) WITH 6387 PARTICIPANTS. THE RESULTS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF YOGA, PSYCHOSOCIAL, AND MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS ON CRF BUT WITH HIGH HETEROGENEITY BETWEEN STUDIES. FOR YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS, NO PARTICULAR INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTIC WAS IDENTIFIED TO BE ADVANTAGEOUS FOR REDUCING CRF. REGARDING PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTIONS, A GROUP SETTING AND WORK ON COGNITION WERE RELATED TO HIGHER INTERVENTION EFFECTS ON CRF. THE RESULTS OF THIS META-ANALYSIS SUGGEST OPTIONS TO MAXIMIZE THE INTERVENTION EFFECTS OF PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTIONS FOR CRF. THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AND MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR CRF APPEAR TO BE INDEPENDENT OF THEIR DESIGN, ALTHOUGH THE LIMITED NUMBER OF STUDIES POINTS TO THE NEED FOR FURTHER RESEARCH.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
2 2383  30 YOGA & CANCER INTERVENTIONS: A REVIEW OF THE CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF PATIENT REPORTED OUTCOMES FOR CANCER SURVIVORS. LIMITED RESEARCH SUGGESTS YOGA MAY BE A VIABLE GENTLE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OPTION WITH A VARIETY OF HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, PSYCHOSOCIAL AND SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT BENEFITS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO DETERMINE THE CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES FROM YOGA INTERVENTIONS CONDUCTED WITH CANCER SURVIVORS. A TOTAL OF 25 PUBLISHED YOGA INTERVENTION STUDIES FOR CANCER SURVIVORS FROM 2004-2011 HAD PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES, INCLUDING QUALITY OF LIFE, PSYCHOSOCIAL OR SYMPTOM MEASURES. THIRTEEN OF THESE STUDIES MET THE NECESSARY CRITERIA TO ASSESS CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE FOR EACH OF THE OUTCOMES OF INTEREST WAS EXAMINED BASED ON 1 STANDARD ERROR OF THE MEASUREMENT, 0.5 STANDARD DEVIATION, AND RELATIVE COMPARATIVE EFFECT SIZES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE CONFIDENCE INTERVALS. THIS REVIEW DESCRIBES IN DETAIL THESE PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES, HOW THEY WERE OBTAINED, THEIR RELATIVE CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPLICATIONS FOR BOTH CLINICAL AND RESEARCH SETTINGS. OVERALL, CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES SUGGEST THAT YOGA INTERVENTIONS HOLD PROMISE FOR IMPROVING CANCER SURVIVORS' WELL-BEING. THIS RESEARCH OVERVIEW PROVIDES NEW DIRECTIONS FOR EXAMINING HOW CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE CAN PROVIDE A UNIQUE CONTEXT FOR DESCRIBING CHANGES IN PATIENT-REPORTED OUTCOMES FROM YOGA INTERVENTIONS. RESEARCHERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO EMPLOY INDICES OF CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE IN THE INTERPRETATION AND DISCUSSION OF RESULTS FROM YOGA STUDIES.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
3 2129  34 THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA ON CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION: THE AIM OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA ON CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE (CRF) IN PATIENTS UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY AND/OR RADIATION THERAPY. LITERATURE SEARCH: RELEVANT ENGLISH AND CHINESE ARTICLES WERE RETRIEVED FROM MEDICAL DATABASES AND INCLUDED IN THIS ANALYSIS. STANDARDIZED CRITICAL APPRAISAL INSTRUMENTS FROM THE JOANNA BRIGGS INSTITUTE WERE ADOPTED FOR THE QUALITY ASSESSMENT. DATA EVALUATION: 16 RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. SYNTHESIS: YOGA INTERVENTIONS HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT IN REDUCING CRF AMONG PATIENTS UNDERGOING CHEMOTHERAPY AND/OR RADIATION THERAPY, BUT THE ADHERENCE TO YOGA WAS LOW. MIXED TYPES OF YOGA, IN ADDITION TO SUPERVISED AND SELF-PRACTICING STRATEGIES, WERE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED PATIENT ADHERENCE AND IMPROVED CRF. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: YOGA APPEARS TO BE A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE EXERCISE FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF CRF DURING CHEMOTHERAPY AND/OR RADIATION THERAPY; HOWEVER, ADDITIONAL HIGH-QUALITY STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO DEFINE AN OPTIMAL YOGA INTERVENTION STRATEGY.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
4 1079  36 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND PHYSICAL HEALTH OF PATIENTS WITH CANCER: A META-ANALYSIS. YOGA IS ONE OF THE MOST WIDELY USED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE THERAPIES TO MANAGE ILLNESS. THIS META-ANALYSIS AIMED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND PHYSICAL HEALTH OF PATIENTS WITH CANCER. STUDIES WERE IDENTIFIED THROUGH A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH OF SEVEN ELECTRONIC DATABASES AND WERE SELECTED IF THEY USED A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL DESIGN TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN PATIENTS WITH CANCER. THE QUALITY OF EACH ARTICLE WAS RATED BY TWO OF THE AUTHORS USING THE PEDRO SCALE. TEN ARTICLES WERE SELECTED; THEIR PEDRO SCORES RANGED FROM 4 TO 7. THE YOGA GROUPS COMPARED TO WAITLIST CONTROL GROUPS OR SUPPORTIVE THERAPY GROUPS SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENTS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH: ANXIETY (P = .009), DEPRESSION (P = .002), DISTRESS (P = .003), AND STRESS (P = .006). HOWEVER, DUE TO THE MIXED AND LOW TO FAIR QUALITY AND SMALL NUMBER OF STUDIES CONDUCTED, THE FINDINGS ARE PRELIMINARY AND LIMITED AND SHOULD BE CONFIRMED THROUGH HIGHER-QUALITY, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
5 1740  38 PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL BENEFITS OF YOGA IN CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS, A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. BACKGROUND: THIS STUDY AIMED TO SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEW THE EVIDENCE FROM RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) AND TO CONDUCT A META-ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES IN CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS. METHODS: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE SEARCH IN TEN DATABASES WAS CONDUCTED IN NOVEMBER 2011. STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IF THEY HAD AN RCT DESIGN, FOCUSED ON CANCER PATIENTS OR SURVIVORS, INCLUDED PHYSICAL POSTURES IN THE YOGA PROGRAM, COMPARED YOGA WITH A NON-EXERCISE OR WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP, AND EVALUATED PHYSICAL AND/OR PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES. TWO RESEARCHERS INDEPENDENTLY RATED THE QUALITY OF THE INCLUDED RCTS, AND HIGH QUALITY WAS DEFINED AS >50% OF THE TOTAL POSSIBLE SCORE. EFFECT SIZES (COHEN'S D) WERE CALCULATED FOR OUTCOMES STUDIED IN MORE THAN THREE STUDIES AMONG PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER USING MEANS AND STANDARD DEVIATIONS OF POST-TEST SCORES OF THE INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS. RESULTS: SIXTEEN PUBLICATIONS OF 13 RCTS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA, OF WHICH ONE INCLUDED PATIENTS WITH LYMPHOMAS AND THE OTHERS FOCUSED ON PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. THE MEDIAN QUALITY SCORE WAS 67% (RANGE: 22-89%). THE INCLUDED STUDIES EVALUATED 23 PHYSICAL AND 20 PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES. OF THE OUTCOMES STUDIED IN MORE THAN THREE STUDIES AMONG PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER, WE FOUND LARGE REDUCTIONS IN DISTRESS, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION (D = -0.69 TO -0.75), MODERATE REDUCTIONS IN FATIGUE (D = -0.51), MODERATE INCREASES IN GENERAL QUALITY OF LIFE, EMOTIONAL FUNCTION AND SOCIAL FUNCTION (D = 0.33 TO 0.49), AND A SMALL INCREASE IN FUNCTIONAL WELL-BEING (D = 0.31). EFFECTS ON PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND SLEEP WERE SMALL AND NOT SIGNIFICANT. CONCLUSION: YOGA APPEARED TO BE A FEASIBLE INTERVENTION AND BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON SEVERAL PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL SYMPTOMS WERE REPORTED. IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER, EFFECT SIZE ON FUNCTIONAL WELL-BEING WAS SMALL, AND THEY WERE MODERATE TO LARGE FOR PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
6 1042  39 EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON FATIGUE IN CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. BACKGROUND: FATIGUE IS ONE OF THE MOST FREQUENTLY REPORTED, DISTRESSING SIDE EFFECTS REPORTED BY CANCER SURVIVORS AND OFTEN HAS SIGNIFICANT LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES. RESEARCH INDICATES THAT YOGA CAN PRODUCE INVIGORATING EFFECTS ON PHYSICAL AND MENTAL ENERGY, AND THEREBY MAY IMPROVE LEVELS OF FATIGUE. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS TO EXAMINE THE LITERATURE THAT REPORTS THE EFFECTS OF RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON SELF-REPORTED FATIGUE IN CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS. THE ONLINE ELECTRONIC DATABASES, PUBMED AND PSYCINFO, WERE USED TO SEARCH FOR PEER-REVIEWED RESEARCH ARTICLES STUDYING THE EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON FATIGUE IN CANCER SURVIVORS. COMBINATIONS OF YOGA, CANCER, AND FATIGUE-RELATED SEARCH TERMS WERE ENTERED SIMULTANEOUSLY TO OBTAIN ARTICLES THAT INCLUDED ALL THREE ELEMENTS. STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IF THEY MET THE FOLLOWING INCLUSION CRITERIA: PARTICIPANTS WERE MALE OR FEMALE CANCER PATIENTS OR SURVIVORS PARTICIPATING IN RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED YOGA INTERVENTIONS. THE MAIN OUTCOME OF INTEREST WAS CHANGE IN FATIGUE FROM PRE- TO POST-INTERVENTION. INTERVENTIONS OF ANY LENGTH WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. RISK OF BIAS USING THE FORMAT OF THE COCHRANE COLLABORATION'S TOOL FOR ASSESSING RISK OF BIAS WAS ALSO EXAMINED ACROSS STUDIES. RESULTS: TEN ARTICLES MET INCLUSION CRITERIA AND INVOLVED A TOTAL OF 583 PARTICIPANTS WHO WERE PREDOMINANTLY FEMALE, BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. FOUR STUDIES INDICATED THAT THE YOGA INTERVENTION RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN SELF-REPORTED FATIGUE FROM PRE- TO POST-INTERVENTION. THREE OF THE STUDIES REPORTED THAT THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS OF FATIGUE AMONG PARTICIPANTS WHO ATTENDED A GREATER NUMBER OF YOGA CLASSES. RISK OF BIAS WAS HIGH FOR AREAS OF ADEQUATE SELECTION, PERFORMANCE, DETECTION, AND PATIENT-REPORTED BIAS AND MIXED FOR ATTRITION AND REPORTING BIAS. RISK OF BIAS WAS UNIFORMLY LOW FOR OTHER FORMS OF BIAS, INCLUDING FINANCIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. CONCLUSIONS: RESULTS OF THE STUDIES INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW SUGGEST THAT YOGA INTERVENTIONS MAY BE BENEFICIAL FOR REDUCING CANCER-RELATED FATIGUE IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER; HOWEVER, CONCLUSIONS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION AS A RESULT OF LEVELS OF BIAS AND INCONSISTENT METHODS USED ACROSS STUDIES. MORE WELL-CONSTRUCTED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS ARE NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON FATIGUE IN CANCER PATIENTS AND SURVIVORS.	2013	

7 2566  37 YOGA FOR DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IN PEOPLE WITH CANCER: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVE: CANCER AND ITS TREATMENT CAN LEAD TO A VARIETY OF PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL CONCERNS IMPACTING ON THOSE AFFECTED, INCLUDING SUBCLINICAL OR CLINICAL DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY, WHICH IN TURN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON WELLBEING, QUALITY OF LIFE AND SURVIVAL. THE AIM OF THIS REVIEW WAS TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ON SELF-REPORTED DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS IN PEOPLE WITH CANCER IN RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. METHOD: SIX DATABASES WERE SEARCHED TO IDENTIFY RELEVANT STUDIES. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW PROCEDURES WERE FOLLOWED INCLUDING A QUALITY ASSESSMENT. META-ANALYSIS OF SUITABLE STUDIES WAS CONDUCTED. RESULTS: 26 STUDIES FROM OUR SEARCH CRITERIA WERE ELIGIBLE FOR INCLUSION FOR DEPRESSIVE AND 16 FOR ANXIETY SYMPTOMS. META-ANALYSES REVEALED EVIDENCE FOR SIGNIFICANT MEDIUM EFFECTS OF YOGA ON DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS (N = 1,486, G = -0.419, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI] = -0.558 TO -0.281, P < 0.001) AND ANXIETY (N = 977, G = -0.347, 95% CI = -0.473 TO -0.221, P < 0.001) COMPARED TO CONTROLS. SUBGROUP ANALYSES FOR DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS REVEALED SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS FOR ALL ANALYSES PERFORMED (TYPE OF CANCER, TYPE OF CONTROL, TREATMENT STATUS, DURATION OF INTERVENTION OR FREQUENCY OF YOGA SESSIONS), WITH EFFECT SIZES BEING COMPARABLE BETWEEN SUBGROUPS. SIMILAR FINDINGS WERE FOUND FOR ANXIETY SYMPTOMS EXCEPT FOR TREATMENT STATUS, WHERE THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECT WAS FOUND WHEN YOGA WAS DELIVERED DURING ACTIVE TREATMENT. CONCLUSIONS: THIS REVIEW PROVIDES EVIDENCE THAT IN PEOPLE WITH CANCER, YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH AMELIORATION OF DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY SYMPTOMS AND THEREFORE A PROMISING THERAPEUTIC MODALITY FOR THEIR MANAGEMENT. HOWEVER, THE POTENTIAL FOR RISK OF BIAS TOGETHER WITH CONTROL GROUP DESIGN CHALLENGES MEANS THE RESULTS SHOULD BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
8 2354  31 UTILIZING YOGA IN ONCOLOGIC PATIENTS TREATED WITH RADIOTHERAPY: REVIEW. PURPOSE: SEVERAL TRIALS ON NONCANCER POPULATION INDICATE THAT YOGA IS ASSOCIATED WITH MEANINGFUL CLINICAL EFFECTS. THIS STUDY EVALUATED THE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES OF YOGA IN ONCOLOGIC PATIENTS TREATED WITH RADIOTHERAPY. METHODS: WE FOCUSED ON A RESEARCH THROUGH COCHRANE REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL), BIOMED CENTRAL, AND MEDLINE STUDIES UP TO MAY 2017. RESULTS: YOGA WAS FOUND TO HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL BENEFIT IN CANCER PATIENTS' DISTRESS, ANXIETY, AND DEPRESSION. IT ALSO DEMONSTRATED A MODERATE IMPACT ON FATIGUE AND EMOTIONAL FUNCTION AND A SMALL AND INSIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON FUNCTIONAL WELL-BEING AND SLEEP DISTURBANCES. AS FAR AS THE EFFECTS ON PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES ARE CONCERNED, THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE. CONCLUSIONS: THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS SHOWED THAT YOGA HAS STRONG BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON ONCOLOGIC PATIENTS' QUALITY OF LIFE. RESULTS OF THE CURRENT REVIEW MUST BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION DUE TO THE RELATIVE SMALL SAMPLE SIZES OF MOST OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES, WHILE A PROSPECTIVE RANDOMIZED STUDY STANDS IN NEED FOR THE CONFIRMATION OF OUR RESULTS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
9  559  37 COULD YOGA PRACTICE IMPROVE TREATMENT-RELATED SIDE EFFECTS AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER? A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. AIM: TO DETERMINE IF YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPY WAS ASSOCIATED WITH ENHANCED HEALTH AND TREATMENT-RELATED SIDE EFFECTS IN PATIENTS WITH BREAST CANCER. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW EXAMINES WHETHER YOGA PRACTICE PROVIDES ANY MEASURABLE BENEFIT, BOTH PHYSICALLY AND PSYCHOLOGICALLY, FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER. METHODS: PUBMED, EMBASE AND THE COCHRANE LIBRARY FOR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) THROUGHOUT JUNE 2013. WE EVALUATED THE QUALITY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES BY THE COCHRANE HANDBOOK 5.2 STANDARDS AND ANALYZED THE DATA USING THE STATA SOFTWARE, VERSION 10.0. META-REGRESSION AND SUBGROUP ANALYSIS WERE ALSO PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL PREDICTORS OF OUTCOME AND TO ASSESS HETEROGENEITY. RESULTS: SIXTEEN RCTS WITH A TOTAL OF 930 PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED. COMPARING YOGA GROUPS TO CONTROL GROUPS, THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN OVERALL HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE, DEPRESSION, ANXIETY AND GASTROINTESTINAL SYMPTOMS. META-REGRESSION ANALYSES REVEALED THAT THE DURATION OF YOGA PRACTICE AND TYPE OF CONTROL GROUP PARTLY EXPLAINED THE HETEROGENEITY. SUBGROUP ANALYSES REVEALED THAT YOGA HAD A POSITIVE EFFECT ON ANXIETY ONLY WHEN IT HAD BEEN PRACTICED FOR LONGER THAN 3 MONTHS. ONLY THE WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP SHOWED AN EFFECT OF YOGA ON PHYSICAL WELL-BEING. CONCLUSION: THE CURRENT EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATES THAT YOGA PRACTICE COULD BE EFFECTIVE IN ENHANCING HEALTH AND MANAGING SOME TREATMENT-RELATED SIDE EFFECTS FOR PATIENTS RECOVERING FROM BREAST CANCER. IN FUTURE CLINICAL STUDIES, CLINICIANS SHOULD CONSIDER THE PATIENT'S WISHES ALONG WITH THE CURRENT BEST EVIDENCE OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA PRACTICE IN THEIR CLINICAL DECISION-MAKING.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
10 2488  24 YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR THE REDUCTION OF SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION IN CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW IS TO EVALUATE THE IMPLEMENTATION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR THE REDUCTION OF SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION IN YOUTH. TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, THERE ARE NO SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS TO DATE LOOKING AT THE REDUCTION OF SYMPTOMS OF BOTH ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. METHODS: NUMEROUS SCIENTIFIC DATABASES WERE SEARCHED UP TO NOVEMBER 2018 FOR EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES ASSESSING CHANGES IN SYMPTOMS OF ANXIETY AND/OR DEPRESSION IN YOUTHS FOLLOWING YOGA INTERVENTIONS. QUALITY AND LEVEL OF EVIDENCE WERE ASSESSED, AND INFORMATION WAS SYNTHESIZED ACROSS STUDIES. RESULTS: TWENTY-SEVEN STUDIES INVOLVING YOUTH WITH VARYING HEALTH STATUSES WERE REVIEWED. INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS VARIED GREATLY ACROSS STUDIES REVEALING MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT MAY IMPACT INTERVENTION EFFICACY, HOWEVER 70% OF THE STUDIES OVERALL SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS. FOR STUDIES ASSESSING ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION, 58% SHOWED REDUCTIONS IN BOTH SYMPTOMS, WHILE 25% SHOWED REDUCTIONS IN ANXIETY ONLY. ADDITIONALLY, 70% OF STUDIES ASSESSING ANXIETY ALONE SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS AND 40% OF STUDIES ONLY ASSESSING DEPRESSION SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS. CONCLUSION: THE STUDIES REVIEWED, WHILE OF WEAK TO MODERATE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY, SHOWED THAT YOGA, DEFINED BY THE PRACTICE OF POSTURES, GENERALLY LEADS TO SOME REDUCTIONS IN ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION IN YOUTH REGARDLESS OF HEALTH STATUS AND INTERVENTION CHARACTERISTICS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
11 1043  34 EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON FATIGUE: A META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND. RESEARCHERS AIMED AT SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEWING AND META-ANALYZING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR FATIGUE. METHODS. PUBMED/MEDLINE WAS SEARCHED UNTIL JANUARY 2012 FOR CONTROLLED CLINICAL STUDIES. TWO REVIEWERS INDEPENDENTLY EXTRACTED THE DATA. THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF THE STUDIES WAS ASSESSED. A META-ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED. RESULTS. NINETEEN CLINICAL STUDIES (TOTAL N = 948) WERE INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW. INVESTIGATED YOGA STYLES INCLUDED HATHA, IYENGAR, ASANAS, PATANJALI, SAHAJA, AND TIBETAN YOGA. PARTICIPANTS WERE SUFFERING FROM CANCER, MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, DIALYSIS, CHRONIC PANCREATITIS, FIBROMYALGIA, ASTHMA, OR WERE HEALTHY. YOGA HAD A SMALL POSITIVE EFFECT ON FATIGUE (SMD = 0.27, 59% CI = 0.23-0.31). SEVEN STUDIES RECEIVED 4 POINTS ON THE JADAD SCORE. THERE WERE BASELINE DIFFERENCES IN AT LEAST 5 STUDIES. CONCLUSION. OVERALL, THE EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON FATIGUE WERE ONLY SMALL, PARTICULARLY IN CANCER PATIENTS. ALTHOUGH YOGA IS GENERALLY A SAFE THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION AND EFFECTIVE TO ATTENUATE OTHER HEALTH-RELATED SYMPTOMS, THIS META-ANALYSIS WAS NOT ABLE TO DEFINE THE POWERFUL EFFECT OF YOGA ON PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM FATIGUE. TREATMENT EFFECTS OF YOGA COULD BE IMPROVED IN WELL-DESIGNED FUTURE STUDIES. ACCORDING TO THE GRADE RECOMMENDATIONS ASSESSING THE OVERALL QUALITY OF EVIDENCE, THERE IS A MODERATE EFFECT OF THE CONFIDENCE PLACED IN THE ESTIMATES OF THE EFFECTS DISCUSSED HERE.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
12 2915  30 [SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF YOGA FOR DEPRESSION AND QUALITY OF SLEEP IN THE ELDERLY]. BACKGROUND: AGING AND AGE-RELATED HEALTH PROBLEMS ARE MAJOR ISSUES OF CONCERN FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH SERVICES. YOGA IS AN EXERCISE WITH BOTH PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS ON AGING. ALTHOUGH MANY STUDIES HAVE ASSESSED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN THE ELDERLY, LITTLE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE IN THE LITERATURE TO SUPPORT EMPIRICAL CONCLUSIONS. PURPOSE: THIS REVIEW SYNTHESIZES AND CHARACTERIZES FINDINGS RELATED TO THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON DEPRESSION AND QUALITY OF SLEEP IN THE ELDERLY. METHODS: RESEARCHERS USED KEYWORDS INCLUDING YOGA, ELDERLY, AGED / OLDER ADULT, DEPRESSION, SLEEP, AND QUALITY TO SEARCH 6 ELECTRONIC DATABASES FOR RELEVANT STUDIES PUBLISHED PRIOR TO MARCH 2013. INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA WERE USED TO SCREEN IDENTIFIED STUDY ABSTRACTS. THE JADAD SCALE APPRAISED THE QUALITY OF IDENTIFIED STUDIES. RESULTS: SEVEN STUDIES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. FIVE STUDIES FOUND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN PARTICIPANT DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS AFTER DOING YOGA. THREE STUDIES FOUND SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON THE QUALITY OF SLEEP OF PARTICIPANTS AFTER 6 MONTHS OF DOING YOGA. CONCLUSION: YOGA SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS OF ELDERLY PARTICIPANTS AND IMPROVED THEIR QUALITY OF SLEEP AFTER 6 MONTHS. FINDINGS WERE SIMILAR FOR ELDERLY LIVING IN INSTITUTIONS AND IN THE COMMUNITY. HOWEVER, THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE ASSESSED STUDIES WERE WOMEN CHARACTERIZED BY A HIGH LEVEL OF SOCIAL PARTICIPATION AND PROACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN HEALTH PROMOTION ACTIVITIES. FUTURE STUDIES SHOULD BROADEN THE SCOPE OF RESEARCH TO ADDRESS DIFFERENT AGING POPULATIONS AND USE LONG-TERM COHORT OBSERVATIONS IN ORDER TO BETTER ELICIT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AND TO DEVELOP STRATEGIES TO INTRODUCE YOGA INTO DAILY ACTIVITIES.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
13  698  36 EFFECT OF HATHA YOGA ON ANXIETY: A META-ANALYSIS. OBJECTIVE: SOME EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT HATHA YOGA MIGHT BE AN EFFECTIVE PRACTICE TO REDUCE ANXIETY. TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF HATHA YOGA ON ANXIETY, WE CONDUCTED A META-ANALYSIS OF RELEVANT STUDIES EXTRACTED FROM PUBMED, PSYCINFO, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, AND MANUAL SEARCHES. METHODS: THE SEARCH IDENTIFIED 17 STUDIES (11 WAITLIST CONTROLLED TRIALS) TOTALING 501 PARTICIPANTS WHO RECEIVED HATHA YOGA AND WHO REPORTED THEIR LEVELS OF ANXIETY BEFORE AND AFTER THE PRACTICE. WE ESTIMATED THE CONTROLLED AND WITHIN-GROUP RANDOM EFFECTS OF THE PRACTICE ON ANXIETY. RESULTS: THE PRE-POST WITHIN-GROUP AND CONTROLLED EFFECT SIZES WERE, HEDGES' G = 0.44 AND HEDGES' G = 0.61, RESPECTIVELY. TREATMENT EFFICACY WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE TOTAL NUMBER OF HOURS PRACTICED. PEOPLE WITH ELEVATED LEVELS OF ANXIETY BENEFITTED THE MOST. EFFECT SIZES WERE NOT MODERATED BY STUDY YEAR, GENDER, PRESENCE OF A MEDICAL DISORDER, OR AGE. ALTHOUGH THE QUALITY OF THE STUDIES WAS RELATIVELY LOW, THE RISK OF STUDY BIAS DID NOT MODERATE THE EFFECT. CONCLUSIONS: HATHA YOGA IS A PROMISING METHOD FOR TREATING ANXIETY. HOWEVER, MORE WELL-CONTROLLED STUDIES ARE NEEDED TO COMPARE THE EFFICACY OF HATHA YOGA WITH OTHER MORE ESTABLISHED TREATMENTS AND TO UNDERSTAND ITS MECHANISM. THIS ARTICLE IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT.

14 2592  34 YOGA FOR MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA AS A TREATMENT OPTION FOR MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS. METHODS: WE SEARCHED THE LITERATURE USING 14 DATABASES FROM THEIR INCEPTION TO JULY 2008 AND INCLUDED ALL TYPES OF CLINICAL STUDIES REGARDLESS OF THEIR DESIGN. THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF ALL STUDIES WAS ASSESSED USING A MODIFIED JADAD SCORE. RESULTS: SEVEN STUDIES MET OUR INCLUSION CRITERIA. TWO RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS COMPARED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA WITH THOSE OF WALKING OR PHYSICAL EXERCISE. THE META-ANALYSIS OF THESE DATA FAILED TO SHOW SPECIFIC EFFECTS OF YOGA ON MENOPAUSAL COMPLAINTS INCLUDING PSYCHOLOGICAL, SOMATIC, AND VASOMOTOR SYMPTOMS. TWO RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS FOUND NO EFFECTS OF YOGA ON TOTAL MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS COMPARED WITH WAIT-LIST CONTROL OR NO TREATMENT. THE REMAINING STUDIES WERE EITHER NON-RANDOMIZED (N = 1) OR UNCONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS (N = 3). THEY REPORTED FAVORABLE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS. THESE DATA COLLECTIVELY SHOW THAT THE RESULTS OF RIGOROUS STUDIES OF THE EFFECTS OF YOGA FOR MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS ARE UNCONVINCING. CONCLUSION: THE EVIDENCE IS INSUFFICIENT TO SUGGEST THAT YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR MENOPAUSE. FURTHER RESEARCH IS REQUIRED TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER THERE ARE SPECIFIC BENEFITS OF YOGA FOR TREATING MENOPAUSAL SYMPTOMS.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
15 1088  26 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SYMPTOMS, PHYSICAL FUNCTION, AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES IN ADULTS WITH OSTEOARTHRITIS: A FOCUSED REVIEW. OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) IS A HIGHLY PREVALENT AND DISABLING CHRONIC CONDITION. BECAUSE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IS A KEY COMPONENT IN OA MANAGEMENT, EFFECTIVE EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS ARE NEEDED. YOGA IS AN INCREASINGLY POPULAR MULTIMODAL MIND-BODY EXERCISE THAT AIMS TO PROMOTE FLEXIBILITY, STRENGTH, ENDURANCE, AND BALANCE. ITS GENTLE APPROACH IS POTENTIALLY A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE EXERCISE OPTION FOR MANAGING OA. THE PURPOSE OF THIS FOCUSED REVIEW IS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON OA SYMPTOMS AND PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES. A COMPREHENSIVE SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED USING SEVEN ELECTRONIC DATABASES. TWELVE REPORTS MET INCLUSION CRITERIA INVOLVING A TOTAL OF 589 PARTICIPANTS WITH OA-RELATED SYMPTOMS. A VARIETY OF TYPES, FREQUENCIES, AND DURATIONS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS WERE REPORTED; HATHA AND IYENGAR YOGA WERE THE MOST COMMONLY USED TYPES. FREQUENCY OF INTERVENTION RANGED FROM ONCE A WEEK TO 6 DAYS A WEEK. DURATION OF THE INTERVENTIONS RANGED FROM 45 TO 90 MINS PER SESSION FOR 6 TO 12 WKS. YOGA INTERVENTION RESULTED IN REDUCTIONS IN PAIN, STIFFNESS, AND SWELLING, BUT RESULTS ON PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND PSYCHOSOCIAL WELL-BEING WERE INCONCLUSIVE BECAUSE OF A VARIETY OF OUTCOME MEASURES BEING USED.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
16 2609  39 YOGA FOR QUALITY OF LIFE IN INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC DISEASE: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. BACKGROUND: CHRONIC DISEASES, INCLUDING HEART DISEASE, STROKE, CANCER, AND CHRONIC PULMONARY DISEASE ARE THE LEADING CAUSES OF DEATH AND DISABILITY WORLDWIDE. COMPOUNDING SYMPTOMS AND LOSS OF FUNCTION, PEOPLE LIVING WITH CHRONIC DISEASE OFTEN EXPERIENCE REDUCED QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). VARIOUS PHYSICAL AND MENTAL PRACTICES HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO RELIEVE STRESS AND IMPROVE QOL. YOGA IS A PHYSICAL AND MENTAL PRACTICE THAT MAY BE A VIABLE APPROACH FOR IMPROVING QOL IN PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC DISEASE. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE AND SUMMARIZE THE EVIDENCE FOR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA ON QOL IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC DISEASE. DESIGN: THE STUDY DESIGN WAS A A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WITH QUALITATIVE SYNTHESIS. METHODS: WE INCLUDED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS THAT EVALUATED THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON QOL OR HEALTH-RELATED QOL (HRQOL) FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH CHRONIC DISEASE. WE INCLUDED ONLY STUDIES THAT USED AT LEAST 1 PREVIOUSLY VALIDATED MEASURE OF QOL OR HRQOL AND SPECIFIED A MINIMUM DURATION OF FOLLOW-UP OF AT LEAST 1 WK. INTERVENTIONS: WE INCLUDED BOTH MOVEMENT-BASED AND BREATH-BASED YOGA PRACTICES. STUDIES THAT INCLUDED YOGA AS PART OF A LARGER INTERVENTION PROGRAM (EG, MINDFULNESS-BASED STRESS REDUCTION TRAINING) OR STUDIES THAT DID NOT PROVIDE FINDINGS SPECIFIC TO YOGA WERE EXCLUDED. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: THE PRIMARY OUTCOME ANALYZED WAS IMPROVEMENT IN QOL AS MEASURED BY A VALIDATED QOL OR HRQOL SCALE. RESULTS: AMONG THE 1488 STUDIES THAT WERE IDENTIFIED ON INITIAL SEARCH, 7 ARTICLES MET ALL INCLUSION CRITERIA. FIVE STUDIES REPORTED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT ADVANTAGE OVER USUAL CARE ALONE FOR IMPROVEMENT OF QOL IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC DISEASE, BUT THE CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DIFFERENCES WAS CLEAR IN ONLY 1 TRIAL. WE FOUND CONSIDERABLE HETEROGENEITY AMONG THE INCLUDED STUDIES AND STUDY QUALITY WAS GENERALLY LOW. CONCLUSIONS: MORE HIGH-QUALITY RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE THE VALUE OF YOGA AS AN ADJUNCTIVE APPROACH TO IMPROVING QOL IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC DISEASE.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
17  309  38 AN EVIDENCE-BASED REVIEW OF YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY INTERVENTION FOR PATIENTS WITH CANCER. OBJECTIVE: TO CONDUCT AN EVIDENCE-BASED REVIEW OF YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION FOR PATIENTS WITH CANCER. SPECIFICALLY, THIS PAPER REVIEWED THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON PSYCHOLOGICAL ADJUSTMENT AMONG CANCER PATIENTS. METHODS: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE SEARCH WAS CONDUCTED BETWEEN MAY 2007 AND APRIL 2008. DATA FROM EACH IDENTIFIED STUDY WERE EXTRACTED BY TWO INDEPENDENT RATERS; STUDIES WERE INCLUDED IF THEY ASSESSED PSYCHOLOGICAL FUNCTIONING AND FOCUSED ON YOGA AS A MAIN INTERVENTION. USING A QUALITY RATING SCALE (RANGE = 9-45), THE RATERS ASSESSED THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF THE STUDIES, AND CONSORT GUIDELINES WERE USED TO ASSESS RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS). EFFECT SIZES WERE CALCULATED WHEN POSSIBLE. IN ADDITION, EACH STUDY WAS NARRATIVELY REVIEWED WITH ATTENTION TO OUTCOME VARIABLES, THE TYPE OF YOGA INTERVENTION EMPLOYED, AND METHODOLOGICAL STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS. RESULTS: TEN STUDIES WERE INCLUDED, INCLUDING SIX RCTS. ACROSS STUDIES, THE MAJORITY OF PARTICIPANTS WERE WOMEN, AND BREAST CANCER WAS THE MOST COMMON DIAGNOSIS. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY RANGED GREATLY ACROSS STUDIES (RANGE = 15.5-42), WITH THE AVERAGE RATING (M = 33.55) INDICATING ADEQUATE QUALITY. STUDIES ALSO VARIED IN TERMS OF CANCER POPULATIONS AND YOGA INTERVENTIONS SAMPLED. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY PROVIDED A SYSTEMATIC EVALUATION OF THE YOGA AND CANCER LITERATURE. ALTHOUGH SOME POSITIVE RESULTS WERE NOTED, VARIABILITY ACROSS STUDIES AND METHODOLOGICAL DRAWBACKS LIMIT THE EXTENT TO WHICH YOGA CAN BE DEEMED EFFECTIVE FOR MANAGING CANCER-RELATED SYMPTOMS. HOWEVER, FURTHER RESEARCH IN THIS AREA IS CERTAINLY WARRANTED. FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD EXAMINE WHAT COMPONENTS OF YOGA ARE MOST BENEFICIAL, AND WHAT TYPES OF PATIENTS RECEIVE THE GREATEST BENEFIT FROM YOGA INTERVENTIONS.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
18 1084  32 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS MANAGEMENT IN HEALTHY ADULTS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVE: THIS ARTICLE REPORTS A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND CRITICAL APPRAISAL OF THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON STRESS MANAGEMENT IN HEALTHY ADULTS. METHODS: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE SEARCH WAS PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) AND CLINICAL CONTROLLED TRIALS (CCTS) THAT ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS MANAGEMENT IN HEALTHY ADULTS. SELECTED STUDIES WERE CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE TYPES OF INTERVENTION, DURATION, OUTCOME MEASURES, AND RESULTS. THEY WERE ALSO QUALITATIVELY ASSESSED BASED ON PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH, EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS. RESULTS: THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS BASED ON EIGHT RCTS AND CCTS THAT INDICATED A POSITIVE EFFECT OF YOGA IN REDUCING STRESS LEVELS OR STRESS SYMPTOMS. HOWEVER, MOST OF THE STUDIES HAD METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS IN THAT THE INTERVENTION DURATION WAS SHORT AND LIMITED FOLLOW-UP DATA WAS AVAILABLE. CONCLUSION: THIS REVIEW REVEALED POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON STRESS REDUCTION IN HEALTHY ADULT POPULATIONS. HOWEVER, THE RESULT SHOULD BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION DUE TO THE SMALL NUMBER OF STUDIES AND THE ASSOCIATED METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS. FURTHER STUDIES TO ASCERTAIN YOGA'S LONG-TERM EFFECTS AND THE UNDERLYING BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS LEADING TO ITS STRESS REDUCTION EFFECT SHOULD BE CONDUCTED.	2011

INCREASINGLY, YOGA HAS BECOME A POPULAR APPROACH TO IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) OF WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER. HOWEVER, THE EXTANT SYNTHETIC EVIDENCE ON YOGA HAS NOT USED OTHER EXERCISE COMPARISON CONDITIONS. THIS META-ANALYSIS AIMED TO SYSTEMATICALLY ASSESS YOGA-SPECIFIC EFFECTS RELATIVE TO ANY OTHER PHYSICAL EXERCISE INTERVENTION (EG, AEROBICS) FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER. QOL WAS THE PRIMARY OUTCOME OF INTEREST. EIGHT RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS WITH 545 PARTICIPANTS WERE INCLUDED. THE SAMPLE-WEIGHTED SYNTHESIS AT IMMEDIATE POSTINTERVENTION REVEALED MARGINALLY STATISTICALLY AND MODEST PRACTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES SUGGESTING YOGA'S POTENTIALLY GREATER EFFECTIVENESS: D = 0.14, P = .10. HOWEVER, AT LONGER TERM FOLLOW-UP, NO STATISTICALLY OR PRACTICALLY SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN-GROUP DIFFERENCE WAS OBSERVED. THIS META-ANALYSIS PRELIMINARILY DEMONSTRATED THAT YOGA IS PROBABLY AS EFFECTIVE AS OTHER EXERCISE MODALITIES IN IMPROVING THE QOL OF WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER. BOTH INTERVENTIONS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH CLINICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN QOL. NEARLY ALL OF THE YOGA INTERVENTION PROGRAMS, HOWEVER, WERE VERY POORLY RESOURCED. LARGER AND BETTER CONTROLLED TRIALS OF WELL-ENDOWED YOGA PROGRAMS ARE NEEDED.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
20 2200  27 THE EFFICACY OF YOGA AS A FORM OF TREATMENT FOR DEPRESSION. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE WAS TO SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEW YOGA INTERVENTIONS AIMED AT IMPROVING DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS. A TOTAL OF 23 INTERVENTIONS PUBLISHED BETWEEN 2011 AND MAY 2016 WERE EVALUATED IN THIS REVIEW. THREE STUDY DESIGNS WERE USED: RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS, QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL, AND PRETEST/POSTTEST, WITH MAJORITY BEING RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS. MOST OF THE STUDIES WERE IN THE UNITED STATES. VARIOUS YOGA SCHOOLS WERE USED, WITH THE MOST COMMON BEING HATHA YOGA. THE NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS PARTICIPATING IN THE STUDIES RANGED FROM 14 TO 136, IMPLYING THAT MOST STUDIES HAD A SMALL SAMPLE. THE DURATION OF THE INTERVENTION PERIOD VARIED GREATLY, WITH THE MAJORITY BEING 6 WEEKS OR LONGER. LIMITATIONS OF THE INTERVENTIONS INVOLVED THE SMALL SAMPLE SIZES USED BY THE MAJORITY OF THE STUDIES, MOST STUDIES EXAMINING THE SHORT-TERM EFFECT OF YOGA FOR DEPRESSION, AND THE NONUTILIZATION OF BEHAVIORAL THEORIES. DESPITE THE LIMITATIONS, IT CAN BE CONCLUDED THAT THE YOGA INTERVENTIONS WERE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING DEPRESSION.	2017

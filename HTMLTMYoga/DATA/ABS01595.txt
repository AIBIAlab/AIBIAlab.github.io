1 1595 120 MEDITATION AND YOGA-ASSISTED ALTERATION OF DIETARY BEHAVIOR AS A USEFUL STRATEGY FOR LIMITING ZOONOTIC PANDEMICS: A NOVEL INSIGHT. VEGETARIAN DIETS ARE KNOWN TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECTS ON PERSONAL AND PLANETARY HEALTH AND ARE LIKELY TO CURB ZOONOTIC INFECTION TRANSMISSION. WE PROPOSE THAT MINIMIZING MEAT CONSUMPTION SHOULD BECOME AN ESSENTIAL DIETARY SHIFT IN THE POST-COVID-19 ERA. TO DATE, HOWEVER, THERE IS LIMITED KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING SUITABLE METHODS THAT COULD CATALYZE THIS CHANGE ON A GLOBAL SCALE. MEDITATION AND YOGA ARE PRACTICAL AND EASY TO IMPLEMENT PSYCHOMODULATORY STRATEGIES THAT CAN NATURALLY TRIGGER VEGETARIANISM AND RELATED EATING BEHAVIORS, LOWERING OUR RELIANCE ON ANIMAL MEAT. DECREASING DEPENDENCE ON ANIMAL MEAT REDUCES THE NEED FOR ANIMAL MARKETS AND MAY SUBSTANTIALLY MINIMIZE THE LIKELIHOOD OF SPILLOVER (PASSAGE OF VIRUSES FROM ANIMAL RESERVOIRS INTO HUMAN POPULATIONS). GLOBAL IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE STRATEGIES, IN OUR OPINION, CAN ADD TO SPIRITUAL WISDOM, COMPASSION, AND COOPERATIVE HUMAN BEHAVIOR, THUS REDUCING THE ENCROACHMENT OF WILD-LIFE RESERVES AND ANIMAL EXPLOITATION. THE APPLICATION OF THESE ANCIENT INDIAN APPROACHES REPRESENTS A NOVEL AND FOCUSED STRATEGY TOWARD CURBING ZOONOTIC PANDEMICS.

IN THIS ARTICLE I FOCUS ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CONCEPTS OF SELF AND HEALTH IN MODERN NORTH INDIA. DRAWING ON FIELD RESEARCH IN A POPULAR YOGA SOCIETY, I ARGUE THAT YOGA THERAPY, AS PRACTICED BY THE BHARATIYA YOG SANSTHAN OF DELHI, PROVIDES A RECONCEPTUALIZATION OF WHAT CAN BE MEANT BY PUBLIC HEALTH. USING STUDIES THAT CHALLENGE BOTH THE ESSENTIALIST AND EPISTEMOLOGICAL FACTICITY OF THE SELF, I SHOW HOW THE DISCOURSE AND PRACTICE OF YOGA IS IMPLICATED IN, AND DERIVED FROM, A COMPLEX SEARCH FOR SELF DEFINITION IN TERMS OF HEALTH; HEALTH WHICH IS CONCEIVED OF AS A PUBLIC REGIMEN THAT SEEKS TO RECONNECT THAT WHICH MODERNITY HAS BROKEN APART: MIND AND BODY.	1997

7 1475  14 INTEGRATED APPROACH TO YOGA. YOGA IS A SCIENCE OF HOLISTIC LIVING AND NOT MERELY A SET OF ASANAS AND PRANAYAMA. IT IS A PSYCHO PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL SCIENCE, WHICH AIMS AT THE HARMONIOUS DEVELOPMENT OF THE HUMAN BODY, MIND AND SOUL. YOGA IS THE CONSCIOUS ART OF SELF-DISCOVERY. IT IS A PROCESS BY WHICH ANIMAL MAN ASCENDS THROUGH THE STAGES FROM NORMAL MAN TO SUPER MAN AND THEN THE DIVINE MAN. IT IS AN EXPANSION OF THE NARROW CONSTRICTED EGOISTIC PERSONALITY TO AN ALL-PERVASIVE ETERNAL AND BLISSFUL STATE OF REALITY. YOGA IS AN ALL ROUND DEVELOPMENT OF PERSONALITY AT PHYSICAL, MENTAL INTELLECTUAL, EMOTIONAL AND SPIRITUAL LEVEL.	2000

THIS ARTICLE IS DEVOTED TO THE ANALYSIS OF PHYSIOPHILOSOPHICAL FUNDAMENTALS AND GENESIS OF TSIGUN, INDIAN, AND TIBETAN YOGA BASED ON THE OVERVIEW OF THE RELEVANT LITERATURE WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THE METHODOLOGY OF THESE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL DISCIPLINES AND THEIR THERAPEUTIC AND HEALTH-GIVING EFFICACY. BASED ON THE COMBINATION OF PHYSIOPHILOSOPHICAL CATEGORIES AND MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE IN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE CONCEPT OF THE FIVE PRIMARY ELEMENTS, THE AUTHORS ILLUSTRATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEMIC APPROACH BY WHICH ANCIENT PHYSICIANS RELATED MAN TO NATURE IN ORDER TO DERIVE THE ADAPTATION PRINCIPLE REALIZED THROUGH HUMAN ACTIVITIES. TRADITIONAL AND MODERN ASPECTS OF THESE ACTIVITIES ARE CONSIDERED. IN THE TRADITIONAL CONTEXT, THE PERFORMANCE OF EXERCISES AS ASSIGNED BY TSIGUN, INDIAN, AND TIBETAN YOGA IS CONSIDERED AS THE PURPOSEFUL REALIZATION OF THE ENERGY OF CONSCIENCE FOR HEALTH IMPROVEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT AND IN THE MODERN CONTEXT AS THE REALIZATION OF A NOVEL FORM OF PSYCHIC CREATIVE CAPACITY TO THE SAME EFFECT BASED ON FRUITFUL BRAINWORK.	2011

10 2887  26 YOGA: CAN IT BE INTEGRATED WITH TREATMENT OF NEUROPATHIC PAIN? BACKGROUND: NEUROPATHIC PAIN (NP) IS A DEBILITATING CONDITION THAT MAY RESULT FROM SPINAL CORD INJURY (SCI). NEARLY 75% OF ALL SCI RESULTS IN NP AFFECTING 17,000 NEW INDIVIDUALS IN THE UNITED STATES EVERY YEAR, AND AN ESTIMATED 7-10% OF PEOPLE WORLDWIDE. IT IS CAUSED BY DAMAGED OR DYSFUNCTIONAL NERVE FIBERS SENDING ABERRANT SIGNALS TO PAIN CENTERS IN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM CAUSING SEVERE PAIN THAT AFFECTS DAILY LIFE AND ROUTINE. THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING NP ARE NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD, MAKING TREATMENT DIFFICULT. IDENTIFICATION OF SPECIFIC MOLECULAR PATHWAYS THAT ARE INVOLVED IN PAIN SYNDROMES AND FINDING EFFECTIVE TREATMENTS HAS BECOME A MAJOR PRIORITY IN CURRENT SCI RESEARCH. YOGA HAS THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS MAY PROVE BENEFICIAL IN TREATING SUBJECTS SUFFERING CHRONICALLY WITH SCI INDUCED NP, CHRONIC BACK AND ASSOCIATED PAINS IF NECESSARY EXPERIMENTAL DATA IS GENERATED. SUMMARY: THIS REVIEW AIMS TO DISCUSS THE IMPLICATIONS OF VARIOUS MECHANISTIC APPROACHES OF YOGA WHICH CAN BE TESTED BY NEW STUDY DESIGNS AROUND VARIOUS NOCICEPTIVE MOLECULES INCLUDING MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASES (MMPS), CATION-DEPENDENT CHLORIDE TRANSPORTER (NKCC1) ETC IN SCI INDUCED NP PATIENTS. KEY MESSAGES: THUS, YOGIC PRACTICES COULD BE USED IN MANAGING SCI INDUCED NP PAIN BY REGULATING THE ACTION OF VARIOUS MECHANISMS AND ITS ASSOCIATED MOLECULES. MODERN PRESCRIPTIVE TREATMENT STRATEGIES COMBINED WITH ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES LIKE YOGA SHOULD BE USED IN REHABILITATION CENTERS AND CLINICS IN ORDER TO AMELIORATE CHRONIC NP. WE RECOMMEND PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS OF CAREFUL YOGA PRACTICE AS PART OF AN INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE APPROACH FOR NP ASSOCIATED WITH SCI.	2019

13 2913  16 [RELATION BETWEEN YOGA AND PSYCHOTHERAPY]. WESTERN PSYCHOTHERAPY AND YOGA OVERLAP INSOFAR AS BOTH SYSTEMS ARE BASED UPON RELIGIOUS AND MYTHOLOGICAL FACTS, AND--ON THE LEVEL OF PSYCHOTHERAPEUTICAL PRAXIS--ON THE TECHNICS OF HYPNOSIS, AUTO- AND HETEROSUGGESTIONS AND/OR MEDITATION. IT IS 50 YEARS AGO THAT THE WEST CONSIDERED THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTICAL EFFECTS OF THEAYOGA-SYSTEMS, FIRST OF ALL OF HATHA- YOGA. EVEN TODAY A THEORETICAL FOUNDATION BY MEANS OF PROPER COMPARISON OF THE TWO STRUCTURES IS MISSING. IN PRESENT-DAY INDIA YOGA FULFILLS PSYCHOHYGIENICAL FUNCTIONS WITHOUT BEING A PSYCHOTHERAPY IN OUR SENSE. THERE ARE VARIOUS TECHNIQUES OF MAGIC IN USE, WHICH REPLACE THE EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGICAL-PSYCHOTHERAPEUTICAL METHODS IN THE WEST. THE ACCEPTANCE OF MEDITATION COULD ONLY BE SUCCESSFUL IF THE METAPHYSICAL AND SOCIOCULTURAL CONTEXT WOULD BE INTEGRATED AT THE SAME TIME. THE TRADITIONAL FUNCTION OF YOGA GUARANTEES ITS CONTINUITY EVEN IN THE MODERN INDUSTRIALIZED SOCIETY OF INDIA. NEITHER THE THEORETICAL NOR THE PRATICAL FUNDAMENTS ALLOW A DIRECT TRANSFER AT PRESENT.	1980

NOW IS THE TIME TO EVALUATE THE PLACE OF NUTRITION IN YOGA AND TO STUDY HOW THE DIETETIC PRINCIPLES IN YOGA WILL HELP TO ERADICATE THE NATIONAL PROBLEM OF MAL-NUTRITION AND POVERTY WHICH IS THE PRESSING NEED OF THE MOMENT.	1990	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
16 1735  23 PHENOMENOLOGICAL INQUIRY INTO PHOENIX RISING YOGA THERAPY. THERE IS GROWING RECOGNITION WITHIN PSYCHOLOGY AND OTHER DISCIPLINES THAT BODY EXPERIENCE MAY BE AS IMPORTANT AS COGNITIVE AND EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE. HOWEVER, PSYCHOLOGY HAS FEW PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS TO SUPPORT THE INTEGRATION OF MIND AND BODY WITHIN THERAPY. PHOENIX RISING YOGA THERAPY (PRYT) IS A FORM OF MIND-BODY THERAPY THAT USES YOGA POSTURE, TOUCH, AND PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC DIALOGUE TO FACILITATE GROWTH AND HEALING. THE CURRENT STUDY EXPLORED THE PHENOMENOLOGICAL EXPERIENCE OF FOUR WOMEN WHO EACH RECEIVED FIVE PRYT SESSIONS. RESEARCH QUESTIONS POSED WERE: (1) WHAT ARE THE CLIENTS' EXPERIENCES OF THE PHENOMENA OF PRYT? AND (2) HOW DOES RECEIVING PRYT SESSIONS IMPACT THE CLIENTS' LIVES? THE FOLLOWING THEMES EMERGED FROM THE DATA AS THE ESSENCE OF PRYT SESSIONS: MINDFULNESS, SELF-AWARENESS, MIND-BODY CONNECTION, IN VIVO EXPERIENCE OF NEW BEHAVIORS, CLIENT-DIRECTED, EMPOWERMENT, AND LIFE CHANGES. THESE THEMES SHOW SIGNIFICANCE IN THE MIND-BODY CONNECTION AND THAT IT IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE MODALITIES SUCH AS PRYT FOR CLIENTS. EACH PARTICIPANT NOTED GREATER INSIGHT INTO MIND-BODY CONNECTION. THEY NOTICED THE EFFECT OF COGNITION AND EMOTION ON THE BODY, OBSERVED HOW THE BODY CAN BE USED TO IMPROVE COPING THROUGH MOVEMENT AND BREATHING, AND EXPERIENCED DIFFERENT THOUGHTS AND EMOTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENT AREAS OF THEIR BODIES. ALTHOUGH THESE RESULTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY GENERALIZABLE, THEY OFFER INTERESTING THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR EMBODIED INTERVENTIONS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                       
17 2396  16 YOGA AND CHEMOREFLEX RESPONSE TO HYPOXIA AND HYPERCAPNIA. WE TESTED WHETHER CHEMOREFLEX SENSITIVITY COULD BE AFFECTED BY THE PRACTICE OF YOGA, AND WHETHER THIS IS SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE OF A SLOW BREATHING RATE OBTAINED DURING YOGA OR AS A GENERAL CONSEQUENCE OF YOGA. WE FOUND THAT SLOW BREATHING RATE PER SE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED CHEMOREFLEX SENSITIVITY, BUT LONG-TERM YOGA PRACTICE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR A GENERALISED REDUCTION IN CHEMOREFLEX.	2000	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
18 1594  25 MEDITATION AND YOGA PRACTICES AS POTENTIAL ADJUNCTIVE TREATMENT OF SARS-COV-2 INFECTION AND COVID-19: A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF KEY SUBJECTS. EDITOR'S NOTE: AS AN ACUTE CONDITION QUICKLY ASSOCIATED WITH MULTIPLE CHRONIC SUSCEPTIBILITIES, COVID-19 HAS REKINDLED INTEREST IN, AND CONTROVERSY ABOUT, THE POTENTIAL ROLE OF THE HOST IN DISEASE PROCESSES. WHILE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF RESEARCH DOLLARS HAVE BEEN FUNNELED INTO DRUG AND VACCINE SOLUTIONS THAT TARGET THE EXTERNAL AGENT, INTEGRATIVE PRACTITIONERS TUNED TO ENHANCING IMMUNITY FACED A FAMILIAR MOSTLY UNFUNDED TASK. FIRST, GO TO SCHOOL ON THE VIRUS. THEN DRAW FROM THE GLOBAL ARRAY OF NATURAL THERAPIES AND PRACTICES WITH HOST-ENHANCING OR ANTI-VIRAL CAPABILITIES TO SUGGEST INTEGRATIVE TREATMENT STRATEGIES. THE NEAR NULL-SET OF CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT OPTIONS PROPELS THIS INVESTIGATION. IN THIS PAPER, RESEARCHERS FROM THE MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-SAN DIEGO, CHOPRA LIBRARY FOR INTEGRATIVE STUDIES, AND HARVARD UNIVERSITY SHARE ONE SUCH EXPLORATION. THEIR CONCLUSION, THAT "CERTAIN MEDITATION, YOGA ASANA (POSTURES), AND PRANAYAMA (BREATHING) PRACTICES MAY POSSIBLY BE EFFECTIVE ADJUNCTIVE MEANS OF TREATING AND/OR PREVENTING SARS-COV-2 INFECTION" UNDERSCORES THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS REKINDLING. AT JACM, WE ARE PLEASED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUBLISH THIS WORK. WE HOPE THAT IT MIGHT HELP DIMINISH IN MEDICINE AND HEALTH THE POLARIZATION THAT, LIKE SO MUCH IN THE BROADER CULTURE, SEEMS TO BE AN OBSTACLE TO HEALING. -JOHN WEEKS, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, JACM.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                       
19  397  15 BEYOND CORRECT POSTURES AND FLEXIBLE BODIES: EXPLORING THE RELEVANCE OF YOGA IN END-OF-LIFE CARE. SINCE THE MID-TWENTIETH CENTURY, YOGA HAS EMERGED AS A MULTI-MILLION US DOLLAR GLOBAL FITNESS INDUSTRY. IT HAS DRAWN WORLDWIDE FOLLOWERS TO PRACTICE POSTURAL AND BREATHING TECHNIQUES. HOWEVER, THE FITNESS MODEL ONLY ELUCIDATES HOW TO LIVE WELL AND NOT HOW TO DIE WELL. THIS ARTICLE CONTENDS THAT THE BODY-CENTRIC APPROACH HAS LITTLE RELEVANCE TO THOSE WHO ARE DYING. IT ESPOUSES THAT YOGIC VALUES LIKE TRANSCENDENCE, HOLISTIC HEALING, HARMONY, AND DEATH-ACCEPTANCE THAT QUALIFY A 'GOOD' DEATH ARE REGRETTABLY LOST IN MODERN TIMES. IN CONCLUSION, THE SOTERIOLOGICAL AIM NEEDS TO BE RETAINED IN THE MODERN YOGIC DISCOURSE TO LIVE WELL AND DIE GRACEFULLY.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
20 1310  21 HEALING MYTHS, YOGA STYLES AND SOCIAL BODIES: SOCIO-LOGICS OF YOGA AS A HEALTH PRACTICE IN THE SOCIALLY STRATIFIED CITY OF MARSEILLE, FRANCE. DRAWING ON PARTICIPANT OBSERVATION AND INTERVIEWS IN TWO YOGA STUDIOS IN THE HIGHLY SOCIALLY STRATIFIED CITY OF MARSEILLE, FRANCE, THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE UNDERSTANDINGS OF YOGA AS A HEALTH PRACTICE THAT EMERGE AT THE INTERSECTIONS BETWEEN YOGA STYLES AND THEIR SOCIAL CONTEXTS OF CONSUMPTION. ITS INSIGHTS EMERGE FROM THE COMPARISON OF THREE MODERN YOGA STYLES THAT WERE DEVELOPED FOR WESTERN ENGLISH-SPEAKING CULTURAL CONTEXTS - IYENGAR, BIKRAM AND FORREST - AND WHICH DIFFER IN FORM BUT ALSO IN THE CHRONOLOGY OF THEIR EMERGENCE ON THE GLOBAL YOGA MARKET AND THAT OF THEIR RECEPTION IN FRANCE. THESE THREE YOGA STYLES ARE ALSO BRANDED THROUGH CONTRASTING MYTHOLOGIES OF TRANSFORMATIONAL HEALING, AND THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXPLORE HOW A BRAND CONCEPTUALIZATION OF YOGA AS A HEALTH PRACTICE RELATES TO OR RESONATES WITH THE EMBODIED EXPERIENCES OF PRACTITIONERS, AND TO THE SOCIO-CULTURAL CONTEXTS IN WHICH PRACTITIONERS AND THEIR PRACTICES ARE EMBEDDED. THE PAPER CONTRIBUTES A NEW CASE STUDY TO THE GLOBAL YOGA SCHOLARSHIP AND TO A POORLY STUDIED FRENCH YOGA SCENE, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, IT CROSS-EXAMINES THE DISCOURSES THROUGH WHICH A YOGA STYLE IS BRANDED, THE WAY IT IS TRANSMITTED, AND THE SOCIAL CONTEXT AND SOCIAL POSITIONING OF THE INDIVIDUALS WHO PRACTICE IT. COMBINING PERSPECTIVES ON THE BODY, NARRATIVE AND RITUALS, IT IDENTIFIES HOW YOGA HEALING IS CONSTRUED IN RELATION TO GENDER, ETHNICITY AND CLASS AND THE POINTS OF CONSENSUS AND DISSENT THAT EMERGE FROM THE ENCOUNTERS BETWEEN FRENCH SOCIAL BODIES AND EXOGENOUS YOGA STYLES.	2021

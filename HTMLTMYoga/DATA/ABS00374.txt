1  374 170 AYURVEDA BODY-MIND CONSTITUTIONAL TYPES AND ROLE OF YOGA INTERVENTION AMONG TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS POPULATION OF CHANDIGARH AND PANCHKULA REGIONS. BACKGROUND: TYPE 2 DIABETES NEEDS A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF ETIOLOGICAL FACTORS AND MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES BASED ON LIFESTYLE AND CONSTITUTIONAL FACTORS, GIVEN ITS HIGH ASSOCIATION RATE WITH MANY CARDIOVASCULAR, NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS, AND COVID-19 INFECTION. PURPOSE: THE PRESENT STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF DIABETES-SPECIFIC INTEGRATED YOGA LIFESTYLE PROTOCOL (DYP) ON GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND LIPID PROFILES OF DIABETIC ADULTS. ALONG WITH THE DYP INTERVENTION, THE INDIVIDUALS RESIDING IN CHANDIGARH AND PANCHKULA UNION TERRITORIES IN THE NORTHERN PART OF INDIA WERE ASSESSED FOR AYURVEDA-BASED BODY-MIND CONSTITUTIONAL TYPE. AYURVEDA DESCRIBES BODY-MIND CONSTITUTION AS "PRAKRITI," WHICH HAS BEEN DISCUSSED FROM TWO ANGLES, NAMELY PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL AS BODY AND MIND ARE CORRELATED. METHODS: CLUSTER SAMPLING OF WAITLIST CONTROL STUDY SUBJECTS WAS USED AS THE SAMPLING METHOD FOR THE STUDY. A TOTAL OF 1,215 REGISTERED SUBJECTS (81 DIABETIC) RESPONDED IN RANDOMLY SELECTED CLUSTERS IN CHANDIGARH AND PANCHKULA. AYURVEDA PHYSICIANS DID AYURVEDA BODY-MIND CONSTITUTIONAL ASSESSMENT CALLED PRAKRITI ASSESSMENT (PHYSIOLOGICAL BODY-MIND CONSTITUTION ASSESSMENT) IN 35 PARTICIPANTS (23 DIABETIC, 12 PREDIABETIC) AS A PART OF THE STUDY. RESULTS: A GROUP OF 50 SUBJECTS WAS RANDOMLY SELECTED FOR YOGA INTERVENTION OUT OF 81 DIABETES MELLITUS ADULTS, AND 31 SUBJECTS WERE ENROLLED AS WAITLIST CONTROLS. A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN LEVELS FROM 8.49 +/- 1.94% TO 7.97 +/- 2.20% IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP WAS NOTICED. THE LIPID PROFILES OF THE DYP INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS WERE MONITORED. THREE-MONTH FOLLOW-UP RESULTS OF LIPID PROFILE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS IN INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS (P < 0.05). MOST DIABETIC AND PREDIABETIC INDIVIDUALS WERE FOUND TO HAVE PITTA DOSHA (PITTA CONTROLS ALL HEAT, METABOLISM, AND TRANSFORMATION IN THE MIND AND BODY) AS DOMINANT CONSTITUTION TYPE. CONCLUSION: THE STUDY RESULTS DEMONSTRATED SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA IN DIABETIC INDIVIDUALS. THIS STUDY HAS INDICATED THE EVIDENCE FOR THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THE VALIDATED DYP FOR COMMUNITY-LEVEL INTERVENTIONS TO PREVENT MALADIES LIKE BRAIN DAMAGE AND STROKE.	2020	
                               
2  926  54 EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA LIFESTYLE ON LIPID METABOLISM IN A VULNERABLE POPULATION-A COMMUNITY BASED MULTICENTER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. BACKGROUND: DYSLIPIDEMIA POSES A HIGH RISK FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND STROKE IN TYPE 2 DIABETES (T2DM). THERE ARE NO STUDIES ON THE IMPACT OF A VALIDATED INTEGRATED YOGA LIFESTYLE PROTOCOL ON LIPID PROFILES IN A HIGH-RISK DIABETES POPULATION. METHODS: HERE, WE REPORT THE RESULTS OF LIPID PROFILE VALUES OF 11,254 (YOGA 5932 AND CONTROL 5322) ADULTS (20-70 YEARS) OF BOTH GENDERS WITH HIGH RISK (>/=60 ON INDIAN DIABETES RISK SCORE) FOR DIABETES FROM A NATIONWIDE RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITY-BASED TWO GROUP (YOGA AND CONVENTIONAL MANAGEMENT) CLUSTER RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. THE YOGA GROUP PRACTICED A VALIDATED INTEGRATED YOGA LIFESTYLE PROTOCOL (DYP) IN NINE DAY CAMPS FOLLOWED BY DAILY ONE-HOUR PRACTICE. BIOCHEMICAL PROFILING INCLUDED GLYCATED HEMOGLOBIN AND LIPID PROFILES BEFORE AND AFTER THREE MONTHS. RESULTS: THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS (P < 0.001 ANCOVA) WITH IMPROVED SERUM TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDES, LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN, AND HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN IN THE YOGA GROUP COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. FURTHER, THE REGULATORY EFFECT OF YOGA WAS NOTED WITH A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE OR INCREASE IN THOSE WITH HIGH OR LOW VALUES OF LIPIDS, RESPECTIVELY, WITH MARGINAL OR NO CHANGE IN THOSE WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE. CONCLUSION: YOGA LIFESTYLE IMPROVES AND REGULATES (LOWERED IF HIGH, INCREASED IF LOW) THE BLOOD LIPID LEVELS IN BOTH GENDERS OF PREDIABETIC AND DIABETIC INDIVIDUALS IN BOTH RURAL AND URBAN INDIAN COMMUNITIES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
3 1849  48 QUASI PROSPECTIVE COMPARATIVE STUDY ON EFFECT OF YOGA AMONG PREDIABETICS ON PROGRESSION OF CARDIOVASCULAR RISK FACTORS. INTRODUCTION: PREDIABETIC PATIENTS HAVE HIGHER RISK FOR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES, WHICH FURTHER INCREASES THE RATE OF MORTALITY. REASON FOR THE RATE OF INCREASE MAY BE LACK OF OBSERVATION, FOLLOW-UP PROGRAMS, AND SELF-AWARENESS ABOUT THE CONDITIONS OF DISEASE. LIFESTYLE INTERVENTIONS SUCH AS YOGA CAN PROVE TO BE A BENEFICIAL NONPHARMACOLOGIC INTERVENTION IN PREVENTING PROGRESSION OF PREDIABETES TO TYPE 2 DIABETES. THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHTS IMPORTANCE OF SHORT-TERM INTERVENTION, I.E., YOGA IN PREDIABETIC PATIENTS AND USE IT AS A TOOL FOR PRIMARY PREVENTION OF DIABETES. METHODS: THIS WAS AN INTERVENTIONAL STUDY AMONG ADULTS AGED 30-50 YEARS IN RUHS COLLEGE OF MEDICAL SCIENCES AND ASSOCIATED RUKMANI DEVI BENI PRASAD JAIPURIA HOSPITAL IN JAIPUR CITY. THE DESIGN OF STUDY WAS QUASI PROSPECTIVE COMPARATIVE STUDY. A TOTAL OF 102 PREDIABETIC PATIENTS OF AGE GROUP 30-50 YEARS WERE RECRUITED FROM JAIPURIA HOSPITAL. THESE WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: STUDY GROUP (GROUP A, N = 51) WERE ENGAGED IN YOGA SESSION AND CONTROL GROUP (B, N = 51) NOT PERFORMED ANY YOGA SESSION. RESULTS: YOGA INTERVENTION RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN BLOOD GLUCOSE (P < 0.001), GLYCATED HEMOGLOBIN (P < 0.01), LIPID PROFILE CHOLESTEROL (P < 0.01), TRIGLYCERIDE (P < 0.01), AND LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (P < 0.01), BUT HIGH-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN (P < 0.02) AND VERY LOW-DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN INCREASE (P < 0.03) BUT NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RELATIVE TO THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: SHORT-TERM YOGA INTERVENTION IS HELPFUL IN THE CONTROL OF GLYCEMIC PARAMETERS LIKE BLOOD GLUCOSE, GLYCATED HEMOGLOBIN AND LIPID PROFILE IN PREDIABETIC PATIENTS. THIS PRELIMINARY STUDY INDICATES THAT A YOGA PROGRAM WOULD BE A POSSIBLE RISK REDUCTION OPTION FOR ADULTS AT HIGH RISK FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES. IN ADDITION, YOGA HOLDS PROMISE AS AN APPROACH TO REDUCING CARDIOMETABOLIC RISK FACTORS AND INCREASING EXERCISE SELF-EFFICACY FOR PREDIABETICS PERFORMING YOGA.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
4 1703  40 PARTITIONING OF RADIOLOGICAL, STRESS AND BIOCHEMICAL CHANGES IN PRE-DIABETIC WOMEN SUBJECTED TO DIABETIC YOGA PROTOCOL. BACKGROUND: YOGA IS AN ANCIENT SYSTEM OF WELLNESS WITH ASANA AND PRANAYAMA AS ITS MOST POPULAR AND PROPAGATED MODULES FOR MANAGEMENT OF LIFESTYLE DISORDERS. OBJECTIVES: THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO CHARACTERISE THE LIVER ABNORMALITIES, BIOCHEMICAL CHANGES, AND STRESS LEVELS AFTER YOGA INTERVENTION IN PREDIABETIC FEMALES. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 37 FEMALES WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO YOGA PRACTISING AND NON-PRACTISING CONTROL GROUPS. THE YOGA PRACTISING GROUP PERFORMED DIABETIC YOGA PROTOCOL (DYP) FOR 3 MONTHS. PARAMETERS INCLUDING SIZE OF LIVER, FATTY INFILTRATION, AND GRADE OF SEVERITY WERE MEASURED USING ULTRASONOGRAPHY ALONG WITH BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS AND STRESS LEVELS AT BASELINE AND AFTER YOGA PRACTICE. RESULTS: THE GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN (HBA1C) AND GLUCOSE LEVELS WERE FOUND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED IN PREDIABETIC (P=0.015) WOMEN AFTER PRACTISING DYP, ALTHOUGH CHOLESTEROL LEVELS INCREASED IN MENOPAUSAL WOMEN. NO ESCALATION OF FATTY LIVER WAS NOTED AMONG WOMEN PRACTISING DYP. CONCLUSION: DYP REDUCED THE HBA1C AND STRESS LEVELS AND THEREFORE, COULD BE A COST-EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR PREVENTING PREDIABETES TO DIABETES PROGRESSION.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
5  876  49 EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY ON REACTION TIME, BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS AND WELLNESS SCORE OF PERI AND POST-MENOPAUSAL DIABETIC PATIENTS. BACKGROUND: YOGIC PRACTICES MAY AID IN THE PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES MELLITUS (DM) AND REDUCE CARDIOVASCULAR COMPLICATIONS IN THE POPULATION. THE PRESENT STUDY HAS BEEN UNDERTAKEN TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY ON REACTION TIME, BIOCHEMICAL PARAMETERS AND WELLNESS SCORE OF PERI AND POST-MENOPAUSAL DIABETIC PATIENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 15 PERI AND POST-MENOPAUSAL PATIENTS RECEIVING STANDARD MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR TYPE 2 DM WERE RECRUITED AND REACTION TIME AND BIOCHEMICAL INVESTIGATIONS WERE DONE BEFORE AND AFTER A COMPREHENSIVE YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM COMPRISING OF THREE TIMES A WEEK SESSIONS FOR SIX WEEKS. A POST-INTERVENTION, RETROSPECTIVE WELLNESS QUESTIONNAIRE COMPILED BY ACYTER WAS USED TO EVALUATE THE COMPARATIVE FEELINGS OF THE PATIENTS AFTER THE THERAPY PROGRAM. RESULTS: YOGA TRAINING REDUCED AUDITORY REACTION TIME (ART) FROM RIGHT AS WELL AS LEFT HAND, THE DECREASE BEING STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P<0.05) FOR ART FROM THE RIGHT HAND. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT (P<0.01) DECREASE IN FASTING AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS AS WELL AS LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN. THE DECREASE IN TOTAL CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDES, AND VERY LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN AND INCREASE IN HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEIN WAS ALSO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P<0.05). ALL THE LIPID RATIOS SHOWED DESIRABLE IMPROVEMENT WITH A DECREASE (P<0.01) OF TC/HDL AND LDL/HDL RATIOS AND INCREASE (P<0.05) IN THE HDL/LDL RATIO. DISCUSSION OR CONCLUSION: SHORTENING OF RT IMPLIES AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE INFORMATION PROCESSING AND REFLEXES AND IS THE FIRST SUCH REPORT IN DIABETIC PATIENTS. THIS HAS CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE AND IS WORTH FURTHER EXPLORATION WITH WIDER, WELL CONTROLLED, RANDOMIZED STUDIES IN THE DIABETIC POPULATION. CHANGES IN BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS MAY BE DUE TO IMPROVED INSULIN SENSITIVITY, DECLINE IN INSULIN RESISTANCE AND INCREASED SENSITIVITY OF THE PANCREATIC B CELLS TO GLUCOSE SIGNALS. YOGA IMPROVED THE 'HEART FRIENDLY' STATUS OF LIPID PROFILE IN OUR SUBJECTS AND AS OUR PARTICIPANTS WERE PERI AND POST-MENOPAUSAL, THE DECREASE IN CARDIOVASCULAR RISK PROFILE IS OF GREATER SIGNIFICANCE. A COMPREHENSIVE YOGA THERAPY PROGRAM HAS THE POTENTIAL TO ENHANCE THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF STANDARD MEDICAL MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES MELLITUS AND CAN BE USED AS AN EFFECTIVE COMPLEMENTARY OR INTEGRATIVE THERAPY PROGRAM.	2012	

6  283  39 ADHERENCE TO YOGA AND ITS RESULTANT EFFECTS ON BLOOD GLUCOSE IN TYPE 2 DIABETES: A COMMUNITY-BASED FOLLOW-UP STUDY. AIM: TO STUDY THE ADHERENCE TO YOGA AND ITS EFFECTS ON BLOOD GLUCOSE PARAMETERS IN PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS. METHODS: A SINGLE GROUP LONGITUDINAL STUDY OVER 6 MONTHS WAS CONDUCTED AT VASK YOGA CENTRE, BANGALORE. FASTING BLOOD SUGAR, POST PRANDIAL BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS AND GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN AND QUALITATIVE IN-DEPTH INTERVIEW OF THE PARTICIPANTS AND THERAPIST WAS CONDUCTED AT BASELINE, END OF 3(RD) MONTH AND END OF 6 MONTHS; INTERMEDIATE OBSERVATIONS WAS CONDUCTED AT THE END OF EVERY MONTH. RESULTS: ADHERENCE TO YOGA IN THE COMMUNITY IN BANGALORE IS AROUND 50% OVER 6 MONTHS. PARTICIPANTS WHO COMPLETED THE YOGA PROGRAMME HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER HBA1C (END OF 3(RD) MONTH). AT THE END OF 6 MONTHS YOGA ADHERENCE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY NEGATIVELY CORRELATED WITH FBS AND STRESS. FURTHER THERE WAS A TREND TOWARDS THOSE WHO DROPPED OUT HAVING HIGHER FBS, CONTROLLING FOR MEDICATION INTAKE, STRESS LEVELS AND DIET PATTERN (OR = 1.027, P = 0.07). QUALITATIVE DATA REVEALED THAT MOST OF THE PARTICIPANTS JOINED AND COMPLETED THE YOGA PROGRAMME TO HELP CURE THEIR DIABETES. PARTICIPANTS WHO DROPPED OUT FROM THE YOGA PROGRAMME GAVE REASONS OF TRAVEL, ILL-HEALTH AND INCREASED WORK-LOAD AT OFFICE. CONCLUSIONS: ADHERENCE TO YOGA HAS AN EFFECT ON THE BLOOD GLUCOSE PARAMETERS IN DIABETES. HENCE, STRATEGIES TO MOTIVATE PARTICIPANTS TO UNDERGO 'LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION PRACTICES' INCLUDING MAXIMIZING ADHERENCE TO YOGA SHOULD BE THE FOCUS TO EXPERIENCE ANY BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
7  823  36 EFFECT OF YOGA ON GLUCOSE CONTROL AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS OF PREDIABETES. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE EFFECT OF YOGA ON FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE (FPG), POSTPRANDIAL PLASMA GLUCOSE, AND HEMOGLOBIN A1C (HBA1C) AND ALSO ON QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: THIS WAS A COHORT STUDY IN WHICH 100 DIAGNOSED CASES OF PREDIABETES WERE RECRUITED FOR DOING SPECIFIC YOGA, AND THEY THEMSELVES ACT AS CONTROL FOR THE STUDY. THE MEASUREMENT AND COMPARISON OF FPG, PRANDIAL PLASMA GLUCOSE (PPG), AND HBA1C WERE DONE AT THREE DIFFERENT TIME INTERVALS, THAT IS, BASELINE, 3 MONTHS, AND AT 6 MONTHS. THE ASSESSMENT OF QOL WAS DONE USING SF-36 SCALE. RESULTS: ONE HUNDRED PREDIABETIC CASES WERE SELECTED FOR THE STUDY IN WHICH IMPAIRED FASTING GLUCOSE (IFG) WAS PRESENT MORE IN YOUNGER POPULATION COMPARED TO IMPAIRED GLUCOSE TOLERANCE (IGT) AND IFG PLUS IGT BOTH OF WHICH ARE MORE PREVALENT IN MIDDLE AGE GROUP. THE YOGA THERAPY WAS FOUND TO HAVE FAVORABLE EFFECT ON FPG, PPG, AND HBA1C ALONG WITH VARIOUS ANTHROPOMETRY MEASURES STUDIED IN THIS STUDY. AFTER ADJUSTING CORRELATION COEFFICIENT FOR VARIOUS ANTHROPOMETRY MEASURES, YOGA WAS FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR CONTROLLING GLYCEMIC PARAMETERS IN PREDIABETICS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA IS A TYPE OF EXERCISE KNOWN TO IMPROVE GLYCEMIC CONTROL BY CHANGING ANTHROPOMETRY MEASURES, BUT OUR STUDY AIDS IN KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT BEYOND THIS KNOWN FACT THROUGH OTHER MECHANISMS YET TO BE EXPLORED.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
8  810  44 EFFECT OF YOGA ON BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS IN PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS. INTRODUCTION: IN VIEW OF PEOPLE EMBRACING SEDENTARY LIFE STYLE, AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TREATMENT BECOMING LESS, THE ROLE OF REGULAR EXERCISE ESPECIALLY 'YOGA' SEEMS TO BE A BENEFICIAL AND ECONOMICAL ADJUVANT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM). OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA ON BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS IN NORMAL AND T2DM VOLUNTEERS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A PROSPECTIVE CASE-CONTROL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN THE DEPARTMENT OF PHYSIOLOGY AND DIABETIC CLINIC OF A TERTIARY CARE TEACHING HOSPITAL OVER PERIOD OF TWO YEARS. THE STUDY SUBJECTS CONSISTED OF 30 MALE DIABETIC PATIENTS ATTENDING DIABETIC CLINIC AND 30 NON-DIABETIC MALE VOLUNTEERS CONSTITUTED CONTROL GROUP. THE PATIENTS IN THE AGE GROUP OF 36 TO 55 YEARS WITH T2DM OF AT LEAST ONE YEAR DURATION AND THOSE ON DIABETIC DIET AND ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC AGENTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY GROUP. THE AGE MATCHED HEALTHY MALE VOLUNTEERS WHO HAD COME TO JOIN YOGA TRAINING AT YOGA CENTRE WERE INCLUDED IN THE CONTROL GROUP. ALL THE PARTICIPANTS WERE TRAINED BY YOGA EXPERTS AND SUBJECTED TO REGULAR PRACTICE UNDER SUPERVISION FOR SIX MONTHS. IN ALL THE PARTICIPANTS FASTING (FBS) AND POST-PRANDIAL BLOOD SUGAR (PPBS) WAS ESTIMATED BEFORE, DURING (AT THREE MONTHS) AND AFTER (SIX MONTHS) YOGA TRAINING. PAIRED STUDENT T-TEST WAS USED TO ESTIMATE DIFFERENCE IN MEANS CALCULATED BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA TRAINING IN A SAME GROUP. A P-VALUE OF <0.05 WAS CONSIDERED AS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. RESULTS: THE DISTRIBUTION OF AGE, MEAN HEIGHT AND MEAN WEIGHT AMONG BOTH THE GROUPS WERE COMPARABLE. THE REDUCTION IN MEAN VALUES OF FBS AND PPBS AT THE END OF SIX MONTHS WAS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT (P <0.001) IN BOTH THE GROUPS WHEN COMPARED WITH THE MEAN VALUES BEFORE AND DURING (THREE MONTHS) YOGA PRACTICE. THE REDUCTION IN THESE VALUES AT THREE MONTHS DURING YOGA WAS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT IN T2DM GROUP WHEN COMPARED WITH MEAN VALUES BEFORE YOGA (P <0.001), BUT IT WAS INSIGNIFICANT (P<0.05) IN CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS OF THE PRESENT STUDY DEMONSTRATED THAT THE YOGA IS EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS IN PATIENTS WITH T2DM.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
9 1805  36 PREVALENCE OF TYPE 2 DIABETES AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS: A PILOT CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY IN TWO DISTRICTS IN INDIA. INTRODUCTION: DIABETES IS ONE OF THE MAJOR HEALTH DISEASES IN THE WORLD TODAY. THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES IS WELL-ESTABLISHED. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE PREVALENCE OF TYPE 2 DIABETES AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS IN TWO DISTRICTS OF INDIA (ONE EACH IN WEST AND SOUTH OF INDIA). METHODOLOGY: IN THIS CROSS-SECTIONAL FIELD STUDY, 155 YOGA PRACTITIONERS FROM PUNE AND 192 FROM ERNAKULAM DISTRICTS WERE ASSESSED USING THE DIABETES RISK TEST AND FASTING BLOOD SUGAR. THE DATA COLLECTED WERE ENTERED IN A STATISTICS SOFTWARE PACKAGE AND ANALYZED USING THE PEARSON'S CORRELATION ANALYSIS, T-TEST, UNIVARIATE ANOVA, AND LINEAR REGRESSION TO UNDERSTAND THE PREDICTORS OF RISK FOR DIABETES. RESULTS: THE OVERALL PREVALENCE OF DIABETES AMONG YOGA PRACTITIONERS IN CENTRAL PUNE WAS 3.6% (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI]: [0.01-0.04]). 18.9% OF PARTICIPANTS (95% CI: [0.16-0.19]) WERE DIAGNOSED TO BE "AT RISK" FOR DIABETES. IN ERNAKULAM, THE OVERALL PREVALENCE OF DIABETES AMONG PRACTITIONERS WAS 26% (95% CI: [0.05-0.06]) WITH 12% OF PRACTITIONERS (95% CI: [0.05-0.06]) DIAGNOSED TO BE "AT RISK" FOR DIABETES (PREDIABETIC). HIGHER AGE AND LESSER DURATION OF YOGA PRACTICE WERE SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS OF DIABETES. CONCLUSION: IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR EVERY PERSON ABOVE THE AGE OF 40 TO UNDERGO REGULAR HEALTH CHECK-UPS AND SCREENING FOR DIABETES AND INVOLVE ONESELF IN LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION PROGRAMS SUCH AS YOGA FOR SIGNIFICANTLY LONG DURATION OF TIME ON A DAILY BASIS, TO BETTER MANAGE DIABETES.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
10 1378  41 IMPACT OF INDIVIDUALIZED YOGA THERAPY ON PERCEIVED QUALITY OF LIFE PERFORMANCE ON COGNITIVE TASKS AND DEPRESSION AMONG TYPE II DIABETIC PATIENTS. CONTEXT: AN INDIVIDUALIZED APPROACH OF PROVIDING YOGA SUPPORT CAN ADDRESS MANY OF THE DISEASE-RELATED CONCERNS INDICATED IN THE MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES, SPECIFICALLY THE IMPACT ON OTHER LIFE ACTIVITIES AND LONG-TERM FUNCTIONAL WELLBEING. AIM: TO ANALYZE THE ROLE OF REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE AS A SELF-MANAGEMENT APPROACH TO ACHIEVE GLYCEMIC CONTROL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING IN TYPE II DIABETIC PATIENTS. METHODS: NINETY-ONE SUBJECTS OF BOTH SEXES RESPONDED TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT AND CONSENTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STUDY. THIS WAS A SINGLE GROUP, BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA EVALUATION WITHOUT CONTROL COMPARISON. THE FASTING AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD SUGAR, GLYCOSYLATED HEMOGLOBIN (HBA1C), COGNITIVE TASKS, DEPRESSION, COGNITIVE FAILURE, AND DIABETIC-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) WERE MEASURED AS PRETEST. THE SUBJECTS UNDERWENT ONE-TO-ONE INDIVIDUALIZED YOGA THERAPY SESSIONS, WHICH INCLUDED 12 SUPERVISED SESSIONS SPREAD OVER A 3-MONTH PERIOD. THE POSTTEST DATA WERE ANALYZED USING PAIRED T-TEST AND WILCOXON PAIRED RANK TEST. RESULTS: SHOWED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN FASTING BLOOD SUGAR. QOL OF THE DIABETIC PATIENTS HAD IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE FREQUENCY (MEAN DIFFERENCE OF 7.58, P > 0.01) OF DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND INTENSITY OF DEPRESSION (MEAN DIFFERENCE 1.66, P > 0.05). CONCENTRATION AND ATTENTION SPAN IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY AND MEAN DISCREPANCY SCORE REDUCED (MEAN DIFFERENCE 3.42, P > 0.01). THERE WERE NO MARKED CHANGES IN THE POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD SUGAR AND HBA1C. CONCLUSION: YOGA PRACTICE ENHANCES THE SUBJECTIVE WELLBEING, QOL, IMPROVES MOOD AND CONCENTRATION, AND FACILITATES ACHIEVEMENT OF ADEQUATE GLYCEMIC CONTROL AMONG TYPE II DIABETIC PATIENTS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
11  103  41 A PILOT CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY ON AWARENESS AND PRACTICE REGARDING TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS AND ITS MANAGEMENT WITH YOGA. DIABETES MELLITUS IS A METABOLIC DISORDER OF MULTIPLE ETIOLOGY, CHARACTERIZED BY CHRONIC HYPERGLYCAEMIA WITH DISTURBANCE OF CARBOHYDRATE, FAT, AND PROTEIN METABOLISM RESULTING FROM DEFECT IN INSULIN SECRETION, INSULIN ACTION OR BOTH. IMPROPER LIFESTYLE CONTRIBUTES TO THE INCREASING NUMBER OF PEOPLE AFFECTED WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM). SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS ON THE MANAGEMENT OF T2DM IN ADULTS THROUGH YOGA REPORTED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN MULTIPLE MODIFIABLE INDICES OF DIABETES MELLITUS MANAGEMENT INCLUDING GLYCEMIC CONTROL, LIPID LEVELS, AND BODY COMPOSITION. AWARENESS LEVELS OF A CONDITION AMONG THE POPULATION PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN BEHAVIOUR CHANGE. HOWEVER, STUDIES RELATED TO ASSESSING THE AWARENESS AND PRACTICE OF YOGA FOR MANAGING DISEASES ARE LIMITED. HENCE, THIS STUDY WAS FORMULATED WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF ASSESSING THE AWARENESS LEVEL AND EXTENT OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT DIABETES MELLITUS AND ITS MANAGEMENT THROUGH YOGA. A CROSS-SECTIONAL SURVEY WITH A SAMPLE SIZE OF 317 WAS CONDUCTED USING A STRUCTURED QUESTIONNAIRE AT 5 DISTRICTS IN TAMIL NADU AND KERALA. 95% OF THE STUDY POPULATION WERE AWARE OF DIABETES MELLITUS WHILE 61.2% RESPONDED THAT DIABETES CAN BE PREVENTED BY REGULAR EXERCISE AND HEALTHY DIET. 62.4% PEOPLE PERCEIVED THAT YOGA PRACTICES CAN PREVENT DIABETES MELLITUS AND 59% MENTIONED THAT REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE CAN HELP IN CONTROLLING DIABETES AND PREVENT FURTHER COMPLICATIONS. ONLY 13% REPORTED TO PRACTICE YOGA REGULARLY AT LEAST THREE DAYS A WEEK. IDENTIFYING A QUALIFIED YOGA TRAINER WAS REPORTED TO BE A LIMITING FACTOR FOR REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE. THE STUDY SUGGESTED THAT THERE IS A NEED TO INCREASE THE ACCESS TO QUALIFIED YOGA PROFESSIONALS AT COMMUNITY LEVEL. FURTHER LARGE SCALE STUDIES WITH RANDOM SAMPLING METHOD TO ASSESS THE AWARENESS LEVEL AND PRACTICE OF YOGA IN DIFFERENT SETTINGS IS INDICATED.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
12 1928  31 ROLE OF YOGA IN DIABETES. THE SCIENCE OF YOGA IS AN ANCIENT ONE. IT IS A RICH HERITAGE OF OUR CULTURE. SEVERAL OLDER BOOKS MAKE A MENTION OF THE USEFULNESS OF YOGA IN THE TREATMENT OF CERTAIN DISEASES AND PRESERVATION OF HEALTH IN NORMAL INDIVIDUALS. THE EFFECT OF YOGIC PRACTICES ON THE MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES HAS NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED WELL. WE CARRIED OUT WELL DESIGNED STUDIES IN NORMAL INDIVIDUALS AND THOSE WITH DIABETES TO ASSESS THE ROLE OF YOGIC PRACTICES ON GLYCAEMIC CONTROL, INSULIN KINETICS, BODY COMPOSITION EXERCISE TOLERANCE AND VARIOUS CO-MORBIDITIES LIKE HYPERTENSION AND DYSLIPIDEMIA. THESE STUDIES WERE BOTH SHORT TERM AND LONG-TERM. THESE STUDIES HAVE CONFIRMED THE USEFUL ROLE OF YOGA IN THE CONTROL OF DIABETES MELLITUS. FASTING AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS CAME DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY. GOOD GLYCAEMIC STATUS CAN BE MAINTAINED FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME. THERE WAS A LOWERING OF DRUG REQUIREMENT AND THE INCIDENCE OF ACUTE COMPLICATIONS LIKE INFECTION AND KETOSIS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE INSULIN KINETICS AND THOSE OF COUNTER-REGULATORY HORMONES LIKE CORTISOL. THERE WAS A DECREASE IN FREE FATTY ACIDS. THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN LEAN BODY MASS AND DECREASE IN BODY FAT PERCENTAGE. THE NUMBER OF INSULIN RECEPTORS WAS ALSO INCREASED. THERE WAS AN IMPROVEMENT IN INSULIN SENSITIVITY AND DECLINE IN INSULIN RESISTANCE. ALL THESE SUGGEST THAT YOGIC PRACTICES HAVE A ROLE EVEN IN THE PREVENTION OF DIABETES. THERE IS A BENEFICIAL EFFECT ON THE CO-MORBID CONDITIONS LIKE HYPERTENSION AND DYSLIPIDEMIA.	2007	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
13 2063  42 THE BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE COMPARED TO PHYSICAL EXERCISE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. YOGA IS INCREASINGLY USED AS AN ADJUNCTIVE THERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE-2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM). THE PRESENT STUDY AIMS TO SYSTEMATICALLY EVALUATE THE LITERATURE AND PERFORM A META-ANALYSIS ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA PRACTICE COMPARED TO PHYSICAL EXERCISE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF T2DM. DATA WERE OBTAINED USING A STEPWISE SEARCH PROCESS USING KEYWORDS IN THE FOLLOWING ONLINE MEDICAL DATABASES; PUBMED, WEB OF SCIENCE AND SCOPUS. ALL CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS INVOLVING PATIENTS WITH T2DM, COMPARING YOGA AS AN INTERVENTION WITH PHYSICAL EXERCISE AND EVALUATING GLYCAEMIC CONTROL AND OTHER OUTCOMES BETWEEN THE INTERVENTION AND CONTROL GROUPS WERE INCLUDED IN THE ANALYSIS. EIGHT STUDIES WERE ELIGIBLE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. IN TOTAL, 842 PARTICIPANTS WERE ASSIGNED TO A YOGA INTERVENTION OR A CONTROL GROUP WITH AN EXERCISE INTERVENTION AND THE AGE RANGE OF PARTICIPANTS WAS 30-78 YEARS. A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN FBG (15.16MG/DL), PPBG (28.66MG/DL), HBA1C (0.39%) AND BMI (0.71KG/M2) WAS NOTED IN THE INTERVENTION GROUP ('YOGA') COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP ('PHYSICAL EXERCISE') IN THE POOLED ANALYSIS. WE DID NOT OBSERVE ANY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS FOR LIPID PARAMETERS, OTHER BODY COMPOSITION MEASURES (WC AND WHR) AND BLOOD PRESSURE. IN CONCLUSION, OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT YOGA HAS BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON GLYCAEMIC CONTROL IN COMPARISON TO PHYSICAL EXERCISE IN T2DM HOWEVER, INDIVIDUAL STUDIES SHOWED CONSIDERABLE HETEROGENEITY. HENCE, FURTHER WELL-CONTROLLED RANDOMIZED TRIALS ARE REQUIRED PRIOR TO DRAWING CONCLUSIONS ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF YOGA IN COMPARISON TO PHYSICAL EXERCISE.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
14  882  45 EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON LIPID METABOLISM IN INDUSTRIAL WORKERS WITH REFERENCE TO BODY CONSTITUTION (PRAKRITI). INTRODUCTION: THE PROGRESSIVE INCREASE IN DYSLIPIDEMIA AND PHYSICAL INACTIVITY ARE CONSIDERED TO BE MAJOR RISK FACTORS FOR THE ONSET OF NON COMMUNICABLE DISEASES. AWARENESS OF BODY CONSTITUTION PLAYS A VITAL ROLE TO REGULARISE OPTIMUM HEALTH. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS PLANNED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICES ON LIPID METABOLISM WITH REFERENCE TO SPECIFIC BODY CONSTITUTION (PRAKRITI). METHODS: A SELF-AS-CONTROL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON 36 MALE HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS BETWEEN AGE GROUP OF 30-58 YEARS. THEIR PRAKRITI ANALYSIS WAS DONE USING STANDARDIZED, VALIDATED QUESTIONNAIRE AND WERE DIVIDED INTO VATA-PITTA (N = 16) AND PITTA-KAPHA (N = 20) GROUPS. THE ASSESSMENT OF LIPID PROFILE WAS DONE IN FASTING BLOOD SAMPLES BEFORE AND AFTER 12 WEEKS OF YOGA TRAINING. DATA WERE ANALYZED USING PAIRED T-TEST AND INDEPENDENT T-TEST. RESULTS: AFTER YOGA INTERVENTION, THE RESULT OF WITHIN GROUP COMPARISON REVEALED THAT IN VATA-PITTA (V-P) GROUP, SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE LEVELS OF TC, LDL (P < 0.001) AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN HDL (P < 0.01) WAS OBSERVED. WHILE, PITTA-KAPHA (P-K) GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN TC (P < 0.001), TG (P < 0.01), LDL (P < 0.001) AND VLDL (P < 0.05) LEVELS. FURTHER, THE RESULTS BETWEEN GROUPS REVEALED THAT P-K GROUP HAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER BASELINE LEVELS OF TC, TG AND VLDL AS COMPARED TO V-P GROUP (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: THE STUDY CONCLUDES THAT YOGA PRACTICES CAN EFFECTIVELY REGULATE LIPID METABOLISM AND TOTAL BODY ENERGY EXPENDITURE WITH REFERENCE TO SPECIFIC CONSTITUTIONAL TYPE (PRAKRITI) THAT MAY ACT AS A TOOL TO ASSESS MAGNITUDE OF METABOLIC FUNCTIONS.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
15 1366  35 IMPACT OF A 10 MINUTE SEATED YOGA PRACTICE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES. OBJECTIVE: WE SOUGHT TO PROSPECTIVELY EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF A 10 MINUTE SEATED YOGA PROGRAM ADDED TO STANDARD COMPREHENSIVE DIABETES CARE ON GLUCOSE CONTROL AND CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH IN THE SEVERELY ILL, MEDICALLY COMPLEX DIABETIC POPULATION. METHOD: A TOTAL OF 10 PATIENTS WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES, AGES 49-77, WITH DURATION OF DIABETES >10 YEARS AND HAEMOGLOBIN A1C >9% (75 MMOL/MOL) WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. PATIENTS RANDOMIZED TO A YOGA INTERVENTION WERE TAUGHT A 10 MINUTE SEATED YOGA PRACTICE, WERE GIVEN AN EXPLANATORY DVD AND A FOLD-OUT POCKET GUIDE TO ENCOURAGE ADHERENCE AT HOME, AND WERE INSTRUCTED TO INCORPORATE THE PRACTICE AS OFTEN AS THEY COULD. THE PATIENTS IN THE CONTROL ARM WERE PROVIDED INFORMATION AND HAND OUTS ON THE AVAILABLE YOGA CLASSES ON CAMPUS. RESULTS: AT 3 MONTH CLINICAL FOLLOW UP, THE MEAN DECREASE IN FASTING CAPILLARY BLOOD GLUCOSE (CBG) WAS 45% AMONG YOGA PARTICIPANTS (-5.2 +/- 4.1 MMOL/L). HEART RATE (HR) DROPPED BY 18% AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE (BP) DROPPED BY 29% IN THE INTERVENTION ARM, (-12.4 +/- 6.69 AND -26 +/- 12.05 MMHG, RESPECTIVELY). THERE WERE NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE HAEMOGLOBIN A1C, SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE, WEIGHT, OR BODY MASS INDEX IN EITHER GROUP. CONCLUSION: OUR SMALL PILOT STUDY REINFORCES THE CURRENT MEDICAL EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE USE OF YOGA, COMBINED WITH STANDARD CARE, TO IMPROVE HEALTH OUTCOMES IN DIABETES.	2016

17 1455  39 INFLUENCE OF TIME OF YOGA PRACTICE AND GENDER DIFFERENCES ON BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVELS IN TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS AND NORMAL HEALTHY ADULTS. BACKGROUND: PREVALENCE OF TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM) IS INCREASING WORLDWIDE. MANY STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA IN IMPROVING GLYCAEMIC CONTROL, WHEREAS NO STUDIES ARE AVAILABLE SHOWING THE IMPACT OF TIME OF PRACTICE ON GLUCOSE LEVELS. THE CURRENT STUDY EXPLORES THE EFFECT OF TIME OF YOGA PRACTICE ON GLUCOSE LEVELS IN COMMUNITY-DWELLING ADULTS WITH AND WITHOUT T2DM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 189 SUBJECTS WITH T2DM AND 121 SUBJECTS WITHOUT T2DM UNDERWENT A 10-DAY YOGA PROGRAM WHICH INCLUDES PRACTICAL AND THEORY LECTURE SESSIONS FOR 60MIN EVERY DAY, EITHER IN THE MORNING OR EVENING. BASELINE AND POST-INTERVENTION ASSESSMENTS OF FASTING PLASMA GLUCOSE (FPG) WERE MEASURED ON DAY-1 AND DAY-10, RESPECTIVELY. DATA ANALYSIS WERE DONE USING STATISTICAL PACKAGE FOR THE SOCIAL SCIENCES (SPSS), VERSION 16. RESULTS: RESULTS OF THE STUDY SHOWED THAT IN INDIVIDUALS WITH T2DM, A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER REDUCTION IN FPG WAS OBSERVED WHILE PRACTICING YOGA IN THE EVENING SESSIONS THAN IN THE MORNING SESSIONS. LIKEWISE, A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN FPG WAS OBSERVED ONLY IN WOMEN WHO PRACTICED YOGA IN THE EVENING THAN IN THE MORNING, IN NON-DIABETIC HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS, WHILE THE REDUCTION WAS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IN MEN. CONCLUSION: RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT REDUCTION IN FPG LEVEL WAS BETTER WHILE PRACTICING YOGA IN EVENING THAN MORNING. SIMILARLY, WOMEN HAD A BETTER REDUCTION IN BLOOD GLUCOSE LEVEL THAN MEN.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
18 1915  34 ROLE OF NATUROPATHY AND YOGA TREATMENT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF HYPERTENSION. AIM: THE PRIMARY AIM WAS TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF NATUROPATHY AND YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN TREATMENT OF MILD TO MODERATE HYPERTENSION. DESIGN: THE VARIABLES OF INTEREST WERE MEASURED AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE INTERVENTION USING A PRE-POST DESIGN. SETTING: THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED BY INYS MEDICAL RESEARCH SOCIETY IN JINDAL NATURE CURE INSTITUTE, BANGALORE. SUBJECTS: A TOTAL OF 104 SUBJECTS, ALREADY DIAGNOSED WITH MILD TO MODERATE HYPERTENSION AND ON TREATMENT WITH ANTIHYPERTENSIVE MEDICINES WERE INCLUDED IN STUDY. INTERVENTIONS: THE INTERVENTION CONSISTED OF VARIOUS INPATIENT ADMINISTRATION OF DIFFERENT NATUROPATHY TREATMENTS, YOGA THERAPIES, LOW CALORIE AND LOW SODIUM DIET FOR 21 DAYS. ANTIHYPERTENSIVE MEDICINES WERE WITHDRAWN FOR SOME PATIENTS IN ONE WEEK BASED UPON RESPONSE TO THE TREATMENT. OUTCOME MEASURES: THE OUTCOME MEASURES WERE VALUES OF DIASTOLIC AND SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE AND BODY WEIGHT. SUBJECTS WERE FOLLOWED FOR A PERIOD OF ONE YEAR AFTER EVERY 3 MONTHS. RESULTS: AFTER STARTING NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACH OF NATUROPATHY AND YOGA, SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE CAME DOWN FROM MEAN OF 139.6 TO 129.6 WHERE AS IT CAME DOWN FROM 91.2 TO 86.1 FOR DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE. AT THE SAME TIME FAVORABLE EFFECT WAS ALSO SEEN IN OTHER VARIABLES LIKE LIPID PROFILE AND BODY WEIGHT. AT THE END OF ONE YEAR OUT OF 57 PATIENTS WHO CAME FOR FOLLOW-UP, 14 CASES WERE FOUND TO HAVE BLOOD PRESSURE WITHIN NORMAL RANGES WITHOUT ANY MEDICATION OVER THE PREVIOUS 12 MONTHS. CONCLUSION: NATUROPATHY AND YOGA THERAPY CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A VALUABLE NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACH IN TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
19  625  46 DIABETIC YOGA PROTOCOL IMPROVES GLYCEMIC, ANTHROPOMETRIC AND LIPID LEVELS IN HIGH RISK INDIVIDUALS FOR DIABETES: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL FROM NORTHERN INDIA. PURPOSE: TO STUDY THE EFFECTIVENESS OF DIABETIC YOGA PROTOCOL (DYP) AGAINST MANAGEMENT OF CARDIOVASCULAR RISK PROFILE IN A HIGH-RISK COMMUNITY FOR DIABETES, FROM CHANDIGARH, INDIA. METHODS: THE STUDY WAS A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, CONDUCTED AS A SUB STUDY OF THE PAN INDIA TRIAL NIYANTRITA MADHUMEHA BHARATH (NMB). THE COHORT WAS IDENTIFIED THROUGH THE INDIAN DIABETES RISK SCORING (IDRS) (>/= 60) AND A TOTAL OF 184 INDIVIDUALS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO INTERVENTION (N = 91) AND CONTROL GROUPS (N = 93). THE DYP GROUP UNDERWENT THE SPECIFIC DYP TRAINING WHEREAS THE CONTROL GROUP FOLLOWED THEIR DAILY REGIMEN. THE STUDY OUTCOMES INCLUDED CHANGES IN GLYCEMIC AND LIPID PROFILE. ANALYSIS WAS DONE UNDER INTENT-TO-TREAT PRINCIPLE. RESULTS: THE 3 MONTHS DYP PRACTICE SHOWED DIVERSE RESULTS SHOWING GLYCEMIC AND LIPID PROFILE OF THE HIGH RISK INDIVIDUALS. THREE MONTHS OF DYP INTERVENTION WAS FOUND TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE LEVELS OF POST-PRANDIAL GLUCOSE LEVELS (P = 0.035) AND LDL-C LEVELS (P = 0.014) AND WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: THE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE DYP INTERVENTION COULD IMPROVE THE METABOLIC STATUS OF THE HIGH-DIABETES-RISK INDIVIDUALS WITH RESPECT TO THEIR GLUCOSE TOLERANCE AND LIPID LEVELS, PARTIALLY EXPLAINED BY THE REDUCTION IN ABDOMINAL OBESITY.

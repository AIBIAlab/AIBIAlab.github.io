4 2130  37 THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA TO PREVENT DIABETES MELLITUS TYPE 2: A PROTOCOL FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS. BACKGROUND: TYPE 2 DIABETES MELLITUS (T2DM) IS BECOMING A LEADING PROBLEM WORLDWIDE. EMERGING REPORTS REVEAL ALARMING EVIDENCE OF INCREASING PREVALENCE OF T2DM THAT HAS REACHED PANDEMIC LEVELS. DESPITE THE SIGNIFICANT INCIDENCE, THERE ARE LIMITED RELIABLE DATA RESOURCES AND COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PEOPLE WHO ARE A PREDIABETIC OR HIGH RISK FOR DEVELOPING T2DM. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROTOCOL IS TO CONDUCT A FULL-SCALE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSES ON THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON PEOPLE WHO ARE PREDIABETES OR HIGH RISK OF DEVELOPING T2DM. METHODS: THE ARTICLES ENROLLED IN THE STUDY WILL BE RETRIEVED FROM THE ONLINE DATABASES BETWEEN 2002 AND THE DATE THE SEARCHES ARE EXECUTED. THE SEARCHES WILL BE REPEATED JUST BEFORE THE FINAL ANALYSES AND FURTHER RELEVANT STUDIES FOR INCLUSION. WE WILL CONDUCT A BIBLIOGRAPHIC SEARCH IN DATABASES: MEDLINE/PUBMED, SCOPUS, COCHRANE LIBRARY, EBSCO, AND INDMED USING KEYWORDS INCLUDING PREDIABETES STATE, HIGH RISK FOR DIABETES, METABOLIC SYNDROME, AND YOGA. A DEFINED SEARCH STRATEGY WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ALONG WITH SELECTION CRITERIA TO OBTAIN FULL-TEXT ARTICLES OF RELEVANT STUDIES. THIS STUDY PROTOCOL WAS PREPARED ACCORDING TO THE PREFERRED REPORTING ITEMS FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND META-ANALYSIS FOR PROTOCOLS 2015 GUIDELINES. THERE WILL BE NO LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: THE PROPOSED STUDY WILL BE BASED ON PUBLISHED STUDIES AND PUBLICLY AVAILABLE ANONYMIZED DATA WITHOUT DIRECTLY INVOLVING HUMAN PARTICIPANTS AND THEREFORE REQUIRES NEITHER FORMAL HUMAN ETHICAL REVIEW NOR APPROVAL BY A HUMAN RESEARCH ETHICS COMMITTEE. WE PUBLISHED AN OUTLINE OF THE PROTOCOL IN THE INTERNATIONAL PROSPECTIVE REGISTER OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS (PROSPERO) IN 2018. WE PLAN TO DISSEMINATE THE FINDINGS OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS THROUGH PUBLICATION IN A PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL AND PRESENTATION AT RELEVANT CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS. IN ADDITION, WE BELIEVE THE RESULTS OF THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WILL HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICY AND PRACTICE. WE WILL PREPARE POLICYMAKER SUMMARY USING A VALIDATED FORMAT, DISSEMINATE THROUGH SOCIAL MEDIA AND EMAIL DISCUSSION GROUPS.

5  475  18 CLARIFY 2021: EXPLANATION AND ELABORATION OF THE DELPHI-BASED GUIDELINES FOR THE REPORTING OF YOGA RESEARCH. BACKGROUND: REPORTING OF YOGA RESEARCH OFTEN LACKS THE DETAIL REQUIRED FOR CLINICAL APPLICATION, STUDY REPLICATION, SUMMARY RESEARCH AND COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS STUDIES. METHODS: TO IMPROVE THE TRANSPARENCY OF REPORTING YOGA INTERVENTIONS, AND BUILDING ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF PREVIOUS REPORTING GUIDELINES, A GROUP OF INTERNATIONAL YOGA RESEARCH STAKEHOLDERS DEVELOPED THE CONSENSUS-BASED CHECKLIST STANDARDISING THE REPORTING OF INTERVENTIONS FOR YOGA (CLARIFY) GUIDELINES. RESULTS: THE 21-ITEM CLARIFY CHECKLIST OUTLINES THE MINIMUM DETAILS CONSIDERED NECESSARY FOR HIGH-QUALITY REPORTING OF YOGA RESEARCH. THIS PAPER PROVIDES A DETAILED EXPLANATION OF EACH OF THE 21 ITEMS OF THE CLARIFY CHECKLIST, TOGETHER WITH MODEL EXAMPLES OF HOW TO INTEGRATE EACH ITEM INTO PUBLICATIONS OF YOGA RESEARCH. THE CLARIFY GUIDELINE SERVES AS AN EXTENSION FOR EXISTING RESEARCH REPORTING GUIDELINES, AND IS FLEXIBLE FOR USE ACROSS ALL STUDY DESIGNS. CONCLUSION: WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE THE UPTAKE OF THESE REPORTING GUIDELINES BY RESEARCHERS AND JOURNALS, TO FACILITATE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE TRANSPARENCY AND UTILITY OF YOGA RESEARCH.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
6  619  26 DEVELOPMENT OF THE CLARIFY (CHECKLIST STANDARDISING THE REPORTING OF INTERVENTIONS FOR YOGA) GUIDELINES: A DELPHI STUDY. BACKGROUND: THE USE OF YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC MODALITY IS INCREASING; HOWEVER, A LACK OF TRANSPARENT INTERVENTION REPORTING IS RESTRICTING THE DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF YOGA RESEARCH INTO CLINICAL AND COMMUNITY PRACTICE. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DEVELOP A YOGA-SPECIFIC REPORTING GUIDELINE AS AN EXTENSION TO EXISTING REPORTING GUIDELINES FOR RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS, OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES AND CASE REPORTS. METHODS: RECOGNISED INTERNATIONAL STAKEHOLDERS IN THE DESIGN AND CONDUCT OF YOGA RESEARCH WERE INVITED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE ELECTRONIC DELPHI SURVEY. A FOUR-ROUND DELPHI WAS CONDUCTED, WHEREBY PANELLISTS RATED SELECTED ITEMS FOR THEIR IMPORTANCE IN THE INCLUSION OF YOGA REPORTING GUIDELINES, ACCORDING TO A 5-STEP LIKERT SCALE. A PRIORI CONSENSUS FOR ITEM INCLUSION WAS AGREEMENT OF ITEMS AS 'VERY IMPORTANT' OR 'EXTREMELY IMPORTANT' BY >/=80% OF PANELLISTS. NON-CONSENSUS ITEMS WERE FORWARDED TO SUBSEQUENT ROUNDS FOR RE-RATING. RESULTS: 53 EXPERTS IN YOGA RESEARCH FROM 11 COUNTRIES, PRIMARILY IDENTIFYING AS RESEARCHERS (50%), ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS (18.8%) AND YOGA PROFESSIONALS (12.5%), CONSENTED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DELPHI. OF THESE, 48 COMPLETED ROUND 1 (91%), 43 COMPLETED ROUND 2 (81%), 39 COMPLETED ROUND 3 (74%) AND 32 COMPLETED ROUND 4 (60%). PANELLISTS REACHED CONSENSUS FOR INCLUSION ON 21 ITEMS, GROUPED UNDER 10 DOMAINS REFLECTIVE OF MORE GENERIC INTERVENTION-BASED GUIDELINES. CONCLUSIONS: THE CONSENSUS-BASED 21-ITEM CLARIFY (CHECKLIST STANDARDISING THE REPORTING OF INTERVENTIONS FOR YOGA) CHECKLIST PROVIDES A MINIMUM REPORTING TEMPLATE FOR RESEARCHERS ACROSS A RANGE OF METHODOLOGY DESIGNS. USE OF THESE YOGA-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CLARIFY EXPLANATION AND ELABORATION GUIDELINES, WILL STANDARDISE THE MINIMUM LEVEL OF DETAIL REQUIRED FOR TRANSPARENT YOGA INTERVENTION, FACILITATING THE REPLICATION, DISSEMINATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF YOGA RESEARCH. ONGOING RESEARCH WILL ASSESS THE UPTAKE AND IMPACT OF CLARIFY, TO ENSURE THESE GUIDELINES RETAIN THEIR RELEVANCE TO THE INTERNATIONALLY GROWING FIELD OF YOGA RESEARCH.	2022	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
7 2121  38 THE EFFECTIVENESS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF PREGNANCY YOGA INTERVENTIONS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW PROTOCOL. BACKGROUND: THE PURPOSE OF THIS REVIEW IS TO SYSTEMATICALLY EXAMINE THE REPORTED CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS OF PREGNANCY YOGA. THE REVIEW WILL USE THE FITT (FREQUENCY, INTENSITY, TIME/DURATION AND TYPE) PRINCIPLE OF PHYSICAL ACTIVITY TO CHARACTERISE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN EVALUATED IN THE INCLUDED STUDIES. STUDIES WILL BE CATEGORISED AS EFFECTIVENESS OR EFFICACY STUDIES AND THIS CONTINUUM OF EFFICACY VERSUS EFFECTIVENESS WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE FULL REVIEW. METHODS/DESIGN: THE FOLLOWING ELECTRONIC DATABASES WILL BE SEARCHED USING A DETAILED SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, WHOLIS, AMED, SCIELO, ASSIA AND WEB OF SCIENCE. RANDOMISED CONTROL TRIALS AND QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES EXAMINING PREGNANCY YOGA AND REPORTING ON EFFECT WILL BE INCLUDED. TITLES, ABSTRACTS AND FULL ARTICLES WILL BE SCREENED BY TWO INVESTIGATORS INDEPENDENTLY TO IDENTIFY ELIGIBLE STUDIES. THE COCHRANE COLLABORATION'S RISK OF BIAS ASSESSMENT TOOL WILL BE USED TO ASSESS STUDY QUALITY. QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE WILL BE EVALUATED USING THE GRADE CRITERIA. A STANDARDISED DATA EXTRACTION FORM WILL BE USED TO EXTRACT DATA. EFFECT SIZES WILL BE ESTIMATED USING MEAN DIFFERENCES FOR CONTINUOUS OUTCOMES, AND RELATIVE RISKS FOR DICHOTOMOUS OUTCOME. WHERE POSSIBLE, POOLING OF EFFECT ESTIMATES WILL BE DONE USING A RANDOM EFFECT MODEL. THE OUTCOMES OF INTEREST ARE QUALITY OF LIFE, STRESS, ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, MODE OF BIRTH, LABOUR DURATION AND PAIN MANAGEMENT IN LABOUR. DISCUSSION: THIS REVIEW WILL SYNTHESISE THE BEST AVAILABLE EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA DURING PREGNANCY AND PROVIDE VALUABLE HIGH-QUALITY INFORMATION FOR CLINICIANS AND HEALTH POLICYMAKERS. FINDINGS WILL BE DISSEMINATED THROUGH PUBLICATION IN A PEER-REVIEWED JOURNAL AND PRESENTATION AT RELEVANT CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS.

8  317  32 AN INTEGRATED METHODOLOGY TO ASSESS COMPLIANCE WITH DELPHI SURVEY KEY COMPONENTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS AS APPLIED IN A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF FIBROMYALGIA STUDIES. OBJECTIVE: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS ARTICLE WAS TO PRESENT A METHODOLOGY INCORPORATING EXISTING GUIDELINES AND TOOLS FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND TO EVALUATE THE DELPHI SURVEY 33 KEY COMPONENT RECOMMENDATIONS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS AS A TOOL FOR A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW IN FIBROMYALGIA STUDIES. DATA SOURCES: DATABASES SEARCHED INCLUDED PUBMED, OVID MEDLINE, PSYCHINFO, THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, CINAHL, ALT HEALTHWATCH, PEDRO, AND WEB OF SCIENCE. ARTICLE SELECTION: SELECTED WERE ARTICLES PUBLISHED BETWEEN NOVEMBER 14, 2004 AND NOVEMBER 13, 2014, WRITTEN IN ENGLISH, REPORTING ORIGINAL RESEARCH OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR ADULTS WITH FIBROMYALGIA. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: SIX ARTICLES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA, REVEALING THAT THREE YOGA STYLES ("RELAXING" YOGA, YOGA OF AWARENESS, AND HATHA YOGA) HAVE BEEN ASSESSED IN PERSONS WITH FIBROMYALGIA. OVERALL, REPORTING COMPLIANCE WITH THE 33 KEY COMPONENTS RANGED FROM 39.4% TO 84.8%, WITH A MEAN ADHERENCE RATE OF 62.63% +/- 17.74. NONE OF THE AUTHORS USED AN ACCEPTED REPORTING GUIDELINE; SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OF ASANA, PRANAYAMA, RELAXATION, AND MINDFULNESS PRACTICES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED INTO THE INTERVENTIONS TESTED WERE IDENTIFIED IN ONLY 33.33% OF THE ARTICLES REVIEWED; AND NONE OF THE ARTICLES INCLUDED DETAILED, REPLICABLE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE INTERVENTIONS. CONCLUSIONS: THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW SUPPORTS THE NEED FOR COMPREHENSIVE YOGA RESEARCH GUIDELINES. FINDINGS REVEAL A LACK OF REPORTING OF INTERVENTION DETAILS, THE NEED TO REPORT A DISEASE-SPECIFIC RATIONALE FOR SELECTION OF THE PARTICULAR YOGA STYLE USED FOR THE INTERVENTION, AND THAT A LIMITED NUMBER OF YOGA STYLES HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED IN PERSONS WITH FIBROMYALGIA.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
9  477  40 CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF YOGA FOR THE PEDIATRIC POPULATION: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW. OBJECTIVE: THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE EVIDENCE FOR CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF YOGA AMONG THE PEDIATRIC POPULATION. METHODS: WE CONDUCTED AN ELECTRONIC LITERATURE SEARCH INCLUDING CINAHL, COCHRANE CENTRAL REGISTER OF CONTROLLED TRIALS (CENTRAL), EMBASE, MEDLINE, PSYCINFO, AND MANUAL SEARCH OF RETRIEVED ARTICLES FROM INCEPTION OF EACH DATABASE UNTIL DECEMBER 2008. RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) AND NONRANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (NRCTS) WERE SELECTED THAT INCLUDED YOGA OR YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS FOR INDIVIDUALS AGED 0 TO 21 YEARS. DATA WERE EXTRACTED AND ARTICLES CRITICALLY REVIEWED USING A MODIFIED JADAD SCORE AND DESCRIPTIVE METHODOLOGICAL CRITERIA, WITH SUMMARIZATION IN TABLES. RESULTS: THIRTY-FOUR CONTROLLED STUDIES PUBLISHED FROM 1979 TO 2008 WERE IDENTIFIED, WITH 19 RCTS AND 15 NRCTS. MANY STUDIES WERE OF LOW METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY. CLINICAL AREAS FOR WHICH YOGA HAS BEEN STUDIED INCLUDE PHYSICAL FITNESS, CARDIORESPIRATORY EFFECTS, MOTOR SKILLS/STRENGTH, MENTAL HEALTH AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISORDERS, BEHAVIOR AND DEVELOPMENT, IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME, AND BIRTH OUTCOMES FOLLOWING PRENATAL YOGA. NO ADVERSE EVENTS WERE REPORTED IN TRIALS REVIEWED. ALTHOUGH A LARGE MAJORITY OF STUDIES WERE POSITIVE, METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS SUCH AS RANDOMIZATION METHODS, WITHDRAWAL/DROPOUTS, AND DETAILS OF YOGA INTERVENTION PRECLUDE CONCLUSIVE EVIDENCE. CONCLUSIONS: THERE ARE LIMITED DATA ON THE CLINICAL APPLICATIONS OF YOGA AMONG THE PEDIATRIC POPULATION. MOST PUBLISHED CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE SUGGESTIVE OF BENEFIT, BUT RESULTS ARE PRELIMINARY BASED ON LOW QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF TRIALS. FURTHER RESEARCH OF YOGA FOR CHILDREN BY USING A HIGHER STANDARD OF METHODOLOGY AND REPORTING IS WARRANTED.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
10 1064  29 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON IMMUNE FUNCTION: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS. OBJECTIVE: THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW ATTEMPTS TO CONFIRM THE ADDED EVIDENCE TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON IMMUNE FUNCTION. METHODS: THE COCHRANE LIBRARY, EMBASE, PSYCINFO, PUBMED, AND WEB OF SCIENCE ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE SEARCHED ACCORDING TO THE PRISRMA METHOD TO IDENTIFY RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) ON THE IMMUNOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF YOGA PUBLISHED IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE FROM JANUARY 1, 2017, TO DECEMBER 31, 2020. THIS REVIEW COULD ONLY BE DESCRIPTIVELY SUMMARIZED BECAUSE OF HETEROGENEITY OF THE INCLUDED RCTS. RESULTS: ELEVEN POTENTIAL TRIALS WERE IDENTIFIED AND INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW. QUALITY APPRAISAL OF INCLUDED TRIALS RANGED FROM 3 FOR UNCLEAR RISK OF BIAS AND 8 FOR HIGH RISK OF BIAS. THERE IS EVIDENCE FROM 11 RCTS THAT YOGA MAY HAVE FAVORABLE EFFECTS FOR REDUCING THE LEVELS OF ANTI-INFLAMMATORY MARKERS. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA MAY BE USED AS A COMPLEMENTARY INTERVENTION FOR CLINICAL POPULATIONS OR HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
11 1158  28 ESTABLISHING KEY COMPONENTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS: A DELPHI SURVEY. BACKGROUND: EVIDENCE SUGGESTS YOGA IS A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS. HOWEVER, HETEROGENEITY IN THE COMPONENTS AND REPORTING OF CLINICAL YOGA TRIALS IMPEDES BOTH THE GENERALIZATION OF STUDY RESULTS AND THE REPLICATION OF STUDY PROTOCOLS. THE AIM OF THIS DELPHI SURVEY WAS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES OF HETEROGENEITY, BY DEVELOPING A LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS OF KEY COMPONENTS FOR THE DESIGN AND REPORTING OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS. METHODS: RECOGNISED EXPERTS INVOLVED IN THE DESIGN, CONDUCT, AND TEACHING OF YOGA FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS WERE IDENTIFIED FROM A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW, AND INVITED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE DELPHI SURVEY. FORTY-ONE OF THE 58 EXPERTS CONTACTED, REPRESENTING SIX COUNTRIES, AGREED TO PARTICIPATE. A THREE-ROUND DELPHI WAS CONDUCTED VIA ELECTRONIC SURVEYS. ROUND 1 PRESENTED AN OPEN-ENDED QUESTION, ALLOWING PANELLISTS TO INDIVIDUALLY IDENTIFY COMPONENTS THEY CONSIDERED KEY TO THE DESIGN AND REPORTING OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS. THEMATIC ANALYSIS OF ROUND 1 IDENTIFIED ITEMS FOR QUANTITATIVE RATING IN ROUND 2; ITEMS NOT REACHING CONSENSUS WERE FORWARDED TO ROUND 3 FOR RE-RATING. RESULTS: THIRTY-SIX PANELLISTS (36/41; 88%) COMPLETED THE THREE ROUNDS OF THE DELPHI SURVEY. PANELLISTS PROVIDED 348 COMMENTS TO THE ROUND 1 QUESTION. THESE COMMENTS WERE REDUCED TO 49 ITEMS, GROUPED UNDER FIVE THEMES, FOR RATING IN SUBSEQUENT ROUNDS. A PRIORI GROUP CONSENSUS OF >/=80% WAS REACHED ON 28 ITEMS RELATED TO FIVE THEMES CONCERNING DEFINING THE YOGA INTERVENTION, TYPES OF YOGA PRACTICES TO INCLUDE IN AN INTERVENTION, DELIVERY OF THE YOGA PROTOCOL, DOMAINS OF OUTCOME MEASURES, AND REPORTING OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS. ADDITIONALLY, A PRIORI CONSENSUS OF >/=50% WAS REACHED ON FIVE ITEMS RELATING TO MINIMUM VALUES FOR INTERVENTION PARAMETERS. CONCLUSIONS: EXPERT CONSENSUS HAS PROVIDED A NON-PRESCRIPTIVE REFERENCE LIST FOR THE DESIGN AND REPORTING OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS. IT IS ANTICIPATED FUTURE RESEARCH INCORPORATING THE DELPHI GUIDELINES WILL FACILITATE HIGH QUALITY INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH IN THIS FIELD, INCREASE HOMOGENEITY OF INTERVENTION COMPONENTS AND PARAMETERS, AND ENHANCE THE COMPARISON AND REPRODUCIBILITY OF RESEARCH INTO THE USE OF YOGA FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS.	2014	

12 1689  28 OVERVIEW OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS: YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION FOR ADULTS WITH ACUTE AND CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS. OBJECTIVES. OVERVIEW THE QUALITY, DIRECTION, AND CHARACTERISTICS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR TREATMENT OF ACUTE AND CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS IN ADULT POPULATIONS. METHODS. WE SEARCHED FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS IN 10 ONLINE DATABASES, BIBLIOGRAPHIC REFERENCES, AND HAND-SEARCHES IN YOGA-RELATED JOURNALS. INCLUDED REVIEWS SATISFY OXMAN CRITERIA AND SPECIFY YOGA AS A PRIMARY INTERVENTION IN ONE OR MORE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS FOR TREATMENT IN ADULTS. THE AMSTAR TOOL AND GRADE APPROACH EVALUATED THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY OF REVIEWS AND QUALITY OF EVIDENCE. RESULTS. WE IDENTIFIED 2202 TITLES, OF WHICH 41 FULL-TEXT ARTICLES WERE ASSESSED FOR ELIGIBILITY AND 26 SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS SATISFIED INCLUSION CRITERIA. THIRTEEN SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS INCLUDE QUANTITATIVE DATA AND SIX PAPERS INCLUDE META-ANALYSIS. THE QUALITY OF EVIDENCE IS GENERALLY LOW. SIXTEEN DIFFERENT TYPES OF HEALTH CONDITIONS ARE INCLUDED. ELEVEN REVIEWS SHOW TENDENCY TOWARDS POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTION, 15 REVIEWS REPORT UNCLEAR RESULTS, AND NO, REVIEWS REPORT ADVERSE EFFECTS OF YOGA. YOGA APPEARS MOST EFFECTIVE FOR REDUCING SYMPTOMS IN ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND PAIN. CONCLUSION. ALTHOUGH THE QUALITY OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS IS HIGH, THE QUALITY OF SUPPORTING EVIDENCE IS LOW. SIGNIFICANT HETEROGENEITY AND VARIABILITY IN REPORTING INTERVENTIONS BY TYPE OF YOGA, SETTINGS, AND POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS LIMIT THE GENERALIZABILITY OF RESULTS.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
13 1142  31 EFFICACY, FEASIBILITY, AND ACCEPTABILITY OF PERINATAL YOGA ON WOMEN'S MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW. INTRODUCTION: PERINATAL MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER AFFECTS 20% OF WOMEN, WHILE PERINATAL ANXIETY AFFECTS 10% OF WOMEN. ALTHOUGH PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENT HAS SHOWN EFFECTIVENESS, MANY PREGNANT WOMEN ARE CONCERNED ABOUT POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE FETUS, MATERNAL-INFANT BONDING, AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT. APPROXIMATELY 38% OF AMERICAN ADULTS USE COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE, INCLUDING YOGA AND OTHER MIND-BODY STRATEGIES. ALTHOUGH COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE HAS BEEN LESS STUDIED IN THE PERINATAL POPULATION, IT POTENTIALLY OFFERS WOMEN AND THEIR PROVIDERS ALTERNATIVES TO TRADITIONAL MEDICATION FOR TREATMENT OF PERINATAL DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY. THUS, THE PURPOSE OF THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WAS TO EXAMINE EXISTING EMPIRICAL LITERATURE ON YOGA AND ITS EFFECTS ON WOMEN'S HEALTH AND WELL-BEING DURING THE PERINATAL PERIOD. METHOD: FOLLOWING PRISMA (PREFERRED REPORTING ITEMS FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND META-ANALYSES) GUIDELINES FOR SYSTEMIC LITERATURE REVIEWS, LITERATURE SEARCHES USING RELEVANT SEARCH TERMS WERE PERFORMED IN FOUR MAJOR ELECTRONIC DATABASES: CINAHL, PUBMED, PSYCINFO, AND EMBASE. THIRTEEN PUBLICATIONS MET INCLUSION CRITERIA. RESULTS: RESULTS INDICATED THAT YOGA INTERVENTIONS ARE GENERALLY EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION IN PREGNANT WOMEN. DISCUSSION: THE USE OF YOGA IN THE PERINATAL PERIOD SHOWS PROMISE IN IMPROVING MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING FOR WOMEN AND INFANTS. THIS REVIEW CAN INFORM FUTURE YOGA INTERVENTION STUDIES AND CLINICAL PRACTICE WITH THE PERINATAL POPULATION.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
14 1518  25 IS YOGA CONSIDERED EXERCISE WITHIN SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS? A SCOPING REVIEW. OBJECTIVE: YOGA IS AN INCREASINGLY POPULAR CHOICE OF EXERCISE FOR THE WESTERN POPULATION, WITH PEOPLE ENGAGING IN YOGA FOR A RANGE OF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING REASONS. THE AIM OF THIS SCOPING REVIEW IS TO EXAMINE WHETHER YOGA IS CONSIDERED AN EXERCISE MODALITY WITHIN RELEVANT LEADING JOURNALS, AS EVIDENCED BY ITS CONSIDERATION IN SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS (SRS) OF EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS FOR HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOMES. METHODS: DESIGN: SCOPING REVIEW. DATA SOURCES: THREE LEADING SOURCES (SPORTS MEDICINE, BRITISH JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE AND COCHRANE COLLABORATION) WERE SEARCHED. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: THE TEN MOST RECENTLY PUBLISHED SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS FOR HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOMES FROM EACH JOURNAL WERE INCLUDED (N = 30) THAT MET THESE CRITERIA: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW STUDYING HUMANS PARTICIPATING IN GENERAL EXERCISE AND MEASURING A HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOME. EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS WITH ANY SPECIFIC QUALIFYING TERMS (E.G. AQUATIC, STRENGTH, AEROBIC) WERE EXCLUDED. RESULTS: THE ARTICLES RETRIEVED WERE PUBLISHED BETWEEN 2007 AND 2019, AND COLLECTIVELY INCLUDED 991 INTERVENTIONS. SEVEN REVIEWS EXPLICITLY STATED THAT YOGA WAS TO BE INCLUDED/EXCLUDED WHILE TWENTY-THREE STUDIES MADE NO MENTION OF HOW YOGA WAS BEING CONSIDERED IN THE METHODOLOGY. FIVE STUDIES INCLUDED YOGA IN THE SEARCH STRATEGY, IMPLYING ITS INCLUSION. POST-HOC ANALYSES FOUND THAT THE DEFINITIONS OF EXERCISE IN GENERAL WERE ALSO VARIABLE. EXERCISE DEFINITION SPECIFICITY WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH WHETHER OR NOT YOGA WAS ASSESSED FOR INCLUSION. CONCLUSIONS: SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF EXERCISE AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY INTERVENTIONS FOR HEALTH-RELATED OUTCOMES DO NOT CONSISTENTLY MAKE CLEAR WHETHER OR NOT THEY INCLUDE OR EXCLUDE YOGA AS A FORM OF EXERCISE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
15  495  24 COMBATING THE PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC THROUGH YOGA: RECOMMENDATION FROM AN OVERVIEW. GLOBALLY, THE PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH OF THE PEOPLE IS BEING AFFECTED DUE TO THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. GIVEN THE FACT THAT NUMEROUS SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS ALREADY EXIST ON YOGA AND MENTAL HEALTH, IT BECOMES VITAL TO UNDERTAKE AN OVERVIEW ON THE SAME. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE OVERVIEW WAS TO SUMMARISE THE EVIDENCE FROM DIFFERENT SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS OF DISTINCT YOGA INTERVENTIONS USED TO IMPROVE MENTAL HEALTH AND RECOMMEND YOGA PRACTICES FOR THE SAME. THE PROTOCOL WAS REGISTERED ON PROSPERO (CRD42020185221). MEDLINE VIA PUBMED, COCHRANE DATABASE OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR WERE SEARCHED FOR RELEVANT LITERATURE. SEARCH TERMS USED WERE "YOGA PRACTICE, MENTAL HEALTH AND SYSTEMATIC REVIEW". REVIEWS FROM EARLIEST POSSIBLE DATE TILL MAY 2020, INCLUDING THOSE EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF ANY SINGLE OR COMBINATION OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON MENTAL HEALTH REPORTED ON CHILDREN, YOUTH AND ADULTS WERE SELECTED. THE ASSESSMENT OF MULTIPLE SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS (AMSTAR) TOOL WAS USED TO EVALUATE THE EVIDENCE OF THE INCLUDED REVIEWS. OUT OF THE 90 REVIEWS FOUND, EIGHT UNIQUE REVIEWS WERE SELECTED FOR THE OVERVIEW. OVERALL, 243 STUDIES WERE ANALYZED, WITH AN OVERLAP OF ONLY 6 STUDIES ACROSS THE REVIEWS. OUT OF 8 REVIEWS, ONLY 2 WERE OF HIGH QUALITY AND THE REST WERE OF MODERATE QUALITY. OWING TO HETEROGENEITY OF THE INCLUDED STUDIES, ONLY DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS WAS POSSIBLE. THE RESULTS OF THE REVIEW INDICATE MODERATE TO POSITIVE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON THE MENTAL HEALTH PARAMETERS. PRACTICING YOGA (PHYSICAL POSTURES, BHRAMARY PRANAYAM, MINDFULNESS MEDITATION, SAHAJ YOGA AND LAUGHTER THERAPY) CAN BE BENEFICIAL TO IMPROVE PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH OF THE PEOPLE DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
16 2269  31 THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOGA AND SPIRITUALITY: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF EMPIRICAL RESEARCH. OBJECTIVE: BOTH YOGA PRACTICE AND SPIRITUALITY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH BENEFICIAL MENTAL HEALTH OUTCOMES. WITHIN YOGA RESEARCH, HOWEVER, SPIRITUALITY IS STILL A WIDELY NEGLECTED AREA. THE PRESENT SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AIMS TO EXPLORE EMPIRICAL STUDIES, WHICH DO, IN FACT, INVESTIGATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOGA AND SPIRITUALITY IN ORDER TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS FOR RESEARCH ON THIS TOPIC. THE REVIEW EXAMINES WHETHER AVAILABLE EMPIRICAL RESEARCH SUPPORTS AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN YOGA PRACTICE AND SPIRITUALITY AND, IF SO, WHICH SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF SPIRITUALITY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH YOGA PRACTICE. METHODS: THE SYSTEMATIC REVIEW FOLLOWED THE PRISMA GUIDELINE (PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42020155043). EMPIRICAL STUDIES WRITTEN IN ENGLISH, GERMAN, OR HUNGARIAN LANGUAGE WERE SELECTED FROM A DATABASE SEARCH IN GOOGLE SCHOLAR, PSYCINFO, AND SCIENCE DIRECT. A TOTAL OF 30 STUDIES MET THE FINAL INCLUSION CRITERIA. RESULTS: ACCORDING TO THE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE STUDIES REVIEWED, YOGA PRACTICE SEEMS TO BE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH SPIRITUALITY. THIS ASSOCIATION CONCERNS VARIOUS ASPECTS OF SPIRITUALITY, SUCH AS SPIRITUAL ASPIRATIONS, A SEARCH FOR INSIGHT/WISDOM, AN INTEGRATIVE WORLDVIEW, A SENSE OF MEANING AND PEACE, FAITH, HOPE, COMPASSION, AND HAPPINESS WITHIN. TO HARNESS THE POTENTIAL SPIRITUAL BENEFITS OF YOGA, REGULAR PRACTICE APPEARS TO BE ESSENTIAL. YOGA PRACTITIONERS SEEM TO HAVE BOTH PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL MOTIVES FOR PRACTICING. AT LEAST IN WESTERN SOCIETIES, HOWEVER, PHYSICAL INTENTIONS ARE MORE PREVALENT THAN SPIRITUAL ONES. THE MEANING OF SPIRITUALITY FOR YOGA PRACTITIONERS IS ALSO DISCUSSED. DUE TO RISK OF BIAS OF THE MAJORITY OF THE REVIEWED STUDIES, HOWEVER, OUTCOMES MUST BE TAKEN WITH CAUTION. CONCLUSION: YOGA PRACTICE MAY BE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERAL ASPECTS OF SPIRITUALITY. FOR MORE EVIDENCE, FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF THE TOPIC IS SUGGESTED. PARTICULARLY, WE PROPOSE THE INCLUSION OF HOLISTIC FORMS OF YOGA PRACTICE AND A COMPARISON OF EASTERN AND WESTERN APPROACHES TO YOGA.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
17  541  27 COMPONENTS AND REPORTING OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS: A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS. OBJECTIVES: TO IDENTIFY THE CONTENT AND REPORTING DETAILS OF RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS OF YOGA FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS THROUGH A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE. DESIGN: TWENTY ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE SEARCHED TO IDENTIFY RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS FOR MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA WERE FULL-TEXT, PEER REVIEWED ARTICLES, OF RCTS WITH YOGA AS A PRIMARY INTERVENTION, ON A POPULATION AGED 18 YEARS AND OVER, WITH A CLINICAL DIAGNOSIS OF A MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITION. DATA RELATING TO STUDY CHARACTERISTICS, YOGA STYLES, YOGA PRACTICES, HOME PRACTICE, AND REPORTING WERE EXTRACTED AND SUMMARISED. RESULTS: SEVENTEEN ARTICLES MET INCLUSION CRITERIA, REPRESENTING FIVE MUSCULOSKELETAL CONDITIONS: LOW BACK PAIN, OSTEOARTHRITIS, RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, KYPHOSIS, AND FIBROMYALGIA. 15 STUDIES WERE NON-RESIDENTIAL, AND TWO WERE RESIDENTIAL. STUDY DURATION RANGED FROM 1 TO 24 WEEKS; WEEKLY DOSAGE OF YOGA RANGED FROM 1 TO 56H. FIVE STYLES OF POSTURE-BASED HATHA YOGA WERE SPECIFIED. INTERVENTION CONTENT INCLUDED SEVEN YOGA PRACTISES: POSTURES, BREATHING, RELAXATION, MEDITATION, PHILOSOPHY, CHANTING, AND CLEANSING PRACTISES. TEN STUDIES EITHER ENCOURAGED OR REQUESTED HOME PRACTICE. REPORTING DETAILS INCLUDED CLASS PLANS, POSTURE LISTS, AND DIAGRAMS. DUE TO INSUFFICIENT DETAIL REGARDING DELIVERY OF THE YOGA INTERVENTION ONLY EIGHT OF THE 17 INTERVENTIONS WERE CONSIDERED REPLICABLE AS REPORTED. CONCLUSIONS: EVALUATION OF STUDY CHARACTERISTICS AND YOGA COMPONENTS INDICATED SEVERAL AREAS OF HOMOGENEITY ACROSS STUDIES, SUGGESTING AN EXISTING DEGREE OF STANDARDISATION. HOWEVER, HETEROGENEITY RELATED TO INTERVENTION CONTENT AND REPORTING IMPEDED DETERMINATION OF INTERVENTION CONTENT AND DELIVERY. STANDARDISATION OF CONTENT, NOMENCLATURE, AND REPORTING DETAILS IS RECOMMENDED TO ENHANCE PROTOCOL TRANSPARENCY, REPLICATION, AND COMPARISON OF INTERVENTION EFFECTIVENESS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
18 2578  25 YOGA FOR HEALTH CARE IN KOREA: A PROTOCOL FOR SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF CLINICAL TRIALS. THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AIMS TO EVALUATE THE THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF YOGA THERAPY USING AN EVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH AND INVESTIGATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN YOGA AND THE MERIDIAN ENERGIES BASED ON ALL AVAILABLE CLINICAL STUDIES IN KOREA. SIXTEEN ELECTRONIC DATABASES WILL BE SEARCHED FROM THE INCEPTION OF THE STUDY UNTIL JANUARY 2016. ALL CLINICAL EVIDENCES THAT EVALUATE ANY TYPE OF YOGA AND ANY TYPE OF CONTROL IN INDIVIDUALS WITH ANY TYPE OF CONDITION WILL BE ELIGIBLE. THE METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY WILL BE ASSESSED USING THE COCHRANE RISK OF BIAS TOOL FOR RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIALS AND THE NEWCASTLE-OTTAWA SCALE FOR NONRANDOMIZED STUDIES. TWO AUTHORS WILL INDEPENDENTLY ASSESS EACH STUDY FOR ELIGIBILITY AND THE RISK OF BIAS, AND THEN THEY WILL EXTRACT THE DATA. WITH ITS EXTENSIVE, UNBIASED SEARCH OF THE KOREAN LITERATURE FROM VARIOUS DATABASES WITHOUT ANY LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS, THIS SYSTEMATIC REVIEW WILL BE USEFUL FOR BOTH PRACTITIONERS IN THE FIELD OF YOGA RESEARCH AS WELL AS FOR PATIENTS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
19 2465  28 YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION: A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS OF PUBLISHED RESEARCH STUDIES FROM 1967 TO 2013. OBJECTIVE: A COMPREHENSIVE BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED ON PUBLICATIONS FOR YOGA THERAPY RESEARCH IN CLINICAL POPULATIONS. METHODS: MAJOR ELECTRONIC DATABASES WERE SEARCHED FOR ARTICLES IN ALL LANGUAGES PUBLISHED BETWEEN 1967 AND 2013. DATABASES INCLUDED PUBMED, PSYCHINFO, MEDLINE, INDMED, INDIAN CITATION INDEX, INDEX MEDICUS FOR SOUTH-EAST ASIA REGION, WEB OF KNOWLEDGE, EMBASE, EBSCO, AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR. NONINDEXED JOURNALS WERE SEARCHED MANUALLY. KEY SEARCH WORDS INCLUDED YOGA, YOGA THERAPY, PRANAYAMA, ASANA. ALL STUDIES MET THE DEFINITION OF A CLINICAL TRIAL. ALL STYLES OF YOGA WERE INCLUDED. THE AUTHORS EXTRACTED THE DATA. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 486 ARTICLES MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA AND WERE PUBLISHED IN 217 DIFFERENT PEER-REVIEWED JOURNALS FROM 29 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES ON 28,080 STUDY PARTICIPANTS. THE PRIMARY RESULT OBSERVED IS THE THREE-FOLD INCREASE IN NUMBER OF PUBLICATIONS SEEN IN THE LAST 10 YEARS, INCLUSIVE OF ALL STUDY DESIGNS. OVERALL, 45% OF THE STUDIES PUBLISHED WERE RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS, 18% WERE CONTROLLED STUDIES, AND 37% WERE UNCONTROLLED STUDIES. MOST PUBLICATIONS ORIGINATED FROM INDIA (N=258), FOLLOWED BY THE UNITED STATES (N=122) AND CANADA (N=13). THE TOP THREE DISORDERS ADDRESSED BY YOGA INTERVENTIONS WERE MENTAL HEALTH, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, AND RESPIRATORY DISEASE. CONCLUSION: A SURGE IN PUBLICATIONS ON YOGA TO MITIGATE DISEASE-RELATED SYMPTOMS IN CLINICAL POPULATIONS HAS OCCURRED DESPITE CHALLENGES FACING THE FIELD OF YOGA RESEARCH, WHICH INCLUDE STANDARDIZATION AND LIMITATIONS IN FUNDING, TIME, AND RESOURCES. THE POPULATION AT LARGE HAS OBSERVED A PARALLEL SURGE IN THE USE OF YOGA OUTSIDE OF CLINICAL PRACTICE. THE USE OF YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY IN CLINICAL PRACTICE MAY LEAD TO HEALTH BENEFITS BEYOND TRADITIONAL TREATMENT ALONE; HOWEVER, TO EFFECT CHANGES IN HEALTH CARE POLICY, MORE HIGH-QUALITY, EVIDENCE-BASED RESEARCH IS NEEDED.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
20 2569  39 YOGA FOR DEPRESSION: THE RESEARCH EVIDENCE. BACKGROUND: YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS MAY PROVE TO BE AN ATTRACTIVE OPTION FOR THE TREATMENT OF DEPRESSION. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEW THE RESEARCH EVIDENCE ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF YOGA FOR THIS INDICATION. METHODS: SEARCHES OF THE MAJOR BIOMEDICAL DATABASES INCLUDING MEDLINE, EMBASE, CLNAHL, PSYCINFO AND THE COCHRANE LIBRARY WERE CONDUCTED. SPECIALIST COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE (CAM) AND THE INDMED DATABASES WERE ALSO SEARCHED AND EFFORTS MADE TO IDENTIFY UNPUBLISHED AND ONGOING RESEARCH. SEARCHES WERE CONDUCTED BETWEEN JANUARY AND JUNE 2004. RELEVANT RESEARCH WAS CATEGORISED BY STUDY TYPE AND APPRAISED. CLINICAL COMMENTARIES WERE OBTAINED FOR STUDIES REPORTING CLINICAL OUTCOMES. RESULTS: FIVE RANDOMISED CONTROLLED TRIALS WERE LOCATED, EACH OF WHICH UTILISED DIFFERENT FORMS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS AND IN WHICH THE SEVERITY OF THE CONDITION RANGED FROM MILD TO SEVERE. ALL TRIALS REPORTED POSITIVE FINDINGS BUT METHODOLOGICAL DETAILS SUCH AS METHOD OF RANDOMISATION, COMPLIANCE AND ATTRITION RATES WERE MISSING. NO ADVERSE EFFECTS WERE REPORTED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF FATIGUE AND BREATHLESSNESS IN PARTICIPANTS IN ONE STUDY. LIMITATIONS: NO LANGUAGE RESTRICTIONS WERE IMPOSED ON THE SEARCHES CONDUCTED BUT NO SEARCHES OF DATABASES IN LANGUAGES OTHER THAN ENGLISH WERE INCLUDED. CONCLUSIONS: OVERALL, THE INITIAL INDICATIONS ARE OF POTENTIALLY BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS ON DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS. VARIATION IN INTERVENTIONS, SEVERITY AND REPORTING OF TRIAL METHODOLOGY SUGGESTS THAT THE FINDINGS MUST BE INTERPRETED WITH CAUTION. SEVERAL OF THE INTERVENTIONS MAY NOT BE FEASIBLE IN THOSE WITH REDUCED OR IMPAIRED MOBILITY. NEVERTHELESS, FURTHER INVESTIGATION OF YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION IS WARRANTED.	2005

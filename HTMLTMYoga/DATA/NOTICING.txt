1 1225 151 FEASIBILITY AND EFFECTS OF A CHAIR-BASED YOGA PROGRAM FOR ADULTS WITH NEURODISABILITY. PURPOSE: THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON EXPLORING THE FEASIBILITY AND THE EFFECTS OF PRACTICING CHAIR-BASED YOGA FOR 10 WEEKS ON HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) AND INTEROCEPTIVE BODY AWARENESS (BA) IN ADULTS WITH NEURODISABILITY AND MODERATE TO SEVERE PHYSICAL DEPENDENCE.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A PRE- AND POST-TESTING CONTROL GROUP DESIGN WAS FOLLOWED. PARTICIPANTS WERE 34 SERVICE USERS AT A REHABILITATION CENTER. THE INTERVENTION GROUP (IG, N = 17, 53% MEN, MEAN AGE OF 48.6 +/- 11.4 YEARS) TOOK PART IN THE 10-WEEK CHAIR-BASED YOGA PROGRAM. THE CONTROL GROUP (CG, N = 17, 53% MEN, MEAN AGE OF 53.1 +/- 11.0 YEARS) RECEIVED USUAL CARE. THE OUTCOME MEASURES WERE FEASIBILITY (RECRUITMENT RATE, ATTRITION, COMPLETION RATE, ADHERENCE, PARTICIPATION, SAFETY AND TOLERABILITY), HRQOL (WHOQOL-BREF QUESTIONNAIRE), AND BA (THE MULTIDIMENSIONAL ASSESSMENT OF INTEROCEPTIVE AWARENESS, MAIA). PARTICIPANTS IN THE IG COMPLETED A QUESTIONNAIRE TO MEASURE THEIR PERSONAL EXPERIENCE OF PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY PROVIDES IMPLICATIONS FOR A 10-WEEK CHAIR-BASED YOGA PROGRAM AS A FEASIBLE, WELL-TOLERATED, AND SAFE INTERVENTION, REINFORCED BY THE PARTICIPANTS' RETROSPECTIVE JUDGMENT. COMPARED TO THE CG, THE PROGRAM PRODUCED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS OVER BA, SUCH AS SUBSCALES OF MAIA NOTICING (P = .031, HEDGES GS = 0.76), EMOTIONAL AWARENESS (P < .001, HEDGES GS = 1.68), AND TRUSTING (P = .036, HEDGES GS = 0.74), BUT NOT HRQOL, FOR THE IG. CHAIR-BASED YOGA PROGRAMS COULD BE A REHABILITATION STRATEGY IN THE SOCIO-HEALTH CARE OF A VARIED POPULATION WITH PHYSICAL MOBILITY IMPAIRMENTS LEADING TO WHEELCHAIR USE.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONA 10-WEEK CHAIR-BASED YOGA INTERVENTION WAS SHOWN TO BE A FEASIBLE, WELL-TOLERATED, AND SAFE THERAPY WHICH ALLOWED PEOPLE OF VARYING ABILITIES TO PARTICIPATE EQUITABLE.CHAIR-BASED YOGA CAN HELP PEOPLE WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE PHYSICAL DEPENDENCE DUE TO NEURODISABILITY TO IMPROVE THEIR INTEROCEPTIVE BODY AWARENESS.CHAIR-BASED YOGA DOES NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE OF THIS SAMPLE OF PARTICIPANTS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
2 2125  18 THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TAI CHI, YOGA, MEDITATION, AND REIKI HEALING SESSIONS IN PROMOTING HEALTH AND ENHANCING PROBLEM SOLVING ABILITIES OF REGISTERED NURSES. GIVEN THE CURRENT NECESSITY OF RETAINING QUALIFIED NURSES, A SELF-CARE PROGRAM CONSISTING OF YOGA, TAI CHI, MEDITATION CLASSES, AND REIKI HEALING SESSIONS WAS DESIGNED FOR A UNIVERSITY-BASED HOSPITAL. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE INTERVENTIONS WAS EVALUATED USING SELF-CARE JOURNALS AND ANALYZED USING A HEIDEGGERIAN PHENOMENOLOGICAL APPROACH. OUTCOMES OF THE SELF-CARE CLASSES DESCRIBED BY NURSES INCLUDED: (A) NOTICING SENSATIONS OF WARMTH, TINGLING, AND PULSATION WHICH WERE RELAXING, (B) BECOMING AWARE OF AN ENHANCED PROBLEM SOLVING ABILITY, AND (C) NOTICING AN INCREASED ABILITY TO FOCUS ON PATIENT NEEDS. HOSPITALS WILLING TO INVEST IN SELF-CARE OPTIONS FOR NURSES CAN ANTICIPATE PATIENT AND WORK RELATED BENEFITS.	2007

THIS PILOT STUDY EXAMINED WHETHER CHAIR YOGA AND CHAIR-BASED EXERCISE ARE EFFECTIVE IN MANAGING BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL OUTCOMES FOR OLDER ADULTS WITH LOWER EXTREMITY OSTEOARTHRITIS. BOTH INTERVENTIONS IMPROVED PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND MOBILITY OVER TIME, ALTHOUGH NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 2 INTERVENTIONS WERE IDENTIFIED.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
4 2028  37 TAI CHI AND YOGA IN RESIDENTIAL AGED CARE: PERSPECTIVES OF PARTICIPANTS: A QUALITATIVE STUDY. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY EXAMINED THE APPROPRIATENESS AND ACCEPTABILITY OF 14-WEEK MODIFIED TAI CHI AND YOGA PROGRAMMES IN AN AUSTRALIAN RESIDENTIAL AGED CARE (RAC) SETTING BY EXPLORING EXPERIENCES AND PERSPECTIVES OF FRAIL OLDER RESIDENTS AND STAFF PARTICIPANTS. BACKGROUND: OLDER PERSONS IN RAC HAVE LIMITED OPPORTUNITIES FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. TAI CHI AND YOGA ARE MINDFULNESS-BASED EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN USED TO PROMOTE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH OF OLDER ADULTS IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS. WHILE RESEARCH ON TAI CHI AND YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN COMMUNITY SETTINGS IS PROMISING, THERE IS LIMITED RESEARCH REGARDING THE INTERVENTIONS' APPROPRIATENESS AND ACCEPTABILITY FOR FRAIL OLDER RESIDENTS IN RESIDENTIAL CARE SETTINGS IN AUSTRALIA. DESIGN: DESCRIPTIVE AND QUALITATIVE COMPONENT OF A MIXED-METHODS STUDY. METHODS: ALL RESIDENTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE MODIFIED YOGA AND TAI CHI INTERVENTIONS AND STAFF WHO SUPPORTED THEM WERE INVITED. A TOTAL OF 19 INDIVIDUALS COMPRISING 16 RESIDENTS AND THREE STAFF MEMBERS PARTICIPATED IN THREE FOCUS GROUP INTERVIEWS. THE INTERVIEWS WERE AUDIO-RECORDED, TRANSCRIBED AND ANALYSED THEMATICALLY USING A QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTIVE APPROACH. RESULTS: NINE THEMES THAT REFLECTED THE UNIQUENESS OF THE PROGRAMMES' MIND-BODY APPROACH ARE PRESENTED: (A) NOVEL, NEW AND EXCITING; (B) SMOOTHNESS, RHYTHM AND FLOW; (C) SLOW AND MINDFUL; (D) GENTLE BUT REWARDING; (E) MOVING WHOLE BODY; (F) PERCEIVED BENEFITS; (G) WORTHWHILE; (H) FEELING ALIVE; AND (I) CALMING AND RELAXING. CONCLUSIONS: THE MODIFIED PROGRAMMES OF TAI CHI AND YOGA WAS ACCEPTABLE, APPROPRIATE, ENJOYABLE AND HELPFUL. BOTH TAI CHI AND YOGA APPEAR TO PROVIDE APPROPRIATE PHYSICAL EXERCISE AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR OLDER PERSONS TO ENHANCE THEIR QUALITY OF LIFE THROUGH INTERACTION OF PHYSICAL, EMOTIONAL AND INTELLECTUAL WELLNESS DOMAINS. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: THE 14-WEEK MODIFIED PROGRAMMES OF TAI CHI AND YOGA COULD BE APPLIED TO FRAIL OLDER RAC POPULATION TO PROMOTE HEALTH AND ACTIVE AGEING.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
5 2602  33 YOGA FOR PATIENTS WITH EARLY BREAST CANCER AND ITS IMPACT ON QUALITY OF LIFE - A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. THE AIM OF THIS PROSPECTIVE, RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED TRIAL WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON NEWLY DIAGNOSED PATIENTS WITH EARLY BREAST CANCER IN THE IMMEDIATE POSTOPERATIVE PHASE. 93 WOMEN NEWLY DIAGNOSED WITH EARLY BREAST CANCER WERE RANDOMIZED INTO AN INTERVENTION GROUP (IG) AND A CONTROL GROUP (WAITING GROUP, WG). THE IG STARTED YOGA IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE OPERATION. THE WG STARTED YOGA 5 WEEKS AFTER SURGERY. BOTH GROUPS ATTENDED YOGA CLASSES TWICE WEEKLY FOR 5 WEEKS. QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) WAS EVALUATED USING THE EORTC QLQ-C30 AND EORTC QLQ-BR23 QUESTIONNAIRES BEFORE THE INTERVENTION, IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE OPERATION AND AFTER 3 MONTHS. AFTER 3 MONTHS THE PATIENTS WERE ASKED WHETHER YOGA IMPROVED THEIR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND WHETHER THEY WISHED TO CONTINUE WITH YOGA. THE OVERALL QOL (P = 0.002) AND THE FUNCTIONAL STATUS (P = 0.005) INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE IG, WHILE PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS DECREASED OVER TIME IN BOTH GROUPS. 86 % OF PATIENTS IN THE IG AND ONLY 59 % OF PATIENTS IN THE WG (P = 0.04) CONFIRMED A POSITIVE CHANGE IN THEIR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY THROUGH YOGA. MORE WOMEN IN THE IG INTENDED TO CONTINUE WITH YOGA (P = 0.03). EARLY INITIATION OF YOGA AS A SUPPORTIVE TREATMENT IN CANCER HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON QOL. TEACHING YOGA ALLOWED PATIENTS TO PRACTICE YOGA BY THEMSELVES, ENHANCED THE PATIENTS' QOL AND WAS FOUND TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY.	2013

THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS FEASIBILITY AND CHANGES IN OUTCOME MEASURES FOLLOWING THE MERGING YOGA AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE (MY-OT FOR PD) PROGRAM: A 14-SESSION PROGRAM WHICH COMBINED COMMUNITY-BASED YOGA FOR PD, AND FALL-RISK FOCUSED GROUP OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY SESSIONS. SEVENTEEN PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED AN 8-WEEK CONTROL PERIOD CONSISTING OF THEIR NORMAL PARTICIPATION, AND AN 8-WEEK INTERVENTION PERIOD (14 MY-OT FOR PD SESSIONS). THERE WERE FEWER SELF-REPORTED FALLS IN THE INTERVENTION (6) VS. CONTROL PERIODS (10). ONE FALL RISK FACTOR MANAGEMENT SCALE (THE FALL PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT QUESTIONNAIRE, P=.02), AND BALANCE (P<.01) SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT BETWEEN THE CONTROL AND INTERVENTION. THE MY-OT FOR PD PROGRAM IS AN ENCOURAGING OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIST-LED PROGRAM, WHICH MAY IMPROVE BALANCE AND REDUCE SELF-REPORTED FALLS.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
8 1974  33 SILVER YOGA EXERCISES IMPROVED PHYSICAL FITNESS OF TRANSITIONAL FRAIL ELDERS. BACKGROUND: PROMOTING THE HEALTH OF TRANSITIONAL FRAIL ELDERS (E.G., THROUGH THERAPEUTIC-BASED YOGA EXERCISES) IS ESSENTIAL TO REDUCE HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES CAUSED BY CHRONIC HEALTH PROBLEMS. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFICACY OF 24 WEEKS OF THE SENIOR-TAILORED SILVER YOGA (SY) EXERCISE PROGRAM FOR TRANSITIONAL FRAIL ELDERS. METHODS: A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF 69 ELDERS IN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES WERE ASSIGNED RANDOMLY TO THE SY GROUP (N = 38) OR TO THE CONTROL GROUP (N = 31) ON THE BASIS OF THE FACILITIES WHERE THEY RESIDED, AND 55 OF THEM COMPLETED THIS QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL PRETEST AND POSTTEST STUDY. INTERVENTION WAS CONDUCTED THREE TIMES PER WEEK, 70 MINUTES PER SESSION, FOR 24 WEEKS. PHYSICAL FITNESS (BODY COMPOSITION, CARDIOVASCULAR-RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS, BODY FLEXIBILITY, MUSCLE POWER AND ENDURANCE, BALANCE, AND AGILITY) WERE EXAMINED AT BASELINE, AT 12 WEEKS, AND AT THE END OF THE 24TH WEEK OF THE STUDY. RESULTS: AT THE END OF THE STUDY, THE PHYSICAL FITNESS INDICATORS OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE SY GROUP HAD IMPROVED SIGNIFICANTLY, AND THEY HAD BETTER PHYSICAL FITNESS THAN PARTICIPANTS IN THE CONTROL GROUP (ALL P VALUES < .05). DISCUSSION: IT WAS RECOMMENDED THAT THE SY EXERCISES BE INCORPORATED AS AN ACTIVITY PROGRAM IN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES TO PROMOTE THE PHYSICAL FITNESS OF TRANSITIONAL FRAIL ELDERS.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
9 1234  40 FEASIBILITY AND RESULTS OF A CASE STUDY OF YOGA TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING IN PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY. PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS MIXED-METHODS CASE STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER AN 8-WEEK 1:1 YOGA PROGRAM WAS FEASIBLE AND BENEFICIAL TO PEOPLE WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI). METHOD: THIS WAS A MIXED-METHODS CASE STUDY OF ONE-TO-ONE YOGA FOR PEOPLE WITH TBI INCLUDED THREE PEOPLE. WE COMPLETED ASSESSMENTS BEFORE AND AFTER THE 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION AND INCLUDED MEASURES OF BALANCE, BALANCE CONFIDENCE, PAIN, RANGE OF MOTION, STRENGTH AND MOBILITY. QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS WERE INCLUDED AT THE POST-ASSESSMENT. WE INCLUDE A PERCENT CHANGE CALCULATION AND SALIENT QUOTES THAT REPRESENT THE PERCEIVED IMPACT OF THE YOGA INTERVENTION. RESULTS: ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE YOGA INTERVENTION AND ALL DEMONSTRATED IMPROVEMENTS IN PHYSICAL OUTCOME MEASURES. FOR THE GROUP, BALANCE INCREASED BY 36%, BALANCE CONFIDENCE BY 39%, LOWER EXTREMITY STRENGTH BY 100% AND ENDURANCE BY 105%. QUALITATIVE DATA SUPPORT THE USE OF YOGA TO IMPROVE MULTIPLE ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING, ONE PARTICIPANT STATED: "I MEAN IT'S ROCKED MY WORLD. IT'S CHANGED MY LIFE. I MEAN ALL THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS. I MEAN PHYSICALLY, EMOTIONALLY, MENTALLY, IT'S GIVEN ME YOU KNOW MY LIFE BACK...". CONCLUSIONS: YOGA, DELIVERED IN A ONE-TO-ONE SETTING, APPEARS TO BE FEASIBLE AND BENEFICIAL TO PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC TBI. IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATION: CHRONIC TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY (TBI) LEADS TO MANY ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING IMPAIRMENT. YOGA DELIVERED IN A ONE-TO-ONE SETTING MAY BE FEASIBLE AND BENEFICIAL FOR PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC TBI.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
10  666  36 EFFECT OF A 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION ON FEAR OF FALLING AND BALANCE IN OLDER ADULTS: A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO DETERMINE WHETHER FEAR OF FALLING (FOF) AND BALANCE IMPROVED AFTER A 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION AMONG OLDER ADULTS. DESIGN: A 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION SINGLE-ARMED PILOT STUDY. SETTING: A RETIREMENT COMMUNITY IN A MEDIUM-SIZED UNIVERSITY TOWN IN THE MIDWEST. PARTICIPANTS: A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF ADULTS (N=14) OVER THE AGE OF 65 YEARS WHO ALL ENDORSED AN FOF. INTERVENTION: EACH PARTICIPANT TOOK PART IN A BIWEEKLY 12-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION. THE YOGA SESSIONS INCLUDED BOTH PHYSICAL POSTURES AND BREATHING EXERCISES. POSTURES WERE COMPLETED IN SITTING AND STANDING POSITIONS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: WE MEASURED FOF WITH THE ILLINOIS FOF MEASURE AND BALANCE WITH THE BERG BALANCE SCALE. UPPER- AND LOWER-BODY FLEXIBILITY WERE MEASURED WITH THE BACK SCRATCH TEST AND CHAIR SIT AND REACH TEST, RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS: FOF DECREASED BY 6%, STATIC BALANCE INCREASED BY 4% (P=.045), AND LOWER-BODY FLEXIBILITY INCREASED BY 34%. CONCLUSIONS: THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT YOGA MAY BE A PROMISING INTERVENTION TO MANAGE FOF AND IMPROVE BALANCE, THEREBY REDUCING FALL RISK FOR OLDER ADULTS. REHABILITATION THERAPISTS MAY WISH TO EXPLORE YOGA AS A MODALITY FOR BALANCE AND FALLS PROGRAMMING; HOWEVER, FUTURE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO CONFIRM THE USE OF YOGA IN SUCH PROGRAMMING.	2010

SETTING: THE YOGA CLASS WAS PERFORMED AT A LOCAL CONTINUING CARE RETIREMENT COMMUNITY. ALL TESTING WAS PERFORMED AT THE SITE. CONTROL-SUBJECT PRETESTS AND POSTTESTS WERE PERFORMED AT A SECOND CONTINUING CARE RETIREMENT COMMUNITY. PARTICIPANTS: EIGHT RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS, ALL WOMEN, WITH A MEAN AGE OF 84 (4.6) YEARS, 8 CONTROL PARTICIPANTS, 5 WOMEN AND 3 MEN, AGED 81.3 (4.9) YEARS. RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS WERE NAIVE TO YOGA. INTERVENTIONS: AN 8-WEEK, 80-MINUTE, BIWEEKLY KRIPALU YOGA CLASS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR COMMUNITY-DWELLING OLDER ADULTS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: POSTURAL CONTROL (BERG BALANCE SCALE), MOBILITY (TIME TO RISE FROM THE FLOOR TO STANDING, TIMED UP AND GO), GAIT (USUAL AND FAST GAIT SPEED), AND BALANCE CONFIDENCE (ACTIVITIES-SPECIFIC BALANCE SCALE). RESULTS: ALL SUBJECTS ATTENDED AT LEAST 10 OF THE 16 CLASSES (62% ATTENDANCE). POSTTEST DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND FOR YOGA PARTICIPANTS IN BALANCE SCORES (P < .003) AND FAST WALKING SPEED (P < .031). NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE NOTED. CONCLUSIONS: IMPROVEMENTS IN POSTURAL CONTROL AS MEASURED BY THE BERG BALANCE SCALE AND GAIT AS MEASURED BY FAST GAIT SPEED INDICATE THAT RESEARCH SUBJECTS BENEFITED FROM THE YOGA INTERVENTION. THE YOGA PROGRAM DESIGNED FOR THIS STUDY INCLUDED THE ACTIVITIES OF STANDING, SITTING, AND LYING ON THE FLOOR. THEREFORE, SUBJECTS PERFORM ACTIVITIES DURING YOGA THAT CAN IMPROVE POSTURAL CONTROL, MOBILITY, AND GAIT SPEED.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
12  502  32 COMMUNITY VS. INSTITUTIONAL ELDERS' EVALUATIONS OF AND PREFERENCES FOR YOGA EXERCISES. AIMS: TO EVALUATE AND COMPARE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THE SILVER YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAMME FOR COMMUNITY AND INSTITUTIONAL ELDERS AND TO DETERMINE THEIR PREFERENCES TOWARDS YOGA EXERCISES. BACKGROUND: YOGA HAS BEEN USED TO PROMOTE THE HEALTH OF ELDERS. THE SILVER YOGA WAS DEVELOPED TO ACCOMMODATE THE PHYSICAL TOLERANCE AND BODY FLEXIBILITY OF ELDERS AND APPLIED TO COMMUNITY AND INSTITUTIONAL ELDERS WITH POSITIVE HEALTH PROMOTION BENEFITS. DESIGN: DESCRIPTIVE DESIGN WITH QUANTITATIVE PROGRAMME EVALUATION AND SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS. METHOD: A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF 97 PARTICIPANTS (64 COMMUNITY ELDERS; 33 INSTITUTIONAL ELDERS) WAS INTERVIEWED INDIVIDUALLY AFTER SIX MONTHS OF SILVER YOGA EXERCISES. PARTICIPANTS RATED THE LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY, ACCEPTABILITY, FEASIBILITY AND HELPFULNESS OF THE SILVER YOGA PROGRAMME (FOUR PHASES: WARM-UP, HATHA YOGA, RELAXATION AND GUIDED-IMAGERY MEDITATION) AND THE ABDOMINAL BREATHING TECHNIQUE, BASED ON A 10-POINT CANTRIL LADDER SCALE. FURTHER, PARTICIPANTS EXPRESSED THEIR PREFERENCES OF YOGA EXERCISES BASED ON FOUR OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS. RESULTS: THE PROGRAMME WAS FAIRLY ACCEPTABLE, FEASIBLE AND HELPFUL FOR COMMUNITY AND INSTITUTIONAL ELDERS (MEANS RANGED FROM 8.33-9.70). THE WARM-UP, RELAXATION, GUIDED-IMAGERY MEDITATION AND ABDOMINAL BREATHING ARE FAIRLY EASY TO FOLLOW AND PERFORM (MEANS RANGED FROM 0.20-0.94). HOWEVER, THE POSTURES IN HATHA YOGA PHASE WERE RELATIVELY CHALLENGING BUT STILL MANAGEABLE FOR THE INSTITUTIONAL ELDERS (MEAN = 1.97, SD 2.33). FURTHER, COMMUNITY ELDERS PREFERRED TO PRACTISE YOGA 61-90 MINUTES EVERYDAY IN A GROUP OF 11-20, WHILE THE INSTITUTIONAL ELDERS PREFERRED TO PRACTISE YOGA 31-60 MINUTES THREE TIMES PER WEEK, IN A GROUP OF <10. CONCLUSIONS: THE SILVER YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAMME IS ACCEPTABLE, FEASIBLE, HELPFUL AND MANAGEABLE FOR COMMUNITY AND INSTITUTIONAL ELDERS. HOWEVER, DIFFERENT EXERCISE PROTOCOLS, SUCH AS PRACTICE INTENSITY AND GROUP SIZE, COULD BE APPLIED TO DIFFERENT OLDER POPULATIONS. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: THE SILVER YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAMME COULD BE APPLIED TO BOTH COMMUNITY AND INSTITUTIONAL ELDERS TO PROMOTE THEIR HEALTH.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
13 1716  23 PERCEIVED RELAXATION AS A FUNCTION OF RESTORATIVE YOGA COMBINED WITH REIKI FOR CANCER SURVIVORS. AIMS & OBJECTIVES: TWENTY-SIX CANCER SURVIVOR VOLUNTEERS PARTICIPATED IN A STUDY OF THE EFFICACY OF PERCEIVED RELAXATION AFTER PERFORMING RESTORATIVE YOGA COMBINED WITH REIKI. RESULTS: SUBJECTS SCORING HIGH RATINGS OF MEANING AND PEACE IN LIFE DEMONSTRATED GREATER PERCEPTION OF DEPTH OF RELAXATION. A COMPARISON OF SUBJECTS RECEIVING CONCURRENT REIKI (19) AND RESTORATIVE YOGA WITH THOSE WHO ONLY RECEIVED RESTORATIVE YOGA (7) SHOWED THAT REIKI SUBJECTS EXPERIENCED GREATER PERCEIVED DEPTH OF RELAXATION THAN SUBJECTS WHO WERE NOT AFFORDED THE REIKI INTERVENTION. NON-REIKI PARTICIPANTS ALSO SHOWED MORE DIFFICULTY OVERCOMING INTRUSIVE FEARFUL THOUGHTS THAN THE REIKI GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS SUGGEST THAT PATIENTS SHOULD BE SCREENED AND TREATED FOR TRAUMA-LIKE SYMPTOMS INCLUDING INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS LINKED TO ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION BEFORE REFERRAL TO COMPLEMENTARY PROGRAMS THAT OFFER MEDITATIVE OR RELAXATION INTERVENTIONS.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
14 1437  26 INCORPORATING YOGA INTO AN INTENSE PHYSICAL THERAPY PROGRAM IN SOMEONE WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE: A CASE REPORT. PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS CASE REPORT WAS TO DOCUMENT OUTCOMES FOLLOWING AN INTENSE EXERCISE PROGRAM INTEGRATING YOGA WITH PHYSICAL THERAPY EXERCISE IN A MALE WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE. METHOD: THE PARTICIPANT PERFORMED AN INTENSE 1(1/2)-HOUR PROGRAM (PHASE A) INCORPORATING STRENGTHENING, BALANCE, AGILITY AND YOGA EXERCISES TWICE WEEKLY FOR 12 WEEKS. HE THEN COMPLETED A NEW HOME EXERCISE PROGRAM DEVELOPED BY THE RESEARCHERS (PHASE B) FOR 12 WEEKS. RESULTS: HIS SCORE ON THE PARKINSON'S DISEASE QUESTIONNAIRE IMPROVED 16 POINTS WHILE HIS SCORE ON THE HIGH LEVEL MOBILITY ASSESSMENT TOOL IMPROVED 11 POINTS. THERE WERE ALSO IMPROVEMENTS IN MUSCLE LENGTH OF SEVERAL LOWER EXTREMITY MUSCLES, IN UPPER AND LOWER EXTREMITY MUSCLE STRENGTH, IN DYNAMIC BALANCE AND HE CONTINUES TO WORK FULL TIME 29 MONTHS LATER. THERE WERE NO IMPROVEMENTS IN THORACIC POSTURE OR AEROBIC POWER. DISCUSSION: THIS INTENSE PROGRAM WAS AN EFFECTIVE DOSE OF EXERCISE FOR SOMEONE WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE AND ALLOWED HIM TO CONTINUE TO PARTICIPATE IN WORK, LEISURE, AND COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES.	2013

16 1584  40 MEDICAL THERAPEUTIC YOGA FOR MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS: EXAMINING SELF-EFFICACY FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, MOTIVATION FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES. PURPOSE: MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS (MS) IS AN INCURABLE NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASE THAT RESULTS IN DEFICITS IN PHYSICAL AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION, AND OFTEN FOSTERS LOW LEVELS OF SELF-EFFICACY FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, MOTIVATION FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE [1]. DRUG THERAPIES, PHYSICAL THERAPY REHABILITATION, AND LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS SUCH AS INCREASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ARE STANDARD PROTOCOL FOR SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT, YET PERSONS WITH MS TEND TO BE PHYSICALLY INACTIVE [2,3]. ADDITIONALLY, SINGLE-MODALITY INTERVENTIONS DO NOT INHERENTLY ADDRESS THE CHALLENGES FACED CONCURRENTLY BY INDIVIDUALS WITH MS [4,5]. METHODS: THIS PROJECT EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF A 5-WEEK HOLISTIC BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL MEDICAL THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM ON PHYSICAL ACTIVITY BEHAVIOR OUTCOMES IN INDIVIDUALS DIAGNOSED WITH MS. A MIXED-METHODS APPROACH WAS USED TO EXAMINE SELF-EFFICACY FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, MOTIVATION FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES IN 15 PARTICIPANTS. RESULTS: QUANTITATIVE MEASURES DEMONSTRATED INCREASED SELF-EFFICACY (T(14) = -2.23, P = 0.042), AND EMOTIONAL QUALITY OF LIFE (T(14) = -2.66, P = 0.019). RESPONSES TO AN OPEN-ENDED WRITTEN QUESTIONNAIRE AND FOLLOW-UP INTERVIEWS INDICATED OVERALL POSITIVE RESPONSE TO THE PROGRAM INCLUDING INCREASES IN SELF-EFFICACY FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, MOTIVATION FOR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, AND QUALITY OF LIFE. THESE RESULTS MAY HELP FUTURE HOLISTIC PROGRAMMING FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH MS INCORPORATE BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS WITH THERAPEUTIC REHABILITATION TO INCREASE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ADHERENCE.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONMULTIPLE SCLEROSIS IS A NEUROLOGICAL DISEASE IMPACTING PHYSICAL AND COGNITIVE FUNCTIONING THAT MAY BE MANAGED WITH A COMBINATION OF DRUG THERAPIES, REHABILITATION, AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY.INDIVIDUALS DIAGNOSED WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS TEND TO BE PHYSICALLY INACTIVE AND PHYSICAL INACTIVITY IS A CHALLENGE FOR OPTIMAL DISEASE MANAGEMENT.MEDICAL THERAPEUTIC YOGA OFFERS AN INTERDISCIPLINARY BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL FRAMEWORK TO SIMULTANEOUSLY ADDRESS THE BEHAVIORAL CHALLENGES AND PHYSICAL IMPAIRMENTS FACING INDIVIDUALS DIAGNOSED WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS.HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS SHOULD CONSIDER DEVELOPING PROGRAMS THAT USE A BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL FRAMEWORK TO AID IN DEVELOPING LONG-TERM ADHERENCE IN HEALTH BEHAVIORS SUCH AS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY PARTICIPATION.	2022	

17 2077  32 THE EFFECT OF CHAIR YOGA IN OLDER ADULTS WITH MODERATE AND SEVERE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE. USING A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL SINGLE-GROUP DESIGN, THIS STUDY EXAMINED THE FEASIBILITY OF OLDER ADULTS WITH ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (AD)-TYPE DEMENTIA TO COMPLETE THE SIT 'N' FIT CHAIR YOGA PROGRAM. PHYSICAL FUNCTION OF PARTICIPANTS WHO COMPLETED THE PROGRAM WAS MEASURED. THE NINE OLDER ADULTS WITH AD (MEAN AGE = 83) PARTICIPATED IN THE 8-WEEK SIT 'N' FIT CHAIR YOGA PROGRAM. TO MEASURE PHYSICAL FUNCTION, THE SIX-MINUTE WALK TEST, THE GAIT SPEED TEST, AND THE BERG BALANCE SCALE WERE ADMINISTERED AT PRE-INTERVENTION, 4 WEEKS, 8 WEEKS, AND 1 MONTH AFTER PROGRAM COMPLETION. ALL PARTICIPANTS COMPLETED THE PROGRAM. POSITIVE CHANGES WERE SEEN ACROSS ALL PHYSICAL MEASURES. FURTHER STUDY, USING A LARGER SAMPLE AND INCLUDING A CONTROL GROUP, IS NEEDED TO FULLY DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF THE SIT 'N' FIT CHAIR YOGA PROGRAM ON OLDER ADULTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE AD.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
18  510  37 COMPARATIVE IMPACTS OF TAI CHI, BALANCE TRAINING, AND A SPECIALLY-DESIGNED YOGA PROGRAM ON BALANCE IN OLDER FALLERS. OBJECTIVE: TO COMPARE THE EFFECT OF A CUSTOM-DESIGNED YOGA PROGRAM WITH 2 OTHER BALANCE TRAINING PROGRAMS. DESIGN: RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: RESEARCH LABORATORY. PARTICIPANTS: A GROUP OF OLDER ADULTS (N=39; MEAN AGE, 74.15 +/- 6.99 Y) WITH A HISTORY OF FALLING. INTERVENTIONS: THREE DIFFERENT EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS (TAI CHI, STANDARD BALANCE TRAINING, YOGA) WERE GIVEN FOR 12 WEEKS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: BALANCE PERFORMANCE WAS EXAMINED DURING PRE- AND POSTTEST USING FIELD TESTS, INCLUDING THE 8-FOOT UP-AND-GO TEST, 1-LEG STANCE, FUNCTIONAL REACH, AND USUAL AND MAXIMAL WALKING SPEED. THE STATIC AND DYNAMIC BALANCES WERE ALSO ASSESSED BY POSTURAL SWAY AND DYNAMIC POSTUROGRAPHY, RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS: TRAINING PRODUCED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN ALL FIELD TESTS (P<.005), BUT GROUP DIFFERENCE AND TIME X GROUP INTERACTION WERE NOT DETECTED. FOR POSTURAL SWAY, SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN THE AREA OF THE CENTER OF PRESSURE WITH EYES OPEN (P=.001) AND EYES CLOSED (P=.002) WERE DETECTED AFTER TRAINING. FOR EYES OPEN, MAXIMUM MEDIAL-LATERAL VELOCITY SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED FOR THE SAMPLE (P=.013). FOR EYES CLOSED, MEDIAL-LATERAL DISPLACEMENT DECREASED FOR TAI CHI (P<.01). FOR DYNAMIC POSTUROGRAPHY, SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN OVERALL SCORE (P=.001), TIME ON THE TEST (P=.006), AND 2 LINEAR MEASURES IN LATERAL (P=.001) AND ANTERIOR-POSTERIOR (P<.001) DIRECTIONS WERE SEEN FOR THE SAMPLE. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA WAS AS EFFECTIVE AS TAI CHI AND STANDARD BALANCE TRAINING FOR IMPROVING POSTURAL STABILITY AND MAY OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE TO MORE TRADITIONAL PROGRAMS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
19 1314  31 HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE CHANGES AFTER THE MERGING YOGA AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE PROGRAM: A MIXED-METHODS STUDY. BACKGROUND: TO UNDERSTAND CHANGES IN HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (HRQOL) AFTER THE MERGING YOGA AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY FOR PARKINSON'S DISEASE (MY-OT FOR PD) PROGRAM. MATERIALS AND METHODS: WE USED A MIXED-METHODS CONVERGENT DESIGN AND ADMINISTERED THE PARKINSON'S DISEASE QUESTIONNAIRE-8 (PDQ-8), A MEASURE OF HRQOL, WITH 17 PARTICIPANTS. WE CONSIDERED SCORES 8 WEEKS BEFORE MY-OT FOR PD, JUST BEFORE, AND UPON COMPLETION. ADDITIONALLY, WE COMPLETED TWO FOCUS GROUPS FOLLOWING THE PROGRAM WITH 16 PARTICIPANTS TO ASSESS QUALITATIVE CHANGES IN HRQOL. RESULTS: THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN PDQ-8 SCORES BETWEEN TIME POINTS, F(2,32) = 1.60, P = 0.22, PARTIAL ETA(2) = 0.09. PARTICIPANTS DID DISCUSS IMPROVEMENTS IN ALL 8 HRQOL DOMAINS, FREQUENTLY REGARDING MOBILITY AND ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING. CONCLUSION: RESULTS DIVERGED, WITH QUANTITATIVE RESULTS SHOWING NO SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN HRQOL AND QUALITATIVE RESULTS INDICATING PARTICIPANT PERCEIVED IMPROVEMENTS IN ALL DOMAINS OF THE PDQ-8. THE PROGRAM SHOULD BE EXPLORED FURTHER, AND LONGITUDINAL FOLLOW-UP COMPLETED.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
20  902  40 EFFECTIVENESS OF A COMPREHENSIVE YOGA PROGRAM ON CONVICTED EXTREMIST OFFENDERS. OBJECTIVE: THE PRESENT STUDY AIMED TO EXPLORE THE EFFECT OF YOGA TECHNIQUES ON WELL-BEING AND BEHAVIOR AMONG THOSE WHO HAVE PROPAGATED AND PARTICIPATED IN EXTREME VIOLENCE AND AGGRESSION. THE SAMPLE COMPRISED 219 UNITED LIBERATION FRONT OF ASSAM MILITANTS SELECTED IMMEDIATELY AFTER SURRENDER OF ARMS IN THE YEAR 2012 FROM ALL OVER NORTHEAST REGION OF INDIA. METHODOLOGY: THE STUDY DESIGN WAS A SINGLE GROUP WITH PRE- AND POSTTEST ASSESSMENT. ALL PARTICIPANTS ATTENDED A 40-DAY INTENSIVE YOGA WORKSHOP (SUDARSHAN KRIYA YOGA, PRANAYAMA, PHYSICAL POSTURES OR HATHA YOGA, MEDITATION) CONDUCTED AT ART OF LIVING INTERNATIONAL CENTRE, BENGALURU. THE IMPACT OF SPIRITUAL PRACTICES WAS OBSERVED ON PEACE, AGGRESSION, LIFE SATISFACTION, AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN INDIVIDUALS USING THE AGGRESSION BUSS PERRY QUESTIONNAIRE, WHOQOL-BREF, AND SATISFACTION WITH LIFE SCALE. THE QUESTIONNAIRES WERE ADMINISTERED AT THE BEGINNING AND AT THE END OF THE 40-DAY WORKSHOP. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT RESULTS USING PAIRED T-TEST CLEARLY DEMONSTRATE THAT BY FOLLOWING YOGA TECHNIQUES (SUDARSHAN KRIYA, YOGA, AND MEDITATION), A REDUCTION IN AGGRESSION, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND LIFE SATISFACTION CAN BE OBTAINED. THESE PRACTICES CAN BE USEFUL FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT TO REHABILITATE THEMSELVES AFTER INCARCERATION OR EXPERIENCE OF MILITANCY. THE PURPOSE OF THESE MEASURES IS TO REDUCE THE RISK OF FUTURE CRIMINALITY BY THOSE ALREADY CONVICTED OF VIOLENT EXTREMIST OFFENSES, THEREBY PROTECTING PUBLIC SAFETY WHILE ALSO BENEFITING INDIVIDUALS AND COMMUNITIES.	2020

1 1706 98 PATTERN OF BREATHING AND VENTILATORY RESPONSE TO CO2 IN SUBJECTS PRACTICING HATHA-YOGA. WE STUDIED EIGHT BELGIAN SUBJECTS WELL ADVANCED IN THE PRACTICE OF HATHA-YOGA AND COMPARED THEM WITH EIGHT SEX-, AGE-, AND HEIGHT-MATCHED CONTROL SUBJECTS. PRACTICE OF YOGA (RANGE 4-12 YR) INVOLVES CONTROL OF POSTURE AND MANIPULATION OF BREATHING, INCLUDING SLOW NEAR-VITAL CAPACITY MANEUVERS ACCOMPANIED BY APNEA AT END INSPIRATION AND END EXPIRATION. AVERAGE VALUES FOR THE YOGA AND THE CONTROL GROUP (IN PARENTHESES) ARE AS FOLLOWS: VENTILATION (VE) 5.53 1 X MIN-1 (7.07); TIDAL VOLUME (VT), 1.03 LITERS (0.56); RATE OF BREATHING, 5.5 MIN-1 (13.4); END-TIDAL PCO2, 39.0 TORR (35.3). ALL DIFFERENCES ARE SIGNIFICANT (P LESS THAN 0.05). VENTILATORY RESPONSE TO CO2 (REBREATHING TECHNIQUE) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN THE YOGA GROUP (P LESS THAN 0.01). THE REGRESSION RELATING VE TO VT DURING REBREATHING OF CO2 WAS VE = 8.1 (VT - 0.23) FOR THE YOGA GROUP AND VE = 15.8 (VT - 0.16) FOR THE CONTROL GROUP (P LESS THAN 0.005). WE ATTRIBUTE THESE CHANGES TO CHRONIC MANIPULATION OF RESPIRATION.	1981	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
2 2232 19 THE IMPACT OF YOGA ON INSPIRATORY MUSCLE PERFORMANCE IN VETERANS WITH COPD: A PILOT STUDY. CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD) CAUSES RESPIRATORY MUSCLE WEAKNESS THAT LEADS TO DISABLING DYSPNEA AND POOR FUNCTIONAL PERFORMANCE. THERAPIES ARE OFTEN GEARED TO IMPROVE INSPIRATORY MUSCLE PERFORMANCE. YOGA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE EXERCISE CAPACITY, QUALITY OF LIFE, AND SOME PULMONARY FUNCTION MEASURES IN COPD, BUT LITTLE RESEARCH HAS EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF YOGA TRAINING ON INSPIRATORY MUSCLE PERFORMANCE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF YOGA TRAINING ON INSPIRATORY MUSCLE PERFORMANCE IN MILITARY VETERANS USING THE TEST OF INCREMENTAL RESPIRATORY ENDURANCE (TIRE). A PROSPECTIVE PILOT STUDY EXAMINED A 6-WEEK YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM CONSISTING OF ASANA (POSES) AND PRANAYAMA (CONTROLLED BREATHING). SUBJECTS HAD BASELINE INSPIRATORY MUSCLE WEAKNESS. THE TIRE MEASURED INSPIRATORY MUSCLE PERFORMANCE VIA THE PRO2 DEVICE, PROVIDING MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE, SUSTAINED MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE, AND INSPIRATORY DURATION. SECONDARY MEASURES INCLUDED 6-MINUTE WALK DISTANCE, ST. GEORGE RESPIRATORY QUESTIONNAIRE, HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE, AND SPIROMETRY. MEAN AGE AND BMI OF SUBJECTS WERE 67 +/- 3.6 YEARS AND 20.7 +/- 3.3, RESPECTIVELY. THE MAJORITY OF SUBJECTS HAD SEVERE (28.7%) OR VERY SEVERE (57.1%) COPD. STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVE M E N T S WERE SEEN IN MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE (39.0 +/- 14.1 CMH2O TO 56.4 +/- 20.6 CMH2O) AND SUSTAINED MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE (244.1 +/- 100.6 PTU TO 308.1 +/- 121.2 PTU). NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WE RE OBSERVED IN 6-MINUTE WALK DISTANCE, ST. GEORGE RESPIRATORY QUESTIONNAIRE, HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE, OR SPIROMETRY. YOGA TRAINING HAS THE POTENTIAL IN IMPROVE INSPIRATORY MUSCLE PERFORMANCE IN VETERANS WITH SEVERE TO VERY SEVERE COPD WHO PRESENT WITH INSPIRATORY MUSCLE WEAKNESS. THIS IS OF IMPORTANCE BECAUSE IMPROVING INSPIRA-TORY MUSCLE PERFORMANCE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE COPD OUTCOMES.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
3  880 23 EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON HANDGRIP, RESPIRATORY PRESSURES AND PULMONARY FUNCTION. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A NUMBER OF REPORTS ON THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS, VERY FEW STUDIES HAVE BEEN UNDERTAKEN ON THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON RESPIRATORY PRESSURES AND HANDGRIP ENDURANCE. HENCE THE PRESENT WORK WAS PLANNED TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON HAND GRIP STRENGTH (HGS), HAND GRIP ENDURANCE (HGE), MAXIMUM EXPIRATORY PRESSURE (MEP), MAXIMUM INSPIRATORY PRESSURE (MIP), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME (FEV), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN FIRST SECOND (FEV1) AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR). 20 SCHOOL CHILDREN IN THE AGE GROUP OF 12 TO 15 YEARS WERE GIVEN YOGA TRAINING (ASANS AND PRANAYAMS) FOR 6 MONTHS. 20 AGE AND GENDER-MATCHED STUDENTS FORMED THE CONTROL GROUP. YOGA TRAINING PRODUCED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.05) INCREASE IN HGS AND HGE. MEP, MIP, FEV, FEV1 AND PEFR ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (P < 0.001) AFTER THE YOGA TRAINING. IN CONTRAST, THE INCREASE IN THESE PARAMETERS IN THE CONTROL GROUP WAS STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT. OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT YOGA TRAINING FOR 6 MONTHS IMPROVES LUNG FUNCTION, STRENGTH OF INSPIRATORY AND EXPIRATORY MUSCLES AS WELL AS SKELETAL MUSCLE STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT YOGA BE INTRODUCED AT SCHOOL LEVEL IN ORDER TO IMPROVE PHYSIOLOGICAL FUNCTIONS, OVERALL HEALTH AND PERFORMANCE OF STUDENTS.	2003	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
4  438 25 CARDIOVASCULAR AND RESPIRATORY EFFECT OF YOGIC SLOW BREATHING IN THE YOGA BEGINNER: WHAT IS THE BEST APPROACH? SLOW BREATHING INCREASES CARDIAC-VAGAL BAROREFLEX SENSITIVITY (BRS), IMPROVES OXYGEN SATURATION, LOWERS BLOOD PRESSURE, AND REDUCES ANXIETY. WITHIN THE YOGA TRADITION SLOW BREATHING IS OFTEN PAIRED WITH A CONTRACTION OF THE GLOTTIS MUSCLES. THIS RESISTANCE BREATH "UJJAYI" IS PERFORMED AT VARIOUS RATES AND RATIOS OF INSPIRATION/EXPIRATION. TO TEST WHETHER UJJAYI HAD ADDITIONAL POSITIVE EFFECTS TO SLOW BREATHING, WE COMPARED BRS AND VENTILATORY CONTROL UNDER DIFFERENT BREATHING PATTERNS (EQUAL/UNEQUAL INSPIRATION/EXPIRATION AT 6 BREATH/MIN, WITH/WITHOUT UJJAYI), IN 17 YOGA-NAIVE YOUNG HEALTHY PARTICIPANTS. BRS INCREASED WITH SLOW BREATHING TECHNIQUES WITH OR WITHOUT EXPIRATORY UJJAYI (P < 0.05 OR HIGHER) EXCEPT WITH INSPIRATORY + EXPIRATORY UJJAYI. THE MAXIMAL INCREASE IN BRS AND DECREASE IN BLOOD PRESSURE WERE FOUND IN SLOW BREATHING WITH EQUAL INSPIRATION AND EXPIRATION. THIS CORRESPONDED WITH A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN OXYGEN SATURATION WITHOUT INCREASE IN HEART RATE AND VENTILATION. UJJAYI SHOWED SIMILAR INCREASE IN OXYGEN SATURATION BUT SLIGHTLY LESSER IMPROVEMENT IN BAROREFLEX SENSITIVITY WITH NO CHANGE IN BLOOD PRESSURE. THE SLOW BREATHING WITH EQUAL INSPIRATION AND EXPIRATION SEEMS THE BEST TECHNIQUE FOR IMPROVING BAROREFLEX SENSITIVITY IN YOGA-NAIVE SUBJECTS. THE EFFECTS OF UJJAYI SEEMS DEPENDENT ON INCREASED INTRATHORACIC PRESSURE THAT REQUIRES GREATER EFFORT THAN NORMAL SLOW BREATHING.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
5  637 26 DO 12-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM INFLUENCE RESPIRATORY FUNCTION OF ELDERLY WOMEN? AGING PRODUCES SEVERAL RESPIRATORY LIMITATIONS AND REDUCES TOLERANCE TO PHYSICAL EFFORTS, SOMETIMES LEADING TO PULMONARY DISEASES IN THE ELDERLY. THE LITERATURE DRAWS ATTENTION TO THE POSSIBLE BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE AMONG THE ELDERLY, PRESENTING EVIDENCE FOR SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN QUALITY OF LIFE. IT WAS HYPOTHESIZED THAT YOGA PRACTICE CAN IMPROVE RESPIRATORY FUNCTION IN THE ELDERLY. THE EFFECTS OF A YOGA PROGRAM ON PULMONARY VOLUMES AND RESPIRATORY MUSCLE STRENGTH WERE VERIFIED IN 36 ELDERLY WOMEN DIVIDED INTO A YOGA GROUP [YG] (63.1 +/- 13.3 YEARS OF AGE) AND A CONTROL GROUP (61.0 +/- 6.9 YEARS OF AGE). MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY AND EXPIRATORY PRESSURE (MIP AND MEP) WERE ASSESSED BY A MANOVACUOMETER AND TIDAL VOLUME (VT), VITAL CAPACITY (VC) AND MINUTE VENTILATION (VE) WERE MEASURED BY A VENTILOMETER. THE PROGRAM COMPRISED 65 MIN SESSIONS, 3 TIMES/WEEK DURING 12 WEEKS. THE HEART RATE AND RESPIRATORY RATE DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE YG (76-39 +/- 8-03 VS. 74-61+/-10.26 BPM AND 18.61 +/- 3.15 VS. 16.72 +/- 3.12 RESP/MIN, RESPECTIVELY). IN THE YG, VT AND VE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (0.55 +/- 0.22 VS. 0.64 +/- 0.2 ML AND 9.19 +/- 2.39 VS. 10.05 +/- 2.11 ML, RESPECTIVELY), AS WELL AS VC (1.48 +/- 0.45 VS. 2.03 +/- 0.72 ML). IMPROVEMENTS WERE ALSO FOUND IN MIP AND MEP IN THE YG (62.17 +/- 14.77 VS. 73.06 +/- 20.16 CMH2O AND 80.56 +/- 23.94 VS. 86.39 +/- 20.16 CMH2O, RESPECTIVELY). IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT A 12-WEEK YOGA PROGRAM SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVES PULMONARY FUNCTION OF AGED WOMEN.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
6 2307 33 TRAINING TO YOGA RESPIRATION SELECTIVELY INCREASES RESPIRATORY SENSATION IN HEALTHY MAN. BECAUSE YOGA PRACTITIONERS THINK THEY ARE BENEFITING FROM THEIR BREATH TRAINING WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT YOGA RESPIRATION TRAINING (YRT) COULD MODIFY THE RESPIRATORY SENSATION. YOGA RESPIRATION (YR) ("UJJAI") CONSISTED OF VERY SLOW, DEEP BREATHS (2-3 MIN(-1)) WITH SUSTAINED BREATH-HOLD AFTER EACH INSPIRATION AND EXPIRATION. AT INCLUSION IN THE STUDY AND AFTER A 2-MONTH YRT PROGRAM, WE DETERMINED IN HEALTHY SUBJECTS THEIR EUPNEIC VENTILATORY PATTERN AND THEIR CAPACITY TO DISCRIMINATE EXTERNAL INSPIRATORY RESISTIVE LOADS (RESPIRATORY SENSATION), DIGITAL TACTILE MECHANICAL PRESSURES (SOMESTHETIC SENSATION) AND SOUND-PRESSURE STIMULATIONS (AUDITORY SENSATION). DATA WERE COMPARED TO A GENDER-, AGE-, AND WEIGHT-MATCHED CONTROL GROUP OF HEALTHY SUBJECTS WHO DID NOT UNDERGO THE YRT PROGRAM BUT WERE EXPLORED AT THE SAME EPOCHS. AFTER THE 2-MONTH YRT PROGRAM, THE RESPIRATORY SENSATION INCREASED. THUS, BOTH THE EXPONENT OF THE STEVEN'S POWER LAW (PSI=KPHIN) AND THE SLOPE OF THE LINEAR-LINEAR PLOT BETWEEN PSI AND MOUTH PRESSURE (PM) WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER, AND THE INTERCEPT WITH ORDINATE AXIS OF THE PSI VERSUS PM RELATIONSHIP WAS LOWER. AFTER YRT, THE PEAK PM DEVELOPED AGAINST INSPIRATORY LOADS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER, REDUCING THE LOAD-INDUCED ACTIVATION OF RESPIRATORY AFFERENTS. YRT INDUCED LONG-LASTING MODIFICATIONS OF THE VENTILATORY PATTERN WITH A SIGNIFICANT LENGTHENING OF EXPIRATORY DURATION AND A MODEST TIDAL VOLUME INCREASE. NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN SOMESTHETIC AND AUDITORY SENSATIONS WERE NOTED. IN THE CONTROL GROUP, THE RESPIRATORY SENSATION WAS NOT MODIFIED DURING A 15-MIN PERIOD OF YOGA RESPIRATION, DESPITE THE PEAK PM CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO ADDED LOADS WERE THEN SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED. THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT TRAINING TO YOGA RESPIRATION SELECTIVELY INCREASES THE RESPIRATORY SENSATION, PERHAPS THROUGH ITS PERSISTENT CONDITIONING OF THE BREATHING PATTERN.	2005	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
7  751 19 EFFECT OF SHORT TERM YOGA PRACTICE ON VENTILATORY FUNCTION TESTS. TWENTYFIVE NORMAL MALE VOLUNTEERS UNDERGOING A TEN WEEKS COURSE IN THE PRACTICE OF YOGA HAVE BEEN STUDIED BY SOME PARAMETERS OF VENTILATORY FUNCTIONS TESTS. THE OBSERVATIONS RECORDED AT THE END OF TEN WEEKS OF THE COURSE HAVE SHOWN IMPROVED VENTILATORY FUNCTIONS IN THE FORM OF LOWERED RESPIRATORY RATE, INCREASED FORCED VITAL CAPACITY, FEV1, MAXIMUM BREATHING CAPACITY AND BREATH HOLDING TIME, WHILE TIDAL VOLUME AND %FEV1, DID NOT REVEAL ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. THUS, A COMBINED PRACTICE OF YOGA SEEMS TO BE BENEFICIAL ON RESPIRATORY EFFICIENCY.	1988	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
8  887 16 EFFECT OF YOGA TYPE BREATHING ON HEART RATE AND CARDIAC AXIS OF NORMAL SUBJECTS. EFFECT OF INSPIRATORY AND EXPIRATORY PHASES OF NORMAL QUIET BREATHING, DEEP BREATHING AND SAVITRI PRANAYAM TYPE BREATHING ON HEART RATE AND MEAN VENTRICULAR QRS AXIS WAS INVESTIGATED IN YOUNG, HEALTHY UNTRAINED SUBJECTS. PRANAYAM TYPE BREATHING PRODUCED SIGNIFICANT CARDIOACCELERATION AND INCREASE IN QRS AXIS DURING THE INSPIRATORY PHASE AS COMPARED TO EUPNEA. ON THE OTHER HAND, EXPIRATORY EFFORT DURING PRANAYAM TYPE BREATHING DID NOT PRODUCE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN HEART RATE OR QRS AXIS. THE CHANGES IN HEART RATE AND QRS AXIS DURING THE INSPIRATORY AND EXPIRATORY PHASES OF PRANAYAM TYPE BREATHING WERE SIMILAR TO THE CHANGES OBSERVED DURING THE CORRESPONDING PHASES OF DEEP BREATHING.	1986	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
9 1112 28 EFFICACY AND TOLERABILITY OF YOGA BREATHING IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE: A PILOT STUDY. PURPOSE: YOGA-DERIVED BREATHING HAS BEEN REPORTED TO IMPROVE GAS EXCHANGE IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC HEART FAILURE AND IN PARTICIPANTS EXPOSED TO HIGH-ALTITUDE HYPOXIA. WE INVESTIGATED THE TOLERABILITY AND EFFECT OF YOGA BREATHING ON VENTILATORY PATTERN AND OXYGENATION IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE (COPD). METHODS: PATIENTS WITH COPD (N = 11, 3 WOMEN) WITHOUT PREVIOUS YOGA PRACTICE AND TAKING ONLY SHORT-ACTING BETA2-ADRENERGIC BLOCKING DRUGS WERE ENROLLED. VENTILATORY PATTERN AND OXYGEN SATURATION WERE MONITORED BY MEANS OF INDUCTIVE PLETHYSMOGRAPHY DURING 30-MINUTE SPONTANEOUS BREATHING AT REST (SB) AND DURING A 30-MINUTE YOGA LESSON (Y). DURING THE YOGA LESSON, THE PATIENTS WERE REQUESTED TO MOBILIZE IN SEQUENCE THE DIAPHRAGM, LOWER CHEST, AND UPPER CHEST ADOPTING A SLOWER AND DEEPER BREATHING. WE EVALUATED OXYGEN SATURATION (SAO2%), TIDAL VOLUME (VT), MINUTE VENTILATION (E), RESPIRATORY RATE (I>F), INSPIRATORY TIME, TOTAL BREATH TIME, FRACTIONAL INSPIRATORY TIME, AN INDEX OF THORACOABDOMINAL COORDINATION, AND AN INDEX OF RAPID SHALLOW BREATHING. CHANGES IN DYSPNEA DURING THE YOGA LESSON WERE ASSESSED WITH THE BORG SCALE. RESULTS: DURING THE YOGA LESSON, DATA SHOWED THE ADOPTION OF A DEEPER AND SLOWER BREATHING PATTERN (VTSB L 0.54[0.04], VTY L 0.74[0.08], P = .01; I>FSB 20.8[1.3], I>FY 13.8[0.2], P = .001) AND A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SAO2% WITH NO CHANGE IN E (SAO2%SB 91.5%[1.13], SAO2%Y 93.5%[0.99], P = .02; ESB L/MIN 11.2[1.1], EY L/MIN 10.2[0.9]). ALL THE PARTICIPANTS REPORTED TO BE COMFORTABLE DURING THE YOGA LESSON, WITH NO INCREASE IN DYSPNEA INDEX. CONCLUSION: WE CONCLUDE THAT SHORT-TERM TRAINING IN YOGA IS WELL TOLERATED AND INDUCES FAVORABLE RESPIRATORY CHANGES IN PATIENTS WITH COPD.	2009	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
10  741 27 EFFECT OF REGULAR YOGA PRACTICE ON RESPIRATORY REGULATION AND EXERCISE PERFORMANCE. YOGA ALTERS SPONTANEOUS RESPIRATORY REGULATION AND REDUCES HYPOXIC AND HYPERCAPNIC VENTILATORY RESPONSES. SINCE A LOWER VENTILATORY RESPONSE IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN IMPROVED ENDURANCE CAPACITY DURING WHOLE-BODY EXERCISE, WE TESTED WHETHER YOGIC SUBJECTS (YOGA) SHOW AN INCREASED ENDURANCE CAPACITY COMPARED TO MATCHED NON-YOGIC INDIVIDUALS (CON) WITH SIMILAR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY LEVELS. RESTING VENTILATION, THE VENTILATORY RESPONSE TO HYPERCAPNIA, PASSIVE LEG MOVEMENT AND EXERCISE, AS WELL AS ENDURANCE PERFORMANCE WERE ASSESSED. YOGA (N = 9), COMPARED TO CONTROL (N = 6), HAD A HIGHER TIDAL VOLUME AT REST (0.7+/-0.2 VS. 0.5+/-0.1 L, P = 0.034) AND A REDUCED VENTILATORY RESPONSE TO HYPERCAPNIA (33+/-15 VS. 47+/-15 L.MIN(-1), P = 0.048). A YOGA SUBGROUP (N = 6) WITH MAXIMAL PERFORMANCE SIMILAR TO CONTROL SHOWED A BLUNTED VENTILATORY RESPONSE TO PASSIVE CYCLING (11+/-2 VS. 14+/-2 L.MIN(-1), P = 0.039) AND A TENDENCY TOWARDS LOWER EXERCISE VENTILATION (33+/-2 VS. 36+/-3 L.MIN(-1), P = 0.094) WHILE CYCLING ENDURANCE (YOGA: 17.3+/-3.3; CON: 19.6+/-8.5 MIN, P = 0.276) DID NOT DIFFER. THUS, YOGA PRACTICE WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVED EXERCISE CAPACITY NOR WITH SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN EXERCISE VENTILATION DESPITE A SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT RESPIRATORY REGULATION AT REST AND IN RESPONSE TO HYPERCAPNIA AND PASSIVE LEG MOVEMENT.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
11  878 23 EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING AND DETRAINING ON RESPIRATORY MUSCLE STRENGTH IN PRE-PUBERTAL CHILDREN: A RANDOMIZED TRIAL. OBJECTIVE: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN I(ST) SECOND (FEV1), PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR), FEVI/FVC RATIO, AND PULMONARY PRESSURES [MAXIMUM INSPIRATORY PRESSURE (MIP), MAXIMUM EXPIRATORY PRESSURE (MEP) AT THE END OF 3 MONTHS YOGA TRAINING AND THE DETRAINING EFFECT ON THE ABOVE PARAMETERS IN 7-9-YEARS-OLD SCHOOL GOING CHILDREN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 100 PARTICIPANTS WERE RECRUITED FROM A SCHOOL IN BANGALORE. AFTER BASELINE ASSESSMENTS, THE PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED TO EITHER YOGA OR PHYSICAL ACTIVITY GROUP. INTERVENTION WAS GIVEN FOR 3 MONTHS, AND MEASURES OF PULMONARY FUNCTION AND PULMONARY PRESSURES WERE DETERMINED IMMEDIATELY POST-INTERVENTION AND AT 3-MONTHS FOLLOW-UP. RESULTS: ALTHOUGH SIGNIFICANT INCREASE WAS OBSERVED IN FVC, FEV1, PEFR, FEV1/FVC, MIP, AND MEP AT POST-INTERVENTION, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO STUDY GROUPS AFTER ADJUSTING FOR HEIGHT AND AGE POST TRAINING . HOWEVER, MIP INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN BOTH THE GROUPS POST-INTERVENTION, BUT THE YOGA GROUP PERFORMED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE PE GROUP. THE EFFECTS OF TRAINING DID NOT FADE OFF EVEN AFTER 3 MONTHS OF DETRAINING. IN FACT, THE FVC AND FEV1 CONTINUED TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY. A TREND OF DECREASE WAS OBSERVED IN PEFR, MIP, AND MEP. HOWEVER, THE VALUES DID NOT REGRESS TO THE BASELINE VALUE. CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT PRACTICE OF YOGA FOR A SHORT DURATION (3 MONTHS) OF TIME CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE RESPIRATORY MUSCLE STRENGTH IN PEDIATRIC POPULATION.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
12  865 26 EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICES ON PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS INCLUDING TRANSFER FACTOR OF LUNG FOR CARBON MONOXIDE (TLCO) IN ASTHMA PATIENTS. PRANA IS THE ENERGY, WHEN THE SELF-ENERGIZING FORCE EMBRACES THE BODY WITH EXTENSION AND EXPANSION AND CONTROL, IT IS PRANAYAMA. IT MAY AFFECT THE MILIEU AT THE BRONCHIOLES AND THE ALVEOLI PARTICULARLY AT THE ALVEOLO-CAPILLARY MEMBRANE TO FACILITATE DIFFUSION AND TRANSPORT OF GASES. IT MAY ALSO INCREASE OXYGENATION AT TISSUE LEVEL. AIM OF OUR STUDY IS TO COMPARE PULMONARY FUNCTIONS AND DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN PATIENTS OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA BEFORE AND AFTER YOGIC INTERVENTION OF 2 MONTHS. SIXTY STABLE ASTHMATIC-PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS I.E GROUP 1 (YOGA TRAINING GROUP) AND GROUP 2 (CONTROL GROUP). EACH GROUP INCLUDED THIRTY PATIENTS. LUNG FUNCTIONS WERE RECORDED ON ALL PATIENTS AT BASELINE, AND THEN AFTER TWO MONTHS. GROUP 1 SUBJECTS SHOWED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT (P<0.001) IN TRANSFER FACTOR OF THE LUNG FOR CARBON MONOXIDE (TLCO), FORCED VITAL CAPACITY (FVC), FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1ST SEC (FEV1), PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PEFR), MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION (MVV) AND SLOW VITAL CAPACITY (SVC) AFTER YOGA PRACTICE. QUALITY OF LIFE ALSO INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT PRANAYAMA & YOGA BREATHING AND STRETCHING POSTURES ARE USED TO INCREASE RESPIRATORY STAMINA, RELAX THE CHEST MUSCLES, EXPAND THE LUNGS, RAISE ENERGY LEVELS, AND CALM THE BODY.	2012

RESPIRATORY MUSCLE TRAINING HAS BEEN WIDELY STUDIED AND RECOMMENDED AS A TREATMENT OPTION FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN WHOLE-BODY EXERCISE TRAINING (WBET); HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS OF INSPIRATORY MUSCLE TRAINING AND YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES ON RM FUNCTION REMAIN UNKNOWN, SPECIFICALLY IN IMPAIRED OLDER ADULTS. PURPOSE: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF INSPIRATORY THRESHOLD TRAINING (ITT) AND YOGA RESPIRATORY TRAINING (YRT) ON RM FUNCTION IN INSTITUTIONALIZED FRAIL OLDER ADULTS. METHODS: EIGHTY-ONE RESIDENTS (90% WOMEN; MEAN AGE, 85 YEARS), WHO WERE UNABLE TO PERFORM WBET (INABILITY TO INDEPENDENTLY WALK MORE THAN 10 M), WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A CONTROL GROUP OR ONE OF THE 2 EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS (ITT OR YRT). EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS PERFORMED A SUPERVISED INTERVAL-BASED TRAINING PROTOCOL, EITHER THROUGH THRESHOLD INSPIRATORY MUSCLE TRAINING DEVICE OR YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES, WHICH LASTED 6 WEEKS (5 DAYS PER WEEK). OUTCOME MEASURES WERE COLLECTED AT 4 TIME POINTS (PRETRAINING, INTERMEDIATE, POSTTRAINING, AND FOLLOW-UP) AND INCLUDED THE MAXIMUM RESPIRATORY PRESSURES (MAXIMUM INSPIRATORY PRESSURE [MIP] AND MAXIMUM EXPIRATORY PRESSURE [MEP]) AND THE MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION (MVV). RESULTS: SEVENTY-ONE RESIDENTS COMPLETED THE STUDY: CONTROL (N = 24); ITT (N = 23); YRT (N = 24). THE TREATMENT ON HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON MIP YRT (F(6,204) = 6.755, P < .001, ETA2 = 0.166), MEP (F(6,204) = 4.257, P < .001, ETA2 = 0.111), AND MVV (F(6,204) = 5.322, P < .001, ETA2 = 0.135). ANALYSES SHOWED THAT THE YRT GROUP HAD A GREATER INCREASE OF RM STRENGTH (MIP AND MEP) AND ENDURANCE (MVV) THAN CONTROL AND/OR ITT GROUPS. CONCLUSION: YOGA RESPIRATORY TRAINING APPEARS TO BE AN EFFECTIVE AND WELL-TOLERATED EXERCISE REGIMEN IN FRAIL OLDER ADULTS AND MAY THEREFORE BE A USEFUL ALTERNATIVE TO ITT OR NO TRAINING, TO IMPROVE RM FUNCTION IN OLDER POPULATION, WHEN WBET IS NOT POSSIBLE.	2014	

14 2363 25 VOLUNTARILY INDUCED VOMITING - A YOGA TECHNIQUE TO ENHANCE PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN HEALTHY HUMANS. VOMITING IS A COMPLEX AUTONOMIC REFLEX ORCHESTRATED BY SEVERAL NEUROLOGICAL CENTRES IN THE BRAIN. VAGUS, THE CRANIAL NERVE PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN REGULATION OF VOMITING. KUNJAL KRIYA (VOLUNTARILY INDUCED VOMITING), IS A YOGIC CLEANSING TECHNIQUE WHICH INVOLVES VOLUNTARILY INDUCING VOMITING AFTER DRINKING SALINE WATER (5%) ON EMPTY STOMACH. THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED WITH AN OBJECTIVE TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECT OF VOLUNTARY INDUCED VOMITING (VIV) ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS IN EXPERIENCED PRACTITIONERS AND NOVICES AND DERIVE ITS POSSIBLE THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS. EIGHTEEN HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS VOLUNTEERED FOR THE STUDY OF WHICH NINE HAD PRIOR EXPERIENCE OF VIV WHILE NINE DID NOT. PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS WERE PERFORMED BEFORE AND AFTER 10 MIN OF REST FOLLOWING VIV. ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE WAS PERFORMED ADJUSTED FOR GENDER AND BASELINE VALUES. NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WERE OBSERVED ACROSS GENDERS. THE RESULTS OF THE PRESENT STUDY SUGGEST A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SLOW VITAL CAPACITY [F(1,13) = 5.699; P = 0.03] AND FORCED INSPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1ST SECOND [P = 0.02] AND REDUCTION IN EXPIRATORY RESERVE VOLUME [F(1,13) = 5.029; P = 0.04] AND RESPIRATORY RATE [F(1,13) = 3.244, P = 0.09]. THESE CHANGES SUGGEST THE POSSIBLE ROLE OF VIV IN ENHANCING THE ENDURANCE OF THE RESPIRATORY MUSCLES, DECREASED AIRWAY RESISTANCE, BETTER EMPTYING OF LUNGS AND VAGAL PREDOMINANCE RESPECTIVELY. WE CONCLUDE THAT VIV WHEN PRACTICED REGULARLY ENHANCES THE ENDURANCE OF THE RESPIRATORY MUSCLES AND DECREASES AIRWAY RESISTANCE. THESE FINDINGS ALSO INDICATE NEED FOR SCIENTIFIC UNDERSTANDING OF VIV IN THE MANAGEMENT OF MOTION SICKNESS AND RESTRICTIVE PULMONARY DISORDERS LIKE BRONCHITIS AND BRONCHIAL ASTHMA.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
15 2823 22 YOGA VERSUS AEROBIC ACTIVITY: EFFECTS ON SPIROMETRY RESULTS AND MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE. OBJECTIVE: TO CLARIFY WHETHER, IN HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS, PRACTICING YOGA CAN MODIFY MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE AND SPIROMETRIC INDICES WHEN COMPARED WITH THE PRACTICE OF AEROBIC EXERCISE. MEYHODS: A CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL. A TOTAL OF 31 HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS WERE ALLOCATED TO PRACTICE AEROBIC EXERCISE (N = 15) OR TO PRACTICE YOGA (N = 16). THOSE IN THE FIRST GROUP SERVED AS CONTROLS AND ENGAGED IN AEROBIC EXERCISE FOR 45-60 MINUTES, TWICE A WEEK FOR THREE MONTHS. THOSE IN THE SECOND GROUP PRACTICED SELECTED YOGIC TECHNIQUES, ALSO IN SESSIONS OF 45-60 MINUTES, TWICE A WEEK FOR THREE MONTHS. FORCED VITAL CAPACITY, FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN ONE SECOND AND MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE WERE MEASURED BEFORE AND AFTER THE THREE MONTHS OF TRAINING. RESULTS: NO SIGNIFICANT ALTERATIONS WERE SEEN IN THE SPIROMETRIC INDICES. A SLIGHT, ALTHOUGH NOT SIGNIFICANT, IMPROVEMENT IN MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE WAS SEEN IN BOTH GROUPS. HOWEVER, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE, SEEN IN BOTH GENDERS, BETWEEN THE ABSOLUTE DELTA (FINAL VALUE MINUS BASELINE VALUE) OF MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE FOR THE GROUP PRACTICING YOGA AND THAT OBTAINED FOR THE GROUP ENGAGING IN AEROBIC EXERCISE (MALES: 19.5 CM H2O VERSUS 2.8 CM H2O, P = 0.05; FEMALES: 20 CM H2O VERSUS 3.9 CM H2O, P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: NEITHER YOGA NOR AEROBIC EXERCISE PROVIDED A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE AFTER THREE MONTHS. HOWEVER, THE ABSOLUTE VARIATION IN MAXIMAL INSPIRATORY PRESSURE WAS GREATER AMONG THOSE PRACTICING YOGA.	2006	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
16 1123 19 EFFICACY OF NATUROPATHY AND YOGA IN BRONCHIAL ASTHMA. THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF A ONE MONTH IN-PATIENT NATUROPATHY AND YOGA PROGRAMME FOR PATIENTS WITH ASTHMA. RETROSPECTIVE DATA OF 159 BRONCHIAL ASTHMA PATIENTS, UNDERGOING THE NATUROPATHY AND YOGA PROGRAMME, WAS ANALYZED FOR FORCED VITAL CAPACITY, FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME AT THE END OF 1 SECOND, MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE ON ADMISSION, 11TH DAY, ON DISCHARGE AND ONCE IN THREE MONTHS FOR THREE YEARS. THE PAIRED SAMPLE T TEST RESULTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE FORCED VITAL CAPACITY AND FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME FROM THE DATE OF ADMISSION UP TO 6TH MONTH (P < 0.0035) POST BONFERRONI CORRECTION. MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FROM ADMISSION TILL THE DATE OF DISCHARGE (P < 0.0035) AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FROM ADMISSION TILL THE 36TH MONTH OF FOLLOW-UP (P < 0.0035), POST BONFERRONI CORRECTION. THIS VALIDATED THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF COMBINING NATUROPATHY AND YOGA FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
17 2005 20 STUDY OF PULMONARY AND AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS OF ASTHMA PATIENTS AFTER YOGA TRAINING. "THE CONCEPT OF YOGA IS HELPFUL FOR THE TREATMENT OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA", HAS CREATED A GREAT INTEREST IN THE MEDICAL RESEARCH FIELD. IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER AUTONOMIC FUNCTIONS AND PULMONARY FUNCTIONS ARE IMPROVED IN ASTHMA PATIENTS AFTER SHORT TERM YOGA TRAINING, A STUDY WAS CONDUCTED WITH NINE DIAGNOSED BRONCHIAL ASTHMA PATIENTS. YOGA TRAINING WAS GIVEN FOR SEVEN DAYS IN A CAMP IN ADHYATMA SADHNA KENDRA, NEW DELHI. THE AUTONOMIC FUNCTION TESTS TO MEASURE THE PARASYMPATHETIC REACTIVITY (DEEP BREATHING TEST, VALSALVA MANOUEVER), SYMPATHETIC REACTIVITY (HAND GRIP TEST, COLD PRESSURE TEST), AND PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS FVC, FEV1, PEFR, PIF, BHT AND CE WERE RECORDED BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA TRAINING. THE RESTING HEART RATE AFTER YOGA TRAINING (P < 0.05) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED (89.55 +/- 18.46/MIN TO 76.22 +/- 16.44/MIN). THE SYMPATHETIC REACTIVITY WAS REDUCED FOLLOWING YOGA TRAINING AS INDICATED BY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.01) REDUCTION IN DBP AFTER HGT. THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN PARASYMPATHETIC REACTIVITY. THE FVC, FEV1, PEFR DID NOT SHOW ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. THE PIF (P < 0.01), BHT (P < 0.01) AND CE (P < 0.01) SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT. THE RESULTS CLOSELY INDICATED THE REDUCTION IN SYMPATHETIC REACTIVITY AND IMPROVEMENT IN THE PULMONARY VENTILATION BY WAY OF RELAXATION OF VOLUNTARY INSPIRATORY AND EXPIRATORY MUSCLES. THE "COMPREHENSIVE YOGIC LIFE STYLE CHANGE PROGRAMME FOR PATIENTS OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA" HAVE SHOWN SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT EVEN WITHIN A SHORT PERIOD.	1996	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
18  885 20 EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON REACTION TIME, RESPIRATORY ENDURANCE AND MUSCLE STRENGTH. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THE PRACTICE OF YOGA IMPROVES PHYSICAL AND MENTAL PERFORMANCE. THE PRESENT INVESTIGATION WAS UNDERTAKEN TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF YOGA TRAINING ON VISUAL AND AUDITORY REACTION TIMES (RTS), MAXIMUM EXPIRATORY PRESSURE (MEP), MAXIMUM INSPIRATORY PRESSURE (MIP), 40 MMHG TEST, BREATH HOLDING TIME AFTER EXPIRATION (BHTEXP), BREATH HOLDING TIME AFTER INSPIRATION (BHTINSP), AND HAND GRIP STRENGTH (HGS). TWENTY SEVEN STUDENT VOLUNTEERS WERE GIVEN YOGA TRAINING FOR 12 WEEKS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.001) DECREASE IN VISUAL RT (FROM 270.0 +/- 6.20 (SE) TO 224.81 +/- 5.76 MS) AS WELL AS AUDITORY RT (FROM 194.18 +/- 6.00 TO 157.33 +/- 4.85 MS). MEP INCREASED FROM 92.61 +/- 9.04 TO 126.46 +/- 10.75 MMHG, WHILE MIP INCREASED FROM 72.23 +/- 6.45 TO 90.92 +/- 6.03 MMHG, BOTH THESE CHANGES BEING STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.05). 40 MMHG TEST AND HGS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY (P < 0.001) FROM 36.57 +/- 2.04 TO 53.36 +/- 3.95 S AND 13.78 +/- 0.58 TO 16.67 +/- 0.49 KG RESPECTIVELY. BHTEXP INCREASED FROM 32.15 +/- 1.41 TO 44.53 +/- 3.78S (P < 0.01) AND BHTINSP INCREASED FROM 63.69 +/- 5.38 TO 89.07 +/- 9.61 S (P < 0.05). OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT YOGA PRACTICE FOR 12 WEEKS RESULTS IN SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN VISUAL AND AUDITORY RTS AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN RESPIRATORY PRESSURES, BREATH HOLDING TIMES AND HGS.	1992	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
19  844 21 EFFECT OF YOGA ON PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS OF HYPOTHYROID PATIENTS. AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO SEE ANY EFFECT ON RESPIRATORY FUNCTIONS IN HYPOTHYROID PATIENTS AFTER PRANAYAMA (YOGA). THE SUBJECTS FOR THE STUDY WERE 20 HYPOTHYROID FEMALES, 39.70 +/- 8.27 YEARS OF MEAN AGE REFERRED FROM MEDICINE DEPARTMENT OF UCMS & G.T.B. HOSPITAL. SPIRO METRIC RECORDINGS WERE TAKEN WITH HYPAIR (VERSION-1.28). BASELINE (FIRST) RECORDINGS WERE TAKEN WHEN PATIENT CAME FOR THE FIRST TIME. PATIENTS CAME TO YOGA LAB IN PHYSIOLOGY DEPARTMENT FOR 21 DAYS CONTINUOUSLY WHERE THEY WERE TRAINED BY THE YOGA INSTRUCTORS AND THEN TOLD TO DO PRANAYAMA AT HOME AND CALLED AT REGULAR INTERVALS AFTER 7 DAYS TO SEE THE COMPLIANCE. THE BREATHING EXERCISES WERE DONE FOR 45 MINUTES EVERYDAY. AFTER 6 MONTHS OF PRANAYAMA SECOND RECORDING WAS TAKEN AND COMPARED WITH THE BASELINE. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN FIRST SECOND (FEV1), MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION (MVV) AND INSPIRATORY CAPACITY(IC). THUS PRANAYAMA AND MEDITATION HAS BENEFICIAL EFFECT ON PULMONARY FUNCTIONS OF HYPOTHYROID PATIENTS ALONG WITH CONVENTIONAL TREATMENT.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
20  787 23 EFFECT OF YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES (PRANAYAMA) ON AIRWAY REACTIVITY IN SUBJECTS WITH ASTHMA. THE EFFECTS OF TWO PRANAYAMA YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES ON AIRWAY REACTIVITY, AIRWAY CALIBRE, SYMPTOM SCORES, AND MEDICATION USE IN PATIENTS WITH MILD ASTHMA WERE ASSESSED IN A RANDOMISED, DOUBLE-BLIND, PLACEBO-CONTROLLED, CROSSOVER TRIAL. AFTER BASELINE ASSESSMENT OVER 1 WEEK, 18 PATIENTS WITH MILD ASTHMA PRACTISED SLOW DEEP BREATHING FOR 15 MIN TWICE A DAY FOR TWO CONSECUTIVE 2-WEEK PERIODS. DURING THE ACTIVE PERIOD, SUBJECTS WERE ASKED TO BREATHE THROUGH A PINK CITY LUNG (PCL) EXERCISER--A DEVICE WHICH IMPOSES SLOWING OF BREATHING AND A 1:2 INSPIRATION:EXPIRATION DURATION RATIO EQUIVALENT TO PRANAYAMA BREATHING METHODS; DURING THE CONTROL PERIOD, SUBJECTS BREATHED THROUGH A MATCHED PLACEBO DEVICE. MEAN FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1 S (FEV1), PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE, SYMPTOM SCORE, AND INHALER USE OVER THE LAST 3 DAYS OF EACH TREATMENT PERIOD WERE ASSESSED IN COMPARISON WITH THE BASELINE ASSESSMENT PERIOD; ALL IMPROVED MORE WITH THE PCL EXERCISER THAN WITH THE PLACEBO DEVICE, BUT THE DIFFERENCES WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT. THERE WAS A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE DOSE OF HISTAMINE NEEDED TO PROVOKE A 20% REDUCTION IN FEV1 (PD20) DURING PRANAYAMA BREATHING BUT NOT WITH THE PLACEBO DEVICE. THE USEFULNESS OF CONTROLLED VENTILATION EXERCISES IN THE CONTROL OF ASTHMA SHOULD BE FURTHER INVESTIGATED.	1990

1 1128 175 EFFICACY OF VAMANA KARMA WITH IKSHVAKU KSHEERA YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF TAMAKA SHVASA (BRONCHIAL ASTHMA). INTRODUCTION: BRONCHIAL ASTHMA IS A HIGHLY PREVALENT DISEASE, AND IN MOST OF THE ETIOPATHOGENESIS AND SYMPTOMATOLOGY, IT CAN BE CORRELATED WITH TAMAKA SHVASA. IKSHVAKU (LAGENARIA VULGARIS [MANILA] STANDLEY.) IS AN ANNUAL HERBACEOUS CLIMBING PLANT WITH A LONG HISTORY OF MEDICINAL USES FOR THE TREATMENT OF VARIOUS AILMENTS INCLUDING JAUNDICE, DIABETES, ULCER, PILES, COLITIS, ASTHMA, INSANITY, HYPERTENSION, CONGESTIVE CARDIAC FAILURE AND SKIN DISORDERS. ITS FRUIT PULP IS USED BOTH AS AN EMETIC AND AS A PURGATIVE. AIMS: TO STUDY THE EFFICACY OF VAMANA KARMA WITH IKSHVAKU (LAGENARIA VULGARIS [MANILA] STANDLEY) KSHEERA YOGA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 15 PATIENTS FULFILLING THE DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR BRONCHIAL ASTHMA WERE SELECTED FROM OUTPATIENT AND INPATIENT DEPARTMENT OF PANCHAKARMA DEPARTMENT. THE SIGN AND SYMPTOMS, MAINLY BREATHLESSNESS, COUGH AND RHONCHI WERE GIVEN SCORES DEPENDING ON THEIR SEVERITY. THE PATIENTS WERE ALSO ASSESSED FOR LUNG FUNCTION TEST TO DETERMINE PULMONARY IMPAIRMENT. FOR VAMANA, THEY WERE GIVEN DEEPANA AND PACHANA WITH TRIKATU CHURNA FOR 3 DAYS AND THEN THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO SNEHAPANA WITH LUKEWARM COW'S GHEE. AFTER THE COMPLETION OF SNEHAPANA, THE PATIENT WERE GIVEN ABHYANGA, VASHPA SWEDANA AND DIET WITH PREDOMINANCE OF KAPHA (KAPHA BAHULA AHARA- DIET MIXED WITH MILK OR CURD), WHICH WAS THEN FOLLOWED BY VAMANA WITH IKSHVAKU KSHEERA YOGA AND SAMSARJANA KRAMA. FOLLOW-UP WAS DONE AT AN INTERVAL OF 15 DAYS FOR THREE TIMES AND T SCORES WERE NOTED BEFORE AND AFTER THE TREATMENT. THE SCORES WERE ANALYZED USING WILCOXON SIGNED-RANK TEST FOR SUBJECTIVE PARAMETERS AND STUDENT'S PAIRED T-TEST FOR OBJECTIVE PARAMETERS. RESULTS: THE TRIAL DRUG HAS SHOWN STATISTICALLY HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN BREATHLESSNESS, COUGH, RHONCHI, AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN LUNG FUNCTION TESTS. CONCLUSION: THE TEST DRUG PROVED ITS EMETIC EFFECT ON THE PATIENTS OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA AND THUS RELIEVED THE SYMPTOMS OF THE DISEASE IMMEDIATELY. IT HAS REDUCED FREQUENCY OF EPISODES OF BREATHLESSNESS AND SEVERITY OF SYMPTOMS.	2017

3  483  54 CLINICAL EFFICACY OF VAMANA KARMA WITH IKSHWAAKU BEEJA YOGA FOLLOWED BY SHATAPUSHPADI GHANAVATI IN THE MANAGEMENT OF ARTAVA KSHAYA W. S. R TO POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME. BACKGROUND: DUE TO SEDENTARY LIFESTYLE AND STRESS, THE INCIDENCE OF METABOLIC DISORDERS ARE INCREASING DAY BY DAY. AMONG THESE POLYCYSTIC OVARIAN SYNDROME (PCOS) IS AN INTRICATE DISORDER AFFECTING 4%-8% WOMEN IN THEIR REPRODUCTIVE AGE AND RELATED TO OVARIAN DYSFUNCTION CHARACTERIZED BY OBESITY, OLIGOMENORRHEA, ANOVULATION AND HYPERANDROGENISM. IN MODERN SYSTEM OF MEDICINE, THE AVAILABLE ALLOPATHIC REGIMEN HAS ITS OWN LIMITATIONS, SO IT IS NEED OF TIME TO FIND A SAFE AND EFFECTIVE ALTERNATIVE THERAPY FOR SUCH TYPE OF CONDITION. THE MOST COMMON SYMPTOM IN 85%-90% OF PCOS PATIENTS IS OLIGOMENORRHEA WHICH CAN BE CORRELATED TO ARTAVA KSHAYA (LOSS OF MENSTRUAL FLUID) IN AYURVEDA. HENCE, IN THE PRESENT CLINICAL STUDY, VAMANA KARMA (THERAPEUTIC VOMITING) WITH IKSHWAAKU SEED FORMULATION FOLLOWED BY SHATAPUSHPADI GHANAVATI WAS PLANNED. AIMS: TO EVALUATE THE EFFICACY OF VAMANA KARMA (THERAPEUTIC VOMITING) FOLLOWED BY SHATAPUSHPADI GHANAVATI IN THE MANAGEMENT OF AARTAVA KSHAYA (LOSS OF MENSTRUAL FLUID) W. S. R TO PCOS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 15 PATIENTS OF PCOS WERE CLINICALLY DIAGNOSED AND TREATED BY VAMANA KARMA (THERAPEUTIC VOMITING) PROCEDURE WITH IKSHWAAKU SEED FORMULATION. AFTER COMPLETION OF VAMANA KARMA (THERAPEUTIC VOMITING) AND SAMSARJANA KRAMA, (POST THERAPY DIETARY REGIMEN FOR REVIVAL) SHATAPUSHPADI GHANAVATI 2 VATI (EACH 500 MG) TWICE IN A DAY WITH LUKEWARM WATER WAS GIVEN FOR 45 DAYS. AFTER COMPLETION OF 2-MONTH TRIAL, ASSESSMENT OF THERAPY WAS ESTIMATED BY SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE PARAMETERS. RESULTS: STATISTICALLY EXTREMELY SIGNIFICANT (P < 0.0001) RESULTS WERE FOUND IN MENSTRUAL IRREGULARITIES, OBESITY, AND BODY MASS INDEX. THE SIGNIFICANT RESULT IN REDUCTION OF NONDOMINANT FOLLICLES (P = 0.01 AND 0.03 FOR RIGHT AND LEFT OVARY, RESPECTIVELY), LOWERING THE FASTING BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL (P = 0.02) AND HIRSUTISM (P = 0.03) WAS FOUND. CONCLUSION: VAMANA KARMA (THERAPEUTIC VOMITING) FOLLOWED BY SHATAPUSHPADI GHANAVATI IS VERY EFFECTIVE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF OBESE PCOS PATIENTS AND INCREASING CHANCES OF CONCEPTION.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
4 2283  47 THE USE OF INTEGRATIVE THERAPY BASED ON YOGA AND AYURVEDA IN THE TREATMENT OF A HIGH-RISK CASE OF COVID-19/SARS-COV-2 WITH MULTIPLE COMORBIDITIES: A CASE REPORT. BACKGROUND: WE REPORT A HIGH-RISK CASE OF A CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 19 (COVID-19)-POSITIVE PATIENT WITH COMORBIDITIES INCLUDING DIABETES MELLITUS (DM), HYPERTENSION (HTN), HYPOTHYROIDISM AND CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE (CKD), TREATED SUCCESSFULLY USING AN INTEGRATIVE THERAPY PLAN BASED ON AYURVEDA AND YOGA, ALONG WITH GOVERNMENT-MANDATED COMPULSORY MODERN WESTERN MEDICINE (MWM) TREATMENT. RECENTLY, SOME EVIDENCE HAS BEEN EMERGING ON THE USE OF AYURVEDA FOR TREATMENT OF COVID-19. THE CLASSICAL TEXTS OF AYURVEDIC MEDICINE SUCH AS CHARAKA SAMHITA AND SUSHRUTA SAMHITA CONTAIN DESCRIPTIONS OF PANDEMICS OF SIMILAR PROPORTIONS AND DESCRIBE THEM AS JANAPADODDHVANSA, MEANING THE DESTRUCTION OF COMMUNITIES, ALONG WITH THEIR CAUSES AND TREATMENT. CASE PRESENTATION: THE CASE REPORTED HEREIN IS A 55-YEAR-OLD MAN FROM DELHI, INDIA, WITH CONFIRMED (TESTED) COVID-19, WHO FIRST TOOK MWM FOR 7 DAYS BEFORE SEEKING INTEGRATIVE THERAPY. THE PATIENT HAS COMORBIDITIES INCLUDING DM, HTN, HYPOTHYROIDISM AND CKD AND HAD DEVELOPED SYMPTOMS INCLUDING FEVER (WHICH WAS RESOLVED BY THE TIME INTEGRATIVE THERAPY WAS STARTED), SORE THROAT, DRY COUGH, BODY ACHES, WEAKNESS, BAD TASTE AND SMELL, AND HEAVINESS IN THE ABDOMEN. BASED ON THE PATIENT'S SYMPTOMS AND COMORBIDITIES, A TREATMENT PLAN INCLUDING AYURVEDIC MEDICINES, YOGA PROTOCOL, DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS AND LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS WAS PRESCRIBED BY A REGISTERED AYURVEDA DOCTOR AND A YOGA CONSULTANT. THE PATIENT STARTED EXPERIENCING IMPROVEMENT IN ALL THE SYMPTOMS WITHIN 2 DAYS AFTER STARTING THE TREATMENT; HE REPORTED APPROXIMATELY [FORMULA: SEE TEXT] RELIEF FROM THE SYMPTOMS AFTER 5 DAYS, AND ALMOST COMPLETE RELIEF WITHIN 9 DAYS. ALSO, THE BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS (BOTH FASTING BLOOD SUGAR [FBS] AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD SUGAR [PPBS]) EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT AFTER 5 DAYS, AND DECREASED TO WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE WITHIN 12 DAYS. BESIDES RELIEF IN SYMPTOMS, THE PATIENT'S REAL-TIME REVERSE TRANSCRIPTION POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION (RT-PCR) TEST DONE ON THE 19TH DAY RETURNED NEGATIVE RESULTS. CONCLUSIONS: INTEGRATIVE THERAPY WAS FOUND TO BE EFFECTIVE IN MITIGATING THE SYMPTOMS OF COVID-19 IN THIS PATIENT WITH MULTIPLE COMORBIDITIES. MOREOVER, A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS (NOT UNDER CONTROL WITH MODERN MEDICINE) WAS ALSO ACHIEVED. INTEGRATIVE THERAPY BASED ON THE CLASSICAL TEXTS OF AYURVEDA AND YOGA MAY OFFER A PROMISING AND SCALABLE TREATMENT OPTION FOR COVID-19 PATIENTS. A CASE SERIES OR A SUITABLY DESIGNED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IS NEEDED TO ASSESS ITS EFFICACY.	2021	

5 2885  51 YOGA: AS AN ADJUNCT THERAPY TO TRIM DOWN THE AYURVEDIC DRUG REQUIREMENT IN NON INSULIN-DEPENDENT DIABETES MELLITUS. INTRODUCTION: IN SPITE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF DRUGS SHOWING ANTI-HYPERGLYCEMIC ACTIVITIES, NONE OF THEM HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN COMPLETE MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES MELLITUS (DM). YOGA AND AYURVEDA ARE THE TWO SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT IN INDIA, WHICH HAVE A HISTORY OF CURING DISEASES SINCE THOUSANDS OF YEARS. YOGIC TECHNIQUES AND AYURVEDIC HERBS HAVE PROVEN THEIR ANTI-DIABETIC POTENTIAL WITHOUT INDUCING UNTOWARD EFFECTS. THE PRESENT STUDY COMBINES AYURVEDIC MEDICATION WITH YOGA TECHNIQUES AS A NEW APPROACH TOWARD HEALING DM. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF YOGA THERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF NON INSULIN-DEPENDENT DM (NIDDM) AND TO DECREASE THE ORAL DRUG DOSE REQUIREMENT OF GUDUCI GHANA TABLET. MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIRTY KNOWN NIDDM PATIENTS OF BOTH GENDERS, WHO WERE ON GUDUCI GHANA (SOLIDIFIED AQUEOUS EXTRACT OF TINOSPORA CORDIFOLIA (WILLD.) MIERS.) TABLETS FROM PAST 2 MONTHS AS AYURVEDIC REMEDY FOR DM WERE SELECTED. ALONG WITH GUDUCI GHANA ADMINISTRATION, THE SUBJECTS WERE INSTRUCTED TO FOLLOW YOGIC PROCEDURES INCLUDING ASANAS, PRANAYAMA, AND SUDDHI KRIYAS. THE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED FOR 8 WEEKS, WHEREIN FASTING BLOOD SUGAR (FBS) AND POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD SUGAR (PPBS) LEVELS ALONG WITH RELIEF IN SIGN AND SYMPTOMS WERE ASSESSED AT EVERY 2 WEEKS INTERVALS, AND ACCORDING TO RELIEF IN SIGN AND SYMPTOMS, TAPERING OF DRUG DOSAGE WAS CARRIED OUT. THE OBTAINED DATA WERE ANALYZED STATISTICALLY BY APPLYING PAIRED T-TEST. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: THE RESULTS OBTAINED WERE PROMISING AS THE RELIEF IN DIABETIC SYMPTOMATOLOGY WAS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT IN TERMS OF P VALUE. 80.83% REDUCTION IN DOSE OF GUDUCI GHANA TABLETS AND 7.85% AND 8.78% FALL IN FBS AND PPBS LEVELS, RESPECTIVELY, AFTER THE COMPLETE COURSE OF TREATMENT. THE OBTAINED P VALUE SHOWED HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT RESULTS.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
6  867  60 EFFECT OF YOGA REGIMEN ON LUNG FUNCTIONS INCLUDING DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE PATIENTS: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED STUDY. BACKGROUND: LUNG FUNCTIONS ARE FOUND TO BE IMPAIRED IN CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE (CAD), CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE, LEFT VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION, AND AFTER CARDIAC SURGERY. DIFFUSION CAPACITY PROGRESSIVELY WORSENS AS THE SEVERITY OF CAD INCREASES DUE TO REDUCTION IN LUNG TISSUE PARTICIPATING IN GAS EXCHANGE. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISES AND YOGIC POSTURES MAY PLAY AN IMPRESSIVE ROLE IN IMPROVING CARDIO-RESPIRATORY EFFICIENCY AND FACILITATING GAS DIFFUSION AT THE ALVEOLO-CAPILLARY MEMBRANE. THIS STUDY WAS DONE TO SEE THE EFFECT OF YOGA REGIMEN ON LUNG FUNCTIONS PARTICULARLY DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN CAD PATIENTS. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A TOTAL OF 80 STABLE CAD PATIENTS BELOW 65 YEARS OF AGE OF BOTH SEXES WERE SELECTED AND RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS OF 40 EACH. GROUP I CAD PATIENTS WERE GIVEN YOGA REGIMEN FOR 3 MONTHS WHICH CONSISTED OF YOGIC POSTURES, PRANAYAMA BREATHING EXERCISES, DIETARY MODIFICATION, AND HOLISTIC TEACHING ALONG WITH THEIR CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE WHILE GROUP II CAD PATIENTS WERE PUT ONLY ON CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE. LUNG FUNCTIONS INCLUDING DIFFUSION CAPACITY WERE RECORDED THRICE IN BOTH THE GROUPS: 0 DAY AS BASELINE, 22(ND) DAY AND ON 90(TH) DAY BY USING COMPUTERIZED MS MEDISOFT CARDIO-RESPIRATORY INSTRUMENT, HYP'AIR COMPACT MODEL OF CARDIO-RESPIRATORY TESTING MACHINE WAS MANUFACTURED BY P K MORGAN, INDIA. THE RECORDED PARAMETERS WERE STATISTICALLY ANALYZED BY REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA FOLLOWED BY TUKEY'S TEST IN BOTH THE GROUPS. CARDIOVASCULAR PARAMETERS WERE ALSO COMPARED BEFORE AND AFTER INTERVENTION IN BOTH THE GROUPS. RESULTS: STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE SEEN IN SLOW VITAL CAPACITY, FORCED VITAL CAPACITY, PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE, MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION, AND DIFFUSION FACTOR/ TRANSFER FACTOR OF LUNG FOR CARBON MONOXIDE AFTER 3 MONTHS OF YOGA REGIMEN IN GROUP I. FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME IN 1(ST) SEC (FEV1), AND FEV1 % ALSO SHOWED A TREND TOWARD IMPROVEMENT ALTHOUGH NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. HR, SBP AND DBP ALSO SHOWED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN GROUP-I PATIENTS WHO FOLLOWED YOGA REGIMEN. CONCLUSIONS: YOGA REGIMEN WAS FOUND TO IMPROVE LUNG FUNCTIONS AND DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN CAD PATIENTS BESIDES IMPROVING CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTIONS. THUS, IT CAN BE USED AS A COMPLIMENTARY OR ADJUNCT THERAPY ALONG WITH THE CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE FOR THEIR TREATMENT AND REHABILITATION.	2015	
                                                                                                                                                                                                          
7  865  33 EFFECT OF YOGA PRACTICES ON PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS INCLUDING TRANSFER FACTOR OF LUNG FOR CARBON MONOXIDE (TLCO) IN ASTHMA PATIENTS. PRANA IS THE ENERGY, WHEN THE SELF-ENERGIZING FORCE EMBRACES THE BODY WITH EXTENSION AND EXPANSION AND CONTROL, IT IS PRANAYAMA. IT MAY AFFECT THE MILIEU AT THE BRONCHIOLES AND THE ALVEOLI PARTICULARLY AT THE ALVEOLO-CAPILLARY MEMBRANE TO FACILITATE DIFFUSION AND TRANSPORT OF GASES. IT MAY ALSO INCREASE OXYGENATION AT TISSUE LEVEL. AIM OF OUR STUDY IS TO COMPARE PULMONARY FUNCTIONS AND DIFFUSION CAPACITY IN PATIENTS OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA BEFORE AND AFTER YOGIC INTERVENTION OF 2 MONTHS. SIXTY STABLE ASTHMATIC-PATIENTS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS I.E GROUP 1 (YOGA TRAINING GROUP) AND GROUP 2 (CONTROL GROUP). EACH GROUP INCLUDED THIRTY PATIENTS. LUNG FUNCTIONS WERE RECORDED ON ALL PATIENTS AT BASELINE, AND THEN AFTER TWO MONTHS.

8  689  41 EFFECT OF AYURVEDA INTERVENTION, LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AND YOGA IN PREDIABETIC AND TYPE 2 DIABETES UNDER THE NATIONAL PROGRAMME FOR PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF CANCER, DIABETES, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES AND STROKE (NPCDCS)-AYUSH INTEGRATION PROJECT. BACKGROUND: TYPE 2 DIABETES IS A LIFESTYLE-RELATED DISORDER THAT AFFECTS AROUND 422 MILLION INDIVIDUALS IN INDIA. INTEGRATION OF AYUSH (AYURVEDA) WITH THE NATIONAL PROGRAMME FOR PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF CANCER, DIABETES, CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES AND STROKE (NPCDCS) WAS CONCEIVED ON PILOT BASIS AT GAYA, BIHAR, TO PROVIDE INTEGRATIVE TREATMENT FOR NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASE PATIENTS AND TO MANAGE THE BURDEN OF NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES IN INDIA. OBJECTIVES: THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ANALYZE THE EFFECT OF AYURVEDA INTERVENTION, LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AND YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES UNDER NPCDCS-AYUSH INTEGRATION PROJECT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A MULTI-CENTRIC, OPEN-LABELED, PROSPECTIVE, COMPARATIVE CLINICAL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED AT 17 COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS AND 1 DISTRICT HOSPITAL. POPULATION OVER 30 YEARS OF AGE WAS SCREENED AND PREDIABETIC OR TYPE 2 DIABETIC INDIVIDUALS WERE ENROLLED IN TWO COHORTS, I.E., PRE-DIABETIC (COHORT A) AND TYPE 2 DIABETIC (COHORT B). EACH COHORT WAS FURTHER DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: GROUP A1 WAS ADVISED FOR LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AND YOGA AND GROUP A2 WAS GIVEN AYURVEDA MEDICATION IN ADDITION TO LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AND YOGA. SIMILARLY, GROUP B1 WAS ADVISED FOR LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AND YOGA ALONG WITH ALLOPATHIC MEDICATION AND GROUP B2 WAS GIVEN AYURVEDA MEDICATION, I.E., MAMAJJAKA, AMALAKI AND GUDUCHI POWDER IN ADDITION TO LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AND YOGA ALONG WITH ALLOPATHIC MEDICATION. TREATMENT WAS GIVEN FOR 6 MONTHS. DATA WERE ANALYZED THROUGH PAIRED T-TEST. RESULTS: A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION WAS OBSERVED IN FASTING BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL IN GROUPS A2 AND B2 (P = 0.001) AND ALSO IN THE POSTPRANDIAL BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL IN GROUPS A2 AND B2 (P = 0.001). FURTHER, IMPROVEMENT IN SUBJECTIVE SYMPTOMS SUCH AS POLYURIA, POLYDIPSIA, POLYPHAGIA, BLURRED VISION AND WEAKNESS WAS FOUND IN ALL THE GROUPS, WHILE NON-HEALING ULCER DOES NOT SHOW ANY IMPROVEMENT. CONCLUSION: THE STUDY REVEALS THAT AYURVEDA INTERVENTION, I.E., MAMAJJAKA CHURNA (1 G), AMALAKI CHURNA (3 G) AND GUDUCHI CHURNA (3 G) TWO TIMES A DAY EFFECTIVELY CONTROLS BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL IN PRE-DIABETIC AND TYPE 2 DIABETIC PATIENTS AND IMPROVES THE DISEASE MANAGEMENT WITH LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION AND YOGASANA AS WELL AS WITH ALLOPATHIC TREATMENT.	2019	
                                                                                                                                                                                       
9  479  40 CLINICAL EFFECT OF NIRGUNDI PATRA PINDA SWEDA AND ASHWAGANDHADI GUGGULU YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT OF SANDHIGATA VATA (OSTEOARTHRITIS). SANDHIGATA VATA IS ONE AMONG THE 80 NANATMAJA VATA VYADHIES. SANDHIGATA VATA AND OSTEOARTHRITIS HAVE COMMON SYMPTOMS, AND HENCE, BOTH ARE CONSIDERED AS SIMILAR ENTITIES BY A MAJORITY OF AYURVEDIC SCHOLARS AND SAME HAS BEEN ADOPTED HERE. OSTEOARTHRITIS IS THE MOST COMMON JOINT DISEASE AMONG HUMAN BEINGS TODAY. IN THIS STUDY, A TOTAL OF 116 PATIENTS WERE REGISTERED, OUT OF THEM 101 PATIENTS HAD COMPLETED THE FULL COURSE OF TREATMENT, WHILE 15 PATIENTS LEFT AGAINST MEDICAL ADVICE. THE 101 PATIENTS OF SANDHIGATA VATA WERE TREATED IN TWO GROUPS. GROUP A: IN THIS GROUP 50 PATIENTS OF SANDHIGATA VATA WERE TREATED WITH NIRGUNDI PATRA PINDA SWEDA FOR 21 DAYS AND ASHWAGANDHADI GUGGULU YOGA3 G/DAY FOR 45 DAYS WAS GIVEN ORALLY. GROUP B: IN THIS GROUP 51 PATIENTS OF SANDHIGATA VATA WERE TREATED WITH ONLY ASHWAGANDHADI GUGGULU YOGA 3 G/DAY FOR 45 DAYS. TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF THE THERAPY OBJECTIVELY, ALL THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS OF SANDHIGATA VATA WERE GIVEN A SCORE, DEPENDING UPON THEIR SEVERITY. ALSO FUNCTIONAL TESTS LIKE WALKING TIME, CLIMBING STAIRS, AND JOINT MOVEMENT, WERE MEASURED AS A CRITERIA FOR ASSESSMENT. BOTH THE GROUPS SHOWED GOOD RESULTS, BUT GROUP B SHOWED BETTER RESULTS IN COMPARISON TO GROUP A.	2011

THEY WERE THEN COMPARED WITH A CONTROL GROUP OF 53 PATIENTS WITH ASTHMA MATCHED FOR AGE, SEX, AND TYPE AND SEVERITY OF ASTHMA, WHO CONTINUED TO TAKE THEIR USUAL DRUGS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER IMPROVEMENT IN THE GROUP WHO PRACTISED YOGA IN THE WEEKLY NUMBER OF ATTACKS OF ASTHMA, SCORES FOR DRUG TREATMENT, AND PEAK FLOW RATE. THIS STUDY SHOWS THE EFFICACY OF YOGA IN THE LONG TERM MANAGEMENT OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA, BUT THE PHYSIOLOGICAL BASIS FOR THIS BENEFICIAL EFFECT NEEDS TO BE EXAMINED IN MORE DETAIL.	1985	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
13 1665  27 NATUROPATHY AND YOGA FOR IMPROVING QUALITY OF LIFE IN PEMPHIGUS VULGARIS AND MANAGING CO-MORBID TYPE 2 DIABETES: A CASE REPORT. A 57 YEARS OLD MALE PATIENT WAS ADMITTED TO AN INPATIENT NATUROPATHY AND YOGA (N&Y) HOSPITAL, DIAGNOSED WITH PEMPHIGUS VULGARIS (PV) FOR ONE YEAR AND CO-MORBID TYPE 2 DIABETES (T2DM) FOR 10 YEARS, ASSOCIATED WITH POOR QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL). HE WAS ADMINISTERED N&Y THERAPIES FOR 10 DAYS, ALONG WITH CONVENTIONAL MEDICINES. THERE WAS IMPROVED QOL AND REDUCED DOSAGE OF INSULIN, ALONG WITH REDUCTION IN BODY WEIGHT. THESE CHANGES WERE SUSTAINED AND IMPROVED FURTHER DURING THE 60-DAY FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO IMPROVEMENT IN THE SKIN LESIONS, THE IMPROVEMENT IN QOL INDICATE A POSSIBLE ROLE OF N&Y IN MANAGEMENT OF PV AND T2DM. THIS CASE REPORT ALSO WARRANTS FURTHER STUDIES FOR N&Y IN THE MANAGEMENT OF DERMATOLOGICAL CONDITIONS AS WELL AS METABOLIC SYNDROME.	2020

METHODS: 30 SUBJECTS RECRUITED TO AYURVEDA AND YOGA (AY) GROUP UNDERWENT TRADITIONAL PANCHAKARMA (BIO-PURIFICATORY PROCESS) USING THERAPEUTIC PURGATION FOLLOWED BY YOGA THERAPY, WHILE 30 SUBJECTS OF CONTROL (CT) GROUP CONTINUED ON SYMPTOMATIC TREATMENT (NSAID'S) FOR 90 DAYS. BODY CONSTITUTION QUESTIONNAIRE WAS ADMINISTERED TO BOTH GROUPS. THE OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED SYMPTOM CHECK LIST, COMPREHENSIVE HEADACHE RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE QUESTIONNAIRE AND VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE. RESULTS: FORTY-SIX (76.6%) OUT OF 60 SUBJECTS BELONGING TO BOTH GROUPS HAD PITTA BASED BODY CONSTITUTION. FOLLOWING 90 DAYS OF INTERVENTION THE AY GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN MIGRAINE SYMPTOMS INCLUDING PAIN INTENSITY (P<.001) AND IMPROVEMENT IN HEADACHE RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE (P<.001). THE CT GROUP SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE (P>.05). CONCLUSION: TRADITIONAL AYURVEDA ALONG WITH YOGA THERAPY REDUCES SYMPTOMS, INTENSITY OF PAIN AND IMPROVES QUALITY OF LIFE IN MIGRAINE PATIENTS.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
17 1123  28 EFFICACY OF NATUROPATHY AND YOGA IN BRONCHIAL ASTHMA. THE AIM OF THE STUDY WAS TO TEST THE EFFICACY OF A ONE MONTH IN-PATIENT NATUROPATHY AND YOGA PROGRAMME FOR PATIENTS WITH ASTHMA. RETROSPECTIVE DATA OF 159 BRONCHIAL ASTHMA PATIENTS, UNDERGOING THE NATUROPATHY AND YOGA PROGRAMME, WAS ANALYZED FOR FORCED VITAL CAPACITY, FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME AT THE END OF 1 SECOND, MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE ON ADMISSION, 11TH DAY, ON DISCHARGE AND ONCE IN THREE MONTHS FOR THREE YEARS. THE PAIRED SAMPLE T TEST RESULTS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE FORCED VITAL CAPACITY AND FORCED EXPIRATORY VOLUME FROM THE DATE OF ADMISSION UP TO 6TH MONTH (P < 0.0035) POST BONFERRONI CORRECTION. MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY VENTILATION SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FROM ADMISSION TILL THE DATE OF DISCHARGE (P < 0.0035) AND PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FROM ADMISSION TILL THE 36TH MONTH OF FOLLOW-UP (P < 0.0035), POST BONFERRONI CORRECTION. THIS VALIDATED THE BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF COMBINING NATUROPATHY AND YOGA FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
18  316  26 AN INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY FOR BRONCHIAL ASTHMA: A 3-54-MONTH PROSPECTIVE STUDY. AFTER AN INITIAL INTEGRATED YOGA TRAINING PROGRAM OF 2 TO 4 WEEKS, 570 BRONCHIAL ASTHMATICS WERE FOLLOWED UP FOR 3 TO 54 MONTHS. THE TRAINING CONSISTED OF YOGA PRACTICES--YOGASANAS, PRANAYAMA, MEDITATION, AND KRIYAS--AND THEORY OF YOGA. RESULTS SHOW HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN MOST OF THE SPECIFIC PARAMETERS. THE REGULAR PRACTITIONERS SHOWED THE GREATEST IMPROVEMENT. PEAK EXPIRATORY FLOW RATE (PFR) VALUES SHOWED SIGNIFICANT MOVEMENT OF PATIENTS TOWARD NORMALCY AFTER YOGA, AND 72, 69, AND 66% OF THE PATIENTS HAVE STOPPED OR REDUCED PARENTERAL, ORAL, AND CORTISONE MEDICATION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE RESULTS ESTABLISH THE LONG-TERM EFFICACY OF THE INTEGRATED APPROACH OF YOGA THERAPY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF BRONCHIAL ASTHMA.	1986	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
19  453  35 CHANGES IN MIDAS, PERCEIVED STRESS, FRONTALIS MUSCLE ACTIVITY AND NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS USAGE IN PATIENTS WITH MIGRAINE HEADACHE WITHOUT AURA FOLLOWING AYURVEDA AND YOGA COMPARED TO CONTROLS: AN OPEN LABELED NON-RANDOMIZED STUDY. BACKGROUND: THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE USE OF COMPLEMENTARY AND INTEGRATIVE MEDICINE TO PROVIDE LONG-TERM HEALING SOLUTIONS IN MIGRAINE HEADACHE PATIENTS. KNOWING THE LIMITATIONS OF CONVENTIONAL MEDICAL APPROACH, THE PRESENT STUDY EVALUATED THE INFLUENCE OF TWO INDIAN TRADITIONAL SYSTEMS OF MEDICINE ON MIGRAINE-RELATED DISABILITY, AUTONOMIC VARIABLES, PERCEIVED STRESS, AND MUSCLE ACTIVITY IN PATIENTS WITH MIGRAINE HEADACHE WITHOUT AURA. METHODS: THIRTY SUBJECTS RECRUITED TO THE AYURVEDA AND YOGA (AY) GROUP UNDERWENT TRADITIONAL PANCHAKARMA (BIO-PURIFICATION) USING THERAPEUTIC PURGATION FOLLOWED BY YOGA THERAPY, WHILE 30 SUBJECTS OF CONTROL (CT) GROUP CONTINUED ON SYMPTOMATIC TREATMENT (NON-STEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS [NSAID'S]) FOR 90 DAYS. MIGRAINE DISABILITY ASSESSMENT SCORE, PERCEIVED STRESS, HEART RATE VARIABILITY (HRV), AND SURFACE ELECTROMYOGRAPHY (EMG) OF FRONTALIS MUSCLE WERE MEASURED ON DAY 1, DAY 30, AND DAY 90 IN BOTH GROUPS. RESULTS: SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN MIGRAINE DISABILITY AND PERCEIVED STRESS SCORES WERE OBSERVED IN THE AY GROUP. THE LOW-FREQUENCY COMPONENT OF THE HRV DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY, THE HIGH-FREQUENCY COMPONENT INCREASED AND THEIR RATIO SHOWED IMPROVED SYMPATHOVAGAL BALANCE. THE EMG SHOWED DECREASED ACTIVITY OF THE FRONTALIS MUSCLE IN THE AY GROUP COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSION: THE INTEGRATIVE APPROACH COMBINING AYURVEDA AND YOGA THERAPY REDUCES MIGRAINE-RELATED DISABILITY, PERCEIVED STRESS, SYMPATHETIC AROUSAL, AND MUSCLE TENSION.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
20  353  36 ASSESSMENT OF THE QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA, BEFORE AND AFTER YOGA: A RANDOMISED TRIAL. YOGA WHICH IS USED AS AN ADJUNCT TREATMENT FOR BRONCHIAL ASTHMA IS GAINING POPULARITY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON QUALITY OF LIFE IN PATIENTS WITH BRONCHIAL ASTHMA. 120 NON-SMOKING MALE AND FEMALE PATIENTS OF ASTHMA IN THE AGE GROUP OF 17-50 YEARS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO TWO GROUPS I.E. GROUP A (YOGA GROUP) AND GROUP B (CONTROL GROUP). ALL PATIENTS REMAINED ON THEIR PRESCRIBED MEDICATION, BUT GROUP A PATIENTS PRACTICED YOGA BREATHING EXERCISES FOR 8 WEEKS.

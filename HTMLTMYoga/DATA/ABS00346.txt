1  346 75 ASSESSING FIDELITY OF CORE COMPONENTS IN A MINDFULNESS AND YOGA INTERVENTION FOR URBAN YOUTH: APPLYING THE CORE PROCESS. IN THE PAST YEARS, THE NUMBER OF MINDFULNESS-BASED INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION PROGRAMS HAS INCREASED STEADILY. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE INTENDED PROGRAM OUTCOMES, PROGRAM IMPLEMENTERS NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE ESSENTIAL AND INDISPENSABLE COMPONENTS THAT DEFINE A PROGRAM'S SUCCESS. THIS CHAPTER DESCRIBES THE COMPLEX PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING THE CORE COMPONENTS OF A MINDFULNESS AND YOGA PROGRAM FOR URBAN EARLY ADOLESCENTS THROUGH THE SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF FIDELITY OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THE INTERVENTION. THE AUTHORS ILLUSTRATE THE CORE PROCESS [(C) CONCEPTUALIZE CORE COMPONENTS; (O) OPERATIONALIZE AND MEASURE; (R) RUN ANALYSES AND REVIEW IMPLEMENTATION FINDINGS; AND (E) ENHANCE AND REFINE], BASED ON DATA GAINED FROM A MINDFULNESS AND YOGA INTERVENTION STUDY CONDUCTED AS A COMMUNITY-ACADEMIC PARTNERSHIP IN BALTIMORE CITY.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
2 1712 23 PERCEIVED BENEFITS OF YOGA AMONG URBAN SCHOOL STUDENTS: A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS. THIS STUDY REPORTS ON THE FINDINGS OF A QUALITATIVE EVALUATION OF A YOGA INTERVENTION PROGRAM FOR URBAN MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL YOUTH IN NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC AND CHARTER SCHOOLS. SIX FOCUS GROUPS WERE CONDUCTED WITH STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATED IN A YEAR-LONG YOGA PROGRAM TO DETERMINE THEIR PERCEPTIONS OF MENTAL AND PHYSICAL BENEFITS AS WELL AS BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES. RESULTS SHOW THAT STUDENTS PERCEIVED THE BENEFITS OF YOGA AS INCREASED SELF-REGULATION, MINDFULNESS, SELF-ESTEEM, PHYSICAL CONDITIONING, ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE, AND STRESS REDUCTION. BARRIERS AND CHALLENGES FOR A YOGA PRACTICE INCLUDE LACK OF TIME AND SPACE. THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE BENEFITS EXPERIENCED ARE INTERRELATED TO ONE ANOTHER IS DISCUSSED. SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH AND SCHOOL-BASED PROGRAMMING ARE ALSO OFFERED.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
3 2600 15 YOGA FOR OSTEOARTHRITIS: NURSING AND RESEARCH CONSIDERATIONS. OSTEOARTHRITIS (OA) IS A LEADING CAUSE OF PAIN AND DISABILITY WORLDWIDE. CURRENT TREATMENT GUIDELINES RECOMMEND NONPHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES SUCH AS YOGA FOR FIRSTLINE TREATMENT OF OA. YOGA IS A PROMISING MIND-BODY PRACTICE THAT INCLUDES PHYSICAL POSTURES, BREATHING PRACTICES, AND MEDITATIVE MENTAL FOCUS. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS THE CURRENT EVIDENCE, AS WELL AS A PROPOSED CONCEPTUAL MODEL FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. CURRENT RESEARCH ON YOGA FOR OA IS SCANT BUT PROMISING, SHOWING SOME EVIDENCE OF REDUCED PAIN, SLEEP DISTURBANCE, AND DISABILITY. THE CONCEPTUAL MODEL DESCRIBED HERE PROPOSES MUSCULOSKELETAL EFFECTS (STRENGTHENING, FLEXIBILITY, RELAXATION), REDUCTION OF AUTONOMIC AROUSAL, AND THERAPEUTIC COGNITIVE PATTERNS (DISTRACTION, MINDFULNESS) AS POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT MECHANISMS OF YOGA. THIS ARTICLE ALSO DESCRIBES CONSIDERATIONS FOR PATIENTS AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WHEN EVALUATING THE POTENTIAL USEFULNESS AND SAFETY OF YOGA PROGRAMS: YOGA STYLE, INSTRUCTOR QUALIFICATIONS, AND AMOUNT OF TIME SPENT IN YOGA PRACTICE.	2012

7 1950 20 SCHOOL-BASED YOGA PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES: A SURVEY. CONTEXT: SUBSTANTIAL INTEREST HAS BEGUN TO EMERGE AROUND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF YOGA INTERVENTIONS IN SCHOOLS. RESEARCHERS HAVE FOUND THAT YOGA PRACTICES MAY ENHANCE SKILLS SUCH AS SELF-REGULATION AND PROSOCIAL BEHAVIOR, AND LEAD TO IMPROVEMENTS IN STUDENTS' PERFORMANCE. THESE RESEARCHERS, THEREFORE, HAVE PROPOSED THAT CONTEMPLATIVE PRACTICES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PLAY A CRUCIAL ROLE IN ENHANCING THE QUALITY OF US PUBLIC EDUCATION. OBJECTIVE: THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO PROVIDE A SUMMARY AND COMPARISON OF SCHOOL-BASED YOGA PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES. DESIGN: ONLINE, LISTSERV, AND DATABASE SEARCHES WERE CONDUCTED TO IDENTIFY PROGRAMS, AND INFORMATION WAS COLLECTED REGARDING EACH PROGRAM'S SCOPE OF WORK, CURRICULUM CHARACTERISTICS, TEACHER-CERTIFICATION AND TRAINING REQUIREMENTS, IMPLEMENTATION MODELS, MODES OF OPERATION, AND GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS. SETTING: THE ONLINE, LISTSERV, AND DATABASE SEARCHES TOOK PLACE IN BOSTON, MA, USA, AND NEW HAVEN, CT, USA. RESULTS: THIRTY-SIX PROGRAMS WERE IDENTIFIED THAT OFFER YOGA IN MORE THAN 940 SCHOOLS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES, AND MORE THAN 5400 INSTRUCTORS HAVE BEEN TRAINED BY THESE PROGRAMS TO OFFER YOGA IN EDUCATIONAL SETTINGS. DESPITE SOME VARIABILITY IN THE EXACT MODE OF IMPLEMENTATION, TRAINING REQUIREMENTS, LOCATIONS SERVED, AND GRADES COVERED, THE MAJORITY OF THE PROGRAMS SHARE A COMMON GOAL OF TEACHING 4 BASIC ELEMENTS OF YOGA: (1) PHYSICAL POSTURES, (2) BREATHING EXERCISES, (3) RELAXATION TECHNIQUES, AND (4) MINDFULNESS AND MEDITATION PRACTICES. THE PROGRAMS ALSO TEACH A VARIETY OF ADDITIONAL EDUCATIONAL, SOCIAL-EMOTIONAL, AND DIDACTIC TECHNIQUES TO ENHANCE STUDENTS' MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH AND BEHAVIOR. CONCLUSIONS: THE FACT THAT THE PRESENT STUDY WAS ABLE TO FIND A RELATIVELY LARGE NUMBER OF FORMAL, SCHOOL-BASED YOGA PROGRAMS CURRENTLY BEING IMPLEMENTED IN THE UNITED STATES SUGGESTS THAT THE PROGRAMS MAY BE ACCEPTABLE AND FEASIBLE TO IMPLEMENT. THE RESULTS ALSO SUGGEST THAT THE POPULARITY OF SCHOOL-BASED YOGA PROGRAMS MAY CONTINUE TO GROW.	2015

13 1992 20 STAFF PERSPECTIVES REGARDING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A YOGA INTERVENTION WITH CHRONIC PAIN SELF-MANAGEMENT IN A CLINICAL SETTING. CHRONIC PAIN AFFECTS MILLIONS OF AMERICANS AND CAN BE ADDRESSED THROUGH MULTIPLE MODALITIES, INTERVENTIONS, AND STRATEGIES. YOGA AND SELF-MANAGEMENT HAVE BEEN PROVEN EFFECTIVE IN TREATING CHRONIC PAIN, BUT LITTLE RESEARCH HAS BEEN CONDUCTED ON THE FEASIBILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION BARRIERS RELATED TO THESE ALTERNATIVE INTERVENTION FORMS. IN OUR QUALITATIVE STUDY, WE EXAMINED STAFF PERCEPTIONS REGARDING THE FEASIBILITY OF IMPLEMENTING YOGA ALONG WITH ESTABLISHED SELF-MANAGEMENT AT A PAIN MANAGEMENT CLINIC IN COLORADO. WE UTILIZED THE IMPLEMENTATION DRIVERS OF COMPETENCY, ORGANIZATIONAL, AND LEADERSHIP, AND OUR ADDED HYPOTHETICAL DRIVER TO EXPLORE BARRIERS AND FACILITATORS RELATED TO PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT POSITIVE STAFF AND PATIENT ATTITUDES WERE CRUCIAL FOR SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION. WE ALSO IDENTIFIED PHYSICAL SPACE, TRANSPORTATION, AND SUPPORTIVE LEADERSHIP AS NECESSARY COMPONENTS OF PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION. FURTHER RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO EXAMINE BARRIERS SUCH AS FUNDING TO ENSURE INTERVENTION SUSTAINABILITY AND THE NEED FOR ADEQUATE STAFFING.	2017	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
14 2646 19 YOGA FOR YOUTH IN PAIN: THE UCLA PEDIATRIC PAIN PROGRAM MODEL. CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS, AND YOUNG ADULTS DO NOT TYPICALLY FEATURE IN CLINICS, STUDIES, AND MAINSTREAM NOTIONS OF CHRONIC PAIN. YET MANY YOUNG PEOPLE EXPERIENCE DEBILITATING PAIN FOR EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME. CHRONIC PAIN IN THESE FORMATIVE YEARS MAY BE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO TREAT IN ORDER FOR YOUNG PATIENTS TO MAINTAIN LIFE TASKS AND TO PREVENT PROTRACTED DISABILITY. THE PEDIATRIC PAIN PROGRAM AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES, IS A MULTIDISCIPLINARY TREATMENT PROGRAM DESIGNED FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC PAIN AND THEIR FAMILIES. WE OFFER BOTH CONVENTIONAL AND COMPLEMENTARY MEDICINE TO TREAT THE WHOLE INDIVIDUAL. THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE WORK UNDERTAKEN IN THE CLINIC AND OUR NEWLY DEVELOPED YOGA FOR YOUTH RESEARCH PROGRAM. THE CLINICAL AND RESEARCH PROGRAMS FILL A CRITICAL NEED TO PROVIDE SERVICE TO YOUTH WITH CHRONIC PAIN AND TO SCIENTIFICALLY STUDY ONE OF THE MORE POPULAR COMPLEMENTARY TREATMENTS WE OFFER, IYENGAR YOGA.	2012	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
15  380 20 BECOMING CONNECTED: THE LIVED EXPERIENCE OF YOGA PARTICIPATION AFTER STROKE. PURPOSE: TO INVESTIGATE THE PERSONAL EXPERIENCES AND PERCEIVED OUTCOMES OF A YOGA PROGRAMME FOR STROKE SURVIVORS. METHOD: THIS ARTICLE REPORTS ON A PRELIMINARY STUDY USING QUALITATIVE METHODS TO INVESTIGATE THE PERSONAL EXPERIENCES AND PERCEIVED OUTCOMES OF A YOGA PROGRAMME. NINE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD EXPERIENCED STROKE WERE INTERVIEWED FOLLOWING A 10-WEEK YOGA PROGRAMME INVOLVING MOVEMENT, BREATHING AND MEDITATION PRACTICES. AN INTERPRETATIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL APPROACH WAS USED TO DETERMINE MEANINGS ATTACHED TO YOGA PARTICIPATION AS WELL AS PERCEPTIONS OF OUTCOMES. RESULTS: INTERPRETATIVE THEMES EVOLVING FROM THE DATA WERE ORGANISED AROUND A BIO-PSYCHOSOCIAL MODEL OF HEALTH BENEFITS FROM YOGA. EMERGENT THEMES FROM THE ANALYSIS INCLUDED: GREATER SENSATION; FEELING CALMER AND BECOMING CONNECTED. THESE THEMES RESPECTIVELY REVEALED PERCEIVED PHYSICAL IMPROVEMENTS IN TERMS OF STRENGTH, RANGE OF MOVEMENT OR WALKING ABILITY, AN IMPROVED SENSE OF CALMNESS AND THE POSSIBILITY FOR RECONNECTING AND ACCEPTING A DIFFERENT BODY. CONCLUSION: THE STUDY HAS GENERATED ORIGINAL FINDINGS THAT SUGGEST THAT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD A STROKE YOGA PARTICIPATION CAN PROVIDE A NUMBER OF MEANINGFUL PHYSICAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL AND SOCIAL BENEFITS AND SUPPORT THE RATIONALE FOR INCORPORATING YOGA AND MEDITATION-BASED PRACTICES INTO REHABILITATION PROGRAMMES.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
16 2453 16 YOGA AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS: A GUIDE FOR CLINICIANS. YOGA IS BEING USED BY A GROWING NUMBER OF YOUTH AND ADULTS AS A MEANS OF IMPROVING OVERALL HEALTH AND FITNESS. THERE IS ALSO A PROGRESSIVE TREND TOWARD USE OF YOGA AS A MIND-BODY COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE INTERVENTION TO IMPROVE SPECIFIC PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. TO PROVIDE CLINICIANS WITH THERAPEUTICALLY USEFUL INFORMATION ABOUT YOGA, THE EVIDENCE EVALUATING YOGA AS AN EFFECTIVE INTERVENTION FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH HEALTH PROBLEMS IS REVIEWED AND SUMMARIZED. A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF YOGA AND YOGA THERAPY IS PRESENTED ALONG WITH YOGA RESOURCES AND PRACTICAL STRATEGIES FOR CLINICAL PRACTITIONERS TO USE WITH THEIR PATIENTS. THE MAJORITY OF AVAILABLE STUDIES WITH CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS SUGGEST BENEFITS TO USING YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION AND SHOW VERY FEW ADVERSE EFFECTS. THESE RESULTS MUST BE INTERPRETED AS PRELIMINARY FINDINGS BECAUSE MANY OF THE STUDIES HAVE METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS THAT PREVENT STRONG CONCLUSIONS FROM BEING DRAWN. YOGA APPEARS PROMISING AS A COMPLEMENTARY THERAPY FOR CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS. FURTHER INFORMATION ABOUT HOW TO APPLY IT MOST EFFECTIVELY AND MORE COORDINATED RESEARCH EFFORTS ARE NEEDED.	2010	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
17 2265 15 THE PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE FOR OLDER ADULTS: EVIDENCE AND GUIDELINES. YOGA IS AN EFFECTIVE COMPLEMENTARY APPROACH TO HEALTH MAINTENANCE AND PROMOTION FOR OLDER ADULTS AND HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED TO SUPPORT MANY DIMENSIONS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING, FROM EVERYDAY STRESS TO ANXIETY, DEPRESSION, AND COPING WITH HEALTH CHALLENGES. YOGA HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE EVEN MORE EFFECTIVE WHEN CONSCIOUSLY AND SYSTEMATICALLY INTEGRATED INTO AN INDIVIDUAL'S OVERALL SELF-CARE AND MEDICAL CARE PROGRAM, THROUGH DELIBERATE AND OPEN DIALOGUE AMONG PATIENTS, HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS, AND YOGA PROFESSIONALS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO (1) BRIEFLY REVIEW THE PSYCHOLOGICAL BENEFITS OF YOGA PRACTICE FOR OLDER ADULTS; (2) OUTLINE PRACTICE GUIDELINES FOR OLDER ADULT YOGA, INCLUDING KEY POSTURES; AND (3) PROVIDE SOME BASIC PRACTICAL GUIDELINES FOR BOTH HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS REFERRING PATIENTS TO YOGA AND YOGA TEACHERS INTERESTED IN WORKING WITH OLDER ADULTS.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
18  102 17 A PHYSICIAN'S GUIDE TO RECOMMENDING YOGA. THE POPULARITY OF YOGA IN THE UNITED STATES AND ACROSS THE GLOBE HAS BEEN STEADILY INCREASING OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DECADES. THE INTEREST IN YOGA AS A THERAPEUTIC LIFESTYLE TOOL HAS ALSO GROWN WITHIN THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY DURING THIS TIME. HOWEVER, THE WIDE RANGE OF STYLES AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC CAN MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR PATIENTS AND PHYSICIANS ALIKE TO CHOOSE THE ONE THAT WILL OFFER THE MOST BENEFIT. THIS GUIDE WAS CREATED TO ASSIST PHYSICIANS IN MAKING INFORMED RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PATIENTS PRACTICING YOGA IN THE COMMUNITY. WHEN THE MOST SUITABLE STYLE IS SELECTED, YOGA CAN BE AN EXTREMELY USEFUL LIFESTYLE TOOL FOR PATIENTS SEEKING TO IMPROVE FITNESS AND DEVELOP A MINDFULNESS-BASED PRACTICE.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
19 1280 18 GENERIC YOGA MODULES FOR CLINICAL AND RESEARCH SETTINGS-NEED OF THE HOUR. YOGA-BASED INTERVENTIONS OFFER SIGNIFICANT PROMISE IN HEALTHCARE. HOWEVER, META-ANALYSES OF VARIOUS YOGA TRIALS SUGGEST THAT COMPARISONS OF TRIALS ARE EITHER NOT POSSIBLE OR DIFFICULT DUE TO HETEROGENEITY IN THERAPEUTIC YOGA INTERVENTIONS. ALSO, IN VIEW OF EMERGING EVIDENCE FOR THE ROLE OF THERAPEUTIC YOGA, IT IS IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY THE SPECIFICITY AND VALIDITY OF VARIOUS YOGA COMPONENTS BEING USED IN DIFFERENT TRIALS. EFFORTS IN THIS DIRECTION WILL BE FRUITFUL ONLY IF A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH IS ADOPTED TO DEVELOP YOGA PROGRAMS FOR VARIOUS AILMENTS. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR A "GENERIC YOGA" CONCEPT FOR DESIGNING A THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAM FOR PARTICULAR HEALTH ISSUES, WITH THE OBJECTIVES OF PROMOTING SCIENTIFIC GROWTH OF THERAPEUTIC APPLICATIONS OF YOGA AND WIDESPREAD APPLICATION OF STANDARDIZED THERAPEUTIC YOGA PROGRAMS WITHIN A BIOMEDICAL FRAMEWORK. THIS GENERIC THERAPEUTIC YOGA WILL ESSENTIALLY HIGHLIGHT THE DEVELOPMENT-VALIDATION PROCESS OF UNCOPYRIGHTED YOGA PROGRAMS; THEIR COMPONENTS, BENEFITS, AND POSSIBLE SIDE-EFFECTS; AND REQUIREMENT FOR NEED-BASED MODIFICATIONS.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
20 2711 18 YOGA KERNELS: A PUBLIC HEALTH MODEL FOR DEVELOPING AND DISSEMINATING EVIDENCE-BASED YOGA PRACTICES. MANY PEOPLE ARE DRAWN TO YOGA FOR ITS POTENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS. WITH ITS RISING POPULARITY, YOGA COULD BECOME A WIDELY USED PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION, BUT ITS SUCCESS DEPENDS ON FINDING EVIDENCE-BASED YOGA PRACTICES THAT ARE ACCEPTABLE AND FEASIBLE FOR A LARGE SEGMENT OF THE POPULATION. COMPLEXITY AND VARIABILITY CREATE BARRIERS TO THE ADOPTION AND MAINTENANCE OF YOGA PRACTICES. IN AN EFFORT TO IMPROVE THE STUDY, ADOPTION, AND MAINTENANCE OF THERAPEUTIC PRACTICES USED IN THE CONTEXT OF PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS, WE INTRODUCE THE CONCEPT OF "YOGA KERNELS," DEFINED AS DISCRETE, EVIDENCE-BASED YOGA PRACTICES THAT ARE AMENABLE TO SCIENTIFIC STUDY AND CAN BE EFFECTIVELY DISSEMINATED AS A PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION. YOGA IS REVIEWED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF A PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION USING THE REACH EFFECTIVENESS ADOPTION IMPLEMENTATION AND MAINTENANCE (RE-AIM) MODEL. THIS MODEL IS DESIGNED TO IMPROVE THE SUCCESSFUL ADOPTION AND MAINTENANCE OF GENERALIZABLE, EVIDENCE-BASED INTERVENTIONS. IN RESPONSE TO THE CHALLENGES TO THE ADOPTION AND MAINTENANCE OF YOGA PRACTICES, WE PROPOSE THAT A POTENTIALLY FRUITFUL DIRECTION FOR YOGA RESEARCH IS MOVING AWAY FROM STUDYING YOGA CLASSES TO STUDYING SPECIFIC YOGA PRACTICES THAT ARE SIMPLER AND EASIER FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO USE. YOGA KERNELS COULD BE A UNIFYING CONCEPT TO IDENTIFY THERAPEUTIC USES OF YOGA AND HELP PEOPLE ADOPT AND MAINTAIN THESE PRACTICES AS PART OF A SYSTEMATIC PUBLIC HEALTH STRATEGY.	2019

1 2100 164 THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON ARM VOLUME, STRENGTH, AND RANGE OF MOTION IN WOMEN AT RISK FOR BREAST CANCER-RELATED LYMPHEDEMA. OBJECTIVES: TO ASSESS THE FEASIBILITY, SAFETY, AND INITIAL ESTIMATES OF EFFICACY OF A YOGA PROGRAM IN POSTOPERATIVE CARE FOR WOMEN AT HIGH RISK FOR BREAST CANCER-RELATED LYMPHEDEMA (BCRL). DESIGN: SINGLE-GROUP PRETEST-POST-TEST DESIGN. SETTINGS/LOCATION: PATIENTS WERE RECRUITED FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO CAROL FRANC BUCK BREAST CARE CENTER. SUBJECTS: TWENTY-ONE WOMEN WERE ENROLLED IN THE STUDY. WOMEN WERE >18 YEARS OF AGE, HAD UNDERGONE SURGICAL TREATMENT FOR BREAST CANCER, AND WERE AT HIGH RISK FOR BCRL. INTERVENTION: THE WOMEN PARTICIPATED IN AN ASHTANGA YOGA INTERVENTION FOR 8 WEEKS. SESSIONS CONSISTED OF ONCE/WEEK INSTRUCTOR-LED PRACTICE AND ONCE/WEEK HOME PRACTICE. PARTICULAR ATTENTION WAS GIVEN TO POSES THAT EMPHASIZED UPPER BODY STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY, WHILE AVOIDING SIGNIFICANT TIME WITH THE UPPER EXTREMITY (UE) IN A DEPENDENT POSITION. OUTCOME MEASURES: UE VOLUME WAS ASSESSED THROUGH CIRCUMFERENTIAL FOREARM MEASUREMENT, WHICH WAS CONVERTED TO VOLUME USING THE FORMULA FOR A TRUNCATED CONE. RANGE OF MOTION (ROM) WAS ASSESSED FOR THE SHOULDERS, ELBOWS, AND WRISTS, USING A STANDARD GONIOMETER. UE STRENGTH WAS ASSESSED FOR SHOULDER ABDUCTION, ELBOW FLEXION, WRIST FLEXION, AND GRIP USING A DYNAMOMETER. RESULTS: TWENTY WOMEN COMPLETED THE YOGA INTERVENTION, WITH 17 RETURNING FOR FINAL ASSESSMENT. MEAN AGE WAS 52 (+/-9.1) YEARS AND BODY MASS INDEX WAS 24.8 (+/-5.1) KG/M(2). POSTINTERVENTION, MEAN VOLUME IN THE AT-RISK UE WAS SLIGHTLY REDUCED (P = 0.397). ROM FOR SHOULDER FLEXION (P < 0.01) AND EXTERNAL ROTATION (P < 0.05) SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED BILATERALLY. SHOULDER ABDUCTION ROM SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED FOR THE UNAFFECTED LIMB (P = 0.001). FOLLOWING INTERVENTION, STRENGTH IMPROVED ON THE AFFECTED SIDE FOR SHOULDER ABDUCTION AND GRIP STRENGTH, AND BILATERALLY FOR ELBOW FLEXION (P < 0.05 FOR ALL). CONCLUSIONS: THESE PRELIMINARY FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT YOGA IS FEASIBLE AND SAFE FOR WOMEN WHO ARE AT RISK FOR BCRL AND MAY RESULT IN SMALL IMPROVEMENTS IN SHOULDER ROM AND UE STRENGTH.	2018	

2  268  35 ACUTE PHYSIOLOGIC EFFECTS OF PERFORMING YOGA IN THE HEAT ON ENERGY EXPENDITURE, RANGE OF MOTION, AND INFLAMMATORY BIOMARKERS. PERFORMING YOGA IN A HEATED ENVIRONMENT (HY) IS A POPULAR EXERCISE MODE PURPORTED TO IMPROVE RANGE OF MOTION (ROM), BODY COMPOSITION, AND AEROBIC FITNESS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS INVESTIGATION WAS TO COMPARE A SESSION OF HY TO ROOM TEMPERATURE YOGA (RTY) WITH REGARDS TO ROM, OXYGEN CONSUMPTION, CALORIC EXPENDITURE, AND BIOMARKERS OF ACUTE STRESS AND INFLAMMATION. SIXTEEN EXPERIENCED YOGA PRACTITIONERS (F14, M2; 40 +/- 11YR; 22.6 +/- 1.8 KG/M(2)) COMPLETED A 1-HOUR STANDARDIZED BIKRAM SEQUENCE IN HY (105 DEGREES F, 40 DEGREES C) AND RTY (74 DEGREES F, 23.3 DEGREES C) CONDITIONS (ORDER OF CONDITIONS RANDOMIZED, HUMIDITY STANDARDIZED AT 40%). INTRA-EXERCISE METABOLIC GAS EXCHANGE AND HEART RATE (HR) WAS MONITORED USING A METABOLIC CART. ROM MEASURES WERE TAKEN PRE AND POST-EXERCISE AT THE ELBOW, SHOULDER, HIP, AND KNEE. CYTOKINES INTERLEUKIN 6,10 (IL-6, IL-10) AND TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR ALPHA (TNF-ALPHA) WERE ANALYZED FROM BLOOD SAMPLES COLLECTED PRE- AND 30-MINUTES POST-EXERCISE. INTRA-EXERCISE METABOLIC GAS EXCHANGE AND HEART RATE (HR) WAS MONITORED USING A METABOLIC CART. BOTH BOUTS ELICITED SIMILAR ACUTE CHANGES IN ROM ALTHOUGH HY ELICITED A GREATER INCREASE IN HIP ABDUCTION (RTYDELTA DEGREES = 2.3 +/- 1.3|HYDELTA DEGREES = 6.6 +/- 1.5; P < 0.05). MEAN VO2, PEAK VO2, %VO2MAX, HR, AND KCAL EXPENDITURE DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN CONDITIONS. RER WAS LOWER DURING THE HY (RTY = 0.95 +/- 0.02| HY = 0.89 +/- 0.02; P < 0.05) WITH A CONCOMITANT ELEVATION IN FAT OXIDATION (RTY = 0.05 +/- 0.01|HY = 0.09 +/- 0.01, G.MIN(-1); P < 0.05) AND DECREASE IN CARBOHYDRATE OXIDATION (RTY = 0.51 +/- 0.04|HY = 0.44 +/- 0.03, G.MIN(-1); P < 0.05). SERUM IL-6 WAS INCREASED (15.5 +/- 8.0-FOLD) FOLLOWING HY ONLY (P < 0.05). HY DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY ELEVATE AEROBIC ENERGY COST COMPARED TO RTY BUT MAY ACUTELY INCREASE FAT SUBSTRATE UTILIZATION AND HIP ROM. FUTURE STUDIES REMAIN NEEDED TO ESTABLISH DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIPS FOR INCLUDING HY OR RTY INTO WELL-ROUNDED FITNESS PROGRAMS.	2020	
                                               
3 1264  35 FLEXIBILITY, FUNCTIONAL AUTONOMY AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) IN ELDERLY YOGA PRACTITIONERS. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE LEVELS OF FLEXIBILITY, FUNCTIONAL AUTONOMY AND QOL IN ELDERLY YOGA PRACTITIONERS. THE SUBJECTS WERE DIVIDED INTO A YOGA GROUP (YG; N = 52; AGE = 66.79 +/- 3.30 YEARS; BMI = 24.77 +/- 3.18) AND CONTROL GROUP (CG; N = 31; AGE = 69.33 +/- 4.84 YEARS; BMI = 24.32 +/- 3.71) AND SUBMITTED TO FLEXIBILITY TESTS THROUGH GONIOMETRY, THE LADEG AUTONOMY PROTOCOL AND QOL, USING THE WHOQOL-OLD QUESTIONNAIRE. REPEATED MEASURES ANOVA SHOWED INCREASES IN ARTICULAR RANGE OF MOTION IN SHOULDER ABDUCTION (DELTA%SA = 14.11%; P = 0.0001), HORIZONTAL SHOULDER EXTENSION (DELTA%HSE = 33.90%; P = 0.0001), LUMBAR SPINE FLEXION (DELTA%LSF = 50.74%; P = 0.0001), HIP FLEXION (DELTA%HF = 35.75%; P = 0.0001), HIP EXTENSION (DELTA%HE = 10.93%; P = 0.021) AND KNEE FLEXION (DELTA%KF = 3.90%; P = 0.001) AND IN THE GDLAM AUTONOMY INDEX (DELTA%AI = -13.67%; P = 0.0001) IN THE YG COMPARED TO THE CG. THE MANN-WHITNEY TEST REVEALED INCREASES IN QOL SCORES IN FACET 1 (DELTA%FAC1 = 9.04%; P=0.043), FACET 5 (DELTA%FAC5 = 51.06%; P = 0.0001) AND IN OVERALL QOL (DELTA%OQOL = 8.13%; P = 0.046) IN THE YG COMPARED TO THE CG. THE REMAINING VARIABLES SHOWED NO SIGNIFICANT INTERGROUP MODIFICATIONS. THUS, THE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT THE REGULAR PRACTICE OF YOGA MAY LEAD TO IMPROVED RANGE OF MOTION IN THE PERFORMANCE OF ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING IN ELDERLY WOMEN.	2011	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
4  550  37 CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF POWER YOGA IN PARKINSON'S DISEASE. OBJECTIVES: TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF A SPECIALLY DESIGNED POWER YOGA PROGRAM (YOGA) ON BRADYKINESIA, RIGIDITY, MUSCULAR PERFORMANCE AND QUALITY OF LIFE IN OLDER PATIENTS WITH PD. DESIGN: RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL. SETTING: UNIVERSITY LABORATORY, US. INTERVENTION: TWENTY-SIX PATIENTS WITH MILD TO MODERATE PD WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A YOGA OR CONTROL GROUP (CON). THE YOGA PROGRAM WAS THREE MONTHS, INCORPORATING TWO SESSIONS/WK OF YOGA CLASSES. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: UPPER AND LOWER LIMB BRADYKINESIA AND RIGIDITY SCORES FROM THE UNIFIED PARKINSON'S DISEASE RATING SCALE, ONE REPETITION MAXIMUMS (1RM) AND PEAK POWERS ON BICEPS CURL, CHEST PRESS, LEG PRESS, HIP ABDUCTION AND SEATED CALF, AND QUALITY OF LIFE (PDQ-39). RESULTS: THE YOGA GROUP PRODUCED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN BOTH UPPER AND LOWER LIMBS BRADYKINESIA SCORES, RIGIDITY SCORE, 1RM FOR ALL 5 MACHINES AND LEG PRESS POWER (P<.05). SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE SEEN IN THE PDQ-39 OVERALL SCORE, MOBILITY AND ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING DOMAIN FOR THE YOGA GROUP. CONCLUSION: THE 3-MONTH YOGA PROGRAM SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BRADYKINESIA AND RIGIDITY, AND INCREASED MUSCLE STRENGTH AND POWER IN OLDER PATIENTS WITH PD. POWER TRAINING IS AN EFFECTIVE TRAINING MODALITY TO IMPROVE PHYSICAL FUNCTION AND QUALITY OF LIFE FOR PD.	2016	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
5 2185  52 THE EFFECTS OF YOGA ON SHOULDER AND SPINAL ACTIONS FOR WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER-RELATED LYMPHOEDEMA OF THE ARM: A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY. BACKGROUND: WE AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF AN 8-WEEK YOGA INTERVENTION ON THE SHOULDER AND SPINAL ACTIONS OF WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER-RELATED ARM LYMPHOEDEMA. METHOD: A RANDOMISED CONTROLLED PILOT TRIAL. THE INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 12) COMPLETED EIGHT WEEKS OF DAILY YOGA SESSIONS WHILE THE CONTROL GROUP (N = 11) CONTINUED WITH BEST CURRENT CARE INCLUDING INFORMATION ON COMPRESSION SLEEVES, SKIN CARE, RISKS OF TEMPERATURE VARIATIONS AND RECOMMENDED SAFE USE OF AFFECTED ARM. LUMBO-PELVIC POSTURE, RANGE OF MOTION (ROM) IN THE SHOULDER AND SPINE, AND STRENGTH IN SHOULDER AND PECTORAL MAJOR AND MINOR, AND SERRATUS ANTERIOR WERE TAKEN AT BASELINE, WEEK 8 AND AFTER A 4-WEEK FOLLOW-UP. OUTCOME ASSESSORS WERE BLINDED TO ALLOCATION. RESULTS: AT WEEK EIGHT THE INTERVENTION GROUP HAD AN IMPROVEMENT IN LUMBO-PELVIC POSTURE, AS INDICATED BY A REDUCTION IN PELVIC OBLIQUITY COMPARED TO THE CONTROL GROUP (MEAN DIFFERENCE = -8.39 DEGREES , 95 % CI: -15.64 TO -1.13 DEGREES , P = 0.023). A SECONDARY FINDING WAS THAT STRENGTH IN SHOULDER ABDUCTION SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED FOLLOWING THE YOGA INTERVENTION IN BOTH THE AFFECTED (9.5 KG; CI: 0.34 TO 18.66, P = 0.042) AND NON-AFFECTED ARM (11.58 KG; CI: 0.25 TO 22.91; P = 0.045). THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN GROUP CHANGES IN ANY ROM MEASURES AS A RESULT OF THE YOGA INTERVENTION. CONCLUSION: THIS PILOT STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT PARTICIPATION IN YOGA MAY PROVIDE BENEFITS FOR POSTURE AND STRENGTH IN WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER RELATED LYMPHOEDEMA. THE IMPROVEMENTS MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE FOCUS OF YOGA ON OVERALL POSTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL MOVEMENT PATTERNS. FURTHER TRIALS WITH LONGER INTERVENTION THAT FOLLOW THIS METHODOLOGY ARE WARRANTED.

6 2791  32 YOGA THERAPY FOR BREAST CANCER PATIENTS: A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY. WE SOUGHT TO STUDY THE IMPACT OF YOGA THERAPY ON ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND PHYSICAL HEALTH IN BREAST CANCER PATIENTS. STAGE I-III POST-OPERATIVE BREAST CANCER PATIENTS WERE RECRUITED WITH TWELVE 1-H WEEKLY YOGA SESSIONS COMPLETED WITH AN EXPERIENCED YOGA INSTRUCTOR. BEFORE AND AFTER EACH MODULE COMPLETION, ASSESSMENTS WERE OBTAINED WITH THE HOSPITAL ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION SCALE (HADS), THE DALLAS PAIN SCALE AND SHOULDER FLEXIBILITY MEASUREMENTS. FOURTEEN PATIENTS COMPLETED THE ENTIRE YOGA SESSION WITH 42.8% HAVING A TOTAL MASTECTOMY AND 15.4% HAVING BREAST RECONSTRUCTION. BOTH RIGHT AND LEFT SHOULDER ABDUCTION FLEXIBILITY SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED (P = 0.004; P = 0.015 RESPECTIVELY) AS WELL AS LEFT SHOULDER FLEXION (P = 0.046). AN IMPROVEMENT TREND IN SCORES FOR THE HADS AND DALLAS QUESTIONNAIRES PRE- AND POST-INTERVENTION WAS FOUND, ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. OUR DATA INDICATES AN IMPROVEMENT IN PHYSICAL FUNCTION IN ADDITION TO A CONSISTENT AMELIORATION IN ANXIETY, DEPRESSION AND PAIN SYMPTOMS AFTER A YOGA INTERVENTION.	2013	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
7 2070  32 THE EFFECT OF A HATHA YOGA PRACTICE ON HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY. PURPOSE: TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF A 7-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION ON HAMSTRINGS FLEXIBILITY USING A DIGITAL GONIOMETER. IT WAS HYPOTHESIZED THAT HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY WILL INCREASE IN A YOUNG HEALTHY ADULT POPULATION. METHODS: THIRTY-ONE COLLEGE-AGED MALES AND FEMALES (MAGE= 21 +/- 2.62) YEARS PARTICIPATED IN 110 MINUTES TWICE PER WEEK FOR A 7-WEEK PROGRESSIVE YOGA INTERVENTION. PRE AND POST-TEST MEASUREMENTS WERE TAKEN TO DETERMINE HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY ON THE RIGHT AND LEFT LEG USING A DIGITAL GONIOMETER. RESULTS: A PAIRED SAMPLES T-TEST INDICATED A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE PRE AND POST-TEST ON HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY (P < .05). RESULTS FOR THE RIGHT LEG PRE-TEST (T(30) = -6.64, P <0.05, 95% CI (-6.14, -3.25), D = 0.77. P < 0.05 AS WELL AS A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE LEFT PRE AND POST-ROM (T(30) = -6.93, P <0.05, 95% CI (-2.97, -6.79), D = 0.52, P < 0.05 INDICATED AN IMPROVEMENT AFTER THE INTERVENTION. AVERAGE RANGE OF MOTION INCREASE WAS 4 DEGREES IN BOTH LEGS. CONCLUSION: HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY CAN BE IMPROVED WITH A PROGRESSIVE 7-WEEK HATHA YOGA SESSION AND MAY BE USED AS A MODALITY TO IMPROVE FLEXIBILITY AND FUNCTION IN ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING AS WELL AND ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
8 2154  38 THE EFFECTS OF THAI YOGA ON PHYSICAL FITNESS: A META-ANALYSIS OF RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIALS. OBJECTIVES: THAI YOGA IS A TRADITIONAL THAI EXERCISE USED FOR IMPROVING HEALTH-RELATED PHYSICAL FITNESS. MANY STUDIES HAVE EVALUATED THESE EFFECTS, BUT THEIR RESULTS REMAIN INCONCLUSIVE. THIS META-ANALYSIS AIMED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THAI YOGA ON PHYSICAL FITNESS. DESIGN/METHODS: PUBMED, EMBASE, CINAHL, COCHRANE LIBRARY, THAI LIBRARY INTEGRATED SYSTEM (THAILIS), PHYSIOTHERAPY EVIDENCE DATABASE (PEDRO), NATIONAL REHABILITATION INFORMATION CENTER (REHABDATA), SCOPUS, WEB OF SCIENCE, THAI UNIVERSITY LIBRARY DATABASES/JOURNALS, AND THAI PHYSICAL THERAPY DATABASE UP TO MARCH 2016 WERE SEARCHED FOR RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIALS (RCTS) EXAMINING THE EFFECT OF THAI YOGA EXERCISE COMPARED WITH NORMAL DAILY ACTIVITIES AS CONTROLS, IN ANY LANGUAGE. THE WEIGHTED MEAN DIFFERENCE (WMD) AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (95% CI) WERE PERFORMED USING THE RANDOM-EFFECTS MODEL. RESULTS: SEVEN RCTS MET THE INCLUSION CRITERIA. THAI YOGA TRAINING SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED BODY FLEXIBILITY BY 3.9 CM AFTER 4 WEEKS [95% CI = 3.9-4.0; P < 0.001: NO HETEROGENEITY CHI(2) = 0.66, D.F.2, P = 0.7; I(2) 0.00%] AND 8.9 CM AFTER 8 WEEKS [95% CI = 7.4-10.5; P < 0.001: NO HETEROGENEITY CHI(2) = 0.16, D.F.2, P = 0.9; I(2) 0.00%] COMPARED TO CONTROLS. IT ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED RANGE OF MOTION (ROM) OF RIGHT SHOULDER EXTENSION BY 1.5 DEGREES AT WEEK 8, COMPARED TO CONTROLS [95% CI = 0.12-2.81; P = 0.03; LOW HETEROGENEITY CHI(2) = 1.61, D.F.1, P = 0.2; I(2) 37.9%]. GREATER ROM FOR RIGHT SHOULDER ABDUCTION WAS OBSERVED AFTER 12 WEEKS COMPARED TO CONTROLS [22.2 DEGREES (95% CI = 20-24; P < 0.001): NO HETEROGENEITY CHI(2) = 0.29, D.F.1, P = 0.6; I(2) 0.00%]. CONCLUSIONS: THAI YOGA EXERCISES APPEARED USEFUL, IN PARTICULAR, ON BODY AND RIGHT SHOULDER JOINT FLEXIBILITY.

9 1047  39 EFFECTS OF YOGA ON ARM VOLUME AMONG WOMEN WITH BREAST CANCER RELATED LYMPHEDEMA: A PILOT STUDY. LYMPHEDEMA AFFECTS 3-58% OF SURVIVORS OF BREAST CANCER AND CAN RESULT IN UPPER EXTREMITY IMPAIRMENTS. EXERCISE CAN BE BENEFICIAL IN MANAGING LYMPHEDEMA. YOGA PRACTICE HAS BEEN MINIMALLY STUDIED FOR ITS EFFECTS ON BREAST CANCER RELATED LYMPHEDEMA (BCRL). THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF YOGA ON ARM VOLUME, QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL), SELF-REPORTED ARM FUNCTION, AND HAND GRIP STRENGTH IN WOMEN WITH BCRL. SIX WOMEN WITH BCRL PARTICIPATED IN MODIFIED HATHA YOGA 3X/WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS. COMPRESSION SLEEVES WERE WORN DURING YOGA SESSIONS. ARM VOLUME, QOL, SELF-REPORTED ARM FUNCTION, AND HAND GRIP STRENGTH WERE MEASURED AT BASELINE, HALF-WAY, AND AT THE CONCLUSION OF YOGA PRACTICE. ARM VOLUME SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED FROM BASELINE (2423.3 ML +/- 597.2) TO FINAL MEASURES (2370.8 ML +/- 577.2) (P = .02). NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN QOL (P = .12), SELF-REPORTED ARM FUNCTION (P = .34), OR HAND GRIP STRENGTH (P = .26) WERE FOUND. YOGA MAY BE BENEFICIAL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF LYMPHEDEMA.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
10 2712  39 YOGA LEADS TO MULTIPLE PHYSICAL IMPROVEMENTS AFTER STROKE, A PILOT STUDY. OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS CHANGE IN PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING (PAIN, RANGE OF MOTION (ROM), STRENGTH, AND ENDURANCE) AFTER 8 WEEKS OF THERAPEUTIC-YOGA. DESIGN: PLANNED ANALYSES OF DATA FROM A RANDOMIZED PILOT STUDY OF YOGA AFTER STROKE. SETTING: UNIVERSITY-BASED RESEARCH LABORATORY. PARTICIPANTS: PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC STROKE (N=47) RANDOMIZED TO THERAPEUTIC-YOGA (N=37) OR WAIT-LIST CONTROL (N=10). INTERVENTIONS: 16 SESSIONS OF THERAPEUTIC YOGA (TWICE A WEEK/8 WEEKS). YOGA WAS DELIVERED IN A STANDARDIZED AND PROGRESSIVE FORMAT WITH POSTURES, BREATHING, AND MEDITATION, AND RELAXATION IN SITTING, STANDING, AND SUPINE. MAIN MEASURES: PAIN WAS ASSESSED WITH THE PEG, A 3-ITEM FUNCTIONAL MEASURE OF THE INTERFERENCE OF PAIN. ROM INCLUDED NECK AND HIP ACTIVE AND PASSIVE ROM MEASUREMENTS). UPPER AND LOWER EXTREMITY STRENGTH WERE ASSESSED WITH THE ARM CURL TEST AND CHAIR-TO-STAND TEST, RESPECTIVELY. ENDURANCE WAS ASSESSED WITH THE 6-MINUTE WALK AND MODIFIED 2-MIN STEP TEST. RESULTS: AFTER A BONFERRONI CORRECTION, PAIN, NECK ROM, HIP PASSIVE ROM, UPPER EXTREMITY STRENGTH, AND THE 6-MIN WALK SCORES ALL SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED AFTER 8 WEEKS OF ENGAGING IN YOGA. NO CHANGES OCCURRED IN THE WAIT-LIST CONTROL GROUP. CONCLUSIONS: A GROUP THERAPEUTIC-YOGA INTERVENTION MAY IMPROVE MULTIPLE ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL FUNCTIONING AFTER STROKE. SUCH AN INTERVENTION MAY BE COMPLEMENTARY TO TRADITIONAL REHABILITATION.	2014	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
11  992  30 EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA PRACTICE ON THE HEALTH-RELATED ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL FITNESS. TEN HEALTHY, UNTRAINED VOLUNTEERS (NINE FEMALES AND ONE MALE), RANGING IN AGE FROM 18-27 YEARS, WERE STUDIED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF HATHA YOGA PRACTICE ON THE HEALTH-RELATED ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL FITNESS, INCLUDING MUSCULAR STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE, FLEXIBILITY, CARDIORESPIRATORY FITNESS, BODY COMPOSITION, AND PULMONARY FUNCTION. SUBJECTS WERE REQUIRED TO ATTEND A MINIMUM OF TWO YOGA CLASSES PER WEEK FOR A TOTAL OF 8 WEEKS. EACH YOGA SESSION CONSISTED OF 10 MINUTES OF PRANAYAMAS (BREATH-CONTROL EXERCISES), 15 MINUTES OF DYNAMIC WARM-UP EXERCISES, 50 MINUTES OF ASANAS (YOGA POSTURES), AND 10 MINUTES OF SUPINE RELAXATION IN SAVASANA (CORPSE POSE). THE SUBJECTS WERE EVALUATED BEFORE AND AFTER THE 8-WEEK TRAINING PROGRAM. ISOKINETIC MUSCULAR STRENGTH FOR ELBOW EXTENSION, ELBOW FLEXION, AND KNEE EXTENSION INCREASED BY 31%, 19%, AND 28% (P<0.05), RESPECTIVELY, WHEREAS ISOMETRIC MUSCULAR ENDURANCE FOR KNEE FLEXION INCREASED 57% (P<0.01). ANKLE FLEXIBILITY, SHOULDER ELEVATION, TRUNK EXTENSION, AND TRUNK FLEXION INCREASED BY 13% (P<0.01), 155% (P<0.001), 188% (P<0.001), AND 14% (P<0.05), RESPECTIVELY. ABSOLUTE AND RELATIVE MAXIMAL OXYGEN UPTAKE INCREASED BY 7% AND 6%, RESPECTIVELY (P<0.01). THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT REGULAR HATHA YOGA PRACTICE CAN ELICIT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE HEALTH-RELATED ASPECTS OF PHYSICAL FITNESS.

12 1752  33 PILOT-TESTING THE EFFECTS OF A NEWLY-DEVELOPED SILVER YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM FOR FEMALE SENIORS. THIS STUDY AIMED TO PILOT-TEST THE HEALTH PROMOTION EFFECTS OF A SILVER YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM FOR FEMALE SENIORS. USING A ONE-GROUP, PRE-POST TEST DESIGN, A CONVENIENCE SAMPLE OF 16 COMMUNITY-DWELLING FEMALE SENIORS WAS RECRUITED. THE SILVER YOGA EXERCISE INTERVENTION WAS ADMINISTERED THREE TIMES A WEEK, 70 MINUTES PER SESSION, FOR FOUR WEEKS. DATA WERE COLLECTED AT BASELINE AND AFTER COMPLETION OF THE FOUR-WEEK INTERVENTION. RESULTS INDICATED THAT PARTICIPANTS' BODY FAT PERCENTAGE AND SYSTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE DECREASED, BALANCE AND RANGE OF MOTION ON SHOULDER FLEXION AND ABDUCTION IMPROVED, AND SLEEP DISTURBANCE WAS MINIMIZED (ALL P < .05). PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE SUPPORTS THAT THE SILVER YOGA EXERCISE PROGRAM PROVIDES POSITIVE EFFECTS ON THE PROMOTION OF GOOD HEALTH IN FEMALE SENIORS LIVING IN THE COMMUNITIES.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
13 1277  35 FUNCTIONAL STATUS IN ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS - YOGA VS. PHYSIOTHERAPY: A QUASI EXPERIMENTAL STUDY. OBJECTIVES: ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS RESULTS IN A MULTIDIMENSIONAL DISABILITY WHICH DEMANDS A POLYGONAL APPROACH. ALTHOUGH PHYSIOTHERAPY PROVES AN ESSENTIAL FOR A COMPLETE AND COMPREHENSIVE RECOVERY IN ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS, EVIDENCE ALSO SUGGEST THE ROLE OF YOGA IN THE MANAGEMENT, HENCE THIS STUDY INVESTIGATE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS. METHODS: THIS IS A QUASI-RANDOMISED CONTROL STUDY. A PRE-DIAGNOSED SUBACUTE AND CHRONIC ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS OF SHOULDER, BETWEEN THE AGE GROUP OF 35-60 YEARS OF BOTH GENDERS OF TOTAL 40 PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO GROUP 'A' (YOGASANA) AND GROUP 'B' (PHYSIOTHERAPY). THE PARAMETERS OF PAIN, JOINT MOBILITY AND FUNCTIONAL DISABILITIES WERE MEASURED AT THE BASELINE AND AFTER FOUR-WEEKS. RESULTS: THE MEAN AGE OF GROUP 'A' WAS 45.4 +/- 7.78 YEARS WHEREAS 50.05 +/- 5.98 YEARS WAS IN GROUP 'B'. INTRAGROUP ANALYSIS FOR BOTH THE GROUPS SHOWED STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN ALL THE STUDY VARIABLES. WHEREAS IN INTERGROUP ANALYSIS YOGASANA WAS FOUND TO BE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IN IMPROVING SHOULDER ABDUCTION MOBILITY, P=0.03, EFFECT SIZE R=0.35 AND ALSO IN SHOULDER FLEXION (P=0.15, R=0.23) AND SHOULDER INTERNAL ROTATION (P=0.07, R=0.3), THOUGH STATISTICALLY NOT SIGNIFICANT, IN VIEW OF SMALL EFFECT SIZE RESPONSE. CONCLUSIONS: BOTH TECHNIQUES IMPROVED THE FUNCTIONAL STATUS IN ADHESIVE CAPSULITIS, HOWEVER ADDITIONAL EFFECTS ON JOINT MOBILITY WAS DEMONSTRATED BY YOGASANA.	2020	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
14 1947  37 SAUNA YOGA SUPERIORLY IMPROVES FLEXIBILITY, STRENGTH, AND BALANCE: A TWO-ARMED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL IN HEALTHY OLDER ADULTS. BESIDES STRENGTH AND BALANCE, FLEXIBILITY IS AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF HEALTH-RELATED PHYSICAL FITNESS. THUS, THE AIM OF THIS TWO-ARMED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT TRIAL WAS TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER SAUNA YOGA AT A MODERATE TEMPERATURE (50 DEGREES C) BENEFICIALLY AFFECTS FLEXIBILITY, STRENGTH, BALANCE, AND QUALITY OF LIFE (QOL) IN HEALTHY ELDERLY COMMUNITY DWELLERS. PARTICIPANTS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO AN INTERVENTION GROUP (INT, N = 11, AGE: 68.7 +/- 5.9) OR CONTROL GROUP (CON, N = 12, AGE: 69.3 +/- 4.9), USING THE MINIMIZATION METHOD. AGE, PHYSICAL ACTIVITY, GENDER, AND THE PRIMARY OUTCOME FLEXIBILITY WERE USED AS STRATA FOR GROUP ALLOCATION. BOTH GROUPS COMPLETED SIMILAR EXERCISES IN THE SAUNA OVER EIGHT WEEKS. ONLY THE INT GROUP WAS EXPOSED TO MODERATE TEMPERATURES OF 50 DEGREES C. LARGE AND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN FAVOR OF THE SAUNA GROUP (INT) WAS OBSERVED FOR THE CHAIR SIT-AND-REACH TEST (INT: +83%, CON +3%, P = 0.028, NSMALL ER, CYRILLIC(2) = 0.24). THE SHOULDER AND LATERAL SPINE FLEXIBILITY WERE NOT RELEVANTLY AFFECTED. STRENGTH IN THE LOWER EXTREMITIES MERELY SHOWED A TENDENCY TO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES (INT: 16%, CON: 3%, P = 0.061, NSMALL ER, CYRILLIC(2) = 0.181). ADDITIONALLY, BALANCE ABILITIES, WITH EYES CLOSED, IMPROVED (INT: 187%, CON +58%, P = 0.056, NSMALL ER, CYRILLIC(2) = 0.189) IN FAVOR OF THE INT GROUP. QOL ONLY IMPROVED IN FAVOR OF THE INT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL DIMENSION (INT: +7%, CON: 0%, P = 0.034, NSMALL ER, CYRILLIC(2) = 0.227). THESE FIRST BUT PRELIMINARY FINDINGS INDICATE THAT SAUNA YOGA MAY SERVE AS A PROMISING AND FEASIBLE MEANS TO IMPROVE FLEXIBILITY IN ELDERLY PEOPLE. STRENGTH AND BALANCE DO NOT MEANINGFULLY BENEFIT FROM A SAUNA ENVIRONMENT, ALTHOUGH STRENGTH IMPROVED TO A SLIGHTLY HIGHER EXTENT IN THE SAUNA GROUP. FUTURE LARGE-SCALE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO ELUCIDATE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS AND CORROBORATE THESE FINDINGS.	2019	
                                                                                                                                 
15  387  32 BENEFITS OF THAI YOGA ON PHYSICAL MOBILITY AND LOWER LIMB MUSCLE STRENGTH IN OVERWEIGHT/OBESE OLDER WOMEN: A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT TRIAL. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: ALTHOUGH THAI YOGA (TY) IS REPORTED TO IMPROVE HEALTH-RELATED FITNESS FOR THE ELDERLY, NO STUDY HAS YET CARRIED OUT THE EFFECT OF TY PROGRAM ON PHYSICAL MOBILITY AND LOWER-LIMB MUSCLE STRENGTH IN OVERWEIGHT/OBESE OLDER WOMEN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: IN A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED PILOT DESIGN, TWENTY-TWO SEDENTARY WOMEN WITH A BMI >/= 23 KG/M(2), AGED 62 +/- 1 YEARS WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER A TY GROUP FOR 60 MIN, 3 TIMES A WEEK OR TO A "NO EXERCISE" CONTROL (CON) GROUP. SIT AND REACH (SRT), FUNCTIONAL REACH (FRT) AND 30-S CHAIR STAND (CST-30), 8-FOOT UP AND GO (8UGT), 6-MIN WALK (6MWT)) AND LOWER-LIMB MUSCLE STRENGTH WERE MEASURED AT THE BEGINNING, 4, AND 8 WEEKS. RESULTS: AT WEEK 4, A SIGNIFICANT BETWEEN GROUPS WAS OBTAINED IN CST-30, 8UGT, AND 6MWT. AT WEEK 8, FRT, 8UGT, 6MWT AND KNEE FLEXOR AND EXTENSOR MUSCLE STRENGTH WERE IMPROVED IN THE TY OVER THE CON. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT WAS FOUND IN ALL VARIABLES WITHIN THE TY, BUT NO CHANGE WAS OBSERVED IN THE CON. CONCLUSION: AN 8-WEEK TY PROGRAM APPEARS TO PROVIDE BENEFICIAL IMPROVEMENTS IN PHYSICAL MOBILITY IN OVERWEIGHT/OBESE OLDER WOMEN.	2021	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
16  943  31 EFFECTS OF A 12-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION ON CARDIORESPIRATORY ENDURANCE, MUSCULAR STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE, AND FLEXIBILITY IN HONG KONG CHINESE ADULTS: A CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIAL. OBJECTIVE. TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF A 12-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION ON CARDIORESPIRATORY ENDURANCE, MUSCULAR STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE, AND FLEXIBILITY IN CHINESE ADULTS. METHODS. 173 ADULTS (AGED 52.0 +/- 7.5 YEARS) WERE ASSIGNED TO EITHER THE YOGA INTERVENTION GROUP (N = 87) OR THE WAITLIST CONTROL GROUP (N = 86). 19 DROPPED OUT FROM THE STUDY. PRIMARY OUTCOMES WERE CHANGES IN CARDIORESPIRATORY ENDURANCE (RESTING HEART RATE (HR) AND MAXIMAL OXYGEN UPTAKE (VO2MAX)), MUSCULAR STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE (CURL-UP AND PUSH-UP TESTS), AND LOWER BACK AND HAMSTRING FLEXIBILITY (THE MODIFIED BACK-SAVER SIT-AND-REACH (MBS) TEST). RESULTS. COMPARED TO CONTROLS, THE YOGA GROUP ACHIEVED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS IN VO2MAX (P < 0.01), CURL-UP (P < 0.05) AND PUSH-UP (P < 0.001) TESTS, AND THE MBS LEFT AND RIGHT LEG TESTS (BOTH P < 0.001) IN BOTH GENDERS. SIGNIFICANT CHANGE WAS ALSO FOUND FOR RESTING HR BETWEEN GROUPS IN WOMEN (P < 0.05) BUT NOT IN MEN. FURTHER ANALYSIS COMPARING PARTICIPANTS BETWEEN YOUNGER AND OLDER SUBGROUPS YIELDED SIMILAR FINDINGS, EXCEPT THAT THE OLDER PARTICIPANTS IN THE YOGA GROUP FAILED TO IMPROVE RESTING HR OR THE CURL-UP TEST VERSUS CONTROL. ADHERENCE (89%) AND ATTENDANCE (94%) WERE HIGH. NO SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS OCCURRED. CONCLUSION. A 12-WEEK HATHA YOGA INTERVENTION HAS FAVORABLE EFFECTS ON CARDIORESPIRATORY ENDURANCE, MUSCULAR STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE, AND FLEXIBILITY IN CHINESE ADULTS.	2015

18 2499  33 YOGA AS STEADINESS TRAINING: EFFECTS ON MOTOR VARIABILITY IN YOUNG ADULTS. EXERCISE TRAINING PROGRAMS CAN INCREASE STRENGTH AND IMPROVE SUBMAXIMAL FORCE CONTROL, BUT THE EFFECTS OF YOGA AS AN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF STEADINESS TRAINING ARE NOT WELL DESCRIBED. THE PURPOSE WAS TO EXPLORE THE EFFECT OF A POPULAR TYPE OF YOGA (BIKRAM) ON STRENGTH, STEADINESS, AND BALANCE. YOUNG ADULTS PERFORMED YOGA TRAINING (N = 10, 29 +/- 6 YEARS, 24 YOGA SESSIONS IN 8 WEEKS) OR SERVED AS CONTROLS (N = 11, 26 +/- 7 YEARS). YOGA SESSIONS CONSISTED OF 1.5 HOURS OF SUPERVISED, STANDARDIZED POSTURES. MEASURES BEFORE AND AFTER TRAINING INCLUDED MAXIMUM VOLUNTARY CONTRACTION (MVC) FORCE OF THE ELBOW FLEXORS (EF) AND KNEE EXTENSORS (KE), STEADINESS OF ISOMETRIC EF AND KE CONTRACTIONS, STEADINESS OF CONCENTRIC (CON) AND ECCENTRIC (ECC) KE CONTRACTIONS, AND TIMED BALANCE. THE STANDARD DEVIATION (SD) AND COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION (CV, SD/MEAN FORCE) OF ISOMETRIC FORCE AND THE SD OF ACCELERATION DURING CON AND ECC CONTRACTIONS WERE MEASURED. AFTER YOGA TRAINING, MVC FORCE INCREASED 14% FOR KE (479 +/- 175 TO 544 +/- 187 N, P < 0.05) AND WAS UNCHANGED FOR THE EF MUSCLES (219 +/- 85 TO 230 +/- 72 N, P > 0.05). THE CV OF FORCE WAS UNCHANGED FOR EF (1.68 TO 1.73%, P > 0.05) BUT WAS REDUCED IN THE KE MUSCLES SIMILARLY FOR YOGA AND CONTROL GROUPS (2.04 TO 1.55%, P < 0.05). THE VARIABILITY OF CON AND ECC CONTRACTIONS WAS UNCHANGED. FOR THE YOGA GROUP, IMPROVEMENT IN KE STEADINESS WAS CORRELATED WITH PRETRAINING STEADINESS (R = -0.62 TO -0.84, P < 0.05); SUBJECTS WITH THE GREATEST KE FORCE FLUCTUATIONS BEFORE TRAINING EXPERIENCED THE GREATEST REDUCTIONS WITH TRAINING. PERCENT CHANGE IN BALANCE TIME FOR INDIVIDUAL YOGA SUBJECTS AVERAGED +228% (19.5 +/- 14 TO 34.3 +/- 18 SECONDS, P < 0.05), WITH NO CHANGE IN CONTROLS. FOR YOUNG ADULTS, A SHORT-TERM YOGA PROGRAM OF THIS TYPE CAN IMPROVE BALANCE SUBSTANTIALLY, PRODUCE MODEST IMPROVEMENTS IN LEG STRENGTH, AND IMPROVE LEG MUSCLE CONTROL FOR LESS-STEADY SUBJECTS.	2008	
                                                                                                                                                           
19 1693  32 OXYGEN CONSUMPTION DURING VINIYOGA PRACTICE IN ADULTS. CONTEXT: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO MEASURE THE OXYGEN CONSUMPTION (VO2) DURING VINIYOGA YOGA MOVEMENTS (ASANAS) AND TO COMPARE VO2 WALKING AMONG ADULTS. METHODS: YOGA PRACTITIONERS (N = 10) WERE RECRUITED TO MEASURE VO2 WHILE AT REST (30 MIN), PRACTICING YOGA (16 MOVEMENTS WITH DIFFERENT VARIATIONS), AND TREADMILL WALKING AT 2 MPH (10 MIN) AND 3 MPH (10 MIN). VO2 WAS MEASURED USING A WHOLE-ROOM INDIRECT CALORIMETRY. EACH YOGA MOVEMENT WAS CATEGORIZED BY BODY ORIENTATION AS STANDING, LYING, AND SITTING. THE DIFFERENCES IN VO2 BETWEEN YOGA AND WALKING WERE EXAMINED USING PEARSON'S CORRELATIONS. DIFFERENCES IN VO2 BETWEEN POSES (STANDING, SITTING, AND LYING) WERE EXAMINED USING LINEAR REGRESSION MODELS. VO2. RESULTS: MEAN YOGA-VO2 FOR THE ENTIRE YOGA SESSION WAS 3.7 (STANDARD DEVIATION [SD] 0.43, RANGE: 4.4-8.9) ML/KG/MIN. YOGA-VO2 VARIED BY BODY ORIENTATION: STANDING = 7.5 (SD = 1.5) ML/KG/MIN, LYING = 5.3 (SD = 1.0) ML/KG/MIN, AND SITTING = 5.4 (SD = 1.1) ML/KG/MIN. AFTER ADJUSTING FOR BODY MASS, FREQUENCY OF YOGA PRACTICE, AND RESTING ENERGY EXPENDITURE, FEMALE GENDER WAS NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH MEAN YOGA VO2 FOR STANDING (B = -112.19, P < 0.05), LYING (B = -141.87, P < 0.05), AND SITTING (B = -129.96, P < 0.05). MEAN VO2 FOR WALKING 2 MPH WAS COMPARABLE WITH SITTING (R = 0.836, P < 0.05) AND LYING (R = 0.735, P < 0.05) WHEREAS WALKING AT 3 MPH WAS COMPARABLE WITH STANDING (R = 0.718, P < 0.05) AND SITTING (R = 0.760, P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: WE CONCLUDE THAT VO2 DURING YOGA PRACTICE IS COMPARABLE TO VO2 DURING SLOW TREADMILL WALKING AND MAY VARY BASED ON GENDER AND BODY ORIENTATION.	2018	
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
20  675  41 EFFECT OF A SIX-MONTH YOGA EXERCISE INTERVENTION ON FITNESS OUTCOMES FOR BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS. YOGA-BASED EXERCISE HAS PROVEN TO BE BENEFICIAL FOR PRACTITIONERS, INCLUDING CANCER SURVIVORS. THIS STUDY REPORTS ON THE IMPROVEMENTS IN PHYSICAL FITNESS FOR 20 BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS WHO PARTICIPATED IN A SIX-MONTH YOGA-BASED EXERCISE PROGRAM (YE). RESULTS ARE COMPARED TO A COMPREHENSIVE EXERCISE (CE) PROGRAM GROUP AND A COMPARISON (C) EXERCISE GROUP WHO CHOSE THEIR OWN EXERCISES. "PRE" AND "POST" FITNESS ASSESSMENTS INCLUDED MEASURES OF ANTHROPOMETRICS, CARDIORESPIRATORY CAPACITY, STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY. DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS, EFFECT SIZE (D), DEPENDENT SAMPLE 'T' TESTS FOR ALL OUTCOME MEASURES WERE CALCULATED FOR THE YE GROUP. SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS INCLUDED: DECREASED % BODY FAT (-3.00%, D = -0.44, P < 0.001); INCREASED SIT TO STAND LEG STRENGTH REPETITIONS (2.05, D = 0.48, P = 0.003); FORWARD REACH (3.59 CM, D = 0.61, P = 0.01); AND RIGHT ARM SAGITTAL RANGE OF MOTION (6.50 DEGREES , D = 0.92, P = 0.05). TO COMPARE YE OUTCOMES WITH THE OTHER TWO GROUPS, A ONE-WAY ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE (ANOVA) WAS USED. YE PARTICIPANTS SIGNIFICANTLY OUTPERFORMED C PARTICIPANTS ON "FORWARD REACH" (3.59 CM GAINED VERSUS -2.44 CM LOST), (P = 0.009) AND OUTPERFORMED CE PARTICIPANTS (3.59 CM GAINED VERSUS 1.35 CM GAINED), BUT NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. OUR RESULTS SUPPORT YOGA-BASED EXERCISE MODIFIED FOR BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS AS SAFE AND EFFECTIVE.	2015
